HTA findings also help to improve the quality of the service in the NHS indirectly in\nthat they form a key component of the \u2018National Knowledge Service\u2019 that is being developed to improve\nthe evidence of clinical practice throughout the NHS.\nThe HTA Programme was set up in 1993. Its role is to ensure that high-quality research information on\nthe costs, effectiveness and broader impact of health technologies is produced in the most efficient way\nfor those who use, manage and provide care in the NHS. \u2018Health technologies\u2019 are broadly defined to\ninclude all interventions used to promote health, prevent and treat disease, and improve rehabilitation\nand long-term care, rather than settings of care.\nThe HTA Programme commissions research only on topics where it has identified key gaps in the\nevidence needed by the NHS. Suggestions for topics are actively sought from people working in the\nNHS, the public, service-users groups and professional bodies such as Royal Colleges and NHS Trusts. \nResearch suggestions are carefully considered by panels of independent experts (including service users)\nwhose advice results in a ranked list of recommended research priorities. The HTA Programme then\ncommissions the research team best suited to undertake the work, in the manner most appropriate to find\nthe relevant answers. Some projects may take only months, others need several years to answer the\nresearch questions adequately. They may involve synthesising existing evidence or conducting a trial to\nproduce new evidence where none currently exists.\nAdditionally, through its Technology Assessment Report (TAR) call-off contract, the HTA Programme is\nable to commission bespoke reports, principally for NICE, but also for other policy customers, such as a\nNational Clinical Director. TARs bring together evidence on key aspects of the use of specific\ntechnologies and usually have to be completed within a short time period.\nCriteria for inclusion in the HTA monograph series\nReports are published in the HTA monograph series if (1) they have resulted from work commissioned\nfor the HTA Programme, and (2) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the referees\nand editors.\nReviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed \u2018systematic\u2019 when the account of the search,\nappraisal and synthesis methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the\nreplication of the review by others.\nThe research reported in this monograph was commissioned by the HTA Programme as project number\n04\/41\/01.

GObjectives: The aim of this review is to examine the\nclinical and cost-effectiveness of screening for lung\ncancer using computed tomography (CT) to assist\npolicy making and to clarify research needs.\nData sources: Electronic databases and Internet\nresources.\nReview methods: A systematic review was\nundertaken and selected studies were assessed using\nthe checklists and methods described in NHS Centre\nfor Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) Report 4.\nSeparate narrative summaries were performed for\nclinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Cost-\neffectiveness analysis resulting in a cost per quality-\nadjusted life-year was not feasible, therefore the main\nelements of such an appraisal were summarised and\nthe key issues relating to the existing evidence base\nwere discussed.\nResults: Twelve studies of CT screening for lung\ncancer were identified, including two randomised\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) and ten studies of screening\nwithout comparator groups. The quality of reporting of\nthese studies was variable, but the overall quality was\nadequate. The two RCTs were of short duration \n(1 year) and therefore there was currently no evidence\nthat screening improves survival or reduces mortality.\nThe proportion of people with abnormal CT findings\nvaried widely between studies (5\u201351%). The\nprevalence of lung cancer detected was between 0.4%\nand 3.2% (number need to screen to detect one lung\ncancer = 31\u2013249). Incidence rates of lung cancer were\nlower (0.1\u20131% per year). Detection of stage I and\nresectable tumours was high, 100% in some studies.\nAdverse events, as a result of investigation or surgery,\nor the screening process per se were poorly reported.\nIncidental findings of other abnormalities requiring\nmedical follow-up were reported to be as high as 49%.\nSix full economic evaluations of population CT\nscreening programmes for lung cancer were included in\nthe review. The magnitude of cost-effectiveness ratios\nreported varied widely. None was set in the UK and\ngeneralisation was complicated by wide variation in the\ndata used in different countries and a paucity of UK\ndata for comparison. All six made the fundamental\nassumption that screening with CT for lung cancer\nreduced mortality. At the current time, there is no\nevidence to support that assumption. In the absence of\nevidence of health gains from screening for lung cancer,\nin terms of either quantity or quality of life, and faced\nwith a range of uncertainties, from the frequency of\nabnormal screening findings within a population to the\nnatural history of screening detected lung cancers, it is\nnot feasible at the current time to develop accurately\nand meaningfully an economic argument for CT\nscreening for lung cancer in the UK. For subgroups, in\nparticular certain occupational groups, there is\nevidence of increased risk of lung cancer, but the role\nof screening has not been demonstrated by the current\nstudies.\nConclusions: The accepted National Screening\nCommittee criteria are not currently met, with no\nRCTs, no evidence to support clinical effectiveness and\nno evidence of cost-effectiveness. RCTs are needed to\nexamine the effect of CT screening on mortality, either\nwith whole-population screening or for particular\nsubgroups; to determine the rate of positive screening\nand detected lung cancers.

This has largely\nstemmed from the results of chest X-ray screening\nstudies where improvements in survival were\nobtained but without reductions in disease-specific,\nor total, mortality. The debate raises two issues:\nthe design of studies to evaluate screening for\nlung cancer, in particular the choice of\ncomparator; and the potential role of over-\ndiagnosis of well-differentiated, slow-growing\ntumours that would not have led to symptoms or\ndeath in the lifetime of the affected patient.\nLung cancer is the leading cause of death from\ncancer in the UK, killing approximately 34,000\npeople per year. By the time symptoms develop,\nthe tumour is often at an advanced stage and the\nprognosis is bleak. Treatment at a less advanced\nstage of disease with surgical resection has been\nshown to substantially reduce mortality. Screening\nwould be attractive if it could detect\npresymptomatic lung cancer at a stage when\nsurgical intervention is feasible.\nObjectives\nThe aim of this review is to examine the clinical\nand cost-effectiveness of screening for lung cancer\nusing computed tomography (CT) to assist policy\nmaking and to clarify research needs.\nMethods\nSearch strategy\nFifteen electronic databases and Internet \nresources were searched from 1994 until\nDecember 2004\/January 2005. In addition,\nbibliographies of the retrieved articles were\nsearched and the register of projects held by the\nInternational Network of Agencies for HTA\n(INAHTA) was also checked.\nInclusion\/exclusion criteria\nStudies were included where screening for lung\ncancer was the principal theme of the paper. The\ninitial search was for randomised trials in which\nsurvival in a group receiving CT screening was\ncompared with a group not screened, but because\nof the lack of such studies, no restriction was\nplaced on study type. Studies were reviewed by two\nauthors independently. \nData extraction\nData extraction included details of the screening\nprotocol, follow-up, diagnosis and participants.\nInformation was sought about test characteristics,\nincluding sensitivity and specificity. The checklists\nand methods described in NHS Centre for\nReviews and Dissemination (CRD) Report 4 were\nused for the quality assessment of studies.\nAnalysis\nSeparate narrative summaries were performed for\nthe clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.\nCost-effectiveness analysis resulting in a cost per\nquality-adjusted life-year was not feasible,\ntherefore the main elements of such an appraisal\nwere summarised and the key issues relating to the\nexisting evidence base were discussed.\nResults\nSummary of clinical effectiveness\nIn total, 12 studies of CT screening for lung\ncancer were identified, including two randomised\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) and ten studies of\nscreening without comparator groups. The quality\nof reporting of these studies was variable, but the\noverall quality was adequate. The two RCTs were\nof short duration (1 year) and therefore there was\ncurrently no evidence that screening improves\nsurvival or reduces mortality. The proportion of\npeople with abnormal CT findings varied widely\nbetween studies (5\u201351%). The prevalence of lung\ncancer detected was between 0.4 and 3.2%\n(number need to screen to detect one lung cancer\n= 31\u2013249). Incidence rates of lung cancer were\nlower (0.1\u20131% per year). Detection of stage I and\nresectable tumours was high, 100% in some\nstudies. Adverse events, as a result of investigation\nor surgery, or the screening process per se were\npoorly reported. Incidental findings of other\nabnormalities requiring medical follow-up were\nreported to be as high as 49%.\nExecutive summaryx\nSummary of cost-effectiveness\nSix full economic evaluations of population CT\nscreening programmes for lung cancer were\nincluded in the review. The magnitude of cost-\neffectiveness ratios reported vary widely. None was\nset in the UK and generalisation was complicated\nby wide variation in the data used in different\ncountries and a paucity of UK data for\ncomparison. All six made the fundamental\nassumption that screening with CT for lung cancer\nreduced mortality. At the current time, there is no\nevidence to support that assumption.\nEconomic appraisal\nIn the absence of evidence of health gains from\nscreening for lung cancer, in terms of either\nquantity or quality of life, and faced with a range\nof uncertainties, from the frequency of abnormal\nscreening findings within a population to the\nnatural history of screening detected lung cancers,\nit is not feasible at the current time to develop\naccurately and meaningfully an economic\nargument for CT screening for lung cancer in the\nUK. For subgroups, in particular certain\noccupational groups, there is evidence of increased\nrisk of lung cancer, but the role of screening has\nnot been demonstrated by the current studies.\nConclusions\nThe accepted National Screening Committee\ncriteria are not currently met, with no RCTs, no\nevidence to support clinical effectiveness and no\nevidence of cost-effectiveness.\nRecommendations for research\nIn terms of what information is needed to assist\ndecision-making about CT screening for lung\ncancer, the following research priorities were\nidentified.\n  RCT evidence is needed about the effect of CT\nscreening on mortality, either with whole-\npopulation screening or for particular\nsubgroups. One such trial is underway in the\nUSA, recruiting 50,000 participants, and is due\nto end in 2009, although final follow-up will not\ncomplete until around 2014.\n  UK data about the rate of positive screening\nwith CT and detected lung cancers could be\nobtained from an RCT or a cohort study. Even\nrelatively small-scale studies would provide\nvaluable information when trying to assess the\ngeneralisability of RCT data currently being\nconducted elsewhere.\n  There is a need to understand better the\nnatural history and epidemiology of screening-\ndetected lung cancers, particularly small, well-\ndifferentiated adenocarcinomas. This could be\nmet, in part, by lung cancer screening RCTs or\ncohort studies, but a review of existing\npublished epidemiological and pathological\ndata, along with primary analysis of UK lung\ncancer epidemiology, would usefully inform\ncurrent understanding.\n  Information about the quality of life impact \nof CT screening, acceptability of screening, \nand uptake and retention rates in the UK \nwould be valuable in any future assessment \nof the cost-effectiveness of screening in \nthe UK.\n  Increased collection is needed of UK health\nservice data regarding resource use and safety\ndata for lung cancer management and \nservices.\n  Research is needed into the feasibility and\nlogistics of tracing people who have in the past\nworked in industry where there was exposure to\nlung carcinogens.\nExecutive summaryT\nhis review was commissioned by the UK HTA\nProgramme on behalf of the National\nScreening Committee (NSC). The aim of this\nreview is to examine the clinical effectiveness of\nscreening for lung cancer using computed\ntomography (CT), taking into account the effect\non mortality, detection of early disease and the\nimpact on quality of life. An economic appraisal is\nalso provided. One stimulus for the review has\nbeen publicity about the use of whole body CT\nscreening. This review will not consider the\neffectiveness of screening for conditions other\nthan lung cancer, but will report on incidental\ndisease findings. A separate review will consider\nthe case for screening for heart disease and, if\nappropriate, the economic case for dual screening\nwill be addressed.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n1\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

The principal hope for curative\ntreatment remains surgical resection, which\nrequires tumours to be recognised early, before\nlocal invasion or remote spread of disease.1\nImprovements in CT technology, in particular the\nincreased rapidity of imaging facilitated by spiral\nCT, make the detection of smaller lung\nabnormalities and mass screening feasible, at least\nin theory. There is currently no mass-screening\nprogramme for lung cancer in the UK.\nThis technology appraisal was undertaken to\ninform the NSC discussions about the feasibility of\nscreening for lung cancer using CT. Following an\nintroduction to lung cancer and issues\nsurrounding screening in this chapter, the\nevidence regarding the clinical effectiveness\n(Chapter 3) and cost-effectiveness (Chapter 4) is\nreported. An economic appraisal is provided\n(Chapter 5). Compatibility with the NSC criteria\nfor a screening test is then examined (Chapter 6).\nFinally, the weaknesses of the research evidence,\nrecommendations for future research and the\nimplications for clinical practice are discussed\n(Chapter 7).\nLung cancer: the burden of disease\nLung cancer is the leading cause of death from\ncancer in the UK. Over the past two decades there\nhas been a reduction in incidence of lung cancer\nin men and a slowing in the rate of increase\namong women, related largely to the fall in\nsmoking rates and reduction in tar content in\ncigarettes. Despite this, approximately 34,000\npeople die annually from lung cancer across the\nUK: 20,000 men and 14,000 women. Overall\nsurvival after diagnosis is poor (less than 10% at\n5 years) with little improvement in the rates over\nthe past 10 years despite advances in\nchemotherapy regimens for lung cancer.2\nThe classification of lung cancer divides the\ndisease into three main types: non-small cell lung\ncancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC)\nand mesothelioma. NSCLC accounts for about\n83% of all lung cancers.2 Overall survival is poor\namong patients with NSCLC, but surgical resection\noffers a potential cure for some. Survival varies\nsubstantially with clinical stage of tumour at\ndiagnosis, with a 60\u201370% 5-year survival among\nthose with stage IA disease but less than 10% for\nthose with stage III disease or worse. Pathological\nstaging, based on a tissue biopsy and therefore\ngenerally considered to be more accurate, shows a\nsimilar pattern.2,3 More than 50% of people with\nlung cancer present with tumours at stage III or\nlater.2,4\nHistologically, the most common type of NSCLC\npresenting clinically is squamous cell carcinoma.\nIn the UK, it accounts for 35\u201345% of all lung\ncancers, with adenocarcinoma and large cell\naccounting for 15% and 10%, respectively.\nAdenocarcinoma is the least strongly associated\nwith smoking and generally occurs in periphery of\nthe lungs.2\nSCLC is typically aggressive, generally presenting\nwith invasive disease and surgery is rarely, if ever,\nindicated. Mesothelioma is a rare cancer of the\npleural lining of the lung accounting for less than\n1% of all lung cancer.4 It is strongly associated\nwith asbestos exposure. Like SCLC, the outlook\nafter diagnosis is bleak with little potential for\ncurative therapy at present. Given current\ntreatments, it is only people with NSCLC who\nhave a potential to benefit from a screening\nprogramme that would enable disease to be\nidentified before local or distant spread.\nThe risk of developing lung cancer varies across\nthe population and a number of risk factors can\nbe identified. The incidence of lung cancer rises\nwith age and is rare below the age of 40 years. The\nhighest incidence rate occurs among over 70-year-\nolds.2\nIn the UK, lung cancer remains more common in\nmen than women, despite the incidence falling in\nmen in recent years (Figure 1).5\nThe biggest single risk factor for lung cancer is\nsmoking, with 85\u201390% of all people who present\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n3\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

The risk of lung cancer among lifelong\nheavy smokers is up to 50 times that of non-\nsmokers of similar age.6 Close temporal links can\nbe seen between the fall over the past two decades\nin smoking frequency and cigarette tar yields, and\nmale lung cancer mortality. Former smokers\nexperience a substantial decline in risk of lung\ncancer as the time since last cigarette increases: \na 34% reduction in the first 10 years, and reducing\nto close to the risk for a lifelong non-smoker by \n30 years. Stopping smoking even up to the age of\n60 years has been shown to reduce substantially\nthe risk of developing lung cancer.7,8\nSmoking is by no means the only risk factor for\nlung cancer and increased risks of lung cancer\nhave been reported in association with a variety of\noccupational exposures. The estimated risk\nassociated with various occupations and key\nreviews are summarised below and in Appendix 1.\nLung cancer and occupation\nThe occupational contribution to lung cancer is\nunderestimated and tends to be appreciated only\nwhere a well-recognised potential cause is\nidentified, notably asbestos exposure. From a\nnumber of studies of specific workforce\npopulations the International Agency for Research\nin Cancer (IARC) has identified 16 specific\noccupations, exposures or processes that they class\nas having \u2018sufficient evidence\u2019 to say that they\ncause lung cancer (IARC evidence grade 1)9,10\n(Table 1, with fuller review in Appendix 1).\nThe two main causes of occupational lung cancer\nare asbestos and silica, but there remains\nconsiderable discussion as to whether lung cancer\ncan develop in the absence of associated lung\nfibrosis. For instance, the estimated relative risk\n(RR) for workers exposed to silica varies between\nno increased risk and a relative risk of\napproximately 1.3. However, patients with silicosis\nshow a greater increased risk (estimated RR\naround 2.3). A similar situation exists with respect\nto asbestos. The relative risk of lung cancer in\npatients with asbestosis is around six-fold higher\nthan in the non-exposed population, whereas\nasbestos exposure itself carries a smaller risk (RR\nvarying between 1.2 and 2.0 in selected studies,\nbut not increased in others).\nIn some occupations, carcinogenic exposures may\nbe multiple (e.g. chemical workers). In addition,\nmany workforces are increasingly exposed to diesel\nfumes, which are currently recognised to be a\n\u2018probable\u2019 (IARC class 2A) carcinogen. For\nworkforces where diesel is the only exposure, the\nestimated relative risk for lung cancer lies between\n1.3 and 1.5. A range of other occupations is\nassociated with an increased risk for lung cancer,\nalthough the relative risks are smaller than those\nseen with asbestos (see Appendix 1). It may,\ntherefore, be more important to consider\noccupation rather than specific exposures when\ndetermining whether a workforce may be\nconsidered for CT screening for lung cancer. It is\nalso important to note that the interpretation of\nmany of the studies contributing to the IARC\nBackground\n4\nMale incidence\nFemale incidence\nMale mortality\nFemale mortality\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001\nYear of diagnosis\/death\nR\na\nt\ne\n \np\ne\nr\n \n1\n0\n0\n,\n0\n0\n0\n \np\no\np\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\nFIGURE 1 Lung cancer incidence and mortality rates in the UK, 1975\u20132002. (Reproduced from Cancer Research UK.5)evidence base are complicated by heavy \nco-exposure to cigarette smoke.\nCertain workforce groups appear to be at greater\nrisk of lung cancer than the general population\nand some may, therefore, merit special\nconsideration when identifying a potential\npopulation for screening. When assessing the risk\nof developing lung cancer in a workforce,\nconsideration needs to be given to the size of the\nworkforce (at one site or in a specific group of\nindustries) and to the change in exposure pattern\nover time, bearing in mind the latency of\ndevelopment of lung cancer and changes in work\nprocesses aimed at reducing specific exposures.\nFor instance, while arsenic is recognised as a lung\ncarcinogen, very few workers in the UK are now\noccupationally exposed and exposure levels in\nthose exposed are very low. Consequently, current\nrisk to those workers is essentially that of the\nnormal population. In at-risk workers who are\nolder and who experienced worse working\nconditions early in their working lives, risk will be\nhigher whatever the current exposure. The\nworkforce most exposed to asbestos is now ageing\nand often no longer in the employment of the\nindustry that resulted in their exposure. As a result\nthere are substantial logistical difficulties\nassociated with trying to identify at-risk\noccupational groups for the purposes of a\nscreening programme.\nThe increased risk of lung cancer associated with\ncertain occupations and exposures, particularly\nasbestos, may warrant consideration of the\nfeasibility of a screening programme for workers\nor ex-workers. A case would have to be made on\nan occupation-by-occupation basis, with evidence\nnot only of their risk of lung cancer, but also of\nthe feasibility of running an effective screening\nprogramme in that population.\nDespite reductions in smoking and a fall in the\nincidence of lung cancer, at least among males,\nlung cancer remains a serious public health issue,\naffecting large numbers of people and with a bleak\nprognosis when presenting after symptoms\ndevelop. Treatment of stage I and II disease with\nsurgical resection has been shown to reduce\nmortality substantially. Screening for lung cancer\nis an attractive proposal, particularly since\nsymptomatic disease is strongly associated with\nmore advanced and inoperable cancer.\nCurrent service provision\nThere is no screening service for lung cancer in\nthe UK. The NSC reviewed the topic in March\n2004 and concluded that the policy not to offer\nscreening should continue.\nImaging technology for lung\ncancer screening\nThe chest radiograph (chest X-ray) remains the\nmost commonly used imaging technique in the\ninvestigation of respiratory disease, but it is not a\nsensitive test for pulmonary nodules, with an\nestimated 50% of nodules measuring 6\u201310 mm\nbeing missed owing to superimposition of the\nchest wall, heart and mediastinal structures.11\nThe past 30 years have brought revolutionary\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n5\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

During\neach rotation of the ring, the X-ray tube produced\na narrow beam of X-rays that passed through the\npatient to the row of detectors, acquiring a single\naxial image with a slice thickness of 1 cm. The\ntable then moved the patient a set distance\nthrough the system, acquiring the next axial\nimage. A physical link was required between the \nX-ray tube and a power supply and after each\nrotation the ring had to stop and rotate in the\nopposite direction. The first generation of CT\nsystems was of limited value in the investigation of\nchest disease, as total examination times were long\nand the images were prone to artefact due to\nmovement with respiration. In addition, small\nlesions could be missed if they were present\nbetween the thick axial slices.12\nThe incorporation of slip-ring technology into\nscanners in the late 1980s resulted in the\ndevelopment of spiral (helical) systems. The slip\nring is an electromechanical device that allows the\ntransmission of power and electrical signals from a\nstationary to a rotating structure. This allowed the\nX-ray tube to rotate continuously, while the table\ncarrying the patient advanced. Data could be\nacquired rapidly with slices as thin as 1 mm and\nwith image acquisition times as short as one\nbreath-hold of 15\u201320 seconds.\nFurther advances with multiple rows of detectors\nhave led to multislice CT. These systems have four\nto 64 detector rows that acquire multiple image\nslices during each rotation of the X-ray tube.\nImage acquisition times are, therefore, faster with\nless movement artefact as a result.12 The type of\nsystem being used in studies for CT screening for\nlung cancer is generally spiral CT, but multislice\nCT systems could also be used.\nThe advances in CT mean greater sensitivity than\nplain chest X-ray in the detection of pulmonary\nnodules. CT has the potential to detect pulmonary\nnodules as small as 1\u20132 mm owing to the high\ncontrast between nodules and aerated lung. A study\nassessing the sensitivity of spiral CT for pulmonary\nnodules, using surgical exploration and histological\nanalysis as the gold standard, showed the sensitivity\nof spiral CT to be much higher than previous\nreports of standard sequential CT with a sensitivity\nof 100% for intrapulmonary nodules larger than\n10 mm, 95% in nodules larger than 5 mm and 66%\nin nodules less than or equal to 5 mm.11\nHowever, the newer generation scanners are\nexpensive, with greater capital costs and increased\nrunning and maintenance costs for replacement\ncomponents. Sophisticated data storage and\nmanagement systems are required and, because of\nthe volume of data produced, there are increased\ninterpretation and reporting times. In the UK in\n2002, a typical spiral scanner could be expect to\nhave one tube replaced per year, at a cost of\naround \u00a325,000.\nIn screening, the balance between image quality\nand radiation dose is particularly important and\nevery effort should be made to minimise the\nradiation dose. There are differences between\ncountries in how CT parameters are set, and\ndifferent countries have different priorities in this\nbalance between image quality and safety. It has\nbeen estimated that the lifetime risk of developing\ncancer attributable to all diagnostic X-rays is\n0.6\u20131.8%. In the UK this equates to up to 700\ncancers per year.13 It is imperative to obtain a\nradiological diagnosis with the lowest radiation\ndose that is reasonably achievable (the ALARA\nprinciple).14 Compared to chest X-ray, CT results\nin exposure to higher radiation doses. At present,\nthe National Radiation Protection Board states\nthat the average effective dose from a standard-\ndose spiral CT of the thorax is 8 millisieverts\n(mSv), whereas chest X-ray is around 0.1 mSv and\nmammography 0.4 mSv. The average background\nradiation dose in the UK is 2.2 mSv. The risk of a\nfatal cancer of any type is estimated to be 1 in\n2500 for standard-dose CT of the thorax.15 CT of\nthe thorax imparts the highest radiation dose to\nthe lungs and breast tissue and as a result the\nradiation dose is higher in women.\nTo minimise the radiation dose, low-dose\nschedules have been developed. It is possible to\nreduce the dose by decreasing the tube current\nfrom the standard 140\u2013400 mA to 20\u2013140 mA.\nThe resulting effective radiation dose equivalent is\nmuch lower, 0.3\u20130.6 mSv.16 Studies comparing\nspiral CT of the thorax obtained at standard tube\ncurrent with those obtained at reduced tube\ncurrent showed no reduction in the detection of\npulmonary nodules in patients with known or\nsuspected pulmonary nodules.11,17 Most studies of\nCT screening for lung cancer incorporate the use\nof low-dose spiral CT regimens.\nTherefore, CT technology now affords us with a\nmechanism to image the thorax rapidly and with\nBackground\n6substantially more detail than using chest X-ray.\nHowever, these advances come at an increased cost\nand radiation dose.\nCT-detected abnormalities\nAs discussed already, CT can detect very small\nabnormalities within the lung fields. Discrete\npulmonary nodules are the most commonly\nreported abnormality that may be suggestive of\nmalignancy, but abnormal scarring and ground-\nglass opacities are also recognised as potentially\nmalignant changes. Unfortunately, CT\nabnormalities are not specific for malignancy and\nsome series report more than 90% of CT nodules\nto be benign.18 Radiologists report a number of\nfeatures that assist in differentiating between\nbenign and malignant lesions. Demonstration of\nfat within the nodule is a reliable feature of benign\nlesions, but is rarely seen. Benign patterns of\ncalcification support the diagnosis of non-\nmalignant lesions such as hamartomas and\ngranulomas (associated with tuberculosis,\nhistoplasmosis and other granulomatous diseases),\nbut the evidence base is limited.1 Nodules\nsuspicious of malignancy are often referred to as\nnon-calcified nodules (NCNs) in the screening\nliterature. The term NCN refers to the fact that\nthe nodule cannot be excluded from being\nmalignant based on the pattern of\ncalcification.11,19\nSize is also important in determining the\nlikelihood that an NCN is malignant, and large\nlesions are more likely to be malignant than small\nlesions. Analysis from one of the CT screening\nstudies reports that, of 378 positive baseline\nscreening CTs identifying NCNs of less than\n5 mm, none proved to be malignant on further\ninvestigation. In contrast, 3.3% of those 5\u20139 mm\nand more than 50% of those greater than 9 mm\nwere malignant.18\nScreening programme\nrequirements\nScreening is not simply about the technology used,\nbut the whole programme, including call and\nrecall of the screening target population using\nprimary care records to identify smokers,\ninvestigation of the positive screenees and all\nassociated services. In terms of equipment and\nstaff, access to a spiral CT and experienced CT\npersonnel is essential, along with specialist\nradiologists to interpret the images. CT systems\nare generally available across the NHS\n(approximately seven per million population).20\nA current investment programme aims to replace\nall CT systems over 11 years old in the next\n3 years. Despite recent investment, most are\nalready heavily committed to a service workload.\nIn addition, staffing in the existing radiology\nservice, in particular with radiologists and\nradiographers, is already stretched. For some\nregions of the UK, distance to travel to a CT\nsystem is long and access may be an important\nissue in promoting screening uptake. Mobile\nscreening units have been described and could\npotentially improve access.21 Support services,\nincluding a mechanism to call and recall\nparticipants, personnel to counsel participants in\nmaking informed choices about screening, and the\nfacilities and staff to deliver the required follow-up\nin a timely fashion, are all crucial to the screening\nprogramme. Follow-up is complex and includes\ndetailed imaging plus, where necessary, interval\nCT examination for signs of growth. The principal\naim of follow-up is to minimise the number of\npeople being exposed to tissue biopsy and the\nassociated risks (10% of people undergoing\npercutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy require a\nchest drain and 0.04% die as a result of biopsy\ncomplications).1 The screening programme would\naim to identify more people who could be offered\nsurgical resection. The effect would be to increase\ndemand on surgical services, but potentially to\nreduce the number requiring radiotherapy or\nchemotherapy.4 Screening will also identify cancers\nat an advanced stage and non-surgical oncology\nservices will be necessary to deliver the care these\nindividuals need.\nThe attitudes of the public towards screening will\nbe important in ensuring good participation in\nany screening programme and adherence to a\nscreening protocol. The authors are not aware of\nany published studies evaluating patient attitudes\nto lung cancer screening in the UK. A small survey\n(62 participants) conducted by the Roy Castle\nLung Cancer Foundation asked delegates at a\nconference (delegates were largely patients with\nlung cancer and their relatives) about their views\non screening: 92% responded that the UK should\ntake part in a study of CT screening for lung\ncancer. When offered the option to abandon\nfurther research into screening and just start a\nscreening programme, 87% responded \u2018yes\u2019\n(Baird J, Director of Patient Care, Roy Castle Lung\nFoundation: personal communication; 18 March\n2005). In the USA, a survey of 172 smokers and\nformer smokers found that 62% expressed an\ninterest in CT screening for lung cancer.22 There\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n7\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006. All rights reserved.has also been substantial demand for whole-body\nCT screening in the USA.\nOther current issues\nScreening for lung cancer has been the subject of\ndebate for the past three decades. Several\nsystematic reviews of screening for lung cancer\nusing chest X-ray, alone or in combination with\nsputum, have concluded that there is insufficient\nevidence of benefit in terms of reduction in\ndisease-specific mortality.23\u201325 However, there has\nbeen much criticism in the literature of both the\nmethods and interpretation of these studies.\nFirst, several of the studies did not use placebo as\nthe comparator and instead compared intensive\nscreening with less frequent screening, or chest \nX-ray alone with chest X-ray plus sputum. These\nstudies could not, therefore, assess whether\nscreening was better than no screening. Second,\nthe studies, despite consistently demonstrating\nimproved survival, did not demonstrate\nimprovements in disease-specific or total mortality.\nWithout evidence that overall mortality is reduced,\nimprovements in survival time may be subject to\nthree types of bias: over-diagnosis, length bias and\nlead-time bias. \n  over-diagnosis bias: small, slow-growing lesions\nare detected by screening for intervention that\nwould never become symptomatic within a\npatient\u2019s lifetime in the absence of screening\n  length bias: screening introduces a bias in\nrelation to expected survival by detecting more\npatients with less aggressive disease (who have\nlonger survival) and fewer of those with more\naggressive disease, because the duration of\nasymptomatic disease is longer in less\naggressive tumours.\n  lead-time bias: screening-detected patients are\naccorded extended survival times solely because\ncancer was detected earlier owing to screening,\nalthough death occurred at the same time as\nwould have happened without screening (i.e.\nthe intervention yields no benefit).\nConclusion\nCT is more sensitive than chest X-ray in detecting\nsmall pulmonary nodules but that raises additional\nissues for a screening programme in terms of both\nthe clinical significance of these very small\nabnormalities and the potentially large number of\nfalse-positive screening CT examinations.\nInvestigation, therefore, becomes a trade-off\nbetween the probability of the nodule being\nmalignant and the risks associated with further\ninvestigation. Diagnostic tests are not without\nhazards and the challenge of obtaining tissue\ndiagnosis is greater in very small nodules. There\nhas been no consensus to date about how best to\nmanage these small, screening-detected nodules.\nGiven the lack of evidence of effectiveness for\nscreening with chest X-ray, this review will only\nconsider the effectiveness of CT screening in\ncomparison to current practice; that is, no\nscreening programme.\nThe main issues when considering screening for\nlung cancer using CT therefore include:\n  Should there be screening with CT for lung\ncancer at all? Does it meet the UK NSC criteria\nfor a screening test?\n  If there is screening, should it be universal or\nselective? \n  Which CT schedule should be used as a\nscreening test?\n  Which CT screening protocol should be used?\nWithin a screening programme, the frequency\nof screening, call and recall processes, and\nmanagement of those who test positive will all\nbe important in determining clinical and cost-\neffectiveness.\n  What cut-off should be used for defining a\npositive screening test? Small lung nodules are\nnot an infrequent finding on CT, and not all are\nmalignant. There is debate about how to best\ninvestigate and manage people with such\nfindings.\n  What is the gold-standard test if someone\nscreens positive? A tissue diagnosis plus\nimaging is generally required to diagnose and\nstage lung cancer. Biopsy has associated risks,\nand there has been debate about the option to\nfollow up small nodules with imaging to\ndetermine growth rate before committing to\nbiopsy.\n  What are the consequences if screening is\npositive for lung cancer but at an inoperable\nstage? \n  Is universal or targeted screening for lung\ncancer cost-effective?\nBackground\n8Methods of the literature review\nLiterature search\nPreliminary searches showed that very few\nrandomised controlled trials (RCTs) had been\nconducted to evaluate screening for lung cancer\nusing CT. The search was not, therefore, restricted\nby study design. All primary studies evaluating CT\nscreening for lung cancer were included.\nSystematic reviews were also sought and assessed\nfor quality. The conclusions of the systematic\nreviews are reported under a separate section in\nthe discussion. A sensitive search strategy\n(described in full in Appendices 2 and 3),\nincluding the keywords of lung cancer, CT\nexamination and mass screening, was constructed\nto search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane\nDatabase of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane\nCENTRAL Register of Controlled Clinical Trials,\nNHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED),\nHTA Database, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of\nEffectiveness (DARE), Bandolier, Health\nManagement Information Consortium, American\nSociety of Clinical Oncology, Research Findings\nRegister, National Horizon Scanning Centre,\nScience Citation Index, Web of Science\nProceedings and National Research Register. The\nregister of projects held by the International\nNetworks of Agencies for Health Technology\nAssessment (INAHTA) was also checked. For\ncompleteness, the search strategy was not\nrestricted by language; where reports in a\nlanguage other than English were identified, they\nwere noted but translations were not sought. The\nsearches were restricted to cover from 1994 to the\npresent and the search was last updated on \n5 January 2005 (unless otherwise stated in\nAppendix 3). The bibliographies of included\nstudies were also searched, but authors of included\nstudies were not contacted for further information.\nSelection of papers\nThe sensitive search identified a large number of\npotential titles. Each title and abstract was\nreviewed by two of the authors (CB and RDV) to\nassess the relevance to this review. Two categories\nof titles were included for data extraction: (1) for\ninclusion in the clinical effectiveness review and\n(2) for inclusion in the cost-effectiveness review.\nThe inclusion and exclusion criteria were:\n  screening for lung cancer was the principal\ntheme of the paper\n  primary research (RCT, cohort or case\u2013control,\neconomic analysis) or systematic review \n  CT screening compared with no screening (or, if\na study included a comparison group that were\nscreened using an alternative screening method,\nthen only data from the CT screening arm of\nthe study included).\nThere was no important disagreement between the\ntwo reviewers that was not resolved by discussion.\nStudies evaluating the use of methods for\nscreening for lung cancer other than CT were not\nincluded, nor were those that evaluated the use of\nCT for other conditions (e.g. whole-body\nscreening or screening for coronary artery\ncalcification). Studies evaluating the use of CT for\ndiagnostic or staging purposes in lung cancer were\nalso excluded.\nRelevant papers were retrieved and reviewed by\ntwo authors independently. Data extraction\nincluded details of the screening protocol, \nfollow-up, diagnosis and participants. Information\nwas sought about test characteristics, including\nsensitivity and specificity. The checklists and\nmethods described in Centre for Reviewers \nand Dissemination (CRD) Report 4 were used \nfor the quality assessment of studies.26 A summary\nof the data extraction for each included \nstudy is provided in Appendix 4. Papers meeting\nthe criteria for the review of cost-effectiveness\nstudies are dealt with separately in \nChapter 5.\nOutcomes of interest\nThis review was not simply interested in the\neffectiveness of CT in detecting lung cancer, but in\nthe effectiveness in the context of a mass\npopulation-screening programme. The principal\noutcome of interest, as discussed in Chapter 2, was\nthe effect of the screening programme on disease-\nspecific mortality (i.e. lung cancer mortality) and\non total mortality. While studies with no\ncomparator group could provide information\nabout the screening process, the natural history of\nthe detected nodules and survival, only RCTs\ncould provide information about the effect of\nscreening on mortality.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n9\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006. All rights reserved.\nChapter 3\nEvidence of clinical effectivenessAn improvement in disease-specific mortality\nrequires not only that CT examination is \neffective, but also that the entire screening\nprogramme and management of those with\npositive screening tests is effective. In a population\nat increased risk of mortality from other causes\n(i.e. smoking and cardiovascular disease), total\nmortality is more important in judging\neffectiveness of screening.\nAdditional outcomes of interest in assessing the\neffectiveness of CT screening programmes \nwere:\n  What proportion of people were found to \nhave abnormal CT examinations at \nscreening?\n  What proportion of those people had lung\ncancer?\n  What proportion were stage I and resectable\ntumours?\n  What was the survival among those with lung\ncancer detected by screening?\nOutcomes were also sought that are likely to have\na service impact; that is follow-up requirements,\nquality of life issues and adverse events.\nSummary of included studies\nIncluded studies\nA total of 12 studies of CT screening for lung\ncancer was identified for inclusion in the review of\nclinical effectiveness. Several of these studies have\nbeen described in multiple publications. Table 2\nsummarises the 12 studies, indicating the main\nreference used for each study and any additional\npublications. Two RCTs were identified, but one of\nthese used a comparator group that received chest\nX-ray screening.27,28 Therefore, only the\nexperience from the CT-screened arm was\nincluded in the main analysis. A further nine\nstudies without comparator groups were reported\nin the review of clinical effectiveness. In addition,\none study describing a comparator group initially,\nbut then failing to report details of this group any\nfurther, was included for the CT intervention arm\ndetails.29 In all ten of these studies, participants\nwho agreed to take part in the study all received\nCT screening and were followed up over time to\nassess outcomes. The limitation of this design is\ndiscussed in Chapter 2 (section \u2018Other current\nissues\u2019, p. 8).\nTwo components of the screening programmes \nare reported throughout this section: \nbaseline screening and incidence screening. These\ntwo terms are defined below.\nBaseline screening, sometimes also referred to as\nprevalence screening, describes the first time a\npopulation is screened for lung cancer. In this\nsituation, there will be a mixture of people with\ntumours that have begun to grow recently and\ntumours that have been developing for some time\nbut have not yet caused symptoms. In addition,\nthis may be the first time that the lungs have been\nimaged in an individual and, therefore,\nradiologists have nothing for comparison when\ninterpreting the CT examination, with the effect of\nmaking it more difficult to determine the\nmalignant potential of the NCN. Change in a\nlesion is a strong marker of malignant potential.1\nIncidence screening refers to all subsequent CT\nexaminations conducted at a known time interval.\nNew or altered NCNs will be reported. Any\ndetected tumours will have developed since the\nprevious CT examination (i.e. new disease) and\nwill, in theory, either be at an early stage or, if at\nan advanced stage, then will be aggressive, fast\ngrowing tumours. In having at least one previous\nCT examination for comparison, radiologists are\noften able to exclude an abnormality as\nrepresenting possible malignancy on the basis of\nno change in size during the intervening period.\nUnfortunately, there were no data from the UK. In\ntotal, 25,749 people have participated in baseline,\none-off CT screening and, in all, 54,342 CT\nexaminations for the purposes of screening for\nlung cancer have been reported. Five of the 12\nstudies were conducted in the USA and a further\nthree in Japan. The remaining four took place in\nGermany, Italy, Ireland and Finland (Table 2).\nAll the studies included involved CT screening\nwith five of the studies only reporting the findings\nafter one round of CT screening. In Kaneko,37\nparticipants also received a chest X-ray and\nsputum examination. Swensen46 included sputum\nexamination. ELCAP included a baseline chest X-\nray.33 Gohagan randomised participants to be\nscreened with chest X-ray or CT, but as chest X-ray\nhas not been demonstrated to be an effective\nscreening method for lung cancer the results of\nthis arm of the study are reported in the table only\nand the comparison is not discussed in detail.28\nSone reported identifying false-negative CT\nexaminations on the basis of sputum, but did not\ndetail in the methods whether sputum samples\nwere routinely obtained in all screened\nparticipants.29\nEvidence of clinical effectiveness\n10Health Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n11\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

all the studies clearly described their\ninclusion and exclusion criteria, they did not\nprovide an evidence base for why certain cut-offs\nwere selected. All studies based entry criteria for\nscreening on three participant characteristics: age,\nsmoking history and fitness for surgery. \nAge\nIt is known from cancer registries that the\nincidence of lung cancer increases with age, so it is\nof little surprise to find lower age restrictions on\nscreening. The youngest study participants were\n40 years old (Table 2). \nSmoking\nTwo of the studies in Japan included smokers and\nnon-smokers.29,51 The remaining studies restricted\ntheir screened populations to those with a history\nof at least 10 \u2018pack years\u2019 (i.e. an average of one\npack of 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years). \u2018Pack\nyears\u2019 are widely used to summarise smoking\nhistory, but have limitations including translating\nfrom other forms of tobacco use, interpreting\nintensity of smoking and considering threshold\nexposure levels. The two RCTs limited the study\npopulations to those who had a smoking history of\nmore than 30-pack years.27,28 Time since smoking\ncessation was incorporated into three of the\nstudies by restricting screening to those who were\nsmokers within the 10 years before\nrecruitment.28,46,52\nIn the studies, participants were interviewed about\nsmoking history after volunteering to participate.\nA screening programme in the UK could be\nmediated via GPs who could restrict invitation to\nthose patients with a recorded history of smoking.\nUntil recently, the recording of smoking data in\nprimary care computer records has been\nvariable.56 However, the new GP contract includes\nincentives to record smoking status in all patients\naged 15\u201375 years as well as additional contractual\nrequirements to record smoking status in people\nwith asthma, COPD, diabetes or cardiovascular\ndisease.57\nFitness for surgery\nMost studies reported some degree of assessment\nof fitness for surgery before proceeding to\nscreening. There are three principal reasons for\nthis: fitness to hold breath for the duration of the\nCT data acquisition, fitness for diagnostic\nprocedures and fitness for surgical resection.\nWhile radical radiotherapy is an option for those\nnot fit for surgical resection, adequate lung\nfunction is still a prerequisite for treatment. In\naddition, the survival gain from radical\nradiotherapy [including continuous\nhyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy\n(CHART)] is nowhere near as good as surgical\nresection in stage I or stage II tumours (17% \n5-year survival with radiotherapy versus 60\u201370%\nwith surgery).1\nNone of the studies reported the proportion of\npeople failing to meet the entry criteria based on\nfitness. Given the population at risk of lung\ncancer, co-morbidities may be significant, with\nother tumours, cardiovascular disease and COPD\nhaving the greatest impact on fitness for surgical\nresection. In a male population screened for\nabdominal aortic aneurysm in the north-west of\nScotland and similar to potential lung cancer\nscreenees in terms of age and smoking history,\nonly 0.6% (62\/9657) of the volunteers were\nconsidered not to be fit for elective surgical\naneurysm repair by the GPs at initial assessment.58\nHowever, fitness for aortic aneurysm repair may be\nvery different to fitness among smokers for\npneumonectomy. It is, therefore, difficult to\nanticipate what proportion of the potential\nscreening population in the UK would meet \nthe criteria for screening based on fitness for\nsurgery.\nSubgroup at high risk of lung cancer\nIn addition to the population criteria identified\nabove, a number of the studies included additional\nsubgroups identified by the researchers to be at a\npotentially increased risk of lung cancer. These\nincluded the following.\nCOPD\nCOPD is strongly associated with heavy smoking\nand, as a result, lung cancer. One RCT27 selected\nsome of its participants based on the presence of\nobstructive airways disease confirmed by\npulmonary function tests. Those with COPD were\nrequired to have sufficient lung capacity (and\nadequate general health) to undergo surgical\nresection, if required. In addition to having\nCOPD, this group was further defined to be at\nhigh risk of lung cancer by having atypical \nsputum cytology.\nOccupational exposure\nNumerous types of workplace exposure have \nbeen associated with an increased risk of lung\ncancer and were summarised in Chapter 2.\nWorkers exposed to asbestos, silica (especially\npatients with associated fibrosis), radiation and\nchrome (e.g. electroplaters, chemical workers)\nhave been reported as having double the risk of\nEvidence of clinical effectiveness\n14lung cancer compared with unexposed\npopulations. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon\n(PAH) exposure is high in coke-oven workers and\nthere are, historically, high relative risks\nassociated with asphalt workers and chimney\nsweeps (RR 17.5 and 16.2, respectively). These\nare important occupational risk factors for lung\ncancer in the UK setting. \nThe association between asbestos exposure and\nintrathoracic cancers has been recognised for\nmany years. The Health and Safety Executive\n(HSE) estimates that around 6000 occupational\ncancers (all forms) occur each year, of which \n3500 are due to asbestos (essentially all thoracic\nmalignancies). Of these asbestos-related\nmalignancies, in 2003, 1900 were mesotheliomas\nand most of the remaining 1600 were NSCLC.59\nOne study of CT screening included only workers\nwho had been exposed to asbestos.53 A further\nthree of the studies included a subgroup (2\u201314%\nof the total study population) within the study who\nhad a history of asbestos exposure.30,40,52 None of\nthese papers quantified the extent of asbestos\nexposure.\nThe only other study dealing with occupational\nexposure was by Miller and colleagues in the\nUSA.55 They report a screening programme in a\nworkforce employed in the nuclear fuel industry\nwith exposure to a number of risk factors\nincluding radiation, asbestos and beryllium. \nNo other occupational exposure groups were\nidentified that have participated in studies for CT\nscreening for lung cancer.\nThe screening process\nCT technology \nTen of the studies reported using some form of\nspiral CT system and two used mobile systems that\nwere not otherwise specified.21,29,55 Effective\nradiation dose was poorly reported, but two\nstudies estimated exposure to be 0.6 mSv for men\nand 1.1 mSv for women.40,50 All but one of the\nstudies reported using low-dose protocols and,\nwhere reported, the CT parameters included tube\nvoltages of 120\u2013140 kVp, tube currents of\n25\u201360 mA and pitch of 2:1. Huuskonen and \nco-author reported using standard dose CT with\ntube currents of 125\u2013200 mA.53 The duration of\nCT data acquisition was not well reported, but\nvaried between single and two breath-holds and \n15 to 40 seconds.\nDefinition of a positive screening CT\nFor the most part, the definition of a positively\nscreened image was based on the detection of an\nNCN (Table 3) In Diederich40 and Swensen,46 any\nimage with one or more nodules of any size was\ntreated as positive. Studies conducted by\nPastorino50 and Huuskonen53 also used these\ncriteria, but specified that any nodule must be\ngreater than 5 mm to be significant. The RCT\nconducted by Gohagan28 defined positive images\nas those with nodules greater than 3 mm in size\nand in addition included spiculated NCNs less\nthan or equal to 3 mm. Gohagan also included\nfocal ground-glass opacification and\nendobronchial lesions. Henschke,30 Garg27 and\nMacRedmond52 all specified that CT examinations\nwith one to six nodules of any size were classed as\npositives. The presence of more than six nodules\nwas considered to represent diffuse disease.\nFurther, MacRedmond also included ground-glass\nopacities and mediastinal masses. The study\nconducted by Nawa51 included images with fewer\nthan six nodules that were greater than 7 mm in\nsize as positive.\nTwo Japanese studies, Kaneko37 and Sone,29 used\na subjective rating system where radiologists\ndetermined the likelihood of cancer without\nspecifying what features of the CT examination\nmade cancer more likely. \nMiller55 did not specify the criteria used for\ndefining a positive examination. Those images\nthat were found to be indeterminate or suspicious\nwere said to be positive.\nFollow-up of positive screening\nexaminations\nMost studies used similar guidelines when\nfollowing up positive screening CT examinations:\nsmall nodules were followed up with imaging to\ndetect growth, and larger nodules and nodules\ndemonstrating growth were biopsied or resected.\nHenschke30 and MacRedmond,52 for example,\nfollowed up with high-resolution CT (HRCT) for\nnodules 5 mm or smaller, performed at 3-, 6-, 12-\nand 24-month intervals for growth. HRCT was\nrestricted to one or two slices to minimise\nradiation dose. For larger nodules immediate\nbiopsy was considered. Miller55 also followed up\npositive CT examinations by rescanning with an\nHRCT technique.\nGarg27 and Diederich40 used repeat low-dose \nCT (LDCT) screens to detect growth in small\nlesions. In Garg27 nodules larger than 10 mm \nwere further evaluated with contrast-enhanced \nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n15\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006. All rights reserved.CT, positron emission tomography (PET) and\/or\nbiopsy.\nPastorino50 followed up nodules 5 mm or larger\nwith HRCT and contrast enhancement in selected\ncases. Nodules 7 mm or larger on HRCT were\nthen followed by PET scans. Further, nodules were\nbiopsied if there was positive enhancement or a\npositive PET scan.\nQuality of included studies\nThere were three main issues of study quality that\nhad implications for the interpretation of results\nfor the UK setting (details given in data extraction\nsummaries, Appendix 4). First, none of the studies\nreported information about the representativeness\nof their samples. All samples were obtained on a\nvolunteer basis. It is difficult to interpret how well\nthese volunteers represented the general\npopulation to whom screening may be offered.\nSecond, the duration of follow-up was limited in\nmost studies, with few presenting data beyond 2\nyears. Given the outcomes of interest, survival and\ndisease-specific mortality, this short duration is a\nproblem. It was further complicated by the high\nattrition rates in the studies of longer duration,\nwhere compliance with the screening programme\nof annual CT scans appears to be poor. Finally, the\nEvidence of clinical effectiveness\n16\nTABLE 3 Definition of positive CT screening examinations\nStudy Definition Size No. of  Other features\nnodules\nGarg, 200227 NCN any 1\u20136 None\nGohagan, 200428 NCN >3 mm (any for Unspecified Ground-glass \nspiculated NCN) opacities +\nendobronchial\nlesions\nELCAP , 200130 NCN Any 1\u20136 Ground-glass\nopacities\nDiederich, 200440 NCN Any 1 or more None\nSwensen, 200346 NCN Any 1 or more None\nPastorino, 200350 NCN >5 mm 1 or more None\nNawa, 200251 NCN >7 mm 1 to 6 None\nMacRedmond, 200452 NCN any 1 to 6 Ground-glass\nopacities +\nmediastinal\nlesions\nMiller, 200455 Unspecified Any 1 or more None\nSone, 200129 (A) Examination unsatisfactory\n(B) Normal\n(C) Lung abnormality of little clinical \nimportance\n(D) Non-cancerous lung lesion\n(Ed) Non-cancerous but suspicious \nlung lesion\n(E) Suspicion of lung cancer\n(F) Small lung nodule (<3 mm in diameter)\n(Ed, E and F seem to be considered suspicious)\nKaneko, 200237 (A) Inadequate image Any 1 or more None\n(B) Normal\n(C) Scar lesion caused by a previous \ninflammatory episode\n(D) Benign tumour or an active inflammatory \ndisease\n(E) Suspected lung cancer\nHuuskonen, 200253 NCN >5 mm 1 or more Nonelack of comparator groups in most of the studies\nmeans that it was not possible to determine the\nimpact of screening on lung cancer and total\nmortality rates in comparison with no screening.\nOther general points about the quality of the\nstudies relate largely to the quality of reporting in\nthe papers. Many studies have reported annual\ninterim results. In one study in particular it was not\npossible to reconcile either the details of the\nparticipants (i.e. age of included participants) or\nthe number screened.29,44,45 Where this occurred,\nthe data extractors made a judgement as to which\nreport was the most complete and this was used. In\nseveral studies the reporting of withdrawals from\nthe screening programme was poor and similarly\nthe following of screen-positive patients through\ntheir follow-up was not always complete or accurate.\nThe details of the quality issues are provided in the\ndata extraction summaries in Appendix 4\nOutcomes of screening\nThe main outcomes of interest are summarised in\nTable 2 and in the data extraction summaries in\nAppendix 4.\nPositive CT examinations\nAs outlined above, the definition of a positive CT\nexamination has not been universally agreed. It is\nnot unsurprising, therefore, that there is some\nvariation in the rate of positive CT examinations.\nWhat is more surprising is the extent of the range,\nfrom 5.1%29 to 51%46, at baseline. Seven studies\nreport incidence CT examinations. The incidence\nrate for positive CT was substantially lower than\nbaseline (3\u201311.5%). From the 12 studies, 4146\npositive CT examinations were reported from\nbaseline screening and a further 1677 from\nincidence screening in the seven studies in which\nmore than one screening round had occurred.\nTwo of the three studies restricting the definition\nof positive to only those with NCNs greater than\nat least 5 mm in diameter50,51 reported baseline\nscreening to be positive in 5.9\u20137% of the\npopulation. In the third study,53 baseline positive\nreporting was high (18.4%). Sone,29 asking the\nradiologists to identify lesions suspicious of cancer\nor indeterminate, produced the lowest positive\nscreening results (5.1%), but Kaneko,37 using\nsimilar definitions, found 11.5% of baseline CT\nexaminations to be positive.\nCompared with chest X-ray, CT screening\nidentified more people with positive screening\nresults. The one RCT study28 comparing CT\nscreening with chest X-ray identified almost\ndouble the number of people with NCNs at\nbaseline by CT compared with chest X-ray (20.5%\nversus 9.8%). At baseline, ELCAP identified 23.3%\nof people as having positive CT examinations.\nChest X-rays in the same study participants only\ndetected NCNs in 6.8% (and more than half of\nthese were considered not to be nodules on CT).30\nIn Kaneko,37 CT and chest X-rays were carried out\nin each study participant and approximately ten\ntimes more nodules were detected by CT than by\nchest X-rays.\nInvestigations and follow-up\nManagement of positive screening CT varied by\nstudy, but generally involved either follow-up by\nfurther CT to observe for change in size, or if very\nsuspicious of cancer (because of size, other\nfeatures or growth) then biopsy was\nrecommended. In most of the studies the study\ncoordinators managed the screening part of the\nprogramme and recommendations for further\nclinical management of the results were made to\nthe attending physicians. Almost all of those with\npositive CT screening were recommended for\nfollow-up with at least one further CT. Not all\nrecommendations were followed, because of\nphysician or participant choice. Biopsies were\ncarried out in 3\u201327% of positive screenees. The\nstudies report only a small number of cases where\na biopsy was recommended but not carried out, or\nbiopsies were undertaken when not recommended\nby the study protocol. After an incidence CT,\n6\u201335% of positive screenees were biopsied. Table 2\nshows the range of biopsy rates obtained in the\nscreened population. Insufficient information was\nreported to identify what proportion had CT-\nguided biopsy or bronchoscopy with biopsy or\nbronchoalveolar lavage to obtain tissue for\ndiagnostic purposes. \nDetection of lung cancer\nPrevalence and incidence\nA total of 215 patients with lung cancers was\ndiagnosed as a result of 25,749 baseline screening\nCT examinations. The highest prevalence of lung\ncancer was reported in the five studies from the\nUSA (0.6\u20133.2%). Prevalence rates in the studies\nfrom Europe and Japan were generally lower\n(<1.0%), except for the German study with a\nreported prevalence of 2.1%.40 In the seven\nstudies with incidence data, a further 87 cancers\nwere identified. Incidence rates varied from\n0.07%51 to 1%.50 Five studies29,30,37,40,46 reported\nmore than 1 year of annual CT screening data, but\nin all the compliance with follow-up was poor\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n17\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006. All rights reserved.(Table 3). Between 1.8 and 32% of people with\npositive screening CT examinations went on to\nreceive a diagnosis of lung cancer confirmed, in\nmost, by histology. Among the four studies with\nthe lowest rates of positive screening CT\nexaminations,29,37,50,51 Pastorino had the highest\npositive predictive value for CT screening.50\nMost lung cancers detected by baseline screening\nwere NSCLC (206\/215, 96%). Adenocarcinoma was\nthe major histological type reported in nine of the\n12 studies (range 33\u201394%). At incidence screening,\nSCLC still accounted for a small proportion of the\ntotal (2\/87, 2.3%).\nThe numbers of interval cancers were reported in\nfour studies using annual screening protocols.\nReporting was not consistent, and the term\n\u2018interval cancer\u2019 included not only new lesions that\ndeveloped for the first time between CT\nexaminations, but also for tumours that were, in\nretrospect, visible on the previous screening CT\nexamination. The one study with CT examinations\ntwice per year did not report any interval\ntumours.37\nStage\nBetween 53 and 100% of prevalent tumours were\nidentified as stage I disease (with the exception of\nthe Huuskonen study,53 where only one of the five\ntumours identified was stage 1). For incidence\ntumours, 71\u2013100% (excluding Diederich, where\nonly three incidence tumours were detected40)\nwere reported to be stage I disease. Three studies\ndid not report stage adequately. Only three studies\nreported a higher percentage of stage I tumours at\nincidence scanning than at prevalence scanning,\nalthough detection of stage I disease was high in\nboth screening settings.27,52,55\nResectability\nWhere reported, the resectability of tumours found\nby screening was high, more than 80% in most\nstudies (Table 2). Not all participants agreed to\nsurgery. The resection rates reported in the\nscreening studies are substantially higher than\ncurrent clinical experience in the UK.4,60 The CT\nscreening studies did not clearly report what types\nof surgical resection were conducted. In the UK,\nthe current National Institute for Health and\nClinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines indicate\nthat, where possible, lobectomy is the surgical\nprocedure of choice when curative resection is the\nintention.1 There will be situations where this is\nnot feasible for clinical reasons and more limited\nresection may be appropriate. However, the NICE\nguidelines were not constructed to provide\nevidence for the best management of very small\nlung cancers detected by mass-population CT\nscreening, and the most effective surgical option\nfor such tumours is not known.\nQuality of life\nNone of the studies reported any data about\nquality of life in the screening participants. There\nwere data about the impact of a positive test result\n(or negative result) on quality of life. Similarly,\nthere were no data about the quality of life in\nthose undergoing further investigation or surgery.\nSeveral did note the high positive rate from the\ninitial screening CT and speculated on the impact\nthat this, along with the subsequent follow-up\nregimen, may have on screening participants in\nterms of anxiety pending definitive diagnosis.\nA subgroup of participants in the large Prostate,\nLung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening\nTrial (PLCO) in the USA, using chest X-ray to\nscreen for lung cancer, have completed health-\nrelated quality of life questionnaires [Short term\n12 (SF-12) plus cancer-specific distress questions]\nat baseline and during the first year of follow-up.\nThis study reports a significant increase in cancer-\nspecific anxiety in the short term among those\nwho receive abnormal screening results. Once\nabnormal tests were known to be false positives,\nanxiety fell back to that of the group with normal\nscreening results. Ongoing participation with the\nscreening programme was, however, influenced by\nprevious false-positive results (93.7% adherence\nversus 78.7%).61\nTest accuracy results\nOne of the difficulties in estimating test accuracy\nis the absence of a gold standard. Therefore, true\ncases of lung cancer were determined by tissue\nconfirmation at biopsy or surgery or, in a few\ncases, on the basis of detailed CT enhanced by\ncontrast medium (where tissue sample was not\npossible). Truly negative results could only be\ndetermined by the absence of presentation with\ndisease over a period of time (or at subsequent\nscreening). Interval tumours were reported in\nthree of the studies and some authors commented\non whether, in retrospect, these lesions had been\nvisible at screening but missed. This was not\ngenerally reported in detail. Only one study29\nreported sensitivity and specificity results for CT\nscreening. Where available data allowed, the\nsensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value\n(PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the\nscreening test were estimated (Table 4). Studies\nthat did not report follow-up of the screened\npopulation for at least 12 months were excluded\nEvidence of clinical effectiveness\n18Health Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n19\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

Where positive screening CT was\nbased on subjective radiologist assessment of risk\nof malignancy, the PPV tended to be slightly\nhigher (7\u201314% versus 2\u20135%).

Two studies reported\ndetecting positive baseline CT examinations when\nreviewing the previous annual CT (i.e. missed\nNCNs): Swensen found 25% of the first year\u2019s CT\nexaminations to be positive in retrospect,46 and\nDiederich found 5% to be positive in retrospect.40\nThe most rigorously reported review of annual CT\nexaminations was by Sone and colleagues.29 When\nreviewing the CT examinations of those with\ncancer, they identified a high proportion that\ncould, in retrospect, be seen in the baseline CT\nscreening. This appeared to relate to radiologist\nexperience and was not repeated in the subsequent\nyear\u2019s results. In the remaining studies, where it\nwas possible to make some estimate of false\nnegatives, the sensitivity was around 80\u201390%. CT\nscreening for lung cancer performed well in terms\nof specificity and a negative CT examination result\nwas highly predictive of no lung cancer. It should\nbe noted that not all interval tumours are evidence\nof false-negative screening CT, but may also\ninclude new disease that has truly developed in the\ninterval (i.e. is not visible in retrospect on the\nbaseline CT). In addition, some could be seen in\nretrospect on the original CT, but were correctly\nclassified as negative at that time because they were\nvery small (only an issue for the studies using a\nbottom cut-off for size). This was true of the\nPastorino study, where six tumours, identified in\nyear 2 CT examinations, were visible but very small\nin year 1; all were considered resectable and were\nstage IA disease at the year 2 CT examination.50\nSurvival\nThe information available regarding survival is\nsummarised in Table 2. Only one study37 reported\n5-year survival, with 76.2% of the people with\ncancer detected at baseline CT (n =14) surviving\nfor 5 years and 64.9% of the incident CT-detected\ncancers surviving for 5 years (n = 22). In ELCAP,\nafter 2 years of follow-up for tumours diagnosed at\nthe baseline screening CT, none had died\n(n = 27).30 Sone reports two deaths among the 50\npeople diagnosed and surgically treated in the\nfirst 2 years of their screening programme (follow-\nup period estimated to be approximately\n2\u20133 years, but not reported).29 In one of the\noccupation screening group studies, survival was\nparticularly poor, with no patients surviving for\nmore than 2 years (n =5).53 Follow-up in the\nremaining studies was short and the duration of\nindividuals\u2019 follow-up was not adequately reported\nin these studies to allow comment on survival.\nWithin the screened populations, death due to\nother causes, in particular cardiovascular disease,\nwas not infrequent. \nMortality rates\nNone of the studies reported total or disease-\nspecific mortality rates. In the most part, follow-up\nwas too short. Where several years of screening\nhad occurred, follow-up was limited to those still\nparticipating in the screening programme. The\ntwo randomised trials were effectively pilot studies\nand did not continue long enough to determine\neffect on mortality. None of the other studies had\ncomparator groups; therefore, change in disease-\nspecific mortality between those screened with CT\nand those not screened could not be assessed. \nOther outcomes\nImpact on smoking behaviour\nA small subgroup of 134 smokers at one of the\ncentres participating in the ELCAP was surveyed\nabout smoking attitudes and behaviour after\nbaseline CT screening.36 Quitting was associated\nwith younger age, perception of risk and fear of\ncancer, and having had an abnormal CT\nexamination. Long-term follow-up of smoking\nbehaviour was not available. Seventy-four per cent\nsaid that it increased their motivation to quit\nsmoking, and 23% reported having quit. A further\n26% reported a reduction in smoking.\nUnfortunately, the timing of the follow-up\ninterviews in relation to the CT examination was\nnot reported. Similarly, a subset of the Swensen\nstudy was randomised to different smoking\ncessation interventions in conjunction with CT\nscreening.47 Swensen and co-authors reported that\nhigher attempt rates of smoking cessation were\nachieved with the provision of Internet-based\nresources. The rates of cessation are similar to\nthose reported with other types of smoking\ncessation programmes such as nicotine\nreplacement. None of the studies reported\nwhether any participants felt \u2018exempt\u2019 after\nreceiving a normal CT examination and therefore\nEvidence of clinical effectiveness\n20felt a reduced interest or desire to give up\nsmoking. Positive CT examinations were associated\nwith a higher motivation to quit.36\nAt-risk subgroups\nAge\nThree of the studies29,37,40 presented results by age\nband, and separated baseline and incidence\nscreening (Table 5). Kaneko showed a gradient in\nboth positive screening CT examinations and lung\ncancers with increasing age.37 At incidence\nscreening, this trend was not as apparent.\nDiederich did not report a gradient with age, but\nincluded very small numbers of participants in the\nolder age bands.40 All were consistent in\nidentifying no cases of lung cancers in those aged\nless than 45 years. Similarly, in the studies with\nhigher minimum age restrictions, the proportion\nwith detected cancers tended to be higher.\nSmoking\nTwo of the Japanese studies29,51 included smokers\nand non-smokers in the screening programme.\nOnly one of these,29 however, reported results in\nsufficient detail to allow comparisons between\nsmokers and non-smokers. Of the 5483 screening\nparticipants, 54% were people who had never\nsmoked. Although 44% of the study population\nwere female, among the women less than 6%\nsmoked, whereas 93% of the men were smokers.\nThe proportion of people at baseline screening\nwith lung cancer who were never smokers was\n0.44%, similar to that of smokers (0.40%). In the\nnon-smokers, the lung cancer was statistically\nsignificantly more likely to be a well-differentiated\nadenocarcinoma (90% of tumours in non-smokers\nversus 48% in smokers).\nCOPD\nOf the 55 COPD participants with atypical sputum\nin the US study by Garg, 22 (40%) had NCNs on\nCT screening and underwent further\ninvestigation.27 In two patients NSCLCs were\ndiagnosed (3.6% of COPD participants).\nCompleted follow-up of those with smaller nodules\nhas not as yet been reported. In comparison, the\n37 smokers with no history of COPD had eight\n(22%) NCNs detected by CT with only one\nNSCLC on biopsy (2.7%). \nUnfortunately, there was no follow-up information\non the management or survival of those with\nCOPD and lung cancer. Survival among people\nwith COPD is generally reported to be poor, with\nage, continued smoking and forced expiratory\nvolume in 1 second (FEV1) being strong\npredictors.62 Screening for lung cancer may not\nachieve the same benefits because of mortality\nfrom other causes. Among those with moderate\nrespiratory failure and advanced airflow limitation\n[arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) 7.4\u20138.7 kPa and\nFEV1\/forced vital capacity (FVC)\npostbronchodilator <70%] 3-year survival has\nbeen reported to be around 66%.63\nAsbestos\nHuuskonen and co-authors reported a workforce-\nscreening programme for 602 participants with\nasbestos-related disease identified in an earlier\nstudy of asbestos-exposed workers in Finland.53 Of\nthe workers screened, 65 (11%) required follow-up\nof some sort after the screening CT and five were\nfound to have lung cancer (plus one who was\ndiagnosed late after symptoms and a false-\nnegative screening test) (1% lung cancer\nprevalence). Only one underwent resection and all\ndied within 21 months of diagnosis.\nMiller and colleagues also studied workforce\nscreening, but this time in a nuclear fuel industry\nworkforce in the USA.55 Thirty-two per cent of\nthese workers had positive CT examinations on\nscreening, but only 0.6% were diagnosed with lung\ncancer.\nThe low prevalence of cancer in the workforce\nscreening studies may reflect the age of the\nscreened population, restricted to working age.\nThe two studies do not report the age of the\nscreened population in any detail.

Only\nGohagan reported fully adverse events potentially\nassociated with investigation for positive screening\nCT.64 Six patients experienced adverse events (a\ntotal of eight complications: three pneumothorax,\ntwo infections\/fever requiring antibiotics, one\natelectasis, one stroke and one acute respiratory\nfailure). In addition, one person died 5 months\nafter screening, but this was not attributed to\nscreening. Kaneko reported two deaths in the\n6 months after surgery from infection in the\nabsence of tumour recurrence.38\nSurgical deaths and morbidity were not reported\nin these studies. NICE guidelines for lung cancer\nreport the mortality from all thoracic surgery with\ncurative intent for NSCLC to be 3.5% (range\n1\u20137.6%), with a further 30% experiencing\nmorbidity.1\nRadiation exposure\nNone of the studies provided information about\nthe risk of cancer induced by radiation exposure\nas a result of screening. The follow-up period was\ntoo short in most, if not all, of the studies. As none\nof the RCT studies reported more than\npreliminary findings, again no comment could be\nmade about incidence rates of tumours in those\nexposed to radiation versus those not exposed.\nThe International Commission on Radiological\nProtection predicts that CT examination with\nLDCT, using the type of regimens described in the\nscreening studies (~1 mSv estimated effective\nradiation dose), would induce five cancers per\n100,000 CT examinations.11 Additional radiological\nexposure occurs with each repeat annual CT and\nany additional imaging investigations.\nIncidental findings\nReporting of incidental findings (i.e. other than\nlung cancer) was variable and related to the\nspecified screening protocol. One study37\nrestricted the radiologists to only examining the\nlung fields for pathology, while the others allowed\nfull chest images.30,40 Two studies reported in\ndetail the findings other than NCNs. Fourteen per\ncent46 and 49.2%52 had findings other than NCNs\nthat merited further investigation. Swensen\nreported 17 other cancers, 35 adrenal masses and\n33 renal masses among the 817 screened\nindividuals.46 In MacRedmond, COPD (29%) and\ncoronary artery calcification (14.3%) were the most\ncommonly reported findings.52 Kaneko, who only\nreported other malignancies, identified 14\nadditional malignancies of the chest wall and\nmediastinum among the 7891 screening CT\nexaminations conducted.37 Garg reported one\npatient with metastatic laryngeal tumour and one\nwith multiple granulomatous disease.27\nService implications of screening\nAlthough a number of the studies recognised the\nsubstantial costs to the health service in terms of\nscreening per se and the follow-up of large\nnumbers of positive screening CT examinations,\nnone reported the costs beyond the cost of\nconducting the screening CT (including the\nexamination itself, staff and reporting costs). The\ncosts reported varied from US$50 to 200 per CT\nand tended to be lower in Japan than in the other\nstudy countries. No discussion of quality control\ncriteria or mechanisms, administration\nrequirements, or impact on oncology or surgical\nservices was reported.\nIn all of the studies with greater than 1 year of\nscreening experience, the number of participants\nin the screening programme fell dramatically with\neach successive year (Table 2). Only one study had\nreasonable participant retention,46 with less than\n5% loss after 2 years. At 2 years, ELCAP had lost\n65% of study participants.30 Diederich\nexperienced similar losses at 2 years (33%) and\nreported on only 24 people who had undergone \n5 years of annual screening.40 Losses included\npeople who had died, developed lung cancer and\nfailed to return for annual screening on time\n(although some may have been screened at\nintervals of greater than 1 year, but these were\nreported separately, or excluded, by most authors).\nSummary of other systematic\nreviews\nSeveral reviews of this topic have been published.\nTwenty-five reviews were identified from\nEvidence of clinical effectiveness\n22examining the titles and abstracts. Of these, three\nwere considered to be systematic reviews and are\nsummarised in Table 6. One only considered chest\nX-ray screening.65 The other two concluded, as\nhave the present authors, that while there is\nevidence of a higher detection rate than with chest\nX-ray and small, resectable lesions are found, it is\nnot yet possible to assess what effect this will have\non mortality.24,25\nSummary\nIn the absence of RCT evidence to examine the\nrelative effectiveness of CT screening on disease-\nspecific mortality and total mortality, other study\nevidence was considered. None of the 12 studies\nreported disease-specific or total mortality. Only\none study reported survival data. It is not,\ntherefore, possible at present to assess whether CT\nscreening for lung cancer is clinically effective.\nThere is evidence that CT detects a greater\nnumber of NCNs and other suspicious chest\nabnormalities than chest X-ray. There is also\nevidence that smaller NCNs are detected by CT\nthan by chest X-ray.\nSubstantial variation was seen between studies in\nterms of the proportion of screenees with positive\nCT examinations and the rate of cancer detected.\nThe difference in results is to some extent\nexplained by the different definitions of a positive\nCT examination. Despite this, where similar\ndefinitions were used, variation still existed. The\ndifference in rates of detection of lung cancer\nbetween studies highlights the need for caution in\ngeneralising findings from other countries to the\nUK setting.\nBaseline screening identified more stage I disease\nthan the literature reports for series of lung cancer\nin the absence of screening.

Resection rates were high, substantially\nhigher than the current UK resection rates of\nbelow 10%.4,60\nIs the increase in resection rates sufficient to imply\na reduction in disease-specific mortality? There is\nevidence from the studies that substantial numbers\nof participants in screening will die from other\ncauses, particularly cardiovascular disease.\nSimilarly, the Japanese studies including non-\nsmokers29,51 identified a rate of cancer similar\namong smokers and non-smokers. In the non-\nsmokers, the tumours identified were\npathologically well-differentiated adenocarcinomas\nor bronchoalveolar carcinomas and grew at a\nsubstantially slower rate than tumours in smokers,\nwith mean doubling times in excess of 800 days.43\nThe frequency of these tumours decreased in\nsubsequent screening rounds. This may support\nthe notion of baseline screening detecting a\nsubstantial number of slow-growing tumours. The\nnatural history of these well-differentiated small,\nscreening-detected cancers is not yet well\nunderstood. \nLarge numbers of positive CT examinations were\nreported, particularly at baseline screening. As a\nresult, a high proportion of screening participants\nunderwent further follow-up, either by further CT\nor even by biopsy. All studies reported some\nbiopsies conducted for what transpired to be\nbenign disease. The rate of biopsy for benign\ndisease varied with different follow-up protocols.\nIntensive follow-up with CT appears to reduce the\nnumber of biopsies. PET and CT enhanced by\nintravenous contrast medium enabled further\nclassification of risk to reduce biopsy rates.\nHowever, only one study reported the systematic\nuse of PET50 and identified a number of cases\nwhere the use of PET led to biopsy of benign\ndisease.\nAdverse event reporting was universally poor in\nthe studies. None of the studies explored the\npsychological or quality of life impact of the high\nfalse-positive rates of screening CT, in particular\nthe potentially long periods of uncertainty while\nfollow-up was undertaken. Only one study\nreported the adverse events associated with\ndiagnostic investigation. Surgical outcomes were\npoorly reported. None of the studies was of\nsufficient duration to assess the risk associated\nwith radiation exposure.\nIn conclusion, the current evidence base for CT\nscreening for lung cancer is insufficient to\ndemonstrate clinical effectiveness in terms of a\nreduction in mortality. The ongoing uncontrolled\nstudies may provide a better understanding of the\nnatural history of CT screening detected NCNs\nand lung cancer. To demonstrate a reduction in\nmortality, RCT evidence will be necessary.\nEvidence of clinical effectiveness\n24Lung cancer screening with CT\nThe aim of this chapter is to consider critically\npublished evidence relating to the relative cost-\neffectiveness of population screening programmes\nfor lung cancer using CT. The results of a\nsystematic review of the published literature\nfocusing on the identification of studies that\nconsider the cost-effectiveness of different\npopulation screening programmes are reported.\nSix studies are included in the review and are\nlimited to the comparison between low-dose\nhelical CT (screening) and usual care (no\nscreening). Their conclusions depend on whether\nit is accepted that screening for lung cancer in\nhigh-risk populations can lead to improved\nsurvival and a reduction in mortality. \nReview of economic literature\nThe aim of this section is to summarise published\ncost-effectiveness analyses of population lung\ncancer screening programmes. Two reviewers (CB\nand RDV) searched the literature as outlined in\nChapter 3 and Appendix 2 to identify relevant\ncost-effectiveness evidence. Two reviewers (ABol\nand CM) then independently assessed the studies\nto be included in the review. \nIdentification of studies\nTwo reviewers examined all the titles and abstracts\nof the 1041 articles identified by the electronic\nsearch, and 23 were considered potentially\nrelevant to the cost-effectiveness review. A search\nof the references cited in the included papers did\nnot identify any further articles for review. These\narticles were then assessed for inclusion in the\nreview using the criteria below.\n  inclusion criteria:\n\u2013 full economic evaluation\n\u2013 explicit synthesis of costs and outcomes in a\ncost-effectiveness ratio\n\u2013 CT (intervention)\n  exclusion criteria:\n\u2013 no attempt to synthesise costs and benefits\n\u2013 reports, letters, editorials, reviews,\ncommentaries or methodological papers\n\u2013 non-English language.\nData relating to economic study design, findings\nand quality were extracted by one reviewer and\nindependently checked for accuracy by a second\nreviewer. All details were extracted on pretested\ndata extraction forms. All of the studies were\nquality assessed using criteria updated from the\nchecklist developed by Drummond and\ncolleagues.66\nQuantity and quality of research\navailable\nOnly six of the studies assessed for inclusion met\nthe criteria and were considered further\nbelow.67\u201372 Seventeen studies were excluded from\nthe review for the following reasons: published in\nJapanese language (2); discussion papers only (3);\nreviews of previously published studies (4); letters\nto the editor (3); inappropriate comparators (3)\nand technology assessment reports (2). For further\ndetails, see Table 7. Several of the 17 excluded\npapers discuss the findings from the six studies\nincluded in the review.\nThe six studies included in the review were full\neconomic evaluations of population screening\nprogrammes for lung cancer using CT. Overall the\nquality of the published papers was difficult to\njudge for two reasons. First, reporting of the\neconomic and mathematical models used in these\nstudies was poor; this means that replication and\nverification by the reader is not possible, as the\ninner workings of the models are not disclosed.\nSecond, lack of clinical effectiveness data means\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 way to answer the research\nquestion of interest. As a result, it is difficult to\njudge which of the papers contained the most\nvalid assumptions or used the most appropriate\nanalytical methods.\nIn summary, all of the authors adequately\ndescribed the research question and\ncomprehensively described the relevant\ncomparators. However, few papers included full\nand explicit discussion of the identification,\nmeasurement and valuation of the range of costs\nand benefits included in the analyses. Economic\nand mathematical models were used in all of the\npapers to produce cost-effectiveness ratios.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n25\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006. All rights reserved.\nChapter 4\nEconomic literature review of CT screening for \nlung cancerUnfortunately, the majority of authors did not\nprovide sufficient details of structural assumptions,\ndefinitions of variables, parameter estimates or\nequations relating variables to one another to\npermit intelligent peer review to be undertaken.\nAppropriate use of discounting, sensitivity analysis\nand incremental analysis was conducted in all but\none study. Surprisingly, few of the authors\nincluded references to previously published cost-\neffectiveness results.\nClearly, the quality of the cost-effectiveness studies\nincluded in the review was less than satisfactory.\nSee Table 8 for details of study quality.\nCharacteristics of economic\npapers (Table 9)\nThe majority of the included economic evaluations\nwere incremental cost-effectiveness analyses and\nreported outcomes in terms of incremental cost\nper life-year gained. One study presented results\nin terms of both incremental cost per life-year\ngained and incremental cost per quality-adjusted\nlife-year (QALY) gained.71 One study reported\nonly incremental cost\u2013utility analysis results,69 and\none study67 reported only \u201ctotal cost for one life\nsaved\u201d and \u201ctotal cost per mean life expectancy of\na patient saved\u201d. One study was set in Japan67 and\nthe others were carried out in the USA. The\nfrequency of CT screening ranged from a one-off\nCT examination71 to an annual CT examination\nover a 20-year period.69 Correspondingly, patient\nfollow-up varied from a 12-month period72 to a\n40-year period.69 CT was an intervention in all of\nthe evaluations and no screening was a\ncomparator. The study population was not\nuniform across the studies. Four out of six\nstudies69\u201372 evaluated CT screening for lung\ncancer in a population of high-risk individuals.\nEconomic evaluation models (Table 10)\nAll of the papers were based on mathematical67 or\neconomic models. The economic models were\nprimarily decision-analytic models. The\nperspectives used in the models, and therefore in\nthe economic analyses, varied from study to study.\nOne study69 described its viewpoint as societal, yet\nfailed to estimate the costs of lost productivity and\ndisability associated with screening and included\ninformal care costs. The majority of authors\noutlined the major assumptions of their models.\nHowever, on closer inspection, much of the\nimportant detail was lacking.

Estimates of life\nexpectancy are integral to the calculation of the\ncost-effectiveness analysis, yet two studies67,69 did\nnot explicitly state what method was used in their\nanalyses. \nCost data and cost data sources \n(Table 11)\nAll of the studies explicitly reported the price year\nand the currency used, except for one67 which\nfailed to state the price year. Overall, for the\nmajority of studies, the costs should have been\ncomparable as the price years were within a 3-year\nband (1999\u20132001). The key categories of costs\nwere similar across the studies and can be divided\ninto screening costs and treatment costs. Some\nstudies were very inclusive and included the cost\nof managing non-cancer patients over the age of\n6570,71 and monitoring of indeterminate\nnodules.69 Examples of costs included in the\nstudies are presented in Tables 12 and 13. Most of\nthe studies relied on the published literature\n(including Medicare reimbursement rates) for\nsources of cost data. One study72 used registry data\nto identify newly diagnosed patients and then\nused the hospital finance database to allocate\ncosts. Individual patient costing was not reported\nby any of the authors. Four studies used a 3%\ndiscount rate and one study68 used a 7.5% rate.\nThe majority of the studies presented total and\nincremental costs. However, one study68 only\npresented screening and treatment costs per lung\ncancer detected. \nEconomic literature review of CT screening for lung cancer\n28\nTABLE 9 Characteristics of economic studies\nStudy Type of evaluation  Interventions  Study population Country Period of study\nand synthesis\nOkamoto, 200067 CEA; total cost for  Mass screening  Individuals aged  Japan 5 years\none life saved; total  (indirect chest X-ray  40\u201384 years\ncost for mean life  for all screened and \nexpectancy saved sputum cytology for \nhigh-risk individuals) in \n1983 and in 1993 and \nCT option\nMarshall, 200171 Incremental CEA;  Baseline scan with  Hypothetical cohort  USA 5 years\nincremental cost  spiral CT vs no  of 100,000 high-risk \nper LYG screening individuals \n(60\u201374 years)\nMarshall, 200170 Incremental CEA and  Annual scan for  Hypothetical cohort of  USA 5 years\nCUA; incremental  5 years with spiral  100,000 high-risk \ncost per life-year  CT vs no screening individuals (60\u201374 years)\nsaved and cost per \nQALY saved\nWisnivesky, 200372 Incremental CEA;  Single scan with spiral  High-risk individuals  USA Costs were \nincremental cost per  CT vs no screening (aged \u2265 60 years, at  restricted to\nlife-year saved least 10 patient-years  1 year; benefits \nand no other  unclear\nmalignancies)\nChirikos, 200268 Incremental CEA;  Five annual screens  Hypothetical cohort  USA 15 years\nincremental cost per  with spiral CT vs no  of screened and \nLYG; cost per cancer  screening unscreened patients \ncase detected (general population \n\u2265 45\u201374 years)\nMahadevia, 200369 Incremental CUA;  Annual screen  Hypothetical cohorts  USA 40 years\nincremental cost  (20 years) with spiral  of 100,000 current, \nper QALY gained CT vs no screening quitting and former \nheavy smokers \n(aged \u2265 60 years, \n55% male)\nCEA, cost-effectiveness analysis; CUA, cost\u2013utility analysis; QALY, quality-adjusted life-year.Health Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n29\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

Three studies70\u201372\nused data from ELCAP to estimate probabilities\nfor the screened population (e.g. distribution of\ntumours detected in screened population).\nMahadevia and colleagues69 used data from four\npreviously published cohort studies to derive\nweighted probabilities for the screened\npopulation. One study68 used data from a range of\npreviously published studies including ELCAP for\nthe screened population, whereas the remaining\nstudy67 does not state the source of probabilities\nfor any population. A list of probability data used\nin the studies can be found in Table 14. Where\nstated, estimates of life-years gained were taken\nfrom national survival rates for the US population.\nOnly two studies69,70 used quality of life data to\ndescribe the impact of lung cancer screening on\npatients and both studies used quality of life data\nfrom previously published sources. Only one\nstudy69 did not report outcomes in terms of life-\nyears saved, yet it reported absolute and relative\nreductions in deaths and cost per QALY gained.\nCost-effectiveness ratios (Table 15)\nThe ICERs varied considerably across all of the\npapers. Incremental life-years gained varied from\nUS$250072 to $90,02268 and incremental cost per\nQALY ranged from US$19,50070 to $2,322,700.69\nAll but one67 of the studies used extensive\nsensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of\nthe cost-effectiveness results. Specific variables that\nmay lead to higher cost-effectiveness ratios\nincluded low prevalence rate, reduced survival\n(e.g. introduction of 1-year lead-time bias),\nincreased cost of diagnostic tests, increase in the\nnumber of patients overdiagnosed and a less than\n100% adherence to the screening programme. Of\nthe six papers included in the review, four of the\nauthors concluded that screening for lung cancer\nwith CT could be a cost-effective approach. One\nauthor71 was more cautious and stated that\nalthough at the time of the study there was\ninsufficient evidence of costs and benefits, there\nwas the possibility that lung cancer screening with\nCT could be cost-effective. Finally, Mahadevia and\ncolleagues69 argued against the introduction of a\nmass-screening programme for lung cancer using\nCT. It could be argued that the studies varied too\nmuch to allow a valid comparison of their results.\nSummary of evidence\nFrom the literature review presented above, it was\nvery difficult to draw any conclusions on whether\nor not screening for lung cancer using CT,\ncompared with usual care, is a cost-effective\noption. All of the papers in the review approached\nthe research question from different starting\npoints. To illustrate, frequency of screening and\ndefinitions of high-risk groups varied across the\nstudies. None of the papers in the review was set\nin the UK, and this means that their relevance to\nthe NHS was somewhat limited. Given the paucity\nof UK data available, it was difficult to compare\npatterns of healthcare and possible differences in\ntumour behaviour between the UK and other\ncountries.\nMore importantly, there was wide variation in the\nmagnitude of the cost-effectiveness ratios. This\ndisparity in cost-effectiveness ratios was not\nsurprising as the authors described markedly\ndifferent logistical approaches to screening and\noften incorporated quite different assumptions\nabout survival and mortality. None of the\neconomic evaluations discussed the costs of setting\nup (e.g. recruitment costs) or administering (e.g.\npurchase of new diagnostic equipment) a\npopulation screening programme, and it was\nassumed that the costs and benefits reported were\nthose associated with a fully established\nprogramme. The actual size of the population to\nbe screened was not explored in any of the papers,\nnor was the impact on healthcare budgets\ndiscussed. In addition, none of the papers\nestimated the benefits, harms and significant costs\nof incidental diagnoses obtained through\nscreening. \nThere is currently a resurgence of interest in\nscreening for lung cancer.90 Previously, screening\nfor lung cancer focused on the use of radiography\nand sputum cytology analyses.73 However, none of\nthese studies was able to demonstrate a decrease\nin disease-specific mortality.87 Recently, there has\nbeen a worldwide call for the re-evaluation of\nscreening programmes for lung cancer. There are\nthree important reasons for this. First, it is argued\nthat these previous studies were flawed in both\nmethodology and interpretation.91 Second, new\ntechnologies have been developed that may\nimprove the effectiveness of screening for lung\ncancer,90 and third, there is increased public\ndemand for these technologies, particularly in the\nUSA, as a result of aggressive consumer\nadvertising.92\nLack of clinical evidence\nAdvising patients on the merits of lung cancer\nscreening is difficult given the current lack of\nevidence,93 both clinical and economic.

and colleagues,90 a successful screening\nprogramme must be able to offer patients effective\ntreatments that can reduce mortality. To date,\nthere is no published evidence to support the\nassumption that screening for lung cancer leads to\nreduced mortality rates. However, there is\nevidence to suggest that screening for lung cancer\ncan improve the stage distribution of tumours\nidentified.94 This means that more early-stage\ndisease can be detected. However, whether or not\na stage shift occurs90 and whether or not detecting\nlung cancer early alters the natural history of the\ndisease25 are very much subjects of intense debate.\nIn addition, the majority of peripherally located\ntumours are visible by CT, but the majority of\ncentrally located tumours are radiologically\noccult.95 The focus of screening programmes\ntherefore appears to be the detection of\nperipheral cancers, although detection of centrally\nlocated lung cancers is still important.96 The\nimplications of this for the screened and\nunscreened populations were not discussed in any\nof the included studies. \nStage distribution\nThe studies included in the literature review\nassumed that the improved stage distribution did\ntake place and there was an implicit assumption\nthat this translated into a mortality benefit.\nHowever, only Mahadevia and colleagues69\nexplicitly quantified the effect of varying this stage\nshift. Chirikos and colleagues68 simply mentioned\nthat the cost-effectiveness ratio was sensitive to the\nnumber of early-stage cancers detected.\nQuality of life\nOnly two of the included studies69,70 addressed\nquality of life issues and conducted cost\u2013utility\nanalyses. Both papers reported utility values from\na previously published paper.97 Neither of the\nstudies explicitly mentioned that these utility\nvalues were not elicited directly from patients\nsuffering from lung cancer, but were compiled for\ntwo hypothetical NSCLC patients. Consideration\nof quality of life issues in cancer studies is\nimportant; however, the methodological rigour\nwith which utilities are measured must be\nmaintained.98\nBias\nIt is reported that mortality is the true test of the\neffectiveness of screening for lung cancer,99 as\nchanges in mortality rates are unconfounded by\nbias. Survival rates are often reported in screening\nstudies and used in cost-effectiveness reports.\nHowever, survival rates are said to be subject to\nlead-time bias, length bias and over-diagnosis bias,\nas defined in Chapter 2 (p. 8).90 Whether or not\nthese biases are incorporated into the cost-\neffectiveness analysis, and the analytical methods\nchosen, can markedly affect the cost-effectiveness\nratios produced, as demonstrated by the results of\nthe included studies. If these biases are omitted\nfrom the analysis, then the survival (and mortality)\nbenefit may be overestimated and vice versa. The\nmethods used for dealing with bias in the included\nstudies were not transparent enough to allow\nverification by the reader.\nHarm must be included in the economic decision-\nmaking framework. Economic evaluation is often\nlabelled as a systematic and objective framework\nfor decision-making as it allows a full investigation\nof the costs and benefits of the healthcare\ntechnologies under scrutiny. Assessing the costs\nand benefits of population screening for lung\ncancer, therefore, requires careful consideration of\nthe harms associated with screening, including the\nmortality and morbidity associated with the\nverification of indeterminate or falsely positive\nnodules, radiological risk and reduced\nparticipation in future screening programmes.\nFalse positives\nOne of the major criticisms of screening\nprogrammes for lung cancer is the relatively high\nfalse-positive rate.77 Only Mahadevia and\ncolleagues69 reported the number of unnecessary\nbiopsies and surgeries associated with their\nscreening programme. The false-positive rate of\nscreening may be very high93 and this is possibly\none of the overwhelming arguments for not\nadopting a national screening programme \nin the UK. \nRadiological risk\nNo incorporation of radiological risk was\nperformed by any of the authors of the included\nstudies. This was an important omission as\nradiation exposure (including follow-up CT\nexaminations) may account for more deaths than\nlives saved by the screening programme.93 Indeed,\na recent report reveals that the radiation risks\npotentially associated with low-dose CT screening\nof adult smokers for lung cancer are substantial.100\nAdherence\nFinally, some argue that high-risk individuals who\nhave a negative screen may perceive this as\nreinforcing their belief that their lifestyle does not\nrequire modification and that this will lead to\nreduced participation in screening programmes in\nthe future. Linked to this is the explicit\nconsideration of adherence in screening\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n37\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006. All rights reserved.programmes. Often described as a combination of\ncompliance and persistence,101adherence is\nanother factor that can influence the size of the\ncost-effectiveness ratio and was not explained in\ndepth by any of the authors. \nGeneralisability\nThe generalisability of the results of the cost-\neffectiveness analyses included in this review must\nbe explored. From a clinical perspective, as\nMacRedmond and colleagues52 point out, it is very\ndifficult to transfer the results of screening\nprogrammes from one country to another. For\nexample, most of the included studies in the\nreview used prevalence data from the US ELCAP\nstudy; this study reports a prevalence of CT-\ndetected lung cancer of 2.7%.94 In contrast, a\nstudy set in Ireland52 found the prevalence of lung\ncancer detected in a population of asymptomatic\nhigh-risk smokers to be only 0.46%. \nIn terms of cost-effectiveness, the country of origin\nof the study is also very important. For example,\none country may have a very aggressive follow-up\npolicy after screening and this will be more\nexpensive than a less aggressive policy. Year of the\nstudy is also central to the cost-effectiveness\ndebate, especially where the technology of interest\nis rapidly evolving. All of the studies in the review\nwill therefore need to be updated and their results\nreconsidered in the near future.89\nFinally, each screening programme needs to be\nevaluated in terms of clinical and cost-effectiveness\non its own merits. Generalisability will be limited\nwhen even slightly different screening\nprogrammes are being compared. For example, it\nhas been suggested that patients should undergo\nindividual counselling from their GP before\nscreening for lung cancer to discuss possible\noutcomes.102 Whether or not these costs are\nincluded in or excluded from a cost-effectiveness\nanalysis would influence the size of the cost-\neffectiveness ratio.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, there are many issues that remain\nunresolved in the debate over the true cost-\neffectiveness of lung cancer screening\nprogrammes. Before any definitive screening\nrecommendations can be proposed, careful\nanalysis of current and ongoing CT studies must\nbe conducted; in addition, more complete and\ntransparent cost-effectiveness analyses are\nrequired.90 The introduction of a population-\nscreening programme should depend on\nconfirmation that screening for lung cancer using\nCT does lead to a reduction in mortality.\nEconomic literature review of CT screening for lung cancer\n38Introduction\nThe central concern of this chapter is to explore\nhow our current understanding and the corpus of\nreliable evidence might support a meaningful\neconomic evaluation of lung cancer screening.\nThrough assessment of the published economic\nstudies already described and the modelling\nmethods used, it has been concluded that it is not\ncurrently possible to perform a rigorous analysis\nthat could yield useful information to inform\ndecision-making in this important area of public\npolicy.\nThe principal factors leading to this conclusion\nare:\n  the lack of high-quality direct evidence of\nbenefit (i.e. extension of life)\n  the high risk of harm through large numbers of\nfalse-positive detections\n  the currently weak understanding of processes\ninvolved in the origin and development of\ncancerous lesions amenable to screening, which\nprevents modelling of screening interventions\nwith any confidence.\nThe following subsections describe and discuss\nvarious problems encountered in attempting to\nconstruct a mathematical and economic model of\nscreening for NSCLC to demonstrate why the\nauthors believe that attempting a full economic\nassessment is premature. An indication of the type\nof evidence that would be required to redress the\nperceived shortcomings is also given.\nLung cancer disease modelling\nThe economic evaluation of a screening\nprogramme for any disease or condition involves a\ncareful comparison of the anticipated health-\nrelated costs and outcomes associated with two or\nmore alternative possible \u2018futures\u2019, governed by the\npresence or absence of a defined screening\nprogramme. Regardless of the availability of high-\nquality RCT evidence of efficacy (but particularly\nwhen this is lacking), it is important to have a good\nunderstanding of how the disease originates,\ndevelops and progresses. Where such knowledge is\navailable, it is best represented in the form of a\nmathematical model that allows the impact of a\nscreening programme to be projected and\nquantified over extended periods (ideally the\nremaining lifetime of the individuals affected).\nHowever, the process of formulating such a model\nimposes a discipline on the researcher and exposes\ndeficiencies in both evidence and logic which, if\nnot rectified, render the whole exercise ineffectual.\nThe disease process\nIt is generally understood that any cancer\noriginates from a single anomalous cell that begins\nto grow and replicate in an uncontrolled manner.\nIn the early stages of growth (for solid tumours)\nthe colony of affected cells is localised within a\nsingle organ and is not detectable clinically or by\nimaging technologies. In the absence of active\nscreening (whether opportunistic or systematic)\nmost cases are not identified until patients present\nwith suggestive clinical symptoms. Current\nthinking assumes that tumours grow at an\nexponential rate, often measured in terms of a\n\u2018doubling time\u2019. However, it is not clear whether\nthis is a realistic reflection of the normal process of\ncell replication, or is merely a convenient mode of\ndescription.\nThe wide range of disease severity observed in\npatients with newly diagnosed lung cancer\nsuggests strongly that the development of\nsymptoms (and therefore the stage of disease\nprogression at which the cancer is normally\ndiagnosed) is related to, but not determined by,\ntumour size.\nThe present case is concerned solely with NSCLC\n(which constitutes around 83% of lung cancer\ncases), since early detection of NSCLC is\nassociated with better treatment outcomes from\nsurgical intervention, whereas the same is not true\nfor SCLC.103 However, the proposed screening\ntechnology only applies to cancers developing in\nthe areas of the lung distant from the bronchi\n(where tumours are largely undetectable by CT).\nThese generally appear as of any size from 1 mm\nto over 40 mm. Screening for such nodules is\nexpected to be effective by allowing them to be\nremoved surgically before they are able to grow\nand metastasise to adjoining or distant organs.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n39\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006. All rights reserved.\nChapter 5\nEconomic evaluation of lung cancer screeningA stylised representation of the natural\ndevelopment, progression and detection of\nNSCLC is shown in Figure 2. As a potentially\ncancerous nodule grows it moves along the scale of\ndisease staging (left to right), and in parallel the\nprobability of emergent symptoms resulting in\ndetection (p1\u2013p4) also increases. The balance of\nsymptomatic disease detection rates, subsequent\ndisease (i.e. stage) progression rates (q12\u2013q34) and\nstage-related mortality rates governs the relative\nproportions of diagnosed patients in the various\ndisease stages at any time after detection.\nHowever, in this schema only the stage-specific\nmortality rates are directly measurable, and\nhuman studies to obtain the missing transition\nrate information would be unethical, since this\nwould require treatment to be withheld from\npatients with known disease.\nIn addition, this conceptual model is based on\nassumptions that may be vulnerable to challenge.\nIn particular, it is assumed that malignant NCNs\nwill continue to develop steadily unless they are\nsurgically removed. Yet it may be the case that\nsome will stabilise, shrink or grow so slowly, if left\nin situ, that not all will develop into lethal lesions.\nThis suggests that a more complex model\nstructure would be needed, requiring additional\nparameter values to be estimated for which no\nevidence currently exists.\nPatient diversity and bias\nNSCLC is not a single disease, but a mixture of\nrelated types of cancer affecting different lung\ncells in a variety of ways. In addition, there is clear\nevidence of wide variations in the aggression of\nlesions affecting different patients, so that\ndoubling times for tumours have been reported of\nunder 80 days and more than 400 days.43 Under\nthe simple model of lung cancer development,\ndoubling time is necessarily a positive number of\ndays, and therefore its probability distribution is\nlikely to be heavily skewed. Non-homogeneity to\nthis degree calls into question the reliability of any\ndisease modelling based on simple average\nparameter values. It also gives rise to the three\ntypes of bias often associated with studies of\nscreening programmes and described in Chapter\n2 (p. 8): over-diagnosis, length bias and lead-time\nbias.\nA well-formulated disease progression model that\nfully reflected this essential lack of homogeneity\nwould be automatically free of these biases, and\nindeed could be used to estimate the magnitude of\nbias observable in clinical studies. However, none\nof the models so far published for economic\nevaluation of screening is of this type. Therefore,\nauthors have been obliged to introduce artificial\nadjustment factors in an attempt to correct for\nthese biases. Yet the absence of reliable evidence\nto support calibration of a disease progression\nEconomic evaluation of lung cancer screening\n40\nSize of nodule\nDiagnosed\nlung cancer\nStage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4\nDeath\np1 p2 Detection p3 p4\nq12 q23 q34\nFIGURE 2 Stylised representation of tumour growth, symptomatic detection and disease progression in an unscreened populationmodel applies equally to estimation of the three\ntypes of bias, and the literature includes\nconsiderable debate and controversy concerning\nthe importance of bias in relation to lung cancer\nscreening.99,104\u2013107\nStage shift and estimated survival\nAs noted in the review of clinical studies, there is\ncurrently no evidence that screening for lung\ncancer results in extended life expectancy in any\npopulation. Until such evidence is presented, the\nonly way that a case can be made for screening is\nthrough indirect inference, assuming that\nintermediate outcomes (cases detected) can be\nconverted with confidence into true outcome\ngains. Fundamental to all the published models is\nthe notion of \u2018stage shift\u2019, which is used as the\nprimary basis for estimating the expected gain in\naverage survival and life-years. Since screening\nstudies frequently show a preponderance of\npatients in the early stages of disease, compared\nwith patients identified clinically, it is assumed that\nthis alteration in the distribution of disease stage\ncan be converted directly into improved survival\nusing standard disease and treatment-specific\nregister statistics.\nAlthough plausible, this assumption is by no\nmeans free of suspicion. At a practical level, the\nsurvival estimates obtained from disease registers\nare invariably dominated by data from unscreened\nsymptomatic patients. The biases noted above\nvirtually guarantee that the prognosis of the latter\npatients at diagnosis is significantly different to\nthat of asymptomatic screening-detected patients,\neven if all other factors are similar. This problem\nhas been recognised by one author,69 who invoked\nthe idea of \u2018pseudo-stage shift\u2019 to moderate the\nsize of simple stage shift in a sensitivity analysis.\nSummary\nThe processes by which cancerous lesions arise,\ndevelop and progress into symptomatic lung\ncancer are not well understood or described.\nMissing information prevents design of a reliable\ndisease model for unscreened disease. Modelling\nthe effects of screening involves making further\nuncorroborated assumptions about disease\nprogression and screening efficacy.\nScreening and treatment protocol\nThe published studies of lung cancer screening\nand related economic evaluations have used a\nvariety of protocols for screening people for\ndisease, investigating suspicious screening results\nand treating detected disease. The screening\nprotocol that the present authors consider to be\nmost appropriate in the UK is shown in Figure 3,\nwhich can be compared to the equivalent patient\npathways for patients developing lung cancer in\nthe absence of screening (Figure 4). These\ndiagrams would form the basis for any future\ndetailed modelling. However, important choices\nmust be made before modelling and assessment in\na number of areas, as follows.\nSelection of screened population\nIt is generally recognised that any screening\nprogramme is most effective and cost-effective if\ntargeted on those individuals for whom there are\npre-existing risk factors present predisposing them\nto significantly higher risk of developing the\ndisease. This means identifying relevant high-risk\ndemographic subgroups (age, gender and\nethnicity), as well as those whose lifestyle or\noccupation involves exposure to carcinogenic agents\n(e.g. tobacco smoke, asbestos). Only in Japan has\nunselected screening for lung cancer in the adult\npopulation been introduced. Elsewhere, some\nprescreening selection process is undertaken,\ngenerally involving medical or related\nprofessionals assessing patient records or\nquestionnaires, or performing a clinical CT\nexamination. This has the effect of reducing the\nnumber of unproductive screens carried out, but\nalso of increasing administration costs per\nscreened person.\nA history of smoking is the most widely recognised\npredisposing factor for lung cancer, with risks\nincreasing for both intensity of smoking [up to a\nthree-fold difference between heavy smokers\n(>30 per day) and light smokers (<10 per day)]\nand duration of smoking.108 The latter shows the\nstrongest effect, with relative risks of 15 or more\nbetween lifelong smokers and non-smokers. In\ncombination, these factors may increase cancer\nrisks for smokers nearly 50-fold over non-smokers.\nSmoking cessation leads to a progressive reduction\nin lung cancer risks,7 but probably never to the\nlevel experienced by non-smokers. Certain\noccupational exposure appears to be associated\nwith increased risk of lung cancer, in particular\nasbestos exposure. Other co-morbidities may also\nbe implicated, especially COPD.\nIn planning a screening programme it is\nimportant to define the target population clearly\naccording to criteria easily implementable by those\ncharged with prescreening selection.

Smoking is the main risk factor for\nselecting patients. However, performance of the\nscreening programme is dependent on good local\nsystems for identifying the highest risk individuals,\nand pilot studies may be appropriate to confirm\nfeasibility.\nFrequency and timing of screening\nThe first screen offered to a population (usually\nreferred to as a \u2018baseline\u2019 screen) is of a different\ncharacter to subsequent repeat screens. A baseline\nscreen detects prevalent asymptomatic cases of\nlung cancer, some of which may have been present\nand potentially detectable for several years.\nFurther screens (called \u2018incidence\u2019 screens) are\ndesigned to detect new instances of lung cancer\nthat have arisen in the period since the last screen.\nThe yield from a baseline screen is bound to be\nconsiderably greater than that obtained with other\nscreens, leading to better effectiveness and cost-\neffectiveness results (assuming that true survival\nbenefit is established). The relationship between\nbaseline and interval screening yields is dependent\non all the unquantified disease parameters\nreferred to above, and is therefore difficult to\nestimate consistently. In the ELCAP study94 the\nrate of cancers detected at baseline was 2.7%,\nwhereas early results of repeat screening30\nsuggested a yield of 0.7%, i.e. a ratio of about 1:4.\nAlthough it cannot be assumed that this figure is\ngenerally valid, it may provide a useful basis for\nillustrating the consequences of the distinction\nbetween screen types.\nAnalysis of UK cancer incidence data combined\nwith life-table projections offers insights into the\nage at which screening should start and the\nfrequency of subsequent interval screens. Figure 5\nshows that the peak incidence rate of NSCLC in\nthe UK occurs at the age of 82 years for men and\n78 for women. However, when converted into\nannual numbers of new cases diagnosed (Figure 6),\nthe peak ages both occur at the age of 77 or\n78 years, although the volume of disease in\nwomen is only 65% of that experienced by men.\nThe potential for benefit from early detection and\ntreatment of NSCLC depends on the remaining\nexpected lifetime of individuals if they do not have\nlung cancer. Individuals who receive curative\nsurgery as a result of screening detection could\nexpect to gain a substantial proportion of those\nprojected years (assuming again genuine survival\nEconomic evaluation of lung cancer screening\n44\n100\n0\n200\n300\n400\n500\nN\nS\nC\nL\nC\n \ni\nn\nc\ni\nd\ne\nn\nc\ne\n \no\nf\n \nc\na\ns\ne\ns\n \np\ne\nr\n \n1\n0\n0\n,\n0\n0\n0\n \np\no\np\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90\nMales\nFemales\nAge at diagnosis (years)\nFIGURE 5 Age-specific UK incidence rates of NSCLC in 2000.

Although there will be a\nnumber of co-morbidities and other factors\nmoderating this effect, especially among smokers,\nit is instructive to use the notion of \u2018life-years at\nrisk\u2019 to explore questions of the age at which\nscreening should start and how many screens\nshould take place at what intervals.\nFigure 7 shows a similar pattern for life-years at\nrisk to Figure 6 (new cases), except that the peak\nage has moved to 68 or 69 years and the potential\nto benefit among women is now 76% of that of\nmen (owing to greater life expectancy of women).\nThis pattern is broadly proportionate to the gains\nthat may be expected from annual interval\nscreening about 1 year earlier.\nIf one wishes to consider the optimal timing of a\nsingle baseline screen without any subsequent\nrescreening, this effect can be approximated by\naccumulating the annual risk over several previous\nyears. Using the ELCAP result, and accumulating 4\nprevious years\u2019 incidence, it is found that the\ngreatest potential benefit occurs with a single screen\nat the age of 70 for both men and women\n(although any age between 66 and 74 ensures that\nat least 90% of the maximum benefit is achieved).30\nHowever, best economic results are likely when the\nlife-years gained per person screened are\nmaximised. Owing to the reducing number of\npeople in the population at older ages, the peak for\nthis measure occurs rather later, at 73 years of age.\nEquivalent results for other screening programme\ndesigns can be obtained by combining results from\nbaseline screens with (say) annual interval screens\nover several years. This has the effect of moving\nthe starting age forward; thus, following a baseline\nscreen with five annual interval screens advances\nthe starting age by 2\u20133 years. However, because\nthe yield for interval screens is lower than for the\nbaseline screen, and each additional screen\nincludes screening times more distant from the\noptimal-yield age, the incremental gain from each\nextension of the programme diminishes.\nThese results have been confirmed by repeating the\nanalysis substituting NSCLC mean survival times by\nstage, age and treatment derived from analysis of\nthe US SEER database for patients with NSCLC, in\nplace of UK life expectancy.109 The conclusions are\nvirtually identical, although it may be appropriate\nto vary the optimum ages by 1 years (or 2 years at\nmost) to allow for possible lead-time bias.\nSummary\nIf screening does lead to survival gains, then a\nsingle screen at about 70 years of age can be\nexpected to provide the greatest gain in life-years\nacross the population. However, the best cost-\neffectiveness of a single screen is likely at about\nthe age of 73. Adding further interval screens to a\nbaseline screen will incrementally increase overall\noutcome gains, but steadily erode the cost-\neffectiveness of the programme.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n45\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

A positive result involves\nthe identification of one to six NCNs suggestive of\npossible lung cancer and requiring confirmatory\ninvestigation. Patients with evident malignancy or\nlarge nodules are referred directly for biopsy.\nThose with diffuse disease (more than six NCNs,\ndiffuse bronchiectasis and\/or ground-glass\nopacities) are also referred for confirmation. Any\nnon-cancerous abnormalities are referred to the\nappropriate specialist for follow-up and treatment.\nConfirmation and diagnosis\nConfirmation of screening-positive or suspicious\nfindings is by HRCT as soon as possible after the\nscreening test. Any confirmed probable\nmalignancy is referred for biopsy for a definitive\nhistological diagnosis and staging. If HRCT\nclearly negates the initial screen suspicion, the\npatient is discharged and re-entered into any\nongoing future screens defined by the screening\nprogramme.\nFollow-up of suspicious screens\nFor any patient undergoing a confirmatory HRCT\nin whom suspicion remains, further HRCT\nexaminations are scheduled for 3, 12 and\n24 months to look for evidence of nodule growth\nsuggestive of malignancy. If growth is found at any\nstage, the patient is referred for biopsy; otherwise,\nthe patient is discharged to the normal screening\nschedule.\nTreatment and follow-up of detected\ndisease\nWhere biopsy fails to show any evidence of\nmalignancy the patient is discharged.

The techniques used are likely to vary with\nthe tumour location (central versus peripheral)\nand patient tolerance of the procedure. Little is\nalso known of current UK practice in terms of the\nvarious types of surgical intervention. The nature\nand cost of \u2018supportive care\u2019 in lung cancer are\nparticularly poorly researched. Although\nprofessional guidelines are of some interest, they\nmay be more indicative of future aspirations than\nof the current state of clinical practice, which\nshould be the baseline from which any decision is\nmade.\nEstimation of long-term survival\nIn the absence of direct evidence of survival gains,\nthe case for lung cancer screening depends on the\nassumption that stage shift at detection and the\nconsequent change in mode of intervention (i.e.\nincreased use of curative surgery) lead to a better\nprognosis for most patients. To quantify this effect\nin the context of an economic evaluation it is\nnecessary to use statistics derived from\nobservational databases. Unfortunately the values\nroutinely reported in clinical or epidemiological\njournals (median survival, survival at 1, 2 or\n5 years) do not correspond to the measure\nrequired for economic evaluation, the mean\nestimated survival time. In particular, unless the\nsurvival time distribution is symmetric, it is\nprobable that the median survival time will be a\nbiased and unreliable basis for estimating life\nexpectancy. \nA further problem arises when analysing data with\nincomplete follow-up: although Kaplan\u2013Meier\nestimation with censoring yields mean survival\nestimates, these often underestimate the true value\nof the population mean owing to the absence of\nsufficient data for extended follow-up. This\nproblem must be addressed by fitting parametric\nmodels to the available data as a basis for\nprojecting all patients forward to the time of their\nanticipated death. This procedure has been\napplied to individual patient data available in the\nSEER public-access database to derive mean\nsurvival times for each combination of age,\ngender, disease stage at diagnosis and principal\nmode of treatment (i.e. surgery or not surgery).\nThe estimated mean survival in each case (for \n5-year age bands) was calculated using the\nKaplan\u2013Meier technique, and then ordinary least\nsquares regression was used to fit a two-part model\ninvolving one population component subject to\nhigh mortality risk (simple exponential function\nbased on constant hazard), and a second\nsubpopulation exposed to lower risk and\nrepresented by a Weibull distribution. Comparing\ndifferences between the Kaplan\u2013Meier and\nparametric estimates (Figure 8) shows that for\nestimates up to about 6 years the two approaches\nyield very similar results, but beyond 6 years the\nparametric method produces larger values as\nexpected, and is therefore to be preferred.\nThe SEER database is very widely used by\npublished authors as the basis for survival\ncalculations, partly because it is probably unique\nin the size, range and quality of its data, and\npartly because it is US specific and most\nevaluations of lung cancer screening have been US\nbased.1 Unfortunately, there is no comparable data\nsource in the UK that would permit survival\nestimates to be generated that are consistent with\nUK case-mix profiles and treatment practices. In\nthe regional cancer registries staging information\nis only available for a minority of patients, so it\nwould be impossible to estimate the consequences\nof stage shift with any confidence. It is known\nfrom summary statistics that the proportion of UK\nlung cancer patients undergoing curative surgery\nhas been much lower than in the USA or\nEurope,60,110,111 so that there are strong reasons to\nbelieve that statistics derived from SEER will not\nbe transferable to a UK setting, since the case-mix\nof patients benefiting from any stage shift would\nbe quite different from those benefiting in the\nUSA.\nSummary\nEstimation of survival gains indirectly through\nassumptions about stage shift requires access to \nan appropriate and reliable source of data in the\nUK, but this is not currently available. Use of the\nSEER database for this purpose is subject to\nserious and unquantifiable bias and so cannot be\njustified.\nUtility values for lung cancer\nWhether survival gains are obtained directly from\nan RCT or indirectly through stage shift\nassumptions, it is necessary to convert these to\nQALYs when performing a cost\u2013utility analysis,\nusing a set of utility values obtained through a\nvalidated generic methodology. As noted in the\nprevious section, there is no mention in the\npublished economic evaluations of an evidence-\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n47\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006. All rights reserved.based source for utility values; all the referenced\nsources ultimately derive values from a crude\nhypothetical exercise in which no patient data\nwere used.97 However, a more recent Italian\nstudy112 collected quality of life and utility data\n(SF-36 and EuroQol) from 95 NSCLC patients in\n15 hospitals. The authors quote mean EuroQol\nvalues of 0.58 for lung cancer, and report univariate\nbinary variations for gender, age, time from\ndiagnosis, the presence of metastases and three\ntreatment modalities. Unfortunately, they did not\nreport any multivariate analysis to facilitate\nestimation of utility by stage of disease, which\nwould be required for evaluation of any benefits of\nlung cancer screening. Until comprehensive\npatient studies are carried out to estimate utilities\nfor all the relevant lung cancer patient states using\nan appropriate generic instrument, utilities have\nto be \u2018guessed\u2019 or inferred by parallels with other\npatient types. Under these circumstances any\ncost\u2013utility results will need to be subject to wide-\nranging sensitivity analysis, and may therefore fail\nto command great confidence.\nSummary\nThe lack of an evidence-based source for patient\nutilities means that any cost\u2013utility analysis of lung\ncancer screening is likely to be subject to\nsubstantial uncertainty.\nPotential for harm\nFalse-positive results\nThe false-positive rate of CT screening (i.e. the\ncomplement of the test specificity) has an\nimportant bearing both on the impact of\nscreening on the participating population and on\nthe costs associated with the programme. A meta-\nanalysis of test characteristics from published\nstudies69 shows a test sensitivity of 93% and\nspecificity of 83%. The relationship between the\nnumber of cases of lung cancer correctly\nidentified and the number of participants with a\ntest result suggestive of cancer depends on the\nunderlying prevalence of the disease in the\npopulation. For example, if the prevalence is\nsimilar to that experienced in the baseline ELCAP\nscreen (where cancer was confirmed in 2.7% of\nscreens), then one should expect 14\u201316 false-\npositive results for every case of lung cancer\nfound.30 However, if the prevalence was at the\nlevel reported in Ireland52 (0.46%), then each\ncase of lung cancer occurs alongside 83\u201393 false\npositives.\nThere are no definitive studies describing the\nimpact on screenees of a \u2018suspicious\u2019 result, but it\ncan be expected to involve considerable anxiety\nfor the individual and their family until further\nEconomic evaluation of lung cancer screening\n48\n\u20131.5\n\u20131.0\n\u20130.5\n0\n0.5\n1.0\n02468 1 0 1 2\nKaplan\u2013Meier mean survival (years)\nD\ni\nf\nf\ne\nr\ne\nn\nc\ne\n:\n \nK\na\np\nl\na\nn\n\u2013\nM\ne\ni\ne\nr\n \n\u2013\n \np\na\nr\na\nm\ne\nt\nr\ni\nc\n \nm\ne\na\nn\n \ns\nu\nr\nv\ni\nv\na\nl\nFIGURE 8 Comparison of Kaplan\u2013Meier and parametric mean survival estimates for age, gender and treatment subgroupsinvestigations provide full reassurance (which may\ntake as long as 1 or even 2 years, depending on\nthe protocol used), and this may represent an\nimportant (albeit limited) loss of quality of life and\npersonal utility. In addition, false-positive results\nwill lead to people affected undergoing several\nadditional HRCT examinations and perhaps extra\nlow-dose screening tests before doctors can be\nconfident that the patient is not suffering from a\nclinically important lesion. These procedures add\nsubstantially to the total cost of the screening\nprogramme.\nAdverse events\nFor a minority of false-positive detections, the\npatient may undergo invasive diagnostic procedures\nand even radical surgery for suspected malignancy,\nand these procedures all carry the risk of serious\nadverse events or even death. These risks, although\nsmall, may have importance to economic analysis,\nparticularly as a single premature death (and the\nlife-years lost thereby) may have a marked impact\non ICERs. In ELCAP,32 only one biopsy was taken\nfrom a patient with benign disease, and no patients\nhad other invasive surgery. By contrast, in Ireland,52\na total of eight procedures was carried out on seven\npatients with benign disease (1.6%). It appears that\nthe probability of unnecessary thoracic surgery\nvaries widely between locations, and hence the risk\nof serious adverse events leading to morbidity or\nmortality may be significant, but is difficult to\npredict.\nSummary\nA lung cancer screening programme is likely to\nproduce large numbers of suspicious cases that,\nafter further investigation, are found to be false\npositives. These will incur additional costs for\ndiagnostic tests, and may involve many people in\nperiods of unwarranted anxiety. Furthermore, a\nminority may undergo futile invasive procedures\nwith attendant risks of morbidity or mortality.\nRadiological exposure\nBrenner100 estimated the increased lifetime risk \nof lung cancer attributable to the additional\nradiation exposure involved in LDCT screening.\nHe concluded that a single CT examination\nwould result in a negligible extra risk, but that\nannual screening from the age of 50\u201375 is likely\nto increase the lifetime incidence of lung cancer\nby about 5% in women and about 1.5% in men.\nHe also remarks that delaying screening until \nthe age of 60 sharply reduces the excess risk \n(by about 80%), and offering screening twice \na year rather than annually cuts the extra risk \nby half.\nSummary\nA model used to evaluate and compare screening\nschemes using multiple interval screens should\ninclude a risk adjustment to reflect the increased\nincidence rates associated with cumulative\nradiological exposure.\nIncidental findings\nMacRedmond and colleagues52 highlighted the\nimportance of other morbidities identified in the\ncourse of screening for lung cancer: in the Irish\nstudy, incidental findings occurred in 61.5% of\npatients, leading to many referrals to specialists in\nrespiratory medicine, cardiology and\ngastroenterology. He reported that additional\nhealthcare costs were incurred for 49% of those\nscreened. It should not be any surprise to find\nsuch co-morbidities where individuals are selected\nfor screening on account of their risk-factor\nprofile, even if the large number of incidental\ncases reported may be exceptional. MacRedmond\nnotes that two-thirds of such disease was related to\ncigarette smoking.\nIt is a matter for debate whether these incidental\ndiscoveries contribute important additional health\nbenefits to the screening programme, or merely\nincrease anxiety for many people and their\nfamilies. What is not in dispute is that substantial\nadditional healthcare resources are required to\nrespond to these findings, some of which\nconstitute \u2018new money\u2019 and some are merely\nincurred somewhat earlier than would otherwise\nhave been the case.\nSummary\nThe selection of high-risk individuals for\ninvitation to screening increases the likelihood of\nincidental findings of treatable disease in many\npeople. The extra costs and (dis)benefits of\ntreating these conditions should be included in an\neconomic evaluation of lung cancer screening.\nParticipation\nThe level of response to an invitation for a first\nscreening test is important in restricting the\nquantity of prevalent disease that could be\ndetected, and is also important in assessing the\nviability of a screening programme. However, it\nshould not affect the cost-effectiveness of the\nprogramme greatly, unless response is biased in\nrelation to risk factors for lung cancer. By contrast,\nthe probability that individuals will drop out of\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n49\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006. All rights reserved.subsequent interval screens can adversely affect\nthe economic assessment of programmes based on\ncontinuing surveillance. The ELCAP experience of\nrepeat screening30 achieved a participation rate of\n84% in the first round of annual repeat screens,\nwhich increased to 88% after protocol exclusions.\nMahadevia and colleagues69 used 93.5% (a\nweighted average of ELCAP and another US study\nreported by Swensen49) for annual cumulative\nparticipation rate. Regardless of the value used,\nprogressive erosion of the screened population\nover several years can dramatically reduce the\nlikely yield of new detections in later years. After\n10 years of annual repeat screens with a 10%\nannual attrition rate, less than 35% of the original\ncohort will still be participating, and only about\n60% of the expected cancers will have been\ndetected. Since each extra year of screening\nreduces the cost-effectiveness of the overall\nprogramme, loss of participation can threaten the\neconomic case for multiyear screening. Experience\nin Japan,37,44 where population-wide screening has\na longer history, suggests that attrition rates may\nbe considerably higher outside a study setting.\nSummary\nParticipation rates in single-observation screening\nare important for the viability of a programme,\nbut should not normally threaten its cost-\neffectiveness. However, progressive loss of\nparticipation in a series of repeat screenings can\nimpact adversely on both viability and cost-\neffectiveness. Participation rates in studies \nmay overestimate what is achievable in more\nroutine use.\nCosts and resources\nThe ten main classes of healthcare resources and\ncosts required in a comprehensive economic\nevaluation of lung cancer screening are detailed in\nTable 16. None of the published economic studies\nencompasses all elements. There are important\ngaps in the availability of information applicable\nto a UK context, and new data would need to be\ncollected via clinical studies or surveys in at least\nsix areas. Cost models that are based on phases of\npatient experience have been developed for the\nUS health system,72,113,114 but cannot be used\ndirectly in the UK without recalibration to NHS-\nlinked individual patient data.\nSummary\nThere are serious shortcomings in the economic\ndata currently available in the UK concerning\ntreatment of lung cancer patients. New research is\nrequired to provide information needed for a\ncomprehensive economic assessment of lung\ncancer screening in the UK.\nConclusions\nThis chapter has considered several issues of\nimportance to researchers attempting an economic\nevaluation of screening for lung cancer using\nLDCT scanning. It has focused especially on the\nevidential and data requirements for constructing\na suitable disease, screening and treatment model\nfor such an evaluation. In the process, serious\ndeficiencies in the type and quality of information\nfrom UK sources were identified. One or two such\nproblems may sometimes be addressed through\ntargeted scenario analysis, but the broad range of\ndeficiencies in this instance renders such an\napproach infeasible.\nThe most severe problem is the lack of high-\nquality RCTs demonstrating directly that the\nscreening programme is effective in reducing\nmortality or morbidity. Claims to efficacy have to\nbe based on inference from intermediate\noutcomes, and the required logic, although\nconvincing to some, is vulnerable to challenge.\nThe weaknesses in this argument are directly\nrelated to gaps in our understanding of the early\nnatural history of NSCLC, concerning the growth\ndynamics of NCNs and their development into\nclinical lesions. These weaknesses become\napparent when attempting to structure and\npopulate a mathematical model.\nEfficacy is at the heart of any economic assessment\nof a health technology: if the evidence does not\nsupport health gains in either the quantity or\nquality of life, and there are net additional costs\nincurred (as is very likely with lung cancer\nscreening), then it is highly improbable that\nscreening can ever be shown to be cost-effective.\nConversely, if lung cancer screening can be shown\nto generate significant extension of life with only\nmodest additional cost per patient, then cost-\neffectiveness will very probably be demonstrable in\nmost circumstances. Thus, the need for\nunambiguous RCT evidence of screening efficacy\nin a UK setting is paramount. Closely related to\nefficacy is reliable information concerning the\nprevalence and incidence of potentially identifiable\nNSCLC in selected populations. The disparity in\nprevalence findings between the Irish study and\nUSA ELCAP studies raises serious doubts about the\nextent of detectable disease that may be expected\nin the UK.

Current estimates suggest that a large\nnumber of people screened will be falsely\nidentified by LDCT as probably or possibly\nsuffering from NSCLC. No attempt has yet been\nmade to assess the psychological consequences on\nthose affected (including their families), and the\nevidence on the physical risks associated with\nconfirmatory testing is limited.\nNone of the published economic studies has\nadequately considered the implications of\nincidental findings from screening. The Irish\nstudy52 suggests that as many as half of those\nscreened will have such findings, resulting in\nconsiderable increases in costs and administrative\nworkload. Any UK-based RCTs of screening\nshould include comprehensive recording of all\nincidental findings and follow-up investigations\nand treatments.\nSerious shortcomings are apparent in the evidence\navailable on healthcare resource use associated\nwith lung cancer and its treatment in the UK,\npartly related to the lack of a high-quality cancer\nregister database similar to SEER in the USA. \nThe failure of regional cancer registries to achieve\nthe completeness of coverage of all types of\nrelevant patient data suggests that there may be a\ncase for new investment and\/or greater priority for\nthis function.\nEconomic evaluation of lung cancer screening\n52\nTABLE 16 Elements of health-related cost required for evaluation of lung cancer screening (cont\u2019d)\nCost element Description Comment Resource and  Sources\ncost data\nSupportive and\ncontinuing care\nA wide range of health\nneeds may occur\nthroughout a patient\u2019s\nremaining life.

However, it may be\nargued that other options should also be\nintroduced into an economic assessment. First,\nincreased expenditure on preventive measures to\nencourage smoking cessation, or to prevent young\npeople taking up smoking, may offer viable\nalternatives, with long-term public health benefits\nand potential economic gains. Second, lung cancer\ntreatment in UK is characterised by a generally\nless aggressive approach to surgical intervention,\nbut also worse survival outcomes than many\nEuropean or North American countries.\nIncreasing services and funds to allow more lung\ncancer patients to be actively managed can be\nexpected to yield important gains, which may also\nbe competitive in economic terms.\nIt appears that the evidence available on the\nefficacy of CT screening is not yet strong enough\nto permit a judgement to be made on whether it\nshould be implemented in the UK. The primary\nrequirement is for UK-based RCTs to be carried\nout.

The criteria are\npublished by the NSC on their website.\nThis chapter applies the 22 criteria to lung cancer\nscreening and summarises the evidence presented\nin the previous chapters. The authors\u2019 view on the\nextent to which the criteria are satisfied is\nappended after each criterion.\nThe condition\n1. The condition should be an important health\nproblem\nBy any definition of important, including\nfrequency of the disease, severity of the\nconsequences and economic burden, lung cancer\nis as an important health problem in the UK.\nLung cancer heads the cancer league tables in the\nUK for deaths, with around 34,000 people dying\neach year. Prognosis is bleak and presentation as a\nresult of symptoms is generally late. Less than 10%\nof people survive for more than 5 years after\ndiagnosis in the UK. Survival, while better in some\nother countries and variable even within the UK,\ndoes not surpass 20% at 5 years. At the time of\nwriting this report, NICE was in the process of\nissuing guidance for the diagnosis and\nmanagement of lung cancer.1 This guidance was\nissued in 2005. Although this may improve\nsurvival to some extent, the best way of improving\nsurvival is by surgical resection of tumours before\nthey have spread. Most lung cancers are detected\neither as incidental findings on chest imaging or\nbecause of symptoms. For most, symptoms reflect\nthe advance of the disease and 80% of lung cancer\nin the UK presents with stage III or above. Less\nthan 10% of patients proceed to surgical resection.\nAuthors\u2019 summary opinion: Fully satisfied.\n2. The epidemiology and natural history of the\ncondition, including development from latent to\ndeclared disease, should be adequately\nunderstood and there should be a detectable risk\nfactor, disease marker, latent period or early\nsymptomatic stage\nScreening studies have identified important gaps\nin our understanding of lung cancer\nepidemiology. The wide variation in prevalence\nfound, for example, when comparing ELCAP to\nthe MacRedmond study indicates that assumptions\nof equivalence in disease detection rates cannot be\nmade.30,52 There is evidence that stage I and II\ndisease is associated with better survival with\nsurgery, but progresses to cause death if surgery is\nnot undertaken, but this comes solely from\nunscreened populations. There are few data on\nlong-term follow-up of those with lung cancer\ndetected by screening. Some of those data from\nscreening programmes, particularly if non-\nsmokers are included, suggest that screening may\ninclude the detection of some well-differentiated\ntumours that grow more slowly, with a high\nproportion of atypical adenomatous\nhyperplasia\/bronchioloalveolar adenoma. There is\nevidence of debate among histopathologists about\nthe nature of this pathological finding, but it is\nvisible on CT as an NCN. One of the screening\nstudies has reported information about tumour\ngrowth and indicates that some of the well-\ndifferentiated small cancers detected by screening\ngrow very slowly.43 At present, there is insufficient\nunderstanding to quantify the relationship\nbetween NCNs, screening-detected lung cancer\nand outcome.\nAuthors\u2019 summary opinion: Not satisfied.\n3. All the cost-effective primary prevention\ninterventions should have been implemented as\nfar as practicable\nAs smoking remains the predominant risk factor\nfor lung cancer, one could argue as to whether\neverything practicable has been done by way of\nprimary prevention.

There should be a simple, safe, precise and\nvalidated screening test\nCT is a relatively simple investigation, at least from\nthe patients\u2019 perspective. It involves the use of a\ntechnology that has wide penetration throughout\nthe NHS. The safety of CT is good in terms of\nacute adverse events. However, it does involve a\nradiation dose that, while substantially reduced in\ncomparison to standard-dose CT, is higher than\nthat of a chest X-ray. The evidence of long-term\nsafety in terms of radiation-induced cancers is not\ncurrently available. LDCT has been compared with\nstandard dose and has been demonstrated to lose\nlittle in terms of precision for the identification of\nNCN in the lung. In the setting of screening, there\nis no gold standard for assessing validity other than\nlong-term follow-up and investigation of those with\nabnormal screening CT examinations. LDCT is a\nsensitive tool, identifying large numbers of\nabnormalities in the lung. However, among the\nstudies reported here, the specificity was poor.\nMany people had to undergo further investigation,\noften involving further radiation exposure.\nAuthors\u2019 summary opinion: Partially satisfied.\n6. The distribution of test values in the target\npopulation should be known and a suitable cut-off\nlevel defined and agreed\nThe international studies that have been included\nin this review demonstrate a variation in the\nprevalence of positive CT examinations among the\ndifferent studies. This occurs even where similar\ndefinitions of a positive CT have been used. The\ndifferences may reflect differences between the\npopulations and as a result, make it difficult to\ngeneralise from studies conducted outside the UK.\nAlthough there is evidence that the risk of cancer\nincreases with increased NCN size, there is no\nconsensus about what constitutes a size that is too\nsmall to cause significant risk of unresectable\ncancer before the subsequent round of screening.\nOf course, it is not the size per se that is of\nimportance, but rather the growth rate. In very\nsmall nodules it should be noted that detecting an\nimportant change in diameter can be challenging.\nAuthors\u2019 summary opinion: Not satisfied for the\nUK population.\n7. The test should be acceptable to the\npopulation\nThe studies reported here provide little if any\ninformation about the acceptability of CT in the\nsetting of a screening programme, which may be\nreduced by full explanation of the possible harms\nof radiation.\nAuthors\u2019 summary opinion: Not satisfied.\n8. There should be an agreed policy on the\nfurther diagnostic investigation of individuals with\na positive test result and on the choices available\nto those individuals\nIn 2005, NICE issued on guidelines for the\ndiagnosis and management of lung cancer\npresenting symptomatically or incidentally. These\nguidelines were not constructed for the\nmanagement of screening-detected lung cancer\nand modifications would be required if CT\nscreening were to be adopted in the future. From\nthe current evidence, there is no consensus on the\ndefinition of a positive CT examination or how\nindividuals with a single small nodule should be\nfollowed up in terms of either repeat imaging or\nbiopsy. Similarly, the subsequent surgical\nmanagement of screening-detected tumours has\nnot been agreed.\nAuthors\u2019 summary opinion: Not satisfied.\n9.

More\nadvanced stage disease is associated with poor\nsurvival. For those not fit enough for surgery, there\nis also evidence of better survival among early-\nstage disease for those treated with radiotherapy.\nHowever, their survival is substantially worse than\nafter surgical resection.

There should be agreed evidence-based\npolicies covering which individuals should be\noffered treatment and the appropriate\ntreatment to be offered\nNICE guidelines cover this, but it has not been\ndemonstrated that screening-detected lesions\nshould be managed in the same way as those\npresenting as incidental findings or with symptoms.\nAs discussed above, there is no consensus on what\nconstitutes a positive screening test and how best to\nfollow up such individuals.\nAuthors\u2019 summary opinion: Partially satisfied.\n12.

Evidence from the \u2018best supportive care\u2019\narms of studies in the UK is comparable to\nEurope, so does not support the notion that the\ndisease is more aggressive or diagnosed later in\nthe UK.

Although this assumption\nmay be attractive, it is fraught with problems,\nparticularly for a condition that reaches a peak\nincidence among the over 70-year-olds and is\nassociated with heavy and prolonged smoking. In\naddition, there is currently no consensus on what\ndefinition should be used for a positive screening\ntest or how best to follow up those with positive\nscreening tests. Finally, certain groups are at an\nincreased risk of lung cancer based on age and\nexposure to cigarette smoke or as a result of\noccupational exposures, current or past. To date,\nthere is insufficient evidence to support the\nrecommendation of screening for lung cancer in\nany of these \u2018high-risk\u2019 groups. However, they\nshould be considered in the designing of any\nfuture screening studies, when gathering\nepidemiological data about lung cancer and in the\neconomic evaluation of screening should future\nstudies conclude that there is an improvement in\nmortality as a result of CT screening.\nIn considering the economic argument for CT\nscreening for lung cancer, this study has\nsystematically considered the elements that would be\nfundamental to any economic analysis. In doing so,\nthe conclusion was reached that it is not currently\npossible to produce a meaningful economic analysis.\nThe lack of evidence of clinical effectiveness is\nclearly fundamental but, in addition, uncertainty\naround the understanding of the natural history of\nscreening-detected NCN and lung cancer, and the\npoorly understood risk of harm associated with high\nproportions of false-positive screening results are\namong the problems identified.\nOccupational at-risk groups\nAs noted previously, the increased risk of NSCLC\nlung cancer associated with certain occupations\nand exposures, particularly asbestos, may warrant\nconsideration of the feasibility of a screening\nprogramme for workers or ex-workers. At present,\nno RCTs have been conducted to assess\neffectiveness of screening in such occupational\ngroups. As the lead time for development of lung\ncancer in asbestos- and silica-exposed workers is\nlong, screening should focus on workers exposed\nin the past. A case for screening would, therefore,\nhave to be made on an occupation-by-occupation\nbasis with evidence of the feasibility of running an\neffective screening programme in that specific\npopulation. Given the distribution of exposure to\nsubstances such as asbestos, with highest exposure\nin the UK among workers in shipbuilding areas\nsuch as Glasgow, Newcastle and Portsmouth, it\nmay be feasible to use employee work records or\nother means (such as local support groups and\ntrade unions) to identify at-risk individuals for\nscreening in these areas, although appropriate\napproaches would depend on local circumstances.\nThe logistics of identifying people who were \nat risk in the past would have to be investigated.\nThe HSE would be an important collaborator \nand source of information under these\ncircumstances.\nSpecific weakness of the \nevidence base\nTo date, most of the clinical effectiveness data\nhave come from clinical studies with no\ncomparator group. While this design will help \nour understanding of issues of feasibility, \nprotocols and to an extent the natural history of\nthe lesions detected, they do not answer the\nfundamental question: does screening reduce\nmortality? That cannot be answered without\ncontrol groups.\nAll the current studies are of relatively short\nduration when considering the long-term survival\nof patients with lung cancer. The studies have also\nbeen restricted in terms of number of participants,\nand hence have limitations in terms of power\nwhen considering population screening for a\ncondition that has a prevalence of around 2% in\nthe participants screened.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 3\n59\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

The detection of\nincidental disease other than lung cancer also\nvaried substantially between studies. The lack of\nrobust and detailed UK data on stage from lung\ncancer registries has been identified in previous\nlung cancer-related technology appraisal reports\nand remains an issue when trying to model\nsurvival. There is also a lack of data about the\ncurrent costs and utilisation of lung cancer\nservices, which makes meaningful extrapolation of\ncosts difficult.\nConclusions for NHS and NHS\npolicy\nIn the authors\u2019 view, CT screening for lung cancer\ndoes not currently meet the accepted NSC criteria.\nTable 17 summarises the current evidence, but\nmost criteria are not satisfied, with no RCTs, no\nevidence of clinical effectiveness against mortality\nand no evidence of cost-effectiveness. Even if all\nthe other criteria were satisfied, a screening\nprogramme would have to pass the cost per QALY\nhurdle; the threshold range generally followed by\nNICE is \u00a320,000\u201330,000 per QALY, although it is\nfar from certain that the NHS can afford as much\nas that.\nCT studies planned or in progress\nTable 18 briefly outlines the CT screening studies\nfor lung cancer that were identified with the\nsearch strategy as being underway at present.\nSome of these studies will eventually provide\ninformation relating to the effect of screening on\nmortality. Others may add to our understanding of\nthe natural history of NCNs detected by screening,\nabout the protocols used for screening and about\nwhich populations will benefit most from\nscreening. Only the LUCAS trial is anticipated to\noccur in the UK, but it currently remains\nunfunded.

In the\nmeantime, addressing the other research needs\nabove would facilitate a rapid response to studies\nif they did demonstrate effectiveness of screening. \nResearch needs\nIn terms of what information is needed to make\nsuch a decision, the following research needs were\nidentified.\n  RCT evidence is needed that CT screening\nreduces mortality, either with whole-population\nscreening or for particular subgroups.\n  UK data about the rate of positive screening CT\nand detected lung cancers could be obtained\nfrom an RCT or a cohort study. Even relatively\nsmall-scale studies would provide valuable\ninformation when trying to assess the\ngeneralisability of RCT data currently being\nconducted elsewhere.\n  There is a need to understand better the\nnatural history and epidemiology of screening-\ndetected lung cancers, particularly small, well-\ndifferentiated adenocarcinomas. This could be\nmet, in part, by lung cancer screening RCT or\ncohort studies, but a review of existing\npublished epidemiological and pathological\ndata along with primary analysis of UK lung\ncancer epidemiology would valuably inform\ncurrent understanding.\n  Information about the quality of life impact of\nCT screening, acceptability of screening, and\nuptake and retention rates in the UK would be\nvaluable in any future assessment of the cost-\neffectiveness of screening in the UK.\n  Increased routine collection is needed of UK\nhealth service data regarding resource\navailability, utilisation and safety data for lung\ncancer management and services.\n  Research is needed into the feasibility and\nmethods of tracking those who were previously\noccupationally exposed to lung carcinogens.\nThe authors believe that screening for lung cancer\nusing CT cannot be recommended based on\ncurrent evidence and, while more definitive\nevidence of effectiveness is being sought, priority\nshould be given to reducing exposure to risk\nfactors for lung cancer, in particular smoking.\nTABLE 18 Studies of CT screening planned or in progress\nTrial Country Methods Timing and current status\nDEPISCAN118 France RCT of CT vs CXR.
