Studies assessed survival, functional capacity, and quality of life.\nCost-effectiveness was assessed through a 5-year decision analytic model to estimate the\nincremental cost-effectiveness ratio for using left ventricular assist devices compared with\nusual care.\nResults: Six studies met the inclusion criteria, showing that left ventricular assist devices\nappear beneficial, improving survival and quality of life. Adverse events are a serious\nconcern. The economic evaluation showed that left ventricular assist devices had a cost\nper quality adjusted life year of \u00a3170,616. Sensitivity analysis showed that the\ncost-effectiveness was not sensitive to changes in costs or utility.\nConclusions: Although left ventricular assist devices appear clinically effective as\ndestination therapy, it is unlikely they will be cost-effective unless costs decrease or the\nbenefits of their use increase.\nKeywords: Heart failure, Left ventricular assist devices, Systematic review, Economic\nevaluation, Health technology assessment\nFor people with severe or end-stage heart failure (ESHF),\ntreatment options are limited. Heart transplantation has been\nthe only treatment that has provided substantial benefit,\nimproving the length and quality of life (3;18). Serious short-\nages in donor organs have restricted the use of heart trans-\nplantation to a few (11;12;19). As a result, increasing at-\ntention has focused on the role of mechanical circulatory\nsupport, either as a replacement for the natural heart (total\nartificial hearts) or as a support that works in parallel with\nthe heart (ventricular assist device). Left ventricular assist\ndevices (LVADs), originally developed to bridge people to\nheart transplantation, have continued to evolve. Miniaturiza-\ntion, low power use, and ease of implantation, allied with\ndecreasing costs and advances in patient care, have made\nLVADs an acceptable treatment option (14). With the increas-\ning scarcity of donor organs for transplantation, people have\nbeen supported for longer periods, extending to months or\neven years. Inevitably, this finding has raised the possibility of\nusing LVADs as destination therapy, providing an alternative\nthrough long-term chronic support for those awaiting heart\ntransplantation or those ineligible for transplantation. With\nthe fast changing nature of the technology and more than\ntwenty different devices having been developed, uncertainty\nremains as to the suitability of these devices as destination\ntherapy. Before adopting new technologies, it is important\nto evaluate the evidence of their benefits, risks, and costs.\nThis study summarizes the results of a systematic review\nand economic evaluation commissioned by the Department\nof Health\u2019s Health Technology Assessment Programme to\nassess the evidence of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of\nall available LVADs used as destination therapy for people\nwith ESHF (2).\nMETHODS\nWe searched for published and unpublished studies using\neighteen electronic databases, including Medline, Cochrane\nLibrary, and Embase, from their inception to December 2004\nwith no language restrictions (details of search strategy avail-\nable elsewhere) (2). Also, we searched through bibliogra-\nphies of related publications and contacted relevant experts\nand manufacturers of LVADs to identify additional refer-\nences. Studies reported as abstracts or conference presenta-\ntions were only considered for inclusion if adequate details\nof their methodology and results were provided to judge the\nquality and rigor of the study.\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), con-\ntrolled clinical trials, cohort studies, case series, and case\nstudies that evaluated currently available LVADs used as\ndestination therapy for people 16 years of age and older\nwith ESHF. Natural history studies were sought as it was\nrecognized that experimental studies of this rapidly evolving\ntechnology may be scarce. These studies may provide useful\nevidence of effectiveness where outcomes are poor and pre-\ndictable without treatment (21). We placed an emphasis on\nincluding studies that used the most rigorous study designs\nand that included an appropriate comparator, whether another\nLVAD or optimal medical management. We excluded studies\nif LVADs were used during the perioperative period only or\nas an emergency rescue strategy during an operation. Studies\nwere included if they assessed survival, functional capacity,\nor quality of life as primary outcome measures. Standard\ncriteria were used to assess the quality of included studies\n(1;20). Two reviewers independently applied inclusion crite-\nria, extracted data, and assessed quality. Any differences were\nresolved through independent assessment by a third reviewer.\nWe extracted standard information on study characteristics,\nmethods, and results wherever possible to allow comparison\nacross different studies. Clinical effectiveness was assessed\nthrough a narrative comparison of different outcomes. Differ-\nences in, or insufficient details on, study designs, outcomes\nused, patient characteristics, or intervention used precluded\nmeta-analysis.\nThe economic evaluation developed for this study was\na cost utility analysis using a decision analytic model\nbased on a Markov approach. A detailed discussion of the\n262 INTL. J. OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE 23:2, 2007\nLVADs as destination therapy\nmethodology used to develop the evaluation is available else-\nwhere (2). It compared the benefits and costs of the use of\nLVADs with that of usual medical care as destination therapy\nfor people with ESHF through calculation of an incremental\ncost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (6). The evaluation adopted\nan National Health Service and Personal Social Services per-\nspective for costs and benefits for 2003 (UK prices). The base\ncase focused on devices that were considered to be the most\nclinically effective in the systematic review. Benefits were as-\nsessed in terms of changes in patient survival and quality of\nlife. The Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance\nfor the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH)\nstudy (15), which compared the HeartMate Vented Electric\n(VE) LVAD with optimal medical management, provided the\nonly source of data measuring patient survival with an indi-\ncation of time to an event through Kaplan\u2013Meier survival\ncurves. Although these survival curves were censored at 30\nmonths, we extended these through survival analysis until\nall patients had died (60 months) to ensure all survival ben-\nefits were accounted for in the model. No studies reporting\nutility values for destination therapy were identified by the\nsystematic review. Instead, we obtained utility values using\na panel-based approach, mapping the Minnesota Living with\nHeart Failure questionnaire to utilities using different scenar-\nios from data reported in the REMATCH study (2;15). Costs\nreflected current clinical practice in the United Kingdom and\noriginate from the systematic review, expert clinical advice,\nUK hospitals, and device manufacturers (Table 1) (2). Bene-\nfits were discounted at 1.5 percent and costs at 6 percent. Re-\nsults were presented as incremental cost per quality-adjusted\nTable 1.

One-way and multiway sen-\nsitivity analyses examining different devices, costs, utilities,\nefficacy, and discounting were carried out.\nRESULTS\nSystematic Review of Clinical\nEffectiveness\nSix studies assessing the clinical effectiveness of LVADs as\ndestination therapy for ESHF met the inclusion criteria, with\nstudies of the HeartMate VE LVAD (15), LionHeart LVAD\n(7), Novacor LVAD (4;5), Toyobo LVAD (16), and Jarvik\n2000 LVAD (8;10;17;22;24). Only the RCT assessing the\nHeartMate VE LVAD included a comparator (15), that of op-\ntimal medical management, with the remaining studies being\neither case studies (4;5;7;9;16) or case series (8;10;17;22;24).\nQuantity and Quality of Evidence\nThe methodological quality and the quality of reporting of\nthe case series and case studies were judged to be weak.\nThe five studies lacked rigorous study designs and alloca-\ntion process, as well as providing limited information on\nthe selection of participants, blinding, and methods of data\ncollection (Table 2) (4;5;7;10;16;17;22;24). In contrast, the\nRCT comparing the use of the HeartMate VE LVAD with\noptimal medical management was judged to be moderate\nin its methodological quality and quality of reporting (15).\nAlthough it had a strong study design and appeared to use\nappropriate methods of allocation, it lacked an adequate de-\nscription of the actual methods of randomization. The RCT\nwas judged to be weak in its selection of a representative\npatient group, a consequence of changes to the a priori se-\nlection criteria to ensure adequate enrollment. The risk of\nconfounding was considered low as the study demonstrated\nthat there were no significant differences between groups.\nBlinding of patients and treating surgeons to interventions\nwas impossible and, despite efforts to limit the effects of\nobservational bias through the use of independent blinded\nobservers to judge outcomes, was judged to be methodolog-\nically weak. The validity and reliability of data collection\ntools was considered weak due to the limited discussion in\nthe trial report. Reporting of withdrawals and drop-outs was\nthought to be methodologically strong, identifying numbers\nof, and reasons for, withdrawal as well as undertaking an in-\ntention to treat analysis. The external validity of the studies\nwas assessed through a comparison of the characteristics of\nthe different patient groups (2). Although limited informa-\ntion was provided, studies tend to focus on male patients 60\nyears of age and older who had suffered ischemic or dilated\ncardiomyopathy and were ineligible for heart transplantation.\nSurvival\nStudies showed that people supported with an LVAD had\na survival benefit when compared with those on optimal\nINTL.

The REMATCH trial reported that the HeartMate\nVE LVAD provided a statistically significant 48 percent re-\nduction in the risk of death from any cause at 30 months\ncompared with optimal medical management (15). Actuarial\nsurvival was significantly higher for people with the Heart-\nMate VE LVAD compared with optimal medical manage-\nment at 1 year (survival difference 27 percent) and 2 years\n(survival difference 15 percent) follow-up. Survival bene-\nfits from the HeartMate LVAD were evident for people 60\nyears of age and younger and those 60 to 69 years of age\nat 1-year follow-up. Studies of other devices were limited\nto case studies or case series with no comparator, provid-\ning only an indication of any additional benefit gained when\ncompared with the natural history of the ESHF. A series of\nsix case studies of the LionHeart LVAD showed all survived\nimplantation of the device and that 50 percent survived to\n18 months postimplantation (7). Case studies of the Nova-\ncor and Toyobo LVADs reported that a patient receiving a\nNovacor LVAD survived for over 4 years before dying (4;5)\nand a patient receiving a Toyobo LVAD was still alive after\n6 months (16). A case series of seven patients who received\na Jarvik 2000 LVAD reported that five continued to undergo\nsupport (8;10;17;22;24). Mean survival for the four patients\nat the UK center was 502 days (range, 95 to 889 days) and\nfor the 3 patients at the German center was 93 days (range,\n66 days to 145 days). A separate case report of the Jarvik\n2000 LVAD reported survival of a patient until discharge 6\nweeks after implantation (9).\nFunctional Status\nChanges to functional status were assessed in the REMATCH\ntrial and a case series (15;23). The REMATCH trial showed\nthat significantly more patients surviving on the HeartMate\nLVAD experienced improvement in their functional status on\nthe New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classi-\nfication (baseline 100 percent NYHA IV; 12 months 100\npercent NYHA II) compared with those on optimal medical\nmanagement (baseline 100 percent NYHA IV; 12 months 64\npercent NYHA IV) (15). Similar improvements on NYHA\nfunctional classification were reported in a case series for\nthree patients with Jarvik 2000 LVAD (baseline 100 percent\nNYHA IV; 4 weeks postimplantation 66 percent NYHA I,\n33 percent NYHA II) (23).\nQuality of Life\nThe REMATCH trial and a case series of the Jarvik 2000\nLVAD provided the only evidence on changes in quality of\nlife following LVAD implantation (Table 4) (15;23). Patients\nwith the HeartMate LVAD reported a significantly better\nquality of life at 12 months after device implantation on\nthe physical function and emotional role subscales of the\nthirty-six item Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Gen-\neral Health Survey and on the Beck Depression Inventory\nwhen compared with patients on optimal medical manage-\nment (15). Similar improvements were shown on the Min-\nnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire, although dif-\nferences were not statistically significant. A case series of\n264 INTL. J.

People receiving a HeartMate LVAD were twice as likely\nto suffer a serious adverse event as those on optimal medical\nmanagement (rate ratio [RR], 2.35; 95 percent confidence\ninterval [CI], 1.86\u20132.95), with significantly higher rates of\nnon-neurological bleeding (RR, 9.47; 95 percent CI, 2.30\u2013\n38.90) and neurologic dysfunction (RR, 4.35; 95 percent CI,\n1.31\u201314.50) (15). Also those with a HeartMate LVAD had\nhigher rates of supraventricular arrhythmias (RR, 3.92; 95\npercent CI, .47\u201332.40), sepsis (RR, 2.03; 95 percent CI, .99\u2013\n4.13), local infection (RR, 1.63; 95 percent CI, .72\u20133.70),\nrenal failure (RR, 1.42; 95 percent CI, .54\u20133.71), miscella-\nneous adverse events (RR, 1.41; 95 percent CI, .93\u20132.12),\nsyncope (RR, 1.31; 95 percent CI, .12\u201314.40), and serious\npsychiatric disease (RR, 1.31; 95 percent CI, .12\u201314.30) than\npatients receiving optimal medical management. In contrast,\npeople receiving optimal medical management had higher\nrates of ventricular arrhythmias (RR, .45; 95 percent CI, .22\u2013\n.90), cardiac arrest (RR, .65; 95 percent CI, .21\u20132.00), and\nnonperioperative myocardial infarction (RR, .65; 95 percent\nCI, .04\u201310.30). Of the patients who died while supported\nby a HeartMate LVAD, 41 percent were due to sepsis, 17\npercent to LVAD failure, and 10 percent to cerebrovascu-\nlar disease. Some 93 percent of the deaths among optimal\nmedical management patients were due to left ventricular\ndysfunction. A series of six case reports of the LionHeart\nLVAD showed that patients suffered from temporary hemol-\nysis (50 percent), bleeding (50 percent), early arrhythmia\n(40 percent), and other adverse events (7). It was reported\nthat none of the patients with the LionHeart LVAD were re-\nadmitted with infection, thromboembolic complications, or\narrhythmias. Case studies of the Novacor (4;5) and Toyobo\n(16) LVADs reported that a patient with the Novacor device\nsuffered from transient renal failure, bronchopneumonia, and\nfebrile episodes due to device-related infection, whereas a pa-\ntient with a Toyobo LVAD suffered from multiple cerebral\nembolisms and thrombi within the pump. The case series\nof seven patients with Jarvik 2000 LVADs reported a case\nof dyspnea, ventricular tachycardia, power supply problems,\nand infection (8;10;17;22;24). No other device-related mal-\nfunctions or infections were reported.\nCost-Effectiveness of LVADs as\nDestination Therapy for ESHF\nWith no relevant cost-effectiveness studies available (2),\nwe developed an economic evaluation to assess the cost-\neffectiveness of LVADs as destination therapy within the UK\nsetting. A base case comparison of the use of the Heart-\nMate LVAD with optimal medical management showed that\nthe LVAD offered an additional .6 quality-adjusted life-years\n(QALYs) per patient over the 5-year duration of the model\nat an additional cost of \u00a3102,000, producing an incremental\ncost per QALY of \u00a3170,616 (Table 5).\nOne-way sensitivity analysis has shown that the model\nwas not sensitive to changes in costs, discount rates, or\nchanges in utility (Table 5). Only when survival improves\nby 60 percent and device costs are reduced by 60 percent\ncompared with the base case scenario does the incremen-\ntal cost-effectiveness ratio approach the generally accepted\ncost-effectiveness thresholds for the United Kingdom (cost\nper QALY, \u00a330,000) (13).\nDISCUSSION\nThe systematic review has revealed the lack of good qual-\nity evidence assessing the clinical effectiveness of LVADs\nas destination therapy for people with ESHF. Despite these\nlimitations, it appears that LVADs are beneficial when com-\npared with optimal medical management or to the natural\nhistory of ESHF, improving the length and quality of life\nof patients. However, it is evident that adverse events were\nassociated with their use, including device malfunctions, in-\nfections, and bleeding. When comparing the various devices,\nthe evidence was less clear due to the scarcity and poor\nquality of the studies available, as well as the lack of di-\nrect comparisons. Only the REMATCH trial comparing the\nHeartMate VE LVAD with optimal medical management had\nsufficient rigor to judge efficacy, showing benefit for patients\nwith an LVAD on measures of survival, functional status, and\nquality of life. Studies of the Novacor, LionHeart, Toyobo,\nand Jarvik 2000 were of poor methodological quality with no\ncomparator, limiting any comparison. Further investigations\nare needed to adequately compare the different devices, tak-\ning into account the developments in devices, implantation\ntechniques, and patient care.\nLimited evidence on the cost-effectiveness of LVADs\nas destination therapy necessitated the development of a de\nnovo economic evaluation for the United Kingdom (2). The\nanalysis showed that LVADs are not a cost-effective option\nwith a cost per QALY of \u00a3170,616, which lies outside the\nthreshold for acceptability in the United Kingdom of \u00a330,000\nper QALY (13). One-way sensitivity analysis showed that\ncost-effectiveness was not sensitive to changes in the costs\nassociated with care, discount rates, or measures of utility.\nIn fact, multiway sensitivity analysis showed that there\nwould need to be reductions of over 60 percent in the cost of\nthe devices as well as substantial improvements of over 60\npercent in the length and quality of life of the patient for cost-\neffectiveness to reach a cost per QALY of \u00a330,000. Although\nit is likely that the cost of devices will decline as the technol-\nogy develops and diffuses, doubts remain as to the extent to\nwhich additional benefits can be achieved. Some of the un-\ncertainty reflects limitations in the evidence on benefits and\ncosts available, particularly for the new axial flow devices.\n266 INTL. J.

Contact was made\nwith manufacturers, the major specialist centers implanting\nLVADs in the United Kingdom, and authors of studies to try\nand obtain additional information, with varying success. The\neconomic evaluation used the most up to date data available,\nwith evidence from our systematic review of clinical effec-\ntiveness, patient utility data from on-going primary research\nusing a panel-based approach, and cost data from specialist\ncenters in the United Kingdom and device manufacturers.\nAlthough the evaluation included different types of de-\nvices, the evidence on benefits and costs tended to focus on\nthe more established displacement pulsatile devices, partic-\nularly the HeartMate LVAD. With the emergence of the new\naxial flow devices and their increasing use in clinical prac-\ntice, it is inevitable that the evidence base will continue to\nimprove. It will be important to incorporate any emerging ev-\nidence into our systematic review and economic evaluation\nto ensure it accurately assesses their benefits, risks, and costs.\nSeveral areas for research have emerged, including the\nepidemiology of ESHF to assess incidence, prevalence, and\ncharacteristics of sufferers; long-term (at least 5 years follow-\nup) RCTs focusing on head to head comparisons of different\ndevices and optimal medical management that encompass\na broad range of patient groups and assess patient survival,\nfunctional ability, quality of life, and adverse events; and eco-\nnomic evaluations as part of clinical trials with prospective\ncollection of data on quality of life, utilities, resources, and\ncosts.\nPOLICY IMPLICATIONS\nNew developments in LVADs and the management of pa-\ntients have brought optimism concerning the permanent use\nof LVADs for people with ESHF. The lack of alternative\ntreatment options has increased attention on the possibility\nINTL. J.

Despite the limited evidence assessing the effectiveness\nof LVADs as destination therapy, our study has shown that\nLVADs appear to be clinically effective, improving survival\nand quality of life. However, currently they are not a cost-\neffective option. As a consequence, it is unlikely that funding\nof a service within the UK National Health Service would be\njustified at present. Despite this outlook, it will be important\nto continue to fund further good quality comparative research\nto assess the benefits, risks, and costs of this rapidly develop-\ning technology. This research should be undertaken as part\nof a nationally coordinated and funded formal research pro-\ngram allowing the research objectives to be progressed while\nmaintaining the skills and structure of the current service.\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nAndrew J.
