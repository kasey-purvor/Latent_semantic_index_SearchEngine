In this\npaper, we propose a margin-adaptive BPL approach for orthog-\nonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems assisted by\na single cooperative relay. This orthogonal half-duplex relay op-\nerates either in the selection detection-and-forward (SDF) mode\nor in the amplify-and-forward (AF) mode.

Assuming perfect channel knowl-\nedge is available at all nodes, the proposed approach is to minimize\nthe transmit-power consumption at the target throughput (average\nnumber of bits\/symbol) and the target link performance. With re-\nspect to various power-constraint conditions, we investigate two\ndistributed resource-allocation strategies, namely flexible power\nratio (FLPR) and fixed power ratio (FIPR). The FLPR strategy is\nproposed for scenarios without individual local power constraint.\nThe source power and relay power have a flexible ratio for each\nsubcarrier. The FIPR strategy is proposed for scenarios with indi-\nvidual local power constraint. The source power and relay power\nhave a fixed ratio for each subcarrier.

INTRODUCTION\nEMERGING wireless applications such as wireless mul-tihop networks and mesh networks have an increasing\ndemand for high spectral-efficiency and quality-of-service.\nHowever, the networking performance can be limited by di-\nverse quality of wireless channels amongst distributed nodes.\nThe performance can be significantly improved if distributed\nnodes can efficiently share their local radio resources. This\nhas motivated significant research activity towards what is\ncalled cooperative communications or cooperative relaying\ntechnologies (e.g., [1], [2]). The basic structure for cooperative\ncommunications is the three-node relaying network accommo-\ndating one source, one relay, and one destination [3].

The destination can\nemploy maximum-ratio combining (MRC) of the received sig-\nnals to achieve the maximum distributed spatial diversity-gain.\nMoreover, Chen and Laneman have proposed a piecewise-linear\ncombining scheme to offer the near-optimum performance for\nnoncoherent cooperative communications [6], [7]. Recently,\nEuropean Commission has been considering to apply the co-\noperative relaying concept in the future high-data-rate cellular\nservices (e.g., [8], [9]). The relaying node can either be a fixed\nrelaying station or a low-mobility user [10]. This can com-\nbine the merits of the cooperative relaying technique with the\nadvanced air-interface such as orthogonal frequency-division\nmultiplexing (OFDM). Then, one of interesting research issues\nis to investigate the bit and power loading (BPL) technologies\nfor the OFDM-based cooperative communications.\nThe BPL techniques have been intensively investigated for\nthe single-link communications. They use the channel feedback\nto determine the number of bits per symbol and the required\npower for each subchannel in a parallel set of subchannels. The\nwater-filling algorithm turns out to be the optimum BPL ap-\nproach. However, this optimum approach may result in frac-\ntional number of bits\/symbol, which can complicate encode\/\ndecoder (or modulation\/demodulation) implementation. Practi-\ncally, one can employ two well-known suboptimum BPL ap-\nproaches, i.e., the margin-adaptive algorithm and the rate-adap-\ntive algorithm, to offer the near water-filling solution and the in-\nteger number of bits\/symbol [11], [12]. Specifically, the margin-\nadaptive approach is to minimize the transmit power subject to\nthe target number of bits per block and the target link perfor-\nmance. This approach has received considerable applications in\nthe OFDM systems. For instance, Wong et al. have investigated\nthe margin-adaptive approach for the OFDM-FDMA systems\n[13]. Their investigation has included the single-user link adap-\ntation and the multi-user resource competition. The rate-adap-\ntive approach is to maximize the number of bits per block sub-\nject to the fixed transmit-power and the target link performance.\nThis approach has also received considerable applications in the\nOFDM systems (e.g., [14]).\nIn this paper, we investigate the margin-adaptive BPL\napproach for the OFDM-based three-node relaying communi-\ncations. The orthogonal half-duplex relay can employ either\nthe symbol-level-selection (SLS) DF protocol or the AF pro-\ntocol for retransmission. MRC is employed at the destination\nto maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As-\nsuming perfect channel knowledge is available at all nodes,\nthe proposed approach is to improve the transmit-power ef-\nficiency for the distributed senders.

The FLPR strategy is\nproposed for scenarios without individual local power con-\nstraint. For example, an access point (source) communicates to\nan user terminal with the help of a relaying station. Both the\nsource and the relay can provide the required power to achieve\nthe target performance. In this case, the source and relay have\nan optimum (or suboptimum) distributed power allocation for\neach subcarrier. The total transmit-power is optimally (or sub-\noptimally) allocated between the source and relay. However, in\nmany cases, the distributed senders have their individual power\nconstrained, which cannot fulfill the optimum (or suboptimum)\ndistributed power allocation required by the FLPR strategy. For\nexample, a mobile relay might not be able to offer the sufficient\npower to support the FLPR strategy. In this case, we can em-\nploy the FIPR strategy, i.e., the source power and relay power\nhave a fixed ratio for each subcarrier. This approach reduces\nthe degree of freedom and offers a suboptimum solution to the\nproblem that controls the power expended by each sender.\nNote 1: Our performance investigation is focused on the\namount by which the proposed approaches can reduce the\nrequired transmit-power. The investigation is carried out\nby examining the average power-consumption per bit. This\nmethod has been employed for evaluating cost efficiency of\nan adaptive transmission system (e.g., [13]).\nNote 2: The proposed BPL approaches are optimized for\nthe uncoded source. Certainly, employing error-control-\ncodes can improve the link performance for adaptive trans-\nmissions [15], [16]. However, investigating BPL for coded-\nOFDM systems should take into account the impact of\ntime-frequency correlation. This can significantly compli-\ncate the theoretical analysis.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows.

SYSTEM MODEL AND PREPARATION\nA. OFDM-Based Relaying Communications\nThe OFDM system has been well documented in the litera-\nture (e.g., [17]). The major idea is to transmit the information-\nbearing symbols over a number of low-rate orthogonal subcar-\nriers. This is established by employing inverse discrete Fourier-\ntransform (IDFT) at the transmitter and DFT at the receiver. A\ncyclic prefix (CP) is employed for introducing the channel cir-\nculant property and mitigating the inter-block interference. The\nabove signal processing can effectively turn the frequency-se-\nlective channel into a number of parallel flat subchannels. The\nchannel equalization and symbol detection can be performed\nin the frequency-domain. To simplify the presentation, we will\nonly consider the frequency-domain signal representation in this\npaper.\nFig. 1 depicts the block diagram for the OFDM-based\nthree-node relaying communications. Prior to transmission, the\ninformation-bearing bits are first fed into the BPL component to\nproduce an symbol block ,\nwhere stands for the information-bearing symbol (with the\nvariance ) or zero symbol. These symbols are then\nmodulated onto corresponding subcarriers with the transmit\npower , where denotes the\ntransmit power for each subcarrier. This block goes through\nthe SD channel and the SR channel, respectively. Denoting\nto be the channel coefficients on subcarriers, the received\nfrequency-domain block at the destination and at the relay is\nexpressible as\n(1)\n(2)\nwhere denotes the white Gaussian noise with zero mean and\nvariance . The cooperative relay operates in the orthogonal\nhalf-duplex mode. After a certain signal processing, it can send\nan information-bearing block to the destination through the\nRD channel. Then, the destination can receive the second ver-\nsion of the information as below\n(3)\nThe format of is related to the specific relaying protocols.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Recently, it\nhas been reported (e.g., in [18]) that the nonorthogonal half-du-\nplex relays are employed in order to exploit the potential spatial\nmultiplexing-gain, i.e., both the source and the relays can send\nthe information at the same time\/frequency slot. However, this\nsystem setup results in different resource allocation strategy.\nHere, our investigation is carried out only for the typical setup\nintroduced in Section II-A.\nB. The SLS-DF Protocol\nThe selection DF relay has two typical protocols, i.e., frame-\nlevel-selection (FLS) DF and SLS-DF. In the FLS-DF protocol,\nthe relay forwards every correctly received frame to the desti-\nnation. In the SLS-DF protocol, the relay forwards every cor-\nrectly received (or reliable) symbol to the destination. Recently,\nthe SLS-DF protocol has received considerable attention for\ncooperative communications (e.g., [19]\u2013[22]). This is because\nthe SLS-DF protocol can offer the significant performance im-\nprovement in comparison with the FLS-DF protocol [22]. Ba-\nsically, the SLS-DF protocol has two modes, i.e., ideal mode\nor outage mode. In the ideal mode, the relay should be capable\nof symbol error detection. This demands employment of CRC\ncodes on the symbol level, which cannot be practically imple-\nmented [23]. In the outage mode, the relay can compute the re-\nceived SNR for each subcarrier. When the received SNR is not\nsmaller than a SNR threshold , the relay can forward the de-\ntected symbols to the destination. Sadek et al. have experimen-\ntally shown that the outage SLS-DF can offer very close perfor-\nmance to the ideal SLS-DF for the nonadaptive transmissions\n[22]. To clarify the presentation, here, we take the ideal mode\nas an example to introduce the SLS-DF protocol.\nThe ideal SLS-DF relay can relate the output to as\nbelow\n(4)\nThe vector can have zero elements corresponding to the un-\nforwarded symbols or zero symbols. Define an diagonal\nmatrix . The destination can employ\nMRC of and to yield\n(5)\nwhere , denotes the MRC coefficients. Then, the\nsingle-tap equalizers, e.g., zero-forcing (ZF) or minimum\nmean-square error (MMSE) [24], can be employed for the\nchannel equalization. These equalizers do not affect the SNR\nof the received symbols. The symbol detection performance\nis related to the effective SNR (denoted by ) for the MRC\n[25], i.e.,\n(6)\nFor the -ary quadrature-amplitude-modulation (QAM), the\nsymbol-error-rate (SER) (denoted by ) for the th element\nof is tightly upper-bounded by [24]\n(7)\nwhere is the Gaussian Q-function.\nC. The AF Protocol\nIn the AF protocol, the relay forwards all received noisy sym-\nbols with power re-allocation. Hence, the AF relay relates the\noutput to as below\n(8)\n(9)\nwhere denotes the amplifying coefficients. We can plug (9)\ninto (3) and obtain\n(10)\nThe following operation is performed on to unify the noise\nvariance to :\n(11)\nThe destination can perform the MRC on and . The\neffective SNR can be calculated as\n(12)\nThe SER for each subcarrier is tightly upper-bounded by (7).\nD. Margin-Adaptive BPL for SD Communication\nThe margin-adaptive approach for the single-antenna single-\nlink OFDM communications can be found in many literatures,\ne.g., Chow\u2019s algorithm and Levin-Campello algorithm [11]. The\nbasic structure can be described as follows [13]. Consider to\nbe the target SER on the th subcarrier.1 Loading the amount of\nbits on the th subcarrier with -QAM ( ) needs\nthe target SNR (denoted by ) as [derived from (7)]\n(13)\n1Similar to the consideration in [13], we also fix the target SER \u0000 for each\nsubcarrier. Certainly, the target SER could be different for each subcarrier, i.e.,\n\u0000 and \u0000 \u0000 \u0002\u0003\u0000\u0002\u0004 \u0000 . However, it can be easily justified that the\nlater one offers larger block-error-rate than the considered target-SER setup.\nTherefore, the considered target-SER is important when the ARQ scheme re-\nquires retransmission of the whole block.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Restrictions apply. \nMA et al.: BPL FOR OFDM-BASED THREE-NODE RELAYING COMMUNICATIONS 3239\nThe BPL algorithm aims to minimize the total power cost for a\nsystem that transmits at a rate of bits per block and achieves\nthe target SER, . This can be realized by minimizing the La-\ngrangian\n(14)\nwhere is the transmit-power on the th subcarrier, and the\nLagrangian multiplier for the constraint .\nIt can be shown that is a convex and increasing function of\n. Thus, (14) can lead to the following BPL algorithm.\nInitialization:\nFor all , let (iteration index), ,\n, ;\nBit-loading iterations:\nRepeat the following times:\n;\n;\n;\n;\nEnd.\nCioffi has mentioned in [11] that this is the best design for\nmany transmission systems such as high data rate real-time\ncommunications, where variable data rate is not desirable.\nMoreover, our performance investigation is focused on the\naverage power-consumption per bit. Then, the margin-adaptive\napproach can easily enable the fair comparison between the\nadaptive transmissions and the nonadaptive transmissions.\nIII. BPL FOR THE SLS-DF PROTOCOL\nIn this section, we investigate the BPL approach for both the\nideal SLS-DF protocol and the outage SLS-DF protocol. Al-\nthough the ideal SLS-DF protocol cannot be practically imple-\nmented, we can use it for the performance comparison with the\noutage SLS-DF protocol.\nA. Ideal SLS-DF Protocol\nEquations (5) and (6) indicate that the effective SNR for each\nsubcarrier depends on whether the relay detects the symbol cor-\nrectly. If the relay receives the correct symbol, which happens\nwith probability , then the effective SNR for the th\nsubcarrier is . Otherwise, the ef-\nfective SNR is the SNR for the SD channel, i.e., .\nHence, the SER at the destination is tightly upper bounded by\n(15)\nBased on the fact , we can further obtain the\nfollowing upper bound:\n(16)\nA sufficient condition for the target SER to be achieved is for\nthe upper bound in (16) to be no larger than the target SER, .\nA sufficient condition for that to happen is\n(17)\n(18)\nWe can see that the left hand of (18) (i.e., ) is a\nmonotonically decreasing function of the source power .\nTherefore, the minimum of source power (denoted by )\nis unique, and can be found by employing the line search\nmethod [26]. For example, we can first use the Chernoff bound\n[24] to derive the following inequality:\n(19)\nBased on (18) and (19), we can easily find the following result:\n(20)\nThen, the line search can be carried out within this range. When\nthe source power is determined, we can use (17) to obtain\nthe relay power (22). To help our further investigation, we sum-\nmarize the above results as below.\nTheorem 1: Given the target SER, , and the number of\nbits\/symbol, , a sufficient condition on the distributed power\nallocation on the th subcarrier for the target SER to be satis-\nfied is\n(21)\n(22)\nNext, our objective is to minimize the power sum\nfor the th subcarrier. This issue will be carefully investi-\ngated for both the FLPR and the FIPR scenarios.\n1) The FLPR Strategy: This strategy is used to minimize\nthe power sum for the scenarios without individual local\npower constraint. We can first set the transmit-power ,\nto the lower bound for (21) and (22). According to Theorem\n1, this power allocation can achieve the target SER. Then,\nwe increase the source power with the difference , i.e.,\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on February 16,2010 at 12:00:13 EST from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \n3240 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOL. 56, NO. 7, JULY 2008\n. The lower bound for (22) indicates\nthat the required relay power is reduced with the difference\n. Then, the total power change\nfor the th subcarrier is\n(23)\nHence, the total power consumption for the th subcarrier can\nbe reduced (i.e., ) with increasing the source power\nonly for the case . In this case, the source should\npay all power cost for this subcarrier. For the case of\n, we should keep the initial power allocation, i.e.,\n. For the special case , we suggest the source\npay all power cost. This can increase the SD link reliability. As a\nconclusion, the above statements can be summarized as below.\nCorollary 1.1: Given the sufficient condition (21) and (22),\nfor the case , the power sum is minimized\nwith the following distributed power allocation:\n(24)\nOtherwise, the power sum is minimized by employing the\nlower bound for (21) and (22).\n2) The FIPR Strategy: In many cases, the distributed senders\nhave their individual power constraint. Usually, this power con-\nstraint does not support the FLPR strategy. In this scenario, we\ncan fix the power ratio for each subcarrier, i.e.,\n, where , denotes the power constraint\nfor the relay and the source, respectively. This is a sufficient\ncondition for the relay\/source power balancing required, and the\nextra (subcarrier) constraint is for analytic simplicity.\nCorollary 1.2: Given the sufficient condition (21) and (22)\nand the fixed power ratio, , the minimum of total transmit-\npower for the th subcarrier is\n(25)\nwhere\n(26)\nThe proof for this result is simple. We can first replace\nwith in (22) to obtain another lower bound for the source\npower (i.e., the second term at the right hand of (26)). As shown\nin (26), the source power should be the maximum of two lower\nbounds.\nB. Outage SLS-DF Protocol\nIn this protocol, the relay can measure the received SNR for\neach subcarrier. When the received SNR is smaller than the SNR\nthreshold2 (i.e., ), the relay does not transmit the\nreceived symbols on the th subcarrier. In this case, the SER at\nthe destination is . Otherwise, the relay transmits\nthe received symbols on the th subcarrier. Then, the SER at\nthe destination is expressible as\n(27)\nwhere denotes the SER at the relay for ,\nand the SER for the MRC in the presence of\nerror propagation. Based on the fact and\n, (27) is upper bounded by\n(28)\nAs a summary of the above discussions, the SER at the destina-\ntion can be upper bounded by\n(29)\nwhere is binary, i.e.,\n;\n.\n(30)\nA sufficient condition for the target SER to be achieved is for\nthe upper bound in (29) to be no larger than the target SER,\n. For the case of , a sufficient condition for that to\nhappen is: C1) ; C2) .\nThe condition C1) leads to the result (22). Based on the fact\n(31)\nthe following condition is demanded for protecting the condition\nC2), i.e.,\n(32)\nWe can replace in (32) with the SNR\nand obtain the following result:\n(33)\nAs a conclusion, we can summarize the above discussions as\nbelow.\nTheorem 2: Given the target SER, , and the number of bits\/\nsymbol, , for the case , a sufficient condition on the\ndistributed power allocation on the th subcarrier for the target\nSER to be satisfied is (22) and (33).\n2The SNR threshold \u0000 can be different with respect to the modulation\norder.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

To protect this case, the\ncondition (33) needs to be satisfied. However, the case\nwill happen under the following condition:\n(34)\nIn this case, the relay does not transmit on the th subcar-\nrier, i.e., . The source should guarantee the condition\n, which results in\n(35)\nThe conditions (34) and (35) can lead to the following results:\n(36)\nWe can easily justify that the right hand of (36) is very close to\n1 for the target SER . Moreover, Corollary 1.1\nshows that the source should pay all power cost under the con-\ndition . This statement is derived from the con-\ndition (22), which is also valid for the outage SLS-DF protocol.\nTherefore, the FLPR strategy here should obey the following\ncriterion.\nCorollary 2.1: Given the sufficient condition (23) and (33),\nfor the channel condition (36) and , the power\nsum is minimized with the distributed power allocation as in\n(24). Otherwise, the power sum is minimized by employing\nthe lower bound for (22) and (33).\n2) The FIPR Strategy: In this scenario, we only need to con-\nsider the case . This is to protect the fixed power ratio\nfor each subcarrier. Therefore, the source power should simul-\ntaneously fulfill the condition (22) and (33). Then, the power\nallocation strategy can be described as below.\nCorollary 2.2: Given the sufficient condition (22) and (33)\nand the fixed power ratio, , the minimum of total transmit-\npower for the th subcarrier is given by (25) with\n(37)\nSo far, we have investigated the BPL criteria for the SLS-DF\nprotocols. The BPL approach can be implemented by modifying\nslightly the algorithm introduced in Section II-D.\nInitialization:\nFor all , let (iteration index), ,\n, ;\nBit-loading iterations:\nRepeat the following times:\n;\n;\n;\nAllocate between the source and relay;\n;\nEnd.\nIV.

SIMULATION RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION\nComputer simulations were used to examine the required\ntransmit-power per bit and the final SER for both the SLS-DF\nand the AF-based three-node relaying communications. The\nresults were obtained by averaging over 5 000 independent\nchannel realizations. The linear MMSE method was employed\nfor the channel equalization. Throughout the simulations, the\nBPL algorithms were optimized for the target SER .\nThen, the link performance was examined by changing the\nnoise power. The CP-OFDM system setup was given by (the\ntypical setup for HIPERLAN\/2 in [28]): subcarriers,\n8 samples in the CP. The OFDM block duration (exclusive\nCP) was 3.2 s. Each burst consisted of 64 OFDM blocks. The\ninformation-bearing bits were randomly generated independent\nand equally likely. The number of bits per OFDM block was\nbits.4 The modulation schemes were -QAM with\n, 16, 64, respectively. The channel impulse response for\neach link was generated according to the indoor channel model\nA specified by ETSI for HIPERLAN\/2 [29]. The channel gain\n(denoted by ) for each link was considered as the following\nthree cases:\nCases I, II, and III are corresponding to the scenarios: the relay\nis close to source, close to the destination, and in the middle\nbetween the source and the destination, respectively. The\nsimulations were divided into four experiments with respect to\nvarious BPL approaches and relaying protocols. We considered\ntwo baselines for the performance comparison. One was the\nnonadaptive 16QAM-OFDM relaying communication. The\nother was called the SD-adaptive case, i.e., the source per-\nformed the BPL approach based on the channel quality of the\nSD link, and sent the information in the broadcasting fashion.\nThe relay retransmitted the received symbols according to the\ncorresponding relaying protocols.\nExperiment 1 (SLS-DF, FLPR): The objective of this ex-\nperiment is to evaluate the proposed FLPR approaches for\nthe outage SLS-DF relaying protocol. The SNR threshold is\ncorresponding to the SER at relay (i.e., ). We\nfirst examine the proposed BPL approach based on the outage\nbehavior, i.e., the outage SLS (OSLS) approach addressed in\nSection III-B. Fig. 2 illustrates the SER at the destination as\na function of the total transmit-power per bit to noise. It is\nobserved that the OSLS approach can improve significantly the\n4This setup was used to offer the fair comparison with the nonadaptive\n16QAM-OFDM communications.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

A comparison amongst outage\nSLS-DF, SD adaptive only, and nonadaptive DF communications.\nSER performance or the transmit-power efficiency in compar-\nison to both baselines. Taking Case I and as an\nexample, the OSLS approach shows about 12 dB gain and 4 dB\ngain in comparison to the nonadaptive case and the SD adaptive\ncase, respectively. This result shows the significance of the\nmulti-link adaptation. Fig. 2 also reflects another interesting\nphenomenon. For the nonadaptive approach, Case II shows the\nworst performance. Cases I and III have the very close SER.\nThis is a well-known feature for the SDF relaying protocol\n[22]. It is observed that the SD-adaptive approach mitigates the\ndifference amongst three cases. This is because the source is\noptimized for the SD link, which can reduce the impact of the\nrelaying link on the final performance.\nWe then examine the proposed BPL approach originally\noptimized for the ideal SLS (ISLS) protocol. As shown in\nSection III-A, the BPL result only depends on the quality of\nrelaying channels. Therefore, the ISLS approach can also be\nemployed in the outage SLS-DF scenario. For example, the\nsource can load the power and the bits according to the ISLS\ncriterion. When the outage SLS-DF relay needs to forward the\nreceived symbol, the transmit-power should be in line with the\nISLS criterion. Fig. 3 illustrates the SER performance for both\nthe ideal SLS-DF protocol and the outage SLS-DF protocol.\nWe can see that employing the ISLS approach for the outage\nSLS-DF protocol can offer the comparable performance to that\nfor the ideal SLS-DF protocol. Although the ISLS approach is\nnot optimized for the outage SLS-DF environment, it can offer\nvery close performance to the OSLS approach.\nTo see the distributed power-consumption for the proposed\nBPL approaches, we plot the transmit-power ratio in Fig. 4. It\nis shown that all curves generally increase with increase of the\nbit-SNR (or decrease of the noise power), i.e., the relay pays\nthe increasing power consumption. This is because the number\nof bits\/block forwarded by the relay is increased with the noise-\npower reduction. It is also observed that the transmit-power ratio\nfor the OSLS approach is smaller than that for the ISLS ap-\nproach. This means that the relay pays less power consumption\nFig. 3. SER versus total average bit SNR. A comparison amongst outage\nSLS-DF, ideal SLS-DF in ideal context, and ideal SLS-DF in outage context.\nFig. 4. Transmit Power ratio versus total average bit SNR.

Another interesting phenomenon is that\nthe relay in Case II expends less power in comparison to other\ncases. This is because the number of bits\/block forwarded by\nthe relay depends on the channel gain for the SR link.\nExperiment 2 (SLS-DF, FIPR): This experiment is used to\nevaluate the proposed FIPR approaches for the outage SLS-DF\nrelaying protocol. The transmit-power ratio between relay and\nsource is set to . Fig. 5 illustrates the SER performance for\nboth the ISLS and the OSLS approaches. In contrast to the base-\nlines in Fig. 2, we can see that the proposed approaches offer the\nsignificant performance improvement in terms of the SER or the\ntransmit-power per bit. Taking Case I and\nas an example, both the ISLS and the OSLS approaches out-\nperform the SD-adaptive approach more than 3 dB in terms\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Although the ISLS approach is originally op-\ntimized only for the ideal SLS-DF protocol, its performance in\nthe outage SLS-DF environment is also very close to that for the\nOSLS approach.\nExperiment 3 (SLS-AF, FLPR): The objective of this exper-\niment is to evaluate the proposed FLPR approach for the AF\nrelaying protocol. We first examine the final SER and the total\ntransmit-power efficiency for the proposed approach and plot\nthe results in Fig. 6. It is shown that the proposed approach\ncan significantly improve the SER performance or the transmit-\npower efficiency. For example Case I and ,\nthe proposed approach shows around 3 dB and 11 dB gain in\ncomparison with the SD-adaptive approach and the nonadap-\ntive approach, respectively. As for the nonadaptive approach,\nthe transmit-power efficiency for the proposed approach can be\nfurther improved when the relay is placed close to the desti-\nnation (i.e., Case II) or in the middle between the source and\nthe destination (i.e., Case III). However, the performance dif-\nference between Case II and Case III is not considerable. We\nthen plot the transmit-power ratio in Fig. 7 to examine the dis-\ntributed power consumption. It is shown that the transmit-power\nratio is almost identical for Cases I and III. The relay in Case II\nexpends less power. It is also observed that all curves generally\nincrease with increase of the bit-SNR (or decrease of the noise\npower). This is because the transmit-power ratio for the AF pro-\ntocol is given by . Obvioursly, the\nreduction of noise power can result in the increase of .\nExperiment 4 (SLS-AF, FIPR): This experiment is used\nto evaluate the proposed FIPR approach for the AF-re-\nlaying protocol in the local-resource-restriction context.

The results show that\nthe proposed approach offers the considerable performance\nimprovement in terms of the SER or the total transmit-power\nefficiency.

The performance improvement becomes\nmore large for Case II (about 2.5 dB) and Case III (about\n3.5 dB).\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have investigated the margin-adaptive ap-\nproaches for the OFDM-based three-node relaying communi-\ncations, where the orthogonal half-duplex relay could use either\nthe SLS-DF or the AF relaying protocol to retransmit the in-\nformation. The MRC has been employed at the destination to\nattain the achievable link performance. With respect to various\npower-consumption conditions, the proposed approaches have\nbeen carefully designed for both the FLPR and the FIPR con-\ntexts. Specifically, two BPL approaches, i.e., the ISLS approach\nand the OSLS approach, have been proposed for the SLS-DF\nprotocols. The ISLS approach was based on the assumption that\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on February 16,2010 at 12:00:13 EST from IEEE Xplore.
