Many authors have attempted to make inferences on early Earth models \nbased on modern processes which can be increasingly well constrained. In this short review I show how we are \nbeginning to understand and quantify inputs to modern subduction systems and I pose some questions as to how \nthese processes may have affected Earth\u2019s evolution in its distant past. \nGeochemical models have convincingly demonstrated that sediment and altered oceanic crust must be recycled \ninto the mantle through subduction zones. These \u2018subduction factories\u2019 use these components, along with molten \nmantle, to create arc magmas. The \u2018residue\u2019 from this process is recycled into the mantle and has a modified \nchemical and mineralogical composition. The altered oceanic crust input function in the current plate tectonic cycle \nseems to be relatively constant in composition, but the chemical compositions of the sediment fluxes into \nsubduction zones vary widely and control many of the end-member compositions of arc magmas. They must also \ncontrol the compositions of fluids and gases derived from these magmas and ultimately ore-deposition and \natmospheric fluxes associated with arc volcanoes. \nThere is relatively strong evidence for subduction processes for at least the past 3.5 Ma and some would argue \nthat exogenic components have been recycled into the mantle since at least ~4.3 Ma. How might the subduction \nfluxes have changed through time, and how might they have influenced crust, ocean and atmospheric compositions? \nCan different ore regimes in temporal and spatial distribution on Earth be related to the change in inputs and \nresidues from the subduction factory through time? \nIntroduction \n It is generally accepted that the subduction zones of the planet are the main focus of recycling material back \ninto the mantle and also of stabilization and creation of continental crust (e.g., Armstrong, 1968, 1991; VonHuene \nand Scholl, 1991; Plank and Langmuir, 1998). Geochemical tracers of various kinds have been used to model this \nprocess through the history of Earth. There is still considerable discussion on when plate tectonics started. What was \nrecycled? How much crust was created and destroyed at different time intervals throughout the Earth? How may this \nhave influenced the composition of the crust, mantle, ocean, and atmosphere? \nIn this short paper I do not intend to answer all of these problems, but I will focus on how we are beginning to \nconstrain and understand modern subduction cycles, and how some of the different input functions that we can now \nobserve must have changed and most probably influenced key geochemical processes on Earth. \n1.1 Fluxes at subduction zones \nFigure 1 (Anbar and Rouxel, 2007) provides a schematic view of the sequence from the production of oceanic \ncrust at ridges to its subduction in convergent margins. The ocean crust matures through cooling and interaction with \nsea-water and also through hydrothermal exchange with cooling magma bodies in the deep ocean crust. These \nprocesses change its composition and also the global composition of sea-water. It was recognized relatively early \nafter the discovery of hydrothermal systems that the global balance of major elements such as Ca and Mg were \ncontrolled in part through hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust (Mottl and Wheat, 1994). \n \nFig. 1. Inputs into the subduction factory from altered oceanic crust and entrained sediments. Adapted from \nAnbar and Rouxel (2007). \n  \nThe carbon budget is also controlled in part by the exchange of warmed sea-water with oceanic crust (Alt and \nTeagle, 1999), as are some of the key trace elements (K, U, and Pb) that control the isotopic evolution of the planet \n(Staudigel and Hart, 1983). Apart from the odd serendipitous discovery of hydrothermally altered crust exposed in \nfractures zones in the oceanic crust, the only systematic sampling of oceanic crust to study these budgets has been \nthrough oceanic drilling by ODP and IODP. \nIn addition to altered oceanic crust, the other important input flux to the subduction system is sediment that has \naccumulated on the crust since its creation at the ridge axis. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, this sediment is trapped in \nthe subducting wedge and some of it contributes to the creation of the accretionary prism and is scraped off during \nsubduction, as is often the case for the upper part of the oceanic basement (Kimura and Ludden, 1995). Nonetheless, \nthe composition of volcanic rocks extruded in volcanic arc systems clearly indicates that some of these sediments \nare entrained into the mantle and participate in the melting process that produces magmas in arcs (Plank and \nLangmuir, 1993). Models defining the amount of sediment involved in this process vary widely, but even \nconservative estimates may place 2% subducted sediment as a component in magmas and, depending on the \ncomposition of the sediment, this may strongly influence the magma composition. Whole mantle models using \ntracers sensitive to sediment addition, such as Hf isotopes (Blichert-Toft et al., 1999) also indicate that sediment is \n mixed back into the mantle during this process. \nThe sediments that can be introduced into the \u2018subduction factory\u2019, as it has been termed, vary widely in \ncomposition, from purely ocean or hydrothermal derived chemical or organic precipitates, through volcanogenic \nsediment sloughed off volcanic seamounts, volcanic ash from the subduction systems themselves, to water- and air-\nborne terrigenous sediments. The only means of defining these sedimentary assemblages has been through drilling \ntype sections close to subduction zones, and IODP has done this on a number of occasions. In some cases sampling \nwas done with the expressed aim of characterizing the full subduction assemblage (Legs 123, 185). In Leg 185, we \nwent as far as developing composite samples that can be used as a reference for modeling the fluxes in the \nsubduction factory (Kelley et al., 2005). \nTwo relatively simple models indicate the importance of this process in the control of magma and mantle \ncompositions: \n1.2.1 The U\/Pb ratio of altered recycled basaltic oceanic crust \nFigure 2a (Kelley et al., 2003) shows that as the oceanic crust ages and interacts with sea-water and is \noxidized, its U content increases. The original composition of U in the crust is about 0.2 ppm and with oxidation \nincreases can be greater than ten-fold. The enhanced values are located at the top of the section where oxidation is \nmost pervasive as well as in localized alteration zones through the crust. One of the challenges is estimating the \nbulk composition of elements such as U in the oceanic crust, and Kelley et al. (2005) have attempted this by using \ngamma logs and also discrete samples. Estimates of the altered crust are about 0.4 ppm and unaltered glass at 0.08 \nppm. The U\/Pb ratio of altered crust is thus increased by alteration processes. As shown in Fig. 2b, U and Pb are \nlost at different stages in the subduction process due to difference in their partition coefficients. Interestingly, as \nmodeled by Kelley et al. (2005), all of the lavas of the Honshu-Izu-Mariana system align along mixing lines which \ndefine a Pb\/U ratio of 30 and reflect an eight-fold enrichment of Pb over U in the fluids derived from the subducted \nslab (Fig. 2b?). The residue is thus an altered oceanic crust which will transform to eclogite on, and sink into, the \nmantle and will have a very high U\/Pb ratio that through time will generate a highly radiogenic mantle component. \nThis component was proposed by Hofman and White (1982) to be the end member for high U\/Pb mantle sources \n(the HiMU source). The results from Kelley were the first to provide a firm estimate of the input function to the \nsubduction zone. \n \nFig. 2. (a) Down-hole distribution of U based on gamma log data and also from discrete sampled and composite \nmixed samples (from Kelley et al., 2003). (b) Pb\/U and Th\/U ratios in arc systems from the west Pacific illustrating \ncontrol by altered crust derived fluids (from Kelley et al., 2005). (c) Modelled fluxes of U and Pb in the zone system \nindicating differential U and Pb loss. The heavy black line traces slab losses at preferred growth rates. Yellow zones \n indicate maximum possible losses (from Kelley et al., 2005). (  \n \n1.2.2 Sediment input into the subduction system \nAs demonstrated by Plank and Langmuir (1998) the composition of sediment input into subduction systems \nvaries dramatically across the planet and as such different arc-systems are \u2018fed\u2019 by quite different sedimentary \nproducts with different geochemistry and mineralogy. One of the early demonstrations of the control of sedimentary \n input into arc systems was by White and Dupre (1986) where in the Lesser Antilles the influence of highly \nradiogenic Precambrian sedimentary rocks derived from the Archaean crust of northern South America diminishes \nfrom north to south up along the arc and the output from the volcanic systems varies congruently with the subducted \nsedimentary input. This demonstration was quantitative and it is only recently through drilling complete oceanic \nsections ocean-ward of arc systems that we have been able to constrain the process a little better. As for the \ndemonstration above for U\/Pb in altered oceanic crust, the first quantitative attempts to measure fluxes were the \nobjective of ODP Leg 185 which drilled a series of holes ocean-ward of the Izu-Mariana arc (Ludden et al., 2006). \n \nFig. 3. (a) Th\/La ratios of sediments from three West Pacific locations ocean-ward of the Honshu-Izu-Mariana arc \nsystem. (b) Mixing trends between mantle sources and subducted sediments for the Honshu-Izu-Mariana system \n(from Plank et al., 2007).  \n \n  \n From north to south, from Honshu, through the Izu Bonnin Arc to the Marianas, the sedimentary assemblage is \ndefined broadly by three components, each having a range in compositions: terrigenous components (wind derived, \ncarried by ocean currents, etc.); authigenic sediments from the oceans (chemical and biological sediments); \nvolcanogenic sediments derived locally from the arc, but also from volcanic seamounts on the oceanic plate. The \nproportions of these sediments vary along the arc and reflect different wind conditions (continental detritus blown in \nfrom Asia), different authigenic components (controlled by water depth, composition, compensation depths, \nhydrothermal sources, etc.) and also volcanogenic inputs from intra-plate volcanoes and also from the arcs \nthemselves. \nFigure 3a is taken from Plank et al. (2007). It defines the Th\/La ratio in sediments in three ocean floor sections \nfor three arcs in the West Pacific. The compositions of the volcanic products in the arcs (Fig. 3b) show well defined \nmixing trends from the mantle source to the sediment input composition in each arc. Honshu is the closest to the \nAsian dust input and thus has the highest Th\/La ratio while the Mariana arc is dominated by sediments derived from \nvolcanogenic components with a bulk composition near to that of the mantle. \nThese results for the West Pacific arc confirm the early inferences by White and Dupre, (1986) for the Antilles \narc but allow geochemists to begin to better quantify the inputs to the subduction systems. \nOver the past 10 years geochemists have thus started to place quantitative constraints on processes in arc \nsystems. This is largely due to higher quality trace element geochemistry, but also a better understandings of \npartition coefficients for key elements (Hawkesworth et al., 1997) and also phase transitions during subduction \nprocesses. Furthermore, geophysicists are able to provide much better images of oceanic plates in the subduction \nsystem (Abers et al., 2006), allowing geologists to tie together structural, thermal, and chemical regimes in the \nsubduction system. \nHow may these processes have worked in the earliest periods of Earth\u2019s evolution? \n \n2. Subduction zones in the early Earth \nI do not intend to cover all of the discussion on how and when subduction started on the Earth. There have been \nnumerous articles written on the subject and academics will continue to fill journal pages with arguments on the \nsubject. Suffice it to say that the results of the Canadian LITHOPROBE project have provided convincing \narguments for subduction related processes and images of potential fossil subduction systems potentially as old as \n3600 Ma (Cook et al., 1998), but certainly well and truly active by about 3000 Ma (Kimura et al, 1993). Figure 4 \nshows a seismic reflection image which has been interpreted as a fossil subduction zone. In this zone, Archaean \ngreenstone assemblages (volcanic and sedimentary rocks) are thrust subducted below a plutonic complex \u2013 the \n Opatica plutonic complex, which can be traced across the Superior Province of Canada and reflects an ancient \nsubduction system that was active at about 2800 Ma to 2700 Ma (Ludden and Hynes, 2000). \n \nFig. 4. A seismic reflection image which has been interpreted as an Archaean fossil subduction zone. Modified from \nCalvert et al. (1995). \n \n \nGeochemical and mineralogical data has been obtained from some of the oldest preserved minerals on Earth. \nZircons preserved in younger sediments have been dated from as early as 4.3 Ga (Harrison et al., 2005) and show \ncharacteristics which indicate an exogenic origin prior to their inclusion in Hadean plutonic rocks. Thus, there is \nrelatively good evidence that sediments and altered materials from the surface of the Earth may have been recycled \ninto the mantle since 4000 Ma and perhaps before. \nWhat was the chemistry of the altered oceanic crust and sediments that was subducted? How might this have \n reacted in the subduction zone? What would the consequences be for the mantle, arc volcanoes, and the atmosphere \nand oceans? \n3. How the geochemical recycling process may have changed through time \nAltered oceanic crust and the sediments carried into the subduction factory strongly influence numerous \ngeochemical processes on Earth. I have addressed above some of the questions as to when did we start recycling \naltered oceanic crust and sediment into the mantle by subduction. Below, I speculate on some consequences of \nchanging subduction regimes through time. There are numerous examples, some are highly speculative, but there is \na renewed interest in early Earth processes due to our abilities to apply new geochemical tracers to the early Earth \n(Anbar and Rouxel, 2007) and I hope we will soon be able to apply firm constraints to some of the speculations \nbelow. \nSome authors (Francis et al., 1999) would argue that basaltic crust was richer in iron in the early Earth. This \ncould be due to a less oxidized mantle source which had yet to be oxidized by extensive subduction of volatiles back \ninto the mantle. It could also be because the mantle itself generated more Fe-rich magmas from a mantle source that \nwas different from that now forming at mid-ocean ridge axes. \nHigh-Fe basalt mixed back into the mantle in the early Earth may now provide the source for some mantle \nplume magmas that are also rich in iron, and may not have a peridotitic mantle source, but rather a pyroxene \ndominated mantle source (Francis, 1995). \nAlthough most arc-related magmas seem to be related to devolatilisation of the subducting plate, it is possible \nthat the basaltic plate itself melts to generate andesitic magmas. Certain authors argue that adakite magma is formed \nthis way in hot subduction zones in the modern Earth (Martin et al., 2005) and also argue that basaltic plate melting \nwould have predominated in subduction processes in the early Earth, generating andesite, rather than basalt, as is the \ncase in most modern subduction systems (Martin, 1987). This may be why the composition of andesite-dacite \nsystems in the Archaean have high LREE\/HREE ratios because the REE would have been fractionated by garnet-\nrich eclogitic residues. The average composition of the crust generated in Archaean subduction systems may have \nbeen generally more andesitic (Rudnick and Gao, 2003) \nOxidized upper oceanic crust in the early Earth may not have been enriched in U and K, as is the case now, and \nthese elements may have had completely different controls in early Earth mantle processes. Uranium was not \nreleased from the crust until the Mesoproterozoic oxidation and the complete crust-mantle cycle of U would have \nbeen different to that after the Neoproterozoic. High U\/Pb mantle sources may not have been formed until the \nProterozoic. Indeed, they may have been formed preferentially in the Proterozoic when large quantities of Fe, U, and \n other elements susceptible to oxidation (e.g., molybdenum\u2013Anbar and Rouxel, 2007) were sequestered on the ocean \nfloor and thus made available for input to the subduction factories of the Proterozoic. \nBase metal ore deposits do not seem to differ greatly in the mid- and late-Archaean from those now being \nformed in arc and ocean floor systems. The process of hot sea-water interaction with basaltic crust may not have \nchanged dramatically through time, but the trace elements often associated with these deposits and often \nfocused in subduction related ore-systems (Au, Pb, Mo, Sn, etc.) must have been influenced by the volatile \nfluxes in subduction systems. These must have been subject to different source compositions in the dewatering \noceanic crust and sediments. One cannot help but imagine that the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic regions with \nhigh metal concentrations \u2013 the Proterozoic metal provinces, the west Pacific high-Au regions, the Bathurst Au \ncamp \u2013 are related to inherited concentration processes in subduction systems that are atypical. \nCarbonate fluxes into subduction systems must be related to precipitation processes on the sea-floor. We \nknow, as shown in this article, that latitude influences carbonate accumulation on the sea-floor. Carbonate fluxes \nin the early Earth are related to abiotic carbonate fluxes, probably linked to metamorphic fluxes in the continental \nand ocean crust (Groves et al., 1988). \nPhosphate and REE budgets in subduction zones now appear to be controlled by pelagic sediments deposited \nslowly on the sea-floor and taken into the subduction zones. Is the phosphorous budget of the mantle controlled in \nsome way through subduction? Are some of the extreme magmas from the mantle, such as carbonatites, related to \ncalcite and phosphorous injected back into the mantle \u2013 C and P that would relate to biological activity and reappear \nat the Earth\u2019s surface in magmatic systems? \nCarbonate deposition predominates in cold water oceans. Plate configurations in which generally east-west \nsubduction systems in cooler oceans, rather than longitudinal systems in temperate oceans, may result in a \nsignificant increase of the CO2 flux into the subduction system and thus more CO2 feed-back to the atmosphere and \nassociated consequences for global change. This paper probably does not have a clear place in a journal such as \nApplied Geochemistry. It was solicited as part of a series of papers presented by the past presidents of the IAGC.  \nApplied Geochemistry and the IAGC have developed a strong symbiotic relationship. This paper not only spreads \nacross the bounds of geochemistry, it also covers Earth\u2019s history and the range in processes in the subduction \nsystem. It is impossible in a short paper to do justice to the problem. Suffice it to say that some of the geochemical \nfluxes of the Earth have important applied consequences and these are commonly not analyzed in the specialist \nliterature. The changing oxidation state of the planet and the associated sediment flux to the sea-floor and into the \nsubduction system, and ultimately the deep mantle, must have played a major role on chalcophile element fluxes and \nin ore deposit generation associated with subduction zone magmas. The U-cycle from the Neoproterozoic onward \nmust have a control in subduction and erosion processes. The carbonate flux into subduction zones since the \n Paleozoic, and before, must depend on the global orientation of the subduction systems relative to the North and \nSouth Pole and hence the amount of carbonate precipitated on the sea-floor. The carbonate soaked up by ocean crust \nmust also provide a strong constraint on the process of carbon capture and sequestration in minerals. \nAlthough there are no new data in this paper, I hope the combination of geoscience subject matter has \nprovided the reader with a \u2018few things to scratch their head over\u2019 and some of the implications for applied \ngeochemistry are apparent. \nAcknowledgements \nI have worked with many scientists on the broad subjects outlined above, I thank them all.
