The gas in these regions can\nthus cool and recombine, initiating a cooling flow (Fabian &\nNulsen 1977; Cowie & Binney 1977). The ultimate fate of\nthis cooling gas has been the subject of an extensive and\nstrongly contested debate (see Fabian 1994). The cold gas\nhas not been detected in molecular form and so is inferred\nto reside in a phase with Tgas << 100k. Calculations of the\ngas properties are consistent with current observed limits\n(Ferland, Fabian & Johnstone 1994).\nUntil recently, the only cooling flow known to contain\nmolecular gas was that around NGC 1275 in Perseus (see\nBridges & Irwin 1998), although the interpretation of this\nsource is complicated by the strongly varying nuclear com-\nponent. Moreover, the presence of the molecular gas may be\nrelated to the apparently on-going merger in this system,\nwhich has been the subject of a long-running debate (Van\nden Bergh 1977; Hu et al. 1983; Pedlar et al. 1990; Holtz-\nman et al. 1992; Norgaard-Nielsen et al. 1993). Another ob-\nservational window on molecular hydrogen lies in the near-\ninfrared where a number of strong rovibrational lines fall in\nthe K-band. These lines have been detected in 8 different\ncooling flow central cluster galaxies (Jaffe & Bremer 1997;\nFalcke et al. 1998; Krabbe et al. 2000; Wilman et al. 2000;\nand Jaffe, Bremer & van der Werf 2001). The detection of\nmolecular gas at 1000-2500 K implies excitation is required\nand that only a very small amount of \u2018hot\u2019 molecular gas is\npresent. So there is evidence for some molecular gas in the\ncores of cooling flows but its relation to the deposited gas\npredicted from the X-ray observations is far from clear.\nThis situation has been radically altered with the de-\ntection of CO line emission in 16 central cluster galaxies\nby Edge (2001). The molecular gas masses of 109\u221211.5 M\u2299\nimply that around 2\u201310% of the total deposited gas pre-\ndicted from previous X-ray observations can be accounted\nfor directly. However, with the dramatically reduced mass\ndeposition rates found in Chandra and XMM-Newton ob-\nservations (Allen, Ettori & Fabian 2001, Schmidt, Allen &\nFabian 2001, Peterson et al. 2001), the molecular gas masses\nderived from CO observations are within a factor of three\nof that now expected. The mass of molecular gas appears\nto correlate best with the optical emission line luminosity\nindicating that the molecular gas observed is warmed from\na lower temperature. The rapid progress in this field has\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS\n2 A.C. Edge et al.\nbeen possible due to the selection of massive cooling flows\nfrom the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (see Crawford et al. 1999),\nfew of which were known before 1990. To provide a direct\ncomparison of the \u2018hot\u2019 (1000\u20132500 K) and \u2018cool\u2019 (30 K)\nmolecular gas components requires near-infrared spectra of\nthe systems that have been searched for CO.\nIn this paper we present the spectra and analysis for a\nsystematic search for near-infrared hydrogen molecular lines\nin a complete sample of strong optical emission line emitting\ncentral galaxies drawn from Crawford et al. (1999). An H\u03b1\nflux limit of > 3 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122s\u22121 was adopted to en-\nsure moderately bright lines and a redshift range of 0.03 to\n0.3 to cover at least one H2 line in the K-band. This selec-\ntion produces a sample of 18 objects reachable with UKIRT\n(one, A2146, is above the declination limit of 60\u25e6). Of this\nsample, only one object, A478, has not been observed in\nthis study but it has a published spectrum (Jaffe, Bremer &\nvan def Werf 2001). We also include seven weaker line emit-\nting or lower redshift objects from Crawford et al. (1999) to\nfully sample any potential range in recombination lines to\nmolecular line ratios, seven non-BCS central cluster galaxies\nwith strong optical emission lines drawn from the literature\n(e.g. NGC 1275, A2597 and PKS 0745\u2212191), and one con-\ntrol object with no lines (A2029) giving a total sample of 32\nspectra. We also extend our spectral coverage to [FeII] in the\nmajority of our targets making this the first comprehensive\nstudy of this line in central cluster galaxies.\nThroughout we assume \u21260 = 1 and H0 =\n50 kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121.\n2 OBSERVATIONS\nThe observations presented in this paper were taken with\nthe CGS4 spectrograph on the United Kingdom Infrared\nTelescope (UKIRT) in September 1999 and March 2000, as\nshown in the observing log in Table 1. The 256\u00d7256 InSb\narray, 40 l\/mm grating and 300 mm focal length camera\nwere used giving a spatial scale of 0.61 arcsec per pixel.\nWith a 2-pixel (1.22\u2032\u2032) wide slit this set-up achieves spectral\nresolutions of 880 and 570 km s\u22121 FWHM in the H- and\nK-bands respectively. In all but two observations, the slit\nwas oriented at a position angle of 0 degrees (north-south).\nThe NDSTARE mode was used along with the conven-\ntional object-sky-sky-object nodding pattern. Atmospheric\nabsorption features were removed by ratioing with main se-\nquence F stars and the spectra were calibrated against pho-\ntometric standards. We add in one short, archival observa-\ntion (A262, a CO detection made after our March 2000 run)\nwhich used the 75 l\/mm grating with a 1-pixel (0.61\u2032\u2032) slit at\na position angle of 2.9\u25e6. The spectra were reduced using ver-\nsion V1.3-0 of the Portable CGS4 Data Reduction package\navailable through Starlink.\n3 RESULTS\nThe individual K- and H- band spectra are presented in\nFigures 1 and 2 respectively in the order they appear in\nTable 1. The line fluxes are summarised in Table 2 in RA\norder.\nSeveral of the observations show significant extent or\nvelocity structure or were selected from the literature, so we\ndiscuss these individually here:\nA11 Selected as X-ray luminous radio galaxy by Perlman et\nal. (1998) but it is a central cluster galaxy. This galaxy was\nincluded in this study on the basis of a published spectrum\nand not on X-ray flux (which is below 3\u00d710\u221212 erg cm\u22122\ns\u22121 0.1\u20132.4 keV).\nRXJ0747-19 aka PKS 0745-191 This system has HST\nnarrow band imaging with NICMOS (Donahue et al. 2000)\nthat shows extended emission. Our CGS4 spectrum does\nnot sample the E-W extension highlighted by Donahue et\nal. (2000) but shows significant extent in both Pa\u03b1 and 1-0\nS(1) and S(3) over 5 pixels (3.0\u2032\u2032) or 8 kpc to the North,\nconsistent with the HST data. See section 4.4 for further\ndiscussion.\nRXJ0821+07 This system is highly anomalous in virtually\nevery waveband so far observed and the NIR is no excep-\ntion. A strong, velocity-offset CO detection is made in this\ncluster (Edge 2001) and the optical morphology of the cen-\ntral galaxy is very peculiar in a recent HST snapshot with\nan infalling galaxy apparently being disrupted (Bayer-Kim\net al. 2002). We made an additional CGS4 observation to\ncover the region of this infalling galaxy but made no signif-\nicant detection of any H2 lines although Pa\u03b1 was extended\nover 4 pixels (2.4\u2032\u2032) or 6 kpc to the North. The lack of NIR\nH2 emission is surprising given the strength of the CO line.\nThis could be an indication that the mechanism exciting the\nmolecular gas in RXJ0821+07 is different from that behind\nthe majority of the other detections presented here.\n4C+55.16 The central galaxy in this cluster contains a very\nstrong flat spectrum radio source so it is possible that the\nS(3) line is blended with [SiVI]. At the resolution used in\nthis work it is not possible to determine the contribution of\neach line. This cluster was included in this study on the basis\nof its known cooling flow (Iwasawa et al. 1999) and does not\nfall above the X-ray flux limit of the BCS and hence not in\nthe Crawford et al. (1999) sample.\nA1068 This system is one of the strongest optical line emit-\nters in the sample. Both the Pa\u03b1 and H2 lines are extended\nto the south by 4 pixels (2.4\u2032\u2032) or 8 kpc (see section 4.4).\nA2204 The Pa\u03b1 and H2 lines are also extended to the south\nby 5 pixels (3.0\u2032\u2032) in this system but show also a velocity shift\nof +200\u2013300 km s\u22121. The [FeII] for this source is particularly\nstrong (see Section 4.2).\nZw8193 This system is the most complex spatially and in\nvelocity. From the original discovery spectrum in Allen et\nal. (1992) it was noted that the absorption and emission\nlines were not coincident in velocity. The reasons behind\nthis are evident from our CGS4 spectra which showed two\ndistinct components 3\u2032\u2032 or 12 kpc apart (but both contained\nin the INT FOS aperture) that each show lines but with\na velocity difference of 400\u2013500 km s\u22121.

(2000) and Jaffe, Bremer & van der Werf (2001). The\nline fluxes are all within <30% of those presented elsewhere\nwhen the different slit widths are taken into account (e.g.\nJaffe et al. 2001 use a slit width of 2\u2032\u2032 to 1.2\u2032\u2032 used in the\npaper). In addition, this study includes, for the first time,\ncoverage of the [FeII] line.\nIn this section we discuss the limits this dataset can\nplace on reddening, trends in the [FeII] line, detection of\nhigh ionization lines and column density constraints.\n4.1 Reddening\nOne of the most important results from the optical spec-\ntroscopy of central cluster galaxies is the significant redden-\ning of the lines (Allen et al. 1995; Crawford et al. 1999).\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nA survey of molecular hydrogen in the central galaxies of cooling flows 9\nFigure 2. H-band spectra for the sample continued.\nThe values of E(B-V) derived imply column densities of 1\u2013\n5\u00d71021 cm\u22122.\nThere are several combinations of optical and NIR lines\nthat can be used to gauge the reddening. The most straight-\nforward is H\u03b1\/Pa\u03b1. Figure 3 shows the ratio of H\u03b1\/Pa\u03b1\nwith redshift for our joint detections with Crawford et al.\n(1999). The majority of the points agree with the ratio ex-\npected from Case B recombination (Osterbrock 1989) but\nseveral outliers are obvious. The majority of the objects\nhave ratios consistent with E(B-V)< 0.1 and are consis-\ntent with the values derived from H\u03b2\/H\u03b1 ratios by Craw-\nford et al. (1999). The objects with the three lowest ratios\n(A1068, A1835 and RXJ0821+07) have high E(B-V) values\nin Crawford et al. (1999) (0.39+0.07\n\u22120.08 , 0.40\n+0.06\n\u22120.06 and 1.16\n+0.33\n\u22120.58\nrespectively) which are consistent with those implied from\nthis analysis (0.54\u00b10.02, 0.54\u00b10.03 and 0.71\u00b10.04). How-\never, there are several objects with similar values of E(B-V)\nin Crawford et al. (1999) where our estimate is substantially\nlower (e.g. A1664, 0.46+0.06\u22120.07 vs. 0.12\u00b10.05). This variation\nmay be due in part to the extent of the emission lines and\nthe fact that the optical and CGS4 spectra, while using the\nsame slit width (1.2\u2032\u2032), were not performed at the same posi-\ntion angle. Therefore there are several points (e.g. Zw8276)\nwhere the optical line is brighter by a factor of two and oth-\ners (e.g. RXJ0821+07) where the line is fainter by a factor\nof three.\nThe only other reddening diagnostic line combination\navailable within our CGS4 data are the [FeII] lines at 1.258\nand 1.644\u00b5m. We have data for two objects, Zw3146 and\nA2204, and the equivalent E(B-V) values, given the expected\nratio of 1.258\u00b5m to 1.644\u00b5m of 1.3, are <0.1 and 0.5\u00b10.3\n(as opposed to 0.2 and 0.0 in Crawford et al. 1999).\nGiven the restrictions on the current datasets it is not\npossible to make any quantitative statements about redden-\ning from our data. Future narrow-band imaging in the opti-\ncal and NIR will allow direct comparison of the H\u03b2, H\u03b1 and\nPa\u03b1 lines and enable us to derive more reliable reddening\nmaps.\n4.2 [FeII] emission\nFor the majority of our sample we have obtained data for\n[FeII]1.644\u00b5m through the redshifting of the line into the K-\nband or an H-band spectrum. Time limitations during our\nfirst run prevented all low redshift objects being observed in\nthe H-band but we have [FeII] significant detections for 12 of\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n10 A.C.

The Case B prediction of 8.153 for T=10000K from Osterbrock\n(1989) is plotted for values of reddening of E(B-V)=0.0,0.1,0.5 and 1.0.\na total of 18 objects that we have covered at the equivalent\nof rest 1.644\u00b5m (and an additional two marginal detections,\nA1795 and A2390). Most of the non-detections for [FeII] are\nfor clusters without any molecular line detection in the K-\nband.\nFrom the [FeII] data we have it appears that the\nstrength of this feature correlates with the other near-\ninfrared and optical lines but most significantly with [OI]\n6300A\u02da(Mouri et al. 1990). There are several objects where\nthe [FeII] is particularly strong (e.g. A2204 and A1068) and\nthese objects show the strongest [OI]. Therefore, these two\nlines are probably closely related in these systems. Figure 4\nshows a comparison of the fluxes of [OI] and [FeII] lines for\nthis sample.\nThere is a substantial literature on the potential origin\nof [FeII] emission in Seyfert galaxies and starbursts (Kawara,\nNishida & Taniguchi 1988, Mouri et al. 1990, Simpson et al.\n1996, Mouri, Kawara, & Taniguchi 2000) but no firm con-\nclusions have yet been drawn on the exact excitation mech-\nanism in these systems. The [FeII] and [OI] are of particular\ndiagnostic importance as they have ionization potentials of\n16.2 and 13.6eV respectively so trace regions where hydro-\ngen is partially ionized as it has a very similar ionization po-\ntential. Shocks or X-ray heating are favoured in cases where\n[FeII] is strong compared to Br\u03b3 and both these mechanisms\nmay play a role in the cooling flow systems presented here\n(see Wilman et al. 2002).\n4.3 [SiVI] and other high ionization lines\nOne of the most striking results from this study is the pres-\nence of [SiVI] and several other high ionization lines (e.g.\n[SIX], 2-1 S(3) and HeI in the wing of Pa\u03b1) in a few objects\n(Cyg-A; Wilman et al. (2000), A1068 and PKS0745-191).\nThese objects are the ones with the strongest [OIII] lines\n(e.g. all central cluster galaxies known with [OIII] brighter\nthan 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121) and most (but not all) have strong\nradio sources. The ionization potential of [SiVI] (167 eV)\nimplies the presence of a strong non-thermal source and is\nconsistent with the optical and radio observations.\nOne prediction from these observations is that high\nresolution X-ray imaging may detect the unresolved X-ray\nemission from the nucleus (as found in Hydra-A - McNa-\nmara et al. 2000). All the objects in this study with de-\ntected [SiVI] have Chandra observations and the brightest\n(NGC 1275) has a well-established nuclear detection.\nOur data are at too low a spectral resolution to deter-\nmine if the high ionization lines have a significantly different\nline width to the Paschen or molecular hydrogen lines. In ad-\ndition, we can determine no spatial differences in these lines.\nClearly higher spectral and spatial resolution data will help\ndetermine the relative importance of nuclear excitation in\ndifferent objects. The orientation of any radio jets and dust\nlanes in HST images are additional factors in determining\nwhat is illuminated and how much of it we observe.\nAs noted above, the presence of higher ionization lines\nis not necessarily related to the radio power of the cen-\ntral galaxy. A1068 is a relatively weak radio source but has\nstrong [OIII] and significant Br-\u03b3 and [Si VI].

The dotted line marks the best least-squares linear fit\n(with an index fixed at 1.0) to the data points.\nactive nuclei in central cluster galaxies are not exclusively\nradio-loud.\n4.4 Spatial and velocity structure\nA number of galaxies in this study show extended line emis-\nsion (as discussed in section 3). The four systems with the\nmost significant extents are presented in Figure 5, which\nshows the line strength of 1-0 S(1) and Pa\u03b1 with position\non the slit. Three of these four show stronger Pa\u03b1 in the\ncentre compared to 1-0 S(1), with only A2597 showing a\nconstant line ratio. This spatial variation implies that the\nexcitation of hydrogen is strongest near the nucleus of the\ngalaxy, probably due to the action of an active nucleus as\ndiscussed above. Variations in 1-0 S(1) to H\u03b1+[NII] of a\nsimilar magnitude are observed by Donahue et al. (2000) for\nA2597 and RXJ0747-19. Although the effects of dust could\nsignificantly affect the Donahue et al. (2000) ratios, it is en-\ncouraging to note that spatial variations can be extracted\nfrom HST imaging of such systems and hence the relative\nimportance of different excitation mechanisms with radius\nfrom the centre of the galaxy.\nTwo of the galaxies in this study also show significant\nvelocity structure (A2204 and Zw8193). Figure 6 shows the\nreduced 2-D frames of these objects. The velocity shear is\npresent in both the ionized and molecular gas lines in A2204\nbut is most pronounced in the 1-0 S(3) line. In Zw8193 the\nmolecular lines are weak compared to Pa\u03b1 so a direct com-\nparison of the two phases is not possible.\nThe amplitudes of these velocity shifts (>300 km s\u22121)\nare at the limit of the resolution provided by CGS4 and\nhigher resolution integral field spectroscopy has the poten-\ntial to reveal more about the properties of these systems. De-\ntermining the velocity structure of the ionized and molecular\ngas components can set stringent limits on the importance of\ngalaxy-galaxy or ICM\/radio-jet interactions in these dense\ncooling flow core regions.\n4.5 Correlation with CO-deduced molecular gas\nmass\nThe recent detection of CO in many of the targets in this sur-\nvey by Edge (2001) allows us to compare the amount of \u2018hot\u2019\n(>1000 K) to \u2018cool\u2019 (\u223c30 K) molecular hydrogen. Figure 7\nshows the luminosity of the 1-0 S(1) line (or its equivalent)\nagainst molecular hydrogen mass using data from this pa-\nper, Cygnus-A from Wilman et al. (2000) and A478 from\nJaffe et al. (2001). The luminosity is determined for the\nslit flux only so the overall normalisation of the correla-\ntion may vary for the more extended emission. There is an\napparent correlation similar to that found in Edge (2001)\nfor the luminosity of H\u03b1. To confirm the validity of these\nluminosity-luminosity correlations we calculated the Spear-\nmans rho statistic (as recommended by Feigelson & Berg\n1983) using the ASURV package for both the 1-0 S(1) and\nH\u03b1 luminosities correlated against the molecular hydrogen\nmass estimated from CO. The correlation is significant for\nCO vs. 1-0 S(1) (\u03c1=0.59, implying a probability of correla-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n12 A.C. Edge et al.\nFigure 5.

Instrumental point spread functions, as derived from contemporaneous standard star\nobservations, are marked with crosses. Where no point is plotted there is no significant detection.\ntion of > 99.5 per cent). The result for CO vs. H\u03b1 is even\nmore significant (\u03c1=0.63, so P> 99.7 per cent). This result\nimproves if Cygnus-A is removed from the analysis (\u03c1=0.72).\nAs pointed out by Feigelson & Berg (1983), flux-flux corre-\nlations are not as reliable at determining whether an under-\nlying correlation is present particularly for samples where\nmost detections are close to the detection limit (as is the\ncase in this study). We did perform flux-flux correlations\nand get significant correlations for both optical and infrared\nline correlations but only if Perseus is included. The corre-\nlations presented in Figure 7 and Figure 9 of Edge (2001)\nare significant and are not an artifact.\nIt is interesting to note the relatively low fluxes of 1-0\nS(1) and\/or S(3) in the most radio luminous objects. The\ncomparison with H\u03b1 shows the objects with powerful radio\nsources which have firm CO upper limits (e.g. Cygnus-A and\nRXJ0747-19) lie much further from the correlation between\nCO and optical line luminosity than for the luminosity of\n1-0 S(1) as a result of the much higher ratios of H\u03b1\/1-0\nS(1) found for these objects. Figure 7 demonstrates that the\ninterelation between CO and the 1-0 S(1) line may be closer\nthan that with ionized hydrogen but as yet the observational\ndatasets are not large enough or accurate enough to confirm\nthis.\nAs with the high ionization lines, the spectral resolution\nof our CGS4 data is not sufficient to obtain line widths for\nthe H2 lines so we cannot draw a direct comparison between\nthese two phases in velocity. The CO lines have widths be-\ntween 150 and 500 km s\u22121 so higher resolution near-infrared\nspectroscopy would allow the line profiles to be compared to\nestablish if cool and warm components of molecular hydro-\ngen are bound in clouds with the same velocity structure.\nIrrespective of the excitation mechanism (which are\ndealt with in more detail in Wilman et al. 2002), the re-\nsults clearly demonstrate that in the central cluster galaxies\nwithin strong cooling flows we are observing clouds of dense\nmolecular gas being warmed to produce ionized, atomic hy-\ndrogen (H\u03b1, Pa\u03b1), warm molecular hydrogen in the near-IR\nand cool molecular hydrogen via CO. The exact ratios of\nthese three phases will undoubtedly vary with viewing an-\ngle, star-formation rate and strength of any nuclear source\nbut our observations show that any deviations are not larger\nthan an order of magnitude. Therefore the scaling apparent\nin Figure 7 holds in the majority of cases with the most\ndeviant points offering the possibility to constrain the ex-\ncitation mechanisms at work. Our relative sensitivities to\nthese three phases mean that it is the H\u03b1 emission that\nis most easily detected and the CO the hardest. There is\nalso a possibility that a fourth phase, neutral, atomic hydro-\ngen visible through the 21cm line, should also be present as\nphoto-dissociation region models predict a \u2018skin\u2019 of atomic\nhydrogen (Kaufman et al. 1999).

\u2018peculiar\u2019 features of cooling flow central cluster\ngalaxies stem from the presence of cold molecular clouds.\n4.6 Comparison to starbursts and LINERS\nThe most comparable objects to the peculiar central cluster\ngalaxies studied here are starbursts as they are both known\nto harbour young stars, cold molecular gas and dust. The\ninfra-red spectroscopy of Ultraluminous Infra-red Galaxies\nby Murphy et al. (1999) shows much stronger Pa\u03b1 and Br\u03b3\nand weaker H2 lines compared to this study. In addition the\nrelatively strong [FeII] emission found in this study is not\nobserved in starbursts. The excitation temperature of the H2\nlines is similar to that found in this study and others (see\nWilman et al. 2002) but the properties of these two classes\nof objects are significantly different in the near-infrared.\nFrom the properties of the optical emission lines, cen-\ntral cluster galaxies share many properites with LINERs.\nInfra-red spectroscopy of LINERs by Larkin et al. (1998)\nfinds strong molecular lines and a small fraction with high\nionization lines so the resemblance follows into the infra-red\nas noted by Jaffe et al. (2001). This comparison also applies\nto the [FeII] strength as LINERs (unlike starbursts) strong\nin [FeII] and [OI] and weak in Br\u03b3 (Larkin et al. 1998). The\nquestion of whether the underlying excitation mechanism\nbehind both classes of object is the same is an open one.\nThe bulk of the literature on LINERs favours X-ray heating\nand\/or shocks and this is discussed further in Wilman et al.\n(2002).\n4.7 CO absorption lines\nIn a few of the lower redshift galaxies our spectra cover the\nCO stellar absorption bandhead at 2.3\u00b5m. The strength of\nthis feature should provide constraints of the relative mass\ndistribution on the underlying population of stars in the\ngalaxies. Using the definition of the CO equivalent width of\nJames & Mobasher (2000), we calculate values of 3.57, 3.27,\n3.96, 3.21, 3.33, 3.45 and 2.89nm, with errors of 0.30nm, for\nRXJ0338+096, Hydra-A, A85, A1795, A2029, A2052 and\nA2199 respectively (only the latter object is in the James\n& Mobasher (2000) sample at 3.23\u00b10.25nm so consistent\nwithin the errors). The mean equivalent width of CO of our\nseven values is 3.38nm compared to 3.35nm for the brightest\ncluster galaxies in James & Mobasher (2000) so our results\nare consistent despite the redshift distribution and resolu-\ntion of our spectra not being well suited to studying these\nlines.\n4.8 Spectral slope at 2\u00b5m\nThe K-band spectra obtained in ths study are dominated by\nthe old stellar population. However, in the case of NGC1275\nthere is a strong contribution from the active nucleus which\nshows a significant upturn at 2\u00b5m. This is in part due to\nthe presence of hot dust (Krabbe et al. 2000). To test for\nany possible non-stellar contribution to our spectra we have\ndetermined the spectral slope from 1.9 to 2.1\u00b5m (rest) for\nall spectra (excluding emission lines). The results are pre-\nsented in Figure 8 plotted against redshift. Only one other\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n16 A.C. Edge et al.\nFigure 7. The mass of molecular gas from Edge (2001) plotted against the luminosity of the H2 1-0 S(1) line (or its equivalent for higher\nredshift objects). The filled squares mark Zw7160 and Zw8197 the only CO detections by Edge (2001) without corresponding 1-0 S(1)\ndetections. The dotted line marks a linear relationship between the two properties and is not a fit to the data.\nsystem (A1068) appears to be significantly different from\nthe overall distribution (mean of 2.59 and an rms of 0.30\nexcluding NGC1275, A1068 and all the z > 0.2 objects\nwhich have weak continuum). Unlike NGC1275, A1068 does\nnot show any broad emission lines but does show evidence\nfor a strongly ionizing source ([OIII], [SiVI] and Br \u03b3) so\nthis source may host a highly obscured, radio-quiet Seyfert\nnucleus. Therefore, while the contribution from non-stellar\nsources (nuclear continuum and hot (T>> 100 K) dust) is\nsmall in the vast majority of our spectra, the spectral slope\naround 2\u00b5m is a useful diagnostic to a possible nuclear con-\ntribution.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nThe study presented in this paper confirms that there is\na remarkably good correspondance between the warm and\ncool molecular gas and ionized hydrogen in intensity for cen-\ntral galaxies in cooling flows. These components appear to\nbe common to this class of objects and indicate that sub-\nstantial masses of irradiated molecular gas lie in the centres\nof clusters. What is required now is to establish the spa-\ntial correspondance between the observed components to\nthese systems through narrow-band imaging and intergral\nfield spectroscopy.\nIn the companion paper (Wilman et al. 2002) we present\nan analysis of the likely excitation mechanisms for the molec-\nular lines observed.\nThe ultimate question of whether the total mass of cold\nmolecular clouds deposited by the cooling flow is compa-\nrable to that predicted from X-ray observations cannot be\naddressed until observations of the far-infrared lines that\nshould be emitted by the coolest clouds as they themselves\ncool.

Table of 1-0 S(1) (or equivalent) molecular line luminosities and CO-derived molecular gas masses. The 1-0 S(1) line luminosity\nis derived from either S(3) or S(5) if S(1) is not covered in the observed spectral range. The CO-derived molecular gas masses in bracketts\nare ones derived from the literature by Edge (2001). The S(1) line luminosities for A478 and Cygnus-A (asterisked) are derived from the\nline fluxes of Jaffe, Bremer & van der Werf (2001) and Wilman et al. (2000), respectively.\nBayer-Kim C.M., Crawford C.S., Allen S.W., Edge A.C.,\nFabian A.C., 2002, in preparation\nBridges, T.J., Irwin, J.A. 1998.
