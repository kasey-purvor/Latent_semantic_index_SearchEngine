In this study, we asked whether amblyopia also disrupts the ability to track a near-threshold change in the trajectory of a single target amongst multiple similar potential targets. In the first experiment, we examined the precision for detecting a deviation in the linear motion trajectory of a dot by measuring deviation thresholds as a function of the number of moving trajectories (T).

Surprisingly, for T = 1-4, thresholds were essentially identical in both eyes of the amblyopes and were similar to those of normal observers. In a second experiment, we measured the precision for detecting a deviation in the orientation of a static, bilinear \"trajectory\" by again measuring deviation thresholds (i.e., angle discrimination) as a function of the number of oriented line \"trajectories\" (T). Relative to the nonamblyopic eye, amblyopes show a marked threshold elevation for a static target when T = 1.
