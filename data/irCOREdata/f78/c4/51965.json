(2011), Sea ice production and water mass modification in the eastern Laptev Sea, J. Geophys.\nRes., 116, C05014, doi:10.1029\/2010JC006545.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Numerous coastal polynyas form every winter in all\nperipheral shelf seas of the central Arctic [Gloersen et al.,\n1992; Barber and Massom, 2007]. These coastal polynyas\n(also termed flaw polynyas when they form adjacent to\nlandfast ice), are nonlinear\u2010shaped regions of open water\nand thin ice created as offshore winds push the pack ice\naway from the coast or the landfast ice edge [Smith et al.,\n1990; Morales Maqueda et al., 2004]. Surface heat loss\nwithin a coastal polynya results in the formation of frazil ice\nthat is transported toward the downwind edge of the\npolynya. The frazil ice arriving at the polynya edge forms a\nthin layer of ice and water slurry called grease ice [Martin\nand Kauffman, 1981] which thickens and eventually con-\nsolidates as it drifts further offshore. Salt, excluded from the\nalmost pure ice matrix, is first concentrated in the brine\nsituated between the ice crystals. This brine convects as\nplumes\/streamers into the seawater on which the ice floats.\nThe process induces haline convection and erodes the den-\nsity stratification of the water column [Ivanov and Golovin,\n2007]. If haline convection is penetrative, dense bottom\nwater may be formed [Backhaus et al., 1997]. Density\u2010\ndriven vertical mixing in coastal polynyas is a key control\nof the shelf sea dynamics since it affects momentum, heat\nand biogeochemical air\u2010sea fluxes [Morales Maqueda et\nal., 2004], and provides conditions for downslope trans-\nport of water, sediments and pollutants [Reimnitz et al.,\n1994; Sherwood, 2000; Smedsrud, 2004].\n[3] In terms of ice production and polynya\u2010induced for-\nmation of higher saline water, the Laptev Sea is a contro-\nversially discussed circum\u2010Arctic shelf sea [Zakharov,\n1966; Cavalieri and Martin, 1994; Dethleff et al., 1998;\n1Department of Sea Ice Physics, Alfred Wegener Institute,\nBremerhaven, Germany.\n2Department of Observational Oceanography, Alfred Wegener Institute,\nBremerhaven, Germany.\n3Department of Environmental Meteorology, University of Trier, Trier,\nGermany.\n4National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool, UK.\n5Microwave and Radar Institute, German Aerospace Center, Wesseling,\nGermany.\n6Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences, University of Kiel, Kiel,\nGermany.\n7Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Alberta,\nEdmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n8Institute of Geophysics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.\nCopyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/11\/2010JC006545\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 116, C05014, doi:10.1029\/2010JC006545, 2011\nC05014 1 of 17\nDmitrenko et al., 2005, 2009; Willmes et al., 2011; Dethleff,\n2010]. Constant offshore winds generate a quasi\u2010perennial\nflaw polynya extending almost 2000 km along the shelf and\nlandfast sea ice several hundreds of kilometers wide. Fol-\nlowing Zakharov [1966], the prominent flaw polynyas in the\nLaptev Sea are the New Siberian polynya (NS), the western\nNew Siberian polynya (WNS), the Anabar\u2010Lena polynya\n(AL), the Taymyr polynya (T), the northeastern Taymyr\npolynya (NET), and the eastern Severnaya Zemlya polynya\n(ESZ, compare Figure 1). According to calculations made\nby Aagaard et al. [1985] and Dmitrenko et al. [2009], the\nannual net sea ice production in the entire Laptev Sea\namounts to roughly 900 km3.\n[4] Following Dethleff et al. [1998], who investigated ice\nformation in Laptev Sea polynyas by means of a model\napplied to calculate ocean\u2010to\u2010atmosphere heat flux and the\nresulting new ice formation over open water, as much as\n258 km3 of ice is produced in polynyas. Putting the results\nof Dethleff et al. [1998] in relation to the annual ice pro-\nduction estimated by Dmitrenko et al. [2009], flaw polynyas\nproduce about 26% of the annual Laptev Sea ice. The\naverage annual polynya ice production calculated by Winsor\nand Bjoerk [2000] is far lower. The authors investigated\nArctic polynyas during 39 winter seasons from 1958 to 1997\nby means of a large\u2010scale polynya model and calculated an\naverage annual ice production of 43 km3 (4.3% of the\nannual ice production). Findings made by Willmes et al.\n[2011] are somewhat similar to what is suggested by\nWinsor and Bjoerk [2000]. According to their satellite\u2010based\nestimates, the annual polynya ice production amounts to\n5.5% (55 km3) of the total seasonal ice production and is\nhence significantly smaller than approximations made by\nDethleff et al. [1998]. The large discrepancies that exist in\nthe estimated contribution of Laptev Sea polynyas to the\nannual net sea ice formation are a consequence of the use of\ndifferent sensor systems, models, observation periods and\nalternating definitions for the term \u201cactive polynya\u201d [Krumpen\net al., 2011a].\n[5] Potential sites for dense water formation are located in\nthe central and northwestern Laptev Sea [Willmes et al.,\n2011; Dethleff, 2010]. Dense water formed in these polynyas\nis believed to feed the Arctic halocline but is found to be\ninsufficiently dense to ventilate the layers below [Schauer\net al., 1997; Lenn et al., 2008].\n[6] In the eastern Laptev Sea and the area around the WNS\npolynya (Figure 1), the large summer runoff of the Lena river\nfreshens the surface ocean layer and leads to the develop-\nment of a distinct vertical density gradient in the water\ncolumn [Dmitrenko et al., 2005]. The strength of the strat-\nification is controlled by the atmospheric circulation during\nsummer months [Dmitrenko et al., 2008]. Anticyclonic wind\nconditions force the riverine water northward and result in a\nstronger density stratification in the eastern Laptev sea.\nCyclonic atmospheric circulation deflects the freshwater\nFigure 1. Map of the Laptev Sea showing the three distinct sea ice components: the fast ice zone, the\npack ice zone, and the location of the flaw polynyas. The mean lateral extent of the fast ice at the end of\nthe winter is indicated by the black dashed line. The grey shaded area north of the fast ice represents the\npack ice zone. Between pack ice and fast ice edge, flaw polynyas are formed. The New Siberian polynya\n(NS), the western New Siberian polynya (WNS), the Anabar\u2010Lena polynya (AL), the Taymyr polynya\n(T), the northeastern Taymyr polynya (NET), and the eastern Severnaya Zemlya (ESZ) polynya. Color\ncoding corresponds to the bathymetry (water depth in m, source is Smith and Sandwell [1997]).\nKRUMPEN ET AL.: POLYNYA DENSE WATER FORMATION C05014C05014\n2 of 17\nplume of the River Lena eastward toward the East Siberian\nSea, thus causing higher salinities in the eastern Laptev Sea\nand the area around the WNS polynya. This results in weaker\ndensity stratification, as observed in 2007 by H\u00f6lemann et al.\n[2011] and Dmitrenko et al. [2010a].\n[7] According to Dmitrenko et al. [2005], the probability\nfor the water column to get fully mixed down to the seafloor\nin the region of the Western New Siberian polynya is around\n20%. Their findings are based on hydrological data obtained\nbetween1979 and 1999 rather than sea\u2010ice observations.\nHowever, owing to the strong stratification and the notice-\nable lack of extreme polynya events in the Laptev Sea\n[Winsor and Bjoerk, 2000], we argue that ice production\nalone in the WNS polynya is not high enough to erode the\nhalocline and that the probability for dense water formation\nis far lower than the 20% calculated by Dmitrenko et al.\n[2005]. In this paper, we therefore investigate the effect of\nintense ice formation taking place during an exceptionally\nstrong and consistent polynya event on a water column\nstructure with a relatively weak vertical density gradient,\npreconditioned by a cyclonic atmospheric circulation during\nsummer [Dmitrenko et al., 2010a].\n[8] Below we use an idealized polynya flux model [Pease,\n1987] to simulate an extremely strong opening event of the\nWNS polynya. The event was chosen based on a time series\nof Envisat synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images covering a\nperiod of 7 winters (2003\u20132009). Starting on 10 February\n2004, constant offshore winds opened up the polynya for a\nperiod of 27 days. The flux model computes the evolution of\nthe open water area and resultant thin ice zone, and the\nassociated ice and salt fluxes. In winter 2004, the water body\nwas preconditioned toward a weak stratification state by a\ncyclonic atmospheric circulation regime during summer\n2003. For the calculation presented in this study we use an\naverage water mass structure that is representative of the\ndensity stratification in the area of the WNS polynya during\nyears with a cyclonic atmospheric circulation. The under-\nlying hydrographic data are taken from the data archive of\nthe Russian Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute and\nformer Russian\u2010German expeditions. Whether ice formation\nduring the 2004 polynya event is strong enough to erode\nhalocline is judged by integrating the amount of salt rejec-\ntion over the weakly stratified water column.\n[9] Because ice production and salt rejection in a polynya\nare highest inside the open water zone, an accurate deter-\nmination of ice and salt fluxes require a correct simulation of\nthe open water edge evolution [Morales Maqueda et al.,\n2004]. Unfortunately, a satellite\u2010based verification of com-\nputed open water extents is difficult, since open water edges\nare not easily identifiable in satellite images [Barber et al.,\n2001; Haarpaintner et al., 2001]. Prior to the simulation\nof the major polynya opening event observed in 2004, we\ntherefore test the model parameterizations and performance\nby applying it to a minor but well documented opening\nevent in April 2008. The event lasted for approximately\n6 days and was observed during the TRANSDRIFT XIII\n(TD XIII) expedition carried out within the framework of the\nRussian\u2010German research cooperation programme \u201cLaptev\nSea System\u201d. Information on the temporal and spatial evo-\nlution of the open water area and pack ice edges, as well as\nthe thickness of thin ice, are obtained from photogrammetric\nand electromagnetic airborne surveys, thermal infrared sat-\nellite imagery and high\u2010resolution RADAR satellites.\n[10] The structure of the paper is as follows. First, the\nmodel description is given in section 2. We then describe\nthe data set used for model calibration and verification\n(section 3). In section 4, we apply the model to the well\ndocumented event of April 2008 and to the exceptionally\nstrong opening event of February 2004. In addition, the\nmodel parameterizations and performance are tested and dis-\ncussed by comparing simulated open water width and thin\nice thickness with observations and satellite\u2010based estimates\nand by means of a sensitivity study. Subsequently, we inves-\ntigate the effect of ice production during the 2004 event on a\nweakly stratified water body, preconditioned by a cyclonic\ncirculation regime in summer (section 5). Conclusions are\ndrawn in section 6.\n2. Polynya Flux Model Description\n[11] The objective of our model is to calculate the amount\nof ice production and salt rejection in a flaw polynya on the\nbasis of wind and air temperature information. Below, we\nbriefly describe the concepts behind the model. Following\nHaarpaintner et al. [2001], two simple one\u2010dimensional\nFigure 2. Schematic illustrating of the polynya model. In the open water area, heat loss to the atmo-\nsphere (Qnet) results in frazil ice growth with rate Dhf \/Dt. Frazil ice piles up against the open water edge\nwith thickness H and then drifts away from the edge with speed u. The pack ice edge moves with velocity\nU. The instantaneous salt flux from frazil ice growth in the open water zone is given by SR. Salt rejection\ninduced by the continuous growth of consolidated new ice is denoted by SI.\nKRUMPEN ET AL.: POLYNYA DENSE WATER FORMATION C05014C05014\n3 of 17\ndrift algorithms are used to simulate the evolutions of the\nopen water region and the pack ice edge (Figure 2).\n[12] The first algorithm computes the width of the wind\u2010\ngenerated open water zone R [Pease, 1987]. Because of its\nsimple idealized formulation and its ability to provide fairly\naccurate ice production estimates [Krumpen et al., 2011a], a\nflux model is used. Polynya flux models were first formu-\nlated by Pease [1987], embracing an idea of Lebedev [1968]\nthat wind\u2010generated coastal polynyas attain a maximum size\ndetermined by a balance between ice production within and\nflux of ice out of the open water zone [Morales Maqueda\net al., 2004; Willmott et al., 2007; Krumpen et al., 2011a].\nFollowing Pease [1987], the width of the open water zone,\nR, can be expressed as\nRt \u00bc Rt\u0002Dt 1\u0002Dhf =H\n\u0001 \u0003\u00fe uDt; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere Rt is the open water width at time t and Dt is the\ntemporal resolution of the atmospheric data set. Dhf is the\namount of frazil ice produced in the water column between\ntime t and t \u2212 Dt, calculated from the surface heat balance\nQnet [Cavalieri and Martin, 1994]\nQs \u00fe Ql \u00fe Qlw \u00fe 1\u0002 \u0002\u00f0 \u00deQsw \u00bc \u0002Qnet= \u0003f Ls\n\u0001 \u0003 \u00bc hf ; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere Qs and Ql are the turbulent sensible and latent heat\nfluxes, respectively. Qlw is the net longwave radiation at\nthe sea surface, Qsw is the shortwave solar radiation, and a is\nthe surface albedo [Cavalieri and Martin, 1994; Morales\nMaqueda et al., 2004]. In (2), rf is the frazil ice density\nset to 950 kg m\u22123 [Martin and Kauffman, 1981] and Ls is the\nlatent heat of formation of ice (Ls \u2248 235 k J kg\u22121), calculated\nfollowing Haarpaintner et al. [2001]. If Qnet is negative, the\nwater body transfers heat to the atmosphere and frazil ice\nis produced. The atmospheric forcing is assumed to be\nuniform over both the open water and thin ice regions.\nFinally, u in (1) is the speed of consolidated new ice at the\nopen water edge (Figure 2).\n[13] After formation, frazil ice instantaneously piles up\nagainst the open water edge and consolidates into a thin ice\nlayer with thickness H. In this study, we determine H, fol-\nlowing Biggs et al. [2000], as a function of the depth of\nfrazil ice arriving at the open water edge and an increase in\nthickness caused by the piling up of frazil ice against ice\nfloes.\n[14] According to Skogseth et al. [2004], the drift of\nconsolidated new ice away from the open water edge, u, can\nbe described by\nu \u00bc \u0004cUa cos \u2019m \u0002 \u2019o\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere \u0004c is a nondimensional proportionality constant, Ua is\nthe wind speed and \u2019m is the wind direction. Following\nPease [1987], the constant of proportionality is set to 0.03.\n\u2019o is is the wind direction with strongest effect on the\nopening of the polynya [Haarpaintner et al., 2001]. The\nopening of the WNS polynya is most effective when the ice\ndrift is normal to the fast ice boundary. The fast ice between\nthe Lena Delta and the New Siberian Islands is aligned with\nabout 50\u00b0, and according to Envisat satellite scenes, the ice\ndrift differs about 10\u00b0 to the right of the wind direction.\nConsequently, \u2019o in (3) is set to 130\u00b0.\n[15] The continuous thermodynamic growth of the con-\nsolidated new ice is calculated by Stefan\u2019s law [Petrich and\nEicken, 2010]. In this study we apply the numeric equation\nof Maykut [1985] that considers an insulating snow layer on\ntop of the ice, with the volumetric latent heat of freezing (L)\nset to 295.8 kJ kg\u22121 (note the difference from Ls used in (2))\nand an ice density set to 920 kg m\u22123. In spite of its sim-\nplicity, the so\u2010called degree day model is capable of pro-\nducing fairly accurate predictions of sea ice growth.\n[16] The evolution of the pack ice edge P is reconstructed\nby a second drift equation\nPt \u00bc Pt\u0002Dt \u00fe UDt; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere Pt is the pack ice extent at time t and U is the velocity\nof the pack ice drift. U is calculated similar to equation (3),\nbut with \u0004c set to 0.01. The variability in ice drift between\n1% of the wind velocity in very dense pack ice and 3%\ninside the polynya area is based on a comparison between\nthe displacement of individual ice floes in SAR scenes and\nthe wind velocity.\n[17] The width of the thin ice zone I is calculated as the\ndifference between P and R. The area of the polynya is\ncomputed by multiplying its width times the alongshore\nlength of the WNS polynya (195 km).\n[18] The accuracy of ice production estimates obtained\nfrom a polynya flux model was investigated by Krumpen\net al. [2011a], who compared model results to ice thickness\nand ice production estimates derived from thermal infrared\nsatellite data. It was found that regional discrepancies between\nmodel and satellite observations are at least partly due to the\nmissing representation of the dynamics of thin ice thicken-\ning. To overcome this deficiency, we parameterize the effect\nof dynamic thickening of thin ice in the model by assuming\nthat the differential drift of the pack ice and consolidated\nnew ice, U \u2212 u, results in ice rafting and, therefore, com-\npression of the thin ice zone, I. The dynamic ice thickening\ncaused by this compression is governed by the equation of\nconservation of mass. Based on literature and field observa-\ntions we assume rafting to be limited to ice thinner than 0.3 m\n[Melling et al., 1993; Worby et al., 1996; Babko et al., 2002].\nThere is a lack of studies on rafting probabilities in thin ice,\nand so it is not known how the compression is distributed\nthrough ice thinner than 0.3 m. However, for simplicity, we\nassume the effects of compression on a thin ice zone to\ndecrease linearly with ice thickness.\n[19] As ice grows, salt is rejected and added to the water\nbody. The amount of salt rejected is dependent on the initial\nsurface salinity. The instantaneous salt flux from frazil ice\ngrowth in the open water zone, SR, is calculated following\nWinsor and Bjoerk [2000] by assuming a spontaneous\nrejection of 69%. Once frazil ice consolidates to a thin solid\nlayer, the formulation of Ryvlin [1974] is used to estimate\nsalt rejection induced by the continuous growth of consol-\nidated ice, SI. For the 2008 event, a growth rate coefficient\nof 0.5 is applied, owing to comparatively high air tem-\nperatures. In contrast, the simulation of the comparatively\ncold 2004 event requires a lower value of 0.35. Note that the\nRyvlin [1974] formula gives rather large salt entrapment for\nKRUMPEN ET AL.: POLYNYA DENSE WATER FORMATION C05014C05014\n4 of 17\nice with thicknesses less than 10 cm compared to other\nempirical formula and observations. This might lead to a\nslight underestimation of salt rejection in the transition zone.\n3. Data\n3.1. Satellite Observations\n[20] The evolution of the 2004 and 2008 polynya events\nwere continuously monitored with different satellites.\n[21] Envisat advanced SAR images provide information\nabout ice dynamics in the eastern Laptev Sea. Each polynya\nevent is covered by 4 scenes. Two of the scenes for 2008\nand another two for 2004 are shown in Figures 3 and 4,\nrespectively. The Envisat C band wide swath data is VV\npolarized and covers an area of approximately 400 \u00d7 800 km2\nwith a spatial resolution of 150 \u00d7 150 m2. Fast ice and pack\nice edges, and hence the polynya width, are easily identifi-\nable in SAR images. The determination of open water width\nis not straight forward, since the backscatter signatures\ninside the open water region and the consolidation zone can\nbe very inhomogeneous and vary with meteorological con-\nditions. In addition, often no clear boundary does exists\nbetween open water and consolidated thin ice. To validate\nopen water width simulated by the model in 2008, the\ninterpretation of Envisat SAR imagery is aided by helicopter\u2010\nbased observations, high\u2010resolution TerraSAR\u2010X scenes,\nmeteorological data, and surface temperature information\nfrom the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer\n(AVHRR). The validation of the 2004 event simulation is\nexclusively based on Envisat SAR scenes, thermal AVHRR\nimages and atmospheric information.\n[22] The TerraSAR\u2010X scenes (Strip Map Mode, X Band)\nare dual polarized (HH\u2010VV) with a spatial resolution of\n6.6 \u00d7 1.2 m2 and cover a 15 km wide and 150 km long swath\nacross the polynya. The 5 images were used to monitor thin\nice dynamics and the evolution andwidth of the consolidation\nand open water zone during TD XIII. An example is given in\nFigure 5. A TerraSAR\u2010X image obtained on 28 April 2008\nat 0837 UTC is shown together with drift corrected aerial\nphotographs, taken 3 h and 40 min before satellite acquisi-\ntion. The three enlarged aerial photographs, with the black\nlines pointing to the corresponding footprint, show the open\nwater zone (Figure 5a), the open water edge (Figure 5b), and\nrafted thin ice (Figure 5c).\n[23] To validate the model simulated ice thickness, ther-\nmal infrared data is used to derive estimates of thermal ice\nthickness, hTH, calculated with the aid of an atmospheric\ndata set (section 3.4) using the surface energy balance model\nsuggested by Yu and Lindsay [2003]. Ice surface tempera-\ntures (Ts) are derived from thermal infrared channels fol-\nlowing the split window method of Key et al. [1997]. Level\n1B calibrated radiances (visible and thermal infrared) were\nobtained from the U.S. National Oceanic and Administra-\ntion (NOAA) Comprehensive Large Array data Stewardship\nSystem (CLASS). The spatial resolution of AVHRR Local\nArea Coverage (LAC) data is 1.1 \u00d7 1.1 km2. The method\nrequires clear sky conditions. In total, we identified 1 scene,\ncovering the event in 2008, and 2 scenes imaging the opening\nin 2004. The thickness retrieval is based on the assumption\nthat the heat flux through the ice equals the atmospheric\nheat flux. Following Yu and Lindsay [2003],hth is inferred\nfrom the obtained Ts by\nhth \u00bc ki Ts \u0002 To\u00f0 \u00de=Qnet; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere To = \u22121.86\u00b0C is the seawater temperature at freezing\npoint and ki = 2.03 W m\n\u22121 K\u22121 is the thermal conductivity of\nsea ice [Drucker et al., 2003]. Qnet is calculated from\nequation (2), with same parameterizations as used for the\nmodel. The method yields good results for ice thicknesses\nbelow 0.5 m, further assuming that vertical temperature\nprofiles within the ice are linear and no snow is present on\ntop of the ice [Drucker et al., 2003]. Figure 6 shows the\nthermal ice thickness distribution inside the polynya area as\nderived from an AVHRR image taken on 18 February 2004.\n3.2. Airborne Data\n[24] During TD XIII, two helicopter\u2010borne surveys of\nelectromagnetic (HEM) ice thickness, hHEM, were per-\nformed across and along the WNS polynya. The profile\nobtained on 29 April 2008 is shown in Figure 3. It is used to\nvalidate polynya flux computations. The so\u2010called EM\u2010Bird,\nis an airborne electromagnetic (EM) system with a single\nfrequency of 4.08 kHz [Haas et al., 2009]. The instrument\nFigure 4. Envisat SAR images acquired on 18 and 27 Feb-\nruary 2004. The scenes cover the position of the WNS\npolynya, showing the fast ice belt, the active polynya zone,\nand a region of freely floating pack ice.\nFigure 3. Envisat synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images\nacquired on (left) 28 April and (right) 1 May 2008, covering\nthe WNS polynya. The sea ice regime consists of the fast ice\nzone (south of the black solid line), an active polynya zone\n(open water and thin ice), and a region of freely floating pack\nice (north of the black dashed line). The red line in Figure 3\n(left) highlights the profile of the helicopter\u2010borne surveys\nof electromagnetic (HEM)\u2010Bird ice thickness measurements\non 29 April at 0400 UTC.\nKRUMPEN ET AL.: POLYNYA DENSE WATER FORMATION C05014C05014\n5 of 17\nwas towed by a helicopter 15 meters above the ice surface.\nThe method utilizes the contrast of electrical conductivity\nbetween seawater and sea ice to determine the distance to\nthe ice\u2010water interface. An additional laser altimeter yields\nthe distance to the uppermost reflecting surface, hence hHEM\nis obtained as the ice plus snow thickness from the differ-\nence between the laser range and the EM\u2010derived distance.\nSince the laser beam is always reflected at the uppermost\nsurface, snow thickness, if present, is included in hHEM.\nHowever, the polynya event in 2008 is characterized by the\nabsence of a snow cover on the thin ice, and therefore hHEM\npresents the real ice thickness. The measurements were\ntaken with point spacing of 3 to 4 m depending on the speed\nof the helicopter. Within the footprint of a single measure-\nment (40\u201350 m) the accuracy over level sea ice is on the\norder of \u00b110 cm [Pfaffling et al., 2007; Haas et al., 2009].\n[25] On all HEM flights, geocoded aerial photographs were\ntaken with a downward\u2010looking digital camera [Krumpen\net al., 2011b]. Images were used to provide general infor-\nmation about ice dynamics, to support the calibration of\nHEM ice thickness measurements and to aid TerraSAR\u2010X\nand Envisat image interpretation (Figure 5).\n3.3. Historical Hydrographic Information\n[26] The mean stratification of the water column in winter\n2004 was constructed by using salinity records obtained\nduring the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (ARRI)\nSever expeditions (1979\u20131990, 1992, and 1993), together\nwith CTD measurements made during several Russian\u2010\nGerman winter expeditions. The mean stratification pattern\nand its standard deviation (STDV) is calculated by averag-\ning salinity measurements made in the center of the WNS\npolynya area during winter surveys, preconditioned by\nsummers with a cyclonic atmospheric circulation regime. In\ntotal, 10 stations completed between February and May in\nthe region of the WNS polynya are used to calculate the\nmean stratification pattern. Most of the surveys were carried\nout in the 70s and 80s, when the atmospheric circulation in\nsummer was predominantly cyclonic [Dmitrenko et al.,\n2009]. For a detailed description of the hydrographic data\nset we refer to the publication of Dmitrenko et al. [2009].\n3.4. Atmospheric Data Set\n[27] The model is driven with atmospheric data extracted\nfrom a single grid point in the center of the polynya.\nPolynya evolution, ice production and salt rejection are\ncalculated using sea level pressure, 2 m air temperature and\nhumidity, precipitation, surface net radiation and 10 m wind\nvectors.\n[28] The simulation of the opening event of 2008 is driven\nwith 1 hourly data from Consortium for Small\u2010Scale Mod-\neling (COSMO) simulations which were specifically per-\nformed for the Laptev Sea area by Schroeder et al. [2011].\nBy prescribing the polynya areas daily these data account\nfor the impact of polynyas on the atmospheric boundary\nlayer. The quality of the COSMO data is shown by a\ncomparison with automatic weather stations and surface\ntemperature derived from MODIS satellite data [Schroeder\net al., 2011].\n[29] Ice and salt fluxes during the polynya event of 2004\nare computed with 6 h National Centers for Environmental\nFigure 6. Thermal ice thickness (hTH) as derived from\nAdvanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sur-\nface temperatures taken on 18 February 2004 at 1200 UTC\nand National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)\/\nDepartment of Energy reanalysis data.\nFigure 5.

Model Simulations\n4.1. Satellite Observations and Atmospheric\nConditions During the 2008 Event\n[30] According to airborne observations, AVHRR scenes\nand TerraSAR\u2010X and Envisat SAR imagery, the 2008\npolynya event started on 27 April and lasted for a period of\n6 days. Consistent offshore winds and temperatures between\n\u221217\u00b0C and \u22124\u00b0C led to the formation of a 4\u201316 km wide\nopen water zone and an extensive region of new thin ice. On\n2 May air temperatures raised above the freezing point of\nseawater, causing the polynya to gain heat and ice produc-\ntion to halt.\n[31] The COSMO\u2010based 1 hourly air temperatures and\n6 hourly wind velocities for the time of interest are pre-\nsented in Figure 7 (top). Figure 3 shows the WNS polynya\nas observed by two SAR scenes acquired on 28 April and\n1 May 2008. Open water zones are made visible by the\nbrighter parallel wind\u2010generated Langmuir streaks oriented\nperpendicular to the fast ice edge [Drucker et al., 2003]. The\nbright and dark radar backscatter features within the polynya\nregion are associated with pancake and frazil ice formation\n[Kwok et al., 2007]. Several bands of consolidated new thin\nice orientated nearly parallel to the fast ice edge are apparent\ndownwind of the open water area.\n4.2. Simulation of the 2008 Event\n[32] The polynya flux model was used to simulate the first\n5.25 days of the 2008 polynya opening event. The model\u2019s\natmospheric forcing was extracted from the COSMO\natmospheric data set. The salinity of the surface layer at the\nonset of the polynya opening was set to 26, following\nhydrographic observations made along the fast ice edge\nduring TD XIII [Dmitrenko et al., 2010b].\n[33] Figure 7 (bottom) presents the simulated and\nobserved (Envisat, TerraSAR\u2010X and aerial photographs)\nevolution of the widths of the open water and thin ice areas,\nand the modeled thin ice thickness over the 5.25 days of\nsimulation. At the onset of the polynya event, constant\neasterly winds push the pack ice edge offshore, resulting in\nthe development of a wide open water zone. A thin ice zone\nin the model develops, and is then continuously thickening\nby thermodynamic and dynamic processes. On 29 April, the\nmodeled thin ice zone extends up to 40 km offshore and the\nopen water area reaches a width of approximately 8 km.\nLater, a slight change in wind direction and a temporary\ndecrease in wind velocity cause a slow down of ice offshore\ntransport, reducing the width of the open water zone to 4 km.\n[34] The simulated evolution of the WNS polynya agrees\nwell with observations. The mean deviation between mod-\nFigure 7. Atmospheric data (Consortium for Small\u2010Scale Modeling) and polynya model results during\nthe study period in April 2008.

The deviation between modeled open water width\nand satellite and airborne observations is 1.4 km.\n[35] The accuracy of the simulated thin ice thickness is\ntested by comparing model results to ice thickness estimates\nobtained from the HEM flight on 29 April at 0400 UTC and\nfrom a thermal infrared AVHRR scene acquired 14 h later\n(Figure 8). For comparison, HEM measurements were\naveraged over a 250 m interval. Gaps in hHEM data at dis-\ntances of 9\u201314 km and 23\u201326 km offshore the fast ice edge\nare the result of HEM instrument calibration [Pfaffling et al.,\n2007]. The comparison shows that simulated ice thickness is\nnear the range of hHEM measurements, although the model\noverestimate the observations. Highest ice thicknesses can\nbe found close to the pack ice edge in both HEM observa-\ntions and model simulations.\n[36] The agreement between AVHRR infrared ice\nthickness and model results is higher than between HEM\nmeasurements and model. Note that the AVHRR ice\nthickness profile shown in Figure 8 is averaged along the\npolynya. Both AVHRR and model data show an increase\nin ice thickness with distance from the fast ice edge. The\nsimulated ice thickness tends to be generally lower than\nthermal ice thickness observations. As opposed to the model,\nthe AVHRR sensor does not resolve the open water zone.\nInstead, the zone close to the fast ice edge is characterized\nby very low thicknesses varying between 0.01 and 0.05 m.\n[37] In total, an ice volume of 1.4 km3 is formed between\n27 April and 1 May 2008. Of this ice, 40% (\u22480.6 km3) is\nproduced in the open water zone, which represents on\naverage 19% of the entire polynya area. The total amount of\nsalt rejected is about 0.17 \u00d7 1011 kg, of which 0.1 \u00d7 1011 kg\nare rejected as frazil ice forms in open water zone. Putting\nour frazil ice\u2013induced salt rejection estimates in relation to\nthe mean seasonal salt rejection calculations made by\nWinsor and Bjoerk [2000] (0.77 \u00d7 1011 kg) the early spring\npolynya event accounts for approximately 13% of the mean\nseasonal salt flux. Distributing the amount of salt rejected in\nthe open water zone with a mean width of 6.6 km over a no\nstratified water body with a depth of 25 m would result in a\nsalinity increase of approximately 0.3.\n4.3. Discussion of Flux Model Parameterizations and\nPerformance\n[38] Because ice production and salt rejection are highest\nin the open water area, accurate determination of the open\nwater edge in the model is of paramount importance. The\ncomparison of simulated open water width with observa-\ntions made by helicopter, high\u2010resolution TerraSAR\u2010X\nscenes and Envisat SAR images has shown that the flux\nmodel is capable of simulating correctly the extend of the\nopen water zone (Figure 7). This is in agreement with\nfindings made by Haarpaintner et al. [2001], Skogseth et al.\n[2004], and Krumpen et al. [2011a]. Deviations between\nsimulated and observed open water widths are related to the\nparameterizations and representation of physical processes\nin the model, and are discussed below.\n[39] The assumption of spatial uniformity is justified by\nthe fact that longshore variations in wind direction and air\ntemperature, and their associated errors in computed ice and\nsalt fluxes, are comparatively small for both polynya events.\nNevertheless, if dealing with larger longshore polynya\ndimensions, the use of a two\u2010dimensional flux approach\ndriven by a spatially variable atmospheric forcing is required\n[Krumpen et al., 2011a]. Note that in contrast to the NCEP\/\nDOE reanalysis data used for the simulation of the 2004\nevent, the COSMO data set incorporates the impact of the\npolynya on the atmospheric boundary layer. T. Ernsdorf et\nal. (Impact of atmospheric forcing data on simulations of the\nLaptev Sea polynya dynamics using the sea\u2010ice ocean model\nfesom, submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research,\n2010) investigate the differences in ice production that result\nfrom the use of different atmospheric forcing data. Fol-\nlowing Ernsdorf et al. (submitted manuscript, 2010), NCEP\/\nDOE data overestimate temperatures by as much as 1.7 K,\nwhile COSMO is in good agreement with observations.\n[40] A shortcoming of the polynya flux model is that frazil\nice is assumed to instantaneously pile up against the thin ice\nedge. The incorporation of a finite frazil ice drift rate [Ou,\n1988; Biggs et al., 2000] and the effect of currents on the\nmodeled frazil ice drift trajectories [Willmott et al., 1997]\nbecomes important as the open water region grows in size.\nHowever, the development of large open water zones in the\neastern Laptev Sea polynyas is generally a rare event owing\nto prevailing low temperatures and moderate wind speeds\nduring winter [Winsor and Bjoerk, 2000].\n[41] We find the simulated open water region width and\nthin ice thickness to be extremely sensitive to the param-\neterization of the collection depth H. Different parame-\nterizations used in one\u2010dimensional and two\u2010dimensional\npolynya flux models are discussed by Martin and Kauffman\n[1981], Pease [1987], Alam and Curry [1998], Winsor and\nBjoerk [2000], Morales Maqueda and Willmott [2000], and\nKrumpen et al. [2011a]. Figure 9 shows how the simulated\nopen water width differs if using different parameterizations\nof the collection depth. The use of a constant thickness\nparameterization (0.1 m or 0.2 m) as suggested by, e.g.,\nPease [1987] or Haarpaintner et al. [2001] leads to a crude\noverestimation of the width of the open water region. Most\nrealistic results are achieved with the parameterizations\ndeveloped byMartin and Kauffman [1981], [Alam and Curry\n[1998], and Biggs et al. [2000]. The work of Martin and\nFigure 8. (top) Comparison of the HEM\u2010Bird ice thickness\nprofile (solid red line) taken on 29 April 2008 at 0400 UTC\nacross the thin ice zone with the modeled ice thickness pro-\nfile (dashed blue line). (bottom) Comparison of an AVHRR\u2010\nderived ice thickness profile (hTH, solid red line, 29 April\n2008 at 2000 UTC) of the thin ice zone with the simulated\nice thickness profile (dashed blue line).\nKRUMPEN ET AL.: POLYNYA DENSE WATER FORMATION C05014C05014\n8 of 17\nKauffman [1981] is based on laboratory observations show-\ning that frazil ice accumulates with a thickness of 5\u20138 cm.\nFollowing Martin and Kauffman [1981], the frazil ice has\nan ice volume fraction of about 40%, such that H becomes\n2\u20133 cm. Alam and Curry [1998] proposed an empirical\nparameterization that includes both wave and pressure\neffects. In this parameterization, the pile up thickness depends\non both wind speed [Winsor and Bjoerk, 2000] and polynya\nwidth. The dependence on polynya width (or fetch) is an\nindirect way of taking into account wave radiation. When\nthe polynya is too narrow, the wavefield is very weak and\nwave radiation cannot greatly influence pile up. As the\npolynya widens, the wavefield fully develops and wave\nradiation increasingly contributes to pile up. In our study,\nthe best results were achieved by using the parameterization\nof Biggs et al. [2000], who determine the consolidation\nthickness as the sum of the thickness of frazil ice arriving at\nthe edge and a pile up depth. In an earlier study we could\nshow that, in addition to a more correct representation of the\nopen water extent, the use of this parameterization results in\nmost realistic thin ice thicknesses [Krumpen et al., 2011a].\n[42] The HEM\u2010 and AVHRR\u2010derived thin ice thickness\nprofiles and the model simulation show a thickness anomaly\n5 km near the pack ice edge (Figure 8). This strong increase\nis too steep to result solely from thermodynamic growth, but\nis a consequence of enhanced dynamic thickening at the\npack ice edge: In the model, the compression of the thin ice\nzone results from the difference in pack ice drift U and\nconsolidated new ice velocity u. At the onset of the event,\ncompression acts on a relatively narrow thin ice zone, resulting\nin a strong dynamic ice thickening and the development of\nthe thickness anomaly in Figure 8. When the polynya\nwidens and thin ice zone is growing in width, compression is\ndistributed over a larger area and ice deformation weakens.\nThe good agreement between observations and simulations\nindicates that the representation of dynamic ice growth in the\nmodel is a reasonable approximation. However, the drift\nequation for u is highly simplified and contains empirically\ntuned and uncertain parameters (equation (3)). Owing to the\nplasticity of the thin ice cover, ice drift rates are likely to\nvary in space and time. The associated ice production error\nis investigated in section 4.7.\n[43] Note that the HEM profiles used to verify model\nresults are challenging for two reasons. First, the processing\nof the EM\u2010Bird data is based on the assumption that sea ice\ncan be regarded as a nonconductive medium. Over thin ice,\nhowever, this assumption may be invalid because the con-\nductivity of saline young ice can be significantly higher than\nthat of older first\u2010year or multiyear ice. This may lead to\nunderestimates of the ice thickness. Therefore, all hHEM data\nhave to be interpreted as minimum ice thicknesses. Sec-\nondly, the conductivity of the surface waters can be low and\nhighly variable due to their proximity to the freshwater input\nby the Lena River. Although a relatively low water con-\nductivity of between 2200 and 2400 S m\u22121 was used for the\nretrieval of ice thicknesses, our processing algorithms do not\ntake into account conductivity variations during individual\nflights.\n[44] The accuracy of thermal infrared AVHRR thickness\nestimates is difficult to assess but believed to bewithin a range\nof \u00b120% [Drucker et al., 2003]. Because time of interest is\ncharacterized by the absence of snow coverage, the largest\nsource of error in hTH probably arises from uncertainties in\nthe atmospheric data set. Unfortunately, AVHRR thermal\nthickness estimates do not resolve open water zones present\non SAR imagery and aerial photography. This is because in\nthermal infrared observations open water areas are charac-\nterized by a surface temperature close to the freezing point\nof seawater. Hence, the presence of frazil ice, Langmuir\nstreaks or ice floes in the water column lowers the averaged\nsurface temperature within the sensor footprint beneath\nfreezing point, such that potential open water areas are\nclassified as very thin ice.\n4.4. Satellite Observations and Atmospheric\nConditions During the 2004 Event\n[45] According to the Envisat SAR scenes, the polynya\nevent in 2004 started on 10 February, and remained open for\n27 days. Strong and consistent offshore winds, together with\nextremely low air temperatures of between \u221244\u00b0C and\u221222\u00b0C,\nresulted in strong ice formation and the development of a\nbroad open water area. Figure 10 (top) presents 6 hourly air\ntemperatures and wind velocities taken from NCEP\/DOE\nreanalysis data extracted from a single point nominally in\nFigure 9. Open water width evolution during the 2008 poylyna event as calculated using different para-\nmeterizations for H.

Figure 4 shows two SAR images\ntaken on 18 and 27 February 2004. The polynya opened in a\nnorthwest direction. The thin ice zone grew up to an extent\nof approximately 140 km. A sudden change in wind direc-\ntion on 5 March, caused a temporary closure of the polynya.\nAs in Figure 3, the presence of Langmuir streaks indicates\nice production in extensive open water zones. The banded\nstructures orientated parallel to the polynya edge are located\nin the thin ice region.\n4.5. Simulation of the 2004 Event\n[46] We applied the polynya flux model to the simulation\nof the exceptionally strong polynya event in 2004. The\nevolution of the open water and thin ice zones, and the\nassociated ice production and salt rejection, were calculated\nwith atmospheric forcing extracted from NCEP\/DOE\nreanalysis data.\n[47] Figure 10 (bottom) presents the simulated and\nobserved evolution of the extents of the open water and thin\nice regions, as well as the modeled thin ice thickness over\nthe 27 day duration of the polynya event. The simulated drift\nof the outer pack ice edge slightly overestimates the\nremotely sensed drift. A validation of the computed open\nwater width is difficult with Envisat SAR images alone.\n[48] Low air temperatures and high wind velocities\n(Figure 10, top), result in an enhanced thermodynamic and\ndynamic growth of the thin ice zone compared to the 2008\nevent. To evaluate the accuracy of the simulated thin ice\nthickness, we again compare AVHRR infrared ice thickness\nobservations with the model results (Figure 11). The\nagreement between thermal ice thickness profiles taken on\n18 and 27 February and simulations is high for areas 10 km\noffshore the fast ice edge. Further onshore, AVHRR esti-\nmates differ significantly from the ice thicknesses simulated\nby the flux model. The mean thin ice thickness on 18 Feb-\nruary is 0.34 m for AVHRR and 0.38 m for model ice\nthickness. The respective thin ice thicknesses on 27 February\nare 0.32 m and 0.37 m.\n[49] We estimate that, between 10 February and 5 March\n2004, an ice volume of 26 km3 was produced. Approxi-\nmately 8.1 km3 (32% of the total ice production) originates\nfrom frazil ice growth in the open water zone. This is\nFigure 11.

A comparison\nof our calculations with annual polynya ice production esti-\nmates made by Dethleff et al. [1998], Winsor and Bjoerk\n[2000], and Dmitrenko et al. [2005] can be used as an\nindicator to check whether the 2004 event is a comparatively\nstrong or a rather week event. According to Winsor and\nBjoerk [2000], the annual ice formation in the area around\nthe WNS polynya amounts to 14.2 m. If compared to esti-\nmates of Winsor and Bjoerk [2000], the 2004 event would\ncontribute with as much as 57% to the mean annual ice\nproduction. Dethleff et al. [1998] calculated the flaw\npolynya to produce about 7.4 m of ice in winter 1991\/1992,\nwhile the average annual polynya ice production calculated\nby Dmitrenko et al. [2005] is lower (3\u20134 m). If compared\nwith these annual estimates, the 2004 event is an excep-\ntionally strong one.\n4.6. Discussion of the 2004 Event Simulation\n[50] The simulated evolution of the pack ice edge is in\ngood agreement with satellite observations. Unfortunately, a\nvalidation of the simulated open water width is difficult, as\nthe edge of the open water region is not easily identifiable in\nSAR scenes. We have confidence, however, in our simula-\ntion of the open water evolution, as it was proven to be\nacceptably accurate for the well documented 2008 event. An\nadditional indication of the degree of accuracy of the model\ncan be derived from a comparison of the average length of\nLangmuir streaks in SAR images with the simulated open\nwater width. A comparison shows that the model simulated\nopen water width is in the range of Langmuir\u2010based esti-\nmates. However, the accuracy of the SAR\u2010based open water\nextraction very much depends on the image geometry (e.g.,\nincident angle and spatial resolution) and atmospheric con-\nditions (e.g., wind velocity). Hence, comparing Langmuir\nstreak lengths with model results is a rather qualitative\napproximation for the model accuracy and therefore not\nshown here.\n[51] The good agreement between simulated thin ice\nthickness and AVHRR\u2010based estimates in areas 10 km\noffshore the fast ice indicates that the algorithms to calculate\nthe ice drift rates U and u are well tuned. It also suggests that\nthe parameterization for H calculated following Biggs et al.\n[2000], the applied approach to simulate thermodynamic ice\ngrowth and the dynamic thickening of thin ice are appro-\npriate. The large discrepancies in ice thickness estimates\nnear the fast ice edge eventually arise from the low spatial\nresolution of the AVHRR sensor compared to the polynya\nwidth. AVHRR\u2010based water width estimates suffer from\nmixed pixel signatures, the presence of frazil ice, Langmuir\nstreaks or ice floes in the water column that lower the\naveraged surface temperature within the sensor footprint\nbeneath freezing point, such that potential open water areas\nare classified as very thin ice [Willmes et al., 2010; Krumpen\net al., 2011a]. An additional uncertainty in the hTH esti-\nmates arises from the potential presence of snow on the\nthin ice. The magnitude of this source of error is unknown.\nHowever, sensitivity tests made by Yu and Rothrock [1996]\nsuggests that an uncertainty of 1 cm in snow depth results in\na hTH error greater than 100% for ice less than 5 cm thick\nand more than 50% for ice around 10 cm thick; this error\ndecreases to about 33% for ice 20 cm thick and to 7% for ice\n100 cm thick.\n4.7. Sensitivity Study\n[52] The evolution of the open water area and the amount\nof frazil ice being formed is most relevant for the ability of\nthe polynya to erode the density stratification of the water\nbody. Below we test how uncertainties associated to the\nparameterizations used in the 2004 computation would\naffect the ice growth rate inside the open water area, as well\nas the total amount of ice formed in the thin ice and open\nwater zone. The results of this sensitivity study are sum-\nmarized in Table 1.\n[53] The presence of open water inside a closed ice pack\ngradually warms the air above. Because air temperatures for\nthe 2004 event were taken from 6 h NCEP\/DOE reanalysis\ndata, where the impact of polynyas and leads is not con-\nsidered, ice production rates are likely to be overestimated\n(Ernsdorf et al., submitted manuscript, 2010). Assuming the\naverage air temperature in the area of the polynya to be 3\u00b0C\nlower\/higher, causes the accumulated ice production inside\nthe thin ice area to differ by \u00b16%. Likewise, the total ice\nproduction inside the open water zone varies by \u00b15%. The\nice growth per unit area in the open water zone differs by\n\u00b19%. An average uncertainty in wind velocity of \u00b10.5 m s\u22121\nwould influence the ice volume produced in the thin ice and\nopen water area by as much as \u00b18% and \u00b113%, respectively.\nThe error associated to the ice production per unit area in the\nopen water zone is less than the error associated to un-\ncertainties in air temperatures (\u00b15%).\n[54] Other important parameters that determine the ice\npartition are the frazil ice collection depth (H) and the\nvelocities of the ice edges (pack ice edge and open water\nedge, \u0004c). According to satellite observations made in the\narea north of the fast ice edge, the evolution of the outer\npack ice edge is well described by assuming it to be 1% of\nthe wind speed. However, the determination of the consol-\nidated new ice velocity (\u0004c = 3%) is highly parameterized\nand might change in space and time. We therefore varied \u0004c\nat the open water edge by a factor of \u00b11%. This significantly\nalters the evolution of the open water width. Consequently,\nthe associated error in ice production is higher for the open\nwater zone (\u00b135%) than for the thin ice zone (\u00b112%). The\nice production per unit area in the open water zone is not\naffected. Varying the parameterization for the collection\nTable 1.

[2000] by \u00b120% results\nin an ice formation variation of \u00b16% in the thin ice zone\nand \u00b118% in the open water zone. Again, the ice growth rate\nin the open water zone does not change.\n[55] The presence of a snow cover on young ice signifi-\ncantly reduces its growth rate. Varying the daily snow\naccumulation in the model by \u00b11 mm d\u22121 results in a thin ice\nproduction error of \u00b13%. If varying the cloud cover by a\nfactor of \u00b12\/8,the ice production in the open water area and\nice growth per unit area deviate by \u00b11%. Note that the\nthermodynamic formulation of the thin ice growth used in\nour model is rather simplified and does not include, e.g.,\nwind depended sensible heat fluxes. Hence, the computed\ntotal thin ice production is not affected by a varying cloud\ncover.\n[56] The dynamical formulation used in our model is\nbased on the assumption of convergent ice flow between the\nopen water edge and the outer pack ice edge. The ice\nthickening is governed by the equation of conservation of\nmass by assuming rafting to be limited to ice thinner than\n0.3 m and effects of compression on the thin ice zone to\ndecrease linearly with ice thickness. The error associated to\nthis highly idealized parameterization is tested by limiting\nrafting in a separate model run to ice classes thinner than 0.2\nand 0.4 m. However, the resultant variation of ice growth in\nthe thin ice zone was found to be negligibly small (\u00b11%).\n[57] The algorithms used to calculate heat flux, ice growth\nand salt rejection are based upon several empirical coeffi-\ncients. An evaluation of the errors associated to the use of\nspecific coefficients such as the bulk transfer coefficient or\nLs is beyond the scope of this study. At this point the authors\nrefer to the publication of Haarpaintner et al. [2001], where\nthis topic is covered in more detail.\n5. Effect of Ice Formation on the Water Column\nStratification\n[58] The total amount of salt rejected during the polynya\nevent in 2004 was estimated at about 2.9 \u00d7 1011 kg, of\nwhich 1.5 \u00d7 1011 kg were rejected in the open water area as\nfrazil ice was created. Figure 12 shows the daily averaged\nsalt rejection as a function of distance offshore from the fast\nice edge. Highest rates are released during frazil ice for-\nmation in areas near the fast ice edge, while fluxes related to\nthe thermodynamic growth of consolidated new ice further\noffshore are significantly lower.\n[59] If the amount of salt released and subsequent dense\nbrine rejected is high enough, the stratification of the shelf\nmay be temporarily eroded. Locally confined haline con-\nvection cells may then lead to the formation of dense shelf\nbottom water that accumulates over the shelf and eventually\nflows down the shelf break slope to form deep water\n[Backhaus et al., 1997]. Chapman and Gawarkiewicz\n[1997] and Chapman [1999] examined shallow convection\nand offshore transport of dense water from an idealized\ncoastal polynya using a theoretical approach. Model results\nsuggest that a baroclinically unstable front developes at the\nedge of the polynya. Dense water is then formed and\ntransported offshore in baroclinic eddies that develop along\nthis front. The role of polynyas in forming and dissemi-\nnating saline waters over the central Bering shelf was further\ninvestigated by Danielson et al. [2006] using 14 yearlong\nmoorings deployed south of St. Lawrence Island. In contrast\nto the theoretical prediction of Chapman and Gawarkiewicz\n[1997] and Chapman [1999], Danielson et al. [2006] found\nnegligible cross\u2010shelf eddy density fluxes within and sur-\nrounding shallow polynyas even though dense water accu-\nmulated within the polynya and large cross\u2010shore density\ngradients developed. The hydrographic response to the\npolynya activity in the southeastern Laptev Sea was recently\ninvestigated by [Dmitrenko et al., 2010b]. However, similar\nto Danielson et al. [2006] the authors found no baroclinic\ninstability and eddy formation along the fast ice edge,\nalthough the thermohaline front across the onshore polynya\nboundary was highly pronounced.\n[60] At present, the oceanographic processes contributing\nto density\u2010driven convection and formation of dense bottom\nwater on the southeastern Laptev Sea shelf are not fully\nunderstood. To examine whether density\u2010driven convection\nduring a strong polynya event penetrates to the bottom, we\ntherefore neglect any horizontal advection of dense water in\nour investigation. In this study, the impact of salt rejection\non the stratification of the water body is investigated by\nuniformly distributing the rejected salt (Figure 12) over a\nstagnant water body. Information on mean winter stratifi-\ncation and its standard deviation preconditioned by cyclonic\nsummers are derived from historical hydrographic data\n(section 3.3). Figure 13 shows the mean winter stratification\nof the water column and its STDV before and after the\npolynya event. Neglecting any currents, release of brines\nfrom freezing sea ice convectively erodes the pronounced\nseasonal halocline near the fast ice edge down to a depth of\n30 m (Figure 13, middle). Further offshore (5 and 10 km)\nthe convection depth is limited to 25 and 13 m water depth,\nrespectively. If instead of the mean winter stratification, we\nuse the mean winter stratification plus its STDV (Figure 13,\nleft), the shelf stratification can be fully mixed within a 5 km\ndistance from the fast ice edge. If we subtract, rather than\nadd, the STDV to the mean winter stratification (Figure 13,\nright) the density\u2010driven convective mixing depth is sig-\nnificantly reduced. Areas near the fast ice edge are eroded\ndown to a depth of 22 m. Further offshore, mixing is limited\nto 16 m (5 km offshore) and 10 m (10 km offshore) water\ndepth. To test if the penetration depth varies throughout the\npolynya area, we averaged hydrographic measurements made\nFigure 12.

However, the\nobtained climatological mean stratification patterns are very\nsimilar to the mean stratification pattern at the polynya center\n(not shown here). Consequently, the convective mixing\ndepths computed on the basis of mean stratification patterns\nare consistent throughout the polynya area.\n[61] The use of a mean climatological stratification plus\/\nminus its STDV to investigate if the water body gets fully\neroded during strong polynya events is admittedly some-\nwhat crude. The approach is merely exploratory, but suffi-\nciently rigorous, we expect, to provide a zero\u2010order estimate\nof the potential contribution of polynya events to winter\ndestratification. The mixed layer depths we report on in the\nprevious paragraph may probably be considered as upper\nbound estimates of destratification potential, as in our sim-\nulations, destratification is favored in a number of ways that\nwe enumerate in the following.\n[62] First, the sensitivity study has shown that largest errors\nin ice growth rates per unit area are associated to uncertainties\nin air temperatures. In the 2004 event simulation we applied\na NCEP\/DOE atmospheric data set that was shown to gen-\nerally underestimate air temperatures owing to the missing\nincorporation of the impact of polynyas on the atmospheric\ndata set (Ernsdorf et al., submitted manuscript, 2010). The\nincomplete representation of polynya processes results in an\noverestimation of polynya ice production, and consequently\nan overestimation of salt rejection rates. Second, as pointed\nout in section 5.2, the simulated polynya event was excep-\ntionally consistent with extreme ice formation and salt\nrejection rates. Third, the climatological mean density\nstratification used in this study to investigate the impact of\nice production on the water stratification was calculated by\naveraging salinity measurements made during winter sur-\nveys preconditioned for destratification by cyclonic sum-\nmers. In addition, the calculated mean stratification may\ncontain profiles that were taken during active polynya events\nand\/or have been weakened by preceding polynya activity.\nHowever, indentifying those profiles to exclude them from\nthe calculation is not possible, since potential polynya\nactivity has not always been documented. Note that most of\nthe profiles were obtained in the 70s and 80s, when the\nspatial resolution of satellites was too coarse to resolve\nsingle polynya events. We therefore expect the strength of\nthe mean vertical density gradient to be underestimated,\nrather than overestimated.\n[63] Figure 14 shows a series of single hydrographic\nmeasurements that were taken along and offshore the fast\nice edge during the TD VI expedition in April 1999. Fol-\nlowing Dmitrenko et al. [2005], the summer of 1998 was\npredominantly cyclonic with the third highest vorticity\nindex observed since 1948. By the time measurements were\nmade, the WNS polynya was closed. Note that compared to\nthe climatological mean stratification, the profiles shown in\nFigure 14 are characterized by a much stronger density\ngradient. Figure 14 shows the potential effect of the 2004\npolynya event on the water body, if the amount of salt\nreleased is integrated over the stratification of stations 1, 2,\nand 3. The deepest level of penetration is achieved at\nstation 1, located at the southern edge of the WNS polynya.\nNeglecting any currents, the stratification of the water body\nnear the fast ice edge is fully mixed. In the center of the\npolynya (station 3), the strength of the pycnocline is more\npronounced. As a consequence, a cross\u2010pycnocline mixing\nis prevented and penetration depth is limited to the upper\n13 m. Following Chapman and Gawarkiewicz [1997], one\ncould argue that baroclinic eddies eventually transport dense\nwater formed in open water zones offshore to areas with a\nless distinct density gradient. Here, mixing may occur local-\nized in chimneys or eddies. However, according toDmitrenko\net al. [2010b], the entire central part of the southeastern\nLaptev Sea is of generally low surface salinity. For example,\nstation 2 in Figure 14 shows the stratification that was\nFigure 13.

The strength of the pycnocline is as pro-\nnounced as at station 3, such that mixing is limited to the\nupper 20 m water depth.\n[64] Our assumption of a stagnant water body neglects the\nbackground current flow that eventually brings water of\ndifferent salinity to the WNS polynya. If the water origins\nfrom under the fast ice, as it was the case during TD VI, it\nadvects less saline water into the area of ice formation, and\nthus helps to restore stratification. An inclusion of these\nadvective processes in the model would further strengthen\nthe stability of the water column and would prevent density\u2010\ndriven convection to penetrate down to the bottom. In\ncontrast, the likelihood for deep mixing is increased, if an\nalongshore advection establish that brings water of higher\nsalinity from the Anabar or Taimyr polynya (Figure 1) into\nthe polynya area. Theoretically, this alongshore flow may\neven further increase its salinity while crossing the polynya\nfrom southwest to northeast.\n[65] Recent year\u2010round mooring observations made during\nthe period from September 2007 until September 2009 in the\nregion of the WNS polynya provide evidence that active\npolynya formation is usually accompanied by a sharp\ndecrease in near\u2010bottom water salinity and temperature\n[H\u00f6lemann et al., 2011]. These observations are inconsistent\nwith dense water formation by brine rejection and support\nour assumption that even during strong WNS polynya\nevents, ice production is not high enough to erode the hal-\nocline. H\u00f6lemann et al. [2011] suggest that the salinity\ndecrease is likely to be induced by a wind driven breakdown\nof the stratification and a cross\u2010pycnocline turbulent mixing,\nleading to an admixture of the brine enriched but still\nbuoyant surface waters to the more saline, and denser bot-\ntom waters (>25 m water depth). Up to know, vertical\nFigure 14. Effect of salt rejection on the stratification of the water body as observed at three different\nstations during TD VI in April 1999.

However, our results\nprovide indirect evidence that the mechanisms responsible\nfor the destratification and vertical mixing in the area around\nthe WNS polynya are predominantly wind\u2010 and tidally\ndriven, rather than convective. This has far\u2010reaching con-\nsequences for both the vertical and lateral distribution of\nnutrient, sediments, pollutants and heat.\n6. Conclusions\n[66] In this study, we investigate the ice formation that\ntook place during an exceptionally strong and consistent\nWNS polynya event in 2004. We further examine whether\nassociated salt rejection rates are high enough to establish a\ndensity\u2010driven convection that penetrates down to the bot-\ntom of the seafloor. Ice production rates were computed by\nmeans of a simple polynya model driven by standard\natmospheric forcing. The effect of salt rejection on the water\nbody is examined by adding the brine released during the\npolynya event to the average winter density stratification of\nthe water body preconditioned by summers with a cyclonic\natmospheric forcing. The model performance was also\ntested by applying it to the simulation of a well documented\nWNS polynya event in April 2008.\n[67] The simulation of the opening event in 2008 shows\nthat the model is capable of reproducing correctly the extent\nof the open water zone and the location of the pack ice edge.\nThe good agreement between the simulated thickness of the\nthin ice zone and estimates made by airborne surveys and\nAVHRR satellite indicates that the model is well tuned, and\nsuggests that the approach is a suitable tool to investigate the\ndynamics and export rates of flaw polynyas.\n[68] Applying the model to the strong polynya event in\n2004, results in a total ice volume production of 26 km3.\nThis corresponds to a brine release of 2.9 \u00d7 1011 kg.\nNeglecting the replenishment of water masses by advection\ninto the polynya area, the probability for the occurrence of\ndensity\u2010driven convection down to the bottom is low. This\ncan be explained by the distinct density gradient that char-\nacterize the area of the WNS polynya and the apparent lack\nof extreme events in the eastern Laptev Sea. The simple\napproach is expected to be sufficiently rigorous, since ice\nproduction and salt rejection rates are likely to be over-\nestimated owing to the incomplete representation of polynya\nprocesses in the atmospheric data set. Furthermore, the\nsimulated event is exceptionally consistent with extreme ice\nformation and salt rejection rates and the strength of the\nclimatological mean stratification pattern is likely to be\nunderestimated, rather than overestimated. Our findings are\nsupported by mooring\u2010based observations in the WNS\npolynya that show that large polynya openings are usually\nassociated with a decrease in near\u2010bottom water salinity and\ntemperature at water depth greater than 25 m, which is\npredominantly related to wind\u2010 and tidally driven turbulent\nmixing of the water column. This (the absence of convective\nmixing down to the seabed and subsequent dense water\nformation) has far\u2010reaching consequences on the today\u2019s\nunderstanding of energy and matter transport on the eastern\nLaptev Sea shelf.\n[69] Understanding how the stratification of shallow shelf\nwater and the ice production and salt rejection in polynyas\nmight change in a warming climate is one of the major\nchallenges of current polar research. On the one hand, it is\nlikely, that the stability of the halocline will be strengthened\nby an increase in the Siberian river discharge [Bethke et al.,\n2006; Peterson et al., 2006]. Rising Arctic surface tempera-\ntures [Chapman and Walsh, 2007] will probably weaken ice\nproduction and increase summer sea ice melt, further pro-\nmoting the stability of the halocline. On the other hand, the\nobserved positive trend in summer cyclonicity over the\nEurasian Arctic [Simmonds et al., 2008; Simmonds and\nKeay, 2009] might destabilize the water column (change\nthe water column structure). Likewise, a decrease in ice\nproduction could be compensated by an increase in polynya\nactivity during the freeze up period and in early spring\n[Willmes et al., 2011] caused by an increase in the frequency\nand strength of cyclones penetrating into the Eurasian Arctic\n[Zhang et al., 2004].\n[70] Clearly, we are far from being able to formulate\nsound predictions of how polynya formation and water\ncolumn stratification will respond to climatic change.\nUnderstanding and quantifying this response are key tasks\nfor future shelf process studies. To draw inferences on the\nphysical behavior of polynyas, under the premise that the\nclimate in the Arctic is changing, a numerical approach is\nneeded. Nevertheless, our results show that an alteration of\nmechanisms responsible for vertical mixing in the WNS\npolynya would require a strong increase in ice production\nand\/or a significant weakening of the year\u2010round density\nstratification.\n[71] Acknowledgments.
