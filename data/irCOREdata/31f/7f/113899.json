The  use   of   the\nSWNT\/ferritin film as an amperometric biosensor was demonstrated by sensing 1.0  mM  ascorbic\nacid in phosphate buffered saline solution with a sensitivity of  767  (A\/mg.  It  demonstrated  that\nferritin protein bound to SWNTs enhances the oxidation reaction of ascorbic acid over 11-fold.  \nKeywords; ferritin, carbon nanotube, ascorbic acid, non-covalent immobilisation\n1. Introduction\nFerritin, a spherical iron-storage protein, containing 24 peptide subunits, with an outer diameter of\n12 nm and inner diameter of 8 nm can sequester up to 4500 iron atoms in the  core,  with  the  iron\nstored in the Fe (III) oxidation state. Ferritin can control the appropriate level of iron  in  the  body\nby releasing iron through channels which link the interior to the  exterior  of  the  shell  [1-3].  The\nprotein  is  remarkably  robust,  able  to  withstand  biological  extremes  of  pH  (2.0  ~  10.0)  and\ntemperatures  up  to  70(C.  Examples  of  recent  applications  of  ferritin   include   their   use   in\nnanoparticles [4], nano-bio batteries [5-6], fuel cells and bio sensors [7-10]. \nCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted a lot of attention due  to  their  potential  in  a  variety  of\napplications:  structural,  mechanical,  electrical  and  electromechanical  [11].  These  applications\nhave considerable use in the area of sensors [12-13], high strength conductive composite materials\n[14-15], fuel cells and hydrogen-storage media  [16-17].  One  possible  approach  to  improve  the\nperformance of biosensor materials is the interaction of the  biomolecule  of  interest  with  CNTs.\nSince ferritin can be dispersed in polar matrices,  combining  ferritin  with  SWNTs  enhances  the\nnanotube interaction with water and allows for the dispersion of SWNTs in aqueous solution [18].\n Indeed, the affinity of CNTs for proteins has  been  observed  and  documented  in  the  literature.\nMany  applications  of  these  compounds  have  been  investigated,   including   the   catalysis   of\nascorbate  oxidation  [19],  and  enhanced  mechanical  properties  of  polymers  by   incorporating\nferritin-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) [18].\nAscorbate,  a  water-soluble  vitamin  known  for  its  antioxidant  properties   has   more   recently\nemerged as a  potentially  important  modulator  of  striatal  function  [20].  The  determination  of\nascorbate  is  therefore  of  significant  interest  because  of  its   functions   in   physiological   and\npathological processes. Increasing evidence suggests  that,  apart  from  scavenging  free  radicals,\nascorbate  influences  synaptic  function  [21]  and  plays  an  important  role   in   neuroprotection\n[20]. Previously, ferritin immobilised on a gold electrode was applied to electrocatalytically detect\nascorbic acid [22].\nIn the present study, ferritin protein was immobilised non-covalently on SWNTs. Here  we  report\nthe preparation and characterization of a SWNT\/ferritin composite electrode and its application  in\nenhancing the oxidation of ascorbic acid.\n2. Experimental\nSingle-wall carbon nanotubes (Carbon Nanotechnologies,  Inc,  Houston),  ferritin  (Type  I:  from\nHorse Spleen, sterile filtered solution in 0.15 M  NaCl,  Sigma),  phosphate  buffer  saline  (Fluka)\nand L-ascorbic acid (BioChemika Ultra, ( 99.5% (RT), Fluka) were used as  received.  Indium  tin\noxide (ITO) coated glass was purchased from Delta Technologies Ltd. (USA).  The ITO glass was\nwashed with acetone overnight and treated in an  UVO-cleaner  (Model  No.  42-220,  Jelight  Co.\nInc., USA) for 30 minutes before use.\nElectrochemical testing of the SWNT\/ferritin electrode was  performed  using  an  electrochemical\nhardware system comprising  of  an  EG&G  PAR  363  Potentiostat\/Galvanostat,  a  Bioanalytical\nSystems CV27 Voltammograph, a MacLab 400 with Chart v. 3.5.7\/EChem v. 1.3.2 software  (AD\nInstruments). All electrochemical experiments were performed  at  room  temperature  in  a  three-\nelectrode cell. The ITO substrate was used as the working electrode with ferritin, SWNTs and  the\nSWNT\/ferritin  composite  cast  as  a  film  on  the  cleaned  surface.  An  Ag\/AgCl  electrode  and\nplatinum mesh were used as the reference and the auxiliary electrode, respectively.\nUV-visible spectra of the samples  were  examined  over  the  range  of  300-1100  nm  (Shimadzu\nUV1601 spectrophotometer). The zeta-potential and size measurement of all dispersions used was\nmeasured  using  a  Zetasizer  Nano  3600  (Malvern  instruments).  The   Raman   spectra   of   all\ncompounds were studied using  Raman  spectroscopy  (LabSpec(  Software,  Jobin  Yvon,  Horiba\nGroup, France). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed using a Philips\nCM200 microscope, (200 kV).\nThe SWNT\/ferritin composite was prepared by mixing 10 mg SWNTs with 100 mg ferritin  in  10\nml  deionized  water  and  sonicating  for  an  hour.  Following  dispersion,  100  (l  of   the   stable\nSWNT\/ferritin suspension was cast as a film onto ITO (0.5 x 0.5 cm2  test  area).  As  controls,  10\nmg  SWNTs  was  dispersed  in  10  ml  water  using  the  same  conditions  as  the  SWNT\/ferritin\ncomposite and 100 (l of this suspension and 100 (l of a concentrated ferritin (85  mg\/mL)  solution\nwere cast onto separate ITO substrates.\n3. Results and discussion\nThe absorption spectra of films of ferritin, SWNTs and SWNT\/ferritin were examined  using  UV-\nvis spectroscopy (Figure 1). A clear absorption peak from ferritin was  observed  around  380  nm,\nwith the well known absorption peaks of the SWNTs  van  Hove  singularities  occurring  between\n500-1000 nm [23]. The composite of ferritin and SWNTs shows a shift in the absorption spectrum\ncompared to ferritin and\/or SWNTs alone. The  absorption  peaks  for  the  ferritin  protein  in  the\nSWNT\/ferritin composite occurred at 360 nm (20 nm red shift) and 470-680 nm for SWNTs.  The\nshift in the absorption peaks of the SWNTs in the composite may be due to selective interaction of\nthe SWNTs with ferritin, as has been previously observed with biomolecules and SWNTs [23].\nRaman spectroscopy was performed on films of ferritin, SWNTs  and  SWNT\/ferritin  (Figure  2).\nNo Raman peaks are observed on a bare ferritin film due to the strong fluorescence observed.  The\nRaman spectra of the RBM (~ 170-310 cm-1), D band (~ 1350  cm-1)  and  G  band  (~  1550-1605\ncm-1) of SWNTs film with and without ferritin can provide information on  the  SWNTs  structure\n[24]. The D and G bands of the SWNTs film were measured  at  1311  cm-1  (D),  1548  and  1587\ncm-1 (G), respectively. The D and G Raman bands obtained from SWNT\/ferritin occurred at  1324\n(D) and 1555, 1592 cm-1 (G), respectively. The shifts in the Raman bands due to  the  presence  of\nferritin suggest that the ferritin molecules interact with the  SWNTs.  To  confirm  this  interaction\nthe peaks in the RBM region in both SWNTs  and  SWNT\/ferritin  samples  were  examined.  The\nRBM band positions of SWNTs differ from the SWNT\/ferritin composite film by between 5.0 and\n2.5 cm-1 respectively [25]. These observations are consistent with de-bundling  of  the  SWNTs  as\nhas been previously reported [26-27].\nThe  stability   and   charge   of   the   dispersions   used   was   investigated   using   zeta-potential\nmeasurements. The average size and charge (3 measurements) of ferritin measured using dynamic\nlight scattering and zeta-potential measurements were 11 nm  and  -20.13  mV,  respectively.  This\nsize measurement was confirmed by TEM microscopy. The SWNTs  dispersion  was  observed  to\nbe negatively charged (-15.49 mV) presumably due to the carboxy  groups  on  SWNTs  that  arise\nfrom  the  purification  processes  used.  An   overall   negative   charge   was   measured   for   the\nSWNT\/ferritin composite as expected, with a value  of  -43.09  mV  (>-30mV)  which  indicates  a\nmore stable dispersion than that of the SWNTs alone.\nThe  insert  B  in  Fig.2  shows  a  TEM  micrograph  of  the  SWNT\/ferritin   composite.   Ferritin\nmolecules were observed and attached to SWNTs bundles. Individual  SWNTs  do  not  appear  to\nsupport the ferritin molecules, which is not surprising given the size of the ferritin molecules (~ 13\nnm), compared to the SWNTs (~1 nm). Ferritin disperses the SWNTs well in solution, resulting in\na smaller SWNTs bundle size than without the protein. These observations are consistent with  the\nde-bundling observed with Raman spectroscopy.\nFigure  3  shows  the  cyclic  voltammograms  obtained  from  a  ferritin  film  and  SWNT\/ferritin\ncomposite film on ITO coated glass, in PBS buffer solution as electrolyte (pH 7.4). No clear redox\nresponses were observed at the ferritin (only) ITO coated glass electrode possibly due to  the  lack\nof electronic connection between the ferritin film  and  ITO  coated  glass  electrode  and  also  the\nwater soluble nature of ferritin (insert in Figure 3). A stable redox couple (labelled peaks A (+0.05\nV) & B (-0.38 V)) is observed from the SWNT\/ferritin ITO coated glass electrode, which  may  be\nassigned to the ferritin moiety in  the  composite  [2].  This  suggests  that  there  is  an  interaction\nbetween  the  ferritin  protein  and  the  SWNTs  in   the   composite   which   enhances   both   the\nelectrochemical response and the stability of ferritin. The SWNTs in the composite  may  act  both\nas an anchor for the ferritin and a 1D-nanochannel for the electron transfer of the protein.\nThe  electrocatalytic  oxidation  of  ascorbic  acid  using  the   SWNT\/ferritin   ITO   coated   glass\nelectrode was demonstrated via  cyclic  voltammetry  (Figure  4)  in  PBS  buffer  solution.  Figure\n4 shows a well-defined oxidation peak of ascorbic acid at + 0.38 V upon the addition  of  1.0  mM\nascorbic acid (Figure 4a), while no signal was observed in  the  absence  of  ascorbic  acid  (Figure\n4b)  at  the  SWNT\/ferritin  composite  electrode.   This  suggests  that  the  ferritin  moiety  in  the\ncomposite electrocatalysed the oxidation of the ascorbic acid.\nDetailed amperometric detection test was performed in  a  stirred  buffer  solution  (rotating  speed\n1000 rpm) potentiostatically at +0.30 V (vs. Ag\/AgCl) using both SWNTs and SWNT\/ferritin ITO\ncoated glass electrodes. Ascorbic acid (1.0 mM)  was  added  once  the  current  reached  a  steady\nstate. Figure 5 shows  a  typical  amperometric  response  obtained  from  the  SWNT\/ferritin  ITO\ncoated glass electrode upon the  addition  of  ascorbic  acid  (1.0  mM).  It  shows  that  the  anodic\ncurrent at the SWNT\/ferritin electrode increased sharply after the addition of ascorbic acid  with  a\nresponse time of less than 3 seconds, while no response was observed at a SWNTs  only  electrode\n(without ferritin) under  identical  conditions.  The  presence  of  SWNTs  with  ferritin  shows  an\nincrease in current response from 70 (A\/mg (SWNTs itself) to 767 (A\/mg (SWNT\/ferritin),  which\nis approximately 11 times of that of the pure SWNTs. The increased current  clearly  demonstrates\nthe beneficial effect of SWNTs on the electrochemical properties of  ferritin.  This  indicates  that,\nfor  the  detection  of  ascorbic  acid,  the  presence  of  SWNTs  in  the  SWNT\/ferritin  composite\nsignificantly  enhances  the  oxidation  reaction  of  ascorbic  acid.  Further   investigation   of   the\noxidation of ascorbic acid was carried out by sequential additions of  1.0  mM  ascorbic  acid  into\nPBS buffer solution using the SWNT\/ferritin electrode (the insert in Fig.5). It can be observed that\nthe current increased continuously with sequential additions of ascorbic  acid.  This  suggests  that\nthe SWNT\/ferritin composite could be used as a potential sensor material for  the  electrochemical\ndetection of ascorbic acid.\n4. Conclusion \nIn summary, a uniform dispersion of a SWNT\/ferritin composite has  been  successfully  prepared.\nElectrochemical   studies   on   SWNT\/ferritin   composite   films   were   carried    out    including\namperometric  detection  of  ascorbic  acid.  The   results   obtained   from   UV-Vis   and   Raman\nspectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and TEM imaging provide evidence of the  interaction  between\nSWNTs  and  ferritin.  This  type  of  SWNT\/ferritin  composite  displays  a  stable   amperometric\nresponse to ascorbic acid; demonstrating its promise as a biosensor material. \nAcknowledgement\nFinancial support from the Commission on Higher Education of the Government of Thailand,  and\nfrom the Faculty of Science  at  Chiang  Mai  University,  Thailand  and  the  Australian  Research\nCouncil (ARC) are gratefully acknowledged.\nReferences\n[1] Y.
