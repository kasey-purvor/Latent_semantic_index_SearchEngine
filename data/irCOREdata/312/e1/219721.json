The project \nillustrates how technology opens up various possibilities that may influence \npharmacists\u2019 professional standing by shaping their work practices, \njurisdictions, roles, values, power and boundaries. The aim here is not to \nevaluate these subtle and contradictory changes, which are in the future, but to \ndevelop an appropriate analytical framework, and to contribute to a debate \nconcerning the role of technology in shaping professional futures.  \nKeywords: professionals, technology, community pharmacy, electronic \nprescriptions  \n1   Introduction \nThe future is already here - it is just unevenly distributed.  \n(attributed to William Gibson) \n \nInformation and communication technology (ICT) has in the last decade been \nextensively proposed as a means to reform, modernize and even reshape national \nhealth systems. Adoption of ICT based systems is expected to achieve cost-\neffectiveness, support clinical decision making, improve patients\u2019 privacy and safety, \nspeed-up delivery and improve the quality of healthcare [1],[2],[3]. Adopting ICT is \nhowever not without consequences; ICT based systems challenge health \nprofessionals\u2019 work practices, the roles they occupy, the types of knowledge they use \nand the modes of collaboration they employ [4]. The focus of this paper is on the \n possibilities that ICT opens up for reshaping pharmacy professionals\u2019 work, in \nparticular that of the community pharmacist. Community pharmacists are those who \nserve the public in high street shops, supermarkets and some medical centres. They \nconstitute the largest subgroup within the overall pharmacy profession, which \nincludes also hospital pharmacists who provide clinical advice to hospitals and \nhealthcare professionals and those who work in pharmaceutical research. From now \non reference to pharmacy(-ists) will imply community pharmacy(-ists).  \nOur account here is a possible projection of professionalism in the future that is \ncreated from research interviews and by an amalgamation of people\u2019s recollections of \nthe past, experiences from the present and expectations for the future. The motivation \nfor the paper is found in the introduction of the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) \ninto primary care in the English NHS. This is a national programme to allow doctors \nto send electronic prescriptions to community pharmacists, and pharmacists \nsubsequently to send them on for reimbursement by the NHS1. The basic \ninfrastructure for the project \u2013 networks, software, databases, and new operating \nprocedures, are well under way. Phase 2 of the programme which will see the legal \nprescription shifting from singed paper to an electronically signed electronic message \nis rolling out through 2010. Thus ICT is taking on a stronger role as a mediator of the \ngeneration, transmission and receipt of prescriptions between doctors and community \npharmacists, as well as serving the processes of reimbursement. We are interested \nhere in exploring the role of this new technical intervention in shaping the pharmacy \nprofession and in particular those members who work in community pharmacies. To \ndo so we draw upon a part of our current research evaluating the adoption of EPS2. \nWe develop two particular arguments in this paper. First, we propose that EPS can \nshape six aspects of pharmacists\u2019 work; work practices, values, roles, jurisdictions, \nexercise of power and location of boundaries. Second, we see the consequences of \nthis technology for the pharmacy profession are multiple and often contradictory; on \nsome occasions technology strengthens and expands pharmacists\u2019 professional \nstanding by fostering their values and expanding their jurisdictions, opening up \nopportunities for re-professionalisation. On other occasions technology blurs \npharmacists\u2019 role, enables electronic monitoring of their outputs and challenges their \nprofessional boundaries by allowing new business models and logics to emerge, \nconditioning in that way possible de-professionalisation. We propose a framework \nthat depicts how and in what ways ICT might shape the community pharmacy \nprofession.  \nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents our theoretical framework \ndrawing upon the sociology of professionals, critical studies on technology and \nsecondary studies on pharmacists\u2019 profession. Section 3 describes our research \nmethodology. Section 4 provides an account of our research into EPS which is \nfollowed by a discussion. The paper ends with some concluding remarks. \n \n                                                \n1 http:\/\/www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk\/systemsandservices\/eps \n2 Reference to be added \n 2   Theoretical Framework  \n2.1   Conceptualising Professionalism \nProfessions constitute \u2018\u2026homogeneous group of occupations sharing a unique \ncharacter and destiny\u2019 [5] and are structured in line with certain mechanisms. First, \nprofessionals are typically organised into associations, which are established in order \nto promote and protect their interests and rights [6]. Second, professional associations \ndefine the skills needed in order to become a legitimate member, establish \u2018career \npatterns\u2019 and set up mechanisms that regulate entrance and operation in their \nprofession [6],[7],[8],[9]. Implicit in this is the establishment of norms, values, and \nstandards of occupational behaviour, what is understood as professional conduct [10]. \nThe process of establishing a profession (professionalisation) is therefore a boundary-\nmaking process that binds professionals under a specific regime of work [11],[12]. \nProfessionalisation is both a process of enactment, in as far as it depends on \nindividuals acting their assigned roles as professionals, and a process of \nsubjectification during which individuals are \u2018made-up\u2019 as professionals [13].  \nFor Abbott [14] the most distinctive characteristic of professionals is the \nabstractification of their knowledge which distinguishes professionals\u2019 claims from \nthose of ordinary technical work [11]. This differentiation serves to create a \nrelationship of dependence between professionals and laymen [5] and is thought to \n(re-)produce professionals\u2019 power and authority [15]. Thus, abstract knowledge \nlegitimises professionals\u2019 status and prestige because it is typically associated with \nscience, logic and future practical value. Of course professionals also undertake \nmundane tasks, rendering their work a hybrid of conceptual and manual activities \n[16]. \nProfessional groups are expected to exercise high degrees of power and authority \n[17]. The power they exercise can be defined as the ability to \u2018retain jurisdiction\u2019 [6] \ne.g. to make decisions based upon \u2018internalised norms and expert knowledge\u2019 \n[18],[9], influence policy and decide on their remuneration [19]. Professional power is \nlargely dependent upon the state\u2019s support by, for instance, defining the type and \nmode of services they alone can offer [20].  \nIndividual professionals\u2019 power in institutional settings is influenced by specific \nstandards, code of ethics and behavioural norms drawn from the profession but also, \nto degrees, from their employing organisations [21],[20]. Professionals\u2019 power can be \nfurther limited by clients\u2019 ability to organise themselves into powerful groups that set \nrequirements, pursue their rights and demand certain types of service [5].  \n2.2   (Re-) Constructing Professionals through Information Technology \n \nThe introduction of ICT in any work setting promotes changes to work practices, \nroles and identities. Typically ICT is used to gather, maintain, process and \ndisseminate data and information across temporal and spatial boundaries. ICT can \nachieve a parallel centralization and decentralization of data and information as it \n renders it available to anyone, anywhere [22],[23],[24]. Further, such data can be \nstatistically processed, ranked, compared, accumulated and inscribed into reports, \ngenerating in that way new types of information with new uses and users \n[7],[25],[26], [24]. One significant way in which ICT influences professionals\u2019 work \nis by rendering their outputs visible [27] for example concerning work aspects such as \nperformance, outputs, time and date of work, and history of activities. This then \nrenders professionals \u2018legible\u2019, in particular to managers [28]. This transparency that \ntechnology provides enables constant surveillance and control, which in turn may \ninfluence reward structures and hence the way in which professionals do their work. \nFor instance Aarts et al (2007) [4] describe how the introduction of Computerised \nPhysician Order Entry (CPOE) system impersonalized healthcare professionals\u2019 \ncollaboration and made nurses lose visibility of, and thus power over, aspects of their \nwork.  \nICT is also used to automate processes and practices [22] with implications of \nsimplification, rule following and tasks undertaken without human knowledge, \njudgment or discretion. This promotes predictability, quantification and centrally \ncontrolled rule-based decision making [29]. Automation is often associated with \nattempts to de-skill professionals and undermine their claims to professional status \n[27].  \nBeyond automation ICT intervenes in work organisations in order to transform \nwork processes [22]. In these cases, ICT is not always perceived as a machine that \nautomates but may be seen as an intervention that \u2018informates\u2019 work [24]. It does so \nby eliminating unnecessary activities, undertaking mundane tasks and then providing \nback to professionals processed information upon which they can act. In this way, \nICT serves professionals in decision making and may encourage them to develop new \ncapacities as they exploit the value of this new information [30]. This then conditions \npossibilities for re-skilling by expanding the breadth and depth of their responsibilities \n[24]. Thus in a study of a Health Information system in a cardiology department Cho \net al (2008) [31] found that ICT provided opportunities for re-skilling nurses by \nallowing them to download patients\u2019 images and discuss them with doctors during \nward rounds. \n2.3   Pharmacists as Health Professionals \nUnlike other clinical professions, pharmacists do not specialise in specific parts of the \nbody and do not directly intervene in the body [32]. Their work is fundamentally \ntechnological3 [11] in that it deals at the primary level with material objects, namely \nchemical components and models, delivery devices, medications, prescriptions, \ntokens. What distinguishes pharmacists from other healthcare professionals who are \ninvolved with medicines is their knowledge (abstractification) about the ingredients of \nmedicines, the way in which they work in the body and their effects on it. This \nknowledge constitutes for Barber (2005) [32] the \u2018pharmaceutical gaze\u2019. Another \ncritical feature of community pharmacists working in the high street is their hybrid \n                                                \n3 Technological is defined here as a techne i.e. the ability to use expertise and techniques in \norder to achieve particular objectives  \n role as both healthcare professionals with clinical expertise, jurisdictions and social-\nservice orientation, and as business owners who look for the future viability of their \nbusiness [27],[19],[33],[34]. The intrusion of the business orientation into \npharmacists\u2019 profession is thought by some to condition de-skilling and \nstandardisation, leading to the rise of what Bush et al (2009) [27] described as the \n\u2018McPharmacist\u2019. \nNonetheless, through their training and their enactment of professionalization \npharmacists tend to follow a scientific and rational model of thinking and acting that \ndraws largely upon the law, and their own codes, rules and standard operating \nprocedures and policy guidelines [21],[35],[9]. The profession is driven by two major \nvalues. The first is the value of managing medicines in a safe and reliable way [21], \nthe second is treating the patient as a person with particular needs, values, culture and \nbeliefs.   \nIn practices, however, pharmacists\u2019 work is not as \u2018rational\u2019 and normative as it \nmay look from the outside. Benson et al (2009) [21] present a number of examples \nwhich illustrate how pharmacists work in a non-prescriptive way in their attempt to \ndeal professionally with complex situations. For instance, pharmacists often need to \nbend the rules in order to treat a patient in a \u2018better\u2019 way or they may ration services \nby prioritising some patients over others [21].  \nTraditionally pharmacists\u2019 skills and expertise is founded on finding and \ncombining the right ingredients in order to compound medicines [11],[36],[19]. \nIndustrialisation and increasing regulation of medicines reduced some medical risks, \nautomated the production of many medicines, thereby increasing it, and led to the \ncreation of new drugs with new adverse effects [32],[27],[19]. These changes limited \nthe involvement of pharmacists in the production of drugs, which was now the \nresponsibility of drug manufacturers [27], and reduced pharmacists\u2019 work to labeling \nand record keeping [11] and their role to \u2018mere dispensers\u2019 [35]. However, in the last \nfew years the community pharmacists\u2019 role has been reconsidered and some have \nargued for it to be transformed from a \u2018product-focused\u2019 [37] profession into a more \nclinical profession with new responsibilities for the management of prescriptions, \ncommon ailments and long-term illness, and for the provision of medical advice on \nhealthy lifestyles [11],[21].  \nSince the 1980s the English NHS has undertaken a number of initiatives in an \nattempt to re-professionalise pharmacists such as campaigns that prompt patients to \nturn to pharmacists for medical advice and initiatives to use their skills in order to \nassess patients\u2019 use and experience from medicines [35]. These initiatives however \nhave not been successful in substantially strengthening the pharmacists\u2019 profession. It \nhas been suggested that this is because community  pharmacists\u2019 often have \ninsufficient skills to undertake clinical responsibilities, the risk of potential conflicts \nwith doctors, and their general weak professional power to shape public policy \n[11],[27],[19]. In contrast to such concerns about community pharmacists potential a \nrecent official report on hospital doctor prescribing errors4 acknowledged that almost \nall errors are detected and corrected by pharmacists, illustrating the high level of \nclinical practice found in hospitals. \n                                                \n4 http:\/\/www.gmc-\nuk.org\/FINAL_Report_prevalence_and_causes_of_prescribing_errors.pdf_28935150.pdf \n 3   Research Methodology  \nThis research drew upon the qualitative paradigm [38],[39] and specifically \ninterpretivism [40],[41]. This paper draws upon data gathered through interviews as \nwell as documents. 19 interviews were conducted with a number of different \norganisations and their representatives involved in EPS such as software suppliers for \ndispensing systems, community pharmacists, clinical and local EPS leads, \nrepresentatives of pharmacists\u2019 associations, and representatives of Connecting for \nHealth, the agency commissioned by the Department of Health to manage EPS. \nInterviews took place from June 2009 until March 2010. They were semi-structured, \nrecorded and when this was not possible notes were kept. Interviews lasted 60 \nminutes on average and were transcribed (when possible) verbatim. We drew also \nupon recent government documents and reports concerning pharmacy its future, \ncontractual arrangements and business and workflow models. Documents were \nimportant in enriching our understanding of the context and substantiating the \narguments that derive from our primary data.  \nInterview transcripts and notes from documents were continuously read leading to \nbroad themes and sub-themes. These were then compared and contrasted with \nsecondary studies [38]. Out of comparisons, some themes were merged, eliminated, \nfurther developed and refined. The sections that follow present our findings from \ninterviews and documents. \n4   The Case of the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) \n4.1   The Introduction of EPS in English Community Pharmacy \nIn England community pharmacies are contracted by the NHS to provide \npharmaceutical services in the local community [35]. Their function is influenced by a \nnumber of other organisations responsible for working with them and protecting \npharmacists\u2019 interests at a national and local level (National Pharmacy Association, \nLocal Pharmaceutical Committees), negotiating their contractual obligations \n(Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee) and reimbursing them (Prescription \nPricing Authority). Community pharmacies are paid to deliver NHS services and have \na contract to do so, just like family doctors who work in their own businesses. Yet, \ntheir relation to the NHS is at times a contested area; one of our respondents described \ncommunity pharmacists as being \u2018\u2026in name only part of the NHS family\u2019 reflecting a \nview of them as independent enterprises or parts of multiple retailers rather than \nessentially of the health care system [33]. However, in most cases the majority of \ntheir income derives from fulfilling prescriptions for the NHS and their vey existence \nis largely dependent upon NHS policy decisions which often open up critical business \nissues for them.  \nThe EPS was started in 2003. It is a part of the National Programme for IT (NPfIT) \nfor the NHS in England, which is delivered by the Department of Health agency \nConnecting for Health (CfH). EPS refers to the electronic generation, transmission \n and receipt of prescriptions from a prescribing authority (e.g. doctor or nurse) to a \ndispensing authority (e.g. community pharmacist). EPS is being rolled-out in two \nreleases. The first (EPS1) aimed to set up and test the central infrastructure and the \nsecond (EPS2) to achieve a paperless and fully electronic transmission of \nprescriptions5. EPS2 also introduced new electronic functionalities: electronic \ncancellation, repeat dispensing of prescriptions, and pharmacy nomination. We \nexplore the last two and their potential consequences for pharmacists\u2019 professional \nwork in the following sub-sections. \nWith EPS electronic prescriptions are sent via a central server, the Spine, which is \nlinked to community pharmacies and general practices via the NHS own network N3. \nThe Spine holds some patient demographic information and it is planned one day to \nhold a summary care record of each patient - the subject of another NPfIT project \n[42]. The spine is supported by a message handler and a broker whose role is to \nintegrate and ensure consistency between the messages being exchanged. Prerequisite \nfor accessing the Spine is EPS-compliant local systems and role-based access through \npersonal users\u2019 smartcards. A number of manufacturers of software systems for both \ndoctors and pharmacies have modified or are modifying their systems in line with \ncentrally set specifications, to enable the creation and exchange of electronic \nprescriptions. EPS has been envisioned as a project that will bring considerable \nbenefits to pharmacists\u2019 work such as cost reduction, legible prescriptions, faster \ndispensing process, faster access to information and time savings6. Most importantly \nfor this paper, EPS opens up opportunities for (re-)shaping the professional role of the \npharmacist within community settings by intervening in pharmacists\u2019 work practices, \nvalues and their business. This is discussed below. \n4.2   Changing Pharmacists\u2019 Work Practices through EPS  \nIdeally, the introduction of EPS will automate aspects of the dispensing process (for \nexample labelling) and reduce the amount of paper that is generated. In theory \nelectronic prescription messages can be downloaded from the Spine and accessed and \ndispensed by any EPS-enabled community pharmacy across the country. It has been \noften argued that eliminating handwriting  makes prescriptions more legible, and thus \nsafer whilst also reducing the associated costs of paper5. A paperless process (or paper \nlight) implies that pharmacists will dispense from information presented on screen.  \nIn the non-EPS world the time of dispensing is mainly defined by the patient at the \npoint of his or her request. Under EPS, dispensing becomes temporally dispersed; it \ncan in theory start as soon as the prescription message is forwarded to a pharmacy. \nEPS2 allows repeat dispensing, the issuing of multiple instances of the same \nprescription for a patient to collect at the pharmacy as and when medication runs out, \nwithout the patient having to request a new prescription from the doctor each time6. \nThrough repeat dispensing pharmacists may be able to pre-dispense and so manage \n                                                \n5 EPS Release 2 Business Guidance for Initial implementers, April 2009. \nhttp:\/\/www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk\/systemsandservices\/eps\/staff\/guidance\/release2guide.pd\nf \n6 Pharmacy in England: Building on strengths-delivering the future, White Paper, 2008 \n better their stock and time, reduce patient waiting time and potentially keep a patient \nas a repeat customer.  \nThe prescription message populates the local computer record with patients\u2019 \ndemographic details as well as the prescribed items reducing the need to enter this \ninformation for a patient who arrives at the pharmacy while ensuring data \nconsistency. At the same time it may make a pharmacy\u2019s daily functions more \ndependent upon complex technology and infrastructures (N3, Spine, doctors software \netc.). In case of a technological breakdown, pharmacies\u2019 function is likely to be \nbrought to a halt with patients redirected to other dispensers (with possibly significant \nbusiness implications).  \n4.3   Changing the Values of Pharmacy Work \nSome interviewees described EPS as a means to render the relationship between \ndoctors and pharmacists less dependent on personal acquaintance and familiarisation. \nA representative of a pharmacists\u2019 association argued that in the pre-EPS model the \npharmacist who encountered a prescription error would, after a discussion with the \ndoctor perhaps by phone, dispense the correct medication and wait for the correct \nprescription to arrive in retrospect. This process leaves the pharmacist in a limbo both \nlegally and financially and renders professional trust essential. In the EPS world, \nhowever, when error is detected and changes agreed with the doctor, the pharmacist \ncan expect the doctor to send in real time a new prescription \u2013 and indeed may not \nfeel able to proceed until it is done. This manifests the secondary role that personal \ntrust plays when communication between professionals is mediated by computers. As \na community pharmacist told us: \n\u2018\u2026at the moment I receive a prescription which clearly has an error I attach a \nnote to that prescription, possibly write a note on it and send it back to the surgery \ntelling the error and the reasons for the error. If you just cancel a prescription \u2013 \nwhich is effectively what you are doing by sending it back to the spine , then \u2026 they \nbecome disconnected, which actually adds another weakness to the system possibly.\u2019 \nIn contrast to this view, other interviewees argued that EPS could be a mechanism \nthat fosters trust between doctors and pharmacists through the functionality of repeat \ndispensing. In this case, as described above, doctors rely on pharmacists to dispense \nthe correct medication, advise on the correct dosages, pick up patient concerns or \nqueries, and continue dispensing for the prescribed period of time. Further, a \ndispensing software supplier argued that the possibilities for electronic monitoring \nthat EPS enables could potentially allow doctors to monitor whether (or not) their \nprescriptions have been dispensed, fostering trust, though this functionality is not a \npart of  EPS2. \nSome participants highlighted the risks that may emerge as a prescription message \ngets modified while being transferred from a doctor to a pharmacist. This can be a \nmajor concern due to the different prescribing and dispensing software systems in use \nand their use of different dictionaries - especially in relation to how medicines and \ntheir dosages are coded. A dispensing software supplier explained: \n \u2018You don\u2019t have the proof of a piece of paper and the GP sees on his screen that \nhe\u2019s typing out Gaviscon for instance, but what is actually sent in the message, he \ndoesn\u2019t see that\u2026\u2019 \nSome participants suggested that pharmacists will be rendered liable for addressing \nthese risks as they make their professional judgement about items they dispense \nwithout having all the necessary knowledge, such as patient history and current \ntreatment. Professional judgement is also required with the current paper-based \nsystem, but the feeling expressed was that EPS could increase the volume of such \ncases. \nThe other new functionality that EPS2 provides is \u2018nomination\u2019 \u2013 a term coined to \nrefer to a patient\u2019s choice as to which pharmacy to use. Patients are given the \nopportunity to nominate any EPS2-enabled pharmacy across England from which to \ncollect their medication. In the patient interest, and in the interest of maintaining \nflexibility and competition among pharmacist, nominations can be easily changed. \nAssuming the patient does not change her nomination too frequently nomination may \nallow pharmacists to accumulate data concerning patients\u2019 treatment and thus to \nprovide more customised advice, monitor patients\u2019 health and intervene whenever this \nis necessary. To a degree such data is already held by pharmacies, but the nomination \nprocess, may enable more complete information. As a representative of a dispensing \nsoftware supplier said: \n\u2018It\u2019s sort of like a loyalty card in the sense that, I\u2019ll always come back to you and \nI\u2019ll always come and get my prescriptions from you. You\u2019re tied to the patient. \nTherefore, you get to know who Mr Smith is.\u2019 \nPharmacists, however, worry that nomination impersonalises the relationship \nbetween pharmacists and patients because it makes choice less reliant on personal \nacquaintance and more dependent on convenience of location. Thus nomination is \nexpected to have a major impact on the geographical distribution of pharmacies and \nthe business potential of pharmacies in residential areas. The representatives of a \npharmacy chain argued that the empowerment of patients to nominate prioritises \nspeedy collection of medicines over the provision of pharmacists\u2019 clinical advice. \nThus some interviewees expressed concerns about the potential for \u2018script direction\u2019 \nsuggesting that nomination opens up the possibility for a style of competition to \nimprove the position of large pharmacies in the market and exclude smaller \npharmacies. As an one interviewee said: \n\u2018pharmacies \u2026 are scared of EPS, because they think that they are going to lose \ncontrol and they are going to lose business. So what pharmacists are going to do, as \nsoon as they become EPS enabled is they are going to start collecting nominations \nfrom every patient that walks in their door.\u2019 \nIndeed, policy makers have attempted to address this risk by imposing new norms \nthat guide prescribers and dispensers\u2019 behaviour. The \u2018EPS Release 2 Business \nGuidance for Initial Implementers\u2019 articulates how prescribers and dispensers should \nbehave in relation to nomination:  \n[Dispensing staff] \u2018\u2026shall not give or offer any gift or reward to encourage a \npatient to nominate them; this also includes the offering of share dividends of points, \ndiscounts and loyalty points\u2026 NHS Pharmaceutical Service Regulations 2005, \nprohibit pharmacists or their staff from offering inducements to encourage patients to \nnominate them\u2019 (p. 41) \n 4.4   Changing Pharmacy Business  \nEPS2 constitutes a \u2018business critical\u2019 issue for most pharmacies, clearly linked to their \nfuture viability. Further, due to its potential to electronically connect pharmacists with \nthe NHS, it renders them more of an identifiable part of it. As an official from CfH \nsaid:     \n\u2018You put in the technology, so you are making them part of the NHS family \ntechnically. They are all connected to N3 either directly or indirectly. They are all \nhaving smart cards, so that they can be uniquely identified\u2019  \nConnection to the Spine requires a large financial investment in purchasing new \nsoftware and a commitment for its future maintenance. This, according to a \nrepresentative of a dispensing software supplier, will squeeze pharmacies\u2019 profit \nmargins in the future. But this can be seen as part of a wider shift in the ecology;  \naccess to the Spine may potentially give pharmacists access to a summary of patients\u2019 \nelectronic health record (the Summary Care Record described above) if and when this \nbecomes widely available. The director of an independent pharmacy saw this as very \nimportant both because it can inform pharmacists about patient conditions under \nwhich medicines are prescribed and allows them to judge the appropriateness of the \nprescription, as happens in hospital pharmacy. Visibility of patients\u2019 records may \nempower pharmacists and give them more control over their work and allow them to \nbe more patient-oriented. Apart from just viewing this information, the opportunity \nfor feeding information into a patient record was also highlighted by some \nparticipants as an important potential advantage for pharmacists of broader EPS \nenabled systems. A representative from a software supplier argued that, unlike \ndoctors, community pharmacists know the type of deregulated and over the counter \nmedicines that patients take beyond what is prescribed. Feeding this information back \ncould give a more thorough view of the patient to the doctor and lead to better \nconsultations. \nAccess to patients\u2019 records may thus influence community pharmacists\u2019 \nprofessional stance by making it more clinically-oriented. The dispensing process, we \nmay hypothesise, would become more a back-office operation undertaken by non-\nprofessional pharmacy staff, such as Accredited Checking Technicians, as \npharmacists make better use of their skills focusing on the provision of clinical care3. \nIndeed, the inclusion of more clinical services into pharmacists\u2019 work seems to be one \nvision for pharmacies in the future4,7. As a CfH official said, reflecting on repeat \ndispensing, pharmacists are envisioned to be: \n\u2018\u2026a first port of call for minor illnesses\u2026and also as an additional service\u2026for \nlong term condition management\u2019. \nEPS can be seen in more disruptive terms. It could potentially give rise to new \nbusiness models, such as web-based pharmacies, and allow existing and new \nstakeholders, such as Amazon, existing wholesalers or central supermarket online \nstores, enter into the pharmacy business in the future. These new models, which are \nless likely to get into the provision of clinical services, may in the future challenge \npharmacists\u2019 current professional view. \n                                                \n7 Pharmacy in the Future \u2013 Implementing the NHS Plan: A Programme for pharmacy in the \nNational Health Service, September 2000 \n Finally, the Spine has the potential to provide the Department of Health with real \ntime information concerning prescribing and dispensing activity. This information, \nwhich was up until now obscured and estimated, may enable in the future a more \neffective governing of community pharmacies. This is despite the fact that EPS as a \nCfH official argued has not been intentionally designed for such a purpose: \n\u2018\u2026there is funny goings on in pharmacies and in prescribing that we don\u2019t know \nabout. We do know about, but we\u2019ve got no evidence. It\u2019s not the job of EPS to deal \nwith that, but \u2026 there will be better quality information, quality data which people, at \nsome point can take action and look at in detail, should they wish.\u2019 \n5   Analysis and Discussion  \nThis section responds to our research question concerning the possibilities that \ntechnology opens up to transform community pharmacists\u2019 profession. Table 1 briefly \nillustrates the core analytical remarks we make below. \nThe case of the EPS can be seen as  a manifestation of the way in which \nprofessionals can be influenced by technological advancements [30],[35]. In \nsummary, EPS can influence pharmacists\u2019 work in three ways. To begin with, the \nparallel centralisation and decentralisation [23] of electronic prescriptions intends to \neliminate paper and in doing so to dissociate the dispensing process from its material \naspects. The strength of paper prescriptions is that they are mobile and combinable \n[26]; pharmacists hold a paper prescription throughout the dispensing process and \ncheck against it the medications they dispense. The mediation of technology, \nhowever, transforms them into \u2018screen-level\u2019 pharmacists, to borrow Bovens and \nZouridis (2002) [43] term, who continuously need to consult a computer interface in \norder to conduct their daily activities.  \nTable 1.

EPS however \ntransgresses temporal boundaries by allowing pharmacists to decide when they \ndispense and perhaps where [44],[45]. Further, EPS also affords far more automation \nof the dispensing process by feeding complete data into pharmacists\u2019 systems \neliminating manual data entry [22]. \nUnlike what literature suggests  that automation leads to \u2018de-skilling\u2019 [30] EPS has \nthe potential to generate data that \u2018informates\u2019 pharmacists work [24]. Interviewees \nhave suggested that through the functionality of \u2018nomination\u2019 pharmacists may be \nable to acquire large amounts of data concerning patients\u2019 treatment and develop a \nbetter understanding of them [21]. At the same time, the focus of nomination on \npatients\u2019 convenience may, in the long run, transform pharmacists from professionals \ninto mere providers of pre-packed medications. This is likely to weaken their \ndistinctive \u2018pharmaceutical gaze\u2019 [32], threaten their professional status and condition \n\u2018de-professionalisation\u2019 [30].   \nOur initial findings do suggest that EPS may expand pharmacists\u2019 jurisdictions by \nadding further responsibilities [30]. Electronic prescription messages may be \nmodified while being exchanged between doctors and pharmacists. This can happen \nfor instance due to possible mismatches in mapping data dictionaries. Pharmacists are \nthen rendered responsible for interpreting the messages they receive and exercising \ntheir professional discretion, as they did in the past with the handwritten and often \nillegible prescriptions. With a high level of use of repeat dispensing, one of the main \nbenefits claimed for EPS, pharmacists will become the  primary health professional \nmonitoring chronic diseases for periods of up to 12 months. This will often require \nmaking decisions when pharmacists have limited knowledge about the detail of a \npatient\u2019s case. Despite the risks that such a scenario may entail it is likely to raise the \nstatus of pharmacists\u2019 profession by prompting for their further re-skilling [30]. \nFurther, a number of  participants in this research argued, that EPS may provide \npharmacists access to an electronic summary of a patient record. This would condition \ntwo possibilities. First, pharmacists are informed not only about what has been \nprescribed but also the reasons for its prescription. By knowing patients\u2019 diagnosis \nand treatments they also know when they should (and should not) provide specific \nover the counter medications based on possible adverse effects. They are thus able to \nmake professional judgments and provide more clinically oriented services. One \ncould therefore interpret pharmacists\u2019 possible access to a summary patient record as \nanother government attempt to re-professionalise pharmacists by fostering the use of \ntheir clinical skills and professional judgment [19][35]. Second, and perhaps more \nimportant, pharmacists may be able to feedback to a patient\u2019s record information \n about patients. For instance, concerning over the counter medications that patients \nbuy (information which prescribing authorities can hardly know) pharmacists may \ngenerate information that assists clinical decision making across the prescribing and \ndispensing process [25],[26],[24]. \nAnother consequence of EPS for the pharmacy profession concerns inter-\nprofessional trust. As our research indicated EPS has the potential to weaken personal \ntrust by mediating between doctors and pharmacists and thus making them less inter-\ndependent. Specifically, personal and often intuitive ways of communicating are \novertaken by electronic exchanges of messages between geographically distant \nrecipients often unknown to each other. In this EPS brings impersonality, devalues \ninterpersonal ties and fosters \u2018system trust\u2019 [44]. Yet we know that the extent to which \ntechnology can substitute for human professional judgement remains open. \nPerhaps some inter-professional trust could be ensured through the (unintended) \npossibility that EPS provides for electronic monitoring. Specifically, provided that \npharmacists and patients are compliant with what is prescribed, doctors may be able \nto monitor whether (or not) and when their prescriptions have been dispensed \nindependently of personal acquaintance with either patient or pharmacist. By making \npharmacists\u2019 outputs visible and legible [28], inter-professional trust is strengthened, \nwhich confirms Knights et al (2001) [46] argument  that electronic monitoring \ntechnologies can substitute for the lack of trust in virtual environments.  \nSimilarly, there is the under-explored possibilities that EPS may provide to the \ngovernment for electronic monitoring of pharmacists\u2019 outputs [27]. The provision of \nreal time data will shed light on previously obscure aspects of the pharmacy business \nsuch as mismatches between prescribed and dispensed items. This may in turn enable \nauditing and decisions concerning future health budgets. EPS could pave the way to \nmore government intervention in pharmacists\u2019 work and to more effective control \nover professionals [30],[10]. Being connected to the Spine is a part of this, likely to \nbring about two consequences for pharmacists\u2019 professionalisation. By allowing \npharmacists\u2019 access to NHS-related information, such as patients\u2019 demographic \ninformation and diagnoses and treatments, and by making them identifiable to and \ntractable by the NHS, it also renders them, to use a participant\u2019s words, a part of the \n\u2018NHS family\u2019.  This indicates one role that technology - as a boundary creating \nmechanism - might play in professionalizing pharmacists through deeper inclusion \ninto the NHS [11]. At the same time this data also highlight the potential of \ntechnology to shift the boundaries of pharmacists\u2019 profession in other ways, e.g. by \nenabling new business models to emerge such as internet-based pharmacies using the \ninternet, telephone and post.  \nParticipants in our study particularly underlined the risks that new business models \nmay bring for community pharmacists. They mentioned the potential for illicit \ncompetition and patient direction and the diffusion of a business logic that would \ncorrode pharmacists\u2019 professionalism by re-directing it towards a profit driven \ndelivery model. This aligns with a number of studies that emphasise the \nentrepreneurial character of many public service professionals [7],[47] and suggests \nthat EPS could be perceived as an intensification of entrepreneurialism in healthcare \u2013 \na feature of the recently elected Government health policy. Such risks are historically \ncounter-balanced by governmental interventions that protect and maintain \npharmacists\u2019 professional status [10], but should we count on it?     \n 6   Conclusion \nThe paper discusses the possibilities that technology opens up to transform \npharmacists\u2019 profession in the future. We have argued that technology has the \npotential to centralise and decentralise, automate and informate practices and \nprocesses, generate new information, mediate communication and render outputs \nvisible. The six aspects of pharmacists\u2019 work we consider, work practices, values, \nroles, jurisdictions, power and boundaries are all open to adjustment. One possible \ninterpretation is that pharmacists\u2019 work will become an immaterial, spatially and \ntemporally dispersed computerised process, and that pharmacists will be transformed \ninto \u2018screen level\u2019 professionals as providers of accurately specified medicines (or put \nmore bluntly \u2013 they become call centre workers). But EPS could potentially bring \nabout more fundamental changes, that run counter. For example,  pharmacists\u2019 values \nmy change to become more patient oriented as they develop more clinical roles. And \nsystem trust may be a powerful substitute for  interpersonal trust as EPS strengthens \ntheir profession by expanding their responsibilities, and thus their jurisdictions. \nFurther, EPS could provide nuanced forms of electronic control that can enable better \nmonitoring and management of dispensing outputs and thus help build inter-\nprofessional trust.  \nThese changes, presented in table 1, constitute the framework we have developed  \nto project and analyse IT-mediated shifts in the professional roles and standing of \npharmacists. We do not make a prediction about the processes of professionalization \nin the future. This is not just because EPS has not been nationally rolled-out but \nprimarily because changes in professions and the way that professionalization is \nenacted are long-term, multi-dimensional and open to interpretation. They can hardly \nbe known in advance.  \n \nAcknowledgments \nThe authors would like to thank the interviewees that participated in this study, James Davies, \nPh.D. candidate at the School of Pharmacy, University of London, and the research team for \ntheir comments in an early draft of the paper. \nThe Evaluation of the Electronic Prescription Service in Primary Care is a collaboration \nbetween The School of Pharmacy, University of London, The London School of Economics \nand Political Science, and The University of Nottingham, under the leadership of Professors \nN.
