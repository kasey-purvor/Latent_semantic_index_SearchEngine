Cross-sectional\nscanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the coating morphology changes\nfrom a glassy to a columnar structure with increasing N2 partial pressure, which\ncoincides with the transition from an amorphous to a crystalline growth mode. The\nsaturation of N content in the coating confirms the formation of a thermodynamically\nstable CrN\u2013BN dual-phase structure at higher N2 fractions, exhibiting a maximum in\nhardness of approximately 29 GPa.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTransition metal nitride coatings, such as CrN and\nTiN, have been widely used as protective hard coatings\nto increase the lifetime and performance of cutting and\nforming tools.1 It is well known that CrN has superior hot\ncorrosion resistance and lower friction coefficients com-\npared to TiN.2 Physical vapor deposition (PVD) CrN\ncoatings have been investigated extensively and have at-\ntracted attention due to their excellent properties.3 In\ncontrast to these binary coatings, only a few studies have\nbeen reported on coatings within the ternary Cr\u2013B\u2013N\na)Address all correspondence to this author.\ne-mail: kyriakip@ucy.ac.cy\nDOI: 10.1557\/JMR.2008.0370\nJ. Mater. Res., Vol. 23, No. 11, Nov 2008 \u00a9 2008 Materials Research Society3048\nsystem.4\u20138 Additions of B have been reported to result in\na substantial improvement of the mechanical properties\nand thermal stability of CrN coatings.5,8 For similar sys-\ntems, such as Ti\u2013B\u2013N, B-enriched areas, covering TiN\ncrystals and promoting the nucleation of TiB2 (which\nitself has a low solubility for N) were reported.9 Similar\nsegregation-driven processes occur for N in TiB2. These\nprocesses periodically interrupt the epitaxial growth of\nindividual crystallites and cause renucleation, leading to\nextremely small crystallite size of 2 to 3 nm for TiN\u2013\nTiB2 coatings. These effects have been attributed to the\nnucleation of boron as well as to boron diffusion and\naccumulation at grain boundaries.9 The addition of boron\nalso promotes increased cohesion at the grain boundaries\nby affecting the local bonding at the interface (assuming\nthat there is no oxygen, chlorine, or hydrogen uptake\nduring deposition that would weaken the interfacial\nstrength).10,11\nAlthough little is known about Cr\u2013B\u2013N thin films,4\u20138\nbulk Cr\u2013B\u2013N is a multiphase material with a complex\nphase diagram,12 consisting of CrN, Cr2N, BN, and vari-\nous CrxBy phases (see Fig. 1), each of which exhibit\ndifferent mechanical properties. The BN phase can crys-\ntallize in one of two forms, cubic (c-BN) or hexagonal\n(h-BN). These two polymorphic phases have different\nphysical properties; c-BN is a very hard material with\nhardness approaching that of diamond, while h-BN is a\nsoft material that generates a low friction coefficient in\nmost dry sliding conditions due to its easily activated\nhexagonal shear systems with possible application tem-\nperatures up to 770 \u00b0C.13 However, in multiphase nano-\nstructured coatings, BN is generally found to be present\nas an amorphous phase.7,13,14\nFor other M\u2013B\u2013N (M stands for transition metal) ter-\nnary (or quaternary) systems, such as Ti\u2013B\u2013N,11 Ti\u2013Al\u2013\nB\u2013N,13,14 and Zr\u2013B\u2013N,15\u201319 it is generally agreed that\nimprovement of the mechanical properties results from a\nnanocomposite structure where virtually dislocation-free\nnanometer sized crystallites are separated by one to two\nmonolayers of a strongly bonded amorphous phase at the\ngrain boundaries. The crystallite size and the amorphous\nphase fraction can be finely adjusted by varying the tar-\nget composition.20 In the case of the Ti\u2013B\u2013N system, it\nhas been reported that the formation of a nonequilibrium\nsupersaturated solid solution of B in TiN might contrib-\nute to a further strengthening of the material, since the\ngliding of dislocations formed within the crystallites will\nbe hindered by the additional B-induced strain fields.14,20\nDue to the similarities in structure and properties be-\ntween Ti\u2013N and Cr\u2013N phases, Cr\u2013B\u2013N coatings can be\nexpected to exhibit properties similar to Ti\u2013B\u2013N.\nThe aim of the present study is the use of the higher\nenergetic growth conditions provided by reactive arc\nevaporation for the synthesis of Cr\u2013B\u2013N coatings. The\ncoatings microstructure and bonding structure is ana-\nlyzed as a function of N2 fraction and correlated to their\nrespective hardness as determined by nanoindentation.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nA. Synthesis\nCr\u2013B\u2013N coatings were deposited using a commercial\nOerlikon Balzers RCS coating system with a chamber\nvolume of 1000 l and a base pressure in the range of\n10\u22126 mbar (0.1 Pa). Si (100), high speed steel (HSS DIN\n1.3343), cemented carbide (grade 10) cutting inserts, and\nFe foil substrates were used as substrates. The substrates\nwere heated to 500 \u00b0C and Ar ion etched for approxi-\nmately 20 min using a secondary gas discharge. Four\nsources were equipped with sintered Cr\/B (80\/20 at.%)\ncathodes and fixed at a constant arc current of 150 A\nduring deposition. The N2 fraction (N2\/Ar + N2) was set\nto 0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.5, and 1, respectively, and\nbackfilled with Ar to a constant total pressure of 2 Pa as\nregulated by a capacitive gauge. A moderate bias voltage\nof \u221220 V was applied during deposition to assist growth,\nwithout triggering detrimental high levels of intrinsic\nstress. A Cr\u2013N coating was deposited for comparison\npurposes using metallic Cr targets (instead of Cr\/B com-\npound targets) and the same parameters.\nB. Analysis\nCoating thickness was measured on high-speed steel\nand cemented carbide cutting inserts by ball cratering\nand verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)\ncross-sectional analysis (Zeiss Evo 50, Oberkochen, Ger-\nmany) on fractured Si (100) samples. The compositional\ndepth profiles of the coatings were determined by time-\nof-flight (TOF) elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA)\nusing a primary beam of 350 MeV Au ions.21 The for-\nward-scattered coating atoms were analyzed using a\nFIG. 1. Composition of the coatings as determined by ERDA in re-\nspect to the simplified ternary Cr\u2013B\u2013N phase diagram.\nK.

Res., Vol. 23, No. 11, Nov 2008 3049\ndetection system with a solid angle of 0.4 msr (milli-\nsteradians) and a large detection angle of 60\u00b0,22 which\nenables simultaneous detection of all elements (including\nH). The crystal structure of the coatings was examined\nusing a Siemens D 500 x-ray diffractometer (XRD; Cu\nK\u0001\u0001 1.5418 \u00c5; Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). As XRD\nonly provides information about crystalline phases, x-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investi-\ngate amorphous phases and provide general information\non chemical bonding. XPS was undertaken on a Thermo\nVG Scientific Sigma Probe spectrometer (Sussex, UK)\nusing monochromatic Al K\u0001 radiation (1486.6 eV). For\nindividual elemental peak scans, a pass energy of 20 eV\nwas used, giving an energy resolution of <0.5 eV. To\nremove the surface contamination, the sample surface\nwas sputter cleaned by a 3 keV rastered argon ion beam\nwith a current of 0.3 \u0002A for some minutes. However,\nsome oxide still remained at the surface for the coating\nwith no N and those with low N contents after this clean-\ning process. The binding energies (BE) were referenced\nto the C 1s peak (285.0 eV), corresponding to hydrocar-\nbon contamination. In addition, high-resolution transmis-\nsion electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used to further\ninvestigate the coating nanostructure. Coatings deposited\nonto Si substrates were prepared for cross-sectional and\nplane view imaging by cleaving and mechanical polish-\ning (thinning) of the samples up to a thickness of about\n10 \u0002m, followed by Ar ion etching (milling) down to\nelectron transparency.21 The samples were analyzed\nfirstly in a Philips CM20 TEM (Eindhoven, The Neth-\nerlands) and then a JEOL 2010F field emission gun (FEG)\nTEM, both operated at 200 keV.\nThe indentation response of the films was analyzed\nusing a UMIS nanoindenter. The shape of the three-sided\npyramidal diamond tip (radius of approximately 100 nm)\nof Berkovich geometry was calibrated using the method\nsuggested by Oliver and Pharr with fused silica as refer-\nence material.23,24 After polishing to a 1 \u0002m finish (to a\nsurface roughness value of Ra\u0001 0.05 \u0002m), the coatings\ndeposited to a thickness larger than 3 \u0002m on high-speed\nsteel were indented with a constant maximum load of\n20 mN. The indentation hardness H and reduced modulus\nE were then calculated using the Oliver and Pharr\nmethod24 (in accordance with the European standard25)\nfrom at least 20 indents. The temperature-dependent\nstress state was evaluated by curvature measurements of\ncoated Si(100) substrates (7 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 0.3 mm3), measured\nby laser deflection following Stoney\u2019s equation under\nvacuum for temperatures up to 700 \u00b0C.26\nIII. RESULTS\nAfter removal from the deposition chamber, the 3.5 to\n4.6 \u0002m thick coatings (Table I) exhibited a silver gray\ncoloration independent of the N2 fraction. At the same\ntime, the deposition rate was found to increase from\n35 nm\/min at low N2 fractions to 50 nm\/min in a pure N2\ndischarge. The deposition rate was calculated using the\ncoating thickness (obtained from SEM cross-sectional\nstudies) and the coating deposition time.\nA. Composition\nThe composition of the samples as determined by\nERDA is displayed in Table I. It is noteworthy that de-\nspite the moderate base pressure (\u223c10\u22126 mbar, 0.1 Pa),\nthe level of impurities in the Cr\u2013B\u2013N coatings such as O,\nH, and C does not exceed a total of 0.5 at.%. With respect\nto the main constituents, the coatings can be divided into\nthree groups. The first is the coating synthesized in pure\nAr, which in the ideal case should mirror the Cr\/B target\ncomposition of (4\/1). However, the Cr\/B ratio for all the\ncoatings was found to be approximately two times higher\nthan the target ratio (Table I). This result indicates that a\nsynthesis-related consistent boron loss was observed for\nall N2 partial pressures, which moderates slightly for the\ncoating synthesized at higher N2 fraction (\u00030.5), sug-\ngesting that the B loss might be gas scattering related.\nThe second group, synthesized at lower N2 fractions (0.1\nand 0.15), represents in terms of nitrogen a transition,\nwhere approximately 23 to 29 at.% N is incorporated.\nThis results in a Cr\/(B + N) ratio of approximately 2\n(Table I). The respective positions of these coatings\nwithin the ternary phase diagram (shown in Fig. 1) sug-\ngest that the chromium-rich films might contain a large\nfraction of Cr2N.

The N concentration saturates at N2 fractions\nexceeding 0.5, corresponding to a (Cr + B)\/N stoichi-\nometry of 1 (Table I). This suggests a dual-phase struc-\nture along the quasi-binary tie line between CrN and BN\n(Fig. 1).\nB. Coating structure\n1. XRD\nThe crystal structure of the coatings was investigated\nby XRD and the corresponding patterns are given in Fig.\n2. The standard 2\u0005 positions for face-centered cubic (fcc)\nCrN (JCPDS No. 76-2494), hexagonal Cr2N (JCPDS No.\n79-2159), and metallic Cr (JCPDS No. 06-0694) are in-\ncluded in the figure. For the coating synthesized in pure\nAr only peaks attributable to Cr are observed. Since this\ncoating contains 10.7 at.% B, any eventually formed\nchromium boride phase present must be amorphous. This\nXRD pattern suggests strongly textured film growth,\nsince no other peaks are observed. With increasing N\ncontent (0.1 and 0.15 N2 fractions, giving rise to N con-\ntents of 23 and 29 at.%, respectively), there is a single\nreflection at \u223c44.8\u00b0 with a broad tail to higher angles. It\nis difficult to give an unambiguous interpretation, but it\nseems most likely that there are two nanocrystalline\nphases present, Cr(N) and either Cr2N or CrN. It has\npreviously been shown by Rebholz et al.27: that up 16 to\nat.% N can be interstitially incorporated in \u0001-Cr for re-\nactively sputtered Cr\u2013N coatings. A shift of the Cr2N or\nCrN peak to higher angles would be consistent with the\npresence of a substoichiometric CrN or Cr2N phase. Con-\nsidering the positions of these coatings in the phase dia-\ngram, the formation of Cr2N may be expected. As the\nnitrogen fraction is increased (\u00030.2), the single feature at\n\u223c44\u00b0 narrows and shifts toward lower angles, suggesting\nthe formation of CrN with an approximately stoichiomet-\nric composition (in accordance with its position in the\nphase diagram). Furthermore, additional reflections\nemerge, confirming the formation of CrN. A slight peak\nshift to lower angles together with a progressive change\nfrom a (200) to a (111) texture is noticeable for coatings\ndeposited at higher N2 fractions. For coatings deposited\nat N2 fractions of 0.25, 0.5, and 1, the crystallite size of\nCrN, estimated using the Scherrer equation,28 was found\nto be 5.9, 6.7, and 10.4 nm, respectively. On the other\nhand, the coatings deposited at low N2 fraction probably\nshow smaller grain sizes (but peak overlap makes a clear\ndetermination of grain size untenable).\n2. TEM\nTEM images of the 0 N2 coating (deposited in Ar\nusing the 80\/20 Cr\/B target) are shown in Fig. 3. This\ncoating shows the presence of columnar growth, with the\ncolumn diameters ranging between 50 and 400 nm. Fig-\nure 3(b) is a dark-field image of one of the columns at\nhigher magnification, and a multilayer structure with a\nperiod of 24 nm can be observed. This multilayer effect\nhas previously been reported for Ti\u2013B\u2013N coatings depos-\nited using the same equipment (employing similar mixed\nTi\/B targets to those used in this work).29,30 The origin of\nthis multilayer structure is the different annular Cr and B\nemission from the target. Thus, the multilayer effect is\ncaused by a small periodic change in the Cr\/B ratio.30 For\nthe coating deposited at 0.1 N2 fraction the dark field\nimages [Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)] show a uniform grain size.\nFor the Cr\u2013B\u2013N coatings, TEM shows a pronounced\nsuppression of columnar growth with increasing N2 frac-\ntion. At 0.5 N2 fraction, the columnar structure seems to\nbe weak and the featherlike structure is indicative of\ncontinual renucleation [Figs. 3(e) and 3(f)]. This is in\nagreement with the SAED pattern for this coating [Fig.\n3(f)], which shows little evidence of texture [the (200)\npreferential orientation seen for the coatings deposited at\nlower N2 fractions now being suppressed]. The SAED is\nin agreement with CrN with space group Fm3\u00afm and a\nunit-cell dimension a \u0001 4.148 \u00c5.\n3. XPS\nFigure 4 shows the Cr 2p, B, and N 1s core-level\nspectra of the coatings. Despite the sputter cleaning prior\nto analysis, many spectra still exhibited residual oxygen-\nrelated bonding, e.g., B\u2013O bonds at 191.5 eV.31\nThe Cr 2p spectra exhibit two broad features charac-\nteristic for the Cr 2p 1\u20442 and 2p 3\u20442 orbitals.

The contribution at higher EB could be\nassigned to Cr\u2013B bonds,32 while the contamination-\nrelated contributions of Cr\u2013N and Cr\u2013O might also be\npresent. This is in accordance with the expected mixture\nof metallic Cr with CrBx. As soon as N2 is introduced to\nthe discharge, the metallic Cr\u2013Cr contribution vanishes\nand the spectra narrows at an EB characteristic for Cr\u2013N\nbonds indicating the CrN-dominated environment at\nhigher N2 fractions.33,34\nFIG. 3.

Res., Vol. 23, No. 11, Nov 20083052\nThe B 1s peak indicates that a Cr2B phase is being\nformed in the coatings with N contents up to 42 at.%.\nConsidering the absence of any Cr2B peaks in the XRD\nspectra, it has to be assumed that this phase is amor-\nphous. With increasing N concentration, the Cr2B phase\nis progressively replaced by an amorphous BN phase\ndriven mainly by thermodynamics.\nThe N 1s spectra are more difficult to interpret. In the\nliterature, Cr2N and CrN are reported to occur at binding\nenergies of 396.7 and 397.4 eV, respectively, and BN is\nfound at 398.1 eV.31\u201335 It has already been established\nfrom the B 1s spectra that BN is present in the coatings\nwith higher N concentrations. It is also clear from the low\ntotal B content in these coatings (and their position in the\nphase diagram) that in all coatings BN represents a small\namount of the total phase fraction. This is reflected in the\nlow intensity of the N 1s peak at the BN peak position.\nConsidering the N peak maximum, it can be seen that\nwith increasing N content the peak maximum shifts from\nhigher to lower binding energies. This would suggest that\nfor N2 fractions of 0.1 and 0.15 (corresponding to N\ncontents of 23 and 29 at.%, respectively), the chromium\nnitride phase present in the coatings is Cr2N, but CrN is\nformed at higher N contents.\nC. Mechanical properties\nThe indentation hardness (HIT) and reduced elastic\nmodulus (Er) for the coatings deposited at different N2\npartial pressures are presented in Fig. 5. The maximum\nhardness of \u223c29.5 \u00b1 0.9 GPa (corresponding modu-\nlus value of \u223c322 \u00b1 7 GPa) is observed for coatings\ndeposited at higher N2 fractions \u00030.5. For lower N2 frac-\ntions, lower\u2014but still acceptable\u2014hardness values (23\u2013\n24 GPa) were observed. Within the same region the\nmodulus is increasing from 324 to 362 GPa, with a maxi-\nmum for the N-free coating. The modulus of 342 \u00b1 11\nGPa of the CrN reference sample deposited under similar\nconditions is comparable. However, the hardness of\n18.5 \u00b1 0.6 GPa is inferior to the B-containing coatings.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. Influence of N2 fraction on structure evolution\nThe N2 partial pressure has a significant effect on the\nbonding and microstructure of the arc-evaporated Cr\u2013\nB\u2013N coatings. Combining the ERDA, XRD, and XPS\nresults, the coating deposited in pure Ar consists of me-\ntallic nanocrystalline (nc-) Cr and amorphous (a-) Cr2B.\nAs N2 is introduced in the discharge (0.1 and 0.15 N2\nfraction), an unambiguous assignment is difficult, but it\nwould appear that a three-phase structure of nc-Cr(N),\na-Cr2B and substoichiometric nc-Cr2N (or less likely nc-\nCrN) phase is formed. At a 0.2 N2 fraction, a three-phase\nnc-CrN, a-BN, and a-Cr2B coating is deposited. Then for\nhigher N2 fractions, a dual-phase nc-CrN and a-BN struc-\nture is formed.\nB. Effect of microstructure on mechanical\nproperties of the coatings\nFigure 5 exhibits hardness and reduced elastic modu-\nlus of Cr\u2013B\u2013N coatings as a function of the N2 fraction.\nThe most significant findings can be summarized as fol-\nlows: (i) The reference Cr\u2013N coating exhibits a hardness\nvalue of 18.5 GPa. This hardness is in agreement with\nreported values for CrN.36 (ii) The coating deposited in\npure Ar (0% N2) exhibits a hardness value of 25 GPa.\nThis hardness is relatively high for a mainly metallic,\nCr-base coating. However, the hardening effects of the\nCr2B phase, grain-size reduction associated with a dual-\nphase plasma-deposited microstructure and compressive\nstress might explain this high hardness.37 For the coating\ndeposited at 0% N2, the stress was found to be \u22121.5 GPa.\nAll the arc-evaporated B-containing coatings deposited\n(with and without N) exhibit high hardness (22\u201329 GPa).\nThis behavior could be attributed to boron segregation to\nthe grain boundaries,9 which causes hindering of dislo-\ncation movement and the formation of amorphous Cr2B\nand BN phases. These two mechanisms of hardness im-\nprovement are both valid for the coatings deposited at\nlow and high N2 fractions, respectively. (iii) For coatings\ndeposited at N2 fractions up to 0.25, the hardness remains\nconstant and then increases for a N2 fraction of 0.5. Con-\nsequently, the formation of a nanocomposite structure of\nnc-CrN and a-BN gives rise to the highest hardness.\nAccording to the phase diagram, this corresponds to a\nstructure comprising approximately 89 mol% nc-CrN +\n11 mol% a-BN. For a nc-CrN with an average grain size\nof approximately 5 nm, to give monolayer coverage an\namorphous layer content of approximately 10 mol% is\nrequired.16 Hence, the highest hardness is obtained for a\nnc-CrN\/a-BN coating with monolayer a-BN coverage of\nthe CrN nanocrystallites.\nFIG. 5. Indentation hardness and reduced elastic modulus values for\nCr\u2013B\u2013N coatings, including a CrN reference deposited under similar\nconditions.\nK. Polychronopoulou et al.: Synthesis and characterization of Cr\u2013B\u2013N coatings deposited by reactive arc evaporation\nJ. Mater. Res., Vol. 23, No. 11, Nov 2008 3053\nAlso, from Fig. 5 it is clear that increasing the N2\nfraction (from 0 to 0.25) causes a rather significant de-\ncrease in the elastic modulus values for the coatings\ndeposited at low N2 fractions (from 359 \u00b1 6 to 312 \u00b1\n14 GPa). This would appear to correlate with a gradual\ndecrease in the a-Cr2B content. The coatings deposited at\nhigher N2 fractions have a dual-phase nc-CrN\/a-BN\nstructure, and this gives rise to the highest hardness com-\nbined with the lowest elastic modulus, yielding a H\/E\nvalue of 0.09. This is in good agreement with previous\nwork on nc-(Ti,Al)N\/a-BN coatings, where a dual-phase\nstructure comprised of 90 mol% (Ti,Al)N and 10 mol%\na-BN gave rise to the highest H\/E ratio.15\nBiaxial stress measurements showed minimum intrin-\nsic compressive stresses (\u22121.3 GPa and \u22120.8 GPa for 0.1\nand 0.2 N2 fraction, respectively) at the deposition tem-\nperature (Tdep \u0001 500 \u00b0C) for coatings deposited at low\nN2 partial pressure, whereas the opposite was found for\ncoatings deposited at N2 fraction >0.25 (\u22122 GPa for coat-\ning deposited at 0.5 N2 fraction). The stress is dependent\non many factors including ion bombardment, phase com-\nposition, and the thermal expansion coefficients of each\nphase present. This increased stress for higher N frac-\ntions is possibly the result of a two-phase (purely ce-\nramic) nc-CrN\/a-BN coating being deposited compared\nwith the three-phase coatings with larger amorphous\nfractions and lower thermal expansion coefficients\nformed at lower N fractions.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn the present study it was demonstrated that\nnanocomposite coatings within the ternary Cr\u2013B\u2013N sys-\ntem can be deposited by high-rate reactive arc evapora-\ntion. The microstructure, chemical bonding environment,\nand mechanical properties of the coatings can be con-\ntrolled (and designed) by adjusting the nitrogen fraction.\nBy increasing the N2 content, the columnar structure is\nsuppressed by renucleation processes, and for coatings\ndeposited at N2 fractions \u00030.5 a dense growth mode was\nobserved. Coatings deposited at low N2 fractions consist\nmainly of metallic Cr, Cr2B, and substoichiometric Cr2N\nphases. Increasing the N2 content leads to the formation\nof a two-phase stoichiometric nc-CrN and a-BN struc-\nture. The coating deposited at 0.5 N2 had a nc-CrN\/a-BN\nstructure comprising approximately 90 mol% nc-CrN\nand 10 mol% a-BN and an average grain size of approxi-\nmately 6.7 nm, corresponding to monolayer coverage of\nthe nanocrystalline CrN grains. This nanocomposite\ncoating had the highest hardness of 29 GPa and highest\nH\/E value of 0.09.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe financial support from the FP6 Marie Curie Ac-\ntions (Project EXT-0023899\u2014NanoHeaters) of the Eu-\nropean Commission and the Christian Doppler Society,\nAustria, is highly acknowledged.
