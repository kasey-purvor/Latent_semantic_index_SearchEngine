Michie et al. (2005) \nagreed 12 \u201ctheoretical domains\u201d from 33 theories that explain behaviour change. \nThey developed a \u201dtheoretical domains interview\u201d(TDI) for identifying relevant \ndomains for specific clinical behaviours, but the framework has not been used for \nselecting theories for predictive studies. It was used here to investigate clinicians\u2019 \ntransfusion behaviour in intensive care units.  Evidence suggests that red blood cells \ntransfusion could be reduced for some patients without reducing quality of care. \nObjectives:  \n1. To identify the domains relevant to transfusion practice in intensive care units \n(ICUs) and neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), using the TDI. \n2. To use the identified domains to select appropriate theories for a study predicting \ntransfusion behaviour. \nMethods: \nAn adapted TDI about managing a patient with borderline haemoglobin by watching \nand waiting instead of transfusing red blood cells was used to conduct semi-\nstructured, one-to-one interviews with 18 intensive care consultants and \nneonatologists across the UK. \nResults: \nRelevant theoretical domains were: knowledge, beliefs about capabilities, beliefs \nabout consequences, social influences, behavioural regulation. Further analysis at \nthe construct level resulted in selection of seven theoretical approaches relevant to \nthis context: Knowledge-Attitude-Behaviour model, Theory of Planned Behaviour, \nSocial Cognitive Theory, Operant Learning Theory, Control Theory, Normative Model \nof Work Team Effectiveness and Action planning approaches. \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 4 \nConclusions: \nThis study illustrated the use of the TDI to identify relevant domains in a complex \narea of inpatient care. This approach is potentially valuable for selecting theories \nrelevant to predictive studies and resulted in greater breadth of potential explanations \nthan would be achieved if a single theoretical model had been adopted. \n \nKeywords: \nTheory; clinical behaviour; semi-structured interviews; transfusion practice; evidence-\nbased health care \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 5 \nEvidence-based selection of theories for designing behaviour change interventions: \nUsing methods based on theoretical construct domains to understand clinicians\u2019 \nblood transfusion behaviour \n \n  \nHealth psychology offers a large number of theories to predict, explain or achieve \nhealth-related behaviour change.  This presents at least two problems for \nresearchers who wish to use theory to design behaviour change interventions.  First, \nit is impossible to use all the potentially relevant theories to investigate the behaviour \ntargeted for change.  Second, there is no systematic basis on which to select the \nmost relevant, important or useful theories for changing a particular behaviour.  \nResearchers are thus likely to adopt a small number of theories on which to base \ntheir investigations. For example, in studies of health professional behaviour, studies \ntypically investigate one or two theories (e.g., the Theory of Planned Behaviour \nand\/or the Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour; Godin, Belanger-Gravel, Eccles & \nGrimshaw 2008).  An exception is the PRIME study, which simultaneously tested six \ntheoretical frameworks (Bonetti, Pitts, Eccles, Grimshaw, Johnston, Steen, et al. \n2006; Eccles, Grimshaw, Johnston, Steen, Pitts, Thomas, et al. 2007). These \nframeworks were selected to examine explanations that focused on factors \ninfluencing motivation (Theory of Planned Behaviour, Social Cognitive Theory), or \naction, (Operant Learning Theory, Implementation Intention and the Common Sense \nSelf-Regulation Model) or stages of change. The justification for selecting these \ntheories was solid (Walker, Grimshaw, Johnston, Pitts, Steen & Eccles, 2003). First, \nall had been rigorously evaluated in other settings. Second, they all explain \nbehaviour in terms of factors that are amenable to change. Third, they all include \nnon-volitional components, i.e., they assume that individuals do not always have \ncomplete control over their actions. At a later date Michie, Johnston, Abraham, \nLawton, Parker, Walker, et al. (2005) proposed a wider range of theories relevant to \nclinicians\u2019 behaviour in implementing evidence. However, there is still not a clear \nmethod for selecting theories most likely to be relevant to a particular clinical action.  \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 6 \n \nOne possible method is to take a more inclusive approach to selecting theory. The \npresent study used the comprehensive set of theoretical construct domains \ndeveloped by Michie  et al. (2005) to identify the domains most relevant to a clinical \nbehaviour, and then mapped these domains on to theories of behaviour.  These \nmethods were used to select the theories most relevant to investigating and changing \nthe target behaviour.  The specific clinical behaviour under investigation was the \ntransfusion of red blood cells in patients in intensive care units (ICU) and neonatal \nintensive care units (NICU). \n \nMichie et al. (2005) used a systematic consensus methodology to agree 12 \n\u201ctheoretical construct domains\u201d from 33 theories (covering 128 theoretical constructs) \nthat may explain health-related behaviour change (Table 1, Column 1).  This group \ndeveloped a set of interview questions for identifying domains relevant to changing \nspecific evidence-based clinical behaviours (e.g., implementation of the NICE \nschizophrenia guidelines; Michie, Pilling, Garety, Whitty, Eccles, Johnston, et al. \n2007).  This set of questions is hereafter referred to as the \u201cTheoretical Domains \nInterview\u201d (TDI), where \u2018domain\u2019 is defined as \u201cencompassing a set of similar \ntheoretical constructs\u201d (Michie et al., 2005, p. 28). Data from the TDI may be used to \nidentify the theoretical domains that are most likely to be relevant to the behaviour \nunder investigation, so that they can be studied systematically, thereby strengthening \nthe evidence base for the selection of appropriate behaviour change techniques in \nthe design of behaviour change interventions (Michie, Johnston, Francis & Hardeman, \n2008).   \n \nThe consensus methods used in developing the 12 theoretical domains were \ndesigned to include broad coverage of theories and constructs relating to behaviour \nand behaviour change in the implementation of clinical guidelines.  This \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 7 \ncomprehensive set of domains thus provides a basis for acquiring empirical evidence \nto inform systematic selection of theories to investigate behaviour change in a \nparticular healthcare context.  \n \nThis approach has formed the basis of recent work on developing behaviour change \ninterventions to implement evidence-based healthcare (Foy, Francis, Johnston, \nEccles, Lecouturier, Bamford, Grimshaw, 2007; Hrisos, Eccles, Johnston, Francis, \nKaner, Steen, Grimshaw, 2008; McKenzie, French, O'Connor, Grimshaw, Mortimer, \nMichie, Francis, et al. 2008).  It makes an important contribution to current thinking \nabout the development of complex interventions to improve health.  The UK MRC \nguidance for developing complex interventions (Medical Research Council, 2008) \nargues that using a theoretical basis for identifying the factors that influence \nbehaviour and for selecting interventions can increase the chances of a complex \nintervention being appropriate for a specific behaviour and thereby increase its \nchances of success.  Using a theoretical basis also increases the cost effectiveness \nof developing and implementing an intervention since the mechanisms by which it \nsucceeds are better understood. \n \nHowever, although the TDI approach has been used to identify behaviour change \ntechniques, it has not yet been used as an evidence base for selecting whole \ntheories most likely to be relevant to the clinical behaviour under investigation. Thus, \nthe objectives of this study were to (1) adapt the interview questions to one area of \ncomplex in-patient hospital care: blood transfusion practice; (2) develop a method for \nselecting theories based on the theoretical domains identified as relevant. \n \nThis study used the theoretical domains as the basis for a series of interviews that \nwere conducted to identify appropriate theories. An integral part of the study included \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 8 \nclearly specifying the behaviour of interest.  The clinical behaviour was specified in \nthe light of evidence about transfusion practice which, whilst varied, supports \nreduction of blood transfusions in some situations (H\u00e9bert, Wells, Blajchman, \nMarshall, Martin, Pagliarello et al., 1999; H\u00e9bert, Fergusson, Stather, McIntyre, \nMartin, Doucette et al. 2005; Kirpalani, Whyte, Andersen, Asztalos, Heddle, \nBlajchman et al 2006; Lacroix, H\u00e9bert, Hutchison, Hume, Tucci, Ducruet et al., 2007).  \nThe clinical behaviour of interest was thus specified as \u201cmanaging a patient with \nborderline haemoglobin by watching and waiting instead of transfusing red cells\u201d. \n \nTwo groups of clinicians were selected for this interview study \u2013 intensive care \nconsultants and neonatologists.  These two groups of clinicians are significant users \nof blood products (Wallis, Wells, & Chapman, 2006; Walsh, Garrioch, Maciver, Lee, \nMacKirdy, McClelland, et al., 2004).  The study involved two methodological \ndevelopments compared with previous research.  First, the TDI was adapted to suit a \nclinical situation in which guidelines are based on limited high quality evidence. \nSecond, the domains identified as relevant to transfusion behaviour were used as an \nempirical basis for selecting theories most likely to inform studies to predict and \nchange this behaviour. \n \nMethods \nDesign \nThis was an interview study using semi-structured one-to-one interviews, based on \nthe theoretical domains, with intensive care consultants and neonatal consultants. \n \nParticipants \nEleven intensive care consultants (10 male, 1 female) and 7 neonatal consultants (5 \nmale, 2 female) from hospitals across England (53%) and Scotland (47%) were \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 9 \nrecruited to take part in the semi-structured interviews.  Consultants were aged 36-52 \nyears (mean = 44.42, SD = 4.71), and their experience as consultants ranged from 1 \nto 21 years (mean = 9.26, SD = 5.12).  The 18 participants were a purposive sample \nidentified by clinicians on the research team and were selected because they were \nconsidered to represent a broad range of views and attitudes towards transfusion \npractice, reflecting their different ages, hospitals and regions.  \n \nMaterials \nAn interview topic guide was developed (see Table 1), based on the 12 theoretical \ndomains, to elicit two kinds of beliefs: (i) general beliefs about the relevance of each \ndomain for the behaviour; and (ii) if relevant, specific beliefs to give greater detail \nabout the role of the domain in influencing the behaviour.  The TDI was adapted for \nthe specified behaviour and clinical contexts, as pilot testing (by CS) of a first draft of \nthe questions using the original TDI wording indicated that they did not always fit the \ncontext. For example, some clinicians indicated that they used not only guidelines but \nalso local protocols, or that they had changed their practice already based on \nevidence from one of the clinical trials rather than because of a guideline.  Clinician \ninformants and clinicians on the researcher team made suggestions for rewording \nsome questions and these suggestions were discussed by the team to ensure that \nthey retained the original meaning of each theoretical domain. The adapted TDI was \nfurther piloted and question wording was refined to enhance clarity.   \n  \nTABLE 1 HERE \nProcedure \nParticipants were contacted in writing and invited to an interview about their clinical \ndecision making in relation to transfusion practice.  All interviews were conducted (by \nCS) using the interview topic guide (Table 1), in an office at participants\u2019 places of \nwork to maintain privacy and confidentiality.  Interviews were recorded using a digital \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 10 \nrecording device (Olympus Voice & Music DM-20) and lasted between 24 and 56 \nminutes (M = 39; SD = 9). A second researcher (JF) listened to the recordings of the \nfirst two interviews to check fidelity of the use of the topic guide. The recordings were \ntranscribed and anonymised. \n  \nAnalysis  \nStage 1. One researcher (CS) content analysed the transcriptions by classifying the \nutterances into the theoretical domains.  The relevant domains were identified based \non the content of the beliefs elicited. A domain was considered \u2018relevant\u2019 if frequently \nmentioned responses indicated that it might affect performance of the clinical \nbehaviour. \nStage 2. First, the beliefs were used to identify constructs within each relevant \ntheoretical domain.  We provided three researchers (two psychologists and one \nclinical non-psychologist) with a list of the beliefs (from the Stage 1 analysis) and the \nlist of constructs from the original TDI paper (Michie et al., 2005, Table 1) and asked \nthem to work independently to match the beliefs with the constructs. Specific \nconstructs from the relevant domains were listed and discussed by the research \nteam to agree the theoretical models that represented these constructs. This \ndiscussion was based on the list of theories provided in the Appendix to the TDI \npaper. \n \nEthics \nThe study was approved by the West Glasgow Ethics Committee 1 and by each \nindividual Research and Development office of the 5 UK NHS Trusts\/Health Boards \nfrom which participants were drawn. \n \nResults \nStage 1: Identification of relevant construct domains \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 11 \nQuotations from the transcripts to illustrate each theoretical domain are reported in \nTables 2 and 3 below. The frequency with which each belief was mentioned is \npresented in the final column of each table.  Together, frequency and content (e.g., \nDo the responses suggest an issue or problem? Is there likely to be variance among \nclinicians?) were used to identify a domain as relevant or not.  \n \nTABLE 2 HERE \nTABLE 3 HERE \n \n(a) Domains reported not to influence a change in practice.  \nSkill was not an issue for this behaviour, which was consistently described as very \nstraightforward and normal. With respect to the domain, motivation and goals, most \nparticipants reported that the behaviour was important, suggesting that this domain is \nnot problematic. For memory, attention and decision processes, participants were \nvery fluent about the issues that they consider, suggesting that simply forgetting to do \nthe target behaviour is not a problem in this context.  When asked about \nenvironmental context and resources, participants consistently talked about the \nclinical context (e.g., the speed at which the haemoglobin is falling; the idea that the \npatient will have many other clinical problems) rather than the environmental context \nor problems with resources. This suggests that issues of resource and environment \nare not perceived as a barrier to watching and waiting instead of transfusing.  \nEmotion was discussed in terms of concern (about the patient) but not in terms of the \nconsultants\u2019 own emotions (stress or anxiety). When responding to questions about \nthe nature of the behaviour, participants tended to repeat or continue the responses \nthey offered for the domain, behavioural regulation. These answers thus did not add \nnew information. \n \n(b) Domains reported to influence a change in practice. \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 12 \nAs seen in Table 2, intensive care consultants in the sample were aware of the \nevidence base relating to transfusion practice. However, Table 3 shows that this was \na more problematic domain for the neonatology group. Most mentioned knowledge \nas a potential barrier to changing transfusion practice and noted that knowledge \nabout the evidence was variable. Neonatologists were often not convinced about the \nevidence base. The two groups of consultants reported similar views about the \nremaining domains. Views on beliefs about capabilities were variable, ranging from \nabsolutely confident to elaboration in the form of the difficulty would be if \u2026 and also \nconfident most of the time.  This variability suggested that the domain may be \nrelevant. When discussing beliefs about consequences (risks and benefits), \nparticipants talked a lot and gave specific examples, suggesting that this domain may \nrepresent one of the important ways that they think about this behaviour. Social \ninfluences appeared to be a relevant domain, partly as consultants may discuss \ndetails with relatives, but mostly as the decision tends to be discussed and agreed by \nclinical teams.   \n \nFor behavioural regulation, in terms of the strategies that consultants might adopt to \nachieve change, most consultants were able to generate alternative behaviours that \nmight assist change.  They also consistently referred again to the evidence base (i.e. \nthe domains knowledge and beliefs about consequences) in response to questions \nabout achieving change.  Some felt that their first step in adopting the change would \nbe a review of current practice. This suggests that the domain might be applicable to \nthe way change could be effected in this context, and thus behavioural regulation \nwas judged to be a relevant domain. \n \nIn summary, the theoretical domains that were identified and subsequently used to \nmap back to the theories were knowledge (of the evidence); beliefs about capabilities; \nbeliefs about consequences; social influences and behavioural regulation.   \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 13 \n \n (c) Domains for which reported influence is unclear. \nResponses to questions for the domain professional role and identity were not very \ninformative, as they did not identify whether following the evidence (in favour of more \nrestrictive transfusion practice) would be consistent or inconsistent with professional \nroles. Some reported that watching and waiting is normal for them. From this we \ninferred that professional role issues may not be a problem for the behaviour of \nwatching and waiting instead of transfusing.   \n \nStage 2:  \nTable 4 (Column 6) presents the results of the three coders in matching the elicited \nbeliefs with constructs within each domain. The agreement reached by four \nresearchers (JF, CS, MJ, MPE) about which theories best represent the constructs is \nalso reported in Table 4 (Column 6). \n \nTABLE 4 HERE \n \nTable 4 shows that there was substantial agreement between coders, given the large \nnumber of constructs in each domain. All three coders agreed constructs relating to 7 \nof the 21 beliefs. Two out of three agreed constructs relating to 10 beliefs. There was \nno agreement for four of the beliefs (or more accurately, two beliefs that were elicited \nfrom both ICU and NICU interviews): Disadvantages of watching & waiting: The \npatient\u2019s condition deteriorates; and I would need good, new evidence from research \nthat my transfusion practice needs to change. This disagreement occurred in two \ntheoretical domains comprising a large number of constructs (13 and 10 for beliefs \nabout consequences and behavioural regulation, respectively). \n \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 14 \nWhen full literal agreement was not obtained we checked whether all the identified \nconstructs fell within a single theory. For example, within beliefs about consequences, \nthe named constructs included attitude (reflecting global evaluation, equivalent to the \n\u2018direct\u2019 approach to attitude measurement in the Theory of Planned Behaviour) and \noutcome expectations (reflecting specific perceived consequences). Outcome \nexpectations can be considered as equivalent to Behavioural beliefs, which are \ncompatible with the \u2018indirect\u2019 approach to attitude measurement in the Theory of \nPlanned Behaviour. Similarly, feedback, action planning and goal setting (within \nbehavioural regulation) are all constructs from Control Theory (Carver & Scheier, \n1981). \n \nIdentification of relevant theories \nThe research team discussion to agree theories that are relevant to transfusion \npractice took into account the following components of Table 4. The identification of \nAttitude, Subjective norm and Perceived behavioural control suggested the Theory of \nPlanned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1991). The identification of Outcome expectancy and \nSelf-efficacy suggested Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1998). In addition, \nknowledge is part of the intuitive \u2018knowledge-attitude-behaviour\u2019 model (e.g., \nJohnston, Leung, Fielding, Tin, & Ho, 2003). Together, Outcome expectancies and \nFeedback imply that behaviour may also be influenced by rewards, suggesting that \nOperant Learning Theory (Skinner, 1953) may be applicable. However, as this theory \nproposes that processes of behaviour change bypass the cognitive route, further \ninvestigation would be needed to assess the relevance of this theory in the current \ncontext of self-reported views. Team working was identified as important (e.g., the \nNormative Model of Work Team Effectiveness; Hackman, 1983). Finally, within the \ndomain, behavioural regulation, the named constructs were all part of Control Theory \n(Carver & Scheier, 1981).  It was also decided that these constructs implied an action \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 15 \nplanning approach (Gollwitzer, 1999; Sniehotta, Scholz, Schwarzer, 2006) for \nplanning alternative behaviours could be relevant to changing transfusion behaviour.  \n \nDiscussion \nThe rich variety of theories, which may form a basis for investigations about health \nbehaviour and behaviour change, results in a challenge to the science of behaviour \nchange.  We need more systematic methods for selecting the most appropriate \ntheories to develop interventions for changing specific behaviours. This will ensure \nthat we consider those of greatest relevance to the behaviour and the context.  The \nTDI provides a basis for such methods.   \n  \nThe current study further developed these methods by operationalising the domains \nin a complex area of inpatient care where high quality evidence is still emerging, and \nby using the interview data to identify not only the domains relevant to the behaviour \nbut also specific constructs and theories implied by the data.  These methods were \nused in the context of evidence about a need for change in transfusion practice in \nintensive care and in neonatology. Given that, over the 12 domains, there are 128 \nconstructs, agreement reached between coders was reasonable. Even where there \nwas disagreement, the coding provided further guidance in selecting theories. As the \ndomains are made up of overlapping constructs (indeed, this was the rationale \nbehind the theoretical domains project), full agreement was unlikely at the literal level. \nDuring the coding exercise it became evident that a more fully referenced list \u2013 or an \nagreed set of definitions of constructs \u2013 would be valuable in conducting this kind of \nwork and may assist in enhancing agreement between coders. \n \nThe adapted TDI identified five of the 12 theoretical construct domains as potentially \nrelevant to transfusion practice.  However, there are problems in replacing \nestablished theories with the theoretical domains approach.  First, the framework \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 16 \ndoes not specify the relationships between the theoretical construct domains, as \nwould occur in a theory.  For example, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1991) \nspecifies that intention is directly related to behaviour whereas the relationships \nbetween behaviour and all other constructs in the model are mediated partly or fully \nthrough intention.  By contrast, the theoretical domains approach does not identify \nsuch patterns, therefore does not guide analysis, and thus is not an attempt to \nreplace theories.  Hence a further step is needed to move from an investigation \nbased on the TDI to identify theories that are relevant to the target behaviour.  \n \nSecond, the TDI was designed for situations in which guidelines for clinical practice \nare based on extensive and high quality clinical evidence. The theoretical domains \nmay be of less utility in situations where the evidence to support guideline \ndevelopment is less clear-cut, as it is possible that the effect of potential predictors \nmay be overwhelmed by the influence of variations in attitude (i.e., different beliefs \nabout the consequences of more restrictive transfusion practice). Hence, it was \npossible that consideration of a broad range of factors in this context would be \nfruitless. However, from analysis of the interview data, there was evidence that a \nrange of domains, as well as of beliefs about consequences, were relevant.  \n \nAnalysis of the interview data also indicated that specific constructs nested within the \nrelevant domains were applicable to transfusion behaviour in this context.  This led to \nthe selection of seven theoretical frameworks as appropriate for further investigation \nof transfusion behaviour by critical care consultants.  The seven frameworks were: \nthe Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1991); the intuitive Knowledge-Attitude-\nBehaviour model (Johnston et al., 2003); Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1998); \nOperant Learning Theory (Skinner, 1953); Normative Model of Work Team \nEffectiveness (Hackman, 1983), Control Theory (Carver & Scheier, 1981) and Action \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 17 \nPlanning approaches (Gollwitzer, 1999; Sniehotta et al., 2006).  It is perhaps not \nsurprising that these theories emerged as relevant.  Most of them have amassed a \nlarge evidence base not only for health-related behaviours in general but also for \nclinical behaviours in particular (e.g., Bonetti et al., 2006; Eccles et al., 2007, Walker, \nGrimshaw & Armstrong, 2001).  \n \nWhat, then, can be learned from this study? \nWith respect to transfusion practice in ICU and NICU, and in particular for patients \nwith borderline haemoglobin, clinical evidence suggests that it is advisable to watch \nand wait instead of transfusing more often than occurs in current practice. Changing \ncurrent behaviour first requires an understanding of the factors most likely to \ninfluence practice. This study provides some evidence that the key factors are \nknowledge of the evidence base (in particular, in the context of neonatology), beliefs \nabout the consequences of monitoring rather than transfusing (particularly, avoiding \nthe risks associated with transfusion), beliefs about capabilities (particularly, when \nthe patient\u2019s condition is unstable), social influences (particularly, the influence of the \nclinical team) and behavioural regulation (particularly, the use of self-monitoring, \nfeedback and planning alternative patient management strategies). Interventions \ndesigned to change practice are therefore more likely to be effective if they target \nthese domains. Interventions are less likely to be effective if they target the domains \nfor which there is no evidence of relevance: skills; motivation and goals; memory, \nattention and decision processes; environmental context and resources; emotion; \nand nature of the behaviour. \n \nTo date, the largest evidence base relating to guideline dissemination and \nimplementation strategies (Grimshaw, Thomas, MacLennan, Fraser, Ramsay, Vale \net al., 2004) was a systematic review of 235 studies reporting 309 comparisons. This \nreview identified that approximately 86% of interventions resulted in improved health \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 18 \ncare. However, considerable variation in effects led these authors to recommend the \ndevelopment of \u201ca coherent theoretical framework of health professional and \norganisational behaviour and behaviour change to inform better choice of \ninterventions\u201d (p. 4). The current study is one attempt to develop a method for \nselecting such a theoretical framework. \n \nAt the methodological level, this study shows that, for problem-driven research (such \nas behaviour change that is needed for clinicians to translate medical evidence into \npractice), taking a broad and systematic approach to the selection of appropriate \ntheories may be fruitful. In particular, using the theoretical domains framework \nresulted in greater breadth of potential explanations than would be achieved if only a \nsingle theoretical model had been adopted. However, although we have tried to \ndescribe the consensus methods used to select these theories, this is only the start \nof a process that we hope will result in a clearly definable, replicable method. We \nwould not argue that the methods used here were perfect, merely that they are an \nimprovement on the common practice of using a limited range of theories to address \na problem of behaviour change.  In particular, lack of inter-rater reliability data was a \nlimitation. \n \nA further note of caution is needed.  The theoretical domains interview (TDI) \ngenerates hypotheses about the factors influencing behaviour; it does not identify \nevidence that these are influences. The interviews elicit attributions (Weiner, 1986) \nthat clinicians make about their own and others\u2019 clinical behaviours.  This provides \nimportant information about how people explain their own behaviour and what they \nthink might change it, but is not as convincing as a predictive quantitative study \ndesigned to identify the variables that predict the behaviour, or an experimental study \nthat intervenes to change behaviour.  Hence, the importance of this approach lies in \nthe potential for improving the efficiency and effectiveness with which certain theories \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 19 \nare selected to predict, explain and change behaviour.  Thus, we plan to follow this \nstudy with an empirical predictive study using the identified theoretical frameworks to \npredict clinical transfusion behaviour in ICU and NICU. \n \nFurthermore, many theories predict or explain behaviour (thereby identifying the \nconstructs to target for change) and there are many techniques that can change \nbehaviour, but there are few theories that incorporate the techniques of change.  \n(Notable exceptions are Learning theory, Skinner 1953, Social Cognitive Theory, \nBandura 1998 and Control Theory, Carver & Scheier 1981.)  Hence, the selection of \nappropriate behaviour change techniques involves an additional step: mapping \npredictor constructs on to behaviour change techniques (Michie et al., 2008). \n \nIn conclusion, the \u2018theoretical domains\u2019 approach has identified theories that appear \nto be relevant to transfusion behaviour. It has generated hypotheses about influential \nfactors that can be systematically investigated in future studies designed to predict \nand change transfusion practice in adult and neonatal intensive care units.  These \nprinciples are potentially generalisable to a range of other health contexts. \n \n \n \nBRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY 2009: 14, 625\u2013646. \n 20 \nReferences \nAjzen, I. (1991).
