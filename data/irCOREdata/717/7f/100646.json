However, the development of\nthis glass technology in planar platforms currently lags a\ngeneration behind conventional glass ssilica basedd inte-\ngrated optic research and development. A highly nonlinear\nIR and transmitting thin film\/planar device can effectively\noperate in a variety of systems, e.g., optical switches and\nlasers, modulators, sensors, grating based devices, IR radia-\ntion conduits, antireflection coatings, data storage, and gen-\neration of supercontinuum.1\u20134 Some examples of highly non-\nlinear materials include As\u2013S, As\u2013Se, Ge\u2013S, Ge\u2013Se\u2013Te,\nand Ga\u2013La\u2013S. The increasing sophistication of the indus-\ntries requiring optical thin films from unconventional mate-\nrials calls for alternative fabrication methods to be matured,\nwhich is the subject of this letter.5\nIn the highly nonlinear and IR transmitting family of\nmaterials, in particular the chalcogenide glasses sChGsd, the\nsynthesis of thin films have been reported.6\u20139 Chalcogenide\nglasses contain elements from group VI of the periodic table\nas glass-forming anions and are generally opaque in the vis-\nible, with the exception of some sulphide glasses, and exhibit\ntransparency extending into the longer infrared wavelengths\ns5\u201315 mmd as compared with conventional glasses. The high\nnonlinear refractive index, enhanced IR transmission coupled\nwith reduced phonon energy, and the ability to exhibit local-\nized photoinduced material changes sreversible or irrevers-\nibled, suggest these glasses are indeed fascinating candidates\nfor planar waveguide development. A noteworthy member of\nthe ChG family is the gallium lanthanum sulphide\nsGa:La:Sd glass system, having an optical transparency be-\ntween 0.5 and 10 mm, a high glass transition temperature\nsTgd of 580 \u00b0C, high solubility of rare-earths, transition, and\nprecious metals se.g., silver and platinumd and controllable\nphotosensitivity.10 In addition, it has been reported that\nGa:La:S optical glass has the highest optical nonlinearity as\ncompared with other glasses s200 times higher than conven-\ntional silica glassd.11 This suggests single-mode operating\nGa:La:S glass planar waveguides could potentially be ben-\neficial in a variety of nonlinear applications, e.g., generation\nof supercontinuum to realize optical coherence tomography\nsystems and ultrafast all-optical switching. Thin films of\nGa:La:S glass have previously been deposited using pulsed\nlaser deposition over a relatively small surface area s1 cm2d.\nThis was with limited success as multicomponent materials\ntend to preferentially separate sdue to largely varying vapor\npressuresd and deposit in a stoichiometrically homogeneous\nmanner.\n9 However, the fabrication of stoichiometrically ho-\nmogeneous thin films, from a multicomponent fluoride glass\nsystem, has been reported utilizing an alternative\ntechnique.12 In our previous work, we have presented the\ntechnique of inverted deposition of the molten phase com-\nbined with high velocity spinning for the development of\nchalcogenide thin films.13 In this letter, we further this work\nthrough the demonstration of single-mode and low propaga-\ntion loss buried planar waveguides in Ga:La:S ChG for\nhighly nonlinear integrated optics.\nThe rheological analysis of a material moving in re-\nsponse to a specified speed and exposed to a certain force\ninvolves the understanding of shear stress and shear rate.\nShear stress is used to quantify the magnitude of a force\ndriving a flow process and shear rate quantifies the speed of\nany flow deformation. For a small section of a liquid where a\nforce, F, is acting over an area, A, across the top surface, the\nratio of force to area gives shear stress std across the liquid\nand the response of the liquid to flow. A velocity gradient\nforms between the surfaces of the liquid and this is known as\nthe shear rate sDd with the viscosity shd defined as the ratio\nof the shear stress to the shear rate. Newtonian fluids exhibit\na linear relationship between shear stress and shear rate, with\nviscosity independent of the applied shear conditions. In the\ncase of a polymer film, deposition using spin coating accel-\nerates the coating material sfluidd deposited in the center of a\nsubstrate. This complex process involves a balance between\ncentrifugal forces, controlled by spin velocity, and viscous\nforces which are determined by fluid viscosity and theadElectronic mail: mkam@orc.soton.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 86, 094102 s2005d\n0003-6951\/2005\/86~9!\/094102\/3\/$22.50 \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics86, 094102-1\nDownloaded 03 Jun 2009 to 131.227.178.130.

A higher material viscosity\nsdependent on temperatured, low spin velocity, and a shorter\nspin time can lead toward thicker films. Furthermore, varia-\ntion in any of these parameters will undoubtedly influence\nthe uniformity and thickness of the coating. The inverted\ndeposition technique utilized in this work is analogous to the\nconventional polymer spin coating albeit the deposited ma-\nterial is molten rather than solution. The flow of viscous\nliquids on a rotating disk has been solved where the thick-\nness, h, of an initially uniform nonvolatile Newtonian liquid\nat time t, on a rotating disk14\nh =\nh0\nf1 + s4h0\n2trv2\/3hd1\/2g\n, s1d\nwhere h0 is the initial film thickness, r is the liquid density,\nv is the angular velocity, and h is the solution viscosity.\nFrom Eq. s1d, the theoretical thickness of a Ga:La:S glass\nfilm, with r=4000 kg m\u22123 and h=0.1 P sGa:La:S glass at\n1150 \u00b0Cd, can be obtained. For h0=1 mm and a spin velocity\nof 2000 rpm sv=314 rad s\u22121d for 10 s, the theoretical film\nthickness achieved is ,4.4 mm. Equation s1d does not ac-\ncount for increased viscosity with time, as would be the case,\ndue to the rapid quench of a small volume of molten glass.\nFabrication of the Ga:La:S ChGs used in the experi-\nments was carried out from prepared batches of powder pre-\ncursors processed within our laboratories with a purity ex-\nceeding 99.999%. These glass precursors were loaded into a\nvitreous carbon crucible while in a controlled nitrogen atmo-\nsphere. The precursors are nonvolatile at the glass melting\ntemperature s1150 \u00b0C for up to 24 hd and were heated in an\nopen sargon purgedd atmosphere, after which the melt was\nquenched and annealed. Glasses with a typical molar com-\nposition of 72.5 Ga2S3:21.5 La2S3:6 La2O3 for the cladding\nsubstrates sn=2.3475 at 1 mmd and core glass compositions\ngiven in Table I were prepared. The thermal characteristics\nof the Ga:La:S glasses used in this work were then investi-\ngated with differential thermal sPerkin-Elmer DTA 7d and\nthermo-mechanical analyzers sPerkin-Elmer 7d. This thermal\nequipment was calibrated prior to any measurements and\nbackground subtraction was performed with measurements\nhaving an error margin of \u00b11.5 \u00b0C. The DTA allowed evalu-\nation of characteristic thermal events, at 10 \u00b0C min\u22121, that\nrequire sendothermicd or release sexothermicd heat as a func-\ntion of temperature. The DTA thermograms showed distinct\nevents starting with glass transition sTgd where glass solid\nand liquid phases intersect, followed by the onset of sTxd and\npresentation of a crystallization peak sTpd sheating rate influ-\nences onset of all these eventsd. To function effectively as an\noptical waveguide, it is crucial for the deposited film to be\namorphous. Therefore, the separation of the peak and the\nonset of crystallization temperature sTp\u2013Txd is required to be\nsuitably broad\ns.25 \u00b0Cd. A narrow separation s25 \u00b0Cd suggests a well-\ndefined crystalline event which will have structural preva-\nlence over any amorphous lattice configuration. However,\ncareful optimization of glass network former, modifier, and\nstabilizer content can result in significant suppression of\ncrystal phases and favor the formation of an amorphous\nstructure within the quenched film. The thermal expansion\ncoefficient, a, of the studied glasses was assessed with a\nTMA having an operation load of 10 mN. Sample height\ndeformation as a function of temperature, measured between\n300 and 500 \u00b0C increased at 10 \u00b0C min\u22121, allowed deriva-\ntion of a. A table of the studied Ga:La:S glass compositions\nGLS1\u20133 is shown in Table I. As is prerequisite for the core\nglass, the substrate is also required to be suitably resistant\nagainst crystallization due to the nature of this particular thin\nfilm fabrication process. For GLS1 the Tp\u2013Tx figure was\nmeasured to be 52 \u00b0C. Also the observed weak exothermic\ncrystalline event sTpd suggests this composition was suffi-\nciently resistant against crystallization and was selected as\nthe substrate material. In the case of selecting a suitable core\nglass a higher lanthanum content is required, as compared\nwith the cladding glass, as this leads to increased material\npolarizability as seen in GLS2 sn=2.3901 at 1 mmd and\nGLS3 sn=2.3674 at 1 mmd. For GLS2 and GLS3, a value of\n21 and 31 \u00b0C was measured, respectively, as the Tp\u2013Tx fig-\nure and their observed exothermic crystalline events sTpd\nwere more prominent than GLS1 sGLS2 more so than GLS3d.\nThese thermal analysis results suggest GLS3 is more resistant\nagainst crystallization as compared with GLS2 and a superior\ncomposition for use in this thin film fabrication process. The\nthermal expansion coefficients for GLS1\u20133 glasses were mea-\nsured to be within \u00b10.15310\u22126 \u00b0C\u22121 of each other. Dispar-\nate thermal expansion coefficients between the substrate and\ndeposited film can result in structural damage during cooling\nto ambient conditions.\nEach substrate shaped as a disk had a diameter and\nthickness of 29 by 2 mm, respectively, and was optically\npolished on the top and bottom face. An optically flat polish\non the material deposition surface is essential as this en-\nhances interfacial uniformity between the deposited film and\nsubstrate. The fabrication of buried planar waveguides of\nGa:La:S glass involved three primary stages as shown in\nFig. 1.

The preheated Ga:La:S glass substrate\ns,540 \u00b0Cd is dipped approximately 1 mm into the molten\nGa:La:S glass. It is vital that the substrate surface is com-\npletely wet with molten glass during this stage. Normally a\nsubstantial excess of coating fluid is deposited in comparison\nwith the final film thickness. During the second stage the\nsubstrate is withdrawn, within 200 ms after contact, from the\nmolten glass surface but still positioned within the walls of\nthe crucible. The excess molten deposited glass on the sub-\nstrate surface forms a meniscus as it drips back into the cru-\ncible. Positioning the substrate as such is a precautionary\nstage as any molten glass expelled from the substrate surface\nduring the third stage sspin cycled is collected within the\ncrucible. The third stage is typically characterized by the\nexpulsion of deposited fluid from the substrate surface\nthrough a rotational motion. The substrate is accelerated to a\npreset angular velocity for a specified duration and when\nspinning at a constant rate, viscous forces dominate fluid\nthinning. The crucible is fully withdrawn from the substrate\n2 s after the spin cycle has started. This reduces the effects of\nthermal radiation, emanating from the hot crucible and mol-\nten glass below, which can retard the quench of the deposited\nfilm. The deposited molten film thins out and cools until the\nviscosity is too high for further flow to occur. Following the\nthird stage, the substrate and deposited amorphous film are\nannealed at 540 \u00b0C for 1 h and then slowly cooled, at\n1 \u00b0C min\u22121, to an ambient temperature.\nIn Fig. 2, a disk with spun thin films fabricated using the\naforementioned technique, a planar optical chip with a buried\nwaveguide and a substrate from the Ga:La:S glass system is\nshown. The planar optical chip has been cut from a spun film\ndisk and can be scaled in size to suit an application. The\nabove-mentioned three-step process was used for the initial\ndeposition of the 18-mm-thick core layer fFig. 3sadg and was\nrepeated for a second deposition of an overcladding layer\ns.40 mm thickd fFig. 3sbdg. The spin velocity and spin time\nparameters used for the initial core deposition was 4000 rpm\nfor 15 s and the overcladding layer was 3500 rpm for 10 s.\nThe overcladding surface uniformity was measured to be\nbetter than 0.5 mm across 25 mm sprofiled with a Tencor\natomic force microscoped. It was observed that spinning at\nlower velocities yielded thicker films which normally had a\nlarger area of surface uniformity, almost covering the entire\ndisk area. However, if a thinner core film of several microns\nis desired, an overcladding layer can be spun onto the thick\ncore film. This process of thinning out a thick spun film by\nspinning an overcladding layer is through remelting and re-\nflowing of the viscous glass, hence reduction of the core\nlayer size to 6 mm. A planar chip was cut and end-face pol-\nished from this spun disk. The propagation loss at 1.064 mm\nfor the film shown in Fig. 3sbd was ,0.2 dB cm\u22121 over a\n15 mm path length indicating good transmission and low\nscattering requirements for many applications. In addition,\nobservation and measurements of the guided laser mode,\nshown in Fig. 3scd, was performed with a CCD camera, and\nit was observed that the guided laser output was in funda-\nmental spatial-mode. Experimental mode size s1\/e2 inten-\nsityd was 7.5 mm in the vertical direction. This was con-\nfirmed with a software mode-solver giving a good theoretical\nmatch of 7.7 mm. The size of the waveguide mode would\nappear to be larger than the physical dimensions of the wave-\nguide structure indicative of single mode behavior.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated the fabrication of\nhighly nonlinear buried planar chalcogenide waveguides us-\ning a modified version of the conventional spin coating tech-\nnique. An infrared transmitting Ga:La:S chalcogenide glass\nwas used to produce uniform films. The optimization of ther-\nmally and chemically superior chalcogenide glass, quenched\nin air without oxygenation or devitrification was necessary.\nUniform films and waveguides of Ga:La:S glass were mea-\nsured to be single-mode in operation and had ,0.2 dB cm\u22121\npropagation loss, suitable for use in highly nonlinear inte-\ngrated optics requiring ultrafast all-optical switching and the\ngeneration of supercontinuum.\nThis work was supported by EPSRC Grant No. GR\/\nR941 21\/01.\n1G.
