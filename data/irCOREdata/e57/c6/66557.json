This raises important questions as to how best to conceptualise the \nprocesses re-shaping economic  geographies within Europe. It also raises \npressing practical and political issues and about their implications for territorial \ninequalities and uneven development in Europe. For two decades there was \nsome evidence of slow convergence in regional economic performance \n(Canaleta et al, 2002); but in last decade or so this would seem to have been \nreversed as processes of European Union (EU) enlargement and deepening \nintegration have accelerated. These gaps will further widen with the future as \nthe eastward expansion of the EU (CEC, 2001). The evolving geographies of \nEurope\u2019s economies have altered in response to this new map of \nopportunities and threats. \n \nThe argument I advance here is that these changing geographies are a \nproduct of the inter-play of (inter-alia) corporate, state and trades union \nstrategies, as companies pursue profitability, trades unions and workers seek \nnew employment and\/or protect existing jobs, and states attempt to balance \nthe pursuit of accumulation in their territory with the claims of equity and \nsocio-spatial justice. Geographies of economies are seen as contingent \noutcomes of the co-evolution of the asymmetric power relationships between \nthese individual and collective actors and institutions. Conceptually, this \nrepresents an attempt to combine aspects of political economy and \ninstitutional approaches to facilitate understanding of the evolution of \neconomies and their geographies, and recognise the variety of ways in which \nagency and action and the structural determinants of capitalist economies co-\nevolve in particular ways1. However, the context in which these processes of \nco-evolution occur is important \u2013 one of political-economic processes of \nEuropeanisation and globalisation \u2013 for these are both a partial product of the \nstrategies of companies, states and trades unions and in turn help set the \nparameters which shape these processes.  \n \nThe on-going evolution of the EU is of particular relevance here. The \nexpansion of the EU and, even more so, the collapse of state socialism, have \nbeen critical in re-defining the spaces open to companies in Europe.  The \nenlargements into southern Europe in the 1980s, the incorporation of the \nGDR following German re-unification, and the expansions of the 1990s to take \nin Austria, Finland and Sweden have all dramatically enlarged the extent of \nthe EU\u2019s territory. The forthcoming incorporation of states in CEE as they \nmeet the economic and political criteria taken as indicative of their transition to \ncapitalist economies and liberal democratic polities will further expand the EU, \nIn practice pre-accession trade and aid arrangements are already closely \ninter-twining the economies of the applicants (especially the Czech Republic, \nHungary and Poland, the most likely initial entrants) with those of the EU. The \nSingle European Market programme and the creation of the Euro currency \nrepresent the latest stages in an on-going process of deepening economic \u2013 \n                                                          \n1 For a fuller elaboration of this position, see Hudson, 2001. \n 3\nand increasingly political \u2013integration. Together these processes of deepening \nand widening constitute the formative moments in this process of re-drawing \nthe map of Europe. This re-definition of the European space is in turn one \nmoment in broader global processes, as new forms of capitalist uneven \ndevelopment emerge and evolve.  \n \nThe production, appropriation and realisation of surplus-value and associated \nvalue flows and the governance and regulatory processes that make them \npossible are fundamental to understanding the (re)configuration of economic \nactivity and the meaning of regional development. As Hadjimichalis (1987) \nemphasises, transfers of value are inherently geographical.  Consequently, \nthese changes offer new opportunities to both companies and regions, but \nthey also pose potential threats to both. In particular, companies may fail if \nthey are unable to come to terms with the new competitive terrain while \nregions may be endangered if they are unable to secure and hold down a \nplace in circuits of value creation, circulation and appropriation. Consequently, \nit is necessary to understand the bases of the co-evolution and \n(in)compatibility of corporate and regional development interests \n \n \nConceptualising changing geographies of economies in the \nEU: the social construction of production systems \n \nCorporate competitive strategies encompass a variety of practices and \napproaches, which can usefully be summarised in terms of \u2018weak\u2019 and \u2018strong\u2019 \ncompetition. \u2018Weak\u2019 competition revolves around securing competitive \nadvantage within a given technical-organisation paradigm of production by \nseeking cheaper sources of inputs to production than are available to \ncompetitors \u2013 for example of raw material or labour. \u2018Strong\u2019 (or \nSchumpeterian) competition involves seeking to gain advantage by re-\ndefining production paradigms via a variety of innovations  (product, process, \norganisational, with these often inter-linked). In addition, in both forms of \ncompetition, firms may collaborate via a variety of \u2018networking\u2019 strategies, \ninvolving sub-contracting and out-sourcing of a production of components and \nservices.  Strategic alliances, acquisitions and mergers represent other \nlonger-term options, which may be used in pursuit of either \u2018weak\u2019 or \u2018strong\u2019 \ncompetition. But the key point is that these are analytic distinctions. Firms \npursue these analytically distinct strategies simultaneously.  \n \nMoreover, firms characteristically co-operate in various way with other firms. \nRecognition that production involves inter-firm co-operation highlights the \nnecessity to conceptualise production as a system organised across as well \nas within firm boundaries2. A production system may be defined as a \ndistinctive form of organisation of production with corresponding technical \n(intra-firm) and social (inter-firm and sector) divisions of labour and modes of \nregulation, each with their own geographies, thereby emphasising the ways in \n                                                          \n2 Production systems therefore involve conceptualising the economy as constituted through \ncomplex and recursive flows rather than in terms of linear flows - for example, in terms of \nproduction fili\u00e8res, commodity chains or value chains. \n 4\nwhich production is embedded in particular socio-spatial settings (Dicken et \nal. 1995). To variable extents, the strategies that individual firms can pursue \nare constrained by sectoral governance arrangements. Within these \nconstraints, firms have different degrees of power and influence, with \nimportant implications for geographies of production and the economic \nsuccess of firms. Some forms of networked relationships involve relatively \negalitarian \u2018horizontal\u2019 inter-firm relations \u2013 most notably in the arch-typical \nindustrial districts of central and north east Italy. More generally, however, \nthere are complex, variable and asymmetric geometries of power and \ninfluence that link firms into production systems. While some \u2018lead\u2019 firms \nexercise considerable power and influence and have a choice of \u2018strong\u2019 or \n\u2018weak\u2019 competitive strategies, others in subordinate positions are typically \nconstrained to pursue strategies of \u2018weak\u2019 competition. Moreover, depending \nupon the character of the product, the location of \u2019lead\u2019 firms within the \nstructure of the production system can differ markedly3. The locations of these \nfirms, and decisions as to the location of different stages of production within \nand between firms (that is, the spatial distribution of the technical and social \ndivisions of labour), has important ramifications for geographies of value \nproduction, transfer and appropriation and for the developmental possibilities \nand trajectories of different places. \n \nAs well as companies, workers and trades unions seek to influence the \nlocation of economic activities (Herod, 2001).  Although in a structurally weak \nposition relative to capital, unions can nonetheless, in specific circumstances, \ninfluence corporate (dis)investment strategies and geographies of production. \nHowever, trades unions occupy ambiguous position in seeking to influence \neconomic geographies. While uniting fractions of the working class, trades \nunions at the same time divide that class \u2013 for example, by industry, \noccupation, gender and territory (Hudson, 2001, 217-54). Because of this, \ntrades unions have become involved in inter-territorial competitions for \nemployment and investment, sometimes in collaboration with companies \nwhose interests are tied to particular places (Beynon and Hudson, 1993; \nHudson, 2000, 201-26). In some circumstances social and environmental \ngroups constituted in civil society  also seek to influence the geography of \nproduction systems, usually by developing countervailing sources of power to \ncontest corporate decisions.  \n \nTo variable extents, the strategies of individual firms, trades unions and other \nsocial groups are constrained by modes of supra-national and national state \nregulation. There are three main ways in which states become involved with \n                                                          \n3 Perhaps the best known stylised recognition of this is Gereffi\u2019s (1994) distinction between \n\u2018buyer-driven\u2019 and \u2018producer driven\u2019 commodity chains \u2013 with the former characterising \nconsumer goods sectors (such as clothing) requiring relatively simple, typically labour-\nintensive, manufacturing processes in which the dominant actors are major retailing chains, \nthe latter characterising more complex consumer goods (such as cars), capital goods (for \ninstance, aircraft), or basic manufactured materials (such as steel), which require capital-\nintensive and technically sophisticated high-volume manufacturing and in which the \u2018lead\u2019 \nfirms are core manufacturing companies that produce the final product. While this \ndichotomisation is too simplistic, not allowing for more complex power geometries of \ngovernance, it nonetheless is useful in drawing attention to differences between firms and \nindustries.   \n 5\nregulation of the economy4. Firstly, they define the rules and laws that define \nacceptable conduct in market transactions. Secondly, they seek directly to \ninfluence the actions of others in markets\u2013 for example, via financial \nincentives that attempt to influence the location of private sector investments \nand decisions as to currency exchange rates. Thirdly, they may replace the \nprivate sector as a provider of goods and services and the market as the \nallocative mechanism (for example, by taking industries into public \nownership).  \n \nState polices can be thought of as organised \u2018horizontally\u2019 by spatial scale and \n\u2018vertically\u2019 by substantive domain. For example, vertically, there are divisions \nin terms of policies for labour and product markets, competition, merger and \nacquisition, research, technology and development, and trade. Horizontally, \nthere are important distinctions between the supra-national EU, national \nstates and sub-national units, linked in various ways in pursuit of economic \ndevelopment at different scales. It is, however, important to recognise that the \nnational retains a key role in this new multi-scalar architecture5, not least in \nshaping the scope and extent of local and regional economic development \nstrategies and modes of governance (Ache and Wood, 2000). The growing \nemphasis upon governance is symptomatic of the increasing involvement of a \nrange of social actors from within civil society in the formulation and \nimplementation of local and regional economic development policies. In the \nEU there is \u201ca discernible move towards stressing the institutional agency of \nterritories in enhancing their own regional economic development prospects \nand enhancing cohesion\u201d within complex multi-level and multi-scalar systems \nof government and governance, as new scales and scalar  architectures of \ngovernance and regulation are created and change\u201d6. However,  \u201cthe region is \n[not] automatically endowed with the agency to modify network positions and \nplay the games of \u2018scale politics\u2019\u201d (Lagendijk et al, 2000, 1 and 14). Moreover, \nthere are marked differences in the capacities and capabilities of regions to \nexercise such agency7.  \n \n                                                          \n4 For a fuller discussion, see Hudson, 2001, 76-91 \n5 Clearly in certain spheres, especially related to monetary policy and movements of capital, \nthe regulatory capacities of national states have been markedly reduced \u2013 though even in \nthese cases (not least, the Euro), this is often a result of political decisions by national states. \nMore generally, however, national states remain significant sites of regulatory power within \nEurope and the \u201dhollowing out\u201d metaphor denotes one aspect of a broader set of changes of \nstate re-organisation. These encompass changes in the forms and modalities of national state \ninvolvement in more complex multi-scalar architectures of governance and regulation within \nEurope, rather than some simplistic diminution in national government\u2019s regulatory role (for \nexample, see Jessop, 1997). \n6 The growing emphasis upon regional action reflects political processes of decentralisation to \nregions to enhance their powers as political subjects and claims that the economic \nperformance of firms depends upon external resources, in particular on their close interaction \nwith other firms, facilitated and enhanced by spatial proximity and co-location: Hudson, 2001, \n268-81.  \n7 Nonetheless, the combined effects of these intellectual and political developments has been \nfocus attention upon the cultural and social resources of regions, and processes such as \nlearning, that are claimed to underpin collective behaviour and economic success at the \nregional level as part of cultural and institutional turns in economic geography (for example, \nMorgan, 1995: Storper, 1995; Hudson, 2000, 92-108).   \n \n 6\nIn summary, geographies of production systems, and the ways in which they \nchange, are seen to be a result of the interaction of corporate, trades union \nand state policies, linked within complex webs of power relations. While \nstructurally loaded in the favour of capital (especially multinationals) and \nstates (especially powerful national states), it by no means follows that the \ndeterminants of a given decision as to the how, what and where of production \nwithin Europe (or indeed beyond it) simply follow from this as these are \ncontested processes. The ways in which the causal powers of structural \nrelations unfold is a contingent matter (Massey, 1995: 303-4).  In the next \nsection I explore this proposition in the context of the changing political-\neconomic space of Europe, especially linked to the ways in which the \nsuccessive expansions of the EU have created both threats and opportunities \nfor companies and places.  \n \n \nChanging economic geographies in the new Europe: some \nindustrial examples \n \nClothing: the interaction of the search for cheaper labour, product \nmarket changes and changing regulatory r\u00e9gimes  \n \nLabour costs form some 60% of total production costs in clothing (Scheffer, \n1994). Consequently the clothing industry is particularly sensitive to labour \ncost variations, an emblematic example of an industry in which \u201cweak\u201d \ncompetitive strategies based on cost cutting remain pivotal and in which a \n\u2018spatial fix\u2019 (Harvey, 1982, 390-393), the geographical relocation of production \nto enhance or preserve the viability of a particular socio-technical model of \nproduction, has repeatedly been used as a production strategy.  \n \nThe survival of clothing production in areas of Europe (above all, those in \nnorth west Europe) with high labour costs requires corporate strategies of \n\u2018strong\u2019 competition, based on dimensions such as high product quality and \ndesign8. But such niche production is necessarily limited in terms of market \nextent and high volume production remains important and very sensitive to \nlabour cost differences. The initial corporate response to increasing costs and \nlabour shortages in north west Europe was to locate clothing production in \nperipheral, typically de-industrialised, regions, often with no history of the \nclothing industry and with large masses of women looking for work  - for \nexample the Ruhr and north east England (Hudson, 2000, 71).  \n \nThe next phase of \u201cspatial fixes\u201d involved seeking out lower costs locations in \nother parts of Europe, both those within the EU but more particularly those \noutside the EU but tied into it economically via various trade and aid \nschemes9. In the 970s and 1980s clothing was a \u2018classic\u2019 industry in terms of \nshaping the (then) \u2018new\u2019 international division of labour (Fr\u00f6bel et al, 1980). \n                                                          \n8 Home-working in such areas may allow labour costs to be held down (especially when the \nworkers are women from ethnic minorities, both legal and illegal migrants) but production \norganised in this way will generally be on a relatively small scale. \n9 Note that this extended south of the Mediterranean to the countries of the Maghreb (see \nJoekes, 1982). \n 7\nThere was a significant shift in clothing production from northern to parts of \nsouthern Europe, with a resultant growth in export-oriented inward \ninvestment, output and employment there, especially given the prospect of \nentry to the EU and pre-accession aid (Hudson and Lewis, 1985). For \nexample, in Portugal large factories were established in the metropolitan \nareas of Lisbon and Oporto, owned by USA, European and Japanese \ncompanies, producing ready-to-wear garments largely for export and sale to \nEuropean middle class consumers. With the entry of Greece, Portugal and \nSpain to the EU in the 1980s, there were enhanced levels of inward \ninvestment, with substantial support via EU regional policy funding (Thiel et al, \n2000).  \n \nMore significantly, this spatial shift provided opportunities for clothing \nproducers in southern Europe to access markets in north west Europe, \nresulting in more complex geographies of clothing production and trade. This \ncreation of new forms of inter-firm relations was, however, dominated by \nmajor western European clothing retailers. One indication of this is that two \nthirds of total EU clothing imports are directed to retailers, either as a result of \ntheir own actions or those of their own or contracted agents. As Scheffer \n(1994, 11) puts it, \u201ctrade in clothing and textiles appears more to be master-\nminded by agents in the importing countries\u201d. Thus key decisions about \ndesign, marketing and quality were taken by major retailers and\/or sub-\ncontracting clothing manufacturers in northern Europe, as part of an emerging \nqualitative spatial division of labour within the clothing production system in \nEurope. \n \nFurthermore, such retail firms re-organised the clothing market as part of their \ncompetitive strategies. On the one hand, they have increasingly segmented \nthe market socially and spatially; on the other hand, they have shortened \nproduct life cycles and blurred the established pattern of spring \/summer and \nautumn\/winter collections. Together, these changes have had significant \nimpacts on the geography of clothing production and trade, increasing \npressures for smaller batch and flexible production. They have further shifted \npower to the major retailers and \u201cas a result, the interface between the \nproduction and commercialisation of clothing has become the pivotal point in \nthe fili\u00e8re since from there both upstream and downstream activities can be \ncontrolled effectively\u201d (Thiel et al, 2000, 111). \n \nIn the 1990s, however, new possibilities for \u2018spatial fixes\u2019 began to open up \nfollowing the political changes of 1989, which led to even lower costs labour \nlocations becoming available in CEE.  Labour costs per standard minute in \nCEE were 70% of those in the UK and 33% of those in Germany (Dicken, \n1998)10. These differentials constituted a strong attraction to companies \nbased elsewhere in Europe. Echoing the earlier shift to sourcing from \nsouthern Europe, major retail chains increasingly switched orders to CEE via \na variety of contracting arrangements (Dunford  et al, 2001), while clothing \nproduction companies looked to locate there, to lower production costs. As a \nconsequence, there has been significant restructuring of the clothing industry \n                                                          \n10 In absolute terms, less than those in the under 0.25 DM per standard minute in CEE, \ncompared to at least 0.35 DM per standard minute in the UK and 0.75 DM in Germany \n 8\nin other European countries. Clothing producers and retailers have \nconcentrated upon higher value added design, marketing, planning and \ncontrol activity while outsourcing parts of the production process to CEE \n(Pavl\u00ednek, 1998; Begg and Pickles, 2000). This led to further plant closures \nand employment decline in both north western and also parts of southern \nEurope.   \n \nAs well as the closure of mass production factories and branch plants, this \nalso involved the \u2018hollowing out\u2019 of formerly coherent industrial districts \nproducing high-value fashion clothing, such as Herning-Ikast in Jutland \n(Denmark). Companies decentralised the most labour intensive and physically \ndemanding stages of production to low labour cost areas in Poland, while \nmaintaining R&D, marketing and control functions in Jutland (Dunford and \nHudson, 1996).  As a result, between 1984 and 1994 clothing employment \nfell, often dramatically, in all of the then 12 EU Member States with the \nexception of Portugal, where there was a modest 6.5% increase.   \n \nMore recently, cost pressures on EU producers have further intensified, \nleading to further reductions in clothing production and employment. This has \nsharply affected \u2018peripheral\u2019 regions in north west Europe, such as north east \nEngland and  Northern Ireland, ironically because of close links previously \nbuilt up between companies with production capacity there (such as Baird and \nDewhirst) and Marks and Spencer (M&S), the UK market leader11. For a \nconsiderable period of time, M&S resisted the general tendency to supply \nfrom abroad, instead seeking to contain costs by pressuring its UK suppliers \nwhile maintaining quality and its reputation for clothing \u2018made in Britain\u2019.  It did \nnot significantly shift to purchasing abroad until the early 1990s, seeking to \npreserve quality via using \u2018preferred\u2019 suppliers as a quality control mechanism \n(Crewe and Davenport, 1992). By the latter part of the 1990s intense \ncompetitive pressure in the retail clothing sector resulted in M&S desperately \nsearching for cheaper non-UK suppliers, in eastern and southern Europe and \nbeyond, and cutting back on the volume of orders to its remaining UK \nsuppliers (see Marks and Spencer, 1999). Largely as a result of this change, \nthere was a severe and rapid fall in clothing employment to 6,000 in north \neast England (compared to previous levels of over 20,000)12.  \n \nIn addition, however, the changing international configuration of production \nand trade also impacted upon clothing output and employment in southern \nEurope, as places that had experienced rapid growth in the 1980s were \nconfronted with equally sharp decline in the 1990s. For example, by the early \n1990s employment and output were declining in Portugal, particularly \nbecause German retailers switched orders to CEE. Exports from Portugal to \n                                                          \n11 One consequence of this is that for a time in the 1990s, in terms of employment, clothing \u2013  \na predominantly female-employing sector \u2013became the largest manufacturing sector in north \neast England. Many of the women subsequently losing their jobs were the sole or main \nhousehold wage earner (Hudson, 2000, 88). \n12 Other clothing retailers, such as Hennes and Moritz have also sought to source globally, in \nsearch of low cost garments at the lower end of the quality spectrum. It is worth noting that \nAsia remains the main source of textile imports to the EU (WTO, 1999), with lower labour \ncosts than eastern Europe, but eastern Europe offers significant advantages in terms of time \nand distance to western European markets. \n 9\nGermany fell sharply and clothing employment in Portugal declined by almost \n25% between 1991 and 1995 (Thiel et al, 2000)13.  \n \nThe geography of clothing production in southern Europe has also been re-\norganised in other ways, with decline in much more established areas of \nclothing production. Former industrial districts have been or are being \n\u2018hollowed out\u2019, with the geographies of their production structures increasingly \nre-organised, retaining design, marketing and HQ functions while routine \nproduction is re-located to lower cost locations in southern and, increasingly, \neastern Europe. As early as the beginning of the 1980s, the larger or leading \nclothing firms in Italian districts such as Carpi and Prato had initiated a far-\nreaching process of de-localisation of selected labour-intensive and unskilled \nstages of production. Conversely, they increasingly concentrated upon high \nquality products and those stages of production requiring skilled labour and, \nmore importantly, upon design, marketing and brand development activities \nthat were less sensitive to labour costs, as well as key HQ strategic \nfunctions14. Similar processes of the \u201chollowing out\u201d of production to \nsurrounding localities with abundant cheap labour could be observed in the \n1980s in and around the town of Kastoria in northern Greece, perhaps the \none authentic industrial district in Greece, based around the production of \nexpensive clothing from imported fur (Hadjimichalis, 1998) 15. The \u2018hollowing \nout\u2019 of industrial districts is not necessarily a simple process, however, nor \none confined to re-locating production within the national territory, as the - in \nsome ways canonical - example of Benetton illustrates. Benetton emerged as \na major clothing company as a result of a complex combination of marketing, \norganisational and process innovations. This encompassed creating a new \nglobal product image, a refined just-in-time production system incorporating \nboth out-sourcing and a critical process innovation16, and a risk-minimising \nstrategy of franchised outlets in more than one hundred countries while \nretaining key control, design and marketing functions at its base in Treviso in \nnorthern Italy (Crewe and Lowe, 1996). The boundaries of clothing industrial \ndistricts have therefore become more permeable because of the emergence \nof powerful \u2018lead\u2019 firms or gruppi, either as a result of organic growth or, more \noften, as a result of acquisition and merger activity among local firms, and the \nentry of externally-owned firms, especially larger firms that come to play \ndominant roles and shape local growth and development (Cor\u00f3 and \nGrandinetti, 1999; Whitford, 2001).  The net result is to create more complex \nstructures of ownership and more hierarchical relationships between firms, \nestablish relationships with suppliers and sub-contractors beyond the \nboundaries of the district, and fracture the former territorially bounded \n                                                          \n13 It is worth noting that this aggregate decline conceals both intra-sectoral and inter-regional \nvariation in the patterns of change in the Portuguese clothing industry. \n14 Hadjimichalis and Papamichos (1990) argue that such de-localisation tendencies also \nreflected growing resistance by women, children and marginalized workers to \u2018super-\nexploitation\u2019 in industrial districts, in strong contrast to the dominant image of these districts as \ncharacterised by egalitarian, progressive industrial relations. \n15 These observations are based upon fieldwork in and around Kastoria between 1984 and \n1992. \n16  In 1972 Benetton introduced in\u2013house dyeing at the final stage of production, crucially \nallowing piece (rather than batch) dyeing and so the dyeing of individual items to order. \n 10\ncoherence and integrity of the clothing production system within the (former) \nindustrial district. \n \nAt the same time as long-established industrial districts were being hollowed \nout and re-organised, new clothing clusters were emerging elsewhere. In CEE \nnew clusters were evolving, incorporating new forms of inter-firm relations, \nlinked into local \u201clead\u201d production firms and in turn into export markets in \nwestern Europe (Dunford et al, 2001). Similar processes were evident in parts \nof southern Europe, but focussing less on large-scale production for mass \nmarkets and more upon specialised niche production.  For example, in \nPortugal the rural areas to the north of Oporto, such as the Ave Valley, \nclusters of clothing producers increasingly focussed upon small batch \nproduction and products, for which the main modality of competition is quality \nrather than price (Thiel et al, 2000). \n \nAs indicated above, changing the geography of clothing production and trade \nin Europe crucially depended upon political changes, and changes in state \npolicies and regulatory r\u00e9gimes. Some of these related to international trade \nin general such as the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA), introduced in 1974 \nunder the aegis of GATT (Farrands, 1982), and the WTO. Others were \nspecifically European in their origins and effects, notably pre-EU accession \ntrade and aid policies in southern Europe, which effectively economically \nintegrated Greece, Portugal and Spain into the EU prior to their political \nmembership (Hudson and Lewis, 1985). Post-1989 there were parallel \nprocesses in CEE. Most significantly, until the mid-1990s the changing \ninternational division of labour in clothing within Europe was governed and \nshaped by an outward processing trade (OPT) r\u00e9gime. In this, western \nretailers and producers controlled the design, retailing and overall \nmanagement of production, co-ordinated the shipping of textile materials for \nout-processing and organised the return of the finished commodity to the west \nEuropean market. EU producers could export fabrics and re-import garments, \nwith minimal trade tariffs and customs duty charged only on the value added \nin the production of the particular item of clothing (Scheffer, 1994).  OPT \narrangements enabled western European companies to overcome import \nquotas applicable under the MFA and helped underpin their competitiveness \nin global markets. Having powerfully influenced the clothing trade between \nnorthern and southern Europe in the 1970s and 1980s, such OPT \narrangements subsequently significantly affected clothing trade patterns \nbetween the EU and countries in CEE (Graziani, 1998). CEE clothing exports \nto western Europe increased by 20 per cent annually  between 1990 and \n1998, and by 1998 represented 5% of world clothing exports. Furthermore, \nEU countries imported 18 % of their total non-EU clothing imports from CEE \ncountries17 (WTO, 1999). As Lemoine (1997: 4) has argued, \u201cOPT was the \nengine of Central and East European manufacturing exports in the early \nnineties\u201d. Although there has recently been a move away from OPT regulated \ntrade, as tariff barriers to clothing trade are removed as part of WTO \nagreements to promote free trade, OPT-type relations nevertheless seem to \n                                                          \n17 This placed CEE second only after Asia as a source of clothing imports. \n 11\ncontinue despite these changes18. This reflects lock-in within networks linking \nlow-cost producers in CEE and buyers in the EU, who are attempting to \nappropriate a greater share of surplus-value than would be possible if \nproduction was located in high cost locations \n \nIn summary, the combined result of these varied processes is that particular \ncore economic sites and regions in western Europe (headquarters of the \nmajor clothing retailers and buyers) control the \u201cgeographical transfer of \nvalue\u201d (Hadjimichalis, 1987) in this production systemr. Producers in different \nEuropean regions have varying ability to capture and appropriate value from \ncontinent-wide production and contracting networks.  Many peripheral regions \nin higher cost countries have seen their position in the production system \nchallenged by emergent and distanciated contract networks organised on a \ncontinent-wide basis. Conversely, these same contractual arrangements have \noffered opportunities for new production structures, sometimes on a \nregionalised basis, to be constructed in parts of the eastern and southern \nperipheries. Clearly there is no simple or deterministic correlation between the \nchanging scalar geography of clothing production and changes in \norganisational form and in relations between companies in the clothing \nproduction system. Such relations remain contingent and context-specific. \n \n \nAutomobile production: the interaction between a search of \nlabour markets to allow the introduction of new production \nconcepts and practices, market penetration via inward \ninvestment, and changing regulatory regimes \n \nIn recent years there has been a considerable internationalisation of EU \nautomobile production into, first, peripheral regions of northern Europe and \nsouthern Europe, and secondly, into CEE (Sadler and Swain, 1994; Hudson \nand Schamp, 1995; Pavl\u00ednek, 1998). This partly reflects substantial \ndifferences in labour costs. Of greater significance, however, are the \npossibilities radically to re-organise working practices, with consequent effects \non productivity levels, both in areas with no prior history of automobile \nproduction and in former automobile production areas, above all in CEE, in \nwhich there is little, if any, resistance to such changes. Production is \nincreasingly  \u2018Europeanised\u2019, with \u201can intricate network of \u2026  flows which \nreflect both the sourcing and marketing strategies of the major automobile \nproducers, national and transnational\u201d (Dicken et al, 1995, 4).  \n \nThe automobile production system is seen, by some, to be organised within \nEuropean-wide networks, which encompass a three-fold hierarchy of regions, \nqualitatively differentiated in terms of their role in the production system. R&D \nand high level and knowledge-intensive competencies are increasingly \nconcentrated in the core, centred on Germany ,19 as routine production, \n                                                          \n18 This is indicated in evidence from interviews with clothing firms in CEE (Dunford et al., \n2001). \n19 For example, GM established a major R&D centre at Russelsheim, with responsibility for all \nGM R&D outside the USA, employing 7,000; BMW employs more than 6,000 at its R&D \n 12\nespecially of lower value models is increasingly dispersed to the eastern and \nsouthern peripheries. This emergent hierarchy \u201cis based upon the cumulative \ncompetencies of the actors, the density of networks of relationships and \nproximity to the seats of power where strategic decisions are take on matters \neconomic, financial, scientific, technological and political, distributing other \nactivities over space \u2026\u201d (Bordenave and Lung, 1996, 320). However, creating \nsuch a regionally hierarchical Europeanised automobile production system is \ncomplicated in at least two ways. First, there is still evidence of \u2018national \nchampions\u2019 dominating in national markets (Bordenave and Lung, 1993; \nHudson and Schamp, 1995). Secondly, supply chains are being extended \nbeyond Europe (Sadler, 1999).  \n \nThe proximate cause  of these changes was the crisis of Fordist mass \nproduction in Western Europe and the collapse of the state socialist mass \nproduction model in Eastern Europe. While the latter was a consequence of \ngeo-political change, the former resulted from the maturing internal \ncontradictions of Fordist production, allied to growing competition from \nJapanese producers using just-in-time (JIT) and lean production methods. \nHowever, in the 1980s, Japanese producers seeking to increase their share of \nthe EU market via exports were confronted by two problems. First, a strongly \nappreciating yen made exports from Japan increasingly difficult. Secondly, \npolitical resistance to growing imports, reflected in voluntary export control \narrangements, limited the share of the EU market that Japanese companies \ncould acquire via importing. To increase this share, and to secure a long-term \nposition in the EU market, Japanese automobile companies were compelled \nto establish production facilities within the EU, either by foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) in green-field sites or via acquisition, merger or joint \nventures. In turn, however, Japanese companies establishing  production \nfaced the problem of introducing their own \u2018Japanese \u2019high volume flexible \nproduction (HVFP) methods in very different cultural and political settings in \nEurope. \n \nThese HVFP methods are predicated upon particular ways of organising the \nlabour process, originally quite novel in a European context, with demanding \nrequirements in terms of recruitment, working practices, and modes of labour \nrepresentation. These were difficult to introduce in regions with a history of \nautomobile production and a strong trades union culture committed to \ndefending existing working practices and wage arrangements.  Consequently, \nJapanese companies sought production sites with particular types of labour \nmarket and state regulatory r\u00e9gime and were initially attracted to the UK by \nnational government policies, fixed capital investment subsidised via regional \npolicy, plus regional labour markets characterised by high levels of \nunemployment and an abundance of  \u2018green labour\u2019. Following the initial \ninvestment in north east England by Nissan, with assembly beginning at its \nSunderland plant in 1986 (Garrahan and Stewart, 1992), there were major \n                                                                                                                                                                      \ncentre at Munich, whilst both Ford in Cologne and Mercedes in Sindelfingen, near Stuttgart, \nemploy more than 4,000 in their respective R&D centre (Hudson and Schamp, 1995). Renault \nestablished its main R&D centre at Guyancourt in St. Quentin, near Paris, while there is also \nevidence of further concentration of R&D associated with other companies in France and Italy \n(Conti and Enrietti, 1995; Savary, 1995). \n 13\ninvestments by Honda at Swindon (following its strategic alliance with British \nLeyland\/Rover, begun in 1979) and Toyota in Derbyshire, at Burnaston (see \nHudson, 1995a); Nissan subsequently invested in Spain whilst other \nJapanese companies invested elsewhere in Europe (see below).  \n \nAs the automobile production space was re-defined as European, competition \nfor major inward investment projects, both between and within national states, \nintensified. This occurred in a context of unequal power relationships between \nlarge, externally owned corporations, national states, regional development \nagencies, trades unions and local communities. National states seek to attract \nand encourage inward investment but within the constraints of an EU \nframework to regulate intra-EU international competition for investment while \nthey also define and administer the rules through which regions within their \ncountry compete between themselves and with regions elsewhere. There was \nintense competition between places for these investments. For example, \nsome 40 local authorities in the UK alone bid to secure the Nissan investment \n(Hudson, 1995b). Consequently, Nissan was able to extract a high price, both \nfinancially in terms of grant aid and also in securing local co-operation to \nensure that a variety of \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d infrastructure requirements were met. \nThis intense competition can on occasion create problems. For example, \nthere is still uncertainty as to the inducements offered to Nissan by, amongst \nothers, the now defunct Tyne and Wear Metropolitan County Council20.  \n \nEstablishing new automobile plants in locations previously devoid of such \nproduction certainly offered (and still offers) advantages to companies. \nHowever, it also posed challenges in terms of embedding factories in places, \nboth for the companies and for political actors seeking to capture such prized \ninward investment projects. In part, this was and is a relatively straightforward \nprocess in so far as it relates to providing investment grants and loans and \n\u2018hard\u2019 infrastructure and even in securing desired working practices and \nmodes of labour representation within the factory. For example, the strong \ntradition of industrial union organisation in north east England posed little in \nthe way of a problem to Nissan, and in some respects the company used it to \nits own advantage. It devised sophisticated, complex and exhaustive \nrecruitment procedures designed, inter alia, to exclude trades union activists \nor people with experience of union organisation (Garrahan and Stewart, \n1992)21. Within the region, trades unions competed vigorously for the right to \nbe the sole union at the new plant (Hudson, 1995a, 79-85). The \u2018winner\u2019 of the \ncontest was the AEEU. Its single union deal was seen as so ineffective by \nworkers that managers had to persuade workers to join the union in an \nattempt to maintain an image of partnership in a region where such imagery \nwas important22.  Elsewhere Honda secured a no-union deal rather than a one \n                                                          \n20 There was also controversy surrounding the actions of Derbyshire County council in \nattracting Toyota. \n21 Indeed, Nissan was actively courted by the Thatcher government as a way of showing \ncompanies in the UK how to re-shape labour relations and work practices. \n22 However, strong and active union organisation unexpectedly emerged amongst women \nemployed by some component suppliers located adjacent to the Nissan plant. This \nemphasises the importance of acknowledging the potential for the actions of organised labour \nto shape geographies of economies and influence trajectories of local economic development \n(see Herod, 2001; Hudson, 2001).  \n 14\nunion arrangement at its Swindon plant. In general, companies had little \ndifficulty in securing their preferred form of labour representation in their \nfactories.  \n \nIt was more problematic to secure provision of appropriate \u2019soft\u2019 infrastructure \nand training provision on in the surrounding regions beyond the factory \ngates23. For example, Nissan\u2019s requirements for suitably qualified labour-\npower were initially met via a direct relationship with Sunderland City Training \nand Enterprise Council (TEC), with national government and EU funding. As \nNissan expanded the labour force in the early 1990s, however, it became \nincreasingly concerned as to the efficacy of these arrangements. It decided \nthat a more broadly-based and quasi-autonomous organisation, externally-\nfunded, was required to underwrite the labour-power requirements of the \nautomobile industry in the region\u2019s component suppliers as well as Nissan \nitself, thereby minimising labour poaching between firms. The end product of \nthis was the creation of the Automotive Sector Strategic Alliance (ASSA), \nestablished in 199724. ASSA seeks \u201cto support the growth and \ncompetitiveness of the [auto] sector through the development of a skilled \nlabour force, helping create job security\u201d (cited in Pike et al, 2000, 79). In \nparticular, it aims to \u201ccascade\u201d a \u201ctraining culture\u201d down the tiers of the supply \nchain from Nissan and both encourage and support SMEs collectively to \ninvest in training. As ASSA became more established as an institution of \nregional labour market governance and regulation, Nissan was able to step \nback, confident that the new organisation would ensure that many of its \ntraining requirements were met, without it seeming to favour Nissan or without \nNissan seeming to lobby for special treatment. At the same time, however, \nboth Nissan\u2019s by-now well-established presence and ASSA\u2019s existence \nbecame deployed in marketing the region, seeking to create an image of the \nnorth east as an automotive region, and attract future investment, in \nparticular, more design-oriented and knowledge-intensive projects (Hudson, \n2000, 75). \n \nThe increasing presence of Japanese producers posed a growing challenge \nto established automobile producers in western Europe, both \u2018national \nchampions\u2019 (such as Fiat and Renault) and USA-based multinationals with a \nlong history of production in Europe (notably Ford and GM ). Their response \nwas to seek out peripheral locations within Europe in which to establish new \nfactories that emulated those of the Japanese producers, such as that at \nMelfi. Melfi was established by FIAT on a \u2018green-field\u2019 site in the Mezzogiorno \nto allow a completely new (to Italy) form of work organisation to be introduced, \nunderpinned by substantial financial support from the Italian state (Conti and \nEnrietti, 1995). While Melfi was established to produce high volume cars at \nthe lower end of the market (notably the Punto), such peripheral plants often \n                                                          \n23 In Pecks\u2019 (19960 terms in the workplace rather than the work place. \n24 ASSA\u2019s membership comprises Nissan and over 40 suppliers within the north east, with \nBoard member representation from Nissan, local authorities, TECs, further and higher \neducational organisations, the Northern Development company (subsequently absorbed into \nthe new Regional Development Agency, ONE North East in 1999), and Sunderland Business \nLink.  \n \n 15\nhad another role. Often they were to produce relatively low volumes of \nexisting or new products, such as off-road vehicles and \u2018people carriers\u2019 \n(Ferrao and Vale, 1995), as companies experimented with new products and \nnew ways of producing in plants that were not central to their on-going \nproduction strategies.  In part this was because attempts to introduce new \nHVFP methods into their existing plants initially encountered strong resistance \nfrom workers and trades unions. In due course, however, as lessons were \nlearned from experimental plants in peripheral locations and workers began to \naccept that there seemed little choice but to accept radical changes in working \npractices if capacity and some jobs were to be preserved in existing plants, \n\u2018lean\u2019 production methods became introduced into major plants in core \nlocations: early examples included BMW at Regensburg, VW at Embden and \nCitroen\/PSA at Rennes  (Hudson and Schamp, 1995).  \n \nThe opening up of CEE offered new spaces in which to re-locate high-volume \nproduction of low value models, produce new products in relatively small \nvolumes, and  experiment with new ways of producing  and working \n(\u2018experimenting-with-the-future\u2019 approaches: Grabher, 1997, 127-9) in regions \ncharacterised by high unemployment and the widespread availability of labour \nof varied types. A series of inward investments in automobile assembly plants \nfollowed, both new \u2018green field\u2019 factories (mainly in Hungary, the former GDR \nand Poland) and joint ventures or acquisitions of existing automobile \nproducers. Examples of the former include VW at Mosel, and GM Opel at \nEisenhach, both in the former GDR, GM Opel in Gliwice in south west Poland, \nwhile planned new factories include BMW and Porsche at Liepzig in the \nformer GDR, and a joint venture by Peugeot and Toyota in a new factory at \nKolin in the Czech Republic. Examples of \u2018brown field\u2019 investments via \nacquisition include Fiat\u2019s acquisition of FSM, which became Fiat Poland SA, \nDaewoo-FSO in Poland, VW\u2019s acquisition of Skoda (in the face of competition \nfrom Renault), Suzuki\u2019s Hungarian joint venture at Estergom (Swain, 1996; \n1998), Daewoo\u2019s acquisition of Ukrainian Avtozaz and Renault\u2019s purchase of \nDacia in Rumania25.  \n \nSuch investments were both path-dependent and path-forming: Nielsen et al., \n1995).  In all cases companies were able to exercise great selectivity in \nrecruitment, with rigorous practices reminiscent of those used by Japanese \ncompanies in the UK, and hire workers for a fraction of western Europe \nwages. By introducing new ways of working and control of the labour process \nvia the activities of foremen and more assertive managerial practices, \nremoving the autonomy that shop floor workers had enjoyed during the state \nsocialist era (Burawoy and Krotov, 1993),  \u2018the frontier of control\u2019 (Beynon, \n1973) has been re-defined in automobile assembly and component factories \nin CEE. In cases in which the equipment and means of production were \n                                                          \n25  An indication of the extent to which inward investment rapidly came to dominate \nautomobile production in much of CEE is that foreign-owned companies and joint ventures \n(including components production) accounted for 85% of automobile production in Hungary, \n82% in Poland and 67% in the Czech Republic (Zemplinerov\u00e1, (1998, 337). The major inward \ninvesting companies in 1999, in rank order, were VW, Fiat, Daewoo and Renault \u2013 the \nsubsequent bankruptcy of Daewoo was a sharp reminder of the dangers involved for host \nterritories in CEE. \n 16\nrelatively modern (as with VW\u2019s acquisition of Skoda) great increases in \nproductivity were initially gained without major capital investment. In some \ncases, typically those associated with \u2018brown field\u2019 acquisition of existing \nautomobile plants, companies recruited workers endowed with engineering \nskills and\/or experience of working in the automobile industry but amenable to \nthe introduction of new working practices. In other cases of new \u2018green field\u2019 \nplants, companies recruited \u2018green\u2019 labour with no previous experience of \nworking in the automobile industry (as at Magyar Suzuki: see Swain, 1998).  \n \nNational governments in CEE have actively sought to attract FDI in the \nautomobile industry, further ratcheting up the level of territorial competition for \nsuch investments. Fixed capital investment costs have been subsidised by \ngenerous national state and\/or EU financial support via regional policy grants \nand loans, and often in locations with attractive exchange rates in terms of \nexports to the west (Hudson and Schamp, 1995; Pavl\u00ednek and Smith, 1998; \nSmith and Feren\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1, 1998)26. Often new industrial areas were prepared \nspecifically to attract such investment, further reducing production costs there \nfor inward investors via tax allowances: for example the Polish government \nestablsihed special economic zones (SEZs - although such incentives are \nillegal under the terms of the EU accession agreements).  Such subsidisation \nby national governments and\/or the EU reduces the risks to companies and \nlowers sunk cost barriers to exit, for whatever reason. Within a broad EU \nregulatory framework, local and national states and organised labour have \nbeen active agents in \u2018capturing\u2019 mobile investments, with the aim of (re-) \nsituating local economies within a Europeanised production system. Such \nactions, however, help define and enhance the territorial competition involved \nin regional and local development in contemporary Europe, as the attempt to \n\u2018ground\u2019 investments in any one local economy necessarily involves pitting it \nin competition with other regions across Europe. Such territorial competition is \nfurther complicated by the use of national state aids to keep production \nfacilities in EU Member States in the face of relocation pressures to lower cost \nregions in, inter alia, CEE.27 \n \n                                                          \n26 In the longer term eastern Europe offered the promise of market expansion but in the short \n\u2013 term the attractions of producing there \u2013 notably low cost labour \u2013 militated against any \nsignificant market growth based on rising levels of material consumption there.  \n27 Examples include the UK government\u2019s subsidies to Nissan and Rover, the Italian \ngovernment\u2019s subsidy of Euros 40 million to FIAT for developing a new model at Melfi, and \nthe Free State of Saxony\u2019s subsidy of Euros 100 million to VW for the Mosel and Chemnitz \n(former Trabant) works. Eastern Germany is a particularly sensitive location. Article 92(2)(c) \nof the EC Treaty authorises \u201caid granted to the economy of certain areas of the Federal \nRepublic of Germany affected by the division of Germany, in so far as such aid is required in \norder to compensate for the economic disadvantages caused by that division'\u201d Justification of \naid requires a cost-benefit analysis in which the site is compared with another location in the \nEU but increasingly national governments use CEE as the comparator. The political \nsensitivities associated with such national government aid, and tensions between the EU and \nnational levels, were recently emphasised by German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. \nSpeaking at the opening of VW\u2019s new Dresden factory, he attacked EU attempts to limit \nnational states\u2019 capabilities to offer selective assistance to secure such investments to \ndepressed regions, such as those of eastern Germany, stressing that this was central to the \nnational states economic responsibilities (Simonian, 2001). \n 17\nThese plants in CEE have in turn helped re-define \u2018best practices\u2019 and \nproductivity norms in automobile plants in western Europe. As the fin de si\u00e8cle \napproached, the principles of \u2018lean\u2019 production were incorporated in varying \ndegrees, albeit in hybridised forms as these were adapted to local \ncircumstances, into all major automobile assembly plants in Europe, with the \neffects cascading down supply chains to become incorporated into first tier \nsuppliers and other companies located further down supply chains. \nFurthermore, as well as leading to new links between plants within companies \nacross Europe in emergent Europeanised production systems (themselves \noften part of global systems), the new HVFP methods required new forms of \nrelations between firms. Increasingly major assembly companies sought to \nfocus upon design, R&D, marketing and final assembly, and out-source \ncomponent production, increasingly seeking links with first tier component \nsuppliers that would provide modules and sub-assemblies rather than \nindividual components. This, coupled with an emphasis on JIT delivery, and \nengineering in quality from the outset, re-defined the anatomy of the \ncomponent sector within Europe.  \n \nThe increasingly stringent requirements of assembly companies helped \ntrigger a surge in acquisitions and mergers and product and portfolio swaps \nwithin the components sector, as first tier suppliers either emerged, merged or \nconsolidated their positions around particular sections of the product market \n(Dicken et al, 1995, 17; Sadler and Amin, 1995). These changes in the \ncorporate anatomy of the supply chain and the switch towards JIT production \nalso led to changes in production geographies. Sometimes JIT involved \nproduction in one place and a re-regionalisation of production. For example, \nsupplier parks were established adjacent to Nissan\u2019s Sunderland factory,  to \nthe Ford\/VW joint venture to produce people carriers at Setubal in Portugal \n(Ferrao and Vale, 1995) and to the SEAT factory at Matorell, near Barcelona. \nSuch examples lend support to claims about a transition from former \u2018global \noutpost\u2019 forms of branch plant investment to embedded performance plants \n(Hudson, 1995b)28.  \n \nOften, however, such spatial clustering was simply a necessary response to \ninadequate transport infrastructures and logistics systems. Referring to the \nsupplier park established adjacent to the Fiat plant at Melfi, Mehl (cited in \nHudson and Schamp, 1995, 227) notes29, with a degree of irony, that  \u201cthe \n                                                          \n28 Equally, well-grounded fears about dis-articulated branch plant economies and of \ndependency, external control, and profit repatriation remain. Commenting, unusually) publicly, \nin the aftermath of the collapse of Daewoo in 2000 and its subsequent impacts on the \nindebted Daewoo-FSO car plant near Warsaw, Marek Belka, Poland\u2019s Finance Minister and \nDeputy Prime Minister. stressed: \u201cWe know that this debt comes from the fact that the \ncompany raised the prices of its supplies and lowered the prices of goods sold abroad or to \nthe Daewoo chain\u201d. More generally he added: \u201cif we see a company that\u2019s increasing its \nproduction and sales \u2026 while regularly reporting losses, it will have to reckon with an audit\u201d \n(cited in Reed, 2001). This suggests that the continuing existence of processes of transfer of \nvalue both between locations within Europe and from Europe to other places within the overall \nautomobile value chain.  \n29 Subsequently there have been considerable improvements in road transport links in \nparticular, facilitating both extended commuting to the factory and facilitating component \ndelivery from other parts of Italy, but the clustering of suppliers around the assembly plant \nremains (Interviews at Melfi with Fiat managers, July 2001). \n 18\naspired close spatial relationship with suppliers can be seen as a tribute to \nparticular Italian circumstances: strikes in the transport sector, bad road and \nrail linkages [that] make more difficult the production-synchronous delivery \nfrom larger distances\u201d. In other circumstances, co-location of suppliers and \nassemblers without the provision of a specific supplier park, represents a type \nof \u2018pseudo-JIT\u2019 to cope with the problems of poor transport and \ncommunications infrastructure rather than synchronous production (Hudson, \n2000, 156-8). Suppliers establish warehouses from which the assembly plants \ncan be supplied \u2018JIT\u2019 from buffer stocks.  Examples of this type of pseudo-JIT \nvia co-location include the GM and VW assembly plants at Eisenach and \nMosel , respectively (Schamp, 1995).  \n \nMore generally, there has been investment in CEE by western European \ncomponent producers in response to assemblers locating there. For example, \nfollowing VW\u2019s acquisition of Skoda, several suppliers (including ITT, Bosch, \nT&N, Rockwell-Golde, VDO and Lucas) followed it there via a series of \nacquisitions and joint ventures. These moves reflected two considerations \n(Hudson and Schamp, 1995). First, to secure access to the market for \nSkoda\u2019s component supplies; secondly, the attractions of the combination of \nlow wages, skilled labour and relatively high productivity, allied to favourable \nexchange rates. More generally, automobile producers established in core \nlocations in Europe, but shifting some production to peripheral locations, \nprefer maintaining links with and sourcing from existing suppliers via the latter \nestablishing new, typically \u2018green field\u2019, component plants (Hudson and \nSchamp, 1995). In addition, the need to meet \u2018local content\u2019 criteria in \napplicant countries in CEE has sometimes led to the incorporation of \nindigenous component production via joint ventures with foreign assembly \ncompanies. For example, Daewoo established 15 Polish-South Korean joint \nventures in component production in Poland to ensure that it met the \nminimum target of 60% \u2018local\u2019 (EU) content (Havas, 2000, 252).  \n \nEchoing the impacts of earlier rounds of Japanese investment on the supply \nchain in northern Europe, inward investments in the component sector in CEE \nhave helped transform the complex web of supply networks there. However, \nthe power of companies such as VW and GM-Opel has led to the emergence \nof sharp asymmetries of power within reconstituted supply chains. Some \ndomestic component producers have been integrated into newly established \nsupply networks, For example, many Czech firms have become \u2018first tier\u2019 \nsuppliers for the new investments by VW30. More commonly, however, local \nproducers incorporated into these networks generally manufacture less \ncomplex and lower value components, with \u2018high tech\u2019 and high value \ncomponents imported (for example, Magyar Suzuki imports such components \nfrom Japan).  Furthermore, as in parts of western Europe, such as Spain, \nmany other \u2018local\u2019 producers have been excluded because of component \ninvestment from the EU. Consequently, many well-established plants have \nbeen excluded from these supply networks, with important implications for \ntheir sustainability and for regional development, as the degree to which the \n                                                          \n30 There are marked similarities between VW\u2019s component supply policies and those \nJapanese assemblers in western Europe, which prefer to source from into existing but \nappropriately-restructured supply chains (Hudson, 1995a, 73-6). \n 19\nnewly-(re)constructed automobile production systems are \u2018embedded\u2019 in \nthese regions varies sharply31. In eastern as in western Europe, there is a \nrange from export-oriented branch plants that are clearly \u2018global outposts\u2019 to \nregional production systems that involve closer links between assemblers and \ntheir suppliers in more \u2018embedded\u2019 sophisticated \u2018enclave\u2019 economies \n(Hudson, 2002).  In the latter cases, however, exclusion from or inclusion in \nthese supply networks is determined by the requirements of multi-national \nauto producers, driven by corporate interests rather than those of regional \ndevelopment. \n \nEqually, however, production systems were often constructed on a pan-\nEuropean basis (not least because EU \u2018local content\u2019 rules relate to the EU \nrather than any specific region in it), offering different possibilities for inward \ninvestment as a source of regional development. For example, Bosch\u2019s \nalternator plant at Miskin, near Cardiff, is one of only two plants that supply \nthe entire global market with particular types of alternator (Sadler and Amin, \n1995, 48-50), VW supplies its assembly plant in Bratislava in Slovakia with \ncomponents from suppliers in Germany via train on a daily basis, while metal \nstamped parts are delivered from Opel\u2019s plant in Zaragoza to that in Eisenach \nby train (Schamp, 1995). Subject to appropriate logistics arrangements, \ntherefore, \u201cdeadline proximity\u201d (Ferrao and Vale, 1995) and producing JIT \ndoes not necessarily require co-located production. \n \nThere is, however, a further twist in the tale (and tail) to processes of \nEuropeanisation. Despite over-capacity and problems of profitability, there \nhas been great resistance to acquisitions and mergers between European \nproducers \u2013 automobiles has often been a sector of \u2018national champions\u2019 with \nconsiderable resistance to cross-EU border merger and acquisition (Hudson \nand Schamp, 1995). The failure of the strategic alliance and proposed merger \nbetween Renault and Volvo in the early 1990s exemplified the difficulties of \ncross-national mergers in the EU (Malmberg, 1995, 186-8; Savary, 1995, 163-\n7). However, in the 1990s Japanese producers became increasingly crisis-\nprone because of stagnating domestic demand and slowing growth of exports. \nThis led to strategic alliances and other links between Japanese and non-\nJapanese producers \u2013 and the increasing dominance of the pursuit of share-\nholder value rather than stakeholder interests, expressed in internal labour \nmarket of companies in the notion of \u2018jobs for life\u2019. One such link up of \nparticular significance in Europe was the strategic alliance forged in 1999 \nbetween Renault and Nissan. Renault took a major stake (38.6%, alter \nincreased to 44.4%) in the share capital of Nissan, as part of a still-evolving \nstrategic alliance intended to solve Nissan\u2019s deeply rooted profitability crisis \n(Burt, 2001). Although in principle a strategic alliance, in practice Renault \nbecame the dominant partner. \n \nThis link-up led to competition between the companies for investment to \nproduce the new generation of Nissan Micra. Despite claims that the former \nwas by some distance the most productive - in terms of vehicles per worker \u2013 \n                                                          \n31 In referring to \u2018embeddedness\u2019 here, I am aware that this relates only to the character of \nlinkages in the supply chain and that this is at best one dimension of the more complex \nprocesses of \u2018embedding\u2019. \n 20\nplant in Europe (Hudson, 2000, 147), it is located outside the Euro-zone. This \nled, early in 2001, to a growing belief that Nissan was giving serious \nconsideration to shifting future production of the Micra to a Renault plant in \nFrance (probably Flins, on the outskirts of Paris). This would have lead to \nsignificant job loss both in the factory and in component supply plants in the \nnorth east and elsewhere in the UK. There were both economic (in terms of \ncosts) and political (in terms of demonstrating that the Renault-Nissan \nrelationship created jobs in France) attractions for Nissan in switching \nproduction to one of Renault\u2019s existing factories in France.  \n \nIn the end, Micra production remained at Sunderland, but on terms that were \nvery favourable to Nissan. It acquired a \u00a340 million grant from the UK \ngovernment, agreement by UK suppliers to price in Euros (thereby shifting the \nrisks of currency fluctuation to them) and, most significantly, agreement to 24 \nhour three shift working in the Sunderland plant, dramatically reducing the \nturnover time of fixed capital invested there. Simply the threat of re-\nconfiguring the geography of corporate production in the wake of the new \nstrategic alliance secured enhanced surplus-value production at Sunderland. \nAt the same time, Nissan made clear that it would enhance component \nsourcing from the Euro-zone, further intensifying the pressure on component \nsuppliers producing in the UK. In short, as a result of the perceived possibility \nof shifting Micra production from Sunderland, Nissan able to extract significant \nconcessions from its work-force and suppliers in the UK, with significant \neffects on the geography of the value chain.  Thus the new corporate anatomy \nof automobile production in Europe led to in-situ changes at Sunderland and \nalso to changes in the supply chain \u2013 and in turn again re-defined auto \nproduction productivity norms within Europe, with important implications for \nthe geography of the automobile production system and for regional \ndevelopment in Europe. \n \nSteel: the interaction of merger and acquisition, EU expansion and \nchanging regulatory regimes in re-defining anatomy of production  \n \nEven more so than automobiles, steel has been an industry of \u2018national \nchampions\u2019 in western Europe. Paradoxically, it can also be seen as an \nindustry of great symbolic significance in the context of the EU. The 1951 \nTreaty of Paris was specifically concerned to establish a cross-national \nregulatory regime for the coal and steel industries via the creation of the \nEuropean Coal and Steel Community32. While there was early pan-European \nregulation, however, this gave no encouragement to cross-national mergers. \nThere were several reasons for this. Firstly, steel was seen as central to \nnational armaments and defence industries. Secondly, in many national \nstates, steel was a public sector\/nationalised industry. Thirdly, steel was a key \ninput to a range of other manufacturing industries. While there was increasing \nacquisition and merger activity within national boundaries in Europe, \nespecially from the late 1970s, often involving selective product and portfolio \n                                                          \n32 The life of the Treaty of Paris was 50 years, so that it expires as the EU is on the verge of \nexpanding into CEE, with the restructuring of the Polish steel industry in particular presenting \na major challenge. \n 21\nswaps33, there was very little evidence of cross-border mergers. The most \npublicised cross-border merger \u2013between Hoesch and Hooghoven.to form \nEstel - collapsed in 1982  \u2013 but was notable for its rarity (Hudson, 1994)34. \n \nFor some three decades, steel has been an industry characterised by global \nover-capacity35, with periodic trade disputes, especially involving the USA, \noften with the EU. In this context, steel companies within western Europe \nexplored various ways of combating corporate crises of profitability, including \ndiversification out of steel (for example, into electronics, automobiles or \nfinancial services), product diversification and up-grading product quality. In \nmany areas of bulk steel production, however, the response to crisis was to \ncut capacity and jobs to increase levels of capacity utilisation and thereby \nreduce unit production costs. The scale of job losses has been very severe. \nBetween 1975 and 1995 employment in iron and steel in the EU fell by 65% \nfrom 991,000 to 326,0036. Given the historical geography of the industry, \nthese job losses were highly concentrated in particular regions and cities and \ntowns within them. This led to a series of often fiercely contested plant \nclosures and job losses (for example, see Hudson, 2000, 201-26. Many of \nthese steel producers were publicly-owned, which further politicised the \nprocesses of cutting capacity and jobs, especially as these cuts were \nincreasingly part of rationalisation processes designed to enable state-owned \nsteel companies to be privatised. For by the 1990s there were intensifying \npressures on state finances, and privatisation was seen as one way of helping \ncontain them. However, privatisation, the disciplines of the market and the \nneed to demonstrate share-holder value in turn further increased financial \npressures on steel producers in the EU.  \n \nWhile one initial response was further acquisition and mergers within national \nboundaries \u2013 notably in Italy following the privatisation of Finsider and the \nsubsequent merger and rationalisation activities of Ilva and Falck in the early \n1990s (Hudson, 1994) and in Germany as first Krupp and Hoesch merged \nand then Krupp\/Hoesch merged with Thyssen in 1999 to form the (then) third \nlargest steel company globally.  Such mergers were a prelude to further \nrounds of capacity and job cuts and portfolio rationalisation, but also to the \nnewly-merged companies seeking to expand beyond their home national \nterritories. For example, ThyssenKrupp concentrated all iron and steel \nproduction and most of its hot strip production at Duisburg, with consequent \ncuts in employment and capacity in Dortmund (historically the centre of \nHoesch\u2019s operations). In addition, however, ThyssenKrupp embarked upon a \n                                                          \n33 For examples include the so-called Phoenix mergers in the UK in the 1980s and the merger \nand rationalisation activities involving Ilva and Falck in Italy in the early 1990s (Hudson, \n1994).  \n34 Often merger proposals faced strong political opposition. For example, in 1990 Arbed \n(Luxembourg) and Cockerill (Belgium) were forced to abandon plans to merge their flat \nproducts division in the face of strong political opposition in both countries.  \n35 In 1980 global over-capacity was estimated at 2000 million tonnes and by 2000 still stood at \n85 million tonnes: Ekkehard Schulz, Executive \/board Chairman, ThyssenKrupp (cited in \nBetts, 2002). \n36 In two of the current eastern European applicant states, Hungary and Poland, it fell , from \n222,000 to 106,000. The data were collected by the International Labour Organisation: see \nBolger, 1997). \n 22\nround of acquisition and divestment activities. Between 1999 and 2001 it \nacquired business with annual sales of 3.7 billion Euro and disposed of assets \nwith annual sales of 2.5 billion Euro as it sought to re-position its portfolio of \nactivities within and beyond steel and within and beyond Germany. For \nexample, its automotive division acquired several companies to reinforce its \nposition in the manufacture of vehicle bodies, engine development and \nelectrical and electronic assembly activities whilst it increasingly focussed its \nactivities within iron and steel on the production of both carbon and stainless \nsteel flat products for automobiles and \u201cwhite goods\u201d markets, including a \nmajor investment in \u201cthe world\u2019s most advanced stainless steel mill \u201c in China, \nwhich began production in 2001 with an annual capacity of 270,000 tonnes \n(Betts, 2002).  \n \nAs well as pressures to internationalise beyond Europe, there were also \nincreasing pressures for cross-border mergers within Europe to create \ncompanies that could better cope with international competition, further \nrationalise production and take advantage of the emerging single European \nmarket. One of the more prominent of these was the merger between British \nSteel and Hooghoven to form Corus. This was a prelude to post-merger \nrationalisation. Following earlier significant job cuts announced in 2000, in \n2001 Corus announced plans for a major rationalisation of production in the \nUK. These involved further big reductions in employment and capacity, \nespecially concentrated at Llanwern in south Wales and Teesside in north \neast England. This was a direct response to changes in the volume and \ncomposition of demand for steel in the UK, coupled with the appreciation of \nsterling against the Euro, making export to other EU markets unprofitable. It \nseems likely that in future Corus will seek to reduce its dependence on steel \n(for example, expanding aluminium production) and, within steel, move into \neastern Europe and continue to extend its operations beyond Europe37, with \nfurther reductions in capacity and employment in the UK. This is especially so \ngiven the merger between Usinor (France), Arbed (Luxembourg) and Aceralia \n(Spain) which will create Acelor, the third biggest steel producer globally, \nwhich has re-defined the corporate anatomy of steel production in Europe38.  \n \nPressures to re-define the corporate anatomy and geographies of steel \nproduction in Europe had been enhanced by events in 1989 and the \nsubsequent attempts to rationalise technically very inefficient steel production \nin CEE, especially as Poland became a serious candidate for EU entry. \nDespite marked reductions in employment  \u2013 from 156,00 in 1975, to 140,000 \nin 1989 and to 92,000 in1996 (Bolger, 1997) \u2013 labour productivity in steel \nproduction in Poland lagged behind that in western Europe. From within CEE, \nacquisition by western steel companies is seen as the route to transform the \nindustry. Following sporadic but inconclusive discussions with western \n                                                          \n37 For example, in January 2002 it announced a, alliance with Sumitomo to supply shet steel \nto the automobile sector (Hijino and Marsh, 2001) \n38 Automobile producers in the EU lobbied \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 against Acelor, on the grounds \nthat it would be in a position to raise sheet steel prices. These concerns were dismissed by \nthe EU Commission on the grounds that there was substantial over-capacity in steel and that \nthe major automobile companies possessed considerable purchasing power (Guerrera, \n2001). \n 23\ncompanies since the early 1990s, the Polish government became increasingly \nanxious to secure privatisation via this route, especially of the major plants of \nHiL at Nova Huta, near Kracow and Huta Katowice, as these account for \nsome 66% of total production capacity. For example, as Stenning (2000, 108) \nputs it, referring to HTS, the company that operates the HiL plant: \u201cIn May \n1997, HTS was converted to a state-run joint stock company since when it \nhas been actively seeking foreign investment\u201d.  In an attempt to secure \nprivatisation via acquisition by western European companies by 2001 \n(Wagstyl, 1998), capacity and employment were drastically further reduced, \nwhile at the same time undertaking fixed capital investment to modernise \ncapacity and improve productivity. For example, the HiL plant employed \n32,000 in 1989 but by 1999 this had been cut to 12,000, while investing over \n\u00a3200 million modernising the plant between 1995 and 1998. In January 2000 \nplans for a further 8,000 redundancies were announced.  \n \nEven so, as yet, attempts to persuade western steel companies to acquire the \nPolish plants have failed. While an Austro-Dutch consortium of Voest Alpine \nand Hooghoven agreed to acquire HTS in 1998, it subsequently (in 1999) \nstalled negotiations because of concerns over the future viability of the \ncompany. The merger between British Steel and Hooghoven further \ncomplicated the situation and the future of the HiL plant and HTS remains \nunclear. There is, however, some evidence of inward investment into CEE. \nFor example, in 2000 US Steel, the largest USA steel producer, announced it \nwas acquiring VSZ in Slovakia, the highest quality steel producer in CEE. This \nwas described as \u201cthe most significant foreign investment in Slovakia since \nVolkswagen in 1992 \u201c and as US Steel\u2019s \u201cfirst significant steel making \ninvestment for 13 years\u201d (Anderson and Bowe, 2000). This is indicative of a \nemerging tendency towards more globalised steel companies and of the \nlinkages between strategies of Europeanisation and globalisation in steel but \nwithin an European steel production system further reduced in scale39.    \n \nConclusions \n \nIn this paper, I sketched out a framework for understanding the geographies \nof economic and regional change in an increasingly integrated Europe. This \nfocuses upon production systems in three different industries, constituted via \nthe co-evolution of corporate strategies, the policies and regulatory \nframeworks of the EU and national states, and local and regional economic \ndevelopment and regeneration strategies. This has shaped the ways in which \ntheir geographies of have been re-worked in and beyond the boundaries of \nthe evolving new Europe, especially as a consequence of the continuing \nevolution of the EU. I have sought to explore how such organisations and \ninstitutions have sought to both shape and use spatial differentiation within \n                                                          \n39 Documents submitted to the EU by the Polish Government in 1998 envisage total \nemployment in steel in Poland falling further from 82,000 to 49,000 following EU entry, with \nthese cuts concentrated on Hil and Huta Katowice (Stenning, 2000). At an OECD meeting in \nDecember 2001, the EU offered to make capacity cuts of 13-16 mt by 2010, from a proposed \nglobal capacity reduction of 97mt. It is unclear as to whether this refers to the existing EU of \n15 so that any cuts in CEE applicants would be additional to these or whether it assumes \nPolish entry (Marsh and Alden, 2001).  \n 24\nEurope in pursuit of their various interests. Geographies of production \nsystems are seen as an outcome of the co-evolution of the relationships \nbetween these individual and collective actors and institutions. \n \nThe changing economic geographies discussed above can be interpreted \nboth as evidence of the declining importance of the regional scale and of the \ngrowing importance of that scale. The re-scaling of the European economy \nwould seem to be a complex process, not amenable to easy generalisation. \nWhile there is evidence of a tendency towards the creation of a Europeanised \nsystems of automobile, clothing and steel production, linking diverse locations \nwithin the continent, there are important differences in their geographies. \nEven so, as there is increasing qualitative differentiation in the technical and \nsocial divisions of labour within and across these systems, there is a general \ntendency for more sophisticated and higher-value added activities to locate in \n\u2018core\u2019 regions, with routine production dispersed to eastern and southern \nperipheries..  \n \nIn this context, regional development organisations of varied stripe are \nseeking to shape these evolving production systems to favour or protect \ninterest in \u2018their\u2019 territory. Some regions can certainly exert a powerful \ninfluence, as can some national states within Europe, in securing high value-\nadded and knowledge-intensive activities for \u2018their\u2019 territories. Others are in a \nmuch weaker and more vulnerable position, however. In terms of FDI, they \naccept what they can attract, which typically may not be their preferred \nchoice. In addition, many peripheral regions in north west Europe that were a \ntime the location of such routine activities increasingly are being squeezed \nfrom two directions. They are unable to compete with the eastern and \nsouthern peripheries on cost, and unable to compete for higher-value added \nactivities and functions with \u2018core\u2019 regions.  \n \nRegions are important political subjects in the intensifying inter-territorial \ncompetition within and beyond Europe. Whether this will help narrow or will \nreinforce regional inequalities in economic performance and well-being \nremains an open question, however. While there is evidence of past \nconvergence in regional economic performance in the EU between the 1960s \nand 1990s, this has largely been a result of convergence in broad sectoral \n(primary\/secondary\/tertiary) structures, with no evidence of intra-sectoral \nconvergence (Canaleta et al, 2002). While the eastward expansion of the EU \nwill re-create opportunities for further inter-sectoral convergence (CEC, 2001), \nthis will only be temporary as the broad structures of CEE economies \nconverge with those of the existing members of the Union. Furthermore, it is \nalready clear that evolving intra-sectoral and intra-industry spatial divisions of \nlabour are magnifying the qualitative differences between regions in relation to \neconomic performance and their positions within production systems. Such \ndifferences will increase as the combined effects of EU deepening and \nenlargement create greater opportunities for companies and for some regions \nsuccessfully to \u201cplay the games of \u2018scale politics\u2019\u201d while many more lose out in \nthis competition.  \n \nThe conclusion to be drawn from the simultaneous co-evolution of diverse \n 25\ntendencies in the spatial organisation of production systems, therefore, is that \nthe increasingly integrated New Europe will continue to be characterised by \nnew forms of combined and uneven development. As such, dramatic changes \nin economic organisation and specialisation and renewed divergence in the \nmap of regional economic performance and well-being can be expected. \nBecause of \u2013 rather than despite - processes of Europeanisation and \nglobalisation of production systems, and multi-scalar inter-territorial \ncompetition, there will continue to be great diversity in national and regional \neconomic organisation and performance in Europe. Understanding this \ndiversity is a central task for analysts of the changing nature of the \ngeographies of production systems and of regional economies in a still \nenlarging Europe. \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis paper arises in part from a research project funded by the UK Economic \nand Social Research Council on \u2018Regional economic performance, \ngovernance and cohesion in an enlarged Europe\u2019 under its One Europe or \nSeveral? Programme (grant number L213 25 2028). I am grateful to the \nESRC for this support and to my co-researchers on the project: Adrian Smith, \nAl Rainnie, Mick Dunford, David Sadler and Jane Hardy. I am also grateful to \nour research collaborators across Europe, especially Boleslav Domanski, \nVladimir Balaz, Lidia Greco, Daniel Kollar, Andrea Gonova, Alessandro \nMuscio and Giacchino Garofoli. It also draws on a previous project funded by \nESRC investigating the restructuring of the automobile industry in Europe \n(Grant number R000232516), research in Belgium, Germany, Greece and \nItaly in the 1980s and 1990s funded by the EU and the Anglo-German and \nNuffield Foundations, and work carried out as part of the European Science \nFoundation\u2019s RURE (Regional and Urban Restructuring in Europe) \nProgramme, 1992-6. A very preliminary version of the paper was presented, \njointly with David Sadler, to the 97th Annual Meeting of the Association of \nAmerican Geographers, 27 February \u2013 3 March, 2001, New York. I am \ngrateful for comments received there and to Joe Painter for his very helpful \ncomments on that paper.
