These\nstructures have developed through strong leader-\nship and a recommendation for local as well as\nnational research activity and research capacity\ndevelopment.1\nAs a result, the National Ambulance Research\nSteering Group was set up in 2007. It comprises\nresearch leads from the regional ambulance services\nin England and Wales as well as representatives\nfrom other key groups involved in prehospital\nresearch. The aim of the group is to support the\nstrategic development of ambulance and pre-\nhospital research and to seek active involvement,\nownership, participation and collaboration with\ntrust boards and executives and academic partners.\nThe national coordination and support for\nresearch has begun to enable sharing of best prac-\ntice, collaboration and coordination of effort to\nraise the profile of research in ambulance services.\nAs well as facilitating implementation of research\nfindings through improved access to knowledge, it\nhas also begun to measure and develop research\ncapacity in ambulance services and is seeking to\npromote academic institutions and groups as\nresearch partners, thereby promoting multicentre\nand even international studies.\nBACKGROUND\nThe national health research strategy Best Research\nfor Best Health,2 the evidence required to underpin\nthe transformation of emergency services as set out\nin Reforming Emergency Care3 and, more recently,\nTaking Health Care to the Patient4 have been key\npolicy drivers for ambulance services research.\nBest Research for Best Health seeks \u201cto improve the\nhealth and wealth of the nation through research\u201d.\nIf its mission \u201cto create a health research system in\nwhich the NHS supports outstanding individuals,\nworking in world-class facilities, conducting\nleading-edge research, focused on the needs of\npatients and the public\u201d is to succeed in the pre-\nhospital arena, this needs to support and be\nsupported by organisational structures for ambulance\nservices research.\nIn order for prehospital and ambulance research\nto flourish, these goals have been incorporated into\nthe new structures for nurturing research and\ndevelopment in the newly reconfigured ambulance\nservices in the UK.\nINTEGRATED STRUCTURES FOR PREHOSPITAL\nAND AMBULANCE RESEARCH\nPrehospital and ambulance research, whether in the\nUK or elsewhere, needs a coherent approach if it is\nto deliver a vision of patient-orientated world-class\nresearch. Ambulance trusts and clinicians will need\nto develop as users of, collaborators in and initiators\nof high-quality research to support a truly evidence-\nbased service. This requires a framework that\nencourages and supports a culture of evidence-\nbased practice, research and innovation, placing\nambulance services at the leading edge of patient-\nfocused service delivery. The current structures\nhave been designed to support interaction between\nknowledge management, quality improvement and\nresearch (figure 1).\nThe key structures are two national groupsdthe\nNational Ambulance Research Steering Group and\nthe National Ambulance Clinical Audit Steering\nGroup. Both groups have representation from\nresearch or audit leads from each of the regional\nambulance trusts as well membership from other\nkey stakeholders including Chief Executives and\nDirectors of Clinical Care of ambulance services.\nBoth groups report to the Directors of Clinical Care\nand therefore are informed by clinical priorities of\nservices as well as understanding the research or\n1East Midlands Ambulance\nService NHS Trust, Lincoln, UK\n2University of Lincoln, Lincoln,\nUK\n3London Ambulance Service\nNHS Trust, London, UK\nCorrespondence to\nProfessor A Niroshan\nSiriwardena, Faculty of Health,\nLife and Social Sciences,\nUniversity of Lincoln, Brayford\nPool, Lincoln LN6 7TS, UK;\nnsiriwardena@lincoln.ac.uk\nAll authors contributed to the\narticle.\nAccepted 8 July 2009\n324 Emerg Med J 2010;27:324e326. doi:10.1136\/emj.2009.072363\nPrehospital care\n group.bmj.com on April 12, 2010 - Published by emj.bmj.comDownloaded from \nquality improvement agenda. The National Ambulance Knowl-\nedge and Effectiveness Service, while not a separate group, does\nprovide a bimonthly clinical effectiveness update (the Emergency\nServices Current Awareness Update) which is circulated widely\nto front-line and other ambulances service personnel. Members of\nthe research group also have strong links with the UK Clinical\nResearch Network (UKCRN) and the Comprehensive Local\nResearch Networks (CLRNs), and this has led to new funding to\ndevelop the infrastructure in ambulance services for supporting\nresearch studies.\nThe National Ambulance Research Steering Group has sought\nto promote a sustainable infrastructure capable of identifying\nand responding to research needs in the short, medium and long\nterm. A number of existing and new national and international\nresearch groups have developed to positively support ambulance\nservices research. Collaborative research, including more than\none regional ambulance service linked to one or more university\ndepartments specialising in prehospital or primary care, has been\nestablished in London and Sheffield for many years and has\nbegun to flourish elsewheredfor example, in Swansea,\nManchester and Nottingham.\nOne of the earliest academic centres for prehospital research in\nthe UK, the Medical Care Research Unit of the University of\nSheffield, was established in 1966 and continues to play a signifi-\ncant role in emergency and urgent care research. The international\n999 EMS Research Forum was formed in 1999 to encourage,\npromote and disseminate research and evidence-based policy and\npractice in emergency health care. The Thematic Research\nnetwork for emergency and UnScheduled Treatment (TRUST),\nfunded by the Wales Office for Research and Development in\nHealth and Social Care (WORD), was the first nationally funded\nresearch network in emergency and urgent care.5 The British\nParamedic Association Research and Audit Committee was\nestablished to offer professional support and coordination and to\nfocus on developing research capacity in the emerging paramedic\nprofession. Other newer groups are also emerging.\nTrue collaboration will help to move ambulance services from\norganisations which have been traditionally seen as \u2018data rich,\ninformation poor \u2019 to bodies which themselves espouse and\nnurture a culture of research and innovation. It is also important\nthat opportunities are sought for collaborative multidisciplinary\nresearch which crosses the interface between primary, pre-\nhospital or acute settings.\nAs well as supporting the current national priority for trans-\nlational research, the strengthening of links between the triad of\nresearch, clinical audit (quality improvement) and knowledge\nmanagement has the potential to enable the more rapid dissemi-\nnation of evidence-based practice and the evaluation of new models\nof service delivery supported by effective knowledge transfer.\nThe new structures have also worked to ensure that effective\nresearch governance procedures are established and maintained.\nHealthcare organisations which lead or participate in research\nare required to have systems in place to ensure that the princi-\nples and requirements of research ethics and governance are\nconsistently applied and, in common with all NHS organisa-\ntions, ambulance trusts are required to be compliant with\nlegislation such as the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials)\nRegulation 2004 for clinical research trials and the research\nelements of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 before recruiting to\nrelevant studies.\nNATIONAL RESEARCH STRUCTURES\nThe NHS research strategy is driving the research agenda rapidly\nforwards in all health sectors. The key structures include the\nNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR), a virtual\n1\nHigher\nEducation\nInstitutions\nIndependent\nResearchers\nNational\nAmbulance\nResearch\nSteering\nGroup\nComprehensive Local \nResearch Networks \nResearch\nAmbulance Trust \nResearch Management \nand Governance\nUK Clinical \nResearch\nNetwork\nKey tasks for National Ambulance R&D Steering Group:\nSetting research strategy \nLaying down the agenda for prehospital research\nIncreasing capacity for research (funding, training, resources) \nDeveloping robust Research Management and Governance\nsystems \nFostering relationships with research networks, research\ndevelopment support units and others \nCollaborative\nPrehospital\nResearch Groups\nAmbulance services\nNIHR and other networks KEY\nAcademic\/independent\/other\nNational Institute \nfor Health \nResearch (NIHR)\nNIHR Funding streams, e.g. \nResearch for patient benefit (RfPB: regional responsive\nfunding)\nProgramme grants for applied research \nResearch for Innovation, Speculation and Creativity\n(RISC) Project Scheme \nHealth Technology Assessment (HTA) programme \nThe Service Delivery and Organisation (SDO)\nProgramme\nThe Invention for Innovation Research Programme\nThe Policy Research Programme\nThe Methodology Programme \nOther funding streams, e.g. \nResearch Councils \nCharities\nNIHR faculties, faculty members\nand schools \nNational\nAmbulance\nClinical Audit \nSteering\nGroup\nDirectors of \nClinical Care \nof Regional \nAmbulance\nServices\nNational\nAmbulance\nKnowledge & \nEffectiveness \nService\nEmergency\nServices \nCurrent\nAwareness\nUpdate\nNational\nElectronic\nLibrary for \nHealth\nResearch\nCouncils and \nCharities\nNational Research \nEthics Service \nTopic Specific \nNetworks \nSpecial Interest \nGroups and Local \nPriority Groups \nFigure 1 Framework for research and development for ambulance services.\nEmerg Med J 2010;27:324e326. doi:10.1136\/emj.2009.072363 325\nPrehospital care\n group.bmj.com on April 12, 2010 - Published by emj.bmj.comDownloaded from \ninstitute which supports clinical researchers in the NHS, the\nresearch networks which will support high quality clinical\nresearch and research management and governance, and the new\nand existing funding systems for NHS-funded research.\nAmbulance services have been included in configurations for\nCLRNs, which are administering the new \u2018bureaucracy busting\u2019\nprocesses for research governance as well as providing funding for\nservice support costs to support additional health service costs of\nparticipating in clinical research. Ambulance trusts still need to\nhave arrangementsdeither alone or in partnership with other\nhealthcare organisationsdto administer governance arrange-\nments for \u2018own account\u2019 and student research projects which will\nnot be adopted by the CLRNs.\nThe CLRNs together with the six Topic Specific Research\nNetworks (TCRNs) and a Primary Care Research Network\n(PCRN) make up the NIHR Clinical Research Network (CRN)\nin England. This is part of the UKCRN which aims to provide\na world-class NHS infrastructure for clinical research, supporting\nstudies adopted by the network and ensuring rigorous gover-\nnance. The CRN will extend to all aspects of health care\nincluding ambulance services, so it is important that ambulance\nservices are represented and active in these networks. More\nrecently, the CRN has set up special interest groups including\na group for injuries and accidents as well as local priority groups\nin this theme linked to CLRNs.\nThe UKCRN will support adopted studies funded by the\nNIHR and the research (funding) councils such as the Medical\nResearch Council and Economic and Social Research Council as\nwell as some health research charities. The research funding\norganisations, along with the Department of Health, will be\namong those responsible for determining research priorities\nbased on stakeholder and other views.6 Ambulance services will\nneed to compete for national and international funding in part-\nnership with other healthcare organisations and higher education\ninstitutions. However, the UKCRN and the NIHR will not be\na panacea for previous shortcomings in prehospital research or\nresearch funding to ambulance services, and strong collabora-\ntions between ambulance services and academic departments\nwill be needed to address these deficiencies.\nThere are an increasing number of examples of collaboration\nbetween academic departments and ambulance services in high\npriority topics such as developing measures linked to patient\nbenefit, providing safe pathways of care not involving transport\nto hospital, and increasing evidence-based clinical care delivered\nin the prehospital environment.6 Examples of these include\nnational studies on emergency care practitioners (http:\/\/www.\nshef.ac.uk\/scharr\/sections\/hsr\/emergency\/ecp.html), paramedic\nmanagement of falls (http:\/\/www.controlled-trials.com\/isrctn\/\npf\/60481756), clinical performance indicators7 and studies with\nindustry to determine the benefits of prehospital thrombolysis\nversus primary percutaneous coronary interventions (http:\/\/\nwww.presseportal.de\/pm\/6631\/1043644\/boehringer_ingelheim).\nThe new research structures, by ensuring that ambulance\nservices and academic departments meet regularly together to\ndiscuss potential new research studies, have and will continue to\nfacilitate partnerships for large-scale research and quality\nimprovement projects between one or more academic\ndepartments and regional ambulance services, thus ensuring\nsufficiently powered studies across representative populations\nproviding generalisable and relevant research outputs.\nDEVELOPING FUTURE CAPACITY\nResearch capacity building, the \u201cprocess of individual and insti-\ntutional development which leads to higher levels of skills and\ngreater ability to perform useful research\u201d,8 will be a key factor in\nproducing a sound research culture for ambulance services.6\nThe National Ambulance Research Steering Group is under-\ntaking a research capacity development audit across most of the\nUK ambulance services in partnership with Trent and South\nYorkshire Research Design Services using a previously developed\nframework.9 Organisational support for research, collaboration\nwith academic departments and the development of expertise in\naccessing funding are some of the critical elements required for\nthis. Research on current priorities6 and novel studies, proposed\nby ambulance services and staff in line with their strategic aims,\nwill enable a research culture to develop talented researchers,\nresources for individual studies and future programmes of\nprehospital research in collaboration with academic departments.\nCONCLUSION\nThis short paper describes how new structures have been put in\nplace to support the strategic development of ambulance and\nprehospital research. This will help address gaps in the evidence\nfor health interventions as well as service delivery in the rapidly\nchanging environment of prehospital and ambulance care. We\nbelieve that this framework for research will develop to support\nclinicians in providing the best care to their patients, managers\nto implement the systems for this to occur and commissioners\nto procure the highest quality services based on the best avail-\nable evidence. Ambulance services will aspire to be taken seri-\nously as research active and capable organisations.\nAcknowledgements The authors acknowledge the support of members of the\nNational Ambulance Research Steering Group.\nFunding Department of Health.\nCompeting interests None.\nProvenance and peer review Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.\nREFERENCES\n1.
