Not only, it is supposed, does IR have a distinct point of origin vis-\u00e0-\nvis other social sciences, nor is there any body of what we could recognisably call international \ntheory before the early twentieth century, whether we search for this in the sands of political \ntheory (Wight 1966) or social theory (Rosenberg 2006). Although there are now a number of \ncompeting explanations of IR\u2019s origins (e.g. Ashworth 1999; Schmidt 2002; Vitalis 2005; Long \nand Schmidt eds 2005), these accounts converge around one common point of departure: that the \nprincipal institutionalisation of the discipline took place during the first half of the twentieth \ncentury. As such, there is general agreement that IR lacks comparable origins to other social \nsciences. Unlike sociology, economics and political science (often considered to be the master-\ndisciplines of the social sciences), IR was not established during the eighteenth and nineteenth \ncenturies as attempts to understand the effect of modernity upon European societies, that is to say \nthe range of processes extending from the emergence of industrial capitalism to the rise of the \nbureaucratic state and the development of novel techniques of mass warfare. Nor was IR \nestablished in order to interrogate the \u201cdark side of modernity\u201d \u2013 the multiple changes wreaked \nupon non-European societies by the midwives to European exceptionalism: slavery, colonialism \nand imperialism. And the consequences of IR\u2019s discrete point of departure are significant. \nIndeed, compared to other major social sciences, IR has often appeared as an ugly duckling, less \na coherent body of thought than a hotchpotch of statecraft, diplomacy, history and law. Perhaps it \nis little surprise to see relatively few stand-alone departments of International Relations in the \nworld. When we ask what should be a simple enough question, \u2018What is International \nRelations?\u2019, it is surprisingly difficult to come up with a clear-cut answer. Rather, IR appears as \na kind of disciplinary Polo mint \u2013 an enterprise without a centre.  \n \nOf course, all disciplines have blind spots; all have genealogies which are revealing as much for \nwhat they leave out as for what they include (Smith 1995). Nevertheless, the infusion of IR with \ntwo foundational dates \u2013 1919, taken to be the first steps towards the institutionalisation of the \ndiscipline; and 1648, the Treaties of Westphalia and Munster which ended the wars of religion in \nEurope \u2013 envelop the discipline in a double bind which occludes investigation of the multiple \nforms of international system that have existed across time and space (Buzan and Little 2000), \n \n2 \nand the important ways in which societies, polities and economies have inter-related in driving \nprocesses of historical development (Hobson 2004; Matin 2007; Hall and Jackson eds 2008). \nMainstream IR scholarship has, for the most part, omitted the world beyond Europe (Reeves \n2007; Shilliam ed forthcoming), the world beyond men (Enloe 1989) and, quite frequently, the \nworld beyond high politics (Hobson and Seabrooke eds 2007). Indeed, for much of its existence, \nIR has had relatively little to say about perhaps the most fundamental international process of all \n\u2013 the world market (Strange 1988). All in all, this is what we might call an iceberg approach to \nIR, concentrating on 10% of the surface while missing 90% of the action which lies beneath \n(T\u00e9trault and Lipshutz 2005). The result is an impoverished discipline, necessarily restricted by \nthe limits of its purview.  \n \nSuch a lament is hardly novel (e.g. Buzan and Little 2001) and there is little doubt that an \nincreasing range of IR scholarship is aware of the poverty of its core subject matter. One of the \nprincipal ways in which IR scholarship has sought to makes it subject matter more robust is \nthrough concerted engagement with concepts, issues and debates drawn from cognate \ndisciplines. This forum contributes to this process of (potentially fruitful) interaction by \ninterrogating the relationship between IR and a discipline whose influence on IR has often been \nmore hidden than openly declared \u2013 Sociology. Although one of our arguments is that \nsociological concepts have had a more substantial impact on IR than is often acknowledged, \nthere is little doubt that the relationship between Sociology and IR \u2013 and the influence of the \nformer on the latter \u2013 has become stronger in recent years, partly because of the emergence of \nsocial constructivism and critical theory in IR, partly because of a shared conceptual interest in \nnotions of power, action and causation, and partly because of a certain fusion of empirical \nconcerns ranging from how the modern world came into being to assessing the relative novelty \nof the present historical conjuncture. This forum examines both the explicit and implicit \ninfluences, and the long-term and short-term impact, of Sociology on IR. Our aim is simple: to \ndemonstrate the ways in which Sociology \u2013 both as a practical field of enquiry and as a range of \ntheoretical approaches \u2013 can add value to IR.  \n \nAlthough this task is a relatively familiar one, we set about it in a novel way. Rather than asking \nIR scholars how they employ sociological techniques and tool-kits, the forum explores the ways \n \n3 \nin which three sociologists working on sites of obvious theoretical exchange (classical theory, \nhistorical sociology, Foucauldian analysis) approach some of IR\u2019s central concerns: whether IR \nconstitutes a discrete field of enquiry; the possibility of imagining a non-Eurocentric IR; and the \nways in which the international political economy is governed. Contributors have been asked, \nand in our view have admirably succeeded, to deliver a double punch, at once both theoretical \nand empirical, which can contribute to the deepening of IR as an intellectual field of enquiry. In \nthe Introduction to the forum, we contextualise these contributions by exploring the many \nlegacies \u2013 and prospects \u2013 of sociological thinking in IR. We begin by examining the ways in \nwhich Sociology has influenced mainstream IR and, in particular, structural realism (implicitly) \nand constructivism (explicitly). We move on to outline key spheres of the \u201csocial\u201d international, \nexploring several problematiques which act as contact zones between the two disciplines, most \nnotably anarchy\/solidarity, instrumental-rational governance, and historical sociologies of \nmodernity. In the final section of the Introduction, we return to the main concern which lies \nbehind this forum \u2013 the role of interdisciplinary in academic research and, in particular, the \nprospects and challenges of continued conversations between IR scholars and sociologists.  \n \nLegacies \nSociology plays a role in the social sciences as the discipline associated with study of the \nparticular form and content of modern society, seen as emerging from the \u201cdual revolutions\u201d that \ntook place in Europe at the end of the eighteenth century \u2013 an industrial (\u201ceconomic\u201d) revolution \nin England and a democratic (\u201cpolitical\u201d) revolution in France (Nisbet 1967, ch. 2; Elias 1978). \nThe institutionalisation of Sociology along the lines of what Auguste Comte called a \u201cscience of \nthe social\u201d was made in direct response to the tumult of these dual revolutions. Walter Benjamin \n(1999, 249) put the vocation of Sociology starkly \u2013 like the angel of history, Benjamin wrote, \nsociologists should concern themselves with \u201csearching for order in the broken fragments of \nmodernity\u201d.  Interestingly enough, although Martin Wight (1966) famously argued that there was \nno possibility of generating an international theory which stood as independent from study of the \n\u201cgood life\u201d afforded by the laws and norms of domestic societies, the canonical trinity of \nclassical sociological theory \u2013 Durkheim, Marx and Weber \u2013 did seek to unravel the social \ncontent of the modern condition, defining this in terms strikingly reminiscent of  the \u201coutside\u201d of \nthe good life, i.e. as anomie, alienation and disenchantment respectively. \n \n4 \n Although IR often claims an inheritance drawn principally from political theory, international \nlaw and international history, it could be argued that there is relatively little in the discipline \u2013 at \nleast in terms of IR theory \u2013 that stands outside from the influence of sociological approaches, \ntheories and concepts. For example, although Kenneth Waltz (1979, esp. ch. 6) famously raided \nmicro-economics in order to construct his theory of international politics, he also borrowed \nextensively \u2013 if inaccurately \u2013 from \u00c9mile Durkheim in generating his conceptualisation of \ninternational anarchy. Most notably, Waltz differentiated between domestic and international \norders by reference to Durkheim\u2019s distinction between mechanical and organic solidarity. The \ninternational realm, Waltz argued, is characterised by mechanical solidarity \u2013 the lack of \nfunctional differentiation required by complex society\u2019s means that like-units (states) can only \nstand in loose relation to others. In short, Waltz rendered anomie in the form of anarchy. For \nWaltz, the domestic realm, in contrast to international politics, is characterised by organic \nsolidarity, which Waltz understood to be a functionally differentiated space in which actors were \nbound together within an integrative, largely consensual, hierarchy.  \n \nA range of scholarship in IR has challenged Waltz\u2019s use of Durkheim. First, as many authors \nhave noted, Waltz effectively misplaces conditions of anomie in mechanical rather than organic \nsolidarity (Ruggie 1983; Larkins 1994; Barkdull 1995; Goddard and Nexon 2005). For \nDurkheim, traditional societies exhibit a mechanical form of solidarity in which individuals are \nbound to the \u201ccollective conscience\u201d directly, i.e. without forms of institutional mediation. In this \nunderstanding, individuals in pre-modern societies can effectively be seen as inorganic matter, \nhence Durkheim\u2019s use of the concept \u201cmechanical solidarity\u201d to describe the ways in which \nindividuals are bound together in simple social orders (1964, 130). For Durkheim, under \nconditions of modernity, processes such as industrialization induce a specialization of tasks \nwhich, in turn, produce a complex division of labour in which individuals are organised into \ndiscrete areas of work, family, education and so on (1964, 354-361). As experiences are \nincreasingly channelled through these intermediary roles, individuals come to understand their \nexistence as one of \u201canomie\u201d \u2013 a loss produced by the removal of the totalising norms, codes and \nstandards of conduct which defined pre-modern social orders (1964, 128, 361). Paradoxically, \nfor Durkheim, the complex division of labour in modern industrial society actually gains its \n \n5 \nstrength by encouraging the development of individual personalities. As such, because both the \nparts (individuals) and the whole (society) can be considered as \u201cliving\u201d, modern society can be \nsaid to exhibit a novel, \u201corganic\u201d form of solidarity (1964, 124-131). And in this way, Waltz \nmisreads Durkheim by seeing anomie as a feature of international (mechanical) life rather than, \nas Durkheim intended, as a product of domestic (organic) orders \u2013 a fairly pronounced error. \n \nLinked to this point is a second problem with Waltz\u2019s use of Durkheim. As some critics point out \n(e.g. Rosenberg 2010), by misplacing anomie in mechanical rather than organic social orders, \nWaltz undermines the sharpness of his distinction between domestic societies and the \ninternational realm. Indeed, where Durkheim applies the concepts \u201cmechanical\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d in \norder to indicate how progress takes place over time between simple and complex orders, Waltz \nuses the concepts to illustrate a static spatial distinction between domestic hierarchy and \ninternational anarchy. In this way, Waltz appears to hold two contradictory claims \nsimultaneously: first, following Durkheim, that there is a (potentially temporary) temporal \ndistinction between domestic and international orders based on complex forms of differentiation; \nand second, in his (mis)reading of Durkheim in the development of structural realism, that this \ndistinction is an eternal (spatial) point of demarcation between anarchical and hierarchical \norders. Seen in this light, structural realism can be said to contain an unsustainable \u2013 even \nincommensurable \u2013 sociological logic, albeit one which often appears as implicit rather than \nexplicit to its hardcore assumptions. \n \nThese two misappropriations of Durkheimian social theory by the doyen of structural realism \u2013 \nand it could be argued of mainstream IR theory in general \u2013 illustrate both the considerable \nimpact, and also the important challenges, in unravelling the relationship between IR and \nSociology. On the one hand, we see that even Waltzian structural realism \u2013 perhaps the most \ninfluential attempt to carve out a discrete space in which to theorise international relations \u2013 \ndepends heavily upon sociological attempts to define the exclusivity of the modern condition. On \nthe other hand, it is obvious that much of this interaction is problematic, employing sociological \ntheories and concepts somewhere between loosely and inaccurately.  \n \n \n6 \nIf the sociological foundations of structural realism represent one of IR\u2019s least productive \ninterdisciplinary engagements, this is less the case with constructivism, an approach which has \nborrowed promiscuously from Sociology. Alexander Wendt (1987, 1999), for example, deploys \na number of sociological approaches and traditions in order to set up his critique of structural \nrealism and, implicitly, of mainstream IR discourse tout court. Wendt ranges far and wide in his \nappropriation of prominent sociological traditions, variously employing: American symbolic \ninteractionism as practiced by figures such as George Herbert Mead (1981) and Erving Goffman \n(1959) (who, in turn, were influenced by the German interpretive sociological tradition known as \nVerstehen); the theory of structuration pioneered by the British sociologist Anthony Giddens \n(1984); and a sociology of knowledge exemplified in the work of Peter Berger and Thomas \nLuckmann (1967).  \n \nPerhaps most importantly, Wendt\u2019s version of social constructivism followed a path forged, in \nthe first instance, by the agent-structure debate which had previously taken place in Sociology, \nitself a product of European debates regarding the structuralist tendencies of dialectical \nmaterialism and American disillusionment with Parsonian structural-functionalism (Swingewood \n2000, 202; Bottomore 1984, 13). The agent-structure debate in IR may have been fed by pre-\nexisting questions within the philosophy of science (such as Roy Bhaskar\u2019s (1975) critical \nrealism; see also Keat and Urry 1975), but it was nourished primarily by extant sociological \nliteratures (Wendt 1995, p.76fn17; Dessler 1989, 452 fn45). Seeking to inject understanding of \nthe importance of social agency and change into previously static accounts of anarchy, Wendt \nperceived the international system as a realm in which states were both constrained by the \nrequirements of anarchy but also played their part in constituting it. For Wendt, it was possible to \nidentify three principal \u201ccultures of anarchy\u201d (Hobbesian, Lockean and Kantian) within which \ncertain social roles (enmity, rivalry and friendship respectively) served as the symbolic \ntechnologies by which states acted (Laffey and Weldes 1997). For Wendt, material capabilities \ncould not be understood without prior understanding of the social contexts within which these \nrelations were both embedded and interpreted. As such, one hundred nuclear weapons held by \nthe UK were less threatening to the United States than one held by North Korea. And in short, \n\u201canarchy is what states make of it\u201d (Wendt 1992).  \n  \n \n7 \nWendt was not the only instigator of constructivism who relied upon sociological approaches \nand traditions (see, for example, Onuf 1989). And since the appearance of Wendt\u2019s breakthrough \narticle, constructivists have filled in a research agenda which has now reached impressive \nproportions. Richard Price (2007) and Nina Tannenwald (2007) have studied the emergence of a \nnorm around the non-use of chemical and nuclear weapons respectively, taboos which serve as a \n\u201cstandard of civilization\u201d delineating appropriate behaviour in international politics. Similarly, \nMartha Finnemore (1996, 2003) has illustrated how the norm of humanitarian intervention has \nbeen constructed over time, starting with the protection of Christians from persecution by the \nOttoman Empire, and carried via the fight against slavery and decolonization into a universal \nconcept of humanity. Patrick Jackson (2007) has examined the re-imagining of the German state \nafter World War Two as a central node of Western civilization, thereby allowing material \nbenefits \u2013 membership of NATO, aid and more \u2013 to flow into the country. At the same time, \n\u201cthick constructivists\u201d, opposed to Wendt\u2019s immanent critique of mainstream IR, his state-\ncentrism and his \u201crump materialism\u201d have preferred to appropriate an understanding of \ninternational relations as \u201csocial all the way down\u201d (e.g. Kratochwil 2006, 2007).  \n \nThus, perhaps the most successful challenge to the 1980s and 1990s neo-neo synthesis in IR \u2013\nsocial constructivism \u2013 is heavily indebted to Sociology, particularly the various twists, turns and \npermutations of the agent-structure debate. And as such, constructivism represents the most \nobvious \u2013 and influential \u2013 example of the ways in which contemporary IR scholarship has \nborrowed from Sociology. Nevertheless, the relationship between Sociology and IR far exceeds \nthat which has taken place either explicitly within constructivist circles or implicitly between \nneo-realists and their critics. Indeed, both constructivism and structural realism are both way \nstations on a more extensive journey, one which includes the overt use by IR scholars of \nsociological classics (for example, Durkheim\u2019s notion of social solidarity or Weber\u2019s work on \nsubjectivity), associations mediated through other approaches\/disciplines (such as Michael \nMann\u2019s (1986) pioneering study of the sources of social power in world history), and the use of \nconcepts that, in their contemporary enunciations, have been previously developed by social \ntheorists (for example, \u201crationality\u201d, \u201csocial action\u201d and \u201cpower\u201d). Indeed, if the influence of \nSociology on IR is mapped in this way, it becomes obvious that the intellectual relationship \nbetween the two disciplines is multifaceted and complex rather than simple or singular.  \n \n8 \n The \u201csocial\u201d international  \nIf Waltz borrowed extensively \u2013 if incongruously \u2013 from Durkheim in his understanding of \ninternational anarchy, many critiques of structural realism in IR have relied just as heavily on \nsociological traditions, especially that of the Frankfurt School as represented by the work of \nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas and his colleagues. Habermas is best known for his work on the ethical \npossibilities of modern forms of social solidarity. Habermas divides up knowledge-constitutive \ninterests (1971, ch.9) \u2013 the means by which subjects organize social life \u2013 into three areas: \ntechnical interests (work life); practical interests (social life); and emancipatory interests \n(freedom from existing constraints) (Habermas 1983, pt. III). Habermas argues that the ethical \npromise of modern social life lies in the generation of forms of communicative action in which \ntruth claims and moral action arise out of free and equal exchange between individuals engaging \nin \u201cideal-speech situations\u201d. Even if modernity generates friction between the anomie of the \nsocial \u201csystem\u201d and the communicative rationality of the \u201clife-world\u201d (1987, ch.6), moral \nconduct and political action comes about through recovering and promoting the latter (1987, \nch.8). Perhaps the most sustained engagement with Habermas in IR comes from Andrew \nLinklater (see also Risse 2000). Linklater argues that the \u201clife-world\u201d of international relations \nexhibits a thin form of moral universalism. Indeed, the spread of dialogic reasoning via the \nuniversalisation of the modern subject around the world serves to transform the moral \ncomposition of international relations (Linklater 1998, 2005). Cosmopolitan theory in IR along \nthe lines proposed by Linklater effectively transposes sociological arguments about the need to \nsustain ethical forms of solidarity within modern societies characterised by anomie to the global \nlevel.  \n \nIn effect, therefore, sociological approaches have informed the question of whether qualitatively \ndifferent forms of social life exist in the domestic and international spheres. And sociological \napproaches have also informed debates about whether the social solidarity promised in the \ndomestic sphere can be cultivated both across and beyond borders. In his contribution to this \nforum, Daniel Chernilo addresses both the content of modern social solidarity and the ethical \npossibilities of social life arising from this form. Chernilo critiques the view that classical \nsociology suffers from a \u201cmethodological nationalism\u201d in the sense of a conflation between \n \n9 \nmodern society and the nation-state. Chernillo takes up these issues by reference to the synergies \ndrawn between structural realism and the English School (Buzan, Jones and Little 1993; Buzan \nand Little 1996), and the emergence of a research agenda around the concept of world society \n(Buzan 2004), Chernilo argues that the critique of \u201cmethodological nationalism\u201d is taken up in \nIR as the critique of the \u201cdomestic analogy\u201d. This critique is associated with Hedley Bull, a \nclassical resource of the contemporary English School. Chernillo notes that the \u201cdomestic \nanalogy\u201d critique is essentially a denial of a position which argues that the modes of order within \ndomestic societies can be transposed to the international realm. Alternatively, Chernilo argues, it \nis possible to extract an implicit universalism within classical social theory \u2013 itself drawn from \nthe European tradition of natural law \u2013 which can be used to theorise international dynamics, in \nthe process making the \u201cdomestic analogy\u201d problem in IR appear to be something of a canard.   \n \nSociological approaches to the issue of the \u201csocial\u201d international have also informed the ways in \nwhich subjectivity and inter-subjectivity have been understood in IR. Indeed, in many ways, the \nproblematique of inter-subjectivity in the contemporary social sciences is one defined by the \nchallenge of explaining how systems of rule and order can adhere when they interpolate their \nunits as anarchical\/anomic individuals. Many of the \u201cthird debate\u201d critiques of positivism in IR, \nfor example, employed hermeneutics and interpretive sociology in the pursuit of \u201cpost-positivist\u201d \ntheory. In other words, rather than assuming that rational self-interested action is a pre-social \nbehavioural response to external stimuli, a number of critics, using sociological resources, have \nargued that instrumental rationality is merely one, peculiarly modern, form of rational \nsubjectivity (Walker, 1993, ch.3; George, 1994). To this end, critics have employed concepts \ndrawn from perhaps the pre-eminent sociologist of instrumental rationality \u2013 Max Weber.  \n \nMuch of Weber\u2019s sociology was concerned with examining why \u2013 and how \u2013 modern forms of \nrationality, social action and political rule took on the form of instrumental rationality. For \nexample, in his thesis on the \u201cProtestant Ethic\u201d (2001), Weber argued that \u201cthe Protestant \ncalling\u201d was historically exceptional amongst spiritual maxims in that it sought neither \nindulgence in earthly pleasures nor a flight from this world. Rather, Protestantism demanded an \nascetic of labour within the world. However, for Weber, this pursuit led to \u201cdisenchantment\u201d in \nthat individuals became subject to privileging predictability and calculation to the detriment of \n \n10 \nthe value-laden ends that social action was supposed to be mobilised towards (Weber 1978a, 66-\n68). For Weber, the product of this disenchantment (instrumental rationality) was distinguished \nfrom other forms of rationality (value, emotive and traditional) by the ways in which it self-\nconsciously stripped away the relation between social and moral action. In parallel fashion, \ninstrumental rationality could be distinguished from other ideal-types of political authority \n(charismatic and traditional authority) by the ways in which it allowed technical means to master \nmoral ends. Weber\u2019s study of how modern bureaucracies produced and reproduced the pursuit of \ncalculating, predictable action in order to generate a disenchanted world of \u201cicy, polar darkness\u201d \nstand as landmarks in the field (1978b, 958-975).  \n \nIR scholars have used Weber\u2019s critique of rational instrumentality and his conception of \n\u201clegitimate authority\u201d in numerous debates, not least those surrounding the authority and \nstanding of international organizations (Lawson 2006). For example, work by Michael Barnett \nand Martha Finnemore (2004) has indicated the extent to which international institutions assign \nmeaning and normative values to certain modes of behavior, helping to construct and constitute \nthe social world in their image. By carrying out the \u201cduties of office\u201d and \u201cdoing their job\u201d, \ninternational organizations control information and establish a level of expertise that states \ncannot possess. This specialized knowledge shapes rather than merely implements the policy \ndirectives of states. Hence, UN peacekeepers have an authority that stems from their role as \nneutral, independent actors implementing Security Council resolutions. The World Bank \nclassifies who can be considered \u201cpeasants\u201d, \u201cfarmers\u201d and \u201claborers\u201d, and asserts its authority \nby dictating the content and direction of global development programs. The United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees has the power to set up camps, and make life and death decisions, \nwithout recourse to consultation with the UN\u2019s member states. Likewise, international \norganizations often establish a relative autonomy from the states that set them up by constructing \ncategories of actors (like refugees), promoting new interests (such as human rights), or \ntransferring models of political association around the world (in particular, democracy). In short, \ninternational organizations fix meanings, establish rules, and transmit norms around the \ninternational realm. This does not necessarily entail that they do this job well. Indeed, as Barnett \nand Finnemore (2004) acknowledge, factionalism, turf wars, cumbersome decision-making \nprocesses and self-insulated elites do not make for high-quality policy making. But the key point \n \n11 \nis that these lines of inquiry pick up the Weberian argument that instrumental rational action is \nnot simply a behavioural constant of human nature, but a particular form of social action \nimmanent to the exercise of modern political power whether this is exercised domestically or \ninternationally. \n \nWeber\u2019s work on disenchantment and the \u201ciron cage\u201d of instrumental rational rule resonates with \nmuch of the Frankfurt School of critical theorists, including Adorno and Horkheimer (1997), \nMarcuse (1964) and Habermas (1987). Indeed, the instrumental-rationalization of social relations \nand the values imputed to them is an abiding feature of sociological approaches that focus on the \nways in which modernity subverts the promise of enlightenment freedom. Weber, in this respect, \nshares a strong family resemblance (in the Wittgenstein sense) with Michel Foucault\u2019s (1991) \nwork on \u201cgovernmentality\u201d (\u201cthe art of government\u201d).  For Foucault, modernity represents a \ntotalising script in which conduct itself is managed by the techniques of an overweening array of \ndisciplinary bureaucracies. Indeed, Foucault argues, control in modernity is exerted not just \nthrough intermediary institutions, but also in the form of \u201cbio-power\u201d \u2013 control over internal as \nwell as external modes of subjectivity. In his contribution to this forum, Robert Deuchars extends \nFoucault\u2019s notion of governmentality to the international sphere. Deuchars examines the ways in \nwhich international techniques of rule \u2013 in particular, risk management and insurance regimes \u2013 \nact as a form of bio-politics which, in turn, governs populations by rendering them as calculating \nobjects. Deuchars shows how international organization is best conceived as the geo-\ngovernmentality of a \u201cglobal social\u201d rather than as a discrete form of interstate relations. In fine, \nDeuchars shows how a critical sociological approach can enhance understanding of global \ngovernance by revealing the inter-subjective dimensions of instrumental rational forms of global \nrule manifested in the quotidian practices of credit rating, risk assessment, accounting and \ninsurance. By including a searching critique of the roots of the 2007 credit crunch in his analysis, \nDeuchars demonstrates how Foucauldian analysis can generate compelling empirical arguments \nalongside powerful theoretical claims. \n \nA shared Eurocentrism \nThus far, we have considered the beneficial insights that Sociology brings to IR both explicitly \nand, on occasion, more implicitly. However, IR is supposed to (at least definitionally) take the \n \n12 \nwhole world as its canvass, and it is with regards to this \u201cglobal scope condition\u201d that Sociology \nfalls short. Indeed, the two disciplines share a common blind spot when it comes to this issue: \noftentimes, both IR and Sociology concern themselves with the emergence and ambiguities \ncontained within Western, particularly European, social and political orders. But this raises an \nimportant question: can European modernity represent global modernity?  \n \nClassical sociological analysis was intimately informed by observations of the non-European \nworld, even if these were made through a coloniser\u2019s optic. For example, Durkheim\u2019s (1965) \nsociology of religion focused its attention on Australian aboriginal belief systems, while his work \non the division of labour was oriented around a contrast between (ostensibly European) \n\u201ctraditional\u201d communities and the \u201csavage peoples\u201d of America and the South Pacific (for \nexample 1964, 58-59). Durkheim\u2019s nephew and student, Marcel Mauss (1979), looked at the \ndevelopment of the modern individual as a conscious, moral agent by contrast to the \u201cprimitive\u201d \ncollective roles found within American Indian and Australian aboriginal groups. At the same \ntime, Weber\u2019s (1963) sociology constructed ideal-typical tools which contrasted European forms \nof disenchantment with \u201cEastern\u201d belief systems. And for his part, Marx\u2019s later writings \u2013 \nincluding his thoughts on the potentials of the traditional Russian commune (mir) \u2013 were \ninfluenced by anthropologies of \u201cprimitives\u201d provided by figures such as Lewis Henry Morgan, \nwho undertook one of the first ethnographies on the American Iroquois (on these issues, see \nShanin 1983). The justification for investigating \u201crude and early tribes\u201d in the mid- to late- \nnineteenth century was usually posited in terms of \u201cknowing\u201d the savage and barbarian in order \nto better understand the \u201ccivilized\u201d (see especially Tylor 1964; and Morgan 1964). And these \ninvestigations often relied upon historical narratives enthused by the mystique of a pristine, \nprimal human past. With the development and spread of ethnographic methods, Europeans \ngained knowledge of the \u201cprimitive\u201d by living within \u201cexotic\u201d communities (Malinowski 1922), \nin turn, shifting studies of the \u201cprimitive condition\u201d from the status of historical conjecture to one \nconcerned with establishing social facts. As social anthropology developed in the inter-war \nyears, the primitive subject was opened up to detailed observation on the assumption that he\/she \ninhabited a Durkheimian social system with roles that could be scientifically expressed (see \nespecially Radcliffe-Brown 1948, 229-234). Concomitantly, the primitive condition became less \nabout being understood as a mythic-historical figure to an object of comparative-sociological \n \n13 \nstudy. In this way, Meyer Fortes and Edward Evans-Pritchard (1940), although anthropologists, \nproduced work which would nowadays be regarded as \u201ccomparative politics\u201d. \n \nSociologists have often been concerned to make a principled distinction between their study of \nmodernity and the study of the primitive by anthropologists. However, Roger Masters (1964) \nused social-anthropological studies to shed light on the thin sociality of the international sphere \nas a primitive form of governance. And Hedley Bull later used Masters\u2019 work as inspiration for \nhis conceptualisation of international relations as exhibiting an \u201canarchical society\u201d (1977, 57-\n62). More recently, Aaron Sampson (2002) has argued that one of the things that attracted Waltz \nto a Durkheimian structural-functional theory of the anarchical international system was his \nreading of social anthropology. Taken in this light, Waltz\u2019s international theory can, perhaps, \nbest be seen as an example of \u201ctropical anarchy\u201d. Alongside IR\u2019s well known \u201cdomestic \nanalogy\u201d problem (Bull 1977; Suganami 1989), therefore, can also be found a \u201cgeo-cultural \nanalogy\u201d \u2013 the assumption that modernization in non-European cultures and societies, \ntransmitted through colonialism and imperialism, have essentially been derivative (or, at times, a \nmimicry) of the original dual revolutions of late eighteenth century Europe (e.g. Bull and Watson \neds 1984; Gong 1984; Buzan and Little 2000, Suzuki 2009). \n \nWhat becomes clear from this discussion is that the relationship between Sociology and IR must \nbe explored not just by reference to the pre-modern\/modern problematique, but also via \nrecognition of the primitive\/modern divide that exists within this problematique. While it is true \nthat the non-European \u201cprimitive\u201d has commonly been deployed in parallel to the European pre-\nmodern subject, a characteristic of this relationship is to see the primitive other as formed by the \nEuropean gaze rather than as a subject created in the process of the gaze itself (Fabian 1983). \nIndeed, the colonial inflection of sociological analysis evident in much classical theory and \nsocial anthropology denies the co-constitutive relationship between the primitive, the pre-modern \nand the modern (Asad ed 1973). Gurminder Bhambra\u2019s contribution to this forum engages \nspecifically \u2013 and critically \u2013 with this inflection. Bhambra\u2019s critique is situated within one of \nSociology\u2019s most prominent sub-fields \u2013 historical sociology. Since the 1980s, and particularly \nover recent years, advocates of historical sociology have made substantial footprints in IR, \ncontributing to debates ranging from the emergence of the modern states-system to unravelling \n \n14 \nthe core features and relative novelty of the contemporary historical conjuncture (e.g. Rosenberg \n1994, 2005; Teschke 2003; Hobson 2004). However, despite the upsurge of interest in historical \nsociology (e.g. Hobden and Hobson eds 2002; Lawson, 2007) and a burgeoning scholarship on \ninter-social forms of historical development (Hobson, Lawson and Rosenberg 2010), much IR \nscholarship remains cut off from the world beyond the West (Shilliam 2008). Bhambra argues \nthat, despite appearances to the contrary, historical sociology in IR remains stuck in a purview \nwhich sees inter-connections as something constituted by European societies to \u201cothers\u201d, thereby \ngranting the latter only a subaltern identity. Intriguingly, although post-colonial inquiry has \nsought to illuminate this identity by concentrating on the constitutive impact of the non-\nEuropean world on the formation of the modern world, it frequently omits these co-constitutive \ninterconnections. By focusing on \u201cconnected histories\u201d, Bhambra shows how important it is for \nhistorical sociology in IR to critically address the colonial narrative that has framed \ninvestigations of what should be considered as our \u201cglobal modernity\u201d. Bhambra\u2019s endorsement \nof narrational inter-connections as providing the means for overcoming unhelpful self-other \nbinaries highlights a central motivation for this forum \u2013 furthering inter-connections in the \nacademic realm itself.  \n \nProspects \nGiven that so many contemporary academic approaches are either trans-disciplinary (post-\nstructuralism and the broader cultural turn) or joint-disciplinary (such as gender and ethnic \nstudies), the type of engagement suggested by this forum (in general) and by Bhambra\u2019s piece (in \nparticular) can be considered as both potentially fertile and increasingly widespread (Lawson \n2008a). Given this, and granting the narrowness of much of IR\u2019s intellectual agenda as sketched \nout in the first part of this Introduction, it is hardly a surprise to see a call by IR scholars, funding \nbodies and the wider academy to work beyond the confines of sometimes arbitrary and \nfrequently constraining disciplinary perimeters. Such steps are made all the more urgent by the \nnon-disciplinary nature of many of the issues which most engage contemporary students and \nacademics: religion, culture, terrorism, nationalism, globalisation and so on. Indeed, one \ncelebrated advocate of interdisciplinarity, Immanuel Wallerstein, has chaired a commission \nwhich made the case for recasting social science as \u201cpluralistic universalism\u201d, akin \u201cto the Indian \npantheon, wherein a single god has many avatars\u201d (Gulbenkian Commission 1996, 59-60).  \n \n15 \n Wallerstein\u2019s (2004) vision of \u201cuni-disciplinarity\u201d is intended as a return to a nineteenth century \nview of the social scientific enterprise, a time before disciplines sought the relative autonomy \nand security which flowed from discrete disciplinary edges. However, even if we accept \nWallerstein\u2019s basic point \u2013 that the social world is a totality only artificially separated into \ndiscrete spheres marked by the boundaries of academic disciplines \u2013 there needs to be a degree \nof caution about how (and whether) these disciplines should be reintegrated. After all, it may be \nthat, at least up to a point, disciplinary and professional separation is no bad thing. Although \nawareness of work in other disciplines is part of the lifeblood of the intellectual imagination, it is \nunlikely that engagement with the primary turf of other disciplines can ever take place with the \nsame levels of depth or knowledge which specialists bring to a subject. Often, it seems, \ninterdisciplinarity entails an attraction to the mainstream of another subject, either delivering an \noff-the-shelf reading of a particular debate, or reading instrumentally about a certain issue in a \nway that precludes understanding of the more interesting terrain which lies beneath the surface \n(Lawson 2005). As such, interdisciplinary researchers often lack the means to arbitrate between \nrival specialist interpretations, a process Joseph Bryant (2005) describes as \u201cnarrational \ndiscordance\u201d. One of the lessons of the last few years of international politics, both for \ngovernment and academics, is that specialist knowledge of an area, issue or language (such as \nthe Middle East, Iraq or Arabic) generates a depth of understanding which few generalists can \nmatch. In this sense, it is worth recognising that, although the social sciences constitute a single \nfamily in which some relations are unnecessarily fractured, some subjects appear as only distant \ncousins. Just as General Practitioners do not conduct heart by-pass operations, hysterectomy\u2019s \nand neurological procedures, so matters of specialist importance are likely to be beyond the \nrange of those conducting interdisciplinary work. \n \nAs noted above, this issue is particularly acute for International Relations. If Barry Buzan and \nRichard Little (2001) are right \u2013 and we think that they are \u2013 IR has a semi-permeable membrane \nwhich allows ideas from other disciplines in, but blocks substantive traffic travelling in the \nopposite direction. As a result, just as politics has gone international, so researchers from outside \nIR have sought to occupy turf one might expect the discipline to inhabit. Indeed, figures as \ndiverse as Noam Chomsky, Niall Ferguson and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek have a far higher profile than those \n \n16 \nwithin IR even on issues which speak to the heart of contemporary world politics: Iraq, war, the \nnature and extent of American power, and so on. As Buzan and Little argue (2001, 20), when the \nquestion is posed: what have other disciplines learned from IR, the cupboard is, \u201cif not quite \nbare, then certainly not well stocked\u201d. Buzan and Little claim that this story of one-way traffic \nstems from IR\u2019s triple confinement behind a Eurocentric ahistoricism which isomorphises the \nWestphalian moment, a sectoral narrowness which privileges military and political power \nrelations, and an increasing fragmentation into house journals, styles and languages. As they \nwrite (2001, 31), \u201cIn the end, mainstream IR theory has preferred to think small and narrow \nrather than big and wide\u201d. And there seems little doubt that, for much of its existence, IR has \nbeen a relatively subordinate discipline, a net-importer of ideas content to ride academic fads and \nfashions, but unable to shape them in its own image.  \n \nThis leads to a second challenge inherent to interdisciplinary research: its tendency to dissolve \ninto cannibalism. Interdisciplinarity rarely works on a level playing field. More often, it works as \na means for one discipline to colonise the turf of another. As such, border raids become akin to \nViking raiding parties with booty carried off in one direction and little to show for it in the other. \nIndeed, these \u201clooting and pillaging raids\u201d (Mann 1995, 555) conjure up an image more akin to \nintellectual asset stripping than to fertile inter-relationship. There are numerous examples of this \ntype of tendency at play. In IR, many constructivists appear to have ignored \u2013 either by accident \nof design \u2013 what symbolic interactionists have been arguing for the past century or more. Equally \ngalling is the use by game theorists of a thick form of rational choice which is increasingly out of \nfavour in economics, and the physics envy which has driven IR towards a peculiar form of \nscientism quite out of keeping with its principal subject matter. Indeed, it is striking how few IR \ntheorists have taken an interest in biology or geology, \u201chistorical sciences\u201d which appear far \nmore suited to the complexity of world politics than physics (Gould 1990). Although biology and \ngeology work within broad overarching paradigms \u2013 natural selection and plate tectonics \nrespectively \u2013 it is only through comparative analysis in which processes are traced, patterns \ndeduced and taxonomies constructed that knowledge is seen to accumulate (Ziman 1991; Gleick \n1988; Waldrop 1992). As such, complexity, contingency, uncertainty and particularity are \nnecessary features of these sciences rather than anomalies to be explained away. But despite the \nmany overlaps between the enterprises, neither biology nor geology feature widely in IR\u2019s \n \n17 \nscientific gaze. And from the other side of the interdisciplinary divide, it is apparent that macro-\nsociologists have much to learn from IR, not least regarding the constitutive role of inter-social \ndynamics in processes of state formation, economic development and conflict (Halliday 1999; \nHobson 2005). Comparable points could be made about any number of fields, not least political \ntheory (Lawson 2008b), the study of globalisation (Rosenberg 2005), and more. In general, it \nseems as if what most interdisciplinary travellers want is not the detail of, or immersion in, the \ndebates which lie beneath the surface of a discipline\u2019s principal books and journals, but the \nbasics \u2013 a Rough Guide or Lonely Planet \u2013 which can help them navigate through the foreign \nterrain they are visiting and which can guide them safely home thereafter.   \n \nOn the one hand, therefore, interdisciplinarity creates opportunities for what Bruce Carruthers \n(2005) calls \u201cconstructive misbehaviour\u201d \u2013 a chance for intellectual entrepreneurs to act as \ntranslators, borrowing concepts and data from one academic discipline and introducing them into \nanother. Such acts of arbitrage, when they are done well, can reduce levels of \u201cintellectual \nautism\u201d (Steinmetz 2005) \u2013 the narrowing of a field under the watchful scrutiny of academic \nhomeland security agents. But it is important not to get too carried away with openness and \nfluidity both within disciplines and between them. Interdisciplinarity can engender thinness and \nsloppiness as well as promote depth and rigour. Obscuring root-and-branch differences can serve \nto make bridge-building enterprises a metaphor for hostile takeovers, a means of amplifying \nsmall differences, or of generating intellectual dilettantism. For IR, what is needed is a two way \nstreet in which the subject is more fully integrated into the broad family that constitutes the \nsocial sciences, not as an adjunct to more prominent cousins, but as a relatively autonomous field \nwith substantive points to make about the complex processes which make up world politics. Just \nas no country can really be autarkic in the true sense of the word, and no individual is an island, \nit is also self-evidently the case that no discipline exists in pristine isolation from others, however \njealously it guards its intellectual space. But these exchanges, lifeblood as they are to the \nintellectual enterprise, need to be carefully mediated. \n \nBy focusing on how sociologists themselves imagine both the theory and substance of \ninternational relations, this forum hopes to make more apparent the disciplinary influence of \nSociology on IR and, in the process, enable IR scholarship to take a firmer grasp of its principal \n \n18 \ndomain assumptions. Our principal message is straightforward: although sociological concepts \nand approaches have often been repressed by the international imagination, their \u201couting\u201d has \nmuch to offer both disciplines. Although the contributions to this forum concentrate on the move \nfrom Sociology to IR, we hope \u2013 and expect \u2013 that this engagement will encourage journeys in \nthe opposite direction. We do not claim to have exhausted the possibilities of this exchange \u2013 far \nfrom it. Indeed, notable by its absence is a discussion of systems theory, particularly the \npowerful work on functional differentiation in IR which has been derived from Durkheim and \nthe work of the German functionalist, Niklas Luhmann (e.g. Albert and Hilkermeier eds 2004, \nBuzan and Albert 2010, Donnelly 2009). Equally prominent by its absence is a pronounced \nengagement with Marxism, an approach which has contributed significantly both to international \ntheory in general (e.g. Rosenberg 1994, Teschke 2003) and to sub-fields such as international \npolitical economy (e.g. Cox 1986; Gill 2008; Morton 2007).  \n \nDespite these (mostly self-imposed) limitations, the forum delivers some good news \u2013 \nsociological concepts and approaches are frequently employed in IR, often to sound effect. On \nthe other hand, IR, especially the mainstream of the discipline, has yet to recognise the full debt \nit owes \u2013 both good and bad \u2013 to Sociology. All three pieces in this forum point to a more \nsustained engagement between IR and Sociology, one which avoids the traps of cannibalism and \nsubordination which such interdisciplinary exchange can, on occasion, foster. Indeed, it may be \nthat, as much sociological theory goes \u201cglobal\u201d, or at least \u201cinternational\u201d, synergies between the \ntwo enterprises lead to a period of sustained intellectual exchange. To that end, this forum is \nextremely timely, enhancing a return of the sociological repressed in the international \nimagination which, in turn, should foster dynamic engagements between the two disciplines. \nGiven this, the promise of an \u201cinternational sociology\u201d may be rich indeed (Halliday 2002).  \n \n19 \nReferences \n \nAdorno, Theodor and Max Horkheimer (1997) The Dialectic of Enlightenment (London: Verso). \n \nAlbert, Mathias and Lena Hilkermeier (eds) (2004) Observing International Relations: Niklas \nLuhmann and World Politics (London: Routledge). \n \nAsad, Talal (ed) (1973) Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter (New York: Humanities). \n \nAshworth, Lucian (1999) Creating International Studies: Angell, Mitrany and the Liberal \nTradition (Aldershot: Ashgate).  \n  \nBarkdull, John (1995) \u2018Waltz, Durkheim and International Relations: The International System \nas an Abnormal Form\u2019, American Political Science Review 89:3, 669-680. \n \nBarnett, Michael and Martha Finnemore (2004) Rules for the World: International Organizations \nin Global Politics (Ithaca: Cornell University Press). \n  \nBenjamin, Walter (1999) Illuminations (London: Pimlico). \n \nBerger, Peter and Thomas Luckmann (1967) The Social Construction of Reality (London: \nPenguin). \n \nBhaskar, Roy (1975) A Realist Theory of Science (Leeds Books)  \n \nBottomore, Tom (1984) Sociology and Socialism (Brighton: Wheatsheaf) \n \nBryant, Joseph (2005) \u2018Grand, Yet Grounded\u2019, in John Hall and Ralph Schroeder (eds), An \nAnatomy of Power (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 71-98. \n \nBull, Hedley (1977) The Anarchical Society (London: Palgrave).  \n \nBull, Hedley and Adam Watson (eds) (1984) The Expansion of International Society (Oxford: \nOxford University Press). \n \nBuzan, Barry (2004) From International to World Society?
