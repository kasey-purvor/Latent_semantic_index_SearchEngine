For the case where the latter has been\nstimulated by incident radiation, the phenomenon is often\ntermed radiation-induced charge neutralization \u0001RICN\u0002. In\nthe context of qualifying commercial integrated circuits \u0001ICs\u0002\nfor industrial applications, especially in aerospace, the varia-\ntion in threshold voltage is often referred to as a parasitic\nfield-oxide transistor shift. Further exposure of a device bi-\nased \u201coff,\u201d or indeed with a negative gate potential, acts to\nreduce the threshold voltage shift. This decreases the leakage\ncurrent significantly and thereby elevates the failure dose of\na dynamically biased part. Therefore, a thorough understand-\ning of the dynamics of RICN is important where MOS de-\nvices are subject to a combination of switched bias and ra-\ndiation exposure.\nMOS structures are also being used increasingly for ra-\ndiation dose measurement. This is principally as metal-\noxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor \u0001MOSFET\u0002 do-\nsimeters for applications in space and for quality assurance\nin medical radiotherapy. RICN poses a risk in these scenarios\nbecause inadvertent reverse biasing of these devices will re-\nverse and undermine the cumulative dose response of the\ndevice.

Redistribution subject to Athe effect of this phenomenon, is at best difficult and will\noften completely undermine the validity of the response.\nIn contrast to the MOS devices that have been the focus\nof studies into RICN to date, the MOSFET dosimeter is\nmanufactured with a thick gate oxide, in order to increase its\nsensitivity to ionizing radiation. Dosimeters based on the\np-MOS field-effect transistor1 are often referred to as\nMOSFET dosimeters, radiation sensitive field-effect transis-\ntor \u0001RADFETs\u0002,2 or space-charge dosimeters. They have\nbeen employed in the measurement of radiation dose in a\nvariety of applications, including those environments associ-\nated with particle accelerators and space-bourne satellites.\nPerhaps the greatest potential for these devices is in the\nmedical sector associated with dose measurement in diagnos-\ntic or therapeutic radiobiology.\nThere are several commercial variants and systems cur-\nrently available3 for characterization and quality assurance in\nexternal beam radiotherapy.4 The main advantages of the\nMOSFET dosimeter are that it is small, low power, compara-\ntively low cost, physically robust, and solid state. The\nMOSFET dosimeter provides an integrated response and\ndoes not require a power supply during irradiation, although\nimproved sensitivity and reduced uncertainty can be afforded\nunder a degree of positive gate bias.\nThe design of the MOSFET dosimeter has been opti-\nmized to yield a response that is independent of dose rate5\nfor low dose-rate applications in space. More recently, the\nMOSFET dosimeter has found numerous applications in\nnuclear medicine,6\u20139 for example, in mammography,10 diag-\nnostic radiology,11 radiotherapy beam profiling,12 and\nintensity-modulated radiotherapy.13 The angular response has\n14,15been the focus of several recent studies. Recently, we\n\u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics05-1\nIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n044505-2 Benson et al. J. Appl. Phys. 100, 044505 \u00022006\u0001have explored MOSFET applications in neutron dosimetry,16\nthe statistical uncertainty in their response to x rays,17 and\nthe development of a linear MOSFET array for intracavatary\nin vivo dosimetry.18\nThe process by which the MOSFET responds to radia-\ntion is well understood. Incident ionizing radiation, typically\nphotons, results in the liberation of electron-hole pairs. An\nelectric field is established across the oxide, Eox, either re-\nsulting merely from the contact potential of the disparate\ncarrier densities of the neighboring regions or enhanced by\napplied positive bias, and this causes the carriers to separate\nand drift. The electrons are swept out of the active region,\nwhile the holes are drawn to the interface with the silicon\ndioxide, where they become trapped. Here the holes act to\nreduce the depletion region of the device; a phenomenon\nwhich can be identified and studied in several ways using\nelectrical characterization tools or impedance measurement.\nThe change in threshold voltage Vt can be decomposed into\nthat due to positive oxide-trapped charge \u0002Vot and\nnegatively-charged interface states \u0002Vit. While well under-\nstood, the buildup of oxide-trapped charge is a complex,\nnonlinear process that is dependent on the local field in the\noxide, which is itself modulated by the trapped hole popula-\ntion.\nThe accepted physical model for RICN was devised by\nFleetwood.19 Under positive bias, the process, as described\nabove, results in holes trapped at the Si\/SiO2 interface.\nWhen the bias is switched off, Eox is induced by the trapped\npositive charge and is in the opposite direction; indeed this\ncan be exacerbated by providing negative bias to the gate\nduring subsequent irradiation. With the field reversed, some\nof the trapped holes at the Si\/SiO2 interface are swept to the\ngate. However, many remain trapped. Electron-hole pairs lib-\nerated by the incident radiation are separated, but their direc-\ntion of travel is reversed in comparison with the correspond-\ning phenomenon under positive bias. The electrons migrate\nto the interface where they can be trapped nearby or recom-\nbine with the trapped holes. The effect of the radiation on the\ndevice\u2019s electrical parameters established under positive bias\nis thus neutralized.\nThe objective of the research reported in this paper was\nto explore and characterize the dependence of RICN with\napplied reverse bias. This measurement has been performed\non devices exposed to two primary dose levels under forward\nbias. The optimum bias level for RICN has been estimated\nfor each primary dose in both cases. The dependence of\nRICN with reverse bias has been compared with two empiri-\ncal mathematical models and the most consistent is deter-\nmined. The field dependence of RICN beyond the optimum\nbias indicates a dependence that is reduced in comparison\nwith the known dependence of the recombination cross sec-\ntion \u0001r with electric field in the oxide. This observation may\nbe due to a combination of compensation and recombination.\nThe field dependence of cross section for RICN \u0001N repre-\nsents the dependence of both phenomena.\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe MOSFET devices used in this work were all sup-plied by the Tyndall Institute, Cork, Ireland.

The MOSFET\ndevice die is 1 mm2 and comprises of two 300\/50 \u0003m\n\u0001width\/length\u0002 devices and two 690\/15 \u0003m devices. The ox-\nide thickness of all devices used in this study was 400 nm.\nThis gives each device a natural threshold voltage of be-\ntween 7 and 8 V; however, the devices used in this study\nhave undergone an implant of boron to reduce the threshold\nvoltage to around 0.5\u20132 V. This provides a greater dynamic\nrange for the radiation-induced threshold voltage response.20\nA measurement of the threshold voltage of a MOSFET\ndevice was made with a reader circuit, as shown in Fig. 2.\nThis arrangement measures the gate-source voltage required\nto conduct a fixed channel current. In this research a channel\ncurrent of 10 \u0003A has been used for this purpose.

When the sourcem-\neter is connected over GPIB, this system provides an accu-\nracy of \u00b11 \u0003V \u0001one standard deviation from the mean\u0002. The\nsoftware used to control the sourcemeter over the GPIB was\nwritten in C using MICROSOFT VISUAL C\u0004\u0004. The threshold\nvoltage was measured 10 s after the initial turn on of supply\ncurrent to the MOSFET device. This provides a more stable\nmeasurement of the threshold voltage since the short-term\ndrift due to border traps21 is reduced.22\nThe MOSFET dosimeters have been irradiated within a\npolymethylmethacrylate \u0001PMMA\u0002 phantom to ensure charge\nequilibrium in the vicinity of the MOSFET and uniform ra-\ndiation dose. The dimensions of the phantom were 300\n\u0005300\u0005200 mm. The PMMA phantom was placed upon a\nsmall \u0001approximately 10 cm\u0002 stack of fiberboard in order to\nallow sufficient depth of material below the MOSFET to\nensure the full backscattering of electrons. The MOSFET\ndevice, including its 14-pin package, is mounted on a printed\ncircuit board \u0001PCB\u0002 at a depth of 70 mm below the surface\nof the PMMA phantom. A narrow channel is provided to\nallow cabling to connect the device to the measurement and\nirradiation equipment described above. In order to verify the\ndose delivered to the MOSFET device, a Farmer dosimeter\nwith a chamber of volume of 0.6 cm3 \u0001type NE 2571\u0002 was\nlocated at the same depth as the MOSFET device within the\nphantom. This chamber and related electrometer were cali-\nbrated according to national protocols and factors traced\nback to national dosimetry standards at the National Physical\nLaboratory, Teddington, Middlesex, UK. The Doseleader\n\u0001type 2610\u0002 calibrated electrometer records the output of this\nchamber in order to ensure the consistency of the doses\ndelivered.\nIn order to study RICN, a total of 12 p-MOSFET devices\nwere irradiated in two groups of six. All 12 devices were\nirradiated under a forward bias of +5 V with all other device\nterminals grounded, which we shall henceforth term \u201cpri-\nmary\u201d dose. One group of six were irradiated to a primary\ndose of 48 Gy and the other group to a primary dose of\n80 Gy. The threshold voltage of all MOSFETs was measured\nafter this exposure. Each device was then irradiated in dose\nsteps of 4 Gy, with increasing steps in reverse bias. The\nthreshold voltage was measured after each exposure as be-\nfore. The devices were irradiated to photons produced from\nan Elekta linear accelerator \u0001LINAC\u0002 operated at 6 MV at\nthe Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology National Health Ser-\nvice \u0001NHS\u0002 Trust, Clatterbridge, UK.\nRESULTS\nFigure 3 is a plot of the change in threshold voltage Vt in\nvolts \u0001V\u0002 versus dose in Gray \u0001Gy\u0002 for a complete experi-\nmental cycle of this work. The change in threshold voltage is\nrelative to zero dose, and implicitly we are considering a\nnegative change, since radiation under positive bias leads to\na reduction in threshold voltage in the p-MOS transistors\nused in this research. In Fig. 3 the behavior of the threshold\nvoltage for the primary dose of 48 Gy is shown; similar\ntrends were observed for the primary dose of 80 Gy and are\nnot included in this work in the interests of brevity.\nDownloaded 27 Mar 2008 to 194.80.32.9. Redistribution subject to AUnder positive bias the threshold voltage changes sig-\nnificantly, following the well-known linear approximation\nthat is valid for small dose levels. This dependence, borne\nout of an approximation to an exponential trend, is well\ndocumented elsewhere for the devices used in this work. For\nthis reason, the data in between the extremes shown here\nhave not been included. Beyond 48 Gy, where the bias has\nbeen reversed, the threshold voltage is observed to fall\ngradually. Similar trends are observed for all levels of nega-\ntive bias used.\nFigures 4 and 5 show the data for threshold voltage\nchange as a function of dose under negative bias for the\nprimary doses of 48 and 80 Gy, respectively. Nonlinear fits\nhave been applied to each data set of the form\nVt\u0001D\u0002 = \u0006e\u2212\u0007D, \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0006 and \u0007 are constants and D is dose. Note that the\ndata in Figs. 4 and 5 have been normalized to zero Vt at the\npoint where the bias has been reversed. This removes any\nvariation between the data sets for different devices and cor-\nresponds to a uniform value of \u0006 throughout the data. This\nhas been done to extract the rate of Vt recovery, which is\ndescribed by \u0007 in Eq. \u00011\u0002. The data for \u0007, as a function of\nnegative bias, are given in Table I.\nIn Fig. 6, the recovery parameter \u0007 \u0001Gy\u22121\u0002 has been\nplotted against negative bias \u0001V\u0002, for the case of the two\nprimary doses: 48 and 80 Gy.

The data arising from the two primary doses inves-\ntigated in this work indicate that the level of primary dose\ndoes not appear to influence the bias at which optimum\nRICN occurs. However, this is clearly only based on two\nmeasurements so this interpretation must be treated with\ncaution.\nThe levels of negative bias corresponding to optimum\nRICN, measured in this work, are consistent with the range\nin negative bias for optimum RICN rate reported in previous\nstudies.19 However, an approximately constant dependence\nwith reverse bias, as has been suggested, is not observed.\nThe previous studies were of devices with much thinner ox-\nides, putting the corresponding oxide field regimes in differ-\nent classes and thus increasing the influence of interface\nTABLE I.

By contrast, the data\nin this work exhibit a nonlinear dependence on either side of\nthe optimum bias level.\nThe dependence of recovery with reverse bias\nThe two fits to the dependence of the recovery parameter\n\u0007 with reverse bias, shown in Fig. 6, are both acceptable\nstatistical analyses of the RICN data. Expression \u00013\u0002 gives\nthe best representation of the data for both primary doses. If\na deeper physical interpretation of RICN data is not required\nthen this is the best model to use. The usual caveat associated\nwith radiation effects in MOS transistors should be borne in\nmind, i.e., that devices from contrasting fabrication sources\nwill exhibit statistical variation around and possibly beyond\nthe fit parameters given here. However, it is reasonable to\nexpect the trends across MOSFET dosimeters from different\nmanufacturers to be similar. The dependence of RICN with\nreverse bias observed in this research agrees qualitatively\nwith the hypothesis19 that, at high levels of negative bias, the\nelectric field in the oxide transports the electrons past the\ntrapped holes and thus RICN is limited in comparison with\nthat at lower levels of reverse bias. RICN is observed to\nincrease until the optimum because the processes of compen-\nsation and recombination are encouraged as electrons are\ntransported less rapidly, due to the falling electric field. Be-\nlow the optimum, however, electron transport appears to be\nincomplete as we approach the positive bias regime; thus\nRICN falls with further reductions in reverse bias below the\noptimum, until it eventually ceases completely at the extreme\nwhere transport is no longer reversed.\nThe correspondence of \u0001 with RICN cross section\nThe statistics of electron trapping are often considered\nby equating the rate of electron trapping with that of detrap-\nping via photon and phonon absorptions.

Redistribution subject to Afield reduces the energy depth of the trap center which raises\nthe significance of impact ionization and field ionization in\ndetrapping. These influences are often folded into the field\ndependence of the trapping cross section.23 In addition to\nCoulombic traps, which acquire charge carriers via tradi-\ntional charge-based attraction, neutral traps can arise from\nstrained molecular bonds in the oxide\u2019s atomic lattice. The\ncross section of these is likely to have a less-pronounced\nfield dependence because of the much shorter effective range\nof the potential of the neutral trap.24\nIn this work the maximum oxide electric field Eox was\n5\u0005105 V cm\u22121. Electron capture by Coulomb-attractive\noxide-charge centers, leading to recombination, is known to\nbe a strong function of the average oxide field.25 For Eox\n\b106 V cm\u22121 \u0001this case\u0002 the cross section for recombination\n\u0001r is known to vary approximately as Eox\n\u22123\/2\n. The data beyond\nthe point of optimum RICN \u0001for negative bias levels greater\nthan 3 V\u0002 do not exhibit even an approximate correspon-\ndence with this dependence. Instead a much reduced depen-\ndence of approximately Eox\n\u22121\/3 is observed. Clearly, a signifi-\ncant shortcoming of our work is that in this region there are\nvery few data. However, the inconsistency of the field depen-\ndence may support the possibility of a combined role of re-\ncombination and compensation in RICN, as opposed to that\nof recombination alone. Alternatively, the neutralization phe-\nnomenon may be due to the localized trapping of electrons in\nneutral traps, thus exhibiting the less pronounced field de-\npendence described above.\nReturning to Eq. \u00012\u0002 and considering RICN in terms of\nrecombination cross section \u0001r, we can draw correspondence\nwith the known dependence of this25 with threshold voltage\nchange Vt:\nVt =\nqNTTx\u00af\nKox\t0\n\u00031 \u2212 e\u2212\u0001rNinj\u0004 . \u00016\u0002\nHere NTT is the number of trap centers per unit area, x\u00af is the\ncentroid of the trap distribution, Kox is the static dielectric\nconstant of SiO2, Ninj is the number of electrons introduced\nper unit area, q is the charge of an electron, and \t0 is the\npermittivity of a vacuum. If Vt in Eq. \u00011\u0002 is considered as a\nsaturating quantity, i.e., Vt=\u0006\u00011\u2212e\u2212\u0007D\u0002, for comparison with\nEq. \u00016\u0002 where \u0007 is identical to that defined in Eq. \u00011\u0002, the\nfollowing proportionality can be inferred:\n\u0001NNinj\n \u0007D . \u00017\u0002\nHere correspondence is drawn with radiation dose being the\nsource of carriers as opposed to hot electron injection tech-\nniques.

Therefore \u0001N has been introduced in Eq. \u00017\u0002\nas the cross section for RICN, to reflect the combined role of\ncompensation and recombination of electrons and holes in\nthe oxide. Since it has been shown that \u0007 is a function of\noxide field, it follows that \u0001N will also exhibit a related de-\npendence, i.e., \u0001\u0001Eox\u0002 and \u0007\u0001Eox\u0002,\n\u0001N\u0001Eox\u0002 \n\n\u0007\u0001Eox\u0002D\nNinj\n. \u00018\u0002\nThus the experimental measurement of the dependence of \u0007\nwith reverse bias provides a qualitative means for character-\nizing the dependence of cross section for RICN with electric\nfield across the oxide.\nThe implications for dose measurement\nRICN is unlikely to be of use in mainstream dosimetry\nwith MOS devices. However, in extreme circumstances\nwhere switch-bias conditions arise, either inadvertently or\notherwise, the dependence of the neutralization of trapped\ncharge with reverse bias will be crucial if adjustments are\nsought to account for the effect of the exposure under reverse\nbias. This may, for example, be of particular value where\nMOS devices are inaccessible and cannot be replaced easily,\nsuch as in space. Furthermore, the possible independence of\noptimum RICN bias with primary dose suggests that allow-\nance for switch-bias effects could be made with reference to\nthis optimum recovery level and the dependence of \u0007 with\nbias reported in this research.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe dependence of RICN with reverse bias has been\nmeasured for doses consistent with therapeutic uses of these\ndevices, up to 20 Gy. Correspondence between the depen-\ndence of RICN with reverse bias and the dependence of neu-\ntralization cross section with oxide electric field has been\nmade. In summary, this work can be concluded as follows.\n\u00011\u0002 For high levels of negative bias, the degree of RICN\nfalls off to very low levels, consistent with the works of\nFleetwood19 and of Freitag et al.26\n\u00012\u0002 In the high-level, reverse bias extreme, the degree of\nRICN is very low but it is observed to be greater than\nthat for very low levels of reverse bias, i.e., for bias\nlevels greater than \u22121 V.\n\u00013\u0002 The dependence of RICN between \u22121 and \u22126 V is ob-\nserved to be nonlinear and a maximum is observed in\nthis region.\n\u00014\u0002 The reverse bias level at the optimum RICN is consis-\ntent with the region identified previously,19 correspond-\ning to the region in which the gradient of the threshold\nvoltage change versus reverse bias is maximized.\n\u00015\u0002 The observation that an optimum bias exists for RICN\nsuggests that it is at this point that the field due to the\noxide trap charge becomes greater than the applied gate\nbias. If this is the case, then charge transport at this\nDownloaded 27 Mar 2008 to 194.80.32.9. Redistribution subject to Aoptimum level must be small, due to the fields essen-\ntially canceling each other. Hence this provides further\nevidence for the location of the H+ ions responsible for\nmaking the interface traps being very near the Si\/SiO2\ninterface.\n\u00016\u0002 A proportional relationship exists between the cross-\nsection dependence of RICN with oxide field and that of\nthe experimental recovery parameter \u0007 observed as a\nresult of RICN measurements.\n\u00017\u0002 The dependence of RICN versus reverse bias follows an\nempirical dependence consistent with Eq. \u00012\u0002. More re-\nsearch is necessary to determine how primary dose in-\nfluences the reverse bias level associated with optimal\nRICN.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support and assistance of\nthe Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council\n\u0001EPSRC\u0002, the Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology, and the\nGeneral Organization for Technical Education and Voca-\ntional Training, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n1L.
