Introduction\n[2] It is becoming increasingly apparent from recent\nstudies that much of the NW European margin has experi-\nenced substantial vertical movements in Cenozoic time\n[e.g., Japsen and Chalmers, 2000; Dore\u00b4 et al., 2002]. A\nmajor global sea level regression began at the end of the\nCretaceous [Haq et al., 1987], followed by an episode of\nregional, thermally driven rock uplift linked to imposition of\nthe Iceland plume, and opening of the contemporary North\nAtlantic Ocean at \u000253 Ma [e.g., Nadin et al., 1997; Dore\u00b4 et\nal., 1999]. The exhumation associated with this thermal\nevent affected, to varying degrees, most areas of NW\nEurope, [e.g., Lovell and White, 1997; Jones et al., 2002].\n[3] Significant episodes of rock uplift and deformation\ncontinued from late Eocene to Miocene time [e.g., Japsen\nand Chalmers, 2000; Japsen et al., 2002; Rohrman et al.,\n2002]. This includes inferred post-early Eocene fault reac-\ntivation in SE Ireland [Cunningham et al., 2003], syn- and\npost-Oligocene inversion around the Irish-British Atlantic\nmargin [Roberts, 1989], and elongate inversion domes\noffshore central Norway [Dore\u00b4 et al., 1999]. Significant\ndoming in Scandinavia also occurred in the Neogene,\nfollowed and enhanced by rapid Plio-Pleistocene glacial\nerosion and isostatic rebound during interglacial periods\n[Riis and Fjeldskaar, 1992; Dore\u00b4 et al., 1999].\n[4] Many aspects of this Cenozoic activity however are\npoorly understood due to a discontinuous and poor Ceno-\nzoic stratigraphic record. This is particularly apparent on the\nIrish landmass where, apart from some scattered outcrops of\nCenozoic sediment across the island [Drew and Jones,\n2000], most of the direct onshore evidence for Cenozoic\ntectonic activity comes from NE Ireland (Figure 1). The\nTECTONICS, VOL. 23, TC6002, doi:10.1029\/2003TC001597, 2004\n1Now at Challenger Division for Seafloor Processes, Southampton\nOceanography Centre, Southampton, UK.\n2Deceased 1 November 2003.\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0278-7407\/04\/2003TC001597$12.00\nTC6002 1 of 17\nPaleocene\u2013early Eocene thermal event is associated with\nemplacement and displacements of dike swarms and sills\nmainly in the north and west of Ireland and extrusive\nvolcanism in the NE [Gibson et al., 1987; Mussett et al.,\n1988; Meighan et al., 1999]. During the Oligocene, dextral\ntranstension of NW trending faults in NE Ireland and the\nIrish Sea (e.g., the Newry\u2013Codling Faults, Figure 1)\nresulted in the creation of the Lough Neagh-Ballymoney\npull-apart basins [George, 1967; Parnell et al., 1988;\nNaylor, 1992; Geoffroy et al., 1996; Meighan et al.,\n1999]. The general picture that emerges from the onshore\nstratigraphic record and recent apatite fission track studies\n[Green et al., 2000; Allen et al., 2002; Cunningham et al.,\n2003] is of a broad patchwork of repeated episodes of\nexhumation, mostly restricted to the high areas around the\nmargins of the island, with a low-relief erosion surface\noccupying much of central Ireland (Figure 1).\n[5] On the basis of vitrinite reflectance profiles [e.g.,\nCorcoran and Clayton, 2001], apatite fission track analysis\n[Lewis et al., 1992; Green et al., 1997] and sonic velocity\nlogs [Ware and Turner, 2002], the Irish Sea region experi-\nenced 1 to 3 km of denudation during the Paleocene. In\nFigure 1. (a) Onshore geology and topography of Ireland and major Mesozoic-Cenozoic offshore\nbasins. Study area is shown by the gray box in SE Ireland.

See color\nversion of this figure at back of this issue.\nTC6002 CUNNINGHAM ET AL.: CENOZOIC ACTIVITY, SE IRELAND\n2 of 17\nTC6002\ncontrast, the offshore Cenozoic stratigraphic record west of\nIreland is mostly intact, with major tectonic activity mostly\ncomprising rifting, and Cenozoic exhumation and deforma-\ntion [Cook, 1987; Naylor and Anstey, 1987; Roberts, 1989;\nShannon, 1991; Naylor, 1992; O\u2019Driscoll et al., 1995;\nShannon et al., 1995; Vogt, 1995; Stoker, 1997]. Allen et\nal. [2002] showed that the total volumetric discharge of\nsediment in the Cenozoic is an order of magnitude\nsmaller than the preserved solid volume of Cenozoic\nsediment in the basins offshore western Ireland. Therefore\nthe Cenozoic evolution of Ireland must be seen against the\nbroader development of the NW European continental\nmargin.\n[6] In this contribution, we show evidence for potential\nCenozoic tectonic activity in SE Ireland, which is consis-\ntent with observations from other parts of the NW Euro-\npean margin. We first identify tectonic activity on both\npreviously unrecognized faults and reactivated Caledonian\nand Variscan structures by examining a range of geomor-\nphic indicators of tectonics. We use offshore bathymetric\nand geophysical data to relate these structures to the\ninverted Mesozoic Kish Bank Basin off the east coast of\nIreland. We then describe onshore evidence of brittle\ndeformation from adjacent areas of the northern margin\nof the Leinster Granite (Figure 1) that allows us to partially\nconstrain the kinematics of the deformation. Finally, we\ndiscuss our structural observations with regards to their\nlikely age and potential geodynamic mechanisms driving\nthis deformation.\n2. Regional Setting\n[7] The relationship between the topography and surface\ngeology outcrop pattern of Ireland shows oldest rocks\nforming areas of highest relief and elevation (Figure 1).\nThe only exception to this pattern being the Paleocene-\nEocene granite of the Mourne Mountains (Co. Louth and\nCo. Down) (Figure 1). In many cases, rocks of uniform\nlithology underlie a wide range of local relief, and therefore\nareas of relative high relief cannot be explained solely by\ndifferential erosion (e.g., enhanced denudation rates of\nsofter rock).\n[8] The Irish landscape has been extensively modified by\nQuaternary glaciers leading to incised U-shaped valleys,\ncorries and glacial depositional features [McCabe, 1996].\nHowever, Mitchell [1980] described evidence for the pres-\nervation of extensive preglacial weathering features and\nsuggested that much of the present-day landscape is the\nproduct of tectonism, modified by glaciers. Since the end of\nglaciation in Ireland (circa 10 ka), there has been a relative\nrise of base level, leading to the drowning of drumlins,\neskers and moraines [Gray and Coxon, 1991; Coxon,\n2001a].\n[9] The present form of the lower Paleozoic inliers and\nlandforms of central and southern Ireland are most likely\ndue to differential erosion between the softer, chemically\nweathered Carboniferous limestone surface and the more\nresistant metasedimentary Silurian-Devonian cores [Dewey,\n2000; Drew and Jones, 2000; Taylor, 2002; Simms, 2004]\n(Figure 1). However, with the notable exception of these\ninliers, the main areas of relatively high relief tend to\noccupy the periphery of the island.\n[10] The central portion of the Irish landmass has very\nlow relief. Allen et al. [2002] used apatite fission track\nmodeling to infer that this area experienced little denuda-\ntion, with slight local subsidence, during much of the\nCenozoic. In general, the area is underlain by Lower\nCarboniferous carbonate rocks and is cut by a major erosion\nsurface. The low-relief surface extends across part of the\nLeinster Granite of southeast Ireland [Cunningham et al.,\n2003] (Figure 1). The presence of nonmarine Oligocene-\nMiocene clays at Loughshinney [Drew and Jones, 2000],\nMiocene-lower Pliocene nonmarine clays at Hollymount\n[Boulter, 1980; Watts, 1985], Pliocene clays at Tynagh\n[Monaghan and Scannell, 1991], and Pliocene Aeolian\nsands, lignites and fossilized paleokarstic landforms at\nPollnahalia [Coxon and Coxon, 1997] suggests that much\nof the low-relief land surface is no older than Oligocene\n(Figure 1).\n3. Tectonic Geomorphology\n[11] SE Ireland contains the largest contiguous area of\nhigh topography on the island (Figure 1). The region is\ndominated by the Wicklow and Blackstairs Mountains.\nTopographically, the mountains form a broad, gently rolling\nupland. The eastern side displays a stepped topography\ndissected in places by glacially incised valleys up to\n200 m deep. The western side slopes more uniformly\nwestward. The topographic massifs of the Wicklow and\nBlackstairs Mountains do not coincide with the margins\nof the Leinster Granite (Figures 1 and 2). Plutons of\nthe Leinster Granite are continuous beneath the low-relief\nTullow Lowland and are capped with isolated roof\npendants of Ordovician schist [Charlesworth, 1963; Bru\u00a8ck\nand O\u2019Connor, 1980] at both high and low elevations.\nCunningham et al. [2003] used apatite fission track data\nand geomorphological analysis to infer that the Tullow\nLowland has been downthrown to the south by about\n700 m in post-early Eocene time. Therefore the differences\nin elevation across SE Ireland cannot be due simply to\ndifferential erosion [Farrington, 1927; Davies, 1966].\n[12] The topography of a region (e.g., spatial patterns of\nelevation and relief, spatial variations in catchment size\nand relief, map-view patterns of rivers, and river longitu-\ndinal profiles) reflects the time-integrated effects of both\ntectonic and climatic activity. The eastern side of the\nWicklow Mountains is marked by a stepped topography\ndominated by two relatively planar surfaces that gently dip\nwestward, here termed the Djouce and Vartry surfaces\n(Figure 3).\n3.1. Djouce Surface\n[13] The Djouce surface forms a relatively high plateau\nmostly underlain by Leinster Granite (Figure 3). The surface\nhas a modal elevation of 450 m with highest elevations\nin the east. The bedrock surface dips gently to the\nwest and is incised along the Lough Dan\u2013Tay Fault,\nTC6002 CUNNINGHAM ET AL.: CENOZOIC ACTIVITY, SE IRELAND\n3 of 17\nTC6002\nwhich separates the Lugnaquillia and Northern plutons\n(Figure 2). Cunningham et al. [2003] inferred a post-\nearly Eocene displacement on the Lough Dan-Tay Fault\nof 250 m, downthrown to the east. Along the NW\ntrending portion of the fault there is an apparent right-\nlateral separation of \u0002500 m on the eastern margin of the\ngranite.\n3.2. Vartry Surface\n[14] The Vartry surface varies in width from 4 to\n10 km, has a modal elevation of 230 m and extends\nsome 20 km from the Dargle River in the north to the\nAvonmore River in the south (Figure 3a). The surface\nslopes toward the west, away from the coast, at 1\u0002\u20132\u0002.\nMany of the bedrock outcrops exposed on the Vartry\nsurface show deep red staining, alteration of bedrock\nalong joints to red and yellow clay and disaggregation\nof the underlying greywacke and quartzite. These features\nprovide evidence for paleosol formation under prolonged\nperiods of warm and wet climate [Mitchell, 1980;\nWilkinson et al., 1980; Mitchell and Ryan, 1997; Coxon,\n2001b]. The lack of compaction of this material and of\nthe red breccias show that it has never been buried to any\ngreat depth.\n3.3. Topographic Escarpments\n[15] The Djouce surface is separated from the lower\nVartry surface by an abrupt, steep linear escarpment with\n200 to 250 m relief, here informally named the West Vartry\nescarpment. The escarpment trend is oblique to the strike\nof the underlying Cambrian-Lower Ordovician phyllites\nand metamorphic aureole rocks of the Ribband Group\n(Figure 3a). Along the foot of the escarpment there are a\nnumber of outcrops of very coarse red breccias with a clay\nmatrix and angular boulders of vein quartz and phyllite up\nto 1 m in diameter (Figure 3a). Likewise, the Vartry surface\nis bounded on its eastern margin by a second escarpment,\nhere termed the East Vartry escarpment, that steps down to\nthe east with \u0002100 to 300 m of relief. Again, the escarp-\nment trend is oblique to the strike of the underlying\nCambrian greywackes (Figure 3a).\n[16] The East and West Vartry escarpments cut across\nboth lithological contacts and the Caledonian structural\ngrain (Figure 3a).

The relatively erodible greywackes\nform areas of low relief and elevation, while aureole rocks\nand quartzites generally produce steep slopes and areas of\nrelatively high relief (Figure 3c). This implies that landscape\nevolution is partly controlled by differential erosion. How-\never, the greywackes of the Bray Group atypically underlie\nthe steepest slopes in the Vartry area, e.g., at Bray Head and\nalong the East Vartry escarpment (Figures 3b and 3c). It is\ntherefore unlikely that the escarpments are a product of\nresistant bedrock. The steepness of the walls implies that the\nhillslope gradients are being actively maintained by fluvial\nincision in response to base level fall [e.g., Densmore et al.,\n1997].\n3.4. Fluvial Geomorphology\n[17] The Vartry surface is drained by (1) a series of small\ncatchments that flow to the east, across the East Vartry\nescarpment and (2) the Vartry River, which flows south\nalong the long axis of the surface before turning abruptly\neast (Figure 4). Each of these streams has incised a steep-\nwalled, bedrock gorge across the East Vartry escarpment;\nthe depth of each gorge is partly related to the drainage area\nof the catchment, and varies from 25 m for the smallest\ncatchments to 120 m for the Vartry River, which forms the\nspectacular Devil\u2019s Glen (Figure 4). Longitudinal profiles of\nthe rivers that cross the East Vartry escarpment show\nbedrock knickpoints of between 25 and 120 m, consistent\nwith a fall in base level relative to the headwaters of each\ncatchment.\n3.5. Interpretation\n[18] As noted above, the escarpments are unlikely to be\ndue to differential erosion. The elevation of bedrock at the\nbase of the East Vartry escarpment varies from 20 to\n140 m, which is inconsistent with a possible origin as a\nsea cliff. Marine or glacial erosion processes of the East\nVartry escarpment do not explain the westward tilt of the\nVartry surface, nor its sharp southern termination, just\nsouth of the Devil\u2019s Glen (Figure 4). Davies [1966] argued\nthat the Vartry surface was a series of subaerial pediments\ncut into bedrock, but this explanation fails to explain the\nlimited spatial extent of the surface, its westward tilt, and\nthe abrupt escarpments at its eastern and western margins.\nTherefore it is likely that the knickpoints on the East\nVartry escarpment are due to faulting. The occurrence of\nred breccias along the West Vartry escarpment likewise\nimplies faulting. Hence we interpret the escarpments as the\nFigure 4.

These structures are\nsubparallel to the Bray Fault that lies between 1 and\n5 km offshore to the east (Figure 5).\n[19] South of the Devil\u2019s Glen, the East Vartry escarp-\nment is segmented en echelon and changes strike from NE\nto ENE. The change in strike corresponds with two known\nCaledonian faults that appear to have offset the escarpment.\nThe Callowhill fault sinistrally offsets the escarpment by\n\u00021.7 km (as measured by offset of the 200 m contour), and\nthe maximum topographic elevation is 80 m higher on the\nsouth side of the fault. Sinistral offset of the escarpment\nacross the Southeastern Boundary fault is \u00022.7 km, and the\nmaximum elevation is 120 m higher on the south side\n(Figure 5). This implies almost identical sinistral transpres-\nsional kinematics on both structures, each with a strike-slip\nto dip-slip ratio of \u000220:1.\n[20] These relationships imply that dip-slip motion oc-\ncurred along the eastern margin of the Wicklow Mountains,\ndisplacement being taken up by faults that form the West\nand East Vartry escarpments and that are subparallel to the\noffshore Bray Fault. During or after this deformation,\nsinistral transpressional displacement occurred along NE\ntrending, reactivated Caledonian structures (Figure 5). Be-\nlow, we describe geophysical evidence for activity along the\noffshore continuation of these structures in the Kish Bank\nBasin.\n4. Offshore Structures in the Kish Bank\nBasin, Irish Sea\n[21] To the east of the Wicklow and Blackstairs Moun-\ntains, between 2 and 10 km offshore (Figure 6a), Upper\nCarboniferous and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks are pre-\nserved in a down-faulted outlier, the Kish Bank Basin. The\nbasin is thought to represent the erosional remnant of a\nlarger, linked Mesozoic basin system that covered much of\nthe Irish Sea and western Britain [e.g., Dunford et al., 2001]\nand probably extended into the north of Ireland as shown by\nonshore successions near the Kingscourt Outlier [Visscher,\n1971; Naylor et al., 1993] and the Ulster Basin, Co. Antrim\n[Manning and Wilson, 1975]. Within the basin, a thick\nPermo-Triassic package unconformably overlies Westpha-\nlian rocks [e.g., Jenner, 1981; Naylor et al., 1993; Corcoran\nand Clayton, 2001; Dunford et al., 2001]. The bulk of the\nextension occurred during Permo-Triassic times [Shannon,\n1991; Naylor et al., 1993; Dunford et al., 2001]. Interpre-\ntation of vitrinite reflectance profiles (Shell 33\/22-1) from\nUpper Carboniferous sequences (Figure 6a) indicates that\nbetween \u00021.5 km [Corcoran and Clayton, 2001] and 3 km\n[Jenner, 1981] of section has been removed.\n[22] The basin is divided in two parts by the NNW\ntrending Codling Fault. The fault zone is 2 to 5 km wide\nand dextrally offsets the Dalkey and Lambay faults by\n\u00024 km [Broughan et al., 1989] (Figures 6a and 6c). Recent\nseismic studies suggest that as much as 9 km of strike-slip\ndisplacement has occurred during the Cenozoic [Dunford et\nal., 2001]. Thickening of Neogene-Quaternary sediments is\nobservable on seismic profiles and 381 m were encountered\nin well Fina 33\/17-1. The base of the Neogene-Quaternary\nsection has been tentatively dated as lower Pliocene from\npoor miospore recoveries [Naylor et al., 1993]. On the basis\nof similar orientation and sense of displacement, a number\nof previous workers have suggested that the Codling Fault\nis aligned with the dextral-normal Newry Fault in NE\nIreland (see Figure 9 for location), which is known to have\nbeen active in syn- and post-Oligocene time [Charlesworth,\n1963; George, 1967; Jenner, 1981; Kerr, 1987; Parnell et\nal., 1988; Readman et al., 1997; Geoffroy et al., 1996].\n[23] The NNW trending Bray Fault is parallel to the\nCodling Fault, and lies \u00021 km offshore from Bray Head.\nThis fault brings Cambrian rocks against Lias. Broughan et\nal. [1989] suggested that as much as 2.7 km of Liassic and\nyounger section may be preserved in the hanging wall of the\nBray Fault (Figure 6a). On the basis of known thicknesses\nof missing Mesozoic and lower to upper Paleozoic strati-\nFigure 5.

In this\nmodel, NNW striking faults, parallel to the Bray Fault,\nare assumed to be dextral transtensional structures,\nwhereas those faults oriented N\u2013S (e.g., the East and\nWest Vartry faults) are primarily extensional.

Interpretation of seismic reflection profiles\nand aeromagnetic data shows that the postulated Lias\nsection pinches out to the east and is faulted (northern\nmargin of Wicklow High block) against Triassic rocks to the\nsoutheast (Figure 6a).\n4.1. Bathymetry\n[24] Water depths just west of the Codling Fault are on\naverage 50 to 70 m (Figure 6b). To the east, the fault\nzone forms an east facing scarp on the seabed, with a\nmaximum bathymetric relief of \u000280 m (Figures 6b\nand 6c). Recent multibeam bathymetric surveys have\nimaged the surface morphology of the fault zone and\nshow strong variation in scarp relief along the structure\n(Figure 6c). There is no seismic reflection evidence of\nTriassic synrift sedimentation [e.g., Naylor et al., 1993].\nHence the fault zone was not active during Triassic\nrifting. Dextral transtensional displacements are therefore\nCenozoic. This is supported by the presence of active gas\nseepage along the fault trace [Corcoran and Clayton,\n1999] and microseismic activity in 1982. Toward the\nnorthern end of the Codling Fault, water depths attain a\nmaximum of 150 m within the bathymetric Lambay Deep\n(Figures 6b and 6c). The deep is oriented NNW-SSE and\nis <1 km by <0.5 km in dimension. A similar, NNW\ntrending bathymetric feature occurs \u000210 km east of\nthe Vartry surface along the Bray Fault (Figure 6b).\nWater depths in the deep reach a maximum of 120 m\nin contrast with \u000220 to 40 m on adjacent shelf areas.\nBoth bathymetric deeps have length to width ratios of\n\u00023:1 and are located where the Codling and Bray Faults\nswing to a more northerly strike (Figure 6b). We interpret\ntheir formation as the product of dextral transtension,\nproducing localized extension where the fault strands are\nin a favorable northerly strike.\n4.2. High-Resolution Aeromagnetic Data\n[25] The shallow structure of the Kish Bank Basin is\nwell imaged by a pseudodepth slice filtered high-resolution\nmagnetic intensity map (Figure 7). The magnetic image\nshows thick basin fill and deep basement as regions of\nrelatively low magnetic intensities. At the southern margin\nof the basin, magnetic intensities are relatively high and\nthus depict areas of shallow basement. This was proven by\nShell 33\/22-1 well that encountered a thin Neogene-\nQuaternary section (71 m) overlying 720 m of Upper\nCarboniferous (Westphalian) succession, unconformably\nresting on basement of lower Paleozoic slate. The lower\nPaleozoic slates have previously been correlated with the\nnear onshore Bray Group (Figure 6a) [Jenner, 1981;\nNaylor et al., 1993].\n[26] High magnetic intensity anomalies correspond with\nthe known Ordovician basic volcanic rocks on Lambay\nIsland (LI on Figure 7). A negative anomaly (PI on\nFigure 7) occurs just east of the Codling Fault, about\n6 km south of the Lambay Deep. The high intensity of the\nanomaly suggests it is probably an igneous intrusion. The\nanomaly is elliptical in plan view with the long axis\noriented parallel to the Codling Fault. The axis swings\nfrom a NNW to NNE orientation at the northern end of the\nbody. The clockwise swing, subtle S-shape geometry and\nparallelism of the axis with the Codling Fault implies that\nthe intrusion is syntectonic. As outlined in section 1, there\nwas much igneous activity during the Paleogene, and the\nCodling Fault was active at this time [e.g., Charlesworth,\n1963; Naylor et al., 1993]. The intrusion displays reverse\npolarity, which is typical of Paleogene dikes, sills and lava\nflows in Ireland and Britain [e.g., Saunders et al., 1997].\nThus we infer that the anomaly is most likely a Paleogene\nigneous intrusion related to the North Atlantic Igneous\nTertiary Province.\n[27] Directional filtering of the pseudodepth sliced\nmagnetic image enhances relatively shallow magnetic\nlineaments (Figure 7). The Codling, Lambay, and Dalkey\nfaults are delineated by subtle changes in lineament\npattern and by sharp, discontinuous linear anomalies\nabove the fault zones. Shallow anomalies north of the\naxis of the Wicklow High basement ridge are dominantly\nFigure 7. Total magnetic intensity image of the Kish Bank\nBasin. Image area is the same as in Figures 6a and 6b, and\nfault traces are overlain for comparison. Magnetic intensity\nis reduced to pole with a pseudo depth slice filter applied.\nThe filter accentuates high-frequency, low-amplitude shal-\nlow magnetic structure. Note trends in major magnetic\nlineaments indicated by thin lines (see section 4.2 for full\ndiscussion). Abbreviations are as follows: BrF, Bray Fault;\nCF, Callowhill Fault; LI, Lambay Island; PI, Intrusion;\nSEBF, Southeastern Boundary Fault; WH, Wicklow High.\nSee color version of this figure at back of this issue.\nTC6002 CUNNINGHAM ET AL.: CENOZOIC ACTIVITY, SE IRELAND\n9 of 17\nTC6002\nnorth or NE trending. South of the ridge axis, the\ndominant lineament trend changes to ENE, indicating\nthe potential presence of a significant structural break\nassociated with the southern margin of the Wicklow High\n(Figure 7). Small z-shaped sigmoidal changes of magnetic\nlineament are observable along the southern margin of the\nHigh and may suggest the presence of a fault with a\ncomponent of left-lateral displacement. This sense of\ndisplacement is consistent with the same Cenozoic stress\nfield that has driven slip on both the Codling and Newry\nfault systems. On the basis of this evidence, we tenta-\ntively interpret the fault bounding the southern and\nnorthern margin of the Wicklow High as being coupled\nwith the dextral-normal Codling Fault. The intersection\nangle of the faults is >60\u0002, suggesting sinistral trans-\npression. When traced onshore, the faults correlate with\nthe onshore Callowhill and Southeastern Boundary faults\n(Figure 7).\n5. Brittle-Ductile Structures in the Northern\nLeinster Granite\n[28] A corollary of near-offshore Cenozoic faults is the\npotential for tracing such structures onshore and the poten-\ntial for reactivation of preexisting shear zones. To test this\nhypothesis, we mapped structures cutting onshore outcrops\nalong the northern margin of the Leinster Granite.\n[29] Brindley [1954] recognized three important phases\nof deformation along the northern margin of the Leinster\nGranite, categorized as (1) primary flow textures; (2)\nprimary fracture features (e.g., pegmatite-aplite dike sys-\nFigure 8.

Locality 2 is dominated by NNW-SSE\nstructures with sinistral sense of shear (shown as \u2018\u2018i\u2019\u2019 on the stereonets).

The \u2018\u2018later mechanical features\u2019\u2019 were previously\ndescribed as postconsolidation effects in the form of\nmarginal zones of shearing [Brindley, 1954] and include\nboth brittle fracture systems and ductile textures. On steeply\ninclined foliation surfaces, Brindley [1954] observed inter-\ngranular deformation associated with the development of\nsecondary muscovite along the surfaces.\n[30] In this study, detailed remapping along the northern\nmargin of the Leinster Granite reveals three sets of post-\nCaledonian structures associated with shear zones, all part\nof Brindley\u2019s \u2018\u2018later mechanical features,\u2019\u2019 that postdate\ngranite emplacement. These structures are distinguished\non the basis of orientation, kinematics, deformational style\nand overprinting relationships (Figure 8).\n5.1. Brittle-Ductile NNW-SSE Sinistral Shear Zones\n[31] On the northern margin of the Leinster Granite,\nsynmagmatic fabrics are offset by NNW-SSE striking,\nnear-vertical deformation zones (group \u2018\u2018i\u2019\u2019 data on\nFigure 8). These structures are observed around the entire\nnorthern margin of the batholith and are particularly prom-\ninent at localities 2 and 3 (Figure 8). The shear zones form\n1\u20135 m wide bands spaced about 30 m apart, and display\na well-developed, moderately east dipping foliation. Kine-\nmatic indicators on the margins of the shear zones predom-\ninantly show a sinistral strike-slip sense of shear and include\nasymmetrical S-C fabrics and offset pegmatite dikes. In\nplaces, slickensides and striae pitch steeply to the south on\nnear-vertical planes, consistent with up to the east sense of\nshear. The shear zones at localities 2 and 3 are geometrically\nand kinematically identical. Therefore we correlate these\nstructures as part of the same shear zone.\n5.2. Semibrittle WSW-ENE to WNW-ESE\nDextral-Reverse Shear Zones\n[32] The WSW-ENE trending Blackrock Fault is parallel\nto the Caledonian fabric on the NW margin of the Leinster\nGranite and lower Paleozoic aureole rocks. The fault swings\nto a WNW-ESE trend where it reaches the coastline, and\ndextral-reverse shear zones are intensely developed adjacent\nto the fault (group [ii] data on Figure 8). The deformation is\nbrittle in nature, with the Leinster Granite thrust northward\nover the Vise\u00b4an limestones of the Dublin Basin.\n[33] The shear zones are observed in coastal sections and\nhave a consistent WNW-ESE strike at localities 1 and 2\n(Figure 8). The main fault zone lies offshore with smaller\nsplays on the shear zone margin exposed onshore. In plan\nview, the WNW-ESE shear zones form an anastomosing\nnetwork enclosing lenticular lozenges of less-deformed\ngranite. Since much of the outcrop is restricted to coastal\nsections, the shear zone margins are rarely exposed. These\nstructures offset the NNW-SSE sinistral shear zones de-\nscribed in section 5.1.\n[34] The mesoscopic structures that comprise these shear\nzones of the Blackrock Fault typify semibrittle deformation.\nWe interpret the bulk deformation of the shear zones as a\nprogressive dextral shear based on the following observa-\ntions. First, sigmoidal \u2018\u2018fish,\u2019\u2019 with length to width ratios of\nabout 2:1, possess an S-shape geometry and are exposed\non semivertical surfaces, showing consistent dextral-re-\nverse (top to the north) kinematics (Figure 8). Second,\nsigmoidal foliation has a mean strike of \u0002090\u0002 and the\nfinite plane or line of transport trends \u0002110\u0002. This reflects\na progressive deformation where increments of infinitesi-\nmal strain produce C-planes that are subsequently de-\nformed, displaying consistent dextral kinematics. Finally,\na lozenge-shaped band of cataclasite, up to 2 m thick and\nstriking WNW-ESE, is exposed near Seapoint (locality 1b,\nFigure 7). Relict granitic clasts within a fine-grained\nmatrix show crude sigmoidal S- and Z-geometries on a\nsubhorizontal surface.\n[35] A breccia is exposed about 300 m to the west at\nlocality 1a (Figure 8), on the Blackrock Fault contact\nbetween the Leinster Granite and Carboniferous limestones.\nThe fault breccia is notably angular, with pieces of granite\n(up to 30 cm in diameter) and occasional limestone and\nshale clasts set in a brecciated groundmass. The clasts are\naligned on an E-W striking pressure solution cleavage and\ntheir long axes plunge at about 20\u0002 to the east. The cleavage\nsteepens from a dip of 50\u0002 SW to 80\u0002 NE and swings\nclockwise in strike toward the fault. This indicates a\npredominantly dextral shear on the Blackrock Fault with a\ncomponent of upthrow on the south side.\n5.3. NW-SE Brittle Dextral-Normal Shear Zones\n[36] A younger set of shear zones cut the NNW-SSE\nsinistral shear bands at localities 2 and 3 (group [iii]\nstructures on Figure 8) and offset the WNW-ESE structures\nat locality 2. These structures trend NW-SE and dip between\n60\u0002 and 84\u0002 to the NE. Individual zones range from a few\nmeters to more than 100 m in width, and can be traced\nfor tens of meters along strike. Two zones at locality 3\n(Figure 8) contain S-shaped sigmoidal quartz veins and\ncataclasite with rotated porphyroclasts, indicating dextral\nshear. A stretching lineation on the shear zone walls at\nlocality 3 plunges moderately to the SE and is consistent\nwith dextral-normal shear (down to the east). We speculate\nthat these structures are the onshore continuation of the\nBray Fault (see section 6).\n5.4. Evidence of Timing for Onshore Structures\n[37] The WNW-ESE dextral and NNW-SSE sinistral\nshear zones are compatible with a NW directed maximum\nhorizontal compression. A pressure solution cleavage is\nconfined to the NNW-SSE sinistral shear zones and defor-\nmational style is brittle-ductile. It is possible that the NNW-\nSSE sinistral shear zones are reidal shears to the WNW-ESE\ndextral semi brittle structures. However, Late Carboniferous\nto Early Permian Variscan deformation [Graham, 2001] of\nthe Vise\u00b4an rocks of the Dublin Basin consists of E-W\ntrending fold arrays in the northern part of the basin, related\nto NW-SE dextral shear zones and N-S trending sinistral\nshear zones [Johnston, 1993]. The WNW-ESE dextral-\nreverse structures, on the northern margin of the granite,\noffset the NNW-SSE sinistral shear zones (Figure 8).\nTherefore it is likely that the NNW-SSE sinistral shear\nzones are the product of Variscan deformation.\nTC6002 CUNNINGHAM ET AL.: CENOZOIC ACTIVITY, SE IRELAND\n11 of 17\nTC6002\n[38] The WNW-ESE dextral-reverse shear zones of the\nBlackrock Fault are notable for their brittle cataclastic\ntextures where, at the coast, the fault changes strike from\nENE-WSW to WNW-ESE. In general, large quartz grains\ndisplay undulose extinction with partial polygonization.\nSecondary growth of muscovite has facilitated cataclastic\nflow, as the micas have been smeared out along the planes\nof the original magmatic foliation. The breccia at locality 1a\nlies along the Blackrock Fault and contains angular blocks\nof granite set in a fine-grained cataclastic matrix with rare\nclasts of Vise\u00b4an shale and limestone. The Vise\u00b4an clasts\nshow that the breccia is not of Caledonian origin [Brindley,\n1957] and can be no older than Variscan in age.\n[39] Vitrinite reflectance data indicate that, during Varis-\ncan deformation (Upper Carboniferous to Lower Permian),\nVise\u00b4an limestones cropping out in the Dublin region\nreached peak paleotemperatures of \u0002350\u0002C in a geothermal\ngradient of \u000250\u0002C km\u00041 [Clayton et al., 1989]. The known\nthickness of limestone in the contemporary Dublin Basin is\nabout 2.5 km. The granite outcrops currently exposed along\nthe northern margin of the batholith lay about 0.5 km below\nthe Carboniferous unconformity [e.g., Graham, 2001], and\ntherefore must have attainted temperatures of at least 400\u0002C\nduring Variscan deformation. As the brittle-ductile transition\nfor quartz occurs at about 300\u0002C [Kerrich et al., 1977;\nBarker, 1998], the presence of unpolygonized quartz grains\nargues that the WNW-ESE dextral-reverse shear zones\nrepresent post-Variscan deformation.\n[40] The Blackrock Fault, in places, forms a topographic\nescarpment between the lower Paleozoic inlier and the\npostulated Oligocene erosion surface (see section 2 above).\nTherefore, while not conclusive, it may be tentatively\ninferred from this evidence that reactivation of the Black-\nrock Fault is of at least Oligocene age as is the erosional\nsurface.\n[41] The youngest structures, on the NE margin of the\nbatholith, are NW trending shear zones that offset both\nearlier sets of structures. The kinematics of the structures are\nconsistent with dextral-normal (down to the east) displace-\nment, and lie approximately along strike from the offshore\nBray Fault (Figure 8).\n6. Discussion\n6.1. Geomorphological Constraints\n[42] The presence of knickpoints on the rivers draining\nthe Vartry surface implies that insufficient time has passed\nsince knickpoint generation for the rivers to re-achieve\nequilibrium long profiles. With a base level fall caused by\na drop in sea level or by an increment of tectonic displace-\nment along a river that is in equilibrium with its boundary\nconditions, a wave of incision will propagate upstream from\nthe locus of base level change. The adjustment timescale ta\nreflects the time necessary for this wave to reach the\nupstream reaches of the catchment. For times t < ta, the\nriver will appear to be out of equilibrium; a knickpoint will\nseparate reaches of the river that have equilibrated (through\nincision) from those that have not. For t > ta, the river will\nappear to be in equilibrium with its new boundary con-\nditions. Thus the presence of knickpoints in the catchments\ndraining the Vartry surface argues that the most recent\ndisturbance on those catchments must have occurred less\nthan ta years ago. In addition, the spatial correspondence\nbetween the knickpoints and the East Vartry escarpment\nimplies that the knickpoints have not had enough time to\nmigrate significant distances upstream.\n[43] In general, rates of knickpoint migration are not\nwell documented, particularly in relation to faulting.\nNevertheless, the presence of knickpoints on the East Vartry\nescarpment places some constraint on the timing of\nknickpoint generation. Pazzaglia et al. [1998] and Young\nand McDougall [1993] have independently shown that\nknickpoints may survive on catchments draining passive\nmargins for \u000210 Myr. Pazzaglia et al. [1998] demonstrated\nthat knickpoints in the modern bed of the Susquehanna\nRiver, a large catchment in the eastern United States, were\nvisible in the profile of a fluvial terrace dated to \u000210 Ma.\nYoung and McDougall [1993] compared modern profiles of\nsmall catchments in New South Wales, Australia, with\npaleoprofiles preserved by a basalt flow, and demonstrated\nthat knickpoints and profile irregularities were not removed\nin 20 Myr. These results, while not directly applicable to SE\nIreland, do suggest that the knickpoints along the East\nVartry escarpment may have persisted for \u000210\u201320 Myr,\nor possibly longer.\n6.2. Onshore-Offshore Correlation and Timing\n[44] The escarpments that bound the eastern margins of\nthe Djouce and Vartry surfaces are interpreted as the surface\nexpression of Cenozoic faults. Displacements on these\nfaults, which we informally refer to as the East and West\nVartry faults, must be relatively recent to explain the\nexistence of knickpoints, the discordance between foliation\nand topography, the occurrence of reddened fault breccias,\nand the lack of compaction in these breccias (particularly as\napatite fission track modeling predicts large amounts of\nexhumation during Cenozoic time [Allen et al., 2002]). The\nEast and West Vartry faults are subparallel to the offshore\ndextral-normal, post-Liassic Bray Fault and post-Oligocene\nCodling Fault (Figures 5 and 6). Like the offshore struc-\ntures, the onshore faults have a down to the east sense of\nvertical displacement. Likewise, the NW-SE dextral-normal\nshear zones on the NE margin of the Leinster Granite at\nlocality 3 lie approximately along strike of the Bray Fault\n(Figure 8). If we make the assumptions, on the basis of\ngeometry, kinematics, and occurrence of bathymetric deeps,\nthat (1) the Bray Fault was reactivated by the same stress\nsystem which has driven late Cenozoic offsets on the\nCodling Fault and (2) the Vartry faults and the onshore\nshear zones at locality 3 are part of the same fault zone as\nthe Bray Fault, then displacement on the Vartry faults and\nthe locality 3 shear zones are at most post-Liassic, and\nprobably post-Oligocene, in age.\n[45] The aeromagnetic data show two major faults\nbounding the offshore Wicklow High block can be\nextended westward to the onshore Callowhill and\nSoutheastern Boundary faults (Figures 5 and 7; described in\nsection 4.2 above). These faults, in turn, have been inter-\nTC6002 CUNNINGHAM ET AL.: CENOZOIC ACTIVITY, SE IRELAND\n12 of 17\nTC6002\npreted as the northern extension of the southeast\ndipping, Caledonian-age, ductile East Carlow Deformation\nZone (ECDZ; Figure 9) [McArdle and Kennedy, 1985;\nMcArdle et al., 1987]. Cunningham et al. [2003] sug-\ngested, on the basis of apatite fission track data and\ngeomorphology, that the ECDZ was reactivated post-early\nEocene time. The Callowhill and Southeastern Boundary\nfaults clearly displace the East Vartry fault, and correlation\nwith the ECDZ suggests that this displacement also took\nplace in post-early Eocene time. This timing is further\nconstrained by (1) the Blackrock Fault offset of the\npostulated Oligocene surface to the north (see section 2),\n(2) known post-Oligocene deformation on the Codling\nFault, and (3) the occurrence of knickpoints along the\nEast Vartry fault.\n6.3. Tectonic Model\n[46] We infer that evidence for two separate Cenozoic\ndeformation events are preserved in SE Ireland. The first led\nto reactivation of the Caledonian\u2013Variscan Blackrock Fault\nFigure 9. Summary shaded relief image of NW Europe showing Cenozoic structures in Ireland and\nBritain, extensional graben in the Alpine foreland, and compression on the Faeroe-Rockall Plateau\n[Coward et al., 1989; Boldreel and Andersen, 1998; Cunningham et al., 2003; Parnell et al., 1988]. Also\nshown are generalized areas of Neogene uplift and subsidence [after Japsen and Chalmers, 2000]. Thick\nblack arrows show the mean maximum compressive horizontal stress (Shmax) [Mu\u00a8ller et al., 1992, 1997].\nInset shows post-early Eocene proposed paleostress directions for SE Ireland (symbols after Sibson\n[2001]).

A subsequent clockwise swing of s1 to the NNW-\nSSE is compatible with the following fault kinematics: (1)\nnormal (dextral?) displacement on the West and East Vartry\nfaults, and dextral transtension on the Codling and Bray\nfaults, (2) NW-SE dextral-normal brittle shear zones cutting\nthe NE margin of the Leinster Granite, and (3) sinistral\ntranspression on the fault strands that bound the Wicklow\nHigh block. The reasons for the subtle clockwise swing in\nstress orientations between the two deformation events is\nunclear, but Go\u00a8lke et al. [1996] showed that local structures\ncan cause significant modifications of the regional stress\nfield.\n[47] The youngest stress system is compatible with the\nsyn- and post-Oligocene stress system inferred from the\nLough Neagh-Ballymoney basins of NE Ireland [Geoffroy\net al., 1996; Kerr, 1987; Mitchell, 1980; Parnell et al.,\n1988; Solla-Hach, 2002] and the Cenozoic stress system\ninferred from western Ireland [Dewey, 2000] (Figure 9). It is\nalso in harmony with Eocene to mid-Oligocene displace-\nment on the dextral-reverse, NW-SE trending Sticklepath-\nLustleigh fault and pull-apart basins of SW England\n(Figure 9) [Bristow and Hughes, 1971; Blundell, 2002],\nsinistral displacement of Cenozoic dike swarms along the\nNE-SW trending Menai Strait fault system of north Wales\n[Bevins et al., 1996], early Neogene shortening in the\nCockburn Basin [Smith, 1995], and SE directed compres-\nsion from early Eocene time onward across much of the NW\nEuropean margin [Dore\u00b4 et al., 1999] (Figure 9).\n6.4. Mechanisms\n[48] Regional apatite fission track studies consistently\nshow evidence for Cenozoic cooling events on the NW\nEuropean margin. A major one occurred at \u000230 Ma with\n1 to 3 km of denudation [Lewis et al., 1992; Rohrman et al.,\n1995; Green et al., 1993, 2000; Allen et al., 2002]. Com-\npaction studies and burial estimates suggest similar magni-\ntudes of denudation [e.g., Bulat and Stoker, 1987; Murdoch\net al., 1995; Japsen, 1997]. Japsen and Chalmers [2000]\nsummarized evidence for, and attempted to link, Cenozoic\ntectonic activity and denudation around the North Atlantic.\nA number of studies have argued for either rock uplift or\ndenudation, or both, along various parts of the margin. For\nexample, Va\u02dagnes and Amundsen [1993] documented 1.7 km\nof denudation resulting from surface uplift of Spitzbergen\nsince 10 Ma, and van der Beek [1995] argued for \u00021.5 km\nof tectonic uplift in southern Norway since 30 Ma.\n[49] Two major tectonic events affected the European\nplate margins during the Cenozoic: the Alpine orogeny, and\nridge-push forces in the NE Atlantic. Dore\u00b4 et al. [1999]\nshowed that for the Cenozoic there was a reasonable\ncorrespondence between phases of Alpine shortening on\none margin of the plate with a slowing of spreading and\nhence increased shortening along the opposite, passive\nmargin.\n[50] Ziegler [1988] suggests that inversion in NW Europe\nwas due to Alpine compression, culminating in a late Alpine\ndocking event (Tethyan closure) of Miocene age. Blundell\n[2002] correlated Cenozoic inversion events in southern\nBritain with far-field Alpine tectonics. He showed that\nAlpine stresses were only transmitted into the foreland\nwhen they could not be accommodated within the orogen\nor flexural foreland basin. Ford and Lickorish [2004]\nprovided evidence for continued flexural subsidence from\nOligocene to late Miocene in the North Alpine Foreland\nbasin. Subsequent alpine deformation and uplift is seen in\nthe Paris Basin, the Rhine Graben, the Lulworth folds of\nsouthern Britain and Late Tertiary inversion in the North\nSea. This event may also have played a major role in\ninversion and exhumation of the Irish Sea region.\n[51] A number of authors have correlated Oligocene-\nMiocene inversions of Norwegian basins with plate reorga-\nnization in the adjacent ocean [e.g., Brekke and Riis, 1987;\nDore\u00b4 and Lundin, 1996]. Cloetingh et al. [1990] argued for\ndeformation and uplift in NW Europe because of Pliocene\nplate reorganization and changes in intraplate stress; how-\never, much of the denudation and associated sedimentation\nalong the NW European margin began in pre-Pliocene time.\nIn general, observed occurrences of Cenozoic crustal short-\nening in NW Europe is on the scale of 1\u20132%, e.g., western\nIreland [Dewey, 2000], basin inversions offshore Norway\n[Dore\u00b4 et al., 1999], and compression along the Faroe-\nRockall Plateau [Boldreel and Andersen, 1998]. These\nmagnitudes of shortening cannot account for the total\namount of Cenozoic exhumation inferred from vitrinite\nreflectance profiles and apatite fission track analysis [Brodie\nand White, 1995]. Therefore a number of authors have\nrelated Cenozoic denudation to regional uplift [e.g., Lovell\nand White, 1997; Jones et al., 2002].\n[52] Va\u02dagnes and Amundsen [1993] called on secondary\nmantle convection and underplating as an uplift mechanism.\nRohrman and van der Beek [1996] invoked asthenospheric\ndiapirism resulting from a Rayleigh-Taylor instability,\narguing that the initiation of Cenozoic tectonic and mag-\nmatic activity coincided with the imposition of hot Iceland\nplume asthenosphere beneath the margin of the European\ncontinental lithosphere at \u000230 Ma. Rohrman and van der\nBeek [1996] indicated that northern Britain and Ireland\nshould be underlain by an asthenospheric diapir, potentially\ncausing both transient and permanent tectonic rock uplift.\n[53] The importance of the ridge-push mechanism is\nreinforced by post-Oligocene development of broad wave-\nlength, low amplitude folds in the Traill \u00d8 region of East\nGreenland [Price et al., 1997], and by early Eocene to\nMiocene folding of Paleocene lavas on the Faroe-Rockall\nPlateau, adjacent to the Aegir Ridge [Boldreel and\nAndersen, 1998] (Figure 9). However, compression on the\nflank of the Icelandic mantle plume also needs to be\nconsidered as a possible mechanism for the development\nof these structures.\n[54] Dewey [2000] noted that the predominantly NW-SE\ntrends of Paleocene dikes in Scotland, northern Ireland, and\nthe Irish Sea swing to E-W and NE-SW trends in western\nIreland, suggesting that western Ireland is more distant from\nthe flanks of the Iceland plume head. Dewey [2000] also\nnoted that NW Europe was caught in the jaws of a\ncompressional vice from 22 to 9 Ma, created both by rapid\nconvergence between Africa and Europe and by North\nTC6002 CUNNINGHAM ET AL.: CENOZOIC ACTIVITY, SE IRELAND\n14 of 17\nTC6002\nAtlantic ridge-push forces. He concluded that Cenozoic\nuplift and deformation in western Ireland was driven by\nrift-shoulder uplift in the northeastern Atlantic and subse-\nquent ridge-push effects.\n[55] In summary, Cenozoic tectonic deformation and rock\nuplift on the NW European margin is most probably due to\nintraplate stresses driven from interaction between ridge-\npush and far-field Alpine compression [e.g., Roberts, 1989;\nDore\u00b4 and Lundin, 1996]. This link is strengthened by\nmodeling of the European stress field showing that the\npresent-day field, mainly NW-SE maximum horizontal\ncompression [Zoback, 1992; Mu\u00a8ller et al., 1992, 1997], is\ncaused by a combination of ridge-push and collisional\nforeland stresses [Go\u00a8lke and Coblentz, 1996]. Enhanced\ndenudation due to Pliocene-Pleistocene glaciations and\nisostatic rebound during interglacial periods was also an\nimportant factor in shaping the margin, but was probably of\nmore local, rather than regional, significance [Dore\u00b4 et al.,\n1999; Solheim et al., 1996].\n[56] In SE Ireland, exhumation began post-early Eocene\n[Cunningham et al., 2003] as part of a regional cooling\nevent that affected the Irish landmass at this time [Allen et\nal., 2002]. Cunningham et al. [2003] showed that the major\nrivers of SE Ireland are out of equilibrium with the present\ntopography in a manner that is consistent with the locations,\nmagnitudes, and vertical displacements on faults, that were\nprobably reactivated syn- or post-early Eocene. Episodes of\nshortening during the Oligocene in NE Ireland and the Irish\nSea, and during post-Oligocene time in SE Ireland, show\nthat local inversions were partially responsible for rock\nuplift and denudation during the Cenozoic. This pattern is\nconsistent within the regional tectonic framework of the\nNW European margin (Figure 9). However, NE Atlantic\nridge-push forces appear to be most dominant geodynamic\nmechanisms driving post-Oligocene inversion in rock uplift\nin SE Ireland.\n[57] Acknowledgments.
