This confirms the recent prediction by Fishman, Guarneri, and Rebuzzini [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n89, 084101 (2002)]. We also show how these accelerator modes can be identified with the stable regions of\nphase space in a classical-like chaotic system, despite their intrinsically quantum origin.\nPACS numbers: 05.45.Mt, 03.65.Sq, 32.80.Lg, 42.50.Vk\nThe search for signatures of chaos and stability in quantum\nsystems whose classical analogs can exhibit chaotic dynamics\nis an area of intense current theoretical and experimental inter-\nest. The motivation for such investigations is twofold. Firstly,\nthe study of the way in which complex classical behaviour has\nits origin in the quantum regime helps in understanding the\noperation of the quantum-classical correspondence principle\nand thus the physical processes that are crucial in determining\nobserved macroscopic behaviour, particularly when this be-\nhaviour is unpredictable and chaotic. Secondly, the quantum\ndynamics of such systems are of considerable interest in their\nown right, especially when the systems behave in a peculiarly\nnon-classical manner.\nThe study of quantum chaos and stability has focused on\nboth energetic and dynamical properties of systems [1, 2, 3,\n4]. Approaches to the classification of quantum systems\u2019 be-\nhaviour have ranged from the highly mathematical (e.g. trace\nformulae [2]) through the statistical (energy spectra [3]) to the\nmore phenomenological (energy and momentum transfer to\nensembles of particles [4]). It is the latter approach which\nis most appealing as a philosophy to guide experimental in-\nvestigations, and has underpinned the work presented in this\nLetter. Resonant, stable behaviour in quantum systems often\ndepends on precise fulfilment of matching conditions between\nperiodic forcing of a system and its own natural frequency.\nThis is in stark contrast to the looser matching which is gener-\nally required in the corresponding classically chaotic system\n[5]. The quantum resonances [6] observed in the \u03b4-kicked ro-\ntor [7, 8] represent an excellent example of this dichotomy\nbetween the quantum and the classical. These resonances are\ncharacterised by the steady transfer of momentum to the sys-\ntem, which in the atom-optical case [9, 10] manifests itself as\na symmetric broadening of the atomic momentum distribution\nfor special values of the driving frequency of the potential.\nThis phenomenon is therefore interesting in terms of both the\nmotivations outlined above.\nIn this Letter, we report the results of experiments using\nan atom-optical realization [11] of the \u03b4-kicked accelerator\n[12, 13, 14, 15]. This is realized when pulses from a vertical\nstanding wave of laser light are applied to freely falling laser-\ncooled atoms. The Hamiltonian for this system is given by\nH\u02c6 =\np\u02c62\n2m\n+mgz\u02c6 \u2212 ~\u03c6d[1 + cos(Gz\u02c6)]\n\u2211\nn\n\u03b4(t\u2212 nT ), (1)\nwhich is related to the classically chaotic \u03b4-kicked rotor by the\naddition of a static linear potential. Here z\u02c6 is the position, p\u02c6\nthe momentum, m the particle mass, g the gravitational accel-\neration, t the time, T the pulse period, G = 2\u03c0\/\u03bbspat, where\n\u03bbspat is the spatial period of the potential applied to the atoms,\nand ~\u03c6d quantifies the depth of this potential. The classical\ndynamics of this system are qualitatively similar to those of\nthe \u03b4-kicked rotor, whereas the quantum dynamics are quite\ndistinct. For example, the quantum accelerator modes recently\ndiscovered in this system [12] are not observed in the corre-\nsponding classical system. The modes are characterised by\nthe asymmetric transfer of a fixed momentum impulse per\nkick to approximately 20% of the initial ensemble of laser-\ncooled atoms. In a recent analysis of this phenomenon by\nFishman, Guarneri, and Rebuzzini (FGR) [5], quantum ac-\ncelerator modes were interpreted as being a resonant type of\nbehavior, closely related to the quantum resonances in the \u03b4-\nkicked rotor. This analysis also led to the fascinating predic-\ntion of the existence of whole families of higher-order quan-\ntum accelerator modes. These were shown to correspond to\nhigher-order fixed points centered on systems of islands in a\n(pseudo)classical phase space. In this Letter we report the\nfirst experimental observation of these higher-order accelera-\ntor modes, finding excellent quantitative agreement with the\nanalysis of Ref. [5].\nThe kicking potential acts on the atoms as a phase grating\nthat induces a phase modulation of amplitude \u03c6d to their de\nBroglie waves. Hence the effect of a pulse on a plane wave\nis to cause diffraction into a series of momentum states sepa-\nrated by the grating recoil ~G. Between consecutive pulses\nthese states accumulate a phase related to their kinetic en-\nergy. This phase evolution is determined by the value of T ,\nwhich will therefore govern the type of dynamics exhibited\nby the system. As in Refs. [14, 15], we use scaled position\nand momentum variables \u03c7 = Gz and \u03c1 = GTp\/m. An ef-\nfective scaled, dimensionless Planck constant k = ~G2T\/m\nis then defined through the relation k = \u2212i[\u03c7\u02c6, \u03c1\u02c6]. This pa-\nrameter, together with \u03c6d and \u03b3 = gGT 2 (which accounts\n2for the effect of gravity) fully describe the quantum dynamics\nof the \u03b4-kicked accelerator. When quantum resonances occur\nin the \u03b4-kicked rotor (\u03b3 = 0), the phase difference accumu-\nlated between momentum states separated by ~G from one\npulse to the next is equal to an integer multiple of 2\u03c0. For a\nstate of zero initial momentum, this is the case for values of\nT corresponding to k = 4\u03c0\u2113 where \u2113 \u2208 Z. This rephasing is\nanalogous to the Talbot effect in optics [16], and so we speak\nof these resonances as occurring at integer multiples of the\nTalbot time TT = 4\u03c0m\/~G2 [13]. For a continuous initial\ndistribution of momenta, such as in a cold atomic ensemble,\nresonant behavior is observed for k = 2\u03c0\u2113, i.e. at integer mul-\ntiples of the half-Talbot time, T1\/2 [9, 10, 14]. Close to these\nvalues of T , quantum accelerator modes are found in the \u03b4-\nkicked accelerator [14].\nIn our experimental realization of the quantum \u03b4-kicked ac-\ncelerator, about 107 caesium atoms are trapped and cooled in a\nmagneto-optic trap (MOT) to a temperature of 5\u00b5K, yielding\na Gaussian momentum distribution with FWHM 6~G. The\natoms are then released from optical molasses and, falling\nfreely under gravity, are exposed to pulses from a vertical\nstanding wave of off-resonant laser light that is 20GHz red-\ndetuned from the 62S1\/2 \u2192 62P1\/2, (F = 4 \u2192 F \u2032 = 3) D1\ntransition. Hence \u03bbspat = 447 nm and T1\/2 = 66.7\u00b5s. The\nintensity of the light in each pulse is approximately 1 \u00d7 108\nW\/cm2, and the duration of each pulse is 500 ns. Through the\naction of the ac Stark shift, these pulses result in \u03b4-function-\nlike applications of a spatially periodic potential to the atoms,\nwith \u03c6d = \u21262tp\/8\u03b4L. Here \u2126 is the Rabi frequency, tp the\nduration of each (square) pulse and \u03b4L the detuning from the\nD1 transition. Both the trapped atom density distribution and\nthe standing light wave intensity profile are Gaussian, with\nfull width at half maximum (FWHM) of 1mm. The result-\ning mean value of \u03c6d is around 0.8\u03c0. After application of the\ndiffracting pulses, the atoms fall through a sheet of light res-\nonant with the 62S1\/2 \u2192 62P3\/2, (F = 4 \u2192 F \u2032\u2032 = 5) D2\ntransition, located 0.5m below the point of release, and their\nmomentum distribution is measured by a time-of-flight tech-\nnique with a resolution of \u223c ~G. For more details regarding\nour experimental setup see Refs. [13, 14, 15].\nThe approach used by FGR [5] accounts for the observed\nacceleration of atoms participating in a quantum accelerator\nmode in terms of stable fixed points in a map for a classical\npoint particle. The validity of this map can be justified asymp-\ntotically by the closeness of k to integer multiples of 2\u03c0. The\npseudoclassical limit can be described by \u01eb = (k \u2212 2\u03c0\u2113)\u2192 0\n(hence the description \u2018pseudoclassical\u2019), or equivalently by\n(\u2113 \u2212 T\/T1\/2) \u2192 0. In an appropriately transformed frame\n[5], the map is given by [15]\n\u03c1\u02dcn+1 = \u03c1\u02dcn \u2212 k\u02dc sin(\u03c7n)\u2212 sign(\u01eb)\u03b3, (2)\n\u03c7n+1 = \u03c7n + sign(\u01eb)\u03c1\u02dcn+1, (3)\nwhere \u03c1\u02dc = \u03c1\u01eb\/k, and k\u02dc = \u03c6d|\u01eb|. With the correct initial con-\nditions, iteration of Eqs. (2) and (3) yields systems of acceler-\nator orbits. These are stable fixed points centered on islands in\nthe pseudoclassical phase space. To yield an observable quan-\ntum accelerator mode an island system must be sufficiently\nlarge, in terms of total phase-space area. Thus, in a classical\nsense, the islands must encompass sufficient phase space den-\nsity for the accelerator mode to be measurable. Furthermore,\nthe islands must be large, or at least comparable to |\u01eb| (which\ntakes the place of ~ as a measure of the size of a minimal\n\u2018quantum phase space\u2019 cell) for a point particle-like descrip-\ntion of the quantum accelerator mode dynamics to be appro-\npriate. We show in this Letter that when these requirements\nare satisfied, the momentum gain predicted by the analysis of\nFGR agrees very well with experiment, even when k is not\nextremely close to a resonant value. This can be understood\nas being due to the relevant dynamics taking place in stable\nregions of the pseudoclassical phase space, where semiclas-\nsical analyses can generally be expected to work reasonably\nwell [17].\nFGR [5] classify accelerator orbits (and thus quantum ac-\ncelerator modes) by the order p of the fixed point (i.e. how\nmany pulse periods it takes before cycling back to the initial\npoint in the reduced phase space cell) and the jumping index j\n(related to how many units of the momentum period of phase\nspace are imparted to the accelerating atoms per cycle). Par-\nticles in a pseudoclassical (p, j) mode with an initial momen-\ntum of q0~G have, after N kicks, a momentum (in units of\n~G) given by\nq \u2243 q0 +\nN\n|\u2113\u2212 T\/T1\/2|\n[\nj\np\n+ sign(\u2113\u2212 T\/T1\/2)\n\u03b3\n2\u03c0\n]\n, (4)\nin a frame accelerating with gravity. Only atoms of certain\ninitial momenta will be accelerated [13]; ideal values of q0\nand initial position can be determined analytically [5]. As our\nmolasses-cooled atomic ensemble extends over many phase\nspace cells, all such conditions can be satisfied. All atoms\nfulfilling these conditions will receive the same momentum\ntransfer. Since the mean initial momentum is 0, the central\nmomentum of the observed accelerator mode is well described\nby Eq. (4) with q0 = 0.\nTo search for high-order accelerator modes, we measured\nthe momentum distribution after a fixed number of pulses for\na range of T in the vicinity of the first three integer multi-\nples of T1\/2. Figure 1 displays the experimental momentum\ndistributions after 30 pulses for values of T in the region of\n(a) T1\/2 (T = 60.5\u00b5s to 74.5\u00b5s), (b) TT = 2T1\/2 (124.5\u00b5s\nto 142.5\u00b5s), and (c) 3T1\/2 (191.5\u00b5s to 209.5\u00b5s). The dotted\ncurves indicate the theoretical predictions of Eq. (4). There is\nsome disagreement for very large momenta, particularly large\nnegative momenta. At these momenta, the atoms have left the\nRaman-Nath regime [14], and move so quickly that they travel\na significant fraction of the standing wave period \u03bbspat during a\npulse. These atoms experience a spatially averaged potential,\nso it is no longer appropriate to speak of \u03b4-function-like kicks.\nSuch an effect will be stronger for atoms accelerated in the\nnegative direction (with gravity) than in the positive (against\ngravity).\n3FIG. 1: Pseudocolor plots of the variation with T of the experimental\nmomentum distribution after 30 kicks, in a frame falling freely with\ngravity. The value of T was varied around (a) T1\/2, (b) TT = 2T1\/2,\nand (c) 3T1\/2, in steps of 0.128\u00b5s. The overlaid dotted lines indi-\ncate the predicted momenta [Eq. (4)] of selected quantum accelerator\nmodes, labelled by (p, j).\nCertain of the more slowly accelerating (higher-order)\nquantum accelerator modes can only be resolved after apply-\ning a larger number of pulses than used in Fig. 1. To ob-\nserve the emergence of several such modes, the value of T\nwas scanned, for larger pulse numbers, in the region of TT.\nFigure 2 shows the experimental momentum distributions af-\nter (a) 60, (b) 90, (c) 120, and (d) 150 pulses. Overlaid white\nlines indicate the predictions of Eq. (4). In Fig. 2(a) we can\nnow identify the (13,-5) and (23,9) modes. After 90 kicks\n[Fig. 2(b)] the (18,-7) accelerator mode is emerging, whereas\nthe momenta of the (2,1) and the (5,-2) modes have grown be-\nyond the measurable range. In Figs. 2(c) and 2(d) the atoms\nhave received yet more momentum, and the (3,-1) mode is no\nlonger visible. Note also that some of the quantum accelera-\ntor modes seem to \u2018fade\u2019 and become diffuse with time; this\neffect is not predicted by the pseudoclassical model and may\nbe due to tunneling [5].\nWe now explicitly connect the experimentally observed\nhigher-order quantum accelerator modes around TT, as dis-\nplayed in Figs. 1(b) and 2, with their corresponding island sys-\ntems in pseudoclassical phase space. Figure 3 shows strobo-\nFIG. 2: Experimental momentum distributions for different pulse\nnumbers as T is varied in the vicinity of the Talbot time T = TT,\nfrom 124.5\u00b5s to 142.5\u00b5s in steps of 0.128\u00b5s. The total pulse num-\nber is (a) 60, (b) 90, (c) 120, and (d) 150. The overlaid dotted lines\nindicate the predicted momenta [Eq. (4)] of selected quantum accel-\nerator modes, labelled by (p, j).\nscopic phase space plots, generated numerically by repeated\niterations of Eqs. (2) and (3), for different values of T around\nTT. The island systems can be identified with the experimen-\ntally observed quantum accelerator modes. Comparing Figs.\n2 and 3, we see that the appearance and disappearance of the\nquantum accelerator modes and of the stable island systems\nas T is varied coincide. Figure 3(a) (T = 130.0\u00b5s) shows the\nthree large islands corresponding to the (3,-1) quantum accel-\nerator mode.

(2) and (3) for values of T close to the Talbot time TT.\nThe islands correspond to the following quantum accelerator modes:\n(a) T = 130.0\u00b5s, and (p, j) = (3,\u22121); (b) T = 132.2\u00b5s,\n(p, j) = (5,\u22122) (shorter, rounder islands) and (8,-3) (thin, elon-\ngated islands); (c) T = 132.8\u00b5s, (p, j) = (13,\u22125); (d) T =\n133.5\u00b5s, (p, j) = (23, 9); (e) T = 134.2\u00b5s, (p, j) = (5, 2); and\n(f) T = 139.4\u00b5s, (p, j) = (2, 1). We have clustered the initial con-\nditions around the fixed points corresponding to accelerator orbits to\nhighlight the structure of the island system of interest.\ntence of a (5,-2) and a (8,-3) island system at T = 132.2\u00b5s,\nwhich can be seen to be consistent with the experimental re-\nsults in Figs. 1(b) and 2(a). Interestingly, these yield simul-\ntaneous momentum transfer in opposite directions, promis-\ning application as a beam-splitting technique. Figure 3(c)\n(T = 132.8\u00b5s) shows the emergence of a (13,-5) accelera-\ntor orbit, while in Fig. 3(d) we see a complex (23,9) island\nsystem at T = 133.5\u00b5s (just greater than TT). This neverthe-\nless appears to correspond to a fairly robust quantum accel-\nerator mode that is clearly visible in each of the subplots of\nFig. 2. Moving further away from TT, in Figs. 3(e) and 3(f)\n(T = 134.2\u00b5s and 139.4\u00b5s, respectively), we again observe\ncomparatively simple orbits, (5,2) and (2,1), respectively.\nIn conclusion, we have successfully observed a multitude of\nquantum accelerator modes of up to 23rd order, and connected\nthem to the periodic orbits of a classical map. This was de-\nrived by FGR [5] as a pseudoclassical limit of the underlying\nquantum dynamics when the pulse period approaches certain\nresonance times. Linking this theory with our experiment, we\nhave successfully performed quantum accelerator mode spec-\ntroscopy. Confirmation of the validity of such a theoretical\napproach promises new avenues for investigation of quantum-\nclassical correspondence in a chaotic context. Furthermore,\nthe efficient momentum transfer occurring in these atomic dy-\nnamics is of great intrinsic interest. We have recently demon-\nstrated quantum accelerator modes to be formed coherently\n[15], and the simultaneous existence of quantum accelerator\nmodes in opposite momentum directions could be applied as\na beam-splitter for large-area atom interferometry [18].\nWe thank R.
