INTRODUCTION\nTwo of the oldest problems in molecular spectroscopy\nare the shift in infrared absorption bands from the vapor to\nthe liquid when a molecule is solvated1 and the concomitant\nchange in interatomic bond lengths.2 These are usually blue-\nshifts of the vibrational frequency indicating bond compres-\nsion but sometimes redshifts indicating bond stretching. The-\noretical models have focused on the properties of the solute\nmolecule and how it is affected by solvent-solute interactions\nsince the early model of Onsager3 and Bauer and Magat4\nwho proposed that the dielectric constant of the solvent af-\nfects the solute. Following Buckingham et al.,5 Schweizer\nand Chandler6 developed a statistical mechanical theory in-\nvoking competition between short-range and long-range\nsolvent-solute interactions, with a hard-sphere model for the\nshort-range interactions. This theory has been developed fur-\nther by many authors.2,7 Good agreement with experiment\nhas often been found, but with sensitive dependence on fit-\nting parameters such as the hard-sphere radius of the solvent\nand the length scales of attractive solvent-solute\ninteractions.7 These theoretical approaches neglect solvent-\nsolvent interactions except indirectly as they determine, for\nexample, the density of the solvent.\nIn this paper, we adopt a complementary approach to\nunderstanding the way vibrational frequencies associated\nwith molecular bonds change when the molecules are sol-\nvated. Instead of decomposing the often complex solvent-\nsolute interactions into bond-lengthening and bond-\nshortening contributions, it is shown that experimental\na\u0002Electronic mail: d.faux@surrey.ac.uk\n0021-9606\/2006\/124\u000220\u0001\/204506\/7\/$23.00 124, 2045\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject toresults can also be interpreted in terms of a general solvation\npressure added to atom-specific masking interactions. It is\nshown that for certain vibrational frequencies, the solvation\npressure is sufficient to describe quantitatively the change in\nvibrational frequency associated with the bond shortening of\nmolecular bonds from the vapor to the liquid without re-\ncourse to masking interactions. However, atom-specific\nmasking interactions are required to explain the behavior of\ncertain bond types, such as those affected by hydrogen bond-\ning, where the vibrational properties of a bond are especially\nsensitive to the local environment or where a liquid mixture\nexhibits nonrandom structure. The nature of the masking in-\nteractions may be elucidated by molecular dynamics simula-\ntion although it is plausible, also, that the decomposition of\nthe system interactions into solvation pressure plus masking\ninteractions could also be achieved using the statistical me-\nchanical theory of Schweizer and Chandler,6 adapted to in-\nclude solvent-solvent effects.\nThe solvation pressure is a ubiquitous pressure experi-\nenced by all nanoparticles immersed in a solvent and is equal\nto the cohesive energy density \u0001CED\u0002 of the liquid. The CED\nis defined as the heat of vaporization per unit volume:\nCED =\n\u0001Uvap\nVL\n, \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0001Uvap is the internal energy change on vaporization\nand VL is the volume of the liquid. The CED is also the\nsquare of the Hildebrand solubility parameter, which is used\nin determining the energetics of mixing.8 The CED is well\nknown for a range of liquids, for example, 7 kbars for etha-\n9\nnol, 23 kbars for water, and 3.6 kbars for chloroform.\n\u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics06-1\n AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jcp.aip.org\/jcp\/copyright.jsp\n204506-2 Hubel et al. J. Chem. Phys. 124, 204506 \u00022006\u0001The change in bond length due to the solvation pressure\ndepends on the properties of the solvent only. All solutes\nexperience the same solvation pressure and so the solute\nmolecule simply acts as a pressure gauge. In the case of pure\nliquids, each molecule can be considered to be a solute mol-\necule in a solvent of its own type. Good evidence that sol-\nvents exert a pressure on solute molecules and nanoparticles\nexists for carbon nanotubes,10 cosolvent molecules, and\nstarch grains.11\nThe effect of solvation pressure is to shorten the mean\nlength of bonds and hence to increase the Raman frequencies\nassociated with certain bond vibrations. If the solvation pres-\nsure was the only influence on a bond then, taking chloro-\nform as an example, the shift in the vibrational frequencies in\ngoing from the vapor to the liquid should equal that due to\n3.6 kbars of pressure, where 3.6 kbars is the CED for chlo-\nroform. In other words, the bonds should shorten from chlo-\nroform vapor to liquid by an amount equivalent to 3.6 kbars\nof hydrostatic pressure applied externally to the liquid. This\ninterpretation will be referred to as the solvation pressure\nmodel, or SPM for brevity. The solvation pressure effect\nmust have profound effects in wet chemistry and biochemis-\ntry because although solvents of course have specific inter-\nactions with solutes, these will be superposed on general\neffects equivalent to large external positive and negative\npressures.12\nThe SPM has been tested previously using molecular\ndynamics \u0001MD\u0002 simulations and, experimentally, using Ra-\nman spectroscopy.11,12 MD simulations allow the bond\nlengths of molecules in the liquid or vapor state to be directly\ncompared. Raman spectroscopy allows the effect of a change\nin bond length to be observed through the change in peak\nposition of certain vibrational modes. Moreover, observation\nof these changes with the application of hydrostatic pressure\nallows the magnitude of the vapor-liquid changes to be cali-\nbrated with pressure, enabling the ansatz that the solvation\npressure is equal to the CED to be tested. For example, MD\nsimulations of ethanol demonstrated that the shortening of\nmost bond lengths in the liquid compared to the vapor was\nconsistent with 7 kbars of hydrostatic pressure, approxi-\nmately equal in magnitude to the CED.11\nQuantitative agreement between experiment and the\nSPM exists for many Raman frequencies and for other ef-\nfects such as starch gelation,11 but there are also discrepan-\ncies for many other data. Differences from the simple pre-\ndictions of the SPM can be attributed to specific solvent-\nsolute interactions.11 We refer to these as \u201cmasking\ninteractions\u201d and these interactions would, of course, be rep-\nlicated by a fully accurate MD simulation. In ethanol, for\nexample, those bonds affected by the hydrogen-bonding in-\nteractions associated with the OH group revealed the greatest\ndiscrepancy from the simple SPM and hence the most sig-\nnificant masking interactions.\nIn this paper, we present experimental and theoretical\ndata for chloroform and test the solvation pressure plus\nmasking interaction approach to the analysis of the change in\nvibrational frequencies of a solute. We report a MD study of\nchloroform vapor, liquid, and liquid under pressure and we\ncompare the results with experimental data on the vapor, on\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject tothe liquid at ambient pressure, and on the liquid under high\npressure in a diamond-anvil cell. MD simulations reproduce\nthe density, bulk modulus, and compressibility of chloro-\nform, demonstrating that the interatomic potentials are of\ngood quality, yet the MD simulations do not reproduce the\nbehavior of certain vibrational modes, suggesting that the\ngeneric intramolecular potentials are not sufficiently opti-\nmized for chloroform, especially with respect to the H atom.\nWe argue that the simplifications inherent to the MD model,\nin particular, the use of pressure-independent potentials, have\nremoved some masking interactions, leaving the ubiquitous\neffects of solvation pressure clearly revealed. The change in\nbond lengths between vapor and liquid, however, clearly\ndemonstrates the solvation pressure effect.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Details of the MD\nsimulations are presented in the following section and the\nresults are analyzed in tandem with experimental results for\nchloroform in Sec. III where we show that the MD model of\nchloroform provides good agreement with the predictions of\nthe SPM and that the experimental results produce consistent\nagreement for some bonds, but not others, particularly with\nvibrations associated with the H atom. The conclusions are\npresented in Sec. IV.\nII. MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATION\nA. Simulation of liquid chloroform\nWe used the MD package DLPOLY2,13 as this program is\nwell supported and has been used successfully for a range of\nsimple atomic and molecular systems. For liquid chloroform,\nthe simulation volume is a cube with periodic boundary con-\nditions, initialized with 100 CCl3H molecules randomly ori-\nented at random positions with each molecule at a sufficient\ndistance from neighboring molecules to ensure that the inter-\nmolecular forces are not strong enough to cause molecular\nbreakup during the initial phase of the equilibration. At this\nstage, the density is about 25% less than the experimental\nvalue for CCl3H at STP.\nThe system energy was minimized by running at zero\nKelvin for 5\u0002105 time steps of 0.2 fs. Then the temperature\nwas raised in steps of 50 K using successive runs of\n2\u0002105 time steps as an NVT ensemble \u0001constant number of\nmolecules, volume, and temperature\u0002 using the Nos\u00e9-Hoover\nthermostat and equilibrated at 298 K over a final 1\u0002105\ntime steps. This produces a system of 100 chloroform mol-\necules equilibrated at room temperature but at a density 25%\nlower than the experimental value.\nThe volume was reduced by allowing the simulation cell\nto shrink during an NPT run \u0001constant number, pressure, and\ntemperature\u0002 of 2\u0002104 shorter time steps of 0.0002 fs. The\nshort time step ensures that the rate of contraction is slow\nenough to avoid the large intermolecular forces that can lead\nto the system becoming unstable. The target pressure speci-\nfied for the NPT ensemble was 30 kbars, but this pressure is\nnot reached due to the short duration of the NPT run. In-\nstead, a contraction of the cell by about 0.01 nm is achieved.\nThe ensemble was then equilibrated at 298 K as an NVT\n5ensemble over 1\u000210 time steps of 0.2 fs.\n AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jcp.aip.org\/jcp\/copyright.jsp\n204506-3 Solvation pressure in chloroform J. Chem. Phys. 124, 204506 \u00022006\u0001Data were sampled in an NVE \u0001constant number, vol-\nume, and energy\u0002 run of 1\u0002105 time steps with thermody-\nnamic data acquired at every time step, while atomic posi-\ntions and velocities were acquired every 25 time steps. The\nNVE ensemble is used for the data acquisition because the\nNos\u00e9-Hoover thermostat used for an NVT ensemble scales\nthe atomic velocities and the Berendsen barostat used for an\nNPT ensemble scales the cell volume, and consequently the\nbond lengths. Both the thermostat and the barostat thus in-\nterfere with a quantity that we wish to measure.\nRepetition of the NPT-NVT-NVE cycle enables data to\nbe obtained at different volumes \u0001and hence pressures\u0002. In\neach case, the mean temperature and mean pressure were\nmonitored during the NVE runs to assess the state of equi-\nlibrium in each case. The mean temperature was close to\n298 K and no pressure drift was observed, confirming that\neach system was properly equilibrated during the NVT run.\nB. Simulation of chloroform vapor\nMD simulations of chloroform vapor at NTP are under-\ntaken so that the bond lengths and positions of the Raman\npeaks can be compared to the liquid at NTP. The solvation\npressure experienced by each liquid molecule is reflected by\na shortening of the mean bond lengths compared to the vapor\nand can be observed directly. The change in bond length can\nthen be compared to such changes due to the application of\nhydrostatic pressure to the liquid in simulations described in\nthe previous section.\nThe vapor is modeled by placing a single chloroform\nmolecule in a simulation cell and employing the NVE en-\nsemble. The cell is sufficiently large that any interaction be-\ntween the molecule and its images due to periodic boundary\nconditions is negligible. A larger number of time steps are\nrequired for a run, typically 108, in order to extract data with\ngood statistics. The temperature fluctuated by about 100 K\nduring the simulations with the mean temperatures of each\nrun lying in the range of 250\u2013350 K.\nC.

Bulk properties of chloroform\nIt is important to compare physical quantities for bulk\nchloroform obtained from the MD model with experimental\nvalues to assess the quality of the Dreiding potentials for\nchloroform. Results are summarized in Table II.\nThe density of chloroform at NTP is 1390 kg m\u22123, in\nreasonable agreement with the experimental value of\n1480 kg m\u22123. The difference, about 6%, is typical of a MD\nsimulation of a liquid. The CED was calculated by using the\ndifference of the configurational energy between the liquid\nand the vapor state. The configurational energy is the poten-\ntial energy due to inter- and intramolecular forces. The CED\nis found to be 3.49 kbars which is in very good agreement\nwith the experimental value of 3.61 kbars.\nPrevious MD simulations of hydrocarbons16,17 have\nshown a strong correlation between the CED and the internal\npotentials used in the MD simulations.

For the calculation of the in-\nternal pressure \u0006i, only the configurational energy was used.\nThe kinetic energy is a function of T only and can therefore\nbe ignored. The configurational energy was plotted as a func-\ntion of volume for pressures less than 6.8 kbars and fitted\nwith a straight line. The slope, \u0006i, was found to be\n3.44 kbars, very close to the value of the CED. This comes\nas no surprise as the equivalence of CED and \u0006i is well\nknown for molecules of spherical symmetry which interact\nonly through dispersive forces.18,19\nThe bulk modulus was found at two pressures by fitting\nthe pressure and volume data to the Murnaghan equation of\nstate,\nP =\nB0\nB\u0001\n\u0006\u0006 V0V\u0001P\u0002\u0007B\u0001 \u2212 1\u0007 , \u00016\u0002\nwhere B is the bulk modulus, the subscript 0 refers to NTP,\nand B\u0001 is the pressure coefficient of the bulk modulus.9 Once\nagain, the agreement between simulation and experiment is\nvery satisfactory.\nThe radial distribution functions \u0001RDFs\u0002 of the liquid are\nobtained at NTP and the first peak position for the Cl\u2013Cl and\nCl\u2013H RDFs are presented in Table II. The simulation slightly\noverestimates the Cl\u2013H peak position. Overall, the agree-\nment is as good as can be expected using the generic Dre-\niding potentials.\nB. Bond lengths\nIn Fig. 1 the mean C\u2013Cl and C\u2013H bond lengths obtained\nfrom the MD simulations are plotted against the pressure for\nthe chloroform liquid. Consistent with the SPM, we have\nadopted the practice of plotting the results of the liquid simu-\nlation at NTP at 0 kbar. Thus the bond lengths in the vapor\nphase, which are also shown, are plotted at the negative pres-\nsure corresponding to the simulated CED. Strictly, in the\nSPM, the molecules are under zero total pressure in the gas\nTABLE II.

The C\u2013Cl bond length\nappears to respond to solvation pressure in the same manner\nas applied hydrostatic pressure, since the bond length in the\nvapor lies, within error, on the trend line of the high-pressure\ndata. The C\u2013H bond does not agree so well, but still lies near\nthe trend line. The uncertainty in the mean C\u2013H bond length\nis large in the vapor phase due to the larger vibrations asso-\nciated with its small mass of H.

Since it is only the\nshifts with pressure and solvation that matter, this is equiva-\nlent to plotting the frequency shifts \u0001\t.\nFigures 3\u20135 show the frequencies of the six strong peaks\nin the chloroform spectrum of Fig. 2 plotted as a function of\npressure, together with the corresponding peaks in the vibra-\ntional spectrum of the MD simulation. The frequencies in the\nvapor phase are also shown, plotted at the negative pressure\ncorresponding to the simulated CED. For the 261 cm\u22121 anti-\nsymmetric C\u2013Cl bending mode \u0003Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002\u0004, agreement be-\ntween MD and experiment is excellent.

Note that the MD vapor point falls very close to the\nfit, extrapolated to negative pressure. This peak was not ob-\nserved in the experiment in the vapor. This result is as pre-\ndicted by the SPM.\nFor the 368 cm\u22121 symmetric C\u2013Cl bending mode \u0003Fig.\n3\u0001b\u0002\u0004, the agreement between experiment and MD is reason-\nable. Agreement could be improved by using a more accurate\nvalue of K, the parameter defining the valence bond-angle\npotential. However, the important result is that both the ex-\nperimental and MD vapor points fall very close to their re-\nspective quadratic fits to the pressure data. That is, both ex-\nperiment and MD agree well with the predictions of the\nSPM.\nFigure 4 shows the Raman peak position of the 667 cm\u22121\nsymmetric and the 757 cm\u22121 antisymmetric C\u2013Cl modes for\nthe vapor and for the liquid as a function of pressure. Once\nagain, the MD vapor points lie very close to the quadratic fits\nto the MD pressure data as predicted by the SPM. The ex-\nperimental data show that the peak position increases with\npressure but to a much lesser extent than predicted by the\nMD simulations.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe generic Dreiding potential set provides a good ap-\nproximation to the interatomic potentials in chloroform with\nmost bulk properties giving satisfactory agreement with ex-\nperiment. Ab initio modeling may provide a route to im-\nproved interatomic potentials that could better replicate the\nambient-pressure vibrational frequencies. However, that is\nnot the objective of the work reported here.\nThere are several intriguing points raised by the present\nresults. First, the Dreiding potentials yield better agreement\nwith the model of solvation pressure than does the real chlo-\nroform. The difference in bond lengths between the MD\nsimulations of vapor and liquid at NTP clearly demonstrates\nthe solvation pressure effect in the liquid. Moreover, the\npressure dependence of the bond lengths and vibrational fre-\nquencies shows that the magnitude of the solvation pressure\nis equal to the CED, with the exception of C\u2013H bond data.\nHere, the small mass of the H means that the bond length and\nvibrational behavior are vulnerable to the local orientation of\nthe molecules in the liquid. We note that a similar observa-\ntion was made with ethanol.11\nIt follows that the SPM is general, but that specific in-\nteractions occur in the real system so as to mask the solva-\ntion pressure effects. The experimental results for the anti-\nsymmetric C\u2013Cl bending and symmetric C\u2013Cl bending mode\nas a function of pressure are also in good agreement with the\nSPM.\nHowever, because experiment agrees less well with the\nsolvation pressure model than does the MD simulation, the\nDreiding potentials must omit an interaction or a perturba-\ntion of importance to the pressure or density dependence of\nthe vibrational spectrum and, specifically, to those peaks in it\nin which the CH group is involved. It is not a large term that\nis omitted, for the softening that it causes amounts to no\nmore than 1%\u20133% over the density range from \n=0 in the\nvapor to \n=2 g cm\u22123 at the highest pressures. The obvious\ncandidate for the missing term is a perturbation of the hydro-\ngen two- and three-body intramolecular potentials in the\npresence of other molecules. Such a perturbation need only\nsoften the potentials for the modes in which the carbon and\nhydrogen move \u0001or, equivalently, increase the reduced mass\nFIG. 5.

Redistribution subject tothe CED of the liquid. Indeed, the experimental determina-\ntion of the pressure dependence of Raman modes together\nwith MD simulation may provide a tool to examine such\neffects. These effects may also be considered as solvent-\nsolute interactions, although the solute here is the same mo-\nlecular type as the solvent, and we would expect the statisti-\ncal mechanical descriptions discussed in Sec. I \u0001Refs. 2 and\n5\u20137\u0002 to account for these masking interactions. Indeed, the\ngeneral form of the Raman shift calculated by Mel\u00e9nd\u00e9z-\nPag\u00e1n and Ben-Amotz using the statistical mechanical de-\nscription is a linear dependence on density plus a linear de-\npendence on pressure.2 The differences between the MD\nresults and the experimental data in Figs. 4 and 5 can be\naccurately fitted to this general form.\nFinally, it is noted that the present approach to solvation\neffects could not usefully be extended to lower fluid densi-\nties. Indeed, it would be unphysical to attribute a cohesive\nenergy density and consequent solvation pressure to a fluid at\na reduced density where phase separation into liquid and gas\ntakes place. It would be interesting, however, to consider\nlow-density fluids at high temperatures where the reduced\ndensity is stable.\nIn conclusion, comparisons of experiment and MD con-\nfirm that it is masking effects, or solvent-solute interactions,\nthat vitiate purely experimental demonstrations of the valid-\nity of the solvation pressure model. The key result here is\nthat a simplification of the true potentials can eliminate or\nreduce masking effects, thereby exhibiting more clearly the\neffect of the solvation pressure. These MD simulations of\nchloroform expose the ubiquitous nature of solvation pres-\nsure.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Queen Mary, University\nof London and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Re-\nsearch Council \u0001EPSRC\u0002, UK for their support of this\nproject.\n1 E.
