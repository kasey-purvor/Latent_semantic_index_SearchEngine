Introduction to energy storage\nElectrical energy storage systems have been in use since\nat least 1870 when Victorian industrialist Lord Armstrong\nbuilt one of the worlds first hydroelectric power stations\nat Cragside in Northumberland, UK (Bowers, 1982). In\nhydroelectric schemes, the penstock valve regulates the\nconversion of potential energy held by water in an up-\nper reservoir into electrical energy by a turbine-generator\nset. The storage capacity of a scheme is determined by the\nvolume of water available in the reservoir and the power\noutput by the rating of the generator (S\u00f8rensen, 2004). In\nthe middle of the twentieth century power systems rapidly\nchanged from isolated networks with local generation and\nload, to a fully interconnected national system with trans-\nmission of bulk generated electricity to passive distribu-\ntion networks (Lehtonen and Nye, 2009). This suited the\nfavoured primary energy sources at that time, initially coal\nand oil, then later nuclear and gas.\nElectricity distribution networks have entered a period\nof considerable change, driven by several interconnected\nfactors; ageing network assets, installation of distributed\ngenerators, carbon reduction targets, regulatory incen-\ntives, and the availability of new technologies (Bouffard\nIPlease cite this article as: Wade, N.S., et al., Eval-\nuating the benefits of an electrical energy storage sys-\ntem in a future smart grid. Energy Policy (2010),\ndoi:10.1016\/j.enpol.2010.07.045\n\u2217Corresponding author. Tel.: +44 191 334 2507\nEmail address: n.s.wade@durham.ac.uk (N.S. Wade)\nand Kirschen, 2008)(Scott, 2004). In this climate, the use\nof distributed storage has re-emerged as an area of consid-\nerable interest. The end of this period of transition will\nbe signalled by the successful establishment of the tech-\nnology and practices that must go together to create what\nis termed the Smart Grid. The UK Electricity Networks\nStrategy Group (ENSG) provide a useful definition of the\nterm Smart Grid (ENSG, 2009):\nA Smart Grid as part of an electricity power sys-\ntem can intelligently integrate the actions of all\nusers connected to it generators, consumers and\nthose that do both \u2013 in order to efficiently de-\nliver sustainable, economic and secure electricity\nsupplies.\nThe precise end state of this transition is not yet known,\none possibility is outlined up to 2050 by the ENSG in \u2018A\nSmart Grid Routemap\u2019 (ENSG, 2010).\nThe need to investigate the role of electrical energy\nstorage has been identified at governmental level. The\nParliamentary Renewable and Sustainable Energy Group\n(PRASEG) inquiry into \u2018Renewables and the grid: ac-\ncess and management\u2019 cites storage as a \u2018possible solu-\ntion for addressing variable renewable energy generation\u2019\nand highlights the need for \u2018Long- term, further research\nand development\u2019 and \u2018clear political and regulatory sig-\nnals\u2019 (PRASEG, 2010). In the UK Low Carbon Transition\nPlan (Government, 2009) storage is included in the list of\nkey elements of a UK smart grid. To enable new solutions\nPreprint submitted to Energy Policy August 27, 2010\nPlease cite this article as: Wade, N.S., et al., Evaluating the benefits of an electrical energy storage\nsystem in a future smart grid. Energy Policy (2010), doi:10.1016\/j.enpol.2010.07.045\nand technologies to be developed the UK regulator the Of-\nfice of the Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) has made\nthe 500M Low Carbon Networks Fund available to \u2018help all\nDNOs [distribution network operators] understand what\nthey need to do to provide security of supply at value for\nmoney as Great Britain (GB) moves to a low carbon econ-\nomy\u2019 (Ofgem, 2010). Although separate LCNF projects\nwill be run by the 14 DNOs that operate in GB, the use\nof this funding mechanism brings with it a requirement to\ndisseminate the findings to all concerned parties.\nIt was identified as early as 1959 that to make best use\nof renewable energy resources with a meteorologically de-\npendent output, a storage element to the overall system\nwould increase the energy yield (Giacoletto, 1959). As\nwell as increasing yield, the ability to add dependability\nto renewable resources has been widely investigated (Mc-\nDowall, 2005)(Paatero and Lund, 2005)(S\u00f8rensen, 1976).\nWhen distributed generation is added to the extremities\nof the distribution network, a change to the voltage profile\nalong the conductor carrying the current (commonly called\na feeder in distribution networks) can limit the amount of\npower that can be transferred by the network. Solutions\nhave been implemented that modify the automatic volt-\nage control (AVC) settings at the primary substation to\nincrease the sophistication of voltage management across\nall the feeders on the network such as Fundamentals Su-\nperTAPP n+ and Senergy Econnects GenAVC (Fila et al.,\n2008). Energy storage has the potential to achieve a less\ninvasive intervention, largely acting on only a single feeder,\nas has been explored by several authors (Arulampalam\net al., 2006) (Barton and Infield, 2004) (Tande, 2000).\nAside from being of benefit to distribution systems with\ndistributed generation, energy storage can be applied more\ngenerally to assist with and improve network operation.\nThe injection of ideal combinations of real and reactive\npower for voltage support and loss reduction was assessed\nby Kashem and Ledwich (2007). Oudalov et al. (2007)\nconcluded that a lead-acid based storage system could\nat present provide a profitable solution for primary re-\nserve capacity for frequency control. A similar result was\nfound for isolated power systems (Mercier et al., 2009).\nThe value of electrical energy storage for the purposes of\nenergy arbitrage, frequency regulation and network rein-\nforcement deferral was calculated for the New York system\nby Walawalkar et al. (2007). The authors concluded that\nsodium-sulphur (NaS) and flywheel units had a high prob-\nability of a positive net-present value in the New York City\nregion for energy arbitrage and frequency regulation. The\nrole of energy storage has been evaluated by Black and Str-\nbac (2007) for a scenario where a 20% share of total UK\ndemand is met by many large wind parks. They conclude\nthat energy storage has a role in managing short-term fluc-\ntuations in aggregate wind output, but traditional stand-\ning reserve provides the most economical solution to longer\nvariations. These examples highlight some areas in which\nenergy storage is considered to have potential for commer-\ncial exploitation in different markets; the analysis in this\npaper is of the technical benefits that can be achieved on a\nGB distribution network, which can then feed into market\nassessments.\nThe ability of an Energy Storage System (ESS) to trans-\nfer real power is limited by the installed storage capacity.\nAn operating regime could follow a pre-defined cycle of\ncharging and discharging that is known to be within the\nbounds of the device. A more sophisticated approach is to\ndetermine the prevailing network conditions from strate-\ngic measurements, and provide an appropriate response\nfrom the ESS. In this approach the demands put on the\nstorage capacity cannot be known with certainty in ad-\nvance. The inherent risk of a shortfall in capacity requires\na collaborative and coordinated sharing of the control task\nbetween several actions, such as storage, generator curtail-\nment and load control. Coordination of several elements of\ncontrol on the distribution network has been investigated\nin projects such as by the distribution management system\ncoordinated controller proposed by Bignucolo et al. (2008).\nThere is plentiful literature on the technologies now\navailable and under development for electrical energy stor-\nage. Divya and stergaard (2009) provide a review of al-\nternative battery types and give examples of applications\nin which they are in use. Hall and Bain (2008) compare a\nbroader range of storage technologies, including flywheels\nand superconducting magnetic energy storage. Future ad-\nvances that are expected in energy storage systems are\nexamined by Baker (2008). Additional examinations of\nstorage technologies (Carrasco et al., 2006) (Ribeiro et al.,\n2001) contribute to a broad coverage of the topic.\n2. Summary of benefits from energy storage\nThe GB electricity supply chain is deregulated and has\nclear divisions between generator companies, the transmis-\nsion system operator (TSO), distribution network opera-\ntors (DNOs) and supply companies. Application of en-\nergy storage to distribution networks can benefit the cus-\ntomer, supply company, DNO, TSO and generation opera-\ntor (conventional and DG) in several ways. Opportunities\nfor stakeholders in the electricity value chain were anal-\nysed by Delille et al. (2009) in the context of the French\ndistribution system and island networks. A series of re-\nports from Sandia National Laboratories assesses the cost-\nbenefit of transmission and distribution upgrade deferral\n(Eyer, 2009), and power quality, arbitrage and genera-\ntion capacity credit (Schoenung and Eyer, 2008) in the\nUS. Fourteen separate benefits are evaluated in the San-\ndia Labs Energy Storage Benefits and Market Analysis\nHandbook (Eyer et al., 2004). Drawn from a survey of the\nabove literature, the areas where energy storage systems\ncan be applied can be summarised as:\n\u2022 Voltage control; support a heavily loaded feeder, pro-\nvide power factor correction, reduce the need to con-\nstrain DG, minimise on-load tap changer (OLTC) op-\nerations, mitigate flicker, sags and swells.\n2\nPlease cite this article as: Wade, N.S., et al., Evaluating the benefits of an electrical energy storage\nsystem in a future smart grid. Energy Policy (2010), doi:10.1016\/j.enpol.2010.07.045\n\u2022 Power flow management; redirect power flows, delay\nnetwork reinforcement, reduce reverse power flows,\nminimise losses.\n\u2022 Restoration; assist voltage control and power flow\nmanagement in a post fault reconfigured network.\n\u2022 Energy market; arbitrage, balancing market, reduce\nDG variability, increase DG yield from non-firm con-\nnections, replace spinning reserve.\n\u2022 Commercial\/regulatory; assist in compliance with en-\nergy security standard (ER P2\/6) (Association, 2006),\nreduce customer minutes lost (a GB regulatory incen-\ntive designed to improve quality of service) (Ofgem,\n2005), reduce generator curtailment.\n\u2022 Network management; assist islanded networks, sup-\nport black starts, switch ESS between alternative\nfeeders at a normally open point.\nIt is evident in the literature that developing a com-\npelling business case for installing an energy storage sys-\ntem at distribution level in the current electricity market\nwith present technology costs will be difficult if value is\naccrued from only a single benefit. The importance of\nunderstanding the interactions between several objectives\nand quantifying the benefit brought to each of them is\na critical activity in evaluating the potential of electrical\nenergy storage.\nThis paper reports on research that has addressed the\nneed for the development of techniques that will enable\nthe benefits brought from ESS operation to be assessed.\nIn the next section the energy storage field trial project\nto which this work relates is introduced. This is followed\nby a description of the methodology used to evaluate the\nuse of electrical energy storage on distribution networks.\nResults from several simulations then illustrate how the\nchoices made in configuring and operating an ESS impact\non the performance. The results are discussed and lessons\nare set out along with observations on the implications in\nthe wider application of energy storage.\n3. Field trial of energy storage\nA project trial conducted by EDF Energy Networks,\nABB and Durham University is evaluating the use of en-\nergy storage on distribution networks. This began as one\nstrand of the AuRA-NMS Strategic Partnership between\nthe Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Coun-\ncil (EPSRC), ScottishPower Energy Networks, ABB and\nEDF Energy Networks (Davidson et al., 2009, 2008). On-\ngoing work focussing on the deployment of the storage\nsystem was the first project to register in the UK regu-\nlators (Ofgem) Low Carbon Network Fund (LCNF) as a\nFirst Tier project (Networks, 2010). This funding mecha-\nnism stipulates public dissemination of project findings, so\nthere is potential for this work to influence DNO policies\non energy storage.\nIn the summer of 2010 an energy storage system (ESS)\ndesigned and built by ABB will be installed on an 11kV\ndistribution network in the East of England. The ESS con-\nsists of a lithium-ion battery array coupled to ABBs SVC\nLight (a static VAr compensator or STATCOM) and con-\ntrol system. The ESS has been placed at a normally open\npoint (NOP) to allow connection to either one of two sec-\ntions of network fed from different primary substations as\nshown in Fig. 1. Distribution networks are designed with\nmany NOPs between different areas of the network to give\ncontrol engineers the capability to reroute power flows un-\nder fault conditions or during routine maintenance. Some\nunderground cable but predominantly overhead line forms\nthe network with a maximum length of 5 km. The loads\nserved by the feeders are a mixture of farming, light in-\ndustrial, residential and holiday accommodation and it is\nuseful to note that the feeders exhibit demand profiles that\ncontrast with each other on a diurnal and seasonal basis.\nDemand on each feeder averages 1.15 and 1.30 MW and\npeaks of 2.3 and 4.3 MW have been recorded. A 2.25 MW\nwind farm with fixed speed induction generators is at-\ntached midway along one feeder.\nThe ESS has a storage capacity of 200 kWh and a power\nelectronic converter capable of sinking or sourcing power\nof 600 kW and 600 kVAr simultaneously. The minimum,\nmodal and maximum demand on the feeders is 0.6, 1.2\nand 4.3 MW respectively. In this test installation, the en-\nergy capacity of the device will only provide power of a\nsignificant proportion of the peak network power flows for\nshort periods. However, interventions of a smaller mag-\nnitude also have benefits and can be sustained for longer\ndurations. The choice of device size was a balance between\nensuring measureable interventions can be made and keep-\ning costs in proportion for what is an experimental system.\nGiven the time-limited nature of the resource, this study\nis in part designed to determine the best outcome that can\nbe achieved within the operating parameters of the device.\nIn the course of this research, a framework for evaluating\nthe use of electrical energy storage systems on distribution\nnetworks has been developed. Steady-state analysis of an\nelectrical network model loaded with values from histori-\ncal operational data sampled at 30-min intervals combined\nwith an ESS model and control algorithm, simulate distri-\nbution network operation over a period of one year. An\nevent is considered to have occurred when a specified mea-\nsurement on the network (typically, but not limited to,\nvoltage or power flow) crosses a defined threshold. Multi-\nple events on multiple networks have been tackled simul-\ntaneously by operating an ESS to modify real and reactive\npower flows to the benefit of the network. Summary data\nhas been compiled to quantify the benefits accrued from\noperating an ESS and identify best practice.\n3\nPlease cite this article as: Wade, N.S., et al., Evaluating the benefits of an electrical energy storage\nsystem in a future smart grid.

The position of a windfarm on\nFeeder 1A is indicated by the letter G.\n4. Simulation methodology\n4.1. Network modelling\nAt the centre of simulation software is a control algo-\nrithm that follows deterministic rules to manage opera-\ntion of the ESS. Information processed by the algorithm\ncomes from measurements of the network state and inter-\nnal registers which retain the prior actions of the ESS. The\nalgorithm ensures that the capabilities of the ESS for both\npower rating and energy capacity are never exceeded. De-\ncisions on when to switch the ESS between feeders and\nbattery management are reached by following rules in the\nalgorithm.\nHistorical data for the networks on which the installa-\ntion is taking place was provided by EDF Energy Networks\nat a 30-minute resolution covering a period of several years.\nData included power flows on each feeder and DG output,\nwhich when put together allows the customer demand to\nbe calculated and network power flows and voltages to\nbe reconstructed by load flow analysis. Although there\nis a risk when using real data of errors and atypical oc-\ncurrences, the selected dataset was chosen because it was\nrecent, almost entirely intact and typical in comparison\nwith complete multi-year dataset.\nIPSA+ power system analysis software provided the\nload flow capability (?). A model of the network was built\nwith detail of transformers and conductors from the 33kV\nconnection point to the level of distribution transformers\non the feeders to which the ESS can be connected. On the\nother feeders the demand was represented by a lumped\nload for each feeder. IPSA+ provides an interface to the\nPython programming language, which enables automated\ncontrol of the network model and load flow engine. This\nfunctionality was used to provide the control algorithm\nwith measurements of the network state.\nAutomatic voltage control (AVC) is used to stabilise a\nprimary substations busbar voltage by adjusting the trans-\nformer winding ratios in response to variations in the in-\ncoming voltage and the load supplied. Load is determined\nfrom transducers measuring the current on each of the\noutgoing feeders from the substation. The presence of dis-\ntributed generation on a feeder causes a reduction in cur-\nrent and this is interpreted as a reduction in load by the\nAVC. This behaviour was not considered in the design of\nsuch voltage control schemes and it has been found that\nit is better to exclude feeders with distributed generation\nattached from contributing to the determination of volt-\nage set-points (Collinson et al., 2003). This prevents the\nreduction in demand on a feeder due to local consumption\nof distributed generation from causing the remote ends\nof other feeders to fall below the statutory voltage limit.\nIn the field trial network, the feeder with energy storage\n(Feeder 1A in Fig. 1) and one other feeder from the same\nprimary substation are excluded from the AVC due to DG\n4\nPlease cite this article as: Wade, N.S., et al., Evaluating the benefits of an electrical energy storage\nsystem in a future smart grid. Energy Policy (2010), doi:10.1016\/j.enpol.2010.07.045\nschemes, leaving the combination of currents on the three\nremaining feeders to dictate the AVC target voltage. This\nbehaviour is incorporated into the set up of the network\nsimulation.\nThe ESS is modelled in the network as a combination\nof load and generator, both of which can operate with a\npower factor from zero to unity. In this way the ESS device\ncan sink and\/or source real and\/or reactive power in any\ncombination within the rating of the system. Although\nreactive power up to the rating of the power electronic\nconverter is always available, the duration of an action us-\ning real-power is a function of the power level and limited\nby the capacity of the battery. Any time the battery is\nnot in the preferred waiting state-of-charge, power will be\nexchanged with the network to adjust the battery condi-\ntion, unless this process would cause the network to move\ninto an undesirable state.\nThe components of control algorithm, historical network\ndata, network model, load flow engine and ESS model were\ncombined to conduct a simulation of the system every 30\nminutes for a period of one year. Data was recorded at\neach simulation interval to characterise the changes in volt-\nage and power flow in terms of maximum values, minimum\nvalues and distributions. By altering parameters within\nthe control algorithm in several simulations, comparisons\nwere made between alternative operating strategies.\n4.2. Choice of objectives\nIn \u2018A Smart Grid Vision\u2019 the ENSG conducted a cost-\nbenefit analysis to identify the value of several improve-\nments that can be brought about through investment in\na Smart Grid (ENSG, 2009). The highest two discounted\nvalue benefits were given to Voltage Optimisation and De-\nmand Response, followed by Asset Management, Losses,\nDistributed Generation, Outages and Capacity Planning.\nAt an early stage of researching the application of energy\nstorage at distribution level, it was identified that there\nwas a capability to measurably influence voltage and power\nflow. The importance attributed to voltage optimisation\nand demand response combined with the ability to influ-\nence them, led to the selection of voltage control (VC) and\npower flow management (PFM) events for detailed evalu-\nation in this study.\nEvents were chosen to test the ability of the ESS to\nbring about improvements to voltage levels and power\nflow. When installed this will be a live project on a real\nnetwork, so the choice of targets must be able to be applied\nin reality, show a measurable change in network behaviour\nand not cause adverse effects on normal operation of the\nnetwork.\nEvents are defined by type, threshold, location and ac-\ntion. The type of event describes what is being monitored\non the network, four event types are considered here; over-\nvoltage, under-voltage, over-power and reverse-power-flow.\nThresholds were decided through two considerations; the\nnumber of events generated during the simulation year and\nhow feasible it is to address those events with the given\npower and energy ratings of the ESS. The choice made for\neach event is detailed below. Location determines where\nthe measurement is taken. The final parameter instructs\nwhat action should be taken in response to the occurrence\nof an event beyond the threshold at the specified location;\nthis can use the four-quadrant capability of the power elec-\ntronic interface to give any combination of sinking and\/or\nsourcing of real and\/or reactive power.\n4.3. Voltage control\nVoltage improvements were tested by setting a target\nband narrower than that recorded during network simu-\nlation without the intervention of the ESS. Two events\nwere defined to set the upper and lower limits of the band;\nover-voltage and under-voltage. Since both events cannot\noccur at the same time, they can never be in competition\nfor resources from the ESS. The details of voltage targets\nset on both networks can be seen in Table 1, along with\nthe targets for the events described below.\n4.4. Power flow management\nNetwork A has a windfarm connected mid way along the\nfeeder. A useful proxy to indicate the match between the\nwindfarm output and load demand is the power flow at\nthe point the feeder leaves the primary substation. In sit-\nuations where the current is flowing back into the substa-\ntion, there is more generation output than can be absorbed\nby the local demand. There are several reasons why this\nmight be an unfavourable situation; with high penetra-\ntions of DG, aggregation of generator outputs could lead\nto reverse power flows through the transformers and on-\nload tap-changer (OLTC) equipment onto the 33kV net-\nwork, there are limits to the extent this is permissible in\nsome cases due to the design of the OLTC (Cipcigan and\nTaylor, 2007). Even if this technical limitation does not\nexist, high levels of DG connection at 33kV and above can\nlead to congested networks into which further injections of\npower with only modest magnitude will cause over-loads.\nEnergy transferred away from the local load will have to\nbe returned later in time; local storage would relieve the\ndistribution network when the peak demand occurs. Re-\nverse power flow can occur with considerable magnitude,\nso it is not practical or indeed necessary to eliminate all\nreverse flow. A threshold was determined that balanced\nthe number of events with the ability to respond and in\nthis case reverse power flows greater than 0.4 MW were se-\nlected which gave approximately 600 events to act on. In\nresponse to a reverse-power-flow event the ESS action is to\nsink real power, redirecting DG output power downstream\nfrom the primary substation.\nNetwork B has no DG connected so power flow is uni-\ndirectional to the load. Reduction of peak power flows\nwas selected as an event for this feeder. The location for\nmeasuring power flow was chosen to be the conductor op-\nerating closest to its thermal capacity. Action was taken\nwhen power flow exceeded the specified threshold. Ap-\nproximately 800 events are generated throughout the year.\n5\nPlease cite this article as: Wade, N.S., et al., Evaluating the benefits of an electrical energy storage\nsystem in a future smart grid.

Structure of simulations\nThe hierarchy of simulation configurations is shown in\nFig. 2; four simulations assessed the events in isolation, two\nsimulations were required to cover each network with mul-\ntiple events and one simulation tested all events on both\nnetworks. It was necessary to run simulations with only\none event and then multi-event simulations on a single-\nnetwork to provide a comparison between each approaches.\nOnce more than a single event is to be considered by the\ncontrol algorithm, an appreciation of the timing and sever-\nity of each event is required to ensure that decisions are\ntaken that make the best use of the finite resources of the\nESS. With the events chosen in this simulation, there were\ncontrary requirements for the waiting state-of-charge from\nthe real-power based actions associated with the reverse-\npower-flow and over-power events. Network A required the\nbattery to be discharged ready to sink real-power, while\nNetwork B needed charge available to be sourced during\nover-power conditions. Through analysis of the time-of-\nday of events, opportunities were identified for adjusting\nthe waiting state-of-charge to be ready to deal with the\ngreatest number of events overall. This approach used\nprevious experience as a primitive forecasting technique;\nfurther gains would be accrued from a more sophisticated\nforecasting technique, making use of meteorological and\ndemand prediction information.\n5. Results\nBefore any interventions are made by the ESS, it is nec-\nessary to establish the count of each event under consid-\neration. At each sampling point in the year, separated\nby 30-minute intervals, the network is either in- or out-\nof-limit with respect to the target event. To present the\nevent count in a more meaningful way than can be achieved\nfrom a single number, any out-of-limit events that oc-\ncurred at each of the 48 sampling points during the day\nwere summed across the year of simulations. This pro-\ncess reveals the diurnal distribution of out-of-limit events\nexperienced on the network. Although not giving detail\nof the specific day on which events occur, Figs. 3\u20135 give\na strong indication of how well the time-of-day of events\nunder consideration complement each other.

This is implemented by charging\nthe battery at 16:30 in readiness for over-power events on\nNetwork B and discharging from 23:00 to be available for\nreverse-power events on Network A.\n6\nPlease cite this article as: Wade, N.S., et al., Evaluating the benefits of an electrical energy storage\nsystem in a future smart grid.

The reactive\npower used to intervene in these circumstances is gener-\nated by the power electronic converter switching an inte-\ngral capacitor bank and is independent of the energy stored\nin the battery. There is therefore no requirement to alter\nthe state-of-charge in readiness for these events, but the\nresult does give confidence that there will be minimal ESS\nresource conflict between networks.\n5.1. Performance metrics\nTwo measures of the degree of success due to the ESS\nactions are presented. If action by the ESS causes the\nevent to move below the threshold set point, then the event\nis considered to be solved. For power events there is a\nquantity of energy associated with an event which will be\nreduced by ESS action even if the event is not solved. As\nan example, take a situation when reverse-power-flow is\nrunning at 0.73 MW. Action by the ESS may only reduce\nthis quantity to 0.53 MW, so does not cross the 0.4 MW\n0\n400\n800\n1200\n1600\n2000\nP\/Q = 0.2 MW\/MVAr P\/Q = 0.4 MW\/MVAr\nEv\nen\nts\n \nso\nlv\ned\n\u0010\u0011\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0010\u0011\n\u0012 \u0014\n\u0010\u0011\n\u0012\u0015 \u0013\u0016\u0014\nN\net\n \nA \nvo\nlta\nge\nN\net\nA \npo\nw\ner\nN\net\nB \nvo\nlta\nge\nN\net\n \nA\nev\nen\nts\nN\net\n \nB \nev\nen\nts\nAl\nle\nve\nn\nts\nAl\nl e\nve\nn\nts\n,\nTS\nB\nN\net\n \nB \npo\nw\ner\nN\net\n \nA \nvo\nlta\nge\nN\net\nA \npo\nw\ner\nN\net\nB \nvo\nlta\nge\nN\net\n \nA\nev\nen\nts\nN\net\n \nB \nev\nen\nts\nAl\nle\nve\nn\nts\nAl\nl e\nve\nn\nts\n,\nTS\nB\nN\net\n \nB \npo\nw\ner\nFigure 6: Variation in number of events solved depending on config-\nuration of simulation and converter rating.\nthreshold but a significant improvement has been made\nnonetheless. As part of a coordinated approach, further\nimprovements to the situation would be handled by other\ntechniques; in this case DG curtailment could be used.\nConversely, a very small reverse power flow of 0.43 can be\nsolved with only a small magnitude ESS action.\nThe measure of events solved in Fig. 6 shows results for\nall the network configurations described in Fig. 2, with\nmaximum allowed power ratings of 0.2 MW\/MVAr on the\nleft and 0.4 MW\/MVAr on the right. Black bars indicate\nconfigurations operating on Net A, white bars on Net B,\nwhile the black and white bars show configurations oper-\nating on both Net A and B simultaneously. This choice\nof ratings is not intended as an investigation into the op-\ntimum sizing of a storage system; but working within the\nlimits of the field trial system, these alternative ratings il-\nlustrate the change in outcome due to the maximum power\nrating of the power electronic converter in the ESS. The\nconverter rating could be set by the electrical design char-\nacteristics of the device, or be an artificial limit imposed\nto suit a preferred operating strategy.\nSeveral features can be observed for both power ratings:\n\u2022 The number of voltage events solved is considerably\ngreater than power events.\n\u2022 Moving from single event to single network configura-\ntion yields a total of events solved close to the sum of\nthose events solved as single events.\n7\nPlease cite this article as: Wade, N.S., et al., Evaluating the benefits of an electrical energy storage\nsystem in a future smart grid. Energy Policy (2010), doi:10.1016\/j.enpol.2010.07.045\n\u2022 When time-of-day state-of-charge balancing (TSB) is\nused, a significant improvement is seen over the con-\nfiguration of multi-network with fixed waiting state-\nof-charge.\nAn increase in the number of events solved is seen for\nall configurations when the maximum allowed power is in-\ncreased from 0.2 to 0.4 MW\/MVAr. This effect is most\npronounced in the multi-network configurations. Operat-\ning with TSB makes use of knowledge gained from analysis\nof historical data to stipulate a time-of-day when the state-\nof-charge is adjusted. Advantage is taken of the temporal\ndifferences between the defined events on the two networks,\nwhich are seen in Figs. 3\u20135. Such a technique will work\non networks with sufficient complimentarity, and in this\ncase when operating in multi-network configuration with\nTSB, the number of events solved is greater than the sum\nof multi-event operation on Network A and Network B.\nThis can be interpreted to mean that in this situation it is\nbetter to use one ESS in collaboration between networks\nthan to operate two ESSs independently with one on each\nnetwork.\nMagnitude improvements in reverse-power-flow events\non Network A and over-power events on Network B in\nFig. 7 give further insight into the subtleties of configura-\ntion changes and maximum allowed power. Single-network\nconfigurations at 0.2 MW\/MVAr produce similar reduc-\ntions in energy associated with each event. When the\npower is increased to 0.4 MW\/MVAr, although improve-\nments in event count were seen, the associated energy falls\nwhen moving to a multiple-event configuration. The gains\nfrom operating multi-network with TSB are more pro-\nnounced than when simply considering the number events\nsolved. The ability to shift energy between feeders goes\nsome way to address the limitation of finite battery ca-\npacity. Consider a situation where an event is occurring\ncontinuously for an extended period of time, if there is no\nability to switch to an alternative feeder, when the battery\ncapacity is reached the ESS can only wait until the net-\nwork state has returned within limits to attempt to return\nthe battery to the state-of-charge required to tackle the\nevent. If it is possible to switch the ESS over to another\narea of network, which is either in a normal state or would\nbenefit from the transfer of power required to adjust the\nbattery state-of-charge, then after this operation the ESS\ncan be switched back to the original network and again\nprovide the necessary support for the ongoing event. The\nunderlying reason for tackling an event may be either es-\nsential or preferable, the period of time when the ESS is\nunable to intervene due to the state-of-charge adjustment\ntaking place would be tackled by another control measure\nin the first instance or could be left untouched if resolving\nthe event is only preferable.\nImprovements in voltage performance are quantified by\nthe furthest deviation from the edges of the target band in\nTable 2.

Network B sees the best result when\nconfigured to tackle both voltage and power events, the\nimprovement on the single event case is due to a synergy\nbetween the under-voltage and over-power events whereby\nsolving over-power events tends to improve under-voltage\nevents concurrently. The relative ability of the transfer\nof real or reactive power to affect a change in voltage is\ndetermined by the properties of the conductors in the net-\nwork. Unlike transmission systems where the dominance\nof the reactance of conductors means that voltage mag-\nnitude is almost exclusively controlled by reactive power\nexchanges, distribution system conductors have a ratio of\nreactance and resistance typically much closer to unity. In\nthis situation real power flow influences voltage to a much\nhigher degree. Synergies such as this observed for volt-\nage have not been explicitly sought after, but it should\nbe noted that further improvements to control algorithms\nshould consider the gains that can be obtained in this and\nsimilar ways.\n8\nPlease cite this article as: Wade, N.S., et al., Evaluating the benefits of an electrical energy storage\nsystem in a future smart grid.

Conclusions\nA simulation environment has been developed at\nDurham University that enables multiple types of network\nevent to be monitored and acted on simultaneously. Net-\nwork conditions are recreated from historical data by load\nflow analysis and an assessment is made on the applicabil-\nity of an intervention from the ESS. This was a response to\nthe need to evaluate the use of an ESS to act on a combi-\nnation of objectives in a versatile manner. The simulations\nconducted within this simulation environment have shown\nthat operating an ESS embedded in the distribution net-\nwork has a positive impact on the tasks of voltage control\nand power flow management. The selection of events re-\nquiring an intervention and corresponding actions has been\nreached through analysis of the network behaviour before\nthe addition of an ESS. Events were defined to generate\na quantity of occurrences suitable to exercise the capabil-\nities of the ESS, yet without being unreasonably difficult\nto resolve.\nThe decision made to locate the field trial ESS at a\nnormally open point between two feeders has allowed mul-\ntiple events to be tackled on multiple networks. Benefits\ngreater than the sum of the parts have been accrued across\nthe control objectives defined in this study. A single de-\nvice operating to improve conditions on two networks has\nbeen shown to be more effective than two devices work-\ning in isolated networks. Care must be taken in extending\nthis result to other networks, as differences in the temporal\npattern of network use are a significant factor. To achieve\nan improvement over the case of a single isolated network,\nsimple forecasting has been incorporated into the control\nalgorithm. Greater gains are achieved in a multi-network\nconfiguration when operating with comparatively higher\npower flows.\nESS operation to improve the events of voltage devia-\ntion, reverse-power-flow and over-power has been shown.\nIt is straightforward to expand the simulation to include\nany event that can be represented in the network model.\nAn arbitrary collection of events will have a series of inter-\nconnected dependencies, conflicts and synergies. Requests\nthat the events place upon ESS resources must be evalu-\nated to understand how event complementarity can be best\ndealt with in the control algorithm design. Choices have\nto be made on how to ration the use of both the power and\nenergy ratings of the ESS. The simulation techniques that\nhave been developed can assist in the formulation of op-\nerating strategies to allocate transfers of real and reactive\npower.\nIt is impractical to install an ESS that is capable of pro-\nviding a solution to all events at all times; either the events\nwould have to be very modest or the ESS very large. The\nESS operates to make a contribution to improving net-\nwork performance in cooperation with other Smart Grid\ncontrol actions such as active generator curtailment or de-\nmand side management. The proportion of contribution\nmade by energy storage depends upon the event definitions\nand the varying behaviour of the network on both short\nand long timescales. A higher power rating and energy ca-\npacity ESS could solve a greater number of problems but\nthere is a balance of cost\/benefit to be achieved. The most\nsuccessful strategy presented for this network for a device\nwith a capacity of 0.2 MWh and power rating capable of\n0.4 MW and 0.4 MVAr solved 2023 out of the 2979 events\ndefined for this simulation exercise. Leaving the power\nrating the same while doubling the capacity to 0.4 MWh\nsolves a further 91 events, doubling again to 0.8 MWh\nsolves a further 56 events. These diminishing returns sug-\ngest that for the events considered here it may be difficult\nto construct a compelling business case for the installa-\ntion of a device with sufficient capacity to respond under\nall contingencies. However, this would depend upon the\nvalue to the DNO associated with removing these events\nand the relative cost of competing solutions.\nTo establish a business case for energy storage owner-\nship, a thorough understanding of the areas in which value\ncan be brought is required. The first step in this process\nis to evaluate the technical benefits that can be achieved.\nThese benefits must then be attributed to all of the stake-\nholders in the electricity supply value chain. A picture of\nthe economic value accrued across all of the stakeholders\nis then possible. The techniques developed in this work al-\nlow investigation of how different modes of operation will\nchange the relative success of each technical benefit con-\nsidered, and therefore inform the overall economic value\nthat will be achieved in each case. This knowledge has di-\nrect consequences for the technical and commercial policy\nof the ESS operator (in this field trial this is the DNO)\nbut must also be recognised by ESS manufacturers, gov-\nernments and regulators in their policy development.\nAlthough this analysis has been carried out on an 11kV\ndistribution feeder, there are observations that can be car-\nried through to both higher and lower voltage levels. It is\nanticipated that plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) will be-\ncome widespread over the coming decades. If aspects of\nthe battery management system are made available to the\ndistribution network control system, then a massive op-\nportunity opens up for highly distributed electrical energy\n9\nPlease cite this article as: Wade, N.S., et al., Evaluating the benefits of an electrical energy storage\nsystem in a future smart grid.

The development of a multi-agent system to\ncoordinate similar tasks has been investigated by Lyons et\nal. (2010). If suitable control systems are put in place, sim-\nilar opportunities for network control to those presented in\nthis work become available, without the need to install a\ndedicated energy storage plant. On the other hand, mov-\ning up the voltage levels to 33kV, 66kV and 132kV where\npower flows are greater implies the installation of a much\nlarger storage device. This would open up further possibil-\nities for bringing benefits to network operation and begins\nto make it feasible to operate in short-term energy mar-\nkets and thus provide further value to ESS ownership. The\ntechniques that have been developed in this work are capa-\nble of assessing the benefits of energy storage at locations\nin the higher voltage network.\nSignificant changes to the methods used to control dis-\ntribution networks will result from the transition to the\nSmart Grid. Electrical energy storage is one of the tools\nthat will become increasingly available to network planners\nand operators. Greater visibility of the system state is nec-\nessary to enable sophisticated interventions that respond\nto network conditions remote from the point at which the\nESS is located. To achieve the greatest benefits from the\noperation of an ESS, installation must be part of a broader\nsmartening of the network with instrumentation and con-\ntrol equipment. As progress is made in the transition to\nfuture electricity networks, electrical energy storage em-\nbedded at distribution level is set to become an integral\npart of the Smart Grid.\nReferences\nArulampalam, A., Barnes, M., Jenkins, N., Ekanayake, J.
