H. M. THORNLEY. Centre for Ecology &\nHydrology,Bush Estate,Penicuik,Midlothian EH26\n0QB, UK\nAnalytical expressions for the sun and shade leaf\ncontributions to instantaneous canopy photosynthesis\nare derived (Thornley 2002). The analysis is based on\nfour assumptions. First, the canopy is closed in the\nsense that it is horizontally uniform. Second, there is\nan exponential profile of light down the canopy with\nthe same decay constant for light from different parts\nof the sky. Third, leaf photosynthetic response to\nincident irradiance can be described by a three-\nparameter non-rectangular hyperbola (NRH). And\nlast, light acclimation at the leaf level occurs in only\none parameter of the NRH, that describing light-\nsaturated photosynthetic rate, which is assumed\nproportional to the local averaged leaf irradiance.\nThese assumptions have been extensively researched\nempirically and theoretically and their limitations are\nquite well understood. They have been widely used\nwhere appropriate. Combining these assumptions\npermits the derivation of algebraic expressions for\ninstantaneous canopy photosynthesis which are com-\nputationally efficient because they avoid the necessity\nfor numerical integration down the canopy. These are\nvaluable for modelling plant and crop ecosystems, for\nwhich canopy photosynthesis is the primary driver.\nIgnoring the sun\u0001shade dichotomy can result in\noverestimates of canopy photosynthesis of up to\n20%, but using a rectangular hyperbola instead of\na NRH to estimate canopy photosynthesis taking\naccount of sun and shade leaves can lead to a similarly\nsized underestimate. It is suggested that the method\ncan be applied with confidence to situations that\nsatisfy the four assumptions. This includes many\ncrops and plant ecosystems. However, the model has\nnot been tested predictively ; such tests would be\ndifficult. Other work aimed at calculating canopy\nphotosynthesis has been reported by De Pury &\nFarquhar (1997), Kull & Kruijt (1998) and Wohlfahrt\net al. (1999). None of the suggested models has been\ntested definitively at the predictive level against obser-\nvational data, and some rest on uncertain theoretical\nfoundations.\nThis research has been supported by the European Union\nthrough the MEGARICH project and COST 619; it also\ncontributes to contract 1\u00011\u000164 of DEFRA.\nD\uf765 P\uf775\uf772\uf779, D.

Dynamic mechanistic\nmodels have proved more suitable for extrapolation,\nbut they remain computationally expensive and are\nnot applied easily in practical situations. The first\nobjective of this research focused on employing\nconventional techniques to generate statistical models\nof methane production appropriate to UK dairy\nsystems. The second objective was to evaluate these\nmodels and a model published previously using both\nUK and North American data sets. Thirdly, non-\nlinear models were considered as alternatives to the\nconventional linear regressions. The UK calorimetry\ndata used to construct the linear models were also\nused to develop the three non-linear alternatives\nthat were all of modified Mitscherlich form;\ny\u0001 a\u0002(a\u0003b)e\u2212cx where a and b are the maximum\nand minimum values, respectively, of y, and c affects\nthe shape of y. Of the linear models tested, Moe &\nTyrrell (1979) proved most reliable across the full\nrange of evaluation data [root Mean Square Pre-\ndiction Error (MSPE) 21\u00043% of observed mean].\nHowever, the Mitscherlich models demonstrated the\ngreatest degree of adaptability across diet types and\nintake level. The most successful model for simulating\nthe independent data was a Mitscherlich equation\nwith the shape parameter set to represent dietary\nstarch to acid detergent fibre ratio (rootMSPE 17\u00049%\nof observed mean). Although, where such data were\nunavailable, simpler Mitscherlich forms relating dry\nmatter or metabolizable energy intake to methane\nproduction remained better alternatives relative to\ntheir linear counterparts.\nDEFRA is thanked for funding this research through\nproject WA0320.\nAbstracts of Communications 105\nM\uf76f\uf765, P.

TUCK.\nIACR-Rothamsted, Harpenden, Hertfordshire AL5\n2JQ, UK\nPhosphate is lost from arable land either dissolved in\nwater draining from the soil or carried on detached\nsoil material. The PSALM (Phosphate Sorption And\nLoss Model) simulates both modes of loss. The\nconcentration of phosphate in water passing through\nthe matrix of the soil is determined in the model by\nrapid sorption or desorption described by the Freund-\nlich equation and a time-dependent pseudo-diffusive\nprocess. By-pass flow occurs when rainfall exceeds a\ncritical amount determined daily in the model, and\nthis carries both dissolved phosphate and phosphate\non detached soil material from the top layer to the\nbase of the profile without any interaction with the\nsoil matrix. This by-pass-flow could become overland\nflow with only very minor modifications to the model.\nThe amount of phosphate-carrying detached material\ndepends on the clay content and wetness of the soil\nand the amount of rain; the intensity of the rain\nshould ideally be used, but data are often not available.\nThe model takes account of primary and secondary\ntillage, crop uptake and mineralization, but does not\ndiscriminate at present between inorganic and organic\nphosphate.\nBecause of the nature of the Freundlich equation,\nthe relation between the loss of soluble phosphate\nsimulated by the model and the Freundlich sorption\nparameter is strongly non-linear. This non-linearity\ninteracts with any (statistical) error in the parameter\n(Addiscott & Tuck 2001), which means that the loss\nof soluble phosphate depends on its standard error as\nwell as its mean. The model was evaluated against the\nphosphate losses measured in drainage from plots of\nthe Broadbalk experiment by Heckrath et al. (1995).\nThe simulations of soluble phosphate concentrations\nin drainage were good: those of phosphate carried on\ndetached soil material were somewhat poorer but\nstatistically acceptable. These simulations depended\non the assumption that the drainage did not interact\nwith the subsoil.\nSimulations with the model suggested that omitting\nprimary (inversion) tillage on Broadbalk would cause\na small increase in losses of phosphate attached to soil\nmaterial but a much larger decrease in losses of\ndissolved phosphate.\nThis research was funded by DEFRA and the grant-in-aid\nreceived by IACR-Rothamsted from BBSRC.\nA\uf764\uf764\uf769\uf773\uf763\uf76f\uf774\uf774, T.

XANTHOPOULOS \uf761\uf76e\uf764\nJ. L.WOODS.Heat andMass Transfer Laboratory,\nDepartment of Agricultural and Environmental Sci-\nence, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne\nNE1 7RU, UK\nThe seasonal changes taking place inside a grain store\nare difficult and expensive to monitor, particularly\nmoisture and biological changes, such as mould\ngrowth and germination loss.Given current awareness\nof mould growth and toxins, and the need for\nminimizing pesticide use, there is a demand for an\nimproved understanding of physical control measures\n(e.g. interaction between winter aeration cooling and\nsummer surface heating). The computer program\npresented here and evaluated against existing data\nprovides a cost-effective approach to the problem.\nThe model predicts the axisymmetric distributions\nof temperature, moisture content, cumulative dry\nmatter loss (respiration) and germination loss in a\nvertical plane through the axis of a cylindrical silo.\nThe overall model presented by Xanthopoulos (2002)\nemployed non-linear and coupled balance equations\nfor energy and moisture. The energy equation\nincorporates two energy source terms (latent heat of\nvaporization and respiration heating), and the moist-\nure equation contains a moisture production term due\nto respiration. Respiration is calculated by the model\nof Jacobsen (2001). Germination is described by a\nprobit model (Woods et al. 1994). It is assumed that\nno natural convection occurs for small grains like\nwheat or barley. The model also assumes heat and\nmass transfer by molecular diffusion through the\nvoids during unaerated periods and enhanced diffu-\nsion due to aerodynamic dispersion during aeration.\nAt regular intervals, contour maps for the four\nvariables are drawn in real-time providing a dynamic\nvisualization.\nThe model was evaluated and used to investigate\nthe wet storage of rapeseed initially at 14% moisture\ncontent wet base (wb) and 20 \u0005C before drying, and\nthe long term storage of malting barley initially at\n12% moisture content wb and 30 \u0005C. Different fan\ncapacities and control algorithms were tested to\nminimize the dry matter loss in the first example and\nthe germination loss in the second.\nJ\uf761\uf763\uf76f\uf762\uf773\uf765\uf76e, E.

Initially, the\nintracellular free pool enrichments were assumed\nequal to those of milk protein, but this revealed\ninconsistencies. From the [\u0002H\n\u0003\n]Met movements [equa-\ntions (3) and (5)], the bypass (F\nva\n) was estimated as\n57% of F\nin\n, while the [\u0001\u0003C]Met data [equations (3) and\n(7)] gave a 74% bypass. This violates the assumption\nthat isotopic forms behave identically so other factors\nneed to be considered. The imbalances would arise if\nthe enrichment in milk underestimated that in the\nintracellular pool.DefiningE\nm\n\u0001 (1\u0003x)E\nm\n(observed)\nand EC\nm\n\u0001 (1\u0003x) EC\nm\n(observed), the inconsistencies\nwould disappear for 1\u0003x\u0001 1\u000428. Results (Table 1;\nflows, mmol Met\u0001h; enrichments, atom per cent\nexcess) for the full model, based on the adjusted milk\nenrichments, show thatHMB-derived [\u0001\u0003C]Met contri-\nbutes 15% to protein synthesis, of which 15% is\nderived from conversion in theMGwith the remainder\nderived from synthesis elsewhere in the body.\nDoes the estimated adjustment of 28% on milk\nenrichment make biological sense? Possible reasons\nfor a lower enrichment in milk than in the intracellular\npool include the 0\u00045 h taken for polypeptides to be\ntranslated, processed and secreted from mammary\ncells. Such a delay would yield a 6% difference. In\nAbstracts of Communications 107\naddition, incomplete previous milking will also lower\nthe enrichment.

Macaulay Land Use\nResearch Institute, Craigiebuckler, Aberdeen AB15\n8QH, UK\nCrop simulation models often require climate data as\ninput variables. Whilst precipitation and temperature\ndata are usually available, there is often a dearth of\nrepresentative solar radiation data in most countries.\nMethods are available to estimate solar radiation\nusing temperature data, or by conversion from\nsunshine duration. A method is described for con-\nversion of sunshine duration to solar radiation. An\nillustration is made of the spatial distribution of\nmeteorological stations with records of solar radiation\nand\u0001or sunshine duration in the UK. In the absence\nof site-specific data, the nearest meteorological station\ndata are often used to run models at a particular\nlocation. This paper compares sources of solar\nradiation data for the site-specific application of a\ncrop model (CropSyst) (Sto\u0001 ckle & Nelson 1998).\nThree methods of providing solar radiation data\nwere tested: conversion from sunshine duration; an\nun-parameterized Campbell\u2013Donatelli model used\nwithin CropSyst ; and the two nearest meteorological\nstations. Generic simulations of spring barley were\nrun with CropSyst for 13 separate years, using the\nthree sources of solar radiation data for three\ngeographically similar locations in southern England.\nSolar radiation predicted from sunshine duration was\ncompared with observed data using regression, giving\na mean R\u0002 of 0\u0004908. Crop yield output derived from\nthe three data sources was compared with results\nfrom observed solar radiation. For the three locations\ntested, the order of most suitable data source was:\nconversion of sunshine duration; nearest meteoro-\nlogical station; and the Campbell\u2013Donatelli model.\nThe nearest meteorological station does not necess-\narily give the best results. The results demonstrate\nthat crop models should use an appropriate source\nof solar radiation data. The results are discussed\nin the context of utilizing CropSyst within the\nLand Allocation Decision Support System (LADSS)\n(Matthews et al. 1999), a spatial multiple-objective\nland-use planning tool for considering farm-scale\nenvironmental, social and economic trade-offs.\nM\uf761\uf774\uf774\uf768\uf765\uf777\uf773, K.

P. YEATES,\nB. J. TOLKAMP \uf761\uf76e\uf764 I. KYRIAZAKIS. Animal\nBiology Division, Scottish Agricultural College,\nWest Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, UK\nAnimals offered a choice of two similar foods that\ndiffer in one dimension (e.g. protein content) select a\nconsistent combination of these foods in the long-\nterm. Long-term diet choice is, at least in the formal\nsense, the result of short-term feeding behaviour. The\nshortest unit of feeding that can be measured is often\na visit to a feeder supplying one food type only. With\nthe mixed distribution model developed by Yeates\net al. (2001) visits can be clustered into meals, and\nthese can be subjected to the analysis of diet choice.\nPrevious work led us to hypothesize that animals may\nattempt to select a consistent diet within a meal.\nIn three experiments, cows were offered a choice\nbetween high (H) and low (L) protein foods and visit\ndata were collected using computerized feeders. Cows\nselected a consistent non-random diet in the long term\nby visiting H feeders more frequently than L feeders.\nIf cows attempted to select a consistent diet within\nmeals then we expected to see a high frequency of\nmeals with a composition of visits similar to the long-\nterm average diet choice. To test this, the observed\nfrequency distribution of meal composition, in terms\nof the proportion of visits toH feeders, was calculated.\nSubsequently, the observed visits were randomly re-\nclustered into bouts using probability theory. These\nbouts represented the expected composition of the\nvisits within meals if cows did not regulate diet choice\nwithinmeals. Initially we assumed that the probability\nof visiting a feeder was dependent only on the food\ntype that it supplied, i.e. that all feeders supplying a\ngiven food were equally likely to be visited. However,\nsubsequent analysis showed that, within a meal, cows\nhad a higher probability of revisiting the feeder they\nhad just left. Therefore, the compositions of bouts\n108 ABSTRACTS OF COMMUNICATIONS\nwere recalculated to allow for this. We also investi-\ngated if cows attempted to regulate diet choice within\nmeals by adjusting their intake per visit depending on\nthe food type visited. To test this, we first calculated\nthe diet choice, as if this was not regulated within a\nmeal. Subsequently, differences between this and\nobserved diet choice were calculated and regressed on\nthe proportion of visits to H feeders. A significant\nnegative regression coefficient would provide evidence\nfor diet choice within meals.\nComparison of the frequency distributions of meals\nand random bouts, using chi-squared tests, provided\nno evidence that cows attempted to achieve their\nlong-term average diet choice within meals. Ad-\nditionally, we found no evidence that cows regulated\ndiet choice within meals by adjusting their intake per\nvisit depending on the food type that was consumed.\nIn conclusion, the tests conducted with the probability\ntheory model suggest that the timeframe over which\ndiet choice is regulated must be greater than a meal.\nY\uf765\uf761\uf774\uf765\uf773,M.

K. PAPASTAMATI, F. VAN\nDEN BOSCH, S. J. WELHAM, B. D. L. FITT,\nN. EVANS \uf761\uf76e\uf764 J. M. STEED. IACR-Rothamsted,\nHarpenden, Hertfordshire AL5 2JQ, UK\nLight leaf spot on winter oilseed rape is an econ-\nomically important disease in the UK. Understanding\nhow epidemics develop and are affected by weather\nconditions is crucial for forecasting purposes.\nPrevious work by Papastamati et al. (2001) used a\nsimple weather threshold for infection to occur and\nthe latent period between infection and sporulation\nwas constant. However, it has been shown that in field\nconditions latent period can vary between 150\u2013250\ndegree-days (Figeuroa et al. 1995). More recently,\nGilles et al. (2001) developed a model to describe\ntemperature and wetness effects in controlled en-\nvironment experiments on the development of light\nleaf spot.\nThe progress of light leaf spot epidemics on winter\noilseed rape was monitored in 1998\u000199 and 1999\u00012000\nat Rothamsted, and weather factors and P. brassicae\nascospore concentrations were recorded daily. A\nstructured population model was developed to in-\nvestigate the effects of presence of inoculum (asco-\nspores and conidiospores) and weather factors on the\nprogress of light leaf spot on winter oilseed rape\nleaves and improve a previous model (Papastamati et\nal. 2001). New susceptible leaves are produced and\nleaf birth rate is assumed to be linearly dependent on\ntemperature. The infection criterion depends on\ntemperature and leaf wetness duration (expressed as\nrain duration) and the length of the latent period is\ntemperature-dependent.Model parameters are related\nto rates of infection of \u2018susceptible leaves \u2019, sporulation\nof \u2018 infected leaves \u2019 to produce \u2018sporulating leaves \u2019\nand death of leaves from these three compartments\nand were estimated by fitting the model to the data\nsets. The model fitted the disease progress data\nequally well in both seasons. The model fitting\nsuggested that disease progress could be described\nonly if both ascospore and conidiospore numbers\nwere included. The fit to the data was better in\n1999\u00012000 than in 1998\u000199. An assumption that the\nleaf birth rate changed around the time stem extension\nbegan (growth stage 2,0) improved the fit of the\nmodel. Seasonal variations in temperature had a large\neffect on the length of the latent period, which\nincreased when mean daily temperatures were less\nthan 5 \u0005C.\nF\uf769\uf767\uf765\uf775\uf772\uf76f\uf761, L., F\uf769\uf774\uf774, B.

However, methods that exploit these\nopportunities need to be developed. In particular, an\nintegrated weather\u0001crop forecasting model needs to\ncombine seasonal weather forecasting models, that\ncommonly operate spatial scales of about 200 km,\nwith crop simulation models usually run at the field\nscale. A method for developing combined seasonal\nAbstracts of Communications 109\nweather and crop forecasting has been proposed. The\nfirst stage of this is the determination of the spatial\nscale(s) on which the system operates by using\nhistorical records of weather and crop yields. This\nwas undertaken for groundnut productivity across\nIndia. Rainfall is the dominant climatic factor\ndetermining groundnut yield in India. Total seasonal\nrainfall accounted for 52% of the variance in yield as\nan all-India average over the period 1966 to 1990.\nHowever, this correlation became more variable (and\nsometimes not significant) when examined separately\nfor each of 17 subdivisions of India. Therefore, the\nspatial structure of the relationship between rainfall\nand groundnut yields was examined using Empirical\nOrthogonal Function analysis. Using the subdivi-\nsional data, a coherent, large scale pattern emerged\nfor both rainfall and yield. On this scale (\b 300 km)\nthe first Principal Component (PC) of rainfall was\ncorrelated with the first PC of yield (R\u0002\u0001 0\u000453,\nP\t 10\u2212\u0004). Development of a combined weather\u0001crop\nforecasting system can now proceed at the spatial\nscale at which this relationship has been established.\nThe first PCs for yield at the district scale (\b 30 km)\nand at the subdivisional scale were highly correlated\n(R\u0002\u0001 0\u000496). Further, the first PC of subdivisional\nyield correlated (R\u0002\u0001 0\u000445) with a PC for a seasonal\nlarge-scale circulation pattern over India (identified\nby Sperber et al. 2000). This establishes a link\nfrom the patterns of district scale crop yields through\nto the large-scale circulation patterns associated with\nrainfall variations across India.\nThis research was funded by The University of Reading\nResearch Endowment Trust Fund.\nS\uf770\uf765\uf772\uf762\uf765\uf772, K.

Biomathematics Unit,\nIACR-Rothamsted, Harpenden, Hertfordshire AL5\n2JQ, UK\nThe functions of social behaviour among animals are\nextremely diverse, with both beneficial and harmful\nconsequences. One proposed function is the pre-\nvention of epidemics where it is believed that spatial\nsegregation could play a significant part in reducing\ndisease epidemics.\nHere, a spatial model for two interacting groups of\nthe same species is presented which allows for the\nbehaviour between susceptible and infected indivi-\nduals in each group to vary. This is an important\nfeature since field studies indicate that infected animals\ndisplay a significantly different behaviour from that\nof healthy individuals. Namely, in a study of tuber-\nculosis (M. bovis) amongst the badger population,\nCheeseman & Mallison (1982) observed that some of\nthe infected badgers displayed signs of very restrictive\nmovement. On the other hand, some cases were\nobserved where infected badgers exhibited loss of fear\nof humans and cars followed by increased random\nmovements. Similar observations have also been\nfound in foxes infected with rabies (Kaplan 1977;\nBacon 1985).\nA system of coupled non-linear reaction\u2013convec-\ntion\u2013diffusion equations is considered, with reaction\nfunctions describing within- and between-group inter-\nactions and disease dynamics. The work focuses on\nthe question of how the different behaviours of sus-\nceptible and infected individuals and the strength of\nthe contact rate between the groups affect the levels\nof susceptible population that survive the disease. It\nalso investigates the role of the birth parameter in\nformation and destruction of spatial structure as a\nresponse to disease outbreak. Examples and ecological\nexplanations will be given.\nAlthough this is essentially a theoretical study,\napplications could be envisaged in agriculture, since\nmany feral populations become segregated for part of\nthe year, acting as reservoirs for the disease and\nposing a threat to livestock.\nThis research was conducted while IB was working in the\nDepartment of Mathematics, University of Bath, UK, and\nwas funded by an ORS grant and a Bath University\nScholarship.\nB\uf761\uf763\uf76f\uf76e, P.

Food Safety Science\nDivision, Institute of Food Research, Norwich\nResearch Park, Norwich, Norfolk NR4 7UA, UK\nTheory, developed recently, at IFR by Wilson et al.\n(2000) provides predictions of the pH of complex,\nbuffering systems in the presence of organic acids.\nOur computational scheme marries together the\nbehaviour of straightforward components (i.e. those\nthat can bemodelled using acid dissociation constants,\nK\na\n), with a simple empirical characterization of those\nparts of the system too complex to model in that way.\nWhere components of the system are able to partition\ninto a lipid phase (such as sorbic acid into oils), the\ntheory is able to predict pH changes caused by this\nbehaviour.\nTo verify the theory, the acid response behaviour of\na range of microbiological media was characterized\nby titration with a strong acid. A wide range of\nbuffering capacities were seen with, for example\nMan\u2013Rogosa\u2013Sharpe medium requiring approxi-\n110 ABSTRACTS OF COMMUNICATIONS\nmately ten times the concentration of strong acid to\nreduce the pH from 7 to 3 as compared with yeast-\nmalt medium. These characterizations were then used\nto predict response of themedia toweak acid additions\nusing the theory and published pK\na\nvalues for a\nnumber of weak acids. The media were then titrated\nwith these weak acids, and the results compared with\nour predictions. In all cases the predicted and\nmeasured values of pH were within experimental\nerror.\nThough most of our work to date has targeted\napplications in food systems and in experimental\nmicrobiology, we believe this theory has applications\nin the agricultural science arena too. Possible ap-\nplication areas could include changes in pH during\nsilage production, resulting from the production of\nacidic metabolites by the fermenting organisms; the\nprediction of buffering capacity of animal feed\nformulations and prediction of pH of soils in relation\nto soil remediation or acid precipitation.\nWe acknowledge DEFRA for funding this work.\nW\uf769\uf76c\uf773\uf76f\uf76e, P.

Reconciling sustainable farm incomes while\nachieving multiple environmental objectives presents\nan interesting modelling challenge.\nWe have combined environmental with technical\nand financial relationships in the Silsoe whole FARM\nsystemsMODel (SFARMMOD), including emissions\nof methane, phosphate, nitrate, ammonia and nitrous\noxide. The last three are part of the nitrogen cycle,\nwhich provides a difficult and important modelling\nchallenge, because of the many interactions, such as\nchoices of winter, spring and catch crops and nitrogen-\nbuilding crops.\nFarming systems with changing soil organic ni-\ntrogen status are unlikely to be truly sustainable. We\ntherefore quantify a complete mass balance of\nnitrogen over a rotation with no overall net change in\nsoil organic nitrogen. Most simulation models, how-\never, predict short-term N dynamics, so allowing soil\norganic nitrogen to change. We have adapted existing\nmodels to provide the necessary steady state in-\nformation.\nSFARMMOD is a strategic farm planning tool,\nwhich calculates cropping systems for optimal long-\nterm profitability, taking into account factors such as\nsoil workability, which are a function of soil type and\nclimate. It now also calculates the long-term con-\nsequences to whole-farm nitrogen cycles.\nData on environmental impacts have been derived\nfrom a variety of sources including the national\ninventories, as well as process models such as\nSUNDIAL for arable land (Smith et al. 1996) and N\nFix Cycle for grassland (Scholefield et al. 1991). The\nmodels (or their outputs) have been adapted as\nneeded to predict offtake and emissions in steady\nstate. Relationships were then derived to link them to\nthe decision variables ; N inputs, crop rotation, sowing\ndate and machinery systems as functions of rainfall\nand soil type.\nScenarios were created to study the outcomes of\npolicies to reduce ammonia emissions or nitrate\nleaching. These showed that increasing the value that\nthe farmer can confidently ascribe to the nutrients in\napplied manure (many farmers assume little nutrient\nvalue currently) is an ideal way to reduce N losses and\nincrease net profit. Measures required by the Inte-\ngrated Pollution Prevention and Control legislation\nreduce some emissions but increase others and the\ncost of compliance varies greatly with soil type.\nActions required to comply with Nitrate Vulnerable\nZones and The Code of Good Agricultural Practice\nfor the Protection of Water do not create a large\nnitrate leaching reduction above that obtained by\nfarmers adopting sound practices. However, farmer\nreactions to legislation could reduce even these effects\nby changing rotations to recover lost income, while\nstaying within regulations.\nThis research was funded by DEFRA, project number\nWA0801.\nS\uf763\uf768\uf76f\uf76c\uf765\uf766\uf769\uf765\uf76c\uf764, D., L\uf76f\uf763\uf76b\uf779\uf765\uf772, D.

These parameters\nalso form the basis of the American system (NRC\n2001) and traditionally have been estimated using\nlinear equations.\nA number of studies have highlighted concerns\nover current recommendations that are based on\nexperiments conducted over 30 years ago. Underlying\nthese concerns could be the rigid acceptance of linear\nmethods in analysing energy balance data from dairy\ncows. Therefore, a database of calorimetric data\ncontaining 435 records was constructed from experi-\nments conducted at the Agricultural Research In-\nstitute of Northern Ireland and The University of\nReading. Five functions were considered: a straight\nline, two diminishing returns equations (Mitscherlich\nand rectangular hyperbola) and two sigmoidals\n(logistic and Gompertz).\nBased on the definition of k\nl\nas the ratio of milk\nenergy derived from MEI to MEI directed towards\nmilk production, zero energy balances (\u00065 MJ) were\nused to estimate regression parameters to determine\nME\nm\nand k\nl\n. Positive and negative energy balance\ndata were used to estimate k\ng\nand k\nb\n, respectively.\nValues of 0\u000479 and 0\u000465 for k\ng\nand k\nb\n, respectively,\nwere obtained with each function. These were signifi-\ncantly different from previous reports of 0\u000460 to 0\u000475\nfor k\ng\nand 0\u000482 to 0\u000484 for k\nb\n. When all the data were\npooled, the average value for k\nl\nwas 0\u000461. Non-linear\nanalysis showed a decreasing value of k\nl\nas feeding\nlevel above maintenance increased. The linear model\nprovided a value of k\nl\nthat does not change with level\nof feeding. The rectangular hyperbola gave large\nstandard errors with its parameter estimates. The\nsigmoidals tended to underestimate milk energy at\nhigher level of feeding and the efficiency of utilization\nof energy for maintenance. Among the five functions\nconsidered, the Mitscherlich gave relatively lower\nstandard errors and the parameter estimates made\nbiological sense, and therefore this function is\nappropriate for the analysis of energy balance data.\nThis research was funded through MAFF LINK Project\nLK0604.\nA\uf767\uf772\uf769\uf763\uf775\uf76c\uf774\uf775\uf772\uf761\uf76c \uf761\uf76e\uf764 F\uf76f\uf76f\uf764 R\uf765\uf773\uf765\uf761\uf772\uf763\uf768 C\uf76f\uf775\uf76e\uf763\uf769\uf76c (1993).\nEnergy and Protein Requirements of Ruminants.
