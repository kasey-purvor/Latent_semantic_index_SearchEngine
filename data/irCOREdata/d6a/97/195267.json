We performed a joint analysis of two genomewide association \nstudies of coronary artery disease.\nMethods\nWe first identified chromosomal loci that were strongly associated with coronary ar-\ntery disease in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study (which \ninvolved 1926 case subjects with coronary artery disease and 2938 controls) and looked \nfor replication in the German MI [Myocardial Infarction] Family Study (which involved \n875 case subjects with myocardial infarction and 1644 controls). Data on other single-\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were significantly associated with coronary \nartery disease in either study (P<0.001) were then combined to identify additional loci \nwith a high probability of true association. Genotyping in both studies was performed \nwith the use of the GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set (Affymetrix).\nResults\nOf thousands of chromosomal loci studied, the same locus had the strongest as-\nsociation with coronary artery disease in both the WTCCC and the German studies: \nchromosome 9p21.3 (SNP, rs1333049) (P = 1.80\u00d710\u221214 and P = 3.40\u00d710\u22126, respectively). \nOverall, the WTCCC study revealed nine loci that were strongly associated with \ncoronary artery disease (P<1.2\u00d710\u22125 and less than a 50% chance of being falsely \npositive). In addition to chromosome 9p21.3, two of these loci were successfully \nreplicated (adjusted P<0.05) in the German study: chromosome 6q25.1 (rs6922269) \nand chromosome 2q36.3 (rs2943634). The combined analysis of the two studies \nidentified four additional loci significantly associated with coronary artery disease \n(P<1.3\u00d710\u22126) and a high probability (>80%) of a true association: chromosomes \n1p13.3 (rs599839), 1q41 (rs17465637), 10q11.21 (rs501120), and 15q22.33 (rs17228212).\nConclusions\nWe identified several genetic loci that, individually and in aggregate, substantially \naffect the risk of development of coronary artery disease.\nThe New England Journal of Medicine \nDownloaded from nejm.org at UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER on December 2, 2015.

By providing a detailed analysis of the \nWTCCC data in conjunction with data from an-\nother large genomewide association study, the \nGerman MI [Myocardial Infarction] Family Study, \nwe sought robust evidence for associations of \ngenetic loci with the risk of coronary artery dis-\nease and myocardial infarction.\nMe thods\nSubjects\nAll participants in both studies were of white Eu-\nropean origin. Detailed descriptions of recruitment \nand ascertainment in both studies are given in the \nSupplementary Appendix, available with the full \ntext of this article at www.nejm.org. Local ethics \ncommittees approved the study protocols, and all \nparticipants gave written informed consent.\nWTCCC Study\nThe 1988 case subjects in the WTCCC study had \na history of either myocardial infarction or coro-\nnary revascularization before the age of 66 years, \nas well as a strong family history of coronary ar-\ntery disease.6,7 Two independent control groups \nwere studied: 1504 controls from the British 1958 \nBirth Cohort and 1500 controls selected from a \nsample of blood donors recruited as part of the \nWTCCC project.5 \nGerman MI Family Study\nThe 875 case subjects in the German MI Family \nStudy were persons who had myocardial infarction \nbefore the age of 60 years and at least one first-\ndegree relative with premature coronary artery \ndisease.8,9 The 1644 controls were selected from \na well-characterized random sample of German \nresidents, stratified according to sex and age.10\nGenotyping\nAll analyses were performed with the use of the \nGeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set, in-\ncluding a StyI and a NspI chip. Details on geno-\ntype-calling algorithms, quality criteria (at the \nlevel of both the individual and the SNP), and \nvalidation steps are described in the Supplemen-\ntary Appendix. This left 377,857 SNPs in 1926 \ncase subjects and 2938 controls in the WTCCC \nstudy and 272,602 SNPs in 870 and 772 case sub-\njects for the StyI chip and the NspI chips, respec-\ntively, and from 1644 controls for both chips in \nthe German study.\nStatistical Analysis\nBefore performing the genetic analyses, we exam-\nined the data from each cohort individually for \npopulation substructure and ascertained that such \nvariation was negligible in both studies (see the \nSupplementary Appendix). We then undertook \nthree types of genetic analysis. First, after identi-\nfying the SNPs with the strongest associations \nwith coronary artery disease in the WTCCC sam-\nple, we sought to replicate these loci in the Ger-\nman study (primary analysis). Second, we com-\nbined data on other SNPs for which there was \nevidence of an association in either study, to iden-\ntify additional loci with a low probability of be-\ning falsely positive (combined analysis). Third, we \nexamined the data from both studies for associa-\ntions with coronary artery disease among SNPs \nin genes reported to be associated with this dis-\nease (candidate-gene analysis).\nPrimary Analysis\nAll autosomal SNPs that showed evidence of a \nsignificant association with coronary artery dis-\nn engl j med 357;5 www.nejm.org august 2, 2007\nThe New England Journal of Medicine \nDownloaded from nejm.org at UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER on December 2, 2015.

A small FPRP \nsuggests that the association of a SNP is unlikely \nto be a false positive result. A SNP with an FPRP \nof less than 0.5 (i.e., one for which the chance of \na truly positive association was greater than 50%), \nas well as SNPs within 100 kb in either direction \nof this SNP, also with P values of less than 0.001, \nwere considered to represent a single locus. For-\nmal replication testing of such loci was then per-\nformed in the German study with the use of the \nlead SNP (defined as the SNP with the lowest \nFPRP) for each locus and adjustment for multiple \ntesting. A P value of less than 0.05 with use of the \ntwo-sided Cochran\u2013Armitage trend test was con-\nsidered to indicate statistical significance. Hap-\nlotype analysis was carried out on replicated loci, \nas described in the Supplementary Appendix. \nThe power for replication in the German study \nwas estimated for each locus for an odds ratio for \nmyocardial infarction of 1.25 per allele and an \nadjusted significance level of 0.05.\nCombined Analysis\nAll SNPs that showed evidence of a significant \nassociation (P<0.001) with coronary artery dis-\nease in the WTCCC study or with myocardial in-\nfarction in the German study were combined to \nassess their combined FPRP. Pooled odds ratios \nfor the risk allele and 95% confidence intervals \nwere calculated within each stratum, according \nto the study.\nCandidate-Gene Analysis\nCandidate genes were identified as described in \nthe Supplementary Appendix. On the GeneChip \narray, we distinguished between SNPs that were \nidentical to those identified in previous studies \nas showing an association with coronary artery \ndisease and SNPs that were in complete or near-\ncomplete linkage disequilibrium with those iden-\ntified in previous studies as showing an associa-\ntion with coronary artery disease. We used either \nof two measures of linkage disequilibrium \u2014 an \nr2 value of 0.8 or more or a disequilibrium coef-\nficient (D\u2032) of 0.9 or more \u2014 on the basis of data \nfrom the International HapMap Project.12\nPopulation Attributable Fractions\nPopulation attributable fractions were estimated \nin the German study with the use of the lead SNP \nfrom each of the three replicated loci. Adjust-\nments were made for age, sex, the interaction \nbetween age and sex, the Prospective Cardiovas-\ncular Munster (PROCAM) study score, and the \nFramingham risk score. Further details are given \nin the Supplementary Appendix.\nData Access\nThe WTCCC data are accessible at www.wtccc.\norg.uk\/info\/summary_stats.shtml. The German \nMI Family Study data are available to academic \nresearchers in a Web-based database (www. \ncardiogenics.imbs-luebeck.de).\nR esult s\nCharacteristics of The Participants\nIn both the WTCCC and the German studies, the \ncase subjects were young (mean age at first event, \napproximately 50 years) and had a strong famil-\nial basis for their disease (Table 1).\nPrimary Analysis\nThe distribution of P values for the association of \nSNPs with coronary artery disease in the WTCCC \nstudy and with MI in the German Study, accord-\ning to chromosome, is shown in Figure 1. In the \nWTCCC study, 396 SNPs were significantly as-\nsociated with coronary artery disease (P<0.001). \nThirty of these SNPs clustering in nine chromo-\nsomal regions met the predefined criterion of an \nFPRP of less than 0.5 (Table 1 in the Supplemen-\ntary Appendix). We tested these nine loci for a \nsignificant association with myocardial infarc-\ntion in the German study. Three of the loci \u2014 \nchromosomes 9p21.3, 6q25.1, and 2q36.3 \u2014 had \nsuch an association, even after adjustment for \nmultiple testing for nine loci (Table 2).\nThe locus on chromosome 9p21.3 showed the \nstrongest signal in both the WTCCC and the \nGerman studies (P = 1.80\u00d710\u221214 and P = 3.40\u00d710\u22126, \nrespectively) (Fig. 1 and Table 2). The combined \nP value for the association with coronary artery \ndisease of the lead SNP in that locus, rs1333049, \nwas 2.91\u00d710\u221219, with the risk increased by 36% \nper copy of the C allele (95% confidence interval \n[CI], 27 to 46). Approximately 22% of the study \nparticipants were homozygous for this allele, with \nn engl j med 357;5 www.nejm.org august 2, 2007\nThe New England Journal of Medicine \nDownloaded from nejm.org at UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER on December 2, 2015.

In the \nWTCCC and German studies, a similar pattern \nof association with respect to direction and mag-\nnitude of effect was found across a region of ap-\nproximately 100 kb on 9p21.3 (Fig. 2). The 19 \nSNPs showing an association within this region \nwere in strong linkage disequilibrium. However, \ntwo blocks could be distinguished, with strong \nlinkage disequilibrium within each block (aver-\nage D\u2032>0.90) and moderate linkage disequilibri-\num between blocks (average D\u2032, approximately \n0.60) (Fig. 2). Three SNPs in block 1 (rs7044859, \nrs1292136, and rs7865618) and one SNP in block \n2 (rs1333049) were sufficient to tag the region. \nHaplotype analysis showed that the association \nwas mainly due to two mutually exclusive haplo-\ntypes for the four SNPs (TTGG and ACAC) (Sup-\nplementary Appendix). In the WTCCC study, the \nodds ratio for coronary artery disease with the \nACAC haplotype (frequency, 0.324 among con-\ntrols and 0.386 among case subjects), as compared \nwith the TTGG haplotype (frequency, 0.333 among \ncontrols and 0.271 among case subjects), was \n1.48 (95% CI, 1.34 to 1.64) per copy of the hap-\nlotype (P = 2.1\u00d710\u221214). The results of haplotype \nanalysis in the German study were similar (Sup-\nplementary Appendix).\nThe lead SNP on chromosome 6q25.1 \n(rs6922269, with a combined P value of 2.90\u00d710\u22128 \nfor the association with coronary artery disease) \nis in the gene for methylenetetrahydrofolate de-\nhydrogenase (NADP+-dependent) 1\u2013like protein \n(MTHFD1L). All positive SNPs in the region are \nlocated in introns in the middle portion of the \ngene (Fig. 1A in the Supplementary Appendix). \nThe risk allele (A) for rs6922269 has a prevalence \nof approximately 25%, with the risk increased \nby 23% per copy (95% CI, 15 to 33). Haplotype \nanalysis showed that only the two haplotypes \ncarrying the A allele were more frequent in case \nsubjects than in controls, confirming the in-\ncreased odds ratio for coronary artery disease \nwith the A allele in the single-locus analysis (Sup-\nplementary Appendix).\nThe third replicated locus, on chromosome \n2q36.3 (rs2943634, with a combined P value of \n1.61\u00d710\u22127 for the association with coronary artery \ndisease) encompasses a region of 233 kb (Fig. 1B \nin the Supplementary Appendix). There is only \none pseudogene (ENSG00000197218) located \nwithin this region. The risk allele (C) for rs2943634 \nhas a prevalence of approximately 65%, with the \nrisk increased by 21% per copy (95% CI, 13 to 30). \nHaplotype analysis showed that the other asso-\nciations observed in the linkage-disequilibrium \nblock around rs2943634 are due to linkage dis-\nequilibrium with it (Supplementary Appendix).\nThe association of the loci on chromosomes \n9p21.3 and 6q25.1 with myocardial infarction in \nthe German study was not affected by adjust-\nment for cardiovascular risk factors and scores. \nIn contrast, the odds ratio for myocardial infarc-\ntion at the locus on chromosome 2q36.3 was \nn engl j med 357;5 www.nejm.org august 2, 2007\nTable 1.

Further \nanalysis showed that this locus was also signifi-\ncantly related to the body-mass index (P = 0.004 \nin an additive model), the presence or absence of \nhypertension (P = 0.04), and the level of low-den-\nsity lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.03). The fully ad-\njusted population attributable fractions for the \nthree loci in the German study are shown in \nTable 2. The combined fraction for the three loci \nwas 0.38 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.55).

When sub-\njects with coronary artery disease only and those \nwith coronary artery disease and myocardial in-\nfarction were analyzed individually, the odds ra-\ntios for both phenotypes across all seven chro-\nmosomal regions remained significant (Table 4 \nin the Supplementary Appendix). For the chromo-\nsome 15 locus, the effect size was significantly \ngreater (P = 0.004) in the subgroup of patients \nwith coronary artery disease only than in the sub-\ngroup with coronary artery disease and myocar-\ndial infarction.

For the \nother genes, we identified 270 SNPs in complete \nor near-complete linkage disequilibrium with the \nSNPs that were previously found to be associated \nwith coronary artery disease or myocardial infarc-\ntion. Although a number of SNPs had a promis-\ning association with coronary artery disease in \nthe WTCCC study or with myocardial infarction \nin the German study, only two linked SNPs \n(rs17489268 and rs17411031) tagging the Ser447\u2192\nTer variant in the lipoprotein lipase gene had a \nsignificant association in both studies (Table 6 in \nthe Supplementary Appendix).\nDiscussion\nWe jointly analyzed data from two distinct but \ncomplementary genomewide association studies \nof coronary artery disease and myocardial infarc-\ntion that performed ascertainment in similar ways \nand that involved the same genotyping platform. \nSequential and combined analyses of the two \ndata sets allowed us to identify several new genetic \nloci, which individually and in aggregate consid-\nerably affect the risk of coronary artery disease.\nThe association of chromosome 9p21.3 with \ncoronary artery disease was the strongest found \nin the WTCCC study.5 The finding that this locus \nwas also most strongly associated with myocar-\ndial infarction in the German study provides com-\npelling proof of its involvement in coronary artery \ndisease. The evidence of association is strong, the \nrisk variant is common, and each copy of the \nallele substantially increases the probability of \nthe disease. These findings unequivocally dem-\nonstrate a major genetic risk variant at this locus.\nIndeed, during revision of this manuscript, \ntwo other genomewide studies reported a strong \nassociation of the same 9p21.3 locus with coro-\nnary artery disease and myocardial infarction,13,14 \nmaking this the most highly replicated locus \nfor coronary artery disease identified to date. \nThe region contains the coding sequences of \ngenes for two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, \nCDKN2A (encoding the prototypic INK4 protein \np16INK4a) and CDKN2B (encoding p15INK4b), \nwhich play an important role in the regulation \nof the cell cycle and may be implicated, through \ntheir role in TGF-\u03b2\u2013induced growth inhibition, \nin the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.15-17 Al-\nthough regulation of one or both of the CDKN2 \ngenes may explain the association with coronary \nn engl j med 357;5 www.nejm.org august 2, 2007\nTa\nbl\ne \n3.\n A\ndd\niti\non\nal\n L\noc\ni A\nss\noc\nia\nte\nd \nw\nith\n C\nor\non\nar\ny \nA\nrt\ner\ny \nD\nis\nea\nse\n fr\nom\n C\nom\nbi\nne\nd \nA\nna\nly\nsi\ns \nof\n D\nat\na \nfr\nom\n th\ne \nW\nTC\nC\nC\n a\nnd\n G\ner\nm\nan\n M\nI F\nam\nily\n S\ntu\ndi\nes\n.*\nC\nhr\nom\nos\nom\ne\nLe\nad\n S\nN\nP\nM\nin\nor\n A\nlle\nle\n  \nin\n C\non\ntr\nol\ns\nR\nis\nk \nA\nlle\nle\nW\nTC\nC\nC\n S\ntu\ndy\nG\ner\nm\nan\n S\ntu\ndy\nC\nom\nbi\nne\nd \nA\nna\nly\nsi\ns\nFP\nR\nP\nFr\neq\nue\nnc\ny \nof\n \nM\nin\nor\n A\nlle\nle\n \nam\non\ng \nC\non\ntr\nol\ns\nO\ndd\ns \nR\nat\nio\n  \nfo\nr \nR\nis\nk \nA\nlle\nle\n  \n(9\n5%\n C\nI)\nFr\neq\nue\nnc\ny \n \nof\n M\nin\nor\n A\nlle\nle\n \nam\non\ng \nC\non\ntr\nol\ns\nO\ndd\ns \nR\nat\nio\n  \nfo\nr \nR\nis\nk \nA\nlle\nle\n  \n(9\n5%\n C\nI)\nO\ndd\ns \nR\nat\nio\n  \nfo\nr \nR\nis\nk \nA\nlle\nle\n  \n(9\n5%\n C\nI)\nP \nV\nal\nue\n1\nrs\n59\n98\n39\nG\nA\n0.\n23\n1.\n24\n (\n1.\n12\n\u20131\n.3\n8)\n0.\n22\n1.\n39\n (\n1.\n19\n\u20131\n.6\n3)\n1.\n29\n (\n1.\n18\n\u20131\n.4\n0)\n4.\n05\n\u00d71\n0\u2212\n9\n0.\n00\n06\n1\nrs\n17\n46\n56\n37\nA\nC\n0.\n29\n1.\n23\n (\n1.\n12\n\u20131\n.3\n4)\n0.\n26\n1.\n15\n (\n1.\n01\n\u20131\n.3\n2)\n1.\n20\n (\n1.\n12\n\u20131\n.3\n0)\n1.\n27\n\u00d71\n0\u2212\n6\n0.\n13\n14\n10\nrs\n50\n11\n20\nC\nT\n0.\n13\n1.\n24\n (\n1.\n09\n\u20131\n.4\n1)\n0.\n16\n1.\n54\n (\n1.\n28\n\u20131\n.8\n6)\n1.\n33\n (\n1.\n20\n\u20131\n.4\n8)\n9.\n46\n\u00d71\n0\u2212\n8\n0.\n02\n34\n15\nrs\n17\n22\n82\n12\nC\nC\n0.\n30\n1.\n19\n (\n1.\n09\n\u20131\n.3\n0)\n0.\n26\n1.\n26\n (\n1.\n11\n\u20131\n.4\n4)\n1.\n21\n (\n1.\n13\n\u20131\n.3\n0)\n1.\n98\n\u00d71\n0\u2212\n7\n0.\n01\n78\n* \nLo\nci\n s\nho\nw\nn \nar\ne \nth\nos\ne \nw\nith\n a\n fa\nls\ne-\npo\nsi\ntiv\ne-\nre\npo\nrt\n p\nro\nba\nbi\nlit\ny \n(F\nPR\nP)\n o\nf l\nes\ns \nth\nan\n 2\n0%\n, e\nxc\nlu\ndi\nng\n t\nho\nse\n s\nho\nw\nn \nin\n T\nab\nle\n 2\n.

The same region has also recently been \nassociated with increased susceptibility to type 2 \ndiabetes,18-20 raising the possibility of a shared, \nrather than a single, mechanism causing both \ncoronary artery disease and diabetes.\nThe association of chromosome 6q25.1 with \ncoronary artery disease maps to the MTHFD1L \ngene, which encodes the mitochondrial isozyme \nof C1-tetrahydrofolate (THF) synthase.21,22 The \nfamily of C1-THF synthases is used in a variety \nof cellular processes, particularly the synthesis \nof purine and methionine.21 Therefore, MTHFD1L \nactivity may also contribute to plasma homocys-\nteine levels,21,23 raising the possibility of a link \nbetween MTHFD1L variants and this risk factor \nfor coronary artery disease.24 A preliminary anal-\nysis of data from 1070 persons in the AtheroGene \nstudy25 has not revealed an association between \nrs6922269 genotypes and plasma homocysteine \nlevels (Tiret L, Blankenberg S: personal commu-\nnication). Nevertheless, further studies in a wider \nrange of subjects are needed to investigate this \npossibility.\nOur findings demonstrate the main strength \nof a genomewide approach \u2014 namely, the pos-\nsibility of identifying hitherto unsuspected loci \nthat increase susceptibility to complex diseases. \nHowever, the mechanisms underlying the newly \nidentified associations are often not immedi-\nately obvious. Indeed, the mechanisms for the \nassociation of signals on chromosomes 9p21.3, \n6q25.1, and 2q36.3 with coronary artery disease \nall require elucidation. Similarly, none of the chro-\nmosomal loci identified in the combined analy-\nsis have previously been strongly linked to coro-\nnary artery disease. However, genes in several of \nthe loci (PSRC1 at 1p13.3, MIA3 at 1q41, and \nSMAD3 at 15q22.33) play a role in cell growth or \ninhibition.26-29 These processes are fundamental \nfor the formation and progression of atheroscle-\nrotic plaque and also for plaque instability.30 Our \nresults suggest that genetic regulation of these \nprocesses plays an important role in the develop-\nment of coronary artery disease and myocardial \ninfarction.\nSome loci from the WTCCC study that we at-\ntempted to replicate did not show association in \nthe German study. These negative data under-\nscore the need to view genomewide associations \nwith caution, despite their statistical strength, un-\ntil they have been replicated in appropriate vali-\ndation samples. In this context, caution should \nalso be exercised with regard to the four loci \nidentified in our combined analysis.31\nOur primary objective was to identify loci with \nsignificant associations with coronary artery dis-\nease independently of any biologic assumptions. \nNonetheless, the genotyping platform also offered \nan opportunity to examine genetic variants in \ngenes with previously reported associations. In-\ndeed, several showed evidence of an association \nin one of our studies. However, only SNPs in the \nlipoprotein lipase gene had evidence of an asso-\nciation in both studies. This finding is in agree-\nment with those in most recent systematic studies \nthat were largely unsuccessful in replicating ini-\ntial findings in candidate genes.32 However, many \nof the previously studied gene variants are poorly \ntagged on the GeneChip array, which clearly fails \nto cover the full extent of even common variation \nin these genes.\nWhether our findings can be translated into \nbetter prevention or treatment for coronary artery \ndisease will become clear only over time and with \nfurther research. Although the odds ratios for \neach locus are modest, as anticipated for a poly-\ngenic disorder, the estimates of population attrib-\nutable fractions for the three validated loci are \nsubstantial, both individually and in aggregate. \nThis observation offers the potential for improved \noverall coronary risk prediction. However, the \ncase subjects in both studies had a strong fam-\nily history of premature coronary artery disease, \nwhich might have enhanced the power to detect \nan association with coronary artery disease but \nalso might have increased the estimated popula-\ntion attributable risks beyond that of sporadic \ncases, and further analysis of the loci in a wider \nrange of subjects is necessary. Further studies \nare also needed to investigate the associations of \nthe loci with other types of atherosclerotic dis-\nease, as well as with cardiovascular risk factors \nand markers. At a genetic level, studies should \nfocus on fine mapping of the associated regions \nand thorough investigation of candidate genes. \nOur results provide a framework for all these ad-\nditional studies.\nOur analysis has several important limitations. \nAlthough the GeneChip array typed over 500,000 \nvariants, a substantial percentage could not be \nn engl j med 357;5 www.nejm.org august 2, 2007\nThe New England Journal of Medicine \nDownloaded from nejm.org at UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER on December 2, 2015.

Furthermore, to reduce the effect \nof multiple testing, we used only the rather con-\nservative Cochran\u2013Armitage test for trend (an \nadditive model) to screen the WTCCC data for \nsignificant associations. These limitations make \nit likely that some loci were missed and that fur-\nther analysis of the data and subsequent valida-\ntion will reveal other loci.\nNonetheless, by using a sequential strategy of \ninitial replication and subsequent combination of \ninformation from the two genomewide associa-\ntion studies, we were able to describe several new \ngenetic loci for coronary artery disease and myo-\ncardial infarction that have a considerable effect \non the risk of these diseases and that merit in-\ndepth follow-up studies. Most important, the find-\ning that a single locus was the strongest signal \nin two separate studies carries promise for clini-\ncally relevant progress in our understanding of \nthe genetics of coronary artery disease. As the \ncurrent activity in genomewide association stud-\nies of complex traits accelerates, our approach \nmay also provide a paradigm for combining the \nresults of such studies to maximize the amount \nof valuable information that can be extracted \nfrom these expensive and laborious experiments.\nSupported by grants from the Wellcome Trust, the National \nGenome Research Network 2 of the German Federal Ministry of \nEducation and Research, and the Cardiogenics project of the \nEuropean Union.
