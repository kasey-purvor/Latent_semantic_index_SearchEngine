Here we have assessed whether receptor function of the M1 \nsubtype (CHRM1) is altered in a sub-population of subjects with schizophrenia, defined by \nmarked (60-80%) reductions in cortical [3H]-pirenzepine (PZP) binding, and termed \u2018muscarinic \nreceptor-deficit schizophrenia\u2019 (MRDS).  Using a [35S]-GTP\u03b3S-G\u03b1q\/11 immunocapture method \nwe have assessed whether CHRM1 signalling in human cortex (BA9) is altered in post-mortem \ntissue from a MRDS group compared with a subgroup of subjects with schizophrenia displaying \nnormal PZP binding, and control subjects with no known history of psychiatric or neurological \ndisorders.  The CHRM agonist (oxotremorine-M) and a CHRM1-selective agonist (AC-42) \nincreased G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding, with AC-42 producing responses that were ~50% of those \nmaximally evoked by the full agonist oxotremorine-M in control and sub-groups of subjects with \nschizophrenia.  However, the potency of oxotremorine-M to stimulate G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S \nbinding was significantly decreased in the MRDS group (pEC50 (M) = 5.69 \u00b1 0.16) compared to \nthe control group (6.17 \u00b1 0.10) and the non-MRDS group (6.05 \u00b1 0.07).  The levels of G\u03b1q\/11 \nprotein present in BA9 did not vary with diagnosis.  Maximal oxotremorine-M-stimulated G\u03b1q\/11-\n[35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding in BA9 membranes was significantly increased in the MRDS group \ncompared to the control group.  Similar, though non-statistically significant trends were observed \nfor AC-42.  These data provide evidence that both orthosterically- and allosterically-acting \nCHRM agonists can stimulate a receptor-driven functional response ([35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding to \nG\u03b1q\/11) in membranes prepared from post-mortem human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of \nsubjects with schizophrenia and control subjects.  Furthermore, in sub-group of subjects with \nschizophrenia displaying markedly decreased PZP binding (MRDS) we have demonstrated that \nwhile agonist potency may decrease, the efficacy of CHRM1-G\u03b1q\/11 coupling is increased, \nsuggesting an adaptative change in receptor-G protein coupling efficiency in this endophenotype \nof subjects with schizophrenia. \n \nKeywords: Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRM); G\u03b1q\/11 protein; schizophrenia; [3H]-\npirenzepine binding; human brain tissue \n 3\nINTRODUCTION \n \nSchizophrenia is a complex syndrome defined by the presence of positive and negative \nsymptoms, as well as cognitive dysfunction (Pantelis et al., 1999; Raedler et al., 2007).  Post-\nmortem studies (Dean et al., 1996; Crook et al., 2000; Zavitsanou et al., 2004; Deng and Huang, \n2005; Scarr et al., 2007), and a recent neuroimaging study (Raedler, 2007), have consistently \nshown that widespread decreases in the levels of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM) \noccur in the CNS of subjects with schizophrenia.  Significantly, protein and mRNA levels for the \nM1 (CHRM1; Dean et al., 2002; Mancama et al., 2003), but not the M4 (CHRM4; Dean et al., \n2002) or M2\/M3 (CHRM2\/CHRM3; Scarr et al., 2006) subtypes, have been shown to be \ndecreased in the frontal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia.  These data support the hypothesis \nthat decreases in the binding of the CHRM subtype-selective antagonist [3H]-pirenzepine reflect \ndecreases in the CHRM1 in the frontal cortex of subjects with the disorder.  \n \nIn other syndromes, such as diabetes (Gale, 2001), the ability to sub-divide subjects into \nbiologically more homogenous groups using biological markers has often underpinned the \nbeginnings of defining the pathologies of different diseases within the syndrome.  Therefore, it is \nhighly significant that it has recently been reported that a distinct sub-population of subjects with \nschizophrenia can be defined that have a 60-80% reduction in cortical [3H]-pirenzepine binding \n(Scarr et al 2008).  This low [3H]-pirenzepine binding sub-group has been defined as having \n\u2018muscarinic receptor-deficit schizophrenia\u2019 (MRDS) (Scarr et al., 2008).  To date, it has not been \npossible to determine if changes in CHRM1 density in the CNS of subjects with schizophrenia is \nassociated with a change in receptor function; something that might be predicted to occur in \nMRDS subjects, given the marked down-regulation of CHRM1 protein within this sub-group.  \n \nCHRM1 couples preferentially to heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gq\/11 sub-family to exert the \nmajority of its cellular actions (Caulfield and Birdsall, 1998).  This involves the activated, ligand-\nbound receptor interacting with a Gq\/11 protein to facilitate GTP-for-GDP exchange on the G\u03b1q\/11 \nsubunit.  In the presence of a radiolabelled, non-hydrolysable GTP analogue [35S]guanosine-5'-O-\n(3-thio)triphosphate ([35S]-GTP\u03b3S), the receptor will facilitate the binding of [35S]-GTP\u03b3S to \n 4\nGq\/11 proteins and by immunoprecipitating G\u03b1q\/11 subunits using specific antibodies it is possible \nto quantify the transduction of receptor activation to a proximal downstream step in the signal \ntransduction pathway (DeLapp et al., 1999).  By using a novel adaptation of this method, [35S]-\nGTP\u03b3S-G\u03b1q\/11 immunocapture (Salah-Uddin et al., 2008), it is now possible to measure G \nprotein-coupled receptor-G\u03b1q\/11 coupling in membranes prepared from human post-mortem tissue \nto assess agonist potency and efficacy.  Here, this technique has been used to determine whether \nagonist-dependent CHRM1 signalling in human cortex (Brodmann Area 9) is altered in tissue \nfrom subjects with MRDS compared to that in other forms of schizophrenia (non-MRDS), and \nsubjects with no known history of psychiatric or neurological disorders (control subjects).  Our \ndata indicate that while CHRM agonist potency is decreased in MRDS, there is an increase in the \nefficacy of CHRM1-Gq\/11 coupling.  These new data indicate that despite marked declines in \nCHRM1 expression in some subjects with schizophrenia, the ability of this receptor to initiate \nsignal transduction via Gq\/11 proteins is undiminished.  \n \n  \n 5\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nMaterials \n[35S]-GTP\u03b3S (1000\u20131200 Ci mmol-1) and anti-rabbit-IgG-coated SPA beads (RPNQ0016) were \nobtained from GE Healthcare.  Complete protease inhibitor cocktail was purchased from Roche \nApplied Science. All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.  The \nGq\/11\u03b1 antiserum was generated (against the C-terminal sequence (C)LQLNLKEYNLV) as \npreviously described (Akam et al., 2001).  AC-42 (4-n-butyl-1-[4-(2-methylphenyl)-4-oxo-1-\nbutyl]-piperidine hydrogen chloride) was synthesized by GlaxoSmithKline, Harlow, U.K. \n \nTissue Collection \nApproval was granted for tissue acquisition and use in this study by the Ethics Committee of the \nVictorian Institute of Forensic Medicine and the North Western Mental Health Programme \nBehavioural and Psychiatric Research and Ethics Committee, and consent for use of the samples \nfor research purposes was approved by the donor's relatives.  Blocks of tissue containing BA9 \nwere excised from the left hemisphere of subjects, who were retrospectively defined as having \nMRDS or non-MRDS, as well as age\/sex-matched control subjects (See Table 1).  BA9 was \ntaken as the region of the CNS on the lateral surface of the frontal lobe and includes the middle \nfrontal gyrus superior to the inferior frontal sulcus. \n \nAs part of the clinical assessment using the Diagnostic Instrument for Brain Studies (DIBS) (Hill \net al., 1999), a number of parameters were calculated.  PMI was calculated as the time from death \nto autopsy when deaths were witnessed.  In cases where death was witnessed, the time between \ndeath and autopsy was taken as the post-mortem interval (PMI).  In the latter case, tissue was \nonly taken from individuals who had been seen alive up to 5 h before being found dead, and PMI \nwas taken as the interval halfway between the donor being found dead and last being seen alive.  \nIn all cases, cadavers were refrigerated within 5 h of being found and tissue was rapidly frozen to \n-70\u00b0C within 30 min of autopsy.  The pH of the CNS tissue was measured as described \npreviously (Kingsbury et al., 1995).  When available, post-mortem toxicology was reviewed to \nexclude recent substance misuse and levels of antipsychotic and anti-cholinergic drugs in blood \n 6\nwere recorded.  Duration of illness (DOI) was calculated as the time from first contact with a \npsychiatric clinical service to death.  The most recently prescribed anti-psychotic and anti-\ncholinergic drugs and their final recorded prescribed doses were recorded and converted to \nstandardized drug doses (see Supplementary Table). \n \nDiagnostic Evaluation \nFor a subject to be included in this study, sufficient information needed to be available from \nclinical case records to enable a psychologist and psychiatrist to reach a diagnostic consensus \nusing the DIBS and thus be able to make a diagnoses according to DSM-IV criteria (American \nPsychiatric Association., 1994).  Subjects with schizoaffective disorder were excluded.  \n \n[3H]-Pirenzepine Binding \nIn situ radioligand binding and autoradiography were performed using five 20 \u03bcm frozen tissue \nsections from each block of BA9.  The binding of [3H]-pirenzepine (15 nM) was measured in the \npresence (non-specific binding (NSB): two sections) or absence (total binding: three sections) of \n1 \u03bcM quinuclidinyl xanthene-9-carboxylate hemioxalate (Dean et al., 1996) after incubation in 10 \nmM KH2PO4, 10 mM Na2HPO4; pH 7.4 (buffer A) at 25 \u00b0C for 30 min.  Sections were washed \ntwice for 2 min in ice-cold buffer A, dipped in ice-cold water and thoroughly dried prior to being \nfixed overnight in paraformaldehyde fumes in a desiccator.  The sections, and a set of [3H]-\nmicro-scales\u2122, were apposed against a BAS-TR2025 imaging plate until an image of appropriate \nintensity was obtained for scanning in the BAS 5000 phosphoimager.  Exposure time related to \nboth the density of binding sites and the specific activity of the radioligand were utilized.  The \nintensity of the phosphoimages was then measured by comparison to the intensity of the blocks \nof radioactivity on the [3H]-microscales using AIS image analysis software, with results being \nexpressed as d.p.m. mg-1 estimated wet weight tissue equivalents (ETE) and then converted to \nfmol mg-1 ETE.  In this way, [3H]-pirenzepine binding was measured using a single point \nsaturation analysis, which provides a good approximation of the density of radioligand binding \nsites in tissue sections (Dean et al., 2002). \n \n \n 7\nWestern Blotting \nTissue samples from Brodmann area 9 (BA9) were solubilized in sample buffer containing 1% \nSDS, 1 mM Na3VO4 and 10 mM Tris\/HCl, pH 7.5.  Proteins were loaded (25 \u00b5g well-1) in \nduplicate on to 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels and resolved by gel electrophoresis for 1 h at 150 \nV. Gels were then equilibrated in Towbin\u2019s transfer buffer (Tris\/glycine\/methanol) for 15 min.  \nProteins were then transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at \n100 V in Towbin\u2019s buffer.  Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-\nbuffered saline\/0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing 5% non-fat milk powder and then incubated \novernight at 4 \u00b0C in 7.5 mL TBS-T containing rabbit anti-G\u03b1q\/11 (1:500 dilution).  The next day, \nmembranes were washed 3 x 5 min in TBS-T at room temperature and incubated for 2 h at room \ntemperature in TBS-T containing Dako goat anti-rabbit IgG:HRP-conjugated secondary antibody \ndiluted 1:2000.  Membranes were washed 3 x 5 min in TBS-T at room temperature and incubated \nfor a further 5 min at room temperature in SuperSignal ECL solution (Pierce).  Excess solution \nwas drained and blotted and a single 5 min exposure was captured using a 440CF Kodak imaging \nstation. Band (~43 KDa) intensity is reported as a ratio to an internal control. A representative \nWestern Blot of relative G\u03b1q\/11 levels in a control subject and a subject with schizophrenia is \nshown in Figure 5b. Prior to measuring G\u03b1q\/11 in the cases, sufficient protein homogenate \n(Internal Control: IC) was prepared from the frontal cortex of a subject with no history of \npsychiatric or neurological illness. Aliquots of this homogenate were run in each of 12 wells on 2 \ngels (24 samples over all), and the OD of each immunopositive G\u03b1q\/11 band was measured as \ndescribed above. These experiments revealed that the anti-human G\u03b1q\/11 antibody bound to a \nCNS protein of appropriate molecular weight.  Moreover, using data from the IC, both the inter- \nand intra-gel variation for the measurement of G\u03b1q\/11 was shown < 15%.  Subsequently, a \nsample of IC was included in two lanes of each subsequent gel on which protein from samples \nwere separated and the OD of each sample was expressed as a ratio of the IC to control for gel to \ngel variation in our analyses (Dean et al., 2002). \n \nMembrane Preparation  \nBA9 of each individual donor, was homogenized using a Polytron in 10 volumes of 10 mM \nHEPES, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10% sucrose and complete \n 8\nprotease inhibitor cocktail.  The resultant homogenate was diluted 10-fold and centrifuged at \n1,000 xg for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, the supernatant saved and the pellet re-homogenized and centrifuged \nas above.  The combined supernatants were then centrifuged at 11,000 xg for 20 min at 4\u00b0C.  The \nresulting pellet was re-homogenized in 40 volumes of 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM \nDTT, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 27,000 xg for 20 min at 4\u00b0C.  The resulting pellet \nwas re-suspended in the same buffer at a protein concentration of 1 mg mL-1, aliquots snap-\nfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C.  To minimize membrane degradation, assays were \nconducted within 24 h of membrane preparation. \n \n[35S]-GTP\u03b3S Binding\/Immunocapture Assay \n[35S]-GTP\u03b3S-G\u03b1q\/11 immuno-specific binding using a 96 well SPA-based method was performed \nusing the method described by Salah-Uddin et al. (2008).  Assays were performed blind to \nsubject diagnosis, and extracts from each cohort of matched subjects with schizophrenia and \ncontrol subjects were run together in the same set of experiments.  Membranes were pre-treated \nwith 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 60 min on ice and subsequently diluted in assay buffer \n(20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) at a final protein concentration of 25 \u03bcg \nper assay point. GDP (0.1 \u03bcM) was added at 55 min into the NEM-containing incubation \nmedium.  Experimental reactions were performed in a final volume of 100 \u03bcL in 96-well \nOptiplates\u2122.  To ensure equilibrium [35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding, 60 \u03bcL of membranes were added to \neach well containing agonist and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 20 min.  Nucleotide exchange was \ninitiated through the addition of 20 \u03bcL [35S]-GTP\u03b3S to each well to give a final concentration of \n500 pM and membranes were incubated for 60 min at 25\u00b0C.  Ice-cold 0.27% Igepal-CA630 was \nused to terminate the reaction. Rabbit anti-G\u03b1q\/11 antibody (1:300) was then added to each well \nand the plate agitated at 4\u00b0C for 60 min.  Finally, Anti-IgG-coated PVT-SPA beads were added to \neach well, the plate agitated once again for a further 30 min at 4\u00b0C after which it was centrifuged.  \nBound radioactivity was measured using a TopCount detector. \n \nData Analysis \nConcentration-response curves were fitted by non-linear regression analysis with variable slope \nusing GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, CA).  The residuals of all \n 9\nthe experimental responses were analyzed to identify the distribution.  G protein and [3H]-\npirenzepine were normally distributed and signal window (c.p.m.), Hill slope and pEC50 were log \nnormally distributed.  A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the G \nprotein, [3H]- pirenzepine, Hill slope and pEC50, and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was \nused to analyze binding-over-basal with age being fitted as the covariate. Planned comparisons \nusing Student's t test were then investigated and adjusted for multiplicity (using the Tukey\u2019s test) \nto identify if there were significant differences in the responses between the 3 diagnostic groups.  \n \nPearson product-moment correlations, assuming a straight-line best fit, were used to analyze \nrelationships between experimental parameters, and relationships between the continuous \nclinincal parameters and the experimental parameters. The clinical responses, age, PMI, brain \nweight and brain pH were analysed using one-way ANOVA, and planned comparisons using \nStudent's t test were then investigated and adjusted for multiplicity to identify if there were \nsignificant differences in the responses between the 3 diagnostic groups; DOI and last recorded \ndrug dose were analysed using Student\u2019s t test, and sex and suicide were analysed using Fisher\u2019s \nexact test.  Any significant differences observed in the experimental dataset were not attributable \nto demographics. \n \n  \n 10\nRESULTS \n \nDemographic Data \nDorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9) tissue was obtained from 14 male and 6 female subjects \nwith schizophrenia, and 8 male and 2 female control subjects.  There was no statistical difference \nin the mean ages and gender of the subjects with schizophrenia and control subjects (F (2, 27) = \n0.008, P = 0.992 and P = 0.153, respectively).  Likewise, there were no significant differences in \nCNS pH (F (2, 27) = 0.929, P = 0.407), brain weight (F (2, 20) = 2.083, P = 0.151), PMI (F (2, \n27) = 0.441, P = 0.648), duration of illness (F (1, 18) = 0.302, P = 0.589), or last recorded drug \ndoses (F (1,18) = 0.493, P = 0.492).  An increased suicide rate was observed in the combined \npatient group of subjects with schizophrenia, but was not significantly different between the sub-\ngroups of subjects with schizophrenia (P = 0.076). \n \n[3H]-Pirenzepine Binding \n[3H]-PZP binding was significantly decreased in tissue sections prepared from BA9 from subjects \nwith schizophrenia compared to control brains (105 \u00b1 17 versus 183 \u00b1 12 fmol mg-1 ETE; (F (2, \n27) = 53.618, P < 0.0001).  Subjects with schizophrenia were divided into two sub-groups based \non [3H]-PZP binding: \u201clow\u201d [3H]-PZP (MRDS; <100 fmol mg-1 ETE) and \u201cnormal\u201d [3H]-PZP \n(non-MRDS; >100 fmol mg-1 ETE) binding groups; [3H]-PZP binding in these sub-groups was \n38 \u00b1 9 and 174 \u00b1 12 fmol mg-1 ETE, respectively (Figure 1).  [3H]-PZP binding in the MRDS \ngroup was significantly different from both the control and non-MRDS groups (P < 0.001), while \nthere was no difference between the control and non-MRDS groups (P = 0.806). \n \nWestern Blot Analysis \nImmunoblotting for G\u03b1q\/11 proteins in BA9 of all subjects revealed no differences between \ncontrols, MRDS or non-MRDS groups (F (2,27) = 0.164, P = 0.850).  The ratio of band intensity \ncompared to the internal control was 1.09 \u00b1 0.17 and 1.00 \u00b1 0.15 for the MRDS and non-MRDS \ngroups, respectively, and 0.98 \u00b1 0.06 for the control group.  No correlation was found between \nG\u03b1q\/11 immunoreactivity and [3H]-pirenzepine binding (P = 0.667). \n \n 11\n[35S]-GTP\u03b3S Binding\/Immunocapture Assay \nTo assess CHRM1 function in membranes prepared from BA9, agonist-stimulated G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-\nGTP\u03b3S immunospecific binding was assessed in controls, MRDS and non-MRDS groups.  The \nCHRM full agonist oxotremorine-M and the CHRM1-selective allosteric partial agonist, AC-42 \n(Spalding et al., 2002; Langmead et al., 2006), were used to stimulate receptors in all membrane \npreparations.  Representative concentration-dependent responses for oxotremorine-M- and AC-\n42-stimulated G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding in the different groups are shown in Figure 2.  The \npotency of oxotremorine-M differed between groups (F (2,27) = 4.234 , P = 0.025) and was \nsignificantly decreased in MRDS group (pEC50 (M), 5.69 \u00b1 0.16) compared to the control group \n(pEC50 = 6.17 \u00b1 0.10; P = 0.024).  No difference in potency was observed between control and \nthe non-MRDS group (pEC50 = 6.05 \u00b1 0.07; P = 0.091).  Scatter graphs of these data are shown \nin Figure 3.  Similar trends were also seen with respect to AC-42-stimulated G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S \nbinding in the different groups (pEC50 (M) values: control, 5.31 \u00b1 0.19; MRDS, 4.72 \u00b1 0.11; non-\nMRDS, 5.14 \u00b1 0.14; F (2, 27) = 2.222, P = 0.127) with a significantly decreased potency in the \nMRDS group (P = 0.024). \n \nNo differences were detected in basal levels of G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding between the groups \n(basal values (c.p.m. per 25 \u03bcg membrane protein): control, 2147 \u00b1 96; MRDS, 2138 \u00b1 93; non-\nMRDS, 2384 \u00b1 152; F (2,27) = 2.074, P = 0.145).  We therefore chose to analyze relative agonist \nefficacy by expressing agonist-stimulated increases in G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding as the \nmagnitude of the signal window generated in c.p.m. (Figure 4).  Maximal oxotremorine-M-\nstimulated G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding in BA9 membranes (measured as concentration-response \ncurve maxima \u2013 basal calculated by GraphPad Prism) was significantly greater in the MRDS \ngroup (signal window, 4703 \u00b1 296 c.p.m.) compared to the controls (3240 \u00b1 190 c.p.m.; \nP=0.003).  In contrast, no significant difference was observed between the control and non-\nMRDS groups (P = 0.464).  Similar, but not statistically significantly different, trends were seen \nwith respect to AC-42 relative efficacy differences between the groups with respect to the \nincrease in G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding-over-basal (c.p.m): control, 1964 \u00b1 173; MRDS, 2664 \u00b1 \n228; non-MRDS, 2234 \u00b1 176; F (2, 27) = 2.183, P = 0.062).  The intrinsic activity of AC-42 \nrelative to oxotremorine-M ([maximal AC-42 response\/maximal oxotremorine-M response] x \n 12\n100) remained unchanged in all sub-groups (control, 53 \u00b1 3%; MRDS, 54 \u00b1 4%; non-MRDS, 50 \n\u00b1 3%). \n \nRepresentative concentration-response curves from the control sub-groups of subjects with \nschizophrenia are shown in Figure 5.  As well as illustrating the dextral-shift and increase in \nmaximal response observed for the MRDS group, it can also be seen that there are apparent \ndifferences in the slope factors (Hill coefficients) for the three curves (F (2, 27) = 14.835, P < \n0.001).  We therefore determined Hill coefficients for oxotremorine-M-stimulated G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-\nGTP\u03b3S binding responses (Figure 6) in the control and sub-groups subjects with schizophrenia. \nHill coefficients for oxotremorine-M concentration-response curves for the MRDS (nH = 0.82 \u00b1 \n0.02) were significantly greater than those determined for control (0.64 \u00b1 0.01; P < 0.001) and \nnon-MRDS (0.68 \u00b1 0.02; P = 0.0013) groups.  There was no significant difference between the \nlatter two groups. \n \nWhen potencies, relative efficacies and Hill coefficients for oxotremorine-M-stimulated receptor-\nG\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding were plotted against [3H]-pirenzepine binding values for all subjects, \nsignificant correlations were obtained for all parameters; pEC50 (P < 0.001, r2 = 0.325; Figure \n7A), maximal G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding-over-basal (P = 0.046, r2 = 0.134; Figure 7B) and Hill \ncoefficient (P < 0.001, r2 = 0.551; Figure 7C).  Although, the observed correlation between \nreceptor expression and pEC50 value was consistent with receptor theory (i.e. a decrease in pEC50 \nas receptor expression increases), the increasing maximal responsiveness with decreasing \nreceptor expression was not. \n \n  \n 13\nDISCUSSION \n \nIn this study we have shown that a sub-group of subjects with schizophrenia defined as MRDS \n(Scarr et al., 2008), display distinct functional changes with respect to the proximal downstream \nsignalling consequences of CHRM activation.  In particular, despite a marked reduction in \nCHRM1 expression (down by 75-80% compared to both a control group and a sub-group of \nsubjects with schizophrenia displaying normal [3H]-pirenzepine binding), agonist-stimulated \n[35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding to G\u03b1q\/11 proteins was increased in MRDS membranes prepared from \ndorsolateral cortex (BA9), relative to both the other non-MRDS and control groups.  \n \nChanges in CHRM expression in the brains of subjects with schizophrenia have been widely \nreported, with the majority of studies reporting subtype-specific deficits (Dean et al., 1996; 2002; \nCrook et al., 2000; 2001; Raedler et al., 2003).  Based on the criteria used recently to define a \nCHRM-deficit endophenotype (Scarr et al., 2008), we have performed a pharmacological \nanalysis of CHRM function in membranes prepared from BA9 of MRDS and non-MRDS \nsubjects, and control subjects.  We have utilized a G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding immunocapture \nassay (Salah-Uddin et al., 2008), which allows us to assess productive receptor-G protein \ncoupling in membrane preparations and hence report a proximal functional readout of relative \nefficacy, as well as expression level of CHRM, within human dorsolateral cortex for the different \nsubject groups.  In addition, we have previously shown in human cortical (BA23\/25) membranes \nthat the oxotremorine-M-mediated signal is wholly attributable to CHRM1 stimulation, as \nagonist-stimulated [35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding to G\u03b1q\/11 proteins is completely prevented by pre-\nincubation with the selective CHRM1 toxin, MT-7 (Salah-Uddin et al., 2008).  \n \nInitial experiments demonstrated that the full agonist oxotremorine-M and the CHRM1-selective \nallosteric partial agonist, AC-42 (Spalding et al., 2002; Langmead et al., 2006), each caused \nconcentration-dependent increases in G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding in control and both sub-groups \nsubjects with schizophrenia.  This is of particular relevance in the MRDS endophenotype as it \nmight have been predicted that CHRM1 function would be diminished due to the observed \ndecrease in receptor number, and that therapeutic strategies targeting the CHRM1 in this group \nmight not be effective.  However, although receptor number was decreased in the MRDS group, \nthe residual CHRM1 population coupled with greater efficiency to this key functional readout \n 14\nsuch that maximal responses were undiminished.  Data were generated using oxotremorine-M for \nthe comparison of potency, efficacy and receptor\/G protein cooperativity in healthy and diseased \ntissue.  This is because full agonist oxotremorine-M provides a larger signal window compared to \nthe partial agonist AC-42 that allows for subtle differences in pharmacology to be measured.  \nThis is very important when investigating pathological mechanisms.  Furthermore, the intrinsic \nactivity of AC-42 relative to oxotremorine-M was similar in all groups.  The selectivity and novel \nbinding site of AC-42 at the CHRM1 affords it, and similarly acting compounds, potential \ntherapeutic advantages (Langmead and Christopoulos, 2006) and therefore our observation is \nimportant in showing that AC-42 is effective in functionally activating the CHRM1 sub-type with \nsimilar relative efficacy in brain tissue from both normal donors and subjects with schizophrenia.  \nEffects of AC-42 followed similar trends to oxotremorine-M, but were less pronounced in subject \ngroups due to the smaller signal window. \n \nGiven the marked decrease in [3H]-pirenzepine binding sites it is not surprising that the potency \nof oxotremorine-M to stimulate G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding was reduced 2-3 fold in the MRDS \nsub-group compared to controls and the normal PZP schizophrenia sub-group.  Classical studies \nin which receptor expression levels are incrementally decreased by irreversible alkylation have \ndemonstrated that concentration-effect curves become increasingly right-shifted and then collapse \nonce all \u2018spare\u2019 receptors have been eliminated (see Kenakin, 2006).  \n \nIn contrast, the relative efficacy of oxotremorine-M was significantly greater in the MRDS sub-\ngroup compared to the control and non-MRDS groups, despite the marked decrease in [3H]-\npirenzepine binding observed in this sub-group.  This difference cannot be explained or predicted \nsimply by receptor number as efficacy is generally determined by multiple components in the \nsignal transduction system measured.  An alternative way of showing this between sub-groups \nefficacy difference is presented in Figure 8.  Here we have calculated the increase in [35S]-GTP\u03b3S \nbound to G\u03b1q\/11 proteins (as fmol mg-1 membrane protein) stimulated by a maximally-effective \noxotremorine-M concentration and compared this to the receptor density (assuming that 15 nM \n[3H]-pirenzepine provides an estimate of the receptor density in each BA9 membrane \npreparation).  In membranes prepared from control and non-MRDS groups this yields a \nstoichiometry of <1, however, for the MRDS sub-group this value rises to ~4, representing an 8-\n10 fold change in the CHRM1-to-G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S stoichiometry in this schizophrenia \n 15\nendophenotype, and suggesting a fundamentally altered receptor-G protein coupling in this \ngroup.  Given that the intrinsic activity of AC-42 does not vary between sub-groups we can \nconclude that a comparable stoichiometry change also occurs for this allosteric partial agonist in \nMRDS.  \n \nAnother potentially important observation made in this study is that the slope factor (Hill \ncoefficient) of the concentration-response curves for oxotremorine-M-stimulated G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-\nGTP\u03b3S binding varies between groups.  The Hill coefficient can be used to indicate cooperativity \nbetween receptor and G protein and in turn, be used as a measure of receptor-G protein coupling \nefficiency.  Hill coefficients of less than one were consistently observed in all subject groups, \nhowever significantly greater values were observed in the MRDS group.  There are a number of \npossible explanations why Hill coefficients within this range are observed with respect to \nreceptor-G protein coupling.  These include the possibility of receptor populations existing in \ndifferent affinity states for the agonist (e.g. \u201cfree\u201d receptors versus pre-coupled receptor-G \nprotein ternary complexes (De Lean et al., 1980)), and\/or the compartmentalization of receptors \nand\/or G proteins constraining productive coupling.  Irrespective of the precise explanation, the \nobserved increase in Hill coefficient for oxotremorine-M-stimulated G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding \nconcentration-response curves in the MRDS group may be a further indication of an adaptation to \ndecreased CHRM1 number in cortical neuronal populations of subjects with schizophrenia \ncategorized within the MRDS endophenotype.  This suggests an enhanced CHRM1\/G\u03b1q\/11 \ncoupling and supports the altered stoichiometry of receptor-facilitated G\u03b1q\/11-[35S]-GTP\u03b3S \nbinding observed in this sub-group (Figure 8). \n \nThe stoichiometry of productive receptor-G protein coupling is likely to be influenced by a \nvariety of factors.  Here we have shown that levels of G\u03b1q\/11 protein expression within BA9 are \nnot altered in schizophrenia.  A previous study, which undertook quantitative analysis of G\u03b1q\/11 \nprotein expression in human cerebral cortex, indicated that this G protein subtype is expressed at \na level of 20-30 pmol mg-1 protein (L\u00f3pez de Jes\u00fas et al., 2006).  This indicates that G\u03b1q\/11 \nproteins are likely to be expressed in considerable (>10 fold) excess compared to the CHRM1 in \nthe membrane preparations used here, and thus G\u03b1q\/11 protein availability for productive coupling \nto agonist-occupied CHRM1 is unlikely to be rate-limiting.  Therefore, it may be possible for \n 16\neach activated CHRM1 to recruit multiple Gq\/11 proteins and in the MRDS endophenotype the \ndata would suggest that an increased receptor\/G protein ratio may manifest itself as a greater \ncooperativity between receptor and G protein (higher Hill coefficient) along with increased [35S]-\nGTP\u03b3S binding per CHRM1. \n \nIrrespective of what underlies the relative efficacy difference, we have clearly shown using a \nG\u03b1q\/11 protein-specific [35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding assay that while a sub-population of subjects with \nschizophrenia show a marked decrease in dorsolateral prefrontal cortical CHRM1 this is (super-) \ncompensated for by an adaptative change in receptor-G protein coupling efficiency.  Whether this \nadaptation represents a manifestation of the underlying disease process, or is a secondary process \nmitigating (or militating) the decline in CHRM1 expression remains to be determined.  The \nCHRM1 subtype is predominant among CHRMs in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus \n(Weiner et al., 1990; Levey et al., 1991), where it is expressed on the majority of neuronal post-\nsynaptic nerve terminals (Hersch and Levey, 1995).  The CHRM1 subtype has been shown to be \ninvolved in cognitive processes, most recently through the use of knockout mice (Hamilton et al., \n1997; Anagnostaras et al., 2003; Wess et al., 2007).  An array of clinical and basic science \nevidence has implicated dysfunctional prefrontal cortical circuitry in the pathophysiology of \nschizophrenia (Perlstein et al., 2001; Ragland et al., 2007), with cholinergic deficits being \nspecifically implicated (Hyde and Crook, 2001).  To date, it has not been possible to separate the \nMRDS endophenotype from other subjects with schizophrenia by CHRM1 sequence, gender, \nage, suicide, duration of illness or any particular drug treatment (Scarr et al., 2008).  However, \nour observation of altered CHRM1 number and efficacy (assessed as receptor-stimulated [35S]-\nGTP\u03b3S-for-GDP exchange on G\u03b1q\/11 proteins) provides new insight into how the prefrontal \ncortical cholinergic circuitry may change and adapt in different endophenotypes of subjects with \nschizophrenia.  Interestingly, very recent data from a small clinical trial of patients with \nschizophrenia (Shekhar et al., 2008) demonstrated that the CHRM agonist xanomeline, which \nshows some degree of selectivity for CHRM1, separated from placebo for verbal learning and \nshort term memory indices.  These data suggest that this therapeutic intervention may be effective \nin the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and it will be important to establish the \nrelative effectiveness of CHRM1 agonists in the MRDS and non-MRDS sub-groups of subjects \nwith schizophrenia. \n  \n 17\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nWe gratefully acknowledge Drs.
