The results \nof this study demonstrate the enhanced capability of data integration for detailed lithological \nmapping in areas where spectral discrimination is complicated by the presence of vegetation or \ninherent spectral similarities. \n  \n1. Introduction \nOver large areas and where the terrain is geologically complex or poorly accessible, field-\nbased lithological mapping can be time-consuming, costly and challenging (Gad & Kusky, 2007; \nGrunsky et al., 2009; Rogge et al., 2009). For these reasons lithological maps are typically \ngenerated using limited numbers of field and outcrop observations which may, as a consequence, \nresult in some concern regarding the accuracy of the lithological contacts (Philip et al., 2003). \nRemote sensing data, such as aerial photographs and multi- and hyperspectral imagery, offers \nsolutions to many of the restrictions associated with field-based surveys. For instance, remotely \nsensed data can provide more continuous and detailed information for large areas, thus enabling \neven the most inaccessible terrain to be mapped for only a fraction of the time and cost required \nfor an equivalent field survey. \nThe application of multi- and hyperspectral imagery to lithological mapping is well \nestablished for arid and semi-arid areas which are essentially devoid of vegetation. Due to the \ngood exposure of rocks and soils, lithology can be mapped directly by matching image pixel \nspectra with the reference reflectance spectra of individual rock units using automated \nclassification routines (e.g., Rowan & Mars, 2003; Harris et al., 2005; Roy et al., 2009). \nHowever, spectral discrimination and mapping in all but the most barren terrain can be \nproblematic, because just small amounts (\u2265 10%) of vegetation cover (e.g., trees, shrubs and \nlichen) can obscure or completely mask the spectra of underlying lithologies (Siegal & Goetz, \n1977; Ager & Milton, 1987; Murphy & Wadge, 1994).  \nWhere the effects of vegetation prevail, image processing techniques such as principal \ncomponent analysis (Fraser & Green, 1987; Loughlin, 1991) and spectral unmixing (Bierwirth, \n1990; Chabrillat et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2005) have been employed to try and separate the \nspectral responses of vegetation and substrate, and to detect rock exposures at sub-pixel \nresolutions. Alternatively, indirect lithological discrimination is possible if geobotanical \nrelationships with the underlying substrates are realised (Paradella et al., 1997; Leverington, \n2010). For example, Rowan et al. (2004) utilised subtle spectral features relating to variations in \nvegetation cover to map specific lithological units in the Mordor Complex, Australia, while \nHarris et al. (2005) used a vegetation spectral end-member as a proxy for mapping metagabbroic \nrocks in southern Baffin Island, Canada. However, if lithology and vegetation are unrelated, or if \ndistinct lithologies exhibit an inherent spectral similarity regardless of vegetation cover, spectral \ndata alone are often insufficient for successful discrimination (Schetselaar et al., 2000; Dong & \nLeblon, 2004). In such circumstances it may be beneficial to consider ancillary information for \nthe differentiation and mapping of lithological units. \nNumerous studies have assessed the ability to augment the lithological mapping results of \nspectral-only classifications by incorporating ancillary data such as topographic information \n(Hutchinson, 1982; Ricchetti, 2000), spectral-derived texture (Chica-Olmo & Abarca-Hern\u00e1ndez, \n2000; Li et al., 2001) and radar-derived texture (Mather et al., 1998; Dong & Leblon, 2004). \nThese data are potentially useful because they provide information about the surface \nmorphology, which is often found to be correlated with lithology through differences in the \nweathering and erosion characteristics of individual units (Mather et al., 1998; K\u00fchni & Pfiffner, \n2001; Belt & Paxton, 2005). Although previous studies have demonstrated the capability to \nimprove lithological classification accuracies through data integration, they have been confined \nto using data with only moderate-to-coarse spatial resolutions (i.e., 12.5\u201330 m). The potential to \ndelineate lithological contacts in finer detail and with better accuracy is further enhanced by the \navailability of high-resolution remote sensing data (Philip et al., 2003).  \nAircraft-mounted sensors provide remotely sensed data with a spatial resolution of up to \nan order of magnitude greater than the classic spaceborne sensors such as Landsat TM and \nASTER. Furthermore, airborne surveys are commonly exploited for the concomitant acquisition \nof multisource data; in particular both multi- or hyperspectral imagery and Light Detection And \nRanging (LiDAR) data. In contrast to passive spectral sensors, airborne LiDAR is an active \nremote sensing technique that has the capability of acquiring accurate and high-resolution (ca. 1\u2013\n4 m) topographic data, even through forest cover (Kraus & Pfeifer, 1998). It offers a solution for \novercoming the obscuring effects that dense vegetation has on lithological discrimination \nbecause laser reflections (or returns) from the ground can be separated from vegetation returns to \nvirtually deforest the terrain, enabling the generation of digital terrain models (DTMs; Haugerud \n& Harding, 2001). The resulting high-resolution DTMs can then be used both qualitatively \n(Webster et al., 2006a,b) and quantitatively (Wallace, 2005; Wallace et al., 2006; Grebby et al., \n2010) to reveal subtle topographic differences that reflect changes in lithology. Topographic data \nfrom sources other than airborne LiDAR can lack the spatial resolution required for delineating \nsubtle contacts between lithological units (Webster et al., 2006a). Accordingly, the integration of \nairborne LiDAR topographic data with airborne multi- or hyperspectral imagery may provide a \nsignificant improvement of the classification results, especially in cases where there are no \ngeobotanical relationships. However, the true efficacy of this approach has not yet been \ndemonstrated.   \nThis study concerns the detailed lithological mapping of a vegetated section of the \nTroodos ophiolite, Cyprus. In a previous study for the same area, Grebby et al. (2010) \ndemonstrated the ability to discriminate and map the main lithological units to a respectable \naccuracy solely using LiDAR-derived topographic information. Despite this, natural and \nanthropogenically induced deviations from the typical topographic characteristics were the cause \nof some classification confusion between specific units. In an effort to identify a more optimal \napproach, the aims of the current study are to: (i) assess the efficacy of airborne multispectral \nimagery for detailed lithological mapping and (ii) utilise the results of the previous study to \ninvestigate whether the integration of airborne LiDAR-derived topographic data can further \nenhance the mapping capabilities. For both aims, a number of different algorithms were \ninvestigated in an attempt to maximise the mapping accuracy. The mapping results of the \nalgorithms were first assessed individually using conventional classification accuracy statistics, \nbefore pair-wise comparisons were made in order to establish the algorithm capable of \ngenerating the most accurate lithological map. \n \n2. Study area \nThe study area is located in the foothills on the northern flank of the Troodos ophiolite, \nCyprus (Fig. 1). The Troodos ophiolite is an uplifted slice of oceanic crust and lithospheric \nmantle that was created through sea-floor spreading (Gass, 1968; Moores & Vine, 1971). \nExhibiting a dome-like structure centred on Mt. Olympus (1,952 m), the ophiolite stratigraphy \nincludes a mantle sequence comprising harzburgites, dunites and a serpentinite diapir exposed at \nthe highest elevations. This mantle sequence is stratigraphically overlain by a largely gabbroic \nplutonic complex, a sheeted dyke complex, extrusive lavas and oceanic sediments at decreasing \nelevations along the northern slope of the range (Varga & Moores, 1985).   \nThe study area covers approximately 16 km\n2 \nof the upper section of the ophiolite, and \ncomprises four main lithological units \u2014 the Basal Group lavas and dykes, pillow lavas (Upper \nand Lower), Lefkara Formation chalky marls and alluvium\u2013colluvium. Two published geological \nmaps of the island cover this area at both regional and local mapping scales (see Fig. 1). The \n1:31,680-scale map is the product of a mapping campaign undertaken in the late 1950\u2019s and early \n1960\u2019s, whereas the 1:250,000-scale map is the more recent version, revised in 1995. Regardless \nof scale, the two maps exhibit some obvious geological differences. This can be ultimately \nattributed to the limited area covered during fieldwork, the subjectivity of the employed mapping \ntechniques and some degree of ambiguity in defining a number of the lithological units.  \nStratigraphically, the Basal Group is the lowest unit in the study area. Consisting of both \ndykes and screens of pillow lavas, this unit represents a transition from the underlying sheeted \ndyke complex (100% dykes) to the overlying pillow lavas. An exact definition of the Basal \nGroup is somewhat lacking, although it generally contains at least 50% dykes but with a more \ncommon dyke abundance of 80\u201390% (Bear, 1960). The pillow lavas have traditionally been \ndivided into the Upper Pillow Lavas and the Lower Pillow Lavas according to mineralogy, \ncolour and dyke abundance (Wilson 1959; Gass, 1960). However, this division is difficult to \napply in the field (Govett & Pantazis, 1971) and an unconformable or transitional boundary \nbetween the two lava units has led to some uncertainty about this division (Boyle & Robertson, \n1984). For this reason, the pillow lavas are treated as a single unit in the current study. The \npillow lavas are stratigraphically overlain by the chalks, marls and cherts of the Lefkara \nFormation. This unit represents late Cretaceous to early Miocene marine sedimentation (K\u00e4hler \n& Stow, 1998). The alluvium\u2013colluvium unit refers to Quaternary sediments, such as sand, silts, \nsoils and gravels, that were deposited fluvially or through hill-slope processes. The alluvium\u2013\ncolluvium is commonly found filling depressions within the hummocky pillow lava terrain. \nThe study area contains a complex landscape due to the variable geology, both natural \nand anthropogenic influences on the topography, and vegetation cover. Prominent anthropogenic \nfeatures include the disused Mathiati mine with spoil tips, Agia Varvara Lefkosias village (see \nFig. 1) and a significant proportion of agricultural land which is confined to areas underlain by \nalluvial\u2013colluvial materials. Vegetation is widespread throughout, covering between 30\u201390% of \nthe surface area, therefore resulting in a heterogeneous surface mixture of vegetation and \nrock\/soil (Fig. 2a). Correlation between some species of vegetation and particular lithological \nunits is also apparent within this area. For example, green grasses plus a variety of crops \n(including olive groves) are predominantly associated with alluvium\u2013colluvium (Fig. 2b), \nwhereas in addition to some low scrubby vegetation, moderate-to-dense lichen cover is almost \nexclusively found growing on pillow lava outcrops (Fig. 2c). Conversely, some similarities in the \ntypes of low and medium-growth vegetation commonly found growing on the Lefkara Formation \nand Basal Group terrain are also apparent. Other types of mostly sporadic vegetation cover \noccurring throughout the study area include trees \u2014 ranging from isolated trees (e.g., pines and \noaks) to dense thickets and copses \u2014 and areas covered by tall, dry grasses and other scrubland.  \n \n3. Data and pre-processing \n3.1 Airborne multispectral imagery \nAirborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) multispectral imagery was acquired by the Natural \nEnvironment Research Council (NERC) Airborne Research and Survey Facility (ARSF) in May, \n2005. The ATM imagery comprises 11 spectral bands in the visible\/near-infrared (VNIR; Bands \n1\u20138), short-wave infrared (SWIR; Bands 9\u201310) and thermal infrared (TIR; Band 11). Since this \nstudy is concerned with only reflectance data, the TIR band (Band 11) was discarded. Band 1 \nwas also omitted as the data are significantly affected by atmospheric scattering (Copley & \nMoore, 1993). Five northwest-southeast trending flight-lines of imagery were acquired over the \nstudy area and delivered as Level 1b Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) files, with radiometric \ncalibration algorithms applied and aircraft navigation information appended. Radiometric \ncalibration involved conversion of the raw ATM data to at-sensor radiance units and then \nsubsequent scaling to 16-bit digital numbers (DNs). All image strips were individually \ngeocorrected and re-sampled to a spatial resolution of 4 m using the AZGCORR software \n(Azimuth Systems) in conjunction with a 4 m LiDAR digital elevation model.  \nAcross-track (i.e., perpendicular to the flight direction) brightness differences observed in \nall geocorrected images were minimised through a multiplicative second-order polynomial \ncorrection, which was applied using the Cross-track Illumination Correction tool in ENVI 4.3 \n(ITT Visual Information Solutions, 2006.). Following this correction, image strips were co-\nregistered with the aid of tie-points identified in pairs of overlapping images, and then mosaicked \nto create a single seamless image; both tasks were performed within ENVI 4.3. Colour Balancing \nwas applied during mosaicking to minimise the spectral differences between overlapping images. \nThis procedure calculates gains and offsets from a fixed image and then uses these to adjust the \nspectral values of an overlapping image, thus matching the spectral statistics between the images. \nDue to an absence of ground reflectance spectra and atmospheric measurements at the time of \nthe airborne survey, rigorous model or empirical-based atmospheric corrections could not be \nreliably applied. Moreover, an inspection of the spectral values in the pre-processed imagery \nsuggested that first-order atmospheric correction for effects such as haze was not necessary and, \nas a consequence, no atmospheric correction was applied to the ATM imagery. \n \n \n \n3.2 Airborne LiDAR data \nAt the same time as the ATM data acquisition an airborne LiDAR survey was also \nundertaken using an Optech ALTM-3033 system. It was undertaken at an average flying altitude \nof 2550 m above sea level, resulting in an aircraft\u2013ground distance ranging between 2100\u20132300 \nm due to topographic relief on the order of 200 m. The ALTM-3033 system was operated with a \nlaser pulse repetition rate of 33 kHz and half-scan angle of \u00b119.4\u00b0 either side of the nadir, \nresulting in the collection of approximately 7,600,000 points for the study area with an average \ndensity of 0.48 points per m\n2\n. The dataset contains point data from five overlapping flight-lines, \neach with a swath width of 1400\u20131500 m and an overlap of 20%\u201350% between adjacent swaths. \nFollowing pre-processing by the Unit for Landscape Modelling (ULM) at the University of \nCambridge, UK, the LiDAR point data were delivered as ASCII files containing the x-y-z \ncoordinates of all first and last returns in the WGS84 Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) \nzone 36-North coordinate system. Following delivery, the point data were classified as either \nground or non-ground returns using a triangulated irregular network (TIN) densification \nalgorithm (Axelsson, 2000). This algorithm, which is implemented in the TerraScan software \n(Terrasolid Ltd.), first establishes a set of low (ground) points and then iteratively classifies the \nremaining points as either ground or non-ground returns according to angle and distance \nthresholds applied to TIN facets. For further information regarding the classification process, \nsuch as the parameters and thresholds used and verification of the results, the reader is referred to \nGrebby et al. (2010). Following classification, non-ground returns were discarded, while those \nclassified as ground were then used to generate a DTM. As the choice of interpolation algorithm \nand spatial resolution can affect the accuracy of DTMs, an experiment was conducted in order to \ndetermine the most appropriate combination (Grebby et al., 2010). Consequently, a 4 m DTM \nwas generated in Surfer 8.0 (Golden Software, Inc.) using a block kriging algorithm, since this \ncombination resulted in the smallest interpolation errors. As a final step, the ATM imagery was \nsubsequently co-registered to the 4 m DTM in ENVI 4.3, using an RST method with image-\nselected tie-points and cubic convolution resampling.    \n \n4. Methods \n The methodology employed here to assess the efficacy of ATM imagery for detailed \nlithological mapping in vegetated terrain, and to evaluate whether improvements can be made \nthrough the integration of LiDAR-derived topographic data, is outlined in Fig. 3. In summary, \nthe mapping methodology consists of four main steps: 1) the selection of training and validation \npixels, 2) derivation of the input variables, 3) classification, and 4) an accuracy assessment.  \n \n4.1 Training and validation pixels \n Two independent samples of pixels with known class identities were identified for \ntraining and validating the algorithms. The set of training pixels was used to assist all \nclassifications of the full scene by helping to spectrally and topographically characterise the four \nlithological units. This set comprised pixels located within four representative areas (i.e., regions \nof interest; ROIs) with unambiguous class identities, which were carefully defined in the imagery \nusing information gathered from detailed field surveys and 0.7 m QuickBird satellite imagery. \nDue to the inconsistencies between the existing geological maps, their use was limited at this \nstage to providing only a general lithological overview of the study area. The number of training \npixels representing each unit was deliberately kept to a minimum to investigate how the \nalgorithms perform using only minimal a priori information about the spatial distribution of the \nlithologies. In total, the training dataset comprises less than 1% of the total number of pixels \nwithin the study area (Table 1). \nThe accuracy of a thematic map is customarily determined by comparing the true class \nidentities of a sample of validation pixels to those assigned through classification. In order to \nobtain a statistically valid accuracy estimate for an entire mapped area from only a sample of \nvalidation pixels, an appropriate sample size is required (Foody, 2009). The required sample size \ncan be determined using statistical sampling theory such as the normal approximation of the \nbinomial distribution (Fitzpatrick-Lins, 1981): \n \n2\n2Z\nE\npq\nn , (1) \nwhere n is the sample size, Z is the critical value of the normal distribution for the two-tailed \nsignificance level, p is the expected accuracy, q = 100\u2013p, and E is the allowable error (or level of \nprecision). If the value of p is unknown, then a \u2015worst case\u2016 (large) estimate of n can be found \nby maximising the term pq using p = 0.5. \nAlthough the sample size determined using the above method is suitable for estimating \nthe overall accuracy of a thematic map \u2014 where pixels are either correctly or incorrectly \nclassified \u2014 it does not account for the confusion that may occur between multiple classes \n(Congalton, 1991). To ensure that each class is adequately represented in a confusion matrix, \nCongalton (1991) suggests using a minimum of 50 to 100 validation pixels per class. \nAlternatively, the minimum number of samples for each class can be determined from the \nmultinomial distribution (Tortora, 1978; Congalton & Green, 1999). For a specified confidence \nlevel (\u03b1) and absolute precision (bi), the required number of samples, ni,, for class i can be \ncalculated as:   \n \n2\ni )1(\ni\ni\ni\nb\nB\nn , (2) \nwhere i  is the proportion of the scene covered by class i, B is the upper (\u03b1\/k) \u00d7 100\nth\n percentile \nof the \u03c72 distribution with one degree of freedom, and k is the number of exhaustive and mutually \nexclusive classes. A total of k calculations are needed to determine the sample sizes for all \nclasses, with the largest n typically chosen as the required sample size for all individual classes. \nAgain, if i  is unknown, then a large estimate of ni can be found by assuming i  = 0.5.  \n To achieve statistically valid estimates of both the overall accuracy and individual class \naccuracies for the whole map, the validation sample must satisfy both the total and individual \nclass size criteria. Therefore, in order to derive estimates of the overall accuracy of a map to say \na precision (E) of \u00b11% and the individual class accuracies to a precision (bi) of \u00b13% at the 95% \nconfidence level (\u03b1 = 0.05; also assuming p = i = 0.5), a validation sample of at least 9,604 \npixels is required, with a minimum of 1,734 pixels in each class. To achieve this, several ROIs \nwith unambiguous class identities were defined throughout the imagery to represent each \nlithological class \u2014 again with the aid of field knowledge and QuickBird imagery. Validation \npixels were then sampled from these ROIs using a random stratified sampling protocol to ensure \nclasses were represented proportionally, and to help reduce bias caused by spatial autocorrelation \n(Chini et al., 2008; Pacifici et al., 2009). Consequently, a total of 12,946 validation pixels were \nsampled, with a minimum class size of 2,451 pixels. Details regarding the areal extent and the \nnumber of pixels selected to represent each lithological class during validation can also be found \nin Table 1. \n \n \n4.2 Derivation of variables \n4.2.1 Spectral variables \n The efficacy of ATM imagery for lithological mapping in the vegetated Troodos study \narea was assessed by deriving three sets of spectral variables for use as inputs for classification. \nThe first set of input variables (ATM 9) comprised the nine ATM Bands 2\u201310. However, an \nexamination of the spectral signatures for the lithologies reveals low separability for some units \n(Fig. 4). A combination of inherent or vegetation-induced spectral similarities and the \nconsiderable intra-class variability due to heterogeneous vegetation cover are ultimately \nresponsible for this lack of distinction. \nIn order to try and improve lithological discrimination, two image enhancement \ntechniques were employed: principal component analysis (PCA) and the Minimum Noise \nFraction (MNF) transformation. Variables derived from the application of PCA and the MNF \ntransformation are frequently used as inputs to classifiers to try to enhance the spectral \nseparability of classes present within the original imagery (Li & Moon, 2004; Belluco et al., \n2006; Liberti et al., 2009). A second set of spectral variables was therefore derived through the \napplication of PCA to the nine ATM bands. The PCA technique can enhance spectral \ninformation by decorrelating the data, segregating noise and reducing the data dimensionality \n(Jensen, 2005). The outcome of PCA is a new set of uncorrelated variables called Principal \nComponents (PCs), which are linear combinations of the original nine ATM bands. These PCs \nare ordered decreasingly in terms of the proportion of the total data variance they contain, with \nthe higher-order PCs containing most of the total variance. The small proportion of the total \nvariance contained within the lower-order PCs is mostly regarded as the noise within the original \nATM bands, and so discarding these PCs effectively segregates this noise. Following the PCA \ntransformation, examination of the eigenvalues revealed that the first three PCs accounted for \n97.5% of the total image variance (Table 2), while the remaining six PCs were deemed to contain \nmostly noise. Consequently, in an attempt to enhance lithological discrimination, only the first \nthree PCs were selected to form the second set of inputs variables for classification (ATM PC). \nEigenvector loadings in Table 2 show that the first PC (PC1) receives equal positive \ncontributions from all nine ATM bands and therefore represents albedo information. The high \npositive eigenvector loadings for ATM Bands 7 and 8 indicate that PC2 describes the presence of \nvegetation, which is highly reflective in the near-infrared (0.76\u20131.05 \u03bcm). The third PC primarily \ndescribes the contrast between the VNIR and SWIR regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. \nSpectral enhancement and data compression was also performed using the Minimum \nNoise Fraction (MNF) transformation (Green et al., 1988). The MNF transformation determines \nthe inherent dimensionality of the data and segregates noise using two PCA transformations \n(Boardman & Kruse, 1994). The first transformation \u2014 based on an estimated noise covariance \nmatrix \u2014 decorrelates and rescales the data noise, while the second step comprises a PCA \ntransformation of the noise-whitened data. As a result, the MNF transformation produces a set of \ncoherent eigenimages (MNF bands) with correspondingly large eigenvalues (i.e., signal-to-noise \nratios), and an accompanying set of noise-dominated images characterised by small eigenvalues. \nAccordingly, image noise can be segregated by selecting only the coherent MNF Bands. The \nMNF transformation implemented in ENVI 4.3 was applied to ATM Bands 2\u201310. An estimate of \nthe noise statistics was generated from a lithologically homogeneous area of alluvium\u2013colluvium \nthat was overlain with variable vegetation cover. As the spectral response of the underlying \nlithological substrate was considered to be constant in this area, it was expected that the noise \nwould primarily relate to the spectral variability caused by the heterogeneous rock\/vegetation \nsurface mixture. Although the noise estimate considers only one lithological unit, an MNF \ntransformation based on these statistics was still anticipated to produce an overall reduction in \nvegetation-related spectral variability throughout, and a consequential increase in lithological \ndiscrimination. Of the resulting nine MNF bands, the first four accounted for approximately 99% \nof the cumulative eigenvalues for the data (Table 3). These four MNF bands were subsequently \nselected to comprise the third set of spectral variables (ATM MNF), while the remaining five \nnoise-dominated MNF bands were discarded. According to the eigenvector loadings shown in \nTable 3, the four selected MNF bands receive their highest loadings from the ATM bands \nsituated in the visible part of the spectrum (i.e., Bands 2\u20135). In addition, the relatively minor \ncontributions of ATM Bands 7 and 8 to all four MNF bands are noteworthy.   \n \n4.2.2 Integrated spectral and topographic variables \n As the occurrence of vegetation is likely to affect the spectral discrimination and \nmapping of lithologies, ancillary topographic information was also considered. Within the \nTroodos study area, a correlation between topography and the four lithological units is clearly \nevident in the field. Grebby et al. (2010) showed it was possible to exploit this relationship to \ndiscriminate and map these lithologies solely using topographic information derived from a 4 m \nLiDAR DTM. Derived at their appropriate scales, the five morphometric variables of slope, \nabsolute profile curvature, absolute plan curvature, residual roughness and the hypsometric \nintegral were found to be optimal for separating the topographic characteristics of the four \nlithological units.  \nIn an attempt to improve the mapping results of the spectral-only classifications, these \nfive morphometric variables were integrated with the ATM spectral imagery through two \ndifferent approaches. The simplest approach to integrating ancillary data is to increase the \nnumber of variables used as inputs to the classification \u2014 a technique known as the \u2015logical \nchannel\u2016 approach (Strahler et al., 1978). Accordingly, the five morphometric variables were \nmerged with the nine ATM bands to form a first integrated set of fourteen input variables (ATM-\nLi). Multisource data can also be integrated using both PCA and the MNF transformation. A \ncomparison of the two approaches by Mutlu et al. (2008) robustly demonstrates the superior \nclassification results that are achievable using the MNF approach to multisource integration. \nTherefore, in order to try and enhance the spectral-topographic discrimination of lithologies \nwhile simultaneously reducing data redundancy, the MNF transformation was applied to the \nmerged set of fourteen spectral and morphometric variables. As a result, the first five MNF \nbands accounted for approximately 98% of the cumulative eigenvalues (Table 4) and were \nsubsequently selected to form the second set of integrated variables for classification (ATM-Li \nMNF). The first of these five integrated MNF bands (MNF1) receives its highest loading from \nATM Band 2, with sizeable contributions also from ATM Band 5, and the absolute profile \ncurvature and residual roughness variables. Both absolute profile curvature and ATM Band 5 \ncontribute the most information to the second MNF band, while also contributing significantly, \nalong with residual roughness, to MNF3. The fourth MNF band largely describes the contrast \nbetween absolute plan curvature and the hypsometric integral, whereas MNF5 receives high \npositive loadings from both of these morphometric variables. \n \n4.3 Classification \n The three sets of spectral variables and two sets of integrated spectral-topographic \nvariables derived above were used in conjunction with classification routines to generate \nlithological maps. With the aid of the training pixels, supervised classification was performed \nusing two classifiers with contrasting properties; the statistical Maximum Likelihood Classifier \n(MLC) and a non-parametric artificial neural network, called the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map \n(SOM; Kohonen, 1982, 2001).   \n The MLC is a popular image classifier that assumes the class probability density \nfunctions are multivariate normal (Mather et al., 1998). Individual class probability density \nfunctions are first computed using the mean vectors and covariance matrices of the classes, \nwhich are antecedently determined from the training pixels. Using this information, the \nprobabilities of an image pixel belonging to each of the classes is estimated and the pixel is \naccordingly assigned to the class for which the probability is highest. Where prior knowledge of \nthe study area is available, the MLC classification can also be refined using prior probabilities \n(Mather et al., 1998). However, since it was the intention to restrict the a priori knowledge to \nonly a small number of training pixels in this study, the MLC was used with equal prior \nprobabilities for each lithological class. \nIn many cases, the utility of statistical classifiers, such as the MLC, are often \ncompromised by the prevalence of complex lithological class probability density functions, \nwhich arise due to spatial variability in vegetation cover (Leverington, 2010). Furthermore, the \nsimple multivariate normal assumption regarding class probability density functions is also often \ninvalid for ancillary data (Hutchinson, 1982). Following this, it is apparent that artificial neural \nnetworks (NNs) are better suited to lithological classification because they are non-parametric, \nrobust in handling noisy data and can learn complex input patterns (Ji, 2000). These advantages \nover conventional classifiers are responsible for the increasing interest in NNs, the most popular \nof which is the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Alternative NNs, particularly the SOM, have not \nbeen investigated as thoroughly as the MLP. Nevertheless, the SOM is becoming increasingly \npopular as a classifier, by demonstrating its ability to achieve promising results for many remote \nsensing applications, including land-use classification (Ji, 2000; Bagan et al., 2005; Jianwen & \nBagan, 2005), and lithological mapping (Mather et al., 1998; Bedini, 2009). Considering this, all \ninput variables were additionally classified using the SOM algorithm implemented in IDRISI \nAndes (Li & Eastman, 2006), which is summarised below. \nA SOM network consists of two layers; an input layer containing one neuron for each of \nthe input variables, and an output layer made up of a two-dimensional array of neurons. Neurons \nin the output layer are connected to those in the input layer via synaptic weights. Random \nsynaptic weights, ranging 0\u20131, are initially assigned and these are then adjusted during learning \nto best describe patterns in the input data (Mather et al., 1998). Network learning is an iterative \nprocess and involves two stages: unsupervised coarse tuning and supervised fine tuning. During \ncoarse tuning, normalised input vectors (i.e., pixels in spectral or combined spectral-\nmorphometric space) are presented to the network to determine the output neuron with the best-\nmatching weight vector. The weight vectors of this best-matching neuron and output neurons \nwithin a given neighbourhood of the winner are subsequently adjusted in the direction of the \ninput vector according to the learning rate. Both the radius of the neighbourhood and the learning \nrate decrease with each iteration. Prior to fine tuning, input vectors with known class identities \n(i.e., training pixels) are used to preliminarily label the output neurons through a process known \nas majority voting. Fine tuning with the type-one Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ1) \nalgorithm (Kohonen, 1990) was then used to define the class boundaries in the output layer more \nprecisely. To do this, training pixels are again presented to the SOM and the weight vector of the \nbest-matching neuron is adjusted in the direction of the training vector if its label matches the \nclass identity of the pixel, but moved away if not. Once trained, output neurons are re-labelled \nand then all image pixels are presented to the network and assigned the class identity of their \nbest-matching output neuron. \n For classification using the SOM, parameters such as the number of output neurons, \ninitial neighbourhood radius and minimum and maximum learning rates must be defined. Using \nthe existing literature as a guide (e.g., Ji, 2000; Jianwen & Bagan, 2005; Bedini, 2009), \nnumerous tests were conducted to determine appropriate sets of parameters for all SOM \nclassifications. In each case, the appropriate parameters were chosen to try and minimise the \naverage quantisation error (average of Euclidean distances between input vectors and best-\nmatching neurons) and maximise the labelling accuracy of training pixels. The chosen \nparameters for each classification are shown in Table 5. In all cases, coarse tuning was \nperformed using all available input vectors (i.e., all 1,008,596 pixels), with a maximum learning \nrate of 0.05 and a minimum learning rate of 0.01. Fine tuning was performed with LVQ1 using a \nmaximum gain term of 0.005 and a minimum of 0.001. \n After classification using both the MLC and SOM, a 3 \u00d7 3 pixel majority filter was \napplied to every map. The purpose of the majority filter was to remove pixels that are isolated in \nterms of their lithological class because, as lithological units tend to form homogeneous areas, it \nis somewhat unlikely that the relatively small areal extent represented by these isolated pixels \ntruly represents a different lithological unit in an otherwise homogeneous area (Ricchetti, 2000). \n \n4.4 Accuracy assessment \nFor each set of input variables, the classification accuracy for the entire mapped area was \nassessed using the overall (OA), user\u2019s (UA) and producer\u2019s (PA) accuracies and the Kappa \ncoefficient (K) derived from a confusion matrix (Congalton, 1991). The OA is the percentage of \nall validation pixels correctly classified, whereas the UA and PA provide information regarding \nthe commission and omission errors associated with the individual classes, respectively. Unlike \nthe OA, K takes into account the possibility of agreements occurring by chance in a random \nclassification (Brown et al., 1998). \n In order to compare the two classifiers and to evaluate whether the integration of \ntopographic data can improve on the spectral-only mapping results, tests for statistically \nsignificant differences were computed. Although this commonly involves performing a Z-test \nusing the K statistics derived from two classification results (e.g., South et al., 2004; Liberti et \nal., 2009), this method is inappropriate for the current study as the same validation pixels are \nused to assess the accuracies of all classifications involved in pair-wise comparisons (Foody, \n2004). For cases where the validation data are related, the McNemar test is more appropriate for \ntesting the significance of any differences in classification accuracies (Foody, 2004; De Leeuw et \nal., 2006). Based upon a Chi-squared (\u03c72) distribution, the McNemar test involves a cross-\ntabulation of the number of validation pixels correctly and incorrectly classified through two \nalgorithms. The test is computed as:  \n \n2112\n2\n21122 )(\nff\nff\n, (3) \nwhere f12 is the number of validation pixels correctly classified in classification 1 but incorrectly \nclassified in classification 2, and f21 is the number of pixels classified correctly in classification \n2, but incorrectly classified in classification 1. The statistical significance of the difference is \nthen determined from the resulting \u03c72 value and expressed as a p-value (p). \n  \n \n5. Results and discussion \n5.1 Spectral classification \n A total of six lithological maps were generated using spectral information. Following \ninitial classification, use of the majority filter helped to remove isolated pixels in the classified \nimages by refining, on average, the classes of 1.5% of the total number of pixels in each image. \nAs a consequence, the OA of all maps was increased by an average of 1.3%. All subsequent \ndiscussion concerns the lithological maps produced following majority filtering. A summary of \nthe spectral-only lithological mapping results is shown in Table 6. \nThe best spectral-only result was obtained through SOM classification of the MNF-\ntransformed variables (ATM MNF), which resulted in an OA of 65.5% and a K of 0.54 (Fig. 5a). \nThe result of this algorithm is comparable to the OA (65.4%) obtained for the same area using \nonly LiDAR-derived topographic information (Grebby et al., 2010). Considering the complexity \nof the landscape and the adverse effects that vegetation cover can have on the spectral \ndiscrimination of lithologies, this is deemed to be a good result. The worst performing algorithm \nwas the SOM classification used in conjunction with the PC variables (ATM PC; OA = 50.2%, \nK = 0.35), resulting in decreases of 15% in the OA and 35% in K when compared to the ATM \nMNF approach. A similar finding was also observed for the MLC; decreases in the OA of 8% \nand 20% in K were obtained when classification was performed on the ATM PC variables in \ncontrast to the ATM MNF variables. Such concomitant differences imply that the MNF \ntransformation is more effective than PCA in enhancing discrimination through suppression of \nthe intra-class spectral variability ascribed to the heterogeneous vegetation\/rock surface mixtures \n(i.e., the predominant source noise in this case). The ascendancy of the MNF transformation is \ndoubtlessly due to the ability to target the desired noise component in the noise estimation and \nthen order the MNF bands in terms of their signal-to-noise ratio, thus enabling this noise to be \nreliably segregated prior to classification. In fact, the poor performance of both ATM PC \nclassifications in comparison to the non-transformed ATM 9 results (i.e., decreases of 10% in the \nOA and ~ 26% in K) suggests that PCA actually accentuates, rather than suppresses the \nvegetation-induced intra-class spectral variability. This is due to the inability of PCA to reliably \nidentify and separate the contributions of the signal and noise-related variances to the total data \nvariance contained within the higher-order PCs (Chen et al., 2003); the first three of which are \nincluded in the ATM PC variable set. Based on a comparison of the eigenvector loadings for the \nPC and MNF input variables, it appears that PC2 is responsible for accentuating the intra-class \nspectral variability because it maximises the contrast between pixels dominated by vegetation \nand those dominated by the exposed substrate. The exclusion of PC2 should therefore help to \nreduce the intra-class spectral variability and improve the classification results of the PCA \napproach. \nWith regards to classifier performance, the MLC outperforms the SOM in classifying two \nout of the three sets of spectral input variables. Although the observed differences in the OA \nbetween the MLC and SOM in both cases are only small (~ 1%), these are statistically significant \nnonetheless (p \u2264 0.001). Given the noisy spectral signatures associated with the ATM 9 variables, \nthe success of the MLC over the SOM is somewhat surprising as NNs are commonly touted as \nbeing more robust in handling noisy data than parametric classifiers (e.g., Ji, 2000). This result \nmay therefore indicate selection of sub-optimal SOM network parameters for classifications \nbased upon these two sets of variables. For the lone case in which the SOM outperforms the \nMLC (i.e., the ATM MNF variables) a more significant difference of ~ 6% is obtained (p < \n0.0001). The considerable superiority of the non-parametric SOM in this case could be \nattributable to a deviation from the multivariate class normality assumption made by the \nparametric MLC.  \n Of the individual lithological classes, the pillow lavas were the most accurately mapped \nunit with a PA and UA frequently exceeding 80% and 60% respectively, regardless of the \nalgorithm used (Table 7). The Lefkara Formation is also mapped with relatively good accuracy \nfor all sets of input variables, but especially when classification is performed using the SOM (PA \n> 71%). Despite this, the Lefkara Formation is associated with considerable commission errors, \nranging from 48\u201368% for all combinations of input variables and classification routine. An \ninspection of the error matrices (not shown) revealed that confusion with the Basal Group is \nlargely responsible for the high commission errors associated with the Lefkara Formation unit. \nSince these two units are geologically very distinct, this confusion must be ascribed to their \nassociations with similar vegetation types. Both the Basal Group and alluvium\u2013colluvium are \npoorly classified using both the MLC and SOM. The omission error for the Basal Group is \nconsistently greater than 54%, while the commission error varies from 40\u201360% for all \nalgorithms. Despite its close geological relationship to the pillow lava unit, a greater proportion \nof Basal Group validation pixels are incorrectly assigned to the Lefkara Formation; again \nreiterating that the spectral similarity between these distinct units must be related to their \nassociation with similar types of vegetation. Conversely, the occurrence of dissimilar vegetation \ntypes (i.e., shrubs vs. lichen) is arguably responsible for the lack of spectral confusion between \nthe Basal Group and pillow lavas. With the exception of classifications based upon the ATM \nMNF variables, the PA for alluvium\u2013colluvium never exceeds 50%, with the unit most \nfrequently confused with the Lefkara Formation and the other units to a lesser extent. Some \ndegree of confusion with the other units can be expected because alluvium-colluvium is a generic \nunit which includes all Quaternary sediments regardless of their parental rock type. Contrary to \nits poor PA, the alluvium\u2013colluvium unit exhibits the highest UA for all algorithms, with a \nmaximum of 99.8% for the MLC classification of the ATM MNF variables and a minimum of \n83.8% when using the ATM 9 variables in conjunction with the SOM.   \n \n5.2 Classification based on integrated spectral and topographic variables \n The use of ancillary data for enhancing the discrimination and mapping of lithologies was \nevaluated through incorporating LiDAR-derived topographic data using two approaches; \nresulting in the generation of four lithological maps. Again, all analysis concerns lithological \nmaps produced following the application of a majority filter. In this case, the majority filter \nhelped refine (on average) the classes of 0.9% of the total number of pixels in each image, \nleading to increases in the OA of all maps by an average of 1.4%. A summary of the integrated \nmapping results is shown in Table 8 and Table 9, while the statistical significance of differences \nbetween spectral and integrated classification accuracies can be found in Table 10.  \n Overall, the results show that the incorporation of topographic information leads to \ngeneral improvements in the overall lithological mapping accuracy when compared to \nclassifications based solely on spectral data. However, the level of improvement attainable is \nsomewhat classifier dependent. Once again the highest OA was obtained using the SOM \nclassifier in conjunction with MNF transformed variables (ATM-Li MNF; OA = 72.7%, K = \n0.63; Fig. 5b). This results in an OA at least 7% higher than \u2014 and significantly different (p  < \n0.0001) from \u2014 all spectral-only SOM classifications, with a maximum improvement of 22.5% \nover the ATM PC result. Highly significant statistical differences (p < 0.0001) were also observed \nbetween the SOM ATM-Li and all spectral-only SOM classifications; reflecting increases in the \nOA and K of at least 4.7% and 10%, respectively, when topographic information is incorporated. \nImprovements attainable using the MLC are somewhat varied. Compared to the best spectral-\nonly MLC result (ATM 9), MLC classification with the ATM-Li variables produced an increase \nin the OA of only 0.3%, which was subsequently found not to be a statistically significant \ndifference (61.6% vs. 61.9%; p = 0.1875). However, significant differences (p < 0.0001) were \nobtained in comparison to the ATM PC and ATM MNF MLC-based classifications, reflecting \nimprovements of \u22652.6% in the OA. Classification performed using the MLC and ATM-Li MNF \nvariables was less successful as this produced the worst classification accuracy of all the \nintegrated approaches (OA = 60.8%, K = 0.49). In actual fact, this algorithm performs worse \nthan the best MLC spectral approach (ATM 9). Nevertheless, the OA obtained using this \nalgorithm is higher and the result is statistically different (p < 0.002) from those achieved through \nthe two other spectral-only MLC approaches. Ultimately, the SOM is far superior for \nclassification of the multisource data as it outperforms the MLC considerably for both sets of \nintegrated variables (ATM-Li: 70.2% vs. 61.9%, p < 0.0001; ATM-Li MNF: 72.7% vs. 60.8%, p < \n0.0001). The dominancy of the NN over the parametric classifier for multisource data \nclassification observed here is consistent with other published results (e.g., Arora and Mathur, \n2001). Additionally, the SOM consistently achieves considerable improvements in the overall \nlithological mapping accuracy in comparison to sole use of spectral information. \n With regards to the individual classes, the pillow lava unit remains the most accurately \nmapped, with a PA in excess of ~ 82% for all algorithms. Good classification accuracies are \nachieved for the Lefkara Formation (PA > 63.4%), especially when classified using the MLC (PA \n> 88%). Despite this, the UA for the Lefkara Formation unit is relatively low, leading to \ncommission errors ranging from 41.3\u201359.4%. The alluvium\u2013colluvium unit is accurately mapped \nwith algorithms based on the SOM (PA > 75%), while excellent UA\u2019s (> 86%) are achieved for all \nalgorithms. Although the omission errors for the Basal Group are high for all algorithms (43.7\u2013\n59.6%), only small commission errors (< 25%) are attached to the unit. \nA summary of the effects of topographic integration on the individual class accuracies for \nthe SOM algorithms is provided by Fig. 6. From this, it is evident that improvements in the \nlithological mapping performance that result from the addition of topographic information are \nprimarily linked to substantial increases in both the PA associated with alluvium\u2013colluvium and \nthe UA of the Basal Group unit; reflecting decreases in the omission and commission errors of \nthe units, respectively. Spectral-only classifications typically produce considerable alluvium\u2013\ncolluvium omission errors because the alluvium\u2013colluvium unit is frequently confused with the \nparental rock types from which the sedimentary unit is derived. The integration of topographic \ninformation help reduces this confusion and the ensuing omission errors because, unlike its \nspectral signature which is inherently similar to the parental rocks from which the unit is derived, \nthe topographic characteristics associated with alluvium\u2013colluvium are distinctive (Grebby et al., \n2010). Likewise, the typical topography associated with the Basal Group is relatively disparate \nfrom the other lithological units \u2014 particularly in terms of slope \u2014 and so the inclusion of such \ninformation provides the additional discriminating power that is required to reduce the confusion \nlargely caused by vegetation-related spectral similarity with other units. Examples illustrating the \nfunctional benefits described above can be seen in Fig. 7. Although the overall mapping \nimprovements obtained through incorporating topographic information are indisputable, \nambiguous classifications occasionally occur in areas where the lithological units exhibit atypical \ntopographic characteristics \u2014 mostly due to anthropogenic activity such as agriculture. This is \nalso illustrated in Fig. 7 by the apparent increase in the number of Basal Group pixels proximal \nto the mapped Lefkara Formation\u2013pillow lava contact. In this particular case the source of the \natypically steep topography is unclear, but it is likely to be linked to underlying structures (e.g., a \nfault or dykes). \n It is also clearly evident that \u2014 despite the complexity of the landscape \u2014 both spectral-\nonly and integrated SOM approaches possess the capability to define lithological contacts more \naccurately and map the units in more detail than what is shown on existing geological maps (Fig. \n7). Although the best spectral-only approach (ATM MNF SOM) and LiDAR-derived \ntopographic approach (Grebby et al., 2010) can be used to generate accurate lithological maps, \nthe potential of data integration for detailed lithological mapping in this type of vegetated \nenvironment is clearly demonstrated through the significant improvements attainable over the \nsole use of either dataset. \n  \n6. Conclusions \nThe application of spectral remote sensing to lithological mapping can be hindered by the \npresence of just small amounts of vegetation cover, and so its use has been predominantly \nrestricted to essentially barren environments. Although lithological mapping using geobotanical \nrelationships and the integration of spectral and ancillary data are not new concepts, their use has \nbeen limited to data with only moderate-to-coarse spatial resolutions and areas with a relative \nlack of ubiquitous vegetation cover. This study takes advantage of increasingly available high-\nresolution remote sensing data to evaluate the efficacy of airborne multispectral imagery for \ndetailed lithological mapping in a complex and vegetated area of the Troodos ophiolite, Cyprus. \nFurthermore, this study also investigates whether spectral and LiDAR-derived topographic data \ncan be integrated to increase lithological discrimination and enhance the overall mapping \nperformance. \nLithological mapping using only spectral imagery was somewhat hindered by a \ncombination of the intra-class spectral variability caused by the heterogeneous vegetation cover, \nand by both vegetation-induced and inherent spectral similarities between some of the \nlithological units. Despite these hindrances, a lithological map with a satisfactory OA of 65.5% \nand K of 0.54 was generated through the SOM classification of a set of MNF-transformed \nspectral variables. The MNF transformation was effective in suppressing the intra-class spectral \nvariability (or \u2015noise\u2016) caused by the variable vegetation cover, and thus generally resulted in \nenhanced lithological discrimination in comparison to PCA and non-transformed spectral \nvariables. In fact, PCA accentuated the contrast between pixels dominated by the spectral \nresponse of vegetation and those dominated by the rock type, resulting in an adverse effect on \ndiscrimination. Nevertheless, regardless of the algorithm employed, distinct geobotanical \nassociations (i.e., lichen vs. shrubs) apparently aided the differentiation of the pillow lavas and \nthe closely related Basal Group unit. With regards to the classifier performances, the MLC \noutperformed the SOM in two of the three sets of spectral variables, possibly owing to sub-\noptimal SOM network selections. \nIncorporating high-resolution topographic information generally resulted in \nimprovements to the overall lithological mapping accuracy when compared to the spectral-only \napproaches. However, the attainable improvements are considerably greater for the SOM than \nfor the MLC. This result demonstrates the SOM\u2019s superiority for multisource data classification. \nThe most accurate lithological map is obtained using the SOM classifier in conjunction with the \nMNF-transformed spectral and topographic variables (OA = 72.7% and K = 0.63). This \nrepresents a minimum and maximum increase in the OA of 7% and 22.5%, respectively, when \ncompared to the corresponding spectral-only approaches. The improvements generated by the \naddition of topographic information are primarily linked to substantial decreases in both the \nomission error associated with alluvium\u2013colluvium and the commission error of the Basal Group \nunit. Both of these lithological units have particularly distinct topographic characteristics, which \nprovide the additional discriminatory power required to separate the lithologies following \ninherent or vegetation-induced spectral similarities. Occasional lithological misclassifications are \nobserved in areas where the units display atypical topographic characteristics due to either \nanthropogenic influences or natural deviations. \nThe optimum spectral-only and integrated SOM approaches presented here are capable of \nproducing lithological maps with more detail and more accurately defined contacts than the \nexisting geological maps of the study area. Furthermore, this capability is demonstrated using \nminimal a priori knowledge regarding the spatial distribution of each lithological unit, which \noffers great promise for lithological mapping in relatively unexplored terrain. Nevertheless, the \nefficacy of these algorithms can potentially be extended to any geological setting where direct \nspectral discrimination is difficult due to the presence of vegetation or inherent spectral \nsimilarities, and where lithology and topography are linked. It is also anticipated that the \nalgorithms can be successfully applied to areas with heavier vegetation cover, provided that \ngeobotanical and\/or litho-topographic relationships can be recognised. In particularly dense \nvegetation cover such as forests, it may be necessary to acquire the LiDAR data at a high point \ndensity in order to ensure an adequate DTM can be generated, thus maximising the capability to \nidentify potential litho-topographic relationships. \nIrrespective of the mapping capabilities of any remote sensing approach, the final \nlithological map product will always require additional refinement. This usually involves a \nlaborious combination of manual computer-based image refinement and fieldwork to eradicate \nspurious classifications from the map. Further work is required to investigate whether this \nprocess can be automated to some extent, possibly using a rule-based procedure which refines \nthe class of spurious pixels according to established stratigraphic relationships. This could \nultimately help to further increase the veracity of the derived map and the efficiency of follow-up \nfieldwork. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was primarily supported through a NERC CASE Studentship (NE\/F00673X\/1) in \ncollaboration with the British Geological Survey (BGS) University Funding Initiative, awarded \nto SG.
