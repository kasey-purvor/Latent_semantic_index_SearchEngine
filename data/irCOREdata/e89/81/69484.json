Introduction \nThe separation and purification of uranium from neptunium and\/or plutonium are major \nstages in the industrial scale reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel by the well known Purex \nprocess [2]. As described in our previous papers [3-6], the simple hydroxamic acids \naceto- and formo- hydroxamic acids (AHA and FHA), where for AHA, R=CH3 and for \nFHA, R=H, are salt free, hydrophilic organic compounds, RCONHOH, which act as \nbidentate O,O donor ligands and hence have high affinities for \u2018hard\u2019 cations such as \nFe3+, Np4+ and Pu4+. These ligands, generically represented as XHA, are also redox \nactive, electrochemical measurements having determined the onset potential for AHA \noxidation on a gold electrode as +0.62 vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) at pH 1 \n[7]. We have previously studied the reduction of Np(VI) by FHA and Pu(IV) ions by \nFHA and AHA [8-9]. Chung has also reported on the reduction of Np(VI) by AHA [10]. \nThese properties have led to them being identified as useful reagents for the control of \nPu and Np in novel hydrometallurgical based actinide separation processes for \nAdvanced Nuclear Fuel Cycles [3-5,11-12].  \nThe kinetics of the acid hydrolysis of FHA and AHA in nitric acid to form \nhydroxylamine and the parent carboxylic acid have been determined [13] and are found, \nat [HNO3] < 3 mol\u2022 dm-3 and when [HNO3] > [XHA], to obey Eq. (1). \n]H][XHA[Ae\ndt\n]XHA[d\nRT\nAE +\u2212=\u2212  (1) \nWhere, for FHA and AHA respectively, A, the pre-exponential factor, is 9.09 x 109 and \n3.22 x 109 dm3\u2022mol-1\u2022s-1 and EA, the activation energy, is 77.3 and 79.9 kJ\u2022mol-1. \nHowever, hydrolysis of hydroxamates bound to metal ions in a complex also occurs at \ndifferent rates leading to the regeneration of the non-complexed metal ion in solution. It \n3 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nhas also been shown that the Pu(IV)-XHA complex is slowly reduced to free Pu(III) \nions via the hydrolysis of the hydroxamate [9]. An understanding of these processes is \nvital if they are to be controlled within the design of any Advanced Purex process.  \nTo this end, we have used UV-visible and near-IR electronic absorption \nspectrophotometry to experimentally study the kinetics of the hydrolysis of metal-XHA \nsystems in nitrate media. Theoretical kinetic models have then been derived to interpret \nthe experimental data. The models form two cases: (i) the metal ion complexes with, but \ndoes not oxidise the ligand (i.e. Fe3+\/AHA; Np4+\/FHA, Np4+\/AHA) and hydrolysis \nregenerates the free metal ion in solution; (ii) the metal ion both complexes and oxidises \nthe ligand (Pu4+\/FHA; Pu4+\/AHA), thus reducing the metal ion. Our immediately \nprevious paper [1] reports our findings with respect to the Fe(III)-AHA system as a \nprototypical example of the first class of system. This paper applies the kinetic model \nderived for Fe(III)-AHA to industrially relevant Np(IV)-AHA and Np(IV)-FHA \nsystems, which behave analogously. The next paper in this series will extend the model \nto Pu(IV)-AHA complexes, an example of the second class of system. \n \n2. Experimental Methods \n2.1. Materials \nNp(IV) aqueous stock was prepared using standard methods, which have been described \npreviously [14], utilising stocks of NpO2 held at Sellafield. Typical procedures followed \nwere that, as required, gram quantities of the solid NpO2 were dissolved by refluxing in \nstrong HNO3 in a radiochemical glovebox for several days until virtually complete \n4 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \ndissolution was obtained. Following Np and acidity analyses, the resultant solution \nwould be decanted or filtered if required and diluted with HNO3 to give a working stock \nsolution. This would be sampled for acidity and Np analyses and checked \nspectrophotometrically for its valence purity. Np analysis was either by alpha \nspectrometry or low energy photon spectroscopy (LEPS) and the analytical results in \nBq\/ml converted to concentrations in mol\u2022dm-3; acidity was analysed in the standard \nmanner by acid-base titrations with KF added to prevent Np hydrolysis. In such \nsolutions, Np is present almost exclusively as Np(VI) with trace amounts of Np(V), the \nexact proportions dependent on factors including acidity and standing time. For this and \nrelated studies [14-15], Np stock solutions of 0.01 mol\u2022dm-3 in 0.1 mol\u2022dm-3 HNO3 and \n0.1 mol\u2022dm-3 Np in 1.0 HNO3 were prepared. Solutions of pure Np(IV) were obtained \nby reducing aliquots of the Np stock solution with substantial excess Fe(II) (as FeCl2), \ndiluted with HNO3 such that the overall acidity was usually between 2-3 mol\u2022dm-3 \nHNO3. The resultant Np(IV) solution was purified from Fe and Cl ions by solvent \nextraction into 30% tributyl phosphate (TBP) in odourless kerosene (OK) and \nbackwashing into 0.01 mol\u2022dm-3 HNO3. As the initial extraction extracted only 40-60 % \nof the Np(IV) the aqueous phase was often contacted with fresh TBP and the extracts \ncombined. Backwashing, however, was efficient and required only a single contact. \nExtraction and stripping were carried out in centrifuge tubes using a motorised paddle \nstirrer at, usually, 1:1 solvent to aqueous ratios with mixing times of typically 10-15 \nminutes. Acid concentration would then be adjusted by addition of HNO3 and the \nsolution sampled for Np analysis. These procedures were used at different scales \ndependent on the number of planned experiments, specific conditions required and \nworking limits in the fumehood. All solutions were made up accurately by volume. All \n5 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nother reagents, including HNO3 (70%, AnalaR, BDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, Dorset, \nUK), AHA (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd, UK) and FHA (custom synthesis by Tocris Cookson \nLtd, UK) were obtained from reputable suppliers at the highest available purity and \nused as received.  \nAHA and FHA were stored in a conventional refrigerator at 4 \u00b0C in order to prevent \ntheir decomposition. Solutions of FHA and AHA were prepared immediately prior to \nthe experiments by room temperature dissolution of an accurately weighed portion in to \ndistilled water to prevent hydroxamic acid hydrolysis.  \n \n2.2. Procedures \nUV-visible-near infra-red (near IR) electronic absorption spectra (EAS) were recorded \nusing a Perkin Elmer Lamda 19 spectrophotometer coupled by fibre optics to an \nexternal sample compartment for remote safe analysis of the \u03b1-active radioisotope \n237Np. Note that in the Figures the spectra have been offset for clearer comparisons. \nSolutions for the kinetic experiments on Np(IV)-FHA complex stability were prepared \nby mixing aliquots of Np(IV) stock, HNO3 and FHA directly into an optical cuvette \n(pathlength 1 cm). The complexant was added last. Solutions were mixed, stoppered \nand placed into the spectrophotometer whereupon data acquisition began immediately. \nDuring the kinetic absorbance measurements the spectrometer was set to scan the range \n350 \u2013 1000 nm at variable time intervals. Kinetic absorbance measurements were \nconducted over variable time periods up to a maximum of 900 minutes. \n6 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nSome problems were encountered in these experiments with baseline shifts between \nexperiments. This was probably an artefact of using remote analysis through long (10 \nm) fibre optics and, in some instances, inexact matrix matching in the reference beam. \nTo correct for this, absorbances at two points on the baseline either side of the peak \nbeing monitored were taken and averaged. This gave an average baseline absorbance \nthat can be subtracted from the peak absorbance to effectively correct for any baseline \nshifts. In generating the absorbance values used in the construction of Figs. 6 and 11, \nthe Np(IV)-XHA complex peaks at 714 and 732 nm were corrected at 650 and 775 nm. \nNote also that the detector change at ~845 nm can distort the spectra in this region (e.g. \nFig.4). \nCaution: Np-237 is an emitter of alpha radiation and all experiments were carried out on \nthe Sellafield nuclear licensed site in designated Controlled Areas under authorised \nspecific procedures developed for working with Ionising Radiation. \n \n3. Results and Discussion \n3.1. Speciation and Kinetic Modelling of Metal-Hydroxamic Acid Systems \nPrevious work has shown that the Np(IV)-AHA system forms complexes with \nAHA:metal ratios from 1:1 to 3:1 [15]. Stability constants (\u03b21-\u03b23) for these Np(IV)-\nAHA complexes were obtained in non-complexing perchlorate media at a constant ionic \nstrength. Unfortunately, the corresponding constants for the Np(IV)-FHA system were \nnot determined as FHA is both less readily available (only through custom synthesis, \nvide supra) and is much less stable than AHA. However, the Np(IV)-FHA system is \nexpected to behave in similar fashion to the Np(IV)-AHA system \u2013 consequently \n7 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \ninterconversions between the free metal ion and complexes at 298 K for the latter \nsystem can be considered as being analogous to the former, where the equilibrium \nconstants for the Np(IV)-AHA system in non-complexing perchlorate media are as \nfollows [15]: \n+++ +\u23af\u2192\u2190+ HNpLNpHL 3K4 1  K1 = 2754 (2a) \n+++ +\u23af\u23af \u2192\u2190+ HNpLNpLHL 22K3 2  K2 = 5.49 (2b)\n+++ +\u23af\u2192\u2190+ HNpLNpLHL 3K22 3  K3 = 4.47 x 10\n-2 (2c) \nWhere HL = hydroxamic acid, L = hydroxamate anion.  \nFrom our earlier study of the Fe(III)-AHA system [1], it was found that the dynamics of \nthe hydrolysis of the metal-AHA system in acid media such as HNO3 and HClO4 were \ncomplicated by metal-AHA complex speciation. Thus, in order to aid treatment of \ndynamic hydrolysis data obtained from the Np(IV)-XHA systems, initial speciation \ndiagrams were calculated for the Np(IV)-AHA systems at 298 K as a function of [AHA] \nand pH - see Figs. 1-2, where pH = -log10[H+] and pHL = -log10[AHA].

They do not allow for the weak complex formation that occurs \nbetween Np(IV) and NO3- via Eq. (4) in nitrate-containing media typical of reprocessing \nstreams [16]. We shall return to this point shortly. \n+\u2212+ +\u23af\u2192\u2190 43K33 NpNO)NO(Np D   (4) \nIn our previous work on the Fe(III)-AHA system, a kinetic model was developed that \ndescribed the hydrolysis of the Fe(III)-AHA complex. As both Fe(III) and Np(IV) do \nnot oxidise the ligand, unlike Pu(IV) [9], their behaviour is analagous and we can \nassume that the mechanism developed in the Fe(III) case applies to the Np(IV)-XHA \nsystem [1]. For the purposes of deriving an analytical solution, we assume that the \ndominant form of the complex in the pH and pHL regions of interest is the mono-\nhydroxamato species ML. Experimentally, this requirement can be fulfilled by careful \nchoice of reaction conditions using the speciation diagrams of Figs.1 & 2. Summarising \nthe key points from the hydrolysis model developed in reference [1], the mechanism of \nhydrolysis follows Eq. (5-7). \n++\u23af\u2192\u2190+ HCMHL 1K  (5a) \n++ +\u23af\u2192\u23af+ OHNHRCOOHHHL 3k0  (5b) \n++ ++\u23af\u2192\u23af+ OHNHRCOOHMmHC 3k1  (5c) \nwhere Mt  =  [Np4+] at time t; (6a) \n9 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \n HLt  =  [XHA] at time t; (6b) \n Ct  =  [metal ion-XHA complex] at time t; (6c) \n k\u20191  =  k1[H+]m  assumed by analogy with (6d) \n k\u20190  =  k0[H+]  in accordance with Eq.

Further, \ngiven that the pKa of both hydroxamic acids investigated in this study and subsequent \npapers in this series are greater than 8.5 (pKa (FHA) = 8.78 [17]; pKa (AHA) = 9.02 \n[18]), under the conditions employed in the experiments described below (pH < 1), the \ndominant form of the free ligand will be the acid rather than the deprotonated conjugate \nbase. Thus, direct hydrolysis of the hydroxamate ion may be neglected.

Eq. 15 is insoluble with respect to HLt. However, it can be used to \n11 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \ncalculate theoretical HLt vs t and, through eq. 11, Ct vs t plots. Curve fitting these to \nexperimental data allows for the extraction of values of key parameters such as k\u20191 = \nk1[H+]m as a function of [H+]. A plot of log10 (k1[H+]m) vs log[H+] then allows \ncalculation of values of m and k1. \nCurve fitting of experimental Ct vs t plots through use of eqs. 11 and 15 is facilitated by \nthe observation of k1 and K\u20191 having different effects on the shape of the calculated Ct \nvs t curve. These effects are illustrated in Fig.3 and may be qualitatively understood as \nfollows. The rate parameter k1 affects the overall duration of the decrease in \nconcentration of complex with time, although this effect is found to vanish for very \nsmall values of k1. This is readily understood in that once the process associated with k1 \n(eq. 5c) is much slower than the parallel process associated with k0 (eq. 5b) (i.e. k1[H+]m \n<< k0[H+]), the latter process determines the overall rate. In contrast, no matter the \noverall duration of the decay in complex concentration, the equilibrium constant K\u20191 \nonly affects the degree of sigmoid character in the Ct vs t profile with a pseudo-\ninduction period appearing at large K\u20191 during which Ct is invariant with time. The \nlarger K\u20191 at any one set of otherwise constant experimental conditions, the longer the \ninduction period before the concentration starts to decay. Again, this may be readily \nunderstood in that the larger K\u20191, the longer a significant \/ measurable concentration of \ncomplex will maintain during the overall decay time. \n3.2. Experimental Studies of the Np(IV)-AHA & Np(IV)-FHA Systems \nSection 3.1 described how the derivation of the kinetic model for AHA hydrolysis when \nbound to Np(IV) ions using available complexation constants. This section will present \nEAS data for the Np(IV)-AHA system and show how it can be understood in terms of \n12 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nthe speciation diagrams. By comparing EAS for Np(IV)-AHA and Np(IV)-FHA \nsystems we can then justify the application of the kinetic model to the Np(IV)-FHA \nhydrolysis data where complexation constants are not available and must be estimated \nduring the data processing. \nNear IR spectroscopy is a well established technique for monitoring Np oxidation states \nin solution [19-20]. Fig. 4 shows a Np(IV) spectrum in 0.1 mol\u2022dm-3 HNO3 in the \npresence of AHA at L:M ratios of 0:1 to 4.85:1. It can be seen that, in the presence of \nAHA, the spectrum is still characteristic of Np(IV) although the peak shapes have \nchanged notably. This contrasts with U(VI) and Pu(IV) AHA complexes where strong \ncolour changes and very different EAS are observed [13,21]. Comparison with Fig. 1 \nreveals that the spectrum obtained at an AHA:Np(IV) ratio of 0.97:1 (pHL = 2.31) was \nrecorded under conditions where the Np(AHA)3+ complex comprises 90% of all Np(IV) \npresent. A similar analysis of the spectrum obtained at an AHA:Np(IV) ratio of 4.85:1 \n(pHL = 1.61) indicates that it was recorded under conditions where the Np(AHA)3+ and \nNp(AHA)22+complexes comprise 53 and 47 % respectively of all Np(IV) present. Apart \nfrom minor variations the absorption spectra recorded at low and high total AHA \nconcentration are quite similar, implying a resemblance between the near IR spectra of \nthe 1:1 and 2:1 AHA-Np(IV) complexes. (It is worth noting at this point that use of Fig. \n1 as an aid to the analysis of Fig 4 should usually be conducted with caution. Fig. 1 was \ngenerated using Np(IV)-AHA complexation constants recorded in non-complexing \nperchlorate media whilst the data of Fig. 4 was recorded in nitrate media, NO3- forming \na weak complex with Np(IV) that dissociates in accordance with eq. 4. However, when \nthis weak complexation is explicitly accounted for in the speciation diagram, as in Fig. \n8 below, it is found that it has virtually no effect on the speciation of the Np(AHA)3+ \n13 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nand Np(AHA)22+complexes in the pHL range studied in Fig. 4 \u2013 thus those conclusions \ndrawn as a result of the comparison of Fig. 4 with Fig. 1 are valid.) \nThe resemblance between the near IR spectra of the 1:1 and 2:1 AHA-Np(IV) \ncomplexes is further highlighted by Fig. 5 which presents the absorbance spectra of a \nsolution of 0.005 mol\u2022dm-3 Np(IV), 0.1 mol\u2022dm-3 AHA (L:M = 20:1), recorded in the \npH range 0.8 to \u20130.6. Fig. 2 indicates that, at the lower end of this pH range at e.g. pH \u2013\n0.3, Np(AHA)3+ is the dominant species in solution while at higher pHs e.g. pH 0.8, \nNp(AHA)22+ dominates. The broad similarities between these two spectra indicate that \nthe spectral features of the mono-acetohydoxamato and di-acetohydroxamato complexes \nare near co-incident and so difficult to deconvolute. (It is again worth noting that Fig. 2 \nwas generated using Np(IV)-AHA complexation data recorded in non-complexing \nperchlorate whilst the data of Fig. 5 was recorded in nitrate media. However, when \ncomplexation of Np(IV) with nitrate is again explicitly accounted for, as in Fig. 9 \nbelow, it is found that it has no effect on the nature of the most dominant species at the \npHs selected for the comparison of their spectra \u2013 specifically pHs 0.8 and \u20130.3. Thus, \nthe conclusions drawn as a result of the comparison of Fig. 5 with Fig. 2 are valid.) \nFrom Fig. 5 it can be seen that the shapes of two of the main peaks at 714 and 732 nm \nremain largely unchanged up to 1 mol\u2022dm-3 HNO3. Fig. 6 then shows the absorbance at \n714 and 732 nm of a solution of 2.5 x 10-3 mol\u2022 dm-3 Np(IV) and 0.05 mol\u2022 dm-3 AHA \nas a function of [HNO3] in the range 0.1 to 4 mol\u2022dm-3 (pH 1 to \u20130.6). Inspection of the \nspeciation diagram shown in Fig. 2 leads us to expect that the dominant species are the \nNp(AHA)3+ and Np(AHA)22+ complexes, although this expectation should again be \ntreated with caution given that Fig. 2 was calculated for perchlorate media at total \n14 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nNp(IV) and AHA concentrations double those used in the experiment of Fig. 6. Due to \nthe coincidence of the absorption spectra in the 700-750 nm region noted above, we \nassume that the absorbances at 714 and 732 nm are compound entities, both being \ndirectly proportional to ([Np(AHA)3+] + [Np(AHA)22+]). We shall return to the validity \nof this assumption shortly. Fig. 6 then shows the fitting of calculated values of \n([Np(AHA)3+] + [Np(AHA)22+]) as a function of [HNO3] to experimental absorbance \ndata. The calculated values of [Np(AHA)3+] and [Np(AHA)22+] were obtained by use of \neqs. 16b and 16c. Eqs. 16 were produced by modification of eqs. 3 to account for the \nweak complexation of Np(IV) with nitrate. \n3\n123\n2\n121\nD\n3T\nT4\nKKKKKK1\nK\n]HNO[M4\nM\n]Np[\n\u03b3+\u03b3+\u03b3++\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +=\n+  \n(16a) \n3\n123\n2\n121\nD\n3T\nT13\nKKKKKK1\nK\n]HNO[M4\nMK\n]NpL[\n\u03b3+\u03b3+\u03b3++\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +\n\u03b3=+  (16b)\n3\n123\n2\n121\nD\n3T\nT\n2\n122\n2\nKKKKKK1\nK\n]HNO[M4\nMKK\n]NpL[\n\u03b3+\u03b3+\u03b3++\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +\n\u03b3=+  (16c) \n3\n123\n2\n121\nD\n3T\nT\n3\n123\n3\nKKKKKK1\nK\n]HNO[M4\nMKKK\n]NpL[\n\u03b3+\u03b3+\u03b3++\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +\n\u03b3=+  (16d)\nwhere [HNO3] is the nominal concentration of added nitric acid and KD, which is \ndefined by eq. 4, is used as a fitting parameter. K1, K2 and K3 are as given in eq. 2. \nThe illustrated fit to the experimental data in Fig. 5 was calculated using KD = 0.15. \nConsidering the assumptions made in this data fitting and the inherent difficulties in \nmeasuring equilibrium constants for weak bases of strong acids, this value is in good \n15 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nagreement with the accepted literature value of 0.46 (range 0.58-0.36) calculated from \nlog10K1 = 0.34 \u00b1 0.10, which was determined in 1 M HClO4 at 20 \u00b0C by Danesi and co-\nworkers [16,20]. \nThe derived value of KD can then be used to produce a speciation diagram, Fig. 7, \ncalculated as a function of pH for the experimental conditions employed in Fig. 6. \nInspection of Fig.7 indicates that the dominant species over the range of acidities used \nin Fig. 6 are the Np(AHA)3+ and Np(AHA)22+ complexes, which together comprise \n>95% of all Np(IV) at [H+] < 1 mol\u2022dm-3 and >70% at [H+] < 4 mol\u2022dm-3. This \nobservation, together with the value of KD obtained from the curve fitting exercise of \nFig. 6, validates our earlier assumption that the absorbances at 714 and 732 nm are \ncompound entities, both being directly proportional to ([Np(AHA)3+] + [Np(AHA)22+]). \nExperimental derivation of a value for KD = 0.15 now allows for Figs. 1-2 to be \nrecalculated using eqs. 16 and Np(IV)-AHA complexation constants as given in Eq. \n(2a-c). The resultant speciation diagrams for the Np(IV)-AHA system, which allow for \nnitrato complex formation, are shown in Figs. 8-9. \nFrom Eq. (1), the half lives for the acid catalysed hydrolysis of free FHA and AHA in 1 \nmol\u2022dm-3 HNO3 at 293 K are 1\u00bc and 10\u00bd hours respectively The half lives for both \nligands are less at higher acidities. The parameters k\u20191 and K\u20191 for the hydrolysis of \nbound XHA can be obtained from kinetic absorbance experiments by curve fitting \nnormalised absorbance vs t plots using Eqs. (11 & 15). However, use of these equations \nrequires the availability of an accurate and reliable value of k\u20190, the rate parameter \ndescribing the kinetics of the hydrolysis of the free ligand. It is widely held that the \nmechanism underpinning the description of k\u20190 given by Eq. (1) involves [22]:  \n16 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \n(i) rapid pre-equilibrium protonation of the carbonyl oxygen; followed by, \n(ii)  nucleophilic attack by water at the carbonyl carbon, resulting in the formation of a \ntetrahedral intermediate; followed by,  \n(iii) re-creation of carbonyl at the new tetrahedral C with loss of a hydroxylamine \nleaving group (NH2OH). \nHowever, at [HNO3] > 3 mol\u2022dm-3, there is a possibility of a departure from this \nmechanism and so the validity of Eq. (1) [22], thus making use of Eq. (11 & 15) \ndifficult at high acidities. Thus, even though the complexation constants for the Np(IV)-\nFHA system are unknown, it was decided that it would be both expeditious and \nappropriate to first study the effect of Np(IV) complexation on the hydrolysis of FHA at \nintermediate pH (pH > -0.1) rather than AHA at higher [H+] with its attendant risk of a \nmechanism change. \nAbsorption spectra of the Np(IV)-FHA system are given in Fig. 10, recorded as a \nfunction of nitric acid concentration, 0.1-3 mol\u2022 dm-3. There are broad similarities with \nthe Np(IV)-AHA spectra shown in Fig. 5; major peaks differ only by 1-2 nm. However, \nthere are some subtle differences. The absolute intensities of the absorbance features \nacross the wavelength ranges studied are lower for the Np(IV)-FHA system than \nNp(IV)-AHA. The 723 nm Np(IV)aq peak appears to remain in the spectra; the 975 nm \npeak decreases in intensity with increasing HNO3 and the 954 nm satellite peak is only \nclearly discernible in the intermediate spectra (0.40 and 1.01 M HNO3).  \nThese spectra suggest that whilst isostructural complexes are formed, complexation is \nsomewhat weaker with FHA than with AHA. It seems likely therefore that, as with \nAHA, the absorbances at 714 nm and 732 nm may be treated as compound entities \n17 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nwhose intensities are directly proportional to ([Np(FHA)3+] + [Np(FHA)22+]). The time \ndependence of the absorbance data recorded from Np(IV)-FHA systems at two nitric \nacid concentrations are shown in Fig. 11. Differences in the absorbance values at t=0 \nare due to the differences in complex speciation between the two pHs studied.  \nThe data of Fig. 11 can be analysed by use of Eqs. (11 & 15). However, these equations \nmake no allowance for the formation of Np(FHA)22+, although, as noted above, overall \ncomplexation in the Np(IV)-FHA system is weaker than in the Np(IV)-AHA. A \nrecalculation of Fig. 9 (not shown) based on this observation indicates that, in the pH \nregion of the measurements shown in Fig. 11, Np(FHA)22+ accounts for only ~15% of \nthe total concentration of Np species. This suggests that it is a reasonable approximation \nto assume that the contribution made by Np(IV)-FHA complexes to the absorbance data \nof Fig. 11 is derived mainly from the Np(FHA)3+ species. Eq. (15) is then be applicable \nto the data of Fig. 11. \nCurve-fitting the data of Fig. 11 to Eq. (11 & 15) is now relatively straightforward but \ninvolves a number of steps as follows: \n(i) the generation of a [Np(FHA)3+] or Ct vs t curve using eq 15 (producing a t vs HLt \nplot) in conjunction with eq 11 (generating a Ct vs t plot from the aforementioned t vs \nHLt plot); \n(ii) from the so-generated Ct vs t plot and the mass balance of eq. 8d, generation of an \nuncomplexed [metal ion] or Mt vs t plot; \n(iii) the conversion of both Ct vs t and Mt vs t plots to absorbance vs t plots; \n18 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \n(iv) the combining of the complex and metal ion absorbance vs t plots to give an overall \nabsorbance vs t plot; and finally \n(v) the fitting of the overall absorbance vs t plot to the experimental data of Fig. 11 by \nuse of K\u20191 and k\u20191 as fitting parameters in eq. 15 (see Figs. 3, vide supra). \nStep (iii) in this process requires the availability of extinction coefficients for both \nNp(FHA)3+ and the non FHA-complexed metal ion. The former can be obtained from \nthe measured absorption at long time for the absorbance vs t plot at [HNO3] = 1.3 \nmol\u2022dm-3 in Fig. 10. At this point, the model of eq. 5 suggests that all FHA has been \nhydrolysed and that absorbance is due entirely to uncomplexed Np, [Np(IV)] = 0.005 \nmol\u2022dm-3. This is supported by the fact that, at this acidity, the measured absorbance is \ninvariant with t at t > 35000 s. As the measured absorbance asymptotically approaches \n0.15 at long t, and given that a 1 cm cell was used in all measurements, an extinction \ncoefficient for the non-FHA complexed metal ion of 30 dm3\u2022mol-1\u2022cm-1 can be \nobtained. In-house measurements of the UV-visible and near-IR spectrum of Np(IV) as \na function of [HNO3] (not shown) indicate that the absorbance at the wavelength \nemployed in Fig. 11, \u03bb = 732 nm, is near invariant with nitric acid concentration around \n[HNO3] = 1 mol\u2022dm-3. Thus, the value of the extinction coefficient for non-FHA \ncomplexed Np(IV) derived at [HNO3] = 1.3 mol\u2022dm-3 can also be used in the \ninterpretation of the data recorded at [HNO3] = 0.79 mol\u2022dm-3. \nMeasured absorbance at t = 0 in Fig. 11 is greater at [HNO3] = 0.79 mol\u2022dm-3 than at \n[HNO3] = 1.3 mol\u2022dm-3 suggesting, as would be expected, that the concentration of \nFHA-complexed Np(IV) is greater at the lower acidity. If it is assumed that all Np(IV) \n19 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nis complexed with FHA at t = 0 at [HNO3] = 0.79 mol\u2022dm-3 then the measured \nabsorbance of 0.337 allows calculation of an extinction coefficient for FHA-complexed \nNp(IV) of 67.4 dm3\u2022mol-1\u2022cm-1. Interestingly, the measured absorbance of Np(FHA)3+ \nat 732 nm as a function of [HNO3] in a Np(IV)-FHA system comprised of 0.0025 \nNp(IV) mol\u2022dm-3 and 0.05 mol\u2022dm-3 FHA (not shown) exhibits a maximum saturation \nvalue of 0.17 at [HNO3] < 1 mol\u2022dm-3. This suggests that all Np(IV) is complexed with \nFHA, so allowing calculation of a value of the extinction coefficient of 68 dm3\u2022mol-\n1\u2022cm-1, in excellent agreement with the value calculated from Fig. 11. \nThus, use of extinction coefficient values of 30 and 68 dm3\u2022mol-1\u2022cm-1 for non-FHA \ncomplexed and FHA complexed Np(IV) respectively then allows for the execution of \nsteps (iii) to (v) above. As discussed in reference to Fig. 3 above, step (v) is facilitated \nby the fact that only two parameters are unknown for the Np(IV)-FHA system: K\u20191 and \nk\u20191, each parameter having a different effect on the shape of the calculated [Np(FHA)3+] \nvs time curve, so simplifying the fitting process (Fig. 3). Bearing this qualitative \ninterpretation in mind, the results of using Eq. (11), (15) and (8d) to curve fit the data of \nFig. 11 are shown in Fig. 12 and 13 for [HNO3] = 0.79 and 1.3 mol\u2022dm-3 respectively. \nBoth Figs. 12 and 13 shown separate calculated absorbance vs t plots for the non-FHA \ncomplexed metal ion and FHA complexed metal ion as well as the calculated compound \nabsorbance for both species. It is the latter that is fitted to the experimental data, also \nshown in each figure, with the following results. \nThe parameter k\u20191 is found to be less than 7.9 x 10-6 and 1.3 x 10-5 s-1 at 0.79 and 1.3 \nmol\u2022dm-3 nitric acid concentrations respectively. Use of lower values than this leads to \nno significant change in the calculated [Np(FHA)3+] vs time profiles, whilst larger \n20 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nvalues lead to a significant decrease in the quality of fit, no matter the value of K\u20191 \nemployed. Comparison of these values of k\u20191 with k\u20190 under the same conditions (1.19 x \n10-4 and 1.96 x 10-4 s-1 respectively) suggests that, over the range of acidities studied in \nFig. 11, complexation of FHA with Np(IV) actually protects the ligand against acid \ncatalysed hydrolysis.  \nThis result is in contrast to results observed from the Fe(III)-AHA system [1] which \nsuggests that complexation with Fe3+accelerates the rate of hydrolysis of AHA. This can \nperhaps be qualitatively understood through the observation that in the Fe(III)-AHA \nsystem a proton in the rate determining step interacts with a dipositive FeL2+ complex. \nIf it is assumed that analogous mechanisms to the Fe(III)-AHA system operate in the \nNp(IV)-FHA system, the complex would initially have a 3+ charge, NpL3+, so rendering \nthe interaction with a proton more unfavourable compared to the Fe(III)-AHA system.  \nK\u20191 is found to have values of 431 and 280 at 0.79 and 1.30 mol\u2022dm-3 nitric acid \nconcentrations respectively. Simultaneous solution of Eq. (12) at each concentration \nallows the extraction of values of KD and K1 of 0.15 and 2715 respectively. This value \nof KD derived from the Np(IV)-FHA kinetic data of Fig. 11 is in excellent agreement \nwith the value of 0.15 derived from the Np(IV)-AHA speciation data of Figs 6 and 7. \nThe derived value of K1 for the Np(IV)-FHA system also confirms the suggestion made \nfrom the absorption spectra that complexation of Np(IV) by FHA is weaker than with \nAHA, where the analogous parameter has a value of 2754 ((Eq. (2a)). This is consistent \nwith the pKa for FHA being less than that for AHA, 8.78 and 9.02 respectively [17-18], \nleading to the expectation that FHA will form less strong complexes with metal ions. \nQualitatively, the difference in both pKa and K1 values for FHA and AHA can be \n21 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nunderstood by noting that the methyl substituent on the CO group in AHA will exert a \nstronger electron-donating inductive effect than the corresponding H atom in FHA. \nA comparison of the theoretical total absorbance vs time profiles with the \nexperimentally measured total absorbanc vs t plots of Fig. 11 are shown in Figs. 12 and \n13. The excellent agreement further supports our assumption that, under the \nexperimental conditions employed in Fig. 11, the absorbance measured at 732 nm is, in \nthe first approximation, nearly entirely due to the Np(FHA)3+ species.  \n \n4. Conclusions \nNp(IV) readily complexes with both FHA and AHA in dilute nitric acid. This can be \nobserved by Np(IV) peak changes in the near IR region. The spectra of the 1:1 and 2:1 \nXHA-Np(IV) complexes bear a strong resemblance to each other making spectral de-\nconvolution a non-trivial exercise. However, with the aid of speciation diagrams, \nNp(IV) absorption spectra in the presence of AHA and FHA have been interpreted and \nexperimental conditions have been identified under which the 1:1 FHA-Np(IV) \ncomplex can be assumed to be the majority species.  \nSecondly, by application of a kinetic model derived for the analogous Fe(III)-AHA \nsystem, spectrophotometric studies of the acid-catalysed hydrolysis of FHA while \nbound to Np(IV) have been modelled and explained. This kinetic analysis also allows \nfor the calculation of the first complexation constant for the Np(IV)-FHA system, with \nK1 being found to have a value of 2715. Complexation by Np(IV) in the form of the 1:1 \ncomplex protects FHA against acid-catalysed hydrolysis and has useful implications for \n22 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nthe applications of XHAs in the reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel. In the context of \nan Advanced Purex process, the robustness of the associated process flow sheet would \nbe favourably enhanced by such protection. However, this work has focused on using \nexample data to validate that the kinetic model can be applied to Np(IV) and estimating \nK1 and k1\u2019 for the Np(IV)-FHA system. It now needs to be applied to a broader range of \nligand and nitric acid concentrations for both FHA and AHA to better refine the \ncomplexation and reaction rate parameters. Subsequent extension of these modelling \napproaches to Pu(IV) ions would then provide a sound basis to fully understand the \nstability of hydroxamic acids and their actinide complexes in process flow sheets. This \nwill be the subject of our next communication. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors wish to thank British Nuclear Fuels Ltd and the Nuclear Decommissioning \nAuthority (NDA) for financial support and for a post-doctoral research fellowship for \nFA.
