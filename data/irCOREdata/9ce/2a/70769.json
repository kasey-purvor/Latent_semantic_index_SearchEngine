The aim of our research project was to determine how \nvarious pragmatic measures of task-performance such as the pragmalinguistic markers of \nargumentation, the number of claims, counterclaims, supports and counter-supports were \naffected by task-repetition, the long-term development of language skills, task-content and a \nshort-term focussed intervention. We also analyzed how these variables differed when the \nparticipants performed the same type of task in their mother tongue. \n The results showed that familiarity with the structure of the task helped learners to pay \nmore attention to informational content of their message, which was reflected in better \nperformance in terms of the number of support they provided for their claims. Neither \nlanguage development assumed to have taken place during one year, nor the argumentation \ntraining resulted in the improvement of the participants' argumentation skills. Another  \nfinding of the study was that the type of task and the level of formality of the interaction have \nan effect on the pragmalinguistic measures of task-performance.  \n \n \n \n \nThe total number of words in the article is 5808. \n 3 \nPRAGMATIC ASPECTS OF TASK-PERFORMANCE: THE CASE OF \nARGUMENTATION \n \n \nI  Introduction \n \n The skill of argumentation has long been acknowledged as an integral component of \nacademic skills. Moreover, the ability to form and support an opinion is not only essential in \npursuing university or college studies, but in everyday and business life as well.  For this \nreason, in many countries (for example in the United States and in the United Kingdom) \nargumentation is explicitly taught already at secondary school level. In a number of other \ncountries, however, such as Hungary, where the study reported in this paper was conducted, \nsecondary school students only receive sporadic education in rhetorics. In these countries very \nfew books are available on what the rules of argumentation are even in the learners' mother \ntongue, not to mention foreign language textbooks. Nevertheless, when students enter a \nuniversity in Hungary, they are expected to be able to give voice to their opinion and support \nit adequately. It was this contradiction between the explicit teaching of argumentation and \nuniversity requirements in Hungary that motivated our investigation, which focussed on L2 \nlearners' performance in a series of oral argumentation tasks for a period of 2 years.   \nWhen reviewing the literature of task-based language learning (for a comprehensive \nreview see Skehan, 1998), we found that most studies in this field were concerned with the \nlinguistic measures of L2 learners' output in various tasks, and that very little is known today \nabout the pragmatic aspects of task-performance. Moreover, upon studying the body of \nresearch on task-based learning, it also became apparent that while a number of studies have \ninvestigated participants' performance across various types of tasks (e.g. Bygate, 1999; Foster \n& Skehan, 1996; Robinson, 1995; Robinson, Ting & Urwin, 1996; Skehan & Foster, 1996), \nthe issue of how the content of the task influences students' output has not been addressed. In \n 4 \naddition, at present we know of no studies that compared learners' performance in the same \ntype of task in L2 and the participants' L1. In order to gain an insight into these relatively \nunexplored areas of task-based learning, our study aimed to find an answer to the following \nquestions: \n1. How do task repetition, the long-term development of language skills, task-content, and a \nshort-term focussed intervention affect the quantity of arguments and the pragmalinguistic \nexpression of argumentation in oral argumentative tasks? \n2. How does performance in terms of the quantity of arguments produced and the \npragmalinguistic expression of argumentation differ in L1 and L2? \n \nII  Research on L2 learners' argumentation behaviour \n \n There has been extensive research on how various task characteristics influence task \nperformance and the summary of these studies has been reported in a number of articles (e.g. \nSkehan, 1998; Skehan & Foster, 1997), therefore here we will only summarise the relevant \nstudies on tasks that involved argumentation. Duff (1986) used a prioritising and a discussion \ntask to investigate interactional and discoursal differences. She found that the measures of \nmeaning negotiation did not differ to a significant extent, but the results showed that the \nlength of turns was significantly longer in the prioritising task than in the discussion task. \nFoster and Skehan (1996, 1997) and Skehan and Foster (1997) compared decision-making \ntasks with narrative and personal information exchange tasks. The findings of these series of \nstudies showed that decision-making tasks place a heavy cognitive load on learners in terms \nof conceptual planning, which in turn, results in the decrease of accuracy and fluency and in \nthe increase of complexity of the output. As can be seen from this brief summary, the \npragmalinguistic correlates of argumentation tasks have not been investigated yet in the \nframework of task-based language learning research, therefore it is instructive to turn studies \n 5 \nin other fields in this respect. \n The first systematic study of the organisation of oral argumentation in the 20\nth\n century \nthat is relevant to our purposes was carried out by Toulmin (1958), who claimed that the units \nof the analysis of arguments should be the premise, warrant, backing, qualification, rebuttal \nand conclusion. In the field of discourse analysis the investigation of argumentation gained \nmore importance in the 1980's. Schiffrin (1985) carried out a qualitative analysis of arguments \nin every day conversations in which she studied the discourse properties of rhetorical and \noppositional arguments. She considered \"monologues supporting a disputable position\" (p. \n37) rhetorical arguments, and \"discourse through which one or more speakers support openly \ndisputed positions\" (p. 37) oppositional arguments. Schiffrin found that oppositional \nargumentation involves both co-operation and competition, and it is characterised by the \n\"ongoing negotiation of referential, social and expressive meanings\" (p. 45). \n Kopperschmidt (1985) devised a complex system for the analysis of arguments, which \nhe defined as \"the use of a statement in a logical process of argumentation to support or \nweaken another statement whose validity is questionable or contentious\" (p. 159). He \nproposed the use of five analytical steps in the study of the macro-structure of argumentation: \n1. the definition of the problem, 2. the formulation of the contentious thesis, 3. the \nsegmentation of arguments, 4. the reconstruction of the argumentation strands, and 5. the \nreconstruction of an argumentative global structure. Kopperschmidt also drew up a system for \nthe investigation of the micro-structure of argumentation, which involved the analysis of the \nrole of the argumentative statements, the study of the argumentative potential and formal \nanalysis, which is concerned with argumentation patterns. \n Drawing on Toulmin's (1958) work, Tirkonnen-Condit (1985) carried out a study on \nthe problem-solution structure of argumentation, in which she identified four principal \nstructural components of the argumentative text: situation, problem, solution and evaluation. \nShe also concluded that various text types might contain an alternative combination of these \n 6 \ncomponents. Toulmin\u2019s (1958) model was also used in studies on contrastive rhetoric \n(Connor & Lauer, 1985, 1988; Connor, 1990). \n We do not know of any studies that have investigated the effect of the explicit \nteaching of argumentation skills in the field of oral argumentation. There is, however, an \nincreasing body of research on the development of L2 argumentative writing skills. The \nNORDTEXT and NORDWRITE projects were especially designed to investigate how L2 \nlearners acquire the skill of producing coherent written discourse (for a review see Enkvist, \n1985). In another study Varghese and Abrahams (1998) also examined the effectiveness of \ninstruction in argumentation at a university in Singapore. The 30 subjects who participated in \nthe research project received 12 week-long overt training with the help of materials developed \non the basis of Toulmin, Rieke and Janik's (1979) work. The results showed that students \nproduced \"more explicit claims, more specific and developed grounds and more reliable \nwarrants\" (p. 302) at the end of the course, although it has to be noted that their study lacked a \ncontrol group. \n \nIII Research on pragmatic development in L2 \n \n There have been a number of studies with cross-sectional design which investigated \nhow the development of L2 linguistic competence correlates with the acquisition of pragmatic \ncompetence (for a comprehensive review see Kasper & Schmidt, 1997). Kasper and Schmidt \n(1997) in their review of the body of literature concluded that L2 learners can access the same \nrange of speech act realization strategies as L1 speakers, regardless of their level of \nproficiency. Both cross-sectional (e.g. Blum-Kulka & Ohlstain, 1986; Maeshiba et al. 1996; \nTrosborg, 1987) and longitudinal studies (Bardovi-Harlig & Hartford, 1993; Ellis, 1992) \ncarried out with participants in L2 environment suggest that the development of L2 \nproficiency in general brings about pragmatic development. Nevertheless, the findings of \n 7 \nresearch on interlanguage pragmatics also showed that even L2 learners with high level of \ngrammatical or linguistic competence attain only a relatively low level of pragmatic \ncompetence (e.g. Faerch & Kasper, 1989; House & Kasper, 1987; Ohlstain & Blum-Kulka, \n1985; Takahashi & Beebe, 1987). Furthermore, ESL and EFL learners were also found to \ndiffer as regards their sensitivity to pragmatic errors (Bardovi-Harlig & D\u00f6rnyei, 1998) and \nthe target-like production of speech acts (Takahashi & Beebe, 1987). Bardovi-Harlig and  \nD\u00f6rnyei (1998) argued that the scarcity of available pragmatic input both inside and outside \nthe classroom accounts for their findings that L2 learners in a foreign language environment \nwere less sensitive to pragmatic violations than their peers in the United States. \n Very few experimental studies have been conducted in this field to date. The two \nstudies that investigated the effect of overt pragmatic training both involved German learners \nof English studying the language in Germany. Wildner-Bassett (1984) explored the effect \ninstruction on the use of conversational gambits and concluded that both the learners who \nwere taught with the communicative approach and those who learnt with the suggestopedic \napproach improved as regards the overall quality of the use of gambits. In House's (1997) \nresearch project, one group of the participants followed a communication course in which \npragmatics was taught explicitly, and in the other group learners received only implicit \npragmatic training. The results showed that the explicit group used a wider variety of gambits \nand discourse strategies, but the uptaking and responding behaviour of both groups remained \ndeficient. \n 8 \n \nIV  Method \n1 Participants \n Using data from a large-scale British-Hungarian research project conducted together \nwith Martin Bygate, Anita Cs\u00f6lle, Zolt\u00e1n D\u00f6rnyei, Dorottya Holl\u00f3 and Krisztina K\u00e1roly, in \nthe present study we analysed the speech samples of 24 EFL students, from three groups of \ntwo different secondary schools in Hungary. The two schools were of the same type and can \nbe considered similar to the British former grammar schools. Both schools provided general \ninstruction and prepared students for further studies in higher education. They were all \nrespectable but not particularly \u2018famous\u2019 or \u2018elite\u2019 schools.  \nThe participants were between 16 and 18 years old, and 8 of them were male and 16 \nfemale. On the basis of the C-test, we could conclude that members of Group 2 were \nsignificantly less proficient than learners both in Group 1 and 3 (F= 13.0.4,  p = 0.02). \nAlthough Group 1 scored highest on average on the language proficiency test, these students \nhad been previously instructed with the grammar translation method, and thus had little \nexperience in argumentation. The proficiency scores of Group 2 were the lowest, but students \nin this group were taught with the communicative method. Group 3 was also taught with the \ncommunicative method and attended a French-Hungarian bilingual class, consequently the \nmembers of this group spoke French at a near-native level. \n---------------------------------- \nInsert Table 1 around here \n---------------------------------- \n2 Settings and procedures \n \nThe data on which this study is based was collected between October 1996 and March \n1998, in the students\u2019 natural surroundings, during the regular English classes. At the onset of \n 9 \nthe study a C-test was administered to all participants. This instrument contains short texts, in \nwhich every second half of every second word has been deleted. Besides being easy to \nadminister, C-tests are assumed to provide a general picture of the test-takers' L2 competence \n(e.g. D\u00f6rnyei & Katona, 1992; Klein-Braley, 1985; Klein-Braley & Raatz, 1984). The test \nused in this study has been validated by D\u00f6rnyei and Katona (1992), who found the reliability \nof the test acceptable both in the case of university and secondary school students (r = 0.65 for \nuniversity students, r = 0.64 for secondary school students). The C-test administered to the \nparticipants consisted of three texts with 21 gaps each. \nThe instructions to the tasks were worded by the research group, but were presented to \nthe students by their regular teachers. Students worked in pairs simultaneously. In the tasks 12 \nitems were listed, of which students had to choose five in the preparation phase. The goal of \nthe communication phase was to persuade their partners of their choices, agree on three items \nand rank order them. Students were overtly instructed not to give in easily. The instructions \nand phases of the tasks were the same; they only differed in the topic given. Based on the \nteachers\u2019 opinions, the research team supposed that the content of the tasks was familiar to the \nstudents and did not require the use of specific vocabulary.  \nIn the first argumentative task students had to agree on extra-curricular classes the \nschool should offer (e.g. Spanish, karate, choir). In the second task students had to decide on \nwhere they would like to go on a school trip (e.g. visiting museums, bicycle tour wild \ncamping). The task students had to perform in Hungarian aimed at agreeing on how the \nmoney the got for decorating their classroom should be spent (e.g. green plants, painting, new \nchairs). In the pre-intervention task students could decide on social activities they would do in \ntheir district (e.g. performing in the kindergarten, delivering lunch for elderly people, editing \na local newspaper). In the post-intervention task, the participants had to choose what items \nthey would take with them on a trip to England (e.g. roller blades, spare pair of jeans, CDs, a \nhairdryer).  \n 10\n In January and February 1998, the two experimental groups received overt training in \nargumentation. The intervention was designed by the research team, including the teachers of \nthe experimental groups, who then conducted the training in their regular classes on the basis \nof uniform teaching materials. The training consisted of five classes of lexical instruction, and \nanother five classes taught argumentation skills to the students. The lexical training focussed \npartly on conversation strategies, teaching students fillers and hesitation devices, so that they \ncould gain time when a difficulty in communication occurs. Another aspect of the lexical \ntraining involved language functions that can be used in an argumentative discussion. These \nincluded the verbal expression of opinion, the language of agreement and disagreement. Most \nof the lexical training materials were based on D\u00f6rnyei & Thurrel (1992). \n The teaching of argumentation skills to the students comprised first the definition of \narguments, facts, and opinions. Then, students were instructed to formulate arguments and \nsupport them, paying a special attention to the ordering of supportive statements. A further \nunit introduced the notion of refutation to the students, and how they can use it in their \nargumentation. Finally, students had the opportunity to practice these skills in a problem-\nsolving activity. The content of the activities used during the teaching of argumentation skills \nwas different from the ones used during the data collection sessions. The materials used \nduring this phase of the training were based on Glendinning & Mantell (1983). After the \nintervention the students were recorded during the performance of another argumentative \ntask.    \nThe control group received a \u2018placebo\u2019 training in order to control for the Hawthorne \neffect. The teacher of the group was asked to discuss controversial issues with the students in \nten classes, but no explicit lexical or rhetorical training was provided. After the intervention, \nstudents in this group were recorded performing the same type of task as the experimental \ngroups.  \n \n 11\nV Analysis \nThe recorded performance of the students was transcribed by trained transcribers. First, \nthe number of arguments was counted. For the purpose of our analysis, argument was defined \nas a statement which takes a point of view and supports it with either emotional appeals or \nlogical reasoning (Varghese & Abraham, 1998). Arguments were further sub-divided into \nclaims, support, counter-claims and counter-support.  \u201cA statement or proposition that the \narguer wants the audience to accept and\/or act upon\u201d (Varghese & Abraham, 1998: 292) was \nconsidered a claim. \u201cFacts, examples, data, etc. offered in support of a claim\u201d (Varghese & \nAbraham, 1998: 292) were identified as support. Counterclaim was defined as a statement or \nproposition that refutes the interlocutor\u2019s claim, and facts, examples and data offered in \nsupport of the counterclaim were regarded as counter-support.  \nSample analysis:  \n \nC \nS \nA: Well, let's see what we put in the first place I think  first of all we have to take the \ncamera. This is the most important thing, because it's three weeks and there will be \nso many museums and everything \nCC B: Well, but I think I already have a er er small camera in my suit-case, in our suit- \ncase. \nS \nS \nA: Yes, but it's not the same to make simple photos and I think it's good fun, so we have \nto make some kind of films to to remember. \nCS B: Well, but we have we have so  so so  few things in our suit-case, and I think  \nC B:                        that a spare pair of jeans would be also necessary. \n(C = claim, S = support, CC = counter-claim, CS = counter support) \n \n The analysis of lexical expressions of argumentative speech acts was based on the use \nof lexical fillers, the frequency of linguistic markers expressing opinion (e.g. I think, in my \nopinion) or agreement (e.g. I agree, yes, OK, all right), and disagreement (e.g. I don\u2019t agree, \n 12\nNo, Yes but, but). Lexical fillers were defined as \u201cwords or gambits to fill pauses, to stall, and \nto gain time in order to keep the communication channel open and maintain discourse at times \nof difficulty\u201d (D\u00f6rnyei & Kormos, 1998:  369) (e.g. well, you know, etc.,). The type and total \nnumber of linguistic markers were coded and the frequency of the latter was calculated for \n100 words spoken.  \nIn the case of the analysis of the participants\u2019 argumentation behaviour, the two \nauthors coded the data separately following a common rater training. In the case of \ndisagreement, the problematic elements were discussed and a consensus was reached.  The \ndata were processed by a statistical programme (SPSS). \n \nVI Results and discussion \n \n1 Performance of groups across tasks \n \nIn the case of the first four tasks we compared the performance of the three groups in \nterms of the variables investigated in the study by means of one-way analysis of variance. As \nno significant difference was found among the three groups in any respect in any of the first \nfour tasks, we pooled the data of the students in Tasks 1, 2, 3 and 4 and carried out the \nstatistical analyses on this unified database. \nTable 2 shows the results of the repeated measure ANOVA procedure, which was \ncarried out to examine whether various aspects of the participants\u2019 performance in the four \ntasks differed. \n---------------------------------- \nInsert Table 2 around here \n---------------------------------- \n \nThe repeated measure ANOVA procedure showed significant task effect in the case of the \n 13\ntotal number of support (F= 5.92, p = 0.00), counter-support (F= 4.47, p = 0.01), counter-\nclaims (F= 5.92, p = 0.00), and the total number of counter-arguments (F= 3.80, p = 0.02). No \nsuch effect was found in the case of the number of claims (F= 0.45, p = 0.72), the total \nnumber of claims (F= 1.20, p = 0.32), support for claims (F= 2.03, p = 0.12) and total number \nof arguments (F= 1.23, p = 0.31). In the case of the number of claims and total number of \nclaims, the lack of task effect is understandable, as we observed in the tape-scripts that the \nnumber of claims made by pairs of students was identical with the number of different options \nthey had selected. Thus we can conclude that in this prioritizing task, the number of claims is \nneither language nor task-content dependent, but is determined by the task specifications. It \nwas interesting to observe, however, that no task and language effect was found in the case of \nsupport for claims and the total number of arguments. On the one hand, the lack of such effect \nmight have been caused by the task specifications. On the other hand, if we examine Table 2, \nit can be seen that students did not even provide two supports for one claim in any of the \ntasks, and the total number of argumentative utterances in the whole task on average was \nbetween 7.66 and 9.80. If we consider that the average number of turns produced by the \nparticipants was 16.81 in the four tasks, it can be seen that approximately only every second \nturn of the students contained an argumentative utterance. The participants' performance in \nthese aspects was below our expectations and signals the effect of the lack of education in \nrhetorics in Hungary.  \nIn the case of the variables where the repeated measure ANOVA showed significant task \neffect, paired-sampled t-tests were carried out. These tests revealed that students produced \nsignificantly more support (t = 2.37, p = 0.03) and counter-support (t = 2.5, p = 0.04) in Task \n2 than in Task 1. The results support Bygate's (1996a, b) findings and assumptions that task \nrepetition reduces the cognitive load the content of the task poses for students and helps to \npay more attention to linguistic form.  We can extend Bygate's line of argumentation and \nclaim that familiarity with the structure of the task in itself, without familiarity with content, \n 14\nfrees learner's capacity to pay attention to argue more successfully, that is, to provide more \nsupport for their claims. This means that familiarity with a task might not only trigger better \nperformance in terms of linguistic features, but in terms of informational content as well.  \nThe participants' performance in Task 3, which was recorded a year later, did not differ \nfrom either Task 1 or Task 2 in any of the variables investigated. Lacking measures of \nlearners' language development between the recording of the first two tasks and Task 3, we \ncannot draw firm conclusions from this finding. We can only speculate that the participants' \nlevel of proficiency might have developed in these 12 months, since they received between \n120 and 160 hours of instruction during this time. Despite the assumed development of \nlanguage skills, students' argumentation skills did not show any improvement. On the one \nhand, this might suggest that without explicit instruction the ability to argue effectively does \nnot develop. On the other hand, the increase in the learners' level of L2 competence might not \nhave been sufficient to provide them with more linguistic tools to persuade each other. \nThe paired sample t-tests showed that the task performed in Hungarian differed \nsignificantly from all the other tasks in a number of respects. Students produced significantly \nmore support in their L1 than in Task 1 (t = 4.38, p = 0.00), Task 2 (t = 3.15, p = 0.01), and \nTask 3 (t = 3.05, p = 0.01). Similarly, counter-support in the Hungarian task was also \nsignificantly more frequent than in Task 1 (t = 2.90, p = 0.01) and Task 3  (t = 2.89, p = 0.01). \nFurthermore, the number of counter-arguments produced in the Hungarian task was also \nsignificantly higher than in Task 1 (t = 2.79, p = 0.01), Task 2 (t =  2.14, p = 0.05) and in Task \n3 (t = 2.36, p = 0.03). These results suggest an important difference between students' ability \nto provide counter-arguments and support for their claims in their mother tongue and in a \nforeign language. It seems that participants of this study were able to support their claims \nrelatively successfully and come up with counter-arguments in their mother tongue, but they \neither did not transfer these skills to L2 or their competence in L2 was not sufficient for this \ntransfer to take place. These findings show that the participants acquired various sub-skills of \n 15\nargumentation in their mother tongue to a different extent. They show generally poor \nperformance in terms of the total number of arguments for their opinion, but they are certainly \nbetter at providing support for their statements as well as at arguing against their interlocutor's \npoint of view in Hungarian than in English. \n The frequency of lexical expression of argumentation in the various tasks was also \nstudied by means of the repeated measure ANOVA procedure (see Table 3). Significant task-\neffect was obtained in the case of the frequency of lexical fillers (F = 3.75, p = 0.01). The \npaired sample t-tests showed that participants used significantly more lexical fillers when \nperforming the task in Hungarian than in Task 1 (t = 2.49, p = 0.02), Task 2 (t = 2.29, p = \n0,03), and Task 3 (t = 3.00, p = 0.01). In the case of the frequency (F = 1.40, p = 0.25) and the \ntype of linguistic markers of expressing opinion (F = 1.23, p = 0.31), and the frequency of the \nmarkers of expressing agreement (F = 1.48, p = 0.23), no significant task effect was found, \nthat is, these variables did not differ to a significant extent in the four tasks analyzed. As \nregards the types of linguistic markers of expressing agreement, the repeated measure \nANOVA procedure showed a significant task effect (F = 3.73, p = 0.01). The paired sample t-\ntest revealed that the participants used significantly more types of linguistic markers for \nexpressing agreement in the Hungarian task than in Task 1 (t = 3.15, p = 0.01). Again task \nrepetition, language development and the intervention did not affect the frequency of this \nvariable to a significant extent. The frequency and the type of linguistic markers of expressing \ndisagreement did not differ significantly in the four tasks either. \n \n---------------------------------- \nInsert Table 3 around here \n---------------------------------- \n \nAs the results indicate, the repetition of the task did not significantly influence the \n 16\nfrequency of  any of the lexical expressions of argumentation. Familiarity with the structure \nof the task did not induce the more extensive use of lexical markers of argumentation. This is \nan interesting result since as mentioned above, task repetition helped students to argue more \nsuccessfully. It seems that due to the lack of focus on teaching pragmatics in Hungarian \nsecondary schools, students did not use their freed attentional resources for using more varied \nand more frequent pragmalinguistic markers of argumentation. Findings concerning the effect \nof L2 development support assumptions of previous research which claimed that in a foreign \nlanguage environment the general development of linguistic competence does not necessarily \ntrigger pragmatic development (e.g. Bardovi-Harlig & D\u00f6rnyei 1998, Takahashi & Beebe, \n1987), that is, students will use pragmalinguistic forms only if they are taught explicitly.  \nThe effect of the mother tongue is also relatively limited. We can see that only lexical \nfillers were used more frequently in L1 than in any of the tasks in L2, and differences between \nthe variety of markers for expressing agreement only differed in the first task students \nperformed in English (Task 1) and in Hungarian. It might be presumed that either the type of \ntask given to the students or the level of formality in the interaction between the students, or \nboth of these factors constrained the use of pragmalinguistic markers of argumentation both in \nL1 and in L2. \n \n2 The effect of treatment  \n \nThe treatment on argumentation seemed to result in little effect as regards the \nproduction of claims, counter-claims, support and counter-support. We did not find significant \ndifferences in the performance gain of the control and experimental groups in any of the \nmeasures of argumentative behaviour (see Table 4). As can be seen in Table 4, despite the \ntraining the treatment group, similar to the control group, performed worse in the post-\ntreatment task. As we realized upon the analysis, in this task some of the options given \n 17\ndepended on personal habits, for example whether one takes a hair-dryer to a trip depends on \nwhether one generally dries her\/his hair or not. This difference in content seems to be the \nreason why students spent most of the time in the post-intervention task discussing the \nchoices where personal habits played an important role. It is a common knowledge in the \nliterature of teaching argumentation (e.g. Smalley & Ruetten, 1995) that it is difficult to argue \nabout issues where personal habits are involved. Thus, the difficulty caused by the content of \nthe task might have resulted in worse performance. \n---------------------------------- \nInsert Table 4 around here \n---------------------------------- \nThe difference between the level of difficulty of the tasks, however, does not explain \nwhy the training did not result in differences between the performance of the control and the \nexperimental groups. On the one hand, it might be presumed that the treatment was not \nintensive and long enough to provide learners with sufficient input and opportunities to \npractice. On the other hand, as mentioned above, participants exhibited better skills in \nargumentation in Hungarian than in English. Thus it might well be possible that despite the \nlack of explicit education in rhetorics, these students master several sub-skills of \nargumentation in Hungarian, and it is the lack of L2 competence that prevents them from \nbeing able to express and defend their point of view in English. In this case the training in \nargumentation in itself cannot help students to argue more successfully. \n As regards the linguistic expression of argumentation, the performance of the \ntreatment group improved in two aspects. As a result of the training, they used a wider variety \nof fillers (t = 2.75, p = 0.02) and markers of expressing agreement (t = 2.61, p = 0.02) than the \ncontrol group (see Table 5). In the case of the frequency of expressing agreement, a negative \ngain can be observed, but the performance of the students in the treatment group deteriorated \nto a significantly smaller extent than that of the control group (t = 2.07, p = 0.05).  \n 18\n---------------------------------- \nInsert Table 5 around here \n---------------------------------- \nThe reason for the effectiveness of the training probably lies in the fact that fillers are \nnot complicated to use, since very few contextual restraints govern their use. Therefore, \nstudents could easily apply new types of these markers learnt during the treatment. The \nexplicit teaching of the various means of expressing agreement might have called students\u2019 \nattention to the need to use more varied means of linguistic expressions of agreement. The \nnegative gain in the frequency of the linguistic expression of agreement can be due to the \ncontent of the post-intervention task. As mentioned above, in this task students were asked to \nargue about objects which were related to personal habits. Argumentation in which personal \nhabits are involved is more difficult, since it is generally difficult to convince people to give \nup their personal habits. In the pre-intervention task students had to discuss social activities \n(e.g. cleaning the park, feeding the birds, delivering lunch to elderly people etc.). The \ndifference in the content of the pre-intervention and post-intervention task might account for \nthe fact that both groups of participants performed worse in the post-intervention task. \nNevertheless, as can be seen in Table 5, the performance of the treatment group was affected \nto a smaller extent by this difference than that of the control group. \n The frequency of fillers, however, did not increase as a result of the treatment. This is \nprobably due to the fact that fillers are mainly used by L2 learners to gain time to cope with \nlinguistic or conceptual problems (D\u00f6rnyei & Kormos, 1998), and therefore the cognitive \ncomplexity of the task and the level of students\u2019 L2 competence constrained their use. The \nfrequency and type of linguistic markers of opinion did not seem to be affected by the training \neither. The comparative Hungarian data (see Table 3) show that the frequency and type of \nmarkers of opinion is very similar to the frequency found in both of the English tasks. We \npresume that the level of formality between the students influenced the use of linguistic \n 19\nmarkers of opinion. The participants might have perceived that by adding more markers of \nopinion they would seem opinionated or over-formal in the given interaction. \n The frequency of markers of disagreement increased to a similar extent both in the \ncontrol and treatment groups. The reason for this can be that how often one expresses \ndisagreement largely depends on what one\u2019s interlocutor says. In other words, the difference \nin the point of view of the participants concerning the given subject might have affected the \nfrequency of linguistic markers of disagreement to a greater extent than the knowledge of \nthese markers. As regards the type of linguistic markers of disagreement, both groups showed \nsimilar improvement. We can only speculate that certain task characteristics, such as the \nextent of disagreement provoked by its content, might have overridden the effect of training. \n 20\nVII Conclusion \n \n The study reported in this paper investigated a relatively under-explored area of task-\nbased language learning research: the pragmatic aspects of task-performance. Our aim was to \ngain an insight into how pragmatic measures of task-performance were affected by task-\nrepetition, the long-term development of language skills, task-content and a short-term \nfocussed intervention. \n Task-repetition helped learners to familiarize themselves with the structure of the task, \nand despite the different content of the two tasks, participants provided more support for their \nclaims when performing the same type of task for the second time. Therefore we concluded \nthat familiarity with the structure of the task frees learners' attentional resources to pay more \nattention to informational content. The results, however, also suggested that task-repetition \ndoes not induce better pragmalinguistic performance. \n Language development that was assumed to have taken place within a year did not \nresult in better performance in terms of the arguments and their pragmalinguistic expression. \nWe presume that this is related to the finding that participants showed better argumentation \nskills in a number of respects in their mother tongue than in English. The results suggest that \nthe level of L2 proficiency prevented the students from being able to use their argumentation \nskills in English. This might have been the reason for the lack of success of the argumentation \ntraining as well. Another interesting finding of the project was that the type of task and the \nlevel of formality of the interaction between the students seem to have a considerable effect \non the pragmalinguistic measures of task-performance. This influence results in the similar \nfrequency and variety of the linguistic markers of argumentation both in English and in \nHungarian. \n The findings of this study can have potential implications for language teaching. First \nof all, they show that familiarizing learners with the structure of a task can enable them to \n 21\ncommunicate more successfully in terms of informational content. Secondly, the results \nindicate that several types of tasks with interlocutors assuming different roles need to be used \nfor practicing pragmalinguistic markers. Thirdly, the findings demonstrate that rhetorics needs \nto be taught more intensively and for a longer period of time, as a few lesson-long rhetoric \ntraining is not effective in itself. Finally if teachers aim to induce successful argumentative \nbehaviour with a prioritizing task, they should specify the task in a way that it should not \ninvolve personal habits as options to choose from. \n The study described in this paper has several limitations. Despite the fact that \nconsiderable efforts were made to have the same students work in pairs, sometimes the \nparticipants had different partners which might have affected their performance. When \ndesigning the project, we also assumed that if we keep all the facets of task-input except for \nthe task-content constant, we would gain absolutely comparable data. The results of the study, \nhowever, did not confirm this presumption. These short-comings point to the need that in \norder to verify many of the results described in this paper, a more controlled study should be \ncarried out. In addition the effect of task-content on L2 learners' performance should also be \nstudied in more detail. \n 22\nREFERENCES \n \nBardovi-Harlig, K. and D\u00f6rnyei, Z. 1998: Do language learners recognize pragmatic \nviolations?
