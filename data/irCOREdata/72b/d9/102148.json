The taxonomy groups together\nagents (community members) who develop a set of notions. If no constraints are imposed on how it\nis built, a knowledge community taxonomy may become extremely complex and difficult to analyze.\nWe consider two approaches to building a concise representation respecting the underlying structural\nrelationships, while hiding uninteresting and\/or superfluous information: a pruning strategy based\non the notion of concept stability and a representational improvement based on nested line diagrams\nand \u201czooming\u201d. We illustrate the methods on two examples: a community of embryologists and a\ncommunity of researchers in complex systems.\n1 Introduction\nA knowledge community is a group of agents who produce and exchange knowledge within a given knowl-\nedge field, achieving a widespread social cognition task in a rather decentralized, collectively interactive,\nand networked fashion. The study of such communities is usually a focal topic for social epistemology as\nwell as in scientometrics and political science [27, 17, 12], inter alia.\nIn particular, a traditional concern relates to the description of the structure of knowledge communities\n[20] generally organized in several subcommunities. In contrast to the limited, subjective, and implicit\nrepresentation that agents have of their own global community\u2014a folk taxonomy [1]\u2014epistemologists\ntypically use expert-made taxonomies, which are more reliable but which still fall short in terms of precision,\nobjectivity, and comprehensiveness.\nWe describe here an application of formal concept analysis (FCA) aimed at representing a meaningful\nstructure of a given knowledge community in the form of a lattice-based taxonomy built upon groups of\nagents jointly manipulating some notions. Formal concepts in this case relate loosely to the sociological\nidea of \u201cstructural equivalence\u201d [18], denoting groups of agents linked jointly to certain sets of terms.\nThis work is a development of the approach presented in [24, 25], where it was shown how to use FCA\nto identify the main fields in a scientific community and describe their taxonomy with several levels of\ndetail. Sect. 2 gives an overview of the approach. In Sect. 3, we concentrate on how to make lattice-based\ntaxonomies concise and intelligible. Concept lattices faithfully represent every trait in data, including\nthose due to noise. Therefore, we need tools that would allow us to abstract from insignificant and noisy\n\u2217Center of Research in Social Simulation (CRESS), Department of Sociology, University of Surrey, UK and European\nCenter for Living Technology, Venice, Italy, camille.roth@polytechnique.edu\n\u2020Department of Computer Science, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa, sergei.obj@gmail.com and\ndkourie@cs.up.ac.za\n1\nfeatures. To this end, we suggest a pruning technique based on stability indices of concepts [15] and\napply it on its own, as well as in combination with nested line diagrams [8] and \u201czoomed\u201d diagrams. These\ndiagrams allow for representing the community structure at various levels of precision, depending on which\nsubcommunities are most interesting to the user of the taxonomy. The techniques described in Sect. 3\nadmit modifications, which are a subject for further research and experiment. Some possible directions\nand open questions are listed in Sect. 4.\n2 A Formal Concept Analysis Approach in Applied Epistemol-\nogy\n2.1 Framework\nRepresenting taxonomies of knowledge communities has usually been an issue for applied epistemology and\nscientometrics [17], addressed notably by describing community partitions with trees or two-dimensional\nmaps of agents and topics. Various quantitative methods are being used, often based on categorization\ntechniques and data describing links between authors, papers, and\/or notions\u2014such as co-citation [20],\nco-authorship [9], or co-occurrence data [21].\nThe lattice-based taxonomies discussed here allow overlapping category building, with agents possibly\nbelonging to several communities at once, and render a finer and more accurate structure of knowledge\nfields by representing various kinds of interrelationships. Our notion of a community is both looser and\nmore general than the sociological notion of structural equivalence [18] in that we identify maximal groups\nof agents linked jointly to various sets of notions instead of exactly the same notions.\nA similar problem of identifying communities exists in the area of social networks. Lattices have also\nbeen used there [29, 7, 6], but in that context, groups of agents (or actors) are generally considered to\nbe disjoint and a lattice is only a first step in their construction. Besides, social network researchers are\ninterested in social aspects of the community structure (who the leaders are, how they influence peripheral\nmembers, how actors cooperate within their own group and between different groups, etc.), whereas we\nrather try to discover a structure of a scientific field (and are not particularly concerned with individuals).\nBecause of these differences in emphasis, social network lattices are typically based on data describing\ninteraction and relations between actors, while our data, as it will be seen later, describes actors in terms\nof the domain for which we want to build a taxonomy.\nBefore proceeding, we briefly recall the FCA terminology [8]. Given a (formal) context K = (G,M, I),\nwhere G is called a set of objects, M is called a set of attributes, and the binary relation I \u2286 G\u00d7M specifies\nwhich objects have which attributes, the derivation operators (\u00b7)I are defined for A \u2286 G and B \u2286 M as\nfollows:\nAI = {m \u2208M | \u2200g \u2208 A : gIm};\nBI = {g \u2208 G | \u2200m \u2208 B : gIm}.\nIn words, AI is the set of attributes common to all objects of A and BI is the set of objects sharing all\nattributes of B.\nIf this does not result in ambiguity, (\u00b7)\u2032 is used instead of (\u00b7)I . The double application of (\u00b7)\u2032 is a closure\noperator, i.e., (\u00b7)\u2032\u2032 is extensive, idempotent, and monotonous. Therefore, sets A\u2032\u2032 and B\u2032\u2032 are said to be\nclosed.\nA (formal) concept of the context (G,M, I) is a pair (A,B), where A \u2286 G, B \u2286 M , A = B\u2032, and\nB = A\u2032. In this case, we also have A = A\u2032\u2032 and B = B\u2032\u2032. The set A is called the extent and B is called\nthe intent of the concept (A,B).\nA concept (A,B) is a subconcept of (C,D) if A \u2286 C (equivalently, D \u2286 B). In this case, (C,D) is\ncalled a superconcept of (A,B). We write (A,B) \u2264 (C,D) and define the relations \u2265, <, and > as usual. If\n(A,B) < (C,D) and there is no (E,F ) such that (A,B) < (E,F ) < (C,D), then (A,B) is a lower neighbor\nof (C,D) and (C,D) is an upper neighbor of (A,B); notation: (A,B) \u227a (C,D) and (C,D) \u001f (A,B).\nThe set of all concepts ordered by \u2264 forms a lattice, which is denoted by B(K) and called the concept\nlattice of the context K. The relation \u227a defines edges in the covering graph of B(K). The meet and join\nin the lattice are denoted by \u2227 and \u2228, respectively.\n2\nAn expression B \u2192 D, where B \u2286M and D \u2286M , is called an (attribute) implication. An implication\nB \u2192 D holds in the context (G,M, I) if all objects from G that have all attributes from B also have all\nattributes from D, i.e., B\u2032 \u2286 D\u2032 (equivalently, D\u2032\u2032 \u2286 B\u2032\u2032). The set of all implications is summarized by\nthe Duquenne\u2013Guigues basis [11].\n2.2 Epistemic community taxonomy\nOur primary data consists of scientific papers dealing with a certain (relatively broad) topic, from which\nwe construct a set G of authors and a set M of terms and notions used in these papers. Thus, we have\na context (G,M, I), where I describes which author uses which term in one of his or her papers: gIm iff\ng uses m. Then, for a group of authors A \u2286 G, A\u2032 represents notions being used by every author a \u2208 A,\nwhile, for a set of notions B \u2286M , B\u2032 is the set of authors using every notion b \u2208 B. Thus, we see notions\nas cognitive properties of authors who use them (skills in scientific fields).\nThe intent of a concept in this context is a subtopic and the extent is the set of all authors active in this\nsubtopic. Thus, formal concepts provide a solid formalization of the notion of epistemic community (EC)\ntraditionally defined as a group of agents dealing with a common set of issues and aiming towards a common\ngoal of knowledge creation [12]. By EC, we understand henceforth a field or a subdiscipline within a given\nknowledge community together with authors working in this subdiscipline irrespective of their affiliation or\npersonal interactions, i.e., neither a department nor a research project. The concept lattice represents the\nstructure of a given knowledge community as a taxonomy of ECs, with more populated and less specific\nsubtopics closer to the top [24].\n2.3 Empirical examples and protocol\nWe focus on two databases. One of them is a bibliographical database of MedLine abstracts coming\nfrom the fast-growing community of embryologists working on the zebrafish during the period 1998\u20132003.1\nAccording to experts in the field [22, 10, 5], three major subfields are to be distinguished. First, an\nimportant part of the community focuses on biochemical signaling mechanisms, involving pathways and\nreceptors, which are crucial in understanding embryo growth processes. A second field includes comparative\nstudies: the zebrafish, as a model animal, may show similarities with other close vertebrate species, in\nparticular, with mice and humans. Finally, another significant area of interest relates to the brain and the\nnervous system, notably in association with signaling in brain development.\nFrom the bibliographical database, we build up a context describing which author used which notion\nduring the whole period, where the notion set is made of a limited dictionary of about 70 lemmatized\nwords selected by the expert [22] among the most frequent yet significant words of the community, i.e.,\nexcluding rhetorical and paradigmatic words such as \u201cis\u201d, \u201cwith\u201d, \u201cstudy\u201d, \u201cbiology\u201d, \u201cdevelop\u201d, etc. At\nfirst, we thus should say that each term appearing in an article is a notion, which is a classical assumption\nin scientometrics [21, 19]. In other words, we extract the semantics from article contents rather than from\ntheir metadata. As such, scientific fields will be defined by notion sets describing EC intents. Then, we\nextract a random sample context of 250 agents and 18 notions, which we use to illustrate the techniques\ndescribed in the paper. The concept lattice of this context consists of 1146 concepts. Taking a smaller\ndata sample (25 authors and the same 18 notions), we obtain the concept lattice shown in Fig. 1 (only\nnotion\/attribute labels are shown); it contains 69 formal concepts or epistemic communities2.\nOur second example is of similar nature. It comes from the database of all papers submitted to the\nSecond European Conference on Complex Systems in 20063. From this data, we build a context made of\nauthors and terms mentioned in article titles and abstracts. The resulting context contains 401 authors and\n109 terms, of which we have decided to keep only terms referring to topics (22 terms such as \u201cdynamics\u201d and\n\u201ctransmission\u201d) and those somehow characterizing methods used in the study of these topics (nine terms\n1Data is obtained from a query on article abstracts containing the term \u201czebrafish\u201d at http:\/\/www.pubmed.com. Using\na precise term is likely to delimit properly the community, in contrast to global terms such as \u201cmolecular biology\u201d.\n2Diagrams are produced with ConExp (http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/conexp) and ToscanaJ\n(http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/toscanaj).\n3http:\/\/complexsystems.lri.fr\/Portal\/tiki-index.php?page=ECCS\u201906\n3\nFigure 1: The concept lattice of a sample zebrafish context (with 25 authors).\nsuch as \u201cinteraction\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d).4 The concept lattice built from these terms contains 549 concepts,\nwhich is still too many for analysis and interpretation and thus calls for a more concise representation,\nwhich is the subject of the next section.\n3 Concise Representation\n3.1 Rationale\nEven if the concept lattice appears to adequately identify and organize epistemic communities, the number\nof ECs is likely to be large. Although derived from a small context, the diagram in Fig. 1 is indeed\nrather complicated. This is a well-known risk when using concept lattices. To quote [8], \u201ceven carefully\nconstructed line diagrams lose their readability from a certain size up, as a rule from around 50 elements\nup\u201d. Unfortunately, there is no hope that lattices built from real-size data will be limited to anything close\nto fifty elements.\nMoreover, some ECs are likely to be irrelevant for the purposes of deriving a practical taxonomies of\nknowledge fields. One solution is to compute only an upper part of the lattice (an order filter), e.g., concepts\ncovering at least n% of authors (in this case, we get an \u201ciceberg lattice\u201d [28]). Here, one should be careful\nnot to overlook small but interesting groups, for example, groups that represent a new research trend not\nyet supported by a large number of followers or groups that contain individuals who are not members of\n4Note that our selected topics are mostly theoretical topics and therefore do not cover specific case studies, such as \u201csocial\nsystems\u201d, even if a sizeable part of the complex system community is concerned with these notions; by topics, we mean\nvarious properties of and processes related to complex systems, rather than particular types of complex systems. Other\nnotions fall under more than one category and have thus been excluded (networks as topics, formal structures, or methods).\n4\nany other group. To take account of such groups, one should also compute all lower neighbors (proper\nsubgroups) of \u201clarge\u201d ECs (satisfying the n% threshold). Top-down lattice construction algorithms are\nparticularly suitable for this approach [16]; alternatively, one may look at algorithms designed specifically\nfor constructing iceberg lattices [28] and other algorithms from the frequent itemset mining community [3].\nThe reduction in the number of concepts can be considerable; however, though computationally feasible,\nthis would still be unsatisfying from the standpoint of manual analysis.\nClearly, the size of the concept lattice is not only a computational problem. The lattice may contain\nnodes that are just too similar to each other because of noise in data or real minor differences yet irrelevant\nto our purposes. In this case, taking an upper part of the lattice does not solve the problem, since this\npart may well contain such similar nodes. Besides, it should also be interesting to distinguish major trends\nfrom minor subfields, perhaps, with a representation allowing for different levels of precision.\nIn this section, we consider two approaches to improve the readability of line diagrams: pruning on\none side, and nesting and zooming on the other side. When pruning, we assume that some concepts\nare irrelevant: we filter out those that do not satisfy specified constraints of a certain kind. In a previous\nattempt to use concept lattices to represent EC taxonomies [24, 25], heuristics combining various criteria\u2014\nsuch as extent size, the shortest distance from the top, the number of lower neighbors, etc.\u2014were used to\nscore ECs and keep only the n best ones. The resulting pictures were meaningful taxonomies, but required\na posteriori manual analysis, while it was unclear whether it could be possible to go further than a rough\nrepresentation. Here, we focus on a particular pruning strategy based on the notion of the stability of a\nconcept [15].\nNested line diagrams [8], on the other hand, provide no reduction and, hence, do not incur any loss of\ninformation. Rather, they rearrange the concepts in such a way that the entire structure becomes more\nreadable; they provide the user with a partial view, which can then be extended to a full view if so desired.\nThus, nested line diagrams offer a useful technique for representing complex structures. Yet, because\nthey preserve all details of the lattice, in order to remove (many) irrelevant details we combine nesting\nand pruning in Sect. 3.4. We thus try to get a representation that respects the original taxonomy while\nhiding at the same time uninteresting and superfluous information; our aim is a trade-off between the noise\nlevel, the number of details, and readability. In this respect, as nested line diagrams improve readability\nbut may render the examination a more complex task, we suggest a compromise that organizes concepts\nwhile providing local diagrams for which interpretation is straightforward\u2014we call this latter approach\n\u201czooming\u201d and present it in Sect. 3.5.\n3.2 Stability-Based Pruning\nOur structures are complex, but, in fact, they are more complex than they should be, since our data is\nfairly noisy: for instance, an author might use a term accidentally (e.g., discussing related work), or there\nmay be different names for the same thing (e.g., \u201cGalois lattice\u201d and \u201cconcept lattice\u201d), in which case it\nis not obvious that people preferring one terminology should be grouped exactly under the same field as\npeople preferring another one, but, at least, there ought to be a super-field uniting them (especially since\nwe are interested in the taxonomy of knowledge fields rather than in social networks within academia). As\na result, many concepts do not correspond to real communities, and some pruning seems unavoidable.\nThe pruning technique we describe here is based on the notion of stability first introduced in [14] in\nrelation to hypotheses generated from positive and negative examples; it can be easily extended to formal\nconcepts of a context [15]. The definition we use is slightly different from the original one, but the difference\nis irrelevant to our discussion.\nDefinition 1. Let K = (G,M, I) be a formal context and (A,B) be a formal concept of K. The stability\nindex, \u03c3, of (A,B) is defined as follows:\n\u03c3(A,B) =\n|{C \u2286 A | C \u2032 = B}|\n2|A|\n. (1)\nThe stability index of a concept indicates how much the concept intent depends on particular objects\nof the extent. A stable intent is probably \u201creal\u201d even if the description of some objects is \u201cnoisy\u201d. In\napplication to our data, the stability index shows how likely we are to still observe a field if we ignore\n5\nseveral authors. Apart from noise-resistance, a stable field does not collapse (e.g., merge with a different\nfield, split into several independent subfields) when a few members stop being active or switch to another\ntopic. The following proposition describing the stability index of a concept (A,B) as a ratio between the\nnumber of subcontexts of K where B is an intent and the total number of subcontexts of K makes the idea\nbehind stability more explicit:\nProposition 1. Let K = (G,M, I) be a formal context and (A,B) be a formal concept of K. For a set\nH \u2286 G, let IH = I \u2229 (H \u00d7M) and KH = (H,M, IH). Then,\n\u03c3(A,B) =\n|{KH | H \u2286 G and B = BIHIH}|\n2|G|\n. (2)\nProof. Every C \u2286 A defines a family of contexts:\nFC(K) = {KH | C \u2286 H \u2286 G and A \u2229H = C}. (3)\nObviously, FC(K) \u2229 FD(K) = \u00d8 if C 6= D. In fact, the sets FC(K) form a partition of subcontexts of\nK (with the same attribute set M). It is easy to see that all sets FC(K) (with C \u2286 A) have the same size:\n|FC(K)| = 2|G|\u2212|A|. Note also that, for KH \u2208 FC(K), we have BIHIH = CIH = C \u2032; hence, B is closed in\nthe context KH \u2208 FC(K) if and only if C \u2032 = B. Therefore,\n|{KH | H \u2286 G and B = BIHIH}| = 2\n|G||{C \u2286 A | C \u2032 = B}|\n2|A|\n, (4)\nwhich proves the proposition.\nIn other words, the stability of a concept is the probability of preserving its intent after leaving out an\narbitrary subset of objects from the context. This is the idea of cross-validation [13] carried to its extreme:\nstable intents are those generated by a large number of subsets of the data. In the case of cross-validation,\nit is more common to consider only (some) subsets of a fixed size. Indeed, one may argue that subcontexts\nof different sizes should have different effect on the stability: the smaller the subcontext is, the further it is\nfrom the initial\u2014observed\u2014context, and, hence, the smaller should be its contribution to the instability\nof a concept. However, we leave these matters for further research and use the definition of the stability\ngiven above.\n3.2.1 Computing stability\nIn [15], it is shown that, given a formal context and one of its concepts, the problem of computing the\nstability index of this concept is #P-complete. Below, we present a simple algorithm that takes the covering\ngraph of a concept lattice B(K) and computes the stability indices for every concept of the lattice. The\nalgorithm is meant only as an illustration of a general strategy for computing the stability; therefore, we\nleave out any possible optimizations.\nAlgorithm ComputeStability\nConcepts := B(K)\nfor each (A, B) in Concepts\nCount[(A, B)] := the number of lower neighbors of (A, B)\nSubsets[(A, B)] := 2|A|\nend for\nwhile Concepts is not empty\nlet (C, D) be any concept from Concepts with Count[(C, D)] = 0\nStability[(C, D)] := Subsets[(C, D)] \/ 2|C|\nremove (C, D) from Concepts\nfor each (A, B) > (C, D)\nSubsets[(A, B)] := Subsets[(A, B)] \u2212 Subsets[(C, D)]\nif (A, B) \u001f (C, D)\nCount[(A, B)] := Count[(A, B)] \u2212 1\n6\nend if\nend for\nend while\nreturn Stability\nTo determine the stability index \u03c3(A,B), we compute the number of subsets E \u2286 A that generate the\nintersection B (i.e., for which E\u2032 = B) and store it in Subsets. The index \u03c3(A,B) is simply the number\nof such subsets divided by the number of all subsets of A, that is, by 2|A|. Once computed, \u03c3(A,B) is\nstored in Stability, which is the output of the algorithm.\nThe algorithm traverses the covering graph from the bottom concept upwards. A concept is processed\nonly after the stability indices of all its subconcepts have been computed; the Count variable is used to keep\ntrack of concepts that become eligible for processing. In the beginning of the algorithm, Count[(A, B)]\nis initialized to the number of lower neighbors of (A,B). When the stability index is computed for some\nlower neighbor of (A,B), we decrement Count[(A, B)]. By the time Count[(A, B)] reaches zero, we\nhave computed the stability indices for all lower neighbors of (A,B) and, consequently, for all subconcepts\nof (A,B). Then, it is possible to determine the stability index of (A,B).\nInitially, Subsets[(A, B)] is set to the number of all subsets of A, that is, 2|A|. Before processing\n(A,B), we process all subconcepts (C,D) of (A,B) and decrement Subsets[(A, B)] by the number of\nsubsets of C generating the intersection D. By doing so, we actually subtract from 2|A| the number of\nsubsets of A which do not generate B: indeed, every subset of A generates either B or the intent of a\nsubconcept of (A,B). Thus, the value of Subsets[(A, B)] eventually becomes equal to the number of\nsubsets of A generating B.\n3.2.2 Applying stability\nThe basic stability-based pruning method is to remove all concepts with stability below a fixed threshold.\nWe computed the stability indices for concepts of our zebrafish example (250 authors and 18 words).\nCoincidentally, the 16 most stable concepts are closed under intersection of intents. Hence, they form a\nlattice, which is shown in Fig. 2.\nFigure 2: The lattice of the 16 most stable concepts of a context built from 250 zebrafish researchers and\n18 notions they used in their papers. Here and below, attributes that are not contained in any stable\nintent other than the intent of the bottom concept are not shown on the diagram; numbers indicate the\nsizes of the corresponding extents.\nOf course, stable concepts (i.e., satisfying the chosen stability threshold) do not always form a lattice.\nThis may or may not be a problem. If all we need is a directly observable taxonomy of scientific fields,\nthere seems to be no reason to require that this taxonomy should be a lattice. In other contexts, however,\n7\na lattice may be desired in order to apply lattice-based analysis techniques. This issue is beyond the scope\nof the present paper; nonetheless, we suggest some possible strategies in Sect. 4.2.\nApart from the obvious compression\u2014we keep 16 concepts out of 1146\u2014Fig. 2 presents a readable\nepistemic taxonomy representation, displaying the major fields of the community along with some mean-\ningful joint communities (such as \u201cmouse\u201d and \u201chuman\u201d). It is interesting to note, for example, that\n\u201cpathway\u201d occurs as a subconcept of \u201csignal\u201d, which certainly makes sense from the domain point of view\n(\u201cpathway\u201d on its own is still a concept intent, but it is not sufficiently stable). Some less important\ncommunities, like \u201cmouse, conservation\u201d or \u201csignal, pathway, mouse\u201d are missing from Fig. 2. Instead,\nthe taxonomy focuses on more solid associations ignoring some particularities, which can be reintroduced\nby increasing the number of stable concepts included in the taxonomy. Alternatively, we could have a\nmulti-level representation with these communities rendered at a deeper level. Something similar applies,\ne.g., to the community \u201csignal, receptor, growth, pathway\u201d, which is missing from Fig. 2, but is interesting\naccording to the expert-based description of the field (see Sect. 2.3). In this respect, nested line diagrams\nwould appear to provide a handy representation by distinguishing various levels of importance of notions.\nThe reduced substructure corresponding to the ECCS dataset (with 401 authors and 33 words) featuring\nthe 17 most stable concepts is presented in Fig. 3. Again, note that the set of all stable concepts (for an\narbitrary threshold) does not have to be a lattice, even if it is in the examples used in this paper.\nFigure 3: The 17 most stable concepts in the ECCS dataset.\nFrom this lattice, it is possible to provide the following description of the community who attended the\nECCS in 2006:\n\u2022 Most notions present at the top-level should be typical of major issues in the community: \u201cdynam-\nics\u201d, \u201ccommunity\u201d and \u201cstructure\u201d, \u201calgorithm\u201d, \u201cemergence\u201d, and \u201cinteraction\u201d. In particular,\ninteractions, which are often modeled within networks, are as such a central methodological tool for\ncomplex systems.\n\u2022 Besides, ECs focused on the dynamics of complex systems are strongly structuring the field, as they\nform many subcommunities with other ECs, at various levels; including for instance \u201cdynamics,\nemergence\u201d and \u201cdynamics, interaction\u201d.\n\u2022 More specifically, \u201cinteraction\u201d as a method is often used jointly with \u201cdynamics\u201d and \u201cstructure\u201d,\n8\nsuggesting a particular interest in the structural evolution of networks and interactions. Additionally,\n\u201cevolutionary\u201d as a methodological viewpoint is mostly involved in the studies of \u201cdynamics\u201d.\n\u2022 There is no method that is specific or prevailing in the topic of \u201ccontrol\u201d\u2014i.e., the control of systems\nand optimization of their behavior towards some task.\n\u2022 On the other hand, algorithmic methods and experimental techniques do not seem to be specific to\nany topic, and \u201calgorithm\u201d and \u201cexperimental\u201d thus make isolated ECs in this lattice.\n3.3 Nested Line Diagrams\nNested line diagrams are a well-established tool in formal concept analysis that makes it possible to\ndistribute representation details across several levels [8]. The main idea is to divide the attribute set of the\ncontext into two (or more) parts, construct the concept lattices for the generated subcontexts, and draw\nthe diagram of one lattice inside each node of the other lattice. In the case of two parts, an inner concept\n(A,B) enclosed within an outer concept (C,D) corresponds to a pair (A\u2229C,B\u222aD). Not every such pair is\na concept of the original context. Only inner nodes that correspond to concepts are represented by circles;\nsuch nodes are said to be \u201crealized\u201d. The outer diagram structures the data along one attribute subset,\nwhile the diagram inside an outer concept describes its structure in terms of the remaining attributes. For\nmore details, see [8].\nThe first step in constructing a nested line diagram is to split the attribute set into several parts.\nThese parts do not have to be disjoint, but they will be in our case; hence, we are looking for a partition\nof the attribute set. As we seek to improve readability, we should display foremost the most significant\nattributes; therefore, we should assign major notions to higher levels, while leaving minor distinctions for\nlower levels. To this end, the words should be partitioned according to a \u201cpreference function\u201d, which\ncould range from the simplest (e.g., word frequency within the corpus) to more complicated designs.\nOne could consider a minimal set of notions covering all authors, i.e., find an irredundant cover set, as\nwords from such a set could be expected to play a key role in describing the community (even if this set\nis, of course, not unique in general). This is what we have done in [26], where we used the algorithm from\n[2] to compute such a cover set for the small zebrafish context (with 25 authors), whose concept lattice is\nshown in Fig. 1. We apply it iteratively: the first subcontext contains notions forming an irredundant cover\nset for the whole author set; the second subcontext includes notions not occurring in the first subcontext,\nwhile covering the set of authors excluding those that use only notions from the first subcontext, etc. The\nlast level contains the remaining notions. For more details and the resulting structures see [26].\nIn this paper, we focus on the ECCS data. To partition attributes, we divide the set of terms into\nseveral groups depending on their meaning. We identify two groups of terms: those referring to topics and\nthose referring to methods. In nesting, we can draw the line diagram of methods inside the line diagram of\ntopics to see which methods are used for which topics. Yet, while nesting makes it possible to distinguish\nbetween various levels of precision, both the outer and inner diagrams are still too large (240 nodes for\ntopics and 53 nodes for methods). Stability-based pruning will address this problem; combining both\nprocedures should yield a concise hierarchical representation.\n3.4 Combining Nesting and Stability-Based Pruning\nAfter partitioning the set of words and building lattices for individual parts, we prune each lattice using\nthe stability criterion. We can use different thresholds for different parts depending on the number of\nconcepts we are comfortable to work with. For our ECCS example, we get the two diagrams shown in Fig.\n4. Many attributes are not shown in the picture, as they are not contained in any stable intent but the\nbottom ones.\nWe proceed by drawing one diagram inside the other and interpret the picture as usual. Again, only\n\u201crealized\u201d inner nodes, i.e., those corresponding to concepts of the full context are represented by circles.\nFigure 5 shows the resulting structure for our context.\nThis approach may also help in reducing the computational complexity. Generally, computing inner\nconcepts is the same as computing the lattice for the whole context, but, combining pruning and nesting,\nwe compute inner nodes only for relevant (that is, non-pruned) outer nodes.\n9\nFigure 4: The pruned lattices of ECCS topics and methods.\nFigure 5: Nested line diagram of pruned lattices from Fig. 4\n10\nLet us denote by Bp(K) the set of concepts of K satisfying the chosen pruning criteria and ordered in\nthe usual way (one may regard p as an indicator of a specific pruning strategy). Assume that contexts\nK1 = (G,M1, I1) and K2 = (G,M2, I2) are subcontexts of K = (G,M, I) such that M = M1 \u222aM2 and\nI = I1 \u222a I2. We define the set of concepts corresponding to nodes of the nested line diagram of the pruned\nconcept sets Bp(K1) and Bp(K2):\nBp(G,M1,M2, I) = {(A,B) \u2208 B(K) | \u2200i \u2208 {1, 2} : ((B \u2229Mi)\u2032, B \u2229Mi) \u2208 Bp(Ki)}.\nProposition 2. If Bp(K1) and Bp(K2) are\n\u2228\n-subsemilattices of B(K1) and B(K2), respectively, then\nBp(G,M1,M2, I) is a\n\u2228\n-subsemilattice of B(K) and the map\n(A,B) 7\u2192 (((B \u2229M1)\u2032, B \u2229M1), ((B \u2229M2)\u2032, B \u2229M2)) (5)\nis a\n\u2228\n-preserving order embedding of Bp(G,M1,M2, I) in the direct product of Bp(K1) and Bp(K2).\nProof. Let (A,B), (C,D) \u2208 Bp(G,M1,M2, I). Then, we have (A,B) \u2228 (C,D) = ((B \u2229 D)\u2032, B \u2229 D) \u2208\nBp(G,M1,M2, I), since B\u2229D\u2229Mi = (B\u2229Mi)\u2229(D\u2229Mi) is the intent of a concept in Bp(Ki) for i \u2208 {1, 2}.\nHence, Bp(G,M1,M2, I) is indeed a\n\u2228\n-subsemilattice of B(K). To see that the above-mentioned mapping\nis\n\u2228\n-preserving, note that it maps the intent B \u2229D to the pair of intents (B \u2229D \u2229M1, B \u2229D \u2229M2), and\nB \u2229D \u2229Mi is the intent of the join of concepts with intents B \u2229Mi and D \u2229Mi for i \u2208 {1, 2}.\nUnlike in standard nesting [8], the component maps (A,B) 7\u2192 ((B \u2229Mi)\u2032, B \u2229Mi) are not necessarily\nsurjective on B(Ki). Hence, some outer nodes in our nested line diagram may be empty, i.e., contain no\nrealized inner nodes, and some nodes of the inner diagram may never be realized.\nBack to our example, the pruned outer diagram on Fig. 5 embraces most major topics, while the sta-\nbilized inner diagram covers most major methods, as detailed above in Sect. 3.2.2. We can thus discern\n\u201ccommunity\u201d, \u201cstructure\u201d and \u201cdynamics\u201d which altogether form pairs of joint communities, while \u201ccon-\ntrol\u201d and \u201cemergence\u201d are also present as main issues: \u201cemergence\u201d, in particular, is a single-topic EC, and\nit also and makes a joint community with \u201cdynamics\u201d. Looking at realized nodes in inner diagrams, we\nnotice that \u201cinteraction\u201d and \u201calgorithm\u201d are everywhere, and this plausibly indicates a very strong core\nof methods for complex systems topics. However, on the whole, most nodes are actually realized, which is\nunsurprising given that we selected major methods, likely to be realized for all major topics. In this respect,\nstudying non-realized nodes may yield some more precise insight: for example, apart from \u201cinteraction\u201d,\n\u201calgorithm\u201d, and \u201cexperimental\u201d no node is realized in the \u201ccontrol\u201d and \u201ccommunity, structure\u201d nodes,\nwhile a lack of white nodes in ECs related to dynamics of communities seems to indicate that more diverse\nmethods are used in relation to these topics than in studying other issues related to communities. One\ncan also notice that \u201cphysical\u201d and \u201cevolutionary\u201d nodes are unrealized in the outer \u201ccommunity\u201d node,\nbut become realized in its child \u201cdynamics, community\u201d node. This indicates implications in the data:\n\u201ccommunity, physical\u201d \u2192 \u201cdynamics\u201d and \u201ccommunity, evolutionary\u201d \u2192 \u201cdynamics\u201d, suggesting that\nphysical and evolutionary approaches to the study of communities are applied exclusively\u2014or, given pos-\nsible noise in our data, mostly\u2014in the studies of community dynamics. The same inner nodes\u2014\u201cphysical\u201d\nand \u201cevolutionary\u201d\u2014are unrealized for \u201ccontrol\u201d, but, then, the \u201ccontrol\u201d node has no descendants in\nthe \u201cstabilized\u201d outer lattice. Thus, even if physical or evolutionary approaches might be common in the\nstudy of some subtopics of \u201ccontrol\u201d, these subtopics are not relevant to the general description of the\nECCS community at the chosen level of detail.\nYet, even with these finer distinctions, it remains substantially hard to distinguish which are the most\nimportant methods for each topic; in this regard, it might be preferable to have a proper subdiagram for\neach outer node, i.e., zoom on each topic to get its proper structure.\n3.5 Zooming\nNested line diagrams allow one to uncover connections between inner nodes located in different outer\nnodes (see the discussion on implications above). The drawback of this representation is that pruning is\npossible only on the global level: in the case of Fig. 5, we select major combinations of topics and major\ncombinations of methods and then use nesting to show which major methods are used in which major\ntopics. However, different methods are used in studying different topics, and some methods that are not\n11\nFigure 6: Zoomed lattices for \u201ccommunity\u201d (left), \u201ccommunity, structure\u201d (middle), and \u201ccommunity,\ndynamics\u201d (right).\nthat important \u201cglobally\u201d (and hence missing from our pruned diagram) might be essential in studying\na particular topic. Therefore, it would be better in some cases to prune each \u201cinner\u201d lattice individually.\nWith this approach, we will not be able to directly see the links between method combinations across\ndifferent topics, but we will have a more adequate representation of methods used for each topic.\nWe call this approach \u201czooming\u201d. The idea is simple: by zooming into a concept (C,D) from the lattice\nof topics, we mean the construction of the lattice of the subcontext of methods formed by restricting the\nset of objects to C (and, of course, by restricting the set of attributes to those referring to methods).\nZoomed lattices reveal differences between topics in a much clearer and more sensible manner than\nwould be by interpreting inner nodes of a nested line diagram: significant methods are described in\nthe zoomed lattice of each topic without requiring a comparison with the rest of the structure in order to\nunderstand which methods are indeed present or not, major or minor. Applying this to our ECCS example,\nwe consider a selection of a few topics from the lattice of topics (see Fig. 4) and show the corresponding\nzoomed lattices of methods in Figs. 6 and 7. For each topic, we use various stability thresholds such that\nlattice sizes remain in the same range of 6-8 nodes, while including all nodes with the same stability index.\nIt is subsequently straightforward to choose various levels of detail for each diagram rather than work with\nthe same lattice for all topics. Besides, whereas having more nodes would obviously have provided more\ndetails, it would however have been at the cost of including nodes whose significance might have been\nquestionable\u2014such as nodes covering fewer than 5 agents, for instance.\nOur set includes nodes corresponding to \u201ccommunity\u201d-related topics which appear to be very similar\nto each other, at various scales, indicating that the main methods in use in these subfields are consistent\nacross subtopics. Most interestingly, zoomed lattices for \u201ccommunity\u201d and \u201ccommunity, structure\u201d are\nstrictly identical, with the exception of population figures (see Fig. 6), while \u201ccommunity, dynamics\u201d\ndiffers only slightly by the fact that \u201cphysical\u201d replaces \u201cexperiment\u201d as a method and is jointly linked to\n\u201ctransition phase, interaction\u201d\u2014this suggests that notions from statistical physics are more prominent in\nthe dynamical study of communities, with less empiricism.\nTo the contrary, zoomed nodes for \u201cdynamics\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d are significantly different from each other\nand from the \u201ccommunity\u201d-related lattices: the subtopic \u201cdynamics\u201d indeed has a rather flat zoomed\nlattice, where all methods seem to hold equal positions, although their populations range from 17 agents\nfor \u201cdeterministic\u201d to 49 for \u201cinteraction\u201d. This confirms the previous observation that dynamics are a\nstrongly structuring topic for complex systems spanning almost all major methodological notions. On the\nother hand, the zoomed lattice for \u201ccontrol\u201d exhibits a more hierarchical structure where \u201cexperimental\u201d\nand \u201cinteraction\u201d appear as major methods, possibly representative of the relationships of these studies\nwith empirical approaches and network design problems\u2014\u201cevolutionary\u201d and \u201calgorithm\u201d are somewhat\nless important, possibly related to optimization methods per se. Note that \u201ccontrol, evolutionary\u201d, indis-\ntinguishable in the \u201cglobal\u201d nested line diagram, becomes visible when we zoom into \u201ccontrol\u201d. Finally,\nthe fact that \u201calgorithm\u201d is described as a submethod of \u201cexperimental\u201d could emphasize how helpful\nalgorithms are in implementing and experimenting normative control prescriptions.\n12\nFigure 7: Zoomed lattices for \u201cdynamics\u201d (left) and \u201ccontrol\u201d (right).\n4 Further Work\n4.1 Variants of Stability\nThe stability index \u03c3 as in Definition 1 and [15] refers to the stability of an intent; we may call it intensional.\nThe extensional stability index of a concept (A,B) can be defined similarly:\n\u03c3e(A,B) =\n|{D \u2286 B | D\u2032 = A}|\n2|B|\n. (6)\nThe extensional stability of a concept is the probability of preserving its extent after leaving out an\narbitrary subset of attributes from the context. A proposition similar to Proposition 1 holds. Extensional\nstability relates to the social aspect of the concept, measuring how much the community as a group of\npeople depends on a particular topic. It may also be useful for fighting noisy words: a community based on\na noisy word (or, e.g., a homograph used differently within different communities) is likely be extensionally\nunstable.\nProposition 1 suggests how the general stability index of a concept (A,B) should be defined\u2014as the\nratio between the number of subcontexts of K = (G,M, I) preserving the concept up to the omitted objects\nand attributes and the total number of subcontexts, or, more formally:\n|{(H,N, J) | H \u2286 G,N \u2286M,J = I \u2229 (H \u00d7N), AJH = BN , BJN = AH}|\n2|G|+|M |\n(7)\nwhere AH = A\u2229H and BN = B \u2229N . As of now, we are not aware of any realistic method for computing\nthis general stability; thus, it seems to be mainly of theoretical interest.\nOn the other hand, limited versions of stability (e.g., computed over subsets of a certain size only), as\nwell as various combinations of extensional and intensional stability, are worth trying.\n4.2 Strategies for Pruning\nOther techniques aiming at reducing the number of concepts should be tested and, perhaps, some of them\ncan be combined with stability for better results\u2014notably pruning based on monotonous criteria like\nextent\/intent size. Another method is given by attribute-dependency formulas [4], involving an expert-\nspecified hierarchy on the attribute set (e.g., \u201chuman\u201d and \u201cmouse\u201d are subtypes of \u201cvertebrate\u201d).\nAs noticed in Sect. 3.2.2, pruning may not necessarily yield a lattice. We can handle this situation\nin several ways: for example, enlarging the resulting structure by including all intersections of stable\nintents or reducing it by eliminating some stable intents. Regarding the latter option, we may prefer to\nmerge an unstable concept (A,B) with its subconcept (C,D) rather than simply drop (A,B). It is not\nimmediately clear how to choose (C,D)\u2014only that it should be somehow close to (A,B). Merging can be\ndone by assuming that all objects from A have all attributes from D and replacing the context relation I\n13\nby I \u222a A\u00d7D (cf. [23]). However, the modified context may have intents that are absent from the initial\ncontext, which is probably undesirable. Alternatively, one could add B \u2192 D to the implication system\nof the context. The lattice of attribute subsets generated by this augmented implication system will be\ndifferent from the original lattice only in that B and possibly some of its previously closed supersets are\nnot in the new lattice.\nA different approach would involve merging based on partial implications (or association rules): com-\npute all partial implications for the given confidence threshold and add them to the implication system of\nthe context. It is a matter of further experiments to see which strategies are suitable for our goals.\n4.3 Nesting and zooming\nNested line and zoomed diagrams are not limited to two levels, although it still has to be investigated\nwhether multi-level diagrams remain readable and interpretable. Various techniques for partitioning at-\ntribute sets should be explored. One strategy specific to our application is to partition words according to\ntheir type: as a verb, noun, adjective; or as a method, object, property, etc., which is what we have done\nfor the ECCS data in this paper. Such a method can be combined with other feature selection algorithms.\nIt should be noted that nesting and zooming seem to have more potential if used in interactive software\ntools that allow the user to zoom in and out on particular communities instead of having to deal with\nthe entire picture. Such a tool could even allow the user to interchange between nesting and zooming,\nsince these two representations should be seen as complementary. The fact that one need not compute\neverything at once provides an additional computational advantage.\n4.4 Dynamic Monitoring\nModeling changes of the community structure should be particularly useful to describe the evolution of\nfields historically, either longitudinally or dynamically. The longitudinal approach means establishing a\nrelation between community structures corresponding to different time points, e.g., identifying cases when\nseveral communities have merged into one or a community has divided into several sub-communities. FCA\noffers some methods for comparing two lattices built from identical objects and\/or attributes (e.g., see\n[30]). Yet the relevance of such methods is likely to be application-dependent, and they should certainly\nbe adapted for the reduced lattice-based structures we work with. One possibility in line with the static\napproach is to use nested line diagrams by nesting diagrams of contexts corresponding to successive time\npoints. It will also be worth exploring what temporal concept analysis [31] has to offer in this regard.\nA more ambitious dynamic approach to modeling changes assumes that any elementary change in the\ndatabase (any modification of G, M , or I: a new author, a new word, an author using a particular word for\nthe first time, or removal of authors due to their inactivity, etc.) should correspond to a concrete change in\nthe representation of communities. Although not every such change will have effect on the structure of the\ncommunities, it should always be possible to trace a change in the structure to a sequence of elementary\nchanges in the database.\n5 Conclusion\nThe approach discussed in this paper is based on the assumption that community structure in knowledge-\nbased social networks should be dealt with more deeply than by simply relying on single-mode character-\nizations, as is often the case. In previous work [24, 25], it was shown how concept lattices can be used to\nbuild knowledge taxonomies from data describing authors by sets of terms they use in their papers. As\nfrequently happens with concept lattices derived from real data, such taxonomies tend to be huge and,\ntherefore, hard to compute and analyze. The computational complexity can be partially addressed by\nreducing the number of agents, since a taxonomy centered on knowledge fields rather than individuals\njustifies the use of a random representative sample of authors.\nHowever, the interpretability of results requires a more serious effort. In this paper, we proposed a\npruning method based on the stability indices of formal concepts [15]. We think that this method does\nnot simply reduce the concept lattice to a somewhat rougher structure, but also helps to combat noise in\n14\ndata, so that the resulting structure might even be more accurate in describing the knowledge community\nthan the original lattice is.\nWe suggested that this method could also be applied to constituent parts of a nested line diagram or\nof a zoomed diagram in order to achieve an optimal relationship between the readability of the taxonomy\nand the level of detail in it. This is beneficial from the viewpoint of computational complexity, too: it\nis easier to compute the lattices of subcontexts used in nesting or zooming and then prune each of them\nindividually than to compute the lattice of the entire context and prune it. Besides, such diagrams admit\n\u201clazy\u201d computation: if nesting or zooming is implemented within an interactive software tool, the user\nshould be allowed to choose which outer nodes to explore; if the user is not interested in some outer nodes,\nthe corresponding inner diagrams will never be computed.\nWe have illustrated the proposed techniques with a few examples. Of course, wider experiments are\nneeded to see how this works. There are quite a few open questions: how to efficiently compute stability,\nhow exactly stability-based criteria should be formulated and applied (e.g., dropping unstable nodes vs.\nmerging them with stable nodes), what other compression techniques exist and how they perform against\nstability-based pruning, etc. Also, better linguistic processing is certainly need at the stage when a context\nis constructed from a database: smart methods to identify notions would be able to deal with homonyms\nand synonyms, take into account the context and domains-specific associations between words. We have\nsummarized some of the possible research directions in Sect. 4. Thus, this paper is only a step towards a\nconsistent methodology for creating concise knowledge taxonomies based on concept lattices.\nReferences\n[1] Scott Atran.
