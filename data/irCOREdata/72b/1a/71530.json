Analysis of responsibility for past actions is often traced back to Aristotle, \ninviting us to suppose that the concept of responsibility is relatively timeless. A related \nstrand of philosophical discussion dwells on what it is to be responsible, in the sense of \nbeing a moral agent. Again, such discussion tends to assume that the concept of \nresponsibility does not need to be situated historically.1 \nIt may be surprising, then, to note that the word \u2018responsibility\u2019 is rather modern. The \nEnglish noun dates back to the end of the eighteenth century, so too its analogues in \nother European languages. Although the adjective has a longer history, it is only in the \nnineteenth century that the concept is drawn into philosophical controversies.2 Our \nphilosophical discussions pose a puzzle, then. If the cluster of concepts associated with \nresponsibility is as timeless as philosophers usually assume, why should a new word \nhave been coined, and gained such currency? I would like to propose that this puzzle \ncan be answered if we turn to a common use of \u2018responsibility\u2019 that philosophers have \n                                                 \n1  Major discussions that combine these approaches include Wallace 1994 and Fischer and Ravizza \n1998. An interesting exception to such non-historicist approaches is Williams 1985, for whom blame \nforms one element of a distinctively modern \u2018morality system.\u2019 \n2  A detailed account is given by McKeon 1957, pp. 6ff. As McKeon acknowledges, however, the \nadjective may be traced back rather further \u2013 as early as the thirteenth century in French, and in \nmedieval (legal) Latin in the following century (cf Bovens 1998, p. 23n2). Hobbes, for example, asks \nwhether a member of an assembly may be responsible for its debts or crimes (1651, ch. 22, \u00a7\u00a713, \n15); and John Locke speaks of potential borrowers as \u2018honest and responsible (1691, pp. 234, 286). \nResponsibility as a virtue \n3 \ntended to ignore: responsibility as a moral virtue, for which we praise some people and \norganisations, while we criticise others for its lack. \nMy concern in this paper, however, goes deeper than this linguistic coinage, and beyond \nthe connections between responsibility as a virtue and other uses of the term more \nfamiliar in philosophical discussion. This paper is written in the belief that \nresponsibility is one of the central virtues of modern liberal societies. It is a virtue that \nwe demand of both people and organisations \u2013 speaking of socially responsible \ncorporations, managerial responsibility, individual responsibility and so forth. What is \nit, then, about our mode of social and political organisation that has made the demand \nfor responsibility so ubiquitous and, as I will also argue, so inescapable? \nThis is to pose a vast question: my reply is necessarily exploratory, especially because \nphilosophical accounts of liberalism and modernity give no particular prominence to \nresponsibility. Rather than turning to existing theories, therefore, I invoke features of \nmodern liberal societies that are concrete, practical realities for all or most of their \nmembers. Nonetheless, I will suggest that two quite abstract points readily follow from \nthese. First, responsibility is a virtue of a social order that is pervasively \ninstitutionalised, in a peculiarly self-reflexive manner. Second, this institutional fabric is \nthe condition of our exercising responsibility as well as the reason for the virtue\u2019s \nimportance. I have argued elsewhere that liberal political theory tends to give \ninsufficient weight to the institutional character of actual liberal societies (Williams, \n2006). Here, by contrast, I pursue a moral claim: that we, the members of these \nsocieties, are right to give such pride of place to this virtue.  \nThe paper proceeds as follows. First, I briefly examine the historical emergence of \nresponsibility, and note that this does not explain the non-political character of most \ncontemporary demands for the virtue. Second, I turn to the everyday meaning of \nresponsibility, and offer a schematic account of what is involved in this virtue. I stress, \nin particular, that it involves responding to a whole host of normative demands, within a \nfield of mutual accountability. However, as the next section points out, this poses a \npuzzle, in that so many factors work against normative consensus in modern societies \nand against normative unity in the lives of their members. In the fourth section, \ntherefore, I seek to persuade the reader that we must turn to the institutional character of \nResponsibility as a virtue \n4 \nmodern societies to explain the possibility of responsibility; and in the final section, that \nthis institutional fabric also renders the virtue of urgent importance to us. In a nutshell: \nResponsibility is made possible by the successes of liberalism\u2019s institutional order; it is \nnecessary both to sustain this order and to address its inevitable failures in achieving all \nthat we demand of it. \nI The emergence of responsibility \nAs indicated, philosophers tend to speak of responsibility as a property of all rational \nagents (\u2018responsible agency\u2019), or as a matter of holding people accountable for past \nactions (sometimes termed \u2018retrospective responsibility\u2019). But there is another use, \nwhereby we praise some people, and not others, as responsible. We also commend some \ncollective agents, such as institutions, as responsible \u2013 thus one of the original uses of \nthe adjective: \u2018responsible government.\u2019 In this paper I shall refer most often to the \nindividual case, but also want to keep the collective usage in mind, since it turns out to \nbe rather important for our topic. Accordingly, I shall often use the term \u2018agent,\u2019 to refer \nto both individual persons and collective bodies. \nThe word \u2018responsibility\u2019 has a relatively short history. Its most important original use \nwas in political thought and debate, for instance in the Federalist Papers (1787) and \nEdmund Burke (1796).3 Here, responsibility pertains to those who govern or to \ngovernment itself. The Victorians invented and popularised the notion of \u2018personal \nresponsibility,\u2019 a term also taken up in modern Christian ethics, where our personal \nresponsibility before God has been much emphasised. Only in the twentieth century, \nhowever, has responsibility become a widely noticed and widely articulated demand. \nWhat significance should we attach to the newness of the word, and the fact that the \nvirtue it represents has so quickly become important in so many spheres of our lives? \n                                                 \n3  Here I am relying on the citations of the Oxford English Dictionary and McKeon 1957, pp. 23ff. As \nnoted, the adjective does have a longer history. \nResponsibility as a virtue \n5 \nThere are two plausible directions one might follow, when confronting the prominence \nof responsibility in modern life. On the one hand, one might suppose that the virtue it \nnames is unlikely to be new.4 There are good reasons for thinking that the values we \nassociate with responsibility (reliability, judgment, initiative \u2013 more on these in a \nmoment) have always been important. What is new, on this line of thinking, is its \ndiscursive importance: and the most obvious construction to place on this is that we can \nno longer take responsibility for granted \u2013 that we now have special reasons to notice its \nabsence, or compelling practical grounds to demand its exercise. On this view, we might \nsuppose that the circumstances of responsibility are enduring, though somehow \nsharpened by our contemporary situation. \nAlternatively, one might opt for a more thorough-going historicism about responsibility. \nOne might argue that our modern emphasis on choice, or our peculiar reflexivity toward \nall values, institutions and authorities, create distinctive forms of agency. This has \nrefashioned us as subjects (as Foucault had it), and created distinctively modern types of \ncollective agency. As well as suggesting that responsibility has a special connection \nwith modern conditions, it would imply that attributing it to agents in pre-modern \nconditions (or criticising their lack of it) is anachronistic. Such a thesis raises far-\nreaching questions about the social construction of agents and actions, which are bound \nto be controversial.5 \nHere, therefore, I restrict my claims to terms compatible with the first view. I will not \nclaim that responsibility has not been exercised in former historical periods or in social \nand political settings radically different from our own. Nonetheless, I think we must \ntake seriously the historical appearance of the concept, and especially its obvious \nsignificance to modern societies. The question is how we should explain the former, and \nwhether the latter may be justified. To approach the historical question, I turn briefly to \nthe philosopher who has said most about the history of responsibility, Richard McKeon. \n                                                 \n4  Evidently, just the lack of a word to name a moral value is not enough to justify a strongly historicist \nposition. Aristotle, for example, spoke of several virtues that lacked a name in his language. \n5  At least so far as individual agency is concerned: it is, I take it, rather easier to see that new forms of \ncollective agency might emerge. \nResponsibility as a virtue \n6 \nMcKeon was also much taken with the newness of \u2018responsibility.\u2019 He argued that \npolitical theorists (not least John Stuart Mill) originally turned to the concept to avoid \ndisputes about \u2018freedom of the will\u2019 and moral motivation, and to deal with issues of \ngreater immediate importance, such as legal and representative accountability. This led \nto an \u2018enlarged concept of responsibility\u2019 that provides \u2018a way to discuss moral \nproblems of individual action, political problems of common action, and cultural \nproblems of mutual understanding, without commitment to a single philosophy or to the \nexpression of values traditional in a single culture\u2019 (1957: 29f). Thus McKeon \nemphasises the secular character of responsibility: despite the resonance it also found in \nChristian ethics, it arose in political contexts of mutual accountability and continues to \nfunction in the absence of a single scheme of values. Theoretically speaking, \nresponsibility takes us away from \u2018moral metaphysics,\u2019 toward problems \u2018found in the \ncircumstances and history in which the concept itself was formed\u2019 (1957: 32).6 \nAlthough this suggestion has not been influential in subsequent philosophical \ndiscussion, where questions of moral metaphysics continue to preoccupy, it does not \nseem unreasonable in itself. For my purposes, the difficulty is that McKeon connects the \nconcept closely with political responsibility and the concerns of political theory. This \nseems to correspond to important historical usages of the word, its use by Hamilton or \nBurke, then by Mill or, later again, Max Weber. But why has the term become such an \neveryday concern? If we start with the political uses, one might speculate that this is \nrelated to the emergence of universal suffrage. Yet we most often use the term without \nparticular reference to citizenship and its duties. What we lack, then,7 is an account of \nwhy this term has gained such widespread currency \u2013 to the point where responsibility \n                                                 \n6  Or at least it should: part of McKeon\u2019s argument is that we do badly to think of responsibility in \nterms of the problem of free will. In any case, the question of whether adults of sound mind are \nresponsible by virtue of, say, free will does not help with the question of how some better exemplify \nresponsibility than others, nor with how collective bodies might manifest responsibility. \n7  I need to make one central exception, a figure who will be unheard of by most readers. Geoffrey \nVickers anticipates much of my argument, being an acute observer of \u2018two familiar but staggering \nchanges of the last hundred years. One is the escalation of our expectations; the other is the escalation \nof our institutions\u2019 (1973, p. 11). \nResponsibility as a virtue \n7 \nhas become something that we continually demand of each other, and of the \norganisations amongst which we live. \nII What does \u2018responsibility\u2019 involve? \nIf we turn to contemporary usage, many connotations of \u2018responsibility\u2019 are clear, even \nif it is not immediately obvious how they fit together. There is an element of reliability \nand commitment, of carrying on with something over time. There is a dimension of \ninitiative or judgment: the agent can be trusted with something and to exercise some \ndegree of discretion. There is an obvious point of connection between the virtue and \nretrospective responsibility, in terms of mutual accountability. This involves a readiness \nto identify with and answer for past actions or omissions, and to make up for these \nwhere they have proved faulty. In each case, we tend to have a particular \u2018sphere of \nresponsibility\u2019 in mind. This certainly includes an agent\u2019s previous actions but is \ntypically more forward-looking, to some particular area of care and concern.8 This \npoints to yet another use of the word: we sometimes use \u2018responsibility\u2019 as a synonym \nfor obligation. Clearly, the virtue is closely related to conscientiousness in fulfilling \none\u2019s responsibilities. With some circularity, one might say that responsibility suggests \nan agent who lives up to her, or its, position within a division of responsibilities and \nwithin relations of mutual accountability. \nGiven this complexity, there are many ways in which one might attempt to define the \nvirtue. According to Max Weber\u2019s well-known ethic of responsibility a person (above \nall, the political actor) \u2018must bear the (foreseeable) consequences of his actions,\u2019 which \nrequires that he be able to face realities \u2018with inner composure and calm\u2019 (1919: 441, \n436).9 The Oxford English Dictionary defines \u2018responsible\u2019 as \u2018capable of fulfilling an \n                                                 \n8  Thus we may praise someone as responsible in two ways. We may say she is responsible per se. Or \nwe might describe how well she performs a particular role \u2013 eg, \u2018the responsible mother\u2019 \u2013 and thus \nrefer to a particular sphere of responsibilities. \n9  My translation. Weber writes, of course, in terms of Verantwortung and its cognates. In some \ncontexts, as a referee for this journal has argued, this might be translated as \u2018accountability.\u2019 I retain \nResponsibility as a virtue \n8 \nobligation or trust; reliable, trustworthy\u2026\u2019 Herbert Fingarette writes, \u2018Responsibility \nemerges where the individual accepts as a matter of personal concern something which \nsociety offers to his concern\u2019 (1967: 6). Clearly, each of these definitions captures \nsomething important about the virtue. For the purpose of understanding its significance \nto modern liberal societies, however, I propose to look at it in more schematic terms. \nThe formula I would like to offer is this: responsibility represents the readiness to \nrespond to a plurality of normative demands. These terms will not be of much \nassistance in judging whether any particular agent has manifested the virtue, as I will \ndiscuss in a moment. My claim, however, is that they will help us to see how and why \nthe virtue has become so important to modern societies. \nThe chief point I would like to highlight consists in the connection between \nresponsibility and plurality \u2013 that is, the many different normative demands \n(\u2018responsibilities,\u2019 as well as other requirements and desiderata) that weigh upon us. My \nbasic reason for emphasising plurality is straightforward: in paradigmatic cases where \nthe virtue of responsibility is demanded the situation involves plural demands. For \nexamples: the professional trying to do his best amid various regulations and \nprofessional codes, short-term priorities and longer-term goals; or the anxious parent, \ntrying to balance her child\u2019s security with concern for its growing independence, \njuggling those concerns alongside duties in her workplace. Depending on the situation, \nthere may or may not be serious conflict between these demands. But in every case, \nthere remains a need to chart a course of action that will constitute as adequate a \nresponse to them as may be possible.  \nEven as I say this, a straightforward objection may suggest itself. There are plainly \nsimple cases of irresponsibility where an agent fails in a single basic duty, perhaps from \nsheer selfishness or utter thoughtlessness. (The babysitter who gets too drunk to take \nproper care of a child, the driver who omits a needed rest-stop.) I believe that we should \nregard such cases as derivative \u2013 that is, although they can be described in the language \n                                                                                                                                               \nthe conventional translation because Weber\u2019s general concern is with the qualities of character \ndemanded of the politician \u2013 above all, a sense of responsibility. \nResponsibility as a virtue \n9 \nof responsibility, they represent a simplified usage that omits one of the concept\u2019s most \ncentral features. Why else, then, should we treat plurality as central to responsibility? \nIn the first place, it is difficult to make sense of the intimate connection between \nresponsibility and judgment and initiative if we do not emphasise plurality in demands. \nIf we were simply faced with single duties at succeeding points in time, responsibility \nwould be literally too easy for words. The obedient and dutiful child is not yet \nresponsible, at least not until she starts to exercise her own judgment; the well-trained \nanimal never will be responsible. Compared with the agency of children or animals, two \ndistinctive features of adult human agency (and of certain forms of collective agency) \nare crucial: first, the capacity to move between different frames of reference; second, to \nrespond for past actions and plan future interventions. Moving between different \nsituations, and moving through changing situations: both involve negotiating multiple \nnormative demands. When we praise an agent as responsible we are describing a \nreadiness to exercise judgment and initiative with regard to the (changing, variable, \nnever entirely foreseeable) demands she encounters over time. \nA second basis for this plurality lies in the conflicting perspectives that recur in \nnormative judgment. Even in quite simple cases the agent and those around him may \ndiffer or be uncertain about each party\u2019s various expectations, priorities, duties, and so \nforth. There will thus be diversity of opinion and even conflict as to what should be \ndone by whom \u2013 the more so, as we recall the extended timeframe that each negotiates, \nand the different fields of activity that each must traverse. (Again, the connection with \nretrospective responsibility is clear, as others hold us accountable for past actions. So \ntoo the connection to responsibility as a synonym for duty \u2013 only that ideas about our \nduties tend to be so multifarious.) Conflicting demands and conflicting interpretations \nof those demands are the basic stuff of situations where we care about responsibility. \nThis poses inescapable problems for practical judgment. The responsible agent must \nnegotiate particular, diverse and sometimes conflicting claims. Being concerned to \nreconcile these demands, she cannot treat all of them uncritically. It is not only that \ntaking claims at face value (that is, as validly construed by those who place them, \nincluding oneself) would be a recipe for thoughtlessness. Even more important, in \ncomplex, on-going situations the claims upon us are never straightforwardly \nResponsibility as a virtue \n10 \nreconcilable. This means that we cannot take them at face value \u2013 except at the price of \nforgetting or ignoring some of those claims. Rather than sheer selfishness or utter \nthoughtlessness, then, I am suggesting that the most consequential form of \nirresponsibility consists in simplifying matters by ignoring some normative demands.10 \nWe ask that the claims of the self, the claims of others, the claims of the situation all be \nresponded to. Judgment and initiative, imagination and commitment are our resources \nfor discerning and extending what is possible and appropriate by way of response \u2013 not \njust in terms of individual acts, but also courses of action or institutional policies. \nA third basis for plurality: the responsible agent finds herself amid many forms of \npartiality. We are used to associating responsibility with impartiality \u2013 one prejudice \nagainst responsibility is that it is a cold and impersonal virtue. But it is still true that \nclaims of intimates, friends and family weigh on the responsible person. More important \nagain are the partialities created by our institutional roles and affiliations: a manager is \nresponsible for her employees, a teacher to his students, a club member to fellow \nmembers (this is part of what we mean when we speak of an area of responsibility). The \nresponsible person must be a skilled judge of the particular relationships she has to \nothers, the demands that each relationship poses, and the demands that others are \nentitled to make. The same is true of an organisation, which must constantly take a view \nas to the legitimacy of the many demands made of it. \nFinally, every responsible agent is firmly embedded in a \u2018non-ideal\u2019 context. Things go \nwrong and situations are complicated.11 We can add: agents do wrong and agents are \ncomplicated. Part of Weber\u2019s well-known \u2018ethics of responsibility\u2019 was that the \nstatesman (or in general, the responsible person) cannot simply rely on \u2018principles\u2019: \nothers\u2019 wrong-doing must be dealt with, and this generally involves compromises one \nwould prefer not to make \u2013 actions and measures that would not be needed in an \u2018ideal \nworld\u2019 (cf Weber, 1919: 440ff). Certainly, it requires complex judgments about how far \n                                                 \n10  This claim might be supported by the many studies of organisational wrong-doing, from Hannah \nArendt\u2019s study of Eichmann\u2019s conscience (1965) to Robert Jackall\u2019s study of American corporate life \n(1988). See further Bovens 1998 on accountability within organisations. \n11  As Strawson put it in \u2018Freedom and Resentment\u2019 (1962). \nResponsibility as a virtue \n11 \nagents have lived up to particular or general responsibilities, and who should exact what \nsort of accountability (\u2018hold them responsible\u2019). Responsibility is always a matter of \nliving with agents as they are, as well as what they might become, and doing so in terms \nof one\u2019s particular relationships and responsibilities toward them. \nIn addition to this emphasis upon plurality, I have also selected some other terms in \nwhich to speak of responsibility. First, I think it is helpful to describe the demands upon \nresponsible agents in the loosest terms: hence my term \u2018normative demands,\u2019 rather \nthan, say, responsibilities, duties or \u2018reasons.\u201912 Thinking about matters from the \nperspective of the agent herself, as well as those she (or it) interacts with, we need to \ncapture all the prima facie claims which people believe should prompt the agent to act \nor judge in one way rather than another. Such claims upon our attention and concern go \nwider than many accounts of \u2018morality\u2019 or \u2018reason,\u2019 to include everything that \nparticipants or observers feel should matter to an agent\u2019s choice. Naturally, these \ndemands may not have the precise force they are felt to have, nor (if consciously \narticulated) the exact force they are interpreted as having. In some cases such claims \nmay even be entirely factitious. Nonetheless, which of these claims or interpretations \nshould really guide thought and action \u2013 this is something the responsible agent must \nnegotiate with those around her. \nSecond, following the derivation of the word, I speak of \u2018responding\u2019 to demands. This \ntoo is very loose. Evidently, what constitutes an adequate or appropriate response is a \nthoroughly normative matter, and often represents a difficult question of experience and \njudgment. (Some responses, such as denial or avoidance, are typically components of \nirresponsibility.) From the perspective of an agent interacting with many other agents, \n                                                 \n12  Many contemporary accounts of responsible agency find its most distinctive feature in \nresponsiveness to reasons (eg, Wolf 1990, Wallace 1994, Fischer and Ravizza 1998). When we judge \nan agent to be more or less responsible it seems fair to suppose that she proves more or less \nresponsive to the relevant reasons \u2013 indicating another direct connection between the virtue and \nresponsible agency. However, to note this connection is to raise a delicate question, beyond my scope \nhere, as to whether responsible agency comes in degrees, so that human beings may be unequal in \ntheir moral capacities. However this may be, our judgments of people as more or less (ir)responsible \ncertainly pronounce some as better than others in negotiating key areas of moral and practical life. \nResponsibility as a virtue \n12 \nthe question is: Who judges whether a response is fitting? Or: who is authorised to hold \nthe agent to account? And on the other side, it must be part of the responsible agent\u2019s \ntask to render account \u2013 as to how she has understood the demands upon her, as to how \nher actions can be taken as adequate or appropriate responses to these. Naturally, these \nresponses need not be articulated: an important part of accountability lies in accepting \nthe force of others\u2019 reactions (which, in turn, need not be articulated) and adjusting \none\u2019s actions or course of action to take account of these. (I make this last point to \nemphasise that responsibility is firstly concerned with actions, and only secondarily \nwith articulations.) \nFinally, I believe it is helpful to think about responsibility in terms of \u2018readiness\u2019 \u2013 that \nis, both willingness and ability. When philosophers speak of \u2018responsibility\u2019 as a basic \nfeature of normal human agency they generally mean something like the capacity to act \non the basis of reasons (or, in my looser terminology, to respond to normative \ndemands). When we use the term to praise an agent we are indeed partly concerned with \nhis ability \u2013 hence the many variations in the intrinsic capacities of human beings and \norganisations. (Note, however, that abilities are also relative to the demands and \npossibilities of situations \u2013 as I will stress below, the ability to fulfil any complex task \ndepends very much on one\u2019s circumstances.) In addition, we are also concerned with an \nagent\u2019s will to employ his abilities \u2013 that is, we are judging the extent to which he \nperceives and accepts his responsibilities. For our purposes, the phrase \u2018holding \nsomeone responsible\u2019 is somewhat misleading, because the virtue of responsibility \ninvolves what others can neither compel nor instruct: as Fingarette stressed, \nresponsibility is about acceptance of the demands one faces. \nAs indicated above, this is to view the virtue in highly schematic terms, to the point \nwhere it may seem wholly divorced from particular judgments of whether an agent \u2013 be \nit an individual or a collective \u2013 has manifested responsibility. This is deliberate. In any \ngiven situation \u2013 and especially, as I shall stress in a moment, amid the complexities of \nlife in modern societies \u2013 it will be a matter of judgment both broad and deep, as to \nwhat demands really weigh upon an agent, and what sort of responses may be possible \nand appropriate. This question of judgment is fundamental to our subject matter: \nresponsible agents can, and must, judge for themselves and with others. As such, an \naccount of responsibility has to take seriously the capacity of responsible agents to \nResponsibility as a virtue \n13 \njudge, and to judge one another. Nonetheless, if there is one thing that theoretical \nreflection can assert about this process of mutual judgment, it is that a whole host of \ndiverse claims will be made of each agent: the responsible agent must appreciate and \nweigh these demands, and try as best she (or it) can, to negotiate an appropriate \nresponse to them. \nIII A paradox of modern responsibility \nWhy is responsibility no longer a distinctively political concern? The first stage of my \nreply was to examine some features of the virtue of responsibility, underlining above all \nplurality in the demands to which we expect responsible agents to respond to. Putting \nthe matter slightly differently, we might say that responsibility is concerned with the \nsheer difficulty of maintaining and fostering human cooperation in the light of a whole \nrange of limiting factors: the resources and attention that each agent can bring to bear, \nthe competing demands on each agent, the diverging perspectives of plural agents, the \nlimited but overlapping spheres of responsibility of different agents, and the \ncomplexities of mutual accountability amid non-ideal conduct. It is easy to see that \nthese factors weigh especially heavily in political contexts. It is easy, too \u2013 in outline, at \nleast \u2013 to see that they enter into the everyday lives of almost all the members of \nmodern liberal societies. \nAll accounts of modernity allow, even insist, that diversity of expectations and demands \nis especially marked in contemporary societies. At the widest level we seem to lack the \nfixed reference points that were present to pre-modern societies: religion, authority, \nnature, custom. To whom (or what), then, does the responsible agent take herself to be \naccountable, and on what terms? Moreover, a whole series of demands are placed upon \neach agent. Plurality is evident not only in the sea of voices announcing their \nexpectations, but also with regard to the sources of those demands \u2013 not least, the many \nroles individuals take on or are landed with. Again, accounts of modern liberal societies \nagree that our modern situation presents a peculiar absence of fixity. Few are the roles \nwe are born to; characteristically, even the most \u2018natural\u2019 or \u2018involuntary\u2019 roles are \nsubject to loud dispute (what are the claims of family, of ethnicity or nationality, of \nhumanity itself?). Many are the roles we choose: parent, friend, engaged citizen, job-\nResponsibility as a virtue \n14 \nholder, professional, and so on. Furthermore, many of these roles invite on-going \nrenegotiation. Both choice and negotiation open up further fluidity, only increasing the \nplurality of demands upon the actor. \nThis poses an apparent paradox. It is (one may say) all very well to stress plurality in the \ndemands upon us. But it is equally clear that agents must be able to find some way of \nnegotiating and reconciling this plurality. If an agent \u2013 whether a person or an \norganisation \u2013 were to acknowledge a mere sub-set of the demands placed upon her, \nresponsibility would badly fail. Nor can the responsible agent act as if she were the sole \nauthority as to the normative demands that she should honour, or we would lose the \nvital connection between responsibility and mutual accountability. \nIn other words: Responsibility looks as if it has become all but impossible, at just that \nhistorical moment when we articulated the virtue and began to demand it of our \ninstitutions and ourselves. One way of understanding this seeming paradox would be to \nsuggest that we have been driven to notice what has slipped from our grasp. The more \nplural the demands upon us have become, the more we have felt the need for the virtue \nwhich shows us responding to them all, each in its proper measure: thus responsibility\u2019s \nplace in political theory from Burke to Weber. As the expectations that modern societies \nplace upon us \u2013 or that we place upon one another \u2013 have become ever more \nmultifarious, shifting and conflicting, our demand for responsibility has become more \nwidespread, but at the same time more unattainable. Unless there are resources that \nagents are able to draw on in minimising the plurality of demands upon them and in \ndelimiting the plurality of voices that would hold them to account and judge the \nadequacy of their responses, then only pessimism will be justified.  \nMany accounts of the modern age readily concur in such pessimism. Some \ncommunitarians \u2013 Alasdair MacIntyre is the best-known example \u2013 have doubted \nwhether any virtue can be exhibited in an age of such moral fragmentation. The paradox \nthat meets responsibility is actually the paradox of a society that talks of morality but \nResponsibility as a virtue \n15 \nlacks the unity to sustain any ethics at all.13 Trenchant critique may also be found among \nFoucauldian writers, who discern disciplinary forces in our ideals, as elsewhere. Nikolas \nRose, for example, writes of \u2018responsibilisation,\u201914 inviting us to suspect that the virtue \ninvolves impositions which are far from innocent, and perhaps not even meetable. And \nalthough it is only one, rather untheoretical, element in such an argument, the \nprevalence of chronic stress among so many who work hard to meet all the demands \nmade of them \u2013 and which they make of themselves \u2013 might offer persuasive evidence \nfor this suspicion. \nOther writers may be more optimistic. Some liberals \u2013 Rawls is the most prominent \u2013 \ndiscern sufficient overlap in our fundamental values for us to sustain a liberal political \nsettlement. Perhaps one might extend such optimism downwards, to our \u2018politics of \neveryday life.\u2019 In this case, responsibility would still be a task, but not an insuperable \none. \u2013 While I would like to share some of this optimism \u2013 and must do, to sustain my \noverall argument about the rightful place of responsibility in our societies \u2013 I doubt that \nwe can address this paradox of responsibility in terms of supposedly shared values, that \nprevent us from making demands of one another that are irreconcilable in their plurality. \nResponsibility is the moral child of highly differentiated, socially plural societies, and \nthese societies give rise to astonishingly variegated and relentlessly specific moralities \namong their members. Even if there were some fundamental agreement in underlying \nvalues, this would hardly answer to the fragmentation in the actual moralities that we \neach encounter and act on in our daily lives. \nMy own view, then, is that we cannot deny the lack of the fixity and coherence that \ndistinguish our modern moral situation. Against more pessimistic perspectives, \n                                                 \n13  MacIntyre 1981\/4. Bernard Williams has made the related claim that the peculiar degree of \nreflectiveness of modern societies has lent \u2018thicker\u2019 ethical concepts less currency (1985, pp. 163f). \nWilliams does not make clear the logic behind this contested claim. But it is more natural to think \nthat greater social reflexivity calls not for \u2018thinner\u2019 but for more reflexive moral concepts \u2013 \nresponsibility being a case in point. \n14  Rose 1999, pp. 154f, 214f. As with MacIntyre, my brief comments hint at only a small part of his \ncase. \nResponsibility as a virtue \n16 \nhowever, I think we should see responsibility as one of our most essential and \nconstructive moral responses to this lack.15 Nonetheless, to understand how \nresponsibility constitutes a tenable response we must also locate something that unites \nus \u2013 and something much more concrete than any supposed consensus in underlying \nvalues. (\u2013 Not even a consensus upon the virtue of responsibility: as I have interpreted \nit, responsibility may mean very different things to different people, depending on the \ndemands we suppose any given agent to face.) In the next section I argue that this \nunifying factor is the stable, if contested, schemes of cooperation embodied in our \nmodern institutions. That is, to explain the modernity of responsibility, and to show how \nwe might overcome the apparent paradox it poses, we must relate it to our modern \ninstitutional fabric. The way in which organisations delimit the plurality of demands \nupon agents provides the key to our relative success in realising responsibility. At the \nsame time, it explains why responsibility has become so important to us. \nIV What makes responsibility possible? \nMy claim is that the central occasion for our discovery \u2013 or invention \u2013 of responsibility \nis the peculiarly institutional and peculiarly reflexive character of modern societies \u2013 not \njust in the formal political sphere, but across every field of life. As McKeon argued, a \nliberal political background is important to the genesis of responsibility, as power \ncomes to be shared in and beyond representative assemblies. But this political origin is \nno longer evident on a day-to-day basis: we most commonly demand and speak of \nresponsibility without reference to overtly political matters, and most of us bear quite \nminimal or sporadic political responsibilities.16 \n                                                 \n15  There are obviously many more, but most of these have been more widely recognised, and are more \nobviously political in character, than responsibility (eg, civic and welfare rights, toleration, or \nprocedural justice). \n16  Of course, many think that our responsibilities in this regard are, or ought to be, greater than liberal \ntheory usually takes them to be. Sympathetic as I am to this line of thought, it does not affect the \noverall point being made here. \nResponsibility as a virtue \n17 \nHowever, our customary lack of political activity does not mean that we do not possess \ncertain powers. In a liberal democracy it is a matter of course that important powers \nbelong to a wide range of institutions \u2013 from schools to parliaments, corporations to \ncharities. More, it is a distinctive feature of these societies, remarked on by almost all \ntheorists, that we take it for granted that all our institutions can and should be remade to \nsuit human wants and interests. Such attempts at change come not just from above (eg, \nthe directives of government) but from below, through the actions of individuals and \norganisations, usually outside of formal political processes. For examples: citizens may \nform a new charity to address a particular social concern, or a regulatory agency may \nalter the liabilities of certain financial institutions. \nThis self-reflexive web of institutions in turn distributes non-negligible powers to the \nhuge numbers of people occupying roles within it. In this stunningly novel historical \nsituation, the responsibility implied by power has become an intimate and universal \nconcern \u2013 of the many vested with such powers, to everyone who is affected by their \nexercise. Responsibility is a central demand when we are granted significant discretion \nor power, wherever innovation, change, and fluidity rob practices of fixity, so that our \nmutual expectations require on-going renegotiation. This need to negotiate a plurality of \ndemands is present to almost every member of our society, and in almost every field of \nlife. \nThere is obviously much to say about these facets of modern social and political life \u2013 \nfacets, as I have argued elsewhere (Williams 2006), that are not sufficiently taken \naccount of in contemporary liberal theory. But I think even these very selective \ncomments allow us insights into responsibility omitted in contemporary philosophical \ndiscussion \u2013 or, indeed, taken as read in applied ethics, when we investigate the \nparticular responsibilities of individuals or organisations. Amid this institutional fabric, \na very large number of people are granted highly specific and delimited powers by \nvirtue of the roles they choose or accept. These often include powers to redefine roles \nand relationships, even to reform institutions. These role-occupants are also granted \nresources to enable them to achieve certain tasks, as well as to reward them for their \nefforts. With power, accountability: Roles expose actors to accountability via specific \nchannels, and often involve holding others accountable. Although many such \ninteractions cross the boundaries of particular institutions, as when one agency oversees \nResponsibility as a virtue \n18 \nanother, or a body provides services to another, they are nonetheless channelled and \ndelimited by institutional frames. \nIn emphasising the institutional background of this virtue, I mean to argue that \nresponsibility is a moral achievement, but that its basis is not to be found at the level of \nideas or beliefs or \u2018values.\u2019 What is central is the moral division of labour created by \nour institutional fabric. This scheme of cooperation delimits the normative demands \nupon each of us, by defining particular spheres of responsibility. Given the fluidity, \nplurality and disagreement associated with normative demands in modern societies, this \nlimitation is crucial. Without it, we would be left in a situation of paralysing uncertainty \nor desperate decisionism. When institutional fabrics break down, the result is clear to \nsee: unable to respond to all the demands upon them, and deprived of organised \nchannels for mutual accountability, people retreat into the local \u2013 closing off moral \nsensitivity by suppositious boundaries between \u2018friend\u2019 and \u2018enemy,\u2019 insider and \noutsider. (Similarly, when institutional fabrics are weak or near-absent, as in many \ninternational contexts.) \nAt the same time as limiting the range of demands upon us, of course, our moral \ndivision of labour greatly intensifies others. As well as highly specific chains of \naccountability, agents accept highly specific responsibilities that could not even be \nconceived of without a very complex scheme of cooperation \u2013 from maintaining these \nrailway tracks, to teaching this group of students, to defining the priorities of my \ncompany. Clearly, we are able \u2013 morally as well as practically \u2013 to attend to these \nbecause others have specific responsibilities for other matters, and often to check and \ncounterbalance our own activities. My organisation can focus on profit because they are \ncompeting and he is regulating and they are enforcing, and so on. \nOf course, some of these realities are not entirely new. Deliberately created \nbureaucracies, for instance for taxation, are very old indeed. What is new, however, is \nthe ubiquity of these factors, that they impinge in so many ways upon every member of \nthe liberal polity. Everyone is aware of the artificial character of our institutions, and \neveryone aware of some entitlement, however minimal, to demand or contribute to their \nreform in the name of her own or others\u2019 needs and interests. (Our willingness to apply \ncategories of vice and virtue to our organisations is one reflection of this item of modern \nResponsibility as a virtue \n19 \ncommon sense.) Similarly, we often contest the responsibilities attaching to individual \nroles. A series of empowerments enable us to do both: the privileges attaching to \nindividual roles and positions; more particular, highly variable membership rights; and \u2013 \nnot least \u2013 overarching legal and citizenship rights. In other words, politically secured \nrights \u2013 freedoms to associate, to found new organisations, to leave particular roles, to \nspeak out \u2013 remain central to the operation of this institutional fabric and its successful \ndistribution of powers. Hence the important coincidence between responsibility and the \nemergence of democratic government, notwithstanding the largely non-political \ncharacter of most manifestations of responsibility. \nV What makes responsibility necessary? \nWhen moral and political philosophy are not idealising the rights and freedoms of \nmodern society, their default mode is critique \u2013 a contrast I already drew attention to in \nopposing possible communitarian and Foucauldian perspectives to an (admittedly na\u00efve) \nliberalism. In emphasising responsibility I mean to take distance from both tendencies. \nStriking as our freedoms are, our mutual dependence is still more inescapable. While \nliberal societies have sufficient failings to think complacency a real danger, failures to \nrecognise these achievements are also common and problematic. The membership of a \nmodern polity makes more extensive, variegated demands of itself than any other \ncommunity in human history \u2013 the rights we are accorded, the material goods available, \nthe powers and opportunities open to most citizens, would stretch the imagination of \nany previous generation. We achieve this via a division of responsibilities that is \nwithout precedent \u2013 not only astonishingly complex but also highly reflexive and \nresponsive. \nIn emphasising the virtue of responsibility, I am suggesting that this constitutes a \nspecifically moral achievement. Despite the many centrifugal forces of modern \nsocieties, despite their materialism and inequalities, despite the currency of ideological \nor self-serving notions of freedom and autonomy \u2013 despite all this, it is striking that \nmost of us not only depend on one another but act in ways that allow others to depend \non us. Most people take on extensive and demanding responsibilities, and \u2013 to their \ngreat moral credit \u2013 many of them act responsibly, often across all the roles they play. \nResponsibility as a virtue \n20 \nThey thereby sustain a fabric of relationships and institutions that, for all the costs it \nmay exact of us (\u2013 and of some far more than others, of course), channels immense \nenergies toward meeting one another\u2019s needs and wants. \nOf course, this division of labour is never perfect; sometimes it turns out very faulty \nindeed. That is to say: if our institutional fabric makes responsibility possible, it also \ncontinually demands responsibility of agents. One reason for this, regardless of any \norganisational gaps or flaws, lies in the essential connections between responsibility, \ncommitment and judgment. However closely our roles and responsibilities are specified, \nand however tightly accountability is enforced, we still need to act so that others may \ndepend on us, and to exercise initiative in balancing and negotiating the various \ndemands upon us. But there are at least three further respects in which responsibility is \nalways demanded, and which highlight its highly reflexive and mutual character. \nI have stressed that responsibility is necessarily connected with mutual accountability. It \napplies not only as we weigh demands, so as to be able to render proper account of our \nactions; it also requires that we be prepared to be held accountable for our actions; and \nfurther, to hold others responsible for their actions. How do agents become aware of the \ndemands upon them? How do others\u2019 expectations of us become expectations of \nourselves? How are allocations of power and resources coordinated so that we can fulfil \nthese demands? How is retrospective responsibility constructively apportioned? \u2013 Our \ninstitutions define roles and relationships, which in turn largely define who should hold \nwhom accountable and in what regards \u2013 from the citizen\u2019s duty to hold politicians \naccountable, to the regulatory agency\u2019s supervisory tasks, to the employee\u2019s need to \nstand up for her rights. These relations of accountability are, in turn, closely defined in \ntheir subject matter, modes of scrutiny, rewards and sanctions. Especially when roles \nare transgressed, however, it is often systematically unclear who is entitled to hold \nwhom to account and by what channels. In the non-ideal contexts that we always \ninhabit, formally defined chains of accountability are never the whole story. So it is \nalways possible that failings in others\u2019 conduct will require responsible agents to step \noutside of these. \nA broader point relates to the demand that we be alert to responsibilities that fall outside \nof our roles. I have argued that responsibility is made possible by a highly sophisticated \nResponsibility as a virtue \n21 \nmoral division of labour, by the separation of different spheres of responsibility. But \nresponsibilities are always liable to fall through the gaps; changing realities are always \nliable to disrupt existing divisions of responsibility; actual powers may be at some \ndistance from notional responsibilities. Or in other words, if everyone merely \u2018does their \njob,\u2019 organisational irresponsibility may still result. In this situation we must all pick up \nthe pieces, look out for unmet responsibilities \u2013 without falling into insubordination or \notherwise infringing on others\u2019 spheres of responsibility.17 Roles define and clarify the \ndemands upon us, but they do not exhaust them. Not least, no moral division of labour \ncan mean that the imperatives of basic human decency cease to speak; the responsible \nagent has these honour to honour, too. \nA third, overarching point concerns the definition and allocation of roles. As the \nresponsibility of a role increases, an agent takes more responsibility for allocating \nresponsibilities to others and negotiating his (or its) own proper sphere of responsibility. \nManagerial and regulatory roles, for example, often involve supervising the adequacy of \nan organisation\u2019s or a sector\u2019s moral division of labour; a parliament must reflect on its \nown responsibilities as a small company need not. How vital these tasks are can be seen \nwhen we recall that agents need to be faced with a manageable plurality of demands. \nOne of the most common sources of irresponsibility, I have been suggesting, is the \noverloading of agents, presenting them with unmeetable or incompatible demands. \nHere, the temptation, even necessity, is to drop certain demands \u2013 to cut moral or \nprocedural corners, to ignore demands not backed by compelling or short-term forms of \naccountability.18 And indeed, much suggests that many agents are overwhelmed by the \nplurality of demands upon them \u2013 to meet the targets, respect their subordinates, honour \nthe law, and so on. Certainly, we are familiar enough with the irresponsibility that \nresults; so too, with how one agent\u2019s irresponsibility can set off a chain reaction in or \nbeyond an organisation. In this situation, responsibility is continually demanded \u2013 not \njust of those who supervise and manage, but also of each role occupant \u2013 in assessing \nthe extent to which roles are manageable and responsibilities properly allocated. \n                                                 \n17  See Bovens 1998 on individual responsibilities within organisations. \n18  This can also happen when several different roles prove incompatible. The best observer of this \nproblem is Chester Barnard 1937, pp. 263ff. More recently, see O\u2019Neill 2002. \nResponsibility as a virtue \n22 \nThe greater the extent to which a given role places one or more of these demands, the \ngreater the responsibility inherent in the role. Equally, we might say that the better an \nagent fulfils each of the dimensions of responsible activity just described, the more she, \nor it, can truly be described as responsible. \nOne final remark. What I have said may seem incautiously optimistic concerning the \ndivision of powers and responsibilities within modern societies \u2013 as if it were relatively \nstraightforward for most of us to meet the many different demands upon us. I think most \nreaders will agree that our experience is much more ambivalent that this: that \nresponsibility often makes considerable demands of us, sometimes even impossible \nones. In the previous section I meant to indicate how our societies are relatively \nsuccessful in channelling demands and modes of accountability; in this section, to argue \nwhy such success is always partial and sometimes parlous. Precisely because our \ninstitutions are imperfect, in their divisions of responsibilities as in other regards, is the \nresponsibility of individual and collective agents so badly called for \u2013 in enforcing \ndemands that others might neglect, in meeting demands that would otherwise go \nunenforced, in noticing demands that fall through the organisational gaps.  \nConclusion \nIn part, my task has been to explain the modernity of responsibility. More important, \nhowever, I have wanted to justify the importance we attach to it, and to locate it among \nthe moral achievements of modern liberal societies. I have not denied that there may be \na basis for talking about responsibility wherever human beings bring their concern and \ninitiative to bear on their situation. Philosophers, of course, have always had reason to \nenquire into the moral agency that is a precondition of this concern, and into the \nresponsibility for past actions that belongs to our agency. We have seen that the virtue \nof responsibility, in turn, depends on basic features of our moral agency \u2013 to move \nbetween different frames of reference, between past and future; likewise, it involves \nanswering to others for failures to fulfil our responsibilities. But I also hope to have \nshown how people in modern societies have more reason to demand the virtue of \nresponsibility of one another than those in any previous historical period: so extensive, \nResponsibility as a virtue \n23 \nso variegated, so fluid are the demands we make of ourselves, of one another, of our \norganisations. \nI have discussed the virtue of responsibility in very abstract terms, as the readiness to \nrespond to a plurality of normative demands. This may be discomforting in at least two \nrespects. In the first place, as I stressed above, it leaves a great deal open: which \ndemands are valid, which responses appropriate? \u2013 I have suggested that a philosophical \naccount of responsibility may abstain from closer judgment of these questions. To speak \nof \u2018responsible agents\u2019 presupposes that those agents are able to judge, and that where \nthey fail to judge rightly, that other agents are qualified to judge this and hold them \nresponsible. I have left a great deal open because so much is the prerogative of \nresponsible agents themselves. \nWe might also feel some discomfort for a second, rather different reason. My argument \nhas linked an agent\u2019s capacity to manifest responsibility to particular, contingent \nconditions of society and politics. This implies, then, that responsibility may fail, \ndespite an agent\u2019s own best intentions. A will to respond to the plurality of normative \ndemands faced is, I have suggested, not enough: there must also be ability. This is partly \na question of the capacities an agent brings to the situation: an individual\u2019s imagination, \nperseverance, judgment and so on; an organisation\u2019s resources, flexibility, managerial \ncapability and so forth. But to be able to manifest responsibility also requires the \ncooperation of one\u2019s circumstances; thus the crucial role of modern institutions in \ndelimiting spheres of responsibility and defining relations of accountability. This \nvulnerability of responsibility to circumstances seems to me appropriate. The virtue of \nresponsibility emerges from our accountability to, and dependence on, one another. \nWhere mutuality fails, then, no surprise that responsibility falters too. In other words: \nresponsibility is not quite the property of an individual that we may think of when we \nspeak of a virtue. Responsibility reveals not only our material and organisational \ninterdependence upon each other, but also, I should like to say, our moral \ninterdependence. \nA final point is also striking. Unlike many other virtues, responsibility is a virtue of \ncollectivities as well as individuals. Despite the profound differences between \nindividual and collective agency, about which I have been able to say nothing here, \nResponsibility as a virtue \n24 \nthere is a remarkable symmetry: almost everything that one can say about the \nresponsible person can be said of the responsible organisation. I have argued that the \nresponsible organisation and the responsible individual depend profoundly on one \nanother, by virtue of the roles that both create and both fulfil. Both, in turn, depend upon \na wider fabric of responsible institutions, that involves networks of accountability and \ndivisions of responsibilities. The symmetry between responsibility as individual and \norganisational virtue reflects this mutual dependence of individual and collective, when \nresponsibility is manifested among us. \nAcknowledgements \nI would like to thank the European Academy Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler for its generous \nsupport during the writing of this paper, and the Centre for Ethics, Philosophy and \nPublic Affairs at the University of St Andrews for its support during the initial research. \nFor comments I would like to thank audiences at Lancaster University, the European \nAcademy and the Philosophy Club at Purchase College, State University of New York, \nas well as: David Archard, Margaret Canovan, Ruth Chadwick, Sean Crawford, Robin \nDownie, John Foster, Carl Friedrich Gethmann, Jorge Guerra Gonz\u00e1lez, Morris Kaplan, \nOnora O\u2019Neill, Darius Rejali, Doris Schroeder, Udo Schuklenk and William Torbert, as \nwell as two anonymous referees for this journal.  \nReferences \nArendt, H.
