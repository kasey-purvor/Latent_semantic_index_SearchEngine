However, there have been few\nstudies of the phenomenon actually in progress. This article describes the\ndevelopment of a new variety in the English New Town of Milton Keynes,\ndesignated in 1967. The article is structured around eight \u201cprinciples\u201d that\nrelate the process of koineization to its outcomes. Recordings were made of\n48 Milton Keynes-born children in three age groups (4, 8, and 12), the prin-\ncipal caregiver of each child, and several elderly locally born residents. Quan-\ntitative analysis of ten phonetic variables suggests that substantial but not\ncomplete focusing occurs in the child generation. The lack of linguistic con-\ntinuity in the New Town is demonstrated, and the time scale of koineization\nthere is discussed. Finally, it is shown that demography and the social-\nnetwork characteristics of individuals are crucial to the outcomes of koi-\nneization. (Language change, language variation, dialect contact,\nkoineization, English dialects, child language, New Towns.)*\nIt has long been recognized that many types of change affecting the language of a\ncommunity diffuse gradually across geographical space and through human pop-\nulations. However, they do not do so automatically and mechanically; there is a\nsocial and geographical orderliness about the spread that suggests the presence of\nwhat Labov (1972:162) calls \u201csocial embedding.\u201d In other words, the spread of a\nchange mirrors certain aspects of social structure. However, as many sociolin-\nguists now realize, we need to go to the individual to understand the behavior that\nleads to the adoption or rejection of potential changes.As J. Milroy 1992 points out,\nit is speakers who both innovate and adopt. If this is true, the propagation of change\nmust be a direct consequence of the interaction between individuals \u2013 mediated,\nof course, by numerous social, social-psychological, and psycholinguistic factors\nthat affect those individuals in a particular encounter. Viewed from this stand-\npoint, the vast majority of interactions involve language contact \u2013 or, within a sin-\ngle language community, dialect contact, where the latter is defined as the contact\nLanguage in Society 29, 65\u2013115. Printed in the United States of America\n\u00a9 2000 Cambridge University Press 0047-4045000 $9.50 65\nbetween speakers of any mutually intelligible language varieties (Trudgill\n1994:13).1 Before short-term interactions between speakers of similar varieties can\nlead to permanent language change, the social conditions must be right for the in-\nstantaneous and often transient acts of linguistic convergence or divergence be-\ntween the speakers (Giles & Coupland 1991) to translate into quasi-permanent\nchanges in speech habits, or \u201clong-term accommodation\u201d (Trudgill 1982, 1986).\nT H E S O C I A L E M B E D D I N G O F K O I N E I Z A T I O N\nSiegel\u2019s 1985 framework\nThis article is concerned with the social conditions for language change, espe-\ncially the time depth of the dialect contact involved. It is also concerned with\nsome of the social-psychological and psycholinguistic factors that affect the lin-\nguistic consequences of contact. We look at a particular, rather dramatic form of\ndialect contact: koineization following the mass settlement of a rather sparsely\npopulated area. This is what Siegel (1985:364) calls an \u201cimmigrant koine,\u201d as\ndistinct from a \u201cregional koine,\u201d where the new variety exists side by side with\nthe contributing dialects. Koineization, according to Siegel\u2019s most general defi-\nnition (1993:6), refers to \u201cthe linguistic processes that occur when different dia-\nlects or closely related subsystems come into contact.\u201d These processes may lead\nto the emergence of a koine, which he defines as\nthe stabilized result of mixing of linguistic subsystems such as regional or\nliterary dialects. It usually serves as a lingua franca among speakers of the\ndifferent contributing varieties and is characterized by a mixture of features of\nthese varieties and most often by reduction or simplification in comparison.\n(1985:363)\nIn the \u201cimmigrant koine\u201d case, clearly, there is only a very limited sense in which\nthe koine \u201cserves as a lingua franca among speakers of the contributing vari-\neties\u201d: this implies a degree of bidialectalism that is probably rare. However,\nSiegel suggests four stages in the developmental continuum of nativized koines\nwhich provide a framework against which all cases of koineization can be com-\npared. Figure 1 reproduces this framework.\nfigure 1: Developmental continua of a nativized koine (from Siegel 1985:375).\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n66 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\nSiegel explains these stages as follows (1985:373\u201374). The prekoine stage is\nwhere \u201cvarious forms of the varieties in contact are used concurrently and incon-\nsistently. Leveling and some mixing has begun to occur . . . but few forms have\nemerged as the accepted compromise.\u201d Stabilization occurs when new norms\nhave been \u201cdistilled,\u201d and a new compromise subsystem \u2013 i.e. a variety related on\none or more linguistic levels \u2013 has emerged, but it is not used for in-group com-\nmunication. A koine may become a literary language or a standard, in which case\nit is said to be expanded. Finally, it may become nativized, in which case it\nacquires all the functions of a normal first language; it may be subject to further\nelaboration, as well as to changes that are not ascribable to the dialect mixture.\nImportantly, the two middle stages can be bypassed altogether. This is the case\nfor Fiji Hindi (Siegel 1987) and H\u00f8yanger Norwegian, both of which therefore\nfall under Type 1 in Figure 1 (Omdal 1977, Trudgill 1986:95\u2013106, Siegel 1993).\nSiegel\u2019s framework can be taken as a partial model of the time variable in koi-\nneization. However, in the present article we focus on differences within Type\n1 \u2013 in that we will be identifying factors which lead to variations in the route, the\nspeed and the degree of the linguistic \u201cfocusing\u201d (Le Page 1980) that precedes the\nemergence of a nativized koine.\nThe role of children in koineization\nMost studies of koineization are post-hoc, in that they examine the outcomes of\nthe process several generations after the original migration. However, by focus-\ning on a British \u201cNew Town,\u201d Milton Keynes, just 20 years after it was estab-\nlished, we can treat koineization not as a fait accompli, whose stages must be\nreconstructed (Trudgill 1986, Siegel 1987, Mesthrie 1993, Britain 1997a), but as\na dynamic and complex process that can be investigated as it takes place, using a\ncarefully designed corpus.2\nCentral to the main study reported here is the role of children in koineiza-\ntion \u2013 for two broad reasons, the first psycholinguistic and the second social-\npsychological. Adults are thought to have passed a \u201ccritical period\u201d for language\nacquisition (see Lenneberg 1967 and the largely confirmatory discussion in\nRondal & Edwards 1997:129\u201330), and so are not likely to be able to make\nmajor grammatical and phonological changes to their speech after migration.\nData from second language (L2) acquisition research similarly suggests a grad-\nual deterioration in language-learning aptitude, leveling off at about the age of\n16, with the ability to acquire a native-like accent disappearing first (see Gass\n& Selinker 1994:239\u2013 46). Changes made by adult second-dialect acquirers,3\nwho are the adult group of relevance to koineization, involve simplification;\nthis includes a loss of irregularity in morphology, a reduction in the number of\ngrammatical categories, and an increase in invariable word forms (M\u00fchlh\u00e4us-\nler 1974, cited in Trudgill 1986:103; M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler 1980, cited in Siegel 1985),\nas well as the acquisition of \u201ceasy\u201d features, such as small changes in vowel\nquality and lexical and morpholexical borrowing (Kerswill 1994a:155\u201358;\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 29:1 (2000) 67\n1996a:200). Contrasted with this is the considerable plasticity of children\u2019s pho-\nnologies and grammars up to, approximately, puberty. For fuller discussion,\nsee Trudgill 1992, 1994, 1996a; Chambers 1992, 1995:162\u2013 63; and Kerswill\n1996a.\nThese psycholinguistic factors are inevitably mediated by the changing social\npsychology of the child from infancy to post-adolescence. Children\u2019s social iden-\ntities develop rapidly during this period as they pass through the \u201clife course\u201d\n(summarized by Giddens 1989:82\u201385): they move from a strong attachment to\nthe caregiver; they go through the transitional stage of adolescence, in which\nindividuals see a conflict between their wish to behave as adults and their treat-\nment by the adult world as children; and they arrive at the verge of adulthood,\nwith the incipient need to make independent life-decisions. Each stage is re-\nflected in differences in language use that are associated particularly with changes\nin the child\u2019s orientation to other people. Starting from a parent-centered orien-\ntation, young children expand their range of social contacts to other, often older\nchildren, eventually forming distinctive teenage peer-groups, with their attach-\nment to youth culture and opposition to adult norms. Linguistically, this is re-\nflected in a greater preference for non-standard speech in the mid-teens, at least\nin Britain (Portz 1982; cf. Nordberg 1972, cited in Romaine 1984:107, for related\nfindings in Sweden). It has been argued that it is this stage that is most influential\nfrom the point of view of the genesis of linguistic innovations, if not their geo-\ngraphical spread (Aitchison 1981:180, 1992, 1994, Kerswill 1996a, Eckert\n1997:163; see also Deser 1989 for a spectrographic study suggesting that teen-\nagers align with peers rather than parents in vocalic variables).\nGrowing children\u2019s changing orientation to different groups of people must be\nseen as part of their maturing sociolinguistic competence \u2013 a term which we\nadopt from Ervin-Tripp 1973, and which we define as the knowledge of the forms,\nthe symbolic functions, and the social distributions of language varieties current\nin the speech community. The processes that underlie the formation of new lan-\nguage varieties will be linked to these developing capabilities on the part of the\nchild. For this reason, it is important for us to understand the overall sociolin-\nguistic context of a particular case of koineization.\nBy contrast, adults tend to have more fixed social identities, which they bring\nwith them to the new location. They are therefore less motivated to change their\nspeech habits than are children \u2013 a tendency compounded by the psycholinguistic\nconstraints to which we have already referred. The potential linguistic effect of\nprior social identities is graphically demonstrated by Auer et al. 1997, who show\nhow a former GDR resident\u2019s accommodation to a western German dialect re-\nflects the decrease \u2013 followed, unusually, by the increase \u2013 in his identification\nwith people from his eastern German home town.\nWith certain provisos, then, it is the migrants\u2019 children who are central to the\nlinguistic focusing that precedes the formation of any new, stable variety, as has\nbeen pointed out by a number of linguists (cf. Lanham & Prinsloo 1978:19, Trud-\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n68 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\ngill 1986:95\u201396, Mesthrie 1993:39). This is probably an uncontroversial state-\nment, and it means that children should be the main focus of study. However, the\ndetails of the process of focusing are likely to be complex. In particular, we must\nconsider the age at which children and adolescents can acquire new dialect fea-\ntures, as well as the age at which they form stable peer groups in which new\nnorms can be forged. We must also bear in mind the contribution of the parents\u2019\ndialects to the mixture. Clearly, adults adapt to different language environments,\nthough their accommodation is subject to constraints. Children brought up in a\nmigrated family have, as primary input, language varieties originating elsewhere,\nalbeit modified ones; and it would be surprising if this fact did not have conse-\nquences for their future language development. Thus Aniansson (1996:112), con-\ntrasting the speech of the children of incomers to a Swedish town with that of the\nchildren of locally born people, finds significantly stronger local vernacular fea-\ntures in the latter than in the former.\nThe wider social and historical context\nAll this must be seen against the background of the wider socio-historical process\nbehind each new settlement, and that will be a central theme of this article. Much\nof the argumentation surrounding the development of both pidgins and koines\ninvolves the notion that it is adult language or dialect contact that leads to the\nsimplification processes typical of both. Thus Trudgill 1994 draws a distinction\nbetween this situation and supposed long-term child language contact, where\nchanges \u2013 especially convergent ones, as in Sprachbund phenomena \u2013 can take\nplace without simplification. Much of the argument to be developed in this article\nconcerns the relative importance of children and adults for the outcome of dialect\ncontact. However (to anticipate that argument), it seems to us that, while this\ndistinction is clearly insightful, its use to explain particular cases must be much\nmore nuanced than has often been the case. This is true because, in most cases of\nsettlement, there will be children among the arrivals, and children will be born to\nthe adult migrants.4 These youngsters will quickly form a new \u201cnative\u201d speech\ncommunity; and the degree of linguistic focusing they achieve as the first gen-\neration of natives will depend on a wide range of linguistic and demographic\nfactors, especially the proportion of children to adults in the earliest years of\nsettlement. We will raise the topic of the effect of children vs. adults again in our\ndiscussion of particular dialect contact cases below.\nThus we need to know the exact linguistic and social history of the location\nfrom the time of the start of the mass settlement to the time when a koine emerges.\nThis history covers the following:\n(a) The original population of the area: its size, its social characteristics, and\nits speech forms.\n(b) The size of the incoming population in relation to the original population.\n(c) The abruptness of the settlement: Was it sudden and finite, or did it con-\ntinue over a long period? Did it continue after koineization had taken place?\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 29:1 (2000) 69\n(d) The proportion of children to adults among the incomers and the origi-\nnal population, and the rate at which children were born to the incomers after\nmigration.\n(e) The continued contacts of the incomers with their place of origin: Did they\nbreak off relations with their original home completely, or did they maintain links\nwith it to the exclusion of new, local contacts?\n(f ) The social characteristics and ethnicity of the incomers: Did they come to\ntake up specific jobs, e.g. in a new industry? Were they socially mixed? Were they\nan ethnically distinct group?\n(g) The speech of the incomers: Was it diverse or homogeneous? Was it sim-\nilar to that of the native population? Were some social dialects better represented\nthan others?\nAlthough finding fairly precise answers to these questions is scarcely possible\nat the present state of knowledge, such an investigation will in principle allow us\nto explain the character of a particular case of koineization.\nE F F E C T S O F M I G R A T I O N O N L A N G U A G E C H A N G E\nWe argued above that dialect contact forms the mechanism of the spread of most\nlinguistic changes. In this section, we examine a number of cases where dialect\ncontact has been heightened by the presence of migration \u2013 leading in some\ncases, but not all, to koineization. The respective roles of children and adults will\nbe assessed.\nContact involving L2 speakers\nIn the first two cases, contact is not between native speakers of a language but\ninvolves non-native speakers.\nAfrikaans. In this language we can observe features also found in pidgins \u2013\nspecifically, an extreme simplification and reduction (i.e. loss of formal catego-\nries) in the verb morphology, as well as simplification of noun plural marking, as\ncompared with the Dutch parent dialects. In these respects Afrikaans resembles a\nkoine as well as a de-creolized creole. Trudgill 1996b claims that, despite this, the\nsimplification was not the result of either of these processes (though koineization\nsurely could have played a role), but rather to the presence of relatively large\nnumbers of adult learners of the language in its early years, who presumably were\ninstrumental in passing it on to both ethnically Dutch and non-Dutch children.\nIsraeli Hebrew. The modern language is a \u201crevived\u201d classical language which\nnow performs all the functions of a community vernacular. Contact was en-\ntirely between L2 speakers, yet developments followed a pattern familiar from\nkoineization (indeed, Blanc 1968:238, in his account of the development of Is-\nraeli Hebrew, refers to the language as a \u201ckoine,\u201d a position accepted by Siegel\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n70 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\n1997:129\u201330). As pointed out by Glinert (1989:10, cited by Kerswill 1994a:12),\nthere has been considerable reduction in the phonological inventory, as compared\nto the liturgical language. Like many other Semitic languages, Biblical Hebrew\ndistinguished the pharyngeal consonants 0\u00c90 and 0\u00bf0 and the velar 0x0. Neither\n0\u00c90 nor 0\u00bf0 was acquired by the majority of the (adult) Ashkenazi immigrants,\nwhose first languages were European. Instead, they merged 0\u00c90 with 0x0, a phone\nwidely found in European languages, and deleted 0\u00bf0 altogether. It can in fact be\nclaimed that there was koineization in Hebrew, too. The Sephardic Jews, who had\nan Arabic substrate, used the pharyngeals in their Hebrew vernacular. In the ma-\njority, high-status vernacular, the pharyngeals have been leveled out, despite be-\ning widely regarded as correct.\nUnlike Glinert, Ravid 1995 investigates some of the processes behind these\nchanges. Her study of language acquisition in Hebrew is extremely revealing in\nthat it examines the role of children in the establishment of new spoken norms.\nShe claims that Modern Hebrew is morphologically more opaque (irregular) than\nits antecedents because of the \u201cphonological erosion\u201d which followed its being\n\u201crevived as a spoken medium using a new phonological system only loosely\nrelated to that of Classical Hebrew, with entire phonological classes being oblit-\nerated\u201d (1995:133). Thus she finds, among child learners, the development of\nnon-standard reanalyses of morphological classes which are promoted by the\nprinciples of \u201cTransparency, Simplicity, and Consistency,\u201d but are constrained by\nliteracy and the \u201cliterate propensity towards marked structures\u201d (1995:162). In\nthe immediate post-1945 period, adult L2 Hebrew speakers transmitted the lan-\nguage to children, who nativized the input (doubtless according to a route similar\nto that suggested by Ravid). Significantly from the point of view of koineization,\nthis stabilization is evidently still not complete, even though the majority of Is-\nraeli children now have native Hebrew-speaking parents. The reason for this slow\nfocusing, compared to some cases of dialect contact (see below), may well lie in\nthe fact that the original input two generations ago was an \u201cinterlanguage\u201d (Se-\nlinker 1992), which may have caused greater problems of learning for the nativ-\nizing children.\nContact between L1 speakers\nKoineization in Siegel\u2019s sense can occur only following contact between native\nspeakers. Of course, not all such contacts, even following migration, lead to this\noutcome. In this section, we discuss a number of migration-induced dialect con-\ntact cases, bringing out the demographic, social, and linguistic parameters that\nlead to particular outcomes. To anticipate: We find that focusing occurs in either\nthe second or the third generation (the children or grandchildren of the migrants).\nThe English Fens. Britain\u2019s study (1997a,b) of the variables (ai) and (\u00f6) in a\ndialect contact situation is particularly interesting because of the huge difference\nin the time it took each variable to focus. In the 17th century, two populations\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 29:1 (2000) 71\nmigrated to a newly drained area of eastern England. As it happened, these people\ncame from either side of two isoglosses. One defined the boundary between two\nreflexes of Middle English 0i:0 in words like kite and slide: [AI] to the northwest\nand [@I] to the southeast. The other isogloss defined the border between areas\nwith and without an opposition between 0\u00f60 and 0U0, as in cut and put. He argues\nthat the former conflict was fairly quickly resolved by the \u201creallocation\u201d of the\ntwo variants to pre-voiced and pre-voiceless environments, respectively. How-\never, the clash between dialects with and without the 0\u00f60 \u2013 0U0 opposition led to\nan unstable situation that is only now becoming focused. Reasons adduced to\nexplain this time difference have to do with the relative salience and complexity\nof the features (Britain 1997a). From our point of view, two points are relevant.\nThe first, of course, is that, in any case of koineization, we must be aware of\ndifferences in the potential for different features to focus. Second, Britain argues\nthat the social structures of the 17th century militated against rapid focusing,\neven for (ai):\nChildren in such a scenario [that of extensive dialect mixing] are in the po-\nsition of having to focus a new norm from a diffuse target variety spoken in\na speech community only beginning to develop new social groupings . . . The\nfact that this process in the sparsely populated Fens began well before edu-\ncation was universal (no school environment, therefore, to encourage the\ndevelopment of wider peer group norms) further impedes focused koine de-\nvelopment. (1997a:165)\nIn fact, Britain posits that it is only in the third generation (the grandchildren of\nthe migrants) that focusing is achieved (1997b:37, 41) \u2013 although, inevitably, no\ndirect evidence is available.\nTexas. Thomas\u2019s data (1997) on (ai) show the loss of the stereotypically South-\nern US monophthongal 0aI0 (as in kite, slide) in heavily urbanized areas of Texas\nis in line with the claim that mass migration can lead to the simplification of\nphonologically complex rules. In traditional, rural varieties, monophthongal 0aI0\nis found only before voiced consonants and word-finally \u2013 and as such resembles\nFenland (ai). The loss of the allophonic split in cities, with their large and recent\nin-migrated populations, can be ascribed to simplification. In sharp contrast to\nthe Fens, the societies Thomas describes are presumably open and mobile; large\nnumbers of children and young adults, typical of in-migrant communities, afford\na high possibility of forming new social relationships. In the case of the children,\nthese relationships would doubtless result in school- and neighborhood-based\npeer-groups. Thomas provides statistical evidence of substantial in-migration;\nthe fact that just over half of the parents of his child subjects were from outside\nTexas reflects the scope and recency of the migration (1997:326). If Thomas\u2019s\nsimplification hypothesis is correct, then we should assume that the focusing on\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n72 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\nthe new, simplified norm took place rapidly among the first native-born children,\ndespite children\u2019s attested ability to acquire relatively complex features.\nThe main study to be reported in this article describes a social context which,\nin one way, is similar to metropolitan Texas: Individuals do not form dense, closed\nnetworks, but open ones with links outside the community. We provide direct\nevidence that focusing can take place by the second generation \u2013 the first child\ngeneration in such a community.\nH\u00f8yanger, Odda, and Tyssedal. The development of new towns on the shores\nof fjords in western Norway in the period 1915\u201325 (Sandve 1976, Omdal 1977)\nsaw the mass migration of Norwegians to linguistically near-virgin territory. Be-\ncause of their relative isolation for several decades, owing to poor communica-\ntions, these single-industry ore-smelting towns constitute a \u201cvirtual laboratory\u201d\nfor the study of koineization. Added to that is the fact that we have accurate\nfigures on the regional origins of the migrants and on the rate of population\ngrowth in the early years. The twin towns of Odda and Tyssedal are particularly\ninteresting because of the very different regional provenances of the incomers,\nwhich led to radically different koines developing just five kilometers apart (see\nKerswill 1996b for a discussion of Sandve\u2019s 1976 data). In all three towns, we\nfind leveling \u2013 the reduction of the number of variants of a particular phonolog-\nical, morphological or lexical unit \u2013 as well as simplification (see also Trudgill\n1986:98\u2013106 on H\u00f8yanger).\nAs we shall see below for Milton Keynes, migration to H\u00f8yanger was rapid,\nthough absolute numbers were small. The population grew from just 120 in 1916,\nrising to 953 in 1920 when the factory was opened, and to 2,216 in 1930 (Sand\u00f8y\n1987:158; Arne Olav Nygard, p.c. 1997). There is also evidence of a high birth\nrate. Yet there is strong evidence that focusing took place only in the third gen-\neration (the grandchildren of the migrants). Omdal states: \u201cThe first generation\nwho were born and grew up in H\u00f8yanger . . . do not speak a unified dialect. Their\nspeech bears the imprint of their parents\u2019dialects . . . To find a unified dialect, one\nmust look to the next generation\u201d (1977:7, our translation). Possible explanations\nfor this initial failure of focusing may lie in two factors. First, there was a con-\nsiderable linguistic difference between the input varieties, much greater than in\nthe US or in Milton Keynes. Second, there seems to have been quite strong social\nsegregation, with managers and professionals living in housing separate from\nthat of the industrial workers \u2013 though their children attended the same school.\nImportantly, this separation happened to coincide with considerable dialect dif-\nferences; the unskilled workers came from the same fylke (county) as H\u00f8yanger,\nbut skilled workers, managers, and professionals came from the east (Byrkjeland\n1991; Arne Olav Nygard, p.c. 1997). As a result, it is likely that koineizing ten-\ndencies were slowed, at least between the two main social groups (though focus-\ning within each group could well have taken place early). Only later was there\nconvergence between the groups, as social and geographical allegiances became\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 29:1 (2000) 73\nmore oriented toward the new community. As Trudgill (1986:103\u2013 4) argues,\nthere would have been linguistic accommodation between adults; and the strat-\negies adopted by them would have included some of the simplificatory features\nfound in the later koine (such as those documented by Kerswill 1996c in the\nspeech of West Norwegian adult migrants in Bergen). However, as already pointed\nout, we take issue with Trudgill\u2019s contention (1994) that simplification occurs\nonly where the dialect contact is between adults; in this, as in other new commu-\nnities, the proportion of children is relatively high, and we must not discount the\npossibility that children might have contributed to the simplification. What we\ncan say is that the children present would have had a highly diffuse adult model,\nwhich already contained some simplification and leveling resulting from the adult\naccommodation strategies noted above. An equally relevant factor, however, is\nthe likelihood that the initial social separation prevented the formation of close\npeer-groups involving children from either side of the social divide, with the\nresult that focusing in the town as a whole could not take place until later. We\nshall, however, argue that the presence of a high proportion of children and young\npeople in a new town accelerates the process of koineization.\nThe Dutch polders. Scholtmeijer\u2019s research (1992, 1997) on phonetic vari-\nables in emerging varieties of Dutch, in new settlements in three polders5 re-\nclaimed from the Zuyder Zee in 1930, 1942, and 1957, reveals a very different\npattern from that of the Norwegian new towns. In each case, it seems that there\nwas a distinct break between the settlers\u2019 strongly regional dialectal speech and\nthe speech of their children, who came to speak a highly standardized form of\nDutch, with relatively few traces of the dialect0accent of the older generation.\nThese traces are greatest in the oldest polder. Scholtmeijer concludes that the\nparents\u2019 speech is irrelevant for the development of the children\u2019s speech, and\nthat there is no question of any new dialect in the polders which might be an\namalgam of the varieties from the \u201cold land\u201d (1992:107\u20138). His data suggest that\nhe may be overstating the case for the absence of new varieties; however, he\nascribes the trends he finds to the need for a language variety for external com-\nmunication (1992:145) and the strong impact of schooling in the standard (146).\nThere are probably other factors not directly cited by him as reasons \u2013 especially\nthe continued contact with surrounding districts, through commuting and use of\nservices, as well as the general tendency toward dialect leveling and standard-\nization in the Netherlands (cf. Hinskens 1992:394). The apparently abrupt shift of\nspeech variety between the settlers and their children is, we shall argue below,\nalso true of Milton Keynes.\nChildren in Spitsbergen. M\u00e6hlum\u2019s study (1992a,b) of the highly diffuse\ndialectal situation in the Norwegian Arctic territory of Spitsbergen (Svalbard) is\ninstructive because it allows us to see what children do when there is no possi-\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n74 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\nbility of a stable adult model, or even a stable childhood peer group. A family\u2019s\nstay in the territory lasts on average about ten years; furthermore, families spend\nlong summer breaks on the Norwegian mainland, usually in their place of origin.\nHence children have an \u201cunclear dialect identity\u201d (M\u00e6hlum 1992b:123), express-\ning identification both with the \u201chome\u201d town or village and with Spitsbergen.\nThese children apparently retain a much stronger influence from their parents\u2019\nspeech than do children elsewhere (1992b:121), just as Omdal observed for the\nfirst native-born H\u00f8yanger children. Linguistically, the children are heteroge-\nneous and internally inconsistent \u2013 engaging in code-switching, dialect mixing,\nand the use of a version of mainland standard East (Oslo) Norwegian, all as\n\u201cstrategies of neutrality,\u201d and deployed to show degrees of identification with\ninterlocutors and situations. Children also vary in the degree to which they have\nadopted their parents\u2019dialects, depending on their orientation toward their family\nor their peers. From our point of view, what we learn from this study is the im-\nportance of demographic stability for the establishment of new norms, even among\nchildren. It is also shows us the kinds of linguistic strategies adopted by children\nin extremely diffuse speech communities. These strategies show the children\u2019s\ngreat linguistic adaptability, as compared to adults, as well as their active use of\na very wide (and probably quite un-adult) range of variation to forge individual\nidentities in the absence of stable peer groups.\nSummary\nFrom the preceding discussion, it is clear that the following factors influence the\noutcome of dialect contact:\n(a) The proportion of children to adults in the immediate post-settlement years:\nWhere there is a high proportion of adults, simplification and reduction will oc-\ncur more readily than otherwise, and focusing will not take place until the third\ngeneration. Where there is an unusually high proportion of children (as in most\ncases of migration), there may be a lack of simplification, as well as the presence\nof focusing in the second generation; however, these tendencies can be overrid-\nden by factors b\u2013c.\n(b) A high degree of linguistic difference between the contributing varieties\nand the complexity of individual dialect features found in the mix: The presence\nof these factors will retard focusing.\n(c) The presence of the possibility of forming new social networks among\nchildren and younger people: These possibilities are influenced by demographic\nfactors such as high density of population, a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of population, and the\npresence of universal schooling \u2013 all of which promote rapid focusing.\n(d) A highly normative approach to mother-tongue literacy: This will hinder\n\u201cnatural\u201d processes, including simplification, and will delay focusing (cf. Mod-\nern Hebrew).\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 29:1 (2000) 75\nT H E M I L T O N K E Y N E S S T U D Y\nNew Towns in Britain\nThe British New Towns Programme has been arguably the most striking ex-\nample yet seen of an attempt at comprehensive social and physical and by\nimplication economic planning in this country or in most of the west. (Aldridge\n1979:29)\nThe notion of a New Town is not new. While Plato, Aristotle and Thomas More all\nwrote of new urban utopias (Schaffer 1970), it was not until the late 19th century\nthat the first housing developments were built by enlightened employers for work-\ners: Port Sunlight in Liverpool, and Bourneville near Birmingham. Later, in re-\naction to the appalling housing conditions in 19th-century London, Ebenezer\nHoward developed his ideas on the ideal city: a \u201cgarden city,\u201d a complete social\nand functional structure, limited in size to 30,000 people, self-sufficient in terms\nof jobs, spacious and well laid out. Forming a private company, he established the\nGarden Cities Association in 1902, and soon afterward the garden city of Letch-\nworth was established. In 1920, he joined with Frederick Osborn to build Welwyn\nGarden City. The two garden cities were not immediately successful, however,\nand shareholders waited 20 years for their first dividends.\nThe economic hardship and uncertainty of the interwar years, followed by the\ndestruction of large parts of the inner cities in World War II, led many to reexam-\nine the social and economic basis of society. As Schaffer suggests:\nPerhaps never before or since in British history has there been such widespread\nand informed interest in economic and social affairs among the broad masses\nof the people of all ages, classes and levels of education. With this political\nunderstanding that enabled the nation to be mobilised in an all-out war effort\nagainst fascism came the equal determination that there was to be no return to\nthe unemployment, slums and planless chaos of the thirties. (1970:8)\nIn 1940, Lord Reith was appointed Minister of Public Works and Buildings\nwith special responsibility for reconstruction after the war. Under the wartime\ncoalition government, a Central Planning Authority was established; and this\nwas soon followed by a new Ministry of Town and Country Planning, whose\nresponsibility was to frame and execute \u201ca national policy with respect to the\nuse and development of land throughout England and Wales.\u201d In 1944, Profes-\nsor Abercrombie produced his Greater London Plan, which recommended the\nconstruction of satellite towns within 20 to 50 miles of the center of London, to\nhouse one million people. In 1945, Lewis Silkin was appointed Minister of\nTown and Country Planning in Attlee\u2019s government; and in November 1946,\nthe New Towns Act was passed, which gave the government overall responsi-\nbility for planning and development. Almost immediately, the first New Town,\nStevenage, was designated. Since then, 35 New Towns have been designated,\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n76 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\nalthough not all have materialized. Milton Keynes is the latest and most ambi-\ntious of these developments.\nIn the period between the construction of Stevenage and Milton Keynes, de-\nsign ideas changed significantly. The planners of the first wave of New Towns\ndesignated in the 1940s \u2013 Stevenage, Crawley, Hemel Hempstead, Harlow, and\nBasildon \u2013 were very much influenced by the ideas of Howard, Osborn, and the\nGarden City movement. They were limited in size, self-contained wherever pos-\nsible, and organized into neighborhood units \u2013 focused around local centers with\ncommunity halls, shops, schools, and pubs. However, the rise in car ownership,\nalong with doubts about whether neighborhood planning really did engender a\nsense of local identity, led to a second wave of New Towns, designed to provide\na compact, unified, and strictly urban way of life. In Cumbernauld, Corby and\nSkelmersdale, built in the 1950s, high-density houses cluster around a single\nmulti-level town center. By the 1960s, however, social policies had changed; the\npostwar requirement to rehouse large numbers of people, displaced by war or\nhoused in inadequate dwellings, no longer applied. The guiding principle of the\nthird wave of New Towns, then, was to provide freedom of choice in housing,\nwork, and leisure. High-density housing was rejected in favor of a more dispersed\nsystem of linear developments; houses were concentrated on either side of central\ntraffic roads, with facilities such as shops and schools at regular intervals. Milton\nKeynes, the best-known and largest of the third wave of New Towns, has low-\ndensity housing and is built on a grid system; but it also incorporates elements of\nearlier planning schemes, with an extensive, centrally located city center, and\nwith large green areas of trees and grass distributed throughout the city.\nMilton Keynes\nThe rational in us admires its logic; the romantic in us fears its order. (Bendix-\nson & Platt 1992:viii)\nMilton Keynes, named after the village of the same name, was officially desig-\nnated in 1967. It is situated in the north of the county of Buckinghamshire, on a\nsite of about 8,900 hectares, at a central position roughly 80 kilometers from\nLondon, Oxford, Coventry, and Cambridge; it is usually referred to as the first\n\u201cnew city\u201d in Britain. The population of the area under development, which in-\ncluded three small towns \u2013 Bletchley, Wolverton, and Stony Stratford \u2013 as well as\nthirteen villages, was 40,000 in 1967, and was projected to rise to 250,000 by the\nend of the millennium, although this last figure was later revised to 210,000. In\nspite of some local opposition from the existing small towns \u2013 and from several\nrural parishes, who did not relish the thought of being outnumbered by thousands\nof Londoners \u2013 building progressed so rapidly that, by 1975, some 6,000 con-\nstruction workers were employed in the city. By 1991, the Milton Keynes Devel-\nopment Corporation had created 83,000 jobs, built 44,000 houses, and planted 14\nmillion trees and shrubs.\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 29:1 (2000) 77\nDemography\nAge. In 1990, the year in which the project reported here began, the popula-\ntion of the new city was approximately 145,000 (though the 1991 Census, which\nconsidered an area somewhat larger than the borough of Milton Keynes, put the\nfigure at 176,330). While migration accounts for 80% of the city\u2019s population\ngrowth, it is also true that the general fertility rate in Milton Keynes is consider-\nably higher than the national average, with 67 births per 1,000 women aged 15\u2013\n44. Not surprisingly, the city\u2019s population profile is relatively young; 25% of the\npopulation is under 15 years old, compared with 20% in the rest of England and\nWales, while 43% falls into the 15\u201339 age group (vs. 36% elsewhere; see Table 1).\nThe proportion of people over 60 in the new city is half that in the rest of England\nand Wales. In the period between 1981 and 1990, the number of schoolchildren\naged 5\u201315 in the city increased by 32%, in sharp contrast with the national figure,\nwhich showed a decrease of 14%. Similar trends were perceptible among young\nadults aged 16\u201324, whose numbers in Milton Keynes increased by 54% in the\n1981\u201390 period, while their numbers remained static in the rest of England and\nWales.\nGeographical origins. In the period 1967\u201388, 76.2% of all migrants to Mil-\nton Keynes were from the southeast of England, and of those, half were from\nLondon; see Table 2. More recently, however, the numbers of migrants from\nGreater London has been declining, and there has been an increase in migration\nfrom the surrounding counties of Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, and Northamp-\nTABLE 1.

These changes in migration patterns are reflected in the regional origins\nof our sample families. The proportion of London-born people among the parents\nof the oldest children in our sample is 50%, whereas only 18.7% of parents of the\nyoungest children were Londoners originally; see Table 3.\nSocio-economic profile. Reith and the early planners believed very strongly\nin two guiding principles: first, \u201cbalance,\u201d meaning that each new town should be\na microcosm of contemporary society, with each stratum represented; and sec-\nond, \u201cself-containment,\u201d meaning that each new community should provide all\nthat is necessary for work and daily living. Almost twenty years after its desig-\nnation, the 1988 MKDC Household Survey showed that the socio-economic pro-\nfile of Milton Keynes is largely similar to that of Great Britain, although the\nproportion of the working population in the non-manual categories is slightly\nhigher than in the rest of the country; see Table 4. By 1988, the proportion of\nprofessionals, employers, and managers had increased to 20% of the total work-\ning population. It should be noted here, however, that our sample was made up of\nchildren whose parents were largely manual workers; see Table 5.\nTABLE 2.

It is\nsituated on the boundary between what Trudgill (1990:63) identifies as the South\nMidlands and Home Counties Modern Dialect areas. (The term \u201cHome Coun-\nties\u201d refers to the counties surrounding London, and includes Buckinghamshire.)\nUsing data from the Survey of English Dialects (SED: Orton et al. 1962\u201371,\nOrton, Sanderson & Widdowson 1978), Trudgill finds that these areas are the\nmost innovative of all, in that the forms of traditional speech have moved furthest\nfrom those of Middle English. This fact is explored by Hern\u00e1ndez-Campoy 1996,\nin his use of geographical models of cultural diffusion to explain the relative\ninnovativeness or conservatism of Trudgill\u2019s sixteen dialect areas. The Home\nCounties dialect area includes London, which is thought to be the origin of many\nof the cited changes. There is evidence that the artery running northwest from\nLondon, through the Midlands, was already the most important communications\nlink in the 18th century (Thrift 1990, cited by Hern\u00e1ndez-Campoy 1996:116).\nThe reason why this artery is the conduit of linguistic innovations is readily seen:\nPeople traveled along this axis, bringing innovations to the social groups who\nwere open to such influences in the communities they came into contact with\n(cf. Milroy & Milroy 1992 on the importance of such \u201cweak ties\u201d for the spread\nTABLE 4.

Southeastern dialect leveling persisted during the 20th\ncentury, too (Edwards 1993:215\u201316); and as we shall see, it continues today\nindependently of the presence of New Towns, though doubtless accelerated by\nthe population mobility they fostered (Williams & Kerswill 1999).\nFor the village of Stewkley, about eight kilometers south of Milton Keynes,\nSED records reveal some traits of traditional speech in the area:\n(a) Rhoticity (0r0 in arm etc.). The border between rhotic and non-rhotic areas\nlies close to Stewkley.\n(b) The Southern opposition between 0\u00f60 in cut and 0U0 in put. (Almost uniquely\nin England, a small lexical set including foot, soot, and brook contain 0\u00f60.) The\narea with no opposition lies about 50 kilometers to the north.\n(c) Southern 0A:0 in items corresponding to the lexical set of path, cast etc.\n(d) Simplification of initial 0wU0 to 0\u00f60 in wood, woman. This and the use of\n0\u00f60 in foot etc. are features peculiar to this area (see Upton & Widdowson 1996:16\u2013\n17); they have now been lost.\n(e) No l-vocalization in items like hill.\n(f ) Dropping of initial h.\n(g) Glottal stop for intervocalic 0t0. (This is an innovative feature now general\nin much of Britain.)\nInformation like this allows us to establish the degree of linguistic continuity\nbetween a New Town and its hinterland (see below).\nMethod\nThe methods used in the research were in the Labovian quantitative tradition. To\ninvestigate sociolinguistic maturation and to measure the extent of focusing, a\nsample was constructed that included a range of age groups. However, while this\nwould appear at first sight to be an apparent-time design, the different age groups\ncannot be said to represent stages in the emerging dialect (as it would be possible\nto demonstrate with adult speakers), since the children\u2019s own phonologies were\nstill developing.\nSample. A socially homogeneous group of 48 children (eight boys and eight\ngirls from each of three age groups \u2013 4, 8, and 12), who had been born in Milton\nKeynes or who had moved there within the first two years of life, was recorded\ninitially in 1991. In addition, the principal caregiver of each child was recorded.\nIn 46 cases, this was the mother; the two remaining children were cared for by an\naunt and the father, respectively. The children attended a nursery, a first school,\nand a middle school, respectively, in two adjacent neighborhoods; these were\namong the first developments in the New Town, with a high proportion of the\nhousing available for rent. Given the housing type and employment patterns, it\nwas anticipated that there would be a range of identifiable regional accents. The\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 29:1 (2000) 81\nselection procedures, which involved approaching schools and parents and re-\nquesting volunteers, gave a representative sample within the parameters of age\nand sex. In the case of the 4- and 8-year-olds, all of whom attended the local\nschool, this meant that, with the exception of one or two children who declined to\ntake part, we recorded all the children in those age groups in that area. A break-\ndown of the migration patterns of our sample families shows that they can be said\nto be representative of the Milton Keynes population as a whole; see Tables 2\nand 3. However, in terms of socio-economic status, the sample families did not\nspan the social spectrum, but formed a homogeneous group employed mainly in\nmanual occupations and living in rented housing; see Table 5.\nData. The aim of the recordings was to obtain a range of speech styles for\neach child. The first stage of recording, carried out between January and July\n1991, was the more comprehensive. The second, in late 1992, enabled us to log\nchanges and to obtain further data on certain variables. The children were re-\ncorded in their schools, in friendship pairs, carrying out several activities: reading\na word list (8- and 12-year-olds); carrying out tasks to elicit single words (iden-\ntifying objects blindfold, answering quiz questions); doing connected speech tasks\n(\u201cspot the difference pictures,\u201d map reading); taking part in interviews; and in-\nteracting with their peers in the playground and in the classroom. The parents\nwere interviewed for approximately one hour in their homes \u2013 the aim being to\nrecord a sample of fairly informal speech, which could be compared with that of\ntheir offspring, and to obtain biographical data on the regional origins and social\npractices of the family.6 To obtain samples of the dialect spoken in the area before\nthe construction of Milton Keynes, six elderly residents who had lived all their\nlives in the area were recorded. In addition, the SED provided further information\non the nearby village of Stewkley.\nThe data were transcribed auditorily by AW, and cross-checked by PK (inter-\nviews, 20\u201330 tokens; elicitation tasks, 10\u201315 tokens; reading task, at least three\ntokens). The transcription phase for each variable began with the authors agree-\ning on a set of variants and their auditory criteria. Scores for the 10 variables in\neach style were calculated for each of the 96 subjects, and were entered in three\ndata bases \u2013 Children 1991, Children 1992 and Parents \u2013 on a Sun computer at\nReading University. Statistical tests, including t-tests, ANOVA, MANOVA, cor-\nrelations, and Principal Components analyses were carried out on the data using\nthe SAS package.\nVariables. Following a pilot study in a socially mixed district of Milton\nKeynes, 10 phonological variables were selected for the main study. The chosen\nfeatures are characteristic of southern English speech, and evidence indicates that\nthey are already involved in variation and change. The variables are listed below.\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n82 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\nConsonants\n(th) word-initial, word-medial, word-final voiceless 0T0, as in three, noth-\ning, tooth, where the dental fricative can be replaced by [f].

The variable concerns the\nfronting and unrounding of the second part of this diphthong, to give\ne.g. [\u00e1Y] or [\u00e1I].\n(ai) the vowel in my, price etc. This ranges from [OI], through [AI], to [ taI].\nP R I N C I P L E S O F K O I N E I Z A T I O N\n\u201cPrinciples\u201d as general behavioral tendencies\nIn an earlier essay (Kerswill & Williams 1992) we presented ten \u201cprinciples of\ndialect contact,\u201d based on our own and other published data. In this article, we\nadapt these principles to make them more specifically applicable to koineization.\nThe notion of a \u201cprinciple\u201d has been used by Chambers (1988, 1992) in a rather\nsimilar context; our indebtedness to his work and to that of Trudgill 1986 will be\nobvious. Chambers discusses the acquisition of second-dialect features by a group\nof Canadian children who had moved to England, and he uses the term \u201cprinci-\nple\u201d to capture the tendencies he observes. For example, his first Principle of\nDialect Acquisition (1992:677) states: \u201cLexical replacements are acquired faster\nthan pronunciation and phonological variants.\u201d He goes on to compare the Ca-\nnadian children\u2019s acquisition of specifically British lexical items (such as queue\nfor line-up) with British pronunciations (such as [t@9mA:t@U] for [t@9meIQoU]);\nthe latter lags behind the former quite markedly. Chambers\u2019s data are essentially\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 29:1 (2000) 83\nquantitative: children acquire the features gradually, not in a completely uniform\norder. Thus we are not dealing with rule-governed behavior in a strict sense, even\nthough the data could probably be fitted into an implicational scale. Instead, there\nare tendencies for behavior to be modified in a certain way.\nIt seems to us that one reason why these principles are not rules lies in their\nmotivation. As will be clear from the preceding discussion of dialect contact, we\nneed to bring to bear a variety of factors to account for our own principles of\nkoineization. Mainly these are sociolinguistic, but they are also psycholinguistic\n\u2013 in particular, developmental. There is no reason at all why such diverse expla-\nnations should lead to categorical scaling, or to clear rule-governed relationships\ninvolving linguistic features in a contact situation.\nOutcomes, individuals\u2019 long-term accommodation, and sociolinguistic factors\nAs we have suggested, there is a prima-facie relationship between individuals\u2019\nlong-term accommodation and post-contact varieties. This is true because the\nlatter are the product of one or two generations\u2019 collective long-term accommo-\ndation. Thus we expect to find linguistic outcomes that are the reflexes of indi-\nvidual behavior of two or more generations earlier.Added to this are sociolinguistic\nfactors, which intervene between individuals\u2019 ability to accommodate and the\nformation of the new dialect. At least two groups of principles must therefore be\nestablished, reflecting (a) the outcomes of contact, and (b) the accommodatory\nstrategies of migrants and their children. To these we add a third, concerned with\nthe time-scale of koineization. The remainder of the article will be structured\naround eight principles, which are summarized below.\nOutcomes in post-contact varieties:\n(1) Majority forms found in the mix, rather than minority forms, win out.\n(2) Marked regional forms are disfavored.\n(3) Phonologically and lexically simple features are more often adopted than\ncomplex ones.\nThe migrants and the first generation of native-born children:\n(4) Adults, adolescents, and children influence the outcome of dialect contact\ndifferently.\n(5) The adoption of features by a speaker depends on his or her network\ncharacteristics.\nThe time scale of koineization:\n(6) There is no normal historical continuity with the locality, either socially or\nlinguistically. Most first and second generation speakers are oriented toward lan-\nguage varieties that originate elsewhere.\n(7) From initial diffusion, focusing takes place over one or two generations.\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n84 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\n(8) Because of sociolinguistic maturation, the structure of the new speech com-\nmunity is first discernible in the speech of native-born adolescents, not young\nchildren.\nO U T C O M E S I N P O S T - C O N T A C T VA R I E T I E S\nWe begin with the outcomes, rather than the processes, because it is easier to\nunderstand the latter with the hindsight afforded by the new dialects themselves.\nThe three principles under this heading are concerned with leveling and\nsimplification. As mentioned above, we take \u201cleveling\u201d to refer to the reduction\nin the number of variants (usually originating in different dialects) of a particular\nphonological, morphological, or lexical unit (cf. Trudgill 1986:98 for a similar\ndefinition). \u201cSimplification\u201d refers to an increase in morphological regularity, an\nincrease in invariable word forms, and a decrease in the number of morphological\ncategories. In addition, \u201csimplification\u201d covers morphological and lexical trans-\nparency (cf. Trudgill 1986:103).\nPrinciple 1: Majority forms found in the mix, rather than minority forms, win out.\nThis principle and the following one (\u201cMarked regional forms are disfavored\u201d)\nhave similar effects, in the sense that the stock of variants for a given linguistic\nunit \u2013 phonological, morphological, or lexical \u2013 as they occur in the immediate\npost-settlement period, is reduced to just one, or to a very small number.\nIt comes as no surprise that features found in the majority of the (southeastern\nnon-standard) \u201cinput\u201d varieties are also found in full measure in Milton Keynes.\nThus the children in our sample have mainly [f] for 0T0, [v] for intervocalic 0D0\n(Trudgill 1990:75\u201380, J. Milroy 1996, Kerswill & Williams 1997, Williams &\nKerswill 1999), and [\u00bf] for intervocalic and final 0t0. A number also have the\nlabiodental [V] for 0r0 (here there is evidence of a very recent spread, cf. Trudgill\n1988, Docherty & Foulkes 1996); and [h] is also variably \u201cdropped.\u201d A further\nindication of the mainstream nature of the accent is the absence of postvocalic r.\nThis was present in the 1950s in Stewkley, as we saw above, and was also used by\nsome of the elderly people in our sample. This feature has been lost in the south-\neast, and (among younger people at least) is now largely restricted to rural west-\nern and southwestern speech.\nPrinciple 2: Marked regional forms are disfavored.\nPrevious studies of new dialect formation show that forms which have a re-\nstricted regional currency, or which are stereotyped as such, generally do not\nappear in the new variety. This can be illustrated through typical vowel realiza-\ntions in Milton Keynes and elsewhere, listed in summary form in Table 6. In\nsection (i), the Milton Keynes children have a vowel that is phonetically inter-\nmediate between those of some or all of the other varieties. Thus the vowel rep-\nresented by price (cf. Wells 1982) is rarely monophthongized to [A], and the\nqualities of the palm, trap, and strut vowels are not as peripheral as the broad\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 85\nTABLE 6.

Indeed, the lack of fronting of the strut vowel in our data is\nsurprising, in view of the fronting that Trudgill (1986:50\u201352) has noted in East\nAnglia, a region to the east of Milton Keynes and similarly close to London. The\nLondon variants of all these variables are found in the speech of some of the\nLondon parents \u2013 though rarely in that of their children, with the exception of\nthose few who are strongly oriented toward their London relatives (the effect of\na child\u2019s network orientation will be discussed under Principle 5, below). Section\n(ii) of the table shows, however, that both London-like and non-London variants\nare found for some vowels. We will discuss the vowels of thought and goat in\nlater sections.\nWe turn now to the vowel of mouth \u2013 the variable (au) \u2013 which shows a par-\nticularly interesting pattern. Table 7 shows the variants that we felt we could\nreliably identify.\nFigure 2 shows the percentage use of the four variants by mothers from the\nsoutheast who attended secondary schools outside Milton Keynes. We have\nnot shown the data for the eighteen caregivers who attended secondary school\noutside the southeast.7 The mothers have been divided into three groups, ac-\ncording to the location of the schools: East London (n 5 2; Fig. 2A), West and\nNorth London (n 5 6; Fig. 2B), and Home Counties (n 5 17; Fig. 2C). For\nclarity, this figure shows the mean frequencies for the seventeen subjects. As\ncan be seen, the two women from East London almost exclusively use London\nmonophthongs or centering diphthongs, while the Home Counties mothers use\na high proportion of [\u00e6U]. The women from North and West London show an\nintermediate usage.\nFig. 2 gives a partial picture of the input varieties with respect to (au). What of\nthe emerging new variety? To maintain comparability, we restrict our comments\nto the speech of females. Figure 3A shows the distributions of the same variants\nfor the Milton Keynes-educated mothers; they were on average just 12 years\nolder than the girls, whose scores are shown in Fig. 3B. Both groups of young\nfemales have a very high use of Variant 4 [aU], almost to the exclusion of other\nvariants \u2013 this is the \u201cnew dialect\u201d of the young females. Strikingly, the majority\nform among the in-migrant mothers, [\u00e6U], is now a minority form among the\nschoolchildren. We shall see that this development is common to much of the\nsouth of England, and is part of regional dialect leveling.\nTABLE 7. Variants of (au).\nVariant 1: [E:] London 1\nVariant 2: [a:@] London 2\nVariant 3: [\u00e6U] Home Counties (southeast)\nVariant 4: [aU] Received Pronunciation\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 29:1 (2000) 87\nA further comment needs to be made concerning the relatively high use of\n[a:@] by the Milton Keynes girls and by the East London mothers: Why is this\nvariant used by both groups, when they do not share other variants? One can\nargue speculatively that [a:@] has different sociolinguistic statuses for adults and\nchildren. As we shall see in the discussion of Principle 8, the children seem to\ntreat the interview as a somewhat more informal event than the caregivers do. If\nso, then the children\u2019s use of [a:@], unlike that of the mothers, can be seen as a\nreduced, fast-speech variant of [aU], and not as a distinct variant with a different\nsocial distribution and evaluation. If we are right, then Variant 4 ([aU] and its\nreduced counterpart [a:@]) has a still higher frequency among the girls than Fig. 3B\nsuggests.\nfigure 2: Southeastern input varieties for (au): distribution of variants in speech\nof in-migrant mothers (interview data).\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n88 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\nIn terms of koineization, what is happening is that the children are faced with\nan input composed of different variants, all of which have particular regional and\nsocial distributions. In principle, none is associated specifically with Milton\nKeynes. They select one variant, [aU], which becomes the main variant of the\nnew, stable variety of the town. Since this is also a standard, or RP, variant, this\nadoption can be viewed as a strategy of neutrality; cf. M\u00e6hlum\u2019s discussion\n(1992b) of a similar phenomenon in Spitsbergen. But, as Fig. 3B shows, leveling\nis not complete, since both [E:] and [\u00e6U] are sometimes used by a number of the\ngirls. The degree and speed of leveling is a topic we will return to under Principle\n7, while further data on this vowel will be used in a discussion of the continuity\nof local dialect transmission under Principle 6.\nPrinciple 3: Phonologically and lexically simple features are more often adopted\nthan complex ones.\nAs we have seen, there is a great deal of evidence for simplification of complexity\nin dialect contact, especially where adult dialect contact is predominant (Trudgill\n1994). Morphological complexity in phonology is found, for instance, in the\napplication of the Scottish Vowel Length Rule (McMahon 1994:61\u2013 62), whereby\nlong vowels are found before a morpheme boundary, as in tied, and short ones\notherwise, as in tide. An example of lexical complexity is the tensing and raising\nof short a in Philadelphia English (Payne 1980), which is both phonologically\nconditioned and lexically irregular.\nThere is little or no evidence of simplification in Milton Keynes. Part of the\nreason is that it is difficult to find clearly complex phonological features in South-\nfigure 3: (au) in the new dialect of Milton Keynes: Distribution of variants in\nthe speech of young women and girls educated in the new town (in-\nterview data).\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 29:1 (2000) 89\nern British English varieties; in any case, there are probably no differences,\nwith respect to complexity, between any of the southeastern mainstream urban\ndialects which form most of the input to the new dialect; this fact is undoubtedly\ndue to the extensive leveling that has already taken place in the region. However,\nthere is a possible candidate for complexity in these varieties. We discuss this\nunder the next principle, which is the individual-speaker correlate of Principle 3.\nT H E M I G R A N T S A N D T H E F I R S T G E N E R A T I O N\nO F N A T I V E - B O R N C H I L D R E N\nPrinciple 4: Adults, adolescents, and children influence the outcome of dialect\ncontact differentially.\nAs we have already seen, existing evidence strongly suggests that different age\ngroups (young children, adolescents, and adults) can influence outcomes differ-\nentially, for a number of social, social-psychological, and developmental reasons.\nThe balance of these influences in a particular case depends on the demographic\nmix of ages, as well as on social network characteristics. In H\u00f8yanger and in the\nFens, we saw that focusing took place only in the third generation; an intermediate\nsecond generation (the children of migrants) showed diffuseness, and the final new\nvariety showed simplification. It was suggested that, for somewhat different rea-\nsons, this could be explained in terms of a social structure not conducive to the rapid\nformation of social networks both in H\u00f8yanger and in the Fens. In H\u00f8yanger, this\nwas reinforced by large dialect differences. In both cases, we can assume that the\nmodified varieties of the adult migrants formed an important input for the chil-\ndren, with the result that the outcomes included simplification.\nIn Milton Keynes, these inhibitory social factors apply to a lesser extent \u2013 at\nleast with regard to the social group that forms the subject of the study. There is,\nas we have seen, a relatively high proportion of children to adults \u2013 possibly a\nprerequisite for rapid focusing. Importantly, information on friendship patterns,\ngained through the sociolinguistic interviews, showed the children\u2019s high interest\nin their peer relationships (Principle 5). If we add to this the fact that the linguistic\ndifferences between the majority of the input varieties are small, then we can\nexpect to find clear signs of focusing already in this generation of children \u2013 and\nwe will provide evidence that this is so, under Principle 7. Before this, we look at\nthe acquisition of an arguably complex phonological feature; it will be remem-\nbered that the appearance of such features after dialect contact may be evidence\nof contact between child speakers.\nThere is, as already noted, rather little evidence of complex features in the\ninitial dialect mix in Milton Keynes, and certainly few differences with respect\nto complexity. One possible candidate for complexity, however, is the morpho-\nlogically conditioned use of a front vs. a back allophone of 0@U0 in words like\nRoland and rolling, as described for London by Harris 1990. It is instructive to\nsee whether, and at what age, it is acquired by children whose parental dialects\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n90 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\ndid not contain it; in so doing, we can judge whether focusing can in principle\ntake place with respect to this feature in the speech of the first child generation,\nprovided there is a sufficiently large number of incomers whose speech contains\nit. In the speech of many Londoners and others in the southeast, the monomor-\nphemic word Roland, along with polar, Cola, solo etc., has a front allophone\n(approximately [ s\u00e6U]) of the vowel 0@U0, while the dimorphemic rolling (com-\nposed of roll 1 ing) has the back allophone [\u00c1U] also found in the basic roll. This\nis arguably a complex feature, since it requires the speaker to have recourse to the\nmorphological structure of the word. An extensive study of the feature carried out\nin Stage 2 showed that the vast majority of the children (35041) did have the front\nvowel in words with the same structure as Roland, i.e. Polo and polar (though not\nin Roland itself \u2013 probably because the name was unfamiliar \u2013 coupled with the\nfact that, in the fieldworker\u2019s (AW\u2019s) accent the word has a back diphthong. The\nfact that all the children had a back diphthong in rolling, roller etc., showed that\nthey had the distinction.\nThe prevalence of the Roland0rolling split should not surprise us, in view of\nthe preponderance of migrants from London and the southeast. However, impor-\ntant information about acquisition can be gained by looking at individual cases,\nespecially those who did not make a clear distinction (including some who were\nnot part of our sample).8 There is evidence that the feature can be acquired at a\nyoung age by children whose parents do not use it. Indeed, all children of native\nEnglish-speaking parents in the two older age groups had the split, including\nseveral whose parents were not from the southeast. This is not the picture for the\nyoungest group, of whom three with non-southeastern parents either failed to use\nthe split consistently, or showed no evidence of it. We can tentatively infer from\nthis that some children acquire the feature after the age of 4 or 5; in fact, we have\nevidence of this in the speech of James, a boy whose phonology was mainly Scots\nat age 4, and southeastern by age 6 (his case of accent shift will be discussed\nunder Principle 6). We cannot, however, draw strong conclusions about any upper\nlimit to the acquisition of the split, except to mention the 9-year-old daughter of\nSri Lankan parents, who had lived in England for only two years, and who used\nthe front allophone in both sets of words \u2013 a pattern found in some RP speakers.\nWhether she has acquired the RP pattern as such is impossible to say. Three sons\nof Ugandan Asian parents show that, in any case, the peer group may be decisive\nin the acquisition of this local accent feature. Two, twins aged 9, consistently used\nthe back allophone for all instances of 0@U0, while a 14-year-old had the split; the\ntwins named only other Asians as friends, while the older boy named mainly\nnon-Asian children, and was in turn named by them.\nWhat of the complexity of this feature? We have suggested elsewhere that its\nacquisition might be aided by an opposing principle, that of morpheme invari-\nance (Kerswill 1996a:196). If so, then its ready learnability is understandable,\nand we are unable to conclude anything about the acquisition of complex fea-\ntures. What close examination of this feature has shown is that, with so many\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 29:1 (2000) 91\nchildren in the New Town learning it from their parents\u2019 dialects, focusing is\neasily achieved in the first child generation, through the willingness of the other\nchildren to acquire it.\nPrinciple 5: The adoption of features by a speaker depends on his or her network\ncharacteristics.\nThe importance of social network characteristics for the transmission of language\nchange has been mentioned already. Essentially, a close-knit network will resist\nthe adoption of changes, unless these changes come via an \u201cinsider\u201d who also has\n\u201cweak ties\u201d elsewhere (Milroy & Milroy 1992). On the other hand, a close-knit\nnetwork will accelerate changes once they have been accepted into it. Thus we\ncan look for a possible link; individual children\u2019s use of features presumed to be\ninnovations may be linked to the same children\u2019s network characteristics, in par-\nticular their integration into a peer group.\nWe base our discussion on the variable (ou), the fronting and unrounding of\nthe offset of the diphthong 0@U0 in words of the goat class, a process already\nillustrated in Table 6. In the speech of most of the Milton Keynes children \u2013 and\nin that of some of the youngest, locally born mothers \u2013 0@U0 has a mid-low, central\nunrounded onset in the region of [<@], [\u00e1] or [ s\u00e6], and a high front or central offset\nwith variable rounding: [Y] or [I]. For London, Wells (1982:309) writes that sim-\nilar vowels have a \u201cflavour of \u2018refined\u2019 Cockney,\u201d and Beaken 1971 reports that\nthese vowels are used only by girls. London is normally said to have [\u00e1 ]\u00e6] (Wells\n1982:308\u20139). Second-element fronting is certainly a feature found among youn-\nger speakers elsewhere in the southeast, and it is probably spreading \u2013 though we\nhave seen no studies of it. Anecdotally, we have noted frequent instances of cross-\ngenerational misunderstandings, such as the mishearing of coke as cake. It seems\nto be paralleled by a similar development in RP, where 0@U0 has long been un-\ndergoing a fronting and unrounding of the first element (Wells 1982:293\u201394).\nWells does not mention the second element, but informal observation of young\nRP speakers suggests fronting and unrounding of this element as well. This gives\nrise to vowels such as [@\n1\nY] or even [@\n1\nI], these vowels being differentiated from\ntheir non-RP southeastern counterparts by the relative closeness of their first\nelement.\nTo quantify the realization of this vowel, the following variants were estab-\nlished, and index scores were allocated as shown (index scores will be used in a\ndiscussion of individual speakers, below). Unlike the variants of (au), the three\nsoutheastern variants of (ou) \u2013 index scores 1, 2, and 3 \u2013 exist on a single phonetic\ncontinuum.\n(ou) 0: [o:], [oU] (Northern and Scottish realization)\n(ou) 1: [@U], [@U\n1\n], [\u00e1U], [\u00e1U\n1\n] (older Buckinghamshire and London)\n(ou) 2: [\u00e1Y], [ s\u00e6Y] (fronting)\n(ou) 3: [\u00e1I], [ s\u00e6I] (fronting and unrounding)\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n92 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\nFor each subject group, proportions of each variant were calculated for individual\nspeakers, and the group means were calculated. For each subject, at least 10\ntokens were transcribed. Table 8 shows the distribution of these variants.\nWe discuss the importance of these overall scores under Principle 8; for now,\nwe note the following:\n(a) In Milton Keynes in the early 1990s, the feature was far more advanced\nthan among London children 20 years previously.\n(b) It affects boys as well as girls, though probably to a lesser extent (in the\nelicitation tasks, the 24 girls had a mean of 63.3% fronted vowels,9 the 24 boys\n49.3%).\n(c) It affects older children more than younger children (a point to be dis-\ncussed below; see Figure 10 below).\nWe now look at individual scores in order to gain an insight into the extralin-\nguistic factors that lie behind them. Our approach is to look at the social profiles\nof individual speakers, particularly the \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d scorers in each group. The\ndiscussion is qualitative, and as such may not be generalizable. However, the\npatterns we detect are fully corroborated by other studies, in particular that of L.\nMilroy 1980 and two studies of in-migrants, Bortoni-Ricardo 1985 and Kerswill\n1994a. The index scale is that given above: 0 on this scale represents absence of\nfronting, while 3 represents maximum fronting.\n(a) High scorers, aged 12. Four 12-year-old girls score between 2.0 and 2.2.\nAll the mothers have lower scores than their daughters \u2013 three only slightly, and\nthe fourth with back monophthongal realizations. All the girls are relatively so-\nciable, with friends in the school. One has extensive contacts with her grandpar-\nents; the other three have no close relations with non-nuclear family members.\nTABLE 8.

Both have slightly older sisters. Neither has\nextensive contacts with the family, but both are popular at school. One cited\nmainly girls as his friends, and was in turn cited by them.\n(b) Low scorers, aged 12. Two girls have low scores of 1.4 and 1.3, which are\nvery close to those of their mothers. One of the girls was described as \u201cshy.\u201d As\na member of a strict Christian group, she has little contact with popular culture.\nShe also has few contacts with her family other than her mother. The other girl is\nalso not family-oriented, but has good relations with neighbors and school-\nfriends. Two boys are low scorers, at 1.4 and 1.2, respectively; their mothers\nscore 1.4 and 0.2. The first boy is a loner and was not cited by anyone as a friend.\nHis parents are Londoners, and he has one younger sister. Other than his parents,\nhe has very few contacts with family members. The second boy is also a loner,\nthough to a much lesser extent than the first boy. He too has few contacts with\nnon-nuclear family.\nA clear pattern emerges from these descriptions. The main factor is the child\u2019s\norientation toward the peer group. All the high scorers (including the 8-year-olds\nnot discussed here) are very well integrated into a (mainly school-centered) group\nof friends; they are sociable and are often cited as friends by other children. By con-\ntrast, the low scorers are somewhat distanced from their peers. There seem to be\ndifferent reasons for this: either the child has a reserved personality, perhaps cou-\npled with poor relationships at home; or, for reasons to do with the family\u2019s be-\nliefs, the child is not exposed to the mainstream of popular culture, and becomes\nan outsider. However, a child\u2019s contacts with non-nuclear family members seem\nto be largely irrelevant to the (ou) variable, since peer-orientation seems to over-\nride all other factors. The fact that it is the sociable and peer-oriented children who\nare in the lead in this change parallels findings made in a rather different context:\nit is not the socially peripheral, lower-class groups who innovate, but groups with\nmore resources and more extensive social contacts (Trudgill 1974:104).\nIt is possible to go further in the quantitative analysis by studying the overall\neffect on the children of the caregivers\u2019 degree of (ou)-fronting. This gives us an\nimpression of the relative importance of parents and peer group. Figure 4 shows\nthe correlation of the children\u2019s scores with those of their caregivers. There is a\nvery weak association between the children and caregivers, largely because of the\ntwo children (4-year-olds) at bottom left. Visual inspection of the remainder of\nthe diagram shows no association at all; indeed, the overall correlation is not\nsignificant. This suggests that, for 8- and 12-year-olds, the principal caregivers\u2019\npronunciation of this vowel has no effect on that of their children. Instead, the\nchildren are generally oriented toward Milton Keynes; differences in their inte-\ngration into peer groups are by far the stronger predictor of performance on this\nvariable.\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n94 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\nT H E T I M E S C A L E O F K O I N E I Z A T I O N\nPrinciple 6: There is no normal historical continuity with the locality, either\nsocially or linguistically. Most first and second generation speakers are oriented\ntoward language varieties originating elsewhere.\nUnder this principle, we look at the time factor from three angles: change in\nrelation to the traditional speech of the area; change between generations after\nthe establishment of the New Town; and finally, change within an individual\u2019s\nphonology.\nThe breakdown of the geographical origins of our families shows that 8.3% of\nthe parents were born in rural Buckinghamshire, while 10.3% had been born in\nthe Milton Keynes conurbation (see Table 3). Some of the latter group had grown\nup in Bletchley; they were themselves largely the children of migrants who moved\nfrom Acton, Willesden, Hendon, Wembley, Harrow, and other parts of the Lon-\ndon area in the wake of the 1944 Town and Country Planning Act, when busi-\nnesses were encouraged to provide jobs for skilled workers away from the capital.\nFew of the sample families, then, had any ties with the settled population of the\narea. This lack of social continuity has led to the disappearance, within one gen-\neration, of several salient features noted in the Stewkley data and present in the\nspeech of our elderly respondents (who would have been in their thirties and\nforties at the time of the SED research): post-vocalic r in words like arm and\nstart; the mid back onset for the price diphthong, giving [OI]; and a raised front\nonset [EU\n1\n] for the mouth diphthong. None of these features occurred in the re-\nfigure 4: Correlation of children\u2019s and caregivers\u2019 (ou) indices.\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 29:1 (2000) 95\ncordings of the children, who seemed to be settling on compromise variants that\nare phonetically intermediate between London English and RP (\u201cfudges,\u201d to use\nthe term of Chambers & Trudgill 1980; see Principles 1 and 2). Moreover, fea-\ntures new to the area \u2013 especially the use of labiodentals for 0T0 and 0D0, and the\nfronting of 0@U0 and 0u:0, which are involved in more general diffusion in the\nregion (Trudgill 1988, Kerswill & Williams 1997, Torgersen 1997) \u2013 occurred in\nthe speech of children and of some parents, but were not present in the older\nspeakers. If we include those mothers in our sample who were born in the Milton\nKeynes area (the northern Home Counties of Buckinghamshire and Hertford-\nshire), we have a cross-sectional picture of four locally born generations. Table 9\nshows the changes between the generations. Note, in particular, the brief appear-\nance of [\u00e6U] in the mothers\u2019 generation (cf. Fig. 2C).\nThe speed of change is evident when we examine the parent and child data. In\nthe cases of the glottal replacement of word-medial 0t0, and of the fronting of 0T0\nand 0D0 to [f] and [v], differences between the parent and child generations are\nstriking; see Figure 5. Although the caregivers used fewer of the non-standard\nforms than the children, possible evidence that a change is taking place in the\nstatus of these previously stigmatized forms can be seen if we consider the care-\ngivers\u2019 data in isolation. Fig. 5 shows that the youngest caregivers (those of the\n4-year-olds \u2013 see Table 10) use glottal stops, [f], and [v] approximately twice as\noften as the oldest caregivers (those of the 12-year-olds). Fig. 5 also shows a\nstriking lack of relationship between the caregivers\u2019 and their children\u2019s scores;\nthe older children are more non-standard (for reasons to be discussed under Prin-\nciple 8), while the older caregivers are less non-standard.\nAs we saw under Principle 4, the ability of children to restructure their pho-\nnologies is crucial to the understanding of koineization. Possibly our most strik-\ning example of the rapidity with which individuals can do this is the case of\nTABLE 9.

The second of three boys whose parents had migrated from Perth in Scot-\nland, he was 4 years old at the time of the first recordings. The family returned to\nScotland every holiday, and the grandmother frequently came to stay in Milton\nKeynes. When first recorded, James spoke Perthshire Scots; but by the time we\ncame to record him for the second time, 18 months later, his speech was similar\nto that of his southern English counterparts. Scots variants had been replaced by\nsouthern variants as shown in Table 11, which gives the majority variants in his\nrecorded speech. By age 6, the Scots variants had apparently disappeared com-\npletely from the speech he used with his peers.\nThere is a similar shift in the consonant system, as shown in Table 12, which\nsummarizes a quantitative analysis of James\u2019s consonants. At age 4, James re-\nsembled his mother in her categorical use of the standard forms [T], [D], and [h],\nand her near-categorical use of glottal [\u00bf] in word-medial positions. By age 6, he\nhad adopted the two merged southern English forms [f] and [v] in full measure; he\nhad begun to drop 0h0, and had begun to use some intervocalic [t], a consequence\npossibly of learning to read (Chambers 1992). For (th) and (dh), it is as if he had\nfigure 5: Use of non-standard consonantal variants in the speech of children\nand caregivers (interview data).\nTABLE 10.

We will see that doing so sheds light on some of the issues raised above.\nWe have noted already that many of the features found in the Milton Keynes\nkoine are also spreading in the southeast generally. On the face of it, this suggests\nthat Milton Keynes is simply part of regional dialect leveling. We now look at\nevidence showing that, even if the outcome is similar, the mechanism is different,\nbecause of the discontinuity across the generations in Milton Keynes. We address\nthis question by looking again at the data for (au). There is strong impressionistic\nevidence that the non-local (arguably RP) variant [aU] is spreading rapidly into\nthe regional speech of the country, at the expense of local variants \u2013 a tendency\nnoted in another New Town, Telford in the English Midlands (cf. Simpson 1996).\nTo test this, we compared the Milton Keynes distribution with that of Reading, a\ntown of about the same size as Milton Keynes, and roughly the same distance\nfrom London. Tables 13\u201314 show the distribution of the four variants already\ndiscussed above. Importantly for our argument, we have had to add two further\nTABLE 11.

In both towns, variants [EU\n1\n] and [EI] are\nused practically as a norm by older people, but are very rare among younger\npeople. We would not expect the same development to be happening in two de-\nmographically such different towns, because of Principle 6: Milton Keynes is an\n\u201cabnormal\u201d speech community in that the young migrant families, in general,\nhave no connection with the old people there. This is not so for Reading; the\nmembers of the working-class sample from which the sixteen teenage speakers\nare drawn have strong family connections in the town, with parents and grand-\nparents for the most part born there (Kerswill & Williams 1999). The distribution\nof variants is very similar, but crucially, they are not identical. Table 14 shows\nthat the old variants are still sporadically to be heard among Reading teenagers \u2013\nreflecting, we argue, continuity in the town. By contrast, in our Milton Keynes\ndata from both 1991\u201393 and 1996, the old variants are totally absent.\nThe data for (au) confirm what we have already claimed about continuity and\nchange in a New Town. In Reading, we see a fairly rapid change from the old\nvariants to the new \u2013 but presumably by a \u201cnormal\u201d mechanism, involving the\nadoption of new variants by speakers who have networks with weak ties.

The children\nhave to make sense of this wide range of imported variants, and they settle on [aU]\n(cf. M\u00e6hlum 1992b). In a new town, there is a catastrophic, creole-like discon-\ntinuity of dialect transmission (cf. Thomason & Kaufman 1988:49\u201350); these\nincomers\u2019 children have little or no exposure to the native variety of the region.\nThis was actually evidenced by the fact that, in a listening test, very few teenage\ninformants could recognize the older accent; see Kerswill & Williams 2000. (Con-\ntinuity and change in Reading and Milton Keynes are further discussed by Wil-\nliams & Kerswill 1999.)\nFinally under Principle 6, we examine the orientation of the child speakers\ntoward language varieties that originate elsewhere. We will consider the variable\n(O:), the vowel in closed-syllable words of the thought set. As shown in Table 6,\nthe vowel varies between a diphthong and a monophthong: [<oU] ; [<o:]. The diph-\nthong is a well-established London variant, also found in other parts of the south-\neast. In Milton Keynes there is considerable variation, with the monophthong\nbeing the more common variant. Figure 6 shows the percentage use of the diph-\nthong for 49 Milton Keynes children. They have been divided into six different\n\u201cregional orientations,\u201d based on their parents\u2019 origins. Three origins have been\nconsidered, in a way that reflects distance from London: London itself, the south-\neast, and elsewhere. The percentage use of the diphthong co-varies with the \u201cdis-\nfigure 6: Percentage diphthongal realizations of (O:).\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n100 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\ntance\u201d from London of the child\u2019s network; if we disregard Group 5, which contains\none subject with a much higher score than the others in the group, then we find a\nperfect gradation from Group 1 (maximal London orientation) to Group 6 (non-\nsoutheastern orientation). This analysis does not, of course, take into account the\nindividuals\u2019 integration into the network (cf. Principle 5); but it does suggest that\nthis qualitative factor (regional affiliation of network) influences language use. It\nalso shows that focusing is not complete in this generation. We turn now to this\nvery issue: the time-scale of focusing.\nPrinciple 7: From initial diffusion, focusing takes place over one or two\ngenerations.\nThe notions of language focusing and diffusion (Le Page 1980) have a useful\nambiguity. The most straightforward view is that focusing refers to linguistic\nhomogeneity in a community, while diffuseness refers to linguistic heterogeneity.\nFocusing of this kind is found in social groups which, as Downes puts it, \u201chave a\nstrong sense of their own identity, a consensus in values and beliefs, and also in\nrelation to the norms or rules which govern their practices\u201d (1984:216). These are\nthe kinds of groups that the Milroys studied in Belfast (L. Milroy 1980). How-\never, their account of focusing is not so much concerned with absolute homo-\ngeneity as with the linguistic norm, and this leads us to the second meaning of the\nterm. In varying degrees, the Milroys found a focusing of norms, or clarity in\nexpected patterns of behavior. The result of this is a clearer correlation of the level\nof use of vernacular forms with social factors, including the degree of an indi-\nvidual\u2019s embeddedness in a social network.\nFocusing in any community is relative; in many cases (such as where there are\nclear ethnic, religious, or caste divisions), diffusion will persist. Diffusion is also\ncharacteristic of socially mobile middle-class groups, as well as among geograph-\nically mobile groups generally. A New Town starts from a position of extreme\ndiffusion and will become more focused with time; exactly how long depends on\nthe social, developmental, and linguistic factors listed above.\nWe have already mentioned the apparent rapidity with which focusing is tak-\ning place in the second generation (first child generation) in Milton Keynes, and\nwe now examine whether this is in fact so. We return to the variable (ou) \u2013 which,\nas we saw, refers to the fronting of 0@U0. Figure 7 shows the association of the\nchildren\u2019s scores (ranked from high to low) with those of their caregivers (the\ndata are the same as those displayed in Fig. 4). Two points should be noted.\nFirst, with two notable exceptions (bottom right on the graph), the overall\nrange of the children is smaller than that of the caregivers, suggesting a degree of\nfocusing. Unlike the children, the mothers\u2019different regional origins are reflected\nin the scores; this is seen particularly in the six mothers who score below 1.0, and\nwho are from the north of England, Norfolk, Scotland, or overseas. Second, even\ndisregarding these six women, we find that, in 33 of the remaining 42 cases, the\nchild\u2019s fronting is greater than that of the caregiver; this suggests that Milton\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 29:1 (2000) 101\nKeynes children, as a group, are taking part in this general southeastern change.\nSome of the youngest mothers, themselves brought up in Milton Keynes, also\nhave high scores, which suggests that this feature has been characteristic of the\ntown for some time. Finally, the discussion under Principle 5 suggests that greater\nfronting is associated with greater integration into peer-groups; this result gives\na \u201cwindow\u201d on the mechanism behind the spread of this feature.\nThe two very low-scoring exceptions are significant. These are the two chil-\ndren who, as we saw under Principle 6, are 4-year-olds of Scottish parentage. At\nthis age, they had not yet accommodated to the majority pattern. This suggests, as\nwe shall see under Principle 8, that the focusing of a new dialect is the responsi-\nbility of older, not younger, children.\nFinally, we return to the question of which generation is able to achieve the fo-\ncusing necessary for a koine. The data for Milton Keynes suggest that the second\ngeneration is already quite close to being focused, though we have noted exam-\nples where this has not quite been achieved \u2013 cf. (au), discussed under Principle 2,\nand (O:), discussed under Principle 6. The restriction here is that, when children are\nfor some reason more parent- or family-oriented, they are inevitably oriented to-\nward language varieties that originate elsewhere (as is the case in Spitsbergen;\ncf. M\u00e6hlum\u2019s work); this is not true of the Reading working-class speakers, for in-\nstance. This will lead to a greater degree of diffusion than in established towns.\nPrinciple 8: Because of sociolinguistic maturation, the structure of the new speech\ncommunity is first discernible in the speech of native-born adolescents, not young\nchildren.\nWe have referred several times to the special position of older children in the\nformation of a new speech community. In this section, we present data from\nfigure 7: Association of children\u2019s (ou) scores with those of their caregivers.\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n102 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\nMilton Keynes which confirm this in full measure, as well as allowing us to see\nthe process behind the focusing involved.\nFirst, we consider three variables whose sociolinguistic patterning in the south\nand east of England is well known: th-fronting, h-dropping, and t-glottaling. We\nwould expect to see the older children gaining in maturity with respect to these,\npresaging the future adult norms of Milton Keynes.\nThe first, (th), shows older children style-shifting more than the younger ones.\nTable 15 shows the use of [T], the standard variant, by caregivers and children\n(the interview data are those displayed in Fig. 5B, though the standard variant is\nshown here). The 4- and 8-year-old children use a low percentage of the standard\nform, and seem not to style-shift systematically. Their low scores may reflect the\nfact that the use of [f] for 0T0 is also a feature of immature speech (see Kerswill\n1994b:75\u201376). The oldest children, however, use considerably more of the stan-\ndard variant in all styles, which must be categorized as more formal than talk with\ntheir peers. They also style-shift consistently. The style-shifting by this age group\nis very much in line with Romaine\u2019s findings for children in Edinburgh (1984:101),\nand it shows the increasing sociolinguistic maturity of children as they grow\nolder. The high use of the standard form by the adults reflects, we think, two facts:\nSome parents were not from areas where 0f0 and 0T0 merge, and the feature is in\nany case still in the process of diffusion in the southeast (see Trudgill 1986:53\u2013\n57, J. Milroy 1996).\nSecond, we consider (h), which shows a markedly high use of the standard\nvariant [h]. Table 16 shows the use of [h] in lexical words (i.e. not function words\nlike he, his etc.). The reason for the very high use of the standard probably lies in\nthe salience of the variable; people are aware of \u201ch-dropping.\u201d All the children\nstyle-shift, with the oldest children using the standard most in the more formal\nelicitation style \u2013 again, as with (th), probably reflecting sociolinguistic maturity.\nLast, we will discuss t-glottaling: the use of a glottal stop [\u00bf] for 0t0 in inter-\nvocalic position. This feature is spreading throughout Great Britain (Trudgill\n1990:78, J. Milroy et al. 1994), with London and Edinburgh\u2013Glasgow as dual\n\u201cepicenters.\u201d Like h-dropping, it is a feature that is also salient for many speak-\ners; but it is increasingly tolerated in careful speech, and outside the word-\nTABLE 15.

However, it is in the oldest age group that we find a high overall use of\n[t] in the elicitation styles, approaching 90% for the girls. We have no directly\ncomparable adult data, but the interview data for adults and children (Table 18)\ngive us a pointer. Here the older children use much less [t] than they do in the\nelicitation styles (Table 17), and also less than the younger children in the inter-\nviews (Table 18). They also differ markedly from the adult group. We can inter-\npret this finding by suggesting that the 12-year-olds treated the interview in a\nrather less formal manner than the adults, even though the adult interviews were\ndesigned to elicit informal speech (see note 6). There are two reasons for propos-\ning this. First, as young adolescents, the 12-year-olds are approaching the age\nwhen their increasing peer-group orientation is symbolized, among other things,\nby allegiance to non-standard speech (Romaine 1984:107, Chambers 1995:169,\nKerswill 1996a). Second, AW, having spent a good deal of time in the schools and\nnursery prior to recording the interviews, had become familiar to the children.\nThe data show, furthermore, that the older children are able to select more stan-\ndard variants in formal school-based tasks, while increasing the range of style-\nshifting by preferring the non-standard variants in the interview. This development\nin the children\u2019s sociolinguistic competence is clearly visible in Figure 9.\nWe can make the following tentative generalization: Children slowly gain\nsociolinguistic maturity in a manner that involves a gradual increase in the num-\nber of styles that are perceived and treated in an adult way. In the elicitation tasks,\nattention is focused on pronunciation, and notions of \u201ccorrectness\u201d come into\nplay. By age 12, children respond to this in an adult fashion, using relatively few\nglottal stops. By that age, however, children do not yet adopt the more formal\nregister used by adults in interviews. Interacting with these developmental fac-\ntors are general sociolinguistic changes in Great Britain, whereby t-glottaling is\nincreasingly tolerated in more careful registers, and formality is being eroded in\npreviously formal situations (something of which we saw evidence in the fact that\nglottaling is used less by older than by younger caregivers: see Table 10, above).\nThis is particularly evident in the spoken media, to which children are increas-\ningly oriented.\nTABLE 18. Percentage use of [t] for (t), interview data.\n%[t]\n4-year-olds 17.2\n8-year-olds 20.4\n12-year-olds 8.6\nCaregivers 40.9\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 29:1 (2000) 105\nThe results presented for (th), (h), and (t) are predictable, given the location\nand demographic mix of Milton Keynes, and given what is known about chil-\ndren\u2019s social and linguistic maturation. As such, the results show that the new\nspeech community is developing along \u201cnormal\u201d lines. However, these changes\ndo not show the direction of the development. By analyzing the sociolinguistic\npatterning of two variables that we believe to be innovative in the south of En-\ngland \u2013 (ou) and (u:) \u2013 we can draw conclusions about this development, and\nabout the process by which it is spread in the new town. We have already dis-\ncussed (ou), which refers to the fronting of 0@U0 in goat. The variable (u:) refers\nto the fronting of 0u:0 in goose, for which there is independent evidence of wide-\nspread fronting, in the southeast of England, in the speech of middle-class people\nin their twenties when compared to their over-40 counterparts (Torgersen 1997).\nFigure 10 shows the use of fronted variants for each vowel for female subjects, by\nage group.11 For both vowels, the figure shows an increase in the amount of\nfronting used by the older girls. Two observations can be made. First, as for (ou),\nthe overall fronting for (u:) is greater for girls than for boys: 46.7% vs. 36.3% in\nelicitation style, a finding significant at p , .02 (MANOVA), supported by Torg-\nersen\u2019s significant result (1997:61). This suggests that, if these are indeed changes\nin progress, young females are leading them. Second, it is the older girls who use\nthe most fronted variants, while the youngest girls match the mothers fairly closely.\nIf we interpret the girls\u2019data in isolation, using an apparent-time model, we might\ninfer that backing is taking place, since younger children have the most back or\ncentral variants. This seems highly unlikely, given that parental orientation and\ninfluence are much greater among 4-year-olds than among the older children.\nThis influence is reflected in the similarity of the adults\u2019 and 4-year-olds\u2019 scores\non these two variables. An alternative explanation can be sought in the relative\norientation toward parents and peers by children of different ages. Thus it is likely\nthat, as the children grow older, they gradually increase their use of fronted vari-\nfigure 9: Percent use of [t] for (t) by age and style.\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n106 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\nants, perhaps with a slightly older child reference group as a model. The likeli-\nhood of this explanation is increased by the fact that it is the children who are\nmore integrated into peer-groups who have more fronting, as we saw under Prin-\nciple 5. We now address the issue of the respective roles of the three age groups\nin the new speech community by taking an overall view of the data.\nIt is possible to gain a global picture of the speech community by entering\nthe results for all ten variables quantified (see above) into a principal compo-\nnents analysis (Horvath & Sankoff 1987). This, broadly speaking, takes the\nscores for all subjects and computes \u201ccomponents\u201d or dimensions which serve\nto differentiate the subjects optimally. The position of each subject relative to\nthe others is then displayed as a point on a scattergram; this allows the re-\nsearcher to identify groups of subjects, and then to interpret the groupings ob-\nserved \u2013 in our case, in social terms. Figure 11 shows the result for the present\ndata, which we have coded according to age group. A number of patterns can\nbe observed. First, although the 4- and 8-year-olds cover roughly the same part\nof the display, it is only among the younger group that we find a statistical\n\u201coutlier,\u201d in this case the subject with the very highest score on Component 2.\nThis is Rory, one of the two boys who, at age 4, spoke with a marked Scottish\naccent.12 His position on the graph reflects the fact that, by this age, he has not\nyet moved linguistically toward his peer group. We should also mention Neil,\nwhose position at the bottom left of the plot (20.55, 20.5) places him at the\nperiphery of his group. This boy has parents from London, and has marked\nLondon features in his speech, particularly a monophthongal realization [E:] of\nfigure 10: Percent use of fronted vowels in goat and goose, by age, female\nsubjects.\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 107\nfigure 11: Principal components analysis of ten variables (Stage 1 recordings, elicitation tasks).\nthe vowel 0aU0. His peripheral position suggests that Milton Keynes children\u2019s\nspeech is not a transplanted London variety.\nThere is a second, much more striking pattern that bears directly on the pre-\nceding discussion: While the 4- and 8-year-olds largely overlap, the 12-year-olds\nappear to have \u201cmoved off\u201d upward and to the right. There are two possible\ninterpretations of this \u201cmovement.\u201d First, we can consider it as representing dif-\nferences between the children that will persist. In this case, we are applying an\napparent-time interpretation, and we conclude that language change is present.\nThe other possibility is to regard the three age groups as representing \u201csnapshots\u201d\nof Milton Keynes children at different ages; thus, the 8-year-olds\u2019 pattern reflects\nthat shown by the 12-year-olds at a time four years previously. This is in line with\nthe conclusion drawn in the discussion of (ou) and (u:). The latter, developmental\ninterpretation seems more likely, for three reasons relating to individuals\u2019 socio-\nlinguistic maturation:\n(a) The style-shifting patterns noted for (th), (h), and (t) indicate adult-like\nbehavior only among the oldest children, suggesting age-grading in the children\u2019s\nbehavior (Eckert 1997:151).\n(b) The data for (au) in Fig. 3 show the same girls resembling the adult speech\nof the young, Milton Keynes-educated women.\n(c) The fronting of 0@U0 and of 0u:0 appear to be well established, but never-\ntheless recent innovations, found only in the speech of younger people; thus their\nadoption by the oldest girls is explicable as an expression of their incipient ado-\nlescent desire to assert their autonomy from their parents\u2019 generation.\nClearly, the age-based pattern observed in Fig. 11 is not unique to Milton Keynes.\nWhat is special is the fact that, in contrast with Reading and elsewhere in the\nsoutheast, the New Town shows no well-established local variety to act as a model\non which these children can converge. Instead, the model is to some extent their\nown creation \u2013 or, more accurately, one created by the very first children growing\nup in the New Town.\nD I S C U S S I O N : O B S E R V I N G T H E K O I N E I Z A T I O N P R O C E S S\nWe have been at pains to stress the dynamic nature of koineization. We were able\nto do this because we were in a position to observe a contemporary example,\nrather than having to infer the dynamics of the process from a completed case.\nThe disadvantage of this is that we do not know the ultimate outcome of the\nprocess in Milton Keynes. However, this is mitigated by the fact that a good deal\nis known about the outcomes of koineization, as our review makes clear. We are\nable, therefore, to compare the process, as we observe it, with outcomes de-\nscribed elsewhere.\nEarly in this essay, we posed a number of questions, the answers to which can\nhelp the investigator explain the path that koineization took in a particular case.\nAlthough we certainly cannot answer them all for Milton Keynes, we have nev-\nC R E AT I N G A N E W T O W N K O I N E\nLanguage in Society 29:1 (2000) 109\nertheless been able to make a number of substantive claims about koineization,\nwhich previously could be stated only suggestively. Mainly, these concern the\ntime scale of koineization. During the first twenty years of a new town, what is\nthe relative contribution of the incoming adults (the first generation) and the first\nnative-born children growing up there (the second generation)? What are the\nsocial and linguistic factors that lead to focusing in the second or the third gen-\neration? For Milton Keynes, we have seen evidence that focusing, albeit not\ncomplete, is already taking place in the second generation. The reasons we cited\nwere (a) the relative similarity of the majority of the input dialects, particularly in\nrelation to their lack of complexity, (b) the high proportion of children in the early\nyears, and (c) the ease with which the children were able to form social networks\nin which new norms could be forged.\nThis high proportion of children is, in fact, quite usual in cases of migration,\nyet it is often overlooked in studies of dialect contact; it reflects the fact that\nmigrants are normally of child-bearing age. Therefore we must seek to qualify\nTrudgill\u2019s claim that, in cases where a great deal of simplification occurs in the\nkoine, the preceding contact involved adults, and that it is their \u201cfailure\u201d to main-\ntain phonological and other kinds of complexity that leads directly to the simpli-\nfied koine. Although adult language and dialect contact was undoubtedly the\npredominant type in most cases of indentured labor (as in Fiji and South Africa)\nand of slavery, it is not true of most migration within the West in the last 100\nyears. The Milton Keynes study shows graphically that, in a case of contempo-\nrary economic migration in the West, second-generation children have a crucial\nrole to play in focusing.\nA critical case for Trudgill\u2019s hypothesis \u2013 that it is adult dialect contact that\nleads to both simplification and relatively late focusing \u2013 lies in Western exam-\nples, such as H\u00f8yanger, where the focusing did not occur until the third genera-\ntion. To explain these examples, we must look not only to the adults\u2019 speech\naccommodation (as Trudgill seems to imply) but also, in the light of the Milton\nKeynes children\u2019s linguistic behavior, to the young children\u2019s strategies. Taking\nfirst the failure of focusing to apply in the second generation, we must seek ex-\nplanations both in social factors \u2013 such as the lack of opportunity for the forma-\ntion of child peer groups in which the focusing can take place \u2013 and in linguistic\nfactors, e.g. great linguistic differences. As for simplification, it is necessary to\ntake account of the contribution of children, simply because they are demon-\nstrably the main agents of focusing in Milton Keynes and elsewhere. Children\npresumably take the diverse adult models as a part of their input; but given the\nopportunity, they will quite rapidly begin to form new, more focused varieties \u2013\nwhich may contain further changes, including simplificatory processes, not fore-\nshadowed in their parents\u2019 speech. Trudgill is probably right in stressing the\nimportance of adult dialect contact in simplification, though the new information\nwe have obtained about settlement patterns in H\u00f8yanger means that the matter is\nless clear-cut. However, we do not yet have the complete picture; further research\nPA U L K E R S W I L L & A N N W I L L I A M S\n110 Language in Society 29:1 (2000)\nin other new communities must now explore the extent to which children of\ndifferent age groups also contribute to this process.\nTrudgill\u2019s discussion of the contribution of older and younger individuals to\nkoineization can be refined in further ways. The Milton Keynes data show very\nclearly that the features of the \u201cnew dialect\u201d there are prefigured by the older\nchildren, those verging on adolescence, and not by the more home-oriented youn-\nger children. This is partly corroborated by the speech of the youngest mothers in\nour sample, who attended secondary schools in Milton Keynes some ten years\nbefore our oldest children; in their speech, they use distributions of the variants of\nboth (au) and (t) that closely resemble those of the older girls.\nWhether, in the end, Milton Keynes speech will differ substantially from that\nof other, well-established towns in the area is in fact doubtful. We have seen the\ngrowing similarity between Milton Keynes and Reading, and we have ascribed\nthis to regional dialect leveling. What is so distinctive about Milton Keynes is the\nvery different process by which this result is being achieved: We have seen an\nalmost creole-like discontinuity across three generations within Milton Keynes\nspeech, something which is by definition absent from the other towns.\nN O T E S\n* This article draws on research conducted jointly by the authors for the project \u201cA new dialect in\na new city: Children\u2019s and adult\u2019s speech in Milton Keynes,\u201d funded by the Economic and Social\nResearch Council, 1990\u201394; ref.

We would also like to thank Marilyn Collins and Ron Brasington for\ninvaluable help with aspects of the statistics and computing for this project.\n1 Here and elsewhere in this article, we use the term \u201cdialect\u201d to refer to any variety of language,\nusually but not always associated with a region.\n2 An important though partial exception to the rule that the process leading up to a known out-\ncome cannot be observed is the \u201cOrigins of New Zealand English\u201d project, which uses a unique set of\narchive recordings (Trudgill & Britain 1997, Trudgill et al. 1998). The project confirms many of\nTrudgill\u2019s predictions about koineization, though the absence of recordings of children inevitably\nplaces a limit on the detail with which some parts of the process can be observed.\n3 We use the term \u201csecond dialect\u201d by analogy with \u201csecond language.\u201d\n4 Voluntary economic migration, such as that taking place in 20th-century western Europe, con-\ntrasts sharply with most situations where pidgins, creoles, and koines such as Fiji or South African\nBhojpuri have arisen (see Siegel 1987, Mesthrie 1993). In such cases, it was mainly adults of working\nage who were transported, with little regard for family relationships \u2013 a factor that may have resulted\nin extensive language and dialect contact among adults, leading to simplification.\n5 Low-lying land reclaimed from the sea, especially in the Netherlands.\n6 The level of informality achieved in the interviews is indicated by the following factors. The\nconversations were based on an exchange of information, on topics which included the raising of\nchildren and experiences of living and working in a New Town. On most occasions, other members\nof the household, including children, were present; and refreshments were served (cf. Labov 1972:85\u201394\nfor a similar approach to the identification of informal speech).\n7 In general, because of the high mobility of the sample families, place of birth is not a strong\npredictor of place of secondary school.\n8 This is a substantially expanded version of the discussion in Kerswill 1996a:195\u2013 6.\n9 The diphthong offsets [I] and [Y] were counted as \u201cfronted,\u201d the offset [U] as \u201cnon-fronted.\u201d\n10 These recordings were conducted as part of the project \u201cThe role of adolescents in dialect\nlevelling,\u201d 1995\u201398; ESRC ref.
