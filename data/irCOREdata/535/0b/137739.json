This has been done by reviewing current theoretical understanding of floc 3 \ngrowth and breakage and an analysis of different techniques used for measuring floc 4 \nstrength. An overview has also been made of the general trends seen in floc strength 5 \nanalysis. The rate of floc formation is a balance between breakage and aggregation 6 \nwith flocs eventually reaching a steady state size for a given shear rate. The steady 7 \nstate floc size for a particular shear rate can therefore be a good indicator of floc 8 \nstrength. This has resulted in the development of a range of techniques to measure 9 \nfloc size at different applied shear levels using a combination of one or more of the 10 \nfollowing tools: light scattering and transmission; microscopy; photography; video 11 \nand image analysis software. Floc strength may be simply quantified using the initial 12 \nfloc size for a given shear rate and the floc strength factor. More complex techniques 13 \nhave used theoretical modelling to determine whether flocs break by large scale 14 \nfragmentation or smaller scale surface erosion effects, although this interpretation is 15 \nopen to debate. Impeller based mixing, ultrasound and vibrating columns have all 16 \nbeen used to provide a uniform, accurate and controllable dissipation of energy onto a 17 \nfloc suspension to determine floc strength. Other more recent techniques have used 18 \nsensitive micromanipulators to measure the force required to break or compress 19 \nindividual flocs, although these techniques have been limited to the measurement of 20 \nonly a few hundred flocs. General trends emerge showing that smaller flocs tend to 21 \nhave greater strength than larger flocs, whilst the use of polymer seems to give 22 \nincreased strength to only some types of floc. Finally, a comparison of the strength of 23 \ndifferent types of floc (activated sludge flocs, organic matter flocs, sweep flocs and 24 \ncharge neutralised flocs) has been made highlighting differences in relative floc 1 \nstrength. 2 \n 3 \nKey words:  4 \nFloc, breakage, growth, re-growth, shear, strength 5 \n 6 \n1. Introduction 1 \nFloc strength is a particularly important operational parameter in solid\/liquid 2 \nseparation techniques for the efficient removal of aggregated particles. Unit processes 3 \nat water treatment works (WTW) are generally designed to minimise floc breakage, 4 \nhowever in reality often this is not the case, with regions of high shear being 5 \nprevalent (McCurdy et al., 2004). This may include regions around the impeller zone 6 \nof flocculating tanks, processes such as dissolved air flotation (DAF) or transfer over 7 \nweirs and ledges and through pumps. Flocs are therefore exposed to a range of 8 \nstresses. Flocs must resist these stresses if they are to prevent being broken into 9 \nsmaller particles. In an operational sense, this is important because small particles 10 \ngenerally have lower removal efficiencies (Boller and Blaser, 1998). Smaller particles 11 \nwill generally settle more slowly than larger particles of similar density. Flocs formed 12 \nfor removal in dissolved air flotation that subsequently break up into many smaller 13 \nparts may be captured less efficiently by air bubbles. In addition, flocs that are 14 \nremoved using membrane filtration will foul membranes if small pieces of floc break 15 \noff and plug membrane pores.  16 \n 17 \nFloc strength is dependent upon the interparticle bonds between the components of 18 \nthe aggregate (Parker et al., 1972; Bache et al., 1997). This includes the strength and 19 \nnumber of individual bonds within the floc. Therefore a floc will break if the stress 20 \napplied at its surface is larger than the bonding strength within the floc (Boller and 21 \nBlaser, 1998). Increased floc compaction is considered to increase floc strength due to 22 \nan increase in the number of bonds holding the aggregate together. Leentvaar and 23 \nRebhun (1983) also list the size and shape of floc microparticles as being an 24 \nimportant consideration for floc strength.  25 \nHowever, the development of a satisfactory technique to quantify floc strength has 1 \nproven to be difficult. This is partly due to the inherent complexity, fragility and 2 \nvariation in floc size, shape and composition and also due to a generally accepted 3 \nview that there are two modes of floc rupture (Parker et al., 1972; Francois, 1987; 4 \nYeung and Pelton, 1996; Mikkelsen and Keiding, 2002). These have been classified 5 \nas surface erosion and large-scale fragmentation. Surface erosion is the removal of 6 \nsmall particles from the floc surface resulting in an increase in the small particle size 7 \nranges. Large scale fragmentation is the cleavage of flocs into pieces of a similar size 8 \nwithout an increase in primary particle concentration. The problem of describing 9 \nstrength arises from the fact that these two rupture modes are thought to be caused by 10 \ndifferent stresses (Yeung and Pelton, 1996). Fragmentation is thought to occur from 11 \ntensile stress acting normally across the whole floc, whilst erosion is due to the 12 \nshearing stress acting tangentially to the floc surface (Figure 1). In addition there are 13 \ncomplex interpretations of floc strength data arising from relative eddy size which 14 \nwill be discussed in later sections.  15 \n 16 \nA review of the literature shows there to be no established standardised floc strength 17 \ntest, although a number of techniques have been evaluated. Floc strength may be 18 \nbroadly considered in terms of the energy required to break flocs under tension, 19 \ncompression or shear (Zhang et al., 1999). However, finding ways of quantifying the 20 \nenergy input for floc breakage has not been easy. There is therefore a need for a more 21 \nthorough understanding of how floc strength can be measured and what information 22 \ncan be found from floc strength tests. This paper aims to review current knowledge 23 \non floc formation and breakage, the different techniques used to measure strength for 24 \na range of flocs including activated sludge flocs, inorganic metal flocs, natural 25 \norganic matter flocs and flocs formed from ionic salts. Particular emphasis has been 1 \nplaced on the applied shear rate, since most previous research has been concerned 2 \nwith this aspect of floc strength. Finally, the review looks at the interpretation of floc 3 \nstrength information. 4 \n 5 \n2. Floc formation and breakage 6 \nFloc strength is directly related to floc structure and is therefore highly dependent 7 \nupon the floc formation process. The combined processes of coagulation and 8 \nflocculation aim to increase particle size for increased removal efficiency of very 9 \nsmall particles, colloids and micro-pollutants. Coagulation is the process of 10 \nchemically changing colloids so that they are able to form bigger particles by coming 11 \nclose to one another. This may be achieved by particle destabilisation by double layer 12 \ncompression or physical enmeshment of colloids within coagulant precipitates or 13 \nchemical reaction or chemical sorption (Cornwell and Bishop, 1983). Flocculation is 14 \nthe process of transferring coagulated colloids into contact with each other to form 15 \nlarger aggregates (Klimpel and Hogg, 1991; Gregor et al., 1997). The exact process 16 \nof particle destabilisation and the subsequent colloid aggregation is complex. It is 17 \ngenerally considered to be a two stage process of particle transport and particle 18 \nattachment (Armirtharajah and O\u2019Melia, 1990). Agglomerating particles must firstly 19 \ncollide with each other and secondly must adhere upon collision. Gregory (1989) 20 \ntreats these steps as being independent and separate from one another. However, flocs 21 \ndo not continue growing and reach a steady state size for a given shear condition. It 22 \nhas been generally accepted that floc growth is held in check by floc breakage so that 23 \nthe rate of aggregation is considered a balance between floc formation and floc 24 \nbreakage (Parker et al., 1972; Francois, 1987; Spicer and Pratsinis, 1996; Ducoste and 25 \nClark, 1998; Biggs and Lant, 2000). The stability of flocs in suspension is therefore 1 \ndependent upon how easy they are to break with aggregate breakage being directly 2 \nrelated to the strength and number of the bonds holding the floc together. During the 3 \nrapid initial formation of microflocs aggregation dominates over floc breakage, 4 \nhowever the importance of breakage increases as floc size increases until a steady 5 \nstate floc size distribution is reached. Thus the steady state floc size is governed by 6 \nthe prevailing shear\/stress conditions within the containing vessel. The rate of particle 7 \ncollision and the nature of the particle interactions are fundamental to the rate of floc 8 \ngrowth (Rfloc) and may be summarised as in Equation 1 as the difference between the 9 \nthe rate of aggregation and the rate of floc breakage (Rbr). The former can be written 10 \nas the rate of particle collision, Rcol and a collision efficiency factor, \u03b1. The factor \u03b1 is 11 \nthe fraction of collisions which result in attachment. Thus the overall rate of floc 12 \ngrowth may be written as: 13 \nbrcolfloc RRR \u2212= \u03b1     Equation 1 14 \nWhen the two terms on the right hand side of equation 1 are equal, the net rate of floc 15 \ngrowth is zero and the floc size attains a limiting value. The collision efficiency is not 16 \nconstant, but depends on the effective shear rate and particle size. For given shear 17 \nconditions \u03b1Rcol decreases as the particle (floc) size increases as the number of 18 \nparticles in the system is reduced. This is another reason why flocs reach a limiting 19 \nsize (Brakalov, 1987). Another important consideration is that floc breakage may be 20 \nirreversible to some extent, so that broken fragments do not readily re-form (Francois, 21 \n1987; Spicer et al., 1998; Gregory and Dupont, 2001). For irreversible breakage the 22 \ncollision efficiency will be reduced and, for completely irreversible breakage \u03b1. = 0. 23 \n 24 \nTo summarise floc formation and breakage, flocculating suspensions are governed by 1 \nthe prevailing shear conditions and will reach a steady state. When the shear rate 2 \nincreases above a critical level flocs will break until a new steady state is reached. In 3 \nsome cases, because of the irreversible nature of floc breakage, flocs are unable to re-4 \ngrow if broken at a higher shear rate. Measuring the shear energy required to break 5 \nindividual flocs or those in a suspension is therefore of high operational importance. 6 \n 7 \n3.  Measuring floc strength 8 \nTwo fundamental approaches have been taken in measuring floc strength; a 9 \nmacroscopic measure of the energy required in a system for floc breakage and a 10 \nmicroscopic approach that measures the inter-particle forces within individual flocs. 11 \nA brief summary of these techniques is shown in Table 1. Due to the fact that the 12 \napplied shear rate determines floc size, most work on floc strength has been in the 13 \nmacroscopic field, using applied shear techniques.  14 \n 15 \n3.1 Macroscopic floc strength tests 16 \nMacroscopic floc strength tests have arisen from the relationship between the applied 17 \nhydrodynamic shear rate and the resulting floc size. Under low shear rate conditions, 18 \nparticles may be encouraged to aggregate, but, under increased shear rate, aggregate 19 \nbreak-up is observed (Mikkelsen and Keiding 2002). Floc size is therefore a dynamic 20 \nequilibrium between floc break-up and aggregation. Gregory (2003) states that when 21 \ncomparing different flocs, the size (or flocculation index) for a given shear rate 22 \nindicates floc strength. Whilst this is the case for the given shear condition under 23 \nwhich the flocs were formed, it does not give an indication of how flocs will behave 24 \nupon exposure to an increased shear rate, as could occur at a WTW when flocs are 25 \ntransferred from flocculators or to higher shear treatment processes such as DAF or 1 \nhigh rate filtration. For this reason, floc strength can be measured by applying an 2 \nincreased shear rate or a normal stress to the formed aggregates and relating the 3 \nenergy dissipation or velocity gradient applied to the maximum or average floc size 4 \nremaining (Yeung et al., 1997, Boller and Blaser, 1998 and Lee and Liu, 2001). The 5 \nmajor problem to overcome with these techniques is the fact that the energy 6 \ndissipation is never homogenously distributed in the test vessel. 7 \n 8 \nThe majority of macroscopic floc strength tests have used impeller-based systems 9 \nwhereby a known shear rate is applied to a grown floc suspension within a vessel of 10 \nbetween 1-4 L volume. However the geometry of the vessel and impeller type varies 11 \nbetween the techniques (Table 2). The breakage behaviour of flocs is monitored by 12 \nfollowing at changes in floc size over a range of shear rates. As can be seen, the range 13 \nof shear rates investigated varies from study to study. The method of floc size 14 \ndetermination is crucial and varies between techniques. It is important to ensure that 15 \nthe technique used to measure floc size does not act to damage the aggregates due to 16 \ntheir highly fragile nature. Most of the techniques listed aim to be as non-destructive 17 \nas possible, although some rely upon taking flocs from the containing vessel and 18 \nobservation using microscopy and image analysis (Wu et al., 2003). However it is 19 \ndifficult to imagine that removing flocs in this manner cannot damage and break the 20 \nfloc particles. The remaining methods have been with commercial particle size 21 \ninstruments that use light scattering to determine particle size (Francois, 1987; Spicer 22 \net al., 1998; Biggs and Lant, 2000) or from analysis of video frames or photographs 23 \nusing image analysis (Leentvaar and Rebhun, 1983; Bache et al., 1999; Bouyer et al., 24 \n2001; Bache and Rasool, 2001).  25 \nThe light scattering instruments measure particle size by passing a laser beam through 1 \na suspension of particles. These techniques rely upon a constant flow of the 2 \nsuspension through the instrument during the measurement cycle (Farrow and 3 \nWarren, 1993). This feature has been harnessed to allow the development of a less 4 \ndestructive methodology for measuring floc size (Spicer et al., 1998; Biggs and Lant, 5 \n2000). These methods have a stirred vessel containing the aggregate suspension and 6 \nare connected to the particle sizing device by plastic tubing. Intrinsic to this type of 7 \nsystem is a requirement to pump the suspension through the optical unit of the size 8 \nanalyser. Spicer et al. (1998) compared 3 types of pumping techniques for delivery to 9 \nthe optical cell: a peristaltic pump, a syringe pump and a hand pipette. They 10 \nconcluded that a continuous recycle using a peristaltic pump on the return side of the 11 \nmeasuring cell was the least severe technique on the flocs and allowed easy 12 \ncontinuous monitoring of the suspension. However, the problems of pumping can be 13 \nremoved by sending the suspension to waste after making a measurement to 14 \novercome any issues involved in a continuous recycle system (Francois, 1987). This 15 \nin itself is problematic as the volume of the suspension is continuously decreasing 16 \nand will affect the velocity gradients within the containing vessel, which will 17 \ntherefore not be constant over the duration of the experiment, so most workers have 18 \nfavoured a continuous loop. 19 \n 20 \nSimilar dynamic systems have been employed using the PDA to give an indication of 21 \nfloc size (Burgess et al., 2000; Gregory and Dupont, 2001; Yukselen and Gregory, 22 \n2004; McCurdy et al., 2004). In this technique, a narrow light beam is passed through 23 \na flowing suspension. The transmitted light intensity (dc value) is measured along 24 \nwith the root mean square value of the fluctuating component (rms). A ratio of the 25 \nrms:dc gives a very sensitive indication of particle aggregation and is known as the 1 \npreviously mentioned flocculation index. The PDA is reported to be a very good and 2 \neasy to use comparative tool showing qualitative changes in floc aggregation 3 \n(Gregory and Nelson, 1986). However, the instrument is unable to give an absolute 4 \nparticle size for comparison with other techniques. In addition, the FI is an indicator 5 \nof both particle size and particle number (McCurdy et al., 2004). As such there is no 6 \nway of knowing the precise contribution of each of these components in the final FI 7 \nvalue. However, aggregate size is probably the over-riding factor as previous work 8 \nhas shown that when flocs grow larger the FI value always increases. 9 \n 10 \nA combination of photography\/video and image analysis has also been widely used to 11 \nmonitor floc suspensions, such that a flocculated suspension can be observed by 12 \ncapturing images of a stirred suspension by focusing on a plane a short distance (0.3 \u2013 13 \n1 cm) behind the wall of vessel containing the suspension (Leentvaar and Rebhun; 14 \n1983; Ducoste and Clark, 1998; Chakraborti et al., 2000; Bache and Rasool, 2001). 15 \nCalibration is achieved by focusing on a graticule suspended into the tank prior to 16 \nflocculation experiments. The advent of powerful digital and CCD cameras and 17 \ncomprehensive image analysis software has allowed much quicker measurements of 18 \nan almost inexhaustible number of different floc size measurements to be made from 19 \nfloc samples (Wang et al., 2002). 20 \n 21 \nFor  measuring floc size, no particle size method can be considered ideal. Aggregates 22 \nare highly irregular and porous and so their scattering patterns  are likely to be very 23 \ndifferent than for equivalent solid spheres of the same material in light scattering 24 \ndevices. Although the light scattering properties of aggregates have yet to be fully 25 \nquantified, Farrow and Warren (1993) conclude that, similar to the PDA device, 1 \nlight\/laser scattering and transmission techniques are good for showing qualitative 2 \n(rather than absolute) changes in floc size for aggregation systems. In addition their 3 \ncapability for measuring a very wide range of floc sizes (20 nm to 2 mm) makes them 4 \nvery suitable for monitoring flocs and colloidal systems, although the expense of 5 \nthese instruments limits their wide-scale application. In the previously mentioned set-6 \nups, the inclusion of the measuring instrument will undoubtedly change the shear 7 \nprofile in the containing vessel and as such may inadvertently affect the floc size. 8 \nPhotographic techniques are good in this respect, because the flocs are only exposed 9 \nto the shear rate of the impeller in the containing vessel and do not have to pass 10 \nthrough a pumped system. The limitations of photography are the time and care that 11 \nmust be taken in preparing complex background lighting arrangements to allow for 12 \nsuitable contrast between floc and background. Furthermore, very small flocs may be 13 \nmissed that are beyond the detection limits of the camera being used thus biasing 14 \ntowards the detection of large particles (Leentvaar and Rebhun, 1983). Bache et al. 15 \n(1999) concluded that floc sizes below 30 \u00b5m could not be reliably measured using 16 \ntheir camera system. This limitation may prevent the detection of floc erosion 17 \nmechanisms as the small eroded particles may be missed by the technique. Masking 18 \neffects can also occur in very concentrated floc suspensions. Given these constraints, 19 \ncare must be taken when comparing floc size data obtained from different 20 \nmethodologies. 21 \n 22 \n3.1.1. Floc strength factor 23 \nOne of the simplest evaluations of floc strength is the calculation of a floc strength 24 \nfactor (Francois, 1987 and Govereanu, 1987). This is effectively the ratio of floc size 25 \nafter and before breakage at a particular shear rate and may be calculated as shown in 1 \nEquation 2 in Table 1. 2 \n 3 \nThe higher the value of the strength factor, the less sensitive the flocs are to breakage 4 \nas a result of increased shear rate and are therefore considered stronger. The strength 5 \nfactor is not a constant and changes depending upon the applied shear rate during 6 \nrupture and so strength factors can only be compared for similar breakage conditions. 7 \nFrancois (1987) noted an increase in the strength factor from 23.9 to 29.3 for kaolin 8 \nflocs formed with longer rapid mix times between 0-360 s and an increase in strength 9 \nfactor from 17.5 to 26.5 for flocs formed with increased slow stir shear rate between 10 \n21-54 s-1. A breakage shear rate of 1396 s-1 for 1.5 minutes was applied in these 11 \nexperiments.  Fitzpatrick et al. (2003) compared the strength factor of kaolin flocs 12 \nand observed the impact of temperature (6-29\u00ba C) on floc strength using a PDA and a 13 \nbreakage shear rate of 520 s-1 for 10 seconds. Whilst the PDA does not give an 14 \nabsolute floc size, the FI value before and after breakage can be used as a surrogate 15 \nfor d(1) and d(2). Floc strength has been seen to decrease with increasing 16 \ntemperature. For example, the floc strength factor decreased from 21 to 14 for alum-17 \nkaolin flocs dosed at 3.4 mg L-1 Al over the experimental temperature range 18 \n(Fitzpatrick et al., 2003). A general trend was seen that showed floc strength 19 \ndecreased with increasing floc size, such that flocs formed at the original slow stir 20 \nthat had a high FI value had lower floc strength factors than those of lower FI value. 21 \n 22 \nA comparison of kaolin floc strength factors for a range of different coagulants has 23 \nshown that hydrolysing coagulants such as alum and polyaluminium chloride (PAX 24 \nXL-9) give lower floc strength than cationic polyelectrolytes (polyDADMAC and 1 \nZetag 64) (Yukselen and Gregory, 2004).  2 \n 3 \nThe floc strength factor allows a relatively quick and easy method of determining a 4 \nfloc strength value and indicates how small a floc will become relative to its previous 5 \nsize for a given increase in shear rate. However, as the breakage shear rate and mixer 6 \ncharacteristics are invariably different between different studies it is hard to directly 7 \ncompare the results other than for general trends. There has been little work showing 8 \nhow the relationship between the floc strength factor changes with increasing 9 \nbreakage shear rate. More work needs to be done in this area to give a better 10 \ncomparison of floc strength using the strength factor and on a wider range of 11 \nsuspensions other than kaolin in order to compare strength values between different 12 \ncoagulated systems for a standardised breakage shear rate.   13 \n 14 \n3.1.2. Shear based floc strength and breakage models 15 \nShear based floc strength models have evolved from strong empirical evidence 16 \nshowing that the final floc size distribution is related to the applied shear rate (Parker 17 \net al., 1972; Spicer et al., 1998). Shear has usually been characterised by the average 18 \nvelocity gradient as shown in Equation 9 for homogenous and isotropic turbulence 19 \n(Camp and Stein, 1943). 20 \nv\nG \u03b5=      Equation 9 21 \nG is the average velocity gradient (s-1); \u03b5 is the rate of energy dissipation per unit mass of fluid (N m s-1 22 \nkg-1) and v is the kinematic viscosity (m s-1). 23 \n 24 \nThe energy dissipation term is given by Equation 10. 25 \nV\nDNP 530=\u03b5     Equation 10 1 \n\u03b5 is the energy dissipation per unit mass of fluid (N m s-1 kg-1); P0 is the impeller power number; N is 2 \nthe impeller speed (rps); V is the stirred tank volume (m3) and D is the impeller diameter (m). 3 \n 4 \nDue to the relationship between the velocity gradient in the flocculating vessel and 5 \naggregate size, Parker et al. (1972) suggested an empirical expression for the stable 6 \nfloc size (Equation 11). 7 \n 8 \n\u03b3\u2212= CGd      Equation 11 9 \nd is the floc diameter (m); C is the floc strength co-efficient; G is the average velocity gradient (s-1) and 10 \n\u03b3 is the stable floc size exponent.  11 \n 12 \nLinearization of the equation allows values of \u03b3 and log C to be found from a log-log 13 \nplot of floc size measurement against the average velocity gradient (Equation 12). 14 \n 15 \nGCd logloglog \u03b3\u2212=    Equation 12 16 \n 17 \nThere is some argument in the literature as to whether the maximum floc size 18 \nremaining in the system should be measured or the average floc size. The initial 19 \nempirical observations relate the shear rate to the maximum particle size (dmax), as in 20 \nEquation 3 (Table 1). Bache et al. (1999) used the 95 % floc diameter obtained using 21 \nan external video camera. This was done to remove problems associated with 22 \nresolution when measuring smaller floc sizes using this technique. However, both 23 \nLeentvaar and Rebhun, (1983) and Francois (1987) concur that the same relationship 24 \nis seen when using average floc diameters. When the values of \u03b3 have been compared 1 \nfor the mean, median and maximum floc size for the same coagulation conditions \u03b3 2 \nremained fairly constant \u2013 between 0.43 and 0.49 \u2013 for all three floc sizes (Leentvaar 3 \nand Rebhun, 1983).  4 \n 5 \nThe value of Log C strongly depends upon the method used for particle size 6 \nmeasurement and which characteristic value of d has been used. As there has been 7 \nwide variation between different studies, Log C can only be used to compare of floc 8 \nstrength within specific experimental systems. However, as the value of \u03b3 remains 9 \nrelatively constant whichever value of d has been used it is a useful value for 10 \ncomparing floc strength and break-up. 11 \n 12 \nThe steeper the slope \u03b3, the greater the reduction in floc size is seen with increasing 13 \nG. The curves shown in Figure 2 are three theoretical examples of different floc 14 \nsuspensions formed at a slow stir of Ginit showing different resistance to floc break-15 \nup. One interpretation of the data is to consider the steepness of the slope as an 16 \nindicator of floc strength. For example, considering line (a) the slope of the line is 0 17 \nand floc size is independent of the applied shear rate. The flocs do not break upon 18 \nexposure to shear and as such must be considered strong flocs. If the slope of the line 19 \nis shallow as in line (b) then these flocs are better able to resist shear than the 20 \nexample in (c). Therefore flocs (b) should be considered stronger than flocs (c) as the 21 \naverage\/maximum floc size does not decrease so rapidly. However, this is likely to be 22 \nan over-simplification of the situation. Many workers ascribe the value of \u03b3  to the 23 \ndominant mode of floc degradation from both theoretical and experimental analysis 24 \nand increasing values of log C as an indicator of increased floc strength (Parker et al., 25 \n1972; Leentvaar and Rebhun, 1983; Francois, 1987). Solving complex equations to 1 \ndescribe floc break-up and turbulence patterns, Parker et al. (1972) were the first to 2 \ntheoretically describe the impact shear has on floc size. These types of models assume 3 \nflocs are composed of mono-disperse primary particles and characterise eddy 4 \nfrequency and breakage capacity. 5 \n 6 \nThe theoretical basis of the value \u03b3  may be explained by turbulent shear patterns 7 \nrelative to eddy size (Biggs and Lant, 2000; Bache 2004). In most flocculation 8 \nprocesses, conditions are generally considered to be turbulent (Francois, 1987; Boller 9 \nand Blaser, 1998). Eddy viscosity is the proportionality factor describing the turbulent 10 \ntransfer of energy as a result of moving eddies, giving rise to tangential stresses. This 11 \nis analogous to molecular viscosity in laminar flow where liquids resist flow as a 12 \nresult of intermolecular friction, therefore, when a liquid moves, energy is dissipated 13 \nin a tangential direction to the moving viscous fluid. This energy is commonly 14 \nreferred to as viscous dissipation. Inertial convection is the release of energy in an 15 \noutward direction, normal to the rotational eddy flow. Levich (1962) described 16 \nturbulence using a scale whereby turbulent flow is described by the velocity and size 17 \nof eddies. Very large eddies are responsible for the mixing of the system with little 18 \nenergy dissipation and therefore do not rupture or break flocs, whilst smaller eddies 19 \nare responsible for most of the energy dissipation. The Kolmogoroff microscale 20 \ndescribes the length scale (\u03b7) of the energy-dissipating eddies (Equation 13). 21 \n4\n1\n3\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b= \u03b5\n\u00b5\u03b7     Equation 13 22 \n\u03b7 is Kolmogoroff\u2019s microscale of turbulence (m); \u00b5 is viscosity (kg m-2 s-1) and \u03b5 is the energy 23 \ndissipation (N m s-1 kg-1). 24 \nInertial convection is responsible for energy dissipation of the larger eddies within the 1 \nmicroscale range, whilst viscous energy is responsible for the energy dissipation of 2 \nthe smaller eddies in this range (Figure 3).   3 \n 4 \nAt high energy inputs, the value of the micro-scale \u03b7 is of a similar order of 5 \nmagnitude to the floc sizes whilst at low velocity gradients it is much larger, which 6 \nhelps to explain why flocs become more prone to breakage at high velocity gradients. 7 \nHowever, it is difficult to say which eddies are responsible for floc breakage as it the 8 \nfloc break-up is highly dependent on the eddy size relative to the floc size. Under 9 \nnormal flocculator conditions, viscous effects dominate (Boller and Blaser, 1998). 10 \nSome authors suggest that when flocs are smaller than the micro-scale they become 11 \nprone to breakage by surface erosion, whilst above the microscale flocs are thought to 12 \nbe more exposed to breakage by fracture (Thomas et al., 1999). Other theoretical 13 \nanalysis suggests that when flocs are in the viscous energy region (i.e. below the 14 \ncritical microscale eddy size) values of \u03b3  of 0.5 have been calculated to indicate floc 15 \nfragmentation, whilst erosion mechanisms are dominant if \u03b3  = 1. In the inertial 16 \nconvection zone a value of \u03b3  = 0.5 suggests large scale fragmentation events and \u03b3  = 17 \n2 suggests surface erosion (Parker et al., 1972). The values of some of the previous 18 \nexperimental work for the calculation of floc strength co-efficient (Log C) and 19 \nconstant (\u03b3) obtained for a variety of flocs are shown in Table 3. Good linearity is 20 \nalways seen between floc size and shear rate on a log-log scale for all of the 21 \nexperimental studies shown in the table. For example, both Bache et al. (1999) and 22 \nBiggs and Lant (2000) had an R2 correlation co-efficient in excess of 0.99. 23 \n 24 \n 25 \nFloc strength coefficient 1 \nFor a fixed shear rate the larger the value of log C the stronger the floc (Bache, 2004). 2 \nAs has been explained, comparing values of log C between studies is not possible due 3 \nto the different impeller\/tank geometries and different floc sizing protocols employed, 4 \nhowever a number of trends can be seen from within individual research. Wu et al. 5 \n(2003) saw that an increase in the polymer dose lead to an increase in the floc 6 \nstrength coefficient for alum sludge flocs. A comparison of ferric hydroxide flocs in 7 \ntap water and sewage sludge showed an increase in log C from 1.5 to 1.9 with the 8 \nauthors stating that floc strength was higher in tap water than sewage (Leentvaar and 9 \nRebhun, 1983). For sewage flocs, it has been shown that adding polymeric flocculant 10 \ndoubled the floc strength co-efficient. Bache et al., (1999) and Bache and Rasool 11 \n(2001) have investigated alumino-humic flocs. In the latter case, a useful comparison 12 \nof flocs obtained from flocculators at 7 water treatment plants treating water of high 13 \ncolour (50-140\u00b0 Hazen) has been made. The value of log C was highest for flocs 14 \nwhere polymer was used and in the instance of water that was initially of high 15 \nalkalinity.  16 \n 17 \nFloc strength constant 18 \nWhilst the value of log C provides a good indication of how strong flocs are when 19 \nthey are formed at a given shear rate, it does not provide information on how flocs 20 \nwill respond to subsequent increases in shear rate. This information can be provided 21 \nby the previously mentioned floc strength factor but also by the floc strength constant 22 \n(\u03b3). The higher the value of \u03b3 the more prone the flocs are to breakage into smaller 23 \nsizes with increasing shear rate.  24 \n 25 \nFor alumino-humic flocs under low alkalinity conditions, the value of the slope varied 1 \nbetween 0.44 and 0.64 (Bache and Rasool, 2001). Looking at the data for comparable 2 \nAl doses (2.4-2.7 mg L-1), the humic floc degradation was reduced from 0.63 to 0.44 3 \nwhen polymer aid had been added. The value of \u03b3 was seen to increase when the 4 \nwater alkalinity was high suggesting that these flocs were less able to withstand 5 \nincreases in shear rate than the low alkalinity flocs. Coagulant dose also has an 6 \nimpact on \u03b3, for kaolin flocs, increasing coagulant dose from 4.02 to 5.02 mg L-1 Al 7 \nincreased the floc strength constant, whilst above this coagulant dose there was a 8 \ndecrease in \u03b3 (Francois, 1987). This suggests that there is an optimum coagulant dose 9 \nin terms of floc strength. 10 \n 11 \nFor all types of floc the values of \u03b3 were around 0.5 (the exception being alumino-12 \nhumic flocs formed in high alkalinity water were \u03b3 = 0.81) . Whilst these values of \u03b3 13 \ndo not highlight major differences in degradation rate for different types of floc (e.g. 14 \nsewage, kaolin and humic), the mode of breakage can be theoretically determined 15 \nfrom the floc strength constant. If it is assumed that viscous effects are responsible for 16 \nmost of the energy dissipation in flocculating systems and the models of floc 17 \nbreakage are correct, then it appears that floc breakage is generally dominated by floc 18 \nfragmentation as the value of \u03b3 remains around the theoretical value of 0.5 as derived 19 \nby Parker et al. (1972). However, this strict theoretical interpretation is open to 20 \ndebate. For example fragmentation and erosion could occur simultaneously in a 21 \ncontaining vessel. This may explain the result seen for the high alkalinity water, were 22 \nthe value of \u03b3 was half way between the theoretical values for fragmentation and 23 \nsurface erosion. In addition, large flocs in an aggregated system may be larger than 24 \nthe microscale (\u03b7) whilst the smaller flocs may be smaller than \u03b7. This has been 25 \nshown experimentally for activated sludge flocs with the d95 > \u03b7 > d50. This again 1 \nsuggests that erosion and fragmentation can occur at the same time, perhaps as a 2 \nresult of the larger flocs in the system fragmenting and the smaller flocs eroding 3 \n(Biggs and Lant, 2000).  4 \n 5 \nHydrodynamic shear based techniques using impellers have been widely used 6 \nbecause of their similarity to operational flocculators and the likelihood that 7 \nhydrodynamic shear stress is probably of great importance when considering floc 8 \nbreakage. In addition these techniques have highlighted differences in how a floc will 9 \nrespond to different increased levels of shear rate as determined by the value of \u03b3. 10 \nHowever, whilst the observation of an empirical relationship between shear rate and 11 \nfloc size is widespread, the problem has been in the interpretation and application of 12 \nshear based models to the data. Whilst experimental work is fitted to these models 13 \nthere is little direct evidence to suggest either erosion or fragmentation is definitively 14 \ntaking place. Ideally, the particle size distribution of a \u2018fragmenting\u2019 floc system 15 \nneeds to be compared to an \u2018eroding\u2019 system to show the differences in particle sizes 16 \nto confirm that the models are totally accurate. A final problem with these techniques 17 \nhas been an accurate description of the shear energy dissipated into impeller systems. 18 \nGav is probably not sufficient enough whilst critical threshold values of Gmax have not 19 \nbeen sufficiently well modelled to directly relate to the resulting floc size. This has 20 \nlead to a number of workers tackling this problem by applying a reliable, accurate and 21 \ncontrollable measure of the energy input and the following section will review a 22 \nnumber of these techniques in turn. 23 \n 24 \n 25 \n3.1.3. Ultrasound 1 \nThe use of ultrasound to condition sludge is a well known technique (Chu et al., 2 \n2001). By applying a controlled ultrasonic field to a sludge suspension, flocs may be 3 \neffectively \u2018exploded\u2019 into smaller parts to improve biodegradability. During 4 \nultrasonic treatment, pressure waves pass through a medium releasing large quantities 5 \nof energy. This induces the formation and collapse of gas bubbles. The result is a 6 \nrelease of energy in the form of temperature and turbulent eddies around the 7 \ncollapsing bubble. There has been some limited application of this in determining floc 8 \nstrength. Wen and Lee (1998) have developed a complex term for the calculation of a 9 \nfloc strength value from an applied ultrasonic field (see Table 1). Above a critical 10 \nultrasonic energy input it has been seen that kaolin flocs and activated sludge flocs 11 \nbreak-up and decrease in size (Wen and Lee, 1998; Chu et al., 2001). A direct 12 \nmeasure of the ultrasonic energy per unit volume of sample can be made that reflects 13 \nthe flocs internal binding strength as the flocs break up. The resulting floc size can 14 \nthen be measured and compared to the original floc size using one of the previously 15 \nmentioned techniques. For activated sludge thickened with alum, the effect of 16 \npolymer addition on floc strength has been investigated (Lee and Liu, 2001). A non-17 \nionic polymer was compared with a cationic polymer and it was seen that floc 18 \nstrength decreased with increasing polymer dose and that non-ionic polymer showed 19 \ngreater floc strength than cationic polymer. The major problem associated with this 20 \ntechnique is the impact of temperature. At an applied ultrasonic rate of 44 Watts ml-1 21 \nthe temperature was seen to increase from 20 to 56\u00ba C in just over 1 minute. 22 \nTherefore considerable temperature control needs to be applied in order to better 23 \nstabilise the system conditions.  24 \n 25 \nWen and Lee (1998) investigated the strength of clay coagulated with cationic 1 \npolymer for different pH and polymer dose. They found that at higher pH and 2 \npolymer dose, the initial floc size was larger. The results were contradictory in that 3 \nthe large flocs formed at pH 7 and 10 were observed to break down at a faster rate 4 \nthan at pH 3 in terms of floc size. However, the binding strength based on Equation 4 5 \nwas observed to increase with both polymer and pH. This is perhaps a reflection of 6 \nthere being two approaches of considering floc strength. The first is a measure of the 7 \nmaximum floc size attained at the end of the floc formation process such that larger 8 \nflocs should be considered stronger than smaller flocs because they have reached a 9 \nbigger size. The second considers the floc strength as a measure of the strength of floc 10 \nbonds to withstand increases in energy once formed.  11 \n 12 \nFor activated sludge flocs the use of ultrasound is confused due to the effect of 13 \nultrasound on bacterial components of the floc. Ultrasound increases the formation of 14 \nfree radicals which can impact on bacterial metabolism and also cause cell lysis 15 \n(Jorand et al., 1995). Therefore, in these instances the applied energy may be causing 16 \nother effects other than breaking apart primary particles within the floc.For water 17 \ntreatment flocs that are generally dominated by non-living chemical constituents, 18 \nultrasonic methods may have potential for determining the forces required to break 19 \nflocs. From an operational sense it is difficult to relate the energy experienced by 20 \nflocs from an ultrasonic field to the hydrodynamic shear conditions that are important 21 \nin a flocculator. However, as inter-particle bonds are being broken in both techniques 22 \na comparison of the results between the different methods would be of great interest. 23 \n 24 \n 25 \n3.1.4. Oscillating multigrid mixer 1 \nBache and Al-Ani (1989) developed a technique whereby flocs are exposed to stress 2 \nin a vibrating settling column. An oscillating plunger was used to provide turbulent 3 \nenergy dissipation in the column. In this manner relatively uniform energy dissipation 4 \ncan be achieved in the horizontal plane with shear stress increasing as flocs pass 5 \ndown the column, therefore the height at which a floc ruptures in the column is 6 \nproportional to a certain level of energy dissipation. A floc breaks when it passes 7 \nthrough a region where the hydrodynamic forces are greater than the binding force at 8 \nthe point of rupture within the floc. The advantage of such a system is that the 9 \nhydrodynamic shear stress at each point in the column may be more accurately 10 \nmodelled when compared to the more complex flow of impeller systems. In this 11 \ntechnique floc size before and after breakage has been monitored using closed circuit 12 \ntelevision (CCTV) and image analysis. The underlying trend emerging from this 13 \ntechnique is for large flocs to rupture higher in the column than smaller floc 14 \naggregates, showing the increased susceptibility of large flocs to increases in shear 15 \nrate. This has been shown for kaolin-alum flocs (Bache and Al-Ani, 1989) and for 16 \nhumic-alum flocs (Bache et al., 1991). The calculation of a value for floc strength 17 \nfrom these data is shown in Equation 5 (Table 1). This has been derived from a force 18 \nbalance between accelerations across the floc at the plane of rupture where turbulent 19 \nenergy acceleration have been defined as 4\/14\/33 \u2212v\u03b5  from Levich (1962): 20 \n4\/1\n4\/3\n32 3\n6\n2\n4\n1\nv\ndd w\n\u03b5\u03c1\u03c0\u03c3\u03c0 =     Equation 14 21 \nd is the size of floc sub-units (m), \u03c3 is the floc strength per unit area (N m-2), \u03c1w is the density of water 22 \n(kg m-3), v is the kinematic viscosity (m s-1) and \u03b5 the energy dissipation (N m s-1 kg-1). 23 \n 24 \nFloc strength calculations have shown that flocs sheared at high Gav values were 1 \nsmaller but had higher strength. For example, flocs sheared at 50 s-1 had a d95 of 238 2 \n\u00b5m and a strength of 0.08 N m-2, whilst flocs sheared at 230 s-1 had a d95 of 120 \u00b5m 3 \nand a strength of 0.42 N m-2. The relative floc strength of alumino-humic flocs was 4 \nfound to change with coagulant dose. For doses of between 2-7 mg L-1 Al, an 5 \noptimum was seen at 4 mg L-1. 6 \n 7 \n3.2 Microscopic Floc Strength Tests 8 \nWhilst macroscopic techniques rely upon complex theory of turbulence, eddy size 9 \nand floc breakage models, recent work has been carried out to gain a more direct 10 \nmeasurement of floc strength by taking individual flocs and finding the force required 11 \nto pull or compress a floc until breakage (Yeung and Pelton, 1996 and Zhang et al., 12 \n1999). The principal advantage of such a technique being that an understanding of the 13 \nmechanisms of how and where flocs break may be gleaned and a floc rupture force 14 \nmay be directly measured to give floc strength. This may eventually lead to a more 15 \nthorough knowledge of the currently poorly-understood mechanisms of floc breakage. 16 \nThe following section briefly reviews two microscopic techniques. 17 \n 18 \n3.2.1. Micromechanical approach 19 \nIn this method, floc strength is measured by the tensile force required to break single 20 \nflocs (Yeung and Pelton, 1996; Yeung et al., 1997). A schematic overview of this 21 \ntechnique can be seen in Figure 4. Calcium carbonate flocs coagulated in NaCl with 22 \npolymeric floc aid were placed in a sample chamber consisting of two glass cover 23 \nslips separated by 2 mm. The force required to rupture the flocs was determined by 24 \ncarefully attaching single flocs onto a glass rod cantilever beam and attaching and 25 \ntranslating an opposing pipette horizontally until the floc broke. The deflection of the 1 \ncantilever may be directly converted into a floc rupture force, provided the cantilever 2 \nstiffness is known, using sensitive micromanipulators. Floc size before and after 3 \nbreakage was determined by averaging the major and minor axis of the aggregates of 4 \nthe original floc and the broken floc pieces. In their first study (Yeung and Pelton, 5 \n1996) floc strength was reported as simply the force required to break apart the floc. 6 \nInitial floc sizes ranged from between 5-50 \u00b5m diameter. In this instance when this 7 \nforce is plotted against floc size no correlation was seen between floc strength and 8 \nsize. A change in floc strength was seen when two polymeric flocculants were 9 \ncompared with the first system having an average floc strength of 64 nN and the 10 \nsecond was 110 nN. Boller and Blaser (1998) have transformed these data into a floc 11 \nrupture pressure so that floc strength is found from the ratio of the rupture force to the 12 \ncross sectional area of the smaller fractured aggregate (as shown in Equation 6 in 13 \nTable 1) giving floc strengths in the region of 100-1000 N m-2. In this way, the size 14 \ndependency of floc strength was again seen, such that smaller flocs showed increased 15 \nstrength. The application of this technique has been taken further to show the effect of 16 \nmixing speed on floc strength (Yeung et al., 1997). A range of mixing speeds 17 \nbetween 50-2500 rpm were investigated for paper pulp with calcium carbonate 18 \nflocculated with polymeric flocculant. An optimum mixing speed was determined at 19 \n500 rpm that gave optimum floc strength of 1,500 N m-2. However, it should be 20 \nstressed that the sampling technique may lead to significant floc breakage or 21 \naggregation, such that the original floc size, and therefore strength, may not be 22 \nmeasured. 23 \n 24 \nThe technique provides an interesting insight into floc breakage in the tensile mode. It 1 \nwas observed that not all flocs breakages resulted in large scale fragmentation. This 2 \ncontradicts hydrodynamic shear models that suggest tensile stress is responsible for 3 \nlarge scale fragmentation. It was hypothesised that flocs were breaking at their 4 \nnarrowest point because it is here that there are fewer attachment sites. The size ratio 5 \nof floc fragments (d1) after breakage with the initial floc (d0) were compared with floc 6 \ncompaction (as determined by fractal dimension analysis). Values of d1\/d0 7 \napproaching 0.5 indicate that the floc has been split into two similar sized pieces 8 \nwhilst near 0 and 1 a floc has been broken into a very small and large aggregate. The 9 \nauthors argue that the mode of floc breakage is therefore more to do with floc 10 \ncompaction than the differences in turbulence stresses and eddy size. Very compact 11 \nflocs have fewer bonds in their margins, so surface erosion is more likely to occur. 12 \nMore loosely bound flocs are more likely to have weak points randomly located 13 \nanywhere across their cross-section and are therefore more susceptible to large scale 14 \nfragmentation. This questions one of the fundamental assumptions of the shear based 15 \nfloc strength characterisations based upon Equation 12 that flocs are homogenous 16 \nstructures composed of similar primary particle units.  17 \n 18 \nThe micromechanical technique has provided a useful addition to the field of floc 19 \nstrength quantification. However, as yet the application has been limited to the 20 \nmeasurement of only a few hundred individual floc aggregates in total and across a 21 \nrelatively narrow range of floc types. More work is required in this field in order to 22 \nassess its broad application to all types of floc. In addition, the importance of tensile 23 \nstress as a mechanism for floc breakage in flocculators and other WTW processes has 24 \nyet to have been fully quantified.  25 \n3.2.2. Micromanipulation 1 \nA further microscopic technique has measured the compression force required to 2 \nbreak flocs between a glass slide and a fibre optic probe (Zhang et al., 1999). In this 3 \ntechnique, a sample of floc suspension was placed on a microscope slide, individual 4 \nflocs could then be selected using a microscope (Figure 5). A 50 \u00b5m probe with one 5 \nflattened end was mounted onto a force transducer and lowered just above a floc 6 \naggregate using a micromanipulator. The transducer then lowered the probe at a set 7 \nspeed until the aggregate broke from compression between the probe and slide. The 8 \napplied force was then measured as the breaking force (Equation 7). The flocs under 9 \ninvestigation were very small latex particles aggregated in a salt solution. The mean 10 \nsize of flocs aggregated by vortexing was 2.5 \u00b5m and the mean floc strength was 5.3 11 \n\u00b5N. However, the experimental procedure did not measure the sizes of the residual 12 \nflocs once they had been broken. This meant the results could not be normalised to a 13 \nfloc rupture force over the floc cross sectional area and so compared to the other 14 \ntechniques. This method provides an alternative microscopic measure of floc size and 15 \nagain needs to be assessed over a range of floc types in order to rigorously evaluate 16 \nthe technique. However from an operational sense it is difficult to think of a situation 17 \nwhere flocs would be exposed to such a compression stress under normal solid\/liquid 18 \nseparation conditions and as such this value of floc strength may not be indicative of 19 \nthe likelihood of floc breakage in industrial unit processes. 20 \n 21 \n4. Comparison of floc strength values 22 \nDirect comparison of floc strength between the different techniques is made difficult 23 \nbecause each technique measures floc strength in a different way giving either floc 24 \nstrength as a relative measure or an actual breakage force. However an attempt has 25 \nbeen made in Table 4 to highlight the general trends that the floc strength 1 \nmeasurements indicate. Table 5 emphasises some of these trends with a comparison 2 \nof absolute values of floc strength from a number of techniques were the force per 3 \narea of floc has been measured. 4 \n 5 \nThe most significant trend to emerge from these strength tests is the increase in floc 6 \nstrength with a decrease in floc size. This can be clearly seen from data in Table 5 for 7 \nalumino-humic flocs with an increased floc strength of over five times with a halving 8 \nof the initial floc size. This is further supported by polymer-calcium carbonate flocs. 9 \nPolymer A produced flocs with an average diameter of 25 \u00b5m and an average floc 10 \nstrength of 100 N m-2, whilst polymer B produced smaller flocs of 10 \u00b5m with an 11 \nincrease in average floc strength to 1000 N m-2. A mechanistic explanation for this 12 \nrelationship has not yet been fully described. However, the reasons are likely to relate 13 \nto floc compaction and the number of internal bonds. In much of the strength work, 14 \nflocs are grown and then exposed to an increased shear rate. This acts to break flocs 15 \nand therefore reduce the average floc size in the suspension. The breakage procedure 16 \nbreaks flocs at their weakest points, which results in smaller pieces that are smaller 17 \nand more compact. This has been shown by fractal dimension analysis of 18 \npolystyrene-alum flocs. There is a large amount of evidence suggesting that flocs are 19 \nexamples of fractal structures (Gregory, 1998, Gorczyca and Ganczarczyk, 1999, 20 \nThomas et al., 1999; Bushell et al., 2002). The floc fractal dimension (Df) can 21 \nindicate the openness of the internal floc structure with a higher fractal dimension 22 \nindicating a more compact structure. Flocs formed at a high shear rate (Gav = 300 s-1) 23 \nwere small and had a fractal dimension of 2.65 whilst floc size increased and the 24 \nfractal dimension was reduced to 2.4 when the flocs were formed at a much lower 25 \nshear rate (Gav = 50 s-1) (Spicer et al., 1998). More compact structures indicate that 1 \nprimary particles may have more attachments with one another or repulsive forces 2 \nbetween these particles is at a minimum. Floc restructuring during breakage is one 3 \nmechanism for allowing primary particles to become closer to one another so that floc 4 \ninternal bonds break and re-form at more favourable points within the floc where the 5 \nattractive force is greater or the repulsive force lower. 6 \n 7 \nSimilarly, compaction is thought to explain why an optimum coagulant dose exists in 8 \nterms of floc strength. For charge neutralisation coagulation mechanisms, the 9 \noptimum floc characteristics should be seen when the repulsion forces between 10 \nprimary particles are low. However, a slight amount of charge repulsion allows 11 \nattached particles to re-arrange into more compact structures rather than attaching at 12 \nthe first contact (Waite et al., 2001). In water and wastewater operations, charge 13 \nneutralisation is generally achieved by the addition of charged metal ions of an 14 \nopposite charge. Increasing or decreasing the ratio of the charged coagulant will 15 \ntherefore reduces or increases the balance of the charge within the floc above or 16 \nbelow an optimum (Bache et al., 1991). 17 \n 18 \nA generally held conception within the water and wastewater industry is that the 19 \naddition of polymer acts to increase floc structural characteristics by aiming to 20 \nincrease floc size, strength, settleability and filterability (Bratby, 1980). From the 21 \nlimited data presented in this review, this statement appears to be at least partially 22 \ntrue in terms of floc strength and size. Sewage flocs and alumino-humic flocs were 23 \nseen to increase in size with the addition of a polymeric floc aid. However, only the 24 \nalumino-humic flocs showed improved resistance to shear rates, implying an increase 25 \nin floc strength. The difference in floc strength with and without polymer is likely to 1 \nbe some reflection of the binding mechanisms of the polymer to the primary particles 2 \nof the floc. For a range of polymers (anionic, cationic and non-ionic), floc strength 3 \nwas seen to decline for biological flocs in their response to increases in shear rate 4 \n(Lee and Liu, 2001; Leentvaar and Rebhun, 1983). No mechanistic explanations were 5 \ngiven although one possible hypothesis was a toxicity effect from the polymer on the 6 \nbiological component of the floc. The polymer may act to kill bacteria or prevent 7 \nbacterial adhesion mechanisms within the floc, thus reducing the overall bonding 8 \ncapacity in the floc through changes in concentration and character or extracellular 9 \npolymeric substances. However, some of this previous research goes against intuitive 10 \nand practical experience of polymers used in water and wastewater treatment. Much 11 \nmore work is required in this field to more adequately quantify the effects of 12 \npolymeric flocculants.  13 \n 14 \nDuring the removal of solid particles, enmeshment and bridging of particles within 15 \nthe precipitated coagulant matrix are thought to be the principal binding forces 16 \nholding the floc together. These types of bond are considered much stronger than van 17 \nder Waals attractive forces formed during charge neutralisation (Bache et al., 1997). 18 \nThis is supported by the experimental data shown in Table 5. From the available data, 19 \nthere are considerable differences in floc strength for different types of aggregate. 20 \nFlocs composed of coagulant and particles were one to two orders of magnitude 21 \nstronger than charge neutralisation flocs.  22 \n 23 \nFlocs formed from waters of high colour and high natural organic matter (NOM) 24 \ncontent are widely recognised as being fragile structures when compared to other 25 \nflocs (Bache et al., 1997). The floc strength data available confirm this, with these 1 \nflocs being weaker than flocs formed by charge neutralisation at their isoelectric point 2 \n(IEP). The weakness of humic flocs is explained by Bache et al. (1999) to be due to 3 \nthe fact that charge neutralisation is the main removal route NOM removal preventing 4 \nstronger bridging bonds from forming. This in part explains the weakness of organic 5 \nflocs but does not help explain why IEP flocs are considerably stronger than humic 6 \nflocs. If both flocs are formed by charge neutralisation, then van der Waals forces 7 \nbetween primary particles will dominate. The reduced floc strength of humic flocs 8 \ntherefore suggests an increased degree of repulsion within the floc matrix. This makes 9 \nsense because organic matter is a complex mixture of different organic compounds 10 \n(Goslan et al., 2002). These organic molecules have differing degrees of charge and 11 \nhydrophobicity (O\u2019Melia et al., 1999). Therefore, whilst some molecules and parts of 12 \nmolecules may be effectively charge neutralised by coagulants, regions of similarly 13 \ncharge will exist that increase repulsion within the floc. 14 \n 15 \n5. Conclusions 16 \nThere have been a number of different approaches taken in measuring floc strength. 17 \nSome workers consider that floc strength is indicated by the size a floc reaches at the 18 \nend of its growth phase, whilst others consider the force required to break already 19 \nformed flocs. 20 \n 21 \nMost research has concentrated on exposing flocs to increased shear rate in a 22 \ncontaining vessel by the application of stirring, ultrasonification and oscillation. More 23 \nrecently microscopic techniques have been developed that relate the energy required 24 \nto pull apart or compress individual flocs until breakage. 25 \nWhilst there is strong evidence showing an empirical relationship between the applied 1 \nshear rate and the final floc size distribution, there are a number of problems 2 \nassociated with comparing the data from one study to another. The interpretations of 3 \nfloc breakage models need to be further analysed. These models ascribe floc breakage 4 \nas either erosion or fragmentation based upon the rate of floc breakage with 5 \nincreasing shear rate relative to the eddy size in the system. These interpretations are 6 \nopen to debate given the incomplete understanding of how eddies interact with flocs 7 \nduring floc breakage. Different impeller geometries and containing vessels give rise 8 \nto different shear patterns and maximum shear levels experienced by flocs that result 9 \nin different floc breakage behaviour. For this reason a simple consideration of how 10 \nfloc size changes relative to its initial size may give the best global indication of how 11 \nstrong flocs are. 12 \n 13 \nSome general trends have emerged from floc strength tests that show that floc 14 \nstrength increases with decreasing floc size. The addition of polymer decreased floc 15 \nstrength for biological flocs and increased floc strength for chemical flocs. 16 \n 17 \nFloc strength is a difficult parameter to measure accurately due to the inherent 18 \nfragility and complexity of floc structures. As yet, there is no detailed understanding 19 \nof the internal composition and bonding that occurs within a floc aggregate such as 20 \nthe number of bonds, locations of points of attachment and internal attractive and 21 \nrepulsive forces within the structure. Therefore many of the floc strength and 22 \nbreakage models developed so far have not reached a thorough mechanistic level.23 \n6. References 1 \nAmirtharajah, A. and O'Melia, C.R.
