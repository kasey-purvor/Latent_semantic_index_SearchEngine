INTRODUCTION\nDespite a great deal of recent effort from both the experi-\nmental and theoretical sides, the N<Z nuclei of the mass\n,80 region remain relatively poorly understood, especially\nfor the high spin states. This nuclear region exhibits a num-\nber of interesting phenomena, such as rapid structure\nchanges (particle alignments, shape changes and shape coex-\nistence) with changing mass number and angular momen-\ntum, and the possibility to search for the experimental signal\nof enhanced neutron-proton snpd correlations, especially in\nthe pairing channel (both T=1 and T=0 modes). The most\nnatural systems to study these np correlations are the N=Z\nnuclei (the heaviest ones in particular) in which neutrons and\nprotons occupy the same orbitals, and thus have the largest\nprobability to form np pairs. Various calculations differ on\nthe role played by the np correlation, nevertheless, for the\neven-even N=Z nuclei one of the most conspicuous pre-\ndicted effects is its influence on the band crossing, resulting\nin a delay of the crossing frequency at which the particle-\nalignment takes place.\nA systematic delay of the alignment frequency (compared\nto the N.Z nuclei from the same mass region) appears to\noccur for all even-even nuclei from 72Kr to 88Ru [1\u20134], al-\nthough the backbending has not yet been observed in any of\nthe nuclei above 72Kr. In 72Kr a delayed alignment was re-\nported for the ground state band [1], and thought initially to\nbe the effect of np pairing. More detailed subsequent studies\nof its band structures (Refs. [2,5\u20137]) have revealed a com-\nplex shape coexistence phenomenon in this nucleus. The\nanalysis of Ref. [7] seems to rule out the need to invoke T\n=0 np pairing, and actually shows how difficult and delicate\nis the task of observing the possible effects of the np pairing,\nparticularly in nuclei with shape coexistence. In heavier N\n=Z nuclei sA<80d one has a well defined prolate shape.\nCompetition with other shapes thus becomes less important.\nHowever, due to experimental difficulties, higher spin states\nin these nuclei have not yet been measured. It is therefore of\ninterest to study experimentally other, more accessible sys-\ntems, where shape coexistence phenomena are less probable.\nIn principle, the structure of the N<Z nuclei should also\nbe influenced by the np correlations, although this influence\ndiminishes rapidly as Tz increases. The N=Z+1 nuclei,\nwhich are the closest to the N=Z line, are obviously the best\navailable probes and are easier to study since they are popu-\nlated with larger cross sections.\nPrevious studies of the N=Z+1 nuclei in the heavier re-\ngion, 75Rb [8] and 79Y [9], have addressed the problem of np\npairing, and have shown that conventional TRS calculations\n(with only standard T=1 like-nucleon pairing) explain the\navailable data (moments of inertia of two bands) rather well.\nAnother study of a N=Z+1 nucleus, 73Kr [10], has revealed\na particular high spin behavior of one of its rotational bands\nwhich may indicate an effect of the T=0 np pairing, al-\nthough this interpretation is not completely unambiguous.\nOne may characterize the situation of the present under-\nstanding of the N<Z nuclei as follows.\nIn the region of the heavier N,Z nuclei, the TRS calcu-\nlations are generally successful in predicting crossing fre-\nquencies in the nuclei not too close to the N=Z line. This\nmay suggest that the np pairing is not very important in such\nnuclei. For the N=Z nuclei the scarcer data do not allow a\ndefinite conclusion.\nIn principle, T=0 np pairing interactions may survive at\nhigher spins because they are not influenced by the Coriolis\nanti-pairing effect. Nevertheless, it has been argued [11] that\nPHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 054301 (2004)\n0556-2813\/2004\/69(5)\/054301(9)\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society69 054301-1\nthe effects of such interactions might not show up in the\nexperimental data.\nUnambiguous conclusions are difficult to draw because\ndetails of the crossing frequencies and of the rotational align-\nments depend on many other factors, such as shape changes\nand\/or shape coexistence, as well as triaxiality. In addition,\ndeformations in these nuclei have been studied only theoreti-\ncally, and have not been confirmed experimentally. The\nsingle particle energies, which often affect the quality of pre-\ndicted spectra, are not optimized in this exotic mass region.\nFor the even-even N=Z nuclei the theoretical calculations\nagree on a possible unique signature of the np pairing corre-\nlations, which defines a clear effect that must be searched\nfor: a delayed band crossing. Such a consensus is missing for\nthe N=Z+1 odd-A nuclei. From the theoretical point of view,\nit is not clear at present what is the true nature of the np\ncorrelations in nuclei near the N=Z line and how these are\nrevealed in different configurations in the rotational spec-\ntrum. Consequently, it is important to map better experimen-\ntally the structure of the N=Z+1 nuclei around mass 80.\nThe higher spin states in the back-bending region of in-\nterest are not known for any N=Z+1 nuclei above 77Sr. The\nobservation of multiple bands with different single-particle\norigins, in the same nucleus, is also important. The present\nwork is devoted to the study of the 81Zr nucleus, and reports\nfor the first time three rotational band structures observed in\na N=Z+1 nucleus with mass above 80. The crossing fre-\nquencies have been identified for two of these bands. The\nbands are first compared with those observed in the isotonic\nnucleus 79Sr, and then are discussed in the framework of the\nprojected shell model.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nA. Level scheme of 81Zr\nExcited states in the 81Zr nucleus were first reported by\nour group in Ref. [12]. We have repeated measurements with\nthe same reaction, 58Ni+ 28Sis90 MeVd, with the main pur-\npose of expanding the ground state band (gsb) of 84Mo [3].\nThe experimental setup comprised the Ge array GASP, the\ncharged particle ball ISIS, and the neutron detectors n-ring,\nwhose performances were mentioned in Refs. [3,4]. In the\nnewer experiment the target consisted of a stack of two\n0.5 mg\/cm2 58Ni foils. The g -g -g coincidence data has\nbeen added to the similar ones of the older experiment [12],\nthus resulting in increased statistics. Two improvements in\nthe measurements have allowed a significant extension of the\nlevel scheme of 81Zr (reached by the an channel). The first\nwas the addition of the neutron detection. By studying the\ncoincidences of the g-rays with both charged particles and\nneutrons, one could find a new band structure clearly as-\nsigned to 81Zr. The second improvement was a careful en-\nergy calibration of the Silicon particle detector telescopes of\nISIS; this allowed a good kinematic correction of the Dop-\npler broadening of the g-rays, resulting in a better energy\nresolution.\nFigure 1 shows the level scheme deduced from the\npresent experiment, which updates the older scheme from\nRef. [12]. Relative intensities of the g-rays and information\non the multipolarity of transitions, when possible, are given\nin Table I. Examples of spectra showing the three band struc-\ntures in 81Zr as determined from the summed data of the two\nexperiments are given in Fig. 2.\nThe two band structures (labeled as f422g5\/2+ and\nf301g3\/2\u2212) observed in Ref. [12] have been confirmed and\ncan be followed to higher spins in both signatures. As Table\nI shows, the angular distribution Legendre polynomial coef-\nficients determined for the lower, stronger transitions, show\nclear dipole or quadrupole character. Assuming that these\nrepresent M1 or E2 transitions, and using (as in Ref. [12])\nthe strong similarity of these bands with those in 79Sr\n[13,14], the spins and parities shown in both Fig. 1 and Table\nI are tentatively proposed.\nBoth signatures for the newly added band structure (la-\nbeled f431g1\/2+ in Fig. 1) have been observed. The angular\ndistribution data for transitions in this band could not be\nanalyzed due to the much smaller intensity of this band com-\npared to that of the other two bands. The tentative spin and\nparity values of this new band structure have been proposed\non the basis of its strong similarity to the f431g1\/2+ band\nknown in the 79Sr [13] and 81Sr [15,16] neighboring nuclei.\nThe two transitions of 133 and 192 keV below this band\nstructure have been observed with reduced intensity when\ngating on higher transitions in the two bands, an indication of\nthe fact that both the s1\/2+d and s3\/2+d states have long\nlifetimes of the order of tens of ns. Most of the nuclei popu-\nlated in these states decay after recoiling out of the center of\nGASP. A similar reduction in intensity has been found for the\ncase of a known isomeric state in 79Sr (177 keV, 5\/2+, with\na lifetime of 20 ns) [14,17], observed with GASP in the re-\naction 58Ni+ 24Mgs90 MeVd. It has been assumed that the\ntransitions of 133 and 192 keV feed the 3\/2\u2212 ground state\n[20]. The lifetimes of the 133 keV and 192 keV states have\nbeen estimated by comparing the experimental ratio between\nthe intensity observed below and above the isomeric state,\nwith the corresponding calculated ratio, in which the detec-\ntion efficiency of GASP for the isomeric decay has been\nintegrated over the whole recoiling path of the nuclei in a\nMonte Carlo simulation (similar to the recoil shadow aniso-\ntropy method [21]). From a spectrum gated by the 462 and\n910 keV transitions, a value of 0.11(5) has been deduced for\nthe intensity ratio of the 133 and 237 keV transitions deex-\nciting and feeding, respectively, the 133 keV state. A similar\nvalue has been derived for the corresponding intensity ratio\nat the 192 keV state, however with a larger error due to the\nunknown contribution of the possible (unobserved) transition\nof 59 keV from the 192 keV state to the 133 keV state.\nThese low precision intensity ratios allowed us to establish a\nlower limit of about 40 ns for the lifetimes of the 133 and\n192 keV states.\nFor the f422g5\/2+ band, no transitions to the other two\nbands were found. Also, no transitions below the 303.3 keV\ntransition were observed, which is an indication of low ex-\ncitation energy and\/or a longer lifetime of the 5\/2+ state.\nThis was left as a floating band, as in our previous work [12].\nB. Level scheme of 79Sr\nThe level scheme of 79Sr has been previously investigated\nby heavy-ion reactions, leading to the observation of the\nM\u02c6RGINEAN et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 054301 (2004)\n054301-2\nthree band structures mentioned above [13,14,17]. Data from\na previous experiment that we performed with the GASP\narray and the 58Ni+ 24Mg reaction at 90 MeV [18] has made\nit possible to considerably extend the level scheme. Here we\npresent only results relevant to the 81Zr study. The complete\nresults will be provided in a forthcoming publication [19]. Of\ninterest for this work are the transitions added in the upper\npart of the three band structures. Figure 3 presents these\nthree bands, which have all been extended to higher spins\ncompared to the previous available data [13,14]. The ob-\nserved high spin behavior will be discussed below in com-\nparison with that of 81Zr.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nA. Qualitative discussion of band behavior\nThe Nilsson single-particle level scheme shows two large\ngaps at a quadrupole deformation of b2,0.4 for nucleon\nnumbers 38 and 40 [22]. At these large deformations, the\nNilsson orbitals close to the Fermi level of our nuclei are\nf422g5\/2+, f301g3\/2\u2212 and f431g1\/2+. These orbitals should\ntherefore dominate the structure of the low-lying bands.\nBands based on these three orbitals have been found in 79Sr\n[13,14] and 81Sr [16]. The three bands observed now in 81Zr\ncorrespond also to these three assignments.\nIn this section we compare the rotational behavior of the\nthree bands of 81Zr with that of the similar bands of 79Sr, as\nwell as with that of the yrast bands (gsb) of the neighboring\neven-even nuclei. Figure 4 shows the dynamic moments of\ninertia sJs2dd of these bands as a function of rotational fre-\nquency. Js2d has been chosen for this comparison because this\nquantity is very sensitive to the details of the alignments\ntaking place along the bands. The f422g5\/2+ band in 81Zr is\nextremely similar to the gsb of 82Zr, showing the sharp align-\nment of the g9\/2 proton pair at a frequency close to 0.6 MeV.\nThe f301g3\/2\u2212 and f431g1\/2+ bands, on the other hand, fol-\nlow very closely (in their lower part) the evolution of the gsb\nof 80Zr (known, unfortunately, only up to about \"v\n=0.55 MeV. The f301g3\/2\u2212 band shows the proton pair\nalignment around 0.6 MeV. In 79Sr, we observe a similar\nFIG. 1. Level scheme of 81Zr\nas observed in our experiments.\nThis level scheme supersedes that\nof Ref. [12].

Figure 4 suggests that the\nf301g3\/2\u2212 and f431g1\/2+ bands in these nuclei follow\nclosely the behavior of the even-even core with one less\nneutron. This is very interesting in the case of N=Z+1 nu-\nclei, in view of the scarcity of data for the N=Z even-even\nnuclei, in which the alignment patterns are yet to be ob-\nserved.\nOne should note the striking behavior of the f431g1\/2+\nband of 81Zr at higher spins (Fig. 4). While in 79Sr this band\nbehaves roughly like the f301g3\/2\u2212 band and is very similar\nto the 78Sr gsb, in 81Zr no trace of alignment is found up to a\nfrequency of about 0.68 MeV or maybe even higher, unlike\nthe one seen in the f301g3\/2\u2212 band. This band behaves like a\nrather rigid, rotational band (its Js2d values are almost con-\nstant and equal to the Js1d ones), up to the highest observed\nfrequency. It remains a challenge to explain why the g9\/2\nproton pair alignment is absent or much delayed in the\nf431g1\/2+ band of 81Zr. The decoupling parameter a of this\nrotational K=1\/2 band, as determined from the energies of\nthree consecutive levels with DJ=1, is almost constant, vary-\ning from about \u22120.30 to \u22120.43 for the spin values between\n5\/2 and 23\/2, thus having an average value of a=\u22120.38s6d\nin this spin interval. This value corresponds to an almost\nmaximum mixing between the spherical orbitals d5\/2 and g7\/2\nin the Nilsson wavefunction f431g1\/2+, with C7\/2\n2\n=0.483s8d.\nBy comparison, in the same spin interval, the decoupling\nparameter of the f431g1\/2+ band in 79Sr is a=\u22120.19s2d,\nwhich leads to a smaller occupation of the g7\/2 orbital, C7\/2\n2\n=0.455s3d. The larger mixing observed in 81Zr indicates a\nlowering of the g7\/2 orbital with respect to the d5\/2 one,\nwhich may be an indication of an increased np interaction.\nB. Comparison with projected shell model calculation\n1. The model\nIn order to understand the rotational behavior of the ob-\nserved band structures we have performed projected shell\nmodel (PSM) [23] calculations. The PSM has been exten-\nsively applied for a systematical study on the even-even N\n=Z ,Z+2 and Z+4 Kr, Sr, and Zr nuclei [24], as well as the\nodd-odd N=Z ,Z+2 and Z+4 Br, Rb, and Y nuclei [25]. De-\ntailed analysis for the N=Z Kr, Sr, and Zr [26] and Mo and\nRu nuclei [3] has also been carried out by the PSM. A sys-\ntematic discussion can be found in Ref. [27]. In addition, we\nhave applied the PSM to the interpretation of the structure of\nan N=Z+1 nucleus from this mass region, 85Mo [28]. How-\never, except in the 85Mo study, most of the previous PSM\ncalculations in this mass region were restricted to the prop-\nerties of the yrast band.\nCalculations in terms of a spherical shell model for nuclei\ndiscussed in the present paper are not feasible. It is a big\nadvantage for the PSM to use the deformed single particle\nbasis supplemented with angular momentum projection. In\nthis sense, the PSM is a shell model which employs a shell\nmodel space constructed in the deformed Nilsson basis [23].\nDiagonalization at given angular momenta mixes various\nK-states originally from the Nilsson orbitals. The PSM is\nthus capable of describing the dynamical evolution along a\nrotational band such as particle alignment, giving rise to the\nTABLE I.

Comparison with the data\nThe results from the PSM calculations are compared to\nthe experimental data in Fig. 5, in a plot of the kinetic mo-\nment of inertia vs rotational frequency. Overall, the calcula-\ntions describe reasonably well the bands observed in 81Zr.\nThe back-bending observed in the f422g5\/2+ band at a fre-\nquency of 0.55\u20130.6 MeV is rather well reproduced. The\nng9\/2 orbital is blocked in this band. The back-bending is\nfound to be due to the alignment of a pair of g9\/2 protons.\nThe detailed PSM analysis shows that the proton qp pair\nfrom g9\/2 with K=3\/2 and 5\/2 coupled to K=1 are involved\nin the alignment process. The f301g3\/2\u2212 experimental data\nshow the beginning of an up-bending just after 0.6 MeV,\nwhich is also correctly predicted by the PSM. The calcula-\ntions suggest also that a band-crossing starts to develop in\nthe f431g1\/2+ band at frequencies around 0.7 MeV.\nOn the other hand, the calculated moments of inertia for\nthe f301g3\/2\u2212 and f431g1\/2+ bands are about 20% too low in\nthe low-spin region as compared with the data. One might\nthink that these two bands correspond to larger deformations\nthan the f422g5\/2+ band. However, calculations in which the\nprojected basis is built at larger quadrupole deformations (up\nto \u00ab2 5 0.36) do not significantly improve the results for\nthese two bands. The fact that the PSM approach with the\nsame effective interactions and configuration space has\nworked reasonably well for the yrast bands in many nuclei in\nthis mass region [24,25,27], but now cannot account equally\nwell for all the bands in one nucleus (in the 85Mo study [28],\nthe agreement for the negative parity band was also found\nworse than for the positive parity band), may indicate that\nthere is something missing in the model. The most probable\nmissing ingredient in the PSM could be the np correlations.\nAs already mentioned, theoretical investigations have\nsuggested that the np correlations are important in the dis-\ncussion of the rotational properties in N,Z nuclei. Now the\nresults discussed above may further suggest that the interac-\ntion does not equally affect the rotational behavior of various\nbands in the same nucleus. For example, the simultaneous\noccurrence of neutron and proton high-j pairs (here the g9\/2\nneutrons and protons) in the shell model configuration im-\nplies that the np type interaction can be significant in the\nshell model states. If the np correlation is not properly con-\nstructed in a model, a good description cannot be expected.\nIn the present version of the PSM theory, the np residual\ninteraction is allowed only in the quadrupole-quadrupole\nchannel, but not in the pairing channel (see discussions in\nFIG. 4.

[26]). The current parameterization somehow favors a\ngood description for the f422g5\/2+ band, but it is not as good\nfor the others.\nThis may pose an interesting question with regard to the\ncurrent understanding and treatment of the np interaction for\nthe N,Z nuclei. It was argued [30] that by applying the\nconcept of spontaneous breaking of the isospin invariance,\nthe neutron-proton interaction can be effectively considered\nin a theory with only neutron-neutron and proton-proton\npairings, since one has a freedom to choose one particular\ndirection in the isospin space. This means that with the renor-\nmalized pairing interactions between the like-nucleons in an\neffective Hamiltonian, one may be able to account for the\nT=1 part of the proton-neutron pairing. In fact, the previous\nPSM calculations for N=Z nuclei have employed this con-\ncept implicitly [24,25]. However, the discussions here indi-\ncate that the renormalization that mimics the np pairing may\nnot work equally well for all bands within one nucleus. The\nuse of the extended quadrupole plus pairing force [31] that\ncontains an isospin-invariant pairing may be helpful in un-\nderstanding the problem.\n81Zr is a N=Z+1 nucleus that is a direct neighbor of the\nN=Z line. As one can see in Fig. 5, for 79Sr sN=Z+3d, with\nthe exception of the band crossing region in the f422g5\/2+\nband, the behavior of all three bands is well reproduced by\nthe PSM up to the highest measured spin, in contrast to the\nsituation in 81Zr. We note in particular that in 79Sr, the same\nPSM calculations achieve a nearly equally good agreement\nin moments of inertia for all the three bands at the low-spin\nregion. This may be qualitatively understood as when we\nleave away from the N=Z line, the requirement for consid-\nering the np pairing is drastically smaller.\nNevertheless, the observed up-bending behavior in the\nf422g5\/2+ band in 79Sr cannot be reproduced. This experi-\nmental band looks rather similar to the f422g5\/2+ band in the\nisotone 81Zr, showing an up-bending in the moment of iner-\ntia around 0.6 MeV for both signatures. On the other hand,\nthe predicted trend by the PSM is that of a broad alignment\n(almost smooth behavior of the moment of inertia), as ex-\npected from the behavior of the moments of inertia in the\nother two bands in 79Sr (f301g3\/2\u2212 and f431g1\/2+) as well as\nfrom those in its even-even neighbors 78,80Sr [24]. The be-\nhavior of this band cannot be described by the PSM, and this\ndisagreement presents a considerable challenge for the\ntheory.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work we have reported a new investigation of the\nN=Z+1 nucleus 81Zr, and new results for its isotone 79Sr.\nFor 81Zr, the previously known f422g5\/2+ and f301g3\/2\u2212\nbands have been extended to higher spins, and the f431g1\/2+\nintruder band has been identified. For 79Sr the known bands\nhave been followed to higher spins. The three bands in the\nN=Z+1 nucleus 81Zr have been compared with the similar\nbands from 79Sr. The f431g1\/2+ band in 81Zr exhibits a pe-\nculiar behavior, without showing any alignment up to a ro-\ntational frequency of 0.68 MeV or even higher, unlike the\none in 79Sr which is similar to the f301g3\/2\u2212 band. Standard\nPSM calculations, which have been successful when applied\nto many yrast bands in this mass region, are not able to\ndescribe the different bands with the same degree of success\nin the two isotones, with the agreement being notably poorer\nin the case of 81Zr. These facts hint to a possible increased\nimportance of the np interactions in the N=Z+1 nucleus, and\nsuggest that it may be a sensitive probe of the np pairing.\nThe adequate treatment of these interactions remains a chal-\nlenge for the PSM. Work along these lines is in progress.\nFrom the experimental point of view, it remains as a very\nimportant and difficult task of the future, to characterize the\nnuclear deformation along the bands by lifetime measure-\nments.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are grateful to S.
