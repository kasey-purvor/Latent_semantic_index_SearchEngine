One lead company in the \nprobiotic little bottle market claims 25 million people across 20 countries as daily \nusers of their products1. In the UK, from the first introduction of 65ml bottles of \nsweetened fermented drink containing probiotic bacteria in 1996, other \ncompanies and products have entered a growing market for probiotic little \nbottles, probiotic yoghurts, probiotic smoothies and so on,  such that an \nestimated 3.5 million UK residents consume some form of probiotic product on a \ndaily basis (Senok, Ismaeel and Botta, 2005).  The success of probiotic little bottles \nis generally regarded as a factor of their reputed health benefits and as consistent \nwith a more general shift in supermarkets supply of products that offer added \nhealth benefits \u2013 collectively known as functional foods in industry circles \n(Heasman and Mellentin, 2001). While the category functional foods currently \nhas no legal status in the UK, it is used within industry to describe foods such as \ncholesterol lowering margarines with added plant stanols, omega-3 fortified \ndrinks and other products where particular health gains are aligned with \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n1  Yakult company brochure, 2006 \n 5 \ningredients deemed to be additional to the food itself (Lehenkari, 2003; Sibbel, \n2007). \n \nThe continued and rapid growth of these products in supermarkets raises, for us, \nquestions about how to account for consumers\u2019 choice of probiotics. The case \nstudy provides an opportunity to reflect on the ways in which \u201araw biological \nvitality\u201b, in this case bacteria as fragments of more complex systems, may be \nmobilised for new health uses and given a marketable exchange value \u2013  what \nCatherine Waldby terms biovalue (Waldby, 2002: 313). The  success of probiotics  \nraises further questions about the new ways in which health-related biovalue is \nmobilised within markets and mobilizes \u2018biologies and selves\u2019 (Brown, 2006; \nWaldby, 2002). First, their consumption for supposed health gains appears at \nodds with the weak scientific evidence supporting the healthy messages such \nproducts convey (Tannock, 1999). Whilst advertisements for probiotics promote \n\u201avitality\u201b, a \u201ahealthy digestive system\u201b,  \u201awellbeing\u201b and \u201abalance\u201b,  the \nevidence that probiotics work to produce such effects, as recent reviews suggest, \nis far from well accepted (Gibson, Rouzaud and Brostoff, 2005; Senok et al., 2005; \nWalker and Buckley, 2006). Second, probiotics are the most successful products \nin the category of functional foods (Sloan, 2004) with estimates that the probiotic \nsector will continue to grow by as much as 40% (Daniells, 2006 ). Not all \nfunctional foods have met with industry expectations of success, leaving some \ndevelopers and investors out of pocket (Heasman et al., 2001). While \ncontroversies over their effectiveness play out in scientific debates,  in the \nsupermarket these concerns appear to have little bearing on their popularity as \n 6 \nconsumer products, and moreover, with indications that they are consumed \nmore as an \u2018article of faith\u2019 and less by the ill than by the healthy - thus raising \nfor some the question of why they are consumed at all (Tannock, 1999). Third, \nthe development of  probiotics occurs in much more complex and contested \nterrain of \u2018facts and myths\u2019 about their possible uses and effectiveness (Senok et \nal., 2005). Interest in probiotics is more widespread than simply the development \nof new food products. Both scepticism and promise about what they are or what \nthey are claimed to do is evident across fields as diverse as animal nutrition, \naquaculture, biotechnology, food technology and medical sciences (Balcazar et \nal., 2006; Holzapfel, 2005; Vanbelle, Teller and Focant, 1989).  \n \nPobiotics describes a new category whose most widely quoted contemporary \ndefinition is \u201alive microorganisms, which, when administered in adequate \namounts, confer a health benefit on the host\u201b (World Health Organisation, 2001: \n5). Like the functional foods category, the link to health is assumed as the \nprimary motivation that underscores their use. However, given controversies \nover facts and myths about their efficacy, does the linkage with health imply \n(and perhaps produce) a more prospective hope about them than the \u2018truth\u2019 \nprovides? Alternatively, what might hope and truth reveal about the context of \nprobiotic developments? In this paper we address the later concern, and rather \nthan addressing, as so many others have done, the question of probiotics efficacy, \nfollowing the work of Moreira and Pallandino (2005) we trace and consider the \nsignificance of hope and truth in relation to them.  \n 7 \nOn hope and truth \nWe begin by placing our research within recent literature documenting an \napparent shift in the epistemological basis of modern bioscience away from \nrationalistic authority towards a much greater emphasis on investment in less \ncertain but hopeful futures (Brown, 2006; Moreira and Palladino, 2005; Novas, \n2006). Various empirical examples may be cited to demonstrate bioscience \ninterest in hopeful technologies and techniques \u2013  predictive medicine, \nnanotechnology,  transgenics. However it is not the proliferation of such \ninnovations that provide evidence for a shift to hope, but observations of the \nconditions for its emergence.  These conditions can be seen to involve a shift in \nwhat counts , and how it counts, as knowledge in biosciences. \n \nDrawing on poststructuralist methodologies and sociologies of science literatures \nregimes of power\/knowledge enable and produce certain ways of viewing the \nworld (Foucault, 1984, 1989; Petersen and Bunton, 1997). Such methodological \napproaches share a concern with the \u201amore or less organized or routinized ways \nof doing things that manifest an immanent logic of reason of their own\u201b (Dean, \n1999). Rejecting an absolutist account of knowledge refocuses attention on \nunderstanding how knowledge (and power) is dependent on particular regimes, \npractices and heterogeneous networks. Different regimes of knowledge provide a \nsubstrate of intelligibility, in this case rendering investment in the future as a \nnormal state of affairs; and thereby affecting the way the future unfolds.  \n \n 8 \nA regime of truth orients towards fabricating \u2018proofs\u2019 and knowledge robustness, \nwhilst the regime of hope is concerned with the fabrication of expectations and \nfuture possibilities (Brown and Michael, 2002; Moreira et al., 2005). Regimes of \ntruth may be said to focus attention on \u2018what is known, rather than what can be\u2019, \nwhile investments in a regimes of hope are in future possibilities of truth, \ndeferring truth and rendering the present open to various efforts in securing the \nuncertainty of the present as an acceptable state of affairs (at least for the \nmoment) (Moreira et al., 2005: 67).  A \u2018parasitic\u2019 relationship may be seen to exist \nbetween hope and truth, in developing innovative medical technologies and \ntechniques, as \u2018hope\u2019 provides a foundation for (and may be also seen to be \nperformative of)  investing efforts in order to secure the \u2018truth\u2019 that something \ngood will come out of the research. The two articulating knowledges\/regimes of \nhope and truth are seen to be in flux in biosciences: but more specifically it is the \narticulation of the relationship between them that is in flux (Moreira et al., 2005). \n \nFor Brown (2006) the \u2018will to the yet not present\u2019 also serves as a basis for \n\u2018promissory abstractions\u2019 that employ values, desires and aesthetics. Brown cites \nan example in which GM food developers modified their consumer message \naway from regimes of truth to regimes of hope \u2013 from using scientific evidence to \npromote their products to using the by-line \u201aimagine\u201b as the marketing message \nto advance the idea that \u201afood, health and hope\u201b underscores their development \nagenda. Marketing hope ties into what has elsewhere been described as a shift \nfrom authority to authenticity (Brown et al., 2002). In regimes of hope not only \nthe messages are different, but also crucially, aspects of subjectivity. Moreira and \n 9 \nPalladino (2005) consider how orienting to a regime of hope also views and \nconstitutes patients as more invested in securing a different and positive future \nfor themselves, whilst appeals to \u2018truth\u2019 leave no space or time for its deferral.  \n \nFinancing biomedical research; enabling the capital investments in hope creates  \nnew spaces for research, new kinds of subjectivities and forms of engagement, \nbut also  raises the spectre of hype and the \u201adamaging implications of failed \nfutures\u201b (Brown, 2003: 5). The promise of biotechnology, of genetic engineering,   \ntransgenics, bioinformatics, probiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and so on \u2013 if \noriented in hope also establish the potential for disillusionment when too much \nis invested in the expectation of their success.  The dynamics of expectation, may \nas Brown suggests, create a need for more workable expectations in relation to \nbiotechnology: \n \nThe problem with the biotechnology sector is that, like many areas of innovation, \nexpectations are sometimes both inflexible and reflect disproportionately \nexaggerated benefits and risks. This occurs for the very reason that future-\nabstractions are put into circulation in the first place \u2013 to have a \u2018performative\u2019 \ninfluence in real time (Brown, 2003: 6). \n \nThe double-bind of expectations is established: the shift to a more hopeful tense \nestablishes the potential for failure, but also enacts a performative function in \nmanifesting hopes in practical and material form that may well produce positive \nfuture outcomes. Moreover, as Novas (2006) considers, in a political economy of \nhope subjects who have until now, been left out of a direct priority setting role in \n 10 \nbiomedical research may be empowered and enabled to direct research towards \nthe aspirational futures of significance to them.  \n \nThus far, our discussion has centred on the tensions between regimes of hope \nand truth in particular relation to biomedicine. The case of probiotics offers a \nsomewhat different vantage point from both the biomedical accounts so far \npresented, as well as debates about innovative technologies in consumer culture. \nIn consumer culture, research that might be said to be concerned with hope and \ntruth (often cast as hype and truth)  have tended to focus on examples where \nthere is a high degree of public scepticism \u2013 a prominent example being \ngenetically-modified (GM) foods (Brown, 2006; Cook, Pieri and Robbins, 2004; \nCook, Robbins and Pieri, 2006). The GM debate has been typified by the hopeful \nfutures suggested by industry (backed by scientific evidence) and the way in \nwhich they are sometimes consumed as unsatisfactory truths for a sceptical \npublic. First, it is not the presence of scepticism in the public sphere but the lack \nthat intrigues in relation to probiotics. Second probiotics biovalue seems more \nhighly regarded in consumer settings than in biomedicine. If the articulation of \nrelationships between hope and truth may be said to vary between biomedicine \nand consumer markets, it may also be that parasitism can be investigated as \nspatially constituted. In short, probiotics provide an empirical case study through \nwhich to examine how different spatialities deploy different configurations of hope and \ntruth. \n \n 11 \nIn what follows we examine three spatial aggregations of actors and their \nrepresentations of hopes and truth about probiotics. The first takes as its point of \ndeparture an extensive review of the status of probiotics in biomedicine. The \nsecond occurs in an intermediary space of the media through an examination of \nan interaction between different publics and scientists in which public actors \nrespond to a scientific review of probiotics. Finally we take the examination into \nconsumer culture and consider how two lead producers of probiotic \u2018little \nbottles\u2019 market their products to the public.  \nProbiotic expansions \u2013 the future of medicine? \n \nAre probiotics the future of medicine? Theoretically, beneficial micro-organisms \ncould be used to treat a range of clinical conditions that have been linked to \npathogens, including gastrointestinal problems like irritable bowel syndrome and \ninflammatory bowel disease\u2026oral diseases like tooth decay and peridontal \ndisease, and various other infections. Probiotics could also conceivably be put to \nuse in preventing disease or thwarting autoimmune disorders (Walker et al., 2006: \n3).  \n \nThe quote above introduces a report by the American Academy of Microbiology \nand is based on a colloquium held in 2005 on the topic of probiotics. The \ncolloquium included 38 participants from fields as diverse as microbiology, \nmedicine, animal science, immunology and nutrition amongst others; and from \nthe UK, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany as well as the US.  \nThe report is titled Probiotic microbes: the scientific basis, a title which establishes \n 12 \nthe tone of what we expect will follow, a description of the \u2018truth\u2019 about what is \nknown. Indeed the report is premised on the recognition that, an \u201aevaluation of \nthe current state of knowledge about probiotics is required\u201b(3). The report \nsuggests:  \n \nThe buzz about probiotics has become a roar. But what can beneficial \nmicroorganisms really accomplish? Can these products benefit human \nor animal health? When it comes to probiotics, what is real and what \nis fiction? (Walker et al., 2006: 5). \n \nDespite the appeal to truth signified by the title and elements of the quotes \nabove, is also oriented towards the potential future benefits that probiotics might \nprovide for a range of clinical conditions and preventive options. The \nintroductory sections of the report are filled with prospective terminologies that \nalign with a regime of hope: \u201atheoretically\u201b, \u201aconceivably\u201b, \u201apossibilities\u201b, \n\u201aexploration\u201b, \u201acould reduce the risk\u201b, \u201apotential effect\u201b, \u201acould have beneficial \noutcomes\u201b and so on. The effect is not to discount hope, but rather to establish \nwhat is regarded as (yet) untrue or as fiction.   \n \nIn what follows is a listing of different conditions, the research on probiotics and \nthe limited, but nevertheless promising evidence-base that probiotics might have \nuses for a series of target disorders: diarrhoea, pouchitis, irritable bowel \nsyndrome, bladder cancer, urogential infections, clostridium difficile infection, \natopic eczema. Based on this evidence the report then lists the potential future \napplications for therapeutic treatments, the limits of the evidence and inherent \n 13 \ndifficulties in measuring and universalizing the results.  The complexity of the \ngut and of microorganisms and their variable effects within it renders any \nappeals to \u2018truth\u2019 metered by the lack of a similarly complex evidence-base.  \n \nIn short, the report of the American Microbiological Association attempts to \ndraw a shared truth about probiotics from a diversity of scientific actors engaged \nin a controversy.  Moreira and Pallandino (2005) demonstrate how aggregations \nof actors occur around regimes of hope and truth. The power of the aggregation \nappears greater than the sum of its parts, thus it is through the coming-together \nof different actors that stabilizes further the appeal to a regime of truth.  \n \nHowever, although the report is directed to settle the controversy over \neffectiveness through appeals to truth, it also appeals to a hope of something \ngood coming out of the research that is necessary to move beyond this. Fiction \nbecomes a metaphor for hype, but also discounts the performative function of \nfuturity in stabilizing the future research agenda.  Securing resources, \ndemonstrating the need for research is necessarily premised on hope, but there is \nno authoritative space for such fantasizing in a regime of truth.  The parasitic \nrelationship that is established justifies the need for research (on the hopeful \npredictions about what might be possible)  precisely because the \u2018truth\u2019 is not \nknown. By the end of the report it is the lack of truth that provides the key \nrationale for financing future research, the final recommendations list areas of \nuncertainty, suitability of testing procedures and the need for robust evidence: \n \n 14 \n  \nThere is a pronounced need for large, carefully designed (randomized, placebo \ncontrolled) clinical trials of probiotics that undertake broad sampling of host \nmicrobiota, have clear end points, and have well informed participants who \nconsent to treatment. Investigations like these are needed to overcome the placebo \neffect and other barriers to the thorough investigation of probiotic products \n(Walker et al., 2006: 19). \n  \nThe parasitic relationship between hope and truth is in effect, a masterful bait \nand switch. The bait is an appeal to truth, but the switch is that hope about their \npotential is the underlying trope that the report eventually succumbs to. It is \napparent however that the authors themselves do not align with a regime of \nhope even as they employ it, but rather see themselves as the truth seekers.   \n \nWe now turn to a different aggregation of actors in which science is challenged \nby those \u2018outside\u2019 the biomedical realm. \nHope in the supermarket \u2013 truth in the lab? \nA commentary piece on probiotics that appeared in the British Medical \nJournal(BMJ) demonstrates how different actors deploy hope and truth in ways \nthat do not augur well for agreement. Here we compare a science commentary \non probiotics with a series of rapid responses published in the BMJ over the \nfollowing year and a half. \n \n 15 \nScience editor of the BMJ, Abi Berger, wrote a short commentary on probiotics \nthat provoked a flurry of critical responses from readers (Butler, 2002; Hayden, \n2003; Leger, 2002; McClain, 2002). Berger described probiotics as microbes that \ncould in some cases prevent disease in the host and commented on their \npromising results in preventing diarrhoea and atopy (allergic reactions where \nthere is no direct contact between the allergen and effect; such as eczema) in \nchildren. He suggested that while it was known that antibiotics modify the \ncomposition of the flora of the gut, and diarrhoea was one consequence of that, it \nwas still not clear that probiotic supplements could act to substitute for such \nlosses. Although promising, Berger suggested that there was still much to be \nlearned about probiotics because of the complexity of the gut and related \nuncertainties about how they worked, and the lack of studies providing sufficient \nevidence of efficacy. Berger\u2019s truth about probiotics was far from unhopeful, but \nrather emphasised \u2018that which is known\u2019 over the more prospective, but \nnevertheless hopeful truth that there was more to be learned. Nevertheless, four \nresponses critical of the commentary were aired that signalled dissatisfaction \nwith the \u2018truth\u2019 as presented. \n \nA journalist responded with a critique arguing that: \n \n \u2026for years, I have watched the medical profession floundering around on the \nissue of probiotics. There seems to be a philosophy that anything is only \u2018useful\u2019, if \nit is clinically proven to be useful. Even more so, if \u2018we\u2019 say so (Butler, 2002). \n \n 16 \n The position is one of fault finding, not with probiotics per se, but with the \nauthority of science and the modes through which scientists engage with the \nworld. The author defers truth about probiotics by emphasising uncertainty and \nusing it as a justification for far greater investment in hope.  \n \nA natural health consultant expresses \u201adelight\u201b at the new scientific interest in \nprobiotics , \u201aeven if it seems moot to the cultured kefir-eaters among us\u201b (Leger, \n2002). Kefir is a fermented milk product that is linked with a long history of use \nin the Caucasus and is highly regarded amongst Complementary and Alternative \nMedical communities (CAM). Tradition, experience and history provides a truth \nabout an example of a product containing various bacteria that slot nicely into \nthe probiotic category, but the example of kefir is used to demonstrate the truth \nabout the category as a whole. Truth is not linked directly to probiotics, but to a \nmore complex set of associations in which demonstration of efficacy is not \nclinically proven, but is made evident through the association of a diverse set of \npeople united as, ergo healthy,  kefir-eaters. \n \nA specialist lactation consultant questions the profiteering of companies \npatenting bacterium found in fecal samples of babies for eventual use in formula \nfeeds, and suggest that the properties have been \u201aappropriated\u201b by researchers \nwho are paid by commercial interests to be used in products that may even \n\u201asabotage\u201b breastfeeding. She asks: \n \n 17 \nIs the interest in probiotics the end result of scientific enquiry or the result of the \npatenting of these organisms by corporations seeking to turn a profit? (McClain, \n2002).  \n \nThe author deploys a regime of truth to question the role of capital in investing \ntoo heavily in hope, but moreover seeks \u2018truth\u2019  through alignments of nature, \nand particularly mother nature with health. That tendency to represent women \nand children, particularly babies as aligned to, or as a metaphor for, nature and \nhealth is far from a new observation (Stratford, 1998). \n \nFinally, a mother responds to the discussion with a personal story detailing her \nsuccess with a probiotic treatment of her 5 month old baby\u2019s eczema. She admits, \n\u201aI ignored my GP and health visitor when they suggested various creams and \nsteroids\u201b (Hayden, 2003). She seeks information from internet searches. Finding \n\u2018truth\u2019 in internet information and grateful for the scientific articles already out \nthere defending the value of probiotics, in this instance she does not defer truth \nso much as pre-empt it.   \n \nThe commentary and responses demonstrate different spatial configurations of \ntruth and hope that play out in the development (or reconstitution) of \nbiotechnologies. The \u2018truth\u2019 about probiotics in the biomedical sphere is also \nnested within regimes of hope about what they may achieve in treatment based \noutcomes. In the views of those responding negatively to the commentary, the \ntruth may be constituted differently, or even through the same means, but with \ndifferent effects. The tendency is for fault finding (deferring truth), but not \n 18 \nnecessarily in relation to probiotics themselves \u2013 but other concerns \u2013 about \nscientific methods, other systems of belief like CAM, and personal experience. \nThus it is not just how hope and truth may be associated with different actors in \nthe controversy over effectiveness, but also what hope and truth relate to.  \n \nThe observation that innovation is situated ties to work in studies of science and \ntechnology, not about hope and truth, but concerning the ways in which interest \nin new biotechnological development often fails to take account of the context \ninto which they are placed. It is all too easy in studies of biotechnology, suggests \nBingham (2005) to focus on the novel innovation itself rather than exploring the \nsurroundings in which such technologies necessarily emerge within and around. \nIn this view, and drawing on the work of Mol (1993), Bingham argues that \nbiotechnologies do not materialize in a void, but into a world already complex \nand full. \u2018Things\u2019 in the neighbourhood of biotechnologies, he suggests, can be \ninvestigated to give insights into where technologies, for example probiotic little \nbottles, fit. This seems appropriate for two reasons. First, as has been \ndemonstrated thus far, the promise of probiotics is not simply different between \nactors but appears to have a spatial quality; it appears differently in biomedical \nand popular consumption sites. Second, what hope and truth refer to in the \ncontroversy about probiotics, is not necessarily probiotics themselves. Extending \nour theoretical approach in the following section, in which we look specifically at \nthe case of little bottles, we consider actors, aggregations and hope and truth \naround probiotics in the supermarket, but also ask where (in the world) hope and \ntruth emerge.  \n 19 \nBetween hope and truth and next to  \nIn this section we present key findings of a content analysis of advertisements \nfrom the two leading probiotic manufactures in the UK (Yakult and Danone \nActimel) over a two year period (January 2005-January 2007); this includes \nadvertisements from a range of different media including television, newspaper \nand the internet. Our interest was in exposing different articulations of hope and \ntruth between science and popular consumption.  We therefore focused our \ninvestigation on how the leading probiotic companies might frame messages for \npopular consumption, and the coherence of such framings across a random \nsample of their advertisements (Krippendorff, 2004). A selection of from each \ncompany and genre (newspaper, internet video, internet text, television \nadvertisements) were sampled at six monthly intervals.   While we utilised a \ncontent analysis method to ensure a consistent approach to the selections, our \naim was not to prove assertions to be true or generalisable. Following Peirce \n(1958) and Eco\u2019s (1976) account of abductive analysis where examination occurs \nnot through simple deduction or induction but rather through a process of \ninference, insight, empirical observation (in this case of adverts) and logical \nreasoning to generate new understandings we present an argument for a \nparticular explanation (cf. Iedema, 2007). We detail two fairly typical examples of \nthese advertisements and refer to a few others to consider where hope emerges, \nnext to what and associated with what promissory abstractions.  \n \nClose up of a woman holding three videos she looks at the camera and says: \n\u201aWell in order to maintain my er wellbeing I\u2019ve become completely dependent \n 20 \non these er yoga videos\u201b.  As the camera pans out we see her placing the video\u2019s \non a pile of others and moving backwards into a relaxed seated position in a \nlounge chair drinking a bottle of Actimel; the camera gives a close up of the little \nbottle as the narrator in the background states \u201aOnly Actimel has the l.casei \nimmuitas culture\u201d. The camera returns to the woman lazing in the chair, she leans \nforward to place the little bottle on the pile of yoga videos and as she does so \nsays \u201a stretch \u201c, the narrator states:  the Actimel habit, keep it up\u201d  the woman leans \nback in the chair and says \u201arelax\u201b, the advertisement ends with the narration mm \nDanone2 \nBox 1: Description of Yoga advertisement for Actimel (Danone, 2002) \n \nThe advertisements about probiotics vary considerably in content, form and \ndelivery, however common representations are, like the Actimel advertisement \nabove, of individual consumers who need do very little to secure a desirable \nhealth state (Box 1). The appeal to regimes of truth lies in the authenticity of the \nparticular bacterial culture that is used by the company Danone and, other than \nthe appeal to make this a habitual activity, the company says nothing directly \nabout the evidence of effectiveness or even what health states the person may \nseek to address by using the product. Rather, the woman herself embodies the \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n2 Viewed on a one off basis at http:\/\/www.uk.actimel.com\/ \n 21 \nhealth state that is desired \u2013 one in which knowledge of yoga demonstrates her \nappreciation of the need for physical exercise, but where the placement of the \nnow empty little bottle on top of the pile of videos signifies its effective \nreplacement through consumption.  \n \nThe marketers aestheticize probiotics (Brown, 2006) deploying a vision of health \nand well-being. But such an aesthetic may also be seen to be nested within \nparticular discourses of health. The sociological literature on \u2018healthism\u2019 \n(Crawford, 1980) is now more than two decades old, and yet observations about \nthe shift from treatment oriented regimes of health to lifestyle interventions and \nideas about healthy living still resonate in contemporary settings.  Bunton, Nettle \nand Burrows (1995) contribution to the sociology of health promotion sets out \nthis transition. But it is worth returning to one of their key observations: with the \nshift in biomedical interest, there is a cultural shift to healthism. Healthism is \nseen to have a value beyond medicine that articulates with consumer culture in \nparticular ways, most notably in the present through ideas of \u201ayouth, vitality, \nenergy and so on\u201b (Henderson and Petersen, 2002).  \n \nCertainly youth, vitality and energy are routinely employed in many \nadvertisements for probiotics. Indeed one probiotic \u2018little bottle\u2019 company \nmarkets their goods directly as  \u2018Vitality\u2019 (M\u00fcller Company).  Yet the aesthetic of \none-slurp-well-being is not the only kind of engagement with the public \u2013 \nregimes of truth underscore much of the advertising for the Yakult company, \nalbeit less for public consumption than for those publics that make the extra \n 22 \neffort to learn more about the product by visiting the  more detailed literatures \navailable through the company websites. \n \nThe index page for the Yakult company website in the UK provides the following \ntext: \n \nDo you do something you believe in? Us too. Our little bottle. Full of good bacteria. \nTo help your digestive system. Which can lead to better natural defences. Simple. \nOur founder Dr. Shirota certainly thought so; he dedicated his life to isolating a \nstrain of bacteria beneficial to human health. He succeeded in 1935 and placed his \nunique bacteria into a milk drink so its benefits were accessible to all. Have a \nwander around our website to find out what Yakult can do for you \n(www.yakult.co.uk, accessed 14 January 2007) \n \nThe content of the introductory statement about Yakult contains a series of \ndeclarative statements: our little bottle, full of good bacteria etc. Each of which \ncan be examined individually in order to raise questions about what else in the \nworld such concerns relate to. The following is a prospective analysis, and not \none that necessarily can be verified without further examination \u2013 rather the \ndiscussion demonstrates probiotics little bottles emerge in a world that may be \nseen to be already complex and full (Bingham, 2006). \n \nThe little bottle: both Yakult and Danone, as the biggest players in the probiotic \ndrinks market in the UK, have used the unique packaging as a key element of \ntheir  marketing strategies and the use of \u2018daily-dose\u2019 formulas has been cited as \n 23 \nkey element of the success of probiotics; as well as other goods packaged in little \nbottles (Mattila-Sandholm et al., 2002). The appeal of a little bottle may lie in \nconvenience of a single serve, but it also accords with a language more common \nin the medical sphere in advocating particular dosage levels, taken regularly, as a \nmeans to achieve a health outcome. The little bottle may in fact, appeal to both a \nregime of truth in its medical guise, and exist within a regime of hope in aligning \nwith a contemporary concern for convenience. Put another way, the little bottle is \nnot the same thing if entangled in regimes of hope or of truth. The qualities of the \nlittle bottle are different in an ontological sense, changing in different regimes \nand settings. \nGood bacteria: \u2018good\u2019 and its obvious opposite \u2018bad\u2019 create an all-too simplistic \nimage of right and wrong that belies any question of complexity that is so much a \nfeature of the biomedical investigation of probiotics and their variable effects. \nThough all too black and white, the appeal in marketing may not be about \nprobiotics per se, but rather lie for example,  in a new awareness that not all \nbacteria have negative health effects. Such a shift in thinking may in turn have \nbeen precipitated by concerns about anti-microbial resistance and the over-use of \nantibiotics and public health campaigns to raise awareness of the issue \n(Department of Health, 2000). Though we do not wish to make the claim that \nprobiotics are successful because of public awareness of anti-microbial resistance, \nawareness of both has certainly risen in the same time frame \u2013 perhaps \nwarranting further investigation of a link. \nHelp digestive system, better natural defences: There is strong association between \nprobiotics and securing the body against that which is outside using individuals\u2019 \n 24 \nseemingly innate immunity. The contemporary concern with personal security \nhas resonances with the threats not only to individuals, but to nations as a whole. \nThe global threat of terrorism, biological warfare and so on, provide as Brian \nMassumi suggests, a \u2018background hum of anxiety\u2019 that pervades every aspect of \nhuman activity (Massumi, 1993). The notion of \u2018balance\u2019 is another element \ncommonly invoked in the advertisements for probiotic little bottles: \u2018restoring \nbalance\u2019, \u2018maintaining balance\u2019 and in general, reordering relations between \nhumans and their internal flora. Balance, like immunity, functions as a \nmetaphorical device associated with inside and outside, self and society. \nHowever consider the following statement from one probiotic company:  \u201aAs we \nall try to juggle increasingly hectic lifestyles, it\u2019s often difficult to maintain a \nhealthy diet\u201b: here balance refers to lifestyle factors and their influence on diet. In \nthis view, consuming probiotics may be part of the solution to imbalances in \nlifestyle \u2013 and ones that can be remedied not by changing lifestyle practices, but \nby adding new elements to the diet. \nSimple: A magic bullet? The marketers do not explain why Yakult or probiotics \nshould be regarded as simple and unambiguously good for health, but they do \noffer a method by which to accept this simple \u2018truth\u2019. The paragraph tells the \nstory of Dr Shirota, a man who we should believe in because as \u2018they\u2019 suggest, \nthey do. The product is marketed through appeals to authenticity derived from \nthe portrayal of an eminent scientist and founding figure \u2013 a man that embodies \na regime of truth. \n \n 25 \nIn short probiotics establish a new foundation upon which to measure health and \nthrough which to establish hope and truth about them; in particular through the \nnotion of the body in imbalance. The \u2018truth\u2019 that is established is of a new kind of  \nacceptance that however much harmony bodies are capable of, the essential \ndisharmony of modern living renders us unable to live without added health. \nOne question arising from the consumption of probiotics is then what kind of \nsubjectivities does this give rise to? Isin (2004) has argued that such disharmonies \nare symptomatic of the emergence of a new kind of \u2018neurotic\u2019 subject:  \u201awhile on \nthe one hand neurotic subjects are incited to manage their anxieties by adjusting \ntheir conduct, they are also incited to administer themselves with pharmaceutical \ninterventions without making adjustments to conduct\u201b(226). The neurotic subject \nof probiotic consumption feeds within regimes of hope that are in turn, fed by \nappeals to regimes of truth. \nDiscussion and conclusion: on hope truth and geography \nWe have not implicitly discussed how geography might be used to think about \nregimes of hope and truth, however by dividing our discussion into three \nsections that detail different aggregations of actors we have located them \ndifferently and found similarities in each aggregation in the ways that hope and \ntruth play out. Brown(2006: 4) observes that \u201auncertainties become less visible \nthe further one travels in space and time from the material messiness of the \nbench\u201b and that for this reason,  regimes of hope and truth might be thought of \nas spatially and temporary patterned. The public acceptance of probiotics does \nseem to provide an example where distance from the bench erodes the messy \n 26 \nuncertainties about the \u2018truth\u2019 of them: and almost entirely.  However in our \nview it is more than distance from uncertainty that may be considered in this \nspatial patterning; we observe that the form of parasitic relation between regimes \nof hope and truth are also spatially patterned.  \n \nThe observation of Tannock, raised in the introduction, that probiotics may be \nconsumed as an \u2018article of faith\u2019 in the supermarket, provides a clue that the \nsubject constituted by and within spatial regimes of hope and truth as the lynch-\npin of the kinds of parasitism that emerge. The promissory abstractions of \nsimplicity, immunity, self-defence, well-being and so on, are premised on the \nsubject being situated outside biomedicine. In contrast, while the articulation of \nthe relationship between regimes of hope and truth may be shifting within \nbiosciences, the subject sill maintains the \u2018self\u2019 through a regime of truth \u2013 as \nsuggested, there is no place for promissory abstractions in the laboratory. Put \nanother way, there is no place for a new kind of subject constituted within \nregimes of hope within the laboratory.  \n \nIn our examination we have considered how the notion of regimes of hope and \ntruth might be useful for thinking about how different aggregations of actors \nengage in a controversy about the biovalue of probiotics. We conclude that \nfocusing only on the object of our investigation, probiotics, is not sufficient to \nexplain where the promise of probiotics resides.  Using the example of company \nadvertising about them we sought to uncover some plausible, though untested, \nreasons that regimes of hope and truth apply to much broader concerns than \n 27 \nsimply the development of the innovative product itself.  For us, the \ndevelopment of priobiotics is symptomatic of the new spatial formations \ncommon to contemporary public health: the supermarket and home as more than \nplaces where food gets bought and prepared, but where ideas about health and \nillness are increasingly reside. We concur with others that there is a spatial \npatterning to regimes of hope and truth, but suggest new approaches are \nrequired to consider the significance of shifting balance between the articulation \nof truth and hope and its spatial patterning.  \n \nIn practical terms, our examination of probiotics provides some further insight \ninto their marketing success, also suggesting there is more to their appeal that \nparticular health gains. Probioitics articulate a range of contemporary discourses \nabout health that include those from within biomedicine, but also in terms of a \npublic health focus on lifestyle and the cultural appeal of healthism; amongst \nother less easily identified values and aesthetics. Their appeal is multifarious and \ncomplex. The category of functional foods appears to conflate health with \nevidence based medicine and offers a range of new products for consumers in \nthese terms, however the success of probiotics in relation to other functional \nfoods provides some indication that probiotics articulate more than \u2018simply\u2019 \nbiomedical concerns.  \n \nFinally, we raised some concerns about the new subjectivities that emerge from \nthese discussions. In our analysis the biomedical subject remains one driven by \nrational enlightenment thinking, despite the new salience of hope in driving \n 28 \ninnovations forward within the laboratory. However the consumer does appear \ndifferently - forged through an expectation of disharmony.  \n \n 29 \nReferences \nBalcazar, J.
