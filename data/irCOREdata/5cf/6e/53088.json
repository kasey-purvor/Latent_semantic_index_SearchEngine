Map of the Antarctic Treaty area (south of latitude 60\u25e6S) showing the\nlocations of year-round and seasonal stations built on rock or permanent ice (i.e.\nice sheets or ice shelves). Data on station locations were taken from the Council\nof Managers of National Antarctic Programs website (COMNAP 2010). There is\nevidence to suggest that although these stations are registered on the COMNAP\nlist, a number of stations are not regularly occupied or in use (see United\nKingdom et al 2006, p9).\n1748-9326\/10\/041001+03$30.00 1 \u00a9 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd Printed in the UK\nEnviron. Res. Lett. 5 (2010) 041001 Perspective\nSince the influx of national scientific research programmes and infrastructure\nthat accompanied the International Geophysical Year (1957\u20131958), Antarctica\u2019s\nhabitats have been encroached upon increasingly by human activities. Over 120\nresearch stations have been built (\u223c75 currently operational) with the great\nmajority located on ice-free coastal ground to allow ease of access by ship.\n(Headland 2009, COMNAP 2010). Construction of cargo and personnel landing\nand handling facilities, station buildings, airport infrastructure, roads and fuel\nstorage areas have, to varying degrees, destroyed native vegetation and terrestrial\nfauna and displaced bird and marine mammals from breeding sites in their\nimmediate environment. An early history of poor environmental management and\nwaste disposal practices around many stations has left a legacy of\nfuel-contaminated ground and abandoned waste sites in adjacent marine and\nterrestrial environments (Tin et al 2009).\nConstruction of research stations and other infrastructure fulfils two national\nobjectives: (1) supporting geopolitical aspirations of claimant nations and (2)\ndemonstrating a significant commitment to undertaking science in Antarctica,\nwhich is a prerequisite for attaining consultative status at the Antarctic Treaty\nConsultative Meeting. However, these objectives may not be supported equally,\nwith little or no science performed routinely at some stations (United Kingdom et\nal 2006). In addition, co-ordination of science activities between\nnations\u2014another aspiration under the Antarctic Treaty\u2014is often lacking, leading\nto duplication of research between national programmes, and even that\nundertaken at nearby stations. In some cases, components of national research\nprogrammes lack any international, open or objective assessment of quality.\nNevertheless, new nations continue to become involved in Antarctic affairs, and\nalmost inevitably seek to establish their own infrastructure, while some\nestablished Treaty Parties continue to further expand their existing logistic and\ninfrastructure footprints. Despite calls for nations to share existing infrastructure\nor reuse abandoned stations (ATCM 2006), new stations continue to be\nconstructed on pristine sites, with the Antarctic terrestrial environment in\nparticular coming under increased pressure.\nThe Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (commonly\nknown as the Environmental Protocol), which came into force in 1998, sets out\ncommon minimum standards for environmental management by all Antarctic\nTreaty Parties. Under the Protocol, it is mandatory to regularly monitor the\nenvironmental impacts caused by any new infrastructure that requires the\ncompletion of a Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation during the planning, as\nwould be required for research stations or other large building projects. Ideally,\nmonitoring should include assessment of levels of physical disruption of marine\nand terrestrial habitats, and should record levels of pollutants and also their\nimpacts upon the full range of biological groups within local ecosystems.\nBiodiversity surveys should also be undertaken, in order that introduced\nnon-native species can be identified at an early stage and eradicated (Hughes and\nConvey 2010).\nBut where can the scientific data describing national Antarctic programme\nimpacts be found? Some nations have a good track record of publishing\nenvironmental monitoring data, but the large majority do not. With around 75\nactive stations, monitoring research should be well represented in the scientific\nliterature, but data for most stations are not available. Furthermore, Antarctic\nTreaty signatory nations are required to supply details of their monitoring work\nthrough the Antarctic Treaty System\u2019s Electronic Information Exchange System\n(see www.ats.aq\/e\/ie.htm), yet only three out of 28 Treaty nations did so for\n2008\/2009.\nIn their recent synthesis paper, Kennicutt et al (2010) describe the results of a\nlong-term monitoring programme at the United States\u2019 McMurdo Station, giving\nus a comprehensive picture of human impacts at this location. The high quality\nand breadth of this research makes it one of the best-documented\n2\nEnviron. Res. Lett. 5 (2010) 041001 Perspective\nand longest-running monitoring programmes within Antarctica to date. Yet, why\nis this work so exceptional, when the USA have simply fulfilled their obligations\nunder the Environmental Protocol? Monitoring programmes of this standard\nshould be undertaken for all stations and large infrastructure. Factors preventing\nthis may include (1) a lack of monitoring expertise or access to sophisticated\ntechniques, particularly by smaller or less well-funded Antarctic programmes,\nand (2) the lack of importance or prestige attributed to \u2018routine\u2019 monitoring or\nsurvey programmes by science funding bodies, compared to other \u2018forefront\u2019\nscience areas.\nWith little formal international scrutiny other than occasional station\ninspections, a lack of enforcement mechanisms in place to penalize contravention\nof the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty and its related legal instruments, and a\nneed to maintain good diplomatic relations between Antarctic Treaty Parties,\nnations are under little pressure to prioritize human impact monitoring. Despite\nthe efforts of the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research and COMNAP,\nmost Antarctic nations still act individually, with little co-ordination of\nmonitoring effort or use of standardized techniques. Close examination of the\nEnvironmental Protocol even casts some doubt over whether monitoring of\ninfrastructure constructed before its implementation in 1998 is a formal\nobligation, although many would maintain that failure to do so would be contrary\nto the spirit of the Protocol.\nWhile it can be hoped that most signatory nations take their Antarctic\nenvironmental responsibilities seriously, recent reports of poor environmental\npractice show that not all national programmes adhere fully to even the minimum\nrequirements of the Environmental Protocol (Braun et al 2010). If basic\nenvironmental practice is poor, then standards of environmental monitoring may\nalso be poor or non-existent. In stark contrast, researchers from Antarctic\nprogrammes who willingly disseminate their results through the scientific\nliterature deserve credit as they allow other nations to learn from their efforts.\nUntil all Antarctic Treaty nations engage with their monitoring obligations and\ndevelop together a co-ordinated continent-wide view of human impacts,\nAntarctica\u2019s environmental values will remain under threat of continued\ndegradation and the principles of the Antarctic Treaty brought into disrepute.\nReferences\nATCM 2006 Final Report of the 29th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting paragraph 73, available\nonline at www.ats.aq\/documents\/ATCM29\/fr\/ATCM29 fr001 e.pdf\nBraun C et al 2010 Environmental situation and management proposals for the Fildes region\n(Antarctic) Int.
