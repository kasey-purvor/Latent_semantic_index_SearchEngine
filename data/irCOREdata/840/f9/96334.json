If there\nare strong complementarities or substitutes between workers and jobs, the exact allocation has large\nefficiency implications. In contrast, when complementarities are nearly absent, not much output is lost\nfrom randomly allocating workers to jobs. This is important for policy, for example whether we want to\ndesign an unemployment insurance program that provides incentives for workers to look for the \u201cright\u201d\njob instead of accepting the first offer (see for example Acemoglu and Shimer 1999). Complementarities\nand sorting also have profound implications for wage inequality across differently skilled workers (see\nfor example Sattinger 1975). Sorting based on complementarities is also the driving force in a variety\nof applications: it is central to the argument of skill-biased technological change; it affects the impact\nof immigration on the domestic labor force; and it shapes the effect of subsidies to education.\nWe address two questions in this work. First, we ask whether we can determine if more productive\nworkers are employed in more productive jobs. Second, we ask whether we can determine the magnitude\nof the loss from mismatch when workers are not employed in the optimal firm. Both questions have\nattracted recent interest because of the availability of worker-firm match data (see Postel-Vinay and\nRobin (2006) for an overview) that gives a panel dimension of observations for each worker and firm.\nWhen thinking about the answer to each of the questions, we focus on wage data only. While data on\nprofits and output is also available, this is typically reported at the firm level and, therefore, it is not\nvery informative about the productivity of each individual job in the firm.1\nThe first question \u2013 whether more productive workers work in more productive jobs \u2013 is a positive\nexercise. It provides insights into the features of the production technology. If the answer is affirmative\nand there is positive sorting, it means that the inputs in production, worker skill and job productivity,\nexhibits strong enough complementarities. The marginal product of a worker increases the better the\nfirm is, i.e., the technology is supermodular. Alternatively, if sorting is negative, this provides evidence\nthat inputs in production are substitutes and that the technology is submodular. The canonical example\nof negative sorting is the work of a consultant, where the better consultants may be needed in the firms\nthat are currently least productive. Unfortunately, from our analysis we conclude that we cannot identify\nthe sign of sorting. Based on wage data alone, it is impossible to determine whether sorting is positive\nor negative. The reason is that wages reflect a worker\u2019s marginal product. Under complementarity, this\nis high in productive jobs while it is low under substitutability. Wages alone thus do not allow us to\ndetermine the ranking among firms, and it is not possible to find out whether more able workers derive\ntheir higher marginal product from more productive firms or not.\nSecond, we ask how large the gains are from matching workers to the appropriate firms, and cor-\nrespondingly, how big the losses are from mismatch. This question about the strength of sorting is\nnormative. It allows us to evaluate the efficiency gains from improved job search and other labor mar-\nket interventions. Our findings provide an affirmative answer: we can identify the strength of sorting.\nWe propose a simple algorithm that allows us to back out (the absolute value of) the degree of com-\nplementarity, even without information on the sign of sorting. The main source of identification is the\nsearch behavior by workers that differs when the degree of complementarity is high, and when as a\n1We further discuss the benefits and limitations of additional data beyond wages below.\n1\nresult, sorting is important.\nIn addition to answering these two identification questions, we also show that neither of these\nquestions can be answered with the widely cited method that analyzes the correlation between firm and\nworker fixed effects from wage regressions. This method is first proposed in a seminal paper by Abowd,\nKramarz and Margolis (1999), AKM henceforth. The obtained correlation aims to answer the sign and\nstrength questions in one: whether it is positive or negative and how big the coefficient is. The idea\nis that more productive firms pay higher wages than lower wage firms irrespective of the exact worker\nthey hire, and the firm fixed effect therefore recovers the ranking of the firms. We show analytically\nthat obtaining the firm ranking is not feasible due to the way wages are determined in equilibrium, and\nas a result, the correlation coefficient is not capable of informing us about the sign nor the strength.\nOur analysis builds on the most standard sorting model. We start from the assignment problem\nanalyzed by Koopmans and Beckmann (1957), Shapley and Shubik (1971), and popularized by Becker\n(1973). In the Beckerian theory, high type workers match with high productivity jobs when there are\ncomplementarities. Wages are set competitively and reflect the marginal contribution of a worker\u2019s\nskill. Most importantly, even off the equilibrium allocation, the possible wages paid to mismatched\npartners are constrained by equilibrium: off-equilibrium wages must be such that they do not induce\nagents from knowingly deviating from the equilibrium allocation. One innovation of our approach is to\nexplore not only the properties of the wages along the Beckerian allocation, but also of the wages for\nmismatched agents that happen to \u201ctremble\u201d off the equilibrium path. The properties of those wages\nby mismatched pairs are crucial for our identification strategy. Once we introduce mismatch as an\nequilibrium outcome due to search frictions, we can actually link the properties of those wages from\nmismatch to actually observed wages.\nWe find that wages of a given worker have an inverted U-shape around the optimal allocation, which\ncorresponds to the frictionless wage. This non-monotonicity reflects the opportunity cost of a firm to\nmatch with an inappropriate worker type. For a given worker, wages are low if he matches with a \u201cbad\u201d\nfirm, because the value that is generated is low. Maybe less obviously, his wage is also low if he matches\nwith a very \u201cgood\u201d firm. The reason is that higher productivity firms have to be compensated for their\nwillingness to match with a \u201cbad\u201d worker because it destroys their opportunity to match with a \u201cgood\u201d\nworker. Under complementarities that firm has a disproportionately larger marginal product with the\ngood worker. This leads to the highest compensation if a worker meets the \u201cright\u201d firm, rather than\na wage schedule that is increasing everywhere in the type of firm. To see that the inverted U-shape is\nactually part of any sorting equilibrium with search frictions, observe that the set of eligible partners\nis bounded by those matches where the match surplus is zero relative to the value of continued search.\nThese bounds in general arise both for low type firms that are too inefficient and for high type firms\nthat rather wait for a better worker, while for intermediate firm types the surplus is strictly positive.\nAny bargaining procedure that pays wages that are monotonic in the surplus after accounting for the\noutside option of attracting a more appropriate type will therefore result in wages being non-monotonic\nin firm type.\nBecause of the non-monotonic effect of firm type on wages, the wage cannot be decomposed in an\nadditively separable firm and worker fixed effect. We show analytically that the misspecification is not\ninnocuous: for the most common specifications in the literature the firm fixed effect misses any direct\n2\nconnection to the true type of the firm.\nIn spite of the fact that we cannot identify the sign with any procedure, we develop a method that\nenables us to identify the strength of sorting. We thus offer an alternative to remedy the shortcomings\nof the fixed effects regression. Identification derives from the distinct features of the search behavior of\nworkers under different degrees of complementarities. First, we extract from the range of wages paid\nwhat the cost of search is. The highest observed wage corresponds to the wage obtained in a frictionless\nmarket and we use this to order the workers and obtain the type distribution. Likewise, we can obtain\nan order of the firms by the level of wages that they pay. The difference between the highest and\nthe lowest wage corresponds to the cost of search. Second, given the search cost, the fraction of the\nfirm population that an agent is willing to match with, i.e., the matching set, identifies the strength\nof the complementarity as expressed by the (absolute value of the) cross-partial of the production\nfunction. This is possible because the strength of the cross-partial directly reflects the output loss due\nto mismatch. We can relate our method of identification to the analysis in Gautier and Teulings (2004,\n2006) of second-order approximations to infinite-horizon search models. We show that identification\nis ensured without knowledge of the sorting pattern, without approximations to the case of negligible\nsearch costs, and in the presence of type-dependent costs, and we can do this in few transparent steps.\nBut this comes at the cost of simplified economic and econometric modeling assumptions.\nThe setup of our economy is very simple with dynamics reduced to two periods. The objective is to\nsolve analytically what the standard infinite horizon models cannot deliver. This makes the models very\nspecific, but in section 5 we show that our insights extend to the fully dynamic steady state models.\nWe also discuss alternative models and argue that whenever wages reflect the competitively determined\noutside option, they must necessarily be non-monotonic in firm type.\nRelated Literature. Given the importance of sorting, a large body of recent empirical literature\nhas estimated whether sorting is positive or negative. As mentioned above, this renewed interest has\nbeen catalyzed by the availability of worker-firm match data, surveyed e.g., in Postel-Vinay and Robin\n(2006). Using the AKM method, several papers find an insignificant or even negative correlation in\nfixed effects between worker and firm types. This result has been replicated for a number of countries\nincluding France, US, Denmark and Brazil. The result is taken as indication that Positive Assortative\nMatching between workers and firms does not play a major role in the labor market.\nAKM use matched employer-employee data to decompose wages into different effects related to\nworker and firm characteristics. With unrestricted correlation among the effects they are able to\nestimate the firm and worker components of wages. The generality of their econometric approach\nallows for many different estimation techniques to determine each of the components. A by-product\nof their contribution is a simple empirical measure of sorting that can be obtained by estimating a\nlog-wage equation in which wages are a function of a worker fixed effect, a firm fixed effect, and an\northogonal error term: log\ud464\ud456\ud461 = \ud44e\ud456\ud461\ud6fd+\ud6ff\ud456+\ud713\ud457(\ud456,\ud461) +\ud700\ud456\ud461, where \ud464\ud456\ud461 denotes the wage, \ud44e\ud456\ud461 are time varying\nobservables of workers, \ud6ff\ud456 is a worker fixed effect, \ud713\ud457 is the fixed effect of the firm \ud457 at which worker \ud456\nis employed at time \ud461, and \ud700\ud456\ud461 is an orthogonal residual. That is, \ud713\ud457 captures the average effect that a\nfirm has on the wages of the workers that are willing to match with it. The correlation between \ud6ff\ud456 and\n\ud713\ud457 in a given match is taken as an estimate of the degree of sorting.\nWe show in our theoretical exercise that the assumption that the firm effect is independent of the\n3\nworker\u2019s type is theoretically not justified in this setting. In particular, for those workers who are\nmatched with a firm that has a lower rank than their own, the wage increases when the firm type\nincreases because the worker-firm \u201cfit\u201d improves. In contrast, workers who are matched with a higher\nranked firm see a decrease in the wage when the firm becomes better because the worker-firm \u201cfit\u201d\ndeteriorates. We argue above that this implies that the correlation between the firm and worker fixed\neffect cannot be taken as a measure of sorting.\nThe AKM findings have been extensively cited in the literature. In the first instance, the method-\nology has been widely used to analyze sorting for many different countries. It has repeatedly been\nestablished in many matched employer-employee data that there is a small, or insignificant correlation\nbetween the worker and firm fixed effects. The methodology has also been extended to include different\naspects of sorting. For example, Combes, Duranton, Gobillon (2008) use the AKM methodology to\nestimate the geographical degree of sorting.\nIn addition, there is an extensive literature leaning on the AKM (1999) fixed effects regression, both\nin empirical and theoretical work. The fact that the correlation between the worker and firm fixed effect\nis small is interpreted in different ways. For example in empirical work, Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002)\nanalyze wage heterogeneity in a search model. They have no complementarities within occupations and\ncite AKM as evidence for the absence of sorting. In contrast, Bender and von Wachter (2006) argue\nthat the small but significant correlation coefficient obtained for the French labor market is indeed\nevidence in favor of sorting. Similarly, theoretical work citing the results of AKM interpret them either\nway. Anderson and Smith (2010) for example justify the absence of sorting to motivate a matching\nmodel with learning that does not generate sorting in equilibrium. They cite AKM as evidence. Shimer\n(2005) justifies the use of complementarities and the resulting sorting based on AKM despite them\nfinding a small effect. The interpretation is that the workers\u2019 unobserved characteristics have a small\nbut statistically significant effect on firm profits, i.e., there is sorting. Cabrales, Calvo\u00b4-Armengol and\nPavoni (2008) also cite AKM to argue that the degree of sorting is on the increase over time.\nBeyond the use and citation of the AKM method and results, other work has singled out shortcom-\nings of the fixed effects regression. Simulations of search models with strong complementarities and\nsorting nonetheless generate small or even negative correlations of the simulated fixed effects of workers\nand firms. Lopes de Melo (2008), Lise, Meghir and Robin (2008), and Bagger and Lentz (2008) study\nvariations of structural labor search models with an infinite horizon, and simulate as well as estimate\nthose models with matched employer-employee data. Our objective is to provide a much simpler frame-\nwork, but one that allows us to investigate theoretically how to measure the extent of sorting and to\nderive the correlation between fixed effects analytically. Lopes de Melo (2008) also reports correlations\nbetween worker fixed effects as a measure of sorting, and our approach highlights why this captures\nsome (but not all) the relevant information on the importance of sorting. In particular, it captures the\nrange in which workers accept jobs, since a narrow acceptance range means that the workers at a firm\nare rather similar. This arises when sorting is very important, but may also arise simply because search\ncosts are small, and a careful consideration of both forces is necessary.\nAnd in an approach related to our own, Gautier and Teulings (2004, 2006) allow for an infinite\nhorizon and a richer econometric environment with measurement error while relying on second-order\napproximations. They restrict the match surplus function to insure that matching is positive assortative,\n4\nand thus cannot address whether their framework permits the identification of the sign or the strength\nif that restriction were relaxed. Given our results, we suspect that recovering the sign will be infeasible\neven in their model.2 On the other hand their estimates about the strength of sorting will remain\nvalid even if one is agnostic about the matching patterns, as long as search costs are type-independent\n(below, we develop alternatives for type-dependent search costs within our framework). Thus, we\nbelieve that there is a multitude of ways (such as our approach, Gautier and Teuling\u2019s second-order\napproximations, or other approaches under sign restrictions) that allow progress on the main policy-\nrelevant issue without relying on the exact knowledge of the sorting pattern (for which additional data\nmight be required). We return to this in the discussion section.\nOne alternative approach is to use profit data in addition to wage data. Clearly, if we have infor-\nmation on prices from both sides of the market, we know the total output for all matched pairs and\ntherefore the technology. This immediately allows us to back out both the sign and the strength of\nsorting. This approach has been taken by Haltiwanger, Lane and Speltzer (1999), van den Berg and\nvan Vuuren (2003), Mendes, van den Berg, Lindeboom (2007) to estimate the performance of search\nmodels. With sorting, this immediately leads to identification. The problem is that in practice this is\ndifficult because output and profit measures are usually only provided at the level of the firm or the\nestablishment, and attributing them to each individual worker is difficult. In the absence of job level\nprofit data, one would need a theory of the firm with heterogenous agents (for example Eeckhout and\nPinheiro (2009)) to attribute the firm level profits to each individual job. Instead, the objective of our\npaper is to investigate the extent to which the two questions above can be answered from wage data\nalone. This has the great advantage that data on wages is available for each individual worker and is\nof high quality.\nFinally, there is also an extensive literature on hedonic models that are thought to be not identified.\nHedonic models characterize the pricing of goods that consist of bundles of attributes (housing, for\nexample). The focus is on multidimensional characteristics and the patterns of sorting based on those\ncharacteristics. Recently, Ekeland, Heckman and Nesheim (2002, 2004) show that the hedonic model is\ngenerically nonparametrically identified, despite the fact that the sorting equilibrium in a single market\nimplies no exclusion restrictions. They show that the commonly used linearization strategies cause\nthe identification problem because the hedonic model is generically nonlinear. In this class of models\nwith multidimensional characteristics, Dupuy (2010) observes that in a combined matching-hedonic\nmodel with sorting on both skills and preferences, wages are a function of both preferences and worker\nattributes. This can result in non-positive dependence of wages on firm types since the firm types do\nnot constitute a complete order common to all agents. Of course, one can make this observation even\nin the simple matching model by relaxing the monotonicity assumption, i.e., output is not everywhere\nincreasing in firm and\/or worker type (see also section 5).\n2We discuss the case of discounting explicitly in Section 5. Allowing for discounting rather than fixed search costs will\nopen some avenue for sign-identification, but this possibility vanishes with a decreasing discount rate between matching\nopportunities, which is assumed in most approximation-strategies.\n5\n2 The Model\nThe basic primitives of our simple matching model build on Becker (1973). There is a unit mass of\nworkers and a unit mass of firms. Workers and firms are heterogeneous in terms of their productivity.\nWorkers draw their type \ud465 from distribution \u0393(\ud465) with smooth density \ud6fe(\ud465) on [0, 1]. Firms draw their\ntype \ud466 from distribution \u03a5(\ud466) with smooth density \ud710(\ud466) on [0, 1].\nWhen types \ud465 and \ud466 form a match, they produce positive output \ud453(\ud465, \ud466) \u2265 0 whilst having an\noutside option of remaining unmatched. We assume that workers and firms can be ranked in terms\nof their productivity, i.e., \ud453\ud465 > 0 and \ud453\ud466 > 0. Then it is without loss of generality to index a worker\nby his rank in terms of productivity, i.e., by the fraction of workers that are less productive then him.\nSimilarly, we can identify each firm by its rank in the distribution of firm productivities. This means\nthat \u0393(\u22c5) = \u03a5(\u22c5) = \ud465, i.e., the distributions are uniform. Assume that workers who do not get matched\nobtain a payoff of zero, and since output is non-negative, all agents will prefer to match.\nFor the assignment of workers to firms the cross-partial of the production function is important. We\ndo not restrict the sign of the cross-partial since this will be instrumental in determining whether there\nis positive or negative assortative matching. Denote by \u2131 the class of all functions \ud453 that are monotonic:\n\ud453\ud465, \ud453\ud466 > 0; and that have a monotonic marginal product: \ud453\ud465\ud466(\ud465, \ud466) is either always positive or always\nnegative.3 The assumption that the cross-partial does not change sign allows us to unambiguously talk\nabout positive or negative sorting. Production functions with complementarities (\ud453\ud465\ud466 > 0) are in set\n\u2131+ \u2282 \u2131 . Production functions with substitutes (\ud453\ud465\ud466 < 0) are in set \u2131\u2212 \u2282 \u2131 .\nTo illustrate the implications of our analysis we will illustrate our results for the following examples\nof production functions\n\ud453+(\ud465, \ud466) = \ud6fc\ud465\ud703\ud466\ud703 + \u210e(\ud465) + \ud454(\ud466), (1)\n\ud453\u2212(\ud465, \ud466) = \ud6fc\ud465\ud703(1\u2212 \ud466)\ud703 + \u210e(\ud465) + \ud454(\ud466), (2)\nwhere \ud454(\u22c5) and \u210e(\u22c5) are increasing functions and \ud6fc \u2265 0 and \ud703 > 0 are parameters that indicate the\nstrength of the complementarities. We assume that \ud454(\ud466) is such that higher type firms produce higher\noutput even under the second specification. It is obvious that \ud453+ \u2208 \u2131+ and \ud453\u2212 \u2208 \u2131\u2212.\n2.1 The Frictionless Environment\nIn the absence of frictions the matching market is competitive. An assignment of workers \ud465 to firms \ud466 is\ndenoted by \ud707, i.e., \ud707(\ud465) = \ud466 means that worker \ud465 gets hired by firm \ud466. A market equilibrium specifies an\nassignment \ud707 between \ud465\u2019s and \ud466\u2019s and some wage schedule \ud464(\ud465, \ud466) that determines the split of output\nbetween the worker and the firm that are matched. The payoff to the worker is \ud464(\ud465, \ud466) and the payoff\nto the firm is \ud70b(\ud465, \ud466) = \ud453 (\ud465, \ud466) \u2212 \ud464(\ud465, \ud466). Both workers and firms take the wage schedule as given.\nThe tuple of functions (\ud707,\ud464) is an equilibrium if there is no worker-firm pair that could do better by\nmatching amongst themselves than with their current partners,4 i.e.,\n\ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)) + \ud70b(\ud707\u22121(\ud466), \ud466) \u2265 \ud453(\ud465, \ud466), \u2200\ud465, \ud466 (3)\n3Later, in section 5 we discuss the virtues of relaxing these assumptions.\n4It is well-known that a strict cross-partial yields a one-to-one mapping \ud707(\u22c5) in equilibrium. In general \ud707(\u22c5) is a\ncorrespondence, with the equilibrium definition extended to all pairs in that correspondence.\n6\nand no agent prefers to remain single, i.e., \ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)) \u2265 0 for all \ud465 and \ud70b(\ud707\u22121(\ud466), \ud466) \u2265 0 for all \ud466.\nWe derive the main prediction of Becker\u2019s (1973) model concerning the wages in the economy.\nRearranging (3) such that only profits are on the left hand side and recalling that \ud70b(\ud465, \ud466) = \ud453 (\ud465, \ud466)\u2212\n\ud464(\ud465, \ud466) immediately reveals the equilibrium profits for firm \ud466 must satisfy:\nmax\n\ud465\n\ud453(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)).\nThis yields the first order condition\n\ud453\ud465(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \ud451\ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465))\n\ud451\ud465\n= 0. (4)\nIn equilibrium this has to hold evaluated at \ud466 = \ud707(\ud465), and therefore the equilibrium wage scedule\n\ud464\u2605(\ud465) := \ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)) can be obtained by integrating (4) along the equilibrium path:\n\ud464\u2605(\ud465) =\n\u222b \ud465\n0\n\ud453\ud465(\ud465\u02dc, \ud707(\ud465\u02dc))\ud451\ud465\u02dc+ \ud4640, (5)\nwhere the constant of integration \ud4640 \u2208 [0,min \ud453(\ud465, \ud466)] can be thought of as some exogenous bargaining\nrule that splits the surplus between the lowest types in case these types have a positive surplus over\nremaining single.5 Observe that the worker obtains exactly his marginal product along the equilibrium\nallocation. Therefore, equilibrium profits of type \ud466 are given by output minus the wage \ud464\u2605 with the\noptimal worker \ud707\u22121(\ud466). This can be re-written as\n\ud70b\u2605(\ud466) =\n\u222b \ud466\n0\n\ud453\ud466(\ud707\n\u22121(\ud466\u02dc), \ud466\u02dc)\ud451\ud466\u02dc + \ud453(0, 0)\u2212 \ud4640. (6)\nFurthermore, we know from Becker\u2019s analysis that matching is positive assortative when the production\nfunction is supermodular (\ud453\ud465\ud466 > 0), in which case \ud707(\ud465) = \ud465. Under submodularity (\ud453\ud465\ud466 < 0) in\nequilibrium the matching is negative assortative and \ud707(\ud465) = 1\u2212 \ud465, since lower type firms have a higher\nmarginal value for better workers and are willing to pay more for them.\n2.2 On the equilibrium path\nWe show that in this simple competitive model the sign of sorting \u2013 i.e., the sign of the cross-partial\n\u2013 cannot be identified from wage data alone. We will first illustrate the result by considering our\nrestricted class of production functions outlined above and then present the general theorem. Suppose\nthe underlying production technology is not known and the true technology is either one of the two\nexample technologies \ud453+ given in (1) or \ud453\u2212 given in (2). By (5) the wages under \ud453+ and \ud453\u2212 are\n\ud464\u2605,+(\ud465) =\n\u222b \ud465\n0\n\ud453+\ud465 (\ud465\u02dc, \ud465\u02dc)\ud451\ud465\u02dc+ \ud4640 =\n\ud6fc\n2\n\ud4652\ud703 + \u210e(\ud465)\u2212 \u210e(0) + \ud4640\n\ud464\u2605,\u2212(\ud465) =\n\u222b \ud465\n0\n\ud453\u2212\ud465 (\ud465\u02dc, 1\u2212 \ud465\u02dc)\ud451\ud465\u02dc+ \ud4640 =\n\ud6fc\n2\n\ud4652\ud703 + \u210e(\ud465)\u2212 \u210e(0) + \ud4640.\n5When \ud453(0, 0) = 0, then \ud4640 = 0 and the wage schedule is uniquely determined. Otherwise there are a continuum of\ncompetitive equilibria associated with different \ud4640, and we assume that the specific split \ud4640 is a primitive determined by\nsome exogenous bargaining rule.\n7\n\uf066\uf02b \uf03d \uf078\uf079 \uf02b \uf079 \uf066\uf000 \uf03d \uf078\uf028\uf031\uf000 \uf079\uf029 \uf02b \uf079\n\uf078\uf032\n\uf032\n\uf078\uf032\n\uf032\n\uf078\uf032\n\uf032 \uf02b \uf078\n\uf078\uf032\n\uf032 \uf02b \uf031\uf000 \uf078\n\uf078\uf032 \uf02b \uf078 \uf078\uf032 \uf02b \uf031\uf000 \uf078\n\uf078\uf032\n\uf032\n0.0 0.5 1.0\n0\n1\n2\nx\n0.0 0.5 1.0\n0\n1\n2\nx\n\uf031\n\uf066\uf02b \uf03d \uf078\uf079 \uf02b \uf079 \uf066\uf000 \uf03d \uf078\uf028\uf031\uf000 \uf079\uf029 \uf02b \uf079\n\uf078\uf032\n\uf032\n\uf078\uf032\n\uf032\n\uf078\uf032\n\uf032 \uf02b \uf078\n\uf078\uf032\n\uf032 \uf02b \uf031\uf000 \uf078\n\uf078\uf032 \uf02b \uf078 \uf078\uf032 \uf02b \uf031\uf000 \uf078\n\uf078\uf032\n\uf032\n0.0 0.5 1.0\n0\n1\n2\nx\n0.0 0.5 1.0\n0\n1\n2\nx\n\uf031\nFigure 1: The solid line gives equilibrium wages \ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)), the dashed line profits \ud70b(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)), and the\ndotted line total output \ud453(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)) under \ud453+ = \ud465\ud466 + \ud466 [left] and \ud453\u2212 = \ud465(1\u2212 \ud466) + \ud466 [right] with \ud4640 = 0.\nUnder both technologies the wages on the equilibrium path are exactly identical, and from wage data\nalone one cannot distinguish between positive and negative sorting. The problem is obtaining the order\nof the firms. If we only have wage data and no profit data, and we derive the order on the firms by\nranking them by increasing wages, we will obtain two different orders depending on whether we have\ncomplements or substitutes. To see this, observe that under positive assortative matching (henceforth\nPAM) higher type firms pay higher wages along the equilibrium path whereas under negative assortative\nmatching (NAM) higher type firms pay lower wages. In the former \ud464(\ud466, \ud466) = \ud6fc\ud466\n2\ud703\n2 is increasing in \ud466,\nin the latter \ud464(1 \u2212 \ud466, \ud466) = \ud6fc(1\u2212\ud466)2\ud7032 is decreasing in \ud466. This result is true for any general production\ntechnology as summarized in the proposition that follows below.\nIn Figure 1 the solid line shows for each worker \ud465 his wage, the dashed line shows the profits of the\nfirm that is matched to worker \ud465, and the dotted line gives the total output that they produce. The left\npanel depicts these for the production function \ud453+ = \ud465\ud466+ \ud466, while the right panel covers the outcomes\nfor production function \ud453\u2212 = \ud465(1 \u2212 \ud466) + \ud466. If one only observes the wages according to the solid line,\nboth cases look identical. The cases only differ in profits and total outputs. For example, the dashed\nline of the profits of the firm matched to worker \ud465 is decreasing in worker type \ud465 only under \ud453\u2212. While\nhigher \ud466 firms have higher profits, in this case higher \ud465 workers are matched with lower \ud466 firms who\nobtain lower profits. That is, even under NAM \ud70b\u2605,\u2212(\ud466) = \ud466 + (1\u2212\ud466)\n2\n2 is increasing in \ud466 even though\n\ud70b\u2212(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)) is decreasing in \ud465. The payoffs under both technologies are summarized in the following\ntable.\n\ud453+ = \ud465\ud466 + \ud466 \ud453\u2212 = \ud465(1\u2212 \ud466) + \ud466\n\ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465) \ud465\n2\n2\n\ud4652\n2\n\ud70b(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)) \ud465\n2\n2 + \ud465\n\ud4652\n2 + 1\u2212 \ud465\n\ud453(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)) \ud4652 + \ud465 \ud4652 + 1\u2212 \ud465\n8\nProposition 1 For any production function \ud453 \u2208 \u2131+ that induces positive sorting there exists a pro-\nduction function \ud453 \u2208 \u2131\u2212 that induces negative sorting and the equilibrium wages \ud464\u2217(\ud465) are identical\nunder both production functions.\nProof. In Appendix.\n2.3 Off the equilibrium path\nIdentification needs variation. Identification of sorting from equilibrium wages may be difficult simply\nbecause there is no independent variation across firms and workers. In the frictionless case workers sort\nperfectly in the sense that each type of firm attracts exactly one worker type. Even if workers became\nunemployed and could match again later without frictions, the panel dimension would not allow us to\nidentify a separate effect for firms and workers, because workers will always end up in the same type of\nfirm. There would not be any wage variation, and it cannot be identified whether a high wage is due\nto the worker ability or the firm productivity.\nHere we entertain the idea that workers \u201ctremble\u201d to off-the-equilibrium firms. Without specifying\nhow those wages are determined, we start from the premise that such off-equilibrium wages are observed\noccasionally. This gives additional variation that one might suspect to be crucial for identification. This\nsimple exposition is also useful to build intuition for the results in more realistic environments because\nit has a close connection to the mismatch that occurs under search frictions, as will become clear in the\nnext section.\nAnd even though those wages obtained when \u201ctrembling\u201d are not equilibrium wages, they must not\ninduce agents on the equilibrium allocation to deviate. Therefore, those wages \ud464(\ud465, \ud466) must satisfy the\non-the-equilibrium path restriction (3) as before: \ud453(\ud465, \ud466) = \ud464(\ud465, \ud466) + \ud70b(\ud465, \ud466) \u2264 \ud464(\ud465, \ud707) + \ud70b(\ud707\u22121, \ud466). A\ncondition with more bite is obtained by requiring for a given wage schedule \ud464(\ud465, \ud466) that there should\nbe no individual deviation by either worker or firm type:\n\ud453(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \ud464(\ud465, \ud466) \u2264 \ud70b(\ud707\u22121(\ud466), \ud466) (7)\n\ud464(\ud465, \ud466) \u2264 \ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)). (8)\nThis is the standard competitive equilibrium notion of a matching market, in which each agent takes\nthe price (here: wage) schedule as given and assumes that he can obtain a partner at this transfer price.\nFor markets to clear the price has to be such that no agent individually wants to choose a different\npartner.\nFor a given (\ud465, \ud466) combination, call the set of wages that are consistent with (7) and (8) \ud44a (\ud465, \ud466).\nThis wage schedule is not uniquely determined and wages range between the lowest wage that is just\nhigh enough to prevent firms from deviating and the highest wage that is just low enough to prevent\nworkers from deviating.\nIt is important to note the implication of (8): wages are highest at the firm that is most appropriate\nfor the worker. Even under positive assortative matching, a worker \ud465 who tries to trade with a firm\nthat is higher (or lower) than his optimal type \ud707(\ud465) will earn lower wages. At less productive firms this\narises for the obvious reason that the surplus is too low. At more productive firms this arises because\n9\nthe firm forgoes the benefit of hiring the more appropriate worker and has to be compensated for this\nopportunity cost.\nEven with observation of wages from mismatched pairs, we cannot determine the sign of sorting. It\nis easily verified that in the case of the technology \ud453+(\ud465, \ud466) any wage \ud464(\ud465, \ud466) in \ud44a (\ud465, \ud466) satisfies\n\ud6fc (\ud465\ud466)\ud703 \u2212 \ud6fc\n2\n\ud4662\ud703 \u2264 \ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \u210e(\ud465) \u2264 \ud6fc\n2\n\ud4652\ud703. (9)\nIn the case of \ud453\u2212(\ud465, \ud466) any wage \ud464(\ud465, \ud466) in \ud44a (\ud465, \ud466) satisfies\n\ud6fc\ud465\ud703(1\u2212 \ud466)\ud703 \u2212 \ud6fc\n2\n(1\u2212 \ud466)2\ud703 \u2264 \ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \u210e(\ud465) \u2264 \ud6fc\n2\n\ud4652\ud703, (10)\nwhich is identical to (9) if we misinterpret the types as \ud466\u02c6 = 1\u2212 \ud466. If we have no information on profits,\nas before we cannot derive the order on \ud466 simply from wage data, not even after observing off-the-\nequilibrium path wages. The bounds on the wages under PAM and NAM are identical if we use the\norder on wages to derive the order on \ud466 (in which case under NAM we assign the order 1 \u2212 \ud466 to the\nfirms). The static Beckerian model will therefore not allow for identification of assortative matching\nbased on wage data alone.\nProposition 2 For any production function \ud453 \u2208 \u2131+ that induces positive sorting there exists a pro-\nduction function \ud453 \u2208 \u2131\u2212 that induces negative sorting and the equilibrium wage sets \ud44a (\ud465, \ud466) in the\nformer are identical to equilibrium wage set \ud44a (\ud465, 1\u2212 \ud466) in the latter.\nProof. The proof follows the same argument as in Proposition 1.\n3 Mismatch due to Search Frictions\nWe now consider an extended model with mismatch due to frictions caused by delay. Search frictions\ngive a structural reason why workers may match with firms even if these firms would not be exactly\noptimal in the absence of frictions. Unlike the static Beckerian model, search frictions may induce\ndifferent behavior in the acceptance decision of matches. First, we derive the equilibrium allocation\nin the presence of search costs. We relate this to the previous section and find that there is a strong\nresemblance, even though the search frictions give an explicit bound on the mismatch that prevents very\ninefficient matches to materialize. We address the issue of identification of positive\/negative sorting\nin this model, and whether we can identify the sign of sorting from wage data alone. Second, for this\nmodel we analytically derive the firm fixed-effect. We postpone the discussion of identification of the\nstrength of sorting to the next section.\n3.1 Introducing Search Costs\nOur model has hiring in two stages. In stage one, each worker is paired with one firm. The pairings\nare random. One can think of this part of the hiring process as standing in for some connections that\nworkers have to the labor market prior to engaging in an extensive search for jobs. The pair can either\nagree to stay together at some wage, or search for a better partner. Firms have fixed types and cannot\nexit and reenter to take another draw. Those pairs who decide not to stay together each incur a search\n10\ncost \ud450 due to the delay. The formulation with a constant search cost follows Chade (2001) and Atakan\n(2006). In the second stage, all remaining agents are matched according to the competitive, frictionless\nallocation as outlined above.6 After the search process has ended production starts. To allow for a\npanel dimension in the observations (i.e., over time, each worker matches with more than one firm, and\neach firm matches with more than one worker) we assume that each agent goes through this two-stages\nhiring process several times in his life.\nWe consider the same class of production functions \u2131 . For exposition it will be convenient to\nrestrict the supermodular function in \u2131+ to functions with symmetric cross-partial such that \ud453\ud465\ud466(\ud465, \ud466) =\n\ud453\ud465\ud466(\ud466, \ud465). For submodular functions in \u2131\u2212 which induce negative sorting it will be convenient to restrict\nattention to symmetry of the form \ud453\ud465\ud466(\ud465, \ud466) = \ud453\ud465\ud466(1\u2212 \ud466, 1\u2212 \ud465).\nWe assume that the transfer in the first period is determined by Nash bargaining with equal bar-\ngaining weights. We illustrate this with our example production function \ud453+ in (1). When a worker\n\ud465 meets a firm \ud466, the payoff from matching is \ud453(\ud465, \ud466). Waiting until next period and matching in the\nperfectly competitive labor market yields payoff \ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)) \u2212 \ud450 to the worker and \ud70b(\ud707\u22121(\ud466), \ud466) \u2212 \ud450 to\nthe firm. A first-period match will therefore be accepted provided that the current match surplus over\nwaiting is positive. This gives the following bounds on the degree of mismatch where a match is still\ntolerated:7\n\ud453(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 (\ud464\u2605(\ud465) + \ud70b\u2605(\ud466)\u2212 2\ud450) \u2265 0. (11)\nFor a given firm \ud466 we call the set of worker types that fulfill (11) his acceptance set and denote it by\n\ud434(\ud466) for the firms and by \ud435(\ud465) for the workers.8 Similar to the work by Atakan (2006) we can show\nthat the bounds of this set are increasing if the production function is in \u2131+ and decreasing if it is in\n\u2131\u2212, which naturally extends the notion of sorting to sets.\nFor our example production function \ud453+ in (1) it is easy to verify that (11) reduces to\n\ud6fc(\ud465\ud466)\ud703 \u2212 \ud6fc\n2\n\ud4652\ud703 \u2212 \ud6fc\n2\n\ud4662\ud703 \u2265 \u22122\ud450. (12)\nand therefore the acceptance set becomes \ud434(\ud466) =\n[\n(\ud466\ud703 \u2212 2\u221a\ud450\/\ud6fc)1\/\ud703, (\ud466\ud703 + 2\u221a\ud450\/\ud6fc)1\/\ud703] . Due to sym-\nmetry the acceptance set of the workers looks identical. The range of mutually accepted matches is\nillustrated by the area between the dashed lines in Figure 2 for the case \ud703 = 1.\n6Here we need to worry about the possibility that when the acceptance sets span the entire type space (e.g., because of\nhigh search costs or low complementarities), no agents are left in the second stage, in which case the continuation payoff is\nnot determined. Without modeling this explicitly, we think of a tremble that ensures that there are always some agents\nwho end up in the next period. For many parameters each worker and firm type rejects some agents on the other side of\nthe market, and these agents will indeed move to the second stage.\n7It may well be that for low types the surplus in the next period does not exceed the total waiting cost of 2\ud450. In order\nto avoid keeping track of endogenous entry, we assume that people will search even if that is the case. This may be due to\nthe fact that the outside option (e.g. unemployment benefits) are contingent on searching. This issue never arises when\n\ud453(0, 0) \u2212 \ud4640 > \ud450 and \ud4640 > \ud450, as all agents than have an incentive to search, or when search costs are proportional as in\nSection 5.\n8Note that for supermodular functions in \u2131+ this acceptance set is identical for workers and firms of the same type,\nwhich is a general consequence of the symmetry of \ud453\ud465\ud466. Therefore the distribution of types in the second stage is identical\nfor workers and firms, and therefore the equilibrium assignment is still \ud707(\ud465) = \ud465. Similarly, for submodular functions in\n\ud439\u2212 is can be shown that under our symmetry condition when \ud465 accepts \ud466 then \ud466\u02c6 = 1\u2212 \ud465 accepts \ud465\u02c6 = 1\u2212 \ud466, which leads\nto distributions that are symmetric around 1\/2 and the equilibrium assignment indeed remains \ud707(\ud465) = 1\u2212 \ud465.\n11\nxy\n2\n\u221a\nc\n10\n1\nFigure 2: Acceptance sets with type-independent search costs for \ud703 = 1.\nBecause the surplus is divided equally, the worker obtains half of this surplus on top of his outside\noption that is given by his value of waiting. Therefore, his wage is\n\ud464(\ud465, \ud466) =\n1\n2\n[\n\ud453(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465))\u2212 \ud70b(\ud707\u22121(\ud466), \ud466) + 2\ud450]+ \ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465))\u2212 \ud450\n=\n1\n2\n[\n\ud453(\ud465, \ud466) + \ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465))\u2212 \ud70b(\ud707\u22121(\ud466), \ud466)] . (13)\nIt is straightforward to see that this wage is exactly in the middle of the acceptance set \ud44a (\ud465, \ud466)\noutlined in (7) and (8) for off-equilibrium-wages of the frictionless model. It immediately implies that\npositive and negative sorting cannot be identified by observed wage data, because the wages under\nsupermodular production functions coincide with those under submodular production functions (under\nmisinterpretation of the unobserved firm type).\nProposition 3 For every supermodular production function \ud453+ \u2208 \u2131+ that induces positive sorting\nthere is a submodular production function \ud453\u2212 \u2208 \u2131\u2212 that induces exactly the same wages for workers\nwhen we reinterpret firm types as \ud466\u02c6 = 1\u2212 \ud466.\nProof. Wages in the second period coincide by Proposition 1. Wages in the first period coincide because\nthey are in the exact arithmetric middle of the wage set \ud44a (\u22c5, \u22c5) which by Proposition (2) coincide under\nthe re-interpretation.\nFor our example production technology \ud453+ we get as wages\n\ud464(\ud465, \ud466) =\n\ud6fc\n2\n(\ud465\ud466)\ud703 +\n\ud6fc\n4\n\ud4652\ud703 \u2212 \ud6fc\n4\n\ud4662\ud703 + \u210e(\ud465).\nFor some of the results it will be instructive to rewrite the wages as a function of the distance \ud458 between\nthe worker and the firm, which for the special case of \ud703 = 1 becomes particularly tractable:\n\ud464(\ud465, \ud465\u2212 \ud458) = \ud464(\ud465, \ud465+ \ud458) = \ud6fc\n2\n\ud4652 \u2212 \ud6fc\n4\n\ud4582 + \u210e(\ud465).\n12\nFigure 3: First period wages under mismatch with a type \ud466 = \ud465 + \ud458 that is \ud458 away from the optimal\nmatch. [Parameter values \ud465 = .5, \ud450 = .25, \ud6fc = \ud703 = 1, \u210e(\ud465) = 0.]\nNow it becomes immediately apparent what we observed above: there exists an ideal firm in the\ninterior of the set of matches where wages are highest. In this example, a worker has the highest wage\nwhen matching with a firm with identical type (\ud458 = 0), and loses quadratically with the distance to the\nfirm. The reason is that a worker who matches with a firm that has too low a type does not produce a\nlot of output. On the other hand, a worker who wants to induce a much better firm to match with him\nhas to compensate the firm for not matching with a more appropriate worker. Therefore a worker is\nnot necessarily better off matching with a higher type firm. In a large region \u2013 i.e., whenever the firm\nis higher ranked than the worker \u2013 wages fall by matching with even better firms. Figure 3 illustrates\nthe wage schedule of a worker as a function of the distance to the firm he matches with, and highlights\nthe fact that the wage falls in firm type in part of the region. This result holds more generally:\nProposition 4 For each \ud465 \u2208 (0, 1) wages \ud464(\ud465, \ud466) are non-monotone in \ud466.\nProof. Wages \ud464(\ud465, \ud466) are in the exact arithmetic middle of the wage set \ud44a (\ud465, \ud466). Since worker type\n\ud465 chooses the optimal wage, by (8) any wage in \ud44a (\ud465, \ud466\u2032) is lower than the wage \ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)) under the\noptimal assignment. Since \ud44a (\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)) = \ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)) the optimal wages arise in the first stage. Because\nsearch costs are positive, all firm types close to \ud707(\ud465) have a positive surplus and thus will form a match\nwith \ud465 in the first stage. Therefore, wages are non-monotone around the optimum wage \ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)).\nNote that none of the results depend on an equal split of the surplus or identical search costs for\nworkers and firms. We consider the case of asymmetric bargaining shares and different, type-dependent\nsearch costs later. In what follows, we show that this non-monotonicity of the wage schedule makes it\nimpossible for a fixed effect estimator to detect the sign and the strength of sorting.\n3.2 Inconclusive Firm-Fixed-Effects\nIn this section we assess the ability of the fixed effects approach that we discussed in the introduction\nto detect the strength of sorting, i.e., the magnitude of the cross-partial. We already know that due to\n13\nthe non-monotonicity of equilibrium wages the correlation between worker and firm fixed effects will\nprovide a misspecified measure of the degree of complementarity. Nonetheless, one might conjecture\nthat some misspecification is unavoidable and the approach might nevertheless pick up at least the\nright qualitative properties. In this section we show for the most popular example in the literature\nthat the fixed effect of the firm does not correlate at all with its true underlying type. Therefore,\nthe correlation between worker and firm fixed effects will also be zero and uninformative about either\nthe sign or strength of sorting. This result in particular involves verifying how the boundaries of the\nacceptance sets change in types, in addition to the change in the wage profile.\nWe will consider the fixed effect approach assuming a long panel of observations for each worker and\nfirm. That is, each worker and firm goes through our two step process many times. The fixed effects\napproach decomposes the wage when worker \ud465 matches with firm \ud466 into the sum of the worker\u2019s fixed\neffects \ud6ff(\ud465) and the firm\u2019s fixed effect \ud713(\ud466) plus a residual \ud700\ud465\ud466 :\n9\n\ud464(\ud465, \ud466) = \ud6ff(\ud465) + \ud713(\ud466) + \ud700\ud465\ud466, (14)\nFor this approach, we require the fixed effects to be unbiased. We show in the appendix that this is the\ncase when\n\ud6ff(\ud465) =\n\u222b\n\ud435(\ud465)\n[\ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \ud713(\ud466)] \ud451\u03a5(\ud466\u2223\ud465), (15)\n\ud713(\ud466) =\n\u222b\n\ud434(\ud466)\n[\ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \ud6ff(\ud465)] \ud451\u0393(\ud465\u2223\ud466), (16)\nwhere \ud434(\ud466) and \ud435(\ud465) are the acceptance sets, and \u03a5(\ud466\u2223\ud465) and \u0393(\ud465\u2223\ud466) are the distributions conditional\non being in the acceptance set (with densities \ud710(\ud466\u2223\ud465) and \ud6fe(\ud465\u2223\ud466)).10 Substituting (15) into (16) we can\nwrite the firm fixed effect as\n\ud713(\ud466) =\n\u222b\n\ud434(\ud466)\n[\ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \ud464\ud44e\ud463(\ud465)] \ud451\u0393(\ud465\u2223\ud466)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n=:\u03a8(\ud466)\n+\n\u222b\n\ud434(\ud466)\n\u222b\n\ud435(\ud465)\n\ud713(\ud466\u02dc)\ud451\u03a5(\ud466\u02dc\u2223\ud465)\ud451\u0393(\ud465\u2223\ud466) (17)\nwhere \ud464\ud44e\ud463(\ud465) is the average wage of worker \ud465, defined by \ud464\ud44e\ud463(\ud465) =\n\u222b\n\ud435(\ud465)\ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\ud451\u03a5(\ud466\u2223\ud465). The fixed\neffect is therefore determined by a differential equation. This equation is governed by the characteristic\nterm \u03a8(\ud466) that captures the intuitive aspect that the firm fixed effect is the difference between the\nwage that the firm pays and the average wage that the worker receives. If the characteristic term \u03a8(\ud466)\nis constant, it is immediate that the solution to (17) yields a constant fixed effect \ud713(\ud466) that does not\nvary across firms.11 That is, in this case the fixed effect does not pick up the differential willingness to\npay by firms to hire better workers.\n9Our analysis is in levels rather than in log-wages. The same decompositions (15)\u2013(18) obtain similarly if we replaced\nthe wage by the log-wage and the average wage by the average of the log-wages, and the qualitative results that the\ncharacteristic part of the fixed effect can be increasing, zero, or decreasing depending on the exact specification of the type\ndistribution arises in a similar way. Only the exact shape of the type distribution is more complicated.\n10Let \ud44e(\ud466) = inf \ud434(\ud466) and \ud44e\u00af(\ud466) = sup\ud434(\ud466), then \u0393(\ud465\u2223\ud466) = \u0393(\ud465)\/[\u0393(\ud44e\u00af(\ud466))\u2212 \u0393(\ud44e(\ud466))]. Similar for \u03a5(\ud466\u2223\ud465).\n11The characteristic term \u03a8(\ud466) is constant iff it is zero because the integral over the wages minus the average wage is\nzero. Then (17) is solved trivially when \ud713(\ud466) equals zero.\n14\nTo show that fixed effects are not suited to analyze sorting in this model, we consider a version of\nour example production function: \ud453(\ud465, \ud466) = \ud6fc\ud465\ud466 + \u210e(\ud465) + \ud454(\ud466), where \ud6fc > 0. This yields acceptance\nsets of form \ud434(\ud466) = [\ud466\u2212\ud43e, \ud466+\ud43e] with \ud43e = 2\u221a\ud450\/\ud6fc. These acceptance sets are independent of the type\ndistributions \u0393 and \u03a5. To preserve the simple structure of the acceptance set for illustration purposes,\nit will be convenient to allow the type distribution to possibly be non-uniform at this point rather than\nto normalize them and to change the production function accordingly.\nFor this example we will calculate how the characteristic part of the fixed effect \u03a8(\ud466) changes in\n\ud466. For the formal analysis of the characteristic part we focus on firms \ud466 \u2208 (2\ud43e, 1\u2212 2\ud43e), because their\nacceptance set as well as the acceptance sets of the workers they match with is in the interior of the\ntype space. That will avoid cumbersome discussions of corner properties, which can be shown to have\nnegligible impact if \ud450 is small. In the interior part we obtain\n\u03a8\u2032(\ud466) =\n\u222b \ud466+\ud43e\n\ud466\u2212\ud43e\n\u2202\ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\n\u2202\ud466\n\ud6fe(\ud465\u2223\ud466)\ud451\ud465 (18)\n+ (\ud464(\ud466 +\ud43e, \ud466)\u2212 \ud464\ud44e\ud463(\ud466 +\ud43e)) \ud6fe(\ud466 +\ud43e\u2223\ud466)\n\u2212 (\ud464(\ud466 \u2212\ud43e, \ud466)\u2212 \ud464\ud44e\ud463(\ud466 \u2212\ud43e)) \ud6fe(\ud466 \u2212\ud43e\u2223\ud466).\nCall the first term \u03a8\u20321(\ud466) and the second and third term \u03a8\u20322(\ud466) so that \u03a8\u2032(\ud466) = \u03a8\u20321(\ud466) + \u03a8\u20322(\ud466). The\nfirst term \u03a8\u20321(\ud466) accounts for the wage change across those workers with which this firm type matches.\nThe second and third term \u03a8\u20322(\ud466) reflect that the matching set is slightly changing when the firm type\nchanges.\nWe obtain the following results when the type distribution has a linear density:12\n\u03a8\u20321(\ud466) > 0 if \ud6fe\n\u2032(\ud465\u2223\ud466) > 0 for all \ud466; (19)\n\u03a8\u20322(\ud466) < 0 if \ud6fe\n\u2032(\ud465\u2223\ud466) > 0 for all \ud466. (20)\nThe first effect arises because the wage change induced by a higher firm type is non-monotonic: \u2202\ud464(\ud465,\ud466)\u2202\ud466 =\n\ud6fc\n2\ud465\u2212 \ud6fc2 \ud466, decreasing when \ud465 < \ud466 and increasing when \ud465 > \ud466. In this case it depends whether there are\nmore high or low worker types to determine which effect dominates, and for uniform type distributions\nthis effect is exactly zero.13 In general this first effect is counteracted by the second effect that arises\nbecause the boundaries of the acceptance set change. Low types leave the acceptance set and high types\njoin it. At the boundaries workers earn the lowest wages, and therefore an increasing density means\nthat the firm gains more low wage workers than it loses and its fixed effect tends to decrease, while for\nopposite density it loses more low types than it gains high types and its fixed effect increases. We show\nthis formally in the Appendix. Again this effect is zero if the type distribution is uniform.\n12Linear densities imply that the conditional density is constant in the sense that \ud710\u2032(\ud466\u2223\ud465) = \ud45f for some constant \ud45f, since\nthe acceptance sets of constant size 2\ud43e. For symmetric distributions \u0393(\u22c5) = \u03a5(\u22c5) this means that \ud710\u2032(\ud466\u2223\ud465) = \ud6fe\u2032(\ud465\u2223\ud466) = \ud45f .\nThe first result also obtains for any other type distribution.\n13For the uniform distribution we have\n\u03a8\u20321(\ud466) =\n1\n2\ud43e\n\u222b \ud466+\ud43e\n\ud466\u2212\ud43e\n(\ud6fc\n2\n\ud465\u2212 \ud6fc\n2\n\ud466\n)\n\ud451\ud465 =\n1\n2\ud43e\n\u222b \ud43e\n\u2212\ud43e\n(\ud6fc\n2\n(\ud466 + \ud458)\u2212 \ud6fc\n2\n\ud466\n)\n\ud451\ud458 = 0.\nNote also that the first effect does not depend on linear densities of the type distributions, but holds in general.\n15\nTherefore, in this simple example with a multiplicative production function (which generates positive\nsorting) and uniform type distributions, the fixed effect of the firm is not correlated with its true type.\nIt is independent of its true type, and the only variation might arise from small sample properties that\nintroduce non-systematic noise. While for uniform distributions the fixed effect does not vary with the\ntype of the firm at all, it is possible to find type distributions that generate a fixed effect that is either\ndecreasing, increasing, or non-monotone in the type of the firm. The reason is that taking out the\nworker effect from the firm effect in (15) means that a high-paying firm might have a low fixed effect\nbecause it employs mainly highly paid workers, rendering this identification strategy insufficient to back\nout the type of the firm. Our main conclusion is that even in a model with sorting we can analytically\nshow that the firm fixed effect is not sensitive to the firms\u2019 true type. Whether sorting is positive or\nnegative, the fixed effect is in general ambiguous and can be zero.\n4 Identifying the Strength of Sorting\nWe have shown that even in the simplest model it is not possible to distinguish negative from positive\nsorting from wage data alone, and that in a Beckerian model of the world, fixed effects estimation not\nonly fails to identify the sign but also the strength of sorting. This raises the question whether the\nstrength of sorting can be identified at all from wage data. In economic terms this is the more pressing\nissue rather than finding the sign of sorting (positive or negative) since welfare depends on matching the\nright types by avoiding inefficient mismatch, not on who these types are. For the purpose of the exercise\nwe take the model literally, and see whether the model-generated data together with the assumption of\na large panel allows for identification of the strength of sorting.\nWe will show that the identification of the strength of sorting can be obtained. Identification does\nnot rely on the exact simplifying assumptions we made in the previous section, but obtains even when\nsome of these assumptions are relaxed. Consider a generalization of the basic model, now with general,\ntype-dependent search cost functions and different bargaining shares for workers and firms. Search\ncosts might differ between workers and firms, and they vary with the type of the agent \ud465 or \ud466. Also\nbargaining shares might not be equal. Denote by \ud450(\ud465) the cost of search to the worker of type \ud465 and\nby \ud458(\ud466) the cost of having job \ud466 unfilled. The worker\u2019s share of the bargaining surplus is denoted by\n\ud6fe \u2208 (0, 1).\nWe maintain the assumptions on \ud453(\ud465, \ud466) from section 3 (symmetric cross-partials in particular).\nTo keep exposition tractable, we will also make assumptions on the search costs that ensure that\nmatching bands are symmetric and monotone, and that higher types indeed get more when they have\nto wait for the second period. Symmetry implies that second-period wages are exactly the same as in\nthe frictionless matching model. The entire analysis goes through even without symmetric matching\nbands, but the algebra becomes much more involved. The following assumption is sufficient to ensure\nthis: \ud450\u2032(\ud465) = \ud458\u2032(\ud465) < \ud453\ud465(\ud465, \ud465) in the case of PAM, and \ud450\u2032(\ud465) = \u2212\ud458\u2032(1\u2212 \ud465) < \ud453\ud465(\ud465, 1\u2212 \ud465) in the case of\nNAM. The equality ensures marginal cost symmetry and thereby the symmetry of the matching bands,\nthe inequality ensures that second period wages minus the costs of search are increasing in type, which\nimplies that higher worker types always get higher wages than lower worker types.14 We also assume\n14Differentiating the wages in (26) establishes this.\n16\nmonotone matching bands which obtains if costs do not change too rapidly by type.15 The motivation\nfor this assumption is that it allows us to use the wages to order the firms meaningfully, despite the\nfact that we cannot identify which firms are the more productive ones. While we show in Section 5\nthat we can dispense with the symmetry assumption alltogether and how one can get identification\neven if matching sets are non-monotone, the current specification allows for a particularly tractable\nmathematical exposition.16\nWe develop a simple procedure to identify the degree of complementarity of the production tech-\nnology \ud453(\ud465, \ud466). What we are after is to identify the magnitude of the cross-partial \u2223\ud453\ud465\ud466\u2223 in absolute\nvalue, which turns out to be the key determinant for the efficiency loss due to mismatch. The procedure\nmakes use of two pieces of independent information that jointly identify the two fundamentals of the\neconomy, the search costs \ud450(\ud465), \ud458(\ud466) and the match surplus function \ud453(\ud465, \ud466):\n1. The size of the wage gap: the difference between the highest and the lowest wage a given worker\ntype receives. The wage gap allows us to identify the cost of search since the marginal wage offer\nmust make the worker indifferent between accepting and rejecting the offer, thus relating the gross\nsurplus (the wage gap) to the costs.17\n2. The matching range: the fraction of jobs that are being accepted out of all jobs in the economy.\nThis gives us independent information about the shape of the technology \ud453(\ud465, \ud466). To see this,\nobserve that under strong complementarities, output changes fast when moving away from the\nBeckerian allocation. As a result, the output loss from non-assortative matching is large and only\na small range of matches is accepted. In contrast, under weak or no complementarities, little or\nno output is lost and for a given search cost a much larger range of matches is acceptable.\nIn order to identify the model, we need repeated observations of wages of a given worker, and\nrepeated observations of a given job. For some firms a job does not directly have an identifier in\nexisting data sets, and it might be more useful to think about jobs in the same occupation within the\nsame firm as being identical. Again, suppose for expositional purposes that we have a long panel, i.e.,\neach worker and job goes through our two-step hiring process many times so that we observe a long\nset of wages for each worker and for each job. In fact, we assume that the panel is long enough that\nwe can abstract from issues of finite samples. In this case, the average wage of a worker is his true\naverage wage. We name a worker \u201c\ud465\u201d if a fraction \ud465 of the other workers has a lower average wage and\nthe remainder a higher average wage than him. Since higher type workers in our model indeed obtain\n15Matching bands \ud434(\ud465) and \ud435(\ud466) are monotone if they form an interval whose boundaries are both either increasing or\nboth decreasing in type. As shown in the previous section, this is trivally the case when costs are constant in type. It can\nbe shown that for any \ud453 with \u2223\ud453\ud465\ud466\u2223 bounded away from zero there exists a bound \ud713 > 0 such that matching sets remain\nmonotone whenever \ud450\u2032(\ud465) < \ud713 and \ud458\u2032(\ud466) < \ud713 for \ud465, \ud466.\n16The identification method in equation (30) does not use any symmetry of either the cost or the production functions.\nSection 5 part 3 shows how monotonicity can be replaced by knowledge that costs are increasing in firm type, which\nnaturally happens under discounting. Part 10 in that section discusses how an adapted version of this approach can be\nused even in settings that do not have any natural order of firms.\n17We cannot adopt the same strategy for the firms, since we cannot rely on the \u201cprofit gap\u201d for a given job if profits\nare hard to observe. Nevertheless, we will see that bargaining reflects variation on the firms side to a degree that allows\nidentification of the firms\u2019 costs up to sign and a constant, which is sufficient to back out the loss from mismatch and the\nmagnitude of the cross-partial in production.\n17\nhigher wages on average, this recovers the true type of the worker. Then we can rank the jobs based\non the quality of their workers: We name a job \u201c\ud466\u02c6\u201d if a fraction \ud466\u02c6 of all jobs have workers of lower\nquality. Monotone matching bands imply that the distribution of workers changes in the sense of first\norder stochastic dominance, and we can measure the worker quality for example by the average of the\nworker types employed in each job over time. Under PAM higher firm types match with better firms\nand we have \ud466\u02c6 = \ud466, while under NAM higher firm types match with lower quality workers and we have\n\ud466\u02c6 = 1 \u2212 \ud466.18 For the remainder of this section, we will also indicate with a \u201chat\u201d any function that\ndeals with the transform, in which case it represents the original function under PAM, and represents\nthe function evaluated at 1\u2212 \ud466 under NAM. In particular, consider production function \ud453\u02c6(\ud465, \ud466\u02c6) which\nhas the following definition\n\ud453\u02c6(\ud465, \ud466\u02c6) =\n{\n\ud453(\ud465, \ud466\u02c6) if PAM\n\ud453(\ud465, 1\u2212 \ud466\u02c6) if NAM .\nWe know from Section (3) that we cannot identify from the wages whether PAM or NAM applies. The\nimportant point to notice is that independent of the case we are in, the cross-partial of \ud453\u02c6 recovers the\nabsolute value of the cross-partial of the original production function, i.e., we have \ud453\u02c6\ud465\ud466 = \u2223\ud453\ud465\ud466\u2223 or more\nprecisely \ud453\u02c6\ud465\ud466(\ud465, \ud466\u02c6) = \u2223\ud453\ud465\ud466(\ud465, \ud707\u22121(\ud466\u02c6))\u2223. We will see below that the absolute value of the cross-partial is\nindeed the relevant information needed to identify the loss from mismatch (together with the costs of\nwaiting).\nWe now proceed along the two steps outlined above to back out the waiting costs and this cross-\npartial. It will be convenient to start with the second step (matching range), and then return to the\nfirst step (wage gap). We conclude this section with a parametric example of how to implement this\nstrategy for our example class of production functions and discuss various measures of efficiency loss\nthat can be obtained.\nMatching Range. Assume that the costs of search have been identified from some variation in\nthe data. Then the following allows a recovery of the strengh of the cross-partial, and therefore the\nimportance of sorting. As before, with general search costs and bargaining share, the surplus will\nbe positive and results in the acceptance of a match provided that the value from the current match\noutweighs the benefit from waiting:\n\ud453(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 [\ud464\u2605(\ud465) + \ud70b\u2605(\ud466)\u2212 \ud450(\ud465)\u2212 \ud458(\ud466)] \u2265 0. (21)\nGiven our symmetry assumption, second-period wages \ud464\u2605(\ud465) and profits \ud70b\u2605(\ud466) are the same as in the\nfrictionless case.19 Rearranging and substituting the second-period wages according to (5) and profits\n18We obtain the same ranking of firms if we rank them according to the best worker they match with, the worst worker\nthey match with, or some other quantile in the distribution of workers they match with, since the distribution moves in the\ndirection of first order stochastic dominance. Alternatively, we can rank firms by the highest or the lowest wage that they\npay, both of which are increasing in type under PAM and decreasing under NAM when matching bands are monotone.\n19Similar to the previous section, the matching set \ud434(\ud466) includes all \ud465 such that equality (21) holds for (\ud465, \ud466), and\n\ud435(\ud465) includes all \ud466 such that (21) holds for (\ud465, \ud466). Symmetry ensures that under PAM \ud434(\ud465) = \ud435(\ud465), while under NAM\n\ud434(\ud465) = {1 \u2212 \ud467 : \ud467 \u2208 \ud435(1 \u2212 \ud465)}. Then assortative matching in the second period implies that \ud707(\ud465) = \ud465 under PAM and\n\ud707(\ud465) = 1\u2212 \ud465 under NAM, and wages are exactly as in the frictionless case.\n18\naccording to (6) yields equivalently\n\ud453(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212\n[\u222b \ud465\n0\n\ud453\ud465(\ud465\n\u2032, \ud707(\ud465\u2032))\ud451\ud465\u2032 +\n\u222b \ud466\n0\n\ud453\ud466(\ud707\n\u22121(\ud466\u2032), \ud466\u2032)\ud451\ud466\u2032 + \ud453(0, 0)\n]\n\u2265 \u2212[\ud450(\ud465) + \ud458(\ud466)]. (22)\nThe left hand side of this expression gives exactly the loss in terms of efficiency between matching\nnow and matching perfectly, since the term in brackets captures the social contribution that each type\nachieves under perfect matching. Recalling the definitions of \ud466\u02c6 and \ud453\u02c6 above, in the appendix we show\nthat the loss on the left hand side (22) when worker \ud465 matches with firm \ud466\u02c6 can be expressed as\n\ud43f(\ud465, \ud466\u02c6) = \u2212\n\u222b \ud465\n\ud466\u02c6\n\u222b \ud465\n\ud466\u2032\n\ud453\u02c6\ud465\ud466(\ud465\n\u2032, \ud466\u2032)\ud451\ud465\u2032\ud451\ud466\u2032. (23)\nWorkers only match when this loss is smaller than the costs of waiting: \ud43f(\ud465, \ud466\u02c6) \u2265 \u2212\n[\n\ud450(\ud465) + \ud458\u02c6(\ud466\u02c6)\n]\n. From\nthe data, we can observe the lowest identity of firm with which worker \ud465 matches. Call this identity\n\ud466(\ud465). In a long panel, it is exactly the identity where the equality is binding. Therefore, we obtain the\nidentifying equation:\n\ud43f(\ud465, \ud466(\ud465)) = \u2212\n[\n\ud450(\ud465) + \ud458\u02c6(\ud466(\ud465))\n]\n(24)\nor equivalently\n\u2212\n\u222b \ud465\n\ud466(\ud465)\n\u222b \ud465\n\ud466\u2032\n\ud453\u02c6\ud465\ud466(\ud465\n\u2032, \ud466\u2032)\ud451\ud465\u2032\ud451\ud466\u2032 = \u2212\n[\n\ud450(\ud465) + \ud458\u02c6(\ud466(\ud465))\n]\n. (25)\nSince for each worker \ud465 the lowest firm \ud466(\ud465) can be observed, given knowledge of the costs of search\nthis is a functional equation that identifies \ud453\u02c6\ud465\ud466 evaluated at (\ud465, \ud466(\ud465)), for all \ud465 \u2208 [0, 1] with \ud466(\ud465) > 0. It\nidentifies the strength of the cross-partial because it compares the noise in the matching sets (\ud465\u2212 \ud466(\ud465))\nto the noise in the wage data due to the search costs. If the wages vary substantially but matching sets\nare small, there must be a large loss in matching by slightly deviating from the optimal type, i.e., the\ncross-partial must be large.\nThe left hand side of functional equation (25) only provides information about some average level\nof the absolute value of the cross-partial accross the matching set of type \ud465 workers. We show at the\nend of this section that (25) provides enough information to back out the parameters for our familiy of\nexample production functions with simple non-linear regression techniques. For classes of production\nfunctions with more parameters, we refer the reader to equation (30) which highlights that not only\nthe average cross-partial for a given \ud465 worker but even variations of the cross-partial across different\nfirm types for that same worker type can be identified. Clearly, the cross-partial can only be identified\nat points within the matching sets, since we do not observe matches between firms and workers outside\nthe matching sets because both rather wait then match together.20 Importantly, for the application of\nthe identifying equation (25) it is crucial to obtain a notion of the search costs from the data, which\nwe consider now.\nWage Gap. We now show how the difference in wages for a given worker can be used to identify the\nwage gap. Observe that this can be achieved from first-period wages alone, which is important since\n20It is still possible to provide bounds on the cross-partial off the matching set, because it is not possible that output\nimproves extremely fast outside the matching range since in such a case agents would like to match if they meet. While\nthese bounds are relatively tight close to the actual matching set, they become fairly weak as one departs further from\nthe matching set. See Eeckhout (2007) for a related exposition on such a phenomenon.\n19\nin our stylized environment the frictionless wages really represent a notion of continuation values (see\nalso the continuous horizon extension in Section 5). Recall our notation, where every function with\n\u201chat\u201d is the original function under PAM and is the function evaluated at 1\u2212 \ud466 under NAM. Observed\nfirst-period wages for the match of worker \ud465 with firm \ud466\u02c6 are\n\ud464\u02c6(\ud465, \ud466\u02c6) = \ud6fe[\ud453\u02c6(\ud465, \ud466\u02c6)\u2212 \ud464\u2605(\ud465)\u2212 \ud70b\u02c6\u2605(\ud466\u02c6) + \ud450(\ud465) + \ud458\u02c6(\ud466\u02c6)] + \ud464\u2605(\ud465)\u2212 \ud450(\ud465), (26)\nrepresenting the outside option \ud464\u2605(\ud465)\u2212 \ud450(\ud465) plus a share \ud6fe of the surplus.\nNote that the lowest possible wage of worker \ud465 is given by his continuation value in the case where\nthe surplus is zero: \ud464(\ud465) = \ud464\u2605(\ud465) \u2212 \ud450(\ud465). Substituting this into (26) and observing that at \ud466\u02c6 = \ud465 the\nproduction is exactly \ud453\u02c6(\ud465, \ud465) = \ud464\u2605(\ud465) + \ud70b\u02c6\u2605(\ud465), we obtain\n\ud450(\ud465) + \ud458\u02c6(\ud465) =\n\ud464\u02c6(\ud465, \ud465)\u2212 \ud464(\ud465)\n\ud6fe\n, (27)\nwhere \ud464\u02c6(\ud465, \ud465) denotes the wage along the diagonal. This equation already entails most of the relevant\neconomic insights, and therefore warrants some brief comments. Assume the bargaining share is known\nor inferred through the construction that we show next, then (27) entails all relevant information for\nthe case where firm costs are constant. In such a case \ud464\u02c6(\ud465, \ud465) is simply the highest wage that the\nworker obtains, and therefore the right-hand side can be computed simply as the difference between\nthe highest and the lowest wage, divided by the bargaining share. This can be directly fed into the\nright hand side of equation (25), which then allows identification of the cross-partial. Therefore, the\ncombination of (25) and (27) are at the heart of the identification strategy, and capture the intuitive\nideas described in the beginning of this section.\nThe final arguments provide technical details that establish that the variation in the data is in\nprinciple rich enough to uniquely back out the bargaining share, and to account for the fact that (27)\ngives firm costs that are evaluated at \ud465 while the right hand side of (25) needs the firm\u2019s cost evaluated\nat the lower bound \ud466(\ud465). Clearly, when matching sets are small the difference between \ud465 and \ud466(\ud465) is\ninsubstantial.\nTo see that there is only a unique bargaining share consistent with the wage data, observe that\ngiven the assumption of a long enough panel we identify the type \ud465 of the worker and the type \ud466 of the\nfirm correctly except for the ordering. Enough observations then allow a precise inference on the wage\n\ud464\u02c6(\ud465, \ud466) at the points in the matching set. This means that changes in the wages as matches change\ncan be backed out from the observed wage data. In particular, the wage changes \ud464\u02c6\ud465(\ud465, \ud465) and \ud464\u02c6\ud466(\ud465, \ud465)\nwhen one moves away from the diagonal in the direction of better workers or firms can be inferred.\nFrom (5) and (6) we know that \ud464\u02c6\u2605\ud465(\ud465) = \ud453\u02c6\ud465(\ud465, \ud465) and \ud70b\u02c6\n\u2605\n\ud466(\ud466\u02c6) = \ud453\u02c6\ud466(\ud466\u02c6, \ud466\u02c6), and therefore we obtain from\ndifferentiating (26) that\n\ud464\u02c6\ud465(\ud465, \ud465) = \u2212(1\u2212 \ud6fe)\ud450\u2032(\ud465) and \ud464\u02c6\ud466(\ud465, \ud465) = \ud6fe\ud458\u02c6\u2032(\ud465). (28)\nUsing these relationships allows us to simplify the following difference between the value of (27) for\nworker types \ud465 and \ud465\u2032 :\n\ud464\u02c6(\ud465, \ud465)\u2212 \ud464(\ud465)\u2212 [\ud464\u02c6(\ud465\u2032, \ud465\u2032)\u2212 \ud464(\ud465\u2032)]\n\ud6fe\n= \ud450(\ud465) + \ud458\u02c6(\ud465)\u2212 \ud450(\ud465\u2032)\u2212 \ud458\u02c6(\ud465\u2032)\n\u21d4 \ud464\u02c6(\ud465, \ud465)\u2212 \ud464(\ud465)\u2212 [\ud464\u02c6(\ud465\n\u2032, \ud465\u2032)\u2212 \ud464(\ud465\u2032)]\n\ud6fe\n= \u2212 1\n1\u2212 \ud6fe\n\u222b \ud465\n\ud465\u2032\n\ud464\u02c6\ud465(\ud465\u02dc, \ud465\u02dc)\ud451\ud465\u02dc+\n1\n\ud6fe\n\u222b \ud465\n\ud465\u2032\n\ud464\u02c6\ud466(\ud466\u02dc, \ud466\u02dc)\ud451\ud466\u02dc. (29)\n20\nThis enables the identification of \ud6fe since all wage terms in (29) can be inferred from the data, and only\na unique value of gamma solves this equation.\nTo be able to use (25), we need to recover \ud450(\ud465) + \ud458\u02c6(\ud466(\ud465)). While for small matching bands it holds\nthat \ud466(\ud465) \u2248 \ud465 and we can safely use \ud450(\ud465) + \ud458(\ud465) as identified by (27), adjustments for larger matching\nbands might be non-trivial. Building on (27) and on (28) yields the following equations that identify\nthe right hand side of (25) exactly from the observable wages and the already identified bargaining\npower:\n\ud450(\ud465) + \ud458\u02c6(\ud466(\ud465)) = \ud450(\ud465) + \ud458\u02c6(\ud465)\u2212 [\ud458\u02c6(\ud465)\u2212 \ud458\u02c6(\ud466(\ud465))]\n= \u2212 \ud464\u02c6(\ud465, \ud465)\u2212 \ud464(\ud465)\n\ud6fe\n\u2212\n\u222b \ud465\n\ud466(\ud465)\n\ud458\u02c6\ud466(\ud466)\ud451\ud466\n= \u2212\n\ud464\u02c6(\ud465, \ud465)\u2212 \ud464(\ud465)\u2212 \u222b \ud465\ud466(\ud465) \ud464\u02c6\ud466(\ud466, \ud466)\ud451\ud466\n\ud6fe\n.\nAs mentioned before, if either the variation in firm costs is small (\ud458\u2032 small means that \ud464\u02c6\ud466(\ud466, \ud466) is small)\nor if the matching bands are narrow and therefore \ud466(\ud465) \u2248 \ud465, then the third term in the numerator\nbecomes negligible. In such cases the search costs can effectively be obtained by taking the difference\nbetween the maximum and the minimum wage that workers obtain without any further adjustment, as\noutlined in the discussion of (27).\nThe Parametric Example. To highlight the applicability of this identification strategy, we focus on\nthe parametric family of production functions that we outlined as examples in (1) and (2), and consider\nthe original case of constant and common search costs \ud450(\ud465) = \ud458(\ud466) = \ud450 and equal bargaining weights\n\ud6fe = 1\/2. Under our leading examples \ud453+ and \ud453\u2212 the loss due to mis-coordination in absolute terms is\ngiven by\n\u2223\ud43f(\ud465, \ud466)\u2223 = \u2223\ud6fc\u2223\n2\n(\ud465\ud703 \u2212 \ud466\ud703)2.\nBy (25) we can identify the strength of sorting via equation\n\u2223\ud6fc\u2223(\ud465\ud703 \u2212 \ud466(\ud465)\ud703)2 = 4\ud450\nor equivalently\n\ud465 =\n(\n2 (\ud450\/\u2223\ud6fc\u2223)1\/2 \u2212 \ud466(\ud465)\ud703\n)1\/\ud703\nas long as \ud466(\ud465) > 0. The parameters \u2223\ud6fc\u2223 and \ud703 in this functional form can be identified by the joint\nbehavior of \ud465 and \ud466(\ud465). Simple non-linear regression techniques can assess these parameters. Knowing\nthese parameters, it is easy to compute various statistics regarding the aggregate loss from mismatch.\nThe simplest one is the dollar amount of lost output when agents match completely randomly relative\nto perfect matching (keeping search costs constant), which is simply:\n\ud4a2 =\n\u222b 1\n0\n\u222b 1\n0\n\u2223\ud43f(\ud465, \ud466)\u2223\ud451\ud465\ud451\ud466\n=\n\u2223\ud6fc\u2223\n2\n\u222b 1\n0\n\u222b 1\n0\n(\ud465\ud703 \u2212 \ud466\ud703)2\ud451\ud465\ud451\ud466 = \u2223\ud6fc\u2223 \ud703\n2\n(2\ud703 + 1)(\ud703 + 1)2\n.\n21\nPossibly more meaningful might be the loss from equilibrium play (including costs) relative to costless\nperfect matching, which is\n\u222b 1\n0\n\u222b 1\n0 min{\u2223\ud43f(\ud465, \ud466)\u2223, 2\ud450}\ud451\ud465\ud451\ud466 since losses larger than \ud450 are capped by the\nsearch costs. Finally, one can ask about the output loss from completely random matching without\ncosts relative to equilibrium play including the search costs, which is the difference between the two\nprevious computations: \ud4a2 \u2212 \u222b 10 \u222b 10 min{\u2223\ud43f(\ud465, \ud466)\u2223, 2\ud450}\ud451\ud465\ud451\ud466 = \u222b 10 \u222b 10 min{\u2223\ud43f(\ud465, \ud466)\u2223 \u2212 2\ud450, 0}\ud451\ud465\ud451\ud466.\nGiven \ud6fc and \ud703, we know exactly the cross-partial \ud453\ud465\ud466 for all pairs \ud465, \ud466. This clearly depends on the\nnormalization of the distribution functions (to uniform distributions) and the associated normalization\nof the technology \ud453 , but the dollar loss due to mismatch is invariant to the normalization. We can\ntherefore obtain an indication of the efficiency loss of mismatch relative to the total wages for example.\n5 Discussion\nOur analysis of Becker\u2019s (1973) matching framework is rather specific. In this section we discuss\nquestions of robustness and relate our results to other contributions in the literature.\n1. Alternative Identification Strategies. First, we consider alternative strategies of identification,\nand relate our approach to work by Gautier and Teulings (2004, 2006). They assess the loss from\nmismatch in a sorting model. Their model is similar in spirit, but different along several substantial\ndimensions. They make assumptions on the output functions (log-supermodularity) that guarantee\npositive assortative matching from the outset, while we remain agnostic about the direction of sorting.\nAdditionally, they assume that the output is sold in a final goods market, and therefore the price is\nendogenous, yielding a model of comparative advantage where all firms make equal profits. In contrast,\nour model is one of absolute advantage where more productive firms make more profits \u2013 but see the\ndiscussion on entry below. They use a second order Taylor expansion around the frictionless benchmark,\nwhich generates a local concept to back out the cross-partial. This generates in Gautier and Teulings\n(2006) a constant cross-partial along the entire matching range, while in our specification the cross-\npartial is allowed to vary. On the other hand they are careful in specifying measurement error and\nshort panels, from which we have abstracted.\nDespite the differences it is possible to investigate how the main ingredient in their approach fares\nin our environment. In particular, we can show in which environment there is a natural counterpart\nto their approach, and provide an extension for environments that go beyond their analysis. In the\nfollowing we consider three identification strategies (A) \u2013 (C) that we depict in Figure 4 and discuss in\nturn. In all of these approaches our exposition does not rely on knowing the sign of the cross-partial,\nand we ask whether we can back out its absolute value regardless.\nThe main identification strategy in Section 4 relies on measuring the width of the matching bands.\nFor a given search cost (which has to be backed out from the data), small matching bands is synonymous\nto rejecting a large fraction of firms, which only happens if it is important to match with the right firm.\nIn Figure 4 we illustrate this approach as a measure of the distance between the matching bands, labeled\n(A).\nAn alternative approach arises from the observation that wage changes contain information about\nthe local cross-partial. In particular, given the definition of the wages in (26), the cross-partial\n\ud464\u02c6\ud465\ud466(\ud465, \ud466\u02c6) = \ud6fe\ud453\u02c6\ud465\ud466(\ud465, \ud466\u02c6). (30)\n22\nxy\n10\n1\nA\nB\nC\nD\nFigure 4: Identification strategies to determine the absolute value of the cross-partial: A. Global\napproach measuring size of and change in matching bounds; B. Local analysis of taking cross-differences\nof two adjacent points as in (29); C. Obtain curvature of wages along the y-axis locally around the 45-\ndegree line.\nTherefore, whenever we observe wages for (\ud465, \ud466\u02c6) and (\ud465\u2032, \ud466\u02c6\u2032) with \ud465 \u2215= \ud465\u2032 and \ud466\u02c6 \u2215= \ud466\u02c6\u2032 and these tuples\nare close to each other, then the double difference in the wages \ud464\u02c6(\ud465\u2032, \ud466\u02c6\u2032)\u2212 \ud464\u02c6(\ud465, \ud466\u02c6\u2032)\u2212 (\ud464\u02c6(\ud465\u2032, \ud466\u02c6)\u2212 \ud464\u02c6(\ud465, \ud466\u02c6))\ndivided by [\ud465\u2032\u2212\ud465][\ud466\u02c6\u2032\u2212\ud466\u02c6] yields an approximation for the cross-partial locally. This allows approximately\nthe identification of the cross-partial at any point in the matching range as long as enough wage\nobservations close by are available. This identification strategy does also not rely on any symmetry\nassumption regarding the costs of search or the match value function that was made in previous sections\nto simplify the characterization of second period wages, since the profits and wages at the second stage\ndrop out here by taking cross-partials. We illustrate this approach in Figure 4 by the arrow labeled\n(B), which considers the wage change between two points (\ud465, \ud466) and (\ud465\u2032, \ud466\u2032). Clearly, this approach only\napplies when the arrow in (B) is neither horizontal nor vertical, as in those cases one would divide by\nzero.\nGautier and Teulings (2004, 2006) exploit this idea further, and find a way to use the wage variation\nin the vertical direction to back out the cross-partial. In the frictionless model, worker \ud465 chooses his\noptimal firm \ud707(\ud465) such that \ud464\ud466(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)) = 0. The full derivative with respect to \ud465 along the equilibrium\npath gives a tight connection between the concavity of the wages and the cross-partial of the wages,\nand the latter is informative about the cross-partial in production according to (30). In particular,\n\ud464\ud466\ud466(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465)) = \u2212\ud464\ud465\ud466(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465))\/\ud707\u2032(\ud465). Even in the model with search frictions and without knowledge of\nthe direction of sorting, it is easy to show that concavity of the wage in (26) yields similarly\n\ud464\u02c6\ud466\ud466(\ud465, \ud465) = \ud464\u02c6\ud465\ud466(\ud465, \ud465) = \ud6fe\ud453\u02c6\ud465\ud466(\ud465, \ud465), (31)\nprovided the firms\u2019 search costs are constant. That means that around the diagonal in Figure 4 we\ncan measure the cross-partial by looking at the local curvature in wages for a given \ud465 when the firm\n23\ntype changes, depicted by arrow (C). This approach effectively relates to Figure 3. As search costs\nbecome small, the width of this figure becomes small and in the limit only contains firm types close to\nthe optimal match for which (31) is approximately valid. In the limit, the relation of width to height\nof that figure determine the curvature \ud464\u02c6\ud466\ud466 and identifies the cross-partial (Gautier and Teulings 2004).\nThis approach resembles approach (A), but uses the limit when search costs are small and matches only\noccur in the proximity of the optimal match. Alternatively, Gautier and Teulings (2006) show that the\ncurvature of a worker\u2019s wage when the firm type changes can be directly captured in standard wage\nregressions by including a quadratic firm effect. This generates a ingenious way of capturing sorting in\na standard econometric specification, and the coefficient directly reflects the cross-partial. Our results\nsuggest that this holds even in the absence of restrictions on the sign of sorting.\nThe latter approach becomes problematic, though, when the firms\u2019 search costs are non-constant,\nand in particular non-linear. Undertaking the same exercise of twice differentiating (26) reveals that in\ngeneral\n\ud464\u02c6\ud466\ud466(\ud465, \ud465) = \ud6fe\n[\n\ud453\u02c6\ud465\ud466(\ud465, \ud465) + \ud458\u02c6\n\u2032\u2032(\ud465)\n]\n, (32)\nand therefore the curvature in a worker\u2019s wage due to changing firm type does not directly recover the\ncross-partial. Non-zero second derivatives of the cost function arise for example under discounting with\nfactor \ud6fd, for which the loss of the firm is \ud458\u02c6(\ud466) = (1 \u2212 \ud6fd)\ud70b\u02c6\u2605(\ud466\u02c6), which is quadratic when the output\nis multiplicative between the two matched types. Whether the second effect is large depends on the\nnature of the costs \u2013 in Gautier and Teulings (2006) this does not arise as costs are assumed to be\ntype-independent (see their Assumption A1).\nTo address the possibility of type-dependent costs, one can use the adjustments we proposed in the\nprevious section. Alternatively, we can directly exploit the cross-partial of the wages (30).\n2. Infinite Horizon. The stylized nature of our two-period model was called for to be able to derive\nthe results analytically. For estimation purposes, one would obviously choose to use an infinite horizon\nmodel as is standard in the search literature. We therefore propose the simplest model with constant\nsearch costs inspired by Atakan (2006). Time is discrete, agents are infinitely lived, and unmatched\nagents meet a potential partner every period. Matched partners disappear from the market until\nthere is exogenous breakup of the match, at which point they return to the market. For expositional\nsimplicity, consider symmetry in the distribution of types \ud465 and \ud466 and a positive cross-partial. Denote\nthe stationary distribution of unmatched types by \ud43a(\u22c5). In each period, the output produced between a\nmatched pair (\ud465, \ud466) is given by \ud453(\ud465, \ud466), where \ud453 is symmetric: \ud453(\ud465, \ud466) = \ud453(\ud466, \ud465). If a match is rejected,\nthe payoff is equal to \u2212\ud450. Denote by \ud463(\ud465), \ud463(\ud466) the value functions of a type \ud465 and \ud466, which are identical\nbecause of symmetry. The value function \ud463(\ud465) for a type \ud465 is given by the wage if the job is accepted\nand the value of continued search in case it is rejected:\n\ud463(\ud465) =\n\u222b\n\u2133(\ud465)\n\ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\ud451\ud43a(\ud466) +\n\u222b\n\ud466\/\u2208\u2133(\ud465)\n\ud451\ud43a(\ud466)[\ud463(\ud465)\u2212 \ud450] (33)\nwhere \ud464(\ud465, \ud466) is the expected wage paid over the duration of the match and \u2133(\ud465) is the matching set\n24\nfor type \ud465.21 Due to symmetry the value function is identical for firm \ud466.22\nThen the surplus of any match can be written as: \ud460(\ud465, \ud466) = \ud453(\ud465, \ud466) \u2212 [\ud463(\ud465) + \ud463(\ud466)\u2212 2\ud450] . Matches\nstay together as long as surplus is positive, and the lowest firm type that a worker matches with is\ncharacterized by \ud453(\ud465, \ud466(\ud465))\u2212 \ud463(\ud465)\u2212 \ud463(\ud466(\ud465)) = \u22122\ud450. This resembles the same trade-off between current\nmatch and continuation value that we had in our two-period model. The loss is now the loss relative to\noptimal search, which for small costs converges to the loss in the two-period model (for the convergence\nresult, see Atakan 2006). We assume that the surplus is split equally, so the wage is equal to the outside\noption \ud463(\ud465) plus half the surplus minus the cost of search:\n\ud464(\ud465, \ud466) =\n\ud460(\ud465, \ud466)\n2\n+ \ud463(\ud465)\u2212 \ud450\n=\n1\n2\n[\ud453(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \ud463(\ud465)\u2212 \ud463(\ud466) + 2\ud450] + \ud463(\ud465)\u2212 \ud450. (34)\nThis formulation of the wages allows us to generalize the most important points of our model: First,\na fixed effects model is again misspecified because the wages at the lowest and highest firm in the\nmatching set are equal the continuation value \ud463(\ud465) \u2212 \ud450, and are higher in the middle, leading to a\nnon-monotone pattern. Second, it is not hard to show that the sign of the cross-partial is still not\nidentified, but the absolute value of the cross-partial can still be identified, for example through (30).\nAlternatively, the loss function between actual and optimal matching can be backed out by (24) where\nthe loss represents the difference between output and optimal continuation, which converges to (23)\nfor small search costs. Third, the opportunity cost of search \ud450 can also be recovered in a similar way\nas before, with slight adjustment: Let \ud70b(\ud465) =Prob{\u2133} = \u222b \ud462(\ud465)\ud459(\ud465) \ud451\ud43a(\ud466) be the observed probability of\nforming a match for worker \ud465 when unemployed, let \ud53c\ud464(\ud465) be his average wage and let \ud464(\ud465) be the\nlowest wage accepted. Since the lowest wage is equal to the continuation value: \ud464(\ud465) = \ud463(\ud465) \u2212 \ud450, we\ncan substitute this into (33) and obtain the continuation value as the weighted average of expected and\nminimum wage \ud463(\ud465) = \ud70b\ud53c\ud464(\ud465) + (1\u2212 \ud70b)\ud464(\ud465). Substituting this back into the minimum wage equation\nwe obtain\n\ud450 = [\ud53c\ud464(\ud465)\u2212 \ud464]\ud70b.\nObserve that the cost is calculated in the same way as before, except that due to random matching,\nnow we use the average wage instead of the maximum wage, and we need to take into account the\nmatching probability. This is quite intuitive since under random matching, the new matched wage is\nan average rather than the maximum and in addition, with random matching frictions next period\u2019s\nmatch is not necessarily accepted.\n3. Special Cases of Type-dependent Costs: Discounting and Type-dependent Arrival\nRates. Discounting is a common assumption in many models of labor search. Here we briefly outline\nthat discounting is a special case of type-dependent search costs. Similarly, type-dependent arrival rates\n21Note that we do not need to include the continuation value after the match breaks up exogenously because of the\none-shot deviation principle, which requires optimal decisions this period and takes optimal decisions in the future as\ngiven, so that these continuation values after breakup constitute constants in the problem that can be neglected for the\npurpose of optimal acceptance decisions.\n22The value function \ud463(\ud466) for a firm is given by \ud463(\ud466) =\n\u222b\n\u2133(\ud466)[\ud453(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \ud464(\ud465, \ud466)]\ud451\ud43a(\ud465) +\n\u222b\n\ud465\/\u2208\u2133(\ud466) \ud451\ud43a(\ud465)[\ud463(\ud466)\u2212 \ud450]. Given\nan equal split of the surplus and symmetry, the value functions are identical to that of the workers.\n25\nof offers also constitutes a special form of type-dependent search costs. Given this insight, it is clear\nthat the identification strategies in Section 4 and at the beginning of this section can be applied to\nrecover the strength of sorting. Also, we briefly outline that the problems when using the correlation\nof fixed effects carry over to such environments. We will start by exploring the properties of discouting\nbecause of its prominence in economic modelling, and then briefly return to type-dependent arrival\nrates.\nIn Section 2 we initially analyzed a Beckerian model with a fixed search cost, the infinite horizon\nversion of which is analyzed by Atakan (2006). One direct result was that wages are non-monotonic in\nthe type of the firm and, therefore, do not fulfill the assumptions of a fixed-effect estimator. In most\nsearch models, the cost of waiting is modeled by means of discounting as in Shimer and Smith (2000).\nWe therefore now assume time discounting with factor \ud6fd \u2208 (0, 1). In this case the costs of search are\nthe delay costs in obtaining the second-period match: \ud450(\ud465) = (1\u2212 \ud6fd)\ud464\u2605(\ud465), \ud458(\ud466) = (1\u2212 \ud6fd)\ud70b\u2605(\ud466), where\n\ud6fd is the discount factor. Waiting costs are now type-dependent as the loss is proportional to the outside\noption: higher types pay a higher cost from delay. This is a specific case of the general setting with\ntype-dependent costs.\nWhen the matching sets are monotone, then our previous analysis applies and identification of the\nmagnitude of sorting can be achieved. Under monotone matching bands we obtain an order on the firms\nthat reflects their willingness to hire better workers. Monotone matching bands imply improvments\nin the distribution of matches of the firms in the sense of first order stochastic dominance and we\nget a consistent order, whether we order firms by the average type of the worker they employ, the\nminimum type or the maximum type. Shimer and Smith (2000) point out that matching bands may\nnot be monotone under discounting, though, unless the production function is sufficiently supermodular.\nOtherwise matching bands may be decreasing in some range even if the match value is supermodular.\nTherefore, it is worthwile to point out that identification can be achieved even when matching bands\nare non-monotone, as long as we know that \ud458(\ud466) is increasing as is the case under discouting.\nWe can then recover the order of \ud466\u02c6 correctly (i.e., \ud466\u02c6 = \ud466 under PAM and \ud466\u02c6 = 1 \u2212 \ud466 under NAM)\neven when matching sets are not increasing. The reason is that under PAM the upper bound of the\nmatching set is always increasing, while under NAM the lower bound is always decreasing. To see this,\nconsider some firm type \ud466 and the highest worker type \ud465 > \ud466 for which (22) holds. A slightly higher\nfirm is then also willing to match with \ud465 because the right hand side of (22) decreases in firm type when\ncosts are increasing, and under PAM the left hand side increases since the efficiency loss gets smaller\nas the distance between \ud465 and \ud466 shrinks. As a result, the upper bound of the matching sets are strictly\nincreasing. Under NAM consider the lowest bound of a given \ud466 where \ud465 < \ud466 and such that (22) holds.\nA type above \ud466 would also match with \ud465 since the right hand side of (22) has again decreased and under\nNAM the increase in the distance between worker \ud465 and the firm reduces the loss from mismatch. This\nmeans that the lower bound is increasing in \ud466 in the case of NAM.\nTherefore, as long as we restrict ourselves to production functions that are either NAM or PAM, we\ncan proceed as follows. First, order the firms according to the best worker they are matched with. If the\nmatching was PAM, this recovers the firm type correctly given a long enough panel at least for those\nfirms with interior matching sets. If the matching was NAM and matching sets are not increasing, then\nthe non-monotonicity will imply that some firms of different type will get the same\u201cidentity\u201d (because\n26\nthey have the same upper bound) and since the lower bounds of the matching sets are increasing (in\n\ud466\u02c6) these firms have very different matching sets. When this is detected in the data, matching cannot\nhave been PAM, and so the firms can be ordered according the lowest worker they match with, which\nis increasing in \ud466\u02c6. Therefore, we can recover the order on the firms at least for those firms with interior\nmatching sets, and the rest of the analysis proceeds as before. Clearly, if matching bands are monotone,\nthis procedure does not help to distinguish PAM and NAM since ordering by either the best workers\nor the worst workers gives the same ranking and no inconsistencies.\nWhile the magnitude of sorting can be recovered, we briefly highlight that similar problems arise\nfor the use of fixed effects as we discussed in Section 3.2 for constant search costs. To show that similar\ncaveats apply, we again focus on a simplified version of our production function \ud453+(\ud465, \ud466) = \ud465\ud466. When\ndiscounting replaces fixed waiting costs, a match between \ud465 and \ud466 will be formed provided the surplus\nexceeds the cost of delay: \ud453(\ud465, \ud466) \u2212 \ud6fd\ud4652\/2 \u2212 \ud6fd\ud4662\/2 > 0. The matching set then is \ud434(\ud466) = [\ud43e\ud466,\ud43e\ud466]\nwhere \ud43e = \ud6fd\u22121\n(\n1\u2212\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \ud6fd2\n)\nand \ud43e\u00af = \ud6fd\u22121\n(\n1 +\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \ud6fd2\n)\n, and is monotone in type. The worker\u2019s\nwage in a match (\ud465, \ud466) in the first period is given by \ud464(\ud465, \ud466) with derivative \u2202\ud464\/\u2202\ud466:\n\ud464(\ud465, \ud466) =\n1\n2\n\ud465\ud466 + \ud6fd\n\ud4652\n4\n\u2212 \ud6fd \ud466\n2\n4\nand\n\u2202\ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\n\u2202\ud466\n=\n\ud465\n2\n\u2212 \ud6fd \ud466\n2\n(35)\nThe wage is hump-shaped. The derivative is negative when \ud465 < \ud6fd\ud466. Therefore, the wage is decreasing\nfor all worker types in [\ud43e\ud466, \ud6fd\ud466]. This set is non-empty for any discount factor.23 While in this setting\nidentification of the sign of the cross-partial might be possible, the difference between wages of positive\nand negative assorted production functions is of order (1\u2212\ud6fd) and therefore hard to detect when agents\nare patient.24\nFigure 5.a. illustrates the matching pattern. The matching sets are no longer constant as before. In\ngeneral, they will also be non-linear (for example when output is \ud465\ud703\ud466\ud703, with \ud703 \u2215= 1). Figure 5.b. exhibits\nthe wage pattern as a function of the distance \ud458 between the worker and the firm. The wages at the\nboundaries reflect the value from waiting and therefore necessarily are the same. The wage schedule\nis single-peaked, only that the peak is shifted to higher wages compared to the previous section. Still\nroughly for half of the acceptance set the wage is decreasing in \ud466 and falls to the value of waiting at\nthe boundary. As we illustrated above for the case of constant search costs, going to an infinite horizon\nmodel even with discounting does not change the analysis much.\nFinally, we briefly outline that discouting can be augmented by type-dependent arrival rates and still\nbe captured as a special case of type-dependent costs. One can imagine that different types of agents\nhave access to trading partners at different rates. Maybe more skilled workers are better connected and\n23It is straightforward to show that \ud43e = \ud6fd\u22121\n(\n1\u2212\u221a1\u2212 \ud6fd2) \ud466 < \ud6fd\ud466 if and only if 1\u2212 \ud6fd2 > (1\u2212 \ud6fd2)2, which is true for\nall \ud6fd \u2208 (0, 1).\n24Under the submodular specification \ud453\u2212(\ud465, \ud466) = (1 \u2212 \ud466)\ud465 + \ud466 the wage will be as in (35) when we replace \ud466 by its\ntransform \ud466\u02c6 = 1 \u2212 \ud466, plus an added term 1\n2\n(1 \u2212 \ud6fd)(1 \u2212 \ud466\u02c6). This simple example shows that identification of the sign\nwill be difficult in praxis because the difference in wages between PAM and NAM becomes neglegible when \ud6fd is close\nto one. In fact, one can prove that identification of the sign is impossible without restrictions on the cost functions. If\nthe costs themselves have to be identified and there are no further restrictions on these costs, it is easy to generalize the\nnon-identification result in Proposition 3 to the heterogeneous cost setting in Section 4. Since discounting implies the\nrestriction that costs are increasing in type, this non-identification result does not readily apply to this setting, though.\n27\nxy\nK\u03b2\n10\n1\nK\u03b2\nFigure 5: a. The acceptance sets under discounting. b. First period wages for under mismatch with a\ntype that is \ud458 away from the optimal match. [Parameter values: \ud465 = .5, \ud6fd = .98]\ntherefore more easily find a partner. As it happens, the general case of type-dependent arrival rates is\nisomorphic to the case of type-dependent search costs that we analyzed in Section 4. This captures the\nnotion that different types may have more difficulty in finding a job, for example it may be harder to\nfind a job for a high-skilled CEO than a low-skilled assembly line worker. To see that this is equivalent\nto the case of general search costs, observe that we can model arrival rates via a probability \ud6fc(\ud465) of\nentering the second period of our model. Then the condition is\n\ud453(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 (\ud6fc(\ud465)\ud6fd\ud464\u2605(\ud465) + \ud6fc(\ud466)\ud6fd\ud70b\u2605(\ud466)) \u2265 0,\nwhere as before, the equivalent cost function is \ud450(\ud465) = (1\u2212 \ud6fc(\ud465)\ud6fd)\ud464\u2605(\ud465).\n4. Entry. The model can easily be accommodated to allow for entry of firms at a type-dependent\nentry cost (see e.g., Shi (2001)). Assume that machines of quality \ud466 cost \ud705(\ud466). Clearly, as long as \ud705(\ud466)\nis identical to the expected profits of a firm of type \ud466 the firms are willing to enter exactly in the\namounts needed to justify the distributions that we assumed in the equilibrium analysis. A sufficient\ncondition for this to be feasible is that \ud453(0, 0)\u2212\ud4640 > \ud450 and \ud4640 > \ud450, in which case the expected payoffs\nfor all firms and workers outweigh the costs of search and the additional element of initial entry costs\nleads to zero profits for all firms. Obviously, it is important that more productive machines are more\nexpensive, otherwise all firms would acquire the same machines and the firm-type-distribution would\nbe degenerate. While also the reverse result that any strictly increasing entry cost schedule leads to an\nequilibrium can be formally proven, we omit the formal exposition for brevity.25\n25The formal analysis does reveal some interesting points regarding differentiability. Note that a finite number of points\nwhere \ud453 is non-differentiable do not change our analysis in the main body. With entry, it is not difficult to show that if\n\ud705(\ud466) and \ud453 are differentiable then the resulting type distribution will be continuous and differentiable in the frictionless\ncase and continuous and almost everywhere differentiable in the case with search frictions. The non-differentiability may\n28\n5. Comparison with Repeated Static Matching. Consider the static wage determination model\nproposed by Abowd, Kramarz, Lengermann, and Perez-Duarte (2004): In each match between a pair\n(\ud465, \ud466) the total output is divided according to a sharing rule \ud6fd in which the worker obtains \ud6fd\ud453(\ud465, \ud466).\nIn this specification the wage is monotonically increasing in \ud466. When this is repeated, a high \ud465 worker\nwho is matched with a low \ud466 job may choose, at a cost, to take a new draw. This will lead to some\nsorting since those who are most mismatched are most willing to take a new draw. Observe here that\ndeviations are unilateral: a worker who is matched with a high \ud466 does not choose to separate, but it is\nthe high \ud466 firm that chooses to take a new draw. As a result, inefficient separations occur as the worker\nis not permitted to compensate the separating firm for continuing the match. The worker would be\nwilling to accept a lower wage in order to continue the match. This lower wage would eventually lead\nto the non-monotonicity that we see in our setting.\nThe important aspect is that wages are independent of outside options (assumed to be zero), which\nmakes this model essentially static. Most labor market models do not have this feature. Rather, when\ndeciding whether to stay together or to split up, the bargaining is usually about the surplus that the\npair enjoys over and above the value that each partner can ensure himself by separating. When a firm\nhas a high value from separating, then it first gets compensated for its high outside option and only\nthe remaining value gets split. In such a formulation if a firm is nearly indifferent between searching\nfor a more appropriate worker or staying with the current worker, then it is only willing to give very\nlittle additional wage to the worker (above and beyond his compensation for not searching further). In\ncontrast, in the repeated static matching approach, such a firm would simply search for a new worker\nbecause the share it has to give to the current worker is too large (it separates even though staying\nmatched would be socially efficient), because the wage does not reflect the continuation payoffs.\n6. Directed Search. In the directed search model of Shimer (2005) with ex post screening, com-\nplementarities lead to sorting. The firms\u2019 offer strategies are monotonic, in the sense that a higher\nworker type obtains higher wages from better firms. Interestingly, in that model a non-monotonicity\nmay appear on the worker side, since a higher worker type may obtain a lower wage at a given firm\n(being compensated by a much higher probability of getting hired). Alternatively, if workers were to\nauction off their labor, then the equilibrium wages offered would be again non-linear in firm type.26\n7. On-the-job Search. On-the-Job-Search (OJS) is another likely candidate for identifying sorting\nusing equilibrium mismatch. Bagger and Lentz (2008), Lise, Meghir and Robin (2008) and Lopes de\nMelo (2008) consider a sorting model with on-the-job search (as in Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002)\nand Cahuc, Postel-Vinay and Robin (2006)). As long as a job is scarce, matched pairs face a trade-\narise at the points where the matching sets reach the boundaries of the type space. When we re-normalize \ud453 to be able to\nwork with a uniform type distribution, the normalized \ud453 retains monotonicity and continuity everywhere but may inherit\npoints of non-differentiability. Since it remains almost everywhere differentiable, we can carry out our analysis as in the\nmain body, only that the assignment function may have discontinuities in its slope at the points where normalized \ud453 is\ndiscontinuous.\n26We are grateful to Robert Shimer for pointing this out to us. Eeckhout and Kircher (2010) show a related result of\ndecreasing wages for better workers when directed search is introduced into the standard Becker (1973) model without\nex-post screening, but in this case the result is restricted to the case of NAM.\n29\noff between matching early and waiting for the appropriate types.27 This arises because in nearly all\nexisting models a current match allows only the workers to search further but precludes the firms from\nfurther matches, and thus introduces an opportunity cost for inappropriate matches. Even if both sides\ncan search such an opportunity cost remains present as long as arrival rates in a match are lower than\nfor unmatched agents. In such cases on-the-job search will affect the exact nature of the equilibrium\nwages, but high type firms will still only pay relatively low wages to low type workers to compensate\nthem for their lost continuation value without that worker. Nevertheless, the exact incorporation of on-\nthe-job search into our environment requires further research beccause it requires a different assessment\nof the opportunity costs of search that go beyond the analysis presented here.\n8. Use of Additional Data: The Attribution Problem. Our setup does not exploit any other\ndata except for wages, matched partners, and possibly search duration. Existing data sets feature much\nricher data, both on observables of the workers and the firms. We note here the benefits and problems\nin using such data. First, for the workers the additional data obviously provides an additional source\nto identify the type of the worker. Nevertheless, when the data on wages for each worker is rich enough\nthis is not strictly necessary, since the wages alone allow us to identifying the type of the worker.\nWhile in applications the additional data through observables reduces noise through finite samples and\nmeasurement error, for identification in long panels it is not strictly necessary.\nSecond, observables about firm profit or output would indeed provide additional information that\ngoes beyond those contained in wage data. If such data on a job by job level is available, it would allow\nus not only to identify the strength but also the sign of sorting. And while there are good data on firm\nprofits, the problem is that there are no data on job profits. In multi-worker firms, we need to attribute\nthe share of each worker\u2019s contribution to the overall firm profits. Even in the simplest economy we\nneed to decide what the contribution of very different occupations (CEO, accountant, and secretary)\nis to the firm profit. Since this decomposition seems difficult across occupations28, we propose to focus\non the economically important and manageable problem of identifying the strength of sorting.\nBeing aware of the shortcomings of the wage data in fixed effects estimates, some contributions have\nused output data to assess the direction of sorting, as mentioned in the introduction. For example,\nMendes, van den Berg, and Lindeboom (2007) use productivity data instead of wage data. They choose\naverage firm-specific productivity to attribute output from the firm to an individual worker. They find\nthat average firm-specific productivity and worker skill exhibit strong positive sorting.\n9. Measurement Error and Wage Profiles. Following most of the literature on identification,\nour insights are based on the assumption of large panels. In such a setting measurement error does\nnot affect indicators such as average wages. Nevertheless, it will inflate statistics such as the maximum\nand deflate statistics such as the minimum wage used \ud464. Therefore, it might be more prudent to use\nmore conservative statistics such as the 95% interval of wages for a given type of agent. The alternative\n27In Bagger and Lentz (2008) jobs are not scarce since firms can open as many jobs as they want. The sorting effect in\ntheir model derives from differences in the intensity with which workers search for a new job.\n28In a simple matching model of the firm, Eeckhout and Pinheiro (2008) show that only under very specific conditions,\nnamely homotheticity in the production technology, wage ratios of different skills within a firm will be the same as those\nacross firms. In all other cases, the wage share of a given skill is different in different firms, and as a result simply\nattributing profits to jobs proportional to wages will be biased.\n30\nidentification procedure outlined in (30) can be applied with sufficiently many data observations if we\nuse the average wage in a very small neighborhood of (\ud465, \ud466\u02c6) and the average wage in a very small neigh-\nborhood of (\ud465\u2032, \ud466\u02c6\u2032) rather than each actual wage (and to the extent that the errors have mean zero).29\nIn their approach to estimation Gautier and Teulings (2006) propose additional ways of incorporating\nmeasurement error and finite samples that might also be applicable to our setting. Other complications\nthat our simplified exposition does not take care of concerns wage increases on the job, for example\nbecause of human capital accumulation, because of backloaded incentives in wage-tenure contracts, or\nbecause of outside offers that bid up the wages. As long as wages increase deterministically, the costs of\nsearch can still be backed out by the difference between the highest present value of wages in a spell of\nemployment and the lowest present value. Issues of stochastic evolvement of wages and of short panels\nfor workers require more careful assessment that goes beyond the current setup.\n10. More General Technologies. Above, we have shown that the strength of sorting can be\nidentified. We have explored this in a setting where higher types produce more for any given type on\nthe other side, and where matching bands are monotone which gives some order on the firms. Yet the\nfact that we can achieve identification without knowledge of the sign of sorting provides a hint that the\norder of firms in terms of productivity is not crucial for the identification strategy. It suggests that our\nanalysis extends to an even broader class of production functions that do not permit a clear order on\nfirms. While we do not have a general theorem on the breath of possible production functions for which\nof our method delivers identification, we illustrate its applicability in a setup without any clear order\non the firms. Suppose output is maximized when \u201csimilar\u201d agents match. In such a setting there is no\nranking of better jobs. Nevertheless, we can still identify how strong the complementarity is between\nagents with a slight adaptation our approach. Think of workers and firms as being located on a circle\nwith circumference 1. Two types \ud465, \ud466 \u2208 [0, 1] then have a distance \ud451(\ud465, \ud466) = min\ud458\u2208{\u22121,0,1} \u2223\ud465 \u2212 \ud466 + \ud458\u2223,\nand the output they produce is a decreasing function of their distance given by \ud453(\ud465, \ud466) = 1\u2212 \ud6fc\ud451(\ud465, \ud466)2\nfor some parameter \ud6fc > 0 (this production function is studied by Gautier, Teulings and van Vuuren\n(2008), who additionally analyze on-the-job search). In this setup types 0 and 1 are neighbors and\noutput of their match is high. Under the assumption of common constant search costs \ud450, equation (27)\nimplies that the difference between the maximum wage that a worker obtains and the minimum wage\ndivided by his bargaining share recovers \ud450. One way to then apply a version of equation (25) is to note\nthat a worker who matches with a fraction \ud467 of the firms matches only with firms up to a distance\n\ud467\/2 away, and so \ud466(\ud465) = \ud465 \u2212 \ud467\/2. Given this distance of \ud467\/2 between the worker type and the lowest\nfirm type that he matches with, equation (25) immediately allows us to recover the magnitude of the\ncross-partial. The main point of this argument is to show that the comparison of the set of firms an\nagent is willing to match with against the costs from search is informative about the importance of\nsorting even in environments with other non-monotone production technologies.\n29As long as the distance between (\ud465, \ud466\u02c6) and (\ud465\u2032, \ud466\u02c6\u2032) is not completely negligible such an approach is indeed feasible\nusing modern data sets, because of the sheer amount of available data for example in the Danish Integrated Database for\nLabor Market Research that essentially covers the whole population of Denmark.\n31\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper we pursue two goals. First, we use the well-known model of sorting by Becker (1973)\nto gain insights into the wage setting process in a competitive environment, which serves as a natural\nbenchmark. We extend that model in the smallest possible way to allow for equilibrium mismatch while\nretaining the basic idea underlying the assortative matching model. This allows us to provide analytical\nexpressions for the mismatched wages in the model, to characterize the property that equilibrium wages\nare non-monotonic in firm type, and to provide an explicit version of a fixed effects method used in the\nempirical literature. We show that the latter is not well-suited to identify the sign nor the strength of\nsorting. Identification of the sign of sorting is in general impossible because firms pay wages based on the\nproductivity gain from employing a higher type worker, not because they themselves are productive.\nThe fixed effects approach is not able to identify the strength of sorting either, because even under\npositive sorting the wages are non-monotone in firm type. This non-monotonicity is at odds with the\nbasic fixed-effects identifying assumption, and we show with simple examples that this precludes even\na qualitative assessment of sorting because the firm fixed effect fails to correlate at all with the type of\nthe firms.\nSecond, we propose to abandon the attempt to identify from wage data the sign of sorting. The mere\nfact that wages are determined mainly by the need of different type firms for having a better worker\n(which is based on the cross-partial and not the first derivative) makes such identification difficult.\nUnder submodularity it is the low productivity firms that especially need good workers to increase\ntheir (in terms of levels) meager profits, while under supermodularity it is the productive firms that\nneed skilled workers most. In both cases the firms that need the productive workers most have an\nincentive to pay high wages, which makes identification without profit (per job) data difficult. Yet in\neconomic terms the sign of sorting may be less important than the gain that is achieved by sorting\nworkers into the \u201cright\u201d job. We show that information about this gain can be identified from wage\ndata. We propose a specific method for backing out this strength along the equilibrium path. The\nidentification comes from determining some notion of the size of the set of firms with which a worker\nmatches. If a worker is only willing to match with a small fraction of firms, for a given level of frictions\n(which can also be identified from the data) the complementarities must be large. Similarly, when a\nworker is willing to match with many firm types the complementarities must be weak. This gives a\nwell-defined notion of the dollar-value of the gain from sorting in the market.\n32\n7 Appendix\nProof of Proposition 1\nProof. From equation (5) we obtain the wage schedule. When generated by an underlying production\nprocess that is supermodular \ud453+ this is\n\ud464\u2605,+(\ud465) =\n\u222b \ud465\n0\n\ud453+\ud465 (\ud465\u02dc, \ud465\u02dc)\ud451\ud465\u02dc+ \ud464\n+\n0 ,\nand for a submodular process \ud453\u2212 it is\n\ud464\u2605,\u2212(\ud465) =\n\u222b \ud465\n0\n\ud453\u2212\ud465 (\ud465\u02dc, 1\u2212 \ud465\u02dc)\ud451\ud465\u02dc+ \ud464\u22120 .\nObserve that since \ud464\u2605,+(0) = \ud464+0 and \ud464\n\u2605,\u2212(0) = \ud464\u22120 , both wage schedules can be identical when the\nfree bargaining parameter satisfies \ud464+0 = \ud464\n\u2212\n0 = \ud4640. Then we obtain \ud464\n\u2605,+(\ud465) = \ud464\u2605,\u2212(\ud465) for all \ud465 if\n\ud453+\ud465 (\ud465\u02dc, \ud465\u02dc) = \ud453\n\u2212\n\ud465 (\ud465\u02dc, 1 \u2212 \ud465\u02dc). For any \ud453+(\ud465, \ud466) on [0, 1]2 we can define \ud453\u2212(\ud465, \ud466) = \ud453+(\ud465, 1 \u2212 \ud466) on [0, 1]2.\nThe only restriction is that this function may not be increasing in \ud466, so we may need to \u201caugment\u201d the\nfunction to ensure that \ud453\ud466 is positive. If \ud453\ud465, \ud453\ud466 are bounded, it is sufficient to add a term \ud70f \u22c5 \ud466 where\n\ud70f > 0 is large enough to ensure \ud453\ud466 > 0 everywhere. If \ud453\ud466 is not bounded and negative, we need to add\na function \ud454(\ud466) that increases faster than the decrease of \ud453+(\ud465, 1\u2212 \ud466) in \ud466.\nFixed-Effect Decomposition in Equation (14)\nOur residual is given by\n\ud700\ud465\ud466 = \ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \ud6ff(\ud465)\u2212 \ud713(\ud466)\nFor a given firm \ud466, the requirement that the fixed effect is unbiased requires that the average residual\nacross the workers it matches with in the first period is zero. This means that\u222b\n\ud434(\ud466)\n\ud700\ud465\ud466\ud451\u0393(\ud465\u2223\ud466) =\n\u222b\n\ud434(\ud466)\n(\n\ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \ud6ff(\ud465)\u2212\n\u222b\n\ud434(\ud466)\n[\ud464(\ud465\u02dc, \ud466)\u2212 \ud6ff(\ud465\u02dc)] \ud451\u0393(\ud465\u02dc\u2223\ud466)\n)\n\ud451\u0393(\ud465\u2223\ud466) (36)\n=\n\u222b\n\ud434(\ud466)\n[\ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \ud6ff(\ud465)] \ud451\u0393(\ud465\u2223\ud466)\u2212\n\u222b\n\ud434(\ud466)\n[\ud464(\ud465\u02dc, \ud466)\u2212 \ud6ff(\ud465\u02dc)] \ud451\u0393(\ud465\u02dc\u2223\ud466) = 0,\nwhere in the second line the double integral disappears because the interior integral is constant with\nrespect to the argument of integration of the outer integral and the\n\u222b\n\ud434(\ud466) \ud451\u0393(\ud465\u2223\ud466) = 1 since \u0393(\ud465\u2223\ud466) is a\ncumulative distribution function on \ud434(\ud466). Similarly, for a given worker \ud465 the average residual is zero\nacross the firms that he matches with in the first period, since\u222b\n\ud435(\ud465)\n\ud700\ud465\ud466\ud451\u03a5(\ud466\u2223\ud465) =\n\u222b\n\ud435(\ud465)\n(\n\ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212\n\u222b\n\ud435(\ud465)\n[\ud464(\ud465, \ud466\u02dc)\u2212 \ud713(\ud466\u02dc)] \ud451\u03a5(\ud466\u02dc\u2223\ud465)\u2212 \ud713(\ud466)\n)\n\ud451\u03a5(\ud466\u2223\ud465) (37)\n=\n\u222b\n\ud435(\ud465)\n[\ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \ud713(\ud466)] \ud451\u03a5(\ud466\u2223\ud465)\u2212\n\u222b\n\ud435(\ud465)\n[\ud464(\ud465, \ud466\u02dc)\u2212 \ud713(\ud466\u02dc)] \ud451\u03a5(\ud466\u02dc\u2223\ud465) = 0\nIt is obvious that all transformations remain true if we use log-wages, as long as we define \ud464\ud44e\ud463(\ud465) as\nthe average over the log-wages.\n33\nFinally, observe that our analysis is not affected by the fact that we concentrate on first period\nwages. Assume we look at wages across all matches. Equation (14) remains identical, but we use more\ndata (i.e. also the second-period matches) to obtain the fixed effects. To derive the fixed effects in this\ncase, let \ud44e(\ud466) = inf \ud434(\ud466), \ud44f(\ud465) = inf \ud435(\ud465), \ud44e\u00af(\ud466) = sup\ud434(\ud466) and \ud44f\u00af(\ud465) = sup\ud435(\ud465) denote the boundaries\nof the acceptance sets for the firms and workers. Worker \ud465 and firm \ud466 matches with probability\n\u03a5(\ud44f\u00af(\ud465))\u2212\u03a5(\ud44f(\ud465)) and \u0393(\ud44e\u00af(\ud466))\u2212 \u0393(\ud44e(\ud466)) in the first period, and with complementary probability they\nmatch in the second period.\nIn this case the overall fixed effects are\n\ud6ff\u02c6(\ud465) =\n[\n\u03a5(\ud44f\u00af(\ud465))\u2212\u03a5(\ud44f(\ud465))] \u222b\n\ud435(\ud465)\n[\ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \ud713(\ud466)] \ud451\u03a5(\ud466\u2223\ud465) + [1\u2212\u03a5(\ud44f\u00af(\ud465)) + \u03a5(\ud44f(\ud465))] [\ud464(\ud465, \ud707(\ud465))\u2212 \ud713(\ud707(\ud465))] (38)\n\ud713\u02c6(\ud466) = [\u0393(\ud44e\u00af(\ud466))\u2212 \u0393(\ud44e(\ud466))]\n\u222b\n\ud434(\ud466)\n[\ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212 \ud6ff(\ud465)] \ud451\u0393(\ud465\u2223\ud466) + [1\u2212 \u0393(\ud44e\u00af(\ud466)) + \u0393(\ud44e(\ud466))] [\ud464(\ud707\u22121(\ud466), \ud466)\u2212 \ud6ff(\ud707\u22121(\ud466))](39)\nDue to our symmetry assumptions on \u03a5 and \u0393, substituting (38) into (39) yields exactly equation (17)\nin the main text that characterizes the firm fixed effect. Therefore, the firm fixed effect is not changed.\nThe intuitive reason is that the firm fixed effect is governed by the additional wage beyond the workers\naverage (and in second period matches this is exactly zero), and the same conclusions that we obtain\nfor the first period wages carry over to the entire model.\nDerivation of (20)\nObserve that both \ud464(\ud466+\ud43e, \ud466) and \ud464(\ud466\u2212\ud43e, \ud466) are wages for workers that are exactly indifferent between\nmatching now and not matching. This indifference implies \ud464(\ud466 +\ud43e, \ud466) = \u210e(\ud466 +\ud43e) + \ud6fc(\ud466+\ud43e)\n2\n2 \u2212 \ud450 and\n\ud464(\ud466 \u2212\ud43e, \ud466) = \u210e(\ud466 \u2212\ud43e) + \ud6fc(\ud466\u2212\ud43e)22 \u2212 \ud450. Since the average wage that a worker gets when matching in\nthe first stage is better than not matching, the difference between these wages and the average wage is\nnegative. Using these expressions and the fact that we can write the average wage as\n\ud464\ud44e\ud463(\ud465) =\n\u222b \ud465+\ud43e\n\ud465\u2212\ud43e\n\ud464(\ud465, \ud466)\ud451\u03a5(\ud466\u2223\ud465) = \u210e(\ud465) + \ud6fc\n2\n\ud4652 \u2212 \ud6fc\n4\n\u222b \ud43e\n\u2212\ud43e\n\ud4582\ud710(\ud465+ \ud458\u2223\ud465)\ud451\ud458 (40)\nyields\n\u03a8\u20322(\ud466) = \u2212\n[\n\ud450\u2212 \ud6fc\n4\n\u222b \ud43e\n\u2212\ud43e\n\ud4582\ud710(\ud466 +\ud43e + \ud458\u2223\ud466 +\ud43e)\ud451\ud458\n]\n\ud6fe(\ud466 +\ud43e\u2223\ud466) (41)\n+\n[\n\ud450\u2212 \ud6fc\n4\n\u222b \ud43e\n\u2212\ud43e\n\ud4582\ud710(\ud466 \u2212\ud43e + \ud458\u2223\ud466 \u2212\ud43e)\ud451\ud458\n]\n\ud6fe(\ud466 \u2212\ud43e\u2223\ud466).\nThis effect depends on \ud466 only through the effect on the distribution. Therefore, again this effect is\nzero under a uniform distribution. For other distributions the effect is ambiguous because it relies on\nthe density at the endpoints as well as on the integral over the density. In the special case where the\nderivative of the conditional density \u2202\ud710(\ud466\u2223\ud465)\/\u2202\ud466 = \ud45f is constant the density is linear, and so are the\nconditional densities. In such a case symmetry around zero of \ud4582 ensures that \u221214\n\u222b\ud43e\n\u2212\ud43e \ud458\n2\ud710(\ud44c +\ud458\u2223\ud44c )\ud451\ud458 is\nindependent of \ud44c and the terms in square brackets are identical, which directly leads to the inequalities\nin (20).\n34\nDerivation of (23)\nFirst, consider the case of PAM.

Then the loss from mismatch\ncan be derived as follows, where we use the equality that we just derived in line 2, line 3 follows from\n\ud453\u02c6(\ud465, 1\u2212 \ud466) = \ud453(\ud465, \ud466) and \ud466\u02c6 = 1\u2212 \ud466, and the last line follows from similar steps that led to (42):\n\ud453(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212\n\u222b \ud465\n0\n\ud453\ud465(\ud465\n\u2032, 1\u2212 \ud465\u2032)\ud451\ud465\u2032 \u2212\n\u222b \ud466\n0\n\ud453\ud466(1\u2212 \ud466\u2032, \ud466\u2032)\ud451\ud466\u2032 \u2212 \ud453(0, 0).\n= \ud453(\ud465, \ud466)\u2212\n\u222b \ud465\n0\n\ud453\ud465(\ud465\n\u2032, 1\u2212 \ud465\u2032)\ud451\ud465\u2032 +\n\u222b 1\n\ud466\n\ud453\ud466(1\u2212 \ud466\u2032, \ud466\u2032)\ud451\ud466\u2032 \u2212 \ud453(0, 1)\n= \ud453\u02c6(\ud465, \ud466\u02c6)\u2212\n\u222b \ud465\n0\n\ud453\u02c6\ud465(\ud465\n\u2032, \ud465\u2032)\ud451\ud465\u2032 \u2212\n\u222b 1\n1\u2212\ud466\u02c6\n\ud453\u02c6\ud466(1\u2212 \ud466\u2032, 1\u2212 \ud466\u2032)\ud451\ud466\u2032 \u2212 \ud453\u02c6(0, 0)\n= \ud453\u02c6(\ud465, \ud466\u02c6)\u2212\n\u222b \ud465\n0\n\ud453\u02c6\ud465(\ud465\n\u2032, \ud465\u2032)\ud451\ud465\u2032 \u2212\n\u222b \ud466\u02c6\n0\n\ud453\u02c6\ud466(\ud466\n\u2032, \ud466\u2032)\ud451\ud466\u2032 \u2212 \ud453\u02c6(0, 0)\n= \u2212\n\u222b \ud465\n\ud466\u02c6\n\u222b \ud465\n\ud466\u2032\n\ud453\u02c6\ud465\ud466(\ud465\n\u2032, \ud466\u2032)\ud451\ud465\u2032\ud451\ud466\u2032.\n35\nReferences\n[1] Abowd, J.M., F.
