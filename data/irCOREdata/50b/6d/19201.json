The spread of TB has been fa-\ncilitated in recent decades due to the susceptibility of HIV-\ninfected individuals toMycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiological\nagent of TB (2). The problem has been compounded by the\nemergence of multi- and extensively drug-resistant M. tuber-\nculosis strains (3). M. tuberculosis resides within the family of\nCorynebacteriaceae. A common feature of this family is that they\npossess an unusual cell-wall architecture dominated by an es-\nsential heteropolysaccharide termed arabinogalactan (AG),\nwhich is linked to both mycolic acids and peptidoglycan, forming\nthe mycolyl\u2013arabinogalactan\u2013peptidoglycan complex (4\u20136). The\nformation of the arabinan domain of AG results from the sub-\nsequent addition of arabinofuranose (Araf) residues by a set of\nunique arabinofuranosyltransferases (AraTs). The front-line\ndrug ethambutol (EMB) has been shown to target at least three\nAraTs (EmbA, EmbB, and EmbC) (7, 8), but shows no inhibitory\neffects against the other recently identi\ufb01ed cell-wall AraTs, such\nas AftA (9), AftB (10), and AftC (11). In a previous study, we\nsuccessfully deleted MSMEG2785 (Ms-aftC) (11) and showed\nthat this leads to expression of a severely truncated AG structure\nwith branching defects in its arabinan domain. Apart from AG,\nmycobacteria contain several other glycoconjugates. Lipoara-\nbinomannan (LAM), which contains an arabinan domain that is\nstructurally similar to that of AG, is a major component of the\ncell wall. It consists of a core mannan domain covalently linked to a\nmannosyl\u2013phosphatidyl\u2013myo\u2013inositol (MPI) anchor, which makes\nit structurally similar to its biochemical precursor lipomannan\n(LM) (12\u201314). Both LAM and LM exhibit immunomodulatory\nfunctions that may in\ufb02uence the host immune response (reviewed\nin ref. 15). Species-speci\ufb01c differences in the \u201ccapping-motifs\u201d of\nthe nonreducing termini of the arabinan domain\u2014for which three\nvariants exist, i.e., AraLAM, PI-LAM, and ManLAM (16\u201320)\u2014\nhave been shown to be important for this function.\nThe arabinan domain of LAM is attached to an as-yet-\nunidenti\ufb01ed region of the mannan backbone and is thought to be\nsynthesized in a similar manner to that of arabinan found in AG\n(12\u201314). To date, only one AraT has been implicated in the\nbiosynthesis of LAM. This enzyme, EmbC, has also been shown\nto be targeted by EMB, but to a lesser extent than the cell-wall\ncore AraTs, EmbA and EmbB (21, 22). The formation of the\narabinan domain of LAM requires an \u03b1(1\u21923) AraT in a similar\nmanner to AG, thus resulting in the branched motif of LAM.\nHere we investigated the potential role of AftC in LAM bio-\nsynthesis. By analyzing the structure of LAM from a M. smeg-\nmatis \u0394aftC mutant, we demonstrate that AftC carries dual\nfunctionality and is responsible for introducing 3,5-Araf branches\ninto LAM in addition to AG. Furthermore, we show, by treating\nan M. smegmatis \u0394aftC mutant with EMB, that EmbC is involved\nin the very early steps of the LAM arabinan core synthesis and\nthat truncation of this domain modulated the immunological\nproperties of the molecule.\nResults\nEffects of aftC Inactivation on LM\/LAM Biosynthesis. M. smegmatis\nwild type (WT) (Fig. 1, lane 1) and M. smegmatis \u0394aftC lipoglycans\n(Fig. 1, lanes 2\u20134) were puri\ufb01ed using conventional methods (20)\nresulting in the recovery of a highly puri\ufb01ed lipoglycan with an\nintermediate size betweenM. smegmatis LAM and LM, now termed\nAftC-LAM (Fig. 1, lane 3). Complementation ofM. smegmatis\u0394aftC\nwithMs-aftC restored the lipoglycanpro\ufb01le toWTM.smegmatis (Fig.\n1, lane 5). Plasmid-borne Mt-aftC also resulted in complementation\nof the mutant (Fig. 1, lane 6).

The ratio of Ara to Man in\nWT-LAM and AftC-LAM was determined using gas chroma-\ntography (GC) of alditol acetate derivatives (11) (Fig. S2 A and\nC). WT-LAM had a molar ratio of Ara:Man of 2.7:1, which is\nconsistent with previously reported data (22), whereas, for AftC-\nLAM, the Ara:Man ratio was 0.59:1 (Fig. S2 A and C). Com-\nplementation of M. smegmatis \u0394aftC with either Ms-aftC or Mt-\naftC restored the Ara:Man ratio to that of the wild-type LAM\n(Fig. S2 E and G). In M. smegmatis, LAM consists of approx-\nimately 71 Ara, 27 Man, and 1 Ins units (22, 23). The loss of 7\nkDa for AftC-LAM equates to 45 Ara residues, suggesting that\nAftC-LAM contains one or more short arabinan domains of up\nto \u223c16 Ara residues. The 1H-NMR spectrum of WT-LAM (Fig.\n2A) was much more complex than the anomeric region of AftC-\nLAM (Fig. 2B). Indeed, the AftC-LAM 1D 1H spectrum exhibits\nthree major, well-de\ufb01ned resonances characterized by several\noverlapping resonances arising from six different classes of gly-\ncosidic residues. On the basis of our data for WT-LAM and\npreviously published work (19), the 13C resonance at \u03b4101 ppm that\ncorrelated to an anomeric proton at \u03b45.15 ppm with a 1JH1,C1\ncoupling constant of \u2248170 Hz was assigned as 2,6-Manp. The\nresonances at \u03b4105 and \u03b4102.3, correlating to protons at \u03b45.07\nand \u03b44.90, were assigned as t-Manp and 6-Manp, respectively.\nThe t-\u03b2-Araf residues corresponded to \u03b4103.4 with 1H at \u03b45.16.\nThe well-separated spin systems for 2-\u03b1-Araf attached to the 3-\nposition (2-\u03b1-Araf\u21923, \u03b4108.2, \u03b45.27 ppm) and the 5-position (2-\n\u03b1-Araf\u21925, \u03b4108.5, \u03b45.20) of the 3,5-Araf were also visible in the\nspectra of WT-LAM. Several spin systems were observed (\u03b4110.3\nand \u03b45.19 ppm, \u03b4110.3 and \u03b45.14 ppm, and \u03b4110.3 and \u03b45.11\nppm) assigned to 5-\u03b1-Araf in different chemical environments\nwith one overlapping set of 3,5-\u03b1-Araf (\u03b4110.2-\u03b45.12) for WT-\nLAM. As reported, two distinct chemical shifts of t-\u03b1-Araf could\noccur for the respective arms of a branched 3,5-\u03b1-Araf, as\nobserved for 2-\u03b1-Araf\u21923 and 2-\u03b1-Araf\u21925 (19). In AftC-LAM\n(Fig. 2B), the resonances associated with the mannan core (t-\nManp, 6-Manp, and 2,6-Manp) are conserved, but resonances\nassociated with Araf residues are notably less abundant. In\nparticular, 2-\u03b1-Araf\u21923 is absent and the complex set of signals\nfor the different 5-\u03b1-Araf are much more simpli\ufb01ed due to the\nloss of 3,5-\u03b1-Araf (Fig. 2B). GC\/MS of per-O-methylated alditol\nacetate derivatives con\ufb01rmed this result in that it showed an\nunaltered glycosidic linkage pro\ufb01le for the mannan backbone of\nboth WT- and AftC-LAM and a complete loss of 3,5-Araf and a\nsigni\ufb01cant reduction in t-Araf, 2-Araf, and 5-Araf-linkages for\nthe latter LAM (Fig. S2 B and D). Complementation of M.\nsmegmatis \u0394aftC with either Ms-aftC or Mt-aftC restored the\nglycosyl linkage pro\ufb01le to that of WT (Fig. S2 F and H), demon-\nstrating that MSMEG2785 (Ms-aftC) and Rv2673 (Mt-aftC) are\nfunctional orthologs. Overall, the compositional analysis suggests\nthat, as compared to WT-LAM, AftC-LAM has an unaltered\nmannan domain composed of an \u03b1(1\u21926)-Manp backbone sub-\nstituted by t-Manp units atO-2 positions, to which is attached one\nor more short \u03b1(1\u21925)-linked linear arabinan chains (in total\nrepresenting \u224812\u201315 Araf units) terminating in a single \u03b2(1\u21922)\nAra residue (Fig. S3).\nEffect of Ethambutol on AftC-LAM Formation. EMB blocks cell-wall\narabinan biosynthesis by targeting the Emb proteins (7, 8). Al-\nthough EmbC is known to be involved in LAM arabinan biosyn-\nthesis (22), its precise role is as yet inconclusive. We exploited the\nphenotype ofM. smegmatis \u0394aftC and the structural properties of\nAftC-LAM to investigate this role. For this, we treated [14C]-\nglucose-labeled cultures of M. smegmatis with subinhibitory con-\ncentrations of EMB, extracted the lipoglycans, and performed a\nradiochemical quanti\ufb01cation of [14C]-incorporated sugars. SDS\u2013\nPAGE analysis of the [14C]-LM\/LAM pool of WT M. smegmatis\nrevealed two broad bands corresponding to LAM and LM\nmigrating to their expected sizes (Fig. 3A, lane 1) and an Ara:Man\nratio of 1.2:1 (Fig. 3B, lane 1). Subsequent analysis of the [14C]-\nLM\/LAM lipoglycan pool from M. smegmatis \u0394aftC resulted in\nlabeling of AftC-LAM and LM (Fig. 3A, lane 2) and an Ara:Man\nratio of 0.5:1 (Fig. 3B, lane 2). Addition of EMB at 0.5 \u03bcg\u00b7ml\u22121\nresulted in a decrease in the size of the AftC-[14C]-LAM, an\naccumulation of [14C]-LM (Fig. 3A, lane 3), and a corresponding\nchange in the Ara:Man ratio of 0.3:1 (Fig. 3B, lane 3).

Expanded regions (\u03b4 1H: 5.0\u20135.30; \u03b4 13C: 101\u2013111) are shown.\nBirch et al. PNAS | February 9, 2010 | vol. 107 | no. 6 | 2635\nM\nIC\nRO\nBI\nO\nLO\nG\nY\nAftC-LAM contains an intact mannan core, the only possible\neffect of EMB is the direct inhibition of EmbC activity [addition\nof the terminal \u03b2(1\u21922) Araf residues by AftB is insensitive to\nEMB (9)], thus showing its involvement in the very early stages of\nLAM arabinan biosynthesis and inhibition of an \u03b1(1\u21925) AraT.\nNotably, we observed that residual [14C]-Ara labeling always\nremained upon EMB treatment (Fig. 3B, lane 3), suggesting that\nanother AraT possibly adds the \ufb01rst Araf residue to LM, akin to\nAftA in AG biosynthesis (9).\nAftC-LAM Displays Proin\ufb02ammatory Properties. LMs, in contrast to\nLAMs, are potent proin\ufb02ammatory lipoglycans (24\u201327). This\ndifference has been attributed to the presence of the arabinan\ndomain in LAM, which masks the \u201cbioactive\u201d mannan core (24,\n28). To investigate the consequence of the aftC mutation on the\nproin\ufb02ammatory activity of LAM, we compared WT- and AftC-\nLAM for release of TNF-\u03b1 by human THP1 cells. Consistent\nwith earlier studies (24), truncated AftC-LAM, as compared to\nWT-LAM, exhibited an increased proin\ufb02ammatory activity (Fig.\n4A). LM is a known agonist for TLR2 (29). Therefore, we\ninvestigated the ability of WT- and AftC-LAM to activate this\nreceptor. HEK293 cells expressing TLR2 were stimulated with\nincreasing amounts of LAM after which TLR2-dependent IL-8\nproduction was determined. As shown in Fig. 4B, AftC-LAM\ninduced a much stronger TLR2 activation than did WT-LAM\n(\u223c10-fold). This result demonstrates that the presence of the\nfull-length arabinan domain somehow hampered TLR2 activa-\ntion. Previously, it has been reported that immune stimulatory\nactivity of some M. smegmatis LAM preparations may have been\ncaused by lipopeptide contamination (26). To investigate this\nissue, both WT and AftC-LAM were pretreated with H2O2 [a\nprocedure that inactivates lipopeptides (30, 31)], after which they\nwere retested for their activity on HEK293 TLR2 cells. As shown\nin Fig. 4C, pretreatment with H2O2 substantially reduced the\nactivity of both WT- and AftC-LAM. However, in contrast to\nWT-LAM, which lost all of its activity, a substantial part of the\nactivity arising from AftC-LAM was sustained for up to 168 h of\ntreatment (Fig. 4C). This was not due to the inactivation of the\nH2O2 itself because addition of fresh H2O2 after 96 h did not\nfurther reduce the activity (Fig. 4C). Therefore, we conclude that\nboth LAM preparations were probably contaminated with lip-\nopeptides to a certain extent. Nevertheless, inactivation of these\nmolecules with H2O2 clearly demonstrated that AftC-LAM was\nable to activate TLR2, whereas WT-LAM became completely\ninactive for concentrations up to 100 \u03bcg\u00b7ml\u22121 (Fig. 4D).\nTo determine whether the increased proin\ufb02ammatory activity\nof AftC-LAM indeed coincided with a more exposed mannan\ndomain, the ability ofWT- and AftC-LAM to interact with a human\nimmunoglobulin G Fc construct harboring the extracellular domain\nof the C-type lectin dendritic-cell-speci\ufb01c ICAM-3-grabbing non-\nintegrin (DC-SIGN) was investigated. DC-SIGN is highly expressed\non dendritic cells and recognizes high-mannose structures (32, 33)\nincluding LM (34) but not PILAM (35). As shown in Fig. 4E, the\nreactivity of DC-SIGN\u2013Fc toward AftC-LAM was stronger as\ncompared to the reactivity againstWT-LAM,demonstrating that the\nmannan core of AftC-LAM was more accessible.\nDiscussion\nThe data described in this article unequivocally demonstrate that\nAftC is responsible for introducing 3,5-Araf branching in the LAM\narabinan domain of M. smegmatis and proposes a previously\nundescribedmodel for LAMbiosynthesis (Fig. 5). Furthermore, we\nshow that EmbC is involved in the very early stages of LAM ara-\nbinan biosynthesis and that, with the truncation of the arabinan\ndomain, LAM gains the ability to activate TLR2. Although the\nstructure of the arabinan domain of LAM is well understood, less\nis known of the enzymes involved in its biosynthesis. One important\nreason is that Corynebacterium glutamicum, a preferred model\norganism to study mycobacterial AG and LM biosynthesis (9\u201311),\ndoes not produce a convoluted LAM, as present in mycobacteria.\nDuring our investigation of various putative GT-C glycosyl-\ntransferases, we deleted msmeg2785 (AftC) from M. smegmatis,\nwhich resulted in a phenotype that displayed a severely truncated\nAG (11). In the present study, we revisited this mutant in an\nattempt to investigate the potential role of AftC in LAM biosyn-\nthesis. Chemical analysis revealed that LAM isolated from the aftC\nmutant contained an unaltered mannan core, but with one or more\nsimple arabinan moieties of \u224812\u201316 Araf units composed of\n\u03b1(1\u21925) linkages terminating in a single \u03b2(1\u21922) fashion. It is rea-\nsonable to conclude from our data that AftC is not involved in early\narabinanLAMbiosynthesis because amore pronounced truncation\nof LAM would then be expected. AftC has dual functionality in\nterms of its involvement in the biosynthesis of both AG and LAM.\nAttempts to generate an aftC-de\ufb01cient strain of M. tuberculosis\nproved unsuccessful (36), highlighting the essentiality of aftC in\nM. tuberculosis and the species\u2019 intolerance to cell-wall changes.\nHence, AftC represents an excellent drug target.\nEmbC has long been implicated in the biosynthesis of myco-\nbacterial LAM and has been shown to be a target of the front-line\ndrug EMB (21, 22). However, speculation around its precise\nenzymatic function has remained controversial. By using the unique\nphenotype of M. smegmatis \u0394aftC, we provide unequivocal evi-\ndence that EmbC is an \u03b1(1\u21925) AraT, which is inhibited by EMB\n(Fig. 3). We now propose a working model, whereby an as-yet-\nunidenti\ufb01ed GT-C AraT primes the mannan backbone with sin-\ngular Araf residues in much the same way as AftA primes the\ngalactan backbone ofAG (9). After this priming, EmbCextends the\narabinan chain in an \u03b1(1\u21925) fashion before AftC branches the\npolysaccharide with an \u03b1(1\u21923) Araf residue, and the domain is\nfurther matured by a combination of AraTs, including AftC, AftB,\nand perhaps other as-yet-unidenti\ufb01ed enzymes (Fig. 5).\nSeveral mycobacterial cell-wall lipoglycans are proin-\n\ufb02ammatory stimuli of the host immune response. Both LM and\nLAM are members of a family of mycobacterial lipoglycans that\nall contain a conserved MPI anchor (29). Interestingly, LM, in\naddition to being a potent inducer of proin\ufb02ammatory cytokines,\nalso displays strong anti-in\ufb02ammatory properties and represses\nlipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine responses in macro-\nFig. 3.

Recently, by making use of LM preparations, sep-\narated by their degree of acylation, it was demonstrated that\nthese pro- and anti-in\ufb02ammatory properties are, at least in part,\ndependent on the degree of acylation (27, 37). Whereas, tri- and\ntetra-acylated LM forms displayed strong proin\ufb02ammatory pro-\nperties, mono- and di-acylated molecules did not (37). In con-\ntrast, di-acylated LM was found to be the most potent inhibitor\nof LPS-induced cytokine responses, a feature that was indepen-\ndent of TLR2, mannose receptor, or SIGNR1 (27). In addition\nto the degree of acylation, additional structural features of\nMPI-anchored lipoglycans determine their biological activity.\nRecently, it was shown that the chain length of the mannan core\nFig. 4.

PNAS | February 9, 2010 | vol. 107 | no. 6 | 2637\nM\nIC\nRO\nBI\nO\nLO\nG\nY\nof MPI-anchored lipoglycans directly correlated with their ability\nto activate TLR2 (26). Whereas lipoglycans with short oligo-\nmannopyranosyl backbones, such as the PIMs, were marginally\nactive, the TLR2-activating potency of lipoglycans with longer\nbackbones, i.e., LM, was strongly enhanced (26). In addition to\nmannan chain length, the type of substitution of the mannan core\nwas found to be critical, with activity being retained in the case of\nManp substitutions but absent when the core was substituted\nwith Araf residues (26). This was evidently clear for myco-\nbacterial LAMs, which carry a bulky arabinan domain. Although\ntheir LM core would in principle allow for TLR2 activation, the\nLAMs were found to be inactive (26). The assumption that the\narabinan domain is directly involved in \u201csilencing activity\u201d is\nfurther sustained by the observation that chemical degradation\nof the arabinan domain restores the proin\ufb02ammatory properties\nof LAM (24). Our results are in agreement with these \ufb01ndings as\nAftC-LAM, which expresses a severely truncated arabinan do-\nmain, exhibited an increased proin\ufb02ammatory activity (Fig. 4).\nBecause WT and AftC-LAM did not differ in their pattern of\nacylation or core mannan composition, the increased proin-\n\ufb02ammatory activity must be directly related to the shortening of the\narabinan domain. Exactly how the arabinan domain prevents TLR\nactivation is currently not fully understood. One thought is that the\narabinan domain exerts its inhibitory effect by steric hindrance (24).\nAlthough several lines of evidence point to this direction, the exact\nmechanism and the level at which this occurs remains unclear.\nFurthermore, Nigou and coworkers (26) demonstrated that M.\nbovis bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin LAM complexed with soluble\nCD14 ef\ufb01ciently competes with Pam3CSK4 for binding to TLR2,\nsuggesting that binding to, and signaling through TLR2, may not be\nequal. In several mycobacterial species, the nonreducing termini of\nthe branched arabinan domain are modi\ufb01ed by capping motifs\nconsisting of either oligomannosyl, i.e., ManLAMs, or PILAM\nunits such as inM. smegmatis (16). Whereas reports on the immune\nstimulatory properties of ManLAMs are consistent and unambig-\nuously demonstrate that these types of LAMs are inactive (24, 26),\nsome controversy exists on the activity of PILAMs. Early reports\ndemonstrate that PILAM is proin\ufb02ammatory and signals via TLR2\n(17, 24, 38\u201340). However, the mechanism by which a low degree of\ninositol\u2013phosphate capping would confer this proin\ufb02ammatory\nactivity has never been explained. One hypothesis is that themyo\u2013\ninositol\u2013phosphate motif in the MPI-anchored lipoglycans may\nmimic the inositol\u2013phosphate caps on PILAMs, thereby conferring\nactivity. However, the notion that the unsubstituted phospho-\ninositol (PI) caps are unlikely to mimic the acylated MPI anchor,\nplus the observation that PIMs are only marginally active, clearly\ndemonstrates that the PI motif alone does not confer activity (24).\nInterestingly, in a more recent study, Nigou et al. (26) demon-\nstrated that highly puri\ufb01ed PILAMs from M. smegmatis and M.\nfortuitum were equivalent in activity to ManLAMs. Therefore, in\ncontrast to what was previously suggested, the authors concluded\nthat the presence of PI caps did not make LAM proin\ufb02ammatory,\nand they suggested that the activity in earlier experiments was\nprobably due to lipopeptide contamination. Even though con-\ntaminant lipopeptidesmay not be detected by the current analytical\nmethods, trace amounts of these molecules (<0.1%) are enough to\nin\ufb02uence the outcomeofmuchmore sensitive biological assays.We\ntherefore determined the effect of H2O2 treatment on the TLR2-\nstimulating activity of both WT and AftC-LAM. As shown in Fig.\n4C, treatment with H2O2 severely reduced the activity ofWT-LAM\n(PILAM), suggesting that the earlier observed activity was indeed\ndue to lipopeptide contamination. In contrast, although the activity\nof AftC-LAM was also substantially reduced, a stable part of the\nactivity was insensitive to H2O2 treatment (Fig. 4C). Although we\ncannot exclude that H2O2 also acts on LAM and may thereby\nabrogate its activity, the observation that the residual activity of\nAftC-LAM stabilized after 4 days of treatment, instead of gradually\ndeclining further, argues against this notion. Furthermore, H2O2\ntreatment fully inactivated the lipopeptide Pam3CSK4, demon-\nstrating that inactivated lipopeptides do not display any residual\nactivity (Fig. 4C). Overall, these data strongly suggest that the\nproin\ufb02ammatory activity observed in some PILAM preparations\nwas indeed the result of contaminating lipopeptides. Nevertheless,\non the basis of our experiments, we conclude that truncation of the\narabinan domain by the aftC mutation resulted in an increased\nproin\ufb02ammatory activity of AftC-LAM.\nMaterials and Methods\nBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions.
