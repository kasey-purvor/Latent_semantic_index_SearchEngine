Introduction \nIncreasing attention has been focused recently on health effects of exposure to air pollution, \nespecially regarding increased risk of morbidity and mortality from cardio-vascular disease, \ncancer, degenerative brain disease, and respiratory illness (e.g. Knutsen et al., 2004; Pope et \nal., 2002; Schwartz et al., 1996; Schwarze et al., 2006; Calder\u00f3n-Garcidue\u00f1as et al., 2004). \nFor many pollutants, air quality standards refer to levels measured in ambient outdoor air. \nThe sources of fine, combustion-derived pollutants are less well understood for the indoor \nenvironment, prompting studies of relationships between outdoor sources and indoor air \nquality (e.g. Fischer et al., 2000; Kingham et al., 2000; Naumova et al., 2002). Urban sources \nof particles and organic pollutants (volatile and semi-volatile) vary, but principally arise from \nfuel combustion by vehicles, and for space heating and waste incineration. Within the U.K., \nhealth-based air quality standards exist for several key air pollutants, including PM10 \n(particles with diameter <10 \u00b5m) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a high molecular weight \n(MW) PAH, formed during combustion. Both PM10 (plus finer modes) and PAHs are \nfrequently measured in pollution studies (e.g. Fischer et al., 2000; Kingham et al., 2000; Kaur \net al., 2005).  Recently, aerosol magnetic measurements have been used successfully to assess \nurban, traffic-related pollution, both in conjunction with conventional fixed monitoring \nstation air sampling  (Sagnotti et al., 2006; Muxworthy et al., 2002) and using roadside tree \nleaves as natural biomonitoring surfaces (e.g. Matzka & Maher, 1999; Maher et al., 2008; \nGautam et al., 2005).  Magnetic particles are invariably present amongst atmospheric aerosol, \nfrom release of iron-containing impurities in fossil fuels and\/or through metal wear \n(abrasion\/corrosion). These iron-rich emission particles are magnetic, the most common \nphases being magnetite (Fe3O4) and haematite (\u03b1Fe2O3), with magnetisations easily \nmeasurable using a cryogenic magnetometer (e.g. Flanders, 1994). In urban dusts, strong \ncorrelation has been observed between magnetic susceptibility and\/or magnetic remanence \nvalues and PM10 dust-mass (e.g. Sagnotti et al., 2006), sample mutagenicity (Morris et al., \n1995) and lead and iron concentrations (Gautam et al., 2005; Maher et al., 2008).  In areas \n  3 \ndominated by vehicle pollution, rather than industrial point sources (Hanesch et al., 2003), \nmagnetic measurements appear to provide a robust, rapid and cheap proxy for vehicle-\nderived particulate pollution (Matzka and Maher, 1999), enabling high-resolution spatial and \ntemporal sampling. \nHere, we present a pilot study to examine the links between outdoor and indoor air \npollution, innovatively combining magnetic and PAH measurements at different locations in \nLancaster, England. By simultaneously measuring indoor and outdoor concentrations of TSP, \nmagnetic properties and PAHs, assessment can be made of their sources and whether \nincursions of outdoor, traffic-derived pollution influence the indoor environment at these \nsites. \n  \n2. Methods \n2.1 Air sampling \nAir samples were collected (summer 2003) using  high volume (Hi-Vol) air samplers at three \nseparate sites, comprising: Lancaster University campus (LUC); a detached suburban house \nSUB); and a city centre location (CC)  Two Graseby-Anderson PS-1 Hi-Vol air samplers \nwere co-deployed at each site, to sample both indoor and outdoor air. As far as possible, the \nsamplers were sited away from vents, obstructions or local point sources (e.g. cooker, \nfireplace). The indoor locations comprised a teaching laboratory (LUC), a domestic kitchen \n(SUB) and an upstairs, two-storey apartment (CC). At the outdoor locations, a Hi-Vol was \nlocated in a grassed courtyard (LUC), a residential garden (SUB) and close (~ 2 m) to a major \nroad (CC). The outdoor samplers were placed ~ 10m away from any building\/obstruction, \nwith the sample head at ~1.5 m above ground level. Air samples were taken during June - \nJuly 2003, a warm, continuously dry interval, without indoor space heating. At each site, 2-3 \nsamples of outdoor and indoor air were collected, with air sample volumes ranging between \n63.5 - 350 m3, over a 6 to 24 hour period (Table 1). For the magnetic measurements, one Hi-\nVol sampler was fitted with a magnetically-clean Millipore FluoroporeTM membrane (PTFE) \nfilter (1\u00b5m pore-size) for particle collection; the other with a Whatman glass-fibre filter \n(GFF) and two polyurethane foam (PUF) plugs, for sampling particle-bound and vapour \nPAHs, respectively.  \n \n  4 \n2.2 Analysis of TSP, PAHs and magnetic properties. \nFollowing sampling, each Hi-Vol sample head (sealed in zip-lock plastic bags) was returned \nto the laboratory where the GFF\/PUFs were stored in a freezer (-20 oC) prior to analysis. TSP \nvalues were determined gravimetrically using the PTFE filters (pre-weighed), placed in a \nmodified vacuum desiccator maintained at nominal but constant humidity.  \nFor PAH analysis, both GFFs and PUF plugs underwent separate soxhlet extraction in \ndichloromethane (DCM) for 16 h. Extracts were then concentrated on a Buchi-rotary \nevaporator (~1 mL) and subjected to column chromatography to remove co-extractants. Each \nsample was eluted through alumina(1g)\/silica(1g) with 25 mL of 1:1 DCM\/n-hexane. The \neluant was gently reduced in volume under a stream of pure N2 allowing solvent exchange to \nacetonitrile (CH3CN), with a final sample volume of 500 \u00b5L. Analysis was performed on a \nPerkin-Elmer HPLC, with an auto-sampler (20 \u00b5L injection volume) and an LS-40 \nFluorescence Detector. PAHs were separated on a ChromSep C18 reverse-phase column using \na mobile phase comprising CH3CN\/H2O. The detector was programmed with \nexcitation\/emission wavelengths ranging between 200-420 nm. Qualification of 15 separate \nPAHs (Table 1) was based on comparative retention times with a PAH standard (containing \nall the PAHs), and quantification achieved using six calibration standards ranging from 10 \u2013 \n400 ng\/mL, run at the start and end of each sample batch. Four samples (2 GFF and 2 PUF \u2013 \nLUC, SUB) were also analysed by GC-MS (HP5890 Series-II GC and HP5972 MSD), with \nsample extracts taken up in n-hexane (500 \u00b5L) rather than CH3CN, followed by the addition \nof three deuterated-PAH internal standards (fluorene-\u03b410, pyrene-\u03b410 and B[a]P-\u03b410). The \nGC-MS protocol for PAH analysis (Smith, 2000) involved a cool (60 oC) on-column injection \n(1 \u00b5L) with subsequent PAH separation on a 30m HP5MS column (with a 2 m deactivated \nretention gap) connected to the MSD (EI source (70 eV) operating in SIM). Quantification \nwas based on two sets of calibration standards to cover the linear ranges of 1 \u2013 100 ng\/mL \nand 100-2500 ng\/mL.  \nFor magnetic analysis, each PTFE filter was subjected to acquisition of anhysteretic \nremanence (ARM), imparted using a Molspin AF demagnetiser with a peak A.F. of 85 \nmilliTesla (mT) and D.C. field of 0.08 mT, measured using a cryogenic magnetometer (CCL \nLtd., with a noise level of 10-10 Amperes(A)m2). ARM is expressed here as a susceptibility of \nARM (\u03c7ARM), normalised by the D.C. field. After A.F. demagnetisation of the ARM, each \nsample was magnetised (at room temperature) using incremental, pulsed D.C. fields of 100 \nand 300 mT, using a Molspin Pulse Magnetiser, and then 1 Tesla (T), using a Newport \n  5 \nelectromagnet.  The magnetic remanence (IRM) was measured immediately after each \nmagnetising step. IRM values were normalised for air sample volume (Am2\/m3 \u2013 thus Am-1) \nand particulate mass\/m3 of sampled air (Am-1g-1).  \n \n2.3. Quality controls \nGFFs were baked overnight at 450 oC prior to use and PUF plugs were pre-cleaned via \nsoxhlet extraction in DCM for 24 h.  A set of GFF & PUF field blanks was generated for each \nlocation with contamination found to be low. GC-MS analysis of blanks and samples \nrevealed the presence of several methylated naphthalenes and phenathrenes, but these are not \nreported here due to their erratic occurrence in the blank PUFs, and subsequent high method \ndetection limits. Comparison between the LC and GC results was good, individual PAH \nconcentrations varying by \u00b115 %. Precision and accuracy of the HPLC and GC-MS methods \nhave been detailed in Halsall et al. (1994) and Smith (2000) and Herbert et al. (2004), \nrespectively. Dibenz[a,h]anthracene was used as a recovery standard, spiked onto both the \nGFF and PUFs prior to soxhlet extraction; recoveries always exceeded 80 %, samples were \nnot recovery corrected. \nSample magnetic values were corrected for the (very low) blank PTFE filter values \n(ARM < 1x10-10 Am2; SIRM < 20x10-10 Am2). GFFs were unsuitable for magnetic analyses, \ndue to high blank magnetic remanences. All magnetic measurements were carried out without \nknowledge of sample site or date. \n \n2.4 Statistical analysis. \nA multivariate statistical method, non-linear mapping (NLM, using the programme of Vriend \net al., 1988), was applied to the combined magnetic and PAH datasets. NLM scales and \ncalculates the distance between datapoints in multidimensional space, then translates this into \ntwo dimensions (Vriend et al., 1988). Three diagnostic magnetic parameters were included: \nSIRM (mass-normalised), \u03c7ARM\/SIRM, and the percentages of high-field IRM (HIRM, i.e. the \nremanence acquired between 300 and 1000 mT). The SIRM reflects the concentration of \nmagnetic minerals, the \u03c7ARM\/SIRM ratio the contribution of ultrafine magnetite grains (~ 20-\n30 nm), and HIRM the presence of haematite (if the HIRM resists subsequent \ndemagnetisation). Data for two PAHs were also included: total phenanthrene (3 ring PAH) \nand B[a]P (5 ring PAH). Before analysis, the parameters were tested for autocorrelation using \nthe non-parametric Spearman test.  \n \n  6 \n3. Results.  \n3.1 PAHs, suspended particulate concentrations. \nTable 1 summarises the PAH concentrations observed at the three sites. For the outdoor air, \nhighest PAH concentrations were observed at the city centre, with values within the ranges \nmeasured in other, UK urban environments. For example, from the UK\u2019s Toxic Organic \nMicropollutants Survey, \u03a3PAH concentrations ranged from ~20-150 ng\/m3 in London and \nManchester, respectively (Coleman et al., 1997). Similarly, roadside measurements in \nBirmingham revealed \u03a3PAH concentrations between 28.5-54.8 ng\/m3 (Dimashki et al., \n2001).  However, here the \u03a3PAH concentrations (Table 1) are dominated by the lower MW, \n2-3 ring compounds of acenaphthene, fluorene and phenanthrene, with the highest \nconcentrations of these predominantly vapour phase compounds observed in indoor air, \nparticularly at the campus and suburban sites. Average individual PAH concentrations for \nboth indoor and outdoor air (Figure 1) illustrate the dominance of the lower MW compounds \nin indoor air and the higher MW PAHs in outdoor air. The high PAH concentrations in \nindoor air at the campus and suburban sites will be discussed later, but the campus was the \nonly indoor site where concentrations of the higher MW, particle-bound PAHs were \ncomparable with the city centre outdoor air. TSP concentrations (Figure 2) ranged from 20-\n125 \u00b5g\/m3, the highest concentration observed in one indoor sample from the suburban \nhouse. High levels of TSP (60-95 \u00b5g\/m3) were also observed in the indoor air of the city \ncentre apartment.  For the outdoor air samples, highest TSP concentrations were measured at \nthe city centre (mean  40 \u00b5g\/m3). \n \n3.2 Magnetic properties \nFigure 3 shows the SIRMs for each indoor and outdoor site, normalised with air volume (a) \nand particulate mass (b), respectively. On an air-volume basis, sites with notably high SIRM \nvalues are the suburban indoor and two of the city centre outdoor samples.  When normalised \nfor particulate mass, the two city centre outdoor samples (sampled on week days), and the \nsuburban indoor samples display enhanced SIRMs, compared with very low values for the \nother indoor samples.  The remaining outdoor city centre sample (sampled on a Sunday) has \nan SIRM comparable with the outdoor suburban and campus samples.  The percentage of \nIRM acquired below 100 mT varies from 62 \u2013 76 %; all the outdoor samples (mean 72 %) \nshow higher values than indoors (mean 67 %).   After application of a 300 mT field, the \nsamples had acquired 94 \u2013 98 % of their SIRM.  The suburban indoor samples are notable \n  7 \n(figure 4); they display greatest high-field acquisition (i.e. ~ 5 \u2013 6 % IRM gain between 300 \nmT and 1 T) but most of this high-field remanence is unstable and lost upon A.F. \ndemagnetisation at 100 mT, behaviour characteristic of maghemite, the oxidised counterpart \nof magnetite (Liu et al., 2002; Maher et al., 2004).  All the other samples retain varying \nproportions of their HIRM, indicating the presence of \u2018hard\u2019 haematite-like phases.  Highest \n\u03c7ARM\/SIRM ratios (figure 4), reflecting the presence of submicrometre (~ 20-30 nm) \nferrimagnets (Maher, 1988; \u00d6zdemir & Banerjee, 1982), characterise the city centre indoor \nsamples; all the outdoor samples display moderate values, indicative of ferrimagnets of ~ 1 \n\u00b5m (Ozdemir & Banerjee, 1982; Maher, 1988). \nFigure 5a and b summarise the relationships between the SIRM values (mass-\nnormalised) and phenanthrene and B[a]P concentrations (where detectable).  The two week-\nday city centre outdoor samples display high SIRM and B[a]P values (figure 5a), in contrast \nwith the Sunday sample, with relatively low SIRMs and moderate B[a]P values, similar to the \ntwo suburban outdoor samples. The campus outdoor samples display moderate SIRM and \nlow B[a]P.  Sample clustering is also evident in figure 5b.  The two week-day city centre \noutdoor samples, and one suburban indoor sample, show high SIRM and very low \nphenanthrene values. The Sunday city centre outdoor sample groups with the other outdoor \nsamples, with low\/moderate SIRMs and very low phenanthrene values.  The city centre \nindoor samples are distinctive, with minimal SIRM and maximal phenanthrene values.   \nWith the caveat of the small sample size, the magnetic property and PAH data can be \ncombined, to optimise sample characterisation and differentiation, by applying non-linear \nmapping. Not only is separation of outdoor from the indoor samples evident (figure 6); the \nindoor samples also show distinct and separate groupings. The city centre outdoor samples \ncluster, with high SIRM and high B[a]P values, as do the suburban and campus outdoor \nsamples, these characterised by low phenanthrene and moderate SIRM values. The suburban \nindoor samples and one of the campus indoor samples (coinciding with laboratory loss-on-\nignition experiments) approach the outdoor sample grouping. The city centre indoor samples \nform a separate, clustered group. \n \n4. Discussion.  \nThe relatively high concentrations of 2-3 ring PAHs in the indoor environments sampled here \nmirror results from an extensive U.S. survey, part of the Relationship of Indoor, Outdoor and \nPersonal Air (RIOPA) study (e.g. Naumova et al, 2002). In RIOPA, \u03a3PAH concentrations in \n  8 \nindoor air exhibited a wide range in concentrations (~16-350 ng\/m3) with the upper range \nexceeding that found in the corresponding outdoor atmospheres. High levels of 3-4 ring \nPAHs in indoor air accounted for these high concentrations while conversely, the heavier 5-7 \nring PAHs were found to have higher concentrations in the outdoor air. The results from our \nstudy are in broad agreement, but distinctive indoor combustion sources may have produced \nPAH anomalies at our campus and suburban indoor sites. The notably high indoor PAH \nconcentrations at the campus (both vapour- and particle-bound PAH), associated with low \nTSP and IRMs, were probably due to soil combustion in a laboratory furnace (a procedure \ncarried out at the time of sampling). At the suburban site, indoor air concentrations of the \nlighter PAHs were high, and associated with high TSP concentrations and SIRMs. We \nsuggest this distinctive signature reflects the presence of a cast-iron, solid-fuel stove in the \nroom adjacent to the air sampler. While this stove was not in use during sampling, the \npresence of wood ash in an open iron grate may account for both the high particulate loading \nand magnetisations (i.e. large numbers of Fe-containing and ferrimagnetic particles), \naccompanied by high particle-bound concentrations of 2-3 ring PAHs. Similarly, the indoor \nair at the city centre apartment also contained elevated 2-3 ring PAH concentrations relative \nto the outdoor air samples. Whilst its TSP concentrations were similar to the outdoor air, it \ndisplays much lower SIRM values (both volume- and mass-normalised), and high \u03c7ARM\/SIRM \nratios (figure 4), indicating the presence of sub-micrometre magnetic grains, again suggesting \na specific and distinctive indoor source. (Sub-micrometre magnetic particles often occur as \ninteracting agglomerates, and hence are effectively sampled even on the 1\u00b5m pore-size filter \nused).  \nIn summary, the indoor air samples show wide variation over the three study sites, with \nPAHs, magnetic properties and TSP concentrations reflecting distinctive indoor sources. \nWhile the small number of samples precludes statistical comparison between outdoor and \nindoor concentrations of particles, PAHs and magnetic particles, there is little evidence of \ningress of outdoor air as a source of these pollutants. Particulate PAH concentrations and \nSIRM both differ markedly between indoor and outdoor environments. Hence, several of the \nindoor air samples appear as outliers (e.g. LUC- I1, 2 and CC-I1, 3 in Figure 4), grouped \nseparately from the outdoor samples. For the outdoor samples, while their range of \n\u03c7ARM\/SIRM values is quite narrow (~10-15 x10-5A\/m), statistically significant correlations are \nobserved between \u03c7ARM\/SIRM ratios and particulate-concentrations of phenathrene and B[a]P \n(r2 = 0.55, n=7, p<0.05 and r2 = 0.68, n=7, p<0.05, respectively), with \u03c7ARM\/SIRM ratios \n  9 \ndeclining in the order city centre>suburban>campus. This trend indicates finer magnetic \nparticle sizes at the city centre and a significant link between ultrafine magnetic particles and \nPAHs. This link is likely to be controlled by traffic emissions, given that outdoor samples \nfrom the city centre had the highest particulate PAH concentrations and high SIRM (>425 \nx10-4 Am-1g-1). Association of PAHs with finer particle fractions (e.g. <1 \u00b5m diameter) has \nbeen demonstrated in the urban environment and in vehicle emissions (e.g. Allen et al 1996; \nZielinska et al., 2004). Notably, the outdoor city centre sample collected on a Sunday (CC-\nO1), when traffic was reduced, had lower PAH concentrations and SIRM values than the \nweek-day samples (CC-O2 and 3); the Sunday city centre values are similar to the week-day \nsuburban outdoor samples.  \nAs shown by NLM, the combined magnetic and PAH analyses enable discrimination not only \nbetween outdoor and indoor pollution signals but also between different types of indoor \nsource.  \n \n5. Conclusions \n\u2022 This pilot study reveals notable differences between the pollution characteristics \u2013 \nparticles, PAHs and magnetic properties - of indoor air from three different sampling \nsites.  It suggests that indoor pollution sources vary significantly and there is little \nevidence of the incursion of outdoor air, even in a city centre environment.  \n\u2022 The combined particle-bound PAH and magnetic data provide a powerful tool to \nclassify samples according to likely sources and may provide a valuable diagnostic \ntool to discriminate between indoor and outdoor combustion sources.  Magnetic \nmeasurements may provide a sufficiently specific marker for traffic-derived pollution \nfor use in studies of health effects of vehicle pollution exposure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n\u2022 Given increasing evidence for damage to human health attributable to exposure to \ntraffic-derived pollution, especially for children, more detailed investigation and \nimplementation of these methods seems warranted and timely, preferably using \npassive collectors co-deployed in a variety of indoor environments (different rooms) \nand outdoor locations (especially with regard to traffic proximity). \n \nAcknowledgements. \n  10 \nThe support of the Royal Society through a Royal Society-Wolfson Research Award to BAM \nand a Lancaster University research award are both gratefully acknowledged.

Arithmetic mean air concentrations for PAHs measured at the three sites (black \nbars represent indoor samples and grey bars outdoors). Note the change in scale of the y-axes \nin the right hand plots.  \n \nFigure 2. Total suspended particle (TSP) concentrations for the indoor (I) and outdoor (O) \nsamples. \n \nFigure 3. Saturated isothermal remanence (SIRM) of particles collected on magnetically-\nclean PTFE filters, normalised to the air volume (a) and particle mass (b). \n \nFigure 4. Plot of HIRM vs. \u03c7ARM \/SIRM for the different samples. Increasing values of \n\u03c7ARM\/SIRM indicate smaller magnetic grain size and increasing HIRM (where subsequently \nstable to af demagnetisation) indicates the presence of haematite. The highest HIRM values \nwere observed for the suburban indoor air samples; possibly influenced by a cast-iron stove. \n \nFigure 5.  Relationship between SIRM and particle-bound (a) B[a]P  and  (b) phenanthrene \n \nFigure 6.  Non-linear map (a 2-D projection of the multidimensional magnetic and PAH \ndata) showing the grouping of indoor and outdoor air samples, based on B[a]P, phenanthrene \nand SIRM (mass-normalised), \u03c7ARM\/SIRM, and the percentages of high-field IRM (HIRM, \ni.e. the remanence acquired between 300 and 1000 mT).  The axes are unitless, representing \nstatistical distance rather than any physical parameter. \n \nTable 1. Summary of air samples and sites.  NB Sampled air volumes in the indoor \nenvironments were always considerably less (<30 %) than the internal volume of the property \n(e.g., the internal volume of the CC apartment ~ 500 m3, the largest sampled air volume 141 \nm3). \n \nFigure 1\nAC\nEN\nAP FL\nU\nPH\nEN\nAN\nTH\nFL\nUO\nR\nng\n\/m\n3\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nLancaster Uni Campus\nPY\nR\nB[a\n]A\nCH\nRY B[b\n]F\nB[k\n]F\nB[a\n]P\nD[a\nc]A\nB[g\nhi]P CO\nR\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nSuburban\nAC\nEN\nAP FL\nU\nPH\nEN\nAN\nTH\nFL\nUO\nR\nng\n\/m\n3\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nPY\nR\nB[a\n]A\nCH\nRY B[b\n]F\nB[k\n]F\nB[a\n]P\nD[a\nc]A\nB[g\nhi]P CO\nR\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nCity Centre\nAC\nEN\nAP FL\nU\nPH\nEN\nAN\nTH\nFL\nUO\nR\nng\n\/m\n3\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nPY\nR\nB[a\n]A\nCH\nRY B[b\n]F\nB[k\n]F\nB[a\n]P\nD[a\nc]A\nB[g\nhi]P CO\nR\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nFigure\nFigure 2.\nLU\nC I\n1\nLU\nCI2\nLU\nCO\n1\nLU\nCO\n2\nSU\nBI1\nSU\nBI2\nSU\nBO\n1\nSU\nBO\n2\nSU\nBO\n3\nCC\nI1\nCC\nI2\nCC\nI3\nCC\nO1\nCC\nO2\nCC\nO3\nT\nS\nP\n\/ \uf06d\ng \nm\n-3\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nFigure 3.\nLU\nC I\n1\nLU\nCI2\nLU\nCO\n1\nLU\nCO\n2\nSU\nBI1\nSU\nBI2\nSU\nBO\n1\nSU\nBO\n2\nSU\nBO\n3\nCC\nI1\nCC\nI2\nCC\nI3\nCC\nO1\nCC\nO2\nCC\nO3\nS\nIR\nM\n\/ A\nm\n-1\n (\nx1\n0\n-9\n)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n25\nLU\nC I\n1\nLU\nCI2\nLU\nCO\n1\nLU\nCO\n2\nSU\nBI1\nSU\nBI2\nSU\nBO\n1\nSU\nBO\n2\nSU\nBO\n3\nCC\nI1\nCC\nI2\nCC\nI3\nCC\nO1\nCC\nO2\nCC\nO3\nS\nIR\nM\n\/ A\nm\n-1\ng-\n1  \n(x\n10\n-4\n)\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nFigure 4\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nSUB-I2\nSUB-I1\nLUC-O1\nCC-O1\nSUB-O1 SUB-O3\nCC-O3\nCC-O2\nSUB-O2\nLUC-I1\nLUC-I2\nLUC-02\nCC-I1CC-I2\nCC-I3\nxARM\/SIRM \/(Am-1)-1   (x10-5)     \nH\nIR\nM\n \/%\nFigure5\nB[a]P\/ng \uf06dg-1\n0.000 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.010 0.012\nS\nIR\nM\n \/\nA\nm\n-1\ng\n-1\n  \n(x\n10\n-4\n)\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nCC-O2\nCC-O3\nCC-O1\nSUB-O2\nSUB-O1\nLUC-I1\nLUC-O1\nLUC-O2\n0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nSUB-I2CC-O2\nphenanthrene\/ ng \uf06dg-1\nS\nIR\nM\n \/A\nm\n-1\ng-\n1 \n (x\n10\n-4\n)\nCC-O3\nSUB-I1LUC-O2\nLUC-O1\nCC-O1\nSUB-O1&O2\nLUC-I1 CC-I3 CC-I2\nCC-I1\nFigure 6\n  \n                  \nTable 1.
