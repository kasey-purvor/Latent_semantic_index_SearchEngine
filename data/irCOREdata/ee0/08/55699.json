Providers of family\nplanning services are increasingly being\nurged to adopt a broader remit in\nrespect of their clients\u2019 needs for STI\nand HIV prevention and treatment,1 as\nare providers of STI services in respect of\ntheir clients\u2019 contraceptive needs.\nAlthough fully integrated sexual health\nservices are still comparatively rare, a\ngrowing number of family planning\nservices provide STI diagnosis and treat-\nment and a growing number of GUM\nclinics provide contraceptive services.2 3\nThe trend may be accelerated as a result\nof the government\u2019s sexual health strat-\negy,4 in England. The systematic evalua-\ntion of three pilot \u2018\u2018one stop shops\u2019\u2019 is\nlikely to provide more robust evidence\non the acceptability and effectiveness of\nintegrated services which, if favourable,\ncould provide the impetus to further\nexpansion.\nIn theory, the case for an integrated\napproach to sexual health service provi-\nsion is compelling. Control of fertility\nand of sexually transmitted infection\nshare common characteristics. The\nchoice of contraceptive method may\nhave implications for transmission of\ninfectious agents and the presence of\ninfection has consequences for fertility.\nThe two services also share potential\nclients. Studies of GUM clinic attenders\nhave shown a high proportion to be at\nrisk of pregnancy5\u20139 and studies of\nfamily planning clinics attenders show\nsizeable proportions to be at risk of\ninfection.7 10 11 There is also evidence\nthat service users prefer a one stop\nservice providing coordinated sexual\nhealth care.7 12 13 Advocates of integra-\ntion claim that coordination of family\nplanning and GUM services has the\npotential to boost the effectiveness of\nboth, broadening opportunities for\nscreening and prevention, reducing dup-\nlication of services, providing continuity\nof care, and making maximum use of\nfinite resources.2 14\u201316\nThe shift towards a broader remit has,\nhowever, clear implications for training\nof personnel working in each of the two\nspecialties.1 Broader based training is\nseen as an essential prerequisite to more\nholistic provision. Healthcare profes-\nsionals in each of the specialties need\nat least a basic knowledge and skills of\nthe other in order to provide a holistic\napproach to sexual health care.17\nInsecurities relating to the prospect of\ntaking on new working roles are com-\nmonly attributed to limitations of pre-\nvious training and experience.\nUntil recently, training has not been\nconducive to integration.15 18 Anxieties\nhave been expressed that the move\ntowards integrated care may be hin-\ndered by resistance from clinicians con-\nstrained by their training background.19\nThe evolution of integrated services\nclearly needs to take place in parallel\nwith the training of those providing\nthem. There are those who fear that the\ntraining plans may be jumping the gun,\nand that the organisational structures\nshould perhaps remain unchanged until\nsuch a time that the staff are well\nenough equipped to run new integrated\nunits. Yet the more commonly held view\nis that training is lagging behind, and so\nhindering the development of an inte-\ngrated service.17 The move towards\nintegration has been progressing faster\nthan has progress towards the staff\ntraining needed to underpin it and this\nhas been seen by some as a barrier to\nintroducing STI services into family\nplanning.1\nStudies of GUM clinic attenders\nhave shown a high proportion to\nbe at risk of pregnancy and studies\nof family planning clinics attenders\nshow sizeable proportions to be at\nrisk of infection\nDespite recognition of the importance\nof a wider knowledge of sexual health to\nsuccessful working in integrated services,\nin-depth coverage of each specialty is\nnot yet part of current undergraduate\nmedical training. Similarly, family\nplanning trained nurses working in\nexisting integrated services, together\nwith more recent recruits, are likely\nto have received a broader training, yet\nmany who have practised for some\ntime have no GU training. Community\nfamily planning services are increas-\ningly taking on a role in the diagnosis\nand treatment of STIs, but deficiencies\nwith regard to the diagnosis and\nmanagement of STIs have led to\nrecommendations for better training\nfor family planning staff.10\nAs to how training needs might be\nmet, there is not a great deal of\nconsensus. Committed advocates of\nintegrated services are more likely to\nbelieve in the need for comprehensive\ndual training so that staff would be fully\ntrained in both fields. According to this\nperspective, a new breed of consultants,\namong whom the divide between the\nspecialties is apparent in neither train-\ning nor background, is the model for the\nfuture. There are concerns however, on\nhow well equipped practitioners will feel\nto manage the more complicated aspects\nof patient care in both disciplines.\nOthers question whether full dual train-\ning is a realistic or even a necessary goal,\nparticularly in the short term.17 Training\nneeds are likely to be burdensome, since\neach of the two areas have traditionally\nbeen organised as total specialties in\nthemselves, and coverage of both in\ntheir entirety is likely to be taxing. The\ntraining workload of GUM has in itself\nincreased since the advent of HIV and\nadditional training in contraception may\nsimply be too onerous. Similarly, expect-\ning all FP staff to undertake extensive\ntraining in HIV seems unreasonable.\nA modular approach may be the\nanswer, combining basic core training\nto enable those working in one specialty\nto provide care in the other, with higher\nlevel training to equip specialised practi-\ntioners to deal with less run of the mill\nproblems. In practice, this would result\nin a two tier system; two physicians\nwould work in parallel, with consider-\nable overlap between them in terms of\nbasic skills, but with some exclusive\nareas of expertise in which each had\nspecialised training. Having the two\nservices under one roof is likely to\nfacilitate such an approach, but colla-\nboration and cooperation between sites\nis likely to achieve similar ends.\nFor existing professionals, the atten-\ntion is on update training and here the\nchallenges relate to the practical issues\nof finding time and resources. Staffing\nlevels may not permit time off work for\nattendance at training courses. GU trained\nnurses would gain from the opportu-\nnity to acquire practical experience in\n354 EDITORIALS\nwww.stijournal.com\n on 18 January 2006 sti.bmjjournals.comDownloaded from \nfamily planning clinics, yet relatively\nfewer opportunities for observation\nexist in the context of family planning,\ncompared with GUM. Student attach-\nments are rarer in family planning\nsettings, problems of confidentiality\nmay be more pronounced, and some\nhealth professionals are concerned that\nfamily planning staff are not equipped\nto train.17\nBarriers may also exist at service level.\nFor example, services often have to\nundergo significant restructuring to\ncope with increasing client demand.\nOne current example is the move\ntowards the more advanced roles of\nnursing staff. Concurrent developments\nsuch as these also require fundamental\nrestructuring and the implementation of\nnew procedures and protocols, and may\nthemselves create additional obstacles\nto specialty training by limiting the\ncapacity of staff to attend courses.\nThere are, however, more fundamen-\ntal concerns which impact on training.\nOne is the difference in structure and\nculture of the specialties of family\nplanning and GUM. Health practitioners\nworking in family planning and GUM\ncome from separate disciplines and\nfocus on different aspects of health care.\nBroadly speaking, family planning has\ntraditionally been preventive in scope,\nlargely sessional and community\nbased,20 while GUM is predominantly\nmore curative in approach, is seen more\nin terms of a career option, and is\nusually hospital based.17 The divide\nbetween the two specialties may be\nnarrowing as new recruits are socialised\ninto a more holistic ethos. Yet there is a\ndanger that the perceived status\ninequalities which seem to stem from\ndifferences between the two specialties\nmay be more resistant to change.\nSome GUM practitioners question the\ncompetence of family planning staff to\nconduct GUM work and some family\nplanning staff see those working in\nGUM as ill equipped to practise family\nplanning.17 Concerns about diminished\nquality may mask more fundamental\nconcerns about professional status,\nautonomy, and expertise. There are real\nfears of dilution of expertise among\nhealth professionals. Specialisation is\nseen as a key to advancement and,\nparticularly among GUM physicians,\nthere are anxieties that career progres-\nsion might be slower in an integrated\nservice. Enthusiasm for broadening\nexpertise, then, is by no means univer-\nsal, especially where breadth is per-\nceived to be achieved at the cost of\ndepth. For many GUM practitioners,\ntheir specialism is the single most\nattractive feature of their employment.\nThese more intractable aspects of the\ndivide between family planning and\nGUM, as traditionally practised, clearly\nneed to be addressed in training pro-\ngrammes. This problem may have been\nworse in the past when the gulf between\nthe two specialties appeared wider.\nChange is likely to occur naturally\nthrough the upcoming stream of\nyounger recruits. Indeed, a degree of\nintegration may be inevitable precisely\nbecause of changes in medical education\nand training which are already in place.\nWider opportunities are now available\nto younger doctors. The introduction of\nthe Faculty of Family Planning and\nReproductive Health Care (FFPRHC)\nwas pivotal to the major changes in\nthe family planning specialty, particu-\nlarly with respect to having a more\nstructured career ladder. This has the\npotential to encourage younger doctors\nto see family planning in terms of a\ncareer option. Many GUM physicians\nhave now had formal training in family\nplanning and many are members of the\nRoyal College of Obstetricians and\nGynaecologists,21 and GUM trainees are\nrequired to obtain the DFFP.22\nSignificant modules in GUM are\nincluded in community gynaecology.22\nOpportunities for professional develop-\nment are also increasing. Family plan-\nning doctors making the transition to\nmore holistic services are able to attend\nDiploma courses in GUM, nurses the\nEnglish National Board course in GUM\nand FP.23\nAdditionally there is now increasing\ncooperative training being developed\naround the United Kingdom with, for\nexample, study units on sexual health\nbeing offered in some universities. There\nis also joint working between the\nFFPRHC and MSSVD such that DFFP\nand sexually transmitted infection foun-\ndation (STIF) courses are increasingly\nbeing run in conjunction with one\nanother.\nDespite moves in the right direction,\nthere remains a need for shared basic\nlevel training for GUM and family\nplanning practitioners. However facil-\nitative the provision of integrated ser-\nvices, the personal perspectives of those\nworking in each of the specialties will be\nimportant in determining their success.\nTraining may not solve all problems\nassociated with service integration, but\nit is likely to be an important determi-\nnant, not merely of the comprehensive-\nness of service provision, but also of the\ncohesiveness of the profession.\nSex Transm Infect 2003;79:354\u2013356\nAuthors\u2019 affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nR Kane, K Wellings, Centre for Sexual and\nReproductive Health Research, Department of\nPublic Health and Policy, London School of\nHygiene and Tropical Medicine, London\nWC1E 7HT, UK\nCorrespondence to: Roslyn Kane, Centre for\nSexual and Reproductive Health Research,\nDepartment of Public Health and Policy, London\nSchool of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,\nLondon WC1E 7HT, UK;\nRoslyn.kane@lshtm.ac.uk\nREFERENCES\n1 Fox LJ, Williamson NE, et al.

There is\nusually a trade off between the two. For\na screening test the priority is usually to\nidentify all those with early or asympto-\nmatic disease at the expense of includ-\ning some false positives. This way those\nwith a negative screening test can be\ntold with some confidence that they are\nnot affected, and those who screen\npositive can be further investigated\nthrough a diagnostic test with higher\nsensitivity to exclude the false positives.\nThis traditional teaching relates to pro-\ngrammes to detect early stages of\nchronic disease such as cancers and\ncardiovascular disease.1\nIn STIs, screening has an expanded\nrole. The aim is not only to identify\nindividuals with asymptomatic disease\nin order to treat and reduce sequelae, it\nis also to reduce transmission and\ncontribute to STI control.\nRecent developments in nucleic acid\namplification techniques have revolutio-\nnised diagnostics in, for example, chla-\nmydia screening. These have the\ncapacity to detect tiny numbers of\norganisms using less invasive sampling\ntechniques.2 This has led to an expanded\ngold standard compared with the earlier\nnorm of culture, making older tests\nappear even less sensitive in compar-\nison. There is pressure to base any\nexpanded screening programme on the\nmost sensitive tests available.\nHowever, effectiveness of a screening\nprogramme is not based only upon the\nvalidity of individual results. It is also\nbased on the coverage of the relevant\npopulation and on the ability to rapidly\nand effectively treat those who are\ninfected in order to break the chain of\ntransmission. One strategy for doing\nthis is to develop tests that can be\ncarried out rapidly with results given\nto the patient at the same consultation.\nThere have been major advances in the\npast decade in developing such point of\ncare (POC) tests, but almost invariably\nthey have a lower sensitivity than the\never expanding gold standard. This\nmeans that many programme managers\ndismiss POC tests as inappropriate. This\nmay be short sighted. Using tests that\nrequire laboratory support usually\nmeans that patients have to return for\ntheir results, introducing a delay of\n1\u20132 weeks before treatment can be\ninitiated allowing time for further trans-\nmission. In addition, some patients\nremain untreated as they do not return\nand cannot be traced. A test with\nan immediate result would overcome\nthese two problems. This has been\ncalled the rapid test paradox, in which\na lower rate of detection leads to more\ncases being treated.3 Screening for an\ninfectious agent can thus be thought\nof as similar to vaccine programmes,\nwhere population immunity is a key\nfactor in addition to individual vaccine\nefficacy.\nIn STIs screening has an expanded\nrole\u2026to reduce transmission and\ncontribute to STI control\nIn a very useful contribution to this\ndebate in this issue of STI, Vickerman\nand colleagues (p 363) report results of\na modelling exercise to look at the\nsensitivity requirements of POC tests in\nrelation to their potential impact on STI\ncontrol.4 They use data from various\npopulations in Africa and in the United\nKingdom to inform the model, and\nshow that a test with a relatively low\nsensitivity can still make a significant\ncontribution to STI control in situations\nwhere, for example, only 80% of women\nreturn for treatment and 50% of those\ninfected transmit to a partner during the\ntreatment delay.\nThe authors are particularly interested\nin the implications for STI control in\nresource poor settings, where laboratory\nfacilities are limited and cheap POC\ntests could be a useful addition to the\nlimitations of current syndromic manage-\nment approaches. But this should not\nbe dismissed as irrelevant for wealthier\ncountries with good laboratory facilities.\nIn a recent study of opportunistic\nchlamydia screening in young people\nin London, with a prevalence of 10.6%,\nonly 76% of those with a positive or\nequivocal result returned for treatment.5\n356 EDITORIALS\nwww.stijournal.com\n on 18 January 2006 sti.bmjjournals.comDownloaded from \nIn mobile and hard to reach groups\nsuch as tourists, sex workers, and\nrefugees there would be added advan-\ntages to using rapid tests. Less is known\nabout whether a test with immediate\nresults would be more acceptable to\nthose who are being screened, but given\nthe increasing popularity of instant\naccess to information and services, it\nseems likely to have a widespread\nappeal.\nOnce again in the field of STI control\nwe may be facing a conflict between the\npopulation or public health perspective,\nwhere coverage and rapid treatment is\nthe key, and the individual or clinical\nperspective, where a high level of\nvalidity is paramount.\nSex Transm Infect 2003;79:356\u2013357\nAuthors\u2019 affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nH Ward, Department of Epidemiology and\nPublic Health, Imperial College London, UK\nJ Weber, Department Genitourinary Medicine\nand Communicable Diseases, Imperial College\nLondon, UK\nCorrespondence to: Helen Ward, Department\nof Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial\nCollege London, St Mary\u2019s Campus, Norfolk\nPlace, London W2 1PG, UK;\nh.ward@imperial.ac.uk\nREFERENCES\n1 Beaglehole R, Bonita R, Kjellstrom T.
