It is an intrinsic feature of a world structured by digital and \nmechanical reproduction. However, what has been visible over the last few years in Britain is a modulation of \nrepresentations of celebrity figures in entertainment and news media through reality TV series, newspapers and \ngossip magazines. In a somewhat cynical turn, certain celebrities have been depicted increasingly as \nexploitative, aspirational parvenus whose public performances we should respond to not with desire, admiration \nor benign interest, but rather with a pleasurable blend of contempt, envy, scepticism and prurience. This shift of \nrepresentational emphasis involves the oppressive and punitive foregrounding of class, whereby selected \ncelebrities are understood to be ineluctably anchored to an essential class identity regardless of the extent to \nwhich their social and financial circumstances have been transformed as a result of their conspicuousness or \nnotoriety. \n \nIn this article, we argue that celebrity is an increasingly significant means by which reactionary class attitudes, \nallegiances and judgements are communicated. In contradistinction to claims that the concept of social class has \nlost its analytic value in the context of contemporary consumer society with the growing ideological purchase of \nmeritocracy and choice, we contend that class remains central to the constitution and meaning of celebrity. A \ncentral premise of this article is that celebrity culture is not only thoroughly embedded in everyday social \npractices but is more radically constitutive of contemporary social life. We examine this claim through a \nconsideration of the ways in which celebrity produces and sustains class relations. Until recently social class has \nbeen marginal to scholarly accounts of the social phenomenon of celebrity. However, recent work on reality \ntelevision, notably that of Bev Skeggs and Helen Wood (2008), Su Holmes (2003) Gareth Palmer (2004) Anita \nBiressi and Heather Nunn (2005) and Irmi Karl (2007), suggests that class is re-emerging as an important \nanalytic frame within Media and Cultural Studies. Taking its lead from this scholarship this article explores the \nstructural inequalities of contemporary fame. Celebrity, \u2017the condition of being talked about\u2018, is understood \nherein as a distinctly disciplinary sphere of social life, a class pantomime through which the establishment of \nsocial hierarchies and processes of social abjection (qua punishment for sexual and social transgression) are \nacted out figuratively (Little et al, 1973). We argue that a new category of notoriety or public visibility has \nemerged and is embodied in the figure of the working-class female celebrity, who operates as what Skeggs \nterms the \u2017constitutive limit to propriety\u2018 within celebrity culture and wider social life (2005: 968). \n \nThe first part of this article challenges claims that the putative dominance of celebrity represents the \u2017dumbing \ndown\u2018 of culture, as well as neo-liberal arguments that celebrity culture is \u2017democratizing\u2018 or symptomatic of \nwider \u2017social levelling\u2018. Rather, celebrity is understood as a hierarchical domain of value formation \n2 \n \ncharacterized by struggles over the social worth and meaning of selected classed, gendered and racialized \nbodies. The second part of this article refers to a range of news and entertainment media, including blogs and \nonline discussion fora, to consider how \u2017celebrity chavs\u2018 are systematically reproduced as abject, gauche, \nexcessive tragi-comic figures. In the conclusion we argue that these figures frequently migrate beyond \nnewspaper gossip columns and celebrity magazines to a wide array of social spaces, where they are a means of \nmaintaining class and gender distinctions so that, for example, celebrity chavs are cited as evidence of the moral \ndelinquency of white working-class girls. \n \nCelebrity Culture \nCelebrity culture is disseminated across such a broad range of media and communication forms that its \nboundaries are difficult to delimit; as Su Holmes notes, celebrity \u2017saturates the \u2015everyday\u2016\u2018 (2005: 24). In \naddition to a wide range of celebrity-oriented commercial and promotional media, celebrity culture is also \nproduced and sustained by a range of public institutions and leisure industries. All of these interests promote, \nmanufacture, trade in and profit from celebrity, and the celebrity branding of consumer goods has deployed \ncelebrities in every quarter of consumer culture. Journalistic commentary and celebrity gossip extend these \npersonae into everyday social exchanges and practices, and whilst financial gain is clearly a key function of \ncelebrity for those who stand to profit (including celebrities themselves), to understand the impact and \nsignificance of celebrity culture we must think beyond the restricted financial exchange value of celebrity. We \nneed an expanded understanding of \u2017the economic\u2018 to understand the increasing visibility of celebrity within \neveryday life. \n \nOver the last decade British sociologists have powerfully reformulated our comprehension of the dynamics of \nsocial class. Influenced by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, feminist sociologists, such as Skeggs, \nStephanie Lawler, Diane Reay, Valerie Hey and Valerie Walkerdine, have demonstrated how social class cannot \nbe understood in terms of economic capital alone. One of Bourdieu\u2018s central contributions to class scholarship \nwas to establish the role of non- or indirectly economic factors, such as \u2017symbolic capital\u2018 (status, reputation, the \nright to be listened to) and \u2017cultural capital\u2018 (education, competencies, skills, taste), in generating and \nmaintaining class distinctions and correlatively in enabling or obstructing social mobility. As Lawler suggests, \nfor instance, one way in which class inequality is reproduced is through processes of \u2017making working-class \nsubjectivities pathological, so that class relations are not just economic relations but also relations of \nsuperiority\/inferiority, normality\/abnormality, judgment\/shame\u2018 (1999:4). This classification process is central \nto celebrity culture. Fascination with celebrities\u2018 social class is evident in discussion about the \u2017backgrounds\u2018 of \nfamous men and women, the proliferation of celebrity biographies and autobiographies, and the close scrutiny of \nthe deportment and discrimination of individual celebrities. Systematized through an expanding taxonomy (A-\nlist, B-list, Z-list), it is important to note that this classification process operates unequally along gender lines, \nwith male celebrities less exposed to the inquisitive attention directed at women, and more able to ascend the \nscale of celebrity value. Despite this incessant emphasis on class within celebrity media, few academic accounts \nof celebrity culture have undertaken a class-focused analysis or considered the increasingly central function \ncelebrity plays within wider social processes of class-making. Whilst scholarly work on fan cultures and \n3 \n \nstardom has always paid some attention to class and economic inequality, the construction of celebrity within \neveryday communication practices and entertainment media is clearly distinct from conventional expressions of \nfandom in its ambivalence towards its object. For instance, many of the social networking sites, blogs and \ndiscussion groups devoted to the analysis of celebrity behaviour, express intense, hyperbolic hatred and aversion \nrather than love or admiration. Hatred can be a community-forming attachment to a \u2017bad object\u2018; however, it is \nnot the mode of identification we normally associate with \u2017fandom\u2018, but rather a perverse, if equally fanatical, \n\u2017anti-fandom\u2018.  \n \nCelebrity Scholarship \nJessica Evans (2007) argues that two central arguments about the classed meanings of celebrity circulate within \nMedia and Cultural studies. The first, made by Daniel Boorstin in 1961, is that celebrity culture epitomizes the \nnarcissism and superficiality of market-driven society and thereby marks the decline of traditional values and \ninstitutions (the atomization of family and community, the spread of secularism and aesthetic relativism). The \nrise of celebrity culture is often cited as indisputable evidence of the \u2017dumbing down\u2018 or decadence of public \nculture, particularly across mainstream entertainment media but also in such domains as education and \nparliamentary politics. Recent comments by British broadcaster Sir David Attenborough about developments at \nthe BBC, exemplify this view: \u2017It\u2018s all about celebrity, which is a disaster; it's ghastly. The celebrity cult means \nyou are famous without talent [\u2026] Popularism has pervaded our society. It is a distorted form of democracy and \negalitarianism\u2018 (Pierce, 2008). The ascendancy of this debased, commercialized culture is typically understood \nas a deeply uncritical populism that masquerades as democracy but which, in fact, represents the erosion of \nsocial and cultural values by the market. This argument perhaps relies on a questionable celebration of high \nculture, but nevertheless Attenborough\u2018s complaint recognizes that the celebrity culture industries do promote \nfantasies of participatory democracy. Claims about the inclusive, emancipatory effects of contemporary \ncelebrity culture should be examined carefully and contested.  \n \nA second key argument is, indeed, that the rise of celebrity culture, and the supposed demise of hierarchical, \n\u00e9litist systems of fame and public visibility, demonstrates the democratization of public life. In such accounts, \ncelebrity culture, understood as a recent phenomenon, is offered as evidence of wider processes of social \nlevelling (see Evans, 2007: 14). Claims that celebrity culture is democratic hinge on two premises; the first is \nthat the visibility of members of \u2017marginal\u2018 groups demonstrates that celebrity culture creates \u2017employment \nopportunities\u2018 for social groups that were previously socially and culturally disenfranchised. The increased \nvisibility of (unpaid or low paid) working-class people and members of ethnic minority groups on television has \nled many to concur. Sociologist Joshua Gamson, for example, has suggested \u2017celebrity is a primary \ncontemporary means to power, privilege, and mobility\u2018 (1994: 186). While perhaps true for some individuals, it \nremains the case that groups historically marginalized from media production, are evidentially not producing \nmainstream content. Empirical research suggests that the media industry is growing more, not less, exclusive in \nits employment practices.\ni\n Graeme Turner observes that, on the face of it, celebrity culture appears to have \n\u2017opened up media access to women, to people of colour and to a wider array of class positions; there is every \nreason why the positive by-products of this increased volume and diversity might excite optimism about its \ndemocratic potential\u2018 (2006:157). However, he cautions that these effects are accidental and that \u2017It is important \n4 \n \nto remember that celebrity still remains a systematically hierarchical and exclusive category, no matter how \nmuch it proliferates\u2018 (Ibid.). It is certainly questionable whether the appearance of a more diverse range of \nfigures on television (as presenters, interviewees, documentary subjects, game-show contestants and fictional \ncharacters) is an indication of their greater editorial control over the manipulation and presentation of those \nappearances, much less wider access to the means of production and distribution of television content. As \nBiressi and Nunn (2005), Holmes (2003), and Skeggs and Wood (2008) have all argued, this democratizing \nargument is frequently used by media producers as a cynical defence against accusations that those reality genre \nprogrammes that are complicit with the phenomenon of celebrity culture exploit their unwitting subjects. \n \nThe second source of evidence cited in defence of celebrity culture\u2018s democratic potential is the increase of \n\u2017participatory opportunities\u2018 for commentary by media audiences such as the widespread use of phone and \nonline voting in game-shows and TV news, and the opportunity for \u2017feedback\u2018 via online forums and video file-\nsharing sites like YouTube. John Hartley has optimistically named this fusion of democratic forms with \nentertainment media \u2017democratainment\u2018, although again it is unclear to what extent the opportunity to publish \ncommentary about media content is emancipatory or critically effective (1999). A survey of the letters pages of \nnewspapers and magazines, online entertainment blogs and discussion groups, suggests that the opportunity to \nexpress an opinion publicly is unlikely to produce oppositional or critically reflective interpretations of celebrity \nmedia. More often than not it is taken as a chance to participate in consolidation of the dominant meanings of a \ncelebrity, already encoded within celebrity media. In other words, the democratizing claim risks becoming \nindistinct from neo-liberal ideologies of market meritocracy, which use the rhetoric of \u2017equality of opportunity\u2018 \nto disguise and sustain massive inequality. \n \nIn debates about the value and meaning of celebrity culture, class is frequently encoded euphemistically through \nreferences to \u2017ordinary\u2018 or \u2017real people\u2018 (Blacker, 2008). The term \u2017ordinary\u2018 here generally retains disparaging \nconnotations: \u2017often depreciatory: common-place, somewhat inferior. Not distinguished by rank or position, of \nlow degree: common, vulgar, unrefined\u2018 (Little et al. 1973:1461). Arguing that progressive changes within the \nclass constitution of celebrity are related to media change, Turner comments that there has been \u2017a \nprogrammatic shift in the preferred territory for the development of celebrity in particular media platforms \u2013 \ntelevision and the internet in particular. This is a shift from the \u00e9lite to the ordinary\u2018 (2006: 154). However, this \nis no simple movement of levelling and the category of the \u2017ordinary\u2018 retains its negative sense. As Skeggs \nobserves, class is rarely named directly but, rather, is connoted `through moral euphemism`, whereby processes \nof interpretation `do the work of association` (2005: 965, see also Bromley 2000). Moral euphemism is thus one \nmeans by which the class identities of individual public figures are signalled, although, in the case of celebrity \nchavs, class judgements are increasingly explicit. In the last decade in Britain, the contemptuous term \u2017Chav\u2018 \nhas become widely used to describe young, white, working-class men and women as shiftless, tasteless, \nunintelligent, immoral or criminal. The celebrity chav is a figure who has become rapidly and unexpectedly \nwealthy or publicly visible \u2013 typically through reality television - and is represented as constitutionally unable to \nmanage this change of circumstance with dignity, sangfroid or prudence. Oxymoronic in terms of an \nincreasingly hierarchized celebrity culture, the celebrity chav is the excessive embodiment of class hatred. \n5 \n \n \nCelebrity as Class Pantomime \nCelebrity is a form of improvisatory, excessive, public theatre. It is class pantomime and the \u2017chav\u2018, a vicious \nand grotesque representation of the undeserving poor, is a stock character\nii\n. Despite its apparent unpredictability \n(through regular expos\u00e9s, scandals and embarrassments), celebrity culture has a highly formal structure with \ncoherent, bounded narratives that permit and contain extemporization by a cast of recognizable social types. \nVulgarity is a predominant theme and a central spectatorial pleasure of this bawdy theatre is that it enables \naudiences to experience and reassert class difference: to affirm, \u2017I am not that\u2019. As celebrity journalist Polly \nHudson writes, the reason \u2017we can't get enough of The Goody and Katona shows, is simply - even though it's \nuncomfortable to admit - because they make us feel better about ourselves\u2018 (2008). Such media engagement is \nnot merely directed towards the pleasures of a comparative sense of self-worth. It also serves to reinforce the \nunderstanding that \u2017we\u2018, the audience, occupy a secure position from which to make evaluative assessments of \nthe inferior class status of others (see Skeggs, 2005: 977). As Carole Anne Tyler notes, \u2017to have class is to be at \na controlling distance from what signifies its lack\u2018 (2002: 53). \n \nCriminologist Ruth Penfold suggests that celebrity can be understood as a rather more violent, punitive mode of \nspeactacular performance, a public ritual analogous to \u2017a penal system\u2018 (Penfold, 2004; see also Palmer 2003). \nThe apparently insatiable desire for celebrity gossip and scandal arguably demands increasingly cruel dramas \nthat recall Michel Foucault\u2018s account of the \u2017theatres of punishment\u2018 (such as the scaffold, the chain-gang and \npublic torture) of earlier historical periods (1977). Participation, and the sense of belonging to a community of \nviewers and readers, is central to celebrity culture, whether through the physical presence of members of a \nstudio audience, or through remote and virtual forms of participation. This is scarcely evidence of democratic \naccountability and, if we extend the Foucauldian analogy further, we can understand contemporary audiences as \nperforming a role similar to that of \u2017the baying mob\u2018. As Foucault suggests, the mob was not \u2017free\u2018 or self-\norganizing, but directed and coerced by public officials to \u2017participate\u2018 in torture and executions. This historical \ncomparison is not so unimaginable if we picture the over-excited, jeering crowds who watch the weekly \n\u2017eviction\u2018 of competitors in the Big Brother game-show from the programme\u2018s set. Affective \u2017audience \nparticipation\u2018 is integral to such programmes, and responses of \u2017moral outrage\u2018 are a crucial component of \nspectatorial engagement. Indeed, the entertainment derived from celebrity lies in the opportunity to participate \nin the humiliation and debasement of its `actors\u2018. \n \nCelebrity Femininity \nCiting Kathleen Hall Jamieson\u2018s study of the history of public speech, Liesbet van Zoonen argues that women \nhave historically been excluded from achieving fame because of their position as `private persons` and the \n`vigorous restrictions\u2018 this imposed on their speech. As Jamieson notes, \u2017Long after ducking stools and gossip \nbridles had become curiosities in museums, the silence they enforced and the warnings they imposed continued \nto haunt women\u2018 (Jamieson, 1988: 68 in van Zoonen). Van Zoonen suggests that a shift from an economy of \nfame (inaccessible to women by virtue of its emphasis on heroic masculine attributes and public speaking) to a \nculture of celebrity (in which fame depends less on certain forms of achievement and public speech and more on \n6 \n \nattributes such as appearance) privileges \u2017femininity\u2018. However, as van Zoonen suggests, celebrity is restricted \nto those who can display femininities of highly specific kinds. The forms of celebrity available to women are, \nlike the concomitant forms of femininity, regulated and relentlessly disciplined. The archaic \u2017ducking stool\u2018 is, \nthus, one of the central organizing principles of celebrity culture. \n \nFemininity has never been easily accessible to working-class women. As Skeggs suggests, `Both black and \nwhite working-class women` have historically been coded `as the sexual and deviant other against which \nfemininity [is] defined\u2018 (2001: 297). It is precisely because femininity is associated with the middle and upper \nclasses that working-class women imagine that acquisition of the correct femininity is a central means of \nacquiring cultural capital and social mobility. However, while femininity is often employed by working-class \nwomen as a way of `deflecting associations of pathology, poverty, and pollution`, their attempts to \u2017do \nfemininity\u2018 are often read as a class drag act, an unconvincing and inadvertently parodic attempt to pass \n(Skeggs 2001:298). A defining feature of celebrity chavs is an inability to perform femininity correctly. Indeed, \nthese celebrities are subject to invasive levels of public surveillance in which the slightest \u2017error\u2018 in appearance \nor speech can expose them to negative class judgements. Carole Anne Tyler observes that `a real woman is a \nreal lady; otherwise, she is a female impersonator, whose \"unnaturally bad\" taste \u2014 like that attributed to \nworking-class women or women of colour - marks the impersonation of such\u2018 (2001: 61) Chav celebrity is \nconstituted by this incompetent or unsuccessful impersonation, and the exposure of this failure is a key source of \npleasure in celebrity culture. \n \nSome of the most withering examples of this ritual of \u2017class outing\u2018 in British publications are found in the \nextensive commentary on Coleen McLoughlin, wife of British professional footballer Wayne Rooney. For \nexample, in a Sunday Times profile, entitled \u2017Coleen McLoughlin: Triumph of Teen Spirit and Awful Taste\u2018, an \nanonymous journalist responds scornfully to the news that McLoughlin was to feature in British Vogue, \nunironically described as \u2017the classiest of women\u2018s monthly glossies and trendsetter for high maintenance \nfemales\u2018 (2005). The article states:  \nVogue has never compromised its high standards with plebeian taste. And McLoughlin is to style what \na bicycle repair kit is to a Formula One car. She is a shopaholic whose undiscerning accumulation of \nexpensive clothes \u2014 paid for with Rooney\u2018s gold credit cards \u2014 has earned her the term \u2015looting \nchic\u2016. She is, in short, a \u2015superchav\u2016, the uncrowned queen of chav.[...] A girl of average looks, an \nunremarkable figure and no discernible talent is to have the ultimate self-affirming accolade of being \nshowcased as a style leader in the June issue of Vogue. (2005) \nAccounts of the white poor have always foregrounded physical appearance, tending to emphasize a perceived \nincontinence and excess of (bodily) materiality. Indeed, newspaper accounts of \u2017chavs\u2018 (UK) and \u2017white trash\u2018 \n(USA) vividly recall Victorian and Edwardian accounts of the dangerous, libidinal lower classes: the great \nunwashed (Tyler, 2008). Nevertheless, the venomous class semantics of this article about McLoughlin are worth \nreiterating. It reminds us that McLoughlin is an arriviste, brought up on the `grim Croxteth estate` in Liverpool, \nand employs a rich lexicon to signify her as pathologically working class: plebeian, rough, grasping, \n7 \n \nuneducated, care-work, cleaners, prostitutes and brothels, slappers, drunken brawls, screaming abuse, fists and \nfeet and domestic violence. Whilst the mockery and derision of many marginal and disadvantaged groups is \nwidely considered to be in \u2017bad taste\u2018 in mainstream public culture, such a caricature remains acceptable in \nBritish newspapers. McLoughlin is a public figure who strives to increase her cultural capital and acquire \u2017class\u2018 \nthrough charity work and the presentation of herself as educated and thoroughly respectable. However, the \nsneering press coverage of her 2008 wedding to Rooney suggests such attempts are futile. As Marina Hyde \ncommented in The Guardian: \nIf you had the remotest doubt that snobbery is thriving in this country, it must have been erased by the \nspectacle of sections of the media reminding the most talented footballer in the country of his place, \nand that of his family. \"It's a long way from Croxteth,\" they tittered, while \"a source\" confided to the \nMail that \"Coleen was told in no uncertain terms that guests should look like they were at a top \nwedding. The [OK!] magazine bosses were terrified they would turn up looking too chavvy.\"[...] What \nreally lies beneath, of course, is a gibbering terror of social mobility (2008). \nIn contrast to McLoughlin\u2018s desire to \u2017better herself\u2018 through the emulation or adoption of middle-class habitus, \nother celebrity chavs trade more forthrightly on their pathological working-class personae, their primary value in \nthe celebrity market place.  \nKerry Katona \nKerry Katona\u2018s frequently cited \u2017celebrity biography\u2018 always includes the following information: Born in 1980 \nin Warrington, a large post-industrial town in North West England, Katona was brought up by an alcoholic, \nabusive and suicidal mother and never knew her biological father. She spent periods of her childhood in care \nhomes or with foster parents and at 16 embarked on a career as a lap-dancer, stripper, glamour model, touring \nwith a dance troupe before acquiring minor celebrity singing in the pop group Atomic Kitten (1999-2001). Her \n2002 marriage to a fellow pop star, Westlife singer Brian McFadden, was headline news. After becoming a \nmother Katona moved into television, appearing on and presenting daytime magazine programmes and her \ncelebrity profile dipped. However, when she won the 2004 British series of reality TV game-show I'm a \nCelebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, Katona was thrust back into the celebrity spotlight. Media coverage from this \nperiod constructs her as an archetypal \u2017ordinary celebrity\u2018, the working-class girl \u2017done good\u2018.  \nAs the show\u2018s winner, Katona\u2018s \u2017coronation\u2018 as \u2017Queen of the Jungle\u2018 was a high-profile media event that \nextended beyond the TV programme itself. In an inversion of the normal dictates of neoliberal girlhood, \nKatona\u2018s lack of education, bourgeois graces and proper speech, her vulgarity, na\u00efvet\u00e9, and bodily excess were \nvery briefly granted positive value. Indeed, the figuration of Katona in this period can be read as a contemporary \nexample of what Mikhail Bakhtin (1941) termed \u2017the carnivalesque\u2018: a ritualized interval in which class \nhierarchies are temporarily reversed and an anti-classical counter-aesthetic briefly emerges. Inevitably, though, \nthere is scant liberatory potential in this over-turning of the normal hierarchies of femininity and class, for what \nultimately makes figures such as Katona highly marketable is their signification of class otherness. Katona\u2018s \ncelebrity was initially assembled around a grounded, respectable working-class character marked by tenacity \n8 \n \nand lack of pretention. This image of virtuous ordinariness was carefully developed within the framework of a \n\u2018rags-to-riches\u2018 narrative employed both by British journalists and Katona herself. For example, her best-selling \nghost-written autobiography, Kerry Katona: Too Much Too Soon - My Story of Love, Survival and Celebrity \n(2006), details her harrowing, impoverished upbringing and rise to fame, whilst her novel, Tough Love (2007) \nextends this \u2017working-class heroine\u2018 persona into a fully fictional account of a successful glamour model. In a \nknowing echo of Katona\u2018s own \u2017return\u2018 to her roots, the protagonist, Leanne Crompton, loses her job and is \nforced to leave London returning to her previous life with her chaotic, violent working-class family in the North \nof England.  \n \nThis carefully managed persona was quickly supplanted by storylines in the press documenting her excessive \nbehaviour and, crucially, her failure as a mother. In 2005 Katona starred in a television show, My Fair Kerry \n(ITV), which, as the title suggests, parodies the scenario of George Bernard Shaw\u2018s Pygmalion (1913) and its \nmusical adaptation, My Fair Lady. However, rather than an acerbic attack on the British class system, My Fair \nKerry is pure class pantomime. The promotional press release revealed that Katona would attempt \u2017to turn \nherself into a high society princess in just two weeks\u2018, leaving \u2017her Warrington home for a fairytale castle in \nAustria\u2018, to be tutored by etiquette coaches in \u2017deportment and speech\u2018 and \u2017proper table manners\u2018. Katona \nspeculates gamely in the press release, \u2017It might be a new me when I finish [\u2026] You might never see the \ncommon Kerry again. This could be a new start, a new voice, a new way of sitting!\u2018 (ITV, 2005) Much of the \ncomedy derives from the contrast between two different class stereotypes, embodied by Austrian aristocrats and \nKatona and her family, and from the audience\u2018s recognition that the acculturation and disciplining of Katona is \ndoomed to fail, precisely because her class identity is an essential, inescapable element of her celebrity persona.  \nMy Fair Kerry derives from the sub-genre of \u2017make-over\u2018 reality programmes and gameshows, such as Faking \nIt (Channel 4, 2001-6), Strictly Come Dancing (2004-7, BBC), and Ladette to Lady (ITV, 2005-8), the latter of \nwhich set out to transform `some of Britain\u2018s most extreme binge-drinking, sexually shameless, anti-social \nrebels into respectable ladies \u2017 (ITV). These programmes explore the contingency of existing social relations, \nand their investment in appearance, by dramatizing individuals\u2018 attempts to induce misrecognition, but all the \nsame our engagement stems from the improbability that the incorrigible contestants will be able to pass \nsuccessfully in an unfamiliar role. As Carole Anne Tyler notes in another context, \u2017passing can only name the \nvery failure of passing, an indication of a certain impossibility at its heart, of the contradictions which constitute \nit\u2018 (1994: 212). In this respect, My Fair Kerry is less about passing than class drag, as Katona is required to act \nout in an exaggerated fashion what are imagined to be the bodily dispositions of a white working-class woman, \ndisplaying an excessive and incontinent combination of na\u00efvet\u00e9, ignorance, playfulness, unruliness and \nvulgarity. The effects of this performance on the audience are the only unpredictable element within this \nscenario.  \nCelebrity is a contested domain of value-formation. There is no single public response to figures like Katona \nsince they are a site of struggle over the meaning of class among other things. This struggle is epitomized by the \nambivalence evident in newspaper accounts of the recent death of Jade Goody, many of which were concerned \n9 \n \nwith reviewing the media coverage of her career\niii\n. If My Fair Kelly directs its audience towards a reading of \nKatona as irredeemably unrespectable, the audience members negotiate this reading in the context of their own \nsocial positioning. For some viewers, Katona\u2018s performance in My Fair Kerry, and her resistance to grooming \nmay reinforce her authenticity as a \u2017real\u2018 working-class girl who is therefore an object of identification, while \nfor others she remains contemptibly common. While David Morley (1980) has argued that the heterogeneous \nsocial composition of media audiences potentially opens up a range of readings and decoding strategies, positive \nand even defiant readings of Katona are nevertheless hard to sustain in the face of the \u2017scandalous\u2018 press reports \nthat continually envelop her. So closely identified with indignity is she that any veneer of respectability has been \nprised away.  \nThe virulent disparagement of Katona in the press and online entertainment news forums and blogs, can be read \nas part of what Tyler has identified as an intensification of \u2017hate speech\u2018 against the white poor in the last \ndecade (2008). Katona\u2018s perceived lack of cultural capital helped propel her career as a celebrity, but this \n`ordinariness` also constrains her ability to capitalize on her fame and \u2017trade-up\u2018 her celebrity status. Katona is \none of a number of working-class female celebrities to trace this narrative arc. Initially admired for their \n\u2017authenticity\u2018, they rapidly become \u2017objects in a plot in which the only position for them to occupy is one of \npathology\u2018 (Lawler,1999:15). Those managing Katona\u2018s celebrity persona have, of course, capitalized on the \nmoral outrage generated by regular press releases and news stories about her bad behaviour. As a passage in \nTough Love observes:  \nLisa didn\u2018t mind reading about Leanne when it was bad news. In fact she enjoyed it [\u2026] The \nmagazines were talking about it being the end of her. But Lisa knew that if Leanne was smart it could \nbe the making of her. She could turn her hard-luck story into a lucrative rags-to-riches, riches-to-rags \nstory (2007: 17).  \nThe \u2017fly-on-the-wall\u2018 documentary series, Kerry Katona: Crazy in Love (MTV, 2007-8), is just such an attempt \nto exploit her status as celebrity chav. Steph Lawler identifies the three main axes around which working class \nwomen are characterized as abject thus: `their bodily appearance (assumed to mark a deeper, pathologized, \npsychology); their ignorance or lack of understanding; and their inadequacy as mothers` (2004 115). These three \nvectors of \u2017deficiency\u2018 trace precisely the semantics of Katona\u2018s celebrity in Crazy in Love in which she is \ndepicted as an unhappy, slovenly mother barely hanging onto her sanity. Adopting a reality TV format in its \ndocumentation of the mundane, domestic intimacies of its subjects\u2018 lives, Crazy in Love recounts Katona\u2018s \nrelationship with new husband Mark Croft (always described as an \u2017ex-cabbie\u2018, and widely reviled) and her four \nchildren. The series also details the celebrity activities that occupy Katona, such as photoshoots, TV chatshow \nappearances, performance in a feature film, consultation over the development of a range of perfumes, and \nregular meetings with famous publicist Max Clifford. \n10 \n \n \nFigure 1: \u2018Kerry Katona: Crazy in Love, Catharine Street\u2019, William Fallows, 2007 (Courtesy William Fallows). \nThe image used to publicize the series pictures Katona and her husband wearing straightjackets, bound together \nin a literal rendering of the series title (see fig. 1). The image refers to Katona\u2018s well-documented \u2017bi-polar\u2018 \ndisorder and periods in rehabilitation for drug and alcohol abuse, and also foregrounds her pregnant body which \nappears to be \u2017bursting out\u2018 of the jacket. This body is thus rendered as `a body beyond governance\u2018 (Skeggs,  \n2005: 965). The image also emphasizes Katona\u2018s large breasts, which are a key signifier of working-class \nfemale celebrity, associated with glamour modelling and pornography, especially when surgically enhanced. As \nShane Watson suggests bluntly in The Sunday Times: \nAs class indicators go, you can't beat a pair of breasts. Accent used to be the big one, but that's no \nlonger foolproof [\u2026] Wardrobe was also once a reliable gauge of provenance, but that has ended \nwhen glam trash became the preferred look for everyone from Posh Spice to Liz Hurley. Run \nthrough the old standard tests\u2014manners, postcode, lifestyle choices, bidets\u2014and you realize that, \nthese days, none of them is anywhere near as revealing as breasts. The size and shapes of boobs are \nsure-fire ways of placing someone on the social spectrum (2006:58 in Karl 2007). \nFrequently condemned as a \u2017bad mother\u2018, and for having too many children, Katona is excessively reproductive, \nas her body attests, and the theme of irresponsible maternity is developed across various episodes of Crazy in \nLove that show the pregnant Katona modelling for a semi-nude photo-shoot, and smoking and drinking before \ngiving birth to her fourth child. She is portrayed as, by turns, infantile and demanding, brash, tasteless, \noutrageous, and distraught, and the structure of the episodes emphasizes her instability. Edited discontinuously, \n11 \n \nthe programmes radically condense, reassemble and possibly reorder conversations and events into montages of \nsignificant shots and discrete statements or punchlines, with reaction shots inserted to provide an ironic frame, \nsuch as a repeated cutaway from Katona\u2018s conversations or behaviour to the family dog watching events in \napparent bemusement. Pop music is used throughout as a means of bridging between scenes and disguising \ntemporal discontinuities, and also as implictly ironic commentary upon the images and events we see. \nAlthough the series might be classed as documentary it eschews the ethical care traditionally taken by \ndocumentarists to represent their subjects with respect. The film-makers remain off-camera and exchanges \nbetween the subjects and the crew are almost entirely edited out to leave the impression of an objective, \nobservational account. The mechanics of staging are carefully disguised.  Furthermore, the manipulation of the \nresulting programmes betrays a deeply judgemental or supercilious attitude towards the subjects. The constant \nimpression is that Katona and her family lack self-awareness; they are dupes who do not understand or have \nmisjudged how their seemingly unguarded exchanges will appear when edited and narrativized for television. \nNor do they appear to grasp the unequal terms of the compact they have entered into with the insouciant \nprogramme-makers who are making entertainment from the exposure of their subjects\u2018 intimate lives and their \nbathetic aspiration to respectability. As a result the dignity of Katona and her companions is repeatedly \nundermined by the structure of the programme. Katona evidently \u2017acts up\u2018 to the cameras, taking on a \npantomime dame-style role of vulgar, bawdy, class other. The role of female celebrity chav hinges on excessive \ncorporeality and the continual exposure of a lack of cultural capital, of style and taste, and she performs this role \nenthusiastically. Whilst the broad quality of her performance suggests calculation and playfulness, which might \nin turn allow a resistant reading of the show, or even the sense that she is a knowing collaborator, this is \nundercut by scenes in which Katona appears intoxicated, exhausted or distressed.  \nCelebrity Chavs \nCelebrity chavs are \u2017repositories of negative value, bad taste\u2018 who offer great entertainment (Skeggs, 2001: \n298). We laugh at their faux-pas and share our disgust at their shameless promiscuity, their tasteless lifestyles, \nparental incompetence and bigotry. Writing about another iconic British celebrity, Rebekah Wade, editor of the \nnewspaper, The Sun, summarizes the logic of these parodic Cinderella narratives, in which a non-descript young \nwoman is transformed into a princess only to be revealed finally as white trash:  \nJade Goody went into the Big Brother house appearing to be simply a fun-loving working-class girl \ncanny enough to have made millions from her 15 minutes of fame. It was all a meticulously \nmanufactured lie. She has left the house with her true personality laid bare - a vile, pig-ignorant, racist \nbully consumed by envy of a woman of superior intelligence, beauty and class (2007).\niv\n \nThe scandal and moral outrage that adheres to these celebrities has an economic function: falling\/failing \ncelebrity extends the transformation narrative and the profitable duration of the celebrity commodity. Moreover, \nthese abject celebrities function to generate celebrity capital for \u2017real\u2018 stars, allowing them to differentiate \nthemselves as comparatively skilled. As performer Rachel Weisz observes, \u2017I am an actress. I think celebrity is a \nvulgar thing. It's so easy to be famous, turn up in a certain frock, present a show, take your top off. [...]. I can't \nstand them\u2018 (Anon, 2007). For figures such as Kerry Katona, their celebrity is not an invitation to aspire to or \n12 \n \nvicariously enjoy a perfect life. Rather, it affords the pleasures of collective engagement with shaming, name-\ncalling and abjection. Chav celebrity owes more to the grotesque spectacles of Bedlam, the freak show and the \npantomime than to the promotional circuits of Hollywood cinema, with the spectacle of these lives offering \naudiences the schadenfreude of what Mick Hume terms \u2017prole porn\u2018, through which `respectable folk can get a \nthrilling glimpse of society's \u2015dark underbelly\u2016`(2008). Critical approaches that conceive of celebrity as rooted \nin positive attachment need to be rethought to account for a growing \u2017celebrity underclass\u2018 of working-class \nwomen whose appeal rests as much in their ability to incite abjection as to inspire identification. \nConclusion \nIn previous work on the figure of the chav, Imogen Tyler explored the ways in which a new vocabulary of social \nclass had emerged in Britain in which the word \u2017chav\u2018 alongside its various synonyms and regional variations, \nhas become a ubiquitous term of abuse for white working-class subjects. She argued that the level of disgust \ndirected at this figure was suggestive of a heightened class antagonism, a class hatred that Julie Burchill has \nprovocatively described as \u2017social racism\u2018 (2005).  One focus for this class hatred is those who are imagined as \nundeserving recipients of wealth, a category that includes benefit recipients and illegal immigrants at one end of \nthe economic scale and celebrities at the other. Extrovert or \u2017showy\u2018 celebrity chavs are perceived as luxuriating \nin \u2017too much\u2018: too much wealth, leisure and pleasure. Media portrayals of these celebrities employ connotations \nof \u2017the undeserving poor\u2018, (representing them as workshy, and uneducated) to generate accounts of \u2017the \nundeserving celebrity\u2018. Rather than protecting them from judgement, the conspicuous and imprudent \nconsumption of these celebrities justifies the hostility with which they are treated. \n \nWhat is interesting about the current production of chav celebrity, and the forms of audience participation it \ncompels, is what is revealed about wider attitudes to social class. As Skeggs suggests, the figure of \u2017the immoral \nrepellent woman is [\u2026] not just a matter of representation\u2018 (2005: 966). For example, the figure of the celebrity \nchav migrates to enable the production of meta-discourses in which claims about the \u2017dumbing down\u2018 of culture, \nand reports about the increasing bad behaviour of celebrities merge in powerful accounts of the rise of a new \ncriminal underclass of young women. As one blogger writes: \nKerry Katona? A talentless piece of trash who's landed 'lucky' [\u2026] quite frankly, I feel the urge to \nvomit at the mere mention of her name. Kerry Katonas are ten a penny-just visit any council estate in \nBritain and you'll find hundreds of them (Anonymized extract from online entertainment blog, 2008). \nThe seamless extrapolation from the figure of Katona to imaginary populations of similarly abject young women \nin council estates across Britain, is indicative of how celebrity chavs can be employed to contribute to wider \nprocesses of social stigmatization and marginalisation. Indeed, alongside scandalous stories of d\u00e9class\u00e9 \ncelebrities, sensational accounts of \u2017violent bad girls\u2018 are proliferating.  \nCriminologist Anne Worrall (2004) has suggested that a new figure, the delinquent \u2017bad girl\u2018, dominates \naccounts of girlhood in Britain. She argues that the perceived rise in \u2017bad behaviour\u2018 amongst young women is \nunderstood not in terms of social exclusion and poverty, but in the terms of an individualized and criminalized \n13 \n \nlanguage of \u2017moral delinquency\u2018. As journalist Paul Bracchii, concludes in a Daily Mail article entitled \u2017The \nFeral Sex: The terrifying rise of violent girl gangs\u2018:  \nWhat's clear is that there has been a dramatic coarsening in the behaviour of an entire underclass of \nyoung women - driven partly by the destruction of the nuclear family and the lack of a strong father \nfigure, but also by a celebrity culture in which female so-called \"stars\" - famous only for appearing on \nBig Brother or its equivalents - are photographed blind drunk and fighting in the gutter with other \nwomen outside nightclubs (2008). \n \nChav celebrities, marketable because they \u2017act badly\u2018, are constructed by the same media conglomerates and \ninstitutions that blame them for producing a generational underclass of morally bankrupt young women. As \nBracchii\u2018s article suggests, the lexicon of ladettes, chavs, binge-drinking, vulgarity, sexual excess and single \nmotherhood predominates in the construction of both celebrity and \u2017real life\u2018 women as \u2017offensive\u2018. Arguably \nthe steady accumulation of representations of the excessive behaviour of white trash celebrities helps enable this \nmoral panic to take hold. Certainly, one consequence of this moral panic is that it feeds back into the political \ndecision-making process, where it is (cynically) mobilized as a means of authorizing \u2017tough\u2018 responses (see \nICAR, 2004: 5). Indeed, as Worrall demonstrates, young women are increasingly criminalized through \nmechanisms such as \u2017Anti-Social Behaviour Orders\u2018. Worrall suggests that a flexible definition of antisocial \nbehaviour means that these court orders can categorize as illegal activities that might previously have been \nviewed as misguided, youthful rebellion (2004: 44).Whilst the relationship between celebrity culture and the \nkinds of class-stereotyping that characterize these moral panics about young women falls beyond the scope of \nthis article, it warrants further exploration.  \n \nAs Toynbee and Walker observe, regardless of the general signs of increasing affluence, in contemporary \nBritain:  \n\u2017Social mobility is barred. Where people are born they are destined to remain, more fixed than even \nthirty years ago, The fifteen-year boom [\u2026] has cemented people more rigidly to their class [\u2026] \nGeneral mobility is a myth\u2018 (Toynbee, Walker, 2008: 9).  \n \nIn this context, the cautionary narrative of the celebrity chav\u2018s progress reminds us of the difficulty and \nundesirability of transgressing class boundaries. What makes figures like Kerry Katona and Jade Goody both \ncomic and poignant is their conviction that it was possible to escape rigid class origins through highly visible \ncareers in entertainment. \nScholars in Media and Cultural Studies have long argued that social classifications are complex political \nformations characterised by representational struggles. All processes of social classification - such as gendering \nand racialization - are necessarily mediated and these representational struggles are often played out through \nhighly condensed figurative forms. We have argued that celebrity figures play an increasingly central role in the \nmediation and communication of class differences. Celebrity is a key vehicle through which value is distributed \nin public culture, and is instrumental in practices of distinction-making between individuals and groups in \neveryday life. For example, \u2017celebrity preferences\u2018 are now regularly invoked alongside other social cues, such \nas accent, ways of dressing, eating habits, television viewing habits, as a means of making class judgements. \nIndeed, celebrities are frequently employed as a shorthand designation of class: \u2017she is a \n14 \n \n\u2015Britney\u2016\/\u2015Jade\u2016\/\u2015Kate\u2016\u2018. Despite deepening economic polarization (see Toynbee and Walker, 2008: 5), social \nclass in Britain is in many respects harder to read on the bodies of individuals than previously. As a result, \ncelebrity has become an important means of identifying class distinctions precisely because older forms of class \ndistinction no longer operate effectively. In this respect, celebrity media, from Hello! magazine to online \ninfotainment blogs, function as etiquette guides that are employed by readers as a means of making wider class \ndistinctions and judgements.  \nIn this article we have argued that social class is not only the unacknowledged framing device through which \nindividual celebrities are judged and valued, but is the central axis from which this entire field of cultural \nproduction unfolds. Celebrity culture cannot be conceived as a distinct sphere of cultural production; whilst \nspecific media, such as magazines, television shows and films, are the engines of celebrity culture and publicity, \nthe distinctions between these platforms are increasingly blurred as online news and entertainment forums and \nblogs and celebrity brands extend celebrity personae into everyday life. As the media through which celebrity is \ncommunicated proliferate, celebrity figures and celebrity gossip play an increasingly central role in everyday \npractices of social classification. However, whilst the distinctions between the producers and audiences of \ncelebrity are also eroded through more participatory media such as blogs, it is a mistake to view this \u2017widening \nof participation\u2018 as indicative of \u2017social levelling\u2018. On the contrary, celebrity needs to be theorized as a \ndisciplinary field within which social values and morals are continually negotiated and reaffirmed. The different \nsocial positioning of audiences always allows for resistant readings, but nevertheless, it is imperative that we \nacknowledge the central role of celebrity culture in legitimating often virulent class antagonisms in \ncontemporary Britain. A better understanding of the ways in which celebrity stories, bodies and identities are \nused and exchanged in the processes and circuits of class-making not only enables a greater awareness of the \nlived inequalities reproduced by these processes of social classification, but it also enables prejudice to be \nidentified and challenged.    \n \n \nReferences \n \nAnon (2007) `Weisz Slams \"Vulgar\" Celebrity Culture`.
