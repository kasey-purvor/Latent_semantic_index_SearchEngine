Most of the RTA studies to date have con-\ncentrated on structures containing dilute nitride quantum\nwells. However, the intermixing of group IIIs has a dramatic\neffect on PL spectra and x-ray rocking curves, and leads to\ndifficulties in understanding unambiguously the true effects\nof postgrowth annealing on the structural properties and\npoint defects. The annealing of dilute nitride bulk materials\ncould be an effective way to investigate the structural\nchanges occurring during the annealing process, thus helping\nto reveal the nature of the point defects in these as-grown\nmaterials. Bosker et al.10 have reported a N \u201ckick-off\u201d diffu-\nsion mechanism involving interstitial N and substitutional N\nexchange during the annealing of GaAsN, but there have\nbeen very few fundamental studies reported to date.5,6,10,11 In\nthis article, we report on the effect of RTA of GaAsN bulk\nalloys studied using PL and double-crystal x-ray diffraction\n\u0001DCXRD\u0002 measurements. Our investigation reveals a blue-\nshift of PL emission peak energy and a decrease of the emis-\nsion linewidth after RTA. More importantly, we observed a\nsignificant anomalous strain enhancement during annealing\nwhich reflects the changes in N-related point defects.\nThe GaAsN epilayers were grown by solid source mo-\nlecular beam epitaxy \u0001MBE\u0002 using a radio frequency \u0001rf\u0002\nplasma nitrogen source. GaAsN epilayers, 200 nm thick,\nwere deposited after the growth of a GaAs buffer layer at\n480 \u00b0C, using a growth rate of 1.0 \u0002m\/h and a rf power of\n200 W. The nitrogen background was set at 5.0\u000110\u22127 Torr.\nThe reflected high-energy electron diffraction \u0001RHEED\u0002 pat-\ntern was clearly \u00012\u00014\u0002 for all of the growths. Samples 4\n\u00014 mm2 were annealed between 600 \u00b0C and 900 \u00b0C for 60\ns using a RTA system with a N2 ambient. The samples were\ncovered by a GaAs wafer \u0001face to face\u0002 to prevent the loss of\narsenic at elevated temperatures. PL and DCXRD were mea-\nsured on each piece of the sample before and after annealing,\nand were compared to investigate the effect of annealing.\nFigure 1\u0001a\u0002 shows typical 10 K PL spectra from GaAsN\nbefore and after annealing at 750 \u00b0C for 60 s. The emission\npeak at \u00051.02 \u0002m originates from dilute nitride. The broad\nband near 1.5 \u0002m might originate from recombination via\ndefect levels associated with oxygen.12 After annealing, a\nblueshift of the PL peak energy and a reduction of the line-\nwidth are clearly evident. However, the normally reported\nimprovement in integrated PL intensity is not observed. This\nis not understood clearly, but presumably is due to surface\ndegradation and an increased recombination velocity after\nannealing.6\nFigure 1\u0001b\u0002 shows the dependence of PL peak energy\nand linewidth narrowing on annealing temperature. The blue-\nshift increases with increasing annealing temperature and\nsaturates above 750 \u00b0C, while the linewidth decreases and\nreaches a minimum between 750 \u00b0C and 800 \u00b0C. The two\nmost likely contributions to the blueshift of emission peak\nenergy are \u0001i\u0002 loss of nitrogen, due to the correlation of ni-\ntrogen composition with the peak energy of PL emission at\nlow temperature7 and \u0001ii\u0002 an improvement in uniformity ofa\u0002Electronic mail: q.zhuang@lancaster.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 101, 103536 \u00012007\u0002\n0021-8979\/2007\/101\u000210\u0001\/103536\/4\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics101, 103536-1\nDownloaded 11 Mar 2008 to 194.80.32.9.

More importantly, no corresponding decrease of the\nsplitting angle in the DXRD measurements after annealing\nwas observed. We therefore attribute the blueshift to an im-\nprovement in the homogeneity of the alloy. Previous studies\nindicate that the low-temperature PL emission originates\nfrom the recombination of localized excitons trapped by\nN-related states near the GaAsN band edge due to the non-\nuniformity of the nitrogen distribution.13 The PL spectrum\nexhibits the features of a very asymmetric line shape with a\nsharp, high-energy cutoff and an exponential low-energy tail.\nThis transition energy is lower than the band-band energy\nand the emission correlates as expected with laser excitation\npower and temperature.14 Figure 1\u0001c\u0002 shows the 4 K PL spec-\ntra measured at laser powers in the range of 0.5\u201310 mW for\nas-grown material and a sample annealed at 750 \u00b0C. A blue-\nshift of 27 meV was observed for as-grown sample and only\n5 meV for the annealed sample. The reduction in the blue-\nshift is attributed to an improvement of the uniformity of the\nnitrogen distribution, which decreases the localization en-\nergy, and as a consequence the transition energy moves\ncloser to the band gap \u0001i.e., blueshift at elevated annealing\ntemperature\u0002. This improvement is reflected in narrowing of\nthe linewidth.\nDCXD rocking curves of as-grown and annealed\nsamples \u0001at 800 \u00b0C\u0002 are shown in Fig. 2. An anomalous but\nsignificant strain enhancement is observed after annealing.\nThe inset shows the strain enhancement increases with in-\ncreasing annealing temperature and saturates above 750 \u00b0C.\nThe enhanced strain always implies a high composition of\nsubstitutional nitrogen. Similar strain enhancement has been\nreported for GaAsN alloys oven-annealed at 450 \u00b0C for 5\nmin, and was attributed to increased N incorporation during\nannealing.6 However, this is unlikely in our experiments due\nto the absence of a corresponding redshift of PL peak energy\nand the short annealing time. We believe the strain enhance-\nment might be attributed to N-As split interstitials.\nAlthough it is believed that nitrogen incorporates in\nGaAs predominantly on the As sublattice, there are some\nother N configurations such as \u0001i\u0002 N-N split interstitials; \u0001ii\u0002\nN-As split interstitials; and \u0001iii\u0002 the isolated interstitial N. It\nhas been reported that the isolated interstitial N is unlikely to\nbe formed due to a high formation energy.15 Veal et al.16\nreported that no interstitial exists in GaAsN; this might be\ndue to the different growth conditions. It is reported that the\n\u00012\u00011\u0002 reconstruction could suppress interstitial nitrogen\nsignificantly.17 Typically, a large fraction of interstitial nitro-\ngen was revealed by nuclear reaction analysis and Rutherford\nbackscattering spectrometry17,18 and by comparison of data\nFIG. 3.

The effect\nof these N-related complexes on the lattice constant can be\ncalculated based on a simple model produced by Chen et\nal.20 Equations \u00011\u0002 and \u00012\u0002 give the lattice strain \u0003a \/a caused\nby NAs, substitutional and N-As or N-N split interstitial com-\nplexes, respectively,\n\u0003a\na\n=\nC11 + 2C12\nC11\nrN \u2212 rAs\nrGa + rAs\nx\n2\n, \u00011\u0002\n\u0003a\na\n=\nC11 + 2C12\nC11\ndb \u2212 rGa \u2212 rAs\nrGa + rAs\nx\n2\n. \u00012\u0002\nHere, rN, rAs, and rGa are the covalent radii of N, As, and Ga,\nrespectively.

The effect of N-N split\ninterstitials can be neglected since there is no contribution to\nstrain enhancement. Figure 4 also shows clearly that contrary\nto substitutional nitrogen, which gives rise to a reduction in\nlattice constant, the N-As split interstitial dilates the lattice\nconstant. Hence, its existence compensates the tensile strain\nof the GaAsN alloy. During annealing, the N-As split inter-\nstitials become broken to form Ga-As bonds, and the nitro-\ngen is thus released and diffuses out. The annihilation of the\nsplit interstitials decreases the dilation of the lattice constant\nand results in a strain enhancement. It can be expected that\nby increasing the annealing temperature more interstitial\nbonds will be broken, with further outdiffusion of N and a\ncorresponding shift in the DCXRD curve, which would be-\ncome constant once the split interstitials are completely an-\nnihilated. The strain enhancement therefore provides the pos-\nsibility of determining the concentration of N-As split\ninterstitials.\nAbove a temperature of 750 \u00b0C, the DCXRD angle does\nnot change and we may assume that nearly all the interstitials\nhave been annihilated. Consequently, the x-ray result on the\nannealed sample gives the concentration of substitutional ni-\ntrogen, which is 1.78%. However, due to the existence of\ninterstitial nitrogen the x-ray result on as-grown sample leads\nto an apparent nitrogen composition of 1.7%. We believe the\ndifference is caused by the annihilation of interstitial nitro-\ngen, and the concentration of interstitial nitrogen can thereby\nbe deduced from this difference by simulating the contribu-\ntions of interstitial nitrogen to the lattice constant \u0001as shown\nin Fig. 4\u0002. We estimate that the concentration of interstitial\nnitrogen in our sample is 1.8\u00011019 cm\u22123, in excellent agree-\nment with a recent report18 of 2\u00011019 cm\u22123. To determine\nthe total nitrogen composition \u0001substitutional and interstitial\nnitrogen\u0002 of the as-grown GaAsN, this interstitial nitrogen\nhas to be included, giving a total nitrogen composition of\n1.84%.\nIn summary, we have studied the effect of RTA on the\noptical and structural properties of bulk GaAsN alloys using\nlow-temperature PL spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction mea-\nsurements. With increasing annealing temperature, a blue-\nshift of PL emission peak energy and narrowing of the emis-\nsion linewidth have been observed. DCXRD reveals a\nsignificant strain enhancement as a result of RTA. This can\nbe attributed to the annihilation of As-N split interstitials\nformed during MBE growth. Based on a point defect model,\nwe have deduced the concentration of interstitial nitrogen to\nbe 1.8\u00011019 cm\u22123, and the composition of substitutional ni-\ntrogen to be 1.78%.\nThe research was support by the Engineering and Physi-\ncal Sciences Research Council \u0001U.K.\u0002 through the PHOTON\nproject.\n1M.
