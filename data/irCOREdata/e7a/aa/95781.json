They include the digital natives, the net generation, the Google generation or the \nmillenials. All of these terms are being used to highlight the significance and importance of new \ntechnologies within the lives of young people (Gibbons, 2007).  For some, new technologies have \nbeen such a defining feature in the lives of younger generations that they predict a fundamental \nchange in the way young people communicate, socialise, create and learn. They argue that this \nshift has profound implications for education (e.g. Prensky, 2001a; Gibbons, 2007; Rainie, 2006 \nand Underwood, 2007). Typically, supporters of this concept view the differences between those \nwho are or who are not digital natives as primarily about when a person was born. This paper will \ncritique and show new evidence against this conception of the digital native as based purely on \ngenerational differences. The paper will separate the \u2018doing\u2019 from the \u2018being\u2019, that is it will propose \na number of digital activities (doing) that indicate digital nativeness and then examine which types \nof people (being) are most likely to demonstrate these characteristics. The paper will show that \nbreadth of use, experience, self-efficacy and education are just as, if not more, important than \nage in explaining how people become digital natives.  \n \nPrior to presenting the findings, it is useful to provide a brief review of the literature on this topic. \nThe central argument to support the concept of the digital native is that young people born in the \nlast two decades have always been surrounded by, and interacted with, new technologies.  \nAccording to Prensky, one of the more radical consequences of this technology rich environment \nis a hypothesized change in the brain structure that means young people think and process \ninformation in fundamentally different ways compared to older generations (Prensky, 2001a; \nPrensky, 200b). He explains, \u201cDigital Natives are used to receiving information really fast. They \nlike to parallel process and multi-task. They prefer their graphics before their text rather than the \nopposite. They prefer random access (like hypertext). They function best when networked. They \nthrive on instant gratification and frequent rewards. They prefer games to \u201cserious\u201d work \n 1\n(2001a:1). Prensky defines this younger generation as the digital natives as they, are all \u201cnative \nspeakers\u201d of the digital language of computers, video games and the Internet\u201d (2001a:1).  \n \nPrensky refers to people who were born before this new digital era, which began around 1980, as \nDigital Immigrants. According to him digital immigrants may learn to use new technologies but will \nstill be in some way located within the past, unable to fully understand the natives. Prensky likens \nthis to the difference between learning a new language and being a native speaker. According to \nhim, characteristics of digital immigrants include: not going to the Internet first for information, \nprinting things out as opposed to working on screen, and reading manuals rather than working \nthings out online. The supporters of this concept suggest that the differences between these two \ngroups have profound implications for education. They argue that young people now have a \nrange of different preferences, tools and ways of processing and using information that do not fit \nwell with current educational practices. Thus, the current pedagogies employed in education need \nto change. For example, Prensky suggests that educators now need to communicate in a way \nthat fits with needs of the digital natives i.e., \u201cgoing faster, less step-by step, more in parallel, with \nmore random access, among other things\u201d. (2001a:2). A powerful teaching method, Prensky \nsuggests, would be to use computer games to teach the digital natives. Supporters of this view \nsee a gap or \u201cdigital disconnect\u201d between students and teachers (Underwood, 2007) that is \ndifficult to bridge. In Prensky\u2019s terms, the natives are being taught by immigrants who are, in \neffect, not talking the same language (Prensky, 2001a). \n \nThe use of the digital native term has become popular in public and political debate. A quick \nGoogle search using this term provides 910 hits for UK websites created in the last year (17,400 \nworldwide) and a Nexis search throws up 48 UK newspaper articles that used this term in the last \nyear (114 world wide in English language newspapers).  In comparison, Web of Science only \n 2\ncites 2 and Scopus only 12 academic articles which ever mentioned this term1. This suggests that \nwhile the term is popular, there is not much academic research in this area.  \n \nIn fact there is very little evidence that young people are radically different in the ways they use \nand process information (Bennet et al., 2008). To justify his claims Prensky draws on the widely \nheld theory of neuroplasticity, which, simply put, suggests our brains are plastic, flexible and \nsubject to change throughout life in response to changes in the environment. Thus young \npeople\u2019s brains have developed differently to adults as they have grown up in a world surrounded \nby new technologies. However, it is not yet known what differences (if any) there are in the brain \nstructure of adults and young people who use the Internet and other new technologies.  As \nPrensky himself admits, exactly how the brain is changing as a result of growing up with and \nusing technology and the implications this has for cognitive processes associated with learning \nare still being explored by neuroscientists (Prensky, 2001b).  \n \nThere is a growing body of academic research that has questioned the validity of the generational \ninterpretation of the digital native concept. Those in support of this digital native \/ immigrant \ndistinction tend to assign broad characteristics (e.g. a specific learning style, amount and type of \ntechnology use and \/ or set of learning preferences) to an entire generation (Bennet et al., 2008) \nand suggest all young people are expert with technology. Yet, while the proportion of young \npeople who use the Internet and other new technologies is higher than the older population (e.g. \nDutton and Helsper, 2007; Cheong, 2008) there are significant differences in how and why young \npeople use these new technologies and how effectively they use them (e.g.  DiMaggio and \nHargittai, 2001; Facer & Furlong 2001;Hargittai and Hinnart, 2008; Livingstone & Helsper, 2007). \nIndeed, a number of writers have highlighted the complexity and diversity of use of new \ntechnologies by young people which tends to be ignored or minimized in many arguments in \nsupport of the digital native. \n \n                                                     \n1 All searches performed March 2009 using the \u201cdigital native\u201d search term. \n 3\nA second, equally important aspect of this debate is the extent to which the differences between \ndigital natives and digital immigrants can be explained by generational differences. For Prensky, \nage seems to be the defining factor. For Tapscott (1998) who refers to the \u201cgeneration lap\u201d (i.e. \ntechnology is the one place where young people are better than older people) a digital native is \ndefined by exposure to, or experience with, technology. For some writers it appears it does not \nmatter a great deal if it is age or experience which defines if someone is a digital native or part of \nthe net generation (Oblinger and Oblinger, 2005).  \n \nHowever, whether the extent to which a person is a digital native is about date of birth or about a \ncertain amount of exposure, experience or expertise with new technologies, is an important \nquestion for policy and practice. If characteristics of a digital native are determined by age then \nolder generations are lost and a solution to a \u2018digital disconnect\u2019 between adults and younger \npeople is out of sight. However, if being tech savvy is determined by exposure and experience \nthen collaboration and learning is possible in environments where younger and older generations \ninteract. The distinction between generational and experience aspects of \u2018digital nativeness\u2019 has \nbeen less well researched because the majority of previous studies examining young people\u2019s \nuse of technology tend to focus on young people and their parents (e.g. studies by Livingstone \nand Bober (2005) and Facer et al., 2003)) not young people as part of the wider population. In \naddition, the vast majority of the evidence cited in support of the concept of the digital native is \nbased on data from the United States. Before educational policy makers and practitioners begin \nto change the educational system in the UK in response to these claims we need more empirical \nevidence to inform the debate (Kennedy, et al., 2008). \n \nThis paper aims to add to this discussion by providing evidence on how the British population \naccess and use the Internet and other new technologies from a nationally representative face-to-\nface survey (the Oxford Internet Surveys). While this cannot tell us anything about the structure of \nthe brain or cognitive processes, this data enables us to explore and test the basic assumptions \nof the digital native \/ digital immigrant concept. An answer to this question will inform the extent to \n 4\nwhich it is possible to get teachers to \u201ctalk the same language\u201d as their students, add to the \ndebate about what and how we should be educating young people and has implications for the \ncurrent policies to support family learning i.e. the extent to which carers and parents can support \ntheir children using new technologies in the home.  \n \nSpecifically, we will untangle the different aspects of what a native is by exploring whether acting \nlike a digital native is determined by: \n  \n1) age \u2013 the youngest generation who has grown up with technology and does not know \nany other context \n2) experience \u2013 those who have been on the Internet the longest, while they might not have \ngrown up with the Internet when young, they have been \u2018submerged\u2019 in it for the longest \nperiod of time; or \n3) breadth of use \u2013 those for whom the Internet is integrated into almost every aspect of \ntheir everyday lives independent of their age or experience. \n \nIn this paper we examine this by exploring the importance of these three variables in determining \nif someone is a digital native. While an exact definition of being a digital native is not often \npresented in the literature we define it here as someone who multi-tasks, has access to a range \nof new technologies, is confident in their use of technologies, uses the Internet as a first port of \ncall for information and \u2013 given the educational focus of this article - uses the Internet for learning \nas well as other activities.  \nMethod\u00a0\nThe data upon which this article is based is taken from the 2007 Oxford Internet Survey (OxIS), \ncarried out by the Oxford Internet Institute (University of Oxford) which provides authoritative \ninformation on Internet use and non-use in Britain. The surveys are multistage probability sample \nsurveys of individuals 14 years and older, and are carried out face to face. The 2007 survey was \n 5\nconducted during March and April 2007 with 2,350 respondents (a response rate of 77%) of \nwhich 1,578 were Internet users.  Areas covered in the survey include information about: Internet \nusers (who uses \/ doesn't use the Internet, and how they gain access to it); Internet uses \n(including e-learning, e-government, e-entertainment and e-finance); and impacts of the Internet \non everyday life (including changing habits and practices, privacy concerns and attitudes to \ntechnology).  \n \nIn this paper we make the distinction between those who are more and less comfortable with the \nInternet. We focus just on those who have some exposure to the technology and do not focus on \nnon-Internet users or ex-users. For a more detailed discussion of non-users please see Dutton \nand Helsper (2007). Since young people are currently more likely to use the Internet than the \nelderly and retired this influences the final sample and this will be taken into consideration in the \nconclusions drawn in this paper.  \n \nWe start this paper by carrying out descriptive analyses of age, experience and breadth of use in \nrelation to media richness of the household (i.e. the number of ICTs in the household), their level \nof Internet self-efficacy, if someone goes to the Internet first for information, if they multitask and \nwhat they use the Internet for. OxIS asks a number of questions about the kinds of activities \npeople carry out online and from these twelve general categories of Internet uses were \nconstructed based on an exploratory factor analyses. The following twelve types of Internet use \nwere identified: fact checking, training, current affairs and Interests, travel, finance, shopping, \nentertainment, social networking, diary functions, person to person networking, e-government and \ncivic participation (see Helsper, Dutton & Gerber 2009).  \n \nAs this analysis did not provide a clear answer to our question we then carried out a series of \nlinear regressions to identify the variables that explain who has the most media rich household, \nwho has high levels of Internet self-efficacy, who goes to the Internet first for information, who \nmultitasks and who is more likely to use the Internet for learning. All of the twelve different types \n 6\nof Internet use identified from the factor analysis could arguably be seen as indicators of learning. \nHowever, there are three factors that seem most directly related to learning and education: fact \nchecking (using the Internet to look up a definition of a word or checking a fact); training and \nlearning (looking for jobs, distance learning for an academic degree, getting information for a \nschool related project, getting information for a work related project, finding out opportunities for \nfurther study) and current affairs and interests searching (news, sports, local events, health). \nThese three factors were chosen for the linear regression because they seem the most closely \nrelated to potential learning opportunities and thus most relevant to the focus of this paper. \nResults\u00a0\u00a0\nAs noted above we explored the significance of generation, experience and breadth of use in \ndefining a digital native. Prior to utilizing these variables it is valuable to define them and examine \nthe relationship between them. \n \nAge is a self explanatory variable, nevertheless since the concept of the digital native is so \nclosely linked to generations it is important to define which generation is considered digitally \nnative. Prensky\u2019s original definition considered those born after 1980 digitally native, but in most \nof the recent literature this category seems to have shifted. Arguably the rise of web 2.0 \napplications might have created a second generation of digital natives which can be separated \nfrom the first due to their familiarity and immersion in this new, web 2.0, digital world. The current \ngeneration of teenagers born after 1990 (currently 18 or younger) is here identified as second \ngeneration digital natives, while the young adults born between 1983 and 1990 (currently \nbetween 18 and 25 years old) are considered the first generation of digital natives. \n \nIt is important to define what we mean by experience and breadth of use. Experience is \noperationalised as years of using the Internet. Breadth of use is operationalised as the number of \ndifferent activities a person undertakes online. Breadth of use was calculated based on a factor \nanalyses of all the uses of the Internet measured in OxIS (see Helsper, Dutton & Gerber 2009) \n 7\nand then summing all these activities into a scale from 0 to 12.  Since we are looking at Internet \nusers only the scale runs from 1 to 12 because they undertake at least 1 of the 12 types of \nactivities on the Internet. In addition, OxIS measures an individual\u2019s level of self-efficacy (how \ngood are you at using the internet?)  to have a subjective indicator of expertise. \n \nDescriptive analyses of OxIS showed that breadth and self-efficacy were strongly correlated with \nage, but experience was not. That is, younger generations might have expertise, measured by a \nwide range of uses (r=-.17; p<.01) and high levels of self-efficacy (r=-.20; p<.01), but they have \nnot necessarily spent more or less years using the Internet (r=.02; p=.45).  The latter is important \nbecause it offers an opportunity to understand the differential effect of experience and generation \non the \u2018digital nativeness\u2019 of an individual by comparing people of different age groups with the \nsame number of years of experience. \n  \nLet us first look at each of these three variables more closely in relation to those factors that we \nearlier earmarked as indicators of digital nativeness: use of the Internet, media richness, the \nimportance of the Internet as an information source and types of Internet use. That is the extent \nto which generation, experience or breadth of use can help us to define digital \u201cnativeness\u201d.   \nGeneration\u00a0\n[TABLE 1 HERE] \n \nLooking at the population as a whole, younger people were more likely to be digital natives as \nthey have a wider variety of ICTs at home and were more likely to be Internet users (see Table \n1). Interestingly the biggest drop in the proportion of Internet users was when users were over 55 \nyears old, which means that majority of educators and parents of younger children do use the \nInternet.  \n[TABLE 2 HERE] \n 8\n Table 2 shows that younger age groups can indeed be qualified as digital natives in terms of the \nprominence that ICTs and the Internet have in their lives. The youngest Internet users (second \ngeneration digital natives) lived in households with the widest variety of ICTs and they used the \nInternet as a first port of call for the widest range of activities in comparison to almost all other \ngenerations. They also multitasked significantly more and referred to the Internet more than \nothers for information for school and work. For most indicators of digital nativeness there was a \nlinear decline with age and a clear drop in the 44 to 54 or 55 to 64 age groups. \n \n[TABLE 3 HERE] \nTable 3 provides an overview of what different age groups used the Internet for. Not surprisingly \nthe teenage group was least likely to manage their finances online or use e-government. Younger \npeople, when they did use the Internet were also less likely to use the Internet for civic \nparticipation and this corresponds to what we know about offline behaviour. Younger people were \nmore likely to use the Internet for entertainment, social networking and diary functions. In terms of \nthe three activity types most closely related to learning young people were more likely to use the \nInternet for fact checking (definitions of words and checking facts) and training (looking for jobs, \neLearning, online courses). For current affairs and interests the differences between age groups \nwere not significant. The linear decline by age in relation to the types of activities people engage \nwith was less clear then when we looked at other indicators of digital nativeness. Although \nentertainment and social networking activities dropped steeply for those who were neither first nor \nsecond generation digital natives (14 to 25 year olds), for other activities related to applications \nfor which some economical capital is necessary (shopping, investment and travel) first generation \ndigital natives (18-25 year olds) were, not surprisingly, more likely than second generation digital \nnatives (14-17 year olds) to participate. \n 9\nExperience\u00a0\nExperience was also an important variable in relation to \u201cdigital nativeness\u201d. In general there was \nan increase in household media richness (r=.22; p<.01), the importance of the Internet (r=.29; \np<.01), multitasking (r=.20; p<.01) and internet self-efficacy (r=.38; p<.01) with an increase of \nexperience. Thus those who had experienced the Internet for longer periods of time were more \ndigitally native. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the most recent users (less than 6 \nmonths) of use showed higher levels of self-efficacy (51% good or excellent skills), media \nrichness (av=2.78), and importance of the internet (av=2.10) than those who had used the \ninternet for 6 months to one year (28% good or excellent skills; av= 2.59 media richness; av=1.99 \ninternet as first port of call). . The difference was especially large for self-efficacy. We could call \nthis the \u2018honeymoon\u2019 period in which the new user tries everything out and feels like the world is \nat their feet, after a few months (half a year) their enthusiasm dies down and they realise that \nthere are many things they cannot do.  \n \n[TABLE 4 HERE] \n \nIn contrast to what was found for generational groups (see Table 3), all differences between \nexperience groups were significant (see Table 4). Almost always it was those with the most \nexperience, that is having used the Internet for more than 5 years, who used the Internet most \nindependent of the activity observed. There were a few exceptions, entertainment, which the \nmost novice users undertook more than the intermediate users. Current affairs and interests and \nperson to person networking also showed a slight dip for those who had used the Internet \nbetween 6 months and 1 year in comparison to those who had used it less than that. For many \nother activities, including the three learning related activities (i.e. fact checking, training and \nlearning and current affairs and interests) use showed a large increase for those individuals who \nhad used the Internet for more than 1 year. \n 10\nBreadth\u00a0of\u00a0use\u00a0\nThe sum of all the internet uses discussed in the previous sections can be called the breadth of \nuse, and the higher the number different activities a person undertakes the more the internet is \nintegrated into the person\u2019s everyday life.  \n \nThe increase in digital nativeness was exponential in relation to breadth of use. Not only were \nthose with a narrow use less likely to multitask (r=.40;p<.01),, they were also less likely to use the \nInternet as a first port of call (r=.45;p<.01), and had far lower levels of internet self-efficacy \n(r=.49;p<.01),. In addition, they had a smaller variety of ICTs in their households (r=.37; p<.01). \n \nTo understand how this type of expertise, or embededness in the Internet, is related to specific \nuses of the internet we grouped the number of different activities a person undertook based on \nquintiles of internet users. That is, we constructed five almost equally sized groups of internet \nusers with different levels of breadth of use. \n \n[TABLE 5 HERE] \n \nSimilar to what we found for experience groups, all differences between breadth of use groups \nwere significant (see Table 5).  There was a pattern in the order in which people began to use the \nInternet for different purposes. The most popular activities for people who only used the Internet \nfor one or two things tended to be shopping and travel, then, as the range of use increased, \nInternet users were more likely to use the Internet for current \/ affairs, training, entertainment, \nperson to person networking and fact checking.  Using the Internet for social networking, finance, \nand diary functions were activities that were more likely to be undertaken by those who use the \nInternet for 10-12 activities than by those who undertake less than 10 activities.  \n 11\nGeneration,\u00a0experience\u00a0and\u00a0breadth\u00a0of\u00a0use\u00a0\u00a0\nThus, the descriptives do not give straight forward answers to the question of what determines \ndigital nativeness: age, experience, and breadth of use all seem important. Only by looking at \ntheir independent effect can we sort out which factors really determine who shows the \ncharacteristics of a digital native. Below we examine the importance of these three variables \nalongside gender, whether or not there are children in the household and level of education, in \nexplaining: 1) being surrounded by all kinds of different technologies; 2) using the Internet as a \nfirst port of call for information; 3) multi-tasking; 4) self-efficacy and 5) using the Internet for three \ntypes of learning activities that are the focus here (fact checking, training and learning and current \naffairs and interests).  \n[TABLE 6 HERE] \n \nGeneration, experience and breadth of use were all significantly and independently related to the \nmedia richness of the household (see Table 6a). Younger people, those who had used the \nInternet for longer and those who had integrated the Internet into a wider variety of activities had \nmore different ICTs in the household. In addition, the presence of children in the household and \nhigh levels of educational achievement were strongly related to the variety of technologies one \nhad access to at home. Breadth of use and the presence of children in the household had a \nlarger relative impact (based on standardized coefficients) on the media richness of the \nhousehold than the age of the person. \n \nGeneration, experience and breadth of use were all important predictors of using the Internet as a \nfirst port of call as a benchmark for digital natives (see Table 6b). In contrast to the media \nrichness of the household, children and the level of education were not significantly related to \nusing the Internet as a first port of call. However, women were significantly less likely than men to \nuse the Internet as the first port of call. The strongest predictor of using the internet as the first \nport of call was the breadth of a person\u2019s Internet use. \n \n 12\n[TABLE 7 HERE] \n \nSimilar to what was shown for media richness and using the internet as a first port of call, \ngeneration, experience and breadth of use were also good predictors for digital nativeness  when \nmultitasking was taken as the ultimate indicator of this type of person (see Table 7a). Similar to \ninternet use as a first port of call, level of education and having children did not influence the \nextent to which a person multi-tasked. \n \n The importance of self-efficacy in relation to positive learning outcomes has been clear in offline \nlearning. Similarly, the extent to which people report that their ability to use the Internet is poor, \nfair, good or excellent is a good predictor of Internet use and positive attitudes towards using the \nInternet as a source for information (see also Eastin & LaRose, 2000). However, it is not clear \nwhether Internet self-efficacy itself is best explained by generation, experience and \/ or breadth of \nuse. Table 7b shows that generation, but also experience and breadth of use as well as level of \neducation were important in relation to how confident people were in their own Internet skills.  \n \n[TABLE 8 HERE] \n \nDifferent indicators predict the three types of learning activities (fact checking; training and \nlearning and current affairs (see Table 8). For fact checking breadth of use was proportionately \nthe most important variable, generation and level of education were also significant predictors. In \nother words those who used the Internet for more purposes, were younger and had a higher level \nof education were more likely to use the Internet for fact checking. Breadth of use was also very \nimportant for training and learning, in addition this type of Internet activity was more likely to be \nundertaken by those with more education, those who were younger, those who considered \nthemselves more expert at using technologies and women. For current affairs breadth of use was \nagain important, along with generation and gender. Men and older generations were more likely \n 13\nto use the Internet to keep up with current affairs. Experience (years) with using the Internet was \nnot significant for any of the learning activities nor was the presence of children in the household.  \nDiscussion\u00a0\u00a0\nIn this paper we have examined the extent to which generation, experience in using the Internet \nand breadth of use are good indicators of whether someone is a digital native or not. For the \npurposes of this paper a digital native has been defined as someone who comes from a media \nrich household, who uses the Internet as a first port of call for information, multi-tasks using ICTs \nand uses the Internet to carry out a range of activities particularly those with a focus on learning.  \n \nContrary to the argument put forward by proponents of the digital native concept, generation \nalone does not adequately define if someone is a digital native or not. From the analysis above it \nis clear that there are a range of factors involved. It appears that younger people do have a \ngreater range of ICTs in their household, tend to use the Internet as a first port of call, have \nhigher levels of Internet self-efficacy, multi-task more, and use the Internet for fact checking and \nformal learning activities. Nevertheless, generation was not the only significant variable in \nexplaining these activities: gender, education, experience and breadth of use also play a part. \nIndeed in all cases immersion in a digital environment (i.e. the breadth of activities that people \ncarry out online) tends to be the most important variable in predicting if someone is a digital \nnative in the way they interact with the technology.  \n \nIn some respects these findings do support the arguments put forward by Prensky and others. A \nlarger proportion of young people use the Internet, they are more likely to come from media rich \nhomes are more confident about their skills and are more likely to engage in online learning \nactivities. What implications this has for young people\u2019s brain structures remains an open \nquestion. Nevertheless,, what is very clear is that  it is not helpful to define digital natives and \nimmigrants as two distinct, dichotomous generations. While there were differences in how \ngenerations engaged with the internet there were similarities across generations as well mainly \n 14\nbased on how much experience people have with using technologies. In addition, the findings \npresented here confirm that individuals\u2019 Internet use lies along a continuum of engagement \ninstead of being a dichotomous divide between users and non-users (see also Warschauer, \n2002; Van Dijk 2005).   \n \nThis conclusion supports other research that has demonstrated that there are significant \ndifferences within cohorts of young people in terms of their preferences, skills and use of new \ntechnologies (e.g. Kennedy, et al., 2008). As Facer and Furlong argue young people are not, a \n\u201chomogeneous generation of digital children\u201d (Facer and Furlong, 2001: 467).  This research \nadds to existing research by showing that a generational distinction between natives and \nimmigrants, us and them, is not reflected in empirical data. Therefore, the distinction is not helpful \nand could even be harmful. For example, the inequalities in use and breadth of use within \nyounger generations could be exacerbated as teachers assume a level of knowledge in school \nlessons which may not be accurate for all students (Facer and Furlong, 2001); and teachers and \nparents do not help young people in this area as they feel powerless in trying to support them in \ntheir uses of the Internet and other new technologies (Cheong, 2008; Helsper, 2008b).  \n \nSo if generation is not the only defining characteristic of a digital native what implications does \nthis analysis have for education policy and practice? In terms of formal education there seem to \nbe two key messages. Firstly, it seems that adults, specifically teachers can \u201cspeak the same \nlanguage\u201d as their students if they want to. Younger people are more likely to have a wider variety \nof ICTs at home, use the Internet as a first port of call for information, multitask and use the \nInternet first for school \/ work information but many adults do as well. Tables 1-3 suggest that the \nbiggest drop off in these activities in terms of generation appears after the age of 55 \u2013 much later \nthan supporters of the digital native concept would have us believe and older than many \neducators.   \n \n 15\nOf course, some supporters of the digital native or net generation concept would agree that older \npeople can learn to use technologies. For, example Tapscott (1998) draws on the work of Piaget \nto explain that learning to use technology is an assimilative process for young people who have \nalways experienced technology as a part of their everyday lives. However, for older people where \nnew technologies have been introduced at some stage in their life time it is an accommodative \n(thus more difficult) process (Tapscott, 1998). Whether this is true or not  cannot be gleaned from \nour data, but the findings do suggest that older generations have accommodated ICTs to a great \nextent and in quite a few instances to the same level as younger people.  \n \nSecondly, this data helps to add to the debate in terms of what or how we teach young people in \nschools. While it is important to understand what young people are using new technologies for in \ndebates about future developments in pedagogy and curriculum; we cannot assume that just \nbecause young people do more of something it is always a good thing. For example, the analysis \nhere supports the view that young people multitask more. However, we do not know if this is a \npositive or negative aspect of young people\u2019s use of new technology. Multitasking may have a \nnegative impact on learning due to cognitive overload (Hembrooke and Gay 2003). Similarly, \nwhile young people are more likely to use the Internet as a first port of call for information this \ndoes not mean they are in fact skilled in dealing with and critically assessing information \n(Livingstone, 2008). Finally, while not the focus of this paper, there may not be much demand \nfrom young people for school to change as technology may well play very different roles in a \nstudent\u2019s lives in and out of school (Bennet et al., 2008).  \n \nThis data also has implications for supporting informal and family learning which are important \npolicy areas in the UK (Becta, 2008). It could be argued that there are potential learning benefits \nin many online activities from playing collaborative games to chatting in a forum. However, while \nin general in the policy literature access and use of the Internet is a \u201cgood thing\u201d there is very little \ndebate about the kinds of learning activities we want people to carry out online or indeed if any \nactivities are seen as more \u201cbeneficial\u201d for learning than others. Other studies with a broader \n 16\nfocus on different digital cultures and home socialization in relation to technologies argue that the \nimpact of home interaction with the Internet on formal education cannot and should not be \nignored because they influence what young people are able and willing to learn in school \n(Helsper, 2009).  Questions that educators need to ask themselves are, for example,, are we only \ninterested in supporting formal learning activities or are we satisfied if people just focus on playing \nonline games further developing skills they acquired in informal contexts?  In some ways this \nanalysis helps to address this question. The analysis has shown that immersion in the technology \n(ie. breadth of online activities) is an important factor (although not the only factor) in \nunderstanding whether people are confident in their ICT skills and whether they use the Internet \nfor the three learning activities classified here. Thus, perhaps policy makers should be developing \ninitiatives that encourage broad use of technologies as opposed to focusing on one or two narrow \nactivities. We speculatively conclude that immersion in ICTs, or perhaps more accurately, the \nintegration of ICTs in many aspects of a person\u2019s life, is likely to lead to the uptake of digital \nlearning opportunities and that Internet users are unlikely to ignore these learning activities if they \notherwise use technologies in a broad fashion.  \n \nIn terms of family learning there are also some interesting implications. Having children in the \nhousehold is a significant variable in the media richness of the household. Thus, it could be \nargued that older generations might acquire the technology because they think it will benefit their \nchildren (Van Rompaey, Roe, & Struys, 2002; Venkatesh & Vitalari, 1992). This obviously, has \npositive implications for learning. However, interestingly, based on the analysis here, the \npresence of children in the household does not influence parents\u2019 use of the Internet for their own \nlearning activities. Parents have an important role to play in supporting their own children\u2019s use of \ntechnology and our research shows know that generational gaps are far from insurmountable. \nNevertheless,  we still need to explore and better understand the link between children\u2019s use of \ntechnology, technology in the home and family learning.  \n \n 17\nFinally, our analysis has demonstrated the continuing importance of socio-demographic variables. \nSpecifically, education, and gender. The stronger a person\u2019s educational background the more \nlikely they are to feel confident in their ICT skills and use the Internet for learning activities, \nspecifically fact checking and training and learning. Our analysis has also shown that gender is \nimportant. It is important that these issues of social inclusion and exclusion are not ignored in \nthese debates around the idea of the digital native (Cheong, 2008; Facer and Furlong, 2001; \nHelsper, 2008a)  \nConclusion\u00a0\nAlthough young people do use the Internet more, our analysis does not support the view that \nthere are unbridgeable differences between those who can be classified as digital natives or \ndigital immigrants based on when they are born.  \n \nThis is important because the term digital native, net generation and other catchy terms are being \nused widely in public and political debate. The acceptance of these generalizations is especially \nproblematic in a context where JISC, BECTA and academics are investing significantly in \nresearch programmes that aim to explore and better understand learners\u2019 experiences of using \ntechnologies. More importantly, the frequent uncritical use of these and similar terms, even if the \nterm is used without accepting the underlying assumptions, could have a negative impact upon \nthe perceived possibilities of teacher- student interaction. \n \nProponents of a generational definition of concepts such as that of the digital native arguably \nsupport a view of society as a new era that is fundamentally different and signals a break with \nprevious times (Stevenson, 2002); where technology is a key driver of this change (Webster, \n2002). Yet what this data indicates is that the opposite is true \u2013 that contemporary society is a \ncontinuation of the past and technology, while important, is not the only determining factor in our \nlives. There can be a tendency within educational policy to see technology as the \u201cfix\u201d or \n\u201csolution\u201d to many of the challenges the sector faces (Robins and Webster, 1989) and there is a \n 18\ndanger that the current popularity of statements about young \u2018techy\u2019 generations could increase \nthe prominence of this deterministic view. To counter such claims the publication and discussion \nof empirical work on the realities of how younger and older generations learn through and engage \nwith technology is needed. This study and other research such as that by Facer and Furlong \n(2001), Bennet et al (2008) and Cheong, (2008) are steps in the right direction but further \nresearch and greater awareness amongst parents and practitioners is necessary. \n \nWhile survey data goes some way to understanding these issues, more qualitative work could \nalso be beneficial to explore the dynamics of family learning, what people actually do when they \nare online, how learning can take place and the importance of cognitive and neurological \ndevelopment. Reporting of use of the Internet is not the same as understanding the learning that \nmay take place as a result of this use. In particular, we lack studies that discuss household \nmember and peer interactions, for example in relation to proxy use, as regards the use of and \nlearning from ICTs. Such research is vital in order to refine and advance existing theories of \nlearning using new technologies.  \n \nPrensky, Oblinger and Oblinger and others are right - we need to understand learners in order to \nteach them well. We are not saying education should not change, but debates about change must \nbe based on empirical evidence and not rhetoric. \n \nReferences\u00a0\nBecta (2008) Harnessing Technology: Next Generation Learning 2008-2014.
