The predictive value of the index was\ncompared to factors that are known to predict mortality in\npatients with heart failure.\nResults: All patients underwent assessment of 16\nprognostic risk factors, including cardiovascular magnetic\nresonance (CMR) measures of myocardial scarring\n(gadolinium-hyperenhancement) and dyssynchrony,\nbefore implantation. Clinical events were assessed after a\nmedian follow-up of 913 (interquartile range 967) days. At\nfollow-up, 37\/148 (25%) of patients died from cardio-\nvascular causes. In Cox proportional hazards analyses,\n(DSC) Dyssynchrony, posterolateral Scar location (both\np,0.0001) and Creatinine (p = 0.0046) emerged as\nindependent predictors of cardiovascular mortality. The\nDSC index, derived from these variables combined,\nemerged as a powerful predictor of cardiovascular\nmortality. Compared to patients with a DSC ,3,\ncardiovascular mortality in patients in the intermediate\nDSC index (3\u20135; HR: 11.1 (95% confidence interval (CI)\n3.00 to 41.1), p = 0.0003) and high DSC index (>5; HR:\n30.5 (95% CI 9.15 to 101.8), p,0.0001) were higher.\nBootstrap validation confirmed excellent calibration and\ninternal validity of the prediction model.\nConclusion: The DSC index, derived from a standard\nCMR scan and plasma creatinine before implantation, is a\npowerful predictor of cardiovascular mortality after CRT.\nThe benefits of cardiac resynchronisation therapy\n(CRT) are well established. The Cardiac\nResynchronisation in Heart Failure (CARE-HF)\nstudy showed that, compared to optimum medical\ntherapy, CRT-pacing (CRT-P) led to a 36% relative\nreduction in total mortality.1 The Comparison of\nMedical Therapy, Pacing and Defibrillation in\nHeart Failure (COMPANION) study showed that\naddition of a cardioverter defibrillator (CRT-D) led\nto higher survival benefits than CRT-P.2 Predicting\nwhich patients derive a survival benefit from CRT,\nhowever, remains a challenge. Numerous echocar-\ndiographic studies have focused on measures of\ncardiac dyssynchrony as predictors of outcome,3\nbut no consensus has been reached as to their\nclinical applicability. In the recent Predictors of\nResponse to CRT (PROSPECT) study, which\nadopted left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling\nas a surrogate of survival, tissue Doppler imaging-\nbased measures of dyssynchrony were proved to\nadd little value to QRS duration in predicting the\noutcome of CRT.4 No echocardiographic measure\nhas been validated against mortality after CRT.\nCardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the\ngold standard for the in vivo assessment of\nmyocardial structure, function and dyssynchrony.5\nA recent pilot study has shown that a dyssyn-\nchrony measure derived from a standard CMR\nscan, the CMR tissue synchronisation index\n(CMR-TSI), is a powerful predictor of mortality\nand morbidity after CRT.6 As well as providing\nmeasures of dyssynchrony, CMR also allows\nvisualisation and quantification of myocardial\nscarring with late gadolinium enhacement (CMR-\nLGE).7 8 Importantly, the size (burden), transmur-\nality and location of a myocardial scar in the LV\nfree wall, the target location for LV leads, have\nbeen linked to a poor outcome after CRT.7\u20139\nWe have explored the value of pre-implant CMR\nmeasures of dyssynchrony and myocardial scar-\nring, as well as more conventional heart failure risk\nfactors,10 in predicting cardiovascular mortality\nafter CRT. This study focuses on the derivation\nand validation of a clinical risk index based on a\ncombination of such non-invasive measures.\nMETHODS\nPatients\nA total of 148 consecutive heart failure patients\nwere prospectively enrolled from January 2001 to\nApril 2008 at a single centre (Good Hope Hospital).\nPatients were selected if they were due to undergo\nCRT for standard indications (ischaemic or non-\nischaemic cardiomyopathy, New York Heart\nAssociation (NYHA) class III or IV, LV ejection\nfraction (LVEF) ,35%, QRS duration >120 ms).\nUntil publication of the UK National Institute for\nHealth and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Health\nTechnology Appraisal in CRT in 2007,11 the implan-\ntation rate for CRT-D in the UK was very low. All\npatients included in this study underwent CRT-P.\nAll patients had undergone coronary angiogra-\nphy. The clinical diagnosis of systolic heart failure\nwas based on clinical criteria and evidence of\nsystolic dysfunction on echocardiography. The\ndiagnosis of ischaemic cardiomyopathy was made\nHeart failure and cardiomyopathy\nHeart 2009;95:1619\u20131625. doi:10.1136\/hrt.2009.173880 1619\n group.bmj.com on July 13, 2010 - Published by heart.bmj.comDownloaded from \nif systolic dysfunction was associated with a history of\nmyocardial infarction,12 the findings of coronary angiography,\nor if the pattern of LGE was characteristic of a myocardial\ninfarction.13 All patients gave written informed consent and the\nstudy was approved by the North Birmingham ethics commit-\ntee.\nStudy design\nA CMR study was performed at baseline. The predictive risk\nindex was validated against cardiovascular death. For qualitative\ncomparisons with the CARE-HF study, we also considered the\ncomposite endpoint of death from any cause or hospitalisations\nfor major cardiovascular events, as defined in the CARE-HF\nstudy protocol.1 Mortality data were collected through medical\nrecords and, where appropriate, from interviews with patients\u2019\ncaregivers. Clinical outcome data were collected on a two-\nmonthly basis by an investigator who was blinded to other\nclinical and imaging data. Sudden cardiac death was defined as\n\u2018\u2018a natural, unexpected death due to cardiac causes, heralded by\nan abrupt loss of consciousness within one hour of the onset of\nacute symptoms or occurring during the sleep without\nworsening of heart failure in the preceding hours.\u2019\u201914\nDevice therapy\nImplantation of CRT-P devices was undertaken using standard\ntechniques under local anaesthesia. The LV lead position was\nchosen by the implanter, who was blinded to the CMR study.\nPatients who underwent successful implantation were followed\nup in a dedicated device therapy clinic. Patients in sinus rhythm\nunderwent trans-mitral Doppler-directed optimisation of atrio-\nventricular delay15 before discharge and at every scheduled visit\nthereafter. For patients in atrial fibrillation, right ventricular and\nLV leads were implanted and a biventricular generator was used,\nplugging the atrial port and programming the generator to a\nventricular-triggered mode. All patients were proved to have\nfunctional leads and generators throughout the study period.\nCardiovascular magnetic resonance\nImaging was performed using a 1.5 Tesla scanner (Signa, GE\nHealthcare, Slough, UK) and a phased array cardiac coil. A short\naxis LV stack was acquired using a steady state in free\nprecession sequence (SSFP, repetition time 3.0\u20133.8 ms; excita-\ntion time 1.0 ms; image matrix 2246224; field of view 36\u2013\n42 cm; flip angle 45u) in sequential 8-mm slices (2-mm interslice\ngap) from the atrio-ventricular ring to apex. Acquisition was\nperformed during gated 8-second breath-holds. Left ventricular\nend diastolic volume (LVEDV) and end-systolic (LVESV)\nvolume, and LVEF were quantified using manual planimetry\nof all short-axis SSFP cine images with MASS analysis software\n(Medis, Leiden, The Netherlands). The observer was blinded to\nechocardiographic and clinical data.\nThe CMR-TSI was measured as previously described.6 Briefly,\nthe maximum radial wall motion value of a radial wall motion\ntime series was chosen as the peak radial wall motion for each\nLV segment. The time-dependent segmental radial wall motion\ndata (y) were fitted to an empirical sine wave function y = a +\nb6 sin (t\/RR + c). The mean segmental radial wall motion (a),\nthe segmental radial wall motion amplitude (b) and the\nsegmental phase shift of the maximum radial wall motion (c)\nwere extracted from the fit. The non-linear least squares fit\nfunction implemented by Bates and DebRoy into the \u2018\u2018nls\u2019\u2019\npacket of R was used for the sine fit.16 The CMR-TSI was\nexpressed as the SD of all segmental phase shifts of the radial\nwall motion extracted from the fit. Therefore, the CMR-TSI is a\nmeasure of the temporal dispersion of peak inward myocardial\nmotion throughout the cardiac cycle. A high CMR-TSI, there-\nfore, denotes high temporal dispersion of inward wall motion.\nFor scar imaging using CMR-LGE, short-axis slices identical to\nthe LV stack were acquired using a segmented inversion-\nrecovery technique 10 minutes after the intravenous adminis-\ntration of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid\n(0.1 mmol\/kg). Inversion times were adjusted to null normal\nmyocardium (260\u2013400 ms). Scar volume was calculated by\nmultiplying the planimetered area of LGE in each slice by the\nslice thickness. Scar volume was expressed as a percentage of LV\nmyocardial volume in the diastolic phase. Areas of scar were\nthen segmented using a 17-segment model.17 A posterolateral\nscar was defined as a scar which, in this model, was located in\nsegments 6, 12, 16, 5 or 11, or in the lateral half of segments 1, 7,\n13, 17, 15, 10 and 4. Transmurality was also assessed using a 17-\nsegment model.17 A transmural posterolateral scar was defined\nas a scar with 51\u2013100% of the LV wall, measured radially.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables are expressed as mean (SD). Normality\nwas tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Variables which were\nnot normally distributed were log-transformed before statistical\nanalyses. Comparisons between normally distributed contin-\nuous variables were made using ANOVA with Scheffe\u2019s F\nprocedure for multiple comparisons. Categorical variables were\nanalysed using x2 tests and Scheffe\u2019s post-hoc test. Differences\nin Kaplan-Meier survival curves between the risk groups were\nassessed using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Areas under the\nreceiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) were used\nto derive optimal cut-off points for the DSC index. Statistical\nanalyses were performed using Statview and SPSS 13.0. Harrel\u2019s\n\u2018\u2018Design\u2019\u2019 package version 2.1-1in R was used for predictive\nmodelling.18 A two-tailed p value of ,0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant. In a previous study,6 intra-observer and\ninter-observer variabilities for CMR-TSI were 3.0% and 8.8%,\nrespectively.\nDevelopment of the risk index\nIn line with Harrell\u2019s recommendations on multivariate prog-\nnostic modelling,19 20 no more than m\/10 parameters were\nconsidered, where m is the number of uncensored events, in this\ncase cardiovascular deaths (n = 37). Candidate variables were\nselected on the basis of their proved clinical, pathophysiological\nand epidemiological relevance to the endpoint in question. A\nmeasure of cardiac dyssynchrony\u2014namely, CMT-TSI, was\nincluded in view of previous demonstration from echocardio-\ngraphic21 and radionuclide22 studies that extremes of dyssyn-\nchrony relate to a poor outcome in patients with heart failure.\nSimilarly, a posterolateral location of myocardial scar was\nchosen in view of its negative influence on outcome after\nCRT.8 9 Plasma creatinine was also selected given its emergence\nas a predictor of mortality in patients in heart failure in\nnumerous studies.10 23\u201327 These three variables were included in\nthe multiple regression model. Continuous rather than dichot-\nomous variables were used wherever possible.20 Interactions\nbetween variables were extensively explored using interaction\nterms in Cox proportional hazards models. Linearity assump-\ntions were checked using Martingale residuals. Cross-product\nterms were added to check for additivity assumptions. The\nproportional hazards assumption was checked using Schoenfeld\nresiduals.28\nHeart failure and cardiomyopathy\n1620 Heart 2009;95:1619\u20131625. doi:10.1136\/hrt.2009.173880\n group.bmj.com on July 13, 2010 - Published by heart.bmj.comDownloaded from \nValidation\nValidation was implemented using bootstrapping.19 20 29 This\nnon-parametric method, which estimates sampling distribu-\ntions of a predictor variable by resampling with replacement\nfrom the original sample, is, in effect, an impression of the\nvalidity of predictions in new but similar patients. For each\ngroup of 200 bootstrap samples, the model was refitted and\ntested against the observed sample in order to derive an estimate\nof the predictive accuracy and bias. This was used to select 148\n\u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 patients from the original cohort, one at a time with\nreplacement, 200 times over. For each of these 200 samples, the\nfollowing parameters were derived: (1) the b coefficients from\nCox proportional hazards models; (2) Somer\u2019s D rank correla-\ntion index and (3) an estimate of the slope shrinkage.19 The\napparent Somer\u2019s D (Dapp) was derived using stepwise Cox\nproportional analyses. The bootstrap-corrected performance of\nthe predictor equation, or \u2018\u2018optimism\u2019\u2019,20 was quantified by\nassessing the difference between Somer\u2019s D in the original\nsample (Dorig) and D in the bootstrap sample (Dboot). The\naverage optimism, termed O, was derived by repeating the\nabove steps 200 times over. The bootstrap-corrected perfor-\nmance of the original stepwise model, Dapp \u2013 O, is, effectively,\nan honest estimate of internal validity.20 Actual survival was\nplotted against apparent estimated survival and bootstrap-\ncorrected estimated survival.\nCalculation of the risk index\nThe risk prediction index was expressed as the absolute value of\nthe sum of the products of these variables and their b\ncoefficients (that is, weights) from the final stepwise multi-\nvariate Cox proportional hazards model, identified by Harrels\u2019s\nroutine19 20: S bixi = |b1x1+b2x2+\u2026+bnxn|, where x1, x2,\u2026xn are\nthe values for the variables and b1, b2,\u2026 bn are the coefficients\nfor each variable. For categorical variables, presence was\ncomputed as the b coefficient and absence as zero.\nUnivariate analyses\nUnivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed\nafter development and validation of the DSC index. These were\nundertaken in order to assess the relative strength of other\nvariables in relation to cardiovascular mortality.\nRESULTS\nThe characteristics of the study group are shown in table 1.\nThere were 20 cardiovascular deaths by one year and 28 by two\nyears. After a follow-up of 913 (967) days (median (interquartile\nrange) for events, there were 37 cardiovascular deaths. Of these,\n28 were due to pump failure, eight were sudden and one patient\nunderwent cardiac transplantation. Of the 48 patients with a\nposterolateral scar, 35 had a transmural scar and 12 had a non-\ntransmural scar. Scar volume in these 48 patients was 33.2%\n(18.5).\nDerivation and validation\nTable 2 shows model outputs for the variables included in the\nprediction model (DSC): Dyssynchrony, Scar location (postero-\nlateral) and Creatinine.

Scar burden (LR x2: 13.3)\nand CMR-LVEF (LRx2: 11.1) were also strong predictors (both\np,0.001). Among circulating markers, sodium and creatinine\nwere significant predictors (both p,0.01), uric acid only reached\nborderline significance (p = 0.0808) and haemoglobin failed to\nreach significance. Male gender was also a modest predictor\n(p = 0.0417). Age, NYHA class, QRS duration, atrial fibrillation,\ndiabetes or CABG failed to reach statistical significance. Similarly,\nuse of loop diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors\n(ACE)\/angiotensin-receptor blockers, b-blockers or spirinolactone\nfailed to emerge as predictors of cardiovascular mortality (data not\nshown). Although ischaemic aetiology did emerge as a significant\npredictor of cardiovascular mortality in univariate analysis,\naddition of scar burden to this model rendered aetiology non-\nsignificant (data not shown). The decision not to include\nischaemic aetiology in the multiple regression model was taken\nin view of its expected interaction with scar burden and scar\nlocation (non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy is associated with little\nor no scar). In addition, the diagnoses of ischaemic and non-\nischaemic cardiomyopathy were made on the basis of size,\ntransmurality and location of scar in the CMR scan.\nDISCUSSION\nOur findings have emerged in the context that there are,\nhitherto, no means of predicting mortality in patients under-\ngoing CRT. Our aim was to identify an index that could predict\ncardiovascular mortality after CRT on the basis of pre-implant\nvariables. The DSC index, which combines pre-implant\nmeasures of dyssynchrony and location of myocardial scar as\nwell as creatinine, is a novel, powerful predictor of cardiovas-\ncular mortality in patients treated with CRT. Compared to\npatients in the lowest risk stratum, cardiovascular mortality\nvalues in the intermediate and high-risk strata of the DSC index\nwere 11.1 and 30.5 times higher by the end of the follow-up\nperiod, respectively.\nThe variables from which the DSC is derived have previously\nbeen linked to a poor outcome after CRT. Of particular\nmechanistic relevance to CRT is scar burden and scar location.\nThis study confirms the findings of previous studies showing\nthat the presence of myocardial scar over the posterolateral LV\nwall is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular mortality.8 The\nprecise pathophysiological mechanism is still unclear, but\nseveral factors may contribute to this observation. First,\nmyocardial scars are not readily excitable.30 A posterolateral\nscar reduces the volume of excitable myocardium in the vicinity\nof the LV pacing stimulus and delays activation of potentially\nrecruitable myocardium, which is crucial for CRT.31 Second, a\nposterolateral scar also reduces the amount of myocardium\navailable for contraction in CRT, thereby leading to suboptimal\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier estimates of the\ntime to cardiovascular death. Patients\nwere stratified according to pre-implant\nDSC index. The event rate, number of\npatients in the DSC risk stratum and the\npercentage event rate are shown in\nbrackets. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95%\nconfidence intervals are also shown.\nFigure 2 Calibration of predictions of mortality after cardiac\nresynchronisation therapy.

In other words, our findings point towards a \u2018\u2018too much\ndyssnchrony is bad\u2019\u2019 paradigm, whereas echocardiographic\nstudies support an \u2018\u2018any degree of dyssynchrony is good\u2019\u2019\nparadigm of CRT. Our finding that \u2018\u2018too much dyssynchrony is\nbad\u2019\u2019 is, however, consistent with the finding that in non-paced\npatients with heart failure, dyssynchrony, assessed by tissue\nDoppler imaging, is a predictor of cardiac decompensation.21 A\nradionuclide radioscintigraphy study of patients with dilated\ncardiomyopathy has also shown that a dyssynchrony index was\nan independent predictor of major cardiac events, including\ncardiovascular death.22 Moreover, Bax et al33 recently found that\nbeyond a limit of dyssynchrony (a septal-to-posterior wall motion\ndelay of 100 ms), CRT does not result in reverse LV remodelling.\nThe \u2018\u2018too much dyssynchrony is bad\u2019\u2019 paradigm might be expected\nin view that dyssynchrony is inversely related to LVEF,6 and\npositively related to LV volumes6 and QRS duration.6 34 35\nTogether, these data suggest that the most damaged and worst\nfunctioning left ventricles gain the least benefit from CRT. In\nother words, that there is a maximum of treatable dysynchrony.\nOur findings are in contrast to those of the PROSPECT study,\nin which echocardiographic measures of dyssynchrony were\nshown to be of little additive value to QRS duration in\npredicting functional and LV volumetric changes after CRT.4\nProminent among the findings of this study were the very high\ncoefficients of variation for echocardiographic dyssynchrony\nmeasures, which were as high as 72%.4 Current technology,\ndegree of training standards and analytical methods do not\nallow incorporation of echocardiographic measures of dyssyn-\nchrony in a generalised setting, representing a significant\nlimitation for their widespread use.36 In contrast, the intra-\nobserver and inter-observer variabilities for CMR-TSI are as low\nas 3.01% and 8.84%, respectively,6 thereby providing the highest\naccuracy and lowest intra-observer and inter-observer variabil-\nities for a dyssynchrony measure.\nWe have also considered other non-invasive variables which\nhave previously been shown to be of prognostic value in patients\nwith heart failure treated7 8 and not treated10 26 27 with CRT. The\nemergence of plasma creatinine in the predictive model is not\nsurprising because renal impairment is a predictor of poor\noutcome in non-paced patients with heart failure.23\u201326 37 We have\nshown that the inverse relation between plasma creatinine and\nsurvival still holds in patients with heart failure undergoing CRT.\nClinical application\nCardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is becoming a key\ninvestigation in patients with cardiomyopathy, as it provides\ninformation on aetiology, ventricular function and prog-\nnosis.13 38 Myocardial tagging,39 40 strain-coding5 and velocity-\nencoding41 techniques are all capable of providing dyssynchrony\nmeasures. These techniques, however, are highly specialised, are\nnot routinely available in any centre and, more importantly,\nhave not been validated against mortality after CRT. In\ncontrast, the CMR technique that allows derivation of the\nDSC index involves a routine CMR-LGE scan, which is available\nin any CMR centre. With the emergence of software packages\nthat allow rapid assessment of myocardial scars and wall\nmotion, the DSC index can be easily quantified.\nFigure 3 Receiver-operator characteristic curves of the DSC index\nagainst cardiovascular mortality at 1 and 2 years, and at the end of the\nfollow-up period.

Therefore, the\nDSC index may not be generalisable to a population of\npatients treated with CRT-D. External validation of the DSC\nindex in a cohort of patients undergoing CRT-D would be\ndesirable. As a further limitation, the use of b-blockers and\nspironolactone were relatively low. While drug therapy failed\nto emerge as a predictor of cardiovascular mortality, we\ncannot discount the possibility that the relation between the\nDSC index and cardiovascular mortality might be influenced\nby more optimised medical therapy. On the other hand, in\nprospective randomised controlled trials, absence of b-blocking\nagents or spironolactone was not associated with a significant\nsurvival benefit.1\nThe DSC index may be useful in predicting the outcome of\nCRT, but a high DSC index should not be used to deny CRT to\npatients who satisfy current guideline criteria. As our study did\nnot include a control group, one cannot be certain the CRT-P\nled to a prognostic benefit. This, however, seems likely in view\nof the similarity between the prognostic risk profile of the\npresent cohort and that of the CRT-P arm of the CARE-HF\nstudy (fig 4).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study comprised patients with heart failure in NYHA class III\nand IV, such as those included in the CARE-HF study. We have\nfound that in such patients, the DSC index is a powerful risk-\nstratifier for cardiovascular mortality. Patients in the highest risk\nstratum were more than 30 times as likely to die from\ncardiovascular causes than those in the low risk stratum. These\nfindings are perhaps not surprising, as extreme dyssynchrony, a\nposterolateral location of scar and poor renal function have all been\nlinked to a poor outcome in patients with heart failure. The present\nstudy supports the use of a standard CMR-LGE in prospective CRT\ncandidates, in whom pre-implantation risk stratification may\ninfluence clinical management. Although this study did not include\npatients undergoing CRT-D, it seems unlikely that patients in the\nhighest DSC risk category, most of whom die of pump failure,\nwould derive a survival benefit from CRT-D. On this basis, the DSC\nindex may influence resource allocation.\nTable 3 Univariate Cox proportional hazard analyses of predictors of mortality\nb coefficient (95% CI) HR (95% CI) LR x2 p Value\nPosterolateral scar location 2.82 (1.94 to 3.70 16.8 (6.94 to 40.5) 58.6 ,0.0001\nCMR-TSI (ms) 0.015 (0.01 to 0.02) 1.01 (1.01 to 1.02) 25.5 ,0.0001\nScar burden (%) 0.03 (0.01 to 0.04) 1.03 (1.01 to 1.04) 13.3 0.0001\nCMR-LVEF (%) 20.06 (20.10 to 20.02) 0.94 (0.90 to 0.98) 11.1 0.0032\nSodium (mmol\/l) 20.13 (0.04 to 20.04) 0.88 (0.81 to 0.96) 8.2 0.0031\nCreatinine (mmol\/l) 0.01 (0.00 to 0.02) 1.01 (1.00 to 1.02) 7.92 0.0049\nTransmurality (transmural) 0.92 (0.26 to 1.58) 2.51 (1.29 to 4.84) 7.64 0.0057\nMale gender 0.95 (20.08 to 1.99) 2.59 (0.92 to 7.32) 4.15 0.0417\nUric acid (mmol\/l) 0.00 (20.00 to 0.00) 1.00 (1.00 to 1.00) 2.33 0.1265\nNYHA class 0.54 (20.17 to 1.21) 1.73 (0.84 to 3.37) 2.24 0.1343\nCABG 20.28 (0.18 to 20.62) 0.75 (0.53 to 1.08) 2.42 0.1196\nQRS duration (ms) 0.01 (20.00 to 0.02) 1.01 (1.00 to 1.02) 1.01 0.2202\nAge (years) 0.01 (0.02 to 20.01) 1.01 (0.98 to 1.05) 0.78 0.3765\nAtrial fibrillation 0.15 (20.23 to 0.49) 1.16 (0.80 to 1.63) 0.64 0.4220\nDiabetes mellitus 20.17 (20.55 to 0.28) 0.84 (0.57 to 1.33) 0.61 0.4324\nHaemoglobin (g\/dl) 20.02 (20.19 to 0.02) 0.98 (0.83 to 1.02) 0.51 0.4763\nVariables are listed in order of statistical significance and likelihood ratio x2 (LR x2).\nCABG, coronary artery bypass graft; CI, confidence interval; CMR-TSI, cardiovascular magnetic resonance tissue synchronisation\nindex; CMR-LVEF, cardiovascular magnetic resonance left ventricular ejection fraction; HR, hazard ratio; NYHA, New York Heart\nAssociation.\nFigure 4 Comparison of events in the\npresent cohort and in the CARE-HF study.\nQualitative comparison of Kaplan-Meier\nsurvival estimates for the combined\nendpoint of death from any cause or\nhospitalisations for major cardiovascular\nevents (MCE) for patients included in this\nstudy as well as those in the CRT-P and\nthe optimum medical treatment (OPT)\narms the CARE-HF study.
