So, can this\nnation rest easy? No. Based on extensive research by the\nAdvanced Institute of Management Research (AIM), it would\nappear that the agenda for keeping Britain competitive is a\ndemanding one. Six AIM authors report on what the UK needs\nto know. And do.\nIs the UK an innovative country? Sad to say (and formany years), the UK economy has underperformed interms of innovation. Research shows that Denmark,\nFinland, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, South\nKorea, Sweden, Switzerland and the US all spend more\nthan the UK on Research and Development as a\npercentage of GDP. The Competitiveness Index, produced\nby the World Economic Forum, ranks the UK sixth on a\nmore general measure of innovativeness.\nThe Advanced Institute of Management Research (AIM:\nwww.aimresearch.org) came into existence in 2002 to\nsustain, among other goals, a rigorous watch on UK\u2019s\ninnovation performance. This led to research projects\nlooking at innovation from a number of different\nperspectives and at different levels of activity. In\nparticular, AIM researchers tried to understand UK\u2019s\ninnovation performance within the context of a changing\nbusiness world. From all its work, AIM has pinpointed\nfour key ways that Britain could overtake its global\ncompetitors and achieve higher ranking. Quickly, Britain\nmust become far better than it is at:\n\u25cf Opening up innovation The country has to boost\ncollaboration across organizations and national borders.\nBritain already has one of the highest levels of\ninternational flows of investment; but, in other areas,\nsuch as collaboration between universities and the\nprivate sector \u2013 or with India and China, the UK has\nfurther to go.\n\u25cf Mastering higher-order innovation Britain needs a better\nunderstanding of the different forms of innovation\n(especially higher-order innovations, such as\nmanagement innovations). Business leaders need fresh\nways of looking at innovation in order to move their\ncompanies up the value chain. In particular, UK firms\nneed to adopt smarter innovation practices, leading to\nnovel business models and better ways of working.\n\u25cf Developing innovation networks To capitalize on its\nstrong science base, the UK should develop innovation\nnetworks around its leading research centres, which\nwould thus become innovation hubs. These innovation\nnetworks should also reach beyond the UK. In this way,\nthe UK could position itself at the centre of a global\ninnovation web. UK firms already invest heavily in R&D\nin other countries, especially the US. Rather than\nworrying about this practice, policymakers should\nrecognize the important role it plays in technology\ntransfer and knowledge spillovers into the UK. \n\u25cf Making the most of international firms in the UK\nForeign multinationals own large parts of the UK\neconomy (40 per cent of private sector companies), and\nthe trend toward foreign ownership is continuing.\nConcerns have been raised about the \u201chollowing out\u201d of\nthe UK economy, especially the ability of these foreign-\ncontrolled businesses to be innovative and\nentrepreneurial. AIM research suggests this concern is\nunfounded. There is evidence that foreign-owned\ncompanies are at least as innovative as locally owned\ncompanies. There is also evidence that UK firms can\nuse the local presence of foreign firms to learn from\ntheir superior technology.\nCompeting on knowledge\nThere is a thread that links the four measures advocated\nabove. AIM research suggests that one of the main drivers\nof differences in productivity is tied to knowledge.\nLearning is a competitive weapon. That is, both in terms\nof individual skills and competencies and in terms of the\nknowledge-based capabilities of firms, the UK needs to\nshift away from competing via lower costs to competing\nvia adding value. Put even more simply, Britain and its\nbusinesses need to expand their knowledge base.\nThe challenge now facing the UK is not simply to\ncreate more knowledge but to capture it in ways that have\na positive economic and social impact. Primarily, this\nmeans converting our knowledge base into economic\nvalue through commercial innovation. It also means\nrecognizing the changing nature of the global knowledge\neconomy. \nAttention is shifting from knowledge creation to\nknowledge flows, with the implication that trading\nknowledge may become as important in the 21st century\nas trading physical goods was in previous centuries. This\nrequires the UK\u2019s innovation infrastructure to become\nmore effective at identifying and capturing useful know-\nhow. In more ways than most people can imagine, the\nfate of the UK hinges on its ability to learn how to\ncompete on the basis of knowledge. That\u2019s why, for each\nof the four major AIM recommendations, leaders need to\nunderstand the actions that people in the UK can take,\nnow, to accelerate the nation\u2019s speed on the path to\nbecoming boldly innovative. \u2723\n\u00a9 2008 The Author   |   Journal compilation \u00a9 2008 London Business SchoolBusiness Strategy Review Spring 200876\nSp\nec\nia\nl r\nep\nor\nt\nInnovation has been traditionallyviewed by large companies as aclosed process. Whether it was\ninnovation involving the source code\nfor a new software product, the\nformula for a new drug or the designs\nfor a radically different motor car, the\nwatchwords were caution and\nsecrecy. With large financial\ninvestments and future profits at\nstake, commercial innovation, in\nparticular, typically occurred behind\nclosed doors. \nThis made sense in a world where\ncompetitive advantage was seen to\nreside in proprietary R&D, protected\nby patents and intellectual property\nlaw. Consequently, the exchange of\nideas remained in-house. Over the\nlast decade, however, this situation\nhas started to change. One major\ncatalyst has been the success of the\nopen source software movement,\nwhich freely publishes the source\ncode for new software projects on the\nInternet. Open source collaboration\ncan, and does, work. For example,\nthe Linux computer operating system,\ninvented by Linus Torvalds and\ndeveloped through the open source\nmodel, now offers an alternative to\nMicrosoft\u2019s Windows. \nThe open source approach is now\nbeing applied not only to the\ndevelopment of software but to an\nincreasingly wide range of products.\nIncreasingly, firms are adopting the\ncollaborative principles of what is\ncalled open innovation. As the head\nof innovation at the US consumer\ngoods company Procter & Gamble\nrecently explained: \u201cWe have a broad\nprogramme we call \u2018connect and\ndevelop\u2019. In the academic world, they\ncall it open innovation. We want to\nconnect internally \u2013 move\ntechnologies and ideas across our\nbusiness units internally \u2013 but we\nalso want to connect externally. This\nhas been a real source of innovation\nfor us.\u201d Open innovation at P&G now\naccounts for 35 per cent of the\ncompany\u2019s total innovations and\nmillions of dollars in revenue.\nExchanging knowledge\nThe potential of the Internet as a\nknowledge resource is huge. \u2192\ncomplex aerodynamic and other\nengineering products. And a growing\nset of tools \u2013 such as rapid\nprototyping, simulation and\ncomputer-aided design \u2013 help users\ninteract with professional designers.\nOf course, innovation is not\nconfined to manufactured products.\nIt also encompasses the huge range\nof service activities in both public\nand private sectors. Service\nbusinesses may not have a formal\nR&D department, but they do\nundertake related activities in order\nto deliver a stream of innovations.\nImportantly, the knowledge sets with\nwhich they work involve a much higher\nlevel of user insight and experience \u2013\nand thus their continuing\ncompetitiveness, especially in those\nIn 2001, for example, Eli Lilly\nand Company set up InnoCentive as \na matchmaking tool, connecting\nthose with scientific problems to\nthose able to offer solutions. Its\nstated aim is to \u201cuse the power of \nthe Internet to create and enhance\nopen-source scientific research and\ndevelopment (R&D).\u201d There are \nnow multiple sites offering a\nbrokering service, linking needs \nand means to create a global\nmarketplace for sharing ideas.\nInnoCentive CEO Darrel Carroll\nexplains: \u201cLilly hires a large number\nof extremely talented scientists from\naround the world, but like every\ncompany in its position, it can never\nhire all the scientists it needs. No\ncompany can.\u201d \nAnother increasingly common\nstrategy involves companies seeing\nusers not as passive consumers of\ninnovations, but rather as active\nplayers in the process. Their ideas\nand insights can provide the starting\npoint for very new directions and\ncreate new markets, products and\nservices. For example, the Danish toy\ncompany Lego has set up the Lego\nFactory website: users can design\ntheir own models online and then\nhave the ready-to-assemble sets sent\nto them. Lego\u2019s website is an\neffective way to capture ideas from\nits most advanced users that can\nthen be incorporated into mainstream\nproducts. Such a collaborative\napproach is now used for everything\nfrom T-shirts and surfboards to\nOf course, innovation is not confined to manufactured products.\nIt also encompasses the huge range of service activities in both\npublic and private sectors.\n\u00a9 2008 The Author   |   Journal compilation \u00a9 2008 London Business SchoolBusiness Strategy Review Spring 200878\n\u2192\nBusiness Strategy Review Spring 2008\u00a9 2008 The Author   |   Journal compilation \u00a9 2008 London Business School 79\nsectors which are internationally\ntraded, will depend on taking an\nopen approach to innovation.\nOpening minds\nUnderpinning the move to open\ninnovation is a growing recognition\nthat no single country or organization\ncan corner the market in new ideas.\nThe effect of open innovation is a\nfundamental change in the way that\norganizations create value. It involves\na willingness to seek out leading-\nedge research wherever it occurs and\nan acceptance that home-grown\nknowledge is less proprietary than\nwas once the case. \nThis favours the UK, which already\nhas one of the most open innovation\nsystems in the world. UK firms, for\nexample, are big investors in R&D\noverseas, especially in the US. In \nthe past, this has been viewed\nnegatively, with calls for UK firms to\ninvest their R&D budgets mainly\nwithin the UK. But in the context of \na global innovation system, investing\nin R&D outside the UK offers\nimportant benefits in terms of\ntechnology transfer and importing\nleading edge ideas.\nSimilarly, the fact that R&D carried\nout by foreign-owned multinationals\nrepresents almost a third of all R&D\nin the UK suggests that the UK is a\ngood innovation system to invest in.\nThis also points to the openness of\nthe UK\u2019s innovation infrastructure.\nAt the level of the UK economy as\na whole, AIM research has shown that\nthe large-scale market liberalization\nundertaken as part of EU integration\nand other pro-competitive reforms\nhas had a positive effect on\ninnovative activity and economic\nperformance. More open markets\nencourage firms to innovate in order\nto \u201cescape competition\u201d.\nAt the level of the individual firm,\nAIM research has examined the\nstrategic choices firms make to\ndevelop and commercialize new\nproduct ideas. This research\nemphasizes the importance of\ngaining access to external sources of\nideas, but it also shows that such\nexternal sourcing works best when\ndone in combination with a less\nproprietary attitude to knowledge\nprotection. Open innovation relies on\ntrust and reciprocity between\npartners. Unless a firm changes its\nmindset to reflect the need for such\nvalues, the necessary knowledge\nexchanges will not occur.\nIn terms of the UK science base,\nthere is much more to be done to\nencourage collaboration among firms\nand across academic institutions.\nAIM research shows that the UK\u2019s\nshare of internationally co-authored\npapers (an indication of scientific\ncollaboration) with newcomer\ncountries is relatively high, but well\nbelow US and Japanese levels. When\nit comes to collaboration with China\nand India, in particular, the trend\nfrom 1988 is downwards. In\ncollaboration with China, for\nexample, the UK has been overtaken\nby Germany and the group formed of\nSouth Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.\nCollaboration with India shows a\nsimilar pattern to that with China,\nbut with a more pronounced drop of\nthe UK\u2019s share.\nAnother AIM study focuses on the\ncommercial outputs from research-\ncouncil funded projects. Projects that\nlead to spin-off companies, licensing,\npatenting or consulting activities are\nmore likely to rise in higher-\nreputation universities; they are also\nmore likely to be led by less\nexperienced and more junior faculty.\nThis study highlights the difficulty of\ntrying to steer established research-\noriented faculty toward commercial\nprojects and underlines the\nimportance of developing a broader\nrange of outlooks and capabilities\namong researchers if the twin\nobjectives of high-quality research\nand commercial outcomes are to be\nobtained. \u2723\nSp\nec\nia\nl r\nep\nor\nt\nTelecommunications company BT\nhas a long history of technological\ninnovations with a total worldwide\nportfolio of 7,700 patents and\napplications. Deregulation,\nconvergence and fierce competition\nmade BT rethink its research and\ndevelopment (R&D) strategy by\n\u201cinnovating the way it innovates\u201d,\nin the words of BT\u2019s group chief\ntechnology officer, Matt Bross.\nBross believed that the company\u2019s\ninnovation efforts had to be more\ncommercially \u2013 rather than\ntechnologically \u2013 driven, with the\nentire research portfolio structured\naround business needs. With that\npurpose in mind, BT adopted an\nopen innovation model based\nmainly on two pillars. \nFirst, BT is actively managing \nits patent portfolio (for example,\nlicensing and spinning out new\nbusinesses) through NVP Brightstar,\na firm that specializes in taking\ntechnology projects out of BT as\nnew ventures. Second, BT is\nmoving toward a model where it\nleverages the power and speed of\nexternal partners to accelerate the\ncreation of new services. Bross\nreorganized BT\u2019s R&D function to\nenhance its ability to identify,\nunderstand, select from and\nconnect to the wealth of available\nexternal knowledge. In November\n2006, BT had scouting units in\nSilicon Valley, China and Japan, with\nthe objective of identifying global\nsources of innovation (product,\nservice, process, social) and seeding\nthem into the lines of business.\nOpen innovation at BT\nM\nas\nte\nri\nng\n h\nig\nhe\nr-\nor\nde\nr \nin\nn\nThere is an important distinction \nbetween the run-of-the-mill innovations \nin products and processes that all firms \nengage in and the higher order forms of \ninnovation (such as business model \ninnovation, discontinuous innovation and \nmanagement innovation) that very few \nhave mastered. UK firms need to find \nways of understanding and managing \nthese different forms of innovation. \nMany organizations around the world are \ncurrently experimenting with new \ninnovation practices. There is a great \nopportunity for UK firms to learn from \nand adopt new practices in this area to \ndevelop more sustainable sources of \nadvantage.\nC ritical to improving the UK\u2019sinnovation performance is abetter understanding of\ndifferent types of innovation. For\nmany firms, innovation is seen as\napplying narrowly to new product\ndevelopment or technological\nprogress, but this is an unduly\nconstraining point of view that\nrestricts a firm\u2019s ability to generate\nnew sources of competitive\nadvantage.\nTry to think of the different forms\nof innovation as a stack of\napproaches. At the bottom are\nrelatively incremental innovations in\nproducts or processes. So, for\nexample, the formulation of a product\nis altered slightly to create the new\nand improved version or a process is\nstreamlined to enhance efficiency;\nbut the fundamental approach and\ntechnology remain unchanged. These\nare the lower-order forms of\ninnovation, also called \u201csteady state\u201d\ninnovation. They are important; but\nbecause everyone is doing them and\ncan copy each other\u2019s advances fairly\nquickly, they are never a lasting\nsource of advantage.\nAt the top of the stack are the\nhigher-order forms of innovation that\ncan have a dramatic impact on a\nfirm\u2019s competitiveness if they are\neffective. One of AIM\u2019s key\ncontributions is to examine the\nnature of these higher-order\ninnovations and the managerial\nchallenges they present. Specifically,\nthe research looked at discontinuous\ninnovation and management\ninnovation.\nManaging discontinuous\ninnovation\nOccasionally, a disruptive event\noccurs that changes markets,\nindustries \u2013 even societies. A good\nexample is the advent of the Internet.\nSuch world-changing events give rise\nto a wave of discontinuous innovation\nacross many industries. This has a\ndestabilizing, or disruptive, effect for\nestablished firms.\nSuccessful well-managed\ncompanies thrive in mature markets\nby focusing on doing what they do\njust a little bit better (steady state\nSp\nec\nia\nl r\nep\nor\nt\ninnovation). Consequently, when a\ndisruptive event comes along, such\nas new technology or a regulatory\nchange, the successful company is\noften blindsided. It is just not very\ngood at the \u201cdoing it different\u201d type\nof innovation. The very attributes that\nmake it successful in stable\nconditions hinder its ability to detect\nor exploit the change. \nAIM research confirms that the\nability to manage innovation well\nduring steady-state periods and the\ntypes of routines employed can\nactually hinder a company\u2019s ability to\ndeal with innovation during\ndiscontinuous change. The\nconsequences of failing to take\nadvantage of such disruptive change\nare often severe. Eastman Kodak, for\nexample, struggled to cope with a\nshift to digital photography. Digital\nEquipment Corporation lost its way\nwhen the minicomputer was\nsuperseded by the personal computer\n(the company was ultimately sold to\nCompaq). Sectors that currently face\ndisruptive change include:\n\u25cf Pharmaceutical firms, in which \nthe dominant model of high\ninvestment in R&D (15\u201320 per\ncent of turnover) linked to the\nquest for blockbuster drugs is\ngiving way to uncertainty about\nnew technological direction (the\nbio-pharma challenge). This\ninvolves \u201clow end\u201d disruption from\ngeneric drugs, future market\ngrowth in low-income countries and\nnew business models around total\nhealthcare services rather than\nproduct delivery.\n\u25cf Telecoms firms, in which a\ncombination of technologies\naround VOIP (Voice Over Internet\nProtocol), convergence within\nInformation and Communication\nTechnology (ICT) and market\nfragmentation challenges service\nand delivery models.\n\u25cf Medical devices, in which\nproducers are facing shifts as in\npharmaceuticals from product\ndevelopment to service delivery.\n\u25cf Engineering companies, in which\ncompanies are facing challenges\naround new business models that\ninvolve offering \u2018\u2018total\u2019\u2019 solutions\nbased on a wide range of services\nwrapped around a core product.\nRolls Royce, for example, now\nderives over 50% of its revenue\nfrom the services surrounding its\naeronautical engines.\n\u25cf Digital media and entertainment\ncompanies, in which firms are\nstraining in a sector that is\nfragmenting rapidly, due to the\nemergence of Web 2.0. The\nboundaries between consumers\nand creators are disappearing\n(contrast YouTube with a traditional\nTV firm; recent data suggests that\nYouTube has 100 million viewings\nper day, with 65,000 new videos\nbeing uploaded daily).\nHow can established firms cope\nwith and thrive on disruptive change?\nAIM research examined this issue\nfrom several different perspectives.\nOne AIM study focused on the need\nfor firms to adopt \u201csmarter innovation\npractices\u201d. Steady-state innovation\npractices are fine for equilibrium\nconditions or non-complex\nenvironments, but they break down\nwhen used to try and deal with high\nunpredictability (\u201cthe edge of\nchaos\u201d). In fact, the approaches\nneeded to cope with these two\ndifferent types of conditions are\ndifferent in almost every respect, as\nthe related chart illustrates. \nThrough a detailed study of\norganizations such as BT, the BBC,\nLego, and P&G, the research suggests\na number of broad findings: \nFirst, not all firms \u201cget it\u201d as far as\ndiscontinuous innovation is concerned.\nMany still work inside a comfort\nzone, defining the \u201cbox\u201d which they\npretend to want to get out of. But,\nactually, the decision and resource\nallocation structures limit the\nexploration space and leave the firm\nvulnerable to new entrants rewriting\nthe business model or opening up\ncompletely new markets created by\nradical technological shifts.\nSecond, UK firms need to develop\nnew mechanisms to let go of the\npast, reframe the present and explore\nmultiple rather than single futures.\nThis requires them to find new ways\nto encourage (or at least tolerate)\nchallenges to the industry orthodoxy,\nincluding the views held by senior\nmanagement. The danger, otherwise,\nis that any radical alternative vision\nof the future will be killed by the\ncorporate immune system. There is\nan important role here for input from\noutsiders with a different frame of\nreference.\nThird, firms need access to\n\u201cgatekeepers\u201d, science partners such\nas universities, consultants and trade\nassociations, who provide expertise\nand act as neutral knowledge brokers\nacross the network. By collaborating\nwith those at the forefront of new\ntechnologies, firms can better\nidentify disruptive change and,\ncrucially, use that knowledge to\ncreate commercial applications. \nBusiness Strategy Review Spring 2008\u00a9 2008 The Author   |   Journal compilation \u00a9 2008 London Business School 81\nType 1  Innovation organization for\nsteady state\nType 2  Innovation organization for \ndiscontinuous conditions\nOperates within a mental framework \nbased on a clear and accepted set of \nrules of the game\nNo clear rules; these emerge over time\nHigh tolerance for ambiguity\nStrategies path dependent Path independent, emergent, probe \nand learn\nClear selection environment Fuzzy, emergent selection environment\nSelection and resource allocation linked \nto clear trajectories and criteria for fit\nRisk taking, multiple parallel bets, \ntolerance of (fast) failure\nOperating routines refined and stable\nStrong ties and knowledge flows along \nclear channels\nWeak ties and peripheral vision \nimportant\nOperating patterns emergent \nand \u201cfuzzy\u201d\nFigure 1.\n\u2192\n\u00a9 2008 The Author   |   Journal compilation \u00a9 2008 London Business SchoolBusiness Strategy Review Spring 200882\nOne way of coming to grips with\nthis challenge is for firms to learn\ntogether, sharing experiences and re-\nflecting on what has and hasn\u2019t worked\nand looking at new ideas and models.\nThis is the basic idea behind the AIM\nDiscontinuous Innovation Laboratory\n(www.innovation-lab.org) that involves\nnetworks of around 50 firms in the\nUK, Germany and Denmark.\nAnother AIM study focused on the\nstructures firms put in place to\nhandle discontinuous changes; this\nresearch suggests the goal is to\nbecome \u201cambidextrous\u201d. There are\ntwo major ways to do this:\nUnderwrite corporate venturing\nCorporate venture units exist to nurture\nand develop start-up businesses for\ntheir parent company. Many were\nestablished in the late 1990s, during\nthe boom years of the technology\nbubble. Not only did these operations\nface all the classic challenges of start-\nups \u2013 inexperienced management,\nsecuring access to funding, attracting\ncustomers \u2013 they also had to weather a\nmeltdown in the technology sector\nthat left most corporate parents\nwondering why they had got involved\nin corporate venturing in the first\nplace. \nSo how has corporate venturing\nfared in the post-dotcom world? Is it\nstill a viable and exciting approach to\nnew business development in large\ncorporations? Some venture units\nhave been shut down, but many have\nsurvived the downturn \u2013 and a few\nnew ones have been started up. More\ninterestingly, the survivors have\nadapted their strategies and\norganizational models significantly to\ncope with the more risk-averse\nbusiness environment we are now\nliving in. AIM research shows that the\nsurvivors have:\n\u25cf Created enough autonomy to make\ntheir own investment decisions\nrather than allowing corporate\nmanagement to second-guess their\ndecisions\n\u25cf Made good use of external partners,\nespecially venture capitalists, who\ncan provide access to new ideas\nand help them learn how to\ndevelop new businesses\n\u25cf Ensured top-level support at all\ntimes; it takes longer to make a\nventure unit successful than the\ntypical tenure of a CEO, so it pays\nto have more than one highly\nplaced ally\n\u25cf Looked for ways of adding value back\nto the mainstream businesses, for\nexample, by building new ventures\nthat they can benefit from or that\nthey see as strategically important\nBuild an innovation culture The\nsecond approach involves firms trying\nto foster a culture that is supportive of\ninnovation. Specifically, this means\nwrestling with two diametrically\nopposed organizational qualities \u2013\nadaptability and alignment.\nAdaptability is about focusing on the\nfuture. It is the ability to respond to\nchange, to be nimble, to progress.\nAlignment is about maximizing the\npresent, leveraging existing ideas and\nexploiting markets. \nOrganizations that successfully\nbalance the two qualities are called\nambidextrous. The key to success is\nto empower individuals to make the\nchoices in their day-to-day work that\nallow them to find the balance. Car\nmanufacturer Renault and software\nfirm Oracle both rate high for ambi-\ndexterity. Renault achieved it by\nbuilding a performance context around\nexisting social support. Oracle built a\nperformance context first, then looked\nfor ways of building support and \ntrust across the organization. Despite\ntheir differences, Renault and Oracle\nboth have a clear and simple set \nof priorities. Oracle employees\nemphasized the role of goal setting,\nindividual performance appraisal and\nrisk management as key priorities.\nWith Renault employees, capital\nallocation, recruiting and vision were\nimportant. Selecting focal elements is\ncritical, as they have to fit the needs\nof the organization. However, the\nconsistency with which they are\napplied, and the number of employees\nimpacted, is even more important. \nLeveraging management\ninnovation\nA second key form of higher-order\ninnovation is management\ninnovation, defined as a marked\ndeparture from traditional\nmanagement principles, processes\nand practices or a departure from\ncustomary organizational forms that\nsignificantly alters the way the work\nof management is performed.\nManagement innovation has the\npower to transform the way\norganizations operate. For example,\nconsider how our ability to manage\nthe consistency of manufacturing\nprocesses has evolved: from Ford\u2019s\nintroduction of the moving assembly\nline in 1913 and Western Electric\u2019s\ninvention of statistical quality control\nin 1924; through the quality\nrevolution begun by Toyota and other\nJapanese companies in the period\nfollowing WWII; and on to more\nrecent innovations such as the ISO\nquality standard and Motorola\u2019s Six\nSigma methodology. These advances\nare as much about innovations in \nthe philosophy and tools by which\nmanufacturing processes are managed\nas the processes themselves.\n\u201cIf you look over a hundred years\nof industrial history, typically it is\nmanagement innovation that has\nallowed organizations to reach new\nperformance thresholds \u2013 more than\nany other kind of innovation,\u201d\nobserves Gary Hamel, visiting\nprofessor at London Business School,\nand co-founder of MLab (which\nreceived seed funding from AIM).\n\u201cThe challenge is to instil\nmanagement innovation into\norganizations.\u201d \nThe trouble is that, while many\nfirms have developed established\nprocesses for managing the lower-\norder forms of innovation, few (if any)\nhave dedicated themselves to the\npursuit of management innovation.\nInstead, when it occurs, management\ninnovation is typically ad hoc and\nserendipitous rather than systematic\nand planned. \nAIM researchers have undertaken\nthree studies that begin to identify\nsome of the key drivers of\nmanagement innovation. The first\nstudy focused on ground-breaking\ninnovations and the conditions that\nled to their emergence. Key factors\nincluded:\n\u2192\nSp\nec\nia\nl r\nep\nor\nt\nBusiness Strategy Review Spring 2008\u00a9 2008 The Author   |   Journal compilation \u00a9 2008 London Business School 83\n\u25cf A questioning, problem-solving\nculture Rather than adopt well-\nproven approaches, individuals in\ninnovative companies sought to\ndevelop their own unique solutions.\n\u25cf Use of analogies from different\nenvironments In order to get outside\nthe box of traditional thinking,\ninnovative companies imported\nideas from entirely different\nplaces. The Danish hearing aid\ncompany, Oticon, for example,\nbuilt its innovative \u201cspaghetti\norganization\u201d on the principles of\nthe scouting movement.\n\u25cf A capacity for low-risk\nexperimentation Because\nmanagement innovation is hard to\nprove in advance, it needs to be\ntested in low-cost experimental\nways. P&G applies its standard\ntesting process, used for new\ndetergents and foods, to its\nmanagement innovations as well. \n\u25cf Selective use of external change\nagents to explore new ideas\nInnovative firms make selective use\nof outsiders such as academics and\nconsultants who fulfil three roles:\nproviding a source of new ideas\nand analogies, acting as a\nsounding board for emerging\ninnovations and helping to validate\nwhat is accomplished.\nA second study focused on the\nconditions under which firms\nintroduce management practices that\nare new to the firm (typically adapted\nfrom other settings). This study\nhighlights the importance of a\nperceived crisis or \u201cburning platform\u201d\naround which people can be\nmobilized to seek out new practices\nas well as the importance of insights\nfrom many different external sources\nto identify the appropriate solutions.\nA third AIM study explored the\nrelationship between management\npractices and competitiveness.\nManagement practice data was\ncollected from 732 medium-sized\nmanufacturing firms in the US,\nFrance, Germany and the UK. These\nmeasures of managerial practice were\nlinked with firm-level productivity,\nprofitability, sales growth and survival\nrates. Management practices also\ndisplay significant cross-country\ndifferences with US firms on average\nbetter managed than European firms.\nAll three studies, if examined in\ndetail, can help leaders focus on\nmanagerial innovation and ways to\nadvance their organizations. \u2723 S\npe\nci\nal\n r\nep\nor\nt\nDe\nve\nlo\npi\nng\n in\nno\nva\ntio\nn \nne\nt\nThe UK\u2019s science base could be better \nharnessed by developing innovation \nnetworks around the top research \ncentres and universities. Importantly, \nsuch networks are not only about \nstimulating high tech start-ups but also \nabout providing the space within which a \nvariety of knowledge exchange activities \ncan occur to support existing \nbusinesses. Clearly much effort has \nalready gone into this but, as innovation \nopens up, the importance of networks \nwill grow. Global innovation networks \ncan also support knowledge transfer \u2013 \nbut they depend critically on brokers \nand gatekeepers to enable the flow. UK \nfirms already use their R&D investment \nin other countries, especially the US, as \nan important way to access new \ntechnology and import know-how into \nthe UK. International links will be \nincreasingly important to create \nnetworks that span the globe, including \nthe rapidly developing economies of \nBrazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC).\nTo improve its innovationperformance, the UK needs toget better at exploiting its\nknowledge base, especially its strong\nscience base. AIM research confirms\nthe importance of networks for\nexploiting know-how; they play a\nmajor role in the innovation process.\nMoreover, a certain type of high-value\nnetwork is far more effective at\nsparking innovation. We call these\nInnovation Networks or I-Works, which\nhave the following characteristics: \n\u25cf Highly diverse Network partners are\ndrawn from a wide variety of\ndisciplines and backgrounds and\nencourage exchange across idea\nsystems.\n\u25cf Third party \u201cgatekeepers\u201d These\ninclude science partners such as\nuniversities, but also consultants\nand trade associations, which\nprovide access to expertise and act\nas knowledge brokers across the\nnetwork.\n\u25cf Financial leverage Access to\ninvestors \u2013 via business angels,\nventure capital firms and corporate\nventuring \u2013 spreads the risk of\ninnovation and provides market\nintelligence.\n\u25cf Proactively managed Participants\nregard the network itself as a\nvaluable asset and actively manage\nit to reap the innovation benefits.\nFor firms, access to I-Works offers\na potent source of new ideas and\ncompetitive advantage. Fostering\nrelationships with such networks\nshould be seen by firms as a critical\ncapability. Here\u2019s how to get started.\nEncourage clusters\nAIM research also examined the role\nplayed by clusters \u2013 geographic con-\ncentrations of expertise and economic\nactivity \u2013 in stimulating innovation. \nAt their most powerful, clusters \u2013\nwhich consist of networks of\nspecialized skills and knowledge \u2013\ncan dominate an entire global industry.\nThe Hollywood film industry, Detroit\nautomotive industry and the financial\ndistrict in London\u2019s Square Mile are\nfamous examples. But the economic\nrole model in recent years has been\nthe technology cluster of Silicon\nSp\nec\nia\nl r\nep\nor\nt\nValley centred on Stanford University.\nIt has been argued that creating\nclusters around leading UK research\nuniversities could improve the\nexploitation of the UK\u2019s science base.\nCreate magnets for R&D\nAIM research investigated the extent\nto which foreign business R&D\nactivity in the UK was located close\nto high-quality university research\ndepartments. One study compared\nthe concentration of R&D labs with\nthe results of the 2001 Research\nAssessment Exercise (RAE). The\nfindings show that R&D activity\nclusters around the more highly rated\nuniversity research departments. \nThis is particularly strong in the\npharmaceuticals and chemicals\nsectors. A postcode area with a\nchemistry department rated 5 or 5*\nby the RAE has on average twice as\nmany pharmaceutical R&D labs as an\narea with no chemistry department.\nThe results are even stronger for\nforeign-owned labs, consistent with\ntechnology sourcing by foreign\nmultinationals. \nIn some sectors, the results are not\nlimited to highly rated research\ndepartments. Postcode areas with a\nmaterials science department rated 4\nor below have on average more\nforeign-owned labs in machinery,\naerospace and motor vehicles. These\nresults confirm the role of world-class\ncentres of research in attracting\nforeign R&D in some sectors. But\nthey also point to the potential role of\nmore applied research centres. The\nmost pronounced effects were found\nin pharmaceuticals \u2013 where two-way\nflows of R&D investment and\nspecialization were observed.\nSuccessful networks or clusters\ninclude a wide variety of firms and\nresearch centres. AIM research on\nthree UK biotech regions shows how\nresearch establishments,\nmanufacturers and a variety of\nservice providers each contribute in\ndifferent ways to the innovative\noutput of a cluster. It is important\nthat the UK continues to encourage\nand develop both pure science and\nthe commercial enterprises that bring\nthese ideas to market. \nPotentially, clusters are important\npillars of UK competitiveness, yet\nthey are still something of an enigma.\nTheoretically it should be possible to\ncreate conditions that encourage\ncluster development. Yet attempts to\nfoster their formation have had mixed\nresults. AIM research indicates that\npolicy support should be tailored to\nthe specific needs of individual\nclusters and be designed with the\ncomplexity and lifecycle stages of\nclusters in mind.\nEnable learning networks\nAnother area where networks can\nhelp is in diffusing existing\nknowledge \u2013 essentially reaching the\nlong tail of less experienced firms\nwith knowledge that, while not new to\nthe world, is new to them and whose\napplication can enhance productivity.\nOne AIM study has been looking at\nhow such mechanisms can accelerate\nthe take-up of innovative practices,\nfor example, in the use of new\nmanufacturing techniques. \nWork in South Africa, for example,\nindicates that collaboration in learning\nnetworks significantly enhanced the\nability of automotive component\nmanufacturers to absorb and deploy\nnew manufacturing knowledge and\ncatch up with the world frontier in\nterms of productivity indicators such as\nquality, cost and delivery performance.\nLearning networks can be configured\nin a variety of ways. Another option is\nto organize across supply chains to\nprovide the framework for sharing and\ntransferring learning about innovative\npractices. A third option is to\nmobilize at sector level \u2013 as has been\nthe case with the Industry Forum\napproach in the UK automotive\nsector. \nBuild new networks \nAIM research also examined the\nspecific strategies firms can use to\ngain access to new networks of\npartners, customers and suppliers,\nespecially when faced with disruptive\nthreats of the type discussed earlier.\nThis research makes a critical\ndistinction between the strategies\nused to identify new partners and the\nstrategies used to build relationships\nwith partners once they have been\nidentified. It highlights a number of\nspecific approaches that have been\nsuccessful for such firms as BT,\nGlaxoSmithKline, the BBC,\nAstraZeneca, and Rio Tinto:\n\u25cf Where the challenges in finding\nand forming relationships are\nrelatively low, approach potential\nnew partners directly, and structure\nthe relationship to minimize\nwhatever obstacles separate you\n\u25cf Where the challenge is mostly\naround finding new partners,\napproach them through boundary\nspanners or scouts who specialize\nin such activities, and work hard at\nbuilding the capability to absorb\ninsights from these partners\n\u25cf Where the challenge is mostly\naround forming new relationships\nwith prospective partners, focus on\nthe higher-order purpose that\ntranscends ideological differences\nand try to identify crossover\nindividuals who can link the\ndifferent parties \n\u25cf Where the challenge involves\nfinding and forming new networks,\nbe prepared to work with specialist\nand independent network builders\nto bridge the gap and look for ways\nof gradually breaking down barriers\nto enable the approaches identified\nabove to work \nOnce new relationships have been\nformed, in order to turn them into\nhigh-performing networks, it is\nnecessary to keep the network fresh\nand engaged, build trust and\nreciprocity across the network,\nunderstand your own position in the\nnetwork and learn when to let go of\nold relationships. \nPolicy can also play an important\nrole in encouraging the establishment\nand development of networks. AIM\nResearch has explored innovations in\ndesign principles and build processes\nin the construction of luxury yachts.\nUK-based independent design houses\nhave played a major role in these, but\nthe majority of construction takes\nplace elsewhere. The DTI and British\nMarine Federation have combined to\nestablish the Superyacht UK\ninitiative in order to promote UK\nproducers internationally. \u2723\nBusiness Strategy Review Spring 2008\u00a9 2008 The Author   |   Journal compilation \u00a9 2008 London Business School 85\nThe challenge of increasing theinnovative capacity of the UKis complicated by the fact that\napproximately 40 per cent of\ncompanies in the private sector have\nnon-UK based parent companies.\nMajor UK businesses such as\nPowergen, Thames Water and\nNycomed Amersham are fully owned\nsubsidiaries of foreign multinationals;\nand entire industry sectors, including\ncar manufacturing and financial\nservices, are dominated by foreign\ncompanies. Foreign ownership has\nobvious benefits: it provides UK\ncompanies with greater access to\ncapital, cutting-edge technology and\nnew managerial practices. However,\nforeign ownership comes at a price: a\nloss of autonomy and influence for\nsenior executives and a concern that\nimportant decisions will not be made\nin the best interests of the UK\neconomy.\nAIM research has addressed these\nconcerns in two very different ways.\nOne study focused on the strategic\nissues facing subsidiary operations in\nthe UK, with a view to understanding\nhow much influence subsidiary\nmanagers have over their own destiny\nand the extent to which they are able\nto drive new ideas and innovation\nprojects. The research confirmed that\nUK subsidiary managers typically\nhave low degrees of autonomy\n(compared, for example, to subsidiary\nmanagers in Canada or Australia who\nare further away from their corporate\nheadquarters). However, the research\nalso indicated that low autonomy was\nnot necessarily a bad thing. Rather,\nthe key factors that made a\ndifference in terms of upgrading the\nsubsidiary\u2019s activities and influence\nwere initiative-taking strategies\naimed at acting on opportunities in\nthe local market and profile-building\nstrategies aimed at raising awareness\nback at the home office of what the\nsubsidiary company was good at. \nAIM researchers also looked at the\nbenefits of innovation networks that\ncross national borders for foreign-\nowned companies. Research\nexamined the effects of UK PLC\ninvesting in R&D in other countries.\nIn particular, it considered theM\nak\nin\ng \nth\ne \nm\nos\nt o\nf i\nnt\ner\nna\nLarge parts of the UK economy are \nowned by foreign multinationals, and the \ntrend towards foreign ownership is \ncontinuing. This has prompted concerns \nabout the \u201chollowing out\u201d of the UK \neconomy and the ability of \nforeign-controlled businesses to be \ninnovative and entrepreneurial. AIM \nresearch suggests this concern is not \nwell founded: there is evidence that \nforeign-owned companies are at least as \ninnovative as locally owned companies. \nMoreover, there are a number of clear \nstrategies open to managers of \nforeign-owned businesses who want to \nchart their own destiny. \u2192\nSp\nec\nia\nl r\nep\nor\nt\nAIM\u2019s research on how to boost\ninnovation in Britain was extensive;\nhowever, AIM\u2019s recommendations\non how to start can be quickly\nsummarized:\nEmbrace open innovation\nGlobalization presents many new\nchallenges. Policies that focus on\nincreasing domestic activity, and\nparticularly encouraging firms to\nrelocate R&D away from internation-\nal centres of excellence, may come\nat a cost of isolating these firms\nfrom international markets and\nknowledge systems. In addition,\nfocusing policy on larger firms risks\nfurther strengthening the position\nof large dominant firms. \nChanges in the economic\nenvironment now favour greater\nflexibility. It is important to focus\non policies that facilitate entry-\nand-exit and experimentation \u2013 and\nallow successful entrants to grow\nand challenge the market position\nof incumbent firms. The sorts of\ninstitutional reforms that matter\nare complementary policies\npromoting flexibility, higher\neducation, well-functioning\nfinancial markets, flexible labour\nmarkets that encourage the\nacquisition of general skills and\ngreater cooperation between the\nscience base and private sector.\nAt a national level, competition\nin R&D is not between countries; it\nis between research teams that\noperate within and across\ncountries. It is vital, therefore, to\nensure that conditions in the UK\nare conducive to research teams\nsucceeding here and to UK firms\nsucceeding in research that is\ncarried out in other parts of the\nworld. The UK government\u2019s anti-\nprotectionist stance is clearly one\nthat helps promote greater\ninternational collaboration.\nMake mastering higher-order\ninnovation a priority It is critical\nthat UK firms prepare for\ndiscontinuous shifts. Specifically,\nUK managers need to find ways to:\n\u25cf Broaden their vision to look out\nfor possible discontinuity\nsignals; this can be achieved by\nsetting up networks and\nbroadening the scope of\nresearch.\n\u25cf Develop alternative strategic\nframes by using different\nbusiness models to examine\ndiscontinuities. For example,\nShell has built on its extensive\nscenario planning experience\nthrough a programme called\nGamechanger, which seeks to\nidentify forces that will change\nthe rules of the game.\n\u25cf Extend resource allocation,\nwhich is critical when a firm is\nexperiencing discontinuities.\nEngage with international\ninnovation networks, including\nclusters AIM research suggests that\npolicy makers should consider a\nrange of measures to stimulate the\nformation of innovation networks.\nThese include:\n\u25cf Establishing centres for\ncollaboration in priority areas\n\u25cf Fostering the diversity of\npartners, for example, actively\npromoting local professional\nnetworking and pump-priming\nfunding for foreign research\ncollaboration\n\u25cf Establishing more network\nintermediaries in universities and\ncolleges\n\u25cf Strengthening the role of\nbusiness-angel networks on a\nlocal (sub-regional) level\n\u25cf Encouraging syndicated invest-\nments to improve the quality and\nthe quantity of investment in\nentrepreneurial firms\nPolicies in this area (to develop\nclusters, but also for innovation in\ngeneral) need to have a long time\nframe (decades rather than years).\nPolicy should be consistent and\nclear in its direction. There have\nbeen a lot of changes to policy\nrecently, following various\ninnovation reviews. An important\nprinciple in this (as in other) areas\nis that policy shouldn\u2019t change \ntoo frequently; too much change\nwill lead to uncertainty and will\nmean that policy is less effective \nat encouraging firms to change\ntheir behaviour. (Investing in\ninnovation is a long-term goal; if\nfirms don\u2019t know what future policy\nwill be, then they will be less likely\nto invest.)\nOur research also indicates that\nfirms should:\n\u25cf Proactively manage their\nnetworks and networking\nactivities \n\u25cf Actively seek out and participate\nin I-Works \n\u25cf Collaborate with third parties\nsuch as trade associations,\nconsultants and science partners\nwho can act as neutral network\nbrokers \n\u25cf Recognize that venture finance\nnetworks offer more than just\nfunding\nThe first step, however, is for senior\nmanagers and policy makers in \nthe UK to realize that networking \nis a critical capability for UK\norganizations and should be\nmanaged as such. Companies \nneed to manage knowledge\nspillover, but they also need to\nrecognize that, in the global\neconomy, no company can afford \nto be an island. The failure to\ndevelop networking capability is a\nself-limiting strategy.\nInnovating in Britain: the way ahead\nBusiness Strategy Review Spring 2008\u00a9 2008 The Author   |   Journal compilation \u00a9 2008 London Business School 87\n\u00a9 2008 The Author   |   Journal compilation \u00a9 2008 London Business SchoolBusiness Strategy Review Spring 200888\neffects of technology transfer from\nthe US into the UK, often referred to\nas technology sourcing or spillovers.\nUK firms operating abroad access\nnew ideas and technologies and can\ntransmit these back to the UK.\nPrevious research has emphasized\nthe importance of technology\nsourcing as a method of gaining\naccess to foreign know-how. Firms\ncan tap into leading edge knowledge,\nfor example, by setting up overseas\nR&D labs close to clusters of\ninnovative activity and using this\nknowledge to improve productivity in\ntheir home operations. AIM research\nexamined whether technology\nsourcing in the US had a beneficial\nimpact on UK firms during the\n1990s. The findings suggest that UK\nfirms with R&D activity located in the\nUS benefited more from US R&D\nspillovers than firms that were not\nlocated there. \nKnowledge flows are clearly\nimportant to innovation, especially\nwhen they involve technology transfer\nfrom one country to another. Another\nAIM research project looked at how\ninformation and know-how flows\naround organizations. The study\ncompared knowledge sharing in\nmultinational companies and multi-\nplant firms. The findings suggest that\nmultinationals are more likely to\nshare information with other parts of\nthe business than comparable multi-\nplant firms. These information flows\nare strongly correlated with reported\ninnovation activity. This result\nsupports the idea that knowledge\ntransfer is an important factor in\nexplaining the competitive advantage\nof multinationals. \nFirms that export or, better still,\nare actually part of a multinational\nenterprise tend to have higher\nproductivity than their purely\ndomestic counterparts. Gaining a\nbetter understanding of this\ncorrelation is a very active area for\ncurrent research. AIM research\nsuggests that one of the main drivers\nof differences in productivity is\ndifferences in knowledge. The AIM\nresearch looked at several thousand\nUK firms covering all industries from\n1994 through 2000. For each firm,\nthe study examined multiple detailed\nmeasures of knowledge outputs,\nknowledge investments and sources\nof existing knowledge. The findings\nindicate that globally engaged firms\ninnovate more. But this is not simply\nbecause they use more researchers; it\nis also because they learn more from\nmore suppliers and customers,\nuniversities and other network\ncontacts. The relative importance of\nknowledge sources also appears to\nvary with the type of innovation.\nThere is also evidence that this sort\nof knowledge brought by\nmultinational firms then spills over to\nlocal firms. This suggests that\nproviding incentives to encourage\nmultinationals to come to a host\ncountry (for example, by offering\nsubsidies as many countries do) can\nbe an effective strategy. But the\nresearch also suggests that the\nsubsidies currently paid are, in some\ncases, too high.\nNo time to run away\nSince the 1980s, the UK economy\nhas undergone a dramatic\ntransformation. Huge swathes of\nindustry have been stripped from the\npublic sector and privatized. Trade\nunion power has diminished, and\npreviously protected industries have\nbeen deregulated. As a result, the UK\nis among the most market-oriented\nand business-friendly economies in\nthe world.\nThese changes have successfully\nencouraged growth in the UK. Yet,\ndespite the improvements, the UK\neconomy continues to underperform\nrelative to other developed nations on\nmany key measures. National\nproductivity and prosperity have\nimproved in absolute terms but still\nobstinately lag those of direct rivals,\nespecially the US.\nThe market reforms of the 1980s\nstimulated growth but were\ninsufficient to close the productivity\ngap with other developed nations.\nMoreover, the world has now moved\non. The rise of India and China and\nother lower-cost economies means\nthat competing on cost is no longer a\nviable strategy for firms in the UK.\nIndeed, with the increasing\ncommitment by those countries to\nR&D investment and to education\nand training, the basis of\ninternational competition has shifted\nfirmly to knowledge. Clearly, as\nglobalization expands the competitive\nnature of the marketplace, learning\nhow to innovate in new ways is\ncentral to national progress.\nThe UK\u2019s Chancellor of the\nExchequer, Alistair Darling, put it \nthis way in a 2007 speech: \u201cThe\nanswer is not running away from\nglobalization. It\u2019s investing in\ninnovation, design and training to\nhelp our skilled workforces provide \nan unanswerable argument for\ncontinued investment in the UK.\u201d \u2723\nResources\nL.
