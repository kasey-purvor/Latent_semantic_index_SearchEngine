INTRODUCTION\nIt is remarkable that 40 years after the quark model was\nfirst applied to the problem of baryon resonances [1] it is\nstill not well established whether three constituent quarks\nare the minimal effective degrees of freedom or whether a\nquark-diquark dynamics, where a pair of quarks is \u2018\u2018fro-\nzen\u2019\u2019 into a ground state, suffices. Indeed, the vast literature\ninspired by the apparent discovery of a metastable \u2018\u2018penta-\nquark\u2019\u2019 baryon in 2003 [2] showed both how little the\nstrong dynamics of quarks is understood and raised re-\nnewed speculation about the role and existence of highly\ncorrelated diquarks [3,4]. Furthermore, an acceptable de-\nscription of baryon resonance spectroscopy has been pro-\nposed based on a quark-diquark picture [5].\nThe relative coordinate between the two quarks forming\nthe diquark is constrained to be in the l\u0002 \u0002 0 state. (We use\nthe symbols \u0002, \u0003 as in Ref [6] to denote the antisymmetric\nand symmetric two-body substates within a three-body\nwavefunction). In such a case, the familiar and established\n\u0004SU\u00056\u0006; LP\u0007 multiplets \u000456; LP\u0007 and \u000470; LP\u0007 occur, but it is\nimpossible to form \u0004SU\u00056\u0006; LP\u0007 correlations, \u000420; LP\u0007 [7].\nWithin a qqq dynamics, where both \u0003 and \u0002 spatial\noscillators can be excited, the spectrum is richer and such\n20 states can occur.\nWhereas \u000456; LP\u0007 and \u000470; LP\u0007 excitations are well es-\ntablished, the search for \u000420; LP\u0007 has been largely ignored,\nprimarily because they cannot be excited by mesons or\nphotons from a 56 nucleon. This is because photons and q \u0003q\nbeams transform under SU(6) as 35, which with the SU(6)\nforbidden transition 56 \b 35 =! 20 causes them to de-\ncouple from nucleons in naive SU(6) [7,8].\nThe purpose of this paper is to re-examine the assump-\ntions underlying resonance production in the quark model.\nThis will lead us to a selection rule, that appears to have\nbeen overlooked in the literature, and also to identify\ncircumstances where 20 states can be excited.\nA standard and phenomenologically successful assump-\ntion common to a large number of papers in the quark\nmodel is that photon transitions are additive in the con-\nstituent quarks [9\u201311]. This assumption also underlies\nmodels of hadronic production and decay in the sense\nthat when q1q2q3 ! \u0004q1q2qi\u0007 \t \u0004q3 \u0003qi\u0007, the quark pair\nq1q2 are effectively spectators and only q3 is involved in\ndriving the transition. Such approximations lead to well\nknown selection rules, which have proved useful in classi-\nfying resonances [11]. We adopt this approximation as a\nfirst step and show that within it there is a further selection\nrule that appears to have been overlooked in the literature.\nWe shall refer to this as the \u2018\u2018\u0001 selection rule\u2019\u2019 and show\nhow it may help classify N\u0001 resonances.\nThe above \u2018\u2018spectator-hypothesis\u2019\u2019 for transition ampli-\ntudes will be violated by the spin-dependent forces that act\nbetween pairs of quarks and break SU(6), such as those\ngenerating the N-\u0004 mass gap. For example, when the\nnucleon is in an electromagnetic field, gauge invariance\nand the presence of such two-body forces imply that there\noccur diagrams where the photon interacts with quark\nnumber 3, say, and the exchange force acts between quarks\n3 and 1 or 2. Thus electromagnetic interactions can transfer\nmomentum to both \u0003 and \u0002 oscillators, which both spoils\nthe spectator-hypothesis and opens the possibility of excit-\ning 20-plets.\nAs a specific and quantifiable example we shall assume\nthese spin-dependent forces arise from gluon exchange in\nQCD. This has considerable quantitative support [12] and\nalso has been shown to induce mixings, including 70-plet\nconfigurations, into the nucleon wavefunction [13]. Taking\ninto account that the N-\u0004 mass gap of 300 MeV is on the\nscale of \u0001QCD, the resulting mixing effects can be sizeable.\nWhereas 56 \b 35 =! 20, the coupling 70 \b 35 ! 20 is al-\nlowed. Consequently the SU(6) breaking that induces 70\ncorrelations into the nucleon enables the excitation of\n20-plets by photons and mesons. Interestingly, we shall\n*Electronic address: Qiang.Zhao@surrey.ac.uk\n\u2020Electronic address: F.Close@physics.ox.ac.uk\nPHYSICAL REVIEW D 74, 094014 (2006)\n1550-7998=2006=74(9)=094014(6) 094014-1 \u00a9 2006 The American Physical Society\nsee that the \u0001 selection rule still manifests itself in N\u0001 !\nK\u0001 transitions even though the SU(6) symmetry is broken.\nThis phenomenon will be useful for clarifying the excita-\ntion of 20-plets in the N\u0001 spectrum.\nIn the next section we first present the \u2018\u2018\u0001 selection\nrule\u2019\u2019. We then show how QCD-generated wavefunction\nmixing allows production of 20-plets. We formulate these\nideas in a QCD quark model [13] though the qualitative\nresults should be more generally true. In the final section\nwe quantify these effects and discuss their application to\nN\u0001 classification.\nII. THE MODEL\nFor reference, we specify our nomenclature. The stan-\ndard SU\u00056\u0006 \b O\u00053\u0006 wavefunction can be constructed from\nthree fundamental representations of group S3:\n SU \u00056\u0006: 6 \b 6 \b 6 \u0002 56s \t 70\u0002 \t 70\u0003 \t 20a; (1)\nwhere the subscripts denote the corresponding S3 basis for\neach representation, and the bold numbers denote the\ndimension of the corresponding representation. The spin-\nflavor wavefunctions can be expressed as jN6; 2S\t1N3i,\nwhere N6 ( \u0002 56, 70 or 20) and N3 ( \u0002 8, 10, or 1) denote\nthe SU(6) and SU(3) representation and S stands for the\ntotal spin. The SU\u00056\u0006 \b O\u00053\u0006 (symmetric) wavefunction is\n jSU\u00056\u0006 \b O\u00053\u0006i \u0002 jN6; 2S\t1N3; N; L; Ji; (2)\nwhere explicit expressions follow the convention of Isgur\nand Karl [14\u201316].\nThe basic rules follow from application of the Pauli\nexclusion principle to baryon wavefunctions together\nwith an empirically well tested assumption that electro-\nweak and strong decays are dominated by single quark\ntransitions where the remaining two quarks, or diquark, are\npassive spectators [6]. In particular, selection rules for\nspecific processes can resolve the underlying dynamics.\nFor example, the Moorhouse selection rule [17] states that\ntransition amplitudes for \u0001p to all resonances of represen-\ntation \u000470; 48\u0007, such as D15\u00051675\u0006, must be zero due to the\nvanishing transition matrix element for the charge operator.\nSuch correlations also lead to a \u2018\u2018\u0001 selection rule\u2019\u2019,\nwhich appears to have been overlooked in the literature.\nIt states that N\u0001 in \u000470; 48\u0007 decouple from \u0001K and \u0001K\u0001\nchannels. This follows because the [ud] in the \u0001 has S \u0002 0\nand in the spectator approximation, the strangeness emis-\nsions in N\u0001 ! \u0001K or \u0001K\u0001, the spectator [ud] in the N\u0001\nmust also be in S\u0004ud\u0007 \u0002 0, whereby such transitions for the\nN\u0001 of \u000470; 48\u0007 with S\u0004ud\u0007 \u0002 1 are forbidden.\nNote that the \u0001 selection rule applies to both proton and\nneutron resonances of \u000470; 48\u0007, in contrast to the\nMoorhouse selection rule, which applies only to the proton.\nThe nearest that we can find to this in the literature is that\n\u0001\u0001\u000470; 48\u0007 =! \u0003KN [18]. While the associated zero in\nN\u0001\u000470; 48\u0007 ! K\u0001 is implicit in work that has calculated\nthe couplings of baryon resonances [19], the source and\ngenerality of the rule does not seem to have been noted\n[20].\nIII. APPLICATION TO N\u0001 SPECTRUM\nAn immediate application of the rules is to the\nD15\u00051675\u0006, which is in \u000470; 48\u0007. According to the\nMoorhouse selection rule, the amplitudes for \u0001p! D15\nshould vanish. However, the experimental values are not\nzero, though they are small. Nonzero amplitudes arise from\nQCD mixings induced by single gluon exchange in the\nphysical nucleon [13]. The effective interaction\n \nHFB \u0002 2\u0004s3mimj\n\u0001\n8\u0005\n3\nSi \n Sj\u00063\u0005rij\u0006\n\t 1\nr3ij\n\u0002\n3\u0005Si \n rij\u0006\u0005Sj \n rij\u0006\nr2ij\n\u0003 Si \n Sj\n\u0003\u0004\n(3)\ninduces significant mixings between the 28 and 48 in the 56\nand 70 [16] and the nucleon wavefunction becomes [13]\n jNi \u0002 0:90j2SSi \u0003 0:34j2SS0 i \u0003 0:27j2SMi \u0003 0:06j4DMi;\n(4)\nwhere subscripts, S and M, refer to the spatial symmetry in\nthe S and D-wave states for the nucleon internal wave-\nfunction. Thus, the O\u0005\u0004s\u0006 admixtures at N \u0002 2 comprise a\n34% in amplitude excited 56 and 27% 70 each with L \u0002 0\nand 6% 70 with L \u0002 2. The 70 admixture quantitatively\nagrees with the most recent data [21] for the \u0001p! D15\namplitudes, neutron charge radius and D05 ! \u0003KN [13].\nThe results assume that mixing effects in the D15 are\nnegligible relative to those for the nucleon [13]: this is\nbecause there is no \u000470; 28;LP \u0002 1\u0003\u0007 state available for\nmixing with the D15, and the nearest J \u0002 5=2 state with\nnegative parity is over 500 MeV more massive at N \u0002 3.\nWithin this O\u0005\u0004s\u0006 analysis, such mixing is negligible:\ntransitions from the large components of the nucleon to\nsmall in D15 have \u0004N \u0002 3. The leading O\u0005\u0004s\u0006 amplitude\nfor \u0001p! D15 is dominantly driven by the small compo-\nnents in the nucleon and the large component in the D15\n[15] for which \u0004N \u0002 1.\nThis violation of the Moorhouse selection rule supports\nthe hypothesis of QCD mixing in the wavefunction of the\nN. The \u0001 selection rule also remains robust, in the context\nof the diquark model, as admixtures of [ud] with spin one,\nwhich would violate it, are only expected at most to be\n20% in amplitude [22], to be compared with 27% for the\nnucleon in Eq. (4). Therefore, we expect the \u0001 selection\nrule to be at least as good as the Moorhouse rule even at\nO\u0005\u0004s\u0006. Thus decays such as D15 ! K\u0001 will effectively\nstill vanish relative to K\u0002; for the D15\u00051675\u0006 the phase\nspace inhibits a clean test but the ratio of branching ratios\nQIANG ZHAO AND FRANK E.

Secondly,\nfor \u0001n! D15, where the Moorhouse selection rule does\nnot apply, the amplitudes are significantly large and con-\nsistent with experiment [21]. However, due to the \u0001 selec-\ntion rule, the D015 ! K0\u0001 which makes the search for the\nD15 signals in \u0001N ! K\u0001 interesting. An upper limit of\nB:R: < 1% is set by the PDG [21] which in part may be due\nto the limited phase space; a measure of the ratio of\nbranching ratios for K\u0001:K\u0002 would be useful. The\nF17\u00051990\u0006, which is the only F17 with N \u0002 2, is an ideal\ncandidate for such a test, which may be used in disentan-\ngling the assignments of the positive parity N\u0001 at the N \u0002\n2 level.\nThe QCD admixture of \u000470; 28; 2; 0; 1=2\u0007 in the nucleon\nwavefunction enables the excitation of 20-plets. There has\nbeen considerable discussion as to whether the attractive\nforces of QCD can cluster [ud] in color \u00033 so tightly as to\nmake an effective bosonic \u2018\u2018diquark\u2019\u2019 with mass compa-\nrable to that of an isolated quark. Comparison of masses of\nN\u0001\u0005u\u0004ud\u0007\u0006 and mesons u \u0003d with L \u000b 1 support this hy-\npothesis of a tight correlation, at least for excited states\n[5,23]. If the quark-diquark dynamics is absolute, then\nSU\u00056\u0006 \b O\u00053\u0006 multiplets such as \u000420; 1\t\u0007 cannot occur.\nThe spatial wavefunction for 20 involves both \u0002 and \u0003\ndegrees of freedom; but for an unexcited diquark, the \u0002\noscillator is frozen. Therefore, experimental evidence for\nthe excitations of the 20 plets can distinguish between\nthese prescriptions.\nPauli symmetry requires an antisymmetric spatial wave-\nfunction for a 20 e.g. for the lowest state \u000420; 1\t\u0007\n \na\n211\u0005\u0001;\u0002\u0006 \u0002\n\u0005\u0005\u0005\n2\np \u0005\u0002\t\u0003z \u0003 \u0003\t\u0002z\u0006 \u0004\n5\nh\n\u00053=2\ne\u0003\u00042h\u0005\u00012\t\u0002 2\u0006=2; (5)\nwhere \u0002\f \r \u000e\u0005\u0002x \f i\u0002y\u0006=\n\u0005\u0005\u0005\n2\np\nand \u0003\f \r \u000e\u0005\u0003x \f\ni\u0003y\u0006=\n\u0005\u0005\u0005\n2\np\n, and hence both \u0002 and \u0003 degrees of freedom\nhave to be excited.

PHYSICAL REVIEW D 74, 094014 (2006)\n094014-3\nare consistent with M1 transitions in ratio \u00033:2 as for the\nnucleons [9,10,21]. The mass splitting of the N\u00051440\u0006 \u0003\n\u0004\u00051660\u0006 is consistent with the hyperfine splitting.\nFor the \u000456; 2\t\u0007 the F37\u00051950\u0006 is uniquely assigned. The\nhyperfine mass splitting naturally associates the F15\u00051680\u0006\nas a partner; this is further confirmed by its photoproduc-\ntion amplitudes, which satisfy selection rules from both\nproton and neutron targets [9,10]. The P13\u00051720\u0006 is prima\nfacie associated with the F15\u00051680\u0006 but the photoproduc-\ntion amplitudes do not easily fit: the helicity 3=2 amplitude\nof the P13 is predicted to be one-half that of the F15, which\ndoes not fit well with the data [21]. The overall message\nfrom the 56 is that the constituent quark degrees of freedom\nare manifested at N \u0002 2 even though N\u0005 couplings are\nstrong as evidenced by \u0005T \u0010 350 MeV for P11\u00051440\u0006. This\nsets the challenge of assessing the situation for the rest of\nthe N \u0002 2 levels.\nOnly three P11 states are expected at N \u0002 2 if the\n20-plets cannot be excited. As to assigning these states:\n(i) The P11\u00051440\u0006 has already been assigned to 56; (ii) the\nP11 of \u000470; 48; 2\t\u0007 is expected to be heavier [6,16] and the\nsignals for F17\u00051990\u0006, F15\u00052000\u0006, P13\u00051900\u0006 and P11\u00052100\u0006\n[21] lead to a plausible assignment of these four in\n\u000470; 48; 2; 2; J\u0007; (iii) this leaves P11\u00051710\u0006 a natural candi-\ndate for \u000470; 28; 2; 0; 1=2\u0007. Nonetheless, there are still states\nof \u000470; 28; 2; 2; J\u0007 missing, and another P13 and F15 are\nneeded.\nWithin the approximations that excitation and decays\nare dominated by single quark transition, and that there is\nno mixing among the 56 and 70 basis states, the assign-\nments of P13 and F15 can be determined. The Moorhouse\nand \u0001 selection rules give the following filters for these\nstates: P13\u00054N\u0006 in \u000470; 0\t\u0007 decouples from K\u0001 and \u0001p but\ncouples to \u0001n. This contrasts with P13\u00052N\u0006 in either of\n\u000470; 2\t\u0007 or \u000456; 2\t\u0007 which couple to all three channels. The\nhelicity 3=2 amplitude of F15 in either of the \u000470; 2\t\u0007 or\n\u000456; 2\t\u0007 couples to photons with amplitude that is twice the\nsize of its P13 counterparts.\nTable II shows the photoproduction amplitudes ex-\npected. The P11\u00051710\u0006 fits with \u000470; 28; 2; 0; 1=2\u0007 due to\nthe large error bars, however neither of the\nP13\u00051710=1900\u0006 fit easily with being pure 56 or 70 states.\nWhen the QCD mixing effects are included the agreement\nimproves, in that small couplings of 4N states to \u0001p are\npredicted, in accord with data. However, the implication is\nthe added complexity that an additional P11 and P13 cor-\nrelation in \u000420; 1\t\u0007 is allowed. Most immediately this\nprevents associating the P11\u00051710\u0006 as \u000470; 0\t\u0007 simply on\nthe grounds of elimination of alternative possibilities. Thus\nwe now consider what are the theoretical signals and what\ndoes experiment currently say.\nQualitatively one anticipates P13\u00054N\u0006 having a small but\nnonzero coupling to \u0001p, the \u0001n being larger while the K\u0001\ndecay is still forbidden. For the 20 states P11;13\u00052N\u0006 both\n\u0001p and \u0001n amplitudes will be small and of similar magni-\ntude. However, mixing with their counterparts in 56 and 70\nmay be expected. In Table II, we list the helicity ampli-\ntudes for the P11\u00051710\u0006, P13\u00051720\u0006 and P13\u00051900\u0006 with all\nthe possible quark model assignments and the mixing\nangles from Eq. (4). The amplitudes for the P11 and P13\nof \u000420; 28; 2; 1; J\u0007 are the same order of magnitude as the\nMoorhouse-violating \u0001p! D15\u00051675\u0006 in Table I. For the\nP11\u00051710\u0006 all three possible configurations have ampli-\ntudes compatible with experimental data. For P13\u00051720\u0006,\nassignment in either \u000456; 28; 2\t\u0007 or \u000470; 28; 2\t\u0007 signifi-\ncantly overestimates the data [27,28] for Ap1=2 if it is a\npure state. Table II shows that the presence of 20 cannot\nbe ignored, should be included in searches for so-called\n\u2018\u2018missing resonances\u2019\u2019, and that a possible mixture of the\n20-plets may lead to significant corrections to the results\nbased on the conventional 56 and 70.\nAs a benchmark for advancing understanding we pro-\npose the following scenario, as a challenge for experiment:\ncan one eliminate the extreme possibility that P11\u00051710\u0006\nand P13\u00051720\u0006 are consistent with being in 20 configura-\ntions? There are already qualitative indications that they\nare not simply 56 or 70. Their hadronic decays differ\nnoticeably from their sibling P11\u00051440\u0006: compared with\nthe P11\u00051440\u0006 in 56 for which \u0005T \u0010 350 MeV with a\nstrong coupling to N\u0005, their total widths are \u0010100 MeV,\nwith N\u0005 forming only a small part of this.\nConsider now the phenomenology were these states in\n20. As 20 =! 56 \b 35, whereas 20 ! 70 \b 35 is allowed,\ndecay to N\u0005 will be allowed only through the 70 admix-\nTABLE II.

(4), this\nimplies that N\u0005 widths will be suppressed by an order of\nmagnitude relative to allowed widths such as from 56 or 70\ninitial states. Decays 20 ! N\u0001\u000570\u0006 \t \u0005! N\u0005\u0005 or N\b\u0005\ncan occur in leading order when phase space allows. These\nresults make the P11\u00051710\u0006 and P13\u00051720\u0006 extremely inter-\nesting as not only are their total widths significantly less\nthan the P11\u00051440\u0006 but the dominant modes for P11\u00051710\u0006\nand P13\u00051720\u0006 are to N\u0005\u0005, which allows a possible\ncascade decay of 20 ! N\u0001\u000570\u0006\u0005! N\u0005\u0005. In parti-\ncular, B:R:P13\u00051720\u0006!N\u0005\u0005 \u0010 70% could contain significant\nN\u0001\u000570\u0006\u0005; present partial wave analysis has not included\nthis possibility [29]. For P11\u000520\u0006 the S-wave decay P11 !\nS11\u0005 is expected to be a dominant two-body decay; hence\nwe urge a search for P11 ! N\b\u0005. Decays to 56\tM\n(where M denotes a meson) will occur through mixing,\nas for photoproduction, and so K\u0001 may be expected at a\nfew percent in branching ratio. In general we advocate that\npartical wave analyses of N\u0005\u0005 allow for the possible\npresence of N\u0001\u000570\u0006\u0005.\nIn order to classify these states, we advocate that partial\nwave analysis quantifies the couplings toN\u0001\u000570\u0006\u0005 and also\nincludes data on K\u0001 and\/or K\u0001\u0001 relative to K\u0002 as the \u0001\nselection rule can then be brought to bear. The \u0001 selection\nrule is useful for classifying the P11 and P13 in either\n\u000456; 28\u0007 and \u000470; 28\u0007, or \u000470; 48\u0007 and \u000420; 28\u0007, by looking\nat their decays into K\u0001 and\/or K\u0001\u0001. The Moorhouse\nselection rule can distinguish \u000470; 48\u0007 and \u000420; 28\u0007 since\nthe \u000470; 48\u0007 will be suppressed in \u0001p but sizeable in \u0001n,\nwhile the \u000420; 28\u0007 will be suppressed in both. The \u000470; 48\u0007\ndecays to K\u0001 will be suppressed relative to K\u0002 for both\ncharged and neutral N\u0001. J= ! \u0003p\t N\u0001 is a further probe\nof N\u0001 assignments, which accesses 56 in leading order and\n70 via mixing while 20 is forbidden. Hence for example\nJ= ! \u0003p\t \u0005P11:P13\u0006 probes the 56 and 70 content of\nthese states. Combined with our selection rule this identi-\nfies J= ! \u0003p\t K\u0001 as a channel that selects the 56 con-\ntent of the P11 and P13.\nIn summary, with interest in N\u0001 with masses above\n2 GeV coming into focus at Jefferson Laboratory and\naccessible at BEPC with high statistic J= ! \u0003p\t N\u0001,\nthis new selection rule should be useful for classifying\nbaryon resonances and interpreting \u0001N ! K\u0001, K\u0001\u0001, K\u0002\nand K\u0001\u0002 [30,31]. A coherent study of these channels may\nprovide evidence on the dynamics of diquark correlations\nand the presence of 20-plets, which have hitherto been\nlargely ignored.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to G.
