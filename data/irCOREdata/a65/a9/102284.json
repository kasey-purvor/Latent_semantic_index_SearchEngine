INTRODUCTION\nIn III-V-based dilute nitride materials, the high electro-\nnegativity of the nitrogen atoms substituting for the larger\nanion in the host matrix \u0001e.g., arsenic, antimony\u0002 leads to the\nformation of a highly localized band of states above the\nconduction-band minimum \u0001CBM\u0002. For dilute nitrogen con-\ncentrations, an interaction between these localized states and\nthe extended states of the conduction band leads to a reduc-\ntion of the fundamental band gap. This interaction is de-\nscribed both by the phenomenological approach of the band\nanticrossing \u0001BAC\u0002 model1 and by complementary detailed\nband structure calculations \u0001see, for instance, Ref. 2\u0002. These\nmodels have been successfully used both to explain and to\npredict the observed band structure of several dilute nitride\nalloys such as GaNAs, GaInNAs, and InNP.3 Generally, ef-\nforts have tended to focus on GaInNAs due to its potential\nuse in commercially important near-infrared applications\nsuch as telecommunications. Although interest in material\nsystems capable of emitting and\/or detecting at midinfrared\nwavelengths has grown steadily in recent years, due largely\nto the relevance of such wavelengths to molecular gas\nsensing applications, the study of suitable narrow gap\nsemiconductor-based dilute nitride alloys, such as InNAs and\nGaNSb, remains in its infancy.4,5\nGiven the well-known proclivity of the InAs host matrix\ntoward degenerate n-type doping, it is reasonable to expect\nthat band-filling effects will play a role in InNAs.4 Indeed,\nthe n-type conductivity of InNAs has been demonstrated pre-\nviously by Hall effect measurements of epilayer material\ngrown on semi-insulating GaAs substrates.6,7 In the presence\nof degenerate electron concentrations, optical characteriza-\ntion techniques that probe the absorption edge are generally\nincapable of resolving transitions between band edge states.\nGenerally, the Moss-Burstein shift \u0001band filling\u0002 tends to\ndominate measured spectra, leading to a blueshift of the\nabsorption edge with respect to the band gap. Such effects\nhave, indeed, proven extremely problematic in previous at-\ntempts to measure band gap reduction directly in InNAs us-\ning absorption spectroscopy, with large blueshifts being ob-\nserved rather than any redshift.6\u20139 The Moss-Burstein shifts\nwere \u201csubtracted\u201d during analysis to infer a net redshift in\nband gap.7\u20139 An unambiguous redshift of the absorption edge\nof InNAs alloys with increasing nitrogen content has been\nseen only in one previous study.10\nIn a previous preliminary study, we used photolumines-\ncence \u0001PL\u0002 spectroscopy to investigate the nitrogen-induced\nband gap reduction in InNAs samples containing nitrogen\npercentages \u0001N\u0002 of 1.0% and 2.2% at temperatures between\n77 and 300 K.4 Rather than probing the absorption edge, PL\nspectroscopy measures the light emitted by a recombining\npopulation of thermalized carriers. Band-to-band PL emis-\nsion, thus, originates predominantly from transitions between\nstates close to the band edges, making PL techniques less\nsensitive to the effects of degenerate doping. We were, there-\nfore, able to observe an unambiguous nitrogen-induced band\ngap reduction in the two InNAs alloys.4 Here, PL and PL\u2013\nlineshape analyses are employed to probe the optical proper-\nties of a more comprehensive set of InNAs epilayers over an\nextended temperature range of 15\u2013300 K.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 76, 075209 \u00012007\u0002\n1098-0121\/2007\/76\u00017\u0002\/075209\u00019\u0002 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society075209-1\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe InNxAs1\u2212x epilayers studied were grown pseudomor-\nphically to a thickness of 300 nm on Zn-doped p-type\nInAs\u0001001\u0002 substrates by molecular beam epitaxy \u0001MBE\u0002 us-\ning a turbo-pumped Vacuum Generators V80 system\nequipped with an Oxford Applied Research HD25 rf plasma\nnitrogen source. The substrate temperature was within the\nrange 350\u2013400 \u00b0C for the growth of all the InNAs samples.\nA 300-nm-thick InAs epilayer was also grown using a sub-\nstrate temperature of 460 \u00b0C. The amount of nitrogen incor-\nporated in the different films was varied by tuning the plasma\npower and nitrogen gas pressure. The nitrogen content in the\nInNAs layers was determined by high-resolution x-ray dif-\nfraction \u0001XRD\u0002 of the symmetric 004 reflection. The XRD\ncurves from the InNAs layers are shown in Fig. 1. The sepa-\nration between the substrate and epilayer diffraction peaks\nindicates the change in lattice constant in the epilayer due to\nnitrogen incorporation, which, via Vegard\u2019s law, gives the\nnitrogen content, as indicated in Fig. 1.\nSpectral measurements of the PL emission from each\nsample were made at several temperatures between 15 and\n300 K. The samples were mounted on the cold finger of a\nCryophysics closed-cycle helium cryostat. Although the\nquartz glass cryostat window is not ideal for midinfrared\napplications, steps were taken to ensure its long wavelength\ncutoff did not adversely affect the measured spectra. Correc-\ntions were made for both window response and atmospheric\nabsorption during data analysis. A mechanically chopped,\ndiode-pumped neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser,\noutputting \u0003100 mW at a wavelength of 1064 nm, was used\nas the excitation source. Hence, states well above the\nconduction-band edge are populated in the studied materials.\nThe PL emission was spectrally resolved using a Bomem\nfast-scanning Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and\ndetected by a liquid-nitrogen-cooled InSb detector coupled to\na lock-in amplifier. Since the maximum fringe modulation\nfrequency of the Bomem \u0001arising from the mirror scanning\nmotion\u0002 was approximately 3.3 kHz, it was necessary to\nchop the laser at a relatively high frequency of \u000320 kHz.\nThe diameter of the laser spot at the sample position was\napproximately 1 mm, which corresponds to a power density\nof \u000310 W cm\u22122.\nIII. RESULTS\nIt can clearly be seen in Fig. 2 that the low temperature\nPL emission shifts steadily and unambiguously to lower en-\nergy as the epilayer nitrogen content is increased. As shown\nin the first two frames of Fig. 3, for those samples with\nmoderate N \u0001i.e., 0.5% and 1.0%\u0002, a non-Varshni-like evolu-\ntion of the PL peak energy is observed with increasing tem-\nperature; i.e., on heating from low temperature, the PL peak\ninitially shifts toward higher energies before slowing and\neventually reversing its direction toward lower energies. This\nso-called S-shaped temperature dependence is a signature be-\nhavior of dilute nitride materials and has been observed in\nseveral such semiconductor alloys.11,12\nTo understand the origin of the S-shaped temperature de-\npendence, one must consider the local environment of the\nsubstitutional nitrogen atoms in the lattice. For low N, and to\na first approximation, interactions between the sparsely\npopulated substitutional nitrogen atoms are negligible \u0001i.e.,\nthere is no significant overlap of their electronic wave func-\ntions\u0002. Within the framework of the BAC model, the interac-\ntion between the localized band of isolated nitrogen states,\nwhose energies EN\n0 are measured relative to the valence band\nmaximum \u0001VBM\u0002, and the extended band of unperturbed\nhost conduction states, with energies EM\n0 \u0001k\u0002 also relative to\nthe VBM, may then be described by the following 2\u00012\nmatrix:\nFIG. 1.

The eigenvalues\nE can then be found by equating the determinant of the\nabove matrix to zero, giving the following quadratic solu-\ntions:\nE\u00b1\u0001k\u0002 =\n\u0006EN\n0 + EM\u0001k\u0002\u0007 \u00b1 \b\u0006EN\n0\n\u2212 EM\u0001k\u0002\u00072 + 4x\u00022\t1\/2\n2\n, \u00012\u0002\nwhere the two conduction subbands E\n\u2212\n\u0001k\u0002 and E+\u0001k\u0002 are\nsuch that E\n\u2212\n\u0001k=0\u0002\u0004EM\u0001k=0\u0002 and E+\u0001k=0\u0002\u0005EN\n0\n. Then, be-\ncause E\n\u2212\n\u0001k=0\u0002 represents the new effective CBM, the \u0001red-\nshifted\u0002 band gap is redefined as the energy gap between the\nVBM and E\n\u2212\n\u0001k=0\u0002.\nAs more nitrogen atoms are added to the lattice there is an\nincreased probability of two or more being bonded to the\nsame indium atom, so that there is significant overlap of their\nelectronic wave functions, leading to the formation of nitro-\ngen \u201ccomplexes.\u201d There are a large number of unique com-\nplex configurations available in the ternary tetrahedral lattice\nof a III-N-V semiconductor, each of which has a different\nself-energy lower than EN\n0 \u0006and crucially, therefore, closer to\nbeing in resonance with EM\u0001k=0\u0002\u0007. BAC model-type inter-\nactions between these nitrogen complexes and EM\u0001k\u0002, thus,\nform an array of localized states below E\n\u2212\n\u0001k=0\u0002, which we\nshall refer to as \u201cBAC states.\u201d A quantitative analysis of the\nformation of such BAC states in GaNAs has been published\nby Lindsay and O\u2019Reilly, where an approach referred to as\nthe linear combination of isolated nitrogen states \u0001LCINS\u0002\nmodel was used.13 In that work, it was suggested that, for\nN\u00045.0%, there is a linear evolution of the average nitrogen\nstate energy EN as N is increased, so that EN\n0 in Eq. \u00012\u0002 can be\nreplaced by EN=EN\n0\n\u2212\u0006x, where \u0006 is a positive constant. Al-\nthough a similarly thorough quantitative analysis does not\nyet exist for InNAs, one is encouraged by the structural simi-\nlarities between the GaAs and InAs host lattices to assume a\nsimilar evolution of EN as a function of N, so that EN\n0 in Eq.\n\u00012\u0002 can also be replaced by EN=EN\n0\n\u2212\u0006x.\nConsider now the temperature dependence of the PL\nemission spectrum that might result from the band structure\ndescribed above on heating from, say, absolute zero: at very\nlow temperatures, it is expected that there should be a sig-\nnificant below-band-gap contribution from the recombination\nof electrons trapped in the BAC states. On heating, however,\nthermal excitation of these trapped electrons into the conduc-\ntion band should gradually reduce the below-band-gap re-\ncombination, thereby shifting the PL emission peak to higher\nenergy, closer to the actual band gap energy. This behavior,\nthus, contributes a \u201cnon-Varshni\u201d component to the tempera-\nture dependence of the peak emission energy. The normal\nVarshni-like decrease of the \u0001III-V\u0002 semiconductor band gap\nwith temperature14 will compete with this non-Varshni com-\nponent as temperature is raised, but at low temperatures, the\nweak redshift due to the former will be outweighed by the\nblueshift due to the latter. However, while the rate of the\nredshift increases progressively with further heating, that of\nthe blueshift will decrease due to the exponential drop in the\noccupancy of the BAC states. Hence, in InNAs, the rate of\nthe initial blueshift of the PL emission peak energy with\nincreasing temperature should first slow down before halting\nand eventually giving way to a redshift.\nThe preceding discussion, thus, provides a qualitative un-\nderstanding of the mechanism responsible for the S-shaped\nvariation \u0001or bowing\u0002 of the PL peak energy as a function of\ntemperature exhibited by the N=0.5% and N=1.0% samples\n\u0001as shown in the first two panels of Fig. 3\u0002. From Fig. 3, we\nalso note that increasing N from 0.5% to 1.0% enhances the\nS-shaped bowing. This observation is also consistent with\nthe above qualitative argument, since adding nitrogen will\nincrease the number of nitrogen complexes, which in turn\nwill increase the density of the BAC states, and, hence, the\namplitude of the non-Varshni component of the temperature\ndependence. However, Fig. 3 also shows that the highest\nnitrogen content epilayer studied, N=2.2%, displays little or\nno S-shaped behavior. To understand this result, consider the\nevolution of the average energy of the conduction-band\nstates E\n\u2212\n\u0001k\u0002, as defined by Eq. \u00012\u0002, relative to the energy of\nthe BAC states.

When E\n\u2212\n\u0001k=0\u0002 comes within \u0003kBT of\nthe energy of a given pair state, the two effectively become\namalgamated. That is to say, as N is increased through this\ntransitional range \u0001which one can infer from our results oc-\ncurs here between 1.0% and 2.2%\u0002, the distinction between\nthe extended E\n\u2212\n\u0001k\u0002 states and pair states becomes progres-\nsively blurred until, ultimately, the two are indistinguishable.\nThe amplitude of the non-Varshni component would, thus,\ndiminish accordingly, reducing the amplitude of the S-shaped\nbowing. For N\u00052.2%, only states arising from significantly\nless probable higher order complexes \u0001e.g., triplet states\u0002 are\ndistinguishable as BAC states, which will be encountered as\nE\n\u2212\n\u0001k=0\u0002 continues to decrease with added nitrogen. The\nwaxing and waning of the S-shaped bowing seen in Fig. 3 is,\ntherefore, expected to repeat as N is further increased.\nIV. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\nIn order to analyze our PL spectra to obtain, in particular,\nthe band gap energy Eg as a function of N, we shall next\nrestrict the description of our analysis of the present mea-\nsurements to the 300 K PL spectra only. The reasons for this\nwill be explained later.\nThere are a number of procedures in the literature for\nobtaining the band gap transition energy from a band-to-band\nPL feature. The majority of these simplify the analysis by\nassuming either a parabolic dispersion for both the conduc-\ntion and valence bands, or, even more simply, that the PL\npeak position is essentially equal to the transition energy.15\u201318\nSuch simplifications ignore the effects of band nonparabolic-\nity, despite the intrinsically nonparabolic nature of the con-\nduction band in InAs being well documented.19\u201321 Indeed,\nprovided the experimental probe is insensitive to states far\nfrom the CBM, as is usually assumed in PL spectroscopy,\nsuch simplifications are often quite reasonable: it is a non-\ntrivial task to include the corrections necessary to take ac-\ncount of intrinsic nonparabolicity. However, InNAs is ex-\npected to have an additional contribution to non-parabolicity,\nover and above that of InAs, due to the BAC interaction.\nAdditionally, its high n-type doping is likely to result in a\nsignificant occupation of the higher-lying conduction-band\nstates near room temperature, where the effects of a nonpa-\nrabolic dispersion are enhanced. Hence, we consider it im-\nportant to evaluate the influence of nonparabolicity on the\nline shape of the band-to-band PL emission in this material\nsystem in order to give increased confidence in the transition\nenergies we shall obtain here.\nTo that end, we next describe the development of a meth-\nodology that combines a least-squares fitting procedure using\nan analytical parabolic model for the PL line shape function,\nwith a nonparabolic correction derived from a calculated\n\u201cpredicted\u201d PL line shape model. We will show that, al-\nthough both PL line shape models have essentially the same\nbasic form, the introduction of nonparabolicity means that\none cannot write down suitable analytical expressions in this\ncase, and one must resort to numerical methods to complete\nthe analysis. As a starting point, we calculate the nonpara-\nbolic conduction-band dispersion of the host InAs using the\nfollowing eigenvalue of the Pidgeon-Brown Hamiltonian\nmatrix:22\nEM\u0001Ek0\u0002 = Eg\nInAs + Ek0\nEgInAs2Ek0 \u000b\f1 + 8EpEk03\u0001EgInAs\u00022 \u2212 1\r + 1\u000e ,\n\u00013\u0002\nwhere Eg\nInAs is the InAs band gap energy, Ep parametrizes the\nstrength of the k \u00b7p mixing interaction between conduction\nand valence band states \u0006where Ep=21.5 eV for InAs \u0001Ref.\n23\u0002\u0007, and Ek0= \u0001qk\u00022 \/2m0 is the kinetic energy of a free elec-\ntron. The InNAs conduction-band dispersion may then be\ncalculated by substituting this nonparabolic form for EM\n0 into\nEq. \u00012\u0002 \u0006recalling that EM\u0001k\u0002=EM\n0 \u0001k\u0002\u2212\u0003x\u0007. Figure 4 shows\nan example of these calculations for InAs and InNAs with\nN=1.0%. This clearly illustrates the deviations from parabo-\nlicity at energies greater than \u0003100 meV above the respec-\ntive CBMs.\nThe PL emission from a semiconducting alloy at a given\nphoton energy \b\t is proportional to the joint density of\nstates \n linking the initial \u0001E1\u0002 and final \u0001E2\u0002 states, which\ncan be calculated using the following well-known general\nexpression:22\n\n\u0001\b\t=E2\u2212E1\u0002 =\n1\n2\u000b2\u00042m0\b2 \u0005\n3\/2\u0004 dE1dEk0 + dE2dEk0\u0005\n\u22121\nEk0\n1\/2\n, \u00014\u0002\nwhere, for band-to-band recombination in InNAs, E1 is in\nthe E\n\u2212\n\u0001k\u0002 band and E2 is assumed to be in the heavy hole\nFIG. 4.

For states\n\u0005\u00030.1 eV above the InAs CBM, parabolicity is clearly a poor\napproximation to the more realistic nonparabolic dispersion. The\ndispersion for N=1.0% InNAs has been calculated by substituting\nEq. \u00013\u0002 into Eq. \u00012\u0002. As may be seen, the BAC interaction enhances\nthe nonparabolicity only slightly over that of the binary InAs. How-\never, when coupled with the proclivity of InNAs for high n-type\ndegenerate doping, which can lead to the occupation of states well\nabove the CBM, there is significant potential for those states with\nnonparabolic dispersion to contribute to band-to-band PL emission.\nMERRICK et al.

Due to the unintentional degenerate\ndoping of the InNAs material, we assume that Fermi-Dirac\nfunctions fe and fh are appropriate for the electron and hole\noccupations, respectively \u0001applying Boltzmann statistics in\nsuch circumstances would lead to an overestimation of the\nband-to-band energy gap Eg\u0002. We use the following func-\ntional form for our PL line shape model, which incorporates\nan Urbach tail for below-band-edge emission:24\nIPL\u0001\b\t \u0007 Ecr\u0002 = AK exp\u000b \fkBT \u0001\b\t \u2212 Ecr\u0002\r fefh, \u00016a\u0002\nIPL\u0001\b\t \u0005 Ecr\u0002 = A\nfefh, \u00016b\u0002\nwhere Ecr is the energy of the transition \u0001or crossover\u0002 be-\ntween Eqs. \u00016a\u0002 and \u00016b\u0002, K a dummy parameter chosen to\nensure that the transition is a smooth one, T the carrier tem-\nperature, \f a dimensionless phenomenological parameter de-\nscribing the slope of the Urbach tail, and A is related to the\nEinstein coefficient linking the conduction and valence band\nstates \u0001but is treated here as a fitting parameter\u0002.\nBefore considering the effects of using a fully nonpara-\nbolic model for the PL line shape, let us examine what hap-\npens when we make the simplest choice for \n in Eq. \u00016b\u0002,\ni.e., parabolic conduction and valence band dispersions.\nThen, dE1 \/dEk0 and dE2 \/dEk0 in Eq. \u00014\u0002 are both constants,\nso that \n is directly proportional to Ek0\n1\/2 and the familiar\nparabolic joint density of states \npara\r \u0001\b\t-Eg\u00021\/2 is recov-\nered. To obtain the required smooth transition between Eqs.\n\u00016a\u0002 and \u00016b\u0002, it is necessary that both their amplitudes and\nfirst derivatives with respect to photon energy be continuous\nat \b\t=Ecr. For \n=\npara, it is straightforward to show that\nthese continuity conditions require that Ecr=Eg+kBT \/2\f and\nK= \u0001kBT \/2\f\u00021\/2. Hence, IPL\u0001\b\t\u0002 takes on a simple analytical\nform that can easily be programed into a computer for per-\nforming least-squares fits to experimental spectra. Figure 5\nshows an example of fitting this parabolic-dispersion-based\nmodel to the measured PL spectrum for the N=1.0% sample\nat 300 K; A, Eg, T, and \f were all allowed to vary as fit\nparameters, as were Ee and Eh, the quasi-Fermi-energies in fe\nand fh \u0001defined relative to the respective band edges\u0002. Similar\nsatisfactory fits to the 300 K PL spectra of all the samples\nwere obtained using this parabolic model. However, as pre-\nviously remarked, these results must be treated with due cau-\ntion since the effects of a nonparabolic conduction-band dis-\npersion \u0001e.g., as in Fig. 4\u0002 on the line shapes of the InNAs PL\nspectra have been ignored.\nConsequently, we now turn to the physically more realis-\ntic situation incorporating a nonparabolic conduction-band\ndispersion. Unfortunately, it is found that one cannot simply\napply the above procedure when using a nonparabolic joint\ndensity of states \nNP: if dE1 \/dEk0 in Eq. \u00014\u0002 is defined by Eq.\n\u00015\u0002 \u0006with Eq. \u00013\u0002 being needed to obtain dEM \/dEk0\u0007, it is then\nnot possible analytically to solve the continuity requirements\nof Eqs. \u00016a\u0002 and \u00016b\u0002 to obtain expressions for K and Ecr. As\na result, one cannot write down a simple computer program-\nmable function with which to perform the least-squares fit-\nting. However, there is a possible route out of this apparent\ndilemma. For a given set of parameters \f, T, Eg, Ee, and Eh,\ntogether with the nonparabolic density of states function \nNP,\nit is possible to use iterative numerical techniques to find\nvalues for Ecr and K that satisfy the continuity requirements\nof Eqs. \u00016a\u0002 and \u00016b\u0002. Hence, by using the best available\npredictions for the InNAs BAC model parameters, and fully\nincorporating conduction-band nonparabolicity, one can gen-\nerate a predicted PL line shape representative of any given\nalloy composition. By comparing this with the corresponding\nmeasured PL spectrum, one may then manually adjust the\nphenomenological parameters \f \u0001which describes only the\nslope of the below-band-gap Urbach tail\u0002 and A \u0001effectively\nan intensity scaling factor\u0002 to try to obtain a visually reason-\nable match. Although this may give a reasonably good ap-\nproximation to the measured PL spectrum, it is by no means\na \u201cfit.\u201d However, we can next perform a least-squares fit to\nthis predicted nonparabolic model PL line shape using the\naforementioned parabolic model PL line shape. Then, by\ncomparing the resulting parabolic fit parameters with the\noriginal values used to generate the nonparabolic line shape,\none may obtain a quantitative estimate of the errors in the\nFIG. 5.

Here, A, Eg, T, \f,\nand the quasi-Fermi-energies Ee and Eh \u0001measured relative to the\nCBM and VBM, respectively\u0002 were allowed to vary as fit param-\neters, with the resulting values shown on the upper right corner of\nthe figure.\nPHOTOLUMINESCENCE OF InNAs ALLOYS: S-SHAPED\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW B 76, 075209 \u00012007\u0002\n075209-5\nparabolic fit parameters, relative to the original \u0001or \u201ctrue\u201d\u0002\nnonparabolic values, incurred by least-squares fitting the ex-\nperimental line shapes with the parabolic model.\nIn what follows, we demonstrate the implementation of\nthis procedure. The following BAC model parameters have\nbeen derived from tight-binding calculations:4 \u0003=1.30 eV,\n\u0002=1.30 eV, \u0006=2.00 eV, and EN\n0\n=1.36 eV. For Eg\nInAs in Eq.\n\u00013\u0002, a representative value of 350 meV was chosen, which is\nconsistent with suggested literature values.23 Theoretical\nnonparabolic PL line shapes were then generated for N\n=0.0% \u0001i.e., InAs\u0002, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.2%. For these nitrogen\nconcentrations, the Ee and Eh quasi-Fermi-energies of Eqs.\n\u00016a\u0002 and \u00016b\u0002 were calculated based on literature data for n\n\u0001see Table I\u0002 in InNAs alloys with similar compositions.9\n\u0001Parallel conduction through the InAs substrates prevented\nreliable Hall effect measurements of the actual n in the\npresent InNAs epilayers.\u0002 The final phenomenological pa-\nrameters A and \f were then adjusted manually to obtain a\nvisually reasonable match with the corresponding experi-\nmental spectra. These predicted \u0001nonparabolic\u0002 PL line\nshapes were then least-squares fitted using the parabolic line\nshape model.\nAn example of a nonparabolic line shape generated to\nmatch the measured N=1.0% experimental spectrum is\nshown in Fig. 6. Evidently, a satisfactory approximate agree-\nment has been obtained. Note that the BAC model param-\neters predicted for the given alloy composition will be un-\nlikely to yield a perfect match between the predicted and\nmeasured PL peak energies, so one should expect some small\nrelative energy displacement of these two spectra, as is in-\ndeed observed in Fig. 6. The inset of Fig. 6 then shows the\nresult of least-squares fitting the parabolic model to this gen-\nerated nonparabolic PL spectrum. It may be seen that these\ntwo line shapes are very closely matched. What is different,\nhowever, are the two sets of parameters used to generate the\nrespective spectra. Table I gives a comparison of the original\nparameters used to generate the nonparabolic model PL spec-\ntrum, and their fitted parabolic counterparts for N=0.5%,\n1.0%, and 2.2%. As may be seen, the fitted parabolic param-\neters are all different from the original nonparabolic values,\nwith the discrepancies showing a clear increasing trend with\nincreasing N. The parameter of greatest interest here is\nEg, which, for N\u00040.5%, is perturbed by an amount \u000eEg\n\u000f +1.1 meV from its true value. This perturbation is compa-\nTABLE I.

At N=2.2%,\nhowever, a more statistically significant perturbation of\n\u000eEg\u000f +5.7 meV is found.\nIt is unlikely that the nitrogen-induced enhancement in the\nconduction-band effective mass is responsible for the larger\n\u000eEg in the N=2.2% case: in InNAs, for state energies within\n100 meV of the CBM, dE1 \/dEk0 in Eq. \u00014\u0002 is extremely in-\nsensitive to N for 0%\u0007N\u00072.2%. Rather, the dominant fac-\ntor is the increased occupation of states far above the CBM,\nwhich is manifested in our model as a rapidly increasing\nquasi-Fermi-energy Ee as a function of N \u0001see Table I\u0002: e.g.,\nfor N=2.2% and using a literature value9 for n=1\n\u00011018 cm\u22123, our calculations predict that Ee lies \u000380 meV\nabove the CBM. Taking into account the electrons\u2019 thermal\nenergy at 300 K \u0001kBT\u000325 meV\u0002, this means, therefore, that\nthere may be significant occupation of states up to\n\u0003100 meV above the CBM. Inspection of Fig. 4 shows that\nsuch states lie within the region where nonparabolicity is\npredicted to become important. This conclusion, thus, em-\nphasizes the critical role played by band-filling effects in\ndetermining the optical properties of InNAs.\nIn Fig. 7, we plot the \u201cerror\u201d \u000eEg due to fitting a nonpa-\nrabolic PL feature with the parabolic line shape model as a\nfunction of N. This suggests that \u000eEg increases empirically\nas the square of N. Therefore, the key result of this analysis\nis that, in order to account for the effects of nonparabolicity\non the line shape of band-to-band PL emission from bulk\nInNAs for N\u00072.2%, the values of Eg obtained by fitting\nexperimental PL spectra with a parabolic model should sim-\nply be corrected downward by an amount \u000eEg= \u00010.8\n+N2\u0002 meV.\nBy returning now to the parabolic model fits to the experi-\nmental 300 K PL spectra, the open circles in Fig. 8 show the\nvalues obtained for Eg\u0001para fit\u0002 as a function of N.

Although visually satisfactory fits to\nthe experimental spectra could be obtained, the resulting fit-\nted parameters \u0001particularly Ee and Eh\u0002 were found to be\nphysically unrealistic. We attribute this to the increased con-\ntribution of BAC states to the PL emission as the temperature\nis lowered, which progressively skews the measured PL\npeaks toward lower energy \u0001see earlier discussion on the\nS-shaped bowing\u0002. The PL line shape fitting function defined\nby Eqs. \u00016a\u0002 and \u00016b\u0002 is valid for band-to-band recombina-\ntion only, so the fitting algorithm then attempted to compen-\nsate for the change in line shape induced by the BAC states\nby modifying Ee and Eh. The lower the sample temperature,\nthe greater the contribution from the BAC states, and the\nmore unphysical the fit parameters became. Therefore, a\nmore sophisticated model, capable of modeling multiple re-\ncombination paths, is required to analyze the lower tempera-\nture PL emission from InNAs.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe PL emission from a selection of InNAs epilayers with\nN\u00072.2% has been measured as a means of studying band\ngap reduction in the alloy system. At both elevated \u0001300 K\u0002\nand low temperature \u000115 K\u0002, an unambiguous and incremen-\ntal redshift in the emission has been observed as a function\nof increasing N. A signature S-shaped temperature depen-\ndence common to dilute nitride materials is observed in the\npeak emission energy of several epilayers, the amplitude of\nwhich increases with nitrogen content for N\u00071.0%. How-\never, for 2.2% N, the highest concentration studied, little or\nno S-shaped bowing is apparent. These observations are\nfound to be qualitatively consistent with the predictions of\nthe BAC and LCINS models.\nThe 300 K PL spectrum from each epilayer has been fit-\nted with a model that assumes a parabolic conduction-band\ndispersion in order to obtain band-to-band transition energies\nEg. However, in order to account for the effects of fitting\nsuch a parabolic model to the PL spectra of an intrinsically\nnonparabolic system, theoretical PL spectra have been gen-\nerated using a fully nonparabolic model for the same mate-\nrial system. Then by least-squares fitting these generated the-\noretical spectra with the parabolic PL line shape model, a\nquantitative estimate has been derived for the error in the\nfitted values of Eg due to incorrectly assuming a parabolic\nconduction-band dispersion. This small and positive error is\nfound to increase as the square of N \u0001for N\u00072.2%\u0002. By\napplying this small error correction to the values for Eg ob-\ntained from our parabolic fits of the 300 K experimental PL\nspectra, more accurate estimates of Eg accounting for\nconduction-band nonparabolicity are, thus, obtained, particu-\nlarly for N\u000f1.0%. A fit of the BAC model to these corrected\n300 K Eg values, plotted as a function of N, yields param-\neters in satisfactory agreement with theoretical values de-\nrived from tight-binding calculations. Additionally, a reduc-\ntion in the 300 K band gap of \u000329.6 meV per N has been\nestimated from the gradient of this fitted BAC model curve,\nwhich is only 0.2 meV per N larger than the corresponding\ntheoretical value.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank E.

Comparison of the theoretical BAC model param-\neters derived from tight-binding calculations for InNAs at 300 K\n\u0001see dashed curve in Fig. 8\u0002 and values obtained by fitting Eq. \u00012\u0002 to\nthe experimental values of Eg as a function of N \u0001after correction\nfor the nonparabolic conduction-band dispersion, see solid curve in\nFig. 8\u0002. In this fitting procedure, the initial parameter estimates were\ntaken from the theoretical values shown for \u0003, \u0002, \u0006, and EN\n0\n, while\nfor Eg\nInAs \u0006\u0010EM\n0 \u0001k=0\u0002\u0007, a value of 350 meV was used, as discussed\nin the main text. Note that the model is relatively insensitive to\nchanges in \u0006, so the uncertainty in its fitted value \u0001not shown\u0002 is\npotentially very large.\nParameter\nTheoretical value\n\u0001eV\u0002\nFit value\n\u0001eV\u0002\n\u0003 1.30 1.30\u00b10.52\n\u0002 1.30 1.31\u00b10.19\n\u0006 2.00 2.00\nEN\n0 1.36 1.36\u00b10.41\nEM\n0 \u0001k=0\u0002 0.350 0.350\u00b10.004\nMERRICK et al.
