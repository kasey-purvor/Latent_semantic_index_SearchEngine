We find a violation of Matthiessen\u2019s rule that can be explained by a\nmodel of the conductivity involving a defect-assisted interlayer channel which acts in parallel with\nthe band-like conductivity. We observe an unusual dependence of Tc on residual resistivity which is\nnot consistent with the generalised Abrikosov-Gor\u2019kov theory for an order parameter with a single\ncomponent, providing an important constraint on models of the superconductivity in this material.\nPACS numbers: 74.70.Kn, 74.62.Dh, 74.25.Fy\nQuasi-two-dimensional organic conductors based on\nthe donor molecule bisethylenedithiotetrathiafulvalene\n(BEDT-TTF or ET, see inset to Fig. 1) have attracted\nsustained interest [1]. These materials consist of layers of\nET separated by inorganic anions and can be prepared\nwith exceptional purity, so that magnetic oscillations in\nthe resistivity can be observed at relatively low fields [2].\nMany experiments have been conducted to elucidate the\nsymmetry of the superconducting order parameter but\ndespite growing evidence of unconventional superconduc-\ntivity [3], the matter has remained unresolved [4].\nThe normal state of these materials is unusual with\nthe temperature dependence of the electrical transport\nand the optical conductivity deviating significantly from\nwhat would be expected for a conventional metal [5, 6],\nshowing a crossover from insulating-like conductivity at\nhigh temperature to metallic-like behaviour at lower tem-\nperature (see Fig. 1). This effect has been successfully\ndescribed within the framework of dynamical mean-field\ntheory (DMFT) as a crossover from an incoherent \u201cbad-\nmetal\u201d state at high temperatures to a coherent Fermi\nliquid below \u223c30 K [5, 6]. The usual effect of disorder\nis to change only the temperature independent compo-\nnent of the resistivity; this is known as Matthiessen\u2019s\nrule. However, several strongly correlated materials vio-\nlate Matthiessen\u2019s rule including various cuprate [7] and\norganic [8] superconductors. Violations of Matthiessen\u2019s\nrule have previously been taken as evidence for non-Fermi\nliquid behaviour. In particular, Strack et al. [8] have ar-\ngued that the violations of Matthiessen\u2019s rule in the salt\n\u03ba-(ET)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br indicate that the description of\nthe conductivity in terms of a crossover from an incoher-\nent metal to a Fermi liquid is incorrect.\nThe behaviour of the superconducting transition tem-\nperature Tc as a function of non-magnetic disorder\n[4, 9, 10] also provides a crucial test of the symmetry\nof the order parameter. Anderson\u2019s theorem [11] states\nthat for s-wave pairing non-magnetic impurities do not\naffect Tc. For magnetic impurities Tc is strongly re-\nduced for singlet states in a manner described by the\nAbrikosov-Gor\u2019kov (AG) formula [12]. For non-s-wave\n(including extended-s) order parameters, scattering due\nto non-magnetic impurities reduces Tc in a manner again\ndescribed using the AG formula [4, 9, 10].\nIn order to investigate these effects experimentally for\nthe ET superconductors, we have selected \u03ba-(ET)2Cu-\n(SCN)2, which has one of the highest transition temper-\natures (Tc \u2248 10K) in this family and whose electronic\nproperties have been the subject of detailed study [2].\nIt is possible to introduce disorder into these samples\nby adjusting the cooling rate [13, 14], an effect which is\nprobably due to the freezing of terminal ethylene group\ndisorder which occurs at around 70\u201380 K [4, 15]. How-\never, we find that we have more control in our experiment\nby introducing disorder via irradiation by either x-rays\nor protons. X-rays and protons give similar effects, but\nwe have been able to perform more detailed experiments\nusing the former and hence we concentrate mainly on the\nx-ray damaged samples in our discussion.\nIn this Letter we report the violation of Matthiessen\u2019s\nrule in \u03ba-(ET)2Cu(SCN)2. However, we find that a sim-\nple theory which includes the effect of interlayer scatter-\ning from impurities is able to explain this effect. Further\nwe have confirmed quantitative predictions of this model\nrelating the low temperature resistivity to the high tem-\nperature conductivity. Thus we find that the violation\nof Matthiessen\u2019s rule is consistent with the DMFT de-\nscription of the crossover in transport behaviour [6]. We\nalso observe a disorder-induced suppression of Tc which\nis consistent with a non-s-wave gap.\nOur measurements have been performed on single crys-\ntals of \u03ba-(ET)2Cu(SCN)2 grown electrochemically. Gold\n2wire of thickness 12.5\u00b5m was attached to the sam-\nples (typical dimensions 0.3\u00d70.3\u00d70.1mm3) with graphite\npaste in the four-probe configuration. Samples were\ncooled from 120K to 10K at a rate of 20K\/hr, below the\nslowest rate used in Ref. 14, in order to avoid introducing\ndisorder from fast-cooling. Defects in our samples were\ncreated at room temperature by filtered Cu K\u03b1 radiation\n(E = 8keV, \u03bb = 1.54 A\u02da) from a Cu x-ray rotating anode\n(typically 55 kV, 50mA) at a flux of \u2248 2.5\u00d7 108 photons\ns\u22121. The computer program RADDOSE [16] allowed this\nto be converted into a dose rate of \u2248 105Gy s\u22121. Using\ntabulated absorption coefficients and assuming that the\nmass absorption coefficient of \u03ba-(ET)2Cu(SCN)2 can be\ncalculated as the sum of the mass absorption coefficients\nof the constituent atoms [17], we estimate the x-ray at-\ntenuation length to be 90 \u00b5m, approximately the thick-\nness of the samples. In order to attain uniform damage\nwe irradiated both sides of the sample. X-ray doses up\nto 630 MGy were used. Proton irradiation experiments\ntook place at Surrey Ion Beam Centre. Protons were ac-\ncelerated to 4 MeV and could be implanted to a mean\ndepth of 150 \u00b5m, providing an approximately uniform\ndamage profile for samples \u2264100 \u00b5m. For each incre-\nmental radiation dose, we make a measurement of the\ntransport properties; the contact configurations stay the\nsame throughout the experiment. For each type of irra-\ndiation, the resistivity was found to be reproducible over\nmultiple thermal cycles, so that we can be confident that\nthe observed changes are due to irradiation and not to\nthermal cycling.\nIt is immediately apparent from Fig. 1 that the effect\nof increasing irradiation dose is to decrease the resistivity\nover most of the temperature range, and in particular to\nreduce the magnitude of the broad peak centred around\nTp \u223c90 K. Well into the Fermi-liquid regime however, the\nbehaviour recovers a traditional metallic character; below\n\u223c46 K, the resistivity increases with increasing irradia-\ntion dose (see inset to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). This violation\nof Matthiessen\u2019s rule is not predicted by DMFT alone\nfor the low defect densities produced in our experiments\nand therefore appears at first sight to be at odds with\nthe DMFT description of electronic transport in layered\norganic charge transfer salts.\nThe low-temperature region of Fig. 1 is presented in de-\ntail in Fig. 2, more clearly showing the superconducting\ntransition for the same range of x-ray irradiation doses.\nFor each trace, the resistivity follows a Fermi-liquid like\nT 2 dependence at temperatures above the superconduct-\ning transition and a sharp drop at the onset of super-\nconductivity. The residual resistivity \u03c10 is extracted by\nfitting data to \u03c1 = \u03c10 + AT\n2 in the temperature range\nfrom just above Tc to 20K. The upper inset to Fig. 2\npresents the change in residual resistivity \u2206\u03c10 with re-\nspect to an undamaged sample as a function of dosage,\nshowing an approximately linear dependence.\nThe observation that increasing defect density in-\nFIG. 1: Interlayer resistivity of an x-ray damaged sample as\na function of temperature for a range of irradiation doses,\nshowing the violation of Matthiessen\u2019s rule.

Data from proton-irradiated\nsamples show a similar pattern as a function of disorder. The\nlower inset shows three methods of defining the critical tem-\nperature: a lower Tc1, an upper Tc2 and Tc, the maximum of\nthe first derivative, which is the definition used in this paper.\n3creases the interlayer conductivity over a wide temper-\nature range leads us to hypothesize that defects affect\nthe conductivity in two ways: (i) the resistivity associ-\nated with band-like transport due to the overlap of the\nmolecular orbitals increases linearly with defect density\nas prescribed by Matthiessen\u2019s rule; (ii) there is a parallel\ndefect-assisted interlayer channel, whose conductivity is\nproportional to the defect density [18]. This model sug-\ngests that the interlayer conductivity \u03c3(x, T ) depends on\na dimensionless quantity x, which is proportional to the\ndefect density, and temperature T as\n\u03c3(x, T ) =\n1\n\u03c10(0) + x\u03c1imp + \u03c1intrinsic(T )\n+ x\u03c3\u22a5, (1)\nwhere \u03c10(0) is the residual resistivity of the undam-\naged sample, x\u03c1imp is the contribution to the resis-\ntivity from defect scattering in the transport due to\nmolecular orbital overlap, \u03c1intrinsic(T ) is the intrinsic\ntemperature-dependent scattering contribution (due to\nelectron-electron interactions, phonon scattering, etc.)\nand x\u03c3\u22a5 is the defect-assisted interlayer conductivity.\nThe applicability of this model can be demonstrated\nby examining low and high temperature limits. At low\ntemperature \u03c1intrinsic(T ) is small so that\n\u03c1(x, T ) \u2248 \u03c10(0) + x\u03c1imp + \u03c1intrinsic(T ), (2)\nand hence the resistivity increases linearly with defect\ndensity, x. At high temperature \u03c1intrinsic(T ) \u226b \u03c10(0) +\nx\u03c1imp and Eqn (1) becomes\n\u03c1(x, T ) \u2248\n(\nx\u03c3\u22a5 + \u03c1\n\u22121\nintrinsic(T )\n)\u22121\n(3)\nhence the conductivity \u03c1(x, T )\u22121 linearly increases with\nx, as observed. The inset to Fig. 1 shows that there is\na temperature, Tcross, at which the resistivity is inde-\npendent of defect density. In our model, this can be\nfound by evaluating d\u03c3(x, T )\/dx = 0. We find that\na T -independent crossing point occurs when the condi-\ntions (i) x\u03c1imp \u226a \u03c10(0) + \u03c1intrinsic and (ii) \u03c1(0, Tcross) =\n(\u03c1imp\/\u03c3\u22a5)\n1\/2 are satisfied. For our x-ray damaged sam-\nples, this yields an estimate of \u03c1imp\/\u03c3\u22a5 = 3\u00d710\n3\u21262cm2.\nWe can obtain an independent estimate of this pa-\nrameter by plotting \u2206\u03c3p = \u03c3(x, Tp) \u2212 \u03c3(0, Tp) against\n\u2206\u03c10 = \u03c10(x) \u2212 \u03c10(0), as shown in Fig. 3. The for-\nmer quantity can be evaluated in the high temperature\nlimit (Eqn. 3) to be \u2206\u03c3p \u2248 x\u03c3\u22a5, while the latter quan-\ntity can be evaluated in the low-temperature limit to be\n\u2206\u03c10 \u2248 x\u03c1imp. The approximate straight-line dependence\n(which breaks down when \u2206\u03c10 and \u2206\u03c30 are large) ob-\nserved in Fig. 3 shows that both quantities are param-\neterised by x in the same way, and the gradient of the\nline yields \u03c1imp\/\u03c3\u22a5 = 1.5\u00d7 10\n3 \u21262cm2, in order of mag-\nnitude agreement with our previous estimate [19].

Due to the dif-\nferent nature of the defects, the slope of proton (two different\nsamples shown with open circles and squares) and x-ray (one\nsample indicated by filled circles) data differ, though the ef-\nfect remains qualitatively the same. Inset: the position Tp of\nthe resistivity peak shifts slightly to higher temperature with\nincreasing \u03c10(x).\ndemonstrating that the nature of the irradiation affects\nthe ratio \u03c1imp\/\u03c3\u22a5, suggesting that x-rays and protons\nproduce different types of damage (protons producing a\nmore effective interplane transport channel than x-rays).\nThe value of Tc, corresponding to the maximum of\nd\u03c1\/dT in Fig. 2, is plotted as a function of \u03c10 in Fig. 4.\nWe find that Tc falls with defect density (in agreement\nwith measurements of defects induced by cooling-rate dis-\norder [13]), but the dependence exhibits a sharp change in\ngradient when \u03c10 reaches a threshold value \u03c1\n\u2217\n0 \u2248 2 \u2126cm.\nHowever, even at the highest defect densities studied,\nthe samples exhibit a superconducting ground state. We\nalso find that the width \u2206T = Tc2 \u2212 Tc1 (see Fig. 2) of\nthe superconducting transition decreases with increasing\ndefect density, as shown in the inset to Fig. 4. This is\nconsistent with Tc exhibiting a change of gradient with\ndamage; at high damage, local variations in damage have\na smaller effect on the broadening of the transition be-\ncause dTc\/d\u03c10 is lower.\nThe theory of AG [9, 12] for non-magnetic defects in a\nnon-s-wave superconductor implies that the suppression\nof Tc follows the AG formula given by\nln\nTc\nTc0\n= \u03c8\n(\n1\n2\n)\n\u2212 \u03c8\n(\n1\n2\n+\nh\u00af\n4pikBTc\u03c4\n)\n(4)\nwhere \u03c8 is a digamma function and \u03c4 is the scattering\ntime.

The suppression is approxi-\nmately linear for low damage \u03c10(x) < \u03c1\n\u2217\n0 = 2 \u2126cm, but there\nis a change in gradient for \u03c10 > \u03c1\n\u2217\n0.

This linear sector should\nhave a slope consistent with interlayer transport theory\n[4], i.e. dTc\/d\u03c10 = \u2212e\n2m\u2217d\u22a5t\n2\n\u22a5\n\/(4kBh\u00af\n3), where m\u2217 is the\neffective mass, d\u22a5 is the interlayer spacing and t\u22a5 is the\ninterlayer transfer integral. Using the value of m\u2217 from\ntransport measurements, our measured slope of the sup-\npression of Tc for \u03c10 < \u03c1\n\u2217\n0 yields (the line in Fig. 4), a\nvalue of t\u22a5 = 0.03 \u00b1 0.01 meV, in good agreement with\nthe value from angle-dependent magnetotransport [20].\nThus the suppression of Tc for \u03c10 < \u03c1\n\u2217\n0 is consistent with\na non-s-wave gap. However, the departure from the AG\nformula for \u03c10 > \u03c1\n\u2217\n0 casts doubt on this interpretation.\nWe note that our value of \u03c1\u22170 corresponds to a ratio\nof the in-plane coherence length to the mean free path\n\u03be\/l \u2248 0.2. If all scattering events contributing to l were\npair-breaking, it would be expected that superconduc-\ntivity should be suppressed by this degree of scattering.\nCrucially, the observed change of gradient is not expected\nfor a model involving an order parameter with a single\ncomponent within the AG theory. Even a generalised\nAG equation describing multicomponent order param-\neters [21] does not quantitatively agree with our data,\nthough this approach assumes that disorder does not af-\nfect the symmetry of the order parameter; it is probably\nnecessary to examine specific candidate pairing interac-\ntions in detail. An explanation for this behaviour might\ninvolve a mixed order parameter with both s-wave and\nunconventional components or interband scattering.\nIn conclusion, we have investigated the effect of\nradiation-induced disorder in \u03ba-(ET)2Cu(SCN)2. We\nfind that a dramatic departure from Matthiessen\u2019s rule\ncan be straightforwardly explained in terms of defect as-\nsisted interlayer tunnelling. Although Tc initially follows\na dependence on \u03c10 consistent with pair-breaking scatter-\ning, the superconducting state proves to be robust into\nthe dirty limit. This unusual dependence of Tc on \u03c10\nis not consistent with an order parameter with a single\ncomponent, providing an important constraint on models\nof the superconductivity in this material.\nWe acknowledge funding from EPSRC, the Royal Soci-\nety (A.A.), BBSCR (R.L.O.) and the ARC (B.J.P.).

[8] observed the violation of Matthiessen\u2019s\nrule in two crystals of \u03ba-(ET)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br prepared\nby different synthetic routes. However, this data is con-\nsistent with our model if one postulates that the crys-\ntal labelled HR in Ref. 8 has a larger \u03c1imp\/\u03c3\u22a5 than the\ncrystal labelled LR. This hypothesis is consistent with\nour observation that x-ray and proton irradiation lead\nto different \u03c1imp\/\u03c3\u22a5. Our model also explains the very\ndifferent temperature dependences of the in-plane and\nout-of-plane resistivities reported for the LR crystal.\n[20] J. Singleton et al., Phys. Rev.
