We also examined the neural markers of\ncolor\u2013motion correlation processing in event-related potentials. Color and motion information was dissociated using\na two-colored random dot kinematogram, wherein coherent motion and motion noise differed from each other only in\ntheir S-cone component, with spatial and temporal parameters set so that global motion processing relied solely on\na constant L-M component. Hence, when color and the local motion direction are correlated, more efficient segregation of\ncoherent motion can only be brought about by the S-cone difference, and crucially, this S-cone component does not\nprovide any effective input to a global motion mechanism but only changes the color appearance of the moving dots. The\ncolor contrasts (vector length in the S vs. L-M plane) of both the dots carrying coherent motion and the dots moving\nrandomly were fixed at motion discrimination threshold to ensure equal effectiveness for motion extraction. In the\nbehavioral experiment, participants were asked to discriminate between coherent and random motion, and d9 was\ndetermined for three different conditions: uncorrelated, uncued correlated, and cued correlated. In the electroenceph-\nalographic experiment, participants discriminated direction of motion for uncued correlated and cued correlated\nconditions. Color\u2013motion correlations were found to improve performance. Cueing a specific color also modulated the N1\ncomponent of the event-related potential, with sources in visual area middle temporal. We conclude that S-cone\nsignals \u2018\u2018invisible\u2019\u2019 to the motion system can influence the analysis by direction-selective motion mechanisms through\ngrouping of local motion signals by color. This grouping mechanism must precede motion processing and is likely to\nbe under attentional control.\nKeywords: S-cones, Motion, Color, Grouping, Attention\nIntroduction\nColor and motion direction are basic visual features. Both are\nessential for perceptual organization of the environment and can\nalso capture visual attention with ease (for a review, see Wolfe,\n1998). In natural visual environments, color and motion direction of\nvisual elements can be correlated as different parts of a moving\nobject may be of similar color. In spite of this, many studies do not\nexamine the processing of color\u2013motion correlations in the visual\nsystem, often choosing to vary color and motion independently\n(Bartels & Zeki, 2000). This approach is supported by the fact that\ncolor and motion are processed in anatomically segregated systems\nthat are sparsely interconnected (Shipp & Zeki, 1995). Interactions\nbetween color and motion processing systems are thought to be\nlimited to responsiveness of some motion-selective cells to iso-\nluminant parvocellular stimuli (Logothetis et al., 1990); parvocel-\nlular signals are also enhanced during smooth pursuit eye\nmovements, benefiting the processing of moving stimuli (Schu\u00a8tz\net al., 2008). Time courses of color and motion processing also\ndiffer\u2014Color is analyzed prior to the processing of local motion\nsignals (Moutoussis & Zeki, 1997), which in turn become com-\nbined in order to perceive global motion (i.e., motion of larger\nobjects). Due to these temporal differences, color information could\nact as a cue to segment the image before local motion signals are\nintegrated. This would lead to more efficient processing of scenes\ncontaining motion\u2013color correlations.\nHowever, previous studies indicate that this prediction does not\nhold universally. In many instances, the human motion system\ndoes not seem to use color\u2013motion correlations automatically, and\na segmentation of a dynamic scene by color does not necessarily\nprecede the extraction of motion. In the experiments by Li and\nKingdom (2001), the random dot kinematograms (RDKs) con-\ntained an equal number of signal and noise dots, and all signal dots\n(i.e., dots that move in the same direction) were associated with one\ncolor, and all noise dots (i.e., dots that move in random directions)\nwere associated with another color; the performance was not better\nthan if no color\u2013motion association existed. Under certain con-\nditions, however, observers can exploit the association between\ncolor and motion signals. Croner and Albright (1997) reported\nimproved performance when the number of same-color coherent\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to: Sophie M.

Likewise, an improvement was\nbrought about by cueing in the study of Li and Kingdom (2001): If\nthe observer had prior knowledge of the color that is associated with\nthe signal dots, his or her performance in the motion task improved\neven if signal and noise dots were evenly distributed.\nWhat could be the neural basis for the improvements due to\ncolor\u2013motion correlations described by Croner and Albright (1997)\nand Li and Kingdom (2001)? The processing advantage could have\noccurred through the operation of a neural module sensitive to both\nthe color and the motion direction. Alternatively, a feedback from\ncolor processing areas could have led to the segregation (i.e.,\ngrouping) of local motion signals associated with the same color, an\noption suggested by Li and Kingdom (2001). Using a chromatic\nmotion paradigm that allows us to dissociate color and motion\ninformation, we can eliminate the possibility of joint color\u2013motion\nprocessing, leaving grouping by color as the only possible mech-\nanism that leads to improvements due to color\u2013motion correlations.\nCroner and Albright (1997) and Li and Kingdom (2001) used two-\ncolor RDKs where all the dots carried a large but constant\nluminance signal and, in addition, the signal and noise dots differed\nalong the red\u2013green dimension (i.e., had different L-M-cone inputs).\nIt has been demonstrated that unless specific stimulus parameters\nare used (large blob size and fast motion speed; Ruppertsberg et al.,\n2003, 2007), global motion extraction in the isoluminant plane only\noperates on local motion signals that contain an L-M component\n(Fig. 1a); if the RDK consists of local motion signals defined\nexclusively along the S-cone isolating axis, only the color of the\nsignal is processed but no global motion direction can be extracted\n(i.e., motion always appears random). As summarized in Fig. 1a,\ndifferences in the S-cone signals affect only color appearance,\nwhile different L-M inputs affect not only color appearance but can\nalso be used to extract global motion (Ruppertsberg et al., 2003). In\nthe experiment reported here, we used the fact that the S-cone\nsignals are \u2018\u2018invisible\u2019\u2019 to the motion system for a wide range of\nspatial and temporal parameters. We generate a stimulus with a\nconstant DLM signal (Fig. 1a), allowing for global motion to be\nextracted. Then, we can manipulate color appearance by adding\nan S-cone component (DS; increment or decrement\u2014see Fig. 1),\nwhich will have no input into the motion mechanism, as DLM for\nboth colors would remain the same. Therefore, selective color-\nbased enhancement of the local motion signal is not possible, and\nthe only mechanism that can lead to improvements in performance\nis grouping by color.\nLi and Kingdom (2001) have already hypothesized that grouping\nby color is the crucial process that underlies improvements due to\ncolor\u2013motion correlations. They also argued that attentional selec-\ntion is crucial if such grouping is to lead to an improvement in\nperformance; attentional selection could operate in both an exog-\nenous (Croner & Albright, 1997) and an endogenous (Li &\nKingdom, 2001) fashion. More precisely, Li and Kingdom (2001)\nargued that the difference in the proportion of signal-color and\nnoise-color blobs had introduced an exogenous cue that created\na pop-out effect in the study by Croner and Albright (1997),\ncapturing the attention of observers and thus improving perfor-\nmance. The effect by Croner and Albright (1997) is thus derived\nfrom exogenous (\u2018\u2018bottom-up,\u2019\u2019 stimulus-driven) attention; its main\ncharacteristic is that it is automatically drawn by an abruptly\nappearing or salient stimuli. The time course of such attentional\nenhancement is rapid and transient. Li and Kingdom (2001) have\nargued that the effect they obtained is due to endogenous (\u2018\u2018top-\ndown,\u2019\u2019 goal-driven) attention; here, attention is deployed voluntar-\nily to a certain location or attribute. Endogenous attention has a slow\nand sustained time course (Mu\u00a8ller & Rabbitt, 1989). Exogenous and\nendogenous attention interact with each other, although they are\nsubserved by partially segregated networks of brain areas (Corbetta\n& Shulman, 2002). Our experiments will provide us with a possi-\nbility to further investigate the potential role of attention in per-\nformance improvements due to color\u2013motion correlations.\nThe novelty of our approach when compared to Croner and\nAlbright (1997) and Li and Kingdom (2001) lies in the fact that\nFig. 1. (Color online) (a) The chromaticities of colors C1 and C2 in the isoluminant DKL plane. Along the L-M axis, only the difference\nbetween L- and M-cone varies, while keeping L + M constant (DLM). Along the S-axis, only the S-cones vary. Colors C1 (magenta) and\nC2 (orange) only differ in their S-cone component (DS). (b) In this example, a RDK is presented, wherein all signal blobs are of color C1\nand all noise blobs are of color C2. C1 and C2 only differ in their S-cone component (DS), which changes the color appearance but does\nnot contribute anything to the motion signal. Any facilitation must therefore occur through grouping based on the S-cone component.\n238 Martinovic et al.\nby choosing the appropriate spatial and temporal parameters\n(Ruppertsberg et al., 2003), we can study global motion extraction\nusing chromatic modulations that produce a strong color difference\n(e.g., Wuerger et al., 2005) between signal and noise blobs without\naffecting the local motion signal. To that end, we generated\nisoluminant RDKs where signal blobs (i.e., coherent motion) and\nnoise blobs (random motion) differed only in the S-cone compo-\nnent, while both signal and noise blobs had the same L-M\ncomponent (DS; Fig. 1). This will allow us to look at the effect of\ngrouping by color in isolation.\nAnother aim of our study was to identify the neural markers in\nthe human electroencephalogram (EEG) that would accompany\nsuch grouping by color driven by S-cone signals when the signal\ncolor is cued (as in Li & Kingdom, 2001). The high temporal\nresolution of EEG makes it well suited for the study of specific\nneural markers of early visual processing. In fact, there is a large\nbody of EEG work, wherein overlapping surfaces consisting of\nrotating dots are formed through color\u2013motion correlations and\nexogenous cues are used to direct attention to either one of them\n(Valdes-Sosa et al., 1998, 2004; Pinilla et al., 2001). Exogenous\ncueing of the surface containing the motion translation affects early\nsensory components P1 and N1 of the human event related potential\n(ERP). Valdes-Sosa et al. (1998), for instance, found that color-\nbased attention suppresses P1 and N1 components elicited by the\ntranslation of the unattended surface. In other studies, the amplitude\nof the N1 was affected by attentional cueing (Pinilla et al., 2001;\nLopez et al., 2004), similarly to N1 effects observed in studies with\nspatial cueing tasks (e.g., Eimer, 1993, 1994). In line with these\nfindings, we expected to obtain a modulation of the N1 in our EEG\nexperiment, with larger amplitude for cued stimuli. We did not\nexpect that the P1 component will be present in our data as this\ncomponent is usually absent when isoluminant chromatic displays\nare used (Porciatti & Sartucci, 1999; Khoe et al., 2005).\nGeneral methods\nRationale\nThe purposes of our experiments are (1) to investigate whether the\nvisual system can use correlations between color and motion to\nsegregate motion noise from coherent motion using only color as\na grouping cue and (2) to determine the neural correlates of color\ncueing using EEG.\nIn the main experiments, we therefore used isoluminant two-\ncolor RDKs, wherein one color, the \u2018\u2018signal\u2019\u2019 color, is associated\nwith coherent motion, and the other color, the \u2018\u2018noise\u2019\u2019 color, is\nassociated with random motion. Observers had to discriminate\nbetween random and coherent motion. The signal color and the\nnoise color differed only along the S-cone axis (Fig. 1) but not in\ntheir L-M coordinate. The advantage of defining the color differ-\nence only by S-cone modulation is that any performance improve-\nment can only be driven by the color difference and not by a direct\ngain in the color\u2013motion signals per se since the S-cone component\nis invisible to the motion mechanism.\nIn the following, we describe three experiments. In the baseline\nexperiment, we used single-color RDKs to confirm that the\ncolors C1 and C2 (Fig. 1) are equally effective in a global motion\ndiscrimination task and that S-cone modulation per se cannot be\nused effectively in this task. In Experiment 1, we tested whether\nS-cone signal\u2013defined correlations between the color and the di-\nrection of the local motion signals are exploited automatically\n(Croner & Albright, 1997) or whether this requires a top-down cue\n(Li & Kingdom, 2001). In Experiment 2, we used EEG to char-\nacterize the neural markers of color cueing.\nApparatus\nOur experiments were run on a standard PC with a VSG2\/5 graphics\ncard (32 MB memory; Cambridge Research Systems, Ltd., Kent,\nUK). The stimulus presentation was controlled using Matlab\n(Mathworks, Natick, MA), and the stimuli were presented on a\n21-inch cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor (SONY GDM-F500,\nBerkshire, UK). The chromatic and luminance output of the mon-\nitor were calibrated using the Colour CAL (Cambridge Research\nSystems, Ltd.) and checked with a spectroradiometer (Photo Re-\nsearch PR650; Glen Spectra, Ltd., Middlesex, UK). The monitor had\nbeen switched on for at least 30 min before any experiment. Par-\nticipants responded via a button box (CT3; Cambridge Research\nSystems, Ltd.) and were seated 140 cm from the screen in an otherwise\ndark cubicle.\nThe psychophysics and the EEG laboratory are equipped with\nthe same visual display apparatus (DELL PC with a VSG2\/5\ngraphics card; SONY GDM-F500 monitor). The visual displays in\nboth laboratories were calibrated such that they produced identical\nmaximum outputs.\nColor space\nTo describe the chromatic properties of our stimuli, we used the\nDerrington, Krauskopf, & Lennie (DKL) color space (Derrington\net al., 1984; Brainard, 1996), which is an extension of the MacLeod\u2013\nBoynton chromaticity diagram (MacLeod & Boynton, 1979). In\nthis space, any color is defined by modulations along three different\n\u2018\u2018cardinal\u2019\u2019 axes: Along the achromatic axis, all three cone classes\n(L, M, and S) are modulated such that the contrast is identical, that\nis, DL\/DLBG 5 DM\/DMBG 5 DS\/DSBG, where DL, DM, and DS\ndenote the incremental cone excitations in three cone classes, re-\nspectively. LBG,, MBG, and SBG indicate the L-, M-, and S-cone\nexcitations of the background. By definition, the maximum contrast\nthat can be achieved in each cone class is 1 if stimuli are modulated\nalong the achromatic direction. The second direction refers to\na modulation along a red\u2013green axis; modulations in this direction\nleave the excitation of the S-cones constant (i.e., DS 5 0), and the\nexcitation of the L- and M-cones covaries as to keep their sum\nconstant. Therefore, this axis if referred to as a \u2018\u2018constant S-cone axis\u2019\u2019\n(Kaiser & Boyton, 1996, p. 306) or a \u2018\u2018red\u2013green isoluminant\u2019\u2019 axis\n(Brainard, 1996). Along the third axis, only the S-cones are modulated,\nand DL 5 DM 5 0. Therefore, this axis is often referred to as a\n\u2018\u2018constant L & M cone\u2019\u2019 axis (Kaiser & Boyton, 1996, p. 306) or as\nan \u2018\u2018S-cone isoluminant\u2019\u2019 axis (Brainard, 1996) or as a \u2018\u2018tritanopic\nconfusion line.\u2019\u2019\nInstead of defining the chromatic properties of a stimulus by\ntheir respective L-, M-, and S-cone modulations, the stimulus can\nbe defined in terms of the responses of a set of hypothesized\nmechanisms that are isolated by these cardinal color modulations\n(Derrington et al., 1984; Brainard, 1996; Eskew et al., 1999;\nWuerger et al., 2002). The three corresponding mechanisms are\ntwo cone-opponent color mechanisms and a luminance mechanism.\nOne of the two cone-opponent mechanisms is a red\u2013green mech-\nanism that takes the weighted difference between the differential\nL- and the M-cone excitations. The second cone-opponent mech-\nanism is a yellowish\u2013violet mechanism that takes the weighted\ndifference between the differential S-cone and the summed differ-\nential M- and L-cone excitations. The luminance mechanism sums\nGrouping by S-cone signals 239\nthe weighted differential M- and L-cone signals. For the sake of\nsimplicity, these mechanisms are referred to as \u2018\u2018L + M,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018L\u0002M,\u2019\u2019\nand \u2018\u2018S \u0002 (L + M)\u2019\u2019 (Derrington et al., 1984).\nIn the present study, we only used stimuli in an isoluminant\nplane (at 50 cd\/m2), which is shown in Fig. 1a. The Commission\nInternationale de l\u2019Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of the gray back-\nground are as follows: x5 0.289, y5 0.301, and Lum5 50.1 cd\/m2;\nthe corresponding cone coordinates are L 5 32.43, M 5 17.68,\nand S 5 1.10. Along the \u2018\u2018L \u0002 M\u2019\u2019 direction, red is indicated by\n0 deg and at a radius (r) of 1, its absolute cone coordinates are L5\n34.74, M5 15.76, and S5 1.09; 180 deg refers to green (at r5 1,\nL 5 30.33, M 5 19.47, and S 5 1.09). Along the \u2018\u2018S \u0002 (M + L)\u2019\u2019\ndirection, 90 deg represents violet (at r5 1, L5 32.15, M5 17.54,\nand S 5 1.86), and 270 deg indicates yellow\u2013green (at r 5 1, L 5\n32.42, M 5 17.47, and S 5 0.33). Therefore, for a radius of 1, the\nresulting L-, M-, and S-cone contrasts along the L-M axis are as\nfollows: for modulations from gray to red: 0.07 (L),\u00020.11 (M), and\n0.0 (S); for modulations from gray to green: \u00020.065 (L), 0.10 (M),\nand 0.0 (S). For positive S-cone modulations (between gray and\nviolet), the L-, M-, and S-cone contrasts corresponding to a radius\nof 1 are: 0.0 (L), 0.0 (M), and 0.7 (S); negative S-cone modulations\n(between gray and yellow\u2013green) of radius 1 yield a negative\nS-cone contrast of \u00020.7 and zero L- and M-cone contrasts. When\ncone contrast is defined as vector length in L-, M-, and S-cone\ncontrast space, a radius of 1 for L-M modulations corresponds\nto a cone contrast of 0.13 and to a cone contrast of 0.7 for S-cone\nmodulations.\nStimuli\nWe used RDKs with 300 colored Gaussian blobs. Half of the blobs\nwere defined by an S-cone increment (Fig. 1; C1, indicated by\n45 deg, at r5 1, L5 33.93, M5 16.37, and S5 1.63) and the other\nhalf by an S-cone decrement (C2, indicated by 315 deg, at r 5 1,\nL 5 33.76, M 5 16.04, and S 5 0.55). Colors C1 and C2 differed\nonly in their S-cone component (DS; Fig. 1) and therefore looked\nvery different (C1: magenta and C2: orange).\nEach single Gaussian blob subtended a visual angle of 0.22\ndeg. The blobs moved at a speed of 1 deg\/s, and the array of the\nRDK was 7.9 3 6 deg on an otherwise gray background. The\nmonitor refresh rate was 120 Hz. Each individual blob moved\nalong a trajectory during a 350-ms interval (i.e., their lifetime was\nnot limited). No overlap was allowed between the trajectories of\nindividual blobs. A separate RDK was generated for each stimulus\ninterval. The coherence level, that is, the proportion of the\nGaussian blobs in the RDK that shared the same motion direction,\nwas 50% (Fig. 2a) in order to prevent differences in the number of\nblobs of a particular color.\nThe chromatic, spatial and temporal parameters of the chosen\nstimuli closely matched the study by Ruppertsberg et al. (2003) since\nunder these conditions, S-cone modulations do not contribute to global\nmotion perception. This means that with S-cone isolating stimuli (i.e.,\nno L-M-cone input), observers are not able to perform the task.\nObserver isoluminance\nThere are individual differences in the luminous efficiency (V(\u0002);\nWyszecki & Stiles, 2000), which may result in a small luminance\nsignal being present in the nominally isoluminant chromatic\nsignals. In order to adjust for observers\u2019 individual point of\nisoluminance, we used heterochromatic flicker photometry (HCFP;\nWalsh, 1958) for each individual observer, following the same\nprocedure as described in Ruppertsberg et al. (2003).\nThe display altered between a red and a green stimulus at a\n20-Hz frequency. By varying the luminance of red and green in\nopposite directions, it is possible to find a setting for which the\nperception of flicker is minimal. HCFP uses the fact that the\nchromatic system is too slow to follow fast temporal changes, but\nthe luminance system is able to detect the fast changing luminance\ndifferences between red and green. Therefore, if the perception of\nflicker is minimized, the luminance difference is minimized as\nwell. Since temporal and spatial factors may affect the individual\nisoluminance point, we used stimuli as similar as possible to the\ntemporal and spatial layout of our global motion task\u2014We used\na screen with 300 Gaussian blobs and same display settings as\ndescribed in \u2018\u2018Stimuli\u2019\u2019 section. All observers reported that they\ncould find a setting where the flicker almost completely dis-\nappeared. Each observer repeated this selection five times reliably,\nand the average was taken.\nA second factor that may influence performance in a motion\ntask is chromatic aberration. Chromatic aberration can result in\nluminance artifacts, which then could provide an effective input to\nmotion processing or could act as a cue for segmentation. These\nluminance artifacts covary with S-cone modulation. To minimize\nthe effect of chromatic aberration, the RDKs in our study consisted\nof Gaussian blobs instead of uniform discs, hence removing high\u2013\nspatial frequency information. Furthermore, in the baseline exper-\niment (discussed in the next section), we confirm that the colors\n(C1, defined by S-cone increment, and C2, S-cone decrement)\nused in the main experiment did not produce significantly different\nperformances when used in single RDKs. This makes an effect of\nchromatic aberration unlikely in the present experiment, which is\nalso consistent with previous findings using S-cone isolating\nstimuli in a motion extraction task under comparable spatial and\ntemporal parameters (Wuerger & Landy, 1993).\nBaseline experiment\nThe choice of our stimulus colors (C1 and C2; Fig. 1) is based on\nthe results of Ruppertsberg et al. (2003) who showed that for the\nFig. 2. (Color online) (a) RDK, with 0, 50, or 100% coherence. (b) Trial\noutlook\u2014The number of blobs is reduced for the sake of clarity. In this\nexample, the condition is cued correlated, with signal color being C1\n(magenta). This is reflected by the color of the cue.\n240 Martinovic et al.\ngiven spatial and temporal parameters, S-cone modulations did not\nprovide an effective input to global motion processing and the\nperformance in the global motion task was mediated by the\nprojections onto the L-M axis (i.e., there is no significant difference\nin contrast thresholds for colors with the same L-M component).\nWe therefore first replicated a subset of experiments by Rupperts-\nberg et al. (2003) with a new set of observers, using the same spatial\nand temporal parameters as in the original study.\nWe used single-color RDKs to establish how effective different\ncolor modulations are when viewed in isolation. To determine\nchromatic contrast thresholds for global motion discrimination for\neach of the two color directions (modulations from gray back-\nground to C1 or C2; Fig. 1a), we used a two-interval forced-choice\n(2IFC) design in which participants had to decide whether the first\nor the second interval contained coherent motion irrespective of its\ndirection. RDKs contained 300 blobs of a single color; both C1 and\nC2 contrasts were controlled by their own interleaved staircases. In\none interval, the direction of coherent motion was either leftward or\nrightward; in the other interval, all blobs moved randomly. A trial\nstarted with a fixation cross for 500 ms, presented in the center of\nthe screen, then the first motion interval was displayed for 350 ms,\nfollowed by another fixation cross for 500 ms, and finally the\nsecond motion interval appeared for 350 ms. Participants were\nrequired to respond after the second motion interval by pressing\na button to indicate the interval in which they thought coherent\nmotion had appeared. The next trial started after the participant had\nresponded. Participants were instructed to give a correct answer,\nnot a fast answer, and they were provided with acoustic feedback.\nThe participant\u2019s responses guided an adaptive adjustment of\nthe signal contrast (Quest procedure; Watson & Pelli, 1983). To\nestimate the color contrast threshold from the relative frequency of\na correct response, we fitted a Weibull function to obtain the\nthreshold contrast (defined as the 75% correct point on the psy-\nchometric function). Every threshold was measured five times for\neach participant. The means of these measurements are shown in\nFig. 3 in a polar plot corresponding to the colors depicted in Fig. 1a.\nA radius of 1 indicates a cone contrast of 0.13 along the L-M axis,\nand a contrast of 0.7 along the S-cone axis (for details, see \u2018\u2018General\nMethods\u2019\u2019 section, Color space). Contrast thresholds in color\ndirections C1 and C2, defined by hue angles of 45 and 315 deg,\nrespectively, were approximately symmetric around the L-M axis.\nUsing a paired t-test, we confirmed that there were no significant\ndifferences in color contrast thresholds, C1: 1.056 0.05, C2: 1.146\n0.07, t(11) 5 \u00021.84, n.s. Modulations along the S-cone axis only\n(90 and 270 deg) did not yield above-chance motion discrimination\nperformance; that is, we could not generate an S-cone contrast large\nenough to yield reliable motion discrimination performance. The\nmeasured contrast thresholds shown in Fig. 3 show that colors C1\nand C2 are approximately equally effective in our motion discrim-\nination task. These measurements replicate published results by\nRuppertsberg et al. (2003; Fig. 2). Our baseline experiment there-\nfore confirms that only the L-M component in colors C1 and C2\nprovides a useful input to a motion mechanism.\nThe purpose of the baseline experiment was to select isolu-\nminant chromatic stimuli, modulated simultaneously along the\nL-M- and the S-cone axis (C1 and C2 in Fig. 1) such that (1) the\nS-cone component in isolation cannot be used for motion discrim-\nination and (2) modulations between the gray background and the\nparticular color contrast (C1 and C2) are equally effective in our\nglobal motion task. In subsequent experiments, these contrast\nthresholds (Fig. 3) are used to generate the two-color RDKs for\neach of the participants.\nFig. 3. (Color online) Results from the baseline experiment using single-color RDKs. The diamonds indicate the contrast at which\nobservers can reliably discriminate coherent (50%) from random motion. A radius of 1 corresponds to a cone contrast of 0.13 along the\nL-M axis and to a cone contrast of 0.7 along the S-cone axis (for details, see \u2018\u2018General Methods\u2019\u2019 section and Fig. 1). Dotted lines indicate\nthe average L-M coordinate. Two color directions (C1: 45 deg and C2: 315 deg) were tested. Observer names are indicated next to the data\nthrough a four-letter code (three letters for initials and last letter for gender).\nGrouping by S-cone signals 241\nExperiment 1: Correlating color and motion\ninformation\u2014psychophysics\nThe purpose of this experiment was to evaluate whether observers\ncan use the correlation between the color and the direction of local\nmotion signals in a global motion task. In other words, we tested\nwhether the color of the local motion signals can act as a cue to\nsegment the stochastic motion stimulus into coherent motion and\nmotion noise and thereby improve performance.\nParticipants\nThe study included 12 participants, all of whom had normal or\ncorrected-to-normal vision. We tested participants\u2019 color vision\nwith the Cambridge Colour Test (Cambridge Research System,\nLtd.). The participants received a small honorarium to compensate\nfor their time. Each participant performed four 1-h sessions,\nfollowing the 1.5-h session that consisted of control measurements\n(color test and HCFP), the baseline experiment, and several practice\nblocks to prepare them for the main experiment (criterion: d9. 1).\nIndividual written informed consent was obtained, and the study\nconformed to the ethical guidelines of the University of Liverpool.\nStimuli and procedure\nParticipants were presented with two-color RDKs that contained\n150 magenta (C1; cf. Fig. 1) and 150 orange (C2) blobs. Per-\nformance was measured for the following three conditions:\n(1) The \u2018\u2018uncorrelated\u2019\u2019 condition: Direction of each local motion\nsignal is assigned randomly. Fifty percent of the signal blobs\n(i.e., coherent motion) are of color C1, and the other half is\nof color C2; similarly for the noise blobs. Thus, there is no\ninformation about the motion direction associated with\na particular color.\n(2) The \u2018\u2018correlated, but uncued\u2019\u2019 condition: Motion and color are\ncorrelated; all blobs that move coherently (\u2018\u2018signal blobs\u2019\u2019)\nare of color C1 (C2); all blobs that move randomly (\u2018\u2018noise\nblobs\u2019\u2019) are of color C2 (C1). The observer has no prior\nknowledge which color is the signal color (cf. Fig. 1b).\n(3) The \u2018\u2018correlated cued\u2019\u2019 condition: Motion and color are\ncorrelated, and the observer is cued to the signal color.\nConditions were run blocked, with each block containing 90 trials\n(half of them coherent and the other half random motion). The\ntask of the observer was to determine whether the stimulus\ncontained random or coherent motion (always 50% coherence;\nFig. 2a) and respond by pressing an assigned button on the response\nbox. We used a coherent\u2013random global motion judgment instead of\na forced-choice paradigm (2IFC, as in the baseline experiment) in\norder to facilitate comparisons with the EEG study (Experiment 2)\nand with study by Li and Kingdom (2001), which also used a single-\ntrial motion task and examined at measures of accuracy instead of\nchanges of threshold.\nDepending on the condition, they were asked to selectively\nattend to both colors (magenta: C1 and orange: C2) or solely to\nmagenta (C1) or orange (C2). Each trial started with a fixation\ntarget. After a 100-ms period of fixation, the color cue was\npresented for 500 ms; the cue was followed by a variable period of\nfixation (750\u2013950 ms), after which the participants observed\na single 350-ms interval of global motion (for trial outlook, see\nFig. 2b). Participants were instructed to fixate the cross and to avoid\nany eye movements during the motion interval. The color cue\nconsisted of a static image containing a random field of 300 blobs,\ndepicted in the to-be-attended color(s); it was presented in every\ntrial in order to remind the participants of the to-be-attended\ncolor(s). In the \u2018\u2018uncorrelated motion\u2019\u2019 and the \u2018\u2018uncued correlated\nmotion\u2019\u2019 blocks, the cue was half orange (C2) and half magenta\n(C1) and thus not informative about the signal color; in \u2018\u2018cued\ncorrelated motion\u2019\u2019 blocks, the trials were preceded by a fully\nmagenta or a fully orange cue (depending on whether C1 or C2 was\nto be cued in that particular block) and thus was informative about\nthe signal color.\nThe first 10 trials of each block were considered to be\npractice and discarded from the final analysis. The participants\nperformed a total of three blocks per condition, producing 240\ntrials each for the final analysis. The order of the blocks was\ndifferent for each participant; it was balanced across the sample,\nso that each condition occupied the same position an equal\nnumber of times.\nBehavioral data analysis\nWe computed d9 for each of the three different conditions by\npooling the responses from different blocks and then averaging\nacross colors. To determine the effects of color\u2013motion correla-\ntions, we analyzed the d9 values with a repeated measures analysis\nof variance comprising the factor of color\u2013motion correlation\nwith three levels (uncorrelated, \u2018\u2018uncued correlated,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018cued\ncorrelated\u2019\u2019).\nThe task in Experiment 1 required a judgment of motion within\na single interval, which is somewhat different from the 2IFC\nprocedure that was used to equate the chromatic contrasts of C1\nand C2 in the baseline experiment. Therefore, we also conducted\nan additional control condition, wherein the participants per-\nformed the single-interval judgment on single-color RDKs\ndepicted fully in C1 or C2 (80 trials; 40 for C1 and 40 for C2).\nIf the performance in this control experiment is not different for\nthe two colors C1 and C2, this verifies that the two colors are\napproximately equally effective in the global motion task. This\nwas tested by contrasting the d9s for C1 and C2 against each other\nas well as against the uncorrelated condition using paired t-tests.\nMeans and s.e. are reported throughout. Planned post hoc tests were\nperformed using paired t-tests.\nResults\nFig. 4a shows performance (d9; Macmillan & Creelman, 1991) for the\nthree experimental conditions (uncorrelated, \u2018\u2018correlated-uncued,\u2019\u2019\nand \u2018\u2018correlated cued\u2019\u2019) and also for the single-color RDK (\u2018\u2018con-\ntrol\u2019\u2019) averaged over all observers. The data for the two-color RDK\nare shown with bipartite symbols; the d9 for the single-color RDKs\n(CONTROL) is indicated by the filled symbol. Comparing the\nd9 for the three main conditions shows that correlating the color and\nthe local motion signals has an effect on global motion perfor-\nmance, F(2, 22) 5 6.48; P , 0.01. When there was a correlation\nbetween color and motion and the observer was cued to the signal\ncolor (i.e., the color that is associated with 100% coherent motion;\nCORR-C), then the improvement in performance compared to the\nuncorrelated case (UNCORR) was highly significant, cued d9 5\n1.75 6 0.14; t(11) 5 \u00024.29; P , 0.001. There was a strong trend\nfor improvement in performance when color and motion of the\nlocal signals were correlated but the observer was not cued to the\nsignal color, uncorrelated d9: 1.49 6 0.13; uncued correlated d9:\n1.63 6 0.11; t(11) 5 \u00022.07, P 5 0.06. The difference between\n242 Martinovic et al.\nuncued and cued correlated conditions itself was not significant,\nt(11) 5 \u00021.37, n.s. There were no significant differences in\nperformance for single-color RDKs, C1: d9 5 1.49 6 0.11, C2:\nd9 5 1.30 6 0.12, t(10) 5 1.51, n.s., and the difference between\nsingle-color RDKs (filled symbol) and uncorrelated two-color\nRDKs (bipartite symbol; \u2018\u2018uncorr\u2019\u2019 condition) was also not\nsignificant.\nFig. 4b summarizes the effects of color\u2013motion correlation that\noccur automatically or through cueing by replotting the data from\nFig. 4a and showing the difference in performance (d9) due to\na correlation between color and motion only [\u2018\u2018CORRELATION\u2019\u2019;\ndiff d9 5 d9(correlated, but uncued) \u0002 d9(uncorrelated)] or due to\ncueing of the signal color [\u2018\u2018CUEING\u2019\u2019; diff d95 d9(correlated and\ncued)\u0002 d9(correlated, but uncued)] or due to correlation and cueing\n[\u2018\u2018CORR + CUEING\u2019\u2019; diff d9 5 d9(correlated and cued) \u0002\nd9(uncorrelated)]. On their own, correlation and cueing result in\na performance improvement of about 0.1\u20130.15 d9. The combined\neffect of cueing and correlation is shown in the last column and is\nabout 0.25 d9 difference and highly significant.\nIn summary, the behavioral experiment showed that observers\ncan use an S-cone difference to segment motion noise and\ncoherent motion; this grouping by color (defined by an S-cone\ndifference) is highly significant when the observer is cued to the\nsignal color.\nExperiment 2: Neural markers of color cueing\nrevealed with EEG\nThe purpose of this experiment was to determine the neural\nmarkers of the cueing effect demonstrated in Experiment 1. We\ntherefore used similar stimuli as in the psychophysical experiment\n(Experiment 1) while recording EEG for uncued and cued RDKs.\nParticipants\nEight participants were recruited; four of them had previously\nparticipated in Experiment 1. They had normal or corrected-\nto-normal vision. We tested participants\u2019 color vision with the\nCambridge Colour Test (Cambridge Research System, Ltd.). The\nparticipants received a small honorarium to compensate for their\ntime. The experiment consisted of one initial hour and a half\nsession (color test, HCFP, and baseline experiment) and a 1-h EEG\nexperiment. Individual written informed consent was obtained,\nand the study conformed to the ethical guidelines of the University\nof Liverpool.\nStimuli and procedure\nWe aimed to keep the experimental stimuli and procedure as sim-\nilar to Experiment 1 as possible. However, due to the necessities of\nadapting our psychophysical approach to EEG methods, several\nsignificant changes had to be introduced.\nFirst, the chromatic contrast levels for each participant were\nnot fixed at threshold but scaled from C1 and C2 thresholds to\na mean radius of 1.4 (see \u2018\u2018General Methods\u2019\u2019 section, Color\nspace) according to the following formula: (C1_scaled 5 1.4 3\nC1_threshold\/((C1_threshold + C2_threshold)\/2)), similarly for\ncolor C2. This was done in order to increase the amount of\nmeasurable electrical activity because the amplitude of ERPs to\nisoluminant colored stimuli is contrast dependent (Porciatti &\nSartucci, 1999). The value of 1.4 was selected as it was clearly\nabove threshold but still within the gamut of our monitor. While\nabove threshold chromatic contrasts may lead to ceiling perfor-\nmance in the behavioral task, attentional effects on the early ERP\ncomponents are likely to persist (Valdes-Sosa et al., 1998), which\nvalidates our approach.\nSecond, we changed the task so that instead of judging whether\nmotion was coherent or random, participants had to discriminate\nthe direction (up or down, left or right) of coherent motion and\nindicate it by pressing the appropriate button on the response box.\nThis was again done in order to increase the quality of the signal;\nthe waveforms elicited by random and coherent motion cannot be\naveraged together, so that would lead to an effective loss of one\nhalf of recorded trials. With a motion direction task, all correctly\nFig. 4. Behavioral findings from Experiment 1. (a) Motion discrimination sensitivity (d9) showed a significant difference between\ncorrelated uncued (CORR-U) and correlated cued (CORR-C) conditions. (b) Data are replotted as differences in d9. The effect of color\u2013\nmotion correlation is demonstrated by subtracting uncorrelated from correlated uncued; the effect of cueing is shown by subtracting\ncorrelated uncued from correlated cued. Mean values are plotted with 2 s.e.\nGrouping by S-cone signals 243\nanswered trials could be taken into analysis, which greatly\nenhances our signal-to-noise ratio.\nThird, we did not include the uncorrelated motion condition\nand focused instead on differences between uncued and cued\ncorrelated. This was done due to time constraints; with our EEG\nsetup, a recording of more than 1 h is not viable. As the physical\nstimuli are identical in uncued and cued conditions, any differ-\nences between them would be clearly interpretable as arising due\nto cueing and not to a difference in the stimulus itself. Further-\nmore, as previously mentioned, attentional effects are manifest in\nearly ERP components even if there is no difference in perfor-\nmance (e.g., Valdes-Sosa et al., 1998).\nAnd finally, in this experiment, we asked for a speeded and\naccurate response, as EEG experiments usually rely on time-limited\ntrials. In Experiment 1, accuracy was demanded as this is optimal\nwhen d9s are computed. However, in EEG, it is necessary to speed up\nthe experiment as it needs to finish within a single recording; also,\none must avoid long periods of visual inactivity, which can lead to\nhigh levels of alpha activity in the EEG. Variable levels of alpha\nactivity before trials would introduce a large amount of noise to early\nvisual ERPs (for an overview, see Becker et al., 2008).\nParticipants were instructed to minimize eye movements and\nblinking during the display of a stimulus or the fixation cross and to\ntry and remain relaxed and refrain from body or head movements\nthroughout the experiment. At the end of each trial, an \u2018\u2018X\u2019\u2019 would\nreplace the fixation cross for 900 ms\u2014Participants were instructed\nthat they are allowed to blink during the presentation of the X.\nBehavioral data analysis\nWe measured performance as percentage of correct responses and\nreaction times (RTs) for data collapsed across color. To determine\nthe effects of color cueing, we compared accuracies and RTs from\ncorrelated uncued and correlated cued motion with paired t-tests.\nAccuracies were calculated instead of d9 as a more appropriate\nmeasure since data were based on four alternative responses.\nEEG data acquisition and analysis\nContinuous EEG was recorded with an EGI (Electrical Geodesics,\nInc., Eugene, OR) 129-electrode array. Vertical and horizontal eye\nmovements were monitored with a subset of the electrodes. Elec-\ntrode impedances were kept below 50 k\u0002 as recommended by the\nsystem manufacturer, and all scalp electrodes were referenced to\nthe vertex during the recording. All signals were bandpass filtered\nonline from 0.1 to 100 Hz and digitized at 250 Hz. EEG was\nsegmented into epochs starting 500 ms prior and lasting 700 ms\nfollowing stimulus onset. EEG data processing was performed us-\ning the EEGlab toolbox (Delorme & Makeig, 2004) combined with\nself-written procedures running under Matlab (The Mathworks,\nInc., Natick, MA). Artifact removal was performed using an es-\ntablished procedure [statistical correction of artifacts in dense array\nstudies (SCADS); Junghoefer et al., 2000]. When artifact rejection\nwas completed, the average rejection rate was 32.8%, resulting in\nan average of approximately 44 remaining trials per condition for\neach subject. Further analyses were performed using the average\nreference.\nWe also assessed the number of trials with eye movements\nprior to artifact rejection as eye movements are known to play\na significant role in motion perception. We used a criterion of\n50-\u0003V voltage deflection on either vertical electrooculograms\n(VEOGs) or horizontal electrooculograms (HEOGs), which is an\naccepted procedure (for a review, see Croft & Barry, 2000). The\ncomputations were performed on subtracted signal recorded above\nand below the eyes (VEOGs) or at the left and right outer canthi of\nthe eyes (HEOGs) between 200 ms before and 350 ms after motion\nonset.\nA 25-Hz low-pass filter was applied to the data before all ERP\nanalyses. We assessed the N1 component of the ERP. Regional\nmeans (shown in Fig. 5; see \u2018\u2018Results\u2019\u2019 section) were assigned\nbased on which electrodes exhibited maximal activity when data\nwere collapsed across conditions. Average amplitudes across the\nelectrodes at these sites in the time window of maximal activity\n(170\u2013290 ms) were then computed, and the mean amplitude during\nthe 100-ms period prior to stimulus onset (baseline) was subtracted\n(these are all common procedures in the analyses of ERPs; Handy,\n2005). Mean latencies were not analyzed as there were no hypoth-\neses concerning them. Differences in amplitude between uncued and\ncued correlated motion were analyzed with a paired t-test.\nTo reconstruct the estimated sources of the observed effects\nthe VARETA (Variable Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography)\nmethod was used (for a detailed description, see Bosch-Bayard\net al., 2001). In brief, VARETA estimates the spatially smoothest\ngenerator estimates compatible with the observed scalp topogra-\nphies and places anatomical constraints on the allowable solutions.\nThe generators of the EEG data inside the brain are mapped using\na three-dimensional grid of points (or voxels) that represent possible\nsources of the signal and for which the probability for gray matter is\ndifferent from 0 (based on the average probabilistic brain atlas\nproduced by the Montreal Neurological Institute; Evans et al.,\n1993). In order to reveal possible differences in activation due to the\nsignal color being cued, sources were analyzed for both cued and\nuncued conditions. Statistical parametric maps were constructed\nbased on voxel by voxel Hotelling T2-tests against zero. Activation\nthreshold was set at a significance level of P , 0.01; correction to\naccount for spatial dependencies between voxels was calculated by\nmeans of Random Field Theory (Worsley et al., 1996).\nResults\nThe purpose of the EEG experiment was to identify the neural\nmarker of cued color\u2013motion correlations. In the EEG measure-\nments, we observed a prominent N1 component at central\nparietooccipital sites (Fig. 5a). This posterior N1 showed an effect\nof color cueing, t(7) 5 3.32, P , 0.05, being enhanced when the\nsignal color had been cued (Fig. 5b). Cued and uncued conditions\nshowed differing levels of activation in a broad area of extrastriate\nvisual cortex, encompassing the lateral occipitotemporal, lingual,\nand superior occipital gyrus, with cued colors also causing\nsignificant levels of activity in middle temporal (MT) area (Fig. 5c;\nBET Viewer, Neuronic, S.A., Cuba).\nDuring the EEG experiment, we also collected behavioral data\n(performance and RTs). Performance (percent correct) in the cued\ncondition is slightly better than in the uncued condition, uncued:\n80.5% correct with a s.e. of 3.7%; cued: 82.8% correct with a s.e.\nof 3.7%; t(7) 5 \u00020.99, n.s. Similarly, RTs are slightly faster in the\ncued condition, but this difference is again not significant, uncued:\nRT5 0.82 s with a s.e. of 0.028 s; cued: RT5 0.80 s with a s.e. of\n0.032 s; t(7) 5 0.58, n.s. Since the EEG experiment was not run at\nthreshold but at suprathreshold contrast levels, we did not neces-\nsarily expect significant behavioral results due to ceiling effects\n(Valdes-Sosa et al., 1998). Moreover, significant differences be-\ntween cued and uncued correlated motion were not obtained in\nExperiment 1 either.\n244 Martinovic et al.\nEye movement analysis was conducted in six of eight partic-\nipants, as in the remaining two participants, SCADS had identified\nexcessive artifacts in one of the HEOG channels. Eye movements\nhad occurred on a very small number of trials for each of the six\nparticipants whose data were analyzed: 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.3, and\n0.23% for uncued motion, and 0.1, 0.3, 0.3, 0.5, 0.12 and 0.13%\nfor cued motion. There was no significant difference between\nconditions, t(5) 5 0.32, n.s. Thus, participants generally followed\nthe instructions to maintain central fixation and avoid eye move-\nments during the motion interval.\nDiscussion\nWe studied whether the human visual system uses correlations\nbetween color and motion to segregate coherent motion from\nmotion noise. The novelty of our approach is that we dissociated\nthe information available to the motion system from the informa-\ntion available to a color processing module using coherent motion\nand motion noise that differed from each other only in their S-cone\ncomponent. Any segregation of coherent motion from motion noise\nmust therefore rely on the S-cone difference, and any additional\nfacilitation can only act on this S-cone\u2013driven color difference.\nFurthermore, since the S-cone signal is invisible to the motion\nsystem under the parameters we have used, any improvement due\nto color\u2013motion correlation cannot be due to sensory gain in the\nmotion signal and has to operate through grouping by color.\nOur main result is that color\u2013motion correlations can improve\nperformance, in particular if cued. This improvement can only be\nexplained by grouping the local motion signals according to their\ncolor and thereby aiding segmentation of motion signal and motion\nnoise. Such facilitation requires that the S-cone\u2013driven koniocel-\nlular pathway can affect the processing of local motion informa-\ntion before it is analyzed in MT. Time courses of color and motion\nprocessing support this possibility: Color is analyzed prior to the\nprocessing of local motion signals (Moutoussis & Zeki, 1997). Our\nEEG experiment focused on differences between cued and uncued\ncorrelated motion, which did not emerge in the behavioral exper-\niment. Enhancements for cued color\u2013motion correlations were\nfound at approximately 240 ms, in the time range of the early\nvisual component N1. N1 reflects the discrimination process within\nattentional focus, and enhancements have been previously reported\nfor spatial-based attention (Vogel & Luck, 2000). We now report\nenhancements that may be due to nonspatial attention.\nGrouping of local motion signals based on S-cone information\nWe found a small and automatic improvement in performance\n(about 0.15 d9) when color and motion direction of local motion\nsignals were correlated (Fig. 4). This is consistent with evidence\nthat color and local motion are bound automatically and at an early\nstage of processing (Blaser et al., 2005). The small improvement for\ncorrelated RDKs (Fig. 4a) would fit within this approach, which\nsupposes joint processing of color and motion if they form a surface.\nSurfaces have the properties of an emergent object; it is considered\nthat such emergent objects can capture attention (Wolfe, 1998). Thus,\nit is conceivable that observers rapidly extract some information\nabout the signal color (i.e., the color of all coherently moving blobs),\nwhich then acts like a cue and facilitates subsequent motion\nprocessing (within the same trial) by grouping the local motion\nsignals carrying the signal color. On the contrary, it is not likely that\ninformation about motion coherence would be extracted prior to\nidentifying the blobs\u2019 common color and used to drive the color\u2013\nmotion binding process, as isoluminant motion stimuli are not\navailable preattentively and thus cannot capture attention (Lu\u00a8schow\n& Nothdurft, 1993). However, the binding of local motion signals\npossessing the signal color is not efficient, as the surface is emerging\nin the unfavorable context of other colocalized randomly moving\nFig. 5.

The Y-coordinate represents the location of the coronal slice in MNI space. Significant voxels are depicted in black.\nGrouping by S-cone signals 245\nblobs. Whether coherent local motion signals are bound into one\nglobal surface depends strongly on the spatial configuration of the\nlocal signals (Lorenceau & Alais, 2001); the random distribution of\nblobs has a negative effect on the formation of local borders (Wolfe,\n1998) and thus hinders the emergence of the surface. This could\nexplain why the observed increases were small.\nLi and Kingdom (2001) failed to show a significant effect of\ncolor\u2013motion correlation for red\u2013green RDKs without cueing. In\ntheir study, a strong luminance signal was available for motion\nprocessing, and coherent motion and motion noise were associated\nwith different colors (red and green). The fact that we find a trend\nfor an improvement through color\u2013motion correlation may be due\nto very different experimental conditions; we investigated whether\nS-cone signals can modulate global motion processing, whereas Li\nand Kingdom (2001) used RDKs with strong luminance signals and\nadditional chromatic information. In our experiment, no luminance\ninformation was provided, and the motion information was carried\nexclusively by a chromatic (L-M) signal. It is conceivable that the\nrelative effect of grouping based on color carries larger weight\nwhen the motion signal is poor. This is supported by the findings of\nThiele et al. (1999) that chromatic contrast can influence direction\nresponses in area MT only when luminance contrast of the motion\nstimulus is very low (smaller than 5\u20138% contrast). Otherwise, the\nresponse is dominated by the luminance component.\nIn accordance with Li and Kingdom (2001), we found that\ncueing the signal color leads to significantly improved performance\n(Fig. 4). Li and Kingdom (2001) remarked that the enhancements\nintroduced by endogenous attentional focusing in a global motion\ntask were smaller and less consistent than those brought about by\ncolor-driven pop-out in the study by Croner and Albright (1997).\nIn the study by Li and Kingdom (2001), only two of a total of five\nobservers exhibited significant, albeit small, increases in perfor-\nmance when color-based attentional selection was used. Unlike Li\nand Kingdom (2001), in our behavioral experiment, we used color\ncontrasts at threshold for each observer (determined in the baseline\nexperiment; Fig. 3) in our much larger sample. In doing so, we\ndiscovered that although the effect of cueing is indeed small, it is\nhighly significant, which clearly demonstrates that such improve-\nments do occur in chromatic global motion integration. Indeed, our\nfinding parallels the results of Khoe et al. (2005) who obtained small\neffects of surface-based exogenous attention in a paradigm that\nrelied on two surfaces of moving dots. An improvement of 0.68 of\nd9 was observed when surfaces were segregated by two cues (color\nand direction of rotary motion) but an improvement of only 0.23 of\nd9 occurred when surfaces were segregated through a single cue.\nTherefore, our findings seem to be in accordance with a large\nbody of existing literature and provide further support for the\nassertion by Li and Kingdom (2001) that color\u2013motion correla-\ntions are effective because of attentional involvement. However,\ncaution also needs to be taken when interpreting our results along\nthese lines. The slight improvement in performance brought\nabout by uncued color\u2013motion correlations could have indeed\nbeen due to the ability of uniformly colored surfaces to capture\nattention, as discussed above. Still, exogenous attention was not\ntested directly so its involvement cannot be definitely asserted. In\naddition, although cueing the signal color in a color\u2013motion\ncorrelated RDK did produce an improvement in performance in\nrelation to an uncorrelated display (Experiment 1), no behavioral\ndifference was observed between cued and uncued RDKs in either\nof the two experiments. This requires caution when interpreting\nthe improvement in discrimination to be due to endogenous\nattention.\nThe neural processing of cued color\u2013motion correlations\nEEG allows us to look at subtler modulations that may occur\nbetween the cued and the uncued correlated motion. Modulations\nof EEG responses indicative of attention may be found even when\nperformance improvements are lacking (e.g., Valdes-Sosa et al.,\n1998; Mu\u00a8ller et al., 2006). In our global motion direction task, we\nidentified a difference between cued and uncued correlated motion\nat approximately 240 ms, at the level of the early visual N1\ncomponent. This is the name given to the first negative component\nof the ERP waveform evoked by a visual stimulus. The informa-\ntion-processing correlates of this component are not yet fully\nunderstood, although it is generally considered to reflect a visual\ndiscrimination process and its modulation by attention. The visual\ndiscrimination may involve color, form, or motion, demonstrating\nthat N1 effects are generally similar for both ventral and dorsal\nstream information (for an overview, see Vogel & Luck, 2000).\nUsing a stimulus display of two differently colored rotary surfaces,\na previous study has found an enhancement of N1 amplitude\nthrough exogenous surface\u2013based attention (Khoe et al., 2005).\nThis enhancement occurred at around 200 ms and showed a topog-\nraphy that was distributed with left and right symmetrical occipital\nfoci. Khoe et al. (2005) remarked that this cueing effect on the N1\nwas similar to that reported by the Valdes-Sosa group (Valdes-Sosa\net al., 2004; Rodriguez & Valdes-Sosa, 2006) and localized to\na ventral\u2013lateral occipital source in the general region of areas\nMT\/middle superior temporal area (MST) and V4. Our N1 occurred\nsomewhat later, at 240 ms, and exhibited a midline occipital\ntopography (Fig. 5a). The differences in the topography are slight\nand may originate in the fact that we used a fully isoluminant\nstimulus display, with sole stimulus modulations exciting the\nS-cones and thus being carried along the koniocellular pathway.\nIndeed, our ERP waveforms are consistent with those for S-cone\nisolating stimuli, obtained in the normative study of Porciatti and\nSartucci (1999). Source localization has indicated that activity in\nour experiment was generated by widespread sources, including\na range of visual areas (e.g., lateral occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus,\nsuperior occipital gyrus). After thresholding the activations, it was\nrevealed that an important difference arose in area MT, which was\nsignificantly active when the signal color was cued (Fig. 5c). We\nconclude that the N1 effect may reflect a more effective discrim-\nination process possibly due to endogenous attentional modulation.\nThis process distinguishes itself from automatic color\u2013motion cor-\nrelation processing by a significant involvement of the high-level\nvisual area MT\/MST, which indicates that it must occur after the\nbinding of color and local motion.\nA contribution of eye movements to the observed effects has to\nbe considered as well, as dot lifetime was unlimited and trial\nduration of 350 ms allowed a possibility of tracking eye move-\nments being initiated. Smooth pursuit eye movements play a very\nsignificant role in motion perception; motion direction judgments\nand pursuit eye movements correlate with each other and both\nhave a neural substrate in area MT (for a review, see Spering &\nGegenfurtner, 2008). Such eye movements are initiated within 80\u2013\n150 ms in humans, although their latency is delayed by 50 ms when\nisoluminant stimuli are used (Braun et al., 2008). While the early\npart (0\u201340 ms) of smooth pursuit eye movements seems indepen-\ndent of stimulus features and reliant on luminance signals, the late\ncomponent that follows a catch-up saccade is dependent on the\nproperties of the stimulus (Tychsen & Lisberger, 1986; Wilmer &\nNakayama, 2007). Can a modulation of smooth pursuit eye move-\nments be responsible for the motion\u2013color correlation effects\n246 Martinovic et al.\nobtained in this study? As our motion stimulus differed only along\nthe S-cone dimension, it is unlikely that our findings are influenced\nby any of the early presaccadic components of pursuit eye move-\nments that are driven by luminance changes. In order to assess the\npossibility of postsaccadic influences, we performed additional\nanalyses on electrooculogram (EOG) signals collected in Experi-\nment 2, using more stringent criteria for detecting eye movements.\nWe found that large eye movements were present on a very few\nnumber of trials (above 10% overall only for one of the partic-\nipants), indicating that the instructions to fixate were followed\nsuccessfully. Most importantly, there were no differences in eye\nmovements between cued and uncued motion. One must consider\nthat EOGs are not an ideal tool in assessing eye movements unless\nthey are calibrated for each participant (Croft & Barry, 2000). Still,\nthe robustness of our findings between conditions indicates that\ncueing of S-cone\u2013defined motion does not automatically induce\nprominent postsaccadic smooth pursuit eye movements in partic-\nipants who are instructed to fixate during a brief motion interval.\nThe role of S-cone signals in global motion processing\nWhereas the role of the parvocellular pathway in motion process-\ning has been demonstrated by numerous physiological and\nbehavioral studies (for a review, see Cropper & Wuerger, 2005),\nthe role of the S-cone\u2013driven koniocellular pathway for global\nmotion processing is less clear. Recent neuroanatomical results are\nintriguing since they show direct projections from the nucleus\ngeniculatus lateralis dorsalis (LGN) to extrastriate areas (MT\/MST)\nthat are traditionally considered as motion processing areas\n(Morand et al., 2000; Sincich et al., 2004; Sincich & Horton,\n2005); interestingly, these projections arise from the (S-cone driven)\nkoniocellular layers of LGN. There is plenty of evidence that it is\npossible to extract global motion from S-cone isolating stimuli\n(Ruppertsberg et al., 2007; Michna & Mullen, 2008). At the same\ntime, behavioral data show that S-cone isolating stimuli are very\npoor at mediating effective motion extraction (Ruppertsberg et al.,\n2003) and S-cones support global motion perception only at low\nspatial frequencies (Ruppertsberg et al., 2007). These behavioral\ndata in conjunction with imaging and neurophysiological data\n(Gegenfurtner & Hawken, 1996; Wandell et al., 1999; Gegenfurtner,\n2001) suggest that the role of the koniocellular pathway for low-\nlevel motion processing is probably not very significant.\nIn our behavioral experiment, we eliminated any residual\ndirect input of the S-cone system to global motion processing,\nand we demonstrate a processing advantage when observers are\ncued to the S-cone\u2013driven signal color (i.e., the color carrying\ncoherent motion). Since this effect of color\u2013motion correlations\ncannot be explained by a gain in the local motion signals, it must be\nreliant on a koniocellular feedback into or before the motion\nanalysis systems, once color and local motion have already been\nbound into a single surface. The EEG experiment suggests that the\neffect of cueing is at least partly localized in area MT, a part of the\nbrain whose neurons have relatively large receptive fields (5 deg at\nthe fovea) and respond to planar global motion (Movshon et al.,\n1986). Our results therefore suggest that the role of the koniocel-\nlular pathway in motion processing may not lie in providing a direct\ninput but in selecting the information to be used for further analysis\nbased on the parvo- or magnocellular input.\nThe importance of this study lies in its finding that the\nkoniocellular pathway provides a significant input to global\nmotion analysis via grouping of local motion signals. We found\nboth an automatic improvement in performance brought about by\ncolor\u2013motion correlations and a further benefit due to cueing of\nthe signal color. The first type of improvement could have occurred\ndue to an exogenous attentional process, wherein a salient or new\nstimulus captures attention involuntarily; the second type of\nimprovement could be explained by an additional effect of\nendogenous attention. Both these attentional effects were pre-\nviously suggested by Li and Kingdom (2001) in their attempt to\nexplain the processing of color\u2013motion correlations, though further\nstudies are needed if this attentional involvement is to be demon-\nstrated unequivocally. At this stage, we can conclude that the\nkoniocellular pathway plays an important role in high-level motion\nanalysis by guiding grouping by color and that this role may be\nlinked to the functioning of both exogenous and endogenous\nattentional processes.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was funded by a Wellcome Trust Project grant (WT080205)\nawarded to S.M.W.
