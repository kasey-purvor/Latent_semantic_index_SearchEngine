Models representing various aspects of \nprocessing have been developed and applied to the majority of processing \ntechniques. Heat transfer models have been implemented in order to simulate the \ncuring phenomena in autoclave processing [1], resin transfer molding [2], pultrusion \n[3] and filament winding [4]. Provided that these models are combined with \nappropriate cure kinetics subroutines [5,6], they offer the ability to calculate the \nspatial distributions of temperature and  of the degree-of-cure and their evolution \nwith time during the curing. Alongside with simulation, process monitoring methods \nsuch as thermal [7], dielectric [8,9], fiber optic [10] and acoustic cure monitoring \n[11], have  begun to be implemented in an industrial environment. \nBoth monitoring and modeling are valuable for optimizing the curing process. \nThe predictive ability of the simulation can be used as a part of the process design, \nwhile monitoring constitutes a potential tool for on line control. However, both \napproaches present some inherent drawbacks. Accurate modeling requires an \nextensive knowledge of material properties and process characteristics. This may be \nimpossible in some cases due to limited reproducibility of some of the process \nconditions, or due to the prohibitive costs associated with the knowledge acquisition \nstep. Similarly, monitoring involves insertion of a sensor in some critical area of the \ncomponent, which composite manufacturers and end users are reluctant to adopt.  \nA method to overcome these limitations arises from a combination of modeling \nand monitoring. In the present paper a scheme which combines heat transfer \nmodeling and cure monitoring is presented. An inversion of the heat transfer model \nbased on a genetic algorithm is applied to data gathered by monitoring, in order to \ncalculate some of the properties. Thus, an estimation of those modeling parameters \nthat are most difficult to predefine can be performed, in accordance with the results \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \nof monitoring. Subsequently the direct model can be solved in order to obtain the \nglobal picture of the cure. \nThe inversion procedure developed here is also applied to purely predictive \nprocess design where the minimization of the cure duration is the objective of the \noptimization.  \n \nDIRECT MODEL \n \nHeat Transfer Problem \n \nThe model concerns the curing of a carbon fiber reinforced composite in a resin \ntransfer mold. In this process dry fabric is placed in a rigid cavity, resin is infused \nunder pressure and vacuum and the curing takes place with further heating of the \nmold. When forced convection does not occur heat conduction is the only heat \ntransfer mechanism relevant to composites cure. Accordingly, the governing \nequation is:  \n ( )\ndt\ndHv1T\nt\nTc totrfp\n\u03b1\u03c1\u03c1 \u2212+\u2207\u22c5\u2207=\u2202\n\u2202 K     (1)   \n The second term in the right side of (1) expresses the heat generated by the \ncuring reaction. This equation is accompanied by a set of boundary conditions. In the \ngeneral case there are three possible boundary conditions: -(i) prescribed \ntemperature: \n ( ) ( ) 1S\u02c6,t,\u02c6Tt,\u02c6T \u2208\u2032= rrr       (2)  \n(ii) prescribed heat flux  \n ( ) ( ) 2S\u02c6,t,\u02c6qt,\u02c6T\u02c6 \u2208\u2032=\u2207\u22c5 rrrKn      (3)  \n(iii) and convection  \n ( ) ( )( ) 3S\u02c6,Tt,\u02c6Tht,\u02c6T\u02c6 \u2208\u2212\u2212=\u2207\u22c5 \u221e rrrKn     (4)  \nAs in composites curing the heat transfer problem is multi-material, i. e. thermal \nproperties and especially thermal conductivity present a discontinuity at the tool-\ncomposite interface, a separate boundary value problem, of the type expressed by \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \nEqs. (1)-(4), is formed over each sub-domain. An additional set of interfacial \nconditions that ensures temperature and heat flux continuity is defined as follows: \n ( ) ( ) ijji S~\u02c6,t,\u02c6Tt,\u02c6T \u2208= rrr       (5) \n ( ) ( ) ijji S~\u02c6,t,\u02c6T\u02c6t,\u02c6T\u02c6 \u2208\u2207\u22c5=\u2207\u22c5 rrKnrKn ji     (6) \nhere the indices i and j denote areas of different materials.  \nEqs. (1)-(6), accompanied by an appropriate cure kinetics model and a set of \nthermal properties models expressing thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity \nand density as functions of degree of cure and temperature, suffice for the complete \ndescription of the curing process in a resin transfer mold. \n    \nFinite Elements Formulation \n \nIn order to solve the problem using finite elements the domain is divided into a \nnumber of elements that connect at G nodal points. The unknown variable is \napproximated as a linear combination of a set of G functions as follows: \n ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1iG\n1i\nii Sift,'TtT,\u02c6NtTT \u2208== \u2211\n=\nii rrr     (7) \nFunction iN  is equal to unity at node i and vanishes at all other nodes and within all \nthe elements to which node i does not connect.  \nBy employing the above approximation, adopting a finite difference scheme to \nexpress time derivatives and expressing the heat transfer problem by its weighted \nresiduals equivalent, the following system of equations is obtained: \n ( ) ( )( ) 0tt1t =\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212+ + FTLMTLM n1n \u2206\u2206\u03b8\u2206\u03b8      (8) \nwhere \n \u222b=\n\u2126\n\u2126\u03c1 dNNcM ijpji        (9) \n \u222b\u222b +\u2207\u22c5\u2207=\n3S\nijijji dShNNdNNL\n\u2126\n\u2126K       (10) \n ( )\u222b\u222b\u222b \u2212++\u2212= \u221e\n\u2126\n\u2126\u03b1\u03c1 d\ndt\ndHv1NdShTNdS'qNF totrfj\nS\nj\nS\njj\n32\n  (11) \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \nThe system of equations described by (8)-(11) can be solved for each time step in \norder to calculate the distributions of temperature and degree of cure and their \nevolution with time.  \n \nModel Implementation and Validation \n \nA model based on the principles described previously was developed in order to \nsimulate the curing stage of resin transfer molding. The model comprises a core \nfinite elements solver and a set of sub-models simulating the cure reaction kinetics, \nand the changes in thermal properties, i.e. specific heat capacity, thermal \nconductivity and density, during the cure. The algorithm starts from the initial \ntemperature and degree of cure distributions which are fed into the cure kinetics \nmodel. The cure kinetics model produces values for the reaction rate which are fed \ninto the finite elements solver in order to account for heat generation and values for \nthe updated degree of cure which are output to the thermal properties sub-models. \nThe three thermal properties sub-models use the values of conversion and initial \ntemperature to compute the values of the thermal properties within the different \nelements of the model. The results are sent to the finite elements solver, which, \ntaking into account the boundary conditions and the initial temperature distributions, \ncomputes the resulting temperature distribution. This procedure is repeated for a \nnumber of time steps by replacing the initial conditions with the temperature output \nof the finite elements model and the updated degree of cure distributions as \ncalculated by the cure kinetics and by updating the boundary conditions.   \nThe model was applied to the curing of an RTM6 epoxy resin\/ T300 continuous \ncarbon fiber reinforced composite. The material properties sub-models were \nappropriate to the specific materials. The cure kinetics model operates by direct \ninterpolation in the degree of cure-temperature phase space applied to experimental \ndifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data and is analyzed in detail elsewhere [5].  \nThe specific heat capacity sub-model operates in a similar way using \nexperimental data produced by modulated differential scanning calorimetry. The \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \nexperimental data for the resin in the temperature-fractional conversion phase space \nare illustrated in Fig. 1. The step change occurring during the cure of the resin marks \nthe glass transition of the thermosetting material. The specific heat capacity of the \ncarbon fiber was found to be a linear function of the temperature as follows: \n765.0T0023.0cp +=         (12) \nIn the above equation the units of temperature are oC and of specific heat capacity \nJ\/g\/oC. Once the values corresponding to the resin and the reinforcement have been \ncomputed by the sub-model the law of mixtures is employed to calculate the value \nfor the composite. \n  \n1.5\n1.6\n1.7\n1.8\n1.9\n2\n2.1\n2.2\n2.3\n2.4\n2.5\n0.00 50.00 100.00 150.00 200.00 250.00\nCure time (min)\nSp\nec\nei\nfic\n h\nea\nt c\nap\nac\nity\n (J\n\/g\n\/\no C\n) 130 \u00b0C 140 \u00b0C 150 \u00b0C 160 \u00b0C\n170 \u00b0C 180 \u00b0C 190 \u00b0C 200 \u00b0C\n \nFIGURE 1 Specific heat capacity versus cure time during isothermal cures  \n \nThe thermal conductivity of the anisotropic composite material is computed using \nan appropriate geometry based model [12] that combines values for the resin and the \ncarbon fiber. The values for the resin were obtained experimentally using a technique \nthat measures the thermal conductivity of the thermoset while it cures. Details of the \nmethod are given elsewhere [13].  The dependence of the resin thermal conductivity \nto temperature and fractional conversion can be expressed as follows: \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \n \n12.022.00937.0T0002.0T0011.0T0008.0K 22 ++\u2212\u2212\u2212= \u03b1\u03b1\u03b1\u03b1   (13)  \n \nwhere temperature is given in oC and thermal conductivity in W\/m\/oC. The \nlongitudinal thermal conductivity of T300 carbon fiber can be expressed as follows \n[14]: \nT0074.08.4K +=          (14) \nwhere temperature is given in oC and thermal conductivity in W\/m\/oC. The radial \nthermal conductivity of T300 carbon fiber is 0.84 W\/m\/oC.  \nThe density model takes into account thermal expansion of the resin and of the \nfiber and curing shrinkage. The model assumes that resin shrinkage is proportional to \nthe progress of the curing reaction and uses the law of mixtures in order to calculate \nthe composite density. The density of uncured RTM6 resin at ambient temperature is \n1.117 g\/cm3 and the total volumetric chemical shrinkage 4.9 %, while the volumetric \nthermal expansion coefficient above glass transition is 4.08 x 10-4 oC-1 and below \nglass transition 1.62 x 10-4 oC-1 [15]. The expansion coefficient of carbon T300 is 5 x \n10-6 oC-1 and its density at ambient temperature 1.8 g\/cm3. \nThe model implementation was tested against experimental data obtained during \nthe cure of a composite. The experimental equipment used is shown in Fig.2. The \ndimensions of the mold cavity were 800 mm x 340 mm x 3 mm. The sides of the \ncavity were sealed using silicone rubber while the tool was closed using a glass plate \nand a set of stiffeners. Heating is achieved by an array of heating elements placed \nunder the mold cavity. The specific experimental configuration was selected in order \nto reduce the heat transfer problem to one dimension. This enables an easier \nimplementation of the inversion that follows to be made. The carbon fabric used had \na surface density of 816 g\/m2 and comprised three layers of unidirectional fiber tows \nat angles +45o,-45 o and 0o. Four layers of this fabric were used in the cavity to \nachieve a fiber weight fraction of 0.69. The total sequence of unidirectional tow plies \nwas [+45\/-45\/0\/0\/-45\/+45]2S. Resin filling was carried out at 120 oC. After \ncompletion of the filling, heating at 1.5 oC\/min was performed up to 160 oC, and then \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \nthe temperature was kept constant. Two thermocouples (k-type) which measure the \ntemperature at the top of the composite and at the mid-thickness were placed in the \ncenter of the curing component.  \nThe modeling domain considered comprised the composite and the glass top \nplate. The bottom of the composite was considered to follow the thermal profile \nmeasured by the tool temperature sensor. The rubber seal was assumed to act as an \ninsulator (zero heat flux) on the sides of the composite component. Natural air \nconvection was considered on the top and sides of the glass plate. The initial \ncondition was considered to be zero fractional conversion and uniform temperature \nafter the end of filling. The thermal properties of the glass plate are given in table 1. \n \n \nFIGURE 2 The resin transfer molding facility \n \n \n \n \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \nTable 1.

A comparison of the results of the three dimensional \ncase with the results of an one dimensional version of the model where only the \nthickness direction is considered showed that the 1-D model represents the curing of \nthe specific component adequately. The results of the one dimensional model are set \nagainst experimental results in Fig. 3.

The members of the population (individuals) \nare usually encoded in bit strings and the algorithm is iterated until some \nconvergence criteria are met. A code which performs these procedures and uses as a \ndirect model the one dimensional heat transfer simulation presented previously has \nbeen implemented. The operation of the algorithm is as follows.  \nA number (N) of initial values for each parameter corresponding to the first \ngeneration are created using a random number generator. Then the 1-D simulation is \nexecuted N times and the results corresponding to each individual are stored in a file. \nThe fitness of the individuals is calculated subsequently by comparing the output of \nthe direct model with a target, which drives the inversion. The form of the fitness \nfunction and the inversion target are specific to the application of the inversion \nprocedure.  \nThe next step of the algorithm is the encoding of the individuals. In this stage, \neach individual is translated into a unique binary string. The length of the string \ndefines the accuracy of the algorithm. Subsequently, the individuals are sorted \naccording to their fitness. A limited number (m) of individuals with the best fitness \nare passed directly into the new generation. The rest of the individuals of the new \ngeneration are produced with a combination of selection, crossover and mutation. \nThe selection is performed using a standard procedure called \u201croulette wheel\u201d. In this \nprocedure each individual is assigned a slice of a circular wheel, the size of the slice \nbeing proportional to the fitness of the individual. Two random numbers between 0 \nand 360 are generated and the individuals corresponding to them are selected. The \napplication of a uniform crossover operation to the two selected individuals follows. \nIn this operation a predefined probability (exchange probability) is compared with a \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \nrandom number between 0 and 1 at each bit of the binary string. If the number is \ngreater than the exchange probability the two selected individuals exchange their bit \nvalues, otherwise the values are preserved. At the end of this operation two new \nindividuals have been produced, each of them containing parts of the old individuals. \nSubsequently, a mutation operation is applied to the two new individuals. In this \nstage a very low probability (mutation probability) is compared with a random \nnumber for each bit of the two new strings. If the mutation probability is greater than \nthe random number, the bit of the string switches from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1, \notherwise it remains unchanged.  \nWhen N-m individuals have been produced, the selection-reproduction procedure \nstops. These N-m individuals together with the m best individuals of the previous \ngeneration form the new generation and the individuals are decoded back to decimal \nparameters.  \nAt that point the convergence of the algorithm is tested according to a criterion \nspecific to the application. If convergence has been reached, the algorithm outputs \nthe appropriate data and exits. Otherwise the execution of the direct heat transfer \nmodel for the new individuals is performed and the whole procedure of fitness \ncalculation, sorting, encoding, selection, reproduction and decoding is iterated until \nconvergence is achieved.    \n \nTHERMAL PROFILE OPTIMIZATION \n \nA straightforward application of the inversion procedure described previously is the \noptimization of the thermal profile applied during the cure. The thermal profile \ncomprises a linear heating up and an isothermal segment, thus can be characterized \nby two parameters:- (i) the ramp up rate and (ii) the isothermal temperature which \nare the subject of the optimization. The fitness function was selected so that it \nrewards the parameter values which reduce the duration of the curing stage, i.e. it \nincreases as the time to reach a fractional conversion of 0.84 in all elements of the \ncomponent decreases. This is implemented by the function:  \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \n ctFitness \/1=         (15) \nwhich is subject to the constraint: \n 6.0,\/5.2\nmax\n>< \u03b1formmC\ndz\ndT o      (16) \nThe meaning of the constraint is that for fractional conversions at which the \nmaterial has reached the rubbery state and residual stress can build up, the maximum \nthermal gradient must be kept lower than the thermal gradients achieved during \nconventional cure schedules. The implementation of the constraint is performed by \nexcluding from the selection and reproduction procedures all individuals which \nviolate it.  \nThe values of the optimization parameters are selected within practically \nmeaningful ranges, i.e. a heat up rate from 0 to 4 oC\/min and an isothermal \ntemperature from 150 to 190 oC. The algorithm is considered to have converged \nwhen the individuals of a generation have very small variation, i.e. the average \npercentage difference between the members of the population and the average is \nlower than 0.5 %.   \nThe algorithm was executed using three different sets of run parameters. The \nnumber of individuals, the length of the string and the average values of the initial \npopulation were altered in order to ensure solution independence of the genetic \nalgorithm features. The different sets of parameters are given in Table 2. In all cases \nthe three best individuals were directly passed to the next generation whilst the \nexchange probability was 40% and the mutation probability 2%. \n \nTable 2.

It can be observed that alteration of the parameters of \ngenetic algorithm does not affect the final result of the optimization. The optimal \nvalues found are a heating rate of 3 oC\/min and an isothermal temperature of 169 oC. \nGlobal optimality cannot be ensured, the effectiveness of the optimization can be \nevaluated by comparing the resulting cure completion time of 64.5 min with the cure \ncompletion time of the conventional thermal profile described previously which was \n87.5 min. A reduction in cure cycle time 26% is achieved, which could have a very \nsignificant impact on the total cost of production.  \n \n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n0 5 10 15 20\nGeneration\nC\nom\npl\net\nio\nn \ntim\ne \n(m\nin\n)\nCase 1\nCase 2\nCase 3\n \nFIGURE 4 Cure completion time vs generation number for the three runs of the \ngenetic algorithm \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \n158\n160\n162\n164\n166\n168\n170\n0 5 10 15 20\nGeneration\nIs\not\nhe\nrm\nal\n te\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (\no C\n)\nCase 1\nCase 2\nCase 3\n \nFIGURE 5 Isothermal temperature vs generation number for the three runs of the \ngenetic algorithm \n \n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n0 5 10 15 20\nGeneration\nHe\nat\nin\ng \nra\nte\n (\no C\n\/m\nin\n)\nCase 1\nCase 2\nCase 3\n \nFIGURE 6 Heating rate vs generation number for the three runs of the genetic \nalgorithm \nA comparison of the thermal profiles achieved with the optimized process \nparameters and the conventional cure profile is illustrated in Fig. 7.

Consequently, the \noptimized profile results in higher thermal gradients during heating up and the initial \nstages of the isothermal segment of the profile, whilst the thermal gradient falls \nbellow the limit of 2.5 oC \/mm when the material reaches the rubbery state at 36 min. \n \n120\n125\n130\n135\n140\n145\n150\n155\n160\n165\n170\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nTime (min)\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (\no C\n)\nConventional profile - 0 mm Optimized profile- 0 mm\nConventional profile - 1 mm Optimized profile- 1 mm\nConventional profile - 2 mm Optimized profile- 2 mm\nConventional profile - 3 mm Optimized profile - 3 mm\n \nFIGURE 7 Temperature vs time at different locations for the conventional and the \noptimized cure profile  \n \nMODELING-MONITORING INTEGRATION  \n \nThe second application of the inversion procedure examined here concerns the use of \non-line temperature measurement results in order to determine the dependence of the \ncomposite thermal conductivity on the fractional conversion and temperature. \nSubsequently, the distributions of the temperature and the degree of cure are \ncalculated.  \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \nThermal conductivity was identified as the critical parameter in the heat transfer \nsimulation as its measurement for a curing thermosetting material presents \nsignificant experimental difficulties whilst the sensitivity of the simulation results to \nits values is high. Fig. 8 illustrates the temperature evolution at mid-thickness of the \noriginal simulation and of the simulation when each of the properties involved is \nincreased by 5% throughout the cure.

The variable parameters \nare the coefficients of a polynomial, which expresses the dependence of the \ncomposite thermal conductivity on fractional conversion and temperature as follows: \n ( )543212 )( PPTPPPK +++= \u03b1\u03b1       (17) \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \n The fitness of an individual is calculated as follows: \n \u2211\n=\n\u2212\n= Q\ni\nM\nmid\ni TT\nFitness\n1\n1       (18)  \nwhere midiT is the calculated by the model temperature at time step i at the middle \nnode, Q  is the number of time steps and \niM\nT is the temperature measurement at time \nstep i. \nThe parameters of the finite element model have the values indicated by the \nconvergence study. In the genetic algorithm 26 individuals with a string length of \n100 bits were used. Five individuals were passed directly to the next generation, the \ncrossover and mutation probabilities were identical to those used in the thermal \nprofile optimization runs. The range of the five parameters to be estimated was \u20131 to \n1. \nThe convergence behavior of the algorithm is illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10. The \nalgorithm converges after about 30 generations. Note that the problem in that case \ninvolved five parameters and about 900 iterations of the direct model were required \nfor their estimation. A search method equivalent in terms of computational time \nwould have resulted in a accuracy of about 0.5 in the parameter estimation.

Their comparison with the results \nof the direct simulation, which was shown to be in agreement with the thermal \nmonitoring results utilized here for the inversion, is illustrated in Fig. 11. It can be \nobserved that the monitoring-modeling scheme predicts the global distribution of \ntemperature and degree of cure with satisfactory accuracy. The average error in \ntemperature estimation is 0.29 oC and in fractional conversion determination 0.0019. \nThe error in temperature is lower than the accuracy of the direct model whereas the \nerror in fractional conversion estimation is very low due to the fact that the higher \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \ndifferences in temperature between the inversion results and the direct model occur \nat low conversions when the reaction rate is very low. \n \n0\n1\n2\n3\n0 20 40\nGeneration\nAv\ner\nag\ne \n\u2206\n\u03a4\n (\no C\n)\n \nFIGURE 9 Difference between measurement and inverse modeling results vs \ngeneration  \n-0.5\n-0.2\n0.1\n0.4\n0 20 40Generation\nPa\nra\nm\nat\ner\ns\nP1 P2 P3 P4 P5\n \nFIGURE 10 Parameters of the thermal conductivity polynomial vs generation number \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \n130\n140\n150\n160\n0 30 60 90\nCure time (min)\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (\no C\n) 0 mm\n0.5 mm\n1 mm\n1.5 mm\n2 mm\n2.5 mm\n3 mm\nDirect model\n \nFIGURE 11 Temperature vs cure time at different levels as resulting from the \ninversion procedure and from the direct model  \n \nThe results of the sensitivity analysis indicated the high sensitivity of the \nmeasured temperature to the heat transfer coefficient.

Namely the original value of 8.5 \nW\/m2\/oC was altered to 8.3 and 8.7 W\/m2\/oC. The results are given in Table 3.

The monitoring-modeling \ncombined scheme offers the possibility to infer temperature and degree of cure \ndistributions from limited local thermal monitoring signals. Local monitoring results \ncombined with the inversion procedure result in a very accurate estimation of the \ntemperature and degree of cure evolutions during the cure. Both applications of heat \ntransfer inversion can be extended to the case of complex components where two or \nthree-dimensional modeling is required. Application of the monitoring-modeling \ncombined scheme may be limited due to computing time in the case of fast cures, \nhowever the majority of advanced composite components are subject to several \nhours long cure profiles. \n \n \n \n \n \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \nNOMENCLATURE \npc    Specific heat capacity \nh    Surface heat transfer coefficient \ntotH    Total heat of the curing reaction \nK    Thermal conductivity tensor \niN    Interpolation function \nn\u02c6    Surface vector \n'q    Boundary heat flux \nr\u02c6    Spatial coordinate \n1S    Temperature boundary \n2S    Heat flux boundary  \n3S    Convection boundary \nijS\n~    Interface \nT    Temperature \n'T    Boundary temperature \n\u221eT    Ambient temperature \nt    Time \nct    Time to complete the curing \nfv    Fiber volume fraction \n\u03b1    Degree of cure \nt\u2206    Time step \n\u03b8    Time discretization parameter \n\u03c1    Density of the composite \nr\u03c1    Resin density \n \n \n \nInverse Problems in Science and Engineering 12 (2004) 157-172 \nREFERENCES \n \n1.
