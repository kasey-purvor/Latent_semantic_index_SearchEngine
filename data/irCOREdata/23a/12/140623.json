Introduction 33 \nPreventative risk management has re-emerged as a central tenet of drinking water 34 \nprovision following the active promotion of the multibarrier approach (see Havelaar, 1994), 35 \npublication of the revised World Health Organisation (WHO) drinking water guidelines 36 \n(WHO, 2006) and various investigations of disease outbreaks (Hrudey and Hrudey, 2004; 37 \nSmeets et al. 2008).  Risk analysis tools may provide valuable support to process design 38 \nand optimisation (Pollard et al. 2004), but in isolation, and without being embedded an 39 \norganisational culture of risk management, are limited in their ability to prevent incidents 40 \n(Choudhrya et al. 2007).  The authors of this paper have a long standing research interest in 41 \nimplementing preventative risk management among water suppliers, and in the role that 42 \nrecent initiatives play in raising the profile of preventative risk management (AWWA et al. 43 \n2001).  Our studies have progressed beyond an inventory of risk analysis tools in the water 44 \nutility sector (MacGillivray et al. 2007a; 2007b), through an analysis of water quality 45 \nincidents (Hrudey and Hrudey, 2004) and the benchmarking of water supplier competencies 46 \n(MacGillivray and Pollard, 2008), to an exploration of the organisational relationships 47 \nwithin water suppliers, and between suppliers and health agencies (Pollard et al., 2009).  48 \nHuman actions and factors play an important role in water quality incidents (Pollard, 2008) 49 \n3 \nto an extent that we believe a formal analysis of human reliability would be beneficial in 50 \npreventing disease outbreaks.  Here, we present a secondary analysis of Hrudey and 51 \nHrudey\u2019s (2004) case studies in water disease outbreaks, and adopt Reason\u2019s (1990) \u2018Swiss 52 \ncheese\u2019 model of organisational incidents in re-categorising the causal factors that influence 53 \ndisease outbreaks.  Reason\u2019s model has wide application within the water sector and 54 \nobvious parallels with the multi-barrier approach that includes several layers of defence to 55 \nprevent water from contaminantion (Havelaar, 1994).  Such defences include source water 56 \nassessment and protection, the identification and correction of system defects, proper 57 \nmaintenance of the well and distribution system, the appropriate use of disinfection where 58 \nnecessary, and monitoring.  We are interested in how we might extend Reason\u2019s analogy to 59 \nimprove human reliability in water supply operations, with the assistance of HRA (Kirwan, 60 \n1996; Kirwan et al. 1997; Kirwan, 1997). 61 \nResearch attention in the reliability and maintenance community has conventionally 62 \nbeen centred on physical and software systems.  Industrial accidents were historically 63 \ncharacterised in terms of technological malfunctions, and the human element in the cause of 64 \nthe accident tended to be overlooked (Gordon, 1998).  A new subject, HRA, has attracted 65 \nresearchers\u2019 attention since the 1980s, especially since the post-mortem analyses of fatal 66 \naccidents often highlights the critical role played by human error.  It is suggested that the 67 \ncause of about 80% of all accidents can be attributed to human error (Whittingham, 2003).  68 \nThe term \u2018human reliability\u2019 is usually defined as the probability that a person will 69 \ncorrectly perform some system-required activity during a given time period, without 70 \nperforming any extraneous activity that might degrade the system.  HRA arose from the 71 \nneed to describe incorrect human actions in the context of probabilistic risk assessment 72 \n(PRA) or probabilistic safety analyses (PSA) Hollnagel, 2000). 73 \n4 \nAs with all risk analysis techniques, advocates and adversaries have emerged for HRA.  74 \nHowever, a number of sectors (e.g. nuclear, transport, offshore oil and gas) have 75 \nenthusiastically embraced HRA as one means of addressing their human factor and safety 76 \nproblems.  Alternatively, these sectors have been required to apply them through public or 77 \ngovernment pressure.  The nuclear industry was the first to develop and apply HRA 78 \n(Kirwan, 1994), in part driven by public and regulatory fears of nuclear accidents and by 79 \nthe risks incurred by investing operational responsibility in the hands of a single control 80 \nroom operator.  Other industries including aviation and aerospace, rail, air traffic control, 81 \nautomobile, offshore oil and gas, chemical, and all parts of the military have also applied 82 \nHRA (Kletz, 1994; Lyons, et al. 2004).  A comprehensive review of the distribution of the 83 \nHRA literature (1981-2003) is provided by Dhillon and Liu (2006), together with a 84 \ndistribution of applied research in various sectors (Figure 1).  Their analysis offers little 85 \ninformation on the application of HRA to drinking water safety.  How then might HRA 86 \nhelp the sector? 87 \n 88 \n<<Figure 1: Publication distribution of HRA by industrial sector (adapted from Dhillon and Liu, 89 \n2006)>> 90 \n 91 \nHrudey & Hrudey (2004) studies cases of disease outbreaks in 15 affluent nations over 92 \nthe past 30 years, which provides a detailed retrospective analysis of those water incidents. 93 \nBelow, we reappraise 62 cases of drinking water accidents (Hrudey and Hrudey, 2004), and 94 \nclassify human errors that directly or indirectly cause these accidents, analysing the 95 \ndevelopment process of accidents.  We argue that the Reason Swiss cheese model requires 96 \nmodification for drinking water safety, and we offer a revised model. 97 \n 98 \n5 \n2 Error and human reliability analysis 99 \nHRA applies relevant information about human characteristics and behaviour to the 100 \ndesign of objects, facilities, processes and environments that people use (Grandjean, 1980).  101 \nHRA techniques may be used retrospectively, in the analysis of incidents (though this 102 \noccurs infrequently), or prospectively to examine a system and its vulnerabilities during the 103 \ndesign phase.  Most approaches are grounded in a systemic approach, which sees the 104 \nhuman contribution in the context of the wider technical and organisational context 105 \n(Embrey, 2000).  The purpose of HRA is to examine any human-involved systems or 106 \nprocesses where weaknesses may lie or create a vulnerability to errors, rather than to find 107 \nfaults or apportion blame. 108 \n2.1 Error classification 109 \nError classification describes the types of errors that humans make.  A number of 110 \ntaxonomies exist (Meister, 1971; Swain and Guttman, 1983; Reason 1990).  The most 111 \ncommonly used system, proposed by Reason (1990), is to classify human errors into slips, 112 \nlapses, mistakes, and violations.  Two theoretical perspectives on human error in complex, 113 \nsociotechnical systems are the \u2018person\u2019 approach and the \u2018systems\u2019 perspective.  Person 114 \napproach (Reason, 2000) errors arise from aberrant mental processes such as forgetfulness, 115 \ninattention, poor motivation, carelessness, negligence, and recklessness.  Here, human error 116 \nis treated as the cause of most accidents, and the systems in which people work are 117 \nassumed to be safe.  The systems perspective (Reason, 2000) treats error as a systems rather 118 \nthan an individual\u2019s failure, and considers the combined role of latent conditions (e.g. 119 \ninadequate equipment, poor design, inadequate supervision, manufacturing defects, 120 \nmaintenance failures, inadequate training, clumsy automation, inappropriate or ill-defined 121 \nprocedures) and human errors (also known as active errors or failures) in accident causation 122 \n6 \nand propagation.  Human error is no longer treated as the primary cause of accidents; rather 123 \nas a consequence of latent conditions residing within the system. 124 \nReason (1990) describes four levels of human failure, each influencing the next 125 \n(Figure 2).  In his Swiss cheese model, Reason hypothesises that most accidents can be 126 \ntraced to one or more of four levels of failure: organizational influences, unsafe 127 \nsupervision, preconditions for unsafe acts, and the unsafe acts themselves.  An 128 \norganization's defences against failure are modelled as a series of barriers, represented as 129 \nthe slices of a Swiss cheese.  The \u2018holes\u2019 in the cheese slices represent individual 130 \nweaknesses in individual parts of the system, and are dynamically varying in size and 131 \nposition across all slices.  Unsafe acts can be seen as active failures, whereas the remaining 132 \nthree slices in Figure 2 are latent failures.  The main distinction between active and latent 133 \nfailures lies in: 134 \n\u2022 Active errors.  The consequences of active errors may become apparent within a 135 \nvery short time; such errors can be an omission or using the wrong rule.  They are 136 \nmost likely to be caused by front-line operators; 137 \n\u2022 Latent errors.  The consequences of latent errors may only become apparent after a 138 \nperiod of time, or when combined with other errors, or particular operational 139 \nconditions. 140 \n 141 \nFigure 2 The Swiss cheese model (redrawn from Reason 1990) 142 \n 143 \n 144 \nA brief description of each of the levels and their associated taxonomies is given below. 145 \n\u2022 Unsafe acts are largely due to operators.  These are caused by an operator\u2019s lack of 146 \nknowledge or poor choices; for example, in an incorrect response to an emergency, 147 \nor poor decision, etc; 148 \n7 \n\u2022 Preconditions for unsafe acts exist because of adverse mental states that affect 149 \nperformance; for example, loss of situational awareness, and inattention or 150 \ndistraction, or a failure to communicate or coordinate. 151 \n\u2022 Unsafe supervision occurs through inadequate guidance or oversight, or a failure to 152 \nprovide adequate training. 153 \n\u2022 Organisational influences such as process or managerial errors result from 154 \ninadequate or misinterpreted corporate decisions, for example, a failure to provide 155 \nadequate guidance or inadequate documentation, or the attitudes and behaviours of 156 \nemployees and contractors etc.  157 \n2.2 Error reduction and management 158 \nError management programmes use formal methods to develop a deeper understanding 159 \nof the nature of, and factors surrounding, error in a particular system.  The goal of error 160 \nmanagement is the eradication, reduction, management and mitigation of errors and their 161 \nconsequences.  Reason again (1997) cites a wide range of error management techniques, 162 \nincluding selection, training, licensing and certification and skill checks.  The techniques of 163 \nhuman error prediction are particularly useful.  A typical HRA modelling process includes 164 \nthree stages: (1) the identification of human errors, (2) the prediction of their likelihood, 165 \nand (3) the reduction of their likelihood, if required. 166 \nHRA techniques are commonly categorized into two generations.  The first-generation 167 \nwere developed for the probabilistic safety assessment of plant risk whereas the second 168 \ngeneration applied cognition analysis.  First generation tools include the tools THERP 169 \n(Swain and Guttmann, 1983), HEART (Williams, 1986), SLIM (Embrey, 1984), ASEP 170 \n(Swain 1987), TESEO (Bello and Colombari, 1980) and HCR (Hannaman, 1984).  The 171 \nsecond generation tools include ATHEANA (Cooper et.al. 1996), CREAM (Hollnagel, 172 \n8 \n1998), or MERMOS (Bieder, 1998).  By illustration, in the HEART methodology, the 173 \nfailure rate is estimated using an empirical expression of the form: 174 \n    \n( )\n( )\n\u03bb \u03bb= \u2212 +\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\uf8f4\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\uf8f4\n= \u2212 +\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\uf8f4\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\uf8f4\n=\n=\n\u220f\n\u220f\nb i i\nM\nb i i\nM\nEPC Ap\nHEP HEP EPC Ap\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n.\n.\n            (1) 175 \nwhere HEP is the human error probability, HEPb  is the nominal human error probability , \u03bb 176 \nis the overall human error rate , \u03bbb  is nominal human error rate, EPCi is the ith error 177 \npromoting condition and Api is a proportion assessment factor for the ith EPC.  Here, the 178 \nerror promoting condition can be unfamiliarity, time shortage, noisy or confused 179 \nsignals\/communications, poor man machine interface, misperception of risk, poor feedback, 180 \ninexperience, poor instructions, etc.  For example, a given task has the proposed nominal 181 \nhuman unreliability value of 0.002, and the factors shown in Table 1. 182 \nTable 1: Estimating human error probability. 183 \nThe final calculation for the human error probability can therefore be given by: 184 \n 185 \nHEP=0.002 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 3.4 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 1.25 \u00d7 1.4 = 0.04 186 \n 187 \n3 Applying HRA in the water utility sector 188 \nFrom a physical asset perspective, a drinking water distribution system is an 189 \ninterconnected collection of sources, pipes, and hydraulic control elements (pumps, valves, 190 \nregulators, and tanks), delivering safe drinking water to consumers in prescribed quantities 191 \nand at desired pressures.  It can be composed of water sources, raw water transmission 192 \npipes, unit water treatment processes combined together in treatment plants, and water 193 \n9 \ndistribution networks.  Unlike conventional HRA applications that involve smaller, highly 194 \ncontained systems (e.g. nuclear plants, aeroplanes), water distribution systems are widely 195 \ndistributed.  To illustrate application of Reason\u2019s model, we select 62 drinking water 196 \nincidents from Hrudey and Hrudey (2004) and categorise the human errors in these cases 197 \n(Table 7).  A distribution of the main errors is shown in Table 2 and Figure 3, suggesting 198 \nthat 38% of direct and\/or indirect causes can be due to active errors, 36% in the class of 199 \nlatent errors and 3% attributed to consumers and\/or regulators.  Table 3 lists some failures 200 \ndue to physical or environmental problems.  Our definitions are presented in Tables 4-6.  201 \nOne may argue that the errors in Table 4 can be classified as latent and attributable to 202 \nmultiple actors.  From Table 2, we note that among the 65 active errors, 16 are attributable 203 \nto a \u201cmistaken belief in the security of a water system\u201d, 11 are attributable to a failure \u201cto 204 \nrecognise warnings\u201d and 19 to a failure \u201cto take adequate measures on warning\u201d.  All of 205 \nthe three types of errors can traced to organisation structures. 206 \n 207 \nTable 2. Human error distribution in the 62 cases. 208 \n 209 \nFigure 3 Human error distribution. 210 \n 211 \nThe literature review indicates that, in comparison to other domains in which HRA has 212 \nbeen identified as a major problem, the construct has received relatively little attention 213 \nwithin the water sector.  This is surprising given the apparently significant role of human 214 \nerror reported by Hrudey and Hrudey (2004; Table 2).  Latent errors contribute 215 \nsignificantly to the human errors in the 62 cases (Table 2) suggesting organisational 216 \nreliability is a critical factor contributing to drinking water incidents. 217 \n10 \n3.1 The gestation of drinking water incidents  218 \nUnlike accidents in other industries, many drinking water incidents last for extended 219 \nperiods from the initial period of contamination to the restoration of safe drinking water 220 \nquality.  The immediate outbreaks in Milwaukee (case 38; Table 7) and in Walkerton (case 221 \n57; Table 7), lasted more than one month with subsequent consequences lasting for many 222 \nmonths and years thereafter.  Another example of the extended duration of drinking water 223 \nincidents is the accidental contamination of drinking water supplies in north Cornwall that 224 \noccurred in July 1988, the long term health impacts of which has been reviewed on a 225 \nnumber of occasions, most recently in 2005 (DoH, 2005).  Whilst there is no opportunity 226 \nfor recall once drinking water has been supplied, responsive action by water suppliers and 227 \nhealth agencies may still reduce impacts on consumers.  The gestation of a typical drinking 228 \nwater incident might be represented by Figure 4. 229 \n1) Contamination phase.  This period is the time starting from the occurrence of a 230 \ntriggering cause capable of contaminating the drinking water until the time that the 231 \ndrinking water is actually contaminated.  The contaminating period can be hard to 232 \nestimate exactly.  The cause can be due to extreme weather (e.g. the heavy rainfall in 233 \ncase 57), or unsafe maintenance work (e.g. a sewerage system maintenance exposing 234 \nwater distribution to risk in case 30), or wastes from infected wildlife (e.g. infected 235 \nbeavers in case 7).  Numerous human errors may occur in this period, such as 236 \nmaintenance errors (e.g. case 30), design errors (e.g. case 57), unsafe acts (e.g. case 237 \n16). 238 \n2) Sensing phase.  Abnormalities associated with the contaminated water can be sensed 239 \nby either consumers or quality monitoring systems.  Human errors that might occur 240 \ninclude: failure to perform routine monitoring (e.g. case 17, 57); design errors in the 241 \nmonitoring system (e.g. case 23); failure to interpret monitoring results correctly (e.g. 242 \ncase 59); failure to respond to consumer complaints (e.g. case 38).  243 \n3) Alarm phase.  This is the time between abnormalities being sensed and warning(s) 244 \nbeing signalled.  After consumers or monitoring systems have sensed any 245 \nabnormalities about water, alarms should be raised to engender a response.  A 246 \n11 \ncommon human error in this period is that no warning signals are raised or warnings 247 \nare inadequate. For example, infected consumers were not recognized to signal 248 \nwarnings (e.g. case 43) or did not signal warnings in a timely manner (e.g. case 59).  249 \n4) Recognition period.  Although warnings about abnormalities have been signalled, 250 \nthey have ignored or not been paid enough attention. Human errors in this period can 251 \nbe: failure to respond to warnings (e.g. cases 2, 13, 20, 22, 35, 37, 54, 57, 61), 252 \ninadequate response to warnings (e.g. cases 9, 10), etc.  It should be noticed that 253 \nraising warnings or issuing a boil water advisory might be a difficult measure for a 254 \nwater company to take on its own but such decisions should ideally be coordinated 255 \nwith public health authorities.  Frequent warnings or issuing boil water advisories can 256 \ndamage a company\u2019s reputation, but failure to provide warnings when they are 257 \nrequired will certainly attract liability. 258 \n5) Investigation and recovery phase.  The previous four phases might not all exist for 259 \naccidents occurring in other industries, for example, the crash of an aeroplane or the 260 \nexplosion of a chemical plant.  However, common to all accidents is the need for an 261 \ninvestigation and recovery period after an accident occurs.  In both literature and post-262 \nmortem analysis reports, no discussion on human error occurring in this period has 263 \nbeen found. However, an obvious human error that is likely to be all too common 264 \nwould be denial, leading to an inadequate investigation. 265 \n 266 \nIt should be noted that drinking water incidents do not necessarily go through all of the 267 \nabove periods. They may have only some of the periods as shown in Figure 4. 268 \n 269 \nFigure 4 A typical gestation for a drinking water incident. 270 \n3.2 A modified Swiss cheese model  271 \nThe Reason Swiss cheese model has two limitations restricting its application, 272 \nunmodified, to drinking water accidents.  Firstly, an accident is defined as a one-off event 273 \nlasting for a very short time, which is the case for aeroplane crashes, or explosions at 274 \nchemical plant.  However, drinking water incidents are seldom one-off events; they usually 275 \ndevelop with time and often last for several days.  The gestation (or lifecycle) of a typical 276 \n12 \ndrinking water incident is presented in Figure 4.  Secondly, the organisational boundary for 277 \ndrinking water incidents extends well beyond the corporate structure to include other 278 \nstakeholders.  From the 61 case studies, we notice that water consumers and regulators can 279 \nplay important roles in preventing more serious outcomes during these events.  Their 280 \ninvolvement can be to sense abnormalities, to report abnormalities, and to comply with 281 \nmeasures their drinking water supplier has taken: 282 \n\u2022 To sense abnormalities.  This is often the first critical step in drinking water 283 \nincidents.  For example, in case 34, a consumer had sensed a foul smell but didn\u2019t 284 \nreport the abnormality, this also happened in case 54. 285 \n\u2022 To report abnormalities.  Early warning signals are critical.  Since a drinking water 286 \nsystem is commonly a widely distributed system, it can be hard for the water 287 \nsupplier to sense every abnormality the whole time.  It is vitally important that 288 \nconsumers report any abnormalities about their drinking water and systems to their 289 \nsupplier.  Hrudey and Hrudey (2004) comment: 290 \nThe observation that the earliest signs of this outbreak were signalled by consumer 291 \ncomplaints about excess turbidity provides an important message to drinking water 292 \nproviders about the attention that should be paid to consumer complaints about 293 \nwater quality (page 177, Hrudey and Hrudey, 2004) 294 \nThis case study provides another example where consumers noticed the water was 295 \n\u201coff\u201d.  This observation might have provided an opportunity for earlier intervention 296 \nif the first mention of a consumer noticing something wrong had been reported and 297 \nacted upon (page 220, Hrudey and Hrudey, 2004).   298 \nFor example, in case 38, it is the drinking water supplier who failed to recognize 299 \nwarning signals from consumer complaints. 300 \n13 \nTo comply with measures their drinking water company has taken.  During disease 301 \noutbreaks compliance with boil water notices (advisories) can be vital to preventing 302 \npropagation of disease.  Notwithstanding observations that compliance is far from 303 \nuniversal and reduces with time (O'Donnell, Platt and Alston, 2000; Willcocks et al, 304 \n2000; Karagianmis, Schimmer and de Rouda Husman, 2008), effective 305 \ncollaboration with water consumers is critical (Hrudey and Hrudey, 2004): 306 \nThis finding raises concern about the level of understanding that may exist in a 307 \ncommunity during the boil water advisory and raises the need for an explanatory 308 \nliterature to be provided to any population at risk immediately after a boil water 309 \nadvisory is issued (page 287, Hrudey and Hrudey 2004). 310 \nEqually, regulators play an important role in preventing drinking water accidents.  For 311 \nexample, in case 7, one of the causes was that regulators failed to appreciate the 312 \nvulnerability of surface water, and in case 57, regulators failed to implement policy 313 \nrequiring continuous chlorine residual monitors on vulnerable shallow wells.  Viewing 314 \nTable 7, the main contributions of error involved the following: 315 \n\u2022 customers sensed abnormalities, but failed to report to their water supplier; 316 \n\u2022 customers sensed abnormalities, reported to their water suppliers, but the supplier 317 \nthen failed to respond to the reports; 318 \n\u2022 customer sensed abnormalities and reported to their water suppliers which 319 \nresponded to the reports, and accidents were successfully prevented.  These may 320 \nhave happened in many cases but have not been reported. 321 \nThe Swiss cheese model does not consider the role of third parties beyond the scope of 322 \nan individual company or organisation.  From this analysis however, it is suggested that 323 \nthird parties (regulators and the drinking water consumers), be considered in the HRA of 324 \ndrinking water incidents.  We therefore propose another \u2018slice\u2019 of cheese to represent the 325 \n14 \nconsumer and third parties (Figure 5).  It is conceptually presented with more holes, 326 \nsuggesting that this slice might arguably be the weakest barrier of a system.  However, a 327 \nforward-looking water utility can strengthen the protection offered by this slice by engaging 328 \ntheir public health agency in constructive dialogue and informing consumers about their 329 \nreasonable expectations for water quality and how they should respond when those 330 \nexpectations are not being met. 331 \nIt can be surmised that the systems perspective approach to human error has greater 332 \npotential in analysing the safety of a drinking water system than the person approach as the 333 \nformer considers not only the errors made by individual operators within the system, but 334 \nalso the role of various latent conditions that reside within the system.  From the above 335 \nanalysis, monitoring, assuring and improving the safety of drinking water systems requires 336 \nvarious levels of stakeholder participation and responsibilities.  In their analysis of two 337 \nwater incidents (Case 47 and Case 59 in Table 7), Woo and Vicente (2003a) conclude that 338 \neffective risk management should consider various actors at each level including 339 \ngovernment, regulators\/associations, company, management, staff and work.  These levels 340 \nconstitute a complex sociotechnical system of risk management (Rasmussen, 1997). 341 \nResearch on the impact on drinking water safety can also be found in Vicente and 342 \nChristoffersen (2006), Hrudey and Hrudey (2003), Woo and Vicente (2003b), and Vicente 343 \nand Christoffersen (2006). 344 \nThe Swiss cheese model can be developed along with a consideration of approaches 345 \nused in risk management for dynamic sociotechnical systems.  The Swiss cheese model 346 \ndoes not mention that the number of holes and the locations and sizes of holes in a slice can 347 \ndynamically change but this is self evident.  The dynamic forces that lead to accidents have 348 \noften been in place for some time, yet the feedback to reveal the safety implications of these 349 \n15 \nforces is often largely unavailable to the actors observing these systems (Vicente and 350 \nChristoffersen, 2006) 351 \n 352 \nFigure 5 A Swiss cheese model for drinking water safety. 353 \n 354 \n4 Concluding remarks 355 \nMajor accidents are almost always the result of multiple errors, or combinations of 356 \nsingle errors with pre-existing vulnerable conditions (Wagenaar et al., 1990).   Incidents in 357 \nthe water sector are combinations of many errors.  Not all HRA techniques are suitable for 358 \napplication in the water utility sector.  However, drinking water incidents can be caused by 359 \na lack of sufficient vigilance regarding warning signals (that might lead to such incidents), 360 \npoor system design, poor installation; and poor maintenance.  All of these can be regarded 361 \nas involving human error to a certain degree.  Most of the current HRA approaches have 362 \nbeen developed for a single organisation, but safe drinking water is widely understood as a 363 \ncollective responsibility (IWA, 2004).  Therefore, the Swiss cheese model requires 364 \namendment for the context of drinking water systems.  Here we have offered a proof of 365 \nconcept for the application of HRA to water quality incidents, have defined the gestation 366 \nand lifecycle of drinking water incidents and investigated human errors in each period of 367 \nthe lifecycle, extending the Swiss cheese model that aptly depicts barriers existing in 368 \ndrinking water safety.  Through a re-analysis of case studies, we have reconfirmed the long 369 \ndelay time of drinking water incidents and reported the active role of latent errors, and third 370 \nparties.  Critically, we reassert the necessity of proactive, preventative risk management in 371 \nidentifying and remedying latent conditions.  Pertinent areas for future research include: 372 \n\u2022 The development of human error databases.  Research into how to collect and 373 \nanalyse human error data and the application of error management approaches 374 \nwithin water utilities is required. 375 \n16 \n\u2022 Investigation of the lifecycle of drinking water accidents.  Understanding the 376 \ndistribution of human errors across the lifecycle of drinking water incidents might 377 \nhelp reduce errors and allow targeted action 378 \n\u2022 Development of human error management tools.  We suggest error management, 379 \nwarning handling and error prediction tools are required for the drinking water 380 \nsector.  An on-line tool may be useful for this purpose. 381 \n\u2022 Development of effective warning systems.  For the new slice in Figure 5, 382 \nemergency population warning (EPW) systems, for example, have been used for 383 \ntornadoes, hurricanes, and ice storms; geological incidents such as earthquakes, 384 \nlandslides, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis.  It is a method whereby local, 385 \nregional, or national authorities can contact members of the public en masse to 386 \nwarn them of an impending emergency.  Might such a method help contain 387 \ndrinking water outbreaks? 388 \n\u2022 Addressing overconfidence arising from the infrequent occurrence of drinking water 389 \noutbreaks in developed countries making the maintenance of informed vigilance 390 \na management challenge. 391 \nIn pursuing this agenda, we now seek to exemplify this proof of concept with the detailed 392 \npractical application of HRA concepts to water quality incidents.  In doing so, we seek 393 \nbuild a database of active, latent and third party errors,  model sub-systems and build 394 \nincident prediction models. 395 \n 396 \nAcknowledgements 397 \nThis research was supported by an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council 398 \nrisk and regulation sandpit grant (EP\/E017800\/1). 399 \n 400 \n17 \nReferences 401 \nAWWA, EUREAU, WSAA, DVGW.
