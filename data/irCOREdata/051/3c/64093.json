The survey has been repeated at five-27 \nyearly intervals and in this paper we report on the temporal trends in the concentration 28 \nof cadmium, lead and mercury between 1990 and 2000. Metal- and country-specific 29 \ntemporal trends were observed. In general, the concentration of lead and cadmium in 30 \nmosses decreased between 1990 and 2000; the decline was higher for lead than 31 \ncadmium. For mercury not enough data were available to establish temporal trends 32 \nbetween 1990 and 1995, but between 1995 and 2000 the mercury concentration in 33 \nmosses did not change across Europe. The observed temporal trends for the 34 \nconcentrations in mosses were similar to the trends reported for the modelled total 35 \ndeposition of cadmium, lead and mercury in Europe. 36 \n 37 \nKeywords: biomonitoring, EMEP maps, heavy metals, metal deposition, moss survey 38 \n 39 \nCapsule: Across Europe cadmium and lead concentrations in mosses declined but 40 \nmercury concentrations did not change between 1990 and 2000. 41 \n 42 \n1. Introduction 43 \n 44 \nThe heavy metals in mosses survey was originally established in 1980 as a joint 45 \nDanish-Swedish initiative. The idea of using mosses to measure atmospheric heavy 46 \nmetal deposition was developed in the late 1960s by R\u00fchling and Tyler (1968). It is 47 \nbased on the fact that mosses, especially the carpet-forming species, obtain most of their 48 \n 3 \nnutrients directly from precipitation and dry deposition; there is little uptake of metals 49 \nfrom the substrate. The technique of moss analysis provides a surrogate, time-integrated 50 \nmeasure of the spatial patterns of heavy metal deposition from the atmosphere to 51 \nterrestrial systems. It is easier and cheaper than conventional precipitation analysis as it 52 \navoids the need for deploying large numbers of precipitation collectors with an 53 \nassociated long-term programme of routine sample collection and analysis. Therefore, a 54 \nmuch higher sampling density can be achieved than with conventional precipitation 55 \nanalysis. The higher trace element concentrations in mosses compared to rain water 56 \nmakes analysis more straightforward and less prone to contamination. Although the 57 \nheavy metal concentration in mosses provides no direct quantitative measurement of 58 \ndeposition, this information can be derived by using regression approaches relating the 59 \nresults from moss surveys to precipitation monitoring data (e.g. Berg and Steinnes, 60 \n1997; Berg et al., 2003). 61 \nThe moss survey has been repeated at five-yearly intervals and the number of 62 \nparticipating European countries has expanded greatly since 1990 (Buse et al., 2003; 63 \nR\u00fchling, 1994; R\u00fchling and Steinnes, 1998). Currently, the 2005\/2006 moss survey is 64 \nbeing conducted in 32 countries, analysing moss samples from over 7 000 sites across 65 \nEurope. For the first time the majority of countries (18) will also determine the nitrogen 66 \nconcentration in mosses (ca. 3 200 sites). A pilot study for selected Scandinavian 67 \ncountries has shown that there was a good linear relationship between the total nitrogen 68 \nconcentration in mosses and atmospheric nitrogen deposition rates (Harmens et al., 69 \n2005). During 2001, responsibility for the coordination of the moss survey was handed 70 \nover from the Nordic Working Group on Monitoring and Data, Nordic Council of 71 \nMinisters, to the UNECE ICP Vegetation (United Nations Economic Commission for 72 \nEurope International Cooperative Programme on Effects of Air Pollution on Natural 73 \n 4 \nVegetation and Crops) Coordination Centre at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology 74 \n(CEH) Bangor, UK. 75 \nThe UNECE ICP Vegetation was established in the late 1980s to consider the 76 \nscience for quantifying damage to plants by air pollutants. It is one of seven ICPs and 77 \nTask Forces that report to the Working Group on Effects of the Long-Range 78 \nTransboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) Convention on the effects of atmospheric 79 \npollutants on different components of the environment (e.g. forests, fresh waters, 80 \nbuildings) and human health (Working Group on Effects, 2004). The objectives of the 81 \nICP Vegetation (Harmens et al., 2006) are designed to meet the requirements of the 82 \nLRTAP Convention, particularly at present the need to provide information for the 83 \nreview of the 1999 Gothenburg Protocol to abate acidification, eutrophication, ground-84 \nlevel ozone, and the 1998 Aarhus Protocol on heavy metals. The latter was the first 85 \nProtocol for the control of emissions of heavy metals; cadmium, lead and mercury 86 \nemissions were targeted as they are the most toxic. 87 \nThe European moss survey provides data on concentrations of ten heavy metals 88 \n(As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) in naturally growing mosses (Buse et al., 2003; 89 \nR\u00fchling, 1994; R\u00fchling and Steinnes, 1998). The main purpose of the survey is a) to 90 \nprovide, in the form of maps, spatial information on the distribution of heavy metal 91 \nconcentrations in mosses in Europe, b) identify main polluted areas, and c) develop the 92 \nunderstanding of long-range transboundary pollution. In general, there was a clear 93 \neast\/west decrease in the concentration of heavy metals in mosses, related in particular 94 \nto industry. Former industrial or historic sites of heavy metal pollution (e.g. mines) 95 \naccounted for the location of some high concentrations of heavy metals in mosses in 96 \nareas without contemporary industries. Long-range transboundary transport appears to 97 \naccount for elevated concentrations of heavy metals in areas without emission sources 98 \n 5 \n(e.g. in Scandinavia). Many contributors to the survey have reported their national data 99 \nin greater detail elsewhere.  100 \n In this paper, we report on the temporal trends (1990 \u2013 2000) of heavy metal 101 \nconcentrations in mosses for the heavy metals targeted by the Aarhus Protocol, i.e. 102 \ncadmium, lead and mercury. As the emissions of these heavy metals have declined 103 \nacross Europe in recent decades (Ilyin et al., 2005), we hypothesize that the 104 \nconcentrations of these metals in mosses have declined too. In particular we expected a 105 \nmarked decline in the lead concentrations in mosses due to the introduction of unleaded 106 \npetrol. The reduction in mercury concentrations is likely to be lower due to the lower 107 \nreduction in emissions and hemispheric transport of mercury across the globe. The 108 \ntrends in the metal concentrations in mosses were compared with those reported by 109 \nEMEP (Co-operative programme for monitoring and evaluation of the long-range 110 \ntransmission of air pollutants in Europe) regarding the modelled deposition of these 111 \nmetals across Europe (Ilyin et al., 2005). In a following paper we will report on the 112 \ntemporal trends of the other heavy metals. 113 \n 114 \n2. Materials and methods 115 \n 116 \nMoss samples were collected across Europe in 1990\/1991 (R\u00fchling, 1994), 117 \n1995\/1996 (R\u00fchling and Steinnes, 1998) and 2000\/2001 (Buse et al., 2003; Harmens et 118 \nal., 2004). Throughout the paper we refer to the years of moss survey as 1990, 1995 and 119 \n2000 respectively. The carpet-forming mosses Pleurozium schreberi and Hylocomium 120 \nsplendens were the preferred species for analysis. Where necessary, other species were 121 \ncollected, Hypnum cupressiforme being the next choice. Because the mosses were 122 \ncollected in a range of habitats from the sub-arctic climate of northern Sweden to the 123 \n 6 \nhot and dry climate of parts of southern Italy, it was inevitable that a wide range of 124 \nmoss species were sampled (Buse et al., 2003; Harmens et al., 2004). The moss 125 \nsampling procedure was according to the guidelines described in R\u00fchling (1994) and 126 \nR\u00fchling and Steinnes (1998) and was described in more detail in the protocol for the 127 \n2000 survey (ICP Vegetation, 2001). Only the last three years\u2019 growth of moss material 128 \nwas used for the analyses. The concentration of cadmium, lead and mercury were 129 \ndetermined by a range of analytical techniques, under the broad headings of atomic 130 \nabsorption spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (both ICP optical 131 \nemission spectrometry and ICP mass spectrometry), atomic fluorescence spectrometry, 132 \nand neutron activation analysis. All metal concentrations were expressed as mg kg-1 dry 133 \nweight at 40 oC. For details on the methods and quality control procedures we refer to 134 \nthe reports of the individual surveys (Buse et al., 2003; R\u00fchling, 1994; R\u00fchling and 135 \nSteinnes, 1998). EMEP maps were produced according to the method described by 136 \nBuse et al. (2003); they show the mean concentration of each metal within individual 137 \nEMEP grid squares (50 km x 50 km). Please note that the designations employed and 138 \nthe presentation of material in this paper do not imply the expression of any opinion 139 \nwhatsoever on the part of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country, 140 \nterritory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers 141 \nor boundaries. 142 \nStatistical analysis of the temporal trends (1990 \u2013 2000) across Europe was 143 \nperformed by calculating the geometric mean values per metal per survey year for each 144 \ncountry. Subsequently, a general linear model ANOVA (Minitab version 14) was 145 \napplied to each metal using only the geometric mean values for the countries which had 146 \ndetermined the heavy metal concentration in mosses in all survey years for that metal. 147 \nThe geometric mean values were analysed with country as a factor, year as covariate 148 \n 7 \nand the number of samples as weights. Weighting was applied to take into account the 149 \naccuracy of the calculated geometric means (i.e. the density of sampling varied between 150 \ncountries; see Buse et al., 2003) and to give more weight to larger countries and less to 151 \nsmaller ones. For mercury changes with time were determined for the period 1995 \u2013 152 \n2000 as only two countries had determined the mercury concentration in mosses in 153 \n1990.  154 \n 155 \n3. Results 156 \n 157 \nIn tables 1 - 3 we only included the data for countries that determined heavy 158 \nmetal concentrations in mosses in at least two of the three surveys. In general, the 159 \ncadmium and lead concentrations in mosses decreased between 1990 and 2000 (Tables 160 \n1 and 2; Figs. 1 and 2) and in the majority of countries the mercury concentration in 161 \nmosses decreased between 1995 and 2000 (Table 3; Fig. 3). The average median value 162 \nfor countries that had determined cadmium and lead concentrations in mosses in both 163 \n1990 and 2000, decreased by 42% and 57% for cadmium and lead respectively (Table 164 \n4). Analysis of the geometric mean values confirmed that the decline in cadmium and 165 \nlead concentration in mosses with time was significant (Table 5). However, it should be 166 \nnoted that country-specific trends were found (Tables 1 - 3). In some countries, 167 \ncadmium and\/or lead concentrations did not change or increase between 1990 and 1995, 168 \nwhereas in others they did not change or increase between 1995 and 2000. However, 169 \nonly in Portugal the cadmium concentration was higher in 2000 than 1990 and only in 170 \nLithuania and the Russian Federation (region of St. Petersburg) the lead concentration 171 \nwas higher in 2000 than 1990. This appears to be primarily due to the relatively low 172 \nconcentration of cadmium and lead found in the mosses in the 1990 survey in those 173 \n 8 \ncountries, possibly due to analytical error. The extremely high cadmium concentration 174 \nin mosses in the Netherlands in 1995 (and to a lesser extent in 1990) also suggests an 175 \nanalytical error. The mercury concentration in mosses did not change in Austria and 176 \nItaly and even increased in France, Lithuania, and Slovakia between 1995 and 2000. 177 \nThe sharp decline in the mercury concentration in mosses in Sweden is exceptional 178 \ncompared with the trends observed in neighbouring countries and the rest of Europe. 179 \nThe average median value for countries that determined mercury concentrations in 180 \nmosses in both 1995 and 2000 decreased by 8%. Analysis of the geometric mean values 181 \nshows that this decline with time was not significant (Table 5). 182 \nSimilar trends were reported by EMEP Meteorological Synthesizing Centre - 183 \nEast (EMEP\/MSC-E) regarding the modelled total heavy metal deposition in Europe 184 \n(Ilyin et al., 2005). Between 1990 and 2000 the total deposition of cadmium and lead 185 \nwas reduced by 45% and 52% respectively, whereas the total deposition of mercury was 186 \nreduced by 8% between 1995 and 2000 (Table 4). As in the moss survey, country-187 \nspecific temporal trends were observed in the modelled total heavy metal deposition.  188 \n 189 \n4. Discussion 190 \n 191 \nThe cadmium and lead concentration in mosses decreased significantly across 192 \nEurope between 1990 and 2000, with the decline being higher for lead than cadmium. 193 \nIn contrast, no significant change was observed for the mercury concentration in mosses 194 \nbetween 1995 and 2000. However, it should be noted that country-specific trends were 195 \nobserved. These findings are in agreement with the temporal trends reported by EMEP 196 \nregarding the modelled total deposition of these metals in Europe (Ilyin et al., 2005). 197 \nThe modelled concentrations of cadmium, lead and mercury in air and precipitation 198 \n 9 \nwere generally in good agreement with available measurement data in the EMEP 199 \nmonitoring network (Ilyin and Travnikov, 2005).  200 \nGasoline lead additives have been the key emission source of lead over the last 201 \ndecades. Phasing out leaded petrol across Europe has resulted in about 8 and 6 times 202 \nreduction in lead emissions and depositions respectively between 1980 and 2000 (Ilyin 203 \net al., 2004). The highest reduction of emissions and depositions occurred between 1985 204 \nand 1990. Whereas in 1990 the sector \u2018road transportation\u2019 was the major source of lead 205 \nemission (85%), in 2003 the sector \u2018metal production\u2019 was the major source with a 206 \ncontribution to lead emission of 28% (Verstreng et al., 2005). The increase in lead 207 \nconcentration in mosses in countries such as the Russian Federation and the Ukraine is 208 \nlikely due to the fact that these countries still used leaded petrol long after it had been 209 \nphased out elsewhere in Europe, together with an immense rise in the number of cars in 210 \nthese countries.  211 \nAtmospheric cadmium may originate from multiple sources. Of key significance 212 \nare various combustion processes based on fossil fuels (in particular coal and oil), as 213 \nwell as various processes in the pyrometallurgical non-ferrous metal industries and 214 \nwaste incineration. Whereas in 1990 the sector \u2018waste incineration\u2019 was the major 215 \nsource of cadmium emission (20%), in 2003 the sector \u2018metal production\u2019 was the 216 \nmajor source (26%) (Verstreng et al., 2005). Cadmium emissions and depositions in 217 \nEurope decreased about 4 and 3 times respectively between 1980 and 2000 and as for 218 \nlead the highest decline was observed between 1985 and 1990 (Ilyin et al., 2004).  219 \nThe most important anthropogenic sources of mercury are the combustion of 220 \nfuels (in particular coal), waste incineration and chlor-alkali and cement production. In 221 \n1990 the maximum contribution to the total mercury emissions was from the sector 222 \n\u2018public electricity and heat production\u2019 (29%), but in 2003 the sector \u2018other, 223 \n 10 \nmanufacturing industries and construction\u2019 became the largest source of emissions 224 \n(31%) (Verstreng et al., 2005). Anthropogenic mercury emissions and depositions in 225 \nEurope decreased about 2 and 1.5 times respectively between 1990 and 2000, with the 226 \ndecline being higher in the early than late 1990s (Ilyin et al., 2004). In contrast to 227 \ncadmium and lead, mercury is a global pollutant, i.e. it can be transported by 228 \natmospheric flows around the world. Therefore, mercury emission sources located in 229 \nother continents significantly affect mercury pollution levels in Europe. In addition, 230 \nnatural emission sources and re-emission contribute significantly to mercury levels in 231 \nthe atmosphere (Ilyin et al., 2004). 232 \nThe similarity in temporal trends reported for the data of the European moss 233 \nsurvey and the modelled total depositions suggests that at the European scale these 234 \ntrends are not affected by potential confounding factors. For example, high uncertainties 235 \nare associated with the available official estimates of anthropogenic emissions, which 236 \nform the basis of the EMEP modelled deposition data. The official emission data cannot 237 \nexplain measured wet deposition levels of cadmium and lead in Europe (Ilyin and 238 \nTravnikov, 2005). Based on the measurement data in the EMEP monitoring network, 239 \nthe official emission data for cadmium and lead are expected to underestimate emissions 240 \nby a factor 2 to 3. In the current study, the temporal trends of the lead and cadmium 241 \nconcentrations in mosses were therefore compared with EMEP modelled total 242 \ndeposition data based on adjusted emission scenarios (Ilyin and Travnikov, 2005; Ilyin 243 \net al., 2005).  244 \nSeveral studies have indicated that the use of mosses as biomonitors of 245 \natmospheric heavy metal deposition could be confounded by various climatic, 246 \ngeographical and environmental factors (e.g. Berg and Steinnes, 1997; Zechmeister et 247 \nal., 2003). Confounding factors in relating the heavy metal concentrations in mosses to 248 \n 11 \nmeasured wet deposition rates across Europe include the distance of the sampling site to 249 \nthe sea and the significantly higher dry deposition in Central Europe, which in many 250 \ncases affected the concentration in mosses more than the wet deposition (Berg et al., 251 \n2003). The drier climate in Mediterranean areas at low altitude is likely to reduce moss 252 \ngrowth rates (e.g. Vitt, 1990) in comparison with the wetter climates in northern 253 \nEuropean countries or higher altitudes. Variation in moss growth rates due to variation 254 \nin (micro)climate might influence the heavy metal concentration in mosses (e.g. Gerdol 255 \net al., 2002; Zechmeister, 1998), in particular for extracellular bound elements (Gerdol 256 \net al., 2002). Conflicting results have been reported regarding seasonal variations in the 257 \nheavy metal concentrations in mosses (Berg and Steinnes, 1997; Th\u00f6ni, 1996; 258 \nZechmeister et al., 2003) and the variation of heavy metal concentrations in mosses with 259 \naltitude (Gerdol et al., 2002; Zechmeister, 1995). How these potential confounding 260 \nfactors together exactly affect both the spatial and temporal variation of the 261 \nconcentration of various heavy metals in mosses at the European scale requires further 262 \ninvestigation. One should bear in mind that the metal concentrations in mosses are 263 \ndetermined over a three-year growth period, representing climatic conditions averaged 264 \nover three years. A preliminary analysis by B\u00fcker et al. (2003) showed that the variation 265 \nin the concentration of heavy metals in mosses in the 2000\/2001 moss survey could 266 \nhardly be explained by variation in climatic and geographical factors. In addition, 267 \ndespite the broad variation in climate between northern and southern Europe, results of 268 \nthe European moss surveys do not indicate a clear north \u2013 south gradient in the heavy 269 \nmetal concentration in mosses in contrast to a clear east \u2013 west gradient related to 270 \nsources of heavy metal pollution (Buse et al., 2003).  271 \nAnother potential confounding factor regarding temporal trends could be that 272 \noften participants have not consistently sampled mosses from the same sites in every 273 \n 12 \nsurvey and sometimes have sampled different moss species in different years. It is 274 \nknown that different moss species accumulate heavy metals at different rates and that 275 \nthe difference in accumulation rates are metal-specific (e.g. Ashmore et al., 2000; Berg 276 \nand Steinnes, 1997; Galsomi\u00e8s et al., 1999; Th\u00f6ni, 1996). However, statistical analyses 277 \nand the use of artificial neural networks indicate that the variation in heavy metal 278 \nconcentrations in mosses in the 2000 European survey can hardly be explained by the 279 \nuse of different moss species (B\u00fcker et al., 2003). Reimann et al. (2001) concluded that 280 \nfor regional mapping purposes the moss species H. splendens and P. schreberi can be 281 \ncombined without interspecies calibration, as for the majority of heavy metals the 282 \nwithin-catchment variation is large for both moss species. Th\u00f6ni (1996) came to a 283 \nsimilar conclusion for the moss species H. splendens, P. schreberi and H. 284 \ncupressiforme.  285 \nThe use of different analytical techniques could be another source of variation in 286 \nthe heavy metal concentration in mosses, but intercalibrations between the laboratories 287 \nin the 1995 survey showed that there is a reasonable agreement between all analytical 288 \ntechniques used (Steinnes et al., 1997). However, instrumental neutron activation 289 \nanalysis (INAA) showed higher concentrations in some cases due to the fact that the 290 \nmethod determines the total concentration of elements, while other methods need wet 291 \ndigestion of samples with nitric acid, i.e. silicate minerals in the mosses are only partly 292 \ndecomposed (Schaug et al., 1990). B\u00fcker et al. (2003) showed that the variation in 293 \nheavy metal concentrations in the 2000 moss survey cannot be explained by the use of 294 \ndifferent analytical techniques.  295 \nAlthough calibration factors have been developed in for example the Nordic 296 \ncountries to convert heavy metal concentrations in mosses to bulk wet deposition values 297 \nfor certain heavy metals (Berg and Steinnes, 1997; Berg et al., 2003), these models 298 \n 13 \nshould only be used for background sites. A good linear relationship (correlation 299 \ncoefficient R = 0.91) was found between lead concentrations in mosses and modelled 300 \ntotal lead deposition rates for selected grid cells in Scandinavia where EMEP 301 \nmonitoring stations are situated, i.e. at locations influenced by long-range transboundary 302 \nair pollution only. The correlation coefficient was much lower (R = 0.56) when this 303 \nrelationship was determined for the whole of Europe, which is due to the fact that lead 304 \nconcentrations in mosses were also determined in areas of Europe affected by local 305 \npollution sources (Ilyin and Travnikov, 2005). The country-specific relationships 306 \nbetween the heavy metal concentrations in mosses and the modelled atmospheric 307 \ndeposition rates require further investigation to establish in more detail any confounding 308 \nfactors affecting these relationships. In light of the high uncertainties currently 309 \nassociated with the EMEP modelled heavy metal deposition data, the data of the heavy 310 \nmetals in mosses biomonitoring network remain an invaluable resource for i) 311 \ndetermining both general and more detailed spatial and temporal trends in heavy metal 312 \ndeposition in Europe and ii) verifying the performance of the EMEP heavy metal 313 \ndeposition model, at least in areas influenced by long-range transboundary air pollution 314 \nonly. Whereas the European moss survey provides data on ten heavy metals, detailed 315 \napplication of the EMEP heavy metal deposition model has been limited so far to the 316 \nheavy metals cadmium, lead and mercury, although pilot calculations of atmospheric 317 \ntransport and depositions of other metals have been conducted recently (Ilyin et al., 318 \n2006).  319 \n 320 \n5. Conclusions 321 \n 322 \n 14 \nMosses provide a cheap and effective method for monitoring temporal trends in 323 \nheavy metal pollution in Europe. Temporal trends in the concentrations of cadmium, 324 \nlead and mercury in mosses were in agreement with those reported for modelled total 325 \ndeposition of these metals in Europe. Significant reductions in the emissions of 326 \ncadmium and lead between 1990 and 2000 have resulted in a significant reduction of the 327 \naccumulation of both metals in mosses. The smaller reductions in emissions of mercury 328 \nover the shorter time period (1995 \u2013 2000) studied here meant that no significant 329 \nchanges were found in the accumulation of mercury in mosses between 1995 and 2000. 330 \n 331 \nAcknowledgements 332 \n 333 \nWe thank the United Kingdom Department for Environment, Food and Rural 334 \nAffairs (Defra) for funding the ICP Vegetation Coordination Centre (contracts EPG 335 \n1\/3\/170, 1\/3\/205 and AQ03509).
