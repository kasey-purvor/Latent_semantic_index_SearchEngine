This\nis likely to increase substantially as some \u00a3100 million has been made available to stimulate\nsoftware development in the UK through various initiatives, such as the EEC COMETT\nprogram and the UK Higher Education Funding Councils' Teaching and Learning Technology\nProgramme (TLTP).\nCBL has a number of perceived advantages to both staff and students: it can promote active,\nrather than passive, learning; it can give students control over when and where they learn and\nthe pace of their learning; it may promote better understanding by using features which both\nenhance the clarity and quality of presentation of material and stimulate student interaction; it\n37\nS. Brain et al Evaluation of a computer-based learning program to support student learning in pharmacology\ncan potentially save staff time and resources. It especially lends itself to the teaching of\nmedicine, which as Waterfield and Furber (1992) emphasize is a highly visual subject.\nAt King's College, London, CBL is increasingly used as a teaching and learning tool in the\nundergraduate medical curriculum. This is in response to the perceived need that medical\ngraduates need to be both familiar with and have a threshold competence in information\ntechnology and computing skills (Clack, 1994; GMC, 1993). Furthermore, there is now an\nabundance of CBL resources available for supporting teaching and learning in the medical\nsciences, particularly material produced by TLTP projects in medicine-related subjects.\nIn the biom\u00e9dical sciences a number of studies have assessed the effectiveness of different\nforms of CBL. This includes studies on computer-based simulations of laboratory practic\u00e1is\n(Clarke, 1987; Brown et al, 1988; Modell, 1989, 1992a; Fawver et al, 1990; Guy and Frisby,\n1992; Coleman et al, 1994; Dewhurst et al, 1994; Leathard and Dewhurst, 1995; McAteer et\nal, 1996) and computer-based tutorials (Anderson-Harper et al, 1988; Fincher et al, 1988;\nFeldman et al, 1989; Garrett et al, 1990; Hollingsworth and Foster, 1991; McCurrie and\nHuckbody, 1992; Modell, 1992b; Hutchins et al, 1995; Inglis et al., 1995; Gunn and Maxwell\n1996). In the main, such studies conclude that CBL is at least as effective (in terms of\nknowledge acquisition or meeting assessment criteria) as traditional methods of teaching,\nalthough its use may result in different learning objectives being achieved - for example,\ncomputer simulations of laboratory-based experiments cannot teach practical laboratory\nskills.\nMany teachers are unwilling to use CBL packages, particularly those which are developed by\nothers outside their own university department, and studies which evaluate their use may be\nhelpful in breaking down barriers to new methods of teaching and learning. Here we describe a\nstudy that assesses the effectiveness of a CBL program on inflammation in supporting the\nteaching of undergraduate medical students.\nThe computer program\nThe CBL program used in the study was developed by the authors as part of a TLTP project\n(Pharma-CAL-ogy). It is intended as an introductory learning package on the pharmacology\nand pathophysiology of inflammation, and is aimed primarily at undergraduate students of\npharmacology, medicine, dentistry and biological sciences.\nThe anticipated learning outcomes are that, on completion of the package, students should be\nable to:\n\u2022 describe the timescale and the cardinal signs of the inflammatory response to tissue injury;\n\u2022 list the various chemical mediators involved and describe and explain their local and\nsystemic effects;\n\u2022 explain the molecular mechanisms of cell accumulation;\n\u2022 describe the major processes involved in tissue repair;\n\u2022 describe and explain the pharmacological actions of the major classes of anti-inflammatory\ndrugs.\n38\nALT-) Volume 7 Number 2\nThe package covers the following subjects:\n\u2022 the main elements of inflammation, major cardinal signs and the timescale of the various\nprocesses involved in the inflammatory response;\n\u2022 the microcirculation;\n\u2022 inflammatory mediators - the synthesis, site and mechanism of actions of histamine,\nbradykinin, nitric oxide, eicosanoids, neuropeptides and cytokines;\n\u2022 cell accumulation - molecular mechanisms involved in neutrophil accumulation at the site\nof injury, adherence, margination and extravasation;\n\u2022 mechanisms of tissue repair and healing;\n\u2022 the pharmacology (name, structure, mechanism of action, and toxicity) of the main drugs:\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n(SAIDs); disease modifying anti-arthritic drugs (DMARDs).\nThe program is highly interactive and makes extensive use of colour graphics (there is a graphic\non most screens), animations (particularly to illustrate dynamic mechanisms like neutrophil\naccumulation, action of mediators and anti-inflammatory agents at cell receptors), a hotword\nfacility (to give additional information on certain topics), a glossary (to define terms which may\nbe unfamiliar to students) and features to promote interactivity, e.g. 'drag and drop' exercises,\nself-assessment questions (MCQs and true\/false with feedback). The content and approach is\ndescribed in more detail elsewhere (Dewhurst et al., 1996).\nThe summative evaluation\nMethod\nThe study was conducted with a single cohort (n=78) of second-year medical students at King's\nCollege, London. The study assessed student knowledge of the subject area covered by the CBL\nprogram and students' attitudes to using CBL compared with traditional teaching methods.\nStudents attended a series of lectures covering five topics in pharmacology. One topic,\ninflammation, was delivered via four one-hour lectures and covered anti-arrhythmic drugs,\ngeneral anaesthetics, muscle relaxants, opioids and inflammation. Two months later the CBL\nprogram was used as part of a series of timetabled three-hour sessions designed to support these\nlectures. Small groups of students (20-25) rotated around each of the support sessions and in\nthe sixth week, when the series was completed, they attended debriefing tutorials. The format\nand approach of the support sessions varied. For example, the anti-arrhythmic support session\ninvolved a trip to theatre and had much more obvious clinical relevance. The CBL package was\nused to provide an additional and different style of learning resource to the lectures, and staff\nrunning the course felt that it was particularly useful in the area of therapeutics and anti-\ninflammatory drugs, which were not covered adequately in the lectures.\nAssessment of student knowledge\nA multiple choice question (MCQ) paper was used as a pre- and post-test to assess students'\nknowledge of inflammation. The paper contained 22 questions, each consisting of a number of\nitems with which the students were required to indicate their agreement or disagreement.\nStudents were instructed not to attempt any items they felt particularly unsure about.\n39\nS. Brain et al Evaluation of a computer-based learning program to support student learning in pharmacology\nThe pre-test paper was administered during the support session before the students used the\nCBL program. The post-test paper, depending on the cohort of students, was administered\nduring the debriefing tutorial. When they had completed the CBL session students were\ninformed that they could continue to use the program for independent study.\nAssessment of student attitude\nAn attitudinal questionnaire was devised which consisted of questions selected to provide\ninformation on three attitude scales (delivery, knowledge, and time and place). This was then used\nas a pre- and post-measure of attitude towards CBL in relation to traditional lectures. Students\ncompleted the questionnaire at the same time as they completed the knowledge test outlined\nabove. The attitude scales used consisted of additive Likert items (Likert, 1932). The delivery\nscale consists of five items (questions) and is interpreted as measuring a positive attitude to\n'whether CBL can replace lectures as an effective delivery medium'. Similarly, the knowledge\nscale consists of four items: positive attitude to 'as much knowledge can be gained from CBL\nprograms as from lectures' and the time and place scale consists of three items: 'CBL allows\nstudents to determine time, place and pace of learning'. The construct validity of the scales was\nassessed using principal component factor analysis and the reliabilities quoted are Cronbach's\nalpha coefficient. Each item on a scale has five points scored from +2 (strongly agree) through 0\n(undecided) to -2 (strongly disagree). The item responses for a particular scale are summed to\ngive that scale's total response. The reliability of the scales were as follows: delivery (pre-test:\n0.80 (n=149); post-test: 0.78 (n=133)); knowledge (pre-test: 0.70 (n=149); post-test: 0.67\n(n=132)); time and place (pre-test: 0.54 (n= 149); post-test: 0.74 (n=132)). Here n corresponds to\nthe number of responses on a particular scale using data from this study and a separate study\n(carried out at Leeds Metropolitan University). The pre-test reliability of the time and place scale\nis low (which could be due to the small number (three) of items in the scale); however, the post-\ntest reliability of this scale was more acceptable and so the scale was retained for the purposes of\nthis study.\nAn additional scale (ease of use) was constructed, for use as a post-test measure, to assess the\nstudents' impressions of the specific CBL program used in this study. This scale had six items\ncovering 'The CBL program was easy to use' and had a reliability of 0.74 (n=133). The\nquestionnaire also contained a question asking for comments on general factors such as ease of\nuse, program design and content.\nResults\nStudent knowledge\nThe results of the pre-and post- knowledge tests are presented in Figure 1. A substantial\nincrease in knowledge (p<0.001, one-tailed paired t-test) was seen in the post-test scores\n(mean+sd: 83.8\u00b110.4; min: 46; max: 96), when compared with the pre-test scores (mean\u00b1sd:\n58.0\u00b114.4; min: 22; max: 82).\nStudent attitude\nThere were 78 responses on each scale in the pre-test attitude questionnaire and 70 responses on\neach scale in the post-test questionnaire. The pre-test attitude on the delivery scale was negative\n(p<0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Pre-test attitude on the knowledge scale was not\nsignificantly different from the zero (undecided) point of the scale (p=0.43). There was a\nsignificant positive attitude on the time and place scale (p<0.001). Analysis of the post-test\nresults showed no change in attitude on any of the scales used (Table 1).

The\nEase of Use scale used only as a post-test measure showed a positive attitude.\nAssessment of students ' prior experience\nAll students in the study were familiar with using computers, with a significant number (62 per\ncent) of students who used computers both inside and outside college. However, only a minority\n(26 per cent) claimed to use them frequently. With the exception of one student, who had not\nused a CBL program before, the majority (78 per cent) had used CBL programs at least three\ntimes prior to the inflammation CBL.\nDiscussion\nThis study relates to one cohort of students at one university using one specific CBL package in\none prescribed way and therefore it is impossible to generalize any conclusions. However, there\nare three major findings from the study. First, it is evident that the use of computers is\nwidespread amongst medical students at King's and that many students are using computers for\nlearning. Second, using the CBL program as a support to lectures does reinforce knowledge of\nthe topic - a significant increase in knowledge was seen after the CBL session on an already\nhigh pre-test knowledge base. (In this study no attempt was made to compare learning through\nCBL with learning through lectures.) Third, students had a slightly negative opinion of CBL as\n42\nALT-] Volume 7 Number 2\na method of delivery compared to lectures both before and after they used the CBL program,\nalthough they did recognize the potential benefits of CBL in terms of study management.\nThe increase in knowledge was perhaps predictable as students were tested shortly (one to six\nweeks) after they had used the CBL program. We attribute the comparatively high pre-test\nscores to students having previously attended lectures on the topic two months earlier. It would\nbe interesting to assess retained knowledge, perhaps one year later, though it is impossible to\ncontrol what additional subject-specific learning students engage in during that period. The\nresults do indicate that a relatively short CBL session would be a useful way for students to\nrevise prior to exams and may be an effective means of introducing students to this form of\nlearning.\nThe attitude scales described here have also been used (by the authors) in a similar study (topic\narea: cardiovascular physiology) with another group of students in a different university. The\nresults of this study are similar and suggest that while students do not feel that CBL provides as\nenjoyable an environment for learning as traditional lectures they are willing to accept that they\ncan in fact learn as much from either approach. What we may be able to conclude from this is\nthat students appear to be most comfortable with a learning environment in which CBL is\nintegrated into a course in which a variety of delivery methods are used.\nIn this study the negative attitude to CBL did not seem to be due to students feeling that the\nparticular CBL program they used was poor. The ease of use scale reflected that opinion was\ngenerally favourable and that most students felt they had extended the range and depth of their\nknowledge base. It should be noted that a significant proportion (48 per cent) of the students did\nnot feel that they had a clear knowledge of the therapeutics of inflammation after using the\nprogram. This was an unexpected response as the program includes a detailed section on this\ntopic. One explanation is that the students did not have time in the three-hour session to go\nthrough this section (many did indeed report that the program was over-long), alternatively it\ncould be that the mechanistic approach taken by the authors in this section was insufficiently\nclinical. In general the package is content-rich and probably contains far too much information\nfor one three-hour session. Students tended to try to work through the package from start to finish\nrather than select areas which cover parts of the course they feel less confident about. To address\nthis it may be appropriate for tutors to direct students to specific sections of the package.\nIn this instance it may be possible to rewrite this section to accommodate some of the students'\ncomments, but it does highlight a potential problem for other educators who may wish to make\nuse of commercial software not developed in-house. Many might reject a particular program if\npart of it is unsuitable, even if the rest of the program meets their learning objectives. For\ndevelopers it suggests that shorter programs covering small topics, which may then be\nassembled by the user into a larger program, may be more useful.\nIn the future the program will be used at King's as an integral part of teaching for medical\nstudents and also for students on a range of non-clinical\/biochemical courses.\nReferences\nAnderson-Harper, H.
