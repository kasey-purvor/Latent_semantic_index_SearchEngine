This paper reviews \nfour major controversies that lie in the areas of a) theoretical ambiguities, b) social \ndeterminism, c) cognitive reductionism and d) lack of a critical agenda. A detailed discussion \nand evaluation of these criticisms reveals that while some can be regarded as \nmisinterpretations, others need to be treated as serious and constructive suggestions for \nextending and refining the current theoretical framework. The main argument underlying this \nreview is that many of the criticisms are based on the difficulty to understand and integrate \nthe complex, dynamic and dialectical relationship between individual agency and social \nstructure that forms the core of social representations theory. Engaging with the critics is thus \nthought to provide clarification and to initiate critical dialogue, which is seen as crucial for \ntheoretical development. \nKey Words: \nsocial representations, social determinism, cognitive reductionism, critical power \n 2 \nSocial representations theory, originally developed by Serge Moscovici (1961), is \ncertainly one of the more controversial concepts in contemporary social psychology. Despite \nits continuing attraction to many researchers and theorists around the world, it has received \nextensive criticism, particularly within the British context. While these critiques demonstrate \nthat the theory of social representations is taken seriously enough to debate (Billig, 1987), we \nconsider a thorough discussion of these objections essential for the conceptual development \nof the theory. It will be shown that whereas some of the criticisms can be regarded as \nmisunderstandings, others need to be treated as serious and constructive points for improving \nor extending the current theoretical framework. Furthermore, engaging with these criticisms \nmay promote a more critical version of social representations theory that invites a social \npsychology of conflict, resistance and social change relevant to today\u2019s world. \nOn the whole, most critics recognise the importance of social representations theory \nwithin social psychology and are sympathetic to its aims and general propositions. In \nparticular, many regard it as a necessary challenge to dominant US-American social \npsychology which they characterise as individualistic, behaviourist and experimentally driven \n(e.g. Jahoda, 1988; Parker, 1987; Potter & Wetherell, 1998). However, it is both in the details \nof its conceptual elaboration as in its practical application that critics find weaknesses. Since \nproblems in the theoretical formulation of social representations are seen as responsible for \nalleged difficulties in its application (Potter & Litton, 1985; Litton & Potter, 1985), it is these \ntheoretical controversies that we will focus on. We point to four central issues that need to be \nclarified or developed: a) ambiguities in defining social representations, b) social \ndeterminism, c) cognitive reductionism and d) the apparent lack of a critical agenda. \nWhat we argue in this paper is that many of the criticisms relate to the complex and \ndynamic relationship between social structure and individual agency put forth in the theory. It \nis this dialectical concept of social life and social cognition that is so much in contrast to the \n 3 \nCartesian dualism still haunting social psychology today (Markov\u00e1, 1982; Farr, 1996). This \nmakes social representations theory difficult to integrate into both US-American and British \nsocial psychology. In many social psychological theories, the relationship between the \npsychological and the social is depicted as a separation of individual perception and \ncognition on the one hand and culture and social context on the other. The unusual position of \nsocial representations as simultaneously between individuals and the societies they live in \n(Howarth, 2001) has led to the contradictory criticisms of social determinism and cognitive \nreductionism. These conflicting critiques call for a detailed review of the theory and its \npropositions, going back to Moscovici\u2019s seminal work La psychanalyse: Son image et son \npublic from 1961. This is where we start. \nA brief introduction to the theory of social representations \nMoscovici developed the theory of social representations from his study of the \ndiffusion of the scientific concept of psychoanalysis among the French public in the 1960s. In \nthe preface of the accompanying book Lagache (1976) asserts that Moscovici\u2019s ideas should \nstimulate and invite social psychological dialogue. Clearly this purpose has been achieved \ngiven the critical discussions and defensive replies the theory has since provoked. In this \nresearch, Moscovici used a combination of questionnaires, interviews and content analysis of \nthe French press and complex sampling procedures with different subgroups of French \nsociety in order to capture a comprehensive overview of diverse bodies of opinion. He did not \nattempt to construct a unified picture but to hold central the heterogeneity and tension he \nfound in the data. \nMoscovici takes Durkheim\u2019s (1898) notion of collective representations as the starting point \nfor his theoretical development. For Durkheim (1898), collective representations are a very \ngeneral category that includes broad elements such as science, ideology, worldview and myth. \nHowever, he does not distinguish between these different forms of organised thought, which \n 4 \nis why, for Moscovici (1961), the concept of representation loses its distinction and clarity. \nMoreover, the concept of collective representation does not reflect the mobile and \nheterogeneous nature of contemporary societies (Howarth, 2001). As Jovchelovitch (2001) \noutlines, the Durkheimian notion refers to a form of knowledge that is produced by a single \nsource of authority, that is strongly resistant to change and that functions to bind societies \ntogether. Yet, Moscovici (1988) makes clear that: \nIt seems to be an aberration, in any case, to consider representations as \nhomogeneous and shared as such by a whole society. What we wished to \nemphasize by giving up the word collective was this plurality of representations \nand their diversity within a group. (p. 219) \nMoscovici (1961) is interested in the relationship between the socio-cultural inter-\nsubjectivity and the psychological organisation of knowledge and so emphasises that we need \nto move towards an active understanding of representations. A representation is not a mere \nreflection or reproduction of some external reality. There is symbolic space in the \ndevelopment and negotiation of representations, which is why all human beings hold creative \npower and agency in their formation and use. By transforming the Durkheimian notion into \nthe concept of social representations, Moscovici deliberately allows for the co-existence of \ncompeting and sometimes contradictory versions of reality in one and the same community, \nculture and individual (Howarth, Foster & Dorrer, 2004). \nThis emphasis on the plural or hybrid nature of social knowledge is also found in the \nconcept of cognitive polyphasia (Moscovici, 1961) that currently receives renewed interest \nfrom social representations theorists (e.g. Jovchelovitch, 2002; Wagner, Duveen, Verma & \nThemel, 2000). This concept implies that different and incompatible cognitive styles and \nforms of knowledge can co-exist within one social group and can be employed by one and the \nsame individual. Depending on the tasks and social settings prevalent at a particular time, \n 5 \nhuman beings can draw on conflicting representations. \u201cCognitive polyphasia thus refers to a \nstate in which different kinds of knowledge, possessing different rationalities, live side by \nside in the same individual or collective\u201d (Jovchelovitch, 2002, p. 124). In this way, so-called \ntraditional and modern representations, which appear contradictory may actually confront \nrather than replace each other (cf. Wagner et al., 2000). \nThe concept of cognitive polyphasia already indicates that the nature of a social \nrepresentation closely relates to its social and psychological functions. But what is the main \nfunction of representation? To put it simply, social representations are \u201cways of world \nmaking\u201d (Moscovici, 1988, p. 231). A more detailed definition that is commonly referred to \ndescribes social representations as: \nA system of values, ideas and practices with a twofold function; first, to establish \nan order which will enable individuals to orientate themselves in their material \nand social world and to master it; and secondly to enable communication to take \nplace among the members of a community by providing them with a code for \nsocial exchange and a code for naming and classifying unambiguously the \nvarious aspects of their world and their individual and group history. (Moscovici, \n1973, p. xiii) \nThis definition highlights that social representations help us to make sense of our world \nand to interact within it with other societal members. They have the main function of \nfamiliarising the unfamiliar since it is the unknown or incomprehensible that may constitute a \nthreat to our socially constructed realities (Moscovici, 1984a). In other words, social \nrepresentations are triggered by the realisation of a gap between what one knows and what \none does not understand or cannot explain (Moscovici, 1961).\n1\n Every representation can \nthereby be understood of being situated inside a dynamic semiotic triangle, as proposed by \nMoscovici (1984b). This triadic relation specifies the three important dimensions of social \n 6 \npsychology generally and of every representation in particular: the object that is represented, \nthe subject that undertakes the representation and the social group whom the subject is \npositioning him- or herself towards in undertaking this representation. The subject-object \nopposition is not enough to fully understand the fundamentally social nature of representation. \nWe need to be in relationship with others to give meaning to the object and to be able to \ndevelop an inter-subjective reality that serves as a common code for communication and \nsocial interaction (Jovchelovitch, 2002). \nThe creation of such an inter-subjective reality through social representation implies \nboth human agency and social influence. On the one hand, social representations are created \nby human beings in order to conventionalise objects, persons and events by placing them in a \nfamiliar social context (Moscovici, 1984a). On the other hand, once established, these \nrepresentations influence human behaviour and social interaction by often subtly imposing \nthemselves upon us and so limiting our socio-cognitive activities. Social representations are \ntherefore not only a product of human agents acting upon their society but are equally \nprescriptive and coercive in nature. They become part of the collective consciousness, \nespecially once they are \u201cfossilised\u201d in tradition and taken for granted in social practice \n(Moscovici, 1984a, p. 13). \nYet, this does not mean that social representations cannot be challenged or changed. In \nthe same way that they are created by human beings they can be modified by them. \nJovchelovitch (1996) highlights that since they act as reference points in every social \nencounter, \u201csocial representations are inseparable from the dynamics of everyday life, where \nthe mobile interactions of the present can potentially challenge the taken-for-granted, \nimposing pockets of novelty on traditions coming from the past\u2019 (1996, p. 124). It is these \ndialectics between agency and structure, tradition and change that have led to different \ncriticisms of social representations theory. Let us now turn to these. \n 7 \nCONTROVERSIES ABOUT THE THEORY OF SOCIAL REPRESENTATIONS \nA) THEORETICAL AMBIGUITIES? \nCertainly the most frequent criticism of the theory of social representations is that it is \ntoo broad and too vague. Moscovici\u2019s writings have been severely criticised as being \n\u201cfragmented and sometimes contradictory\u201d (Potter & Wetherell, 1987, p. 139), as \ndemonstrating a \u201cpolemical style of argument by anecdote\u201d (McGuire, 1986, p. 103) or as \u201ca \npot-pourri of contradictory ideas, seasoned with some pieces of speculative cognitive \npsychology\u201d (McKinlay & Potter, 1987, p. 484). Potter and Litton (1985) do not even give it \nthe status of a theory but rather refer to social representations as \u201ca concept in search of \ntheory\u201d (p. 82). More recently, Valsiner (1998) has reiterated this point in stating that their \n\u201cactual theoretical elaboration has yet to take place\u201d (p. 149). Without greater conceptual \nprecision, critics warn, the concept of social representations is doomed to become a \n\u201cbackground concept\u201d (Billig, 1988, p. 8), a \u201ccatch-all term\u201d (Litton & Potter, 1985, p. 385) \nor \u201ca kind of pseudo-explanation\u201d (Jahoda, 1988, p. 206). \nDespite claims to the contrary (Potter & Litton, 1985), definitions of social \nrepresentations are available in the literature. For instance, Billig (1988) highlights that as \nearly as 1963 Moscovici states that \u201csocial representation is defined as the elaborating of a \nsocial object by the community for the purpose of behaving and communicating\u201d (Moscovici, \n1963, p. 251). Another often cited definition has been given in the brief introduction above. \nHowever, Moscovici is keen not to apply a definition that is too restrictive as complex social \nphenomena cannot be reduced to simple propositions (in discussion with Markov\u00e1, 2001). \nRather than using a hypothetico-deductive model that formulates clear guidelines for testing \nand operationalising a theory, he follows a more inductive and descriptive approach in the \nstudy of social representations. \n 8 \nAnother reason why it makes more sense to characterise rather than define social \nrepresentations is their inherent dynamics. Given their position inside the triadic asymmetry \nof self, other and object, social representations can be very volatile and will transform over \ntime. \u201cThus, attempts to provide an exhaustive definition of such phenomena are based on a \nmisconception of their nature\u201d (Markov\u00e1, 2000, p. 430). Such misconceptions could stem, in \npart at least from language differences and translation. \nIn its early years, the theory was predominately elaborated in French starting with the \nwork of its founding father Moscovici (1961) followed by studies by Herzlich (1969) and \nJodelet (1989). Moscovici\u2019s original work, which lays down the basic concepts and \ntheoretical foundation of social representations, is still not available in English and so \nremains largely inaccessible to Anglo-Saxon social psychologists. R\u00e4ty and Snellman (1992) \nexplain that this has resulted in the theory not entering Anglo-Saxon literature before the \nearly 1980s &ndash; twenty years after its inception. Markov\u00e1 (in discussion with Moscovici, \n2001) particularly regrets the lack of an English translation of the second and lesser known \npart of La psychanalyse which explores the relationship between social representations, \nlanguage and communication. Also more recent work within the area of social \nrepresentations has remained in French, German or Spanish (e.g. Aebischer, Deconchy & \nLipiansky, 1991; Banchs, 1996; Flick, 1991; Wagner, 1994), adding to the language barrier \nfor many English speaking academics. Moreover, every translation into English inevitably \ninvolves a loss or change in meaning, due to the connection between language and culture. \nFor example, one possible reason for misunderstandings in the Anglo-Saxon world lies in a \ndifferent understanding of the word \u2018representation\u2019. Representation in English is \napproximate to \u2018reflection\u2019 or \u2018reproduction\u2019, whereas in French the word carries a more \nactive and purposeful component (Wagner, 1998).\n2\n \n 9 \nLinguistic differences may explain some of the contentions; however we still need to \naddress the specific criticisms of over-generalisation and contradiction. Jahoda (1988), for \nexample, criticises the overlap between the concept of social representation and other \ncategories such as common sense, ideology or culture. Eiser (1986) goes further in accusing \nMoscovici of caricaturing other cognitive theories in order to preserve the distinctiveness of \nhis own theory, thus implying that the theory has little substance or originality. Billig (1988) \nhighlights a specific inconsistency in the use of social representations, in terms of being \ndescribed as both a universal and a particular concept. While a universal sense derives from \ntreating social representations as a concept that exists in every society, a particular sense is \nevident in seeing social representations as peculiar to modern societies. \nIt is very true that the broader a concept becomes the less it can help us to focus on very \nspecific phenomena. In the context of social representations theory, this means that in order \nto reduce its vagueness and overlap with similar concepts we need to clarify what is \ndistinctive about social representations. This is precisely what Moscovici (1961) does in his \nseminal work: he develops the notion of social representation by comparing and contrasting it \nto existing sociological and psychological concepts. He discusses how the notions of \nideology, science and worldview are too general and global to account for the socio-cultural \nspecificity of a representation as a form of knowledge particular to a certain group. This \ndiscussion helps resolve the seemingly inconsistent use of social representations Billig (1988) \nhas noted. Our reading of Moscovici points towards a universal understanding of social \nrepresentations as indispensable features of social life in all cultures. There is sufficient \nevidence to suggest that both traditional and contemporary societies have the capacity to re-\npresent different forms of social knowledge (de-Graft Aikins, 2003). The point is, of course, \nthat conditions of late modernity profoundly impact on the pace at which social \nrepresentations develop, merge and oscillate. Moscovici never argued that social \n 10 \nrepresentations could not exist in traditional societies, but that in late modern times they take \non a more diverse and fragmented form. This is due to the emergence of multiple sources of \npower, authority and knowledge (Foucault, 1980). What has changed today is the structure of \nsociety and thus the lifespan, diversity and fragmentation of social representations, not their \nexistence, creation or influence on social interactions.\n3\n Thus, the social world has a \nfundamental impact on not only what we think but, crucially, how we think. \nAnother reason for Moscovici\u2019s (1961) rejection of the sociological notions of \nideology, science or worldview is that they cannot capture the psychological organisation of \nthat socially produced knowledge. He wants to move beyond a sociological understanding of \nsocial representations \u201cas explanatory devices irreducible by any further analysis\u201d (Moscovici, \n1984a, p. 15). However, turning to existing psychological notions is equally problematic. \nMoscovici (1961) points out that within psychology as a whole the term representation is \nmostly equated with the internal seemingly \u2018biased\u2019 reflection of an external reality. For \nMoscovici an object is not simply reproduced in the mind of an individual but given life \nthrough the socio-cognitive activity of its user that embeds it in a cultural and historical \ncontext. It is not a cognitive process or a social process: it is simultaneously both. \nLooking at the field of social psychology, Moscovici (1961) finds that existing \nnotions do not achieve such an integration of the sociological and the psychological. He \nconcludes that it is necessary to develop a concept that is distinct from notions such as \nopinion, attitude or stereotype, which he describes as short-term responses towards objects \nindependent of the social actors and their intentions. Hence the aim of developing a distinct \nsocial psychological concept marks the beginning of social representation and, indeed, has \nbeen followed by social representations theorists in their elaboration of its relation to other \nconcepts such as social identity (Breakwell, 1993; Duveen, 2001; Howarth, 2002a), \nattributions (Hewstone, 1983; Hewstone & Augoustinos, 1998) or attitudes (Gaskell, 2001; \n 11 \nJaspars & Fraser, 1984).\n4\n Clearly the theoretical ambiguities discussed here do not seem to \nhave caused a rejection of social representations within the discipline but rather provoked \ninterest in refining and developing it, as its rich history of more than forty years of \nstimulating research and debate demonstrates. \nb) Social determinism? \nA more specific criticism of social representations theory relates to an alleged \noveremphasis of social influence (e.g. Parker, 1987) that is said to neglect the human capacity \nof reflexivity (e.g. Jahoda, 1988). Jahoda asserts that people are not described as active agents \nbut as passive entities unable to break free from the existing framework of social \nrepresentations. As such he claims that the theory indicates a revival of the notion of \u2018group \nmind\u2019 whereby the ideas of an elite dominate lay thinking. It is this prescriptive influence on \nhuman activity which Moscovici stresses in saying that social representations \u201cimpose \nthemselves upon us with an irresistible force\u201d (1984a, p. 9) that McKinlay and Potter (1987) \nfind equally unjustified. They argue that as representations are guided by history and tradition, \nthere is not adequate room for social change within the theory of social representations: \nThe reality of yesterday controls the reality of today, says Moscovici, such \nthat intellectual activity constitutes a mere rehearsal or representation of \nwhat has already gone before, in that our minds are conditioned by \nrepresentations which are forced upon us. (McKinlay & Potter, 1987, p. 475) \nThe demand for more consideration of change and dynamics has recently been taken \nup by Hermans (2003). He questions how far social representations theory is able to capture \nindividual responses to the common stock of knowledge and the dynamic multiplicity of \nindependently organising self-positions. \nThe argument that social representations theory paints an overly deterministic picture \nof human relations is closely linked to the criticism of the notion of consensus. It is claimed \n 12 \nthat the theory presents social representation as a process where every mind is infiltrated with \nthe same images and explanations and thus individuals come to develop a consensual view of \nreality. This depiction is unsurprisingly criticised for being an unrealistic version of \npsychology (Parker, 1987; Potter & Litton, 1985). Billig\u2019s (1988, 1993) objection relates to \nthe marginalisation of the psychological and social importance of argumentation. His main \npoint is that an (over) emphasis on the common character of cognition runs the risk of \ndismissing the dialogic or conflicting character of our psychology. To put it simply, without \ncontradiction and conflict there is no \u2018food for thought\u2019 since there is nothing to argue about \nboth with others and with oneself. For Billig (1987), thought is necessarily dialectic and \ninvolves dilemmas and dispute to remain alive. \nWhat is problematic about these criticisms is that they reduce social representations \ntheory to one of its major elements, which is the influence of society on the individual \n&ndash; the impact of culture on cognition. However, as a consequence of its dialectical \nepistemology, one element of the theory cannot make sense without its interrelated \ncounterpart. Culture and cognition exist in a symbiotic relationship to one another. A \nrepresentation is not simply a repetition or replication of some idea presented by a dominant \nsocial group; it involves the deliberate action of those involved. This is something described \nin depth in discussions on the interrelation between social representations and social identity. \nIn their examination of representations of gender in young children, Duveen and Lloyd (1990) \nfor example, specifically describe how human beings evolve in relation to a net of already \nestablished social representations. Duveen (2001) explains that these representations underlie \nthe child\u2019s interactions with parents, teachers and the community. Once confronted with the \nrepresentations that circulate in the community in which the child grows up, however, he or \nshe does not simply absorb and internalise them as they are, but \u201ccomes to re-interpret, to re-\nconstruct, and so to re-present\u201d them to him- or herself (Howarth, 2002a, p. 156). Thus, in the \n 13 \nprocess of \u2018taking on\u2019 social representations, there is always the possibility of re-negotiation \nand so transformation and change. \nVoelklein (2003) emphasises that it is exactly through the contact with conflicting \nsocial representations that human beings begin to reflect on their own views and realise what \nis distinctive about the representations they hold. It is through such dialogue and conflict that \nexisting representations are revisited and adjusted. Hence, the theory cannot be seen as overly \ndeterministic, but rather, as Markov\u00e1 (2000) has argued, \u201cconceives of the dynamics of \nthought, language and social practices as interdependent socio-cultural and individual \nphenomena which are co-constructed by means of tension and polarization of antinomies\u201d (p. \n419). Such a dialogic understanding of social representations also helps us to address the \ncriticism of consensus. Rose, Efraim, Gervais, Joffe, Jovchelovitch and Morant (1995) make \nclear that the idea of consensus as agreement at the level of specific conversations would \ncontradict social representations theory by rendering the concept of social representation \nentirely static and by making communication de facto obsolete. While there must be a certain \ndegree of consensus based upon a common language, tradition and rituals for cognition, \nrecognition and communication to take place, there is also the argumentative level of \nimmediate social interaction that is characterised by fragmentation, contradiction and thus \nsocial change. \nOne possible explanation for this misinterpretation is the equation of the adjective \n\u2018social\u2019 in social representations with their consensually shared nature. However, the social \nnature of these representations is based upon a number of points outlined by Moscovici (1961). \nFirstly, representations make up the common culture and so construct the symbolic boundaries \nand thereby identities of social groups and communities (cf. Howarth, 2002a). Secondly, \nrepresentations are social in the sense that are always collectively created and validated \nthrough processes of communication and social interaction and thus cannot to seen to belong to \n 14 \none individual alone (cf. Rose et al., 1995). Thirdly, representations are social since their \ncontent and specific form is influenced by the historic or economic climate as well as the social \npractices and general cultural context (cf. Jovchelovitch & Gervais, 1999). A certain degree of \nconsensus then is not the sole defining feature of social representations but rather the product \nof the collaborative creation, negotiation and use of social representations. \nIndeed, Moscovici (1985) has made clear that he holds a dynamic and holistic \nunderstanding of consensus that is not synonymous with uniformity. Echoing Billig\u2019s (1987) \nrhetorical approach to social psychology, he argues that social representations always \npresuppose a mixture of diversity and agreement. However, what we can concede is that \nconflict and argumentation are still under-theorised within social representation theory, as \nargued by Potter and Billig (1992). It is therefore time to address social representation as \ndispute and ideological conflict (Howarth, 2005), as without such development, the theory \ncould be seen weak in terms of its power in social critique. \nc) Cognitive reductionism? \nA third major criticism maintains that the theory characterises representation as a \noverly cognitive phenomenon that can chiefly be explained by psychological processes with \nscant reference to social influence (Jahoda, 1988; Parker, 1987; Semin, 1985). McGuire \n(1986), for example, describes social representation as a process of abstracting small units of \ninformation received and assimilating them into pre-existing cognitive (rather than socially \nconstructed) categories. He claims that while social representations introduce \u201cserious errors\u201d \nin cognition through the oversimplification they produce, they are nonetheless \u201ccost \neffective\u201d (McGuire, 1986, p. 102) since they enable coping with an otherwise unmanageable \ncomplexity due to the (assumed) limited nature of human information-processing. \nFor Semin (1985), the problem lies in introducing psychological processes into a \ntheory of social knowledge and societal change. According to him, the main problem derives \n 15 \nfrom the conflict between Moscovici\u2019s aim to shift the level of social psychological analysis \nfrom the individual to the collective while proposing anchoring and objectifying as the two \nkey psychological processes which, for Semin, can be readily subsumed under cognitive \npsychology and again used as an information-processing metaphor. Billig (1993) explains \nthat the reason for this (mis) understanding is that the processes of anchoring and \nobjectification are similar to cognitive psychologists\u2019 descriptions of categorisation and \nschemata. The real mistake is depicting anchoring and objectifying as purely cognitive \nprocesses, or even assuming that there can be \u2018purely cognitive\u2019 processes. Rigorous social \nrepresentations research has highlighted that anchoring and objectification are indeed social, \ncultural and ideological as much as cognitive (e.g. Jodelet, 1991; Voelklein, 2004; Wagner, \nElejabarrieta & Lahnsteiner, 1995). \nRather constructively, Billig (1988, 1993) warns social representations theorists not to \nbecome trapped in the one-sidedness of cognitive psychology, which has neglected \nparticularisation by exclusively focussing on categorisation. The same could happen to social \nrepresentations theory, he argues, if the theorisation of anchoring does not take into account \nthe human abilities to negate and particularise. Moreover, he remarks, anchoring is not an \nautomatic process but might lead to arguments and debate in groups. More critically, Potter \nand Billig (1992) assert that the processes of anchoring and objectification channel social \nrepresentations theory into cognitive reductionism and subsume it under the \n\u201cdecontextualised, desocialised and uncultured universe of laboratory experiments\u201d (p. 16). \nInstead of concentrating on thoughts and beliefs, they argue, social psychology should focus \non the pragmatics of discourse and how social representations are achieved through talk in \npractice. More recently, Potter and Edwards (1999) have related this criticism to an \nopposition between cognition and action. They claim that while discourse theories are \noriented towards accomplishing particular tasks in relation to others, social representation \n 16 \nremains on a perceptual-cognitive and therefore individual level. Similarly, Potter (1996) \nstates that \u201csocial representations are ways of understanding the world which influence action, \nbut are not themselves parts of action\u201d (p. 168). \nTo remedy this alleged overemphasis on cognition, Potter and Litton (1985) would \nlike to re-establish social representations as linguistic repertoires, which they define as \n\u201crecurrently used systems of terms for characterizing actions, events and other phenomena\u201d \nconsisting of \u201ca limited range of lexical items and particular stylistic and grammatical \nconstructions, combined with specific metaphors and tropes\u201d (p. 89). They suggest that this \nreinterpretation would emphasise that representations are linguistically constituted and \nconstructed in specific contexts, and it would have the advantage of not assuming any direct \nlink to identity and social categories. \nDespite these criticisms, social representations theorists would be wrong to hastily \nreject the cognitive dimension of social representations. On the contrary, as one of the central \naims of social representations theory, it is important to reconstitute the essentially socio-\nhistorical nature of cognition. This would release the term \u2018cognitive\u2019 from its rather \nunhelpfully negative connotations. Markov\u00e1 (2000) takes up this issue in detail: she explains \nthat cognition, from a social representational perspective, is based upon a dialogical \nunderstanding of the mind that is rooted within a Hegelian paradigm and the tradition of \ndialogism. Social representations theorists regard cognition as socio-cultural, as dynamic and, \nhence, as something that cannot be simply reduced to the level of the individual (Markov\u00e1, \n2000). Moscovici clearly rejects individualistic versions of cognition. He argues against \ntreating minds as \u201cblack boxes\u201d (1984a, p. 15) and so rather looks at the content of thoughts \nand how these are historically and socially constituted and communicated. \nWhat is often overlooked by critics of this approach is that social representations \ntheory clearly goes further in integrating culture and cognition than approaches of \u2018shared\u2019 or \n 17 \n\u2018distributed\u2019 cognition that have been proposed in other areas of social psychology (cf. e.g. \nResnick, Levine, & Teasley, 1991). Different to these approaches that retain the separation of \nindividual cognition and social interaction and only consider possible relations between them, \nsocial representations theory describes cognition as inherently and inevitably social and \ncultural. Consequently, social representations theory moves beyond the narrow definition of \nsocial cognition as individual cognition about others or influenced by others (Verheggen & \nBaerveldt, 2001). \nA possible reason for the charge of cognitive reductionism from the perspective of \nBritish discursive psychology could lie in their characterisation of cognition and action as \noppositional. It appears here that cognition is equated with something that happens \u2018inside \nindividual minds\u2019 without due attention to its social and ideological production. It is precisely \nsuch a dichotomy of mind and society that social representations theorists seek to challenge. \nHaving challenged the depiction of social representations as mere mental templates, it \nneeds to be made clear that many social representations theorists also object the interpretation \nof social representations as purely linguistic resources. As Moscovici (1985) has clearly \nstated \u201ca discourse is not a representation, even if every representation is translated into a \ndiscourse. All that is image or concept does not entirely pass into language\u201d (p. 92). While \nrepresentations may manifest themselves in language, they do not necessarily have to. We \nmay find social representations objectified in photographs, drawings, films, newspaper \narticles and the media generally &ndash; in any social practice (e.g. de Rosa, 1987; Jodelet, \n1991; Livingstone, 1998; Moscovici, 1961; Voelklein, 2004; Wagner, Kronberger & Seifert, \n2002). Howarth (2005) emphasises that \u201csocial representations are often only apparent in \naction\u201d (p. 7, original emphasis). She gives examples from her research into black British \npupils\u2019 experiences in schools, which illustrate how the representation of \u2018black youth\u2019 is not \nso much expressed in actual dialogue but permeates the institutional cultures of schools, \n 18 \ninforming the actions of teachers, particularly in their social practices of gaze in looking and \nnot looking at black pupils (Howarth, 2004). A linguistic re-interpretation of social \nrepresentations is less likely, we would assume, to capture the institutionalised and historical \nnature of these representations. By concentrating exclusively on \u2018what talk does\u2019, that is by \ntaking a functional stance, British discursive psychology also risks of letting individualism \n\u2018in through the backdoor\u2019 (Jovchelovitch, 1995). The concept of linguistic repertoires \nunderemphasises the social origins of talk and text and overemphasises the content and \nimmediate context of the conversation or document under study. Therefore, it does not only \nmarginalise the wider relational and socio-cultural factors but also the actual social \nproduction and contestation of representation. This would in turn limit the critical potential of \nsocial representations theory. \nSocial representations theory has also been charged with being acritical, in failing to \nseriously address issues of power and ideology (Iba\u00f1ez, 1992; Jahoda, 1988). Parker (1987), \nfor example, asserts that the way Moscovici treats the term ideology \u201cblunts any critical \ncutting edge\u201d (p. 458) as it is turned into \u201ca harmless label for a system of beliefs\u201d (p. 465). \nMoscovici\u2019s (1984a) conceptualisation of ideology relates to his distinction between the \nconsensual and the reified universe, which has been equally criticised. The consensual \nuniverse is the world of common sense. This is often seen as the space in which social \nrepresentations are created, negotiated and transformed. The reified universe, by contrast, is \ninhabited by \u2018experts\u2019, often seen as scientists, who base their judgements of reality on \nexperimentation, logic and rational choice. Moscovici (1984a) has described ideology as a \nmediator between these two universes: \nd) An acritical agenda? \n 19 \nWe see more clearly the true nature of ideologies which is to facilitate the \ntransition from the one world to the other, that is to cast consensual into \nreified categories and to subordinate the former to the latter. Hence they have \nno specific structures and can be perceived either as representations, or as \nsciences. (p.23) \nFor the case of psychoanalysis, Moscovici (1984a) discusses how common sense can \nbe turned into an ideology by being \u201cappropriated by a party, a school of thought or an organ \nof state so that a product, created by the society as a whole, can be enforced in the name of \nscience\u201d (p. 58). This distinction between the consensual and reified universe has been \nfiercely debated by both critics (e.g. Jahoda, 1988; McKinlay & Potter, 1987; Potter & Billig, \n1992; Wells, 1987), as well as advocates of social representations theory (e.g. Flick, 1998; \nFoster, 2003; Howarth, 2005; Purkhardt, 1993). As echoed in a recent article by van Bavel \nand Gaskell (2004), McKinlay and Potter (1987) point out that there is a conceptual \ncontradiction between, on the one hand, stating that all individuals use social representations \nto make sense of their worlds and on the other hand separating the world of science from the \nworld of common sense. Given the fact that Moscovici (1984a) has acknowledged himself \nthat science is equally subject to historical and social influence, he obviously must recognise \nthat scientists like the rest of us rely on social representations in their daily interactions and \nactivities. \u201cIt would, therefore, be a profound mistake to think of science as an \nunproblematically asocial realm of activities in which knowledge of \u2018pure fact\u2019 is generated; \nthe scientist is as much trapped in his social world as is the layman\u201d (McKinlay & Potter, \n1987, p. 479). \nPotter and Edwards (1999) claim that one negative implication of this dichotomy is \nthat it has prevented social representations theorists from considering the impact of their own \nrepresentations in the production of research itself. This last point at least does not appear to \n 20 \nbe justified. Social representations theorists have been critically aware of the possible \ninfluences of their own representations and have discussed the impact of these and of their \nown identities on both the process and products of research (e.g. Farr, 1993; Howarth, 2002b; \nVoelklein, 2004). \nAnother criticism of the relationship between the two universes is that it is often \ndescribed as a one-way process of influence from the reified to the consensual. We can see \nthis in research into the public understanding of science and biotechnology, for example, that \nexplores how scientific or technical concepts become familiarised in common sense (e.g. \nBauer & Gaskell, 1999; Wagner et al., 2002). However, social representations theorists rarely \ninvestigate this relation in the opposite direction &ndash; that is how common sense \ninfluences the content and structure of science (Howarth et al., 2004). This clearly deserves \nattention as both Howarth (2005) and Purkhardt (1993) discuss. If all knowledge is socially \nconstructed so is scientific knowledge. \nYet, the formation of scientific and everyday concepts can be quite distinct due to the \ndifferent conditions and structures of authority and power in both universes. One way of \nunderstanding how these two universes can co-exist within one and the same social world is \nin terms of different modes of thought. Bruner (1985) distinguishes between the narrative and \nthe paradigmatic cognitive functioning or mode of thought that can each be performed by the \nsame person at different times. Whereas the paradigmatic mode of thought is a systematic, \nabstract way of thinking that is based on logic, rigorous analyses, consistency and the \nestablishment of facts, the narrative mode of thought is very concrete, particular and \nconcentrated on human intentions and actions. Myths, well-formed stories, images and rich \nmeanings play an important part in this narrative way of sensemaking. \nTreating the reified and the consensual has two co-existing and interacting forms of \nknowledge has also been proposed by Duveen and Lloyd (1990) and Flick (1998). As Foster \n 21 \n(2003) outlines, there is evidence in Moscovici\u2019s work that he did not want to treat the two \nuniverses as strictly separate from one another. She comes to the conclusion that the \ndistinction between the reified and the consensual is less central to the theory of social \nrepresentations than has been generally assumed and supports this claim by pointing to his \nconcept of cognitive polyphasia. \nA second way out of this overemphasised dichotomy has been proposed by Howarth (2005). \nShe argues that the difference between the consensual and the reified universe points us to the \nprocess of reification that positions certain social representations as \u2018expert knowledge\u2019. \nReification infuses social representations with ideological power by legitimising their \ndominant and dominating position over alternative representations. She argues that in order to \nfully develop the theory\u2019s critical potential, social representations theorists need to analyse \nthe ways in which different knowledge systems become reified in different situations. \nDeveloping Jovchelovitch\u2019s (1997) assertion that some groups have more access to resources \nand thus a better chance of imposing their versions of reality and truth, Howarth (2005) \ninvites us to study the role of power and conflict within the process of social re-presentation. \nBy examining the politics that influence the hegemonic construction of social representations \nwe can gain a better understanding of the interests that are at stake and the alternative \nrepresentations that may be marginalised. This perspective also deconstructs the \nproblematical unidirectional depiction of the relationship between common sense and \nscience.\n5\n \nA critical approach to social representations obviously needs a clearer grasp of ideology. We \nneed to analyse how representations may be infused with ideological power to justify the \nstatus quo and so maintain systems of inequality and exclusion (Howarth, 2004) as well as \ninvestigate how the public takes on, appropriates and contests existing ideologies in their \nrepresentational work (Voelklein, 2003). An ideological perspective emphasises that in the \n 22 \npractice of social life, representations are never neutral but constantly permeated by power \nrelations. Such a critical approach to social representations theory would provide us with the \ntools of evaluating representations in terms of their ability to legitimise and sustain unequal \nand oppressive power relations and marginalising practices. \nConclusion \nThroughout the paper, we have tried to demonstrate that the complexity and dynamics \nbetween society and self-inherent in social representations theory are at the root of many of \nits criticisms and misunderstandings. We have elaborated this peculiar position of social \nrepresentations theory with reference to four major areas of criticism: a) the claim of \ntheoretical ambiguities; b) its portrayal as socially deterministic; c) its contrasting critique of \ncognitive reductionism as well as d) its charge of following an acritical agenda. Through a \ndetailed evaluation of these criticisms, certain points could be revealed to be \nmisinterpretations of social representations theory such as the lack of distinction from other \nconceptualisations, the notion of consensus or the nature of language and cognition. However, \nother points of critique were shown to be important and constructive ideas for theoretical \nrefinement and extension, for example criticisms with regards to the problematic distinction \nbetween the consensual and the reified universe and the underdevelopment of the influence of \nargumentation, conflict, ideology and power on social representations. \nA starting point for investigating the void in treating ideology and power issues in \nsocial representations theory could be to examine whether there is some intrinsic \ncharacteristic of social representations theory that prevents researchers from approaching \nthese issues. One property of the theory as it is currently applied that could be made \nresponsible for this situation is its primary concentration on the content and structure of a \nsocial representation as opposed to its function and broader societal implications. Bauer and \nGaskell (1999) assert that \u201csocial representations research has generally emphasised structure \n 23 \nover function\u201d (p.173) and they \u201ctake it for granted that research on social representations \nwill continue to foreground the comparative analysis of common sense, the contents of \nrepresentations\u201d (p.175). While we appreciate that an understanding of the nature and content \nof a representation is a pre-requisite for discussing its political or ideological consequences, it \nis this extra step in the analysis that is often omitted and that we regard as crucial for \nstrengthening the theory\u2019s critical power. In order to follow a critical agenda we need to \nmove beyond a mere description of the status quo to a consideration of the historical roots, \nthe immediate social function and the future implications of particular representations. That is, \nwe need to examine what social representations do in social and political relations. \nBesides recognising areas for future development, theorists and researchers in this \ntradition may also want to consider how far they contribute themselves to the \nmisunderstandings and criticisms voiced towards social representations theory. Employing \nconcepts and terms that are predominantly associated with a highly individualised \npsychology such as \u2018cognition\u2019 or \u2018representation\u2019 without elaborating how they are to be \nunderstood within the context of their use may easily mislead the casual reader of writings on \nsocial representations. In addition to a lack of definition and elaboration, social \nrepresentations theorists and researchers have also been criticised for incorporating these \nindividual psychological terms uncritically and for hiding behind the cognitive label of \nunfamiliarity reduction that frees them from sufficiently engaging with the social and \nhistorical contexts (Guerin, 2001). Markov\u00e1 (2000) for example asserts that many social \nrepresentations researchers give key social psychological concepts an individualistic and \nstatic instead of a socio-cultural and dynamic meaning. In this way, they do not do justice to \nthe theory\u2019s dialectical and dynamic features and foster stagnation and misconception rather \nthan theoretical development. \n 24 \nFocussing on the dynamic and dialectical aspects of social representations theory is \nalso desirable in terms of widening participation in this theoretical approach. If social \nrepresentations theory comes to be perceived as static and descriptive it is less likely to \nappear suitable for explaining the heterogeneity, tension and change of modern social life \nMoscovici (1961) set out to explore. It is then no surprise that discourse theory becomes an \nattractive alternative. As Potter and Edwards (1999) make clear, what they consider an \nadvantage of a discursive approach over social representations theory is its action orientation \nand its focus on the immediate dynamics of the communicative situation. While a discursive \napproach has its own limitations that we briefly alluded to, a stronger involvement with and \nreflection on the dynamic conceptual features of social representations and their \nmethodological exploration as a socio-cultural practice could open further possibilities for \ntheoretical development. \nAs we have stressed throughout this paper, social representations theorists need to \nchallenge both our critics and peers who marginalise the role of power, dialogue and \nresistance in the development and circulation of representations. We would suggest that \nempirical work in the field should build up a more explicitly critical agenda that promotes a \nsocial psychology of conflict, resistance and social participation in our understanding of the \ninterconnections between social structures and subjectivities, culture and cognition, the social \nand the psychological. It is in this spirit of theoretical advancement and critical engagement \nin social representations theorising and research that this review should be understood. \nAcknowledgments: \nWe would like to thank Wolfgang Wagner, Hubert Hermans and Juliet Foster for reviewing \nthis paper and providing very constructive suggestions.

These \ninclude extensive research into representations of science and new technologies (e.g. Bauer & \nGaskell, 1999; Wagner et al., 2002), of HIV-AIDS (e.g. Campbell, 2003; Joffe 1996) and of \nmental illness (Jodelet, 1991;Schmitz, Filippone, & Edelman, 2003). \n1\n The Oxford Dictionary (1995) defines a representation primarily as \u2018an image, likeness, or \nreproduction of a thing e.g. a painting or drawing\u2019, thus clearly referring to the mirroring \nfunction of representation. \n1\n Conversely, an emphasis on diversity and fragmentation does not mean that there cannot be \nwidely shared or hegemonic representations within contemporary societies (Howarth, 2005; \nMoscovici, 1988). Representations of gender, for example, are remarkably resistant to \nhistorical change (Voelklein, 2003) and contextual factors (Lloyd & Duveen, 1992). \n1\n However, as we discuss below, with Moscovici\u2019s use of the notion of ideology, Jahoda\u2019s (1988) \ncriticism of an unnecessary overlap of certain categories seems to be at least partly justified. \n1\n Such an approach resonates with recent work within the sociology of scientific knowledge (e.g. \nLatour, 1991) that is concerned with identifying the different actors that take part in the \nlegitimisation of certain ideas as science. \nCorina Voelklein \nCaroline Howarth \n 29 \nInstitute of Social Psychology \nLondon School of Economics \nHoughton Street \nLondon \nWC2A 2AE \nelectronic mail: c.voelklein@lse.ac.uk \nc.s.howarth@lse.ac.uk \n \n                                                          \n1 Studies into the development of social knowledge about previously unknown or \nthreatening social objects demonstrate the representational processes involved in \ntaming the unknown.
