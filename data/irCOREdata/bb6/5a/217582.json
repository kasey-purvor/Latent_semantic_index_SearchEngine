By \nencouraging healthier behaviours, it is hoped that \nincentives will help to contain healthcare costs and \nimprove health. If the incentives motivate people in \nhigher socioeconomic groups more than those in lower \nsocioeconomic groups, however, they could exacer\u2011\nbate health inequalities. In the linked analysis article, \nSchmidt and colleagues highlight this as a potential \nproblem in Germany, where a sickness fund rewards \npeople for engaging in preventive activities and for \nminimising use of health care, which might encourage \nthe less well off to forgo needed health care.1\nThese are legitimate concerns, but we should not \nconclude that all incentives harm health equity. Stud\u2011\nies across a range of interventions have shown that \npeople within lower socioeconomic groups do some\u2011\ntimes respond significantly to incentives. Most of these \nstudies were conducted in the United States, but their \nfindings should be applicable to other countries.\nFor example, vouchers redeemable for fruit juice \nsignificantly increased concentrations of \u03b2 carotene in \npregnant women on low incomes.4 This finding con\u2011\ncurs with the Organisation for Economic Co\u2011operation \nand Development\u2019s recent recommendation that cash \npayments or food vouchers should be offered to mate\u2011\nrially deprived pregnant women to boost the take\u2011up of \nantenatal services.5 Early visits to childhood health cen\u2011\ntres and uptake of vaccinations have been increased by \nfinancial incentives in Mexico, Nicaragua, Colombia, \nand Jamaica.2 A $10 (\u00a36; \u20ac6.8) incentive significantly \nincreased the uptake of mammograms in women on \nlow incomes aged 40\u201164 years.6 Financial incentives \nhave also improved participation of intravenous drug \nusers in a hepatitis B vaccination programme and a \ntuberculosis treatment programme.7 8 Several other \nexamples of the positive effects of financial incentives \nhave been published.9 10\nThese studies show that in some areas of health care \nmodest financial incentives can substantially affect the \nbehaviours of the relatively poor. Healthcare incentives \ndo not always have a positive effect, however, and evi\u2011\ndence of a positive sustained effect on more complex \nlifestyle behaviours, such as smoking or weight loss, is \nlacking.3\nSome of the studies may have volunteer bias\u2014 \nvolunteers may be particularly motivated to change their \nbehaviour\u2014and few studies provide adequate information \non costs, let alone value for money. Moreover, the stud\u2011\nies do not test the differential effect of incentives on the \nrelatively poor versus the better off. Because less wealthy \npeople do respond to incentives, health inequalities could \nbe reduced if incentives were targeted at them.\nTargeting certain groups is controversial because it \ncan breed resentment in the untargeted population. This \ncan undermine solidarity, a key feature of European \nhealthcare systems. Also, should the target be set at \nthe family level (for example, families whose income \nis below a certain amount) or the geographical level \n(poor communities)? Because pockets of wealth often \nexist in poor communities, targeting at the family level \nseems the most sensible choice. Targeted interventions \nmay be the best option in the current global financial \nclimate because they are less expensive than those \naimed at the population.\nanaLySIS, p 725\nadam Oliver rcUK senior \nacademic fellow, LSe Health, \nLondon School of economics, \nLondon Wc2A 2Ae \na.j.oliver@lse.ac.uk\nCompeting interests: Ao is a \ncodirector of cSi Health (centre \nfor the Study of incentives in \nHealth), but he is not ideologically \nfor or against the use of \nincentives. cSi Health is funded \nby a strategic award in biomedical \nethics from the Wellcome Trust \n(grant no 086031\/Z\/08\/Z).\nProvenance and peer review: \ncommissioned; not externally \npeer reviewed. \nCite this as: BMJ 2009;339:b3847\ndoi: 10.1136\/bmj.b3847\n706   BMJ | 26 SEPTEMBER 2009 | VoluME 339\neDITORIaLS\nEvidence indicates that appropriately targeted \nincentives could reduce inequalities in health out\u2011\ncomes.

Intracranial aneurysm rupture is \na rare but devastating complication of AKPKD that \noccurs on average 10 years younger than sporadic \nintracranial aneurysms. The youngest reported case \nwas a 13 week old infant, and in one study 10% of \npatients were younger than 21 years.2 Intracranial \naneurysm rupture is associated with a death rate of \nup to 65%. Treatment of a ruptured intracranial aneu\u2011\nrysm by either neurosurgical clipping or endovas\u2011\ncular treatment also carries an unacceptably high \nmortality rate of 8\u201110% and morbidity (disability or \ndependency) rate of 16\u201121%.3 \nThe risk of rupture of asymptomatic intracranial \naneurysms occurring in the general population is \nprimarily determined by size, location, and a his\u2011\ntory of rupture.4 For instance, the rate of rupture for \nintracranial aneurysms less than 10 mm in diameter \nA child receiving an oral \nvaccine in Mexico\nKe\niT\nH\n d\nAn\nn\neM\niL\nLe\nr\/\nAL\nAM\ny\nalbert c M Ong professor of renal \nmedicine, Academic nephrology \nUnit, Faculty of Medicine, \ndentistry and Health, University \nof Sheffield, Beech Hill road, \nSheffield S10 2rX \na.ong@sheffield.ac.uk\nCompeting interests: none \ndeclared.\nProvenance and peer review: not \ncommissioned, externally peer \nreviewed. \nCite this as: BMJ 2009;339:b3763\ndoi: 10.1136\/bmj.b3763\n"}
