The presence of helium alters the fragmentation\npatterns when compared with the gas phase, with some ion product channels being more strongly a\ufb00ected than\nothers, most notably cleavage of the Ca\u2013H bond in the parent ion to form the corresponding oxonium ion.\nParent ion intensities are also enhanced by the helium, but only for the two cyclic alcohols studied, cyclopentanol\nand cyclohexanol, is this e\ufb00ect large enough to transform the parent ion from a minor product (in the gas phase)\ninto the most abundant ion in the helium droplet experiments. To demonstrate that these \ufb01ndings are not unique\nto alcohols, we have also investigated several ethers. The results obtained for both alcohols and ethers are\ndi\ufb03cult to explain solely by rapid cooling of the excited parent ions by the surrounding super\ufb02uid helium,\nalthough this undoubtedly takes place. A second factor also seems to be involved, a cage e\ufb00ect which favors\nhydrogen atom loss over other fragmentation channels. The set of molecules explored in this work suggest that\nelectron impact ionization of doped helium nanodroplets does not provide a su\ufb03ciently large softening e\ufb00ect to\nbe useful in analytical mass spectrometry.\n1. Introduction\nFragmentation of molecular ions is commonplace in electron\nimpact (EI) mass spectrometry. It has advantages in analysis,\nsince it allows identi\ufb01cation of speci\ufb01c functional groups\nthrough the appearance of characteristic fragment ions. How-\never, it can also be a serious disadvantage, particularly for large\nmolecules and for mixtures of molecules, where extensive\nfragmentation frequently obscures analyte assignments. As a\nresult, alternative techniques have been developed for ionizing\nmolecules in mass spectrometry, such as chemical ionization,\nmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and elec-\ntrospray. These techniques tend to produce ions with much less\nfragmentation than electron impact ionization and are often\nreferred to as \u2018soft\u2019 ionization methods.\nA softer form of electron impact ionization is potentially\npossible by attaching the analyte molecule to, or embedding\nthe molecule within, a weakly bound cluster in the gas phase.\nWhen this cluster is ionized by EI, additional bodies are\npresent to help absorb and remove any excess energy and if\nsu\ufb03ciently e\ufb00ective this might reduce fragmentation of the\nanalyte ion. Stace and co-workers have explored this idea using\nargon clusters, which were formed in a supersonic gas expan-\nsion. Several small organic molecules, such as dimethyl\nether,1,2 diethyl ether,3 acetone,4 methanol5 and methyl for-\nmate,6 were added to the argon clusters and subjected to\nelectron impact ionization. It was found that extensive frag-\nmentation occurs even with the molecules attached to argon\nclusters of various sizes, although the fragment ion distribu-\ntions did change from those of the isolated molecule mass\nspectra. The data obtained were rationalized as follows. The\nevidence points to a molecule sitting on the surface of the argon\ncluster, rather than being embedded inside. For clusters of\nsigni\ufb01cant size, the most likely ionization site on being struck\nby an electron will be an argon atom. The argon ion formed\nthen transfers its charge to the organic molecule and simulta-\nneously deposits several eV of excess energy into the organic\ncation (from the di\ufb00erence in ionization energies of the argon\natom and the organic molecule). Although the surrounding\nargon is capable of removing some of this excess energy from\nthe parent ion, e.g. by evaporative loss of argon atoms, for\nmany ion channels this process is too slow to be signi\ufb01cant and\nso fragmentation of the organic ion is still observed and the\nionization process cannot be described as soft.\nHelium nanodroplets have emerged recently as a potentially\npromising environment for soft electron impact ionization. The\nproperties of helium nanodroplets are remarkable.7,8 They are\ndroplets of liquid helium formed in supersonic gas expansions\nand can be composed of anything from a few dozen helium\natoms to in excess of 108 helium atoms.9 A temperature of\n0.38 K (for 4He) is maintained through evaporative loss and\nany molecule colliding with the droplet is likely to stick to, and\nthen embed itself within, the droplet. 4He nanodroplets are\nsuper\ufb02uid, allowing excellent mobility of molecules within the\ndroplets and this fact, coupled with the potentially enormous\ncooling rate possible by evaporative loss of the very weakly\nbound helium atoms, leads to the possibility of rapid cooling of\nparent ions formed by electron impact ionization.\nA mechanism for the ionization process in helium droplets\nhas been described by Toennies and co-workers10,11 and devel-\noped further by Janda et al.12,13 The starting point is to\nrecognize that it is highly unlikely that an incoming electron\nwill directly ionize a molecule deep in the interior of a helium\ndroplet. Instead the process is thought to begin by impact of\nthe electron with a helium atom at or near the surface of the\ndroplet, forming He1. The positive charge can transfer be-\ntween adjacent helium atoms but after several such hops it\nbecomes localized either by ionizing the dopant molecule (if\nencountered in the hopping chain), or by formation of He2\n1. In\neither case heat is released and this can be partly or fully\nremoved by loss of helium atoms or ions, including cluster ions\nsuch as He2\n1.\nSurprisingly, there have been relatively few mass spectral\nstudies of molecules in helium droplets. The \ufb01rst hint of soft\nionization of dopant molecules in helium droplets came from a\nR E S E A R C H P A P E R\nP\nC\nC\nP\nw\nw\nw\n.rsc.o\nrg\n\/p\nccp\nD\nO\nI:\n1\n0\n.1\n0\n3\n9\n\/b\n5\n1\n1\n6\n2\n8\ng\n4082 P h y s .

It was subsequently found that the SF6\n1 signal was\ndue to SF5\n1 clustered with a water molecule,14 the distinction\nbetween SF6\n1 and SF5\n1\u2013H2O not being made in the original\nstudy because the mass resolution was relatively low. However,\nlater studies have indicated that EI of doped helium droplets\ncan be a signi\ufb01cantly softer process than EI of bare molecules.\nJanda and co-workers have recorded EI mass spectra of both\npure and doped helium droplets.12,13,15,16 Amongst this body\nof work was a report of soft ionization of NO dimers, the\nparent ion of which is almost entirely fragmented in the gas\nphase but which remains largely intact when ionized in helium\ndroplets composed ofB15 000 helium atoms.12 Most recently\nof all, Miller and co-workers have carried out a detailed\ninvestigation of the electron impact ionization of triphenyl-\nmethanol in helium droplets of various sizes.17 A substantial\nchange in the fragmentation pattern was found for triphenyl-\nmethanol in helium droplets compared with EI of the isolated\nmolecule, with the \u2018softening\u2019 e\ufb00ect increasing as the size of the\nhelium droplet increased. Miller and co-workers also brie\ufb02y\npresented the mass spectrum of n-butanol in helium droplets,\nwhere the softening e\ufb00ect of the helium is much smaller than\nseen in triphenylmethanol. This suggests that a helium droplet\nis not a universal \u2018softener\u2019 of electron impact ionization\nprocesses.\nIn this paper we present the \ufb01rst detailed study of electron\nimpact mass spectra of a series of molecules in helium nano-\ndroplets. The focus is mainly on alcohols, which tend to show\nextensive fragmentation in their gas phase EI mass spectra.\nHowever, a small number of ethers are also included for\ncomparative purposes. By choosing a series of related mole-\ncules, our aim is to try and identify any general trends in ion\nfragmentation behavior in helium nanodroplets. We employ\nlarge nanodroplets with an average size of 50 000\u201360 000\nhelium atoms. Droplets of this size have the capability to\ndissipate B30\u201335 eV of energy by evaporative loss of helium\natoms, and yet we \ufb01nd in most cases that the helium droplet\nhas only a modest e\ufb00ect on the fragmentation patterns of the\nmolecular ions. The major exceptions to this are the two cyclic\nalcohols studied, cyclopentanol and cyclohexanol, where the\ndi\ufb00erence between the gas phase and helium droplet spectra is\nstriking. However, for all the molecules we \ufb01nd a major\nincrease in the branching ratio for the parent ion decomposi-\ntion channel involving loss of one H atom, which we interpret\nas evidence for a cage e\ufb00ect by the surrounding helium solvent.\n2. Experimental\nHelium droplets were produced using a pulsed nozzle. The only\nprevious published report of helium droplets formed in a\npulsed source was by Vilesov and co-workers.18 Our pulsed\nnozzle is similar to that employed by the Vilesov group and\nconsists of a commercial pulsed valve (General Valve series 99)\nwhich was modi\ufb01ed to allow operation at temperatures as low\nas 6 K. The nozzle was cooled by contact with a closed-cycle\ncryostat (Sumitomo Industries RDK-408D cold head with\nCSW-71D compressor) and the temperature was measured\nusing a diode sensor located very close to the nozzle.\nThe three interconnected vacuum chambers in our experi-\nmental apparatus are illustrated in the schematic diagram in\nFig. 1. The pulsed nozzle and cold head are located in the \ufb01rst\nchamber, which is pumped by a di\ufb00usion pump. The helium\ndroplet expansion produced from the nozzle is skimmed to\nform a droplet beam and then \ufb02ows through a small pick-up\ncell (length 7 cm) located in a second vacuum chamber. This is\nthe point in the apparatus where analyte gases are added, the\nsamples in this work being derived from the headspace above\nthe corresponding liquid. The headspace vapor is carried into\nthe pickup cell using helium as a carrier gas and the pressure in\nthe pickup cell is \ufb01ne tuned using two needle valves in series.\nThe pressure is monitored by an ion gauge located on a tube on\nthe opposite side of the pickup cell from the gas inlet tube.\nTypical partial pressures of the dopant gas in the pickup cell\nwere in the region of 10\u00016 mbar.\nThe \ufb01nal vacuum chamber houses a re\ufb02ectron time-of-\ufb02ight\nmass spectrometer, which was designed and built by Kore\nTechnology (Ely, UK). The mass spectrometer has a nominal\nresolution (m\/Dm) of 3000 and can therefore easily distinguish\nbetween ions di\ufb00ering in mass by one dalton. Droplets entering\nthe source region of the mass spectrometer are ionized by a\npulsed electron beam at a \ufb01xed energy of 70 eV. The \ufb01ring of\nthe electron beam is timed to coincide with the arrival of each\npulse of helium droplets. The mass spectrometer is equipped\nwith a dual microchannel plate detector, a preampli\ufb01er, and an\nion counting system for accumulating the mass spectral data.\nIn the experiments reported here the nozzle was set for a\nnominal opening time of 150 ms and \ufb01red at a repetition rate of\n10 Hz. High purity helium (99.9999%) was employed at a\ntypical stagnation pressure of 20 bar and a nozzle temperature\nof 11 K. Under similar experimental conditions Vilesov and co-\nworkers determined an average droplet size of 5 \u0002 104 helium\natoms.18 We have independently determined the droplet sizes\nin our experiments using a procedure that has been described in\ndetail elsewhere and parallels that used by many other research\ngroups.19 Brie\ufb02y, the probability that a droplet acquires one or\nmore dopant molecules is governed by Poisson statistics.\nConsequently, the observed variation in monomer or cluster\nion signals with partial pressure can be \ufb01tted to a Poisson\ndistribution by using the droplet size as the \ufb01tting parameter.\nBy this means we obtained a value ofB6 \u0002 104 helium atoms,\nwhich is in good agreement with Vilesov\u2019s determination.\nSince this work focuses on the electron impact ionization of\nsingle dopant molecules in helium droplets, the partial pressure\nof the dopant gas in the pick-up cell was kept deliberately low\nin order to avoid the formation of signi\ufb01cant quantities of\nmolecular clusters, whose presence might complicate the inter-\npretation of mass spectral fragmentation patterns. In experi-\nments to be reported elsewhere, we have also carried out\nmeasurements at much higher dopant partial pressures to\nprobe the fragmentation of alcohol cluster ions in helium\nnanodroplets. For most of the alcohols studied here the cluster\nmass spectra are dominated by protonated cations, MnH\n1,\nwhere M is an alcohol monomer and Mn is the corresponding\nn-mer cluster. These ions must originate from larger clusters,\nmost likely the fragmentation of Mn11\n1 ions. Consequently,\nthe integrated ratio of monomer ion signals to the MH1 signal,\nwhich is seen in all of our mass spectra, can be used to estimate\nthe ratio of monomer to dimer concentrations. In all instances\nthis ratio was found to be c10, showing that the dimers and\nlarger clusters play a negligible role in the work reported here.\nAll samples were obtained from standard chemical suppliers\nwith a minimum purity of 97%, and in most cases better than\n99%. Each sample was placed in a small cylindrical stainless\nFig. 1 Diagram showing the main components of the experimental\napparatus (not to scale).\nP h y s . C h e m . C h e m .

Despite\nattempts to minimize background gases, substantial signals\nfrom N2, O2, and H2O were seen in all experiments. This\nre\ufb02ects the weakness of the helium droplet ion signals, rather\nthan excessive amounts of background gases, and typically\nseveral thousand spectra were accumulated to attain an ade-\nquate signal-to-noise ratio. The background gases originated\nmainly from within the mass spectrometer chamber (which\nnevertheless gave a base pressure o10\u00018 mbar) and the\namounts of these contaminants picked up by the helium\ndroplets were found to be negligible.\n3. Results\nThe molecules chosen for investigation were mainly alcohols,\nalthough a few ethers were also included. The precise choice\nwas determined partly by availability of the compounds in our\nlaboratory and also by the need to avoid those compounds that\ngave too many fragments coinciding with Hen\n1 cluster ions (as\nwell as other abundant background ions such as H2O\n1, N2\n1\nand O2\n1). The helium droplet spectra were restricted to\nelectron impact energies of 70 eV, since this is the typical\nimpact energy employed in analytical EI mass spectrometry.\nFor comparison with the helium droplet data, mass spectra of\nall the chosen molecules were also recorded with the same\ninstrument but in the absence of helium droplets. This gave\nmass spectra of the bare molecules and these were found to be\nvery similar to those available in the NIST mass spectral\ndatabase.20\n3.1 Alcohols\nPrimary alcohols. It is well known that the fragmentation\npatterns of primary alcohols become steadily more complex as\nthe length of the hydrocarbon chain(s) increase.21,22 The parent\nion is always a minor product at 70 eV in the gas phase and for\nthe longer chain alcohols is barely detectable. Ionization of\nsaturated alcohols is initiated by loss of an electron from the\noxygen atom. In the case of the lighter alcohols the fragmenta-\ntion that then results is dominated by the formation of\noxonium ions, as shown for ethanol below:\nCH3CH2OH- CH3CH2O\n1H- CH3 \u00fe CH2QO1H\nFor ethanol the cleavage of the C\u2013C bond at the a carbon leads\nto the characteristic oxonium fragment ion at m\/z \u00bc 31, which\nis the major ion in the 70 eV EI mass spectrum in the gas phase\n(see the lower panel in Fig. 2). However, cleavage of the C\u2013H\nbond at the a carbon is also possible leading to the oxonium\nion CH3C(H)QO\n1H at m\/z \u00bc 45, one mass unit below the\nparent ion.\nThe upper panel in Fig. 2 shows the EI mass spectrum of\nethanol in helium nanodroplets. In addition to peaks arising\nfrom the ionization of ethanol, the spectrum shows a series of\nintense Hen\n1 cluster peaks characteristic of the electron impact\nionization of helium nanodroplets. Although it is in principle\npossible to subtract the Hen\n1 peaks from the spectrum to\nreveal the organic ion peaks only, by recording a second\nspectrum with the ethanol gas source turned o\ufb00, in practice\npulse-to-pulse \ufb02uctuations in gas intensity lead to a very noisy\ndi\ufb00erence spectrum. We have therefore chosen to present raw\nmass spectra in this work. For each molecule we have carefully\nchecked that the contribution to the mass spectrum from\nmolecules not picked up by the helium droplets was negligible.\nThis was achieved by raising the temperature of the nozzle to\ndestroy the droplets, leaving all other experimental conditions\nthe same. It is also noteworthy that all the helium nanodroplet\nmass spectra presented in this paper show total Hen\n1 signals\nfar in excess of the organic ion signals. This is consistent with\nthe expected large size of the helium nanodroplets quoted\nearlier, for which a low charge transfer probability to the\norganic dopant molecule is expected.\nThere are substantial di\ufb00erences in relative intensities of the\nmass peaks arising from ethanol in helium nanodroplets\ncompared with the gas phase spectrum. The two oxonium ions\nremain the most abundant organic ions, but the peak due to\nloss of the a hydrogen is now stronger than that due to cleavage\nof the methyl group. The parent ion is relatively weak in the\nhelium droplet spectrum but the peak at m\/z \u00bc 43, which\ncorresponds to loss of H2 from the CH3C(H)QO\n1H oxonium\nion, has gained intensity relative to that of the parent ion and is\nnow much the stronger of the two peaks. Clearly the helium\ndroplet has a substantial e\ufb00ect on the relative intensities of the\npeaks, although the mass spectrum is still recognizably that of\nethanol.\nThe other primary alcohols investigated in this work were 2-\nmethyl-1-propanol, n-butanol, and 1-pentanol. For these\nmolecules fragmentation channels other than just oxonium\nion formation become signi\ufb01cant. For 2-methyl-1-propanol\nand n-butanol there are di\ufb00erences in fragmentation patterns\nbetween the gas phase and helium droplet spectra, but as for\nethanol these di\ufb00erences for the majority of ions are not\nprofound. The main exception is the channel due to loss of\nthe a hydrogen atom to give a peak at M \u0001 1, where M is m\/z\nfor the parent ion. The M \u0001 1 peaks for both molecules are\ndramatically enhanced relative to the gas phase spectrum, in\nline with the \ufb01nding for ethanol. The parent ion peaks also\nshow much higher intensities than in the gas phase spectra,\nalthough they remain weak. This is particularly noteworthy for\nn-butanol, where in the gas phase the parent ion is barely\nobservable. The mass spectra recorded for n-butanol are shown\nin Fig. 3. As part of a detailed study concentrating mainly on\ntriphenylmethanol, Lewis and co-workers in a recent publica-\ntion brie\ufb02y presented the mass spectrum of n-butanol in helium\ndroplets.17 In contrast to triphenylmethanol, where the helium\nsolvent produces softer ionization resulting in a dramatic\nenhancement of the parent ion peak, in n-butanol the parent\nion was found to remain weak even in very large droplets (4 \u0002\n104 helium atoms). Lewis et al. presented this spectrum to\ncounter the impression that helium droplets always act as\nstrong quenchers of ion fragmentation processes. We reach\nessentially the same conclusion about the low intensity of the\nparent ion, but the much higher mass resolution in our experi-\nments clearly shows the dramatic enhancement in the M \u2013 1\nchannel.\nThe most marked di\ufb00erences between gas phase and helium\ndroplet spectra for the primary alcohols investigated were\nfound for 1-pentanol. The parent ion is several hundred times\nweaker than the prominent fragment ions in the gas phase\nFig. 2 Mass spectra from ethanol in helium nanodroplets and in the\ngas phase at room temperature. The peaks marked with asterisks in the\nhelium droplet spectrum correspond to helium cluster ion peaks. The\npeak marked w in the lower spectrum is from residual O2\n1 in the\nvacuum system, and which of course will also contribute to the peak at\nthe same position in the upper spectrum.\n4084 P h y s .

TheM \u0001 1 peak, which is also barely detectable in\nthe gas phase spectrum, is comparable in intensity to all the\nmajor fragment peaks in the helium droplet spectrum. How-\never, there are other striking changes in relative intensities in\nmoving from the gas phase to helium droplets. For example,\nthe major peak in the gas phase spectrum is at m\/z \u00bc 42, which\ncorresponds to the loss of both H2O and C2H4. It has been\nproposed that the loss of these molecules occurs simulta-\nneously through a cyclic transition state,21 as illustrated\nmechanistically below.\nThe fragment ion arising from this process su\ufb00ers a major\ndecline in relative abundance in the helium droplet mass\nspectrum, while some other nearby peaks gain in their relative\nintensities.\nSecondary and tertiary alcohols. Mass spectra of four sec-\nondary alcohols (2-propanol, 2-butanol, 2-pentanol and 2-\nmethyl-3-pentanol were studied along with one tertiary alco-\nhol, t-butanol. The \ufb01ndings were similar to those reported for\nthe primary alcohols, and as an illustration we show the gas\nphase and helium nanodroplet EI mass spectra of 2-propanol\nin Fig. 5. Both the parent ion (M) and the M \u0001 1 peaks are\nminor features in the gas phase spectrum, the major peak being\ndue to the oxonium fragment CH3C(H)QO\n1H at m\/z \u00bc 45.\nThe helium droplet enhances the proportion of the M \u0001 1 ion,\nbut that aside there are strong similarities between the gas\nphase and helium droplet spectra.\nCyclic alcohols. Two cyclic alcohols were selected for inves-\ntigation, cyclopentanol and cyclohexanol. It is for these two\nmolecules that the helium solvent shows most impact. Fig. 6\nshows mass spectra recorded for cyclopentanol. The most\nnotable observation is that the weak parent ion peak in the\ngas phase spectrum is transformed into the most intense\norganic ion signal in the helium droplet spectrum. Almost as\nabundant as the parent ion is the M \u0001 1 ion, a species absent\nfrom the gas phase spectrum. All the fragmentation channels\nactive in the gas phase spectrum are also seen in the helium\ndroplet spectrum, but there are clear di\ufb00erences in branching\nratios. The major peak in the 70 eV gas phase spectrum\nof cyclopentanol is at m\/z \u00bc 57, which corresponds to the\nFig. 3 Mass spectra from n-butanol in helium nanodroplets and in the\ngas phase at room temperature.

The key \ufb01ndings for cyclo-\nhexanol are similar to those for cyclopentanol.\n3.2 Ethers\nDiethyl ether, diisopropyl ether and methyl t-butyl ether were\ninvestigated. In many respects the mass spectrum of diethyl\nether in helium nanodroplets resembles that seen for the\nisolated molecule in the gas phase. Paralleling the alcohols,\noxonium ion formation can occur by a-cleavage,21 as shown\nfor the diethyl ether cation below:\nCH3CH2\u0001O\u00fe\u0001CH2CH3 ! CH3CH2O\u00feQCHCH3 \u00feH\n! CH3CH2O\u00feQCH2 \u00fe CH3\nThe processes above yield fragment ions at m\/z \u00bc 73 and 59 in\naddition to the parent ion peak at 74. The M \u0001 1 peak at 73 is\nvery weak in the gas phase spectrum but the ion at m\/z \u00bc 59 is\none of the more abundant fragments. Secondary fragmentation\nis a characteristic feature in the mass spectra of ethers, some of\nthe main channels for diethyl ether being\nCH3CH2OCH\n\u00fe\n2 ! C3H\u00fe5 \u00feH2O\n! CH2OH\u00fe \u00fe C2H4\n! C2H\u00fe5 \u00fe CH2O\nGas phase and helium droplet mass spectra of diethyl ether are\ncompared in Fig. 7. They are similar in many respects,\nalthough there are some di\ufb00erences in relative intensities.\nHowever, as per the alcohols, the one major di\ufb00erence is a\ndramatic enhancement of the M \u0001 1 channel.\nDiisopropyl ether is an interesting target for EI mass spec-\ntrometry in helium droplets because in the corresponding gas\nphase spectrum the parent ion has a low abundance. Instead\nthere are a number of di\ufb00erent fragment ions, with by far the\nmost abundant being that at m\/z \u00bc 45. A plausible fragmenta-\ntion scheme that accounts for the major peaks is as follows:\nThe helium droplet spectrum di\ufb00ers from the isolated molecule\nspectrum in several ways (see Fig. 8). As seen for other mole-\ncules, a relatively strong M \u0001 1 peak at m\/z \u00bc 101 is observed\nwhich has negligible intensity in the gas phase spectrum.\nParticularly striking in Fig. 8 is the dramatic reduction in the\nabundance of the HO1QCH(CH3) cations at m\/z \u00bc 45 relative\nto the other organic peaks. A peak at 59, corresponding to the\nisopropoxy cation, (CH3)2CH\u2013O\n1, is now equally abundant\nand yet in the gas phase this is a very minor product. The e\ufb00ect\nof the helium on the mass spectrum is clearly more pronounced\nfor diisopropyl ether than for diethyl ether.\nFinally, we recorded the EI mass spectra of methyl t-butyl\nether. For this example the helium droplets had a much smaller\ne\ufb00ect on the mass spectra than seen for diisopropyl ether, the\nonly notable di\ufb00erence being, once again, an enhancement in\nthe M \u0001 1 channel.\n4. Discussion\nThe above results clearly show that electron impact ionization\nof helium droplets doped with alcohols and ethers gives\ndi\ufb00erent ion fragmentation patterns when compared with gas\nphase samples. However, it is also clear that in most cases these\ndi\ufb00erences are quantitative rather than qualitative and vary in\nextent from molecule to molecule. The question arises as to\nwhat role the helium plays in the ionization and subsequent\nfragmentation process, and therefore what is the source of the\ndi\ufb00erences between ionization in a helium droplet and in the\ngas phase?\nAn important distinction between gas phase EI and helium\ndroplet EI concerns the energetics. As discussed in the Intro-\nduction, an incoming electron is unlikely to strike a dopant\nmolecule in a helium droplet unless it is at or very near the\nsurface. We would expect all the molecules chosen for inves-\ntigation in this work to be fully solvated by the helium, i.e. on\naverage they will reside within the droplet. As a result, the\ninitial ionization event will in almost every case involve pro-\nduction of He1, which can then subsequently transfer its\ncharge to the dopant molecule. The \ufb01rst ionization energy of\na helium atom is 24.6 eV, with a similar value being expected in\na helium droplet. Typical \ufb01rst ionization energies of simple\nalcohols fall in the range of 10\u201311 eV, with those of ethers\nbeing marginally lower. Consequently, a maximum of 15\u201316\neV of excess energy could be deposited into the parent ion on\ncharge transfer from He1. This is clearly a substantial amount\nof energy, although much less than that potentially available\nfrom 70 eV electron impact on the bare molecule. Could this\ndi\ufb00erence in available energy account for all of the di\ufb00erences\nbetween the gas phase and helium droplet spectra? We can\nFig. 7 Mass spectra from diethyl ether in helium nanodroplets and in\nthe gas phase at room temperature.

As an illustra-\ntion, Fig. 9 shows the mass spectrum of gaseous 1-pentanol at\n15 eV impact energy. This corresponds to a much lower energy\n(B5 eV) available for depositing into the parent ion than is the\ncase in a helium droplet and yet the mass spectrum in Fig. 9 is\nvery di\ufb00erent from the helium droplet spectrum in Fig. 4.\nClearly, the greater excess energy available from 70 eV electron\nimpact ionization of the bare organic molecules is not in itself\nsu\ufb03cient to account for the di\ufb00erences between gas phase and\nhelium droplet mass spectra.\nAnother factor in play for helium droplets is the potential for\ncooling the parent and fragment ions. If this takes place on a\ntimescale comparable to, or faster than, the dissociation rate of\nthe energized ion, then this could reduce the degree of frag-\nmentation. Super\ufb02uid helium is known for its extremely high\nthermal conductivity, and claims have been made for an\nevaporative cooling rate as high as 1010 K s\u00011.23 A droplet\nsize of 60 000 helium atoms is more than large enough to\ndissipate 15 eV of excess energy through evaporative loss alone\n(B1600 helium atoms eV\u00011). In the limit of full dissipation of\nthe excess energy we would see only parent ions, which is\nclearly not what is observed. However, a partial cooling e\ufb00ect\nmight account for some of the changes in mass spectra between\nthe gas phase and helium droplets.\nTo explore this further, we consider a speci\ufb01c example,\nethanol. The dissociation pathways of ethanol cations and\ntheir energetics have been extensively studied. The best avail-\nable threshold energies for formation of the parent ion and the\ntwo main fragments are 10.64 eV (C2H5OH\n1), 10.80 eV\n(CH3CHOH\n1) and 11.4 eV (CH2OH\n1).20 At 70 eV in the\ngas phase the formation of the oxonium ion CH2OH\n1 is\nfavored over the alternative oxonium ion CH3CHOH\n1. How-\never, in view of their relative appearance energies at much\nlower excitation energies the branching ratio should begin to\nshift in favor of CH3CHOH\n1 over CH2OH\n1. This is supported\nby photoionization studies, and in particular a PEPICO study\nby Niwa and co-workers found that the crossover point occurs\nat a photon energy of B11.5 eV.24 The same group was not\nable to distinguish between the amounts of CH3CHOH\n1 and\nthe parent ion due to a lack of mass resolution. However,\nBowen and Maccoll have recorded a gas phase mass spectrum\nat an electron impact energy of 12.1 eV and found that, in\naddition to an excess of CH3CHOH\n1 over CH2OH\n1, the\nparent ion is the most abundant ion.25 On the basis of these\ndata, we can explain the preponderance of CH3CHOH\n1 over\nCH2OH\n1 in our helium droplet experiments by invoking\nextensive and rapid cooling of the parent ion. However, the\npresence of a weak parent ion, together with a substantial\n[M \u0001 H3] peak, whose threshold appearance energy has been\ndetermined as 14.5 eV,20 suggests that rapid ion cooling is not\nthe only factor a\ufb00ecting the fragmentation pattern.\nThe one feature common in all of the helium droplet mass\nspectra recorded in this work is the greatly enhanced branching\nratio for hydrogen atom loss compared with the gas phase\nspectrum. What is often a minor, or even negligible, fragmen-\ntation channel in the gas phase becomes a major channel in\nevery one of the molecules investigated. As already seen for the\nethanol cation, the loss of a hydrogen atom from the a carbon\natom to form an oxonium ion is a relatively low energy\nfragmentation channel which is available to all of the molecules\nstudied in this work. Extensive cooling by the helium matrix is\ntherefore more likely to favor this channel over more energetic\nfragmentation processes. However, the dramatic enhancement\nin the M \u0001 1 channel without, in most cases, any comparable\nincrease in parent ion production, suggests that energetics\nalone does not account for the di\ufb00erences between the gas\nphase and helium droplet spectra.\nA possible explanation is that the helium surrounding the\ninitially formed cation acts to some extent as a cage, favoring\nthe escape of small energetic fragments over slower moving\nheavy species. A recent study of VUV excitation of water\nmolecules in helium nanodroplets has shown that predissocia-\ntion (to form OH \u00fe H) from electronically excited states is not\nhindered by the surrounding helium, demonstrating that the\ncage e\ufb00ect for H atom loss is negligible.26 The predissociation\nof neutral molecules is not exactly analogous to the situation in\nthis work, where we are dealing with the dissociation of\ncations. The helium atoms immediately adjacent to the cation\nwill form a more tightly bound \u2018sheath\u2019 around the dopant\nspecies than in the neutral case, providing more of a barrier to\nfragmentation. For example, path integral Monte Carlo calcu-\nlations on Na1Hen clusters show that the layer of helium\nimmediately surrounding the ion behaves like highly com-\npressed solid helium due to the strong ion-induced dipole\nforces between Na1 and helium atoms.27 The larger ions\nstudied in the present work will produce a less tightly bound\ninner solvent shell but we nevertheless expect this helium layer\nto possess a density and rigidity characteristic of solid helium.\nA cage e\ufb00ect by this solvent layer would favour hydrogen atom\nloss over ejection of larger fragments since the departure of the\nformer requires less disruption of the rigid solvent shell. The\noccurrence of a cage e\ufb00ect might also account for the decline in\nthe H2O \u00fe C2H4 loss channel for the 1-pentanol cation. As\nmentioned earlier, this fragmentation process is likely to\nproceed through a cyclic transition state whose formation will\nbe obstructed by the tightly bound helium solvation layer.\nHowever, the above comments neglect the fact that the initially\nformed cation is not cold, as would be the case with an atomic\nion, but is highly energized as a result of the charge transfer\nprocess. Cooling of the ion by the helium droplet may heat the\nhelium layers in close proximity to the ion to the point where\nformation of an e\ufb00ective rigid or semi-rigid solvation cage is\nimpossible. A full interpretation is dependent on the relative\nrates of ion cooling by the helium versus unimolecular ion\nfragmentation. This is a complex dynamical problem and\ntheoretical studies would be of great assistance in elucidating\nthe detailed role of the helium in unimolecular ion fragmenta-\ntion.\nFinally, we comment on the role of the size of the helium\ndroplets. The droplets in this work are comparable in size to\nthe largest used in the EI mass spectrometric study of triphenyl\nmethanol by Lewis et al.17 and are considerably larger than\nthose employed by Janda and co-workers.12,13,15,16 It is con-\nceivable that even larger droplets might achieve still more\ne\ufb00ective ion cooling, perhaps reaching the point at su\ufb03ciently\nlarge sizes (c105 helium atoms) where the parent ion is the\nonly product. However, even if this were the case, it is not clear\nthat such large droplets will eject only bare ions, and may\nFig. 9 Mass spectrum of gaseous 1-pentanol at an electron impact\nenergy of 15 eV.

In addition,\nthe probability of charge transfer from He1 to the dopant\nmolecule diminishes rapidly as the size of the droplet increases.\nLewis et al. found their maximum usable droplet size to be\n40 000 helium atoms, the dopant ion signal being unacceptably\nsmall for larger droplets. In our work we too obtain weak\ndopant ion signals and require averages of several thousand\nmass scans to achieve a respectable signal-to-noise ratio. It\nseems likely that larger droplet sizes will not be e\ufb00ective for EI\nmass spectrometry and so the conclusions reached in this work\nabout the quenching of ion fragmentation are at the limit of\nwhat is practically achievable with helium droplets.\n5. Conclusions\nThe alcohols and ethers chosen for investigation in this work\nserve to illustrate the key e\ufb00ects of the helium solvent on\nelectron impact mass spectra and allow us to draw some\ngeneral conclusions. First, the in\ufb02uence of the helium is not\nthe same for all molecules. For example, the 70 eV EI mass\nspectra of aliphatic alcohols in helium nanodroplets broadly\nresemble those in the gas phase. There are some consistent\ndi\ufb00erences in relative fragment intensities, most notably the\nmajor enhancement of the M \u0001 1 peaks in the presence of\nhelium. The situation di\ufb00ers, however, for the cyclic alcohols,\nwhere the impact of the helium is more dramatic. The M \u0001 1\npeak is again enhanced considerably relative to other fragmen-\ntation channels, but the key di\ufb00erence for the two cyclic\nalcohols investigated here, cyclopentanol and cyclohexanol, is\nthat the parent ions become the major ions in the mass\nspectrum, in contrast to the gas phase where they are very\nminor products. These are clear examples of a softening e\ufb00ect\nproduced by the helium matrix.\nOur \ufb01ndings indicate that rapid cooling of parent ions by the\nhelium does take place, which in turn a\ufb00ects the branching\nratios for ion fragmentation pathways. However, this cooling\nis incomplete, even for the large droplets employed in the\npresent experiments, and cooling alone does not appear to\naccount for all of the observations, particularly the major role\nplayed by the loss of a hydrogen atom from the parent ion in\nhelium droplets. We tentatively suggest that a cage e\ufb00ect is also\nin operation which enables facile departure of hydrogen atoms\nat the expense of channels that produce larger fragments.\nFinally, we note that even though we have found substantial\nquantitative changes in the mass spectra of several molecules in\nhelium droplets compared with the gas phase, these changes\nare unlikely to be helpful to an analytical chemist who is\nseeking a new type of soft ionization. Of course the situation\nfor molecular ions larger than those studied here, which\ngenerally fragment on a slower timescale than small molecules,\nmay be more dramatic and the recent study on triphenylmetha-\nnol by Lewis et al. indicates that this may be the case.17\nHowever, we conclude from the present study of small and\nmedium sized alcohols and ethers, and a separate study of the\nEI mass spectra of haloalkanes,28 that fragmentation of parent\nions remains a major process in the electron impact ionization\nof molecule-doped helium nanodroplets.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to the UK Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council for \ufb01nancial support of this work.\nDr Graham Eaton is also acknowledged for recording the low\nenergy EI mass spectrum of gaseous 1-pentanol.\nReferences\n1 A.
