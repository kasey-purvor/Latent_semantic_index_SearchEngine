Reflections on a Busy Decade in Dead \nSea Scrolls Research* \n \nIn what follows I would like to outline and reflect upon the ways in which the study of \nthe Dead Sea Scrolls has seen some momentous transformations during the last decade or \nso leaving us currently in a period of scholarship that is both exciting and humbling at the \nsame time. I will move from the texts and the scribes to the caves, and finally the \ncommunity of scholars. My aim is to give a flavour of some of the milestones, \nchallenges, and little triumphs we have encountered over the course of the last ten years \nrather than attempting anything like a systematic let alone comprehensive overview. \n \nThe Texts \nStarting with the texts, the first and most obvious transformation we have witnessed is \nthat we are at long last able to see the big picture. The texts are published and accessible, \nas are a number of remarkable tools.1 Amongst the scholarly tools now available Martin \n                                                 \n* This article is a revised version of a plenary lecture delivered at the SBL Annual \nMeeting in San Diego in 2007.  I would like to thank Profs. Moshe Bernstein and Maxine \nGrossman for the invitation as well as Prof. Michael E. Stone for his comments on a draft \nof this lecture. I also gratefully acknowledge the support of the British Academy in the \nform of an Overseas Conference Grant. \n1 For an overview over the official publication series see now E. Tov, \u2018The Discoveries in \nthe Judaean Desert Series: History and System of Presentation\u2019, in E. Tov et al., The \n2 \nAbegg\u2019s two-volume Concordance takes pride of place.2 Thus, despite the fact that 2007 \nmarked the 60th anniversary of the discovery of the scrolls, during the first four to five \ndecades of this period scrolls scholarship was simply a different world. On the one hand, \nthe first generation of scholars are rightly recognised today for their brilliance as \nepigraphers and palaeographers who paved the way for much of the scholarship that is \nproduced today and beyond. During the last decade we also lost some of these fathers of \nthe discipline, most recently Josef Milik (1922-2006) and Hartmut Stegemann (1933-\n2005). The task of deciphering and identifying fragments is, however, by no means \ncomplete. Even the DJD editions, like so many Second Temple texts, do not necessarily \nrepresent a fixed text, and the ongoing work of paleographers such as Emile Pu\u00e8ch and \nEibert Tigchelaar is a frequent reminder of this.3 On the other hand, the first generation \nscholarly community was rather stagnant by today\u2019s standards. Because of the huge \namount of progress made in terms of publishing the texts in the last two decades or so, to \n                                                                                                                                                 \nTexts from the Judaean Desert.

Tov, Dead Sea Scrolls Electronic Library, p. 11. \n \n3 \na large degree thanks to the quiet and capable authority of the Editor-in-Chief Prof. \nEmanuel Tov, it is almost as if, for the majority of scholars, the discovery of the texts \nhappened much more recently. In other words, we recently celebrated the 60th \nanniversary of the discovery of the scrolls, full access to all the unpublished texts for the \nlast seventeen years had, in practical terms, a huge impact on scholarship, comparable \nalmost to the impact of the initial discoveries.4  \n \nAs far as the big picture painted by the texts themselves is concerned, I would like to \nfocus on a number of areas where the impact of the recent publications has transformed \nthe field:  \n \nThe first significant consequence of beholding the full spectrum of texts is the way in \nwhich the sectarian component is now dwarfed by two thirds of scriptural and non-\nsectarian writings as spelt out very clearly by Devorah Dimant in 1995.5 If one asked a \ngroup of scholars to compile a list of the sectarian compositions, the resulting lists are \n                                                 \n4 For an excellent overview over the controversial publication history of the Scrolls see \nJ.C. VanderKam, \u2018Scroll Wars\u2019, in J. C. VanderKam and P. Flint, The Meaning of the \nDead Sea Scrolls. Their Significance for Understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus, and \nChristianity, London, T&T Clark, 2002, pp. 381-403. \n55 D. Dimant, \u2018The Qumran Manuscripts: Contents And Significance\u2019, in D. Dimant and \nL. H. Schiffman (eds.), Time To Prepare The Way In The Wilderness.

This situation is not at all \nunlike what we now think of as the scriptural \u2018canon\u2019 at this period.6 Not unlike the \nnotion of a canon of scriptural texts, so also the notion of a \u2018canon\u2019 of sectarian texts is an \nissue that occupies modern scholars rather more than Late Second Temple Jews. The \nattitude of this conservative Jewish group to texts, including also such treasured and \nvalued texts as the scriptures and the rule texts, is surprisingly tolerant and open-minded \nby our standards. The fluidity of textual traditions across the board at Qumran is one of \nseveral areas where scholarship gained as much from \u2018unlearning\u2019 old preconceptions as \nit did from learning new things. \n \nAnother area where the amount of new material has raised the stakes of its centrality is \nthat of Jewish law. Some of the halakhic issues raised in this literature burst the narrow \nconfines of Qumran. See for instance the important overlap between some of the scrolls \nand some of debates recorded in the Mishnah noted some time ago by Joseph \nBaumgarten and Larry Schiffman and most recently addressed in a volume entitled \n                                                 \n6 See, e.g., E. Ulrich, \u2018The Bible in the Making: The Scriptures Found at Qumran\u2019, in P. \nW. Flint (ed.), The Bible at Qumran.

Rabbinic Literature and the Dead Sea Scrolls edited by Steven \nFraade and others.7 The now much larger corpus of legal texts from Qumran leaves us in \nlittle doubt that it was legal debate rather than a clash of two alpha males that lies at the \nheart of the differences between Jews at the time.8 I was struck by an interesting recent \nargument between two Jewish scholars on this point with Ben Zion Wacholder referring \nto Joseph Baumgarten\u2019s work as characterised by a \u2018nomistic approach\u2019 and preferring \ninstead what I would call a maximalist eschatological interpretation of the Damascus \nDocument.9 I am sure the nomistic approach is the right one, mainly because of the \ndominant place of law in the texts rather than simply in the scholarly approach. \n. \nSapiential texts have emerged as a major new player on the Qumran stage. The last \ndecade saw the publication of two volumes in the DJD Series of Sapiential Texts10 as \n                                                 \n7 (STDJ, 62), Leiden, Brill, 2006. \n8 See also J.

On the one hand, the new texts, especially 4QInstruction, challenge our \nunderstanding of what made the communities tick and provide some curious and subtle \nevidence of links to the sectarian material.12 These texts further emerged just at a time \nwhen the boundaries between wisdom and apocalypticism were being challenged and \nprobed. I am thinking here of the SBL Symposium Volume edited by Benjamin G. \nWright and Lawrence M. Wills entitled Conflicting Boundaries in Wisdom and \nApocalypticism.13 How apt that a bombshell like 4QInstruction with its wonderful \namalgam of instruction and revelation should have become new essential reading for \nanyone working on these questions just as they were beginning to be re-formulated. \n                                                 \n11 Cf., inter alia, J. J. Collins, G. Sterling and R.

Hempel, \u2018The Qumran Sapiential Texts and the Rule Books\u2019, in Hempel, Lange, \nand Lichtenberger (eds.), Wisdom Texts from Qumran, pp. 277-295. \n13 Atlanta, Society of Biblical Literature, 2005. \n7 \nMatthew Goff\u2019s contribution (\u2018Wisdom, Apocalypticism, and the Pedagogical Ethos of \n4QInstruction\u2019) to the collection just referred to fleshes out this point. \n \nEqually important transformations were inaugurated by the publication during the last \ndecade of additional Cave 4 copies of a number of long known texts. I will focus here in \nparticular on the Damascus Document (D) and the Community Rule (S). In trying to \nassess the significance of these texts I will stand back from the finer points of numerous \nscholarly cruxes that they pose. The inter-relationship of both texts has long been \nrecognized as a major crux in the study of the Scrolls. Perhaps the single most telling \npiece of new evidence is a substantial amount of penal code material now attested in both \ndocuments. \n \nLike two talented and charismatic primadonnas, the Damascus Document and the \nCommunity Rule have managed to stay in the limelight for most of the last 60 years (and \nmore in the case of CD). Each primadonna has her own charms, and the reasons why both \ntexts have managed to hold as well as recapture our attention more recently are quite \ndifferent in each case. The publication of the full text of the Cave 4 manuscripts of the \nCommunity Rule by Philip Alexander and Geza Vermes in 1998 and the earlier work by \nthe editors themselves and Sarianna Metso in particular have presented us with a rich \npicture of an evolving ancient textual tradition that is almost growing in front of our eyes \n8 \nas we study the differences and similarities between the different manuscripts of the \nCommunity Rule.14 \n \nIn the case of the Damascus Document the publication of the full text of the Cave 4 \ncopies by Joseph Baumgarten has equally transformed the study of this text, but in quite \ndifferent terms. Here we are not faced with breathtaking variants between one manuscript \nand another, but rather with a large amount of new text, largely, though not exclusively \nlegal in character. Although the various manuscripts of the Damascus Document from \nQumran show very few signs of development, some portions of their text are so close to \nthe Community Rule that they almost look like variant manuscripts of the same text. This \nis the case, for instance, with the penal code traditions mentioned briefly already, and this \nimportant and curious phenomenon has been called \u2018synoptic intersections\u2019 by Steven \nFraade.15  \n \nBoth for the Rule and for the Damascus Document as well as for the corpus of Qumran \nmanuscripts as a whole, the full publication of the texts has not only disclosed a vast \n                                                 \n14 See esp. P. S. Alexander and G. Vermes, Qumran Cave 4. XIX. Serekh Ha-Yaad and \nTwo Related Texts (DJD 26), Oxford, Clarendon, 1998 and most recently C. Hempel, \n\u2018The Literary Development of the S Tradition \u2013 A New Paradigm\u2019, RQ 22 (2006) 389-\n401 and S. Metso, The Serekh Texts, London, T&T Clark, 2007. \n15 S. Fraade, \u2018Ancient Jewish Law and Narrative in Comparative Perspective: The \nDamascus Document and the Mishnah\u2019, in A. Edrei and S. Last Stone (eds.), Dine Israel. \nStudies in Halakhah and Jewish Law 24 (2007) 65-99, esp. p. 93. \n9 \namount of new and significant evidence, but the new evidence in turn has transformed the \nstudy of the familiar material as well. Thus, from the more distanced vantage point that I \ntried to adopt, I am struck by the way in which the study of D and S mirrors the study of \nthe larger corpus in some remarkable ways. The important new light shed by more recent \ndevelopments on the old was recently consciously and explicitly addressed in a meeting \nof IOQS in Ljubliana earlier this year as well as a recent Orion symposium - meetings \nwhich attempted to look back to the finds of Cave 1 or \u2018Old Texts\u2019 respectively in the \nlight of recent developments.16 These meetings point towards an extremely fruitful \navenue for reflection, namely, the re-visitation of material that is by now fairly familiar \nwith a view to question whether what we thought we knew still holds up to scrutiny. \n \nPrior to the boom of publications from Cave 4 over the course of the last fifteen years or \nso, the corpus of the Qumran texts may be likened to a pool of water, relatively calm and \nrelaxing. We are now still sitting in the same water, but the pool has been substantially \nenlarged, more water has poured into it at a steady pace, and a powerful jacuzzi has been \nswitched on mixing the water in new ways. What we have is new material of such scope \nand significance that it also radically challenges the ways in which the long familiar texts \nare read. It is true to say, therefore, that even though now we celebrate and mark the 60th \nanniversary of the discovery of the DSS, it is as if we have only just begun \u2013 again. This \n                                                 \n16 For The Tenth Annual Orion Symposium: New Perspectives on Old Texts, cf. \nhttp:\/\/orion.mscc.huji.ac.il\/symposiums\/10th\/main.shtml and the 2007 IOQS meeting in \nLjubliana, cf. http:\/\/www.iosot2007.si\/temp\/index_03_3.html. \n \n10 \nis not to say that the significance and value of the work of our elders is in any way \ndiminished but the complexity and richness of the full spectrum of texts has injected a \nlarge dose of humility into our once confident scholarly ethos. \n \nThe Scribes \n \nWe saw already with reference to the Community Rule manuscripts how the Scrolls are \nproviding fascinating insights into the ways in which ancient texts grew. A little over ten \nyear ago Geza Vermes recognized the significance of this when he wrote, \n\u201cIf one had to single out the most revolutionary novelty furnished by Qumran, the \nchoice of its contribution to our understanding of the genesis of Jewish literary \ncompositions would surely be justified.\u201d17  \n \nDuring the last decade scholars have rightly begun to reflect very seriously on the role of \nthe scribe. First and foremost to be mentioned here is the magisterial volume by Emanuel \nTov, Scribal Practices and Approaches Reflected in the Texts Found in the Judean \nDesert18, which offers us a treasure trove of information on the practical aspects of \nwriting. Related to this, George Brooke has recently published a stimulating paper \nentitled \u2018The Qumran Scrolls and the Demise of the Distinction between Higher and \nLower Criticism\u2019 where he argues, as the title of his paper suggests, that the distinction \nbetween higher and lower criticism is severely challenged by the evidence of the \n                                                 \n17 G. Vermes, The Dead Sea Scrolls. Qumran in Perspective, London, SCM, rev. third \nedn. 1994, p. 23.  \n18 (STDJ 54), Leiden, Brill, 2004 \n11 \nscrolls.19 Almost at the same time Emanuel Tov wrote an important article entitled \u2018The \nWriting of Early Scrolls. Implications for the Literary Analysis of Hebrew Scripture\u2019.20 \nBoth Brooke and Tov emphasize the important insights gained by the Scrolls about \ncreative writing and creative copying. These issues were in the air already as indicated by \nShemaryahu Talmon\u2019s wonderful coinage \u2018insufficiently controlled copying\u2019 with \nreference to the scrolls, and Geza Vermes who refers to \u2018scribal creative freedom\u2019 in a \nsimilar context.21 \n \nThese very recent discussions shed light on the much bigger question of what it means to \nspeak of an author in antiquity. It may be worth noting in this context that the role of the \nredactor or editor in Hebrew Bible scholarship has recently been subjected to a critical \n                                                 \n19 In J.

The Fourteenth Sacks Lecture, Oxford: Oxford Centre for Postgraduate \nHebrew Studies, 1987, p. 14. \n12 \nanalysis by John van Seters.22 He goes so far as to speak of \u201cthe myth of the \u2018redactor\u2019 \nand redaction criticism\u201d23 and prefers instead to think of those responsible for the \npentateuch as historians. Whether or not we like the labels \u2018redactor\u2019, \u2018redactional\u2019 or \n\u2018editing\u2019 with reference to ancient Hebrew literature, it is quite clear from the crucial \nevidence of the Community Rule manuscripts in particular that the kinds of processes \nscholars refer to with this terminology did take place. \n \nThe Caves \nAnother consequence of being in a position to look at the bigger picture that has produced \na number of stimulating discussions most recently is the work being done on profiling the \ncollection. We have already referred to the ways in which the classification of the texts \ninto sectarian and non-sectarian as well as pre- or proto-sectarian and scriptural texts is \nongoing. Another avenue of recent research has been attempts to draw up a profile of the \ncontents of the caves. A recent article by Daniel Stoekl-Ben Ezra reviews the debate thus \nfar and offers his own analysis.24 Two papers read in the autumn of 2007 by Florentino \nGarc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez and Jodi Magness at an international conference at the University of \nBirmingham can now be added to this growing list of studies.25 \n                                                 \n22 The Edited Bible.

Another burst boundary is also evident in the make-up of \nthe scholarly community today compared to the early decades of Qumran studies. After a \nfairly uncommunicative four decades the last two decades have witnessed some \nenormous transformations. In 1993 Florentino Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was instrumental in the \ncreation of the International Organization for Qumran Studies which bi-annually brings \nscholars together. Moreover, the Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls and \nAssociated Literature at the Hebrew University founded by Michael Stone and currently \nheaded by Steven Fassberg has recently celebrated its 10th anniversary. The work of the \nCenter has enriched our field by offering a first class website which I am sure has a fuller \nbibliography of scholarly publications than some of the authors keep themselves of their \nown work.26  \n \nThe religious allegiances of the original team of editors are regularly discussed, and the \nabsence of Jewish members from the original team of editors for several decades is still \nbaffling. As someone who entered the field just at the right time (I started my doctoral \nwork in 1991), I relish the fact that what we have today is a community of scholars made \nup of Jews, Christians, atheists, agnostics, men and women who are united by their \npassion for trying to understand the texts as best we can. We are studying texts that \npredate the \u2018parting of the ways\u2019 but it took us far too long to come together as a \nscholarly community. It looks as if we may perhaps be achieving this now.

Most recently \nthere is a sense that the immense challenges posed by this remarkable collection of \nmanuscripts are finally producing genuine dialogue and conversations between scholars \nof different faiths, backgrounds, genders, and generations. The nineteen nineties were an \nexciting decade in Qumran Studies, but in many ways the last ten years have been even \nmore fulfilling from a scholarly point of view simply because we have been in a position \nto gaze at the big picture in all of its dazzling complexity. \n                                                \n \nCharlotte Hempel, University of Birmingham \n \n \n27 \u2018Currents in Qumran Scholarship: The Interplay of Data, Agendas, and Methodology\u2019, \nin R.
