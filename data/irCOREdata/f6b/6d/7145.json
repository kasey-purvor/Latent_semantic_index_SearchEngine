One of the major problems of such an approach is\nthat it has drawn higher education practitioners into thinking that their objective is to\ncomply with rules. I argue that it is not (Seale, 2006). The objective should be to\naddress the needs of students. The danger of only focusing on rules is that it can\nconstrain thinking and therefore practice. We need to expand our thinking beyond\nthat of how to comply with rules, towards how to meet the needs of students with\ndisabilities, within the local contexts that students and practitioners are working. In\nthinking about how to meet the needs of students with disabilities, practitioners will\nneed to develop their own tools. These tools might be user case studies, evaluation\nmethodologies or conceptualizations: \nThe descriptions of what we know about current accessible e-learning practice are multi-\nlayered and complex. There may be value therefore in seeking to draw from these descrip-\ntions a conceptualization of accessible e-learning practice that: offers a simplified way of\nrepresenting what we know about accessible e-learning; highlights what we know, what we\ndon\u2019t know and what we need to know; offers new or different ways of thinking about\naccessible e-learning in the future. (Seale, 2006)\nUsing Wenger\u2019s notion of \u2018Communities of Practice\u2019 as a framework (Wenger,\n1998), I argue that while the accessible e-learning community has tools and procedures\n(legislation, guidelines, standards, policies and automated evaluation tools), it lacks\nthe complete and detailed concepts that are required for a coherent practice to emerge\nand develop (Seale 2004, 2006). In addressing issues of disability, technology and e-\n*School of Education, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK. Email:\nJ.K.Seale@soton.ac.uk\n2 Editorial\nlearning in higher education, the contributors to this issue challenge us to conceptu-\nalize or re-conceptualize our understanding of: \n\u25cf assistive technology;\n\u25cf best accessibility practice; and\n\u25cf taking responsibility for accessibility.\nRe-conceptualizing assistive technology\nGeraldine Price offers the metaphor of assistive technology as a \u2018scaffold\u2019 that guides\nand facilitates participation. Through the use of three in-depth student case studies\nPrice also demonstrates how assistive technology does not have to be specialized or\ncomplex to be useful. Sometimes, simple solutions or features of standard packages\ncan be very effective in supporting the needs of students with disabilities. This is partic-\nularly important given that many who work in student support services are beginning\nto realize that students need a significant amount of training and support to use their\ntechnological equipment, particularly complex equipment (Downie, 2000; Haines &\nMolenaar, 2000; Keller et al., 2000; Henderson, 2002; Sajka & Roeder, 2002).\nAs E. A. Draffan and Peter Rainger argue: \nAssistive technologies have a learning curve and it is essential to ensure adequate training\ntime is provided and that the training is provided in the context of the students\u2019 own learn-\ning and course requirements.\nDraffan and Rainger also argue against a conceptualization (categorization) of assis-\ntive technologies that focuses solely on the disability of the user and fails to take into\naccount their skills, abilities and preferences.\nMike Wald explores how Automatic Speech Recognition can be re-conceptualized\nas a technology that can assist with receptive as well as expressive communication,\nwhile David Sloan and colleagues challenge our understanding of assistive technology\nby arguing that multimedia can be viewed as an assistive technology for people with\na range of needs: \nFor all these groups, arguably the most inaccessible way of presenting information is\nthrough a long page of on-screen text. It follows that presenting information in alternative\nways\u2014pictures, diagrams, animated diagrams, video clips, audio recordings\u2014is far more\neffective in conveying information and experiences, and hence supporting comprehension\nand retention of information. Multimedia thus becomes an accessibility solution\u2014an\nassistive technology.\nConceptions of best \u2018accessibility\u2019 practice\nThe contributions in this issue conceptualize best \u2018accessibility\u2019 practice in a number\nof ways. Best practice is conceptualized as: \n\u25cf focusing on learning;\n\u25cf flexible, adaptable and proactive; and\n\u25cf holistic.\nEditorial 3\nBest practice focuses on learning\nFor many of the contributors, best practice involves not focusing solely on the tech-\nnical aspects of accessibility (e.g. accessibility guidelines), but also taking into account\nthe context in which users are trying to access online materials and resources: the\ncontext of learning. Some contributors go further than this and argue that best\npractice takes the focus away from a learner\u2019s disability or from e-learning. For exam-\nple, Draffan and Rainger present a model for the identification of challenges to\nblended learning for students. In doing so they argue against approaches that focus\non remediating the perceived \u2018problems\u2019 that students with disabilities have: \nThe model proposed, provides a starting point for the identification of challenges to learn-\ning from a socio-cultural perspective rather than a medical or rehabilitation perspective.\nThis holistic perspective is key to moving \u2018thinking\u2019 towards a more inclusive learning\napproach that embraces the needs of all learners such as those for whom English is a\nSecond or Other Language (ESOL) regardless of a defined disability.\nSimilarly, Lawrie Phipps and Brian Kelly argue that there is a need to provide acces-\nsible learning experiences, and not necessarily accessible e-learning experiences.\nBest practice is flexible, adaptable and proactive\nThe contributors conceive of flexibility in slightly different ways and contexts. For\nexample, in discussing how dyslexic students use technology and software to support\ntheir learning, Price argues that it is the flexibility of use that makes the difference for\nthem and therefore that \u2018individualization is the key to success\u2019; while Sloan and\ncolleagues address flexibility in the context of the application of accessibility guide-\nlines and argue that checklists are not sufficient: \nThis approach acknowledges arguments that, given the varying nature of accessibility\nrequirements amongst individuals with specific impairment or combination of impair-\nments, combined with the unique aims and context of an online resource\u2014such as audi-\nence characteristics and usage environment, a guideline-based approach is not sufficient\nto ensure the most appropriate accessibility solutions are provided.\nThe Skills for Access project described by Sloan and colleagues therefore tried to\navoid giving checklist style guidelines in order to encourage designers and developers\nto thinking more widely about accessibility issues. This caused discomfort for some\nusers, however, who expressed a preference for \u2018short check-list style information\u2019.\nSteve Green and colleagues challenge us to think about the extent to which best\npractice can be captured in a single standard and in doing so develop an argument for\nadaptability: \nThere is a new recognition that addressing all issues of accessibility, multiculturalism and\nlanguage in a single standard could never be realised: one group or other would inevitably\nbe excluded. However, we argue that the idea that resources should be adaptable (and\nadapted) to the needs of individuals or groups is eminently sensible.\nMany of those arguing for a flexible, adaptable approach to accessibility position\nthemselves as arguing against approaches to universal design (as described by Sheryl\n4 Editorial\nBurgstahler). This is because central to the universal design approach is a commit-\nment to the principle that products should not have to be modified or adapted. They\nshould be accessible through easily imposed modifications that are available \u2018right out\nof the box\u2019 (Jacko & Hanson, 2002, p. 1). While some purists argue that universal\ndesign is about designing for everyone, the majority of proponents agree that design-\ning for the majority of people is a more realistic approach (Bohman, 2003; Witt &\nMcDermott, 2004). For example, Vanderheiden argues that: \nThere are NO universal designs; there are NO universally designed products. Universal\ndesign is a process, which yields products (devices, environments, systems, and processes),\nwhich are usable by and useful to the widest possible range of people. It is not possible,\nhowever, to create a product, which is usable by everyone or under all circumstances.\n(1996)\nIt would therefore appear reasonable to assume that adaptable design approaches can\nlive alongside universal design approaches.\nThe contributors also have slightly different perspectives on how best practice\nmight be proactive. For Wald, Automatic Speech Recognition enables academic staff\nto take a proactive rather than a reactive approach to teaching students with disabili-\nties by providing practical, economic methods to make their teaching accessible and\nassist learners to manage and search online digital multimedia resources. Sloan and\ncolleagues argue that the holistic approach is proactive in that it enables educators to\nanticipate student needs. Burgstahler, meanwhile, argues that: \nBeing both proactive (by applying universal design principles) and reactive (by providing\naccommodations) in offering courses results in more inclusive programs and minimizes the\nneed for accommodations for specific students.\nBest practice is holistic\nThe arguments presented in Phipps and Kelly\u2019s model of a holistic approach to acces-\nsible e-learning are reflected by many of the contributors in this issue. For example,\nSloan and colleagues argue for a holistic approach that ensures the accessibility solu-\ntions chosen are appropriate for the context in which the resource will be used. Several\nof the contributors concur with Phipps and Kelly that approaches to addressing acces-\nsibility should not focus solely on technical issues but should focus also on learning\nissues. For example, Draffan and Rainger argue that in order ensure inclusive and\naccessible learning experiences, the full spectrum of learner characteristics must be\ntaken into account. Martyn Cooper argues for the fundamental importance of learning\nobjectives in establishing accessibility criteria and in identifying and making adjust-\nments to online course components to meet the needs of disabled students: \nSo often in accessibility considerations of educational web sites or software, the focus is on\nhow best to make a particular element technically accessible to disabled students. However,\nthe author maintains that educators need to stand back from these considerations and\nremember that fundamentally what we are seeking to make accessible is the learning. This\nmay seem an obvious statement, but it is often missed, and is key to deciding what is the\nmost appropriate response to meet the needs of disabled students. Thus, fundamental to\nEditorial 5\naccessibility considerations in online education is having clearly established learning objec-\ntives.\nWhile the contributors challenge us to think about \u2018best practice\u2019, there are some\nresearchers who argue that focusing solely on \u2018best practice\u2019 is not helpful. For exam-\nple, Konur (2000) argues that in order to end discrimination we need to develop an\n\u2018evidence-based\u2019 model rather than a \u2018good practice\u2019 model. By this, Konur means\nthat we should move away from just focusing on positive outcomes of disability initi-\natives (good practice culture) and towards recording everything that is happening,\nparticularly the bad practice (evidence-based culture). Formal, publicly available\nevidence of bad-practice in relation to e-learning accessibility is virtually non-existent\nhowever. Although there are a number of studies that have evaluated the accessibility\nof university main websites, there is very little evaluative data regarding the student\nexperience of e-learning in its most broadest sense (beyond access to websites and\nVirtual Learning Environments). A small amount of unevaluated evidence exists on\nlearning and teaching project websites specialist mailing lists and in the occasional\nnews reports (for example, Parkin, 2001; Tierney, 2002). This perhaps presents an\nadditional challenge to disability and accessibility researchers and practitioners.\nConceptions of responsibility\nIn describing current and future practice, the contributors challenge us to think about\nresponsibility for accessibility in terms of: \n\u25cf Where in the design process accessibility should be addressed?\n\u25cf Who should take responsibility: individuals or institutions?\n\u25cf Whether responsibility should be predominantly shouldered by specialists or\nexperts (at an individual or service level) or shared amongst all.\nIn considering where in the design process accessibility should be addressed Sloan\nand colleagues argue that those who commission multimedia are responsible for\nincluding accessibility in the design specification: \nThe most appropriate and effective place to author and combine accessibility features is at\nthe point of production, but the provision of accessibility features is not commonly consid-\nered a standard part of media production, and may require a specific request at the time\nof commissioning.\nCooper and Burgstahler address responsibility at an institutional or programme\nlevel, and in doing so consider the roles of individuals within the institution or\nprogramme. Cooper describes how the Open University in the United Kingdom has\naddressed accessibility issues and how responsibility is divided and shared between\ndifferent teams\/sections of the institution. Burgstahler describes how she and her\ncolleagues have attempted to evaluate the extent to which distance learning\nprogrammes in the United States are taking responsibility for accessibility. She\nreports some difficulties in identifying exactly which staff had a responsibility for\naccessibility: \n6 Editorial\nSometimes, several distance learning staff members were consulted before the correct\nperson who could make specific programmatic changes was consulted and this person was\nnot the same for each Indicator.\nUncertainty about roles and responsibilities coupled with a lack of clear leadership\ncan slow down the time it takes for staff to \u2018buy in\u2019 to accessibility and change their\npractices.\nCooper also highlights the importance of not devolving primary responsibility to\nspecialist units (e.g. disability advisors); rather, the responsibility of specialist units is\nto support the work of others (e.g. course teams). There is a growing recognition that\nsuch an approach is more inclusive and less likely to lead to students with disabilities\nbeing seen as a \u2018special\u2019 group that need to be dealt with by special isolated, or segre-\ngated services (Edwards, 2000; Shaw, 2003; Tinklin et al., 2004). Seale (2006) argues\nthat adopting a model whereby specialist disability staff are encouraged to support\nother staff in the institution could pave the way for important strategic partnerships\nto develop. For example: \n\u25cf lecturers can liaise with assistive technologists and disability officers regarding the\nkinds of e-learning experiences that they are offering in their courses, so that assis-\ntive technologists and disability officers can make more informed reccomendations\nto students about the kind of support and specialist technologies they will require\nin order to engage with the e-learning on offer; and\n\u25cf disability officers can be involved in embedding accessibility policies and practices\ninto the wider community, and ensuring that disability is integrated into an\ninstitution\u2019s planning and funding programme.\nConclusions\nThe different conceptions offered by the contributors to this issue are extremely\nuseful in that they prompt us to think about barriers to learning for students with\ndisability (e.g. rigid application of guidelines) and explore how changes or adapta-\ntions to cultures, policies or approaches might reduce these barriers. Such exploration\nmay help to structure future discussion and debate regarding disability, technology\nand accessibility in higher education.\nReferences\nAbascal, J., Arrue, M., Fajardo, I., Garay, N. & Tomas, J.
