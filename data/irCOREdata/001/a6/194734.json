Yeoman1\nReceived 21 September 2004; revised 16 November 2004; accepted 3 December 2004; published 4 February 2005.\n[1] The first extended series of observations of Saturn\u2019s auroral emissions, undertaken by\nthe Hubble Space Telescope in January 2004 in conjunction with measurements of the\nupstream solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) by the Cassini spacecraft,\nhave revealed a strong auroral response to the interplanetary medium. Following the arrival\nof the forward shock of a corotating interaction region compression, bright auroras were\nfirst observed to expand significantly poleward in the dawn sector such that the area of the\npolar cap was much reduced, following which the auroral morphology evolved\ninto a spiral structure around the pole. We propose that these auroral effects are produced by\ncompression-induced reconnection of a significant fraction of the open flux present in\nSaturn\u2019s open tail lobes, as has also been observed to occur at Earth, followed by\nsubcorotation of the newly closed flux tubes in the outer magnetosphere region due to the\naction of the ionospheric torque. We show that the combined action of reconnection and\nrotation naturally gives rise to spiral structures on newly opened and newly closed field\nlines, the latter being in the same sense as observed in the auroral images. The\nmagnetospheric corollary of the dynamic scenario outlined here is that corotating\ninteraction region-induced magnetospheric compressions and tail collapses should be\naccompanied by hot plasma injection into the outer magnetosphere, first in the midnight\nand dawn sector, and second at increasing local times via noon and dusk. We discuss\nhow this scenario leads to a strong correlation of auroral and related disturbances at Saturn\nwith the dynamic pressure of the solar wind, rather than to a correlation with the north-\nsouth component of the IMF as observed at Earth, even though the underlying physics is\nsimilar, related to the transport of magnetic flux to and from the tail in the Dungey cycle.\nCitation: Cowley, S.

Introduction\n[2] Although the Saturn flybys by the Pioneer 11 and\nVoyager 1 and 2 spacecraft in the interval 1979\u20131981\nprovided much information about the large-scale structure\nof the magnetic field and plasma populations in Saturn\u2019s\nmagnetosphere [e.g., Smith et al., 1980; Ness et al., 1981,\n1982; Behannon et al., 1983; Sittler et al., 1983; Richardson,\n1986; Richardson and Sittler, 1990], relatively little infor-\nmation has been available until recently concerning the\ndynamics of the magnetosphere and the nature of its inter-\naction with the interplanetary medium. Voyager observations\nshowed that the power of Saturn kilometric radiation (SKR)\nemission is strongly positively correlated with the dynamic\npressure of the solar wind [Desch, 1982; Desch and Rucker,\n1983], though the physical mechanism underlying the\ncorrelation has remained unclear. SKR is believed to be\ngenerated by the accelerated electron beams associated with\nSaturn\u2019s polar auroras [e.g., Lecacheux and Genova, 1983;\nGalopeau et al., 1995], thus implying a related interplan-\netary modulation of electron precipitation and auroral\nemission. A number of individual high-resolution images\nof Saturn\u2019s UV auroras obtained by the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) over past years have indeed shown a\nhighly variable auroral morphology [Ge\u00b4rard et al., 1995,\n2004; Trauger et al., 1998; Cowley et al., 2004a], but in the\nabsence of upstream data it has not been possible to relate\nthese to concurrent interplanetary conditions. Recently,\nhowever, Prange\u00b4 et al. [2004] have discussed a HST image\nshowing a polar auroral disturbance that they infer was\ntriggered by the passage of an interplanetary shock associ-\nated with a coronal mass ejection (CME), tracked from the\nSun via Earth and Jupiter.\n[3] With the approach of the Cassini spacecraft to Saturn\nprior to its insertion into orbit on 1 July 2004 the opportu-\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 110, A02201, doi:10.1029\/2004JA010796, 2005\n1Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\n2Center for Space Physics, Department of Astronomy, Boston\nUniversity, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.\n3Institut d\u2019Astrophysique et de Ge\u00b4ophysique, Universite\u00b4 de Lie`ge,\nLie`ge, Belgium.\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/05\/2004JA010796\nA02201 1 of 19\nnity was taken during the interval 8\u201330 January 2004 to\nobtain a sequence of images of Saturn\u2019s auroras using the\nHST, in conjunction with upstream Cassini measurements\nof the interplanetary medium and SKR emissions. Initial\nresults have demonstrated that both UV auroras and SKR\nemissions respond strongly to the shock compressions that\nare associated with interplanetary corotating interaction\nregions (CIRs) [Clarke et al., 2005; Crary et al., 2005;\nKurth et al., 2005]. In this paper we discuss the implications\nof these observations and suggest a qualitative interpretive\nscenario based on reconnection dynamics in a rotation-\ndominated magnetosphere. This scenario should form the\nbasis of future more quantitative evaluations. We begin in\nsection 2 by providing an overview of the joint Cassini-HST\nobservations which form the basis for the theoretical dis-\ncussion which follows.\n2. Observations of CIR-Related Auroral Activity\nat Saturn\n[4] A summary of the observations to be discussed here is\nshown in Figure 1. Figures 1a\u20131d show four HST Space\nTelescope Imaging Spectrograph UV frames of the auroras\nin Saturn\u2019s southern polar region, which was tilted toward\nthe Sun (and Earth) during the epoch of these observations.\nThe images in Figures 1a\u20131d were obtained on 24, 26, 28,\nand 30 January 2004, respectively. These frames have been\ngenerated by combining individual images obtained on a\ngiven HST orbit in the red-green-blue color system. For\neach date the frame includes clear images (blue), F25SRF2\nfiltered images (red), and the mean of all images (green),\nwith a total exposure time of \u000150 min (the center times of\nthese intervals are given in Figure 1 caption). This leads to\nnearly 30\u0001 of rotational blurring for any feature that rigidly\ncorotates with the planet but distinguishes auroral emissions\nfrom reflected sunlight from the disc and rings by their blue\nand red colors. Each frame shows a log stretch in intensity,\nidentical for each day, with the upper threshold set to a\nvalue \u000120 kR to emphasize the faint emissions.\n[5] Figure 1e shows the interplanetary magnetic field\n(IMF) strength observed by Cassini over the relevant interval\n(24\u201330 January), together with the estimated reconnection\nvoltage (open flux production rate) at Saturn\u2019s dayside\nmagnetopause, derived using the algorithm of Jackman et\nal. [2004]. This voltage is taken to be given by\nF \u00bc VSWB?Lo cos4 q=2\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere VSW is the radial speed of the solar wind, B? is the\nstrength of the IMF component perpendicular to the radial\nflow, Lo is a scale length taken equal to 10 Saturn radii (RS =\n60330 km) by analogy with Earth, and q is the clock angle\nof the IMF relative to Saturn\u2019s northern magnetic axis.\nDetails of the plasma and field measurements employed are\ngiven by Crary et al. [2005], while the reader is referred to\nJackman et al. [2004] for further discussion of the origins of\nthe formula. According to equation (1), large dayside\nreconnection voltages are favored for northward pointing\nIMF at Saturn, opposite to the case for Earth due to the\nopposite sense of the planetary field. During the interval\nshown in Figure 1 the spacecraft was located \u00010.2 AU\nupstream of Saturn in the radial direction and was also\ndisplaced from the planet-Sun line by \u00010.5 AU toward\ndawn. With a nominal solar wind speed of \u0001500 km s\u00061 the\nradial propagation delay from the spacecraft to the planet\nwas thus \u000117 hours. Using this nominal delay, the timing of\nthe HST images relative to the interplanetary data is shown\nin Figure 1e by the vertical dashed lines. We note, however,\nthat the relative timing is unavoidably uncertain to within\nseveral hours, due particularly to nonradial propagation\neffects and the separation of the spacecraft and planet in\nheliographic longitude [Crary et al., 2005].\n[6] The sizable displacement between the spacecraft and\nplanet during the interval also means that the plasma and\nfield properties measured by Cassini may not be indicative\nin detail of those that impinged on the planet, but they\nshould certainly be representative of the overall properties\nand behavior. In particular, heliosphere-scale structures such\nas CIRs which are observed by Cassini will certainly\nimpinge on the planet with an appropriate (but somewhat\nuncertain) delay. CIR structures are formed by the inter-\nactions of solar wind plasmas of differing speed that are\nemitted by the rotating Sun into a given radial direction,\nwith slow wind originating from the region surrounding the\nsolar magnetic dipole equator and fast wind from the\ncoronal holes surrounding the magnetic poles [e.g., Gosling\nand Pizzo, 1999]. Fast wind following slow into a given\ndirection forms a compression region, while slow wind\nfollowing fast forms a rarefaction. The interval considered\nhere corresponds to the declining phase of the solar cycle,\nduring which the effective solar magnetic dipole had a\nsignificant tilt with respect to the solar spin axis. This\nconfiguration leads to a consistent structure in the near-\nequatorial heliosphere consisting of two compression\nregions per solar rotation, separated by two rarefactions.\nThis recurrent CIR pattern sweeps around with the rotating\nSun over both spacecraft and planet and was observed by\nCassini over many solar rotations surrounding the interval\nof interest here [Jackman et al., 2004].\n[7] The field data in Figure 1 show that at the beginning of\nthe interval the IMF strength was relatively low at a few\ntenths of a nanotesla, as had continuously been the case for\nseveral days previously, corresponding to a CIR rarefaction\nregion. The estimated dayside reconnection voltages are\ntherefore also low, varying from small values to peaks of\nseveral tens of kilovolts. The HST image obtained at the end\nof 24 January (Figure 1a) relates to these conditions and\nshows a \u2018\u2018quiet\u2019\u2019 but relatively expanded auroral oval that\nhad also remained of similar form for several days previously\n[Clarke et al., 2005]. The previous CIR compression had\nbeen observed by Cassini during the interval 15\u201317 January,\nfollowing which the auroral oval had increased modestly in\nsize to that seen in Figure 1a. A sudden increase in field\nstrength then occurred at the spacecraft at \u00011600 UT on\n25 January, indicative of the arrival of the forward shock of a\nCIR compression region (indicated by the vertical arrow\nmarked \u2018\u2018S\u2019\u2019 in the figure). Simple radial modeling indicates\nthat the shock arrived at Saturn at \u00010800 UT on 26 January\nafter a delay of \u000116 hours [Crary et al., 2005], a timing\nwhich does not differ significantly from the nominal\n\u000117 hours used here in Figure 1. It is thus estimated that\nthe shock arrived \u000130 hours after Figure 1a and \u000110 hours\nprior to Figure 1b, which was obtained at \u00011900 UT on\n26 January. Figure 1b shows that major auroral dynamics\nA02201 COWLEY ET AL.: SATURN\u2019S AURORAL DYNAMICS\n2 of 19\nA02201\nwere then in progress, with the dawn sector of the oval\nessentially filled with bright UV emissions. SKR emissions\nshow a corresponding enhancement [Kurth et al., 2005],\nwhich was observed at Cassini beginning at\u00011200 UTon 26\nJanuary (W. S. Kurth, personal communication, 2004), an\ninterval of \u00017 hours prior to the corresponding HST image.\nAfter the passage of the shock the IMF strength at the\nspacecraft increased stepwise over the next day, peaking at\n\u00012 nT, before falling more gradually over the next \u00015 days.\nThe solar wind density behaved correspondingly, while the\nwind speed varied modestly between\u0001550 and\u0001600 km s\u00061\n[Crary et al., 2005]. The estimated dayside reconnection\nvoltage in Figure 1 shows behavior related principally to\nthe IMF strength, though also characteristically strongly\nmodulated on shorter, few-hour timescales by variations in\nthe field direction, between small values when the field\npointed south to peaks of \u0001400 kV when it pointed north\n[Jackman et al., 2004]. The HST image obtained at\nFigure 1. Overview of Saturn\u2019s auroral dynamics and their relation to CIR compression regions as\nobserved during the Cassini-HST campaign in January 2004. At the top of the figure we show four frames\nof Saturn\u2019s UV auroras in the southern polar region obtained by the HST as follows: (a) 2351 UT on 24\nJanuary, (b) 1903 UT on 26 January, (c) 0128 UT on 28 January, and (d) 1902 UT on 30 January. Clear\nand filtered images from a given HST orbit have been combined in the red-green-blue color system as\nindicated in section 1, the total integration time in each frame being \u000150 min. Times given are the\napproximate midtimes of the imaging intervals involved. Noon-midnight meridian is near the center of\neach frame with noon toward the top, dawn to the left, and dusk to the right. (e) Strength of the IMF\nmeasured upstream of Saturn by the Cassini spacecraft and an estimate of the dayside reconnection\nvoltage (open flux production rate) obtained from equation (1) [after Jackman et al., 2004]. Interval\nshown is 24\u201330 January inclusive. Vertical dashed lines marked a\u2013d indicate the approximate\ncorresponding times of the auroral images using a nominal 17 hour lag between Cassini and Saturn,\nthough these timings are uncertain to within several hours due to possible nonradial propagation effects in\nthe solar wind and the separation of the spacecraft and the planet in heliographic longitude. Vertical arrow\nmarked \u2018\u2018S\u2019\u2019 indicates the arrival of the forward shock of a CIR compression region at the spacecraft, at\n\u00011600 UT on 25 January. HST images are after Clarke et al. [2005], and the interplanetary data are from\nCrary et al. [2005].\nA02201 COWLEY ET AL.: SATURN\u2019S AURORAL DYNAMICS\n3 of 19\nA02201\n\u00010100 UT on 28 January (Figure 1c) then corresponds to\nan interval \u000140 hours after the arrival of the shock, some\nhours after the peak fields had arrived at the planet, during\nan interval of \u0001100\u2013200 kV estimated dayside driving. It\nshows a pronounced \u2018\u2018spiral\u2019\u2019 auroral pattern, with strongest\nemissions in the dawn sector [Clarke et al., 2005]. The\ncentral \u2018\u2018polar cap\u2019\u2019 region of low emission had regained an\napproximately circular shape but was considerably con-\ntracted in size relative to Figure 1a. Figure 1d, obtained at\n\u00011900 UT on 30 January, corresponds to an interval late in\nthe declining phase of the event\u0001110 hours (\u00014.5 days) after\nthe arrival of the shock, as the field strengths and dayside\nvoltages approached initial values. Here the near-continuous\nauroral oval had essentially reformed with a central dark\npolar region expanded compared with Figure 1c, though still\nsomewhat smaller than in Figure 1a, and with considerable\nbrightness variations particularly in the dawn sector. With\nregard to relationships with other observations, we note that\nspiral auroral forms akin to that seen in Figure 1c but of\nlesser intensity have been reported in earlier HST images by\nGe\u00b4rard et al. [2004] and are also observed in a number of\nother images obtained during the January HST campaign\n[Clarke et al., 2005]. Auroral spirals, winding consistently\nwith increasing local time to lower latitudes, thus appear to\nbe a common morphology at Saturn. We also note that the\n\u2018\u2018disturbed\u2019\u2019 HST image presented by Prange\u00b4 et al. [2004]\nappears to have some affinities with Figure 1b, though the\narea of the prenoon polar auroral enhancement is much more\nfully developed in the case shown here.\n[8] It seems reasonable to propose that the auroral varia-\ntions observed in Figure 1 are those which relate to the\nSKR-dynamic pressure correlation found previously by\nDesch [1982] and Desch and Rucker [1983] using Voyager\ndata, thus providing clues to the origin of this primary\ninterplanetary-modulation effect of Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere.\nHere we suggest that these effects are connected with\nreconnection dynamics in a rotating magnetosphere, as we\nnow go on to discuss.\n3. Reconnection Dynamics in a Rotating\nMagnetosphere: Paradigm Cases\n3.1. Steady Balanced Reconnection\n[9] The starting point for this discussion is the steady\nstate picture of the large-scale field and flow in Saturn\u2019s\ncoupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system presented by\nCowley et al. [2004a], illustrated here in Figures 2a\u20132b.\nFigure 2a shows the flow in the magnetospheric equatorial\nplane, extending to the magnetopause, at \u000120 RS in the\nsubsolar region (bottom of the diagram). Three basic\nregions are shown. In the inner region the plasma rotates\nin the same sense as the planet, with an angular velocity that\nfalls from near-rigid corotation in the inner region\n(\u000110.6 hour period) to \u000150\u201360% of rigid corotation in\nthe outer part of the middle magnetosphere, as indicated by\nVoyager observations [Richardson, 1986, 1995]. The sub-\ncorotation of the plasma is believed to be due to particle\npickup from internal sources, combined with radial trans-\nport [Saur et al., 2004]. Surrounding this is a layer where\nthe planetary plasma is lost down the dusk flank of the tail\nby plasmoid formation and field line pinch-off, as first\ndiscussed in the Jovian context by Vasyliunas [1983] (the\n\u2018\u2018Vasyliunas cycle\u2019\u2019). The Vasyliunas cycle reconnection\nline is shown by the dashed line marked with crosses, while\nthe dot-dashed line marked \u2018\u2018P\u2019\u2019 and the dashed streamline\nmarked \u2018\u2018O\u2019\u2019 show the locations of the outer boundary of the\nplasmoid and its central O line, respectively. On the dawn\nside of the outer magnetosphere we then have the sunward\ndirected \u2018\u2018return\u2019\u2019 flows of closed flux tubes from the tail\nassociated with the reconnection interaction with the inter-\nplanetary medium, first discussed in the terrestrial context\nby Dungey [1961] (the \u2018\u2018Dungey cycle\u2019\u2019). These flows are\ninitiated by open flux production at the dayside magneto-\npause, quantified by equation (1), following which the open\nfield lines are stretched downstream by the solar wind flow to\nform the tail lobes, from which flux eventually returns by\nreconnection closure and sunward flow as depicted in\nFigure 2a. The corresponding reconnection regions on the\nmagnetopause and in the tail are shown in the figure by the\nsolid linesmarked with crosses. The plasma flows in the outer\ndayside region correspond to angular velocities which are\n\u000150\u201380% of rigid corotation [Richardson, 1986, 1995].\n[10] Figure 2b then shows the corresponding flows and\nfield-aligned currents in the polar ionosphere, looking down\nonto the northern pole with the direction of Sun again at the\nbottom of the diagram. Upward and downward directed\ncurrents are shown by the circled dots and crosses, respec-\ntively. The outer boundary of the diagram corresponds to a\ncolatitude of \u000130\u0001, mapping to \u00013 RS in the equatorial\nplane, while the region of open flux, which could not be\ndepicted equatorially in Figure 2a, occupies the central\nregion, to \u000115\u0001 colatitude. The amount of open flux\ncontained within this region is \u000130\u201340 GWb. The flows\nwithin this region consist of the sum of an antisunward flow\nassociated with Dungey cycle transport in the tail lobes\ncombined with subcorotation with the planet driven by ion-\nneutral collisions in the ionosphere, which twists the tail\nlobes [Isbell et al., 1984]. Recent infrared Doppler obser-\nvations obtained by Stallard et al. [2004] suggest angular\nvelocities of \u000130% of rigid corotation in this region, such\nthat the corresponding flows, of \u0001800 m s\u00061 at the polar\ncap boundary, are usually considerably in excess of the\n\u000120\u2013200 m s\u00061 flows associated with the Dungey cycle\n[Jackman et al., 2004]. The sudden increase in flow speed\nacross the open-closed field line boundary from \u000130% of\nrigid corotation on open field lines to \u000150\u201380% of rigid\ncorotation on outer closed field lines (as indicated above),\nimplies a sudden reduction in the equatorward directed\nionospheric Pedersen current, and hence an upward directed\nfield-aligned current at the boundary, indicated in Figure 2b\nby circled dots. Cowley et al. [2004a] showed that for\nplausible parameters these currents require the downward\nacceleration of magnetospheric electrons into the iono-\nsphere, thus producing a ring of \u2018\u2018discrete\u2019\u2019 UV emission\naround the boundary, which they suggested corresponds to\nthe main auroral oval (e.g., Figure 1a). A simplified\n(axisymmetric) quantitative model has been presented by\nCowley et al. [2004b]. When the Dungey cycle is active,\nhowever, the associated flows enhance the boundary cur-\nrents and hence auroras at dawn relative to dusk. In addition\nto these discrete auroras associated with field-aligned cur-\nrents at the open-closed field line boundary, \u2018\u2018diffuse\u2019\u2019\nemissions produced by hot plasma precipitation from the\nouter magnetosphere may be expected to extend equator-\nA02201 COWLEY ET AL.: SATURN\u2019S AURORAL DYNAMICS\n4 of 19\nA02201\nward of the boundary at all local times (see, e.g.,\nsection 3.2). In particular, we may expect precipitation\nfrom the hot plasmas formed in the nightside reconnection\nprocesses associated with the Dungey and Vasyliunas cycles,\nwhich should occur downstream from their respective\nmapped reconnection lines (\u2018\u2018X lines\u2019\u2019 in Figures 2a\u20132b).\nAccording to Figure 2b this precipitation should therefore\nalso favor the dawn side of the polar ionosphere. In partic-\nular, precipitation of hot plasma resulting from tail recon-\nnection in the Dungey cycle should occur on a layer of\nstreamlines passing from the mapped tail to the mapped\nmagnetopause reconnection regions via dawn as shown. In\nthis steady state picture, therefore, both discrete and diffuse\nemissions should be enhanced at dawn compared with dusk\nwhen the Dungey cycle is active.\n3.2. Reconnection Pulses\n[11] The situation depicted in Figures 2a\u20132b relates to\nan interval of steady significant magnetospheric driving by\nthe Dungey cycle, involving equal rates of open flux\nproduction at the dayside magnetopause and destruction\nin the tail. However, it is clear from the results presented\nby Jackman et al. [2004] and those shown in Figure 1 that\nthe magnetopause rate is characteristically variable on both\nlong timescales (days) due to field strength variations in\nCIR structures and on shorter timescales (tens of minutes to\nhours) due to north-south field fluctuations. In addition, the\nauroral data in Figure 1 suggest the occurrence of intervals\nof impulsive flux closure in the tail, associated with sudden\ncontractions of the polar cap, as will be discussed further in\nsection 4. Here, therefore, we broaden the above consid-\nerations to include discussion of the effect of variable\nreconnection rates at the magnetopause and in the tail,\nand of intervals of unbalanced dayside and nightside\nreconnection. Here we begin by consideration of the con-\nsequences of brief pulses of reconnection, lasting for\nintervals much shorter than the planetary rotation period.\nThis topic has been discussed previously in the terrestrial\ncontext by Cowley and Lockwood [1992] and is now\napplied here to Saturn. For the case of the Earth the effects\nof planetary rotation were ignored in the discussion, since\ncorotational effects are expected to be small outside of the\nsmall central \u2018\u2018core\u2019\u2019 of dipolar flux tubes corresponding to\nthe plasmasphere. As we have seen above, however, plasma\nrotation with the planet, driven by ion-neutral coupling in\nthe ionosphere, is a major feature at Saturn, both on closed\nFigure 2a.

Here we therefore consider the\ntransport and assimilation of newly reconnected field lines\nin the presence of such rotational flows.\n[12] We begin in Figure 3 by considering the motion of a\nsmall region of newly closed field lines created by a burst of\nreconnection in the tail. The diagrams show a cut through\nthe equatorial plane as in Figure 2a, where the outer solid\nline is the magnetopause, and the solid line across the\nnightside tail represents schematically the outer limit of\nclosed field lines. Plasma streamlines are indicated by the\ndashed lines with arrows. In Figure 3a a short burst of tail\nreconnection has closed a small region of open flux in the\ntail, causing the nightside boundary of closed field lines to\nbulge outwards. The newly closed flux is indicated in\nFigure 3 by the stippling, with an inner boundary indicated\nby the short-dashed line. It is shown to be located on the\ndawn side of the tail due to the possible presence of\nVasyliunas cycle outflow at dusk, as in Figure 2a, though\nfor simplicity the latter has not been represented here. We\ncomment on this further below. Initially the field line\ntension in the newly closed flux tubes causes them to\ncontract toward the planet, while the ionospheric torque\nimparts a rotation toward dawn. Simple estimates based on\nthe analyses of Vasyliunas [1994] and Cowley and Bunce\n[2003] suggest that plausible timescales for the impartation\nof planetary rotation are \u00011 hour. After a few hours,\ntherefore, the region of newly closed flux rotates into the\ndawn boundary of the tail, where it may cause the magne-\ntopause to bulge outwards, as shown in Figure 3b. Solar\nwind compression resists this outward motion, however,\nand enforces assimilation of the newly closed flux tubes into\nthe outer region of subcorotating magnetospheric flow. The\ntubes thus continue to rotate around in the outer magneto-\nsphere as shown in Figures 3c and 3d, where the difference\nin flux tube cross section depicted reflects schematically the\ndifference in equatorial field strength between the dayside\nand nightside outer magnetospheres due to the solar wind\nflow asymmetry. The overall transport time for a full\nrotation from Figure 3a to Figure 3d is rather uncertain,\nwith plasma angular velocities which are likely to be higher\non the dayside than on the nightside. However, the obser-\nvations cited in section 3.1 suggest that an overall figure of\nFigure 2b.

Circled dots and crosses indicate regions of upward\nand downward field-aligned current, respectively, as indicated by the divergence of the horizontal\nionospheric current. Pedersen currents flow generally equatorward and close in the field-aligned current\nsystem shown, while Hall currents flow generally anticlockwise around the pole and close in the\nionosphere.

[2004a].)\nA02201 COWLEY ET AL.: SATURN\u2019S AURORAL DYNAMICS\n6 of 19\nA02201\n\u000150% of rigid corotation may not be unreasonable, such\nthat the timescale depicted from Figure 3a to Figure 3d is\nroughly 20 hours. Ultimately, of course, the patch of new\nclosed flux loses its specific identity, becoming part of the\nouter magnetosphere region of closed field lines carrying\nhot plasma from the tail (together possibly with outwardly\ndiffused cool planetary plasma after some time), all of\nwhich have similar histories.\n[13] In Figure 4 we show the corresponding patterns of\nflow and precipitation in the northern ionosphere, in a\nsimilar format to Figure 2b. In Figure 4a the newly\nreconnected flux tubes form a \u2018\u2018bulge\u2019\u2019 of closed flux\nprotruding into the polar cap region of open field lines\n(again shown stippled), on which we expect hot plasma to\nprecipitate following heating in the reconnection process in\nthe tail. Such bulges may occur preferentially on the dawn\nside of midnight as shown due to the presence of Vasyliunas\ncycle outflow at dusk, though for simplicity the latter is\nagain not specifically represented here. The hot plasma\nprecipitation may enhance the ionospheric conductivity\nwithin the bulge, leading to enhanced boundary currents\nand auroras as indicated. The ionospheric flow is not\nstrongly perturbed, however, since at this very early stage\nthe field line motions in the tail are largely inductive and do\nnot map directly to the ionosphere. In Figure 4b the\nassimilation process is in progress, resulting in the elimina-\ntion of the bulge and a return to a more circular boundary\nshape, but with a smaller radius than before the reconnec-\ntion burst. The assimilation is associated with the excitation\nof a twin-vortex flow, added to the rotational flow as shown,\nFigure 3.

Outer solid line is the magnetopause with the\ndirection to the Sun at the bottom of the diagram, dawn is to the left, and dusk is to the right, as in\nFigure 2a. Solid horizontal line across the tail shows schematically the outer limit of closed field lines.\nStreamlines are shown by the dashed lines with arrows. Patch of newly closed flux is indicated by the\nstippled area, bounded on its inner side by the short-dashed line.\nA02201 COWLEY ET AL.: SATURN\u2019S AURORAL DYNAMICS\n7 of 19\nA02201\nin which the plasma motion at the open-closed field line\nboundary is directed equatorward in the vicinity of the bulge\nand poleward elsewhere, associated with the contraction of\nthe boundary. In the absence of continuing reconnection, as\nassumed here, these boundary motions are adiaroic; that is,\nthe boundary moves exactly with the convecting plasma.\nThe twin-vortex flow is also associated with a \u2018\u2018substorm\nwedge-like\u2019\u2019 current system (though of opposite polarity to\nthe case of the Earth due to the opposite planetary field\npolarity), in which upward and downward field-aligned\ncurrents flow in the two vortices at either end of the bulge,\nbeing closed in the ionosphere via eastward directed\nPedersen currents within the bulge. The upward current\nregion is likely to be associated with enhanced electron\nprecipitation and consequent auroral emission akin to the\n\u2018\u2018westward traveling surge\u2019\u2019 at Earth, though here it is\nlocated at the eastern end of the auroral bulge. After\nassimilation into the closed flux region has taken place,\nthe new patch of closed flux continues to rotate around the\nboundary as shown in Figures 4c and 4d, while precipitation\nof hot plasma into the ionosphere declines toward the\nbackground level of diffuse precipitation from the outer\nmagnetosphere. The auroral emissions resulting from this\nprecipitation will be located immediately equatorward of the\nring of discrete auroras produced by upward directed field-\naligned currents at the open-closed field line boundary, as\nFigure 4. (a\u2013d) Sketches in the ionosphere corresponding to Figure 3, showing the motion of a patch of\nnewly closed field lines formed by a burst of reconnection in the tail. Direction toward the Sun is at the\nbottom of each diagram, with dawn to the left and dusk to the right, as in Figure 2b. As in Figure 3, the\nsolid line shows the boundary between open and closed field lines, while the dashed lines with arrows\nshow plasma streamlines. Patch of newly closed flux is again indicated by the stippled area, bounded on\nits equatorward side by the short-dashed line. Circled dots and crosses indicate regions of upward and\ndownward field-aligned currents, respectively.\nA02201 COWLEY ET AL.: SATURN\u2019S AURORAL DYNAMICS\n8 of 19\nA02201\ndescribed in section 3.1, and will give rise to subcorotating\npatches of diffuse emission in this region.\n[14] The above discussion assumed for simplicity that the\nregion of newly closed flux is assimilated directly into the\nouter magnetosphere and subsequently subcorotates contin-\nuously in this region. If the Vasyliunas cycle is active,\nhowever, as depicted in Figures 2a\u20132b, then these flux\ntubes will not rotate directly into the nightside closed field\nregion as shown in Figures 3d and 4d, but will instead\nstretch out along the dusk flank of the tail, overlying other\noutflowing flux tubes mass-loaded with planetary plasma,\nbefore plasmoid formation and pinch-off. The effect of this\nis indicated in Figure 5a, where we show conditions in\nthe equatorial plane (corresponding to Figure 3d), while\nin Figure 5b we show conditions in the ionosphere\n(corresponding to Figure 4d). In the equatorial cut the\nstippled \u2018\u2018newly closed\u2019\u2019 tubes are flowing down the dusk\nflank of the magnetopause, and at the instant shown, straddle\nthe dot-dashed line marked P, representing the outer edge of\nthe closed-loop plasmoid. As in Figures 2a\u20132b, the O line\nof the plasmoid is indicated by the streamline marked O, and\nthe plasmoid inner edge is the solid line streamline emerging\nfrom the dawnward end of Vasyliunas cycle X line, again\nindicated by the dashed line marked with crosses. The newly\nclosed field lines at the dusk tail magnetopause which pass\nthrough the equatorial plane upstream of the plasmoid outer\nboundary P have not yet taken part in Vasyliunas cycle\nreconnection and are still connected to the planet\u2019s iono-\nsphere, overlying the developing plasmoid structure. Those\nwhich pass through the equator downstream of this line have\nso been reconnected and lie within the plasmoid. They are\nmagnetically connected to the stippled patch of flux lying\ntailward of the Vasyliunas cycle reconnection line, on the\ndawnward side of the plasmoid O line. On the planetary side\nof the X line the shortened remnants of these field lines (also\nstippled) emerge into the nightside flow and rotate around\nwith the planet in a similar manner to that shown in\nFigure 3d. The situation in the ionosphere, shown in\nFigure 5b, differs little from Figure 4d. The main distinction\nis that precipitation from the region of newly closed flux may\ndiminish significantly on the upstream side (duskward) of\nthe mapped Vasyliunas cycle reconnection line as the flux\ntube is stretched out along the dusk tail flank and may then\nintensify on the downstream (dawnward) side due to the\nheating of tail plasma in the Vasyliunas cycle reconnection\nprocess. The flux tubes may thus brighten aurorally on\npassing across the mapped X line.\n[15] We now turn to consider reconnection at the magne-\ntopause, and in Figure 6 we show the corresponding\nsituation in the ionosphere for a pulse of dayside reconnec-\ntion, in the same format as Figure 4. In Figure 6a the\nreconnected field lines form a region of newly opened flux,\nshown stippled, appended to the preexisting region of open\nflux in the noon sector. These field lines are carried by the\ncombined action of magnetic field tension and magneto-\nsheath flow into the nightside magnetosphere on a timescale\nof \u00012 hours and start to become assimilated into the tail\nlobe. Precipitation of magnetosheath \u2018\u2018cusp\u2019\u2019 plasma into\nthe ionosphere occurs on these field lines for a similar time,\nuntil switched off by the supersonic downstream flow of the\nmagnetosheath source plasma. A twin-vortex flow is again\nexcited in the ionosphere as assimilation takes place, as\nFigure 5. Sketches in the same format as Figures 3 and 4 showing the propagation of a patch of closed\nfield lines into the nightside magnetosphere when the Vasyliunas cycle is active, in the (a) equatorial\nplane and (b) ionosphere. These diagrams then replace those shown in Figures 3d and 4d, respectively.\nLabeling of the features of the Vasyliunas cycle field and flow follows that shown in Figures 2a\u20132b.\nA02201 COWLEY ET AL.: SATURN\u2019S AURORAL DYNAMICS\n9 of 19\nA02201\nshown in Figure 6b, which is such that the perturbed open-\nclosed field line boundary moves poleward in the region of\nthe bulge, and equatorward elsewhere, thus returning the\nboundary to a more circular shape with the increased\namount of open flux. The associated \u2018\u2018wedge\u2019\u2019 current\nsystem is again of opposite polarity to that in the terrestrial\nsystem. At the same time, ion-neutral frictional drag causes\nthe open tubes to subcorotate around the boundary with the\nrest of the open field lines, as also shown in Figure 6b. With\nincreasing time, the patch of newly reconnected flux thus\nsimply rotates within the outer part of the region of open\nflux, as shown in Figures 6c and 6d. This motion causes the\nopen field lines to be twisted into a spiral in the tail lobe as\nthe magnetopause \u2018\u2018end\u2019\u2019 is transported antisunward by the\nsolar wind flow [Isbell et al., 1984]. The down-tail pitch of\nthe spiral (i.e., the down-tail length of one full turn), is thus\ngiven by the distance traveled by the solar wind in the time\ntaken for the open field lines to make one complete rotation\nin the ionosphere. As indicated in section 3.1, the results of\nStallard et al. [2004] indicate angular velocities of about a\nthird of rigid corotation for this motion, such that the\noverall timescale for one complete rotation, as shown in\nFigure 6, is \u000130 hours, an interval which we note is much\nshorter than the typical \u00018 day transpolar transit time in the\nDungey cycle [Jackman et al., 2004]. With a nominal solar\nwind speed of \u0001500 km s\u00061, the down-tail pitch of the\ncorresponding field spiral in the lobe is thus \u0001900 RS. One\nimplication of the spiral structure of the lobe field is that\nreconnection events occurring in the center of the tail\nwhere the two lobes meet will map magnetically in the\nionosphere to later local times. For example, a reconnection\nevent occurring in the tail on the midnight meridian at a\nradial distance of \u0001225 RS (one quarter of the above spiral\npitch) will map to the ionosphere at dawn. Here, however,\nFigure 6. (a\u2013d) Sketches in the ionosphere showing the motion of a patch of newly opened field lines\nformed by a burst of reconnection at the dayside magnetopause. Format is the same as Figure 4, with the\ndirection toward the Sun at the bottom of each diagram, with dawn to the left and dusk to the right.\nA02201 COWLEY ET AL.: SATURN\u2019S AURORAL DYNAMICS\n10 of 19\nA02201\nwe will assume that tail reconnection events typically\noccur rather closer to the planet than this, as seems\nplausible by analogy with Earth. In this case the local time\ndisplacements between the tail center and ionosphere will\nbe modest, as effectively assumed in the discussion of\nFigure 4.\n[16] The rotational motion of the open flux has interesting\nconsequences for the structure and dynamics of the tail. In\nthe nonrotating case discussed in the terrestrial context by\nCowley et al. [1991], sequential pulses of dayside recon-\nnection cause the open flux to become layered in time\nsequence inside the open-closed field line boundary. Re-\nconnection events on the nightside then cause the open flux\nto be removed essentially in the same order. In a rotating\ntail, however, nightside reconnection events will preferen-\ntially remove open field lines from the outer part of the open\nflux region irrespective of when they were opened, and\ngenerally these will correspond to relatively recently opened\nflux tubes which have moved into the nightside with the\nrotational flow. The consequences of this behavior for the\nstructure and dynamics of Saturn\u2019s tail have recently been\ndiscussed in detail by Milan et al. [2005]. While open field\nlines at the rim of the polar cap may have relatively short\nlifetimes, those within the central polar cap may remain\nopen for a much longer interval, thus forming a long tail in\nthe downstream solar wind, until they are closed by a major\ntail reconnection event which reaches into the center of the\ntail lobe. Related dynamics apply, of course, to the region of\nclosed field lines as well. That is, the closed magnetic flux\nwhich is opened on the dayside by magnetopause recon-\nnection and removed to the tail will generally correspond to\nflux closed relatively recently within the tail, transported to\nthe dayside by rotation in the outer magnetosphere. The\nbulk of the subcorotating closed flux within the middle and\ninner magnetosphere does not take part in this convection\ncycle.\n3.3. Steady Unbalanced Reconnection\n[17] A second instructive paradigm case is that of steady\nunbalanced reconnection. That is, we consider intervals\nduring which the magnetopause and tail reconnection rates\nare steady, but not the same as each other, such that the\namount of open flux in the system changes steadily with\ntime. In Figure 7 we show the situation for a modest level of\nsteady reconnection in the tail, starting at some particular\ntime, but where concurrent magnetopause reconnection is\nabsent. Figures 7a and 7b show the situation in the equa-\ntorial plane, where the nightside reconnection region is\nindicated by the long-dashed lines terminated by the\ncrosses. As in Figure 3, we again assume a preference for\nthe dawn sector due to the possible presence of Vasyliunas\ncycle outflow at dusk, though for simplicity this is again not\nrepresented in Figure 7. Figure 7a shows the situation when\nthe closed field lines formed during the interval (shown\nstippled) have rotated into the noon sector, while in\nFigure 7b they have rotated further, back into the post-\nmidnight sector. Assuming an overall rotational angular\nvelocity of around half of rigid corotation in the outer\nmagnetosphere, as indicated in sections 3.1 and 3.2, these\ndiagrams then correspond to times of \u000110 and \u000120 hours\nafter the tail reconnection started, respectively. We again\nnote that if Vasyliunas cycle outflow is present, the newly\nclosed flux tubes will not rotate back into the midnight sector\nin the simple manner shown in Figure 7b but will instead\nstretch out along the dusk flank of the tail with the Vasyliunas\ncycle flow before pinch-off and plasmoid formation occur, as\ndiscussed in section 3.2 in relation to Figure 5. In either case\nthe overall effect of the interval of reconnection is that the\nregion of closed flux in the outer magnetosphere will expand\nwith time, with the most recently reconnected flux at any\nlocal time being found in the outermost layer.\n[18] Figures 7c and 7d show the corresponding situation\nin the ionosphere. As in Figure 4, the open-closed field line\nboundary is shown by the solid line, except in the\npostmidnight sector where the mapped reconnection region\n(the \u2018\u2018merging gap\u2019\u2019) is indicated by dashed lines and\ncrosses, where it bulges modestly into the region of open\nflux. This boundary contracts slowly poleward at all local\ntimes as the amount of open flux decreases. The plasma\nflow at the boundary is directed equatorward across the\nboundary within the merging gap as open field lines\nbecome closed, while elsewhere the contracting boundary\nmoves poleward with the flow. The overall pattern of flow\nperturbation is thus again of twin-vortex form, added to the\nrotational flow as shown, and associated with a wedge\ncurrent system whose field-aligned currents are again\nshown in the region downstream of the merging gap. Hot\nplasma formed in the tail reconnection process precipitates\ninto this region forming an auroral bulge. Downstream of\nthe bulge, hot plasma will continue to precipitate on the\nnewly closed field lines, forming an auroral \u2018\u2018tail\u2019\u2019 which\nextends continuously from the bulge around the boundary\nvia dawn to noon in Figure 7c (after \u000110 hours) and\nthen via dusk into the nightside sector in Figure 7d (after\n\u000120 hours). This precipitation will occur immediately\nequatorward of the discrete auroras associated with the\nupward field-aligned currents circling the boundary, and it\nrepresents a significant enhancement of the general diffuse\nemissions from the outer magnetosphere. Overall, it can be\nseen that an interval of unbalanced tail reconnection will\nproduce a spiral pattern of closed field lines and associated\nprecipitation equatorward of the open-closed field line\nboundary, in which the latitude decreases with increasing\nlocal time around the boundary. We note that this is the\nsense in which the observed spirals are uniquely found to\nwind in Saturn auroral images [Ge\u00b4rard et al., 2004; Clarke\net al., 2005]. Eventually, of course, the individual turns of\nthe spiral lose their specific identities, overall resulting in the\nformation of an expanded region of hot plasma (and\npossibly outwardly diffused cool planetary plasma) in the\nouter magnetosphere.\n[19] In Figure 8 we show the corresponding situation in\nthe ionosphere for an interval of magnetopause reconnec-\ntion in the absence of tail reconnection, in the same format\nas Figure 7. In this case the open-closed field line boundary\nexpands equatorward at all local times, and the perturbation\nflow is such that the plasma moves poleward across the\nboundary in the region of the dayside merging gap as closed\nflux tubes are opened, while moving equatorward with the\nexpanding boundary at other local times. In Figure 8a the\nnew open flux has rotated from noon to midnight via dusk\n\u000115 hours after the onset of magnetopause reconnection\n(should the interval last that long), while in Figure 8b a\ncomplete ring of \u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 open flux has formed around the\nA02201 COWLEY ET AL.: SATURN\u2019S AURORAL DYNAMICS\n11 of 19\nA02201\nboundary after \u000130 hours. As time goes on, the new open\nflux region will thus again form a spiral pattern but now on\nopen field lines associated with polar cap expansion. The\nsense of the spiral is consequently opposite to that shown in\nFigure 7, with latitude increasing with increasing local time.\nWe would comment, however, that this scenario is probably\nrather unrealistic under usual conditions, because dayside\nreconnection is usually strongly modulated on shorter time-\nscales than those mentioned above due to fluctuations in the\nIMF direction [Jackman et al., 2004], a point reiterated here\nin the results shown in Figure 1. In this case the width of the\nspiral of newly opened field lines will be correspondingly\nstrongly modulated, with a \u2018\u2018wide\u2019\u2019 region being created\nwhen the reconnection rate is high during intervals of\nnorthward IMF, and a \u2018\u2018narrow\u2019\u2019 region when the reconnec-\ntion rate is low during intervals of southward IMF. After\ntheir creation these wide and narrow bands then subcorotate\naround in the polar cap until the open field lines are\nremoved by tail reconnection. Our picture is sufficient to\nemphasize, however, that during intervals when dayside\nreconnection is effective, the polar cap will be inflated by\nnew open flux addition preferentially into the postnoon and\ndusk sector, where the boundary is the first to be displaced\nequatorward. With regard to related auroral features (in\naddition to the usual discrete and diffuse emissions at and\nequatorward of the boundary) we would expect these to be\nconfined to the merging gap region near noon, associated\nwith cusp precipitation and the wedge current system\npresent there. As shown in Figure 8, the latter currents\nenhance the boundary currents on the prenoon side of the\nFigure 7. Sketches illustrating the consequences of an interval of modest steady tail reconnection, in the\nabsence of magnetopause reconnection. Shown are conditions in the equatorial plane after (a) \u000110 and\n(b) \u000120 hours and (c and d) corresponding conditions in the ionosphere. Format of the figures is the same\nas Figures 3\u20136, except that the active reconnection region in the tail, and its mapped counterpart in the\nionosphere, is shown by the long-dashed lines terminated with crosses.\nA02201 COWLEY ET AL.: SATURN\u2019S AURORAL DYNAMICS\n12 of 19\nA02201\ncusp and reduce or reverse the currents on the postnoon\nside. A detailed discussion of the latter currents and related\nprecipitation has recently been presented by E. J. Bunce et\nal. (Interplanetary magnetic field control of Saturn\u2019s polar\ncusp aurora, submitted to Annales Geophysicae, 2004,\nhereinafter referred to as Bunce et al., submitted manuscript,\n2004). We again note that cusp precipitation should continue\nonly for a few hours downstream of the merging site on a\ngiven open field line, as it propagates over the dayside\nmagnetopause following reconnection. Given the timescale\nof plasma rotation in the open field region (\u000130 hours), we\nthus expect cusp precipitation to occur on the newly opened\nfield lines only in the region immediately downstream of the\ndayside reconnection site.\n[20] The conditions discussed above of steady tail recon-\nnection in the absence of magnetopause reconnection, and\nvice versa, clearly represent limiting cases. In general,\nreconnection may be active in both regions, but at differing\nrates with respect to each other. The ionospheric config-\nurations representing these more general conditions are\nillustrated in Figure 9. In Figure 9a we show the situation\nin which the tail reconnection rate is higher than the dayside\nrate, such that overall the region of open flux is contracting\nwith time. In this case the auroral spiral expected to be\nformed by hot plasma precipitation from newly closed flux\ntubes flowing around the open-closed field line boundary\nshould still be present (in addition to emissions associated\nwith the field-aligned current systems and diffuse outer\nmagnetosphere precipitation), but its width will be reduced\non the dusk side of the mapped magnetopause reconnection\nregion compared with the dawn side. This occurs because\nthe outermost layer of closed tubes now flows to the dayside\nFigure 8. (a and b) Sketches illustrating the ionospheric consequences of an interval of steady\nmagnetopause reconnection in the absence of tail reconnection. Format is the same as in Figures 7c and\n7d.\nFigure 9.

In the case shown in Figure 9b where magneto-\npause reconnection exceeds tail reconnection, however,\nsuch that the open flux region expands with time, all of\nthe closed flux reconnected on the nightside flows directly\ninto magnetopause and is opened, such that the region of\nprecipitation of hot plasma is confined to the dawn sector,\nand a spiral is not formed on closed field lines. However,\nthe usual discrete and diffuse emission will still be present at\nall local times around the boundary, in addition to features\nassociated with the dayside cusp. We comment again,\nhowever, that under usual circumstances, dayside reconnec-\ntion will be sporadic on timescales of tens of minutes to a\nfew hours, as indicated by Jackman et al. [2004] and\nFigure 1. In this case the situation may therefore typically\nfluctuate on relatively short timescales between the two\nsituations shown in Figure 9, resulting in the general\nformation of an auroral spiral but with patchy regions\nof outer magnetosphere precipitation on the dusk side of\nnoon, as well, of course, as variable precipitation and\ncurrents in the dayside cusp.\n4. Auroral Response to CIR Compressions\n[21] With the above paradigm cases as background, we\nnow return to our discussion of the auroral responses to the\nCIR compression event summarized in Figure 1. It can be\nseen from Figure 1 that the central dark polar cap region\nobserved in Figure 1a before the compression had become\nfilled with bright auroras in the dawn sector \u000110 hours\nafter the onset of compression in Figure 1b, while after\n\u000140 hours in Figure 1c the auroras formed a bright spiral\nwith a central roughly circular dark region which was\nconsiderably contracted compared with Figure 1a. In terms\nof the discussion in sections 3.2 and 3.3, the poleward\nexpansion of the auroras in Figure 1b, and the contracted\npolar cap observed in Figure 1c, both strongly suggest a\nconnection with tail reconnection and the closure of open\nflux in the tail lobes. Following the brief discussion given by\nJackman et al. [2004], we thus propose that the magneto-\nspheric compression triggered an interval of rapid reconnec-\ntion in the tail which closed a substantial fraction of the\npreexisting open flux within a\u000110 hour interval and that the\nHST observed the auroral consequences. Such episodes of\nrapid closure of major amounts of open lobe flux triggered\nby interplanetary shocks have occasionally been reported at\nEarth [e.g., Petrinec and Russell, 1996; Sigwarth et al.,\n2000; Chua et al., 2001; Boudouridis et al., 2003, 2004;\nMilan et al., 2004; Meurant et al., 2004]. The detailed\nphysical mechanism is as yet unclear, but such magneto-\nspheric compressions will clearly lead to the rapid enhance-\nment of current densities within the plasma sheet and hence\nto possible instability leading to reconnection. For reasons\ndiscussed further in section 5, we here propose that such\ncompression-induced events occur commonly at Saturn in\nresponse to CIRs, leading also to the SKR correlation found\nearlier by Desch [1982] and Desch and Rucker [1983]. A\nsimilar auroral contraction occurred earlier in the Cassini-\nHST campaign in response to another CIR compression\nregion but was less well observed in HST data than that\ndisplayed here in Figure 1 [Clarke et al., 2005; Crary et al.,\n2005]. We can roughly estimate the tail reconnection rate\ninvolved in the event shown in Figure 1 from the auroral\nimages. Assuming that the \u2018\u2018dark\u2019\u2019 central polar region\nbounded by auroras represents the region of open flux\nmapping to the tail lobes, the contraction of this region\nbetween Figures 1a and 1b implies that roughly\u000120 GWb of\nopen flux was closed in the interval between the two images.\nAssuming further that this occurred wholly during the\n\u000110 hour interval following the arrival of the CIR forward\nshock prior to Figure 1b, we thus estimate an averaged\nreconnection rate of \u0001500 kVover the interval (1 Wb s\u00061 of\nopen flux closure corresponds to a tail reconnection rate of 1\nV from Faraday\u2019s law). We have no direct means of knowing\nwhen the tail reconnection took place during the interval, of\ncourse, so that the reconnection rate could have been higher\nover a proportionately shorter interval. In any event the value\nis considerably in excess of the estimated dayside reconnec-\ntion rates during the same interval, of typically several tens\nof kilovolts as seen in Figure 1, so that during this initial\ninterval, at least, dayside reconnection may be neglected.\n[22] Our interpretation of the initial auroral behavior is\nshown in Figure 10. We suppose that in response to the\nforward shock of the CIR and subsequent magnetospheric\ncompression an interval of rapid reconnection was initiated\nin Saturn\u2019s magnetic tail in which a significant fraction of\nthe open flux in the lobe was closed over an interval of\nseveral hours (a timescale less than Saturn\u2019s rotation\nperiod). We note from Figure 1a that at the time of the\ncompression the auroral oval was relatively expanded,\nindicative of a relatively inflated tail system. The equato-\nrial and ionospheric consequences a few hours after the\nonset of the event (say, 2\u20133 hours) are illustrated in\nFigures 10a and 10b, in which new closed flux containing\nhot plasma on the nightside forms a substantial bulge\nprotruding into the polar cap. This is again shown to\noccur preferentially on the dawn side of midnight on the\nassumption that Vasyliunas cycle flow may be active at\ndusk, as shown, though it seems possible that the\ndistended closed flux tubes in the dusk tail may them-\nselves become pinched off by the compression, with\nDungey cycle reconnection then occurring across the\nwhole tail. We also note that if the reconnection region\nextends quite far down the tail (a significant fraction of\nthe \u0001900 RS pitch of the spiral lobe field lines), then the\nmapping to the ionosphere will also be deflected toward\ndawn, as discussed in section 3.2. The newly closed flux\ntubes flow toward the planet in the tail and also rotate\ninto the dawn sector due to the ionospheric torque, possibly\nforming a bulge on the dawn magnetopause as shown in\nFigure 10a. In the ionosphere in Figure 10b the auroras will\nbe dominated by the bulge protruding into the postmidnight\ndark polar region, indicative of the closure of a significant\nfraction of the open flux in the system, though the usual\ndiscrete and diffuse emission will continue to be present at\nother local times. The perturbed flow in the ionosphere\ncarries the bulge equatorward and toward dawn, acting to\ndistribute the newly closed flux around the boundary and\nreturn the region of open flux to a more centered circular\nshape.\n[23] In Figures 10c and 10d we show the situation after\n\u000110 hours, where we suppose that tail reconnection is still\nA02201 COWLEY ET AL.: SATURN\u2019S AURORAL DYNAMICS\n14 of 19\nA02201\nactive but at a declining rate. Overall, we suppose that\naround half the preexisting open flux in the tail has now\nbeen closed, some \u000115 GWb, and with the small dayside\nreconnection rates prevailing, at least during this event as\nseen in Figure 1, the new open flux created during the\ninterval is small (\u00011\u20132 GWb). New closed flux tubes and\nhot plasma have now rotated from the reservoir in the tail all\naround the dawn magnetopause to reach the noon sector,\nsuch that the dawn region of the former polar cap has now\nbecome almost filled with closed flux tubes, precipitating\nhot plasma, and bright auroras. Discrete and diffuse emis-\nsions of lesser intensity continue to be present in the dusk\nFigure 10. Sketches illustrating the consequences of an interval of rapid reconnection in the tail, in\nwhich a significant fraction of the open flux in the tail lobes is closed on a timescale that is short\ncompared with the typical period of plasma subcorotation in the outer magnetosphere (\u000120 hours).\nShown are conditions in the equatorial plane after (a) 2\u20133, (c) \u000110, and (e) \u000120 hours and (b, d, and f )\ncorresponding conditions in the ionosphere. Format of the figures is the same as Figures 3\u20139. In\nFigures 10e and 10f, dayside reconnection is also in progress.\nA02201 COWLEY ET AL.: SATURN\u2019S AURORAL DYNAMICS\n15 of 19\nA02201\nsector. We propose that this situation is that captured by the\nHST in Figure 1b. We also suggest that the disturbed auroral\ndistribution presented by Prange\u00b4 et al. [2004] may represent\na similar configuration in a tail closure event which was\nperhaps more impulsive and of lesser intensity.\n[24] Figures 10e and 10f then show the situation after\n\u000120 hours, in which the closed flux tubes formed during the\nevent have now rotated back into the nightside sector via\nVasyliunas cycle activity at dusk. In the absence of the latter\nthe closed tubes simply rotate directly into the nightside, as\nshown previously in Figures 3 and 7. We again suppose that\ntail reconnection is active at modest rates, to which signif-\nicant but intermittent dayside reconnection is now added.\nAs pointed out previously by Jackman et al. [2004],\nsignificant open flux production at Saturn\u2019s magnetopause\nalso generally occurs during the CIR compression regions,\ndue to the generally elevated values of the compressed IMF.\nIn the present case, Figure 1 suggests the presence of\nvariable dayside reconnection peaking at \u0001300 kV during\nthe relevant interval. At this stage the compression event has\nnow resulted in the formation of a complete ring of newly\ninjected closed field lines and hot plasma around the planet\nin the outer magnetosphere, as shown in Figure 10e, such\nthat the region of closed flux has expanded compared with\nits formerly compressed state. In the ionosphere the newly\nclosed flux forms a spiral around the pole, as shown in\nFigure 10f, and the dark region of open flux has returned to\na more circular form but with a reduced radius compared\nwith its initial value. A more modest bulge persists in the\npostmidnight sector while tail reconnection is still active, as\nshown previously in Figure 7, while the band of new closed\nflux is thinned somewhat in the noon sector and down-\nstream thereof, when magnetopause reconnection is active\nat appreciable rates, as indicated in section 3.3 in relation to\nFigure 9. The new open flux rotates into the postnoon and\ndusk sector, where the open-closed boundary correspond-\ningly begins to expand equatorward. This configuration\nseems similar to the HST image shown in Figure 1c. We\nnote that according to our discussion the auroral morphol-\nogy should have evolved appreciably toward that shown in\nFigure 10f by \u000120 hours after the onset of the event (the\ncirculation time in the outer magnetosphere), and it will then\nremain of similar form while tail reconnection remains\nactive at rates comparable with or larger than the mean\ndayside rate, as indicated in the discussion of Figure 9a.\nAccording to the magnetopause reconnection voltages esti-\nmated in Figure 1, the requirement is that the tail recon-\nnection rate should at least exceed \u0001100 kV. We recall that\nthe HST image shown in Figure 1c corresponds to an\ninterval \u000140 hours after the onset of the compression event,\nfrom which we infer that conditions then remained as\nenvisaged here in Figures 9a and 10f.\n[25] After the initial period of significant reconnection\nand flux closure in the tail we suppose that the tail\nreconnection rate drops to smaller values, while the dayside\nrate remains intermittent but of significant averaged value.\nThe open flux in the tail lobes then starts to expand once\nmore, and with it the size of the dark polar cap in the\nionosphere. For example, if the dayside reconnection rate\nexceeds the nightside rate by an averaged \u0001100 kV during\nthe final \u00012 days of the CIR compression region, as seems\nplausible from Figure 1 and more generally from the results\nof Jackman et al. [2004], then the net amount of open flux\nproduced will be \u000115 GWb, sufficient to reinflate the lobe\nand polar cap back to its former dimensions. In the HST\nimage shown Figure 1d, \u00014.5 days after the onset of\ncompression, the dark polar cap has clearly increased\nsignificantly in size, though perhaps not fully to that seen\nin the image shown in Figure 1a. A more quantitative\ndiscussion of these images and their implications for flux\nchanges and reconnection rates, based on the qualitative\npicture presented here, awaits future analysis. The auroral\nluminosity in this final image is suggested to be produced\nby the discrete auroras at the open-closed field line bound-\nary associated with the upward field-aligned currents flow-\ning there, combined with diffuse auroras extending\nequatorward resulting from precipitation of the hot plasma\ninjected into the outer magnetosphere by the compression\nevent, possibly augmented in the dawn sector in the manner\ndepicted in Figure 9b.\n5. Summary and Discussion\n[26] The first detailed sequence of images of Saturn\u2019s\nUV auroras were obtained by the HST in January 2004,\nin coordination with Cassini observations of the upstream\ninterplanetary medium and SKR emissions. These obser-\nvations show that the auroras and related SKR emissions\nrespond strongly to CIR-related compression regions in\nthe interplanetary medium, the auroras becoming first\nsignificantly enhanced and broadened in the dawn sector,\nbefore assuming a pronounced spiral form, lasting a few\ntens of hours after the onset [Clarke et al., 2005; Crary\net al., 2005; Kurth et al., 2005]. Possibly related effects\nhave also been reported by Prange\u00b4 et al. [2004], associ-\nated in this case with a CME shock tracked to Saturn\nfrom the Sun via Earth and Jupiter. We suggest that these\neffects thus represent the auroral counterparts of the\nstrong solar wind dynamic pressure modulations of\nSKR emission found previously in Voyager data by\nDesch [1982] and Desch and Rucker [1983]. In this\npaper we provide an interpretative scenario for these\nobservations, based on reconnection dynamics in a rota-\ntion-dominated magnetosphere. The picture discussed ef-\nfectively combines the steady state picture of Saturn\u2019s\nmagnetosphere presented previously by Cowley et al.\n[2004a] with the reconnection dynamics discussed by\nCowley and Lockwood [1992] in the terrestrial context,\nbut with the important effects of planetary rotation at\nSaturn now included. These concepts are used to discuss\nthe effects of reconnection pulses and of intervals of\nsteady but unbalanced tail and dayside reconnection in\nSaturn\u2019s magnetosphere. It is pointed out that in a\nrotation-dominated magnetosphere the latter scenario nat-\nurally results in the formation of spirals of new open or\nnew closed flux around the rotation axis as the open-\nclosed field line boundary expands or contracts. The\nsense of the spiral formed by net flux closure is same\nas that uniquely observed in Saturn auroral images\n[Ge\u00b4rard et al., 2004; Clarke et al., 2005]. In the simple\npicture suggested here, therefore, auroral spirals are\nformed by hot plasma precipitation on newly closed flux\ntubes and should be observed when the tail reconnection\nrate exceeds the dayside rate, such that the region of open\nA02201 COWLEY ET AL.: SATURN\u2019S AURORAL DYNAMICS\n16 of 19\nA02201\nflux contracts with time. When the dayside rate exceeds\nthe tail rate, however, such that the open flux region\nexpands with time, the tail-produced spiral will be trun-\ncated in the noon sector by dayside reconnection. The\naurora will then be enhanced at dawn, though emissions\nassociated with the cusp, open-closed field line boundary,\nand outer magnetosphere may continue into the dusk\nsector. These simple pictures assume that the duration\nof the reconnection intervals exceeds the subcorotational\nperiod of outer magnetosphere or polar cap field lines,\ntaken to be roughly \u000120 and \u000130 hours, respectively.\nHowever, the usual fluctuations of the north-south IMF\ncomponent on shorter timescales implies that this will\nrarely be satisfied for dayside reconnection, such that an\nauroral spiral may be formed on closed field lines\nwhenever significant tail reconnection is active, though\ndayside reconnection may result in significant structuring\nin the postnoon sector.\n[27] Within this picture we then propose that the\nfeatures observed in the HST auroral data shown in\nFigure 1 [Clarke et al., 2005], and in related SKR data\n[Kurth et al., 2005], are produced by the onset of a\nseveral-hour interval of rapid reconnection in Saturn\u2019s tail,\ntriggered by the sudden magnetospheric compression\nproduced by the forward shock of a CIR compression\nregion in the interplanetary medium. In the several hours\nfollowing the onset of compression (which overall lasts\ntypically a few days), a significant fraction (around a\nhalf) of the open flux in Saturn\u2019s tail lobes becomes\nclosed, implying reconnection rates of, e.g., \u0001500 kV\nover \u000110 hours (or higher values over proportionately\nshorter intervals). Similar shock-induced major flux clo-\nsure events have also been reported at Earth on a number\nof occasions [e.g., Petrinec and Russell, 1996; Sigwarth\net al., 2000; Chua et al., 2001; Boudouridis et al., 2003,\n2004; Milan et al., 2004; Meurant et al., 2004], but, as\ndiscussed further below, they may occur more often and\nmore routinely at Saturn, due to the more CIR-evolved\nnature of the interplanetary medium at these distances\nand the longer timescales of substorm-related dynamics\n[Jackman et al., 2004]. The onset of rapid reconnection\nin the tail initially produces a bulge of newly closed field\nlines and hot plasma precipitation in the previously dark\npolar cap region on the nightside, possibly favoring the\npostmidnight sector. Over subsequent hours these flux\ntubes will then subcorotate around the magnetopause\nboundary via dawn, reaching the dayside sector after\n\u000110 hours and forming a complete spiral around the\npole after \u000120 hours, following which the pattern\nremains of similar form until the tail reconnection rate\ndeclines. The corollary in the magnetosphere is the\ninjection of hot plasma on newly closed flux tubes from\nthe tail around the magnetopause boundary, initially into\nthe dawn sector and later at increasing local times. The\nflux transport from the tail causes the closed field line\nregion to expand outwards once more, compared with its\ninitially compressed state. We note that the signatures of\nthese phenomena should be apparent in in situ Cassini\nfield and plasma data should a compression event occur\nwhen the spacecraft is traversing the outer region of\nSaturn\u2019s magnetosphere, particularly in the postmidnight\nand dawn sector.\n[28] After 1\u20132 days, however, we propose that the tail\nreconnection rate drops to smaller values, less than\n\u0001100 kV. This effect may be controlled by the concur-\nrent behavior of the dynamic pressure of the interplan-\netary medium during the event. Since averaged dayside\nreconnection rates in the high-field intervals of CIR\ncompression regions generally exceed such values [Jack-\nman et al., 2004], the open flux in the system then\nstarts to increase once more, and with it the size of the\ndark polar cap. We then expect the auroras to revert to a\nmore normal \u2018\u2018auroral oval\u2019\u2019 configuration, possibly with\ncontinuing intermittent signatures of reconnection in the\ndayside cusp (Bunce et al., submitted manuscript, 2004).\nTypically, the amount of flux which is opened in the last\n\u00012 days of a 4 day CIR compression region is sufficient\nto reinflate the tail lobe and polar cap back to their\nformer size prior to the compression, as the solar wind\ndynamic pressure declines. The magnetosphere is then\n\u2018\u2018primed\u2019\u2019 for the next compression event which may\ntypically occur \u00018 days later, though it is possible that\nsignificant open field inflation and internally generated tail\ndynamics may occur in the interval between [Jackman et al.,\n2004].\n[29] Overall, it will be seen that the underlying physics\nof Saturn\u2019s auroral disturbances suggested here, and\nrelated effects in the outer magnetosphere, are fundamen-\ntally similar to those at Earth, involving open flux\ntransport to and from the tail via the Dungey cycle.\nHowever, the auroral morphology to which these processes\ngive rise is strongly influenced by the rapid planetary\nrotation at Saturn, as described above, while the way in\nwhich auroral and other (e.g., SKR) disturbances relate to\nthe interplanetary medium is altered by the differing\ntimescales that apply. At Earth, intervals of southward\nIMF which inflate the polar cap and tail with open flux\noften last for tens of minutes to an hour or two, sufficient\nto bring the tail to instability at the end of substorm\n\u2018\u2018growth phases\u2019\u2019 which typically last 30\u201340 min. Con-\nsequently, a strong correlation is found in this case\nbetween auroral and related disturbances and southward\nIMF. In addition, the tens of minutes to few-hour timescales\nof substorms, relative to the few-day typical timescales\nbetween interplanetary shocks, shows why shock-induced\nevents will be relatively rare in this case, such that most\nopen flux closure events (specifically substorms) are not\ntriggered by shocks. When shocks do occur, the auroral\nresponse is found to depend strongly on the concurrent\ndirection of the IMF, with major \u2018\u2018closure\u2019\u2019 events occur-\nring during intervals of southward directed IMF when the\nexisting auroral oval is relatively expanded, an effect\nknown as \u2018\u2018preconditioning\u2019\u2019 [e.g., Boudouridis et al.,\n2003, 2004; Meurant et al., 2004]. At Saturn, however,\nthe typical timescales for variations of the north-south\ncomponent of the IMF are similar to Earth, tens of\nminutes to a few hours, while the timescale required to\nbring the tail to instability is much longer, typically many\ndays, as recently discussed by Jackman et al. [2004]. In\nthis case it is obvious that a similar correlation of auroral\nand related disturbances with intervals of northward IMF\nwill not be apparent. In addition, because the expected\nseveral-day timescale for substorms at Saturn is compa-\nrable to the intervals between interplanetary shocks gen-\nA02201 COWLEY ET AL.: SATURN\u2019S AURORAL DYNAMICS\n17 of 19\nA02201\nerated by recurrent CIRs and CMEs, the probability that\nan open flux closure event will be initiated in a partly\ninflated tail by a shock-related magnetospheric compres-\nsion, rather than a substorm being initiated by an internal\ninstability or external trigger unrelated to shocks [e.g.,\nLyons et al., 1997], will be greatly enhanced. The\nresponse to such shocks will undoubtedly be influenced\nby magnetospheric preconditioning, as at Earth, but that\nwill now depend upon the past history of the system and\ninterplanetary medium over several previous days, rather\nthan simply on the near-concurrent state of the IMF as at\nEarth. In the case discussed in this paper, for example, a\nslow and intermittent accumulation of open flux is\nexpected (on the basis of equation (1)) to have taken\nplace in the several-day rarefaction interval prior to the\ncompression, which will have contributed to the relatively\nexpanded state of the auroral oval observed prior to the\nevent. Overall, we conclude that a significant fraction of\nopen flux closure events at Saturn may be compression-\ninduced, possibly the majority, thus leading to the ob-\nserved strong correlation between auroral and related\ndisturbances and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind.\nWe may not conclude directly from such a correlation,\nhowever, that the underlying physics of the magneto-\nspheric interaction with the interplanetary medium is\nnecessarily of a fundamentally differing character.\n[30] Acknowledgments.
