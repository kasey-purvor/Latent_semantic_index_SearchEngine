Primarily\nthis is because knowledge of this variation will inform the design\nand analysis of association studies for complex diseases [25, 6],\nand also because of interest in the evolutionary forces affecting\nrecombination hotspots [8, 17, 16].\nIn recent years, recombination hotspots have been found by direct\nobservation of crossovers in sperm [7, 9, 10]. While these give\naccurate measurements of current local recombination rates, and\nposition of recombination hotspots, analysis of sperm is costly and\ntime-consuming, and has so far been restricted to a small number of\ngenetic regions.\nTo learn about genome-wide variation in recombination rates and\nhotpots, analysis of population genetic diversity data has proven\nmore successful [1, 14, 24, 18, 5, 16], particularly due to the\nlarge amount of SNP genotype data describing genetic variation in\ndifferent human populations [23].\nHere we describe a new method for detecting recombination\nhotspots from population genetic data. This method uses the appro-\nximate marginal likelihood method of [3] and is closely related to\nthe methods described in [4] and [5]. The approach scans through\na chromosomal region of interest, and considers fitting a recombi-\nnation hotspot at a set of possible locations (from a pre-specified\n\u2217to whom correspondence should be addressed\ngrid). For each possible hotspot location, a likelihood ratio statistic\nis calculated for the test of whether a hotspot is present. The set\nof likelihood ratio statistic values can be then be used to visually\nshow the evidence for a recombination hotspot at different positions\nalong the chromosome and to flag up likely locations for hotspots\n(see Section 2.3 for more details).\nWhilst similar, this approach differs from those of [4] and [5]. For\nboth these approachs the chromosomal region was split up into a\nseries of sub-regions (defined to each contain a specified number of\nconsecutive SNPs), and then the likelihood curve for the recombina-\ntion rate was calculated for each sub-region under the assumption of\na constant recombination rate within that sub-region. (The methods\ndescribed in [4] and [5] differ in how they combine the informa-\ntion from these separate sub-regions into evidence for hotspots at\ndifferent locations.)\nThe advantage of the new approach described here is firstly com-\nputational, with CPU times being reduced by over an order of\nmagnitude (see Section 4.1). This is because the Monte Carlo effort\nfor calculating the likelihood ratio statistic for a hotspot at each\npossible position can be curtailed when it becomes obvious that eit-\nher there is little or there is overwhelming evidence for a hotspot\n(see Section 2.4). Secondly, the method allows for a more accurate\nestimate of the background recombination rate through using the\nPACL method of [12] (see [20] and discussion in [5]) and allows\nfor this background rate to vary across large chromosomal regions.\nFinally the new approach can more accurately be applied to regions\nof data where the SNP density is low. For such regions, the ear-\nlier approaches would estimate a constant recombination rate over\npotentially large sub-regions, and any signal from a hotspot within\nthat sub-region would be weakened due to the averaging of a small\nhotspot with larger non-hotspot (background) regions. This is avoi-\nded within the new method by always fitting an appropriate hotspot\nmodel, consisting of a small hotspot region flanked by a background\nregion.\nWe have compared our new method for detecting hotspots with\nthe earlier methods of [4] and [5], as well as the HotspotFisher\nprogram of [11] and the LDhot program of [14, 16].\n2 METHOD\nOur methods takes as input haplotype data from n chromosomes each typed\nat L SNPs in a specific region. Our method also assumes an estimate of\nthe background recombination rate across the whole region, though this\nbackground rate can be allowed to vary across the region. Details of one\napproach, the one used for the results given in this paper, for both phasing\ngenotype data and for estimating the background recombination rate is given\nin Section 2.4\nc\u00a9 Oxford University Press 2006. 1\nSample et al\n2.1 Overview of Method\nOur approach is to consider a grid of possible hotspot positions, and to eva-\nluate the evidence for the presence of the hotspot at each of these positions.\nTo define the grid, we specify a hotspot width, w, and a spacing, l (see\nSection 2.2). Assume the L SNPs are at ordered positions x1, . . . , xL, and\nwithout loss of generality relabel positions so that x1 = 1. Let N be the\nlargest integer such that N \u00d7 l + w < xL. Then our algorithm consists of\nthe following loop:\nFor i = 0, . . . , N :\n(i) Consider a hotspot from position i\u00d7 l to i\u00d7 l+w. Denote \u03c1 to be the\nrecombination rate within the hotspot and \u03c1(i)\nb\nto be the background\nrecombination rate close to this hotspot.\n(ii) Choose S SNPs close to this hotspot, and summarise the data by the\nsequences defined solely by the alleles at these S SNPs.\n(iii) Use the Approximate Marginal Likelihood method of [3] to estimate\nLRi the likelihood-ratio statistic for \u03c1 > \u03c1(i)b against \u03c1 = \u03c1\n(i)\nb\n, for\nthe data chosen in (ii).\nThe output of the method is a set of likelihood ratio statistics {LRi}Ni=0\nfor the presence of a hotspot of width w starting at positions 0, l, . . . , N\u00d7 l.\nThese likelihood ratio statistics are estimated based on an Importance Samp-\nling approach [2, 3]. They are estimated under a standard neutral coalescent\nmodel, though the likelihood for such a model has been shown to be robust\nfor inference of relative recombination rates [20].\nWhilst this is a non-regular inference problem, simulation studies [3, 4]\nsuggest that the null distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic is approxi-\nmately an equal mixture of a point mass at 0, and a chi-squared distribution\nwith one degrees of freedom. A plot of the likelihood ratio statistic against\nhotspot position (see for example Figure 1) can give a picture of the evi-\ndence for the presence of a hotspot against position across the chromosomal\nregion. Details of how we use this output to give predictions for the position\nof hotspots is given in Section 2.3.\n2.2 Details of Method\nThe method requires specifying a number of parameters. We describe here\nthe default choices of our method, which are suitable for analysing human\npopulation genetic data and are the values we used for the results shown\nin this paper. Firstly we chose the hotspot width w = 2000 and spacing\nl = 1000. The width is based on evidence that hotspots are of the order\nof 1-2kb [7], and the spacing is based on a trade-off between computational\ncost and accuracy. In calculating the Likelihood ratio statistic in step (iii) we\nallow for a range for the hotspot recombination rate, and these where chosen\nto be between 10 and 100 times the background rate.\nThe choice of the number of SNPs, S, in step (ii) of the algorithm is again\na trade-off between the information in the data summary, and the compu-\ntational cost and Monte Carlo error in the estimate of the likelihood ratio\nstatistic. We chose S = 7, which appears to give a noticeable improve-\nment over S = 6, while increasing S further did not appear to substantially\nimprove performance.\nThe algorithm for choosing which SNPs to keep in step (ii) is based upon\nthe intuition that the most informative set of SNPs will have larger minor\nallele frequency and be equally spaced in or close to the putative hotspot.\n2.3 Summarising Output\nGiven the likelihood ratio statistic for one putative hotspot position LRi,\nthe simplest approach is to predict the presence of a hotspot if LRi > c\nfor some cutoff c. The approximate null distribution of the likelihood ratio\nstatistic can be used to specify a suitable value for c. Values of c = 10 and\nc = 12 would produce a false-positive approximately once every 1200 and\n3700 independent tests respectively (and are what we choose for the results\nin this paper). Given a hotspot spacing of 1kb, and making the conserva-\ntive approximation that tests for hotspot positions are independent, then this\n0 50 100 150 200\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n10\n0\nPosition (kb)\nLR\nFig. 1. Example output from sequenceLDhot. The raw output is the\nLikelihood Ratio values for each putative hotspot (shown by black horizontal\nlines if non-zero). These are converted into extended hotspot regions (deno-\nted by green horizonal lines), for each such region we infer a single hotspot\n(position given by red vertical lines \u2013 height of lines gives the evidence for\nthat hotspot). These results are for a cutoff of c = 12 (red horizontal line).\nwould suggest a false-positive rate of less than 1 per 1.2Mb and 1 per 3.7Mb\nrespectively.\nHowever this simple approach is likely to predict a number of hotspot\npositions for each true hotspot, as each real hotspot will overlap a number\nof the putative hotspot positions within our grid. Furthermore even a hotspot\nnear, but not overlapping, the putative hotspot may produce some evidence of\na hotspot, as its presence will reduce the amount of Linkage Disequilibrium\n(LD) within the sub-region covered by the S SNPs chosen in step (ii) of the\nmethod. Thus the patterns generated by the S SNPs may fit a hotspot model\nbetter than a no-hotspot model, even if the hotspot is in the wrong position.\nAs a result we summarise the output of our method by a set of disjoint\nextended hotspot regions, which are defined to be contiguous regions with\nevidence for a hotspot. Each extended hotspot region contains at least one\nputative hotspot with LR > c. Extending out from this putative hotspot we\nthen include all hotspot positions with LR > 4 , and all hotspot positions\nthat overlap with a more distant hotspot position that have LR > c. The\nidea is to describe in an automated way a contiguous region that contains all\nhotspot positions whose LR value may have been affected by the presence\nof the putative hotspot, and thus to avoid inferring clusters of nearby hots-\npots all except one of which are likely to be false positives. (More accurate\nmethods may be possible, but this ad hoc approach appears to work well in\npractice.)\nWithin each extended hotspot region we then infer a single hotspot, whose\nposition is chosen to be the hotspot position with the largest likelihood ratio\nvalue within that extended hotspot region.\nSee Figure 1 for an example of output of our method, and the definition\nof the extended hotspot regions and the inferred hotspots.\n2.4 Implementation\nTo obtain haplotype data from genotype data we used PHASEv2.1 [22,\n21]. To obtain estimates of the background recombination rate we used the\ninferred recombination rates within PHASEv2.1 obtained under the -MR\nflag [12]. These estimates are based on a model which allows a different\nrecombination rate between each pair of consecutive SNPs. To estimate the\nbackground recombination rate at a position x we took the median of all the\nrecombination rates esimated within a 100kb window centered on x. (The\nprogram sequenceLDhot is able to directly input the appropriate output\nfrom PHASEv2.1; )\nThe final detail of implementing our method, is the number of Monte\nCarlo simulations used within step (iii) of the method. We allowed this\nto vary across different putative hotspots, depending on the evidence for a\n2\nshort Title\nhotspot. We specified a minimum, N0 and maximum K \u00d7 N0 number of\niterations. Every k \u00d7 N0 iterations, for k = 1, 2, . . . ,K \u2212 1 we checked\nthe current estimate of the likelihood ratio statistic LRi. If LRi < 4 or\nLRi > 20 then we stopped the Monte Carlo simulations for that putative\nhotspot. The idea is to stop the simulations if there is either little or over-\nwhelming evidence for a hotspot. The choices of cut-off value where chosen\nto be a factor of roughly 2 different from the cutoffs of LRi > 10 and\nLRi > 12 considered for detecting hotspots.\nThis idea of curtailing the Monte Carlo simulation in step (iii) substanti-\nally reduces the computation cost of the method, and was found to have no\nnoticeable effect on the performance of the method. For the results shown\nhere we chose N0 = 300 and K = 50. The Monte Carlo method in step\n(iii) uses bridge sampling [15]. For each set of 300 Monte Carlo simulations\nwe used 100 simulation from each of 3 driving values; see [2] - one being\nthe background recombination rate and two being rates consistent with a\nhotspot.\n3 DATA AND OTHER METHODS\nWe compare our method to four recent methods, these are\n(i) the Likelihood Ratio method of [4];\n(ii) the Penalised Likelihood of [5], code available from\nhttp:\/\/www.maths.lancs.ac.uk\/\u223cfearnhea;\n(iii) the HotspotFisher program of [11] which is available from\nhttp:\/\/bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn\/member\/\u223clijun; and\n(iv) the LDhot program of [16].\nOur comparisons were based on three sets of simulated data taken from a\nnumber of recent papers. The names we use for each set of simulations,\nbased upon the real data the simulations try to mimic, together with brief\ndescriptions are as follows:\nSeattleSNP These data sets attempt to mimic data from the SeattleSNP, and\nconsist of 200 independent data sets, each for a 25kb region sampled from a\nEuropean and African American population; the sample sizes are 23 and 24\nindividual respectively, and 100 data sets contain no hotspots, and the other\n100 each contain a single hotspot. These are taken from [5].\nHapMap Encode These data sets consist of one hundred 200kb regions,\nsampled in three populations (European, Asian and African). Each region\ncontains a random number of hotspots (mean close to 4), and 90% of recom-\nbination events occur within the hotspots. Sample sizes are 90 individuals\nfor each population. These are the HQ= 90% data sets from [11].\nHuman-Chimp These data sets are taken from [24] and were generated\nempirically from real data. They consist of data from 3 different Encode\nregions (4q26, 7q21 and 7q31), in European, African and chimp populati-\nons. In humans, the average background rate in the 3 regions were 0.5\u20130.6\ncM\/Mb, 0.4 cM\/Mb and 0.4 cM\/Mb respectively. Each data set consists of\na 100kb region with a 2kb hotspot at position 49kb-51kb. A range of hots-\npot sizes were considered, and we give results for hotspots of the following\nintensities (all cM\/Mb): 0.8, 4, 8, 16, 40, 80, and 160. Sample sizes were 60,\n60 and 38 respectively. SNP density varied considerably: 1.8 per kb (Euro-\npean), 2.5 per kb (African), and 0.6 per kb (chimp).\nFor further details of these data sets, see the original papers. The Seatt-\nleSNP and HapMap Encode simulations both used the cosi program of\n[19].\nThe HapMap Encode simulate data sets are available from\nhttp:\/\/bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn\/member\/\u223clijun, and the other data sets are\navailable from\nhttp:\/\/www.maths.lancs.ac.uk\/\u223cfearnhea\/Hotspot.\n4 RESULTS\nWe now give the results of our new method, sequenceLDhot,\non the three sets of simulated data sets as described in Sec-\ntion 3. All simulated data sets provide genotype information, and\nTable 1.

For the power results we show for\nsequenceLDhot, we treat a hotspot as found if it overlaps with\nan inferred hotspot. We count as false-positives any hotspots that do\nnot overlap with a true hotspot. (Thus we ignore the extended hots-\npot regions when calculating power and false positive rates, which\nmakes comparisons with existing methods fair.)\n4.1 SeattleSNPs\nOur first comparison is with the Likelihood Ratio (LR) method\nof [4] and the Penalised Likelihood (PL) method of [5]. Firstly,\nthe computation involved using sequenceLDhot is substantially\nsmaller than that of either of the LR or PL methods. All methods\nrequire the use of PHASE to infer haplotypes. For an example data\nset sequenceLDhot took 10 minutes to analyse the resulting\nhaplotype data; whereas both the LR and PL methods took of the\norder of 4 hours.\nTable 1 gives the results of the three methods. In testing for\nhotspots we used a cutoff value of c = 10, as this gave com-\nparable false positive rates to the other two methods. The power\nof sequenceLDhot is greater that either of the two alternative\napproaches, with power averaged across the two populations being\n69% for sequenceLDhot, 65% for the PL method, and 50% for\nthe LR method.\n3\nSample et al\nHuman\nHotspot Rate cM\/Mb\nPo\nwe\nr\n0.8 4 8 16 40 80 160\n0\n0.\n5\n1\nChimp\nHotspot Rate cM\/Mb\nPo\nwe\nr\n0.8 4 8 16 40 80\n0\n0.\n5\n1\nFig. 2.

In both plots vertical bars give appro-\nximate 95% confidence intervals on the estimates of power. Recombination\nrate for hotspot is on a log scale.\n4.2 HapMap Encode\nWe next analysed the HapMap Encode simulated data, HotspotFisher.\nWhile each data set consists of 200kb sequenced in 90 individu-\nals, to speed up the implementation of our method (in particular to\nreduce the CPU cost of PHASE) we subsampled just 45 individu-\nals, and analysed separately the first and last 110kb of sequence. We\nchose to split the sequence in this way so that for putative hotspots\nat positions close to 100kb we would still have sufficient informa-\ntive SNPs surrounding the hotspot that we would not suffer any\nloss of power. Our method then took on the order of 1\u20132 hours\nto analyse a single 200kb data set (which includes running both\nPHASE and sequenceLDhot), as compared to a few minutes for\nHotspotFisher.\nResults are given in Table 2. When testing for hotspots we used\na cut-off of c = 12 so that our method had similar false positive\nrates to HotspotFisher. We have a noticeable improvement in\npower over HotspotFisher: when averaged over three popula-\ntion, we have a power of 79% as compared to 67%. However, for\ninferred hotspots, HotspotFisher is more accurate at detecting\nthe hotspot position.\nOne noticeable problem with our method is in terms of detec-\nting individual hotspots when they cluster together. In these cases\nour method will tend to infer a large extended hotspot region, and\nthus a single hotspot. The power of our method increases by 8% if\nwe include as detected all hotspots that lie fully within any exten-\nded hotspot region. (The average hotspot region is around 5\u20136kb in\nlength.)\n4.3 Human-Chimp\nFinally we analysed the human-chimp data. We ran sequenceLDhot\non all data sets, and HotspotFisher on the human datasets (we\nhad technical difficulties with running HotspotFisher on the\nchimp data). We also obtained results for LDhot from Table S3 of\n[24]. These data sets only enable us to compare power (as oppo-\nsed to false-positive rates), as they all contain a known hotspot, but\nthe recombination landscape in the remaining part of the region is\nunknown.\nThe results for sequenceLDhot and HotspotFisher give\nvalues for the power of the method for 7 different recombination\nrates of the hotspot ranging from 0.8 cM\/Mb to 160 cM\/Mb. (As\ncompared to a background rate in humans of approximately 0.4\ncM\/Mb.) We pooled results for all three regions together, and also\npooled results from both human populations.\nFor comparison between sequenceLDhot and HotspotFisher\nwe chose a cutoff value of c = 12 as for this value the two\nmethods had similar false positive rates for the HapMap Encode\ndata. The resulting estimated power curves for both methods are\nshown by the black and blue curves in Figure 2. Again we see\nthat sequenceLDhot is more powerful at inferring hotspots than\nHotspotFisher.\nTable S3 of [24] gives power of LDhot (at a 5% significance\nlevel) for different hotspot intensities. For human hotspots, they\nonly give power values for hotspots with intensity close to 8cM\/Mb;\nfor chimp hotspots they give power values for a range of hotspot\nintensities. We have plotted these values on Figure 2 (green curve).\nFor comparison we also give power curves for sequenceLDhot\nwith cutoff c = 5, which gives a similar nominal significance\nlevel to LDhot. The results suggest that LDhot is more power-\nful at estimating hotspots of strength close to 8cM\/Mb (20 times the\nbackground rate) in the human data. For the chimp data it appears\nthat sequenceLDhot is more powerful for weaker hotspots (up\nto around 16cM\/Mb; and LDhot is more powerful for inferring\nhotspots that are stronger than 16cM\/Mb.\n5 DISCUSSION\nOur new method has a number of advantages over existing methods.\nIt is substantially quicker, and appears to be more powerful than\nthe Likelihood Ratio method of [4] and the Penalised Likelihood\nmethod of [5]. The gain in computational speed is substantial, and\nthe new method is scalable to analysing genome-wide data. For\nexample analysing a 200kb data set in the HapMap Encode analysis\ntook of the order of 1\u20132 hours computing. So analysying a genome-\nwide data set would take of the order of 1000 CPU days, which is\npracticable as the analysis is trivially parallelisable.\nOur method appears to be more powerful at detecting hotspots\nthan HotspotFisher, though the latter method is both quicker\nthan ours, and can localise the position of the hotspots more accura-\ntely. The reason it appears more accurate at inferring the position of\nthe hotspots is likely to be due to the finer grid it uses for putative\nhotspots.\nA comparison with LDhot is more difficult, as this method is\ncurrently not publicly available. The comparison we did had the\nproblem that we could only compare the power of the different\nmethods, and not also the false positive rates. Whilst we attemp-\nted to perform a comparison where the methods had similar putative\nfalse-positive rates, there was not way to check these in practice.\nHowever, this comparison based on the published power results\nLDhot suggests that sequenceLDhot may be more powerful for\nweaker hotspots, and perhaps data with lower SNP density; whereas\nLDhot is more powerful for stronger hotspots and data with higher\nSNP density. Both these results seem plausible. Firstly, the power\nof sequenceLDhot is reliant on correctly choosing informative\nSNPs to be used to calculate the Likelihood Ratio statistics. If it\nchooses these well, then it fully utilises the information contained in\nthese SNPs, but a poor choice may mean that it misses hotspots that\n4\nshort Title\nwould be obvious from a different choice of SNPs. This may mean\nit works poorly, compared to other methods, for stronger hotspots\n\u2013 where the occasional choice of a poor set of SNPs will limit its\npower slightly away from 100%. Secondly, as SNP density increases\nsubstantially (to say greater than 1 SNP per kb), sequenceLDhot\nis unable to fully utilise this extra information as it always calculates\nthe Likelihood Ratio statistics based on a fixed number of SNPs. By\ncomparison LDhot will continue to be able to take account of the\ninformation in these extra SNPs regardless of how high SNP density\nbecomes.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis work was supported by EPSRC grant GR\/S18786\/01.
