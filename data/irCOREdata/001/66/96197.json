Introduction \n \nThere is wide agreement that many areas of contemporary policy making are \nunintelligible if observers do not take into account processes that transcend the \nboundaries of individual states: financial regulation, food safety standards, \nenvironmental management systems, taxation, intellectual property, telecommunication, \ninfectious disease control, accounting standards, to name but a few policy domains \nwhere global factors can be expected to be influential, and sometimes decisive. Beyond \nthat basic insight, though, there is little agreement among analysts on the relative \nimportance of \u2018global\u2019 as opposed to more \u2018local\u2019 factors (however defined) and on how \nglobal and local factors interact to produce policies and policy outcomes. To be sure, \ndisagreements often stem from differing interpretations of specific events or \nrelationships: for instance, whether a particular policy choice was made mainly in order \nto protect the market share of a national industry vis-\u00e0-vis competitors based in \njurisdictions where that policy was already implemented; or whether governments that \nare members of a particular international organization are more likely than others to \nadopt a certain policy. But sometimes interpretations of global dimensions of policy \nmaking vary for a more fundamental reason: analysts use different analytical lenses and \nhence see different things, even when they are trying to understand the dynamics of the \nsame policy domain. \nThis article considers two general analytical lenses, or perspectives, that can be used to \nstudy global policy, which will be called the \u2018statecentric\u2019 and \u2018polycentric\u2019 lens. The \naim of the article is to highlight the respective assumptions of these perspectives and to \nreview some of the research questions and findings that resulted from them. The terms \n\u201canalytical lens\u201d and \u201cperspective\u201d (which are employed synonymously) are used to \nemphasise that statecentrism and polycentrism are not \u201ctheories\u201d, if theories are \nconceived as coherent sets of hypotheses about causal and constitutive relationships \nbetween phenomena. An analytical lens is rather a set of general assumptions, which \nform the basis on which a number of theories can be developed. Theories based on the \nsame statecentric or polycentric assumptions may well be pointing in opposite \n 2\ndirections: for instance, a statecentric theory that expects a ruthless struggle for survival \nand dominance among self-interested states is clearly different from a statecentric \ntheory that expects states to be deeply socialized in the respect for shared global norms. \nSimilarly, a polycentric theory that assigns to multinational corporations a structurally \ndominant role in the global system is clearly different from a polycentric theory that \nexpects a pluralistic balance of power between all kinds of nonstate actors. \nIt should be stated at the outset that the relationship between the two lenses is not \nconceived here as intrinsically competitive. In some cases it may be fruitful to contrast \ntheories derived from the two perspectives and compare their explanatory power in \nrelation to certain policy cases. But in other circumstances the two analytical lenses are \nbetter seen as complementary: each of them stimulates the analyst to ask questions and \nlook for entities and causal connections that the other lens may miss. In analogy to \nphysical lenses, each of them allows the observer to see some objects more sharply \nwhile at the same time blurring the context or cutting it out altogether. \nThe article consists of two main sections. The first section starts by outlining the key \nassumptions of the statecentric perspective with regard to the polity, the politics and the \npolicy dimensions of policy making.1 It then shows that this perspective has led analysts \nto focus on three broad areas of research: global policy competition, global policy \ncommunication, and global policy cooperation. Some exemplary studies conducted on \nthose research questions are mentioned. The second section outlines the key \nassumptions of the polycentric perspective, again with regard to the polity, the politics \nand the policy dimensions. It then discusses some emerging research agendas among \nanalysts using this perspective, notably the theme of the inclusiveness and public \naccountability of private and hybrid governance arrangements. The concluding section \noffers some thoughts on the relationship between the two lenses.  \n \n                                                 \n1 \u2018Polity\u2019 refers to the boundaries and basic institutional features of the policy-making unit; \n\u2018politics\u2019 refers to the process of interaction among actors and actor coalitions possessing \nvarious material and ideational resources and to the prevalent modes of interaction, such as \nfighting, arguing, bargaining and voting; \u2018policy\u2019 refers to the particular combination of goals \nand means \u2018selected\u2019 by the political process.    \n 3\n2. The statecentric perspective \n \n2.1 Assumptions \nAuthors using a statecentric perspective make a simple assumption with regard to the \npolity that is the object of analysis: it is the state. The policies under consideration are \nthus instances of \u2018public policy\u2019, to the extent that public policy is equated with policy \nmade by states, individually or collectively. (Section 3 considers this equation further). \nIn relation to the dimension of politics, the assumption is that it occurs in two separate \narenas: domestic and international. Domestic politics consists of the competition for \ninfluence on state policy making among groups variously organized as political parties, \nparty factions, pressure groups, judicial bodies, semi-independent public authorities, etc. \nDepending on the key institutional features of the polity, electoral politics plays a larger \nor smaller role in shaping policies, but it always interacts with other mechanisms and \nchannels of interest representation, such as corporatist arrangements, factional \nbargaining within parties, and contentious collective action. International politics, on the \nother hand, consists of interaction among governments, and it also can take a variety of \nforms: coercive diplomacy, bilateral and multilateral negotiations, reciprocal or \nunilateral policy adjustment, inclusion in and exclusion from policy arrangements, to \nmention just the most common. Domestic and international politics may be interpreted \nas functioning according to fundamentally different logics. For instance, a very \ninfluential approach in International Relations scholarship, structural Realism, is based \non the assumption that domestic politics is based on the political ordering principle of \nhierarchy whereas international politics is based on the political ordering principle of \nanarchy (Waltz, 1979). But the assumption of a fundamental qualitative difference \nbetween the two domains is not a necessary component of the statecentric view. What is \nnecessary is only that the two political domains are separate and that they are connected \nalmost exclusively through governments. In other words, there is an \u2018outside\u2019 and an \n\u2018inside\u2019 and governments are the only gatekeepers between them. \nOne example of a theory based on statecentric assumptions is \u2018liberal \nintergovernmentalism\u2019, which has been developed by Andrew Moravcsik (1998) and \nother authors, mostly with reference to European rather than global integration. Liberal \nintergovernmentalism combines a \u2018liberal\u2019 approach to the formation of state \n 4\npreferences (based on the issue-specific economic interests of powerful domestic \nconstituents) with a bargaining theory of international negotiations (based on the \nrelative power of states stemming from asymmetrical interdependence) and a functional \ntheory of institutional choice (based on the role of international institutions in increasing \nthe credibility of interstate commitments).   \nThe statecentric perspective has generated several research programmes that have \ngreatly enriched our understanding of the global dimensions of policy making. These \nresearch programmes have clustered around three themes that can be called \u2018global \npolicy competition\u2019, \u2018global policy communication\u2019, and \u2018global policy cooperation\u2019.2 \nThe order in which these themes are discussed in the remainder of this section reflects \nthe minimum levels of interaction \u2018density\u2019, and hence opportunities for \u2018socialization\u2019 \namong policy makers, which are required for the relevant causal mechanisms to operate. \nIn principle, competition requires very little interaction among decision-makers in \ndifferent countries to produce an effect on policy, as a \u2018natural\u2019 selection mechanism \nmay eliminate \u2018unsuccessful\u2019 policies and allow successful policies to survive and be \nreplicated. In practice, however, decisions about which policies to adopt or abandon are \noften made after ascertaining which policies are implemented in other countries. \nSimilarly, in principle communication may consist of the limited interaction involved in \ngathering information about foreign policy experiences, but in practice government \nofficials exchange information on a much more regularized and institutionalized basis. \nFinally, cooperation almost always requires extensive interaction during pre-agreement \nnegotiation and post-agreement verification of compliance. The following subsections \npresent some exemplary findings.     \n \n2.2. Global policy competition \nIn academic and public debates it is often remarked that states design regulative and \nredistributive policies in such as way as to strengthen the competiveness of \u2018domestic\u2019 \ncompanies in global markets and the attractiveness of their own jurisdiction as a \nlocation for investments. Once a government changes its policies to protect \u2018its\u2019 \n                                                 \n2 Because of space constraints, the article focuses on research on the interaction of policies and \nignores the impact of other processes, such as the transnational diffusion of new technologies or \npolicy-independent changes in the international flow of goods, services and capital. \n 5\ncompanies or to attract capital, this results in a \u2018policy externality\u2019 for other \ngovernments, who are under pressure to change their policies as well. According to \nsome authors, global competitive pressures are so strong that contemporary states have \nbecome \u2018competition states\u2019 (Cerny, 1997). Analysts often also predict the kind of \npolicies that competition promotes: a general convergence towards policies that \nminimise costs for companies exposed to foreign competition and for transitionally \nmobile economic actors. In other words, competition is said to produce a \u2018race to the \nbottom\u2019 (RTB). From the point of view of the governments, the equilibrium outcome is \nsuboptimal, since none gain any competitive advantage while their policies are more \n\u2018business-friendly\u2019 than they would otherwise be \u2013 a classic instance of a \u2018Prisoner\u2019s \nDilemma\u2019.  \nThe competitive regulation hypothesis has generated much theoretical and empirical \ncontroversy. With regard to environmental regulation, for instance, there is considerable \ndisagreement over the extent to which polluting industries relocate or expand in \nresponse to differences in regulatory stringency \u2013 the \u2018pollution heavens\u2019 hypothesis. \nWhile earlier research found no such effect, more recent research suggests that \ninvestment decisions are sensitive to differences in regulatory stringency, but the \nquestion is far from settled (Brunnermeier and Levinson, 2004; Spatareanu, 2007).  \nMore relevant for the purposes of this article is the question of whether governments \nperceive a problem of jurisdictional competition and change their policies in the \nexpectation that industries will respond accordingly. Some studies have found that \nexposure to competition affects the likelihood that certain policies are adopted. \nSimmons and Elkins (2004), for instance, examined 182 states from 1967 to 1996 and \nfound that countries were much more likely to adopt a liberal capital account policy if \ntheir direct competitors for capital had done so. In some cases, competition triggers \nreforms based on efficiency considerations. Thatcher (2007) found that regulatory \ncompetition was an important cause of the reform of French, German and Italian \nsectoral economic institutions in the areas of securities trading, telecommunications and \nairlines. Some of the extensive literature on the impact of globalization on the welfare \nstate finds that, in some circumstances, increased participation in international trade and \nfinance tends to reduce government spending and social welfare programmes (Brune \nand Garrett, 2005; Mosley, 2007).   \n 6\nOn the whole, however, scholars tend to be more impressed by the relative scarcity of \nempirical evidence supporting the RTB hypothesis. For instance, Flanagan (2006) \nanalyses data from a large sample of countries at various levels of economic \ndevelopment and finds no evidence that countries that are more open to international \ncompetition have weaker statutory labour protection. Holzinger et al. (2008), who \nexamined twenty-four industrialised countries between 1970 and 2000, attempt but fail \nto find a significant effect of bilateral trade openness on environmental policy \nconvergence.  \nThe logic of the RTB is intuitively compelling, and its empirical weakness calls for an \nexplanation. At least seven possible explanations can be advanced. Some of them are \nbased on the assumption that competitive pressures operate as posited, but that they are \noverridden by other factors. One explanation is that the global competitiveness of \ncompanies is only weakly affected by cross-national differences in environmental, \nlabour, social and fiscal policies, and that the stringency of regulation or the tax burden \nis not a major determinant of investment decisions. A second explanation is that \neconomic actors are sensitive to costs imposed by public policies, but many \ngovernments are held back from competitive regulation by domestic political and \ninstitutional constraints. Basinger and Hallerberg (2004) have presented a sustained \nargument to this effect in relation to tax competition. A third explanation suggests that \nthere is little evidence of regulatory competition because governments anticipate its \npossibility and prevent it through international regulatory cooperation. A fourth \nexplanation suggests that, in certain economic sectors, one or two countries have such a \ndominant position that they are unlikely to respond to competitive regulations enacted \nby lesser jurisdictions. Simmons (2001), for instance, argues that the market size and \nefficiency of U.S. financial services allowed the U.S. regulators to avoid a downward \ncompetitive spiral with foreign jurisdictions in financial market regulation. \nOther explanations for the lack of empirical evidence question or modify the internal \nlogic of the RTB hypothesis. A fifth explanation agrees that regulatory competition \nmatters and promotes policy convergence, but argues that it does not necessarily lead \ntowards less stringent standards. On the contrary, it can produce a \u2018race to the top\u2019. \nVogel (1995) famously noted that many U.S. states adopted California\u2019s more stringent \nautomobile emissions standards, since the benefits of accessing the Californian market \n 7\nwere large enough to justify a general improvement of standards. Vogel has called this \ndynamic the \u2018California effect\u2019, which forms the conceptual counterpart to the \n\u2018Delaware effect\u2019, named after the most eager participant in the competition among U.S. \nstates to offer business-friendly corporate chartering requirements. A sixth explanation \nmaintains that, if some countries start out better endowed than others with features that \nmake them attractive to investors, then capital mobility will increase rather than \ndecrease policy heterogeneity (Rogowski, 2003). Finally, the absence of clear evidence \nfor regulatory competition may be a result of the inadequate methodologies used to \ndetect it (for a discussion see Franzese and Hays, 2008). \n \n2.3. Global policy communication \nPolicies implemented abroad can be not only a source of externalities, but also a source \nof information. Policy makers often use information about experiences in other \ncountries in the process of designing or reviewing policies in their own jurisdiction. \nModes of communication and information transmission differ widely in terms of \nintensity, regularity and formalisation. At one extreme is the case of officials in national \nadministrations who learn about foreign experiences by means of publicly available \nsources and have no or little interaction with policy makers of the countries where those \nexperiences originated. An intermediate level of intensity, regularity and formalisation \nis represented by communication flows within transnational epistemic communities, \nwhich are usually defined as networks of professionals with recognised expertise in a \nparticular domain and who share normative beliefs, causal beliefs, notions of validity, \nand a common policy enterprise (Haas, 1992, p.3). Members of such epistemic \ncommunities provide information to policy makers or may be directly involved in \ndesigning regulatory policies. At the more institutionalised end of the transnational \ncommunication spectrum are formalised benchmarking and peer review exercises. \nProminent examples of transnational benchmarking exercises are OECD regulatory \nreviews, which started in 1998 and are based on self-reporting by national \nadministrations, assessments by OECD staff and peer review among members states \n(Lodge, 2005). The review process is entirely voluntary, since states are neither obliged \nto undergo a review nor obliged to implement the recommendations they receive. \n 8\nIf it is relatively easy to agree on what channels of communication are available to \npolicy-makers, there is more disagreement among scholars about which causal \nmechanisms are more likely to operate in cases of policy transfer. As a way of \nsummarising the mechanisms that have been highlighted in the literature it is useful to \nrefer to March and Olsen\u2019s (1989) distinction between the logic of consequentialism and \nthe logic of appropriateness and, as suggested by Risse (2000), to add \u2018arguing\u2019 and \ndeliberation as a distinct logic. An explanatory approach based on the logic of \nconsequentialism would assume that policy makers have clearly defined policy goals \nbut imperfect information about cause-effect relationships. Gathering information about \nforeign experiences is thus a rational way to improve the likelihood that policies are \ndesigned in such a way that they attain the intended goals, in a process of Bayesian \nlearning (Simmons et al., 2008. p.26).  \nBy contrast, explanatory approaches based on the logic of appropriateness focus on the \nsocial construction of norms of appropriate behaviour. The goals of the policy makers \nare not considered to be exogenous to the interaction with their foreign \u2018peers\u2019, but are \ndeveloped with reference to foreign models that are considered as \u2018legitimate\u2019 within \nthe reference group. Simmons et al. (2008) refer to this mechanism as emulation. In \nprinciple emulation can occur at a distance, but often it is the result of socialisation \nprocesses that take place through interaction within institutional contexts. In \ninternational relations, emulation has been examined in depth by the \u2018world polity\u2019 \napproach developed by John Meyer with numerous colleagues (e.g. Meyer et al., 1997). \nIn this version of sociological institutionalism, state officials orient their behaviour to \nglobal norms about what constitutes a legitimate polity and what goals it should \nlegitimately pursue. \nRisse (2000) suggests that the logic of arguing is distinct from both the logic of \nconsequentialism and the logic of appropriateness. Decision makers who adopt this \nlogic while interacting with one another do not aim merely at updating their knowledge \nabout cause-effect relationships, nor do they follow predetermined norms of appropriate \nbehaviour for a given situation, but are willing to modify their goals as a result of \npersuasion. While of course no real-world setting corresponds to the ideal situation \nidentified by discourse ethics theorists such as J\u00fcrgen Habermas (1981), a number of \nscholars maintain that certain transnational forums can and do function according to a \n 9\ndeliberative mode. Participants in these forums are seen as making a genuine effort to \nfind solutions that can be accepted by others on the basis of a process of mutual reason \ngiving and openness to learning about current best practices. Cohen and Sabel (2005) \ncall such settings \u2018deliberative polyarchy.\u2019 Slaughter (2004, pp.204-5) also argues that \n\u2018government networks\u2019 \u2013 among national regulators, judges or legislators \u2013 can meet the \nconditions required for open, genuine and productive discussion.  \nThere is some empirical evidence confirming the impact of transnational \ncommunication on regulatory policies. Raustiala (2002), for instance, discusses a \nnumber of cases in which US regulators successfully \u2018exported\u2019 their approaches in the \nareas of securities regulation, competition and antitrust law, and environmental policy. \nAs noted above, transnational communication may trigger both rational learning and \nnormative emulation, but estimating the relative importance of these mechanisms is a \ndifficult task for researchers. In an important study of government downsizing from \n1980 to 1997 among twenty-six OECD member countries, Lee and Strang (2006) found \nthat countries learn from each other but that this learning process is heavily influenced \nby prior \u2018theoretical\u2019 expectations. Reductions in government employment by a trade \npartner or neighbour lead to reductions in the size of the public sector, whereas \nincreases in government employment by the same partners or neighbours have \nnegligible effects. This suggests that downsizing is contagious but upsizing is not. \nCountries appear to be sensitive to evidence that downsizing works, since they tend to \nreduce public employment when recent downsizers experienced rapid growth and \nimproving trade balances and when recent upsizers faced slow growth and worsening \ntrade. But they do not react to information about strong economic performance by \nupsizers nor weak performance by downsizers. Lee and Strang (2006, p.904) conclude \nthat \u2018[e]mpirical outcomes that confirm expectations reinforce behavior, while outcomes \nthat contradict expectations are discounted. In short, when theories and evidence come \ninto conflict, theories win.\u2019  \nThe assessment of the importance of deliberative modes of communication has proven \neven more difficult than grasping processes of rational learning and emulation. Cohen \nand Sabel (2005) see elements of deliberative polyarchy especially in the institutions of \nthe European Union, but they detect embryonic forms of it also in global forums such as \nthe Codex Alimentarius Commission (CDC).  \n 10\n 2.4. Global policy cooperation \nA third way in which the global context can affect public policies is through cooperation, \ni.e. the commitment to implement certain policies in the context of agreements with \nother governments. International cooperation often consists of reciprocal commitments \nto harmonise policies across countries, but it can also consist of highly asymmetrical \nagreements, such as the promise to implement a structural adjustment programme in \norder to receive loans from the IMF. Studies on international policy cooperation tend to \nfocus either on the causes of international commitments or on their consequences, \nnotably whether and why governments comply with them and actually adjust their \npolicies (of course some approaches \u2013 notably rational-choice analyses \u2013 treat expected \nconsequences as causes). The causes of cooperation can be roughly divided into those \nrelated to transnational interdependencies and externalities and those related to domestic \npolitics. \nAmong those statecentric approaches to international cooperation that stress the role of \ntransnational interdependencies, rationalist institutional theory has been particularly \ninfluential since the early 1980s, and the following discussion will focus on it. 3  \nRationalist institutionalists want to explain when and how states succeed in cooperating \nfor mutual advantage despite international anarchy, i.e. the absence of a supranational \ngovernment capable to enforce agreements in the international sphere (e.g. Keohane, \n1984). The starting point of rationalist institutionalism is the existence of significant \nphysical or policy externalities which create a situation of strategic interdependence \namong governments. With the help of basic game-theoretical concepts, institutionalists \nidentified several types of strategic situations, among which the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma and \na coordination game known as Battle of the Sexes are particularly prominent. The Race-\nto-the-Bottom hypothesis, for instance, is often modelled as a Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma \ncaused by policy externalities. Genschel and Pl\u00fcmper (1997) apply this logic in their \nargument that the central banks of the world\u2019s main financial centres resorted to \nmultilateral action with regard to capital ratio requirements because keeping high \n                                                 \n3  For a broader survey including non-rationalist approaches see Koenig-Archibugi \n(forthcoming). \n 11\nstandards unilaterally might have undermined the international competitiveness of \nnational banks. A crucial tenet of institutionalism is that states can increase the \nlikelihood of successful cooperation by manipulating the informational context in which \nthey act, most notably by creating international institutions.  The basic idea on the link \nbetween cooperation problems and institutional arrangements is that \u2018form follows \nfunction\u2019.  Institutions can contribute to solving \u2018coordination\u2019 problems by providing a \nfavourable context for bargaining and, crucially, by presenting focal points to \nnegotiators. Examples of this function are many of the technical standards developed by \nthe International Organisation for Standardisation. The definition of common standards \nfor, say, the dimensions of freight containers may involve intense distributional \nconflicts, but the institution does not need an extensive monitoring mechanism since it \nis generally not in the interest of governments, port authorities and companies to deviate \nfrom the standard dimensions once they have been agreed. By contrast, institutions \ndealing with \u2018collaboration\u2019 problems, such as the Prisoners\u2019 Dilemma, must be \ndesigned in such a way that the incentive to defect from agreements is minimised:  to do \nso, they must help trust-building among states, define obligations and cheating, improve \nthe monitoring of compliance, and facilitate the decentralised sanctioning of cheaters. \nAn example is the decision to facilitate the monitoring and enforcement of intellectual \nproperty rights (IPR) protection by bringing IPR under the relatively robust dispute \nresolution mechanism of the GATT\/World Trade Organisation. \nThere is a lively debate among authors working within a statecentric rational-choice \napproach on various aspects of rational institutionalism. Authors such as Krasner (1991) \nand Simmons (2001), for instance, stress the importance of power asymmetries in \nshaping the process and the content of policy cooperation. One aspect of this is the \nattempt by states to shift the locus of negotiation and implementation to those \ninstitutions that are most likely to produce a distribution of gains that is particularly \nfavourable to them.  An example is the successful attempt by the U.S. and other states to \nshift international negotiations on the regulation of intellectual property rights from the \nWorld Intellectual Property Organisations to the WTO (Helfer, 2004).  A more inclusive \ninstitution in terms of membership can be the result of the capacity of a stronger state to \nremove the status quo from the set of options available to weaker states (Gruber, \n2000). With regard to the domain of banking regulation, Genschel and Pl\u00fcmper (1997) \n 12\nargue that, when in 1987 the British and U.S. regulators reached an agreement on a \ncommon capital adequacy standard and Japan joined it, all other member states of the \nBank for International Settlements had no choice but to join as well and agreement on a \ncommon standard was reached quickly. Simmons (2001) examined several cases of \nfinancial market regulation in the 1980s and 1990s and, consistent with her theoretical \nframework that stresses the autonomous nature of regulatory innovation in the dominant \nfinancial centre, she argues that most of the regulatory harmonisation resulted less from \nmutual adjustment than from unilateral decisions imposed by the United States.  \nAs noted above, the existence of transnational policy or physical externalities is not the \nonly reason why governments may choose to cooperate with one another. International \npolicy cooperation may be a rational response to constraints stemming from the \ndomestic politics of individual countries. If parliaments and executives often delegate \nregulatory authority to independent agencies to remove it from pressure-group politics \nand lengthen the time horizon of decisions, they may also be willing to shift regulatory \ntasks to international arenas in order to increase their policy influence vis-\u00e0-vis other \ndomestic actors or to make it more difficult for future governments to reverse policy \ndecisions made by the present government (Moravcsik, 1994). Governments sometimes \nfind that international cooperation is useful to gain influence in the domestic political \narena and to overcome internal opposition to their preferred policies, and in some \ncircumstances international governance may be the outcome of \u2018collusive delegation\u2019 \n(Koenig-Archibugi, 2004a). For instance, after controlling for other variables that may \nexplain the probability of entering into IMF arrangements, countries with a larger \nnumber of domestic veto players are more likely to enter an IMF programme (Vreeland, \n2007). This suggests that governments may want IMF conditions to be \u2018imposed\u2019 on \nthem in order to help them overcome domestic political constraints on economic reform. \nTo the extent that this mechanism reveals a political cleavage that cuts across state \nborders, however, it is more compatible with a polycentric than a statecentric \nperspective, as it is argued below. \nRecent rationalist institutional work has emphasised that, while the power of \ninternational organisations results from delegation of authority from member states, the \neffect of those organisations cannot be reduced to the interests of the states, given the \nsignificant potential for agency slack (see e.g. Hawkins et al., 2006). In addition to \n 13\nfruitful specific research questions, this emphasis has wider implications in terms of the \ngeneral analytical lens to be used to observe and explain global policy. Much more than \nwas the case in the first wave of rationalist institutionalism, international organizations \nemerge as distinct actors that, while constrained by their role as \u2018agents\u2019 of states, \npossess and pursue autonomous goals and resources in world politics. This signals that \nan extremely influential IR theory is replacing its statecentric lenses with polycentric \nlenses. \nIn sum, statecentric analyses have contributed greatly to our understanding of global \npolicy cooperation, but rationalist scholars are progressively abandoning the notion that \nsuch cooperation can be explained exclusively through statecentric lenses. The next \nsection explores the added value of using polycentric lenses. \n \n3. The polycentric perspective \n \n3.1. Assumptions \nThe statecentric perspective never lacked challengers, but since the end of the Cold War \nthere has been an increasing number of attempts to develop alternative conceptual \nframeworks.4 Jan Aart Scholte (2008, p.18) has recently listed some of the labels used \nto capture the nature of contemporary governance: \u2018plurilateralism,\u2019 \u2018polylateralism,\u2019 \n\u2018networked governance,\u2019 \u2018complex multilateralism,\u2019 \u2018empire,\u2019 \u2018new medievalism,\u2019 \n\u2018global issues networks,\u2019 \u2018cosmocracy,\u2019 \u2018mobius-web governance,\u2019 \u2018complex \nsovereignty,\u2019 and \u2018disaggregated world order.\u2019 Scholte himself has provided a \nparticularly clear elaboration of the idea that a fundamental change in the nature of \ngovernance is underway, which he conceptualizes in terms of six shifts: (a) from \ncountry units to what he calls \u2018transscalar spaces\u2019; (b) from state actors to multiple types \nof actors, such as local governments, regional institutions, global agencies, business \nconsortia and civil society associations; (c) from unitary states to states that are \ndisaggregated into multiple relatively autonomous policy decision points; (d) from \ncentralized decision-making to decision-making that is dispersed across multiple and \n                                                 \n4 On the broader debate about statism and territorialism in global politics see for instance \nAgnew and Corbridge (1995), Held et al. (1999), Krasner (1999) and Ferguson and Mansbach \n(2004). \n 14\ndiverse institutions and networks; (e) from discrete to overlapping jurisdictions; and (f) \nfrom sovereignty to a post-sovereign system of divided authority. Scholte summarizes \nthese shifts as an on-going transition from statist to polycentric governance (Scholte, \n2008, pp.13-19). \nIf polycentrism is seen as an analytical lens rather than as a mode of governance, it can \nbe described as resting on the following assumptions with regard to polity, policy and \npolitics. The polity to be analysed is not necessarily the state: in principle it can be any \nentity that is able to produce governance and formulate and implement policy. Rosenau, \nfor instance, argues that the study of global governance should focus on myriad \u2018spheres \nof authority\u2019 observable in the contemporary world, which may or may not be \ncoterminous with a bounded territory and are \u2018distinguished by the presence of actors \nwho can evoke compliance when exercising authority as they engage in the activities \nthat delineate the sphere\u2019 (Rosenau, 2006, p.117). Ferguson and Mansbach (2004, p.24) \nfocus on a set of somewhat more tightly delimited entities: \u2018Polities are collectivities \nwith a measure of identity, hierarchy, and capacity to mobilize followers for political \npurposes (that is, value satisfaction or relief from value deprivation).\u2019 Clearly these and \nother definitions to be found in the literature encompass a wide range of entities. Some \nauthors have attempted to manage conceptual complexity by developing typologies of \ngovernance-producing entities or polities. Koenig-Archibugi (2002), for instance, \nargues that governance arrangements can be seen as varying along three main \ndimensions \u2013 publicness, delegation and inclusiveness \u2013 and as conforming to a larger \nor smaller extent to eight ideal types. However, the key heuristic assumption of the \npolycentric perspective is that observers should remain open-minded as to where policy \nmaking may emerge and develop methodological tools that can identify and assess \ngovernance arising from unexpected sites. \nThe polycentric perspective does not assume a fundamentally different understanding of \npolitics than the statecentric perspective: it still can be interpreted as the process by \nwhich actors and coalitions of actors use material and ideational power resources to \nengage in cooperation, competition and conflict with one another, with the aim of \nbringing about policies that promote their interests and values. What is different is the \npattern of conflictual and cooperative interactions that the analyst expects to see, and \nspecifically the kinds of political cleavages that are possible and probable in global \n 15\npolitics. As noted above, the statecentric perspective assumes that societal cleavages \nwithin states determine the policy preferences of governments and then the resulting \ncleavages between governments generate patterns of international interaction, which \nmay be more or less competitive and cooperative. In other words, domestic preferences, \nbargaining power and institutions combine to generate state preferences over policies; \nthen state preferences, bargaining power and international institutions combine to \ngenerate international policy cooperation and competition. The polycentric perspective, \nby contrast, makes the crucial assumption that some important political cleavages cut \nacross state borders. Some issues pit coalitions composed of actors based in different \nstates, i.e. transnational coalitions, against other actors who are primarily based in a \nparticular state or who are themselves part of transnational coalitions. These actors can \nbe governments, other public bodies such as independent regulatory authorities, \ninternational bureaucracies, and various types of \u2018private\u2019 (i.e., nonstate) actors, such as \ncompanies and business associations, civil society organizations and social movements, \nepistemic communities. The following are some of the political cleavages revealed by \npolycentric lenses on global politics, which would be obscured by an exclusive reliance \non statecentric lenses.   \nA transnational coalition of private actors versus another private actor. Examples of \nthis cleavage are transnational networks of labour rights activists that span developed \nand developing countries and that put pressure on large companies, for instance by \npromoting consumer boycotts, in order to improve labour standards in those companies\u2019 \nglobal supply chains (Koenig-Archibugi, 2004a).     \nA transnational coalition of private actors versus a single government. Examples of this \ncleavage are campaigns by transnational human rights associations, such as Amnesty \nInternational, aimed at stopping the use of torture and other human rights violations by \nspecific governments (Risse et al., 1999). Other examples are transnational coalitions of \nenvironmentalists and indigenous peoples aimed at resisting tropical deforestation and \nother environmentally damaging government policies (Keck and Sikkink ,1998). Yet \nanother example of this type of cleavage are members of ethnic communities residing in \nvarious countries who mobilize politically against the governments of their \u2018home\u2019 \ncountry, as happened with parts of the Kurdish, Kosovar, and Tamil diasporas, who \n 16\nsupported political and armed opposition to the Turkish, Yugoslav and Sri Lankan \ngovernments respectively (Adamson, 2006).   \nA transnational coalition of governments versus a private actor. An example of this \ncleavage is the alliance between a reform-minded government and foreign governments, \noften through institutions such as the IMF, against domestic opponents of economic \nreform, e.g. on the issue of reduction of public spending (Koenig-Archibugi, 2004b). \nFor instance, Vreeland (2003) shows that in 1990 the Uruguayan president signed an \nagreement with the IMF mainly because he wanted IMF conditionality to be imposed, in \norder to help him overcome the resistance to economic reforms that was mounted by \nUruguayan trade unions, pensioners\u2019 organizations and the main opposition party. A \nrather different example of this cleavage is the collaboration of governments against \npirates, which considerably reduced the role of non-state violence in the past two \ncenturies but is still ongoing in some parts of the world (Thomson, 1994; Archibugi and \nChiarugi, 2009). \nA transnational coalition of sectoral state actors versus other sectoral state actors. As \nemphasised by Slaughter (2004) and Scholte (2008), different sectors of the state \u2013 such \nas ministries, regulators, judges, and parliamentarians \u2013 may not only have their distinct \ngoals, but also pursue these goals by collaborating with their counterparts in other \ncountries. A sectoral state actor may even enlist like-minded foreign counterparts or \ninternational agencies as allies in order to gain influence in negotiations with other \nsectors of its own state. For instance, in Somalia in 1984 the finance minister and other \neconomic ministers tried to use negotiations with the IMF on an extended loan \narrangement to promote economic liberalization against the opposition of party and \nmilitary members of the council of ministers (Kahler, 1993). Similarly, Pakistan\u2019s \nfinance minister is said to have \u2018specifically requested the managing director of the IMF \nto include in the routine surveillance report on his country a reference to the need to cut \nmilitary expenditures\u2019 (Pauly 1997, cited by Vreeland, 2007, p.65). These and other \nexamples show that state actors may engage in international collusion not only against \nprivate actors but also against other sectors of their own state. \nA transnational coalition of private actors versus another transnational coalition of \nprivate actors. Following the call of the founders of the European labour movements \n(\u2018workers of all lands, unite!\u2019), transnational union organizations are increasingly \n 17\nengaged in cross-border campaigns against, and collective bargaining with, \ntransnational companies and their subsidiaries, which often results in \u2018international \nframework agreements\u2019 (Bronfenbrenner, 2007). Capital-labour interaction is formally \ninstitutionalized in the International Labour Organization, where labour representatives \nfrom 183 countries negotiate with employers\u2019 representatives and government delegates \nto create and monitor international labour standards (Haas, 1964). \nA transnational coalition of private actors against a transnational coalition of \ngovernments. An example is the collaboration between like-minded terrorist groups \naimed at destabilizing and influencing governments, and the collective action taken by \nthose governments with regard to intelligence sharing, restrictions of financial \ntransactions, political pressure, and military intervention against terrorist networks. \nPerhaps most interesting of all is the most complex constellation: a transnational \ncoalition of private and state actors versus another transnational coalition of private \nand state actors. One example of this cleavage is the conflict between actors promoting \nstricter tobacco control and those opposing it since the 1990s. The broad pro-regulation \ncoalition was institutionalized in bodies such as the Policy Strategy Advisory \nCommittee of the Tobacco Free Initiative, which was set up by the World Health \nOrganization and included representatives from the World Bank, Unicef, World Self \nMedication Industry, International Nongovernmental Coalition Against Tobacco, the \nCampaign for Tobacco Free Kids, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. The anti-regulation coalition included the world\u2019s main tobacco companies, \nand various governments joined the anti-regulation or the pro-regulation coalition \nduring the negotiation process that led to the Framework Convention on Tobacco \nControl (Collin et al., 2002; Yach et al., 2006). Another example is the campaign \npromoted by the Coalition for an International Criminal Court (CICC), to which over \n800 organizations adhered. The CICC included most of the 237 NGOs officially \naccredited at the 1998 Rome conference on the international criminal court and played a \nmajor role in spurring and supporting pro-court governments in their difficult \nnegotiations with those governments that preferred a weak court or no court at all \n(Glasius, 2006).  \nThese examples illustrate patterns of conflict and cooperation that cut across state \nboundaries and require polycentric analytical lenses to be identified. This does not mean \n 18\nthat cross-cutting political dynamics are more important than situations in which \ndomestic political processes are distinct from international processes and governments \nact as gatekeepers between the two domains (e.g. governments aggregate domestic \npreferences on trade policy and negotiate with one another on that basis). The relative \nplausibility of statecentric and polycentric explanations is an empirical question that \nneeds to be ascertained case by case. But a case can be made that analysts should start \nby employing the wider perspective, i.e. polycentric lenses, and avoid exclusive reliance \non research designs that make it difficult to capture cross-cutting dynamics, such as the \ncommon use of a country as unit of quantitative analysis (\u2018methodological statism\u2019). \nPolycentric assumptions about policy stem directly from the preceding argument. To the \nextent that analysts are interested in the policies that result from important political \nprocesses and are likely to be consequential, they should not limit themselves to \nexamining \u2018public policy\u2019, if this expression is taken to be equivalent to \u2018state policy\u2019. \nHowever, this is not the only possible interpretation of \u2018public policy\u2019. Terry Macdonald, \nfor instance, has suggested that \u2018power should be designated as \u2018public\u2019 and subject to \ndemocratic control whenever it impacts in some problematic way upon the capacity of a \ngroup of individuals to lead autonomous lives\u2019 (Macdonald, 2008, p.35, emphasis \nremoved). By extension, public policy might be defined as policy that has that kind of \neffect on individual lives. Examining whether this conceptual shift would bring real \nanalytical advantages is however beyond the scope of this article.   \n    \n 19\n3.2. Research agendas \nAs has been argued above, the statecentric perspective to the global dimensions of \npolicy has generated a set of clearly defined lines of enquiry that allow a fruitful \ninteraction between progressively refined hypotheses and the accumulation of evidence. \nFor instance, the assumption of the state as the basic unit of analysis facilitated the \ncreation of databases that made possible sophisticated statistical analyses of \ninternational competition, communication and cooperation. The polycentric perspective \nhas not yet matched those achievements, in part because research programmes in this \ntradition cannot rely on a predefined unit of analysis, but must devote considerable \nattention and energy to the definition and empirical identification of their \u2018objects\u2019.  \nResearchers have identified a large number of areas where transnational non-statist \ngovernance arrangements create and implement policies, either of a regulative or an \nallocative kind: environmental management systems, carbon trading, sustainable \nforestry, maritime transport, online commerce, financial transactions involving swaps \nand derivatives, jurisprudence, accounting standards, credit rating, technical product \nstandards, development aid, health services, labour standards, arms control (landmines), \n\u2018fair\u2019 trade, medical research, commercial arbitration, to name only some of the most \nprominent areas.5 In addition to pursuing the general aim of identifying the variety of \ngovernance arrangements that produce policy in particular domains, analysts using \npolycentric lenses also ask questions on the causes and the consequences of non-state \npolicy making. \nResearch on the causes often proceeds from the question of why policy making in a \nparticular area is dominated by non-state actors rather than state actors, or vice versa. \nAn aspect of this question is whether that predominance is stable or whether (and why) \nthere has been a shift from one policy making mode to the other. Broadly speaking, \ninterpretations tend to be located somewhere between a societal and a statist pole. \nAccording to the societal intepretation, public\/intergovernmental governance emerges \nwhen and where there is demand from powerful private actors, and it is designed to \nserve their interests. According to the statist interpretation, private\/transnational \n                                                 \n5  A small selection of studies on these governance arrangements is: Cutler et al., 1999; \nBraithwaite and Drahos, 2000; Ronit and Schneider, 2000; Falkner, 2003; Slaughter, 2004; \nKoenig-Archibugi and Z\u00fcrn, 2006; Vogel, 2009. \n 20\ngovernance emerges when and where it is stimulated by powerful states, and it is \ndesigned to serve their interests. An example of a societal explanation is provided by \nMugge (2006). He assumes that the choice is determined mainly by the demands of \nproducers located in key jurisdictions, since usually regulators will be most sensitive to \ntheir preferences. He argues that the choice between private and public regulation in a \nparticular economic sector depends on the intensity of the competition among the main \ncompanies in that sector. If the competitive struggle is intense, the market incumbents \nwill support public regulation as a means to stave off the challengers. If those struggles \nhave settled and the population of companies is stabilised, the companies in the sector \nconcerned will prefer and achieve transnational private regulation. According to Mugge, \nthe case of derivative listings illustrates the first scenario, while the Eurobond market \nillustrates the case of a stable population of incumbent companies that banded together \nto fend off public governance. \nTo be sure, polycentric analysts stress that the choice is not simply between statist and \nnon-statist governance. They point out that civil society \norganisations, companies, national public agencies and intergovernmental organisations \noften form what have been called \u2018multistakeholder\u2019 policy networks that seek to agree \non consensual policy solutions for specific sectors. For instance, the Kimberley Process \non diamonds from conflict zones created a hybrid regulatory framework that combines \nan intergovernmental regime, which sets standards on the import and export of rough \ndiamonds and the tracking of illicit diamonds, and a self-regulatory system that obliges \ncompanies to adopt stringent standards with regard to purchases and sales of diamonds \nand jewellery containing diamonds, including independent monitoring (Kantz, 2007). \nThe Kimberley Process is a prominent example of a transnational regulatory regime that \noriginated from an NGO campaign and from the response by industry and governments \n\u2013 in this case the market-leading De Beers Corporation and the South African \ngovernment, which were concerned about possible consumer reactions triggered by the \ncampaign. Polycentric analysts are interested in why the policy response to the problem \nof conflict diamonds took this hybrid institutional form.  \nPolycentric research also investigates the consequences of non-statist arrangements on \npolicy. One research agenda focuses on the policy process. For instance, Porter and \nRonit (2006) examine the different stages of the policy process in private self-regulation \n 21\nand highlight the similarities and differences in relation to the corresponding stage in \npublic policy processes. Another research agenda focuses on the policy output. It is \noften argued that private \u2018self-regulation\u2019 is mainly a way to prevent public regulation \nand thus the standards emerging by non-state policy can be expected to be less strict \nthan those that would emerge from a public policy process, all else being equal. For \ninstance, Kolk et al. (1999) compared 132 codes of corporate conduct created by four \ndifferent types of actors - individual companies,  business associations, social interest \ngroups, and international organizations \u2013 and find that codes issued by business  \nassociations have the weakest scores with regard to focus, measurability and compliance \nmechanisms.  \nAn important line of research examines the consequences of polycentric policy making \nfor democracy. One common position is that polycentrism is inherently unable to ensure \nthe degree of inclusiveness and participation that genuinely democratic governance \nrequires (e.g. Marchetti, 2008). Other analysts maintain that democratic forms of \nauthorization and accountability can in principle be realized in non-state governance \narrangements, even if existing instances still fall short of democratic criteria (e.g. \nMacdonald and Macdonald, 2006; Macdonald, 2008, Scholte, 2008). One important \ndimension is the ability of transnational civil society to promote new forms of \ndemocratic politics (Della Porta 2009). Several  theoretical and empirical contributions \nmake this bundle of issues one of the most interesting areas of investigation within the \nbroader polycentric research programme.6\n \n4. Conclusion \nA vast amount of research has been conducted on the global dimensions of policy and \nthere are reasons to believe that research in this field will grow at a faster rather than \nslower rate in the next few years. Scholars, and even more so policy makers, may find it \nincreasingly difficult to absorb all the findings that may be relevant to their areas of \ninterest. As a result, they may be tempted to focus their attention on clusters of research \nthat share similar ontological and methodological assumptions. This article has \n                                                 \n6 A small selection: B\u00f6rzel and Risse, 2005; Held and Koenig-Archibugi, 2005; Papadopoulos, \n2007; Dingwerth, 2007; Meidinger, 2008; Koenig-Archibugi 2010.  \n 22\nillustrated some reasons why such a temptation should be resisted. Statecentric lenses \non global policy have generated a wealth of significant and policy-relevant findings. \nThis is due not only to the undeniable substantive importance of states as authors of \npolicy and as targets for other policy-seeking actors, but also to the methodological \nadvantages of using states as predefined units of analysis. Polycentric lenses on global \npolicy, on the other hand, have revealed policy making entities, political cleavages, and \npolicy outcomes that would have been obscured by an exclusive reliance on statecentric \nassumptions. Recent progress in devising theoretical and methodological tools for the \nanalysis of non-statist governance suggests that this perspective may one day match the \nachievements of statecentric analyses.  \nIs it possible and desirable to aim for some form of theoretical integration of statecentric \nand polycentric perspectives? As stressed in the introduction, statecentrism and \npolycentrism are not theories in themselves, but rather clusters of assumptions about \npolity, politics and policy that may constitute the basis for a range of different theories. \nIt is likely that many analysts adopt certain assumptions not because of a deep-seated \nbelief in their ontological \u2018truth\u2019, but because they capture empirical situations well \nenough to possess heuristic value and provide certain methodological advantages, such \nas well-defined \u2018units\u2019 of analysis and availability of corresponding datasets. In other \nwords, in the practice of global policy studies often ontology follows methodology, \nrather than the other way round. But the fact that commitments to certain assumptions \nmay more pragmatic than substantial raises the question of whether attempts at \ntheoretical integration may be a particularly promising route to make further progress in \nglobal policy analysis.  \nJupille, Caporaso and Checkel (2003) identified four \u201cmodels of theoretical dialogue\u201d in \npolitical science: competitive testing; additive theory based on complementary domains \nof application; sequencing of theories; and subsumption. While competitive testing \ncannot be considered a form of synthesis, determining domains of application and \nsequencing are two synthetic strategies based on complementarity, and subsumption is a \nform of synthesis that interprets one theory as a special case of another. Since \nstatecentrism and polycentrism are not theories, these models cannot be applied directly \n 23\nto them.7 However, it is possible to consider some examples of dialogue in the light of \nthe two analytical lenses. Drezner (2007) performs a \u2018competitive test\u2019 of explanations \nof regulatory outcomes, some of which stress the role of global civil society and others \nthat stress how state power is used to promote domestic interests. He analyses regulation \nin the field of the internet, financial markets, genetically modified foods and intellectual \nproperty and concludes that, if their domestic politics allows great powers to agree \namong themselves, then global regulatory coordination will occur regardless of the \nsupport or opposition of transnational NGOs, IGOs and peripheral states. At most, \nNGOs can play a marginal role as lobbyists, protestors, monitors of compliance, and \ndelegated standard-setters. What is notable for our purposes is that, while Drezner finds \nempirical support for a \u2018statist\u2019 theory, he reaches that conclusion by using analytical \nlenses that are at least partially polycentric, since otherwise comparing the influence of \nstate and transnational nonstate actors would make little sense. \n A related attempt at theoretical dialogue was made in the classic book by Robert \nKeohane and Joseph Nye, Jr, Power and Interdependence (1977). They presented their \nanalytical constructs \u2018realism\u2019 and \u2018complex interdependence\u2019 as ideal types to which \nconditions in the real world may resemble more or less. One of the differences between \nthe two ideal types is that in complex interdependence multiple channels of contact \nconnect societies (i.e. states do not monopolize those contacts), which is compatible \nwith polycentric assumptions. Keohane and Nye\u2019s case studies implement a form of \ncompetitive testing and show, for instance, that negotiations over the law of the seas \ncame closer to complex interdependence than negotiations over international finance. \nThese findings can be seen as supporting a synthesis based on the \u2018domains of \napplication\u2019 model, which tries to determine under which conditions one or the other \ntheory is more plausible. As with Drezner, the possibility of such a synthesis depends \non using polycentric lenses, if only to discover that complex interdependence is \nempirically weak in many contexts. A final example: Rosenau (1990, pp.97-98) argued \nthat \u2018[t]he universe of global politics had come to consist of two interactive worlds with \noverlapping memberships: a multicentric world of diverse, relatively equal actors, and a \n                                                 \n7 For an example of how different models of dialogue can be applied to the relationship between \ntwo theories see Andreatta and Koenig-Archibugi (2010).   \n 24\nstate-centric world in which national actors are still primary.\u2019 Also in this case the \npossibility of \u2018seeing\u2019 both worlds depends on the use of polycentric lenses. \n In sum: it often makes sense to subject to competitive testing theories that \nemphasise the influence of transnational nonstate actors on policy and theories that \ndiscount it; and it is often fruitful to try to define the respective domains of application \nof those theories. But both exercises depend on a prior adoption of polycentric lenses. \nProgress in global policy studies is thus likely to derive from a specific form of \nsynthesis, namely the subsumption of statecentrism under polycentrism. Such a \nsynthesis would be based on the awareness that the preponderance of states in global \npolicy making would be a special case of a situation in which several types of actors are \ncapable to create and implement policy; and that the political cleavages considered by \nstatecentric studies (domestic cleavages on the one hand and international cleavages on \nthe other) can be seen as a subset of the political cleavages that can occur according to \nthe polycentric perspective. But this is a long term project. Until such a synthesis is \nachieved, the fruits of both perspectives deserve the full attention of scholars and policy \nmakers interested in making global policy more responsive to the needs of the world\u2019s \npopulation and more legitimate in its eyes. \n 25\n References \n \nAdamson, F.
