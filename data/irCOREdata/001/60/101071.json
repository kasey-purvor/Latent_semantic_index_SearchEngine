Despite significant progress in reducing\nthe threshold current densities \u0001Jth\u0002 or improving the tem-\nperature stability,1,2 intrinsic quantum dot \u0001QD\u0002 lasers emit-\nting around 1.3 \u0001m have yet to meet their full potential. This\nis attributed to many factors such as inhomogeneous broad-\nening or size dispersion of the dots and dominating nonradi-\native recombination at room temperature \u0001RT\u0002 which in-\ncreases Jth and its sensitivity to temperature variations.3,4 It\nhas been proposed that p-doping the devices and thus satu-\nrating the levels in the valence band with holes would greatly\nimprove the device performance by increasing the gain and\nthe bandwidth.5,6 Although the effect of p-doping shows ma-\njor improvements on the temperature sensitivity and the\nbandwidth of the devices,7 measurements do not show a\nclear enhancement of the gain for a given injection8 as it is\nexpected from theory.5,6 Recent results reported that the su-\nperior thermal stability of InAs\/GaAs p-doped QD lasers\naround room temperature arises from a combination of im-\nproving thermal distribution of the electrons, leading to a\ndecrease in the radiative current necessary to reach the lasing\nthreshold, and an increase in nonradiative Auger recombina-\ntion with temperature, together giving rise to a constant\nthreshold current over a limited temperature range.4 In this\nwork, we consider the temperature sensitivity of the gain and\nspecifically, the effect of the nonthermal distribution of the\ncarriers on the gain characteristics of p-doped devices and\ncompare the results to those obtained with intrinsic quantum\ndot lasers.\nThe gain was measured using the method described by\nHakki and Paoli9 at both room temperature, where carriers in\nthe intrinsic devices are in thermal equilibrium, and at\n350 K, where carriers in the p-doped lasers are expected to\nbe closer to thermal equilibrium.4 The lasing wavelength of\nthe devices was approximately 1.28 \u0001m at room tempera-\nture. The active region consisted of ten stacked InAs dot-in-\na-well layers separated by either modulation p-doped or in-\ntrinsic GaAs barriers sandwiched by GaAs waveguide and\nAlGaAs cladding layers. The chips were driven with 50 \u0001s\nlong pulses at a duty cycle of 50%. These pulses were long\nenough to avoid transient mode-hopping effects. The laser\nsubstrate temperature was kept constant using a thermoelec-\ntric heater\/cooler and temperature controller. A Glan-\nThompson prism polarizer was used to discriminate TE and\nTM modes and only a small degree of polarization cross-talk\nwas observed. Its effect on the gain is negligible, and the\nerror is only found to be significant for measurements made\nat transparency \u00b15 cm\u22121.\nFigure 1 shows the variation of the peak net modal gain\n\u0001g=\u0002G\u2212\u0003i\u0002 as a function of the current density for both\nmaterials at room temperature, \u0002 being the confinement fac-\ntor and \u0003i the internal loss. 500 \u0001m long cavities were used\nto measure the gain at low injections \u0001g\u000420 cm\u22121\u0002 and\n300 \u0001m long cavities \u0001g\u000513 cm\u22121\u0002 for both undoped and\np-doped devices.

As one can see in Fig. 1, the peak net gain\nof the p-doped device is less than that for the intrinsic device\nat low injection. This is clearly illustrated by the fact\nthat device transparency \u0001where g=0 cm\u22121\u0002 is reached\nat current densities J\u0005200 and \u0005450 A cm\u22122 in the intrinsic\nand p-doped lasers, respectively. At higher injection\n\u0001J\u00051300 A cm\u22122\u0002 the ground state \u0001GS\u0002 of the p-doped de-\nvices achieves more gain than the intrinsic devices which\nsaturates at 26 cm\u22121. These observations are explained by the\nfact that at RT, the intrinsic devices are at thermal\nequilibrium,3,4 the dots are coupled, and the carriers prefer-\nentially occupy the larger dots, or lower energies. As a result,\nthey more efficiently take part in the gain process, resulting\nin a high peak gain for a given current. However, the GS\nsaturates at lower injection current and relatively low peak\nnet gain. The excited state \u0001ES\u0002 reaches transparency when\nthe GS starts saturating, further demonstrating the thermal\ndistribution of the carriers.\nIn the p-doped devices, due to the increased barrier\nheight for the electrons induced by the trapped holes \u0001liber-\nated from the ionized acceptors\u0002, the electrons are not ther-\nmally distributed among the dots and do not necessarily oc-\ncupy the ground state of the larger dots at room\ntemperature.4,7 This is confirmed by comparing the pinning\nabove threshold of the total spontaneous emission \u0001L\u0002 and\nGS spontaneous emission versus current. They are measured\nby integrating the pure spontaneous emission spectra col-\nlected through a window milled in the substrate contact of\nthe devices.4 At 100 K none of the L and GS emissions pin\nabove the threshold current because of the nonthermal distri-\nbution of the electrons. At 300 K, the undoped lasers are in\nthermal equilibrium and hence the L and GS emissions both\npin above Ith. However, the L and GS emissions of the\np-doped laser are still not fully pinned at 370 K. The peak\nnet gain is therefore reduced compared to the intrinsic mate-\nrials due to a broader nonthermal carrier distribution. We find\nthat the full width at half maximum of the pure spontaneous\nemission from the GS measured from a window milled in the\nsubstrate contact of lasers is much greater in the p-doped\ndevices at 100 K \u000155 and 45 meV in the doped and undoped\ndevices for J\u0005100 A\/cm2\u0002 and is still slightly higher at RT\n\u000143 and 40 meV in the doped and undoped devices for\nJ\u0005100 A\/cm2\u0002, confirming the idea of a broader carrier dis-\ntribution in the p-doped QDs. The peak net gain for the\np-doped devices is therefore reduced compared to what is\nexpected at thermal equilibrium. However, the doping in-\ncreases the hole population in the dots, preventing gain satu-\nration at low injection and allowing higher peak net gain at\nhigh currents. The emission from the first excited state in the\np-doped devices is consequently reduced at low injection\nlevels and could not be observed in our measurements. The\nincreased carrier density required to achieve a fixed gain\n\u0001prior to saturation\u0002 will tend to exacerbate Auger recombi-\nnation in the p-type devices. Furthermore, the p-type doping\nis likely to increase the nonradiative Auger recombination\npresent in these devices4 at low current densities due to the\nincreased hole concentration which would further lower the\ndifferential gain \u0001dg \/dJ\u0002.\nAt 350 K for both devices, the fraction of injected cur-\nrent going into nonradiative recombination processes is\ngreater than at room temperature;4 dg \/dJ is therefore re-\nduced compared to that at RT. The net modal gain was mea-\nsured using a 300 \u0001m cavity device at this temperature for\nboth undoped and p-doped materials. As can be seen in Fig.\n2, at 350 K, transparency and gain saturation are reached at\nlower injection in the intrinsic devices. However, three sig-\nnificant differences are noticeable: both materials tend to-\nward more similar behavior at 350 K, the peak gain saturates\nat a lower value, and the first excited state can be observed in\nthe p-doped devices at low peak gain. At 350 K, the peak net\ngain of the p-doped material is less than that of the undoped\nmaterial until J\u00051750 A cm\u22122; however, the difference is\nless than that at room temperature. This is likely to be due to\nthe improved carrier redistribution but shows that the\np-doped devices have not fully reached thermal equilibrium\neven at 350 K. This is further supported by the fact that the\ntransparency carrier density remains slightly higher for the\np-doped devices at 350 K, since in thermal equilibrium, the\np-doped devices would have a lower transparency carrier\ndensity than the undoped devices. Furthermore, the effect of\ndoping becomes less at higher temperatures, further reducing\nthe difference between both device types at 350 K.4 The\nlower values of the saturated net gain compared to room\ntemperature measurements could be explained by an increase\nin the internal losses as we observed from efficiency mea-\nsurements. This suggests that intervalence band absorption\ncould play a significant role at high temperatures, as has\npreviously been observed in quantum well devices at this\nwavelength.10 Reports also suggest that homogeneous broad-\nening could play a significant role when the temperature\nincreases.11 However, we are not yet able to determine which\nof these two effects dominates.\nBecause the gain at which the devices saturate is low-\nered at 350 K, the importance played by the first excited\nstate at higher temperatures is increased. This is clearly illus-\ntrated in the p-doped devices where the ES was absent in the\nRT measurements up to the very high current densities where\nthe GS peak gain almost reaches its maximum value of\n30 cm\u22121. However, at 350 K, the ES is observable in the gain\nspectra and the transparency for this state is reached at a\npeak gain of about 17 cm\u22121.\nTo conclude, the gain of both undoped and p-doped\nquantum dot lasers was studied at room temperature and high\ntemperature \u0001350 K\u0002. p-doping successfully reduces gain\nsaturation. However, we find that the peak gain of the\np-doped devices is less than that of the undoped devices at\nthe temperatures studied due to the nonthermal distribution\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 Peak net gain vs current density at 350 K.\n191118-2 Mass\u00e9 et al.

This coupled with Auger re-\ncombination results in a higher absolute value of current den-\nsity at transparency in the p-doped devices and in a lower\ndifferential gain. At 350 K, the p-doped devices are still not\ncompletely at thermal equilibrium, but the interdot carrier\ntransport is improved compared to RT. This results in more\nsimilar behavior of the peak net gain for both device types.\nWe also find that at high temperatures, the peak net gain is\nsignificantly reduced, which may be due to increased homo-\ngeneous broadening and\/or optical losses either of which\nmay place an intrinsic limit on the performance of quantum\ndot devices at high temperatures.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the EPSRC \u0001U.K.\u0002\nand the Nuffield Foundation \u0001NAL\/00695\/G\u0002 for supporting\nthis work and also wish to thank A.
