The superheating magnetic field of a type II superconductor is examined, using the\ntime-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations and the methods of formal asymptotics. The supercon-\nducting solution in a halfspace is found to exist only for magnetic fields lower than some critical\nvalue where there is a folding over of the solution branch. A linear stability analysis is performed\nboth in one and two dimensions, giving differing criteria for stability. Finally, superheating fields for\nmore general geometries are considered, and in particular the case of a sine-wave perturbation of a\nhalfspace is examined.\nKey words, superconductivity, Ginzburg-Landau equations, superheating field\nAMS subject classifications. 82D55\n1. Introduction. This paper is concerned with the response of a superconduct-\ning material to an externally imposed magnetic field. This response is most conve-\nniently described by Fig. 1, which shows the preferred state of the superconductor as\na function of Ho, the applied magnetic field, and , a material parameter (known as\nthe Ginzburg-Landau parameter) which determines the type of superconducting ma-\nterial; < 1\/x\/ describes what is known as a type I superconductor, and > 1\/\ndescribes what is known as a type II superconductor.\nFor type I superconductors there is a critical magnetic field Hc (known as the\nthermodynamic critical field) below which the material will be in the superconducting\nstate but above which it will revert to the normally conducting (normal) state. The\ntransition between normal and superconducting states as the applied magnetic field\nis raised or lowered through Hc takes place by means of phase boundaries separating\nnormal regions from superconducting regions sweeping through the material and is\ndescribed in [7], [10], and [17].\nFor type II superconductors a third state exists, which is known as the mixed\nstate. The mixed state, as its name suggests, is neither wholly superconducting nor\nwholly normal but consists of many normal filaments embedded in a superconducting\nmatrix. Each of these filaments carries with it a quantised amount of magnetic flux\nand is circled by a vortex of superconducting current; thus these filaments are of-\nten known as vortices. The transition from the normal state to the mixed state takes\nplace via a bifurcation as the magnetic field is lowered through some critical value\n(known as the upper critical field) and is described in [1], [6], [8], [9], [18], [21], and\nThis bifurcation is subcritical for type I superconductors but supercritical for type II\nsuperconductors, hence the observation of the mixed state only for type II supercon-\nductors. There is a mutual repulsion between superconducting vortices, which leads to\nthe formation of a hexagonal lattice of vortices in the mixed state, as observed in [12].\nThe transition between superconducting and mixed states is less well studied\nmathematically, and this will be the subject of the present paper. The critical field\nHc plotted in Fig. 1 (known as the lower critical field) is calculated on the basis of\nan energy argument; it is the field at which the energy of the wholly superconducting\nsolution becomes equal to the energy of the single vortex solution for an infinite\nReceived by the editors August 30, 1993; accepted for publication (in revised form) September\n6, 1994.\nMathematical Institute, University of Oxford, 24-29 St. Giles\u2019, Oxford OX1 3LB, United\nKingdom.\n1233\n1234 S.

In fact, as H0 is raised, there is a barrier to the generation of vortices\nin a superconductor, and there exists a \"superheating field\" Hsh such that for He1 <\nHo < Hsh the superconducting solution is still locally stable, even though it is not the\nglobal minimum energy solution. We will find that the response of a superconductor\nis different in two dimensions than in one dimension, leading to a different value of\nH,h from that obtained by de Gennes [14], Matricon and Saint-James [20], and Fink\n[13]. We note that Bean and Livingston have also calculated approximate surface\nbarrier fields, using an energy argument [3]. The approach we adopt is via the time-\ndependent Ginzburg-Landau equations (to be introduced in the next section) and\nagain leads to a different result.\nThe results we obtain do agree with that obtained for a halfspace by Kramer\n[19], who uses the steady-state Ginzburg-Landau equations with the positivity of the\nsecond variation of the free energy being the criterion for stability. We will see that the\npresent approach allows the superheating field of an arbitrary body to be calculated,\nincluding the site of first instability.\n2. The Ginzburg-Landau model. For a more complete introduction to the\nGinzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity the reader is referred to [10] and [11]\nand the references therein. Here we merely state the dimensionless, time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau equations as\niA)2(1) c -1) in\n( ) (*V V*)+IIA ina+v +\nIn fact, there is also a \"supercooling field,\" Hsc, such that for fields Hsc < Ho < Hcl vortices\nwithin the superconductor will remain trapped, even though the global minimum energy solution is\nthat of a completely superconducting sample with no vortices. This will be the subject of another\npaper.\nSUPERHEATING FIELD OF TYPE II SUPERCONDUCTORS 1235\nwhere ft is the region occupied by the superconducting sample, is the (complex)\nsuperconducting order parameter (which can be thought of as a kind of macroscopic\nwavefunction for the superconducting electrons), and A and q5 are the (real) magnetic\nvector potential and the electric scalar potential, respectively, which are such that\nOA(3) H curl A, E Ot\nA is unique up to the addition of a gradient; once A is given, b is unique up to\nthe addition of a function of t. Here a is a positive material constant, and is\nthe Ginzburg-Landau parameter mentioned in the introduction; we see that is a\nratio of the typical lengthscale for variations of the vector potential (known as the\npenetration depth, which has been used as the lengthscale in nondimensionalising the\nequations) to the typical lengthscale for variations in the order parameter (known as\nthe coherence length).\nIn the steady state, with q5 0, these equations result from minimising the\nGinzburg-Landau formulation of the Gibbs free energy [15],\n2\n\/ H -2H. Ho + -Vt iAtP dV,\nwhere H0 is the applied magnetic field. In the time-dependent case they can be\nobtained as a limiting case of the microscopic BCS equations [2], [16].\nWe will be concerned only with two-dimensional situations in which the magnetic\nfield is perpendicular to the plane of interest. In this case H (O, O, H(z, y, t)),\nA= (Al(x, y, t),A2(z, y, t), O), and the boundary conditions appropriate to (1), (2)\nare\n(4) n-(V-iA)tP 0 on Oft,\n(5) H H0 on Oft,\nwhere rt is the unit outward normal to the boundary.\nIn the units we are using the thermodynamical critical field is given by Hc 1\/\/,\nthe upper critical field is given by Hc.

We examine the solution of the\nGinzburg-Landau equations for the halfspace x > 0 as the applied external magnetic\nfield is increased. We consider the case of an extreme type II superconductor by\nsetting 1\/ and considering the limit as e\n--\n0. In one dimension the gauge may\nbe chosen so that is in fact real and A (0, A(x), 0).

Because of\nthe small parameter multiplying the derivative of f in equation (14), we expect there\nto be a boundary layer at x 0.\nOuter solution. We formally expand the outer variables (which we denote by\nthe subscript o) in powers of e:\n() fo f(o) + f(o) +...,\n(20) Qo Q(o) -+- eQ(o1) +...,\n(21) Ho H(o) +H(o1) +....\nSubstituting the expansions (19)-(21) into equations (14), (15) and equating powers\nof e yield at leading order\n(22)\n(23)\nIf fo() 0, then\no (f(o)) f(o) + f(o)(Q(o))\n(Q(o0)),, (f(oO)).Q(oO).\n(fo()) 2 1 -(Q(o)) 2.\nSubstituting this into (23) gives\n() ((o))\" (o0)_ ((o0))\nwith solution\n(25) Q(o) 2v\/ aex1 + a2e2\"\nSUPERHEATING FIELD OF TYPE II SUPERCONDUCTORS 1237\nTherefore\n(26) Ho() 2x\/aeX(1 a2e2x)(1 + a2e2X)2\nThis completes the leading-order outer solution, once we have determined the constant\na. Strictly speaking, because of the boundary layer at x 0, the boundary condition\n(18) should not be applied directly to (26); rather a should be determined by matching\nwith the inner solution. However, when we define the inner variable X by z eX\nand expand in powers of e as in (19)-(21) in the boundary layer, it is not dimcult\nto show that Qi and Hi are constant to leading order (where the subscript denotes\nthe inner solution), and hence H}) H0, QI) b, say (the boundary layer simply\nserving to take the derivative of f down to zero).

This corresponds either to considering\nmodes in which the initial perturbation of A and is small or to a situation in which\nc is large so that A relaxes instantly on the timescale of variations in .

We have shown that the superconducting solution becomes unstable at a\ncertain value of the magnetic field, which we then define as the superheating magnetic\nfield. We have not shown that this instability leads to the formation of vortices and\nthe mixed state, though we would conjecture that it does. This remains an interesting\nopen problem.\nRemark. Bean and Livingston calculate the superheating field by considering the\nenergy of a vortex line near a sample surface. They find that for distances close to the\nsurface the energy increases with increasing distance, while for distances further away\nthe energy decreases with increasing distance. Thus, they conclude, a vortex placed\nsufficiently close to the sample surface will be sucked out of the surface, while one far\nenough away will move into the interior of the sample. This is the \"surface barrier\"\nto vortex penetration. The superheating field that they calculate is the magnetic field\nat which the critical distance from the boundary is of the same order as the vortex\ncore. The actual field obtained depends upon the details of the vortex core; they use\na \"cutoff\" calculation which leads to a value of Hc\/. This differs from the present\ncalculation by the factor of V\/10\/9, or 1.05.\nThis definition of the superheating field is unsatisfactory for the following reasons.\nFirst, the true value of the superheating field can only be calculated by a careful\nanalysis of a vortex whose distance from the boundary is the same order as its core\nradius (i.e., O(1\/t)). The arguments used by Bean and Livingston can only give the\norder of magnitude of the superheating field. Second, a vortex near the boundary\nis a major perturbation to the superconducting solution, and it may be that the\nsuperconducting solution is locally stable, even though any vortices that happened to\nbe generated would move into the sample.\nAn analysis of the type indicated above is needed, though, to show that any\nvortices generated by the instability we have found do actually make their way into\nthe sample. This also remains an interesting open problem.\nRemark. Often in the limit as\n--\noc in the Ginzburg-Landau equations a dif-\nferent scaling of the parameter c is chosen, which corresponds to the present c e-2.\nThis means that the timescale for relaxation of the magnetic field is much shorter than\nthe timescale for relaxation of the order parameter, rather than the two timescales\nbeing comparable as above. Adopting this different scaling of c makes the long-wave\nstability calculation a little more tedious, though it does not alter the result. The\nshort-wave stability calculation is the same, since the magnetic field simply relaxes\ninstantly on the relevant timescale, as indicated above.\nRemark. Note that the stability of long-wavelength perturbations is governed\nby the time derivative of the potential A, whereas the stability of short-wavelength\nperturbations is governed by the time derivative of the order parameter . This is\nbecause A varies on an order one scale, while can vary on an O(1\/) scale. For\nlong-wave perturbations A is the dominant variable and the solution is stable, while\nfor short-wavelength perturbations, once A relaxes, has a chance to dominate and\ngenerate the instability. Note also that when k 0, so that the perturbation is a\nfunction of x only, then cr < 0. These modes were not accounted for in our earlier\nstability analysis in one dimension. However, since they are decaying, the conclusions\nwe came to still hold.\n5. Superheating fields for sample geometries other than the slab. Since\nthe instability mentioned above occurs on an 0() lengthscale and not an 0(1) length-\nscale, we can now calculate the superheating field for any specimen shape in which\nSUPERHEATING FIELD OF TYPE II SUPERCONDUCTORS 1251\nthe boundary varies slowly on the inner lengthscale. In such cases the stability is\ndetermined simply by the magnitude of the outer solution.\nBecause of the gauge-invariance property (6), it is not really the vector potential\nA but the gauge-invariant potential Q A- eVX, where X is the phase of the order\nparameter , which is important. For the halfspace X 0, but in general it may\nnot be.\nIf we solve the outer problem for Q, we know that the solution will be unstable\nat any point at which the magnitude of Q is greater than 1\/x\/-, without needing to\ndo the stability calculation again. In the steady state, the outer problem is given by\n(92) -(curl)2Q- (1-IQI)Q\n(93) Q. n 0 on Oft,\n(94) curl Q H0 on Oft.\nin\nTwo geometries in which this problem reduces to an ordinary differential equation\nare the film -d < z < d, in which case Q (0, Q(z), 0),\n(95) Q,, =Q_Q3,\n(96) Q\u2019(+d) Ho,\nwhere _= d\/dx, and the circular cylinder r < R, in which case Q Q(r)O,\n(97) Q\" Q Q\n. \/.2\n(98) Q\u2019 (R) + Q(R) HoR\n(99) Q(O) bounded,\nwhere d\/dr and 0 is the unit vector in the azimuthal direction. The superheating\nfields for these two geometries are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively.\nWe can get an idea of how the shape of the boundary affects the superheating\nfield by considering perturbations of the slab and cylindrical geometries. We consider\nhere a halfspace with a slowly varying, small-amplitude sine-wave perturbation of\nthe boundary. Here the wavelength of the perturbation has to be >> e (so that the\nboundary is still planar in the boundary layer expansion). The amplitude of the\nperturbation should be << 1 but >> e, since we will calculate a series expansion in\npowers of it while neglecting terms of order e in our original expansion.\nWe consider the domain x > 5 sin ky, << 5 << 1.

JONATHAN CHAPMAN\nthan or less than zero. It is not difficult to show that g(0) must be less than zero.\nHowever, QI(0) is positive, and so we need to work harder to determine the sign of w.\nEven in this simplified form the problem (118)-(120) is still difficult. We simplify\nit further by considering the limits of small and large wavenumber k.\nSmall wavenumber.

Thus v is increasing initially, and we have v > 0 in a neighbourhood of\nthe origin. Suppose there is a first point x0 such that v\"(xo) 0. Then w(zo) O,\nwhich implies V(Xo) -0(x0) < 0, contradicting the minimality of x0. Hence v\" > 0\nfor all z, and v cannot satisfy the boundary condition at infinity. Thus a cannot be\npositive; i.e., wl(0) <_ 0. From (117) we see that this implies that Qlis increased in\nplaces on the boundary where sin ky is positive (since Q(0) < 0), and therefore it is\nat these points that the instability will first occur, as shown in Fig. 6. Note that the\neffect on the superheating field of the boundary perturbation is O(k2) for small k.\nLarge wavenumber. The limit of large wavenumber in (118)-(120) is a singular\nperturbation problem, since the coefficient of w\" tends to zero as k\n-\noo. Thus we\nexpect that there will be a boundary layer at x 0. Indeed, if we naively let k tend\nto infinity, then the leading-order behaviour of w is\n(Q(1 Q))\u2019\n1 3Q\nwhich does not satisfy the boundary condition at x 0.\nSUPERHEATING FIELD OF TYPE II SUPERCONDUCTORS 1255\nVACUUM ( SUPERCONDUCTOR\nFIG. 6.

Thus, as for small wavenumber, Qlis increased in places on the\nboundary where sin ky is positive. Thus for large wavenumber the instability will also\nfirst occur at the places shown in Fig. 6. Note that the effect on the superheating field\nof the boundary perturbation is O(k4\/a) for large k. Thus small-wavelength pertur-\nbations have a much stronger effect on the superheating field than long-wavelength\nperturbations.\nFigure 7 shows a numerical calculation of w(0) plotted against wavenumber k.\nMoving back to the general situation, we can reformulate the outer problem (92)-\n(94) in terms of the variables which are of primary interest, namely, the magnetic field\nH and the square magnitude of the potential Q, which we will call u.

Is the first point at which u equals 1\/3 always on the\nboundary? Since 1\/3 is relatively small compared to unity, one way of approaching\nthis problem would be to perform an asymptotic expansion in powers u. The leading-\norder magnetic field would then satisfy\n(140)\n(141)\n72H(0) H() 0 in\nH() H0 on cgf.\nThe leading-order u is then given by u() =1 VH()12. The error in the leading-\norder solution should be of the order of (u())2, or about 10%. Of course, it can\nbe improved upon if we compute higher terms in the expansion. These terms will\neach satisfy inhomogeneous versions of the modified Helmholz equation, with known\nright-hand sides.\nThe leading-order approximation for a slab is\nH() Hoe-x.\nThis gives the leading-order superheating field as Hsh 1\/v\/ 0.577, which is about\n10% larger than the true value of 0.527.\n6. Comparison with experiment. We compare the superheating field Hsh\n0.745Hc calculated in 4 with the available experimental data.\nBoato et al. [5] perform superheating experiments by applying an axial alternating\nmagnetic field to a cylindrical sample with radius approximately equal to 4 ,k. They\nfind that the field at which the first vortex enters the sample is 190 Gauss. The alloy\nfilament they use has a value of about 8, and a thermodynamic field of 275 Gauss.\nThus they find Hsh 0.69Hc.\nDe Blois and De Sorbo [4] use a larger sample with 4, H 1360 Oe. They\nfind a superheating fields varying along the length of the specimen from 750 Oe to 1400\nOe, corresponding to 0.55 H to 1.03 H. In another sample with 4, H 310\nOe. Then the average superheating field was 245 Oe and, after the next electropolish,\n235 Oe, corresponding to 0.79 Hc and 0.76 H, respectively.\nQuantitative experimental data for other geometries is harder to come by, but\nthere does seem to be at least qualitative agreement with the theory presented. For\nexample, for rectangular samples vortices were first nucleated in the middle of the\nlongest side, while for more irregular shapes interior angles were the preferred nucle-\nation sites [24].\n7. Conclusion. We have examined the solution of the Ginzburg-Landau equa-\ntions for a halfspace in the limit as the Ginzburg-Landau parameter\n-\nx. We find\nthat there is a folding over of the response diagram so that as the applied magnetic\nfield is increased beyond the value at the nose the solution must jump to another\nbranch. This is the superheating field calculated by de Gennes [14].\nAn examination of the linear stability of the solution with respect to one-dimen-\nsional perturbations revealed that the higher of the two solution branches was indeed\nstable until the nose was reached, while the lower of the two solution branches was\nunstable. However, on examining the linear stability of the solution with respect to\ntwo-dimensional perturbations we found that it became unstable to short-wavelength\nperturbations at a lower value of the applied magnetic field, namely, Hsh v\/-H\/3,\nwhich is therefore the true superheating field. This value agrees with that obtained\n1258 S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN\nby Kramer in [19] but is different from that obtained by Bean and Livingston in [3]\n(although the difference is only 5%). It agrees well with experimental observations.\nFinally, we examined the superheating field for geometries other than a halfspace.\nWe found that for sine-wave perturbations of a halfspace, the instability first sets in\nat the troughs rather than at the peaks of the perturbation, i.e., at points on the\nboundary with the largest negative curvature. The general problem of calculating the\nsuperheating fields for an arbitrary domain (37)-(39) remains an interesting open\nquestion.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A. A.
