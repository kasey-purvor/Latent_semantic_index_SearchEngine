INTRODUCTION \nA number of fibre optic methods for on-line monitoring of the cure of epoxy resins have been reported [1]. They offer \nclear advantages over traditional monitoring techniques, due to their inherently small dimensions and compatibility with \nfibre reinforced plastics. Typically, the optical fibre is used as the means of delivering the light to and from a sample, e.g. \nspectroscopic methods [1-3]. Utilising the fibre as an evanescent wave sensing element has also been reported using \nfluorescence [4-6]. Direct interaction of the propagating mode with the surrounding environment, is often exploited, \nachieved by etching or side polishing the optical fibre to remove the cladding and thus expose the evanescent tail of the \ncore mode field [7]. Techniques that do not require removal of the fibre cladding and hence retain their mechanical \nintegrity are useful in applications requiring embedding of the optical fibre, such as the monitoring of the cure of \ncomposite materials. In-fibre grating structures are capable of coupling light from the core of the fibre into the cladding, \nwhere the interaction of the cladding modes with the external environment enables the measurement of the surrounding \nrefractive index without the need for etching or side polishing of the fibre. Two in-fibre grating structures which act as \ncore to cladding mode couplers are considered here, the long period grating (LPG) and the tilted fibre Bragg grating \n(TFBG). An LPG produces a discrete set of attenuation bands in the transmission spectrum of the optical fibre [8]. The \nrefractive index sensitivity of LPGs has been exploited for a wide range of applications, including, chemical \nconcentration sensing [9], liquid level sensing [10] and as a means of forming a tuneable spectral filter [11]. A TFBG \nproduces numerous resonances in the transmission spectrum of the optical fibre, the monitoring of which has been used \nto demonstrate a refractometer [12]. A Fresnel based refractometer is used to evaluate the sensors and the results are \nbriefly compared with two traditional cure monitoring methods, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and impedance \nspectroscopy. \n \n* r.p.tatam@cranfield.ac.uk; phone: +44 (0)1234 754630; fax: +44 (0)1234 750728; www.cranfield.ac.uk\/soe\/cpoe  \n \n \nSPIE Europe Optical Metrology,  June 17-21, 2007, Munich, Germany \n \n \n \n1.1 Long Period Gratings \nA long period grating (LPG) consists of a periodic refractive index modulation of the core of an optical fibre. The period \nof the modulation is typically in the range 100 \u00b5m to 1000 \u00b5m, and supports coupling between co-propagating modes of \nthe optical fibre. In the case of single mode fibre, the coupling takes place between the guided mode and co-propagating \ncladding modes. Efficient coupling is possible to only a subset of these cladding modes [8]. As the cladding is a poor \nwaveguide, the modes are lossy and the transmission spectrum of an optical fibre containing an LPG contains a number \nof attenuation bands, each corresponding to coupling to a different cladding mode. The phase matching wavelengths are \ngoverned by the expression [13], \n \n( ) ( )[ ]\u039b\u2212= \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb i cleffncoeffni __  ( 1 ) \n \nwhere \u03bbi, neff_co, nieff_cl and \u039b are the ith cladding mode resonance wavelength, effective index of the core, effective index \nof the ith cladding mode, and the grating period respectively. The refractive index sensitivity of LPGs arises from the \ndependence of the coupling wavelength upon the effective index of the cladding mode. The response of an LPG to \nrefractive index is evident as a shift in the central wavelength of the attenuation bands; this is shown in figure 1. The \nhigher order modes show an increased sensitivity, and this is enhanced as the refractive index approaches that of the \ncladding. When the refractive index matches that of the cladding, the cladding modes are no longer supported as the \ncladding appears to be of infinite thickness. Further increase of the refractive index leads to the bands reappearing, \ncorresponding to the existence of leaky modes, but at a longer wavelength and with significantly reduced refractive index \nsensitivity [13]. \n \n1.38 1.40 1.42 1.44 1.46 1.48 1.50 1.52 1.54 1.56 1.58 1.60 1.62\n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\nW\nav\nel\nen\ngt\nh \nSh\nift \n(n\nm\n)\nR.I.\n-30.0\n-25.0\n-20.0\n-15.0\n-10.0\n-5.0\n0.0\n5.0\n1.38 1.42 1.46 1.50 1.54 1.58 1.62\nIndex of refraction\nW\nav\nel\nen\ngt\nh \nsh\nift\n (n\nm\n)\n \nFigure 1.

The \nrefractive index at the wavelength of operation was calculated using the Sellmeier equation. The wavelength response \nwas then fitted with a 6th order polynomial to provide a function relating wavelength shift to refractive index. \n1.2 Tilted Fibre Bragg Gratings \nA standard fibre Bragg grating (FBG) consists of a refractive index modulation in the core of an optical fibre  that acts to \ncouple the fundamental forward propagating core mode to the contra-propagating core mode. A tilted FBG (TFBG) [14, \n15] consists of a refractive index modulation that is purposely tilted or blazed relative to the fibre axis in order to \nenhance coupling between the forward-propagating core mode and contra-propagating cladding modes, as illustrated in \n \n \nSPIE Europe Optical Metrology,  June 17-21, 2007, Munich, Germany \n \n \n \nfigure 2. The contra-propagating cladding modes are poorly guided and attenuate rapidly and are therefore not noticeable \nin reflection but are observed as numerous resonant bands in the transmission spectrum of the TFBG. A typical \ntransmission spectrum is shown in figure 3. \nThe spectral response of the TFBG is governed by the phase matching condition: \n( ) B B_ _ , cosin ni eff co eff cl where\u03bb \u03b8= + \u22c5 \u039b\u039b \u039b =\n \n( 2 ) \nwhere \u03bbi, neff_co, nieff_cl, \u03b8, \u039b\uf020 and \u039bB are the ith cladding mode resonance wavelength, effective index of the core, effective \nindex of the ith cladding mode, tilt angle, grating period and blaze period respectively. \n \n \n \n0.88\n0.92\n0.96\n1\n1.04\n1.08\n1.12\n1542.5 1547.5 1552.5 1557.5 1562.5 1567.5\nWavelength (nm)\nTr\nan\nsm\nis\nsi\non\n (a\n.u\n.)\n \nFigure 3.

The dotted line indicates the position of the Bragg wavelength. The shaded \narea illustrates the envelope technique used for area calculation. \n \nThe TFBG spectral resonances are more complex and require a different method of analysis compared to that of the \nLPG. One method by which this may be achieved is by constructing an envelope that completely surrounds the spectral \nresonances [12]. The area that is enclosed by the envelope varies with changes in the refractive index of the surrounding \nenvironment. By monitoring this change and relating it to the refractive index it is possible to use the TFBG as a \nrefractometer. The TFBG response to changes in surrounding refractive index, shown in figure 4, was characterised by \nimmersing the section of fibre containing the TFBG in a series of Cargille refractive index oils of differing refractive \nindex. The refractive index at the wavelength of operation was calculated using the Sellmeier equation. The wavelength \nresponse was then fitted with a 3rd order polynomial, relating wavelength shift to refractive index. \n \n\u03b8 \nCladding \nmode \n\u039bB \u039b \nCore \nCladding \n \nFigure 2.

Normalised area of the envelope of the TFBG resonances (with reference to that when the TFBG is in \nair) plotted as a function of the refractive index of the surrounding medium. \n \nIn this paper, the use of LPGs and TFBGs as resin cure monitoring sensors is investigated. The index of refraction of a \npolymerising resin changes as the molecular density increases and as the atomic bonds involved in the polymerisation \nprocesses are altered [16]. The sensitivities of TFBGs and LPGs to changes in refractive index are exploited with the aim \nof developing a method of measuring the degree of cure. To aid cross comparison of results, a Fresnel reflection based \nrefractometer has been designed and implemented [17]. The resin cure is characterised further using traditional \ntechniques of cure monitoring; differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and impedance spectroscopy. These are \ncompared with the grating methods described above. As a further extension of the LPG technique, preliminary results are \nalso shown utilising the LPG sensor as a Fresnel based refractometer. This may indicate the possible use of LPGs with \nresin systems of refractive indices greater than that of the sensing fibre. \n2. EXPERIMENT \nA TFBG of length 5mm and blaze angle 4.5\u00b0 was fabricated in boron-germanium co-doped optical fibre, Fibercore \nPS1250 with a cut-off wavelength of 1240nm, using the near-field interference pattern of a tilted phase-mask. The \nphotosensitivity of the fibre was enhanced by pressurizing it in hydrogen for a period of 2 weeks at a pressure of 150bar \nat room temperature. The phase mask was illuminated with a UV beam at a wavelength of 248nm and with an average \npower of 40mW. The TFBG was interrogated by coupling the output from a super-luminescent diode of bandwidth 60nm \ninto the optical fibre, and monitoring the transmission using a scanning fibre Fabry-Perot interferometer of free spectral \nrange 43nm and of finesse 900 [18].  \nTo investigate the LPG\u2019s response to the refractive index change of the resin at different wavelengths, LPGs of length \n40mm and 400\u00b5m period were fabricated in two different fibre types,  one with a cut off wavelength of 650nm \n(Fibercore SM750) and the other with a cut off of 1275nm (Optical Fibres 1310). The fibre was photosensitised by \npressurising it in hydrogen for a period of 2 weeks at a pressure of 150bar at room temperature. The fibre was then \nplaced behind an amplitude mask that was illuminated by a UV laser beam at a wavelength of 266nm, provided by a \nfrequency-quadrupled Nd:YAG laser.  \nThe transmission spectrum of the fibre with the shorter cut-off wavelength, shown in figure 5, was monitored by \ncoupling the output from a tungsten-halogen white light source into the fibre and coupling the transmitted light to a CCD \nspectrometer (Ocean Optics S2000) with a resolution of 0.3nm. The transmission spectrum of the fibre with the longer \ncut-off wavelength was monitored using an Advantest Q8381 spectrum analyser with a resolution of 0.1nm. \n \n \n \nSPIE Europe Optical Metrology,  June 17-21, 2007, Munich, Germany \n \n \n \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n840 880 920 960 1000 1040 1080\nWavelength (nm)\nTr\nan\nsm\nis\nsi\non\n (%\n)\n \nFigure 5. Transmission spectrum of an LPG of length 40mm and of period of 400\u00b5m, fabricated in an optical fibre \nwith a cut-off wavelength of 650nm (Fibercore SM750). \n \nThe responses of the fibre grating based refractometers to the refractive index change were compared with refractive \nindex measurements made using a Fresnel based refractometer [17]. Two Fresnel refractometers were constructed, \noperating at wavelengths of 833nm and 1575nm. This was to aid correlation with the wavelength regions used by the \nfibre gratings and to reduce the differences introduced by the dispersion of the resin. The Fresnel approach is \ncomplementary to the grating sensors in offering a highly localised measurement of the refractive index change at the \nend of a fibre that can be readily calibrated, as described below. However, this approach is not as appropriate for \napplications where multiplexing of several sensors is required, or where a longer gauge length sensor is necessary.  \n2.1 Fresnel Refractometer \nThe experimental configuration is shown in figure 6. The output from a laser diode operating at the appropriate \nwavelength was intensity modulated at a frequency of 270Hz, and coupled into a network of 3dB directional couplers. \nThe Fresnel reflection from the fibre\/resin interface was monitored using photodiode pd1. In the second arm, photodiode \npd2 monitored the reflection from the air\/fibre interface, acting as an intensity reference to aid the normalisation of the \nsignal and to account for any change in power coupled into the optical fibre from the laser diode. The outputs from the \nphotodiodes were monitored using lock-in amplifiers. To minimize contributions from unwanted Fresnel reflections from \nthe unused port of the 3dB coupler, micro bends were induced in the fibre to form a high attenuation return path for the \nreflections.  \nThe refractive index determined using the refractometer is given by [17] \n1\n_ 1\nRn neff co\nR\n\u2206\u2212\n= \u00d7 \u2206+\n \n( 3 ) \n_\n_\nn neff co a\nn neff co a\n\u2212\u2206 = +\n \n( 4 ) \nepoxyV\nairVR =\n \n( 5 ) \nwhere, neff_co is the effective refractive index of the fibre mode, na is the refractive index of air given as 1.0002739 [17], \nVair is the voltage produced by photodiode pd2, obtained for the reflection from the fibre\/air interface and Vepoxy is the \nvoltage produced by photodiode pd1, corresponding to the reflection from the fibre\/resin interface. \n \n \nSPIE Europe Optical Metrology,  June 17-21, 2007, Munich, Germany \n \n \n \n A UV cured epoxy resin, EpoTek OG134, with an uncured refractive index of 1.4163, measured at 589nm [19], was \nused as the test resin. A UV lamp, with output power 4W  and with a spectral peak at 365nm, was positioned to provide a \nfluence of 6.57mW\/cm2 in order to cure the resin slowly and to allow the reaction to be recorded using the relatively low \nsampling rate achievable using the OSA. The LPG and TFBG spectra and the reflection signal from the Fresnel probe \nwere recorded at 0.5s intervals during the cure. \n \n2.2 Differential scanning calorimetry and impedance spectroscopy \nTo assess how indicative the refractive index change during cure was to the resins cure state it was necessary to compare \nthe results with standard assessment techniques. Two methods were investigated, differential scanning calorimetry \n(DSC) and impedance spectroscopy. \nDSC is a widely used technique in the materials industry for investigating the characteristics of polymers. It is a method \nthat measures the heat flow absorbed or emitted by the sample. In the case of thermosetting curing, the heat flow is \nproportional to the rate of reaction [20].  Normalisation and integration of the heat flow versus time curve using an \nappropriate baseline [21] yields the degree-of-cure evolution with time. A sample was prepared using the PTFE well and \nUV cured at a constant temperature of 29\u00b0C in a TA Instruments 2920 MDSC with an RCS cooling unit. The resin was \nirradiated under the same conditions as the refractometry experiments. \nImpedance spectroscopy is proposed as an online method for monitoring a polymer during cure [22, 23]. It is based on \nchanges in the electrical and dielectric properties as a polymer cure progresses. The molecular structure of a material \nundergoes significant change during cure and the material goes through phase transitions in the cure cycle, i.e. liquid to \nrubber to glass. Much information can be derived from impedance measurements but for the purposes of on line \nmonitoring in a control context it is necessary to relate a dielectric parameter directly to a material state index. In this \nexperiment the imaginary impedance maximum (IIM) is used as a dielectric parameter to asses the cure state of the \nepoxy under cure. A sample was prepared and interrogated using a Solartron Instruments 1260 frequency response \nanalyzer over a frequency range, with a GIA (Pearson Panke) interdigitated dielectric sensor. The analysis proposed in \n[18] was followed to assess the cure progression from the impedance data. As for the refractometry experiments, the \nresin was irradiated under the same conditions. \n3. RESULTS \nFigure 7 shows the refractive index of the curing resin measured by both of the Fresnel based refractometers (solid line - \n833nm and dashed line - 1575nm).

An exothermic peak is evident shortly after the UV lamp \nwas turned on. \n \nA simple model was used to predict the expected wavelength shift of an LPG band in response the refractive change \nduring cure. The model uses Gloge\u2019s weakly guiding approximation [24] to calculate the effective refractive index of the \ncore mode. The standard dispersion equation for a step index fibre [25] was used to calculate the effective indices of the \ncladding modes. The central wavelengths of the attenuation bands may then be determined using equation (1). The \nrefractive index measured during the cure of the resin using the Fresnel system was then input to the model to calculate \nthe corresponding change in the cladding mode effective index, and thus allow prediction of the change in the LPG \nattenuation band wavelength. Figure 9 shows the predicted shift of the central wavelength of the longest wavelength (5th) \nattenuation band of an LPG fabricated in the lower cut-off wavelength fibre, of length 40mm and with a 400\u00b5m period. \nShown here also is the experimentally measured response of an LPG of the same design.

Figure 10 shows the refractive index calculated using the fifth attenuation bands of both LPGs (SM750 and \nOF1310 fibre). At both wavelengths the initial decrease in refractive index, observed when the UV lamp is switched on, \nis followed by a rapid positive change in refractive index. The LPGs show a decrease in the rate of change of refractive \nindex after 90 minutes, in agreement with the measurements made using the Fresnel refractometer. The discrepancies \nmay be attributed to dispersion effects and to errors induced in the calibration, where the thermo-optic change in \nrefractive index of the resin was assumed to be negligible. The results obtained using both the Fresnel technique and the \nLPG based method indicates that the onset of the positive refractive index change is delayed when the measurement is \nmade at the longer wavelength. This may point to the dispersive properties of the resin. The refractive index of the resin \nat the shorter wavelengths (~800nm) approaches the high sensitivity regions of the refractometers before that of the \nlonger wavelengths (~1550nm). \n \n1.400\n1.405\n1.410\n1.415\n1.420\n1.425\n1.430\n1.435\n1.440\n1.445\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180\nTime (mins)\nIn\nde\nx \nof\n re\nfra\nct\nio\nn\n \nFigure 10.

At indices higher \nthan that of the cladding, the wavelength response is shown to be significantly reduced. This places a requirement on the \nfibre design; that the fibre index must closely match the index of the resin system. Most structural resin systems however \nhave a refractive index that is higher than that of standard silica optical fibre. Here, to extend the measurement range to \nrefractive indices higher than that of the cladding, we propose to exploit the refractive index dependence of the \nextinction ratio of the LPG attenuation bands to the external refractive index. \nFor surrounding indices higher than that of the cladding, propagating cladding modes are no longer supported. However, \nleaky modes associated with Fresnel reflection at the glass\/surround interface are evident as attenuation bands with a \nslightly longer wavelength and a reduced extinction ratio. These attenuation bands show a very weak wavelength \nsensitivity to changes in the surrounding index greater than that of the cladding but the extinction ratios have been shown \nto increase as the surrounding refractive index increases beyond that of the cladding [13]. The preliminary results for an \nisothermal cure of an epoxy with an initial uncured refractive index of 1.53 are shown in figure 13. The resin was \nisothermally cured at 180\u00b0C over two hours. The refractive index change during cure was calculated using the Fresnel \nrefractometry method, discussed in section 2.1. The change in extinction ratio of the LPG attenuation band shows good \ncorrelation with the measured change in refractive index. The Fresnel signal is noisy during the early stages of the cure, \nwhich may be a result of volatiles degassing from the sample. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the use of an LPG \nas a cure sensor for resins with a high refractive index. The use of LPGs in standard silica fibre may also be employed as \nresin location sensors in a composite component, where the change in the extinction ratio of an attenuation band may be \nindicative of the presence of resin.  \n3.5\n4\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n6\n6.5\n7\n7.5\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180\nTime (mins)\nM\nax\nim\num\n lo\ng \n[Z\n\" (\noh\nm\n)]\n1.409\n1.414\n1.419\n1.424\n1.429\n1.434\n1.439\nIn\nde\nx \nof\n re\nfra\nct\nio\nn\n \nFigure 13.

SUMMARY \nIn summary, optical fibre refractometers have been employed to monitor the refractive index changes occurring in a \ncuring epoxy resin. The core-cladding mode coupling resonances of a tilted fibre Bragg grating (TFBG) and of an LPG \nhave been shown to be sensitive to the cure of an epoxy resin. The measurements made using the grating refractometers \nwere compared with those made using a fibre optic Fresnel reflection based technique, and were found to be in \nagreement to within 6 x 10-4 rius. The grating based refractometers are sensitive to temperature and strain, which must \nbe decoupled to accurately measure refractive index. The results are also compared with traditional cure monitoring \ntechniques and show close agreement. This leads to the possibility of using the sensors with cure-kinetic models to \ncharacterise and monitor the cure of resins and fibre reinforced resin systems [26]. The change in extinction ratio of LPG \nbands to high index resins may also provide a method for monitoring the cure of resins. \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support for this work from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research \nCouncil (EPSRC), UK.  \nREFERENCES \n1.
