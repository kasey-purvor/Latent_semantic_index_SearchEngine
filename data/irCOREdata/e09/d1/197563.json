Provenance as a Filtering and Framing Device in the \nQualification of Wine. Consumption, Markets and Culture. \n \n \nAbstract \nQuality claims based on provenance and authenticity are increasingly common in \ntoday\u2019s consumer marketplace, yet the strategic, material practices that inscribe products \nwith these values remain largely unexplored. Focusing on the specific example of wine, \nthe article conceptualizes wine promoters as cultural intermediaries engaged in the \nqualification of products. Drawing attention to cultural intermediaries\u2019 intertwined \nprofessional strategies and personal preferences, the discussion examines how notions \nof provenance (especially sincerity, heritage and transparency) serve as filters through \nwhich wine promoters choose goods to bring to market; and how these attributes are \nselectively and strategically highlighted through various techniques (including the use of \nthe winemaker as a promotional tool) to frame the wine as a premium product.  \n \nKeywords authenticity; cultural intermediaries; cultural economy; provenance; \nsincerity; transparency; wine \n \n \n \nIntroduction \nQuality claims based on \u2018where things come from\u2019 are found across a range of categories of \nconsumer products. As a marketing strategy, an emphasis on provenance and heritage has \nbeen found to be an effective positioning device for differentiating brands (Iversen and Hem \n2008; Keller 2003; Lim and O\u2019Cass 2001; Moor and Littler 2008; Piron 2000). Some \nprovenance claims are highly regulated\u2014as in the case of Country of Origin (COO), \nProtected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Appellation d\u2019origine controlee (AOC) \nproducts\u2014while others may be stylized (if not altogether fictional) marketing messages with \nvarying degrees of congruence with actual conditions of production. A recognition of the \nsocially constructed nature of provenance is echoed in recent discussions of the cultural \nmeaning and production of authenticity (Grazian 2003; Kirschenblatt-Gimblett 1998; \nPe\u00f1aloza 2000; Postrel 2003; Zukin 2009). Research in this vein has highlighted, on the one \nhand, the role of service workers and cultural producers in strategically embedding particular \n 2 \ngoods, services and practices within a framework of \u2018authenticity\u2019 in order to add economic \nvalue (Arnould and Price 1993; Beverland and Luxton 2005; Brown, Kozinets and Sherry \n2003; Fine 2003; Johnston and Baumann 2007; Lewis and Bridger 2001; Peterson 2005, \n1997); and, on the other, consumers\u2019 varied understandings of, desires for, and willingness to \npay a premium for, \u2018authentic\u2019 products and services (Arvidsson 2005; Beverland 2006; \nBeverland, Lindgreen and Vink 2008; Holt 1998; Leigh, Peters and Shelton 2006; \nMacCannell 1989; Sassatelli and Scott 2001; Thompson and Tambyah 1999). Despite such \nresearch making clear that authenticity and provenance claims are far from transparent and \nshould be treated as the outcomes of complex processes of cultural production and \nconsumption, there remains a lack of grounded, empirical research on how such claims are \nstrategically, materially produced by marketers and other cultural producers. \nThis article brings these concerns to bear on a consideration of wine. Wine is a \nprovenance product par excellence: a good for which origins and history are strategically \nframed to serve as key distinguishing features. Origin- and heritage-based quality claims are \ntypical in the wine market (e.g. Beverland and Luxton 2005; Thode and Maskulka 1998), in \nwhich a long-established notion of terroir asserts an intrinsic, crucial link between a wine and \nthe specific place and conditions of its production. However, this traditionalist view is \nchallenged both by socio-historical research on the cultural construction of terroir (e.g. Guy \n2001), and by the more fluid notions of provenance articulated in marketing messages, which \ndraw together notions of cultural and regional heritage, personality and authenticity (Charters \n2006; Vaudour 2002). The provenance of a wine (or any other good) is not indelibly stamped \non it at its source; nor is it simply an end-stage symbolic veneer applied by marketers. Rather, \nmeanings of \u2018where things come from\u2019 are worked and reworked by a variety of actors along \nthe commodity chain. The focus of the research discussed here is on the cultural producers \ninvolved in shaping wine as a provenance good.  \nWorking from a cultural economy perspective (Amin and Thrift 2004; du Gay and \nPryke 2002), the article explores how notions of provenance and authenticity inform the ways \nin which wine promoters identify products to bring to market and, in turn, frame them so as to \nadd value. In this regard, wine promoters may be understood as \u2018cultural intermediaries\u2019 \n(Bourdieu 1984) who operate at the intersections of production and consumption, and \neconomy and culture to accomplish the \u2018qualification of products\u2019 (Callon, M\u00e9adel and \nRabeharisoa 2002, 196). Cultural economic analyses of occupations in a wide array of fields \ndraw attention to the various skills, dispositions and forms of capital called upon by cultural \nintermediaries in the course of identifying and inscribing notions of quality. As market actors \nfor whom subjective preferences and experiences are crucial occupational resources, cultural \nintermediaries are simultaneously positioned as symbolic producers and taste-leading, high \ninvolvement consumers: reflexive producer\/consumers whose personal preferences and \nexperiences legitimate and inform professional practices (Smith Maguire 2010).  \nOf concern in this exploratory examination of the cultural production of wine as a \nprovenance good are the multiple ways in which wine promoters draw on notions of \nprovenance within their roles as reflexive producer\/consumers. The discussion of findings \nfocuses on two uses of provenance in particular. First, perceptions of and preferences for \nparticular attributes of provenance (especially sincerity, heritage, immediacy) serve as filters \nthrough which wine promoters identify\u2014from the thousands of available options\u2014those \nproducts that they will bring to market. Second, these attributes are selectively and \n 3 \nstrategically highlighted through various techniques (including the use of the winemaker as a \npromotional tool) to frame the wine as a premium product. Before considering the findings, \nthe paper proceeds with brief overviews of the theoretical framework and the research design. \n \nA cultural economy of provenance \nCultural economy may be understood as an \u2018analysis of the steps through which economic \nquantities and qualities are formed. \u2026[I]t is an attempt to identify the varied impulses and \narticulations through which value is formed, added, and circulated\u2019 (Amin and Thrift 2004, \nxiv-xv). One stream within this research on the formation of value foregrounds the cultural \nproducer. Here, cultural economy research builds on Bourdieu\u2019s initial formulation of cultural \nintermediaries as those implicated in the mediation of production and consumption and the \n\u2018orchestration\u2019 of product qualities and consumer tastes (1984, 230). Two key elements of the \ncultural economic framework merit highlighting with regard to their implications for a study \nof the construction of provenance within the wine market (or more broadly). \nFirst, by taking as a starting point the dialectical relationship between culture and \neconomy, cultural economic analyses are necessarily anti-epochal; they eschew the position \nthat there has been a radical break with the past and the emergence of a \u2018new\u2019 hybridization of \nculture and economy. As both du Gay (2004, 101) and McFall (2004, 79) point out, such \nradical breaks are empirically unsubstantiated and, indeed, refuted by anthropological and \nsociological research on the interconnections of economy and culture in practice. The task is \nto understand how the relationship between culture and economy is made and remade through \neveryday practices and institutions. This is not to deny that there have been changes in such \npractices and institutions, but to place those changes within a broader historical context, \nthereby tempering grand claims of epochal breaks.  \nIn this light, the development of provenance as a resonant and lucrative market offering \nmust be understood as the outcome of contingent and ongoing negotiations\u2014the outcome of \ncultural and economic calculations, strategies and forms of knowledge. This is true, too, of \nterroir, a notion of provenance that has been employed in \u2018Old World\u2019 wine regions such \nas\u2014and especially\u2014France. Despite traditionalists\u2019 claims for terroir as an objective, \nintrinsic bond between a product and its place of origin (Charters 2006), socio-historical \nresearch reveals how notions of terroir have been strategically constructed and articulated as \npart of \u2018ruralist and protectionist\u2019 discourses (Guy 2001, 164; see also Trubeck 2005), which \nresponded to economic imperatives (such as non-local competitors) and employed cultural \ncapital (such as local traditions and personalities, invented and otherwise; see Hobsbawm and \nRanger 1983). Provenance is an especially useful lens through which to examine how cultural \neconomic practices shape markets, as it casts a wider net than terroir with regard to what \n\u2018counts\u2019 from the culture of production in shaping a product\u2019s character and market value. \nTraditional elements of terroir (soil, climate, topography) are joined by such aspects as the \nbiography of the winemaker, or history of the vineyard, winery or region. Provenance has a \nconsiderably looser relationship than terroir with the actual conditions of production and, like \nauthenticity, should be regarded as a negotiated, not a primitive concept (Cohen 1988). \nSecond, cultural economic analyses tend not to focus on either production or \nconsumption, but rather examine the \u2018relational work\u2019 (Cochoy 2003 cited in du Gay 2004, \n100) that takes place between the two. Cultural intermediaries are of special interest in this \nregard and research has focused on the \u2018devices and dispositions\u2019 (du Gay 2004, 100) that \n 4 \nconstitute the promotion of consumption, including the various tools, criteria and practices, \nand rationalities, motivations and preferences that cultural intermediaries draw upon in order \nto contextualize products and mobilise consumer conduct (du Gay 2004; Miller and Rose \n1997). A growing body of case studies in fields such as advertising and branding (Cronin \n2004; McFall 2004; Moor 2008) and fashion design and retailing (Entwistle 2006; Pettinger \n2004; Skov 2002) explore ethnographically and historically how various occupations are \nimplicated in the mediation of production and consumption. \nM\u00e9adel and Rabeharisoa\u2019s research (1999 cited in Callon, M\u00e9adel and Rabeharisoa \n2002, 204-5) on the \u2018career\u2019 of orange juice, for example, highlights how a succession of \nactors\u2014tasters, buyers, sales managers, marketers and so forth\u2014transform the product, each \nworking with and adjusting the qualifications articulated by their predecessors in the \ncommodity chain. In this light, the cultural production of provenance may be understood as \nthe outcome of a variety of \u2018regimes of mediation\u2019 (Cronin 2004), involving a host of wine \nintermediaries who draw from their liminal position, within and between the realms of \nproduction and consumption. The provenance of a wine\u2014as received and articulated by\u2014any \nparticular wine promoter will depend on his or her location within the commodity chain: for \nexample, interceding between winemakers and retailers (e.g. wine importers, publicists); \nretailers and end consumers (e.g. sommeliers); or winemakers and end consumers (e.g. wine \nwriters). In other words, there are multiple layers and chains of mediation at work; \nrepresentations of provenance presented to the end consumer are the result of multiple, \nprogressive qualifications of provenance.  \nThis research is concerned, therefore, with how provenance features in the devices and \ndispositions of wine promoters as cultural intermediaries. The identification, contextualization \nand mobilization of provenance by wine promoters takes place at the intersection of, on the \none hand, subjective preferences and consuming experiences and, on the other, professional \nknowledge of the market and an occupational imperative to add value. \n \nStudying wine promoters  \nThe article is based on qualitative interviews with a sample of 45 individuals involved in \nshaping and promoting the premium wine market. The vast majority of respondents are \nspecifically involved in the Australian premium wine market: 25 of the respondents are based \nin Melbourne, 5 in Perth, 3 in Sydney. In terms of their primary roles, 14 are involved in the \nwine market as sommeliers and\/or retailers; 11 as publicists or marketers\/marketing \nconsultants; 8 as wine writers; 8 as winemakers or winemaking consultants; and the \nremainder as distributors\/importers. All of the respondents are involved\u2014to greater and lesser \ndegrees, with more and less intentionality\u2014in the promotion of wine, be it increasing the \nvisibility, legitimacy, market value or perceived quality of specific wines, wineries, or wine in \ngeneral. The respondents also all interact with small-scale wineries on a professional level, \nworking either directly or indirectly (but rarely exclusively) with boutique wineries or wines. \nThis is significant regarding the theme of provenance, as small-scale wine brands often have \nobjective production elements (e.g. a single vineyard or a family-owned and \u2013run operation) \nthat mark them as different from the large-scale brands against which they compete, and may \nbe more likely to yield resonant\u2014and lucrative\u2014quality claims.  \nThe research included two types of interviews, conducted in 2007 and 2008. Eight \ninterviews (R1-8) were conducted at a Melbourne trade event for New Zealand wineries; \n 5 \nthese \u2018flash\u2019 interviews (cf. Chapman 1999) lasted 5 to 15 minutes and involved an informal \ndiscussion about the particular wine brand. The remainder of the respondents, recruited from \npersonal contacts and snowball sampling, participated in hour-long semi-standardized \ninterviews, following an open question guide that explicitly probed the individual\u2019s work \npractices and consuming preferences. In this way, it was hoped that the explicit attention to \noperational practices would address the critique that discussions of cultural intermediaries \noften concentrate on lifestyle dispositions without due attention to the materiality of \nmediation (Entwistle 2006, 707).  \nThe analysis adopts an interpretive stance towards the data, and proceeds from the \nposition that the market exists only as a cultural practice (e.g. McFall 2004, 84). Thus, the \ninterviews are treated not as transparent reflections on practices and preferences, but as active \nmoments of self-production and cultural-production: a narrativizing of both the self (Giddens \n1991) and the category of provenance. A thematic analysis of the interview transcripts and \nfield notes was approached both deductively and inductively. A priori templates of codes \n(Crabtree and Miller 1999; King 2004) for analysing the data were derived from the literature \non cultural intermediaries, regarding the devices and dispositions called upon in their \nintertwined roles as symbolic producers who add value, and connoisseur consumers who \nassess value. The coding was an iterative process, guided by the templates but also \nresponding to data-driven inductive findings from within and between cases (Fereday and \nMuir-Cochrane 2006).  \nProvenance emerged in the analysis as a broad, meta-theme, incorporating assessments \nof and experiences with various elements of winemaking, both in general and with regard to \nspecific wines. From the deductive coding, following the promoters\u2019 dual roles as symbolic \nproducers and high-involvement consumers, provenance emerged both in terms of \nrespondents\u2019 professional strategies for distinguishing a wine within the marketplace (by, for \nexample, highlighting a winemaker\u2019s or wine region\u2019s history), and respondents\u2019 criteria for \nselecting wines for personal consumption (as in, for example, a preference for small-scale, \nsingle-vineyard wines). Inductive coding fleshed these themes out in greater detail, with \nrespect to the particular attributes or markers of provenance that were highlighted in the \nrespondents\u2019 accounts of their work practices and consuming preferences. \nMultiples forms and aspects of provenance are at play in the work of wine promoters. \nIn particular, from the analysis of interview transcripts and field notes, there emerged two key \nuses of provenance: a filtering device, and a framing device. These uses illuminate the \ninterconnectedness of devices and dispositions in the work of cultural intermediaries.  It is \nalong these two lines that the discussion of findings proceeds, below.  \n \nFiltering choices \nCultural intermediaries play a role in the formation of value through the ways in which they \nbring goods to market. For example, Entwistle (2006) examines how fashion buyers utilize \nassessments of relatively objective elements, such as a garment\u2019s shape, colour, texture and \nprice, alongside their subjective understanding of aesthetics, fashion and the tastes of their \ntarget customers, in order to determine what to select for their store. Similarly in the case of \nthe wine promoters: respondents assess objective elements (including the quality of the wine \nin the glass, particulars of the mode of production, specific price point and implications for \nidentifying direct competitors) in combination with subjective preferences and experiences to \n 6 \nidentify potential wines to promote, via their wine columns, distribution or retail portfolios, \nrestaurant wine lists, and so forth.  \nThe use of filtering devices is crucial, as the wine industry is crowded. For example, \nconsider the following newspaper wine writer\u2019s comments: \nI get 3 or 4 cases a week sent to me, unsolicited. That\u2019s typical for wine writers. And \nwhy do they do it? Because they know that there are two and a half thousand \nproducers out there and they know they have to get noticed. (R32; female)  \nSimilarly, a wine importer\/distributor (R23; male) explained why he tends to focus on \nboutique wineries in his portfolio: \nI think there\u2019s a raft of commercial wines that deliver something quite simple, and that \nis reasonable value for money at a certain price point. Beyond that, you\u2019re looking at \nlabels that are far smaller production\u2026 Their methods of production and their ethos \nare what sets them apart.  \nIf end consumers face staggering choice (Tesco, the largest UK distributor, for example, lists \n1,100 different wines), then the situation is even more pronounced for wine promoters. In \norder to narrow the field of choice, wine promoters bring subjective preferences\u2014in addition \nto objective criteria\u2014to bear on the thousands of available options, using their personal, \nconsuming experiences and dispositions to assess a wine\u2019s potential market viability. In this \nregard, provenance acts as a filtering device. Three elements of a wine\u2019s provenance were \nparticularly common in the respondents\u2019 narratives: sincerity, heritage, transparency.  \nThe first of these elements of provenance is the winemaker\u2019s perceived sincerity, which \nis often linked in the cultural imagination with economic disinterestedness (Beverland and \nLuxton 2005; Holt 1998; Johnston and Baumann 2007). A different newspaper wine writer \n(R41; female) complained of being overwhelmed by the overtures of wine publicists\u2014she is \nsent between 8 and 12 cases a week of wine. In looking for wines to write about in her \ncolumns, she tends to focus on the smaller producers rather than the large companies. As she \nexplains: \nI\u2019m not not going to follow up on something just because it\u2019s part of a large \ncompany\u2026but if I had a choice\u2026I would much prefer to support someone who\u2019s \nmaking a great product and who is also doing all the right things, working the land, \nwho\u2019s generous. For the big companies, it always comes down to the bottom line. And \nthat affects how they do things. They have these enormous marketing budgets. Some \nof them send you a press release every day, or they have a PR person bugging you \nevery day. They\u2019re selling you something all the time. But with the smaller producer, \nthey want you to judge them on their wine, and that\u2019s it. \nClaims to authenticity and sincerity are thus intertwined with a rejection of commercial \ninterests and economic instrumentalism. Perceived sincerity has two implications for adding \nvalue. On the one hand, it establishes a point of difference for the specific wine, which \nresonates with both the respondent\u2019s ethical preference to support smaller producers, and her \nstrategic assessment of what makes an interesting subject for her wine column. On the other, \nperceived sincerity adds value for the wine promoter, as it offers a device for resolving a \ndispositional conundrum that Bourdieu identifies for cultural intermediaries generally (1984, \n358-60, 365-66, passim). That is, charged with promoting or selling goods, which brings with \nit lower-class associations of the shopkeeper and economic instrumentalism, cultural \nintermediaries adopt a vocational mentality and identify instead with the more culturally \n 7 \nesteemed \u2018therapeutic\u2019 occupations, such as teaching and medicine (1984, 369). For them, \nselling is converted into preaching: cultural intermediaries don\u2019t sell so much as sell their own \nbeliefs, making them honest brokers and sincere mediators (Bourdieu 1984, 365; Smith \nMaguire 2008; Zukin 2004). Thus, what is at stake is not only the sincerity of the wine \nproducer, but also\u2014by virtue of choosing to write about such wines\u2014the wine writer.  \nThe second provenance element relates to the wine\u2019s heritage or tradition, which \nresonates with the increasingly common strategy of extracting market value from brand \nhistories (Pe\u00f1aloza 2000). Wine promoters utilize their specialized cultural knowledge (in \naddition to the strategically presented PR information created by other wine promoters) to \nevaluate the historical claims made by a wine\u2014be they about vineyard, winemaker, \nwinemaking techniques, region, or grape variety. For example, a wine writer (R30; female) \nfor an upscale financial magazine explained what she looks for in a wine as a potential \nsubject: \nA lot of it is about if you see the place and the people who made it. If you\u2019ve got a \nfamily business making fabulous wines for 15 generations, that is still on the same plot \nof land and you can talk to the people and you can taste the wine, then you can get a \nsense of that continuity of style that\u2019s developed over 300 years. That gives it a bit of \ncultural credit. The sense that people have a real connection to their product. I think in a \nlot of cases, you can taste that in the wine\u2014or you imagine you can taste it. And I have \na tendency to champion the small, passionate producers rather than the big, impressive \ncompanies. \nTelling, here, is the reference to personal experience: it is the wine promoters\u2019 past consuming \nexperiences that serve as the foundation on which their professional choices\u2014and \ncredibility\u2014rest. The  personal connectedness (if you see the place; if you know the \nwinemaker) facilitates an estimation of a particular product\u2019s marketability (which can then \nbe distilled and passed on, in a mediated fashion, to the end consumer). \nThe privileging of heritage is often accompanied by explicit juxtapositions of the small-\nscale and rural with the mass and industrial, linking back to the first element of sincerity. For \nexample, a sommelier\/restaurateur (R20; male) provided a rationale for his Old World-\nfocused wine list by referring to his own preference for Old World (typically Italian) wines \nover Australian producers:   \nI think the New World are like green winemakers, and the Old World are brown \nwinemakers. I\u2019m using that as a metaphor, green meaning clean, technical, stainless \nsteel, very structured; brown meaning chickens running around the vineyards, sort of \nrustic. What has happened with the green style winemaking, we\u2019ve become so green, \nthat our wines in Australia are suffering this homogenized effect. In my perspective \nand having an Italian background, it\u2019s simple: food, wine, and earnest conversation. \n\u2026 So, [the Old World] is incredibly romantic to me. \u2026 It\u2019s age-old, and it\u2019s been \nthere forever, so there\u2019s this beautiful romanticism.  \nA preference for the rural and the rustic is not confined to the field of wine nor the tastes of \nwine promoters. Indeed, MacCannell (1989) suggests that it is part of modern, Western \nconsciousness more generally, which quests for an authentic \u2018other\u2019 in an imagined past.  \nThe third provenance element relates to the transparency of a wine\u2019s culture of \nproduction. As has been shown elsewhere (e.g. Beverland 2006, Sassatelli and Scott 2001), \nmaking a production process seem knowable and tangible is a strategy for engendering \n 8 \nexperiences of authenticity and trust. Returning to the first wine writer (R32; female) cited \nabove, consider her experience in researching potential subjects for her weekly wine column: \nIt\u2019s not always the small guy, but the small guy tends to impact more on you because \nyou ring them up, you get on to the guy\u2014he probably answered the phone! (laughs)\u2014\nand he tells you, directly, how the wine is made. It\u2019s immediate. You get that insight \ninto their sense of ownership. With the big companies, you ring up the winemaker and \noften, they\u2019ll say, \u2018Have you OK\u2019d this with the media people?\u2019 So you have to go \nthrough the media people, and you might speak to the brand manager, before you finally \nget to speak to the winemaker. And over all that time, all that excitement that you had \nhas worn off!   \nThis account highlights the potential conflicts between different types of mediators and \nmodes of mediation in a commodity chain. This is especially pertinent for provenance \nproducts, as longer chains involve greater layers of mediation, which start to obscure the view \nof the origin. However, the immediacy of a wine\u2014or any other product\u2014should not be taken \nat face value. As Moor and Littler (2008, 705-6, passim) observe of American Apparel\u2019s \nbranding strategy, transparency as an aesthetic effect, produced by a range of strategic visual \nand material cues, is not necessarily matched by transparency regarding the actual conditions \nof production (e.g. information on company profits or employee salaries). A perception of \nimmediacy or transparency may thus be the effect of \u2018thick\u2019 mediation (as for American \nApparel) or \u2018thin\u2019 (as for R32).  \nWhen wine promoters use provenance as a filter to identify a wine to bring to market, \nthey are calling upon their own ethical mentalities, aesthetic sensibilities, forms of cultural \ncapital, and experience of and sensitivity to the tastes of others. These various forms of \nsubjective knowledge and dispositions are crucial in the successful mobilization of devices in \nthe further formation of value, when filtered choices are then framed for consumption by \nothers. \n \nFraming choices \nCultural intermediaries play a role in the formation of value by contributing to the \ncontextualizing of products. The use of framing devices is endemic to an \u2018economy of \nqualities,\u2019 what Callon, M\u00e9adel and Rabeharisoa (2002) term the contemporary service \neconomy. From this perspective, the qualities of goods are understood not as intrinsic, but as \nthe outcomes of an ongoing process of qualification and requalification, undertaken by a \nrange of actors including various market professionals and consumers. Classifying and \npositioning goods is central to the dynamic organization of, and competition within, today\u2019s \nconsumer markets; hence, the interest in the \u2018real professionals in product qualification and \nthe profiling of goods\u2019 (Callon, M\u00e9adel and Rabeharisoa 2002, 212).  \n For example, returning to Entwistle\u2019s research, fashion buyers make use of the \n\u2018pedagogic role of store placement\u2019 (2006, 715), adding value by placing new items in \nproximity to established prestige goods and thereby encouraging particular perceptions on the \npart of consumers. Similarly in the case of the wine promoters: once market-worthy wines \nhave been identified, they must then be framed for consumers as \u2018worthy choices\u2019 (Johnston \nand Baumann 2007, 170) through a variety of promotional strategies, such as designing logos, \npackaging and other promotional material, and securing endorsements and high-status \naffiliations for a wine. Here, the context of a wine\u2019s production may be used strategically to \n 9 \nmanage consumers\u2019 experiences and perceptions of the product. In this regard, provenance \nacts as a framing device. Within the respondents\u2019 various mobilizations of provenance as a \nframing device, the discussion below highlights the particular use of the winemaker as a \npromotional tool. \nDespite the fundamental role winemakers play in the wine market, their role in brand \nidentity has been largely the focus of journalistic rather than scholarly attention. An \nexception, Beverland and Luxton (2005, 111) note how winemakers travel and taste widely, \nin order to engage with buyers, consumers, winemakers and critics, thereby representing their \nbrand while getting a broad feel for consumer tastes and their competition. This fits within \nresearch (Beverland 2005, 2006; Beverland and Luxton 2005) on how luxury wine brands \nmay substantiate authenticity claims (based on affiliations with specific geographical places, \nhistorical traditions and long-standing stylistic consistency) by decoupling their brand image \nfrom the highly technical, industrial and, indeed, commercial realities of wine production, by \ndownplaying or disavowing their commercial strategies and promotional expertise. By being \n\u2018in the market\u2019 (Beverland and Luxton 2005, 111), the winemaker is simultaneously \nperforming his or her intrinsic passion for winemaking (thereby substantiating the brand\u2019s \nauthenticity) while engaging in an unacknowledged form of market research and promotion, \ndecoupling wine-as-craft from wine-as-commerce.  \nRecalling the discussion above, the wine promoters represented in this research are \nattentive to a winemaker\u2019s philosophy (e.g. small-scale or \u2018brown\u2019 (R20) producers), \naccessibility (e.g. answering one\u2019s own media calls) and biography (e.g. winemaking family \ntraditions) in their use of provenance as a filtering device. The winemaker was also a \nrecurring figure in the respondents\u2019 accounts of how they frame wines; that is, the winemaker \nwas identified by other wine promoters as a key promotional tool for the qualification of \nwines, as illustrated in the following three examples.   \nThe first example highlights the use of winemakers as a symbolic figure in other wine \npromoters\u2019 provenance stories. A sommelier\/restaurateur (R34; male) discusses how \ninteractions with winemakers provide fodder for narratives in his customer service role, \nhelping to contextualize the wine and \u2018bring it to life\u2019 for the end consumer:  \nPeople love a story. Quite often, someone will ask me about a wine and I\u2019ll start telling \nthem about the winemaker or the winery or whatever, and they\u2019ll buy the wine before I \neven get to talk about the wine. A lot of the time, people want their choice validated. \nThey want to know they\u2019re not making a mistake. They don\u2019t necessarily want  you to \nsay, you know: \u2018It\u2019s got strawberry fruit, great acid and nice length.\u2019 They want to \nknow: yes, it\u2019s a good choice; no, it\u2019s a bad choice. I always like to pick up on the little \nbits: I\u2019ll talk about if he\u2019s the winemaker of the year, or who does his labels\u2014that sort \nof thing. What we do is theatre. What they want to hear are those little, quirky stories.  \nIn short, personal knowledge of the winemaker makes it easier to tell a good story\u2014and thus \nto sell (and up-sell) the wine. As for cultural intermediaries more broadly, wine promoters are \ncharged with the \u2018production of the value of the [product] or, what amounts to the same thing, \nof the belief in the value of the [product]\u2019 (Bourdieu 1996, 229). For R34, facilitating a \nconsumer\u2019s belief in the value of a wine requires drawing upon the winemaker as an iconic \ncue to authenticity, whose presence in the story provides a symbolic, mediated link rather than \ndirect connection to the wine\u2019s provenance (cf. Beverland, Lindgreen and Vink 2008, 8). \n 10 \nThrough such provenance stories, a wine is singularized and personalized, framed as \nauthentic, and positioned as a premium product. \nIn the second example, the winemaker is a direct guarantor of sincerity and economic \ndisinterestedness. A wine importer\/distributor (R23; male) discusses the value of having the \nwinemakers he represents come in and talk to clients, such as restaurateurs: \nGenerally most of the producers are fairly competent marketers\u2026 You have to \nsometimes remind them to take their dirty jeans off and wear something appropriate \nwhen they\u2019re coming to see top clients, but in a lot of ways people don\u2019t mind \nnecessarily seeing that. As long as they\u2019re not uncouth, I think people don\u2019t mind \nseeing the raw, guts-and-all producer. Their hands are still filthy from the red \nferments, you know, they\u2019re bleary eyed, they\u2019ve been working fourteen-hour shifts \nfor ten weeks straight: people can understand and empathize, and you know, it sort of \nbrings it back home\u2026.it keeps it real. \nHere, the winemaker serves as an indexical cue to the wine\u2019s provenance, providing an actual \nlink to the creation of the wine for the audience (cf. Beverland, Lindgreen and Vink 2008, 8). \nAs such, the winemaker must not allow too great a gap\u2014in terms of appearance and \nbehaviour\u2014between his or her \u2018production\u2019 self (stained hands, bleary eyes) and \n\u2018promotional\u2019 self (sharing compelling anecdotes). \nThe third example, like the second, highlights how winemakers are used as a strategic \ndevice to circumvent the use of explicit promotional pitches. For example, a publicist (R17), \nwho makes use of winemakers in the wine events she organizes, says:   \nWhat I do is brief the winemakers and say, \u2018Look, don\u2019t tell us something that we \ncould learn from reading the bottle or going to the cellar door. Share with us some \nanecdotes like, you know maybe it was a disastrous vintage and you were really \nworried whether or not the grapes would come through or not, or maybe something \nhappened that you know, during vintage that was hilarious or maybe something bad \nhappened or something really good happened.\u2019 \u2026What I don\u2019t think people want to \nhear is a sales pitch. \u2026I think they just want to hear anecdotes and personal stories \nabout the winemaking process and about the winemaker and how the vineyard\u2019s \ngoing\u2026 \nThe personal narratives of winemakers are intended to frame wines as sincere by masking the \neconomic instrumentalism that has put the winemaker on show in the first place. In addition, \nreference to the vagaries of vintages reinforces the framing of wine as a natural, agricultural \nproduct, more \u2018real\u2019 than other, mass produced goods. Thus, the winemaker and the wine are \njuxtaposed with crass commercial technocrats and their bland, mass, homogenized products\u2014\nan implicit critique of the traditional mass market.   \nThe potency of provenance goods lies in their promise of a return to the more \nimmediate, spontaneous forms of human relations that, in nostalgic hindsight, appear to have \nbeen annihilated by the mass market. Like fair trade coffee, \u2018slow\u2019 food and cruelty-free \ncosmetics, provenance-oriented wines offer a \u2018gestural unmasking of the purported artifice of \ncommodified goods and services with the aim of recovering an intrinsic humanity or \nnaturalistic sociability they are believed to conceal\u2019 (Binkley 2008, 602). Provenance goods \nsuch as single-vineyard wine and artisanal cheese may offer a sense of connectedness, placing \nreflexive producer\/consumers in touch with a system of production in which the sources, \nmakers and context of the final goods are (felt to be) known and\/or knowable (Smith Maguire \n 11 \n2010). Wine\u2019s potency as a provenance good lies in its ability to facilitate a (mediated and \nstrategically managed) connection to the culture of production and thus to the social context \nof goods, and in this connectedness lies the potential for generating economic value (cf. \nArvidsson 2005). In this way, provenance serves as a tool for the re-enchantment of consumer \ngoods, not through spectacle or simulation (Ritzer 2005) but through personalization. \nEnchantment lies in the safely unpredictable biography and irrational passions of the \nwinemaker, while the benefits of the rationalization of consumer goods\u2014such as \npredictability and calculability\u2014are maintained: consumers are still assured that the wine will \nbe good and worth the price. \n The characteristics of a good (including its provenance) are not something to be \nrevealed, but to be made real through an ongoing process of qualification and requalification \n(Callon, M\u00e9adel and Rabeharisoa 2002). Thus, the framing work of wine promoters may be \nunderstood not as the representation of provenance, but as the (ongoing, contested) \nobjectification of provenance. Wine promoters make cultural and economic calculations in the \ntypes of stories they tell, offering a selective transparency (Lury 2004, 161) that is intended to \nconvince and reassure consumers that the wine is, indeed, a \u2018good choice.\u2019 In this, wine \npromoters use winemakers in different ways\u2014as a centrepiece for their narratives, a source of \npersonalized knowledge, a guarantee for the quality and authenticity of the wine, and a key \nagent in its promotion. The winemaker may be mobilized by wine promoters as a source of \nsincerity and a means of evading the impression of promotion per se. However, at the same \ntime as speaking to a distrust of economic instrumentalism, the respondents highlight the \nhighly managed nature of seemingly authentic, unmediated interactions: winemakers are \nprimed (by their promotional handlers and\/or by virtue of their own marketing wherewithal) \non the value of their \u2018realism\u2019 and what aspects of the winemaking process are most likely to \nyield marketable results. The winemaker\u2014and especially their personal biography\u2014may also \nbe mobilized as a way to add heritage or tradition and, more importantly, to personalize the \nproduct. Narratives about winemakers, wineries, vintages and varieties all help to \ncontextualize the product, mediating between the actual material production of a wine and its \nreception in the marketplace (cf. Jack and Phipps 2005, 55). In all of these regards, and \nothers, wine promoters extract value from their cultural capital\u2014knowledge of wine, \nexperiences touring vineyards, friendships with winemakers\u2014and particular taste for \nprovenance.  \n \nTaste and provenance \nRepresentations of provenance provide not a clear view of the origins of a product, but a \npartial window that reveals some aspects of the conditions of production (the charms of the \nvineyard, the quixotic dreams of the winemaker) while disguising or ignoring others (such as \nthe day-to-day financial and technical realities of making wine). Wines are thereby embedded \nin a particularized and personalized (and fictional) culture of production, intended to increase \nconsumers\u2019 trust in, and willingness to pay a premium for, the wine. However, constructions \nof provenance do not simply add value for the end consumer; provenance presents a number \nof value dimensions (Holbrook 1994) for wine promoters as well, including the extrinsic \nvalues of efficiency and quality (in assisting in the identification of \u2018good\u2019 wines); and \nintrinsic aesthetic and moral values (in the appreciation of, and satisfaction of championing, \nsmall-scale, artisan producers). To value provenance and align oneself with provenance goods \n 12 \nis to privilege the small-scale over the mass, the hard-to-find over the common\u2014and thus to \ninsist on the necessity of one\u2019s own distinctive access to, and knowledge of, such products. \nFor wine promoters, provenance is both a device for identifying marketable wines that \nsuit the intended market, and an expression of a disposition or personal preference for such \nelements as sincerity, heritage and transparency. Indeed, as for cultural intermediaries more \ngenerally, dispositions and devices (du Gay 2004) are inextricably intertwined because wine \npromoters sell their own tastes: it is their taste for provenance that underwrites the devices \nthey employ to frame provenance as added-value for others.  \nHowever, this creates a tension between the wine promoters\u2019 own tastes and those of \ntheir intended market. As the following two examples illustrate, wine promoters project their \ntastes onto the target consumer, not as a didactic (and impossible) imposition but as an \nempathetic diagnosis of others\u2019 needs and desires: \nThe hot thing right now is bespoke. Like, a hand-made shirt: that\u2019s what people want. It \nused to be, they wanted the brands\u2014Gucci shoes and Prada handbags. And now, no, \nthat\u2019s not cool anymore. What you need is what\u2019s been made for you especially. I \nsuppose that\u2019s what these [artisan] wines offer. They love the hand-crafted, hands-on \naspect of it\u2014that\u2019s the driving force. (R31; female; wholesale distributor of artisan wine \nbrands) \n \nIt\u2019s like anything: if you wear a dress, which was designed by someone that you met \nyou feel closer to it; if you buy a painting from an artist that you\u2019ve met, or you have \nyour house decorated by someone that you\u2019ve met\u2026 I think that people just like to have \nconnections with the people with whom they do transactions. \u2026People really want to \nfeel that they have a connection, so they have wine in the fridge that they can pull out \nand say to friends, \u2018Oh I met the winemaker and he was delightful,\u2019 or, you know, \u2018He \nwas an irascible character,\u2019 or whatever it may be. (R17; female; publicist who \norganizes wine events as part of her work for a luxury hotel) \nWine promoters are effective insofar as they can identify\u2014if not identify with\u2014the needs and \ndesires of the target market. While wine promoters must, as a matter of livelihood, insist on \nthe distinctiveness of their own tastes (and thus their unique ability to mediate between the \nrealms of production and consumption), they must also be credible \u2018proxy consumers\u2019 (Ennis \n2005 in Moor 2008, 422), demonstrating their knowledge of the tastes of their intended \nmarket.  \nWine promoters, like cultural intermediaries generally, are exemplars of, but not \nexceptions to, their cultural context. The provenance attributes the respondents value\u2014\nincluding sincerity, heritage and transparency\u2014are in keeping with research on authenticity \nmore generally, which has identified links to issues of economic disinterestedness and anti-\ncommercialism, nature and tradition, and the hand-crafted and local rather than the mass-\nproduced and industrialized (Beverland 2006; Beverland and Luxton 2005; Fine 2003; Holt \n1998; Johnston and Baumann 2007; MacCannell 1989; Sassatelli and Scott 2001; Zukin \n2009). Thus, it is not that wine promoters\u2019 perceptions of and preferences for provenance are \nnecessarily different from those of others. Rather, the distinctiveness of wine promoters lies in \ntheir ability to extract economic value from their tastes, converting such dispositions into \nvalue-adding devices.  \n \n 13 \nConclusion \nCultural intermediaries use their own tastes and experiences in making the cultural and \neconomic calculations involved in bringing goods to the marketplace. Wine promoters \nmediate between economy and culture when, for example, they: use cultural knowledge as a \ntool to achieve economic ends (e.g. wine publicists use winemakers\u2019 \u2018authentic\u2019 stories as \npromotional tools); economic logic is used to achieve cultural agendas (e.g. wine writers use \nthe circulation of their columns to draw attention to and protect small-scale producers); \neconomic ends are embedded in cultural activities (e.g. touristic visits to wineries provide \nsommeliers with ammunition to use in (up)selling to the end consumer); and cultural \nknowledge is embedded in economic calculations (e.g. wine distributors use their \ninterpersonal knowledge of winemakers to identify the most promising wines to add to their \nportfolio). In their personal preferences and professional practices, the respondents identify, \ninscribe and objectify the sincerity, heritage and immediacy of a wine\u2019s culture of production.  \nThe provenance of a product, as represented to the end consumer, is a combination of \nmaterial and narrative elements. In an ideal sense, provenance refers to the actual source and \nhistory of a good\u2014an account of its \u2018start\u2019 at the furthest point upstream in a commodity \nchain, and its development through various stages of production and distribution until it \nreaches the final consumer. As a marketing construct, however, provenance may be highly \nfictionalized\u2014a stylized, symbolic \u2018package\u2019 added near the end of the commodity chain. \nFrom a cultural economy point of view, which recognizes that goods undergo complex and \nongoing material and symbolic transformation, provenance is objectified\u2014made real\u2014\nthrough a process of qualification and requalification (Callon, M\u00e9adel and Rabeharisoa 2002) \nthat occurs across multiple \u2018regimes of mediation\u2019 (Cronin 2004). As such, attributes and \ninscriptions of provenance may overlap or be overwritten as the wine \u2018moves\u2019 between \nintermediaries (cf. M\u00e9adel and Rabeharisoa 1999 cited in Callon, M\u00e9adel and Rabeharisoa \n2002). For example, the winemakers\u2019 experiences of the provenance of a wine (through \nhands-on participation in its creation) may be transmitted through a narrative (itself partial \nand strategic) for the distributor, who will then select attributes to highlight in training \nrestaurant staff on a wine\u2019s provenance story. Similarly, wine promoters\u2019 personal \nexperiences and evaluations of a wine\u2019s origins and history are used to identify marketable \ngoods, without any necessary requirement for those notions of provenance to then carry \ndownstream to the end consumer. Further research is needed on the progressive qualifications \nof wines, tracing the ways in which notions of provenance are written, rewritten and \noverwritten by successive cultural intermediaries as a wine moves from production to \nconsumption and mapping the relationships between commodity chains of various lengths and \ndifferent regimes of mediation. How and to what effect do long and short chains entail thick \nand thin regimes of mediation?  \nIn closing, looking beyond the specific case of wine, the focus on provenance as a \nsource of economic value is increasingly pertinent in the current economic climate and \nconsumer market. Heightened competition has intensified the need for brands to craft a \ndistinctive identity; quality claims based on heritage, origin and authenticity are increasingly \nto be found in retail sectors including fashion, cuisine, and hospitality. The value of \nprovenance is linked to the perceived shortcomings of contemporary cultures of production\u2014\nincluding increasingly long and inscrutable commodity chains and mass, impersonal relations \nof exchange; failures in trust and security; and emotionally deadening rationalization and \n 14 \npredictability (e.g. Binkley 2008; Lury 2004; Ritzer 2005; Sassatelli and Scott 2001). \nProvenance goods are a selective response to such conditions\u2014an emphasis on the personal \nand knowable origins of products, but (typically) with assurances of predictability and \ncalculability. The wine promoter is but one example of cultural intermediaries who, more \ngenerally, employ cultural capital and economic logics to \u2018re-enchant\u2019 particular goods as \nauthentic, and thereby render them worthy of a premium. \n \nReferences  \nAmin, A. and N.
