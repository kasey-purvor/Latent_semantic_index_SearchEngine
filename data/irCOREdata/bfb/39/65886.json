We calculate three-point functions of these operators\nto the first order in the effective Yang-Mills coupling \u03bb\u2032 = g2YMN\/J\n2 in planar perturba-\ntion theory. On the string theory side, we derive the explicit expressions of the Neumann\nmatrices to all orders in 1\/(\u00b5p+\u03b1\u2032)2. This allows us to compute the corresponding three-\nstring scattering amplitudes. This provides an all orders prediction for the field theory\nthree-point functions. We compare our field theory results with the string theory results\nto the subleading order in 1\/(\u00b5p+\u03b1\u2032)2 and find perfect agreement.\n1 Introduction\nBerenstein, Maldacena and Nastase (BMN) put forward an insightful proposal towards\nunderstanding of the massive string modes [1]. The field theory side of this correspondence\nis the conformal N = 4 SYM in a new double scaling limit. The nature of this double\nscaling limit was further elucidated in [2\u20134].\nCrucial to the BMN line of reasoning is the emergence of the pp-wave background,\nwhich arises as a Penrose limit [6] of AdS5\u00d7S5 [7\u20139]. This background is maximally super-\nsymmetric and remarkably string theory in this background is exactly solvable, see [10,11]\nfor closed strings, and [12\u201314] for the open string case. First attempts towards under-\nstanding of the holographic relation in the pp-wave context were made in [15\u201318]. The\npp-wave\/SYM correspondence of BMN goes significantly beyond the original AdS\/CFT\nduality [19\u201323] since it provides a map between field theory operators and generic string\nstates in the lightcone gauge, and not just the supergravity multiplet (n = 0). For exam-\nple,\n1\u221a\nJNJ\/2+1\nTrZJ \u2190\u2192 |0, p+\u3009, (1)\n1\u221a\nJNJ\/2+1\nJ\u2211\nl=0\nTr[\u03c63Z l\u03c64ZJ\u2212l]e\n2piinl\nJ \u2190\u2192 a7\u2020n a8\n\u2020\n\u2212n|0, p+\u3009. (2)\nThese relations give the string vacuum and the first excited string states in terms of SYM\noperators. Here N is the number of colours and Z = \u03c65 + i\u03c66 is a complex scalar field\nwith unit R charge. The scaling dimensions \u2206 of the Yang-Mills operators in (1), (2) are\nrelated to the masses of the corresponding string states via\n\u2206\u2212 J = Hlc\/\u00b5, (3)\nwhere Hlc is the lightcone string Hamiltonian and \u00b5 is the scale of the pp-wave metric.\nWritten in terms of gauge theory parameters, this gives a prediction for the conformal\ndimension of the BMN operators\n\u2206\u2212 J =\n\u221a\n1 +\ng2YMNn\n2\nJ\n. (4)\nThe BMN correspondence is understood to hold in the double scaling limit:\nN \u2192\u221e , J \u223c\n\u221a\nN with gYM fixed. (5)\nIn this limit the \u2019t Hooft coupling \u03bb = g2YMN is infinite and perturbative calculations in\ngauge theory are hopeless in general. A well known exception to this rule concerns BPS\n1\noperators which receive no perturbative corrections at all, and their scaling dimensions\n\u2206 coincide with their free theory engineering dimensions \u22060. BMN instead considered a\nclass of \u2018near-BPS\u2019 operators, as in (2) with large R-charge J , which do receive quantum\ncorrections, but these operators are constructed in such a way that in perturbative eval-\nuation of their scaling dimensions, \u03bb is accompanied by a suppression factor 1\/J2. For\nthese operators the coupling is effectively\n\u03bb\u2032 =\ng2YMN\nJ2\n=\n1\n(\u00b5p+\u03b1\u2032)2\n, (6)\nwhich is finite in the large N limit (5) and can be taken small [1], see also [2\u20134].\nIt was further assumed in [1] that the gauge theory remains planar in the limit (5)\nfor the class of BMN operators even though the original \u2019t Hooft coupling \u03bb is infinite.\nNon-planar diagrams in the BMN limit (5) were first studied in [2] and in [3] and were\nfound to be important and governed by J4\/N2. It follows from the double scaling limit\n(5) that in addition to \u03bb\u2032 defined in (6), there is a second dimensionless constant\ng2 :=\nJ2\nN\n= 4\u03c0gs(\u00b5p\n+\u03b1\u2032)2 , (7)\nwhich plays the ro\u02c6le of the genus counting parameter as explained in [2, 3].\nIn this paper, we will be mostly concerned with the following BMN operators:\nOJvac :=\n1\u221a\nJNJ\ntr(ZJ), (8)\nOJ0 :=\n1\u221a\nNJ+1\ntr(\u03a6ZJ), (9)\nOJn,\u2212n :=\n1\u221a\nJNJ+2\nJ\u2211\nl=0\ntr(\u03a6Z l\u03a8ZJ\u2212l)e\n2piinl\nJ (10)\nand their two and three-point correlation functions. Here\n\u03a6 = \u03c61 + i\u03c62, \u03a8 = \u03c63 + i\u03c64, Z = \u03c65 + i\u03c66 (11)\nare the three complex scalar fields of theN = 4 theory. In perturbation theory, the flavour\nof \u03a6, \u03a8 and Z is conserved. The operators OJvac,OJ0 ,OJ0,0 are half BPS and correspond to\nthe string vacuum and supergravity states. The operator OJn,\u2212n for n 6= 0 is non-BPS and\nreceives quantum corrections to its scaling dimension. At the level of planar diagrams,\nBMN operators do not mix [2\u20134] and have well-defined conformal dimensions. Two and\nthree-point functions of chiral operators with arbitrary R-charges had been calculated\n2\nin [5] and [2]. It follows from the conformal invariance of the theory that the two-point\nfunction can be written in the canonical form 1\n\u3008Oi(0)Oj(x)\u3009 = \u03b4ij\n(4\u03c02x2)\u2206i\n. (12)\nFurthermore conformal invariance implies that the three-point function takes the form\n\u3008Oi1(x1)Oi2(x2)Oi3(x3)\u3009 =\nCi1i2i3\n(4\u03c02x212)\n\u22061+\u22062\u2212\u22063\n2 (4\u03c02x213)\n\u22061+\u22063\u2212\u22062\n2 (4\u03c02x223)\n\u22062+\u22063\u2212\u22061\n2\n(13)\nwhere x2ij := (xi\u2212xj)2. When nonplanar diagrams are taken into account, BMN operators\nOJn,\u2212n with different nonvanishing values of n mix with each other already in free field\ntheory [2, 3]. Hence the original BMN operators do not have well defined conformal\ndimensions and one has to define a new basis of such operators which does not mix [2].\nThis redefinition has to be implemented order by order in g2 and \u03bb\n\u2032. Equations (12)\nand (13) represent the correlation functions of these redefined operators with well-defined\nconformal dimensions \u2206i. The authors of [4] calculated anomalous dimensions to the\norder \u03bb\u20322 at the planar level (leading order in g2). Alternatively, one may also go beyond\nthe original BMN perturbative computation of anomalous dimensions by including higher\ngenus diagrams [2, 3]. Planar three-point functions involving nonchiral operators in free\nfield theory were calculated in [3]. In this paper, we will consider the planar limit in order\nto work with the original BMN basis of operators, thus avoiding the complications from\noperator mixing.\nDue to conformal invariance, all the nontrivial information of the three-point function\nis contained in the x-independent coefficient Ci1i2i3 . It is natural to expect that Ci1i2i3 is\nrelated to 3-strings interaction in pp-wave background. One such proposal was put forward\nin [3] and further analyzed in [24]. The proposal of [3] states that the matrix element of\nthe lightcone Hamiltonian is related to the coefficient of the three-point function in field\ntheory via\n\u3008i|P\u2212|j, k\u3009 = \u00b5(\u2206i \u2212\u2206j \u2212\u2206k)Cijk (14)\nin the leading order in \u03bb\u2032. Another proposal considered in [25] relates the ratio of the\nthree-string amplitudes with those of the field theory three-point function coefficients\n\u3008\u03a61|\u3008\u03a62|\u3008\u03a63|V \u3009\n\u300801|\u300802|\u300803|V \u3009 =\nC123\nC\n(vac)\n123\n. (15)\nHere \u3008\u03a61|\u3008\u03a62|\u3008\u03a63|V \u3009 is the three-string scattering amplitude in the string field theory\nformalism, \u300801|\u300802|\u300803|V \u3009 is the vacuum amplitude and V is the lightcone three-string\nvertex [27]. C123 (resp. C\n(vac)\n123 ) is the three-point function coefficient of the corresponding\nBMN operators (resp. of the \u201cvacuum\u201d operators (8)).\n1The operators in (8), (9), (10) are already normalized such that (12) holds in free field theory.\n3\nAll the tests in [3, 24, 25] were restricted to the free field value of C123. In section 3,\nwe will calculate the three-point functions in gauge theory to the first nontrivial order in\n\u03bb\u2032. According to (6), our results correspond to string theory in the subleading order in\n\u03bb\u2032 = 1\/(\u00b5p+\u03b1\u2032)2. In section 4, we will derive the corresponding three-string amplitudes\nand find perfect agreement with the field theory results to O(\u03bb\u2032). The string computation\ncan be easily generalized to all orders in \u03bb\u2032 and we obtain the exact form of the Neumann\nmatrices explicitly. Our string theory results give an exact prediction for the field theory\nthree-point functions.\n2 Two-point function:\nnormalization of BMN operators at order \u03bb\u2032\nAt the first order in \u03bb\u2032, the normalization of OJn,\u2212n in (10) has to be modified. To\ndetermine this normalization, we have to know precisely the two-point function to order\n\u03bb\u2032. The correlation functions of composite operators require UV regularization. We will\nuse dimensional reduction to D = 4 \u2212 2\u01eb dimensions and work with Feynman rules in\ncoordinate space. Since we work with planar diagrams, the group indices are trivial and\nthe scalar propagator is given by\n\u2206(x) =\n\u0393(1\u2212 \u01eb)\n4\u03c02\u2212\u01eb(x2)1\u2212\u01eb\n. (16)\nThe scalar four-point interaction can be conveniently divided into F-terms and D-terms:\nLF = \u22122g2YMtr\n(\n[Z,\u03a6][\u03a6\u00af, Z\u00af] + [Z,\u03a8][\u03a8\u00af, Z\u00af] + [\u03a6,\u03a8][\u03a8\u00af, \u03a6\u00af]\n)\n, (17)\nLD = \u2212g2YMtr\n(\n[Z, Z\u00af]2 + 2[\u03a6, \u03a6\u00af][Z, Z\u00af] + 2[\u03a8, \u03a8\u00af][Z, Z\u00af] + 2[\u03a6, \u03a6\u00af][\u03a8, \u03a8\u00af]\n)\n. (18)\nAt the planar level and to the first order in \u03bb\u2032, by inspecting individual diagrams it is easy\nto see that only the F-term interactions (17) will contribute to the two and three-point\nfunctions; the D-term interactions, as well as the scalar self energy corrections and gluon\nexchanges between two scalars will have a vanishing net contribution. The cancellation\nin fact takes place to all orders in the genus expansion as was explained in [3, 26].\nTaking into account one insertion of the vertices from LF , and combining with the\nfree result, one obtains the two-point function in the large J limit\nG2(x) := \u3008O\u00afJn,\u2212n(0)OJn,\u2212n(x)\u3009 = \u2206(x)J+2(1\u2212 8\u03c02\u03b4 \u00b7 I(x)) (19)\nwhere\n\u03b4 = n2\u03bb\u2032 (20)\n4\nis the anomalous dimension of the operator OJn,\u2212n, and I(x) is the interaction integral\nwith \u2206(x)2 removed:\nI(x) :=\n(\n\u0393(1\u2212 \u01eb)\n4\u03c02\u2212\u01eb\n)2\n(x2)2\u22122\u01eb\n\u222b\nd4\u22122\u01eby\n(y2)2\u22122\u01eb(y \u2212 x)2(2\u22122\u01eb)\n=\n1\n8\u03c02\n(\n1\n\u01eb\n+ \u03b3 + 1 + log \u03c0 + log x2 +O(\u01eb)). (21)\nWe use a subtraction scheme which subtract the 1\/\u01eb pole together with a finite part s\n1\n\u01eb\n+ s. (22)\nTo comply with the canonical form (12), the properly normalized OJn,\u2212n is given by\nOJn,\u2212n =\n1 + \u03b4\n2\n(\u03b3 + 1\u2212 log 4\u03c0 \u2212 s)\u221a\nJNJ+2\nJ\u2211\nl=0\ntr(\u03a6Z l\u03a8ZJ\u2212l)e\n2piinl\nJ . (23)\nThe log x term on the right hand side of (21) was originally calculated in [1] and this\nwas sufficient to extract the anomalous dimension. Here we have determined the scheme\ndependent finite part. For physical quantities, the scheme dependence must disappear.\nAfter we normalize the operators according to (12), all the correlation functions must be\nscheme independent. In the next section, we will calculate Ci1i2i3.\n3 Three-point function\nIn this section, we will calculate two simple examples of three-point functions\nG3(x1, x2) := \u3008O\u00afJn,\u2212n(0)OJ10,0(x1)OJ2vac(x2)\u3009, (24)\nG\u02dc3(x1, x2) := \u3008O\u00afJn,\u2212n(0)OJ10 (x1)OJ20 (x2)\u3009, (25)\nto the first order in \u03bb\u2032 and at the planar level. Here J = J1 + J2.\nWe first consider G3. The free field theory diagrams are shown in figure 1 and the\nsurviving interacting diagrams which arise from the F-term interactions are shown in\nfigure 2. Our result is given by\nG3 =\nJ2\nN\n\u221a\nJJ1J2\n[1 +\n\u03b4\n2\n(\u03b3 + 1\u2212 log 4\u03c0 \u2212 s)] \u00b7\u2206(x1)J1+2\u2206(x2)J2(P1 + \u03bbK(x1, x2)P2).\n(26)\nThe factor [1 + \u03b4\n2\n(\u03b3 + 1 \u2212 log 4\u03c0 \u2212 s)]\/(NJ+2\u221aJJ1J2) arises from the normalizations of\nthe operators; in addition summing over the loops of the planar diagram gives rise to a\n5\n\u03a6\u00af\n\u03a8\u00af\nk\nl\nx1\nx2\nFigure 1: Free diagrams for G3 contributing to P1.

Another factor of J2 arises from inequivalent Wick contractions of Ovac\nwith the rest.\nEach of the diagrams carries a phase factor which arises from the operator On,\u2212n and\ndepends on the relative position of \u03a6 and \u03a8. To obtain the total contribution, one has to\nsum over all possible positions of \u03a6 and \u03a8 which amounts to inequivalent \u201celectrostatic\u201d\ndiagrams in figures 1, 2, 3 and 4. In (26), P1 and P2 represent the total contributions of\nthese phase factors for the free and interacting diagrams of figures 1 and 2 respectively.\nThe contributions of diagrams in figures 3 and 4 will be shown to sum to zero. For P1,\nwe have\nP1 =\n\u2211\n0\u2264k,l\u2264J1\ne\n2piin\nJ\n(l\u2212k) (27)\nand in the large J limit\nP1 =\nJ2\nn2\u03c02\nsin2(\nn\u03c0J1\nJ\n). (28)\n6\nThe phase factor P2 arises from the diagrams with one interaction vertex inserted (figure\n2). We only need to take into account interaction vertices arising from the F-terms since as\nmentioned earlier, D-term scalar interactions, self energy corrections and gluon exchanges\nsum to zero. We find\nP2 = 2(e\n\u2212 2piin\nJ \u2212 1)\nJ1\u2211\nl=0\ne\u2212\n2piinl\nJ + 2(e\n2piin\nJ \u2212 1)\nJ1\u2211\nl=0\ne\n2piinl\nJ (29)\n=\nJ2\nn2\u03c02\nsin2(\nn\u03c0J1\nJ\n) \u00b7 \u22128\u03c0\n2n2\nJ2\n. (30)\nThe first term on the right hand side of (29) comes from the diagrams 2a and 2b. The\nrelative sign is easily seen from the commutators in LF . The second term in (29) comes\nfrom the diagrams 2c and 2d, where the \u03a6 interaction is now at the bottom. The multi-\nplicative factors of 2 in (29) arise from summing the diagrams in figure 2 with \u03a6 and \u03a8\nexchanged.\nThe remaining F-terms diagram are shown in figures 3 and 4 and it is easy to see that\nthere is a precise cancellation diagram by diagram between figure 3 and figure 4. For\nexample, diagram 3a cancels diagram 4a as they have the same phase factor but opposite\nsign. Hence these classes of diagrams do not contribute to G3.\n\u03a6\u00af\n\u03a6\u00af\n\u03a6\u00af\n\u03a6\u00af\n\u03a6\u00af\u03a6\u00af \u03a8\u00af\n\u03a8\u00af\u03a8\u00af\n\u03a8\u00af\n\u03a8\u00af\u03a8\u00af\nkkkk\nll\nll\nll\nx1x1\nx1x1x1x1\nx2 x2\nx2x2x2x2\n3a 3b 3c 3d\n3e 3f\nFigure 3: Interacting diagrams for G3.

(35)\nThe only nontrivial difference from the previous case is encoded in the factors P5 and P6.\nThe factor P5 is the sum of phase factors from the free diagrams (see figure 5):\nP5 =\nJ1\u2211\nk=0\nJ2\u2211\nl=0\ne\n2pii(k+l)n\nJ = \u2212 J\n2\nn2\u03c02\nsin2(\nn\u03c0J1\nJ\n).

(37)\n9\nWe remark that the classes of diagrams similar to figure 3 and figure 4 cancel each other\nidentically for the same reason as before.\nFinally we obtain\nG\u02dc3(x1, x2) =\nC\u02dc123\n(4\u03c02x21)\nJ1+1+\n\u03b4\n2 (4\u03c02x22)\nJ2+1+\n\u03b4\n2 (4\u03c02x212)\n\u2212 \u03b4\n2\n, (38)\nwhere the three-point function coefficient is\nC\u02dc123 = \u2212J\n3\/2\nN\n1\nn2\u03c02\nsin2(\nn\u03c0J1\nJ\n) (1\u2212 \u03bb\n\u2032n2\n2\n). (39)\n4 Comparison with string theory\nLast week, using the formalism of [27, 28], Huang [25] calculated the ratio on the LHS of\n(15) in the large \u00b5p+\u03b1\u2032 limit and found agreement with the free field theory expression.\nIn this section, we will generalize his computation of the string amplitudes to all orders\nin 1\/(\u00b5p+\u03b1\u2032)2 and compare these new results with the field theory expressions derived in\nthe last section. We find perfect agreement to O(\u03bb\u2032).\nIn the pp-wave background, the cubic string vertex is given by |V \u3009 = EaEb|0\u3009, where\nEa and Eb are the bosonic and fermionic operators. For our purposes, we need only the\nexpression for Ea [27],\nEa \u223c exp\n[\n1\n2\n3\u2211\nr,s=1\n\u221e\u2211\nm,n=\u2212\u221e\na\n\u2020\nm(r)N\n(rs)\nmn a\n\u2020\nn(s)\n]\n, (40)\nwhere\nN\n(rs)\nmn = \u03b4\nrs\u03b4mn \u2212 2\u221a\u03c9m(r)\u03c9n(s)(X(r)T\u0393\u22121a X(s))mn (41)\nare the Neumann matrices;\n\u03c9n(r) =\n\u221a\nn2 + (\u00b5\u03b1(r))2, \u03b1(r) := \u03b1\n\u2032p+(r) (42)\nare the oscillation frequencies of the r-th string, and the matrix \u0393a is given by\n(\u0393a)mn =\n3\u2211\nr=1\n\u221e\u2211\np=\u2212\u221e\n\u03c9p(r)X\n(r)\nmpX\n(r)\nnp . (43)\nThe matrices X(r) arise from the overlapping integrals in string field theory, they were\ncomputed in [27] and are independent of \u00b5. Thus the whole \u00b5 dependence is concentrated\nin the frequencies \u03c9m(r).\n10\nTo the first order in 1\/(\u00b5\u03b1\u2032p+)2 = \u03bb\u2032, we have\n\u03c9n(3) = \u00b5\u03b1\n\u2032p+(1 +\n\u03bb\u2032n2\n2\n), (44)\n\u03c9n(1) = \u03ba\u00b5\u03b1\n\u2032p+(1 +\n\u03bb\u2032n2\n2\u03ba2\n), (45)\n\u03c9n(2) = (1\u2212 \u03ba)\u00b5\u03b1\u2032p+(1 + \u03bb\n\u2032n2\n2(1\u2212 \u03ba)2 ), (46)\nwhere p+ = p+(3). Here \u03ba is the ratio of the lightcone momentum of string 1 and 3,\n\u03ba \u2261 \u03ba1 :=\np+(1)\np+\n=\nJ1\nJ\n, \u03ba2 :=\nJ2\nJ\n= 1\u2212 \u03ba (47)\nOur next goal is to compute the matrix \u0393a. The leading order expression in the large\n\u00b5\u03b1\u2032p+ limit was computed in [25] and reads\n(\u0393(0)a )mn = 2\u00b5\u03b1\n\u2032p+\u03b4mn. (48)\nAt the next order in \u03bb\u2032, we find\n(\u0393a)mn = (\u0393\n(0)\na )mn +\n\u03bb\u2032\n2\n\u2211\nl\n[\nl2\n\u03ba21\n\u03c9\n(0)\nl(1)X\n(1)\nmlX\n(1)\nnl + (1\u2194 2)\n]\n+\n\u03bb\u2032n2\n4\n(\u0393(0)a )mn, (49)\nwhere \u03c9\n(0)\nl(r) = \u03bar\u00b5\u03b1\n\u2032p+ are the frequencies in the lowest order in \u03bb\u2032. Using the explicit\nexpressions for X\n(r)\nml and summation formulae from the appendix D of [28], we obtain\n(\u0393a)mn = (\u0393\n(0)\na )mn + \u00b5\u03b1\n\u2032p+\u03bb\u2032n2\u03b4mn = (\u0393\n(0)\na )mn\n(\n1 +\n\u03bb\u2032n2\n2\n)\n. (50)\nUsing this result, we derive the expression for the following elements of the Neumann\nmatrices,\nN\n(3r)\nn0 = [N\n(3r)\nn0 ]\n(0)\n(\n1\u2212 \u03bb\n\u2032n2\n4\n)\n, r = 1, 2, (51)\nwhich will be needed for the analysis below. The novelty in our results (50) and (51)\nlies in the second terms on the RHS, which are the O(\u03bb\u2032) corrections to the zeroth order\nresults of [25] and\n[N\n(3r)\nmn ]\n(0) = \u2212\u221a\u03bar(X(3)TX(r))mn. (52)\n11\nNow we consider the string scattering amplitudes which correspond to the field theory\nthree-point functions G3 and G\u02dc3. We have on the field theory side\nC123\nC\n(vac)\n123\n=\nJ\nJ1\n1\nn2\u03c02\nsin2(\nn\u03c0J1\nJ\n) \u00b7 (1\u2212 \u03bb\n\u2032n2\n2\n), (53)\nC\u02dc123\nC\n(vac)\n123\n= \u2212 J\u221a\nJ1J2\n1\nn2\u03c02\nsin2(\nn\u03c0J1\nJ\n) \u00b7 (1\u2212 \u03bb\n\u2032n2\n2\n), (54)\nwhere C\n(vac)\n123 =\n\u221a\nJJ1J2\/N .\nOn the string side, we have for the first process (corresponding to (53)),\n\u3008\u03a61|\u3008\u03a62|\u3008\u03a63|V \u3009\n\u300801|\u300802|\u300803|V \u3009 =\n1\n4\n(N\n(31)\nn0 \u2212N (31)\u2212n0)2 (55)\n=\n1\n4\n([N\n(31)\nn0 \u2212N (31)\u2212n0](0))2 \u00b7 (1\u2212\n\u03bb\u2032n2\n2\n)\n=\nJ\nJ1\n1\nn2\u03c02\nsin2(\nn\u03c0J1\nJ\n) \u00b7 (1\u2212 \u03bb\n\u2032n2\n2\n) (56)\nwhich is in perfect agreement with (53). Similarly for the second string scattering (corre-\nsponding to (54)), we obtain (cf. [25])\n\u3008\u03a61|\u3008\u03a62|\u3008\u03a63|V \u3009\n\u300801|\u300802|\u300803|V \u3009 =\n1\n2\nN\n(31)\nn0 N\n(32)\nn0 (57)\n=\n1\n2\n[N\n(31)\nn0 N\n(32)\nn0 ]\n(0) \u00b7 (1\u2212 \u03bb\n\u2032n2\n2\n)\n= \u2212 J\u221a\nJ1J2\nsin2(\nn\u03c0J1\nJ\n) \u00b7 (1\u2212 \u03bb\n\u2032n2\n2\n) (58)\nwhich is again in agreement with our field theory result.\nFinally we generalize our string computations to all orders in \u03bb\u2032. To do this, we note\nthat using the formulae in the appendix, it is easy to derive\n(\u0393a)mn = 2\u00b5\u03b1\n\u2032p+\n\u221a\n1 + \u03bb\u2032n2\u03b4mn = 2\u03c9n(3)\u03b4mn. (59)\nThis was obtained by substituting the all-orders expansion of the square root in \u03c9n(r) =\u221a\nn2 + (\u00b5\u03b1(r))2 in the large \u00b5 limit into (43). The resulting expression involves an infinite\nsum arising from the multiplication of matrices of infinite dimension. In order to work\nwith well-defined expressions, the sum has to be regularized. As standard in string theory,\nwe use the zeta function regularization, as outlined in the Appendix. It then follows from\n(41) that\nN\n(3r)\nnm = [N\n(3r)\nnm ]\n(0)\n(\n1 + \u03bb\u2032m2\/\u03ba2r\n1 + \u03bb\u2032n2\n)1\/4\n, r = 1, 2. (60)\n12\nThe results (59), (60) generalize (50), (51) to all orders in \u03bb\u2032. Equation (59) was derived\nby resumming all-orders expansions in the large \u00b5 (small \u03bb\u2032) limit. These expansions\ncontained only integer powers of \u03bb\u2032. Our analysis is complete (in the sense that it does\nnot miss any terms) in the vicinity of \u03bb\u2032 = 0 and it cannot be analytically extrapolated to\nthe opposite regime of \u03bb\u2032 = \u221e. Even though our result (59) has a closed analytic form,\nit is interpreted as an asymptotic expansion2 in powers of \u03bb\u2032. This allows us to compute\nthe corresponding three-string amplitudes to all orders in small \u03bb\u2032. Note that the direct\nuse of (59) to the opposite regime of large \u03bb\u2032 is not allowed, and in fact the Neumann\nmatrices for \u03bb\u2032 =\u221e are known and cannot be obtained from our formulae.\nFinally, this leads to the field theory predictions\nC123\nC\n(vac)\n123\n=\nJ\nJ1\n1\nn2\u03c02\nsin2(\nn\u03c0J1\nJ\n) \u00b7 (1 + \u03bb\u2032n2)\u22121\/2, (61)\nC\u02dc123\nC\n(vac)\n123\n= \u2212 J\u221a\nJ1J2\n1\nn2\u03c02\nsin2(\nn\u03c0J1\nJ\n) \u00b7 (1 + \u03bb\u2032n2)\u22121\/2. (62)\nIt would be interesting to verify this all-orders prediction from the field theory point of\nview.\nAppendix: Summation formulae\nWe note the useful identity [29]\n\u221e\u2211\nl=\u2212\u221e\n(\u22121)l e\nily\nl + \u03b2\n=\n\u03c0\nsin(\u03b2\u03c0)\ne\u2212i\u03b2y, \u2212\u03c0 < y < \u03c0, (63)\nfrom which one can derive\n\u221e\u2211\nl=1\n(\u22121)l\nl2 \u2212 \u03b22 cos(ly) =\n1\n2\u03b22\n\u2212 \u03c0\n2\u03b2 sin(\u03b2\u03c0)\ncos(\u03b2y), (64)\nand formally\n\u221e\u2211\nl=1\nl2p\nl2 \u2212 \u03b22 = \u2212\n\u03c0\n2\n\u03b22p\u22121 cot(\u03c0\u03b2), p \u2265 1, (65)\n2 After this work appeared, it was argued in [30] that terms proportional to (\u03bb\u2032)3\/2 will typically\nappear on the string side, which is puzzling from the field theory point of view. We do not see such terms\nin our analysis.\n13\n\u221e\u2211\nl=1\nl2p\n(l2 \u2212 \u03b22)(l2 \u2212 \u03b32) = \u2212\n\u03c0\n2(\u03b22 \u2212 \u03b32)(\u03b2\n2p\u22121 cot(\u03b2\u03c0)\u2212 \u03b32p\u22121 cot(\u03b3\u03c0)), p \u2265 1, (66)\n\u221e\u2211\nl=1\nl2p\n(l2 \u2212 \u03b22)2 =\n\u03c0\n4\n[\u03c0\u03b22p\u22122 csc2(\u03b2\u03c0)\u2212 (2p\u2212 1)\u03b22p\u22123 cot(\u03b2\u03c0)], p \u2265 1. (67)\nThe formulae (65), (66) and (67) are understood by an appropriate analytic continuation\nusing zeta function regularization.
