Small\/family hotel\nbusinesses are characterised by a number of specific business processes which generate\nparticular training and educational needs. It is increasingly clear that small businesses are not\nminiature versions of larger once, but they have different structures, priorities and strategic\nobjectives. This paper investigates a number of management areas, such as: planning, strategy\ndevelopment and behaviour in these enterprises, to determine skill and competency gaps. A\nsurvey of small family hotel businesses in Austria was carried out in 2003. Performance,\ngrowth and internal management procedures were assessed to analyse problem areas and to\nidentify the lacking skills in the tourism industry. The results demonstrate areas of tourism\ntraining and education for family hotel businesses.\nKeywords: tourism family business, planning processes, training and education in tourism,\nhotel enterprises.\nIntroduction\nFamily businesses display a relatively low growth rate, compared to non-family firms.\nThey often face typical management and growth problems which call for specific training\nareas such as succession or conflict management issues (Duh, 2000; Ibrahim et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, family firms have particular priorities and structures that often reflect the\nlifestyle of the family wants to follow rather than rational business principles. Other crucial\ntraining areas, such as the creation of business plans and strategic development have been\nneglected in the past although they are largely responsible for the performance and growth of\nan enterprise (Aram and Cowen, 1990; Astrachan and Kolenko, 1994). As the tourism\nindustry is dominated by small and medium sized family enterprises, it serves as an example\nto investigate management processes and behavioural patterns of family entrepreneurs. In\n2003, a survey was conducted in North Tyrol\u2019s hotel industry (Austria) to investigate how\nsmall family tourism businesses organise their planning and how (or if at all) they develop\ngoals and strategies for their businesses. Secondly, the research also investigated how the\nstyle of the planning process does influence the growth or success of a tourism family\nbusiness. Thirdly, the main problems associated with the management of small family hotel\nbusinesses (FHB) were assessed. This paper focuses on the needs of the fragmented tourism\nindustry for training and education, and concludes with a number of core areas for vocational\neducation and training for family businesses.\n3Advantages and disadvantages of family businesses\nRecent literature provided a series of contributions to the field of family business\nmanagement. The discussion of these contributions leads to a number of hypotheses which\nwere tested in the empirical part of the paper. Family businesses definitions focus around\nvariables such as ownership participation or risk assumption. Broader definitions also include\nsocial aspects of entrepreneurial life. Wherever family systems strongly interact with the\nentrepreneurial level of the enterprise system, the enterprise shows a family business\ncharacter. This implies that the development of a family business depends on three factors,\nnamely: the entrepreneurs\u2019 family, ownership, and enterprise system (Gersick et al., 1997).\nThis paper adopts the Upton, Teal, Felan\u2019s definition (2002, p.72). They characterise family\nbusinesses as \u201cbusinesses where the family ownership or control does have a significant\ninfluence on the decision making processes in an enterprise\u201d. Evidently, the relationship\nbetween the firm and the family does create a special entrepreneurial culture and philosophy\nas well as business processes which are unique to family businesses (Hammer and\nHinterhuber, 1994). A number of advantages and disadvantages are therefore emerging\nparticularly for family businesses, regarding their market performance and management and\nthey reflect their unique character. The social sciences literature reports the following\nadvantages:\n1. Personal relationship with enterprise stakeholders: For small enterprises, establishing\npersonal relationships with customers and employees can be a main source of\ncompetitive differentiation. The business dealings of small owner managers are often\nnot based on contracts but on personal relationships. This implies loyalty, personal\nservice, understanding in difficult service encounter situations and potential\npersonalisation of services and products leading to competitive advantages which are\ndifficult to imitate. However, personal relations can also be a burden for the\nentrepreneur (for instance if incapable family members play an active role in the\nfamily enterprise) or a supplier provides unsuitable raw material (Meissner, 1994;\nMorrison et al., 1999; Steinle et al., 2002).\n2. Market niche advantages: Technological developments, especially in the tourism\nindustry, market liberalisation, as well as globalisation (which promote relatively\nhomogenous products) open up new opportunities for small and medium sized\n4enterprises. Market niches, which often have to be ignored by global and\/or big\nenterprises, offer growth chances for small family businesses. Small local businesses\ncan easily identify lead customers\u2019 wishes and should be able to tailor new niche\nproducts for potential future customer segments (Frehse and Peters, 2002).\n3. Flexibility and reaction: Due to the typically flat hierarchy in family businesses,\nmanagement can decide quickly and react immediately to market changes (e.g. in\nterms of customer demand or competitive actions) (Ittner and Larcker, 1996). They\ncan adapt their product on the spot to meet demand requirements.\n4. Flexible labour force: Often family members are much more flexible in their work\narrangements and adopt their lifestyle to the needs of the business. This is particularly\nimportant for hospitality businesses that have a high degree of seasonality and also\nrequire different efforts at different times of the day. For example mornings are\nparticularly busy for family hotels which need to serve breakfasts, arrange check outs\nand payments for departing guests and clean room almost simultaneously. It is getting\nbusy later in the afternoon when new guests arrive and perhaps the hotel operates a\nrestaurants or bar. Unless staff are flexible to work unsociable hours and according to\ndemand it will be difficult and uneconomical for the organisation to meet operational\ndemands. In addition, family members are flexible with payments and often share\nwhat financial resources are available on the longer term, rather than demand monthly\npayments and payment when the cash flow of the organisation cannot support it.\nFinally, it is not unusual for family members to offer unpaid work to support the\nfamily in busy periods whilst they have a different profession and paid employment.\n5. Continuity. Particularly in Europe the reputation of family businesses that have been\noperating for many years is, in the eyes of the customer, a criterion for buying\n(credible) goods or services. The continuity of family businesses and their presence in\nthe market place are perceived to constitute strong social values (Peters, 2001).\nFamily businesses do also face a number of typical disadvantages and problems which receive\nheavy attention in the literature.\n1. Informal business practice and lack of planning: small family businesses often\nhave informal business practices and processes. Although this can be used to their\n5advantage through flexibility and ability to react fast, they often lack a systematic\nmanagement approach. This effectively means lack of procedures which leads to\nvariable performance and improvisation by family members, effecting both\nproduct standardisation and quality control. In addition, book-keeping, accounting\nand financial management are often inaccurate leading to potential revenue loss,\nlack of statistics for rational decision making and miscalculation of critical\nperformance indicators, such as return on investment, variable cost and pricing\nstructures.\n2. Marketing and market research, training and qualification deficits: The\nmanagement functions of strategy development, marketing and quality\nmanagement and technology adaptation are often core deficiencies for small\nhospitality businesses (Buhalis, 1994; Buhalis and Main, 1998). At the operative\nlevel, a study conducted in the Austrian hotel industry in 1999 found severe\nqualification gaps in the area of human resource management (Weiermair, 2000;\nWeiermair et al., 1999). Most family businesses have limited marketing skills and\nfail to employ suitable professionals to ensure that their products are marketed\nappropriately. Their budgets are limited for any kind of marketing campaign and\nthus they find difficult to reach their markets. This is particularly evident in\ntourism and hospitality where clientele often resides in a different country, speaks\ndifferent languages and is bombarded by international brands for its custom. As a\nresult, family hotels depend on intermediaries such as tour operators to reach\npotential clients (Buhalis, 1994; Buhalis and Cooper, 1998).\n3. Financing: While large organisations act as anonymous and autonomous market\nsuppliers, family businesses provide income for a whole family. Family enterprises\nare seen as heritage for following generations. Thus, family entrepreneurs are\nreluctant to foreign investors, which deprives them from capital investments\n(Bornett and Neubauer, 1985; Hennerkes, 1998).\n4. Human resources and family employees: Family members whose labour market\nvalue is poor cannot easily be made redundant. Family relationships often\ntherefore determine business practices. Family entrepreneurs expect family\nmembers to have a high motivation and commitment to the business. Motivation\n6systems or performance oriented incentive systems are thus not installed.\nFurthermore, it is not easy for small family businesses to attract and to finance\nqualified personnel from the labour market, as they often find it strange to interfere\nwith family structures (Tan and Zutshi, 2001; Terberger, 1998).\nMethodology and hypotheses\nA survey on small family businesses in the hotel industry was carried out in the States of\nSalzburg and Northern Tyrol (Austria). The survey analyses the management behaviour in\nsmall-sized family hotel businesses (FHB) and identifies education and training requirements\nthat can contribute to their competitiveness. Having the characteristics of family businesses in\nmind the following hypotheses can be formulated in order to derive implications for education\nand training in the tourism industry:\nResearch Hypotheses\nH1: The degree of formalisation of planning processes in small FHB positively correlates\nwith the success or growth of the business: Entrepreneurship has always played a critical role\nin tourism. In some European countries accommodation and food is the branch of economic\nactivity with the largest number of independent workers. From all apprenticeship schooling\nprograms, among those specialising in accommodation and food related businesses the largest\npercentage number of graduates usually goes into forming their own businesses and\/or taking\nit over from their parents (Tschurtschenthaler, 1998). Thus, entrepreneurial education and\ntraining is a challengeable task for tourism policy where growth and success supporting skills\nshould be transferred. The first hypothesis focuses on the relevance of planning for success\nand growth of the hotel businesses, as stated for family businesses in other industries in the\nsocial sciences literature (Brown, 1995; Hillidge, 1990; Knight, 1993).\nH2: The size of the FHB positively influences the quality of planning processes: In small\nbusinesses, time constraints can be seen as severe growth inhibiting factors, beside the level\nof education and in particular managerial competencies (Morrison et al., 2003). Due to the\ninefficient firm size, entrepreneurs have to face an enormous amount of operative work load\nand continuous \u201cfire-fighting\u201d. Thus, they do not find the time to develop plans for the future\n(Beyer et al., 2003; Tschurtschenthaler, 2004, p.41).\n7H3: The overall satisfaction of the entrepreneur in small FHBs with his\/her profession\nstrongly depends upon the quality of interaction between family and business system: As these\nsystems are heavily linked and accompanied with conflicts, e.g. between financial business\ndevelopment vs. family living standard; business leadership style vs. family coordination;\nself-realization of (risk oriented) entrepreneurs vs. family safeguarding. There should be\ntherefore a positive correlation between the entrepreneur\u2019s satisfaction and his\/her satisfaction\nwith interrelations between family and business system (Ibrahim\/Ellis, 2003).\nH4: Growth and success of small FHB are positively correlated with the entrepreneurs\u2019\nwillingness to cooperate with partners in the industry: Family entrepreneurs are known as\ndefending their family-owned business against family outsiders and to maintain the enterprise\nas a heritage for the succeeding kids (Peters, 2004).\nH5: In Small FHB the entrepreneur dominates innovation processes: Especially in service\nindustries, the overlap of family and family business systems is obvious as in the service\ndelivery process the family is seen as a core differentiator in the market (Ibrahim et al., 2003;\nReisinger, 2001). The owner\/manager or entrepreneur is the dominant factor in the process of\ndeveloping new ideas and should be seen as a main target segment for training and education\nin the small-sized structured hospitality industry (Li et al., 2003; Tschurtschenthaler, 2004).\nResearch design and execution\nFrom June to August 2003, 240 family businesses in two Austrian tourism destinations\nwere randomly selected from a tourism destination brochure listing all the hotels in these\nareas. Only hotels (>30 beds) and restaurants (full time businesses) that were family owned\nwere included in the survey. A qualitative interview was carried out with 4 hoteliers to\nidentify critical management areas of family hotel businesses. A three page questionnaire was\nthen developed and tested with a pilot sample of 4 hoteliers. The majority of variables were\nclosed questions, and most of the answer options were five point Likert-scaled attributes. 240\nquestionnaires were personally distributed in the two destinations and collected several days\nlater. A total of 156 questionnaires (65%) could be used for statistical analysis. The sample\nconsists of hotels with an average capacity of 72.3 beds spread across a range of 30-150 beds,\nas shown in Table 1. A total of 105 firms have been operating for more than ten years.\n8Table 1 Categories of bed capacity of the survey sample\nBed capacity Percent\n< 30 19.4%\n31-60 35.7%\n61-100 26.4%\n> 100 18.5%\nThe Austrian Hotels Association classifies accommodation businesses with a five star\nranking. A total of 112 properties covered by this study were classified as hotels, of which\n7.1% were two-star, 63.4% three-stars, and 30% four- or five-star hotels. The questionnaire\nwas only completed by family members who are either entrepreneurs or main decision makers\nwithin the enterprise. There were a number of statements in the questionnaire based on a five-\npoint Likert scale which display management areas, such as employee management, co-\noperation management and strategic planning in the family business. In addition, the overall\ndata about the attributes of the hotel and demographic characteristics of the respondents were\ncollected. K-means cluster analysis was used to separate significantly differing planning\nprocedures. Descriptive analysis and contingency tests were used to test the above formulated\nhypotheses.\nResults\nFamily business managers were asked to indicate advantages and disadvantages of family\nenterprises (see table 2). The results are in line with the social sciences literature. One third of\nall respondents perceived a higher work motivation as a main advantage and 20% of the\nrespondents see personalisation of services as a major advantage of being a family business.\nTable 2 Advantages and disadvantages of a family firm in the eyes of the entrepreneur\nAdvantages of a family firm (in % of responses)\nHigher motivation to work 33.3%\nProducts\/services are personalised for the customer 19.1%\nFamily firms have a convenient, manageable size 15.4%\nFlexibility 14.8%\nIndependence of the business 10.5%\nSaving labour cost\/wages 6.8%\nDisadvantages of a family firm (in % of responses)\nHigher work load in a family business 49.5%\nConflict within the family and\/or generations 20.2%\nNo separation between private and professional life 10.1%\nRigid traditions 9.2%\nSmall firm size 7.3%\nFamily liability and guarantee for the firm capital 3.7%\nMore interesting in terms of identifying training needs are the perceived disadvantages of a\nfamily business: Half of the sample thinks that entrepreneurs have to invest more work and\n9time when the enterprise is a family business. In addition, 20.2% of the entrepreneurs indicate\nconflicts within the family or between family generations as a severe disadvantage of family\nbusinesses. This is particularly evident in innovative issues such as IT, marketing and product\ndevelopment where typically younger members of the family push for change. Furthermore,\n10% of the family business entrepreneurs perceive the interaction between the family and the\nfamily business system as a core disadvantage in their enterprises.\nIn the qualitative pilot test several key areas of family business management could be\nidentified as critical for their performance, including human resource management,\ncooperation management, and strategy planning. In addition the influence of the family\nbusiness system on the entrepreneurs\u2019 job satisfaction was also identified as a key factor.\nHuman resource management: the family business entrepreneurs had to answer eight\nquestions which displayed the degree of employee integration into the family business\nmanagement. The evaluating statements were:\n1. We have installed regularly employee meetings\n2. Employee meetings are useful to solve problems in the firm (problem solver)\n3. Employees are helping in developing new ideas. (idea generator)\n4. Employees can contribute their opinion for management decisions of family\nmembers. (decider)\n5. Employees help developing plans within the firm. (plan developer)\n6. Employees can give their advice to the family business management. (advisor)\n7. Employees are helping to develop new products. (product developer)\n8. The firm development is strongly influenced by the cooperation between core\nemployees and family business members. (family\/employee relationship)\nFigure 1 shows the evaluation of these statements by two size categories of hotels. There are\nstrong differences between the two size groups of hotels. The bigger the hotel the higher the\nintegration of employees into core management processes of the family business (p<.05). This\nis probably because larger properties have to employ more staff and better qualified\nprofessionals such as chefs or accountants, who do often support the decision making process.\n10\nFigure 1 Employee integration of hotel with more and less than 90 beds\n4,5\n4,4\n4,3\n3,9\n3,2\n3,2\n3,6\n2,9\n4,1\n3,9\n3,8\n3,4\n2,6\n2,9\n3,1\n2,4\n2 2,5 3 3,5 4 4,5 5\nfamily\/employee relationship\nproblem solver\nidea generator\nemployee meetings\nplan developer\ndecider\nproduct developer\nadvisor\n> 90 beds\n< 90 beds\nNote: 1=absolutely no, 5=absolutely yes\nInterestingly, the advisor and decider roles achieved low scores demonstrating that families\nkeep those roles for themselves and often fail to consult with staff or to delegate decision\nmaking. Family businesses show a high interest in integrating core employees and establish\nlong term collaboration. The bigger the business (measured in bed capacity), the more time\nand money are going to be invested in the training of firm employees. Those hotels which\ndisplay strong profit increases within the last 5 years stated a higher willingness to offer\nresources for internal or external employee training and education (p<.05).\nCooperation: As the sample consisted of small enterprises it was of special interest if family\nbusinesses are willing to cooperate and how their cooperation behaviour influences the\nsuccess of the enterprises. In doing so, the entrepreneurs evaluated the statements summarised\nin Figure 2 regarding past, existing and planned cooperation.\n11\nFigure 2 Statements indicating the openness for cooperation of family businesses\n4,13\n2,65\n2,3\n2,14\n2,04\n0 0,5 1 1,5 2 2,5 3 3,5 4 4,5\nThe firm should be kept in family\nhands!\nPast cooperations with travel\nagencies\/operators\nCooperations are planned\nExisting cooperations with other\nfirms\nPast cooperations with other firms\nNote: five-point Likert scale, 1=\u2018absolutely no\u2019 to 5=\u2018absolutely yes\u2019\nThe average evaluation of existing, past or planned cooperation with other firms is generally\nquite low. Family businesses want to have control over their business and to keep the\nownership in the hands of the family members (mean value = 4.13). It is not surprising that\nthe size of a family business is positively related to the entrepreneurs\u2019 willingness to\ncooperate with other enterprises (p=.01). However, the relationship between willingness to\ncooperate and the success of the enterprises in the sample should be examined. Although,\nthese results do not surprise experienced researchers, it is still the case that family hotels still\ndo not understand their need to collaborate with other firms and to establish long term\npartnerships with suppliers of raw material, professionals that can undertake some core\nbusiness functions such as accounting, legal representation, IT support, recruitment as well as\nmarketing and public relationships (Buhalis, 1999). They also need strong collaboration with\nonline and offline distributors such as travel agencies, tour operators, internet aggregators, and\ndestination management organisations. Paradoxically, it is the larger firms that appreciate the\nneeds for these partnerships. Smaller hotels should depend heavily on outsourcing and on\ndeveloping a \u201cco- destiny\u201d with their key partners, since they lack expertise and resources to\naddress these functions in-house. However, they often fail to appreciate the importance of\npartnerships. Hence, they miss the opportunity to develop a value system where each\nparticipant will support and strengthen their own competitiveness and the position of partners.\nThe data provides evidence for the assumption that those enterprises which actually cooperate\nwith other enterprises do have significantly higher profit growth rates than the other\nenterprises in the sample (p<.05). In addition, the high-professional planners are significantly\nmore open for future cooperation than those family businesses which can be labelled as low-\nprofessional planners (p=.019). Thus, H4 is an admissible hypothesis.\n12\nStrategy development and planning: A total of 107 enterprises replied that they do create\nplans for business development: 68.6% of these family businesses have a written plan, 31.4%\nnever capture their future plans in writing. Comparing the average profit development within\nthe last ten years it can be observed that the \u2018enterprises with written plans\u2019 show a better\nprofit improvement than those enterprises which do not write down their future plans (p<.05).\nAnalysing all enterprises in the sample it becomes evident how professional the planning\nprocess in the family firm is. The following six statements describe the planning behaviour of\nthe FHB:\n1. We always write down our plans.\n2. We develop a long term plan.\n3. We use our business plan to evaluate our employee performance.\n4. We use our business plan to control the success and growth development.\n5. We develop internal enterprise indices.\n6. Our business plans are IT supported and linked.\nAccording to these statements it was possible to carry out a cluster analysis where it is\ntested if the sample consists of differing enterprise clusters which display a significantly\ndifferent planning behaviour (k-means cluster analysis). From 95 answers about the\nprofessionalism of the planning process the following distribution can be derived: 27.4% are\n\u2018high-professional planers\u2019, 45.2% \u2018mid-professional planers\u2019 and 27.4% can be interpreted as\n\u2018low-professional planners\u2019.\n13\nFigure 3 Three clusters of family business planning (k-means cluster analysis)\n6: IT supported\n5: indices develop.\n4: success control\n3: employee eval.\n2: longterm plans\n1: written plans\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\nclusters:\nlow-professional\nplanners\nhigh-professional\nplanners\nmid-professional\nplanners\n(measured on a five-point Likert scale, 1=\u2018absolutely no\u2019 to 5=\u2018absolutely yes\u2019)\nComparing the growth rates of these three groups paints an interesting picture. There is a\nsignificant difference between those enterprises labelled low-\u2018professional planners\u2019 and the\ntwo other cluster groups in terms of scale growth (measured as beds per hotel enterprise)\n(p=.034). Thus, H1 can be affirmed for this sample, although there is no significant difference\nbetween the mid and high-professional planners.\nThe three clusters show significant differences in all of the variables which express the quality\nof the planning behaviour shown in Figure 3 (chi-squares are all <.01). Not surprisingly, the\nhigh-professional planning enterprises have an average of 22 staff members and are\nsignificantly bigger than the low-professionals (average of seven employees). The so called\n\u2018mid-professional planners\u2019 employ around 14 staff members. Thus, H2 can be affirmed as\nthe size of the FHB positively influences the quality of the planning processes of the observed\nenterprises. In addition, the \u2018low-professional\u2019 group displays a lower profit growth within the\nlast ten years of enterprise development, than the high-professional family businesses\n(p=.054). Naturally, those enterprises which are more professional in developing strategic\nplans for their family business are more successful.\n14\nEntrepreneurial satisfaction: H3 postulates a strong relationship between the entrepreneurs\u2019\njob satisfaction and the existence of planning processes in the firm. Planning is seen as\nentrepreneurial action which leads to controllable input\/output relations and thus to a\nmeasurement of success or failure. The entrepreneurs were asked as to how satisfied they feel\nwith their current profession. In addition, the satisfaction with entrepreneurial management\nareas, such as planning, product development and strategy orientation was assessed.\nFurthermore, their evaluation of the interaction and cooperation between the family system\nand the business system was examined as is it assumed it may strongly influence the overall\nsatisfaction.\nTable 2 Correlation between the satisfaction with the entrepreneurial profession and key management\nareas.\nSatisfaction with cooperation\nbetween\nfamily and\nbusiness\nsystem.\nplanning\nprocesses.\nstrategic\norientation of\nthe enterprise.\ndevelopment\nof new\nproducts and\nservices.\nthe current profession\nas entrepreneur\nCorrelation\nRears\n.411 .337 .342 .467\nsig 2-tail. .000 .000 .000 .000\nN = between 138 and 147. Satisfaction level was assessed by a five point Likert-scale 1=very satisfied,\n5= totally unsatisfied\nTable 2 shows the satisfaction statements which should be answered by the family\nentrepreneur on a five-point Likert scale (1=very satisfied, 5=totally unsatisfied). The\ncorrelation coefficients show positive relations between main management areas and the\nentrepreneurs\u2019 overall job satisfaction. Thus, it can be postulated that strong positive\ncorrelations exist between the quality of interaction of the two systems \u2018business\u2019 and \u2018family\u2019\nand the satisfaction with the current profession in the family business (r = +.411). In addition,\nthe overall job satisfaction is highly influenced by the possibility to change things in terms of\ndeveloping new products or services in the enterprise. Thus, it can be assumed that the option\nfor creativity is a crucial element of family entrepreneurship.\nIn a final step entrepreneurs were asked to indicate how and through whom new ideas or\ninnovations emerge in their family businesses. Again, a number of statements which attempt\nto assess the innovation sources could be evaluated by the entrepreneur (Likert-scale from\n1=absolutely no, 5=absolutely yes). As hypothesis 4 postulates, the entrepreneurs sees himself\n15\n(4.37) and his\/her family (3.94) as the main driving force of innovation in the business.\nInterestingly enough, employees are not regarded as a main source of innovations (2.8).\nNevertheless, those FHB which actively involve their employees in product development\nprocesses have been more successful in terms of profit and bed growth in the last five years\n(p<.05). The respondents also indicated customer wishes (4.12) and tourism fairs or vacations\n(3.1) are also important external impulses of ideas or potential innovations.\nAfter stressing out the main survey findings we will discuss a number of implications and\noutlook for training and education measures for small FHBs.\nImplications for Education and Training in Tourism Family Businesses\nIt is evident from the analysis that apart from a small percentage of businesses that are not\ninterested for profitability, most entrepreneurs try hard to operate their businesses, keep the\nfamily together and plan for the future. However, it is evident that many are not qualified or\ntrained to be able to manage their businesses professionally and achieve suitable results. In\naddition, many entrepreneurs are attracted in tourism for lifestyle rather profit\/growth reasons.\nTherefore, the peculiarities of small FHB call for training programs which focus on\nsuccession issues and stakeholders\u2019 conflict management (Ibrahim et al., 2003). The results of\nthis survey also underline additional training and education areas for FHB entrepreneurs and\nmanaging staff as well as employees.\nThe integration of employees into the enterprise development process in stakeholder roles as\nco-deciders, co-advisors, co-plan developers or co-idea generators was identified as a success\nfactor for the growth of FHB. Nevertheless, family businesses remain reluctant in sharing\ntheir business or business decisions with employees in order to keep the business in family\nhands. Family members which lead the business have to learn how to handle, involve and lead\n(non-family) key employees. To do this, the concept of intrapreneurship which empowers\nemployees to progressively develop the product\/service according to the customer and\nentrepreneurs\u2019 needs (Honig, 2001) should be a main part on the agenda of FHB\nentrepreneurship training programs. Employees also need training to cope with family\nstructures and to be able to develop arguments that can convince the family. Issues emerging\nfrom delegation and expansion\/growth management should also be covered.\n16\nFHB are reluctant to cooperate with other industry firms or to delegate management tasks\nfrom the family system to the business system. Typically, only family members bear\nresponsibility for strategic and operational management tasks. Again, human resource\nmanagement and the management of transition should be core training areas for FHBs which\nare growth and profit oriented. The complexity of the tourism product also calls for the\ndevelopment of service management instruments which allow entrepreneurs to analyse\ncomplex service processes (e.g. flowcharting, blueprinting). Thus, the entrepreneur has to\nlearn to write a script which serves the right service\/product at the right time and location, in\nthe right quantity, and quality (Brunner-Sperdin\/Peters, 2004; Peters\/Weiermair, 2000). A\nprerequisite for an optimal usage of these instruments is an effective human resource\nmanagement process. However, if entrepreneurs are not willing to empower the front line\npersonnel, it will not be possible to optimise service encounter processes (Fitzsimmons and\nFitzsimmons, 2003). Instead of doing so, entrepreneurs are forced to act as front line\npersonnel themselves, reducing their available time for strategic planning and development\n(Collins et al., 2003).\nInnovation potential in hospitality and tourism enterprises mainly lies in the areas of service\nand product development, organisation, marketing and market research (Ullmann, 2000). The\ndevelopment of products or services is one of the key areas of training for FHB entrepreneurs.\nTogether with the empowerment strategy they should learn how to plan the service delivery\nprocess instead of improvising the \u2018moment of truth\u2019 (Normann, 1996). Another training area\nto be improved is the management of cooperation. Family businesses often neglect the option\nof firm growth or product improvement through cooperation processes. They should be\ntrained to explore the possibilities of increasing economies of scope and to extent their value\nsystem by collaborating with partners that can improve their organisational performance and\nmarket research. Training and education programs can transfer best practice approaches of\nformer successful cooperations to promote cooperation and to motivate entrepreneurs to open\ntheir business for new forms of growth. For example IT based marketing through a\ncomprehensive multi-channel strategy can support firm expansion or its global reach.\nFinally, strategic planning is another success factor for growth. The high professional\nplanning FHB is more successful and growth oriented. In addition, the entrepreneurs who face\na clear planned enterprise future are more satisfied with their current position in the enterprise\n(p<.05). As the entrepreneurs\u2019 job satisfaction level strongly influences the growth of the\n17\nfamily enterprise, entrepreneurial programs should provide training units which focus on\naspects of entrepreneurs\u2019 and family members\u2019 personal self realization. For both family and\nbusiness system expectations, goals and strategies should be disclosed to maintain a\ntransparent and controllable family business development.\nConclusion\nFrom this research, it is possible to suggest, that important key areas of family business\ntraining are strategy development and planning; the management of cooperation and\npartnership; the development and conceptualization of new products or services; and the\nempowerment of employees within the tourism family business. As entrepreneurs are heavily\ninvolved in operational management they should learn to sometimes refrain from the daily\nbusiness to refresh their thoughts and to perform some long-term business development.\nTraining programmes should therefore be developed to address the specific requirements of\nthe family business. To facilitate learning and education, the family system should be\n(geographically) separated from the business system to maintain best training results.\nUnderstanding the benefits of \u201cprofessionalisation\u201d of family businesses, through\ncomprehensive training will assist small and family hotels to identify their strategic\ncompetitive advantage and to develop their strategic plan towards achieving their full\npotential. This will support their competitiveness and will enable them to sustain or grow their\nbusiness in the future.\n18\nReferences\nAram, J. D. and Cowen, S. S.
