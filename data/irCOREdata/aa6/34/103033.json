In England the\nprevalence of obesity increased almost threefold between\n1980 and 2004, with present numbers indicating that\n>60% of the population are overweight and approximately\n24% are obese(2). If this rate of growth continues it is\nexpected that by 2010 more than one in four adults in\nEngland will be obese, approaching the levels of obesity\ncurrently seen in the USA(3). This steady increase in the\nprevalence of obesity has been accompanied, on one hand,\nby an increase in the consumption of energy-dense food\nand, on the other hand, by a reduction in physical activity\n(PA) levels(4,5).\nIt is a paradox that obesity is increasing while overall\nenergy intake (EI) has been falling over the past 20 years\nin the UK(6). It has been proposed that a reduction in PA\nlevels together with an inability of individuals to down-\nregulate EI to a similar extent in order to match the\ndecreased energy expenditure (EE) may be the dominant\nfactors in promoting obesity(7). It has been shown that the\nadoption of a sedentary lifestyle is not followed, at least\nin the short to medium term, by a compensatory decrease\nin EI, with consequent positive energy balance (EB)(8,9).\nThis outcome does not mean, however, that physical\ninactivity alone explains this epidemic, or that diet has\nno role in the aetiology of obesity(10\u201312). However, it\nis undeniable that PA has decreased over the past few de-\ncades, driven by dramatic changes in lifestyle(6). The cur-\nrent recommendations for adults, shared by the Department\nof Health in the UK and the American College of Sports\nand Medicine, are to accumulate at least 30 min of mod-\nerate PA on most, preferably all, days of the week(13\u201315).\nAbbreviations: PA, physical activity; EI, energy intake; EE, energy expenditure; EB, energy balance; GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1; HEP, high-energy\npreload; LEP, low-energy preload; PYY, polypeptide YY; PP, pancreatic polypeptide; RRS, restrained revised scale; DEBQ, Dutch eating-behaviour\nquestionnaire; TFEQ, Three-factor eating questionnaire.\n*Corresponding author: Catia Martins, fax + 44 1483 686401, email C.Martins@surrey.ac.uk\nProceedings of the Nutrition Society (2008), 67, 28\u201341 DOI:10.1017\/S0029665108005995\ng The Authors 2008\nHowever, in England only 25% of women and 37% of\nmen were achieving that target in 1998(15). The situation in\nother European countries is no better(4).\nEating behaviour is a complex phenomenon encom-\npassing the size and frequency of eating episodes and\neveryday food choices, which together determine total\nenergy and macronutrient intake, and is the result of con-\nstant, physiological and environmental inputs(16,17). The\nlatter are especially important, and it is accepted that\nthe physiological mechanisms that control food intake can\nbe easily overridden by strong social and environmental\nfactors(10). Appetite is a subjective concept used to explain\nthe control of food intake and can be defined as a range of\nvariables associated with food consumption that predict\nnormal eating behaviour(16,18).\nAt the physiological level appetite and food intake\nare under the control of both the brain and a plethora of\nhormones produced mainly by the gastrointestinal tract, but\nalso by the pancreas, adrenal glands and adipose tissue(19).\nThese two types of regulation are known respectively\nas central and peripheral. It is well established that the\nhypothalamic region of the brain plays a key role in the\ncentral regulation of eating behaviour in human subjects\nand is constantly receiving and processing neural, meta-\nbolic and endocrine signals from the periphery, enabling\nit to adjust not only EI but also EE. The area within the\nhypothalamus most actively involved in the regulation of\nfeeding is the arcuate nucleus, which expresses receptors\nfor many of the hormones and peptides known to be\ninvolved in eating behaviour(20).\nWhile fasting leads to the release of the orexigenic\nhormone ghrelin, feeding stimulates the coordinated pro-\nduction and release of several satiety hormones such as\nglucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY) and\npancreatic polypeptide (PP). Some of these hormones are\ndirectly involved in gastric emptying, while others have\nlonger-lasting postprandial effects that will affect not only\nsatiation (or meal termination) but also satiety (inter-meal\ninterval)(21,22).\nA second category of peripheral signals that influences\nfood intake includes hormones, the secretion of which is\ndirectly proportional to the amount of body fat: insulin\nreleased by the pancreas; leptin released mainly by the\nadipose tissue. In contrast to satiety signals these adiposity\nsignals are tonically active, providing constant information\nto the hypothalamus about the state of energy stores.\nLeptin has been shown to reduce food intake and body\nweight and increase EE(21). When fat stores are reduced\nleptin production is down regulated, leading to the stimu-\nlation of orexigenic neurons expressing neuropeptide Y\nand agouti-related peptide and the inhibition of anorectic\nneurons expressing propiomelanocortin(23,24). Apart from\nacting directly as adiposity signals, both leptin and insulin\ncan regulate body weight indirectly, by modulating the\nsensitivity of the brain to satiety signals and therefore\ndetermining the total amount of food eaten at an individual\nmeal(25).\nApart from physiological processes, appetite is regulated\nby external stimuli arising from food and the surrounding\nenvironment. Environmental, psychological, social and cul-\ntural stimuli have been shown to exert powerful effects\non food intake(26). Moreover, food intake is also under\nhedonic control(27), activated by the availability of pal-\natable food(28). The increased availability of highly-\npalatable food in present-day society may lead to the\nchronic activation of the hedonic appetite system and\nexplain why an increased number of individuals need to\nrestrain their food intake in order to maintain or lose\nweight. Dietary restraint has, therefore, become an impor-\ntant behavioural concept.\nIn the face of the current obesity pandemic, the wide-\nspread levels of physical inactivity and the increased\navailability of highly-palatable energy-dense food, it is\ntherefore important to understand how exercise (both in the\nshort and long term) and dietary restraint impact on ap-\npetite and eating behaviour in order to achieve a better\nknowledge of the aetiology and\/or potential treatments of\nobesity. The present review will be confined to these\naspects.\nExercise and appetite\nEffects of acute exercise on appetite, energy intake\nand energy balance\nThe majority of the studies have shown that acute exercise\ndoes not increase hunger or EI(29\u201334), even when vigorous\nexercise is taken(35), and so exercise is able to induce a\nshort-term negative EB. In fact, vigorous exercise has been\nfound to suppress hunger acutely, a phenomenon that has\nbeen described as \u2018exercise-induced anorexia\u2019(31,36),\nalthough this phenomenon is short-lived and is unlikely\nto have any marked effect on EI(18,29,36,37). However, some\nstudies have shown an increase in appetite sensations(38),\nan increase in subsequent EI(39\u201341) or even a decrease in\nEI(32) in response to acute exercise. This lack of con-\nsistency is probably a result of differences in methodology,\ni.e. the intensity of exercise(29), nutritional state(42), gen-\nder(43), macronutrient composition of the test meal(44) and\nthe time lag between exercise and eating(39).\nKing and colleagues have suggested that the inability of\nsome studies to show a beneficial effect of acute exercise\non EB derives from the fact that they do not account for\nthe energy cost associated with exercise(35). Even if acute\nexercise leads to a compensatory increase in absolute EI,\na short-term negative EB can still be achieved if relative\nEI, i.e. EI after accounting for the EE induced by exercise,\nis reduced (when compared with a resting condition). A\nreview paper by Blundell and colleagues has concluded\nthat in the short (1\u20132 d) to medium term (7\u201316 d) exercise\ncan produce a negative EB, with no substantial compen-\nsatory responses in EI being observed(45). In the long term\n(>16 d) EI starts to increase, although the observed com-\npensation is usually partial and incomplete, accounting for\napproximately 30% of the energy cost associated with\nexercise(45).\nIn fact, exercise has been shown to be more effective\nthan dieting in inducing a negative EB in the short term.\nHubert and colleagues have studied the effects of acute\nenergy deficits created by dietary manipulation or exercise\non appetite responses and subsequent EI in unrestrained\nwomen(46). It was found that hunger ratings (P<0.005),\nPostgraduate Symposium 29\nad libitum EI at a buffet lunch (P<0.05) and food cravings\nduring the day (P<0.05) are significantly increased\nfollowing a low-energy breakfast compared with a high-\nenergy breakfast, whilst exercise fails to induce any sig-\nnificant effect on these variables, consequently resulting in\na negative EB.\nEffects of chronic exercise on energy intake, energy\nbalance and body weight\nAlthough in the short to medium term exercise can produce\na negative EB, the general view in relation to the impact of\nlong-term exercise on EB is that in the absence of energy\nrestriction only very modest results are observed in terms\nof weight loss(47). This finding does not mean, however,\nthat exercise should not be present in all interventions\nintended to tackle the problem of obesity. In fact, although\ndiet alone may seem at the first glance to be a more effective\nway of losing weight in the short term, its efficacy in the long\nterm is questionable. In a recent comprehensive analysis\nof thirty-one long-term studies of the effect of energy\nrestriction on weight loss it was found that despite an initial\n5\u201310% weight loss in the first 6 months of dieting one-third\nto two-thirds of the subjects regained more weight than they\nhad originally lost within 4\u20135 years(48).\nMany factors may help to explain the relative inefficacy\nof exercise as a weight-loss strategy. First, exercise leads\nto an improvement in body composition with the progress-\nive substitution of fat by fat-free mass(49), which clearly\nunderestimates its impact on weight loss. Second, when\nEB is disturbed by exercise, several physiological and\nbehavioural compensatory mechanisms are activated in\norder to achieve a new steady-state(50). Weight loss is\nassociated with a compensatory reduction in total BMR,\nprobably driven by the changes in body composition in\nfavour of decreased fat-free mass(51). Moreover, as maxi-\nmal O2 uptake increases with exercise training, a lower EE\nis achieved for the same volume of exercise. Finally,\nas body weight decreases the net exercise-induced EE is\nalso reduced, especially for weight-bearing exercise(50).\nHowever, it is unlikely that these physiological and meta-\nbolic mechanisms alone are responsible for the attainment\nof a new steady-state by reversing the uncoupling between\nEI and EE. Behavioural mechanisms are probably more\nimportant(34,52). Two major behavioural mechanisms can\nreverse the energy imbalance created by exercise: a com-\npensatory increase in EI and\/or a reduction in EE, probably\nthrough down-regulation of spontaneous PA (non-exercise\nEE)(53,54). The increase in EI may result from increased\nhunger or from a more relaxed dietary regimen, especially\ntowards more-energy-dense foods, because of the wide-\nspread belief that the energy cost of exercise can offset\ndietary indulgences(46). However, if EI does not increase,\nor the increase is insufficient, and EE is maintained con-\nstant a new steady-state may still be achieved (although it\nwould take longer) through the changes in metabolism\ndiscussed earlier(54).\nDespite the general view that exercise is a rather ineffi-\ncient strategy to lose weight, a great variability is usually\nfound among studies, with reports of weight loss, main-\ntenance of weight or even a small weight gain after a PA\nintervention(55). Although methodological differences\namong studies are likely to explain some of this variation,\ni.e. the macronutrient composition of the diet and the\ncharacteristics of the exercise intervention (type, duration,\nfrequency and intensity)(55), it has been suggested that the\nlarge inter-individual variation in the response of body\nweight to exercise is a result of differences in the coupling\nbetween EI and EE(7). Unfortunately, most of the studies\ninvestigating the impact of chronic exercise on EB are\nlimited by the fact that neither EI nor EE were controlled\nor accurately measured. Free-living subjects tend to up\nregulate their EI in response to exercise, even if instructed\nnot to, and often do not comply with the exercise pre-\nscription(56\u201358). Moreover, an increase in total EE induced\nby exercise often rests on the assumption that normal\nactivity throughout the rest of the day remains unchanged\nor increases(55), an area that remains controversial(59,60).\nHowever, there is enough evidence to show that substantial\nweight loss can be achieved with exercise alone if EI is\nmaintained constant and compliance with exercise is\ngood(51,61).\nA recent review has demonstrated that exercise is crucial\nin preventing weight gain or regain in the long term(47),\ntherefore reinforcing the importance of incorporating\nexercise in any plan designed to reduce or maintain body\nweight in the long term. It can be hypothesized that the\nbeneficial effect of exercise on weight maintenance results\nfrom an improvement in appetite control. It may be that\nexercise leads to a better coupling between EI and EE in\nthe long term that ensures that body weight is maintained(1)\nor to a more sensitive eating behaviour in response to\nprevious EI(2).\nEffects of exercise on appetite control\nIt has been shown that the coupling between EI and EE is\ndependent on habitual PA levels. As early as 1956 Mayer\nand collaborators examined the coupling between EI and\nEE in a male population of mill workers in West Bengal\n(India) by comparing EI in different groups according\nto the level of PA in their jobs(62). A good correlation was\nfound between EI and energy requirements, but the rise\nin EI with increasing levels of PA was only observed\nwithin a specific range of PA that the authors designated\nas \u2018normal activity range\u2019. It was found that if PA is below\nthat range, as happens in sedentary individuals, a decrease\nin EE is not followed by a proportional decrease in EI, but\ninstead by an increase, therefore leading to a positive EB\nand weight gain. This finding provides an explanation for\nthe increased body weight observed in the sedentary indi-\nviduals compared with the more-active individuals(62). It\nmay be hypothesized, therefore, that the coupling between\nEI and EE, and in a broader context appetite control\nin general, is disrupted at low levels of PA. This outcome\ncould help to explain why it is so hard to maintain body\nweight after a weight-loss intervention with a sedentary\nlifestyle, since the body is not able to down regulate EI\nto match the low levels of EE.\nThis and other cross-sectional studies showing a tight\ncoupling between EI and EE at high levels of PA(18)\nsuggest that exercise might sensitize the physiological\n30 C. Martins et al.\nmechanisms involved in appetite control. Evidence for the\nrole of exercise on short-term appetite control has been\nprovided by King and colleagues, who have shown that\nactive males are able to detect differences in the energy\ncontent of covertly-manipulated drinks after an exercise\nchallenge and to adjust for the difference at a subsequent\nmeal, achieving an almost perfect energy compensation(63).\nFurther support for this hypothesis has come from a\nstudy that has shown a better compensatory response to\ncovert preload energy manipulation in active men com-\npared with sedentary men(64). Using a cross-over design\nhealthy lean men were randomized to a low-energy (LEP)\nor high-energy (HEP) preload on two different occasions\nfollowed 60 min after the preload by an ad libitum buffet\nlunch. The buffet EI following the LEP and HEP was not\nsignificantly different in the sedentary group, denoting\na deficient homeostatic feedback control of hunger and\nsatiety that if maintained over time could lead to energy\nimbalances; in contrast, an almost perfect energy compen-\nsation (90%) was observed in the exercise group, who\ndown regulated the buffet EI after the HEP. However, a\ncross-sectional design does not prove causality and it is\npossible that the better energy compensation observed in\nthe active group may be a result of other factors such as\nlifestyle or cognitive factors and be unrelated to their PA\nlevels.\nThe effect of long-term exercise on the sensitivity\nof compensation in response to previous EI has recently\nbeen assessed using a more robust longitudinal design(65).\nShort-term appetite control, using the preload\u2013test meal\nparadigm, was measured before and after a 6-week\nmoderate-intensity exercise programme in unrestrained\nnormal-weight sedentary individuals (eleven men and\nfourteen women). Energy compensation was measured\nusing a protocol similar to that described by Long and\ncolleagues(64), with the participants being given a HEP or\nLEP on two separate occasions and EI measured 1 h later\nat an ad libitum buffet meal. An improvement in appetite\ncontrol was observed with the exercise intervention, with a\nmore-sensitive eating behaviour in response to previous\nEI, both acutely at lunch time and for the next 24 h. While\nat baseline participants were unable to adjust their sub-\nsequent EI in response to preload-energy manipulation,\nafter the exercise intervention their EI after the HEP was\nfound to be significantly lower than that after the LEP\n(Figs 1 and 2)(65). These findings suggest that the role\nof exercise on EB extends beyond its ability merely to\nincrease EE, and includes an indirect effect that modulates\nfood intake towards a more \u2018sensitive\u2019 eating behaviour in\nresponse to previous EI.\nThe mechanisms targeted by exercise that may help\nto explain this improvement in short-term appetite control\nare likely to fall into three categories: long term, including\nleptin and insulin; intermediate, including post-absorptive\nsignals associated with macronutrient oxidation such as\nglucose and NEFA levels; short-term satiety signals aris-\ning from the gastrointestinal tract in response to food\nintake(16), such as cholecystokinin, GLP-1 and PYY(21).\nHowever, no significant changes in fasting insulin, glucose,\nTAG or NEFA levels or insulin sensitivity were found with\nthe exercise intervention, and leptin levels are unlikely to\nhave changed(65) as no significant changes in body weight\nor composition were observed with the 6-week exercise\nintervention(66). Changes in the release of satiety hormones\nby the gastrointestinal tract are, therefore, likely to be\ninvolved in the improvement in short-term appetite control\nobserved in this study.\nEffects of exercise on appetite-related hormones\nAlthough the effects of exercise on leptin and ghrelin have\nbeen extensively studied and the conclusion drawn that\n0\n1050\n2090\n3140\n4180\nBaseline End\nEn\ner\ngy\n (k\nJ)\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\nFig. 1.

(From Martins et al.(65).)\nPostgraduate Symposium 31\nexercise, in the absence of weight loss, does not induce\nany significant increase in the plasma levels of these two\nhormones(66,67), few studies have looked at the impact of\nboth acute and chronic exercise on circulating levels of\nsatiety gut peptides known to be involved in appetite\ncontrol (Table 1).\nThe little evidence currently available suggests that\nacute exercise increases fasting plasma levels of chole-\ncystokinin(68) and GLP-1(69,70), although these latter two\nstudies were performed in athletes and in the study of\nO\u2019Connor and colleagues an identical increase in GLP-1\nplasma levels was also observed during resting(70). Acute\nexercise has also been shown to increase plasma PP levels,\nnot only whilst fasting(69,71,72) but also postprandially(73),\nalthough the increase is dependent on the intensity of\nexercise(74). Chronic exercise, on the other hand, has been\nshown not to increase fasting cholecystokinin levels in\nactive men(68) but to induce a slight increase in fasting\nPP plasma levels as well as in its postprandial peak(75)\nin previously-sedentary males. Interestingly, the magnitude\nof the increase observed in plasma PP levels with acute\nexercise seems to decrease with training(76). However,\nmost of these studies have looked only at the impact\nof exercise on the fasting levels of these gut peptides.\nCholecystokinin, GLP-1 and PP are satiety hormones\nreleased in the postprandial state, and therefore changes\nin fasting levels provide very little information. More-\nover, appetite measurement was not the primary out-\ncome in any of these studies. To the authors\u2019 knowledge,\nthere are no published studies that relate changes in\nthe plasma levels of these appetite-related hormones in\nresponse to both acute and chronic exercise to alterations\nin subjective and objective measures of appetite and\nnet EB.\nTo try to address some of these questions, a study has\nbeen designed to investigate the effects of an acute bout\nof moderate-intensity exercise when performed in the fed\nstate on the plasma levels of appetite-related hormones\nand metabolites, and to correlate potential alterations with\nchanges in subjective feelings of hunger and fullness and\nprospective food intake at a subsequent meal. Ghrelin,\nPYY, GLP-1 and PP were measured both in the fasted state\nand postprandially in healthy unrestrained normal-weight\nvolunteers using a randomized cross-over design. At 1 h\nafter a standardized breakfast subjects either cycled for\n60 min at 65% of their maximal heart rate or rested. Sub-\njective appetite was assessed throughout the study period\nusing visual analogue scales, and subsequent EI at a buffet\nmeal was measured at the end of the meal (3 h post-\nbreakfast, 1 h post-exercise)(77).\nA significant increase in buffet EI was observed with\nexercise. However, once the energy expended during\nexercise had been accounted for, a reduction in relative EI\nwas observed with exercise, with the attainment of a short-\nterm negative EB. This outcome was associated with the\nabsence of any significant difference in hunger sensations\nor in circulating appetite-related hormones between the\nexercised leg and the control leg immediately before\nthe buffet meal(77). Moreover, a transitory increase in the\nplasma levels of satiety hormones was observed during\nexercise in the absence of an increase in the orexigenic\npeptide ghrelin, suggesting that acute exercise does not\ntrigger any compensatory responses at the level of gastro-\nintestinal hormones involved in appetite regulation that\nwould lead to an increase in hunger and\/or EI in the short\nterm(77). On the contrary, the transitory increase in circu-\nlating satiety hormones that occurred during exercise could\nbe responsible for the well-documented phenomenon of\nTable 1.

Martins et al.\nexercise-induced anorexia, which has been described pre-\nviously(31,36). It is possible that the increase in absolute EI\nobserved in response to acute exercise is the result of\ncognitive factors, including attitudes and beliefs associated\nwith exercise such as \u2018food rewards for exercising\u2019 and the\nbelief that \u2018exercise increases hunger\u2019(50).\nDietary restraint\nDietary restraint refers to the extent to which individuals\nare concerned with their body weight and attempt to con-\ntrol it by dieting(78). It is characterized by a self-imposed\nresistance to the internal and external cues that regulate\neating behaviour, motivated by the desire to maintain or\nsuppress body weight(78). Dietary restraint has been asso-\nciated with an abnormal eating behaviour in response to\npreloading. While unrestrained individuals eat less after a\npreload, restrained individuals tend to eat more; two\nopposite behaviours that have become known as \u2018regu-\nlatory\u2019 and \u2018counter-regulatory eating\u2019 respectively(78\u201383).\nIt has become a common practice to exclude restrained\neaters from appetite studies(31\u201333,84,85), based on the\nassumption that they exhibit an atypical eating behaviour\nin response to preloading. Moreover, it has also been\nsuggested that the level of restraint can modulate the\neffects of exercise on EB(53). Acute exercise has previously\nbeen shown to be more effective in creating a negative\nEB in restrained eaters compared with unrestrained eaters;\nwhile unrestrained eaters increase their EI after exercise,\nrestrained eaters tend to decrease their EI(86). However, the\ninteraction between restraint and exercise in determining\nEI in the post-exercise period remains controversial(30,33)\nand is probably dependent on disinhibition (loss of\nrestraint) levels.\nThe exclusion of restrained eaters from appetite studies,\nhowever, has been carried out somewhat arbitrarily and no\nconsensus seems to exist either on the questionnaire or on\nthe cut-off points used for exclusion. Rather surprisingly,\ncloser analysis of the literature reveals that only a few\nstudies have been able to show a true \u2018counter-regulatory\neating behaviour\u2019 (with a significant preload \u00b7 restraint\ninteraction) in response to preloading in restrained\neaters(78,80\u201383), with such behaviour not being observed in\nthe majority of studies(87\u201393) (Table 2). Interestingly, in all\nthese studies a single highly-palatable and \u2018diet-breaking\u2019\nfood (ice cream) was used as the test meal and restraint\nwas always measured by the restrained revised scale\n(RRS)(94). It seems, therefore, that the response to pre-\nloading, in terms of eating behaviour, is dependent on both\nthe questionnaire used to measure restraint and the type of\ntest meal presented.\nThe dependence on the use of the RRS to demonstrate\ncounter-regulatory eating behaviour is not unexpected,\nsince the RRS tends to identify individuals susceptible\nto disinhibition, and therefore \u2018unsuccessful dieters\u2019,\nwhile the restraint subscales of the three-factor eating\nquestionnaire (TFEQ)(95) and the Dutch eating-behaviour\nquestionnaire (DEBQ)(96) tend to identify individuals less\nsusceptible to disinhibition, and therefore \u2018successful diet-\ners\u2019(97). It has been reported previously that only those\nsubjects who simultaneously present with high levels of\nboth restraint and disinhibition show a counter-regulatory\neating behaviour in response to preloading(98). Dietary re-\nstraint has been shown not to be a homogeneous construct\nand two dimensions have been identified: \u2018rigid control of\neating\u2019 and \u2018flexible control of eating\u2019(99). Those exhibiting\na \u2018pure\u2019 rigid control are more likely to show counter-\nregulatory eating behaviour, since they tend to set their\ncognitive diet boundary as a rigid point, which if passed\nmeans that further attempts to diet are hopeless, with con-\nsequent disinhibition and overeating.\nSeveral studies have tried to identify the best ques-\ntionnaire to predict disinhibition in the laboratory(100\u2013104),\nbut the results have been inconclusive. However, they have\nall used the taste-test paradigm that involves tasting and\nrating a single highly-palatable food (usually seen as \u2018diet\nbreaking\u2019), e.g. ice-cream, cookies or crackers, none of\nwhich illustrates a \u2018typical\u2019 meal. The question remains,\ntherefore, as to whether restrained eaters need to be ex-\ncluded from appetite-related studies and, if so, which ques-\ntionnaire and cut-off point should be used.\nThe predictive validity of three scales that assess dietary\nrestraint (the RRS, a shortened version of the TFEQ\n(eighteen-item revised(105) and the DEBQ) have been\ninvestigated for their ability to predict disinhibited eating\nbehaviour in normal-weight women in the laboratory (C\nMartins, E Tolhurst and LM Morgan, unpublished results).\nUsing a cross-over design fifteen participants were\nrandomly assigned to an HEP and an LEP, each clearly\nlabelled with the exact energy content, and EI was\nmeasured 1 h later at an ad libitum buffet lunch comprising\na variety of foods that included healthy (sandwiches, salad,\nyoghurt, fruit) and unhealthy options (cakes, biscuits, crisp,\nsauces). It was found that restrained women fail to show\na counter-regulatory eating behaviour, independently of\nthe questionnaire used to measure restraint (classification\nbased on a median split). Indeed, both restrained and\nunrestrained individuals were found to show a regulatory\neating behaviour, eating more after the LEP compared with\nafter the HEP (P<0.01), independently of the questionnaire\nused to measure restraint. Moreover, no significant differ-\nences in energy compensation (calculated as the difference\nin EI at the buffet lunches between the two study days\n(LEP\u2013HEP) divided by the difference in preload energy\n(1506 kJ) and expressed as a percentage) were found be-\ntween restrained and unrestrained women. Interestingly, a\nsignificant negative correlation (r- 0.653, n 15, P<0.01)\nwas observed between energy compensation and restraint\nwhen using the RRS, but not the other scales (C Martins, E\nTolhurst and LM Morgan, unpublished results). It seems,\ntherefore, that despite the inability of the RRS to predict\ndisinhibition in this study, the loss of compensation ob-\nserved with increasing levels of restraint was best fore-\ncasted by this scale.\nSimilar results were observed in another study with a\nmixed sample of normal-weight volunteers (twenty-one\nwomen and twelve men). Dietary restraint was measured\nby the DEBQ and TFEQ (eighteen-item revised version)\nand for women restrained eaters were defined as scoring\n\u202118 on the restraint subscale of the TFEQ (eighteen-item\nrevised version) and\/or \u20213.7 on the restraint subscale of\nPostgraduate Symposium 33\nTable 2.

Participants were\nrandomly assigned to one of two preloads with a similar\nenergy density but double the volume (250 ml and 2092 kJ\nor 500 ml and 4184 kJ hot chocolate drink) and EI was\nmeasured 3 h later at a pasta meal (tomato-based pasta\nmeal with cheese), simulating a second meal effect\n(C Martins, MD Robertson and LM Morgan, unpublished\nresults). Restrained eaters were not found to counter-\nregulate in response to preloading; in fact, both groups\nwere observed to compensate.\nIt can be hypothesized, therefore, that in the absence of\n\u2018diet-breaking\u2019 food counter-regulation is not expected to\noccur, independently of the questionnaire used to measure\nrestraint. The results of these two studies suggest a minor\nrole for restraint in predicting disinhibition when a more\n\u2018natural\u2019 setting is created. The question as to whether to\ninclude or exclude restrained eaters from appetite studies,\nbased on their atypical eating behaviour, deserves further\ninvestigation and none of the studies reported here can\nbe used to address this issue. Although the present findings\nmay support the inclusion of restrained eaters in appetite\nstudies when \u2018diet-breaking\u2019 foods are not involved, as\nno counter-regulatory behaviour has been found in these\ncircumstances, restrained eaters may compensate differ-\nently, even if they do not counter-regulate. Even though no\nsignificant differences were observed between restrained\nand unrestrained eaters in short-term energy compensation\nin the studies previously described (unrestrained eaters\nwere found to compensate slightly better than unrestrained\neaters in the first study, but the opposite was found in the\nsecond study) none of these studies was designed to look at\nsuch differences. More research is therefore needed in this\narea, and also on the impact of restraint on EI in response\nto exercise, for any firm conclusions to be reached.\nThe studies described here and other investigations(106,107)\nsuggest that restraint is a spectrum and not a dichotomic\nvariable; restrained eaters do not necessarily show a dia-\nmetrically-opposite behaviour to unrestrained, but they may\nshow a slightly or significantly different behaviour depend-\ning on the characteristics of the sample (levels of restraint\nand disinhibition) and the study design (type of preload and\ntest meal and questionnaire used to measure restraint).\nUnrestrained eaters may be seen as \u2018less-restrained eaters\u2019\nwho present a higher threshold for counter-regulation com-\npared with their restrained counterparts(106,108). Moreover,\ncounter-regulatory eating behaviour in response to preload-\ning has been shown to be equally as dependent on dis-\ninhibition as on restraint levels(98), suggesting that only those\nscoring high on both restraint and disinhibition should be\nexcluded from appetite studies.\nDietary restraint and abnormal physiology: is there\na link?\nAs previously discussed, restrained individuals may under\ncertain circumstances present an atypical eating behaviour\nin response to preloading in the laboratory environment.\nMoreover, in a free-living environment restrained eaters\nhave been shown to consume less energy(109) (although\nthat may be the result of underreporting(110)), take fewer\nmeals and exhibit a higher preference for low-energy and\nhealthy food(109), including fruits and vegetables(111),\ncompared with unrestrained eaters. Interestingly, a link has\nbeen suggested between restrained eating behaviour and\naltered physiological pathways; restrained eating has been\nshown to impact on metabolic(83,109) as well as endo-\ncrine(112\u2013114) functions.\nA lower total EE has been described in restrained\neaters(115), but it does not seem to be driven by a lower\nBMR(116). Dietary restraint seems also to play a role in\nthe magnitude of cephalic-phase reflexes, with restrained\nwomen showing larger cephalic-phase insulin(117) and\nsalivary(118) responses compared with unrestrained women.\nAnother study, however, has shown no significant differ-\nences in insulin, glucagon or PP cephalic-phase responses\nto the sham-feeding of a high-fat or low-fat cake between\nrestrained and unrestrained individuals(119).\nIncreased levels of fasting TAG(109) and NEFA(83) and\nlower fasting insulin(112,113) and leptin levels, even after\ncontrolling for fat mass(120\u2013122), have also been reported\nin restrained eaters. Moreover, higher levels of cortisol,\nindicative of increased psychological stress, probably in\nassociation with \u2018eating behaviour\u2019, has also been found\nin some(123,124) but not all studies(111). The metabolic\nresponse to a meal seems also to be affected by the level of\nrestraint. Restrained women have been shown to have a\nreduced diet-induced thermogenesis(125) and an increased\ncarbohydrate oxidation after a mixed meal(112), as well as\na reduced secretion of noradrenaline following a test\nmeal(113). It has been proposed that this change in fuel\noxidation may be related to an increased insulin sensitivity\nin restrained individuals(112). Another study, however, has\nfound that high disinhibition rather than high restraint is\nassociated with a lower thermic effect of food(116). Finally,\nrestraint also seems to impact on the postprandial release\nof gastrointestinal hormones involved in the control of\nappetite and food intake, with a blunted cholecystokinin\nrelease in response to a meal containing 40% total energy\nfrom fat, reported in restrained eaters(114).\nThese altered patterns of reduced leptin levels, reduced\ntotal EE, reduced ability to oxidize fat and reduced levels\nand\/or a blunted release of satiety hormones may put\nrestrained individuals at an increased risk for weight gain\nand could explain why they need to cognitively restrict\ntheir food intake in order to maintain their body weight.\nHowever, it is also possible that this metabolic pattern is a\nconsequence of the acute energy restriction characteristic\nof restrained eaters(126). More research is needed in this\narea to establish more clearly whether the metabolic and\nendocrine abnormalities reported by some studies in\nrestrained eaters are a cause or a consequence of their\natypical eating behaviour.\nAlthough restrained eating has been shown to be\nstrongly associated with measures of adiposity in normal-\nweight subjects but not obese subjects(111,127,128), the\neffect of dietary restraint on body weight in the long-\nterm remains controversial. Some studies show a positive\n36 C. Martins et al.\nassociation between dietary restraint at baseline and weight\ngain 1 year later in women but not in men(129), while other\nstudies show that restraint does not promote weight gain\nover a 2-year period(127). The complexity of the association\nbetween restraint and adiposity may be explained, at least\nin part, by the fact that restraint is not a homogenous\nconstruct, as previously discussed. It has been shown that\nwhile the rigid construct of restraint is positively asso-\nciated with BMI, the flexible construct of restraint is\nnegatively associated with BMI(128). Interestingly, higher\nvalues for adiposity at baseline have been shown to predict\na bigger increase in cognitive restraint 2 years later,\nsuggesting that restraint may be an adaptive mechanism to\ntry to limit weight gain(127).\nSimilar findings to those described by Burton-\nFreeman(114) have been observed in relation to PYY, with\nmoderately-restrained individuals presenting lower fasting\nlevels of PYY, at the limit of significance (P = 0.05),\ncompared with unrestrained eaters (using the middle point\nof the DEBQ (2.5) as the cut-off point) and a trend towards\nlower levels of PYY in the postprandial state (P = 0.07;\nC Martins, LM Morgan and MD Robertson, unpublished\nresults). However, this study was not designed to look at\nthe effect of restraint on PYY plasma levels(77), and\nhighly-restrained subjects (>3.5 in the restraint subscale of\nthe DEBQ) were excluded from the study, resulting in a\nvery narrow range of restraint. PYY plasma levels have\nbeen shown to be sensitive to acute and chronic food\nrestriction(130), to be modulated by gender (with higher\nlevels in females)(131) and also may possibly be modulated\nby body weight(131) (with lower fasting and postprandial\nlevels in obese subjects(132,133)). These confounding factors\nare, however, unlikely to explain the differences in PYY\nbetween restrained and unrestrained eaters observed in the\nauthors\u2019 study, as males:females was similar for both\ngroups and no significant differences were found between\ngroups in body weight, energy or macronutrient intake in\nthe 24 h preceding the study.\nOne of the limitations of most of the previously des-\ncribed studies that have shown an association between\nrestrained eating behaviour and altered physiology is that\nthey use a median split of the scale as the cut-off point to\nclassify restraint. If restrained eating behaviour is a con-\ntinuous rather a dichotomic variable(106,107), as previously\ndiscussed, this type of approach results in the arbitrary\ninclusion on either the restrained or unrestrained category\nof those scoring in the middle of the scale. A better\napproach would be to exclude those in the middle of the\nscale and select only those scoring very low or very high\nin restraint.\nIn order to overcome these limitations a study has been\nconducted to investigate the effects of dietary restraint\non fasting and postprandial levels of appetite-related\nmetabolites and hormones, subjective feelings of hunger\nand fullness and EI at a test-meal later in the day, in order\nto try to establish associations between potential alterations\nin the secretion of appetite-related hormones and meta-\nbolites and changes in subjective and objective measures\nof appetite in restrained eaters (C Martins, MD Robertson\nand LM Morgan, unpublished results). Normal-weight men\nand women were recruited and accepted for the study if\nthey scored either high or low in restraint (cut-off points\ndescribed earlier). Using a randomized cross-over design\nparticipants (twelve men and twenty-one women) were\nassigned to one of two breakfasts (preloads; a hot choco-\nlate drink) with a similar energy density but double the\nvolume (250 ml and 2092 kJ or 500 ml and 4184 kJ).\nPlasma levels of glucose, TAG, insulin and PYY and\nsubjective hunger and fullness were measured for a period\nof 3 h. Participants were then presented with a pasta-based\nmeal and EI was measured. No significant effect of re-\nstraint on the postprandial plasma levels of PYY or TAG\nwas found, but glucose and insulin were found to be sig-\nnificantly lower (P = 0.045 and P = 0.015 respectively)\nin restrained eaters compared with unrestrained eaters,\nindependently of the preload. Despite these findings,\nrestrained eaters reported significantly higher fullness\nratings (P = 0.033) throughout the study period compared\nwith unrestrained eaters regardless of the preload. How-\never, this increased fullness in restrained eaters was not\nfound to be reflected in the EI at the pasta meal, which was\nsimilar in both groups. Restrained eaters also presented\nwith reduced fasting insulin levels and increased fasting\ninsulin sensitivity (using the HOMA model), independently\nof the condition (P<0.05 for all), despite there being\nno significant differences in body weight or composition\nbetween the two groups (C Martins, MD Robertson, LM\nMorgan, unpublished results).\nLower fasting insulin levels have previously been\nreported in restrained women(112,113), as well as lower\ninsulin resistance (based on the HOMA model)(112). How-\never, body weight was found to be a confounder in the\nlatter study(112), which showed increased fasting insulin\nsensitivity in restrained eaters. The findings of the present\nauthors are in line with and reinforce those of the earlier\nstudies(112,113). The reason for the lower glucose and insu-\nlin plasma levels in the postprandial state observed in\nrestrained eaters in the present study is not known. How-\never, noradrenaline may be involved, as it plays a key role\nin energy metabolism, i.e. by increasing glycolysis(134)\nwith consequent release of glucose into the bloodstream.\nPlasma noradrenaline levels have been reported to be\nlower in restrained normal-weight women after a meal(113),\ntherefore offering a plausible explanation for the lower\npostprandial glucose plasma levels observed in restrained\neaters in the present study.\nIt was originally proposed that restrained eaters suffer\nfrom a weak sensitivity to physiological cues that regulate\nfood intake and an overreliance on cognitive cues(135),\nexperiencing hunger only when very deprived and reaching\nsatiety much later than unrestrained eaters(136). This model\nwas, however, soon challenged(137), when it was shown\nthat restrained eaters are not less sensitive to internal cues,\nbut do have an increased sensitivity to external cues. The\nincreased fullness in restrained eaters compared with\nunrestrained eaters after the same meal, previously des-\ncribed in the authors\u2019 study, suggests an increased sensi-\ntivity to both internal and external cues that regulate food\nintake in restrained eaters; the two preloads carried both a\ndifferent cognitive message (one or two mugs of hot cho-\ncolate) and generated a different physiological response\n(2092 and 4184 kJ).\nPostgraduate Symposium 37\nConclusions\nExercise has been shown to have beneficial effects on\nshort-term appetite control by enabling a more \u2018sensitive\u2019\neating behaviour in response to previous EI. Moreover,\nit does not appear to prompt any acute physiological\nadaptations that would lead to an increase in hunger and\/\nor EI in response to increased EE. The beneficial impact\nof exercise on the EB equation is therefore twofold, not\nonly increasing EE but also modulating EI. These findings\nprovide the foundation for future work in this area and\nhave important implications in terms of the steadily-\nincreasing prevalence of obesity in the UK and the current\nfailure to meet the Department of Health recommendations\nfor PA(15). Insufficient studies have been performed in this\narea to draw any firm conclusions about the optimal level\nof exercise needed to improve appetite control. Moderate\nPA for 30 min on most, preferably all, days of the week\nproposed by both the American College of Sports Medi-\ncine(13, 14) and the UK Department of Health(15) has been\nshown to be effective(65) and is therefore at present the\nbest recommendation for the general public in terms of\ngood health. Further studies are needed to elucidate the\nmechanisms whereby exercise improves short-term appe-\ntite control.\nRestrained eating behaviour does not seem to impact on\nPYY plasma levels, but is likely to be involved in glucose\nmetabolism. Despite being associated with increased\nfullness in the postprandial state, restraint seems to exert\na minor role in predicting disinhibition in the laboratory,\nat least when a less \u2018artificial\u2019 setting is created. More\nresearch is needed to clarify the role of restraint on glucose\nhomeostasis and the relevance of the metabolic and endo-\ncrine abnormalities reported in restrained individuals to the\naetiology of the current obesity pandemic.\nAcknowledgements\nC.
