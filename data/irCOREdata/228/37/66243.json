In order to explicate\nthe nature of accountability better this paper will, therefore, formulate and apply its\nown comparative framework to the case of the East Asian economic miracle, crisis and\nrecovery in particular. In so doing it finds that, even when accountability emerged as a\nmid-crisis issue that was dramatically reconfigured for any due recovery later, it was\nnot itself then sufficiently explicated for all the implications and consequences to be rea-\nlized fully.

By using its\nown comparative accountability framework it particularly seeks to explain how East\nAsia\u2019s dramatically reconfigured accountability, following that region\u2019s astounding\nrelative economic growth, uneven development and precipitate crisis before, had other\nimportant implications and further consequences for its recovery. So far these may not\nhave become suitably intelligible, precisely because few have sufficiently identified,\nquestioned and challenged the nature of accountability itself.\nAn uninformed pursuit of greater accountability may fail to grasp what else its further\nreconfiguration might effect. In any case, a number of different parties may well have their\nown specialist agendas for pursuing both further transparency and accountability in\neconomic governance.

So, too, have various other would-be\n\u2018best practice\u2019\/standard prescribing organizations (Graz 2003), key bond\/credit rating\nagencies such as Moody\u2019s and Standard and Poor\u2019s, and aspiring global accountancy\nand management consultancy firms (King & Sinclair 2003), together with various other\ncampaign movements. Although each of these may put its own particular construction\nupon it, accountability is nevertheless so much part of the very making of human\nsociety itself that they appear partially selective constructions at best. Any further\ndebate, therefore, should not be straight-jacketed along what would seem to be mutually\nexclusive, either\/or accountable or else unaccountable type lines when the real issue\nconcerns what particular forms accountability necessarily can and might take, and how\nthese are best chosen and effected.\nDevelopments across East Asia can here provide an illuminating test case of the remak-\ning of accountability in economic governance generally. The original grand narrative\nitself \u2013 albeit one which has been variously \u2018discursively deconstructed\u2019 since\n(Hall 2003) \u2013 typically depicted an East Asian economic miracle, crisis and recovery\nwhere the importance of accountability apparently only emerged mid-crisis, to be made\nincreasingly imperative for any due recovery. However, this was not simply an issue of\ncompelling previously relatively unaccountable regimes to finally become more economi-\ncally accountable, by means of due processes they had merely skirted before. It was also an\noccasion for others to exercise the power and authority to effect different accountability\npreferences upon societies which, in the accepted grand narrative of the time, had, until\nthen, successfully pursued different accountabilities. As a result, the social and political,\nas well as economic and administrative, efficacy of reconfiguring their entire accountabi-\nlity this way was highly loaded from the start. To understand this better it is first necessary\nto explicate more about the very nature of accountability itself, and then outline how it was\nso dramatically reconfigured over the entire East Asian economic miracle, crisis and\nrecovery.\nAccountability Explicated\nIf accountability can be considered indispensable for the making of human society itself\nthen it is clearly most important to differentiate further all the different individual forms\nit takes while also explaining how they might best fit certain types of society. So far,\nthe various distinct origins, characteristics and also limitations upon these different\naccountabilities have not been explicated readily. In addition, contemporary social\nscience (see, for instance, Munro & Mouritsen 1996) has argued that accountability can\nbe constructed socially and politically to the effect of asserting one type of society over\nanother, for which reason accountability is never far removed from power and authority.\nCertain recently proposed changes in economic governance incorporate preferences\nwhich, themselves, reflect quite different bearings upon what \u2018good governance\u2019 should\nbe. The real efficacy of different accountabilities for economic governance cannot,\ntherefore, be realized fully unless the nature of accountability itself becomes explicated\nbetter through being developed from a \u2018tool\u2019 to a \u2018theory\u2019 (Douglas and Ney 1998).\nAt present the study of accountability already cuts across a number of different academic\nsubject boundaries, while itself extending towards more academics (Strathern 2000),\n92 J. Ritchie\nincluding researchers (Romm 2002), themselves. Issues of accountability are, therefore,\nembraced within quite a number of different debates. It has often been linked closely\nwith the study of governance (Bovens 1998), even though this has not always been the\nmost stable articulating principle (Pierre 2000), despite prospectively encompassing\nboth its public and private orbits. Moving attention from governance towards particular\norganizations and their management shows that accountability has gone beyond the orig-\ninal envelope of \u2018public administration\u2019 into the \u2018new public management\u2019 (Guy & Dufour\n2000; Wolf 2000) and beyond. At the same time it has variously embraced the discourses\nof the new \u2018managerial\u2019 (Clarke & Newman 1997), \u2018regulatory\u2019 (Scott 2000), and \u2018self-\nrestraining\u2019 (Schedler et al. 1999) state. Where these become debated more critically,\naccountability has accordingly been implicated further within such rising syndromes as\n\u2018governing by numbers\u2019 (Miller 2001), while \u2018drowning by numbers\u2019 (Fisher 2000),\ndepending upon whatever \u2018regime of control\u2019 the prevailing \u2018audit society\u2019 (Power\n1997) would choose to impose. Similarly, while orthodox management theory has its\nown distinct history, its early pathfinders put accountability and responsibility so\nmuch at issue right from the start that both have since been radically rethought as a\nresult (Koestenbaum & Block 2001), as other campaign movements, such as \u2018Social\nAccountability\u2019 would also call for.\nAll these different accountabilities clearly need to be specified suitably, framed and\nrendered comparable with each other (Day & Klein 1987) before they, themselves,\nbecome sufficiently explicable for our purposes here. By drawing upon other parallel\nfour-fold explanatory schemas, such as those derived from Douglas (1982) and\nFiske (1991), for example, it is possible to derive the core ideal-typical nature of these\naccountabilities from a matrix of both vertical (i.e. rule) and horizontal (i.e. relational)\ncharacteristics, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nBy thus differentiating their vertical from their horizontal, and also stronger- and\nweaker-held characteristics, Types 1 and 2 are revealed to be the more formally extant\nand Types 3 and 4 the more personal and socially diffuse forms of accountability,\nrespectively. As the most taken-for-granted, and also voluntaristic, form of accountability,\nType 3 has long underscored much personally close, family, kin, friendship and related\nFigure 1. Ideal-typical forms of accountability. Source: Ritchie and Richardson (2000: 454).\nAccountability in East Asia 93\npeer group interaction, without necessarily attracting very much notice itself. When it does\nattract more attention as a form of accountability, for example through being either verti-\ncally (by adding more rules) or horizontally (by incorporating other groups\/outgroups)\nrealigned, this type becomes less voluntarily acceptable through either compromising\nthe required personal closeness through impersonal rule-making, or else becoming\nincreasingly sociocentric accountability instead. Any honour and shame attached is then\nmade public should this convert over into Type 4 accountability, where honour signifies\ndue affirmation, dishonour integrity lost (Stewart 1994) and shame stigmatic exposure\non an increasing scale (Scheff 2000). In particular, these appear in the practice of \u2018account-\ning at the margins\u2019 (Miller 1998; Ritchie & Richardson 2000), which can invoke both\nhonour and shame when, for instance, it becomes questionable whether promised trans-\nactions between different parties can be \u2018honoured\u2019, knowing full well what particular\nstigma either insolvency, bankruptcy and other deliberate \u2018shaming of corporations\u2019-\ntype tactics (Skeel 2001) might otherwise invoke. However, while most pursue Type 4\nthrough diffuse social networks, formally extant Type 1 accountability is exacted\nthrough rule-making hierarchies, which, themselves, bring other organizational consider-\nations to bear (Jaques 1976; Du Gay 2000), including dutiful indifference towards\nwhatever falls outside their formal jurisdiction (Herzfeld 1992). If more relational ground-\ning is required, Type 1 may then give way to Type 2 accountability wherever it appears\nbetter \u2018fitted\u2019 for more specific purposes, provided that neither undue rule dominance\nand\/or relational incongruence then come to dominate instead.\nAt the same time, few accountabilities occur alone, while most continue to move in\nand out of \u2018fit\u2019 with their surroundings. Most, indeed, overlap and recombine together\ninto dominant overall configurations that can vary according to different societal prefer-\nences precisely because few accountabilities enjoy unqualified universal appeal whatever\nthe society concerned. The question, therefore, arises: just how societally specific, malle-\nable and\/or transferable are certain leading configurations likely to be, given their\nsupposed importance for \u2018good governance\u2019 proper? If the societies concerned already\nconsider themselves reasonably alike, then interchangeable accountabilities would seem\nless problematic, although not even the original \u2018convergence thesis\u2019 (Kerr 1983) antici-\npated complete convergence, as recent restatements (Pollitt 2001a; 2001b) emphasize.\nIn addition, \u2018divergent capitalisms\u2019 (Whitley 1999) \u2013 including both Eastern and\nWestern European, as well as US and East Asian variations \u2013 themselves question\nwho leads and follows any one selected accountability ethos. In due course, a comparative\n\u2018business systems\u2019 approach, more adapted towards \u2018developing societies\u2019 (Jacobsen &\nTorp 2001), could well explore the issues of convergent and divergent accountabilities\nfurther. Any growing cross-overs between transnational business and international\nproduction\/commodity chains (Gereffi & Korzeniewicz 1994), together with supraterri-\ntorial diasporas and \u2018transnational classes\u2019, will further complicate such matters. The\nmultiple different accountabilities that \u2018recombinant property\u2019 displayed within so-called\ntransitional economies have likewise brought intermediate configurations to light as well\n(Stark 1996; 2001). On further examination of East Asian development, it was evident that\nthe remaking of accountability itself was likewise dependent upon whether either an\neconomic miracle, crisis or recovery was dominant at the time.\nReprising East Asia\u2019s Developmental Breakthrough\nRecent developments across East Asia have been considered to be a successive miracle,\ncrisis and recovery, whereby the flaws in its original economic breakthrough were\nbrought to account before better governance was sought to ensure stable progress\n94 J. Ritchie\nahead. At the same time such reconfigured accountability latterly served certain political\nand economic purposes more than others, whereas accountability had not really been part\nof the lexicon of any original economic miracle before. The popular idea of an economic\nmiracle, indeed, implied that this was something extraordinary beyond expectation, which,\njust by virtue of being a miracle, lay beyond previously available explanation as well\n(Ritchie 1994). Once this particular economic miracle went into crisis, however, account-\nability became increasingly important and imperative for due recovery later.\nThus, that miracle, crisis and recovery are better reprised together, in their entirety,\nrather than as individually separate phases apart, granted that even the earlier (South\nEast) \u2018Asian Drama\u2019 (Myrdal 1965) had already illustrated how drama-laden this\nregion\u2019s entire economic performance could prove. Indeed, previously there had been\ndifferent economic miracle claims about Mainland China (Ritchie 1997), while economic\ncrises were still conventionally considered to be mere one-off aberrations from \u2018normal\u2019\nmarket equilibrium elsewhere (Perelman 1999). It is, nevertheless, useful to consider\nthe character of economic miracle claims before reprising these dramatic East Asian\ndevelopments further. As well as overturning previously accepted wisdom, these\nmiracle claims challenged alternative explanations about economic performance, particu-\nlarly through their \u2018high conviction\u2019 as opposed to \u2018high reliability\u2019 based form of argu-\nmentation, which can be difficult to engage on anything other than its own set terms\n(Ritchie 1999). Only if one deciphers how miracle claims become constituted thus, as\nwell as what it is that they actually claim, are they likely to be suitably engaged and,\nthen, challenged critically. In principle, any economic miracle should occur on an excep-\ntionally dramatic public scale, itself obtained through unique organizational processes that\nmight not have been anticipated before. To be more specific, it should first publicly drama-\ntize an increasingly economically active society, whose forward momentum thereafter\nrequires decidedly pro-economic governance, to bring about near-simultaneous transform-\nation\/dissolution of a new and old order, as championed by those movements which make\nthis their chosen cause. These are, nevertheless, the outcomes of unique organizational\nprocesses which bind developing enterprise cultures with rising organizational births\/\nrebirths, fronted by emerging entrepreneurial classes and popularly recognized miracle\nworkings\/workers themselves. Only when these particular processes are then linked\ninto such dramatic outcomes will most economic miracle claims become sufficiently\nconvincing for the necessary sense of transformation to take hold. If such claims only\nconvince in terms of outcomes alone they will lack suitable organizational grounding;\nif only organizationally grounded they will lack sufficiently dramatic scale and scope\ninstead. In either case, the resulting gaps and inconsistencies expose such claims to the\nkind of doubt and incomprehension that undermines the very faith that otherwise sustains\nmiraculous belief in them.\nIn effect, the grand narrative of an East Asian economic miracle purported to rewrite\nan entire paradigm of economic history in its own right (Jones 1981; Frank 1998). It\nasserted that, as well as regaining their historic ascendancy, East Asia\u2019s increasingly econ-\nomically active societies would outperform most others while also raising millions from\nactual\/near poverty at the same time. Other best-of-all-worlds-type scenarios also\nimplied that East Asian cultural equilibrium would not be disturbed by this process\nbecause \u2018Asian values\u2019 would prove integral to, and not just dispensations of, the material\ntransformations already under way. For that reason East Asian societies would modernize\nthemselves more organically and with less detrimental costs than their Western counter-\nparts had managed before (Beng-Huat 1999; Thompson 2001), so that any economic\nmiracle could be accomplished quicker, better and with more cultural congruency by\ncomparison. Of all the different versions that this \u2018success story\u2019 went through, perhaps\nAccountability in East Asia 95\nthe World Bank (1993) study conferred most official recognition upon this \u2018East Asian\nDevelopment Model\u2019 as the key economic miracle of its time. This study claimed that,\nfor example, by \u2018getting the fundamentals right\u2019, while still achieving exceptional\n\u2018growth with equity\u2019, this model was very well balanced, with no particular crisis then\nin sight. The dramatic scale of the transformations then claimed still overshadowed\ndetailed understanding about leading East Asian organizational processes, however.\nHowever, while some observers simply debated whether these transformations were\neither primarily state or market led, others who had earlier identified \u2018ersatz\u2019 and\n\u2018crony\u2019 capitalist syndromes (Yoshihara 1988; Clad, 1989; Daly and Logan 1989;\nBackman, 1999) would ironically find these syndromes became leading public culprits\nfor the crisis itself.\nRealizing Accountability Under Crisis\nBecause the very idea of crisis has itself been somewhat ambiguously conceived and used\nrather loosely before (Holton 1987), it is necessary to keep its application here under\ncritical scrutiny. In actuality, a different sense of crisis had already underscored wider\nAsian economic performance before (Myrdal 1965), which could well have led some to\nconsider its later breakthrough relatively miraculous as a result. Although the idea of\nthis subsequent \u2018Asian crisis\u2019 soon slipped into everyday usage, and supplementary\ndescriptors like Asian \u2018flu\u2019, \u2018sickness\u2019 and \u2018migraine\u2019 all popularly signified what type\nof outgroup these economies had then become, it was not always sufficiently interrogated\nat the time, so that related understandings were invariably skewed (Ritchie 2001). To be\nsure it was quickly, if somewhat uncritically, designated to be an economic, if not outright\nfinancial, crisis from the start, but only with the consequence that certain social and poli-\ntical characteristics were segregated out, as if they were just incidental accompaniments\nof any \u2018real\u2019 crisis itself. As a result, more attention was directed arguably towards the\ncapitalistic framing of East Asian economic activities rather than what those activities\nthemselves actually were (Hamilton 1999).\nAs East Asian economies then became popularly ring-fenced, some began dissembling\ntheir former pro-miracle arguments and not even the encouragement to re-designate it\nan economic downturn, growth interruption, transitional readjustment, or disequilibrium\ncorrective could obscure the oscillations that took place. Indeed, the IMF at first found\nit difficult to acknowledge this to be a crisis, fearing that such express acknowledgement\nwould, itself, invite further shockwaves, as did others, such as the EU (Bridges 1999;\nLee 2000). At the time, both the IMF and the World Bank already publicly subscribed\nto particular accountability preferences, to which certain critics believed they themselves\ndid not necessarily adhere to (Harper 1998; 2000; Fox & Brown 1998). Close\nfirst-hand observation of the IMF at the time suggested it became seized with its own\ninternal \u2018organizational shock\u2019 as events were then unfolding (Burstein 2001). To the\nextent that certain key East Asian states considered that the IMF\u2019s possible misreading\nof their situation actually compounded their own rising problems, this also became\nknown as the \u2018IMF crisis\u2019.\nWhen the more accepted explanation of an \u2018Asian crisis\u2019 did take hold, it was first\nconsidered a one-off occurrence apart with its own distinct historical niche and clear\nbeginning and end to the course it would follow. A number of neat matter-of-fact chrono-\nlogies of key events at the time later implied that it was possible to be unequivocal about\nwhere, when and how any such crisis first began, and what immediately followed, even if\nits actual ending could not be determined. It became the accepted wisdom that, having\nbegun within Thailand in 1997, the crisis then seized other so-called \u2018Tiger Cub\u2019 and, in\n96 J. Ritchie\nthe case of South Korea, \u2018Tiger\u2019 economies as well, with \u2018Asian contagion\u2019 confusing\nmatters further. Subsequent explanations for what then happened partly rested upon\nwhat authorial perspective they employed, granted that convention already held that\ncreditors would be the first to author the debtors\u2019 story. If some states and institutions\noutside East Asia, indeed, considered they were obliged to \u2018bail in\u2019 to its required\n\u2018rescue\u2019, the case of Malaysia at least challenged accepted wisdom. Instead, its \u2018economic\nnationalist\u2019-type challenge over the astounding currency fluctuations, capital flight,\nportfolio investment withdrawals, and bank runs, defaults, and credit crunches of the\nimmediate time held outsiders most responsible \u2013 \u2018international financial speculators\u2019\nincluded. In cases where it was considered to be more than just a financial (currency\nand\/or liquidity based) crisis, the morality of wider world economic power and authority\nwas questioned and different accountability was then called for. Given all the different\ninstitutional forces at work (Henderson 1999), certain accepted explanations for \u2013 and\nalso detailed chronologies of \u2013 this crisis later appear just too simple, particularly\nwhen Mainland China\u2019s pre-1997 economic realignments (Fernald et al. 1999), the\nearlier Japanese \u2018bubble\u2019 and the 1980\u2019s neo-liberal \u2018big bang\u2019 financial deregulation\nwere also taken into consideration.\nTowards Accountable Recovery\nA crisis that arose from not comprehending fully the economic breakthrough, thus,\ncompelled more accountable recovery as a result. Even related statistical time series\ndata were then produced as if economic performance could be sharply divided between\nbreakthrough and crisis periods, respectively. However, while this reflected the prevailing\ntendency to isolate and ring-fence any crisis and, thereby, regard it as a one-off occurrence,\nfurther debate became bound up increasingly with recovery. At the same time, account-\nability was being reconfigured along such different lines that this also requires further\nexplanation.\nTo appreciate the particular reconfiguration decided upon, and explain how that choice\nwas made, the different prospective accountabilities can be considered from four specific\nsubtexts concerning recovery, hereafter termed the (free) market equilibrium, policy\nmanagement, institutional learning, and redress strategies, respectively. Despite their\nsimplicity, these strategies can still yield further insights into the choices made and\nwhat they each inscribed upon recovery. For these purposes each individual strategy\ncan be considered to occupy a different position on one single continuum representing\nhow the case for any specific kind of accountability might have been argued for\nhypothetically. At one end of that continuum the case to be argued would have been\nfrontloaded (that is, those particular factors would count most, compared with all the\nothers which might have been considered) in expressly economic and financial terms,\nwith social and political factors at the other end. The market equilibrium argument\nwas, therefore, frontloaded most economically and financially, whereas, at the other\nend, the redress strategy was the most social and political, with policy management\nand institutional learning occupying intermediate positions between them both. By\ngrasping this, it is possible to understand and explain the actual preference for market\nequilibrium with reference to the reasoning behind it, especially compared with what\nthese other strategies prescribed instead.\nRecovery through market equilibrium implied reframing East Asia\u2019s entire economic\nand financial readjustment to wider market forces, whereas the desiderata of policy\nmanagement exceeded market-based parameters. Because institutional learning\nplaced less significance on economic and financial factors, in principle it also embraced\nAccountability in East Asia 97\nother state-, business-, production-, consumption-related considerations, while redress\nsought renewed East Asian leadership above all. Given that market equilibrium was\nmost officially preferred, further policy management also called for wider macro-regional\neconomic and financial reform (Petri 2001). Institutional learning additionally looked\ntowards, for example, IMF, World Bank, APEC, ASEAN (Drysdale 2000) and corporate\ngovernance reforms (Legewie & Meyer-Ohle, 2000; Kotler & Kartajaya 2000), while\nredress insisted upon an \u2018Asian recovery\u2019. As a result, market equilibrium proposed\nchanging accountability for economic and financial reasons, thereby sidelining alternative\nconcerns about more accountable civil society, justice, democracy, media freedom and the\nright to organize, for example. It sought to loosen markets from close East Asian ties and\nobligations and would also oblige states and governments to reduce their \u2018market\ndistorting\u2019 involvements, especially those that made required economic and financial\ninformation less transparent, the flow of which was already constrained through\ninadequate accountancy, itself (Rahman 1998). The 2001 Economist \u2018Survey of Asian\nBusiness\u2019 at the time expressed this in terms of being \u2018in praise of rules\u2019, where too\nmany states and governments had been like \u2018empires without umpires\u2019 before, although\nthose with particular ASEAN and APEC affiliations already found increasing transparency\nitself difficult (Ravenhill 2001). In effect, certain East Asian networks would, thus,\nbecome increasingly disembedded from those close mutual relationships which might\ninhibit freer markets from achieving equilibrium conditions, even where, ironically,\nthese relationships might have been held co-responsible for the miracle breakthrough\nbefore. The near-simultaneous disclosure of still other economic crises emerging within\nEastern Europe and elsewhere nevertheless raised other policy management-type\nissues, while the institutional learning strategy emphasized other social and political\ndimensions as well. In drawing attention to how well institutions like the IMF were\norganized and managed for the task, and what else they needed to learn from these critical\nepisodes, the institutional learning strategy foreshadowed growing criticism within East\nAsia, to which the redress strategy gave active voice. While institutional learning was a\ndual purpose strategy that would both enable East Asian recovery while also pursuing\noutside reforms, redress implied being much more partisan regarding the alleged\nintrusion, corrosive regimes, aggressive social class struggles, worker-community\nrepression and similar \u2018off balance sheet\u2019 syndromes also considered to precipitate this\ncrisis and other uneven development before (Burkett & Hart-Landsberg 2000). The\nredress strategy further doubted whether more transparent economic and financial\naccountability could alone effect a truly \u2018Asian recovery\u2019 unless it also addressed these\nsocial and political issues first. It particularly feared that such accountability would\nmerely disclose more valuable competitive secrets to others outside, especially to those\nwho might then gain control over selected East Asian business assets at much depreciated\n\u2018knock down\u2019 or \u2018fire sale\u2019 rates. It, therefore, insisted that East Asian societies needed to\nrecover from more than short term, or even primarily economic and financial, crisis alone,\nfor which reason it would compel greater social and political accountability proper.\nThe particular implications and consequences of each of these different strategies can\nbe illustrated briefly with specific reference to South Korea. In this case, few immediately\nquestioned its newly conferred status as East Asia\u2019s star recovering economy when near\ndouble-digit annual GDP figures were first made public. Although its impending default\nwas equally dramatic, others outside quickly assumed that IMF (and World Bank) \u2018super-\nvision\u2019 had enabled this remarkable turnaround despite considerable criticism within\nSouth Korea itself. As a one-time \u2018hermit nation\u2019 for whom traditionally \u2018transparency\nis hell\u2019 (Alford 1999), South Korea had first become \u2018Asia\u2019s Next Giant\u2019 (Amsden\n1989) with such limited outside cultural exposure that its accountability might always\n98 J. Ritchie\nhave been potentially problematic. To be held more accountable through the IMF in view\nof this crisis was itself deemed tantamount to a \u2018national shame and humiliation\u2019 for South\nKorean society which might even put its entire sovereignty at risk. Thus, in then mapping\nSouth Korean\u2019s recovery, the preferred market equilibrium strategy prescribed near-\n\u2018paradigmatic change\u2019 towards a new market-led order (Jwa 2001); policy management\nemphasized the importance of central tripartite state\/big business\/organized labour pacts,\nin addition to meeting IMF \u2018structural-readjustment\u2019 conditionality; institutional\nlearning argued further that customary South Korean \u2018deep finance\u2019 (Biggart 1998) and\nso-called \u2018mafioso state\u2019 manoeuvres (Oh 1999) could still privilege the leading chaebols\nunless they were held more accountable socially and politically; while the redress strategy\nheld that South Korea\u2019s forced transnationalization, diminished sovereignty, continuing\nsocial class conflicts and, sometimes, social and political repression, could still obstruct\ntrue recovery (Hart-Landsberg & Burkett 2000).\nDiscussion\nIf an increasing number of pronouncements by states, governments, multilateral\/inter-\nnational organizations, and also corporate\/special interest campaign groups are to be\nbelieved, accountability has lately been moved towards the centre of \u2018good governance\u2019\nproper. In some cases \u2013 the IMF and World Bank included \u2013 this has been partly in\nresponse to events like those just outlined. It is now necessary to reinterpret those same\nevents using the theoretical framework proposed for the specific purpose of explaining\nwhy, and with what effect, accountability then changed (Figure 1). Of course, if it is\nthe case that societies may converge together over certain matters while still diverging\nabout others, accountability gets caught up in the middle of a dilemma about its true affilia-\ntion, especially where its global standardization is proposed. The whole East Asian case\nwould suggest that few may yet fully grasp all accountability\u2019s diverse forms, implications\nand consequences, including the synergies, trade-offs and syndromes that occur when\ndifferent accountabilities must combine together. The case, indeed, suggests that no one\nspecific \u2018type\u2019 of accountability itself proved overwhelmingly problematic; the appropri-\nate configuration was more at the heart of many issues raised. This is not to be explained\nthrough broad-brush overarching categories such as East\u2013West differences alone (Beeson\n2001; Prakash 2001), especially if East Asian societies themselves converge regarding the\nidea of responsibility while diverging about accountability itself (Velayutham 1999) and\ntheir ruling regimes resist rival arguments like those which Krugman (1994) originally\nadvanced.\nAll this begs the question of why the crisis initially left East Asia\u2019s previous account-\nability so critically exposed, as if there had been untold \u2018black holes\u2019 in accounts of the\nmiracle before. The main lines of thought about economic crises might categorize\nbriefly these into the local\/transient, cyclic\/episodic, serial\/systemic, and fuzzy\/\nreverberative types, respectively. As defined here, a local\/transient crisis only occurs\nrelatively randomly in isolation, whereas a cyclic\/episodic type arises in sequence to\nthe extent that, should it ever escalate into the sort of serial\/systemic crisis that in\nMarxian terms is considered to be inherent within capitalism itself, it may threaten to\nbecome terminally unmanageable. By contrast, the fuzzy\/reverberative type arises\nmore randomly and is less well embedded, bearing less predictable outcomes as a\nresult. At first, the East Asian crisis appeared so local\/transient to isolated individual\neconomies, such as Thailand in 1997, that, for public purposes, it was accounted for\nvery straightforwardly, at least until \u2018Asian contagion\u2019 took hold. At that point, selected\ncyclic\/episodic characteristics were also observed, sometimes extending back into\nAccountability in East Asia 99\nChina\u2019s prior economic repositioning and also Japan\u2019s earlier economic \u2018bubble\u2019. At the\ntime when the crisis actually peaked, it was also feared that the region\u2019s startling exposure\nmight escalate into a serial\/systemic crisis outside. Given such different understandings\nabout the crisis itself it was not, then, surprising that it was also considered to be an emer-\ngently fuzzy\/reverberative crisis as well.\nThe effects of being chosen under ongoing crisis conditions also worked themselves\nthrough into the different accountability then sought. The resulting choice of accountabi-\nlity was, thus, inscribed with a selective diagnosis of East Asian accountability\u2019s previous\nfailings, as well as the changed accountability being sought. In terms of the comparative\nframework here, the most frontline crisis-afflicted states, such as Thailand, Indonesia and\nSouth Korea, for example, were together judged excessively beholden unto narrowly\nnative-bound Type 3 and, sometimes, also Type 4, relational accountability, so that\nthey could not meet so-called new \u2018international standards\u2019 that called for better vertical\naccountability in economic governance. On the basis of that diagnosis, the required recon-\nfiguration of East Asian accountability sought increasing lawful rule-based Type 1,\ntogether with appropriately standardized, Type 2 accountability. An example of the\nsupposed failings which its customary Type 3 accountability otherwise brought was the\nlimited control over key national family and dynastic e\u00b4lites beyond that exerted through\ntheir existing personal circle. A further example of Type 4 related failings was represented\nto be key East Asian networks\u2019 own supposedly semi-exclusive, \u2018anti-competitive\u2019\nclosed\/close ownership ties, mutual alliances and self-protective arrangements which\nenhanced other \u2018state and market failure\u2019 to change before crisis struck.\nTo grasp what such increasing Type 1 accountability implied, it is useful to consider\nEast Asia\u2019s further legalization proper, since lawfully coded rules would henceforward\nbecome increasingly important, and certain frontline crisis-afflicted states\u2019 subsequent\nglobalization strategy virtually compelled it (Harding 2002). Outside those frontline\nstates, both Japanese and Chinese legal systems still differed (Mattei 1997), while\nOffshore Chinese family business networks right across the region had customarily pre-\nferred Type 3 accountability (Winn 1994). With its much cited \u2018shame culture\u2019, Japan\nhad seen more Type 4 \u2018name and shame\u2019 accountability exacted over its aberrant bank\nand finance officials following the \u2018bubble\u2019 before. But any pressures brought to bear\nupon Japan to become more fully Type 1\/2 accountable for wider regional recovery\ncould have less future significance than those concerning China. Although not a frontline\ncrisis-afflicted state itself, China\u2019s position has appeared blurred through limited transpar-\nency and accountability. Its continuing realignment with the wider world economy\nand protracted WTO entry process, has brought more official pronouncements about\nboth, yet some observers remained sceptical (Vermeer & D\u2019Houghe 2001), even when\nthe SARS outbreak first occurred. In this and other matters it is necessary to recognize\nthat East Asian accountability is still in flux, however, despite it becoming increasingly\ncodified outside (Soederberg 2003). Such codes may require close empirical scrutiny\n(see, for example, Drabeck & Payne 2002; Rodan, 2002; Zhao et al. 2003) if the claims\nof both transparency and accountability to enable \u2018good governance\u2019 are to prove justified\nin future.\nConclusions\nThe study of economic governance today directs particular attention towards accountabi-\nlity itself. However, despite being deemed increasingly imperative for \u2018good governance\u2019\nproper, accountability has not yet been well enough comprehended for all its different\norigins, meanings, implications and consequences to be sufficiently clear and explicable.\n100 J. Ritchie\nSo, despite being an increasingly required and, sometimes, even obligatory means for\nleveraging \u2018good governance\u2019, most notably by supposedly disclosing true performance\nbetter, accountability has not itself been suitably revealed. However, once its own\nconstruction has been made clear, actual accountability can become more questionable\nand less imperatively constituted, as a result. So, just when more required accountability\nshould supposedly diffuse across different governance regimes, its own distinct origins,\ncharacter and limitations stand exposed. This paper uses its own comparative framework\nfor the purposes of understanding and explaining how different accountabilities were\nreconfigured together across the entire East Asian economic miracle, crisis and recovery.\nIt recounts how, having first been very differently constituted for the original economic\nmiracle, accountability was then critically realized during the subsequent crisis and then\ndramatically reconfigured for due recovery since. It explains how the different origins,\ncharacter and limitations, as well as other affiliations of such reconfigured accountability,\nhad further implications and consequences which were not fully anticipated, but which\ncould become more apparent hereafter.\nReferences\nAlford, C.
