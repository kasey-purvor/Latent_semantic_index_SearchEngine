We ask three research questions: \n(1) How can we extend the absorptive capacity theory to explain the dynamic of knowledge activities \ninvolved in the ISD process?, (2) What are the ISD events that trigger knowledge activities during the \ncourse of municipal wireless network development?, and (3) How does a city create and utilize new \nknowledge in the development process? By framing ISD process as a dynamically emergent social \nprocess and knowledge is embedded in social actions, we develop the absorptive capacity model for \ninformation system development process and use it to analyze the role of prior knowledge, ISD events \nthat trigger knowledge activities, and the dynamic of knowledge activities in three case studies (Chaska, \nMN, Hermosa Beach, CA, and Fredericton, Canada). The results suggest a pattern of ISD events that \ntrigger knowledge creation across three cities including assignment of personnel, physical system \nconstruction, performance problems, resistance, and reassignment of organizational roles. The cities \nengaged in cycles of knowledge creation related to technology implementation, customer service, and \nrevenue models, among others. This research extends the absorptive capacity theory by suggesting four \nnew constructs that shapes the complexity of learning processes in ISD development. These constructs \ninclude the dynamic of technology development, partnership commitments, the roles of external \nknowledge, and learning-by-doing.  \n \nKeywords: absorptive capacity, information system development, infrastructure, broadband \ntechnology, municipal wireless network, Wi-Fi, public organization  \n_____________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n \n \n \n 3 \n1. Introduction  \nAccess to basic telecommunications services is considered as one of the necessities for individuals \nand organizations in the global information society (Crandall et al. 2007; Lee et al., 2003; Wilhelm, \n2003). The current U.S. broadband market is primarily dominated by a duopoly of the telephone and \ncable companies. As a result, broadband access and usage is concentrated among individuals and \nbusinesses in large cities and other economic booming cities (Horrigan et al., 2006). The lack of \ncompetition does not provide incentives for private operators to expand coverage to rural areas, lower \nprices, and upgrade the speeds (Daggett, 2007).  \nFollowing the ideology of the government\u2019s role as infrastructure developer (Gillett et al., 2004; \nSawyer et al., 2003), many cities in the U.S. have considered deploying municipal wireless networks \n(citywide networks) with the goals of universal, affordable access to broadband infrastructure for all. Jain \net al. (2007) defined municipal wireless networks as \u201cwireless Internet access networks developed with \nactive local leadership and involvement\u201d. Weill et al. (2002) classified the needs for infrastructure \ndevelopment into three levels: business unit, firm, and public infrastructure. By following this \nclassification, municipal wireless networks are viewed as public infrastructure with the goal to provide \nfundamental telecommunication services to the general public. According to muniwireless.com, the \nnumber of U.S. counties and cities that are in the deployment or planning stage of wireless broadband \nnetworks substantially grew by 240% from 122 in June 2005 to 415 in August 2007.  \nMunicipal wireless network projects provide an interesting study context and should add new \ntheoretical insights to the ISD and knowledge management literatures. This is because there are a number \nof challenges associated with a municipal wireless network project in addition to those found in \ntraditional ISD. First, several cities have an ambitious goal to have broadband coverage for the entire city \narea, thus making their project large in scope, and increase in complexity. The Wireless Philadelphia \nproject (http:\/\/wirelessphiladelphia.org), for example, has planned to cover 135 square mile area. Second, \nthere are a number of stakeholders, some of whom may have conflicting goals and interests. Mandviwalla \net al. (2008) reported at least 13 diverse stakeholders involved in the Wireless Philadelphia project \n 4 \nranging from state and city government, community residents, businesses, telecoms and ISPs, to public \nschools and higher educational institutions. Third, several have expressed serious concerns regarding \nwireless broadband technology including the scalability of the technology which was originally designed \nfor small-sized hotspots, the lack of standards for the mesh technology required to install wireless \nbroadband networks in large areas, and the possible rapid obsolescence due to new innovations and \nstandards (Jain et al., 2007). Fourth, some critics casted doubts on the capability of local government to \ndevelop and manage technology infrastructure including its lack of market discipline and technology \ncapability (Feiss, 2007), the overlook of major elements in the operation costs including maintenance and \nnetwork operations center costs (McClure, 2005), and its lack of resources to maintain the network in the \nlong run (Cox, 2004).    \nResearch in IT infrastructure and ISD has emphasized that experience, knowledge, and skills are \ncritical to convert IT components into valuable services (Armstrong & Sambamurthy, 1999; Byrd & \nTurner, 2000; Fink & Neumann, 2007). However, most studies in the IT infrastructure literature focus on \nexamining existing IT infrastructure and its components as antecedents of strategic organizational value \nincluding organizational agility (Fink & Neumann, 2007; Sambamurthy et al., 2003), organizational \nperformance (Bharadwaj, 2000; Bharadwaj et al., 1999; Brown et al., 1995), and process performance \n(Froehle, 2006; Karimi et al., 2007; Ray et al., 2005). Similarly, studies in the ISD literature concentrate \non using the variance approach to indentify antecedents of successful ISD projects (Sabherwal & Robey, \n1995; Sambamurthy and Kirsch, 2000). Several researchers suggest that studies concerning ISD process \nare required to advance our knowledge of the complex social process concerning systems development \n(Hirschheim et al., 1991; Sabherwal & Robey, 1993).   \nThe purpose of this paper is to extend the absorptive capacity theory to examine the dynamic of \nknowledge activities concerning ISD process in the context of municipal wireless networks. We frame \nISD as a dynamically emergent social process of complex interactions among stakeholders that shape the \noutcome of the development process (Hirschheim et al., 1991; Newman & Robey, 1991; Sambamurthy & \nKirsch, 2000). Following the guidelines for process research in organizations (Poole et al., 2000) and \n 5 \ninformation system development process approach (Kling & Iacono, 1984; Newman & Robey, 1992; \nSabherwal & Robey, 1993), we conceptualize ISD process as a sequence of events by highlighting critical \nevents that are unfold during the broadband network development process among selected U.S. from the \nknowledge management perspective.  \nThe specific research questions are: \n\u2022 How can we extend the absorptive capacity theory to explain the dynamic of knowledge activities \ninvolved in ISD process? \n\u2022 What are the ISD events that trigger knowledge activities during the course of municipal wireless \nnetwork development? \n\u2022 How does a city create and utilize new knowledge in the ISD process of municipal wireless \nnetwork development? \n \n2. Absorptive Capacity Model for Information System Development Process \n \nSambamurthy and Kirsch (2000, pp. 400-401) conceptualized ISD as a complex social process \nconcerning \u201cthe tasks that developers build technical artifacts and make technical choices within a \ncomplex social process that involves multiple stakeholders engaged in multiple agendas and transactions \nin their interactions with each other.\u201d Research has identified a number of factors that influence the \nsuccessful outcome of the ISD process: user participation (Ives & Olson, 1984; Kirsch & Beath, 1996), \ntop management support (Howell & Higgins, 1990; Jarvenpaa & Ives, 1991), and IS developers\u2019 expertise \n(Aladwani, 2002). More recently, ISD organizations have experienced significant shift in their external \nenvironment with the demands of high global competition that requires flexible and fast paced delivery of \ninformation systems (Lyytinen & Rose, 2006). Consequently, the ability to learn new technical changes \nand business opportunities and use them in IS delivery has become increasingly critical for ISD. More \nspecifically, a number of research suggests that absorptive capacity broadly defined as the ability to learn \nand apply new knowledge to improve performance (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990) is an important \n 6 \ndeterminant of effective learning and knowledge transfer, one of the key factors contributing to successful \nISD process (Hovorka & Larsen, 2006; Ko et al., 2005; Tiwana & McLean, 2005).  \nPentland (1995) suggested that knowledge must be understood in the context of embedded social \nactivities. Therefore, in our study, we situate knowledge activities in the context of ISD process in order \nto derive theoretically meaningful findings. The absorptive capacity theory seems to be an appropriate \nlens for this study because it provides a broad process framework of knowledge activities that enables us \nto develop theoretical insights of knowledge activities in ISD process. In addition, the absorptive capacity \nalso emphasizes how an organization integrates new knowledge with knowledge accumulated through \nprior experience and applies it to increase the performance. Such theorizing is consistent with evidence in \nISD research that prior knowledge about technical and IS development process and tasks increases the \nlikelihood of ISD project success (Faraj and Sambamurthy, 2006; Kirsch, 1996; Kotlarsky et al., 2007).  \nTo study knowledge activities embedded in ISD process, we use a recent framework by Zahra and \nGeorge (2002) who conceptualized absorptive capacity as a set of dynamic capabilities consisting of four \nknowledge activities: acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation. The model also suggests \nthat prior experience shapes knowledge activities. As discussed earlier, knowledge activities are \nembedded in ISD process, therefore, we theorize that events that trigger knowledge activities come from \nactivities related to ISD. We modified Sabherwal and Robey (1993)\u2019s classification of ISD activities as a \nguideline to identify relevant ISD events. In their extensive analysis of ISD projects in 50 organizations \nand more than 1,000 actions, Sabherwal and Robey (1993) classified detailed actions into 15 categories \nranging from assignment of personnel to the project, submission of proposal, to reassignment of \norganizational roles. Figure 1 illustrates our absorptive capacity model for information system \ndevelopment process. Although the diagram depicts the model using boxes and arrows similar to those \nfound in the variance approach, this study focuses on emergent knowledge process embedded in ISD \nprocess. The model suggests that ISD activities trigger knowledge activities and knowledge activities, in \nturn, shape subsequent ISD actions. Prior knowledge related to technical and management of ISD \n 7 \ndevelopment process influences the extent of knowledge activities. The theoretical concepts and their \ndefinitions are presented in Table 1. Next, we provide a brief overview of the concepts in the model. \n \nInsert Figure 1 about here \n \nInsert Table 1 about here \n \nISD Activities. Zahra and George (2002) suggested that events that trigger knowledge activities are \nthose internal or external triggers that induce efforts to seek knowledge to develop appropriate response \nmechanisms. Examples of internal triggers are performance failure, redefinition of an organization\u2019s \nstrategy, as well as other forms of organizational crises. External triggers are those events that emerge as \nchanges in an environment including technological shifts, radical innovations, and changes in government \npolicy. The formulation of internal and external triggers is conceptually similar to events that arise \nthroughout ISD process (e.g., user complaining about a system, cancellation of an IS project, vendors \ngoing out of business, and key IS personnel resigning). Sabherwal and Robey (1993) classified micro-\nlevel ISD activities into 15 event types. We modified their classification by removing events that are \nconsidered knowledge activities according to Zahra and George\u2019s definitions. These events include \nseeking technical knowledge, training, and reassignment of organizational roles. Consequently, twelve \nevents are maintained to activate knowledge activities: assignment of personnel to the IS project, \nsubmission of proposal, approval or authorization, project definition, assessment of performance, vendor \nselection, system construction, performance problems, successful performance, resistance, acceptance or \ncooperation, and others.  \nPrior Knowledge. Argote (1999) suggests that prior knowledge is embedded in people, technology, \nstructures and routines. The ability to absorb new external knowledge depends on the level of prior \nrelated knowledge. This suggests that the development of absorptive capacity is a path-dependent process \n(Cohen & Levinthal, 1990). Customer interactions, alliances with other firms, and learning-by-doing are \nsome of the ways an organization can gain its experiences (Lane & Lubatkin, 1998; Nonaka & Takeuchi, \n 8 \n1995). In the ISD context, several studies reported that prior knowledge in forms of IS development \nprocess, technical capability, domain knowledge, and project management is critical to project \nperformance (Faraj & Sambamurthy, 2006; Kirsch, 1996; Slaughter & Kirsch, 2006).  \nKnowledge Acquisition. ISD knowledge can be acquired from internal or external sources. Internal \nknowledge acquisition occurs through knowledge sharing among ISD stakeholders including users, \nproject managers, business unit managers, and IS specialists in different work units such as development \nspecialists, maintenance specialists, and quality assurance specialists. The complexity of IS projects \nincreasingly requires organizations to rely on external consultants and multiple technology partners for \nhelp in developing and implementing these systems.  \nKnowledge Assimilation. Knowledge assimilation refers to routines and processes that allow an \norganization to interpret and understand new ideas learned from external sources (Zahra & George, 2002). \nAn organization faces several challenges in comprehending knowledge acquired from external sources. \nFor example, external knowledge may have heuristics that depart from those used by an organization \n(Leonard-Barton, 1995). The tacitness, specificity, and complexity of external knowledge can generate \ncausal ambiguity between knowledge and outcomes which can prevents others from replication (Reed & \nDeFillippi, 1990). In addition, interorganizational learning research also suggests that the ability to \nassimilate new external knowledge is greater when the two firms share similar systems for processing \nknowledge (Lane & Lubatkin, 1998). In the IS context, Hovorka and Larsen (2006)\u2019s findings suggest \nthat knowledge assimilation is related to IT attitudes, prior experience with IT, and training.  \nKnowledge Transformation. Once an organization interprets and understands new knowledge, the \nnext challenge it faces is how to absorb the new knowledge into the existing knowledge system. \nKnowledge transformation involves an organization\u2019s capability to develop routines to combine new \nknowledge with the existing knowledge (Zahra & George, 2002). Cohen and Levinthal (1990) suggest \nthat internal organization mechanisms that enable knowledge sharing across organization members are \nnecessary for the new knowledge to be integrated into an organization. In the ISD environment, Slaughter \nand Kirsch (2006) identified several mechanisms for internal knowledge sharing including meetings, \n 9 \nbulletin boards, internal training classes, transfer of personnel, and informal demo. Ko et al. (2005), in \ntheir study of knowledge transfer between consultants and business users in ERP implementations, found \nthat knowledge-related, communication-related, and motivational factors influence the extent of \nknowledge transfer. \nKnowledge Exploitation. The new absorbed knowledge has to be applied for an organization to derive \nassociated benefits. Knowledge exploitation refers to an organization\u2019s capability to extend its \ncompetencies, enhance performance, or increase innovation by incorporating transformed knowledge into \noperations (Zahra & George, 2002). Cohen and Levinthal (1990) suggest that the ease of knowledge \nutilization depends on the extent to which an outside knowledge is targeted to the needs and concerns of a \nrecipient firm. Lane and Lubatkin (1998), in their study of alliances between pharmaceutical firms and \nbiotechnology firms, found that the experiences in which two organizations share in solving similar types \nof problems make it easier for a recipient organization to find applications of the new knowledge. \nSimilarly, Malhotra et al. (2005), in their study of supply chain partners, found that joint decision making \nhelps firms to develop a deep understanding of the knowledge needs of their partners.  \n \n3. Research Methods and Data \n3.1 Case Study Method \nMunicipal wireless networks have been recent efforts by several cities to address the lack of \naffordable broadband services offered by private companies. Our objectives are to understand the required \nknowledge and associated knowledge activities and to help generate theory to better support the learning \nprocesses. At this stage of municipal wireless network development, a comparative case study is an \nappropriate methodology for three reasons. First, the case study is a viable method for studying areas that \nare underdeveloped in the literature (Benbasat et al., 1987). Second, the case study method is particularly \nwell suited for studying phenomena that cannot easily be distinguished from its context (e.g., ISD \nprocess, organizational structure, prior experience). Third, multiple case studies also increase the validity \nand generalizability of the findings as well as theory development and testing (Benbasat et al., 1987; Yin, \n 10 \n2003, p. 46). Inductively generalizing from a single case study is epistemologically problematic and runs \nthe risk of being easily falsified by a single counterexample (Benbasat et al., 1987).  \nWe chose Chaska, Minnesota, Hermosa Beach, California and Fredericton, Canada for four reasons. \nFirst, these cities have varying levels of experience on ISD and broadband technology, thus making them \ntheoretical diverse from the absorptive capacity perspective. Second, the three cities were among the early \nadopters of municipal wireless networks; therefore, they have relatively long term data and offer richer \ninsights into the development process. Third, the fact that these cities located in different geographical \nlocations with different socio-economic and political conditions can help increase the generalizability of \nour findings. Fourth, the three cities do not necessarily share the same goals for their municipal wireless \nnetworks. Such diverse goals may shape different knowledge activities during their development \nprocesses.   \n3.2 Data Collection \nWe use a retrospective research method by relying on interview data, archival documents, and related \narticles and interviews published in the popular press. Sabherwal and Robey (1995) suggested that the \naccuracy of the data from the retrospective inquiry is preserved when there is a reasonably short elapsed \ntime between the completion of the ISD project and the start of data collection. In our case, all three cities \nfinished the development process around 2005 and our data collection period was done between February \nand July 2007, representing an average of 14 - 19 months elapsed time.  \nWe collected evidence from multiple sources for each case study. The interview transcripts, city \ncouncil minutes, prior interviews given by city personnel, popular press coverage of the projects, and \npublic discussion forums are used as the source to identify ISD events. For each of the three case studies, \nwe interviewed key personnel who participated in strategic development, network architectural design, \nand implementation of the municipal wireless projects. Table 2 summarizes our data collection efforts. \nArchival data constituted more than 250 pages of rich and detailed information through the entire \ndevelopment process of the municipal wireless projects.  \n \n 11 \nInsert Table 2 about here \n \n3.3 Data Analysis Strategy \nSince the objective of this research is to develop an understanding of the complex knowledge creation \nin municipal wireless network projects, we use a process research method to analyze the data. Process \nresearch is appropriate for this study for a number of reasons. First, the process approach offers an inquiry \nmode that allows us to develop theoretical explanation to indicate how the learning process unfolds over \ntime and identify causal inferences of the mediating steps through which causality acts through an \ninitiating event and subsequent events. Second, the process analysis shares similar ontological \nassumptions with the absorptive capacity concerning the role of prior events. That is, the absorptive \ncapacity argues that learning is path-dependent (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990) and process analysis suggests \nthat \u201can entity\u2019s current state can be understood only in terms of the history of events that preceded it\u201d \n(Poole et al., 2000, p. 12). Third, process analysis enables researchers to develop theoretical contribution \nthrough unanticipated events discovered during the process analysis (Whetten, 1989)   \nPoole et al. (2000) suggested that process researchers should use an appropriate analysis method \ndepending on the number of cases and the number of events in the chosen cases. In this study, where there \nare three cases and each case does not have a large number of events, summary case studies that highlight \nthe focal ISD events and dynamic of knowledge creation is justified. Events were coded according to \nSabherwal and Robey (1993)\u2019s classification of ISD events followed by coding of knowledge activities \nthat were triggered by ISD events.  \nNext, we provide an overview of the wireless mesh technology that all three cities chose for their \nmunicipal wireless networks before we present the findings. \n \n4. The Wireless Broadband Technology: Wi-Fi Mesh  \nIn recent years, Wi-Fi technology (IEEE 802.11 a\/b\/g\/n) has become an attractive choice to provide \nbroadband Internet access. The proliferation and adoption of wireless technology has been successful for \n 12 \nthree reasons (Bar and Galperin, 2004; Bar and Park, 2006). First, the FCC did not require a license for \nthe 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectrum; the airwave spectrum in which Wi-Fi works. Second, standardization \nas specified by the Wi-Fi Alliance and the IEEE organization led to an interoperability standard. Third, \nthe large scale production of Wi-Fi chipsets resulted in low unit costs for Wi-Fi equipment, fueling the \ntechnology's integration as standard equipment in portable computers. \nMore recently, new developments have enabled Wi-Fi technology to be implemented in a large \ngeographical area through adds-on mesh technology. In Wi-Fi mesh technology, Wi-Fi routers are \ntypically installed outdoors by mounting on external structures such as buildings or lampposts to get a \nbroad coverage throughout a city. The Wi-Fi routers (or access points or nodes) communicate with each \nother wirelessly through a mesh routing algorithm to allow users to connect to the Internet, thus \nminimizing the need to have each router connecting directly to the Internet. Wi-Fi mesh network requires \na selected number of access points to be attached to the backbone network that connects to the Internet. \nThese access points are often referred to as backhaul nodes. The rest of the access points can connect to \nthe backhaul nodes by taking multiple hops from one access point to another wirelessly. Figure 2 \nillustrates Wi-Fi mesh network architecture.  \n \nInsert Figure 2 about here \n \n5. Findings \n5.1 Municipal Wireless Network Projects \nThe three cities chosen for this research are diverse in terms of geographical locations and perhaps \ntheir goals related to their municipal wireless projects but they share some similarities in terms of being \nrelatively small cities and they are all considered pioneers in their municipal wireless broadband efforts. \nChaska is located 20 miles southwest of downtown Minneapolis in Minnesota. According to the \nmetropolitan council estimates, Chaska\u2019s population was 22,467 with 8,194 households in 2005. The \nestimated per capital income was $44,137. About 3.4% of families and 4.7% of the population were \n 13 \nbelow the poverty line. The city\u2019s area is approximately 14.5 square miles. The objective of developing a \nmunicipal wireless network (Chaska.net) highlights the concept of community:  \u201c\u2026 develop a high \nquality, low cost, high speed Internet service for Chaska\u2019s public,  business, and residential entities, \nthereby enhancing Chaska\u2019s vision of being a connecting community\u201d, according to the Chaska.net\u2019s \nmission.  \nHermosa Beach is located in the South Bay region of the greater Los Angeles area. The city\u2019s area is \napproximately 5.9 square miles. As of the 2000 census, Hermosa\u2019s population was 18,566. There were \n9,476 households, and 3,553 families residing in the city. The per capita income for the city was $54,244. \nAbout 1.7% of families and 4.6% of the population were below the poverty line. The mayor gave two \nreasons for building the municipal wireless network known as Wi-Fi Hermosa Beach. First, he stated \n\u201cWhen we first came up with the idea for a citywide network, we did it because there were only two \nchoices, Cable and DSL. Both provided poor service, especially video and were really expensive. We \nknew we could do it better and cheaper. Second, he firmly believes that broadband Internet should be \ntreated as a public service or utility and offered by the city, paid for by tax dollars.  \nFredericton is a small urban city, located in southern New Brunswick, Canada. The city is a regional \ncenter for knowledge-based industries, with more than 70% of the province\u2019s high-tech economic \nactivity. According to the 2006 census, the city of Fredericton had a population of 50,035. Among the \npopulation, 37.2% has a university degree. The average family income was $70,000 per year.  The area of \nthe city is 50 square miles. The city projects its municipal wireless network known as Fred-eZone as a \npart of infrastructure to become a smart city. The executive director of the city\u2019s economic development \ndepartment stated \u201cAs a municipality, we already provide infrastructure\u2014roads, sidewalks, and water \ndistribution systems\u2014we\u2019re just adding connectivity to the list. Projects like Fred-eZone contribute to \nFredericton\u2019s image as a smart, progressive city, a place where people want to live, play, learn, and \nwork.\u201d \nTable 3 provides a summary of the key features of these projects.  \n \n 14 \nInsert Table 3 about here \n \n \nNext, we analyze the three case studies according to the theoretical framework in Figure 1. Our \nanalysis highlights the role of prior knowledge in new knowledge creation, ISD events that trigger \nknowledge activities, and the dynamic of knowledge activities.  \n5.2 The Role of Prior Knowledge \nAll three cities had some prior experience with broadband development. At the beginning of its \nwireless broadband project, Chaska had about four years experience providing Internet services to the \nschool district and businesses. In 2000, the city partnered with the school district to construct and \nmaintain fiber optic connections. The school district agreed to pay all the costs associated with the \nconstruction and ongoing maintenance of the system with the condition that the city owns the fiber lines. \nAround the same time, the city also partnered with KMC (now CenturyTel) by granting KMC the right to \nutilize the city\u2019s right-of-way in their fiber optic installation with the agreement that KMC would \nconstruct a public fiber network to serve several city facilities.  \nLater in 2001, the city began expanding their high speed fiber network service to Chaska businesses. \nIn 2002, the city decided to expand to more affordable broadband services through a line of sight 2.4 GHz \npoint-to-multipoint wireless network. In 2003, the service was expanded to other nearby cities including \nVictoria, Waconia, Norwood, Young America, and Shakopee. The city had 71 business customers for \ntheir fixed wireless network services in April 2004. On one hand, Chaska\u2019s experience and knowledge \nthat they had as an ISP as well as its existing backhaul infrastructure makes it easier for the city to \nimplement the wireless network as the city manager puts it \u201cThat was the advantage that we had. We had \nbeen an ISP. There were a small number of customers but all the backroom kind of stuff \u2013 connection to \nthe Internet, we had all that.\u201d However, at the implementation level, some of the prior knowledge proves \nto be contradictory to the requirement of Wi-Fi mesh technology. For example, the IS manager stated \u201cAs \na fixed wireless operator, we kept on thinking along the lines of how high can we get those antennas to \n 15 \nhave a clear line of sight. But with a mesh system, that is not the right approach to take. Tropos \nrecommended keeping the nodes \u2026 around 15 to 20 feet off the ground.\u201d \nUnlike the city of Chaska, the city of Hermosa Beach did not have direct prior experience and \nknowledge to draw on. The city leased telephone connections from a telecommunications provider to \nsupport city operations. However, the mayor at that time had two years experience with a Wi-Fi hotspot \nin his own local bakery and caf\u00e9. With that knowledge in hand, he and the city manager presented the \nidea of operating a citywide Wi-Fi network to the city council in 2003. Since the two individuals did not \nhave in-depth knowledge about the network and its implementations, they worked with a company, \nWireless Facilities Inc., to draft details about the network and its benefits to the city. During the course of \nthe Wi-Fi Hermosa Beach development, it appears that the knowledge they need is related to revenue \nmodels of the network operation.   \nSimilar to the city of Chaska, the city of Fredericton had extensive experience and knowledge as an \nISP prior to its wireless network development. In 1999, Fredericton responded to the problem of the lack \nof affordable broadband connectivity by investing in a fiber ring that delivered high-speed connectivity to \nthe city and other businesses. Under the regulations of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications \nCommission (CRTC), a broadband provider requires a license to operate the business. To address this \nregulatory requirement, a city-owned company staffed by city employees, e-Novations, was created and \nreceived accreditation as a non-dominant telecommunications carrier. The company allows the city to \nown the infrastructure and provides a means for local businesses to pool their resources to lease \nbandwidth on the city-owned fiber optic cables. The network infrastructure consists of a combination of \nfiber optic and point-to-point wireless technology by Motorola which serve as an important asset for \nFredericton to easily expand the broadband services to the public.  \n5.3 ISD Events and the Dynamic of Knowledge Creation \nTable 4, 5, and 6 presents the ISD events, description of events, timeline, and related knowledge \nactivities triggered by those ISD events for the cities of Chaska, Hermosa Beach, and Fredericton \n 16 \nrespectively. There appears to be a pattern of ISD events that triggered knowledge activities across the \nthree projects. These ISD events include the assignment of personnel, physical system construction, \nperformance problems, resistance, and reassignment of organizational roles. \n5.3.1 Assignment of Personnel \n Assignment of personnel to begin the project prompted the project leaders in all three cities to \nacquire knowledge to identify an appropriate technology choice in the case of Chaska and Fredericton and \nto write an RFP in the case of Hermosa Beach. Note that the cities engaged in various means to acquire \nand integrate knowledge from different sources to make their decisions. For example, the cities of Chaska \nand Fredericton learned in-depth technology knowledge by following the industry and talking to a number \nof vendors. The mayor and city manager of the City of Hermosa Beach chose to adapt background \nknowledge they learned from municipal wireless conferences to write their own RFP.  \n5.3.2 Physical System Construction \nSince the city of Hermosa Beach outsourced the design and implementation to an outside company, \nLA Unplugged, and their first phase implementation was relatively small (9 outdoor routers covering 35% \nof the city area), they did not have to deal with various issues arising during the physical system \nconstruction. The city manager stated, \u201cLA Unplugged bought the equipment from Strix Systems \n(http:\/\/www.strixsystems.com) and assembled the boxes and the network. After that they provided one \nyear of operational maintenance. I think the company folded since then.\u201d \nIn contrast, the physical system construction for Chaska and Fredericton triggered them to engage in \nnew knowledge creation around specifics of the Wi-Fi mesh implementation. Both cities integrated their \nprior knowledge as telecommunications or wireless operators to install the Wi-Fi mesh systems with \nhelps from their partners and experienced consultants to translate generic technology knowledge (e.g., \nfrequencies, number and locations of outdoor nodes, and number of hops from a given outdoor node to a \nbackhaul node) to specific city conditions. For example, Chaska worked with First Mile Wireless, a \nreseller and integrator of wireless solutions and an authorized reseller of Tropos, to plan and install the \n 17 \nnetwork. The city completed the installation of 230 Tropos 5110 routers on city-owned assets \npredominantly street lights through out the 14 square miles of the city in June 2004. Backhaul was \ninstalled at 36 locations around the city using the existing city\u2019s infrastructure including the point-to-\nmultipoint wireless links and fiber network.  \nFredericton chose Cisco systems for their Wi-Fi mesh network and worked closely with the company. \nThe city IT manager praised the working relationships they had with CISCO, \u201cThe CISCO team worked \ntirelessly with us to fine tune the signal overlays, resolve radio signal interference issues, and educate our \npeople so we could sustain the network after it was completed.\u201d He described the city\u2019s learning as \nintegrating pillars of separate knowledge provided by contractors, saying \u201chow to create backhaul \nnetworks and virtual LANS and distribute IP addresses, that (expertise) you have got to bring in from the \noutside, but you have to understand how to maintain it.\u201d \n5.3.3 Performance Problems \nLater in the project, Fredericton and Chaska, in particular, had a series of performance problems \n(disappointing customer services, unreliable connections, interference problems, network abuse, and \nquality downgrade) that triggered knowledge creation to address those issues. Throughout its Wi-Fi mesh \ndeployment, Chaska faced a number of challenges with the system. First, the city realized that Wi-Fi \nmesh technology requires significant fine-tuning according to the city\u2019s various topologies, buildings, \nstreet conditions, and dense tree neighborhoods. The city started out with 230 routers in early 2004. In \nAugust 2007, the city had 378 routers, with 148 routers added or a 64% increase from the original plan. \nThe IT manager admitted in his interview reported by Hughlett (2007) that \u201cThere were a lot of \npreconceived notions that you could just blast Wi-Fi signals through walls and trees and everything. We \ndiscovered that wet, leafy trees absorb radio signals. Wi-Fi signals don\u2019t pass through stucco like they did \nwooden walls.\u201d The city also found that if the number of hops grows beyond 3 or 4 hops to a gateway, the \nspeed significantly drops down to dial-up grade service or even worse. This has become a problem in \nneighborhoods that are a long way from where gateways are located. In summer 2005, the city replaced \n 18 \nthe routers in one neighborhood with the newer 5210 Tropos routers. According to the city\u2019s \nadministrative service director, that neighborhood experienced improvement in the quality of signal \ncoverage because the 5210 technology works at different frequencies and it supports greater distance. \nSecond, the technology was new at the time the city begun its deployment. \u201cWe are being one of the first \nor even the first to do a complete city Wi-Fi. There were still bugs that need to be worked out. We had a \nnumber of issues that hardware suppliers and software suppliers had not really thought about.\u201d said the \ncity manager. Finally, Wi-Fi mesh technology had been improving at a rapid rate between 2004 and 2005. \nOnly in one and a half year into its operation, the city replaced all of its Tropos 5110 routers with the \nnewer 5210 ones. The city\u2019s administrative service director explained, \u201cTropos created resolutions for \nsome of the problems that we initially saw on 5110. We would be working on a problem and then we \ncalled Tropos and they said that the problem had been resolved in the 5210 model, or that is not available \nin 5110 but it is on 5210. There is a bit of frustration on our part. We were only into this for a year and a \nhalf, the new features that we help identify and we need were not going to be available in 5110.\u201d  \nIn addition to the technical issues, Chaska also recognized that their customer service experience and \nknowledge with being an ISP to business customers did not prepare them for residential customers as the \ncity manager admitted \u201cAs you move to residential customers, that is a whole different kind of customer \nservice because they weren\u2019t as computer savvy and so we received more calls.\u201d Moreover, the city did \nnot have the necessary tools to track and analyze calls to differentiate old problems from new ones. \nAccording to Hughlett (2007), Chaska had 1,100 residents signed up to use the service in 2005 but 800 of \nthose left partly because of the lack of support and unreliable network access.  \nTo respond to the immediate problem, the city hired additional temporary staff to extend the customer \nservice hours. Eventually, the city discovered that the network connectivity problems were tightly related \nto customer services because most of the problems users called in for help were related to connectivity. \nTherefore, the customer service support needed to have necessary knowledge and information about \nnetwork performance to respond to connectivity issues. However, the city did not have expertise and tools \nin these two areas. So, they made the decision to outsource the network operation center and customer \n 19 \nservice to Siemens.   \nSimilar to Chaska, Fredericton encountered interference from other routers, as well as reliability \nissues related to applications used on the network.  Initially, all of their routers were connected to one \nbackhaul bandwidth point, thus overwhelming the antenna with \u201cbroadcast storms\u201d leading to \nmalfunctioning routers. To address this issue, the city fixed the design flaw of the network by separating \nthe network into three virtual networks, each with its own broadcast tower connected to the fiber network. \nThe three broadcast towers are located on the city water tower, a clock tower, and at the city\u2019s Knowledge \nPark business park.  \nThe Fred e-Zone does not require users to log in to begin a session. However, the system records \nusers\u2019 MAC addresses when they begin a session. The network was originally designed as a completely \nopen network with no traffic shaping.  When the popular application BitTorrent was launched, speeds on \nthe entire network including the fiber backbone slowed incredibly due to Fred-eZone users exchanging \nfiles.  The network managers introduced traffic shaping protocols that throttled peer-to-peer traffic \nAccording to the city\u2019s IT manager, Fredericton was becoming known as an international hotspot for \nspammers. To address the problem, the city rate limited the peer-to-peer traffic and blocked virus ports. \nWhile ports that use mail sending proxies like SMTP are not blocked, there is a limit of 10 messages per \nday that can be sent using SMTP, and outgoing mail messages are intercepted and run through an anti-\nvirus program. Therefore, the network managers can determine the number of spam messages sent \nthrough the network. The Fred-eZone blocks users who abuse the network by sending spam or using too \nmuch bandwidth, as well as limiting the amount of bandwidth allocated to the e-Zone during business \nhours.  \n5.3.4 Resistance \nOne of the ISD events that triggered new knowledge creation for Hermosa Beach is the resistance \nfrom some council members to the citywide deployment. In late 2004 to early 2005, the city considered \nexpanding the current network to cover the entire city. The cost of the expansion was estimated around \n 20 \n$126,000. In November 2004, the city council received feedback from citizens and businesses about the \nusage and benefits of the current network and their opinions about the expansion during one of the \ncouncil meetings. However, more information particularly a possibility of a franchise business model \nthrough a partnership with an ISP, and an estimated monthly cost-revenue plan is needed for the city \ncouncil to make the decision. To satisfy the request, the city manager identified other cities in California \n(e.g., city of Cerritos, city of West Hollywood) that have planned to enter into a partnership with an ISP \nto offer a citywide broadband service. Internet service providers are motivated to partner with those cities \nbecause of potential revenues in the areas of cities where a telephone and a cable company do not offer \nbroadband services. However, it is unclear if the same business model will work for the city of Hermosa \nBeach when its residents have several options of broadband services from the existing telephone and \ncable companies.  \nIn addition, the city manager also consulted with the contractor to get a more accurate estimation of \ntotal cost, total revenue, and replacement costs and schedule. In the end, the citywide deployment \nproposal failed to gain approval. Finally, another external event that seems to put an end to the citywide \nproject is the change from the former mayor who was enthusiastic about the citywide deployment to new \nmayor who strongly opposed to the project.  \n5.3.5 Reassignment of Organizational Roles \nFinally, Chaska experienced the departure of a few lead personnel who are knowledgeable about the \nWi-Fi mesh deployment in early 2006. The city manager stated, \u201cIt was a big deal and it was probably \none of our ongoing challenges. There are limited numbers of people who understand how Wi-Fi system \nworks.\u201d A new IT manager was hired in late 2006. To get him up to speed with Wi-Fi mesh technology, \nthe city sent him to a training course with Tropos. According to the new IT manager, \u201cIt was a very good \nweek of exploration of equipment, how to configure 5210, how to perform installation of 5210, and what \noptimal deployment looks like from a geographical standpoint.\u201d  \nTable 7 summarizes the prior experience, ISD events, and knowledge activities during their municipal \n 21 \nwireless network deployment.  \n \nInsert Table 7 about here \n \n6.  Discussion \n This research studies new knowledge creation activities embedded in the ISD development process \nin the context of municipal wireless networks. Faced with the new technology, the cities rely on external \nknowledge from their private partners to successfully deploy wireless broadband networks. Cohen and \nLevinthal (1990) suggest that the development of absorptive capacity is domain-specific and path \ndependent in which having some absorptive capacity in a certain area enables an organization to acquire \nand exploit related knowledge in the future. In addition, an exposure to new knowledge influences an \norganization\u2019s decision making (March and Simon, 1993). In our case, the knowledge developed through \nthe citywide backhaul infrastructure development that the cities of Chaska and Fredericton undertook is \nvaluable in at least two ways. First, it permits them to better understand and evaluate the potential value \nof wireless broadband technologies. Second, it offers the opportunity for the city staff to develop \nexpertise and an understanding of the city\u2019s broadband needs. Beyond the knowledge accumulation, the \ninvestment in backhaul infrastructure and the availability of unused fiber capacity make it more \neconomical to add the front-end wireless broadband services.    \nHowever, deploying a wireless broadband network involves complex knowledge that needs to be \ncustomized to the needs and physical conditions of a city. Our case study data indicate several areas \nwhere the absorptive capacity model should be extended to address the complexity of learning processes \ninvolved in ISD development. The four constructs emerged from our analysis are: dynamic of technology \ndevelopment, partnership commitments, the limitation of external knowledge, and learning- by- doing. \nThe revised absorptive capacity model for information system development is presented in Figure 3.  \n \nInsert Figure 3 about here \n 22 \n6.1 Dynamic of Technology Development \nIn 2004, Chaska, Hermosa Beach, and Fredericton were considered pioneers in using Wi-Fi mesh \ntechnology for municipal wireless networks. Most of the technologies were still under development. \nThere were a few industry players who offered Wi-Fi mesh products at the time. In addition, vendors had \nlimited or in some cases no experiences in deploying Wi-Fi mesh in a large geographical area. In \nChaska\u2019s case, Tropos had previously implemented Wi-Fi systems in selected applications including \npublic safety, police, and fire usage. Similarly, Hermosa Beach had to adapt routers from Strix Systems \nthat were originally designed for indoor use for their outdoor project. Later on in December 2004, Strix \nSystems introduced weatherized rugged routers with better coverage and improved power transmission \nspecifically designed for outdoor use. If the second phase of Hermosa Beach Wi-Fi project had been \napproved by the city council, the city would have had to go through replacing some of the existing routers \nfor the newer and better models. Chaska went through the upgrade like this in April 2005 when Tropos \nreleased its 5210 routers (801.11g) which are far better than the 5110 model (802.11b) in terms of \ncapacity and enhanced multi-use network capabilities.  \nThe continuing development of Wi-Fi and other related wireless technology has implications on \nlearning and performance. First, cities have had to keep pace with technological development and have \nhad to learn and evaluate new technologies that might offer better features or solve some of the current \nissues the cities experience. In addition, as early adopters of the new technology, cities are also involved \nin co-learning with their partners to identify problems with the current technology with the intention that \nthe vendor partner will resolve these issues in the next technology generation. As a result, cities might not \nget the optimum performance that the technology has to offer in its current generation.  \n6.2 Partnership Commitments \nChaska and Fredericton worked closely with their private partners in the design and management of \nthe networks while Hermosa Beach chose a hands-off approach by outsourcing the design and \nmanagement to a private company. Chaska worked closely with Tropos and their staff to implement the \nWi-Fi mesh network and integrate other solutions to deliver Internet services. All three Chaska key \n 23 \npersonnel whom we interviewed shared similar views of the strong partnership from Tropos. The city\u2019s \nadministrative service director summarizes Tropos\u2019s commitment as follows: \u201cThe thing that I have to \ngive Tropos a lot of credits is they really step up and provided us access to a lot of their systems engineers \nand some of their key field people to help us with the deployment at the time it was certainly one of the \nlargest deployment that they had done and also the largest deployment of varying topologies.\u201d Similarly, \nthe IT manager of Fredericton, attributes the project success to the partner, Cisco, who donated equipment \nand provided essential expertise developing the network. \nIn addition to a partnership with Tropos, Chaska also enjoyed a long, ongoing relationship with First \nMile Wireless, who has partnered with the city on a prior line of sight wireless service for businesses. \nFirst Mile Wireless CEO is very knowledgeable in wireless technology and he has provided extensive \nassistance to help the city understand Tropos technology and how to transform the knowledge into \npractice including frequency allocations, effective coverage of routers in the field, and adaptation to \ntopologies and challenges in the implementation environment.   \nStrong partnerships offer partners the opportunity to learn from and about each other. The notion of \npartnership commitment in our research relates to trust in strategic alliances and joint venture research \n(Koza & Lewin, 1998; Lane et al., 2001). Kumar (1996) defined trust as dependability by the partners and \neach partner is interested in the welfare of each other. Successful alliances and joint ventures exhibit trust \nbetween partners. Trust is also important to absorptive capacity because it stimulates open sharing of \nvaluable information and tacit knowledge (Inkpen & Beamish, 1997). \n6.3 Roles of External Knowledge and Learning-by-doing \nKnowledge related to new technologies is likely to be located outside of an organization (Konsynski \n& Tiwana, 2004; Van den Bosch et al., 1999) The rapid change of Wi-Fi mesh technology and the limited \nexperience in Wi-Fi deployment in the industry requires a city to try out knowledge learned from the \nindustry, evaluate the performance, and readjust their knowledge based on feedback from actual \nexperience. In the case of the city of Fredericton, the network was originally designed to be a completely \nopen network with minimal control and security monitoring. After the first year of operation, the city \n 24 \ndiscovered that peer-to-peer traffic and spam significantly slowed down the network speed for users. As a \nresult, the city blocked known virus ports, limited a number of e-mail messages sent, and scanned \noutgoing e-mail messages for viruses.  \nThe implementation of Tropos routers in Chaska also illustrates the feedback loop between the \nexternal knowledge available through private partners and knowledge discovered through practice (Saccol \n& Reinhard, 2006). Chaska learned from Tropos that every 5th or 6th routers needs to be connected via a \ngateway to backhaul connection. However, after implementing routers according to this standard rule, the \ncity experienced problems in signal strength and unacceptable speeds leading to unreliable and low \nquality Internet services. This is because some areas in Chaska had dense tree lines and green vegetation, \nwhile other areas had no gateways close by. In addition, some materials used to build houses can also \nblock out signals. The city worked closely with Tropos to resolve the issues by limiting the number of \nhops to 3 to 4 hops, adding gateways, and revising frequency plans. Chaska went through a process of \niterative knowledge discovery and had to adjust knowledge previously learned according to various \nconditions of the city.  \nThe city administrative service director described Chaska\u2019s learning experience as, \u201cA lot of \nknowledge that we have obtained has been through our efforts of trying something, see how it is \nperformed, looking at alternative solutions, trying these alternative solutions and working to create what \nis the best combination to meet the needs of a particular area\u2026 The first two years we continue to make a \nlot of discoveries. We know that it is not just drawing a circle and positioning these radios but we also \nhave to take into account the topology.\u201d  \nThe knowledge discovery process not only benefits Chaska but it also significantly benefits Tropos. \nMr. Ron Sege, president and CEO of Tropos, in his comment article on muniwirless.com said \u201cThe \nlessons learned in deploying Chaska spawned many mesh software innovations and a new class of \nanalysis tools that will dramatically decrease the time needed to optimize networks in the future.\u201d \nThe relationship between Tropos and Chaska and the mutual benefits that they share in new \nknowledge creation relates to the collaborator supply chain relationships studied in Malhotra et al. (2005). \n 25 \nIn their study of RosettaNet consortium in the IT industry, they found that firms that engage in \ncollaborator type partnerships achieved high knowledge creation by exchanging privileged information \nand engaging in joint decision making.  \n6.4 ISD Development Process \nOur findings are also consistent with others who reported that IT personnel requires both technical \nand managerial knowledge and skills to facilitate transformation process of IT components into effective \nservices (Basselier & Benbasat, 2004; Fink & Neumann, 2007; Melville et al., 2004; Ross et al., 1996). \nKey technical expertise includes hardware diagnosis and maintenance, application development, systems \nintegration and maintenance, and network management and maintenance (Byrd & Turner, 2000; Melville \net al., 2004). Managerial skills include the ability to plan, organize, and lead projects, work \ncollaboratively in a team environment, and complete projects within time and budget constraints, among \nothers (Byrd & Turner, 2000; Fink & Neumann, 2007; Lee et al., 1995). \nThe Hermosa Beach project that was led by the mayor and the city manager is similar to the user-led \nproject in Sabherwal and Robey (1995)\u2019s classification. This kind of project is characterized by low \nparticipation of IS personnel, early technical knowledge seeking mostly from those external to the \norganization rather than from in-house IS personnel, and the lack of explicit performance evaluation. \nSome of these conditions may explain why the Hermosa Beach project experienced technical difficulties \nand resistance from those who were not directly involved in the project. Note that all three projects \nemployed the implementation process that Sabherwal and Robey (1993) referred to as \u201coutsourced \ncooperative\u201d in which the three cities cooperated extensively with external parties to provide technical \nknowledge, consultation on the implementation details, and network components and management \nsoftware. As a result, the cities had little control over the project and were vulnerable to external events. \nSome of these events are the dissolution of the external partner in the case of Hermosa Beach and the \nobsolescence of routers within a short period of time in the case of Chaska.  \n \n7. Conclusion \n 26 \nThis research extends the absorptive capacity theory to examine the dynamic of knowledge activities \nconcerning ISD process in the context of municipal wireless networks.  By framing ISD process as a \ndynamically emergent social process and knowledge is embedded in social actions, we develop the \nabsorptive capacity model for information system development process and use it to examine the role of \nprior knowledge, ISD events that trigger knowledge activities, and the dynamic of knowledge activities in \nthree case studies (Chaska, MN, Hermosa Beach, CA, and Fredericton, Canada).  \nThis paper makes at least two contributions. First, we develop a theory of absorptive capacity for ISD \ndevelopment by using a sequence of events to explain the outcome of the ISD process. By doing so, we \nare able to preserve detailed information about actions and how they unfold over time that lead to \ndifferent outcomes (Sabherwal & Robey, 1995). Consequently, our research answers the call by many \nISD researchers for process research to offer richer insights to understand such complex social \nphenomenon (Sabherwal and Robey, 1995; Sambamurthy & Kirsch, 2000).  \nA second contribution is that we extend the absorptive capacity by suggesting that dynamic of \ntechnology development, partnership commitments, limitation of external knowledge, and learning by \ndoing shapes the dynamic of new knowledge creation. We believe that these four constructs might be \ngeneralizable to other contexts beyond ISD such as new product development, new technology adoption, \nand new technology development.  \nFrom a practical perspective, the study also provides insights and learning lessons for cities that are in \nthe process of planning and deployment their municipal wireless networks. It also offers more realistic \nexpectations around Wi-Fi deployment taking into consideration that the technology is not a plug and \nplay technology and that considerable efforts are needed to integrate the technology with other solutions \nto deliver broadband Internet services as well as to configure the system according to topologies, street \nconditions, buildings, density of trees, among others.    \n 27 \nReferences  \nAladwani, A.M.

ISD Events and Knowledge Activities: Chaska, MN \nISD EVENTS DESCRIPTION TIME LINE KNOWLEDGE ACTIVITES \nAssignment of personnel The IS department was assigned to \nresearch wireless broadband technology \nto blanket the entire city. \nJan. \u2013 Feb. \n2004 \nThe knowledge acquisition was done through \ntalking to vendors and following the industry. The \nIS department carefully evaluated the advantages \nand disadvantages of different wireless broadband \nproducts in the market. At the end, they concluded \nthat Wi-Fi mesh is the best choice with Tropos as a \npreferred vendor because Wi-Fi mesh is a non-\nproprietary system with relatively fast speed. \nHowever, some of their knowledge was developed \nby chance as stated by the former IS manager \u201cWe \nstumbled across Tropos web site, and we thought \nthey might be able to offer us something of value.\u201d  \nAssessment of performance:  \nOn-site testing of equipment \nThe city had a satisfactory on-site \ntesting of Tropos equipment and \ndetermined to move forward with this \nvendor.  \nMar. 2004 The IS manager stated \u201c[Tropos] came out \u2026 and \nleft us three of their nodes. We went out and built a \nkind of temporary network on the roof of a few of \nour vehicles, went out and tested the network.\u201d \nApproval of project The city council approved the wireless \nbroadband network. \nApr. 2004  \nSelection of specific vendor The city ordered 230 Tropos 5110 \nrouters. \nApr. 2004  \nPhysical system construction The city installed Tropos wireless \nrouters throughout the city area. \nMay \u2013 June \n2004 \nThe city applied the prior knowledge that it had as \na wireless operator to install the Wi-Fi mesh system \nin-house with some help in the planning and \ninstallation phases from First Mile Wireless, a \nreseller and integrator of wireless solutions and an \nauthorized reseller of Tropos.   \n \nThe IS manager stated \u201cAs a fixed wireless \noperator, we kept on thinking along the lines of \nhow high can we get those antennas to have a clear \nline of sight. But with a mesh system, that is not the \nright approach to take. Tropos recommended \nkeeping the nodes \u2026 around 15 to 20 feet off the \nground.\u201d \n 38 \nISD EVENTS DESCRIPTION TIME LINE KNOWLEDGE ACTIVITES \nAssessment of performance: \nInternal test of the network \nThe IS department successfully tested \nthe performance of the network. \nJune 2004 The IS manager stated \u201cWe have done testing \nindoors and outdoors. We are fairly confident it is \ngoing to work pretty well.
