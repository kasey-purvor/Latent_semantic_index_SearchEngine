Drawing on a series of \ngovernment publications, and reports at the level of schools, I argue that whilst health \neducation for children played an important role in a broader set of British national, \npolitical strategies to ensure the health and fitness of \u2018the Nation\u2019 during the twentieth \ncentury, it was girls who were the primary targets and recipients of health education \nin schools. Gender was thus central to the \u2018body work\u2019 in childhood that the official \npublications on health education sought to promote. \n \nBody, gender, health education, historical constructions of childhood \n 1 \nBody Work: Childhood, Gender and School Health Education in England and \nWales, 1870 to 1977  \n \nThe upsurge of sociological interest in bodies, and in particular, the development of \nembodiment perspectives, has encouraged an understanding of all bodies as unfinished, \ncorporeal-cultural entities (for example, Grosz 1994; Shilling 1993). It is, though, \nespecially the bodies of children that are constructed as bodies \u201ein progress\u201f. This makes \nchildhood a life course stage of intensive \u201ebody work\u201f, whether in a general sense of \nachieving a normatively \u201ehealthy\u201f rate of bodily growth during \u201egrowing up\u201f or, say, in \nrelation to the (re)production of gendered bodies (James, Jenks and Prout 1998: 164). \nThus conceptualised, \u201ebody work\u201f in childhood takes place within and through myriad \nsettings, processes and practices, including law and social policy (see, for example, \nPilcher and Wagg 1996, Author 1997, James and James 2004) and, as the new sociology \nof childhood reminds us, is undertaken not least by children themselves (Mayall 1996; \nJames and Prout 1997).  \n \nIn this paper, I consider one such arena of \u201ebody work\u201f within childhood: the formal \neducation of children in bodily health. This is a set of knowledge, practices and policies \narticulated \u201ein the name of the child\u201f (Cooter 1992) and in construction of childhood that \nhas been overlooked within historical and sociological analyses. I argue for the \nimportance of health education for school children in developing our understandings of \nthe constructions and reconstructions of childhood during the modern period, and also \npoint to the gendered character of these (re)constructions. Health education for children, \n 2 \nbased upon a view of children\u201fs bodies (and minds) as unfinished \u201eworks-in-progress\u201f \nwas a key way in which children, and notably girls, were constructed as pivotal actors in \nthe reproduction of the future social order in England and Wales during the twentieth \ncentury. I focus on the history of health education for school children from the inception \nof publicly funded education in England and Wales in 1870, through to the late 1970s \nwhen administrative restructuring shifted responsibility for the health of school children \naway from the government department of education to the department of health \n(Department of Education and Science 1977). My sources of evidence include a series of \ngovernment publications on health education for children, including guidance on the \ncurriculum in the various handbooks of health education (1928-1977) and official reports \nof health education provision at the level of schools contained within The Health of the \nSchoolchild (1907-1972). The various handbooks of health education, along with the \ndiscussions of health education policy and provision within the Health of the Schoolchild \nreports, were authored by senior civil servants and represented the \u201epractical translation \nof government policy into prescriptions for educational practice\u201f (Hunt 1991: 74). \nClearly, as such, these official publications cannot tell the whole story of what was said \nabout childhood and done to children (Hendrick 1992a) through the knowledge, practices \nand policies of health education in schools. The \u201enew\u201f approach to the study of childhood \n(James and Prout 1997) requires an understanding of children as active, reactive and \ncreative beings, and the official publications used in this article reveal very little about \nhow children themselves actively experienced the health education curriculum. Yet, as \nargued by Pilcher and Wagg (1996: 2), recognising that children actively shape the social \nworld must sit alongside an understanding of the ways their agency is framed and \n 3 \nconditioned by adult-dominated sets of knowledge, practices and policies (see also James \nand James 2004). Health education, including that for children, is inherently political in \nsubstance, despite its surface level neutrality and seemingly positive connotations \n(Lupton 1995; Green and Thorogood 1998). Health education in schools represents an \nimportant example of \u201ehow social policies\u2026engage with particular discourses of \nchildhood, respond to social events and embody specific ideological stances, combining \nto reproduce a particular form of childhood for children\u201f (James and James 2004: 9). In \nthis article, I show that particular gendered constructions of childhood underlay the \npolicy and practice of health education in schools during the period 1870-1977, which \nmeant that it was girls and their bodies, rather than boys and their bodies, who were the \nprimary targets and primary recipients of health education. Despite changes during the \ntwentieth century, both in constructions of gendered childhoods and in the school health \ncurriculum, including the gradual increase within it of the importance of sex education, \nofficial guidance on health education and local level provision in English and Welsh \nschools continued to construct feminine childhood as pivotal to securing the health of the \nnation.  \n \nThe origin and early development of health education in schools \nEducation in health (or \u201ehygiene\u201f) has been part of the curricula of publicly funded \nschools in England and Wales since at least the late nineteenth century and continues in \nthe present day (Board of Education 1930; Department For Education and Employment \n2000; Mayall 1996). The longevity of health education as a subject in schools is \nsuggestive of its importance, not least to successive British governments throughout the \n 4 \ntwentieth century and beyond. Yet, histories of public health notwithstanding (for \nexample, Armstrong 1983; 1993; Jones 1986; Lewis 1986), the history of health \neducation in England and Wales has been virtually ignored, with a few exceptions (Amos \n1993; Lupton 1995; Sutherland 1979; Welshman 1997); in particular, there is a lack of \nscholarly attention given to the history of health education in schools.  \n \nHistorical analyses of child health, welfare and education do, however, provide a broad \nframework within which to understand the development of health education for children. \nThe origin of social policy programmes related to children's health has generally been \nlocated by historians in the context of the widely held concerns about the poor living \nconditions, physical ill-health and doubtful morality of the large working-class \npopulation of nineteenth century urbanised, industrialised Britain (for example Fraser \n1984; Laybourn 1995). Such concerns were encapsulated in the Boer War (1899-1902) \nera anxieties about the future of the British Empire and of the \u201erace\u201f, given revelations \nabout its physically unfit male citizens, high rates of infant mortality, declining rates of \nfertility and incidence of venereal disease (see, for example, Bland 1982; Cooter 1992; \nMort 1987). It was in such contexts that, between the last decades of the nineteenth \ncentury and the early decades of the twentieth century, environmental discourses of \nhealth and disease (exemplified in the public sanitation campaigns of Edwin Chadwick) \nwere gradually replaced by discourses which targeted the individual as the key agent in \nthe maintenance of bodily health and the prevention of disease (Armstrong 1983; Mort \n1987; Welshman 1997). Although wide ranging in terms of its contributing elements \n(from bacteriology, to preventative medicine, to eugenicism), within these discourses \n 5 \nthere was a common emphasis on education in hygiene or health as the most effective \nstrategy through which to improve both the physical and sexual-moral health of \u201ethe \nNation\u201f (Mort 1987). During the early years of the twentieth century, it was working-\nclass children who emerged as a pre-eminent group of individuals through whose \nunfinished, and therefore malleable, bodies the future health and progress of the nation \nwould be secured (Cooter 1992; Hendrick 1997).  \n \nThe incorporation of the poorest children into the publicly funded schooling system, \nparticularly from 1870 onwards, meant that the condition of their bodily health became a \nmore pressing issue of political concern. As suggested by Mayall (1996), it became clear \nthat the unhealthy and poorly nourished bodies of working class children inhibited the \neducation of their minds. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, under the \ndirection of central government policy, provision developed within schools aimed at \nimproving the physical health of children, including school meals and programmes of \nmedical inspection (Hendrick 1997). Schemes of physical exercise had been part of the \nschool curriculum for boys and girls from the late nineteenth century onwards, in the \nform of \u201edrill\u201f (military- style marching) and, by the early twentieth century, included \nmore progressive forms such as dancing and gymnastics (Welshman 1998). As noted by \nWelshman (1998: 62), much of the appeal of physical education to the Board of \nEducation and other commentators lay in the belief that it inculcated an improved form of \ndisciplined physical citizenship, especially amongst boys.  \n \nAlongside these policy initiatives targeting children's bodies, there was also formal \n 6 \ninstruction for children in schools on matters of hygiene, so that both their minds and \nbodies might be educated in the practice of healthy living. The topics taught to working \nclass girls in the gendered curriculum of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries \nwere focused around efficient housewifery and competent motherhood, and as such were \nconcerned with the avoidance of malnutrition, ill-health and disease (Dyhouse 1981; \nHunt 1991; Purvis 1991; Turnbull 1987). But it was not until the early twentieth century \nthat health education was proposed as a compulsory subject in the curriculum for both \ntrainee teachers and school children (Dyhouse 1976). In a clear depiction of children\u201fs \nbodies as \u201eworks-in-progress\u201f toward a mature, adult, reproductive end-product, the \nBoard of Education insisted that   \n \n\u201fopportunity should be found in connection with the curriculum in elementary schools, \nfor imparting to the children who are to become mothers and fathers of the race, the \nbroad principles of healthy living\u201f (Board of Education 1905, cited in Dyhouse 1976: 49). \n \nThe establishment in 1908 of the School Medical Service marked a further key stage in \npolicy directed both at children's bodies and their minds, via its responsibilities for school \nmeals, medical inspections of children\u201fs bodies and physical and health education (Harris \n1995). It also represented a consolidation and expansion of the power and occupational \ninterests of those education and health professionals with a growing stake in the \ncultivation of \u201ehealthly\u201f children\u201fs bodies within school settings (Cooter 1992: Hendrick \n1992b; Turnbull 1987). \n \n 7 \nBy the mid-1920s, the Board of Education no longer overtly prescribed the curriculum as \nit had done previously (Hunt 1991; Simon 1974). In place of the earlier mandatory \nregulations and codes, instead were published \u201esuggestions\u201f as to what might be taught, \naccording to the level of school,  the age of pupils and on particular topics (for example, \nBoard of Education 1927a). Such guidance publications have been described as being, at \nleast during the period up until 1944, \u201ebibles\u201f for teachers, and in circumscribing practice, \nas having for them all the significance of a mandatory syllabus (Hunt 1991: 21). \nExamples include \u201esuggestions\u201f on the teaching of patriotism, on classics and, most \nimportantly for my purposes, the Handbook of Suggestions on Health Education (Board \nof Education 1928a). This was the most detailed official guidance on the teaching of \nhealth education in schools then published. In its preface, written by the then Chief \nMedical Officer to the Board of Education, George Newman, the handbook is described \nas part of the \u201enecessary equipment of every teacher\u201f (Board of Education 1928a: 3). A \n1929 survey of a sample of elementary schools found that 73% of junior mixed-sex \ndepartments or schools reported having at least one copy of the handbook of suggestions \non health education, rising to 74% of senior boys, and 81% of senior girls \ndepartments\/schools (Board of Education 1930). The distribution of the handbook was, \nthen, relatively widespread amongst publicly funded schools. This is a finding which, \ntogether with the publication of subsequent editions and various reprints between 1928 \nand 1947, points to the importance of health education in schools during the first part of \nthe twentieth century, in contrast to the view espoused by Sutherland (1979: 14). \n \n In his account of health education and public health, Welshman (1997) attributes the \n 8 \ngeneral expansion of health education to its cost effectiveness as a form of preventative \nmedicine, in the context of the economic recession of the 1920s and 1930s and associated \nfinancial retrenchment on health expenditure. It is clear from Newman's preface to the \n1928 handbook that part of the motivation for encouraging health education in schools \nwas economic. He notes, for example, that the neglect of hygiene and health \u201ecosts a \nnation dear, in money and life\u201f (1928a: 6). It is, though, the longer term anxieties over \nnational efficiency in the context of the decline of \u201ethe Nation\u201f in physical and moral \nterms that played the largest part in the development of health education in schools. \nMoreover, the view of children\u201fs bodies as unfinished entities made the life course stage \nof childhood the most worthy and effective one within which to invest health knowledge, \npractices and policy. In Newman's words, it is in childhood that \u201ecure\u201f and \u201econtrol\u201f are \nmost practicable and it was through children that would be laid \u201ethe foundations of a \nhealth conscience in the minds of the English people of the next generation\u201f  (1928a:12).  \nSchool health education thus represents an important aspect of the reconstructions of \nchildhood identified by Hendrick (1997) amongst others, whereby children through \nvarious social policies were attributed with a crucial status for the reproduction of the \nsocial order in late nineteenth and early-mid twentieth century Britain. However, as I go \non to show below, this reconstruction of childhood was not an ungendered one. Indeed, \nwe need to recognise not only reconstructions of childhood in terms of \u201eChildren of the \nNation\u201f (Hendrick 1997), but more specifically, of \u201eGirls of the Nation\u201f. \n 9 \nGendered childhoods in school health education up until the 1940s  \nAs noted above, in the early editions of the handbooks of health education, hygiene \neducation for children was emphasised as a key means of improving \u201enational efficiency\u201f, \nthrough raising levels of physical health amongst the future adult population. The \nsuggested syllabus included (in the 1928 edition), cleanliness and care of the body, \nclothing, fresh air and sunlight, eating habits, communicable diseases, and science. In the \ntwo subsequent editions (1933 and 1939), the contents were expanded to include \u201ethe \nhygiene of food and drink\u201f, \u201emothercraft and infant care\u201f and the \u201econditions of a healthy \nenvironment\u201f. A significant element of health education proposed for children was \npredicated on the intense surveillance and regulation of their unfinished bodies. \nEspecially in the early editions of the handbooks, teachers were exhorted to scrutinise and \nregulate the bodies of their pupils, through for example, monitoring their bodily \ncleanliness, instructing them in the frequency of changing underclothes and of making \nbowel movements, and in the proper use of handkerchiefs (Board of Education 1928a: 9, \n10, 14). Thus, although health education for children reflected the construction of them as \nadults of the future, this was predicated upon a close scrutiny of their childish bodies in \nthe \u201ehere and now\u201f of their present.  \n \nThe topic of mothercraft notwithstanding, the advisory discourses of the handbooks \nconstructed the bodies of children as \u201eunsexed\u201f: there is a conspicuous absence of any \ndiscussion of the human sexual and reproductive body, despite virtually every other \nbodily system and function being suggested as potentially suitable topics for the health \neducation curriculum within schools (Author 2004). Yet, within the early editions of the \n 10 \nhandbook of health education, it is nonetheless evident that the sex of the child to be \neducated in health was most often assumed to be male. Generic use is made of the \nmasculine pronoun throughout the handbooks. In itself, this might be argued to reflect the \npatriarchal linguistic practices of the era. However, the assumption of the health \neducation pupil as a masculine adult-in-waiting is apparent in the following passage, \nwhere a link is made between health education and adult, masculine citizenship:  \n \nAny teaching of citizenship to older children resolves itself in a large degree into health \neducation. The first duty of the citizen to the State is to make himself a strong, long-lived, \ncapable citizen, able to work and produce, the guardian and maintainer of a home, an all-\nround man, loyal, patriotic, a \u201cfriend and helper of mankind\u201d  (Board of Education \n1928a: 75-6; see also Board of Education 1933: 66).  \n \nElsewhere in the handbooks, assumptions made about the \u201enatural differences\u201f between \ngirls and boys and their future differentiated roles in adulthood meant that both sexes \nwere sometimes addressed. For example, in passages discussing the importance of a \n\u201ehealthy mind\u201f, teachers are advised to encourage the interest of boys and girls separately \nthrough attending to the gender distinct \u201esprings of action\u201f that each possess. In girls, \nthese are said to be \u201ethe desire for happiness and usefulness\u201f; in boys, the desire for \u201erisk, \nadventure, fame and service\u201f (1933: 17; see also 1928a: 58).  Gendered assumptions \nabout the present and future interests of boys and girls are further reflected in suggestions \nabout where in the curriculum health might be taught. Thus, in the 1928 edition of the \nhandbook, it is suggested that teaching about nutrition should be undertaken for girls in \n 11 \ntheir \u201ehousecraft\u201f lessons, and for boys in science lessons (1928a: 28). Similarly, whilst \naspects of health education could be covered under the history or geography curriculum, \n\u201ein the case of girls much of the instruction will naturally form part of the teaching of \ndomestic subjects and housecraft\u201f (1928a: 11), since as stated later in the handbook, \n\u201edomestic training is essentially a form of health education\u201f (1928a: 76).  These excerpts \nprovide a clear illustration of the ways in which domestic training was regarded as \nvirtually equivalent to health education, thus making girls and their bodies its \u201enatural\u201f \npupils. \n \nIn these ways, then, although the health education pupil was implicitly assumed to be \nmale (through language and illustrative examples), the equation of health education with \ndomestic training brought the practical focus of the health education curriculum very \nmuch on to girls. The Chief Medical Officer to the Board of Education included in his \nannual report of 1928 a chapter which, through emphasising the importance of instructing \ngirls in the 'foundations of motherhood' as a key part of their education in health, shows \nthe construction of feminine childhood in terms of future housewives and mothers. Thus, \nit was argued that the 'source and strength of a people depends primarily on motherhood. \nIf the school girls of this generation are to become the wise mothers of the next, they \nmust be taught the elements of Mothercraft'. Further, 'no schooling of a girl can be \nsatisfactory which fails to aid in her equipment for this supreme task' (Board of \nEducation 1928b: 82, 88).  Thus, by the second edition of the handbook of health \neducation, published in 1933, the contents had been amended to incorporate the 1910 \n 12 \nmemorandum on the teaching of mothercraft and infant care, along with a 1920 \nmemorandum on the hygiene of food and drink.  \n \nFor boys, a key part of health education was said to be physical training, games and team \nwork in order that their bodies acquired 'strength and skill for manual labour' (1928b: 82), \nin preparation for their adult futures in paid employment as the mainstay of the nation\u201fs \nworkforce. Notably, however, the various editions of the handbook never incorporated a \nsyllabus on physical training, published in 1919. Moreover, within the annual reports of \nthe Chief Medical Officer to the Board of Education, physical education was invariably \ndiscussed under its own separate heading, rather than within sections or chapters on \nhealth education. Thus, physical education remained related to but separate from health \neducation, unlike those aspects of the curriculum targeted especially at girls.  \n \nThe closeness of the link between femininity and health education for children was \napparently not a wholly desirable state of affairs, at least from the point of view of the \nChief Medical Officer to the Board of Education. As early as 1925, George Newman was \nbemoaning the limited provision of health education for boys in schools: \n \n 'The teaching of hygiene to boys is on a  much less satisfactory basis, owing to the fact \nthat there is no practical school course corresponding to the domestic science work of the \ngirls' (Board of Education 1925: 113).  \n \nNewman went on to extol the virtues of the 'spirit and methods' of the Boy Scout \n 13 \nmovement (associated with Baden Powell), as a model of health education for boys via \nits emphasis on activities of one kind or another (1925: 114). The 'comparatively \nbackward state' of health education for boys compared to girls (Board of Education 1925: \n112) was not, however, resolved to Newman\u201fs satisfaction some several years later \n(Board of Education 1930: 47). A survey of school health education undertaken by \nschools medical officers in 1929 showed the marked levels of gender disparity in the \nteaching of health education. Six per cent of the senior girls departments or schools in the \nsurvey were reported to offer no systematic course in hygiene, compared to 32 per cent of \nsenior boys departments or schools. Provision for both genders was found to be much \nlower amongst the more middle-class, academically orientated secondary schools, but \neven here the proportion of girls departments or schools reported to offer no systematic \ncourse on hygiene (45 per cent) was significantly less than that for boys, at 85 per cent \n(Board of Education 1930). A further study, undertaken a decade later, suggested much \nthe same gendered pattern of health education provision within schools. In 1943, a survey \non the extent and character of sex education undertaken by His Majesty's Inspectors of \nEducation reported that \u201every much more attention is given to this subject in girls' schools \nthan in boys' schools\u201f, at the ratio of three to one (Ministry of Education 1943: 6, 12). \nArguably, such a gendered disparity reflected a tendency within schools to equate both \nsex education and health education with instruction to girls about their present and future \nbodies, via topics such as menstruation and related personal hygiene, and mothercraft and \ninfant care.  \n \n 14 \nThe annual reports of the Chief Medical Officer to the Board of Education (later the \nMinistry of Education, and Department of Education and Science), often referred to as \nthe Health of the Schoolchild reports are an important source of evidence about the extent \nand character of health education for children within schools during the twentieth century \nand its contribution to the (re)construction of gendered childhoods. Published between \n1907 and 1972, these reports include summaries of submissions made by county and city \nschool medical officers to the government department of education, as well as policy \nstatements emphasising the ongoing importance of health education in schools. Yet, \ndespite the official rhetoric as to the central importance of health education for children \nper se, and concerns expressed at the highest level about the limitations of health \neducation for boys, what the reports reveal is the extent to which local provision \nremained gendered throughout the period, with girls and their bodies as its primary \nrecipients.  \n \nIn the reports of local level programmes of health education within schools, more often \nthan not, the examples given are of schemes within girls' schools or of schemes involving \nonly girls within mixed sex schools. In the report for 1913, for example, an extended \nillustration is given of a scheme of health education as \u201epractice rather than theory\u201f. \nOperated by a girls\u201f school in Greenwich, London, this scheme included the topics of \nmother craft and infant care, first aid and nursing, and household cleaning (Board of \nEducation 1914: 237). Similarly, the example of the \u201eHealth Brigade\u201f within \nBirmingham\u201fs elementary schools detailed in the report for 1922, appears not only to \nhave been the initiative and responsibility of women science teachers but also to have had \n 15 \nonly girl pupils as its members (Board of Education 1923: 28). The tendency for the \nexamples of programmes of health education given in the official publications to be about \ngirls' schools, women teachers and girl pupils underlines the extent to which women and \ngirls have been central to health education. This reflects both the gendered mapping of \nthe mind\/body dualism, within which girls and women are constructed as closer to \n\u201enature\u201f via their bodily functions, and relatedly, their status as \u201ethe socially constructed \npivot of family health and welfare\u201f (Rodmell and Watt 1986: 10; see also Nettleton \n1991;Welshman 1987). Important in this regard is the previously noted equation, \nespecially at the local level of schools, of \u201ehealth education\u201f with topics such as domestic \nscience, mothercraft and infant care, and menstruation. Within the Health of the \nSchoolchild reports, there are over the years numerous examples given of house craft, \nfirst aid, and infant care orientated health education programmes for girls. These operated \nacross the country, from Plymouth to Bradford (Board of Education 1924), from \nBirkenhead to Yorkshire (Ministry of Education 1947), from Leeds to Kidderminster, to \nBrighton (Ministry of Education 1960), from Devon to Croydon (Ministry of Education \n1964). On occasion in the reports, the sex of the pupils involved in health education \nschemes described therein remains unclear and details of the syllabus of such schemes \nare provided only in general terms. It is therefore not always possible to interpret the \nextent of gendering of health education from the descriptions given. Even more rarely, \nthough, are specific details provided about health education programmes targeted at boys. \nThe case of a \u201eHandyman\u201f course for boys in an Essex elementary school is an exception \nthat rather proves the rule. Here the course centred around domestic repairs, included \nwoodwork and the proper care of chimneys and was therefore compared with domestic \n 16 \nscience courses for girls (Board of Education 1925: 114).  \n \nBody work for boys? Bringing boys in to health education \nAs Hunt (1987) reminds us, despite its longstanding place in the curriculum, it is \nimportant to note the wide variations between schools in the provision of domestic \ntraining for girls. There is also evidence of resistance to it being taught, from parents, \npupils and teachers themselves (Dyhouse 1976; Turnbull 1987). Such resistance can also \nbe interpreted as a reluctance to accept the (re)construction of feminine childhoods, and \nby implication, future adulthoods, that such gendered programmes of education \nrepresented. The contentious nature of domestic training was certainly alluded to in \nseveral editions of the handbooks of health education (for example, Ministry of \nEducation 1956: 51-2; Department of Education and Science 1968: 94). Nevertheless, it \nwas perhaps in response to the secure place of domestic science, mother craft and infant \ncare in the school curriculum, relative to similarly orientated courses for boys, that \nofficial policy discourses increasingly began to encourage the inclusion of boys in this \ntype of health education. Moreover, such courses were activity-based, and thus seen as \nmore likely to secure the interest of boys. As early as 1925, the Chief Medical Officer to \nthe Board of Education was referring to the \u201ejoint responsibility\u201f of boys as \u201ehomemakers \nof the future\u201f (Board of Education 1925: 115). This viewpoint was reiterated in the 1928 \nedition of the handbook of health education when, in a discussion of training in \n\u201eHandwork and Domestic Subjects\u201f, it was stated that \u201eopportunities may\u2026. be found for \ninstruction in the carrying out of simple household occupations, in which boys also \nshould take their part\u201f (Board of Education 1928a: 77). Likewise, in the Chief Medical \n 17 \nOfficer\u201fs (now Arthur MacNalty, appointed 1935) report for the years 1939-1945, it was \nargued that \u201eboys and girls should be expected to take part in domestic work\u201f and that \nboys should be taught to expect to \u201eshare equally in the responsibility of home making\u201f \n(Ministry of Education 1947: 128). It was, though, especially in the post- Second World \nWar period, in the context of emerging trends in adult \u201econjugal relationships\u201f \ndocumented in the 1950s by Bott (1971) and in the 1960s by Young and Willmott (1975), \nthat official discourses on health education for schoolchildren began to be both more \ninclusive of girls, in terms of the use of language, and of boys, in terms of the need for \ntheir instruction in those health education topics traditionally seen as the preserve of girls \narising from their anticipated future adult lives as wives and mothers.   \n \nGendered childhoods in school health education post-1945: the troublesome bodies \nof girls \nThe first post-Second World War revised edition of the handbook of health education \nwas published in 1956. One significant alteration to the content of the handbook was the \nomission of the chapter, present in the 1933 and 1939 editions, on \u201eMothercraft and \nInfant care\u201f. The topic was now incorporated, in a much briefer form, within a new \nchapter (also present in the later 1968 edition) entitled \u201eSchool and the Future Parent\u201f. \nHere, the concern to encourage the instruction of boys as well as girls in the proper care \nof infants and children, in anticipation of their becoming fathers of the future, is clearly \nexpressed through the use of the term \u201eparentcraft\u201f (Ministry of Education 1956: 53; \nDepartment of Education and Science 1968: 94), alongside that of \u201emothercraft\u201f \n(Ministry of Education 1956: 51; Department of Education and Science 1968: 93) and \n 18 \nthrough frequent references to both sexes in this context.  Earlier in the 1956 edition of \nthe handbook, during a discussion of the range of subjects within secondary schools \nwhere health education could be taught, reference was made to \u201eHousecraft\u201f and the need \nto include boys in it: \n \n \u201eThis is traditionally a subject for girls, yet boys too could benefit from some preliminary \ntraining in the domestic skills which a wife may now reasonably expect of her husband; \nefficiency, cleanliness (particularly in handling food), and proper standards of taste in \ndomestic matters are as important for boys as girls\u201f (Ministry of Education 1956: 46).  \n \n In the 1968 edition of the handbook of health education, this section is re-titled \u201eHome \nEconomics\u201f and reference is again made to \u201ehome-making as a joint responsibility of the \nfather and the mother\u201f so that \u201eboys should have an opportunity to join in some of the \nhome economics teaching\u201f (Department of Education and Science 1968: 88). Moreover, \nin a chapter on nutrition and food, the importance of teaching both boys and girls about \nnutrition is emphasised (Department of Education and Science 1968: 51). These \nexamples suggest the ways in which official guidance discourses on health education in \nschools sought to encourage the inclusion of boys in the longer and more securely \nestablished elements of the health education curriculum, traditionally provided for girls, \nin reflection of a reconstruction of masculine childhood which incorporated future adult \ndomestic and child care responsibilities. Nevertheless, within the chapter on school and \nthe future parent, much of the discussion (within both the 1956 and 1968 editions) is \nactually about \u201emothercraft\u201f and the pros and cons of instructing girls in \u201ebody work\u201f \n 19 \nrelated topics such as infant care, cookery, cleanliness, laundry and sewing along with \nhousehold budgeting (Ministry of Education 1956: 51-53; Department of Education and \nScience 1968: 88-9). Moreover, there is still a notable tendency within the 1956 and 1968 \neditions of the handbook to rely upon the generic masculine pronoun. In illustrative \nexamples, too, the \u201ehealth-education-pupil-as-male\u201f assumption remains apparent. Thus, \nin a discussion of alcohol in relation to health, references are made to the need to \u201edispel \nthe illusion that in the world outside school abstinence is somehow unmanly\u201f (Ministry of \nEducation 1956: 112). Mention is made of athletes in training who avoid alcohol, and the \nexamples given here are those masculine sports of boxing, mountaineering and football \n(Ministry of Education 1956: 112).  \n \nYet,  and in keeping with the tendency (noted earlier) within official discourses of health \neducation to problematise girls' future embodied adult roles as wives and mothers, it was \ngirls' bodies rather than boys' bodies that are given special mention within the 1956 \nchapter on sex education. Any discussion of the sexual and reproductive human body had \nbeen conspicuous by its absence in previous editions of the handbook (Author 2004). \nYet, once the sexual and reproductive body had gained a place within official advisory \ndiscourses, it was the \u201especial difficulties\u201f faced by girls at puberty that is specified as a \ntopic about which girls should be instructed within health education (Ministry of \nEducation 1956: 58). Those faced by boys at puberty do not gain mention at all. In an \nearlier advisory publication on sex education (Ministry of Education 1943), the bodies of \ngirls were similarly problematised in a discussion of the growing \u201elaxity of morals\u201f under \nwartime conditions and the consequent need for more sex education in schools. It was \n 20 \nnoted that \u201eyoung girls\u201f in \u201econsiderable numbers\u201f are the \u201evictims of indiscriminate \nassociations\u201f, resulting in an increasing incidence among them of venereal disease \n(Ministry of Education 1943: 4). Likewise, in the 1968 edition of the handbook of health \neducation the topic of alcohol is argued to be important because of the \u201eoccasions when \ngirls whose knowledge of alcohol is inadequate become drunk at parties and allow sexual \nintercourse to take place\u201f (Department of Education and Science 1968: 139). In neither \nthe 1943 nor the 1968 publication is boys\u201f sexuality problematised in such a manner. \nThis construction of girls\u201f bodies as troublesome is in keeping with similar tendencies \nnoted to be evident elsewhere, including in educational psychology where feminine \npuberty and adolescence more generally were regarded as handicapping girls\u201f physical \nand intellectual capacities (Dyhouse 1976; Hunt 1991; Mort 1987; see also Board of \nEducation 1923a). It was not until the 1968 publication of the handbook of health \neducation that boys\u201f experiences of puberty gain mention alongside those of girls. In \naddition to emphasising the importance of educating girls about the bodily changes of \npuberty (Ministry of Education 1956: 58), it was now proposed that \u201efurther information\u201f \nwas also required by pubescent boys. Just as unprepared girls might be shocked by the \nonset of menstruation, for a boy to experience \u201eseminal emission\u201f unprepared was a cause \nof \u201emuch distress\u201f (Department of Education and Science 1968: 99).  \n \nA sixth and last edition of the handbook of health education was published in 1977. Now \nentitled Health Education in Schools, the style of the publication was more academic and \nscientific than its predecessors, with references to learned journals and tables of statistical \ndata. In fact, the 1977 edition bears very little resemblance, in content or style, to the \n 21 \nearlier editions: it had been almost wholly rewritten. At the outset of the 1977 edition of \nthe handbook, and indeed throughout, the language used is inclusive of girls, with a \nlimited reliance on the generic masculine pronoun and \u201eboys and girls\u201f (although \ninvariably in that order) a phrase routinely employed. The long-present encouragement \nwithin the handbooks for teachers to enact, in the name of health education, a culture of \nsurveillance of children\u201fs bodily cleanliness, including the frequency of bowel \nmovements and so on, had now fully disappeared. Previously, health education \ndiscourses had constructed the bodies of working class children as deficient in and of \nthemselves, and as such were regarded as a threat to the health of future adult \npopulations. A shift in concern away from \u201ehygiene\u201f and toward the promotion of healthy \nlife-styles via the avoidance of \u201einadvisable\u201f behaviour (Green and Thorogood 1998; \nRodmell and Watt 1986) is indicated by new chapters on communicable diseases, \npollution, occupational health, accidents, drugs, alcohol and smoking, and most notably, \nsex. For the first time in the handbooks, there was a specific chapter entitled \u201eSex \nEducation\u201f and the education of both sexes in each other's experiences of puberty was \nsuggested as a topic for health education in schools: \n \n \u201eBoys in particular should come to realise that for girls there are times connected with \nmenstrual periods or episodes in their emotional development when they may be \ndistressed or tired through no fault of their own and that both should realise that the \nemission of semen is abundant, and sometimes uncontrollable\u201f (Department of Education \nand Science 1977: 116).  \n \n 22 \nThis passage clearly reflects a shift in the view of children and gives recognition to their \nneed to know about their sexual and reproductive bodies in the \u201ehere and now\u201f of their \npresent. Yet, the extract also shows the longstanding tendency within health education \npolicy to especially problematise embodied femininity and to place upon it a burden of \nresponsibility: here, for boys and men\u201fs sexual behaviour. In a further example, it was \nsaid that girls  \n \n\u201eshould also understand that they may quite inadvertently impose great stress on boys by \narousing sexual reactions in them which they do not fully comprehend and may not be \nable to control\u201f (Department of Education and Science 1977: 117).  \n \nLater, during a discussion on the topic of contraception within the health education \ncurriculum, it is claimed that girls \u201esaying no\u201f is both by far the most widely used and \nmost certain means of avoiding an unwanted pregnancy (Department of Education and \nScience 1977: 117). Clearly, then, although mothercraft and infant care no longer \nwarranted discussion in the handbook as a suggested curriculum topic, the \u201etroublesome \nbodies\u201f (Smart 1995) of girls remained a primary concern with official guidance \ndiscourses on health education within schools and, relatedly, within the construction and \nreconstruction of gendered childhoods.  \n \nThe inclusion of sex as a suggested topic within the health education curriculum from the \n1956 and onwards editions of the handbooks can, nonetheless, be interpreted as a \nprogressive development, signalling the end of a long period of fence-sitting on the place \n 23 \nof sex within the health education curriculum (Author 2004). It suggests a reconstruction \nof childhood that, finally, incorporated a recognition of children\u201fs bodies as being sexual \nand reproductive, both in their here and now and as adult works-in-progress. By the mid-\n1960s, in the context of changing post-war sexual cultures (Hall 2000; Porter and Teich \n1994), sex had apparently secured such a firm place in the curriculum that concerns were \nexpressed that health education for children was increasingly becoming largely about sex \n(Department of Education and Science 1966: 83). Yet, the dominant construction of sex \neducation within the guidance on the health curriculum for children remained bodily-\nfocused \u201eeducation in preventative medicine\u201f (the avoidance of sexually transmitted \ndiseases and pre-marital and extra-marital pregnancy), as well as gendered socialisation \n(into adult normative, embodied sexual identities and morality, specifically patriarchal \nheterosexuality in the context of marriage and parenthood). As shown above, the shifting \ncontent of the health education curriculum, and in particular, the increasing prominence \nwithin it of sex, did not mean the end of the tendency to construct girls and their \nproblematic bodies as the primary recipients of health education in schools as a \nconsequence of their status as female adults of the future. Indeed as studies of the modern \nhistory and contemporary politics of sex education in schools have suggested, the \nreproductive bias of much of what has been defined as \u201esex education\u201f has meant that it \nhas been girls rather than boys who have been its main pupils (for example, Durham \n1992; Lewis and Knijn 2002; Kehily 2002; Monk 2001; Author 2004; Author, \nforthcoming; Thomson 1994). \n \n 24 \nConclusions \nThe sexual and reproductive human body may have been absent from official guidance \ndiscourses on school health education for much of the period 1870-1977, but as I have \nargued in this paper, embodied constructions of gendered childhoods were none the less \ncentral to their articulation. Through the handbooks of health education and through the \npublication of reports of local provision contained within the Health of the Schoolchild, \ncentral administrative government authorities promoted health education for children as a \nkey means of gendering children's bodies and minds according to the perceived needs of \ntwentieth-century capitalist, imperial and patriarchal English society. In the case of \nworking class boys, the guidance publications on health education for school children \npromoted knowledge, culture and practices which sought to construct their bodies and \nminds through, for examples, programmes of physical education and instruction in \ntechnical, manual skills in reflection of their future adult roles in the paid workforce. In \nthe case of girls, health education converged in important respects with the gendered \ncurriculum as this had developed for girls from the late nineteenth century onwards, \nwithin which housewifery, mothercraft, infant care and menstruation-related personal \nhygiene were important. Girls were therefore an especially important focus of the \u201ebody \nwork\u201f, the finishing of children\u201fs bodies (and minds), that health education in schools \nrepresented. At least up until the 1970s, the concept of health underlying the suggested \nhealth education curriculum for schools was, therefore, that of \u201efunctional-efficiency\u201f \n(Blaxter 2004). In other words, health as the ability to effectively perform social roles, \nespecially, in the case of children, future, gendered, adult roles. Consequently, within the \nhandbooks, guidance discourses were not \u201egender-neutral\u201f but instead reproduced \n 25 \nparticular constructions of gendered childhoods, within which girls were attributed with \nan especial burden of responsibility for the health, welfare and later, also the sexual \nbehaviour, of others, whether in their present or in their prescribed future roles as wives \nand mothers. Aspects of the construction of childhood within the handbooks may be \nregarded as \u201eprogressive\u201f; for example, in relation to the promotion of the idea that boys \ntoo had some future household and parental responsibilities. Nonetheless, it was feminine \nchildhood not masculine childhood that remained the socially constructed embodiment of \nresponsibility for the present and future avoidance of dirt, disease, malnutrition, ill-health \nand immorality. Thus, gender was central to the \u201ebody work\u201f in childhood that the official \nguidance publications on health education in schools sought to promote.  \n \nThe official publication sources drawn upon in this article show that gender was central \nto what was said about childhood and what was done to children (Hendrick 1992a) within \nearly to mid-twentieth century health and welfare knowledges, practices and policies. \nNevertheless, such sources have their limitations, not least the absence of children\u201fs own \nvoices and perspectives within them. Moreover, despite being published by successive \ngovernment boards, ministries or departments of education, and with prefaces by Chief \nMedical Officers, and even though teachers may have placed great store by them as \nargued by Felicity Hunt and others, the handbooks of health education remained advisory \nrather than mandatory (Hunt 1991), and their distribution amongst schools was never by \nany means complete (for example Board of Education 1930). Further, individual head \nteachers continued to retain responsibility for and broad control over what got taught in \ntheir schools, right up until the 1980s (Flude and Hammer 1990). Within the Health of \n 26 \nthe Schoolchild reports, some resistance to the provision of health education in schools \nwas alluded to, via mention of crowded timetables, resource and staffing issues (for \nexample, Board of Education 1925: 116; Board of Education 1927b: 75; Board of \nEducation 1930: 39). Especially during the later period, other discourses of health \neducation were available and had a presence in schools, for example, via the Health \nEducation Council. More broadly, the role played by health education for children in \nachieving its objectives, both published and unpublished, should not be overstated. For \nexample, improved standards of health characteristic of twentieth-century Britain were \nlargely the consequence of structural changes, of increases in standards of living and \nrelative levels of affluence for example, rather than solely the direct result of health \neducation's efficacy in regulating children\u201fs bodies, especially working class feminine \nbodies, to be less physically deficient and morally troublesome. Further, as I have argued \nelsewhere (Author 2004, 2005), shifts in the health education curriculum and in the \nconstruction of childhood it (re)produced were, in important ways, brought about by the \nagency (both presumed and actual) of children and young people themselves, for \nexample, via their participation in the youth cultures of the post-war decades, their sexual \nmorality and their consumption of drugs. In the light of these issues, further research is \nrequired on the interpretation, implementation and experiences at the local level of \nofficial guidance on the health education curriculum for children. Such research, in \npointing to the ways social and educational policies, rather than being determinate \nstructures, operate as powerful ideological resources, drawn upon and\/or rejected in \nsocial interaction, would deepen understanding of the range of ways official guidance on \nhealth education contributed to the gendered construction and reconstruction of childhood \n 27 \nthat was the experience of numerous cohorts of children during the modern era.  \n \nBibliography \nAmos, A.
