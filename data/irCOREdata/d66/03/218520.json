One of the key dif-\nferences among systems concerns the extent to \nwhich such decisions are made by career central \nbankers (insiders) or those outside the central \nbanking fraternity (outsiders). Some countries \noperate at one extreme on this spectrum, with \nclose control by either central bank insiders or \ndecisions made by politicians. But many locate \nsomewhere in the middle.\nA case in point is the Bank of England \nMonetary Policy Committee (MPC), which is \nstudied here. Decisions are delegated to a com-\nmittee comprising five internal members, who \nhave full-time executive positions in the Bank, \nand four external members who work mostly \npart time and have no executive responsibili-\nties. Each month, all members of the commit-\ntee are briefed by Bank of England staff, after \nwhich they meet for a private discussion and \nsubsequently vote on interest rate decisions. The \noutcome is determined by majority rule and the \nvotes are subsequently made public.\nExpErtisE and MacroEconoMic policy \u2020\nInsiders versus Outsiders in Monetary Policymaking\nBy Timothy Besley, Neil Meads, and Paolo Surico*\nThere are two reasons why the composition \nof monetary policy committees could matter for \npolicy. The first is due to the process for selec-\ntion of its members\u2014those who come up as \ninsiders have different backgrounds and skills. \nIn the case of the Bank of England, appointment \nto the position is also formally different for the \ninternal and external members. The second is \ndue to member incentives. External members \nleave the committee after their terms, while the \ninternal members may be building their careers \nin central banking. If career concerns affect \nincentives, we would expect this to play out \nquite differently for each group.\nThis paper looks at the voting patterns of \ninternal and external members of the MPC \nto investigate how great are the differences \nbetween insiders and outsiders. We make three \ncontributions. First, we assess the extent to \nwhich the Bank of England\u2019s internally gener-\nated forecasts explain the MPC members\u2019 vot-\ning decisions. This is important, as generating \nforecasts on a quarterly basis is a key part of the \nprocess used by the Bank of England. The fore-\ncast for inflation is made public in the Inflation \nReport, while the output gap forecast is not. \nSecond, we use a random coefficient method of \nestimation in which the parameters of the inter-\nest rate rule are allowed, but not required, to dif-\nfer across members. Third, we find evidence of \nsome heterogeneity in the intercept, a measure \nof experience on the MPC and the interest rate \nsmoothing parameter, but no significant differ-\nences in the members\u2019 reaction to the forecasts \nof inflation and output gaps.\nOur paper is related to a growing empiri-\ncal literature covering the voting record of the \nMPC. Petra Gerlach-Kristen (2003, 2007), \nArnab Bhattacharjee and Sean Holly (2006), and \nChristopher Spencer (2006a) assess the extent \nof dissent among members.

Charlotta Groth and \nTracy Wheeler (2008) contrast the frequency \nof policy changes at individual and committee \nlevels. Simon Hix, Bjorn Hoyland, and Nick \nVivyan (2007) investigate the link between \ngovernment spending and MPC appointments. \nCharles Goodhart (2005) estimates aggregate \nreaction functions for the MPC as a whole.\nIn recent studies, Spencer (2006b) and \nAlessandro Riboni and Francisco Ruge-Murcia \n(2007) offer analyses most similar in spirit to \nthose of our paper, estimating individual reac-\ntion functions. There are important differences, \nhowever, in our approach, including the use of \nthe Bank of England inflation and output gaps \nforecast and the random coefficient estima-\ntion method, which explicitly recognizes the \ndynamic nature of the panel of the MPC voting \nrecord.\nI.\u2002 Specifications\u2002and\u2002Results\nThis section presents the specifications and \nthe estimates of aggregate and individual inter-\nest rate rules.\nA. Pooled versus Individual Policy Rules\nThe rule proposed by John B. Taylor (1993) \npostulates that the policy rate responds to devia-\ntions of inflation and output from the inflation \ntarget and the potential output. The policy rules \nemployed in the empirical literature are typi-\ncally variations of the simple formulation by \nTaylor.\nIn line with the current practice in monetary \npolicymaking, the central bank tries to close \nthe gap between targets and targeted variables. \nPolicy is typically forward looking in that fore-\ncasts rather than current values matter for the \ninterest rate decision. Consistent with earlier \ncontributions, the movement in the policy rate \nnecessary to close the gap is assumed to be \ngradual, in the form of sequences of small steps \nin the same direction. Thus, we allow for inter-\nest rate smoothing by introducing the lagged \ninterest rate as a regressor.\nThis treatment of interest rate smoothing is \npartly a semantic issue, and merely reflects an \nempirical regularity still in search of a defini-\ntive explanation. One view is that the lagged \ndependent variable reflects learning about the \nevolution of unobserved states, such as, for \ninstance, the natural rate of interest.1 Other, not \nmutually exclusive, views include that interest \nrate smoothing captures the Brainard principle \nof caution in the face of uncertainty about the \nstructure of the economy or serial correlation in \nthe error terms.\nIn the context of dynamic heterogeneous \n panels, Hashem M. Pesaran and Ron Smith \n(1995) show that when coefficients differ across \ngroups, the estimates of long-run relationships \ncan be severely biased if the regressors are \nhighly persistent, as they are in our dataset.2 In \nparticular, the coefficient on the lagged depen-\ndent variable is biased toward one, while the \nshort-run coefficients of the other variables are \nbiased toward zero.\nA typical aggregate Taylor rule takes the fol-\nlowing form:\n(1)  it 5 a 1 bEt21 5pt1h 2 p*6\n 1 gEt21 5xt1k6 1 rit21 1 et ,\nwhere the policy instrument, it , is a short-term \ninterest rate, 1pt 2 p*2 and xt represent devia-\ntions of inflation and output from their reference \nvalues; and h and k denote the relevant fore-\ncast horizons for inflation and the output gap, \nrespectively.\nBefore proceeding, a word of caution is \nneeded on the interpretation of our estimates. \nIt is not suggested that monetary policy in the \nUnited Kingdom or any other country is, in fact, \nconducted by reference to such rules. Rather, \naggregate and individual versions of (1) are sim-\nply a convenient representation of movements in \nthe short-term interest rate.\nAs we are interested in individual heteroge-\nneity, a more flexible alternative to the aggregate \nTaylor rule is a reaction function where param-\neters are allowed to vary across MPC members. \nIf only the intercept changes with the N MPC \nmembers, then we have a Fixed Effect (FE) \n1 As different members may have different views on the \nstate of the economy, the unobserved variable rationale for \ninterest rate smoothing corroborates the use of heteroge-\nneous policy rules.\n2 The sum of the autoregressive parameters in an AR(p) \nprocess, a widely used measure of persistence, is 0.83 for \nthe inflation forecast and 0.86 for the output gap forecast, \nwith p 5 6.\nMAy 2008220 AEA PAPERs AND PROcEEDINgs\nmodel which, with a slight abuse of notation, we \nwrite as follows:\n(2)  ij, t 5 aj 1 bEt21 5pt1h 2 p*6\n 1 gEt21 5xt1k6 1 rit21 1 ej, t ,\nwith j 5 1, \u2026 , N. If the inflation and the output \ngap slopes are also member specific, then we have \nthe Random Coefficient (RC) specification:\n(3)  ij, t 5 aj 1 bj Et21 5pt1h 2 p*6\n 1 gj Et21 5xt1k6 1 rj it21 1 hj, t .\nIn the remainder of the paper, we assess the \nability of individual reaction functions to cap-\nture heterogeneity in the voting patterns of MPC \nmembers.3\nB. Estimates\nIn Table 1, we report estimates of the three \nspecifications using the Bank of England\u2019s fore-\ncasts for inflation and output gaps. The forecasts \nare based on the constant interest rate projec-\ntions reported in the Inflation Report, a quar-\nterly publication issued by the Bank of England \naround the middle of each February, May, \nAugust, and November.\u0004 We prefer to use con-\nstant, as opposed to market-based, interest rates \nbecause the former are not influenced by the \nprivate sector expectations on the future path of \npolicy rates.\nThe parameters h and k are set, respectively, to \n2\u0004 and 12 months. A two-year horizon for infla-\ntion is often referred to in the Inflation Report. \nAnd, a one-year horizon for output is consistent \nwith the extensive VAR evidence on the lags of \n3 Although the specification is fairly general in the way it \nallows for heterogeneity between committee members, we \nassume that the forecasts are held in common.\n\u0004 The MPC meets at the beginning of the month and \ntherefore the inflation forecast is signed off after the \nmonthly policy decision is taken. To avoid any possible \nendogeneity between inflation forecasts and interest rate \ndecisions, we assume that, at the beginning of each month t, \npolicymakers observe only the forecasts available up to the \nend of the previous month, t 2 1. Data on the output gap \nforecast are confidential. The quarterly forecasts are inter-\npolated to obtain monthly series.\nthe monetary policy transmission mechanism \n(see, for instance, Lawrence Christiano, Martin \nEichenbaum, and Charles Evans 1999).\nThe historical data on individual interest \nrate votes are available online at http:\/\/www.\nbankofengland.co.uk\/monetarypolicy\/mpcvot-\ning.xls.5 The sample, between the establishment \nof the MPC in May 1997 and July 2007, cov-\ners a period of 122 meetings and 19 members \nfor a total of 971 observations. We consider only \nmembers with at least two years of experience \non the MPC.6\nIn column 1, we report the estimates of the \naggregate Taylor rule (1), while in column 2 we \nshow the estimates of the fixed-effects model \n(2).7 When the time dimension is 30 and the \ncross section 20, Judson and Owen (1999) show \nthat the small-sample bias associated with the \nGMM estimator proposed by Manuel Arellano \nand Stephen Bond (1991) is similar in magni-\ntude to the bias of the FE model. For complete-\nness, in column 3, we present the results for the \nArellano-Bond (AB) method using two lags of \nthe variables as instruments for the current val-\nues. In columns \u0004 and 5, we present the Swamy \nGLS random-coefficient estimates of model (3).\nIn the last column, the individual Taylor rules \nare augmented with a dummy variable change, \ntaking values of one, zero, and minus one \ndepending on whether the change in the policy \nrate in the previous meeting was upward, zero, \nor downward. Unlike the interest rate\u2013smooth-\ning term, ij, t21, which captures the individual \npersistence in the voting records, the variable \nchange captures the extent to which individual \ninterest rate decisions depend on the past inter-\nest rate decision of the committee as a whole.8 \n5 Whenever not specified in the dataset, we assume that \nthe magnitude of the individual votes is 25 basis points.\n6 To capture any possible time trend, we augment the \nspecifications with a proxy for experience, measured as \nthe number of months that each member has been on the \nMPC since her\/his first mandate. The estimates of the coef-\nficients on the proxy for experience are not reported but \nare available upon request. The current governor\u2019s voting \nrecord is divided into two time periods\u2014before and after \nhis appointment as governor.\n7 The average time dimension of our unbalanced panel is \n5\u0004 observations, and we  consider only those members who \nattended at least 2\u0004 consecutive meetings. This implies that \nthe size of the Nickell bias should be small (see Ruth Judson \nand Ann Owen 1999).\n8 Drawing a parallel with habits in the consumption \nliterature, we will refer to internal or external smoothing \nVOL. 98 NO. 2 221INsIDERs VERsus OutsIDERs IN MONEtARy POLIcyMAkINg\nTesting for internal versus external smoothing is \na further advantage of the RC specification.\nA number of interesting results emerge from \nTable 1. First, consistent with the analytical \nresults in Pesaran and Smith (1995) on the biases \nof pooled regression estimates in dynamic het-\nerogeneous panels, the coefficient on the lagged \ndependent variable is significantly lower using \nthe RC model.9 Second, the inflation forecast \nhas most explanatory power in the FE and RC \nspecifications, suggesting that an efficient use of \nthe cross-section information yields more accu-\nrate estimates.10 Third, the estimate of b based \non the RC specification in column \u0004 is signifi-\ncantly higher than the estimate based on the AB \nmethod in column 3.\nThe coefficient on the output gap is always \nnegative, though it is never statistically differ-\nent from zero.11 The intercept is statistically \ndepending on whether individual decisions depend on the \nindividual or aggregate lagged interest rate.\n9 As the inflation and output gaps are stationary vari-\nables, both in the theory and in the data, the apparent near-\nunit root in the nominal interest rate is likely due to the \nsmall sample.\n10 We also experiment with a more general specification \nin which individual members are allowed, but not required, \nto respond to both current inflation and the inflation fore-\ncast. The parameter on current inflation is not statistically \ndifferent from zero, and the parameter on the inflation fore-\ncast is virtually identical to the estimates in Table 1.\n11 It should be noted that the estimates of g do not imply \nthat the output gap is irrelevant for the policy decision. \nRather, they imply that the output gap is not a target per \nse and is important only to the extent it helps to forecast \nfuture inflation. Using HP-filtered real GDP, we find some \n significant at the 1 percent confidence level only \nin the RC columns, suggesting that the pooled \nestimates may be biased toward zero. The null of \nparameter constancy is strongly rejected in the \nestimation of the random coefficient models.\nThe estimate of lchange is highly significant, \nimplying that after a policy change, dissenters \nhave a tendency to vote in line with the rest of \nthe committee. The exact interpretation of this \nfinding is worthy of further investigation. A \ncomparison with the estimates of r in column 5, \nhowever, reveals that internal smoothing is far \nmore important than external smoothing.\nIn Figure 1, we plot 90 percent confidence \nintervals for the estimates of the individual \nparameters behind the RC results in column 5. \nThe long-run coefficients are computed as aj\/ 11 \n2 rj 2 , bj \/ 11 2 rj 2 , and gj \/ 11 2 rj 2 , and they \ncapture the (preferred) long-run level of the real \ninterest rate and the cumulative responses of the \nnominal interest rate to a 1 percent deviation of \ninflation and output from the reference values. \nStandard errors are computed using the delta \nmethod.\nIn each column, the 19 estimates of the indi-\nvidual long-run coefficients are reported three \ntimes, according to alternative dimensions of \nheterogeneity. The dashed lines refer to mem-\nbers appointed as internal (first row), members \nwith working experience in the Treasury prior \nevidence of a significant response to output, but the magni-\ntude of the coefficient is about nine times smaller than the \nmagnitude of the coefficient on the inflation forecast.\nTable 1\u2014Taylor Rule Estimates112 122 132 1\u00042 152\nAggregate FE AB RC RC\nr 0.985*** 0.9877*** 0.9658*** 0.895\u0004*** 0.8968***10.0182 10.00592 10.0051722 10.017012 10.015\u00042\nb 0.333 0.\u0004009*** 0.1509*** 0.3219*** 0.2399***10.2002 10.0\u0004392 10.0\u0004152 10.059\u00042 10.06172\ng 20.00289 20.0065 20.0071 20.01\u00040 20.0081110.018\u000452 10.00\u000452 10.00962 10.02052 10.016332\nlchange 0.0757***10.01882\na 0.0\u000489 0.0076 -0.00003 0.5200*** 0.5027***10.080\u00042 10.03932 10.000712 10.10602 10.09012\nObs 122 971 952 971 971\n# groups 930,925 19 19 19 19\nNote: Robust standard errors in parentheses: *** p , 0.01, ** p , 0.05, * p , 0.1.\nMAy 2008222 AEA PAPERs AND PROcEEDINgs\nto the appointment (second row) and members \nwith working experience in academia prior to \nthe appointment (third row).
