Although these\nspecies are less Lewis acidic than their aluminium counterparts\nthe ChCl\u2013ZnCl2 ionic liquids are water insensitive and zinc is\nenvironmentally more benign. These Lewis acidic solvents have\nbeen successfully employed for a variety of reactions including\nDiels\u2013Alder, Fisher indole synthesis and polymerisations.6,7 In\nthis current study we report that O-acetylation of sugars and\ncellulose can effectively be carried out using chlorozincate ionic\nliquids.\nThe O-acetylation of carbohydrates is widely employed not\nonly for the protection of hydroxy groups but also for the\npurification and structural elucidation of natural products.\nPer-O-acetylation is most frequently achieved using excess\nacetic anhydride together with a wide variety of catalysts\nincluding, amongst others, pyridine8 (and its derivatives),9\nsodium acetate,10 FeCl3,\n11 metal triflates,12 and ZnCl2.\n10 The\nreaction has also been carried out in ionic liquids although\nonly imidazolium based salts have been employed to date. Thus,\nthe acetylation of carbohydrates has been demonstrated in\nimidazolium systems containing dicyanamide13 or benzoate14\nanions and in both cases the ionic liquid acted as both solvent\nand catalyst for the reaction. In addition ionic liquids have also\nrecently been employed as media for the enzymatic acylation\nof glycosides.15\nResults and discussion\nTo test the efficacy of Lewis acidic ChCl-based mixtures for the\nacetylation of carbohydrates the compounds 1\u20134 were reacted with\nacetic anhydride in the ionic liquid for 3 h at 90 uC (Scheme 1).{\nSubstrates 1\u20134 were completely soluble under the reaction\nconditions and the mixtures were worked up by the addition of\nwater followed by extraction with ethyl acetate to give in each case\nonly the per-O-acetylated product 1a\u20134a. Table 1 summarises the\nresults of these reactions. It can be seen (entries 1\u20134) that the\n[ChCl][ZnCl2]2 ionic liquid can be successfully employed as both\nsolvent and catalyst for the acetylation of simple monosaccharides.\nThe yields for these conversions are remarkable considering the\npotential side reaction involving acetylation of choline (present in\nca. 20 mole equivalents to the substrate). In fact reaction of 1 using\nan acetylcholine chloride (AcChCl)\u2013zinc chloride mixture (entry 5)\ngave a similar yield of 1a suggesting that the potential side reaction\ndoes not significantly affect the process. The reaction is also\nsuccessful with the less Lewis acidic [ChCl][SnCl2]2 ionic liquid\n(entry 6) albeit with a slightly reduced yield. However, a eutectic\nmixture of [ChCl][Urea]2 (which forms an ionic liquid analogue\nbut has no Lewis acidity)16 gave no significant reaction (entry 7).\nIn addition to acetylation the [ChCl][ZnCl2]2 system also\nsupported reaction of 1 with propionic and isobutyric anhydrides\nto give, under the same reaction conditions, only the correspond-\ning per-O-acylated products in 65% and 33% yield respectively\n(unoptimised yields, data not shown).\nThe most intriguing result is from the reaction of 1 with only\n1 equivalent of acetic anhydride (entry 8). The only product\nisolated from this reaction was 1a (96% yield based on Ac2O) with\nno evidence for any partially acetylated intermediates. This result\ncompares favorably with our observations for the reaction of\n1 with 1 equivalent of acetic anhydride under conventional\nconditions in either pyridine (giving a complex mixture of partially\nacetylated intermediates) or ZnCl2 in THF (giving predominately\n1a together with significant amounts (ca. 20\u201330%) of partially\naDepartment of Chemistry, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK\nLE1 7RH.

The reason(s) for the selective formation\nof only 1a in the ionic liquid is not entirely clear. However, this\nnovel finding is also observed in the reaction of 1 with 1 mole\nequivalent of propionic and isobutyric anhydrides (giving only\nper-acylated products in 88 and 68% respectively (based on\nanhydride)) and we believe that this may prove an effective method\nfor producing per-acylated derivatives from synthetically or\ncommercially valuable anhydrides.\nIn seeking to explore the potential environmental benefits of our\nsystem we next examined solvent recycling. Recovery of the\nsolvent from the acetylation reactions was possible by employing a\nnon-aqueous work up (involving simple extraction of the\n[ChCl][ZnCl2]2 with ethyl acetate) followed by removal of any\nvolatiles (presumably acetic acid) from the ionic liquid in vacuo.\nPleasingly ionic liquid recovered in this way could be employed for\nthe repeated acetylation of 1 without any reduction in the reaction\nyield (run 1\u201472%, run 2\u201467%, run 3\u201471%, run 4\u201472%).\nHowever, it should be noted that failure to remove volatiles from\nthe recovered ionic liquid led to an appreciable decrease in the\nyields for subsquent reactions. Significantly the ionic liquid could\nalso be re-used for different reactions with very low levels of cross\ncontamination. Thus 4 was converted to 4a (75%, 3 : 1 mixture of\na : b anomers) and the recovered ionic liquid was subsequently\nused for the acetylation of 1 to give the product 1a in good yield\n(80%) and with ,1% (by 1H NMR) contamination by 4a. This\nfinding appreciably increases the potential scope for these ionic\nliquid reactions.\nHaving successfully demonstrated the acylation of mono-\nsacharrides we turned our attention to the acetylation of cellulose\nusing the [ChCl][ZnCl2]2 ionic liquid. Cellulose is traditionally\nacetylated using acetic anhydride, acetic acid and a sulfuric acid\ncatalyst. The process gives a product in which all three OH groups\nare acetylated and which has relatively poor mechanical properties.\nOf more importance is the diacetate (generally termed cellulose\nacetate) which is obtained from the partial hydrolysis of the\ntriacetate. Acetic anhydride and zinc chloride have also been used\nfor the acetylation of cellulose, both neat and with a variety of\nsolvents but this also gives exclusively the triacylated product.17\nRogers and colleagues recently showed that cellulose was partially\nsoluble in a variety of alkylimidazolium based ionic liquids and\nthat those containing strong hydrogen bond acceptors (e.g. Cl2)\nwere the most effective solvents especially when combined with\nmicrowave heating.18 Subsequent studies suggest that the polymer\nis disordered in these solutions.19 The first example of the\nacetylation of cellulose in an ionic liquid has recently been\nreported by Zhang and co-workers.20 The authors employed a\nnovel allylimidazolium based ionic liquid and intriguingly the\nprocess was reported to occur under homogeneous conditions and\nin the absence of any catalyst. Cellulose acetates having a degree of\nsubstitution (DS) value of between 0.64\u20132.74 (corresponding to\n21\u201391% acetylation) were produced using this system.\nUsing microwave heating as reported by Rogers we found that\nmicrocrystalline cellulose (ex. Sigma-Aldrich, DP ca. 200) was\nslightly soluble (,3 wt%) in [ChCl][ZnCl2]2. However, microwave\nconditions were not required for acetylation reactions which were\ncarried out with 100 mg of cellulose in 3 ml of ionic liquid for 3 h\nat 90 uC (traditional heating) and with varying equivalents of acetic\nanhydride. At the end of the experiments water was added to the\nreaction mixture, precipitating the product which was centrifuged,\nfiltered, washed with water and freeze dried. The resulting samples\nwere initially analysed using infrared spectroscopy and the degree\nof acetylation estimated from the ratio of peak areas in the regions\n3000\u20133500 (OH) and 1730\u20131750 (CLO) wavenumber and\ncomparison to a calibration plot for different cellulose and\ncellulose acetate standard mixtures (see ESI{). Table 2 shows a\nclear trend in that the degree of acetylation increases with the mole\nequivalents of acetic anhydride.\nThe functionalisation seen in these experiments could be due to\nper-acetylation of a fraction of the polymer chains or partial\nacetylation of all the chains. Since low molecular weight cellulose\ntriacetate is soluble in acetone the samples were extracted with\nthis solvent and only a small fraction was found to be soluble\n(ca. 1\u201310 wt%). IR analysis of this soluble material showed\nnegligible absorbance at 3000\u20133500 cm21 confirming it to be the\ntriacetate and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) indicated a\nMn of between 2470\u20132580. We assume that this small amount of\nlow molecular weight polymer is either present in the starting\ncellulose and\/or is produced by glycoside hydrolysis under the\nreaction conditions. If the low molecular weight material is fully\nsoluble in the ionic liquid then the per-acetylation is in accordance\nwith the results seen with the monosacharides described above.\nThe vast majority (.90 wt%) of the material isolated from the\nacetylation reactions was insoluble in acetone. IR analysis of this\ninsoluble fraction indicated that a significant proportion was\nacetylated and that the degree of acetylation increased with the\nequivalents of acetic anhydride used (Table 2). This finding raises\nthe possibility of controlled synthesis of partially substituted\ncellulose acetates. The greater degree of functionalisation observed\non increasing the equivalents of acetic anhydride is similar to the\nresults reported by Zhang with their allylimidazolium based ionic\nliquid.20 However, it should be noted that these authors observed\nan unexplained drop in functionalisation when.6.5 equivalents of\nacetic anhydride were employed whereas the system reported here\nTable 1 Acetylation reactions of monosaccharides in ChCl-based\nionic liquids at 90 uC for 3 h\nEntry Substrate Solvent Ac2O (eq.)

Additionally, our [ChCl][ZnCl2]2 system\nalso allows access to cellulose acetate having low levels of\nfunctionalisation (i.e. ,20% acetylation).\nAssuming that the hydroxyl groups can only react if they are\nwetted by the ionic liquid then this must involve significant\nrestructuring of the polymer. Fig. 1 shows scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM) images of starting cellulose, partially acetylated\ncellulose, cellulose that has been dissolved in the ionic liquid and\nregenerated by the addition of water and low molecular weight\ncellulose triacetate. It can be seen that dissolution of the cellulose in\nthe ionic liquid gives material having a homogeneous morphology\nwhich is consistent with the results of Rogers18 who found that\nthe structure of cellulose was opened upon contact with the\nimidazolium based ionic liquids. The partially acetylated sample\n(top right) has a structure that is intermediary between crystalline\nstarting cellulose and amorphous regenerated material suggesting\nthat only a small fraction of the polymer chains have been opened\nup by the ionic liquid.\nConclusion\nIn summary this work has shown that ionic liquids based on ZnCl2\nand ChCl are effective at carrying out O-acetylation reactions on a\nnumber of monosaccharides and cellulose. Per-O-acetylation is\nexclusively observed with monosacharrides and for low molecular\nweight polymer. Partial acetylation of cellulose is also possible with\nsome control over the degree of modification.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge EPSRC (GR\/R\n39771), the Crystal Faraday Partnership and Procter and\nGamble for funding this work.\nReferences\n1 P.
