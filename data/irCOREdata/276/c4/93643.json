Mangrove forests were also not specifically included in \u201cforests\u201d because of the decision to avoid debates about aquaculture \u2013 although many general discussions of forests included mangroves, and the total level of reporting about mangroves was small.   31","cites":null},{"id":17308500,"title":"A handbook of qualitative methodologies for mass communication research.","authors":[],"date":"1991","doi":"10.4324\/9780203409800","raw":"Jensen, K. & Jankowski, N.
