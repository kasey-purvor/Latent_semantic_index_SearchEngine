Of all species included in local and regional floras, only some take an 4 \nimportant part in early primary succession; such species must be capable of colonizing and 5 \nreaching a large cover in the restoration site (Prach and Pysek 1999). Succession at a new site 6 \nby colonization of plant species from higher spatial scales is controlled by local and regional 7 \nvariables (Caley and Schluter 1997; Hillebrand and Bleckner 2002; Kirmer et al. 2008). Both 8 \nplant species richness and composition depend on the presence of suitable abiotic conditions 9 \n(Grubb 1977; Urbanska 1997; Peach and Zedler 2006). Site conditions typical of a pioneer 10 \nstand (e.g. nutrient deficiency in terrestrial habitats) were proven to be important factors for 11 \nthe colonization by initial adapted species (Rehounkova and Prach 2006; Kirmer et al. 2008). 12 \nPhysical factors, e.g. salinity, anoxia, pH or sedimentation, strongly affect the germination 13 \nand recruitment of species in salt marshes, particularly at lower marsh elevations (Gray 1992; 14 \nHuckle et al. 2000; Tessier et al. 2000).  15 \nPopulation dynamics of plant species at the beginning of primary succession are not 16 \nonly determined by local niche-based processes, but also by seed dispersal processes (Kirmer 17 \net al. 2008), which are assumed to be particularly important in late successional stages 18 \n(Bossuyt and Honnay 2008). Seed availability (limitation) can be a major limiting factor in 19 \necological restoration projects (Ozinga et al. 2004; Dausse et al. 2008). Target species can 20 \nestablish through dispersal from source plant communities. The degree of seed limitation is 21 \nlikely to depend on the abundance of adults in the local and adjacent species pool and specific 22 \ndispersal traits of the plant species (Zobel 1997; Ozinga et al. 2005). It is expected that the 23 \nplant species that exist in the local and regional areas would have the ability to colonize a 24 \nnewly available site (Wolters et al. 2005a). Distances to seed sources (Frenzen et al. 1988), 25 \n 4 \nspatial distribution of seed sources (Wood and Del Moral 1987), neighbourhood influences 1 \n(Ryser 1990) and the movement of seeds from productive areas into the new site (Shmida and 2 \nEllner 1984) are all likely important determinants of the outcome of colonization. 3 \nIn salt-marsh restoration, the fastest development of vegetation is expected from the 4 \ncommunity species pool within a target area, either from established vegetation or the below-5 \nground seed bank (Wolters et al. 2008). Colonization of plants from the species pool is a two-6 \nstep process: seed availability and germination. Seed availability is the first step needed to 7 \nestablish a population from seed, but does not guarantee seed germination. Seed dispersal 8 \nalone, only makes a species a member of the potential flora of the site, not its actual flora 9 \n(Major and Pyott 1966). Species abundance in the local species pool was also found to be 10 \nimportant for determining the order of colonization in salt marshes with late establishers 11 \nbeing less abundant on the adjacent marshes than intermediate colonizers (Wolters et al. 12 \n2008). Dispersal ability affects the probability of a plant species to colonize a new substrate 13 \n(Wilson and Traveset 2000), initial colonizers having a high dispersal ability compared to 14 \nspecies that would colonize later. The tidal current is the most important agent to disperse 15 \nplant seeds in salt marshes. Although seeds of most salt-marsh species can immerse or float in 16 \nseawater (Packham and Willis 1997), buoyancy of seeds and flotation period are different in 17 \nvarious species, which affects the dispersal ability of salt-marsh species (Huiskes et al. 1995). 18 \nSeveral factors affect the buoyancy of seeds, such as seed shape (defined as length \/ width: 19 \nGrime et al. 1988) and seed mass; with increasing seed shape and seed mass, seed buoyancy 20 \nis reduced (Poschlod et al. 2005). It is expected that initial colonizers in a salt marsh have 21 \nseeds with a shorter length, wider width and lower seed mass than the species of later 22 \nsuccessional stages. In terrestrial habitats, species tend to present heavier seeds in late 23 \nsuccessional than in early successional ones (Fenner 1987; Leishman 1999), but few studies 24 \nhave examined such relationship in salt-marsh habitats. Lastly, seed germination is a complex 25 \n 5 \nphysiological process depending on many environmental conditions (Mayer and Poljakoff-1 \nMayber 1982). It can be expected that species with high salinity tolerance germinate and 2 \nestablish earlier (Wolters et al. 2008). Of all species included in a regional and local flora, 3 \nonly some take an important part in early primary succession; such species must be capable of 4 \ncolonizing and reaching a large cover in a restoration site (Prach and Pysek 1999). There are 5 \nfew studies that have synchronically examined factors affecting mechanisms for distribution 6 \nand colonization in a newly created salt marsh in Europe.  7 \nThe present paper aims to determine the factors affecting both plant colonisation and 8 \ndistribution in a newly created salt marsh in the Yzer estuary, Belgium, by addressing the 9 \nfollowing questions: what seed and plant traits are important in the establishment of primary 10 \ncolonizers in a salt marsh restoration scheme, and is colonisation limited by seed availability 11 \nor by abiotic conditions? We first tested the hypothesis that seed dispersal traits may limit 12 \nplant colonisation by comparing the seed availability in the reference site and the seed bank in 13 \nthe restoration site. First year colonizers are hypothesized to show shorter seed length, wider 14 \nseed width and lower seed mass than those colonizing in later years. We then tested the 15 \nhypothesis that, beside seed availability, the success of restoration can be influenced by plant 16 \ntraits (as a surrogate of site suitability) by comparing the seed bank and the plant presence and 17 \ncover in the restoration site. In particular highly salt and nutrient-limitation tolerant species 18 \nare expected to be earlier colonizers than less salt tolerant and less nutrient-limitation tolerant 19 \nspecies. 20 \n 21 \n 22 \n 6 \nMaterial and Methods 1 \nStudy area 2 \nThe study area is situated in the Yzer estuary, part of the IJzermonding nature reserve 3 \non the Belgian North Sea coast. A new salt marsh (ca 14ha) was created after the removal of 4 \nbuildings and slurry material during large nature restoration works in the period 1999-2002. 5 \n(Hoffmann 2006). The objective of the restoration project was to restore beach-dune-salt-6 \nmarsh ecotones from a quasi-virgin situation by the dispersal of target species from the local 7 \nspecies pool (adjacent salt marshes and sand dunes) by natural colonization. In the newly 8 \ncreated intertidal area (hereafter called the restoration site), gradual elevational gradients were 9 \ncreated, ensuring inundation frequency conditions between 100% and 0% inundation. The 10 \narea was exposed to tidal inundation from the beginning of 2002 onwards. This way, the 11 \nunique opportunity was created to study the sequence of species establishment in relation to 12 \nsite suitability, seed availability, species pools and traits.  13 \nFrom a pilot study of the seed bank of some intertidal mud flats, newly created after 14 \nremoval of 3 to 4 meters of slurry material (Stichelmans 2002, cit. in Hoffmann and 15 \nStichelmans 2006) at the study site, we could conclude that no relevant salt- marsh species 16 \nseed bank was available in the formerly buried, newly exposed mud flat soil. This indicates 17 \nthat the soil of the rest of the restoration site, that was buried for several decades, would also 18 \nbe free of salt-marsh species seeds. Colonization of the site therefore relied entirely on 19 \ndiaspores from external sources. In salt marshes, hydrochory has been reported as the 20 \npreferential mode for seed dispersal, which is mostly of a local character, even though some 21 \nseeds can disperse over long distances, up to 60 km per week (Koutstaal et al. 1987; Huiskes 22 \net al. 1995). The presence of a naturally established salt marsh in the adjacent Yzer estuary 23 \nwas considered here as the only local source of diaspores for the restoration site because the 24 \n 7 \nmost proximate salt-marsh areas are approx. 50 km southwest and 42 km northeast of the 1 \npresent study area. 2 \nThe old adjacent natural salt marsh (hereafter called the reference site) consists of two 3 \nparts (Fig. 1): a large one (O1) at the west and in free tidal current contact with the restoration 4 \nsite (N), and a smaller (O2) located in the south of the restoration site and separated from it by 5 \na dike (with a 7 m height), not allowing direct tidal current contact between both..  6 \n 7 \nSeed production in the reference site 8 \nSeeds produced by salt-marsh species were collected from the reference site to estimate 9 \nseed production. Three sites were randomly selected, one in the southern part (O2) and two in 10 \nthe west part (O1). At each site, 10 samples were randomly collected in plots of 50 * 50 cm 11 \non four occasions between the beginning of September and the end of October, 2008. Seeds 12 \nwere collected before they were completely ripened and naturally dispersed. Each sample 13 \ncontained all flowering stems for perennials and all entire plants for annuals per quadrates 50 14 \n* 50 cm. The average total seed production was measured in each spike for grasses and each 15 \nflower for flowering species. After the number of spikes and flowers was counted, we counted 16 \nthe number of seeds for one unit randomly chosen for each quadrate. Mean seed production 17 \nby unit was estimated by using the average seed production across quadrates where the plant 18 \nwas present. Finally, the total seed production was calculated for the entire reference site by 19 \nmultiplying the number of seeds per unit, the number of units per quadrate and the total area 20 \nof the site divided by the surface of the quadrate, taking into account the cover of every 21 \nspecies in the different salt-marsh habitats.  22 \n 23 \nSeed bank in the restoration site 24 \n 8 \nThe seed bank of the restoration site was sampled in 2006, four years after the site was 1 \nfirst exposed to tidal inundation. With an auger with a diameter of 3 cm, 10 soil cores were 2 \nrandomly collected in close proximity of permanent plots and across the restoration site, to a 3 \ndepth of 15 cm, ensuring taking samples of all newly accreted marine sediments. The samples 4 \nwere collected in March 2006 after natural stratification during winter. The big parts of litter 5 \nlayer were removed in the field and samples transferred to the laboratory. The methodology 6 \nof ter Heerdt et al. (1996) was used to concentrate the soil seed bank samples, which were 7 \nwashed through a coarse (2 mm mesh width) and a fine (0.18 mm mesh width) sieve, 8 \nremoving all roots and coarse vegetative parts on the first sieve, and withholding the vast 9 \nmajority of seeds on the second, while most of the soil material flushed away through the 10 \nlatter sieve. The concentrated samples were spread in a thin layer (maximum 0.4 cm thick) in 11 \n40 cm * 40 cm trays filled with sterilized potting soil. The trays were placed in a greenhouse 12 \nin a random order with a natural light regime and were kept moist by regular rain water 13 \nspraying. Air temperature varied between 14 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C throughout the experiment. 24 14 \ncontrol trays, filled with the same sterilized potting soil, were randomly placed among the 15 \nseed bank trays in order to test for possible greenhouse and potting soil seed contamination.  16 \nSeedlings were identified as soon as possible after germination, counted and removed 17 \nor, if they could not be identified immediately, transplanted to pots to allow further growth. 18 \nAfter 6 months, when no further seedlings germinated, the trays were left to dry for two 19 \nweeks. This allowed the sample to be crumbled to expose deeper buried seeds to the light. 20 \nAfter watering the samples for another 3 weeks and controlling the light regime in 8 hr 21 \ndark\/16 hr light conditions, no new seedlings emerged. Finally, the residual soil was checked 22 \nfor remaining seeds by viewing small random samples taken from trays under a microscope 23 \nand probing seeds with a needle in order to distinguish any remaining, potentially viable 24 \nseeds. Since, the number of seeds that remained in the investigated soil samples was very low 25 \n 9 \n(none in most cases, and always less than 3 per tray), we did not need to correct for remaining 1 \nseeds. Mean number of seeds per m\u00b2 was finally calculated from the 10 cores for each species 2 \nrecorded in the seed bank samples taken from the restoration site.  3 \n 4 \nVegetation cover within the restoration and reference sites 5 \nVegetation data were collected in the restoration site and adjacent reference salt marshes in 6 \npermanent plots. Cover of all vascular plant species was visually estimated, using a decimal 7 \nscale (Londo 1976). According to the size of the surface of the restoration site and adjacent 8 \nsalt marshes, 176 and 86 permanent 4 m\u00b2 (2 * 2 m) plots were collected. Vegetation was 9 \nsampled in 2003, 2005 and 2007 along six randomly chosen transects, which were established 10 \nperpendicular to the main elevation gradient (inundation frequency). Plots were distributed 11 \nevenly across transects at 3 m intervals to account for vegetation heterogeneity across the 12 \nstudy sites. Nomenclature followed Lambinon et al. (1998). 13 \n 14 \nPlant traits and site suitability 15 \nThe selection of plant traits was based on previous studies by Wolters et al. (2008) and 16 \nprior expectations about possible effect on the abundance of new colonizers. We selected six 17 \ntraits related to environmental factors and seed morphology: the Ellenberg indices for 18 \nnutrients, salinity and moisture (Ellenberg et al. 1991) and three seed traits: seed length, seed 19 \nwidth and seed mass. Seed length and width are correlated to seed shape, which is related to 20 \nseed buoyancy (Poschlod et al. 2005). Ellenberg indices were used to estimate the species 21 \ntolerance to environmental factors and seed traits were used to estimate the seed dispersal 22 \nability. Dispersal traits were abstracted from the Biolflor database 23 \n(http:\/\/www.ufz.de\/biolflor\/index.jsp), and the Leda trait database (Knevel et al. 2003, 24 \nhttp:\/\/www.leda-traitbase.org\/LEDA) for salt-marsh species.  25 \n 10 \n 1 \nStatistical analyses     2 \nThe average cover of each species in the restoration site and adjacent reference salt 3 \nmarsh were correlated by Pearson correlation index for each year separately. For analyzing 4 \nchanges in species cover along time, average covers of dominant species (i.e. having a cover 5 \nof at least 5% during our study) were compared among years by T-tests for dependant 6 \nsamples for each site separately (after Bonferonni correction for multiple comparisons). Plant 7 \ntrait analysis was performed in order to detect the differences in trait promotion or inhibition 8 \nduring succession from 2003 until 2007. For each plant trait (three Ellenberg\u2019s indicators and 9 \nthree seed traits) weighted averages were calculated at the plot level in all three years 10 \nseparately, i.e. 2003, 2005 and 2007. All trait data were continuous. The species traits were 11 \ncompared between three years (2003, 2005 and 2007) using repeated measurements General 12 \nLinear Modelling (GLM) and a pairwise LSD test. Calculations were down with SPSS 15.0. 13 \nAll data met normal distribution criteria according to Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (after 14 \nlog(x+1) transformation for plant covers).  15 \n 16 \nResults 17 \nSeed production at the reference site 18 \nSeed production as observed for different salt-marsh species is given in Table 1. In 19 \nsome species, no flowering stems were observed in any of the four sampling sessions. Some 20 \nperennial graminoid species were contaminated by fungi. For Aster tripolium, each flowering 21 \nbranch contained on average 85\u00b114 flowers. Each flower contained 17\u00b17.6 seeds. For Elymus 22 \nathericus, most florets were empty, but by taking into account the percentage cover of this 23 \nspecies, total seed production is still being estimated to be no less than 6.7*10\n5\n seeds for the 24 \n 11 \nreference site. For Puccinellia maritima, flowering stems were never observed. For Spartina 1 \ntownsendii, most spikes were contaminated with Claviceps purpurea and\/or empty. 2 \n 3 \nSeed bank at the restoration site 4 \nThe number of species within the seed bank of the restoration site was limited (Table 2). 5 \nThe density of seeds in the seed bank in the restoration site was entirely dominated by annual 6 \nspecies. Characteristic perennial salt-marsh species, present in the above-ground vegetation of 7 \nthe reference site, were not recorded within the restoration site seed bank (Elymus athericus, 8 \nLimonium vulgare, Plantago maritima, Puccinellia maritima, Salsola kali, Artemisia 9 \nmaritima and Spartina townsendii). Aster tripolium and Triglochin maritimum were only 10 \nrecorded from one core with one germinating seed each.  Although the pioneer species Beta 11 \nvulgaris ssp. maritima was present in the above-ground vegetation of the reference site, it was 12 \nnot found in any of both seed banks, nor in the above-ground vegetation of the restoration 13 \nsite. 14 \n 15 \nVegetation cover within the restoration site and adjacent local salt marsh 16 \nIn 2003, one year after being exposed to tidal flooding, 79% of the species present in 17 \nthe adjacent old salt marshes germinated within the restoration site (Table 3). Species from 18 \nthe adjacent species pool that established during the first year were predominantly annuals. 19 \nThe restoration site was dominated by the annual species Suaeda maritima, Atriplex spp., 20 \nSalsola kali and Salicornia europaea. The adjacent salt marshes were dominated by the 21 \nperennial species Elymus athericus, Puccinellia maritima and Limonium vulgare. There was 22 \nno significant correlation between species cover within the restoration and the reference sites 23 \nin the first year of colonization.  24 \n 12 \nIn 2005, after three years of tidal inundation, 81% species growing in the adjacent salt 1 \nmarshes were recorded in the restoration site. Plantago coronopus and Parapholis strigosa, 2 \nabsent in 2003, were recorded in 2005 within the restoration site for the first time. There was 3 \na significant correlation between species abundance within the restoration and the reference 4 \nsites in 2005 (P<0.01, r = 0.50).  5 \nIn 2007, 84% species growing in the reference salt marsh were recorded in the 6 \nvegetation of the restoration site. Species abundance in the new salt marsh was positively 7 \ncorrelated to species abundance in the adjacent salt marsh (P<0.01, r = 0.44). Plantago 8 \nmaritima, which was only present in the old salt marsh part O2 (Fig. 1), isolated from the 9 \nrestoration site by a dike was not found back in the investigated plots of the restoration site; it 10 \nwas however present with very few individuals outside the restoration site plots in 2005 and 11 \n2007. Triglochin maritimum and Artemisia maritima (the latter outside sampled vegetation 12 \nplots), both also restricted to the old salt-marsh part O2, remained entirely absent from the 13 \nrestoration site. The percentage cover of all the dominant species increased along time in the 14 \nrestoration whereas it remained constant in most cases in the reference site (Table 3). 15 \n 16 \nPlant traits 17 \nSeeds of early colonizers had the shortest length and seed length increased in time 18 \n(Table 4). There was no significant difference in seed width between early and later 19 \ncolonizing species. Seed mass was lowest in 2003 and 2005, and highest in 2007. The 20 \nweighted average of Ellenberg indicator of salinity was higher in 2003 and 2005 than in 2007. 21 \nThere was a significant decreasing trend in Ellenberg nitrogen indicator value from 2003 to 22 \n2007. The early colonizers had the highest Ellenberg nitrogen indicator value in the 23 \nrestoration site. No clear trend was detected for moisture indication number from 2003 to 24 \n2007 (Table 4). 25 \n 13 \n 1 \nDiscussion 2 \nLimonium vulgare, Puccinellia maritima, Elymus athericus and Spartina townsendii 3 \nwere the late colonizers of the restoration site. We conclude that viable seed availability might 4 \nbe the most important constraint for these species to act as early colonizers. Nonetheless, all 5 \nspecies can disperse seeds via seawater well (Boorman 1967; Gray and Scott 1977; Adam 6 \n1990; Huiskes et al. 1995). Since the seeds of these species also did not appear in the seed 7 \nbank of the restoration site neither, probably the production of viable seeds is a very probable 8 \nconstraint to the appearance of these species as important initial colonizers in our study area, 9 \nparticular those species coming from low salt-marsh zones, i.e. Spartina townsendii, 10 \nLimonium vulgare and Puccinellia maritima. The seed production estimates confirm this 11 \nstatement for some species only. In this study we used both seed production per unit and 12 \ndominance of plant species for estimating seed availability. Despite the fact that the number 13 \nof seeds of a given species available for dispersal may vary within a given site, according the 14 \nparental abundance of species (Bertness et al. 1987), we wanted to estimate the global seed 15 \nproduction per plant species by taking into account the mean number of seed per unit and a 16 \nproxy of the number of units within the entire reference site. This particularly allowed us to 17 \ntake into account the important cover of some species with low seed production. Indeed, 18 \nElymus athericus produced a relatively high seed number in the entire reference salt marshes, 19 \nindicating necessity of study on seed viability for this species. Concerning inter-annual 20 \nvariations in seed production, we can compare our results from 2008 to those obtained within 21 \nthe same study site in 2006 by (Castermans 2007) for Aster tripolium. She found that each 22 \nflowering stem contained on average 89.76 flowers and each flower contained on average 23 23 \nseeds, leading to a mean seed production with the same order of magnitude (2064 seeds per 24 \nunit in 2006, standard errors are not available, vs. 1445\u00b1650 seeds per unit in 2008). We thus 25 \n 14 \nargue that despite possible intra-site and inter-annual variations, our estimation of global seed 1 \nproduction per species can be considered as a reliable general indicator of seed availability for 2 \nnew colonizers in the restoration site. 3 \nDespite the rapid colonization of most of the species recorded in the local species pool, 4 \nthe abundance of early colonizers in the restoration site was not related to their abundance in 5 \nthe adjacent salt marsh. Elymus athericus was dominant in the reference marshes, while, one 6 \nyear after creation, its cover and presence was extremely low in the restoration site. 7 \nAdversely, Suaeda maritima was the dominant and most frequent species in the restoration 8 \nsite in 2003, while it appeared with very low cover values in the adjacent salt marshes. There 9 \nwas no correlation between the abundance of species in the restored and adjacent salt marsh in 10 \nthe first year of colonization, indicating that the relative cover of initial colonizers is 11 \ndetermined by seed production rather than by standing cover in the reference sites. This again 12 \nconfirms the first hypothesis, indicating some species despite high abundance in the 13 \nsurrounding area can not be first colonizers since they can not produce sufficient viable seeds.    14 \n The early colonizers of the restoration site in 2003 had the shortest seed length and 15 \nlowest seed mass (second hypothesis). As the ratio of length over width (seed shape) and seed 16 \nmass has been proven to be negatively correlated with seed buoyancy (Poschlod et al. 2005), 17 \nit can be concluded that initial colonizers had a higher buoyancy and therefore greater 18 \ndispersal ability than late colonizers. In addition, it has been demonstrated that seeds of 19 \npioneer species can disperse by other mechanisms, i.e. not only as seed, but also as seedling 20 \nand adult plant (Dalby 1963; Morisawa 1999; Davy et al. 2001), increasing the chance of a 21 \nhigher number of seeds to disperse. 22 \nSalicornia, Salsola and Suaeda were the dominant genera in the early stages of 23 \nvegetation colonization within the restoration site. In our study, these genera only comprised 24 \nannual species that produce large seed numbers (Wolters and Bakker 2002; Morisawa 1999; 25 \n 15 \nDavy et al. 2001). The large seed production (production of up to one million seeds per plant 1 \nin Salsola kali: Duke, 1983 cited by Wolters et al. 2008 and 300-30000 per m\u00b2 in Salicornia 2 \nand Suaeda: Wolters et al. 2008 and the results of this study), high viability (Davy et al. 3 \n2001), high floatability of seeds (shortest seed length and lowest seed mass) and seedling and 4 \nentire plant, may explain their rapid colonization within the first year after creating the new 5 \nsalt marsh.  6 \nSalinity was not shown to be the most important factor inhibiting the germination and 7 \nestablishment of species (part of the second hypothesis), since the Ellenberg index for salinity 8 \nwas between six and eight. If their seeds were transported to the restoration site and did not 9 \ngerminate, the seeds should have appeared in the seed bank. The data of the seed bank 10 \nshowed that some species had little or no seed bank available in the restoration site. 11 \nTherefore, seed availability might be the most important factor to explain the absence of these 12 \nspecies as initial colonizers. Nevertheless, species that colonized in 2003 and 2005, showed 13 \nhigher mean salt tolerance than species that colonized in 2007, indicating also higher salt 14 \ntolerance for initial colonizers. Wolters et al. (2008) stated that salinity was the most 15 \nimportant factor influencing the absence or presence of species as initial colonizers. In 16 \ngeneral, the late increase in abundance of these perennial species suggests that the increase of 17 \nabundance is mainly occurring by clonal expansion. 18 \nEarly colonizing species had the lowest nutrient Ellenberg indices. In this study, Salsola 19 \nkali, with low nutrient-limitation tolerance, had a high abundance in the first year of 20 \ncolonization. However, previous studies showed that nutrient availability is rarely limiting in 21 \nsalt-marsh systems with the exception of those of barrier islands (van Wijnen and Bakker 22 \n1999).  23 \n The presence of a salt marsh close to restoration sites appears to be a pre-requisite for 24 \nrapid regeneration and colonization of new salt marsh (Wolters et al. 2008; Thom et al. 2002). 25 \n 16 \nIndeed, creation of an intertidal area in a much more isolated restoration site in the nature 1 \nreserve the Westhoek, remained devoid of salt-marsh species since its creation in 2004 (pers. 2 \nobs., last author). Four years after creation, the restored Yzer marsh showed species 3 \ncomposition similar to that of adjacent old salt marshes. The speed and rate of colonization in 4 \nour study area was similar to that observed in the Sieperda tidal marsh in Scheldt estuary in 5 \nthe Netherlands (Eertman et al. 2002). Vegetation succession took place rapidly and within 5 6 \nyears, the newly created mudflat became colonized with most adjacently appearing salt-marsh 7 \nspecies. The same pattern and progress was observed in an estuarine restoration site in the Elk 8 \nRiver Estuary, USA (Thom et al. 2002), which was created by re-introducing a tidal 9 \ninundation regime to a former embankment area. Here, the largest increase in number of 10 \nspecies occurred 3 years after de-embankment and after 5 years species diversity was similar 11 \nto an adjacent reference marsh.  In our study, most species growing on the reference salt 12 \nmarsh were also recovered in the vegetation of the restoration site shortly after creation.  13 \nA review of salt-marsh restoration at different sites in north-west Europe showed that 14 \nbetween 48% and 100% of the species present in the local species pool established in the 15 \nrestoration site within 1-13 years after de-embankment (Wolters et al. 2008). Compared with 16 \nthe regional species pool, only 26-64% of the species established in the restoration sites 17 \n(Wolters et al. 2005b; Wolters 2006). Wolters et al. (2008) showed that 8 years after 18 \nrestoration, only 32% of the regional species pool had established in the Tollesbury 19 \nrestoration site and the establishment of regional salt-marsh species in new salt marsh may 20 \ntake several years to be reached and established. The distance between the restoration site and 21 \nexisting salt marshes and the number of inundations per year may be important determinants 22 \nof the speed with which newly created intertidal areas are colonized. This is shown by at least 23 \nthree species present on the old salt-marsh part O2 (Fig. 1) of the Yzer which were not 24 \nrecorded in plots on the restoration site by 2007 (Artemisia maritima, Plantago maritima and 25 \n 17 \nTriglochin maritimum). Since at least both last species produce sufficient seeds that can float 1 \nin sea water from a few hours to several months and most seeds retain their viability in salt 2 \nwater and germinate when exposed to suitable conditions (Reading et al. 2008), their seeds 3 \napparently did not reach the restoration site in sufficient large numbers to allow successful 4 \ncolonization. The lack of colonization success of these three species is most probably caused 5 \nby the low connectivity between O2 and the restoration site (cf. Fig. 1), both being separated 6 \nby a narrow 7m TAW high dike (mean high water tide is approx. 4.45m TAW; mean spring 7 \ntide high water reaches 4.86m TAW). We can conclude from these findings that hydrological 8 \nconnectivity between seed source and sink is vital for successful colonization of salt-marsh 9 \nrestoration sites. Even a distance of only 1 km between seed source and seed sink area, which 10 \nis the approximate distance at the study site between the old salt marsh O2 and the restoration 11 \nsite along a strongly curved line, seems unbridgeable on the short term (six years). 12 \n 13 \nConclusions 14 \nThe present study showed that the development of salt-marsh target species could be 15 \nrestricted by limited viable seed production and unfavourable soil conditions. In its current 16 \nstate there is little hope that the vegetation of the restoration site will evolve towards a 17 \ncomplete range of salt-marsh vegetation on the short run. It seems some species such as 18 \nArtemisia maritima, Plantago maritima and Triglochin maritimum would benefit from 19 \n(artificial) seed introduction in the restoration site. Some species such as Spartina townsendii 20 \nmay not be able to perform as a pioneer species in the restoration site even if safe sites and a 21 \nproper elevation level (i.e. inundation frequency) would be available. Nevertheless, it would 22 \nbe able to expand substantially by rhizome dispersal, followed by vegetative expansion 23 \n(Garbutt and Wolters 2008). The successful establishment and spread of this species has been 24 \nwell documented and was largely attributable to the species\u2019 rapid dispersal by rhizome 25 \npieces, perennial life-history and the colonization of mudflats formally unoccupied by salt-26 \n 18 \nmarsh plants (Gray et al. 1990). This study confirms the importance of a salt marsh nearby to 1 \na restoration site and the importance of a continuous, short and straightforward water bridge 2 \nbetween seed source and sink.   3 \n 4 \nAcknowledgments 5 \nThe first author was partly founded by a grant from the Ministry of Science, Researche 6 \nand Technology (Islamic Republic of Iran).
