We prove analogues of results of Glauberman and Thompson for fu-\nsion systems. Namely, given a (saturated) fusion system F on a finite p-group S,\nand in the cases where p is odd or F is S4-free, we show that Z(NF (J(S))) = Z(F)\n(Glauberman), and that if CF (Z(S)) = NF (J(S)) = FS(S), then F = FS(S)\n(Thompson). As a corollary, we obtain a stronger form of Frobenius\u2019 theorem for\nfusion systems, applicable under the above assumptions, and generalizing another\nresult of Thompson.\n1. Introduction\nFusion systems were developed in the early 1990\u2019s as a way to unify fusion phe-\nnomena occuring both in finite groups and in the p-blocks of finite groups. This\naxiomatic approach introduced by Puig has proved successful in that many of the\nimportant theorems in local group analysis are now placed into this categorical\nframework (see [1], [2], [10]). For instance, there are fusion system analogues of\nFrobenius\u2019 p-nilpotency criterion (see [8, Theorem 3.11]), Alperin\u2019s fusion theorem\n(see [8, Theorem 5.2]), Glauberman and Thompson\u2019s p-nilpotency criterion and\nGlauberman\u2019s ZJ-theorem (see [7]). Following in the spirit of recent works of Kessar\nand Linckelmann, this paper generalizes some classical results in group theory of\nGlauberman and Thompson to the more abstract world of fusion systems.\nIn \u00a72, we will state the definition of a fusion system, set up some notation and\nrecall some of the standard tools. Additionally, we examine the properties of central\nelements in a fusion system and use this to determine the center of a fusion subsystem\n(Lemma 2.8). We also generalize Glauberman\u2019s definition of a conjugation family to\nfusion systems and prove that a set of representatives for the isomorphism classes\nof a conjugation family is again a conjugation family (Proposition 2.10). This will\nshow that the (F ,W)-well-placed subgroups form a conjugation family, where F is\na fusion system and W is a positive characteristic p-functor (see Definition 2.11).\nIn \u00a73, we will recall two theorems of Glauberman and Thompson (see Theorem G\nand Theorem T) as presented in Glauberman\u2019s article [6]. In \u00a74, we will first prove\nthe fusion system version of Theorem G in Theorem 4.1, adapting Glauberman\u2019s\noriginal proof (cf. [5, Theorem 6]), by examining a minimal counterexample, and\nshowing that it is constrained (see Remark 2.17). This enables us to conclude by\napplying Theorem G. Thereafter, we prove a fusion system version of Theorem T\nin Theorem 4.5, which arises as an easy corollary of Theorem 4.1. Finally, we show\nDate: February 6, 2008.\n\u2020Research supported by Swiss National Research Fellowship PA002-113164\/1.\n1\n2 ANTONIO DI\u00b4AZ, ADAM GLESSER, NADIA MAZZA\u2020, AND SEJONG PARK\nhow Theorem 4.5 implies a strengthening of Frobenius\u2019 theorem for fusion systems\nwhen p is odd or the fusion system is S4-free (see Corollary 4.6).\n2. Generalities\nThroughout, let p be a prime number and let S be a finite p-group.\nDefinition 2.1. A fusion system on S is a category F having as objects the sub-\ngroups of S and for any two subgroups Q, R of S the morphism set HomF(Q,R) is\na set of injective group homomorphisms Q\u2192 R with the following properties:\n(1) composition of morphisms in F is the usual composition of group homomor-\nphisms;\n(2) if \u03d5 : Q\u2192 R is a morphism in F then so is the induced group isomorphism\nQ \u223c= \u03d5(Q) as well as its inverse;\n(3) HomF(Q,R) contains the set HomS(Q,R) of group homomorphisms Q\u2192 R\ngiven by conjugation with elements in S.\n(4) AutS(S) is a Sylow p-subgroup of AutF(S);\n(5) if \u03d5 : Q\u2192 S is a morphism in F such that |NS(\u03d5(Q))| \u2265 |NS(\u03c4(Q))| for any\n\u03c4 \u2208 HomF(Q,S), then \u03d5 extends to a morphism \u03c8 : N\u03d5 \u2192 S in F where N\u03d5\nis the subgroup of NS(Q) consisting of all y \u2208 NS(Q) for which there exists\nz \u2208 NS(\u03d5(Q)) with the property that \u03d5(yuy\u22121) = z\u03d5(u)z\u22121 for all u \u2208 Q.\nFollowing Stancu [11], axioms (4) and (5) imply the a priori stronger axioms used in\nthe work of Broto-Levi-Oliver [4], where fusion systems are called saturated fusion\nsystems. We will refer to axiom (5) as the extension axiom. It is easy to see from\nits definition that N\u03d5 is the largest subgroup of NS(Q) to which \u03d5 extends and that\nQCS(Q) \u2264 N\u03d5.\nRemark 2.2. Let G be a finite group and let S be a Sylow p-subgroup of G. For any\ntwo subgroups Q, R of G denote by HomG(Q,R) the set of group homomorphisms\nQ \u2192 R given by conjugation with elements of G. The fusion system of G on S is\nthe category denoted by FS(G) having the subgroups of S as objects and the sets\nHomG(Q,R) as morphism sets, for any two subgroups Q, R of S. The category\nFS(G) is a fusion system on S (see [8, Theorem 2.11]). Axiom (3) in Definition 2.1\nimplies that any fusion system F on S contains the fusion system FS(S) of S on\nitself. This latter is called the trivial fusion system on S.\nLet us recall that G is p-nilpotent if and only if G has a normal p-complement,\nthat is, there exists a normal subgroup H of G of order not divisible by p and such\nthat the factor group G\/H is a p-group. A theorem of Frobenius implies that G\nis p-nilpotent if and only if the factor groups NG(Q)\/CG(Q) are p-groups for any\nnontrivial p-subgroup Q of G or, equivalently, FS(G) = FS(S). This latter condition\nyields the corresponding notion of p-nilpotency for a fusion system F on S. That is\nF = FS(S) or, equivalently, AutF(Q) is a p-group for all nontrivial subgroups Q of\nS (cf. [8, Theorem 3.11]).\nDefinition 2.3. Let F be a fusion system on S and let Q be a subgroup of S.\nGLAUBERMAN AND THOMPSON\u2019S THEOREMS FOR FUSION SYSTEMS 3\n(1) We say that two subsets A,B \u2286 S are F-conjugate, or F-isomorphic, and\nwrite A =F B, if there exists an isomorphism \u03d5 in F such that \u03d5(A) = B.\nWe write AF for the F -conjugacy class of A.\n(2) Q is called fully F -normalized if |NS(Q)| \u2265 |NS(R)| for any R \u2208 QF ; simi-\nlarly, Q is called fully F -centralized if |CS(Q)| \u2265 |CS(R)| for any R \u2208 QF .\n(3) Q is called F -centric if CS(R) = Z(R) for any R \u2208 QF , and Q is called\nF -radical if AutQ(Q) is the largest normal p-subgroup of AutF(Q).\n(4) Let us denote by F f ,F z,F c and F r the set of all fully F -normalized, fully\nF -centralized, F -centric and F -radical subgroups of S, respectively. For\nX \u2286 {f, z, c, r}, set FX = \u22c2\nx\u2208X\nFx.\n(5) Let R be a subgroup of S and let \u03d5 \u2208 HomF(R,S). We say that \u03d5 stably\nextends to Q if QR is a subgroup of S and there exists a morphism \u03d5\u02dc \u2208\nHomF(QR,S) such that \u03d5\u02dc|R = \u03d5 and \u03d5\u02dc(Q) = Q. If, in addition, \u03d5\u02dc|Q = IdQ,\nthen we say that \u03d5 centrally extends to Q.\n(6) The normalizer of Q in F is the category NF(Q) with objects the subgroups\nof NS(Q) and morphisms HomNF (Q)(U, V ) all morphisms U \u2192 V in F that\nstably extend to Q. We say that Q is normal in F (and write Q C F) if\nF = NF(Q), i.e., if every morphism in F stably extends to Q. In particular,\nif QC F , then Q E S.\n(7) The centralizer of Q in F is the category CF(Q) with objects the subgroups\nof CS(Q) and morphisms HomCF (Q)(U, V ) all morphisms U \u2192 V in F that\ncentrally extend to Q. We say that Q is central in F if F = CF(Q), i.e., if\nevery morphism in F centrally extends to Q. In particular, if Q is central in\nF , then Q \u2264 Z(S). Also, since the product of two central subgroups of F is\nagain central in F , we call the largest central subgroup of F the center of F\nand we denote it by Z(F).\n(8) The AutS(Q)-normalizer of Q in F is the category NS(Q)CF(Q) with objects\nthe subgroups of NS(Q) and morphisms HomNS(Q)CF (Q)(U, V ) all morphisms\n\u03d5 : U \u2192 V in F for which there exists an extension \u03d5\u02dc : QU \u2192 QV in F\nsuch that \u03d5\u02dc|Q \u2208 AutS(Q).\n(9) Assume that Q is normal in F . The category F\/Q is the category whose\nobjects are the subgroups of S\/Q and for any two subgroups U and V of\nS containing Q, a group homomorphism \u03d5 : U\/Q \u2192 V\/Q is a morphism\nin F\/Q if there exists \u03d5 \u2208 HomF(U, V ) such that \u03d5(u)Q = \u03d5(uQ) for all\nu \u2208 U .\nPuig proved (see [8, Theorem 3.2]) that if Q \u2208 F f then NF(Q) is a fusion system\non NS(Q). Similarly, if Q \u2208 F z, then CF(Q) is a fusion system on CS(Q) and\nNS(Q)CF(Q) is a fusion system on NS(Q). Finally, if Q is normal in F , then F\/Q\nis a fusion system on S\/Q (see [8, Theorem 6.2]). Let us also recall a useful result\nof Stancu (see [9, Proposition 1.6]) which says\n(2.4) if Q \u2208 F f , then Q \u2208 F z and AutS(Q) \u2208 Sylp(AutF(Q)).\nNotice that the extension axiom says that any morphism \u03d5 in F whose image\nis fully F -normalized extends to a morphism in F whose domain is N\u03d5. Obvious\n4 ANTONIO DI\u00b4AZ, ADAM GLESSER, NADIA MAZZA\u2020, AND SEJONG PARK\nexamples of fully F -normalized (resp., fully F -centralized) subgroups of S are the\nnormal (resp., central) subgroups of S.\nThe following lemma gives a criterion for when the AutS(Q)-normalizer is the\nentire fusion system. This result will be used in the proof of Corollary 4.6.\nLemma 2.5. Let F be a fusion system on S and let Q be a subgroup S such that\nQC F and AutF(Q) is a p-group. Then F = SCF(Q).\nProof. By (2.4), QC F implies that AutS(Q) \u2208 Sylp(AutF(Q)) and so, by assump-\ntion, AutS(Q) = AutF(Q). Thus, every morphism in F stably extends to Q and the\nrestriction to Q of each extension is induced by S-conjugation. \u0003\nDefinition 2.6. Let F be a fusion system on S. Motivated by Glauberman (cf. [6,\n\u00a73]), we define a conjugation family for F to be a set C of subgroups of S such\nthat any isomorphism in F can be written as a composition of F -isomorphisms\n\u03c6 : Q \u2212\u2192 Q\u2032 for which there exists R \u2208 C containing Q and Q\u2032 and an automorphism\n\u03b1 \u2208 AutF(R) such that \u03b1|Q = \u03c6.\nExamples of conjugation families include the set of fully F -normalized radical cen-\ntric subgroups of S (see [4, A.10]) and the fully F -normalized essential subgroups\nof S (this result is due to Puig; see [8, Theorem 5.2]). Though it varies in the litera-\nture, the fact that these are conjugation families is widely known as Alperin\u2019s fusion\ntheorem for fusion systems. Let us point out that the definition does not require\na conjugation family to be closed under F -isomorphisms (cf. Proposition 2.10),\nhowever any conjugation family for F contains S.\nDefinition 2.7. A subset A of S is weakly closed in S with respect to F if for any\nmorphism \u03d5 : \u3008A\u3009 \u2192 S, we have \u03d5(A) = A.\nThe next lemma shows that Z(F) is the set of weakly closed elements in S with\nrespect to F , justifying the convention of calling such elements central in F .\nLemma 2.8. Let F be a fusion system on S. The center Z(F) of F is the set\nof weakly closed elements in S with respect to F . In particular, if G is a fusion\nsubsystem of F on a subgroup T of S, then T \u2229 Z(F) \u2264 Z(G).\nProof. As Z(F) is central in F , every element of Z(F) is weakly closed in S with\nrespect to F . Conversely, suppose that x \u2208 S is weakly closed in S with respect to F\nand let Q \u2208 F frc. Then, x \u2208 Q since x \u2208 Z(S) and Q is F -centric. By assumption,\nany F -automorphism of Q is the identity on \u3008x\u3009 and so by Alperin\u2019s fusion theorem,\n\u3008x\u3009 \u2264 Z(F). \u0003\nLemma 2.9. Let F be a fusion system on S, and let Q and R be subgroups of S.\nIf Q is a characteristic subgroup of R, then NF(R) is a subcategory of NF(Q), i.e.,\nany morphism in F that stably extends to R also stably extends to Q.\nProof. Since Q is a characteristic subgroup of R, any morphism in NF(R) induces\nan automorphism of R and hence of Q. \u0003\nThe following proposition on conjugation families is well-known (and is used im-\nplicitly in [7]), but does not seem to occur formally in the literature. We thank\nProfessor Linckelmann for bringing it to our attention.\nGLAUBERMAN AND THOMPSON\u2019S THEOREMS FOR FUSION SYSTEMS 5\nProposition 2.10. Let F be a fusion system on S and let C be a conjugation family\nfor F . Any set of representatives for the F-isomorphism classes of subgroups in C\nis a conjugation family for F .\nProof. Let C \u2032 be a set of representatives for the F -isomorphism classes of subgroups\nin C. Let P \u2208 C and assume that P is not in C \u2032. In particular, P is a proper\nsubgroup of S. We need to show that any automorphism in AutF(P ) is contained\nin F(C \u2032) where F(C \u2032) is the subcategory of F on S with morphism sets given by the\ncomposition of restrictions of F -automorphisms of subgroups in C \u2032. By induction,\nwe assume that AutF(T ) \u2286 F(C \u2032) for all subgroups T \u2208 C properly containing\nP . Let P \u2032 \u2208 C \u2032 such that there exists an isomorphism \u03d5 \u2208 HomF(P, P \u2032). As C\nis a conjugation family, \u03d5 can be written as a composition of isomorphisms which\nextend to automorphisms of subgroups Q \u2208 C, necessarily larger than P and P \u2032.\nBy induction, each such isomorphism is the restriction of an isomorphism in F(C \u2032)\nand hence \u03d5 \u2208 F(C \u2032). Now take \u03c8 \u2208 AutF(P ) and set f = \u03d5 \u25e6 \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03d5\u22121 \u2208 AutF(P \u2032).\nConjugating by \u03d5\u22121, we get \u03c8 = \u03d5\u22121 \u25e6 f \u25e6 \u03d5 \u2208 F(C \u2032). \u0003\nAs in [7, Definition 1.2, 5.1], we make the following definitions.\nDefinition 2.11.\n(1) A positive characteristic p-functor W is a map sending any finite p-group Q\nto a characteristic subgroup W(Q) of Q such that\n(a) W(Q) 6= 1 if Q 6= 1;\n(b) if \u03d5 : Q \u2212\u2192 T is a group isomorphism, then \u03d5(W(Q)) = W(T ).\n(2) Let F be a fusion system on S and let W be a positive characteristic p-\nfunctor. For a subgroup Q of S, define W1(Q) = Q and for any positive\ninteger i, define Wi+1(Q) = W(NS(Wi(Q))). We say that Q is (F ,W)-well-\nplaced if Wi(Q) \u2208 F f for all positive integers i.\nCorollary 2.12. Let F be a fusion system on S and letW be a positive characteristic\np-functor. The (F ,W)-well-placed subgroups of S form a conjugation family for F .\nProof. Let C be any conjugation family for F . By [7, Proposition 5.2], every sub-\ngroup in C is F -isomorphic to an (F ,W)-well-placed subgroup of S. The result now\nfollows from Proposition 2.10. \u0003\nIn the next sections, we consider the positive characteristic p-functor J sending\na finite p-group S to its Thompson subgroup. For the sake of self-containment\nand clarity (there are at least three non-equivalent definitions for the Thompson\nsubgroup), we briefly recall its definition and state some of its useful properties. Let\nd(S) be the maximum of the orders of the abelian subgroups of S, and let A(S)\nbe the set of abelian subgroups of S of order d(S). Then the Thompson subgroup,\nJ(S), of S is defined by\nJ(S) = \u3008A | A \u2208 A(S)\u3009\nand satisfies the following properties:\n6 ANTONIO DI\u00b4AZ, ADAM GLESSER, NADIA MAZZA\u2020, AND SEJONG PARK\nIf A \u2208 A(S), then CS(A) = A; in particular, Z(S) \u2264 J(S).(2.13)\nd(J(S)) = d(S), A(J(S)) = A(S), J(J(S)) = J(S).(2.14)\nJ is a positive characteristic p-functor.(2.15)\nFinally, we recall what it means for a fusion system F to be H-free for some finite\ngroup H. A group G is H-free if there are no subgroups K,L of G, with L E K and\nK\/L \u223c= H. Now, for an arbitrary fusion system F on S, we appeal to [3, Proposition\n4.3]. That is, to any Q \u2208 F fc, there corresponds, up to isomorphism, a unique\nfinite group LFQ having NS(Q) as Sylow p-subgroup, such that CLFQ(Q) = Z(Q) and\nNF(Q) = FNS(Q)(LFQ).\nDefinition 2.16. Let F be a fusion system on S and let H be a finite group. Then\nF is H-free if LFQ is H-free for all Q \u2208 F fc.\nRemark 2.17. Let F be a fusion system on S.\n(1) By [7, Proposition 6.1], if LFQ is H-free for all Q \u2208 F frc, then F is H-free.\nHence, Definition 2.16 is equivalent to [7, Definition 1.1].\n(2) If F has a normal centric subgroup Q, then F is said to be constrained. In\nthis case [3, Proposition 4.3] implies that there is a finite group G with Sylow\np-subgroup S such that CG(Q) = Z(Q) and F = FS(G).\n3. Glauberman and Thompson\u2019s Theorems for Finite Groups\nIn this section, we recall two classical theorems, one of Glauberman and one of\nThompson, as presented in [6]. Firstly, [6, Theorem 14.10] states:\nTheorem G (Glauberman, 1969). Let G be a finite group and S be a Sylow p-\nsubgroup of G. Suppose that x \u2208 S \u2229 Z(NG(J(S))) and that\n(a) p is odd, or\n(b) x \u2208 (Z(S))p, or\n(c) G is S4-free.\nThen x is weakly closed in S with respect to G.\nGlauberman uses this theorem, along with [6, Lemma 4.5], to prove [6, Theo-\nrem 14.11], a slightly stronger version of a theorem of Thompson (cf. [12]).\nTheorem T (Thompson, 1964). Let G be a finite group and let S be a Sylow p-\nsubgroup of G. Suppose that p is odd or that G is S4-free. If CG(Z(S)) and NG(J(S))\nare both p-nilpotent, then G is p-nilpotent.\nNote that [6, Lemma 4.5] also generalizes to fusion systems but we leave it as an\nexercise for the reader since it is not needed to prove the fusion system version of\nTheorem T.\nGLAUBERMAN AND THOMPSON\u2019S THEOREMS FOR FUSION SYSTEMS 7\n4. Glauberman and Thompson\u2019s Theorems for Fusion Systems\nIn this section, we prove the fusion system analogues of Theorem G and Theorem T.\nTheorem 4.1. Let F be a fusion system on S. Then (Z(S))p\u2229Z(NF(J(S))) \u2264 Z(F).\nFurthermore, if p is odd or F is S4-free, then Z(F) = Z(NF(J(S))).\nProof. Suppose that the theorem is false and take a counterexample F with minimal\nnumber |F| of morphisms. We shall show that F is constrained. That is, there\nexists an F -centric subgroup of S that is normal in F . For then F = FS(G) for\nsome finite group G having S as a Sylow p-subgroup. Assuming we have done this,\nlet x \u2208 Z(NF(J(S))) = Z(NG(J(S))). Suppose that p is odd, or F is S4-free, or\nx \u2208 (Z(S))p. If F is S4-free, then so is G. By Theorem G, it follows that x is weakly\nclosed in S with respect to G, i.e. x \u2208 Z(F), a contradiction. This will prove the\ntheorem.\nSince F is a counterexample, if p is odd or F is S4-free, then we may choose an\nelement x \u2208 S that is central in NF(J(S)) but not in F ; otherwise choose x \u2208 (Z(S))p\nsuch that x is central in NF(J(S)) but not in F . Note that x \u2208 Z(NF(J(S))) \u2264 Z(S).\nIt follows that if x \u2208 T for a subgroup T of S, then x \u2208 Z(T ) and hence x \u2208 J(T )\nby (2.13). Let C be the conjugation family for F consisting of the (F , J)-well-placed\nsubgroups of S. Observe that if Q \u2208 C then J(NS(Q)) \u2208 C. There exist a subgroup\nQ \u2208 C containing x and a morphism \u03d5 \u2208 AutF(Q) such that \u03d5(x) 6= x; that is,\nx \/\u2208 Z(NF(Q)). Let\nJ = {D \u2208 C | x \u2208 D = J(D), x \/\u2208 Z(NF(D))}.\nWe claim that J 6= \u2205. Suppose that J(NS(Q)) \/\u2208 J . Clearly J(J(NS(Q))) =\nJ(NS(Q)) and since x \u2208 NS(Q) we have x \u2208 J(NS(Q)). Thus x \u2208 Z(NF(J(NS(Q)))).\nNext we show that for any subgroup D \u2208 C,\n(4.2) if x \/\u2208 Z(NF(D)) and x \u2208 Z(NF(J(NS(D)))), then D C F .\nSet G = NF(D), a fusion subsystem of F on NS(D). Then NG(J(NS(D))) is a fusion\nsubsystem of NF(J(NS(D))) on NS(D). By Lemma 2.8, x \u2208 Z(NF(J(NS(D)))) \u2229\nNS(D) \u2264 Z(NG(J(NS(D)))). But x \/\u2208 Z(G) and so Z(G) < Z(NG(J(NS(D)))). Fur-\nthermore, if x \u2208 (Z(S))p, then x \u2208 (Z(NS(D)))p. By the minimality of |F|, we have\nF = G = NF(D), i.e. D C F , which proves (4.2). This shows for Q as above that\nQCF and then by Lemma 2.9, we get J(Q)CF . Thus, J(Q) \u2208 J . This shows that\nJ 6= \u2205.\nChoose D \u2208 J such that D is maximal with respect to inclusion and such that\nd(D) is maximal. Observe that this assumption along with (2.14) implies that if\nD \u2264 E such that J(E) \u2208 J , then\n(4.3) d(D) = d(J(E)) = d(E)\nand\n(4.4) A(D) \u2264 A(E) which implies that D = J(D) \u2264 J(E).\nWe shall show that D is an F -centric subgroup of S that is normal in F . First\nwe show that x \u2208 Z(NF(J(NS(D)))). Suppose that x \/\u2208 Z(NF(J(NS(D)))). Then\nJ(NS(D)) \u2208 J because x \u2208 NS(D) implies that x \u2208 J(NS(D)). So, by (4.4),\n8 ANTONIO DI\u00b4AZ, ADAM GLESSER, NADIA MAZZA\u2020, AND SEJONG PARK\nD \u2264 J(NS(D)). The maximality of D with respect to inclusion in J implies that\nD = J(NS(D)). Consequently,\nNS(D) \u2264 NS(NS(D)) \u2264 NS(J(NS(D))) = NS(D),\nwhich yields NS(D) = S and J(S) \u2208 J , contradicting the original assumption that\nx \u2208 Z(NF(J(S))). Therefore, (4.2) implies that D C F .\nFinally, we show that D is F -centric. Since D C F , it suffices to show that\nCS(D) \u2264 D. First, we claim that J(DCS(D)) \u2208 J . Indeed, J(DCS(D)) \u2208 C since\nJ(DCS(D)) is normal in S. Also, x \u2208 J(DCS(D)) since x \u2208 D. Thus, it remains to\nshow that x 6\u2208 Z(NF(J(DCS(D)))). By Lemmas 2.8 and 2.9, Z(NF(J(DCS(D)))) \u2264\nZ(NF(DCS(D))), and so it suffices to show that x 6\u2208 Z(NF(DCS(D))). Suppose that\nx \u2208 Z(NF(DCS(D))) and let \u03d5 \u2208 HomF(\u3008x\u3009, S). Since D \/F and x \u2208 D, \u03d5 extends\nto an F -automorphism of D. Moreover, by the extension axiom, this automorphism\nextends to an F -automorphism of DCS(D). Hence \u03d5 \u2208 NF(DCS(D)) and \u03d5(x) = x.\nThis implies that x \u2208 Z(F), a contradiction. Consequently, J(DCS(D)) \u2208 J .\nThus, by (4.3), we get d(D) = d(J(DCS(D))). Let A \u2208 A(D), y \u2208 CS(D). Then\n|\u3008A, y\u3009| \u2264 d(DCS(D)) = d(D) = |A|, so y \u2208 A. Thus CS(D) \u2264 D and hence D is\nF -centric. \u0003\nTheorem 4.5. Let F be a fusion system on S. Assume that p is odd or that F is\nS4-free. If CF(Z(S)) = NF(J(S)) = FS(S), then F = FS(S).\nProof. By Theorem 4.1, we have Z(F) = Z(NF(J(S))) = Z(FS(S)) = Z(S). Hence,\nF = CF(Z(S)) = FS(S). \u0003\nThe following corollary strengthens Frobenius\u2019 theorem for fusion systems (see [8,\nTheorem 3.11]) when p is odd or the fusion system is S4-free. The proof mimics\nthat of Thompson in [12] where he only considers the case where p is odd.\nCorollary 4.6. Let F be a fusion system on S. Assume that p is odd or that F is\nS4-free. The following are equivalent:\n(1) F = FS(S).\n(2) AutF(Q) is a p-group for every nontrivial characteristic subgroup Q of S.\n(3) NF(Q) = FS(S) for every nontrivial characteristic subgroup Q of S.\nProof. It is immediate from the definitions that (1) implies (2). Assume that (2)\nimplies (3) does not hold and let F be a minimal counterexample. Fix a nontrivial\ncharacteristic subgroup Q of S such that NF(Q) 6= FS(S). If F is S4-free, then\nby [7, Proposition 6.3, 6.4], NF(Q)\/Q is S4-free. Also, if I is any subgroup of S\ncontaining Q and such that I\/Q is characteristic in S\/Q, then I is characteristic\nin S. This shows that AutNF (Q)\/Q(I\/Q) is a p-group and so the hypotheses of (2)\nhold for the fusion system NF(Q)\/Q. By the minimality of F , we conclude that\nNF(Q)\/Q = FS\/Q(S\/Q) = FS(S)\/Q. Now, by Lemma 2.5, NF(Q) = NNF (Q)(Q) =\nSCNF (Q)(Q) = SCF(Q). Then [7, Proposition 3.4] implies that NF(Q) = FS(S), a\ncontradiction. Therefore, (2) implies (3). Finally, if we specialize Q to be Z(S) and\nJ(S) in (3), we get NF(J(S)) = FS(S) = CF(Z(S)) and by Theorem 4.5, F = FS(S).\nThus, (3) implies (1). \u0003\nGLAUBERMAN AND THOMPSON\u2019S THEOREMS FOR FUSION SYSTEMS 9\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors are sincerely grateful to R.
