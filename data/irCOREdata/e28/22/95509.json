New Zealand has a simple pension system \nthrough choice, not constraint. \n \n \n \nReforming pensions:  \nPrinciples, analytical errors and policy directions1\n \nNicholas Barr2 and Peter Diamond3\n \nThis article summarizes the central analytics and policy conclusions of Barr and Diamond \n(2008) (and a forthcoming shorter version). The books have two roots. First, we were \nmembers of a small group asked by the government of China to review their pension system \nand write a report that could help to improve policy discussion. Our report to Prime Minister \nWen Jiabao in 2004 (Asher et al. 2005) is available online.4 The other root is our role as peer \nreviewers of a World Bank study (Holzmann and Hinz 2005), whose analysis we regard as \nincomplete.  \n This article starts with the relevant economic theory, addressing core analytical \nprinciples and some lamentably common analytical errors. Part 2 discusses implications for \npolicy.  \n A central argument is that the primary cause of the pensions \u2018crisis\u2019 in many countries \nis a failure to adapt to very long-run trends: increasing life expectancy (with some sad \nexceptions), declining fertility, and earlier retirement.5 Superimposed are two more recent \nphenomena: the baby boom (widespread, though not universal) and the general increase in \nthe scale of pension systems. Reform to address financing issues can also be an occasion to \nimprove pension design. \nPension systems with contribution rates, monthly benefits, and retirement ages set for \nan earlier era are not consistent with the longer retirements implied by increasing life \nexpectancy, earlier average retirement and the additional rise in dependency rates implied by \ndeclining fertility. Some adjustment is necessary, and would be even without the baby boom, \ngiven the striking similarity in age pyramids projected for 2050 for China (which has a one-\n                                                 \n1 We wish to thank all the people we thanked in the preface to our book from which this paper is drawn. \n2 Professor of Public Economics, London School of Economics and Political Science; Email: N.Barr@lse.ac.uk.  \n3 Institute Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Email: pdiamond@mit.edu.  \n4 http:\/\/www.oup.com\/us\/pdf\/social_security_study_2005\n5 The long-term trend to earlier retirement has attenuated or reversed in a number of countries. But we have not \nseen a trend in the other direction proportional to continuing increase in life expectancy. Thus there is still an \nongoing trend to earlier retirement in percentage terms.  \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 1   ISSR December 2008 \nchild policy6), the United States, which had a baby boom, and India, which had neither (Barr \nand Diamond 2008, Fig. 1.5). The main source of financing problems is that, apart from \nadjustment to price and wage growth, traditional defined-benefit (DB) systems have had a \nstatic design with no automatic adjustment to demographic trends.  This problem is not \ninherent: a defined benefit system can be designed to adjust automatically to demographic \nvariables, as shown by the recent reform in Germany.  With funded and notional defined \ncontribution systems (DC, NDC, see Box 1) the problem is different: both systems adjust \nbenefit levels to available finances. With given contribution rates and ages of earliest access \nto retirement benefits, the problem is not sustainability but the possibility of inadequate \nbenefit levels.  \nBox 1  Terminology \nContributory basic pension. A pension paid, often at a flat rate, to a person with a full record \nof contributions, or pro rata to a person with an incomplete contributions record. \nDefined-benefit (DB) pensions. A pension in which the benefit is determined as a function of \nthe worker\u2019s history of pensionable earnings. The formula may be based on the worker\u2019s final wage \nand length of service, or on wages over a longer period, for example the worker\u2019s full career. A DB \nsystem may be fully or partially funded, or unfunded. In a pure DB arrangement the sponsor\u2019s \ncontributions are adjusted to meet obligations. Insofar as the degree of funding is maintained, \ncontributions are adjusted to meet anticipated obligations; thus the risk of varying rates of return to \npension assets falls on the sponsor.  \nDefined-contribution (DC) pensions. A pension in which the benefit is determined by the \nvalue of assets accumulated toward a person\u2019s pension. Benefits may be taken as a lump sum, as a \nsequence of withdrawals, or by purchase of an annuity. Thus the expected discounted value of \nbenefits is equal to the value of assets, referred to as benefits being determined actuarially.7 Thus, a \npure DC plan adjusts obligations to match available funds, so that the individual bears the portfolio \nrisk.  \nFully funded pensions pay all benefits from accumulated funds. Partially-funded pensions pay \nbenefits both from accumulated assets and from current contributions.  \nA noncontributory universal pension is based on years of residence. \nNotional defined-contribution (NDC) pensions are financed on a pay-as-you-go or partially \nfunded basis, with a person\u2019s pension bearing a quasi-actuarial relationship to his or her lifetime \npension contributions.  \n                                                 \n6 The policy has significant exceptions. The current total fertility rate is 1.8 and the rate has never been close to \n1. \n7 The discounted value depends on the relevant interest rate and load factors. \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 2   ISSR December 2008 \nPay-as-you-go (PAYG) pensions. PAYG pensions are paid out of current revenue (usually by \nthe state, from tax revenue) rather than out of accumulated funds. Partially-funded pensions are often \nreferred to as PAYG. \n \n1 Principles \n1.1 Principles of analysis \nEconomic theory suggests a number of conclusions about pensions. \nPension systems have multiple objectives. The major objectives of individuals and \nfamilies are consumption smoothing and insurance. Governments have additional goals, \nincluding poverty relief and redistribution. Analysis needs to take account of all these \nobjectives alongside other goals, such as economic efficiency and output growth.  \nAnalysis should consider the pension system as a whole. Pension design affects the \nlabour market, economic growth, the distribution of risk, and the distribution of income, \nincluding by generation and gender. Analyses of those effects need to consider the entire \npension system, and in particular whether a change in one part needs to be accompanied by a \nchange in another. There is no efficiency gain from designing one part of the system without \ndistortions if distortions are then placed elsewhere to accomplish insurance and redistributive \ngoals. Hence there is no gain from obsessing about an actuarial second-tier pension given the \nneed for a poverty-relief element in the first tier. What is relevant for analysis is the \ncombined effect of the whole system. Similarly, analysis of distributional effects should \nconsider the progressivity of the system as a whole, rather than that of each element. \nConsider, for example, a universal flat-rate pension financed by a proportional tax; although \nthe tax side, considered alone, is not progressive, the system overall is.  \nAnalysis should be framed in a second-best context. Simple theory assumes that \nindividuals make optimal choices and that labour markets, savings institutions, and insurance \nmarkets exist and function ideally. Formulating policy within that first-best framework is \nanalytically simple, but a bad guide to pension design in a world with limited policy tools and \nmajor market imperfections, as discussed in Boxes 2 and 3. \nBox 2 Deviations from first-best \nIn the theory of saving in a first-best world the individual is assumed to make choices about saving, \nborrowing, portfolio choice and annuitisation that maximize his or her lifetime utility from a complete \narray of competitively-priced market options. In those circumstances, consumer choice and \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 3   ISSR December 2008 \ncompetitive markets maximize welfare, given lump sum redistribution. Pensions, however, face a \nnumber of serious deviations from such a theoretical world. \nImperfect information. Optimal use of markets requires people to understand the uncertainties \nthey face and the options that markets offer. In fact, individuals are imperfectly informed in several \nways: \n\u2022 Some individuals have a poor sense of the risks and uncertainties they face, for example about \nfuture benefits from defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans. \n\u2022 Many individuals do not understand basic concepts in finance: Orszag and Stiglitz (2001, p. \n37) quote the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as stating that over \n50 percent of Americans did not know the difference between a stock and a bond. The \nproblem also has distributional implications, as information poverty and financial poverty are \nhighly correlated.  \n\u2022 Defined-benefit plans are complex, and typically incompletely understood. With corporate \nplans, labour mobility, changes to the plan and financial problems of the firm have \nimplications for pensions that can be hard to see. Complexity is often a problem with public \nsystems as well.  \n\u2022 Information processing problems arise when the problem is too complex for many agents, \neven when they are provided with the necessary information. Such problems are more likely \nwhere the time horizon is long, the outcome involves complex probabilities, or the details are \ninherently complex, all of which characterize most pension products. Advice can be \nexpensive and inadequate. \nFor these and other reasons, poor decisions give a justification for compulsion, and the simple \nassumption of rational utility maximization is not a good basis for pension policy design.  \nIncomplete markets. Actual markets are limited in their ability to provide competitively-\npriced products that match the needs and wants of even a well-informed consumer. In the case of \nretirement income, the market for indexed contracts is thin. Asymmetric information in insurance \nmarkets makes perfect insurance impossible; and when insurance is provided through employment, \nlabour market decisions may be distorted. Insurance firms must cope with potential consumers with \ndifferent risks and so different costs, and may design products in response to poor consumer decision \nmaking. The problem of adverse selection can be eased by making insurance mandatory. Generally, \nmarketing insurance products is highly costly; thus government provision of a uniform product may \nhave much lower cost. \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 4   ISSR December 2008 \nProgressive taxation is a further deviation from first-best. In comparing defined-contribution \nand defined-benefit plans, it is not possible to say that one approach dominates the other if labour \nmarket distortions are present:  \n\u201cWith a progressive annual income tax and age-earnings profiles that are generally increasing in \nreal terms, the marginal income tax rate is rising with age, on average. Thus, a well-designed DB \nsystem may well have better labour market outcomes since the overall tax burden, income tax \nplus net tax from social security, will vary less over the life-cycle. That is, income taxes are lower \non the young and net social security taxes are higher. Therefore, without a detailed calculation, \none cannot reach an efficiency conclusion.\u201d (Diamond 2002, p. 57). \nAll these deviations from first-best call into question the simple model of market choice and \ncompetition. Some resulting problems with the exercise of consumer choice are taken up in Box 3.  \n \nBox 3 Do consumers choose well? Lessons from behavioural economics \nA recent and growing literature on behavioural economics documents poor choices that come from \npoor decision making (see U.K. Pensions Commission 2004, pp. 207-10, and Tapia and Yermo 2007).  \n  Many people do not save enough voluntarily to maximize lifetime utility, and few buy \nannuities voluntarily despite their considerable value. People may fail to choose, or delay doing so: \n\u2022 Procrastination: People delay saving, do not save, or do not save enough. People agree that \nthey should save more for retirement but postpone the action itself (Choi et al. 2001).   \n\u2022 Avoiding explicit choice: With rational choice, it should make no difference whether \nindividuals face an opt-in or an opt-out provision; in practice, automatic enrolment leads to \nmuch higher participation. Participation rates in employer 401(k) plans in the United States \ndiffer sharply depending on whether or not enrolment was automatic with an opt-out \n(Beshears et al. 2008). \n\u2022 Immobilization: Complexity and conflicting information can lead to passive behavior. A \nlarger range of 401(k) options can result in less participation. A large fraction of new workers \nin Sweden, able to choose from over 700 mutual funds, make no choice at all.  \n In addition, when people do choose, their choices may make little sense: \n\u2022 Short-term gratification: Many people retire at the earliest age permitted, which may be too \nearly for their own good or that of their spouses. In the United States a much larger spike in \nretirements occurs at age 62 than seems sensible given that the increase in pension for later \nretirement is roughly actuarially fair for the average worker.  \n\u2022 Framing: Choices are influenced by how they are presented, even at the simplest level. As \nLoewenstein and Ubel (2008, p. 1806) note: \u201cpeople who learn first about the risks of a \ntreatment followed by its benefits make different choices than people who first learn about its \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 5   ISSR December 2008 \nbenefits and then its risks. Decision aid developers have no choice but to present information \nin one order or another, but unfortunately the order they choose will almost inevitably affect \npeople\u2019s decisions.\u201d \n\u2022 Familiarity: Another poor but common choice is to invest heavily in the stock of one\u2019s own \nemployer; if the firm goes bankrupt, employees invested in the firm lose both their wage \nincome and much of their capital accumulation, as happened to many employees of Enron. \nSuch behavior shows a failure to understand the benefits of diversifying risk. \n\u2022 Excessive trading: many people appear to trade too much, on average worsening their position \non the risk-return frontier while also incurring trading costs. Some try to time the market, \nmoving between classes of assets in a way that increases risk relative to expected return, and \nindeed seems to lower the expected return on average as well. \nRecent experimental evidence supports a tendency in some circumstances for people to have a \nhigher discount rate in the short run (that is, a tendency to instant gratification) and a lower one in the \nmedium term. The problem is that when the future arrives, it becomes the present; hence short-term \ngratification continues, and can result in time-inconsistency. \nThese findings suggest a number of implications for policy design in employer and public \nplans: \n\u2022 Keep choices simple, for example by offering only a small number of clearly differentiated \nfunds. \n\u2022 Use automatic enrolment, thus turning inertia to the individual\u2019s advantage: once \nautomatically enrolled, most people will stay with the plan. \n\u2022 Design a good default option: an arrangement based on automatic enrolment plus worker \nchoice of plans requires a default option for workers who do not make a choice. The existence \nand design of the default option are important (see Beshears et al. 2008 for fuller discussion). \n\u2022 In voluntary plans a further option is to allow people to commit now to (reversible) action in \nthe future, thus making use of procrastination to assist policy. People are happy to promise to \nsave more in the future, as in the \u201cSave More Tomorrow\u201d plan of Thaler and Benartzi (2004). \nFor the reasons set out in Boxes 2 and 3, progress in helping consumers to become \nbetter informed has been limited even in developed countries. People often fail to make \nchoices that maximize their long-term well-being or that of their families, and often make no \nexplicit choice at all\u2014a common result where excessive choice or excessive complexity \nbecomes overwhelming.  In contrast with simple theory, offering people a restricted set of \nchoices can at times improve outcomes; it is also critical to design good defaults for people \nwho make no explicit choice.  \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 6   ISSR December 2008 \nAlongside problems in choosing among pension products, consumers also face \nproblems in choosing the timing of retirement. If pension benefits bear an actuarial \nrelationship to a person\u2019s expected duration of retirement, longer lives and retirement at an \nunchanged earliest possible age (a common occurrence) inescapably aggravate elderly \npoverty. The concern that some people are retiring too early for their own good and that of \ntheir spouses matters for choice of an earliest entitlement age and increases the importance of \ncareful design of the incentives to work beyond the earliest entitlement age.  \nIn addition to problems with individual choice, analysis needs to take account of the \nother deviations from first-best set out in Box 2, notably incomplete markets and taxation.  \nFraming the argument in second-best terms starts from the multiple objectives of \npension systems, which cannot all be achieved fully at the same time. Thus policy has to \noptimize\u2014not minimize or maximize\u2014across a range of objectives. To illustrate, an \nexclusive focus on consumption smoothing suggests a system in which benefits bear a fairly \nexact relationship to a worker\u2019s accumulated contributions; but such a system would fail to \nrelieve old-age poverty for low-paid workers and would not offer insurance against adverse \nlabour market outcomes. Thus policy has to seek the best balance among consumption \nsmoothing, poverty relief, and insurance, a balance that will depend in each society on the \nweights given to those and other objectives. \nDifferent systems share risks differently. In a pure system of funded individual \naccounts, the risk of unsatisfactory outcomes (apart from the longevity risk, if benefits are \ntaken as an annuity) is imposed on the individual worker. The allocation of risk in the pure \ncase can be altered by government guarantees or government bailouts. In a pure, employer \nprovided defined-benefit arrangement, the risk in paying benefit amounts according to \nformula is borne by the employer, unless there is bankruptcy. The employer may spread the \nrisk across current and future workers, insofar as wages adjust, across shareholders, as profits \ndecline, and across customers if the costs of a deficit fall partly on prices; hence the risk is \nshared more broadly.8 This allocation, too, can be altered by government insurance or \nbailouts. In a pure Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) defined-benefit system financed out of \nmandatory social insurance contributions (e. g., through payroll taxes), risks are shared across \ncontributors, that is, across the current working generation. The allocation in the pure PAYG \ncase can be altered by adjusting benefits and, through variations in partial funding or \nborrowing, by transferring risks across generations, through adjustments of contributions or \n                                                 \n8 Anticipated (as opposed to accrued) pension benefits are subject to revision of the pension formula. \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 7   ISSR December 2008 \nbenefits. Finally, in a system financed out of general revenue as well as, or in place of, \ncontributions, the risks are shared across all taxpayers, and hence across generations (since \nfuture taxes as well as current taxes can change as debt varies). Thus \u2013 crucially \u2013 a system \nwith a PAYG element allows intergenerational risk sharing; this does not happen in a fully \nfunded system of individual accounts.  \nThe level of funding affects intergenerational distribution. As discussed further \nbelow, funding that affects savings affects the intergenerational distribution of resources. To \nevaluate such a policy one needs to evaluate the relative positions of different generations in \nterms of the levels of their wages and their mortality and morbidity rates. \nDifferent systems affect men and women differently. Pension systems, like other \ninstitutions, create incentives that affect decisions about paid work, care activities, and \nleisure. They also affect the income flows to men and women, both when married and when a \nsurviving or divorced spouse. Analysis needs to reflect diversity in social values, individual \npreferences, and economic situations within a country and across countries.  \n1.2 Analytical errors:  The World Bank and other culprits \nDiscussion of pensions is prone to analytical errors of which the following\u2014some by \nthe World Bank, but certainly not only the World Bank\u2014are prime examples. It is important \nto be clear that these errors are not based on different value judgments or different views \nabout empirical magnitudes \u2013 they are examples of flawed analysis. \nTunnel vision. Analysis that focuses, often implicitly, on a single objective such as \nconsumption smoothing may be flawed because it pays inadequate attention to other \nobjectives such as poverty relief and gender balance.  \nSimilarly, it is generally mistaken to consider one part of the pension system in \nisolation, ignoring the effects of other parts. There is no efficiency gain from moving \nredistribution from one part of the system to another, even if the change leaves one part with \nno deviation from full actuarial principles. \nImproper use of first-best analysis. It is a mistake to focus on the labour market \ndistortions caused by a given set of pension arrangements while ignoring or downplaying the \ncontributions of those arrangements to the various goals of pension systems\u2014contributions \nthat are not available without distortions. A pension system that includes poverty relief will \nbe distorting;  minimizing distortions implies minimizing poverty relief \u2013 the cure is worse \nthan the disease. Any optimal program will necessarily induce distortions \u2013 starting from an \nefficient laissez-faire allocation, distortions create second-order efficiency costs but first-\nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 8   ISSR December 2008 \norder distributional gains. The argument that an actuarial relationship between contributions \nand benefits is optimal in terms of labour market effects is generally mistaken for second-best \nreasons. Of course pensions should be designed to avoid larger distortions than are justified \nby their contribution to goals, but it follows that minimizing distortions is not the right \nobjective. \nAlso mistaken is uncritical acceptance of the argument that competition among \npension providers benefits consumers by increasing choice and driving down administrative \ncharges. Although widely applicable in many markets, this line of argument understates the \nserious problems of information and decision making in pensions discussed in Boxes 2 and 3. \nThese problems do not mean that there should be no consumer choice, but rather that options \nshould be carefully designed, for example through adequate incentives for delayed retirement \nand constrained choice and well-crafted defaults for the choice of assets. Competition \nincludes selling efforts as well as competition on price and quality. \nImproper use of steady-state analysis. It is mistaken to focus on the design of a \nreformed pension system in a steady state while ignoring or underplaying the steps that are \nnecessary to get to that steady state. This issue becomes especially important when \nconsidering whether or not to move from PAYG toward funded pensions, as discussed more \nfully in Box 4. A related error is the claim that funding is inherently superior because stock \nmarket returns exceed the rate of wage growth; that claim is mistaken for several reasons, not \nleast because it takes no account of how the move to funding is to be financed. \n \nBox 4 What are we comparing with what? \nIn assessing proposals for pension reform, it is important to be clear what question is being asked. \nFeldstein (2005), for example, argues that the U.S. Social Security system has reduced national \nsaving. A key question is what normative conclusion to draw. U.S. Social Security is less than fully \nfunded because benefits were paid to earlier cohorts in excess of what their contributions could have \nfinanced. The purpose of paying higher benefits was to raise the consumption of those cohorts after \nretirement, and (short-run Keynesian issues aside) this inevitably reduced national saving. Thus the \ndecline in national saving was not an avoidable side effect of poorly designed policy but a necessary \nconsequence of the policy of increasing the consumption of earlier retirees. \nIf one does not include the value to earlier generations of the consumption that resulted from \nlower investment, the analysis implicitly makes a long-run comparison; that is, it compares the \neconomic situation in the United States today with what it would have been in an alternative long run \nwith funded pensions. Thus the underlying question is: How does welfare in long-run state B differ \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 9   ISSR December 2008 \nfrom that in long run state A? For a policy choice the appropriate analysis asks a different question: \nWhat are the welfare effects of moving from state A to state B? Either question (and its related \nanswer) is coherent. What is not legitimate is to take the answer to one question and apply it to the \nother. \n \nIncomplete analysis of implicit pension debt. Analysis that looks only at future \nliabilities (that is, future pension payments), while ignoring explicit assets and the implicit \nasset from the government\u2019s ability to levy taxes, is misleading. Too narrow a focus on costs \nalso ignores the considerable improvement in people\u2019s well-being from increased old-age \nsecurity. Just as public debt never needs to be fully paid off so long as the debt-to-GDP ratio \ndoes not get too large, so publicly provided pensions need not be fully funded, as long as the \nunfunded obligations are not growing excessively relative to the contributions base. A related \nerror is to treat implicit and explicit debt as equivalent: they are not since the politics of \nchanging the real values of the two debts are different, and bond markets understandably treat \nthem differently.  \nIncomplete analysis of the effects of funding. This error appears in a number of \nguises. \n1) Excessive focus on financial flows: housing aside, a pensioner\u2019s living standard in \nold age will depend on his or her ability to consume goods and services produced by younger \nworkers. PAYG and funding are both ways of organizing claims on that output. It is therefore \nmistaken to focus excessively on how pensions are financed while ignoring future national \noutput and its division between workers and pensioners. The error in this focus is its failure to \nrecognize that the effects of funding on future output will depend on the answers to a series \nof questions, many of which are often addressed incompletely or ignored: \n\u2022 Will funding pensions increase saving? \n\u2022 Is increased saving a good objective? \n\u2022 Will funded pensions strengthen the performance of capital markets? \n\u2022 If so, is it necessary for this purpose that pensions are mandatory? \n\u2022 Are redistributive effects across generations\u2014which are inevitable\u2014desirable policy? \nWe return to the discussion of the desirability, or otherwise, of funding in the policy \ndiscussion below. A common example of this error is to argue that with funded defined-\ncontribution accounts little action is needed to adjust to demographic change. Longer lives in \nretirement reduce monthly benefits for given accumulations and so, it is argued, there is no \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 10   ISSR December 2008 \nfinancing problem. But that does not mean that there is no social problem \u2013 in this case, \ninadequate benefits \u2013 particularly if retirement ages do not change much. \n2) Failure to consider how funding is generated: one way to increase funding is to \nincrease contribution rates (or reduce benefits) now in order to have lower contribution rates \nor higher benefits in the future; another is to place assets with the pension authority rather \nthan hold them elsewhere. The first approach can raise national saving, and thus output, and \nso enhance the capacity to provide benefits in the future. The central point is very simple: to \nraise national saving, changes to pension arrangements have to lower someone\u2019s \nconsumption, either that of workers, if contributions are increased, or that of retirees, if \nbenefits are reduced. A transfer of assets does not have that effect if the assets would have \nbeen saved anyway. It does not create additional output, but only changes the distribution of \nthe burden of paying for benefits, including benefits that are a legacy of an older pension \nsystem.  \n 3) Improper focus on trust fund assets: despite claims that holding government bonds \nis not useful, the type of asset in a trust fund is not informative of the impact of trust fund \nactivity on the ability of government to finance benefits, as two examples show. If the \ngovernment raises contribution rates to buy (and then hold) government debt that would \notherwise be sold to the public, the government is in a better financial position, even though \nthe assets in the pension trust fund are the government\u2019s own bonds. In contrast, if the \ngovernment issues additional debt to finance a purchase of stocks, the government is not in a \nbetter financial position, even though the assets are private assets.  \nIgnoring distributional effects. Because pension systems can redistribute across \ncohorts with different birth years, it is necessary to consider who gains and who loses. An \negregious error is to ignore the fact that any choice between funding and PAYG necessarily \nmakes choices about redistribution across generations. The point is most obvious if \npolicymakers are establishing a brand new pension system. If they introduce a PAYG system, \nthe first generation of retirees receives a pension, but returns to subsequent generations are \nlower; if they fully fund, later generations benefit from higher returns, but the first generation \nreceives little or no pension. Thus it is mistaken to present the gain to pensioners in later \ngenerations as a Pareto improvement9, since it comes at the expense of the first generation. \nThe same argument applies in a country that already has a PAYG system: a policy to move \n                                                 \n9 A situation is described as Pareto efficient if resources are allocated in such a way that no reallocation can \nmake any individual better off without making at least one other individual worse off.  A policy that makes \nsomeone better off and nobody worse off is referred to as Pareto improving. \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 11   ISSR December 2008 \ntoward funding through higher contributions or lower benefits redistributes from current \ngenerations to future ones.  \nWhatever the merits of a potential move towards funding, the error in ignoring \ndistributional effects is profound: it makes an implicit assumption about the distribution of \nincome across generations; it leads to mistaken claims for the Pareto superiority of some \npolicies; and it ignores the fact that a PAYG element in a pension system is generally welfare \nenhancing because of the resulting possibility of intergenerational risk sharing (see, for \nexample, Dutta, Kapur and Orszag 2000). \nAll of these analytical errors matter. They matter not because they offend our logical \naesthetics, but because analytical errors lead to policy errors, many of which are identified in \na World Bank evaluation of its own pensions work (World Bank 2006a, b). \n2 Implications for policy  \nWhat do these theoretical arguments imply for policy? Successive sections consider general \naspects of pension design, finance and funding, and implementation.  \n2.1 Pension design \nThere is no single best pension design. Proper application of the principles above can \nand does lead to widely different systems. The simple but important argument is set out in \nBox 5. \nBox 5  No single best pension system \nPensions have multiple objectives, notably the achievement of consumption smoothing, insurance, \npoverty relief and redistribution. \n The pursuit of these objectives faces a series of constraints: \n\u2022 Fiscal capacity: stronger fiscal capacity makes it easier for the system to find additional \nrevenues for a pension system.  \n\u2022 Institutional capacity: stronger institutional capacity makes feasible a wider range of options \nfor pension design.  \n\u2022 The empirical value of behavioural parameters, such as the responsiveness of labour supply to \nthe design of the pension system, and the effect of pensions on private saving. \n\u2022 The shape of the pre-transfer income distribution: a heavier lower tail of the income \ndistribution increases the need for poverty relief.  \n There is no single best system for several reasons: \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 12   ISSR December 2008 \n\u2022 Policy makers will attach different relative weights to the objectives, including views about \nthe importance of poverty relief and about how risks should be shared within and across \ngenerations. \n\u2022 The pattern of constraints, including the value of key parameters, will differ across countries.  \n\u2022 Political processes, which vary across countries, affect what is politically feasible, given the \nrange of alternatives that are economically and administratively feasible. \n\u2022 History provides a set of institutions which influence the value and politics of change. \n \nThus is it not surprising that countries have successfully implemented very different \npension systems.10 Countries have chosen systems that vary from more or less pure \nconsumption smoothing, in the form of mandatory saving with little or no insurance (e.g. \nSingapore\u2019s publicly administered provident fund, which is in essence a savings plan), to a \nprimary concern for poverty relief, achieved through a noncontributory flat-rate pension, with \nconsumption smoothing on a voluntary basis (as in New Zealand). In between, a wide range \nof systems explicitly address both objectives. Similarly there is a wide range in the degree of \nfunding (the extent to which benefits are financed from assets). Some countries have \nsignificant reliance on funding (Canada, Chile, Sweden, the United States), while others \norganise pensions mainly on a PAYG basis (France, Germany, Italy). Funding can be in \nindividual accounts (as in Chile and Sweden\u2019s premium pension) or in a trust fund (as in \nCanada, Sweden\u2019s inkomstpension and the United States). The Netherlands has a \nnoncontributory PAYG universal pension based on years of residence, together with funded \noccupational pensions that are effectively mandatory. Sweden\u2019s guarantee pension is based \non residence and goes only to those with little or no mandatory pension income. In 2008, \nChile introduced a noncontributory basic pension based on residence that is affluence-\ntested11, that is, it goes to all but the well-off.  \nAvoid excessive implicit taxes. Pension rules have a major impact on decisions about \nwhen to retire. In particular, badly-designed rules can encourage people to retire earlier than \nis efficient; in the limit, such incentives can have an effect similar to a mandatory retirement \nage. Gruber and Wise (1999, 2004) calculated for each year the implicit tax on earnings by \n                                                 \n10  See Barr and Diamond 2008, Ch. 11 and the references therein. Our judgment that a given country\u2019s system \nworks reasonably well should not be read as an endorsement of all the details of that system. Indeed, we have \nnever studied the system of a country without finding some elements we would change. \n11 I.e. a measure of eligibility for benefits that is designed to screen out only the best off, in contrast with an \nincome test, which screens out all except the poor. Some countries use means tests \u2013 which look at assets as well \nas income. \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 13   ISSR December 2008 \nworkers eligible to retire and find that a high implicit tax rate creates a significant incentive to \nearly retirement.  \nEarlier retirement does little or nothing to reduce unemployment. It is widely \nbelieved that earlier retirement will free jobs for younger workers. That view would be \ncorrect if the number of jobs in an economy were fixed. But the number of jobs is not fixed. \nFirst, as additional workers enter the labour force, they exert downward pressure on wages \nand make it easier for employers to find suitable workers, thus encouraging job creation; the \nnumber of jobs is variable and influenced by the number of workers. Second, taking a \npension early does not necessarily remove workers from the labour force, since some workers \ncontinue to work elsewhere while receiving a pension from a previous employer. Third, in a \ndeveloping economy (China, for example) urban unemployment is heavily influenced by \nmigration from rural areas, which may overwhelm any attempt to reduce urban \nunemployment through early retirement. \n Evidence shows that early retirement does not reduce unemployment: over many \ndecades, developed countries have seen a large decrease in the average retirement age, with \nno parallel decline in unemployment rates; and the Gruber-Wise tax variable which has a \nsignificant impact on employment has no impact on unemployment (Diamond 2006).  \nThus it is mistaken to change the pension system to encourage early retirement or to \nlower a mandated retirement age\u2014both longer-term solutions\u2014as palliative responses to \ncyclical unemployment, which is a short-term issue.12 Better to focus on unemployment \nbenefits and on incentives for long-run economic growth than to distort the labour market in \nthe vain hope that retirement will have a large impact on unemployment. Similarly, disability \nbenefits should be awarded on the basis of actual disability, not as a response to \nunemployment. \n \n2.2 Finance and funding \nUnsustainable pension promises need to be addressed directly. A frequently heard, \nbut flawed argument runs, \u201cPAYG pensions face major fiscal problems; therefore they should \nbe privatized.\u201d This is a non sequitur\u2014the \u201ctherefore\u201d does not follow. Whatever financing \nproblems a pension system may face, privatization does little or nothing to alleviate them; \nindeed, it may exacerbate them (as it did, for example, in Argentina, and would have with \n                                                 \n12 Structural unemployment may raise different issues. Additionally, labour markets may take time to adjust to \nan increased supply of older workers. \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 14   ISSR December 2008 \nsome U.S. proposals). It is important to distinguish between two questions:  is the fiscal cost \nof public pensions a problem;  and would a move toward funding be beneficial?  These are \nseparate questions, requiring separate answers. If a public pension is running a deficit that is \nregarded as unsustainable, the only solution is to make it sustainable by increasing \ncontributions, reducing benefits, or both. In contrast, if there are potential gains from funding, \na move in that direction may be sound policy even where the fiscal costs of a public pension \nare sustainable.  \nA move from PAYG towards mandatory funding may or may not be welfare \nimproving. Whether a move towards funding raises welfare depends on how the change in \npension system is designed and on country specifics. However, all countries should bear in \nmind the following conclusions.  \n1) Explicit public debt is not equivalent to implicit pension debt, since the politics of \nchanging the real values of the two debts are different, and bond markets understandably treat \nthem differently.  \n2) Funding can be organized in a variety of ways, both with and without funded \nindividual accounts.  It is possible to have funding without individual accounts, for example \nthrough a central trust fund, as in Sweden or Canada, or, conversely to have individual \naccounts without funding, through a system of notional accounts.  \n3) A move to funding generally has major fiscal costs. In a PAYG system the \ncontributions of younger workers pay the pensions of older people. But if a country moves to \na funded system, the contributions of younger workers will instead go into their individual \naccounts and so the pensions of retired people must come from some other source: higher \ntaxation, or a reduction in an existing budget surplus, or additional government borrowing, or \nreductions in spending on other government programs. Thus a move toward funding \ngenerally imposes an added burden on today\u2019s workers, who have to pay not only their own \ncontributions but also some or all of the taxes that finance current pensions. \nOne way to spread (but not eliminate) the fiscal costs of the transition is to phase \nfunded pensions in gradually. A country that wants to introduce individual accounts but \ncannot absorb the fiscal costs of transition, or where institutions are not yet strong enough to \nsupport mandatory funded accounts, has the option of introducing mandatory notional \ndefined-contribution pensions, supplemented by voluntary funded accounts. This approach \nmaintains the structure of individual accounts but avoids the additional fiscal and \nadministrative burdens of funding; it also keeps open the option of phasing in funding at a \nlater stage. The strategy is applicable to China (and was the recommendation of Asher et al. \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 15   ISSR December 2008 \n2005), and potentially to other countries where mandatory funding might be premature or \nmight have been adopted prematurely. \n Given these fiscal costs, analysis needs to take account of the costs of moving from \none steady state to another; it is mistaken simply to compare steady states before and after. \nThe analysis also needs to consider differences in risk and differences in administrative costs.  \n4) There is no automatic relationship between funding and growth. Funding will raise \nthe rate of economic growth if it increases saving or improves the efficiency with which \nsaving is channelled into investment. This may or may not be the case:  \n\u2022 Financing increased funds by issuing debt may not increase saving; increased \nmandatory pension saving may be largely offset by declines in other saving; and \nfunding may not be good policy if the saving rate is already high (for example, \nChina). \n\u2022 Formal capital markets may or may not allocate funds to investment more effectively \nthan informal capital markets. Gains in the effectiveness of capital markets are \npossible but depend on effective administration and on political support for improved \nregulation of financial markets. \nThus funding may increase national saving, or it may increase explicit public debt, or \nsome of each;  and it may improve the operation of capital markets. Either is possible; neither \nis inevitable. The economic case for funding has to be analyzed in each country. \nA related point is that funding is not an automatic solution to demographic problems; \nrather, its helpfulness is contingent on whether it has beneficial effects on growth (see also \nBarr, 2002, Myths 1-3). Without additional resources, longer lives require either later \nretirement or reduced monthly benefits, however they are financed. \n 5) A move to funding has intergenerational effects. If funding is to raise output \ngrowth in the future, it has to increase saving today. But for saving to increase, there must be \na decline in consumption \u2013 by government, or today\u2019s workers, or today\u2019s retirees, or a mix. \nThus a move to funding generally imposes a burden on today\u2019s generations to the benefit of \nfuture generations. Depending on country specifics, this may or may not be sound policy. \nMore generally, introducing a new PAYG system allows the early cohorts to receive larger \npensions than if the new system were fully funded. As noted earlier, therefore, any choice \namong PAYG, partial funding, and full funding is also and necessarily a choice about the \nintergenerational distribution of income and of risks. Hence, even if funding does increase \noutput, the change cannot be presented as a Pareto improvement. \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 16   ISSR December 2008 \n2.3 Implementation \nDo not ignore fiscal capacity. Spending on pensions must be compatible with a \ncountry\u2019s ability to finance the consumption of retirees, the investment from which future \neconomic growth derives, and the government\u2019s ability to raise revenues. Policy that ignores \nthe fiscal costs of a move towards funding will run into problems. China, for example, is \nfacing the problem of  \u201cempty accounts\u201d, as local governments often used the contributions \nof workers to their individual accounts to finance deficits in the PAYG pension, replenishing \nthe account with IOUs, which are, in effect, government bonds.  \nGovernment is an essential participant in any pension system. All pension systems \ndepend critically on public sector technical capacity. With PAYG systems this includes the \nability to collect taxes and contributions, to keep track for many years of the contributions of \nworkers who are mobile and who may change names, and to project future contributions and \nbenefits with reasonable accuracy.  \nIt is a fundamental error to suppose that private pensions get government out of the \npensions business. Given the major market imperfections discussed in Boxes 2 and 3, purely \nprivate arrangements for insurance and consumption smoothing will be either inefficient or \nnonexistent. Thus government has a major role in pensions, whatever the specific \narrangements. Government must be able to enforce compliance with contribution conditions, \nto maintain macroeconomic stability (and systemic stability more broadly), and to ensure \neffective regulation and supervision of pension plans and financial markets, including the \nannuities market. Such regulation is vital to protect individuals in areas too complex for them \nto protect themselves. More generally, private markets function best when government has \nput in place good, clear rules and where enforcement is even-handed, honest, prompt, and \npredictable.  \nPrivate sector capacity is essential for private pensions. Alongside government \ncapacity, private pensions also require considerable private sector capacity. Administrative \ntasks include the ability to collect contributions, to keep individual records over long periods, \nto inform workers about their accumulations and expected benefits, and to determine and pay \nbenefits. Financial tasks include the ability to manage large investment portfolios. \nThe capacity of consumers is important. Participants in pension arrangements need to \nbe educated about what they can expect at retirement and about how to think about the choices \nthey can make. This task, difficult enough in developed countries, is even harder in an economy \nwhere most workers have no experience in making such financial decisions. More generally, \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 17   ISSR December 2008 \nconsumer choice faces both information problems (Box 2) and problems over decision making \n(Box 3). \nImplementation matters. Policy design that exceeds a country\u2019s capacity to \nimplement it is bad policy design. Effective reform requires much more than good design; \nrather, it rests on a tripod of abilities: policy design, political implementation, and \nadministrative implementation. The importance of implementation is often underestimated. It \nrequires skills that are just as demanding as policy design, and those skills need to be \ninvolved when the policy is designed, not as an afterthought. Policy makers and advisers \nfrequently take an unduly optimistic view of the extent to which a country meets the \npreconditions for effective reform. \nIndividual funded accounts require financial institutions that are effective enough that \nthe added weight of pension business will further strengthen them. Yet \u201cthe Bank persistently \nencouraged countries such as Ukraine and Russia to institute multi-pillar reforms even when \nfinancial sector conditions were weak\u201d (World Bank 2006a, p. 56); it also encouraged such \nreforms in countries with poor corruption indexes (World Bank 2006a, Figure 3.5). \n Insufficient weight may be given to the administrative costs of individual accounts, \ncosts that are significant even in large, developed countries with long-established systems, \nand considerably higher for small accounts in small countries starting a new system. For \nexample, a charge of one percent of assets each year over a 40 year career reduces \naccumulations by nearly 20 percent at retirement. \n The administrative capacity of government is also important, yet, \n\u2018\u2026the limited quality of civil records in Bolivia allowed people to change their age \nand even to invent beneficiaries of the\u2026program. Second, the\u2026state did not have a \nbureaucracy in place that was capable of actually distributing the Bonosol [pension \nbenefit] to the elderly, many of whom had to travel from the countryside on foot to \ncollect the benefit in person\u2019 (Vald\u00e9s-Prieto 2007, para. 3.61). \n Problems arise also in developed economies. Pensions were missold in the United \nKingdom. Problems arise with regulating private defined-benefit plans. When a firm or \nindustry with an inadequately funded defined-benefit pension gets into financial trouble, its \nworkers and retirees lose some or all of the pension they were expecting. Countries have \nresponded in a range of ways, including government-provided guarantees and the imposition \nof funding requirements.  The former create a risk of moral hazard. The latter can also create \nproblems, since this type of demand on a firm\u2019s revenue typically comes at precisely the time \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 18   ISSR December 2008 \nwhen the firm is experiencing low profitability: low profitability and declining asset values \nare highly correlated.  \nThus, policies designed to ensure the long-run stability of defined-benefit plans face \nan inherent tension: too little regulation leaves workers with inadequate protection, but too \nmuch imposes excessive costs on plan sponsors, often at inopportune times, leading to \nwithdrawal of the plans, at least for new members. Given this tension it is worth considering \nwhether employer-provided defined-contribution plans in place of employer-provided \ndefined-benefit plans for new hires, provided they are well-structured and well-regulated, \nmight improve the social outcome.13 And countries that do not have defined benefit plans are \nprobably wise not to encourage them through tax concessions. \nVoluntary pensions have an important role. The balance between mandatory and \nvoluntary pensions must strike a balance between, on the one hand, the inefficiencies that \narise from a uniform mandate that takes incomplete account of differences in preferences and \nindividual constraints, and on the other, the gaps that arise if the mandatory system is small. \nSecondly, voluntary pensions can provide consumption smoothing in countries which wish to \nhave some funding but do not have the fiscal or institutional capacity to warrant a mandate. \n2.4 Pension design and economic development \nThe discussion in this section is not about optimal design, but about what limits on policy \nchoices make sense for countries at different levels of development.  \nWe illustrate implementation in terms of three stylized types of country: a low-income \ndeveloping country, a middle-income developing country, and a developed country. Actual \ncountries may occupy intermediate positions and mixed positions for different parts of the \neconomy. The discussion here uses the conventional terms of first-tier pensions (aimed \nprimarily at poverty relief), second-tier pensions (mandatory, intended to strengthen \nconsumption smoothing), and third-tier pensions (voluntary at the level of the firm or the \nindividual, subject to regulation and perhaps tax favoured, to accommodate differences in \nindividual preferences).  \nThe examples below are intended only as illustrations; they should not be taken as a \ntemplate. A country\u2019s administrative capacity may have some parts that are typical of middle-\nincome countries and others at a level more commonly found in low-income countries. Fiscal \nconstraints may call for different systems for different sectors or forms of employment: for \n                                                 \n13 Changing arrangements for existing workers can disrupt expectations in ways that may be unsatisfactory. \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 19   ISSR December 2008 \nexample, a middle-income country may have a formal system for urban areas and a simpler \none (or none) for rural areas. Similarly, a system designed for civil servants may differ from \none designed for an entire country. Once there is a national system, civil servants should be \npart of it, typically with a supplemental pension; large private firms may have a similar \narrangement.  \nAll the examples are based on the following assumptions: \n\u2022 that the parameters of the system (such as benefit levels and the age at which a \npension is first awarded) are consistent with fiscal sustainability, and \n\u2022 that, alongside pensions, all countries with the necessary administrative capacity \nprovide some degree of means-tested support for the elderly.  \nWe cite countries that have particular institutions of the type we describe while such \ncountries are not necessarily in the income-category being described.   \nIllustrative pension systems for a low-income country \nFirst tier. The choice is highly constrained: \n\u2022 A very poor country may be unable to finance or organize a national system of \npoverty relief, relying instead on family, charitable organizations, and local \ngovernment. \n\u2022 As capacity allows, it becomes possible to use general revenue for limited poverty \nrelief, through transfers to local governments or through a national system that targets \nby age. \nA country at a low level of development\u2014typically with a large informal sector and \nsubstantial household production\u2014will generally not have the capacity to administer an \nincome test. A system of local discretion may be able to do so in an approximate way. \nSecond tier. A country at this level of development will generally not have the \ncapacity to manage a mandatory earnings-related system, which requires, among other things, \nenforcing contributions and measuring and recording a person\u2019s income over forty years or \nmore. Such countries should leave such a system as an agendum for the future. \nThird tier. Any voluntary saving plans operating in the country should not be tax \nfavoured, since fiscal resources are highly constrained, and tax advantages are typically \nregressive. Nevertheless, provision of a simple, reliable opportunity for voluntary savings is \nimportant. \nIllustrative pension systems for a middle-income country \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 20   ISSR December 2008 \nFirst tier. Countries in this category have a choice of \n\u2022 a noncontributory, tax-financed pension (as in Australia, the Netherlands, New \nZealand, South Africa and, from 2008, Chile); or \n\u2022 a simple contributory PAYG pension, for example a flat-rate pension based on years \nof contributions (such as the basic state pension in the United Kingdom or Old Age \nSecurity in Canada). \nSecond tier. The choice is between \n\u2022 a publicly organized, earnings-related, defined-benefit pension, or possibly an NDC \npension; or \n\u2022 a defined-contribution pension as part of a provident fund (as in Malaysia and \nSingapore) or with sharply limited individual choice. \nIf there is a contributory first-tier pension, these can be separate from it or integrated. \nPolicymakers should consider the extent to which tax favouring is regressive. \nThird tier. Voluntary, defined-contribution pensions at the level of the firm or the \nindividual are possible; regulation is important, and any tax favouring should be designed to \navoid excessive regressivity. Tax-favouring should not extend to new defined benefit plans. \nOptions for pension systems in a developed country \nFirst tier. Countries should consider either \n\u2022 a noncontributory, tax-financed pension, as above; or \n\u2022 a contributory pension aimed at poverty relief (used in many countries, including the \nUnited Kingdom and United States), with any of an array of different designs.  \nSecond tier. The menu includes (separately or in combination) \n\u2022 a publicly organized, defined-benefit pension, as above; \n\u2022 an NDC system (as in Sweden); \n\u2022 an administratively cheap savings plan with access to annuities (like the Thrift \nSavings Plan for federal government employees in the United States); \n\u2022 mandatory, funded, defined-benefit pensions sponsored by industry (the de facto \nsystem in the Netherlands); or \n\u2022 funded, defined-contribution pensions (as in Chile and Sweden), possibly including an \nantipoverty element (as in Mexico). \nThird tier. Voluntary, defined-contribution pensions can be organized at the level of \nthe firm, the industry or the individual; regulation (particularly of the funding of defined \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 21   ISSR December 2008 \nbenefit plans) is important (and difficult), and any tax favouring should seek to avoid \nexcessive regressivity.  \nClearly choices widen as fiscal and administrative capacities grow. A country: \n\u2022 should not set up a system beyond its financial and administrative capability; \n\u2022 should not introduce a mandatory, earnings-related pension system until it has a \nrobust capacity to keep records accurately over forty or more years; and \n\u2022 should not introduce individual funded accounts (whether mandatory or as an option \nin a mandatory system) until it can regulate investment, accumulation, and \nannuitisation.  \nIt is clear that a developed country has a full range of choices. Thus it is not surprising \nthat the richer countries have very different systems one from another. But the fact that the \nrange of options is not greatly constrained by issues of feasibility should not be \nmisinterpreted: that a country is capable of implementing an administratively demanding plan \ndoes not mean that such a plan is a good idea or that it is necessarily superior to a less \nadministratively demanding system. New Zealand has a simple pension system through \nchoice, not constraint. \n3 Messages for policy makers \nCore arguments \n\u2022 The roots of the problems of pension finance are long-run trends, not a short-run \n\u2018crisis\u2019. \n\u2022 Pension systems have multiple purposes, diverse institutions, diverse histories, diverse \npolitics and diverse constraints.  \n\u2022 Thus there is no single best system. Pension systems differ widely. This is as it should \nbe. \n\u2022 Options widen as capacity constraints relax. But, as discussed in Box 3, even in the \nmost advanced economies there are benefits from keeping choices simple. \n\u2022 Advice about pension reform needs understanding of the underlying principles. There \nis room for disagreement about choice between sensible strategies;  there is wide \nagreement on some aspects of what makes bad policies. \n\u2022 Examples of bad policies include staying too long with an unsustainable system;  \nprematurely adopting a system that exceeds implementation capacity (Barr and \nDiamond 2008, chs 14 and 15 argue that the introduction of mandatory funded \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 22   ISSR December 2008 \nindividual accounts in China in 1998 is an example); and incorporating excessive \nimplicit taxes \u2013 many countries have systems where benefits rise insufficiently in \nresponse to later retirement. \nThe main solutions to problems of paying for pensions. In responding to long-run \ntrends, any improvement to the finances of a pension system must involve one or more of  \n\u2022 higher contribution rates,  \n\u2022 lower benefits, \n\u2022 later retirement at the same benefit, \n\u2022 policies, such as increased saving, designed to increase national output. \nThat statement remains true whatever the degree of funding. \nNicholas Barr and Peter Diamond 23   ISSR December 2008 \nReferences \n \nAsher, Mukul, Nicholas Barr, Peter Diamond, Edwin Lim, and James Mirrlees. 2005.
