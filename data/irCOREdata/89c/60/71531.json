Transitions ahead:  \npolitics, practice and sustainable transition management \n \nElizabeth Shove* and Gordon Walker** \nDepartment of Sociology* and Department of Geography**, Lancaster \nUniversity, Lancaster, LA1 4YD \nE.Shove@lancaster.ac.uk \n \n\u201cThe critique of the inanities and injustices of present society, however \nobvious they may be, is disqualified by a simple reminder that remaking \nsociety by design may only make it worse than it was. Alternative ends are \ninvalidated on the strength of the proved ineffectuality of means\u201d (Bauman \n1991; 269)  \n \nGreen (2006) is not alone in contending that \u201cenvironmental \u2018crises\u2019 require \nfundamental changes in the socio-technological structure of the way we live \nand work\u201d. For those concerned with sustainability, the idea of transition \u2013 of \nsubstantial change and movement from one state to another - has powerful \nnormative attractions. If \u2018we\u2019 can steer change, shape future development and \nmanage movement in desired directions, perhaps \u2018we\u2019 can make the \nenvironment a better and more sustainable place in which to live.  But how so \nto do? In a manifestly complex world dominated by hegemonic ideologies of \nneoliberal capitalism, global finance and commodity flows is it really possible \nto intervene and deliberately shift technologies, practices and social \narrangements \u2013 not to mention their systemic interaction and \ninterdependencies - on to an altogether different, altogether more sustainable \ntrack? \n \nAcross the board there is growing recognition of the holistic, unavoidably \ninterrelated nature of contemporary environmental problems and of the need \nfor fresh approaches and forms of governance capable of engaging with \ncomplex challenges of this kind. Theories and models of sustainable transition \nmanagement (STM), derived from a blend of academic traditions in \ninnovation, history and technology, appear to fit this bill and it is no wonder \nthat they are now catching on across a number of policy domains.  \n \nIn the Netherlands, government sponsored programmes have explicitly \nadopted methods of \u2018transition management\u2019 (Kemp and Loorbach 2006) and \nin the UK, the policy relevance of similar theories and methods is  being \nexplored and actively promoted through projects and events like those \nsupported by the ESRC\u2019s Sustainable Technologies Programme.   \nAcademically, and in just a few years, there has been rapid growth in the \n\u2018transition management\u2019 literature and in the appeal of approaches \ncharacterised by an alluring combination of agency, complexity, uncertainty \nand optimism.  \n \n We do not intend to provide a thorough review or critique of what is in any \ncase a burgeoning and quickly evolving literature, but at a time when the \nnotion of transition management is capturing so much attention it is as well to \nreflect on the distinctive features of this particular policy innovation.  With this \n 1\nlimited aim in mind, we offer some cautionary comments and identify a \nhandful of questions that deserve more explicit attention.  \n \nThe notion of transition is firmly rooted in traditions of system thinking which \nhighlight the co-evolution of the social and the technical and which seek to \nunderstand and analyse the emergence, transformation and decay of socio-\ntechnical systems. Much of the \u2018systems in transition\u2019 literature makes use of \nRip and Kemp\u2019s (1998) \u2018multi-level\u2019 model of innovation which distinguishes \nbetween the macro level of the sociotechnical landscape, the meso level \nregime and the micro level niche. The key idea is that change takes place \nthrough processes of co-evolution and mutual adaptation within and between \nthese layers. The multi-level model can therefore be used to describe how \nnew technologies emerge within more or less protected niches, and how they \nbecome \u2018working\u2019 configurations that shape and re-shape the regimes and \nlandscapes they sustain and that are in turn sustained by them.  In terms of \ntransition, the core task is to figure out how currently dominant sociotechnical \nregimes might be dislodged and replaced and how new configurations might \nbecome mainstream. \n \nFollowing this line of enquiry, the systems in transition literature has sought to \nconceptualise system dynamics, often through retrospective analyses of the \nrise and fall of selected sociotechnical systems and regimes (e.g. from sail to \nsteam ships, from horse to car, or from coal to gas (Geels 2002; Correlje and \nVerbong 2004). In literature of this kind, there is no assumption that better \nunderstanding will necessarily enhance the capacity to manage.  This is to be \nexpected in that the challenge is to understand the co-evolution of complex \nsystems in which the role of self-styled systems builders is necessarily \nconstrained and in which the outcome of deliberate intervention is inherently \nunpredictable. One consequence is that studies of systems in transition are \ntypically distanced, even voyeuristic, making few claims about how individuals \nand organisations can, might or should act to affect the processes in question \nor to steer trajectories towards pre-defined, normative goals.  \n \nIn contrast, proponents of transition management (Rotmans et. al. 2001;  \nSmith et. al. 2005; Kemp and Loorbach 2006), subscribe to models of agency \nand intervention not always shared by the commentators and systems \nliterature on which they draw.  There are relevant differences of opinion, for \ninstance, about whether transition management is a matter of picking one \ntrajectory or another \u2013 Kemp, for example, refers to routes that diverge in the \nforest1 \u2013 of agents shaping or making niches and paths (Berkhout et. al. 2004: \n50), or of managing critical processes of selection and variation within a \nbroader dynamic of sociotechnical evolution.  Whatever the conclusion on this \npoint, most recommend the deployment of multiple methods and tools for \nintervention, also arguing for processes of governance (rather than \ngovernment), for the involvement of diverse actors and knowledges, and for \nexplicit recognition of the uncertainties and limitations of science-based \nexpertise.  These strategies allow that managing systems involves \u2018extremely \ncomplex processes\u2019 (Elsen and Wieczorek 2005: 655) that are multi-actor, \n                                                 \n1 http:\/\/kemp.unu-merit.nl\/docs\/Transition%20management%20for%20SD3.doc (29.9.06) \n 2\nmulti-factor and multi-level.   However novel and complex the challenge might \nbe, the main point is that very idea of transition management supposes that \ndeliberate intervention in pursuit of specific goals, like those of sustainability, \nis possible and potentially effective. \n \nDifferences between analyses of systems in transition and models of \ntransition management are not only about representations of power or \ninterpretations of just how many \u2018invisible\u2019 hands are involved (Rip and Groen \n2001), they also have to do with the role and status of critical junctures, and \nthe possibility of anticipating turning points and moments when strategic \nnudging has the potential to change the trajectory of even complex and \nembedded systems.  It is around these themes that our cautionary comments \nrevolve.  \n \nCaution 1.  Transition politics \n \nLet us imagine, at least for the next few pages, that transitions can be \nmanaged and that this is something that transition managers do.  Who are \nthese critical actors and, just as important, on what authority and on whose \nbehalf do they act?   \n \nThe very idea of deliberate transition management supposes some kind of \norienting vision. In the field of environmental policy there is a tendency to \nassume that such an image exists and that it is defined and shared by a \nconstituency of institutional actors who are, by implication and example, \nlocated within national or regional organisations.  There is increasing interest \nin how societal aspirations and shared problem definitions are articulated \n(Kemp and Loorbach, 2006: 112) and in how transition managers might create \nand maintain public support over the long term (Kemp and Rotmans 2004: \n151) yet the general view is that goals like those of sustainability provide a \nsuitable target or provisionally desired destination.  The practical task is then \none of steering and levering events in that direction.  \n \nWhat are the everyday politics of such an enterprise?  When and how are the \ngoals of transition management subject to critical scrutiny, and by whom?  \nEqually important, who wins and who loses out as transitions are guided in \none direction but not another? We suggest that the normally obscure politics \nof transition management deserve more explicit attention on at least three \ncounts.  \n \nFirst, we argue there is a politics to the very processes of abstraction involved \nin defining something to manage (the \u2018it\u2019, or system) and to the implication that \nthere are managers of the \u2018it\u2019 who sit outside \u2018its\u2019 boundaries and who can \napply management tools including levers, niche-building machinery, and \nengineering devices from a privileged, knowledgeable and above all, external \nposition.   The process of abstracting the \u2018it\u2019 in question - the policy, the goal, \nthe system - from its historical and contemporary environment is not just a \ntechnical matter of analysis but a political, constructed and potentially \ncontested exercise in problem formulation.  By way of illustration, Geels \nsuggests that the transition from cesspools to sewer systems depended upon \n 3\na process of agenda setting in which specific concepts of hygiene and \nepidemiology acquired political power (Geels 2006).  \n \nFurthermore any truly systemic analysis cannot exclude actors who are cast \nas managers from the systems in which they seek to intervene and of which \nthey are a part.  Again this is not simply a matter of positioning: being part of a \nsystem necessarily limits actors\u2019 capacities to conceive and understand the \ndynamics of the whole. As Rip (2006) argues \u2018steering from within\u2019 is \nunavoidably myopic. Apparent successes are therefore as likely to reflect the  \nlocal repair work required to keep things going as the quality of anticipatory \nknowledge deployed by individuals and organisations that harbour illusions of \ntheir own management agency.        \n \nSecond, new kinds of research and analysis are required to articulate the \ncomplex, multiple and always contested commitments that go into making \nfuture visions toward which transitions are directed.  Social scientists are now \nused to critiquing science-based assessments of environmental impact, but \nwhat more is involved in evaluating the cultural and political assumptions and \ninstitutional side effects of transition management?  This is a distinctly \nchallenging task and one that should, at a minimum, involve careful scrutiny of \nthe historical evolution of guiding images and ideals, of their circulation across \ndifferent social and spatial scales, and of resistances to them.  Transition \nmanagers\u2019 efforts to develop and work towards shared societal or \nenvironmental goals are all very well but techniques like those of multi-\nstakeholder involvement in foresight exercises, or methods of public \nparticipation and deliberation are never \u2018neutral\u2019 and never evacuated of \npower and strategic behaviour (Bickerstaff and Walker 2006). Initiatives of this \nkind can be experienced as processes of co-option, the effect of which is to \nneuter rather than embrace dissent. In addition, and in any event, it is \nimportant to remember that stakeholders\u2019 visions of the future are always and \ninevitably shaped by the systems and social environments they inhabit today.  \n \nThird, despite extensive debate and rhetoric about the construction and \ndemocratic choice of visions and images of the future, the depth of the politics \ninvolved is frequently underplayed.  Certain socio-technical systems may be \nviewed as unproblematically desirable elements in an equally consensual, \nequally unproblematic interpretation of sustainability,  but others \u2013 such as the \n\u2018sustainable\u2019 nuclear based energy infrastructure currently advocated in the \nUK \u2013 are clearly not.  Advocates of sustainable transition management do not \nalways appreciate the deep ambivalence of sustainability as a category and \nits power as legitimising discourse.  For example, Kemp and Loorbach (2006: \n15), argue for strategies designed to promote \u2018transitions towards more \nenvironmentally and socially benign societal systems\u2019. It is perhaps possible \nto imagine some shared, technically determined specification of \nenvironmentally \u2018benign\u2019, but by what means might a more socially benign \nsocietal system be identified? For whom is the system more benign, by whose \nmeasure and across what space and scale? Even the most primitive attempt \nto establish starting assumptions (for example, does benign mean being more \nequal?) would immediately reveal divisions and fractures between opposing \ninterests and ideologies.  Fundamental conflicts of this kind rarely figure in the \n 4\nrather ordered and consensual world presented by much of the transition \nmanagement literature, this being a world in which \u2018interactive strategy \ndevelopment\u2019 appears both possible and plausible.  \n \nIn sum, it is necessary to recognise that provisional templates for transition \nare political statements that can only be partially inclusive (when there are \never more actors on the social stage), contingent (when conditions are \ndynamic) and potentially unstable as material forms and practices evolve over \ntime.  In other words, there is a politics to transition management, a playing \nout of power of when and how to decide and when and how to intervene, \nwhich cannot be hidden beneath the temporary illusion of \u2018post-political\u2019 \ncommon interest claims of sustainability (Swyngedouw 2006). \n \nStill assuming the possibility of transition management, these comments beg \nfurther questions about the work involved in re-defining and revising the goals \nof sustainable transition management as \u2018the system\u2019 evolves. \n \nCaution 2.  Managing transition management  \n \nCompared with \u2018normal\u2019 modernist policy makers, transition managers are \nexplicitly aware of the fact that they are handling complex problems and \nuncertain processes involving multiple, multi-level stakeholders.  They are \nalso aware that they are caught up in a cycle of problem-definition, \nintervention and response. Such complexities are to some degree \naccommodated in the framework of \u2018reflexive governance\u2019, this being a \ndiscourse and an approach that acknowledges and responds to the processes \nof globalisation and that recognises the increasing extent and range of actors \ninvolved in the organisation of daily life.  A system orientation, when combined \nwith ideas of reflexive governance, implies not one moment of intervention, \nfollowing which managers stand back and await the desired result, but a \nconstant, continual dynamic in which further adjustments are required as \nenvironmental conditions change, these changes being, in part, the outcome \nof previous interventions.  Feedback, monitoring and circuits of action and \nreaction are integral to this overall scheme.   \n \nAs Smith et. al. suggest, this calls for a new breed of managers schooled in \nthe arts of transition.  In their words, \u2018The art of governing transitions becomes \none of recognising which context for transformation prevails, and which \ndrivers offer the best leverage for guiding change in a desirable direction\u2019 \n(Smith et. al. 2005: 1498). \n \nBut what of the details?   What are the new institutions of reflexively governed \ntransition management, and what are the mechanisms through which goals \nare to be reinvented and revised in the light of events?  More pragmatically, \nwhat is to be monitored (and thus form the basis for reflection and review), \nhow frequently should this monitoring go on, and on what scale?  How are \ntransition managers to identify the early signs of trajectories that take decades \nto unfold (Geels and Kemp 2006), and how should they respond when \nrelevant dynamic processes speed up or slow down?   \n \n 5\nThese questions imply that reflexively governed sustainable transition \nmanagement (RGSTM) is an entirely new beast.  Not all commentators agree.  \nFor example, Kemp and Rotmans make the point that \u2018transition management \ndoes not call for an upheaval in policy instruments\u2019 (2004: 152), and Smith et \nal (2005) similarly write about a familiar repertoire of taxes, regulation and \nassorted incentives variously deployed in different transition situations.  \nThoroughly systemic, thoroughly co-evolutionary models of social and \nenvironmental change undoubtedly challenge conventional approaches to \nproblems of sustainability.  In so far as they embody these ideas, strategies of \ntransition management imply a necessarily radical overhauling of theory and \norientation, but our caution is that such techniques can also be incorporated \ninto political business-as-usual, albeit with a little more frequent revisiting of \ngoals and a somewhat longer term horizon.  \n \nSetting these issues of politics and agency aside, but still temporarily believing \nin the possibility of transition management, we now comment on two rather \ndifferent questions, both of which deserve further attention.   \n \nCaution 3: Missing Transitions  \n \nModels of transition management generally, but tacitly, suppose that the key \ntask is to support and stimulate transitions that are heading in the \u2018right\u2019 and \ntherefore more sustainable direction. Arguably equally important and largely \nneglected in the management literature are those transitions which appear to \nbe heading in exactly the opposite direction, which emerge from the left field, \n\u2018managed\u2019 by actors whose interests are not part of the consensus vision and \nwhose \u2018malignant\u2019 priorities lie elsewhere. The spread of air conditioning \nacross cultures and continents previously immune to the normalised \n\u2018requirement\u2019 for mechanical cooling is one such example (Chappells and \nShove 2005); the imminent arrival on European shores of the all singing and \ndancing, but distinctly resource intensive, \u2018Japanese paperless toilet\u2019 complete \nwith seat warmer, deoderiser, bottom washer and dryer is another.  How \nshould those concerned with sustainability respond to the increasingly rapid, \npowerful and expertly orchestrated diffusion of unsustainable technologies, \npractices and images? Is the subtle modulation of reflexive governance \ncapable of stemming and diverting unforeseen transitions of this kind, or are \nmore robust counter measures required?    \n \nA more comprehensively systemic approach would, of course, attend to the \nco-evolving dynamics of air-conditioning in relation to passive cooling and to \nchanging concepts of comfort, and would take note of the relation between \ncompeting systems and practices.  It would also offer an equally detailed \nanalysis of processes that parallel those of innovation, these being trajectories \nof erosion, decay and fossilisation.  Socio-paleontology \u2013 the study of \ndisappearing systems and practices \u2013 has yet to be developed on any scale \nand for the time being, theories of innovation dominate the field.   It is, \nhowever, clear that transitions of any description routinely involve and require \nthe loss or abandonment of previously important sociotechnical systems.  \nAlthough this is of interest to historians of technology, the transition \n 6\nmanagement literature says little about how the \u2018death\u2019 of undesirable \nsystems might be engineered. \n  \nCaution 4: Transitions in practice \n \nThis emphasis on innovation goes hand in hand with an also implicit focus on \ntechnical systems and infrastructures of provision and supply.  Popular \nexamples have to do with transportation systems (Elzen and Wieczorek \n2005), with water infrastructures (van der Brugge et. al. 2005), or with energy \nand \u2018the emergence of new technological, institutional or cultural patterns in \nutility provision\u2019 (Voss et al 2006: 175).  Sustainability is tacitly defined as a \nmatter of resource management, efficiency and ecological modernisation and, \nagain by implication, transitions in that direction require the transformation of \ncurrent systems of provision.  There are three points to notice about this \norientation.  First, and for all the talk of socio-technical co-evolution, there is \nalmost no reference to the ways of living or to the patterns of demand implied \nin what remain largely technological templates for the future.  Second, and \nbecause large-scale technological examples command so much attention, \ncommentators take it for granted that policy and corporate actors are the key \nplayers \u2013 even if the involvement of other groups and interests is vital (Smith, \n2006: 319). Third, the transition management literature consequently draws \nupon a narrow (perhaps necessarily narrow) slice of what is in fact a much \nwider debate about social systemic change.   \n \nThe literature on innovations in practice demonstrates that manufacturers and \nproducers are unable to control the fate and fortune of the things they make, \nand that consumers, far from being external to systems of innovation, are \ncentral to them (Franke and Shah, 2003; Shove and Pantzar 2005).  As we \nhave argued elsewhere (Shove 2003; Hand, Shove and Southerton 2005), the \nnormalisation of consumer expectations like those of showering every day, \nand of maintaining a standardised indoor environment, all over the world, \nwhatever the weather outside, sustain complexes of practice the successful \naccomplishment of which requires what are probably unsustainable patterns \nof demand.  However important these developments might be, and however \ncentral to sustainability, transition managers rarely attend to the dynamics or \nto the distinctive periodicities and mechanisms of change associated with \nthem. Nor do they have the conceptual resources with which to enter these \nordinary arenas of everyday life.  \n \nConcluding comments \n \nFaced with the possibility of transitions ahead and of a simplistic uptake of \napproaches and models originally rooted in the complexities of systems \nthinking, we suggest that caution is required.  \n \nWe are wary of the notion that transition management, with its accompanying \nrepertoire of concepts and tools, provides a neat model of how managers \nmight intervene (albeit reflexively) to shape and modulate processes of \nchange. We have observed that these approaches can all too easily obscure \ntheir own politics, smoothing over conflict and inequality; working with tacit \n 7\nassumptions of consensus and expecting far more than participatory \nprocesses can ever hope to deliver.  We also argue that there are important \ntypes and agents of change that are missed in much of this literature. These \ninclude rampant innovations that slice through expected and desired \npathways of change;  trajectories of fossilisation and decay (as established \nsociotechnical systems are abandoned), and fundamental transformations in \nthe ordinary routines of daily life.   \n \nFor academic readers, our commentary argues for loosening the intellectual \ngrip of \u2018innovation studies\u2019,  for backing off from the nested, hierarchical multi-\nlevel model as the only model in town, and for exploring other social scientific, \nbut also systemic theories of change. The more we think about the politics \nand practicalities of reflexive transition management, the more complex the \nprocess appears: for a policy audience, our words of caution could be read as \nan invitation to abandon the whole endeavour. If agency, predictability and \nlegitimacy are as limited as we\u2019ve suggested, this might be the only sensible \nconclusion.  \n \nHowever, we are with Rip (2006) in recognising the value, productivity and \neveryday necessity of an \u2018illusion of agency\u2019, and of the working expectation \nthat a difference can be made even in the face of so much evidence to the \ncontrary.  The outcomes of actions are unknowable, the system unsteerable \nand the effects of deliberate intervention inherently unpredictable and, \nironically, it is this that sustains concepts of agency and management. As Rip \nargues \u2018illusions are productive because they motivate action and repair work, \nand thus something (whatever) is achieved\u2019 (Rip 2006: 94). Situated inside the \nsystems they seek to influence, governance actors \u2013 and actors of other kinds \nas well - are part of the dynamics of change: even if they cannot steer from \nthe outside they are necessary to processes within.    \n \nThis is, of course, also true of academic life.  Here we are, busy critiquing and \nanalysing transition management in the expectation that somebody \nsomewhere is listening and maybe even taking notice.  If we removed that \nillusion would we bother writing anything at all? Maybe we need such fictions \nto keep us going, and maybe \u2013 fiction or no - somewhere along the line \nsomething really does happen, but not in ways that we can anticipate or know.    \n \n \nReferences \n \nBauman, Z.
