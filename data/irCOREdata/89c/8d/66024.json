Despite the unproblematic recording of modern graffiti, neither technique was able \nto document the spiral photographed and rubbed in 1995.

Despite avid \ninterest from the public, the site has received little attention from professional scholars, and it \nis only in the last ten years that a number of carvings, potentially of prehistoric origin, have \nbeen identified on the stones which make up the circle. One particular motif found in 1995, a \nspiral, is the focus of this article. The \u2018Spiral Stone\u2019 is located at the eastern side of circle, in \nposition 11 using the SMR notation. It is situated in the main circle, but also forms part of the \neastern end of a rectangular enclosure (fig. 1). The stone is approximately 1.5m high and 1m \nwide and is believed to be an erratic boulder originating from the Borrowdale volcanic series. \nIt has a number of parallel linear geological features running diagonally across the smooth, \nvertical inward facing surface, and it was on this panel here that the spiral was detected, \nabutting the most pronounced linear feature; it had a diameter of approximately 0.5m (based \non Beckensall\u2019s drawing) and a clock-wise direction.  \n \n \n \n 3\nFig.1 Sketch map showing the location of stone 11 at Castlerigg stone circle after \nWaterhouse [22, fig. 4.1] \n \nThe spiral motif was recorded on three different occasions soon after its initial identification. \nIt was firstly photographed in winter, in late afternoon, by Nick Best and Neil Stevenson, \nthen Newcastle University students [2, plate 18]. A copy of this photograph is now held by \nClive Waddington (pers. comm. 23.4.05). Months later, a few days before the Autumn \nEquinox, it was again photographed by Hanna Casement of Eskdalemuir [2, fig. 82]. She \nprovided a description of the discovery which was reproduced by Beckensall. Because of the \ndetails provided, we have considered it worth transcribing part of it once again: \nWe decided to wait for the sunset, and as it began we were facing away from the stone \nwatching the setting sun. It was purely by chance that I glanced behind me towards \nthe stone, and saw that it appeared to be glowing orange and had this huge spiral \ncoming out of the rock. It was absolutely unbelievable, as it had not been apparent all \nday. It seemed that it was only visible as the setting sun hit the rock. We were all \ncompletely amazed at the way this spiral seemed suddenly to appear, and tried to see \nif we could feel it carved into the rock. We couldn\u2019t feel anything very definite, but \nwe could definitely see it, and took photographs to prove it. I have returned to the \ncircle many times since to try to see the spiral again, but have never seen again what I \nsaw that day. Nor have I been sure that I could feel the outline of it. But the memory \nof that extraordinary experience and discovery will remain with me forever, as the \nspiral seemed to be glowing out of the rock as the sun hit it. \n[2, p. 70-1]. \n \nInformed about the discovery, the well-known rock art researcher, Stan Beckensall, promptly \nwent to the site to record it using his wax rubbing technique. In his book of Cumbrian rock \nart he explains that \u201cthe spiral was revealed after many attempts at rubbing the surface gently \nwith wax on thin, strong newsprint, although the motif remained unseen. I have made other \nrubbings since, with the same result\u201d [2, p.74]. \u201cOne of many rubbings made of the spiral\u201d, as \nthe caption explains, is portrayed in figure 85, alongside a photograph of the recording \nprocess in which another well-known rock art avocational archaeologist, Paul Brown together \nwith another person, hold the rubbing paper [2, fig. 85 and unnumbered in p. 75] (fig. 2). \nBeckensall also identified other motifs on stones 5 and 23, and lozenge shapes on stones 10 \nand 27 whose analysis will form part of a different study [12]. In his 1999 British Prehistoric \nRock Art, however, Beckensall explained that \u2018there has been a real problem with this spiral. I \nhave made a time-consuming wax rubbing of it, the spiral appeared, but I have not been able \nto see it on the rock itself!\u2019 [3, p.125]. \n \n 4\n \n \nFig. 2. Rubbing of the spiral published in Beckensall [2, fig. 85]. \n \nSince 1995, the spiral has never been seen again. As described in her letter, even one of the \ndiscoverers, Hanna Casement, was perplexed because of its invisibility after the first and only \nview of it. Everybody after her who knew about the spiral was also unable either to see or to \nfeel it. In early June 2004, during the fieldwork related to our project, a group of blind and \npartially-sighted tourists visiting the stone circle were invited to feel the surface for any \npatterns but none were able to detect any carving. It was noted, however, that at this time the \narea where the spiral had been photographed was covered in lichen growth of various species. \nThis contrasts with the colour photograph taken by Stevenson [2, plate 18] where the stone \nseems to be much cleaner.  \n \nCastlerigg circle has many visitors. We calculated that between 100 to 500 people visited \neach day that we were at the circle laser scanning the stones). As with many stone circles,  the \nsite is particularly popular during the period of the summer solstice and several accounts on \npopular web sites such as the megalithic portal (www.megalithic.co.uk) describe the awe \naroused by the experience.  The search for the spiral is also discussed on the Modern \nAntiquarian web site (www.themodernantiquarian.com). In April 2003 a contributor to this \nweb site named Chris Collyer confessed that he had been unable to find the \u201celusive spiral \ncarving\u201d. In August 2003 he again admits defeat: \u201cI was here this time to look at the carvings \non the stones particularly the elusive spiral \u2013 second attempt, second failure. I managed to \nfind the other 4 known marks, 2 of them are very faint and none are spectacular. There are \nseveral other stones that *may* have carvings that have yet to be recognised but the geology \nof the rock makes imagining cups, rings and grooves on their surface too tempting\u201d. In April \n 5\n2004 another contributor, \u2018Hob\u2019, discloses his own method to drive away visitors and \nmentions the spiral again: \nIf you ever find yourself despairing of getting this circle to yourself, but can't get there \nwhen there's no-one else about, try the following: Put a blanket over your head, get a \n1500kW rechargeable lamp, and hop about from stone to stone, whilst trying to angle \nthe lamp in just the right way to find the spiral carving, mutterring 'No.... Nope, nope, \nnot this one either...' to yourself as you go. (\u2026) If you want to actually find the \ncarving, check out Stan Beckensall's info, or that on the Rock Art in the British \nLandscape website. I wish I'd done that, then I'd have seen the spiral, but it wouldn't \nhave been as much fun... \n(in www.themodernantiquarian.com). \n \nIn late June 2004 a test using artificial illumination with oblique light was undertaken by our \nresearch team using powerful 1000 watt lamps. No spiral motif was apparent, however these \nconditions did reveal modern graffiti in approximately the same area, close to the natural \nparallel markings (fig. 3). \n \n 6\n \n \n 7\n \n \n 8\n \n \nFigure 3.a Stone 11 in daylight; b. Stone 11 with oblique lighting; c. Modern grafitti \nhighlighted by oblique lighting. Photogaphs by M. D\u00edaz-Andreu. \n \nPrior to the identification of the Castlerigg spiral, the distribution and significance of spiral \nmotifs in British rock art was explored by Van Hoek [21]. Following its identification, rock \nart scholars integrated the spiral motif at Castlerigg into on-going debates. Frodsham [15] \nreproduced it on page 112 and published later by Evans and Dowson [14]. Despite the fact \nthat the spiral motif is most frequently associated with the Irish (and Welsh) passage graves, \nthey are also found on both outcrops (as at Morwick in Northumberland, and Achnabreck in \nArgyll) as well as on cist slabs, other burial monuments, and also on different types of \nmaterial culture such as carved stone balls, mace heads and pottery. Locally, spiral designs \nare present on the standing stone of Long Meg1; on a stone in the cairn circle at Little Meg; \nand on a stone in the kerbed cairn at Glassonby. Examples of spirals on the uprights of stone \ncircles are rare: only two others are known, and one of these is questionable. Van Hoek [21, \np. 29] lists one at the Kiltierney stone circle, Fermanagh as bearing a spiral design although \nthis is not reflected by the catalogue compiled by Shee Twohig [19, p. 224]. The second, \n                                                 \n1 Beckensall [2, fig. 70] recorded spirals on three other stones at the Long Meg circle but only \none could be ascertained by the recording undertaken under our project, in the Long Meg \npillar itself [11]. Our project did not include the laser scanning of the stones of the circle itself \nand therefore we are not in the position to give an opinion about them. \n 9\nmuch clearer example is found at the Templewood southern stone circle in Kilmartin where a \ncomplex, triple \u2018horned\u2019 spiral design is located on the northernmost upright [18]. The spiral \nmotif at Castlerigg has been mentioned as one of several features suggesting prehistoric \nconnections between Cumbria, Ireland and Scotland [23]. Indeed, the spiral motif of stone 11 \nwas one of the main features that inspired our project \u201cBreaking through megalithic rock-art \nrecording\u201d (BTRAR), funded by the AHRB innovation awards, from which this article \nresults. The application of highly accurate recording techniques such as the innovative \ntechnique of laser scanning seemed ideal for stone 11, for the spiral at Castlerigg was no \nlonger visible to the naked eye and had not been photographed since 1995.  \n \n \nThe laser scanning recording of stone 11. \n \nThe main bulk of the laser scanning of all the stones of the Castlerigg stone circle was \nundertaken by a team from the Computer Science Department at Bristol University under the \ndirection of Dr Alan Chalmers in June 2004. The data set was acquired with a Minolta 910 \nlaser scanner and consisted of roughly 21.6 Gigabytes of data. For most of the stones they \nalso undertook the trimming of unwanted data and merging the individual scans into a 3D \nsurface by joining the individual elements together (as described in [1]). All the individual \nstanding stones were processed by Michael Rainsbury.  Some of the results obtained by the \nlaser scanning can be seen in the rock art web page of the Prehistoric Rock Art Interest Group \nof the Durham University (www.dur.ac.uk\/prehistoric.art\/). The data related to standing \nstones 1-10 and 12-48 will be the focus of a different article [12].  \n \nThe results obtained on stone 11 presented particular challenges. Because of the importance \nheld by stone 11, its scanning was undertaken at a high resolution. This resulted in more than \n205 separate scans and 3.9 Gigabytes of data. The sheer quantity of data led to previously \nunforeseen difficulties in acquisition and merging. The quantity of data meant that a full \nvisualisation of the scan of the whole stone was not possible and so data coverage of the \nnorthern edge of the stone is poor. Sets of individual scans were merged together and \ndecimated before in turn being merged with other decimated scans so building up the image \nof the stone. This manner of construction allowed the huge volume of data to be handled \nefficiently. Initial visualisation failed to find any carved spiral on the stone. However the data \nset had been heavily decimated to be able to view it in 3D. Individual scans over the location \nof the spiral were assembled and processed at lower degrees of decimation. These were then \npassed on to Nick Rosser for processing at little to no decimation through software available \nin the Department of Geography, Durham University. \n \n 10\nThe data was processed using firstly Demon3D (Archaeoptics Ltd) and then ENVI RT 4.0 \n(RSI) (for more details on the method see [11]). The result is seen in figure 4. Several \nfeatures can be observed. The natural bedding of the rock is evident as oblique striation. It is \nparticularly obvious in the upper left hand side third of the stone. An example of graffiti is \nclearly recorded in the upper part of the figure. It became clear that no spiral, or part of a \nspiral, is to be seen. In order to double check this, several cross sections were extracted from \nthe dataset using the Demon software. These are shown in figure 4g. Again, no positive \nresults are found. If lines had been carved in the surface, a see-saw profile should be seen. \n \n \n \nFigure 4a. Stone 11.

Cross-sections. \n \n \nGround-based remote sensing survey. \n \nThe lack of results from the laser scanning made the team wonder whether erosion was a \npossibility. Chris Brooke, an expert on ground-based remote sensing survey, was contacted. \nRemote Sensing is an established science that is well described in the literature [16]. Ground-\nbased remote sensing, adapted from aerial and orbital methods of survey, offers a \nnondestructive toolkit that employs precise methods of remote, electromagnetic examination \ncapable of revealing archaeological and natural features in buildings and objects that are not \nvisible to the unaided human eye [4, 5, 8]. Techniques, using laser surface profiling (not to be \nconfused with laser scanning, which is an entirely different process), and contrast enhancing \nillumination, have been developed that are capable of revealing very faint incisions and \nsurface decoration on eroded and damaged monuments [6, 7]. \n \nFive methods of ground-based imaging were employed in the examination of the Castlerigg \nstone: Multispectral imaging; CEI (Contrast\/Contour Enhancing Illumination);  MASS \n(Multiple Angle Surface Saturation); LASP (Laser Surface Profiling); and Ultraviolet \nfluorescence. The resulting imagery was digitally processed using the following broad \ncategories of analysis: Histogram stretching and ROI\/zonal equalization; Noise removal and \nsmoothing; Density slicing, pseudocolourization, and gradient profiling; Multispectral image \nregistration; Morphological operations (minimization convolutions and region growing); \nCluster analysis (k-means and segmentation); Edge detection (Sobel, Robinson, Prewitt, \nCanny, Laplace, and custom); Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) filtration (2D, frequency \ndomain) and signal amplification using ideal and custom filters. \n \nThe object of the examination was to determine if any evidence of incised or surface \ndecoration could be discerned: a) in non-visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum \n(near ultraviolet, monochromatic notches in the visible region, red-edge, and near infra-red), \nb) by visible fluorescence when excited by UV radiation, c) by imaging fractional surface \nvariations under extreme angular illumination (CEI) and saturation of the outer surface \n 12\n(MASS and LASP) using Xenon discharge and He-Ne laser sources with absence of \nbackground radiation (< 1lm m-2). Although the surface was, in part, obscured by lichen and \nbryophyte growth, and was in itself highly irregular in form, useful results were obtained \nfrom the remote sensing survey. \n \nVisual results showed that that no detectible fluorescence resulted under 50 W UV \nillumination, concluding that the surface vegetation did not exhibit any significant \nfluorescence using the selected excitation wavelengths (0.32 \u2013 0.4 \u00b5M), nor was there any \napparent signal from the rock surface. However, it must be noted that any surface decoration \n(as opposed to incised decoration) might be obscured by the lichen\/bryophyte covering. \n \nImages taken in the near infra-red (0.69 \u2013 0.9 \u00b5M) show typical variations in the thallus \ncovering and an anomaly in the form of a dark, elliptical feature, probably in the \nlichen\/bryophyte structure, that may be echoing a surface anomaly of roughly circular form \non the stone beneath (figure 5). The position of this anomaly does not match that of the \nearlier photographs showing the \u2018spiral\u2019; its origin and nature are unknown and may be due to \nnatural effects. Imagery produced in other bands \u2013 ultraviolet and monochromatic notches - \nreveal distinctive vegetation and geological traits, but no man-made structures are evident  \n(figure 6). \n \n \n \nFigure 5.

The LASP imagery shows possible delamination and the \nrough nature of the surface caused by the extensive lichen and bryophyte growth, but the only \nman-made incision revealed is an apparent area of graffiti with the possible name \u2018Kelly\u2019, \nundoubtedly of modern origin. \n \n \n \nFigure 7 \u2013 Figure 29: Contrast\/Contour Enhancing Illumination (CEI) image, revealing \nnatural erosion and geological features on the face of the stone. \n \n\u2018The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes\u2019. \n \nAll the different analyses undertaken during the \u201cBreaking Through Megalithic Art \nRecording\u201d project point to the same result: there is no carved spiral on stone 11 at \nCastlerigg. Neither the oblique artificial illumination, the laser scanning, nor the ground-\nbased remote sensing survey have been able to corroborate the existence of rock art on the \nstone. Yet, there are two photographs taken by two completely independent parties that seem \nto prove that in 1995 there was indeed a spiral present. Interestingly, in the description \nprovided by Hanna Casement, she explains that, even at the time when the photograph was \ntaken, neither her companions nor she could feel \u201canything very definite\u201d carved on the rock. \nIn our analysis of the problem, we concluded that this comment opened the possibility of the \nspiral having been painted, and not carved, on the stone. With this in mind we contacted Tom \nErrington, an artist colleague of one of the authors of this article, Chris Brooke. Errington \n 15\nwondered whether the definition of the spiral as seen in Stevenson\u2019s photograph was formed \nby the colour of the lichen. It seemed that the spiral had been painted onto the stone at some \npoint but when the photograph was taken it was no longer present. The lichen seemed to have \nrubbed off due to natural events. Errington suggested that one of the possible substances the \nspiral could have been made with was yoghurt (Errington, pers.comm. 3.10.2004). Its final \ndisappearance could be due to natural causes.  \n \nThe discovery and loss of the spiral motif in Castlerigg is a cautionary tale. Both professional \nand avocational archaeologists and other enthusiasts could perhaps be associated with the \nemperor in \u2018The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes\u2019 childrens\u2019 story: all of us have been too eager to \nbelieve what we could not see. Not all of the story is, however, relevant: we do not want to \nimply here that the spiral was made purposely as a fake. Most probably, whoever created the \nspiral on stone 11 never forsaw the consequences. Perhaps they remain unaware of them even \ntoday. For professionals there is perhaps another lesson to learn from the vanishing spiral on \nstone 11: the techniques traditionally used for recording rock art in Britain are clearly fallible. \nWith a few exceptions, the majority of recordings currently available have been produced by \nenthusiasts with basic tools, often under difficult conditions in the field. The most frequently \nemployed techniques have been free hand drawing, tracing, and the most popular in the last \ntwo decades, rubbing2. These all present some problems: they document in two-dimensions \nwhat are essentially three-dimensional surfaces and volumes, and both tracing and rubbing \nare invasive, potentially affecting rock art preservation. This is especially true of rubbing \nwhen carried out with acid paper such as that used for the production of newspapers [10, 17].  \n \nThe techniques traditionally used in Britain to record prehistoric carvings also involve a high \ndegree of subjectivity; so recordings undertaken on separate occasions may vary.  At \nCastlerigg only a set of rubbings, perhaps undertaken in the same day, had been produced \nbefore the start of our project. The one published clearly showed a spiral. Because nobody \nelse has been able to record stone 11, no comparison can be made. In our experience during \nour many attempts to see the spiral we found that intense scrutiny of the stone resulted in our \nbeginning to see a variety of circular patterns.  This was perhaps due due to the nature of the \nstone, composed, as Beckensall himself explains, of \u201ctiny pinpoints of minerals\u201d, combined \nwith the natural tendency of the human brain to seek patterns in these small variations of \ncolour and depth. This need of the human psyche to create sense from chaos introduces a \nhighly subjective element into the recording process and is yet another reason for the \nadoption, where possible, of the new, more controlled recording methods.  \n \n                                                 \n2 Other techniques such as casting and photography have been mainly used for illustration \nrather than for recording (although see [13]). \n 16\nProjects such as \u201cBreaking through rock art recording: three dimensional laser scanning of \nmegalithic rock art\u201d [11, 20] have been able to demonstrate that novel technologies based on \nthe digitisation of 3D surfaces with millimetre and submillimetre accuracy such as laser \nscanning and ground-based remote sensing \u2013 as well as others based on the use of \nphotogrammetry (see [9] \u2013 offer many advantages to the recording of prehistoric carvings. In \naddition to avoiding direct contact with the rock surface, eliminating the preservation \nconcerns raised by other techniques, both produce high quality images (laser scaning offering \na greater potential for this, but at higher cost) having a much higher level of objectivity, and \nprecision and accuracy far beyond those of traditional recording methods such as wax \nrubbings and scale drawings. It is time to move forward. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis article is the result of Grant B\/IA\/AN4440\/APN17641, applied on 30 September 2003 \ninnovation awards competition of the then AHRB, with the title \u201cBreaking through rock art \nrecording: three dimensional laser scanning of megalithic rock art\u201d.
