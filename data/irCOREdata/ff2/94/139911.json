A ceramic-faced armour design \nusually consists of the hard disrupting face of the ceramic and some kind of absorbing element \nbehind. The purpose of the ceramic is to induce fragmentation in the projectile or induce erosion \nthereby redirecting and dispersing the kinetic energy. The absorber on the other hand, acts to \ntransfer the kinetic energy of the projectile to a lower form of energy \u2013 such as heat, through \ninelastic deformation (for example). Ceramics, are inherently brittle materials and consequently \nhave fracture toughness (KIc) values in the 1-5 MPam\u00bd range as opposed to the 5\u2014170 MPam\u00bd \nrange for metals [11]. Consequently, when a projectile impacts and penetrates the ceramic face, \nbrittle failure ensues leading to extensive fragmentation of the tile. If the fragments are not \nretained in place then the multi-hit capability of the armour is compromised. \nMany modern-day armours are regularly subjected to automatic weapons fire where \nmultiple bullets are fired towards a single location. Accordingly for multi-hit protection, it is \nnecessary to retain as much ceramic material intact as possible after each subsequent hit. One of \nthe ways that this can be achieved is by reducing the tile-size such that that if one tile has been \ndestroyed protecting against a single projectile, the exposed area to subsequent strikes is \nminimized. Reducing the tile size inevitably leads to an increase in the number of interfaces \nbetween tiles for a given area. Bless and Jurick [12] have conducted a probability-based analysis \nof such mosaics to determine how multi-hit protection varies with tile size. They concluded that \nthe impact of interfaces is likely for most armour system designs of interest. De Rosset [13] has \nalso studied such patterned armours to examine the probability of defeating automatic weapons \nfire and similarly shown the vulnerability of joins between individual cells. However, for these \nMaterials and Design Vol. 29 (8), pp. 1497 \u2013 1503 \n 3\ntypes of analyses there is a requirement to know how the ballistic performance is affected by the \nproximity of the impact to the tile edge. Without this knowledge, only crude assumptions can be \nmade. \n There is little published work in the open literature on the effect of tile size on the \nballistic performance of ceramic-faced armours. Researchers have however, studied the effect of \napplying radial confinement to ceramic targets on their behaviour under dynamic loading \nconditions. The effect of the radial confinement on the behaviour of a ceramic tile has been \nstudied by Sherman [14] who impacted a confined ceramic tile by a 0.30\u201d armour piercing \nprojectile. He showed that the addition of a steel confinement frame reduces the damage to the \ntile significantly whereas using other supporting materials of lower acoustic impedance leads to \ngreater ceramic tile damage. Others have shown that the effect of adding steel radial confinement \nto ceramics subjected to high velocity long rod penetration also results in the resistance to \npenetration increasing [15,16]. \n  The size of the tile is also important for ballistic testing of the ceramic. Good reviews of \nthe various techniques are provided by James [17] and Normandia and Gooch [18]. There are \nclear advantages in using small tiles, not only in the cost of the ceramic but also the cost of the \nbacking materials. Therefore it is advantageous to the design engineer to know the smallest tile-\nsize that will provide the most accurate data on the material\u2019s ballistic resistance. \n In most cost-effective mosaic armour designs, the sides of the tiles are unlikely to be \nground flat and therefore there will be little or no intimate contact between each tile. Therefore to \nevaluate the worst case scenario it should be assumed that each tile is performing independently \nof its neighbour. In this work we have evaluated the effect of the proximity of a central impact \npoint to a free surface on the ceramic armour\u2019s ballistic performance. Both the type of ceramic \nMaterials and Design Vol. 29 (8), pp. 1497 \u2013 1503 \n 4\nand the size of the tile were varied. This work is part of a wider study on the resistance of \nceramic-faced armour to penetration by tungsten-carbide cored projectiles.  \n \nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP \n       \nThe depth-of-penetration technique as described by Rozenberg and Yeshurun [19] was \nused to measure the ballistic performance of the ceramic tiles (see Figure 1). In this work, \npolycarbonate was chosen as the backing material instead of more commonly used materials \nsuch as RHA or aluminium. The use of polycarbonate, which is less resistant to ballistic \npenetration, has the advantage that any small differences in the ballistic performance of the tile \nwill result in relatively large differences in depth-of-penetration. Polycarbonate is clear so that \nanalysis of depth-of-penetration can be done instantly without the requirement of X-Ray. It also \nhas a similar acoustic impedance to the fibre composite used in light armour systems which leads \nto a more realistic trial than using a semi-infinite steel or aluminium backing. In these trials \nmultiple polycarbonate tiles were used; each 100mm \u00d7 100mm \u00d712mm clamped together to form \na semi-infinite target. \n \nMaterials and ammunition used \n \nTwo silicon carbides of varying sizes were tested: a direct sintered silicon carbide \n(Morgan AM&T PS-5000) and a commercially available liquid-phase-sintered (LPS) silicon \ncarbide. These will be referred to as sSiC and LPS SiC in this paper. Their measured properties \nare presented in Table 1 along with the properties of polycarbonate taken from [20]. The elastic \nMaterials and Design Vol. 29 (8), pp. 1497 \u2013 1503 \n 5\nproperties of the silicon carbides were very similar. The densities were measured using a gas \npycnometer and the longitudinal wave velocities, Young\u2019s modulus values and Poisson\u2019s ratios \nwere measured ultrasonically using Panametrics\u2019 5MHz longitudinal and shear-wave probes with \nthe pulse-echo method. The true hardness values (HV0) were calculated from a series of micro-\nhardness tests at different loads using an Indentec HWDM7. All ceramics tested were 7.5mm \nthick. The tiles were cut to 33\u00d733mm, 51\u00d751mm, 66\u00d766mm and 85\u00d785mm. A minimum of four \ntiles for each ceramic type and size were tested. Each ceramic tile was glued using Araldite \nAV4076-1 and HY4076 hardener mixed in the proportion of ten to four in weight. The surface of \nthe polycarbonate was abraded in order to improve the gluing quality. A film of adhesive was \napplied on the ceramic surface which was then manually pressed against the polycarbonate and \ntwisted until a continuous adhesive layer free of air bubbles was obtained. All the targets were \nglued and let to set at room temperature for at least 72 hours in an environment protected from \nlight and moisture. \n \nFigure 1 NEAR HERE. \n \nTable 1 NEAR HERE. \n \nFigure 2 shows the 7.62mm AP \u201cSniper 9\u201d round core that was used for the ballistic tests. \nThis projectile consists of a WC-Co cermet core placed in an aluminium cup and encased in a \nCu-Zn jacket. The projectile\u2019s mass = 9.176g \u00b10.001g and measures 22.7mm in length and \n7.8mm in diameter. The WC-Co core\u2019s mass = 5.556g \u00b10.001g and measures 22.3mm in length \nand 5.2mm in diameter with a 55\u00b0 nose angle. The measured core hardness was 1292 \u00b1 24 \nMaterials and Design Vol. 29 (8), pp. 1497 \u2013 1503 \n 6\n[HV2]. Chemical analysis of the core material revealed that it was of composition (weight \npercent) Co 11.6, C 5.4, Cu 0.1, balance W with no other element greater than 0.05 weight \npercent. The average muzzle velocity of this bullet was 838.0 m\/s with a standard deviation of \n5.3 m\/s. The ammunition from our experimental set-up had an average dispersion of 4.3mm from \nthe aim-point with a standard deviation of 2.5mm. \n \nFigure 2 NEAR HERE. \n  \nAfter the tests, the polycarbonate was cut and the residual depth-of-penetration of the \nprojectile in the backing material was measured and recorded. The distance from the impact \npoint to the borders of the ceramic tile were also measured and recorded. \n \nNUMERICAL MODEL \n \nTo elucidate the mechanisms of penetration and the effect of the tile edges on the penetrating \nprojectile for the sSiC case we have conducted a series of computations. All computations were \ncarried out using 2D axial symmetry using a Lagrangian mesh in the explicit non-linear transient \ndynamic numerical code - AUTODYN-2D. This software is explained in detail elsewhere [21] \nand a useful overview of these types of codes is provided by Anderson [22]. However in brief, \nthis code solves the conservations laws of mass and momentum based on initial boundary \nconditions. The user is prompted for an equation of state that describes the pressure in terms of \nthe internal energy and volume and a constitutive relationship that calculates the flow stress in \nMaterials and Design Vol. 29 (8), pp. 1497 \u2013 1503 \n 7\nterms of a number of material and application-dependent parameters including strain, strain-rate \nand temperature. Failure models can be introduced to describe the failure. \n \nMaterial models \n \nTo model the failure of the ceramic we used the Johnson-Holmquist strength and failure model \u2013 \nJH-1 [23]. The application of this material model in AUTODYN\u2122 has been previously validated \n[24]. Data for this model has been acquired and successfully applied to simulate the dynamic \nresponse of glass [25], alumina [26,27], silicon carbide [23], and boron carbide [28,29]. A brief \ndescription of the model is given as follows: The schematic illustration of the JH-1 model from \n[23] is shown in Figure 2. The intact material strength is described as the linear segmented curve \nwhere the equivalent stress is a function of pressure. Any increase of strain rate under a given \npressure increases the equivalent stress and therefore makes the material stronger. This is done \naccording to \n \n)ln0.1(0 \u03b5\u03c3\u03c3 &C+=         (1) \n \nwhere \u03b5&  is the strain rate, \u03c3 is the equivalent flow strength,  \u03c30 is the available strength at \n0.1=\u03b5&  and C is the strain rate constant. When damage to the ceramic occurs, the equivalent \nstress for a given pressure reduces and consequently the material becomes weaker. Damage (D) \nis defined as the ratio of the total accumulated increment of plastic strain and the equivalent \nfailure strain. The material fails when either pressure reaches the tensile limit T or damage D is \nMaterials and Design Vol. 29 (8), pp. 1497 \u2013 1503 \n 8\nequal to 1.0. After material is failed, it cannot withstand any tensile loading but can still \nwithstand a limited compressive loading. \n \nFigure 3 NEAR HERE \n \nModelling brittle materials is particularly troublesome as there is no experimental data \navailable for the strength of the failed silicon carbide. Previous work [23] has centred around the \npenetration of SiC B \u2013 a pressure-assisted-densified silicon carbide manufactured by Cercom \nInc. for which there is a reasonable amount of data on its dynamic behaviour. However, there is a \npaucity of similar data available for sintered silicon carbides. Consequently, no attempt has been \nmade to derive a material model for our specific sintered silicon carbides. \nInitial simulations with a \u220585 mm tile revealed that the current formulation of the JH-1  \nbased on the SiC-B ceramic yielded a residual depth-of-penetration into the polycarbonate of 28 \nmm. This penetration depth was an over-prediction of the average experimental result of 15mm \nfor the sSiC case.  Consequently, we changed two parameters that have been used in [23] to \ndefine the strength of the damaged material (\u03b1 and Sfmax). These parameters were not directly \nmeasured from laboratory tests but rather derived through computation of the sSiC experimental \nresults. We have increased these values by simulating our experimental results from the \npenetration of the 7.5 mm thick 85 mm \u00d7 85 mm sSiC tile. This yielded values of  \u03b1 = 0.80 and \nSfmax = 3.2 GPa respectively to achieve a depth-of-penetration of 21 mm. The latter value (Sfmax ) \nis particularly high however, given that we are simulating the failure of a different silicon carbide \nto the one reported in [23] and that the equivalent strength of damaged material can be higher \nthan this value for other brittle materials [30,31] we feel justified in using this value in our \nMaterials and Design Vol. 29 (8), pp. 1497 \u2013 1503 \n 9\nsimulations. \nThere exists very little data on the dynamic behaviour of tungsten carbide too and, in \nparticular the dynamic fracture characteristics that would lead to an appropriate material model.  \nVarious attempts have been made in the past to model the failure of tungsten carbide \nmaterials that are subjected to shock loading. Both Aries et al [32] and Lopez Puente et al [33] \nhave adopted the approach of Cortes et al [34]. In these works a model originally intended to \nmodel the failure of ceramics has been used. This involves the use of a pressure dependent yield \nsurface and the evolution of damage that is associated with ceramic fragmentation through a \ncalculated scalar damage parameter. In both cases they were modelling the penetration into a \nceramic-faced composite armour using the LAPUA 7.62 mm armour piercing bullet. \nHolmquist et al  [35] adopted the approach of using both Johnson Cook fracture model \n[36] and a simple principal stress failure model for modelling the penetration of a tungsten \ncarbide \u2013cored projectile  through a range of target materials. They concluded that the Johnson \nCook fracture model represented the failure of the core. Their results showed good correlation of \na 14.5 mm BS41 surrogate projectile penetrating monolithic and layered targets \u2013 including a \nceramic- faced armour. Their material model for the tungsten carbide was based on a material \nwith a 5.7% Co content that possessed a uniaxial compressive strength of 5.9 GPa [37]. \nHowever, tungsten carbide can demonstrate a range of strength properties depending on the Co \ncontent and the grain size [38]. Generally speaking, increasing the Co content affects the \ncompressive strength. Consequently, we have not adopted Holmquist et al\u2019s model for our core \nmaterial as we have sought to choose from the literature data for a tungsten carbide that has a \nsimilar Co content. Early work by Johnson [39] presents data on a range of tungsten carbide \nmaterials with varying Co binder content and it was from this work that we drew our the material \nMaterials and Design Vol. 29 (8), pp. 1497 \u2013 1503 \n 10\nmodel for the core. Under uniaxial compression, a tungsten carbide with a 10% wt Co content \nbehaved according to: \n \nn\npBA \u03b5\u03c3 +=          (2) \n \nwhere  A  is the yield strength at zero plastic strain, B is the strain hardening parameter \nand n is the strain hardening exponent. From [39], the values were A = 1.55 GPa, B = 22 and n  = \n0.45. In this work we have assumed that the strain-rate hardening effects of the tungsten carbide \nare small in comparison to the strain hardening effects and consequently they have been ignored. \nThe tensile failure stress of the core material was also taken from [39] and was set to 1 GPa. \nThe gilding metal jacket was modelled assuming a flow stress of 575 MPa; this is \nconsistent with the hardness measurements of the jacket before firing. Due to the face-centred \ncubic structure of this material and because it was heavily cold-worked during the bullet\u2019s \nmanufacture, strain-rate effects were assumed to be zero. Further, we assumed an elastic-\nperfectly plastic behaviour. The strain-to-failure values for this type of cold-worked alloy are \ntypically less than 5 % [40] and therefore a principle strain failure criteria was used that was set \nto this value.  \nThe polycarbonate data was extracted from the AUTODYN\u2122 material library [41]. This \ndata was derived from [42]. The behaviour of the polycarbonate was modelled using a piecewise \nJohnson-Cook model and assumed to follow the stress-strain behaviour as defined by Table 2. \nThe strain-rate strengthening behaviour was calculated according to Equation 1 with C = 0.040. \nFailure occurred when the effective plastic strain reached 200%. \nMaterials and Design Vol. 29 (8), pp. 1497 \u2013 1503 \n 11\nThe equation of state for the gilding metal and polycarbonate was of Mie-Gr\u00fcneisen form \n[43] derived from a linear shock-particle Hugoniot thus: \n \nps SUcU += 0          (3) \n \nwhere Us and Up are the shock and particle velocities respectively, c0  is the bulk sound speed and \nS is the slope in the Us versus Up diagram. For the tungsten carbide core, no equation of state \ndata was available for our particular alloy and therefore we adopted the equation of state from \nHolmquist et al [35]. \nFor the silicon carbide, a polynomial equation of state was used when D<1.0 to define \nthe pressure according to [23] \n \n3\n3\n2\n21 \u03bc\u03bc\u03bc KKKP ++=         (4) \n \nwhere K1 is the bulk modulus and K2 and K3 are material constants and \u03bc is the material \ncompression given by \u03c1\/\u03c10 -1. When D=1.0, a bulking factor is added to Equation 4 to take into \naccount the increase in local pressure due to material failure [23]. \nMaterial data for the gilding metal and polycarbonate was available in the AUTODYN \nmaterial libraries and is presented in Table 3. Material model data for the silicon carbide is \nprovided in Table 4. \n \nTable 2 NEAR HERE. \n \nMaterials and Design Vol. 29 (8), pp. 1497 \u2013 1503 \n 12\nTable 3 NEAR HERE. \n \nTable 4 NEAR HERE. \n \nFinally, cells were eroded according to a predetermined geometric strain value for each of the \nmaterials. These values were 250% for the silicon carbide and nominally 200% for the gilding \nmetal, tungsten carbide and polycarbonate. A parametric investigation revealed that increasing \nthe values in the core and the polycarbonate had  little effect on the recorded depth-of-\npenetration into the polycarbonate or the penetration mechanism. \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nExperimental \n \nBelow in Figure 5 are the recorded depth-of-penetration data for each of the ceramic-\nfaced armour targets tested. Each reported data point refers to the average of the number of shots \nper tile and the error bars represent the spread in the data. Note that for the LPS SiC the depth-of-\npenetration is significantly higher than the sSiC and consequently represents a lower ballistic \nperformance. It has been previously noted by Ray et al [44] that the ballistic efficiency of liquid-\nphase-sintered SiC against WC-Co projectiles is significantly less than for SiC made through \nalternative routes such as hot processing. Consequently, a thicker sample is required to shatter \nthe projectile core. It has also been pointed out by Ray et al [44] that the measured depth of \npenetration using the DOP technique strongly correlates with the hardness of the ceramic. Given \nMaterials and Design Vol. 29 (8), pp. 1497 \u2013 1503 \n 13\nthat the LPS SiC has a lower hardness than the sSiC, our results are consistent with their results.  \nIt is also worth noting the spread of the data denoted by the error bars. For the sSiC targets the \nsmaller targets exhibit more scatter in the results. However for the LPS SiC targets the scatter \nwas fairly consistent from shot-to-shot. This pattern is also consistent with the core fragments \nthat were recovered after each firing. Where the scatter was relatively large the fragments of the \ncore could be recovered; where the scatter was small, the core had been mostly particulated (see \nFigure 4). \n \nFigure 4 NEAR HERE. \n \nFigure 5 NEAR HERE. \n \nThere appears to be little effect on the impact\u2019s proximity to the border for the LPS SiC \nmaterial. Re-plotting Figure 5 in terms of the proximity of the impact to the sSiC ceramic tile\u2019s \nedge shows the border-effect more prominently. Here the data is presented as individual \npenetration depths. \n \nFigure 6 NEAR HERE. \n \nFrom the depth-of-penetration results presented in Figure 6 it can be seen that the sSiC \nballistic performance was dependent of the distance from the impact point to the tile border. The \nperformance increases as the impact occurs further from the border. The depth-of-penetration \nMaterials and Design Vol. 29 (8), pp. 1497 \u2013 1503 \n 14\ninto the polycarbonate rear layers after impacting the ceramic tile at 12 mm from the border was \n43 mm. This was almost three-times the depth-of-penetration when the penetration was 42 mm \nfrom the closest border. For the sSiC beyond a critical distance, somewhere between 30 and 35 \nmm, the depth-of-penetration reached a consistent value (allowing for experimental scatter). At \nthis location, the material\u2019s intrinsic ballistic performance was measured due to the absence of \nborder effects. \nWith the sSiC tiles, fragments of the projectile could be recovered when the projectile \ncompletely penetrated a small tile of ceramic, but it was completely comminuted when the \nprojectile completely penetrated an 85 mm tile. This explains the drop-off in depth-of-\npenetration with this ceramic as seen in Figure 6. The same does not occur with the liquid-phase-\nsintered tiles because there was little difference in the projectile\u2019s morphology during penetration \nregardless of the proximity of impact to a border. In this case, the recovered projectile was \nfragmented (see Figure 7 below). \n \nFigure 7 NEAR HERE \n \nComputational Model \n \nThe numerical study also demonstrated that a smaller tile resulted in less resistance to \npenetration. Figure 8 below shows a series of computational results from the penetration into the \nceramic-faced polycarbonate target. There are a few observations to note from this \ncomputational model. Firstly, by 10 \u00b5s after impact the both the core and the jacket have failed \nresulting in the jacket flowing radially along the surface of the ceramic. By this time, stress \nMaterials and Design Vol. 29 (8), pp. 1497 \u2013 1503 \n 15\nwaves have been reflected from the ceramic \/ polycarbonate interface contributing to the \ndamage. A coniod of damaged material has been formed below the penetrating core. The 33mm \ntarget possessed a slightly different form than that of the 85 mm target showing a two-step area \nof damaged had occurred at c. 1.5 mm from the rear surface. This is indicative of a stress wave \nreflecting off the periphery of the tile contributing to further damage. However, by 20 \u00b5s the 33 \nmm target exhibits a large amount of damage and radial displacement of the damaged material \nwhereas the 85 mm target is largely retained intact. Between 10\u00b5s and 20\u00b5s the \u220533 mm target \naccrued damage at a faster rate than the \u220585mm target. The extent of the damage in the 33 mm \ntarget leads to a reduction in the erosion observed in the projectile and consequently more intact \nprojectile is able to penetrate. Ultimately, the depth-of-penetration into the polycarbonate \nbacking was 38 mm after completely penetrating the 7.5 mm thick \u220533 mm tile. The depth-of-\npenetration after completely penetrating a 7.5 mm thick \u220585 mm tile was 21 mm. Given that the \nsimulations were calibrated by changing the strength characteristics of the damaged silicon \ncarbide for a \u220585 mm tile, the depth of penetration for the \u220533 mm case is in good agreement \nwith the sSiC experimental results shown in Figure 6 above. \n \nFigure 8 NEAR HERE. \n \nThe \u220585 mm target appears to show considerable dwell in the initial 10-20 \u00b5s. This is consistent \nwith results from other researchers that have studied the penetration into similar thicknesses of \nsilicon carbide by small arms projectiles [23]. Whereas the degree of dwell induced by the 33 \nmm tile is significantly less by virtue of the earlier onset of damage. Our simulations of the \npenetration into a 7.5 mm thick \u220533 mm tile showed that by 20 \u00b5s, the strength of the material \nMaterials and Design Vol. 29 (8), pp. 1497 \u2013 1503 \n 16\ntowards the periphery of the tile reduced to zero. This was due to the release of pressure due to \nthe proximity of the free surface. Towards the centre of the tile, the pressure was c. 0.2-0.4 GPa \ndue to the penetrating projectile. Whereas with the 7.5 mm \u220585 mm tile the strength measured at \n16.5 mm from the axis of penetration was c. 2-3 GPa; pressure along the axis of penetration was \nconsiderably higher than with the 33 mm tile and was computed to be 4-8 GPa close to the \ncontact interface between the projectile and the target. Consequently, retaining the comminuted \nceramic in place by virtue of the inertial confinement offered by the larger tile resulted in an \nincreased computed pressure and consequently an increased computed strength of the damaged \nmaterial.  \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nExperiments have been carried out on two differently made silicon carbides to evaluate the \neffect of border proximity on each material\u2019s ballistic performance. Further, a series of \ncomputations have been carried out using a commercial hydrocode to elucidate the penetration \nmechanism in two different areal sizes of tile. \n\u2022 The measured depth-of-penetration after completely penetrating 7.5-mm thick sSiC was \ndependent on the tile size. For this ceramic, the effect of the border was insignificant at a \nproximity of impact of approximately 30-35mm. Consequently, the minimum square tile-\nsize that should be used so that the intrinsic ballistic properties of this material can be \ntested is 70mm \u00d7 70mm. For a central impact on a ceramic tile used in a mosaic armour \ndesign, this was assumed to be the worst case scenario where each tile was assumed to be \nperforming independently of its neighbour.  \nMaterials and Design Vol. 29 (8), pp. 1497 \u2013 1503 \n 17\n\u2022 The sSiC out-performed the LPS SiC ballistically in the depth-of-penetration-test \nconfiguration.  \n\u2022 The LPS SiC tile showed little variation of ballistic performance with tile size. We \nbelieve that this was because the 85 mm ceramic was not able to damage the projectile\u2019s \ncore to any great extent.    \n\u2022 The computational model was able to predict the depth-of-penetration into the \npolycarbonate after completely penetrating a 7.5 mm thick, 33 mm \u00d7 33 mm tile. It \nshowed that the \u220533 mm tile accrued damage at a higher rate than the \u220585 mm tile. \nFurther, it showed that the strength of the failed damage material was considerably \nreduced by virtue of the relatively close proximity of the radial boundary. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \n Some of this work was carried out during Capt Moutinho\u2019s study for a Forensic \nEngineering and Science MSc at Cranfield University.
