If an additional term\nis added to the NLS\niA\u0001 + aA\u0002\u0002 + \u0003\u0005A\u00052A + \u0007A = 0,\nwith \u0007\u00020 then steady DSWs can exist. However, these\nwaves are steady relative to a frame moving at the group\nvelocity, since \u0002=\u0005\u0001x\u2212cgt\u0002, and are therefore unsteady as\nsolutions of the full water wave problem \u0003see Eq. \u00011.3\u0002 for\nthe role of A\u0001\u0002 ,\u0001\u0002 in the expression for the free-surface el-\nevation\u0004.\nImplicit in the defocusing NLS for water waves is wave-\ngenerated meanflow. Indeed, mean-flow generated in finite\ndepth is responsible for the change in sign of \u0003 at the critical\nvalue of k0h0. However, there is more to mean flow than the\naffect on \u0003. In the derivations of Benney and Roskes3 \u0001here-\nafter BR equation\u0002 and Hasimoto and Ono10 \u0001hereafter HO\nequation\u0002 there are one or two additional equations for mean\nflow. When full account of mean flow is included, one finds\na range of steady and unsteady DSWs, and the connection\nbetween mean flow and the generation of DSWs can be clari-\nfied.\nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the different\nclasses of DSWs that appear in modulation equations for\nStokes water waves in finite depth, with particular attention\nto the role of meanflow.

The bifurcation of these steady DSWs\noccurs when the basic Stokes wave is critical.\nAttention is restricted to water waves with constant den-\nsity and gravity forces only. When surface tension or density\nvariation is present, one can find an even wider range of\nsteady DSWs, and there is a different class of DSWs associ-\nated with bifurcations near the singularity cp=cg, where cp is\nthe phase velocity.4,9\nThe observation in Ref. 5 is that Stokes waves \u0001or in\ngeneral, steady periodic solutions of a Hamiltonian system\u0002\ncan be characterized as a three-parameter family of relative\nequilibria, and when a branch of such relative equilibria is\ndegenerate it signals criticality and a homoclinic bifurcation\n\u0001which represents a solitary wave\u0002. When the relative equi-\nlibrium is associated with a periodic solution, the homoclinic\nbifurcation results in the familiar DSW, although more gen-\neral homoclinic orbits \u0001hence solitary waves\u0002 are possible. It\nis essential to recognize all three parameters: In the modula-\ntion equation setting, three coupled equations are required.\nNeglecting one equation \u0001i.e., using HO rather than BR\u0002\nleads to a different \u0001incorrect\u0002 result.\nThe coupled HO equations are\n\u00042\b\n\u0004T2\n\u2212 gh0\n\u00042\b\n\u0004X\n=\ng\nk0\t\n\u00032\u00060k0 + \u00011 \u2212 \t2\u0002k0\n2cg\u0004\u0001\u0005A\u00052\u0002\u0002\ni\n\u0004A\n\u0004\u0001\n+ a\n\u00042A\n\u0004\u00022\n+ \n\u0005A\u00052A = \u0007k0\u0004\b\u0004X \u2212 \u00011 \u2212 \t2\u0002 k0\n2\n2\u00060\n\u0004\b\n\u0004T\bA ,\n\u00011.2\u0002\nwhere \t=tanh\u0001k0h0\u0002 , cg is the group velocity, T=\u0005t and X\n=\u0005x, and\n\n =\n1\n2\n\u00060k0\n2\n\t2\n\t\u00011 \u2212 \t2\u00022 \u2212 12\t2 \u00019 \u2212 10\t2 + 9\t4\u0002\n .\nThe function \b represents the modulation of meanflow, and\nA represents the modulation of the wave.

At leading order these generalizations result\nin two equations, a modified NLS equation plus a mean flow\nequation, and they agree with the HO equations.\nHowever, one shortcoming of the HO equations,\nBranch\u2013Nielsen and Jonsson\u2019s equations and Sedletsky\u2019s\nequations is that both components of the mean flow\u2014mean\ndepth and mean velocity\u2014are determined by one equation.\nThe modulation of mean depth is represented by \u0004\b \/\u0004T and\nthe modulation of mean velocity is represented by \u0004\b \/\u0004X.\nIn the earlier work of Benney and Roskes,3 independent\nequations are derived for modulation of mean depth and\nmean velocity.

However, it is the full triple of equations, which sepa-\nrate the two contributions to the meanflow which is the most\ngeneral and shows the full structure of the wave\u2013meanflow\ninteraction.\nThe BR equations are also valid for water waves with\nvorticity.6 To this order, vorticity has negligible effect on the\nwave or mean flow modulation.\nThe wave\u2013meanflow interaction includes a periodic so-\nlution \u0001due to wave modulation\u0002 coupled to drift along two\ndirections of meanflow. A model for this is a Hamiltonian\nsystem with a three-dimensional symmetry group S1\rR2,\nand the steady BR equations have precisely this symmetry\ngroup and the associated Hamiltonian structure.\nBased on the steady BR equations, the following model\nis proposed for the steady coupled wave\u2013meanflow system:\naAxx + 2ibAx + \u0003\u0005A\u00052A = \u2212 2\u0001\u0001hx + mux\u0002A + \u0005f1\u0001A,A\u00af ,h,u\u0002\nrhxx + cuxx = \u0001\u0001\u0005A\u00052\u0002x + \u0005f2\u0001A,A\u00af ,h,u\u0002\nchxx + suxx = m\u0001\u0005A\u00052\u0002x + \u0005f3\u0001A,A\u00af ,h,u\u0002 , \u00011.9\u0002\nwhere a, b, \u0003, \u0001, m, r, s, and c are given \u0001in general nonzero\u0002\nreal parameters with rs\u2212c2\u00020, and the functions f j , j=1,2,3\nare symmetry breaking functions.\nWhen \u0005=0, this system is a generalization of the steady\nBR equations which are obtained by letting a0=u and b0\n=h\u0002 and by differentiating the first equation in \u00011.8\u0002. Note\nthat h is a potential for the modulation of mean depth, in the\nsame way the u is a potential for the modulation of mean\nvelocity. \u0001See Ref. 5 for a discussion of the role of potentials\nfor elevation functions.\u0002 The steady BR system is recovered\nby taking \u0005=0 and\nnloaded 01 May 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

HAMILTONIAN STRUCTURE OF THE MODEL\nEQUATION\nThe Hamiltonian formulation of the system \u00011.9\u0002 when\n\u0005=0 can be obtained by first writing down the Lagrangian\nformulation and taking a Legendre transform. Introduce real\ncoordinates,\nA = q1 + iq2, h = q3 and u = q4, q = \u0001q1,q2,q3,q4\u0002 ,\nthen the real form of \u00011.9\u0002 is generated by the Lagrangian\nL\u0001q,qx\u0002 =\n1\n2\na\u0007\u0007dq1dx \b\n2\n+ \u0007dq2dx \b\n2\b \u2212 b\u0007q2dq1dx \u2212 q1dq2dx \b\n\u2212 \u0007\u0001dq3dx + mdq4dx \b\u0001q12 + q22\u000212r\u0007dq3dx \b\n2\n+ c\u0007dq3dx \b\u0007dq4dx \b + 12s\u0007dq4dx \b\n2\n\u2212\n1\n4\n\u0003\u0001q1\n2 + q2\n2\u00022.\nBy taking the Legendre transform, momenta p\n= \u0001p1 , p2 , p3 , p4\u0002 are obtained with\np1 = a\ndq1\ndx\n\u2212 bq2,\np2 = a\ndq2\ndx\n+ bq1\np3 = r\ndq3\ndx\n+ c\ndq4\ndx\n\u2212 \u0001\u0001q1\n2 + q2\n2\u0002,\np4 = s\ndq4\ndx\n+ c\ndq3\ndx\n\u2212 m\u0001q1\n2 + q2\n2\u0002 .\nHence if sr\u2212c2\u00020, the derivatives of qj , j=1,\u2026,4 can be\nexpressed in terms of q and p.

CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe defocusing NLS, the HO equations and the BR\nequations clearly have steady DSWs. However, can they\nhave DSWs that are also steady relative to the Stokes wave?\nTo find these latter waves, it is appropriate to consider the\nmodulation equations before shifting to a moving frame.\nStarting with the original BR Eqs. \u00011.6\u0002 set all time deriva-\ntives to zero.

However,\nthe appearance of \u0005 in the denominator of the coefficient of\nAX shows that there is an imbalance in the space scales.\nIndeed, starting from the full steady water wave problem one\nfinds AX=0 at first order. In other words, for purely steady\nwaves a different modulation equation is required. The\nmodulation equations of HO and BR and other NLS based\nmodels are instrinsically unsteady.\nA similar problem arises when one considers the stability\nof DSWs. The unsteady DSW solutions of \u00011.1\u0002 are longitu-\ndinally stable \u0001Barashenkov1\u0002. \u0001They can, however, be un-\nstable to transverse perturbations \u0001cf.

When coupled to mean flow equations, the sta-\nbility properties of steady DSWs are unknown. To demon-\nstrate stability or instability in the modulation equation set-\nting requires an appropriate time evolution equation.

Existing modulation equa-\ntions for time-dependent wave\u2013meanflow interaction have\nmixed levels of time scales, and so may not be conclusive\nwith regard to the stability question for steady DSWs\ncoupled to a mean flow.
