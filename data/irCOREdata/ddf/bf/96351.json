NEEO is the\nflagship project of the Nereus Consortium and aims\nto create a central multilingual portal, Economists\nOnline (EO).1\nEO is based on the content of the institutional\nrepository partners, who are:\nTilburg University (The Netherlands) \u2013 Coordinator\nLondon School of Economics and Political Science\n(UK)\nErasmus University Rotterdam (The Netherlands)\nGerman National Library of Economics\/Kiel\nInstitute for the World Economy (Germany) \nSciences Po (France) \nUniversit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium)\nUniversity College Dublin (Ireland) \nUniversity College London (UK)\nUniversity of Oxford (UK) \nUniversity of Warwick (UK)\nKatholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium) \nMaastricht University (The Netherlands)\nUniversidad Carlos III de Madrid (Spain)\nCharles University in Prague, CERGE (Czech\nRepublic)\nUniversit\u00e9 Toulouse 1 Sciences Sociales (France)\nUniversit\u00e9 Paris Dauphine (France) \nUniversit\u00e4t Konstanz (Germany)\nUniversit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain (Belgium) \nUniversit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve (Switzerland) \nColumbia University (US) \nEuropean University Institute (International). \nIt takes an international, subject-oriented approach\nwhich aims to set standards, guarantee the quality\nof the information and, as a result, provide a frame-\nwork that can act as a model for others to follow.\nThe content from the partner institutions is comple-\nmented by other open access economics content\nincluding RePEc (Research Papers in Economics).\nThe portal aims to provide an appropriate, reliable\nand sustainable service to various user communities,\nincluding but not limited to researchers, students\nand policy-makers in the public and private sectors.\nOne of the central objectives of the project was to\nsystematically identify the needs of these users.\nThe project consists of three user studies. The first\naimed to address the following:\n1. Current researchers\u2019 needs for access to full-\ntext documents and statistical datasets.\n2. Current researchers\u2019 needs for storing and\ndisseminating the full-text documents and stat-\nistical datasets they have produced.\nEconomists Online: user requirements\nfor a subject repository\nThe Network of European Economists Online (NEEO) project is a \n30-month project running from September 2007 \u2013 February 2010. NEEO\naims to create a central multilingual portal, Economists Online (EO), with\nenhanced metadata descriptions and links to the full-text research\npublications and primary data output of at least 500 top researchers and\nthe economics publications of partner institutions.\nIn late 2007 the first user requirements study was undertaken to identify\nthe needs of economics researchers regarding access to full-text\ndocuments and datasets; dissemination of research outputs; services to be\nimplemented in EO; and any multilingual issues. A follow-up mid-project\nquestionnaire was conducted in early 2009 in order to obtain early\nfeedback from users of EO and identify any necessary refinements.A third\nevaluation questionnaire will be conducted near the end of the project.\nThis article presents the results of the first two of these studies.\nMICHELLE BLAKE\nLiaison & Service\nDevelopment Manager\nLondon School of Economics\n& Political Science\nSerials \u2013 22(3), November 2009 Michelle Blake Economists Online: user requirements\n207\n3. Services to be implemented in EO.\n4. Relevant multilingual and cultural issues.\nThe second user requirements study was under-\ntaken halfway through the project after the initial\nversion of the portal was running so that feedback\ncould be obtained to allow for early refinements to\nbe made. A third evaluation study will be\nconducted near the end of the project to consider\nthe impact and success of the portal. \nThis article presents the results of the first two of\nthese studies, which were carried out between\nSeptember 2007 \u2013 January 2008 and March \u2013 May\n2009 respectively. \nRespondents for both the initial user require-\nments and for the follow-up mid-project study\nwere very similar overall (see Table 1). Most\nrespondents were academic staff (68% in 2008; 41%\nin 2009) and between 25 and 34 years old (35% in\n2008; 37% in 2009). Respondents from the UK were\nquite prominent in both studies (13.3% in 2008;\n18.4% in 2009) although the majority of respondents\ncame from Spain in 2008 (25%), and the Czech\nRepublic in 2009 (22%). In the 2009 study a total of\n73% of respondents were either currently pro-\nducing or expected to produce research outputs.\nThis is slightly lower than the first study in 2008,\nwhere 91% of respondents were either producing\nor were likely to produce such outputs. Only 6% \nof respondents indicated they were unlikely to\nproduce research outputs in the future in 2008 com-\npared with 20% of respondents in 2009, however,\nthis figure is likely to be associated with the fact\nthat 21% of respondents were librarians or\ninformation professionals in 2009.\nThe majority of respondents in the second study\nindicated that they produce research outputs in\nEnglish (91%). However, publication in other\nlanguages was common: 13% of respondents\npublished in French, 12% in German, 8% in\nSpanish and 11% in other languages (including\nDutch, Russian, Romanian and Italian). These\nTable 1.

This illustrates the diversity of the audience\nwhose needs EO is designed to meet.\nContent\nRespondents to the online survey (see Figure 1)\nand participants of focus groups agreed that the\nresearch material planned for inclusion in EO was\nvery comprehensive, comprising journal articles,\nbooks, book chapters, working papers, discussion\npapers, theses, conference proceedings and\ndatasets. In fact, 91.6% of the online survey\nrespondents stated there was no need to include\nother types of research output in the service.\nHowever, when users were asked in the second\nstudy if the portal provided a good selection of\ncontent across the various types of material it\naimed to include, the results were less promising.\nWhen comparing these findings with that of the\nfirst study in 2008, 26% of respondents found\nworking papers hard to access and 21% found\ndiscussion papers hard to access. Respondents in\n2009 valued the portal most highly in these areas.\nWhile journal articles were considered the least\ndifficult to access online in 2008 (only 2.6% of\nrespondents reported difficulties), EO is also\nconsidered relatively strong in providing this\nmaterial.\nThe first study found that book chapters and\nbooks were considered most difficult to access\nonline (with 67% and 66% of respondents\nrespectively considering such materials difficult to\nlocate). As a result, EO appears to have not yet\nexploited its potential added value in this area. The\ninterest in books and book chapters reflects the\nlimited availability of economics books online; for\nexample, only 0.2% of the entire RePEc database\ncorresponds to downloadable books2. However,\nmost interviewees were doubtful whether free\naccess to such material could be achievable due to\ncopyright concerns and commercial interests from\nboth authors and publishers. \nConference proceedings, discussion and working\npapers were of interest to the interviewees in as\nmuch as they usually contain ongoing research\nand could therefore provide an overview of\ncurrent topical and methodological trends within\nthe field of economics, as well as of the research\nprocess followed by some well-known authors. \nOf the three of them, conference proceedings\nappeared to be the most easily accessible online;\nhowever, it was mentioned that although conference\norganizers usually put the presentations online,\nthose papers do not tend to be complete \u2013 they are\nEconomists Online: user requirements Michelle Blake Serials \u2013 22(3), November 2009\n208\nFigure 1.

Responses are ranked by average score in descending order.\nmostly limited to abstracts or summaries \u2013 nor are\nthey accessible for long periods of time. In\naddition, although discussion and working papers\nare more easily accessible through institutional\nand personal websites, some researchers were\ninterested in accessing other kinds of \u2018working\npapers\u2019, understood as specialized technical reports\nproduced for governmental and private institutions\n(usually evaluation and consulting reports), which\nare currently difficult to access online.\nAlthough theses were reported as one of the\nmost difficult outputs to access online, they were\nnot as highly valued as other research outputs. \nDatasets\nThe first study asked respondents about access to\ndatasets. Respondents indicated that if the service\ncould not only link articles to their respective\ndatasets but also offer a datasets portal, then it\nwould be a key feature of Economists Online. \nHowever, when dataset creators were asked if\nthey would be willing to submit their datasets into\nan institutional repository, Figure 2 shows that\nthere was a reluctance to do so (only 29% indicated\nthey would be willing to submit all their datasets).\nWhen respondents were asked to state under what\nconditions they would be willing to submit their\ndatasets, 75% wanted a clear statement of dataset\ncreators\u2019 rights. They also desired a mechanism \nto control how end-users would access datasets in\nEO, either by stating clearly the permissions in\nplace to use the data (64.9%) or by making\nregistration compulsory (36.8%). In contrast, only a\nminority (23.7%) of respondents were happy to\nmake all datasets available.\nFigure 3 shows that dataset creators appear to\nhave two main concerns in relation to submitting\ntheir work to EO: the risk of not being credited for\ntheir work, and losing the opportunity of\nproducing more results based on their data. Even \nif a researcher had already produced an article,\ngiving away his\/her data might allow other\nresearchers to produce a similar piece of work\nmore quickly than the dataset creator. \nSerials \u2013 22(3), November 2009 Michelle Blake Economists Online: user requirements\n209\nFigure 2. Disposition to submit produced datasets into a repository\nFigure 3. Conditions demanded before submitting datasets\nIn addition to losing the opportunity of\nproducing more research outputs, participants also\nfeared that free access to datasets might facilitate \na widespread use of their work without any\nrecognition. The central role datasets play in\nempirical research means they were not seen solely\nas an input for publications but also as a product in\nthemselves, whose authorship needs to be credited.\nThe general consensus, then, was that researchers\nwould be willing to include datasets in EO only \nif creators are guaranteed proper acknowledge-\nment. \nThe most common mechanism by which\nparticipants thought the above concerns could be\nsomewhat minimized was to wait until their own\nresearch was released, preferably through an\narticle in a peer-reviewed journal. \nDatasets for the project will be linked from\narticles in EO and will be stored in a DataVerse\nrepository3.\nServices\nDuring the second study, users were asked about a\nrange of services which had been implemented\ninto the first version of EO. It should be noted that,\nsince the user study was completed, substantial\nchanges have been made to the interface of EO,\nsome of which were based on feedback received\nfrom this study.\nIn the 2008 study (see Figure 4), respondents\nreported that searches by author, title, full text,\nabstract and subject were the most valuable search\noptions. These requirements were confirmed in the\nsecond user study of current and proposed facet\noptions. Initially, a search by date and Journal of\nEconomic Literature (JEL) code were considered less\nvaluable. However, the findings suggest that while\nusers continue to favour the JEL search option less,\nthey actually do value searches by date in the\ncurrent version of the gateway.\nThe 2008 study found that respondents most\nfavoured links to full-text for freely available titles\n(see Figure 5). This service also proved most\npopular in the survey results from 2009. Similarly,\nin 2008 users favoured links to fee-based\npublications less, a service that has also proven less\npopular in the first version of the portal.\nMetrics\nOnly a minority of economists surveyed in 2008\nreported having access to information on how\noften their work is cited or used (37%). Existing or\nlikely contributors to EO were asked what kinds of\nmetrics they would find useful in relation to their\npublications. The most popular metric was total\nnumber of downloads, followed by downloads by\nmonth\/year and the number of unique individuals\naccessing work. Less popular was the country of\nEconomists Online: user requirements Michelle Blake Serials \u2013 22(3), November 2009\n210\nFigure 4. User ratings \u2013 facet options\nNOTE: N=76.

However, only a minority\n(30%) estimated that all their outputs were access-\nible in this manner. Discussion papers and working\npapers are commonly freely accessible online, while\njournal articles are not traditionally open access.\nThe survey questions did not ask respondents to\ndifferentiate between types of research output they\nproduced or made open access. However, analysis\nof the pilot EO service metadata records conducted\nfor the JISC-funded VERSIONS Project suggests\nthat 23% of EO authors\u2019 research outputs were\ndiscussion papers and working papers4.\nFocus group participants expressed the view\nthat one of the main reasons for this patchy use \nof open access services was copyright. Although\nparticipants said they do make the great majority\nof their discussion and working papers available to\nanyone interested, they expressed serious concerns\nabout their right to provide final drafts of articles\npublished in peer-reviewed journals or books\nbecause of potentially breaching any previous\nagreement with publishers. \nRespondents were asked in the 2008 study to\nindicate the search services they use when con-\nducting research. Figure 7 shows that the most\npopular search services were Google and Google\nScholar, followed by RePEc and the Social Science\nResearch Network (SSRN). Therefore, it was not\nunexpected that when researchers were asked to\nstate through which online services they would\nlike to see their work disseminated, the majority\npreferred Google and Google Scholar alongside\nmore specialized online bibliographic databases\nsuch as RePEc and SSRN. Library services such as\ncatalogues, databases or repositories were of less\nimportance for respondents. \nThree questions sought user feedback on the\nvalue of the EO portal for the dissemination of\ntheir work. Firstly, respondents were asked if they\nhad already contributed, or were planning to con-\ntribute, to EO, and if they believed the service\nwould increase the visibility of their work.\nOf the individuals who were not yet con-\ntributors, 88% believed that it would increase the\nvisibility of their work. This provides strong\nsupport in favour of the portal. \nSecondly, users were asked, if they had not yet\ncontributed to EO, would they be willing to submit\ntheir research to this open access service? 89% indi-\ncated that they would be willing to do this. Again,\nthis shows strong support among the target\ncommunity for the EO service.\nFinally, the survey asked whether participants\nwould recommend participating in EO to a\ncolleague. Most respondents (73%) indicated that\nthey would do so \u2013 indicating widespread positive\nsupport for the portal. \nConclusion\nThe two user studies that have been completed have\nbeen able to inform the development of the EO portal. \nThe portal that was used for the 2009 survey was a\nFigure 7.
