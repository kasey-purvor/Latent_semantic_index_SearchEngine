INTRODUCTION \nONUNIFORM filter banks are important not only because \nthey are widely employed in audio, radar and \ntransmultiplexing applications, but they could achieve more \ngeneral time and frequency tiling in which conventional tree \nstructured two channel filter banks could not [1], [2].  \nHowever, there is a kind of nonuniform filter banks, called \nincompatible nonuniform filter banks [3], which do not \nachieve perfect reconstruction via non-ideal LTI filters and \nconventional samplers (without expanding the channels) [3]. \nThere are two common approaches for tackling the perfect \nreconstruction problem. The first approach is to convert the \nnonuniform filter banks to uniform filter banks [3]. This \napproach is regarded as an indirect approach. Although the \ntotal number of filter coefficients of the corresponding \nuniform filter banks is the same as that of filter banks we \npropose via direct approaches in this brief, the number of \nchannels of the corresponding uniform filter banks is equal to \nthe least common multiple (LCM) of the set of decimation \nintegers of the nonuniform filter banks. Sometimes, the LCM \nof the set of decimation integers could be very large. For \nexample, for this set of decimation integers {2,5,7,10,35,35}, \nthe LCM is 70. This implies that 70 channels are required for \nthe implementation of the corresponding uniform filter bank. \nCompared to the original 6 channel nonuniform filter bank, \nthe design of the circuit layout of the corresponding uniform \nfilter bank is more complicated because more filters and \nsamplers are required to be connected together. For the \nsecond approach, the LTI filters and the conventional \nsamplers are generalized to linear dual rate systems [4]. Linear \ndual rate systems are linear systems for which shifting an \ninput by n  samples resulting in shifting an output by m  \nsamples. There are three common realizations for linear dual \nrate systems. The first realization is to represent a linear dual \nrate system via a linear time periodic varying (LTPV) \nsubsystem and a set of block samplers. For this realization, the \ninput output relationship of the LTPV subsystem is no longer \ngoverned by the multiplication of its input and its frequency \nresponse. However, the fundamental working principle of \nfilter banks is to decompose an input signal into different \nfrequency bands and different processing units are tailored \nbased on the characteristics of the decomposed subband \nsignals. Hence, this realization would cause difficulties for the \ndesign of the subband processing units. The second realization \nis to represent a linear dual rate system via a vector sample \nrate changer. The dimension of the LTI filter in the vector \nsample rate changer depends on the highest common factor \n(HCF) of m  and n , where m  and n  are defined as above. The \nlast realization is to represent a linear dual rate system via a \nlinear switching time varying subsystem and a set of \nconventional samplers. The linear switching time varying \nsubsystem is further realized via a parallel connection of LTI \nfilters and a set of conventional samplers. The number of LTI \nfilters required for the realization is also equal to the HCF of \nm  and n , where m  and n  are defined as above. For the \nsecond and the third realizations, although LTI filters are \nemployed, the input output dimension of the subsystem \nrequired for the representations is expanded and equal to the \nHCF of m  and n . Similar to the indirect approach, sometimes \nthe HCF of m  and n  may be very large and these two \napproaches require complicated design of the circuit layout. \nRepresentations of Linear Dual Rate System via \nSingle SISO LTI Filter, Conventional Sampler \nand Block Sampler \nC.

TamP3 P, Member, IEEE \nN \nThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue. \n \n \n2\n2\nThe outline of this brief is as follows. Notations and \ndefinitions used throughout this brief are introduced in \nSection II. In Section III, a linear dual rate system is proved to \nbe possible to be represented via a series cascade of (i) a \nconventional expander, an SISO LTI filter and a block \ndecimator, or (ii) a block expander, an SISO LTI filter and a \nconventional decimator. In Section IV, an incompatible \nnonuniform filter bank is shown to achieve perfect \nreconstruction via LTI filters, conventional samplers and \nblock samplers. Finally, a conclusion is drawn in Section V. \nII. NOTATIONS AND DEFINITIONS \nDenote N  as the number of channels of a nonuniform filter \nbank. Denote ( )zHi  and ( )zFi  for 1,,1,0 \u2212= Ni L  as \nrespectively, the analysis and synthesis filters, where ( )zHi  \nand ( )zFi  for 1,,1,0 \u2212= Ni L  are assumed to be LTI filters. A \nconventional decimator with a decimation integer ip  and a \nconventional expander with an expansion integer ip  are \ndenoted as, respectively, ip\u2193  and ip\u2191 . A block decimator \nwith a block length q  and a decimation integer ip , and a \nblock expander with a block length q  and an expansion \ninteger ip  are denoted as, respectively, ( )qpi ,\u2193  and ( )qpi ,\u2191 . \nIt is worth noting that when q  is equal to 1, the block \nsamplers reduce to the conventional samplers [5], [6]. \nFor a maximally decimated nonuniform filter bank with \ndecimation integers ip  for 1,,1,0 \u2212= Ni L , denote il  as an \ninteger such that { }1,,1,0 \u2212\u2208 ii pl L . If for every ip  and \n{ }1,,1,0 \u2212\u2208 ii pl L , there exists jp  and { }1,,1,0 \u2212\u2208 jj pl L  such \nthat ji \u2260  and \nj\nj\ni\ni\np\nl\np\nl = , then the nonuniform filter bank is \ncalled a compatible nonuniform filter bank. Otherwise, it is \ncalled an incompatible nonuniform filter bank [3]. \nIII. REPRESENTATIONS OF A LINEAR DUAL RATE SYSTEM VIA \nAN SISO LTI FILTER, A CONVENTIONAL SAMPLER AND A \nBLOCK SAMPLER \nA. Motivation \nA linear dual rate system can always be represented via a \nkernel function g  such that \n\u2211\u221e+\n\u221e\u2192\n=\n-\n][u],[g]y[\nl\nllkk , \u0396\u2208\u2200k , (1) \nwhere ][u l  and ]y[k\n \nare the input and the output of the linear \ndual rate system, respectively. Since linear dual rate systems \nare defined as shifting an input by n  samples resulting in \nshifting an output by m  samples, we have \n]g[]g[ ,, nllk mk ++= , \u0396\u2208\u2200 lk, . (2) \nFor a conventional m\/n  rate changer with m\u2191 , an LTI filter \nwith an impulse response ]f[k   and n\u2193  [4], the input output \nrelationship is: \n\u2211\u221e+\n\u2212\u221e\u2192\n\u2212=\nl\nllmkn ][u][f[k]y , \u0396\u2208\u2200k . (3) \nIf the linear dual rate system can be represented via the \nconventional m\/n  rate changer, then the transformation \nbetween ],[ lkg  and ]f[l  is: \n]g[]f[ , lklmnk =\u2212 , \u0396\u2208\u2200 lk, . (4) \nHowever, according to the Euclid\u2019s theorem, the mapping \nfrom { } \u0396\u00d7\u22121,,1,0 mL  to \u0396 , where { } \u0396\u00d7\u2212\u2208 1,,1,0][ , mlk L  and \n\u0396\u2208\u2212 lmkn , is bijective if and only if m  and n  are co-prime. \nHence, linear dual rate systems can be realized via \nconventional m\/n  rate changers if and only if m  and n  are co-\nprime [4]. \nThe mapping between ]g[ , lk  and ]f[k  is illustrated in Figure \n1. The x-axis and the y-axis of Figure 1 are the time indices l  \nand k , respectively. The value located at ( )kl,  is ]g[ , lk . Since \nfor a given time index ( )kl, , it corresponds to a unique time \nindex lmkn \u2212 . Hence, ]g[ , lk  also corresponds to a unique \nvalue of ]f[ lmnk \u2212 . Figure 1 shows the values of ]f[ lmnk \u2212  at \ndifferent time indices ( )kl, . Figure 1a shows the case when m  \nand n  are co-prime. Since linear dual rate systems satisfy (2), \nshifting Figure 1a by n  samples horizontally and m  samples \nvertically will correspond to the same figure. It can be seen \nfrom Figure 1a that ]f[ lmnk \u2212  is periodic with a horizontal \nperiod n  and a vertical period m , and the conventional m\/n  \nrate changer is ),( nm  shift invariant. Figure 1b shows the case \nwhen n  is an integer multiple of m  with the factor c , that is \ncmn = . When the time index ( )kl,  is shifted horizontally by c  \nand vertically by 1, l  becomes cl +  and k  becomes 1+k . \nHence, lmkn \u2212  becomes ( ) ( )mclnk +\u2212+1 , which is equal to \nlmkn \u2212  because cmn = . Consequently, ]f[ lmnk \u2212  has a \nhorizontal period c  and a vertical period 1, and the \nconventional m\/n  rate changer is )1( ,c  shift invariant, instead \nof ),( cmm  shift invariant. This implies that the conventional \nm\/n  rate changer cannot represent a general ),( cmm  shift \ninvariant linear dual rate system. Figure 1c shows the case \nwhen m  is an integer multiple of n  with the factor c , that is \ncnm = . When the time index ( )kl,  is shifted horizontally by 1 \nand vertically by c , l  becomes 1+l  and k  becomes ck + . \nHence, lmkn \u2212  becomes ( ) ( )mlnck 1+\u2212+ , which is equal to \nlmkn \u2212  because cnm = . Consequently, ]f[ lmnk \u2212  has a \nhorizontal period 1 and a vertical period c , and the \nconventional m\/n  rate changer is )1,(c  shift invariant, instead \nof ),( ncn  shift invariant. This implies that the conventional \nm\/n  rate changer cannot represent a general ),( ncn  shift \ninvariant linear dual rate system. Figure 1d shows the case \nwhen nm = . When the time index ( )kl,  is shifted both \nhorizontally and vertically by 1, l  becomes 1+l  and k  \nbecomes 1+k . Hence, lmkn \u2212  becomes ( ) ( )mlnk 11 +\u2212+ , \nwhich is equal to lmkn \u2212  because nm = . Consequently, \n]f[ lmnk \u2212  has the trivial horizontal period 1 and vertical period \n1, and the conventional m\/n  rate changer is )1,1(  shift \ninvariant, instead of ),( nn  shift invariant, or n  time periodic \nvarying. This implies that the conventional m\/n  rate changer \nThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue. \n \n \n3\n3\ncannot represent a general ),( nn  shift invariant linear dual rate \nsystem. \nB. First proposed representation \nTheorem 1 \n+\u0396\u2208\u2200 nm,  (no matter m  and n  are co-prime or not), all \nlinear dual rate systems can be represented via a series \ncascade of m\u2191 , followed by an LTI filter with an impulse \nresponse ]f[k , and then followed by ( )mn,\u2193 . \nProof: \nThe input output relationship of all linear dual rate systems \nis: \n\u2211\u221e+\n\u221e\u2192\n\u2212=+\n-\n][u],[g]y[\nl\nlknliikm\n, \u0396\u2208\u2200 lk , , +\u0396\u2208\u2200 nm,  and 1,,1,0 \u2212= mi L .

Hence, \u0396\u2208\u2200 lk, , +\u0396\u2208\u2200 nm,  and 1,,1,0 \u2212= mi L , \nthere exists a unique time index imlkmn +\u2212  corresponding to \nthe time index ][ , knli \u2212 . As a result, there exists an LTI filter \nwith an impulse response ][f k\n \nsatisfying: \n],[g][f knliimlkmn \u2212=+\u2212 , \u0396\u2208\u2200 lk , , +\u0396\u2208\u2200 nm,  and 1,,1,0 \u2212= mi L ,(7) \nthat the linear dual rate systems and the proposed \nrepresentation are input output equivalent.

This completes the \nproof. \u2584 \nD. Discussions and verifications \n It is worth noting that one of the existing realizations of \nlinear dual rate systems also involves block samplers, but it \nstill requires an LTPV subsystem with its periodicity equal to \nthe HCF of m  and n . On the other hand, our proposed \nrealizations do not involve LTPV subsystem. This is because \nthe symmetric representation of the existing realization \ncannot cancel the HCF of m  and n . On the other hand, our \nproposed representations are asymmetric so that they can \ncancel the HCF of m  and n . Therefore, we can simply \nemploy an LTI filter, which is generally simpler than the \nLTPV or linear switching time varying counterparts, as its \nimpulse and frequency responses are more easily exploited. \nTo verify our proposed representations, the conventional \nsamplers and the block samplers are represented via matrix \nforms because they are both linear systems. Let ji,I  be an i  by \nj  matrix with its upper rightmost element being 1 and 0 \nelsewhere. Similarly, let ji ,I\u2032  be an i  by j  matrix with \ndiagonal elements equal to 1 and 0 elsewhere. m\u2191  can be \nrepresented as: \n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n=\nM\nM\nOO\nO\nO\nOO\nM\nM\nu[1]\n]0u[\ny[1]\n]0y[\n1,\n1,\nm\nm\nI0\n0I , (8) \nwhile ( )mn,\u2193  can be represented as: \n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2032\n\u2032=\nM\nM\nOO\nO\nO\nOO\nM\nM\nu[1]\n]0u[\ny[1]\n]0y[\n,\n,\nnmm\nnmm\nI0\n0I .

PERFECT RECONSTRUCTION OF INCOMPATIBLE \nNONUNIFORM FILTER BANKS \nFor a given analysis bank with an incompatible set of \ndecimation integers as well as a desirable delay and an \noverall gain of the whole system (including both the analysis \nand the synthesis banks), by converting the analysis bank to a \nuniform filter bank, if the corresponding polyphase matrix is \nfull rank for all frequencies, then there exists a unique \nsynthesis bank that achieves perfect reconstruction. However, \nin [4] the synthesis bank is realized via linear dual rate \nsystems. By applying the results in this brief, these linear dual \nrate systems can now be further realized via LTI filters, \nconventional samplers and block samplers. \nFor an illustration, consider the example in [4] with the set \nof decimation integers {2,3,6} and the set of analysis filters \n( ) 10 =zH , ( ) 541 \u2212\u2212 += zzzH  and ( ) 32 \u2212= zzH . Follow the \ndiscussion in [4], the synthesis bank involves three linear dual \nrate systems. The input output relationship of the first linear \ndual rate system is ( ) ( )236 \u2212\u2212= kxky , ( ) ( )2316 \u2212=+ kxky , \n( ) 026 =+ky , ( ) ( )1336 \u2212=+ kxky , ( ) ( )1346 \u2212\u2212=+ kxky  and \n( ) ( )kxky 356 =+ ; that of the second linear dual rate system is \n( ) ( )kxky 26 = , ( ) 016 =+ky , ( ) 026 =+ky , ( ) 036 =+ky , \n( ) ( )1246 +=+ kxky  and ( ) 056 =+ky ; and that of the third \nlinear dual rate system is ( ) 06 =ky , ( ) 016 =+ky , \n( ) ( )kxky =+ 26 , ( ) 036 =+ky , ( ) 046 =+ky  and \n( ) 056 =+ky . By using our first proposed realization, the \nsynthesis filters are ( ) 131210950 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 +\u2212\u2212+= zzzzzzF , ( ) 121 += zzF , and ( ) 22 \u2212= zzF , respectively. The block diagram \nof the incompatible nonuniform filter bank is shown in Figure \n2a. If our second proposed realization is employed, then the \nsynthesis filters are ( ) 151310520 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 +\u2212++\u2212= zzzzzzF , \n( ) 71 1 \u2212+= zzF , and ( ) 22 \u2212= zzF , respectively. The block \ndiagram of the incompatible nonuniform filter bank is shown \nin Figure 2b. It is worth noting that the lengths of the \ncorresponding filters in these two proposed representations \nare the same because ]g[ , lk  of the corresponding linear dual \nrate systems in these two proposed representations are the \nsame. However, the time indices of the coefficients of the \ncorresponding filters in these two representations are \ndifferent because the mappings between ]g[ , lk  and ]f[k  in \nthese two representations are different. Hence, the frequency \nresponses of the corresponding filters in these two \nrepresentations are different. \nThere are several points of views for investigations of \nimplementation complexity issues. One is from a software \npoint of view and the other is from a hardware point of view. \nFrom a software point of view, the implementation \ncomplexities could refer to the operation counts, etc, in which \nthey are dependent on the filter lengths. Form a hardware \npoint of view, the implementation complexities could refer to \nthe number of connections, etc. The number of connections \nof the proposed representations is directly proportional to the \nnumber of channels of the nonuniform filter banks, while that \nof the nonuniform filter banks realized via linear dual rate \nsystems is directly proportional to the LCM of the set of the \ndecimation integers. Hence, our proposed representations \ncould reduce the number of connections significantly. \nFor design issues, the design of analysis filters can be \nformulated as a semi-infinite programming problem with the \nobjective being minimizing the total ripple energy of \nindividual filters subject to continuous constraints defined \nbased on the bounds on the maximum ripple magnitudes. The \nsemi-infinite programming problem can be solved via the \ndual parameterization method [7]. Once the analysis filters \nare designed, the synthesis filters could be uniquely derived \nusing our proposed representations and perfect reconstruction \ncan be guaranteed. Since no iteration is required between the \ndesign of the analysis bank and the synthesis bank, the \nconvergent problem occurred in traditional design methods \nbased on near perfect reconstruction approaches would not \noccur. \nConsider a design of an incompatible nonuniform filter \nbank with decimation integers {2,3,6}. The bandwidth of the \nfilters are \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n2\n,0 \u03c0 , \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n6\n5,\n2\n\u03c0\u03c0  and \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u03c0\u03c0 ,\n6\n5 . The transition \nbandwidth of all the filters is \u03c005.0 . The specifications on \nthe bounds on the maximum passband and stopband ripple \nmagnitudes of all filters are 0.3 and 0.4, respectively. The \nfilter length of all filters is 6. By applying our proposed \nrepresentations on realizing the synthesis bank, the synthesis \nfilters can be derived uniquely and perfect reconstruction is \nguaranteed. \nV. CONCLUSIONS \nThe main contribution of this brief is to represent linear \ndual rate systems via a series cascade of (i) a conventional \nexpander, an LTI filter and a block decimator, or (ii) a block \nexpander, an LTI filter and a conventional decimator. The \ndifference between our proposed representations and that of \nthe existing one is that an SISO LTI filter is employed in our \nproposed representations, whereas an LTPV subsystem, a \nlinear switching time varying subsystem or a multiple input \nmultiple output LTI subsystem is required for the existing \nrealizations. These existing representations would expand the \ninput output dimension of the subsystem and cause the \ncomplicated design of the circuit layout. On the other hand, \nour proposed realizations just involve an SISO LTI filter. \nHence, the complicated design of the circuit layout does not \noccur. Consequently, the proposed realizations of linear dual \nrate systems can thus be employed for perfect reconstruction \nof incompatible nonuniform filter banks. \nAPPENDIX A \nTo show that \u0396\u2208\u2200 lk, , +\u0396\u2208\u2200 nm,  and 1,,1,0 \u2212= mi L , the \nThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue. \n \n \n5\n5\nmapping from { } \u0396\u00d7\u22121,,1,0 mL  to \u0396 , where \n{ } \u0396\u00d7\u2212\u2208\u2212 1,,1,0][ , mi knl L  and \u0396\u2208+\u2212 imlkmn , is bijective, \nfirst assume that ( ) ( ) { } \u0396\u00d7\u2212\u2208 1,,1,02211 ,,, mzizi L  where ( ) ( )2211 ,, zizi \u2260  and 2211 imzimz +\u2212=+\u2212 .
