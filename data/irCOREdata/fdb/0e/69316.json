Their reported performance on key metrics such\nas hit rate varies greatly. In order to optimise the design of the cache network this\nvariation needs to be understood. The variation in hit rate across a number of caches is\ninvestigated and is shown to be partly stochastic (i.e caused by insufficient sample size)\nand partly fractal (i.e deterministic in origin).\n1.Introduction.\nAs the World Wide Web becomes more widely used, its performance as a large-scale distributed\ninformation system needs to be accurately modelled in order to optimise the system performance\nand minimise cost. Cache servers are a key component as they have been shown to improve\nperformance and minimise network traffic, by caching frequently requested files close to the\nclients [ABR95] [BAE97]. However, cache behavior is difficult to model because cache\nperformance indicators (i.e. hit rate, throughput rates) are highly variable. In order to construct\naccurate models the variation needs to be better understood.\n2. Inter-cache differences.\nThis paper investigates inter-cache variation in hit rate and neglects differences in other\nparameters which vary in a similar manner. Effects due to differences in hardware and software\nwere removed from enquiries by only considering caches with similar implementations and no\nhardware resource constraints such as disk space. In an attempt to maximise variation the caches\ninvestigated were chosen to represent a wide range of user communities. The caches investigated\n(all SQUID [WES96]) were:\nNLANR (sv). A parent for many caches worldwide located at NASA-Ames\/FIX-West in Silicon\nValley\nEdinburgh. Used by the staff and students of the University of Edinburgh, UK.\nHuman Genome Mapping Project (HGMP). Used by scientists working on the HGMP project in\nthe U.K.\nKorea. The Nowcom cache in Soeul, Korea.\nACT. Used by a number of educational institutions in Canberra, Australia.\nJANET. The UK Academic and Research Community web cache.\nSwinburne. Serves Swinburne university in Australia\nQuest. Serves Queenslands education and science institutions.\nHit rates at caches exhibit a high degree of inter-cache variation [DUS97]. Figure 1 shows the\nmean and variance of the hit rate of 6 caches for October 1997. The caches investigated were\nfound to have hit rates between 16% and 53% with a mean of around 30%. It is generally\nthought that cache hit rates seldom exceed hit rates of 50% even with infinite disk space\n[ABR95] [DUS97], and hit rates of less than 20% are also rarely seen, so the sample has\ncaptured a reasonable level of variation for further investigation\nFigure 1. Hit Rate Statistics at 6 Proxy Servers.\n \nThe large difference in the variance of the hit rates for the 6 caches is remarkable, variance\nincreases 60 fold between caches. Since the largest site has the smallest variance and the smallest\nsite has the largest variance the high degree of variation in hit rates could be simply due to poor\n0.0%\n10.0%\n20.0%\n30.0%\n40.0%\n50.0%\n60.0%\n70.0% Hit rate (mean)\nHit rate (StDev)\n1.6 million \nrequests \/ day\n0.9 million \nrequests \/ day\n0.6 million \nrequests \/ day\n0.15 million \nrequests \/ \nday\n24 thousand \nrequests \/ day\n24 thousand \nrequests \/day\nstatistics, but the link between variance and cache usage does not appear to be strong.\nThe relationship between number of requests and variance in hit rate was further investigated by\nplotting variance divided by hit rate, against the number of requests received, for a range of sites\n(Fig 2). For all curves the leftmost point is averaged over one day and points to the right are\naveraged over successively longer periods up to 14 days.\nFigure 2. Effect of Number of Requests on Hit Rate Variation.\n \nIf cache performance variation were entirely stochastic, the variance would decrease\nexponentially with increasing sample size [WIL97]. It can be seen from figure 2 that this is only\npartly true - it appears that samples smaller than around 2 million requests are noisy. For larger\nsamples the variance does not decrease strongly with increasing sample size. This indicates that\nthe variation is self-similar over several time scales and is therefore fractal. This is a strong\nindicator that the underlying behaviour is chaotic. This should not be a surprise since the data is\nreally an aggregation of the deterministic choices made by a large number of individuals. Other\nsystems involving aggregation of this kind such as stock markets are already known to be chaotic\n[TAQ86].\nIn fact each cache exhibits unique behavior. The curves labelled Quest1 and Quest2 are derived\nfrom 2 servers that share the load from a single community. Since the load sharing is random,\none would expect the two curves to converge as they do in the graph. However the Quest cache\ndoes not appear to be strongly convergent with NLANR or Korea. The systematic differences\nbetween caches are almost certainly the result of systematic differences between user\ncommunities, and indicate that any model will need to allow for a range of user types with\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500\nRequests ('000)\nNLANR (US)\nE.G.\nHit Rate = 41% (0.41)\nStDev = 0.0088\nStDev \/ Hit Rate = 0.0215\nKorea\nACT (Aus)\nQuest 2\nQuest 1 \nSwinburne (Aus)\nJANET (UK)\ndifferent deterministic properties.\n3.Discussion.\nIt has been shown in this work that a significant proportion of cache performance variation is\nfractal, the self-similar nature of the underlying network traffic [CRO96] supports this. The\ncause is probably the deterministic nature of users and user group behavior. Work to derive a\nmodel for these deterministic effects is currently in progress. It is expected that sophisticated\nmodelling of user group behaviour will be required. In the future, client sets may be defined by\ntheir proportions of users with different usage requirements (Academic, Leisure, Work etc),\nculture (Oriental, Western etc.) and other variables. Their resulting request profiles may be\npredicted, based on these factors, using techniques such as artificial neural nets.\n4.Conclusion.\nHit rate is important when analysing cache performance but there is a significant amount of intra\nand inter-cache variation. Some of the variation is stochastic in origin but much is fractal, i.e.\ndeterministic in origin. Whether this is asymptotically self-similar, self-similar or multi-fractal is\nunclear. Further investigation is required to derive a model for the deterministic effects.\n \n5.References.\n[ABR95] M. Abrams, C.R. Standridge, G. Abdulla, S. Williams and E.A. Fox.
