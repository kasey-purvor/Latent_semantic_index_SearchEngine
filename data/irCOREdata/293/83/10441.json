Cambridge Journal of Economics, Vol. 29, No. 2, March, 2005, pp. 312-313, emphases added.) The precise details of the procedure are often opaque, but the gist of it seems simple enough. First, being unable to know the quantity of socially necessary abstract labour hours embedded in commodities, Cockshott resorts to deducing this number from observable prices.[1] He does so by assuming that the direct number of hours (Marx\u2019s v) is revealed by the dollar wage bill and that the indirect number of hours (Marx\u2019s c) is revealed through iterative imputations of the dollar wage bill incurred in producing the non-labour inputs. And since, in and of themselves, labour values can never be known, this revelation, just like the neoclassical revelation of utility and \u2018factor productivity\u2019, can never be falsified. Second, Cockshott doesn\u2019t correlate average unit price with average unit labour time (as revealed by average unit dollar cost with some transformation). Instead, he correlates total sales with total labour values (as revealed by total dollar cost with some transformation). This move from individual commodities to sectoral aggregates introduces the further hazard of spurious correlation (see the linked Excel file). Taken together, these assumptions enable Cockshott to show that there is a tight correlation between the aggregate dollar sales and the aggregate dollar costs of different sectors. What remains unclear is how these unsurprising price correlations relate to Marx\u2019s labour theory of value \u2013 and, moreover, why Cockshott is convinced that they constitute a scientific proof of that theory. - 14 -- 15 -","cites":null},{"id":18089198,"title":"The Emergence of Probability.

The Rate of Surplus Value in Puerto Rico. Journal of Political Economy 83 (5, October): 935-950. . . .\u2019 A Final Note by Bichler and Nitzan December 1, 2010 In his Open Letter, Cockshott claims that \u2018In science competing theories are supposed to be evaluated on the basis of their ability to explain observed data\u2019 and that \u2018One can propose mechanisms for the labour theory to be confronted with evidence which might refute it\u2019. He further argues that \u2018It is much harder to see how the same might be done with the utility theory of value, whose scientific status is thus questionable\u2019. The critique of the neoclassical utility theory of value is certainly correct. One key reason why this theory cannot be tested is that its elementary particle \u2013 the util \u2013 is unknowable. Neoclassicists bypass this problem \u2013 at least in their own minds \u2013 by going in reverse: they assume that dollar market prices \u2018reveal\u2019 utility and that dollar income flows reveal \u2018factor productivity\u2019. With this revelation, they can then go on to \u2018measure\u2019 (again, in their own minds) the util quantities of the so-called \u2018real economy\u2019 \u2013 from the \u2018real\u2019 flows of production and consumption to the \u2018real\u2019 stocks of assets and capital. Cockshott claims that this isn\u2019t the case with Marx\u2019s labour theory of value. Unlike the neoclassical util, the elementary particle of Marxism \u2013 socially necessary abstract labour time \u2013 can be objectively observed and measured. \u2018It is possible\u2019, he says, \u2018to use input-output tables to work out how many hours of labour went into producing the total output of each industry\u2019. But this claim is false. In fact \u2013 and as Cockshott knows full well \u2013 the only way to \u2018know\u2019 labour values is the neoclassical way: by revelation. Whereas neoclassicists assume that prices reveal utils, Marxists assume that prices reveal socially necessary abstract labour time. And that is it. As they stand, the quantities of utils and labour values exist not as empirical observations, but as religious-like visions. They emerge not from open-ended research and scientific exploration, but from circular rituals that make them true by definition. This is how Cockshott himself describe the process in one of his recent works: Unfortunately . . . we have no such independent data on values. This would require a fully disaggregated input-output table along with data on labour inputs in hours. When we - 13 -compute industry values in practice, our primary data are nothing other than industry costs: we infer values from these costs, with unavoidable error. There are three sources of divergence between the underlying true values and the estimates of values derived using industry cost figures. 1. Values are defined in terms of hours of socially necessary labour time, but in most empirical work direct labour hours are proxied by the wage bill. 2. The assumption that the rate of surplus value is uniform across sectors: most if not all empirical work on value employs this assumption, yet it is not likely to be strictly true. 3. The aggregation issue: each of the sectors or industries used in an empirical study represents the aggregation of a wide range of production processes. The aggregation is, of course, done in terms of monetary values. Thus the weights carried by each sub-sector in the formation of any given sector\u2019s figures depend on market prices, which by assumption exhibit some degree of divergence from values.","cites":null},{"id":18089199,"title":"The Taming of Chance.
