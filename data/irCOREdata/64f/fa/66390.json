We propose\nan alternative method that senses the distortions produced during the outgoing path by forming an intensity\npattern in the atmosphere that is then viewed from the ground.

We also envisage other geometries, all based on the concept of projecting a pupil pattern\nonto the atmosphere. \u00a9 2002 Optical Society of America\nOCIS codes: 010.1080, 120.5060, 140.3600, 350.1260.\nLaser guide stars (LGSs) offer a means of sensing\nthe distortion of an optical beam traveling in the\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere without the need for a bright\nnatural reference source. Conventionally, the laser is\nused to project a bright spot in a scattering medium\nand the backscattered wave front is analyzed with\na conventional wave-front sensor as though it came\nfrom a point source.1 This geometry suffers from a\nnumber of disadvantages, and the technique proposed\nhere seeks to address two of the main ones. The first\nis the so-called cone effect, otherwise known as focus\nanisoplanatism. This effect is due to the different\npropagation paths from the backscattered laser spot\nand the target that is being imaged: In the astro-\nnomical case, the imaged target samples a cylindrical\nvolume of atmospheric turbulence, whereas the beacon\nsamples a cone. This effect leads to inaccuracies in\nthe wave-front measurement that increase as the ratio\nof the telescope diameter to the height of the beacon\nincreases. The second problem is that the intensity of\nthe beam at the focus is high, which leads to problems\nwith local saturation of the resonant layer with sodium\nbeacons and to aircraft and satellite safety hazards\nfor Rayleigh beacons.\nA number of alternatives to conventional LGS\nwave-front sensing have been proposed. Baharav\net al.2,3 proposed the creation of a fringe pattern in the\natmosphere that is analyzed by a Shack\u2013Hartmann\nwave-front sensor. The problem with this proposal is\nthat high laser powers are required, although this was\nrecently amerliorated by the suggested adaptation of\na pyramid wave-front sensor.4 A recent proposal by\nLloyd-Hart et al.5 involved producing a number of im-\nages of different planes in the atmosphere as the laser\npropagates through a focus. These images are then\nused in a phase diversity wave-front sensor. Angel6\nalso proposed a system of dynamically refocusing the\nlaser spot to effectively increase the integration time.\nAll these systems share the common characteristic\nwith the conventional LGS system that the aberrations\nare sensed during the return downward path of the\nlaser.\nHere we propose a different use of a laser to de-\ntermine wave-front distortions. The sensing concept\nhas a number of different possible implementations,\nbut they all share the common principle that the\nwave-front aberrations are sensed by the upward\npassage of the beam. In this Letter we concentrate\non one particular implementation, based on curvature\nsensing, as this has the major advantage of having no\nfocal anisoplanatism. The basic setup is illustrated\nin Fig. 1. A laser beam is expanded to fill the pupil\nof the telescope and propagated as a parallel beam\nupward through the atmosphere. For illustration,\nFig. 1. Schematic diagram of the laser launch system. A\nparallel beam is propagated into the atmosphere and is sub-\nsequently imaged at two heights, h1 and h2, by the camera.\n0146-9592\/02\/030149-03$15.00\/0 \u00a9 2002 Optical Society of America\n150 OPTICS LETTERS \/ Vol. 27, No. 3 \/ February 1, 2002\nwe assume that all the atmospheric turbulence is\nbelow an altitude of h1 \u0002 10 km. The laser emits\npulsed radiation, and when the laser pulse reaches an\naltitude of h1 a snapshot of the Rayleigh backscattered\nradiation is taken with a camera focused at h1, which\nwill show a disk of illumination corresponding to the\ntelescope pupil. When the pulse reaches an altitude\nof h2, 15 km in this case, a second snapshot is taken\nwith a camera focused at h2. From the propagation-\nof-intensity equation, we know that points of the\nlaser wave front at 10-km altitude that are locally\nconverging will result in peaks in the intensity dis-\ntribution at 15 km and locally diverging regions will\ngive rise to local troughs at 15 km. Thus, we can\ninvert the intensity difference between the two images\nwith established methods (e.g., Refs. 7\u20139) to obtain\nthe wave-front distortion in the upward-propagating\nlaser beam (after applying corrections to the detected\nimages to account for the different scattering cross\nsections at the two altitudes and the changes in\napparent images scale). In this configuration, we\nhave effectively built a curvature sensor,10 in which\nthe two images of the telescope pupil are formed in\nthe scattering medium.\nThere are a number of fundamental and practical\nlimitations to this technique: (i) The pupil resolution\nthat is available is limited by the seeing itself. A\nscattering altitude of 15 km and 1-arcsec seeing\ncorrespond to a resolution limit of \u00028 cm, i.e., a maxi-\nmum of 100 3 100 wave-front elements across an 8-m\npupil, which is suff icient for even visible-wavelength\nadaptive optics (when the loop is closed, the number of\nobservable resolution elements will increase). (ii) We\nare most often concerned with knowing the wave-front\ndistortions that correspond to a stellar beam propagat-\ning toward the telescope, whereas the measurands are\nthe distortions of a beam propagating in the opposite\ndirection. In conditions of strong turbulence, this dif-\nference can become important, but for many practical\nsituations the turbulence is sufficiently weak that the\norder in which a collimated beam strikes different\nturbulent layers is unimportant. (iii) This type of\nsystem can clearly work only with a Rayleigh LGS,\nsince multiple-altitude observations are required, al-\nthough other conf igurations, which we describe below,\nare possible with sodium LGSs. (iv) Another factor is\nthe question of the precise location of the observation\nlayers. Atmospheric phase f luctuations should fully\nevolve into intensity variations over a distance r02\u0003l,\nwhere r0 is the Fried parameter and l is the wave-\nlength. In 20-cm seeing at 600 nm, this parameter\nhas the large value of 67 km. Furthermore, a larger\nr0 at higher altitudes will result in underestimating\nthe spacing required between planes. Nevertheless,\nsimulations show that intensity f luctuations do evolve\nto measurable levels over a distance less than r02\u0003l.\n(v) This method is similar to the inverse of a technique\nproposed by Ribak et al.,11 whereby scintillation is\nused as data for a wave-front sensor. One limitation\nof this technique was a lack of boundary conditions,\nand this could also affect the method proposed here.\n(vi) Finally, we assume that the atmosphere acts as\na perfect screen, whereas in reality it will be patchy.\nA full simulation, including noise, and experimental\nmeasurements, which are beyond the scope of this\nLetter, are needed to fully address these questions.\nDespite these limitations, there are many advan-\ntages to using this projected pupil-plane pattern\n(PPPP) configuration compared with a conventional\nfocused-laser-spot approach. The first of these is\nthat focal anisoplanatism can be almost completely\neliminated. A second advantage is that the beam\npower per unit area is much lower than in the fo-\ncused spot, leading to significantly reduced aircraft\nhazard in the case of Rayleigh beacons. For example,\ncompared with a 2-arcsec focused spot at 15 km, an\n8-m-diameter collimated laser beam of the same power\nhas a beam intensity that is a factor of 103 lower.\nIt is possible to make at least as efficient use of\nthe laser radiation for wave-front sensing when one\nis using a PPPP arrangement as when one is using\nconventional focused-laser-spot beacons. Consider,\nfor example, a laser pulse of energy E that is being\nused to determine the wave-front distortions across a\ntelescope of diameter D with an n element wave-front\nsensor. Assuming that the return pulse is time gated\nto allow the radiation scattered between heights\nh 2 Dh\u00032 and h 1 Dh\u00032 in both cases, the returned\nenergy, e, for both the conventional and the PPPP\narrangements is given by\ne \u0004\n1\n16\nE\n\u03bc\nD\nh\n\u22022 t\u0005h\u0006\nL\nDh , (1)\nwhere t\u0005h\u0006 represents the unitless backscattering effi-\nciency for the atmosphere at height h and L is the total\nlength of the pulse. In both cases, we split this energy\nn ways to determine the wave-front deformations over\nn different patches in the pupil, so the energy available\nto measure each degree of freedom in the wave front is\ngiven by\n1\n16\nE\n\u03bc\nD\nh\n\u22022 t\u0005h\u0006Dh\nnL\n. (2)\nThe curvature-sensing arrangement presented above\nis only one possible way of forming a wave-front-\nsensing pattern from an outward-propagating beam.\nAny arrangement that converts wave-front phase\naberrations into intensity variations in the outgoing\nbeam can be used. Figure 2(a) shows an alternative\narrangement based on a point-diffraction interfer-\nometer. In this arrangement the laser beam is split\ninto two parts. One part is expanded to the full\nwidth of the telescope pupil, and the second part is\nprojected as a narrow reference beam of width w. At\nan altitude of z \u0002 w2\u0003l, the narrow beam will begin to\ndiffract with a divergence angle of l\u0003w, and when an\nappropriate value of w is chosen, the collimated and\ndiverging beams will overlap and be approximately\nthe same diameter, forming interference fringes. By\nmodulation of the phase difference between the two\nbeams, the phase of the wave front at any point in the\nprojected pupil can be inferred from the time variation\nFebruary 1, 2002 \/ Vol. 27, No. 3 \/ OPTICS LETTERS 151\nFig. 2. Schematic arrangement to produce a point-diffrac-\ntion interferometric PPPP, using (a) a single reference\nbeam and (b) multiple reference beams. The configura-\ntion shown in (b) has a reduced cone effect compared with\nthe conf iguration in (a).\nof the fringe pattern intensity at that point, by use\nof, for example, four-bucket interferometry techniques\n(although this may be diff icult when one is also trying\nto range gate the laser). The pupil aberrations that\nare thus measured are the difference in the turbulent\naberrations seen by the reference and the main beams.\nAt low altitudes the reference beam is narrow and thus\nis relatively unaffected by turbulence, but turbulence\nat altitudes above which the reference beam begins\nto diverge will suffer an aberration that is correlated\nwith the aberration in the expanded beam. Thus,\nthis arrangement does suffer from a version of the\ncone effect, where the sensitivity to turbulence varies\nroughly linearly with height.\nThe amount of this effective focal anisoplanatism\ncan be reduced by the modif ication shown in Fig. 2(b),\nin which the pupil is effectively split into a number of\nsubpupils, each of which has a reference beam. The\nadvantage afforded by this modification is that w can\nbe increased so that the beam does not begin to diverge\nuntil it reaches some greater altitude. For instance,\nwe can consider a sodium-beacon system in which the\ninterference plane is at h \u0002 90 km and l \u0002 689 nm.\nUsing a single reference beam will require a value of\nw , 8 mm if the reference beam is to overlap the en-\ntire 8-m pupil at an altitude of 90 km. This beam will\nbegin to diverge at an altitude of z \u0004 90 m. Splitting\nthe pupil into 1-m subpupils would allow a value of\nw \u0002 6 cm, and thus the reference beams do not begin to\ndiverge until an altitude of z \u0002 5 km. By modulation\nof adjacent reference beams (care must be taken since\nrange gating is also being performed) at different fre-\nquencies, the phase differences between the reference\nbeams can be deduced at the same time as the differ-\nence between each reference beam and the local region\nof the expanded beam, allowing the wave front across\nthe entire pupil to be accurately determine.\nIn conclusion, we have proposed a new method\nof using laser guide stars to project an intensity\npattern on the atmosphere that is produced on the\nupward-propagating path of the laser through the\natmosphere. This approach has the advantages of re-\nduced laser power densities in the atmosphere and no\nfocal anisoplanatism for certain configurations. We\nare in the process of experimentally verifying such an\napproach.\nG. D. Love\u2019s e-mail address is g.d.love@durham.\nac.uk.\nReferences\n1. See, e.g., N. Ageorges and J. C.
