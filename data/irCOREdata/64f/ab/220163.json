What would it mean to retrieve this criticism in the context of \nwhite anti-racism in the post-apartheid era? Said\u2019s (2003) contrapuntal \nmethod proves useful here as a juxtaposing device whereby the writings \nof a past figure can be critically harnessed, travelling across temporal and \nideological boundaries to interrogate the present. Four interlinked modes \nof disingenuous white anti-racism can thus be identified: 1) a fetishistic \npreoccupation with disproving one\u2019s racism; 2) ostentatious forms of \nantiracism that function as means of self-promotion, as paradoxical means \nof white self-love; 3) the consolidation and extension of agency through \nredemptive gestures of \u2018heroic white antiracism\u2019; 4) \u2018charitable \nantiracism\u2019 which fixes tolerance within a model of charity, as an act of \ngenerosity and that reiterates the status and role of an antiracist \nbenefactor. \n \nKeywords: Biko; Black Consciousness; whiteness; anti-racism; post-\napartheid \n \nThe name of Biko \n \nA name starts to function as a \u2018master-signifier\u2019 when, despite the predominance of a \ngeneral \u2018preferred meaning\u2019 it is put to strategic use by diverse interest groups. This is \nnot necessarily a situation to be avoided: such moments of hegemony indicate that a \nlegacy is alive and well; that a given heritage, no matter how contested, has become a \npart of the popular imaginary of a given culture. Nonetheless, in such instances one is \n 2 \njustified in asking what routinely \u2018falls out\u2019 of the legacy in question, what particular \nelements \u2013 indeed, what discomforting aspects \u2013 are consistently removed by such \nprocesses of hegemonic assimilation.  \nThe name of Biko has become something of a master-signifier in South Africa \ntoday; it is touchstone for many instrumental uses; it acts as an emblem of credibility, \nas a marker of moral, political and cultural capital. This should perhaps come as no \nsurprise. The 12th of September 2007 of course marked the 30th anniversary of Biko\u2019s \ndeath at the hands of apartheid state\u2019s security police. This date was marked by a \nresurgence of interest in Biko\u2019s work and politics (Mngxitama, Alexander & Gibson, \n2008, Van Wyk, 2007). More than an icon of the anti-apartheid liberation struggle and \nof Black Consciousness thought in South Africa, the name of \u2018Biko\u2019 however now \nfunctions as a more encompassing signifier with a properly global range of \nassociations. \u2018Biko\u2019 provides, amongst other things: the inspiration for the \nestablishment of an \u2018Afro Space [radio] Station\u2019; the name of a variety of popular \nsongs (by Bloc Party, Peter Gabriel and others); the name of a Brazilian research \norganization (the Steve Biko Institute, Salvador); the logo and image of a line of \npopular apparel (T-shirts, handbags); even the name of a fictional space-ship in Star \nTrek (the U.S.S. Biko). We have thus a situation akin to what Edward Said (2000) \ndescribes in his account of \u2018travelling theory\u2019: the inevitable dilution of revolutionary \nthought as it is transposed from one strategic context and value-system to another. \nThe above set of examples leads us perhaps to the same conclusion, namely that such \na diverse range of borrowings cannot but lead to a potential neutralization of the name \nin question. Thabo Mbeki\u2019s (2009) comment that many latter-day admirers of Steve \nBiko \u2018seek to redefine him by stripping him of his revolutionary credentials\u2019 (p. 113) \nthus seems justified.  \nTwo possible objections arise in response to the attempt to retrieve Biko. \nFirstly, the gesture of designating the true use of a name is often itself an ideological \noperation, a means of appropriating the name to one\u2019s own particular cause. This \nposes the question, to which I hope to return, of my own agenda in returning to Biko. \nSecondly, there is the contention that although the retrieval of Black Consciousness \nthought is all well and good \u2013 and consonant with calls to prioritize indigenous \nknowledge systems \u2013 it remains a historical task, cut off from more immediate and \npressing social, economic and bio-political agendas of the post-apartheid present. This \nargument gives rise to a challenge: how might we productively retrieve aspects of \n 3 \nBiko\u2019s Black Consciousness thought today, particularly so with a view to exploring \nissues of (anti)-racism today in the post-apartheid context? \n \nContrapuntal reading and de-radicalization \n \nThe revitalization of early critical or literary works is a favoured theme of Edward \nSaid\u2019s. As is well known, Said offers up the notion of the contrapuntal as a way of \nreading pertinent texts from a different era, as a means of disrupting the normative \nassumptions delimiting current conditions of understanding. It helps here to refer \ndirectly to Said\u2019s (2003, p. 25) own account of his contrapuntal retrieval of the work \nof figures that he believes deserve to be read as intrinsically worthwhile still today: \n \nMy approach tries to see them in their context as accurately as possible, but \u2026I see them \n[also] contrapuntally\u2026as figures whose writings travel across temporal, cultural and \nideological boundaries in unforeseen ways\u2026 Thus later history reopens and challenges \nwhat seems to have been the finality of an earlier figure of thought, bringing it into \ncontact with cultural, political and epistemological formations undreamed of by\u2026its \nauthor\u2026 [T]he latencies in a prior figure or form [can]\u2026suddenly illuminate the present. \n \nOur attempt in what follows should thus be to listen with a double-ear, to hear Biko \nnot only obviously in terms of the time, the place and the context in which he wrote, \nbut precisely as if what he wrote was also directed at the post-apartheid and \npostcolonial present.  \nI may not be the best person to attempt such a contrapuntal re-reading of Biko. \nMore than once I have been made aware, by students and colleagues, that my reading \nof Biko is perhaps necessarily skewed, distorted by my background, as if there is an \nepistemological break present in a given white South African\u2019s reading of Biko\u2019s \nessays. There are in fact two pitfalls here. Firstly, the danger of replicating precisely \nwhat Biko warns against, the liberal white subject\u2019s re-representation of black \ncritique, that is, the situation of me speaking for, or over Biko, of using him to my \nown ends. Secondly, and perhaps more insidiously, there is the prospect here of my \nown performative attempt \u2013 in expressing a fidelity to Biko \u2013 to demonstrate, to \nimplicitly prove, my own non-racism. Neither of these are charges that I can fully \nexculpate myself from. As will become apparent as we continue, many of the \ncritiques I go on to develop in this chapter pertain directly both to this chapter itself. \n 4 \nSaid\u2019s ideas on the contrapuntal go beyond the provision of a reading \nmethodology. The contrapuntal is essentially a juxtaposing device whereby one \noverlaps \u2013 for aesthetic or political effect \u2013 two or more incompatible historical, \ntextual, or musical themes. For Said (2003) it is more than just a means of generating \na critical sensibility - it is also a way of apprehending overlapping \u2018territories of \nexperience\u2019, especially so in the case of one who simultaneously occupies two \nradically different cultural worlds. Part of what is useful about this method, this mode \nof experience, is not just that it upsets the present, but also that it draws attention to \nthe domestication of the past and the de-radicalization of certain figures.  \nThis is pertinent in the case of Biko, and in the case of many black resistance \nleaders. For example, a recent Associated Press Report, MLK's Legacy Is More Than \nHis 'Dream' Speech, emphasizes how aspects of King\u2019s less popular political \ncommitments \u2013 his opposition to the Vietnam War, his insistence that poverty and \nmilitarism needed be considered part of the problem of US racism \u2013 have been filtered \nout of public memory. King of course is responsible for some of the most famous \nwords in U.S. history: \u201cI have a dream\u2026\u201d. The third Monday of each January in the \nU.S. is, furthermore, Martin Luther King Day, an extraordinary mark of \ncommemoration. These remembrances of King stand in stark contrast to his declining \npopularity at the time of his death, to the oft-neglected fact of his radicalism in \nattacking the exploitative nature of racialized capitalism. What is my point here? In \nmany instances the institutionalization of such a heroic figure occurs as part of a \nstrategy of amnesia. This is a memorialization which works as a means of forgetting. \nWe have a selective focussing-in on an isolated element which enables a wiping-out \nof a far more disconcerting ensemble of surrounding elements. After all, as Henry \nTaylor (2008) comments in the same report (MLK's Legacy Is More Than His 'Dream' \nSpeech), how many people can recall what followed on in Martin Luther King\u2019s most \nfamous speech, what came after the words \u2018I have a dream\u2019\u2026?  \n \nThe object which proves that it is not so \n \nIn psychoanalysis there is a term which describes this operation \u2013 in which we see a \ngreat investment in a certain object or person taken out of a disturbing context, and \nthat is then memorialized, instituted in a way that enables us to forget, in a manner \nthat protects us from a far more threatening situation. We can treat the \u201cI have a \n 5 \ndream\u201d refrain, much like Martin Luther King Day itself, as a fetish. That is, they are \na way of proving that something is not so. They are a way of proving for white \nAmerica that it is somehow not racist, that a line has been drawn between itself and its \nracist past. This extraction of one given iconic figure, which occurs as a means of \nallowing a far more disconcerting context to be forgotten, is thus an exemplary case \nof how not to retrieve Biko.  \nWe are now well placed to identify one of the modes in which certain forms of \nwhite anti-racism run aground. 1 I have in mind the desperate reiteration of one or two \nexamples from one\u2019s personal history that do the job of ostensibly proving one\u2019s non-\nracism.  We have thus a kind of selective aggrandizement of certain behaviours \noccurring in the face of something far harder, indeed, traumatic, to confront, such as \nthe fact of one\u2019s own complicity in racism. This is a fetishistic form of anti-racism \nwhich relies on some or other heroic and often-revisited object, activity or memory to \ndo the job of proving something not to be the case. This, moreover, is never simply a \nprivate process, but is typically performed before a public of some or other sorts \nprecisely as a means of \u2018making a name\u2019, gaining strategic advantage, of lending  an \nexceptional status to the person in question. Importantly of course, whereas minor \ninstances of resistance against apartheid come to take on a heroic value in the case of \nwhites, similar such infractions and resistances were simply part of the everyday life \nfor black subjects under apartheid. \n A brief example: I recently received a proposal for a PhD focussing on \u2018the \nrole of a new generation of students in the post-apartheid era in re-shaping the social \ndynamics of South Africa\u2019. Now to be fair, it is not absolutely clear that the students \nin question are meant to be white students, so we should not leap in to criticize too \nquickly. Those familiar with Biko\u2019s critique of white liberalism will however \nimmediately grasp what is potentially problematic here. This example illustrates two \ntactics of white anti-racism which typically go together: firstly, an attempted \ndemonstration of non-complicity; secondly, an instance of the re-centering of \nwhiteness. It is useful here to refer directly to Biko, who suggests that such gestures \nshow up the real underlying motivation of this sort of anti-racism: the attempt to \nportray an image of one\u2019s self as non-racist. White liberals, he says (1978, p. 23)  \n \n \n 6 \nwaste lots of time in an internal sort of mudslinging designed to prove that A is more of a \nliberal than B\u2026[They]\u2026try to prove to as many blacks as they can find that they are \nliberal. \n \nAnticipating \u2018critical whiteness studies\u2019 \n \nIt is this problem, the \u2018re-centring of whiteness\u2019 as it appears even in the critique of \nracism, that I want to focus on as we continue. It provides an answer to the question \nof how we might retrieve Biko today, that is, by returning to an element of his work \noften neglected: his critique of whiteness, what he terms \u2018white liberal ideology\u2019, or \nmore directly yet, his attacks on certain forms of white anti-racism. My contention is \nthat Biko\u2019s critique of whiteness anticipates, and in some senses improves upon, many \nof the central arguments that would emerge in the later domain of \u2018critical whiteness \nstudies\u2019. \n A useful contemporary backdrop to our retrieval of Biko comes in the form of \nSara Ahmed\u2019s (2004) seminal paper Declarations of Whiteness. Her article provides a \nvaluable means of orientation: it both introduces key moments in the history of \nwhiteness studies and draws out many of the limitations of this area of scholarship. In \nresponse to the question of \u2018why study whiteness?\u2019, Ahmed (2004) offers the reply \nthat it is a crucial component of anti-racism; it can make apparent insidious forms of \nwhite hegemony and emphasize aspects of white racism and privilege not otherwise \nbrought into critical visibility. Of the multiple possible genealogies of whiteness \nstudies we should, for Ahmed, opt for one which treats the work of black feminists as \nits starting-point, prioritizing thus the black critique of whiteness. Although in \nprinciple I agree, I would like to extend her proposed timeline, to try and demonstrate \nhow Biko\u2019s critique of whiteness contains in germinal form many of the arguments \nthat would be explored by a later generation of authors. \nAhmed (2004) opposes the black critique of whiteness to the more recent and \nfashionable studies by white academics (Frankenberg, 1993, Dyer, 1997) who like to \nemphasize how whiteness operates as invisible, as an implicit cultural norm or \nframing position. She is aware of how the study of whiteness may ultimately end up \nlending support to that which it had hoped to critique. The dangers here are easy \nenough to anticipate: one might end up \u2018substantializing\u2019 whiteness, re-centring it as a \nfixed category of experience, thus reifying it, lending it an essence (Fine, Powell, \n 7 \nWeis & Wong, 1997), treating it, as Garner (1997) cautions, not so much as a set of \nsocial relationships but as on object in itself. \n What this means is that the project of showing up the ostensible invisibility of \nwhiteness will not be enough, just as the attempt on the part of white academics to try \nand \u2018step outside of whiteness\u2019 cannot, in and of itself, be adequate. After all, as \nAhmed (2004) repeatedly emphasizes, whiteness is only invisible to those who inhabit \nit; the very act of turning a critical gaze upon the whiteness can operate to place it \nonce again centre-stage. As such something more unsettling, more genuinely \ndestabilizing is required in the analysis of whiteness. \n \nWhite terror \n \nThere are aspects of Biko\u2019s writings which do target the normalizing factor of \nwhiteness, attacking its role as a cultural bench-mark from which judgements of \ndeviance, beauty and morality can be made. Black consciousness he says, seeks to \nundo the lie that \u2018black is an aberration from the \u201cnormal\u201d which is white\u2019 (1978, p. \n100). This entails an awareness of how radically divergent material living conditions \ncome to take on a psychological and moral value; coming thus to provide the basis for \nintuitive attributions of inferiority and superiority: \n \n\u2026the Black man in himself has developed a certain state of alienation. He\u2026attaches the \nmeaning White to all that is good\u2026 [This situation] arises out of living\u2026it is part of the \nroots of self-negation which our kids get even as they grow up. The homes are different, \nthe streets\u2026so you tend to begin to feel that there is something incomplete in your \nhumanity, and that completeness goes with whiteness. (pp. 100-101) \n \nClearly these are not comments which risk reifying whiteness, or white experience; \nthey maintain no redemptive end-point, no hope of tacitly reconsolidating white \nagency. We see in fact in Biko qualities of the trope of whiteness as terror which \nwould prove so important for African-American authors such as bell hooks and Toni \nMorrison for whom the history of slavery and white supremacy is not easily forgotten. \nWhiteness is accordingly thus assigned the values of brutality, inhumanity and \ncapricious violence: \n \n 8 \nThere is such an obvious aura of immorality and naked cruelty in all that is done in the \nname of white people\u2026 in South Africa whiteness has always been associated with \npolice brutality and intimidation\u2026[with] general harassment\u2026 The claim by whites of a \nmonopoly on comfort and security has always been so exclusive that blacks see whites as \nthe major obstacle in their progress towards peace, prosperity and a sane society. \nThrough its association with all these negative aspects, whiteness has thus been soiled \nbeyond recognition. At best\u2026blacks see whiteness as a concept that warrants being \ndespised, hated, destroyed and replaced by an aspiration with more human content in it. \n(1978, p. 77) \n \nThese are comments that a liberal white sensibility would prefer to forget; it is for this \nvery reason important to dwell upon them. Biko\u2019s thoughts introduce a discordant \nnote into post-apartheid platitudes of the rainbow nation; they disturb the ideals of a \nliberal multicultural model of integration that systematically favours some over \nothers.  \nIt is important to emphasize the contrapuntal reading method we have embarked \non, so as to avoid the relief which, for some, may come from being able to claim some \nhistorical and geographical distance from what Biko is describing. A defensive \nresponse to Biko\u2019s arguments would seek to qualify this whiteness as apartheid \nwhiteness, the inhumanity in question as essentially that of the oppressions of the \napartheid state. The problem here is that Biko (1978, p. 76) is speaking not only of the \nphysical oppression of explicit forms of violence, but also of the structural \noppressions resulting from capitalist modes of dominance that have historically \nallowed whites to maintain \u2018a monopoly on comfort and security\u2019. His words thus \nclearly have relevance beyond the realm of state-sponsored racist violence, beyond \nthe historical era of apartheid.  \nPerhaps the most predictable retort to Biko would be to argue that \u2018whiteness\u2019 \nitself is not a viable category of analysis because it is unwieldy, lacking in \ndifferentiation. This is something Biko anticipates; defensive recourse to the \nostensibly heterogeneous nature of white society is, for him, part of the problem. \u2018It \nmay perhaps surprise some people\u2019, he writes \u2018that I should talk of whites in a \ncollective sense\u2019, nonetheless  \n \n[b]asically the South African white community is a homogeneous community. It is a \ncommunity of people who sit to enjoy a privileged position that they do not deserve, are \n 9 \naware of this, and therefore spend their time trying to justify why they are doing so. \n(1978, p. 19) \n \nRead within the context of his time, or of ours, Biko\u2019s arguments offers whites no \ndistance from whiteness, no possibility of dis-identification. One might contend that \nthere is a necessary wounding of the narcissism of whiteness at work here. He (1978, \np. 66) insists that  \n \n[Whites] are born into privilege and are nourished and nurtured in the system of ruthless \nexploitation of black energy\u2026 No matter how genuine a liberal\u2019s motivations may be, he \nhas to accept that, though he did not choose to [it he was]\u2026born into privilege.  \n \nOr, as he puts it elsewhere: \u2018in the ultimate analysis no white person can escape being \npart of the oppressor camp\u2019 (1978, p. 23).  \n \nRacial capitalism and non-integration \n \nWhile Biko\u2019s critique of white racism is clearly focussed on the South African \ncontext, it also has, as intimated above, a global resonance. Apartheid represents a \nparticularly brutal instantiation of a racist power structure that can be felt elsewhere in \nthe world:  \n \n[T]he black-white power struggle in South Africa is but a microcosm of the global \nconfrontation between the Third World and the rich white nations of the world which is \nmanifesting itself in an ever more real manner as the years go by. (Biko, 1978, p. 72) \n \nThe South Africa of Biko\u2019s time is thus not so easily separated from the international \nrealm; apartheid indexes a worldwide struggle against power of rich white nations. \nFurthermore, this white power structure is typically under-written by capitalism itself: \n\u2018the colour question in South African politics\u2019 says Biko (1978, pp. 96-97) \u2018was \noriginally introduced for economic reasons\u2019: \n \nThe leaders of the white community had to create some kind of barrier between the \nblacks and whites so that the whites could enjoy privileges at the expense of blacks and \nstill feel free to give a moral justification for th[is]\u2026obvious exploitation. \n 10 \n \nWhile it is true that a class-based analysis took some time to emerge in the Black \nConsciousness movement, anti-capitalist critique did become an increasingly \nimportant topic in Black Consciousness circles from the mid 1970\u2019s on. There is a \nconcomitant shift in language; it is no longer simply the \u2018white power structure\u2019 that \nis targeted but, as Badat (2009, p. 63) notes, the \u2018white capitalist regime\u2019 and \u2018racial \ncapitalism\u2019.  \nHere it is important to reiterate again that Biko\u2019s critique is of white liberals \nand that, as Budlender (1991) helpfully reiterates, liberalism is the philosophical \nunderpinning of capitalism. In his prioritization of what will need to be addressed in a \npost-revolutionary South African society, Biko (1971, p. 2) thus speaks together of \ncapitalism and \u2018the whole gamut of white value systems\u2019. Or, as Biko\u2019s colleague \nDiliza Mji put it: \u2018Apartheid as an exploitative system is part of a bigger whole, \ncapitalism\u2019 (cited in Badat, 2009, p. 63). It is for this reason that Mngxitama (2008) \nremarks that whereas anti-racialism produces gestures of integration and de-\ncategorization \u2013 tending to accommodation within existing societal and economic \nstructures - true \u2018anti-racism seeks to end the world as we know it\u2019 (p. 10).  \n \nNarcissistic anti-racism\/white heroism \n \nThe apparently radical nature of the whiteness-as-terror, autonomy-of-whiteness and \n\u2018white capital\u2019 themes is thus crucial; it prevents the heroic re-centring of whiteness \nprevalent in many of the more ostentatious forms of white anti-racism. Here one \nmight cite the case of how Biko was taken up within the realm of British popular \nculture, questioning how he became something of a white preoccupation. Moving \naway briefly from the South African context, we may attempt here to engage an \naspect of Biko\u2019s critique of whiteness precisely against the prospect of certain white \nappropriations of Biko.  \nIn the 1980\u2019s both Peter Gabriel and Simple Minds recorded versions of \n\u2018Biko\u2019, the anti-apartheid song Gabriel had written about Biko\u2019s death. Gabriel \nperformed the song, at Live Aid before an audience of 25 million people. Despite the \nobvious political potential of such an act, it is difficult not to feel a slight sense of \nunease in watching this footage today, in an era where such political anthems are less \nin vogue. It seems harder now to deny that such a performance holds Gabriel himself \n 11 \nup to the limelight, securing for the singer and his audience a kind of anti-racist social \ncapital. One might adopt a psychoanalytic perspective here, by asking whether such a \ngesture, no matter how well-intentioned \u2013 and which certainly can be read as a \nlaudable form of consciousness-raising \u2013 does not risk tipping over into an instance of \n\u2018anti-racist narcissism\u2019. We should not be blind to this possibility: that at the very \nmoment in which one is fully immersed in publicly applauding the sacrifice, the \nheroism of an other one is simultaneously reaping the rewards of the attention thus \ncalled onto one\u2019s self. Although he directs his comments at white South Africa, \nChabani Manganyi\u2019s (1973, p. 17) words nonetheless seem pertinent here: \u2018liberalism \ncan only be a form of narcissism \u2013 a form of white self-love\u2019.  \nImportant here also is Richard Attenborough\u2019s (1987) Cry Freedom. Although \nthe film is ostensibly about Biko, or the relationship between Steve Biko and the \nliberal journalist Donald Woods, it ultimately becomes a story of white heroism. The \nsecond half of the film is devoted to Woods\u2019 escape from South Africa, and the role \nhe plays in alerting the world to the conditions under which Steve died.  The same \ncan\u2019t be said about Attenborough\u2019s earlier (1982) film Gandhi. There the point is \nmade very didactically that a break must be enforced, that Gandhi must part with one \nof his most trusted English comrades if the anti-colonial struggle was to be brought \nabout by Indians themselves. A comparison of these films is revealing. A narrative \ncentred on the life of a heroic Indian man and his political struggle is enough to \nsustain Gandhi, to make it both dramatically and commercially viable. The same \napproach does not suffice in Cry Freedom, where the struggle against apartheid must \nbe told in the terms of a black-and-white relationship; a white hero, a white \nperspective, must play its part. This is a trope with which we are by now familiar \nwith, from John Briley\u2019s (1987) novelistic treatment of the Biko-Woods relationship, \nappropriately sub-titled The story of a friendship, to James Gregory\u2019s account of his \ntime as Mandela\u2019s jailer: Goodbye bafana: Nelson Mandela, my prisoner, my friend. \nReturning though to Cry Freedom: the film\u2019s screenplay is heavily reliant on Woods\u2019s \n(1987) Biko; we have thus a kind of Woods-ification of Biko, another contribution to \nthe longstanding tradition of whites who make a career out of their involvement in the \nstruggle, out of their very anti-racism, their critique of whiteness.  \nThis is a critique which, quite obviously, I am not immune to. What emerges \nhere is the difficult issue of complicity in what one critiques, the prospect, in other \nwords, of one\u2019s investment in precisely what one attempts to distance one\u2019s self from. \n 12 \nReturning though to the theme of white anti-racist agency: although Biko does not \nexplore the topic of white anti-racist heroism in any great detail, he (1978, p. 66) most \ncertainly is scornful of the white insistence on maintaining agency and prescribing \nroles for blacks within the anti-apartheid struggle: \n \nNot only have the whites been guilty of being on the offensive, but, by some skilful \nmanoeuvres, they have managed to control the response of blacks\u2026 Not only have they \nkicked the black but they have also told him how to react to the kick. \n \nHe is (1978, p. 20) likewise dismissive of the idea of a shared struggle:  \n \nNowhere is the arrogance of\u2026liberal ideology demonstrated so well as in their insistence \nthat the problems of the country be solved by a bilateral approach involving both black \nand white. \n \nWe have already identified one mode of a disingenuous white anti-racism: the tactic \nof fetishism whereby one \u2018disproves\u2019 one\u2019s racism on the basis of a certain act or \nobject. To this tactic we can add two more. Firstly, ostentatious forms of anti-racism \nwhich function as forms of self-promotion, as paradoxical means of extending white \nnarcissism. Secondly, types of anti-racism which enable a re-centring of whiteness, \naiming to consolidate and extend white agency, typically \u2013 although not exclusively - \nthrough acts of white heroism or self-sacrifice.  \n \nWhite declarations \n \nWe are now in a position to introduce Ahmed\u2019s most important argument in her \ncritique of whiteness and whiteness studies. Ahmed is interested in admissions of \nracism, whether they take place in the context of institutional declarations of bad \npractice, or in certain styles of confession or apology, in which past historical \ninjustices must be spoken out as a precondition of salvaging a particular identity. We \nare witnessing today, as she puts it, a shift towards a \u2018politics of declaration\u2019 which \nfor many suffices as an adequate gesture of anti-racism.  \nSuch declarations, for Ahmed (2004, p. 1), involve a fantasy of transcendence \n\u2018in which \u2018what\u2019 is transcended is the very \u2018thing\u2019 admitted in the declaration\u2019. In \nbasic terms: I admit to my racism so as to exculpate myself from my racism, to prove \n 13 \nthat I am essentially a well-intentioned non-racist because, after all, proper racists do \nnot know that they are racists. Something is thus performed - a confession, an \napology, an admission - but it is not fully translated into an action, it remains stuck at \nthe level of speech-act, this is what Ahmed has in mind with the notion of he non-\nperformativity of anti-racism. I disagree with her here inasmuch as within the strict \nterms of speech-act theory something is performed here, precisely the performance of \nan avowal, a declaration, an apology \u2013 which itself may indeed have some limited \nvalue \u2013 although, and here I certainly do agree with her, it remains in and of itself \nwholly inadequate. \n I was recently introduced to a convention of vital importance to many \nAustralian scholars when discussing aboriginal rights, particularly so in public \nsettings. The convention in question is a declarative act, the acknowledgement of \naboriginal sovereignty in relation to Australian land. Now, as in the case of any \nspeech-act, much depends on the contingencies of who is making the statement; how \nit is said; what it is done by saying it (that is, its illocutionary force, its function as a \nspeech-act); who it is received by and how; and what set of effects its gives rise to. \n2Bearing all of this in mind, and considering also that this is a convention that both \naboriginal and non-aboriginal Australians adhere to, one may appreciate that this can \nbe a meaningful and politically important declaration. Then again, there is also the \npossibility that such a speech-act may be read as \u2013 however well-intentioned \u2013 an \nexemplary example of a saying but a not doing. In many instances such a concession \nis one by which the declarative subject (say the upwardly mobile, non-aboriginal \nland-owner) never really stands to lose \u2013 the land is not presumably going to be given \nback \u2013 although they do stand to gain something, namely the status of a politically-\nsensitive, penitent subject. All too often \u2013 or so it would seem - there is something \nincomplete about such measures, certainly given that they typically fit perfectly with \nexisting structures of benefit. One acknowledges the social asymmetries that one has \nbenefited from (assuming of course that one is a beneficiary), thus alleviating a \nportion of guilt, whilst continuing to enjoy these privileges indeed, consolidating them \nat a higher level by virtue of one\u2019s awareness, one\u2019s self-reflexive stance. \n This is the type of critique Ahmed directs at whiteness studies itself, the idea, \nsimply put, that by saying I am white, I am somehow not white, or less white because \nof it, the end result of which is that I achieve some distance from whiteness. There are \ninteresting parallels to be found in Biko; he points to how white liberals attempt to \n 14 \ndistinguish themselves from whiteness, to create a pretend difference, a pseudo-\ndistinction. We have here a similar structure: an appeal to criticality, to an imaginary \noutside position, which allows this subject to win on two fronts. Here it is once again \nworth quoting Biko (1978, pp. 20-22) at length: \n \n[White] liberals, leftists\u2026are the people who argue that they are not responsible for \nwhite racism\u2026these are the people who say that they have black souls wrapped up in \nwhite skins\u2026 They want to remain in the good books with both the black and the white \nworlds\u2026 They vacillate between the two worlds, verbalizing all the complaints of the \nblacks beautifully while skilfully extracting what suits them from the exclusive pool of \nwhite privileges\u2026 [The white liberal] claims complete identification with the blacks\u2026 \n[H]e moves around\u2026white circles\u2026with a lighter load, feeling that he is not like the rest \nof the others. Yet at the back of his mind is a constant reminder that he is quite \ncomfortable as things stand. \n \nCharitable anti-racism \n \nIf we read Biko and Ahmed together we might suggest that today\u2019s version of \u2018I am a \nprogressive liberal, I am against apartheid\u2019 is \u2018I admit how the systematic oppressions \nof apartheid racism benefited me, I am aware of my own latent racism, but I am going \nto give something back\u2019. Let me offer a fictional vignette. A white South African \ncolleague returns from abroad after attaining considerable success in his chosen career \nas entrepreneur. His objective is to re-locate to South Africa, to purchase a large area \nof land in a beautiful part of the country, and to fund this by resuming links - long \nsince established by his family - to an industry, let us say mining that has been \nfounded on long-standing structures of apartheid exploitation. How might such an \nagenda be made viable, especially given the evident contradiction here between the \nperpetuation of historical patterns of racialized privilege, and post-apartheid goals of \ntransformation and re-distribution? \nThe colleague in question might begin by declaring openly that he has profited \nin multiple ways from an inequitable system but that he now wishes to make amends, \nto contribute in a meaningful way to the country, to participate in processes of \nreconciliation and structural change. This would mean that his involvement in the \naforementioned industry would need include a charitable dimension and, furthermore, \nan instance of symbolic redress. A limited profit-sharing scheme in which previously \n 15 \ndisenfranchised workers become part stakeholders would be one prospect here, as \nwould the setting up of a trust fund of sorts, a scholarship programme, or an anti-\nracism research programme of significance to the organization itself. Such initiatives \ncould then, potentially, be converted into social capital; reported upon, disseminated \nin a way that publicizes this \u2018proof of change\u2019 as widely as possible. Historical \nprivileges of whiteness are thus consolidated; business can go on as usual with the \nadded gained of an improved moral standing. The benefits of whiteness can thus be \nconverted into the currency of anti-racism. \nThis seems a poor basis for transformation, for types of historical redress and \nanti-racism, certainly so inasmuch as they are premised on the promotion of forms of \nwhite narcissism. What I am referring to as \u2018charitable\u2019 instances of anti-racism do \nnot result in a levelling of the playing field, in a necessary increase in the equality of \nsociety, but instead in the affirmation of a different order of privilege. They involve a \ntrade-off: the declaration of a past racism \u2013 or admission of racialized privilege - is \noffered on condition that the speaker, the agent of the declaration, is able to claim the \nposition of the redeemed subject, or gain something by way of liberal social capital. \nIt would be false of me to try and distance myself from the \u2018giving something \nback\u2019 discourse. It makes for one of the dominant modes of a repentant whiteness \ntoday, one of the more habitable means of occupying a position of racialized \nprivilege. Moreover, I think it is important to signal again the contingency that \nunderlies the declarative gestures that Ahmed focuses on. There is as such the \npossibility that such declarations or gestures can be genuine \u2013 indeed can be accepted \nin good faith - that they need not always slip back into patterns of pre-existing \nstructural privilege. There is not a kind of unconscious hypocrisy behind every \napology or mode of redress. As Ahmed puts it, \u2018The desire for action, or even the \ndesire to be seen as the good white anti-racist subject, is not always a form of bad \nfaith\u2026it does not necessarily involve the concealment of racism\u2019 (p. 57). There is \nhowever, a remaining problem, the fact such forms of anti-racism often come to be \nfixed in the mode of charity. \n  \nDoing good\/Humanitarian violence \n \nI have long been intrigued by Winnicott\u2019s (1949) warning to psychoanalysts that \ngranting extra time to their patients is an unconscious expression of hatred. The idea \n 16 \nof course being that an aggressive impulse is defended against by means of \nconversion into its opposite. A similar warning can be drawn from Lacan\u2019s (1992) \nEthics of Psychoanalysis, his injunction there being that one should maintain a \npronounced distrust of the motivation to do good, to be charitable. Why so? Well, we \nmight answer, there is a reiteration of status that follows on from being in a position \nto give; a tremendous symbolic value accords such a position; furthermore, numerous \nego-gains follow on from the other\u2019s recognition of my goodness. \nReiterating the role of a benefactor entrenches a subservient position of those \nwhom good needs to be done to. The act of charity can be said to create a subject and \nan object, the giver and the \u2018object group\u2019 to whom the giving occurs. We have thus \nthe generation of a set of reliant and needy subjects, whose status as disempowered is \naffirmed in what we might refer to as \u2018the violence of charity\u2019. What we see replicated \nthen is a subject-other dynamic not dissimilar to that of racism itself. As in colonial \nracism we have one category of subject who acts, who changes history as an agent, \nand another, to whom things are done, and whom does not acquire the status of an \nable historical agent. As Biko (1978, p. 23) would remind us, we are not far here from \nthe assumption that they are the problem: \n \n[Liberals have] the false belief that they are faced with A black problem. There is \nnothing wrong with blacks. The problem is WHITE RACISM and it rests squarely on the \nlaps of white society. \n \nI remember some years ago a report in the British media in which an African country \nstruck by famine rejected a donation of clothes from a charitable organization, \ncomplaining that not enough brand labels were included. Rather than succumbing to \nthe response that the report was clearly designed to trigger \u2013 the angry dismissal of \nthese beneficiaries as ingrates - one should see this as a properly ethical gesture. It \nwas ethical in a precise sense, in that it brought out the latent aggression contained \nwithin the charitable act of giving. Put differently, it showed up the relation of gain \nunderlying the symbolic pact of charity. This is an object-lesson in how quickly \ncharity flips over into aggression, particularly so when what is implicitly requested in \nthe act of charity - the recognition of the status, the benevolence of the benefactor - is \ndenied. After all, if one is not narcissistically invested in one\u2019s own image as \nbenefactor, then what is so offensive about the refusal of the gift? \n 17 \n What proves difficult for white subjects of privilege is not so much the \ninjunction to admit one\u2019s privilege, or even to confront one\u2019s own latent racism, but to \nforego both the narcissistic gains in doing so, the symbolic rewards of being \nrecognized to have done so. To do the work of anti-racism \u2013 and indeed the \nacknowledgement of racism - without the lures of these two kinds of benefit is to \nrealize that it is not the task, the prerogative of the privileged to give something to the \nother. It is to realize that there is a certain work of equality and redress, but that it \ndoesn\u2019t fall to me to benefit from it, that it is not my prerogative to be the giver, the \nagent of help, of a charitable giving. \nIt helps us to be aware of the rewards that accrue to the subject who declares \ntheir whiteness, their (past) racism, their position of racialized privilege.  Such \nbenefits - the rewards of narcissistic gain, of recognition, of symbolic capital \u2013 make \nit clear that many instances of anti-racism are more self-serving than they may at first \nappear. Pertinent as these remarks are, do they not set the bar too high in respect of a \nprospective \u2018ethics\u2019 of anti-racism? To dissolve the dimensions of narcissism and \nrecognition would surely be to dissipate much of the motivation of anti-racism? I \nhope that the falsity of such an argument is by now totally apparent. Anti-racism \ncannot be based on a model of charity; tolerance is not something which can be given. \nThis is another point anticipated by Biko: anti-racism cannot be a gift, an act of \ngenerosity. If it were then there would be a systematic privileging of certain subjects. \nAfter all, only certain subjects are in the position of being able to covert their racism \ninto the currency of anti-racism, to reap thus the redemptive benefits of charitable \nanti-racism. A meaningful anti-racism is not one which remains preoccupied with \nvalidating, redeeming, or consolidating of the identity the anti-racist subject. It is not \nthe project of ameliorating guilt.  \n There is thus good reason to call to a halt gestures of white redemption, to pre-\nempt and disenable such enactments of penitence, particularly so if they function to \nre-instantiate images of white exceptionality. This argument is nowhere better stated \nthan in Mngxitama\u2019s (2009) response to the question of what should be required from \nwhites in response to apartheid\u2019s ongoing legacy of racism. Mngxitama (2009, p. 25) \ncomments that \u201cfor myself, as a black person, I don\u2019t want: \n \n1. Acknowledgement of whites\u2019 culpability \n2. Disclosure and remorse for what happened during colonialism and apartheid \n 18 \n3. I wish for no dialogue \n4. Whites owe me no apology or washing of feet \n5. Please, not another conference on racism \n6. No pledges confirming our collective humanity \n \nGuilt superiority \n  \nBefore closing, let me respond to a foreseeable criticism. The argument can be made \nthat I exemplify each of the critiques I have put forward, that, despite myself, I \nrepeatedly enact the failure of my own position. On the one hand there is the charge \nthat I fall prey to the tactics of an attempted \u2018ex-nomination\u2019 of myself from racism \nand whiteness alike, that I simply repeat at a higher level what I critique, and do so \nvia a false separation of myself from various other \u2018declarations of whiteness\u2019. This of \ncourse returns us to the issue raised at the beginning, namely of my own tacit agenda \nin attempting to \u2018retrieve Biko\u2019. Aligned to this there is a sense that a narcissistic self-\nconcern still predominates here, and that it is this \u2013 a form of white guilt - that \nultimately provides the compass of the critique in question.   \nA self-redeeming defence is not what is called for here. True enough, such \narguments as advanced by me (regards declarations of whiteness, the ex-nomination \nof one\u2019s self from racism) perhaps do necessarily fail. This, however, does not \nnecessarily mean that the critical agenda of this paper as a whole runs aground if it \nsucceeds in showing how declarative instances of apparent anti-racism do not always \ntranscend the trappings of narcissistic and symbolic gain. Odd as a conclusion as this \nmight seem, the demonstration of such failings, the very fact of their recognition, may \nitself prove an important halfway point in an ongoing project of critique.  \nFurthermore \u2013 here yet another variation on the overlap of demonstrated self-\ncritique, narcissism and attempted exculpation \u2013 one should remain alive to what is \ntypically enabled even through such admissions of failure. There is a type of \ngrandiose self-absorption exemplified even in the project of pointing out one\u2019s racist \nfailings, a type of \u2018heroism of vilification\u2019. As Bruckner (2006) comments, such \n\u2018noisy stigmatizations only serve to mask the wounded self-love\u2019 (p. 49). We should \nas such be deeply suspicious of politically-correct self-flagellation of this type; for \nBruckner it provides simply an inverted means of clinging to one\u2019s superiority. \nRacism is by no means bypassed in this way; it is rather re-inscribed at a different \n 19 \nlevel. The extent of white guilt, the enlarged moral responsibility assumed in relation \nto patterns of racialized privilege, these reiterate once again the importance of white \nliberal subjectivity which grows in proportion to the amount of culpability it assumes. \n\u2018The positive form of the White Man\u2019s Burden (his responsibility for civilizing the \ncolonized\u2026) is thus merely replaced by its negative form (the burden of the white \nman\u2019s guilt)\u2019 (\u017di\u017eek, 2009, p. 114). White guilt that is to say, remains a suspect; if \nlinked to politics it remains more often than not a guilt politics aimed at relieving the \nsubject\u2019s own discomfort, a political narcissism. \n \nContrapuntal openings \n \nIn what has gone above I made reference above to what might be the wounding of \nwhiteness. I also mentioned that the contrapuntal is a means of overlapping different \nterritories of experience, a potentially unsettling or destabilizing \u2018opening up\u2019. How, \nby way of conclusion, might we link these two ideas? \nEdward Said offers a curious model of cosmopolitan subjectivity. In \napproaching this topic, he considers a far broader realm of cultural insularity than that \nof the white racism and anti-racism we have focussed on. Said is concerned with the \ndiscomfort of a continually decentred subject, with the fact that  \n \n\u2026for even for the most identifiable, the most stubborn communal identity\u2026there are \ninherent limits that prevent it from being fully incorporated into one, and only one \nIdentity. (2003, pp. 53-54) \n \nFor Said there is ultimately no self-enclosed wholeness of the subject, no security of \nan identity at one with itself. Such forms of anxious decentring in some way \npotentially affect us all, and Said takes them to underlie the generation of a spectrum \nof intolerances and chauvinisms. What thus becomes apparent is that one way of \nunderstanding the contrapuntal is as a wound, a puncturing of the narcissistic \nenclosure of self-contained identity.  \nSaid\u2019s description of the difficulties, the pains of cosmopolitanism is \nconsonant with this idea. The cosmopolitan for him is not to be understood in the \nterms of sentimental humanism, a beneficent multiculturalism or universal \nbrotherliness. By contrast, it is seen as something far more troubling and \n 20 \ndiscomforting, something which holds neither the promise of singularity, nor of any \n\u201cfeeling better\u201d. Cosmopolitanism is a lack of closure, a lack of a closure of identity, a \nlack of a closure of cultural insularity. Like a wound that does not heal, cosmopolitan \nsubjectivity is a kind of painful remaining open, a refusal to close into one. One might \nlink this notion of cosmopolitan subjectivity to psychoanalytic conceptualizations \nsuch as Klein\u2019s depressive position or Lacan\u2019s \u2018subjective destitution\u2019, both of which \nforeclose the possibility of narcissistic wholeness and eschew fantasies of \ntranscendence or exceptionalism in favour of something far more fragmented and \ndisconcerting. This then is the essence of the cosmopolitan for Said (2003, p. 54), a \nmode of subjectivity which is made possible not through \u2018dispensing palliatives such \nas tolerance and compassion\u2019 but by its existence as \u2018a troubling, disabling, \ndestabilizing\u2026wound\u2019, from which \u2018there can be no recovery\u2026no utopian \nreconciliation even within itself\u2019. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n1 Given that I am writing of the post-apartheid context I mean \u2018anti-racism\u2019 in a very broad sense, that \nis, as inclusive of a variety of attempts at integration, redistribution, historical redress, \u2018affirmative \naction\u2019 and so on. \n \n2 See Gobodo-Madikizela (2003) for an excellent account of the ethical quandaries underlying political \napologies in the context of reconciliation. \n \n \nReferences \nAhmed, S. 2004.
