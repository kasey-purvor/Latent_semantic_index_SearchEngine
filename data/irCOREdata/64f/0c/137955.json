Traditionally, \na treatise of this type should start with a dictionary definition, for example: \n\u2018Efficiency n. The quality or degree of being efficient\u2019 \n\u2018Efficient a. \u2026productive of desired effects; especially: productive without waste.\u2019  \n(Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary). \n \nIn the context of civil aviation \u2018efficiency\u2019 is most often, either directly or \nindirectly, related to cost; \u2018waste\u2019 refers to a waste of time or money.  However, for \nthe sake of \u2018efficiency\u2019 the conclusions to this treatise can be stated up front.   Good \nHuman Factors will not significantly increase efficiency by itself.  On its own, only \nsmall incremental gains may be made.  A wider, sociotechnical perspective needs to \nbe adopted before any true efficiency gains incorporating good Human Factors can be \nrealised.  \n \nIn the aerospace industry \u2018Human Factors\u2019 has become synonymous with Crew \nResource Management and ergonomics.  However, there is much more to the \ndiscipline than this.  All boundaries and divisions created by man are artificial, and \nsubject matter boundaries in the complex world of aviation operations are both \nartificial and arbitrary.  However, when addressing a topic such as the role of Human \nFactors in operational efficiency some structure is essential.  As a result this discourse \nis organised around a sociotechnical systems framework to impose some structure on \nthe chaos.  This structure also reflects the organisation and operation of an airline and \nclarifies the influences that effect the manner in which it operates. The framework \n 4\nused is the five \u2018M\u2019s model (Harris & Smith, 1997; Harris & Harris, 2004; Harris & \nThomas, 2005).  \n \n \nTHE FIVE \u2018M\u2019S MODEL OF SOCIOTECHNICAL SYSTEMS \n \nThe operation of an airliner is not just about the integration of pilot (huMan) and \naircraft (Machine) to perform a flight (or Mission) within the constraints imposed by \nthe physical environment (Medium).  This approach needs extending to encompass the \nsocietal environment, an additional aspect of the Medium.  The role of Management is \nalso central to safety and efficiency.   \n \nThe (hu)man aspect of the five \u2018M\u2019s model encompasses issues such as the \ncapabilities of the end user, their size and fuel requirements (elements falling within \nthe \u2018traditional\u2019 realms of psychology and ergonomics).  From a user-centred design \nperspective, the (hu)man is the ultimate design forcing function.  It cannot be \nchanged.  When (hu)man and machine elements come together they perform a \nmission.  It is usually the machine and mission components on which developers and \ndesigners fixate.  Note that when discussing \u2018efficiency\u2019, it is the efficiency of \nperforming the mission which is being referred to.  \n \nHowever, designers and engineers must not only work within the bounds of the \ntechnology, the capabilities of the end-users and the physical aspects of the Medium, \nthey must also abide by the rules and norms of society (the societal Medium).  The \nperformance standards for human-machine systems are primarily determined by \n 5\nsocietal norms (regulations) e.g. the level of redundancy required (aircraft \ncertification) or minimum standards of user competence (flight crew licensing).  \nManagement must work within these rules.  The airline Management is the link \nbetween the (hu)Man, Machine, Mission and Medium.  It performs the integrating role \nto ensure compliance with operating, licensing and certification requirements, and it \npromotes safe and efficient operations.  \n \nThe inter-relationships between the five \u2018M\u2019s are described in Figure 1.  In the case \nof an airliner, the pilots fly the aircraft to achieve a well-defined goal (the union of \n(hu)Man and Machine to perform a Mission).  The Management tasks this Mission \nand ensures the crew and aircraft conform to the regulatory requirements (societal \nMedium) and are fit to endure the demands placed upon it by the physical Medium.   \n-------------------------------------------------------- \nINSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE \n-------------------------------------------------------- \n \nThe Mission of a commercial aircraft is a simple one: to deliver passengers at the \ngreatest possible speed and comfort while maintaining the highest possible standards \nof safety and economy.  These contradictory requirement define what is characterised \nas \u2018efficiency, but therein lies the catch.  Regulatory objectives are specifically aimed \nat enhancing safety.  Organisational aims, however, need to balance safety against \nperformance, comfort and economy.   \n \nTo illustrate how efficiency gains may not be realised through the modification of \njust one part of the system, four case studies are examined in what follows:  The \nhuman dimension to increasing operating efficiency on the airport ramp; increasing \n 6\nefficiency by flight crew rostering; increasing efficiency through direct routing; and \nincreasing efficiency through increased flight deck automation.  \n \n \nINCREASING EFFICIENCY ON THE AIRPORT RAMP \n \nThe prime drivers to enhancing operational efficiency in the last decade have been \nthe low-cost carriers.  These operators now command a significant proportion of the \nmarket and have been responsible for the larger airlines having to achieve increases in \nefficiency to remain competitive.  As margins are low on each seat sold, load factors \nneed to be high and turnarounds need to be swift.  However, some attempts to \ndecrease operating costs may have a \u2018hidden\u2019 price.   This is evident when decreasing \nthe aircraft\u2019s time on the ramp is examined.   \n \nAn aircraft on the ground is both failing to generate revenue and is also costing the \nairline money as airport gates are charged by the minute.  In terms of Mission \nefficiency, it is beneficial to minimise this time, something the low cost operators \nhave been successful in achieving.  However, a broader perspective needs to be taken, \nbut before going further it needs emphasising that all aspects of Management, directly \nor indirectly, involve people.  What appear to be simple contractual or accounting \ndecisions taken in an office have a human element associated with them which \ninfluences both airline safety and efficiency.   \n \nIn 1997 the cost of accidents and incidents on the airport ramp was estimated to be \n$2 billion, much of which was uninsured losses.  However, these direct costs \n 7\nrepresent only a small proportion of the overall cost, e.g. damage to aircraft; repair \nand replacement of damaged parts.  Indirect costs are far more substantial, e.g. \ncompensation; re-scheduling of services; service fees; replacement aircraft; loss of \nperishable cargo, etc.  Airports Council International (1996) reported that 84% of \nramp accidents occurred when ground equipment struck an aircraft (known as \u2018ramp \nrash\u2019).  The following are typical: \n \n\u2018Refuelling vehicle reversed into a\/c engine, causing damage to the engine fan \ncowling.  No external visual assistance available to driver of vehicle.\u2019  \n(Accident to Boeing 737-200, Manchester, February 1994: UK CAA database). \n \n\u2018RH wing tip hit by lorry.  Driver allegedly had no \u201cbanksman\u201d to marshal the \nreversing lorry onto the aft cargo door.\u2019  (Accident to Boeing 737-300, \nEdinburgh, November 1996: UK CAA database). \n \n\u2018[Company name] catering truck backed into LH aileron causing damage to the \nLH aileron and wing structure, after servicing another airplane. Driver of truck \nfailed to follow [company name] procedures outlined in company station \noperations manual (SOM), by not utilizing a guide.\u2019  (Accident to Avro 146 \nRJ85A, Minneapolis, October 2000: FAA Incident report 2000102902463 C).  \n \nThe conduct of personnel and vehicles on the airport ramp is prescribed in \ncompany procedures, regulations and advisory material e.g.  CAP  642 (CAA, 1995); \nIATA Airport Handling Manual (IATA, 1998).  In the accidents described, if \n 8\nrequirements had been followed it is unlikely that these incidents would have \noccurred.   \nAn observational study at a major UK airport (Thomas, 1998; Harris & Thomas, \n2001) showed that deviations from recommended procedures when servicing aircraft \nwere commonplace.  For example:  \n\u2022 In 68% of all turnarounds, ground equipment was positioned around the \naircraft without the help of a guidesman.   \n\u2022 During 5% of turnarounds, vehicles were driven under the wings of aircraft \nwithout exterior guidance.  \n\u2022 In 19% of turnarounds at least one vehicle was reversed up to the side of the \naircraft without the external guidance.  \n \nHowever, these observations merely describe what happened, not why.  When the \nreasons underlying such behaviours are proffered a more complex picture emerges. \nThe most common explanation for such deviations in procedures (what Reason, 1990 \nterms \u2018violations\u2019) was one of time and money.  Aircraft servicing is usually provided \nby a sub-contractor.  To keep prices down and margins high, sub-contractors are \nunder considerable time (hence financial) pressures.  Competition is encouraged to \nsuppress prices.  To remain competitive, sub-contractors operate with the minimum \nnumber of personnel.  As a result, a common explanation for procedural violations \nwas that \u2018no one was available to see me back\u2019 or \u2018there was no time to get someone \nto help me reverse\u2019.  Reason (1997) suggested that such violations are quietly \noverlooked by management (until something goes wrong).  These suggestions were \ngiven strong support by Bennett & Shaw (2003) in an ethnographic study of ramp \nworkers.  Deviations in safe operating procedures were frequently condoned (in fact \n 9\nthey were tacitly encouraged) to ensure on-time departures and maintain the \nprofitability of the ground servicing supplier and the airline.    \n  \nThe root cause for such behaviours, though, resides within the contracts branches \nof the airlines.  Competition between suppliers keeps prices low and punitive clauses \nare written into contracts to punish late or non-delivery.  There is an argument to be \nmade that if margins were not eroded to the bare minimum, then incidences of ramp \nrash would begin to decrease.  There would be someone available to guide the driver \nof a reversing truck.  The provision of supplies may cost slightly more but the airline \nmay save large amounts from the reduced requirement for aircraft repair, delays, \ninsurance premiums, etc.  Arguing that a sub-contractor is responsible for these \naspects of ramp safety is only a partial solution and does not address the root cause of \nthe problem.  Taking a wider view of financial management which encompasses \ndirect and indirect effects on worker behaviour may be beneficial in terms of \nefficiency and safety.  The action of people writing and negotiating contracts does \ninfluence human behaviour.  Paying more may ultimately promote efficiency and cost \nless. \n \n \nINCREASING EFFICIENCY THROUGH FLIGHT CREW ROSTERING \n \nHigh levels of efficiency in low-cost airlines require that crews are utilised to the \nmaximum but without resulting in stress and fatigue.  This has not always been the \ncase (Bennett, 2003).  These pilots may fly up to eight sectors in a working day.  \nLittle time will be spent in the cruise.  Most time will be devoted to the high workload \nphases of departure, approach and landing, and turnaround on the gate.  Gander et al. \n 10\n(1988) suggested the problems associated with these operations were twofold: \nirregular hours of work and high workload from the number of sectors.   \n \nAirworthiness authorities have strict duty time limitations.  A survey of these by \nCabon et al. (2002) showed 13 criteria used in determining rest periods between \nflights (e.g. number of legs flown; reporting time; duration of legs).  No country, \nhowever, used more than 11 factors, and some used only two or three.  These duty \ntime regulations highlight the conflicting requirements of safety and efficiency.  \nSafety would be enhanced with more rest between flights but this is economically \ninefficient.  More rest periods requires more crew and higher away from home \naccommodation costs.  \n \nIn recent years, incidences of stress and depression have began to increase as a \nresult of factors such as worries about company stability and large numbers of last \nminute flying schedule changes, which are common as a result of crew being used \nmore \u2018efficiently\u2019 (Little et al., 1990).  These factors are also associated with drinking \nand flying behaviour (Maxwell & Harris, 1999).   UK Health and Safety executive \nestimates that work-related stress, depression or anxiety account for thirteen million \nlost working days every year in Britain (HSE, 2005).   \n \nIn a trial of a new flight rostering system (Stewart, 2005) it was found that changes \ncould bring about both safety and efficiency gains.  However, as a result of the \nregulatory Medium these benefits were not easy to achieve.  Stewart noted that prior \nto the trial rostering practices were compliant with CAP 371 flight time limitations \n 11\nguidelines (CAA, 2004) but that these were written four decades ago.  In the normal \nflight roster crews would work six days \u2018on\u2019 and three days \u2018off\u2019: \n\u2022 Day 1: backward diurnal phase shift  - starting 05:00  \n\u2022 Day 4: forward diurnal phase shift  - starting 13:00  \n\u2022 Day 6: end work at 23:00-24:00 with an option to extend duty to 03:00. \n \nThis roster resulted in decrements in performance as the six days \u2018on\u2019 progressed.  \nIn the trial the company was granted a temporary waiver from current flight time \nlegislation to evaluate a slow wave shift pattern (five \u2018earlies\u2019; two days off; five \n\u2018lates\u2019; four days off).   The revised shift pattern was found to: \n\u2022 Reduce operational risk. \n\u2022 Produce less fatiguing work patterns and reduce crew duty hours. \n\u2022 Produce a reduction in insurance liability of the order of \u00a34 million. \n\u2022 Improve crew productivity by 7%. \n\u2022 Increase roster stability. \n\u2022 Improve crew lifestyle and reduce sickness. \n\u2022 Improve pilot retention and reduce training liability. \n \nAll of these factors represent an increase in operational efficiency.  It needs to be \nnoted, though, that the company had to be granted a temporary waiver from UK flight \ntime legislations.  Potential gains in efficiency (and safety) from the (hu)Man \ncomponent in the system are often bounded by regulatory structures  which need to be \nchanged before advances can be made.    \n \n 12\nThe effects of the Mission, repetitive sectors, operating across time zones and \nworking unsociable hours are only a few aspects impacting on the (hu)Man in the \nsystem.   The recent economic Medium has made a significant transformation in the \noperation of airlines considerably influencing the utilisation of the human resources \nwithin them.   \n \n \nINCREASING OPERATING EFFICIENCY BY PROMOTING DIRECT \nROUTING \n \nAir Traffic Control oversees an aircraft on every step of its journey.  Prior to \ntakeoff, pilots inform ATC of their flight plan and are allocated a take-off slot, given \nweather information, and informed of restrictions concerning the areas over which \nthey will fly.  Once in the air they are passed from ATC at the airport to en route air \ntraffic controllers.   When being handed off from one sector to another pilots give a \nfull status report to the new controller. This process is repeated until the aircraft is \nnear its destination, where they are given a final altitude and position and are \nallocated a slot and runway for landing.  This is an extremely inefficient way of flying \nfrom A to B.  It is not the most direct route and it does not make best use of the \nMedium, e.g. prevailing winds and optimum altitudes for performance.  \n \nFuture air traffic management (ATM) practices will require aircraft to navigate in a \ndifferent manner.  This concept, known as Direct Routing or \u2018Free Flight\u2019 will \nsignificantly affect the pilot\u2019s role and responsibilities.  In Free Flight, responsibility \nfor ATM will be delegated to the flight deck (self-assured separation).  Aircraft will \nfly direct routes and manoeuvre freely at their optimum speed and altitude, without \n 13\nconsultation with ATC.  IN this way, they will spend less time in the air and use less \nfuel, significantly increasing efficiency.  The impetus to move to such a system is also \ndriven by the fact that the current system is inefficient in its use of the airspace \navailable and unless changes are made, it will be impossible to cope with the \nincreasing growth in air traffic.  For example, it is expected that air traffic in Europe \nwill double by 2015 (Eurocontrol, 2002).   \n \nHowever, changes to the physical airspace demand wide-ranging changes \nthroughout all other components of the system.  To optimise efficiency gains as a \nresult of changes in the Mission both ATC and aircraft need to be re-equipped with \nnew navigation and surveillance equipment (Machine); crew need to be trained to use \nthis equipment and associated new procedures (huMan); company management is \nresponsible for integrating these mission, machine and human aspects and \ninternational regulatory agreement is required for the approval of equipment and \noperation of Free Flight airspace.    \n \nMany human factors specialists a currently working in this area.  Changes in the \nairspace to allow free flight cannot be fully exploited if aircraft are not equipped with \nsuitable display technology to allow pilots to manoeuvre to maintain separation from \nother traffic, avoid weather and undertake other aspects of real-time flight planning.  \nMuch work is being embarked upon developing such Cockpit Display of Traffic \nInformation systems.   NASA Ames research centre has engaged in a great deal of \neffort developing such systems (see http:\/\/human-\nfactors.arc.nasa.gov\/ihh\/cdti\/cdti.html).  Work has principally centred on the real-time \nrepresentation of 4-dimensional traffic information to aid situation awareness and \n 14\ndecision making (e.g. Johnson et al, 1997; Johnson et al; 1999) and the development \nof rules for resolving airborne conflicts (e.g. Johnson et al., 2005).  However, without \nautomated assistance pilots were found to be inefficient at resolving conflicts, \n(Johnson et al., 2003), clearly demonstrating that training is also required to \ncomplement display design to maximise efficiency  \n \nHowever, while resolving potential conflicts is a central part of the pilots\u2019 new \ntasks it is not the only one.  For utilisation of Free Flight airspace considerable effort \nwill need to be expended on training and educating pilots in all aspects of aircraft \nperformance, e.g. the effects of altitude and temperature; wind; and conserving energy \nin both the climb and descent phases.  Further increases in automation may help to \nsome extent, however, simply continuing to increase the degree of automated \nassistance is not a universal panacea in increasing operating efficiency. \n \n \nINCREASING EFFICIENCY THROUGH INCREASED FLIGHT DECK \nAUTOMATION \n \nWeiner and Curry (1980) probably suggested that automation offers benefits in \nfour basic areas: Safety; Reliability; Economy and Comfort. Ignoring the latter as it \nfalls outwith the scope of this discourse, without a doubt, automated assistance has \ncontributed significantly to safety, for example CAT III autoland capability.  This has \nalso had the simultaneous effects of increasing on-time arrivals and reducing the \nnumber of weather-related diversions, hence dramatically increasing operational \nefficiency. However the fallacious argument that safety can be improved by removing \n 15\nthe operator from the system, thereby avoiding error, must be avoided.  There are \nthree problems with this approach.  Firstly, automated devices are designed and built \nby human beings (just the nature of error changes). Secondly, such devices are not \nperfect and have the potential for generating errors.  Thirdly, a highly trained \nindividual who understands the automation is required to monitor and intervene when \nautomation parameters are exceeded or an unexpected event in the operating \nenvironment occurs.  Automation is only partially context aware.  For example, a \nCAT III autoland system cannot cope with a runway incursion.  Human intervention \nis required (see Bainbridge, 1987 for more \u2018ironies of automation\u2019). \n \nIn terms of economy and reliability the autothrottle and autopilot can fly the \naircraft more smoothly, accurately and economically than a pilot.  They adapt to \nenvironmental disturbances faster and can fly complex thrust management schedules.  \nAs a result, aircraft can be operated more economically under autoflight control and \ncan function more smoothly, producing less \u2018wear and tear\u2019 thereby reducing \nmaintenance costs.  Furthermore, the onboard sensors and automation allow for more \nprecise control and navigation allowing shorter flying times, and hence increasing \nefficiency. In some sections of airspace vertical separations are being reduced to \n1,000 feet and in Free Flight area aircraft are required to self assure in-trail \nseparations.  \n \nHowever, despite the apparent operational efficiency gains described it has yet to \nbe completely established if automation reduces whole lifecycle costs.  Modern \naircraft are equipped with multiple automation modes to endow them with as much \nflexibility as possible.  This has benefits and drawbacks. Flexibility increases the \n 16\nrange of responses available to a pilot in a given situation, but can also overburden \nthem during critical periods of high workload.  More options increase the cognitive \ndemands on the pilot.  They must now be familiar with all the modes available and \nknowledge of how and when to apply them.   For example, the Airbus A320 has nine \nautothrottle modes, ten vertical navigation modes and seven lateral navigation modes.  \nThis places considerable training demands on pilots, hence simultaneously increases \ncosts and opportunity for error.   \n \nDekker (2004) further attempts to disabuse the notion that automation reduced \nlabour costs.  He points out that automation made some crew redundant (e.g. the radio \noperators, navigators and flight engineers) but the pilots left to fill the gaps remaining \nwere required to attain competencies beyond their original job mandates.  As a result, \nautomation increased the need to invest in human expertise. Dekker and Hollnagel \n(1999) suggest that procurement of new equipment is often driven by a trade-off \nbetween labour-intensive low-tech systems (with lesser training requirements) and \nhigh-tech systems for which it will be expensive to train and retain operators.  Taking \nan even broader view, the design, development, certification, production and \nmaintenance of highly automated aircraft is undoubtedly far more expensive than that \nfor a simpler machine.  Once training costs are also incorporated, the question still \nremains; taking into account the whole lifecycle of the aircraft, do these costs \nassociated with highly automated aircraft outweigh the operational efficiency gains? \n \n Notwithstanding the previous argument, there are two factors with their roots in \nthe societal Medium which severely limit any further efficiency gains in the human \nelement of the socio-technical system of operating a commercial aircraft.  Firstly, the \n 17\noperating regulations require a minimum of two qualified flight deck crew (Code of \nFederal Regulations, Title 14; Joint Airworthiness Requirement \u2013 Operations [JAR-\nOPS]).  Until the regulations are changed, no matter how highly automated the \naircraft is, the airline will still be required to place two highly qualified, highly paid \npilots on the flight deck.  Secondly, many departure and arrival air traffic control \nprocedures still cannot exploit the automation available in modern aircraft.  This is as \na result of such factors as the arrangement of the airspace near the airport, air traffic \nprocedures not congruent with the automaton and\/or a lack of knowledge on the part \nof Air Traffic Controllers about utilising the capabilities of a modern Flight \nManagement System to best effect.  As a result, the flight crew have to semi-manually \n\u2018fly\u2019 the aircraft and most automation is not particularly \u2018efficient\u2019 in these \ncircumstances.  Flight deck automation has reduced crew workload where it was \nalready low (e.g. in the cruise) but has increased it dramatically where it was already \nhigh, e.g. in terminal manoeuvring areas. Wiener (1989) called this \u2018clumsy\u2019 \nautomation.  Basically, the human pilot will always be needed as automation is never \nfully context aware. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n \nSignificant increases resulting from enhancements in the efficiency of the (hu)Man \ncomponent of the system alone are unlikely.  The Mark I Human Being cannot easily \nbe re-designed.  As a result the whole system has to be designed around the \ncapabilities and limitations of the end user, be it pilot, air traffic controller or ground \nstaff.  When the human being is pushed towards its operating limits in an effort to \nincrease efficiency, decreases in overall efficiency may result, as argued in the \nattempts to increase efficiency on the airport ramp.  However, when the capabilities \n 18\nand limitations of the human are better understood, then efficiency and safety benefits \nmay accrue, as described in the section on flight crew rostering.  In one instance it \nwas forgotten that Management involves people.  In the other aspect, perhaps because \nit was blatantly obvious, it was central to the plan.   \n \nOperational efficiency will only be marginally enhanced through changes made \nsolely to the Machine or Medium component.  Automation does not replace human \nwork; it merely changes its nature. Two members of flight crew (as a result of the \nregulatory Medium) will still be required on the flight deck.  Significant changes in \nefficiency could be achieved by operating aircraft with a single member of flight crew \n(up to 18% of direct operating costs in commuter aircraft are crew related). There is \nthe potential to fly safely with a single pilot.  The military operate complex aircraft \nwith one pilot on a regular basis. Intelligent automation to aid and monitor the pilot \nhas been under development for sometime (e.g. Schulte and St\u00fctz, 2001; St\u00fctz and \nSchulte, 2001).  Furthermore, removing one crew member may actually enhance \ncertain aspects of safety.  Poor crew communication has been implicated in many \naccidents (Civil Aviation Authority, 1998).  Removing one pilot removes this error \nmode! However, as has been argued, high levels of automation may not actually \nreduce costs.  Savings on flight crew may be offset by other factors in design, \noperation and maintenance.  Changes in the structure of airspace (and the resulting \nnature of operations) which may lead to large potential gains in efficiency can only be \nexploited if the aircraft (Machine) is equipped to do so  and the crew and trained in a \ncomplementary fashion.  \n \n 19\nPerhaps the greatest lesson, though, is that significant changes in efficiency will \nnot be driven by changes in the (hu)Man, Machine or Mission alone. Revolution is \nrequired, not evolution.  Ultimately, changes in efficiency are dictated by what the \nMedium, in the form of society and legislation, will tolerate and these aspects of the \nMedium are risk averse.  Neither Human Factors nor Engineering can be considered in \nisolation from its sociotechnical context. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAirports Council International (1993).  Ramp Safety Handbook.
