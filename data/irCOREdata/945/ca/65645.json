It uses a random sample of Incapacity \nBenefit claims, and population counts of mortality and Census morbidity for local government \ndistricts. Although, there is little correspondence between sickness absence claims by specific \ncause and mortality, all cause sickness absence has a strong relationship with all cause \nmortality (male r 0.74, p=0.00; female r 0.64, p=0.00) and it also has a very strong \nrelationship with the Census measures of morbidity: LLTI (male r 0.98, p=0.00; female r 0.97, \np=0.00) and \u2019not good health\u2019 (male r 0.99, p=0.00; female r 0.96, p=0.00). Incapacity Benefit \nclaims by all causes has the potential to provide an ongoing measure of area level health in \nEngland and Wales. \n \n103 words \n \nKeywords: Incapacity Benefit, sickness absence, LLTI, Census, mortality, morbidity. \n 2 \nIntroduction \nThe high numbers of people who are out of work and claiming social security benefits on the \ngrounds of long-term sickness absence has become an increasingly salient policy concern \nacross Europe (OECD 2003). This is especially so in England and Wales where the number \nof long-term sickness absence claims have increased rapidly over the past three decades \nfrom 0.5 million in 1975 to 2.4 million in 2002 (Blondal and Pearson, 1995; McCormick, 2000; \nDWP, 2003a). 8.4 percent of the working age population currently claim social security \nbenefits on the grounds of ill health compared to 2.6 percent for unemployment and 2.3 \npercent for lone parenthood (DWP, 2003a). These claims also account for the largest chunk \nof social security expenditure, around \u00a37 billion per annum (McCormick, 2000) or 1.5% of \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) (OECD, 2003). \n \nIn England and Wales, people who are absent from work due to long-term sickness may be \nentitled to claim Incapacity Benefit (IB). This is a social security cash benefit paid to people \nwho are assessed by their General Practitioner (GP) doctor or a Benefits Agency doctor as \nbeing incapable of work due to illness and who meet certain contribution conditions (see \nDWP, 2004). IB is similar in remit to the long-term sickness and disability insurance schemes \nof other Western countries such as the USA\u2019s Social Security Disability Insurance and the \ndisability pensions of Germany and Sweden (OECD, 2003). There are three rates of IB which \nare receivable up to pensionable age: a lower rate paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness to \npeople who are not entitled to employer funded Statutory Sick Pay (SSP); and a higher rate \npaid for weeks 29 to 52 after entitlement to SSP or lower rate IB has ceased. The third, a \nlong-term IB rate, applies to people who have been sick for more than a year; this category \ncomprises the largest number of claimants (McCormick, 2000). The focus in this paper is on \nlong-term IB.  \n \nThe substantial increase in the number and costs of IB claimants in England and Wales, as \nwell as rising numbers of claims based on more manageable medical conditions, such as \nback pain or depression (DWP 2003a; DWP, 2003b), has initiated a debate about whether IB \nclaims are actually related to health status, morbidity, and even mortality. One point of view \n 3 \nargues that the increases in claims are more related to changing patterns of employment \nrather than an actual increase in the prevalence of ill health or incapacity (Disney and Webb, \n1991; Armstrong, 1998; Fieldhouse and Hollywood, 1999; Beatty and Fothergill, 2002; DWP, \n2003b). On the other hand, IB claims are medically certified by GPs and there is some \nindividual level research evidence from recent cohort studies to suggest that medically \ncertified sickness absence does reflect actual morbidity and mortality (Marmot, Feeney et al., \n1995; Kivimaki, Head et al., 2003; Vahtera, Pentti et al., 2004). \n \nOur study engages with this debate as it provides a population level examination of the \nrelationship between claims for medically certified long-term sickness absence (IB) and other \nindicators of morbidity and mortality in England and Wales. Specifically, we were interested in \nhow the number of IB claims related to disease specific and all cause standardised mortality \nrates and all cause standardised illness rates derived from the 2001 Census health questions. \n \nMethods \nIndirectly Standardised Illness Rates (SIRs) and Standardised Mortality Rates (SMRs) were \ncalculated for the working age population (16-64 males, 16-59 females) for the 376 local \ngovernment areas of local authority districts or unitary authorities (these will both be referred \nto as LAs) in England and Wales. The working age, economically active populations of the LA \ndistricts in this study vary considerably, ranging from 7,906 to 304,418 for males (average \n44,909; standard deviation 29,578) and from 6,894 to 294,182 for females (average 42,257; \nstandard deviation 28,678). Two LA districts, City of London and Isles of Scilly, have been \nexcluded because their populations are so small that results may be unreliable. Standard \nrates and LA populations at risk were calculated using the Office for National Statistics (ONS) \nmid-year estimates (MYEs) for 2001. \n \nIB SIRs were calculated from event counts of long-term rate (over 12 months) Incapacity \nBenefit (IB) by LA district. These were derived from a 5% sample of claimants in 2002 \nsupplied by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The IB data were obtained by all \nreasons for claim (which we will term \u2018all causes\u2019) and by various conditions. These conditions \n 4 \nwere diagnosed by each claimant\u2019s GP and we obtained data for six broad International \nClassification of Diseases (ICD) codes (10\nth\n revision): F00-F99 mental and behavioural \ndisorders; G00-G99 diseases of the nervous systems; I00-I99 diseases of the circulatory \nsystem; M00-M99 diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue; R00-R99 \nsymptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings not classified elsewhere; and \nS00-T98 injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes. \n \nEvent counts of all cause mortality and various broad causes of death by ICD(10) code \n(equivalent to the diagnosed causes of IB claim listed above) were derived from the Vital \nStatistics table VS3 for the calendar year 2001 disseminated by ONS. Event counts of self-\nreported limiting long-term illness (LLTI) and \u2018Not Good\u2019 health (NGH) for SIRs were obtained \nfrom Standard Table ST016 of the 2001 Census Statistics (ONS, 2003). \n \nNational mortality rates by six broad ICD(10) causes of death were compared with IB rates by \nsix equivalent ICD(10) conditions. SIRs of IB by these specific causes were then correlated \n(Pearson\u2019s r) with SMRs of death by the same causes. Finally, all cause SMRs were \ncorrelated (Pearson\u2019s r) with all cause IB rates, and the Census derived SIRs (LLTI and \nNGH). \n \nResults \nFigures 1a and 1b show the national rates of IB claims and mortality by six broad ICD(10) \ncauses. For all six causes of IB and mortality, they show that male rates exceed those of \nfemales, but this is largely explained by differences in the retirement age of men (65) and \nwomen (60) in England and Wales. The figures also show that there are quite different \npatterns in the national rates of IB and mortality as \u2018mental and behavioural disorders\u2019 have \nthe highest rates of IB but the mortality rate of these conditions is relatively low. Similarly, \nthere are relatively high rates of IB claims relating to \u2018diseases of the musculoskeletal \nsystem\u2019, but again, mortality rates by this cause are low. Conversely, IB claims relating to \ndiseases of the circulatory system are low, but mortality rates by this cause are relatively high, \n 5 \nparticularly for males. Overall, in terms of national rates, there is little correspondence \nbetween IB and mortality rates by specific cause. \n \nOur results also suggest that SIRs of IB by a certain cause are unrelated to SMRs of death by \nthe same cause. Table 1 shows the results of correlations between IB claims and SMRs by \nthe six broad ICD causes. Generally the relationships are not particularly strong especially for \nG00-G99 diseases of the nervous system (male r -0.01, p=0.84; female r 0.02, p=0.66) and \nM00-M99 diseases of the musculoskeletal system (male r 0.07, p=0.20; female r 0.11, \np=0.05). Overall, the correlations are stronger for males than females. This could again be \ndue to the different age structure of the male and female working age populations or, in the \ncase of the physical conditions, perhaps due to the more manual nature of traditional male \nemployment. Despite weak overall relationships, less common IB claims, such as on the \nbasis of I00-I99 circulatory disease (figure 1a), are shown to be a good predictor of mortality \nby that cause (male r 0.53, p=0.00; female r 0.38, p=0.00).  \n \nThe overall lack of relationship between the specific IB and SMR causes is perhaps also due \nto the fact that some conditions, such as F00-F99 mental and behavioural disorders or M00-\nM99 diseases of the musculoskeletal system are common causes of IB claims (see figure 1a) \nbut are relatively rare mortality events (see figure 1b). This is perhaps because the cause of \ndeath is not necessarily due to the same precursor condition. It is possible that IB claims by a \nspecific cause have a stronger relationship with a different cause of death. For example, IB \nclaims due to F00-F99 mental and behavioural disorders relate more strongly to death by \nX60-X84 intentional self-harm (male r 0.40, p=0.00; female r 0.19, p=0.00). \n \nAlthough the results suggest that IB claims by specific causes are not a good indicator of area \nlevel mortality by specific causes, all cause IB claims provide a good indicator of more \ncommon specific and all cause mortality. Table 2 shows the results of correlations between all \ncause IB and the six broad ICD causes of death. The relationships here are only slightly less \nweak than for each specific cause of IB. Table 2 also shows the results of correlations \nbetween all cause IB and other common specific causes of death (no equivalent IB claims) \n 6 \nsuch as diseases of the respiratory system or malignant neoplasms. These correlations are \nmuch stronger suggesting that IB is a good area level indicator of broad cause of death (and \nthe different relationship with V01-V89 land traffic accidents is understandable). The \nrelationship between all cause IB and all cause mortality is very strong (male r 0.74, p=0.00; \nfemale r 0.64, p=0.00). Indeed, the strength of relationship is comparable to that of the more \nwidely used Census SIR measure of LLTI (male r 0.72, p=0.00; female r 0.68, p=0.00) as well \nas the measure NGH (male r 0.76, p=0.00; female r 0.69 p=0.00), newly introduced in the \n2001 Census. Unsurprisingly then, all cause IB has been found to have a very strong \nrelationship with answers to the Census self-assessed health questions LLTI (male r 0.98, \np=0.00; female r 0.97, p=0.00) and NGH (male r 0.99, p=0.00; female r 0.96, p=0.00). \n \nDiscussion \nThis study has provided the first area level analysis of the relationship between long-term \nsickness absence (IB) and mortality in England and Wales. Although it has shown that at area \nlevel specific reasons for long-term sickness (IB) claims are not a good indicator of the same \nspecific causes of mortality, it has shown that all cause long-term sickness absence is a good \npredictor of common causes of death and all cause mortality. The study has also shown that \nsimilar findings of recent cohort studies (Marmot, Feeney et al., 1995; Kivimaki, Head et al., \n2003; Vahtera, Pentti et al., 2004) on the relationship between sickness absence and \nmortality are also applicable at the area level. \n \nThe results of the study also add to the discussion over the rise in claims of long-term \nsickness absence (IB) in England and Wales over the past thirty years. Generally, the growth \nin long-term IB claims has been attributed to changing employment patterns. It has been \nargued that IB is an attractive alternative to unemployment benefit particularly in many \nregions where jobs in heavy industry have disappeared (McCormick, 2000). The results of \nthis study however suggest that the rise in IB claims may also have a basis in the changing \nnature of health complaints. Perhaps, there is an increasing willingness to claim on the basis \nof stress-related F00-F99 mental and behavioural disorders, or the health hangover of heavy \n 7 \nindustry is becoming apparent in the number of claims made on the basis of M00-M99 \ndiseases of the musculoskeletal system. \n \nFurthermore, the study has shown that all cause IB has a similar relationship to all cause \nmortality as the Census derived health indicators of LLTI and NGH. IB data have previously \nbeen overlooked as a source of health information by the wider public health community. This \nis perhaps surprising given its relationship to morbidity and mortality and the fact that all \ncause IB has the advantage of being available as an ongoing measure of health, whereas the \nmore commonly used Census measures are only available decennially. Perhaps more \nresearch is needed into IB as a source of health information before it can be used alongside \nCensus measures as part of local health profiles. \n \nThis study has identified relationships at the area level but we cannot, of course, assume that \nit is the same people being diagnosed with a condition and claiming IB for a particular reason \nand dying of a particular cause. To do so would be to risk the ecological fallacy since \nrelationships identified at area level cannot be assumed to apply at individual level \n(Fieldhouse and Tye, 1996). The Census, Vital Statistics and Incapacity Benefit data were \ncollected over different, but overlapping time periods. The Census is a snapshot for the end of \nApril 2001 with the health measures reported depending on a person\u2019s interpretation of their \nown health and of the meaning of each question at that time. The Vital Statistics are collected \nat the end of the calendar year so many of the deaths recorded for 2001 will be people \npresent at the Census. Similarly, a long-term rate (over 12 months) Incapacity Benefit data \ndownload for May 2002 should almost exclusively contain persons who had reported on their \nhealth in the 2001 Census and it is likely that, at the time of the Census, most claimants will \nhave been suffering from the condition with which they are diagnosed. We must also \nrecognise that the IB data are a 5% sample, so potentially subject to error. \n \n 8 \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for \nmaking available the Incapacity Benefit data.
