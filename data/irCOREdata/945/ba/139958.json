We also report that when asked to characterize\nChinese servant leadership in the public sector, the study respondents consider six\ntypes of servant leadership similar to the West but also three types of Chinese\nextended servant leadership.\nOriginality\/value \u2013 The paper is a first attempt to examine servant leadership in the\npublic sector in China. It not only reports various forms of Chinese servant leadership\norientation, but also compares and contrasts various servant leadership forms between\nChina and the West, highlighting research gaps for future research within the context\nof the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the West.\n4Keywords: Servant leadership, public sector, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\nPaper type: Research paper\nWith the shadow of corporate scandals such as Enron and Worldcom, Tyco, and other\ncompanies in the United States and globally, scholars pointed out that certain styles of\nleadership and management practices including \u201cbullying leadership, abusive\nleadership, unethical practices, toxic emotions, social isolation and alienation in the\nworkplace, and the violation of employees\u2019 psychological well-being and work-life\nbalance\u201d may contribute to these negative phenomena in the organization (Sendjaya et\nal, 2008, p.402). Therefore, in order to help restore employees\u2019 trust, commitment and\nconfidence in management, scholars view servant leadership as one avenue to\nachieving such a goal (Farling et al., 1999; Page and Wong, 2000; Patterson et al.,\n2003; Winston, 2004; Winston and Ryan, 2007; Sendjaya, 2003; Sendjaya et al, 2008).\nIn addition, organizations are competing in a global environment and are under\npressure to attract and retain high-performing employees. Thus for both governance\nand talent management purposes, the concept of servant leadership is at the core of\ndrawing, keeping and motivating high performance employees (Fry et al., 2007).\nMoreover, Pfeffer (2003) proposes that it is a leader\u2019s responsibility to help one\u2019s\nemployees to strike a balance between their spiritual world and their working roles.\nHence, scholars consider servant leadership as an effective management practice in\n5helping an organization to compete with others in the context of globalization and\ncreating a balance for employees\u2019 external work and inner life (Fry et al., 2007).\nAlthough scholars have discussed and described servant leadership almost entirely in\nthe American context (Winston and Ryan, 2008), overall commentators have not\ngiven sufficient attention to exploring servant leadership in other cultural contexts.\nIn addressing this research gap, this paper explores the relevance of servant leadership\nas applied to the public sector in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). In this study,\nwe ask: Would the concept of servant leadership have the same meaning in China, or,\nis there an alternative term in the Chinese language that closely relates to the concept\nof servant leadership? How do people construe the notion of servant leadership in the\npublic sector of the PRC? To address these questions, this paper first provides a\ncomprehensive review of the extant literature on servant leadership in the West and in\nChina respectively. Then, this study reports the results of an inductive research\napproach to investigate servant leadership in public sector in the Chinese context\n6Servant Leadership: Its Definition, Nature and Dimensions\nGreenleaf (1970) an influential advocate of the servant as leader described the\nphenomenon as; \u201cIt [servant leadership] begins with the natural feeling that one wants\nto serve. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. The difference manifests\nitself in the care the servant takes\u2014first to ensure that other people\u2019s highest priority\nneeds are served. The best test is: Do those served grow as persons; do they, while\nbeing served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, and more likely\nthemselves to become servants?\u201d (p. 4) Servant leadership puts and promotes\nfollowers\u2019 interest in the first place (Barbuto and Wheeler, 2006; Greenleaf, 1977). \nServant leaders encourage followers to intelligently grow, be creative, self-manage\nand serve people. This leads to the betterment of society and advocates acceptance,\ntolerance, empathy, love, forgiveness, and adherence to the Golden Rule of \u201cdo unto\nothers as you shall have them do unto you\u201d. Fry et al. (2007, p.6) summarized this\ndefinition as \u201cthe servant-leader is servant-first, an attitude that flows from a\ndeep-rooted, natural inclination to serve [followers]\u201d at work.\nExcluding conceptual papers (Page and Wong, 2000; Patterson et al., 2003; Winston,\n2004; Winston and Ryan, 2007) and Laub\u2019s (1999) empirical operationalization of the\nservant organization, but based on empirical validation of servant leadership from\nBarbuto and Wheeler (2006), Dennis and Bocarnea (2005), Dennis and Winston\n7(2003), Ehrhart (2004), Liden et al. (2008) as well as Sendjaya (2003; 2008), this\npaper identifies the following dimensions of servant leadership in the extant North\nAmerican literature ( see Table 1 for an illustration):\n-------------------------------\nTable 1 about here\n------------------------------\nLeadership Styles in the PRC Context\nHaving examined various forms of servant leadership in the West, Winston and Ryan\n(2008) suggests that the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior\nEffectiveness Research Program\u2019s (GLOBE) humane orientation construct shows the\nidea of servant leadership embedded in cultural concepts, ranging from African\n(Ubuntu, Harambee); East Asian (Daoist, Confucianism); Mediterranean (Jewish);\nand Indian (Hindu) value systems. However, a review of the extant literature\nidentifies three major driving forces for the formulation of Chinese Servant leadership:\nConfucianism (Snell and Tseng, 2003; Winston and Ryan, 2007), Daoism (Johnson,\n2000; Kakabadse et al., 2002; Winston and Ryan, 2007) and Communist ideology (Fu\nand Tsui, 2003; Snell and Tseng, 2003).\n8Confucianism\nFu and Tsui (2003, p.427) suggested the relevance of Confucian virtues in affecting\nChinese leadership as following:\n\uf0b7 The class system\u2014\u201cWu lun\u201d (five cardinal relationships), particularly \ndetermined by courtesy;\n\uf0b7 Obedience\u2014respect to seniors, officers; reliable\/dependable; \nloyalty\/faithfulness\n\uf0b7 Doctrine of the mean\u2014moderation; tolerance; forgiveness, wisdom; avoid\nextremes;\n\uf0b7 The Chinese term, Renqing\u2014benevolence, righteousness.\nAlso, Cheung and Chan (2008) suggested that magnanimity and sensitivity to other\npeople (including subordinates), keeping promises and justice are the virtues of\nConfucian leadership. Moreover, with specific reference to servant leadership,\nWinston and Ryan (2008) and Yuan (2002) also added morality, love, altruism,\nkindness, charity, compassion, goodness, perfect virtue, true selfhood, benefiting\nothers as Confucian servant leadership style.\nLast, but not least, Han and Altman (2009) reported that positive features in\nsupervisor-subordinate guanxi leadership include perceived supervisor support care\nand protection, recognition of subordinates, interactional justice, the quality of the\nsupervisor-subordinate relationship outside work, the quality of the supervisor\u2019s\n9positive attributes and subordinate\u2019s positive attributes, all of whichoverlap with the\nidea of servant leadership.\nIn terms of trust and empowerment, critical elements of Western servant leadership,\nthere are no studies that indicate it is inclusive or exclusive in Chinese servant\nleadership. Wong et al. (2003) findings on trust in the supervisor and Zhang et al.\u2019s\n(2007) study of empowerment, showed that trust in supervisor and empowerment are\nrelatively independent constructs from other organizational and leadership variables.\nDaoism\nDaoist leadership with an emphasis on conformity to the \u201cdao\u201d or \u201cthe way\u201d has\nevolved over the past 2,500 years, with its creator, Lao Zi, being a contemporary of\nConfucius (Cheung and Chan, 2008). The extant literature suggests that in relation to\nservant leadership, Daoist servant leadership includes the following characters or\nbehaviors: vision, embracing insight and wisdom; serving the community (Kakabadse\net al., 2002); maintaining a low profile (i.e., humility), leading by example, and\nempowering people through ownership of the task to do the work (Johnson, 2000;\nWinston and Ryan, 2007).\nCommunist Ideology\n10\nAccording to the Chinese Communist Party Constitution (1997) summarized by Fu\nand Tsui (2003, p.427), Communist leadership should display the following\ncharacteristics:\n\uf0b7 Willingness to serve the people whole-heartedly, even at the expense of\nthemselves;\n\uf0b7 Devotion to the realization of communist moral education;\n\uf0b7 Hard work;\n\uf0b7 Belief in and reliance on people;\n\uf0b7 Placement of collective interests in front of self interests;\n\uf0b7 Abiding by Party policies and state laws and maintenance of unity;\n\uf0b7 Loyalty and honesty to the Party;\n\uf0b7 Resistance against corruption;\n\uf0b7 Promotion of Communist moral codes, and readiness to sacrifice one\u2019s life at \ntimes of difficulty and danger.\nAlthough the term of servant leadership may not be mentioned explicitly in the\nChinese communist context, its concept is not new. Even after economic reforms,\nChinese schools, organizations, and society at large are characterized by active\nprograms promoting public service-oriented government. Lei Feng (1940\u20131962), a\nrole model in the People\u2019s Liberation army, exemplified the official work values of\nthe model Chinese Communist employee by behaviors such as \u201ccarrying strangers\u2019\nheavy loads, washing colleagues\u2019 clothes as they slept, and on one occasion, giving\naway his own packed lunch\u201d (Snell and Tseng, 2003, p.314). The teachings of Lei\nFeng include: \u201cXue Lei Feng, shu xin feng\u2019 (Emulate Lei Feng, establishing a new\npractice, \u2018Xuexi Lei Feng, shuli gongchanzhuyi lixiang\u2019 (Emulate Lei Feng,\nestablishing Communist ideals), and \u2018Xuexi Lei Feng haobangyang\u2014fayang jianku\nfendoude jingsheng\u2019 (Study Lei Feng\u2019s fine example\u2014develop the spirit for better \n11\nstruggle)\u201d (Snell and Tseng, 2003, p.314). With such values in mind Snell and Tseng\n(2003) commented that the spirit of Lei Feng\u2019s writing is similar to the idea of servant\nleadership.\nSince China\u2019s open door policy, together with its economic reforms, of the last two\ndecades, the drive for organisational efficiency and effectiveness, and global\ncompetitiveness over the last two decades has propelled managerial reform and\norganizational reinvention, which has impacted in the Chinese public sector. In 1982,\nthe Party launched a socialist spiritual civilization construction program aimed at\n\u201c instilling straight and clean thinking, cultural participation, orderliness, tidiness, and\ngood manners\u201d \u201cthrough ideological exhortation, re-education and thought reform.\u201d\nThis still remains a prominent Party program and a criterion in the performance\nappraisal of state civil servants (Snell and Tseng, 2003, p.314). Thus, the promotion\nof the socialist spiritual civilization construction program, is coincidentally akin to\nGreenleaf\u2019s (1977) servant leaders (Snell and Tseng, 2003).\nIn the 17th National Congress, President Hu Jintao recently declared the importance\nof developing a public service-oriented government. President Hu Jintao has called\nfor: \u201cthe government to improve its service to the people\u201d and he proposed that \u201ca fair,\ncapable and sustainable public service will help build a harmonious society\u201d. \u201cThe\n12\nultimate goal of building a service-oriented government is to enhance the\ngovernment's capability and level of service\u201d and \u201cthe key points in strengthening\npublic services are ensuring and improving people's livelihoods\u201d with the\n\u201cgovernment\u2019s obligation to provide fast, convenient and high quality services for\ncitizens.\u201d As a result, \u201cthe quality of public services will become a crucial standard in\nevaluating government work\u201d (Xinhua News, 2008). Such initiatives for public\nservice quality enhancement foster the development of servant leadership in Chinese\npublic sector management.\nWe have just discussed the extant literature on servant leadership in the West and the\ncultural roots for Chinese, servant leadership, in particular in contemporary China. In\naddition, as one of the fastest developing economies in the world, China is both of\ntheoretical and practical importance to understand whether servant leadership is a\nrelevant and\/or critical concept. If servant leadership is not an applicable concept\nwithin the context of China and its developments, then we question whether it may be\napplicable elsewhere and whether scholars should reconfigure it as a Western\nconstruct, thereby embedding this significant aspect of leadership style in a Western\ndiscourse. Additionally, \u201ca potential criticism of servant leadership is that it focuses\nsolely on the individual needs of employees, which may or may not benefit the\norganization\u201d (Fry et al., 2007, p.2). Thus, servant leadership may be a more natural\n13\nmodel for application in the public sector than in the private sector due to the public\nsector\u2019s not-for-profit and service orientation.\nNevertheless, irrespective of previous inquiry into the Chinese leadership phenomena,\nscholars as yet know little of whether the concept of servant leadership has the same\nmeaning in China or whether there is an alternative term in the Chinese language that\nclosely relates to the concept of servant leadership (Cheung and Chan, 2008).\nTowards this end, this paper provides empirical data about public sector people\u2019s\nperceptions on servant leadership in their particular workplace and with reference to\nspecific events. The exploratory nature of this research required that an inductive\napproach be adopted as the research method.\nResearch Method\nPilot Survey\nSample, Procedures and Results\nThe pilot survey reported here explores whether the concept of servant leadership has\nthe same meaning in China as it does in the West, or whether there is an alternative\nChinese term that closely relates to the concept of servant leadership. Towards this\nend, a semi structured interview format was adopted whereby this study collected\nconcrete examples of servant leadership in the Chinese public sector where this study\nused Chinese term(s) for servant leadership.\n14\nPilot survey consisted of interviewing four Chinese senior civil servants and four\nChinese employees from the non-public sector in a new economically booming\ncoastal city in South China. Fifty percent male, the group had an average age of 35\nand 6 years work experience respectively,\nThe authors of this paper used interviews as the main data collection method in\neliciting responses. After presenting the summarized servant leadership concept as\n\u201cthe servant-leader is servant-first, an attitude that flows from a deep-rooted, natural\ninclination to serve [followers]\u201d at work (Fry et al., 2007, p.6), the interviewer asked\nthe informants whether this concept has the same meaning in China or if there is an\nalternative term in the Chinese language that closely relates to this concept.\nThe first author (a native Chinese) interviewed each of the participants individually.\nThe results showed that all informants contended that the concept of servant\nleadership has the same meaning in China. Furthermore, this study found that the\nChinese concept of servant leadership may be precisely described as public servant\nleadership in the public sector, whilst servant leadership in non-public sector.\nMain Study\nSamples and Procedures\nIn the Chinese context, public sector organizations refer to \u201ccentral governmental\nagencies, state, county, municipal, and township governmental units, and\n15\nquasi-governmental enterprises\u201d(Lan et al., 2009). The sample for the main study\nconsisted of 99 informants from 34 different organizations (see Figure 1) in the same\nnew economically booming city in South China as in pilot survey.\n-------------------------------\nFigure 1 about here\n------------------------------\nThis study used an open-ended questionnaire survey as our data collection method, but\nthis time based on a critical incident technique. We asked the participants to describe\none or more concrete events that they viewed as servant leadership in their work\nexperience, in line with Flanagan\u2019s (1954) critical incident technique. Flanagan defines\na critical incident as any observable human activity that is \u201csufficiently complete in\nitself to permit inferences and prediction to be made about the person performing the\nact\u201d (Flanagan, 1954, p. 327). We justify this method as follows. Compared with\ninterviews or focus groups or observations (typical qualitative methods), open-ended\nquestionnaire surveys may \u201coffer greater anonymity to respondents and often elicit\nmore honest responses\u201d. They may \u201ccapture diversity in responses and provide\nalternative explanations to those that closed-ended survey questions are able to\ncapture\u201d (Jackson and Trochim, 2002, p.307). They \u201cforce respondents to express\nthemselves more concisely while at the same time giving them opportunity to vent or\nexplain themselves in a shorter narrative form.\u201d Answers may \u201cvary from a few phrases\nto a couple of paragraphs and represent a wide variety of concepts with varying\nfrequency and detail a \u2018free list in context type of text\u201d (Jackson and Trochim, 2002,\n16\np.308). In a Chinese organizational research context, this paper considers this approach\nmore appropriate than drawing on other qualitative data collection methods such as\ninterview and observation due to the cultural-social-political context of contemporary\nChina, whereby identifying the respondents for interview or the lack of external\nbehavioral clues for observation may jeopardize the collection of the high quality data.\nOf course, this approach may yield incomplete answers and raise concerns on the issue\nof the reliability of coding decisions, but no methodology is immune from deficiencies.\nWe predicate this approach on the precedence set by a number of key scholars in their\nstudies of China: Farh, Zhong and Organ, 2004 (organizational citizenship behavior);\nTsui, Wang and Xin, 2006 (organizational culture); and Liu, Spector and Jex, 2006 (job\nstrain). We asked the respondents,, \u201cAccording to your past experience and knowledge,\nplease give example(s) of public servant leadership at work..\u201d To avoid potentially\nbiasing their responses, the researchers did not provide the respondents with examples.\nThe first researcher conducted all of the interviews. Altogether, 99 participants\nprovided a response rate of 80 %. This is a higher than normal response rate for an\norganization-based survey in social sciences (Baruch, 1999). Table 2 indicates, the\npercentage of respondents\u2019 gender, age, and educational qualifications. Among the\nrespondents, 68% were male and 26% were female. The predominant age group was\n31-40 years (ranging from 33 to 56 years old).\n17\n-------------------------------\nTable 2 about here\n------------------------------\nThe first researcher (a native Chinese) assessed all critical incidents on two criteria: a)\nthe answer must have a clear meaning in the Chinese language; and b) the answer\nmust refer to leadership incidents. The researcher rejected any ambiguous or difficult\nto interpret answers. Overall, in 133 collected incidents, 116 were relevant and valid.\nThen, the data, in its Chinese version, was submitted to semiotic cluster analysis (Eco,\n1976; Feldman, 1995). Semiotic clustering is a simple, yet powerful technique that\nallows researchers to uncover successive levels of meaning, from surface signs to the\nunderlying structure (Manning, 1987, Cunha, 2004). In this process, we used the\ndata-driven code development of Thematic Analysis (Boyatzis, 1998) in analyzing our\ndata. This process includes identification of themes and development of codes and\nclusters. We began with \u201creducing the raw information, identifying themes within\nsub-samples, comparing themes across sub-samples, creating a code (book), and\ndetermining the reliability (of the code)\u201d (Boyatzis, 1998, p.44).\nTo test the reliability of the codes (Miles and Huberman, 1994) deduced by the first\nauthor of this paper (Coder 1), a second coder (Coder 2: a native Chinese) labeled the\ndata by adopting the nine categories developed by Coder 1. The two coders compared\n18\nand discussed their results and finally agreed on a common format1. Finally, they\nemployed quasi-statistical methods to transform textual data into quantitative data,\nfocusing upon overall frequencies and descriptive statistics, rather than significance \ntesting (King, 1994).\nResults\nIn our approach to semiotic cluster analysis, we tabulated the qualitative data into\nthree columns. Table 3 presents the semiotic clustering for this study on different\ncategories of servant leadership in the public sector in China. Table 4 describes the\nfrequencies and descriptive statistics in different categories of each type of servant\nleadership.\n-------------------------------\nTable 3 about here\n------------------------------\n-------------------------\nTable 4 about here\n--------------------------\nThe first column in Table 3 refers to signs or denotative meanings. It is often labeled\n\u2018competing meanings\u2019 (Feldman, 1995) or \u2018denotative meanings\u2019 (Strauss and Corbin,\n1 The interrater reliability score between the first researcher and the first data auditor\nfor the nine the competing meaning is 87%, for the connotative meaning is 100% and\nfor the institutional concern is 100%.\n19\n1990) and includes the main ways in which the study participants have approached\nthe target concept (See Table 5 for illustrative examples). In their answers to our\nquestions, the respondents described nine types of leadership as servant leadership in\nthe public sector of China (See first column in Table 3). Table 4 describes the\npercentage of incidents in different categories. Of the 116 incidents, nine competing\nmeanings emerged throughout the content analysis. These are: putting people first\n(32%), being dutiful (19%), ethical behavior (13%), moral (agapao) love (12%),\nleadership (conceptual) skills (11%), humility (4%), building relationship(3%),\ndevotion to Party policies and state laws (3%), and listening (3%) (See Table 4).\n-------------------------------\nTable 5 about here\n------------------------------\nThe second column in Table 3 of our semiotic cluster analysis, \u2018connotative\nmeanings\u2019, shows \u201ca pattern in the denotative meanings and builds new meaning\nthrough some type of association between competing or denotative meanings\u201d (Cuhna,\n2004, p.131). \u201cThere is not a \u2018right\u2019 way of filling in this column since the meanings\nare dependent upon interpretation and emerge from data\u201d (Strauss and Corbin, 1990 in\nCuhna, 2004, p.131). We grouped these into two \u2018connotative meanings\u2019 (See second\ncolumn in Table 3.) i.e. similar group and different group respectively, which suggest\nthe possible similarities and differences between Western and Chinese perceptions on\nservant leadership. The \u2018similar\u2019 group of servant leadership (75% in total) in our\nsemiotic cluster analysis suggested putting people first, ethical behavior, moral\n20\n(agapao) love, leadership (conceptual) skills, humility and building relationships as\ncommon types of servant leadership behavior in China and in the West. However,\nbeing dutiful, complying with Party policies and state laws, and listening fell into the\n\u2018different\u2019 category (25% in total) of connotative meanings in our semiotic cluster\nanalysis. We used the terms of similar and different in describing our servant\nleadership forms for ease of discussion since it is not reasonable to propose that a\nconstruct explored in two highly divergent cultures is unique (Farh et al., 2006). This\npaper describes these in detail in the next section.\nSimilar Servant Leadership Types\nThe most important servant leadership type in China, is putting people first (32% out\nof 116 incidents). This more humane style uses actions and words to clearly indicate\nto others (especially immediate followers) that satisfying their work needs is a priority,\nparticularly in assisting subordinates with problems they are facing with their\nassigned duties (Dennis and Bocarnea, 2005; Dennis and Winston, 2003; Ehrhart,\n2004; Liden et al., 2008, Sendjaya, 2003; 2008)..\nThe second similar servant leadership type is ethical behavior, i.e. interacting openly,\nfairly, and honestly with employees and\/or maintaining consistency between words\nand deeds (Ehrhart, 2004; Liden et al., 2008; Sendjaya, 2003; 2008). This Chinese\n21\ntype of servant leadership includes uncorrupted behavior and requires high levels of\nself-discipline.\nThe third similar servant leadership type is moral (agapao) love, genuinely caring for\nothers, showing sensitivity to others' personal concerns and interest in the lives of\nfollowers (Barbuto and Wheeler, 2000; Dennis and Bocarnea, 2005; Liden et al.,\n2008). Slightly different from the Western servant leadership style, the Chinese\nservant leadership may also call for caring for disadvantaged groups or employees.\nThe fourth similar servant leadership type is conceptual skills, possessing the\nknowledge of the organization and the tasks at hand so as to be in a position to\neffectively support and assist others, especially immediate followers (Ehrhart, 2004;\nLiden et al., 2008). This includes the Western servant leadership type of wisdom, i.e.\nability to seek pathways through challenging concerns, and vision, i.e., a leader\u2019s\nability to anticipate the future and its consequences (Barbuto and Wheeler, 2006).\nNevertheless, it does not include communicating shared vision to subordinates in the\nWestern servant leadership type of wisdom or vision.\n22\nThe fifth servant leadership type is humility i.e., \u201cacting quietly without deliberately\nseeking public attention (Sendjaya, 2003, p.4; 2008, p.407). The Chinese leadership\ntype equivalent does not include showing respect for employees and acknowledging\ntheir contribution to the team (Dennis and Bocarnea, 2005).\nThe final similar servant leadership type is building relationship, the act of making a\ngenuine effort to know, understand, and support others in the organization and outside\nthe organization, with an emphasis on building long-term relationships with those\npeople (Dennis and Bocarnea, 2005; Ehrhart, 2004). The Chinese type of servant\nleadership may have a broader view than the Western one since it also includes\nforming relationships with people outside the organization.\nSpecific Chinese Servant Leadership\nWe also found three types of servant leadership, which may be specific to the Chinese\ncontext including: being dutiful, displaying devotion to Party policies and state laws,\nand listening.\nThe first specific type is being dutiful, which shows that Chinese servant leaders are\ndiligent, reliable and take the initiative at work. The second specific type is devotion\n23\nand displaying devotion to Party policies and state laws, which is consistent with the\nrequirement from the Chinese Communist Party Constitution (1997). The final type is\nlistening, namely leaders\u2019 willingness to hear and value employees\u2019 opinions, ideas,\nand suggestions.\nThe last column in Table 3 of our semiotic cluster analysis involves a leap that is\nsimilar to the one that allows the transposition of data from the first (competing or\ndenotative meanings) to the second column (connotative meanings). This column is\nlabeled \u2018institutional concerns\u2019 and suggests a structure underlying the data which are\nmeaningful servant leadership styles in China\u2019s public sector.\nHowever, the authors did not find the Western perceptions on servant leadership styles\nof creating value for the community (Liden et al., 2008; see also Barbuto and Wheeler,\n2006; Ehrhart, 2004); empowering (Liden et al., 2008; Dennis and Winston, 2003;\nDennis and Bocarnea, 2005; Ehrhart, 2004; Sendjaya, 2003; 2008); persuasive\nmapping (Barbuto and Wheeler, 2006); and transcendent spirituality (Sendjaya, 2003;\n2008) in our study.\nConclusion\nUsing an inductive approach to explore the term and content domain of servant\nleadership in the public sector in China, this study has shown that the concept of\n24\nservant leadership holds comparable meaning in China. Furthermore, this study found\nthat the Chinese concept of servant leadership has similar meaning in both the public\nand non-public sectors, whilst they used different words to describe it. Public servant\nleadership was used to describe servant leadership in public sector, whilst servant\nleadership was applied to non-public sector. This research shows that respondents\ncharacterized Chinese servant leadership in the public sector as such: putting people\nfirst, being dutiful, ethical behavior, moral (agapao) love, leadership (conceptual)\nskills, humility, relationship building, compliance with Party policies and state laws,\nand listening.\nOverall, our study suggests that components of Confucianism, Daoism and\nCommunist ideology influence the development and formulation of Chinese servant\nleadership. Our findings on the similar types of servant leadership between China and\nthe West raise the following questions. First, why does Chinese servant leadership\ninclude uncorrupted and \/or self-disciplined behavior as behaving ethically? We\nconsider this to be the result of the Chinese educational systems\u2019 promotion of the\nChinese Communist Party Constitution (1997) summarized by Fu and Tsui (2003,\np.427), including resistance against corruption and abidance of Party policies and\nstate laws. Second, why does Chinese servant leadership of moral (agapao) love\ninclude caring for the disadvantaged group or employees? This type of behavior may\nbroadly include assistance for disadvantaged employees, such as the laid-off, the sick,\nand the retiree, as well as assistance for employees with personal difficulties. This\n25\nindicates the Chinese leadership style of renqing\u2014benevolence and righteousness in\nthe findings from Fu and Tsui (2003).\nThird, do Chinese leaders need to communicate shared vision to subordinates as\nrevealed by servant leadership of wisdom or vision (Barbuto and Wheeler, 2006;\nDennis and Bocarnea, 2005; Dennis and Winston, 2003; Sendjaya, 2003; 2008)? We\nsuggest the following possible interpretation: communicating shared vision to\nsubordinates is part of a leader\u2019s daily work, otherwise they would not easily achieve\norganizational missions and goals. Finally, do Chinese leaders need to show respect\nfor employees and acknowledge their contribution to the team through adopting a\nhumility servant leadership style (Dennis and Bocarnea, 2005, p.603)? The extant\nliterature has shown that in terms of supervisor-subordinate guanxi, Chinese leaders\ndo need to show respect towards employees and acknowledge their contribution to the\nteam (Han and Altman, 2009). However, in Han and Altman\u2019s (2008) study, these\ntypes of behavior are identified as recognition of subordinates a phenomenon viewed\nas distinctly Chinese and not an aspect of servant leadership.\nTurning our attention to specific forms of Chinese servant leadership, we view being\ndutiful as an extended Chinese form of servant leadership. Duty is often regarded as a\nconservative and perhaps even an outdated concept. The organizational behaviour\n26\nliterature rarely mentions the concept of duty\/devotion, yet changes in the social and\norganizational environments have made a sense of duty ever more necessary. We\noften equate duty with obligation, but in fact much of this behavior is volitional.\nWhen organizational dysfunctions appear, important tasks may be left undone, and\nunexpected problems may arise for which there is no standardized solution. Hence,\norganizations need people, particularly leaders who, through their discretionary action,\nensure that their team, department or organization continue to function not only\nefficiently, but as one organic whole.\nFurthermore, listening may be a so-called type of Chinese servant leadership since\nWestern scholars mention this type of behavior, but do not fully explore its meaning\nwithin the Chinese context (Barbuto and Wheeler, 2006; Spears, 1995). Finally,\ndevotion to Party policies and state laws is a requirement of the Chinese Communist\nParty Constitution (1997), and is a uniquely salient influence on Chinese leaders,\nparticularly in the public sector.\nLimitations, Future Research Directions and Managerial Suggestions\nAlthough this study covers a spectrum of contemporary public sector Chinese\norganizations, our sample is not representative of all Chinese organizations in the\npubic sector. Our analysis does not preclude different interpretations in other settings\nsince this research does not cover entire meanings of servant leadership in Chinese\nsocieties. Another limitation of this research is that since we asked for perceptions on\n27\nservant leadership, more than 85% of respondents provided illustrations by proxy in\nreference to others or abstract incidents in the organization rather than servant\nleadership between themselves and their supervisors. Because of this, the authors\nwere unable to compare dyadic leadership between managerial civil servants and\nnon-managerial civil servants and precisely compare servant leadership perceptions\nacross gender. This calls for further research. Future research may also explore what\nsociety may construe as servant leadership in business settings and compare and\ncontrast such perceptional differences with people from the public sector.\nIn terms of implication for practice, this paper proposes the following: putting people\nfirst, being dutiful, ethical behavour, moral (agapao) love, leadership (conceptual)\nskills, humility, building relationship, devotion to Party policies and state laws, and\nlistening are the ways which managers attract, retain and motivate their employees in\nthe public sector in China. The concept of servant leadership in the PRC is to draw,\nkeep and motivate high performance employees and that in order to restore\nemployee\u2019s trust, commitment and confidence in management, servant leadership is a\npowerful philosophy and practice towards achieving such a goal.\n28\nTable 1 Various Dimensions and Definitions of Servant Leadership\nin the Western Literature\nDimensions Definition\nAgapao (i.e. love) genuinely caring for others, showing sensitivity to others'\npersonal concerns and interest in the lives of\nfollowers (Dennis and Bocarnea, 2005;
