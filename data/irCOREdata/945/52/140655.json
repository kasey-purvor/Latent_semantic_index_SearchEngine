Introduction \nIn a time of fast growing technology and \ncommunication systems, it is important for industry \nand organisations to develop new customer contact \ncentre (CCC) environment technologies for better \ncustomer satisfaction. There are three features of \ncontact centre operations that customers feel are crucial \nto quality service, namely convenience in fast call \nhandling, cordiality of the advisor, and consistency in \nadvisors providing a reliable and accurate service [1]. \nIt is critical for companies to identify the need to offer \na superior service in order to ensure business survival \nin a service sector economy [2]. Customer contact \ncentres afford the companies the potential to manage \ncustomer relations more effectively, thus providing \nsome competitive advantage while saving costs [3]. \nCustomer satisfaction may in addition be based on \nanother three dimensions: access, including the \nadvisors communication skills; timeliness, including \nadvisors resolution of queries; and quality, which \nincludes the accuracy, consistency and \ncomprehensiveness of the advisors advice, in addition \nto the knowledge and politeness of the advisors. Thus \nthe role of the advisors, assumes a heightened \nimportance in customer satisfaction [4]. Within the \ncurrent contact centre environment there is a problem \nof high staff turnover and lack of trained staff at the \nright place for the right kind of customer. Business \nneeds to assign any available advisor to a customer and \nprovide consistent and good quality of service. There is \na need to identify the right amount of information to be \ndisplayed on the screen considering both the customer \nand the assigned advisor background.\n2. Related Research \nResearch in understanding customer preferences, \nknown as \u2018consumer behaviour study\u2019, has been the \nsubject of investigation in psychological marketing \narea for few decades. Understanding and adapting to \nchanges of customer behaviour is an important aspect \nof surviving in a continuously changing environment \n[6]. Customer choice of a product depends on explicit \nrequirements, implicit requirements, available options \nand latent requirements implied by the product [7]. \nThe performance of a CSA during interactions with \ncustomers has been the subject of considerable \nresearch, in both sales and service settings [8]. \nResearch has suggested that advisors (CSA\u2019s) \nperformance is critical to create customer satisfaction, \nlittle has been done to analyse which employee \nbehaviour influence customer encounter satisfaction \nand which behaviour influence relationship \nsatisfaction. Previous studies also suggest that \nattitudinal and behavioural responses of advisors are \nimportant because of the interactive nature of service \ndelivery. It also showed that advisors attitudinal and \nbehavioural responses can positively and negatively \naffect customer\u2019s perceptions of the service encounter \nand their judgments of service quality [9]. Trust has a \nmoderate but beneficial influence on the development \nProceedings of the 2005 International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Modelling, Control and Automation, and International Conference on \nIntelligent Agents, Web Technologies and Internet Commerce (CIMCA-IAWTIC\u201905) \n0-7695-2504-0\/05 $20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE \nof positive customer attitudes, intentions, and \nbehaviour. Advisors (CSA) have modest influence \nover the development of trust between themselves and \ntheir customer [9]. Customer attitude is influenced by \nbelief about brand equity (value), which is affected by \nthe content, context and infrastructure. Customer \nloyalty is determined by attitude and belief about the \ncontext in which the products or services are offered \n[10]. Modeling the users can include statements of \nhow the users within a specific user group behave in \ncertain situations or perform certain functions [11]. \nEmotional reactions to a sales interaction may affect \nconsumer satisfaction with the purchase experience \nand future purchase intentions (cross \u2013 up sell \nopportunities) [12].  \nSoft computing differs from hard (conventional) \ncomputing in that it is tolerant of imprecision, \nuncertainty and partial truth [13]. Soft computing \ntechnologies provide an approximate solution to an ill \ndefined problem and can create user models in an \nenvironment such as contact centre to identify: (a) \ncustomer willingness to buy (b) companies prediction \ntowards customer purchase intentions (c) advisor \nreaction towards customer attitude and (d) customer \nbehaviour towards advisors communication [14]. \n3. Current Practice \nFor the purpose of this research, the authors \norganised visits to three different customer contact \ncentres (CCC) and interviewed 20 advisors and 6 team \nleaders. The data and information collected from these \ncentres were captured, understood and were combined \nwith the current information obtained from the literature \nreview and, they were used to identify the categorisation \nfor customer and advisor. The main objectives were:  \n\u0083 Identify the current understanding of the \ncustomer contact centre environment, its overall \noperation and working. \n\u0083 Identify the current bottlenecks in the business \nprocess.  \n\u0083 Identify the use of different customer \u2013 advisor \ncharacterisation procedures. \n3.1. Key Observations and Findings \nThe primary key targets for the centres noticed by \nthe authors were mainly the RAP time which is the \ntime the advisor spent other than on calls. Call times \ntakes up about 2 minutes to 12 minutes. Call Handling \nTime is the effective time; the advisor spends on calls \nwith the customers. The findings showed that there \nwas a high turn over of CSA and it was necessary to \nallocate the first available advisor to the customer and \nthen provide the advisor with relevant information. \nThe technical issues encountered during the visits to \nthe centres are as discussed below in table (1). \nTable1.

Cranfield Approach \u2013 Research      \n    Methodology \nThrough the proposed methodology for \ncategorisation of customer and advisor, the authors \nhave demonstrated a way which can help to identify \nthe right amount of information which can enable the \nadvisor to deal with the customer more efficiently and \nthus providing better customer satisfaction. The main \nsections which are discussed here for the development \nof the information requirement methodology are: \n1.

Flowchart for the proposed \nmethodology \nAS-IS study was done at five of the customer contact \ncentres to identify the current trends in customer \ncontact and the need to identify the right amount of \ninformation considering both the customer and \nassigned advisor background. Data was collected with \nsemi structured questionnaire for advisors and team \nleaders at contact centres. Proper methodology was \nfollowed for the development of fuzzy expert system \nfor the assignment of category to the advisor and \ncustomer. Experimental results were carried out within \nthe model to identify the type of category assigned to \neach customer and advisor which was validated with \nthe experts.  For full explanation of the development \nof the methodology refer to reference [16].  \nFor information requirement analysis; possible \ncombinations of {customer, advisor} scenarios were \nderived. Based on these possible scenarios, the \nminimum amount of information required to be \ndisplayed was derived. The team leaders and \nmanagers were thus given the option of all the \npossible combinations of the customer and advisors, \nand asked to identify information which would help \nthe advisor to serve the customer. Further design and \ndevelopment of the information required framework is \ndiscussed in section 4.4. Validation of information \nrequirement framework was done through expert \njudgments from team leaders and discussed in section \n5. \n4.1. Data Collection \nData was collected with the help of semi-\nstructured questionnaires for advisors (CSA) and team \nleaders\/managers with respect to their demographic \nvariables, experience and behavioural variables within \nfive customer contact centre focusing on fault and \nsales and looking on single to multi profile business \ncustomers. A total of 84 advisors were interviewed \nand assessed, 60 customer calls were monitored, and \ntotal of 19 team leaders and managers were \ninterviewed through the questionnaires. The key \nobservations which the authors noticed for the data \ncollection were advisors characteristics and customer \nmonitoring (voice). Please refer to reference [16] for \nfull list of the criteria\u2019s used for customer and advisor \ndata collection. The customer data collection was done \non the basis of the information provided on the screen \nof the advisor when the call conversation was in \nprogress. Based on the data collection and analysis of \ndata; attributes derived for customer and advisor are as \nfollows: \n\u0083 Customer \u2013 age, education, financial status, \ntime with company, business value and \nbehavioural analysis.  \n\u0083 Advisor \u2013 age, education, experience, previous \nexperience, IT speed, and behavioural analysis.  \nThrough the data analysis tool, the customers and \nadvisor were then grouped according to the attributes \nshared among each other.  \n4.2. Clustering Analysis \u2013 Identification of    \n Customer and Advisor Categorisation \nThis section shows the method followed for \nidentification of customer and advisor categorisation \nthrough clustering analysis by using two \u2013 step \nprocess within SPSS analysis. The final set of \nattributes used for customer and advisor (CSA) for the \nclustering analysis to derive the categories are as \nshown in table (2). Six advisor categories (A1-A6) \nwere derived out of the 84 data sets for the advisors. \nBased on the clustering few results were noted which \nwere: \n1. Because the number of clusters increased from \n6-10, the total number of cases each cluster is \ntaking is not properly distributed. \n2. The rules derived from the cluster results are \nrepeated and are too close to each other. \nProceedings of the 2005 International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Modelling, Control and Automation, and International Conference on \nIntelligent Agents, Web Technologies and Internet Commerce (CIMCA-IAWTIC\u201905) \n0-7695-2504-0\/05 $20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE \nTABLE 2. \nADVISOR AND CUSTOMER ANALYSIS [16] \n4.3. Development of Fuzzy Expert System \nThis section discusses the steps followed for the \ndevelopment of the fuzzy expert system to assign any \ncustomer and advisor to that of pre-defined category \nwhich was derived from the clustering analysis. \nStep 1 \u2013 Identify the critical factors and define \nmembership functions and fuzzy sets. \nThe critical factors were the input variables of the \nfuzzy ES which were as age, gender, and education, \nand financial background, time with the company, \nbusiness value and behaviour from the customer side \nwhich would identify the type of category they belong \nto. Triangular and trapezoidal types of membership \nfunction are selected to define the variables (figure 2). \nStep 2 \u2013 Construct the Fuzzy Rules \nWithin the fuzzy expert system model once the \nmembership functions for customers and advisors \nwere derived, fuzzy if\u2026then rule were written which \nidentified the type of input for customers and advisors. \nThe rule base specifies qualitatively how the output of \nthe system \u201cCategory\u201d for the advisor and the \ncustomer is determined for the input variables of Age, \nEducation, Financial Status, and Time with Company, \nBusiness Value, and Experience. A total of twenty \nrules were derived within the expert system. For \nadvisor rules; IF age is young, education is school, \nexperience is novice, previous exp is low, IT speed is \nslow, positive behaviour as friendly and negative \nbehaviour as unaware THEN the selected category is \nA1. \nFor customer rules; IF age is young, education is \nschool, financial status is poor, time with company is \nlow, business value is low, positive behaviour is none \nand negative behaviour is aggressive THEN the \ncategory selected is C1. \n4.4. Information Requirement Analysis \nInformation requirement analysis was done on the \nbasis of the set of categories for customer and advisor \nderived from the clustering and determined from the \nfuzzy expert system model. The main objective was to \nidentify the minimum amount of information which is \nrequired to be displayed on the screen to the advisor \nwhich would enable the advisor to help the customer. \nThis information should always satisfy the three \nimportant business aspects of customer contact which \nwere (i) Customer Satisfaction, (2) Resolving the \nconflict and (3) Cross Sell \u2013 Up Sell opportunities. \nInformation Requirement framework was developed \nto overcome the information overload with the current \ncontact centre environment. Also from the point of \ncustomer satisfaction speed of response was crucial \nand the right amount of information which is required \nto be displayed to the advisor under particular \ncustomer \u2013 advisor situation was important. \nAdvisors (CSA) \n1.

Conceptual Contact Centre Model \nFrom the initial understanding of the contact centre, \nand from the literature studies; the author designed a \ntemplate with the complete list of information which \nwould be used during a particular customer-advisor \nconversation. This list is mainly divided into three \nsections with customer information, business service \ndetails and advisor details (figure 4). Once the total \ninformation to be displayed was known, it was \nvalidated with the industry experts of six team leaders \nand three advisors within the centre. \n5. Validation \nThe information and the results from the model \nwere verified through team leaders and managers at \nthree of the contact centres. A total of nine team \nleaders and managers were interviewed with the help \nof an open set questionnaire, showing the categories \nderived and the assignment of a particular customer or \nadvisor to these categories through the help of the \nfuzzy expert system tool developed. From the \nvalidation, it was noticed that the expert judgment did \ncorrespond to that of the results from the expert system \nmodel framework for 80% of the overall experiments \nthat were carried out. A total of thirty six scenarios \nwere considered identifying the best case and worst \ncase of customer and advisor contact. The scenario \nidentifies the type of customer and advisor and selects \nthe required information based on the customer and \nadvisor attributes from the categorisation [16]. \nExample 1.

Discussion and Future Research \nThe authors have demonstrated the steps which \nwere followed to identify the information requirement \nanalysis for the advisor within contact centre \nenvironment.  The need to identify the right amount of \ninformation to be displayed on the screen for both \ncustomer and the assigned advisor background led to \nthe development of the research framework.  \nExperimental results were carried out which showed \nthat 80% of time the model was assigning a particular \ncustomer and advisor to the [16]. The cost and \nmaintenance analysis of the framework would be \nconsidered for future research and will form the part of \nthe continuing research carried out within the project. \nFurther validation of the framework will be carried out \nwith simulation techniques.  \nAdvisor Details \nCompany Value \nNew Products \nLast Advisor Details \nAccount Update \nChange of Services \nProduct Update \nCustomer \nInformation \nCustomer ID Details \nType of Customer \nAddress Details \nDemographic Data \nBusiness Details \nType of Service \nTime with Company \nPrevious Transactions \nBehavioural Changes \nFinancial Status \nBuying Power \nComplaint Details \nFigure 4.

Conclusions \nThis paper is focused on the research and \ndevelopment of methodology to identify the right \namount of information to be displayed on the screen. \nFour main approaches were followed for the \ndevelopment of the information requirement \nmethodology. The AS-IS study was carried out to \nstudy and identify the industrial context and the need \nof the framework. The authors identified the initial \nattributes through five case studies carried out at the \ncustomer contact centres within UK ranging from \ntelecoms to help desk and government with 84 \ncustomer advisor and 60 customers\u2019 data points. Based \non the initial clustering results, the authors then derived \nthe initial categorisation for customers and advisors. \nDevelopment of fuzzy expert system was carried out to \nassign any customer or advisor to that of the pre-\ndetermined category from the clustering analysis. The \nfuzzy expert system was validated with the experts \nfrom CC with experimental results showing the \nassignment of the categories to customer and advisors. \nInformation requirement framework was validated with \nnine team leaders and advisors at the contact centres.  \n8.
