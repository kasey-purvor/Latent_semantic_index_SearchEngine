Boldness 29 \nwas determined in individual fish over two trials by measuring the latency to approach a 30 \nnovel object. Differences in plasma cortisol concentrations and the expression of eight novel 31 \ncandidate genes previously identified as being linked with divergent behaviours or stress 32 \nwere determined. Bold and shy individuals, approaching the object within 180 s or not 33 \napproaching within 300 s respectively, were evident within each line, and this was linked 34 \nwith activity levels in the HR line. Post-stress plasma cortisol concentrations were 35 \nsignificantly greater in the HR line compared with the LR line, and six of the eight tested 36 \ngenes were upregulated in the brains of LR fish compared with HR fish. However, no direct 37 \nrelationship between boldness and either stress responsiveness or gene expression was found, 38 \nalthough clear differences in stress physiology and, for the first time, gene expression could 39 \nbe identified between the lines. This lack of correlation between physiological and molecular 40 \nresponses and behavioural variation within both lines highlights the complexity of the 41 \nbehavioural-physiological complex.  42 \n 43 \nKeywords: boldness; cortisol; HPI axis; novel object; Oncorhynchus mykiss; qRT-PCR; 44 \nstress coping styles. 45 \n46 \n3 \n \nIntroduction 47 \nBehavioural polymorphisms are a common feature of natural populations (Sih et al., 2004).  48 \nIn some cases intraspecific variation in behaviour may be inherently necessary due to 49 \nenvironmental changes, often corresponding with ontogenetic shifts (Slater, 1981). However, 50 \nfor many complex behaviours the full adaptive significance of such variation is not fully 51 \nunderstood. Despite this, recent studies have highlighted the underlying role of physiological 52 \nand genetic factors in driving divergent behaviour, particularly differences in animal 53 \npersonality (Bell, 2007; Koolhaas et al., 1999; Korsten et al. 2010; \u00d8verli et al., 2005). One 54 \nfundamental personality trait is boldness. An individual\u2019s boldness is defined by its response 55 \nto a novel challenge, with these responses regarded as an indicator of the amount of risk an 56 \nanimal is prepared to take in new circumstances (Koolhaas et al., 1999; Sih et al., 2004; 57 \nSneddon, 2003, van Oers et al., 2005).  As such, boldness can directly influence an 58 \norganism\u2019s fitness, with costs or benefits dependent upon the environmental context (Brown 59 \net al., 2007). 60 \n 61 \nBoldness is not a discrete trait, but rather represents a continuous range of behavioural 62 \nprofiles from bold to shy (Cockrem, 2007). This bold\/shy continuum describes a suite of 63 \ncorrelated behaviours which are often considered consistent between contexts. In general, shy 64 \nanimals are more reclusive or unresponsive when faced with an unfamiliar situation, whilst 65 \nbold organisms will act normally or even actively investigate novel environments or objects 66 \nmore readily under the same conditions (Beausoleil et al., 2008; Carere and van Oers, 2004; 67 \nFrost et al., 2007; Verbeek et al., 1994; Wilson et al., 1993; Yoshida et al., 2005). Bold 68 \nanimals are also relatively more aggressive, spend more time in the open, recover more 69 \nquickly (e.g. from fear stimulation) and are able to learn more quickly than shy animals 70 \n4 \n \n(Carere et al., 2005; Magnhagen, 2007; Sneddon, 2003; van Oers et al., 2005; Verbeek et al., 71 \n1996).  72 \n 73 \nBehavioural profiles within a species have also been linked with the physiological response 74 \nto a stressor, collectively comprising the individual\u2019s \u2018coping style\u2019 (Koolhaas et al., 1999). 75 \nStressors are defined as challenges to an individual\u2019s homeostasis that result in a stress 76 \nresponse: behavioural and neuroendocrine reactions that address the negative effects of that 77 \nchallenge (Wendelaar Bonga, 1997). Intraspecific differences in stress responsiveness reflect 78 \nvariation in the control of hormone release within the neuroendocrine stress axis. 79 \nConsequently, the proactive (active) coping style, typified by aggression and territoriality, is 80 \ncharacterised by high adrenergic (noradrenaline) axis activity and low hypothalamo-pituitary-81 \nadrenal\/interrenal (HPA\/HPI) axis activity. In contrast, reactive (passive) behaviour, 82 \ncharacterised by withdrawal and immobility, is linked with a higher HPI response (De Boer 83 \net al., 1990). These dichotomous behavioural strategies associated with coping style are often, 84 \nthough not always, correlated with boldness (e.g. Koolhaas et al., 1999; \u00d8verli et al., 2007).  85 \n 86 \nBehavioural characteristics have a significant genetic component in many natural populations 87 \nin several taxa (e.g. \u00c1lvarez and Bell, 2007; Benus et al., 1991; Fidler et al., 2007; Giles and 88 \nHuntingford, 1984; Korsten et al., 2010; van Oers et al., 2004).  Similarly, the physiological 89 \nresponse to stress also appears to have a substantial underlying genetic basis.  For example, it 90 \nwas possible to select two lines of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, for divergent 91 \nendocrine response to a confinement stressor; across four generations, post-stress plasma 92 \ncortisol concentrations remained significantly greater in high (HR) compared with low (LR) 93 \nstress responding lines, with a moderate to high heritability (h\n2\n=0.41\u20130.73) for HPI-reactivity 94 \nto stress (Pottinger and Carrick, 1999; Pottinger and Carrick, 2001a). Interestingly, these lines 95 \n5 \n \nalso exhibit divergent behavioural traits which are linked with boldness: LR fish, whose 96 \nbehaviour shares characteristics with a bold phenotype, display longer retention of a 97 \nclassically conditioned response than HR fish which are considered to be relatively shy. LR 98 \nfish also exhibit proactive behaviours such as enhanced aggression, social dominance, and 99 \nrapid resumption of feed intake after exposure to a stressor (\u00d8verli et al., 2007). These trout 100 \nlines thus provide an excellent model to study coping style and the concomitant relationship 101 \nbetween heritable stress responses and behavioural phenotype which is, furthermore, 102 \nreflected in natural populations (Cockrem, 2007; Koolhaas et al., 1999). 103 \n 104 \nUltimately, many of these heritable differences in behaviour are manifest as differences in 105 \ngene expression: a microarray analysis comparing the expression of 20,000 genes in an 106 \noutbred population of O. mykiss highlighted ~1,000 genes which were differentially 107 \nexpressed in the brains of fish showing either consistently bold or shy responses to novelty 108 \n(Sneddon et al., MS under review). Therefore differential gene regulation between bold and 109 \nshy fish indicate that bold fish have either a different transcriptomic profile or more 110 \nprofoundly regulate relevant genes, and may also account for divergence of behaviour or 111 \nstress physiology in these animals. If the genes identified by Sneddon and co-workers 112 \n(Sneddon et al. 2005; Sneddon et al., MS under review) play a role in defining bold and shy 113 \nphenotypes, they might be expected to show a different pattern of expression between HR 114 \nand LR fish. With the exception of a study by Schjolden et al. (2005) there has been little 115 \nexamination of bold\/shy behaviour within these lines of rainbow trout, nor has the possibility 116 \nthat behavioural variation between these lines of selected fish may be linked to discrete 117 \nindividual differences in brain gene expression been explored. These lines thus offer a unique 118 \nopportunity to investigate the putative link between behavioural polymorphism and 119 \nphysiological stress responsiveness. Furthermore these aspects of animal personality and 120 \n6 \n \ncoping style can, for the first time, be correlated by quantification of the expression of a suite 121 \nof candidate genes.   122 \n 123 \nThe broad aim of this study was to determine the extent to which neuroendocrine responses 124 \nto stress, within trout selectively bred for divergent responses, correlated with bold or shy 125 \nbehavioural traits; we quantified this not only between the HR and LR lines but also 126 \ncharacterised whether individual variation occurred within these lines. Further to this, the 127 \nexpression of a range of novel candidate genes in the brain was determined. We hypothesised 128 \n(1) that LR individuals would exhibit behaviour typical of a bold phenotype and would 129 \napproach a novel object more quickly and exhibit a lower stress response than HR individuals 130 \nwhose behaviour would resemble that of a shy phenotype, and (2) that this divergence in 131 \nbehavioural and endocrine responses would be associated with clear differences in the 132 \nexpression of genes associated with boldness (within lines) and\/or the stress response 133 \n(between lines).  134 \n 135 \nMaterials and Methods 136 \nExperimental fish 137 \nThe following experiment was conducted humanely under Home Office, UK, guidelines 138 \naccording to the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and following local ethical 139 \napproval. Rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum, from inbred lines selected for high 140 \n(HR) or low (LR) cortisol responsiveness to a standardised stressor (Pottinger and Carrick, 141 \n1999) were transferred from CEH Windermere to Liverpool where each line was held 142 \nseparately (~140 fish per tank) in two stock tanks (2x2x0.5 m) in a semi-recirculating system. 143 \nTanks were supplied with filtered aerated freshwater and maintained at 13\u00b12\no\nC on an 144 \nambient 14:10 h light:dark regime. Half of the tank had an opaque overhead cover for shelter. 145 \n7 \n \nFish were inspected twice daily and fed commercial pellets (Skretting, UK) at 1 % body 146 \nweight per day. After a period of at least 4 months to allow fish to acclimate, trout (HR: 147 \nn=44, 343.0\u00b114.7 g; LR: n=33, 356.5\u00b111.0 g) were selected at random from the stock tanks 148 \nand placed into individual glass tanks (90x50x45 cm) which were screened from visual 149 \ndisturbance. All tanks were supplied with a constant flow of filtered freshwater in a semi-150 \nopen system maintained at 10\u00b11\no\nC with aeration. The trout were left to acclimate for a 151 \nminimum of one week and fed daily. Experiments were conducted on fish that had resumed 152 \nfeeding after this period. 153 \n 154 \nBehaviour 155 \nA custom-built low-light video camera was situated in front of the tank and a second camera 156 \nplaced to the side of the tank. Measuring rulers (0.5 cm intervals) were arranged horizontally 157 \nand vertically along the front of the tank to measure proximity of the fish to the novel object. 158 \nThe fish were allowed 10 minutes to acclimatise to the potential disturbance arising from 159 \nsetting up the cameras. Behaviour of the fish without disturbance was then recorded for 10 160 \nminutes, before a novel object was added. The novel object test is a standard paradigm to 161 \ndifferentiate between bold and shy individuals (Wilson et al., 1993). The novel object was 162 \nplaced as near to the centre of the tank as possible, and the behaviour of the fish was recorded 163 \nfor a further 10 minutes after which the object was carefully removed. This test was repeated 164 \na week later to assess the level of consistency of behaviour displayed by the experimental 165 \nindividuals. Novel objects were varied between trials to ensure the fish did not become 166 \nhabituated to a familiar shape, and included an orange frustum-shaped bung (7.05 cm mean 167 \ndiameter, 4.9 cm height) and a bipyramidal Duplo\n(R)\n construct (height 13.5 cm, and 168 \nmaximum widths 7.6x6.3 cm) of black, red and blue bricks.  169 \n 170 \n8 \n \nScoring of the behaviour was accomplished using custom designed behavioural analysis 171 \nsoftware. Three measurements each of three separate behaviours were initially scored based 172 \non the activity levels of the subject and its proximity to the novel object (Table 1; see Frost et 173 \nal., 2007). Principal components analysis (Minitab ver.15.1) was subsequently used to 174 \nidentify the key behaviours that differentiated bold fish from shy. Latency to approach within 175 \n5 cm (s) of the object was strongly represented in the first principle component 176 \n(eigenvalue=3.53, loading for 5 cm latency=-0.41) and could be solely used to differentiate 177 \nbetween bold and shy groups. This measure has previously been used to identify boldness in 178 \nfish (Coleman and Wilson, 1998; Frost et al., 2007). Loadings for six of the measurements 179 \nwere well represented in the first principal component, and two of these, frequency of 180 \nentering a 10 cm zone (min\n-1\n) centred on the object (loading=0.459) and duration (s) spent 181 \npassive (loading=-0.381), were selected for further analysis. Passive behaviour was defined to 182 \nexclude swimming (movement of the fish generated by propulsion using the fins, of no less 183 \nthan approximately one body length) but include drifting, fish pivoting on their own axis, any 184 \nminor movements made to maintain position, and resting on the bottom of the tank. 185 \n 186 \nHormone analysis and quantification of gene expression 187 \nSubsequent to, and on the same day as, the final behavioural trial, approximately half of the 188 \nfish (n=34) were netted and exposed to air for 60 s to induce an acute physiological stress 189 \nresponse before being placed back into their tank (Pickering and Pottinger, 1989). Fifteen 190 \nminutes after emersion, the trout were netted again before being killed humanely by 191 \nconcussion. To obtain unstressed plasma cortisol concentrations, fish were killed by 192 \nconcussion without this treatment. Individuals were killed at the same time each day to 193 \nensure that interpretation of differences in hormone levels was not compromised by diel 194 \nfluctuations in plasma cortisol (Pickering and Pottinger, 1983). Immediately after euthanasia, 195 \n9 \n \na 2 ml blood sample was taken from the caudal vessels using sterile 25 g needles and 196 \nheparinised 2ml syringes. The supernatant plasma was aspirated, divided into aliquots and 197 \nfrozen at -20\no\nC. Plasma cortisol levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (Pottinger and 198 \nCarrick, 2001a).  199 \n 200 \nImmediately following blood sampling, the whole brain was removed and stored at -80\no\nC 201 \nuntil RNA extraction, and fish were sexed. Total RNA was extracted from trout brain using 202 \nTRIzol\u00ae (Invitrogen Life Science, UK), with RNA eluted into 50 \u00b5l RNase-free water. RNA 203 \nconcentrations were determined by optical density at 260 nm using a NanoDrop ND-1000 204 \nspectrophotometer (LabTech International, UK) system and the quality of the samples 205 \nassessed by 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis. For each sample, approximately 1 \u00b5g of mRNA 206 \nwas reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using random hexamers and SuperScript\u2122 III 207 \nreverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Life Science, UK), following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.  208 \n 209 \nThe candidate genes selected for this study were chosen for their roles in behaviours 210 \nassociated with boldness, such as aggression, anxiety and memory, or for their association or 211 \ndirect involvement with the stress response (Table 2). Furthermore, six of these genes, 212 \nependymin, GABAA, calmodulin, MHCI, Hb\u03b14, and a lipocalin, retinol binding protein, were 213 \ndifferentially regulated between bold and shy rainbow trout in a previous study (Sneddon et 214 \nal., 2005; Sneddon et al., MS under review). Eight pairs of primers for these genes were 215 \ndeveloped using Primer Express\u00ae 3.0 software against O. mykiss sequences (Table 3). For 216 \nRT-PCR, ~0.05 \u00b5g of the cDNA was amplified in a 10\u00b5l PCR (using 5 \u00b5l Fast SYBR Green, 217 \nInvitrogen Life Science, UK) primed with 2pmol each primer. Thermal cycling conditions, 218 \nusing a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), were: 10 min at 95\no\nC, 219 \nfollowed by 40X [95\no\nC 3 s, 60\no\nC 30 s] and then [95\no\nC for 15 s, 60\no\nC for 60 s, 95\no\nC for 15 s 220 \n10 \n \nand 60\no\nC for 15 s], which allowed the construction of a melting curve to assess the specificity 221 \nof the product. 222 \n 223 \nData Analysis 224 \nNone of the data were normally distributed (Anderson-Darling; Minitab, ver.15.1) and thus 225 \nnon-parametric tests were applied. These tests also reduce Type 1 errors since there were 226 \nunbalanced sample sizes due to unequal numbers of bold and shy fish in each line. A 227 \nWilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used to analyse the difference between behavioural scores 228 \nof the first and second trial to test for consistency in latency to approach within 5cm of the 229 \nnovel object (Minitab, ver.15.1). Subsequently, data were separated for trout showing 230 \nconsistently bold (approach to 5 cm of the object within 180 s in both trials; n=28) or shy (do 231 \nnot approach to 5 cm within 300 s in both trials; n=13) behaviour. Scores for each of the 232 \nbehaviours were then averaged over the two trials and compared between bold and shy 233 \ngroups within both the HR and LR line using Mann-Whitney U-tests (R, ver.2.7.0), including 234 \nsequential Bonferroni treatment (Rice, 1989) for multiple tests. 235 \n 236 \nPlasma cortisol concentrations for stressed and unstressed trout were compared between the 237 \ntwo stress lines (unstressed: HR n=13, LR n=23; stressed: HR n=27, LR=7), between 238 \nconsistently bold and shy trout (unstressed: bold n=12, shy n=5; stressed: bold n=14, shy 239 \nn=7) and between sexes (female n=17, male n=15) using Mann-Whitney U Tests (R, 240 \nver.2.7.0). For RT-PCR, cycle threshold (Ct; the first cycle number at which fluorescence is 241 \nsignificantly greater than background levels) and efficiency values for each gene were 242 \nexported into REST (ver.2.0.7; Pfaffl et al., 2002) whereby the relative expression of each 243 \ngene between bold and shy fish or between fish from each of the two stress lines, normalised 244 \n11 \n \nto a reference gene (GAPDH), was calculated. Statistical analysis was subsequently 245 \naccomplished through REST\u2019s bootstrap randomisation procedure. 246 \n 247 \nResults 248 \nIn unstressed rainbow trout, (Fig. 1A) plasma cortisol concentrations were significantly 249 \ngreater in LR fish compared with the HR line (3.16 and 1.34 ng ml\n-1\n respectively; W=47.0, 250 \np<0.01, n1n2=23,13), with no significant difference between sexes (W=89.0, p=0.15, 251 \nn1n2=17,15). By contrast, after exposure to a stressor, HR trout had a greater plasma cortisol 252 \nresponse than did LR fish (67.42 ng ml\n-1\n and 27.14 ng ml\n-1\n respectively; W=158.0, p<0.01, 253 \nn1n2=27,7; Fig. 1B), and while blood-cortisol concentrations were higher in female trout 254 \n(73.53 ng ml\n-1\n) than in males (46.36 ng ml\n-1\n), the response was highly variable so 255 \ninsignificant (W=177.0, p=0.06, n1n2=17,15). 256 \n 257 \nConsistent with other studies, boldness showed a bimodal (i.e. u-shaped) distribution and 258 \ntended towards extremes in individual trials both as a group (Fig. 2A) and separated by line 259 \n(Fig. 2B, 2C), with fish exhibiting clear bold (approaching 5 cm of the object within 60 s; 260 \nn=63) or shy (not approach within 5 cm during the trial; n=42) behaviour. Individual trout 261 \nwere consistent in their latency to approach within 5 cm of a novel object over two trials 262 \n(W=913.0, p=0.113, n=77), thus confirming the utility of this measure. Rather than being 263 \nassociated predominantly with one or other line, both bold and shy fish were identified within 264 \neach line. Moreover, there was a tendency for fish to be bold rather than shy in both lines 265 \n(Fig. 3); although there were proportionately more shy fish in the HR line compared to the 266 \nLR line (15:9 bold and shy compared to 13:4 bold and shy respectively), this difference was 267 \nnot significant (\u03c721=0.891, p=0.344). Furthermore, although plasma cortisol concentrations 268 \nprofoundly differed between the two lines, there was no significant difference observed in 269 \n12 \n \ncortisol concentration between bold and shy fish, regardless of whether they were unstressed 270 \n(W=37.0, p=0.51, n1n2=12,5; Fig. 1A) or stressed (W=89.0, p=0.15, n1n2=17,15; Fig. 1B).  271 \n 272 \nAlthough bold and shy fish could be distinguished within each line by their approach latency 273 \nto within 5 cm of a novel object, trends in other behaviours were apparent in HR trout but not 274 \nin LR fish. Within the HR line, consistently bold fish spent less time overall being passive 275 \n(W=244.5, p<0.01, n1n2=15,9; Fig. 4A) than shy trout but this was not true of trout from the 276 \nLR line (W=103.0, p=0.126, n1n2=13,4). Similarly, bold HR trout also entered the 10 cm 277 \nzone about the object more frequently (W=138.0, p<0.01, n1n2=15,9; Fig. 4B) than shy fish, 278 \nbut no significant difference was detected between bold and shy fish in the LR line after 279 \nBonferroni treatment for multiple tests (W=135.0, p=0.048, n1n2=13,4). 280 \n 281 \nDifferences between the stress lines were evident in the relative expression levels of six 282 \ncandidate genes: ependymin, calmodulin, MHCI, GABAA, vasotocin and RBP were 283 \nsignificantly upregulated in the brains of LR fish compared with HR fish (Table 4; Fig. 5B). 284 \nAverage fold change varied from an upregulation factor of 1.89 for AVT up to 5.92 for 285 \nMHCI. In contrast, expression of both POMC and Hb\u03b14 were almost identical between the 286 \nlines. However, bold and shy fish, independent of selection line, did not significantly differ in 287 \nthe expression levels of any of these genes, with the expression of most genes marked by 288 \nlarge variance due to pooling of samples within the stress lines (Fig. 5A).  289 \n 290 \nDiscussion 291 \nBoldness is a complex behavioural trait that has previously been associated with coping style 292 \n(Koolhaas et al., 2007), and may thus be assumed to correlate with the magnitude of the 293 \nphysiological stress response. In this study, bold and shy rainbow trout were identified within 294 \n13 \n \ndistinct stress-response lines of rainbow trout by measuring their behavioural response to 295 \nnovelty: this is the first characterisation of both bold and shy phenotypes within these lines. 296 \nWhilst divergent plasma cortisol responses to a stressor were evident between the HR and LR 297 \nlines, consistent with earlier findings (summarised in \u00d8verli et al., 2005), no significant 298 \nrelationship between boldness and stress responsiveness was found either between or within 299 \nlines. Although a slightly larger proportion of LR trout exhibited a bold phenotype than HR 300 \ntrout this was not significant and no associated differences were observed in post-stress 301 \nplasma cortisol levels between bold and shy individuals independent of selection line. 302 \nSimilarly, physiological divergence between the HR and LR lines was correlated with 303 \ndifferences in regulation of six candidate genes in the brain, but bold and shy fish did not 304 \nexhibit any dissimilarity in the regulation of these candidate genes.  305 \n 306 \nDifferences between HR and LR lines 307 \nThe clear bimodal response to novel objects and the frequency of bold and shy fish within 308 \nline and as a whole were similar to those observed in outbred rainbow trout (Frost et al., 309 \n2007). Boldness thus apears to be bimodally distributed in this species, a response seemingly 310 \nmaintained even in lines selected for divergent responsesiveness to a stressor. Other species 311 \nmay exhibit different distributions, such as a normal distribution with relatively fewer bold 312 \nand shy compared to intermediate fish in pumpkinseed sunfish (Wilson et al., 1993). Thus 313 \nbold\/shy distributions may reflect interspecific or between-population differences in intrinsic 314 \nfactors or extrinsic pressures that may drive variation in personality. Even rearing conditions 315 \ncan cause a prevalence of certain behavioural types within a population of salmonid fish 316 \n(Sundstr\u00f6m et al., 2004).  317 \n 318 \n14 \n \nThe consistent divergence in the HPI reactivity to stress between the two stress lines is in 319 \naccordance with earlier studies on these selected lines using confinement to induce a stress 320 \nresponse (Pottinger and Carrick, 1999; Schjolden et al. 2005). However, the equally strong 321 \ndivergence among some genes involved in the stress response has not previously been 322 \ndemonstrated and emphasises the strong genetic basis that underpins stress physiology in 323 \nrainbow trout (e.g. Pottinger and Carrick, 1999; Pottinger and Carrick, 2001a) and possibly 324 \nother vertebrates (Yao and Denver, 2007). Further work should focus on determining whether 325 \nthese responses are consistent throughout the entire pathway or whether genetic regulation 326 \noccurs only at key loci within the response. In unstressed fish plasma cortisol concentrations 327 \nwere higher in LR fish than in HR fish, the reverse of an earlier observation in these lines 328 \n(Pottinger and Carrick, 2001b), and may reflect factors responsible for modulation of the 329 \nunstimulated HPI axis that have yet to be identified in fish. 330 \n 331 \nDifferences in whole-brain gene expression between the stress lines represent the first 332 \nevidence that the key phenotypic difference between the lines, divergence in stress 333 \nresponsiveness, is reflected in a broader suite of correlated molecular responses linked with 334 \nboldness or stress physiology. Immune function can be compromised by chronic stress 335 \npossibly explaining why MHC, CaM and RBP were each upregulated in LR fish relative to 336 \nHR fish, since the corresponding proteins are associated with the immune system or response. 337 \nThe Ca\n2+\n\/CaM complex directly or indirectly controls a number of mechanisms and enzymes 338 \ninvolved in the immune response, including aspects of the MHC and the serine-threonine 339 \nkinases CaMK I, II and IV (Racioppi and Means, 2008). RBP meanwhile has been implicated 340 \nin inflammatory processes associated with immune responses (Flower, 1996). Low stress-341 \nresponding animals are often characterised as having improved health over those with a high 342 \nresponse, and a major issue associated with sustained elevation of cortisol is a reduction in 343 \n15 \n \nimmunocompetence and increased susceptibility to pathogens (Wendelaar Bonga, 1997). 344 \nSome aspect of divergent immunological parameters between low and high stress responders 345 \nthus appears to be controlled at the molecular level; divergence in gene expression, 346 \nparticularly that of proinflammatory genes, has been identified between stress coping styles 347 \n(MacKenzie et al., 2009) and may reflect differences in circulating steroid concentrations. 348 \n 349 \nBoth GABAA and AVT genes were upregulated in LR fish, and changes in expression of both 350 \ngenes have been related to aggressive behaviour (Backstr\u00f6m and Winberg, 2009; Miczek et 351 \nal., 2003), a defining characteristic of stress coping styles and also of these stress lines, where 352 \nLR trout are more aggressive (Pottinger and Carrick, 2001a). However, high levels of AVT 353 \ntend to inhibit aggression in territorial teleosts such as rainbow trout (Backstr\u00f6m and 354 \nWinberg, 2009), so higher expression of AVT in LR trout is seemingly paradoxical and 355 \nmerits further investigation. Backstr\u00f6m and Winberg (2009) suggest that the aggressive 356 \noutput influenced by AVT could be mediated by other systems, in particular the brain 357 \nserotonergic system, and thus studies that evaluate serotonergic activity together with AVT 358 \nconcentration or expression may throw light on these observations.  359 \n 360 \nExpression of POMC may not differ between subjects with different stress-coping abilities 361 \n(Centeno et al., 2007), but rather physiological variation in the HPI axis may occur 362 \ndownstream during post-translational modification, or via differences in target tissue 363 \nsensitivity, and this may indeed be the case for the HR and LR trout lines.  Concentrations of 364 \nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the blood of HR and LR fish did not differ 365 \nsignificantly during stress; instead, the responsiveness of the interrenal to ACTH differed 366 \nbetween the lines (Pottinger and Carrick, 2001b), and a similar process may operate here. 367 \n 368 \n16 \n \nPhysiology and boldness within the lines 369 \nThe results suggest that the distribution of bold and shy individuals within each line was not 370 \nconsistently influenced by the selection process despite evidence from earlier studies that the 371 \ntwo lines differ consistently in certain key behavioural traits (Pottinger & Carrick, 2001; 372 \n\u00d8verli et al., 2005, 2007). Furthermore, within the HR line the existence of a behavioural 373 \nsyndrome was evident where boldness was significantly linked with activity levels, 374 \nsuggestive of risk-taking and risk-averse strategies in bold and shy fish respectively 375 \n(Sneddon, 2003). Indeed the bold fish in this study were characterised by making more use of 376 \nthe available tank space and making less effort to avoid the object. In contrast, a clear 377 \nbehavioural syndrome was not apparent in the LR line. Behaviour of shyer fish within the LR 378 \nline perhaps was not as well defined compared to natural populations (e.g. Wilson et al., 379 \n1993), which may reflect the generally more bold or proactive coping style exhibited by low 380 \nstress-responding animals (Koolhaas et al., 1999). Alternatively, coping style theory predicts 381 \nthat proactive animals are more rigid in behaviour whereas reactive animals are flexible 382 \n(Koolhaas et al., 1999), which could suggest they are able to draw on a greater pool of 383 \nbehaviours when reacting to environmental stimuli. These LR and HR trout may be 384 \nexhibiting these same trends, where LR animals may simply have a less diverse or more 385 \nlimited behavioural repertoire. However, a particularly low sample size for consistently shy 386 \nfish in the LR line, although originally expected considering previous theory regarding 387 \nbehaviour in LR animals, may limit the power to draw robust conclusions. Nonetheless 388 \nprevious studies have been unable to conclusively link novelty-induced boldness with stress 389 \nphysiology (e.g. Schjolden et al., 2005); our data indicate that this is due to both bold and shy 390 \nphenotypes existing amongst low and high stress-responding groups. 391 \n 392 \n17 \n \nThe absence of a well-defined link between cortisol levels and boldness within the lines was 393 \nsurprising given previously observed correlations between the magnitude of the stress 394 \nresponse and behaviour (Koolhaas et al., 1999; \u00d8verli et al., 2005). Both boldness and 395 \nshyness were represented within each selected line, and so the correlations between stress 396 \nresponsiveness and behaviour or boldness that have previously been reported (e.g. \u00d8verli et 397 \nal., 2007; Schjolden et al., 2005) are not always observed. One reason may be that if boldness 398 \nis context-specific individual behaviour will vary dependent upon the situation (e.g. in 399 \nfamiliar compared to unfamiliar environments; Schjolden et al., 2005). This would potentially 400 \nconfer adaptive advantages particularly in an inconsistent environment (Bell, 2007; Coleman 401 \nand Wilson, 1998; Wilson and Stevens, 2005). Such variation may be elicited by the type or 402 \nseverity of the stressor or by familiarity with the test environment (Brelin et al., 2008; Misslin 403 \nand Ropartz, 1981; Schjolden et al., 2005). Contrasting behavioural responses observed 404 \nbetween studies may additionally arise from variation in methodological approach to 405 \ncharacterising boldness. Furthermore, Schjolden et al. (2005) could not find consistent 406 \ndifferences in behavioural responses between HR and LR rainbow trout across several tests 407 \nincluding the response of the subjects to a novel object, which may be a result of comparing 408 \naverage behaviours between the lines rather than characterising boldness within each line as 409 \nin the present study. Thus whilst aggression, a defining component of coping styles and a 410 \nputative element of boldness, may strongly and consistently correlate with HPI axis reactivity 411 \nthe same is not necessarily true of responses to novelty. It therefore seems apparent that 412 \nboldness may not directly correlate with stress coping style, and future studies should explore 413 \nthe extent to which the stress response is linked with behavioural phenotype. However, there 414 \nis a need for standardisation in protocol to determine the degree of boldness and which 415 \nfeatures of an individual\u2019s behavioural repertoire are dependent on or act congruously with 416 \nhormonal stimulation under greater homeostatic threat. 417 \n18 \n \n 418 \nAlternatively, the existence of bold and shy phenotypes within line instead of correlating with 419 \nstress responsiveness suggests that coping style theory (Koolhaas et al., 1999) may simply 420 \nnot be true in all cases. Here, we provide novel data to suggest that divergent personality 421 \ntraits persist within a population or species irrespective of stress coping style. Experience, 422 \nbrought about by environmental or social influences, can shape an individual\u2019s behavioural 423 \nstrategy (Brown et al., 2007; Frost et al., 2007). Moreover, behavioural variation can occur 424 \nwithin a group regardless of genetic background, and when environmental conditions are 425 \nidentical for each individual (Metcalfe et al., 1989). With this in mind, it is not surprising that 426 \nthis study and other recent work have highlighted the complexity inherent in the genetic 427 \ncontrol of personalities (Korsten et al., 2010).  Our data reinforce this, since, despite previous 428 \nstudies that identified different gene expression profiles between outbred rainbow trout with 429 \ndifferent behaviours (e.g. dominance, Sneddon et al., 2005; boldness, L.U. Sneddon, MS 430 \nunder review), no such divergence between bold and shy fish was uncovered in this study. 431 \nGene expression may vary between discrete regions of the brain (Bernier et al., 1999; Feldker 432 \net al., 2003; Larson et al., 2006), and can relate directly to behavioural differentiation 433 \n(Greenwood et al., 2008), and thus a single measurement encompassing all brain regions 434 \ncould obscure more fine-scale differences in expression. Thus, whilst no difference in 435 \nexpression of the studied genes was found across the entire brain, that is not to say that bold 436 \nand shy individuals express these genes in different localised areas of the brain: whilst 437 \ndifferential expression of these genes between the stress lines was profound, variation 438 \namongst bold and shy groups may be more subtle. It is of course possible that the lines lack 439 \ngenetic diversity, or that different genes may be involved in the expression of bold\/shy 440 \nbehaviour. However, the clear divergence in expression of some of the examined genes in a 441 \nprevious study (LU Sneddon, MS under review) suggests the latter not to be the case, but 442 \n19 \n \ndoes emphasise the complexity of bold and shy personalities in rainbow trout. Given that the 443 \nexpression of boldness was independent of selection line, it is likely that the genetic control 444 \nof boldness may be unrelated to the controlling divergent elements of the selected stress 445 \nresponse.  446 \n  447 \nConclusions and Implications 448 \nThe results of this study indicate a complex relationship between stress responsiveness and 449 \nbehaviour in the HR and LR lines of rainbow trout.  Stress responsiveness is a heritable trait 450 \nin trout (Pottinger and Carrick, 1999; Pottinger and Carrick, 2001a) and the present study 451 \ndemonstrated that divergence in stress responsiveness correlates with differential expression 452 \nof six novel candidate genes with functions in relevant behaviour and physiology. However, 453 \ncontrary to our hypothesis, the physiological and gene expression responses evident in the 454 \nselected HR and LR lines did not correlate with boldness or shyness, traits that were 455 \nidentified in substantial numbers within each line. This suggests that the adoption of these 456 \ncontrasting behavioural strategies may not be explained entirely by genetic background or 457 \nstress coping style and may instead be influenced by external factors that should be 458 \nconsidered in theoretical and empirical studies. Experience and environmental influences 459 \nmay cause quite distinct changes in behavioural responses throughout an animal\u2019s life history 460 \n(Frost et al., 2007; Ruiz-Gomez et al., 2008), which may result in behavioural polymorphism 461 \neven within coping styles. Therefore, it is important for future studies to take into account of 462 \nhow experience and external factors may mould boldness. This may explain why variation in 463 \nthese behavioural phenotypes persists in natural populations to ensure a proportion of 464 \nindividuals can adapt to and survive any perturbations.  465 \n 466 \nAcknowledgements 467 \n20 \n \nJT is supported by a NERC CASE PhD studentship (NE\/F008120\/1) supervised by LS, PW 468 \nand TGP.
