INTRODUCTION\nTHERE IS an increasing demand for wind energy withthe impetus coming from international legislation, envi-\nronmental concerns, and the long-term availability of fossil\nfuels. International concern over climate change is resulting\nin political and regulatory pressure to reduce carbon-dioxide\nemissions, and many governments are actively seeking to in-\ncrease the percentage share of the total electrical supply energy\nfrom renewable sources. Wind energy is viewed in this respect\nas a clean renewable source of energy, which produces no\ngreenhouse-gas emissions or waste products. There are other\nsources of renewable energy, but wind energy is currently\nviewed as the lowest risk and most proven technology capable\nof providing significant levels of renewable energy in world\nterms. There has been a sustained effort over the past couple\nof decades to increase the power ratings of wind turbines\nat the same time improving their reliability and raising their\navailability. At present, 2\u20133-MW wind turbines are regarded\nas the standard, but the industry views 5 MW as the near-term\ntarget for single vertical turbines.\nPaper IPCSD-06-071, presented at the 2005 Industry Applications Society\nAnnual Meeting, Hong Kong, October 2\u20136, and approved for publication\nin the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS by the Electric\nMachines Committee of the IEEE Industry Applications Society.

Modern vertical wind\nturbines are normally variable-speed units, and this requires\nthe generator to be interfaced to the grid through an electronic\npower converter. Conventional generators such as induction\nor synchronous (permanent magnet or wound) options are\nviable, but these require the grid-side converter to be rated to\nmatch the generator. For very large wind turbines (> 2 MW,\nfor example), these converters are complex and expensive at\ncurrent prices. One of the preferred options at present therefore,\nfor large turbines in excess of 2-MW rating, is the variable-\nspeed doubly fed (DF) induction generator (IG) with the rotor\nconverter connected to the rotor via slip rings [1]. This is in\nessence a slip-energy-recovery system, used for many years\nin large motor drives, taking direct advantage of the fact that\nlimiting the speed range of the drive can reduce the rating\nof the converter and modern converter technology to improve\nthe control of speed. Most wind turbines naturally restrict\nfeasible operation to typically 30% above and below [2] the\ngenerator synchronous speed, and thus, a 3-MW wind turbine,\nfor example, can operate with the stator connected directly to\nthe grid and a 1-MW rotor-side converter to provide variable\nspeed. This translates directly into significant cost savings for\nthe rotor converter and also improves the overall reliability of\nthe converter. The disadvantage of this option is the need for a\nslip-ring connection to the rotor, but this is still currently viewed\nas one of the preferred options for large wind turbines.\nModern DF turbine generators utilize a bidirectional\npulsewidth-modulation (PWM) inverter that can control both\nthe rotor voltage and phase angle so that the generator can\noperate at variable speed with control of the stator power factor\nover the nominal speed range [2]\u2013[7]. As wind speeds fall, the\ngenerator output power reduces until the power extracted from\nthe wind is insufficient to maintain the gear train and generator\nlosses, and the generator would normally be disconnected from\nthe grid at this point. Some commercial generator systems use\nstar\/delta-winding connections as one means of extending this\nspeed range. Turbine manufacturers have recently proposed\nan operating scheme for low wind speeds that is claimed to\nimprove the overall energy extraction and extend the operating\nspeed range at which useful power can be extracted from the\nwind. The proposed operating scheme is to use a DFIG for\nnormal wind conditions, but as the wind speed falls, the stator\ndisconnects from the grid and short circuits it. The generator\nthen reverts to a conventional IG mode of operation with all the\npower channeled through the rotor-side converter to the grid.\n0093-9994\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

DF connection.\nFig. 2. IG connection.\nThe objective of this paper is to examine in detail the perfor-\nmance benefits for this new mode of wind-generator operation\nand to provide a fundamental understanding of the differences\nin the generator operation in both connections. This paper will\nutilize conventional steady-state equivalent circuits to provide\nthis insight but will also correlate the operating performance\nwith that obtained from the conventional closed-loop dynamic\ncontroller [8], [9]. This paper will also provide experimental\nresults obtained from a laboratory test machine to validate the\nsteady-state and dynamic simulations.\nII. GENERATOR\u2014DOUBLE-SIDED AND\nSINGLE-SIDED CONNECTIONS\nFig. 1 illustrates the conventional DF connection. Power\nflows into the rotor circuits via the rotor-side converter below\nsynchronous speed and vice versa above synchronous speed.\nThe grid-side inverter is typically controlled to maintain a\nconstant dc link voltage, drawing unity power factor from\nthe supply network [4]. The rotor-side inverter is controlled\nseparately. The generator power factor can be controlled to\nprovide reactive power and to regulate the local-grid voltage.\nHowever, operation at unity power factor is often desirable [10]\nwhen connected to lower voltage distribution networks to limit\nthe level of plant upgrade needed.\nFig. 2 illustrates the IG connection. The stator windings are\ninitially disconnected from the grid and are then short circuited\nFig. 3. Equivalent circuit for DFIG.\nas shown. In practice, the generator would be switched from\none connection to the other using appropriate switchgear and\nswitching-sequence control. The generator then behaves as a\nnormal IG except that the rotor circuit now acts as the only grid\nconnection through the rotor converter. This type of connection\nhas occasionally been used in the past as a means of starting\na DFIG.\nIII. STEADY-STATE MODEL\nThe standard steady-state per-phase equivalent circuit can be\nutilized for assessing the performance of both double-sided and\nsingle-sided connections subject to the usual assumptions of a\nthree-phase balanced supply, fixed rotor speed, and constant\nmachine parameters. Fig. 3 illustrates the conventional per-\nphase equivalent circuit for an IG in which the rotor circuits are\nreferred to the stator frequency, so that all machine reactances\nare determined at supply frequency. This frequency transfor-\nmation also scales the applied rotor voltage by the rotor slip, as\nshown in Fig. 3.\nSolution of this equivalent circuit for the DF connection re-\nquires a search routine because there is more than one combina-\ntion of rotor voltage and rotor phase angle that meets the known\nconstraints of rotor speed, shaft torque, and stator rms voltage.\nThe solution procedure starts from a power balance applied\nto the rotor.\nThe electrical power flowing into (PIN) and out (POUT) of\nthe rotor is defined as follows:\nPROUT =Re\n{\n3EI\u00af \u2032\u22172\n} (1)\nPRIN =Re\n{\n3V\n\u2032\n2I\u00af\n\u2032\u2217\n2\n}\n(2)\nwhere the rotor voltages and currents are defined in Fig. 3. The\nrotor electrical losses are\nPRLOSS = 3\n\u2223\u2223I\u00af \u20322\u2223\u22232R\u20322 (3)\nwhere R\u20322 is the referred rotor resistance.\nThe only other power flow in or out of the rotor is the\nmechanical power defined as\nPRIN(mech) = T\u03c9r (4)\nwhere T is the generator torque, and \u03c9r is the shaft speed.\nApplying power balance to the rotor, we get\nPRIN + P\nR\nIN(mech) = PROUT + PRLOSS (5)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

(6)\nThis can be simplified by utilizing the circuit equations\nfrom Fig. 3\nV 1 + I\u00af1Z1 =E (7)\nV\n\u2032\n2\ns\n= I\u00af \u20322Z2 +E. (8)\nRearranging (6)\u2013(8), we get\nT\u03c9s = Re\n{\n3\nV\n\u2032\n2\ns\nI\u00af \u2032\u22172\n}\n\u2212 3 \u2223\u2223I\u00af \u20322\u2223\u22232 R\u20322s (9)\nwhere \u03c9s is the synchronous speed.\nThis equation represents the basic torque equation for the DF\ngenerator. It also represents the starting point for the search rou-\ntine to determine the required rotor voltage and phase angle. For\nany given wind speed, it is assumed that the known parameters\nare the shaft torque T , the generator speed, which defines the\nrotor slip s, and the rms grid voltage V1. The objective is to\ndetermine the rotor voltage V \u20322 and phase angle so that certain\nconstraints are satisfied. The basic algorithm involves using the\ntorque T and the rotor slip s to determine the rotor current I \u20322 for\nany given rotor voltage and phase angle. The rotor current can\nthen be used to determine the stator voltage V1 and the stator\ncurrent I1. The first basic constraint that must be satisfied is the\nvoltage V1, which must equate to the grid voltage. Secondary\nconstraints can then be added such as maximum rotor voltage\nand maximum rotor and stator currents. A final constraint can\nbe included if the stator power factor needs to be controlled:\nThe phase angle between V1 and I1 should be zero.\nThe initial step is to determine the rotor current from the\nshaft torque. This can be obtained from (9) in a straightforward\nmanner if we use the rotor current as the reference phase angle\nin the equivalent circuit rather than the conventional supply\nvoltage. The phase angles are therefore defined as follows:\nI\u00af \u20322 = I\n\u2032\n2\u22200 V\n\u2032\n2 = V\n\u2032\n2\u2220\u03c62 V 1 = V1\u2220\u03c6 I\u00af1 = I1\u2220\u03c61.\nEquation (9) reduces now to the solution of a simple quadratic\nequation\n\u2223\u2223I\u00af \u20322\u2223\u2223 = V\n\u2032\n2 cos\u03c62 \u2212\n\u221a\n(V \u20322 cos\u03c62)\n2 \u2212 (4\/3)R\u20322Ts\u03c9s\n2R\u20322\n. (10)\nClearly, for a specified torque and slip, the rotor current can\nbe determined for any rotor voltage V \u20322 and phase angle \u03c62.\nThe air-gap electromovite force (EMF) E can then be obtained\ndirectly from (8) followed by the stator current I1\nI\u00af1 = I\u00af \u20322 \u2212\nE\nZm\n(11)\nand, finally, the stator voltage V1 from (7).\nThe final step in the algorithm is to check the constraints,\nand if these are satisfied, then the rotor voltage and phase angle\nrepresent a valid operating point for the DF generator.\nThe complete search algorithm can be summarized\nas follows.\n1) Loop for all possible values of rotor voltage V \u20322 and phase\nangle \u03c62.\n2) Determine rotor current I \u20322 for specified torque and slip.\n3) Calculate air-gap EMF E.\n4) Determine the stator current I1.\n5) Determine the stator voltage V1.\n6) Check all constraints for valid rotor voltage V \u20322 and phase\nangle \u03c62.\nThe algorithm will index through all possible combinations\nof the rotor rms voltage and phase angle to find the values of V \u20322\nand \u03c62 that ensures the stator voltage matches the grid voltage\nand also satisfies the additional constraints including the stator\npower factor, for example.\nFor the single-sided IG-connection mode, the solution of\nthe conventional equivalent circuit is modified. The speed and\ntorque are known, so the equivalent circuit can be used to deter-\nmine the stator and rotor currents and hence the required rotor\nvoltage V \u20322 to sustain these. In the IG mode, the search variable\nis now the generator supply frequency. The constraints are also\nmodified to include an additional check that the air-gap field\ndoes not exceed its rated value. This is normally determined\nby the air-gap EMF E divided by the supply frequency. The\nremaining constraints relate to maximum voltage and current\nratings. The search routine, as before, determines the maximum\ngenerated output power and can be summarized as follows.\n1) Loop for all possible values of rotor-converter frequency.\n2) Determine stator current for specified torque and slip.\n3) Calculate air-gap EMF E.\n4) Determine the rotor current.\n5) Determine the rotor supply voltage.\n6) Check all constraints for valid rotor frequency.\nIV. TRANSIENT-GENERATOR MODEL\nAND CONTROL STRATEGY\nOn a practical wind turbine, the generator will have a\nreal-time controller that will seek optimal performance under\nvarying wind conditions. These are commonly based upon a\nfield-orientated control algorithm [11] that uses power and\nstator reactive power as the reference parameters. The field-\norientated control scheme incorporates a two-axis generator\nmachine model and ensures that the generator operates at the\nreference points. To validate the steady-state algorithm de-\nscribed in the previous section, it is important to ensure that the\ndynamic real-time controller will produce the same operating\npoint, as that determined by the steady-state model, by match-\ning the control reference values to the performance constraints.\nThe results therefore include the operating performance of the\ngenerator using a simulated real-time controller.\nThe control model used in this paper incorporates a con-\nventional two-axis model of the DF machine into a field-\norientated scheme orientated to the stator flux linkage [8], [11].\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

DF connection (steady-state model).\nThe generator torque and stator power factor are used as the\nreference control parameters.\nIn the IG mode, a conventional field-orientated scheme\n[12]\u2013[14] is also used, but it is adapted to reflect the fact that the\nconverter supply is connected to the rotating rotor rather than\na conventional-stator connection.\nV. EXPERIMENTAL TEST GENERATOR\nThe analytical work described in the previous sections was\nvalidated using a small 7.5-kW six-pole wound-rotor test gen-\nerator coupled to a dc motor on a laboratory test bed. A 15-kW\nbidirectional commercial converter was connected to the rotor\nslip rings. The real-time control scheme was created using\nMATLAB\/SIMULINK and interfaced to the converter control\nprocessor using a dSPACE real-time development platform.\nA detailed set of simulated results using both steady-state\nand dynamic control models was undertaken over a speed\nrange from approximately 10% below synchronous speed\n(1000 r\/min) to 40% below. Measured wind speed\/power data\nfrom a commercial system were scaled and used to determine\nthe generator torque for any given speed. Experimental results\nwere recorded on the test generator in the IG-connection mode\nover the same speed range.\nFig. 4 illustrates the rotor voltage and current obtained using\nthe steady-state model for the DF connection, with and with-\nout stator-power-factor control, over a speed range reducing\nfrom the normal generator synchronous speed of 1000 r\/min.\nIf no stator-power-factor control is required, the algorithm\nsearches for the maximum generator efficiency by minimizing\nthe winding copper losses. The efficiency of the rotor converter\nis not included in the search. It is clear from this figure that\nconstraining the stator power factor results in a small increase\nin the rotor supply voltage but a more significant increase\nin the rotor current. This additional current has to be provided\nby the rotor converter and is needed to inject reactive power into\nthe rotor to ensure unity stator power factor. The rotor current\nin both cases however remains relatively constant as the speed\nreduces. The rotor voltage on the other hand is determined\nmainly by the rotor speed and increases linearly as the rotor\nTABLE I\nDF MODE\u20147.5 kW\u2014STEADY-STATE EQUATIONS (NO pf CONTROL)\nTABLE II\nDF MODE\u20147.5 kW\u2014STEADY-STATE EQUATIONS (pf CONTROL)\nslip increases or speed reduces. This is an important factor in\ndetermining the rating of the rotor converter.\nTables I and II summarize the power, reactive power, and\nefficiency values. Again, it is clear from these that there is\na little change in the stator output power but a significant\nincrease in the rotor reactive power for unity stator power\nfactor. The stator power factor is relatively low in this generator\nwhen uncontrolled. The efficiency, on the other hand, is lower\nwith power-factor control because of the additional losses\ncaused by the extra current required to improve the power\nfactor. In addition, it is evident that the efficiency begins to fall\nsignificantly with power-factor control as the speed reaches the\nlowest point in Table II. The efficiencies in general, however,\nare slightly high because only copper losses are included in the\nsimulated results.\nFig. 5 illustrates the comparison between the steady-state\nresults and those obtained using the real-time dynamic control\nmodel used in the laboratory generator.\nIt is clear that the correlation between the rotor voltage and\ncurrent is excellent, confirming the validity of the steady-state\napproach in finding the optimum operating point. Table III\nsummarizes the power, reactive power, and efficiency, and\nagain, there is an excellent correlation with those obtained using\nthe steady-state model in Table II. It confirms the capability of\nthe steady-state approach described in this paper in undertaking\ndetailed performance predictions for wind generators that\nwould normally be operating under real-time dynamic control.\nThe steady-state model will also act as a useful design tool for\ngenerator systems in wind-turbine applications.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Experimental results of 7.5-kW generator.\nthe DF connection. This particular operational feature is impor-\ntant and is due to the constraint that the airgap flux is maintained\nbelow the rated value to avoid overfluxing the machine. In this\ncase, as the speed reduces, the rotor supply frequency reduces\nto keep the slip low, and as a result, the terminal voltage also re-\nduces to avoid saturating the magnetizing paths in the generator.\nTable IV summarizes the generated power, the rotor power\nfactor at the generator terminals, and the efficiency. The\nvalues for the dynamic model match the steady-state values\nvery closely, therefore, are omitted here for brevity.

Steady-state model of 2-MW generator.\nVI. 2-MW COMMERCIAL WIND GENERATOR\nThe experimental results were performed on a small 7.5-kW\nlaboratory test generator, and it would be unwise to scale any\nparticular conclusion from those tests to a large commercial\nmegawatt generator. For this reason, a theoretical study was\nperformed on a 2-MW 690-V four-pole DF generator using the\nmachine parameters provided by the manufacturer to make a\nrealistic assessment of the benefits of the steady-state model\nand the proposed new IG-connection mode. There was no\ninformation relating to the rotor converter available, so it will be\nassumed that it would be rated typically to 30% of the generator,\nwhich equates to approximately 600 kVA.\nFig. 8 illustrates the rotor voltage and current for the DF\nconnection using the steady-state algorithm, and as expected,\nthe rotor voltage is largely controlled by the speed, and more\nrotor current is needed if the unity stator power factor is re-\nquired. Furthermore, the maximum rotor current occurs close to\nsynchronous speed (1500 r\/min) where the amount of available\nwind power is the highest in this speed range. Tables VI and\nVII summarize the power, reactive power, and efficiencies with\nand without stator-power-factor control. Efficiencies are high\nin both cases, which is to be expected in higher power ratings,\nalthough, again, only copper losses have been included. There\nTABLE VI\nDF MODE\u20142 MW\u2014STEADY-STATE EQUATIONS (NO pf CONTROL)\nTABLE VII\nDF MODE\u20142 MW\u2014STEADY-STATE EQUATIONS (pf CONTROL)\nFig. 9. DF- and IG-connection modes (steady-state model).\nis a little significant reduction in the efficiency in this larger\nrating until the speed falls to 400 r\/min or 73% slip.\nFig. 9 illustrates the DF connection with power-factor control\nin direct comparison with the IG-connection mode. Again, it\nis evident that in the IG mode, the rotor voltage reduces as\nthe speed reduces, and although the rotor currents are virtually\nidentical at high speeds, the current falls away more signifi-\ncantly in the IG mode as the speed falls. Table VIII summarizes\nthe grid power, rotor reactive power, and efficiency, and it is\nclear that there is a little difference in the efficiency until the\nspeed falls to 400 r\/min.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Restrictions apply. \nSMITH et al.: IMPROVED ENERGY CONVERSION FOR DOUBLY FED WIND GENERATORS 1427\nTABLE VIII\nIG MODE\u20142 MW\u2014STEADY-STATE MODEL\nThe question therefore remains: What is the benefit of\nswitching to the new IG-connection mode as the wind speed\nfalls? The evidence in this section would suggest that the gains\nin output grid power are minimal in comparison to the DF\nconnection with or without power-factor control. In fact, at\nhigher speeds, the DF mode produces slightly more power. The\nbenefits would therefore appear to lie in the rotor-converter\nratings. The overall rating of the converter is related to the\nrequired speed range, which is typically 30% of the generator\nrating, as mentioned previously. However, the VA converter\nrating would be translated into maximum current and voltage\nratings of the switching devices in the converter.\nThe device voltage rating is determined by the effective gen-\nerator turns ratio, which relates the rotor voltage to the stator or\ngrid voltage. In the steady-state model, however, the equivalent-\ncircuit model uses referred rotor voltages, so the maximum\noperational rotor voltage for 30% slip would correspond to\napproximately 120 V. Fig. 8 confirms that this would equate\nto a minimum speed of 1050 r\/min in the DF-connection mode.\nThe limiting factor therefore for operation at low speeds\nin the DF-connection mode is the rotor voltage, even if the\navailable wind power is low. The rotor voltage is determined\nlargely by the rotor slip. This is not the case in the IG mode\nwhere it is evident from the figures in both 7.5-kW and\n2-MW-generator cases that the rotor voltage reduces as the\nspeed reduces. The rotor voltage in this case is determined\nessentially by the converter supply frequency, and this reduces\nas the speed reduces. Fig. 9 clearly indicates that operation\nbelow approximately 700 r\/min would only be possible in\nthe IG connection without exceeding the voltage and current\nratings of the rotor converter. In this particular example, there\nappears to be an operational gap between 1050-r\/min DF mode\nand 750-r\/min IG mode where the rotor voltage exceeds the\nestimated voltage limit. However, this is a theoretical study on\na 2-MW generator, and the operating speed range was assumed\nto be 30% above and below synchronous speed. It would be a\nsimple design exercise to ensure that in practice, the operational\nspeed range could be extended seamlessly using the proposed\nIG-connection mode.\nAnother possible area where the IG-connection mode may\nhave potential benefits is fault ride-through. There is a signifi-\ncant concern at the moment about protecting the rotor converter\nin the event of a sag or dip in the grid voltage at the stator\nterminals when the generator is connected in the DF mode. The\npresent practice is to simply crowbar the connection between\nthe converter and the rotor terminals. An alternative strategy\nmight be to switch to the IG connection when a voltage sag or\ndip is detected. The rotor converter would then have full control\nof all power and reactive power flow through the generator.\nIn both cases, the economic benefits of implementing the\nIG-connection mode needs to be counterbalanced by the costs\nof the additional switchgear associated with the switching\nsequences of grid disconnection and synchronization before\ngrid reconnection. Solid-state switches would be a practical\nsolution if rapid grid disconnection\/reconnection transitions\nwere necessary.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nThere is presently a significant interest in large offshore\nwind turbines up to 5 MW. One of the preferred options for\nthese large turbines is the DF slip-ring generators that offset\nthe cost of the rotor converter against a reduced operating\nspeed range. Turbine manufacturers have proposed an operating\nscheme for low wind speeds that is claimed to improve the\noverall energy extraction and extend the operating speed range\nat which useful power can be extracted from the wind. The\nproposed operating scheme is to use a DFIG for normal wind\nconditions, but as the wind speed falls, the stator disconnects\nfrom the grid and short circuits it. The generator then reverts\nto a conventional IG mode of operation with all the power\nchanneled through the rotor-side converter to the grid. Steady-\nstate equivalent-circuit models have been developed to examine\nthe performance benefits of both connections, and these have\nbeen validated against a practical real-time control scheme\nand also in laboratory experimental results on a small 7.5-kW\ngenerator. These have illustrated the significance of rotor volt-\nage rating on the performance benefits. The DF-generator\nconnection can be controlled to maintain close-to-unity power\nfactor down to low wind speeds, but its operational speed limit\nis determined by the rising rotor voltage that increases with\nslip. Switching to the new single-sided connection (IG mode)\nstill maintains unity power factor but allows the speed to reduce\nfurther, extracting more energy from the wind because the rotor\nvoltage is now reducing as the speed reduces. The steady-\nstate models for both DF- and IG-connection modes have been\nshown to be useful and accurate design tools for large wind-\nturbine operation in low-wind-speed conditions.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis paper is published with the approval of FKI Energy\nTechnology, current owners of the wind-turbine manufacturer\nDeWind.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.
