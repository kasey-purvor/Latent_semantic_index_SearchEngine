INTRODUCTION \nThe increasing demand for high-power electronic \nconverters to be connected directly to finite-impedance AC \nutility supplies (power utility or stand-alone generator) and \nincreasingly stringent regulations regarding harmonic \ndistortion is focusing attention on cost effective methods for \nmitigating problems associated with harmonic. In addition to \ndistortion of the voltage waveform, harmonic currents cause \nadditional heating, and can result in over-voltages due to \nresonances, metering errors, malfunctions of protection relays \nand interference with communication and control signals, etc. \nFurthermore, phase-controlled converters are known to create \n\u2018notches\u2019 in the utility voltage waveform and draw power at a \nrelatively poor displacement (power) factor. \nTraditionally, economic and technological constraints have \nmeant that equipment manufacturers have addressed these \nproblems by incorporating a passive RLC filter at the input to \neach converter. -However, with recent reductions in the cost \nof switching devices and the availability of inexpensive, \ndigital processing hardware, embedded approaches to actively \nreduce the generation of high current harmonics onto the \nsupply, are attracting increasing attention. \nA typical topology for an active power filter is the so-called \ndoubled-sided converter, shown in Figure 1. The line input is \ngenerally fiom the power utility or a stand-alone generator. \nDue to its symmetrical structure, the line-side converter can \nact as either a rectifier or an inverter, thereby allowing bi- \ndirectional power flow by using appropriate pulse-width \nmodulation (PWM) techniques. \nThe current control system is the primary component of all \nactive power filtering systems; the basic objectives being, \n(i) To reduce amplitude and phase errors (i.e. ideal \ntracking) between the reference and output currents \nover the specified output frequency range; \nLine \nFigure 1. Double-sided converter , combining active power \nfilter and voltage source converter. \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \nThe \nHigh bandwidth, in order to provide a good dynamic \nsystem performance; \nLimited variation of the switching fiequency, so as to \nensure safe operation of the power switching devices; \nand \nGood utilization of the dc link voltage, to \naccommodate a wide speed range of the generator \nandor load machine. \nsimplest current control scheme is hysteresis control. \nHowever, the switching fiequency then depends largely on \nthe load parameters and hysteresis band, and may vary \nwidely. Thus, currently, for most commercial applications, \nfixed frequency P W M  current controllers, based on linear PI- \nregulator control constructs, are employed. However, whilst \nthese are particularly suitable for tracking steady-state \nquantities, when applied to tracking sinusoidal inputs, they \nnaturally impart phase errors (as a classical frequency \nresponse characteristic will show), a feature that is \nparticularly detrimental to the requirement for unity power \nfactor operation. Appropriately designed tracking \ncompensators are, therefore, necessary. Many authors have \nrecently proposed controller design methodologies for active \nfilters, one of the more promising being that proposed in [I], \nwhich employs intemal model control, which is shown to \nprovide a degree of robustness to parametric uncertainties. \nHowever, the controller was not designed specifically for \ncurrent tracking, and important issues such as the rejection of \nsystem input and output disturbances, and non-linearities \nassociated with the converter and its modulation control, were \nnot directly addressed. \nIn this paper, quantitative feedback theory (QFT) is \nemployed to design the current tracking controllers. Design \ndifficulties stemming from system uncertainties, such as line \nfilter parameter variations, non-linearities due to over- \nmodulation of the voltage source inverter and switching of the \npower components, system output disturbances due to current \nharmonics, and system input disturbances from d.c. link \n948 0-7803-7091 -0\/01\/$10\u00b02001 IEEE \n1 \nvoltage fluctuations etc., are either explicitly or implicitly \nconsidered in the design of the controller. \nA schematic of the proposed two-degree-of-freedom \ncontrol system is shown in Figure 2. \nInductance L \n( P H I  \n180 - 220 \nInput disturbancc Output disturbancc \nG P \nmpensator Active til \nResistance R Voltage factor \n( m Q )  K \n7.2 - 72.0 180 - 240 \nFigure 2. Two-degree-of-freedom current control system. \n11. QUANTITATIVE F EDBACK THEORY (QFT) \nAs an extension to the pioneering work of Bode, Nyquist, \nNichols, and others, Horowitz [2] introduced a frequency \ndomain-design methodology which was refined in the 1970\u2019s \nto its present form, commonly referred to as Quantitative \nFeedback Theory (QFT), [3]. The underlying principles of \ntwo-degree-of-freedom QFT problem is to \u2018tune\u2019 the amount \nof inner-loop gain to accommodate specific amounts of plant \nand disturbance uncertainty, whilst the pre-filter is used to \nprovide the desired \u2018shape\u2019 of the closed-loop dynamics. \nAlthough other two-degree-of-freedom design methodologies \nhave attracted substantial attention over the past decade (e.g. \nH-), QFT has the advantage of leaving the designer to make \nthe quantitative trade-off between performance and controller \ncomplexity. Based on the properties of the Nichols chart, the \nunderlying principle of the technique consists of obtaining a \nset of frequency-domain boundaries about a nominal loop \ntransfer function. These bounds are then used as a guide for \nshaping the loop transfer function, and, in so doing, to also \naccommodate any uncertainty. \nTo date, a major impediment to the adoption of QFT for \ncontrol system design has been the graphical manipulation \nrequired during the design process, and the significant \nexperience required of the designer. However, the emergence \nof a PC-based graphical QFT toolbox [4] has been \ninstrumental in attracting a wider audience to the merits of \nQFT. \nThe design methodology generally involves four basic \nsteps, viz.: (1) definition of problem data and generation of \nplant templates, (2) computation of QFT bounds, (3) design \nof controller and pre-filter (for tracking controllers) using \nloop-shaping techniques, and (4) analysis validation of the \nresulting design. \n111. MODELING OF ACTIVE POWER FILTER \nEach input line of the active power filter can be modeled as \na resistance connected in series with an inductance. If it is \nassumed that the power drawn from the supply has unity \npower factor, and that the phase voltage is controlled by the \nmodulation depth m in the PWh4 modulator, the open-loop \ntransfer function which relates the phase current to the \nmodulation depth reduces to, \nwhere R and L are, respectively, the resistance and inductance \nof the line boost inductor, and K is the voltage factor relating \nthe d.c. link voltage to the PWM modulation depth. \nPractically, L and R are known only to a limited accuracy, \nan error within *lo% being very common. They are also \ndependent on frequency and operating condition, and it is \nestimated that in the frequency range of interest, viz. up to \nlkHz, the inductance could decrease by around 7%, whilst \nthe resistance could increase by a factor of 10. Table 1 gives \ntypical values of these two parameters in the application \nunder consideration. \nTable 1. Typical parameter uncertainties in the active \nIn double-sided converters, from the a.c. sides both \nconverters appear as buck converters. Thus, the d.c. link \nvoltage has to be higher than the peak values of both the line \nand load voltages. In electrical drive applications, the dc-link \nvoltage is allowed to vary within a bounded range during \nmotoring and regenerative braking of the machine, whilst in \nothers, such as those incorporating super-capacitor energy \nstorage, a tunable d.c. link voltage is beneficial to overall \nsystem energy efficiency. Such a fluctuating d.c. link voltage \nmay be regarded as an input disturbance to the current control \nsystem. However, it can be more conveniently considered as a \nparameter uncertainty in the QFT design. A typical variation \nof the voltage factor in an active power filter is shown in \nTable 1, assuming that the modulation remains in the linear \nregion. \nIn addition to the parametric uncertainties in the system, \nnon-linearities stemming from the switching characteristic of \nthe power switching devices, and saturation non-linearity due \nto over-modulation, are also present. However, whilst the \nformer may be generally regarded as parameter uncertainty in \nthe voltage factor, the latter has to be dealt with carefully at \nthe control design stage, as will be discussed later. \nOther disturbances include imperfections in the modulation \nalgorithm and the resultant current harmonics in the output. \nIV. ROBUST CURRENT RACKING CONTROL \nDESIGN \nThe control objective is to synthesize the pre-filter, F(s), \nand the inner-loop compensator, G(s), in the two-degree-of- \nfreedom feedback configuration such that, with minimal \ncontrol effort, the resulting system provides the desired \ncurrent tracking capability, and good disturbance attenuation \nperformance. \n999 \nA .  Current Control Performance Specifcation \n1) Robust Stability: The current control system must \nmaintain its stability properties over the full range of \nparametric uncertainty. To accommodate this, a constraint on \nthe peak magnitude of the complementary sensitivity function \nfor the range of potential open-loop transfer hnctions \n(described by templates), can be employed. For example, the \nrequirement \nimplies that at least a 50\" phase margin and at least 1.8 gain \nmargin is desired. \n2) Current Tracking: Tracking performance can be \nsatisfied by setting upper and lower bounds on the closed- \nloop time-domain transient characteristic. Normally, an \nunder-damped time response is specified for the upper \nbounds, e.g. with an overshoot of 20%, and a rise time of \n0.5ms corresponding to the required lkHz current tracking. \nAn over-damped time response would be suitable for the \nlower bound, and again, the rise time is set at 0.5ms. Second- \norder transfer functions which describe the upper and lower \nbounds in the frequency-domain are: \n( 3 )  \n(4) \n1 . 0 4 ~  lo4 (s + 2000) \n2.56~10' \nT =  \nRU s2  +9000s+2.08x107 \nT =  \nRL s 2  +3200Os+2.56x1Os \n{Note: In order to extend the spread between the upper and \nlower bounds in the high-frequency range, a zero is \nintroduced in TR, without unduly affecting the desired time- \nresponse characteristics.} \nSince the plant is minimum phase, a tolerance on the \nmagnitude is sufficient for design: \nfor o E [0,6283] ( 5 )  \n3) Control Effort Constraint: PWM control of a voltage \nsource converter in an active power filter has a limited range \nof operation. For example, if space vector PWM is employed, \nthe linear control range can be up to 1.15. However, for \ngenerality this paper considers a simple PWM algorithm with \na linear control range from 0 to 1 .  Any value beyond this will \npush the PWM into over-modulation, i.e. the PWM control \nwill introduce a hard saturation non-linearity which may \ndegrade the system tracking performance, and should, \ntherefore, be avoided in the design over the frequency range \nof interest. The worst case scenario is when the converter \nsupplies its maximum rated current, i.e. 90Amps, and the \nPWM control reaches its saturation level of 1. Thus, the \nfollowing constraint is imposed \n1-1 <: 0.01 1, for o < 6283rad \/ s (7) \n1 + G ( j o ) P ( j w )  \n4) Output Disturbance Attenuation: Due to the limited \nswitching frequency of the converter power components, and \nimperfections in the PWM, there will inevitably be some \ncurrent harmonics at the output that will constitute an output \ndisturbance to the control system. Consequently, a constraint \non the magnitude of the sensitivity function is included in the \ndesign, \nl&l< 1 . 6 ~ 1 0 - ~ 0 ) ,  for w < 6283rad\/s \n(8) \nIt should be noted that this specification requires the system \nto have infinite attenuation at low frequencies, and thereby \nnecessitates the inclusion of integral action. \nB. Robust Current Control Design \nA QFT-based controller design will now be expounded to \nsatisfy the previously highlighted performance requirements. \nThe performance specifications are consequently translated \nonto magnitude vs. phase plots (i.e. Nichols charts), and \nsubsequently combined into a single set of \"worst case\" \nperformance boundaries, Figure 3 (using facilities available in \nthe QFT-toolbox). The objective of the design is to loop- \nshape G ( j o ) P ( j o ) ,  by appropriate choice of the \ncompensator G( jo) and pre-filter F(  jo) , such that at each \nfrequency the magnitude and phase-shift of the nominal loop \ntransfer function lies 'above' or 'outside' the respective \nperformance boundary. \nIntersection of Bounds  \n20.8.. . . b . .  ~ . # ~ . .  . ~ : \n, \/-\"yy- \n. . ~-: . . . 1 ZOO0 radls . . \n-350 -300 -250 -200 -150 -100 -50 0 \nPhase ( d e g r e e s )  \nFigure 3 .  Combined performance bounds of robust control \nsystem. \n950 3 \n1) Compensator Design: The initial step of the design is to \nclose the loop by designing the compensator G(s) (assuming \nF(s )=l ) .  Loop-shaping is employed to design an \nappropriate compensator to satisfy the combined boundary \nconstraints shown in Figure 3. The result of an iterative loop- \nshaping procedure is shown in Figure 4, which indicates that \nthe system is stable and all the desired performance attributes \nare satisfied. The resulting compensator is: \n(9) \n(s + 390) (s +1125) \n90 s (s + 18) G(s) = \n2) Pre-Filter Design: Following the design of G(s) , the \ndesign of the pre-filterF(s) to meet the dynamic tracking \nperformance specification is addressed, resulting in the \nclosed-loop frequency response shown in Figure 5. The pre- \nfilter is given by: \n(10) \n2.65 1x108 \n(s+ 6400) (s +4.143x104) F(s)  = \n3 5 0  3 0 0  -250 -200 -150 -100 -50 0 \nPhaae (degrees) \nFigure 4.

COMPUTER SIMULATIONS \nThe resulting control system design and its specification \nhave been verified by computer simulations. In addition, the \nperformance of the controller has been compared with that of \na 'conventionally-designed' PI compensator. \nA. Computer Simulations \nSince current harmonics due to the converter switching and \nimperfect PWM are regarded as disturbances, and over- \nmodulation non-linearity has been treated during the \ncontroller design stage, the transfer function described by Eq. \n(1) is used for simulations. This is a linear system with \nparameter uncertainties. \nFigure 6 shows the step responses of the closed-loop system \nsubject to parameter variations over the stipulated range, and \nconfirms that the transient dynamic characteristics have been \nsatisfied. The tracking performance can be assessed by \nconsidering the frequency response from the current reference \ndemand to the current output, Figure 7, together with three \nexamples of time-domain responses at input frequencies of \n60Hz, 400Hz and lkHz, to represent, respectively, drive \napplications in the industrial, aerospace and specialist market \nsectors, Figure 8(a), (b) and (c). It is observed that at the \nhighest input frequency of lkHz, the phase shift is less than \n30\u00b0, which is equivalent to a power factor of above 88% and \nis within the design specification. The control effort is also \nshown to lie within the design constraint of -39dB (or 0.01 l), \nFimre 9. \nf , 2  .................................. i ............................................................................ ~ . . .  .........................

CONCLUSIONS \nThe quality of the power utility, in terms of current \nharmonic content and power factor when supplying power \nelectronic converter loads, can be improved by the \napplication of active power filters. One of the primary issues \nof the system is the current tracking control, since ideally \nthere should be no phase and amplitude errors between the \nreference and output currents over a wide frequency range. \nThe paper has presented a new design methodology for robust \ncurrent tracking control, which is based on quantitative \nfeedback theory (QFT). The design requirements, in terms of \ntracking performance and disturbance rejection performance, \nhave been specified, and design problems, which stem from \nparametric uncertainty due to line filter parameter variations, \nconverter control over-modulation non-linearity, \nimperfections in the modulation algorithm, system output \ndisturbances due to current harmonics and system input \ndisturbances due to d.c. link voltage fluctuations, etc. have \nalso been addressed in the design methodology. The \nperformance attributes of the resulting controller have been \nverified by computer simulations, and the design has been \nshown to be superior to a \u2018classically\u2019 designed PI \ncompensation scheme with regard to robustness and current \ntracking. \n9653 \n"}
