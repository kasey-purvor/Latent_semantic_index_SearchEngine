In 1993, the prevalence of back \npain involved sixteen and a half million people in the United Kingdom; the annual \ncosts of back pain to the National Health Service were \u00a3480 million, whilst the costs \nof Department of Social Security benefits were estimated at \u00a31400 million (Clinical \nStandards Advisory Group, 1994). Since these data were reported further economic \nanalysis has revealed that the incidence is rising, and with it the associated costs. \nManiadakis and Gray (2000) proposed that in 1998, in the United Kingdom, the direct \nhealth care cost of back pain was \u00a31632 million and the cost of informal care and \nrelated production losses totalled \u00a310668 million. The prevalence appears to be \nincreasing and this may be associated with cultural changes that have influenced \npeople's awareness of more minor back symptoms and their willingness to report \nthem ( Palmer, Walsh, Bendall, Cooper, & Coggan, 2000) and the attitudes and \nbeliefs held by referring physicians ( Buchbinder, Jolley & Wyatt, 2001).  \nChronic low back pain is defined as pain within the lumbosacral region, buttocks and \nthighs that is \u2018mechanical\u2019 in nature: it varies with physical activity and varies with \ntime (Waddell, 1998). Additionally, it is seen to be pain that persists beyond twelve \nweeks ( Clinical Standards Advisory Group, 1994) or that lasts beyond the expected \nperiod of healing ( Andersson, 1999). However, as highlighted by Evans and Richards \n(1996) there is no standard or agreed definition of chronic low back pain and there \nremains continuing uncertainty and disagreement within the medical professions \nrelated to its cause, nature and treatment. This is problematic, not least because a \nfailure to reach consensus regarding the cause and nature of it can lead to \ninconsistencies in the advice and subsequent treatment that is given to individuals \nsuffering with low back pain. Such inconsistencies may also shape the beliefs held by \nthe sufferers in relation to their pain. Furthermore, aside from the physical sensation \nof pain, chronic low back pain is characterised by the impact that it has on the \nindividual's life. Associated anxiety, depression and stress are frequently cited as \nhaving an additional major impact on the lives of those who live with persistent low \nback pain ( Croft et al., 1995; Main, 1983; Sullivan, Reesor, Mikail, & Fisher, 1992; \nAverill, Novy, Nelson, & Berry, 1996). The presence of pain is seen as a symptom \nthat requires the help of a physician and may lead to the search for a cure as long as \nthe pain continues ( McCracken, 1998). Patients who are more obdurate in their \nattempts to avoid or rid themselves of pain, and consequently view pain as an absolute \nbarrier to a better life suffer more ill consequences. Those individuals who are \nunaccepting of their pain appear to be facing the distress that comes from attempting \nto control an unchangeable aversive experience ( Thompson, 1981).  \nDespite this emerging body of predominantly biomedical evidence that attempts to \nexplain or account for the continuance of pain, an equally valid perspective is \nproposed that challenges the \u2018dominant medico-scientific\u2019 approach (Williams & \nBendelow, 1998, p. 169) to the study of pain. This different point of view questions \nthe validity of the dominant dualist explanations provided to construe pain, whereby \n\u2018pain and meaning\u2019 ( Morris, 1991, p. 44) are viewed separately, when in fact they \nshould be seen as interdependent. Moreover, Morris (1991) suggested that when we \nbegin to explore the multiple meanings that can be assigned to the pain experience \nthese often prove to be \u2018at least as important as the medicines we consume\u2019 (p.44). \nThere is a clear need therefore, for the meanings that sufferers ascribe for their pain \nand beliefs relating to its cause to be explored.  \nBeliefs are assumptions about reality that serve as a perceptual lens or a \u2018set\u2019 through \nwhich events are interpreted (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). In relation to health and \nillness evidence attests to the differing beliefs that are held between the lay populace \nand the medical profession to account for the causes of wellness and disease ( \nHerzlich, 1973; Pill & Stott, 1982; Blaxter, 1982; Helman, 1984; Davison, Davey \nSmith, & Frankel, 1991). Early explanations to account for these differences centred \non the social psychological models of help-seeking behaviour and decision-making ( \nUehara, 2001) and the prominence of the mind-body dualism entrenched within the \ntraditional biomedical culture (see Ferguson & Marras, 1997). However, Williams \n(1984) suggests that lay theories of aetiology serve to \u2018reconstruct some sense of \norder from the fragmentation produced by illness\u2019 (p. 177) and in so doing common \nsense explanations of illness can be seen to develop to provide a vehicle to enable this \nreconstruction to occur. Peters, Stanley, Rose, and Salmon (1998) nevertheless \nsuggest that lay and medical beliefs are not separate systems and echo Shorter's \n(1992) view that medical accounts of common physical symptoms continually diffuse \ninto lay discourse about biology and illness. Low back pain is one such common \nphysical complaint where this diffusion is evident. However, it must be noted that \nthere are conceptual differences between lay knowledge (where lay people may have \nparticular insights into the phenomenon of low back pain) and the phenomenon \nspecific knowledge that patients or sufferers of low back pain have as a direct \nconsequence of their pain experience. Whilst both are equally valid it is the latter that \nplaces patients and sufferers in a unique position because of this insider knowledge ( \nArskey, 1994).  \nBeliefs regarding the cause of low back pain differ between individual sufferers and \nhealth care professionals (Cedraschi, Reust, Roux, & Vischer, 1992; Skelton, Murphy, \nMurphy, & O\u2019Dowd, 1995; Hermoni et al., 2000). Borkan, Reis, Hermoni, and \nBiderman (1995) found that individual sufferers articulated several factors to account \nfor their pain and these formed the basis for the beliefs that they held. The diversity of \nthese factors ranged from explanations that the presence of pain was due to: an injury; \ndegeneration of the spine; as a punishment; stress and the weather. Additionally, \nfactors such as \u2018work\u2019 \u2018ageing\u2019 and \u2018childhood injuries\u2019 (p.983) were seen to \nconstitute the primary causes of low back pain. More recent findings suggest that \nperceptions about the cause of low back pain being due to \u2018a slipped disc\u2019 or \u2018a \ntrapped nerve\u2019 are factually incorrect and may account for increased utilisation of \nprimary care services ( Moffett, Newbronner, Waddell, Croucher, & Spear, 2000). \nThis demonstrates the point highlighted by Shorter (1992) whereby medical \nterminology becomes ingrained into everyday lay language; one consequence of \nwhich is that a poor understanding of the pain symptoms may lead to the acquisition \nof maladaptive attitudes and behaviour in relation to the pain ( Geisser & Roth, 1998).  \nMethods that have been used to elicit the causal interpretation of social phenomena \nare varied and include semi-structured interviews (Antaki, 1985; Litton & Potter, \n1985) and spontaneous discourse ( Campbell & Muncer, 1987). Explication of beliefs \nand meaning regarding illness perception has previously occurred via an exploration \nof lived experience. Utilising patient narrative accounts Kleinman (1988) explored \nand mapped an explanatory lay model to elucidate how illness conditions were \nconceptualised and how these conceptualisations impacted on treatment choice, \ncompliance and outcome. Other research has shown how individuals perceive \nhypertension ( Greenfield, Borkan, & Yodfat, 1987) comprehend hip fracture ( \nBorkan, Quirk, & Sullivan, 1991) and make sense of everyday pain ( Aldrich & \nEccleston, 2000). Through direct questioning Underwood (1997) was able to \ndetermine patients\u2019 beliefs as to the cause of their low back pain. Whilst research \nevidence provides insight to the extent of lay knowledge, Furnham (1994) argues that \nthe structure and determinants of lay beliefs about health and illness are not \nconsidered. He contends that scrutiny is needed to understand those factors that are \npivotal to the construction of the meanings given. In support of this position Aldrich \nand Eccleston (2000) highlight the paucity of detailed work that describes how \nmeaning is created. One mechanism by which this can be achieved is through the \nexploration of causal attributions. Roesch and Weiner (2001) stated that attributions \nwere constructs worthy of consideration because they allowed an understanding of the \nworld as it had occurred in the past (both recent and distant) but they also served to \nguide future behaviour. One caveat to this approach is offered by Peterson and \nSeligman (1984) and Forsterling (1986) whom have highlighted the role that personal \nbiases may play in the (mis)interpretation of events. Russell (1998) however, has \nargued that the most fair and ethical approach to a consideration of health outcome is \nto use the perceptions of the service users as it places delivered care in the context of \npeople's expectations. It is within this context that condition-specific attributions \nshould be explored.  \nWhilst useful, these methods of inquiry are unable to categorically demonstrate \ndifferent weightings or levels of importance that individuals may assign to any given \nset of condition-specific causative determinants. Consequently certain factors may be \ndeemed as less important or irrelevant and this may not be elicited through the \nanalyses chosen. More recently however, network analysis has been utilised to \novercome some of these issues.  \nEarly network studies employed a grid method (see Fig. 1) to determine whether \nrespondents perceived there to be a link between causal factors in relation to one \ntarget variable (Litton & Potter (1985) and Heaven (1988); Heaven, 1994).  \n \n(5K)  \nFig. 1. Example of grid method.  \n Participants are presented with a grid in which the proposed causes of a social \nphenomenon (such as employment, loneliness or poverty) are presented vertically and \nhorizontally along the top and sides of a grid. Individual respondents are asked to \ndetermine whether there is a link between each of the factors. Agreement was \noriginally indicated by either a binary scale in which individuals enter a \u20181\u2019 if they \nperceive a link or a \u20180\u2019 if they do not (see Lunt, 1988; Campbell & Muncer, 1990; \nLunt & Livingstone, 1991; Muncer, Epro, Sidorowicz, & Campbell, 1992).  \nMore recent studies have tended to replace the binary form with a Likert scale in \nwhich participants rated the strength of a link on a scale of 1\u20135 (see Lunt, 1991; \nHeaven, 1994). Individual grids are then aggregated and networks constructed \nhierarchically with the strongest link entered first. Network construction stops \naccording to a cause-to-link ratio calculation in which new links are added to the \nnetwork provided that this does not entail adding a large number of other causal links \nfrom causes that already appear on the network.  \nCriticisms of this method centre on the fact that the resulting networks are not the \nproduction of any one individual but instead represent an aggregated response format \n(Muncer & Gillen, 1997). They are often, therefore, not representative of what \nparticipants perceive as the causal links and generally produce larger networks with \nmore causal links than are perceived by any one participant ( Muncer & Gillen, 1997). \nAdditionally, the grid method requires respondents to consider possible links between \ncauses that may account for the target variable (e.g., loneliness) rather than direct \nlinks between the causes and the target variable. It has subsequently been found on \nmany occasions that the direct links between the causes and the target are often \nconsidered more important than the links between causes ( Heffernan, Green, \nMcManus, & Muncer, 1998; Muncer, Taylor, & Ling, 2001b). Furthermore, a target \nfactor may have reciprocal causal links with the nominated causes. In a recent \nnetwork study of the causes of health and illness, participants\u2019 representations \nsuggested that stress was an important cause of illness and that illness was an \nimportant cause of stress ( Muncer et al., 2001b). Preventing individuals from \nrepresenting direct paths (as in the earlier grid method) may yield an over complex \nrepresentation on the one hand (see, for instance, the representation elicited in Lunt, \n1991), as individuals seek to encode their perceptions within the constraints of \nproposed causes, and, on the other hand, it may limit the subtlety of the representation \nby precluding the representation of connections to the target factor that are both direct \nand indirect from a given causal factor. Likewise, there is no place within the grid \nmethod for free choice by respondents to include factors that they may perceive as \nrelevant but are not included within the framework of the grid. The diagram method \n(see Fig. 2) proposed by Green and McManus (1995) circumvents these issues.  \n \n(3K)  \nFig. 2. Example of diagram method.  \n Green and McManus (1995) required individuals to draw a network diagram of the \nrisk factors for a target factor, coronary heart disease. Unlike previous network \nelicitation studies, individuals were not forced to consider each and every connection \namongst the factors but were free to sample as they wished. Individuals represented a \ncausal relationship between two factors by drawing a line connecting them and \nindicated the direction of the causal influence using an arrowhead. Also in contrast to \nprevious studies, the target factor (coronary heart disease) was explicitly represented. \nIn the diagrams created, a possible causal factor may be connected to the target factor \nin a variety of ways. A causal factor may have a direct path to the target factor, or it \nmay have an indirect path to it via some other factor, or it may have both a direct path \nand an indirect path to the target factor. The diagram represents what individuals \nspontaneously consider the critical pathways.  \nIn addition to representing a path, individuals were required to rate the strength of \neach causal path on a scale from zero to one hundred. A composite diagram was \nconstructed that indicated both the percentage of individuals including each causal \npath and the mean strength of those causal paths. Green and McManus (1995) showed \nthat the total path strength of a factor (the strength of both direct paths and all indirect \npaths) predicted participants\u2019 ratings of the effectiveness of different actions based on \neach of the risk factors in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease.  \nIn a subsequent study that examined perceptions of the factors increasing a person's \nprospects of employment, Green, McManus, and Derrick (1998) confirmed the \nimportance of path strengths in predicting the ratings of the effectiveness of different \nactions designed to increase a person's employment prospects. Muncer, Taylor, \nGreen, and McManus (2001a) have also used the diagram drawing method to \ninvestigate nurses\u2019 representations of the causes of work-related stress. In this study \nthey also investigated the reliability and validity of the resulting networks by \ncomparing the network produced with that produced from a previous network study \nand also with the findings of a large-scale study of stress in the National Health \nService ( Haynes, Wall, Boplden, Stride, & Rick, 1999). In the latter case, the pattern \nof correlation between the nine dimensions of the causes matched many of the \nfeatures of the network diagram.  \nWithin the diagram method of network construction individuals are presented with a \nlist containing factors that may cause the target variable but additionally there is \nopportunity to incorporate other factors that the respondent may feel is personally \nrelevant. Individual respondents are required to draw a line to represent the link \nbetween the causal factor and the target variable. They are also required to indicate \nthe strength of this cause by providing a value from, for example, 0 to 100 (Green et \nal., 1998). Of particular relevance to these network studies is that to date, the majority \nhave utilised samples of participants that are comprised of undergraduate students. As \na result, these studies, whilst demonstrating the efficacy of the methodology, may be \nproblematic due to the elicitation of causal attributions to social phenomena from \nindividuals who do not perceive the target variable to be personally relevant at the \ntime of grid construction (e.g., loneliness). The exception to this are the studies which \nexplored factors that were perceived to be contributory to work-based stress in nurses \nand utilised a sample consistent with the research aim ( Taylor, White, & Muncer, \n1999; Muncer, Epro, Sidorowicz, & Campbell (1992) and Muncer, Taylor, Green, and \nMcManus (2001a)). It could be argued therefore, that personally experienced \nphenomena would hold a different meaning in comparison to those who are asked to \nconsider an abstract or personally meaningless concept and consequently this may \nimpact on the network that is derived.  \nNo studies to date have utilised network analysis to elicit those factors that low back \npain sufferers perceive cause low back pain. This research is important for two \nreasons. Firstly, it is needed to develop our understanding of the complexities inherent \nin the casual attributions sufferers make to account for their pain. Secondly, it may \nprovide additional evidence to support claims made by Moffet et al. (2000) that \nperceived causes that are factually incorrect may lead to greater utilisation of health \ncare services.  \nMethod \nParticipants \nTwo hundred and thirty four low back pain sufferers comprised the initial sample \npool. These patients were recruited as part of a larger study exploring expectations of \nlow back pain treatment. Consecutive patients referred to two North East of England \nSpinal Assessment Clinics and two North East of England Pain Clinics comprised the \nstudy participants. One element of this larger study required individuals to indicate \nwhat they believed the cause of their back pain to be. One hundred and eleven \nparticipants failed to provide an answer or stated that they didn\u2019t know (77 and 34, \nrespectively). The remaining 123 participants provided 18 different reasons to account \nfor the cause of their pain (Table 1). There were no statistically significant differences \nin relation to age, gender or duration of pain between those participants who did \nprovide a cause and those who did not.  \n \nTable 1. Eighteen causes of low back pain identified from original sample  \n \n \nThe 123 participants were asked to participate further by completing a network \ndiagram. Seventy-one completed diagrams (57.7%) were submitted for analyses. \nAgain, no statistically significant differences were found in relation to age, gender or \nduration of pain between those participants who provided a diagram and those who \ndid not. Ages of participants ranged from 18 to 83 (mean 45.24) and there were 31 \nmales and 40 females.  \nDesign \nAll 71 participants constructed a single diagram indicating the causes that they \nperceived to be related to low back pain.  \nProcedure \nIndividuals providing a reason to account for low back pain were asked to participate \nin the network study. From the original eighteen causes (Table 1) that were identified \nfifteen were selected to be included within the instructions to participants. The \nremaining three causes (wear and tear, not enough rest and specific movements when \nworking) were omitted as we perceived these to be either too general or were specific \nto participants who were working. It was also felt that as the diagram method enables \nparticipants to include any perceived causes of their low back pain within their \nnetworks that the omission of the three causes from the list would not impact on the \nderived networks. Participants were therefore provided with an A4 piece of paper. \nPlaced in the centre of the paper were the words LOW BACK PAIN. Above this were \nthe following instructions:  \nThere are many reasons why people develop low back pain. Possible causes are: \nsciatica, trapped nerves, arthritis, an injury, lifting and carrying, driving or being in a \ncar, stress, disc problems, no painkillers, lying down, weak muscles, joint problems, \nstanding, sitting and walking.  \nWrite down the causes from the list that you think cause back pain. You can also add \nany other causes that you think of. Also give the cause a number from 1 to 100 to \nshow how strong you think that cause is. 1=a weak link, 100=a very strong link.  \nParticipants were also given an example of a previous drawn diagram featuring causes \nof coronary heart disease. Each participant constructed the diagram individually. After \ncompletion, participants were thanked and provided with information detailing how \ntheir completed diagram would be collated with those provided by other low back \nsufferers to produce an overall model of the related causes of low back pain.  \nResults \nA composite diagram was prepared by examining the separate paths between any two \nfactors for each of the 71 participants. Participants produced mainly direct paths \nbetween the causes and the target back pain, with only 35.8% of participants \nincluding indirect causal paths between causes. The mean number of direct causal \npaths was 5.61 with a standard deviation of 3.25 and the mean number of indirect \ncausal links was 1.16 with a standard deviation of 2.34. Causal paths that were \nendorsed by at least 10 per cent of participants (Green & McManus, 1995) are listed \nin Table 2.  \n \nTable 2. Paths proposed by at least 10% of participants, with mean path strength  \n \n \nDisc problems, lifting and carrying, sciatica and injury are included on at least 50 per \ncent of participants\u2019 diagrams. Lifting and carrying to injury is the only indirect path \nthat meets the 10% criterion.  \nFig. 3 shows the composite diagram from all causes. The various proportions of \nindividuals (10\u201329%, 30\u201349%, 50\u2013100%) who included a particular path are shown \nby lines of different types.  \n \n(20K)  \nFig. 3. Composite network diagram of the perceived causal paths of low back pain. Only paths drawn \nby more than 10 per cent of participants are represented.  \n \nWe also calculated for each path its mean strength, using the scores given by those \nwho included it. The mean strength of each path is represented by different line \nwidths. Thus we are able to separate path frequency, which is the proportion of \nparticipants who included a particular path, and path strength. Participants in this \nstudy did not include any reciprocal paths from back pain to any of the causes.  \nThe most frequently included paths in this network also have high path strengths of \nover 70. The correlation between path frequency and path strength is also significant \n(r=0.76, p=0.001). It is noteworthy however, that the indirect path between lifting and \ncarrying and injury has quite a high path strength (over 60) even though it has low \npath frequency.  \nPrevious work has already gone some way towards establishing both the reliability \nand validity of models derived from network analysis (Green & McManus, 1995; \nHeffernan et al., 1998; Muncer, Epro, Sidorowicz, & Campbell (1992) and Muncer, \nTaylor, Green, and McManus (2001a)). We can provide a weak check on the \nreliability by randomly splitting the sample in two and comparing the two groups for \npath inclusion. In this case two randomly selected groups were not significantly \ndifferent (p>0.05) for frequency of inclusion of any path appearing on the diagram in \nFig. 3.  \nContent analysis \nIn addition to the elicitation of the main causative pathways, quantitative content \nanalysis was performed on the other causes that individual sufferers perceived also \ncontributed to the cause of their low back pain. Twenty-seven participants provided a \ntotal of 33 responses that account for 16 other causes of low back pain. These are \nshown in Table 3.  \n \nTable 3. Additional factors provided to account for low back pain  \n \n \nSimilar to the main causes that were extracted via the network analysis, the related \nperceived causes of low back pain were attributed to either a physical condition or a \nspecific person centred factor. Of these 16 additional causes, 7 are physical\/exercise \nrelated (posture, gardening, lack of exercise, sport, back spasm, caring for a sick \nrelative and poor self care), 4 are related to the female reproductive system \n(painful\/heavy menstruation, pregnancy and childbirth, due to hysterectomy and \nmenopause) and 2 causes are related to diet (being overweight and unhealthy diet). \nThe remaining three causes (as a consequence of a related disease, hereditary factors, \nside-effect of other medication) can be seen to be distal to the other thirteen, insofar as \nthey reflect factors outside of the control of the individual.  \nDiscussion \nThe findings from this study have shown that sufferers did not have an overtly \ncomplex view of the causative factors of low back pain but were able to define four \ncore (high consensus 50% consensus) contributory causes of low back pain (disc, \nsciatica, lifting, and injury) and one indirect pathway between lifting and injury. \nMoreover, the total number of pathways that were generated (n=16) reflects the \ninherent difficulties found in clinical practice in providing a concise diagnosis for pain \narising in the lumbar region. Furthermore, there was a clear delineation between \nexternal (biomedical) and internal (person-related) factors that were attributed to low \nback pain acquisition. Likewise, content analysis of the additional causes provided by \nparticipants produced a further sixteen factors that reflected this dualism.  \nIn the data presented by Borkan, Reis, Hermoni, and Biderman (1995) participant \naccounts also reflected these distinctions. They cited features of their pain that were \nperceived to be of neurological origin (e.g., disc problems, muscle weakness) or of a \nmechanical nature (e.g., due to sitting, standing, lifting and driving) or due to \npsychosocial factors (e.g., stress). Female participants also reported that back pain \nwas attributed to pregnancy and childbirth. Such explanatory models, derived via \nqualitative methodologies, certainly add to our understanding of the lived experience \nof low back pain, but they do not establish the level of consensus amongst the \nsufferers in relation to the attribution of the cause of low back pain. The findings from \nour network study therefore, complement and extend those described by Borkan et al. \n(1995). The use of the diagram approach employed in this network study has enabled \nthe complexities of the causal attributions made by these low back pain sufferers to be \nrevealed. Participants have assigned their own weighting to the factors that they \nattributed to be the cause of their pain and as a consequence the strength of the \nconsensus regarding the causes of low back pain have been found. Moreover, this \napproach has afforded insight into the consensual causal determinants of low back \npain that would be difficult to achieve using any of the commonly used methods (see \nfor example Antaki, 1985; Campbell & Muncer, 1987; Litton & Potter, 1985 \ndiscussed above) and this needs to be considered for future research where the \nelicitation of causal attributions in relation to pain and illness is to be determined.  \nWhilst other previous research (Moffet et al, 2000) has shown that low back pain \nsufferers do use biomedical terminology when describing their pain problems and \nwhen recounting the cause of their problem, our findings have revealed the subtleties \nwithin such terminological use. As Table 2 shows, of the six pathways with greatest \npath strength ( 70), four are described using medical terminology. Of these, \nparticipants have distinguished between causal attributions that are due to nerves, \nsciatica and discs. This use of biomedical terminology within the everyday language \nof these participants suggests that contrary to Geisser and Roth (1998) individuals \nwithin our sample appear to demonstrate a good understanding of their pain \nsymptoms and are able to attribute these symptoms to simple diagnostic criterion. \nWhilst the use of such terminology may be factually incorrect and\/or inappropriately \nused Stacey (1988) suggested that \"people's ideas are logical and valid in their own \nright, although they may not be consonant with biomedical science or with any other \norganised healing system\" (p.142). Chapple, Campbell, Rogers, and Roland (2002) \nalso suggest that lay and medical knowledge are not discrete entities and that there is \nlikely to be a certain degree of overlap between the two. Arskey (1994) proposes that \npatients are placed in a unique position, as they possess practical experience and \ninsider knowledge of their condition. It can be argued therefore, that this privileged \nknowledge is then used for the active development of a lexicon that embraces the \nbiomedical terminology to create meaning. This \u2018socialised processing\u2019 ( Hewstone, \n1983, p.11) of information is mediated via language-based communications to enable \nindividuals to learn about causes and adopt specific hypotheses about the cause of \ntheir pain. Furthermore, as our findings revealed so many direct causal pathways for \nlow back pain, this would appear to support Weiner (1985) who suggested that \nindividuals who actively seek the causes of outcomes might subsequently adapt more \npositively to that outcome. However, the separation between external (biomedical) \nand internal (person-related) causal attributions may also reflect one method by which \nindividuals have attempted to make sense of their pain and instead may be indicative \nof maladaptive coping. This can only be alluded to however, as this was not directly \nconsidered within this study.  \nResearch on social action suggests that individuals who believe that events are related \nto their own behaviours are more likely than individuals trusting fate or powers \nbeyond their control to take steps to change health behaviours. Phares (1976) \nproposed that the cognitive and motivational aspects of the internal-external \ndimension leads those individuals who have an internal orientation to a superior \nposition in exerting power and control over their environment. If this is the case, then \nsuch distinct internal-external causal attributions may have a significant impact in \nrelation to health maintenance and health service use. May, Rose, and Johnstone \n(2000) also suggest that lay models highlight the relationship that sufferers have with \ntheir pain and as such they may be predictive of the outcome of treatment. The \nnetworks produced in this study and presented in the composite diagram ( Fig. 3) \nrepresent such a lay model. Over half of the direct paths were attributed to \nexternal\/biomedical factors and these were also the pathways that were most heavily \nendorsed. This may reflect the needs of the individuals within this sample to have a \ndiagnosis for their physical pain\u2014to attach a meaningful label to their symptoms that \nlegitimates their pain. Glenton (2003) has argued that such \"achievement of disease\" \n(p. 2250) can release the individual from personal responsibility for the pain and \nenable the individual to assume a sick role position. However, caution must be \napplied here as six direct pathways were also attributed to internal or person-centred \nfactors, albeit with lower path strength.  \nThe six internal or person-centred causal attributions all relate to activities that are \nundertaken as part of everyday living and suggest that participants have an awareness \nof the role that mechanical loads play in both the genesis and maintenance of low \nback pain. The fact that the only indirect pathway is between lifting and injury further \nsupports this. Eight individuals endorsed this indirect pathway however forty \nparticipants included a direct pathway of lifting within their diagrams. We do not \nknow whether forty individuals have attributed lifting a load leads to an injury that in \nturn leads to back pain yet have not articulated this middle stage in their diagram, nor \ndo we know whether forty individuals believe that after lifting a load no injury needs \nto transpire for back pain to occur. This failing of the methodology to enable the exact \nmeaning of participants\u2019 diagrams to be elicited is problematic. Whilst the pathways \ndemonstrate the consensus of causal attribution the explicit meaning of what exactly \nthe pathways represent remains elusive.  \nAnother limitation with this method is that the fifteen direct pathways derived from \nparticipant diagrams reflect the fifteen examples provided in the instructions to \nparticipants. This suggests one of two things. Either the participants were primed in \ntheir diagram construction by this list of possible causes resulting in the production of \nan unrepresentative model, or that the list of causes, derived as it was from \nparticipants in the larger study, truly reflect the causal attributions of individuals with \nlow back pain. The latter is more likely as each of the 71 participants who produced \nnetwork diagrams also provided data from which the original list was derived. \nBecause of this the resulting composite network produced by the participants should \nbe seen as representative of the causal attributions of this sample. Furthermore, as 27 \nparticipants did include a total of sixteen other specific causes beyond those included \nin the list, suggests that individuals were able to construct a diagram utilising other \ncauses that were not included within the instructions. It is interesting to note however, \nthat the three omitted causes (wear and tear, not enough rest and specific movements \nwhen working) did not appear in any of the networks produced here. One possible \nreason to account for this could be that those participants who provided these causes \nfor pain from the original study did not later complete network diagrams.  \nIt must also be acknowledged that the composite network was produced from \nresponses from just over half of the participants who provided a cause for their pain in \nthe initial stages of the study. Despite this, a satisfactory response rate resulted. The \nsample was purposive, that is, all participants were individuals who suffered with \nback pain. This is an important point as many of the reported network studies (see \nGreen & McManus, 1995; Green et al., 1998; French, Marteau, Senior, & Weinman, \n2002) utilise samples that include individuals who do not have any personal \nexperience of the phenomenon being studied and consequently the resulting networks \ntend to be complex. The high number of direct pathways and low number of indirect \npathways that were generated in our study suggests that when the sample includes \nindividuals with direct personal experience a more direct and consequently less \ncomplex model emerges. This has implications for the management of low back pain. \nClearly individuals who attribute their pain to an external cause will require a \ndifferent treatment approach initially, compared to their counterparts who attribute \npain to causes within their own control. High dropout and relapse rates ( Kerns & \nHaythornthwaite, 1988; Turk & Rudy, 1990, 1991; Richmond & Carmody, 1999) \nfollowing psychological treatment programmes are disconcerting and Kerns and \nRosenberg (2000) suggest that \u2018efforts to identify individuals prone to these negative \noutcomes\u2019 (p. 49) should be pursued. The differential attributions found within this \nstudy may provide one method by which such individuals may become known.  \nAllied to this, there is a need to ascertain whether health care utilisation and treatment \noutcome differs between individuals premised on these causal attributions. By \ndetermining the causal attributions that low back pain sufferers make regarding their \npain, treatment packages could be tailored to address inaccuracies or biases in \nthinking. This may be particularly useful for those individuals who attribute their pain \nas a consequence of external (or biomedical) causes. Finally, with the prevalence of \nlow back pain increasing and with patient expectations near ungovernable (Pickering, \n1996) there is a clear need to set treatment boundaries and likely outcomes within the \nframe of reference of the individual sufferer. There is a need therefore to determine \nwhether the causal attributions produced by patients are synonymous with those of the \ndoctors\/health practitioners to whom they consult. Elicitation of the causal attributions \nmade by these health professionals is needed for two reasons: primarily, as there is \nlittle agreement within the medical professions related to the cause, nature and \ntreatment of chronic low back pain it would be useful to have information concerning \nconsensual causal attributions for low back pain from this group of people and \nsecondly, to determine whether the variations in patient attributions reflect possible \ndifferences in the information received from different doctors.  \nThere is an opportunity here to use network analysis methodology to identify \nconsensual patient and practitioner data and this could be achieved beyond the \nspecific study of chronic low back pain. Research that examines the causal \nattributions made by people who experience pain and illness is unable to demonstrate \nwhich of the identified causes are assigned greater importance by sufferers and tend to \nmerely uncover a broad range of potential determinants that provides little insight into \nthose that are deemed most important or of greatest relevance. However, if the \ndiagram method considered here were to be used across a range of illness or pain or \npoor health states (e.g., breast cancer, arthritis or obesity) then more meaningful and \nconsensual data would be produced. On the basis of such data, personally relevant \ntreatment packages and cause-specific educational material could be produced. If this \nwere to prove effective this may lead to improved outcomes, improved patient \nsatisfaction with delivered care and potentially an overall reduction in health care \nutilisation.  \nConclusion \nThis network analysis has revealed the complexities, subtleties and consensus of the \ncausal attributions made by low back pain sufferers. This is the first study, to our \nknowledge, to utilise this method with individuals who have chronic low back pain \nand it has shown that the individuals within our sample have a good understanding of \ntheir pain symptoms and are able to attribute these to simple diagnostic criterion. \nUtilisation of the diagram method with a sample that has personal experience of the \nphenomenon under investigation has shown that direct causes are more readily \nattributed rather than indirect, and individuals tend to differentiate these causes \nbetween external and internal factors. Identification of the causal attributions made by \nhealth professionals to account for low back pain, in comparison with those of low \nback pain sufferers, may highlight potential misconceptions from either party and \ncould lead to tailored treatment packages being developed. In so doing this may \nprovide one possible way to stem the increasing prevalence of low back pain.  \n \n \nReferences \nAldrich, S. and Eccleston, C., 2000. Making sense of everyday pain.
