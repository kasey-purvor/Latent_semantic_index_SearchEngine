Amid concerns about the political impact of religious revivalism, little attention has been devoted to their economic implications. Focusing on the remarkable coincidence between the withdrawal of the state, the rise of religious movements, and the dramatic expansion of the informal economy, this paper examines the role of religious revivalism in processes of informal economic governance and class formation in contemporary Africa. Against the background of the historical role of religion in the development of market institutions across the continent, it traces the dynamics of religious revivalism and informal economic regulation in two regions of Nigeria.

In the past three decades, Christian revivalism has\ngrown from a handful of charismatic churches to over 10,000 pente-\ncostalist churches and groups across Africa (Gifford 1998; Ojo 2005: 397).\nThis religious awakening has fostered an expansion of global religious\nnetworks linking African churches to pentecostalist groups in the United\nStates and Europe. Over the same period, reformist Islamic movements\nhave begun to develop mass followings in East and West Africa (Loimeier\n2005; Menkhaus 2002; Villalon 1999), amid growing cultural and financial\nlinkages between African Islamic activists and Saudi Arabia, the Gulf\nStates, Libya and Iran. With the rise of international concern about the\n\u2018clash of civilisations \u2019, these developments have raised new questions\nabout the relationship between globalisation, religion and politics in\nAfrica.\nMuch less attention has been devoted to the economic dimensions of\nthis process, which have significant, but distinct, implications for our\nunderstanding of political change in contemporary Africa. As David\nMaxwell (1998: 350) noted in an incisive article on pentecostalism in\nZimbabwe: \u2018 the debate, deriving fromMaxWeber \u2026 over how much the\nProtestant ethic influenced, and was influenced by, the spirit of capi-\ntalism \u2026 hardly engages at all with the third wave of Pentecostalist\nProtestantism\u2019. He points out that studies of pentecostalism have tended to\nfocus on their contribution to democracy or civil society, while ignoring\nthe critical economic dimension of their influence on social and political\nmobilisation: \u2018The growing influence of what is known as the \u2018\u2018prosperity\ngospel \u2019\u2019 has implications for both the formation of capitalist attitudes and\nactivities, and for shaping political activism.\u2019 A recent issue of The Review of\nAfrican Political Economy on religion in contemporary Africa hints at the role\nof new religious movements in class formation and challenges to failed\nauthority, and finds evidence of protestant as well as patrimonial and\noccultist ethics in various parts of Africa (see articles by Hasu 2006; Ifeka\n2006; Love 2006; Obadare 2006). Studies of West Africa have noted\na significant economic dimension in recent Islamic movements, which\nencourage new ethics of frugality and educational attainment in the face of\neconomic crisis and state withdrawal (Babou 2002; Labazee 1995; Villalon\n1999). Already in the mid 1990s, Pascale Labaze\u00b4e (1995: 150) noted that the\nnew anti-Sufi Islamic movements in Nigeria, Niger and Senegal propa-\ngated an ethic of parsimony which is distinct from the redistributive ethic\nof Sufism, and addresses the needs of lower-middle-class groups and small\ntraders struggling with falling real incomes and narrow trading margins.\nEllis and ter Haar (2004b: 11) have remarked in passing that Christian and\nIslamic religious networks also play a central role in the expansion of\n398 KATE MEAGHER\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nglobal remittances to Africa. Despite these various indications of the\neconomic significance of contemporary African religious movements,\nthe implications of these processes for emerging forms of governance on\nthe continent have not been systematically explored.\nThe result has been a lack of serious attention to the remarkable co-\nincidence between the withdrawal of the state, the proliferation of religious\nmovements, and the dramatic expansion of the informal economy.\nWeakened states and crumbling formal institutions have triggered an ex-\nplosion of informal economic activity across Africa. By the turn of the\nmillennium, World Bank and ILO sources put Africa\u2019s informal economy\nat 42% of GDP, 78% of the non-agricultural labour force, and 93% of\nnew employment, giving Africa the dubious distinction of being the most\ninformalised region in the world (Schneider 2002; ILO 2002). This not\nonly makes informal actors an important political constituency in the era\nof democratisation, but raises important questions about the alternative\nforms of governance through which this enormous informal economy fills\nthe regulatory gaps left by contracting, and in some cases collapsing,\nstates. As Linda Weiss (1987) pointed out in another context, informal\neconomies are not sites of atomistic entrepreneurship; they require net-\nworks of social relations for mobilising labour, credit and trust. While\nethnicity has played a prominent role in organising African informal\neconomies, religion has, historically and in contemporary times, also been\na critical factor in the organisation of reliable economic networks outside\nthe framework of the state.\nThis paper explores the role of religious movements in informal econ-\nomic governance in two different regions of Nigeria. The analysis focuses\non an informal textile cluster in the Muslim Yoruba city of Ilorin in south-\nwestern Nigeria, and informal shoe and garment manufacturing clusters\nin the Christian Igbo city of Aba in south-eastern Nigeria. Located on\nopposite sides of the country\u2019s major religious as well as ethnic divides,\nthese informal enterprise clusters provide an opportunity to examine how\nreligious movements shape economic strategies and processes of class and\nidentity formation outside the bounds of state regulation. The empirical\nmaterial presented here is a product of field research conducted in Aba\nin 1999\u20132000, with subsequent visits in 2001 and 2005; and in Ilorin in\n2004\u20135. Statistical information is based on a survey of 132 shoe and gar-\nment producers and 60 weavers, supplemented by more than 80 in-depth\ninterviews with informal producers, leaders of informal enterprise associ-\nations, and local government officials.\nThe paper begins with a brief examination of the literature on the\neconomic role of religious movements in Africa, with attention to debates\nR E L I G I OU S MOVEMENT S A ND E CONOM I C GOV ERN ANC E 399\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nabout the implications of religious revivalism for promoting or trans-\nforming patrimonialism and magical forms of accumulation. Focusing on\nthe role of religious movements from the late colonial period as well as in\ncontemporary times, I then trace the implications of conversion to new\nreligious sects for shaping alternative ethics of economic conduct, new\nincreasingly global business and marketing networks, and new social ten-\nsions. I argue, against some of the prevailing literature, that religious\nmovements in contemporary Africa are not primarily a return to occultist\nor patrimonial impulses, but have also fostered productive economic tend-\nencies within society. While patrimonial strategies and occultist behaviour\nexist, religious conversion among Nigerian informal artisans reveals a\nstrong modernising and anti-patrimonial ethic based on social advance-\nment through education, skills and legitimate rather than illicit access to\nthe power and resources of the state. While a progressive trajectory of\nreligious governance is emerging within the informal economy, this is\nbeing stunted rather than unleashed by the relentless pressures of liberal-\nisation, globalisation and the realities of democratisation in conditions of\neconomic austerity. In short, neo-liberal economic and political reforms,\nrather than African culture, are undermining the spirit of capitalism in\nAfrican societies.\nU N V E I L I N G T H E I N V I S I B L E : R E L I G I O U S N E T W O R K S\nA N D E C O N O M I C C H A N G E I N A F R I C A\nEven a cursory look at the informal economy in contemporary Africa\nmakes it clear that religion plays a significant role in the emergence of\nnew forms of economic order in the context of state decline. Somalia has\nplayed host to an \u2018economy without a state \u2019 for nearly two decades,\nheavily supported by flows of remittances, trade and investment through\nIslamic hawala networks centred in Dubai (Lindley 2005; Little 2003). In\nsimilar fashion, the Islamic trading networks of the Mouride brotherhoods\nof Senegal and the Hausa of Nigeria have responded to economic crisis at\nhome by globalising their activities, creating transnational trading linkages\nthat stretch to North America, Europe, the Gulf States and East Asia, as\nwell as informal remittance flows that are now outstripping the value of\nforeign aid in the countries concerned (Babou 2002; Dahou & Fouchard\nforthcoming; Ebin 1993; Meagher 2003). A recent IFAD report (2007)\nshows that remittance flows to Africa exceed US$38 billion, much of it\nthrough informal channels, amounting to nearly twice the value of current\naid flows to the continent. Globalising pentecostal Christian networks also\nplay an increasing role in generating new economic opportunities outside\n400 KATE MEAGHER\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nthe framework of the state. From Zimbabwe to Ghana, growing linkages\nbetween African churches and pentecostal communities in the USA and\nUK have supported social welfare networks as well as access to resources,\nvisas, and educational opportunities (Dahou & Fouchard forthcoming;\nGifford 1998; Marshall 1998; Mary 2002). As Ellis and ter Haar (1998:\n193) recognise, \u2018 religious movements are rarely devoid of political im-\nplications and \u2026 when they do emerge in a country where the state is\nunable to fulfil its expected functions in regard to the law and public order,\nreligion can take on a specific importance\u2019.\nEvidence of the positive effects of African informal economic and re-\nligious networks on entrepreneurship and accumulation challenges con-\ntemporary representations of African informal economies as shadowy\nforms of governance steeped in patrimonialism, corruption and super-\nstitious belief. The recent expansion of informal economies and religious\nmovements has triggered alarm among many social scientists of contem-\nporary Africa, who appear to share a Weberian mistrust of particularistic\nties and networks which are seen as destructive of rational economic and\npolitical order. In the political economy of informal governance, efforts to\ngrasp the regulatory implications of globalisation, economic informa-\nlisation and religious revivalism have tended to focus more on witchcraft\nand human sacrifice than on more conventional religious movements.\nReferences to \u2018occult economies \u2019, \u2018 shadow governances\u2019 and a cultural\nfascination with \u2018 the invisible \u2019 associate African spiritual impulses with an\nanti-Weberian ethic that undermines rather than promotes productive\neconomic change (Bayart 1999, 2005; Chabal & Daloz 1999, 2006;\nComaroff & Comaroff 1999; Ellis & ter Haar 2004a). According to Jean\nand John Comaroff (1999: 289), religious revival in Africa and African\ndiaspora societies involves\nan expansion both in techniques of producing value and in the meaning of\nwealth itself. It is an expansion that often breaks the conventional bounds of\nlegality, making crime, as well as magic, a mode of production open to those who\nlack other resources. This is why violence, as an instrument of income redistri-\nbution, is such a ubiquitous feature of postcolonial economies, in Africa and\nbeyond.\nSimilarly, Ellis and ter Haar (2004a) link the production of wealth in\ncontemporary Africa with occult practices, while Jean-Francois Bayart\n(1999: 34) argues that, far from fostering the spirit of capitalism, \u2018 the\n\u2018\u2018 social capital \u2019\u2019 of Africa appears to display a marked affinity with the\nspirit of criminality \u2019.\nWhile efforts are made to emphasise the modernity of these spiritual\ntendencies as responses to global capitalism rather than a reversion to\nR E L I G I OU S MOVEMENT S A ND E CONOM I C GOV ERN ANC E 401\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nprimordial practices, such representations of indigenous mechanisms of\neconomic governance tend to crowd out more progressive and mundane\nreligious responses to global capitalism and economic hardship. As\nTerence Ranger (2004) observes in a review of Ellis and ter Haar\u2019s Worlds\nof Power, \u2018an account which has too much to say about witchcraft, or about\nhuman sacrifice, or trade in body parts and Satanism cannot help but be\nan unrepresentative and distorting account \u2019. Such accounts have tended\nto distract attention from more constructive tendencies of African religious\nmovements, involving new forms of solidarity, entrepreneurial networks\nand productive institutional innovation, which play at least as prominent a\nrole as witchcraft in contemporary spiritual responses to liberalisation\nacross the continent.\nFor a more balanced account, one must look beyond the literature on\nthe political economy of informal governance, to a more varied literature\non the role of new Christian and Islamic movements in the ravaged\nregulatory terrain of contemporary African societies. Studies of Islamic as\nwell as Christian religious networks highlight their role in introducing\nstrict moral norms, a range of efficient commercial institutions, and a\ntendency to operate across communal and class boundaries, contributing\nto processes of accumulation and social cohesion in a context of intense\nhardship and social disruption. Studies of Nigeria, Tanzania and\nZimbabwe emphasise the role of pentecostal movements in fostering new\nethics of piety, frugality and responsibility that \u2018provide a pattern for\ncoming to terms with, and benefiting from, modernities \u2019 dominant values\nand institutions\u2019 (Maxwell 1998: 351). Far from fostering a slide into the\noccult, pentecostal churches focus on disembedding believers from\nthe spiritual and economic pressures of communal obligations, and re-\nembedding them in an ethic described by Ruth Marshall (1998: 282) as \u2018a\ndoctrine of morally-controlled materialism\u2019. In a compelling account of\nZimbabwe\u2019s Assemblies of God Church (ZAOGA), David Maxwell (1998:\n353) details the specific institutional processes through which believers are\n\u2018re-socialised\u2019 into a church society that emphasises literacy, moral prob-\nity and industriousness, reintegrating the volatile category of urban youth\ninto productive forms of social engagement : \u2018This re-socialisation makes\nthe born-again believer more industrious and socially mobile than many\nof their unsaved neighbours \u2026 \u2019. Through the \u2018doctrine of talents \u2019, the\nchurch also promotes a local culture of small-scale entrepreneurship\namong women through a skills-training and credit system reminiscent of\nindigenous apprenticeship systems of West Africa. Matthews Ojo (2005)\nand others note the role of West African pentecostal churches in setting up\nsocial welfare networks, sponsoring educational or business activities, and\n402 KATE MEAGHER\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nlinking church members into international networks of solidarity and ad-\nvancement (Fouchard et al. 2005; Gifford 1998).\nThe available evidence indicates that reformist Islamic movements have\na similar orientation to personal advancement and \u2018the remoralisation of\npublic life \u2019 (Fouchard et al. 2005: 344). In Senegal, Villalon (1999) explores\nthe role of new Islamic movements in constructively channelling the social\nand political energies of disaffected urban youth. Similarly, the reformist\nIzala movement of northern Nigeria promoted an ethic of frugality and\neconomic advancement through an emphasis on education, modesty and\nminimal ceremonial expenditure, which appealed strongly to northern\nNigerian artisans, small traders and aspiring middle classes hard-hit by the\ndepredations of structural adjustment (Kane 2003; Labazee 1995). In\nSomalia, Islamic courts played a central role in the rebuilding of law and\norder before the Ethiopian invasion, and were widely supported by a local\nbusiness community anxious for a return to security and predictability\n(Bradbury et al. 2001; Menkhaus 2007). In addition to their emphasis on\nthe moral reintegration and rebuilding of society, Islamic and Christian\nmovements alike also involve a critique of corruption, and a focus on\neconomic advancement outside prevailing patronage systems (Fouchard\net al. 2005: 344; Maxwell 1998: 365).\nFar from being uniquely modern developments, the moralising and\nenterprise-promoting tendencies of African religious movements are part\nof a longer history in which religious conversion and renewal have\nfacilitated processes of popular resistance, economic development and\nclass formation. Religious conversion has long been associated with cre-\nating suitable conditions for accumulation and the formation of more\ncommercially oriented groups. In pre-colonial West Africa, historians\nhave traced the contribution of oracular religions and secret societies to\nthe development of inter-regional markets and long-distance trading net-\nworks in areas dominated by stateless societies, while conversion to Islam\nplayed a key part in creating a social and economic framework for cross-\ncultural trade and accumulation in areas with more centralised forms of\npolitical authority (Austen 1987; Lovejoy 1980; Northrup 1978). The col-\nonial period was associated with a range of new religious movements\nlinked to the rise of new ethics of production and accumulation, such as\nthe Mouride brotherhoods in Senegal in the late nineteenth century\n(Cruise O\u2019Brien 1975), the conversion of Zambian villagers to Jehovah\u2019s\nWitness (Long 1968), and Islamic conversion among Giriama palm pro-\nducers in coastal Kenya (Parkin 1972). In each case, religious conversion\nprovided the \u2018religious justification, spiritual protection and practical as-\nsistance\u2019 for converts to disentangle themselves from the demands of kin,\nR E L I G I OU S MOVEMENT S A ND E CONOM I C GOV ERN ANC E 403\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nand join new moral communities dedicated to accumulation through\ncommercial farming, shopkeeping and trade (Meagher 2005; Platteau\n2000). Neatly capturing the implications of these processes in colonial\nAfrica, and casting new light on contemporary religious dynamics, the\neminent economist Jean-Philippe Platteau (2000: 226) observed that :\nIn these new spiritual communities, emphasis is placed on virtues of self-restraint\nand consumption moderation (such as abstaining from drinking alcohol and\ngambling) and on the need to concomitantly do away with traditional feasts\nwhere lavish expenditures on food, drinks, and other goods are typically in-\ncurred \u2026 In most cases, it is conversion to Islam or Christianity that provides the\nnecessary escape from community loyalty with all its attendant social obligations.\nFar from representing a resurgence of superstition and witchcraft, in-\ndigenous as well as imported religious movements in many parts of pre-\ncolonial, colonial and contemporary Africa demonstrate processes of\nsocial and economic realignment that are more Weberian than occult.\nThis is not to suggest that religious movements are the solution to the\n\u2018crisis of governance\u2019 in contemporary Africa \u2013 far from it. Even sym-\npathetic studies have revealed growing problems of authoritarianism and\npatrimonial tendencies in both pentecostal and Islamic movements\n(Gifford 2004; Loimeier 2005; Marshall 1995; Maxwell 1998). In a de-\ntailed analysis of pentecostal churches in Ghana, Paul Gifford (2004: 188)\nargues that the prevailing moral message is neo-patrimonial and inimical\nto effective political engagement : \u2018Some churches are moving to structure\nthemselves along the lines of the unchallengeable Big Man rather than\naccountable leadership and popular participation. \u2019 Similarly, the leader-\nship of new Islamic movements in Senegal and northern Nigeria has\nshown a disturbing tendency to become tools of elite politics, and to favour\npersonal enrichment over social transformation (Adeboye 2005; Dahou &\nFouchard forthcoming; Obadare 2006). Moreover, religiously motivated\nviolence, challenges to state secularism and increases in witchcraft and\noccultist practices remain real, though by no means dominant, tendencies\nof contemporary religious movements.\nIn order to understand the implications of these conflicting processes of\npopular empowerment, patrimonial authoritarianism and occultism, we\nneed to move beyond tendencies towards what Ruth Marshall calls \u2018pol-\nitical reductionism\u2019 and \u2018symbolic expansionism\u2019, in which the insti-\ntutional impact and agency of believers are either ignored or replaced by a\nhermeneutics of the occult. Marshall emphasises the importance of a more\ninstitutionally fine-grained focus, not only on leaders and their interaction\nwith the state, but on the \u2018 implicit politics \u2019 of believers and the impact of\nconversion on social practice and political values : \u2018We need to ask what\n404 KATE MEAGHER\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nsort of representations of power, what sort of articulation of \u2018\u2018civic virtue\u2019\u2019\nare being constructed by the people, and to try to see what they might tell\nus about the possibility of instituting the form of society which we might\nrepresent as democratic \u2019 (Marshall 1995: 243). While Ellis and ter Haar\n(2007: 395) voice a similar concern to take the religious ideas of Africans\nseriously, representing the views of believers demands a focus on particu-\nlar groups in particular places \u2013 wealthy business people, civil servants, or\ninformal artisans in national or regional contexts \u2013 rather than on generic\nAfricans. Trying to decipher how new religious engagement influences the\nvalues of actual believers offers an opportunity to look beyond the more\ndramatic representations of African religious responses to neo-liberalism,\ncharacterised as \u2018post-political \u2019, and devoid of \u2018an ideological agenda, a\nsocial vision, a political program\u2019 (Comaroff & Comaroff 1999: 292). Not\nthat the focus on the \u2018 implicit politics \u2019 of believers is meant to suggest an\nabsence of spiritual motivation in religious practice ; it aims only to\nexamine how the spiritual impulses generated by the punishing economic\ncircumstances of globalisation and liberalisation have reshaped underlying\nvalues and forms of agency, for good or for ill.\nThere are two issues to be investigated here. The first relates to de-\nciphering the way in which participation in new religious movements\nshapes economic and political ethics among informal economic actors,\nand the second involves considering whether these movements have the\npower to effect lasting institutional change, rather than succumbing to\nmarginalisation, violence or hijack by more powerful social forces, in-\ncluding opportunistic religious leaders, political elites and global political\nforces. In other words, understanding the political implications of religious\nmovements in a context of rapid informalisation requires a focus first on\nhow religious change influences processes of class formation and social\nethics at the popular level, and second, on the capacity of these changes to\ntransform wider power relations within society.\nR E L I G I O N A N D E N T R E P R E N E U R S H I P I N N I G E R I A N\nI N F O R M A L E N T E R P R I S E\nAt the level of the informal economy, the influence of religious movements\nin Nigeria reveals a long history of economically productive tendencies\noperating under the surface of the state. Prospects for the institutional-\nisation of these processes seem less encouraging, given the feeble influence\nof the struggling masses on wider structures of power and authority. As in-\ndicated, the role of religious movements will be investigated in the context\nof three enterprise clusters : a weaving cluster in the Yoruba Muslim town\nRE L I G I OU S MOVEMENT S A ND E CONOM I C GOV ERN ANC E 405\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nof Ilorin in south-western Nigeria, and two clusters producing shoes and\ngarments, respectively, in the Igbo Christian town of Aba in south-eastern\nNigeria.1 These informal enterprise clusters were originally selected for\ntheir economic dynamism and apparently ethnic basis of organisation.\nThe role of religion in their development and contemporary expansion\nwas largely unanticipated.\nDespite being made up of very small informal firms \u2013 averaging fewer\nthan ten workers in the Yoruba weaving cluster and fewer than five in the\ntwo Igbo clusters \u2013 these activities have expanded dramatically since the\nonset of Nigeria\u2019s structural adjustment programme in 1986 (Meagher\n2007b). In towns with a population of about 1 million inhabitants, the\nIlorin weaving cluster employed over 10,000 weavers in the 1990s, and the\nAba shoe and garment clusters employed 46,000 and 12,000 people, re-\nspectively, by the year 2000, with a combined annual turnover on the\norder of US$200 million in the Aba clusters alone. Yet the vast majority of\nthe firms remain informal ; they are unregistered, evade key taxes, and\ncontravene basic labour, factory and zoning regulations. The rapid ex-\npansion of these informal enterprise clusters in the context of formal\neconomic collapse and pervasive hardship suggests a potential for econ-\nomic dynamism independent of the state that has raised new questions\nabout the wider political and economic implications of informal economic\ngovernance in Africa.\nReligion in the Ilorin weaving cluster\nIn the early development of these informal enterprise clusters, the effective\ncoordination of expanding economic activities outside the framework of\nthe state has repeatedly drawn on religious frameworks to embed com-\nmercial norms and relations of trust among producers and traders across a\ngrowing range of ethnic communities. In fact, in both the Yoruba and the\nIgbo cases, religion was central to the very formation of a cohesive ethnic\nidentity among participating producers. The Yoruba weaving cluster,\nwhich developed about a century before colonialism, included weavers of\na variety of ethnic origins, including Yoruba, Fulani, Nupe, Hausa and\nIgbirra, who became welded together under a Yoruba Muslim identity\nbased on use of the Yoruba language, the practice of Islam, and sub-\nmission to the authority of the Emir of Ilorin (Meagher 2007b). Similarly,\nthe two Igbo enterprise clusters, which emerged in Aba in the late colonial\nperiod, owed much of their success to efficient \u2018pan-Igbo\u2019 institutions of\napprenticeship, credit and trade that arose from common adherence to\npre-colonial oracular religions, particularly the Aro oracle, which imposed\n406 KATE MEAGHER\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nwidespread regulatory authority across an otherwise stateless array of\npolitically autonomous communities (Meagher 2006; Northrup 1978). As\nAxel Harneit-Sievers (2006: 58) observed in his masterful history of Igbo\nsociety, oracular religions \u2018played a role in the establishment and upkeep\nof networks that brought together the local elites of other politically\nautonomous communities over considerable areas \u2019.\nReligion has continued to shape processes of social and economic\nchange within these informal enterprise clusters, particularly after the\ncoming of colonialism. In particular, religious movements played a central\nrole in challenging, or restructuring, the economic dominance of founding\ncommunities within the clusters. In the case of the Ilorin weaving cluster,\nthe activity was founded by migrants from the weaving towns of the\ncollapsing Oyo Empire in the early nineteenth century. These weaving\ngroups shifted to Ilorin, which was the rising Yoruba power of the time.\nWhile weavers from other Yoruba as well as non-Yoruba ethnic com-\nmunities were integrated into the Ilorin weaving cluster over time, those\nfrom old Oyo weaving town lineages maintained a position of dominance\nin the activity. Their advantage was initially a product of accumulated\nskills, contacts and capital, but was increasingly due to their dominant\nposition in the weavers guild, which was lineage-based, and accorded\nleadership to those from old Oyo weaving lineages. However, colonialism\nprecipitated dramatic changes in the weaving business, demanding new\nkinds of political and economic connections, new forms of access to\nlabour, new language and educational skills, and adaptation to new ma-\nterials and changing market conditions. Resistance to Western education\namong the Muslim establishment of the area, reinforced by the policies of\nindirect rule (Ilorin was politically part of northern Nigeria where mission-\nbased education was discouraged), constrained the capacity of weavers to\nadapt to some of the new market opportunities created by colonialism.\nDuring the late colonial period, new Islamic movements created a\nmeans of addressing some of these pressures. Key among them were the\nexpansion of the Quadiriyya and Tijjaniyya Sufi brotherhoods into mass\norganisations during the 1950s, and the rise of modernising Islamic or-\nganisations such as Ansar Ud Deen, which came to Ilorin in the late\ncolonial period (Loimeier 2005). While Quadiriyya was the brotherhood of\nthe political establishment, and was preferred by the more established\nweavers, especially those in the guild leadership, Tijjaniyya brotherhoods\nappealed to those seeking advancement through commercial rather than\npolitical channels. In addition to promoting an ethic of piety, parsimony\nand discipline, Tijjaniyya encouraged a more accommodating attitude to\nWestern education. The popularised form of Tijjaniyya \u2013 known in\nR E L I G I OU S MOVEMENT S A ND E CONOM I C GOV ERN ANC E 407\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nNigeria as Tijjaniyya-Ibrahimiyya \u2013 spread rapidly in Muslim commercial\ncentres such as Kano, and was popular among weavers of a modernising\norientation who were impatient with the constraints of the weavers\u2019\nguild. As Loimeier (2005: 354) observed, Tijjaniyya \u2018became a network for\ntraders and entrepreneurs that saw their affiliation with the Tijaniyya-\nIbrahimiya as a channel to further their economic activities as a member\nof a transnational religious network that could provide important political\nand economic contacts, as well as spiritual protection\u2019. Others with\nmodernising tendencies also gravitated toward Ansar Ud Deen, though\nthis society had a more middle-class orientation, and only attracted a\nminority of weavers. At the time of my research in 2004\u20135, nearly one\nthird of weavers belonged to Tijjaniyya or Ansar Ud Deen, with the vast\nmajority in Tijjaniyya. Tijjaniyya members were significantly over-\nrepresented in primary and secondary education relative to members of\nmore mainstream Islamic groups, particularly among those born after the\n1950s. Interestingly, Tijjaniyya members were also less likely to know their\nancestral origins than other weavers.\nReligion in the Aba shoe and garment clusters\nThe Aba enterprise clusters revealed interesting variations in the re-\nlationship between founding artisanal groups and new religious move-\nments. The Aba garment cluster was founded in the late colonial period by\nmigrants from the relatively prosperous farming and trading communities\nof the former colonial district of Bende, in eastern Igboland. Bende in-\ndigenes had no pre-colonial specialisation in weaving or tailoring, but\nduring the colonial period became involved in cotton production and in\nitinerant tailoring, bringing them into contact with the colonial garment\nindustry. The comparative prosperity of Bende indigenes facilitated their\nentry into small-scale garment production, a mechanised activity with\ncomparatively high capital costs. These factors also supported a strong\norientation towards educational achievement within the garment cluster,\ndespite its informal sector status. In 2000, two thirds of garment producers\nhad secondary education, compared with just over one third in the Ilorin\nweaving cluster (Meagher 2007b).\nIn contrast to the Ilorin weaving cluster, the prominence of the found-\ning artisanal community within the garment cluster was supported rather\nthan undermined by the first wave of evangelical Christianity in the 1970s,\nand by the subsequent wave of pentecostal Christianity in the 1990s. This\ncoincided with a period of expansion in the garment cluster, accompanied\nby the entry of a wider range of other Igbo communities. Garment\n408 KATE MEAGHER\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nproducers of Bende origins gravitated towards the new churches, which\nencouraged an emphasis on skills, education and frugality, which were\nconducive to maintaining Bende advantage in the activity. Religious\nconversion also created a mechanism of solidarity for assimilating skill-\noriented producers from other Igbo communities into networks of soli-\ndarity and accumulation within the activity. At the time of my research,\n70% of garment producers from Bende communities, and just under 50%\nof producers in the garment cluster as a whole, belonged to evangelical\nand pentecostal churches. The leader of the Bende-dominated informal\ngarment producers\u2019 association was an evangelical pastor, and many\nothers were pastors or evangelical church elders. Membership in evan-\ngelical and pentecostal churches provided a skill-oriented framework for\noccupational solidarity, communal integration and accumulation. When\ninterviewing a non-Bende producer of men\u2019s suits who had been in the\ninformal garment cluster since the 1970s, I asked him if his lack of Bende\norigins was an impediment to advancement within the business. He\nanswered: \u2018No, so many of them are in my church. \u2019 He himself was a\nJehovah Witness who had served three apprenticeships in garment pro-\nduction in order to refine his skills sufficiently.\nAba\u2019s informal shoe manufacturing cluster has a very different social\nand religious history. It developed as the specialisation of migrants from\nthe former colonial district of Mbaise, a poor, particularly land-scarce area\nlocated in central Igboland. Mbaise migrants turned to informal shoe\nproduction owing to its extremely low capital and skill threshold. This\ninitially involved the use of simple hand tools for the production of crude\nsandals. Mbaise shoe producers had no artisanal history of shoe pro-\nduction or leather working, and concentrated initially on producing san-\ndals from old tyres. Over time, however, skills, equipment and materials\nbecame more sophisticated, leading to the production of contemporary\n\u2018 fashion shoes\u2019. As informal shoe production expanded during the 1970s,\nMbaise dominance of the business was rapidly eroded by entrants from\nother Igbo and even neighbouring non-Igbo communities, owing to the\nlow capital and skill levels of the majority of Mbaise producers. Despite\nbeing the founding artisanal group, Mbaise producers rapidly dwindled to\na small proportion of informal producers owing to their lack of competi-\ntive advantage, though some established Mbaise producers managed to\nmaintain a presence in the leadership of the shoe producers\u2019 associations.\nRegarded as a \u2018poor man\u2019s business \u2019, informal shoe production tended to\nattract entrants who lacked the resources or training to enter something\nbetter. Despite the entry of producers from more economically ad-\nvantaged communities, shoe production was associated with significantly\nR E L I G I OU S MOVEMENT S A ND E CONOM I C GOV ERN ANC E 409\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nlower levels of education than are observed in the garment cluster, and\neven in the Ilorin weaving cluster. Barely 13% of informal shoe producers\nhad secondary school education.\nOwing to the poor social backgrounds of informal shoe producers,\nand their low levels of education and skills, conversion to evangelical\nChristianity was much less common, particularly in the first wave of\nevangelical movements in the 1970s. Most shoe producers lacked the\neconomic security to risk alienating the political and religious establish-\nment of their home villages, and also lacked the requisite levels of literacy\nand skill to advance themselves through evangelical Christian channels.\nAmong the original Mbaise producers, and shoe producers as a whole, the\nvast majority remained members of the older established churches\n(Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist), even after the second wave\nof Christian revivalism in the 1990s. Even economically successful shoe\nproducers tended to cultivate status within the religious and political es-\ntablishment of their home villages, rather than to gravitate towards new\nreligious movements. In contrast to the garment cluster, the most suc-\ncessful group of shoe producers was dominated by those from trading\nrather than artisanal backgrounds. Economic success was based on a\ntrading ethic of profit and turnover rather than on a small industrialist\nethic of skills, education and reliability characteristic of high performing\ngarment producers. As a result, patrimonial rather than skill-based forms\nof accumulation and class formation predominated in the shoe cluster.\nMembership in new churches arose largely in the 1990s, involving pro-\nducers from more artisanally skilled and educated backgrounds who were\nforced into the activity by economic hardship, or who joined prosperity\nchurches in the hope of linking into new networks of assistance.\nBy the end of the twentieth century, new religious movements had\nconsiderably altered the social organisation of all three informal enterprise\nclusters. As Table 1 shows, founding communal identities had dwindled in\nimportance, and new religious movements provided important mechan-\nisms for occupational solidarity and economic advancement, particularly\nin the weaving and garment clusters. Moreover, in both Muslim and\nChristian areas, religious movements tended to act as modernising forces,\nencouraging educational attainment, as well as facilitating relations of\ntrust and solidarity, not only with other sub-ethnic communities, but with\nmembers of other ethnic groups. The one thing religious change does not\nappear to have affected is the gender division of labour, which continued\nto exclude women from operating firms in both the weaving and the shoe\nclusters, and which had always allowed significant female participation in\nthe garment cluster.\n410 KATE MEAGHER\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nS T R U C T U R A L A D J U S T M E N T , I N F O R M A L I T Y A N D N E W\nR E L I G I O U S M O V E M E N T S\nWhile the role of new religious movements, both Muslim and Christian,\nhas followed a fairly clear modernising logic within these informal\nenterprise clusters, their impact on informal enterprise performance and\nclass formation has been significantly altered by the pressures of economic\nrestructuring and democratisation. Tendencies towards the development\nof cohesive forces for popular entrepreneurship have become increasingly\nfractious and fragmented in the face of efforts from above to hijack re-\nligious movements for new purposes. In the process, productive processes\nof class formation from below have been disrupted from above, with in-\ncreasingly problematic economic and political consequences.\nThe onset of Nigeria\u2019s structural adjustment programme in 1986 sub-\njected informal producers to intense economic pressure. Between 1985 and\n1999, the Nigerian currency lost 99% of its value, and urban dwellers\nfaced an average annual inflation rate of more than 200% (Meagher\nforthcoming). Massive public and private sector retrenchment generated\nserious unemployment, leading to a flood of entrants into all manner of\ninformal activities. In Ilorin, more than half of existing weaving enterprises\nhave started up since the onset of structural adjustment, while in the two\nAba clusters, the overwhelming majority of producers have entered under\nstructural adjustment \u2013 with the result that more than half of them were\nunder thirty years of age in 1999.

This has been accompanied by an ex-\nplosion of religious revivalism, injecting a diversity of Christian and\nIslamic movements into the mix. Amid this economic and religious fer-\nment, the three clusters have responded in distinctive ways.\nPatrimonialism, modernisation and Islamic radicalism: what weavers want\nThe latest wave of Islamic reformism that has gripped Nigeria since\nthe 1980s has had comparatively little effect on the Ilorin weaving cluster,\nfor a variety of reasons. The new revivalist phase involves a range of anti-\nSufi, fundamentalist movements, including Izala, the so-called Shi\u2019ite\nmovements, and the forms of \u2018political Islam\u2019 behind the imposition of\nshari\u2019a law in many of the northern Nigerian states (Kane 2003; Loimeier\n2005). While these movements have had a powerful impact in northern\nNigeria, they have comparatively little political or religious appeal\nto Muslims in the Yoruba south-west. Yoruba communities, and even\nfamilies, are often religiously mixed, and more belligerent forms of Islam\nare perceived as unnecessarily divisive. The new Islamic movements\nthat have generated a following in the south-west, such as NASFAT2 or\nQuareeb,3 are largely Yoruba middle-class movements which emphasise\nmelding modernisation with Islamic lifestyles, rather than the creation of\nan Islamic state. Their orientation towards high levels of education, the\nuse of English, modern media technology and an economic concern with\nemployment in the modern sector creates a milieu that would tend to\nembarrass rather than to captivate artisans. Only two weavers out of a\nsample of over fifty were members of any of these new organisations. One,\nwho had secondary school education and used weaving to supplement his\ncivil service salary, was a member of Quareeb, while the other, a trader\nwho seemed to spend little time on weaving, belonged to a more marginal\nIslamic society.\nGiven its comparative lack of appeal, the new wave of Islamic\nreformism has had little effect on Muslim\u2013Christian relations in the weav-\ning cluster. Owing to the tendency to take on apprentices and labour from\nsurrounding Christian Yoruba and minority weaving communities, 40%\nof weavers employed some Christian workers, and a tiny percentage even\nemployed women workers. Moreover, in the context of weakening mar-\nkets, one area of expanding demand was the production of banners and\nceremonial wear for church celebrations. Sixty-seven percent of weavers\nengaged in weaving contracts for churches. From the point of view of\nweavers, the pentecostal revival was more a bonus than a threat.\n412 KATE MEAGHER\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nThe real struggles unleashed within the weaving cluster took place\nalong the lines of the earlier processes of class formation set in motion in\nthe 1950s by the rise of Tijjaniyya brotherhoods. While markets for Ilorin\nweaving initially expanded under structural adjustment, when imported\ncloth became too expensive, demand has fallen dramatically since the late\n1990s owing to economic hardship, the liberalisation of textile imports,\nand intense competition triggered by unemployment and rapid entry into\nthe weaving business (Meagher 2007b). These pressures have exposed\nemerging faultlines between the more conservative weavers who dominate\nthe weavers\u2019 guild and represent the weaving profession to the state, and\nmore progressive weavers who tend to be younger, and to favour inno-\nvation, education and the development of new markets rather than ad-\nvancement through patronage ties.\nThis struggle has expressed itself in two ways. The first and most dra-\nmatic has been a split in the weavers\u2019 guild between the old guard and a\ngroup of younger modernisers. In the old guard, power is concentrated\namong senior, less educated weavers of Oyo weaving town origins, with\npredominantly mainstream religious affiliations. The young modernisers\ninvolve slightly younger weavers (in the gerontocratic context of Yoruba\nsociety, \u2018young\u2019 means under fifty), with limited education, more diverse\norigins, and a more economically responsive and innovative approach to\nweaving which has allowed them to outperform their seniors. The split in\nthe weavers\u2019 guild took place in the early 1990s, in the context of a dispute\nover the relocation of the main weaving market. Two important points for\nthe purposes of this discussion are that both groups appear to be domi-\nnated by weavers who have been three or more generations in the busi-\nness, and that membership in Tijjaniyya is not important in either group.\nThe central point of contention appears to be a struggle for control over\nthe traditional weaving markets in the context of intense competition and\ncollapsing demand. Weavers have conventionally sold their wares in two\nor three specialised periodic markets for indigenous cloth, located in the\ntowns of Ede, Ibadan and now Oyo, some distance from Ilorin. In the\npast, Ilorin cloth was also traded to Ghana, Sierra Leone and other parts\nof West Africa, but war and economic hardship have all but wiped out this\nlonger-distance trade, narrowing the main marketing networks to those\ncentred on the periodic weavers\u2019 markets.\nThe old guard have tended to address their economic difficulties by\nasserting their authority over the terms on which weavers can enter the\nmarket, and by lobbying local politicians for contracts and assistance.\nThey themselves recognise that they are only showing an interest in pol-\nitical links because demand for weaving is low, but the more they rely on\nR E L I G I OU S MOVEMENT S A ND E CONOM I C GOV ERN ANC E 413\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\npoliticians to solve their problems, the less they can afford to criticise them.\nThey also reproach the young modernisers for exacerbating their mis-\nfortunes by disturbing conventional marketing channels and refusing to\nattend the annual prayers organised by the weavers\u2019 guild, which has\nbroken the solidarity of weavers. While the old guard rely on traditional\npatronage politics to address their problems, the young modernisers have\ngrown disillusioned with local patronage arrangements, which only seem\nto take an interest in weavers at election time. The younger weavers\ncomplain that local politicians refuse to see them when their represen-\ntatives want to discuss the problems in the weaving business, but will come\nat election time to \u2018dash\u2019 them N10,000 for \u2018 soft drinks \u2019 and ask for their\nvote. Efforts to link up with Ilorin indigenes in high federal government\nposts, or to attract the ear of the state through gifts or participation in\ntrade fairs, have all failed to turn markets around or to attract state at-\ntention to their occupational concerns. A spokesman for the association of\nthe young modernisers declared that, after repeated efforts and discussions\nabout what could be done about the decline of the weaving business, they\nresolved that the only thing they could do was pray.\nA second, less visible, process is unfolding at the level of those who\navoid political channels and concentrate on gaining access to new markets.\nWhile the traditional marketing outlets are suffering from overcompetition\nand declining demand, new marketing channels have opened up over the\npast decade or so that demand new production and marketing skills. One\nof these new channels involves the global trade in Ilorin cloth to members\nof the West African and black diaspora in the USA and the UK. This\nchannel demands higher-quality production, rapid changes in fashion,\nand doing business with middle-class operators who take cloth overseas,\nrather than operating through the local cloth marketing system. Because\nmany of these overseas traders are Yoruba, many weavers have managed\nto link up with this trade on at least an occasional basis. Indeed 64% of\nweavers had at least some customers who engaged in this overseas trade.\nHowever, it is worth noting that nearly 80% of Tijjaniyya members en-\ngaged in this trade, compared to less than 60% of other weavers, and that\namong those who did engage in this circuit, Tijjaniyya members had\nconsiderably higher annual incomes than other weavers.\nA second new channel involved trading to boutiques in Lagos and Port\nHarcourt that catered to high society Nigerian customers. These estab-\nlishments are often run by wealthy business people and \u2018people in high\nplaces \u2019 \u2013 it was even said that the wives of some Yoruba governors sell\nIlorin cloth through high-value channels. Even more than the overseas\nmarkets, these high society markets demand high-quality materials, fine\n414 KATE MEAGHER\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\ncraftsmanship, and reliable delivery. As one weaver explained, the main\nworry of those competing in this market channel is not how to reduce the\nprice so that people will buy, as is the case in the regular cloth markets, but\nhow to increase quality and variety to satisfy a higher class of customer.\nOne informant maintained that the difference between those who sell to\nboutiques in Lagos and Port Harcourt and those who sell in the traditional\ncloth markets is education. Those who sell to boutiques have to deal with\ncustomers who may not speak Yoruba, or may not wish to. But this same\ninformant sold primarily to boutiques himself, and only had a primary\nschool education, although he spoke excellent English, which was unusual\namong weavers. He was distinctive in that he was young, came from a\nweaving family with a strong emphasis on craftsmanship, placed a high\nvalue on education and on thorough training in weaving and marketing\nskills, and belonged to the Tijjaniyya brotherhood. This is only anec-\ndotal \u2013 only a couple of traders in the sample traded to Lagos \u2013 but it does\nsuggest that Tijjaniyya continues to foster the kinds of \u2018protestant \u2019 virtues\nthat facilitate economic efficiency and the formation of reliable commer-\ncial networks in ways that tend to circumvent, rather than depend on,\npatrimonial ties.\nUnfortunately, the global \u2018War on Terror \u2019 has begun to undermine\nthe global markets for Ilorin cloth. Weavers and cloth traders noted that\ndemand from overseas markets has been negatively affected since\n11 September 2001. Nigerian as well as \u2018white \u2019 people who used to come to\nbuy Ilorin cloth for export now come much less, and some have stopped\naltogether. A trader in the Ibadan cloth market was told by her overseas\ncustomers that they faced greater problems getting visas to come to\nNigeria.\nPentecostalism and vigilantism: gaining the ear of the state\nIn contrast to the experience of Ilorin weavers, informal enterprise in Aba\nhas been dramatically affected by the second wave of religious revivalism\nin the 1980s and 1990s. The rapid proliferation of pentecostal churches has\nbeen so marked in Abia State, in which Aba is located, that the state\nlicence plates bear the slogan \u2018God\u2019s Own State \u2019. This pentecostal en-\nthusiasm is also reflected at the level of informal enterprise. In a sample of\n132 producers across the two clusters, 27 different denominations were\nrepresented, involving 21 evangelical sects, 5 mainstream churches, and\n1 Muslim convert (he said Christianity had become too much of a racket,\nand he felt it was better to save his money and become a Muslim). As this\nanecdote suggests, the spread of pentecostal conversion did not negatively\nR E L I G I OU S MOVEMENT S A ND E CONOM I C GOV ERN ANC E 415\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\naffect relations between Christians and Muslims at the popular level.\nHausa Muslim embroiderers, who were particularly skilled, were routinely\nhired by informal garment firms. Many shoe producers specialised in a\ntype of shoe bought only by Muslim traders from the north, and one shoe\nproducer claimed that he would rather give credit to Hausa (Muslim)\ncustomers than to Igbos, because the Hausa were more reliable in re-\npaying.\nAs previously indicated, the impact of Christian revivalism was par-\nticularly pronounced among garment producers. Despite the rise of\n\u2018prosperity \u2019 churches in the 1990s, pentecostalism in the garment cluster\ncontinued to reflect an adherence to the earlier messages of holiness and\nsalvation associated with the preceding wave of evangelical Christianity.\nAs Maxwell (1998) and Marshall (1993) remind us, the earlier form of\nChristian revivalism was originally a movement of artisans and other\ntoiling classes. As in the Muslim weaving cluster, the earlier phase of re-\nligious revival remained relevant among garment producers even after the\nrise of new movements oriented to the less ascetic concerns of middle-class\nand elite constituencies. The \u2018other-worldly \u2019 message of strict pentecostal\nchurches, calling for asceticism, strict personal ethics and prayer, not only\nstrengthened the economic ethic that drove accumulation within the gar-\nment cluster ; it also helped producers to cope with the economic dep-\nredations of structural adjustment.\nAs of the year 2000, roughly half of garment producers were members\nof pentecostal churches, rising to nearly two thirds in the most successful\nquartile. The majority of evangelical garment producers adhered to as-\ncetic movements that required a complete break with tradition, which\neffectively disembedded them from conventional relations of solidarity.\nThis facilitated a conservation of resources by encouraging modesty in\ndress as well as abstention from drinking and costly forms of socialising\ncommon in Igbo society. More strikingly, adherents were also forbidden\nto participate in their hometown association, which is viewed as a cultural\nobligation among the Igbo. The objective was to dissociate themselves\nfrom \u2018sinners \u2019 who engaged in drinking and idol worship associated with\nhometown socialising and ceremonial practices. In the process, producers\nliberated themselves from the increasingly costly levies and contributions\nrequired by their hometown associations in a time of declining state\nfunding and increased local political mobilisation. They also cut them-\nselves off from the fallback of communal assistance, something only the\nmore skilled and industrious producers could risk. Concerns about de-\nmons, exorcism and spiritual reprisals should be understood in the context\nof the severe communal pressures brought to bear on those who attempted\n416 KATE MEAGHER\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nsuch a radical break. For those with the requisite levels of skill, discipline\nand commitment, pentecostalism provided practical and spiritual sol-\nutions to individual and social problems, contributing to \u2018 the creation of\nnew identities and the articulation of strategies for survival and mobility \u2019\n(Marshall 1993: 216).\nBy fostering an ethic of accumulation through skills and hard work,\npentecostalism represented an anti-patrimonial strategy of economic ad-\nvancement. Disillusioned with the unreliability and corruption of patri-\nmonial networks, converts focused on \u2018blasting away not only old values,\nbut old networks \u2019 (Mayer 1961). At the time of my research, the garment\ncluster had close communal ties with the Abia State governor, who hap-\npened to come from one of the most influential Bende communities in the\ncluster. Some of the older garment producers even knew the governor as a\nboy, and had close ties with some of his senior relatives. Yet adherence to\nthe pentecostalist injunction to withdraw from participation in their\nhometown associations was strongest among the most established Bende\ngarment producers, severing their strongest claim to patrimonial assist-\nance. The president of Aba Garment explained that informal linkages\nthrough influential townsmen had not proven particularly helpful for\nsolving their real problems, and access to such people was unreliable.4 Far\nfrom cosying up to government officials, the informal garment producers\u2019\nassociation tended to adopt an arms-length relationship with local and\nstate governments, and had even taken the federal government to court\nover a case of official harassment.\nInstead, garment producers concentrated on building new networks\nthrough business contacts, religious connections, and the pursuit of direct\naccess to formal institutional channels. Church-based links offered access\nto more productive and trustworthy labour, to business contacts who ob-\nserved strict moral codes, and to flows of resources and information\nthrough regional and global pentecostal networks. The garment pro-\nducers\u2019 association also attempted to forge direct institutional links with rel-\nevant organs of the state, rather than cultivating patrimonial channels of\naccess. Through the garment association, garment producers were mem-\nbers of the Nigerian Association of Small-Scale Industrialists (NASSI), and\nin 2000 were making efforts to register their association with the Federal\nGovernment so that they could lobby directly for controls on Asian textile\nimports. However, these strategies had limited success in linking informal\ngarment producers into new networks of power, even after the expansion\nof the pentecostal movement to attract middle-class and elite participants.\nEven in the church, strategic resources and contacts tended to be mono-\npolised by more powerful classes, while efforts to link up directly with the\nR E L I G I OU S MOVEMENT S A ND E CONOM I C GOV ERN ANC E 417\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nformal sector and the state failed as the result of the informal status and\npolitical marginality of producers in the garment cluster. Despite their\ncommitment to \u2018 the spirit of capitalism\u2019, informal garment producers are\nlanguishing in the face of state neglect, Asian import competition and\ninfrastructural collapse.\nIn the shoe cluster, the new wave of pentecostalism has had a rather\ndifferent impact. Despite a continued bias in favour of the established\nchurches, there has been a more significant wave of conversion to pente-\ncostalism since the 1990s. As indicated above, 37% of shoe producers had\nconverted to pentecostal churches by 2000. This considerable level of\npentecostal participation was a product of fairly recent conversions, and\nthe entry into the shoe cluster of producers from a more diverse range of\ncommunities and backgrounds. However, pentecostal converts in the shoe\ncluster tended to adopt the more \u2018entrepreneurial \u2019 forms of networking\ncharacteristic of the \u2018prosperity \u2019 churches, rather than the ascetic forms of\nwithdrawal from society characteristic of the earlier wave of Christian\nrevivalism (Ojo 2005: 400). Only 10% of producers in the shoe cluster\nbelonged to church groups that required withdrawal from their hometown\nassociation. These ascetic Christians were concentrated among more\neducated entrants and those from artisanal communities, most of whom\nhad been forced into the shoe cluster by adversity, and were not particu-\nlarly successful producers owing to their lack of capital. The majority of\npentecostal shoe producers converted in order to expand their social net-\nworks rather than to transform them. Efforts in the 1990s to make\nNigerian pentecostal churches more \u2018elite friendly\u2019 (Adeboye 2005: 448),\nand to forge links with Christian elites within the state, made these\nchurchesmore attractive to shoe producers, who saw conversion as a way to\nform supportive ties with wealthier and better-placed members of society.\nThis tendency to see conversion as a means of cultivating additional net-\nworks of assistance led to the phenomenon known in Aba as \u2018change your\nchurch\u2019, which was twice as common in the shoe cluster as it was in the\ngarment cluster. Changing one\u2019s church refers both to conversion, and to\nthe tendency to shift from one pentecostal church to another looking for\nthe most conducive environment.\nBoth in their preference for the established churches, and in their\npractice of pentecostal conversion, shoe producers revealed an orientation\ntowards patrimonial strategies of economic advancement. Given their\nmore marginalised social and economic backgrounds, low levels of edu-\ncation and poor skills, the majority of shoe producers lacked the social\nand human capital to adopt a strategy of dissolving old networks and\nbuilding new ones. The strategies of shoe producers and of their enterprise\n418 KATE MEAGHER\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nassociations focused on embedding themselves more deeply in patrimonial\nnetworks in Aba and in their home communities. Among the most suc-\ncessful shoe producers, none had converted to pentecostal churches, all\nwere members of their hometown associations, and there was a strong\npreference for membership in a range of social clubs which helped to link\nthem to the patronage of people of wealth and power through social events\nand ceremonies to which dignitaries and patrons were invited \u2013 precisely\nthe sorts of dissipation of resources that the successful garment producers\navoided. The shoe cluster associations (there were six of them) all culti-\nvated links with the local and state governments, and engaged in favours\nand kickbacks that assisted accumulation among executives, but did little\nto advance the cluster as a whole (Meagher 2006).\nUltimately, it was the shoe producers rather than the garment pro-\nducers who managed to capture the attention of the state. Despite the\npowerful social impact of new religious movements in the garment cluster,\nand the efforts of the garment association to forge direct economic and\npolitical links with relevant government institutions, garment producers\nhave remained marginalised and ignored by the state. In the shoe cluster,\nreligious entrepreneurship and the cultivation of patrimonial ties have\nbrought them occasional crumbs from the state, though these tend to be\nmonopolised at the top. It was only when the shoe producers formed a\nnotorious vigilante group known as the Bakassi Boys in the late 1990s that\nthey actually attracted any real state attention (HRW\/CLEEN 2002;\nUkiwo 2002). Suddenly, the shoe producers controlled something with the\npower to wield public authority beyond the sphere of the poor and the\npowerless. While the objective of the vigilante group was initially to make\nAba safe for visiting traders from other parts of Nigeria and beyond who\ncame to buy shoes and other goods in Aba, it was rapidly hijacked by the\nAbia State governor for attacks on local Muslims in early 2000 as a reprisal\nfor the killing of Igbos in anti-shari\u2019a riots in northern Nigeria (Meagher\n2007a). These attacks not only ran against the grain of local relations\nbetween Christians and Muslims in Aba, but undermined accumulation in\nboth the shoe and the garment clusters by scaring away valuable Muslim\ncustomers and workers for almost a year afterwards. Once the activities of\nthe vigilante group moved away from prevailing notions of justice and\naccountability, references to occult powers and protective charms were\nincreasingly used to justify violations of conventional norms of law and\norder. Occult idioms were thus used to override popular ethics, rather\nthan representing them, but local people were also adept at turning occult\nidioms back on the vigilantes and their advocates by demanding empirical\ndemonstrations of their supernatural powers when abuses of authority\nR E L I G I OU S MOVEMENT S A ND E CONOM I C GOV ERN ANC E 419\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nbecame excessive (ibid.). Clearly, productive, patrimonial and occult ethics\nall played a role in the spiritual impulses of these informal producers, but\nin complex and textured ways not reducible to cultural propensities or\nliteral interpretations.\n: : :\nWithin the context of Nigerian informal enterprise, there is clear evidence\nthat both Islamic and Christian religious movements have given rise to\ndistinctly Weberian \u2018modernising tendencies \u2019, rather than being reducible\nto \u2018occult economies \u2019 or born-again patrimonialism (Kane 2003: 245; Ojo\n2005: 397). But if they are to promote development and democracy,\nmodernising tendencies among the poor and the powerless must be sup-\nported by more powerful social groups or by the state. The opposite ap-\npears to be happening in Nigeria. Middle-class forces have increasingly\ncaptured new religious movements in both Christianity and Islam for their\nown economic and social objectives, limiting the potential of these move-\nments for the economic and political empowerment of the informalised\nmasses. Entrepreneurial religious leaders and political elites have also be-\ngun to instrumentalise these movements in the service of pantomimes of\ndemocratisation, cultivating links between new religious leaders and poli-\nticians to mobilise electoral support or to shift the balance in elite power\nstruggles. Even global forces have actively engaged in capturing or\nthwarting religious networks for their own political ends. In this tangle of\npolitical machinations, the fragile process of entrepreneurial class for-\nmation within the informal economy has been all but lost.\nEvidence from the Nigerian informal economy suggests that serious\nconsideration of how religious revivalism is shaping economic ethics and\npolitical possibilities in Africa demands an awareness not only of new\nforms of agency from below, but of existing modes of domination. The\nmodernising entrepreneurial ethic of Tijjaniyya and ascetic evangelical\nprotestantism has been increasingly marginalised by state neglect, and by\nthe economic and political instrumentalisation of new Christian and\nIslamic movements, encouraging a rising tendency towards patrimonial\nforms of religious engagement, even among informal artisans. As Terence\nRanger (1985) reminded us over two decades ago, religious movements\nare not just political movements in disguise \u2013 something that some\nrecent commentators seem to have forgotten. Ranger cites John Waliggo\u2019s\n(cited ibid. : 52) comment that African popular movements have historically\nrepresented a longing for change in a situation in which \u2018 few can\nreally trigger change\u2019. While they may give rise to new forms of social\n420 KATE MEAGHER\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nidentification and political consciousness, religious movements have a class\nas well as a cultural dimension, and they are about powerlessness as much\nas new forms of power.\nIn contemporary times as well, much depends on the way in which the\nspecific \u2018 implicit politics \u2019 of popular religious activism links up with more\npowerful social forces. This is especially true of movements that emerged\nfrom the poor and aspiring middle classes in developing countries, whose\nlonging for change continues to outstrip their power to demand it. As\nRuth Marshall (1993: 242) observed in her analysis of Nigerian pente-\ncostalism, \u2018what sort of lasting social and political impact such a challenge\nmay have is as yet unclear, and depends \u2026 to a large extent on the way\nthe movement becomes politicised, if at all \u2019. While processes of poli-\nticisation are very much in evidence in Nigerian Christian and Islamic\nmovements, their current trajectory is not encouraging from the perspec-\ntive of popular economic and political transformation. The problem,\nhowever, does not lie in the cultural orientation of indigenous religious\nexpression, but in its instrumentalisation by more powerful social, political\nand global forces.\nN O T E S\n1.
