Introduction to the Themed Section\nI a n G r e e n e r\nSchool of Applied Social Sciences, University of Durham\nE-mail: ian.greener@durham.ac.uk\nReaders of this journal will have seen themed sections on partnerships, governance and\ncitizenship (volume 5, issue 2) and \u2018consumerism in social policy (volume 2, issue 1) and\nmight be asking exactly why a further one that combines these elements is now necessary.\nHaving considered similar topics separately in these pages, why is it now necessary to\nlook at them together?\nA good starting point is that recent work from both academics (Le Grand, 2007) and\nthe UK government (Minister of State for Department of Health, Minister of State for Local\nand Regional Government, andMinister of State for School Standards, 2005) is making the\ncase for increased user choice in welfare services by suggesting that \u2018voice\u2019 mechanisms\nare not working. \u2018Choice\u2019 and \u2018voice\u2019 are therefore being counterposed as alternative\napproaches to achieving one of the present government\u2019s central goals of welfare reform,\nthat of increasing service responsiveness. \u2018Choice\u2019 and \u2018voice\u2019 provide not only a neat\nrhyming framing device for considering how users might becomemore involved in service\ndelivery, but clearly link to the twomain ways that Hirschman suggested, in his remarkable\nbook of 1970, that individuals could cause firms, organizations or states to decline.\nHirschman suggested that individuals, wishing to improve the service they receive, have\ntwomain strategies: exit or voice. \u2018Exit\u2019 exists where theymove to another provider instead,\nand \u2018voice\u2019 where they choose instead to complain or to demand improved service. Of\ncourse, the twomay also be combined, with complaint, or the threat of it, appearing before\nexit. Hirschman suggested that firms should be trying to achieve \u2018loyalty\u2019, and emphasised\nthe problem that, where individuals leave service providers without the managers of those\nproviders knowingwhy (as can often happenwith exit), those providers will bewithout key\ninformation as to what is going wrong for them. Equally, however, a situation without exit\ncreates the possibility for managers to become lazy and complacent where no adequate\nvoice mechanisms exist either. This possibility seems particularly relevant to a great deal\nof public service provision \u2013 exit only exists for those people able to afford a private sector\nalternative, and voice mechanisms may be inadequate or not present at all. It may even be\nthat the most likely groups to complain in a given situation have already deserted public\nprovision for private, creating a situation where, Hirschman suggests, stagnation is likely\nto occur. The key message of Hirschman\u2019s work is that exit and voice are not necessarily\nopposites, but are instead strategies often used together to achieve improvement, or, in\nthe worst cases, are both unavailable, leaving it to the professionals and the managers\nrunning public services to self-generate improvements.\nEqually, there is a general tendency for recent reforms to move increasingly towards\nchoice mechanisms, as they are meant to both improve access to services (users choose\nproviders rather than professionals) as well as drive up standards (with providers having\na strong incentive to improve as resources follow choices). Choice is therefore seen as\nmaking services fairer and more responsive. Voice is not being ignored, however, with the\nUK government making increased use of technology to create \u2018listening\u2019 events, as well\nas holding summits to which members of the public are invited so they can contribute\n197\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 Aug 2010 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nChoice or voice?\nto the future of welfare policy. Alongside this, people are encouraged to become active\nin health policy, in local hospital affairs; to play an active role in the running of their\nlocal school; and attend local council meetings so they are aware of how budgets for the\ncommunities in which they live are being allocated. The government appears to expect us\nto demonstrate choice as a transferable skill in our lives as consumers of a range of private\ngoods, so acting as highly selective, rational and careful choosers of public services as\nwell. However, it also expects us to make time to be involved in the running of public\nservices as well, going to local meetings to make our voices heard. We are meant to be\nboth choosers and concerned citizens.\nHow realistic is this? In an era where we are routinely told that engagement with\npolitics and political processes generally reaches ever-lower levels (Stoker, 2006), is it\nreally the case that people wish to be involved in both the choosing and running of public\nservices? Could a greater involvement in public services actually be the means by which\npolitical apathy could be broken down? The evidence seems very mixed. In terms of\nchoice, there is a great deal of difference between prospective choice, that is being asked\nwhether you would like a choice over a particular service, and current choice, actually\nmaking a choice once given. If asked in the street whether we would like greater say\nin how our lives are run, few of us will say no. However, actually then making those\nchoices once granted is an entirely different thing. Work from Schwarz (2004) shows that\nprospectively the vast majority of us would like a choice of different providers if diagnosed\nwith a serious illness. However, once actually getting a serious illness, this falls to a small\nminority. This is an extreme case in many ways, but is illustrative of the problem that\npublic service professionals, for all of the complaints and bad press often made against\nthem, are still remarkably highly trusted to make decisions on our behalf.\nAgain though, the word \u2018choice\u2019 itself seems to suggest something that someone either\nhas or they does not have This may be inappropriate when considering public services. In\nsituations of consultation with a doctor, most of us would like to be consulted and have\ntreatment options laid out before us. This doesn\u2019t mean we have to make choices entirely\nby ourselves, or that the doctor has to make the choice without consulting the patient.\nThere are middle ways based on co-production or discussion models. These combine\nchoice with voice, especially where the service user is making repeated visits to the\nprofessional.\nNeither choice nor voice are intrinsically a good thing. Choice can be intimidating\nif the user feels unable or unqualified to deal with what is before them. Voice can be\ntime-consuming and result in frustration where the user doesn\u2019t feel their opinions are\nbeing adequately taken into account. In some public services, choice mechanisms might\nwork well, but in others a longer-term discussion without the threat or necessity of user\nexit might be more appropriate. Just because choice works in some areas, it does not\nmean it becomes a universal panacea for reform. It is still not clear, for example, exactly\nwhat benefits having a choice of train providers gives to a potential trail traveller when all\nthey want is to get to a particular place at a particular time. Equally, however, the criticism\nthat public services have often been extremely poor at dealing with voice mechanisms,\nparticular in terms of holding professionals accountable (Marquand, 2004), is well made.\nThe following chapters explore the complexities of both choice and voice from a\nrange of different perspectives. Catherine and Hugh Bochel and their colleagues examine\nthe notion of user participation critically, demonstrating its complexity and outlining some\nof the key challenges faced by services attempting to achieve greater involvement. In the\n198\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 Aug 2010 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nChoice or voice?\nend, their message is a positive one, in that although there are no new magic solutions,\nthe problems experienced in attempts to get users more involved can be at least reduced,\nbut only if the policy process is to become more radical.\nRichter and Cornfield\u2019s contribution maps the shift from service users being treated\nas \u2018citizens\u2019 towards instead public services treating them far more as \u2018customers\u2019. They\nsuggest this has happened because customer-relationshipmanagement can be regarded as\na transferrable \u2018shrink-wrapped\u2019 technology that encourages users to constitute themselves\nas customers. If service users are treated as customers, then that is how they will behave.\nThis clearly carries with it difficulties for public services more accustomed to organising\naround their professionals than their users. However, theremay be good economic reasons\nfor public service professional orientation \u2013 if they are the limiting factor in service\ndelivery, it remains an open question as to how exactly services are to be organised\naround the needs of users whilst professionals remain the scarce resource.\nNeedham\u2019s contribution explores the potential for a middle way between treating\nservice users as consumers or citizens, exploring an empirical case of co-production,\nwhere deliberate workshops might be used to attempt to come to shared solutions. It\nchallenges the idea that public services must treat their users as either passive figures or\nhyper-active consumers. Needham\u2019s case shows both the strengths and the limitations\nof the co-production approach, and is a valuable case study in how greater public\nengagement can be created if sufficient resource and time is devoted to that goal.\nAllsop and Jones examine the role of complaints in healthcare settings. Complaints\nrepresent a key area of the debate between choice and voice as they form, along with\nco-production, a possible middle way between the individualism of choice and the\ncollectivism of voice. Complaints can be made by individuals that improve services\nfor all service users, provided that public organisations are adequately held to account\nand review their services appropriately. The story offered by Allsop and Jones, sadly,\nis not encouraging. Complaints procedures remain \u2018lengthy and onerous\u2019 and a more\nconsumerist approach to dealing with complaints has come at the cost of \u2018openness,\nindependence and fairplay\u2019.\nFinally, Clarke, Newman and Westmarland present a piece that exposes the conflicts\ncompressed in arguments about choice, showing how they move power away from\n\u2018bureau-professional organisations\u2019 and encourage service users, through a process of\nindividualisation, to take a greater involvement in service decision-making. Choice-\noriented policies therefore move the boundaries between the personal and private realms,\nremaking relationships between individuals and state. The authors suggest that choice\nagendas cannot be responded to by attempting to urge a return to \u2018old\u2019 public services,\nbut that instead we must reconsider the very nature of the \u2018publicness\u2019 of pubic services.\nThese pieces together provide a fascinating introduction to cutting-edge debates\nwithin the field, as well as offering some guidance, following the Labour mantra of the\n1990s, as to what might \u2018work\u2019. A common theme is a hostility to the unthinking extension\nof choice into public services that policymakers would do well to take greater account\nof.\nRefe rences\nHirschman, A.
