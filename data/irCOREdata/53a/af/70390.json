In recent years, the proliferation in use of the GSM short message \nservice (or SMS) has prompted numerous studies into person to person \nmessaging via mobile devices.  However, to date, there has been relatively little \nexploration of systems that enable mobile messaging to (potentially ubiquitous) \nsituated displays rather than the mobile devices of particular individuals. In this \npaper, we describe the results of an ongoing trial to explore the utility of a \nsystem that enables lecturers in a computing department to use their mobile \nphones to send messages to digital displays situated outside their offices. \n1 Introduction \nPerhaps one of the most surprising phenomena to have occurred within the field of \nmobile computing within recent years has been the uptake of SMS (or Short Message \nService) text messaging. For example, according to the Mobile Data Association \n(MDA), the total number of chargeable person-to-person SMS text messages sent \nacross the four U.K. GSM network operators during the day between midnight on \n31st December 2002 and midnight on 1st January 2003, was 102 million, a 59% \nincrease compared to figures over the same period in 2002 [3].  \nOne use of SMS that has received little investigation to date is to enable a \n(potentially mobile) user to message a display in a particular place rather than a \nmobile device owned by a particular individual.  O\u201fHara et al [4] discuss situated \ndisplays as being \u201csituated at particular locations within our environment\u201d and yet \nwhich, paradoxically, \u201callow information to be more easily updated dynamically and \nremotely\u201d.  Although the origins of our work pre-date this quote, it is exactly this \npotential for updating situated displays remotely that forms the focus of this paper. \nThe Hermes system [2] was designed to explore the issues that arise when office \nowners are provided with a digital \u201eoffice door display\u201f. One issue we wished to \nexplore was whether the traditional way of posting messages on post-it notes in \u201esemi-\nprivate\u201f places could be enhanced with such a digital equivalent.  One of the major \ngains of an electronic system is that it supports remote interaction.  This includes a \nweb-based interface, email and, most significantly for this paper, SMS. \n2      Keith Cheverst, Alan Dix, Dan Fitton, Adrian Friday and Marc Rouncefield \nThere are numerous examples of office door display systems and a full overview of \nthese and related systems can be found in [2].  However, none of these currently \nprovide (much less evaluate) an explicit facility for mobile messaging. One \ninteresting example of a system that utilises SMS messaging in conjunction with \nsituated display involves a U.K. police force. This police force has developed a \nsystem that enables appropriate personnel to use SMS in order to post road warnings \nto displays situated on the roadside [1]. In common with Hermes, the system is \ndesigned to supplement existing approaches. In this case, the existing approach for \nalerting anonymous drivers of hazardous road conditions is local radio.  \n \n2 A Brief Overview of the HERMES System \nWork on developing the Hermes system started in October 2001 and the first unit was \ninstalled outside one of the offices in the computing department in March 2002.  \nCurrently ten Hermes displays are deployed around the department outside the offices \nof lecturers, research assistants, PhD students and department secretaries. Figure 1 \nillustrates a Hermes display and one of the department\u201fs corridors containing a \nconcentration of Hermes displays. \n \nFigure 1: Picture of an early Hermes display (left) and deployed displays (right). \nThe functionality supported by the system can be considered from two main \nperspectives, namely: the perspective of the owner of the Hermes display and the \nperspective of a visitor to the Hermes display. \nOwners can create messages to appear on their own Hermes displays. Messages \n(which can take the form of text or graphics) can be created on the display itself, via \nthe Hermes web page, an e-mail client or by sending an SMS text message. This \nmessage is then visible on the door display. \nOne important aspect of a Calm technology is that it \u201c\u2026engages both the center \nand the periphery of our attention, and in fact moves back and forth between the two\u201d \n[5]. The Hermes display has just these properties: for a passer-by it does not grab \nattention, but for someone visiting the office it is immediately obvious. The situated \nnature gives us this flexibility of attention \u201efor free\u201f. \nVisitors can also leave messages on an owner\u201fs display.  However, once entered, \nmessages left by visitors are not visible to passers-by. There are two main reasons for \ncontrolling this aspect of visibility. Firstly, because of the limited display space, \nExploring the Utility of Remote Messaging and Situated Office Door Displays      3 \nHermes must give priority to the owner\u201fs message. Secondly, we wanted to encourage \nowners to feel in control of the personal space represented by their individual Hermes \ndisplays.  The owner can read left messages via a web portal, email or using his or her \nHermes display directly. Owners can also request notification via SMS when a new \nmessage is left on their Hermes display. \nA sketch illustrating the basic system architecture of Hermes is shown in Figure 2.  \nA detailed explanation of the architecture is beyond the scope of this paper, but more \ndetails of the approach can be found in [2]. Briefly, at the heart of the system is a \nsingle central server application that stores messages and user profile information, \nhosts the Hermes web portal and supports communication with the SMS Gateway. \n \n \nFigure 2: The System Architecture of Hermes [x]. \n3 Motivation for Enabling \u201cTexting\u201d to Hermes Displays \nFrom an early design stage we realized the potential importance of providing the \nowners of Hermes displays with the ability to send a message to the display situated \noutside their office using their mobile phone. Our reason for providing this facility \nwas based on personal experiences in the past where we have felt the need to post \nmessages on our door from some remote location and so have had to phone through to \na secretary or colleague and ask him or her to stick an appropriate post-it note \nmessage on our door. The typical message that a lecturer might ask to be posted \nwould be something like \u201cSorry, car problems, away this A.M.\u201d, or \u201cSorry, running \n30 mins late\u201d.  Clearly such an approach disturbs the person being asked to write the \npost-it note and requires the person to be contactable (often not the case with very \nbusy secretaries) and free to perform the task. \nSometimes, the message posted may also be posted to the computing department\u201fs \nmailing list, e.g. if the person has been taken ill and is likely to be off the entire day. \nHowever, for messages of slightly less importance (or less wide appeal) it is very \nunlikely that such an e-mail would be sent. During a typical office day, lecturers have \na series of fixed appointments with students and also maintain a \u201edrop-in\u201f period for \nstudents to discuss problems. A message such as \u201cRunning 30 mins late\u201d is therefore \n4      Keith Cheverst, Alan Dix, Dan Fitton, Adrian Friday and Marc Rouncefield \nextremely useful for supporting dynamic rescheduling and for reaching students that \nmay not read their e-mail in time if  an accompanying e-mail was actually sent. \n4 Experience and Analysis \nAs Hermes has been deployed on a substantial scale and for a prolonged period we \nhave been able to obtain significant feedback, both to enable evolutionary \nimprovements and to give us a rich understanding of real use. \nThe remote messaging facility in Hermes (though not the overall Hermes system) \nwas primarily envisioned as a feature to support lecturers in the department. \nCurrently, six of the ten Hermes display owners are lecturers.  Here are views of three \nof these lecturers (A, B and C) towards the remote messaging facility who have been \nlong term Hermes users. \nLecturer A attempted to use the remote messaging feature on a small number of \noccasions when the remote messaging feature was first introduced and unfortunately \nthe reliability of the system was poor. He had found that the messages which he had \nsent using SMS had was not appeared on his Hermes display. This early experience \ndamaged his trust of this aspect of the system and so he has subsequently not used this \nfeature (although he very frequently posts messages on his Hermes display using the \nother approaches available). This lecturer is keen for the system to reassure him that a \nmessage has actually been displayed by providing him with improved feedback. \nLecturer B has used the feature on several occasions. In common with lecturer A \nthis lecturer started using the feature when it was first introduced and encountered \nsome reliability problems. However, he has used the remote messaging feature \nsuccessfully on several occasions and is prepared to trust the feature. In common with \nlecturer A, this lecturer is also keen for a greater level of feedback to be provided to \nincrease his confidence that a sent message has successfully been displayed. \nLecturer C was issued with a Hermes display several months later than lecturers A \nand B at a time when the reliability of the remote messaging feature was very high. \nIndeed, this lecturer has used the remote messaging feature fairly frequently for \napproximately six months and has not experienced any reliability problems with the \nSMS feature. Indeed, he has expressed a strong level of trust in the reliability of the \nremote messaging facility.  Examples of his messages include \u201cam running 20 \nmins late\u201d, \u201cOn bus 2.15 - in soon\u201d, \u201cOn bus - in shortly\u201d, \u201cGone \nto the gym\u201d, \u201cDerek - in ww burger joint\u201d and \u201cIn big q at post \noffice.. Will be a bit late. C\u201d \nAs can be seen, Lecturer C\u201fs messages include both temporal and location \nelements. Also, most messages are not targeted to a specific individual, with the \nexception of the message directed to Derek. We specifically asked the lecturer about \nhis reasons for posting this targeted message and he revealed some interesting points.  \nIt transpired that when the message was sent, lecturer C had an appointment with \nDerek in lecturer C\u201fs office but was delayed at a working lunch. He did not have \nDerek\u201fs mobile phone number, but, interestingly, he said he doubted whether he \nwould have tried to contact Derek by mobile phone anyway (he suspected that Derek \ndid not regularly carry a mobile phone).  Also, by the time he realized he would be \nExploring the Utility of Remote Messaging and Situated Office Door Displays      5 \nlate, he doubted that Derek would have received an e-mail in time. Lecturer C also \ncommented on the situated and \u201cmultipurpose\u201d nature of his message, it provided not \nonly the right notification to Derek but also informed those passing his office that he \nwas currently delayed and likely to be running late. On this occasion situation, the \nSMS to his office door display was his primary means for communication. \n6 Discussion and Future Work \nIn this paper, we have described the results of our initial exploration into a novel \nmessaging paradigm, which focuses on enabling users to remotely update their \n(situated) office door displays.  This has shown that: \n\uf0b7 Trust and reliability are key issues for this use of messaging. Appropriate \nfeedback is essential in order to establish confidence that the message has \nreally been displayed and thus encourage continued use.  \n\uf0b7 This approach supplements existing email, voice and paper systems, but in \nsome circumstances can become the primary means of communication. \n\uf0b7 Traditionally, a lecturer might phone a secretary or colleague in order to ask \nhim or her to place a post-it note message. As envisaged, Hermes has \nreduced this and so reduced disturbance, but in addition has encouraged \nmessages such \u201cIn big q at post office.. Will be a bit late\u201d \nwould probably not have warranted a special phone call to the secretary. \nOur current development effort is focused on extending the current level of \nfeedback provided by the Hermes system, answering one of the key problems \nhighlighted above.  The sender of a message will be provided with an \nacknowledgement when his or her SMS message is actually received by the door \ndisplay as opposed to simply received by the SMS gateway (see figure 2).   \nOne area of future work will be to explore the potential use of the Multimedia \nMessaging Service (MMS). This will allow the owner of a Hermes display to receive \nmessages left on his or her door via an MMS capable mobile phone and also to enable \nthe owner to send multimedia messages to display on the door display. \nWe also intend to trial the use of situated displays and remote messaging in the \nfamily home. One can envisage a situated display placed in the kitchen with other, \nmore private, displays situated in other locations around the house, such as outside \nbedrooms. Family members would then be able to send messages to situated displays \nin addition to, the mobile phones of individual family members. \nIn summary, we believe that our initial studies suggest the significant potential of \nmessaging to situated displays, as providing a simple, lightweight and flexible \nmechanism for displaying informal notifications to an appropriate location. \n7 References \n1.
