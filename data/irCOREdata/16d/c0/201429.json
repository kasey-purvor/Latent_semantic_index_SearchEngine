The paper aims at identifying and assessing economic evaluations in both these areas to support evidence based prioritisation of resource allocation.\\ud\nMethods\\ud\n\\ud\nA systematic review of health and non health related bibliographic databases, complemented by a hand search of key journals and analysis of grey literature has been carried out. Study characteristics and results were qualitatively summarised. Economic evaluations of programmes that address mental health outcome parameters directly, those that address relevant risk factors of mental illness, as well as suicide prevention interventions were included, while evaluations of drug therapies were excluded.\\ud\nResults\\ud\n\\ud\n14 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. They varied in terms of topic addressed, intervention used and study quality. Robust evidence on cost-effectiveness is still limited to a very small number of interventions with restricted scope for generalisability and transferability.

This is supported by data showing that promo-\ntion and prevention strategies reduce the individual and\nsocial impacts of poor mental health [4]. Thus, these inter-\nventions may not only be effective but potentially cost-\neffective in an economic sense.\nOne in four individuals can expect to experience mental\nhealth problems during their lifetimes [5]. Conservatively\nthe costs of poor mental health have been estimated to\naccount for between 3% and 4% of GDP in developed\ncountries [6]. A number of long term longitudinal studies\nindicate that untreated mental health and behavioural\nproblems in childhood, in particular, can have profound\nlongstanding social and economic consequences in adult-\nhood, including increased contact with the criminal jus-\ntice system, reduced levels of employment and often\nlower salaries when employed, and personal relationship\ndifficulties [7-10]. Yet there is a growing body of literature\nthat provides some (typically short term) evidence on the\neffectiveness of a range of prevention programmes which\naddress known or at least assumed risk factors for mental\ndisorders [11-20]. There is also some evidence on the\neffectiveness of programmes focussing on the early detec-\ntion and early intervention for severe mental disorders,\nparticularly depression and schizophrenia [21-24].\nIn the context of increasing budget constraints and rising\ndemands for evidence-based health spending, evidence\non effectiveness alone is insufficient for policy making; in\naddition to knowing what works and in what context,\ninformation on the economic costs and consequences of\nany intervention is required. Given the inevitable con-\nstraints on funds available for all public sector interven-\ntions, economic evaluations are increasingly used as one\nkey input to decisions on how to allocate resources to var-\nious health system actions, most notably for assessing\npharmaceuticals, medical devices and procedures [25].\nMore recently, arguments have also been put forward to\nexamine the economic case of all areas of public health\nand health promotion [26] and while some studies have\nbeen conducted in these areas, such evaluations remain\nfew compared with health care interventions [27].\nIt is therefore no surprise that the use of economic evalu-\nations in the field of mental health care generally contin-\nues to grow [28], but little has previously been reported\non the extent to which the cost-effectiveness of mental\nhealth promotion (MHP) and mental disorder prevention\n(MDP) programmes has been considered and, if so, what\nform these evaluations take. This paper aims to systemat-\nically collate relevant evidence to help address the ques-\ntion as to whether it is worth investing in MHP and MDP\ninterventions from an economic perspective. It seeks to\nidentify those areas in which economic evaluations have\nmost commonly been used, and reports on the economic\ntechniques used. It also looks at the extent to which avail-\nable economic studies focus solely on the prevention of\nmental health disorders or also have sought to assess the\ncost effectiveness of the promotion of improved mental\nwell-being.\nMethods\nA systematic review protocol was developed in line with\nrecommended guidelines [29-31] in order to identify eco-\nnomic evaluations in the areas of MDP and MHP. A range\nof bibliographic databases, MEDLINE\/PUBMED, Embase,\nCinahl, Psychinfo, Psyndex, Econlit, ERIC and NHS EED\nwere included in the protocol. This was complemented by\na hand search of key journals, as well as an internet search\nfor grey literature, including governmental reports and\nacademic working papers. Precise search terms were\ndependent on the database used, but all included core\nmedical subject headings and title\/abstract phrases\nincluding 'mental disorder', 'mental illness', '(primary)\nprevention', 'health promotion', 'preventive measures',\n'occupational health', 'workplace health promotion' and\n'suicide prevention'. In addition to the use of the Medical\nSubject Heading 'costs and cost analysis', other economic\nterms used were 'economics', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost util-\nity', 'cost benefit', 'cost consequences' and 'economic eval-\nuation'.\nConsidering the fragmented pattern of scientific evidence\nin the MHP and MDP fields a pragmatic approach to\ndefining inclusion and exclusion criteria was required.\nFirstly, those economic evaluations of mental health pro-\nmotion or prevention interventions were included that\naddressed either mental well-being or mental disorder as\nan outcome parameter directly (e.g. changes in a measure\nof happiness or a depression scale). Secondly, studies\nwhich focused on preventing outcomes specifically recog-\nnised as well-known risk factors for future mental disorder\nwere included (e.g. behavioural problems in children).\nAdditionally, we included papers on suicide prevention,\nalthough suicide is not always related to mental health\nproblems.\nWhile the definition of mental disorders was based on the\nICD classification, studies which evaluated programmes\non alcohol and drug dependency were excluded. In\nrespect of prevention we restricted the review to studies on\nprimary and secondary prevention alone as defined by the\nWHO [32]. Thus, we included evaluations of early detec-\ntion to lower the rate of established cases of mental disor-\nders, while tertiary prevention which would include muchPage 2 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2008, 8:20 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/8\/20use of drug therapy was excluded. Furthermore, with\nrespect to economic evaluation, we took into account\nmethodological discussions which suggest that for public\nhealth interventions the definition of economic evalua-\ntion must be broadened so as to include methods such as\neconometric studies of regulatory, fiscal or legislative\nchange. In addition, we wanted to ensure that studies\nwhich combined qualitative evidence on impact, such as\nindividual satisfaction rates, alongside economic data\nwould be included in our review [33]. Thus, the review\nprotocol design went beyond conventional economic\nevaluations to identify other relevant economic analyses,\nincluding cost consequence analysis where costs and\neffectiveness measures are not synthesised into a single\nratio. However, studies that only addressed costs such as\ncost-of-illness studies were excluded.\nThere were no date restrictions imposed on the biblio-\ngraphic database search, but our analysis was limited to\nstudies in English and German. Study selection was ini-\ntially on the basis of study abstract, with data extraction\nand assessment conducted independently by two review-\ners based on available checklists [25,34]. According to\nsuggested methodological standards [35] quantitative\nresults in monetary terms were converted into the single\ncurrencies of US$ and Euros by using GDP Purchasing-\nPower-Parities. Additionally, they were adjusted for price\nlevels referring to the year 2006.\nResults\nThis search process resulted in 398 hits. 361 papers were\nexcluded on the basis of abstract alone. From the 37\nremaining studies, 5 could not be obtained, leaving 32\nstudies, 18 of which did not meet all inclusion criteria,\nleaving 14 studies in our analysis (see Figure 1; for a full\nreference list of excluded studies see appendix).\nCompared to the economic evaluation of medical inter-\nventions for mental illness (e.g. pharmaceuticals), the\nnumber of available studies that evaluate MHP or MDP\ninterventions from an economic perspective is low. The\nbroad and fragmented nature of promotion and preven-\ntion interventions meant that our hand and internet\nsearch were however able to identify 8 of the 14 studies,\nas they did not appear in the largely medical databases.\nTable 1 provides a summary of the study characteristics\nand main results.\nHalf of these studies evaluated programmes in three Euro-\npean countries (the UK, Netherlands and Sweden) with\nthe remainder being in the US. Some of these US based\nevaluations, in fact covered a number of programmes\n[36,37]. One made use of effectiveness results from a vast\nnumber of different US early childhood development\n(ECD) interventions and adolescent support programmes\n[37]. In terms of (effectiveness) evaluation activity, com-\nmon with many health promoting or public health inter-\nventions, this seemed to be higher in the USA than in\nEurope (at least in the field of ECD). The majority of eco-\nnomic evaluations applied conventional economic tech-\nniques such as cost benefit, cost effectiveness, cost utility\nor cost consequence analysis. Some studies included sim-\nulation models in order to look at projected long term\ncosts and benefits.\nWhile six studies were conducted prospectively alongside\nthe collection of primary data [38-43], eight economic\nevaluations were either based on the retrospective second-\nary analysis of data resulting from experimental or quasi-\nexperimental studies [44-46], or developed simulation\nmodels using effectiveness data obtained through system-\natic and non-systematic reviews [36,37,47-49]. Although\nin the majority of studies the study design for measuring\neffectiveness was based on randomly selected interven-\ntion and control groups, due to the nature of these inter-\nventions double-blinding was not possible. As in any\nother case of preventive intervention evaluations, this\nraises the potential of bias in outcome measurement.\nMoreover, in some cases the study design was a controlled\nobservational trial where the intervention group was com-\npared to a non-randomised control group. This again is\nsub-optimal with respect to evaluating the causal relation-\nships between an intervention and outcomes (see table 1).\nWhile the evaluations identified were diverse in terms of\ntype of intervention, a high proportion of the studies dealt\nwith measures to prevent depression, sometimes with a\nsecondary objective of preventing suicide. The remainder\nfocused on addressing some of the overall risk factors for\nmental disorders. No economic evaluations were found of\ninterventions that address mental well-being rather than\nmental illness as an outcome parameter.

(2006) [38] in the Netherlands evaluated the\ncost-effectiveness of minimal-contact psychotherapy as a\npreventive measure for individuals at high risk of depres-\nsion. At 12 months the incidence rate ratio of depression\nwas 0.65 when comparing the intervention (11.9) and\nusual care groups (18.3). At a cost-effectiveness threshold\nof US$ 23,000 (\u20ac 20,000) per case avoided, a 70% to 80\n% probability (depending on the costs included) that the\nintervention would be cost-effective compared to stand-\nard actions was shown. Additionally, there was a 40% to\n60% probability that the intervention would be dominant\ncompared to standard care (i.e. better outcome at a lower\ncost). However, these calculations are based on a rather\nshort time-horizon of one year and the trial design does\nnot guarantee an unbiased evaluation. As the authors\nremark, the results cannot be reliably transferred to other\ncountries because of the differing health care system con-\ntexts.\nIn England, Petrou et al. (2006) [39] evaluated a preven-\ntive intervention targeted at women who were at high risk\nof developing postnatal depression. Based on a pragmatic\nrandomised controlled trial they found a non-significant\nincrease in depression-free-months, as well as a non-sig-\nnificant increase in health and social care costs in the\nintervention group. At a willingness to pay threshold of\nUS$ 1,800 (\u20ac 1,500) per prevented month of depression,\nthe probability that the intervention is cost-effective was\nreported to be 70%. The non-significant nature of effec-\ntiveness data meant that this probability did not exceed\n80% even at substantially higher willingness to pay\nthresholds.\nLynch et al. (2005) [46] evaluated the cost effectiveness of\ncognitive-behaviour therapy for high-risk teenagers with\ndepressive parents over a one year period. In the year after\nthe intervention, intervention participants reported signif-\nicantly more depression free days than the control group\n(301 versus 248). The authors argued in favour of the\nintervention based on the fact that cost-effectiveness\nratios are within the same range as those for accepted\ndepression treatments in the US, with the reported cost\nper quality adjusted life year (QALY) remaining below the\nthreshold of US $ 50,000 (\u20ac 45,000) per QALY gained.\nHowever, the long-term effects of the intervention were\nnot analysed and the intervention group was rather small\nwhich does not allow the results to be generalised.\nValenstein et al. (2001) [47] evaluated alternative strate-\ngies of screening for depression among adults in the US.\nThey assumed that screening would increase the diagnosis\nof depression by 50 % for individuals with major depres-\nsion (from 45 % to 68 %). Treatment effects of diagnosed\ndepression were then based on a meta-analysis of rand-\nomized controlled trials. Compared with no screening,\nperiodic or annual screening of 40-years old adults\nresulted in rather unfavourable cost-utility ratios (US$\n68,000\/\u20ac 60,000 to US $ 260,600\/\u20ac 220,000 per QALY).\nThe most favourable ratios (US$ 34,000\/\u20ac 30,000 to US $\n60,000\/\u20ac 44,000 per QALY) were found with one-time\nscreening compared to no screening, yet the results were\nnot very robust in sensitivity analysis. According to the\nauthors, the cost-effectiveness of screening is likely to\nimprove if more effective treatment is available.\nFive studies looked at the economic case for suicide pre-\nvention: Sari et al. (2007) [49] analysed the net benefit of\ntwo programmes, general suicide awareness versus peer\nsupport programmes for the prevention of suicides in uni-\nversity students in Florida. They applied a simulation\nmodel using data on recorded suicides and a meta-analy-\nsis to estimate the effectiveness of the two prevention pro-\ngrammes. Based on the estimated effect rates for general\neducation and peer support programmes to prevent sui-\ncide (57 % and 60 % respectively), the authors came to\nthe conclusion that implementing both programmes in\nall universities in Florida would result in net benefits of\nUS$ 21 million (\u20ac 18 million) and US$ 32 million (\u20ac 27\nmillion) respectively, representing benefit-cost ratios of\nUS$ 2.36:1 and US$ 4.30:1 (\u20ac 2:1 and \u20ac 3.70:1).\nZaloshnja et al. (2003) [44] retrospectively examined the\ncost-effectiveness of a suicide prevention programme for\nadolescent Native Americans belonging to the Western\nAthabaskan tribe in rural New Mexico. A wide range of\ninterventions were included in the programme including\nthe use of lay people trained as 'natural helpers' to support\nyoung people in crisis and notify mental health profes-\nsionals of the need for assistance. The programme was\nevaluated by a mirror study comparing the suicide rate of\nthe targeted age group before and after the intervention.\nThe suicide rate of other age groups was used as a 'quasi'\ncontrol group. Economic evaluation was conducted by\nmeans of cost benefit and cost utility analysis. Results of\nthe former indicated a cost-benefit ratio of US$ 47 (\u20ac 40)\nper $ invested while the latter revealed a very favourable\nincremental cost effectiveness ratio of US$ 460 (\u20ac 514)\nper QALY gained. The study is however limited by the lack\nof an appropriate control group and the fact that it was\nimpossible to attribute any change in the suicide rate to a\nspecific element of the programme. The very specific set-\nting and population group for this study also implies that\nits results cannot be generalised easily to other contexts or\nsettings.\nAppleby et al. (2000) [42] analysed the costs and effects of\nan educational intervention aimed at front-line health\nprofessionals enabling them to assess and manage sui-\ncidal patients. Based on effectiveness data (which indi-Page 5 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2008, 8:20 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/8\/20cated high rates of programme uptake, improvement of\nassessment skills, as well as satisfaction with the training)\nthey estimated cost effectiveness ratios, using different\nassumptions about the potential reduction in suicide rates\nas result of this educational intervention. They estimated\nthat if 2.5 % of the suicides in a defined English district\ncould be prevented by the programme, then the cost per\nlife year gained (LYG) would be US$ 6,200 (\u20ac 5,300) or\nUS$ 183,000 (\u20ac 156,200) per suicide prevented. The\nmain limitations of the study however are that it is not\nbased on an experimental study design and moreover that\nthe reduction of suicide rates related to the use educa-\ntional programme must be based on assumptions.\nByford et al. (1999) [41] in England analysed the cost-\neffectiveness of a home-based social work intervention for\nchildren and adolescents that had deliberately poisoned\nthemselves. The programme aimed at reducing suicidal\nideation and costs from further service demand. The study\nfound no statistically significant differences between\nintervention and non-intervention group in terms of out-\ncome and total costs (although the intervention group\nhad higher intervention costs this was offset by lower\ncosts for subsequent health and social care service utilisa-\ntion). According to the authors, the intervention could be\nconsidered as cost-effective as routine care alone.\nRutz et al. (1992) [45] conducted a partial cost-benefit\nanalysis where they compared a Swedish educational pro-\ngramme for general practitioners which aimed at prevent-\ning suicide via improved treatment of depression with no\nsuch intervention. As a proxy to calculating monetary ben-\nefits they used suicides prevented. The related numbers of\nreduced days of sick leave (10,898 days) and lives saved\n(19), as well as reduced drug costs, resulted in an average\nnet benefit of US$ 37 million (\u20ac 31.6 million). However\nthe results were sensitive to the method of calculating\nmonetary benefits and assumptions concerning suicides\navoided. Furthermore, the analysis is limited as effective-\nness data on the educational programme for suicide\nreduction were not derived from a rigorous experimental\nstudy design but from quasi-randomisation with retro-\nspective comparison of two Swedish regions with and\nwithout the programme. The long term impacts of the\ntraining intervention on physician practice also remain\nunclear. Thus, whether any reduction in suicide can be\ncausally related to the educational programme remains\nambiguous.\nProgrammes that address overall risk factors\nA further group of studies evaluated interventions that\nwere targeted at young parents or mothers having to deal\nwith stressful socio-economic circumstances. Two pro-\ngrammes to support mothers in deprived London inner-\ncity areas have been compared to standard care in terms of\nmaternal and child health (including mental health) and\ncosts by Wiggins et al. (2004) [40]. Both interventions\nwere more costly than standard services and did not show\nany significant impact on primary outcomes. This is simi-\nlar to a study by McAuley et al. (2004) [43] which evalu-\nated the outcomes and costs of 'home-start support for\nyoung families under stress' in Northern Ireland and\nsouthern England. Again, no significant improvements in\noutcomes were found, but higher costs were incurred by\nthe intervention group.\nIn contrast to studies identified in the UK, several US stud-\nies reported quite favourable results for ECD programmes.\nMost of these studies do not report outcomes for mental\nwell-being per se, but they have been included in the anal-\nysis because they address well-accepted risk factors for\nmental disorders.\nIn the United States Schweinhart et al. (2005) [48] evalu-\nated the monetary net benefits for pre school-support for\nchildren with low IQs from families with low socio-eco-\nnomic status. To do so he used effectiveness data from a\nspecific pre-school programme ('Perry Pre School Pro-\ngramme'). Compared to the control-group, net benefits in\na long-term evaluation arising from better school per-\nformance, higher income, reduced crime, fewer drug\nproblems and reduced use of anti-depressants were\nshown. The results could, however be overestimated as\nthe intervention was described as a pilot programme\nwhere the teachers involved were particularly committed\nto the programme.\nLynch (2004) [36] also used the 'Perry Pre-School study',\ntogether with three other studies that had similar aims, to\ncalculate the long-term net benefit from the perspective of\nthe tax payer and the public purse. According to his\nresults, if provided to 20% of all US three and four year\nold children living in poverty, the programmes would\nresult in benefit-cost ratios between US$ 4.01:1 and US$\n9.27:1 (\u20ac 3.42:1 and \u20ac 7.91:1), depending on the differ-\nent programmes' effects. Furthermore, he argued that after\n17 years, the net effect on the government's budget from\nrolling out one of the programmes, 'Perry Preschool', on a\nnationwide basis would be positive. Despite this finding,\ngeneralising the results from a regionally developed and\nimplemented programme to a broader context where edu-\ncational systems may differ dramatically, raises issues of\nuncertainty, the more so, as this programme was devel-\noped in the 1960s and may be less appropriate to the\ntwenty first century.\nThe final study identified was a simulation study by Aos et\nal. (2004) [37]. They quantified the effects found in scien-\ntific literature on ECD and adolescent support pro-\ngrammes, made some adjustments for the quality ofPage 6 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2008, 8:20 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/8\/20effectiveness data and estimated the monetary benefits\nand costs for the selected studies. The results illustrate that\nfrom 61 selected interventions net benefits could be\nshown for almost two thirds. The results range from a net\nbenefit of US$ 33,100 (\u20ac 28,000) to net costs of US$\n52,000 (\u20ac 44,000). The highest net benefits were demon-\nstrated for juvenile offender programmes. Additionally,\nevidence for net benefit was presented for some home vis-\niting programmes that were targeted at high-risk and\/or\nlow-income mothers. Each programme area that was\nexamined had some interventions that were not cost effec-\ntive. In addition to the limitations described for the previ-\nous examples, a further restriction of this analysis was that\nstudies where outcomes could not be monetised were\nexcluded.\nDiscussion\nWith regard to quality criteria for health economic evalu-\nations [25,34] only a few of the reviewed studies provide\nstrong evidence that preventive interventions are cost-\neffective. The clearest evidence, albeit in a US context, sug-\ngests that early intervention programmes for children and\nadolescents are worth financing [36,37,48].\nBy contrast, despite the fact that the reduction of suicide is\noften one of the few defined targets for population mental\nhealth in many countries, there remain few studies to date\nthat look at the cost effectiveness of suicide prevention\nprogrammes. In many respects this is not surprising, as\ncomparatively few interventions have been the subject of\neffectiveness analysis [50]. This is one area where work is\nclearly needed.\nWhile the number of studies identified in this area\nremains very limited, some analysis now suggests that the\npotential cost effectiveness may compare very favourably\nwith those for other public health interventions if strate-\ngies can be demonstrated to be effective in averting sui-\ncides [51]. This may remain the case even if a conservative\napproach to costs is adopted, focusing solely on the\nimmediate direct costs of suicide and future lost produc-\ntivity costs averted, rather than also including the intangi-\nble costs to individuals of the immediate and unexpected\nloss of life that account for as much as 70% of the costs of\nsuicide in some studies [52].\nChallenges in generating and assessing effectiveness\nThe variability in the quality of all studies identified is\nmarked, although given the extra challenges, the majority\nof evaluators tried to develop appropriate, pragmatic and\ncreative study designs. As with other areas of public health\nevaluation, the principal challenges do not relate to eco-\nnomic evaluation per se, but rather to the generation and\nattribution of effectiveness data for complex interventions\nwith long-term outcomes.\nAlthough the knowledge about risk factors for mental dis-\norders has grown rapidly [5,11-15,53,54], there is no sin-\ngle risk factor which can explain more than 15% of the\nonset of a mental disorder [15]. Consequently, the detec-\ntion of statistically significant risk reduction in poor men-\ntal health by an intervention may require very large\nsample sizes; something that is not practical or financially\nfeasible in most studies. Effectiveness may, however be\nincreasingly detected in interventions that are directed at\nseveral risk factors in high risk populations [55]. A similar\nproblem arises with suicides. Completed suicides are in\nabsolute terms relatively rare events in most countries,\nmaking it difficult to demonstrate the impact of interven-\ntion on suicides at national level, let alone at a sub\nnational level.\nMoreover, as with many other public health interven-\ntions, the long time frame between intervention and effect\nis a major barrier to assessing the long term effectiveness\nof interventions, although judicious use of modelling may\nhelp at least to look at potential cost effectiveness of inter-\nventions if different levels of effect are achieved. Nonethe-\nless, greater investment in long-term follow up studies is\nrequired to overcome this problem.\nDespite this limitation, there is an evidence base indicat-\ning that many severe mental disorders which appear in\nlate adolescence or early adulthood may be associated\nwith risk factors that manifest themselves in early child-\nhood [e.g. [13,56,57]]. While long term 'Framingham\nstudies' in mental health remain rare, there are several\nstudies that have monitored the health and socio-eco-\nnomic circumstances of cohorts of children over several\ndecades in countries including England [7], New Zealand\n[10] and the United States [8]. These are now being used\nto illustrate that the absence of intervention in childhood\nfor mental health problems may have long standing and\nprofound socio-economic consequences in adulthood.\nWhile these studies remain relatively rare, and moreover\nwere not intended originally to identify mental health\nproblems in childhood, they can be helpful in a policy\ncontext. Opportunities for more prospective evaluation\nmay now arise [58].\nGeneralisability of findings\nAnother challenge, given the limited number of studies\navailable, is the extent to which the results from the eval-\nuations may be of use in other countries or even in differ-\nent regions within the same country. Due to the specific\nprogramme context of many interventions, the scope for\ngeneralisability and transferability may be restricted. The\neffectiveness of two identical mental health promotion or\nprevention programmes may vary considerably depend-\ning on the context and setting where the intervention is\nimplemented. This is related to the cultural, social andPage 7 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2008, 8:20 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/8\/20economic context of the study population which can have\na significant influence on the intervention process and its\neffect. As has been shown earlier, examples include those\nhome-visiting programmes targeted at low-income moth-\ners which have shown favourable results in the US but\nfailed to show benefits in the UK. This also indicates the\nimportance of gathering qualitative data on the process by\nwhich interventions are delivered which should help\nunderstand what factors lead individuals to make use of\nhealth promoting interventions. Ideally this could be\nundertaken concurrently with economic evaluation and\nmay also help policy makers elsewhere both identify and\nestimate the costs of adaptations required to implement\ninterventions in their own jurisdictions.\nLimitations of the review\nThe small number of studies identified as part of this\nreview may, to some degree, be an artefact of the difficulty\nin conducting a review of economic evaluations in the\nareas of health promotion and public health. This has\nbeen highlighted previously [59,60]. Designing a search\nstrategy that has a high degree of precision, that is it will\nfind a high proportion of relevant studies, is difficult to\nachieve without making use of a wide range of terms\nrelated to public health and health promotion. The\nnumber of irrelevant papers in the total recall rate, that is\nthe total number of studies identified, in our study was\nhigh, although in absolute terms the 398 studies initially\nidentified is a modest number compared to many reviews\nin more medical areas. This low number of studies might\nalso reflect the misclassification of economic terms in\ndatabases, which may mean that bone fide economic eval-\nuations are overlooked [61].\nOur exclusion criteria and review protocol also would\nhave excluded studies which address mental health as part\nof general health promoting strategies, but do not distin-\nguish between mental and physical health. Examples for\nthis are the numerous workplace health promotion pro-\ngrammes that do not address mental health directly but\nstill may have a positive impact on mental health. In addi-\ntion, our reliance on the use of abstracts to determine\nwhether or not to include or exclude studies might also\nmean that relevant studies might have been inadvertently\nexcluded. Despite these limitations, our lack of economic\nworkplace mental health promotion studies for instance,\nis consistent with other reviews in this area, which have\nreported few specific mental health orientated pro-\ngrammes, although stress reduction programmes are\nincreasingly forming an element of workplace health pro-\nmotion programmes [62].\nConclusion\nMHP and MDP interventions have a high potential to be\nof economic benefit to society. The evidence base at\npresent is scant, making it difficult to formulate general\nrecommendations on how to prioritise between individ-\nual interventions. Moreover, information to aid in the\ntransferability of available results to different contexts and\nsettings is limited. More country and population specific\neconomic evaluations are required to strengthen this evi-\ndence base. Some of this, inevitably will mean commis-\nsioning new studies, which may take some time to deliver\nresults; those who fund effectiveness evaluations might be\nencouraged to include economic analysis in their terms of\nreference for prospective applicants.\nIn the short term, another way of developing the evidence\nbase, would be to retrospectively conduct economic eval-\nuations making use of existing effectiveness data and\nattaching local estimates of resource use and costs to these\ninterventions. This practice is common in other areas of\neconomic evaluation, and some initiatives have been\nstarted to apply it in the area of MHP and MDP. Again,\ndespite all their limitations, careful use of economic mod-\nels might also help to provide some indication of the\npotential long term impact and economic consequences\nof interventions.\nIt will also be important when looking, not just at MHP or\nMDP, but all areas of health promotion and public health,\nthat innovative evaluation designs are used. Conventional\nhealth economic evaluation does not typically consider\nissues governing the uptake and appropriateness of inter-\nventions to different populations. It is important to build\ninto evaluation an assessment of the costs and resources\nrequired to implement interventions in different settings,\ncultures and contexts, and to obtain qualitative informa-\ntion on the success and obstacles to implementation. This\ntype of analysis does not typically fall within the prove-\nnance of health economists and emphasises the need for\na multi-disciplinary approach to evaluation. Much work\nremains to be done in order to gain more evidence as well\nas to foster methodological development.\nCompeting interests\nThe researchers declare their independence of funding\nand declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nIZ had the main responsibility for the research design and\ndrafting of the manuscript.
