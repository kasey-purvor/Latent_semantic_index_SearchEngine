In an attempt to eliminate, or at least to reduce the \ndivergence of beams, Bessel beams [2], and more recently Airy packets [3], have been \nemployed, where the transverse profile of the beam intensity is a non-monotonic function of \nposition. However, it is still necessary for the characteristic width of the beam to be a \nsubstantial number of wavelengths to provide something approaching non-divergent \nbehaviour over large distances. Here we demonstrate that an essentially non-divergent beam \nof terahertz radiation with a width of a few wavelengths can be produced by the use of a flat \nlens made from a metallic photonic crystal in the form of a 2-D hexagonal array of metal rods \noperating in the negative refraction regime. \n In 1968 Veselago [4] pointed out that for materials in which both the dielectric constant \u03b5 \nand the magnetic permeability \u03bc have negative values, E\u00d7H is antiparallel to the wave vector \nk. Such materials have been called left-handed materials (LHMs) in contrast to conventional \nmaterials, which can be called right-handed materials (RHMs). LHMs are also called negative \nindex materials or negative refraction materials because the negative angle of refraction that \noccurs when radiation is incident from an RHM can be formally described by Snell\u2019s law \nusing a negative refractive index. Later, it was recognized that negative refraction can occur \nnear an optical resonance in conventional material with positive magnetic permeability[5], in \nquasi-homogeneous metamaterials [6] and in photonic crystals [7-9]. Various lensing\u2013related \napplications of LHMs have been discussed, and in particular it has been shown that a flat slab \nof LHM having a refractive index of the same absolute value as the surrounding material, but \nopposite sign, acts as a superlens, providing imaging with subwavelength resolution [5,6,10]. \nHowever, in this paper we consider the case illustrated in Fig. 1 where the slab of LHM has a \nnegative refractive index n with a magnitude different from that of the surrounding RHM. The \nslab is illuminated by a point source in the 2-D plane (a line source in 3-D, parallel to the axis \nof the metallic rods in the slab).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                \nFig. 1.

(2) \n \nIt is interesting to note that if |n| < 1, the radiation incident on the slab can experience total \ninternal reflection, and only those rays for which the angle of incidence \u03b1 is smaller than a \ncritical angle \u03b1tot, given by sin \u03b1tot = |n|, can enter the slab. When \u03b1 \u2192 0 rays cross the optic \naxis near D0 = L \/|n| - A, but when the incident angle corresponds to \u03b1tot, D0 \u2192 \u221e. Hence, the \nimage of the source will not be a single point (in the 2-D plane), as would be the case if |n| = \n1, but will be stretched from the position D0  to infinity.  Since D0 can be made arbitrarily \nlarge by reducing |n|, the result suggests that it should be possible to use a slab with a negative \neffective refractive index of small magnitude to produce an essentially non-divergent beam of \nradiation from a point source in the 2-D plane. In this paper we illustrate how a non-divergent \nbeam with a width of a few wavelengths can be produced at terahertz frequencies using a slab \nin the form of a metallic photonic crystal having the required properties.  \n Figure 2 shows the bandstructure, f (k), for the two-dimensional photonic crystal \nconsidered, which is in the form of gold (plasma frequency = 8.9 eV) circular rods of diameter \n80 \u03bcm arranged in a hexagonal lattice with period 200 \u03bcm. For radiation in the E polarization, \nwith electric field parallel to the rods, such a structure exhibits an effective plasma frequency \n[11,12] of about 1 THz. The dispersion in the upper band is such that negative refraction \noccurs when radiation is incident on the crystal from vacuum [9]. In particular near the top of   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                              \nFig. 2.

Horizontal arrows indicate the \nfrequencies for which the modelling of the field pattern is shown in Fig. 3.  \n \nthe upper band the equifrequency surfaces are circular and the group velocity and the \nPoynting vector averaged over a unit cell are antiparallel to the Bloch wavevector. It follows \nthat when radiation is incident on the photonic crystal, the conditions of continuity of \ntransverse wavevector and flow of energy away from the interface and into the crystal require \na negative angle of refraction. Further, straightforward trigonometry shows that the negative \nrefraction can be described by a scalar effective refractive index n = -k( f )\/k0 where k( f ) and k0 \nare the magnitudes of the wavevectors at frequency f in the photonic crystal and the vacuum \nrespectively.  Also, k( f ) decreases as the frequency is increased, and near the top of the band \nthe effective refractive index can be very small in magnitude, making large values of  D0  \npossible [13]. \n Figures 3(a-c) show the 2-D field patterns formed by a flat slab of photonic crystal of \nthickness L = 1200 \u03bcm irradiated with line sources (perpendicular to the plane shown) of \nfrequencies 1.621 THz, 1.667 THz and 1.715 THz placed at a distance A = 1.8 mm to the right \n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\nf, T\nH\nz\n-0.5 0 X\u0393Jn\neff \n1.715 THz\n1.621 THz\n1.667 THz\n#98744 - $15.00 USD Received 11 Jul 2008; revised 29 Aug 2008; accepted 29 Aug 2008; published 2 Sep 2008\n(C) 2008 OSA 15 September 2008 \/ Vol. 16,  No. 19 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  14584\nof the structure.

[15] for the dielectric structures they \nconsidered. The collimation there is a result of the existence of a straight-line section of the \nequifrequency contours, meaning that the group velocity is in the same direction for a range of \ndifferent wavevectors. In the present case, with essentially circular equifrequency contours, \nthe collimation of the beam and the form of the side lobes are a consequence of the detailed \ninterference effects at the particular frequency. \n The red and green lines in Fig. 4 show the beam profiles when the source is separated \nfrom the slab by the distances A = 4.5 mm and A = 5.3 mm respectively. It is apparent that the \nwidth of the beam is not increased in proportion to A, as would be expected on purely \ngeometrical grounds, and in fact for all three source distances considered, the parameters of \nthe non-diffracting beam differ only slightly (although when the distance is smaller than 1 \nmm, results not shown here demonstrate that the divergence of the beam becomes \nsignificantly more pronounced).  However, the data in Table 1 do show a clear increase in the \nwaist of the beam with decreasing angle of total reflection, which is the opposite to what \nwould be expected on geometrical grounds. These results can be explained, at least intuitively, \nby a Fourier argument where the width of the beam is determined by the spread of its \ntransverse wavevectors within the slab, which in turn is determined principally by sin \u03b1tot . \nThen, as \u03b1tot is decreased, the wavevector spread is decreased and, through the usual Fourier \nrelationship, there is an increase in the beam width in real space. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 4.
