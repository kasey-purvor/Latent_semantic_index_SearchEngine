Introduction 56 \n 57 \nAlthough current interest in the ecotoxicity of mercury is mainly focused on the 58 \nbioaccumulative form methylmercury, inorganic mercury - Hg(II) - is also a significant 59 \nenvironmental pollutant.  The inorganic form of the metal exerts direct toxic effects towards a 60 \nvariety of organisms including microbes, invertebrates and plants.  Protection of soil 61 \necosystems against these toxic effects can be based on Critical Limits (or Environmental 62 \nQuality Standards), expressed as soil concentrations of Hg(II) above which unacceptable 63 \neffects are expected.  In work on Critical Loads of heavy metals, De Vries et al. (2007) 64 \nadopted a soil Critical Limit of 0.5 \u00b5g (g organic matter)\n-1\n based on the results of long-term 65 \n(several years) experiments with Hg(II) added to the O horizons of Swedish forest soils 66 \n(Bringmark and Bringmark, 2001a,b).  This limit was used to estimate Hg Critical Loads for 67 \neffects on European soil ecosystems (Hettelingh et al., 2006), and the results indicate Critical 68 \nLoad exceedance for 85% of the area of Europe.  69 \nThe Critical Limit for Hg(II) used by De Vries et al. (2007) was derived differently 70 \nfrom limits for other metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb), for which experimental chronic (NOEC, EC10) 71 \ntoxicity data have been assembled and analysed using the Species Sensitivity Distribution 72 \n(SSD) concept (e.g. Crommentuijn et al., 1997).  The work described here was performed in 73 \norder to derive SSD-based limits from published laboratory toxicity data for Hg(II).  We 74 \nassembled all available and acceptable published soil toxicity data for Hg(II) and analysed 75 \nthem to derive Critical Limits based on the maximum information.  The limit values were set 76 \nat the 5% level, i.e. protective of 95% of soil organisms (see e.g. Posthuma et al., 2003; Van 77 \nStraalen and Denneman, 1989).  Our main purpose in conducting this work was to obtain 78 \nCritical Limits that can be used to quantify the possible effects of atmospherically-deposited 79 \nHg on natural and semi-natural ecosystems.  However, the values should be generally 80 \napplicable. 81 \n We used three methods to express Hg(II) toxicity.  Firstly we followed the 82 \nconventional approach and expressed the end-points in terms of the soil metal content (\u00b5g g\n-\n83 \n1\n), with no account taken of possible dependence on soil organic matter (SOM) content or pH.  84 \nThe second method is a variant in which the results are expressed in terms of the Hg:SOM 85 \nratio, following de Vries et al. (2007).  Meili (1991) argued that this should be preferred 86 \nbecause of the well-established strong interaction of Hg(II) with organic matter, and the 87 \nstrong parallels between Hg(II) adsorption to SOM and its uptake by organisms.   88 \n02\/08\/2010 Hg(II) toxicity in soils_SECOND REVISION 4 \nThe third approach followed that of Lofts et al. (2004), who described toxic effects not 89 \nin terms of the total metal added to the soil, but the metal free ion concentration in soil 90 \nsolution.  They derived Critical Limit Functions, in which the logarithm of the critical free ion 91 \nconcentration was expressed as a linear function of pH.  Although this does not involve an  92 \nexplicit mechanism of toxicity, it is consistent with the idea that toxic response is elicited by a 93 \nquasi-complexation mechanism in which the reactivity of the metal, expressed through the 94 \nfree ion concentration, is a pH-dependent measure of toxicity.  This takes bioavailability into 95 \naccount in a simple way, as is thought desirable (Peijnenburg et al., 2002; Janssen et al., 96 \n2003); there is much current interest in relating metal toxic effects to the chemistry of the 97 \nmetals in the solution phase by which exposure occurs.  Lofts et al. (2004) used pedotransfer 98 \nfunctions to estimate free metal ion concentrations in soil solution for published toxicity 99 \nexperiments.  These functions were multiple regression equations that were derived from 100 \nanalysis of metal concentrations in the solutions of soils of differing pH, organic matter 101 \ncontent and heavy metal content (Tipping et al., 2003).  Because such pedotransfer functions 102 \nare not currently available for Hg(II), we used the WHAM chemical speciation model 103 \n(Tipping, 1994; 1998) to estimate Hg\n2+\n concentrations, denoted by [Hg\n2+\n].   104 \n 105 \n106 \n02\/08\/2010 Hg(II) toxicity in soils_SECOND REVISION 5 \n2.  Methods 107 \n 108 \n2.1  Toxicity data   109 \nToxicity data were accepted for analysis if they met the following criteria set out by Lofts et 110 \nal. (2004).  111 \n(i) Only tests carried out in soils were accepted. Tests carried out in other media (e.g. 112 \nagar, nutrient solution) were not used.  113 \n(ii) The exposed organism was of a species living in intimate contact with and considered 114 \nto take up metal directly from the pore water (e.g. earthworms and other soft-bodied 115 \ninvertebrates, plants, and soil microorganisms).  116 \n(iii) The metal was added singly to the soil in a soluble form. In all the tests accepted, the 117 \nform of mercury added was HgCl2.  118 \n(iv) The pH and organic carbon or organic matter content of the soil were quoted or 119 \nreferenced. Where organic carbon alone was quoted it was converted to organic matter by 120 \nmultiplying by 2.0.  Measured pH values were converted from values obtained by soil 121 \nextraction (using H2O, KCl or CaCl2) to soil solution pH using the equations given by de 122 \nVries et al. (2005).  123 \n(v) Chronic effect endpoints were used.  For plants, data were available for growth (yield) 124 \nand reproduction, and for soil-dwelling invertebrates reproduction rate.  For microbes there 125 \nwere measurements of enzymatic activity, rates of soil processes (e.g. respiration, 126 \nnitrification), and changes in Operational Taxonomic Units.   127 \n(vi) The endpoint metal concentration was taken to be the added Hg concentration. As 128 \nnoted by Lofts et al. (2004), the optimal Hg pool would be the 'geochemically active' 129 \nconcentration since this controls the solution free ion concentration. However the 130 \ngeochemically active concentration of metal is rarely measured in toxicity tests so for 131 \nconsistency the added metal concentration was used. Since it is highly likely that Hg 132 \nundergoes fixation in soil solids following addition in soluble form, the added metal 133 \nconcentration represents an upper limit to the geochemically active concentration.  134 \n(vii) End point concentrations of metals (NOEC, EC10) were either quoted in the paper, 135 \ncould be clearly extracted from tables of dose-response relationships, or in the case of EC10 136 \nvalues were calculable from tabulated or graphed dose-response data. A log-logistic dose-137 \nresponse model was used to calculate EC10 values when required. A description of this model 138 \nis given by Lofts et al. (2004). 139 \n02\/08\/2010 Hg(II) toxicity in soils_SECOND REVISION 6 \nToxicity data were assembled from the published literature and from new results for 140 \nsoil microorganisms, obtained from experiments with Swiss soils (see Supplementary 141 \nContent). 142 \n 143 \n2.2  Chemical speciation modelling 144 \nCalculations of soil and water chemical speciation were performed using WHAM (Tipping, 145 \n1994) incorporating Humic Ion-Binding Model VI (Tipping, 1998).  Model VI uses a 146 \nstructured formulation of discrete, chemically-plausible, binding sites for protons, in order to 147 \nallow the creation of regular arrays of bidentate and tridentate binding sites for metals.  Metal 148 \naquo ions (Al\n3+\n, Fe\n3+\n, Hg\n2+\n etc.) and their first hydrolysis products (AlOH\n2+\n, FeOH\n2+\n, HgOH\n+\n 149 \netc.) compete with each other, and with protons, for binding.  The same intrinsic equilibrium 150 \nconstant (KMA) for binding to carboxyl or type A groups is assumed to apply to the aquo ion 151 \nand its first hydrolysis product.  The constant (KMB) for binding to weaker acid groups is 152 \nrelated to KMA, and the contribution of rarer \u201csoft\u201d ligand atoms is factored in.  The intrinsic 153 \nequilibrium constants are modified by empirical electrostatic terms that take into account the 154 \nattractive or repulsive interactions between ions and the charged macromolecule.  More 155 \ninformation and parameter values are given in Table S1.  The humic ion-binding model is 156 \ncombined with an inorganic speciation model, the species list and constants for which were 157 \ngiven by Tipping (1994).  The inorganic reactions in this database are restricted to monomeric 158 \ncomplexes of metals.  The effects of ionic strength on the inorganic reactions are taken into 159 \naccount using the extended Debye-H\u00fcckel equation.  Temperature effects on reactions 160 \nbetween inorganic species are taken into account using published or estimated enthalpy data, 161 \nbut in the absence of experimental information, reactions involving humic substances are 162 \nassumed to be independent of temperature.  Tipping (1998, 2002) showed that the model can 163 \naccount for the great majority of published data sets describing either proton binding by 164 \nhumic matter or the binding of individual metals.  Results from laboratory experiments 165 \ninvolving competition for binding between metal ions and protons, and between different 166 \nmetal ions, have also been described successfully.   167 \n Soil organic matter is considered to comprise humic and fulvic acids (HA and FA), 168 \ntogether with \u201cinert\u201d organic matter.  The solution phase contains FA and inert organic 169 \nmatter.  Therefore to apply the model the amounts of the humic substances (active with 170 \nrespect to cation binding) have to be determined or assumed.  Information relevant to the 171 \npresent study has been reported by Tipping (2002) and Tipping et al. (2003).  Tipping et al. 172 \n(2003) showed that the active organic matter could be represented by a combination of humic 173 \n02\/08\/2010 Hg(II) toxicity in soils_SECOND REVISION 7 \nand fulvic acids, but their combined contribution to the total organic matter varied.  If the soil 174 \ncontained less than 45% SOM, the active binding compounds accounted on average for 0.386 175 \nof the total SOM, but for soils with SOM contents of greater than 45 %, their combined 176 \namount was 0.174 of the total soil mass (i.e. SOM and mineral matter).  These values were 177 \nused in the present work to estimate the concentrations of soil humic substances.  For soil 178 \nwater, 65% of the dissolved organic matter was assumed to be active FA (Tipping et al., 179 \n2003). 180 \n 181 \n 182 \n183 \n02\/08\/2010 Hg(II) toxicity in soils_SECOND REVISION 8 \n3.  Results and discussion 184 \n 185 \n3.1  Chemical speciation modelling of Hg(II) in soil 186 \nValues of the key parameter to describe metal binding in Model VI, log KMA, have been 187 \nestimated for Hg(II) from a range of published data from experiments with isolated humic 188 \nsubstances (Tipping, 2007).  The derived default values for the model were 3.5 and 2.9 for 189 \nHA and FA respectively (Table S1).  However, it should be noted that the experimental data 190 \nused to derive these constants were both scattered and relatively few in number, compared to 191 \nthose for most other metals to which the model has been applied (Tipping, 1998; 2002).  192 \nFurthermore, for other strongly-binding metals (e.g. Cu, Pb), the values of LKMA for HA and 193 \nFA are quite similar (Table S1), so the difference for Hg is unusual.  Consequently there is 194 \nconsiderable uncertainty in the default values for Hg(II), and some adjustments can be 195 \njustified in order to square the lab-based constants with observations relevant to the field. 196 \nThe model should be able to reproduce the distribution of Hg(II) between the solid and 197 \nsolution phases, which is mainly controlled by the distribution of dissolved and solid-phase 198 \norganic matter (Schuster, 1991).  \u00c5kerblom et al. (2008) demonstrated that in Swedish forest 199 \nsoils, the ratio of Hg to OC was very similar in solution to that in the solid phase.  The 200 \nsimilarity in Hg:OC ratios was not correctly predicted using the default log KMA values in 201 \nWHAM, because the FA value was appreciably lower than that for HA (see above), and FA is 202 \nassumed to dominate the solution OC.  To achieve the required equalisation of Hg:OC ratios 203 \nin the solid and solution phases, it was found necessary to increase the log KMA value for 204 \nHg(II)-FA binding from 2.9 to 3.5. 205 \nThe model should also provide reasonable estimates of soil solution [Hg\n2+\n].  However 206 \nestimates of this variable are scarce, reflecting the extremely low values and absence of 207 \nreliable direct methodologies.  The only relevant study is that of Skyllberg et al. (2000), who 208 \nmeasured total dissolved Hg(II) concentrations in suspensions of peat in 0.5 M NaBr, which 209 \npermitted estimation of [Hg\n2+\n] using equilibrium constants for Hg(II)-Br complexation.  We 210 \napplied WHAM \/ Model VI to the same data, and compared the predicted and experimentally 211 \nestimated [Hg\n2+\n].  The model outputs were insensitive to the value of log KMA for FA; thus, 212 \nincreasing the log KMA for FA from 2.9 to 3.5, as applied above to match Hg:OC ratios, made 213 \nlittle difference to the simulated values because binding is dominated by solid phase HA.  214 \nTherefore for consistency we used the value of 3.5.  Agreement between the measured and 215 \ncalculated values of [Hg\n2+\n] is only approximate (Table 1).  The model predicts higher 216 \nconcentrations at low pH, with better agreement at higher pH.  We examined competition due 217 \n02\/08\/2010 Hg(II) toxicity in soils_SECOND REVISION 9 \nto Al and Fe(III) by varying their assumed soil contents.  There was little dependence on the 218 \nAl concentration for typical soil levels.  Relatively large effects of Fe(III) were found.  The 219 \nresults in Table 1 are based on a solubility product (log Kso) for the reaction Fe(OH)3 + 3H\n+\n = 220 \nFe\n3+\n + 3H2O (log Kso) of 2.7 at 25\no\nC.  If a log Kso of 0.0 was assumed, agreement with the 221 \nobservations was good at low pH, but simulated [Hg\n2+\n] became too low at higher pH. 222 \nThe observations and simulations are both consistent with strong binding of Hg(II) by 223 \norganic matter and very low Hg\n2+\n concentrations in soil solution.  However the validation 224 \nattempt is clearly not fully successful, in particular with respect to the pH dependence of 225 \nHg(II) binding.  The stronger pH dependence predicted by WHAM is consistent with 226 \nobservations of Hg binding by isolated dissolved organic matter fractions covering the pH 227 \nrange 4.9 to 7.0 (Haitzer et al. 2002, 2003).  It can also be argued that modification of the 228 \nmodel on the basis of indirect estimates based on results obtained from experiments under 229 \nunnatural chemical conditions (i.e. 0.5 M NaBr) is inappropriate.  Furthermore, adjustment of 230 \nthe pH dependence of binding would require a major change to WHAM, the model assumes 231 \ncompetition between metal ions and protons, the binding of which is determined separately.  232 \nTherefore we decided not to make further model amendments, and it is applied to estimate 233 \n[Hg\n2+\n] in the soils used for toxicity experiments with caution. 234 \n  As noted, the low concentrations of Hg\n2+\n reflect the very high affinity of Hg for 235 \norganic matter.  For reference, a free ion concentration of 1.66x10\n-24\n mol l\n-1\n (the reciprocal of 236 \nAvogadro\u2019s number per litre) implies that there is on average one Hg2+ ion per litre of 237 \nsolution.  In these circumstances, the free ion concentration is a notional quantity that 238 \nprovides a link between the concentrations of quantitatively dominant species.  For example, 239 \nin a soil system at equilibrium, a conditional equilibrium constant could be defined that 240 \nrelates the concentration of Hg sorbed by solid phase organic matter to the concentration of 241 \nHg bound by dissolved organic matter, both measurable quantities.  But the same calculation 242 \nresult should be obtained by relating the interactions of both these Hg forms to the theoretical 243 \nfree ion concentration.  Thus, there is no reason to abandon the formal chemical description 244 \nbased on the free ion master species.  By the same token, Hg(II) interactions with soil 245 \norganisms can be described in terms of the reactivity of the metal, as expressed through the 246 \nfree ion concentration (see section 3.3). 247 \n 248 \n3.2  Critical Limits expressed in terms of Hg(II) soil contents 249 \nFifty-two toxicity end-points were obtained from published data, and these are summarised in 250 \nTable 2.  The results refer to five studies each with plants and invertebrates, and 42 studies of 251 \n02\/08\/2010 Hg(II) toxicity in soils_SECOND REVISION 10 \nmicrobial processes.  For this analysis we used the published end-points for all studies except 252 \nthose of Semu et al. (1985), Gudbrandsen et al. (2007), Son et al. (2007), van Faassen (1973) 253 \nand Landa and Fang (1978), and the new data reported here (see Supplementary Content), for 254 \nwhich we estimated endpoints using the log\u2013logistic dose response model used by Lofts et al. 255 \n(2004).  The data set of Table 2 represents a substantial increase in the number of data points 256 \n(18) assembled by Slooff et al (1995), and is an up-to-date compilation providing the best 257 \ncurrent basis for assessing Hg(II) toxic effects in soils.  The number of end-points is 258 \ncomparable to those used for other heavy metals (Table 3).   259 \nPlotting all the toxicity end-points expressed as \u00b5g (g soil)\n-1\n, or their logarithms,\n \n260 \nagainst either pH or SOM did not reveal any significant relationships, neither did multiple 261 \nregression combining pH and %OM.  This may reflect the differences in toxicity processes.   262 \nWelp and Brummer (1997) showed that for the same microbial process (Fe(III) reduction) in 263 \ndifferent soils the logarithm of the end-point depended significantly on both pH and %OM, 264 \nand we found that multiple regression with these variables yielded an r\n2\n of 83% (p < 0.001).  265 \nHowever, no such relationships were found in the new data reported here on other microbial 266 \nprocesses (Table 2B). 267 \nFigure 1 shows SSDs for Hg(II) plotted in terms of both \u00b5g (g soil)\n-1\n and \u00b5g (g SOM)\n-\n268 \n1\n.  There is no clear indication of different sensitivities among species or processes, although 269 \nthe results are dominated by results for microbes.  The Critical Limits are derived from the 270 \ndata by repeated bootstrap calculation of the lower 5\nth\n percentile value, values of 0.13\n \n\u00b5g (g 271 \nsoil)\n-1\n and 3.3 \u00b5g (g SOM)\n-1\n being obtained.  These values are assumed to apply under all 272 \nconditions, i.e. they do not vary with pH or any other soil variables.  Of course, the use of the 273 \nSOM-based value implies that the Critical Limit does depend upon SOM.  The Critical Limits 274 \nfor Hg(II) are substantially lower than those of other bivalent cationic metals (Table 3). 275 \nRegulatory agencies have estimated guideline soil levels of Hg, aimed at protecting 276 \neither human health or the environment.   UK soil guideline values for inorganic Hg, to 277 \nprotect human health depend upon the land-use, but the lowest value is 8 \u03bcg (g soil)-1 278 \n(Environment Agency, 2002).  The corresponding value for Canada is 6.6 \u03bcg (g soil)-1, which 279 \nis lower than the value of 12 \u03bcg (g soil)-1 that applies to environmental health (Canadian 280 \nCouncil of Ministers of the Environment, 1999).  Both are considerably greater than the 281 \ncorresponding value derived here of 0.13\n \n\u00b5g (g soil)\n-1\n.  For the Netherlands, Crommentuijn et 282 \nal. (1997) recommended a maximum permissible added content of 1.9 \u03bcg (g soil)-1 for a soil 283 \nwith 10% organic matter; our SOM-based Critical Limit would convert to 0.33  \u03bcg (g soil)-1.  284 \nIn contrast, our SOM-based value is appreciably higher than the value of 0.5 \u00b5g (g SOM)\n-1\n 285 \n02\/08\/2010 Hg(II) toxicity in soils_SECOND REVISION 11 \nsuggested by De Vries et al. (2007) on the basis of experiments on forest floor soil samples 286 \n(Bringmark and Bringmark, 2001).  As noted in the Introduction, this value of 0.5 \u00b5g (g 287 \nSOM)\n-1\n was used to determine that 85% of European sites are exceeded in the Critical Load 288 \n(Hettelingh and Sliggers, 2006). Use of our new higher value would decrease the 289 \ngeographical area for which the Critical Load is exceeded.. 290 \n 291 \n3.3  Critical Limit Function in terms of [Hg\n2+\n] and pH 292 \nWe applied WHAM \/ Model VI to estimate [Hg\n2+\n] from added Hg(II), pH and SOM content.  293 \nThe calculation required assumptions about the background electrolyte, and each soil had to 294 \nbe \u201ctitrated\u201d with either strong acid or strong base to achieve the measured pH.  The [Hg2+] 295 \nvalues finally used were obtained assuming all soils to contain 0.5 mM Ca(NO3)2 as 296 \nbackground electrolyte, with calculated additions of either Na or Cl to adjust pH.  However, 297 \nvery similar results were obtained if NaCl was used as background, and adjustments were 298 \nmade with Ca or NO3.  As discussed in Section 3.1, we set log KMA to 3.5 for both HA and 299 \nFA, and assumed log Kso = 2.7 for Fe(OH)3 solubility.  Since the toxicity data refer to added 300 \nmetal in laboratory toxicity experiments, we assume that all the metal is \u201creactive\u201d or 301 \n\u201cgeochemically active\u201d, i.e. able to participate in solid-solution partitioning, chemical 302 \nspeciation in solution, and to be bioavailable.  The estimated free ion concentrations are 303 \nincluded in Table 2, and plotted against pH in Figure 2.  The calculated values of [Hg\n2+\n] fall 304 \nin a wide range, from as low as 10\n-35\n to as high as 10\n-13\n mol l\n-1\n.  The dashed line is the median 305 \nlinear regression (p < 0.001 by bootstrapping).    306 \nThe Critical Limit Function (CLF) was calculated using an adjusted version of the 307 \nmethod used by Lofts et al. (2004).  The procedure involves firstly calculating an expression 308 \nfor the median toxicity of [Hg\n2+\n] as a function of pH and then deriving a further expression 309 \nfor the critical limit concentration of [Hg\n2+\n] by assuming the distribution of toxicity data 310 \naround the median expression to represent the distribution of sensitivities of soil organisms to 311 \nHg\n2+\n. This entailed the following steps.   312 \n(i) The toxicity dataset (comprising pairs of soil solution pH and log [Hg2+] concentrations) 313 \nwas sampled 10,000 times with replacement and slope ( ) and intercept ( ) values 314 \ncalculated using median linear regression.   315 \n(ii) For each sample, a sensitivity distribution of the regression residuals was calculated and 316 \nthe 95\u2013percentile ( ) of this distribution calculated. A value of  corresponding to the 317 \n02\/08\/2010 Hg(II) toxicity in soils_SECOND REVISION 12 \ncritical concentration of [Hg\n2+\n], was calculated as crit =  + . The critical concentration 318 \nof [Hg\n2+\n] is given by log [Hg\n2+\n]crit = .pH + crit.   319 \n(iii) Using the sampled slope and intercept parameters  and crit, 10,000 values of log 320 \n[Hg\n2+\n]crit were calculated at each of a series of pH values spanning the range found in the 321 \ntoxicological tests. The CLF was derived by linear regression of the median log [Hg\n2+\n]crit 322 \nagainst pH.  The solid line in Figure 2 represents the CLF, with  = -2.15 and crit = -323 \n17.10. 324 \nFigure 2 shows the CLF for Hg(II) and also CLFs derived for other heavy metals (Ni, Cu, Zn, 325 \nCd and Pb).  It is clear that the Hg(II) CLF falls many orders of magnitude below those of the 326 \nother metals.  The range of end-points, on the logarithmic scale, is relatively large for Hg(II).  327 \nTable 3 presents the full set of CLF parameters for six cationic metals. 328 \nThe CLF approach is empirical, but is consistent with the more mechanistic Biotic 329 \nLigand Model (Niyogi and Wood, 2004; Thakali et al., 2006), in that chemical speciation is 330 \nregarded as the key to metal interaction with organisms, and thereby to toxicity.  The free 331 \nmetal ion concentration is central to this idea, but competition with other cations, notably H\n+\n, 332 \nis also taken into account, hence the pH term in the CLF.  In the case of Hg(II) the free ion 333 \nconcentrations are very low (Table 2, Figure 2), which means that binding to both soil organic 334 \nmatter and the biota is very strong.  It is important to recognise that the free ion approach does 335 \nnot suggest that the free ion is somehow the \u201ctoxic species\u201d or the \u201cbioavailable form\u201d of the 336 \nmetal; rather, it is the main variable that predicts toxicity.  In the chemical equilibrium-based 337 \napproaches (i.e. the CLF or the Biotic Ligand Model) all the \u201creactive\u201d or \u201cgeochemically 338 \nactive\u201d metal (i.e. all metal in solution, adsorbed to soil organic matter or mineral particles, 339 \netc) is bioavailable, but the chemical reactions govern the extent to which the metal reacts 340 \nwith the organism, and therefore toxicity.  Thus, if the concentrations of other chemical 341 \nspecies are kept constant, the greater is [M\nz+\n] the greater is the extent of reaction with the 342 \norganism, and therefore the greater the toxic effect. 343 \nThe speciation modelling results (Section 3.1) showed only partial validation of the 344 \nmodel by comparison with experimentally-estimated soil [Hg\n2+\n], in particular with regard to 345 \nthe pH dependence of Hg(II) binding.  Accordingly, the derived CLF also is also uncertain 346 \nwith respect to the pH dependence.  As long as WHAM is used to estimate [Hg\n2+\n] then 347 \napplication of the CLF derived here will yield consistent results, since any errors will cancel.  348 \nBut in an absolute sense the CLF parameters are highly approximate. 349 \n 350 \n02\/08\/2010 Hg(II) toxicity in soils_SECOND REVISION 13 \n3.4  Application of the Critical Limits for Hg(II) 351 \nFor four hypothetical but representative soils differing in pH and OM content, we calculated 352 \nthe active Hg content corresponding to the three types of Critical Limit derived in the present 353 \nwork (Table 4).  For the soil-based Hg content limit of 0.13 \u00b5g g\n-1\n the value is the same in all 354 \ncases, and variation in soil properties cannot be taken into account.  The SOM-based limit of 355 \n3.3 \u00b5g g\n-1\n yields a variation of 100-fold, from 0.03 to 3.3 \u00b5g g\n-1\n.  The CLF gives similar 356 \nresults but a slightly smaller range, from 0.04 to 1.2 \u00b5g g\n-1\n.  The differences between the 357 \nSOM- and CLF-based values arise because the pH dependence of Hg(II) binding by soil 358 \ndiffers from the pH-dependence of the CLF.  These results demonstrate the superiority of 359 \napproaches that take soil properties into account; the purely soil-based Critical Limit would 360 \nbe over-protective at low pH \/ high SOM and under-protective at high pH \/ low SOM. 361 \nThe soil contents of Hg(II) at the Critical Limit refer to reactive metal, which is well-362 \ndefined for toxicity experiments in which metal salts are added to soil, and in theoretical 363 \nchemical speciation calculations, but less so when analysing samples of soils from the field.  364 \nFor the other cationic bivalent metals of Table 3, extraction with dilute acid or EDTA 365 \nprovides a reasonable estimate of reactive metal (see e.g. Tipping et al., 2003), but 366 \npreliminary studies in our laboratory (A.J. Lawlor and E.Tipping, unpublished results) 367 \nsuggest that such reagents are ineffective for Hg(II); see also Ernst et al. (2008).  The use of a 368 \nmore aggressive extractant such as aqua regia may therefore be needed to release Hg(II) from 369 \nsoils, but this could also mobilise unreactive metal that is part of parent mineral matter, 370 \nleading to overestimation of both atmospherically-deposited and bioavailable mercury (Krug 371 \nand Winstanley, 2004). 372 \n 373 \n 374 \n375 \n02\/08\/2010 Hg(II) toxicity in soils_SECOND REVISION 14 \n4. Conclusions  376 \n 377 \n(a)  Critical Limits for Hg expressed as added metal content of soil are 0.13 \u00b5g (g soil)-1 and 378 \n3.30 \u00b5g (g SOM)\n-1\n.  These are substantially lower than values derived by the same method 379 \nfor other bivalent cationic metals (Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb).   380 \n(b) The SOM-based limit is appreciably higher than the value of 0.5 \u00b5g (g SOM)-1 currently 381 \nrecommended for use in calculating Critical Loads. 382 \n(c) With Hg(II) toxicity expressed in terms of the free ion concentration, [Hg2+], estimated 383 \nusing WHAM \/ Model VI, an approximate Critical Limit Function (CLF) is derived.  This 384 \ntakes the form; log [Hg\n2+\n]crit = - 2.15 pH \u2013 17.10. 385 \n(d) The SOM-based Critical Limit and the CLF provide the best assessments of permissible 386 \nsoil levels of reactive Hg(II), which vary from c. 2 \u00b5g (g soil)\n-1\n for acid organic soil to c. 387 \n0.05 \u00b5g (g soil)\n-1\n for neutral soil low in organic matter.   388 \n 389 \n390 \n02\/08\/2010 Hg(II) toxicity in soils_SECOND REVISION 15 \nAcknowledgements 391 \nWe are grateful to L.
