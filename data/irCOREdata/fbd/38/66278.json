INTRODUCTION\nThe objective of marine seismic imaging is to reconstruct subsurface reflectivity from acoustic observations\nnormally taken near the sea surface. This can be achieved by iteratively minimizing a cost function consisting of\na data matching term and a regularization term. In seismic processing literature the procedure is usually termed\nleast-squares migration (LSM).\nLSM has been shown to be effective in optimizing the reconstruction of subsurface reflectivity, particularly\nin cases of incomplete data.1, 2 There are several cases where a data set may be incomplete: finite recording\napertures, coarse source\/receiver distribution, gaps between recording lines for 3D imaging and poor subsurface\nillumination caused by irregular ray coverage due to strong lateral variations in velocity.\nIn seismic image reconstruction applications, subsurface reflectivity is usually defined on a grid of point\nreflectors. We propose using a complex wavelet basis called the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-\nCWT)3 for the reflectivity. This introduces limited redundancy (2m:1 for m-dimensional signals) and allows the\ntransform to provide approximate shift invariance and directionally selective filters (properties lacking in the\ntraditional wavelet transform) while preserving the usual properties of perfect reconstruction and computational\nefficiency.\nWavelet bases tend to decorrelate or diagonalize a range of non-stationary signals. This has led to extensive\nuse of wavelet bases in the area of information coding and compression. In LSM, diagonalization of the model\nspace allows a more accurate and practical representation of prior information about the model parameters. This\nprior information is incorporated in the regularization term of the cost function that is minimized.\nUsing more sophisticated regularization becomes more important for missing or undersampled data problems\nor when increased resolution is required in the reflectivity model to be reconstructed. Alternatively, relaxing\nsampling requirements can reduce the cost of data acquisition.\nThe main drawback of LSM is its computational cost. It is an iterative method with a high computational\noverhead relative to some other migration schemes. In light of this, LSM is best suited to target oriented\napplications, where a smaller area or volume of interest is reconstructed after an initial reconnaissance using\nanother non-iterative migration technique.4\nM.A.M.: E-mail: mam59@cam.ac.uk, N.G.K.: E-mail: ngk@eng.cam.ac.uk, R.W.H.: E-mail:r.w.hobbs@durham.ac.uk\nComputational Imaging III, edited by Charles A.

DUAL TREE CWT\nChoosing a basis that is appropriate for the statistical characteristics of a particular class of input signal is\na classical problem. Linear transforms have proven to be popular due to their simplicity and mathematical\ntractability. The DT-CWT is a derivative of the discrete wavelet transform that generates complex coefficients\nby using a dual tree of wavelet filters to obtain their real and imaginary parts. Here the Q-shift version of the\nDT-CWT is chosen as the wavelet basis for its key advantages compared to other wavelet transforms. These are\nsummarized as follows:3\n1. Shift invariance: Eliminates aliasing defects.\n2. Good directional selectivity: The DT-CWT has six directionally selective subbands in 2 dimensions and\n28 in 3 dimensions.\n3. Basis vectors form an almost tight frame: Allows use of the transform in the efficient Conjugate Gra-\ndient Descent (CGD) algorithm.\n4. Perfect reconstruction: No distortion caused by the forward transform followed by the inverse transform.\n5. Limited redundancy: Redundancy is independent of the number of scales and limited to 2n for n dimen-\nsions.\n6. Efficient computation: Filters are separable and computation is less than 2n times that of the simple DWT\nfor n dimensions.\nThe first point is well known to provide superior denoising performance and often leads designers to use\nundecimated transforms.11, 12 However, as shown by Kingsbury the DT-CWT can outperform undecimated real\nwavelet transforms because the DT-CWT\u2019s improved directional selectivity (point 2) provides better denoising\nnear nonvertical and nonhorizontal edges or lines.11 Points 3 and 4 are important in order to avoid any noise or\nerror amplification effects when repeatedly performing forward and inverse transforms such as in the conjugate\ngradient algorithm used here. Points 5 and 6 lead to lower algorithm complexity and increased speed.\n3. SEISMIC MODELLING\nUsing the high-frequency single-scattering Born approximation the seismic data can be modeled using a gener-\nalized Radon transform:\nd = Lm + n (1)\nIn (1) d is the observed scattered acoustic data which is a function of time and acoustic source and receiver\npositions. m is the reflectivity on a regular grid in 2 or 3 dimensions and L is the linearized seismic modeling\noperator mapping from one to the other.1 Observed data not modeled by the linear operator is modeled by\nadditive noise n assumed to be Gaussian distributed with covariance Cn. Thus, equation (1) is an inverse\nproblem where the objective is to recover the reflectivity m from the observed data d.\nThe data is modeled using a ray based method where the sound velocity profile is approximated by a smooth\nbackground velocity profile plus a perturbation. Our approach is equivalent to a linearized inversion of the\nreflectivity for a given background velocity distribution. We write d = Lm as:\nd(t, p) =\n\u2211\nr\nm(r)A(r, s,g)(w\u0001\u03b6)(t\u2212 \u03c4(r, s,g)) (2)\n28     SPIE-IS&T\/ Vol. 5674\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Nov 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

The travel times are generated using the eikonal equations and the assumed\nbackground velocity field. This can be done using the open source seismic modeling program, Seismic Unix.13\nA is the amplitude of the ray incorporating geometrical spreading and an angle dependant obliquity factor.14\nLT is the equivalent matrix transpose of (2), so we write mKirch = LTd as:\nmKirch(r) =\n\u2211\np\n\u2211\nt\nd(t, p)A(r, s,g)(w\u0001\u03b6)(t\u2212 \u03c4(r, s,g)) (3)\nEquation (3) forms the basis of the current standard industry approach to seismic imaging known as Kirchhoff\nmigration. In this approach LT is used to approximate L\u22121.\n3.1. Computational Aspects of L and LT\nAssuming that the size of the (2D) model m is Nx\u00d7Nz and there are Np recorded waveforms (traces) and Nt time\nsamples per trace so that d is of length NpNt, then brute force matrix multiplication by L or LT would require\napproximately NxNzNpNt operations. This is likely to be unacceptably large. Fortunately L may be regarded\nas the cascade of a sparse matrix multiplication and a relatively efficient convolution process, summarized as\nfollows.\nIn equation (2) we see that each point in the model m excites each recorded waveform with a band-limited\nimpulse of short duration, at a point determined by the total propagation delay from source to receiver via that\npoint in m, \u03c4 . In applying L these short pulses may be added to the traces in turn, and only affect a proportion\n\u03b1 of the total traces in which the path delay lies within the range of delays being measured in d. Interpolated\npulse waveforms are used to synthesize fractional sample delays and the pulses are Ns samples long. Each pulse\nis scaled by an appropriate attenuation coefficient, dependent on the path. This all requires approximately\n\u03b1NxNzNsNp operations.\nEach trace is then convolved with the combined source wavelet and wavelet shaping factor. This is typically\nperformed in the frequency domain and requires of order NpNt log2(Nt) operations, significantly less processing\nthan the previous step.\nThus, L is the cascade of a sparse matrix multiplication and a relatively efficient convolution process. Hence\nthe total processing is of order NsNxNzNp operations. Note that this is much greater than the DT-CWT of the\nmodel, which is approximately 100NxNz operations in 2D. Applying the adjoint operator LT to d requires the\nsame amount of computation as applying the forward operator.\n4. BAYESIAN INVERSION USING A WAVELET BASIS\nExpressing the reflectivity using wavelet basis functions by substituting m = Pw in (1) results in equation (4).\nd = LPw + n (4)\nIn (4) w are the lexographically ordered wavelet coefficients whose real and imaginary parts are treated as\nseparate variables. Starting with equation (4), we derive in a Bayesian framework a cost function which when\nminimized provides a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate for the wavelet coefficients w. The conditional\nprobability for the data given the wavelet coefficients is:\npd|w(d|w) = 1(2\u03c0 |Cn|)1\/2 exp\n{\n\u22121\n2\n(LPw \u2212 d)T Cn\u22121 (LPw \u2212 d)\n}\n(5)\nSPIE-IS&T\/ Vol. 5674     29\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Nov 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

Our prior model for the wavelet coefficients assumes the\nreal and imaginary parts have independent Gaussian distributions with zero mean and known variance. Thus\nf(w) becomes:\nf(w) = wTCw\u22121w (7)\nand we obtain an estimate for the wavelet coefficients by minimizing:\nEw(w) = (LPw \u2212 d)T Cn\u22121 (LPw \u2212 d) + wTCw\u22121w (8)\nWe compare this to the case where a wavelet basis is not used. The relevant cost function is:\nEm(m) = (Lm\u2212 d)T Cn\u22121 (Lm\u2212 d) + f(m) (9)\nbut a representative f(m) is now more difficult to define.\nAs stated in section 3 traditional migration in its most basic form is equivalent to estimating the reflectivity\nby applying the transpose of the forward modeling operator to the observed data. Note that this is equivalent\nto one iteration of a steepest descent or conjugate gradient minimization procedure like that described here.\n5. ALGORITHM\nWe now turn to the implementation of the algorithm. To speed up convergence and allow estimation of the\ncoefficient variances, we start with a non-iterative estimate for the reflectivity. If the available estimate m\u02dc0 is\nnot scaled correctly, it is multiplied by \u03bb that minimizes Em(\u03bbm\u02dc0) with f(m) = 0, so that m0 = \u03bbm\u02dc0. This is\nequivalent to performing one iteration of steepest descent minimization of (9) with m\u02dc0 as the search direction\nand no regularization or preconditioning.\nFollowing De Rivaz and Kingsbury10 the coefficient variances are allowed to vary within each subband but\nare the same for the real and imaginary parts of a given coefficient. These variances are estimated from the\nforward DT-CWT of the initial reflectivity estimate w0 = PTm0 as \u03c32i = 0.5|wi|2 where wi is the corresponding\ncomplex wavelet coefficient in w0.\nThe algorithm is initialized with w0 and the energy function (8) is minimized using a preconditioned CGD\nalgorithm optimized to use the minimum number of forward and transpose seismic modeling operators per\niteration (one of each), since these operations comprise the bulk of the computational effort. A block diagram\nillustrating the algorithm implementation is displayed in figure 1. Figure 1(a) shows the preprocessing as detailed\nin this section, while figure 1(b) contains the optimized conjugate gradient loop, where the steepest descent\ndirection is updated at each iteration rather than recalculated from scratch.\nAfter sufficient iterations the reflectivity estimate is found by applying the inverse wavelet transform to the\ncurrent coefficient estimate:\nm\u02c6 = Pw\u02c6k (10)\nNote that the matrices P and PT required in the conjugate gradient algorithm are not implemented as matrix\nmultiplications but using much faster wavelet decomposition and reconstruction algorithms.\n30     SPIE-IS&T\/ Vol. 5674\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Nov 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

Block diagram of the complex wavelet seismic imaging system\nAn area where the use of a wavelet basis makes the inversion more difficult is the preconditioning of the\nsystem. To speed up convergence, CGD algorithms used to solve linear inversion problems are preconditioned\nby scaling the variables prior to minimization. In its usual form the diagonal elements of the Hessian of the\ncost function \u00012E need to be calculated, so that they can be scaled to unity by the preconditioning. For the\nnon-wavelet cost function (9), ignoring the regularization term (f(m) = 0), the Hessian is:\n\u00012Ew = LTCn\u22121L (11)\nHowever, for wavelet based inversion this becomes:\n\u00012Em = PTLTCn\u22121LP (12)\nCalculating the diagonal elements of (12) is more difficult. Fortunately, for preconditioning the exact values\nare not required and a rough estimate is sufficient. The computational effort required to obtain these values\ncan be significantly reduced by using heavy interpolation of the wavelet subbands, taking advantage of the small\nsupport of most of the wavelet basis functions, and by decimation of the trace locations for large data sets.\n6. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\n6.1. Synthetic Data\nThe synthetic data shown in figure 3 was generated using Seismic Unix.13 This sparse dataset consists of six\ncommon shot gathers spaced at 300m with 30 traces (lines of data for particular source\/geophone combinations)\nin each gather. The maximum offset from source to receiver in each gather is 1500m. The background velocity\nfield is linearly increasing with depth from 1500ms\u22121 at depth 0 at a rate of 0.8ms\u22121 per meter. The reflectors\nused to generate the data are displayed in figure 3(a).\nSeismic Unix Kirchhoff depth migration is used to obtain an initial estimate of the reflectivity. The Kirchhoff\nmigrated section is shown in figure 3(b). LSM with complex wavelets is now applied to the problem and the\nresult after 10 iterations is displayed in figure 3(c).\nSPIE-IS&T\/ Vol. 5674     31\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Nov 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

Synthetic data generated using Seismic Unix\n6.2. Gippsland Basin Data\nThe data used in the following results are from a 3-D survey acquired in 2001 over the offshore Gippsland Basin\nnear Australia. A single shot\/streamer line was selected from the data volume to test the complex wavelet\nleast-squares migration algorithm in 2 dimensions. From this 14216 traces with source\/receiver midpoints along\na length of 2km above the area to be imaged are used.\nThe noise covariance matrix is assumed to be diagonal and the noise variances are estimated directly from\nthe trace data. The estimates consist of two components. The first, which models background noise due to\nincoherent scatterers, was picked roughly by hand, with variance estimates decaying with time and slowly with\nsource\/receiver offset. The second is proportional to a windowed average of the data values squared along each\ntrace. This component models the modeling error which is assumed to be roughly proportional to the data at\nsimilar travel times.\nFor our results we used the Kirchhoff based estimate m\u02dc0 = R\u22121LTCn\u22121d to initialize the algorithm, where\nR is diagonal with diagonal entries Rii equal to those of the Hessian of the non-wavelet LSM cost function with\nno constraint term, i.e. Rii = [LTCn\u22121L]ii. We demonstrate the algorithm\u2019s ability to cope with undersampled\ndata by using a reduced data set where the traces are decimated by a factor of 10. In the absence of any ground\ntruth data, we compare the result to the Kirchhoff based estimate obtained using the full data set. As for the\nsynthetic data, we compare the result to that obtained with non-wavelet least-squares migration using the cost\nfunction in (9) with the regularization defined as f(m) = mT C\u22121m m, where Cm = \u03c3\n2\nmI.\nFigure 4 displays the results for an approximately 1.7km wide by 0.8km deep target area. Figure 4(a) contains\nthe Kirchhoff estimate for the decimated data used to initialize the complex wavelet system. Noise and so called\nmigration artifacts are visible due to the sparsity of the data. Our pseudo ground-truth data, the Kirchhoff\nreconstruction using the full data set in figure 4(c), suppresses much although not all of the noise seen in the\n32     SPIE-IS&T\/ Vol. 5674\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Nov 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

Results for the synthetic data generated in Seismic Unix\nreconstruction using the decimated data. The result for the complex wavelet system on the decimated data\nin figure 4(b) is seen to significantly suppress noise and reduce migration artifacts seen in figure 4(a) while\nenhancing reflectors.\nThe non-wavelet iterative algorithm (figure 4(d)) also enhances the subsurface reflectors but is not as well\nregularized and does not suppress noise and artifacts as well as the complex wavelet system. The non-wavelet\nalgorithm diverges in just a few iterations if no regularization is employed. The results for the complex wavelet\nsystem presented here are stable i.e. continuing for more iterations brings increasingly smaller updates to the\nestimate and the reflectivity estimate does not diverge.\n7.
