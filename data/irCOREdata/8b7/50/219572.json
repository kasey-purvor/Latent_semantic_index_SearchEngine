It is true that climate change is a separate agenda, the preserve of a distinct \nacademic and epistemic community, scholarly discourse, policy community, institutional \nstructures and modes of governance; but the linkages between these two issues \u2013 \nclimate change and its policy corollaries, and the \u2018traditional\u2019 domain of social policies \u2013 \nseem to us so strong and salient that they should be aired in a social policy journal. \n \nSocial policy is often conceived as the public management of social risks (Esping-\nAndersen 1999: 36). Some of these risks are timeless and universal, such as ill health, \nothers are specific to certain types of society, such as unemployment or ethnic \ndiscrimination, others are more ephemeral. Climate change is a new risk that is big, \nglobal, long-term, persistent and uncertain (Stern 2006: 25). It thus confronts us with a \nqualitatively new agenda in social policy, or so I shall argue. Its implications for, and \nlinkages with, economic policy are now centre-stage, yet there is very little on the \nlinkages with social policy \u2013 for example, there is no reference to \u2018social policy\u2019 in the \nindex of the 800-page Fourth Assessment Report (on Mitigation of Climate Change) of \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007). \n \nThe bald facts and high-consensus predictions of climate change are by now well-known \nand can be briefly stated. Most climate change models predict a doubling of pre-\nindustrial levels of greenhouse gases between 2030 and 2060, which would result in a \nrise of global mean temperatures by between 2-5\u00b0C. The higher range would be far \noutside the experience of human civilisation and comparable to the difference between \ntemperatures during the last ice age and today. Whatever is done now, because of \ninertia in the climate system past emissions of greenhouse gases will drive increases in \nglobal mean temperature for another several decades. Furthermore most of these \nmodels do not take account of likely positive feedbacks which will amplify the \ntemperature rise. Alongside global warming the direct effects in the coming decades will \ninclude increasing risk of droughts and floods, more abrupt and large-scale changes in \nthe climate systems and a rise in sea levels.  \n \nMost models predict significantly greater direct negative impacts on human habitats and \nlivelihoods in tropical regions, which are also mainly poorer countries. This is of \noverwhelming importance in global debates. However, we shall restrict ourselves here to \n                                                 \n1 Thanks to Graham Room and Traute Meyer, for earlier discussions, ideas and drafts \nabout the whole issue of climate change and social policy, and for much subsequent \neditorial advice. Thanks also to Anna Coote for helpful discussions and comments. \n 2 \nthe implications for wellbeing, social risks and social policies in Europe. These fall into \nfour categories.  \n1. Direct risks: Mediterranean regions will see rising water stress, heat waves and \nforest fires, and coastal regions of Europe are vulnerable to rising sea-levels, \nnotably the Netherlands. However, more northerly countries may benefit. \n2. Indirect risks: including greater distress migration from tropical regions, notably \nAfrica, into Europe, recently highlighted by the EU\u2026. \n3. Implications of climate change adaptation policies: there may be greater fiscal \ncompetition from necessary environmental policies to adapt to climate change, \nsuch as sea defences and removing housing from flood plains. \n4. Implications of climate change mitigation policies: these include carbon budgets \nand\/or higher carbon taxes and prices in the rich world which would be \nnecessary to stabilise carbon emissions in the second half of the century. \n \nA new research strategy should be aware of all four. In particular, new concerns with \nsocial justice and social policy are raised by the pressures (moral and practical) to \ndrastically curb carbon emissions in Europe alongside the rest of the rich world. It is the \nnexus between environmental and social policies that needs to be urgently explored. \nThis symposium bgins to rehearse the implications of climate change and climate \nchange policies for the established ideas and practices of social policy and welfare \nstates. After introducing the contributors the remainder of this introduction considers in \nturn the conceptual, empirical, policy and governance implications of climate change for \nsocial policy in contemporary Europe.  \n \nThe contributors  \n \nWe have deliberately invited short contributions to this symposium from experts in \nclimate change and environmental policy outside the field of social policy: from political \nscience, sociology and economics. \nJames Meadowcroft holds the Canada Research Chair in Governance for Sustainable \nDevelopment at Carleton University, Canada. He researches the ways in which \ngovernments are (or are not) adjusting their practices and policies in the face of \nemerging environment problems in order to promote more sustainable patterns of \nsocietal development. His publications include Implementing Sustainable Development: \nStrategies and Initiatives in High Consumption Societies (2000a) and \u2018From welfare state \nto ecostate?\u2019 (2005). In this contribution he compares the emergence of the \nenvironmental state with the earlier emergence of the welfare state. He considers a \nrange of linkages between social and environmental policies today, concluding that they \nhave the potential to draw together and reinstate the original impulse behind the idea of \n\u2018sustainable development\u2019. \nJohn Dryzek is Professor of Political Science at the Australian National University. His \nwork in environmental politics ranges from green political philosophy to studies of \nenvironmental discourses and movements. His many publications include Green States \nand Social Movements: Environmentalism in the United States, United Kingdom, \nGermany, and Norway (2003) and The Politics of the Earth (2005). In this contribution he \nargues that coordinated market economies with social democratic welfare states tend to \nsee economic and ecological values as mutually reinforcing, and are best placed to \nnavigate the challenge presented by climate change to social policy. Liberal market \neconomies with less developed welfare states tend to oppose environmental and \n 3 \neconomic values and will face greater difficulties. Yet in the longer term, new forms of \ngovernance for climate change may undermine traditionally state-centric forms of social \npolicy. \n \nJ\u00fcrgen Gerhards is Professor of Macrosociology at the Free University of Berlin, \nGermany. His main research concerns the cultural aspects of European integration and  \nthe value attitudes of European citizens. His publications include Cultural Overstrech? \nDifferences between old and new member states of the EU and Turkey (2007). Holger \nLengfeld is Professor of Sociology of Contemporary Societies at the University of Hagen, \nGermany. He researches social justice, social inequality and attitudes towards European \nintegration and his publications include Organisierte Ungleichheit: Wie Organisationen \nLebenschancen beeinflussen (Organised Inequality: How Organisations influence life \nchances, 2007). Here they provide an empirical study addressing two issues: the \npioneering role of the EU in environmental policy, and the degree of support of EU \ncitizens for the ideas of environmental protection.  \n \nAnil Markandya is currently Professor of Economics at the University of Bath, UK and \nDirector of Applied Research in FEEM, Italy, and recently served as Lead Economist at \nthe World Bank. He has published widely in the areas of climate change, environmental \nvaluation, environmental policy, energy and environment, and green accounting.  He \nwas a lead author for Chapters of the 3rd and 4th IPCC Assessment Reports on Climate \nChange, which were awarded a share of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.  Ramon Ortiz \nworks with him as Research Officer in Environmental Economics at Bath University. \nThey undertake an empirical survey of the impact of carbon taxation on social \ninequalities, concluding that these would be mildly regressive, but manageable, in the \nEuropean context. \nThis introduction and the following contributions are intended to sketch out some of the \nways that climate change will impinge on social policy in the coming years and to \nsuggest a framework for research. We invite readers to take up this challenge. It may \nprovide the topic for a Special Issue in the future.  \n \nConceptual challenges \nIf social policy is the public management of social risks, are the risks posed by climate \nchange qualitatively different to those addressed by conventional social policies? There \nare certainly similarities as Meadowcroft notes: \u2018Both are political responses to long term \nsocietal change related to industrialization, urbanization and democratization. Both have \nbeen called into being to wrestle with issues that cannot adequately be addressed by \nmarkets and voluntary action. And both shift patterns of \u2018normal\u2019 economic interaction \n(through regulation, fiscal transfers, and so on), while operating within significant \neconomic and political constraints\u2019. Both also generate conflicts about the distribution of \nresources (witness the commitment to bio-fuels fuelling a record rise in world grain \nprices). These parallels may suggest that CC could be absorbed as an emerging risk \ninto the corpus of social policies. In welfare states it could enter the political settlement \nas part of the collective responsibilities of governments. In existing welfare state regimes \nit may reconfigure the roles of states, markets and families, but it would not define a \ndistinct new regime. \n 4 \nAnother fruitful way of understanding the emergence and nature of \u2018social policy\u2019 in \nWestern nations is as a reaction to capitalism and the commodification of labour power. \nSeizing on Marx\u2019s insight, Karl Polanyi regarded labour as a \u2018fictitious commodity\u2019. While \nit must be organised in markets, and while these markets are an absolutely vital part of \nthe economic system, labour is not a commodity because it is not produced for sale and \n\u2018cannot be detached from the rest of life\u2019 (Polanyi 1944\/1957: 72). Thus social policies \nemerged in the 19c, piecemeal and in a wide variety of forms, to cope with the \nunplanned, humanly harmful and system-threatening effects of the commodification of \nlabour: \u2018The extension of the market organization in respect to genuine commodities was \naccompanied by its restriction in respect to fictitious ones\u2019 (p.76). This has given rise to \nthe concept of \u2018de-commodification\u2019 as a measure of the counter-movement of social \npolicy, in the work of Esping-Andersen and others. \n \nHowever, Polanyi identified two other fictitious commodities alongside Labour: Money \nand Land. The supply and regulation of money has for centuries been a central function \nof nation states. The ownership and regulation of land has also been central to feudalism \nand capitalism, but Polanyi is concerned with something much wider, since Land \u2018is only \nanother name for nature, which is not produced by man\u2019 (p.72). It is clear now that the \ncommodification of land, natural resources, the oceans and nature generates collective \n\u2018bads\u2019 which stretch out over space and time and which \u2018call forth\u2019 (to use Polanyi\u2019s \nphrase) a variety of societal responses. Climate change is the latest and most egregious \nexample. In the 21st century it is likely that this will dominate policy-making in a parallel \nway to the \u2018labour question\u2019 in the 19th and 20th centuries in the West. This suggests \nanother conceptual parallel: just as the \u2018social question\u2019 fostered the welfare state, now \nthe climate threat is fostering the rise of the \u2018environmental state\u2019 or \u2018eco-state\u2019, as \ndiscussed by Dryzek and Meadowcroft. \n \nBut these parallels are weak, others argue. The risks addressed by social policies are \ntypically individually unpredictable but collectively predictable; those of climate change \nare collectively unpredictable. The Stern Report (2007: 25) points out that CC is global in \nits causes and consequences; its impacts are long-term and persistent; and there is \nserious risk of major, irreversible impacts with non-marginal economic and social effects. \nFurthermore, the uncertainties over the probability distributions of likely outcomes are \ngreat. According to some theories of uncertainty this itself argues for an explicit \n\u201cprecautionary principle\u201d (2007: 38): an additional \u2018aversion to uncertainty\u2019 in addition to \nstandard \u2018aversion to risk\u2019 as a basis for public policies. This is because of the strong \nasymmetry between unexpectedly fortunate and unexpectedly bad outcomes (2007: \n328). The implications are that the risks of CC are quantitatively and qualitatively distinct \nfrom traditional risks which in the past have fostered the emergence of social policy \nresponses. \nFurthermore, the consequences (externalities) of early industrialisation were visible and \ndirectly felt by many people, which fostered collective organizations and social \nmovements to correct them. In contrast the externalities of climate change are distant in \ntime and global in space; the material bases for collective mobilisations are weaker. \nThese and other theoretical concerns suggest a conceptual separation between \ntraditional social policy and the set of environmental policies addressing climate change. \nBut the linkages between the two are critical and of growing salience.  \n \nHowever, we may note one other conceptual parallel between the two \u2013 the distinction \nbetween adaptive and mitigating policies. Adaptation refers to \u2018measures to reduce the \n 5 \nvulnerability of natural and human systems against actual or expected climate change \neffects\u2019, while mitigation refers to \u2018policies to reduce GHG emissions and enhance sinks\u2019 \n(IPCC Glossary; see also Stern 2007: 346). There are certain parallels between this \ndistinction and an earlier one between protective and productive social policy: whether to \naccept the quantum of human capital or to invest in increasing it, whether to accept and \nprotect against unemployment or pursue demand- and supply-side interventions to \nreduce it, whether to adapt to \u2018sink estates\u2019 and minimise their harmful effects or to \ninvest in community development, and so on (Room 2000). Since the 1930s the \nproductive role of social policy has been recognised, though it took back stage during \nthe 1980s when the \u2018burden\u2019 model was promulgated by neo-liberal economists and \npolicy-makers. Meadowcroft sees a potential role for such productive social policies to \nmobilise societal resources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n \nEmpirical questions \n \nClimate change is likely to exacerbate social inequalities, lines of conflict and patterns of \nmigration. These repercussions need to be explored empirically from a European \nperspective. The table below develops a four-fold analysis of CC implications for social \npolicy and gives examples. This suggests some of the dimensions of the future research \nagenda (policy implications are further considered in the next section). \n \nMapping the impacts of climate change in Europe \n Predicted effects: \nexamples  \nSocial policy implications: examples \n1. Direct impact of \nforecast climate \nchange up to \n2050 \nModest direct impact, \nmore adverse in coastal \nareas, Mediterranean \nregions. \nPrecautionary policies on housing and \nsettlements, new insurance costs, \nhealth demands of extreme climate \nevents \n2. Indirect impact \nof forecast climate \nchange up to \n2050 \nClimate migration from \ndeveloping world \nNew demands for housing, jobs, \neducation, health services and social \nprotection (but offsetting benefits from \nyounger age groups?). Challenges to \nsocial integration. \n3. Impact of likely \nCC adaptation \npolicies  \nOpportunity costs of \nmaking settlements and \nbuildings more resilient \nto CC \nFiscal competition between welfare \nstate and environmental state, unless \nsynergies are exploited \n4. Impact of \npotential CC \nmitigation policies  \nHigher energy costs in \nproduction, electricity, \ntravel, housing. \n \n \n \nRestrictions on \nconsumption patterns.  \nRegressive effects of carbon taxes and \npricing and new energy policies: \nimplications for social protection. \nNew social investment demands to \nreduce carbon emissions of housing, \ntransport and employment. \nNumerous policies to change \nconsumption behaviour. \n \nThese questions must also be interpreted in light of a central concern of social policy, \nboth as practical action and academic study: the equity, fairness or justice of particular \npolicy outcomes, the distribution of costs and burdens between social groups, and the \ncase for redistributive public policies. I consider two dimensions of distribution here \u2013 \n 6 \nregional and socio-economic \u2013 though many more should be considered, including \ngender and age. \nRegional differences across Europe mainly apply to 1 and 2: direct and indirect impacts \nof CC itself. There is a clear north-south gradient in the impact of CC on water supplies, \nfood production and health (Stern 2007 ch5). In Europe, the burden of warming and of \ndistress migration is likely to impact mainly the Mediterranean countries, as evidenced \nthe European heat wave of 2003 and the high rates of illegal immigration in countries \nsuch as Greece. \nSocio-economic equity is raised by both CC impacts and policies. In the developed \nworld, the poorest will be on average more vulnerable to CC for various reasons: lower \nincome households are more likely to live in higher-risk areas, marginal lands and \nfloodplains; they have fewer resources to cope and have much lower rates of insurance \ncover; they may also suffer from poorer health and resistance (Stern 2007: 148). \nHowever, the impacts of CC mitigation policies may be still greater. It would appear at \nfirst sight that essential policies to ration carbon emissions by whatever means would \nhurt the richest, higher-consumption households the most. Ceteris paribus \u2018contract and \nconverge\u2019 strategies should equalise living standards. However, the immediate overall \nimpact of carbon taxes in the EU would be regressive, as Markandya and Ortiz show \nbelow.  \n \nThe distributive consequences need careful research within policy areas, perhaps most \nnotably in housing. For example, in the United Kingdom, 30% of the poorest quintile of \nhouseholds use more energy than the national average, mainly because they live in \nsuch fuel-inefficient houses (Monbiot 2006: 47; Ekins and Dresner 2004). Thus a fair \ncarbon-rationing scheme requires complementary social policies, both to invest in low-\nemission housing, transport and communities, and to protect those on low incomes. \nBuilding standards are much more stringent in Norway, Sweden and Germany: houses \nmeeting their building codes use around one quarter of the energy of houses meeting \nthe required standards in England and Wales (Monbiot: 66).  \n \n \nPolicy issues \n \nBefore turning to governance, I adumbrate just three policy issues where climate change \nmitigation policies suggest implications \u2013 and some possible synergies - for social \npolicies. First, the move towards individual (as well as national) carbon budgets holds \nout potentially radical consequences for the theory and practice of redistribution and \nequity, as mentioned above. Strong social policies may well be necessary to address \nemerging inequalities and conflict. The \u2018Weitzman paradox\u2019 is relevant here (Weitzman \n1977). This demonstrates that the price mechanism works less well in more unequal \nsocieties, because prices that discourage carbon consumption by poorer groups will be \ninadequate to restrain the affluent. Thus income redistribution, a concern of traditional \nsocial policy, could facilitate the use of carbon pricing. In the absence of policies to \nimprove social justice the pursuit of environmental justice will require more directly \ninterventionist policies such as rationing. \n \nA second area of synergy concerns housing, transport, urban policies and community \ndevelopment \u2013 areas of social policy relatively neglected by JESP in the past. Heating \nresidential homes, and associated residential travel, are major sources of carbon \nemissions in Europe (though far below the USA). The IPCC Report (2007: 389) shows \n 7 \nthat baseline carbon emissions could be reduced in the residential sector by 29% at \neffectively no cost \u2013 the highest scope for reductions in any sector. Countries with very \ninefficient houses, such as the UK, could achieve a win-win outcome by improving \nquality and reducing emissions, if the political will was there. Given the high efficiency of \nhousing in some other European countries, there is great scope for policy learning and \ntransfer within the EU. Moreover, innovative housing and urban settlements provide \ngreat scope for the strategy of \u2018ecological modenisation\u2019 mentioned by Dryzek.  \n \nClimate change mitigation policies will require substantial and rapid shifts in consumer \nand producer behaviour, and this promises a third significant area of interaction with \nsocial policy. Four basic means are available to governments and other policy makers to \nshift behaviour: education and persuasion; taxation, subsidies and other monetary \nincentives; regulation (including rationing); and environmental engineering. Some \nnational and EU health policies, such as discouraging smoking, utilize all four. But there \nis critical experience in social policy of their limits. Incentives that appeal solely to self-\ninterest may fail when they degrade intrinsic motivations such as altruism and solidarity \n(Jones and Cullis 2000; Bowles 2007). Others recognize the limits of top-down \napproaches and stress the need to engage people and communities in changing \nbehaviour. These are lessons also stressed by campaigners for climate change policies: \nJackson (2005) for example argues that co-production of policies will be necessary if \nfundamental shifts to a low emission economy are to be achieved. There is scope for \nmutual policy learning here. \n \n \nGovernance: welfare state and eco-state \n \nOne might expect that a new unprecedented set of risks will generate new modes of \ngovernance, and that is what is happening at national, regional and global levels. After \nseveral decades of increasing resort to market solutions and the progressive \nmarginalisation of the role of governments, the climate change debate brings back \ncentre stage the role of public governance. This in two senses: a recognition of the \ncontributions to be made by a wide range of actors: government at all levels, the private \nsector, non-governmental actors and civil society (eg IPCC 2007: 82). And a recognition \nthat only governments can harness these different components into an effective strategy \nin a short time.  \n \nMeadowcroft and Dryzek both address these issues. Meadowcroft charts the emergence \nof environmental governance in the OECD world since the 1960s and identifies five \nmajor shifts. Both agree that we can now speak of the emergence of an environmental \nstate or eco-state. But both contend that this is much more weakly embedded \ninstitutionally than the welfare state: Dryzek writes \u2018we have gazed with envy upon social \npolicy, wondering how environmental concerns might ever come to be taken anywhere \nnear as seriously by governments as social policy concerns\u2019.  \n \nArriving much later, the eco-state is \u2018laired on top of\u2019 different economic systems (\u2018forms \nof capitalism\u2019), political systems and welfare state regimes (Meadowcroft). One finding \nhere is that social democratic welfare states have been pioneers in developing \ncomprehensive environmental policies, including climate change mitigation. Using \nScruggs\u2019 cross-national database Dryzek concludes: \u2018Social democratic welfare states \nand what Hall and Soskice call coordinated market economies (the two categories \noverlap substantially) are better placed to handle the intersection of social policy and \n 8 \nclimate change than the more liberal market economies with more rudimentary welfare \nstates\u2019. Similarly, in their research on public support for environmental priorities, \nGerhards and Lengfeld conclude: \u2018Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands, i.e. countries, \nwhich have developed strong welfare states, have at the same time the highest approval \nrating for environmental protection\u2019. \n \nOne reason for this, according to Dryzek, is the discourse of \u2018ecological modernisation\u2019: \na strategy that recognises that climate change can be good for business but which \nrequires the governance capacities of coordinated political economies. There are \nimportant parallels here with the earlier emergence of productive social policies in \nSweden and other Nordic countries in the 1930s. This policy synergy also builds on the \ngreater salience of equity issues in these North European countries. The IPCC Reports \nand the Stern Report illustrate that the threat of global climate change almost inevitably \nraises in stark forms questions of equity and sustainable development (IPCC 2007, chs \n2.6, 12). North European welfare states are therefore best prepared to engage with \nthese issues because of their more developed welfare systems. The contemporary result \nis the mainstreaming of both environmental and equality concerns across all areas of \ngovernment in Northern Europe. \n \nHowever, this rosy picture of synergy may be changing, argues Dryzek. The novelty and \nscale of climate change risks is driving a new governance agenda. Climate change \npolicies might displace social policy, providing a new focus of countervailing governance \nin the 21st century. There is a possibility that environmental justice may capture the \npolitical imagination weakening the traditional concerns of social justice.  \n \nBecause climate change is an intrinsically global issue, all these pressures and issues \nare multiplied at supra-national levels of governance. This alone would raise the profile \nof EU policies and institutions. But what was perhaps unexpected has been the \npioneering role of the EU in this area. As Gerhards and Lengfeld note, the EU\u2019s record of \ninnovations is extensive, from steering the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 through the first major \nEmissions Trading System (ETS) launched in 2005 to the decision in 2007 to set binding \nemission targets for EU member states. This was enabled, they argue, by the EU \nstrategy of \u2018frame-bridging\u2019, a specific form of governance spillover. This enhanced role \nfor European-level action further builds European governance capacity and may reshape \nthe debate on European action in the social domain. Indeed, might one argue that the \nEU remit on environmental action already exceeds its still marginal social dimension? \n \nFinally, in the longer term carbon budgeting will likely lead to a questioning of economic \ngrowth as a meta-goal of public policy. In the past growth has been broadly perceived as \na win-win means to accomplish other goals \u2013 now it may directly threaten them. This has \nmany parallels with new thinking in social policy about non-monetary concepts of \npoverty, capabilities, qualitative indicators of quality of life, concepts of social inclusion \nand exclusion and human wellbeing. This more radical social agenda has never \ndisplaced the primacy of growth in European policy-making and governance; maybe the \nthreat of climate change will force the issue.  \n \n 9 \nReferences  \n \nAnderson, J., Bowyer, C., Fergusson, M. and Valsecchi, C.
