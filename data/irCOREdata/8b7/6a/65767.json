The (im)morality of urban squatting after the Land \nRegistration Act 2002 \n \n(1) Introduction \n \nThe legal concept of \u2018squatting\u2019 refers to the unauthorised occupation of land \nbelonging to another.  In the words of Lord Denning: \u2018\u2026a squatter\u2026is one who, \nwithout colour of right, enters on an unoccupied house or land, intending to stay there \nas long as he can.\u20191  In social and political discourse in this country, however, the \nterm tends to be associated specifically with the deliberate occupation of empty \nresidential buildings in metropolitan areas - often colloquially described as \u2018urban \nsquatting\u2019.  At various points in history, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s, \nurban squatting has been regarded as a serious social problem.  Nevertheless, and \ndespite the popular perception of urban squatting as a criminal activity, often \ncriticised as being tantamount to \u2018land theft\u2019, squatting, per se, is not a criminal \noffence.2  Rather, the urban squatter, like other types of squatter, is regulated \npredominately through the civil law: for example, when landowners seek to utilise the \nlaw to remove squatters, they must pursue their action through the civil court by \nissuing a claim for the recovery of land.3  Most landowners who bring such an action \nare assured of legal protection so long as they can show good title to the land.  Even \nstill, the very fact that squatters may \u2018get away with\u2019 occupying property without \n                                                 \n1 McPhail v Persons Unknown [1973] Ch 447, 456B. \n2 In limited circumstances, squatting is indirectly criminalised through the Criminal Justice and Public \nOrder Act 1994.   \n3 Under Part 55 of the Civil Procedure Rules. \n 2\nhaving to pay, as well as the possibility that an owner could lose his or her title to an \nurban squatter, have tended to provoke moral indignation amongst the public at \nlarge.4   \n \n                                                \n \nProperty lawyers, on the other hand, have traditionally emphasised the justifications \nfor adverse possession, based on (a different set of) moral precepts,5 as well as on the \npremise of economic efficiency.6  In recent years, however, both the doctrine of\n \ns \n000), \n4 The press - from broadsheet to tabloid, and from news-websites to \u2018topical chat shows\u2019 - often report \non stories involving squatting: see, for example, O Koster, \u2018Farmer takes revenge on squatter\u2026with a \nforklift\u2019, The Daily Mail, 1 September 2006, in which a farmer lifted a car, and then a caravan in which \nthe squatter was sleeping with a fork-lift truck and moved them off his land; fifty-one \u2018blog\u2019 responses \nto this story were unanimously approving of the farmer\u2019s actions.; J Coles, \u2018Sun man evicts squat pair\u2019, \nThe Sun, 23 July 2004; P Simms, \u2018Family Homeless after Polish builders turn squatters\u2019, The Daily \nMail 9 June 2006; C Hartley, \u2018Squatters wreck mansion\u2019, The Sun, 1 September 2006; T Kelly, \u2018Raver\nseize \u00a310 million house\u2019, The Daily Mail 31 August 2006. Other news stories portraying squatters in a \nnegative light have focused specifically on adverse possession.  These include D Smith, \u2018Squatters to \nkeep \u00a31 million house\u2019, The Guardian, 5 April 2004; \u2018Squatter's tidy profit\u2019, (Tuesday, 25 April, 2\nhttp:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/uk\/725913.stm; C Gysin, \u2018Squatter becomes owner of \u00a3100,000 flat\u2019, The \nverse possession in th English context, see, for example, R \nDaily Mail, 15 June 2001; C Dyer \u2018Britain\u2019s biggest ever land-grab\u2019, The Guardian, 9 July 2002; \n\u2018Squatters handed \u00a39 million five-story Hampstead home\u2019, The Daily Mail, 28 September 2006.  \n5 For a discussion of the morality of ad\nAuchmuty, \u2018Not just a Good Children\u2019s Story: A Tribute to Adverse Possession\u2019 [2004] 68 \nConveyancer and Property Lawyer 293. \n6 See, for example, TW Merrill, Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Adverse Possession (1984) 79 \nNorthwestern University Law Review 1122; JM Netter, PL Hirsch & WD Manson, \u2018An Economic \nAnalysis of Adverse Possession Statutes\u2019 (1986) 6 International Review of Law and Economics 217; \nDK Irving, \u2018Should the Law Recognise the Acquisition of Title by Adverse Possession?\u2019 (1994)2 \nAustralian Property Law Journal 1; TJ Miceli & CF Sirmans, \u2018An Economic Theory of Adverse \n 3\nadverse possession in England and Wales, and, seemingly, the attitudes of many \nproperty lawyers towards the justifiability of both squatting and adverse possession \nhave been radically transformed.  A key turning point in the erosion of adverse \npossession was a joint report, published by the Law Commission and the Land \nRegistry in 1998, which set out extensive proposals for the reform of registered land, \nlargely intended to prepare the way for the implementation of e-conveyancing.7  In \naddition, the Law Commission set out an argument for the near-abolition of adverse \npossession in the context of registered land,8 which was subsequently realised through \nthe enactment of the Land Registration Act 2002 (hereafter \u2018LRA 2002\u2019).  While the \ntraditional principles for the acquisition of title through adverse possession enabled \nthe urban squatter to acquire rights in land \u2018automatically\u2019 after twelve years, under \nthe LRA 2002, an urban squatter seeking to defend their possession of land through \nthe acquisition of title must now apply to the Land Registry,9 which will serve a \n                                                                                                                                            \nPossession\u2019 (1995)15 International Review of Law and Economics 161; M Baker, T Miceli, CF \n1986) 64 \n launched in October 2007; see generally, http:\/\/www.landregistry.gov.uk\/e-\n. \nSirmans & GK Turnbull, Property Rights by Squatting: Land Ownership Risk and Adverse Possession \nStatutes (2001)77 Land Economics 360; LA Fennell, \u2018Efficient Trespass: The Case for \u2018Bad Faith\u2019 \nAdverse Possession\u2019 (2006) 100 Northwestern University Law Review 1037; JE Stake, \u2018The uneasy \ncase for adverse possession\u2019 (2001) 89 Georgetown Law Journal 2419; R Ellickson, \u2018Adverse \npossession and perpetuities law: two dents in the libertarian model of property rights\u2019 (1986) 64 Wash \nU LQ 723; RA Epstein, \u2018Past and future: the temporal dimension in the law of property\u2019 (\nWash U LQ 667-722; M Dockray: \u2018Why do we need adverse possession?\u2019 [1985] Conv 272. \n7 Law Commission & HM Land Registry, Land Registration for the Twenty-First Century: A \nConsultative Document (Law Com No 254), (London: HMSO, 1998).

Crucially, this \nprocedure provides the land owner with an opportunity to recover possession of the \nproperty before the squatter\u2019s occupation has given rise to any claim on the title to the \nnd.    \n                                                \nla\n \nThese reforms are striking, not least because the doctrine of adverse possession by \nlimitation of actions had long been regarded as a relatively stable and, for many, \njustifiable feature of the property law system.  Without a doubt, this dramatic \ndeparture was primarily motivated by the demands of title registration, since \nacquisition of title through adverse possession was seen to undermine the security of \nthe Land Register as the ultimate source of information about land ownership.  \nHowever, this article seeks to challenge the hegemony of land registration objectives \nwithin the Commission\u2019s analysis.  Indeed, the Commission itself had previously \nstated that: \u2018\u2026any substantive reform of [adverse possession] should be undertaken \nseparately and ought not to be conditioned purely by registered conveyancing \nconsiderations.\u201912  Nevertheless, in 2001, after conducting a process of consultation \n(to which a slight majority (60%) of those who responded supported the proposed \n \n entitlement to be registered as proprietor by some \ne matter \nand Registration (Law Com No 158, 1987), para 2.36. \n10 LRA 2002, Sch 6, para 2. \n11 LRA 2002, Sch 6, para 3.  Registration will only proceed, notwithstanding objection, if the squatter \ncan establish an estoppel in his or her favour, an\nother reason \u2013 for example, under a will or intestacy, or by virtue of an estate contract, or if th\nis a boundary dispute; LRA 2002, Sch 6, para 5.   \n12 Law Commission, Third Report on L\n 5\nreforms \u2018in principle\u201913) and with an acknowledgement of disquiet concerning the \nstate of the existing law amongst the media,14 the Law Commission enthusiastically \nthrew its weight behind what has since been described as the: \u2018\u2026emasculation of \ndverse possession in relation to registered land.\u201915   \n                                                \na\n \nThe Law Commission\u2019s ultimate objective was to prevent adverse occupiers from \nsuccessfully securing title where landowners had failed to engage in adequate \nsupervision of their properties.  The dangers of the old law for landowners had been \nhighlighted by a series of high profile media reports, where squatters acquired the title \nto extremely valuable properties after landowners failed to evict them before the \nlimitation period had expired.16  Of course, deliberate adverse possession is not \nsimply the preserve of the \u2018urban squatter\u2019.  However, the Commission appeared to be \nheavily influenced by media criticisms of cases involving local government, \nparticularly some London borough councils, in which title to valuable housing had \nbeen lost to urban squatters.17  As one commentator has noted: \u2018[t]he popular press \nhas seized on recent cases involving local authorities where \u2018undeserving\u2019 squatters \n \non adverse possession presently operates.\u2019; ibid. \ns for adverse \nsulting from a successful claim has fallen on the public purse.\u2019; above, n13, para 14.4.  \n13 Law Commission, Land Registration for the Twenty-First Century: A Conveyancing Revolution \n(Law Com No 271, 2001), para 14.4.  \n14 \u2018If the reports in the press are any kind of barometer, there would appear to be considerable public \ndisquiet with the way that the law \n15 M Dixon, \u2018The reform of property law and the Land Registration Act 2002: A risk assessment\u2019 \n(2003) 67 Conv 136 at 150. \n16 Squatters in forgotten properties have made a number of high-profile successful claim\npossession in recent years: see, for example, C Dyer \u2018Britain\u2019s biggest ever land-grab\u2019, The Guardian, \n9 July 2002; D Smith, \u2018Squatters to keep \u00a31 million house\u2019, The Guardian, 5 April 2004.  \n17 The Law Commission specifically referred to cases involving: \u2018\u2026land owned by local authorities, so \nthat the loss re\n 6\nobtained title through long possession, as an example of the law being an ass.\u201918  \nAgainst the intensity of the opprobrium levelled against urban squatters in the media, \nthe combined effect of relativity of title and the principle of limitation of actions, \nwhich gave rise to an apparent preference for the claims of squatters, over and above \nnterests of landowners,had become an awkward position to defend.  \nnds a more thorough critical analysis.  Following Dixon\u2019s \nsugges\ngistered land\u2026It is a matter of perception, not \nthe i\n      \nSo far as the legal academy is concerned, the effective abolition of the doctrine of \nadverse possession has attracted surprisingly little critical attention.  Martin Dixon, \nfor example, has described himself as being: \u2018(possibly in a minority of one) [in that \nhe] regards the reform of the process of adverse possession by the 2002 Act as an \nunnecessary and economically unjustified \u2018bolt on\u2019 to the reform of registered land.\u201919  \nOn the whole, these reforms have been presented by the Law Commission, and \naccepted by property lawyers, as being wholly justified in the context of a modern \nsystem of \u2018title by registration\u2019, such as that envisaged by the architects of the LRA \n2002.  It is our contention, however, that the effective abolition of adverse possession \nin registered land dema\ntion that, in fact:  \n\u2018\u2026there is nothing inherently contradictory in having principles of adverse \npossession operate in re\nincontrovertible logic.\u2019;20 \n                                                 \n18 O Rhys, \u2018Adverse Possession, Human Rights and Judicial Heresy\u2019 [2002] Conveyancer and Property \nLawyer 470. \n19 M Dixon, \u2018Adverse Possession and Human Rights\u2019 [2005] Conveyancer and Property Lawyer 345 at \n351.  See also M Dixon, \u2018Adverse possession in three jurisdictions\u2019 [2006] Conveyancer and Property \nLawyer 179 for further criticism of the reforms set out in the LRA 2002. \n20 M Dixon, above n15, p151-2. \n 7\nwe suggest that, notwithstanding the apparent elegance of these reforms, the approval \nthey have undoubtedly garnered, and the relative lack of scholarly criticism levelled \ngainst them, the reforms to adverse possession set out in the LRA 2002 require a \neconomic arguments that relate to each of these categories.  The application of the \n                                                \na\nmore robust justification than the Law Commission has provided.   \n \nThe Commission\u2019s analysis of the law of adverse possession should have provided the \nperfect opportunity to analyse in depth the vast body of theory evaluating both the \nefficiency and morality of the doctrine.  On the one hand, it might have led to a \nconsideration of the many theoretical economic justifications (beyond the simple \nmatter of certainty of title) that have been put forward by various commentators in \nrecent years.21  On the other hand, it might also have allowed the Commission to \nengage with the broad range of philosophical arguments that have traditionally been \nthought to justify the acquisition of title through adverse possession on moral \ngrounds, including desert-labour theory, personhood and moral utilitarianism.22  \nHowever, the Commission failed to carry out anything like an adequate assessment of \nthe vast body of literature on this subject, resorting instead to a \u201ccommon sense\u201d \napproach to the issue that revolved around the key importance of the Land Register in \nensuring certainty of title in a system of registered land and the ethical distinction that \nwas drawn between \u2018good faith\u2019 and \u2018bad faith\u2019 squatters.  To illustrate the limits of \nthe Law Commission\u2019s economic and moral analysis this article argues that the Law \nCommission has (unhelpfully) essentialised the problem of squatting.  It has failed to \nconsider fully the wide variety of types of squatter and the varying types of moral and \n \n21 See above, n6. \n22 See, below, section 4. \n 8\nLRA 2002 reforms to the particular paradigm of the urban squatter provides a useful \nlens through which to view the limitations of the Commission\u2019s analysis of the \nroblem.  \n \n(2) The doctrine of adverse possession\np\n \n                                                \n \nBefore the enactment of the LRA 2002, the doctrine of adverse possession, based on \nthe principle of limitation, gave rise to similar results in registered and unregistered \nland.  In unregistered land, twelve years\u2019 adverse possession led to the extinguishment \nof the paper owner\u2019s title, and the squatter\u2019s common law estate grew out of his \npossession of the land.  So too, on a successful application from a squatter in \nregistered land, the registered proprietor\u2019s title was closed, and a new title opened for \nthe squatter: although registration was necessary to complete the squatter\u2019s legal title, \nthe squatter acquired beneficial ownership of the property automatically, under a \nstatutory trust.   Furthermore, the doctrine was, at least in relation to unregistered \nland, traditionally regarded as striking a reasonable balance between, on the one hand, \nthe rights of the landowner - whose claim, after 12 years, was regarded as \u2018stale\u2019, and \nthe squatter \u2013 whose long possession of the property was recognised on grounds of \nboth morality and economic and transactional efficiency.23  The importance of \nsettling claims to land ownership, as well as the perceived investment, both emotional \nand economic, made by the squatter in the property during the limitation period, were \n \n23 See above, nn5-6.  In a recent issue of this journal, Brice Dickson, discussing the decision of Pye v \nUK in the European Court of Human Rights, noted that: \u2018\u2026judges in England have always accepted \nthat the English law on adverse possession strikes a fair balance between the rights of squatters, on the \none hand, and the rights of dispossessed landowners, on the other.\u2019; B Dickson, \u2018Britain\u2019s Law Lords \nand Human Rights\u2019 [2006]26 Legal Studies 329 at 340.    \n 9\nseen to justify the acquisition of ownership rights by the squatter after the designated \ntime period had expired.  While this perspective has continued to prevail in many \ncommon law jurisdictions \u2013 even those which have developed mature systems of title \nregistration24 - there has, in recent years, been a major shift in property law discourse \nin England and Wales, which has emphasised the apparent incongruity of a doctrine \nof adverse possession within a system of registered land.  This outlook has been \nattributed to the increasingly centralised focus of English land law on the bureaucratic \nefficiency of registered titles.  In the most recent edition of Elements of Land Law, \nGray & Gray wrote that: \u2018\u2026it has come to seem increasingly strange that adverse \npossession should have any relevance in a regime where the formal registration of \ntle is supposed to provide a definitive record of estate ownership.\u201925   \nthe focus of the law\u2019s attention to the information on the register, rather than the \n                                                \nti\n \nThe principal objective of a land registration system is to render the register more \ndefinitive as to title.  The LRA 2002 has made significant progress towards this goal \nby transforming the fundamental basis of entitlement to land in English law, from \npossession of land as a good root of title, to registration as the source of title.  As the \nLRA 2002 has demonstrated, the consequences of moving towards a mature system of \ntitle registration include the bureaucratisation of land ownership, as well as a shift in \n \n24 For example, in Australia, where the Torrens system of title registration originated, it is notable that: \n\u2018[e]xcepting the Northern Territory and ACT, which prohibit the acquisition of title to registered land \nby adverse possession, all Australasian jurisdictions permit an occupier to acquire a possessory title \ncapable of registration and, upon registration, gain the advantages of the paramountcy and conclusive \nevidence provisions of the relevant registered land title statutes.\u2019; M Park, L Ting, I Williamson, \n\u2018Adverse Possession of Torrens Land\u2019 (1998)72 Law Institute Journal 77. \n25 KJ Gray & SF Gray, Elements of Land Law (4th Edn, Oxford: OUP, 2005), p377. \n 10\nsituation \u2018on the ground\u2019.26  In light of the policy agenda that informed the LRA 2002, \nit was perhaps unsurprising for the Law Commission to propose that the traditional \noperation of adverse possession was unsatisfactory when applied to registered land.27  \nIn fact, the Law Commission went even further, when it adopted the view that the \nprinciple of limitation in respect of land could not justifiably be retained within a \nsystem of title registration.28  The Law Commission\u2019s primary concern regarding \nadverse possession was that: \u2018\u2026the doctrine\u2026runs counter to the fundamental \nconcept of indefeasibility of title that is a feature of registered title.\u201929  It continued \nthat: \u2018[i]f a system of registered title is to be effective, those who registered their titles \nshould be able to rely upon the fact of registration to protect their ownership except \nwhere there are compelling reasons to the contrary.\u201930  The Law Commission \ntherefore sought to prevent squatters from acquiring title to land by adverse \npossession, except in certain specific and limited circumstances, where: \u2018\u2026it was \nnecessary either in the interests of fairness or to ensure that land remained saleable\u2019.31   \n \n                                                 \n26 Gray & Gray have described: \u2018\u2026the ultimate achievement of the Land Registration Act 2002 [as] its \nruthless maximisation of rational legal order, an aim which is symbolised by the statutory vision of an \nelectronic register of virtually indefeasible titles, transactable by automated dealings and guaranteed by \nthe state.  Under this tightly organised regime, estate ownership, as constituted by the register record, \nbecomes a heavily protected phenomenon, leaving little room for the operation \u201coff the record\u201d of \nsome ancient and pragmatic principle of long possession.\u2019; ibid, p364.   \n27 Law Com No 254, above n7.  See also Law Com No 271, above n13.  \n28 Law Com No 254, above n7, para 10.2. \n29 Law Com No 271, above n13, para 14.3. \n30 Law Com No 254, above n7, para 10.11. \n31 Ibid, para 10.2. \n 11\nWhen considering the way in which the Law Commission chose to strike the balance \nbetween the landowner and different types of claimant for adverse possession, it is \nimportant to bear in mind the powerful influence of policy in the analysis that \npreceded the LRA 2002.  The Law Commission, in seeking to identify the \n\u2018compelling reasons\u2019 that had historically supported the doctrine of adverse \npossession, set out four \u2018traditional justifications\u2019 for the doctrine.  These \njustifications \u2013 as catalogued by the Law Commission - each reflected one of the twin \ngoals of fairness and saleability.32  They were: (1) to protect against stale claims and \navoid landowners from sleeping on their rights; (2) to keep land marketable, ensuring \nthat where, for example, the landowner has disappeared and cannot be traced the land \n\u2018remains in commerce and is not rendered sterile\u2019;33 (3) to prevent hardship in cases \nof mistake; and (4) to facilitate conveyancing.  Ultimately, however, the Commission \nanswered each of these justifications as inappropriate in the context of registered land.  \nIt is of course doubtless the case that the traditional justifications on \u2018saleability\u2019, set \nout in (2) and (4), were met by the Law Commission\u2019s counter-argument, that: \n\u2018[w]here title is registered, adverse possession facilitates deduction of title only in \nrelation to those matters on which the register is not conclusive.\u201934  Much more \ncontentious, however, was the Commission\u2019s approach to the concept of fairness. \n \nThe first component of the Commission\u2019s argument sought to highlight the \n\u2018undeserving\u2019 nature of many claims for title through adverse possession.  It accepted \n                                                 \n32 Ibid, paras 10.6-10.9. \n33 Ibid, para 10.13. \n34 Ibid, para 10.10.  It is, however, suggested below that the Law Commission failed to consider the full  \nimplications of its proposals for the saleability of property; see below, section 5. \n 12\nthe importance of protecting certain categories of \u2018inadvertent\u2019 squatter from \nhardship, for example, those operating under a reasonable mistake as to boundaries, as \nnoted in justification (3), above, on the basis that: \u2018[i]n these cases we think the \nsquatter, whose conduct has been perfectly reasonable, should prevail over the \nregistered proprietor\u2019.35  In contrast to this, however, the Commission was highly \ncritical of those squatters who deliberately take possession of land, and reasoned that: \n\u2018[i]t is, of course, remarkable that the law is prepared to legitimise such \u2018possession of \nwrong\u2019 which, at least in some cases, is tantamount to sanctioning a theft of land.\u201936  \nThe law of theft in the United Kingdom requires the dishonest appropriation of \nproperty belonging to another with the intention to permanently to deprive another of \nit.37  To be guilty of theft, the individual defendant must know that the property \nbelongs to another, and the \u2018land theft\u2019 approach to adverse possession extends this \nanalysis to the knowingly unauthorised use of land.  The idea that law would \nlegitimate this \u2018land theft\u2019 through a transfer of title was described as \u2018distasteful\u2019.38  \nSignificantly, by focusing upon the construction of advertent squatting as \u2018land theft\u2019, \nthe Law Commission has introduced, for the first time in England and Wales, an \nimportant moral distinction between what it terms good and bad faith adverse \npossession.39  The basis of moral opprobrium, quite simply, is the squatter\u2019s own \n                                                 \n35 Law Com No 271, above n13, para 14.7. \n36 Ibid, para 10.5 \n37 The requirement of an intention to permanently deprive also imports the assumption that an urban \nsquatter, squats for title rather than merely enjoying the use of the land for the time being. \n38 Law Com No 271, above n13, para 10.13. \n39 The decision of the Court of Appeal in Prudential Assurance Co ltd v Waterloo Real Estate Inc \n([1999]2 EGLR 85 at 87) re-affirmed the irrelevance of the distinction between innocent and wilful \ntrespass for the purposes of animus possidendi in English law.  However, this distinction is a major \n 13\nknowledge of his or her occupation, which - like mens rea under the criminal law - \nrenders the otherwise innocent act a culpable one.   \n \nThe second, and arguably more implicit, component of the Commission\u2019s moral \nanalysis was an emphasis upon the blamelessness of the dispossessed landowner.  On \nthe one hand, the Commission identified certain landowners as blameworthy, for \nexample, a landowner who encouraged an inadvertent squatter to rely on his \nrepresentations (reasoning rooted, of course, in the ethos of proprietary estoppel) and \nproposed an exception to deal with this scenario.  More importantly though, noting in \nparticular the argument in justification (1), above, that the principle of limitation is \nintended to bar claimants from \u2018sleeping on their rights\u2019, the Commission pointed out \nthat landowners who lose title to deliberate squatters are often unaware of the \npresence of squatters on their property until it is too late.  In these circumstances \u2013 \ndeliberate squatting unnoticed as a result of the inadvertence of the landowner - the \nCommission considered it unfair to allow a squatter to gain title to the property.  \nIndeed, this concern with the problem of effective supervision was central to the Law \nCommission\u2019s rationale for the curtailment of adverse possession in registered land.40 \n  \n                                                                                                                                            \ntheme in academic commentary and judicial reasoning in the United States: see, for example, R H \nHelmholz, \u2018Adverse possession and subjective intent\u2019 (1983) 61 Washington University Law Quarterly \n331; and underpins the law in many civil law jurisdictions. \n40 This policy approach was also reinforced in the decision of the House of Lords in J A Pye (Oxford) \nLtd v Graham [2003] 1 AC 419 when Lord Hope commented that \u2018[t]he unfairness of the old regime \nwhich this case has demonstrated lies not in the absence of compensation, although that is an important \nfactor, but in the lack of safeguards against oversight or inadvertence on the part of the registered \nproprietor\u2019; ibid, at 447 per Lord Hope. \n 14\nThe Law Commission alluded to two circumstances in which a landowner might not \nrealise that deliberate squatting is taking place on his property.  On the one hand, the \nlandowner may be unaware of the presence of a squatter since squatting: \u2018\u2026can take \nplace without it being readily detectable.\u201941  Deliberate squatters wishing to remain \nundisturbed often \u2018make concerted efforts to remain invisible to avoid eviction\u2019.42  \nThis also ran counter to one of the overarching aims of the Law Commission\u2019s reform \nproposals, which sought to minimise the circumstances in which \u2018undiscoverable\u2019 \ninterests would be binding on a purchaser of land.43  The second, and arguably more \nimportant issue identified by the Law Commission was the problem of \u2018forgotten \nproperties\u2019.  Properties may become \u2018forgotten\u2019 whenever a landowner fails to \nmaintain effective scrutiny over the land and consequently does not realise that \n                                                 \n41 Law Com No 254, above n7, para 10.6. \n42 K Reeve and S Coward, Hidden Homelessness, Life on the Margins: The Experiences of Homeless \nPeople living in Squats (Crisis\/Countryside Agency: London, 2004), p4. \n43 Law Com No 254, above n7, para 4.13.  The LRA 2002 also removed freestanding overriding status \nfrom the rights of adverse possessors who had acquired equitable title before 13 October 2003, but who \nhave not yet registered to complete their legal title.  These equitable interests are now only overriding if \nthe adverse possessor is in actual occupation of the land, thus bringing their claim under the umbrella \nof Schedule 3, para 2.  Dixon has noted that this position: \u2018...further protects a purchaser from \nundiscoverable and unregistered rights; and it confirms the idea that in an effective registration system \npossession alone should not generate title.  It also supports \u2013 probably unintentionally \u2013 one of the \njustifications for adverse possession by disapplying the claim of anyone who is not utilising the land \neconomically or socially.\u2019; Dixon (2003), above n15, p144.  Furthermore, the interests of persons in \nactual occupation are, under paragraph 2, now only overriding if they would have been \u2018obvious on a \nreasonably careful inspection of the land\u2019; para 2(c)(i).  Similarly, in relation to those legal easements \nwhich are now overriding, the idea that the easements were \u2018obvious on a reasonably careful inspection \nof the land\u2019 is also added through para 3(1)(b). \n 15\nsquatting is taking place there.44  Failure to keep property under scrutiny can mean \nthat squatters are able to deliberately occupy premises unnoticed for considerable \nperiods.  Prior to the LRA 2002, this could also lead, ultimately, to the possibility of \nthe squatter mounting a successful claim for title by adverse possession.   \n \nFor the Law Commission, the problem of forgotten properties was one for which \nlandowners were regarded as blameless.  The proposals were intended to protect large \nlandowners who \u2018own numerous and perhaps widely scattered parcels of land for \nwhich they may have no present use, and which they cannot keep under regular \nscrutiny\u2019.45  The clear (and contentious) moral implication here \u2013 that landowners \ncannot rather than simply do not supervise their properties effectively \u2013 reinforces the \nview that they should not be punished for inadequate supervision by losing title to \ntheir land.  The LRA 2002 was specifically designed to protect registered proprietors \nfrom the possibility of such oversight or inadvertence.  Indeed, bearing in mind the \nLaw Commission\u2019s objectives in respect of avoiding \u2018land theft\u2019, these procedures are \napt and effective.  Since it is now impossible for a squatter to gain title to registered \nproperty without first notifying the landowner, the situation in which a landowner \nremains unaware of the presence of squatters until it is too late is entirely avoided.  \nYet, while this outcome clearly satisfies the Law Commission\u2019s agenda in relation to \ntransactional and economic efficiency, this article argues that the moral stance \nadopted by the Commission to bolster these reforms requires further exegesis.  The \nfollowing sections scrutinize the moral outlook adopted by the Law Commission by \n                                                 \n44 Of course, this can also happen on a much smaller scale, although inadvertently, when the squatter \nand the landowner are mistaken as to boundary lines. \n45 Law Com No 254, above n7, para 10.19. \n 16\nfocusing on the case of deliberate squatters who make their homes in unsupervised \nproperties. \n \n(3) The paradigm of the urban squatter in \u2018forgotten\u2019 properties \n \n(a) Who is the urban squatter? \n \nThe phenomenon of widespread urban squatting first became evident in the UK in the \nperiods following both the first and second world wars.  It was during the 1960s and \n1970s, however, that a major organised squatting movement developed, most notably \nin London.46  Although urban squatting no longer attracts the high-profile coverage \nthat it garnered during the 1960s and 1970s, this type of unlawful occupation appears \nto be increasing once again.  In 2005, an article in The Independent noted that:  \n\u2018The number of squatters in England and Wales has risen by 60 per cent since \n1995, according to the Advisory Service for Squatters (ASS), the best source of \nsuch estimates, from 9,500 people to around 15,000.  The voluntary group, \nwhich helps squatters fight their cases in court, says its phones have not been so \nbusy since the squatting peak of the late 1970s.\u201947 \nIn a consultation paper published during the 1970s, aimed at establishing the \ncharacteristics of the movement, the government concluded that:  \n                                                 \n46 A Friend, \u2018The post war squatters\u2019 in N Wates and C Wolmar (eds), Squatting: The Real Story \n(London: Bay Leaf Books, 1980); C Johnstone, \u2018Housing and class struggles in post-war Glasgow\u2019 in \nM Lavalette and G Mooney (eds) Class struggle and social welfare (London: Routledge, 2000).

Some, whether families or single \npeople, have a genuine need for housing\u2026Some have political objectives \u2013 \neither to influence central and local government housing policies, or to bring \nabout more far-reaching changes.  Others may prefer the life-style of squatting \nand its cheapness; or they may be existing council tenants trying to force the \ncouncil into giving them a transfer, or the children of tenants trying to obtain \ntheir tenancy.  Yet others may be disaffected groups or individuals who \nwelcome the freedom and anonymity of squatting, may be passing through or \ntourists.  The list could go on.\u201948  \nThis excerpt captures the variety of attitudes and circumstances of the urban squatter, \nacross political, social and economic spectra.49  As the Government implicitly \nrecognised in 1975, an essentialist model of \u2018the urban squatter\u2019 would fail to capture \nthe nuances of the heterogeneous collection of individuals who chose to engage in the \nactivity of deliberate squatting in empty residential property.     \n \nSo far as central government and the media are concerned, urban squatting has \ntypically been regarded as a serious social problem.50  It is not only successful cases \nof adverse possession that have attracted considerable public disapproval,51 but the \n                                                 \n48 Department of the Environment, Consultation Paper on Squatting (London: HMSO, 1975). \n49 See also A M Pritchard, \u2018Squatters \u2013 The Law and the Mythology\u2019 [1976] Conveyancer and \nProperty Lawyer 255. \n50 N Wates & C Wolmar, Squatting: The Real Story (London: Bay Leaf Books, 1980).  Some local \ngovernment bodies seem to have had a more ambivalent attitude: see, for example, the mass of \nsquatters that were able to occupy properties belonging to Lambeth council for many years, with the \ncouncil\u2019s knowledge, discussed further below. \n51 See above, n4 and associated text. \n 18\nmere presence of squatters - and their perceived proclivities as a social group - \narguably attracts as much opposition as the risk that squatters may pose to the \nproperty rights of landowners.  Modern representations of urban squatters tend to \nportray those who squat as part of a dangerous subculture.52  Media reports \nassociating squatters with a range of social problems, from drug dealing to arson, \ndereliction, vandalism, and litter, feed: \u2018[a] popular mythology\u2026that all squatters are \nparasitic deviants who steal people\u2019s houses and constitute a threat to everything \ndecent in society.\u201953  The political response to urban squatting has also been \nparticularly unsympathetic.  In 1991, the Home Office declared that:  \n\u2018There are no valid arguments in defence of squatting.  It represents the seizure \nof another\u2019s property without consent\u2026The Government does not accept the \nclaim that is sometimes made that squatting is a reasonable recourse of the \nhomeless resulting from social deprivation.  Squatters are generally there by \ntheir own choice, moved by no more than self gratification or an unreadiness to \nrespect other people\u2019s rights.\u201954 \nIn fact, this attitude is also reflected in legal responses to the phenomenon of urban \nsquatting.  Successive governments have sought to provide more effective support for \nthose affected by this particular form of squatting through legislative initiatives.55  For \nexample, sections 72 to 76 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 \n                                                 \n52 For a recent example of the media\u2019s portrayal of urban squatters, see V Dodd, \u2018The party\u2019s over for \nsquatters in \u00a314 million house\u2019, The Guardian, September 1 2006. \n53 Wates & Wolmar, above n50, p3. \n54 Home Office, Squatting: a Home Office consultation paper (London: HMSO, 1991), paras 5 and 62. \n55 Home Office, ibid; see also Lord Chancellor\u2019s Department, New procedures to combat squatting in \nhouses, shops and other buildings: a consultation paper on proposals for rule changes (London: \nHMSO, 1994).  \n 19\nenhanced police powers under the Criminal Law Act 1977 by criminalising squatters \nwho displace the occupiers of residential properties from their homes.  Similarly, in \nthe context of property law, the courts have been accused of \u2018subverting\u2019 the \nLimitation Act 1980, as: \u2018\u2026judicial reluctance to assist squatters has manifested itself \nin a number of different ways.\u201956    \n \nThe 1991 Home Office portrait of the urban squatter emphasises characteristics of \nselfishness, irresponsibility and dangerousness.  Yet, by essentialising the urban \nsquatter in this way, contemporary political and social discourses have suppressed an \nalternative image of the urban squatter.  For left-wing commentators, and urban \nsquatters themselves, the indictment of \u2018land theft\u2019 may, in some cases, be countered \nby the defence of necessity, with squatting presented as a justifiable activity in light of \nstructural socio-economic injustices within the housing market.57  Indeed, the \napparent rise in urban squatting at the beginning of the 21st century can be viewed as a \nreaction to a new housing crisis.  Historically, large-scale urban squatting has been \nlinked to periods of acute shortage in affordable housing stock, particularly in the \nsouth-east, coupled with high proportions of empty properties.58  Certainly, the early \n                                                 \n56 Rhys, above n18, p471; one example of a judicial technique to defeat squatters was the doctrine of \n\u2018implied licence\u2019; see Leigh v Jack (1879) 5 Ex D 264 (CA); Wallis\u2019s Holiday Camp v Shell-Max \n[1975] 1 QB 94 (CA).  For a more recent illustration of judicial creativity in this vein see Beaulane \nProperties Limited v Palmer [2005] EWHC 817.  \n57 Of course, while used here as an analogy, the criminal defence of necessity has not worked to protect \nsquatters in practice.  In Southwark London Borough Council v Williams [1971] 1 Ch 734 the Court of \nAppeal famously held that necessity was no defence to trespass by homeless people squatting in empty \ncouncil houses during a severe housing shortage in London in the 1970s.   \n58 Reeve & Coward, above n42. \n 20\nyears of the twenty-first century have seen the return of the historical economic \npreconditions for urban squatting: many British cities are currently experiencing \nspirally housing costs, and this is coupled with a growing political concern with the \nhigh incidence of empty homes across the country.  Average house prices in Britain \nrose by almost 12% from 2003-2004, following a rise of 16% from 2002 to 2003.59  \nIn addition, statistics published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have \nindicated that 3.8 million new households will be in need of accommodation by \n2016;60 that there are currently around 78,000 families living in temporary \naccommodation in England and Wales;61 and that properties currently lying empty \ncould potentially offer around 600,000 new homes,62 almost one hundred thousand of \nthese in London alone, where the housing market is most saturated.63  The \ngovernment has identified the problem of \u2018empty homes\u2019 as a key political issue, and \nthe Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has released a series of papers aimed at \ntackling the problem by bringing these properties back into the system.64  These \nissues cast an interesting light on the relative moral blameworthiness of urban \n                                                 \n59 Social Trends 36, (London: Office for National Statistics, 2006), p158. \n60 Ibid; statistics from Housing Statistics: projections of Households in England 2021 (London: DETR, \n1999). \n61 Ibid; statistics from More than a Roof: A Report into Tackling Homelessness (London: ODPM, \n2002).  \n62 Ibid. \n63 Information provided by local authorities to DTLR on Housing Investment Programme returns: \nwww.emptyhomes.com. \n64 See, for example, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Empty Homes: Temporary Management, \nLasting Solutions (A Consultation Paper) (London: HMSO, May 2003); Office of the Deputy Prime \nMinister, Empty Property: Unlocking the Potential \u2013 A Case for Action (London: HMSO, February \n2003). \n 21\nsquatters, who occupy empty residential property as their homes, and landowners who \nfail to adequately supervise their land. \n                                                \n \n(b) Local authority properties as targets for urban squatting \n \nInterestingly, since the \u2018hey-day\u2019 of organised urban squatting in the 1960s and 1970s, \nthe movement has been predominately concentrated in local authority properties.  By \n1986, 74 per cent of all premises occupied by squatters (around 5,500 properties) \nwere owned either by local authorities or housing associations.65  In 1990, three \nLondon boroughs alone - Southwark, Lambeth and Hackney - owned 65 per cent of \nthe national total of squatted homes.66  It is interesting to note that, even at this time, \nwhen local councils managed almost a third of all dwellings in the country and were \nthe principal providers of rented housing,67 the number of empty properties controlled \nby councils accounted for a relatively small proportion of the total number of empty \nproperties, both in London and in the rest of the country.  In 1975, for instance, when \nsquatting in local authority properties was at its peak, there were 60,000 empty private \nproperties, and only 12,000 empty council homes in London \u2013 a 5:1 ratio.68  More \nrecent statistics showing the numbers of vacant dwellings in London and across \nEngland and Wales reflect an even greater disparity between the numbers of empty \nprivate properties and local authority properties: in London, in 2005, the proportion of \n \n65 Above, n54, para 9. \n66 Ibid, para 10. \n67 From a peak of 30 per cent of all housing in the UK local authorities now control just 11 per cent: see \nDepartment for Local Communities and the Environment statistics at \nhttp:\/\/www.communities.gov.uk\/pub\/7\/Table101_id1156007.xls. \n68 D Cant, Squatting and private property rights (London: UCL, 1978). \n 22\nempty private properties (74,811) when compared to empty council properties (9,619) \nshows a ratio of almost 8:1.69  Indeed, the preponderance of empty private properties \ncompared to empty local authority properties is even greater across England and \nWales as a whole, at a ratio of 12:1.70   \n \nIn an effort to explain the disproportionate presence of urban squatters in local \nauthority properties, it has been suggested that the practical benefits of targeting such \nproperties include the greater ease with which potential squatters can identify empty \nproperties in the public sector, and the fact that squatters were less likely to be \nsecretly and illegally evicted by force by a local authority.71  The tendency for urban \nsquatters to occupy empty local authority properties is also explicable (historically at \nleast) on ideological grounds, on the basis that the local authority has a duty to house \nthe homeless.  Perhaps most importantly, however, council housing may also appear \nan attractive prospect for urban squatters since local authorities are more likely to own \nlarge numbers of non-transactional properties, which are liable to become \u2018forgotten\u2019.  \nIndeed, this is clearly the type of property that historically has been most frequently \ntargeted by urban squatters.  As Pritchard noted in the 1970s, the most frequent victim \nof squatting was \u2018the local authority or other person or body that has acquired the \n                                                 \n69 Statistics are based on information provided by local authorities to DTLR on Housing Investment \nProgramme returns, see http:\/\/www.emptyhomes.com\/resources\/statistics\/statistics.htm#2004 \n70 Ibid.  In 2005 there were 585,539 private properties lying vacant, compared to 48,594 local authority \nproperties.  These statistics do not include properties owned by Registered Social Landlords or other \npublicly owned homes.  \n71 Cant, above n68.  \n 23\npremises for redevelopment, whether in the long term or as soon as acquisition of \nneighbouring sites and supply of finance will allow.\u201972  \n \nOf course, the problems associated with \u2018forgotten properties\u2019 are not confined to \nlocal authorities.  Following the transfer of large volumes of council housing stock to \nregistered social landlords under Large Scale Voluntary Transfers, these organisations \nare now vulnerable to similar risks, owing to the large volumes of stock they \nmanage.73  The problem of \u2018forgotten\u2019 properties is also potentially significant for the \nprivate sector.  Although there is no empirical research on contemporary squatting \npreferences, it is reasonable to expect that private property may be increasingly \ntargeted by squatters, as the decreasing stock of council properties since the 1970s,74 \ncombined with more efficient management practices in the public sector, have dulled \nthe squatting potential of local authority properties.75  On the other hand, from 1975 \nto 2005, the proportion of private sector to public sector empty homes has more than \ndoubled.76  Private bodies are also likely to own not only residential properties, but \nempty commercial buildings which could prove attractive to squatters.  Although it is \nperhaps less likely that property will be literally \u2018forgotten\u2019 by private owners, \nproperty purchased for speculation or future use may not be regularly monitored, for \n                                                 \n72 Pritchard, above n49. \n73 See for example the recent case of Family Housing Association v Donellan [2002] 1 P&CR 34, \nwhich highlighted the vulnerability of private sector landlords in relation to adverse possession. \n74 As a result of the right to buy legislation and Large-Scale Voluntary Transfers (\u2018LSVT\u2019) to registered \nsocial landlords.    \n75 This appears to be the practical conclusion reached by the authors of the latest edition of the \nSquatters Handbook: Advisory Service for Squatters, Squatters Handbook (12th ed, 2004), p10. \n76 See above, n68-70 and associated text. \n 24\nexample, if the owner lives abroad.  Such properties are now likely to be equally \nattractive to urban squatters seeking to identify an empty property which they can \noccupy, and in which they are likely to go undisturbed, for the time being at least.       \n \n(4) The \u2018immorality\u2019 of the urban squatter \n \nThe new regime for adverse possession in registered land, as set out by the Law \nCommission and implemented through the LRA, adopted a clear moral view on \n\u2018advertent squatters\u2019, as the prospect that the urban squatter could acquire the title to \nland automatically, on the expiry of the limitation period, was deemed to be \ninherently unfair.  There were two elements to this rationale: first, that unlike other \ntypes of inadvertent trespasser, urban squatters were identified as immoral because \nthey deliberately occupied property which they knew did not belong to them; and \nsecondly, that the landowner who failed to effectively supervise his property was to \nbe regarded as blameless, even though he or she had failed to identify and\/or remove \nsquatters who were occupying their property within the limitation period.  When \nconsidering the Law Commission\u2019s policy stance on squatting, Dixon has noted that: \n\u2018the point\u2026is not that the provisions of the LRA 2002 are flawed or misguided.  They \nreflect powerful arguments of policy and, while not everyone may agree with them, \nthose arguments cannot be dismissed lightly.\u201977  It is suggested, however, that the \nLaw Commission\u2019s moral stance on urban squatters played an important role in \nexcluding \u2013 and, for the future, avoiding - any further consideration of the ideological \narguments surrounding squatting and adverse possession.  The complex philosophical \nand jurisprudential issues at stake were reduced to two simple \u2018facts\u2019: (1) acquisition \n                                                 \n77 Dixon, above n15, p153.   \n 25\nof title through adverse possession is incompatible with title registration; and (2) \nsquatters act immorally by trespassing on other people\u2019s land.  The final step for the \nLaw Commission was to lightly dismiss the notion that squatting should be supported, \nor even tolerated, by law at all.     \n \nThis simplistic account of the competing interests at stake when balancing the \nsquatter\u2019s possession against the landowner\u2019s right to ownership prioritises \ntransactional efficiency, bolstered by the position that advertent squatters are morally \nblameworthy, while landowners are morally blameless.  This position can be \nchallenged on two grounds: for one thing, the Law Commission\u2019s moral stance on \nadvertent squatting was assumed without any explicit consideration of the vast body \nof philosophical and jurisprudential debate that has surrounded the morality of \nsquatting.  In addition to this, the narrow parameters of the Law Commission\u2019s \nanalysis failed to recognise that the phenomenon of squatting must be located within a \nbroader systemic framework, in relation to both the extrinsic factors that encourage \nurban squatting \u2013 for example, rising house prices, inadequate supply of affordable \nhousing, and a high volume of empty properties - and the systemic consequences of \nboth squatting itself, and the legal regulation of property rights through adverse \npossession, for the housing market.  The Law Commission\u2019s moral essentialism \nforeclosed any consideration of these important issues.   \n \nThe Law Commission\u2019s proposals implicitly constructed the moral debate over the \ndoctrine of adverse possession around a binary division between \u2018good faith\u2019 and \u2018bad \nfaith\u2019 squatters.  Yet, while the \u2018land theft\u2019 approach to adverse possession appears, \nprima facie, to provide a convincing justificatory basis for the Law Commission\u2019s \n 26\nagenda in relation to registered land, the Commission should not simply be accepted \nas having had the final word on the morality of \u2018bad faith\u2019 squatting, particularly in \nlight of its apparent lack of engagement with the traditional justificatory theories.  The \nactions of the \u2018bad-faith\u2019 squatter in an unsupervised property can be usefully \nconceptualised through the alternative perspectives of labour-desert theory, \npersonhood theory, and moral utilitarianism.  Each of these frameworks allows for the \npossibility that, in certain contexts \u2013 specifically, in the case of an advertent squatter - \nthe consequences of unauthorised occupation by a squatter may negate the original \ntitle-holder\u2019s moral claim, and provide a moral justification for the conduct of the \nsquatter.  The case of urban squatters, who make their homes in unsupervised \nproperties, brings this balance into sharp relief.   \n \nLocke\u2019s labour-desert theory is grounded in the idea that natural rights to land can be \nacquired through productive use.78  Locke was primarily concerned with justifications \nfor the acquisition of first ownership rights in un-owned or \u2018natural property\u2019, and he \nemphasised the need to reward the person who makes the highest and best use of the \nland: \u2018\u2026the useful labourer rather than the sluggard\u2026\u201979  Of course, a fundamental \ndifficulty, when it comes to applying this approach to adverse possession is the fact \nthat the land is already owned by the title holder and, as such, cannot be construed as \n\u2018natural property\u2019 in the Lockean sense.  However, this hurdle might arguably be \novercome by treating the title-holder\u2019s neglect of the land as a form of quasi-\n                                                 \n78 J Locke, Second Treatise on Government (Oxford: Blackwell, 1966). \n79 Ibid, p336.  For a critique of this approach see CM Rose, \u2018Possession as the Origin of Property\u2019 \n(1985) 52 University of Chicago Law Review 73. \n 27\nabandonment, so that the title-holder\u2019s claim would be diminished.80  On the other \nside of the balance, an urban squatter who occupies an unused property, and invests \ntime and energy into improving the property, may add weight to their labour-desert \nclaim.  Indeed, in many cases involving urban squatters who make their homes in \nempty buildings, there is evidence that they expend labour on buildings that have been \nleft in a state of disrepair,81 and this could arguably be viewed as giving rise to  a \nLockean moral claim.   \n \nAgainst this argument, it should be noted that, in some cases, properties may be left \nempty, undeveloped and in a state of disrepair because the landowner, rather than \nabandoning the property, has future plans for the development of the land.  The \nargument that the landowner\u2019s future plans for the use of land precludes the \nacquisition of title by the squatter has emerged intermittently in judicial decisions,82 \n                                                 \n80 Rose, for instance, has implied that in certain circumstances neglect of property by a landowner may \nallow a squatter to invest greater labour in the land, justifying the transfer of property through adverse \npossession; ibid, p79. \n81 See, for example Lambeth LBC v Archangel [2002] 1 P&CR 18, in which Mr Archangel turned his \nsquatted property into the premises of an organisation called Rehab II, the purpose of which was the \nrehabilitation of ex-offenders, some of whom had lived at the property.  Part of the evidence used \nagainst him when he sought title, as evidence that Archangel acknowledged that Lambeth had a \nsuperior right to the property, was a letter he wrote to Lambeth Council detailing a refurbishment \nproject that he was undertaking. \n82 See, for example, Leigh v Jack Leigh v Jack (1879) 5 Ex D 264; Wallis & Cayton Bay Holiday Camp \nLtd v Shell-Max & BP Ltd [1975] QB 94; Powell v McFarlane (1977) 38 P&CR 452 (for criticism of \nthis approach).  This \u2018implied licence\u2019 theory has been rejected and removed by statute (Limitation Act \n1980, Schedule 1, para 8(4) \u2013 which provided that a licence would not be implied due solely to the fact \nthat the squatter\u2019s occupation was not inconsistent with the landowner\u2019s plans for future use of the \n 28\nand was most recently revived in the context of registered land in Beaulane \nProperties Ltd v Palmer.83  At first sight, the idea that legal policy supports the \nlandowner\u2019s decision to leave the property empty appears to run contrary to the \nGovernment\u2019s current agenda in relation to empty properties, particularly empty \nhomes.84  It should be noted, however that the strategy of bringing empty properties \nback into use was not viewed by the Government as a justification for squatting: \nrather, the presence of squatters was seen as an obstacle in the path of local authorities \nwho are seeking to identify empty properties,85 and re-allocate those empty homes \naccording to statutory principles.  \n \nAnother perspective from which to view the morality of he urban squatter is to apply \nRadin\u2019s \u2018personhood\u2019 theory, which drew on Hegel\u2019s justification for private \nproperty,86 emphasised the relationship that develops between the individual and \ncertain items of property that become constitutive of their personhood, and argues that \nthese relationships should be protected because: \u2018\u2026to achieve proper self-\ndevelopment \u2013 to be a person \u2013 an individual needs some control over resources in the \nexternal environment.\u201987  The theory of \u2018property for personhood\u2019 clearly supports the \nidea that the value that the property represents to the urban squatter as a home might \n                                                                                                                                            \nproperty.

In Radin\u2019s analysis, the function of the personhood perspective \nwas to: \u2018\u2026serve as an explicit source of values for making moral distinctions in \nproperty disputes, and hence for either justifying or criticizing current law\u2019;88 and \nproperty that was occupied as a home was identified as a quintessential example of \n\u2018worthy\u2019 property.89   \n \nThe proposition that investing one\u2019s self in property gives rise to a moral claim \nagainst that property may justify some moral claim on the part of urban squatters who \noccupy empty properties as their homes.  Conversely, title-holders who leave their \nproperties unused and unsupervised, may have ownership of the thing, but do not \nmake use of the thing \u2013 a relationship that Hegel described as \u2018empty proprietorship\u2019 \nand thus as a \u2018madness of personality\u2019.90  Radin\u2019s personhood theory focused on \nsituations in which a person may become bound up with property through use and, \nconsequently, where that relationship between the person and the property may \nprovide an objective moral basis for legal protection.  A key example for Radin was \nthe occupier\u2019s relationship with his or her home, as this relationship was, based on \n                                                 \n88 MJ Radin, Reinterpreting Property (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1993), p35. \n89 Radin described different forms of property as being located on a continuum, ranging from property \nthat is constitutive of personhood (described as \u2018personal property\u2019) to property that carries no meaning \nbeyond its capital value (described as \u2018fungible property\u2019).  Radin argued that: \u2018\u2026in our social context \na house that is owned by someone who resides there is generally understood to be towards the personal \nend of the continuum.\u2019; ibid, p54.  For a detailed discussion of the applicability of \u2018property for \npersonhood\u2019 in the context of the home, see L Fox, Conceptualising Home: Theories, Laws and \nPolicies (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2007), Chapter Six.   \n90 Hegel, above n86, p91, (s62). \n 30\nsocial consensus, regarded as being likely to support healthy self-constitution.  In \ncontrast, the owner who has no use for the property was portrayed as a: \u2018caricature \ncapitalist\u2019,91 that: \u2018\u2026most people view\u2026with distaste\u2019.92  she claimed that: \u2018\u2026in our \nsocial context a house that is owned by someone who resides there is generally \nunderstood to be towards the personal end of the continuum.  There is both a positive \nsense that people are bound up with their homes and a normative sense that this is not \nfetishistic.\u201993   \n \nRadin\u2019s theory of \u2018property for personhood\u2019 offers an interesting alternative \nperspective on the relative moral claims of urban squatters, who make their homes in \nempty properties, and neglectful landowners.  It is certainly arguable that the \nsquatter\u2019s relationship with the land may garner moral approbation on the basis that \nthe squatter\u2019s interest in the property is personal, while the absentee landowner\u2019s \nclaim is towards the fungible end of the continuum.  One problem, however, is that \nwhile Hegel, on the one hand, was concerned with the first acquisition of ownership \ninterests, Radin presumed that the claimant seeking to assert personal property in an \nasset would already be the owner of that asset, and would be seeking to defend that \nownership against third party claims (for example, eminent domain).  Furthermore, \neven allowing unauthorised occupation to found the basis for a personhood claim, in \nstriking a balance between the competing interests of the squatter and the landowner, \nit would be necessary to demonstrate that the threat to the personhood of the squatter \noutweighs the personhood invested by a particular landowner in that property, and \n                                                 \n91 Radin, above n88, p44. \n92 Ibid. \n93 Ibid, p54.   \n 31\nthis also depends upon an assumption that the landowner has no \u2018personal\u2019 interest in \nthe property because he or she is out of possession.94   \n \nFor the landowner\u2019s personhood in the property to be reduced to the point that a \nsquatter could claim superior title, the landowner must no longer believe in his or her \nownership of the property, for example, when a squatter occupies a property that has \nbeen literally \u2018forgotten\u2019 by the landowner.95  Of course, there have been reported \ncases in which urban squatters have acquired title to properties belonging to local \nauthorities who had no knowledge of their ownership.96  However, this argument is \nless persuasive in the more usual case, in which individual landowners are aware of \ntheir ownership of property, but do not realise that a squatter is in occupation.  In such \ncircumstances it is much more difficult to conclude that the landowner\u2019s own \npersonhood has been extinguished.  Yet, it is important to bear in mind the context of \nthis discussion: even if it were accepted (for the sake of argument) that the \npersonhood approach does not suffice to justify re-distribution of title in favour of \nsquatters who occupy property as their home, it is arguable at least that the \n(im)morality of squatting raises complex jurisprudential issues, which were not \nadmitted under the Law Commission\u2019s agenda against adverse possession in \nregistered land.  \n                                                 \n94 Stake, above n6, p2456. Note, however, Posner\u2019s argument that: \u2018Over time, a person becomes \nattached to property that he regards as his own, and the deprivation of the property would be \nwrenching.  Over the same time, a person loses attachment to property that he regards as no longer his \nown, and the restoration of the property would cause only moderate pleasure.\u2019; R Posner, Economic \nAnalysis of Law (5th Edn, 1998) pp89-90. \n95 Posner, ibid. \n96 For example, in Ellis v Lambeth London Borough Council (1999)32 HLR 596.  \n 32\n Finally, it is arguable that the (im)morality of the urban squatter, as well as the case \nfor protecting neglectful landowners can be usefully viewed through the lens of moral \nutilitarianism.  Some commentators have argued that a utilitarian moral assessment, \nwhich prefers the outcome that achieves the maximum overall benefit for both \nlandowner and squatter, may justify the squatter\u2019s on-going use of the property, or \neven the acquisition of title through adverse possession, because the squatter has a \ngreater need than the landowner in relation to this property.  This argument seems \nparticularly persuasive when applied to a homeless squatter and a landowner who has \nno present use for the property.  It is arguable that a squatter who occupies property as \na home will inevitably have more need for the property than a landowner who is not \nusing the property.97  From this perspective, it is possible to distinguish different \ntypes of squatters, from those who extend the boundaries of their existing properties \n(who are, for one thing, already landowners and who are more likely to be of similar \nsocio-economic circumstances to the landowners they dispossess), to those who take \npossession of large tracts of rural land, who may put the property to use for farming, \nbut are not necessarily property-less, to urban squatters, who are more likely to \noccupy empty property because of need.   \n \nIt is interesting to note that the Law Commission did not view all urban squatters as \nmere opportunists, but did, to some extent, acknowledge the possible relevance of use \nvalue to an urban squatter.  In Land Registration for the Twenty-First Century, the \n                                                 \n97 Of course, Stake also challenges this model for the apparent licensing of theft on grounds of an \nindividual\u2019s relative poverty, together with the increases, once again, in costs of monitoring and \nprotection of property; above, n6, p2458.  \n 33\nLaw Commission recognised that unlawful occupation may sometimes arise from \nacute housing need, expressing \u2018understandable sympathy\u2019 for homeless squatters \nwho took possession of empty properties as a matter of necessity.98  However, the \nLaw Commission swiftly by-passed this issue by claiming that the proportion of \nclaims brought by this type of squatter was relatively small, and that: \u2018\u2026the much \nmore typical case in practice is the landowner with an eye to the main chance, who \nencroaches on his or her neighbour\u2019s land.\u201999  Yet, the moral blame attributed to \nadvertent squatting which, although arguably motivated by need, was labelled \u2018land \ntheft\u2019, compared to the forbearance shown to those who acted under a mistake as to \nboundaries, suggests that the Commission\u2019s \u2018sympathy\u2019 was extremely limited.  \n \nFennell has argued that there is an important class distinction between \u2018good faith\u2019 \ninadvertent squatters and \u2018bad faith\u2019 advertent squatters: \n\u2018The prototype squatter is poor and landless. People who own no land cannot \nmistakenly believe that the land they are occupying is their own.  In this \nregard, a good faith requirement is distributively conservative, designed to \nbenefit only the already-landed.\u2019100 \nFennell went on to argue that, rather than labelling inadvertent squatters as \u2018good \nfaith\u2019 squatters, and advertent squatters as \u2018bad faith\u2019 squatters, a justified advertent \nsquatter could be re-conceived as a \u2018higher-valuing user\u2019 of the land, who commits an \n\u2018efficient trespass\u2019.101  Although this argument could, controversially, be employed to \n                                                 \n98 Law Com No 271, above n13, para 2.70. \n99 Ibid. \n100 Fennell, above n6, p98.  \n101 Ibid.  \n 34\nsuggest that acquisition of title through adverse possession could provide a vehicle for \nproperty re-distribution, it also brings under question the argument that a squatter can \nnever obtain a superior title after deliberately taking possession of another person\u2019s \nland because they are guilty of blameworthy conduct.  Fennell argued that evidence of \nadvertence (or bad faith) should not, in itself, be sufficient to preclude a claim to land, \nsince the value that the land holds for the squatter might be so much greater than its \nvalue for the landowner as to justify the award of title to the squatter.   \n \nIn addition to its economic implications, this is also simultaneously and implicitly a \nmoral argument.  For one thing, Fennell\u2019s construction of squatters as \u2018higher-valuing \nusers\u2019 implicitly suggests a moral view on the question of who is a more deserving \nuser of the property between the squatter and the landowner.  Furthermore, by \nfocusing on the idea of \u2018market failure\u2019 (ie, the inability to buy the land) as the \nexplanation for the squatter\u2019s trespass, this analysis does not attribute \u2018blame\u2019 on the \nurban squatter.  Rather, the phenomenon of squatting is presented as a consequence of \nthe broader housing market trends, such as those that have been associated with high \nlevels of advertent urban squatting, particularly in London: that is, rising house prices, \ndepleted stocks of affordable housing and a high volume of empty properties.   \n \n(5) The \u2018morality\u2019 of the neglectful landowner   \n \nAs the discussion above has noted, the Law Commission\u2019s moral stance on adverse \npossession was premised, not only on the immorality of the squatter, but on the \nargument for protecting landowners who could not adequately supervise their land.  It \nis interesting to consider the argument that neglectful landowners should be protected \n 35\nby law, in light of recent scholarship on the landowner\u2019s duty of stewardship over \nproperty.  The ethical argument that land ownership imposes a duty of effective \nstewardship is based on the public interest in effective land use,102 and the view that: \n\u2018[t]he quest to protect the privileges of private property against all intruders regardless \nof the price or need \u2026 is an unholy one.\u2019103  Landowners, it is argued, must look \nbeyond their own selfish interests to ensure that the limited and vital commodity that \nis land is managed fairly on behalf of the community as a whole.  The growing \ncultural, political and legal importance placed upon the notion of land stewardship \nprovides another important ground on which to challenge the Law Commission\u2019s \nmoral conclusions from a utilitarian perspective.  A landowner who does not \nadequately fulfil the duty of stewardship might be said to have a morally weaker \nclaim to that property compared to an urban squatter who occupies it as a home.   \n \nThis \u2018stewardship\u2019 approach to land ownership appears to be reflected in the political \ndiscourses underpinning the Government\u2019s \u2018Empty Homes\u2019 project.  While the \nGovernment\u2019s concerns about the problem of empty homes do not support urban \nsquatting in these properties, it does clearly recognise systemic problems relating to \nthe housing market and, more importantly, the responsibilities of landowners in \nrelation to the utilisation of land, particularly homes.  The urban squatter\u2019s housing \nneed, combined with the landowner\u2019s lack of stewardship, provides an alternative \nmoral perspective on the phenomenon of urban squatting.  Yet, the presence of \n                                                 \n102 See, for example, JP Karp, \u2018A Private Property Duty of Stewardship: Changing Our Land Ethic\u2019 \n(1993) 23 Environmental Law 735.  LK Caldwell & K Shrader-Frechette, Policy for Land: Law and \nEthics (Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield, 1993), Ch 7 (Limits to Policy: Problems of \nConsensus). \n103 Karp, ibid. \n 36\nsquatters in empty properties is clearly regarded as part of the problem, and not part of \nthe solution for these empty properties.  The Empty Homes reports reflect what has \nbecome the standard moral view of squatters as lazy, feckless and troublesome \noccupiers whose presence is likely to have an adverse effect on the value of \nneighbouring properties.104  However, the Empty Homes project also reflects the \nsocio-economic impact of neglectful landowners who fail to carry out their basic \n\u2018stewardship\u2019 responsibilities in respect of land.  Local authorities are empowered \nunder the Housing Act 2004 to apply for an Empty Dwelling Management Orders, \nbased on the public interest of bringing property back into use, where owners either \ncannot be identified or are unwilling to bring their property back into use.105  This \ndevelopment can arguably be seen as recognition of an implicit stewardship duty on \nthe part of landowners.   \n \nAny stewardship duty should include a fundamental obligation to engage in an \nappropriate degree of supervision over empty land.  However, the Law Commission\u2019s \nproposals have little to say about the responsibilities of the absent landowner towards \nthe land.  Instead, focusing upon large landowners such as local authorities, and with \nan emphasis on the apparently insurmountable difficulties inherent in policing such \nlarge tracts of land, the Law Commission was willing to assume that all examples of \noversight leading to successful claims of adverse possession were not the fault of \nlandowners, but rather an unavoidable consequence of the ownership of huge volumes \nof land spread across large areas.  Of course, it is interesting to remember that large \n                                                 \n104 \u2018Empty Homes\u2019, above n64, p47. \n105 See Housing Act 2004, Chapter 2 and Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Empty Dwelling \nManagement Orders: Consultation on Secondary Legislation (London: HMSO, 2005). \n 37\nrural estates represent a substantial proportion of the remaining unregistered land in \nthis country, of which the Land Registry is keen to encourage voluntary first \nregistration.  Perhaps the Law Commission did not wish to appear unsympathetic to \nthe owners of such estates but, rather, to reassure them that registration would provide \nthe best protection available for their land.106 \n   \nNevertheless, the challenges of effective supervision seem less acute for landowners \nof smaller tracts of land; in addition, it is arguable that many large landowners are in a \nbetter position financially to effectively manage their property and should therefore be \nexpected to take much greater responsibility for surveillance.  Indeed, the landowner\u2019s \nduty of stewardship also emerged in the opinions of the dissenting judges of the \nEuropean Court of Human Rights in Pye v Graham when they concluded, in defence \nof the pre-2002 system of adverse possession, that: \u2018[p]ossession (ownership) carries \nnot only rights but also and always some duties.\u2019107  Of course, in many of the high-\n                                                 \n106 See Dixon, above  n15. \n107 In Pye v UK, above n40, the dissenting judges identify the varying degrees of supervision possible \nfor various different types of landowner when they claim that: \u2018The real \"fault\" in this case, if there has \nbeen any, lies with the applicant companies, rather than the Government.  It has to be born in mind that \nthe applicant company was not a private individual or an ordinary company with, one could assume, \nlimited knowledge on relevant real estate legislation.  They were specialised professional real estate \ndevelopers and such a company had or should have had full knowledge about relevant legislation and \nthe duties involved.  They should have had full access to the legal advice if need be and can not claim \nto be ignorant as to the adverse effects of the limitation legislation.  It should have been known to the \napplicants from the very beginning that their property right was subject to restrictions, qualifications or \nlimitations imposed by the pre-existing legal requirements of the Limitation Act.  The Government \nhave done no more than continue to operate a mechanism which, at the end of a relatively long \n 38\nprofile English cases, landowning local authorities failed to identify and respond to \nlong-term squatting because of maladministration.108  These cases clearly \ndemonstrated how, prior to the LRA 2002, properties could become \u2018forgotten\u2019 for \nlong enough (usually at least 12 years) to give rise to successful claims for title on \ngrounds of adverse possession, and \u2013 at least so far as the arguments against transfer \nof title were concerned -  appeared to impact strongly on the Commission\u2019s proposals.  \nHowever, while the Law Commission emphasised the particular undesirability of \nlosing properties that were funded by the public purse to squatters, the Commission \nutterly failed to recognise the moral responsibility of local authorities for the failure to \nadequately supervise its properties.   \n \nIndeed, one of the most extreme examples of apparent mismanagement by a local \nauthority was the case of Lambeth\u2019s housing department not merely \u2018forgetting\u2019 but \n\u2018losing\u2019 a number of properties.109  In one case the council had entirely forgotten that \nit owned a Victorian terraced house in Brixton and consequently failed to notice that a \nsquatter - Timothy Ellis \u2013 was in occupation of the property for more than 14 years, \n                                                                                                                                            \nlimitation period, adjusts land ownership to reflect the fact that an action for adverse possession is \ntime-barred.\u2019. \n108 Perhaps the most recent and well-known example of oversight is that of Lambeth Borough Council, \nwhich brought a number of high-profile actions against long-term urban squatters whom they had \nfailed to evict over a number of decades.  See for example, Lambeth London Borough Council v \nArchangel (2001) 33 HLR 44; Lambeth London Borough Council v Bigden (2001) 33 HLR 43; \nLambeth London Borough Council v Blackburn (2001) 82 P&CR 494. \n109 See Dyer, above n4.  In all, 20 properties were reportedly \u2018lost\u2019 by Lambeth Borough Council. \n 39\ngiving him the right to claim title to the property.110  Yet, while these cases were \n(historically) undoubtedly problematic, the maladministered-local-authority-as-\nlandowner appears to have been adopted as the quintessential landowner for the \npurposes of the Law Commission\u2019s moral stance on \u2018forgotten\u2019 properties.  The idea \nthat landowners who fail to adequately supervise their land should be protected \nagainst squatters presumes a lack of moral blame on the part of the landowners, and \u2013 \nthrough the moral essentialism of the Commission - has been applied not only to cases \ninvolving large tracts of land, but to all types of landowners, who are no longer \nrequired to exercise stewardship over their property but, rather, can rely on the state to \nprotect them against their own incompetence through the Land Registry\u2019s service of a \nnotice to the landowner before any real threat to title has been made.  In fact, the \nreforms in the LRA 2002 have made it quite unnecessary for landowners to satisfy the \nsurveillance obligations of a stewardship duty by effectively policing of that land \nagainst squatters. \n     \n(6) Acquisitive urban squatters? \n \nWhen it comes to protecting the landowner\u2019s title against successful claims for \nadverse possession, the notice mechanism set out the Land Registration Act 2002 will \nbe of considerable value to owners of forgotten properties \u2013 particularly local \nauthorities - occupied by urban squatters.  A failure to identify the presence of urban \nsquatters will never, in itself, result in the transfer of title, however long the squatter \n                                                 \n110 Ellis v Lambeth London Borough Council (1999) 32 HLR 596.  See also the case of the \u2018Calthorpe \nStreet Three\u2019, who successfully acquired title to a Grade II listed townhouse, valued at \u00a31 million; \nSmith, above n4. \n 40\nmay have been in occupation of the property.  The squatter\u2019s application for title will \nbe subject to the registered proprietor\u2019s power of veto;111 in fact, where a property \nowner has failed to oversee the property, the service of notice following an \napplication by the squatter would actually assist large-scale landowners in identifying \nsquatters on their land.  Unfortunately, however, the paradigm of the urban squatter \nalso highlights some significant \u2018knock-on\u2019 effects of this legislation.  Once again, the \nproblem with the Law Commission\u2019s proposals is that they adopt an essentialist view \nof the squatter.  The LRA 2002 appears to rest upon the portrayal of deliberate \nsquatters as acquisitive individuals, who squat on land for the purposes of acquiring \ntitle to the property.  Under the LRA 2002, urban squatters can only obtain title if they \nare willing to make themselves known to the landowner by applying to be registered \nand, by doing so, to expose themselves to the risk of eviction.  To do so, one would \nthink, the squatter would have to be strongly motivated towards securing legal title to \nthe property.   \n \nIt cannot be assumed, however, that the object of adverse possession for the urban \nsquatter is the acquisitive goal of moving from possession to title.  In fact, in perhaps \nthe majority of cases the urban squatter\u2019s objective is not to acquire ownership of the \nproperty, as registered proprietor, but rather to remain in occupation of the property, \nfor the time being: instead of \u2018squatting for title\u2019, the urban squatter \u2018squats for use\u2019.  \nThis view of the urban squatter is supported by Green, who characterised urban \nsquatters are \u2018those who use someone else\u2019s land but who do not necessarily want to \n                                                 \n111 Except in the limited circumstances outlined above, see n11 and associated text. \n 41\nbecome the \u2018owners\u2019 of it\u2019.112  Indeed, Prichard went further yet in assuming that an \nurban squatter \u2018will rarely be contemplating, and still less often be wishing, to acquire \nownership by limitation\u2019.113  Rather than viewing the property as an asset, the urban \nsquatter\u2019s interest lies with the temporary use and occupation of the property, usually \nas a home.  The problem with this construction of the urban squatter is that, if \nsquatters rationalise the use of forgotten properties in this way, there could be an \nimportant \u2018knock-on\u2019 effect following the enactment of the LRA 2002.  Viewed \nthrough the lens of \u2018squatting for use\u2019, the LRA 2002 may have some unfortunate \u2013 \nand perhaps unanticipated - implications for the effective management of \u2018forgotten\u2019 \nproperties.   \n \nFor an urban squatter who values the use rather than the title of property, however, it \nwill clearly be more rational to remain outside the system than to lodge a notice, thus \nalerting the owner to his presence in the property.  Urban squatters are likely to view \nthe prospect of lodging an application for title as a high risk strategy with little chance \nof success.  On the other hand, the squatter who keeps a low profile in a forgotten \nproperty can continue squatting for use until discovered by the landowner.  Of course, \nit would be folly to suggest that the windfall of title has, in earlier cases under the \nLand Registration Act 1925 and in unregistered land, been unwelcome.  However, in \nthe wake of the LRA 2002, a well-informed urban squatter is more likely to opt for \nremaining in undiscovered occupation, albeit under the on-going threat of discovery, \nrather than declaring themselves by making an application to the Land Registry and \n                                                 \n112 K Green, \u2018Citizens and Squatters: Under the Surfaces of Land Law\u2019 in S Bright and J Dewar (eds), \nLand Law: Themes and Perspectives (Oxford: OUP, 1998), p241. \n113 Pritchard, above n49, p257. \n 42\nthereby alerting the legal title holder to their presence.  In such cases - where the \nsquatter chooses not to gamble with their undiscovered occupation in pursuit of title, \nbut recognises the advantages of staying outside the system \u2013 this could have the \nundesirable consequence of rendering the properties which they occupy \u2018lost\u2019 \nindefinitely, in undiscovered limbo.    \n   \nFor the land owner of a forgotten property, the impact of the LRA 2002 is the shift \nfrom a situation in which the landowner becomes aware of the squatter but loses title \nto the land after 12 years undiscovered occupation, to a system in which the \nlandowner retains his title, but potentially fails to recover the use of the land, since the \nincentive for the squatter is to stay outside the system.  Of course, the primary \nobjectives of the LRA 2002 in relation to adverse possession related to squatting for \ntitle, rather than squatting for use.  Furthermore, the problem of \u2018land theft\u2019 by urban \nsquatters has clearly been solved, in that title is not lost, and to this end, the Act has \nsucceeded in protecting the title of land owners: the squatter who remains in quiet \noccupation, enjoying squatting for use, will never be able to gain title, but remains at \npermanent risk of identification and eviction from the premises.  Furthermore, so far \nas the system of title registration is concerned, whether the land owner has \u2018forgotten\u2019 \na property or not, so long as title is registered the information remains lodged with the \nLand Registry.  Whether the land owner has \u2018forgotten\u2019 about a property or not, the \nbureaucratic goals of title registration are satisfied.   \n \nNevertheless, it is arguable that the procedure by which adverse possession is \ngoverned under the LRA may have wider, negative consequences in relation to the \nuse of land.  Although the Land Registry \u2018knows\u2019 who owns the property, if the \n 43\nlandowner has \u2018forgotten\u2019 the property, and the squatter can neither obtain the title \nthrough a claim in adverse possession by mere effluxion of time, nor is likely to \njeopardise ongoing use by applying to be registered and thus providing a signal to the \nlandowner, there is a potential danger that the land could become economically and \nphysically sterile.  The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, in the context of its \n\u2018Empty Homes\u2019 project, has identified a range of negative effects linked with \n\u2018forgotten properties\u2019, including wasted financial resources for the Local Authority \nand owners; increased dereliction, vandalism, litter and, in extreme cases, arson; \nreduced market values in neighbouring properties and the wider area; and impacts on \nlocal businesses through reduced demand for goods and services, as well as potential \nknock-on effects - in areas of low demand - on the viability of public services, such as \nschools.114   \n \nIt is also important to bear in mind the welfare and housing consequences of on-going \noccupation by squatters in unsupervised properties.  The pressing need for new \nresidential accommodation across the country, and particularly in London, has \nprompted a drive to bring forgotten properties back into the market.  As the discussion \nabove has noted, the significance of properties falling outside the market was brought \ninto sharp relief by the Government\u2019s \u2018Empty Homes\u2019 initiative.  In 2003, Jeff \nRooker, former Minister of State for Housing, Planning and Regeneration at the \nOffice of the Deputy Prime Minister wrote that:  \n\u2018The reuse of empty homes and the conversion of vacant commercial property \nlie at the heart of the Government\u2019s commitment to securing an Urban \nRenaissance in our towns and cities.  But there remained nearly three quarters \n                                                 \n114 \u2018Empty Property\u2019, above n64, p6. \n 44\nof a million empty homes in England at the last count in April 2002 and a \nsubstantial amount of vacant commercial property that could be converted for \nhousing use\u2026each empty property is a wasted resource from the point of view \nof the owner, a wasted opportunity from the point of view of a developer and a \nwasted asset from the point of view of Local Authorities charged with \nbringing forward sufficient land and housing to meet projected housing \nneeds.\u2019115 \nYet, the presence of squatters in empty homes may conceal the fact that the properties \nare in fact \u2018un-used\u2019 for the purposes of Local Authority intervention.  Without the \n\u2018cloak of title\u2019, squatters are no longer able to come forward, claim title and thus bring \nthe property back within the market.  It is worth noting that the traditional doctrine of \nadverse possession did, at least, enable squatter to make their occupation public \nwithout fear of eviction and, after seeking modification of the register, to deal with the \nland as owner.  Under the LRA 2002, the urban squatter of a forgotten property is \nlikely to be motivated to live outside the land law system and so to use the property, \nbut outside the framework of the property or housing market.   \n \nThis would also mean that while squatters benefit from the use of the property \u2013 until \nthe landowner discovers them - without title, they will be unable to dispose of the \nproperty.  Since the squatter has no prospect of acquiring title, there will be less \nincentive to improve or maintain the property.  Of course, the squatter remains at \npermanent risk of discovery by the landowner.  In such cases, the absence of title will \nensure that any challenge to their occupation is likely to be successful, that the \nlandowner will regain possession, and the property will once again be brought into the \n                                                 \n115 Ibid, Ministerial Foreword, p4. \n 45\nmarket.  In the meantime, however, the attractiveness of \u2018squatting for use\u2019 as \nopposed to \u2018squatting for title\u2019, combined with the notice requirements under the \nLRA, will mean that for non-acquisitive squatters the possibility of remaining \nundiscovered will be preferable to risking loss of use.    \n \n(7) Conclusions \n \nThe object of the LRA 2002 was to: \u2018\u2026mak[e] dealings in land much simpler, \nquicker and cheaper\u2026mean[ing] that both title to registered land and the rights in and \nover it will be more secure\u2026\u2019;116 and there can be little doubt that the aim of ensuring \nthat landowners will not be susceptible to threats to title unless they no longer care to \ndefend their ownership has \u2013 subject to limited exceptions - been broadly achieved.  \nHowever, looking beyond the question of title, the reforms to the law of adverse \npossession achieved by the LRA can also be located within broader social, economic, \nmoral and cultural contexts.  The paradigm of the \u2018urban squatter\u2019 provides an \ninteresting lens through which to trace the impacts of these reforms, both intended and \nunintended.  One consequence, which appears to have been intended, is the new and \napparently unimpeachable moral stance adopted by the Law Commission towards \nadvertent squatters.  Despite the importance of macro-economic factors including \nrising house prices, low availability of affordable housing and a high volume of empty \nproperties, from the new phraseology of adverse possession as \u2018land theft\u2019, to the \ncharacterisation of squatters as primarily \u2018landowners with an eye to the main \nchance\u2019,117 the Law Commission has clearly identified squatters as morally \n                                                 \n116 Law Com No 254, above n7, Foreword. \n117 Law Com No 271, above n13, para 2.70. \n 46\n\u2018blameworthy\u2019.  Meanwhile, the absentee landowners of unsupervised properties have \nbeen constructed as blameless.  Yet, this simplistic account of the moral issues at \nstake in relation to both squatting and adverse possession fails to reflect the \ncomplexities involved in striking a balance between advertent squatters and neglectful \nland owners, as well as failing to take account of the knock-on effects of squatting for \nuse for the property market and the housing market. \n \nThe LRA 2002 has, by and large, ensured that a squatter\u2019s occupation will not be \ncapable of maturing into title without an application to the Land Registry, at which \npoint the landowner will be served with notice and will have a power of veto over the \ntransfer of title to the squatter.  However, the LRA will also have practical \nsignificance outside the realm of title, in the function of the new regime as a \ndisincentive to undisturbed squatters in undiscovered occupation of forgotten \nproperties, to declare themselves and seek legitimisation of their occupation.  The \nLRA allows the landowner the opportunity to object to the registration of the \nsquatter\u2019s title, however long the squatter has been in possession, and, subsequently, \nto bring an action to recover the land from the squatter.  Consequently, the preferable \ncourse of action for the urban squatter, on the presumption that they are likely to value \ncontinued use and occupation, over an action for title that is probably doomed to fail, \nmust be to protect their future use of the property for as long as possible by staying \noutside the system.  Furthermore, so long as these empty properties are occupied by \nsquatters, it is more difficult for local authorities to identify and appropriate them for \nre-use through the Government\u2019s \u2018Empty Homes\u2019 strategy.  While these \nconsiderations were arguably outside the remit of consideration for the drafters of the \nLRA, it is suggested that while the registered proprietor\u2019s title is protected by these \n 47\n 48\nreforms, there may also be an adverse effect when it comes to the identification and \nallocation of \u2018forgotten\u2019 properties occupied by urban squatters who are happy to live \noutside the system.   \n \nIt is also important to recognise that the Law Commission\u2019s approach to the issue of \nadverse possession was supported by a very clear and decisive policy agenda, not only \nin relation to title by registration, but also in relation to the construction of the \nadvertent squatter as a blameworthy individual, in contrast to its construction of \nlandowners who fail to supervise their land as blameless and deserving of law\u2019s \nprotection.  By adopting this position, without any explicit consideration of the \ncomplexities of urban squatting, or the matrix of moral issues at stake in cases \ninvolving squatting, the Law Commission appeared to close off any prospect of \nfurther debate on the subject.  Yet, reports indicating significant increases in the \nincidences of urban squatting suggest the converse: that it is now apposite to re-\nconsider the wide range of issues surrounding urban squatters, from the philosophical \nand moral construction of the squatter, to the social, cultural, economic and housing \nimplications of deliberate unlawful occupation in empty residential properties.    \n"}
