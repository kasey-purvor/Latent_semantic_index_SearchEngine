INTRODUCTION\nPlasmonics is a rapidly developing branch of optics. Sur-\nface plasmons attract particular interest due to their potential\napplications in medicine and chemistry1\u20133 as well as for op-\ntical switching4 and near-field photonics.5 Further, the recent\nexperimental demonstration of the strong coupling regime\nfor plasmon-polaritons in dielectric nanospheres embedded\nin gold films6 shows the potential of surface plasmons as the\nbasis of new light sources similar to polariton lasers.7\nA conventional surface plasmon-polariton is formed with\na TM polarization at the boundary of metallic and dielectric\nmedia.8 The decay of the surface plasmon into the metal is\nthe result of the metal\u2019s negative dielectric constant, while\nthe decay into the dielectric has the same origin as in total\ninternal reflection. The dispersion of the surface plasmon lies\noutside the light cone given by k=\u0001 \/c, where k is the in-\nplane component of the wave vector of light and \u0001 is the\nangular frequency, and it is for this reason that simple direct\noptical excitation of surface plasmons in planar structures\ncomposed of isotropic dielectric media is impossible. Al-\nthough surface plasmons can be excited at a metal-dielectric\ninterface using prisms or diffraction gratings, this approach\nis not always very convenient, or even practical, in experi-\nments or device applications.\nRecently, a simple, planar multilayer structure has been\nproposed for the creation of surface waves within the light\ncone. It has been shown that such states can be formed at the\ninterface between a dielectric Bragg mirror and a periodic\nstructure having layers of optical thickness close to half the\nwavelength of light.9 These states have been called optical\nTamm states in analogy with electron states predicted by\nTamm10 that can occur in the energy band gap at a crystal\nsurface. The linear and nonlinear optical properties of similar\nelectronic interface states have been studied theoretically by\nGaranovich et al.11 In contrast to a conventional surface plas-\nmon polariton, optical Tamm states can be formed in both the\nTE and TM polarizations. Their in-plane dispersion is para-\nbolic with an effective mass of the order of 10\u22125 of a free\nelectron mass and the splitting between the TE and TM po-\nlarized Tamm states increases quadratically with the in-plane\nwave vector. It has been shown theoretically that strong\ncoupling12 between the optical Tamm states and the excitonic\nresonance in a quantum well can be achieved in realistic\nstructures, and consequently it is possible that the states\ncould find application in the realization of a polariton laser\nwithout a cavity.\nIn this paper we consider the formation of a confined\nelectromagnetic mode at the boundary between an isotropic\nmedium with negative dielectric constant, such as a normal\nmetal below the plasma frequency, and a dielectric Bragg\nmirror. As in the case of a conventional plasmon-polariton,\nthe confinement in the metal is achieved as a result of its\nnegative dielectric constant, but the confinement in the di-\nelectric multilayer structure is due, not to total internal re-\nflection, but rather to a photonic stop band of the Bragg\nmirror. In analogy with Tamm electronic surface states in a\nsemiconductor, and the recently described Tamm photonic\nstates at the interface of two optical superlattices, we call\nsuch a state a Tamm plasmon \u0001TP\u0002. Electromagnetic states of\nthis type were first mentioned at an international workshop.13\nHere we describe an experimentally feasible system where\nTPs could be realized, and predict the results of experiments\nwhere such states could be observed and report the results of\nadditional calculations.\nII. OPTICAL STRUCTURE AND METHODS\nOF CALCULATION\nWe consider the planar multilayer structures of the type\nshown in Figs. 1\u0001a\u0002 and 1\u0001b\u0002, which are grown along the x\naxis and comprise a Bragg mirror on a metal layer. The\nBragg mirror has alternate dielectric layers of thicknesses a\nand b, with refractive indices nA and nB, respectively, such\nthat nAa=nBb=\u0002c \/2\u00010, where \u00010 is the Bragg frequency. A\nlayer of type A in the Bragg mirror is adjacent to the metal.\nWe now consider the possibility of the existence of an elec-\ntromagnetic state with a frequency below the plasma fre-\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 76, 165415 \u00012007\u0002\n1098-0121\/2007\/76\u000116\u0002\/165415\u00015\u0002 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society165415-1\nquency of the metal and close to the Bragg frequency of the\nperiodic dielectric structure that is localized near the bound-\nary of the metal and dielectric.\nThe eigenmodes of the structure can be obtained using a\nprocedure similar to that described in Ref. 14. For the arbi-\ntrary layered structure shown in Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002, we introduce two\nvirtual interfaces in one of the uniform layers and call the\namplitude reflection coefficient of a left propagating wave at\nthe left interface rleft and of a right propagating wave at the\nright interface rright, as indicated in the figure. Using the\ntransfer matrix method, we can write the equation for the\nfield of the eigenmode in terms of the amplitudes of right and\nleft propagating waves as\nA\u0003 1\nrleft\n\u0004 = \u0003exp\u0001i\u0003\u0002 00 exp\u0001\u2212 i\u0003\u0002 \u0004\u0003rright1 \u0004 , \u00011a\u0002\nwhere A is a constant and \u0003=nx\u0001 \/c is the phase change of\nthe wave of angular frequency \u0001 in propagating a distance x\nbetween the virtual interfaces if the refractive index of the\nlayer is n. Eliminating A from the two equations that follow\nfrom Eq. \u00011a\u0002 gives\nrleftrright exp\u00012i\u0003\u0002 = 1. \u00011b\u0002\nNow reducing x to zero, or in other words merging the vir-\ntual boundaries, one has\nrleftrright = 1. \u00011c\u0002\nThus, the condition for an eigenmode of the layered struc-\nture is that the product of the amplitude reflection coeffi-\ncients for the two waves incident from the left and the right\non the virtual interface \u0001where the refractive index has no\ndiscontinuity\u0002 is equal to unity. It follows that joining two\nstructures characterized by amplitude reflection coefficients\nthat satisfy Eq. \u00011c\u0002 will result in an eigenmode. We now\nshow that the condition of Eq. \u00011c\u0002 can be achieved at Bragg\nreflector-metal junctions of the type shown in Fig. 1.\nThe amplitude reflection coefficient of a metal, at fre-\nquencies well below its plasma frequency, is close to minus\none and the Bragg mirror has an amplitude reflection coeffi-\ncient close to minus one near the Bragg frequency, if the\nrefractive index of its first layer \u0001A\u0002 is greater than that of the\nsecond layer \u0001B\u0002, as is the case in Fig. 1. Placing the virtual\ninterface in the first layer of the Bragg reflector \u0001with refrac-\ntive index nA\u0002 infinitesimally close to the metal interface, we\ncan rewrite Eq. \u00011c\u0002 in the form\nrMrBR = 1, \u00011d\u0002\nwhere rM is the amplitude reflection coefficient for the wave\nincident on the metal from the medium with refractive index\nnA and rBR is the amplitude reflection coefficient of the wave\nincident from the medium with refractive index nA on the\nBragg mirror starting with a layer of the same refractive\nindex nA.\nThe reflection coefficient rM is given by the usual Fresnel\nformula rM = \u0001nA\u2212nM\u0002 \/ \u0001nA+nM\u0002 where nM is the refractive\nindex of the metal, which in the Drude model is given by\nnM\n2\n=\u0004b\u00011\u2212 \u0001p\n2\n\u0001\u0001\u0001+i\u0005\u0002 \u0002 in terms of the frequency \u0001, background\ndielectric constant \u0004b, plasma frequency \u0001p, and plasma col-\nlision rate \u0005.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 1\u0001a\u0002 shows the profile of the electric and magnetic\nfields of a TP near the interface of semi-infinite gold and a\nfree-standing 14-period GaAs\/AlAs quarter-wave Bragg re-\nflector characterized by a Bragg frequency \u0007\u00010=1 eV. The\ncomplex frequency of the TP in this case, obtained by nu-\nmerical solution of Eq. \u00011d\u0002, is \u0007\u0001TP= \u00010.9572\u20130.0015i\u0002 eV\n\u0001Q\u0005320\u0002. The nonzero imaginary component of the eigen-\nfrequency \u0001corresponding to decay\u0002 is explained by the flow\nof radiation from the right side of the structure and by ab-\nsorption in the metal. It should be noted that the electromag-\nnetic field of the TP decays much faster in the metal than in\nthe Bragg reflector; the penetration depth in the gold is\nc \/\u0001p\u000520 nm, while that in the Bragg reflector is \u0001in terms\nof the period D of the structure\u0002 D \/2\u000bnA\u2212nB\u000b\u00051500 nm.\nFigure 1\u0001b\u0002 shows the profiles of the electric and magnetic\nfields of the eigenmode of a 14-period GaAs\/AlAs quarter-\nwave Bragg reflector grown on a GaAs substrate covered by\n30-nm-thick gold film. The complex frequency of the TP in\nthis case is \u0007\u0001TP= \u00010.9527\u20130.0024i\u0002 eV \u0001Q\u0005200\u0002. The\nlarger decay in this case is explained by the additional leak-\nage through the metal film, which is now of finite thickness.\nFor both the semi-infinite metal and thin metal film cases,\nit is apparent from Figs. 1\u0001a\u0002 and 1\u0001b\u0002 that there is a near-\nquarter-wavelength shift between the maxima of the electric\nand magnetic fields near the metal. In other words the TP\nshows standing wave type behavior near the interface. How-\never, near the outer edge of the Bragg mirror the maxima of\nthe electric and magnetic fields are close to each other, cor-\nresponding to propagating wave behavior. Note that the time-\naveraged Poynting vector remains the same throughout the\nBragg reflector with the change in phase difference in the\nfields through the reflector being compensated for by the\nchanging field amplitudes. For the semi-infinite metal and a\nsemi-infinite Bragg reflector case, the field profiles in the\nBragg reflector have the structure of standing waves with\nexponentially decaying magnitude; the nodes of the electric\nfield coincide with the antinodes of the magnetic field and\nvice versa; and the time-averaged Poynting vector vanishes.\nFigure 2 shows the dependence of the TP energy on the\nin-plane wave vector K for the TE- and TM-polarized cases\nin a structure formed by a semi-infinite gold layer and a\nsemi-infinite Bragg reflector. Both modes exist within the\nlight cone and have parabolic dispersions in the vicinity of\nK=0. The parabolic shape of the dispersion curve allows us\nto define a TP effective mass m, and describe the dispersion\nrelation by the formula \u0007\u0001=\u00072K2 \/ \u00012m\u0002.

When the\nBragg reflector is finite, there will be a contribution to the\ndecay from radiative loss through it but that is insignificant\nfor the 14-period structure considered here. Even when both\nthe metal film and Bragg reflector are finite, the decay of the\nTP is as small as a few meV, corresponding to a Q factor of\nseveral hundred.\nFigure 3 shows the calculated reflection spectra for a 14-\nperiod Bragg reflector on a semi-infinite gold layer for dif-\nferent angles of incidence. For frequencies that are not eigen-\nfrequencies of the structure, the reflection is determined by\nthe reflection coefficient of the metal, which is close to unity\ndespite its nonzero absorption. At the eigenfrequencies, the\nabsorption increases and each TP is manifested in the spectra\nby a narrow dip in the reflection spectra. As illustrated in Fig.\n2, the positions of the dips in the spectra agree with the\ndispersion relation obtained using Eqs. \u00011a\u0002\u2013\u00011d\u0002.\nTPs can also be observed in the transmission spectra, de-\nspite the structure consisting of two objects which are almost\nopaque to the radiation at the frequency of the TP. The rea-\nson for the appearance of the peaks in the transmission is\nsimilar to those for a Fabry-Perot cavity.15 When the fre-\nquency of the incident radiation corresponds to the frequency\nof the eigenmode, energy is accumulated inside the structure\nand the magnitude of the field inside the structure is in-\ncreased compared to the magnitude in the incident wave as\nillustrated by the profiles of the fields shown in Figs. 1\u0001a\u0002\nand 1\u0001b\u0002. Thus, the flux of radiation incident on the Bragg\nmirror or metal film at the interface is increased by a Q\nfactor corresponding to the specific eigenmode, and the\ntransmission becomes substantial.\nFigure 4 shows transmission and absorption \u0001obtained as\nunity minus reflection and transmission\u0002 spectra for the same\n14-period Bragg reflector covered by a 30-nm-thick gold\nfilm for different angles of incidence. The positions of the\npeaks in the transmission spectra are slightly different from\nthe TP energies due to the finite thickness of the gold film\nresulting in a change of the phase of the amplitude reflection\ncoefficient rM in Eqs. \u00011a\u0002\u2013\u00011d\u0002.\nNote that the field profiles established in the structure un-\nder external excitation by a wave whose frequency corre-\nsponds to the eigenfrequency are similar to the field profile\nof the eigenmode if the imaginary part of the eigenfrequency\nis much smaller than its real part. There are peaks in the\ntransmission spectra, with frequencies corresponding to the\nTP modes, but with larger widths than the reflection spectra\nfor the structure used in those studies. The increase in width\nof the spectral features is a result of the leakage of radiation\nthrough the metal film of finite thickness. Note that if the\ngold film and the Bragg reflector were taken separately they\nwould reflect nearly all the radiation in the frequency range\nconsidered.\nAs well as just considering the situation in which there is\na quarter-wavelength high-index layer adjacent to the metal,\nwe can also study how the energy of the TP evolves as the\n0.94 0.95 0.96 0.97 0.98 0.99 1.00\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nR\nTE\nR\nEnergy (eV)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nTM\nFIG. 3.

Figure 5 shows the de-\npendence of the TP eigenenergy on the thickness of the first\nlayer of the Bragg mirror as it is varied from zero to half a\nwavelength. As we have seen, for a quarter-wave high-index\nfirst layer, the TP energy is within the photonic band gap.\nHowever, if the thickness is reduced, the TP energy passes\nacross the band gap and reaches the top edge, where decay is\nsignificant, before the layer thickness becomes zero. It is also\ninteresting to note that when layer A has zero thickness\nand the Bragg mirror begins with a low-index quarter-\nwavelength \u0001B\u0002 layer, there is no TP in the first band gap, but\none is predicted to occur within the second stop band, where\nthe phase of the amplitude reflection coefficient of the metal\ndiffers substantially from \u0002. However, such a TP would suf-\nfer strong absorption in the semiconductor layers considered\nhere.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have studied the possibility of the formation of a con-\nfined state of the electromagnetic field at the interface be-\ntween a metal and a dielectric Bragg mirror, which can be\nreferred to as a Tamm plasmon. It has been shown that for an\nappropriate order of the layers in the Bragg mirror, a Tamm\nplasmon appears in the vicinity of the center of the first stop\nband of the mirror. In contrast to the ordinary surface plas-\nmon, a Tamm plasmon can be formed with either TE or TM\npolarization and its dispersion lies within the light cone, and\nthus it can be optically excited without the aid of prisms or\ngratings.\n1 W.
