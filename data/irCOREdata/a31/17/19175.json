In the case of protein tyrosine nitration,\nthe modification can be considered a marker of nitrative\nstress [1]. Peroxynitrite (ONOO\u0001) anions, formed in the\nreaction of superoxide radical anions and nitric oxide\nradicals, or other nitrating agents, e.g., NO2\n\u2022 radicals,\nreact with tyrosine to produce the 3-nitrotyrosine mod-\nification [2\u20134]. The modification is of great interest as it\nmay be used as a diagnostic biomarker for diseases\ncaused by radical species [4\u20136]. Examples include car-\ndiovascular disease [7], Alzheimer\u2019s disease [8], and\natherothrombotic diseases [9]. The development of\nmethods for the identification of tyrosine-nitrated pro-\nteins and characterization of sites of 3-nitrotyrosine are\nkey for the understanding of the associated biological\nprocesses. Mass spectrometry approaches for the study\nof protein tyrosine nitration have been reviewed re-\ncently [1]. Most studies have utilized MALDI-TOF-MS,\nhowever electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (MS\/MS)\napproaches employing collision-induced dissociation\n(CID) mass spectrometry have also been applied.\nThe introduction of electron capture dissociation\n(ECD) [10, 11] in 1998 provided a unique fragmentation\ntechnique for biomolecular analysis.

CID and IRMPD are thermal\nprocesses in which the lowest energy bonds are cleaved\nfirst [15]. The differences lead to different sets of frag-\nmentation products being formed; ECD peptide back-\nbone cleavage occurs at the N\u2013C\u0001 bond, leading to c\nand z\u2022 (or c\u2022 and z) fragments [16, 17], whereas CID\nand IRMPD peptide backbone cleavage occurs at N\u2013CO\nbonds producing b and y ions [18].\nIn ECD, ions of interest are irradiated with low-\nenergy electrons (\u00020.2 eV) producing charge-reduced\nspecies, which dissociate along radical-driven path-\nways, though the precise mechanism is still of some\ndiscussion [17, 19, 20]. In summary, initial electron\ncapture to high-n Rydberg states was first proposed by\nMcLafferty and coworkers [10]. In the Cornell mecha-\nnism, the electron subsequently localizes to a site of\nprotonation (e.g., lysine or arginine side-chain) forming\na hypervalent radical. Hydrogen atom transfer to the\namide oxygen occurs followed by cleavage of the adja-\ncent N\u2013C\u0001 bond. A limitation of the Cornell mechanism\nis the failure to explain the observation of ECD frag-\nments for species in which mobile hydrogen atoms are\nabsent [21]. In the Utah-Washington (UW) mechanism\n[20, 22], following capture the electron is localized to\nthe amide \u0002* orbital rendering the amide bond su-\nperbasic. The amide anion radical subsequently ab-\nstracts a proton from an accessible site. That process\nmay involve a conformational change governed by\nPublished online October 22, 2009\nr Inc.

For\nexample, ECD is nonselective, the only exception being\ncleavage N-terminal to proline [23], and thus leads to\ngreater peptide sequence coverage [24, 25]. Arguably\nthe main benefit of ECD is the tendency of backbone\nfragments to retain labile posttranslational modifica-\ntions [26], cf CID and IRMPD, where cleavage of the\nPTM is generally the dominant fragmentation channel.\nECD has been shown to be successful for localizing sites\nof \u0003-carboxyglutamic acid [26], sulfation [26], N- and\nO-glycosylation [27, 28], phosphorylation [29, 30], acet-\nylation [31], oxidation [32], ubiquitination [33], and\nsumoylation [34].\nAlthough ECD has been applied to the characteriza-\ntion of a wide range of PTMs, the studies have not been\nexhaustive. Moreover, whilst ECD has generally been\nfound to be successful in the analysis of PTMs, one\ncannot conclude this will always be the case. For\nexample, interactions between phosphate groups and\nbasic amino acid side-chains have been shown to\nhave an adverse effect on the ECD fragmentation of\nphosphopeptides [35]. Beauchamp and coworkers have\nshown that the electron affinity (EA) of the species\nunder investigation may also affect ECD behavior [36].\nNone of the unmodified proteinogenic amino acids\nhave a positive electron affinity. However, it was shown\nthat benzyl modifications of cysteine with an EA of\n\u00041.00 eV, specifically 3-nitrobenzylcysteine (EA\u0003 1.00 eV\n[37] and 3,5-dinitrobenzylcysteine (EA \u0003 1.65 eV [38],\ntermed \u2018electron predators\u2019, inhibit peptide backbone\ncleavage by ECD and the related electron-transfer dis-\nsociation (ETD) completely [36]. Identical rates of elec-\ntron capture were observed for doubly-charged pep-\ntides containing modifications with disparate EA\nsuggesting initial electron capture is governed by long-\nrange interactions, i.e., the electron is captured to high-n\nRydberg states, as proposed by McLafferty [10]. Once\ncaptured, electron relaxation via through-space or\nthrough-bond transfer to the high-EA modification\n(electron predator) occurs in competition with transfer\nto the amide \u0002* orbital (UW mechanism). The radical\nanions formed by the electron predator have high\nproton affinities thus enabling proton transfer from a\nsite of protonation. The result is a stable radical inter-\nmediate, which does not undergo N\u2013C\u0001 cleavage to\nproduce c\/z ions. It was suggested that 3-nitrotyrosine-\ncontaining peptides may also behave as electron pred-\nators due to the structural similarity of nitrotyrosine\nand nitrobenzylcysteine [36].\nIn this work, we investigate the effect of 3-nitrotyrosine\non the electron capture dissociation behavior of pep-\ntides. The ECD and CID of the synthetic peptides\nGPLEnYGFAK, GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK, the synthetic\nfibrinogen \u0005-chain peptide NYCGLPGEnYWLGNDK\n(known to be susceptible to tyrosine nitration at this\nsite in vivo [9]), the myoglobin tryptic peptidenYLEFISDAIIHVLHSK (nY denotes 3-nitrotyrosine),\nand their unmodified counterparts were determined.\nThe results show that for doubly-charged peptide\nions the presence of 3-nitrotyrosine has a deleterious\neffect on ECD backbone cleavage. The ECD mass\nspectra reveal abundant neutral losses from the\ncharge-reduced precursor. The origin of these neutral\nlosses was investigated by use of activated ion (AI)\nECD [39], with further insight provided by ECD of an\nisotopically labeled 15NO2-tyrosine-containing pep-\ntide, and a peptide series with variable sites of nitro-\ntyrosine (AxnYAyK, where x, y \u0003 0 \u2013 6 and (x \u0004 y) \u0003\n6). For triply-charged peptides, in addition to the\nabundant neutral losses, some ECD backbone cleav-\nage is observed. That observation is discussed in\nterms of competing electron relaxation processes.\nExperimental\nPreparation of Synthetic Peptides\nThe nitrated peptides, GPLEnYGFAK, GPLEnYGFAKGP-\nLAK, and NYCGLPGEnYWLGNDK (a fibrinogen\n\u0005-chain tryptic peptide), their unmodified counterparts\nand an AxnYAyK series (where x, y \u0003 0\u20136, and x \u0004 y \u0003\n6) were synthesized by Alta Bioscience (Birmingham,\nUK) and used without further purification. The peptides\nwere diluted to 2 pmol\/\u0006L in methanol (Fisher Scientific,\nLeicestershire, UK):water (J.T. Baker, Deventer, The Neth-\nerlands) (50:50), and 1% formic acid (Fisher Scientific).\nEquine skeletal myoglobin (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole,\nDorset, UK) was electrochemically nitrated in a water-\ncooled cell at 284 \u0005 2 K, with the potential fixed at 1.05\nV versus Ag\/AgCl\/Cl\u0001 (3 M) using an Amel Instru-\nments 2053 potentiostat (Milan, Italy). The cathodic\ncompartment was a 5 mm diameter cylindrical chamber\nseparated from the anodic compartment by a nonselec-\ntive sintered glass membrane. A platinum wire from\nGoodfellow (0.5 mm diameter, \u000499.995% purity) was\nused as the counter electrode. The cathodic compart-\nment was filled with 1 mL of buffer solution comprising\n50 mM Na2B4O7 \u00b7 10H2O and 50 mM NaNO2 adjusted\nto pH 9.0 with H3BO3. A 0.1 \u0006 2.5 \u0006 5.0 cm bipolar\nboron-doped diamond working electrode was pre-\ntreated by cycling the electrode between 0 and 4 V\nversus Ag\/AgCl, 0.1 V s\u00011, 10 cycles, in 1 M nitric acid,\nand thereafter electrodes were thoroughly rinsed with\nultrapure water. Buffer solution (50 mL) contained 1 mg\nmL\u00011 of protein. Sodium nitrite concentration was 50\nmM. Electrosynthetic nitration was monitored with a\nDigatron electronic A \u00b7 h coulometer (Aachen, Ger-\nmany) by measuring the charge passed through the\ncircuit. The nitration was expected to take place at\nTyr103 [40]. The reaction mixture was extensively dia-\nlyzed against 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, using\nSpectra\/Por (Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA) molecular\nporous membrane tubing with 3500 Da cut-off. Samples\nwere subsequently freeze-dried and stored at \u000120 \u00b0C.\nNitrated myoglobin was digested with trypsin (Trypsin\n270 JONES ET AL.

Digestion\nwas quenched with formic acid (0.5% vol\/vol) and the\npeptides were desalted using a Michrom C18 Macrotrap\n(200 \u0006g capacity). The digest was diluted to a final\nconcentration of\u00072 pmol\/\u0006L in methanol:water (50:50)\nand 1% formic acid.\n15N-isotopicnitrotyrosinelabelingofGPLEYGFAKGPLAK\nwas completed by the electrochemical procedure de-\nscribed above, with the exception that \b98% 15N labeled\nsodium nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, Dorset, UK) was\nused.\nMass Spectrometry\nAll tandem mass spectrometry analyses were per-\nformed on a Thermo Finnigan LTQ FT mass spectrom-\neter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Sam-\nples were injected by use of an Advion Biosciences\nTriversa electrospray source (Advion Biosciences, Ithaca,\nNY, USA) at a flow rate of \u0007200 nL\/min.\nAll MS\/MS spectra were acquired in the ICR cell\nwith a resolution of 100 000 at m\/z 400.\nECD. Precursor ions were isolated in the linear ion\ntrap and transferred to the ICR cell for ECD. Automatic\ngain control (AGC) target was 5 \u0006 105 with maximum\nfill time 2 s. Isolation width was 5 m\/z. Electrons for\nECD were produced by an indirectly heated barium-\ntungsten cylindrical dispenser cathode (5.1 mm diame-\nter, 154 mm from the cell, 1 mm off axis) (Heat-Wave\nLabs, Watsonville, CA, USA). The current across the\nelectrode was \u00071.1 A. Ions were irradiated with elec-\ntrons for 70 ms at 5% energy (corresponding to a\ncathode potential of \u00012.775 V). Each ECD scan com-\nprises 4 co-added microscans. Mass spectra shown\ncomprise 100 averaged scans.\nActivated ion (AI) ECD. Photons for infrared irradiation\nwere provided by a 75 W in-built CO2 laser (Synrad,\nMikilteco, WA, USA) for 100 ms and measured as percent\nof the maximum (i.e., 75 W). Infrared irradiation was\nfollowed by ECD with an 85 ms delay [41]. Thirty AI ECD\nscans were recorded at laser powers ranging from 0 to\n50% etc. Each AI ECD scan comprised 10 co-added\nmicroscans. Experiment was completed in triplicate.\nCID. CID experiments were performed in the linear\nion trap and the fragments transferred to the ICR cell\nfor detection. AGC target was 1 \u0006 106, maximum fill\ntime 1 s. Isolation width was 5 m\/z. CID experiments\nwere performed with helium gas at normalized colli-\nsion energy 35%. Each CID scan comprises four co-\nadded microscans. Mass spectra shown comprise 100\naveraged scans.\nData were analyzed using Xcalibur 2.05 software\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific). All mass spectra were man-\nually searched for a, b, c\u2022\/c, y, and z\u2022\/z fragment ionsusing Protein Prospector ver. 5.2.2 software (UCSF, San\nFrancisco, CA, USA) [42].\nResults and Discussion\nFigure 1 shows the mass spectra obtained following\nCID and ECD of the doubly-charged peptide ions. With\nthe exception of the myoglobin peptide, ECD resulted\nin virtually complete sequence coverage (Figure 1,\nleft-hand column) of the unmodified peptides. For the\nunmodified myoglobin peptide, four of the fifteen\nN\u2013C\u0001 bonds were cleaved. The addition of nitration on\nthe tyrosine on the peptide drastically decreases the\nECD sequence coverage in all cases (Figure 1, middle\ncolumn). A striking feature of the ECD mass spectra\nobtained from the nitrated peptides is the presence of\nintense peaks corresponding to neutral losses from the\ncharge-reduced [M \u0004 2H]\u0004\u2022 species. The neutral losses\nobserved are summarized in Table 1. All nitrated pep-\ntides exhibited multiple neutral losses following elec-\ntron capture, and in all cases the abundance of at least\none of these fragment ions is greater than the abun-\ndance of the charge-reduced ions. The abundances of\nthe peaks corresponding to neutral losses appear to be\npeptide dependent. For example, the most abundant\nproduct following ECD of [GPLEnYGFAK \u0004 2H]2\u0004\nions was loss of [\u2022OH \u0004 H2O \u0004 NH3], whereas for\n[GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK \u0004 2H]2\u0004 ions it was [H2O \u0004\nNH3]. The addition of nitration did not affect CID behav-\nior for these peptides. Extensive sequence coverage was\nobserved for both unmodified peptides (data not shown),\nand modified peptides (Figure 1, right-hand column).\nECD MS\/MS of the triply-charged peptides\n[GPLEnYGFAK \u0004 3H]3\u0004 and [nYLEFISDAIIHVLHSK \u0004\n3H]3\u0004 are shown in Figure 2. Addition of a third proton\nto the nitrated peptides leads to improved sequence\ncoverage with four extra c and z ions being identified\nfor GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK, and eight more c and z ions\nbeing noted for nYLEFISDAIIHVLHSK. As with the\ndoubly-charged peptides, intense peaks corresponding\nto neutral losses from the charge-reduced species are\nobserved (see Table 1).\nNitration of tyrosine severely inhibits N\u2013C\u0001 back-\nbone cleavage following electron capture by doubly-\ncharged peptide ions. That result can be explained in\nterms of the \u2018electron predator\u2019 model proposed by\nSohn et al. [36]: following electron capture to high-n\nRydberg states, through-space or through-bond electron-\ntransfer occurs to the 3-nitrotyrosine, rather than the\n\u0002* orbital associated with c\/z-type cleavage (UW mech-\nanism). The 3-nitrotyrosine anion radical then abstracts\na proton from elsewhere in the peptide thus halting the\nnormal sequence of events. Based on the proton affini-\nties of the amino acid side-chains and N-terminus, and\ncharge-repulsion factors, the doubly-charged peptides\nstudied here are predicted to be protonated at the\nN-terminus and on the side-chain of the C-terminal\n271J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 2010, 21, 268\u2013277 ECD MASS SPECTROMETRY OF TYROSINE NITRATED PEPTIDESlysine residue. Proton transfer may occur from one of\nthese sites or, alternatively, may be the result of proton\nabstraction from the adjacent phenol group to which it\nis hydrogen bonded (see below).

Given that events following electron cap-\nture appear to be different to those for \u2018standard\u2019\npeptides, it cannot be concluded that hydrogen atom\nloss proceeds as in \u2018standard\u2019 peptides. Losses of hy-\ndroxyl radicals, water and ammonia are also observed.\nPol\u00e1\u0161ek and Turec\u02c7ek [44] have shown that the phe-\nnylnitronic radical is stable on the microsecond scale\nand undergoes unimolecular dissociation via hydroxyl\nloss. Sohn et al. [36] observed hydroxyl loss follo-\nwing ECD of doubly-charged peptides containing\n3-nitrobenzylcysteine and 3,5-dinitrobenzylcysteine.\nThey concluded that formation of the nitrobenzyl rad-\nical anion was followed by intramolecular proton trans-\nfer and subsequent homolytic cleavage of the N\u2013OH\nbond. They also noted that loss of \u2022OH was especially\nprominent with higher levels of vibrational excitation,\ni.e., in activated ion ECD and ETD with supplemental\nactivation. Loss of \u2022OH is observed for all of the\n3-nitrotyrosine containing peptides studied here, although\nthis channel is very weak for [GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK \u0004\n2H]2\u0004 precursor ions. We conclude that a similar pro-\ncess occurs, i.e., the nitrotyrosine radical anion is\nformed on electron capture and is followed by intramo-\nlecular proton transfer. The proton may be transferred\nfrom a lysine side-chain, however it is worth noting that\naddition of a nitro-group to tyrosine increases the\nacidity of the phenolic hydrogen (pKa 7.2 [45]. At acidic\npH the hydroxyl group remains uncharged but is\ninvolved in hydrogen bonding to the neighboring ni-\ntration modification [46]. Hence possibly proton trans-\nfer from the phenol group occurs.\nAnalysis of isotopic distributions in the ECD mass\nharge state.

However, possibly the [M \u0004 2H]\u0004\u2022 \u000118 peak\ncorresponds to loss of \u2022OH plus loss of \u2022H. Similar analysis\nof the ECD mass spectrum of [nYLEFISDAIIHVLHSK \u0004\n2H]2\u0004 ions (Figure 3e) shows the presence of both [M \u0004\nH]\u0004 and [M \u0004 2H]\u0004\u2022 ions and peaks corresponding to\nthe loss of 17.004 Da from both. The neutral loss peaks\nhave the same ratio of abundances as the [M \u0004 H]\u0004\u2022 and\n[M\u0004 2H]\u0004\u2022 peaks, suggesting that the loss of \u2022OH occurs\nboth from [M \u0004 H]\u0004 and [M \u0004 2H]\u0004\u2022 in this case.\nWater loss after \u2022OH loss is observed for all peptides\nexcept GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK, where the combined loss\nof [H2O \u0004 NH3] is observed. Possibly, the water loss is\nrelated to hydrogen bonding of the phenol group to the\nnitro-group, however this might suggest additional loss\nof \u2022OH, which we do not observe. Sohn et al. [36]\nobserved additional water loss in the AI ECD and ETD\nwith supplemental activation of the nitrobenzylcysteine-\ncontaining peptides, but following ECD this additional\nwater loss was not noted. That suggests that water loss\nis associated with higher vibrational excitation, and it\nmay be that the precursor ions in our experiments are\n\u2018hotter\u2019 than those in Beauchamp\u2019s. Further indication\nof higher internal energy of the precursor ions in these\nexperiments is the extensive hydrogen atom loss ob-\nserved following ECD. Such losses were only observed\nfollowing AI ECD in the experiments of Beauchamp\nand coworkers.\nIn addition to losses of \u2022OH and water, we observed\nFigure 3. Expanded m\/z regions of ECD mas\nlosses from the charge-reduced cation radical\n[GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK\u0004 2H]2\u0004, (c) [GPLEnYGFA\n2H]2\u0004, (e) [nYLEFISDAIIHVLHSK \u0004 2H]2\u0004, an\n(\tm) from the mass of the charge-reduced [M\u0004\ntriply-charged precursor ions, respectively, are ilosses of ammonia from the charge-reduced precursors.Losses of ammonia are not uncommon following ECD\nof peptides, for example, see Figure 1d; however the\nabundances of the fragments involving ammonia loss\nfrom the nitrated peptides are remarkable. Moreover\nlosses of ammonia did not occur in isolation but always\noccurred together with losses of other neutral species,\nFigure 3a\u2013d, Table 1. For peptides GPLEnYGFAK and\nGPLEnYGFAKGPLAK the neutral losses involving am-\nmonia produced the most abundant ECD product. For\ndoubly-charged GPLEnYGFAK precursors, the most abun-\ndant product of ECD corresponds to loss of [\u2022OH\u0004H2O\u0004\nNH3]. For doubly-charged GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK\nprecursors, it is loss of [H2O \u0004 NH3], and for triply-\ncharged precursors it is [\u2022OH \u0004 H2O \u0004 NH3]. For\n[NYCGLPGEnYWLGNDK \u0004 2H]2\u0004 ions, loss of\n[\u2022OH \u0004 H2O \u0004 NH3] is a minor product. No losses\ninvolving ammonia were observed for either 2\u0004 or 3\u0004\nions of nYLEFISDAIIHVLHSK, nor were any neutral\nlosses involving ammonia observed following ECD of\nthe nitrobenzylcysteine containing peptides studied by\nBeauchamp and coworkers [36]. As mentioned, ammo-\nnia loss was not observed in isolation in ECD of any of\nthe nitrated peptides, but followed an initial loss of\n\u2022OH or H2O. Apparently the ammonia loss is intrinsi-\ncally linked with the nitrotyrosine radical anion formed\nfollowing electron capture although the mechanism is\nunclear. 15N-isotopic labeling of the nitro- group reveals\nthat it is not the origin of the ammonia nitrogen\n(see Supplemental Figure 1, which can be found in the\nctra showing peaks corresponding to neutral\nprecursor ions: (a) [GPLEnYGFAK \u0004 2H]2\u0004, (b)\nLAK \u0004 3H]3\u0004, (d) [NYCGLPGEnYWLGNDK \u0004\n[nYLEFISDAIIHVLHSK \u0004 3H]3\u0004.

J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 2010, 21, 268\u2013277monia is lost from a protonated lysine side-chain which is\ninteracting with the nitro-group. As described above, for\nthe doubly-charged peptides studied, the predicted protona-\ntion sites are the N-terminus and the C-terminal lysine\nside-chain. For triply-charged GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK, the\nadditional protonation site is predicted to be the side-\nchain of the central lysine, and for 3\u0004 ions of\nnYLEFISDAIIHVLHSK the side-chain of one of the histidine\nresidues. The results for peptide nYLEFISDAIIHVLHSK\nsuggest that the lysine side-chain is too distant from the\nnitro-group to initiate ammonia loss. Similarly, peptide\nNYCGLPGEnYWLGNDK shows only weak ammonia\nloss. The most abundant ECD product of both\n[GPLEnYGFAK\u00042H]2\u0004 ions and [GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK\u0004\n3H]3\u0004 is loss of [\u2022OH \u0004 H2O \u0004 NH3]. Both of these\nspecies are expected to be protonated on Lys9 which we\nhypothesize is involved in noncovalent bonding with\nthe nitro-group. If this is the case, we would expect the\nrelative abundance of these peaks to decrease if the\nprecursor ions are activated before ECD such that\nunfolding is induced. AI ECD was performed on these\nspecies and the results are presented in Figure 4a and c.\nThe near-threshold AI ECD mass spectra are shown in\nFigure 4b and d. Infrared irradiation was followed by\nECD with an 85 ms delay to ensure that ECD was\nperformed on unfolded ions [41]. As can be seen, there\nis a rapid decrease in the relative abundance of the\n[\u2022OH\u0004H2O\u0004NH3] neutral loss peaks with increasing\npre-ECD activation. A less pronounced decrease in\nrelative abundance is also noted for the other observed\nneutral loss peaks. The AI ECD results for doubly-\ncharged GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK are shown in Figure 4e\nand f and are less straightforward to interpret. The peak\ncorresponding to loss of [H2O \u0004 NH3] rapidly de-\ncreases in abundance, however this is accompanied by\nan increase in the abundance of the peaks correspond-\ning to [\u2022OH \u0004 H2O \u0004 NH3], [\u2022OH \u0004 H2O \u0004 NH3 \u0004\nH2O] and [\u2022OH] up to \u000730% laser power, followed by\na general decrease which coincides with the onset of\nIRMPD. This result suggests IR activation promotes loss\nof \u2022OH, however it should be noted that the fragment\nis a combination of neutral losses which cannot be\ndeconvoluted with certainty. Beauchamp and cowork-\ners [36] also observed increased loss of \u2022OH at higher\nvibrational energy levels. The contradiction in our find-\nings may indicate differences in the mechanisms of\n\u2022OH loss in the various peptide ion structures. It\nshould also be noted that the variations in abundance of\nthe neutral loss peaks with ion activation may reflect\ncompetitive dissociation channels and their dependence\non ion internal energies rather than simply being the\nresult of interruption of a particular fragmentation\nchannel (i.e., loss of ammonia) by removal of non-\ncovalent bonds.\nThe AI ECD mass spectra shown in Figure 4b, d, and\nf, give further credence to the hypothesis that the\nnitrotyrosine acts as an electron trap and prevents\nbackbone cleavage. As discussed above, if N\u2013C\u0001 cleav-\nage was occurring but the fragments were held togetherby intramolecular hydrogen bonds, then activation\nshould release the fragments by disrupting these non-\ncovalent bonds (post-ECD activation), or allow direct\nobservation of the fragments by unfolding the precur-\nsor ion (pre-ECD activation). Both pre-ECD activation\n(Figure 4b, d, and f) and post-ECD activation (see\nSupplemental Figure 2) show no significant increase in\nc\/z-type fragmentation. Some increase in the relative\nabundances of y fragments is observed in the AI ECD\nmass spectra. That observation is likely the result of the\nincreased internal energy of the peptide ions.\nTo further investigate the hypothesis that the ammo-\nnia is lost from a protonated lysine side-chain, which is\ninteracting with the nitro-group, we performed ECD on\nseries of peptides AxnYAyK, where x, y \u0003 0-6, and (x \u0004\ny) \u0003 6. The dependence of the position of the nitroty-\nrosine with respect to the protonated lysine on the loss\nof ammonia and other neutral species is shown in\nFigure 5. The ECD mass spectra of these peptides and\ndoubly-charged AAAAAAAK are shown in Supple-\nmental Figure 3. Previous work in our laboratory has\nsuggested that the ECD behavior of polyalanine species\nis nonstandard. The dominant fragmentation channels\ninvolve b\/y-type cleavage (see Supplemental Figure\n3h), i.e., do not proceed via the Cornell and\/or UW\nmechanism. That behavior was also observed by Tsybin\nand coworkers [47] and is seen here for the AxnYAyK\npeptides. We postulate that the atypical behavior is\nlikely a consequence of the secondary structure of these\npeptides [48] but that hypothesis requires further inves-\ntigation and is beyond the scope of the present paper.\nThe important point in the present context is that the\npeaks corresponding to neutral losses involving ammo-\nnia show marked increases in relative abundance as the\nproximity of the nitrotyrosine and lysine residues in-\ncreases, in contrast with those observed for \u2022OH and\n[\u2022OH \u0004 H2O]. No ammonia loss was observed when\nthere are greater than four amino acids between the two\nfunctional species. Once the nitrotyrosine is within this\nfour amino acid threshold for these peptides there is a\nmajor loss of ammonia and the [\u2022OH \u0004 H2O \u0004 NH3]\nneutral losses become the most abundant.\nEffect of Charge-State on ECD Behavior of\nNitrated Peptides\nAs mentioned above, the ECD mass spectra of the\ntriply-charged ions of peptides GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK\nand nYLEFISDAIIHVLHSK show neutral losses; how-\never they also reveal far greater peptide sequence\ncoverage than for their doubly-charged counterparts,\nFigure 2. Possibly, the differences observed between the\nECD of doubly- and triply-charged nitrated peptides is\nsimply the result of the repulsion between the dissoci-\nating fragments. However, AI ECD of the doubly-\ncharged peptides did not result in a significant increase\nin the number or relative abundance of sequence frag-\nments (see above).\n275J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 2010, 21, 268\u2013277 ECD MASS SPECTROMETRY OF TYROSINE NITRATED PEPTIDESThree possibilities exist to explain the behavior of the\ntriply-charged nitrated peptides. First, the electron\nFigure 4.

Tbetween the electron predator model and the Cornell\n276 JONES ET AL. J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 2010, 21, 268\u2013277and\/or UW mechanism. Finally, the observations may\nbe the result of secondary electron capture, i.e., capture\nof the first electron proceeds via the electron predator\nmodel and capture of the second electron proceeds via\nthe Cornell and\/or UW mechanism resulting in c\/z-type\ncleavage.\nThere are two key observations: All of the sequence\nfragments observed for the triply-charged precursors\nare singly-charged, with the exception of c15\n2\u0004 ions\nfrom ECD of [nYLEFISDAIIHVLHSK\u0004 3H]3\u0004 ions. For\nboth peptides, no fragments are observed in the vicinity\nof the nitrotyrosine residue and those that are observed\nderive from the C-terminal region. The ECD mass spectrum\nof unmodified triply-charged GPLEYGFAKGPLAK is\nshown in Supplementary Figure 4. (Unmodified triply-\ncharged YLEFISDAIIHVLHSK was not observed in the\nmyoglobin digest and hence the results are not availa-\nble for comparison). All possible N\u2013C\u0001 cleavages of\nGPLEYGFAKGPLAK were observed. In addition,\ndoubly-charged fragments c13\n2\u0004, z12\n2\u0004, and z11\n2\u0004 were\nobserved. Clearly, the presence of the nitrotyrosine\ninhibits c\/z-type cleavage within the triply-charged\nspecies in a manner comparable to that observed for\ndoubly-charged peptides. The conclusion drawn is that\nthere does exist a competition between the electron\npredator model and c\/z-type fragmentation. The ques-\ntion remains: Is that competition biased such that the\nelectron predator model prevails over c\/z-type fragmen-\ntation, i.e., are all c\/z fragments the result of secondary\nelectron capture? The lack of doubly-charged fragments\nfrom GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK and the presence of doubly-\ncharged fragments from GPLEYGFAKGPLAK sug-\ngest that may be the case. It should be noted that the\nrelative abundance of the doubly-charged fragments in\nthe modified species is low and that a lack of doubly-\ncharged fragments is not uncommon in the ECD of\ntriply-charged fragments (for example, see [49]. More-\nover, triply-charged nYLEFISDAIIHVLHSK yields c15\n2\u0004\nfragments, which are clearly the result of single electron\ncapture and the Cornell and\/or UW mechanism.\nThe fact that no fragments are observed in the\nvicinity of the nitrotyrosine residue for either peptide\nsuggests that the conformation of the peptide ions is\nimportant. As described above, the probable protonation\nsites for triply-charged GPLEnYGFAKGPLAK are the N-\nFigure 5. Effect of nitrotyrosine position on the abundance of\nneutral losses (normalized to the charge-reduced species) follow-\ning ECD of the peptide series AxnYAyK.terminus and the two lysine side-chains, and for triply-charged nYLEFISDAIIHVLHSK they are the N-terminus,\nthe lysine side-chain, and the side-chain of one of the histi-\ndine residues. Hence, the triply-charged species are pre-\ndicted to have more extended conformations than their\ndoubly-charged counterparts. Through-bond electron-\ntransfer rates have been shown to be dependent on\ndistance [50]. Therefore, the current observations could\nbe explained as follows: If electron capture to a high-n\nRydberg state of the central lysine (GPLEnYGFAKG-\nPLAK) or histidine (nYLEFISDAIIHVLHSK) occurs, the\nnitrotyrosine intercepts and traps the electron, whereas\nif the electron is captured to a high-n Rydberg state of\nthe C-terminal lysine (both peptides), relaxation to the\namide \u0002* orbital proceeds with subsequent N\u2013C\u0001 cleav-\nage. It might be expected that if the UW mechanism\nprevails, c\/z-type fragmentation throughout the pep-\ntide, and not simply in the region of the protonation\nsite, would be observed; however it is a requirement of\nthe mechanism that the conformation necessary for\nproton abstraction be achieved and that may not be\npossible for the species studied here.\nWe suggest that providing the peptide is of sufficient\nlength and the charge of the precursor is \b N \u0004 2, where\nN \u0003 number of nitrotyrosines, ECD of nitrated peptides\nand proteins should produce backbone fragments [51].\nConclusion\nIn terms of sequencing and characterization of sites of\nmodification, our results show that ECD is not the\nmethod of choice for doubly-charged nitrotyrosine-\ncontaining peptide ions. Some sequence information\ncan be gleaned following ECD of triply-charged precur-\nsor ions. CID behavior is unaffected by the presence of\ntyrosine nitration. ECD of nitrated peptides is charac-\nterized by loss of small neutrals including \u2022OH, water,\nand ammonia. Losses involving ammonia in isolation\nwere not observed. It is hypothesized that these losses\narise through interactions between protonated lysine\nside-chains and the nitro group, and corroborating\nevidence for this theory is provided by activated ion\nECD, isotopically labeled 15NO2-tyrosine, and a peptide\nseries with variable nitrotyrosine sites.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors acknowledge EPSRC (A.W.J. and H.J.C.), Ramon y\nCajal Programme (CTQ2006-14,959) and Ministerio de Ciencia y\ntecnologia (CTQ2007-62,345), Spain (J.I.), and the Wellcome Trust\n(074131 and 080998) (H.J.C. and V.A.M., respectively) for funding.\nAppendix A\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary material associated with this article\nmay be found in the online version at doi:10.1016\/\nj.jasms.2009.10.011.\n277J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 2010, 21, 268\u2013277 ECD MASS SPECTROMETRY OF TYROSINE NITRATED PEPTIDESReferences\n1.
