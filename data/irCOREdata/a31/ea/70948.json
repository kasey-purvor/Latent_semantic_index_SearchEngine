The inhibitory\neffects are removed by heating the CSF suggesting that the\nactive component(s) is a protein(s).\nThese data led us to the use of a proteomics approach to\ninvestigate the protein profile of CSF and compare this\nbetween normal and affected CSF from fetuses at late\nstages of gestation. We compared CSF collected from the\nlateral ventricles of affected fetuses at E17-E21 to CSF col-\nlected from the cisterna magna of normal animals of the\nsame ages. 2D gel results showed significant differences\nbetween normal and affected CSF at the different ages.\nMALDI-TOF Mass spectroscopy was used to identify some\nof the different proteins and Liquid Chromatography-\nMass Spectroscopy was used to confirm the data.\nInteresting components, such as a reelin precursor, NGF\nprecursor, alpha-feto protein and apolipoprotein where\nfound to change with age and whether collected from nor-\nmal or affected animals. Reelin, NGF and alpha-feto pro-\ntein are all known to have an important role in cortical\ndevelopment. Reelin precursor was present in CSF from\nnormal animals but was absent in H-Tx fetuses aged E21\nand P0 (the day of birth). NGF was present in both animal\ngroups but in reduced amounts in the H-Tx rats on Day\nE21. Alpha-feto protein was present in both and in the\nsame amount. With increasing age the total amount of\nprotein decreases in the CSF of both normal and affected\nfetuses.\nThese findings strengthen the hypothesis that CSF has got\nan important role in normal brain development and in\nthe abnormal development associated with early-onset\nhydrocephalus.\nProteomics provides an important method for the identi-\nfication of CSF proteins particularly where the amount of\nCSF available is small; all other methods require much\nlarger amounts which is a major restriction for the present\nstudy. LC-MS is a new technique that identifies large num-\nbers of proteins in very small samples and this will aid the\nidentification, purification and analysis of candidate pro-\nteins involved in normal and abnormal development.\nfrom 48th Annual Meeting of the Society for Research into Hydrocephalus and Spina Bifida\nDublin, Ireland, 23\u201326 June 2004\nPublished: 23 December 2004\nCerebrospinal Fluid Research 2004, 1(Suppl 1):S29 doi:10.1186\/1743-8454-1-S1-S29\n<supplement> <title> <p>48th Annual Meeting of the Society for Research into Hydrocephalus and Spina Bifida<\/p> <\/title> <note>Meeting abstracts<\/note> <\/supplement>\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.cerebrospinalfluidresearch.com\/content\/1\/S1\/S29\n"}
