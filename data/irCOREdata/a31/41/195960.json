A patrilineal surname is inherited in the same way as \nthe non-recombining region of the Y chromosome, and there should therefore \nbe a correlation between the two. Studies of Y haplotypes within surnames, \nmostly of the British Isles, reveal high levels of coancestry among surname \ncohorts, as well as the influence of confounding factors including multiple \nfounders for names, non-paternities and genetic drift. Combining molecular \ngenetics and surname analysis illuminates population structure and history, \nhas potential applications in forensic studies, and in the form of \u2018genetic \ngenealogy\u2019 is an area of rapidly growing interest for the public. \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n3 \nCultural markers of ancestry \n Before Darwin, humans accorded themselves a special place in the \nkingdom of life. Now, 150 years after the publication of the Origin of Species, \nwe can appreciate that we are part of the continuum of the evolution of all \nspecies, but our unique qualities remain undeniable. Homo sapiens literally \nmeans \u2018knowing man\u2019, but Linnaeus might equally have called us Homo \nnominans - \u2018naming man\u2019 \u2013 because of our capacity for complex language and \nour innate need to apply names to things, and to ourselves. Some of these \nnames are heritable, and are recorded and persist through the generations. So, \nuniquely among organisms, many of us carry a cultural marker of coancestry, \na surname, to go with the biological marker of coancestry common to all \norganisms, DNA. \n In this review we examine the relationship between these two kinds of \ninformation: surnames and DNA. Because most heritable surnames pass from \nfather to son, we focus on the relationships between surnames and paternally \ninherited Y-chromosomal haplotypes. Together with the recent revolution in \nthe power of DNA analysis, the internet has introduced a new dimension in \nthe way that this power can be made easily available to the public, and the \nway that surname information can be shared, exploited and understood. Most \nstudies have focused on surnames in the developed world, and the British \nIsles in particular [1-4], and even reliable data on surname diversity are \ndifficult to come by for many countries. Although this leads to an inevitable \ngeographical and cultural bias, we hope that our description of principles and \ncase studies will help to stimulate studies of a greater diversity of populations \nin the future. \n \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n4 \nHistory, inheritance and diversity of surnames \n In human societies, having a name, and thus being identifiable, is \nessential. The addition of a heritable element facilitates identification, and also \nmarks lineages, providing a label of regional and familial membership. \nAlthough some societies (such as that of Iceland) continue to eschew heritable \nsurnames, governments like them, and in some countries have imposed them \nquite recently. For example, in Turkey all citizens were obliged to adopt a \nheritable surname in 1934, and in Mongolia a compulsory surname law was \nintroduced in 1997. The earliest heritable surnames are those of China, dating \nback ~5000 years; time-depths for other nations vary (Table 1). \nThe diversity of heritable surnames also varies considerably; in China \nit is inconveniently low, as anyone who has carried out a PubMed search for a \nparticular Li (the world\u2019s commonest surname) can testify [5], but in most \ncountries it is amazingly high, with the mean number of bearers of any one \nsurname well below 100 (Table 1). Some populations have high surname \ndiversity because of a long history of admixture - this is certainly true of the \nUSA. The current population of Great Britain has ~1.6 million surnames, but \nthis value is much greater than that in the past, owing to recent immigration \u2013 \nthe number listed in the 1881 census of England and Wales was only some \n420,000. Though the derivations of surnames are often debatable, many fall \ninto a limited number of classes, including patronyms (son of\u2026) and those \nrelated to occupation, status or place-names (Box 1). \n \nPatrilineal surnames and the Y chromosome \nGiven that DNA passes down to us from our ancestors together with \nsurnames, people sharing surnames should have a greater than average \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n5 \nchance of sharing segments of DNA by descent than the general population. \nAlthough most DNA is inherited from both parents there is one segment, the \nnon-recombining region of the Y chromosome, which is only passed down \nfrom father to son [6]. We might therefore expect that a surname should \ncorrelate with a type of Y chromosome, inherited from a shared paternal \nancestor \u2013 perhaps the surname\u2019s original founder. A plethora of polymorphic \nDNA markers for distinguishing between Y chromosomes allows this idea to \nbe tested; the types of marker and their properties are described in Box 2. \nThe simple expectation of a correlation between Y chromosome type \nand surname is complicated by several confounding factors. Some surnames \nare likely to have been founded independently more than once (Figure 1); this \nwill result in more than one Y type being associated with a given surname. \nNon-paternity events, the adoption of male children and deliberate surname \nchange will have the same consequence (Figure 1). \nMutation also acts to diversify the Y chromosome types associated \nwith a particular surname, but, unlike the factors described above, its impact \nis relatively predictable. The mutation rates of single nucleotide \npolymorphisms (SNP) are low, so within the time-depths of surnames in most \npopulations (~500-1000 years in most European populations) the widely \ntyped SNPs are not expected to undergo mutations. By contrast, short tandem \nrepeats (STRs) mutate rapidly, so mutations are relatively likely to be \nobserved \u2013 indeed, our knowledge of their rates comes from identifying \nmutations within pedigrees [7] and father\u2013son pairs [8]. The probability of \ndetecting mutations within lineages depends on the number of STRs \nanalysed, and also their individual properties.  \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n6 \nGenetic drift \u2013 the random changes in haplotype frequencies over the \ngenerations \u2013 is the final factor that acts against the influences described \nabove by reducing the diversity of haplotypes within surnames. For example, \nthe stochastic variation in the number of sons fathered by different men can, \nover many generations, lead to the extinction of some Y chromosome lineages \nand the increase in the frequency of others within surname cohorts. Indeed, \ngenetic drift (known in genealogical circles as \u2018daughtering out\u2019) is \nresponsible for the complete extinction of some British surnames (such as \nCampinot) that had persisted for many generations [9]. \n \nY chromosome diversity within surnames of the British Isles \n Most detailed studies have focused on surnames of the British Isles. \nThe pioneering and eponymous study of the surname Sykes [4] indicated low \nY haplotype diversity among unrelated carriers of the name, suggesting that \nthis was compatible with a single founder. However, its haplotype resolution \n(4 Y-STRs) was low. \n The availability of more STRs and haplogroup-defining SNPs (Box 2) \nhas allowed higher-resolution studies to be performed. A general link \nbetween surnames and Y-haplotypes was revealed in a study of 150 pairs of \nrandomly ascertained men, each sharing a different British surname [1]. \nSixteen of the 150 pairs shared identical 17-STR haplotypes, and 20 more pairs \nshared sufficiently similar haplotypes to suggest coancestry within the past \n700 years \u2013 the average time since British surnames were established. Overall, \nthe link is stronger the rarer the surname, with all pairs that show a strong \nsignal of coancestry being found among the less common surnames (<5 600 \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n7 \nbearers); this suggests that the commoner surnames had relatively large \nnumbers of founders. \n Two studies, in Britain [2] and Ireland [3], have collected and analysed \nlarger groups of men with fewer surnames, using the same set of 17 Y-STRs, \nplus a number of haplogroup-defining SNPs. Both studies used networks to \ndisplay and analyse diversity, with different approaches to defining \u2018descent \nclusters\u2019 of related haplotypes (Box 2). Both also estimated the time to most \nrecent common ancestor (TMRCA) for clusters, finding ages compatible with \nthe known time-depths of surname establishment. British control males \ncarrying different surnames show very little haplotype sharing (Figure 2a), \nand the same is true of men carrying the commonest surname, Smith (Figure \n2b). However, less common names show decreasing haplogroup diversity, \nand increasing degrees of STR haplotype sharing (Figure 2c,d): rare names \n(such as Attenborough) can be dominated by a single descent cluster (Figure \n2d), which might indicate a single founder. However, the shallow time depth \nof many clusters within names, the absence of an effect of surname type on \ndiversity, and computer simulations, together suggest a strong influence of \ngenetic drift, such that current diversity is a poor reflection of the initial \nfounder number [2].  \n  Irish Y chromosomes show much lower haplogroup diversity than \nthose of Britain, ~90% belonging to a single haplogroup, so most information \nis provided by Y-STRs [3]. Based on the same set of 17 STR markers [2], Irish \ncontrols carrying different surnames (like British ones) show very few shared \nhaplotypes. However, within surname cohorts descent clusters are again \nevident, with an average of 61% of haplotypes within a surname lying in \ndescent clusters \u2013 a very similar value to the British proportion of 62% [2]. \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n8 \nMost of the variation between names was attributed to differences in founder \nnumbers. \n Comparison of the two studies reveals a striking difference between \nthese neighbouring islands: the surname frequency-dependence of coancestry \nproportions evident in British names is absent from Ireland [2]. Some \ncommon Irish names such as Ryan (Figure 2e), borne by as much as 1% of the \npopulation, are dominated by single descent clusters, and, unlike in Britain, \nthere is no significant correlation between a surname\u2019s rarity and the diversity \nof the Y chromosomes within it. The difference could be due to an \namplification of genetic drift in Ireland, as a result of the prevalence of \nmedieval patrilineal dynasties that linked male social and reproductive \nsuccess in the past (discussed further below), but could also reflect other \ndemographic historical differences, such as greater urbanisation in Britain and \ndifferent impacts of epidemic disease. \n These studies also highlight several factors that should be considered \nwhen systematic surname studies are carried out in other populations: (i) \nSampling strategy needs to be planned carefully to avoid sampling related \nindividuals; (ii) Geographical structure could affect diversity within sampled \nsurnames, and its extent needs to be assessed [3]; (iii) Use of a standard set of \nY-STRs would facilitate comparisons between studies, and, because of their \nconvenience and high resolution, the commercially available profiling kits \nsuch as Y-filer (ABI) seem appropriate; (iv) The criteria for membership of \ndescent clusters need careful consideration, since the boundary of a cluster is \noften not obvious. Our recommendation is to type binary markers as well as \nSTRs, which will allow the definition of clusters within haplogroups that are \nrare in the population, and which therefore have relatively clear boundaries \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n9 \n[2]. The observed pattern of STR divergence within such clusters can be used \nto define a set of rules for cluster definition that can be more generally \napplied to common haplogroups. In some populations (e.g. Ireland) \nhaplogroup diversity is currently inconveniently low for this approach [3], \nbut new marker discovery should soon alleviate this problem; (v) Deduction \nof relevant generation times [10], perhaps from genealogical research in the \npopulations under study, would aid in the accuracy of dating; (vi) \nStandardisation of Y-STR mutation rates would help in the estimation of \nTMRCAs across studies. The mutation rate derived from direct observation in \nfather-son pairs (the \u2018pedigree rate\u2019; ~2 x 10-3 per STR per generation [8]) is \nabout three-fold greater than that derived from consideration of accumulated \ndiversity within populations (the \u2018evolutionary rate\u2019 [11]), and studies have \ndiffered in which of these they apply leading to challenges in comparing \nstudies [2, 3].  \n \nApplications of surname studies \n The first application of surnames in genetics was in \u2018isonymy\u2019 studies, \na field originated by Charles Darwin\u2019s son George, where they were used to \nestimate the degree of inbreeding in populations, based on the frequency of \nsame-surname marriages [12], or on surname frequencies alone [13]. The \nunderlying assumption, that a shared surname implies shared ancestry, has \nnot been tested in most of the surveyed populations, and, as our previous \ndiscussion indicates, is often likely to be incorrect [14]. Despite such \nobjections, the field of isonymy studies remains active; for a review, see Ref. \n15.  \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n10 \nHere we focus on three areas in which surname information has been \ncombined with molecular genetic analysis to yield new insights. \n \nPast population structure and history \nSurnames tend to be specific to particular indigenous populations, and \nto show geographical specificity within regions. This property means that \nthey find wide application as convenient proxies for ethnic origin [16] in \nhealth-care [17], epidemiological studies [18] and directed marketing [19]. \nHowever, combining surnames with Y-chromosome analysis has also allowed \nthem to be used in genetic studies of historical migrations and admixture. \nMuch of this work has been carried out in the Irish population. For \nexample, removal of individuals with non-Gaelic surnames in an analysis of \nIrish Y chromosomes leads to a significant change in haplogroup frequencies \n[20], and likely access to a more \u2018indigenous\u2019 sample and its population \nstructure. A further link with the distant past is suggested by a common \nhaplotype [21], interpreted to reflect the demographic impact of a medieval \npatrilineal dynasty, the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. This 17-STR haplotype accounts for ~17% of \nY chromosomes in the northwest of Ireland and is proposed to be the Y-\nlineage of a 5th century warlord, Niall of the Nine Hostages. This \ninterpretation is supported by the over-representation of a descent cluster \ncentred on the haplotype in 25 Irish surnames thought to originate in the U\u00ed \nN\u00e9ill dynasty. \nThe high reproductive success of this lineage seems to provide support \nfor the idea of an amplification of genetic drift through social selection in the \nhistory of Ireland, adduced above to explain differences in haplotype \ndiversity between Irish and British surnames. However, studies of multiple \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n11 \nsurname groups thought to descend from two other patrilineal clans \n(E\u00f3ganacht and D\u00e1l Cais) show much less evidence of coancestry within either \nclan [22] and this suggests either that not all clans were really established by \neponymous founders, or that in these cases the link between modern \nsurnames and early origins has been severed. A broken link might also be \nsuggested by an analysis of males with names of Norse Viking derivation (e.g. \nThunder, Doyle and Hanrick), which reveals no difference from a general Irish \nsample [23], although this could also simply indicate that the Norse \ncontribution in the Viking period (800-1200 CE) was very low. \nThe geographical differentiation of Y haplotypes is particularly marked \nin intercontinental comparisons. An association of a clearly African Y lineage \nwith a rare English surname [24] provides evidence of a past African presence \nin Britain, and genealogical research connecting men carrying the surname \nand the exotic chromosome together allow a lower limit to be placed on its \ntime-depth, during the mid-eighteenth century. In a different geographical \ncontext, observation of the low diversity of Y haplotypes in surname groups \nin Colombia demonstrates the powerful male-specific founder effects caused \nby Spanish and Portuguese colonisation [25]. \nMost population studies of Y-chromosome diversity categorise donors \ninto local sub-populations on the basis of at least two generations of \nresidence. However, this is compromised by migration in preceding \ngenerations. The geographical specificity of surnames suggests surname-\nbased sampling as a means to choose modern Y chromosomes in a way that \nreflects their past population distributions [26]. This was done in a study of \nthe Viking contributions to the Wirral peninsula and West Lancashire, in \nnorthwest England [27]. Historical and other evidence suggests colonisation \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n12 \nby Norse Vikings, beginning in 902 CE. Independent samples were recruited \nfor each place: the \u2018modern\u2019 sample, based simply on two-generations of \nresidence; and the \u2018medieval\u2019 sample, based on a history of residence plus the \npossession of a surname known from documentary evidence to have been \npresent in the region prior to 1572 CE. The distributions of Y haplotypes in \nthe two sample types were significantly different, and this could be accounted \nfor by a greater Norse contribution to the \u2018medieval\u2019 samples, as judged by \nadmixture analysis. This supports the idea that surname-based ascertainment \nprovides a sample that more closely reflects past populations, prior to \nimmigration from elsewhere.  \n Several studies of surnames and Y-haplotypes have used the diversity \npresent within surnames to make inferences about the past rates of non-\npaternity [2-4, 25]. The assumptions and methods vary, but there is agreement \nthat rates are <5% per generation, and in some cases <1% [25]. These rates are \ntherefore consistent with modern estimates where there is no prior suspicion \nof non-paternity [28], and contradict the oft-quoted \u2018urban mythical\u2019 figure of \n10% per generation. \n \nForensic application \nThe link between surname and Y-chromosomal haplotype suggests the \nidea of predicting a surname in forensic investigations [29]. In a case where an \nautosomal DNA profile yields no matches in a DNA database, a list of \nsurnames with associated Y-STR haplotypes could allow a Y-profile to be \nmatched with one or more surnames. This would provide a means to \nprioritise a suspect list; the surname prediction would act only as an \ninvestigative tool, since autosomal profiling could be used to exclude or \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n13 \nmatch individuals once they were identified. The validity of this approach has \nbeen confirmed in principle [1], but has yet to be used in practice; it might be \ncompromised in the mixed and urban populations commonly encountered in \ncriminal investigations. The link between surname and Y-haplotype is weak \nfor common names (Figure 2), and including all rare ones is impractical, so the \napproach would be most useful for intermediate frequency surnames. In \nsome cases, sharing of common haplotypes across surnames could result in \nmany surnames being returned. In a sample of 1814 men carrying 164 names \nthe commonest 17-STR haplotype was shared across 16 different surnames \n[30]. \nWhile surname prediction might have useful forensic applications, it \nalso has the potential to infringe the privacy of those contributing DNA \nanonymously for medical research. For example, the surnames of the donors \nof the European members of the HapMap [31] DNA collection could be \nguessed at using published genotyping data and public databases of names \nand haplotypes [32]. In a highly publicised case, a 15-year old boy conceived \nby anonymous sperm donation traced his biological father by surname \nprediction through testing of his own Y chromosome, and exploiting public \ndatabases together with information on the father\u2019s date and place of birth \n[33]. \n \nGenetic genealogy and the rise of recreational genetics \n Without doubt the most active area of exploitation of the link between \nsurnames and Y-haplotypes is in the area of genetic genealogy, driven by the \nmassive popular interest in family history, the availability of commercial \nDNA testing, and the ease of communication afforded by the internet. Many \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n14 \ncompanies offer Y-chromosome analysis, which is done using DNA extracted \nfrom buccal samples received from customers by post. More broadly, genetic \ngenealogy forms part of \u2018recreational genetics\u2019, which includes the use of \ngenome-wide markers to assess personal ancestry, relatedness and disease \nsusceptibility, and this growing activity is also providing useful information \nfor surname studies. \n Directed commercial Y testing is usually seen as an adjunct to the \ntraditional methods of genealogical research [34], and can, for example, show \nthat two men with the same surname share a haplotype and therefore a recent \ncommon ancestor [35, 36]. Estimates of the time during which that ancestor \nlived [37] might also be offered, subject to considerable uncertainty. More \ngenerally, a group of men sharing a surname can collaborate to have their Y \nchromosomes analyzed, which can lead to the refinement of family trees, or \nthe inclusion or rejection of branches for further genealogical investigation. \nThousands of such \u2018surname projects\u2019 are currently in existence (Box 3). The \nsize of Y-chromosome\/surname datasets, often made freely available online \nby customers, is large (Table 2), and despite the possibly biased ascertainment \nof samples these represent a very useful general resource, and give \nopportunities for collaboration between the academic and amateur \ncommunities. One recent example is the characterisation of a set of novel \nSNPs within the generally rare hg G, which was facilitated by the easy \nidentification and recruitment of DNA donors carrying hg G chromosomes \nvia public genetic genealogy databases [38]. \n The interpretation of the relationships among customers\u2019 Y haplotypes \ndepends on the haplotype resolution. Though some companies offer Y-SNP \nanalysis, most offer only Y-STR typing, since this is highly discriminating and \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n15 \nuniversally applicable; the number of STRs typed varies from 15 to 67. \nNotably, 67 STRs is far more than are analysed in most academic studies, \nwhich are generally restricted by budgetary considerations to 20 or fewer. \nGenerally speaking, the more markers typed the better (aside from the \nincreasing probability of typing errors), since this reduces ambiguity in the \ninterpretation of shared haplotypes. However, as the number of STRs \nincreases so, too, does the probability of detecting an STR mutation between \nclose relatives [29], and this needs to be taken into account. \nCompanies offering broader recreational genetics services use \nmicroarray-based methods to type up to ~1 million SNPs genome-wide, and \nreturn information to customers. The relevance for surname studies is that a \nproportion of the SNPs typed in these analyses are annotated as Y-linked (for \nexample, 858 SNPs on the commercially typed Illumina 1M chip) and so they \nprovide potential information about Y lineages. However, the SNP validation \nstatus and the correspondence with well-studied Y-SNPs [39] is in many cases \nunclear, and this is being resolved through the sharing of genotypic data from \nSNP chips among genetic genealogists [40, 41]. For example, haplogroup \nR1b1b2 is the commonest Y-lineage in western Europe, reaching over 90% in \nIreland, and it has been difficult to find SNPs to subdivide it for population \nstudies. The SNP rs34276300, known as S116, has been identified through \ncomparing SNP chip results as a useful marker to subdivide hg R1b1b2, and is \nnow being incorporated into academic studies. This is an area in which closer \ncollaborations between amateurs and academics could prove particularly \nuseful. \nMembers of the amateur community often display an impressive level \nof knowledge about aspects of molecular evolution, population genetics and \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n16 \nstatistics; some of this is evinced in the quarterly online Journal of Genetic \nGenealogy (www.jogg.info). While it lacks the standard scientific peer-review \nsystem of traditional journals, it is nonetheless attracting academic geneticists \namong its authors, and is an interesting model for public involvement in \nscientific publication. Other resources for genetic genealogy are listed in Box \n3. Thanks to the advances in DNA technology and the power of the internet, \ngenetics is now joining astronomy as a science in which amateurs can make \nuseful discoveries. \nGenetic genealogy is fun, fascinating, and has much to contribute to \nacademic science, but does it have any drawbacks? One obvious problem is \nthe danger of detecting unexpected past non-paternities, or of having \ncherished oral histories disproven, both of which happened in the case of a \nfamily who believed themselves to be descendants of President Thomas \nJefferson [42]. Although the Y chromosome is notoriously lacking in robust \ndisease associations [6], some interstitial Y-chromosomal deletions (with \nincidences up to ~1 in 4000 males [43]) are certainly associated with male \ninfertility [44], and can be signalled by the absence of specific Y-STRs and \nSNPs [45]. Beyond the genealogical aspects, the assignment of Y-lineages to \nparticular geographical origins or ethnic groups can be misleading [46, 47]. \nNone of these potential pitfalls seem likely to put off the customers of DNA \ntyping companies, however. \n \nFuture developments \n Sampling of a wider variety of populations and their surnames will \nhelp to alleviate the current geographical bias, and should lead to interesting \nnew insights about social and demographic history. However, most new \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n17 \nadvances will arise from exploitation of recent technological developments. \nImprovements to the methods of analysis of ancient DNA should allow the \ntesting of genealogical links between living individuals and putative \npatrilineal ancestors, and also among archaeological human remains [48, 49]. \nHigh-resolution Y-typing and mitochondrial DNA sequencing together with \nwhole-genome SNP analysis should allow reliable reconstructions of \ngenealogies de novo, at least for the past few generations; this will include the \nestablishment of links across the sexes, which cannot be achieved by the \nanalysis of uniparentally inherited markers alone. In terms of relatedness, \nsurname-ascertained cohorts of men who share Y-chromosomal coancestry lie \nbetween the traditional pedigree and the population, and application of \nwhole-genome typing to such groups could be useful in understanding the \nhistory of recombination [50], and for genetic epidemiological purposes. \n Recent application of conventional and \u2018next-generation\u2019 sequencing \n[51] technologies has revealed a large number of putative Y-SNPs in two \nnamed individuals, Craig Venter [52] and James Watson [53]. Such \u2018celebrity \ngenomics\u2019 [54] projects will add further famous names to the webpages of \ngenealogical geneticists, to join the motley crew of Genghis Khan, Thomas \nJefferson, Marie Antoinette, Jesse James et al. \n(www.isogg.org\/famousdna.htm). As the cost of sequencing continues to fall, \nprivate individuals will fund their own genome projects, and it seems \ninevitable that SNPs will be identified that are specific to particular surnames \nor their branches, providing powerful resources for genealogical research. \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n18 \nAcknowledgements \n Our work is supported by the Wellcome Trust, including a Senior \nResearch Fellowship in Basic Biomedical Science (grant number 057559) to \nMAJ.

Subsequently \nfurther diversity was introduced by non-paternity events, adoptions or \nsurname changes (shown by stars, and the different haplogroup colours) or \nSTR mutations (different shades of haplogroup colours). Diversity was \nreduced by genetic drift: all current hg T chromosomes within the surname \ndescend from the original founder, whereas all current hg R1a chromosomes \nhave a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) only 9 generations ago. In each \ncase, white dots and bold lines indicate genealogical connections between \ncurrent chromosomes and their MRCA. Current haplogroup diversity within \nthe surname is very different from that in the general population [2] (pie \ncharts to right, with sectors proportional to haplogroup frequency); in \nparticular, hg T is not found in the general population sample, but represents \n35% of the chromosomes in the surname sample. \n \nFigure 2: Reduced Y chromosome diversity within surname groups. \nDiversity of Y chromosome haplotypes among control males and five \nsurname groups is represented by median joining networks.

Here are some genetically relevant examples (British unless \notherwise specified): \n\u2022 Patronyms (\u2018son of\u2026\u2019): Bateson, Jeffreys, Watson \n\u2022 Clan or group membership: Haldane (\u2018half-Dane\u2019); McKusick (Irish - \n\u2018descendant of Isaac\u2019), Wallace (\u2018a Celt\u2019) \n\u2022 Occupations or status: Fisher (fisherman), Wright (maker of \nmachinery\/objects), Franklin (feudal status term), Chakraborty (Indian \u2013 local \nlandlord), M\u00fcller (German \u2013 miller) \n\u2022 Specific places: Charlesworth (Derbyshire, England), Darlington (Co. \nDurham, England), Crick (Northamptonshire, England), Pontecorvo (near \nRome, Italy), Tsui (ancient state of Xu, China) \n\u2022 Landscape features: Bridges, Ford (river crossing), Southern, Suzuki (Japanese \n\u2013 pampas grass) \n\u2022 Nicknames or characteristics: Darwin (\u2018dear friend\u2019), Hodgkin (pet form of \nRoger), Sturtevant (\u2018hasty individual\u2019), Klug (German \u2013 \u2018wise, prudent\u2019), Ochoa \n(Basque \u2013 from otxoa, \u2018wolf\u2019) \n Many surnames have one or more spelling variants; these were \ngenerally fixed relatively recently, when spellings were formalised [2, 57]. \n In Iceland, surnames are not heritable, but patronymic: the surnames of \na son or daughter of the father Stef\u00e1n, for example, will be Stef\u00e1nsson and \nStef\u00e1nsdottir, and in the next generation the surnames will change again. \nMany heritable surnames in other countries have evolved from previously \nnon-heritable patronymic systems. \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n22 \n \nBox 2: Markers for Y-chromosome diversity \nTwo types of polymorphic marker are commonly used to distinguish Y \nchromosomes from one another [6]. Binary markers such as single nucleotide \npolymorphisms (SNPs) have low mutation rates, typically ~10-8 per base per \ngeneration [58], and mostly represent unique events in human evolution. \nShort tandem repeats (STRs) are multiallelic markers, new alleles arising \nlargely by single-step mutation at a typical rate of ~10-3 per STR per \ngeneration [8]. \n \nBinary markers are used in combination to define monophyletic haplotypes \n(\u2018haplogroups\u2019), which are arranged into a maximum parsimony tree [39, 59] \ncontaining major clades labelled A through T (Figure Ia). Each clade is further \nsubdivided into alphanumerically named subclades (Figure Ib), the whole tree \ncurrently comprising 586 markers defining 311 haplogroups [39]. Application \nof new sequencing technologies (www.1000genomes.org) will yield \nthousands of new markers, and serious nomenclature problems, since the \ncurrent system will become impossibly unwieldy. Some haplogroups are \nfrequent in particular populations, and therefore provide relatively little \ndiscriminatory power. \n \nThe majority of widely used Y-STR markers are tri- and tetranucleotide \nrepeats, of which there are >200 on the chromosome [60]. Combinations of Y-\nSTRs (typed in PCR multiplexes) define more informative haplotypes within \nthe haplogroups. Relationships among Y-STR haplotypes are often displayed \nin median-joining networks [61] (Figure Ic), which can also incorporate \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n23 \nhaplogroup information. Closely related sets of haplotypes (typically found \nwithin surnames) define \u2018descent clusters\u2019, and, given an estimate of average \nSTR mutation rates, time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for a \ncluster can be estimated [62].  \n \nTyping an STR multiplex is a highly efficient way both to distinguish between \nY chromosomes and to indicate haplotype relationships, and can even be used \nto predict a haplogroup [63]. Each new haplogroup-defining SNP arose on a \nsingle chromosome, carrying a single Y-STR haplotype. Over time, mutation \nled to a limited repertoire of variation among the Y-STR haplotypes within \nthis haplogroup, deriving from the founding haplotype [64]. The power of \nhaplogroup prediction depends on the number of STRs typed, and, in some \ncases, specific diagnostic STR alleles. Distinguishing between closely related \nhaplogroups is usually difficult, and, indeed, they may share identical Y-STR \nhaplotypes, even when many STRs are typed. In such cases, SNP typing is \nessential. \n \nFigure legend for Box 2: \nFigure I: Y-chromosomal markers. \na) Phylogeny showing major haplogroups (A-T) defined by binary \nmarkers [39]. \nb) Detailed phylogeny of haplogroup I, showing SNPs on branches (not \nall are included) and alphanumeric names of sub-haplogroups [39]. \nc) Median-joining network of Y-STR haplotypes within a surname, \nindicating labelling conventions and examples of descent clusters (after \n[2]) \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n24 \nBox 3: Resources for genetic genealogy studies \nAside from the Y-haplotype databases listed in Table 2, there are many \nuseful resources for those interested in surnames and genetics, for example: \n\u2022 The International Society of Genetic Genealogy (www.isogg.org) \nadvocates the use of genetics as a tool for genealogical research, and provides \na support network for genetic genealogists. It hosts the ISOGG Y-haplogroup \ntree, which has the virtue of being regularly updated. \n\u2022 The Journal of Genetic Genealogy (www.jogg.info \u2013 and see text) publishes \narticles on individual surname studies, new methods of analysis, insights into \nmutation rates, geographic patterns in genetic data, and information that \nhelps to characterise haplogroups. \n\u2022 The Guild of One-Name Studies (www.one-name.org) exchanges and \npublishes information about one-name studies based on traditional historical \nand genealogical research, and including DNA information. \n\u2022 Some DNA typing companies, including Family Tree DNA \n(www.familytreedna.com) and DNA Heritage (www.dnaheritage.com), host \nmany \u2018surname projects\u2019. \n\u2022 Wikipedia\u2019s pages on Y haplogroups (en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Human_Y-\nchromosome_DNA_haplogroups) provide up-to-date information on specific \nY lineages, and useful information on particular SNPs can be found in the \nwiki-based SNPedia (www.snpedia.com). Details of Y-STRs and useful links \nare in STRBase (www.cstl.nist.gov\/biotech\/strbase\/y_strs.htm). \n\u2022 Information on how DNA information can be used in studying surnames \ncan be found in popular books, including Smolenyak & Turner\u2019s Trace your \nroots with DNA [65] and Fitzpatrick\u2019s DNA & genealogy [66] \n \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n25 \nTable 1: Surname statistics for selected countries and populations. \nCountry or \npopulation \n(% of total \nsurveyed) \nMean \nno. of \ncarriers \/ \nsurname \nMost \nfrequent \nsurname \n% \ncarrying \nmost \nfrequent \nsurname \n% \ncarrying \n10 most \nfrequent \nsurnames \nHereditary \nsurname \ntime-depth \n(years) \nRef. \nGreat \nBritain (75) \n28 Smith 1.22 5.9 ~700 \n(England); \n~300 \n(Wales) \n[57, 67] \nIreland (69) 63 Murphy 1.71 10.5 ~900 [67, 68] \nNetherlands \n(28) \n9 De Jong 0.54 3.7 ~200 [26, 67] \nGermany \n(35) \n23 M\u00fcller 0.89 3.9 ~700 [67, 69] \nNorway \n(74) \n29 Hansen 1.41 9.3 ~100 (most \nof rural \npopulation) \n[67, 70] \nFrance (32) 17 Martin 0.33 1.6 ~500  [67, 71] \nSpain (21) 37 Garcia 3.66 19.8 ~500 [67, 69] \nItaly (27) 12 Rossi 0.33 1.5 ~600 [67, 69] \nIndia (0.3) 19 Sharma 2.44 12.8 complex \nhistory \n[67] \nJapan (35) 904 Sato 1.44 10.4 ~800 \n(governing \nclasses); \n~150 \n(majority) \n[67, 72] \nChina (22) 72195 Li 7.4 >30 ~5000 [73] \nAustralia \n(37) \n630 Smith 1.23 5.4 Most \nnames \nimported \nfrom \nelsewhere \n[67] \nUSA (23) 43 Smith 0.9 4.8 Most \nnames \nimported \nfrom \nelsewhere \n[67] \nCanada (13) 17 Smith 0.31 2.0 Most \nnames \nimported \nfrom \nelsewhere \n[67] \nTristan da \nCunha (100) \n40 Green 0.23 100 Names \nimported \nfrom \nelsewhere  \n[74] \nLancaster \nCounty \nAmish (nk) \na Stoltzfus 26 82 Names \nimported \nfrom \nelsewhere  \n[75] \na : 27 names in 5,538 households \n \nAuthors\u2019 revised personal version; published in Trends Genet. 25, 351-360; http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2009.06.003  \n26 \n Table 2: Publicly available Y haplotype databases. \n \nHaplotype database Description Markers Database \nsize (no. of \nhaplotypes) \nYbase (ybase.org) Maintained by testing company (DNA \nHeritage); users can add their own \ndata.
