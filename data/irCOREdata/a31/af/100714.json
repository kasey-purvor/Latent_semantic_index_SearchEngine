These\ninvolve reactions of nuclei far from stability, the most\nexotic of which are often very weakly bound. Breakup of\nweakly bound nuclei is thus an important process in their\ncollisions with other nuclei. A major consequence of\nbreakup is that not all the resulting breakup fragments\nmight be captured by the target, termed incomplete fusion\n(ICF); capture of the entire projectile by the target is called\ncomplete fusion (CF). Such ICF processes can dramati-\ncally change the nature of the reaction products, as has\nbeen investigated in detail for the stable weakly bound\nnuclei 9Be and 6;7Li [1]. There, at energies above the fusion\nbarrier, CF yields were found to be only \u00012=3 of those\nexpected, the remaining 1=3 being in ICF products. Events\nwhere the projectile breaks up and none of the fragments\nare captured provide an important diagnostic of the reac-\ntion dynamics. This we call no-capture breakup (NCBU),\nalso referred to as elastic breakup.\nIn a conventional picture of fusion, two colliding nuclei\nwill fuse if they overcome the potential barrier due to their\nmutual Coulomb and nuclear interactions. The additional\nbreakup degrees of freedom when one of the colliding\nnuclei is weakly bound makes the process very much\nmore complicated. An outstanding theoretical challenge\nis to model the CF and ICF processes in such collisions,\nsince this separation is crucial to understand the effects of\nbreakup on fusion [1,2]. Quantum mechanical few-body\napproaches, such as the continuum discretized coupled-\nchannel (CDCC) method [3,4] and the time-dependent\nwave packet method [5], cannot separate incomplete and\ncomplete fusion contributions to their absorptive cross\nsections [6], since both result in depletion of the total\nfew-body wave function. The CDCC method can, however,\nmake reliable predictions of the NCBU process [7], as will\nbe exploited here. What, then, are the alternatives to the\nabove models? A novel optical decoherence model has\nbeen suggested [6] but has yet to be implemented.\nAnother approach is to use the concept of classical trajec-\ntories which allow CF and ICF events to be separated, as in\nthe two-dimensional model of Ref. [8]. Classical dynami-\ncal models are also being successfully applied to describe\natomic many-body collisions, including ionization [9], a\nprocess in some ways analogous to breakup.\nIn this Letter we present a new three-dimensional clas-\nsical dynamical reaction model that allows quantitative\ncalculations of CF and ICF yields above the barrier. This\nis achieved by the introduction of a stochastically sampled\nbreakup function. Crucially, this function can be deter-\nmined from experimental sub-barrier breakup data [10]\nor from CDCC calculations. We apply the model to two-\nbody projectiles, although it can be extended to more\ncomplex many-body breakup scenarios. As individual tra-\njectories are followed, the model allows a clear identifica-\ntion of CF, ICF, and NCBU events, allowing predictions of\ntheir yields as well as breakup fragment angular, kinetic\nenergy, and relative energy distributions. This unique ca-\npability provides a powerful tool for interpreting future\nfusion experiments with radioactive nuclei and in applica-\ntions to \u0001 ray spectroscopy [11]. The model is assessed\nquantitatively by comparing its predictions for NCBU ob-\nservables with those of fully quantum mechanical CDCC\ncalculations. These are carried out for a simplified test\ncase. The classical model CF and ICF predictions are\nthen compared to experimental data.\nThe classical model calculations are as follows. The\nweakly bound (two-body) projectile P, with incident en-\nergy E0 and orbital angular momentum L0, is incident on\nthe target T, initially at rest in the laboratory frame. Prior to\nbreakup the projectile follows a classical orbit with a P-T\ndistance of closest approach Rmin\u0002E0; L0\u0003. These orbits of\nthe bound projectile are calculated by numerical solution\nof the classical equations of motion in the presence of the\nPRL 98, 152701 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending13 APRIL 2007\n0031-9007=07=98(15)=152701(4) 152701-1 \u00a9 2007 The American Physical Society\nCoulomb and nuclear potentials between P and T. These\ngenerate a Coulomb barrier for head-on (L0 \u0004 0) colli-\nsions of height VPTB at a separation RPTB .\nThe effects of the Coulomb and nuclear two-body inter-\nactions that cause breakup are encoded in a local breakup\nprobability P LBU\u0002R\u0003, a function of the projectile-target\nseparation R, such that P LBU\u0002R\u0003dR is the probability of\nbreakup on the interval R to R\u0005 dR. Crucially, for a given\nprojectile-target combination, both experimental data [10]\nand CDCC calculations indicate that the integral of this\nbreakup probability along a given classical orbit is an\nexponential function of its distance of closest approach,\nRmin\u0002E0; L0\u0003. Explicitly,\n PBU\u0002Rmin\u0003 \u0004 2\nZ 1\nRmin\nP LBU\u0002R\u0003dR \u0004 A exp\u0002\u0006\u0002Rmin\u0003; (1)\nfrom which it follows uniquely that the local function has\nthe same exponential form, P LBU\u0002R\u0003 \/ exp\u0002\u0006\u0002R\u0003.\nFor each L0 (chosen to be an integer number of @) a\nsample of N incident projectiles is taken. The position of\nbreakup on this orbit is determined by sampling a breakup\nradius RBU on the interval [Rmin\u0002E0; L0\u0003;1] with the\nweighting P LBU\u0002R\u0003. Although dependent on the constants\nA and \u0002, the exponential weighting of P LBU\u0002R\u0003 will clearly\nplace most RBU in the vicinity of Rmin. If the chosen L0 is\nless than the critical partial wave for projectile fusion, Lcr,\nthen the associated trajectory would normally lead to CF,\ni.e., Rmin \u0007 RPTB . For these L0 we set Rmin \u0004 RPTB , when\nsampling RBU, and all breakup events are confined to the\nincoming branch of the projectile trajectory. For L0 > Lcr\nbreakup can take place on both the entrance and the exit\nbranches of the classical orbit, which are sampled equally.\nHaving chosen the position with the projectile center of\nmass at breakup, it is instantaneously broken up into frag-\nments F1 and F2.\nFollowing breakup, fragments F1 and F2 now interact\nwith T and with each other via real central two-body\npotentials having Coulomb barriers VijB at separations R\nij\nB ,\ni, j \u0004 1, 2, T, i \u0001 j. The instantaneous dynamical varia-\nbles of the excited projectile at breakup, its total internal\nenergy \"12, angular momentum ~\u201812, and the separation of\nthe fragments ~d12 are all Monte Carlo sampled. The initial\nseparations d12 between the fragments are Gaussian dis-\ntributed in their classically allowed region to mimic the\nradial probability distribution of the projectile ground-state\n(GS) wave function. For high \u201812 excitations, when there is\nno barrier between F1 and F2, d12 is equated with their\nexternal turning point. In the test calculation below, the\norientation of ~d12 is chosen randomly over the 4\u0003 solid\nangle, while the orientation of ~\u201812 is chosen randomly from\nall directions orthogonal to ~d12. Other distributions could\neasily be encoded in cases where the two breakup frag-\nments are not identical. \u201812 is sampled uniformly on the\ninterval [0,\u2018max]. For \"12 we tested two sampling functions\nfor energies between the top of the barrier, V12B , and a\nchosen maximum \"max. Using uniform weighting or an\nexponentially decreasing weighting yielded very similar\noutcomes, although the convergence of the observables\nwas faster for the latter, which was therefore used. Both\n\u2018max and \"max were increased until convergence of the\nobservables occurred, as in the CDCC calculations.\nHaving fixed the positions and dynamical variables of\nthe excited projectile fragments at the moment of breakup,\nthe instantaneous velocities of the particles F1, F2, and T\nare dictated by conservation of energy, linear momentum,\nand angular momentum in the overall center of mass frame\nof the projectile and target system. These breakup initial\nconditions were transformed to the laboratory frame where\nthe equations of motion are solved. The computed trajec-\ntories of F1, F2, and T determine the number of ICF, CF,\nand NCBU events, fragment Fj being assumed to be\ncaptured if the classical trajectories take it within the\nfragment-target barrier radius RjTB .\nFrom the N breakup events sampled for each projectile\nangular momentum L0, the numbers of events Ni in which\ni \u0004 0 (NCBU), 1 (ICF), or 2 (CF) fragments are captured\ndetermine the relative yields ~Pi \u0004 Ni=N of these three\nprocesses after breakup, with ~P0 \u0005 ~P1 \u0005 ~P2 \u0004 1. The ab-\nsolute probabilities Pi\u0002E0; L0\u0003 of the three reaction pro-\ncesses are determined from the relative yields and the\nintegrated breakup probability over the whole trajectory\nPBU\u0002Rmin\u0003:\n P0\u0002E0; L0\u0003 \u0004 PBU\u0002Rmin\u0003 ~P0; (2)\n P1\u0002E0; L0\u0003 \u0004 PBU\u0002Rmin\u0003 ~P1; (3)\n P2\u0002E0; L0\u0003 \u0004 \b1\u0006 PBU\u0002Rmin\u0003\tH\u0002Lcr \u0006 L0\u0003\n\u0005 PBU\u0002Rmin\u0003 ~P2; (4)\nwhere H\u0002x\u0003, the Heaviside step function, is unity for x \n 0.\nFinally, the physical cross sections are calculated using\n \u0004i\u0002E0\u0003 \u0004 \u0003\u00052\nX\nL0\n\u00022L0 \u0005 1\u0003Pi\u0002E0; L0\u0003; (5)\nwhere \u00052 \u0004 @2=\b2mPE0\t and mP is the projectile mass.\nOther observables, e.g., the angle, kinetic energy, and\nrelative energy distributions of the fragments from\nNCBU events, are calculated by tracking their trajectories\nto a large distance from the target (200 fm in the calcu-\nlations presented below).\nIn order to validate our approach, NCBU observables,\nreliably calculated within the CDCC quantum mechanical\napproach, are compared with the classical model calcula-\ntion. We do so in a simplified model case for the reaction of\na pseudo-8Be projectile P (assuming a weakly bound state\nof two \u0002 particles) with a 208Pb target. The CDCC and\nclassical model calculations are matched as closely as\npossible, as discussed below.\nPRL 98, 152701 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending13 APRIL 2007\n152701-2\nWe bind P in a nodeless s state with a separation energy\nof 0.5 MeV in the Woods-Saxon (WS) potential well\n\u0002V; r; a\u0003 \u000b \u000216:7 MeV; 1:20 fm; 0:62 fm\u0003. The same po-\ntential was used to construct the continuum states of P,\nwhich are nonresonant in all partial waves. The Coulomb\npotential between all particles is that of uniformly charged\nspheres with a radius parameter 1.2 fm. The CDCC\nbreakup model space includes (i) even \u201812 up to 4@, (ii) a\nmaximum \u0002-\u0002 relative energy of 12 MeV, divided into\n12 bins in each partial wave, and (iii) \u0002-T potential multi-\npoles up to quadrupole terms. The \u0002-T optical potential is\nthe real WS interaction (62 MeV, 1.39 fm, 0.62 fm). A\ndiagonal absorptive WS potential (10 MeV, 1.30 fm,\n0.74 fm) is included in all channels, its range chosen so\nthat absorption occurs inside the fusion radius of the \u0002-T\nsystem, R\u0002TB \u0004 10:6 fm. Calculations were carried out at a\nlaboratory energy of E0 \u0004 45 MeV.\nA critical input to the classical model is the local pro-\njectile breakup probability P LBU\u0002R\u0003 at a separation R from\nthe target, deduced from PBU\u0002Rmin\u0003. To allow comparison\nwith the CDCC, PBU\u0002Rmin\u0003 has been deduced from the\nCDCC breakup cross sections, \u0004J\u0002NCBU\u0003, for each P-T\npartial wave. This is well represented by an exponential\nfunction (beyond the strongly absorbed partial waves),\nwith A \u0004 1:38 and \u0002 \u0004 0:293 fm\u00061 [see Eq. (1)].\nExperimental parameters defining PBU\u0002Rmin\u0003 have been\ndeduced from breakup measurements for the reaction\n9Be\u0005 208Pb for a wide range of sub-barrier energies\n[10]. The parameters which best describe the experimental\nNCBU yields are A \u0004 1:68\f 104 and \u0002 \u0004 0:922 fm\u00061.\nThe CDCC (dashed line) and empirical PBU\u0002Rmin\u0003 (thick\nsolid line) distributions are compared in Fig. 1. It is sig-\nnificant that the two functions are very different, the slope\nparameter \u0002 depending sensitively on the reaction and the\nbreakup mechanism. For instance, our model of 8Be\nbreakup, unlike the physical 9Be, does not generate\nCoulomb or nuclear dipole breakup couplings. Nor does\nit include the effect of neutron transfer channels that may\nbe significant in the empirical distribution [12]. This com-\nparison shows that the P LBU\u0002R\u0003 have high diagnostic value,\nand many reaction observables are also sensitive to the\nassumed P LBU\u0002R\u0003, as shown below.\nWe can now use the CDCC-derived P LBU\u0002R\u0003 as the\nsampling distribution in the stochastic classical model\ncalculations to assess the consistency of the observables\ncalculated with the quantum mechanical and classical dy-\nnamical models. In sampling breakup \u2018max \u0004 4@ and\n\"max \u0004 6 MeV. Guided by the calculated GS probability\nof the projectile, the Gaussian distribution of d12 values is\ntaken to have a centroid and variance of 1.8 fm and 1.0 fm,\nrespectively. The same real potentials are used as in the\nCDCC when solving the post-breakup three-body problem.\nThe potential used for the P\u00028Be\u0003-T system prior to\nbreakup, (120.9 MeV, 1.39 fm, 0.76 fm), is consistent\nwith the folding model potential derived from the \u0002-T\npotentials and the GS wave function of P. In this way the\nextended size and weak binding of P are taken into account\nprior to breakup. Values of L0 \u0007 100@ were found to be\nsufficient for the convergence of the observables.\nThe calculated total absorption and total NCBU cross\nsections from the CDCC are \u0004\u0002abs\u0003 \u0004 327 mb and\n\u0004\u0002NCBU\u0003 \u0004 97 mb, compared with \u0004\u0002abs\u0003 \u0004 300 mb\nand \u0004\u0002NCBU\u0003 \u0004 93 mb from the classical model.\nFigure 2 compares the CDCC (solid curves) and the clas-\nsical model (dashed curves) for (a) the breakup cross\nsections as a function of P-T partial wave, (b) the singles\n\u0002-particle angular distribution, (c) the \u0002-\u0002 relative energy\ndistribution, and (d) the singles \u0002-particle energy distribu-\ntion.

The former results in\nbreakup occurring much nearer to Rmin and thus to the\ntarget. The NCBU spin distribution when using the em-\npirical breakup function [panel (a)] now peaks at smaller\nangular momenta with a corresponding shift in the peak of\nthe \u0002 angular distribution to larger angles [panel (b)]. The\nstrong tidal forces experienced by the nonfused \u0002 particles\nthen lead to an enhanced \u0002-\u0002 yield of high relative energy\n[panel (c)] and corresponding changes to the singles \u0002\nenergies [panel (d)].\nThese first results already indicate a potentially very\nuseful and very sensitive mapping between (the unobserv-\nable) P LBU\u0002R\u0003 and the NCBU observables shown in Fig. 2.\nThe breakup function and reaction dynamics, probed by\ncombining the classical model and experimental data,\ncould thus provide much needed insight into the localiza-\ntion and nature of the breakup and fusion mechanism for\ndifferent reacting systems.\nFinally, we apply these ideas to experimental data. Using\nP LBU\u0002R\u0003 deduced from the empirical breakup function\n(thick solid line in Fig. 1), the model predicts CF and\nICF yields as shown by the thick solid and dashed curves\nin Fig. 3. These are close to the experimental data (triangles\nand circles). Only a small change in P LBU\u0002R\u0003 is required to\ngive a very good reproduction of the data (thin lines in\nFigs. 1 and 3). This result is the first quantitative result\nsupporting the suggested linkage [10] between the breakup\nprocess observed below the barrier and suppression of\ncomplete fusion observed at energies above the barrier.\nIn summary, a three-dimensional classical dynamical\nmodel for low energy reactions of weakly bound nuclei\nis presented, which for the first time allows consistent\nrealistic calculations relating below-barrier NCBU with\nabove-barrier CF and ICF. In the test case studied, the\nmodel, which treats the breakup process stochastically, is\nshown to reproduce the differential NCBU observables of\nthe CDCC quantum approach quite accurately. We have\nshown that the breakup probability function P LBU\u0002R\u0003 has\nhigh diagnostic value, being sensitive to the reaction\nmechanism and reactants, and that NCBU reaction observ-\nables are strongly sensitive to and can interrogate this\nmodel input. The model also demonstrates the importance\nof the breakup probability function, accessible from ex-\nperiments at sub-barrier energies, to predictions of com-\nplete and incomplete fusion yields of weakly bound\nprojectiles at energies above the Coulomb barrier.\nAll authors acknowledge support from an ARC\nDiscovery grant while J.

The classical model CF (dashed curves) and ICF (solid\ncurves) cross sections for 8Be\u0005 208Pb are compared with the\n9Be\u0005 208Pb experimental data of Ref. [1]. The energy and the\ncross section of the calculated and experimental data are nor-\nmalized by the barrier energies (B0 \u0004 40:7 MeV for thick\ncurves, B0 \u0004 40:5 MeV for thin curves, and B0 \u0004 37:5 MeV\nfor experimental data) and their respective radii (R0 \u0004 10:7 fm\nfor theoretical curves and R0 \u0004 10:8 fm for experimental data),\nobtained by fitting the above-barrier total fusion (CF\u0005 ICF)\ncross sections with the formula \u0004fus \u0004 \u0003R20\u00021\u0006 B0=Ec:m:\u0003.\nPRL 98, 152701 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending13 APRIL 2007\n152701-4\n"}
