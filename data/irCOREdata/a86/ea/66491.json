We find the\ngeneral matching conditions for the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet braneworld, which remarkably turn out\nto give precisely the four-dimensional Einstein equations for the induced metric and matter on the\nbrane, even when the extra dimensions are non-compact and have infinite volume. We also show\nthat relaxing regularity of the curvature in the vicinity of the brane, or alternatively having a finite\nwidth brane, gives rise to an additional possible correction to the Einstein equations, which contains\ninformation on the brane\u2019s embedding in the bulk and cannot be determined from knowledge of the\nbraneworld alone. We comment on the advantages and disadvantages of each possibility, and the\nrelevance of these results regarding a possible solution of the cosmological constant problem.\nPACS:11.25.Mj, 98.80.Jk IPPP\/03\/70, DCPT\/03\/49.\nThe braneworld paradigm, or the idea that our uni-\nverse might be a slice of some higher dimensional space-\ntime, has proved a compelling alternative to standard\nKaluza-Klein (KK) methods of having more than four\ndimensions. Briefly, in contrast to KK compactifica-\ntions, which have small and compact extra dimensions,\nbraneworlds can have large, even non-compact, extra di-\nmensions which have potentially important experimental\nconsequences [1, 2]. We do not directly see the extra di-\nmensions since we are confined to our braneworld, rather,\ntheir presence is felt via short-scale corrections to New-\nton\u2019s law, in some cases large scale modifications of grav-\nity, and as a means of generating the hierarchy between\nthe weak and Planck scales. Although being confined to\na slice in spacetime might seem odd, such confinement\nis in fact a common occurance. The early braneworld\nscenarios [3] for example used zero modes on topological\ndefects and of course in string theory we have confine-\nment of gauge theories on D-branes.\nFormally, the braneworld is a submanifold of the\nspacetime manifold, and can have any number of co-\ndimensions \u2013 the number of extra dimensions \u2013 up to\na maximum of 6\/7 for string\/M-theory. By far the\nbest investigated and understood braneworld scenario is\nthe codimension 1 case, or a toy 5-dimensional example\nmotivated by the Horava-Witten compactification of M-\ntheory [4]. This range of models, based on the seminal\nwork of Randall and Sundrum (RS) [2], has all the fea-\ntures one requires: Einstein gravity at some scale with\ncalculable modifications, well-defined cosmology asymp-\ntoting standard cosmology at late times, and has the\nadditional allure of exhibiting directly aspects of the\nadS\/CFT correspondance.\nFar less well understood are higher codimension\nbraneworlds. Although the pioneering work on resolv-\ning the hierarchy problem took place within the context\nof higher codimension, empirical models lack the grav-\nitational consistency of the RS scenarios. Attempts to\ninclude self-gravity have met with some success in codi-\nmension 2 [5, 6, 7], but for codimension three or higher,\nthe situation seems to be more problematic [8, 9].\nCodimension 2 brane worlds offer also some interest-\ning properties that can be exploited to attack the cosmo-\nlogical constant problem [7], but one drawback is that,\nin contrast to codimension 1, we appear to be very re-\nstricted in our allowed brane energy-momenta. Typically,\na brane in its ground state has a very special energy-\nmomentum tensor, which is isotropic and has the prop-\nerty that Energy=Tension. If we wish to have any mat-\nter on the brane, then we have to have a varying energy\ndensity and varying tension. However, as pointed out\nby Cline et al. [10] in the case of cosmological branes,\nthis is inconsistent with some basic minimal assumptions\nabout the nature of the braneworld. Essentially, it causes\nsingularities in the metric around the braneworld which\nnecessitates the introduction of a cut-off and hence in-\ntroduces questions of model dependence.\nIn this letter we suggest that the solution to the ap-\nparent sterility of codimension 2 braneworlds might lie\nin the Gauss-Bonnet term. This is a term that can be\nadded to the action in D > 4 (it is a topological invariant\nin 4D) that is quadratic in the curvature tensor but has\nthe well known property that the equations of motion de-\nrived from it remain second order differential equations\nfor the metric. In fact, since O(R2) corrections to the\nEinstein-Hilbert Lagrangian do arise in the low energy\nlimit of string theory, the inclusion of this type of term\ncould be regarded as mandatory if one wants to embed\nany braneworld solution into string\/M-theory. Fluctua-\ntions around a flat background for this model were stud-\nied in [11], and the conclusions obtained are compatible\nwith the ones presented in this Letter at the linearized\nlevel.\nIn trying to derive effective Einstein equations on the\nbrane, it is worth comparing and contrasting with codi-\nmension 1. Recall that for codimension 1 there is a sin-\n2gle normal to the braneworld, hence a single direction\nfrom the braneworld. For a general submanifold of codi-\nmension 2, there are now two normals, and for a regu-\nlar submanifold we again have a well-defined coordinate\npatch around it defined by the Gauss-Codazzi formalism.\n(This method was used to derive effective actions of topo-\nlogical defects [12].) The problem with trying to apply\nGauss-Codazzi in our case is that it requires some min-\nimal regularity of the metric near the braneworld, and\nthis is no longer the case for an infinitesimal braneworld\nin codimension 2 \u2013 the situation is even worse for codi-\nmension 3 and higher! Briefly, there is no well-defined\n\u201cthin braneworld\u201d limit for the Einstein equations [13],\nor alternatively, for the conical deficit, it is not possible to\nput two normals at the location of the deficit which have\na well defined inner product \u2013 it depends on whether you\nmeasure the outer or inner angle. In order to derive grav-\nity on the brane therefore, we instead use a coordinate\nsystem which is defined in the vicinity of the braneworld,\nand in which the effect of the brane formally appears as\na delta-function.\nWe assume that our braneworld has a nonsingular met-\nric, g\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd(x\n\u00b5), which is continuous in the vicinity of the\nbraneworld. The coordinates x\u00b5 label the braneworld\ndirections, and we will use greek indices to indicate\nbraneworld coordinates. We now take the set of points\nat a fixed proper distance from a particular x\u00b5 on the\nbrane, this will have topology S1, and we label these\npoints by x\u00b5, their proper distance, r, from x\u00b5, and an\nangle \u03b8, which without loss of generality we will take to\nhave the standard periodicity of 2pi. This method pro-\nvides a full coordinatisation of spacetime in the vicinity\nof the braneworld, and will be unique within the radii of\ncurvature of the braneworld. There are two remaining is-\nsues. One is that there is of course some ambiguity in the\nlabelling of \u03b8, which is equivalent to the choice of connec-\ntion on the normal bundle of the braneworld, however,\nfor simplicity we will assume that \u03b8 is chosen to make this\nconnection vanish (in particular, this means we assume\nthat the braneworld is not self intersecting). The second\nissue relates to the form of the bulk spacetime metric,\nwhich we will now assume has axial symmetry, i.e., \u2202\u03b8 is\na Killing vector. This Ansatz simplifies the bulk metric,\nand it is analogous to the assumption of Z2-symmetry in\nthe codimension 1 scenarios. The metric therefore can\nbe seen in these coordinates to take the general form:\nds2 = g\u00b5\u03bd(x, r)dx\n\u00b5dx\u03bd \u2212 L2(x, r)d\u03b82 \u2212 dr2. (1)\nIn order to obtain the braneworld equations, we now\nexpand the metric around the brane:\nL(x, r) = \u03b2(x)r +O(r2) (2)\netc. For values of \u03b2 6= 1 we have a conical singularity\nat r = 0, which is interpreted as being due to a delta-\nfunction braneworld source. Strictly speaking, at least\nin Einstein gravity, we cannot talk of a delta-function\nsource in terms of a zero-thickness limit of finite sources\n[13], rather, we deduce the existence of the delta-function\nin the Riemann tensor from the holonomy of a parallely\ntransported vector around the source. However, as the\nequations of motion make perfect sense with the delta-\nfunction being encoded in a notional discontinuity of the\nradial derivatives of the metric at r = 0, we follow the\nstandard procedure in this paper of defining L\u2032(x, 0) = 1,\ng\u2032\u00b5\u03bd(x, 0) = 0, in order to give rise to the required distri-\nbutional behaviour of the curvature in the gravitational\nequations (a prime denotes derivative with respect to r).\nTherefore, for a general braneworld, the problem we\nwish to solve is that of finding gravitating solutions that\ninclude the effect of a general brane energy-momentum\ntensor\nTMN =\n(\nT\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd(x)\n\u03b4(r)\n2piL 0\n0 0\n)\n(3)\n(upper case latin indices run over all the dimensions). In\nparticular, we will be interested in the relation between\nthe 4D induced metric on the brane, g\u00b5\u03bd(x, 0) = g\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd(x),\nand the brane energy momentum tensor, T\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd(x). It is\nthis relation which determines the nature of the gravita-\ntional interactions that a \u201cbrane observer\u201d would mea-\nsure.\nOur starting point is the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet\n(EGB) equation\nM4\n\u2217\n(GMN +HMN ) = TMN + SMN , (4)\nwhere\nGMN = RMN \u2212\n1\n2\ngMNR, (5)\nand the Gauss-Bonnet contribution is given by\nHMN = \u03b1\n[\n1\n2gMN (R\n2 \u2212 4RPQRPQ +R\nPQSTRPQST )\n\u2212 2RRMN + 4RMPR\nP\nN + 4R\nK\nMPNR\nP\nK\n\u22122RMQSPR\nQSP\nN\n]\n, (6)\nwith \u03b1 a parameter with dimensions of (mass)\u22122. SMN\nis the bulk energy momentum tensor, which we will not\nspecify here, other than to assume that it has no delta-\nfunction contributions.\nIf equation (4) is to be satisfied there must be a sin-\ngular contribution to the LHS of this equation with the\nstructure \u223c \u03b4(r)\nL\n. As we have already discussed, such a\ncontribution can arise from terms that contain:\nL\u2032\u2032\nL\n= \u2212(1\u2212 \u03b2)\n\u03b4(r)\nL\n+ (non\u2212 singular part),(7)\n\u22022rg\u00b5\u03bd\nL\n= \u2202rg\u00b5\u03bd\n\u03b4(r)\nL\n+ (non\u2212 singular part). (8)\nIn Einstein gravity, these latter terms are zero. However,\nsince they could in principle be nonzero, we will retain\nthem from now.\n3We must therefore set the delta-function contribution\nequal to the brane energy-momentum tensor in order to\nsolve the equations of motion. After some calculation,\none obtains that the only singular part of the LHS of\nequation (4) lies in the \u00b5, \u03bd directions and is:\n\u2212\nL\u2032\u2032\nL\n[\ng\u00b5\u03bd + 4\u03b1\n(\nR\u00b5\u03bd(g)\u2212\n1\n2\ng\u00b5\u03bdR(g)\n)]\n+\n\u03b1\nL\n\u2202r (L\n\u2032 W\u00b5\u03bd) ,\n(9)\nwhereW\u00b5\u03bd is defined as the following combination of first\nderivatives of the 4-dimensional metric\nW\u00b5\u03bd = g\n\u03bb\u03c3\u2202rg\u00b5\u03bb\u2202rg\u03bd\u03c3 \u2212 g\n\u03bb\u03c3\u2202rg\u03bb\u03c3\u2202rg\u00b5\u03bd\n+\n1\n2\ng\u00b5\u03bd\n[\n(g\u03bb\u03c3\u2202rg\u03bb\u03c3)\n2 \u2212 g\u03bb\u03c3g\u03b4\u03c1\u2202rg\u03bb\u03b4\u2202rg\u03c3\u03c1\n]\n.(10)\nWe can now use the properties\n\u2212\nL\u2032\u2032\nL\n= (1\u2212 \u03b2)\n\u03b4(r)\nL\n+ . . . , (11)\n\u2202r(L\n\u2032 W\u00b5\u03bd)\nL\n= \u03b2 W\u00b5\u03bd |r=0+\n\u03b4(r)\nL\n+ . . . , (12)\nto obtain the matching condition by equating the \u03b4(r)\nL\nterms of equation (4). This yields\n2pi(1\u2212 \u03b2)M4\n\u2217\n[\ng\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd + 4\u03b1G\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd + \u03b1\n\u03b2\n1 \u2212 \u03b2\nW\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd\n]\n= T\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd , (13)\nwhere G\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd is the 4D Einstein tensor for the induced met-\nric, g\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd , and W\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd \u2261W\u00b5\u03bd |r=0+ .\nThis is our main result: the gravitational equations\nof a braneworld observer are the Einstein equations plus\nan extra Weyl-term, W\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd , which depends on the bulk\nsolution. This term is reminiscent of the Weyl term in\nthe codimension 1 braneworlds [14], which gives rise to\nthe corrections to the Einstein equations on the brane.\nRoughly speaking, the braneworld equation is obtained\nby taking the components of the full Einstein equations\nparallel to the brane, with the perpendicular components\ngiving some information on the nature of the Weyl term.\nDepending on the symmetries present, in some cases (cos-\nmology being the most physically interesting) we can\ncompletely determine the bulk metric, and hence these\nWeyl corrections. For codimension 2, the perpendicular\ncomponents of the bulk equations do lead to constraints\nas we discuss presently, however these now no longer fix\nthe bulk metric exactly, not even for the highly symmet-\nric and special case of braneworld cosmology with Ein-\nstein gravity in the bulk. Let us now investigate the con-\nsequences of (13), in particular, the consistency of the\nextra Weyl term, which arose as a result of allowing a\ndiscontinuity in the derivative of the parallel braneworld\nmetric.\nA natural first check is to take the \u03b1 \u2192 0 limit to\nrecover the Einstein case. Then equation (13) reduces to\n2pi(1\u2212 \u03b2)M4\n\u2217\ng\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd = T\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd . (14)\nAlthough this looks like it is not possible to satisfy this\nmatching condition unless the brane energy momentum\ntensor is proportional to the induced metric, in fact we\nhave not yet determined whether \u03b2 is a constant. A non-\nconstant \u03b2 would correspond to a varying deficit angle,\nand is not determined by the braneworld equations alone.\nWe must supplement the braneworld equations with the\nbulk equations normal to the braneworld, and since we\nwish to make as few assumptions as possible about the\nbulk in this letter, we will simply look at the divergent\nO(1\/r) terms in the Einstein equations near the brane,\nas these cannot be cancelled by any regular bulk SMN .\nThese leading terms for the (\u00b5, \u03bd), (r, r) and (\u00b5, r) com-\nponents give\ng\u00b5\u03bd\n[L\u2032\u2032]\nL\n\u2212\nL\u2032\n2L\n[\u2202rg\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 g\u00b5\u03bdg\n\u03c1\u03c3\u2202rg\u03c1\u03c3] = 0,\nL\u2032\n2L\ng\u03c1\u03c3\u2202rg\u03c1\u03c3 = 0 ,\n\u2202\u00b5L\n\u2032\nL\n= 0, (15)\nwhere [L\u2032\u2032] stands here for the smooth part of the second\nderivative as we approach the brane. We now see directly\nthat \u03b2 must indeed be constant, and that \u22022rL|r=0+ = 0\nand \u2202rg\u00b5\u03bd |r=0+ = 0. We now confirm the observation of\nCline et al. [10], that Einstein codimension 2 braneworlds\nmust have an energy momentum proportional to their in-\nduced metric, and their gravitational effect is to produce\na conical deficit in the bulk spacetime.\nIn Gauss-Bonnet gravity however, the situation is not\nso simple, since all these equations get corrections pro-\nportional to \u03b1 and one cannot rule out the existence of\nsolutions with W\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd 6= 0. The O(1\/r) terms in the (\u00b5, r)\ncomponents of the EGB equations for example are\n\u2212 g\u03bd\u03c3\n\u2202\u03c3L\n\u2032\nL\n[\ng\u00b5\u03bd + 4\u03b1\n(\nR\u00b5\u03bd(g)\u2212\n1\n2\ng\u00b5\u03bdR(g)\n)\n\u2212 \u03b1 W\u00b5\u03bd\n]\n+ 2\u03b1\nL\u2032\nL\ng\u03bd\u03c3\n[\n\u2202rg\u00b5\u03bd R\n\u03c1\n\u03c3\u03c1r \u2212 \u2202rg\u03bd\u03c3 R\n\u03c1\n\u00b5\u03c1r\n]\n= 0, (16)\nwith similar constraints from the O(1\/r) terms of the\n(\u00b5, \u03bd) and (r, r) equations (though these are somewhat\nmore complicated and not particularly illuminating). In\nthis case we find that in general no simple restriction can\nbe placed on the solution, and in particular the deficit\nangle \u03b2 need no longer be constant.\nHowever, it is important to note that some compo-\nnents of the Ricci curvature tensor (and scalar) are now\ndivergent once we allow \u2202rg\u00b5\u03bd |0+ 6= 0. For example\nR\u00b5\u03bd =\n1\n2\nL\u2032\nL\n\u2202rg\u00b5\u03bd + . . . =\n\u2202rg\u00b5\u03bd\n2r\n+O(1), (17)\nnear the brane. In a realistic situation, we could argue\nthat a brane would have finite width, which could act as\na cut-off for the curvature, hence all our results would\nstill be valid provided this cut-off is sufficiently large so\nthat the curvature is still small compared to M2\n\u2217\n, the\nsix-dimensional Planck mass squared. In this smooth\ncase, we can use the Gauss-Codazzi formalism and the\n4\u03b8-independence of the metric to write\nW\u00b5\u03bd = K\n\u03bb\ni\u00b5\nK\ni\u03bd\u03bb \u2212KiKi\u00b5\u03bd +\n1\n2\ng\u00b5\u03bd\n[\nK2\ni\n\u2212K2\ni\u03bb\u03c3\n]\n, (18)\nwhere K\ni\u00b5\u03bd are the two extrinsic curvatures (i = 1, 2)\nfor each of the two normals. We therefore have the\ninterpretation of W\u00b5\u03bd as a geometric correction to the\nEinstein tensor due to the embedding of the braneworld\nin the bulk geometry. The interpretation is then that\nthe Einstein equations acquire additional embedding\nterms which unfortunately cannot be deduced from the\nbraneworld geometry alone.\nThe physical relevance of terms which lead to diver-\ngent curvatures and hence tidal forces in the vicinity of\nthe braneworld is however questionable. If M\u2217 is of or-\nder the (inverse) brane width, or if we wish to have a\ntruly infinitesimal brane, then we are forced to conclude\nthat for consistency we cannot stop at the GB curvature\ncorrections, but must include all higher order curvature\ncorrections thus entering a non-perturbative regime of\nwhich we can say nothing. We are therefore forced to\nimpose \u2202rg\u00b5\u03bd = 0, and equation (16) tells us that the\ndeficit angle \u03b2 is again constant and the equation for the\ninduced metric (13) remarkably takes the form of purely\nfour-dimensional Einstein gravity\nG\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd =\n1\n8pi(1\u2212 \u03b2)\u03b1M4\n\u2217\nT\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd \u2212\n1\n4\u03b1\ng\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd . (19)\nWe can read off our 4 dimensional Planck mass as\nM2Pl = 8pi(1\u2212 \u03b2)\u03b1M\n4\n\u2217\n, (20)\nand we note the presence of an effective 4 dimensional\ncosmological constant\n\u039b4 = T0 \u2212 2pi(1\u2212 \u03b2)M\n4\n\u2217\n, (21)\nwhere T0 is the bare brane tension:\nT\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd = T0 g\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd + \u03b4T\u00b5\u03bd . (22)\nOf course the splitting of the energy-momentum tensor in\nthis manner is potentially arbitrary, however, for a cos-\nmological brane \u03b4T\u00b5\u03bd \u2192 0 as t\u2192\u221e, and we can simply\nposit that \u03b4T\u00b5\u03bd \u2192 0 as either t or |x| \u2192 \u221e as being\na necessary requirement of a braneworld thus rendering\n(22) unambiguous.\nInterestingly, the Einstein relation between \u03b2 and the\nbrane tension: T0 = 2pi(1\u2212\u03b2)M\n4\n\u2217\nno longer holds for GB\ngravity \u2013 we can specify the conical deficit and the brane\ntension independently, the only caveat being that if the\nEinstein relation does not hold, then we have an effective\ncosmological constant on the brane.\nTo sum up: we have found the equations governing\nthe induced metric on the brane for a codimension 2\nbraneworld. We have shown that adding the Gauss-\nBonnet term allows for a realistic gravity on an infinites-\nimally thin brane which remarkably turns out to be pre-\ncisely four-dimensional Einstein gravity independent of\nthe precise bulk structure, the only bulk dependence ap-\npearing via the constant deficit angle \u2206 in the definition\nof the 4-dimensional Planck mass M2Pl = 4\u03b1\u2206M\n4\n\u2217\n. Since\nEinstein gravity appears quite generically, our model pro-\nvides a novel alternative realization of the infinite extra\ndimensions idea of Dvali et al. [15]. Indeed, we could\nmodify our model by adding braneworld Ricci terms\n(which can be motivated via finite width corrections to\nthe brane effective action [12]), which would give the\nsame form of the braneworld gravity equations, and sim-\nply renormalize the 4-dimensional Planck mass.\nWe also showed that it was possible to obtain a de-\nviation from Einstein gravity via a non-zero W\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd . In\nturn, this allows a variation of the bulk deficit angle and\ntherefore the effective brane cosmological constant. In\nthis case, one has to either perform a smooth regular-\nization of the brane by taking some finite width vortex\nmodel, or accept that the infinitesimally thin braneworld\nhas a non-perturbative regime in the neighbourhood of\nthe brane. Nevertheless it seems to be a very appeal-\ning feature towards a possible solution of the cosmologi-\ncal constant problem. One could envisage a situation in\nwhich the system is in a non-perturvative phase in which\nthe cosmological constant can vary, and relax itself dy-\nnamically to a perturbative state in which the induced\ngravity on the brane is four-dimensional Einstein gravity\nand with a very small cosmological constant (an infinite\nflat supersymmetric bulk might for instance lead to this\nsituation [16]). Due to the unbounded curvature near the\nbrane when this situation is violated it seems plausible\nthat once the system reaches that configuration it would\nprefer to remain there.\n[1] N.
