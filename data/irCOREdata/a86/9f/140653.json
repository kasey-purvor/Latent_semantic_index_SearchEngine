(1997) suggested the following function for the suboptimal pH range for the49\nratio of the growth rates with respect to the optimal growth rate (\uf06dopt) :50\n\uf028 \uf029pHpHpH\nopt\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\uf03d min101max \uf067\uf06d\n\uf06d\n(1)51\nWhereas Tienungoon et al. (2000) quoted a model for the full biokinetic range, which we52\nhave termed the Extended Presser Model (n.b, a publication error put the superoptimal pH53\nrange under a second square root).54\n55\n\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029maxmin 101101max pHpHpHpHpH\nopt\n\uf02d\uf02d \uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\uf03d \uf067\uf06d\n\uf06d\n(2)56\n57\nMany microorganisms of concern in foods have pH optima between 6 and 7, although58\nthere are some notable exceptions (see for example Fig 1 of Zwietering et al.1993).59\nAlthough, perhaps, not obvious, equation (2) imposes symmetry between the pHmin and60\npHmax, i.e. it assumes the pH optimum occurs exactly half-way between the two growth61\nextremes.62\n63\nOther models for pH used in the literature, which make use of Cardinal pH values, are the64\nsquare\u2013root type model (but with an extra fitting parameter \u2013 c2, Zwietering et al. 1992,65\n1993)66\n42\nmax2min\nmax2min\n)})(exp{1)((\n)})(exp{1)((\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\npHpHcpHpH\npHpHcpHpH\noptopt\npH\uf067 (3)67\n68\n, the simple Cardinal pH model,69\n70\n))((\n))((\nmaxmin\nmaxmin\noptopt\npH pHpHpHpH\npHpHpHpH\n\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\uf067 (4)71\n72\nand the expanded Cardinal pH model (CPM), (Rosso et al. 1995).73\n2\nmaxmin\nmaxmin\n)())((\n))((\nopt\npH pHpHpHpHpHpH\npHpHpHpH\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\uf067 (5)74\n75\nModels 1 to 5 are given in their Gamma form, which is the relative effect of a given pH to76\nthat at the optimal pH value; multiplication by, for example, \uf06dopt gives an absolute value.77\nFigure 1 shows the fit of the Extended Presser model (2) and the CPM (5) to published78\nCardinal parameter data for Listeria monocytogenes (cardinal parameters from Rosso et al.79\n1995). The symmetry of the Presser model is obvious; the pH optimum value allows the80\nCPM to model the majority of non-symmetrical (as well as symmetric) behaviour. The81\nfigure also shows that (2) allows for a plateau of growth rate, whereas the CPM insists on a82\nparticular optimum value.83\n84\nOne particular problem with pH models is that they are not 1:1 - two values of pH give the85\nsame growth rate. If we consider the definition of pH, that pH = -log[H+], then at face86\nvalue both a high and low concentration of hydrogen ions give the same growth rate effect.87\nIt is probably inherently understood that we really mean acid pH and alkali pH, but our88\nmodels do not distinguish this. Cole et al. (1990) showed that the pH inhibition of Listeria89\n5monocytogenes was better modelled using the hydrogen ion concentration suggesting that90\nthe inhibition was linearly related to the hydrogen ion concentration. Indeed model (2) can91\nbe rewritten as92\n\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029][1][1 21 \uf02d\uf02b \uf02d\uf02d\uf03d OHkHkpH\uf067 (6)93\n94\nFor the analysis of pH on the time to detection (TTD) of growth of bacterial cultures, we95\nhave used the hydrogen ion concentration directly (Lambert and Bidlas 2007). At96\nsuperoptimal pH values the model used in these previous studies fails \u2013 giving a simple97\nplateau of maximum growth for the given environmental conditions for all pH > pHopt. A98\nsimple rationalisation of the approximate bell-shaped or quadratic-like structure of many99\nobserved pH\/growth rate profiles leads to the supposition that the hydroxyl ion is now in100\ncontrol of the growth rate when pH > pHopt. Using the model published previously101\n(Lambert and Bidlas 2007), which employs the Gamma hypothesis as a base (Zwietering et102\nal.1992), a model was constructed using hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions directly, instead103\nof pH, and examined for its utility and is described herein.104\n105\n6Materials and methods106\nEffect of pH on the growth of E. coli107\nEscherichia coli ATCC 25922 was grown overnight in a flask containing 80ml tryptone108\nsoya broth (TSB, Oxoid CM 129), with shaking at 30oC. The cells were harvested,109\ncentrifuged to a pellet, washed and re-suspended in peptone water (0.1%). A standard110\ninoculum was produced by diluting the culture to an OD of 0.5 at 600nm. The pH of thirty111\nTSB solutions was adjusted with HCl to give a pH range from 7 to 3. These solutions were112\nplaced into a Bioscreen plate in triplicate. Diluted standard inoculum (pH adjusted) was113\nadded (50\uf06dl) to all wells except the negative control wells. The plate was then incubated in114\na Bioscreen Microbiological Analyser (Labsystems Helsinki, Finland) for 5 days at 30oC,115\nwith shaking, with OD readings taken every ten minutes.116\n117\nModel Fitting118\nThe models used in these studies were developed from the Lambert-Pearson model (LPM)119\nand the Extended Lambert-Pearson model (ELPM, Lambert and Pearson 2000; Lambert120\nand Lambert 2003). These models were used to examine time to detection (TTD) data from121\noptical density experiments. It was hypothesised that the general form of these equations122\nwould be applicable to growth rate data as obtained from traditional growth curve123\nmeasurements (Equation 7).124\n7for a given hurdle or hurdles \uf067 = \uf028 \uf029\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf02d\n\uf03e\n\uf02d\n\uf03c\n\uf03d\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n])ln[1(\n1\n0,\nif\nexp\n1\nif\n1,0][\n1\nEffC\ne\nElse\neEffC\nelse\nEffC\nthen\nEffC\nelse\nxif\nn\ni\ni\n(7)125\nwhere \uf067 = gamma factor (the ratio of the observed growth rate to the optimal growth rate),126\n[xi] is the concentration of the ith inhibitor, the effective concentration (EffC) is defined as127\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d \uf02d\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf03d\nn\ni\nP\ni\ni\ni\nP\nx\nEffC\n1 12\n2][\n(8)128\nP2i-1 is the concentration of the ith inhibitor giving a relative inhibition of 1\/e (approx.129\n0.37), P2i is a slope parameter which has been defined as the dose response due its130\nsimilarity with the Hill model.

The optimum time to detection for this particular185\nexperiment was 314 minutes.186\n187\nIt should be noted (in accordance with the suggestion of Cole et al. 1990) that plotting188\nTTD against the hydrogen ion concentration gave a good straight line fit down to pH 4.22,189\nbelow which the linear model failed. The variance of the data, however, increased with190\ndecreasing pH and a weighting regime should be used to reduce the bias. The reciprocal191\ntransformation of the TTD data gave homogeneous variance.192\n193\nThe CPM model (5) was applied to the data and gave a pHmin of 3.90 (3.85 \u2013 3.94) and a194\npH opt = 6.61 (6.49 \u2013 6.80). The MSE value of the fit of the CPM (0.00113) was smaller195\nthan that of the LPM (0.00121), however, it showed a high degree of correlation between196\nthe parameters unlike the LPM. This was due to fitting an inappropriate model (the CPM)197\nto the particular data set. Although the data were only obtained to a maximum pH of 7.2,198\nthe CPM was able to provide a fit, indeed predicting a pHmax of 10.20 (9.27 \u2013 11.77).199\n200\nA model for the full range of growth pH201\nData taken from the literature for the effect of the full pH range on microbial growth were202\nused to compare the effectiveness of the ELPM with either a simple quadratic or the CPM203\nmodels. In these cases the measured growth rates were used directly, where \uf067 = \uf06dmax\/\uf06dopt.204\n205\nListeria innocua: Le Marc et al 2002 : The growth rate over the pH range 4 \u2013 10 was206\nobtained for Listeria innocua (ATCC 33090) by Le Marc et al. (2002). The CPM model207\n11\nwas fitted to the data and the three Cardinal pH values obtained. Four other models were208\nalso fitted: a simple quadratic, the Presser model, the ELPMc and the ELPM. The fit of the209\nlatter two and the CPM model to the observed are shown in Figure 3. Table 1 compares210\ncardinal values obtained from the various models used. In general, the model with the211\nlowest MSE fits the observed data best. In this case the Presser model has the greatest212\nMSE and is the poorest fit, the quadratic model has a lower MSE than the CPM, but not to213\nthe ELPM, which has the lowest MSE of the five models tested. The latter model\u2019s main214\ndrawback (as is the case with the simple quadratic model), is that the three Cardinal pH215\nvalues have to be calculated unlike the CPM where the cardinal parameters are explicit.216\nThe pHmin and pHmax are relatively easy to calculate from a standard equation (12),217\nhowever, to obtain the optimum pH requires differentiating the model with respect to pH218\nand finding the root (eqn. 13). This can be quickly accomplished using Mathematica.219\n220\nButyrivibrio fibrisolvens: Rosso et al (1995) used the pH data of Kistner et al (1979) to221\ndescribe the utility of the CPM. Several such data sets were used, some containing only222\nfew data leading to limited degrees of freedom in the fitting of a model. The data for B.223\nfibrisolvens were obtained and analysed using the models described. The pHmin, pHmax224\nand pHopt cardinal values obtained by the CPM were 5.42 (5.32 \u2013 5.61), 7.56 (7.41 \u2013225\n7.83), and 6.54 (6.44 \u2013 6.63) respectively and for the ELPMc were 5.37 (5.31 -5.44), 7.68226\n(7.59 \u2013 7.77), and 6.52 (6.49 \u2013 6.57) respectively. In this case all models fitted the data227\nwell, including the basic quadratic, Table 2. The symmetric nature of the pH profile lends228\nitself well to the ELPMc (Figure 4). From the MSE value, this model was considered to229\ngive the best fit to the observed data, the simple quadratic also gave a better fit, in this230\ncase, than the CPM.231\n232\n12\nBacillus thermoamylovorans: a moderately thermophilic, non-spore forming bacterium233\nisolated from palm wine. Data from Combet-Blanc et al. (1995) were used to construct the234\npH\/growth profile, shown in Figure 5 along with the fitted CPM and ELPM. Essentially,235\nboth the CPM and the ELPM fit the data well. The pHmin, pHmax and pHopt cardinal236\nvalues obtained by the CPM were 5.41 (5.34\u2013 5.47), 8.46 (8.41 \u2013 8.51), and 6.92 (6.86 \u2013237\n6.98) respectively and for the ELPM were 5.40 (5.34 -5.46), 8.42 (8.36 \u2013 8.47), and 6.94238\n(6.88 \u2013 7.00) respectively. An analysis of the MSE, Table 2, shows that the ELPM fitted239\nthe data to a better degree.240\n241\nSome of the other data sets used by Rosso et al. (1995) were further analysed (Table 2) and242\nshowed that the CPM model fitted data to a better degree than other models when the243\nnumber of data (degrees of freedom) were small. This suggests that where data is sparse244\nthen the CPM offers the best alternative and the ELPM be used when data is not limiting.245\n246\nLactobacillus plantarum: The growth rate of L. plantarum was analysed by Cuppers and247\nSmelt (1993) as a function of pH at two temperatures: 21 and 15oC. They showed that the248\ngrowth rate dropped by approximately 50% at the lower temperature, but that the minimum249\nand optimum pH did not appear to change. Table 3 describes the results obtained from250\nfitting the models to the published data. Data obtained at 15oC were not amenable to a251\nfitting by the models described \u2013 there were sparse data beyond the expected pHopt value.252\nThe CPM returns a very large confidence interval, the ELPM refused to compute one.253\nApplying the LPM for the effect of hydrogen ion only (eqn. 10), gave the parameters P0 =254\n0.0812 (0.078 \u2013 0.084), P1 = 0.000132 (0.00103 \u2013 0.00018), P2 = 0.889 (0.647 \u2013 1.177),255\nMSE = 1.00x10-5. A Monte Carlo analysis (10,000 iterations) gave the pHmin = 3.45 (3.31256\n\u2013 3.55).257\n13\n258\nOne of the consequences of the Gamma hypothesis is that it suggests that different259\nantimicrobial hurdles act independently. The ELPM was modified to take account of the260\nchange in the maximum growth rate with temperature (through the addition of a simple261\nlinear model between 21 and 15oC). The combined data set was then re-modelled. Figure 6262\nshows the ELPM applied to the data set taking into account the temperature change.263\n264\nThe fit of the model suggests that the Gamma hypothesis is valid: pH and265\ntemperature are independent factors affecting the growth of this organism over the ranges266\nstudied. Using the F-test method described by Pin and Baranyi (1998) it was shown that267\nthere was no significant difference (F = 1.753, P=0.15), between the two separated models268\nand the combined model, which might have been expected if temperature had an influence269\non the fitting parameters. A comparison of the CPM with the ELPM showed that the latter270\nmodel gave the better fit to the data available. The cardinal pH values were obtained and a271\ncomparison made to the CPM, Table 4.272\n273\n14\nDiscussion274\npH is a major hurdle used by the food industry to stabilise products from microbiological275\ngrowth. In general the minimum pH for pathogen growth is known (less frequently for276\nspoilage organisms) and can be used to set limits for the pH of foods. One of the recurring277\nproblems with Cardinal values is a lack of knowledge of how the effect of other hurdles278\nsuch as temperature or the addition of weak acid preservatives interact or combine with279\npH. For example the pH minimum for growth of E. coli is considered to be approximately280\n4.0, but if at pH 4.0 the product cannot be sold for taste reasons, can a higher pH be used in281\nconjunction with another hurdle? In essence this is the idea behind the \u2018Cole cliff face\u2019,282\nwhere increased knowledge about combined hurdles can allow greater flexibility in283\nformulation, whilst retaining safety or shelf-life.284\n285\nThe ELPM, developed from the original Lambert & Lambert (2003) model, allows286\ndifferent antimicrobial hurdles to be analysed separately and then to be assembled together287\nto form a quantitative multiple-hurdle system.288\n289\nWithin the open literature the pH model developed by Rosso et al. in the mid-90\u2019s290\nhas become the standard model for the effect of pH and is known as the Cardinal pH model291\n(CPM). If the three cardinal pH values are known \u2013 pH minimum, optimum and maximum292\nthen the CPM can be used directly, else data are obtained over the full pH growth range293\nand these cardinal values estimated. One interesting aspect of this fitting method is that294\nboth the pH minimum and pH maximum are extrapolated values since a value of \u2018no295\ngrowth\u2019 cannot be used in the fitting process. Since the CPM model is a polynomial296\nquotient function, such extrapolation is usually not permitted. But since the model \u2018works\u2019297\nthis mathematical discrepancy is usually overlooked. The CPM is well suited to certain298\ntypes of pH profiles, but not to those with a flatter region which encompasses the pH299\n15\noptimum. This occurs when the range between the pHmin and pHmax is greater than approx. 5.5300\npH units and the dose response (as described by the P2i parameters in the ELPM) is high (a301\nP2i value greater than approx 0.85), and under these conditions there is a clear difference302\nbetween these two models. The CPM is at its best when the pH profile is close to303\nsymmetric about the pHopt, but a simple quadratic may also provide a good fit to the data.304\n305\nSome of the reasons put forth by Rosso for the adoption of the CPM by the306\nmodelling community were that it gave biologically relevant parameters and did not give307\nstructural correlations between parameters (which caused problems with the parameter308\nestimates especially with the calculation of confidence intervals). The CPM also had309\n\u2018parsimony\u2019 \u2013 a minimum number of parameters and was also convenient to use for310\nbiologists. The one thing that was missing from the list of advantages was whether the311\nmodel created an advance in the discipline itself or was just a simple (but elegantly312\nconstructed) empirical tool for estimating values previously defined, e.g. pHmin.313\n314\nThe simple idea that the pH-growth profile is due to hydrogen ions and hydroxyl315\nions is, of course, not ground-breaking, but few people question the dichotomy of using pH316\nwhich is defined using the hydrogen ion concentration when the pH profile is not317\nmonotonic. The model developed herein splits the contribution of pH into its two318\nconstituent parts and attempts to model on that basis. This model is generally more suitable319\nto pH data than is the CPM. Furthermore the parameters used to describe the model are320\nthose found from experimental data unlike the CPM which relies on extrapolation to define321\nthe cardinal values used in its own fitting. In some cases using a constrained model, by322\nforcing P2i = 1, (the ELPMc) improves the fit over the CPM, in these cases the pH profile323\nwas found to be symmetric and the dose responses are approximately 1.324\n325\n16\nUnlike the CPM, the ELPM requires the pH minimum, pH maximum and pH326\noptimum to be calculated. This is a relatively simple and elementary process and a model327\nshould not be discarded, as Rosso et al. suggested, simply because it is not immediately328\namenable to those without the required background in mathematics. The advances in329\nmathematical software (e.g. Mathematica, Math-Lab) and in the robustness of statistical330\npackages such as JMP or Statistica, places in the hands of microbiologists a very331\ncomprehensive toolbox with which to investigate large amounts of data and\/ or to provide332\nvery sophisticated analyses.333\n334\nThe major importance of the use of the ELPM is that it shows that growth across335\nthe entire pH range can be modelled by a simple, general, equation. Indeed the model used336\nhas not been modified in any way from its normal appearance \u2013 we have simply considered337\nhydroxyl ion as a separate antimicrobial factor to hydrogen ion. When data is sparse, e.g.338\nwhen experiments have been conducted under acid conditions only, then the ELPM can be339\nreduced to the more simple LPM (i.e. the ELPM with n = 1 (eqn. 10))340\n341\nThe ELPM contains all the features that Rosso et al. suggested make a good model,342\nbut it also introduces the idea of the dose response \u2013 a phenomenon reflected in the P2i343\nparameters, which is absent from the CPM. In some cases the dose response of hydrogen344\nions and hydroxyl ions are similar and approximately equal to 1 (hence the ELPMc345\nequation fits the data well) at other times they are different. Zwietering et al. 1993 gives346\nthe pH range for a group of organisms: many are symmetric, but notably Pseudomonas and347\nListeria are asymmetric. Are the latter observations a reflection of different metabolic348\nstrategies used to maintain homeostasis in different pH environments whereas a symmetric349\npH response shows a conservative metabolic response? With the advent of systems350\n17\nmicrobiology beginning to be applied to food microbiology (Brul et al 2007), that we can351\nask the question is a step in the right direction.352\n353\n18\nReferences354\n355\nBrul, S., Mensonides, F.
