The model is\nstable enough to be tried in other institutions and continues to develop in scope.\nKeywords: e-learning design; capability; pathfinder; team working; CARPE DIEM\nmodel\nThe context and the challenge\nThe University of Leicester in the UK has many characteristics of a traditional campus-\nbased university, including a high skills base of face-to-face lecturing and an autonomous\ndepartmental structure. In addition to its 12,000 campus-based undergraduates, Leicester\nhas a thriving set of distance learning programmes serving around 7,200 students. Although\nthe university is research-led, its teaching is popular with students, achieving high\ncompletion rates and top ranking over the three years of The National Student Survey\n(thestudentsurvey.com).\nA Virtual Learning Environment (VLE, Blackboard) was introduced by the IT depart-\nment and supported by the Staff Development Unit from 2002, but without a strategic plan\nfor using learning technologies or any deliberate revision of pedagogical approaches. The\nVLE was used at first only by innovators and early adopters among the staff (Hannan 2005).\nStudents\u2019 responses to learning via the VLE varied.\nHowever, the university soon recognised that increased VLE use by both campus and\ndistance students could support and extend its traditional ways of learning and teaching, and\nintroduce productive, positive changes in students\u2019 learning experiences. There was neither\na crisis nor a serious problem to solve, but a strategic intent to adopt appropriate technologies\nand pedagogical approaches, thus building on Leicester\u2019s success in teaching and research.\nIn 2004, the university created a Chair to raise the profile of e-learning, exploit learn-\ning technologies and positively impact on the student learning experience across all\nmodes of learning and disciplines. In 2005, the university\u2019s Senate accepted and resourced\nan e-learning and pedagogical innovation strategy (Salmon 2005), aligned with the Higher\n*Corresponding author. Email: alejandro.armellini@le.ac.uk\n96  G. Salmon et al.\nEducation Funding Council for England (HEFCE) e-learning strategy of March 2005\n(HEFCE 2005). The university\u2019s e-learning strategy was to promote pedagogical innova-\ntion, increase deployment of learning technologies and enable research into e-learning in a\nway that directly addressed business opportunities and imperatives. It provided for equiva-\nlent and enhanced learning and support experiences for all the university\u2019s students,\nregardless of their modes of study. It offered a framework to deepen understanding and\ndeployment of learning technologies within the university. Although aware of the debate\nbetween centralised provision and devolution of academic development (Hunt 2006), the\nuniversity felt that departmental autonomy should be acknowledged and valued. Academ-\nics were to be encouraged with support and evidence for the changes rather than receiving\na central directive. There was no obvious central unit such as a technology centre to\nprovide a lead. The strategy provided for a research unit to provide evidence and guide\nchange, working with the IT services, Staff Development and the Library.\nImplementing strategy\nIn 2005, the university began implementing its new e-learning and pedagogical innovation\nstrategy (Salmon 2005). The framework for the academic development needed is based on\na \u2018resource\u2019 definition of change (Salaman and Asch 2003), focusing on developing capa-\nbility for different purposes through collaborative effort. Such a framework implies identi-\nfying the institution\u2019s core capabilities and existing strengths (what it is good at, what makes\nit special), and how a strategy can take advantage of these in a competitive world (what can\nit do well and differently?).\nLeicester believed that its e-learning and pedagogical innovation strategy, if based\non those kinds of strengths, would be more durable and harder to imitate, than \u2018off-the-\nshelf\u2019 strategies (Hamel and Valikangas 2003) or those based on a traditional market-led\napproach (Salaman and Asch 2003). The strategy also acknowledges the importance of\nthe university\u2019s characteristics and context. It focuses on awareness of the pedagogical\npotential of learning technologies and of design for learning (Laurillard 2007). One of the\nstrategy\u2019s four parts is aimed at building the institution\u2019s existing skill base of learning\nand teaching with stable technologies such as the VLE, whilst the others look towards\noutreach work; exploitation of Web 2.0 and personal devices; and futures forecasting\n(Salmon 2005).\nChoices for academic support for e-learning\nThe reluctance of some university teachers to embrace change in their pedagogy, whether\nassociated with e-learning or other initiatives, is well documented (Sharpe, Benfield, and\nFrancis 2006; Flemming and Rutherford 1985). Academics tend to think of issues relating\nto learning, teaching and assessment in terms of their own discipline \u2013 their own \u2018tribe and\nterritory\u2019 (Becher and Trowler 2001, 1). This strong disciplinary focus, arising from episte-\nmological and social sources, can inhibit acceptance of change (Becher and Trowler 2001).\nAcademics work within the dominant discourse about teaching in their discipline and may\nbe antipathetic to staff development, advice or theory or research which is not discipline-\nbased (Jenkins 1996). Others are keen to try out new technologies but \u2018unsympathetic to\ncentrally determined initiatives and unable to gain support for their own ideas\u2019 (Hannan\n2005, 981).\nDual mode universities like Leicester present special challenges (Ask 2007). Whilst\ncampus teaching succeeds well within the autonomy of faculties, departments and teachers,\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   97\nteaching at a distance needs longer term, operational management (Renwick 1992). At\nLeicester, distance learning emerged from and was embedded in 12 different departments;\nstrenuous efforts are necessary to achieve economies of scale through support systems.\nLeicester\u2019s framework for implementing e-learning therefore needed to be pedagogi-\ncally driven rather than technology-led (Laurillard 2007), flexible enough to incorporate\nnew leading-edge technologies and rooted in disciplinary practice. Where distance learning\nwas involved, preparation needed to include \u2018design once, deliver to many\u2019 (Renwick\n1992). The strategy encompassed and promoted a contextualised, complex view of the value\nof e-learning (Salmon 2005), to meet the university\u2019s objectives. The strategy needed to\naccommodate new learning technologies including those not originally designed for learn-\ning, such as student-owned devices such as iPods and PDAs (Salmon and Nie 2008).\nThe benchmarking exercise\nThe Beyond Distance Research Alliance (BDRA), charged with developing and supporting\nlearning innovation in the university, was established in parallel with the e-learning strat-\negy. A year after the strategy\u2019s launch, BDRA worked on an e-learning benchmarking exer-\ncise, supported by the Higher Education Academy\u2019s (henceforth \u2018Academy\u2019) Pilot Phase of\nthe Pathfinder Programme. The exercise provided quantitative and qualitative information\non how far institutions are embedding different aspects of e-learning into institutional policy\nand practice. The first benchmarking at the University of Leicester, February\u2013June 2006,\nwas supported by an Academy-provided expert consultant. An internal steering group\nguided data-collection and analysis. Scores were established by a university-wide team.\n\u2018Instructional design & pedagogy\u2019 and \u2018learning materials\u2019 were issues on which the univer-\nsity scored lower than on other criteria. A second benchmarking exercise, using the same\ncriteria and measures, took place from March\u2013July 2007. See Table 1 for details and scores.\nIn 2006 each benchmarking criterion was scored on a scale of 1\u20135, with 1 designating base-\nlevel activity and 5 designating maximum activity. In 2007 the scale was 1\u20136, with 6 as\n\u2018excellence\u2019, \u2018transcendence\u2019, or \u2018second wave\u2019 situations in the sector. The change was\nintroduced by the developers (Matic Media Ltd, http:\/\/www.matic-media.co.uk\/). Bench-\nmarking was recognised as an efficient way to evaluate the effectiveness of the university\u2019s\ne-learning strategy and the progress made in the intervening period.\nThe benchmarking results suggested that the VLE and other stable and highly supported\ntechnologies such as the digital library were not being used as effectively as they could be\nby most academic staff. The university subsequently decided to build the capability of its\nacademic staff to understand and practise designing for learning. Design bridges theory and\npractice (Beetham and Sharpe 2007), and can be acquired and built upon by small teams.\nThe university also needed the quickest possible interventions that \u2018made a difference\u2019 to\nstudent learning, given that academics\u2019 time is limited: teaching competes with research and\nadministrative duties.\nThe challenge for BDRA was to develop capability in e-learning design that would\nengage Leicester\u2019s academics. BDRA had to enthuse them to build on good practice,\nadapting their own practice to new modes of learning and forms of learning technologies.\nBDRA wanted to \u2018beguile\u2019 and entice the academics, persuading them to engage with\nstudent learning activities on the VLE, work together and work with others who could help\nthem. Each intervention needed to be appropriate for a variety of different disciplines and\nmodes of learning, and yet had to keep responsibility within the subject team. It had to fit\nthe autonomous cultures and structures at Leicester but also contribute to building capability\nin e-learning.\n98  G. Salmon et al.\nBackground to the intervention\nThe intervention is through a workshop, called CARPE DIEM, designed to encourage small\nteams to work together on e-learning design using a VLE. The two-day workshop offers\nacademics, for a small commitment in time, quick realisation of their investment in learning\ndesign. The CARPE DIEM workshop model (see Figure 1) is based on story boarding\n(Tumminello 2004), team working (Jaques and Salmon 2006), scaffolding of networked\nlearning, especially Salmon\u2019s 5-stage model and e-tivities (Salmon 2002) and aligned\nassessment (Biggs and Tang 2007). It involves six sequential progressive collaborative\ntasks, led by a trained facilitator familiar with the process. Day 1 is a visioning and planning\nday (no computers); day 2 deploys the VLE.\nFigure 1. The CARPE DIEM workshop model.CARPE DIEM workshops began in 2002 at Caledonian Business School, Glasgow\nCaledonian University, when it introduced a VLE (Blackboard). Feedback from participat-\ning staff from the first three workshops (Salmon 2003, 2004), plus feedback from students\nwhen the courses were first presented (Siddiqui and Roberts 2004), indicated that: \n\u25cf students were on the whole engaged and happy with the e-tivities they were offered,\nones that had been developed during the workshops;\nTable 1.

Pathfinder\nprojects were Academy-funded and followed on from e-learning benchmarking. They\noffered HEIs an opportunity to try a transformation initiative with organisational change,\ndevelopment and dissemination as core aims. Similar interventions include the University of\nHertfordshire\u2019s CABLE project (Anderson et al. 2008) and Oxford Brookes\u2019 Intensives\n(Benfield 2008).\nADELIE was independent of routine staff development and had the flexibility for\nBDRA to forge a partnership for design (rather than a training or development relationship)\nwith participants in various disciplines. It was important that academic teaching staff felt in\ncontrol of discipline-related aspects of the design and that the specific learning requirements\nfor their discipline were reflected in their designs. As an intervention, ADELIE offered\nCARPE DIEM sessions for designing both on-campus and distance e-learning courses. By\nOctober 2007, the ADELIE team had worked through the CARPE DIEM process with 16\ncourse teams in 11 disciplines.\nFigure 1. The CARPE DIEM workshop model.\n100  G. Salmon et al.\nThe university chose CARPE DIEM as the intervention to address issues of capability\nbuilding in e-learning design across different disciplines and modes of learning. CARPE\nDIEM offered important capability building for Leicester, that could support the prevailing\ncultures and thus be accepted: \n\u25cf Discipline-based teams are invited to take part. CARPE DIEM is not seen as staff\ndevelopment, but a supportive academic activity. Other professions in the university\nare brought in to work with the subject teams. CARPE DIEM participants include a\nfacilitator with pedagogical knowledge, a subject librarian, a learning technologist\nplus the subject specialists. All course team members and other professionals are\nexpected to be present and participate throughout the two-day workshop.\n\u25cf A trained facilitator leads the workshop using the CARPE DIEM model and process,\nand pre-prepared activities and resources, to make the most of the team\u2019s time\ntogether.\n\u25cf The workshop is centred on a new course, or one transferred from a different mode of\nlearning to incorporate new technologies or approaches. The curriculum and learning\noutcomes are agreed by the subject group before arrival in the workshop. Inevitably\nsome discussions on content ensue but the CARPE DIEM facilitator helps prevent\ncontent discussions dominating pedagogical ones.\n\u25cf The intervention is focused on practical and contextualised outcomes for one\nparticular course, module or programme team. Although the workshops complement\nindividual staff development activities, they are clearly distinguished from them by\npromising to \u2018get your course online \u2013 together\u2019.\n\u25cf Only stable \u2018tried and tested\u2019 technologies are used so that the focus can shift to peda-\ngogy and the learning experience as soon as possible. Typically these were the VLE\nand the digital library, although wikis and podcasting are now being tried.\n\u25cf No computers are used until a \u2018blueprint\u2019 and \u2018storyboard\u2019 are agreed by the team.\nOther related activities continued in the university. The Staff Development Unit continued\nto build on their learning technology and e-learning courses and IT and systems provision\nwas scaled up. The Media Zoos were established for sharing learning technology research\noutcomes and providing \u2018safe\u2019 environments for staff to experiment with learning technol-\nogies (www.le.ac.uk\/beyonddistance\/mediazoo). Learning technology seminars and an\nannual local conference were established.\nADELIE as research\nRunning alongside the intervention was a research study aimed at establishing whether\nCARPE DIEM is an appropriate tool for capability building in e-learning design at\nLeicester, testing the intervention model in various disciplines and with different kinds of\nprofessional teams. The study was developed as action research (Lomax 1994) rooted in the\ncontext of higher education (Eden and Husham 1996). Bhattacharya, Cowan, and Weedon\n(2000) demonstrate that action research in educational settings offers opportunities for\nincorporating feedback and evaluation into change processes, and can lead to generalisable\nmodels.\nThe CARPE DIEM model and the intervention process evolved through analysis of\nparticipants\u2019 feedback. This paper reports on the viability, scalability and enhancement\nof the model and evidence of capability building amongst academics in the University\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   101\nof Leicester. Armellini and Jones (2008) report on pedagogical developments from the\nresearch.\nThree approaches were employed for collecting data: \n\u25cf Observations of meetings and workshops in the form of notes and recordings;\n\u25cf Semi-structured interviews with participants from subject groups involved in CARPE\nDIEM workshops;\n\u25cf Collection of artefacts in the form of course designs and e-tivities produced during\nand after the workshops.\nDepartments taking part knew that ADELIE was a research as well as a development project\nand agreed to participate on this basis. Specifically, they agreed to observations and records\nbeing made of all aspects of their participation before, during and after the CARPE\nDIEM workshops, including reference to the e-learning designs they produced. Individual\nmembers of the course teams agreed to take part in semi-structured interviews before and\nafter the CARPE DIEM workshops. The names of individuals have been removed here and\nthe names given to course teams have been generalised to indicate a discipline rather than\na specific course, to preserve anonymity.\nThe research was designed so that the ADELIE team members were able to review and\nevaluate the process and make changes in the CARPE DIEM model throughout its imple-\nmentation. A protocol for observing the workshops recorded the course teams\u2019 engagement\nwith the activities, critical incidents, values and practices around course development and\nevidence of capability building.\nThe ADELIE interview schedule consisted of two semi-structured interviews with a\nvolunteer from each participating course team. Volunteers included course leaders and\ntutors. Interviews lasted 45 minutes and occurred one month before and six weeks after\nparticipation in the CARPE DIEM workshop. The pre-CARPE DIEM interviews probed\nthe individual\u2019s typical uses of and attitudes towards e-learning and the common e-learning\npractices within that person\u2019s course team. The questioning revealed motivations for\nattending CARPE DIEM and what the participant envisaged would be the benefit to\ncourse design. The post-CARPE DIEM interviews probed for what was learned in the work-\nshop and investigated how individual and team learning might translate into capability\nbuilding.\nInterview and observation transcripts were analysed using QSR N6 software. The range\nand sequence of this data collection, plus the analysis of e-learning designs produced by\nparticipants during and after the workshops, made it possible to establish and track changes\nin capability.\nRevising the CARPE DIEM model\nSoon after ADELIE started, it became clear that the two-day CARPE DIEM workshop\nalone was insufficient for full engagement with course teams. Participants needed very good\nreasons to clear two days of their diaries. Trust in the ADELIE team and a full understand-\ning of the purpose and expected outcomes of the workshop were essential for engaging and\nmotivating course teams. Contact meetings before the workshops were added to ensure that\nthe two workshop days were truly \u2018seized\u2019 for designing for learning. Interview data\nsuggested that a follow-up meeting for review and re-design was also essential. The revised\nmodel emerged as outlined in Table 2.\n102  G. Salmon et al.\nOutcomes of the CARPE DIEM intervention\nPre-workshop contact meetings\nThese meetings with course teams, before they committed to becoming ADELIE partners,\nrevealed aspects of their culture and practices surrounding pedagogy. Teaching and assess-\nment methods used by the department were surfaced. The pre-meetings enabled the ADELIE\nteam to learn about each course team\u2019s needs and modules or programmes they intended\nto design for and to pre-empt early misunderstandings about e-learning. Some course\nteams changed their plans at this early stage. One team reorganised their overall course plan\nbefore attending the workshop, which made it possible for them to design for collaborative\ne-learning. Other departments, before attending the workshop, considered possible implica-\ntions of their new e-learning designs, such as developing tutors\u2019 e-moderating skills.\nThe individualistic culture in university teaching, and how resources for teaching are\nallocated in departments at Leicester, made commitment of a subject team to a two-day\nworkshop a hurdle to overcome. BDRA offered the Media Zoo physical environment for the\nworkshops (www.le.ac.uk\/beyonddistance\/mediazoo) at no recharge cost.\nPreviously, many academics had worked largely alone on developing their courses:\nvery few had experienced the benefits of working with learning technologists and subject\nlibrarians in a structured way. Interviews confirmed that bringing the team together to begin\nplanning pedagogy and course development was a valued change in their practice. The\nprocess provided opportunities to \u2018thrash out team differences and come together to a team\nconsensus\u2019 (L. Inter-Professional Education) and \u2018real enjoyment and enthusiasm [was]\nexperienced by course teams [preparing for their two-day workshop]\u2019 (P. Education).\nThe CARPE DIEM workshops\nThe CARPE DIEM workshops yielded largely positive evaluations by the participating\ncourse teams. They reported that determining pedagogic and subject knowledge goals\nTable 2.

Impact on \nlearner experience.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   103\ncollectively for their course was an effective activity for them. They were able to exploit\nthe technological tools provided by the university for e-learning design and delivery better\nthan before, and to make effective choices about task design, resources and technologies.\nThe process was iterative and reflective: at all stages the ADELIE team provided input,\ninsight, feedback and advice, thus increasing the course team\u2019s understanding of pedagogy\nand their technological capability. The workshops were also practical and useful: teams left\nwith at least two online activities, an overall course framework based on networked learn-\ning, a much wider and purposeful exploitation of the VLE\u2019s features and a clear action\nplan. \nCARPE DIEM did have an impact on our department. So things have moved a lot in the last\nfew months \u2026 in the course spec we specifically put in that we wanted \u2018proper\u2019 online learning\nand \u2026 staff development in e-learning. (P. Education)\nLearning to design e-tivities proved to be a catalyst for shifting participants\u2019 understanding\nof pedagogy. Both interview and observation data revealed their increased understanding,\nespecially in designing to increase learners\u2019 engagement with the course, its resources and\neach other. \nWe have developed three activities. One of those was developed in the workshop the other two\nwere done afterwards by [colleague\u2019s name] and myself. One was on similar lines to the one\ndone in the workshop and the other was a wiki that was \u2026 inspired by some of the discussion\nin the workshop. (R. Law)\nCARPE DIEM is a course design intervention, not a workshop on how to use a VLE.\nHowever, in designing e-tivities collaboratively and in context, teams learn about VLE\nfeatures that may be new to them but fit for their desired pedagogical purpose. These\ninclude wikis, blogs and the embedding of sound or video.\nSeveral teams reported a concern of \u2018being taken over\u2019 by others who did not understand\nthe special needs of their subject. However, this fear gradually dissipated over the two days\nand participants commented that they felt in control of their planning. \nWe felt we were working with you and we had time to sort out what we wanted to do.\n(J. Geography)\nPost-CARPE DIEM interviews showed that all the subject teams had reflected on the poten-\ntial and role of e-learning in learning and teaching in ways that they had not considered\nbefore. The extent to which this shift was innovative depended on the group\u2019s prior knowl-\nedge of and experience with e-learning. As one leader of a subject group said of his team: \nThey were very suspicious before they did the CARPE DIEM. I just wanted them to see what\ne-learning could do and they are now much more open to doing it. We are going ahead with\nour design in one of our modules. (P. Education)\nOne subject team expressed initial scepticism towards e-learning in general and about the\npossibility of designing for e-learning in their particular course. Following the workshop,\nthe team trialled their e-learning design with one group of postgraduate students, while\nkeeping their traditional distance learning design with another group. The team maintained\nthe designs developed in CARPE DIEM in subsequent iterations of their course and are in\nthe process of embedding e-tivities across other courses in the department, for which they\nhave requested help from BDRA. \n104  G. Salmon et al.\n\u2026e-learning has got the potential to make teaching better. I\u2019ve got some essays that have\njust come in from the [e-learning design] group and we see a greater maturity of understanding\nfrom that group than from the group that have approached it in a more traditional way.\n(R. Psychology)\nLeicester emphasises \u2018the student experience\u2019. Most subject team academics were unsure\nwhether or how this applied to them, but following CARPE DIEM they showed a greater\nawareness of students\u2019 needs, which they took into account in designing for e-learning. \n[CARPE DIEM] really got me to think \u2026 e-learning is more student-centred, doing e-learning\nis more thinking about the ways that students can approach the material. You know, you\u2019re a\nstudent and you\u2019re starting this activity, what are you going to do, how are you going to do it.\n(R Media Studies)\nI think two elements really; one was the sort of teaching technology we should use. So what\nwe were using and what we weren\u2019t using and where we could benefit from using [it]. Well\nus and the students could benefit from using it. So there was that kind of inspirational side\nof it but I think there was also that reflective side of it. So we were starting to think\nwell what do we want to try and achieve? We bounced a lot of ideas around and we\nmodified modules, we changed this, we changed that. But what CARPE DIEM allowed us\nto do as well was to answer well: what do we want people to be getting from this course?\n(R. Psychology)\nIn summary, academic course teams acknowledged the benefits arising from the team\napproach to course design that CARPE DIEM offered. They worked collegially and finished\nthe workshop with an increased understanding of pedagogy relevant to their disciplines.\nThey learned to make more effective use of VLE features in context and increased their\nunderstanding via purposeful, learner-centred and peer-reviewed e-tivities. Teams were\nwilling to try out the new designs in their teaching and felt confident about their ability to\ngenerate and integrate more e-tivities into their courses. Each of these aspects contributed\nto their capability building.\nPost CARPE DIEM workshops\nAfter the CARPE DIEM workshop, when the course teams took their designs back to their\ndepartments, their partnership with the ADELIE team continued formally and informally.\nFor example, the ADELIE team was asked to attend meetings with the course teams after a\ndesign had been implemented, to advise on adjustments.\nSome course teams needed additional support to embed their new designs into\nroutine departmental practices and assessment strategies. Several teams asked for further\nsessions or advice on designing for e-learning in their specific contexts. BDRA has\ncontinued to work closely with participating teams to help them incorporate and pilot\nchanges in design, and to encourage the cascading of these approaches to course design,\ninternally.\nParticipants reported \u2018a raised profile for e-learning in the department\u2019 and that \u2018e-learning\nis being written into [their] staff development plans\u2019. Another subject team developing a\nblended course for on-campus students reported plans to develop a further course for first-\nyear students. Other teams reported their intention to develop other courses or modules. While\nthese developments may be linked to a general shift towards acceptance of e-learning at\nLeicester, CARPE DIEM succeeded in putting the institutional e-learning strategy firmly on\nthe departments\u2019 agendas in a meaningful and practical way. \nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   105\nIn fact, this morning we just had another departmental meeting about webcams. There is a\nsmall group of us trying to take that forward as well. (P. Applied Linguistics)\nSome problems the course teams encountered in implementing their courses have wider\nimplications for the institution. For example, the teams found institutional and departmental\nallocations of teaching time for online courses challenging. \nWhat we need is ever greater commitment from each School to find more e-moderators.\n(L. Inter Professional Education)\nTo develop and implement further designs for the assessment of student performance,\nespecially in collaborative work, the subject teams need to challenge departmental and tradi-\ntional practices. \nThere may be difficulty in getting the department to agree really. Because people tend to be a\nbit uptight about external examiners. (I. Law)\nWe interpret these potential disturbances to the system in a positive way: academics are\nidentifying barriers to their capability building and setting a strategic agenda.\nResults\nCapability building\nThe intervention proved effective and appropriate in building capability in learner-centred\ne-learning design. Eighty-seven academics were involved in ADELIE. Many Leicester\nacademics found the e-tivities framework acceptable and relevant, and incorporated it into\nstudent learning. They confirmed that use of the VLE for learning activities is low-cost and\npopular with students if instructions are clear and feedback frequent, and e-tivities help to\nintegrate the VLE into the curriculum (Hall 2006).\nThose subject teams that did not implement their full design usually curtailed the provi-\nsion for participatory learning. Typically, these teams had not planned for the provision of\nteaching time to support online collaboration and maintenance of participative aspects of\ntheir design. As a consequence, they re-wrote e-tivities to dispense with discussion forums\nand other functionality that enabled students to share their work and their ideas. Provision\nfor participative learning implies the allocation of tutor time to e-moderate learners\u2019 input\nas an essential component of effective e-learning. The perceived increase in workload that\nmay occur as a result was a concern for most of the participating teams.\nImproved capability at the institutional level was revealed in the second benchmarking\nexercise. On a scale of 1.0 to 6.0, it showed increases in scores under the two key criteria:\n\u2018Instructional design\/pedagogy\u2019 increased from 2.0 in 2006 to 4.0 in 2007, and \u2018Learning\nmaterials\u2019 increased from 3.0 to 4.0 (see Table 1).\nParticular attention was paid during the intervention to building \u2018design teams\u2019, given the\nclimate for crossing barriers in the service of capability building for the future (Whitchurch\n2007). In half the subject teams, CARPE DIEM participants presented at the pre-meeting as\na \u2018team\u2019, with common goals, shared understanding and trust. They knew each other very\nwell and played to their strengths. The outputs at the end of the workshop were generally well\nadvanced as a result. The other teams were more heterogeneous. Some academics had been\ngiven the task of \u2018writing a module\u2019, with few or no links to the rest of the programme or\ntheir colleagues. In some cases, this job was offered to part-time lecturers, who were typically\n106  G. Salmon et al.\nless integrated into the team and more concerned than full-time staff about the allocation of\nhours available to design the course. One group included \u2018consultants\u2019 who were \u2018hired to\nwrite a module\u2019 and were not part of the department. In all of these cases, the CARPE DIEM\nprocess provided an opportunity to forge new and relevant relationships and to ensure the\nlearning programme had, at least, a shared mission and approach, but the intervention was\nnot by itself sufficient to transform the disparate groups into coherent teams.\nNo brand new subject teams were formed as a result of working through the CARPE\nDIEM process, but the data showed that participants behaved and designed differently after-\nwards. They shared more common ground than before in terms of design and pedagogy, and\nthey knew each other better. They were more aware of the importance of a team approach\nto course design, knew how pedagogical, technological and information specialists could\nhelp them at the early stages of design, had a better understanding of their departmental\nprogramme as a whole and of how various modules linked to each other. They understood\nhow, by designing better, they could make the programme more coherent, consistent, and\nparticipative and thus offer a better experience for their learners. This was a positive start to\ncapability building.\nThere was less success in integrating librarians into subject teams. Librarians attended\nthe CARPE DIEM workshops and productively contributed. They created e-tivities of their\nown, which were used either as part of the main team\u2019s design or within the Library\u2019s own\nresources. The Library is now considering an approach based on the CARPE DIEM model,\nto offer enhanced support to distance learners.\nLearning technologists, on the other hand, developed a lasting, context-sensitive link\nto each course team, which generated useful synergies for ongoing help, advice and\nengagement with departmental academic and support staff. Requests for help from learning\ntechnologists by academics have increased dramatically.\nDiscussion\nFurther capability building\nThe CARPE DIEM process may have begun the capability building that the ADELIE\nPathfinder project was seeking. There is acceptance of the process within the university.\nThe action research has enabled us to incorporate change in e-learning design into the\nuniversity\u2019s priorities. Beyond the university the CARPE DIEM process has demonstrated\nits usefulness and acceptability in the wider HE sector through further externally funded\nprojects and inter-institutional collaborative work.\nSmall subject teams, CARPE DIEM \u2018graduates\u2019, spread the word within their own\ndepartment. To date, seven departments have requested or received a second CARPE DIEM\nfor another module or programme and one department has received four. Encouragement to\napply for CARPE DIEM workshops across departments happens visibly within formal\ncommittee structures, through support from senior managers and resource-holders and\nthrough staff development activities. It is difficult to determine how much informal mention\noccurs but new lecturers, especially those with responsibility for teaching new courses,\napproach BDRA very quickly upon their appointment.\nIn 2008 a specialist distance learning (DL) unit associated with a new DL strategy is\nbeing set up to provide design and production help for subject teams who wish to undertake\ncurriculum design and delivery through distance learning. The strategy and resourcing\nincludes provision for CARPE DIEM workshops and design support.\nIn October 2007, BDRA started a 12-month Academy-funded research project called\nAssessment & Disciplines: Developing E-tivities Research (ADDER). ADDER focuses on\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   107\nthe work of the Re-Engineering Assessment Practices project (www.reap.ac.uk) and its key\nprinciples. BDRA is incorporating the latest research-into-practice approach to assessment\nand feedback into CARPE DIEM workshops thus demonstrating its ability to respond and\nadapt.\nEarly in 2008, the Academy-funded CHEETAH (Change by Embedding E-learning\nin Teaching Across HEIs) project began. The purpose of CHEETAH is to transfer the\nCARPE DIEM model to six partner institutions, to help them develop a fresh but sustain-\nable approach to capability building in e-learning design. CHEETAH is enabling BDRA\nto train more CARPE DIEM facilitators and will contribute to transferring and scaling up\nthe process. Through evaluation and feedback it will continue to build on and refine the\nCARPE DIEM design. As part of CHEETAH, collaboration with other Pathfinders has\nbegun.\nBy May 2008, 20 CARPE DIEM workshops had taken place at Leicester and 17 at other\nUK institutions; 300 staff, including course teams, subject librarians, learning technologists\nand staff developers had taken part.\nCritique and limitations\nThis paper has focused on CARPE DIEM workshops for capability building at Leicester\nand beyond. The e-learning strategy that provided a driving force for these developments is\nending its three-year cycle and is under review. The wide variety of small positive impacts\non staff capability may well ensure its continuation at Leicester, enabling BDRA to look at\ninstitutional-wide issues in the medium term. This paper does not report on the ongoing\nevaluation needed to establish the impact on student learning from the new designs, many\nof which are being delivered during 2008. Clearly this is a longer-term project and the\naction-research loops will gradually spiral wider as we obtain feedback from the students\nabout their experience. At present a staff member plays the role of na\u00efve user (called a \u2018real-\nity checker\u2019) and attends the second day of CARPE DIEM workshops to test the new online\ne-tivities and offer feedback to the design team. In future BDRA expects to offer this role\nto students to increase their involvement throughout the process\nConclusion\nThe CARPE DIEM process works well at Leicester, having resulted in documented exam-\nples of improved course design and implementation. The model is stable and adaptable\nenough to accommodate new priorities and a wide variety of disciplines. It builds teams\nwithin and across professional groups and it offers a capability building route for e-learning\ndesign.\nThe CARPE DIEM model is currently being successfully transferred to other HEIs that\nare learning from each other. Further research will establish whether the model makes a\ngreater or lesser contribution to capability building in universities with cultures, structures\nor priorities that differ from Leicester\u2019s. However, initial soundings from the ADDER and\nCHEETAH projects, involving CARPE DIEM processes with 14 course teams at 10 HEIs,\nare very encouraging.\nAs the use of VLEs changes to accommodate a much wider range of personalised\ntechnologies, so the nature of e-tivities designed within CARPE DIEM workshops may\nalter. BDRA expects that the basic premise and principles of this intervention will take it\ninto capability building for the longer term. If others try out the CARPE DIEM model,\nplease report back.\n108  G.
