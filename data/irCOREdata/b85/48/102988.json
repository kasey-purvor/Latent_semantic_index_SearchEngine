The quantity of the grafted polymer can be easily controlled\nby the feed ratio of monomers. As a typical example, the polyurea-functionalized MWNTs were measured\nand characterized in detail. The oxidized MWNTs (MWNT-COOH) were converted into acyl chloride-\nfunctionalized MWNTs (MWNT-COCl) by reaction with neat thionyl chloride (SOCl2). MWNT-COCl was\nreacted with excess 1,6-diaminohexane, affording amino-functionalized MWNTs (MWNT-NH2). In the presence\nof MWNT-NH2, the polyurea was covalently coated onto the surfaces of the nanotube by in situ\npolycondensation of diisocyanate [e.g., 4,4\u2032-methylenebis(phenylisocyanate)] and 1,6-diaminohexane, followed\nby the removal of free polymer via repeated filtering and solvent washing. The coated polyurea content can\nbe controlled to some extent by adjusting the feed ratio of the isocyanato and amino groups. The structure\nand morphology of the resulting nanocomposites were characterized by FTIR, NMR, Raman, confocal Raman,\nTEM, EDS, and SEM measurements. The polyurea-coated MWNTs showed interesting self-assembled flat-\nor flowerlike morphologies in the solid state. The signals corresponding to that of the D and G bands of the\ncarbon nanotubes were strongly attenuated after polyurea was chemically tethered to the MWNT surfaces.\nComparative experiments showed that the grafted polymer species and structures have a strong effect on the\nRaman signals of polymer-functionalized MWNTs.\nIntroduction\nFunctionalization or modification of nanosurfaces has un-\nlocked a new era in the development and applications of hybrid\nnanomaterials.1 Binding polymers to carbon nanotubes (CNTs)2\npromises to be one of the most intriguing prospects in this\ntechnology because the individual properties of the two materials\ncan be combined to give one novel hybrid nanomaterial with\ngood mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, and\nexcellent processing ability.3 This can be generally achieved\nby the grafting to4 and grafting from3,5 approaches. The former\ninvolves direct reaction of existing polymers containing terminal\nfunctional groups (e.g., -OH and -NH2) with the anterior\nfunctional groups (e.g., -COOH and -COCl) on CNTs, either\nin solution or by melt-compounding.4,6 The apparent limitation\nof the grafting to approach lies in the specific requirement of\nthe polymer terminal functional groups, the low grafting density,\nand the limited control over the grafted polymer content. The\ngrafting from approach, involving in situ polymerization of\nmonomers from CNT-supported macroinitiators, overcomes\nmost of these shortcomings. However, it is limited only to vinyl\nand cyclic monomers (or living polymerization-active mono-\nmers). Therefore, it is still a big challenge for relevant scientists\nand engineers to functionalize CNTs in a simple, controllable\nmanner with polycondensed polymers from corresponding\nmonomers, instead of specific macromolecules possessing\nterminal functional groups.\nIn this work, we present an in situ polycondensation approach,\nbonding linear polyurea, polyurethane, and hyperbranched poly-\n(urea-urethane) on amino-functionalized MWNTs (MWNT-\nNH2) from commercially available polycondensation-type mono-\nmers. Our methodology can be regarded as a combination of\ngrafting to and grafting from approaches because the monomers\ncan grow from the tube surface, and the in situ formed oligomers\nand macromolecules can also synchronously couple with the\ntubes. This approach would pave the way for the functional-\nization of carbon nanotubes with polycondensed polymeric\nengineering plastics.\n* Corresponding author.

Moreover, after the polyurea was\ncovalently grafted onto the tube surfaces, the D and G bands\nassigned to MWNTs were strongly attenuated, as confirmed by\nboth general and confocal Raman spectroscopy measurements.\nThis is possibly attributed to the energy transfer between the\ncoated polyurea and the tubes.\nExperimental Procedures\nMaterials. The CVD-MWNTs used in this work were\npurchased from Tsinghua-Nafine Nano-Powder Commercializa-\ntion Engineering Centre in Beijing; the purity is higher than\n95%. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2), diisocyanates, diamines, diols,\nand diethanolamine were obtained from Aldrich and used as\nreceived.\nInstrumentation. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra\nwere recorded on a PE Paragon 1000 spectrometer. Hydrogen\nnuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were measured\nwith a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer. Transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM) studies were performed on either a Hitachi\nH7100 electron microscope operating at 100 kV or a JEOL JEM\n2200FS electron microscope (equipped with a JEOL energy\ndispersive spectrometer (EDS)) operating at 200 kV, respec-\ntively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were\nrecorded using a LEO 1530-CBW field-emission microscope,\nand the samples were precoated with a homogeneous gold layer\nby sputtering technology. Raman spectra were recorded on a\nLabRam-1B Raman spectroscope excited at 514.5 nm. Confocal\nRaman spectra and images were measured and obtained by He-\nNe laser excitation at 632.8 nm with an excitation density of\nabout 250 kW\/cm2. Molecular weights were measured by gel\npermeation chromatography (GPC) using PE Series 200 with\nPS as the standard and DMF\/LiBr as the eluent. Thermal\ngravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a PE TGA-7\ninstrument at a heating rate of 20 \u00b0C\/min in a nitrogen flow\n(10 mL\/min).\nAcid Treatment of MWNTs.3 Typically, 12.0 g of crude\nMWNTs, 100 mL of 60% HNO3, and 300 mL of 98% H2SO4\nwas added into a 1000 mL flask equipped with a condenser\nwith vigorous stirring. The flask was then immersed in a\nsonication bath (40 kHz) for 10 min. The mixture was then\nstirred for 100 min under reflux (90-133 \u00b0C). During this\nperiod, dense brown gas was collected and treated with a NaOH\naqueous solution connected to the condenser by a plastic tube.\nAfter cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was\ndiluted with 500 mL of deionized water and then vacuum-\nfiltered through a filter paper (Fischer). The solid was dispersed\nin 500 mL of water and filtered again, and then 200 mL of\nwater was used to wash the filtrate several times. The dispersion,\nfiltering, and washing steps were repeated until the pH of the\nfiltrate reached 7 (at least four cycles were required). The filtered\nsolid was then washed with ca. 200 mL of acetone and THF 5\ntimes to remove most of the water from the sample and dried\nunder vacuum for 24 h at 60 \u00b0C, giving 7.2 g (\u001860% yield\nwith the whole added crude MWNTs, 12 g, as the reference).\nSynthesis of MWNT-NH2.7,8 Amino group functionalized\nMWNTs were synthesized as follows. The as-prepared MWNT-\nCOOH was reacted with excess neat SOCl2 for 24 h under\nreflux, and then the residual SOCl2 was removed by reduced-\npressure distillation equipped with a liquid nitrogen trap, giving\nacyl chloride-functionalized MWNTs (MWNT-COCl). The as-\nproduced MWNT-COCl, without further purification and other\ntreatments, was immediately reacted with excess 1,6-diamino-\nhexane at 20-25 \u00b0C for 24 h and then at 65-75 \u00b0C for 24 h in\nthe presence of triethylamine and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine,\nobtaining amino-functionalized MWNTs (MWNT-NH2) after\nrepeated filtration, washing, and vacuum-drying. The product\ncontained ca. 0.93 mmol of amino groups per g of carbon\ncalculated from TGA data (ca. 12% weight loss).

Typically (NTPU3 Table\n1), MWNT-NH2 (91 mg) and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc,\n50 mL) were placed in a flask that was immersed in an ice\/\nwater bath. With stirring, 4,4\u2032-methylenebis(phenylisocyanate)\n(MDI, 1.109 g) was added to the flask. The temperature was\nmaintained at 0-5 \u00b0C for 4 h and 40 \u00b0C for 24 h and then\nsubsequently reduced to 0-5 \u00b0C. Then, 1,6-diminohexane (0.515\ng) was added, whereupon the viscosity of the mixture increased\ndramatically. The mixture was maintained at 0-5 \u00b0C for 5 h,\nfollowed by room temperature (18-25 \u00b0C) for 24 h. DMAc\n(150 mL) was added to the flask to dilute the reaction mixture.\nAfter vacuum filtering, efficient washing with DMAc, redis-\npersing in DMAc, and precipitating by the addition of THF,\nsubsequent filtering, and freeze-drying, as treated in the grafting\nfrom approach,7 270 mg of gray polyurea-coated MWNTs\n(NTPU3) was obtained. TGA measurements showed that the\ngrafted polymer weight proportion (fwt%) was 72%.\nMixing of MWNT-NH2 with Polyurea and Removal of\nPolyurea. To confirm that the ungrafted polymer can be\nefficiently removed from the MWNT-polyurea product by\nfiltering and washing, the parallel experiment was done as\nfollows. A total of 40 mg of MWNT-NH2 and 400 mg of\npolyurea (Mn ) 8500, PDI ) 3.4) in 20 mL of DMAc was\nadded to a 50 mL flask. The mixture was stirred for 24 h at\nroom temperature. The solid product was collected after 4 times\nof repeated filtering, washing with DMAc, and redispersing in\nDMA and then was vacuum-dried, as treated in the synthesis\nof MWNT-polyurea. TGA measurements showed that the\nadsorbed polymer content is lower than 4 wt %.\nResults and Discussion\nSynthesis and Characterization of MWNT-Polyurea. The\nin situ polycondensation approach to functionalization of CNTs\nis schematically shown in Figure 1. To confirm the generality\nand versatility of this approach, we employed MDI or 1,6-\ndiisocyanatohexane (HDI) to react with various diamines (H2N-\n(CH2)nNH2, n ) 2, 4, 6) or diols (HO(CH2)nOH, n ) 2, 4, 6),\ngrowing a series of polycondensed polymers onto MWNTs (see\nFigure 1A). Significantly, if diethanolamine was reacted with\nMDI or other diisocyanates, multihydroxy hyperbranched poly-\n(urea-urethane)s would be covalently tethered onto MWNT\nsurfaces without gelation.9 Such molecular nanohybrids associ-\nated with plenty of hydroxyl groups on the tube periphery will\nTABLE 1: Functionalization of MWNTs with Polyurea by\nIn Situ Polycondensation of MDI and 1,6-Diaminohexane\ncode Rfeed fwt% thickness (nm)a Mnb PDI\nNTPU1 1:0.95 30 2.8 1500 8.1\nNTPU2 1:0.98 50 5.3 3600 6.5\nNTPU3 1:1.0 72 7.5 8500 3.4\na The average thickness of the coated polymer layer detected by\nTEM. b The number-average molecular weight of the polyurea col-\nlected from the reaction solution, measured by GPC with DMF\/LiBr\nas eluent.\n11926 J. Phys. Chem. B, Vol. 109, No. 24, 2005 Gao et al.\nhave applications in nanoengineering and nanofabrication,\nespecially for templating and further functionlization.10 In this\npaper, we focus on the preparation and characterization of\nMWNT-polyurea nanohybrids. The corresponding reaction\nconditions and selected results for the polycondensation of MDI\nand 1,6-diminohexane are summarized in Table 1. The chemical\nstructure of the resulting nanohybrids is schematically illustrated\nin Figure 1B.\nIt is generally accepted that in polycondensation processes,\nthe resulting molecular weight (MW) of the polymer depends\nmainly on the molar feed ratio of the reactive functional groups.\nHence, we engineered our experiment to control the MW or\nfwt% of polyurea by adjusting the feed ratio of isocyanato\/amino\ngroups (Rfeed). Indeed, fwt%, calculated from TGA weight loss\ncurves (see Figure 2), can be well-controlled by adjusting the\nRfeed. Moreover, the greater the fwt%, the higher the MW of the\nungrafted polyurea collected from the solution.11 From the TGA\ncurves, we can also see that the decomposition temperature (Td)\nof the grafted polyurea increases with increasing grafted content.\nThis is in accordance with the MW increasing tendency.\nIt was noteworthy that the adsorbed polyurea can be ef-\nficiently removed from the products by filtration and washing\nas mentioned in the Experimental Procedures. The parallel\nexperiment, in which MWNT-NH2 was mixed with free\npolyurea in DMAc solvent followed by efficient filtration and\nwashing, proved that the adsorbed polyurea quantity was lower\nthan 4 wt %. Furthermore, NMR measurement for the upper\nlayer of DMSO-d6 solution, collected by centrifuging (2 h at a\nrate of 6000 rpm) of NTPU3 dispersed in the DMSO-d6, showed\nthat no polyurea signals appeared in the spectrum. This further\nindicated that the adsorbed polymer quantity was negligible.\nTherefore, the in situ polycondensation approach presented here\npromised the grafting of polycondensed polymers onto CNT\nsurfaces with some extent of control. Although the CNTs\/\npolymer composites have also been reported to be made by in\nsitu polymerization of monomers in the presence of CNTs, the\ngrafted-polymer proportion on the tubes was rarely measured\nby separation of polymer-grafted CNTs from the as-prepared\ncomposite mixture.12 Thus, the covalent grafting efficiency and\ncapacity of this method were rarely evaluated previously.\nThe molecular composition of the resulting MWNT-polyurea\nnanohybrids was confirmed by FTIR and 1H NMR measure-\nments.13 For NTPU1-3, the characteristic absoption peaks of\npolyurea such as -NHCONH-, -HNCONH-, and -CH2- clearly\nappeared at 1639, 3320, and 2930\/2853 cm-1, respectively. The\nbenzene-ring CdC absorption peak of polyurea made with MDI\nat ca. 1600 cm-1 was overshadowed by that of amido groups\nat 1565 cm-1, while the corresponding peak at 1480 cm-1 was\nvery strong (see Figure 3). The greater the grafted amount, the\nstronger the absorption peaks.\nPolymer-functionalized CNTs would show much higher\nsolubility or better dispersibility as compared with pristine\nnanotubes. Herein, as polyurea is polar, our resulting samples\nof MWNT-polyurea are readily dispersed in polar organic\nsolvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethyl-\nformamide (DMF), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), and DMAc.\nStructure and Morphology of the Resulting MWNT-\nPolyurea Molecular Nanocomposites. The fine nanostructures\nof the as-prepared CNT-polyurea nanocomposites were inves-\ntigated by TEM. As shown in Figure 4A-D, a core-shell\nstructure with MWNTs at the center can be clearly observed\nfor the nanocomposites, indicating that the MWNTs were coated\nby a layer of polymer chains.3,14 From the TEM images of the\nNTPU3-NTPU1 samples, we can clearly discern that the higher\nthe quantity of the grafted polymer, the thicker the polymer\nshell. Such a core-shell structure can be called a molecular\nnanocomposite because of a covalent linkage between the core\nand the shell. As a comparison, such core-shell structures were\nnot found for the MWNTs\/polyurea mixtures. For the crude\nMWNTs, the tube surface is relatively smooth and clean (Figure\n4E), obviously different from that of the polymer-functionalized\nMWNTs.\nEDS elemental measurements that enable us to detect the\nelemental contents were conducted for the CNT-polyurea\nnanohybrids as a support for the TEM results. Nevertheless,\nEDS mapping analyses require sufficient EDS scan cycles (five\nto ten cycles are generally needed, depending on the specifically\ndetectable X-ray intensity eradiated from the sample) to produce\nFigure 1. Schematic illustration for the functionalization of carbon\nnanotubes by the in situ polycondensation approach (A) and the\nchemical structure of the MWNT-polyurea made from MDI and 1,6-\ndiaminohexane (B).\nFigure 2.

The highly focused electron beam used in\nthe EDS analyze can distort or even damage the polyurea-\nfunctionalized CNTs, possibily due to the combination of\nelectron beam irradiation effects and the in situ generated\nnitrogen and oxygen radicals from the decomposition of the\ncoated polyurea. For the tubes coated with higher amounts of\npolyurea, only a subsequent EDS scan during mapping analysis\nwould destroy or distort the tubes. Hence, it is very difficult to\ncollect the reliable EDS mapping profile for such tubes, although\na significant amount of attempts was made. Figure 5 displays\nthe EDS mapping results of a chosen tube with a thin polymer\nlayer. The straight tube (Figure 5A) was irradiated into a twisted\nand swollen one (Figure 5B) after five cycles of EDS scanning.\nThe line-scan elemental analysis (Figure 5C), obtained from\nthe section analysis on part of the tube (marked as green lines\nin Figure 5B), indicates that the sample contains carbon (C),\nnitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) elements. The intensity of the\nnitrogen element is obviously higher than that of oxygen, which\nis in agreement with the composition of polyurea made from\nMDI and 1,6-diminohexane (the mole ratio of nitrogen to\noxygen is ca. 2:1 for the neat polyurea). The mapping results\n(Figure 5D-F) show that the dispersions of carbon, nitrogen,\nand oxygen elements conform well with the shape of the\npolymer-grafted carbon nanotube.\nThe morphology of the resulting MWNT-polyurea nanocom-\nposites was observed with SEM (see Figure 6). The nanocom-\nposites showed behavior associated with self-assembly, par-\nticularly in the case of MWNTs bonded with high quantities of\npolyurea, which resulted in leaf-, flat-, and flowerlike structures.\nFor NTPU1 with 30 wt % of polyurea, the rodlike structures7,14\nand an organization tendency can be clearly observed (Figure\n6B), as compared with the crude MWNTs (Figure 6A). A few\nhybrids were assembled together along the tube axes, generating\nregular hollow grooved flat-structures (Figure 6C). With\nFigure 4.

B, Vol. 109, No. 24, 2005 Gao et al.\nincreasing polyurea content, most of the functionalized tubes\nappear to form arc-, flat-, and flowerlike structures (Figure\n6D,E). Figure 6F displays a section of a self-assembled flat\nstructures, in which the functionalized nanotubes are aligned\nand organized parallel. One tube, not included totally in the\naggregate, is clearly presented. It is evidently thicker than crude\ntubes because of the polymer coating. The sample of NTPU3\nwith 72% polyurea resulted in beautiful \u00edm scale roselike\nflowers constructed from individual MWNT-polyurea molecular\nhybrids (Figure 6G,H). Precipitation appears to provide the\nimpetus for this self-assembly process because these structures\nwere destroyed when solvent was added (Figure 6I), but the\nstructures were reformed by adding the nanohybrid DMF\nsolution to THF. Phase separation, macromolecular chain\nentanglement, and other interactions during the precipitation,\nwith the support of stiff tube bars, can favor this organization\nof nanostructures.15 Further detailed study of the self-assembly\nmechanism and the parameters governing these processes are\nin progress.\nRaman Spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful\ntool used to characterize the functionalized CNTs. As shown\nin Figure 7 (514.5 nm excitation), the D- and G-bands of\nMWNTs at ca. 1350 and 1582 cm-1, attributed to the defects\nand disorder-induced modes and in-plane E2g zone-center mode,\nare clearly observed for both crude MWNTs and some func-\ntionalized MWNTs (MWNT-COOH and MWNT-NH2).16 The\nD- to G-band intensity ratios (ID\/IG) for MWNT-COOH and\nMWNT-NH2 are ca. 1.11 and 1.09, respectively. These ratios\nare greater than that of pristine MWNTs (ca. 0.81). In addition,\nthe D\u2032-band at 1617 cm-1, which is known to be directly affected\nby the disorder in nanotubes, also exhibits different relative\nintensities for pristine and modified MWNTs. This band can\nbe barely observable in pristine tubes but is clearly detectable\nafter functionalization, indicating an increase in defects along\nthe tube body.16 For NTPU1, the D- and G-bands are also clearly\nobserved (Figure 7A, spectrum 4), but the relative peak intensity\nis lower than that of MWNT-NH2. Significantly, all these\ncharacteristic absorption peaks were strongly attenuated or\nalmost disappeared after a high amount of polyurea was tethered\nto the surfaces of MWNTs for NTPU3 (Figure 7A, spectrum\n5). Furthermore, the Raman signals assigned to pure polyurea\nwere not found in the spectrum of NTPU3 either.\nTo explore the novel phenomenon aforementioned, we\nmeasured Raman spectra of the mechanical mixtures of MWNTs\nand polyurea with different polyurea contents (Figure 7B). The\nRaman signals of the mechanical mixture with 30 wt % of\npolyurea were similar to those of crude MWNTs, and the D-\nand G-bands appeared at 1350 and 1581 cm-1, respectively.\nFor the mixture with 72 wt % content of polyurea, both nanotube\nand polyurea signals were observed (the CNT bands blue-shifted\nby about 7-10 wavenumbers). This is significantly different\nfrom the Raman signals of NTPU3, although the polyurea\nfraction in the composites is the same (72%), which suggests\nthat the polymer-grafted CNTs are completely different from\nFigure 6.

Phys. Chem. B, Vol. 109, No. 24, 2005 11929\nCNTs\/polymer mixtures in terms of Raman characteristics. For\nthe covalently functionalized CNTs, the polymer is individually\nanchored to the tube surface, forming a nanoscale (ca. 2-15\nnm, dependent on polymer amount) layer of coverage, especially\nin the cases of higher grafting-polymer proportions. Such\ncoverage may lead to three different phenomena in the Raman\nmeasurements: (1) only CNT signals are detectable if the\npolymer layer is transparent, (2) only polymer signals are present\nif the polymer layer can absorb and reflect the whole excited\nenergy, and (3) no signals or strong photoluminescence can be\nobserved if there is energy transfer between nanotubes and\npolymer chains or if the coated polymer makes the electronic\nproperty of CNTs changed. The covered polymer layer that is\nonly a few nanometers thick forms noncontinuous structures\nas a result of random defects on the tube surface. This makes\nit difficult or even impossible to totally absorb and reflect all\nthe excited energy for the polymer phase. Therefore, the Raman\nsignals of polymer chains are difficult to detect if the polymer\nis tethered to the nanotubes, and generally, only the CNT signals\nare found. By contrast, because the two macroscopic phases of\nCNTs and polymers exist individually in the mechanical\nmixture, the Raman signals of both components can be observed.\nAnother possible explanation for the reduced Raman signal\nof the polymer-grafted CNTs is the low CNT content. To\neliminate this query, we covalently grafted other polymers, such\nas polystyrene (PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),\nonto the tube surfaces with different polymer contents (regarding\nhow to covalently grow PMMA or PS on the MWNT surfaces\nto prepare MWNT-PMMA or MWNT-PS, see the previous\nreferences3a,7), to investigate the effects of polymer proportions\non the Raman signals of nanocomposites. It was found that the\npolymer content has almost no influence on the Raman signal\nintensity of CNTs. Strong D- and G-bands of CNTs were\nobserved, while the samples with a polymer fraction were as\nhigh as 80-85 wt % (note: this value is much higher than that\nof NTPU3, 72%) (see Figure 7C).17 The polymer signals were\nnot found yet, and the D\u2032-band was relatively stronger than that\nof pristine CNTs. On the other hand, the query of chemical\nmodification destroying the CNT structure can be also excluded\nbecause the same batch of MWNT-COOH was employed as\nthe material for all the CNT-polymer samples. Therefore, the\nRaman signal decrease of CNTs for the samples of MWNT-\npolyurea (especially for NTPU3) was not caused by either the\nlow content of CNT or the nontransparence of polyurea but was\npossiblly due to the energy transfer between CNTs and polyurea\nor the grafted polymer influence on the electronic properties of\nCNTs. A possible application of this phenomenon is the\nfabrication of luminescent\/energy-absorption materials and\ndevices.\nThese results were further confirmed by confocal Raman\nspectroscopy (He-Ne laser at 632.8 nm, an excitation density\nof about 250 kW\/cm2) (see Figure 8). For NTPU1, distinct\nfluorescence background appeared in the Raman spectrum\n(Figure 8A), and it gradually became weaker as the irradiation\ntime was increased from 10 to 400 s. In the same spectrum,\ntwo peaks at 1291.3 and 1548.9 cm-1 were observed, which\ncan be assigned to the D- and G-bands of CNTs with significant\nred shifts of 60 and 32 cm-1, respectively. In the Raman\nspectrum of NTPU3 (Figure 8B), the fluorescence background\nwas also observed, and it also decreased with increasing\nirradiation time. However, the D- and G-bands of CNTs were\ntoo small to be clearly detected for NTPU3. As a comparison,\nthe D- and G-bands of CNTs for the crude MWNTs (Figure\n8C) and MWNT-PS (Figure 8D) or MWNT-PMMA (the\nspectrum was not shown here) were very strong, and almost no\nfluorescence background was found. The confocal Raman results\nare in accordance with those of the bulk Raman measurements.\nThis provides us with the following conclusions: (1) the Raman\nsignal of polymer-functionalized MWNTs is strongly dependent\non the grafted polymer species and their structures, (2) the\neffects of polymer content on the Raman signals of function-\nalized nanotubes are inconclusive: strong in some cases, while\nneglectable for others, and (3) if a high content of polymer has\naffected the Raman signals, it is not because the CNTs content\nis too low to be detected but because the tubes are wrapped by\nthe polymer chains that may result in energy transfer between\ntubes and polymers.\nSun et al.4,18 reported the fluorescence emission phenomenon\nof polymer-functionalized CNTs during Raman measurements.\nOn the basis of their experiments and results, they concluded\nthat the luminescence interference is dependent on the dispersion\nFigure 7.

Herein, we further\nrevealed that the Raman signals of functionalized CNTs are\nstrongly dependent on the given polymers and their structures.\nHowever, detailed studies are needed to fully understand the\neffect of polymer coating on CNTs in terms of Raman spectra\nand the possible energy transferring mechanism.\nConclusions\nMWNTs were covalently functionalized with polyureas by\nthe in situ polycondensation strategy. The grafted polymer\ncontent can be controlled by adjusting the feed ratio of\npolycondensation-type monomers. Furthermore, this approach\ncan be easily extended to other polycondensation systems,\nbinding polycondensation-type polymers such as polyurethane,\npolyamide, and polyester to the carbon nanotube surfaces. The\nsimplicity and versatility of this approach open new avenues\nfor the functionalization and application of nanomaterials and\nnanocomposites. Core-shell nanostructures can be observed by\nTEM, indicating that the polymer chains are evenly grafted onto\nthe tubes. The polyurea-coated MWNTs can self-assemble into\narc-, flat-, or rose flowerlike structures, which probably provide\na new element for supramolecular chemistry. Moreover, the\nRaman signals of CNTs were strongly weakened after the\npolyurea was coated onto the carbon nanotubes. Comparison\nexperiments and confocal Raman scpectroscopy measurements\nindicated that the Raman signals of polymer-functionalized\nCNTs are essentially dependent on the given polymer species\nand their structures but not the polymer content.\nAcknowledgment.
