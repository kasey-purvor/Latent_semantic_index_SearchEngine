Introduction\n[2] During geomagnetic storms the flux of relativistic\nelectrons >1 MeV in the Van Allen radiation belts can vary\nby up to five orders of magnitude. These variations are\nhazardous to satellites as they can result in malfunctions,\nand in extreme cases total loss resulting in insurance claims\nof hundreds of millions of dollars [Baker et al., 1998].\nPrecipitation from the radiation belts also depletes ozone\n[Thorne, 1977] which may affect climate [e.g., Rozanov et\nal., 2005].\n[3] During the main phase of geomagnetic storms rapid\nreductions or \u2018drop-outs\u2019 in the relativistic electron flux may\noccur for 10 hours or more [Onsager et al., 2002]. These\ndrop-outs may be partly due to adiabatic transport effects\n[Kim and Chan, 1997] but since this process is reversible it\ndoes not explain storm time variations [Reeves et al., 2003].\nAlternatively, losses could be due to rapid outward electron\ntransport [Shprits et al., 2006] or enhanced precipitation\ninto the atmosphere due to wave-particle interactions [e.g.,\nMillan and Thorne, 2007]. Recent calculations suggest that\nthe radiation belt could be depleted on timescales of 1 hour\nor so [Selesnick, 2006], although data suggests a much\nlonger timescale for electron loss >800 keV (C. J. Rodger et\nal., Use of POES SEM-2 observations to examine radiation\nbelt dynamics and energetic electron precipitation into the\natmosphere, submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research,\n2009). While it is almost impossible to measure the\nprecipitating flux near the magnetic equator due to the\nsmallness of the loss cone, recently it has been shown that\nthe low altitude Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites\n(POES) can measure the trapped and precipitating electron\nflux at energies >1 MeV [Sandanger et al., 2009]. Here we\nutilize this new development to determine the global extent\nof electron precipitation >300 keV and >1 MeV during the\ndifferent phases of geomagnetic storms.\n2. Storm Time Variations\n[4] We used the Dst index to define geomagnetic storms\nsince it has a well defined signature [Gonzalez et al., 1994].\nDst is a measure of the electrical current systems, such as\nthe ring current and magnetopause currents, that develop\nduring a magnetic storm. We used a 12 hour running mean\nof the hourly Dst index to smooth the data and identified\nstorms for Dst \u0002 \u000370 nT, which corresponds to moderate to\nstrong storms or larger [Loewe and Pro\u00a8lss, 1997]. From the\nminimum Dst we tracked back in time to find when Dst\ndropped below \u000335 nT and forwards in time to find when\nDst rose above \u000335 nT. These values were used to define\nthe main and recovery phase, respectively. The pre-storm\nperiod was defined as 24 hours before Dst first dropped\nbelow \u000335 nT, and provided there was no storm in the\nprevious 48 hours. The procedure was carried out for the\nperiod 1998 to 2007, corresponding to when the NOAA 15,\n16, 17 and 18 satellites were operating with a new generation\nof particle detector. 69 storms were identified.\n[5] This method omits a very important class of weak\nlong duration storms associated with co-rotating interaction\n(CIR) regions in the solar wind [Tsurutani et al., 2006].\nThey usually have a minimum Dst > \u000375 nT and will be\ntreated separately elsewhere.\n[6] Data from the medium energy proton and electron\ndetector (MEPED) on NOAA 15, 16, 17 and 18 were used\nin our analysis. The satellites are in a low altitude (815 km)\nsun synchronous polar orbit with a period of approximately\n100 minutes. MEPED includes two solid state detectors,\none pointing radially outwards along the Earth satellite\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 36, L19104, doi:10.1029\/2009GL040236, 2009\n1British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\n2Also at Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering,\nUniversity of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.\n3Space Weather Prediction Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/09\/2009GL040236\nL19104 1 of 4\ndirection, (0\u0002 detector), and the other at 90\u0002 to this direction,\nantiparallel to the spacecraft velocity. Since the opening\nangle is \u00b115\u0002, the 0\u0002 detector measures the precipitating flux\ninside the bounce loss cone for approximately L \u0004 1.4\n(Rodger et al., submitted manuscript, 2009) while the 90\u0002\ndetector measures the trapped electron flux. Data from the\n>6.9 MeV proton channel was used to measure >1 MeV\nelectrons [see Sandanger et al., 2009] together with the >30,\n>100 and >300 keV electron channels. Data collected\nduring solar proton events were omitted and corrections to\nremove other proton contamination were applied (for more\ndetails see M. M. Lam et al. (Origin of energetic electron\nprecipitation >30 keV into the atmosphere, submitted to\nJournal of Geophysical Research, 2009)). The data were\ncollected into bins of 1 hour in magnetic local time (MLT)\nand 1\u0002 magnetic latitude according to the phase of each\nmagnetic storm.\n[7] Figure 1 shows the >1 MeV electron flux in the\nsouthern hemisphere for different phases of magnetic\nstorms. The trapped flux (left column) decreases during\nthe main phase at all local times and then increases in the\nrecovery phase above the pre-storm level. The flux does not\nshow any significant variation with MLT which suggests\nthat there is no localized rapid loss (or acceleration) process\noperating on timescales less than the drift time. Although\nthere is a decrease in flux during the main phase, by about a\nfactor of 2, the drop-out is not a strong feature (bottom left).\nLarge flux drop outs often occur during CIR driven storms\n[Borovsky and Denton, 2009] and other individual CME\ndriven storms [e.g., Brautigam and Albert, 2000] but is not\nso apparent here due to the averaging process. On average\nthere is a net increase in >1 MeV trapped electron flux\nassociated with magnetic storms.\n[8] In contrast to the trapped flux the precipitating flux\n(right column) remains almost the same during the pre-\nstorm and main phase. The data show little or no evidence\nthat the reduction in the trapped flux during the main phase\nis due to precipitation into the atmosphere. Instead precipita-\ntion increases during the recovery phase, which is surprising\nsince this is when the trapped flux is generally increasing. The\nprecipitating flux is more than an order of magnitude less than\nthe trapped flux which suggests weak diffusion into the loss\ncone on average, although strong diffusion may occur locally\nfor limited MLT.\n[9] This behavior in the MeV electron flux is different to\nthat at lower energies. Figure 2 shows that there is very little\nvariation in the trapped flux >300 keV between the pre-\nstorm and main phase. The trapped flux increases during the\nrecovery phase, mainly at lower magnetic latitudes (bottom\nleft panel), and there is no marked asymmetry in MLT. This\nis consistent with inward radial diffusion and gradient and\ncurvature drift around the Earth at these energies. However,\nthe precipitating flux >300 keV increases significantly\nFigure 1. (left) Trapped and (right) precipitating electron\nflux >1 MeV in the Southern hemisphere as a function of\nMLT and magnetic latitude for (a and e) pre-storm, (b and f)\nmain, and (c and g) recovery storm phase and (d and h)\naveraged over MLT.\nFigure 2.

The ratio of the precipitating to trapped\nflux is highest during the main phase and depends on\nlatitude.\n3. South Atlantic Anomaly\n[10] The data raise questions as to why electron precip-\nitation >300 keV peaks during storm main phase while that\n>1 MeV peaks during the recovery phase, and whether there\nis an important different in the wave-particle interactions\nresponsible?\n[11] In the southern hemisphere there is a weakness in the\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field known as the south Atlantic Anomaly\n(SAA). Data at low L, corresponding to the inner radiation\nbelt, is contaminated by protons in the SAA region but the\nweakness extends poleward over the outer radiation belt\nwhere contamination is not an issue. Figure 3 shows\nthat precipitation >1 MeV during the recovery phase is\nsignificantly higher over the Antarctic peninsular region,\npoleward of the SAA and corresponding to the outer\nradiation belt. There is very little precipitation at other\nlongitudes, or into the northern hemisphere (similarly for\nthe main phase, not shown). Conversely, during the main\nphase electron precipitation >300 keV is not restricted\npoleward of the SAA region, but can occur at all geographic\nlongitudes (Figure 4, and similarly for the recovery phase,\nnot shown). Furthermore, precipitation into the northern\nhemisphere is almost as strong as that into the southern\nhemisphere.\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\n[12] The fact that >300 keV precipitation can occur at all\ngeographic longitudes suggests that pitch angle scattering is\nstrong enough to scatter electrons into the bounce loss cone\nand cause precipitation at any longitude. One consequence\nof this is that the distribution of >300 keV precipitation in\nFigure 2 is more likely to show where pitch angle scattering\nof >300 keV electrons takes place in MLT. Waves respon-\nsible for pitch angle scattering MeV electrons, even if they\nare restricted in MLT, may also facilitate precipitation of\n300 keV electrons [Shprits et al., 2009]. However, the\nfact that precipitation >1 MeV is restricted in geographic\nlongitude suggests that >1 MeV electrons are mainly\nscattered into the drift loss cone and drift around the Earth\nto the SAA where they are lost to the atmosphere. Thus we\nsuggest that the MLT distribution of >1 MeV precipitation\n(Figure 1g) indicates where the SAA is in relation to MLT\nrather than the presence of strong wave-particle interactions\nat that location.\n[13] The question arises as to whether the waves respon-\nsible for precipitating >300 keV electrons also precipitate\n>1 MeV electrons? We argue that this is unlikely. Whistler\nmode chorus waves are one of the strongest candidates for\nprecipitating 10 keV to a few MeV electrons since they can\nresonate with electrons over this energy range [Horne et al.,\n2005]. Pitch angle diffusion into the loss cone becomes less\neffective at higher energies. Consequently diffusion into the\nloss cone is very small at \u00051 MeV and the waves are more\neffective at accelerating trapped electrons at high energies\n[Horne et al., 2005; Shprits et al., 2006; Varotsou et al.,\n2005]. Even so, if chorus wave power increases one would\nexpect precipitation >300 keV and >1 MeV to increase, but\nthis is not observed.\n[14] The other possibility is that there is some additional\nscattering at higher energies during the recovery phase that\ndoes not scatter 300 keV electrons very effectively. Fast\nmagnetosonic waves can contribute to pitch angle scattering\nat MeV energies but cannot diffuse electrons into the loss\ncone on their own [Horne et al., 2007]. Electromagnetic ion\ncyclotron (EMIC) waves can scatter electrons with energies\n>500 keV [Summers and Thorne, 2003; Albert, 2003]. They\nare observed near dusk and on the dayside [Meredith et al.,\n2003]. However, unless the plasma density is very high,\nsuch as inside the plasmapause or in high density plumes on\nthe dayside, EMIC waves generally scatter electrons greater\nthan a few MeV or more. The waves are excited by a\ntemperature anisotropy in the proton distribution that is\ninjected during the main phase and forms the ring current. If\nthese waves are responsible for the additional scattering at a\nfew MeV, the question is why is the precipitation not\nobserved during the main phase. Ground based observations\nin the Antarctic show that EMIC waves are mainly observed\nduring the recovery phase [Engebretson et al., 2008], but\nFigure 3. Electron precipitation >1 MeV. The small red\nregion over South America is contaminated by protons and\nis not considered.\nFigure 4. Same as Figure 3 but for >300 keV.\nL19104 HORNE ET AL.: ENERGETIC ELECTRON PRECIPITATION L19104\n3 of 4\nthese observations do not rule out their presence during the\nmain phase since the ionosphere may be so disturbed that\nthe waves cannot reach the ground.\n[15] We suggest that the reason why >1 MeV precipita-\ntion is higher during the recovery phase is a consequence of\nhow the radiation belt is reformed during storms. The new\nconcept recently put forward [Horne, 2007] is that convec-\ntion, substorms, and inward radial diffusion transport elec-\ntrons inward at energies up to a few hundred keV. These\nform unstable distributions that excite whistler mode chorus\nwaves which further accelerate electrons up to several MeV.\nHowever, it takes 1\u20132 days to accelerate the electrons up to\na few MeV. Thus EMIC waves would be more effective in\nprecipitating >1 MeV electrons during the recovery phase\nafter the electrons had had time to be accelerated. In effect\nthe chorus waves accelerate the electrons up to energies of a\nfew MeV whereupon EMIC waves precipitate them.\n[16] The data show that the largest change in chemistry\ndue to MeV electron precipitation should occur in the\nsouthern hemisphere poleward of the SAA region and should\noccur during the recovery phase of storms. Thus chemistry\nclimate models should take into account a 1\u20132 day delay in\nMeVelectron precipitation and higher MeV fluxes poleward\nof the South Atlantic when modelling the atmospheric\nresponse to geomagnetic storms and solar variability.\n[17] Acknowledgment.
