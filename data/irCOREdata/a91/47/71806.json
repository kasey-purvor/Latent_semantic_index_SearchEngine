POOLEY \u2217\nDepartment of Geography, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YB\nabstract: This article explores the ways in which a young woman who migrated\nfrom Londonderry to London in the 1930s acquired and used spatial knowledge\nof the city. Using detailed diary evidence the article maps everyday action spaces,\nand examines themes such as the use of visual cues in the accumulation of spatial\nknowledge, the use of maps and signs, the influence of previous travel experiences\nand the organization of search and exploration strategies in the city.\nWhen someone moves to a new town they necessarily acquire information\nabout the place. Today there are many different ways to gain this\nknowledge: they may talk to friends, read guidebooks and magazines,\ndownload material from the web or watch relevant programmes on TV.\nThe acquisition of such information both adds to the enjoyment of being in\na new place, and aids the process of settling in to a new home. Knowledge\nof anurban areamayhelp to choose a suitable homeor school, to determine\na journey towork, to establish a regular pattern of shopping and to develop\nlinkswith facilities and the local community. This process of gaining spatial\nknowledge, that aids assimilation to a new environment, is usually taken\nfor granted and is rarely examined in an historical context. However, it\nmay fundamentally affect the ways in which someone uses the city, their\ninteraction with neighbours and the environment and their overall quality\nof life. Limited knowledge may lead to isolation, restricted mobility and\nsocial exclusion.1\nThis article takes the theme of knowledge and the city and explores\nthe ways in which a young woman who migrated from Londonderry\n(Northern Ireland) to London (England) in the late 1930s acquired and\nused knowledge of a city that she was visiting and living in for the first\ntime. In doing so, the article explores two more specific questions: how\n\u2217 Thanks toMrsRhonaWard formaking the diaries available, allowing them to be copied and\nagreeing to be interviewed; to the ESRC for funding a research project on the longitudinal\nanalysis of residential histories during which the diaries were initially identified; and to\nDr Jean Turnbull who was Research Associate on the ESRC project.\n1 M. Rahman, G. Palmer and P. Kenway, Monitoring Poverty and Social Exclusion 2001 (York,\n2001); D. Byrne, Social Exclusion (London, 1999).\nThe construction of spatial knowledge in London 211\ndoes a newly arrivedmigrant gain spatial knowledge of a large urban area;\nand how does the acquisition of spatial knowledge of the city influence an\nindividual\u2019s everyday life and use of that urban space? Research for this\narticle has developed from a large-scale project on migration in Britain\nin which, amongst other evidence, we collected a number of personal\ndiaries and accounts of migration.2 One such diary provides evidence for\nthis article. Material on the process of migration and the construction of\nidentity has been published elsewhere,3 but the source has not been used\npreviously to explore the themes addressed in this article.\nContext\nThere is a long tradition of studies of spatial cognition in psychology,\ngeography and urban planning, but little that has systematically applied\nthese concepts in an historical context. Perhaps the seminal text from a\ngeographical perspective is Kevin Lynch\u2019s The Image of the City.4 In this\ninfluential work, Lynch focused on the interaction between environmental\ncues and spatial knowledge, arguing that the physical structure of the city \u2013\nthe way in which it is designed and ordered \u2013 influences our ability to find\nour way around an urban area. In his introduction Lynch summarizes the\nimportance of adequate spatial knowledge:\nTo become completely lost is perhaps a rather rare experience for most people in\nthe modern city. We are supported by the presence of others and by special way-\nfinding devices: maps, street numbers, route signs, bus placards. But let themishap\nof disorientation occur, and the sense of anxiety and even terror that accompanies\nit reveals to us how closely it is linked to our sense of balance and well-being.5\nTo some degree such work drew on the tradition of urban ecology, and\nthe associated concern with neighbourhood and community interaction,\nwhich was most clearly represented by the work of American sociologists\nin Chicago from the 1920s.6 But Lynch focused attention much more\nclearly on the interaction between the individual and urban design and\navoided the ecological assumptions of Park and his associates. The theme\nof cognitive mapping \u2013 the way in which we collect, store and use spatial\nimages \u2013 became rather fashionable in behavioural geography in the 1970s,\nfocusing especially on the concept of \u2018Mental Maps\u20197 and summarized\nmost fully in a volume by Downs and Stea that focuses on the ways in\n2 C.

Lefebvre identified three key elements of urban space: spatial\npractice, or theways inwhich space is organized and used; representations\nof space, conceived mainly by architects, planners and those in control\nof urban environments; and representational space, or the images and\nmeanings associated with space by those who use it.13 Bourdieu\u2019s concept\nof \u2019habitus\u2019 focuses on the construction ofmeaning in everyday lifeworlds.\nWhilst \u2019habitus\u2019 is related to objective criteria such as class, gender and\nethnicity, it is additionally concernedwith values, cognitive structures and\neveryday practices including such things as dress, language, comportment\nand consumption.14 However, these studies often lack empirical historical\nevidence to substantiate their theoretical arguments. Material presented in\nthis articlemayhelp to test some of the theoretical formulations. Suchwork\ncan also be related to research in cognitive and developmental psychology\nthat explores, muchmore scientifically thanmost research by geographers,\n8 R. Downs and D.

Recent research in this area has focused on\nissues such as gender, age and class variations in spatial knowledge, and\non the extent towhich spatial knowledge is linked to an individual\u2019s wider\ntravel experience.16 However, the relative importance of different factors\nthat may influence spatial cognition appears to remain uncertain.\nDrawing on this wide range of research it can be suggested that there are\na number of key factors that may be explored in relation to the acquisition\nof spatial knowledge by a migrant newly arrived in a city. These include\ninvestigation of the impact that specific environmental cues have on the\nacquisition of spatial knowledge; assessment of the specific finding aids\n(maps, signs) that an individual utilizes in acquiring spatial knowledge;\nexamination of theways inwhichprevious travel experiences influence the\ndevelopment of spatial knowledge in a new environment; analysis of the\norganization and structure of individual search and exploration strategies;\nand investigation of the extent to which the acquisition of knowledge\nof a city is a voluntary activity, or something forced on individuals by\nnecessity? In this article, these issues are explored in a specific historical\ncontext: that of a young woman exploring London for the first time in the\n1930s.\nThe source\nAnalysis presented in this article is based on one set of diaries principally\ncovering the period 1937 to 1942. They forman extraordinarily rich account\nof everyday life for a young woman who migrated from Londonderry\n(Northern Ireland) to London (England) and of her adjustment to life in the\nmetropolis prior to and during the Second World War. The validity of the\ninterpretation presented obviously depends on the reliability and content\nof the source, and there is a substantial literature on the interpretation of\nwriting about the self in both the present and the past. However, most\nstudies focus on the writings of a small and atypical elite group who\nwere both literate and leisured, and often had a particular reason for\nputting their thoughts inwriting.17 Historical geographers and others have\n15 M.

The best glimpses into the everyday lives of relatively ordinary\npeople come through rarely surviving diaries, autobiographies and life\nhistories written at the time, though these too can only reflect the lives of\na literate minority amongst the working class.20 As with accounts written\nby the rich and famous, we must also question why such accounts\nwere kept, what the intended audience was and whether the writer was\ntrying to convey a particular message.21 However, in comparison with\nautobiographies and other writing, the analysis of diaries has received\nvery little critical attention.22 The diary on which this article is based\nbegins to fill this gap.\nThe diarist (R)was born into a Protestant family in Londonderry in 1919,\nand in January 1938 she migrated alone from Londonderry to London to\ntake work as a typist with the Inland Revenue, having taken the Civil\nService typing exams in Northern Ireland. This article focuses especially\non R\u2019s first few months in London, exploring her spatial search strategies\nwhen she first arrived in the city.

They were clearly written up each evening,\nand record almost everything that she did during the day, includingwhere\nshe went, whom she was with, what food she ate (and how much it cost),\nwhat books she read, the films she saw and her thoughts, hopes and fears.\nIn particular they provide a vivid insight into the process of migration, her\nfeelings on leaving home and her adjustment to life and work in London.\nIt is probably not uncommon for a young woman to keep a personal\ndiary, but these records are unusual in their detail and consistency over a\nprolonged period, in the fact that they have survived some 60 years and\nhave beenmade available for historical analysis and in the degree towhich\nthey provide information on the process of migration and adjustment to\nlife in London. The diaries were clearly written as a personal document,\nwith no expectation that they would ever be read by anyone else and, as\nfar as can be ascertained, factual information in the diaries is accurate.\nIt is obviously important to remain critical of the source, but there is no\nevidence that the writer had any other motive than that of recording her\neveryday activities in a mostly matter-of-fact way. Additional information\nhas been added from an extended interview with the diarist conducted in\nher own home in 1996, and this oral evidence has been used to probe\nsome diary evidence in more detail. However, the oral responses are\ninevitably affected by R\u2019s later life in London, and by the influence of\ntime on memory.23 In this article, most emphasis is given to the diary\nentries which record R\u2019s feelings about life in London when the diary was\nwritten (albeit filtered through her perceptions at that point in time), rather\nthan her later reflections. There is not space to explore differences between\nthe oral and written evidence in this article. All references to individuals\nhave been anonymized in the following analysis, but everything else is\nreported as recorded in the diary or interview.\nAction space in London in the 1930s\nBefore exploring search strategies and the acquisition of spatial knowledge\nin detail, it is useful to contextualize R\u2019s life in London. This can be done by\nexploring the action spaces through which R moved during her early life\nin the city, but first there is need to provide some brief background to the\ncity. Although in the first half of the twentieth century London experienced\na net loss of population, as those who were able to moved to expanding\nsuburbs and satellite towns,24 there continued to be a substantial inflow\nof migrants to London from most parts of the British Isles. Thus in 1931\n23 K. Fields, \u2018What one cannot remember mistakenly\u2019, Oral History, 17 (1989), 44\u201353;\nA. Thomson, M. Frisch and P.

In addition, London had by far the largest labour\nmarket area of any British city, drawing its daily workforce from an ever-\nexpanding zone around the home counties.25 Employment opportunities\nwere the main motivation for most people migrating to London in the late\n1930s. Although the worst of the depression years were over, economic\nrestructuring of the inter-war years meant that a much wider range of\nwork was available in London\u2019s offices and factories than in most other\nparts of the country.26\nThere was a long tradition of migration from Ireland to London. In the\nnineteenth century London contained the largest Irish-born community\nin Britain,27 and opportunities for employment meant that the capital was\nalso aprominentdestination for second-wave Irishmigration following the\npartition of Ireland in 1922.28 Young Irishwomenwere especially attracted\nto work in London in the 1930s, where employment as nurses, in shops,\noffices and in newautomated factorieswaswidespread. Although the bulk\nof female migration from Ireland to Britain, and especially London, was\nof Catholic girls (often from the Irish Republic), there was also a steady\nstream of Protestant migrants from Northern Ireland.29 Thus in 1931 there\nwere 39,229 Irish-born women living in the County of London, forming\n1.7 per cent of the total female population. Of these 12.4 per cent had\nmigrated from Northern Ireland, though their religious affiliation is not\nknown.30 Such migrants were often following well-established migration\npaths, with existing Irish support networks for new migrants in London.\nHowever, despite these networks movement away from home and Ireland\n25 J.

Such movement must also be set against the complex political\nrelationship that existedbetweenBritain, theRepublic of IrelandandUlster\nafter partition.31\nThe inter-war years saw a significant expansion of female employment\nin the office sector. Although many supervisors\u2019 jobs continued to be male,\nfemale secretaries and shorthand typists gradually replaced the army of\nmale clerks that had dominated the office sector in the nineteenth century.\nHowever, some women who had been employed during the First World\nWar lost their jobs to men returning from the forces.32 Within the hierarchy\nof office employment the Civil Service was perceived as an attractive\noption. The various branches of the Civil Service employed large numbers\nof office workers in London and elsewhere (around 387,000 non-industrial\nworkers in 1939 of whom one quarter were female), and offered a secure\ncareer structure with short hours, good working conditions and reason-\nable rates of pay. The disadvantages of office employment in the Civil\nService included the fact that there was a competitive entry examination\nand the expectation that further qualifications would be gained, a very\nhierarchical structure with most employment in large anonymous typing\npools, restrictions on the employment of married women and lower rates\nof pay than in some private companies.33 The experience of R, migrating\nfrom Northern Ireland to London to take employment as a typist in a Civil\nService office, was thus typical of many girls who moved to the metropolis\nfrom Ireland and other parts of the British Isles in the 1930s.\nWhen she first arrived in London in January 1938 R lodged in an (all\nfemale) hostel in Earl\u2019s Court (West London), but in February 1939 moved\nto lodge with a family in Canonbury (North London). Initially she worked\nin the Inland Revenue office at Turnstile House, High Holborn, but in June\n1939 was transferred to the Euston Office in Upper Woburn Place. Her\nhome and workplace largely structured the action space through which\nshe moved (Figs. 1, 2). The life world of R in London was relatively wide\nranging, but also followed a routine that meant that most of her journeys\n31 D. Pringle, One Island, Two Nations?

She walked frequently, used public\ntransport for longer distance travel in the city, rarely felt scared or alie-\nnated \u2013 though commented on the peculiarities of new locations \u2013 and did\nnotmind travelling aroundLondon alone, althoughmany of her tripswere\nin the company of friends. The majority of R\u2019s daily activities were centred\naround her home, workplace, central London tourist attractions, cinemas\nand theatres. Not surprisingly, the location of some of these activities\nchanged when she moved lodgings in February 1939. Thus after moving\nfrom Earl\u2019s Court to Canonbury, she transferred her evening classes in\nshorthand typing to a college at Highbury much closer to her new home.\nShe also attended a different church and her regular walks were taken in\ndifferent parks. However, other activity patterns overlapped and many\nof the places she visited whilst living in West London continued to be\npart of her action space when she moved further away. This partly reflects\nan increasing range of activities and locations because she had been in\nLondon longer, but also indicates the importance of certain contacts and\nactivities. Thus she regularly visited a friend in Ealing, and with her went\nto places such as Kew Gardens and Richmond Park. The ways in which\nThe construction of spatial knowledge in London 219\nFigure 2: Places in London visited by R whilst living in Canonbury,\nFebruary 1939 \u2013 December 1940\nR acquired and used spatial knowledge can be illustrated through three\nexamples of her movement around the city during her first few months in\nLondon.\nArriving in London\nWhen she caught the ferry from Belfast to Heysham on 28 January 1938 it\nwas the first time that R had left Ireland. However, she did not travel alone.\n220 Urban History\nShe was accompanied by her father, and by a friend (who was also going\nto work in London) together with her friend\u2019s father. R\u2019s father stayed\nin London over the weekend that she arrived, and they used the time to\nvisit family friends and contacts in and around London, thus apparently\ngiving R some points of contact in her new environment. However, R\u2019s\nfather did not know London either, and in her recollections of the move\nto London R suggests that they had no firm plans and that they were \u2019a\npair of innocents abroad\u2019.34 R\u2019s diary account of her arrival in London,\nand first journey to Earl\u2019s Court, suggests that she was a keen observer of\nthe environment through which she passed, comparing London to more\nfamiliar places, and identifying landmarks that would become part of her\nspatial knowledge of the city:\nWe arrived at London at 12.15. It is very bleak looking (the station) and after the\nstyle of Belfast station, only bigger. Then we went in a bus to near Earl\u2019s Court.\nWhen we got off we had a good bit of walking, and my arm ached with holding\nmy things. The road to Earl\u2019s Court was very interesting. Full of people, buses, cars\nand great big shops.35\nWhenRwas settled in thehostel, andher father hadbooked into anearby\nguesthouse, R and her father decided to visit a family friend in Ealing\n(N. London). R\u2019s diary account shows that they had difficulty finding the\naddress, and this is backed up by her oral recollections of this first journey\nacross London.\nThen Daddy booked his room and we went to N. Ealing. Here we could not find\nMayfield Avenue and then found that we had mistaken an W for an N. We walked\na bit until we got a bus which took us to near Mayfield Avenue. Mrs S\u2019s house is\nvery nice.36\nWe had no plans in a kind of way, no routine to follow. Like we had this tea, in the\ncafe\u00b4, then we decided we would go and see a friend of my father\u2019s Mr S. who lived\nout at Ealing. I remember we got out the address to see what the address was and\nI don\u2019t know how we . . . I think maybe in the letter it said maybe which station\nwas nearest to where they lived, and I don\u2019t think we had a map of London, we\nwere . . .we didn\u2019t know what we were doing did we? I don\u2019t think that my father\nrealised how big the place was, and I didn\u2019t have the faintest notion.37\nBoth the diary account, and later recollections, suggest that R (and her\nfather) were relatively unprepared for finding their way around London.\nThey did not use a map, had no clear plans and relied on a relatively well-\nsigned public transport system to take them to the places they wished to\nvisit. On the Sunday R and her father took the train to Tonbidge in Kent\nto visit a relative, and on the way back took the opportunity to introduce\n34 Interview, 1996.\n35 Diary, 29 Jan. 1938.\n36 Ibid.\n37 Interview 1996.\nThe construction of spatial knowledge in London 221\nR to some key landmarks in central London: \u2019Soon after tea we went to\nthe station and came back to London. We walked down the Strand to\nsee Somerset House. I also saw some Fleet Street and Trafalgar Square\nwith Nelson\u2019s Monuments. Then we had milk and came home.\u201938 It can\nbe suggested that this was a deliberate strategy to improve R\u2019s spatial\nknowledge of the part of London in which she would be working, and in\nparticular to locate Somerset House where R was to report for work on\nMonday morning, though the office to which she was eventually allocated\nwas in High Holborn. It can be suggested that through these mundane\nspatial practices she began to embed herself in the city, and to acquire\nsufficient knowledge and cultural capital to enable her to carry out her\neveryday life.\nEstablishing a routine in the city\nFor her first journey to work on the underground train (about 45 minutes\ndoor to door) R was accompanied by a girl she had met at the hostel, and\nwho also worked for the Inland Revenue. She thus relied on someone with\nmore knowledge of London to get her to work on time: \u2019I met D. and we\nwent and got our tickets 3\/-. We walked through a little green place and\nup to Somerset House. D. took me to the new wing.\u201939 During her first\nday at work R\u2019s diary records that she found the typing difficult, \u2018I did\nmore work fearfully slowly and all wrong\u2019, and that at lunchtime she had\ndifficulty deciding what to do and where to go. She still found the city\ndisorienting and had not yet acquired sufficient spatial knowledge to use\nit effectively.\nAt lunchtime I found that there was no canteen. Some of them got lunch boxes but\nthere was not any left when I went. I didn\u2019t know what to do at first and then I\nwent out to a Milk Bar and got soup and hot milk. I then walked about a bit and\nthen went back to the office.40\nAfter work she met her father at Charing Cross station and, after tea and a\nroll in Lyon\u2019s Corner House, she caught the tube back to Earl\u2019s Court and\nher father began his journey back to Londonderry. It is significant that they\nmet at Charing Cross which is the station that R used to get home, rather\nthan Euston which is where her father would have gone to get the train\nback to Heysham. This suggests that R was not yet sufficiently confident\nto find her own way from Euston back to Earl\u2019s Court.\nHowever, the following day R\u2019s diary records that she was moving\naround the city with considerably more confidence. She travelled to work\nalone, making a detailed note of the route, and at lunchtime she had a\n38 Diary, 30 Jan. 1938.\n39 Diary, 31 Jan. 1938.\n40 Ibid.\n222 Urban History\nclearer idea of where to go and seemed to begin a deliberate strategy of\nexploring new places in the vicinity of the office. Overall, after only a day\non her own in London, she expressed much more confidence:\nAfter that [breakfast] I went to the station. From there to Charing Cross. I walked\nthrough a little park, through Somerset House, across the road, through Bush\nHouse, up Aldwych to Kingsway and so to Holborn. Turnstile House is a modern\nbuilding. I think I can do the things better now. At lunchtime I went to the Milk\nBar where I had steak and kidney pie and chips 4d. Then I went for a walk and\nfound myself in Lincoln Inns Fields where the solicitors are. I walked round them\nand saw some men who fed the pigeons and sparrows.41\nThe following day she followed exactly the same routine, but the day\nafter gradually became more adventurous visiting the British Museum\nin her lunch break and after work met a girl from the hostel and visited\nBig Ben, the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey. During her\nfirst two weeks in London R\u2019s routine varied little. She almost always\ntook the same route to work, mostly went to the same Milk Bar for\nlunch, and then walked round Lincolns Inn Fields and adjacent streets,\nor visited the British Museum. Some evenings she attended secretarial\nclasses at Bush House after work. She quickly established a restricted\naction space around her work environment, in which she felt comfortable\nand which seemed to meet her needs, but she rarely strayed from familiar\nterritory (partly restricted by the length of her lunch break). Similarly, she\nquickly established a regular routine of activity around her hostel in Earl\u2019s\nCourt. She shopped locally (mostly in Woolworths), with other girls from\nthe hostel went to church (St Columba\u2019s Church of Scotland), Crusaders\n(a girls\u2019 religious organization) in Holland Park and the cinema in Old\nBrompton Road. She quickly settled into an ordered existence, moved\nthrough familiar territory, often went out with other girls from the hostel,\nand rarely expressed any feelings of homesickness, fear or unease. She\nhad acquired enough spatial knowledge to feel comfortable and to use the\ncity on a day-to-day basis, and through her everyday mobility and social\npractices had begun to create her own \u2018habitus\u2019 within the city.\nExploring the city\nOver the next threemonths R\u2019s action space in London gradually extended\nand she began to make a more deliberate attempt to explore parts of the\ncity that she had not encountered before. In particular, Saturday afternoons\nand Sundays were increasingly spent on expeditions that took her both\nto the main tourist sights of central London and further afield. Some of\nthese trips were in the company of other girls from the hostel, some were\nundertaken tovisit friends elsewhere inLondonor to showvisitors around,\n41 Diary, 1 Feb. 1938.\nThe construction of spatial knowledge in London 223\nbut others were carried out alone. After a few weeks in the city R appeared\nto have no fear of travelling quite widely, an interpretation backed up by\nher recollections: \u2018I was quite safe. It never crossed my mind that I wasn\u2019t\nsafe.\u201942\nHer first expeditions were mostly with friends from the hostel to view\ntourist attractions. Thus three weeks after she had arrived in London R\nvisited Buckingham Palace (of which she gave a detailed description) and\nthen followed a tourist route in which she clearly noted and commented\non key landmarks, and was presumably acquiring spatial knowledge for\nfuture use:\nWe went down Constitution Hill (which is not a hill) to Hyde Park Corner. We\nwent down and looked at the \u2018Duke of Kents\u2019 home 3 Belgravia Square. It is not an\nextra nice house. There was a policeman outside it. After this D and I went down\nPiccadilly to Piccadilly Circus. On the way I saw fine shops and hotels. I saw Eros\nin the middle of the Circus. I saw the Mall, the Wellington Memorial and the Duke\nof York\u2019s Monument. We passed through Trafalger Square on our way to Charing\nCross station.43\nOn the weekend of 5\/6March she further extended her action space. On\nSaturday shemade her first solo visit to the friend in Ealing that she andher\nfather had called on the firstweekend theywere in London, and on Sunday\nshe visitedKewGardenswith a friend from the hostel. Other places visited\nfor the first time on outings over the next few weeks included the Victoria\nand Albert Museum, Regents Park, St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, Tottenham Court\nRoad and Oxford Street, Battersea Park and the City of London. In April,\nR\u2019s mother visited from Londonderry and together they toured some of\nthe central tourist sights, and also travelled to Kensington and Hampton\nCourt. Most such journeys were undertaken by tube (though she also used\ntrams or buses and walked quite long distances), details were carefully\nrecorded in the diary, suggesting that Rwas building up a personal mental\nmapof the city, and shewas clearly increasingly confident inhermovement\naround London. Thus in May she went off on her own to explore a part of\nLondon that she had not visited before:\nI then decided to do some exploring. I bought a 1\/-tram ticket and went off to\nHampstead Heath. I arrived at South End Road Gate. There was a Punch and Judy\nshow . . . I had a good walk about the Heath. It is very nice but there are far too\nmany people about it. The weather was somewhat cool. I ended out by coming\nout at the tram terminus at Highgate. I took a trip from there right past the East\nIndia Dock. The route there is most interesting and you do see some queer looking\npeople. There is one place I noticed which was very Jewish. It was all not at all like\nwhat I thought the East End was. It is very nice indeed in parts . . .The roadways\nare all railed in in the East-end and there are only openings for crossings.44\n42 Interview, 1996.\n43 Diary, 19 Feb. 1938.\n44 Diary, 8 May 1938.\n224 Urban History\nThis confidence in moving around the city, and R\u2019s deliberate desire to\nexplore and acquire spatial knowledge of the city over her first fewmonths\nin London, is borne out by her later recollections. These also suggest that\nthe clear signing of the underground, and the certainty of moving on a\nfixed-route transport system, was a real attraction in the first few months\nwhen Rwas uncertain of how tomove from one part of London to another.\nDuring the first year I tended to go on the underground because I, by going on\nthe underground I used to get out at every station in turn and look round and go\nback, so that in the end I connected up all the places together. Of course London\nwas so big. And after a year or so, then I started to go on the buses. Because then\nI was able to have a map in my head of what London was. I was able to find my\nway around.45\nNot surprisingly she, and her friends, did make mistakes, but they were\nrarely seen as problematic and were recorded as minor misfortunes to be\nlaughed at. However, they do show that even on the well-signed tube it\nwas possible tomake errors that could temporarily disrupt a journey. Thus\nsoon after she arrived in London she recorded: \u2019When at Charing Cross\nI took a train which flew past Earl\u2019s Court, and away to Hammersmith.\nWas I astonished! I got a Piccadilly train back, however I was home later\nthan I expected.\u201946 And a little later she and her friends again got muddled\non the tube in territory with which they should have been fairly familiar.\nR recorded the incident in her usual detail.\nWe decided to take a 1d ride from Holborn to Charing Cross. We went down two\nescalators, down it seemed into the depths of the earth. We went to platform 4. We\ngot on a train. We had to change at Leicester Square. We got off alright and went\nup a couple of escalators. At the top we went to the Baker line. We went down a\nlong escalator. We got on the wrong train. It took us to Warren Road, the opposite\ndirection to Charing Cross.We got off atWarren Road, we tried to get off at Goodge\nStreet but the doors shut before we could get out. We got safely in a train that took\nus straight to Charing Cross. We got to P just in time for tea at 5.47\nOverall, evidence from the first four months of R\u2019s life in London shows\na young woman who, though mostly moving through familiar routes,\nwas also acquiring spatial knowledge that extended over much of the city.\nThere is also evidence, both from the diary and later recollections, that\nshe deliberately attempted to explore unfamiliar parts of the city and that\nas she built up a clearer mental map of London she moved around with\nincreasing confidence. This sense of being at ease in the city is borne out by\nboth diary entries and later oral testimony. By September 1938 she clearly\nviewed herself as a Londoner; she had acquired cultural identity with\nthe city, and did not consider returning to the relative safety of Northern\n45 Interview, 1996.\n46 Diary, 7 Feb. 1938.\n47 Diary, 27 Feb. 1938.\nThe construction of spatial knowledge in London 225\nIreland in the run up to the Second World War. In this she suggests that\nshe was unusual as many of her friends did leave London and return to\ntheir parental homes.\nNearly all the Irish and Scotch girls say that if there is a war they are going home.\nDid you ever hear of such a cowardly lot! There are, however, a few people like\nmyself who would stay here.48\nI wonder why all the girls here are simply dying to get home for good? I see only\na very few advantages and a whole lot of disadvantages. The chief is, I think, that\nI would not be able to do exactly as I like.49\nOh after a year or so. When the war came I never though of going home. I don\u2019t\nremember anyone at home saying why aren\u2019t you coming home . . . I would have\nsaid I was beginning to become a native, yes, I liked London.50\nConclusions\nEvidence from one diary, backed up by some later oral testimony,\nsuggests that R developed quite deliberate strategies for acquiring spatial\nknowledge of London, and very quickly assimilated sufficient information\nto allow her to operate effectively in the city. Diary evidence also\nsheds some light on the factors that influenced the acquisition of spatial\nknowledge. R took a keen interest in her surroundings and recorded in\nsome detail the places she visited and key landmarks. On her journey to\nwork, to evening classes and for other purposes she travelled along regular\nroutes which, it can be suggested, she negotiated using the buildings\nand landmarks she recorded in her diary as spatial cues. Thus, following\nLynch,51 the imageability of London with its distinctive landmarks helped\nher to navigate the city and enabled her to feel secure when travelling\naround London.\nIf landmarks and buildingswere important to R,mapswere not. There is\nno evidence either from the diary or the oral testimony that she ever owned\nor used a map to navigate around London when she first arrived. A good\n\u2018Geographia\u2019 atlas and guide to London was readily available (relatively\ncheaply at 2s 6d in the 1940s) but she did not seem to own one. Rather,\nR at first relied mainly on the well-signed underground that ran on a\nwell-mapped fixed route, later making more use of buses that seemed\nto require more spatial knowledge to use effectively. Typically, R would\nidentify a station near where shewished to go, use the tube to travel to that\nstation and then (if necessary) ask directions locally to get to her precise\ndestination. The impression is that she found London an easy city to move\n48 Diary, 14 Sep. 1938.\n49 Diary, 15 Sep. 1938.\n50 Interview, 1996.\n51 Lynch, The Image.\n226 Urban History\naround, using publicly available signs and key landmarks, and without\nrecourse to maps.\nR was not well travelled before she moved to London. Apart from\nlocal travel within Northern Ireland (mainly to Belfast and on family\nholidays) shehad rarely been far fromhomeandhad certainlynot travelled\nindependently. However, this did not seem to curtail hermovementwithin\nLondon. Within a few days she acquired sufficient spatial knowledge to\nmove through those parts of the city that she needed to use, and quite\nrapidly extended this knowledge to new areas. There is no evidence that\nlack of previous travel experience inhibited the process of getting to know\nthe city.\nR\u2019s diary gives the impression that her individual search and exploration\nstrategies were quite deliberate and well organized. After (understand-\nably) feeling somewhatuneasyonherfirst dayalone inLondon she seemed\nto develop specific plans that enabled her to get to know the areas in\nwhich she lived, worked, shopped and undertook leisure activities. After\na few weeks, weekends were increasingly used deliberately to explore\nnew areas of the city. To some extent the ease with which she developed\nsearch strategies, despite no previous travel experience, may be related\nto the fact that she lived with a group of girls in similar circumstances\nand that many of her early journeys were undertaken in a group. The\nshared experience of getting to know the city was important and, in\nher early days in London, there were girls to show her around and\nfamiliarize her with the transport system. However, very quickly, R was\nperfectly happy to explore the city alone and in her determination to\nstay in London in the run up to war she showed considerable indepen-\ndence.\nThe acquisitionof spatial knowledgebyRduringherfirst year inLondon\nwas almost entirely voluntary.Her journey toworkwas clearly determined\nby her employment, but beyond that all her activities were taken to please\nher. She had few constraints on her life and she seemed very content. Even\nafter the outbreak of war in 1939, her activity pattern changed little. She\nwas forced by bomb damage to move house once (to an adjacent street);\nsome local movements were restricted by air raids, and she increasingly\nspent more time at weekends staying with a friend outside London to\nescape the bombing. But for the most part daily activities went on much\nas before, the main change being that in her role as air raid shelter marshal\nshe mixed rather more with the local community in Canonbury than she\nhad done previously.\nIn conclusion, it might be asked if any of this is important? The evidence\nof one diary provides an interesting case study, but can more general\nconclusions to be drawn? It is suggested that a focus on individual action\nspaces is important for at least four related reasons.\nFirst, most studies of the social geography of cities continue to focus\non the development of residential areas, and the pattern and process of\nThe construction of spatial knowledge in London 227\nresidential segregation.52 A focus on action space emphasizes the fact that\nin order to understand segregation there is need to focus not only onwhere\npeople lived, but also on where they worked, shopped, undertook leisure\nactivities or just passed through in their daily lives.53 It can be suggested\nthat R\u2019s knowledge of the city was rather greater than might be inferred\nfrom information on where she lived and worked. The social patterns and\nprocesses associated with action spaces rather than residential spaces are\nrarely studied in the past.\nSecond, the study of individual action spaces, and the processes by\nwhich spatial knowledge is acquired, focuses attention on the ways that\nresidents used the city. It can be suggested that, all too often, the\nrelationship between people and the city is portrayed as relatively\npassive.54 The account in R\u2019s diary suggests that she actively used the\ncity as a resource to meet her (often limited) needs. She also developed\nspecific search strategies to gain information, and used this information to\nstructure the activities in her life. There is no reason to suggest that R was\nin any way unusual in this respect. It can be suggested that more attention\nshould be focused on the role of the spatially active citizen and the ways\nin which urban space was used in everyday life.\nThird, attention is often focused on the role of individual communities\nin cities, assuming that knowledge of and identity with the local area\nis particularly important in structuring everyday activities and social\nrelations.55 Although some of R\u2019s activity patterns were locally based,\nin reality she (probably like most people) operated in several different\ncommunities: the girls with whom she lived; the girls with whom she\nworked, specific friends that she visited from time to time; church and\nother social activities. Some of these overlapped, but often they formed\nseparate communities used for different purposes at particular times. A\nfocus on individual knowledge of the city, and the ways in which that\nknowledge was used through everyday action spaces, reminds us of the\ncomplexity of community relations.\nFourth, much contemporary cultural research on urban space and\nmobility places great emphasis on the cultural significance of place, on\nissues of identity and alienation and on the role of movement through and\nuse of the city in constructing the self.56 Whilst R\u2019s diary provides some\n52 P.

Re-creation of R\u2019s first few\nmonths in London from her diary creates a picture of a 19-year-old girl\nadopting a very pragmatic approach to establishing herself in a new urban\nenvironment. Most of her journeys were undertaken either for routine and\nmaterial reasons (work, study, shopping), or were deliberately constructed\nto explore the city. R moved easily through a substantial part of London,\nand she quickly established her identity as a Londoner. However, there\nis little evidence that she strongly identified with particular places or\ncommunities. It can be suggested that for R the construction of self and\nplace identity occurred at a very general level: identification with the\ntotality of a large, complex and exciting city, rather than with particular\naspects of the urban environment.\nIn historical research it is relatively rare to gain access to sources that\nprovide sufficient detail to reconstruct the minutiae of everyday life. Even\noral evidence is suspect as many mundane events may be distorted. A\ndetailed diary is the only way in which such material is likely to survive.\nIt is thus proposed that this case study, which certainly cannot claim any\ntypicality, does suggest somemore general points. As outlined above these\nemphasize the complexity and individuality of spatial search strategies\nand the acquisition of spatial knowledge about a city. However, it also\nneeds to be emphasized that whilst knowledge of a city is essential to\nallow residents to use its resources effectively, for some the size, complexity\nand relative anonymity of the city is also an advantage. This was clearly\nstated by R who not only got to know London well, but also on reflection\nvalued the protective anonymity that it provided, particularly in relation\nto what she saw as the more claustrophobic small-town community of\nLondonderry:\nWhat I like about London and all this is the fact that you are anonymous. Nobody\nknows you. At first I thought it was a disadvantage didn\u2019t I, people not knowing\nyou. After a while I\u2019ve discovered it was a marvellous thing. The fact that nobody\nknew you and that you were free. You were free to do whatever you liked. Get\nwhatever you liked. Go wherever you liked. That is marvellous, isn\u2019t it! 57\nHer knowledge that London was anonymous, and the lack of identity\n(and identification) that it conveyed, was another important part of the\ninformation she gained during her early years in the capital.\n57 Interview, 1996.\n"}
