In: (Eds) Campbell C, Deacon H. \nUnderstanding and Challenging Stigma. Special edition of Journal of \nCommunity and Applied Social Psychology. 16: 411-417. \n  \n \nAbstract \n \n \nThis special edition on \u2018Understanding and Challenging Stigma\u2019 seeks to \nfurther our understandings of the types of representations and practices \nthrough which stigma is perpetuated, the social contexts within which they are \nproduced and reproduced, and the possibilities for agency, resistance and \nintervention. In this introductory piece, we outline three broad approaches to \nstigma in the existing literature \u2013 individual, macro-social and multi-level. \nAligning ourselves with the latter, we discuss how social effects become \nsedimented in the individual psyche in ways that often make it difficult for \nstigmatised group members to resist their devalued social status. This insight \nframes our discussion of the papers in this volume \u2013 which cover various \ntypes of stigma, drawing on research in six countries. We focus on the ways \nin which the papers contribute to our understandings of (i) the material, \npolitical, institutional and symbolic contexts of stigma; (ii) the possibility of \nresistance to stigma; and (iii) the types of interventions most likely to facilitate \nsuch resistance. We conclude that the fields of social and community \npsychology have a central role to play in advancing the types of \nunderstandings that are so urgently needed to inform effective multi-level \nstigma-reduction interventions. \n \n \n The editors of this special edition are keenly aware of the limited effectiveness \nof strategies to reduce particular forms of illness stigma. This highlights the \nneed for more communication between stigma researchers across various \ncontexts to improve stigma theory, research methods and the planning and \nassessment of anti-stigma interventions. We have therefore brought together \npapers that explore stigma across various categorisations \u2013 disease \n(diabetes, tuberculosis, AIDS), race\/ethnicity, immigration status, occupation \n(sex work), sexuality (gay men) and health-related behaviours (smoking), \ndrawing on qualitative research in Ghana, India, Zambia, Tanzania, South \nAfrica and England. The papers deal with various dimensions of stigma: \ncauses, modes of expression, consequences and responses. Each seeks to \nunderstand the complexity of the social psychological contexts within which \nstigma arises, and how it might be challenged or resisted. \n \nGoffman (1963) characterises stigma as a \u201cmark\u201d of social disgrace, arising \nwithin social relations and disqualifying those who bear it from full social \nacceptance. Marks take various forms: \u201cabominations of the body\u201d such as \nphysical deformities, alleged \u201cblemishes of individual character\u201d such as \nmental illness or unemployment or \u201ctribal identities\u201d, such as religion or \nethnicity. People who possess such characteristics acquire a \u201cspoiled identity\u201d \nassociated with various forms of social devaluation. \n \nSome argue that it is important to distinguish between stigma (understood as \nnegative ideologies or attitudes) and discrimination (negative behaviours) \n(e.g. Deacon, this volume). Others define stigma as a blend of affective, \ncognitive and behavioural responses, with the primacy of each factor resulting \nfrom variable interactions between the nature of the stigma, the context in \nwhich it is encountered, and individual differences amongst interactants (e.g. \nHeatherton et al., 2005). \n \nThe stigma literature is diverse, with three broad trends: the first two \nrepresenting a polarisation between individual and macro-social levels of \nanalysis, and the third seeking to build bridges between these (Deacon et al., \n2005). \n \nIndividualistic explanations for stigma \u2013 often drawing on social cognition \napproaches \u2013 examine psychological attributes of perpetuators or targets, or \ninter-individual interactions between them (e.g. Herek et al. 2002), paying \nlimited attention to social power, inequality and exclusion. They tend to focus \non the stigmatiser more often than the stigmatised, and are often associated \nwith interventions that implicitly align stigma with ignorance, seeking to reduce \nstigma by providing people with \u2018the facts\u2019 about an illness or about \nstigmatised groups. \n \nWhen attention is given to the stigmatised, this falls within individual-level \nmodels of stress and coping (e.g. Levin and van Laar, 2006). Existing social \nrelations are usually taken as given. The burden of adjustment falls on \nstigmatised individuals \u2013 with their responses conceptualised in terms of their \nindividual abilities to adapt to the stress of stigma. Individual counselling is \noften the associated intervention for stigmatised people. \n \nThe failure of individual-level approaches to effect widespread stigma \nreduction has led to an alternative focus on the links between stigma and \nwider macro-social inequalities (e.g. gender, ethnicity). Such analyses \nsuggest that stigma is not something that individuals impose on others, but a \ncomplex social process linked to competition for power, tied into existing \nmechanisms of dominance and exclusion (Parker and Aggleton, 2003). \nMacro-social analyses imply that interventions such as anti-discrimination \nlegislation or poverty-reduction will assist in stigma reduction. But taking this \nview can mean that researchers pay little attention to the individual \npsychological dimensions of stigma. \n \nIt is possible to straddle individual and macro-social analyses. Link and \nPhelan (2001) define stigma as the co-occurrence of: labelling, stereotyping, \ncategorical in-group\/out-group separation, status loss and discrimination, \nemphasising the exercise of power as an essential element. Rooting their \nexplanations in psychoanalytic theory rather than social cognition, Crawford \n(1994) and Joffe (1999) highlight the processes through which the individual \nand social are inextricably intertwined in the construction of stigma.  They \nargue for a universal human fear of uncertainty and danger. Individuals \nproject this onto identifiable out-groups \u2013 responding negatively towards them \nto distance themselves from the threat. Whilst such \u2018othering\u2019 is common \nacross societies, the targets of stigma often vary, with choice of the \u2018other\u2019 \nreflecting wider power differentials in particular settings.  \n \nCombining macro-social and psychological analyses facilitates a better \nunderstanding of individual compliance, change and resistance to \nstigmatisation. For example, Crawford\u2019s  (1994) study of AIDS stigma in the \nUnited States analyses how the stigmatisation of people with HIV\/AIDS \n(compounded by the association of HIV\/AIDS with marginalized out-groups \nsuch as intravenous drug users, gay men, sex workers and ethnic minorities) \nreinforces a conservative \u2018middle American\u2019 social morality \u2013 which requires \npeople to police their behaviour in ways that support the economic and \npolitical status quo. \n \nFaced with multiple layers of social disadvantage, it may be difficult for people \nto challenge their stigmatised status. This is particularly problematic because \n\u2018power is seldom conceded without a demand\u2019 (Bulhan cited in Seedat, 2001). \nSocial elites seldom voluntarily give up their power without a vigorous demand \nfrom excluded groups. Given the social and intra-psychic benefits of \n\u2018othering\u2019, the \u2018non-stigmatised\u2019 may have a complex and multi-layered \ninvestment in maintaining the symbolic status quo.  \n \nThis \u2018self-policing\u2019 is deeply social psychological, rooted in the complex \nmechanisms through which the social becomes sedimented in the individual \npsyche. Even when members of stigmatised groups are not exposed to overt \nand direct acts of discrimination,  individuals who carry stigmatised markers \nmay \u2018internalise\u2019 negative representations of their status (Goffman, 1963). \nThis may lead to loss of confidence and self-esteem, undermining the \nlikelihood that they will challenge their devalued status.  \n What are the implications for anti-stigma activists?  Here we would argue \nagainst a simplistic view of power which regards stigmatised people as \npassive victims of inexorable social forces, ignoring that where there is power, \nthere may also be the potential for individual\/ collective resistance. In certain \nconditions stigmatised people may contest, even transform, stigmatising \nrepresentations and practices. Much remains to be learned about the types of \nrepresentations and practices through which stigma is perpetuated, the social \ncontexts within which they are produced and reproduced, and the possibility \nof agency and resistance. It is here that we locate this volume\u2019s contribution. \n \nUnravelling the contexts of stigma \n \nEach paper contributes to particular specialist literatures \u2013 perspectives too \nrich and varied to summarise here. In this section we seek only to highlight \nhow papers contribute to understandings of the material, political, symbolic \nand institutional contexts that support the stigmatisation of various groups; \nundermining or enabling opportunities for group members\u2019 agency and the \ndevelopment of positive, active self-definitions that might inform \nindividual\/collective resistance to stigmatisation. \n \nMaterial contexts \n \nAt the material level,  poverty\/deprivation are potent drivers of the \nstigmatisation of diabetics in Ghana (de-Graft Aikins), of people with \ntuberculosis (TB) in Zambia (Bond and Nyblade) and African migrants with \nAIDS in England (Dodds). The combined effects of poverty and gender \ndiscrimination make Indian sex workers particularly vulnerable to \nstigmatisation (Cornish). Poverty also serves undermines resistance to \nstigma. The psychologically disempowering effects of deprivation mean that \nworking class British smokers are far less able to withstand the stigmatisation \nof smokers than their middle class counterparts (Farrimond and Joffe). The \nsocial psychology of deprivation also significantly reduces the likelihood of \nstigmatised group members taking full advantage of health campaigns (e.g. \nanti-smoking campaigns) or potentially life-saving HIV\/AIDS treatment in \nSouth Africa (Mills). \n \nPolitical contexts \n \nConceptualising \u2018political\u2019 in terms of the operation of power in social relations, \neach paper provides insights into political contexts of stigma. The term \n\u2018layered stigma\u2019 highlights that stigma may follow existing social faultlines, \ndeepening existing divisions between e.g. men and women, rich and poor. \nDeacon warns against simplistic associations between stigma and existing \npower differentials, however, saying that stigma may sometimes affect \nmembers of high status groups, or create new social faultlines. As such, it is \nnot always a replication of existing power relations, but also sometimes a new \nsource of power inequalities.  \n \nDodds shows how AIDS stigma \u2018overlaps\u2019 with other sources of social \nmarginalisation in the UK, including homophobia, xenophobia and racism. \nLayers of stigma preserve social structures in the on-going constitution and \nreconstitution of \u2018insider\u2019 and \u2018outsider\u2019 groups. Dodds\u2019s findings highlight the \ncomplexity of overlaps and their effects \u2013 showing how the positioning of \npeople with AIDS in other social hierarchies shapes the extent and type of \nstigma that they faced. E.g. whilst the experiences of gay white men with \nAIDS are extremely negative, the experiences of black African migrants with \nAIDS are even worse in the face of additional layers of marginalisation \nresulting from lack of access to British nationality, citizenship and cultural \nintegration. \n \nInstitutional contexts \n \nSeveral papers show how institutional contexts facilitate stigmatising \nrepresentations and practices. The public health system plays a key role in \nperpetuating the TB stigma in Zambia through its overly zealous isolation of \nTB sufferers (Bond and Nyblade). Posters depicting smoking as a disgusting \nhabit may unintentionally reduce the likelihood of working class smokers \nquitting. They may play into the complex processes that undermine the \nconfidence and self-esteem of deprived groups in England, and their sense of \ncontrol over their health \u2013 with well-intentioned campaigns more likely to \nperpetuate than remove health inequalities (Farrimond and Joffe). \n \nHowever just as institutions create stigmatising contexts, they also open up \nspaces for resistance and social change. The success of the Indian \nSonagachi Project shows the role a well-networked NGO can play in \nchallenging stigma in conditions of poverty and exclusion (Cornish). The \nchurch plays a key role in stigmatising people with HIV\/AIDS in Tanzania, yet \nit also opens up spaces within which people are starting to problematise this \nstigmatisation  (Hartwig et al.). These insights echo Foucault\u2019s warning \nagainst simplistic and unidimensional accounts of power and oppression, \nkeeping us alert to ever-present possibilities for resistance even in \nunexpected places (Foucault, 1980).  \n \nSymbolic contexts \n \nUsing the term \u2018symbolic\u2019 to refer to the frameworks of understanding within \nwhich people make sense of their life experiences, each paper throws light on \nthe symbolic contexts within which stigma is constructed, internalised or \nresisted. Mills\u2019 discussion of non-verbal gestures used to communicate about \npeoples\u2019 HIV\/AIDS status in South Africa reveals the rich seam of metaphors \nthrough which stigma is expressed \u2013 reminding us not to limit explorations of \nthe symbolic to the verbal realm alone. \n \nDe-Graft Aikins maps out the representational field in which people make \nsense of diabetes in Ghana \u2013 including wider representations of unhealthy \nlifestyles and the supernatural. She highlights the interpenetration of the \nsymbolic and the material, showing how poverty shapes how people give \nmeaning to illness. The symbolic-material link is also emphasised in Cornish\u2019s \naccount of how representations of \u2018rights\u2019 are mobilised by activists to redefine \nthe occupation of sex work in a less stigmatising way, whilst emphasising that \ncalls to \u2018rights\u2019 are most likely to lead to effective collective action when \naccompanied by the possibility of real material changes to peoples\u2019 lives. \n  \nDisease stigmas may be multiplied when layered with other stigmatised \nconditions. Bond and Nyblade highlight how TB stigma is exacerbated \nthrough its link with AIDS in Zambia. Whilst the symbolic link between TB and \nAIDS reflects the biomedical reality of co-infection, the biomedical co-\nexistence of diabetes and AIDS is less common. However, diabetes is often \nincorrectly linked to AIDS through the shared symptom of weight loss. This \nleads to equally distressing and debilitating consequences for people with \nuncontrolled diabetes in Ghana, as de-Graft Aikins demonstrates in her \ncontextualisation of diabetes experience within interlocking cycles of \nbiophysical disruption, financial destitution and psycho-social neglect. \n \nAgency and resistance \n \nHowarth argues that in certain conditions stigmatised people may contest and \neven transform stigmatising representations and practices \u2013 and that a social \npsychology of stigma needs to take account of human capacity for agency, \nand to allow for the possibility of resistance and change. She emphasises that \nsocial knowledge is \u201calways in the making \u2026.. constantly reworked, resisted \nand transformed as we find new ways of mastering our constantly changing \nrealities\u201d. Stigmatising representations are not always internalised. Negative \nrepresentations may jar with an individual\u2019s or group\u2019s experience of \nthemselves, leading to resistance and the renegotiation of previously \nstigmatising representations in a more positive light.  \n \nFurthermore, stigma will not always be a disadvantage. Stigmatised identities \nmight even become a platform for group mobilisation and resistance. In \nexceptional circumstances, people might even gain status if they \u2018come out\u2019 \nwith a stigmatised characteristic e.g. in the South African Treatment Action \nCampaign, with its assertive \u2018HIV positive\u2019 message (Deacon) \n \nIn some cases, agency and resistance may arise spontaneously. However \nwhere stigma overlaps with other forms of social devaluation, external support \nor intervention may be necessary to facilitate resistance by devalued groups. \nFor example, an \u2018external change agent\u2019 of some sort may work with \nmembers of stigmatised communities to develop the skills, support networks \nand resources that enable them to (i) think critically about their negative social \nrepresentation; (ii) develop a sense of confidence and capacity to challenge it; \n(iii) collectively negotiate locally appropriate and realistic individual and \ncollective anti-stigma strategies; and (iv) identify and build the types of \nstrategic alliances most likely to facilitate effective action (Campbell, Nair and \nMaimane, in press).  \n \nFrom analysis to action \n \nElsewhere, we have lamented the mismatch between the copious research \ninto \u2018what stigma is\u2019, and minimal research on \u2018what to do about it\u2019 (Deacon et \nal., 2005). Several papers in this volume seek to address this problem, \ncommenting on implications of their findings for stigma-reduction \ninterventions. \n \nDe-Graft Aikins supports her argument for multi-faceted interventions through \nher account of the interplay of factors (biophysical, economic, symbolic, social \npsychological and structural) that drive diabetes stigma. In addition to health \neducation and improved service delivery, she highlights the potential for self-\nhelp groups to help provide psycho-social support for diabetics. However, the \nmost fundamental driver of stigma in her context is material: poverty and \nunder-resourced health services. She highlights two recent \u2018landmark\u2019 \ndevelopments in Ghana \u2013 a National Insurance Scheme providing medical \ncover for chronic illnesses, and a Disability Bill providing the disabled with free \naccess to medical care (following a rights-based approach). \n \nFocusing narrowly on small-scale church-based interventions, Hartwig et al. \nemphasise the value of workshops in providing space for reflection in a \ncomplex and contradictory environment, and for the construction of narratives \nabout ways in which individual religious leaders have creates opportunities to \nchallenge stigma. \n \nCornish provides a detailed social psychological account of the processes \nthrough which the Sonagachi Project has successfully challenged the \nstigmatisation of sex work. She shows how the social psychological realm is \ndeeply penetrated by the material and symbolic in ways that open up the \npossibilities of resistance and change, with skilful facilitation, and under \nexceptional circumstances. The project challenged the fatalism undermining \nwomen\u2019s agency in conditions of poverty and many-layered social devaluation \nthrough a double pronged approach. Efforts to facilitate alternative and \npositive self-understandings went hand in hand with the possibility of real \nmaterial changes in peoples\u2019 daily lives, such that the material and symbolic \nwere intertwined as  \u201ccomplementary aspects of a single process of politicised \nchange\u201d. \n \nStigma is a quintessentially social psychological topic: a phenomenon rooted \nin the individual psyche, yet constantly mediated by the material, political, \ninstitutional and symbolic contexts referred to above. Community psychology \nalso has a key role to play in advancing our understandings of the possibilities \nfor collective resistance and for stigma-reducing psycho-social change. Much \nremains to be learned about the mechanisms through which individuals and \ncommunities may resist stigma, and the contexts which facilitate or hinder this \nprocess \u2013 we hope this volume contributes to this challenge.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThanks to Flora Cornish and Ama de-Graft Aikins for comments. \n \nReferences \n \n1.
