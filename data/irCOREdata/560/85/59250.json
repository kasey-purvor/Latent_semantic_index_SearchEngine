Introduction \n \nIn 2006 the Environment Agency of England and Wales and the Department for Environment Food \nand Rural Affairs established a National Demonstration Programme in the United Kingdom to \nevaluate the effectiveness of a range of water treatment options for the removal of endocrine \ndisrupting chemicals (EDCs) from waste water effluent (Huo and Hickey, 2007). The demonstration \nprogramme involved the collaborative participation of ten water companies in England and Wales \nand was coordinated by UK Water Industry Research (UKWIR, 2009). As part of this programme, a \ngranular activated carbon (GAC) system for the adsorption of EDCs was installed at Swindon waste \nwater treatment works (WWTW; Rodbourne, Swindon, UK). The primary purpose of the upgrade \nwas to eliminate from the effluent, or significantly reduce in concentration, steroid estrogens and \nother potential endocrine disrupters. The study described here was part of a project designed to \nevaluate some of the effects of the GAC upgrade on the fish populations downstream of the \nWWTW.  \n \nThe three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) was selected as the target species for the \nstudy because of its local abundance, ease of capture, and status as a model species for ecological,  \nbehavioural and ecotoxicological studies (Katsiadaki et al., 2002; Pottinger et al., 2002; Sanchez et \nal., 2008a; Huntingford and Ruiz-Gomez, 2009). The stickleback populations in the R. Ray and in a \nnearby reference river unaffected by WWTW discharges, the R. Ock, were sampled at intervals \nduring the study period. No evidence for disruption of the endocrine reproductive system or of \ngonadal structure, was detected in the stickleback population in the R. Ray prior to remediation \n(Katsiadaki et al., unpublished). However, because the GAC adsorption process is effective in \n4 \n \nremoving a high proportion of organic molecules from solution (Kim et al., 2007; Snyder et al., \n2007) the possibility that the remediation of the effluent affected targets other than the reproductive \nendocrine system was investigated. Indices of somatic status (weight, length, RNA:DNA ratio) \nwere assessed for fish in both rivers, making the assumption that these high-level endpoints would \ncollectively integrate the effects of any change in conditions in the R. Ray arising from effluent \nremediation and the R. Ock would in addition control for any influences on the fish populations of \ncatchment-wide events. The activity of the monooxygenase cytochrome P4501A, as both \nethoxyresorufin\u2013O-deethylase (EROD) activity and as the relative abundance of cytochrome P450 \n1A (CYP1A) transcription, was measured in order to determine whether exposure of the fish to one \nsubset of organic contaminants (polyaromatic hydrocarbons) typical of urban WWTW effluent was \nreduced following installation of the GAC plant.  \n \n2. Materials and methods \n \n2.1. Sampling sites  \n \nFish were sampled from four sites on each river (Fig. 1, Table 1). On the R. Ray the first of these \nwas immediately adjacent to the WWTW outfall (mean dry weather WWTW discharge = 0.51 \nm3\/sec, data courtesy Thames Water; mean annual river discharge 1.34 m3\/sec, Water Eaton \nGauging Station; Marsh and Hannaford, 2008) with additional sites 1.8 km, 5.9 km and 9.5 km \ndownstream. Three reference sites were located on the R. Ock and one on the Childrey Brook, a \nmajor tributary of the R. Ock. These sites received very little waste water (maximum dry weather \nWWTW flow upstream of the sampling sites = 0.009 m3\/sec, data courtesy Thames Water; mean \nannual river discharge 1.55 m3\/sec, Abingdon Gauging Station; Marsh and Hannaford, 2008). \nSamples of fish were collected from both rivers on six occasions prior to the remediation of the \neffluent (April, May, July, September and November 2007 and January 2008) and on five occasions \n5 \n \nfollowing the commissioning of the GAC plant at the Rodbourne WWTW (in March, May, July, \nSeptember and November 2008).  \n \n2.2. Water chemistry \n \nWater temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, ammonium-N, conductivity and turbidity were \nrecorded at 20 minute intervals using sondes (YSI 6920; Yellow Springs Instruments) sited 100m \ndownstream of the Rodbourne WWTW effluent discharge point on the R. Ray (ROD), and at \nCharney Bassett (CB) on the R. Ock.  \n \n2.3. Fish capture and processing \n \nThree-spined sticklebacks were captured with a large hand net (38 cm D-frame, 0.5 cm mesh, 1.5 m \nglassfibre handle). After capture, fish were held temporarily in buckets containing river water and \nthen killed with a lethal dose of anaesthetic (2-phenoxyethanol, 1:1000). Fish were placed in \nindividually labelled 12 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes and frozen in a liquid N2 dry shipper \n(Taylor-Wharton CryoExpress CX500, Jencons plc) for transfer to the laboratory. On arrival the \nsamples were transferred to a freezer (-80\u00b0C) for storage until required for analysis. Tubes \ncontaining fish were removed from the freezer in groups of six and placed on ice. While still frozen, \neach fish in turn was removed from its tube and weight (mg) and fork-length (mm) were recorded. \nA ventral incision was made using dissecting scissors and the heart and kidney were removed and \nstored frozen for subsequent VTG and spiggin analysis (Katsiadaki et al., unpublished). For a sub-\nset of fish in January and March 2008 livers were processed as described in 2.5. For an additional \nsub-set of fish in September and November 2007 and 2008 the liver was removed and placed into \n1.0 ml RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich) in a 1.5 ml capped polypropylene centrifuge tube on ice. The \nremainder of each fish was returned to the sample tube and placed in the freezer. Liver samples in \n6 \n \nRNAlater were held at 4\u00b0C for 24h and then stored (-20\u00b0C) until required for RNA extraction. After \ndissections were completed, the remainder of the fish was homogenised to provide a substrate for \nthe measurement of total RNA and DNA. Each fish was minced on a glass Petri dish with a single-\nedged razor blade. The minced tissue was returned to the sample tube and chilled homogenisation \nbuffer was added (4:1; volume:weight; Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 0.1M NaCl, 0.01 M \nEDTA). The mixture was homogenised using an IKA Ultra-Turrax TP18\/10 with an 8 mm \ndispersing tool (S25 N\u20138 G), with cooling on ice between bursts. The homogenate was stored \nfrozen (-20oC) until required for assay. \n \n2.4. RNA:DNA ratio \n \nNucleic acids were extracted from homogenised stickleback tissue using 1% sarcosyl (N-\nlauroylsarcosine sodium salt) in buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) and quantified \nusing a fluorescent dye-binding method (Quant-It RiboGreen reagent, RNA assay kit; Invitrogen) as \ndescribed by Gorokhova and Kyle (2002). RiboGreen is a non-specific nucleic acid dye allowing \nestimation of total RNA + DNA fluorescence (excitation 485 nm, emission 535 nm; Fluoroskan \nAscent FL; Thermo Scientific) and then, following RNAse treatment of the sample, quantification \nof fluorescence attributable to DNA alone and by difference between the two readings the RNA \ncontent. \n \n2.5. EROD \n \nActivity of the cytochrome P4501A monooxygenase, ethoxyresorufin\u2013O-deethylase (EROD) was \nmeasured in liver tissue from fish collected in 2008 from the two rivers immediately prior to \n(January) and following (March) commissioning of the GAC plant. A microplate kinetic assay \nrequiring small amounts of tissue was adopted, based on that described by Hodson et al. (1996). \n7 \n \nLivers were homogenized in a constant volume of 400 \u03bcl phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, containing 20% \nglycerol; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM dithiothreitol) in a 1.5 ml capped centrifuge tube, using a motor-\ndriven pestle, then centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The assay was carried out in 96-well plates in \na plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent FL, Thermo Scientific) with excitation at 530 nm and emission at \n590 nm. For the unknowns, each well of the plate contained 50 \u03bcl liver homogenate supernatant and \n50 \u03bcl of 10.0 \u03bcM 7-ethoxyresorufin in homogenisation buffer. Protein concentrations in the liver \nhomogenates were determined using the fluorescamine-based microplate method of Lorenzen and \nKennedy (1993).  \n \n2.6. CYP1A gene expression \n \nRNA was extracted from stickleback livers (RNeasy mini kit, Qiagen) and converted to cDNA \nusing a high capacity cDNA reverse transcriptase kit (Applied Biosystems). The yield and purity of \nRNA extracts was assessed at 260 nm using the Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Labtech). \nRelative expression of CYP1A was determined using a StepOne real-time PCR machine (Applied \nBiosystems). The sequences for amplification primers and a minor groove binding (MGB) Taqman \nfluorogenic probe were derived from previous work (Geoghegan et al., 2008). Primers CYP1AFP \n(5\u2019-GGAATTGTCAATGACCTGTTTGG\u20133\u2019) and CYP1ARP (5\u2019-\nCGGATGAGCCACCATGTACA-3\u2019) and the MGB Taqman probe CYP1ATP (5\u2019-6FAM-\nACACCGTCAGCACGACATTGTCATGG-3\u2019) were checked for specificity by using BLASTn \n(Altschul et al., 1997) within the NCBI suite of facilities (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). All reagents and \nkits used in amplifications were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Optimum primer (300 nM) and \nMGB probe concentration (250 nM) were determined empirically using cDNA pooled from fish \nliver RNA extractions as template. Duplex relative gene expression real-time PCR assays were \nperformed in 20 \u00b5l reaction volumes. All reactions received the following: 3 \u00b5l cDNA; 10 \u00b5l \nTaqman Gene Expression Master Mix (2x concentration); 2 \u00b5l of each primer (300 nM); 2 \u00b5l (250 \n8 \n \nnM) MGB and 1 \u00b5l Human 18S rRNA endogenous control mixture (containing limited \nconcentration primers and VIC-labelled MGB Taqman probe specific to 18S rRNA). The cycling \nparameters of 1 cycle of 50\u00b0C for 2 min (activation of uracyl glycosylase) followed by 1 cycle of \n95\u00b0C for 10 min (activation of Amplitaq gold) and 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C  for 15 secs and 60\u00b0C for 1 \nmin were maintained in all cases. In accordance with accepted guidelines for carrying out the \ncomparative cycle threshold (Ct) method, the relative amplification efficiencies of template and \nendogenous control were tested and confirmed. Baselines and cycle threshold values were \nautomatically calculated by the StepOne software. Expression of CYP1A in each sample was \nnormalised to that of 18s rRNA using the equation R = 1000*[(2Ct18s) \/ (2CtCYP1A)] where R is \nrelative expression level, and Ct is the cycle threshold for target and control genes. Amplification \nefficiencies were not adjusted for each sample. The overall mean Ct value of 9.0 obtained for the \ninternal control gene (18s rRNA) was similar to the value previously reported for 18s in zebra fish \nliver (11.7; Filby and Tyler, 2007) and recent studies indicate that the expression of 18s remains \nconstant in sticklebacks during exposure to chemical stressors (Williams et al., 2009). The overall \nmean Ct value for CYP1A was approximately 22.5.  \n \n2.7. Statistical analysis \n \nBody mass, fork length, RNA:DNA ratios, EROD and CYP1A expression data were transformed \n(log10(data + 1)) where necessary and differences between means were evaluated with analysis of \nvariance (ANOVA; Genstat for Windows V. 8, Lawes Agricultural Trust; Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, \nSigmaStat 3.5, Systat Software Inc.). Multiple comparison post tests to assess significant \ndifferences between times or rivers were carried out using the estimated standard error of the \ndifferences between means (Genstat) or with pairwise multiple comparisons using Dunn\u2019s method \n(SigmaStat). Water chemistry data were analysed with a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s \npairwise multiple comparison test (SigmaStat). For all analyses alpha was set at 0.05. The \n9 \n \nKolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test (SYSTAT 11; Systat Software Inc.) was used to determine \nwhether the length frequency distributions differed significantly between the two rivers. Specific \ngrowth rate (SGR) for fish in the R. Ray was calculated as percent day-1 for either mass or length: \nSGR = [100*(ln(Wt2\/Wt1)\/(t2-t1)] where Wt2 and Wt1 were the mean body mass or length for fish in \nNovember and July respectively and (t2-t1) was the number of days within this period. A paired t-\ntest (SigmaStat) was used to compare SGR during the pre- and post-remediation periods. \n \n3. Results \n \n3.1. Water chemistry and physicochemical measurements \n \nSeasonal variation in water temperature for both rivers was evident from data collected at the \ncontinuous monitoring sites (R. Ray: Rodbourne; R. Ock: Charney Bassett; Fig 2a; Table 2) and \nfrom that collected at time of sampling (Table 3). The two rivers exhibited a markedly different \ntemperature regime during the two-year monitoring period with the mean temperature in the R. Ray \ndownstream of the Rodbourne WWTW in both years significantly higher than that in the R. Ock \n(P<0.001). There was a negligible decline in water temperature at sites downstream of the WWTW \n(Table 3) and a temperature difference between the two rivers of at least 2 \u2013 3oC was sustained at all \nsites and in both years (Table 3). Mean DO concentration (as percent saturation) was higher in the \nR. Ock than in the R. Ray (P<0.01; Fig. 2b, Table 2) during 2007. Following the installation of the \nGAC plant in February 2008, DO concentrations in the R. Ray were significantly elevated \ncompared to pre-remediation levels (P<0.01) but remained lower overall than those in the R. Ock \n(P<0.01). The pH was significantly lower in the R. Ray than in the R. Ock (P<0.001) and no \nchanges in pH were evident in the R. Ray following the installation of the GAC plant (Table 2). \nAmmonium\u2013N concentrations were significantly higher in the R. Ray  than in the R. Ock in both \n2007 and 2008 and higher in 2008 than 2007 in both rivers (Table 2). Higher conductivity and \n10 \n \nturbidity levels in the R. Ray indicated that the R. Ray contained higher concentrations of \nsuspended and total dissolved solids than the R. Ock (Table 2).  \n \n3.2. Body mass, fork length, sex ratio \n \nThe data from Childrey Brook (Venn Mill; VM) were combined with those from sites on the R. Ock \nand the aggregate data are referred to as R. Ock throughout. Fish abundance data were unavailable \nbecause of practical constraints. Mark-recapture methods for abundance estimation were not \nadopted because of the unrestricted movement enjoyed by the resident fish and quantitative \nestimation of abundance by catch depletion and timed electric fishing was also unsuccessful \nbecause of the preferred habitat of the fish. The size selectivity of the mesh in the dip nets dictated \nthat no fish smaller than 15 mm in length were caught. The distribution of three-spined sticklebacks \nat each sample site (comprising approx. 200m of river) was patchy with fish captured in areas \ncharacterised by low flow and the presence of submerged and emergent macrophytes. The \nstickleback populations in both rivers were annual, with few adult (1+) fish surviving beyond the \nspawning period into a second year, although the loss of adults post-spawning was most \npronounced in the R. Ray. The shape and location of the length frequency distributions for the \npopulations in the two rivers differed significantly (P<0.001). Fish in the R. Ock were smaller \noverall (mean \u00b1 SEM: mass, 663 \u00b1 13 mg; length, 38.3 \u00b1 0.2 mm; n = 782) than those in the R. Ray \n(mass, 841 \u00b1 20 mg; length, 41.9 \u00b1 0.3 mm; n = 663). No significant overall difference in body \nmass was evident between male and female fish during 2007 and 2008 (M: 749 \u00b1 18 mg, n = 570; \nF: 742 \u00b1 16 mg, n = 875; P > 0.05) although there was a small but significant difference in length \n(M: 40.3 \u00b1 0.3 mm; F = 39.7 \u00b1 0.3 mm; P<0.05). For clarity, data for both sexes were combined in \norder to compare the pre-remediation (2007) and post-remediation (2008) periods. During 2007 the \nsex ratio deviated from unity among both the fish caught from the R. Ray (M\/F = 0.69) and those \ncaught from the R. Ock (M\/F = 0.63; P<0.001; Chi square test). However, during 2008, the sex \n11 \n \nratio in the R. Ray did not deviate significantly from unity (M\/F = 0.79) whereas the R. Ock \npopulation remained biased in favour of females (M\/F = 0.53). Direct observation of fish in \nspawning condition coupled with the results of the histological examination of gonadal tissue \ncarried out during 2007 (C. Mungo, unpublished.) confirmed that fish in the R. Ray spawned earlier \nthan those in the R. Ock (April\/May and May onwards respectively).   \n \nLength frequency plots for the bi-monthly matched samples collected from the R. Ray in May, July, \nSeptember and November of 2007 and 2008 (Fig. 3a-d) show that during May 2007 (Fig. 3a) both \nadults (1+ years old) and juveniles (0+ years old) were present whereas the distribution was  \nunimodal from July onwards (Fig. 4a,b). Clearly separated year classes were not present in the \nlength frequency distributions for the R. Ock (Fig. 3e-h), with an overlap in size from July onwards \nbetween the juvenile fish and surviving adults evident in the extended upper tail of the distributions. \nFor fish in the R. Ray, mean body mass (Fig. 4a) and mean fork length (Fig. 4b) increased \nsignificantly (P<0.001) from July 2007 to a maximum in May 2008, a period during which the \nmajority of fish captured could confidently be assumed to be of the 07\/08 year class. During this \nperiod mean body mass for fish in the R. Ray increased more than 200% and fork length increased \nby 40%. For fish in the R. Ock, the increase in mean body mass (Fig. 4a) and fork length (Fig. 4b) \nduring the same period was significant (P<0.001) but proportionally less than that observed for fish \nin the R. Ray with mass increasing by 84% and length by 20%. The increase in both mean length \nand mass among fish in the R. Ock was interrupted by a significant (P<0.001) decline in both \nparameters between January and May 2008. A direct comparison of the matched pre- and post-\nremediation periods show that the pattern of growth for fish in the R. Ray was similar during both \nperiods (Fig. 4a,b). The mean mass and length of the first post-remediation generation of fish in the \nR. Ray sampled in July and November 2008 were not significantly different from those of fish \nsampled at the corresponding times in 2007. For fish in the R. Ock a different pattern was evident. \nWhereas during 2007 a clear and significant increase in both mean mass (P<0.05; Fig. 4a) and \n12 \n \nlength (P<0.001; Fig. 4b) occurred between July and November, during 2008 mean mass and length \nof fish in the R. Ock both declined significantly during this period (P<0.05). When mass and length \nof fish at different sites in the R. Ray during the period July-November was examined (data not \nshown) no significant consistent difference was evident between pre- and post-remediation periods, \nwith the exception of fish at the site immediately adjacent to the WWTW discharge which were \nsignificantly smaller in the post-remediation period (P<0.01). However, both length and mass \nshowed a significant downward trend with distance downstream from the WWTW. Fish captured at \nthe site farthest downstream on the R. Ray (7B) were significantly (P<0.001) smaller than those \ncaptured closer to the WWTW discharge (ROD, EB). No significant between-site differences were \nevident for either mass or length for fish in the R. Ock during the pre-remediation period (2007). \nHowever, during the post-remediation period in 2008 fish captured at Venn Mill (VM) and \nMarcham Mill (MM) were significantly larger than those at the other two sites (P<0.001). For fish \nin both the R.  Ray and R. Ock  mass varied significantly across monitoring periods when length \nwas included as covariate indicating variation in condition (ANCOVA, P<0.001). Overall, \ncoefficients of condition were higher in both rivers in 2008 (R. Ray 1.06 \u00b1 0.007; R. Ock 1.113 \u00b1 \n0.007) than 2007 (R. Ray 1.001 \u00b1 0.01; R. Ock 1.04 \u00b1 0.01).  \n \n3.3 RNA:DNA ratios and specific growth rates \n \nThere was a significant overall difference in mean RNA:DNA ratios between male and female fish \nin both rivers (P<0.001; female: 1.862 \u00b1 0.02; male: 1.415 \u00b1 0.03) but both sexes exhibited the \nsame pattern of change with time and so the data have been combined for clarity (Fig. 5). The \nRNA:DNA ratio showed a seasonal periodicity for fish in both rivers with higher ratios coinciding \nwith higher water temperatures but the pattern of change within each year was different. In both \nrivers, the RNA:DNA ratio declined significantly between May and November 2007 (P<0.001; Fig \n6) across a broadly similar range (~2.0 - ~ 1.0). Between November 2007 and March 2008, there \n13 \n \nwas a significant increase in RNA:DNA ratio in fish from the R. Ray (P<0.001; Fig. 5a) whereas in \nfish from the R. Ock no significant change in RNA:DNA ratio occurred during this period (Fig. 5b). \nIn both rivers the RNA:DNA ratio showed significant increases between March and May 2008 with \nfish in the R. Ock increasing by 200%. Thereafter ratios in fish from the R. Ray remained at the \nlevels achieved during May whereas in fish from the R. Ock the ratio declined significantly by more \nthan half between May and November 2008 (P<0.001; Fig. 5b). In order to assess whether the \ndifference in the RNA:DNA ratios in fish in the R. Ray between the pre-and post-remediation \nperiods was reflected in performance of the fish, the specific growth rates (SGR) for fish in the R. \nRay were examined. SGRs were calculated for the period when the population was composed of \njuvenile fish only (July-November). In the R. Ock, the length frequency distributions (Fig. 3e-h) \nand declining mean mass and length for this period (Fig. 4a,b) strongly suggested that the previous \nyears adult fish survived longer than was the case in the R. Ray, resulting in a mixed year class \npopulation and rendering the calculation of SGR via population means inappropriate. To compare \nthe SGR of fish in the R. Ray between 2007 and 2008, values were calculated for fish at each of the \nsample sites on the R. Ray. At three sites the SGRs for both length (Fig. 6a) and mass (Fig. 6b) \nduring the period July-November in 2008 were greater than those in the corresponding period in \n2007 and collectively this difference was significant (P<0.05). The clear exception to this pattern \nwas Tadpole Bridge (TB) at which there was a marked decline in SGR for both length and mass of \nthe fish between 2007 and 2008. \n \n3.4 EROD \n \nIn the samples collected during January 2008 (pre-remediation; Fig. 7a) EROD activity was \nsignificantly greater in fish collected from sites in the R. Ray compared to those from sites on the R. \nOck. However, in March 2008 (post-remediation; Fig. 7b) there was no difference in EROD activity \nevident between fish from the two rivers. In March 2008 EROD activity within samples from the R. \n14 \n \nRay was similar to that observed in January (range 6 \u2013 13 pmol min-1 mg protein-1) whereas EROD \nactivity in fish from the Ock was increased in March compared to that in January (< 3 pmol min-1 \nmg protein-1) to levels statistically indistinguishable from those in the Ray (7 \u2013 13 pmol min-1 mg \nprotein-1). No significant differences between the sexes were evident during January 2008 (male: \n4.2 \u00b1 0.8, n = 52; female = 5.2 \u00b1 1.1, n = 61) but in March 2008 EROD activity in males  was \nslightly but significantly greater than that in females (male: 11.0 \u00b1 0.7, n = 41; female = 9.0 \u00b1 0.7, n \n= 59; P<0.05).  \n \n3.5 CYP1A gene expression levels \n \nIn 2007, there was no significant difference between rivers overall in relative expression levels of \nCYP1A (Fig. 8a) although significant differences between sites both within and between rivers \nwere evident. For fish from the R. Ray there was a significant increase in CYP1A expression \nbetween Rodbourne WWTW and Tadpole Bridge (P<0.05). On the R. Ock, CYP1A expression was \nlowest in fish from Charney Bassett and significantly higher in fish from Venn Mill and Marcham \nMill (P<0.05). There was a significant increase in expression of CYP1A in fish from the R. Ock \nbetween 2007 and 2008 (P<0.05), but not in fish from the R. Ray and in 2008 (Fig. 8b) CYP1A \nexpression was overall significantly greater in fish from the R. Ock than in fish from the R. Ray. \nFor fish from the R. Ray in 2008 a similar spatial trend to that observed in 2007 was evident with \nCYP1A expression levels significantly higher in fish from Tadpole Bridge compared to those \ncaptured at Rodbourne (P<0.05; Fig. 8b). No significant difference in CYP1A expression was \nevident between the sexes. \n \n4. Discussion \n \nThe Rodbourne WWTW, which serves a population of approximately 135,000 in the south west of \n15 \n \nEngland, is a modern activated sludge plant with biological nutrient removal. The effluent \ndischarged is consequently of a relatively high standard. However, the R. Ray, into which the \nWWTW discharges, is a small river with limited dilution capacity. Water temperatures upstream of \nthe effluent discharge point on the Ray were similar to those in the R. Ock (D. Grover, pers comm.) \nwhereas downstream of the discharge the water temperature in the R. Ray was consistently 2-3\u00b0C \nhigher than that in the R. Ock. The mean DO concentration in the R. Ray was lower than that in the \nR. Ock and dissolved nutrients and suspended and dissolved solids (indicated by higher NH3-N \nconcentrations, greater turbidity and higher conductance values) were higher in the R. Ray. The  \nphysicochemical conditions in the R. Ray attributable to the WWTW discharge rendered direct \ncomparisons of the fish population in the R. Ray with that in the R. Ock inappropriate. Therefore, in \norder to detect effects that might be linked with effluent remediation following installation of the \nGAC plant, four samples of fish collected during each of two matched periods (May, July, \nSeptember, November) before (2007) and after (2008) the upgrade were compared between years \nwithin rivers. It was assumed that variation in local environmental conditions that might affect the \nfish populations (e.g. extreme weather events) would affect both rivers similarly. \n  \nA modelling exercise and chemical analysis of the receiving water (Balaam et al., 2010) indicated \nthat prior to remediation the mean annual total estradiol-equivalent concentrations downstream of \nthe discharge were in excess of 1 ng l-1 which is the predicted no-effect concentration for endocrine \ndisruptive effects in fish (Young et al., 2004). However, no evidence of such effects was detected in \nmeasurements of vitellogenin or spiggin, or in gonadal structure, in sticklebacks sampled from sites \ndownstream of the WWTW discharge (Katsiadaki et al., unpublished; Mungo, unpublished). \nOperation of the GAC plant was found to significantly reduce or completely eliminate steroid \nestrogens (estrone, 17\u03b2-estradiol, 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol) and total estrogenic activity in the effluent \n(Balaam et al., 2010). Granular activated carbon treatment is reported to remove up to 99% of \ndissolved organic contaminants from waste water (Ternes et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2007; Snyder et \n16 \n \nal., 2007) and it can therefore be assumed that the decline in steroid estrogens was matched by a \ndecline in the total organic chemical load delivered by the pre-remediation effluent.  \n \n4.1. Population structure  \n \nInterpretation of the somatic data for sticklebacks in the R. Ray and R. Ock was constrained by \nhaving only a single year of matched pre- and post-remediation observations. The abundance and \nmean size of sticklebacks in a single population can vary markedly across years (Wootton and \nSmith, 2000) and the original study design allowed for a 2-year monitoring period both before and \nafter effluent remediation but the GAC plant was installed and commissioned ahead of schedule. \nTaken collectively, the somatic data  indicate that the pre-remediation Ray, despite receiving a \nsignificant volume of WWTW effluent, was not a hostile environment for the resident stickleback \npopulation. The stickleback populations in both the R. Ray and R. Ock were found to be annual, \nwith few adults surviving beyond the spawning period and into a second year, and with the sex ratio \nin both rivers  biased towards females. These observations are consistent with previous reports of \nthe age structure (Mann, 1971; Allen and Wootton, 1982; O\u2019Hara and Penczak, 1987; Wootton and \nSmith, 2000; Poizat et al., 2002; Wootton, 2007) and sex ratio (Kynard, 1978; Wootton, 1984; \nMori, 1993; Arnold et al., 2003) of three-spined stickleback populations. Disproportionate mortality \namong males due to the energetic demands and risks associated with male parental investment has \nbeen suggested to account for the female bias (Chellappa et al., 1989; Arnold et al., 2003). \nHowever, in the present data set, the bias in sex ratio was not associated specifically with the post-\nspawning period. The ratios for the July, September and November samples, during which the bulk \nof the population would have been 0+ fish with no prior reproductive experience, were similar to \nthose that were obtained from the sample period in its entirety. The observed sex ratio may have \narisen in part from sustained differences in the relative \u201ccatchability\u201d of male and female fish due \neither to differences in net evasion or to different patterns of dispersion. No histological evidence of \n17 \n \ngonadal abnormalities, in particular intersexuality, was detected among fish from the R. Ray \n(Mungo, unpublished) but the possibility that the sex ratio of fish in both rivers was influenced by \nexogenous factors cannot be excluded.  The phenotypic sex of fish can be modified by exogenous \nsteroids and other contaminants (Devlin and Nagahama, 2002) and the EROD and CYP1A data \nsuggest that the R. Ock, contrary to expectations, was not a chemically pristine environment. Fish in \nthe R. Ock were subject to intermittent exposure to inducers of this enzyme system, and therefore \npossibly other classes of chemicals as well, although the source, identity and concentration of \ncontaminants is unknown. It therefore remains a possibility that the imbalance in sex ratio that was  \nevident among fish from both rivers arose from exposure to chemicals during a critical \ndevelopmental window of sensitivity (Hahlbeck et al., 2004). In this respect it is interesting that the \nsex ratio among fish in the R. Ock remained significantly biased in favour of females in 2008 \nwhereas following remediation in the R. Ray, the ratio was not significantly different from unity.   \n \n4.2. Body mass, fork length and specific growth rate \n \nSticklebacks in the R. Ray were larger overall than those from the R. Ock. Inter-population \ndifferences in the growth of sticklebacks may be in part attributable to heritable traits (Wright et al., \n2004) but in this case effects of the WWTW effluent on physicochemical characteristics of the R. \nRay are likely to have been the primary cause of overall differences in size of the fish in the two \nrivers. Both abiotic (temperature, oxygen availability) and biotic (food abundance, predation) \nfactors are likely drivers of variation in individuals size between stickleback populations  (Poulin \nand Fitzgerald, 1989; Wootton and Smith, 2000) with water temperature and food availability the \ntwo most important factors determining growth rate in fish (see Graham and Harrod, 2009, for \nreferences). Higher temperatures in themselves promote metabolic activity in poikilotherms and the \nwarmer water coupled with the nutrient content of the effluent (exemplified by higher ammonium-\nN concentrations in the R. Ray) is likely to have resulted in a more abundant food supply in the R. \n18 \n \nRay (Friberg et al., 2009), typical of rivers downstream of modern WWTW discharges (e.g. G\u00fccker \net al., 2006). There was a consistent trend for fish to decline in size with increasing distance \ndownstream from the WWTW but the water temperature changed little downstream of the WWTW \ndischarge, suggesting that a direct effect of temperature on the fish themselves was not the primary \ndriver for the size difference between the fish from the R. Ray and R. Ock..  \n \nIn the R. Ray, fish exhibited a pattern of growth similar to that reported for stickleback populations \nin Mediterranean streams (Clavero et al., 2009) with growth continuing through the winter months \nThis resulted in fish with mean lengths in May in excess of those reported for one-year old \nsticklebacks in other UK populations  (Mann, 1971; Allen and Wootton, 1982; O\u2019Hara and \nPenczak, 1987) and with clear separation between the current (0+, 2008) and previous (1+, 2007) \nyear classes. In July very few fish that could be apportioned to the preceding year class were caught \nin the R. Ray. The disappearance of post-spawning adult sticklebacks in early summer has been \nreported by others (Mann, 1971; Clavero et al., 2009) and it is only possible to speculate that the \nlarger adults evident in the May sample from the R. Ray in both years either evaded capture in \nsubsequent months, or succumbed to disease or size-selective predation. There was no statistically \nsignificant difference in the mean body mass and fork length of juvenile (0+) sticklebacks in the R. \nRay during July-November 2008 (post-remediation) and 2007 (pre-remediation). However, \ndifferences in growth rate were evident between these periods, with specific growth rates of fish at \nthree out of four sites on the R. Ray significantly greater following remediation than during the pre-\nremediation period. Interestingly, growth rate did not increase but actually declined between 2007 \nand 2008 at Tadpole Bridge, the site at which the highest CYP1A expression levels for fish in the R. \nRay were recorded.  \n \nIn the R. Ock, the annual growth profile for sticklebacks resembled that reported for other \npopulations in the UK (Allen and Wootton, 1982) with little growth evident between November and \n19 \n \nMarch, contrasting with the continued growth of fish in the R. Ray during this period.   \nClear allocation of the fish in the R. Ock to either the 0+ or 1+ year classes was not possible, with \noverlap in the length frequency distributions evident during both years. The length frequency \ndistributions for fish in the R. Ock suggested that 1+ adults were present throughout the summer \nmonths as is the case in some other UK stickleback populations (Allen and Wootton, 1982; O\u2019Hara \nand Penczak, 1987). The presence of two overlapped year classes, with recruitment of 0+ fish and \nloss of 1+ individuals through the summer of 2008, presumably accounted for the apparent decline \nin both mean mass and length of the R. Ock population during this period, a trend that was not \nevident in 2007 during which mean length and mass increased consistently during the summer \nmonths. Inspection of the length frequency distributions for 2008 suggests that 1+ fish may have \nbeen present in the R. Ock as late as November. This contrasting profile suggests that some aspect \nof the population dynamics of fish in the R. Ock (recruitment, adult survival) differed between \nyears. It is tempting to speculate that the different growth profile for fish in the R. Ock during 2008 \ncompared to 2007 was related to the higher levels of chemical exposure during 2008 evidenced by \nthe EROD and CYP1A data for fish in this river. \n \n4.3. RNA:DNA ratio \n \nThe difference in size of the fish between rivers was consistent with the time-course of changes in \nthe RNA:DNA ratio data. Whole-body and white muscle RNA:DNA ratios have been widely used \nto assess the condition and growth of fishes (Richard et al., 1991; Buckley et al., 1999; Zhou et al., \n2001) exploiting the fact that the concentration of DNA in somatic tissues is relatively constant \nwhereas the concentration of RNA is proportional to the amount of protein synthesis taking place \n(Clemmesen, 1994; Ch\u00edcharo and Ch\u00edcharo, 2008). In three-spined sticklebacks the somatic \nRNA:DNA ratio has been shown to be correlated with growth rate (Ali and Wootton, 1998, 2003) \nand to decline markedly during fasting (Pottinger et al., 2002). The RNA:DNA ratio provides a \n20 \n \nuseful adjunct to other somatic data by providing information on growth status related to conditions \npertaining at the time of capture of the individual. In the present study the RNA:DNA ratios of the \ntwo populations tended to vary with the annual temperature cycle and confirmed that fish in the R. \nRay experienced a longer growing season than those in the R. Ock. The RNA:DNA ratio for fish in \nthe R. Ray showed a progressive increase between November 2007 until the summer of 2008 \nwhereas for fish from the R. Ock during this period the RNA:DNA ratio did not increase until \nbetween March and May 2008. This 4 month period of stasis in anabolic activity in the R. Ock \nprobably reflected a combination of limited food supply in the R. Ock during the winter, and low \nwater temperature, which ranged between daily means of 2.9 \u2013 10.5oC during November \u2013 March in \nthe R. Ock in contrast to higher temperatures in the R. Ray of 7.5 \u2013 14.1oC during the same period. \nThe range of mean RNA:DNA ratios observed in this study (~1.0 - ~3.0) was similar to those \nobserved in laboratory studies in which sticklebacks were provided with maintenance rations (Ali \nand Wootton, 1998) but were lower than those reported for studies in which ration size was larger \n(Ali and Wootton, 1998, 2003). In the R. Ock, the broad pattern of change in RNA:DNA ratio was \nsimilar in both 2007 and 2008, with maximum activity occurring in April\/May followed by a steady \ndecline through to November and this pattern was also observed in fish from the R. Ray in 2007. \nHowever, during the post-remediation period RNA:DNA ratios did not decline after May in fish in \nthe R. Ray but instead remained at a similar level until November. This observation may be tied \nclosely with the higher specific growth rates exhibited by juvenile fish in the R. Ray during this \nperiod in 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. \n \nIn this context it should be noted that DO concentrations in the R. Ray prior to the GAC plant \ncoming online, were lower than those in the R. Ock, but markedly improved after installation of the \nGAC system, possibly due to a reduced biological oxygen demand. The extent to which the DO \nconcentrations at Rodbourne WWTW were representative of those further downstream of the \nWWTW was not documented but the effluent-induced  temperature differential between the R. Ock \n21 \n \nand R. Ray was sustained throughout all sample sites. The net effect on the fish population in the R. \nRay of increasing DO concentrations is likely to have been beneficial. Hypoxia has been reported to \nadversely affect reproductive processes in fish (Wu et al., 2003) and although a DO concentration in \nthe order of 70% saturation (~ 6.5 mg \/ litre O2 at 20\u00b0C) is unlikely to be directly harmful to \nsticklebacks, the interactive effects of concurrent exposure to chemical contaminants, elevated \nwater temperature and reduced oxygen availability may be of functional significance. The \npossibility that increased DO had a positive effect on factors indirectly affecting performance of the \nsticklebacks (e.g. the food supply) must also be considered. \n \n4.4. Biomarkers of chemical exposure \n \nAlterations in the chemical composition of the WWTW effluent may have affected the fish in the R. \nRay indirectly, via effects on the abundance of food items. However, direct adverse effects on \ngrowth in fish are reported for exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of a wide range of aquatic \ncontaminants (e.g. Alvarez and Fuiman, 2005; Amara et al., 2009) including sewage effluent (Ma et \nal., 2005) so this cause cannot be excluded. Prior to 2008 the Rodbourne effluent contained a \nmixture of organic chemicals including steroid estrogens (estrone, estradiol-17\u03b2, 17\u03b1-\nethinylestradiol), anti-androgens, personal care products (triclosan), pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, \nnaproxen, ketoprofen), phenols (octylphenol, bisphenol-A) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons \n(PAHs) (Readman et al., unpublished data). No evidence of endocrine disruption or anomalous \ngonadal structure attributable to estrogenic or androgenic  influence was detected among fish in the \nR. Ray (Katsiadaki et al., unpublished). However, the broader functional consequences for fish of \nexposure to a complex mixture of chemicals, particularly where most individual components of the \nmixture are present at levels below those recognised as harmful, is uncertain.  \n \n4.4.1. EROD activity \n22 \n \nMeasurement of the activity of cytochrome P450 isoform CYP1A is widely employed to evaluate \nthe exposure of fish to planar organic contaminants (Whyte et al, 2000). This isoform is induced by \ndioxins, dibenzofurans, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), PAHs, and other compounds that bind to \nthe aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Measurement of the activity of the monooxygenase 7-\nethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) provides a surrogate for direct quantification of CYP1A \nexpression. In the present investigation, assessment of both EROD activity and CYP1A gene \nexpression was conducted to evaluate the status of CYP1A-inducing chemicals in the WWTW \neffluent after remediation.  \n \nEROD activity was quantified in fish from the two rivers immediately prior to and following \ncommissioning of the GAC plant (January and March 2008 respectively). The mean EROD activity \nlevels reported here (1-13 pmol min-1 mg protein-1) are comparable with the lower range of EROD \nactivities, of between 2.6 and 43.3 pmol min-1 mg protein-1, that have been reported for sticklebacks \nexposed to varying degrees of chemical contamination (Sanchez et al., 2007; Wartman et al., 2009). \nActivity in the range 0.5 - 10 pmol min-1 mg protein-1 has been reported for laboratory controls and \nsticklebacks from ostensibly unpolluted sites (Geoghegan et al., 2008; Sanchez et al., 2008a). \nAlthough low in comparison to these reported ranges of activity, during January 2008 EROD \nactivity in fish from the R. Ray was nonetheless markedly higher than that in fish from the R. Ock, \nsuggesting a difference in chemical loading between the rivers. Approximately one month \nfollowing the GAC upgrade on the R. Ray no decline in EROD activity in sampled fish was \nevident. This may reflect the relatively short period elapsed since commissioning of the GAC plant, \nor that the WWTW effluent was not the primary cause of the EROD response. If the WWTW was \nthe major source of EROD-inducing chemicals in the R. Ray, and WWTW effluent is certainly \ndocumented as an inducer of CYP1A activity in fish (e.g. McArdle et al., 2000), a sustained \nresponse might also have arisen if the exposure route of the fish was not primarily via the water \ncolumn but instead via ingestion of contaminated food items and thus more closely linked to the \n23 \n \nchemicals associated with the sediments and detritus (O\u2019Hara and Penczak, 1987; Gewurtz et al., \n2000; Rice et al., 2000; Meril\u00e4inen and Oikari, 2008). During the period in which fish populations \nwere monitored, sediment PAH concentrations were highest at Elborough Bridge (EB; the first site \ndownstream of the WWTW) lower at Seven Bridges (7B; the site most distant from the WWTW on \nthe Ray) and were lower than both these at Charney Bassett (CB) on the R. Ock (Readman et al, \nunpublished data). EROD activity in fish from the R. Ock matched or exceeded that observed in \nfish from the R. Ray during March 2008. This represented an approximately 12-fold increase over \nvalues in January 2008. It is unlikely that seasonal variation in enzyme activity alone could account \nfor this change. In an earlier study no substantial seasonal variation in EROD activity was observed \nin sticklebacks between April and October (Sanchez et al., 2008b). Instead it is more probable that \nfish in the R. Ock were exposed to a chemical challenge of unknown origin between January and \nMarch 2008. This supposition is supported by consideration of the CYP1A expression data. \n \n4.4.2. CYP1A expression \nLevels of CYP1A expression showed little change in fish from the R. Ray between the pre- and \npost-remediation periods, consistent with the pattern of EROD activity. Expression of CYP1A in \nfish from the R. Ock was higher during 2008 than 2007 and significantly higher overall than that in \nfish from the R. Ray during 2008 which was again consistent with the EROD results. Expression of \nCYP1A varied significantly between sites on the R. Ray, exhibiting a similar pattern in 2007 and \n2008. If the variation apparent in CYP1A expression was primarily a function of  exposure of the \nfish to chemical contaminants then the higher CYP1A expression levels in fish captured at sites \ndownstream of the WWTW suggests that the primary route of exposure was not to chemicals \ndissolved in the water column, or that the WWTW was not the only source of CYP1A-inducing \nchemicals on the R. Ray. Concentrations of chemicals in the water column tended to be highest at \nthe point of discharge but were sustained downstream with relatively little decline as far as the \nSeven Bridges site 9.5 km from the point of discharge (e.g. bisphenol-A, estradiol-17\u03b2; Readman et \n24 \n \nal., unpublished data; Grover et al., unpublished data; Balaam et al., 2010). However, the \nconcentrations of most chemicals detected in sediment samples were higher at Elborough Bridge \nand Seven Bridges, the second and fourth sites downstream of the WWTW, than in samples \ncollected immediately downstream of the WWTW (e.g. PAHs; Readman et al., unpublished data) \nmatching more closely the pattern of CYP1A expression. Persistence of contaminants in the \nsediment might explain why no decline in EROD and CYP1A activity was detected in fish from the \nR. Ray after the GAC plant was commissioned, if the primary route of exposure for the fish was via \ningestion of contaminated benthic invertebrates (Logan, 2007). It also suggests that exposure of the \nresident fish populations to contaminants may continue for some time after remediation of the \nWWTW effluent as the sediment-associated contamination depurates. However, CYP1A induction \nis a specific response to only a sub-set of the chemical contaminants present in the pre-remediation \nWWTW effluent and a positive response post-remediation does not mean that exposure to the entire \nsuite of contaminants continued after installation of the GAC plant.  \n \nThe higher CYP1A expression levels in fish taken from the R. Ock in 2008 compared to 2007 \ntogether with the elevated EROD activity detected in fish from the R. Ock during 2008 suggest fish \nin the R. Ock during this period were exposed to an increased level of chemical contamination. The \nCharney Bassett (CB), Garford (GAR) and Marcham Mill (MM) sites were on the R. Ock, whereas \nthe Venn Mill (VM) site was on the conjoining Childrey Brook so a localised upstream point source \nof contamination seems unlikely. It may be the case that sufficient road run-off entered both rivers \nduring periods of high rainfall to raise the levels of PAHs and other chemicals. In sediments \ncollected during 2007 three PAHs identified with road run-off (pyrene, fluoranthene, phenanthrene; \nBoxall and Maltby, 1997) were quantitatively dominant at sites on the R. Ray (urban) but were \npresent at very much lower concentrations in the R. Ock (Readman et al., unpublished data).  \n \n \n25 \n \n5.  Conclusion \n \nTwo indicators of performance in the resident stickleback population in the R. Ray, specific growth \nrate and RNA:DNA ratio, were higher in fish downstream of a municipal WWTW in the period \nfollowing the installation of a tertiary GAC process than during the equivalent period prior to \nremediation of the effluent. This improvement in performance may have been related to the \nelimination of direct effects on the fish of a complex effluent-derived chemical challenge, or may \nhave arisen due to indirect factors such as the increase in dissolved oxygen concentrations following \nremediation, or effects of effluent remediation on food abundance. The changes in performance \ndetected in fish from the R. Ray were apparent despite evidence from specific biomarkers that \nexposure to some chemical contaminants, possibly via the ingestion of sediment-associated food \nitems, was sustained into the post-remediation period. It was not possible to directly compare the \nstickleback population in the R. Ray with that in the R. Ock, a river in close proximity to the study \nsite but unaffected by WWTW discharges, because of the higher water temperature and nutrient \nloading in the R. Ray brought about by the effluent which resulted in very different population \nstructures and growth profiles for the two rivers. In the R. Ock the population growth profile \ndiffered between years and both biomarkers of chemical exposure that were measured indicated that \nduring the second year fish in the R. Ock were exposed to a chemical challenge of a similar \nmagnitude to that experienced by fish in the R. Ray. The  findings suggest that remediation of the \nWWTW effluent had a positive effect on growth in the first post-remediation generation, implying \nthat the pre-remediation effluent was exerting a constraint on performance. This was offset by the \nbroadly positive effects on growth of higher temperatures and nutrient loading. The results suggest \nthat the accurate assessment and attribution of subtle effects of anthropogenic activities on a \nriverine fish population may be compromised by the complexity and number of interacting factors \nthat must be taken into consideration. \n  \n26 \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors thank David Abel (CEH) and Matthew Sanders (Cefas) for their technical assistance. \nThis study was funded by the U.K. Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), \nand the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).  \n \nReferences \n \nAli M, Wootton RJ.
