Mobility tracking involves on-line estimation\nof the position and speed of a mobile unit.

Data from two\ntypes of stations are usually used: base stations which po-\nsition is known and mobile stations (or mobile users) which\nlocation and dynamic motion is being estimated.\nMobility tracking techniques can be divided in two\ngroups [1]: methods in which the position, speed, and ac-\nceleration are estimated versus conventional geo-location\ntechniques, which only estimate the position coordinates.\nApproaches for mobility tracking rely on Kalman filtering\n[1, 2, 3, 1], hidden semi-Markov models [4, 5, 3] and se-\nquential Monte Carlo filtering [6]. Two types of measure-\nments can be used: pilot signal strengths from different base\nstations measured at the mobile unit and the corresponding\npropagating times.\nThe Kalman-filtering algorithms developed in [1] for\nreal-time tracking of the location and dynamic motion of a\nmobile station in a cellular network have all limitations and\nadvantages coming from the Kalman filtering framework:\nnecessity of linearisation and the coming from this inaccu-\nracies. The two algorithms proposed in [1] use the pilot\nsignal strengths from neighbouring base stations, i.e., the\nReceived Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), although they\nare suitable for signal measurements such as time-of-arrival\n(TOA) information. The mobility model is linear driven\nby a discrete command process that determines the mobile\nstation\u2019s acceleration. The command process is modelled\nas a semi-Markov process over a finite set of acceleration\nlevels. The first algorithm consists of an averaging filter\nfor processing pilot signal strength measurements and two\nKalman filters, one to estimate the discrete command pro-\ncess and the other to estimate the mobility state. The sec-\nond algorithm employs a single Kalman filter without pre-\nfiltering the measurements and is able to track a mobile sta-\ntion even when a limited set of pilot signal measurements\nis available. Both of the proposed algorithms can be used\nto predict future mobility behaviour, which can be used to\nresource allocation applications.\nYang and Wang [6] developed a Monte Carlo algorithm\nfor joint mobility tracking and hard handoff detection in\ncellular networks. In their work mobility tracking involves\non-line estimation of the location and speed of the mobile,\nwhereas handoff detection involves on-line prediction of the\npilot signal strength at some future time instants. The opti-\nmal solution of both problems is prohibitively complex due\nto the nonlinear nature of the system.\nIn this paper we focus on mobility tracking based on sig-\nnal strength measurements. In contrast to previous works\n[1, 2, 7, 6] mobility tracking in cellular networks is formu-\nlated here as an estimation problem of hybrid systems which\nare systems with a base state vector and a mode (modal)\nstate vector. The base states are continuously evolving,\nwhilst the modal states can undergo abrupt changes. This\nformulation together with the sequential Monte Carlo ap-\nproach provides us with a powerful tool for mobility track-\ning. A particle filter and a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter\nare developed and their performance investigated.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 contains\nthe problem formulation. Section 3 presents the mobility\nstate and observation models. The mobility tracking and\nprediction within Bayesian framework is given in section 4.\nA particle filter for mobility estimation in wireless cellular\nnetworks is presented in section 4 and a Rao-Blackwellised\nparticle filter is designed in Section 5. Their performance\nevaluation is given in Section 7. Conclusions and ongoing\nresearch issues are highlighted in the last Section 8.\n0-7803-9286-8\/05\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\n2 Problem Formulation\nWe consider the mobility tracking in cellular networks\nwithin the sequential Monte Carlo framework. The dynam-\nics of the mobility unit is described by the equation\nxk = f(xk\u22121,uk(mk),wk(mk)), (1)\nwhere xk \u2208 Rnx is the system base state, mk \u2208 Rnm is the\nmodal state, uk \u2208 Rnu specifies the command process, and\nwk \u2208 Rnx is the state noise, with k \u2208 N being the discrete\ntime and N is the set of natural numbers. The measurement\nequation is in the form\nzk = h(xk,vk), (2)\nwhere zk \u2208 Rnz is the observation, and vk \u2208 Rnv is the\nmeasurement noise. Functions f(.) and h(.) are nonlinear\nin general.\nAssume that the observations are taken at discrete time\npoints T.k, with a discretisation time step T . A mobile user\nmay have abrupt and unexpected changes in acceleration\nuk caused by different reasons such as traffic lights, road\nturns. On the other hand, the acceleration of the mobile is\nhighly correlated. In order to model these both sides, fol-\nlowing [6, 2, 7] we model the moving user as a dynamic\nsystem driven by a command uk = (ux,k, uy,k)\u2032 and a cor-\nrelated random acceleration rk = (rx,k, ry,k)\u2032 at time k,\ni.e. the total acceleration is ak = uk + rk (see Fig. 1).\n \nka  \nkr\ntime correlated  \nrandom acceleration \nku  \ncommands \n1m  \n2m  \nMm  \nFig. 1: Structure of the mobility acceleration chain\nThe purpose is to estimate the current state of the moving\nobject on the basis of the measurements. Since the mea-\nsurement function is highly nonlinear and the measurement\nerrors are big, we propose a solution to the problem within\nthe sequential Monte Carlo framework.\n3 Mobility State and Observation Models\nDifferent state mobility models were previously used in cel-\nlular networks such as the constant acceleration model [6]\nand Singer-type models [3, 1]. In this paper we choose a\ndiscrete-time Singer model [1] because it captures corre-\nlated accelerations and allows for prediction of position,\nspeed, and acceleration of mobile users. Originally pro-\nposed by Singer [8] for tracking targets in military systems,\nthe Singer model has served as a basis for developing many\neffective maneuver models with various applications (see\n[9] for a detailed survey), including for user mobility pat-\nterns. In the original Singer model the command input is\nsupposed to be a Markov process, which has a time auto-\ncorrelation, whilst the Singer-type model from [1] includes\na command process in explicit form.\nFor the sake of conciseness here we present directly the\ndiscrete-time form of this Singer-type model. The deriva-\ntion of the discrete-time model from the corresponding\ncontinuous-time model is given in [1]. The state of the\nmoving mobile at time instant k is defined by the vector\nxk = (xk, x\u02d9k, x\u00a8k, yk, y\u02d9k, y\u00a8k)\u2032 where xk and yk specify\nthe position, x\u02d9k and y\u02d9k specify the speed, and x\u00a8k and y\u00a8k\nspecify the acceleration in the x and y directions in a two-\ndimensional grid.\nThe motion of the mobility user can be described by the\nequation\nxk = A(T, \u03b1)xk\u22121 + B(T, \u03b1)uk + wk, (3)\nwhere uk = (ux,k, uy,k)\u2032 is a discrete-time command pro-\ncess, the respective matrices in (3) are of the form\nA(T, \u03b1) =\n(\nA\u02dc 03\u00d73\n03\u00d73 A\u02dc\n)\n,B(T, \u03b1) =\n(\nB\u02dc 03\u00d71\n03\u00d71 B\u02dc\n)\n,\n(4)\nA\u02dc =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed1 T a0 1 b\n0 0 e\u2212\u03b1T\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , B\u02dc =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed c\u03b1a\n\u03b1b\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , (5)\nwith a = (\u22121 + \u03b1T + e\u2212\u03b1T )\/\u03b12, b = (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1T )\/\u03b1,\nc = (1 \u2212 \u03b1T + \u03b122 T 2 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1T )\/\u03b12 . The random process\nwk is a 6\u00d7 1 vector, T is the discretisation period, and \u03b1 is\nthe reciprocal of the autocorrelation of the acceleration time\nconstant. Since wk is a white noise, E[wkwk+i] = 0, for\ni \u0002= 0. The covariance matrix Q of wk is Q = 2\u03b1\u03c321I2 \u2297\nQ1(T ), where I denotes the unit matrix, \u2297 the Kronecker\nproduct. The errors in xk and yk direction are assumed\nthe same (see [1] for details) and are characterised with the\nstandard deviation \u03c31. The matrix Q1(T ) is symmetric,\nwith dimension 3\u00d7 3 and entries having the form:\nq11 = (1\u2212 e\u22122\u03b1T + 2\u03b1T + 2\u03b13T 3\/3\u2212 2\u03b12T 2\n\u22124\u03b1Te\u2212\u03b1T )\/(2\u03b15), (6)\nq12 = (e\u22122\u03b1T + 1\u2212 2e\u2212\u03b1T + 2\u03b1Te\u2212\u03b1T (7)\n\u22122\u03b1T + \u03b12T 2)\/(2\u03b14), (8)\nq13 = (1\u2212 e\u22122\u03b1T \u2212 2\u03b1Te\u2212\u03b1T )\/(2\u03b13), (9)\nq22 = (4e\u2212\u03b1T \u2212 3\u2212 e\u22122\u03b1T + 2\u03b1T )\/(2\u03b13), (10)\nq23 = (e\u22122\u03b1T + 1\u2212 2e\u2212\u03b1T )\/(2\u03b12), (11)\nq33 = (1\u2212 e\u22122\u03b1T )\/(2\u03b1). (12)\nThe unknown command processes ux,k and uy,k are mod-\nelled as a first-order Markov chain that takes values from\na set of acceleration levels A = {m1, . . . ,mM}, and the\nprocess uk takes values from the set M = Ax \u00d7Ay , with\ntransition probabilities \u03c0ij = P (uk = mj |uk\u22121 = mi)\nand initial probability distribution \u00b5i,0 = P{m = mi} for\nmodes mi \u2208 A such that \u00b5i,0 \u2265 0 and\n\u2211M\ni=1 \u00b5i,0 = 1.\n3.1 Observation Model\nA commonly used model [1, 6] in cellular networks for\nthe distance between a mobile and a given base station (BS)\nrelies on the received signal strength indication (RSSI),\nwhich is the average of the pilot signal strength received at\nthe mobiles. Denote zk,i the observation, the RSSI signal\nreceived by a given mobile from the i-th BS with coordi-\nnates (ai, bi) at time k. The RSSI can be modelled as a\nsum of two terms: one due to path loss, and another due\nto shadow fading. Fast fading is neglected assuming that a\nlow-pass filter is used to attenuate the Rayleigh or Rician\nfade. Therefore, the RSSI (measured at dB) that the mo-\nbile unit receives from a particular BS i at time k, can be\nmodelled as the following function\nzk,i = z0,i \u2212 10\u03b7log10(dk,i)1\/2 + vk,i, (13)\nwhere z0,i is a constant determined by the transmitted\npower, wavelength, antenna height, and gain of cell i; \u03b7 is\na slope index (typically \u03b7 = 2 for highways and \u03b7 = 4 for\nmicrocells in a city); dk,i =\n\u221a\n(xk \u2212 ai)2 + (yk \u2212 bi)2 is\nthe distance between the mobile unit and the base station;\n(ai, bi) is the position of the i-th base station; vk,i is the\nlogarithm of the shadowing component, which is found to\nbe a zero mean, stationary Gaussian process with standard\ndeviation \u03c3v,i, typically from 4 \u2013 8 dB [2]. The shadowing\ncomponent can considerably worsen the estimation process\nas it is shown in [3, 1]. This difficulty can be overcome by\npre-filtering the measurements (e.g. by an averaging filter)\nin order to reduce the observation noise.\nTo locate the mobile station in a two-dimensional plane,\nthree distance measurements to neighboring BSs are suf-\nficient. The necessary data are available in GSM systems\nwhere within regular intervals the mobile samples the for-\nward signal levels of six neighbour links. For the consid-\nered problem the observation vector consists of the three\nlargest RSSI denoted zk,1, zk,2, zk,3. Hence, the measure-\nment equation is of the form\nzk = h(xk) + vi,k, (14)\nwith h(xk) = (h1(xk), h2 (xk), h3(xk))\u2032 , hi(xi,k) =\nz0,i \u2212 10\u03b7log(dk,i) a measurement vector\nzk = (zk,1, zk,2, zk,3)\u2032, shadowing components\nvk,i = (vk,1, vk,2, vk,3)\u2032 assumed to be uncorrelated\nboth in time and space, and having Gaussian distribution,\nvk,i = N (0, \u03c32v).\n4 Mobility Tracking and Prediction within\nBayesian Framework\nNow we look at the real-time estimation of the mobility of\na user within the Bayesian framework. Since the command\nprocess u is unknown, a hybrid particle xk = {xk,mk}\nis considered that fully characterises the target state and\nmode. The mobility state xk can be evaluated at each time\ninstant from the conditional probability density function\np(xk|z1:k) and a set of measurements z1:k \u0001 {z1, . . . ,zk}\nup to time instant k according to the Chapman-Kolmogorov\nequation\np(xk|z1:k\u22121) =\n\u222b\nRnx\np(xk|xk\u22121)p(xk\u22121|z1:k\u22121)dxk\u22121.\n(15)\nAfter the arrival of the measurement zk at time k, the poste-\nrior state probability density function (pdf) can be updated\nvia Bayes\u2019 rule\np(xk|z1:k) = p(zk|xk)p(xk|z1:k\u22121)\np(zk|z1:k\u22121) , (16)\nwhere p(zk|z1:k\u22121) is a normalising constant. The analyt-\nical solution to the above equations is very difficult and in-\ntractable. We utilise the Monte Carlo technique [10] which\nhas proven to be very suitable and powerful for dealing with\nnonlinear system dynamics.\nThe Monte Carlo approach relies on a sample-based con-\nstruction of these probability density functions. Multiple\nparticles (samples) of the variables of interest are generated,\neach one associated with a weight characterising the quality\nof a specific particle. An estimate of the variable of interest\nis obtained by the weighted sum of particles. Two major\nstages can be distinguished : prediction and update. Dur-\ning the prediction each particle is modified according to the\nstate model, including the addition of random noise in order\nto simulate the effect of the noise on the variable of interest.\nIn the update stage, each particle\u2019s weight is re-evaluated\nbased on the new sensor data. The resampling procedure is\ndealing with the elimination of particles with small weights\nand replicates the particles with higher weights.\n4.1 A Particle Filter for Mobility Tracking\nThe developed particle filter (PF) is based on multiple mod-\nels for the unknown acceleration u. Denote with N the\nnumber of particles of the PF. A detailed scheme of the fil-\nter is given in Table 1.\nTable 1. A particle filter for mobility tracking\nInitialisation\n1. k = 0, for j = 1, . . . , N ,\ngenerate samples {x(j)0 \u223c p(x0),m(j)0 \u223c P0(m) },\nwhere P0(m) are the initial mode probabilities for the accel-\nerations and set initial weights W (j) = 1\/N .\nPrediction Step\n2. For k = 1, 2, . . . , j = 1, . . . , N ,\ngenerate samples\nx\n(j)\nk = A(T, \u03b1)x\n(j)\nk\u22121 + B(T )u\n(j)(m\n(j)\nk ) + w\n(j)\nk ,\nwhere w(j)k \u223c N (0,Q(j)(0,m(j)k )),\nm\n(j)\nk \u223c {\u03c0\u0001m}M\u0001=1, m = 1, . . . ,M for \u0003 = m(j)k\u22121;\nMeasurement Update: evaluate the importance weights\n3. On the receipt of a new measurement, compute the weights\nW\n(j)\nk = W\n(j)\nk\u22121L(zk|x(j)k ). (17)\nThe likelihood L(zk|x(j)k ) is calculated from (14)\nL(zk|x(j)k ) \u223c N (h(x(j)k ), \u03c3v).\n4. Normalise the weights, W\u02c6 (j)k = W\n(j)\nk \/\n\u2211N\nj=1 W\n(j)\nk .\nOutput\n5.

P (mk = \u0003|z1:k) =\n\u2211N\nj=1 1(m\n(j)\nk = \u0003)W\u02c6\n(j)\nk ,\nwhere 1(.) is an indicator function such that\n1(mk = \u0003) = 1, if mk = \u0003,\nand 1(mk = \u0003) = 0 otherwise.\nCompute the effective sample size\n7.

Multiply\/ suppress samples {x(j)k ,m(j)k } with high\/ low im-\nportance weights W\u02c6 (j)k , in order to obtain N new random\nsamples approximately distributed according to the poste-\nrior state distribution. The residual resampling algorithm\n[11, 12] is applied. This is a two step process making use\nof sampling-importance-resampling scheme.\n* For i = 1, . . . , N , set W (j)k = W\u02c6\n(j)\nk = 1\/N .\n9. Set k \u2192 k + 1 and return to step 2.\n5 A Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter for\nMobility Tracking\nA major drawback of the particle filtering over sensor net-\nworks is that it might become prohibitively expensive when\na large number of particles is used. The mobility track-\ning algorithm has to possess such computational complex-\nity that allows an on-line implementation. The complexity\ncan be reduced and the estimation accuracy improved by a\nprocedure called Rao-Blackwellisation [13, 14, 15, 16, 17,\n18, 19].\nRao-Blackwellisation is a technique improving particle\nfiltering by analytically marginalising out some of the vari-\nables (linear, Gaussian) from the joint posterior distribution,\nand then the linear part of the system model is estimated by\na Kalman filter (KF), an optimal estimatior, whilst the non-\nlinear part is estimated by a PF. This leads to the fact that\na KF is attached to each particle. In the mobility tracking\nproblem the positions of the mobile unit are estimated with\na PF, the speeds and accelerations with a KF. Since the mea-\nsurement equation is highly nonlinear, the particle filter is\nused to approximate this distribution. After the estimation\nof the positions, these estimates are given to the KF as mea-\nsurements. As a result of the marginalisation, the variance\nof the estimates is reduced compared to the standard PF.\nRather similar to the Rao-Blackwellisation approach is\nthe mixture Kalman filtering approach proposed by Chen\nand Liu [20] where the system is represented by a lin-\near conditional dynamic model and this way the problem\nis solved by multiple Kalman filters run with the Monte\nCarlo sampling approach. A formulation of the Rao-\nBlackwellisation problem is done also in [21, 22] in a more\ndifferent way compared to [15].\nThe mobility model (1)-(2) is rewritten in the form\n(\nxpfk\nxkfk\n)\n=\n(\nI Apf\n0 Akf\n)(\nxpfk\u22121\nxkfk\u22121\n)\n+\n(\nBpfu\nBkfu\n)\nuk\n+\n(\nBpfw\nBkfw\n)\nwk, (19)\nzk = h(x\npf\nk ) + vk, (20)\nwhere xpf (pf short for particle filter) and xkf (kf short\nfor Kalman filter) is a partition of the state vector with w\nassumed Gaussian. Assume that equations (19)-(20) have\nthe same properties like equations (1)-(2). Since the noise\nwk is Gaussian,\nwk =\n(\nwpfk\nwkfk\n)\n\u2208 N \u223c (0,Q),Q =\n(\nQpf Mpf\n(Mpf )\u2032 Qkf\n)\n.\n(21)\nInstead of directly estimating the pdf p(xk|z1:k), with the\nentire state vector, consider the pdf p(xpfk ,x\nkf\nk |z1:k). Us-\ning the Bayes rule, this pdf can be factorised into two parts\naccording to\np(xpfk ,x\nkf\nk |z1:k) = p(xkfk |xpfk ,z1:k)p(xpf |z1:k). (22)\nSince the measurements z1:k are conditionally independent\non xkfk , the probability p(x\nkf\nk |xpfk ,z1:k) can be written as\np(xkfk |xpfk ,z1:k) = p(xkfk |xpfk ). (23)\nConsider now the system\nxkfk = A\nkfxkfk\u22121 + B\nkf\nu uk + B\nkf\nw w\nkf\nk ,\nzk = Apfx\nkf\nk\u22121 + B\npf\nu uk + B\npf\nw w\npf\nk , (24)\nwhere zk = xpfk \u2212 f(xpfk ). Since the system (24) is linear\nand Gaussian, the optimal solution is provided by the KF.\nWe can assume a Gaussian form of the pdf (23), i.e.\np(xkfk |xpfk ) \u223c N (x\u02c6kfk|k\u22121,P kfk|k\u22121), (25)\nwhere the estimate vector x\u02c6kfk|k\u22121 and the corresponding co-\nvariance matrix P kfk|k\u22121 are calculated by the Kalman filter.\nThe mobility model is a Singer-type model which ac-\ncounts for correlations between the state vector compo-\nnents. Hence, we cannot assume that the process noise wpf\nis uncorrelated with wkf , i.e. M \u0002= 0.\nThe second pdf from (22) can be written recursively [14]\np(xpfk |z1:k) =\np(zk|xpfk )p(xpfk |xpf1:k\u22121)\np(zk|z1:k\u22121) p(x\npf\n1:k\u22121|z1:k\u22121).\n(26)\nDue to the nonlinear measurement equation we apply a\nPF to solve (26). The weights are recursively calculated\nbased on the likelihoods p(zk|xpf,(j)k ). The particles will\nbe sampled according to p(xpf,(j)k |xpf,(j)1:k\u22121). Using the state\nequation for the xpf from (19) and having in mind (25), the\nprediction step in the particle filter can be done as follows\nx\npf,(j)\nk+1 \u223c N (xpf,(j)k + Apf x\u02c6kf,(j)k|k\u22121 + Bpfu u(j)k+1,\nApfP\nkf,(j)\nk|k\u22121(A\npf )\u2032 + Bpfw Q\npf,(j)(Bpfw )\n\u2032. (27)\nFor each particle, one Kalman filter estimates\nx\nkf,(j)\nk+1|k, j = 1, . . . , N . It should be noted that the\nprediction of the nonlinear variables is used to improve the\nestimates of the linear state variables.\nTable 2 presents the developed Rao-Blackwellised Particle\nFilter (RBPF).\nTable 2.

In a general prediction problem we\nare interested in computing the posterior r-step ahead pre-\ndiction distribution p(xk+r|z1:k) given by ([21, 6])\np(xk+r|z1:k) =\n\u222b\nRnx\np(xk|z1:k)\n[\nk+r\u220f\ni=k+1\ndxk:k+r\u22121\n]\n,\n(41)\nwhere xk+r = {xk,uk, . . . ,xk+r,uk+r}. The integrals in\n(41) can be evaluated using the evolution equation (3), resp.\n(19). Then the solution to the r step ahead prediction can\nbe given by performing the steps from Table 3.\nTable 3. r step ahead prediction\n\u2022 For i = 1, . . . , r, For j = 1, 2, . . . , N , sample\nx\n(j)\nk+i = A(T, \u03b1)x\n(j)\nk+i\u22121+B(T )u\n(j)(mk+i)+w\n(j)\nk+i,\nwhere w(j)k+i \u223c N (0,Q(j)(0,m(j)k+i)),\nm\n(j)\nk+i \u223c {\u03c0\u0002m}M\u0002=1, m = 1, . . . ,M for \u0005 = m(j)k+i\u22121;\nThen the predicted state estimate of the mobile unit is\nequal to\nx\u02c6k+r\/k =\nNmc\u2211\nj=1\nW\n(j)\nk x\n(j)\nk+r\/k. (42)\n6 Performance Evaluation\nThe developed Monte Carlo algorithms are evaluated over\na conventional hexagon cellular network (similar to those\nin [6]). It is supposed that a map of the cellular network is\navailable and the centre coordinates of the base stations are\nknown.\n7 Synthetic Data Example\nThe simulated service area contains 64 base stations with\ncell radius of 2 km, as shown in Fig. 2. The mobile can\nmove to any cell of the network with varying speed and\nacceleration. The discrete-time command processes ux,k\nand uy,k can change within the range [\u22127 m\/s2, 7 m\/s2].\nThese commands ux,k and uy,k are assumed in the filters\nto be independent Markov processes, each of them taking\nvalues between the following acceleration levels\nAx = {0, 0, 1, \u22121, 0, 1, \u22121, 1, \u22121, 2.5, (43)\n\u2212 2.5, 2.5, \u22122.5, 5, \u22125, \u22125, 5},\nAy = {0, 1, 0, 0, \u22121, 1, 1, \u22121, \u22121, 2.5, (44)\n\u2212 2.5, \u22122.5, 2.5, 5, \u22125, 5, \u22125},\nin units of [m\/s2]. The simulated trajectory of the mo-\nbile is generated according to the mobility model (3) and\nwith this trajectory the RSSI signals are randomly gener-\nated according to the observation equation (14) with differ-\nent noises for each simulation run. The randomness of the\nRSSI comes from the randomness of the shadowing com-\nponent. At any sampling time, the observed RSSI signal is\nchosen to be the three largest signal powers among all 64\nBSs in the network. The simulation parameters are sum-\nmarised in Table 4. Additionally we take into account that\nthe estimated speed v\u02c6 and acceleration a\u02c6 can not exceed\ncertain physical limits, i.e. v\u02c6 =\n\u221a\n\u02c6\u02d9x2 + \u02c6\u02d9y2 \u2208 [0, 45] [m\/s],\na\u02c6 =\n\u221a\n\u02c6\u00a8x2 + \u02c6\u00a8y2 \u2208 [\u22125, 5] [m\/s2].

Their performance has\nbeen evaluated over a synthetic data example. The Rao-\nBlackwellised particle filter allows to decrease the compu-\ntational complexity by reducing the number of required par-\nticles and shows slightly superior results to the particle filter\nin terms of accuracy.\nOpen issues for future research are investigation of the\nMonte Carlo framework for mobility tracking in ad hoc mo-\nbile wireless networks with different propagation models,\ndifferent scenarios with single and multiple mobile units.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research is supported by the the UK MOD Data and In-\nformation Fusion Defence Technology Center and in part by the\nBulgarian Foundation for Scientific Investigations under grants I-\n1202\/02 and I-1205\/02.\nReferences\n[1] Z.
