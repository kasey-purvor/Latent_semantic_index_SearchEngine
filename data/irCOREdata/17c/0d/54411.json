INTRODUCTION \nWith servo drive systems continually improving in \nperformance capability, improved control of the \nelectromechanical system dynamics is becoming an \nincreasingly common industrial requirement. Uowever, \nimpulsive transient demands from such systems can excite \nmechanical torsional resonances in the associated drive- \ntrain, ultimately leading to controller instability. Practical \nmechanical drive systems can be complex, incorporating \nseveral non-stiff interconnecting shafts and elastic couplings. \nThe dominant fundamental resonant frequency, however. is \ntypically between <3WHz, which often overlaps with the \nclosed-loop dynamic bandwidth imposed by the control \nscheme. The higher resonant modes often remain relatively \nunexcited, allowing a large proportion of typical industrial \ndrive systems to be accurately modelled using a two-inertia \napproximation. \nUntil recently, difficulties in acquiring reliable, low-noise, \nlow-cost, shaft torque transducers that are non-invasive to \nthe mechanical drive system, have precluded the use of \ndirect torque feedback i n  all hut a minority of specialised \nclosed-loop servo-drive systems. Often, commonly \nemployed torque transducers viz. strain gauge, optical and \ninductive devices, are too mechanically compliant when \nincorporated in a drive system, thereby degrading stability \nmargins and reducing closed-loop bandwidth. Moreover, \nthe additional cost associated with their integration is \nprohibitive. \nHere then, an investigation in applying a new, low-cost, \nnon-contact torque measurement device, based on surface \nacoustic wave (SAW) technology [I], is reported for use in \nhigh performance brushless machine-based servo \napplications. It will be shown that direct measurement of \nshaft torque, coupled with a resonance ratio control strategy \n[2-41. can significantly enhance servo-drive system \ndynamics. Additionally, the use of observers is presented to \ndirectly incorporate shaft-torque feedback to provide load- \nside torque disturbance rejection, and the ability to design \ncontrollers for independently satisfying closed-loop tracking, \nand regulation performance. Conventionally the closed-loop \ndynamics induced by the presence of a state observer is \noften ignored since the observer is usually designed to be \nmuch faster than the system dynamics. However in practice, \na fast Observer may lead to the undesirable amplification of \nhigh frequency noise particularly if the feedback sensors are \nnoisy (such a the speed output from a quantized encoder). \nThis paper therefore, provides a tuning methodology that \nconsiders the additional dynamics induced by the observer \nthus enabling a further reduction in observer speed. \nMoreover, since the SAW torque transducer exhibits a \nhigh sensitivity and bandwidth, and is largely unaffected by \nelectromagnetic noise, it can be directly integrated into an \nelectrical machine assembly without affecting the \nmechanical stiffness of the system. \n11. TWO-INERTIA MECHANICAL SYSTEM \nFig. I(a) shows the schematic of a mechanical system \ncontaining two lumped inertias J ,  and Jd representing the \nmotor and load, respectively. The inertias are coupled via a \nshaft of finite stiffness K d ,  which is subject lo torsional \ntorque td, and excited by a combination of electromagnetic \ntorque t,, and load torque perturbations td. The motor \nvelocity is designated U). (rads) and load velocity @(rads). \nSince the damping losses are generally low, they are \nneglected without significantly affecting the accuracy of the \nforgoing analysis [2-8]. \nFig. I(b) shows a dynamic model of the two-inertia \nmechanical servo-drive system.

Two-inertia servo-drive System \n111. PI & RRC CONTROL STRUCTURES \nA. Tracking dynamic performance \nA classical PI-type control structure is illustrated in Fig. \n2(a). This control structure can be extended by augmenting \na feedback signal proportional to shaft torque as illustrated \nFig. 2(b), the feedback transfer gain being K,. Applying a \nfeedback signal proportional to torsion in this manner is \ncommonly referred to as Resonance Ratio Control (RKC) 12- \nThe resulting closed-loop transfer functions from \nreference input to load speed (tracking dynamics) for both PI \nand KRC structures are given in (6 ) ,  with the equivalent \ninertia ratio, R given in (7) for completeness. It is noted that \nd+ R as K,+ 0. Tracking performance of the two control \nstructures are evaluated using the 'integral of time multiplied \nby absolute error' (ITAE) performance index for a step \ninput, to penalise overshoot and settling time for a specified \nrise-time or equivalent -3dB bandwidth 191. \nThe step tracking dynamics of the PI-type scheme of Fig. \n2(a), can be completely defined by the location of its closed- \nloop poles. Equating the coefficients of the characteristic \nequation (the denominator of (6) when K, = O), with the \ncoefficients of the 4*\"-order ITAE polynomial (8), the system \ncan be tuned for optimum performance, where y is the \nequivalent -3dB bandwidth. \n41. \n~ \n4579 \nAochen.

By analysing the closed-loop \npole restrictions, the load side tracking performance of the \nPI controller and two-inertia system shows an increasingly \nunderdamped response as R reduces from the optimal value, \nor as y becomes greater than 4. However, by using the \nRRC structure when R # 1, R can be virtually adjusted to d \nby the appropriate selection of K,, thereby theoretically \nproviding optimum performance for any R. Table I gives the \noptimal gains for the KRC controller. \nB. Regulation dynamic performance \nEquation (9) provides the closed-loop transfer function \nfrom disturbance torque to load speed (regulation dynamics), \n \n2004 35th A n n u l  IEEE Power Elecrronics Specialists Conference Aachen. Germany, 2004 \nfor both the PI (Ks = 0) and RRC controllers, where the \ninertia ratio a for the RRC controller is expressed in (7). \nFrom (9), it can he seen that the location of the closed- \nloop zeros cannot he assigned independently of the: closed- \nloop poles, and, consequently, the closed-loop regulation \nand tracking dynamics cannot he independently tuned. \nJ , s ' + K , s + ( K , + K , ( I + K , ) )  \n- (9) -_ 0\" -s \nI ,  J ,  J , s ~  + K,s3 + ( J p , ' ( I  +a) + K,)sz + KpW,'s + K,Wo' \nHere, an extended RRC control structure is introduced in \nFig. 3(a), which includes an additional feedback signal \nproportional to the disturbance torque Kpd and its derivative \nKd. Equation (IO) now gives the modified closed-loop \ntransfer function describing the regulation dynamics, from \nwhere it can he seen that the closed-loop poles and zeros can \nhe independently assigned. Assigning the closed-loop zeros \nto the imaginary axis (i.e. no damping of the complex \nconjugate zeros) for a user-defined frequency, or, , will \nreject a periodic load-side disturbance of the same \nfrequency. Equations (1 I )  and (12) gives the required \ndisturbance torque gains. \nPeriodic load-side disturbances are a common feature of \nindustrial automated production systems, for instance. where \nobjects are dropped at equal time intervals onto a conveyer \nbelt. For such systems, disturbance torque cannot he sensed \ndirectly and the extended control scheme shown in Fig. 3(a) \ntherefore requires an observer to provide a dynamic \nestimate. Assuming the disturbance torque is a state- \nvariable, and its derivative is zero, a state-variable \nrepresentation of the system can he obtained that includes \nthe disturbance torque as a state (12). \nThe measured output states can he used to reduce the \ncomplexity of the Observer. In this case both q. and td are \nsensed, thereby reducing the required order of the observer \nto two. It therefore takes the dynamic structure shown in Fig. \n3(b). Letting y =  [ql q2]' he an internal state vector of the \nobserver, and G = [g, g ~ l '  he the observer gain vector, (13) is \nobtained from Gopinath's reduced order theorem [!)I, where \nX I  and X, represent the measured and estimated state \nvariables, respectively. The transfer function describing the \nrelationship between the observed and actual load-torque \ncan he obtained from (12) and is given by (14) where the \ndenominator equation describes the observer pole locations. \nThe observer poles are therefore assigned according to the \ncoefficients of the 2\"d order ITAE polynomial given in (15), \nwhere 2&=1.414 and is the equivalent -3dB observer \nbandwidth. The observer gains GI and GI are given by (16) \nand (17) respectively. \n(a) RRC controller plus disturbance feedback \n(b) Reduced order observer \nfigure 3. Control stmctwes fora twc-inertia mechanical model of a servo \ndrive system \nIf the observer pole locations are assigned to he much \ngreater than the closed loop zeros in (IO),  it can he assumed \nthat the observer dynamics do not unduly influence the \nperformance of the closed-loop regulation dynamics. \nHowever, in practice the observer poles cannot he placed \nsignificantly higher since there exists a trade-off between the \nbandwidth of the observer and filtering of high frequency \nnoise generated by the sensing devices andlor the power \namplifier. Moreover, in the case of the proposed control \nscheme, where the derivative of the observed load torque is \nrequired, the attenuation of high frequency noise is of \ngreater importance if the control scheme is to he practically \nrealisable. \n4580 \n2004 35th Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference Aochen, Germany, 2004 \nConsider Fig. 4, which is identical to the control structure \nof Fig. 3(a) except the observer dynamics are included i n  the \ndisturbance feedback. Equation (18) now gives the modified \nclosed-loop transfer function describing the regulation \ndynamics, where it can be seen that the numerator now \ncontains two pairs of complex zeros that can be \nindependently assigned by the selection of the observer \ngains GI and Ga and the disturbance feedback gains Kpd and \nKa. Thus, by proper adjustment of these gains, the closed- \nloop system dynamics can be tuned to reject a specific user \ndefined frequency whilst eliminating the effects of the \nobserver dynamics on the rejection performance, i.e. a \nrelatively slow disturbance observer can be implemented, \nattenuating high frequency noise, without sacrificing the \ncontrol objective. \nFigure 4. RRC conlroller plus observer disturbance feedback \n(S*  + w , ~ ) ( s ~ + z & w * + w , ~ )  (19) \nEquation (19) shows a general expression describing two \npairs of complex zeros, where the first root represents the \nuser defined rejection frequency, (damping equals zero), \nand the other root defines the arbitrary location of the \nsecond pair of complex zeros. By comparing the numerator \nof (18) with (19). expressions can be derived that enable q \nand the observer pole locations to be independently assigned \nas follows: \nTABLE U. \nMECHANICAL PARAMETERS \n0.00145 kgm \nTime [ZOmsldiv] \n(a) PI controller with w = 0.88ub \nTime [ZOddiv] \n(b) RRC controller with rn = 0.88at \nFigure 5 .  Simulated lracking step responses for the lwo-inenia servo-drive \nsystem \nIV. SIMULATED PERFORMANCE COMPARISON \nTo verify the theoretical analysis, an experimental multi- \nmass test facility has been assembled as discussed in the next \nsection. The mechanical parameters of the test facility are \ngiven in Table 11. Using the presented control structures, \ndynamic simulation models of the experimental closed-loop \nsystem are now employed to show performance \ncomparisons. \nA. Tracking performance \nThe RRC controller gains K,, , K, and K, are tuned \noptimally according to Table I. Fig. 5 shows simulated \nresults from the system in response to a step change in \nreference velocity of 10 rads.  Fig. 5(a) shows the dynamics \nresulting from the PI control structure, whilst Fig. 5(b) \nshows the RRC-induced dynamics. It can be seen that since \n4581 \n2004 35th Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference Aachen, Germany, 2 w 4  \nR < 1 ( R  = O S ) ,  the PI controller imparts an underdamped \nresponse, particularly at the load side, whilst the RRC \ncontroller 'virtually' increases R resulting in optimal load- \nside tracking performance. \nto attenuate 4j, even using a relatively high bandwidth \nobserver. However, in general, the low frequency \ndisturbance rejection performance is improved with the \nimplementation of disturbance feedback. \nB. Regulation performance \nWith identical control gains as for the tracking \nperformance evaluation, the regulation performance is \nevaluated via the closed-loop systems ability to reject a \nsinusoidal load-side disturbance, By way of example, the \nload-side disturbance is a 4Nm, 62.8 r ads  (10Hz) sine wave. \n.I(h,, ................. :.__~:. . . . . .  ..J ........... ..! ........ : ...... :,.:_: ........................ > \n12 1c1' I<+ 1:; 1 :* 1 :>: \nFrequency [radlsl \n(a) Tuning assuming an ideal disturbance observer \n........................... i ....... .....I. . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n*:' .\" 1 ? \"  ..c, 1 $ j 93 1 :' \nFrequency [radls] \n(b) Tuning assuming a non-ideal disturbance observer \nRgure 6.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nThe proposed control techniques, simulation results,,and \nobservations are now validated on an experimental test- \nfacility as illustrated in Fig 9, comprising of 2x2.2kW \nbrushless permanent magnet (PM) servo-machines mounted \nin a back-to-back configuration to provide a servo-drive and \ndynamic load, described by the parameters given in Table I. \nAn integrated 20Nm, SAW-based torque transducer forms \nthe interconnecting shaft between the two servo-machines, \nFig 9(a), and is used to realize the RRC and disturbance \nrejection control structures. The control algorithms, sensor \ninputs and control outputs are realized via a DSP-based, d- \nSPACE system as illustrated schematically in Fig. 9(b). \nBmshless PM motor Blushless PM load machine \nSAW baed tohue transducer \n(a) Mechanical system overview \nyAdditiOn. tarti. 7 \n40% inrraantd \nEnmdrrs \n(b) Functions of components \nFigure 9.

Tracking performance \nThe experimental tracking results presented in Fig. 10 are \nin response to a I O  r ads  step reference demand, this \ntherefore depicts the same events used in the simulation \nresults of Fig. 5. Consequently, the extra flexibility afforded \nby RRC is shown to be sufficient to simultaneously impart \noptimal closed-loop load-side performance whilst also \nallowing the independent or virtual selection of inertia ratio. \nB. Regulation performance \nTo evaluate the regulation performance, the load-side \nservo-machine generated a 4Nm sinusoidal disturbance \n~ \n4583 \nAachen, Germany, 2 W  \ntorque with a frequency of 62.8 r ads  (IOHz). It was found \nthat when disturbance feedback was implemented, a \ndisturbance observer with a bandwidth ab > 50Hz (54, in \nthis case) caused controller instability due to the noise \ninjected into the closed-loop system. Consequently, to \nprovide valid experimental results, the observer bandwidth \nwas limited to ab< 34,. \nTime [ZOddiv]  \n(a) PI wntmller with uh = 0.88% \n. . .  : . .  \nI . . :  \ni :  \n~> \n. .  \n. . !  , .......... ! .............. ..... ................... j \n: ; 1  \nMotor . i . 5 ; \nTime [ZOmJdiv] \n(b) RRC ~ontmller with U?, = 0.88% \nFigure IO. Measured tracking step responses for the experimental two- \ninertia servo-drive system \nFigure I I illustrates the regulation response when no \ndisturbance feedhack is implemented within the controller \nstructure showing both the load-speed and the shaft-torque. \nFig. 12(a) illustrates the responses with disturbance feedback \nwhen the feedback gains are chosen assuming an ideal \ndisturbance observer, case (i) and Fig. 12(b) assuming a \nnon-ideal disturbance observer, case (ii), where for each \ncase, a l a  = 34, . These results therefore depict the same \nevents used in the simulation results of Figs. 7, 8(a) and \n8(b). \nTo illustrate the effects of a further reduction in observer \nspeed, the experimental results in Fig. 12(a) and 12(b) are \nrepeated for 6& = 1.54, , i.e. the observer bandwidth is \nhalved, the results being presented in Figs. 13(a) and 13(b). \nIt can be seen by comparison of Figs. I2(a) and 13(a) that \nreducing the speed of the observer for case (i) significantly \ndeteriorates the control objective i.e. the attenuation of the \nload-torque perturbations is further reduced and comparable \nwith the results obtained with no disturbance feedback (Fig. \nII) ,  whilst comparing Figs. 12(b) and 13(b) for case (ii), i t  \ncan be seen that the load perturbations are now rejected from \n \n2004 35th Annul IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference Aachen.

CONCLUSIONS \nA comparative study of compensation schemes for the \ncontrol of multi-inertia mechanical systems has been \nreported. An improved technique based on the measurement \nof shaft torque using a SAW-based torque sensor is \ndemonstrated to improve dynamic tracking performance, \nwhilst additionally rejecting periodic load side disturbances. \nThe proposed scheme allows assignment of the closed-loop \nzeros, thus enabling the rejection of a specific periodic load \ndisturbance, and independent tuning of tracking and \nregulation dynamics. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThe authors acknowledge the UK Engineering and \nPhysical Science Research Council (EPSRC), and Sensor \nTechnology Ltd., Banbury, UK, for the provision of an \nEPSRC CASE studentship. \nREFERENCES \n[ I ]  A. hnrdale,  \u201cDynamic rotary torque measurement using surface \nacoustic waves.\u201dSennon.
