Consequently, as the optimal signaling level also\ndepends on both the state and the signaling effort of other\nmales in the population, such a situation becomes an evo-\nlutionary game. The solution to this game can be viewed\nas the population\u2019s signaling dynamics over the breeding\nseason.\nAmong the various forms of sexual signals, those based\non carotenoid pigments have attracted considerable in-\nterest (e.g., Olson and Owens 1998; Alonso-Alvarez et al.\n2004; Pe\u00b4rez-Rodr\u0131\u00b4guez 2008). As animals must obtain ca-\nrotenoids through their diet, and thus their availability\nmay be limiting, allocation of carotenoids to sexual sig-\nnaling may indicate a male\u2019s foraging ability and general\nquality. In particular, carotenoids have been shown to have\nantioxidant and immunomodulatory functions, leading to\npossible trade-offs between sexual signaling and somatic\nmaintenance (Lozano 1994; von Schantz et al. 1999). In-\ndeed, by experimentally manipulating carotenoid avail-\nability, several studies have demonstrated that carotenoid-\ndependent sexual signals can convey information about\nthe male\u2019s ability to resist parasites, diseases, or oxidative\nstress (e.g., Blount et al. 2003a; McGraw and Ardia 2003;\nKolluru et al. 2006; Pike et al. 2007). Carotenoids can also\nbe used dynamically and strategically, depending on the\nsocial context (Candolin 2000b; Gautier et al. 2008).\nIt is well documented that the degree with which sexual\nsignals indicate some underlying quality or condition (sig-\nnal honesty) is variable (Johnstone 1995; Candolin 1999,\n2000a; Sadd et al. 2006) and that, theoretically, perfect\nhonesty is not necessarily expected; it is enough to keep\nthe signaling system in place if the signal is honest \u201con\naverage\u201d (Johnstone and Grafen 1993; Kokko 1997).

For survival and mating success,\nsee eqq. (3), (7).\never, the question of what maintains the variability in sig-\nnaling strategies, both between and within individuals, has\nbeen a rather neglected topic in the sexual-selection lit-\nerature (Wong and Svensson 2009). To gain a thorough\nunderstanding of sexual signaling, it must be considered\nin a life-history context (Ho\u00a8glund and Sheldon 1998;\nBadyaev and Qvarnstro\u00a8m 2002; Badyaev and Vleck 2007)\nand in the context of competition between individ-\nuals (Kokko 1997). Here, using a combination of game-\ntheoretical modeling and dynamic optimization (Houston\nand McNamara 1987; McCauley et al. 2000), we explore\nhow a male\u2019s nutritional state and the level of competition\nhe faces are expected to affect his signaling dynamics and,\nconsequently, those of the population. While previous\nmodels have used state-dependent modeling to study\nsexual-signaling dynamics, they have not addressed the\nquestion of signal honesty and its variation over time. We\ntest key model predictions of signal variability and honesty,\nusing the three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus,\nwhere female choice is affected by male signaling effort\nand where males may engage in several breeding bouts\nover the season (Wootton 1976). However, the model is\nof broad applicability to other species and life histories\nand therefore provides more general insights into temporal\nvariation in sexual-signaling dynamics at both the indi-\nvidual and the population level.\nMaterial and Methods\nModel Description\nWe constructed a discrete-time, state-dependent dynamic\noptimization model, in which a male\u2019s behavioral action\nat any given time depends on his condition, C, and the\ntime- and state-dependent behavioral strategy that he\nadopts. Note that \u201ccondition\u201d here can be interpreted as\nthe nutritional state of a male, to keep the model more\nreadily comparable with our experiments. Therefore, for\nthe comparisons between the model output and the ex-\nperimental data, males in better condition simply have\nmore nutritional resources, such as carotenoids, to deploy\nfor sexual signaling. Following Houston and McNamara\n(1999), we define a strategy as a state-dependent rule for\nchoosing actions at each time point t.\nThe model is initiated with a distribution of male con-\nditions, using a binomial probability density function as\nfollows. As in the usual binomial probability notation, the\nparameter W denotes the \u201cprobability of success,\u201d referring\nhere to the probability of having acquired a nutrient unit.\nTherefore, the initial mean condition in the population\ncan be varied by changing the parameter W, which is\nbounded to 0\u20131; the smaller the value, the poorer the\ninitial mean condition in the population. The expected\nproportion Ji of individuals in a given initial condition\nC, is then given by\nC !max i C \u0001imaxJ p f(Cp iFC ,W)p W (1\u0001W) , (1a)i max i!(C )!max\nwhere i is . This ensures that0, 1, 2, \u2026 , Cmax\nCmax\nJ p 1 (1b)\u0001 i\nip0\n(e.g., Milton and Arnold 1990). This distribution was ad-\njusted slightly in the model in such a way that at least 1%\nof individuals were found in each of the possible starting\nconditions and the corresponding fraction was evenly sub-\ntracted from the other Ji values, keeping the overall sum\nat unity.\nAt each time step, t, individuals in each possible state\nchose a behavioral action among four alternatives. The\nfirst of these did not involve sexual signaling and so rep-\nresented skipping a reproductive bout and foraging in-\nstead. The other actions involved a weak, medium, or\nstrong sexual signal (see table 1 for summary of the actions\nand their associated nutritional costs). In the case of for-\naging, the nutrition yield was made stochastic, so that the\nexpected mean nutrition yield, y, was a model parameter,\nwith the following outcomes and associated probabilities:\ny, with probability 0.4; or , with probabilityy\u0002 1 y\u0001 1\n0.25; and 0, with probability 0.1. Males incurred a nutri-\ntional cost H at each time step, which was positively cor-\nrelated with the degree of signaling effort (see table 1).\nNote that we do not make an explicit distinction here\nbetween the cost of signaling per se and the possible as-\nsociated cost of male-male competition, so one can also\nconsider H as a summary measure of both the cost of\nsignaling and that of male-male competition. The indi-\nviduals chose among the options available by maximizing\nthe expected lifetime reproductive output given their cur-\nrent state, , from time t onward, using the dynamicR(C , T)t\nprogramming equation:\n\u2032R(C , T)p max [M \u0002 s R(x , t\u0002 1, T)], (2)t i i i\nResource Allocation and Sexual Signals 517\nwhere Ct is condition at time t; Mi and si are the current\nmating success and survival, respectively; and \u2032R(x , t\u0002i\nis the remaining reproductive output from time1, T)\nto T, assuming that the best condition-dependentt\u0002 1\naction is always chosen. \u201cCurrent\u201d here refers to the\u2032xi\nexpected mating success and survival until the next time\nstep as a result of the chosen level of sexual signaling and\nreproductive effort. To allow investigation of different sce-\nnarios of how survival might affect signaling dynamics and\nresource allocation, it was set to be exponentially depen-\ndent on condition, Ct:\ns p k [1\u0001 exp (k C )]. (3)i 1 2 t\nHere, k1 sets the asymptotic survival, and k2 indicates how\nfast this is achieved as a function of condition (the more\nnegative k2 is, the lower the condition needed for maxi-\nmum survival is).\nTo take into account the fact that animal decision mak-\ning is unlikely to be perfect and to aid convergence of the\nstrategies, we allowed error in decision making (McNa-\nmara et al. 1997). The probability of choosing a suboptimal\nbehavioral action was set to be dependent on the cost of\nthe error in terms of lost expected reproductive value,\n:lx(t)\n\u2032l p R(C , TFx )\u0001 R(C , TFx ), (4)x(t) t t t t\nwhere when an action not maximizing the repro-l 1 0x(t)\nductive value is chosen. To control the amount of errorR \u2032xt\nassociated with the costs of different choices, we write\n\u0001lx(t)\nb p exp , (5)x(t) ( )d\nwhere d is the error parameter (if , there are nodp 0\nerrors, and corresponds to \u223c0.5 probability of mak-dp 1\ning a wrong choice; see, e.g., Houston and McNamara\n1999; d is set to 0.9 in the results presented here). The b\nvalues, which are a measure of the potential loss of re-\nproductive value from choosing a given action, weight the\nprobability of that action being chosen at time t, ,Pr x(t)\nas follows:\nbx(t)Pr x(t)p , (6)Q\u0001 bx(t)xp1\nwhere Q is the number of possible actions (here, 4). The\nbest action to take at any given time t is defined by these\nprobabilities, instead of simply choosing the one with high-\nest .Rx(t)\nMating success of a given individual i in condition C\nat time t, MC,I,t, was based on the action-specific signal\nstrength (table 1), weighted by the probabilities of taking\na given action (eq. [6]), in relation to other males\u2019 signals\nat time t. First, the distribution of signal strengths in the\nmale population at each time step was calculated on the\nbasis of the condition-dependent actions, their associated\nprobabilities (eq. [6]), and the expected proportion of\nmales in a given condition at that time (eq. [8]), assuming\na large starting population. The males in the population\nwere then ranked according to their signal strength. The\nexpected number of matings was allowed to range between\n0 and 3, and their associated probabilities were calculated\nusing a binomial probability density function. Mating suc-\ncess probability is written as , where l denotes thelWM\nstrength of mating skew, that is, how fast WM changes with\nsignal rank (which ranges from 1 to the total number of\nmales). When , WM decreases with signal rank; largel 1 0\nvalues of l correspond to situations in which only males\nwith the strongest signals are successful in mating. The\nmale with the highest signal rank was always given three\nmatings ( ), and the probabilities for a male withi p 3max\nsignal rank j to acquire i (0, 1, 2, or 3) matings, qi, are\ni !maxl l l i \u0001imaxq p f(iFi ,W )p W (1\u0001W ) , (7a)i max M, j M, j M, ji!(i )!max\nand his expected total number of matings, Qj, becomes\nimax\nQ p q i. (7b)\u0001j i\nip0\nThe initial state distribution of the males (eq. [1a]) was\nleft to run until 99.9% of the male population was dead,\nso the end point of the model, T, was not fixed but de-\npended on the model parameters. A state distribution vec-\ntor from the initiation onward was calculated as (e.g.,s(t)\nCaswell 2001)\ns(t)p A(t)s(t), (8)\nwhere the transition probabilities in the matrix A were\nderived using the action-specific parameter values (table 1)\nand the probabilities of an individual at each state choosing\na given action, (eq. [6]). Death, , was anPr x(t) s(1, [0, T])\nabsorbing state.\nThe evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) was found by\nchanging the time- and state-dependent probabilities of\ntaking an action, , after each dynamic optimizationPr x(t)\nround to the new optimum and finding the population\nstate distribution for each t with equation (8). The dy-\nnamic optimization procedure was then repeated (back-\nward) until the new optimum values of were found.Pr x(t)\n518 The American Naturalist\nIn most cases, these probabilities converged in 10\u201320 it-\nerations in the backward optimization of equation (2).\nExperimental Design\nJuvenile three-spined sticklebacks were captured with dip\nnets from the River Endrick, Scotland (56\u00024\u0001N, 4\u000223\u0001W),\nduring November 2005. After capture, individual fish were\nallocated randomly to one of 12 holding aquariums, each\ncontaining only a water filter and several artificial plants\n(to provide refuges and reduce stress), and held until the\nstart of the breeding season under a simulated natural\ntemperature and photoperiod regime. Throughout the ex-\nperiment, fish were fed to satiation daily on a customized\ndiet based on anchovy-meal-based fish feed pellets (which\nare naturally low in carotenoids), supplemented with equal\nquantities of astaxanthin (Carophyll Pink; DSM, Basel,\nSwitzerland) and lutein (FloraGLO; Kemin Health, Des\nMoines, IA; which also contains approximately 4.2% zea-\nxanthin) at a total concentration of either 200 mg carot-\nenoids kg\u00011 pellets (high-carotenoid diet) or 10 mg kg\u00011\n(low-carotenoid diet). Full details of diet preparation are\ngiven elsewhere (Pike et al. 2007). This concentration and\ncomposition of carotenoids is known to allow male stick-\nlebacks to develop normal sexual coloration and success-\nfully engage in reproductive activities. However, while the\nlow-carotenoid diet is sufficient to produce sexual color-\nation, it does not permit them to maintain this level of\nsignal for as long as does the high-carotenoid diet (Pike\net al. 2007). Algal growth was suppressed using 2-chloro-\n4, 6-bis-(ethylamino)-s-triazine (Algae Destroyer; Aquar-\nium Pharmaceuticals, Chalfont, PA), and so we were con-\nfident that the only source of carotenoids available to these\nfish was through the diet.\nWhen males began to develop blue eye coloration (an\nindicator of sexual maturation), they were transferred to\nindividual experimental aquariums (33 cm # 18 cm # 19\ncm), where they were maintained on the same experimental\ndiets. The experimental aquariums contained only a filter\nand an artificial plant and had the same photoperiod, tem-\nperature, and water conditions as the holding aquariums.\nIndividual aquariums were separated by opaque partitions,\nso males were not in visual or olfactory contact with one\nanother. Each male was provided with a nesting dish and\nnesting material (following Pike et al. 2007) and shown a\ngravid female enclosed in a clear acrylic plastic container\nfor 5 min twice daily for 10 days, after which males had\ndeveloped red nuptial coloration and entered the courtship\nphase. This protocol allowed males to assess the adequacy\nof their signaling through the females\u2019 behavior without the\nproblems associated with dominance interactions between\nmales in artificially close proximity. Pilot experiments\nshowed that a dominance hierarchy would be otherwise\nquickly established, and the subdominant male would stop\nsignaling and normal courtship behavior, a situation that\nwould not occur in the wild as the territories can be farther\napart. We randomly selected 40 males for this experiment,\nwith equal numbers from each diet treatment.\nWhen nest building was complete, a gravid female was\nplaced temporarily in each male\u2019s tank and allowed to\nspawn. The males were then allowed to care for the eggs\nuntil the end of the incubation period, when the nests and\nnesting dishes were removed. After this first breeding at-\ntempt, males were induced to build another nest as before\nand were presented with a new female every 20 days, so\nthat the cycle of breeding continued (exactly as described\nabove) for a maximum of three breeding rounds. Every\n20 days, corresponding to the start of each new breeding\ncycle, we quantified each male\u2019s attractiveness to females\nand the strength of their sexual signal. Attractiveness was\nassessed by dividing males randomly into pairs so that\neach high-carotenoid-diet male was paired with an ap-\nproximately size-matched male of the opposite diet treat-\nment (in no breeding round did pairs of males differ sig-\nnificantly in standard length; paired t-tests, all ).P 1 .39\nThe same pairs were maintained throughout subsequent\nbreeding rounds, and so if a male failed to build a nest,\nthen no trial was conducted for that pair. The trials were\nconducted following a well-established technique (de-\nscribed in Pike et al. 2007), in which a single gravid female\nwas given a 5-min binary choice between the two males\nand her preference was quantified as the time spent with\nthe high-carotenoid male as a proportion of the time spent\nwith both males. A score of 0.5 therefore represents no\npreference for either male, while scores 10.5 indicate a\npreference for the high-carotenoid male. Immediately fol-\nlowing mate-choice trials, each male was shown a novel\ngravid female for 10 min, immediately netted, and pho-\ntographed using a standardized technique to determine a\n\u201credness\u201d score (measured as the proportion of color at-\ntributable to the red region of the spectrum; Pike et al.\n2007).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe proportion of males successfully building nests de-\ncreased over the season, so that sample sizes differ between\nbreeding rounds and the number of rounds completed\ndiffers between males. To account for this, seasonal\nchanges in redness scores were analyzed using linear\nmixed-effects models, with diet treatment (high or low\ncarotenoid) as a fixed factor and an individual fish\u2019s sig-\nnaling effort over the season as a repeated measure. Sub-\nsequent pairwise comparisons were made using paired t-\ntests. Female preference for the redder male was analyzed\nwith a generalized linear mixed-effects model, in which\nResource Allocation and Sexual Signals 519\nFigure 1: Predicted signaling dynamics through the breeding season with\ntwo different survival patterns.

These analyses were carried out in\nR 2.5.0 (R Development Core Team 2004).\nResults\nThe Model\nWe ran the model with a wide range of parameter values,\nalthough figure 1 illustrates its general dynamics under\ntwo different survival scenarios (fig. 1A), depicting the\nmales\u2019 signaling trajectories (fig. 1B) and signal honesty\n(fig. 1C) with two different initial conditions (100% and\n50% of maximum condition). The expected survival and\nits condition dependency play a strong role in determining\nthe expected signaling dynamics and the honesty of the\nsignal. If the maximum condition-dependent survival\nprobability is relatively high (fig. 1A, solid line), the stron-\ngest sexual signals at the start of the breeding season are\noften not produced by the individuals starting in the high-\nest condition (see also fig. 2), so that signal strength is not\na reliable indicator of condition at this time (i.e., it is\ndishonest). This is in contrast to a situation in which the\noverall survival probability is relatively low (fig. 1A, dotted\nline; fig. 3); saving resources does not pay back then, lead-\ning to males in good condition being more likely to signal\nthis from the start of the season. In other words, if longer-\nterm survival has the potential to contribute to the overall\nfitness return strongly enough, the males in the best con-\ndition out-survive rather than out-signal the weaker com-\npetitors, particularly in the beginning of the breeding sea-\nson. Figure 2 shows the signaling dynamics (fig. 2A, 2B,\n2E, 2F), mating success (cumulative matings; fig. 2C, 2G),\nand mortality (fig. 2D, 2H) for all the initial conditions\nover the breeding season. The panels on the left- and right-\nhand side depict the results for the situation in which\nsurvival is less strongly (fig. 2A\u20132D) or more strongly (fig.\n2E\u20132H) dependent on condition (fig. 1A), respectively.\nThe overall signal strength seen across the population is\npredicted to be somewhat higher (fig. 2A, 2B) when the\noverall survival probability is lower, and there is a clear\ncontrast in how honestly the signal strength reveals the\ntrue underlying condition depending on the survival pat-\ntern (as revealed by the relationship between initial con-\ndition and signal rank; fig. 2B, 2F). When the maximum\nsurvival probability is higher, males in poorer-than-average\ncondition start the breeding season with relatively high\nmating success (as a result of signaling strongly), but their\nearly death means that males in better initial condition\nhave a higher mating success over the season as a whole\nbecause of their greater number of breeding attempts (fig.\n2C, 2G). Typically, a large fraction of the male population\ndies soon after the initial breeding attempts, and individ-\nuals starting in the best condition survive longest (fig. 2D,\n2H).\nFigure 2: Results summary for all the individual starting conditions over time, using the same parameter values as figure 1. A\u2013D correspond to\nsurvival scenario 1, and E\u2013H show the outcome for survival scenario 2. A, E, Signal strength; B, F, signal rank.

Other parameters as\nin figures 1, 2.\nThe timing of peak honesty in the population (fig. 3A),\nas well as maximum life span (fig. 3B), is strongly depen-\ndent on the survival function. The parameter k2 here in-\ndicates how quickly survival increases toward the asymp-\ntotic survival (set by k1) as a function of condition (eq.\n[3]). Therefore, increasing values of k 2 indicate increasing\ncondition dependency in survival in our model (and cor-\nrespondingly, decreasing values indicate higher condition\nindependency of survival that could be due to predation,\nfor instance). The higher the condition-dependent maxi-\nmum survival (k1) is, the later in the breeding season the\nmaximum level of signal honesty occurs. This pattern is\nfurther modified by the strength of condition dependency\nin survival probability; for a given level of maximum sur-\nvival, peak signaling honesty is generally shown earlier\nwhen survival is more strongly condition dependent (fig.\n3A). Maximum life span in the population is achieved\nwhen the maximum survival is highest and survival is\nstrongly condition dependent (fig. 3B). This is also the\nsituation in which males in high condition are most likely\nto allocate less resources to signaling earlier in the season\nand enjoy the fitness returns of the increased number of\n(subsequent) mating opportunities instead.\nApart from the survival pattern, the maximum cost H\nassociated with the behavioral actions turned out to be the\none with most influence on the ESS outcome, together\nwith the initial mean condition of the male population\n(fig. 4). The strength of the maximum signal attained over\nthe whole breeding season decreases with increasing sig-\nnaling cost, whereas the initial mean condition of the males\naffects this pattern only if signaling is relatively costly (fig.\n4A). The initial mean condition of the males changes the\ntiming of maximum signaling observed in the population;\na higher mean condition leads to maximal signaling oc-\ncurring earlier in the season (fig. 4B), whereas the cost of\nsignaling has less impact on this pattern. Honesty of the\nsignal peaks earlier in the breeding season if signaling is\ncostly, and the initial mean condition of the males has\nvirtually no effect on this pattern (fig. 4C). The cost of\nsignaling has a clear effect on the predicted average life\nspan in the population, and this effect is particularly strong\nwhen the males are in relatively poor initial condition (fig.\n4D).\nTwo additional points are worth considering. At present,\nthe model implicitly assumes that female availability stays\nconstant over the whole breeding season. However, relax-\ning this assumption by simulating either increasing or de-\ncreasing mating opportunities with the progressing season\n(by letting the mating skew parameter l, eqq. [7], change\nwith the breeding season) had little effect on the outcome\nwith any parameter values. Similarly, reducing the relative\nvalue of offspring (by reducing their survival probability)\nborn late in the breeding season (e.g., because the food\navailability or growth period is reduced) did not affect the\npattern of signaling by males or its consequences in any\nsignificant way. There are two main reasons for these re-\nsults. First, particularly for males in relatively poor con-\ndition, the future is not a very important determinant for\nchoosing an optimum strategy in the beginning of the\nbreeding season as they are very unlikely to survive that\nlong (fig. 2D, 2H). Second, for males in better condition,\nthe importance of the overall survival pattern and the\nmaximum cost H associated with the behavioral strategies\nchosen overrules the more subtle implications of changes\nin offspring value or mating skew\u2014as the males compete\nfor their share of matings, the absolute benefit of this share\nis a less important factor in determining behavioral strat-\negies than surviving up until that time. However, out-\nsurviving competitors would obviously not pay off in ex-\ntreme cases in which the future promises very little in\nterms of further matings; this situation is analogous to\nlow survival, which promotes high investment and honesty\nin signaling in the beginning of the breeding season (fig.\n2).\nThe Experiment\nAllocation to sexual signaling, as defined by male redness,\ndecreased significantly over successive breeding rounds\n522 The American Naturalist\nFigure 4: Results summary as a function of two important control parameters, the maximum energy cost of signaling, H, and the initial mean\nstarting condition, W, of the males (eq.

Our main find-\nings were that the expected survival and its condition\ndependency are important determinants for the temporal\ndynamics of signal honesty. In brief, high overall survival,\nparticularly when condition dependent, can lead to signal\ndishonesty in the beginning of the breeding season as it\nis suboptimal for males in good condition to sacrifice their\nsurvival by signaling strongly enough to outcompete the\nmales in poorer condition. Such a situation does not occur\nwhen the expected survival is low overall since all males\nare predicted to signal according to their condition from\nResource Allocation and Sexual Signals 523\nFigure 5: A, Mean \u0003 SE change in redness over successive breeding\nrounds in males on high-carotenoid diets (filled data points, solid line)\nand low-carotenoid diets (open data points, dashed line; note that SE of\nthe last data point is too narrow to show behind the marker). The dotted\nline shows the overall mean redness in different breeding rounds. The\nnumber of high- and low-carotenoid-diet males breeding in each round\nwas 20 and 20 (round 1), 17 and 14 (round 2), and 8 and 7 (round 3),\nrespectively. B, Mean \u0003 SE female preference for the redder male in the\nthree breeding rounds (the proportion of time spent with the redder\nmale, where a score of 0.5 represents no preference).\nthe beginning of the breeding season. Thus, males in good\ncondition are predicted to either out-survive or out-signal\nthe poorer competitors, depending on their survival pros-\npects. The expected signaling pattern is further modified\nby the cost of signaling and by the initial frequency dis-\ntribution of male condition in the population. Generally,\nsignal honesty peaks later if the signaling cost is low, which\nis also the scenario in which individuals are predicted to\nsurvive the longest. The strongest effect of mean initial\ncondition of the males is on the timing of peak signaling;\nincreasing average condition brings the signaling com-\npetition forward in the season.\nIn general, patterns predicted by our optimization\nmodel when assuming a relatively high and condition-\ndependent survival rate matched the experimental results\nwell. Individuals from high- and low-carotenoid-diet treat-\nments initially signaled with approximately equal intensity.\nHowever, only the fish from the high-carotenoid treatment\nwere able to sustain a relatively high level of signaling over\nsuccessive breeding rounds. This suggests that the reli-\nability of the signal improves with time; males in good\nnutritional condition should restrict their signaling in the\nbeginning of their breeding career since they have a high\nchance of outliving males in poorer condition, but high\nearly investment in signaling would reduce their chance for\nfuture breeding opportunities (e.g., Candolin 2000a; Proulx\net al. 2002; Sparkes et al. 2008; see, however, Hunt et al.\n2004). A similar relationship is predicted by the model: the\ncorrelation between the signal rank of males and their real\nunderlying condition (i.e., the honesty of the signal) is ex-\npected to increase over successive breeding rounds.\nConcerning the likelihood of dishonest signaling in nat-\nural settings in general, we have shown here that the sur-\nvival probability and its condition dependency are im-\nportant factors in determining honesty. In the light of this\nresult, we would expect to see dishonesty in signaling most\ncommonly in mating systems in which the male survival\nlevel is reasonably high and condition dependent, in which\nmales can change their signaling level over time, and in\nwhich they can have more than one mating opportunity.\nThese conditions are likely to be met across a range of\nspecies, including sticklebacks (Candolin 1999, 2000a),\ncrickets Gryllus pennsylvanicus (Judge et al. 2008), and wolf\nspiders Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata (Mappes et al. 1996). In\ncontrast, situations in which mating is mostly limited to\na single opportunity per season should promote honesty\nin signaling (e.g., foot color in the blue-footed booby Sula\nnebouxii; Torres and Velando 2003). Similarly, in cases in\nwhich survival probability from one breeding attempt to\nthe next is low or the species is semelparous, we predict\nincreased honesty in signaling (see also Proulx et al. 2002).\nHowever, we are not aware of any comparative studies\ncontrasting signal honesty or condition dependency in\niteroparous versus semelparous species or populations.\nOur model suggests how such patterns can emerge from\nthe optimization of resource allocation to signaling in a\ncompetitive situation.\nIt has been the prevailing view in the sexual-selection\nliterature that female preferences for male traits remain\nconstant. However, it is now recognized that benefits from\nmate choice can depend on the genetic match between\nmales and females or the ecological and social context (e.g.,\nQvarnstro\u00a8m 2001; Welch 2003; Suk and Choe 2008). Re-\ncently, Chaine and Lyon (2008) showed that individual\nfemale lark buntings (Calamospiza melanocorys) change\ntheir preferences for particular male traits between years.\nAlso, if a signal is less honest in the beginning of the\nbreeding season, as predicted by our model, when survival\nis relatively high and condition dependent, it is logical to\npredict that female preferences based on that signal might\nalso be reduced. Our experimental results lend some sup-\nport for this prediction (fig. 5B): females showed a stronger\npreference for redder males toward the end of the breeding\n524 The American Naturalist\nseason. This opens up an avenue for future research as it\nwould be interesting to know whether this preference is\nbased on increased female choosiness or on increasing\ndifferences in signal expression between males. In general,\nwhether females become choosier toward the end of the\nbreeding season is also expected to depend on the potentially\nchanging costs and benefits associated with mate choice.\nFor instance, increasing predation pressure might select\nagainst increased choosiness over the breeding season.\nIt is interesting to note that the overall mean signaling\nlevel over the experimental groups remained relatively sim-\nilar throughout the breeding rounds; this is exactly what\nthe model predicts too. The relatively stable mean signaling\neffort over the breeding season therefore masks much of\nthe underlying signaling dynamics; the overall signal\nstrength remains seemingly unchanged, but it is different\nindividuals with different strategies and initial conditions\nthat are signaling the most at any given time. As the males\nreceived their respective diet treatments throughout the\nexperiment, it is possible that the increase in signal redness\nover time in high-carotenoid-diet males may have been\ndirectly influenced by an increasing availability of carot-\nenoids in the body, whereas the decrease in signal redness\nover time in low-carotenoid-diet males could have been\ndirectly affected by carotenoid levels depleting in body\ntissues in general. However, signal redness is not simply\na passive reflection of body carotenoid levels in this species.\nWe have previously shown that concentrations of carot-\nenoids in nuptial coloration far outweigh concentrations\nin the rest of the body, and moreover, low-carotenoid-diet\nmales invest a much greater proportion of their total pool\nof carotenoids into ornaments (81%) than do high-\ncarotenoid-diet males (21%; Pike et al. 2007). This strongly\nsuggests that allocations of carotenoids to signals are under\nactive control (and see Blount et al. 2003b).\nThe overall signaling dynamics at the population level\nare expected to depend on the condition distribution of\nthe males at the beginning of the breeding season. As the\ninitial condition of a male also affects his final fitness\nprospects, this might indicate strong selection for foraging\nability or growth in the period leading up to the breeding\nseason. Peuhkuri et al. (1995) showed experimentally in\nthe three-spined stickleback that individuals in a group\nhad a higher growth rate than did individuals reared on\ntheir own. They suggested that social facilitation in for-\naging and more effective predator avoidance might explain\nthe result. In light of our findings, one might speculate\nthat group living actually created the perception of a com-\npetitive environment in which it is important to grow fast\nand become relatively large. In the wild, selection for fast\ngrowth rates may also be balanced by selection in the op-\nposite direction because fast growth is associated with re-\nduced parasite resistance (Barber et al. 2001; Barber 2005).\nOur model demonstrates how optimization of individual\nresource allocation in a competitive, game-theoretical set-\nting can successfully predict the patterns in sexual signaling\nobserved in an experiment with three-spined sticklebacks.\nHowever, we suggest that our approach is much more widely\napplicable to a broad range of species with sexual signaling,\nand so understanding how individuals optimize their al-\nlocation of resources to signaling in a competitive situation\nremains a major challenge for the future.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Stirling University\u2019s Institute of Aquaculture for\nproviding the antioxidant-free food in this study, G.
