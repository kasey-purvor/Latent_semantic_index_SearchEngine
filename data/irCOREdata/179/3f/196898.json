This version was first published at  http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/62\/2\/735 , Doi: 10.1093\/jxb\/erq309.Grain development and its evolution in grasses remains poorly understood, despite cereals being our most important source of food. The grain, for which many grass species have been domesticated, is a single-seeded fruit with prominent and persistent endosperm. Brachypodium distachyon, a small wild grass, is being posited as a new model system for the temperate small grain cereals, but little is known about its endosperm development and how this compares with that of the domesticated cereals. A cellular and molecular map of domains within the developing Brachypodium endosperm is constructed. This provides the first detailed description of grain development in Brachypodium for the reference strain, Bd21, that will be useful for future genetic and comparative studies.\\ud\nDevelopment of Brachypodium grains is compared with that of wheat.

The grain, for which many grass species have been domesticated, is a single-seeded fruit\nwith prominent and persistent endosperm. Brachypodium distachyon, a small wild grass, is being posited as a new\nmodel system for the temperate small grain cereals, but little is known about its endosperm development and how\nthis compares with that of the domesticated cereals. A cellular and molecular map of domains within the developing\nBrachypodium endosperm is constructed. This provides the first detailed description of grain development in\nBrachypodium for the reference strain, Bd21, that will be useful for future genetic and comparative studies.\nDevelopment of Brachypodium grains is compared with that of wheat. Notably, the aleurone is not regionally\ndifferentiated as in wheat, suggesting that the modified aleurone region may be a feature of only a subset of cereals.\nAlso, the central endosperm and the nucellar epidermis contain unusually prominent cell walls that may act as\na storage material. The composition of these cell walls is more closely related to those of barley and oats than to\nthose of wheat. Therefore, although endosperm development is broadly similar to that of temperate small grain\ncereals, there are significant differences that may reflect its phylogenetic position between the Triticeae and rice.\nKey words: Brachypodium distachyon, development, endosperm, evolution, gene expression, grain structure.\nIntroduction\nHumans are largely dependent on domesticated cereals for\nthe bulk of their calorie intake (http:\/\/faostat.fao.org). The\nuse of grain as a source of food pre-dates cereal domestica-\ntion by several tens of thousands of years, with wild grasses\nalready providing a source of starch in the middle Stone Age\n(Mercader, 2009). Domestication has since improved the\nyield and productivity of grasses, significantly altering their\nphysiology, development, and morphology in the process\n(Shewry, 2009). Rice and wheat occupy the top position in\nterms of human calorie intake from cereals but, while the\ngenetic tractability of rice has revealed much about the\nmolecular basis of the domestication process in tropical\ncereals, wheat is less accessible as an experimental system\nfor the temperate cereals that lie within the Pooideae.\nBrachypodium distachyon is the first member of the\nPooideae subfamily to have its genome sequenced (Vogel\net al., 2010) and so provides a valuable resource for studies\non the more economically significant members of this\nfamily, such as wheat and barley (see, for example, Griffiths\net al., 2006). Genome analyses efforts in the domesticated\ncereals, in terms of completed genome sequencing, have\nfocused on rice, maize, and sorghum; but these are members\nof the Ehrhardtoideae and Panicoideae, respectively, so the\nBrachypodium genome and accompanying resources being\ndeveloped should provide a more relevant model for\ntemperate cereals (IRGSP, 2005; Paterson et al., 2009;\nSchnable et al., 2009; Vogel et al., 2010). Wheat and barley\ngenome sequencing are underway, the latter due for\n\u00aa 2010 The Author(s).\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-\nnc\/2.5), which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n at Leicester University Library on February 24, 2011\njxb.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \ncompletion in 2012 (Gill et al., 2004; Schulte et al., 2009). In\naddition, it should also provide insights into the effects of\ncultivation and domestication as this is the first wild grass\nto be sequenced.\nThe grain is a composite organ, composed of three\ngenetically distinct tissues that include the two genetically\ndistinct products of the fertilized female gametophyte and\nsurrounding maternal tissues. The maternal tissues include\nthe nucellus that surrounds the embryo sac and is itself\nsurrounded by two protective layers\u2014the inner and outer\ninteguments. Outside the integuments is the carpel wall,\nwhich develops into the pericarp after fertilization. The\nproducts of the double fertilization event, the diploid\nembryo and the triploid endosperm, generally form the\ngreater part of the mature grain and are protected by\nthe maternal cell layers, the pericarp and, in most grasses,\nthe floral organs, which become toughened as the grain\nripens and can remain adherent during grain dispersal.\nIn cultivated cereals and most grasses, the endosperm is\nthe largest compartment in the grain. Endosperm develop-\nment progresses in the post-fertilization phase via the\ndivision of the central cell-derived triploid nucleus, whose\ndescendents form a syncitial ring of nuclei around the\ncentral vacuole that divide and cellularize in a concerted\nsequence of anticlinal and periclinal cell divisions to\neventually fill the central vacuole (Becraft, 2001; Olsen,\n2001). The endosperm subsequently differentiates into\nfunctionally distinct subdomains, key among which are the\naleurone and the central starchy endosperm, although the\ntiming, identity, and relative sizes can vary depending on\nthe species.\nMost of the detailed developmental characterization of\ngrain development has been carried out on domesticated\nspecies. For example, grain development in wheat and\nbarley, particularly endosperm development, has been\nreasonably well studied (Olsen et al., 1992; Doan et al.,\n1996; Drea et al., 2005b; Wegel et al., 2005) and the\ndevelopmental programmes are very similar, with key\nmarker genes showing nearly identical expression patterns\n(Doan et al., 1996; Linnestad et al., 1998; Drea et al.,\n2005b). Other well-studied grains such as maize kernels and\nrice grains develop quite differently, with distinct tissue\ntypes, organization, and gene expression patterns (Brown\net al., 1996; Opsahl-Ferstad et al., 1997; Gutierrez-Marcos\net al., 2004; Sabelli and Larkins, 2009). However, since\nendosperm development in cereals is a distinctive process,\na comparative view extending to all studied models both\ntemperate and tropical is valuable. Specifically, the tracta-\nbility of maize genetics has revealed that the cereal\nendosperm aleurone layers rely on input signals from the\nzygote, surrounding maternal tissues, and on positional\ninformation for proper differentiation (Costa et al., 2003;\nGruis et al., 2006).\nFor this study, the events that occur during grain\ndevelopment in a wild grass, Brachypodium, at the cellular\nand molecular level were compared with those in wheat, one\nof the most closely related cultivated cereals whose de-\nvelopment has been well characterized. While grain de-\nvelopment is broadly similar, there are a number of\nsignificant differences in cellular differentiation and gene\nexpression patterns that reflect significant developmental\ndifferences between Brachypodium and wheat.\nMaterials and methods\nPlant growth conditions\nThe Bd-21 accession of Brachypodium distachyon and the Savanna\ncultivar of hexaploid wheat were used for a comparative analysis\nof grain development. Brachypodium plants were grown in\na controlled-environment room under the following conditions:\n22 h of light, 22 \u0001C temperature, and 60% relative humidity.\nWheat plants were grown as previously described (Drea et al.,\n2005b).\nGrain development was monitored using a dissecting microscope\nand photographed for macro-morphological analyses. For com-\nparison of tissue organization, fully developed green grains of\nBrachypodium and bread wheat were cut transversely at the mid\npoint with a razor blade and observed under brightfield or UV\nfluorescence microscopy.\nTissue preparation for histology and RNA in situ hybridization (ISH)\nFor 4#,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, caryopsis de-\nvelopment was staged from the time of anthesis and individual\nflorets were collected at 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, and 20 days after\nanthesis (DAA). For RNA ISH experiments, caryopses were\nstaged according to length. Caryopses were trimmed and fixed in\nformalin\u2013acetic acid\u2013alcohol (FAA; 3.7% formaldehyde, 5% acetic\nacid, 50% ethanol) and vacuum infiltrated for 15 min. After\novernight fixation, samples were transferred to the Tissue Tek\nvacuum infiltration processor supplied by Bayer (Newbury, UK)\nfor an automated dehydration\/infiltration process as follows:\n70% ethanol for 1 h at 35 \u0001C; 80% ethanol for 1.5 h at 35 \u0001C; 90%\nethanol for 2 h at 35 \u0001C; 100% ethanol for 1 h at 35 \u0001C; 100%\nethanol for 1.5 h at 35\u0001C; 100% ethanol for 2 h at 35 \u0001C;\n100% xylene for 0.5 h at 35 \u0001C; 100% xylene for 1.0 h at 35 \u0001C;\n100% xylene for 1.5 h at 35 \u0001C; and molten paraffin wax (supplied\nby VWR International, Poole, UK) for 2 h at 60 \u0001C. Samples were\nthen transferred to the Tissue Tek embedding console (Bayer) for\nembedding in paraffin blocks.\nSection preparation for ISH\nWax sections of 14 lm thickness were cut on a Leica Microtome\n(RM2125RT; Wetzlar, Germany) and organized sequentially on\npoly-lysine-coated slides (Grace Biolabs, supplied by Stratech\nScientific, Soham, UK). After drying down at 42 \u0001C overnight, the\nslides were checked by visual inspection using a dissecting micro-\nscope. Slides were de-waxed as previously described (Drea et al.,\n2005a) and used for staining or for RNA ISH.\nTissue staining\nDe-waxed sections of Brachypodium staged grains were stained\nwith DAPI solution (Partec) for 20 min and viewed with a fluores-\ncence microscope. Stained nuclei and some cell wall components\nproduced a blue fluorescence with UV excitation (various cell wall\ncomponents also fluoresce). Calcofluor (0.2%; a fluorescent bright-\nener) was used to detect cell walls in staged grains.\nEvans Blue vital staining\nStaining was performed as described previously (Young and\nGallie, 1999) with minor modifications. Briefly, thin sections were\nmade by hand of mature grains that had been imbibed in distilled\nwater overnight. Sections were immersed in a 0.1% Evans Blue\n736 | Opanowicz et al.\n at Leicester University Library on February 24, 2011\njxb.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nsolution for 4 min and then washed in several changes of distilled\nwater for 3 h with agitation. Sections were immediately mounted\nin distilled water and photographed using dissecting and com-\npound microscopes.\nBlast analysis and sequence comparison\nWheat cDNA sequences were used in BLASTN searches against\nthe Brachypodium genome 83 release (www.modelcrop.org) to\nidentify potential markers with high nucleotide sequence similarity\nand single copy status. These results were used to design primers\nfor RT-PCR and ISH (see Supplementary Table S1 available at\nJXB online).\nRNA isolation and RT-PCR\nSamples for three biological replicates were collected at each of the\nfollowing stages: 3, 5, 8, 10, 15, and 20 DAA. Alternatively, grains\nwere collected based on size. The husks were removed from each\ncaryopsis before freezing in liquid nitrogen and storing at \u201370 \u0001C.\nCellular RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit\n(Qiagen). A 1 lg aliquot of total RNA was reverse-transcribed\nwith an Omniscript RT Kit (Qiagen) using an oligo(dT) primer\n(Invitrogen). The final concentration of RNA and the cDNA\ncontent were assessed using a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectropho-\ntometer. PCR was performed for gene expression analyses using\n0.5 lg of cDNA from each staged grain. Primers against selected\nBrachypodium genes (Table 1) were designed based on the\nBrachypodium draft genome (www.Brachypodium.org). For cDNA\nsynthesis the poly(T) primer used was 5#GACTCGAGTCGA-\nCATCGA(T)17. Control primers were BdH4f and BdH4r: 5#ATG-\nGATCCTCCAATCCAGAC3# and TATTGTGTTGGACTCTG-\nGTG3\u2019; BdGAPDHf and BdGAPDHr (see Supplementary Table\nS1 at JXB online). The PCR products were loaded onto a 1%\nagarose gel containing ethidium bromide, and electrophoresis was\nperformed. The gel was examined and photographed using a UV\nimager.\nIn situ hybridization\nHybridizations were carried out as previously described (Drea\net al., 2005a) with minor modifications. Gene-specific regions were\namplified by PCR from genomic DNA or cDNA and were either\nused directly to generate digoxigenin-labelled RNA probes (by\nusing T7 RNA polymerase sites incorporated into the reverse\nprimer) or first cloned into the pCR4 TOPO vector (Invitrogen)\nwhich has a T7 RNAP site flanking the inserted sequence.\nMicroscopy and image processing\nFor anatomical analyses and starch composition, 20 DAA grains\nfrom Brachypodium and 30 DAA grains from bread wheat were\ncut transversely across the widest part of the grain and sputter\ncoated with gold. Samples were then analysed at 3 kV accelerating\nvoltage in a Philips XL 30 FEG scanning electron microscope.\nRepresentative sections of Brachypodium grains were photo-\ngraphed with a Nikon E800 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) using\na digital camera under bright-field conditions and a UV filter.\nMagnifications and camera settings remained unchanged for all\nimages through all stages for Brachypodium sections.\nFourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) imaging\nTransverse cell-wall-only thin cross-sections were prepared accord-\ning the method described previously (Toole et al., 2007) with the\nsections being cut (1 lm thick) using an ultramicrotome rather\nthan (50 lm thick) using a vibratome. FT-IR spectral images were\nthen collected and each pixel within each image was classified\nand colour coded using the image analysis software ENVI 4.7\n(Research Systems Inc., Boulder, CO, USA), according to a\nclassification method that was developed to analyse barley and\noat endosperm cell walls (G.A. Toole et al., unpublished results).\nResults\nSpike and floret structure in Brachypodium distachyon\nGrass inflorescences are typically composed of several\nspikelets each containing one or more florets, the latter\ncomposed of the carpel, stamens, lodicules, palea, and\nlemma. Brachypodium has a simple spike-like racemose\ninflorescence and spikelets that often have awned lemmas.\nThe inflorescence matures basipetally as the spikelets\nemerge, but within each spikelet grain maturation is\nacropetal (Khan and Stace, 1999). In Brachypodium, the\nterminal and lateral spikelets are indeterminate, with several\ndiminished and underdeveloped florets at the apex. Spike-\nlets are highly variable for the number of fertile florets that\ndevelop (4\u201320) and freely disarticulate below each floret at\nmaturity. Each floret is subtended by two glumes. The spike\nof wheat resembles the spikelet of Brachypodium (Supple-\nmentary Fig. S1A at JXB online). The spikelet of wheat is\na regular arrangement of five florets eventually producing\nup to four grains (the most distal floret remaining unfertil-\nized) and subtended by two glumes. The florets of Bd21\nobserved here contained a single carpel and ovule, as in all\ngrasses, but just two anthers. Generally grass florets,\nincluding those of all other members of the Brachypodium\ngenus, contain three anthers (Hubbard, 1954). The anthers\nof B. distachyon are shorter than in perennial Brachypodium\nspecies and the flowers are cleistogamous (Khan and Stace,\n1999).\nBrachypodium is widely considered to be a model for\ntemperate cereals (Draper et al., 2001; Opanowicz et al.,\n2008; Vogel et al., 2010) and its genome has recently been\nsequenced (Vogel et al., 2010), yet little is known about how\ngrain structure and development compare with those\ncereals. As a first step, the overall shape and size of its\ngrains was compared with that of related grasses and cereals\n(Fig.1). Brachypodium distachyon forms a caryopsis with an\nTable 1.

The Brachypodium grain is comparable in length with\nthat of wheat, but contrasts starkly in terms of width and\ndepth (Fig. 1A, and Supplementary Fig. S1B at JXB\nonline). A comparison of grain dimensions in different grass\nspecies shows that the Brachypodium grain profile is narrow\nand flat with a width:depth ratio of 1.7 (Supplementary\nFig. S1B), typical of grains of the closely related wild\nElymus and Bromus genera with ratios of 1.43 and 1.76,\nrespectively, and some wild wheats (data not shown). In\ncontrast, typical hexaploid Triticum aestivum cultivars\nSoissons and Cadenza have more rounded profiles with an\naverage width:depth ratio of 1.15.\nComparative cytological analysis of endosperm reveals\nsignificant differences in grain architecture between\nBrachypodium and wheat\nTo determine the cellular basis for these differences in grain\nprofile, a cytological analysis of mature Brachypodium and\nwheat grains was performed, focusing on the endosperm\nwhich forms the major part of the grain in both species. In\nwheat, four major cell types constitute the endosperm,\nincluding transfer cells (modified aleurone), aleurone cells,\nstarchy endosperm cells, and embryo-surrounding region\ncells.\nIn transverse section, the Brachypodium grain does not\npossess a distinctly indented hilum or \u2018crease\u2019 as is charac-\nteristic in wheat, but rather has a shallow concave in-\ndentation underlying the main vascular trace (Fig. 1A). The\nsize of the nucellar projection region that extends from\nthe vasculature towards the endosperm is vastly reduced\nin Brachypodium as compared with wheat, most notably\nlater in development (Fig. 1F inset). Reflecting the flat\nshape of the caryopsis, the Brachypodium endosperm\nforms a crescent-shaped structure unlike the lobed structure\nthat encloses the crease and nucellar projection in the\nrounder wheat grains. The region of the endosperm that\ncorresponds to the modified aleurone in wheat forms a\nconvex indentation in Brachypodium facing the nucellar\nprojection region. Finally, the endosperm cavity is absent in\nBrachypodium (Fig. 1A).\nTo gain further insight into Brachypodium grain de-\nvelopment, grains were staged using anthesis (0 DAA) as\nthe reference point and their growth followed up to ;15\nDAA (Fig. 1C\u2013F). The fertilized caryopsis (0 DAA)\nis ;1 mm long and elongates rapidly between 2 and 6\nDAA, and reaches its maximum length of 7\u20138 mm by 6\nDAA (Fig. 1B). Using sectioned material to examine\nnuclear proliferation and lateral growth, four key stages of\ngrain development were established (illustrated schemati-\ncally in Fig. 6) corresponding to (i) syncytial endosperm\nand a circular central vacuole 0\u20133 DAA (Fig. 1C);\n(ii) an elongated, flat vacuole with a thin sliver of endo-\nsperm (at which time cellularization begins; 3\u20135 DAA)\n(Fig. 1D); (iii) cellularized endosperm with adaxial inden-\ntations (arrowed) flanking the nucellar projection 5\u201313\nDAA (Fig. 1E); and (iv) fully filled endosperm with smaller\nperipheral aleurone cells discernible at 13\u201318 DAA\n(Fig. 1F). The entire process, from anthesis through to fully\nfilled ripe grains, takes ;24 d as opposed to an average\nof 35 d in wheat (depending on cultivar and growing\nconditions).\nThe different developmental stages were compared with\ncorresponding stages in wheat grains (Fig. 1 and summarized\nin Fig. 6). Although the early post-fertilization stages are\nsimilar in both species, with endosperm nuclei proliferating\nand migrating around the periphery (Fig. 1C; Wegel et al.,\n2005), there are clear differences evident before cellulariza-\ntion. In wheat (Drea et al., 2005b) and barley (Olsen et al.,\n1992), nuclei form a highly regular arrangement around\nthe periphery of the central vacuole that is seen in wheat just\nprior to cellularization. Cell division then re-orientates\nanticlinally in wheat and barley to produce internal layers\nof nuclei, but Brachypodium\u2019s nuclear distribution appears\nmore random at this point in development (5 DAA; Fig. 1D\nwith wheat inset). The Brachypodium grain then becomes\nflattened dorso-ventrally and, by ;8 DAA, the smaller\n(presumptive) aleurone cells form around the periphery of\nthe endosperm and deep adaxial indentations become\napparent in the endosperm flanking the nucellar projection\n(Fig. 1E). The nucellar tissue adjacent to the adaxial\nendosperm becomes compressed. At ;15 DAA, small square\ncells around the edge of the central endosperm are clearly\nvisible and appear uniformly distributed abaxially, adaxially,\nand laterally (Fig. 1F and inset). The nucellar projection is\nmuch reduced as compared with wheat (Drea et al., 2005b;\nFig. 1F inset).\nTo map changes in cell cycle activity during grain\ndevelopment, a histone H4 transcript was used as a marker.\nHistone H4 is expressed in a DNA replication-dependent\nmanner and is, therefore, a good indicator of cell cycle\nactivity (Fobert et al., 1994) and can also provide an\nindication of cellularization and tissue differentiation (Drea\net al., 2005b). At 3\u20135 DAA, there are high levels of histone\nH4 transcript in the outer pericarp layer and in the two\ninteguments, inner and outer, as well as in the syncytial\nendosperm (Fig. 1G, H). In wheat grains at this stage, the\nhistone transcript preferentially accumulates in the adaxial\nnucellar projection, whereas in Brachypodium the histone\ntranscript is mainly present in syncytial endosperm (Drea\net al., 2005b; Fig. 1H). The inner integument layer, marked\nnaturally by the deposition of mucilage and a resulting\nbrown colouration, is visible early in Brachypodium at a\nmuch earlier stage than in wheat grains. By 4 DAA, histone\ntranscript is further restricted to the outer integument\n(Fig. 1G inset). The endosperm of Brachypodium at ;5\nDAA (Fig. 1H) is restricted to a slim sliver of material\nbetween robust nucellar layers in a flat grain. Histone signal\nis evenly distributed throughout the endosperm, indicating\nthat the endosperm is not yet cellularized (Fig. 1H). After\nthe endosperm has clearly cellularized (8 DAA), histone\ntranscript is strongest along the periphery as in wheat, and\nis now distinctly patchy (Fig. 1I). This patchy expression\npattern is due to asynchronized cell cycle progression in\nBrachypodium endosperm development | 739\n at Leicester University Library on February 24, 2011\njxb.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nneighbouring cells combined with the tight S-phase specific-\nity of histone gene expression (Fobert et al., 1994). Unlike\nin wheat grains at an equivalent developmental stage,\nhowever, there is no specific exclusion of transcript from\nthe region presumed to equate to the modified aleurone\noverlying the crease (Fig. 1I). The disappearance of histone\nH4 transcript can indicate tissue differentiation (Drea et al.,\n2005b) and these differences in the timing between wheat\nand Brachypodium indicate that the aleurone region adja-\ncent to the crease develops quite differently in the two\nspecies. Subsequently, as grain filling is completed, histone\nexpression is preferentially localized to the abaxial endo-\nsperm as shown by a cross-section of a grain at ;10 DAA\n(Fig. 1J). Taken together, these data indicate that there\nare distinct differences in the timing of differentiation in\ndifferent regions of the Brachypodium grain and that these\ndiffer in a number of respects from wheat, particularly\nregarding the differentiation of the modified aleurone layer.\nMolecular mapping of maternal and filial expression\ndomains\nThe cytological analysis suggested that grain development\nwas similar in many ways to that of wheat or barley, but\nthat the timing and nature of cell type specification differed.\nTo gain further insight into these differences, the molecular\nevents associated with grain development were aligned using\nkey marker genes (Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online)\nto map temporally and spatially domains of expression in\nthe developing Brachypodium grain and relating these to the\ncytological events observed. Markers were selected based\non tissue-specific markers in wheat (Drea et al., 2005b) and\nBrachypodium storage proteins (Laudencia-Chingcuanco\nand Vensel, 2008). A BLASTN survey of wheat endosperm-\nand cell type-specific genes against the Brachypodium\ngenome revealed that there were generally lower levels of\nsequence similarity in the grouping expressed in the aleu-\nrone layers (Fig. 2A) as opposed to the groupings expressed\nin other tissues.\nTo select tissue-specific markers, Brachypodium genes\nwere chosen that are most similar to known tissue-specific\nmarkers in wheat [i.e. those with high sequence similarity\nat the nucleotide level but which were not members of\nextensive gene families so as to maintain specificity (listed\nin Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online)]. For example,\nC13 endopeptidase or nucellain marks the nucellar lysate\nand nucellar epidermis\u2014tissues that are degraded and\ncompressed relatively early in wheat grain development\n(Linnestad et al., 1998; Drea et al., 2005b); pyruvate\northophosphate dikinase (PPDK) marks the single aleurone\nlayer very specifically in wheat though its actual function is\nelusive given that it is involved in photosynthesis in green\ntissues converting phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate (Drea\net al., 2005b; Hong-Gyu et al., 2005; Chastain et al., 2006);\nan a-galactosidase specifically marks the modified aleurone\nwithin the grain in wheat (Drea et al., 2005b). BdGLO1 and\nBdGLO2 were chosen because they have been shown to be\nthe most abundant storage proteins in Brachypodium grain\n(Laudencia-Chingcuanco and Vensel, 2008) and provide\nuseful markers for storage protein deposition in the\nendosperm during grain filling.\nIn all cases, except BdGLO2 and histone H4, a BLASTN\nquery with the starting wheat nucleotide sequence resulted\nin a single highly significant (e <10\u00016) result at the nucle-\notide level for Brachypodium. More than one homologue\nfor histone H4 and BdGLO2 was expected on the basis\nof previous analyses (Drea et al., 2005b; Laudencia-\nChingcuanco and Vensel, 2008). The presence of only one\ncopy of the PPDK is interesting given that maize, rice, and\nsorghum all have two PPDK genes, with maize and rice\nproducing two proteins (chloroplast and cytosolic forms)\nfrom one of the genes (Imaizumi et al., 1997). The\nBrachypodium PPDK gene has a similar structure to the rice\nand maize gene, OsPPDKB and ppdkZm1, respectively,\nwhere a 5# exon located distantly upstream provides a\nputative targeting peptide for chloroplast localization\n(Imaizumi et al., 1997).\nAll genes selected show expression in grains as judged by\nan RT-PCR survey of different tissues (Supplementary Fig.\nS2 at JXB online). Both BdGLO genes are expressed\nexclusively in the grain, specifically in the latter stages of\ngrain development (10 DAA onwards) when the endosperm\nis fully cellularized. Some of the other selected genes are\nalso expressed in non-grain tissues, and expression was\ndetected in multiple tissues (Supplementary Fig. S2).\nMaternal tissue organization in Brachypodium grains\ndiffers from that of wheat throughout development\nThe order and identity of tissue layers in the mature\nBrachypodium grain resemble those of wheat, but one very\nstriking difference revealed by the cytological analysis is the\npersistence of the nucellar epidermis layer in Brachypodium.\nThis reaches 50\u201360 lm at the thickest point in the lateral\nadaxial region (and in longitudinal sections is very pro-\nnounced at the distal or stigma end of the grain) and\nthinnest at the central abaxial point, where it is comparable\nwith the thickness of the nucellar epidermis in wheat\n(Fig. 2B\u2013E; Table 1). In wheat grain, the nucellar epidermis\nlayer becomes compressed early in development and is very\nreduced even by 9 DAA. In Brachypodium, the inner and\nouter cell walls of the nucellar epidermis are thickened and\nminimally compressed on the sides of lobes. This suggests\nthat these wall thickenings have a skeletal function,\nreinforcing the cell walls, and enhancing their resistance to\ndeformation. In rice, the nucellar epidermis is also persis-\ntent, and these cells are specialized for transport of nutrients\n(Oparka and Gates, 1981; Ellis and Chaffey, 1987), being\nelongated in the principal direction of assimilate flow (i.e.\ncircumferentially around the endosperm) and symplastically\nconnected to adjacent cells by numerous plasmodesmata.\nElectron microscopy indicates that Brachypodium nucellar\nepidermal cells are also rich in plasmodesmata (data not\nshown).\nISH with BdC13 (endopeptidase\/nucellain) showed en-\nhanced expression in the nucellar lysate cell layers of young\n740 | Opanowicz et al.\n at Leicester University Library on February 24, 2011\njxb.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nBrachypodium grains from 4 DAA (Fig. 2D). This is\ncomparable with the expression pattern observed in wheat\n(Drea et al., 2005b). Expression was not detected in the\nnucellar epidermis except in later stages of development\nwhen transcript was present in the central abaxial region\nwhere the layer is at its narrowest point in the grain\n(Fig. 2E) and cells are thinnest (Table 1). The expression of\nthis endopeptidase could correlate with specific degradation\nof cellular components and compression of the layer in this\nregion.\nEndosperm differentiation in Brachypodium and wheat\nThe outermost cell layer, or aleurone, is a functionally and\nstructurally distinct but general feature of plant endosperm.\nThe aleurone layer surrounds the central endosperm, except\nin the transfer cell region in temperate small grain cereals,\nand is composed of one (wheat) or more (barley) layers. The\nBrachypodium aleurone layer tends to be more irregular,\nbeing from one to three or more cells deep. It was noted that\nthe Brachypodium aleurone layer appears to be structurally\nFig. 2.

In wheat, the aleurone tends to\nadhere to the maternal tissues during disruption (Fig. 3B),\na feature that is exploited during milling wheat grain and\nhas the effect of separating the a-amylase activity in the\naleurone from the starchy central endosperm.\nThe irregular nature and variable cell morphology of\nthe aleurone layer make it difficult to determine the tim-\ning of its differentiation from the central endosperm\nusing cytological examination. Therefore, to investigate the\ntiming of aleurone at the molecular level, the temporal and\nspatial expression of presumptive aleurone-specific marker\ngenes was examined. ISH using a BdPPDK probe suggests\nthat the aleurone differentiates later or is less distinct\nin Brachypodium. BdPPDK transcript accumulated in the\npericarp tissue at early stages (Fig. 3C) as was the case in\nwheat, but the expression in the peripheral endosperm\nwas both weaker and occurred later during development\nthan is the case in wheat (Fig. 3D\u2013F). In wheat, expression\nis strong and coincides with differentiation of the periph-\neral endosperm, whereas in Brachypodium accumulation is\nonly detected well after cellularization. In wheat the PPDK\ntranscript accumulates specificially in the peripheral aleu-\nrone and is absent from the modified aleurone but, in\nBrachypodium, the distinction was less obvious.\nThe modified aleurone domain is absent in\nBrachypodium\nTo investigate further the possible absence of localized\nspecialization within the aleurone layer, accumulation of an\na-galactosidase transcript that was specifically expressed\nin the modified aleurone in wheat (Drea et al., 2005b) was\nexamined. ISH with this probe did not produce any\nlocalized signal in the corresponding region in Brachypo-\ndium (data not shown), supporting the suggestion that the\naleurone is not regionally differentiated.\nTo confirm that modified aleurone is indeed absent, a vital\ndye, Evans Blue, was utilized to stain freshly cut sections of\ngrains. Dead cells absorb and stain strongly with the blue\ndye (Young and Gallie, 1999). In the mature wheat grain,\nthe only living tissues are the aleurone and embryo\n(Fig. 4A, C, E; Young and Gallie, 1999) so, while most of\nthe aleurone of wheat excludes the dye and remains clear,\nthe modified aleurone of the mature wheat grain stains\nstrongly (Fig. 4A) because it is composed of dead cells.\nHowever, in the mature Brachypodium grain, while the\naleurone layer and embryo exclude the dye as in wheat\n(Fig. 4B, D, F) so also does the region adjacent to the\nvascular bundle (Fig. 4B, G). This confirms that the\nBrachypodium endosperm is bounded by a continuous layer\nof living aleurone cells and does not possess a distinctive\nmodified aleurone region. The distinction of peripheral and\nmodified aleurone in other cereals such as wheat is made\nclear at the molecular level by the expression of genes in\nonly one aleurone layer, such as PPDK. Since the expres-\nsion pattern for this gene in Brachypodium grains did not\ndefinitively mark the aleurone as it does in wheat, another\naleurone marker, BdGLO1, an orthologue of which is\nexpressed in the aleurone of barley (Heck et al., 1993), was\nused. The BdGLO1 transcript is restricted to the aleurone\nlayers and the embryo of the mature Brachypodium grain\n(Fig. 4H). A continuous peripheral pattern of expression\nextending into the adaxial region above the vasculature\nwas detected from ;7\u20138 DAA (Fig. 4I), confirming that the\naleurone is not differentiated into discrete cell types as in\nwheat and barley. BdGLO1 transcript accumulation in the\nabaxial aleurone was found to extend into between one and\nfour cell layers in an irregular manner, contrasting with\na more discrete localization to a single cell layer in the\nadaxial layer (Fig. 4H).\nIn contrast to BdGLO1, BdGLO2 (a member of a family\nof genes related to the 12S globulins of oat) transcripts were\nlocalized to the central endosperm and excluded from the\nperipheral layers (Fig. 4J, L). In addition, BdGLO2 was not\ndetected in the embryo (data not shown), in contrast to the\nstrong expression of BdGLO1 (Fig. 4H). These detailed\nspatial and temporal expression patterns agree with the RT-\nPCR results indicating a slightly earlier onset of expression\nfor BdGLO2 and indicate that specification of aleurone cell\nidentity occurs after central endosperm proliferation has\nceased (Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online).\nBrachypodium central endosperm is composed of small\nthick-walled cells\nStarch forms the major storage product of all the major\ncultivated cereals, accounting for up to 75% of the wheat\ngrain (Bewley and Black, 1994).

While wheat endosperm cells were tightly packed\nwith variable sized starch grains (Tomlinson et al., 2003),\nthe equivalent cells in Brachypodium have few and small\ngranules as judged by scanning electron microscopy\n(Fig. 5A). However, cell walls in the central endosperm of\nBrachypodium are very striking, reaching 4 lm (Fig. 5A).\nMeasurements were taken from scanning elelctron micro-\ngraphs of mature Brachypodium and wheat grains to\nquantify the differences in cell size and cell wall thicknesses\n(Fig. 5A; Table 1). Wheat endosperm cells are significantly\nlarger than Brachypodium cells in both the aleurone and\ncentral endosperm, but the cell walls of Brachypodium\nendosperm cells are over twice as thick as wheat cells in\nthe central endosperm. During germination, the cell walls of\nthe central endosperm become attenuated to 2.3860.74 lm\nand depleted of calcofluor-stained material at 6 d post-\ngermination (Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online),\nsuggesting mobilization of cell wall components during\ngermination.\nAs a first step towards determining the composition of\nBrachypodium cell walls and comparing these with other\ngrains, FT-IR spectroscopy was carried out on the endo-\nsperm cell wall network and the spectra compared with\nthose of other small grain cereals. FT-IR spectroscopic\nimaging reveals the composition and spatial distribution\nof cell wall components in situ, by coupling imaging tech-\nniques with infrared spectroscopic analysis on transverse\nde-starched tissue sections (Toole et al., 2007). The resultant\nspectral images were colour-coded based on b-glucan con-\ntent (Fig. 5B, C). A peak at 1065 cm\u00011 is indicative of the\nb-glucan content (characteristically high in barley endo-\nsperm cell walls); in contrast, a shoulder at 1075 cm\u00011\nindicates arabinoxylan (AX; typical of wheat). Arbitrary\nlimits were set for each colour classification, with pixels\nwhere the spectra were more similar to that for AX (i.e. a\nshoulder at 1075 cm\u00011) being coloured blue (low b-glucan),\nthose where the spectra showed a peak at 1065 cm\u00011 rather\nthan a shoulder being coloured purple (medium b-glucan),\nand those with a b-glucan peak at 1065 cm\u00011, being higher\nthan the main carbohydrate peak at 1041 cm\u00011, being\ncoloured red (high b-glucan). The average spectra for each\nclassification colour are shown in Fig. 5C and provide an\nindication of the relative abundance of the cell wall\nFig. 4.

Thus the increased levels of blue and purple\npixels indicate that the outer aleurone and subaleurone\nregions of the endosperm were higher in AX and lower in\nb-glucan as compared with the central region of the grain\n(which have increased red pixels). Figure 5D also shows the\naverage spectra for similar thin sections of the endosperm\ncell walls of wheat (Toole et al., 2007), barley, and oats\n(G. A. Toole et al., unpublished results), and shows that\nBrachypodium endosperm cell walls were similar in general\nprofile to barley and oats but with a lower b-glucan content.\nThe additional shoulder at 980 cm\u00011 is most probably due\nto other insoluble cell wall hemicelluloses, and was found\nto be higher in Brachypodium than in the other cereals\n(Fig. 5D).\nDiscussion\nAlthough Brachypodium grain development is broadly similar\nto that of wheat and the other temperate small grain cereals,\nthere are a number of distinct differences. Some features such\nas the prominent and persistent nucellar epidermis may\nreflect its phylogenetic position as intermediate between rice\nand the Triticeae (Kellogg, 2001). However, other traits such\nas thick-walled endosperm cells and the lack of a modified\naleurone may be distinctive for wild grasses.\nCell walls are a major component of the Brachypodium\nendosperm\nMembers of the Triticeae are generally rich in starch in the\nform of bimodal granules (Tomlinson et al., 2003), but\nBrachypodium endosperm cells tend to have smaller even-\nsized granules. The central endosperm cells tend to be much\nsmaller than the equivalent cells in wheat with relatively\nthicker cell walls. The cell walls have a similar compositional\nprofile to those of barley and oats in that they have more\nb-glucan than AXs but their overall composition is unique\namongst the small grain cereals examined. Analysis of\nseedling leaf cell walls in Brachypodium also revealed profiles\ndistinctive from those of wheat and barley. This was\nillustrated most dramatically by increased expression of\nBdCSL (cellulose synthase-like) genes (involved in b-D-glucan\nbiosynthesis) and distinctive proportions of the constituents\nof hydroxycinnamic acids (Christensen et al., 2009).\nCell wall-associated materials may act as a storage\nproduct, and the germinating grain seems to re-mobilize\nthese materials associated with the later stages of germina-\ntion. A significant decrease in calcofluor staining was\nobserved in the cell walls of the central endosperm between\n3 d and 6 d post-germination (Supplementary Fig. S3B, D\nat JXB online) while the cell walls of the nucellar epidermis\nand aleurone remained relatively intact in comparison. Cell\nwalls act in this capacity in a variety of seeds, including\nFig. 5. Composition of the mature Brachypodium grain.

FT-IR analysis of the\nendosperm cell walls of Brachypodium showed a pronounced\nshoulder at 980 cm\u00011 that suggests the presence of insoluble\nhemicelluloses. Indeed, coffee beans are extremely hard\nbecause of hemicelluloses present in thick cell walls of the\nendosperm (Sutherland et al., 2004), and an alternative\npossible function, not mutually exclusive with storage, is to\nact as a physical barrier in seed defence. The overall high\nprotein content relative to starch (Larre et al., 2010) and the\npredominance of glutelin-type storage proteins positions\nBrachypodium grain composition closer to that of oats than\nto that of wheat (Larre et al., 2010).\nHard grains (due to the thick cell walls) may have\nadaptive significance in relation to insect predation. Ants\nare a major grain predator for Brachypodium in some\nregions, and some ant species feed almost exclusively on\ngrass grains. While a correlation with a particular grain\ncomposition is not clearly defined, in some studies granivo-\nrous ants generally favour elongated rather than round\ngrains and grains that have obvious awns or hairs pro-\njecting (Pulliam and Brand, 1975). Some grains have\nmechanical properties, such as hardness, to protect against\npredation while positively influencing dispersal (Oliveras\net al., 2008), and it seems likely that cell walls may\ncontribute to this.\nDifferences in grain organization may reflect different\ngrain-filling mechanisms\nThe generally accepted conduit for maternal nutritional\nsupplies early in wheat endosperm development (Wang\net al., 1994a, b, c) appears to be modified in Brachypodium.\nFirst, the nucellar projection is very much reduced through-\nout development. Secondly, the inner integument layer that\nforms the seed coat (a waterproof barrier) differentiates\nvery early in the grain (4 DAA). Finally, the modified\naleurone layer is absent as judged by several independent\ntests. This suggests that the modified aleurone layer is\na distinctive feature of the Triticeae and can be addressed in\na wider comparative analysis extending to neighbouring\ntribes. The modified aleurone layer is implicated as a major\ntransfer tissue in wheat (Wang et al., 1994c). However,\nan alternative transport route may exist as the nucellar\nepidermis is persistent, similar to rice grains. Rice has\ntwo pathways involved in the transport of nutrients to the\ndeveloping caryopsis: one via a pathway analogous to the\nnucellar projection pathway and the other via the nucellar\nepidermis (Krishnan and Dayanandan, 2003). Brachypo-\ndium grain conformation may be more similar to rice in this\nrespect than to wheat, barley, or maize, which have obvious\nmodified aleurone transfer layers adjacent to the maternal\nvascular crease. Rice has a vascular system extending the\nlength of the grain, whereas the vascular tissue supplying\nthe maize grain terminates at the junction of the funiculus\nand ovule (as in Arabidopsis). Maize, in turn, has a pro-\nnounced transfer cell layer within the endosperm, i.e. the\nbasal endosperm transfer layer (BETL). Rice lacks this\nbasal differentiation within its endosperm tissue and may\nutilize an alternative nucellar epidermis-mediated transport\nroute (Ellis and Chaffey, 1987). Throughout caryopsis\ndevelopment in rice, the nucellar epidermis is present as\nan intact layer, but during the later stage of grain filling,\nthe nucellar epidermis along with integument and pericarp\nbecomes compressed. This compression coincides with con-\ntinued endosperm expansion and filling. The structural\nFig. 6. Schematic summarizing grain development.

As in rice, the\nlack of a transfer cell layer in Brachypodium is coupled with\nthe persistence of a functional nucellar epidermis whose\ncross-walls are rich in plasmodesmata. The nucellar epider-\nmis in Brachypodium is well developed along the whole\ncaryopsis, and is minimally compressed by expanding\nendosperm (Fig. 2D). Therefore, it could play a major part\nin assimilate transport into the caryopsis. Indeed, the\nthickened cell walls of the nucellar epidermis may contrib-\nute to alternative carbon storage (Supplementary Fig. S3 at\nJXB online). Alternatively they may provide additional\ndefence against predation.\nAleurone differentiation and organization\nThese results indicate that the aleurone differentiates\nrelatively late in Brachypodium, lacks regional specializa-\ntion, and is structurally integral with the central endo-\nsperm. Moreover, the number of cell layers contributing\nto the aleurone varies both locally and regionally\u2014\nabaxially the aleurone appears to be several cells deep in\nterms of BdGLO1 expression patterns and vital staining\nbut thinner and more homogeneous on the adaxial side.\nThe number of cell layers in the aleurone is characteristic\nof the cereal species, with wheat, rye, oats, maize, and\nsorghum having a single aleurone layer and rice and\nbarley having three layers (Kent and Evers, 1994). These\nlayers have a high protein and lipid content but low\nstarch. Several genes are expressed in the aleurone, either\nspecifically or strongly up-regulated, and serve as good\nmarkers to follow its early development and subsequent\ndifferentiation.\nBrachypodium has potential as a rapid and cost-effective\nmodel for dissecting numerous aspects of grass biology,\nproviding a small rapid cycling model whose biology has\nnot been influenced, at least directly, by humans. This paper\nprovides a comprehensive cellular and molecular descrip-\ntion of grain development in the reference strain, Bd21,\nproviding a reference map that will underpin future work\non genetic control of Brachypodium grain development.\nIn addition it was used as the basis for the first detailed\ncomparison of grain development in Brachypodium and\nrelated cereals. This analysis of grain development indicates\nthat, although somewhat more closely allied to the Triti-\nceae, Brachypodium is intermediate in many respects be-\ntween this group and rice, with some features that may be\nunique to wild and forage grasses. Thus the Brachypodium\ngrain is not only a good model for many aspects of cereal\nbiology but it will also be informative in understanding the\nevolution of diversity in grain structure across the grasses.\nA greater understanding of the significant differences\nbetween the grains of non-crop species to the nutritional\nstorehouses of cultivated cereals\u2014which have been subject\nto intensive breeding during domestication\u2014should provide\nknowledge to ensure greater yields and food security\n(Sabelli and Larkins, 2009).\nSupplementary data\nSupplementary data are available at JXB online.\nFigure S1.
