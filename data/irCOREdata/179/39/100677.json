However, there are incon-\nsistencies between understanding the atomistic nature of\nsolid-solid phase transformations and the current model of\nstress-dependent growth. Current atomistic theory suggests\ngrowth occurs via nucleation of two-dimensional crystal\nislands of the growing phase with subsequent migration of\nisland ledges in the interface between the two phases [4,5].\nHowever, the current stress-dependent growth model does\nnot address this and assumes growth occurs via a single,\nunspecified atomistic process [6]. In this Letter, a model of\nstress-dependent growth is presented to account for new\nexperimental observations of stress-dependent growth ki-\nnetics in conjunction with the current understanding of the\natomistic nature of growth.\nThe current model used to describe the influence of a\nstress state, \u0001ij, on the macroscopic velocity, v, of an\nadvancing growth interface is given by the activation strain\ntensor, \u0001V\u0002ij \u0003 kT@ ln\u0004v\u0005=@\u0001ij, given by\n v \u0003 v\u00040\u0005 exp\n\u0001\u0001V\u0002ij\u0001ij\nkT\n\u0002\n; (1)\nwhere v\u00040\u0005 is the stress-free velocity, kT has the usual\nmeaning, and i and j refer to axes in the coordinate frame\nof reference [6]. By convention, 1 and 2 are the in-plane\ndirections, 3 is the growth direction, and positive (negative)\nelements of \u0001ij are tensile (compressive). The basis for\nEq. (1) is the observation that for many solid-solid phase\ntransformations, v\u00040\u0005 \u0003 v0 exp\u0004\u0001\u0001G\u0002=kT\u0005 over a wide\ntemperature range where v0 is a temperature-independent\nprefactor and \u0001G\u0002 is the activation energy for macroscopic\ngrowth as given by transition state theory (TST) [7,8].\nHowever, Eq. (1) assumes a single, unspecified atomistic\nprocess is responsible for growth thus contradicting current\nunderstanding of solid-solid phase transformations [4,5].\nHence, it is assumed \u0001V\u0002ij \u0003 \u0001Vnij \u0006 \u0001Vmij , where \u0001Vnij\nand \u0001Vmij are the activation strain tensors associated with\nnucleation and migration processes [6]. The use of \u0001V\u0002ij is\naccepted for stressed solid phase epitaxial growth (SPEG)\nof (001) Si amorphized via ion-implantation [1,6,9,10].\nHowever, using new results of stressed SPEG of (001) Si\nas a model system, a model of stressed solid-solid phase\ntransformations is advanced which isolates the nucleation\nand migration processes. The results suggest that coordi-\nnated atomic motion may play a role in island ledge\nmigration.\nIn this study, a polished 50 \u0002m-thick (001) Si wafer was\nSi\u0006-implanted at 50, 100, and 200 keV to doses of 1\u0007\n1015, 1\u0007 1015, and 3\u0007 1015 cm\u00012. Subsequently, samples\nwere cleaved along h110i directions into \b0:2\u0007 1:8 cm2\nstrips (with 1 and 2 directions taken to be [110] and \t1\u000210\n\ncrystal directions) and uniaxially-stressed up to magnitude\nof 1:3\u000b 0:1 GPa along [110] (\u000111) as presented elsewhere\n[11]. Stress-free, tensilely stressed, and compressively\nstressed strips were annealed simultaneously at 525 \fC in\nN2 ambient for 1.0\u2013 4.0 h. No detectable stress relaxation\noccurred during annealing. Growth was examined using\nweak-beam dark-field (WBDF) cross-sectional transmis-\nsion electron microscopy (XTEM). XTEM specimens\n\b10 \u0002m long were prepared via focused ion beam milling\nwithin a lateral distance of \u000b3 mm from the strip centers to\nminimize the presence of any thermal gradient. Because of\nthe very small specimen length to strip length ratio, it is\nreasonably assumed no intraspecimen stress gradients\nexisted.\nFigure 1(a) presents a WBDF-XTEM image of the as-\nimplanted structure indicating an initial amorphous (\u0003) Si\nlayer 350\u000b 5 nm thick continuous to the surface as con-\nfirmed using selected area diffraction. Following annealing\nfor 4.0 h with \u000111 \u0003 0, shown in Fig. 1(e), 138\u000b 5 nm of\ngrowth occurred with the error in all growth measurements\ngiven as the root-mean squared roughness of the\n\u0003=crystalline (growth) interface.

As reported by others, these defects\ndo not interact with the growth interface and do not influ-\nence SPEG kinetics [8,12]. In the cases of \u000111 \u0003 \u00010:5,\n\u00011:0, and \u00011:3 GPa, shown in Figs. 1(b)\u20131(d), 77\u000b 9,\n72\u000b 8, and 68\u000b 9 nm of growth occurred which is less\nthan the \u000111 \u0003 0 case. Growth interface roughening was\nobserved with \u000111 < 0, consistent with prior reports [9\u2013\n11]. For cases of \u000111 \u0003 0:5, 1.0, and 1.3 GPa, shown in\nFigs. 1(f)\u20131(h), 138\u000b 6 nm of growth occurred, similarly\nto the \u000111 \u0003 0 case. The surface-EOR distance showed no\ndetectable variation between as-implanted and annealed\nspecimens indicating no detectable flow of \u0003-Si [13].\nAnnealing of specimens for 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 h was per-\nformed for all values of \u000111 and the resulting amounts of\ngrowth measured (not presented). From this data, v versus\n\u000111 was calculated as presented in Fig. 2. No detectable\ndifference was observed in v for 0 \r \u000111 \r 1:3 GPa with\nv \u0003 34\u000b 2 nm=h. In compression, v was retarded to a\nlimiting rate of 17\u000b 2 nm=h for \u00011:3 \r \u000111 \r \u00010:5,\nwhile \u000111 \u0003 \u00010:25 GPa retarded v to 22\u000b 2 nm=h. The\npredicted [6] behavior of v versus \u000111 is provided for\nreference. No predicted increases in v were observed for\n0<\u000111 while retardation for \u000111 < 0 was consistent with\nprior work [6,9\u201311]. However, in compression, the retar-\ndation appears to reach a limit and the reductions are\ngreater than predicted.\nGrowth results from nucleation of two-dimensional\ncrystal islands and subsequent in-plane migration of island\nledges [4,5]. The rate of island nucleation, \u0004\u00011n , is a scalar\nproperty while the rate of ledge migration, \u0004\u00011m;ij, is a second\norder tensor property analogous to diffusivity given by\n \u0004\u00011m;ij \u0003 \u0004\n\u00011\nm;11 0\n0 \u0004\u00011m;11\n !\n; (2)\nfor the \u0003-Si=\u0004001\u0005 Si interface for \u0001ij \u0003 0. The velocity of\nledge migration is given by vm;i \u0003 \u0004\u00011m;ij\u0001xj, where \u0001xj, is\nthe ledge migration vector dependent on the crystallogra-\nphy of the interface and the coordinate frame of reference\n(in this case, \u0001x1 \u0003 \u0001x2 \u0003 0:38 nm) with both vm;1 and\nvm;2 contributing to v. Furthermore, vm;i is not subject to\nany symmetry requirements and thus vm;1 and vm;2 are\nreasonably assumed independent of one another. The nu-\ncleation of crystal islands with monolayer thickness \u0001x\n(0.14 nm) causes additional contribution to v. However,\nnucleation and migration are sequential and both must be\naccomplished for growth to proceed. Thus, v is given by\n v \u0003 11\n\u0004\u00011n \u0001x\n\u0006 1\u0004\u00011m;11\u0001x1\n\u0006 11\n\u0004\u00011n \u0001x\n\u0006 1\u0004\u00011m;11\u0001x2\n: (3)\nBoth \u0004\u00011n and \u0004\u00011m;ij are presumably Arrhenius processes and\ncan be modified via application of \u0001ij as given by TST [7].\nHowever, since \u0004\u00011m;ij is a tensor property, \u0001V\nm;ij\nkl \u0003\nkT@ ln\u0004\u0004\u00011m;ij\u0005=@\u0001kl, a fourth-order tensor, describes the\nchange in \u0004\u00011m;ij with respect to \u0001kl where k and l refer to\naxes in the coordinate frame of reference.

The value of \u0004n\u00040\u0005 is nearly 30 times\n\u0004m;11\u00040\u0005 which is consistent with prior observations\nsuggesting nucleation is slower than migration [5]. The\npositive value of \u0001Vm;1111 suggests in-plane expansion asso-\nciated with ledge migration. Presumably, this expansion\noccurs to allow easier bond rearrangement (resulting from\nthe \u0003-Si to Si phase transformation) at an island ledge. In\nthe case of 0 \u000e \u000111, Eq. (6) reduces to the tensile satura-\ntion velocity, vt \u000f 2\u0001x=\u0004n\u00040\u0005, and growth is limited by\nnucleation. However, in the case of \u000111 \u000e 0, Eq. (6) re-\nduces to the compressive limit velocity, vc \u000f \u0001x=\u0004n\u00040\u0005,\nand growth is still nucleation limited. Thus, it is predicted\nthat vt=vc \b 2 independently of growth temperature. It is\nimportant to note the interfacial roughening with \u000111 < 0\nwhich generates off-axis growth interfaces which grow up\nto \b25 times slower than [001] SPEG [15]. However, this\ncannot primarily account for the retardation with \u000111 < 0\nsince vt=vc \b 2.\nThe \u0003-Si=\u0004001\u0005 Si interface model advanced by\nSpaepen [4] is used as a basis for an atomistic picture of\nstressed-SPEG in conjunction with the work of Williams\net al. [5] suggesting growth is a two-step process. Figure 3\npresents atomistic schematics of the SPEG migration pro-\ncess with different \u000111. For \u000111 \u0003 0, shown in Fig. 3(a), a\ncrystal island nucleates and the crystal ledges migrate\n(indicated by arrows) rapidly and evenly in both in-plane\ndirections since \u0004m;ij\u00040\u0005\u00011 is isotropic. In the case of 0<\n\u000111, shown in Fig. 3(b), a crystal island nucleates and ledge\nmigration along 1 is enhanced relative to 2. Thus, nuclea-\ntion is the limiting step for 0 \r \u000111 since migration is rapid\nin both directions explaining why v does not change for\n0 \r \u000111 contradictory to the predicted [6] behavior. With\n\u000111 < 0, shown in Fig. 3(c), migration along 1 is retarded\nbut unchanged along 2. Thus, the growth rate is effectively\nhalved since only migration along 2 effectively contributes\nto the growth rate. This explains why v cannot be retarded\nindefinitely by \u000111 < 0 as predicted [6].\nThe presented stressed-SPEG model explains interfacial\nroughening during stressed SPEG in other material sys-\ntems [16] as well as interface roughening observed in this\nand prior studies of stressed Si SPEG [9\u201311]. A growth\ninterface with perturbations under in-plane macroscopic\ncompression, shown in Fig. 4(a), has localized concen-\ntrated in-plane compressive stress (\u0001local11 ) in the troughs\nof the interface and localized tensile stress in the peaks of\nthe interface, since \u0003-Si is near fully relaxed at 525 \fC\n[13]. Thus, as per Eq. (6), the peaks grow faster than the\ntroughs and the interface roughens. However, the applica-\ntion of macroscopic tension, shown in Fig. 4(b), causes a\nreversal of the localized stress states which dampens\nany perturbations in the growth interface due to kinetic\nlimitations. Hence, this model explains observed morpho-\nlogical instabilities during stressed solid-solid phase\ntransformations.\nInterestingly, the actual data from prior work [6] does\nshow that v increases (retards) with 0<\u000111 (\u000111 < 0) in\nsome (though not all) specimens. However, though Eq. (1)\nseems to describe the data from Ref. [6], there are many\nsignificant deviations in the data from this trend and the\n\u03b1 \u03c3-Si\n[001]\n[110]\n[110]\nSi\n11 = 0(a) 0 < 11(b) \u03c311 < 0(c)\nvm,2\nvm,1\n\u03c3\nFIG. 3.

It is\nmentioned in Ref. [6] that intrasample thermal fluctuations\nmay have influenced the results and the analysis techniques\nused were less site-specific relative those used in this study\ngiving rise to the possible influence of intraspecimen stress\ngradients. Also, j\u000111j \r 0:6 GPa was applied in prior\nwork [6] which is smaller than the range used in this study.\nHowever, while these issues may explain why the scatter in\nthe presented work is less than prior work, it is important to\nnote Aziz et al. [6] were the first to observe and model\nstress-influenced SPEG kinetics.\nFurthermore, the prior model [6] of growth occurring via\na single, unspecified process is a reasonable theory to\nexplain the somewhat scattered results observed in\nRef. [6]. However, Eq. (6) provides an equally reasonable\nexplanation for the prior data and the model of Ref. [6]\ncannot reasonably explain the results presented in this\nstudy. Thus, consideration of the nucleation and migration\nprocesses during growth is necessary to explain the new\nresults.\nImportantly, the results provide suggestions as to the\natomistic nature of migration during solid-solid phase\ntransformations. In particular, the large value of \u0001Vm;1111\nsuggests that in-plane ledge motion is coordinated and\ninvolves the lateral advancement of multiple atoms along\na growing island ledge rather than individual atomic mo-\ntion as originally suggested [6]. Analogous coordination is\nobserved in the deformation of metals which is typically\ncharacterized by activation volumes on the order of \b100\ntimes the atomic volume of the material [17,18]. Thus,\n\u0001Vm;1111 \u0003 \u000412\u000b 1\u0005 \u0003 is reasonable considering migration\nmay be coordinated and not due to independent atomic\nmotion.\nIn summary, this study of stressed-SPEG of (001) Si\nstrongly suggests the currently accepted model of stressed\nsolid-solid phase transformations cannot reasonably ex-\nplain the stress-dependent growth kinetics observed in\nthis study. To explain these results, an atomistic model of\nstressed solid-solid phase transformation kinetics is ad-\nvanced which considers growth to be mediated by crystal\nisland nucleation with subsequent island ledge migration\nwith applied stress altering each process differently. This\napproach of isolating nucleation and migration processes\nnot only explains the observed growth kinetics, but also\nmorphological instabilities observed in this and prior stud-\nies of stressed solid-solid phase transformations. The re-\nsults also suggest that in-plane migration may involve\ncoordinated motion of atoms along a growing island ledge.\nThe authors acknowledge the Semiconductor Research\nCorporation for funding this research and the Major\nAnalytical Instrumentation Center at the University of\nFlorida for use of the transmission electron microscope\nand focused ion beam facilities.\n*Corresponding author.\nngr@ufl.edu\n[1] E.
