Introduction \n \nThixoforming is one branch of semi-solid metal processing, which is the forming of \nalloys in the semi-solid state to near net shaped products. It relies on the thixotropic \nbehaviour of alloys which have a spheroidal rather than a dendritic microstructure in \nthe semisolid state. The spheroidal microstructure is typically obtained by stirring \nduring casting (for example using Magneto Hydrodynamic stirring in the MHD \ntechnique) or by reheating material which has been worked by rolling or extrusion in \nthe strain induced melt activated (SIMA) and recrystallisation and partial melting \n(RAP) routes. When sheared, semisolid alloys with spheroidal microstructure flow \nwith the viscosity of heavy machine oil and thus can fill a die in a smooth, laminar \nway, minimising defects normally associated with, for example, die casting. \nThixoforming is normally carried out with between 30% and 50% liquid. As it \ninvolves a solid billet being reheated into the semisolid state, liquid fractions beyond \n50% tend to lead to slumping and collapse of the billet. Reviews include those by \nFlemings [1], Kirkwood [2], Fan [3], de Figueredo [4] and Atkinson [5]. \n \nAlmost all commercial thixoforming is carried out with the conventional casting \nalloys, A356 and A357. There is a demand to widen the range of alloys, including \nthose with higher performance which are conventionally wrought. However, practical \nexperience has highlighted a number of difficulties including: the steep slope of the \nfraction liquid versus temperature curve for alloys such as 6061 [6,7], hot tearing for \nalloys such as 2014 [8-10] and high hot cracking susceptibility for 6082 and 7075 \n[11]. Considerable effort is therefore being directed to understanding what influences \nthixoformability (i.e. formability in the semi-solid state) [11-19].  \n \nCamacho et al. [19] investigated quantitatively the potential of thermodynamic \npredictions for identifying thixoformable compositions in the wrought aluminium \n7xxx series and the effect of the alloying elements on fraction liquid during \nsolidification and on the phases in equilibrium and non-equilibrium in the Al-Zn-Mg-\nCu system by using MTDATA, along with the NPL alloy solution database and SGTE \n(Scientific Group Thermodata Europe) database. Note that in this work \u2018Scheil type\u2019 \nconditions were assumed on the grounds that \u2018during thixoforming, reheating into the \nsemi-solid state takes place rapidly (e.g. ~2 min overall in the Sheffield rig) by \ninduction heating. There is, therefore, insufficient time for equilibrium to be \nestablished.\u2019 In the current work, we have given further consideration to the matter of \nunder what circumstances Scheil conditions might be applicable and this is discussed \nin Section 2.   \n \nIn this paper, we focus on thixoformability criteria which can be investigated with \nthermodynamic prediction. The criteria we have selected are: \n1. The highest \u2018knee\u2019 on the fraction liquid versus temperature curve should \noccur between 30 and 50% liquid (see schematic in Figure 1); this is the \nbinary eutectic temperature i.e. the temperature at which \u03b1 - solid solution \nstarts melting. The amount of liquid at the \u2018knee\u2019 is the amount of eutectic in \nthe structure. We would argue that, if this occurs between 30 and 50% liquid, \nliquid formation tends to be controllable because, kinetically, the rate of liquid \nformation with time (i.e. the rate of melting of \u03b1 solid solution spheroids) \nabove the knee tends to be slower than that below. Evidence for this will be \ngiven in the experimental results with DSC for A356.  \n2. Fraction liquid sensitivity at 0.4 fraction liquid, 4.0)\/( =LfL dTdf , should be \nas small as possible, let us say less than 0.03 K-1, on the following basis. \nExperience in thixoforming suggests that the minimum \u2018working window\u2019 \nbetween the temperature at which the fraction liquid is 0.3, 3.0T , and that at \nwhich it is 0.5, 5.0T , is about 6K. This arises because, in induction heating, the \n\u2018skin\u2019 is heated first and the heat must then be conducted into the interior. This \ntakes a finite period of time and during this period the outer skin temperature \nis still rising. If the fraction liquid in the outer skin exceeds 0.5 then it is likely \nthat liquid will start to drip off the outside. Meanwhile, the temperature at the \ncentre may not have reached a level such that there is sufficient liquid present \nfor forming (i.e. > 0.3 fraction liquid). Assuming, for the sake of explanation, \nthat the fraction liquid versus temperature curve is a straight line between 0.3 \nfraction liquid and 0.5 (i.e. in the thixoformable regime),  \n1\n3.05.04.0\n03.0\n6\n2.03.05.0~ \u2212==\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb K\nTTdT\ndf L . Note that this figure is specific to \nthixoforming where the heating is taking place by, for example, induction \nheating, and time is required for conduction of heat inwards through the billet. \nThe figure is a representative one for a slug size which would be typical of \nprocessing to produce automotive components of approximately 0.5 kg. For \nalloy systems other than aluminium, a different figure would be required to \nallow for a different conductivity. Other workers (viz. [18]) have proposed a \nfigure of 0.015K-1 more generally for semisolid processes, includes routes \nsuch as rheoforming, based on temperature control to within +3K during \nprocessing. Large 4.0)\/( =LfL dTdf will result in substantial variation of the \nfraction liquid with a small change in temperature. (We have chosen 0.4 fL as \nthe measuring point because this is mid-way through the working range of 30-\n50% liquid). \n3. The solidification interval, the temperature interval between the liquidus \nand solidus, should not be too wide, let us say less than 130 K.  This \ncriterion originates from the finding that 2014, with a solidification interval of \n131K [8], is on the limit of thixoformability [9] because of susceptibility to hot \ntearing. A356, which is a typical casting alloy, has a solidification interval of \n71K [20].  \n \nIn addition, precipitates formed during ageing after solution treatment and water \nquenching should give rise to age-hardening to improve the mechanical properties. \nThis is not considered further here. \n \nAlloy compositions targeted for thixoforming need to give mechanical properties \nwhich are close to those of wrought aluminium alloys. In this work, the effect on \nthixoformability of adding copper to A356 to improve mechanical properties and \nadding silicon to 2014 to reduce the hot tearing tendency have been investigated. In \naddition, a range of alloy compositions based on Al-Si-Cu and Al-Si-Cu-Mg have \nbeen evaluated. The alloy composition space explored is wider than that examined by \nKazakov [13].  \n \n2. Prediction method \n \nThermodynamic modelling using Thermo-Calc, ChemSage or MTDATA can \nsupplement\/complement experimental work and can be used as a guide to alloy \ndevelopment for thixoforming. Here, MTDATA (version 4.73), a thermodynamic \nprediction software package, developed by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), \nwas used to predict the phases in equilibrium and non-equilibrium (viz. Scheil) \nconditions. Data was drawn from the Al database MTAL (version 5.01 also supplied \nby NPL). The built-in procedure TSCHEIL was available with MTDATA to predict \nthe phases and fraction liquid versus temperature curve in Scheil solidification (i.e. \nwhere there is no diffusion in the solid). Both MTDATA equilibrium and non-\nequilibrium predictions start with the elements distributed homogeneously. The \nthermodynamic package cannot be used to distinguish between solidification from the \nliquid and reheating from the solid. Under Scheil conditions, the first solid to form on \nsolidification has the composition at the intersection of the tie line, at that \ntemperature, 1T , with the solidus. As the temperature decreases to 2T , the next solid to \nform has the composition of the intersection of the tie line for 2T  with the solidus and \nso on. With Scheil conditions, there is no diffusion in the solid and therefore the \nstructure which arises is a cored structure. If we were considering a casting process, \nthis would apply if the cooling is relatively fast. The final structure for a eutectic \naluminium alloy system will consist of cored \u03b1-aluminium with solidified liquid of \nthe eutectic composition. Conversely, if cooling is slow, equilibrium will be \nestablished with diffusion in the solid state throughout cooling and the final structure \nwill consist of solid of composition of the end of the eutectic temperature tie line and \nliquid of eutectic composition. On reheating, for both Scheil and equilibrium, the \nprocess is reversed i.e. there is no difference between the predictions for heating and \nfor cooling.  \n \nIf we now consider reheating in thixoforming, the Scheil calculation is most likely to \napply when the starting material has the cored structure described above, which would \nbe expected if the material has been prepared by the MHD route where the cooling \nshould be relatively fast. With the SIMA and RAP routes, the initial elemental \ndistribution is expected to be relatively uniform apart from where \nparticles\/precipitates are present. For the SIMA route this is because the working (e.g. \nby extrusion) is carried out hot. For the RAP route, it is warm but then further \ndiffusion to achieve homogenisation will occur during reheating for thixoforming. \nThese starting materials may be better represented by equilibrium calculations. In this \npaper, we are seeking to draw the boundaries of thixoformability in relation to alloy \ncomposition, alongside identifying what may be optimum compositions. The state of \nthe starting material is not defined and therefore, for the purposes of comparison we \nhave focussed on Scheil calculations. Results are presented which compare the Scheil \nand equilibrium calculations with the Differential Scanning Calorimetry results for \nboth a cast alloy composition (A356) and a wrought alloy composition (2014). The \nfocus on Scheil predictions is then discussed. \n \nFraction liquid is a critical parameter both for fundamental work and for control of the \nthixoforming process. Prediction of the fraction liquid\/temperature relationship is thus \nuseful for identification of alloy compositions suitable for thixoforming. It is \nnecessary that the fraction liquid does not change too rapidly with temperature in the \nworking window and 0.3-0.5 volume fraction liquid is thought to be desirable for \nthixoformability. The results here are in weight fraction liquid but it is volume \nfraction liquid which is directly relevant to thixoforming. It is not possible to make a \nconversion from weight fraction liquid to volume fraction liquid because the data for \nthe exact compositions and temperatures we need it for is not available in the \nliterature. However, the conversion is likely to be such that the shapes of the curves \n(and hence slopes) are similar to those predicted. The likely difference in absolute \nvalues is probably around 2%, which is confirmed by the conversion in alloy Al-\n5.9wt%Si based on the density data from reference [21]. \n \n3. Experimental work \n \nIn order to compare the fraction liquid versus temperature curve predicted by \nMTDATA with experimental data, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), which \ncan measure directly the evolution of the heat of melting during the solid-liquid phase \ntransformation, was performed to determine the fraction liquid vs. temperature for as-\ncast alloy A356 (Al-6.82Si-0.32Mg-0.022Cu-0.005Zn-0.112Fe-0.1Ti-0.013Pb-\n0.042Sn-0.006Ni-0.005Cr, wt%), and as-extruded 2014 (Al-3.91Cu-0.47Mg-0.83Si-\n0.29Fe-0.55Mn, wt%), using a Dupont 910 Differential Scanning Calorimeter system. \nSamples 3 mm in diameter and about 15 mg in weight were cut, weighed and put into \na carbon pan with a carbon lid, leaving the reference carbon pan empty in an argon \natmosphere. Argon was fed through the system at a flow rate of 80 ml\/min to \nminimize oxidation of the samples. The samples were heated to 680\u00b0C at 10 K\/min \nand then cooled to room temperature at the same rate. The heat flow and temperature \nwere monitored by thermocouples to obtain heating and cooling curves. The fraction \nliquid versus temperature relationship was obtained by integration of partial areas \nunder the heating or cooling curves. \n \n4. Results \n \n4.1 Comparison between MTDATA predictions and DSC curves \n \nFigure 2 shows fraction liquid vs. temperature measured by Differential Scanning \nCalorimetry (DSC) during heating and cooling at 10 K\/min and the solidification \ncurves estimated by MTDATA in equilibrium and non-equilibrium (Scheil). The \ncompositions are: A356 (Al-6.82Si-0.32Mg-0.022Cu-0.005Zn-0.112Fe-0.1Ti-\n0.013Pb-0.042Sn-0.006Ni-0.005Cr, wt%) for DSC; 2014 (Al-3.91Cu-0.47Mg-0.83Si-\n0.29Fe-0.55Mn, wt%) for DSC and MTDATA; and simplified A356 (Al-6.82Si-\n0.32Mg, wt%) for MTDATA. The full composition for A356 cannot be treated with \nMTDATA as some of the elements are not included in the MTAL database. For \nA356, the DSC heating curve lies between the Scheil and equilibrium predictions \ninitially. There is a \u2018knee\u2019 in the Scheil prediction curve at about 5% liquid but not in \nthe equilibrium curve. Then between about 20% liquid and 50% liquid, the Scheil and \nequilibrium curves are coincident but the DSC curve lags slightly in terms of the \namount of liquid for a given temperature. The highest \u2018knee\u2019 then occurs less \ndistinctly in the DSC curve than in the predictions and is at about 60% liquid rather \nthan 50%. It also occurs at a few degrees higher temperature than in the predictions. \nAbove the knee, the fraction liquid is a few percent higher in the DSC curve, for a \nparticular temperature, than in the predictions (which are almost coincident).   \n \nFor 2014, the DSC heating curve is again initially between the equilibrium and Scheil \npredictions. The Scheil curve again has a \u2018knee\u2019 (in this case at about 10% liquid) \nwhere the equilibrium curve does not.  For every point above about 530\u02daC, the \namount of liquid present for a particular temperature is below that predicted by either \nScheil or equilibrium calculations. The Scheil and equilibrium curves are coincident \nabove about 50% liquid. The DSC cooling curve starts solidification at a lower \ntemperature than the calculations predict. Below about 30% liquid it lies between the \nScheil and equilibrium curves and displays a knee mimicking that in the Scheil curve \nbut occurring at a slightly higher temperature and lower fraction liquid. \n \n4.2 Thixoformability estimation for alloy A356 and A356 modified with added copper \n \nAlloy A356 has been widely used as a thixoformable alloy. Figure 3 and Table 1 \nshow the effect of copper on the MTDATA\/Scheil curves of fraction liquid vs. \ntemperature for alloy A356 (Al-7Si-0.3Mg, wt%) and A356 modified with added \ncopper. The slope of the curve at 0.4 fraction liquid is very steep (0.133 K-1 by \nMTDATA\/Scheil in this work for A356, 0.067 K-1 by DSC from Tzimas and \nZavaliangos [12]) for alloy A356, i.e. the liquid fraction sensitivity is relatively higher \nthan for A356 modified with added copper. The slopes of the curves at 0.4 fraction \nliquid, 4.0)\/( =LfL dTdf , become less steep and the fraction liquid sensitivity is reduced \nfrom 0.133 K-1 to 0.007 K-1, and the working window between 0.3 and 0.5 fraction \nliquid (\u2206T0.3\/0.5) is enlarged from 1 to 32 K, when 10 wt% Cu is added. It should be \nnoted from Table 1 and Figure 3 that the solidification interval is significantly \nenlarged by adding copper to A356 due to the ternary (L\u2192\u03b1Al+Si+CuAl2) and \nquaternary (L\u2192\u03b1Al+Si+CuAl2+Mg2Si) reactions which then occur. \n  \n4.3 Thixoformability estimation for wrought aluminium alloys \n \nFigure 4 shows the curves of fraction liquid vs. temperature estimated by \nMTDATA\/Scheil for A356 (Al-7Si-0.3Mg, wt%), A357 (Al-7Si-0.6Mg, wt%) and \nwrought aluminium alloys 2014 (Al-3.91Cu-0.47Mg-0.83Si-0.29Fe-0.55Mn, wt%), \n6082 (Al-1.03Si-0.69Mg-0.25Fe-0.45Mn, wt%), 7075 (Al-5.53Zn-2.21Mg-1.41Cu-\n0.1Si-0.26Fe-0.0Mn, wt%) and 7010 (Al-6.1Zn-2.3Mg-1.63Cu-0.12Si-0.22Fe, wt%), \ncompared with the curves estimated by MTDATA\/Equilibrium for alloys A356 and \n2014. Figure 4 indicates that the amount of eutectic for wrought alloys is less than 10 \nwt% but around 50 wt% for A356 and A357. The slope at 0.4 fraction liquid is very \nsteep for 6082 and A356\/A357, but is relatively flat for 2014, 7075 and 7010, which \nis expected to give a wide processing window in thixoforming. However, the wide \nsolidification interval for wrought alloys 2014, 7075 and 7010 is thought to be \nresponsible for hot tearing. According to the criteria for thixoformability in section 1, \ncomposition adjustment for wrought alloys is needed to increase the amount of \neutectic and decrease the solidification interval. Figure 5 shows an example of how \nthe amount of eutectic has been increased and the solidification interval decreased by \nadding Si to alloy 2014, hence giving alloys which are expected to be more \nthixoformable than alloy 2014. Alloys Al-3.91Cu-0.47Mg-xSi-0.29Fe-0.55Mn, wt%, \nwith Si=3.83~5.83wt%, are likely to be suitable. \n \n4.4 Compositional adjustment for wrought 2014 to aid thixoforming  \n \nAlloy 2014 is one of the heat treatable high strength wrought aluminium alloys. Due \nto its wide solidification interval (131 K by DSC [8]) and the fact that less eutectic \nliquid is available at the last stages of solidification than for the casting alloy A356, \n2014 is considered to be more prone to the formation of porosity. In order to \ninvestigate and improve the thixoformability of alloy 2014, a simplified alloy 2014 \n(Al-4.4Cu-0.5Mg-0.8Si, wt%) was considered. The manganese was taken out of \nconsideration because it has little effect on the fraction liquid vs. temperature curve \n[8]. A series of curves of fraction liquid vs. temperature for alloys Al-xCu-0.5Mg-\n0.8Si and Al-4.4Cu-0.5Mg-xSi (wt%) have been predicted by MTDATA\/Scheil and \nsome parameters have been summarized in Figures 6(a) and (b), respectively. Figure \n6(a) shows the effect of copper on the solidification interval, amount of eutectic, \nprocessing window between 30 and 50% fraction liquid and slope sensitivity at 40% \nfraction liquid for alloys Al-xCu-0.5Mg-0.8Si (wt%). The \u2018amount of eutectic\u2019 \nrepresents the position of the highest \u2018knee\u2019 i.e. criterion 1. The solidification interval \ndecreases (from 156 to 100 K) and the amount of eutectic increases (from 5.9 to \n56.9%) with increase of copper content from 1 to 20 wt%. The slopes of the curves at \n0.4 fraction liquid, 4.0)\/( =LfL dTdf , become flatter from 0.02 to 0.003 K\n-1 when copper \ncontent increases from 1 to 14 wt%, i.e. the sensitivity is reduced. The slope then \nincreases and plateaus (0.029 K-1) with the copper content between 15 and 20 wt% \nbecause the melting is all of eutectic, with a high slope for 4.0)\/( =LfL dTdf , rather than \nof \u03b1- solid solution, with a lower slope. (The highest knee is above 40% liquid for the \nalloys with 15 and 20 wt% copper). The processing window between 0.3 and 0.5 \nfraction liquid increases from 10 to 57 K with increase in copper content from 1 to 11 \nwt% and then becomes narrower as copper increases to 20 wt%. It can be seen that \nalloys Al-(11~17)Cu-0.5Mg-0.8Si (wt%) are most suitable for thixoforming \naccording to criteria 1-3 in Section 1. However, these alloys have limited fluidity [22] \ndue to the high copper content and they are not the first choice for thixoforming.  \n \nFigure 6(b) shows the same parameters for alloy Al-4.4Cu-0.5Mg-xSi (wt%). The \nsolidification interval decreases from 147 to 86 K and the amount of eutectic \nincreases from 11.6 to 85.3% with increase in silicon content from 0.8 to 10 wt%. The \nslope of the curve at 0.4 fraction liquid, 4.0)\/( =LfL dTdf , becomes flatter from 0.01 to \n0.004 K-1 when silicon increases from 0.8 to 4.0 wt%, i.e. the sensitivity is reduced, \nthen the slope increases to a plateau (0.017 K-1) for silicon contents between 6 and 15 \nwt%. It can be seen that alloys Al-4.4Cu-0.5Mg-(4~6)Si (wt%) are most suitable for \nthixoforming according to the criteria in section 1.  \n \n4.5 Thixoformability estimation for the Al-Si-Cu and Al-Si-Cu-Mg alloy systems \n \nFurther prediction has been done based on conventional casting alloys. Curves of \nfraction liquid vs. temperature for Al-Si-Cu and Al-Si-Cu-Mg casting alloys have \nbeen predicted by MTDATA\/Scheil and some solidification parameters have been \nsummarized in Table 2. Alloys 308 (Al-5.5Si-4.5Cu), 319 (Al-6Si-3.5Cu), 238 (Al-\n10Cu-4Si-0.3Mg) and alloy 355 (Al-5Si-1.3Cu-0.5Mg) are particularly suitable for \nthixoforming according to criteria 1-3 in section 1. \n \nSilicon provides good casting characteristics due to the formation of Al-Si eutectic. \nThe addition of copper gives high strength and improved machinability, but with \nsome sacrifice of ductility and resistance to corrosion. Increasing amounts of both \ncopper and silicon in the Al-Si-Cu-Mg system increase the amount of eutectic and \ndecrease the solidification interval. Adding silicon is more effective than copper (see \nFig. 6a and b). Magnesium also increases strength but with less contribution to the \namount of eutectic, compared with copper and silicon at low magnesium contents. \nThe amount of Cu+Si and the ratio Si\/Cu are considered to be important parameters to \ndefine the amount of eutectic and identity of solid state precipitates. From \nconsideration of the Al-Cu, Al-Si and Al-Cu-Si phase diagrams and with magnesium \nfixed at 0.5 wt%, the ranges 7.5\u2264Cu+Si\u226412.5 and 1.5\u2264Si\/Cu\u22642.33 were chosen for \nfurther investigation. The copper content was varied between 2 and 5 wt% to obtain \nage hardening and the silicon content was varied between 3 and 10.5 wt% to obtain \nthe Al-Si eutectic. A series of fraction liquid versus temperature curves were \ncalculated by MTDATA\/Scheil and are shown in Figure 7. Some parameters are \nsummarized in Table 3. At fixed Si\/Cu ratio (for example 1.5), as the Si+Cu content \nincreases, the amount of eutectic increases and solidification interval decreases. At \nfixed Si+Cu content (for example 9), as the Si\/Cu ratio increases, the amount of \neutectic increases and the solidification interval decreases. Based on all the \ncalculations, and not just those presented in Table 3, the alloys within the chosen \nrange (2\u2264Cu\u22645, 3\u2264Si\u226410.5, 7.5\u2264Si+Cu\u226412.5 all in wt%, and 1.5\u2264Si\/Cu\u22642.33) that \nsatisfy the criteria are: Al-Si-Cu-Mg alloys with 7.5\u2264Si+Cu\u22649 and 1.5\u2264Si\/Cu\u22642.33 \nand alloys with 9<Si+Cu \u226410 and Si\/Cu=1.5.   \n \n5. Discussion \n \n5.1 Discrepancies between predictions from MTDATA and results from DSC    \n \nIn Section 2, we discussed the premise that Scheil calculations are most likely to \naccord with starting material which is \u2018cored\u2019, whereas equilibrium calculations \nshould more closely match material which has a homogeneous distribution of the \nelements. From Fig. 2, for A356, the DSC curve initially lies between the two, \nsuggesting that, although the starting material was as-cast, the cooling rate was not \nhigh and therefore the elemental distribution in the \u03b1-solid solution is relatively \nhomogeneous rather than \u2018cored\u2019. However, the material is not entirely homogeneous \nbecause the material between the \u03b1-spheroids starts to melt at about the same \ntemperature as the Scheil calculations predict. The highest knee in the DSC curve is \nthen occurring above the knee in the predictions. This is likely to be due to kinetic \nfactors. Above this knee, it is the \u03b1-solid solution spheroids which are melting rather \nthan any eutectic. The lack of a \u2018sharp\u2019 knee suggests that this process is occurring at \ndifferent stages at various places in the material. It is not clear why the DSC curve \nthen lies above the predictions. To return to the justification for criterion 1 in Section \n1, using the DSC curve, the first 50%-60% of the liquid is being formed in a \ntemperature interval of about 10K (and hence a time of about 1 min given the DSC \nheating rate of 10K\/min), but the next 40-50% liquid (obtained by melting \u03b1-solid \nsolution spheroids) is taking about 4 min to form. This is the basis for the argument \nthat the existence of a knee around 50% liquid gives controllability in the \nthixoforming process. \n \nExamining Fig. 2 for 2014, the DSC heating curve follows the shape of the \nequilibrium curve more closely than that of the Scheil, supporting our premise that \nextruded material should give results closer to equilibrium because the elements \nshould be distributed relatively homogeneously. However, at a particular temperature \nthe amount of liquid in the DSC heating curve lags behind that predicted. This must \nbe due to kinetic factors (it takes nearly 9 mins for 10% liquid to form) in that the \nmelting is almost all of \u03b1-solid solution spheroids, there being little, if any eutectic in \nthe structure. On cooling, it is not clear why there is a discrepancy between the DSC \nand the predicted curves, but the cooling curve then follows the shape of the Scheil \ncurve more closely than that in equilibrium, probably due to the inhomogeneous melt \nresulting from no soaking time before cooling. Towards the end, elements capable of \ntaking part in a eutectic reaction are co-located, so that a knee is observed.  \n \nIn this paper, the focus has been on Scheil predictions for the purposes of comparison \nand for clarity of presentation, although as discussed above there is some evidence \nfrom DSC that equilibrium may be more appropriate for alloys in a wrought starting \ncondition. In terms of the thixoformability criteria, the slope of the fraction liquid \nversus temperature curve at 40% liquid tends to be similar for Scheil and equilibrium \npredictions, with the equilibrium curve slightly steeper (see Fig. 2). For the solidus-\nliquidus interval, the equilibrium curve tends to give a narrower interval than the \nScheil. More alloys will be excluded as a result of this criterion with Scheil results \nthan with equilibrium. Hence, the Scheil results will tend to be conservative from a \npractical point of view. This is probably appropriate given the difficulties with hot \ntearing (the basis for this criterion).   \n \nThe finding that the fractions liquid calculated by using MTDATA\/equilibrium are \nlower than those calculated by applying MTDATA\/Scheil agrees with work in \n[22,23]. Chen and Huang [24] argue that it is likely that some solid state diffusion \ndoes occur during solidification, while concentration gradients still exist, and the real \nfraction liquid should fall between the predictions from MTDATA\/equilibrium and \nMTDATA\/Scheil. They found that ~20 K discrepancy was observed in the DTA \n(differential thermal analysis) cooling curve for binary alloys Al-10wt%Cu, Al-\n4.5wt%Cu, Al-6.5wt%Mg and Al-4.25wt%Mg, compared with the solidification \ncurves calculated by the lever model and Scheil model [24]. A similar discrepancy \nwas found between predictions from MTDATA\/Scheil with Thermo-Calc software \nand experimental results via computer-aided cooling slope curve analysis (CA-CCA) \nby Aliravci et al. [25] for solidification of commercial alloys AA1050, AA5182 and \nAA6111. Empirical correction factors were needed to normalize the Scheil fraction \nsolid versus temperature curves at different cooling rates.  \n \nThere are sources of uncertainty in the MTDATA calculations. These include: \n1) Uncertainty in specification of the composition. Alloy specifications  provide \nlimits for the various amounts of elements. If the slope of the liquidus with \nrespect to the amount of a particular element is large then a different liquidus \ntemperature could be predicted for nominally the same alloy even if the \nmodelling and calculations were perfect. \n2) Parameters in the database not giving \u2018true\u2019 equilibria. Generally for low order \nsystems, binaries say, the calculated results can be thought of as \u2018the results \nthat would be obtained from the perfect experiment\u2019 as they represent the \ndistillation of many different phase diagram and thermodynamic studies. (The \nprediction is not simple curve fitting as thermodynamic measurements such as \nactivities\/enthalpies of mixing etc. are modelled as well as phase diagram \ninformation). If a few elements are added to a well known binary system, such \nas Al-Si or Al-Cu, to form a multicomponent system then extra uncertainties \nshould be small as the basis binary will not be perturbed much. Uncertainties \nwill be larger if many assessed low order systems are combined to form a \nmulticomponent system with many elements present in large amounts. \n3) Missing phases. In general, it may be that there is a phase that is important n \nthe multicomponent system of interest but which is not included in the \ndatabase. This should not be the case here as these are well characterised \nsystems. \n4) Assumption of ideal interactions between components. For some interactions \nbetween elements data is missing and the assumption is made that the \ninteraction is \u2018ideal\u2019. This is a source of uncertainty but again should be \nminimal in the calculations here where the elements are common alloy \ncomponents. \n5) Bulk material. MTDATA calculates a result for a bulk material. Kinetics may \nhave a part to play in reality and results may be different for systems on a very \nsmall scale. This may contribute to the discrepancy between the DSC results \n(which are for relatively small samples) and the predictions.  \n \nTo quantify these uncertainties in detail is the subject of further work. \n \n5.2 Anomaly in thermodynamic prediction \n \nAlthough thermodynamic modelling seems to be a promising approach to identify \nalloy compositions suitable for thixoforming, there are some anomalies. For example, \nin the predictions by MTDATA\/Scheil, alloys A356 and A357 give very steep slopes \nin fraction liquid versus temperature curves in the thixoforming regime (30-50% \nliquid), steeper than those for wrought aluminium alloys such as 2014, 6082, 7075 \nand 7010. Predicted results (using Thermo-Calc software in combination with the Al-\nDATA database [17]) suggest that the suitable fraction liquid range for stable \nprocessing (i.e. where the slope of fraction liquid versus temperature is gentler) is 50-\n70% for alloy A356 rather than 30-50% which implies alloy A356 is more suitable for \nrheocasting than for thixoforming. However, in fact, both alloys A356 and A357 have \nbeen used widely in commercial thixoforming. As discussed above in relation to \ncriterion 1, the origin of this anomaly may lie in the kinetics of melting of \u03b1-solid \nsolution in that, although the slope between 30% liquid and 50% liquid is steep, the \nexistence then of the knee at around 50% liquid allows control of the process; the \nknee, in effect, acts as a \u2018brake\u2019 on the liquid formation. The fact that this occurs at \naround 50% liquid (i.e. the percentage of liquid at the limit before slumping) for A356 \nand A357 is, in essence, the reason why these materials are so suitable for \nthixoforming. Therefore, we can conclude that, if the curve of fraction liquid versus \ntemperature is steep in the 30-50% liquid regime, then there must be a \u2018knee\u2019 at \naround 50% liquid or just below for the alloy to be thixoformable. There is, in effect, \nan interplay between the thermodynamic driving force and the kinetics of melting \n[26]. \n \nIn contrast to A356 and A357, 6082 has an equally steep fraction liquid versus \ntemperature curve between 30 and 50% liquid (see Fig. 4), but there is no \u2018knee\u2019 to \nput a brake on liquid formation, and the alloy is not amenable to thixoforming. \n \n5.3 The effect of addition of copper to alloy A356  \n \nAlloy A356 has excellent casting characteristics, weldability, pressure tightness, and \ncorrosion resistance. It is heat treatable to provide various combinations of tensile and \nphysical properties that are attractive for many applications, including aircraft and \nautomotive parts [27]. The addition of copper to Al-Si alloys causes precursors to \nCuAl2 phases and other intermetallic compounds to form which increase strength and \nheat treatability [28]. However, the addition of copper also reduces hot tear resistance \nand decreases castability [29]. Alloy A356 solidifies over a relatively narrow \ntemperature range of around 60 K, with the final stages of solidification involving \nabout 50% eutectic liquid. Therefore, the feeding of the last eutectic liquid to solidify \nis relatively easy and porosity is rare. With the addition of copper to alloy A356, the \nsolidification interval is enlarged significantly with a range of 117 K for the initial \naddition of 1 wt% Cu. The solidification interval decreases slowly to 91 K as the \ncopper content increases to 10 wt%. C\u00e1ceres et al. [30] investigated the effect of \ncopper additions between 0 and 1% on the level of porosity in Al-Si-Mg alloy (A356) \nand found that a copper content exceeding 0.2% results in a 7-fold increase in \ndispersed microporosity, which is related to the formation of interdendritic ternary \nliquid that solidifies at a lower temperature than the Al-Si eutectic and is therefore \ndifficult to feed. However, increasing the levels of copper beyond 1% and up to 4% \nresults in a relatively small increase in porosity [31]. The MTDATA\/Scheil prediction \nalso showed that the addition of copper to alloy A356 decreases the fraction liquid \nsensitivity at 0.4 fraction liquid and enlarges the working window between 0.3 and 0.5 \nfraction liquid which is of  benefit to thixoforming.  \n \n5.4 Effect of silicon on alloy 2014 \n \nAlloy 2014 is one of the heat treatable high strength wrought aluminium alloys. Due \nto its wide solidification interval (131K by DSC) and the fact that less eutectic liquid \nis available in the last stages of solidification than for the casting alloy A356, 2014 is \nconsidered to be more prone to the formation of porosity.  In order to increase the \nproportion of the eutectic, i.e. increase the \u2018highest knee\u2019 in the fraction liquid vs. \ntemperature curve, and improve the castability for alloy 2014, silicon was added. \nMTDATA\/Scheil prediction shows that this increases the amount of eutectic and \ndecreases the solidification interval which should improve the thixofomability. \n \n5.5 Effect of silicon and copper on the constitution of Al- Si-Cu-Mg alloys  \n \nMTDATA\/Scheil predictions show, for alloy Al-4.4Cu-0.5Mg-xSi, when the silicon \ncontent is 0.8 wt%, that the primary \u03b1-aluminium dendritic network forms below \n642\u00b0C, leading to a monotonic increase in the concentration of copper in the \nremaining liquid. At about 506\u00b0C, a eutectic of CuAl2 with interspersed \u03b1-aluminium \nforms. When 10%)(2 \u2264\u2264 wtSi , a primary \u03b1-aluminium dendritic network forms, then \nthe eutectic solid mixture of silicon and \u03b1-aluminium forms at the Al-Si eutectic \ntemperature (around 560\u00b0C), leading to further increase of the copper content in the \nremaining eutectic liquid. The amount of aluminium-silicon eutectic increases with \nthe increase in silicon content (see Fig. 6b). Thixoforming requires precise control of \nfeedstock reheating to obtain a fraction liquid between 30 and 50%. Heating must \naccomplish melting of the eutectic without also melting too much of the \u03b1-aluminium \nphase. A lower amount of liquid phase (less than 30%) could impede the flow of solid \nphase during thixoforming, however it would become difficult to control the heating \ntemperature and fraction liquid if there was too much liquid (more than 50%), \nresulting in slumping or tilting known as \u201celephant footing\u201d because there is a \ntendency for liquid to migrate to lower billet extremes when the fraction liquid is over \n50% [32]. When the silicon content is 15 wt%, the primary phase is not \u03b1-Al but \nprimary silicon crystal and then the eutectic mixture of silicon and \u03b1-aluminium \nforms. For alloy Al-0.5Mg-0.8Si-xCu (Fig. 6a), the eutectic amounts to less than 8.0% \nat 3%)(1 \u2264\u2264 wtCu . When the copper content increases to 4.4%, the primary \u03b1-\naluminium dendritic network forms and this is followed by the formation of \u03b1Al-\nCuAl2 eutectic . With the copper content increasing from 4.4 to 20 wt%, the amount \nof \u03b1Al-CuAl2 eutectic increases from 11.6 to 56.9%. The increase of eutectic is of \nbenefit to thixoforming due to the associated decrease in hot tearing susceptibility. \nThis is also confirmed by Spittle and Cushway [33] who showed that Al-Cu alloys \n(normally with a wide solidification interval) containing more than 7 wt% Cu \nexhibited minimal and zero hot tearing susceptibility because the higher volume \nfraction of eutectic in the alloys ensures interdendritic feeding and healing of incipient \ntears. \n \nCompared with copper, the addition of silicon is more effective in increasing the \namount of eutectic, i.e. the addition of 1 wt% silicon increases eutectic from 7 to 11% \nbut the addition of 1 wt% copper increases eutectic from 1.4~2.9% (see Fig. 6a and \nb). \n \n5.6 Promising alloys predicted to be suitable for thixoforming \n \nAlloys A356 and A357 have been used widely in semi-solid metal processing in \nrecent years. Other aluminium alloys that have been developed for semi-solid \nprocessing or are in process of development include: AlSi6Cu1Mg (C355) intended \nfor achieving higher strength than alloy 357 while requiring only a T5 temper; \nAlSi6Cu3Mg (319) intended for achieving high tensile, yield strength and hardness in \nthe T6 condition with some sacrifice in ductility; AlMg5Si2 designed for thin walled \nparts (with no heat treatment) requiring medium yield strength and high elongation; \nhyper-eutectic aluminium-silicon alloys intended for wear resistant parts [32] and \nalloy AlSi4Cu2.5Mg [34]. In the present work, commercial casting alloys 308 (Al-\n5.5Si-4.5Cu), 319 (Al-6Si-3.5Cu), 238 (Al-10Cu-4Si-0.3Mg) and 355 (Al-5Si-1.3Cu-\n0.5Mg) and modified alloys based on 2014, Al-4.4Cu-0.5Mg-(4~6)Si, and a range \nalloys ((7.5\u2264Si+Cu\u22649 and 1.5\u2264Si\/Cu\u22642.33) and alloys (9<Si+Cu \u226410 and Si\/Cu=1.5) \nbased on Al-Si-Cu-Mg system have been identified to be promising alloys for \nthixoforming. The predictions in this work include most of the alloys which have been \ntested in practical thixoforming. However it is difficult to explore the whole alloy \nspace with the thermodynamic prediction method. Hence, for example Al-7Si-3Cu-\nMg (AS7U3G), has not been included (it does not match the compositions in Table 2 \nbecause Mg is not 0.5 wt%), but is thixoformable with high tensile properties (UTS \n440 MPa, YS 340 MPa, EL 9~10%) [35]. Also some alloys such as alloys Al-7Si-\n0.3Mg-(1~4)Cu are possible candidates allowing for discrepancies and anomalies in \nthermodynamic prediction. \n \n6. Conclusions \n \nMTDATA thermodynamic software (supplied by the UK National Physical \nLaboratory) has been used to investigate the effects of compositional variations, in \nparticular the effect of added copper on the thixoformability of alloy A356 (Al-7Si-\n0.3Mg, wt%) and the effect of added silicon on the thixoformability of alloy 2014 \n(Al-3.91Cu-0.47Mg-0.83Si-0.29Fe-0.55Mn, wt%). The slopes of the curves of \nfraction liquid vs. temperature at 40% fraction liquid become less steep and the \nworking window between 30 and 50% fraction liquid is enlarged by adding up to 10 \nwt% copper to alloy A356. The addition of silicon increases the amount of eutectic \nand decreases the solidification interval in alloy 2014. This should benefit \nthixoformability and also decrease the tendency for formation of porosity. A range of \nalloy compositions based on Al-Si-Cu and Al-Si-Cu-Mg have been evaluated \naccording to criteria for thixoformability. Those which are most suitable according to \nthese criteria include alloys 308 (Al-5.5Si-4.5Cu, wt%), 319 (Al-6Si-3.5Cu, wt%), \n238 (Al-10Cu-4Si-0.3Mg, wt%), 355 (Al-5Si-1.3Cu-0.5Mg, wt%) and 2014 based \nalloys Al-4.4Cu-0.5Mg-(4~6)Si. Alloys with 7.5\u2264Si+Cu\u22649 and 1.5\u2264Si\/Cu\u22642.33 and \nalloys with 9<Si+Cu \u226410 and Si\/Cu=1.5 also satisfy the criteria.  The \u2018highest knee\u2019 \nin the fraction liquid vs. temperature curve, i.e. the temperature at which \u03b1-solid \nsolution starts melting, plays a critical role in putting a \u2018brake\u2019 on the liquid formation \nif the fraction liquid versus temperature curve is steep in the 30 to 50% liquid regime.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors would like to acknowledge the University of Leicester for financial \nsupport and National Physical Laboratory for the supply of MTDATA \nthermodynamic software and for helpful advice.  \n \nReferences \n \n1.
