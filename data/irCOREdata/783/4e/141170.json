Training to reduce the tendency to engage in avoidance coping strategies, improve \nevaluative coping strategies and hazard monitoring when under stress may improve bus driver safety. \n \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \nIt has been well documented that bus driving can be a highly stressful occupation (Bartone, \n1989) resulting from high and conflicting demands and lack of control over work pace and \ndriving situations (Evans and Carrere., 1991; Carrere et al., 1991; Evans., 1994).  Factors \nintrinsic to the job such as time pressure, long shifts and responsibility for passenger safety \ncan all contribute to bus driver stress. Apart from its toll on health and well being at work \n(Taylor and Dorn, 2005) there is also good reason to suppose that bus driver stress and \nfatigue may be lead to an increased risk of being involved in a bus crash (Greiner et al., \n1998). Driver stress may impair performance, or distract the driver from maintaining safety \nthrough potentially dangerous coping strategies such as reacting aggressively to other traffic \nor engaging in self-distraction.  \n \nOne way of measuring emotional reactions to driving is with the use of the Driver \nStress Inventory's (DSI: Matthews et al., 1996; 1997) five scales of Aggression, Dislike of \nDriving, Hazard Monitoring, Thrill Seeking and Fatigue Proneness. The DSI scales have \nbeen found to be associated with self reported crashes (Matthews et al., 1991) and violations, \nperformance decrements and\/or risk taking amongst both commuter drivers (Dorn and \nMatthews, 1995) and professional drivers (\u00d6z et al., 2009; Kontogiannis, 2006; Dorn, 2005) \nand correlated with different aspects of simulated driving behaviour in an expected direction \naccording to the transactional theory of driver stress (Matthews et al., 1998). \n \nThe transactional theory of driver stress (Matthews, 2002) predicts that personality \nfactors interact with situational traffic demands to elicit cognitive processes that mediate the \neffects of driver stress vulnerability on both subjective outcomes (e.g., emotional distress) \nand objective behavioural outcomes dependent upon  specific stress responses. For example, \nDislike of Driving is associated with tense moods and a perceived lack of control and is \n4 \nassociated with driver error, whereas Aggression is associated with risk taking, anger and \nnegative appraisals of other drivers.  \n \nCoping with driver stress as measured via the Driver Coping Questionnaire\u201fs (DCQ) \n(Matthews et al., 1997) reveals five distinct driver coping strategies based on original coping \nresearch by Lazarus and Folkman (1984). Task-focused Coping involves active attempts to \nincrease vigilance when driving is difficult or demanding (Matthews et al., 1998). \nReappraisal measures the extent to which the driver evaluates what mistakes were made \n(Matthews et al., 1998). Emotion-focused Coping involves a strategy whereby the driver \nruminates over their performance and self-blames for the difficulties they encounter. This \nbehaviour appears to distract drivers from the primary task of driving safely (Matthews and \nWells, 1996). Confrontive Coping involves the mastery of traffic through self-assertion or \nconflict (Matthews, 2001).  Finally, Avoidance Coping was originally described by Cox and \nFerguson (1991) as a strategy whereby the driver attempts to ignore the stressor most \nfrequently through self-distraction and is associated with reduced attention to the driving task \n(Matthews et al., 1998). The latter three coping styles are maladaptive responses to driver \nstress. Machin and Hoare (2008) showed the importance of ineffective coping on negative \noutcomes with maladaptive strategies of Confrontive and Avoidance Coping explained some \nof the relationship between bus driver workload, negative affect and physical symptoms. \n \nBoth the DSI and DCQ were developed on commuter drivers and do not take into \naccount the specific risks of driving a bus for work. Developing an instrument to measure bus \ndriver behaviour based on the DSI and DCQ foundation may be a useful tool for bus \ncompanies when assessing safety intervention effectiveness, monitoring driver behaviour \nover time as part of a risk management programme, or in the selection, recruitment and \ntraining of bus drivers.  Such an instrument can be used to identify the behavioural responses \n5 \nthat can increase the risk of bus crashes and\/or lead to poor health outcomes through \nineffective coping strategies.  \n \nResearch to develop a self-report measure of bus driver behaviour began by \nunderstanding whether the original DSI component structure could be replicated for a bus \ndriving sample. A slightly modified version of the DSI was administered to 543 UK bus \ndrivers and an exploratory Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was performed (Garwood \nand Dorn, 2003). The results indicated minor differences between the component structure \nfor commuter drivers and bus drivers for both the DSI and the DCQ. For the DSI, all five \ncomponents were replicated with the exception being that Thrill Seeking and Dislike of \nDriving were reversed in their loadings but retained the original items. The DCQ also \nindicated considerable overlap with all five original components being replicated. The study \nconfirmed the robustness of the original DSI and DCQ component structure in defining bus \ndriver behaviour.  Garwood and Dorn (2003) point out that even though the component \nstructure for the DSI and DCQ had been replicated for bus drivers, there were likely to be \nmany issues pertinent to the demands of bus driving not currently included in either \ninstrument.  \n \nBus driving can be differentiated from commuter driving in several ways; bus driving is \npaced to a strict schedule; requires frequent stopping and starting; involves interaction with \nthe general public and mostly takes place in busy built-up areas. However, there are also \nsimilarities in responses to traffic independent of the work context given that most drivers, \nprofessional or otherwise, report some element of vulnerability to driver stress (\u00d6z et al., \n2009). Building on their work, Dorn and Garwood (2005) conducted in-depth interviews with \nbus drivers to generate items relevant to bus driving which formed the basis of a pilot \n6 \nquestionnaire for Study 1.  The pilot questionnaire, incorporating new items and relevant \nitems from the DSI and DCQ PCA, was distributed to a representative sample of bus drivers \nworking for a major UK bus company for Study 1 described here.  \n \n There is reason to suppose that coping strategies may be related to driving behaviour \nunder time pressure, but the role of coping on bus driving behaviour has not been studied \nhitherto. Coping appears to play an important role in mediating behavioural change \n(McDonald and Davey, 1996). Considering ineffective coping strategies that are likely to be \nassociated with undesirable outcomes, previous research has found that high Emotion-focus \nas a coping strategy leads to attentional impairment and seems to reduce risk-taking through \nheightening awareness of mistakes. Confrontive Coping, on the other hand, aims to relieve \nfrustration through intimidating behaviours such as gesturing at other drivers, tailgating, and \nrisky overtaking. Finally, Avoidance Coping may be related to behavioural changes in \ndriving as bus drivers attempt to ignore the stressor through self-distraction and may reduce \ntheir attention to driving safely.  \n \nFor the present paper, Study 1 reports on two PCAs (bus driver version of the DSI and \nbus driver version of the DCQ) that are envisaged as resulting in an instrument that defines \nthe behavioural and emotional factors that are characteristic of bus driving referred to \nhereafter as the Bus Driver Risk Index (BDRI). The methodology for the development of the \nBDRI scales described in Study 1 is in line with the development of the original DSI and \nDCQ (Matthews et al., 1997). Study 2 was concerned with a test-retest reliability of the BDRI \nscales (in a sub-sample) then the predictive power of the BDRI for bus crashes was assessed \nfor validation purposes. For Study 3, the scales were correlated against repeated \nmeasurements of drivers\u201f celeration behaviour (a term used to define a variable measuring \n7 \noverall speed change; af W\u00e5hlberg, 2008a) in a bus driving simulator to validate the BDRI \ncoping scales against an objective measure of driving performance. Of special importance is \nhow time pressure to maintain a schedule impacts on behavioural outcomes and coping \nresponses and whether these behaviours and coping strategies are associated with bus \ncrashes. \n   \n \nSTUDY 1: PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSES OF THE PILOT \nQUESTIONNAIRE \nMETHOD \nParticipants \nA sample of 315 bus drivers (297 males and 18 females) recruited from a major UK bus \ncompany and aged between 19 and 71 (mean age = 46.3, SD = 10.3) volunteered to complete \nthe pilot questionnaire.  An opportunity sampling approach was taken. Drivers who were \navailable to participate were included. Length of service ranged from 0-39 years (mean length \nof service = 9.0. SD = 9.0). \n \nMaterials and Procedure \nThe pilot questionnaire consisted of three sections:  Section 1 covered background and \ndemographic information.  Section 2 covered bus driver emotional response relating to traffic \nevents and situations, including 45 items from the original DSI (Garwood and Dorn., 2003) \nand 60 items constructed from bus driver interviews (Dorn and Garwood., 2005). Participants \nresponded to an 11-point scale ranging from 'never' to 'always'.  Section 3 included 32 items \n8 \nfrom the DCQ (Garwood and Dorn, 2003) responded to using a 6-point scale from 'never' to \n'always'.  In section 3, participants were instructed to answer on the basis of how they usually \ndeal with driving a bus when it is difficult, stressful or upsetting.  The pilot questionnaire was \ndistributed to several bus depots across the UK via the depot manager with the support of the \ntrade union. Ethics approval was obtained from Cranfield University\u201fs ethics committee and \nbus drivers were informed of their ethical rights in an accompanying letter. The letter also \nexplained the purpose of the research and the trade union support. A stamped addressed \nenvelope was also provided for the questionnaire to be returned to Cranfield University to \nensure the bus company could not identify individual responses. Bus drivers completed the \nquestionnaires either during their breaks or at home. \n \nTreatment of Results  \nThere is considerable disagreement surrounding the minimum sample requirements for a \nPCA. DeWinter et al (2009) showed that sample size depends on level of communality (the \nportion of the variance that is accounted for by common factors), loadings, number of \nvariables per factor and the number of factors (Mundfrom et al., 2005: Gagn\u00e9 and Hancock, \n2006; MacCallum et al., 1999; Marsh et al., 1998; Velicer and Fava, 1998). The size of the \nsample in the present study is classified as satisfactory according to the guidelines provided \nby Comrey and Lee (1992) as samples of 300 or more produce robust factor analyses, with \nminimal differences emerging as the sample size increases. \n \n  The pilot questionnaire was analysed using separate PCAs for both bus driver behaviour \nand bus driver coping. Each scale was analysed for internal consistency and item \ndiscrimination analysis was carried out and confirmed the robustness of the scales. The use of \na PCA to determine the component structure is consistent with the procedure used in the \n9 \ndevelopment of the forerunner to the DSI \u2013 the Driver Behaviour Inventory (DBI: Glendon et \nal., 1993) and the Driver Stress Inventory (DSI: Matthews et al., 1997), the PCA exploring \nindividual differences in driver stress vulnerability in a Japanese sample (Matthews et al., \n1999), as well as other variants for particular professional driver groups. The commercial \nname for these variants is the \u201eDriver Risk Index\u201f offered via Cranfield University\u201fs company \ncalled DriverMetrics for assessment and educational purposes. Variants include the Police \nDriver Risk Index (Gandolfi and Dorn, 2005; Gandolfi, 2007) and the Fleet Driver Risk \nIndex (Dorn and Gandolfi, 2007). \n \n An oblique rotation was used for the PCA, consistent with the development of the DSI \nand DCQ, as there is a theoretical basis for the assumption that the factors will be quite \nhighly correlated.  Creation of a simple structure solution (incorporating the removal of items \nwhich load onto more than one component) is deemed preferable, in order to create a set of \ncomponents consisting of pure variables each of which load onto only one component \n(Tabachnick and Fidell, 1996 p.587).   \n \nRESULTS \nA PCA for Section 2 items of the pilot questionnaire was conducted and 75 items remained \nonce items loading on multiple components were removed.  Components with eigenvalues \ngreater than 1.5 were extracted and rotated using the Direct Oblimin rotation. This provided a \nsix-component solution based on a scree plot and explained 35.49% of the variance. Items \nexceeding a loading of 0.3 were used with no cross-loadings.  The PCA was re-run after the \nremoval of the items, and inter-item and item-total correlations calculated.   \n \n10 \nComponents that were largely replicated from the original scales retain their component \nnames but new components also emerged and were named based on their interpretation.  The \nalpha coefficient for each of the six final components is shown in Table 1, second column \nand range from .70 to .92 and within the recommended level of .70 (Nunnally, 1978). \n \nTables 1 and 2 about here \n \n Table 2 shows the final items and the origin of the item for the principal loadings on the \nsix components, in the rotated component matrix. Component One is labelled Fatigue \nProneness as it includes seven of the original eight DSI Fatigue Proneness items and the \nremaining five items relate to how the bus driver feels when they have been driving for a long \nperiod without a break. Component Two is labelled Hazard Monitoring as seven of the fifteen \nitems were from the original DSI and the remaining eight items relate to making quick \ndecisions, planning ahead, looking ahead and bus driver confidence. Component Three is \ncalled Relaxed Driving as the items relate to being relaxed at work, relaxing after work, being \nhappy and cheerful and not taking things personally. Component Four is labelled Patient \nDriving as the items pertain to being patient, not driving angry and not feeling frustrated or \nannoyed with other road users. Component Five is called Anxious Driving, with four of the \nsix items being from the DSI Dislike of Driving component.  Component Six is labelled \nThrill Seeking as five of the items were originally from the DSI Thrill Seeking component \nand the other two related to bus driving-specific thrill seeking behaviours such as the \ntendency to seek an adrenaline rush. \n \nWhen the PCA was run for a second time after removal of items, the factor structure was \nlargely replicated, explaining 45.78% of the variance.  The only major differences were that \n11 \nthe item \u201cIt is important to be considerate to passengers and other drivers\u201d moved from the \nHazard Monitoring factor to the Thrill Seeking factor, on which it achieved an insufficient \nitem-total correlation (0.07) and was removed, and the item \u201cWhen I have to stick to a \ntimetable I feel under pressure even if I know that I can do the job in the time allowed\u201d, \noriginally from the Patient Driving factor, failed to load onto any factor in the second PCA \nand was also removed. \n \nAn exploratory PCA of the 32 items was also conducted for Section 3 of the pilot \nquestionnaire pertaining to bus driver coping strategies. Components with eigenvalues greater \nthan 1.5 were extracted based on a scree plot and rotated using the Direct Oblimin rotation.  \nItems exceeding a loading of 0.3 were used with no cross-loadings. Table 3 shows examples \nof the principal loadings on the five components.  The solution explained 56.2% of the \nvariance.  As before, components that were largely replicated from the original scales retain \ntheir component names but new components also emerged and were named based on their \ninterpretation. \n \nTable 3 about here \n \n For the selection of items, those exceeding a loading of 0.3 were used, with no cross-\nloadings in order to achieve a clean and easily interpretable solution that could be scored in a \nstraightforward manner. Component interpretability was also an extraction criterion. \nComponent One is labelled Evaluative Coping with the component being made up of items \nthat previously loaded onto the DCQ\u201fs Reappraisal and Task Focus Coping components. The \nnine items relate to changing behaviour, gaining something worthwhile from the drive and \nlearning how to cope with stress. Component Two is labelled Emotion Focus Coping with all \n12 \nseven of the DCQ\u201fs Emotion Focus Coping items and describes the tendency to self-blame if \na mistake is made. Component Three is labelled Risky Coping, relating to taking risks and \nnot changing behaviour when faced with difficult situations. Component Four is named \nAntagonistic Coping, measuring coping when getting angry with other drivers, swearing, \nflashing the lights and using the horn. Component Five is labelled Avoidance Coping with \nfive of the original seven items from the DCQ\u201fs Avoidance component and describes the \ntendency to employ self-distraction strategies when the demands of driving a bus are \nperceived as exceeding the capacity to cope.  \n \nWhen the PCA was run a second time after the items had been removed, the factor structure \nremained quite stable.  The only key difference was that the Risky Coping factor did not \nretain any items that were exclusive to the construct therefore in the interests of retaining \nsimple structure, the factor was removed. \n  \nThe results of both PCAs enabled 53 items to be discarded from the pilot questionnaire and \nrelevant items only were retained for the final BDRI incorporating measures of both bus \ndriver behaviour and coping.  The inter-item and item-total correlations were calculated and \ncomfortably exceeded the recommended cut-off of 0.3 (Hair et al., 1998).  It should be noted \nthat unless a cross validation study is conducted it cannot be determined whether the same \nfactor structure would re-appear given similar data.  The full BDRI including Section 1 \ncovering situational risk questions such as bus driving experience and crash involvement is \navailable from the authors for research purposes. The BDRI was then administered to a fresh \nsample of bus drivers for Study 2 and 3. \n \n \n13 \nSTUDY 2: BDRI RELIABILITY AND VALIDATION USING COMPANY \nBUS CRASH INVOLVEMENT \n \nMETHOD \n \nParticipants, questionnaire and procedure \nFor Study 2, a total sample of 557 bus drivers (519 males and 38 females, with no overlap \nwith Study 1 participants) employed by a major UK bus company and aged between 19 and \n71 (mean age = 46.5, SD = 10.4) completed the BDRI under the same procedure as described \nin Study 1.  Length of service ranged from 0-39 years (mean = 8.9, SD = 9.1). An opportunity \nsampling approach was taken. Drivers who were available to participate (and who had not \npreviously participated in study 1) were included. Of these 557 drivers, a sub sample of 131 \ndrivers completed the BDRI again if they gave their permission to be contacted on the back \nof the BDRI.  The second BDRI was completed between two and three months later to assess \ntest-retest reliability.  \n \nBus Crashes \nBus crash data for each driver were supplied by the bus company and obtained from the \ncompany's database of incidents that occurred throughout the UK over a 40 month period just \nprior to completing the BDRI. Drivers not working for this whole period where excluded. An \nincident is defined as all incidents resulting in damage or injury, including collisions with \nother vehicles, objects or pedestrians as well as passenger falls inside the bus. Bus drivers \nmust report all incidents. Culpability for incidents is determined by the driver's manager and \nan insurance team, considering information such as the driver's incident report, photographs \nand witness reports. Three types of culpability are used for the present analyses; none, some \n14 \nand sole\n1.  The driver\u201fs crash record is therefore represented by three variables; number of \n\u201eAll crashes\u201f, \u201eAll responsible crashes\u201f, and \u201eSolely responsible crashes\u201f. The sample had a \nrange of 0-14 All crashes (mean 2.9, SD 2.7), 0-12 All responsible crashes (mean 1.3, SD \n1.5) and 0-9 Solely responsible crashes (mean 1.2, SD 1.4). Mileage data was not collected \nfor each driver, but to set the crash risk in context, the average mileage for a 5 day rota for \nbus drivers working for the bus company is 630 miles per week. \n \n \nStatistical methods \nThe main research question here was whether the BDRI scales were associated with bus \ndriver crash records. The most informative measure to answer this question is the amount of \nexplained variance, which implies a correlation and\/or multiple regression needs to be \nperformed on the data. Usually, these methods are not suitable for crash data, due to the \nlatter\u201fs skewed distribution in low-risk, short time period samples. The present data, however, \nwas not so skewed (only nineteen percent of the drivers had no crashes) and made a logistic \nregression approach feasible. Also, the Pearson correlation is very robust, showing no \ntendency to being affected by distributions that are more skewed than those of the variables \nused in the present study (af W\u00e5hlberg and Dorn, 2009). \n \nAs a simple complementary method, t-tests were run between drivers with and without \ncrashes. This type of analysis is not sensitive to non-linear effects, which could in principle \n                                                     \n1\n This choice was based upon the theoretical view that only incidents that are due to the bus drivers\u201f behaviour \ncan be predicted by variables such as the BDRI scales, while those that are not caused by the drivers in the \nsample are error variance. This view has been tested and supported (af W\u00e5hlberg, 2008b; 2009; af W\u00e5hlberg & \nDorn, 2007). However, the judgement of culpability remains a problem. For the company that supplied the data, \nit has been shown that their criterion is somewhat too lenient, with about 10-20 percent of incidents being \nmislabelled as non-culpable (af W\u00e5hlberg & Dorn, 2007). \n15 \nbe present, although this has rarely been shown in individual differences in traffic safety \nresearch. \n \n In traffic safety research, it is often found that basic demographic variables such as sex, \nage and experience have some associations with risk. To further test the usefulness of the \nBDRI components, a control for such variables was needed to show whether the scales had \nany predictive power. \n \n Therefore, the present study used several different methods of differing refinement and \npower; Pearson correlations and independent-samples t-tests for the zero-order relations, and \npartial correlations to hold various demographic variables constant.  \n \nRESULTS \nFirstly, test-retest correlations for all the BDRI components were calculated for those drivers \nwho completed the instrument twice (see Table 1) and the components were found to have \ngood to moderate reliability properties with r ranging from .68 to .86. All components were \nreasonably normally distributed. \n \nNext, Pearson correlations were run between the three crash variables and the twelve \nBDRI components and the results can be seen in Table 4. Thereafter, independent t-tests, \nusing \u201enone\u201f versus \u201esome\u201f crashes as a grouping variable, were calculated with the number \nof crashes as a predictor of differences in group means for the BDRI components. It was \nfound that Hazard Monitoring was significantly correlated with all three crash variables and \nthat t-tests discriminated between those with and without crashes for this component.  \n \n16 \nTable 4 about here \n \nNext, demographic variables were tested for associations with crashes; sex, age, years \nof employment and years since gaining a Passenger Carrying Vehicle (PCV). Out of these \nfifteen correlations, only three were significant at p<.05 (N=528), with PCV license versus \nfull blame incidents being the strongest at r=-.102. It would therefore seem that there is little \ninfluence of these variables on accidents in the present data. \n \nPartial correlations were run between the BDRI components and crashes, controlling \nfor age and number of years since gaining a PCV licence. The results of this analysis were \nvery similar to the previous correlations; very slight increases in correlations were observed \nfor Fatigue Proneness, Hazard Monitoring and Evaluative Coping.  \n \n \nSTUDY 3: ASSOCIATIONS WITH DRIVER CELERATION \nBEHAVIOUR IN A SIMULATOR \n \nINTRODUCTION \nTo further validate the BDRI, a bus simulator was used to gather driving behaviour data \nunder standardized circumstances, a very different source of data as compared with crashes. \nThe problem with using a driving simulator is the wide choice of outcome parameters. The \nchoice should include variables that are strongly related to individual differences in traffic \nsafety if the BDRI can be said to be a valid measure of bus driver behaviour and risk. \n \n17 \n There is no generally accepted way of measuring driver behaviour in a simulator. The \nmost commonly used variables are speed, braking, lateral movement and lane position (see \nfor example Matthews et al., 1992; Emo et al., 2004), but there are few studies investigating \ntheir basic psychometric properties, such as reliability, and association with on-road \nperformance (e.g. Godley et al., 2002; Lee, Cameron and Lee, 2003), and even less published \nevidence of their validity in terms of predicting actual road safety (Edwards et al., 1977; Cox \net al., 1999; Deery and Fildes, 1999; Szlyk et al., 2002; Lee, Lee, Cameron and Li-Tsang, \n2003; Szlyk et al., 2005). These studies have tested a wide array of variables, with little \noverlap between studies and small effects found, and there is therefore no good evidence that \nany type of simulator driving variable can predict crash record (af W\u00e5hlberg, 2009). \n \n The variable of driver celeration\n2\n behaviour (a measure of speed changes during \nmovement of the vehicle) has been predicted to be the strongest possible predictor of \nindividual differences in crashes (af W\u00e5hlberg, 2008a). It has acceptable reliability (af \nW\u00e5hlberg, 2003; 2004), and has been tested as a crash predictor with some success (af \nW\u00e5hlberg, 2007a; 2007c), with a predictive power that increase strongly when data are \naggregated (af W\u00e5hlberg, 2007b), i.e. longer measurements of driving and\/or several \nmeasurements per driver are used.  \n  \n Furthermore, it has been shown to be superior to various speed measures (mean, \nmaximum, standard deviation) and other acceleration variables (af W\u00e5hlberg, 2006a; 2006b). \nEven more important, driving behaviour as measured by celeration correlated between \ndifferent situations, when bus driving en route and when driving with an instructor. The \n                                                     \n2\n This term has been coined to denote measurements made according to the theory and methodology specified in \naf W\u00e5hlberg (2008). In contrast to the physical measures of acceleration and deceleration, it therefore carries a \ncertain theoretical meaning. \n18 \nstrength of the association was similar to that found between different measurements en route \n(af W\u00e5hlberg and Melin, 2008). This is important when simulator-based variables are used, as \nsuch measurements can often be questioned regarding their ecological validity. \n \nOne of the interesting features of the celeration variable is that it is relatively weakly \ninfluenced by the amount of traffic and passengers, i.e. celeration is largely determined by \ndriver\u201fs disposition, not by the amount of congestion (af W\u00e5hlberg, 2003; 2007c) despite the \nfact that bus drivers are often late during rush hour. i.e. are under time pressure, something \nthat could be expected to influence their behaviour. However, this effect has been measured \nas a correlation between celeration behaviour and number of vehicles passing and passengers, \nfor different drivers. The size of the effect as a difference within drivers has not been \nestimated. This means that even though the individual disposition is the strongest determinant \nof individual differences in celeration behaviour, there could be a sizeable difference in \nbehaviour due to time pressure, if this effect is similarly strong for all drivers.  \n \nFor the present study, the simulator procedure involved repeated drives, with one drive \nunder time pressure (see further information in the method section) and the analysis set out to \ninvestigate whether celeration behaviour changed under this condition and whether the BDRI \ncomponents were associated with this change. Behaviour under a time pressured drive is of \ninterest because bus drivers are often behind on their time schedule, a situation that might \ninduce them to mobilise ineffective coping strategies (as measured by the BDRI) and drive at \nrisk to try to catch up (while their mean speed is actually lower than when they are not behind \nschedule in actual driving \u2013 see af W\u00e5hlberg, 1997). If this especially risky response could be \npredicted from the BDRI coping components, it may prove useful for educational purposes to \nassist bus drivers in the use of more effective coping strategies to reduce the risk of being \ninvolved in a crash.  \n19 \n \nFor validation purposes, the main focus for Study 3 was therefore to determine whether \nthe BDRI coping components could predict driving performance on a bus simulator under \nnormal driving and under a stressful time pressured drive. Furthermore, an investigation of \nwhether celeration behaviour in a simulator has similar psychometric characteristics as in real \ndriving regarding reliability, i.e. a strong increase in between measurements correlations \nwhen data are aggregated into longer periods of time, was undertaken. This is important for \nbetter decisions about how long simulator-based driving assessments should be and \nsomething that does not seem to have been studied hitherto. \n \nMETHOD \nSample \nThe drivers used as participants for this study were newly recruited and had not yet started \noperational driving. Therefore, there was no overlap of participants that took part in Study 1 \nand 2. Before taking part in the study, all drivers completed the standard three weeks of in-\nvehicle training at the bus company\u201fs driving school and were about to take their PCV \ndriving test. Seventy-one trainee bus drivers with a mean age of 36.0 years (SD = 8.3 years) \nwere tested on three simulator drives.  Eighty seven percent of the participants were male and \n13% female.  Participants had held a full UK car driving licence for a mean of 14.9 years (sd \n= 8.1 years).  Their mean celeration in the first half or the first drive was 0.260 meters per  \nsecond squared (SD = 0.074 meters per second squared).  In their first three months as a bus \ndriver (post-training) they were involved in a mean of 0.63 collisions (sd = 0.85), although \none participant was not included in the collision analysis. \n \nProcedure \n20 \nThe BDRI was sent to bus depot managers to hand out to bus drivers using the same \nprocedure as described in Study 1. On the back of the questionnaire drivers were asked to \nvolunteer to take part in the simulator component. If they provided their details, the drivers \nwere contacted individually and allocated a time to undertake the simulator study. All \nparticipants then sat the simulator component between 1 week and 1 month of completing the \nquestionnaire. Participants were required to drive a fixed base bus simulator with a mock up \nbus cab in the centre of 180\u00ba curved screen, six metres in diameter and 2.75 metres high. \nPerformance measures were captured every tenth of a second. Participants were required to \ntake part in an orientation drive for about 10 minutes followed by a scenario with multiple \nexposures to a high rate of hazardous and time critical encounters with traffic, pedestrians, \njunctions, varying road configurations and traffic control devices (signs and markings). Bus \ndrivers were also asked to stop at the bus stops to \u201ecollect passengers\u201f and then move off \nfrom the bus stop when it was safe to do so. This scenario took about 15 minutes to complete. \nParticipants were then asked to drive the same route, but this time informed that they were \nrunning late on the schedule and that they needed to complete the run as soon as possible. \nParticipants took approximately 10 minutes to complete the timed drive. \n \nCalculations \nThe theoretically specified celeration parameter when measured can be approximated in \nseveral ways, for example by using only longitudinal acceleration values. In the present \nstudy, no approximation was needed, due to the sensitivity of the equipment, and the \nceleration values used were therefore the mean of all absolute acceleration values for the \nspecified route (see next paragraph) for each driver (this measurement method and \ncalculation is specified in af W\u00e5hlberg, 2008a). Celeration for a driver is computed as the \nmean of all speed changes of the vehicle on the stretch of road, when the vehicle is moving \n21 \n(v>0). Whether the measurement is undertaken in one or several dimensions (lateral, \nlongitudinal and other) does not matter, because all data are amalgamated into one variable to \ndescribe net speed change.  \n \nFor the present study, each of the three drives in the simulator was divided in half (by \ndistance), yielding six variables. These variables were used to calculate the reliability for \nsimulator celeration behaviour over time to investigate whether this behaviour changes under \ntime pressure conditions, and how this parameter might relate to components of the BDRI. \n \n \nRESULTS \nCeleration behaviour reliability and time pressure effects \nFirst, it was investigated how the stability of celeration behaviour changed with increased \naggregation of data, starting with the mean of each half drive, yielding six variables. It was \nnoted at this stage that there was a strong outlier problem. For each variable, the maximum \nvalue was four or five standard deviations above the mean, while the minimum was two or \nthree times lower. Four cases were therefore excluded, each more than three standard \ndeviations above the mean. These four values tended to be multivariate outliers, and \ndecreased the associations between variables rather strongly. All statistical tests used this \nreduced sample.  \n \nThereafter, all correlations between half drives (distance) were calculated (see Table 5), \nwhich yielded a mean r of .53 (N=15). In the next step of the analysis, the two halves of each \ndrive were averaged, and these values correlated. The results were correlations of .72 (1\/2), \n.58 (1\/3) and .67 (2\/3) (N=67, all p<.001), with a mean of .66. \n22 \n \nTable 5 about here \n \nThereafter, the differences (means 0.20, 0.21 and 0.17 meters per second squared) \nbetween drives were tested, using related samples t-tests. The time pressure drive (drive \nnumber 2) had significantly higher celeration values than the first drive (t=-3.2, p<.01, \nd=0.28) and third (t=-9.5, p<.001, d=0.87) drives, and there was also a difference between the \nfirst and third drives (t=6.6, p<.001, d=0.68)(all N=67, df=66). \n \nCeleration, time pressure and BDRI \nThe differences in celeration behaviour between the time pressure drive and the self-paced \ndrives were calculated. Thereafter, these values, the celeration per drive, and celeration \naveraged over all drives, were correlated with the BDRI coping components and celeration of \ndrives 1 and 3 (to find the association of the difference with the drive that was not used for \nthe difference calculation). These values are shown in Table 6. \n \nTable 6 about here \n \n \nDISCUSSION \nIt can be noted that two of the three maladaptive coping strategies measured by the BDRI \ncoping scale, Emotion Focused and Avoidance coping were associated with a deterioration of \ndriving performance, as measured by celeration, when under time pressure. Avoidance was \nconsistently and significantly associated with celeration across all drives. Also, the \ncorrelations between drives 1 and 3 versus the difference against the time pressure drive \n23 \nindicated that those drivers who tended to drive forcefully to begin with, did this even more \nwhen under time pressure. \nSeveral methodological limitations of Study 3 need to be discussed, apart from the general \nproblem of simulator validity, described in the introduction for this study. It could be argued \nthat the first drive in the simulator should not be included in the analysis, as the drivers were \nlearning how to operate in this new environment. However, the correlations between the half \ndrives were not very different from each other, and quite comparable to those for on-street \nperformance of bus drivers (e.g. af W\u00e5hlberg, 2007b). If the first drive had added a large \nerror component, this should not have been the case.  \nAlso, the time pressure drive may have lacked ecological validity, not only due to the \nsimulator as such, but due to the fact that the drivers may not have experienced any real \nstress, as they knew the situation was not real. The only observation that can be safely \nconcluded was that most drivers (64%) did indeed try to drive faster, as the expected \ndifference on celeration did occur. \n \nGENERAL DISCUSSION \n \nBased on previous research and the results of Study 1, the BDRI contains items pertinent to \ndriving a bus for work and measures the characteristic ways of responding to traffic and \ndriving situations as a bus driver. Study 2 demonstrated that the BDRI contains fair to good \npsychometric properties in terms of coherence and stability over time. Furthermore, some \npredictive capacity concerning crashes seems to be evident. Consistent effects for Hazard \nMonitoring and Evaluative Coping on bus crashes in an expected direction were also found \n(Dorn and Matthews, 1995; Matthews et al., 1998). Previous research on validating the DSI \n24 \nhave used self reported crashes, the present paper investigated the predictive value of the \nBDRI for actual bus crashes. When comparing the present findings to research validating \nother driver behaviour questionnaires such as the Manchester Driver Behaviour \nQuestionnaire (MDBQ; Reason et al., 1990), it should be emphasized that recorded crashes \nhave been used as a criterion rather than self reported ones. When self-reported predictors, \nare used to predict self-reported crashes, the effect tends to be inflated, due to common \nmethod variance (af W\u00e5hlberg, 2009; af W\u00e5hlberg, 2010; af W\u00e5hlberg, Dorn and Kline, in \npress). The MDBQ is the most popular driver behaviour questionnaire in use but has not \nprovided any validation with regards real crashes. So, although the present associations \nbetween the BDRI and real crashes may be weak, validating driver behaviour questionnaires \nin this way is preferable as it avoids the problem of common method variance. \n \nUnfortunately, the use of recorded accidents make the statistical power of the analysis \nweaker, due to low variance, although for bus drivers this is not a severe problem, unless very \nshort time periods are used. Also, the validity of recorded crash data is often questioned. \nAgain, this is less of a problem when working with bus drivers and companies that keep \nacceptable records, as compared to crash data from police sources, where strong under-\nreporting is known. \n \nPrevious research on professional drivers has found that Task Focus (on which the new \nEvaluative Coping component uncovered here is based) and Hazard Monitoring are \npredictive of components of simulated driving performance such as efficient responses to \nhazards (Dorn, 2005). Increased scores on Hazard Monitoring and Evaluative Coping are \nassociated with active attempts to anticipate danger by using more efficient visual search \nstrategies whilst driving (Dorn, 2005) and the associations found between these components \n25 \nfor a bus driver sample and bus crash involvement suggests an adaptive response in line with \nthe transactional theory of driver stress (Matthews, 2002). Increased vigilance to hazards \nleads to safer decision-making in driving (Crundall and Underwood, 1998; Crundall, et al., \n2003) and in turn, appears to be associated with lower risk of being involved in a bus crash as \nreported in Study 2. However, Hazard Monitoring was not related to celeration behaviour in \nlaboratory-based Study 3. Also, the link between laboratory celeration behaviour and real \nroad celeration behaviour has not been found which weakens the value of the present results. \nThis does not negate the value of training hazard monitoring skills perhaps by using video-\nbased traffic simulations as a method to improve a bus company\u201fs safety record (Isler et al., \n2009). \n \nSleep-related problems and similar variables have also been found to be associated with \ntraffic incidents (Dalziel and Job, 1997; Maycock, 1997; Hanowski et al., 2003; Taylor and \nDorn, 2005; see McDonald, 1989 for a review) and the link reported here between Fatigue \nProneness and bus crashes can be explained with reference to this research. However, Fatigue \nProneness was not associated with all the crash variables. This may be because the scale does \nnot tap all aspects of bus driver fatigue. A comparative study of different sleep and tiredness-\nrelated scales would be required to develop this scale further. \n \nThe lack of significant associations between the remaining BDRI components and crash \nrecord may be due to the fact that behavioural precursors to collisions are multifaceted and \ndependent upon rather specific individual differences in the emotional responses to traffic. \nAnother major consideration, of course, is that exposure was not controlled for in the \nanalyses and further research on the link between the BDRI components and crash \ninvolvement would need to take into account the number of hours spent driving. Although, \n26 \npersonality-based emotional reactions to bus driving are unlikely to explain all the variance in \nbus crashes (Matthews et al., 1991) this does not negate the value of the BDRI for \nunderstanding general behavioural responses, especially for educational purposes.  This is \nexemplified in the findings for Study 3. Here, the results showed that the Avoidance Coping \ncomponent was significantly associated with celeration in a bus simulator but Avoidance was \nnot found to be related to crashes in Study 2 perhaps because simulated driving is a more \nsensitive measure than are crashes of driver behaviours. As Avoidance coping is associated \nwith attempts to ignore the stressor through self-distraction, one possible interpretation of this \nfinding is that under time pressure, avoidance strategies may serve to distract bus driver \nattention resulting in a greater incidence of forceful speed changing behaviours (af W\u00e5hlberg, \n2008a).  The findings for Emotion Focus Coping on the other hand, suggest that increased \nself-blame as a coping strategy leads to poor attention to the task with more erratic use of \nspeed rather than increased risk taking. However, it is likely that different driving task \nconditions will generate different patterns of associations between the simulator parameters \nand the BDRI components. For example, a scenario containing an unpredictable and \nannoying road user preventing bus drivers from making progress on their route is likely \ngenerate responses related to Confrontive Coping. Further research would need to establish \nthe different driving task conditions under which the BDRI components predict bus driving \nbehaviour.  \n \nThe present findings support Machin and Hoare\u201fs (2008) conclusion that maladaptive \ncoping strategies are associated with negative outcomes amongst bus drivers and lend further \nsupport for previous research on the transactional theory of driver stress and its application to \nprofessional drivers (\u00d6z et al., 2009; Kontogiannis, 2006; Dorn, 2005). As predicted by the \ntheory, maladaptive coping responses to the stress of bus driving impact on driver behaviour.  \n27 \nImportantly, we demonstrate that celeration can be reliably measured in a simulator using \nrather short time periods. This is true even if the excluded outliers are included; there is still a \nstrong increase in reliability with increased driving time and\/or occasions.  \n \nThe implications are that simulator-based celeration measurement might be particularly \nrelevant for professional driver behaviour assessment for training and selection purposes, as it \nis probably highly related to actual on-road celeration behaviour (af W\u00e5hlberg, 2003) which \nprevious research shows is associated with crashes. As celeration behaviour is indicative of \nsafety, the present results suggest that a simulator can be used to assess a newly recruited bus \ndriver for operational driving. What is lacking in terms of evidence for this chain of reasoning \nis a direct link between celeration behaviour in a simulator and on the road celeration \nbehaviour.  \n \nPractical Applications \n \nThe results for the timed drive condition suggest that Avoidance Coping is a strategy \nthat can be detected by the BDRI, whereupon this can be used to target drivers that may be \nmore prone to greater levels of speed change in response to time pressure for educational \npurposes. Poor scores on Hazard Monitoring, Evaluative Coping and Fatigue Proneness \nmight also identify those bus drivers in need of training.  \n \nRegardless of the predictive power of the various components of the BDRI, what it \ndoes provide is a summary of the facets of bus driver behaviour, organizing these otherwise \nrather fragmented components of reactions and actions into more understandable wholes. The \nvalue of this instrument would be especially useful for identifying and raising awareness of \npersonal tendencies when driving for work. Using the scores on the instrument, certain \nbehaviours can be targeted for training for individual drivers, identifying areas where he or \n28 \nshe differs from the norm. The BDRI is currently being used by bus companies to enable \nsafer behavioural strategies to be embedded using Cranfield trained driver coaches. Bus \ndrivers are given individualised BDRI profile feedback to develop personal goals to avoid the \ndevelopment of risky behavioural and psychological responses to time pressure. A more \neffective strategy for dealing with driving a bus on a strict schedule can be coached. The \npresent data also suggest there are implications with regards to scheduling by bus companies \ngiven that time pressure and congestion in built up areas appear to interact with individual \ndifferences. Unrealistic scheduling placing demands on bus drivers may increase the financial \ncost of crashes for organisations.   \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank the employees of the bus company for their contributions to this paper, Jenny \nStannard for the simulator data collection and the bus company for access to crash data.
