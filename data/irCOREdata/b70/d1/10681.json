METHODS: 20 male subjects underwent 56-days of bed-rest and were assigned to either an inactive control, or a countermeasure group which performed high-load resistive exercises (including squats, heel raises and toe raises) with whole-body vibration. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lower-limbs was performed at two-weekly intervals. Volume of individual muscles was calculated. RESULTS: Countermeasure exercise reduced atrophy in the triceps surae and the vastii muscles (F>3.0, p<.025). Atrophy of the peroneals, tibialis posterior and toe flexors was less in the countermeasure-subjects, though statistical evidence for this was weak (F<or=2.3, p>or=.071). Atrophy in the hamstring muscles was similar in both groups (F<1.1, p>.38). The adductor longus, sartiorius and rectus femoris muscles showed little loss of muscle volume during bed-rest (F<1.7, p>.15).

The role of the\nlower-limb musculature, particularly with regard to the plan-\ntarflexors and knee and hip extensors\n1-3, in upright posture and\nlocomotion imply that the maintenance of these muscle systems\nduring long-duration spaceflight, an environment where such\nfunctions are not required, would be critical. Prolonged bed-rest\nis a frequently used ground-based methodology to simulate the\neffects of spaceflight on the human musculoskeletal system\n4.\nBasic principles of exercise physiology suggest that low load en-\ndurance exercise is inappropriate to maintain muscle mass during\nprolonged bed-rest and that higher load resistance exercise is re-\nquired\n5. Indeed, bed-rest studies implementing aerobic counter-\nmeasures\n6,7 or low-load exercise\n8 have found that they were\nineffective for the maintenance of the lower-limb musculature,\nwhereas bed-rest studies implementing resistive exercise were\nmuch more successful, though the effect on particular muscle\ngroups depended upon the types of exercise performed\n9-14.\nMore recently, whole body vibration during resistive exer-\ncise has received attention in sport science as a method to pro-\nvide an additional stimulus during training\n15. It is thought that\nthe vibratory inputs stimulate additional muscle activity during\ncontraction\n16 via the muscle spindle system\n17-19, to produce a\ngreater force of muscle contraction\n20, and hence stimulus for\nmuscle maintenance and\/or hypertrophy. Vibratory stimuli, ap-\nplied at the feet are transmitted up to the hip and lumbar spine\n21\nand hence can potentially modulate muscle activity throughout\nthe entire lower quadrant. We hypothesized that high-load re-\nsistive exercise with whole body vibration could be an effec-\ntive countermeasure against muscle atrophy in the lower-limbs\nduring prolonged bed-rest.\nJ Musculoskelet Neuronal Interact 2009; 9(4):225-235\nResistive vibration exercise reduces \nlower limb muscle atrophy during 56-day bed-rest\nD.L.

Methods: 20 male subjects underwent 56-days of bed-rest and were\nassigned to either an inactive control, or a countermeasure group which performed high-load resistive exercises (including squats,\nheel raises and toe raises) with whole-body vibration. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lower-limbs was performed at two-\nweekly intervals. Volume of individual muscles was calculated. Results: Countermeasure exercise reduced atrophy in the triceps\nsurae and the vastii muscles (F>3.0, p<.025). Atrophy of the peroneals, tibialis posterior and toe flexors was less in the counter-\nmeasure-subjects, though statistical evidence for this was weak (F\u22642.3, p\u2265.071). Atrophy in the hamstring muscles was similar\nin both groups (F<1.1, p>.38). The adductor longus, sartiorius and rectus femoris muscles showed little loss of muscle volume\nduring bed-rest (F<1.7, p>.15). Conclusions: The countermeasure exercise programme was effective in reducing atrophy in the\nextensors of the knee and ankle but not the hamstrings. \nKeywords: Spaceflight, Berlin Bed Rest Study, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Microgravity, Countermeasures\nOriginal Article Hylonome\nDieter Felsenberg and J\u00f6rn Rittweger are acting as consultants to the\nEuropean Space Agency and Novotec Medical for the exploitation of\nthis study\u2019s results.

Belav\u00fd et al.: Resistive vibration exercise in bed-rest\n226\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a commonly used\nmethodology to assess muscle size. In studies where subject\nnumbers are limited, such as bed-rest, measures of muscle at-\nrophy during bed-rest and response to countermeasures are\nbest performed using measures of muscle volume, thus avoid-\ning greater imprecision associated with taking single cross-\nsectional area measures\n22,23. In the current work, we wished to\nexamine the effectiveness of resistive exercise with whole\nbody vibration during prolonged bed-rest on changes in muscle\nvolume in the lower-limbs as measured with MRI.\nMaterials and methods\nBed-rest protocol\nThe \u201cBerlin Bed-Rest Study\u201d was undertaken at the Charit\u00e9\nCampus Benjamin Franklin Hospital in Berlin, Germany, from\nFebruary 2003 to June 2005. Twenty medically and psycho-\nlogically healthy male subjects underwent 8-weeks of strict\nbed-rest. The sample size of the Berlin Bed-Rest Study was\nbased on power analyses of expected distal tibia bone density\nchanges, rather than muscle measures. It is reasonable to ex-\npect, however, that muscle is more susceptible to\ninactivity\/training, and other works have shown strongly sig-\nnificant findings, including the effect of countermeasure exer-\ncise, in sample sizes half than that in the current study\n12. The\nbed-rest protocol, as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria,\nis discussed in detail elsewhere\n24. In brief, however, subjects\nwere randomly allocated to either an inactive control group\n(CTRL) or a group that underwent a whole body resistive vi-\nbration exercise countermeasure programme (RVE group)\nusing the Galileo Space exercise device (Novotec Medical,\nPforzheim, Germany). The mean (SD) baseline age, height and\nweight of the RVE group were: 32.6(4.8) years, 183(9) cm and\n81.7(14.4) kg respectively and in the CTRL group: 33.4(6.6)\nyears, 185(7) cm and 79.4(9.7) kg.\nHorizontal bed-rest was employed, though subjects were per-\nmitted to be positioned in up to thirty degrees head-up tilt for\nrecreational activities during daylight hours (such as watching\ntelevision). Subjects performed all hygiene in the supine position\nand were discouraged from moving excessively or unnecessar-\nily. Force sensors placed in the bed supports, 24-hour nursing\ncare and video surveillance permitted monitoring of subjects\u2019\nactivities. The institutional ethics committee approved this study\nand subjects gave their informed written consent. Subjects were\naware that their participation in the study was voluntary and that\nthey were permitted to withdraw from the study at any time.\nCountermeasure exercise\nResistive vibration exercise (RVE) was performed using a\ndedicated prototype (Galileo Space) of a commercially available\nvibration platform (Novotec Medical, Pforzheim, Germany).\nThe exercise device permitted exercise in the supine position\nthroughout bed rest. The exercise regime targeted the lower leg\nmuscle groups with resistive loading and neuromuscular stimuli\nvia whole-body vibration applied at the feet\n25,26. The counter-\nmeasure exercise protocol is described in detail elsewhere\n24. In\nbrief, the subjects were placed in a supine position (Figure 1),\nwith their feet resting on the vibration platform and an applied\nvibration amplitude between 3.5-4 mm. An axial force between\n1.0 and 1.8 times body weight was placed through the subjects\u2019\ntrunk and spine via elastic shoulder straps (targeted to be ap-\nproximately 75-85% of the subject\u2019s 1-repetition maximum).\nWith the exception of Sundays and Wednesday afternoons, two\nexercise sessions per day, of 30 min duration (between 4-6 min\npure exercise time) were performed. A total of 89 exercise ses-\nsions were scheduled for each subject.\nFigure 1. Resistive vibration exercise during bed-rest. Subjects were required to perform lower-limb exercises against a resistive force transmitted\nvia belts at the waist and shoulders and via hand-grips. The feet were placed on a suspended platform. Vibratory stimuli in the lower-limbs\nwere generated by rotation of the platform around a vertically oriented axis.D.L. Belav\u00fd et al.: Resistive vibration exercise in bed-rest\n227\nTrained staff supervised all training sessions, and subjects\nwere given feedback and encouragement. For each morning\nsession, four resistive exercises were performed once in the\nfollowing order:\n\u2022 squats: knees were straightened from 90\u00b0 to full extension in\ncycles of 6 s for 60 s whilst the vibration frequency was set\nto 18 Hz in the first training sessions and progressed in sub-\nsequent sessions up to a maximum of 24 Hz.\n\u2022 heel raises: in almost full knee extension, the heels were\nraised into plantar flexion as long as the subjects could sus-\ntain this (up to 40 seconds). The vibration frequency was re-\ntained at 26 Hz.\n\u2022 toe raises: with knees in full extension, the forefoot was\nraised into dorsiflexion up to 40 seconds. The vibration fre-\nquency was retained at 26 Hz.\n\u2022 explosive kicks: 10 explosive pushes from a flexed knee and\nhip position against the vibrating platform were performed.\nThese \u201ckicks\u201d were targeted at generating peak forces to\nstimulate bone formation\n27 rather than muscle per se.\nIn the afternoon session, subjects were asked to exercise\nwith a lower resting platform reaction force (60-80% of the\nvalue achieved in the morning). Only one exercise was per-\nformed and subjects kept their feet on the platform with their\nknees in a nearly extended position and performed no move-\nment. Vibration frequency was retained at 19 Hz and the exer-\ncise performed between 4 and 6 minutes (depending on the\nphysical ability of subject).\nMRI protocol\nBaseline MR scanning was conducted on the first day of\nbed-rest (BR1) and then at two week intervals (BR14, BR28,\nBR42 and BR56) through to the end of the bed-rest period.\nSubjects were positioned on the scanning bed in supine with\ntheir knees and hips supported in slight flexion by a pillow\nunder the knees. Transverse MR images were acquired from\nthe lower-limbs using a 1.5 Tesla Magnetom Vision system\n(Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Typically, 35 images of the\nthigh (from the superior aspect of the head of femur to the knee\njoint line; thickness=10 mm, inter-slice distance=5 mm,\nTR=6000 ms, TE=15 ms, FA=180 degrees, field of view: 480\nx 480 mm interpolated to 512 x 512 pixels) and 30 images of\nthe lower leg (knee joint line to the distal most portion of the\nlateral malleolus; thickness=10 mm; inter-slice distance=5\nmm, TR=4800 ms, TE=15 ms, FA=180 degrees, field of view:\n340 x 340 mm interpolated to 512 x 512 pixels) were acquired,\nthough for taller subjects, additional images were added to en-\nsure the region of interest was captured. Images were stored\nfor offline analysis.\nImage measurements\nOne operator (TM) performed all image measurements. To\nensure operator blinding to study time-point and subject group,\neach image was assigned a random number (www.random.org).\nImageJ (Ver. 1.38x, http:\/\/rsb.info.nih.gov\/ij\/) was used for MR\nimage analysis. The cross sectional area (CSA) of the following\nmuscles in the thigh (Figure 2) was measured in each image:\nrectus femoris (RF), vastii (V; vastus medialis, lateralis and in-\ntermedius), sartorius (SART), gracilis (GRAC), adductor mag-\nnus (AM), adductor longus (AL), biceps femoris long head\n(BFL), biceps femoris short head (BFS), semitendinosus\n(SEMI_T) and semimembranosus (SEMI_M). Whilst AM and\nAL could be readily differentiated from adductor brevis, this ad-\nductor muscle could not easily be differentiated from pectineus\nand hence was not measured. In the lower leg (Figure 3) the fol-\nlowing muscles were measured: gastrocnemius lateralis\nFigure 2. Thigh muscle image measurements. Example images from\nthe upper (left) and lower (right) thigh. Thirty-five images were ac-\nquired from the superior aspect of the femoral head to the knee joint\nline. The cross-sectional area (when present) of the muscles rectus\nfemoris (RF), vastii (V), sartorius (SART), gracilis (GRAC), adductor\nmagnus (AM), adductor longus (AL), biceps femoris long head\n(BFL), biceps femoris short head (BFS), semitendinosus (SEMI_T)\nand semimembranosus (SEMI_M) were measured in each image.\nFigure 3.Lower leg muscle image measurements. Example images from\nthe upper (left) and lower (right) calf. Thirty images were acquired from\nthe knee joint line to the lateral malleolus. The cross-sectional area (when\npresent) of the muscles gastrocnemius lateralis (GLAT), gastrocnemius\nmedialis (GMED), soleus with flexor hallucis longus (SOL), tibialis pos-\nterior (TIBP), flexor digitorum longus (FDL), peroneals (PER; peroneus\nlongus, brevis and tertius), anterior tibial (ANT; tibialis anterior, extensor\ndigitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus) were measured in each image.D.L. Belav\u00fd et al.: Resistive vibration exercise in bed-rest\n228\n(GLAT), gastrocnemius medialis (GMED), soleus with flexor\nhallucis longus (SOL; due to a lack of consistent anatomical\nlandmarks (e.g. fascia) on MRI, soleus was difficult to separate\nfrom flexor hallucis longus in a number of subjects. The results\nof the current study do not change when soleus is considered\nseparately from flexor hallucis longus, thus the data presented\nis pooled from both muscles), tibialis posterior (TIBP), flexor\ndigitorum longus (FDL), peroneal group (PER; peroneus\nlongus, brevis and tertius), anterior tibial muscles (ANT; tibialis\nanterior, extensor digitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus).\nDue to experiments conducted during bed-rest on the right\nlower-limb\n28,29, all image measurements were performed on the\nleft lower-limb only. 33,073 individual manual CSA measure-\nments comprised the final data set, requiring approximately 830\nperson-hours of image analysis. To enable assessment of\nchanges in entire muscle volume, individual CSA measurements\nfor each muscle were interpolated given an image thickness of\n1.0 cm and inter-image distance 0.5 cm. The resulting muscle\nvolume data was used in further analyses.\nData processing and statistical analyses\nLinear mixed-effects models\n30 were used for each muscle,\nto fit fixed-effects for study-date, training-group and a study-\ndate\u00d7training-group interaction. Baseline subject age, height\nand weight were included in the model as linear covariates.\nRandom effects for each subject were permitted. Where nec-\nessary, allowances were made for heterogeneity of variance\n(such as due to training-group and\/or study-date). Subsequent\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) examined the significance of\neach of the factors and the interaction term. An \u03b1 of 0.05 was\ntaken for statistical significance. Where significant effects\nwere seen, subsequent post-hoc analyses determined which\nstudy-days differed from baseline (BDC). As multiple imaging\nsessions were undertaken on the same subjects, we looked for\nconsistent significant differences across time points. All analy-\nses were performed in the \u201cR\u201d statistical environment (version\n2.4.1, www.r-project.org). \nResults\nDue to issues such as movement artefacts or scanner failure,\ndata sets were not available for analysis for all subjects from\nevery scanning session. Table 1 lists the number of data sets\navailable for analysis in the current work. No differences ex-\nisted in baseline muscle volume between the groups at baseline\nscanning (BR1) for any of the muscles (Fall<2.73, pall >0.12).\nTables 2, 3 and 4 show, respectively, the baseline (BR1) volume\nof each muscle group in the lower leg and thigh.\nEffect of resistive vibration exercise countermeasure \u2013 \nlower leg musculature\nFor ease of interpretation, changes in muscle volume during bed-\nrest in the lower leg muscles are expressed as percentage change\ncompared to baseline in Table 2 from BR14 and beyond. ANOVA\nshowed very strong effects for changes in volume in all muscles of\nthe lower leg over the course of the study (study-date: F4,63all \u22653.8,\np all \u2264.0075). Very strong statistical evidence for an effect of the\ncountermeasure exercise on muscle volume were seen in the gas-\ntrocnemius medialis (group: F1,14=5.9, p=.029, group\u00d7study-date:\nF4,63=6.3, p=.0003) and soleus muscles (group: F1,14=1.5, p=.24,\ngroup\u00d7study-date: F4,63=5.9, p=.0004), with the RVE group show-\ning preservation of soleus muscle volume up to the BR42 scanning\nsession with some losses thereafter. Losses in gastrocnemius me-\ndialis muscle volume in the RVE group also occurred later (BR28\nand beyond) than in the CTRL group but to a lesser extent. A mod-\nerate statistical effect (group: F1,14=8.3, p=.012, group\u00d7study-date:\nF4,63=3.0, p=.0247) was also seen in the gastrocnemius lateralis for\nan influence of the countermeasure on muscle volume, with no sig-\nnificant changes in muscle volume in the RVE group over the\ncourse of the study, but with significant losses in the CTRL group.\nIn the peroneal (group: F1,14=0.9, p=.35, group\u00d7study-date:\nF4,63=1.1, p=.36) and tibialis posterior (group: F1,14=0.5, p=.49,\ngroup\u00d7study-date: F4,63=2.3, p=.071) muscle groups, little or\nno evidence existed in ANOVA for an effect of the countermea-\nsure exercise. Inspection of the data in Table 2 shows, however,\nsignificant losses of volume in both muscles in the CTRL\ngroup, but no significant losses of muscle volume in tibialis\nposterior in the RVE group. The peroneal muscles showed a\nmuch later (BR56 in the RVE group as compared to BR28 in\nthe CTRL group) appearance of statistically significant muscle\nvolume loss. Evidently, a greater number of subjects would be\nneeded to more precisely examine the extent of effectiveness\nof the countermeasure in these two muscle groups.\nIn the anterior tibial muscles, no evidence (group: F1,14=0.3,\np=.60, group\u00d7study-date: F4,63=0.6, p=.66) existed for an influence\nof the countermeasure, despite a decrease in muscle volume, with\nloss of muscle marginally greater in the RVE group. The toe flexor,\nflexor digitorum longus also showed little evidence of a different\nresponse in the RVE group (group: F1,14=2.0, p=.18, group\u00d7study-\ndate: F4,63=1.8, p=.13), though some loss in muscle volume oc-\ncurred in the CTRL group by the end of bed-rest, with no significant\nchange in the RVE group. The RVE group showed a marginal in-\ncrease in muscle volume early in bed-rest (BR14) and subsequently\nno losses in muscle volume with respect to baseline thereafter.\nStudy- Lower leg musculature Thigh musculature\ndate CTRL RVE CTRL RVE\nBR1 8a 9b 6a,b 9c\nBR14 10 8b 10 9b\nBR28 10 8b 9b 10\nBR42 10 8b 10 9b\nBR56 10 9b 10 9b\naTwo data sets missing due to MRI scanner failure\nbScanning performed but data not appropriate for analysis (e.g. move-\nment artefacts)\ncData set missing due to MRI scanner failure\nCTRL: control group; RVE: resistive vibration exercise group.\nBR=day of bed-rest.\nTable 1.

Simi-\nlarly, in the rectus femoris muscle, little evidence existed for\nchanges during bed-rest or an effect of the countermeasure (study-\ndate: F4,62=1.5, p=.22; group: F1,15=.35, p=.56; group\u00d7study-date:\nF4,62=1.4, p=.25), but inspection of the data in Table 4 shows a\nsubtle (but non-significant) decrease in volume of rectus femoris\nin the CTRL group. The RVE group, in contrast, demonstrated\nincreased volume throughout the bed-rest phase, though this was\nstatistically significant only at BR28 and BR42. \nTo facilitate comparison to other studies, we combined mus-\ncles into differing groups (Table 3). All muscle groups (adduc-\ntors, hamstrings, knee flexors, quadriceps femoris) showed\nsignificant changes over the course of the study (study-date:\nF4,62 all >4.9, p all \u2264.0017), with losses in muscle volume in all\nmuscle groups.

Percentage changes in muscle size in the countermeasure group in the current and other studies.D.L. Belav\u00fd et al.: Resistive vibration exercise in bed-rest\n232\nsignificant changes in muscle volume of the lateral gastrocne-\nmius muscle. Additionally, muscle volume of the tibialis pos-\nterior and flexor digitorum longus was stable in the RVE\ngroup, with losses seen in the CTRL group. Reductions in per-\noneal muscle volume occurred later in the RVE group and the\nrectus femoris muscle actually increased in volume in the RVE\ngroup, with no change in the CTRL group. The effects in the\ntibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, peroneal and rectus\nfemoris muscles were, however, statistically weak. Little evi-\ndence existed for an effect of the countermeasure on the four\nmembers of the hamstrings group, adductor magnus and gra-\ncilis, with significant losses in muscle volume occurring in\nboth subject groups. Bed-rest itself had little or no effect on\nthe adductor longus, sartorius and anterior tibial muscles.\nThe strongest effect of the countermeasure on the extensors\nof the ankle and knee attests to the use of squats and heel raise\nexercises - i.e. exercises to target these specific muscle groups.\nIn contrast, the hip extensors (hamstrings and adductor mag-\nnus) were unaffected by the countermeasure, and no exercises\nwere specifically performed for these muscles. In other bed-\nrest and related studies where countermeasure exercise com-\nprised only squat or leg-press exercise (such as on a Cybex\n23\nor Flywheel device\n9,10,31; see Table 5) and the calf muscles were\nnot targeted directly, the retention of calf muscle volume was\nmuch less effective than in works where exercises also targeted\nthis muscle group (such as the current study and in other\nworks\n11,13). In contrast to the current work, Akima and col-\nleagues\n13 showed an effect of their leg-press and plantarflexor\nexercises on reducing hamstrings atrophy in bed-rest. In walk-\ning, the semimembranosus and biceps femoris typically acti-\nvate to decelerate the lower-limb towards the end of the swing\nphase and are also active in initial load-bearing\n1 (i.e. they con-\ntribute to a hip extension moment in a position of hip flexion).\nA squat-type or combined hip-knee extension exercise from a\nmore flexed hip position could activate the different members\nof the hamstring muscles to a greater degree\n32,33, and this may\nbe appropriate modification to countermeasure exercise in bed-\nrest. It should, however, be remembered that the gluteal mus-\ncles are also important extensors of the hip (particularly the\ninferior portion of gluteus maximus such as at heel-strike and\nmid-stance in walking or in stair ascension)\n1. The gluteal mus-\ncles do atrophy in bed-rest\n34, but as yet, no work has consid-\nered the differential effect of bed-rest on the hip extensors (i.e.\ngluteal muscles and hamstrings) and it should also be noted\nthat different rates of atrophy are apparent amongst the four\nmembers of the hamstrings muscle group during bed-rest\n22.\nThus, gaining a deeper understanding the effect of bed-\nrest\/spaceflight on the hip extensors as a whole (and not just\nhamstring muscles) is important for further countermeasure\ndevelopment.\nIt is worthy to note that although the countermeasure group\nshowed a similar volume loss in the anterior tibial muscles,\nthe exercises in the current study targeted at this muscle group\n(toe raises) were conducted against low resistance. Whilst the\naddition of more resistance to the dorsiflexion exercises may\nresult in a greater effect of exercise, this muscle group was\nalso little affected by bed-rest (in the inactive group)\n22 and\ngiven this lesser susceptibility, the priorities of countermeasure\nexercise may be better set at exercises for other, more suscep-\ntible muscles (e.g. hip extensors\n22 or more proximal systems\nsuch as the lumbar extensors\n35,36).\nZange and co-workers\n8 also implemented whole-body vi-\nbration as part of countermeasure exercise for the lower-limb\nmusculature during bed-rest. Compared to the current work,\nafter 14-days of bed-rest their countermeasure subjects exhib-\nited a relatively greater extent of atrophy, in all of the lower-\nlimb muscle groups except the hamstrings (see Table 5). It is\nnoteworthy that the countermeasure by Zange and co-workers\nwas performed in standing with only an addition of 15% of\nbody-weight and no muscle-specific exercises being per-\nformed (i.e. the subjects purely retained their position). It is\nlikely therefore, that this kind of training stimulus was insuf-\nficient for the lower-limb muscles. Interestingly, another work,\nexamining vibration exercise at the lumbar spine using static\nloading at approximately 60% of body-weight found no effect\nof the countermeasure on losses of lumbar extensor muscle\ncross-sectional area during bed-rest\n37. These findings\n8,37 are in\nline with the argument that higher-load muscle specific exer-\ncises are needed if individual muscle size is to be retained. In\nour opinion, whole body vibration during resistive exercise\nmay help to provide an additional stimulus, above that of re-\nsistive exercise alone, for muscle activity and force develop-\nment and retention of muscle mass during bed-rest. It is\nimportant to note that the current study was not intended to\nexamine the extent of any additional benefit of whole-body vi-\nbration on muscle loss during bed-rest per se, but rather to ex-\namine the efficacy of the countermeasure as a whole. Further\nwork is necessary to examine any additive effect of whole-\nbody vibration during resistance exercise.\nDeconditioning during spaceflight is not localised to the\nmusculoskeletal system and a variety of body systems (e.g.\ncardiovascular, vestibular) require countermeasures of their\nown. Aerobic exercise (such as cycling or lower-body negative\npressure) is considered appropriate for the maintenance of the\ncardiovascular system, but such exercise is ineffective in main-\ntaining muscle\n6,7,38 or bone\n39-41. A combination of approaches\nis therefore needed. Astronauts, however, do not have an in-\ndefinite amount of time available for exercises and priorities\nof countermeasure exercise need to be set such that the avail-\nable time is used most effectively. \nIn our opinion, there are four key aspects for countermea-\nsure design to ensure the most effective use of exercise time\nfor preventing muscle atrophy in the lower-limbs: 1) which\nmuscles are indeed affected by bed-rest and\/or spaceflight? 2)\nWhat exercise manoeuvres need to be implemented to target\nthese muscles in the most time effective fashion? 3) What load-\ning levels should be used? 4) What \u201cdose\u201d of exercise (number\nof times per day or week, duration of exercises) is necessary?\nIn the current study, the muscles that were most affected\n(>10% loss of volume at the end of bed-rest in the inactive\ngroup) were all members of triceps surae, the vastii, long head\nbiceps femoris, semitendinsosus, semimembranosus, tibialisD.L. Belav\u00fd et al.: Resistive vibration exercise in bed-rest\n233\nposterior and the peroneals (see also Belav\u00fd and colleagues\n22).\nAn isolated knee extension exercise would be effective for the\nvastii muscles, but this would also stimulate the rectus\nfemoris\n32,33,42, which is much less affected in bed-rest\n22, and\npotentially lead to the development of muscle imbalances.\nModified leg-press exercises (combined hip and knee exten-\nsion), on the other hand, target the vastii, with less activation\nof the rectus femoris\n32,33,42, but also require contribution from\nthe hamstrings and adductor magnus\n32,33,42, thus comprising a\nmore time effective exercise. Calf raises, when appropriately\nperformed, can also be effective in stimulating the peroneal\nand tibialis posterior muscles groups\n43, though care needs to\nbe taken in exercise selection for calf raises as knee position\ncan markedly modify the contribution of the gastrocnemius\nand soleus muscles\n44. Controlling the posture of the arch of the\nfoot appears to be an important factor for optimal activation\nof the tibialis posterior muscle\n44,45, and this should also be in-\ncorporated into exercise. Exercises to target the muscles of the\nhip and lumbar spine should also be considered\n34,35,37,46,47.\nFurthermore, based upon the results of the current and prior\nwork, it appears that high (between 75-85% of a person\u2019s 1-rep-\netition maximum) loading levels\n9-14 during exercise are better at\nmaintaining muscular mass and function than low-load or en-\ndurance exercise\n6-8. This does not imply that low-load exercise\nhas no role to play in countermeasure exercise programmes for\nmaintenance of muscle in bed-rest\/spaceflight. In the current\nwork, rectus femoris muscle volume increased whilst vastii vol-\nume decreased in the countermeasure exercise group. This could\nimply the development of muscle imbalance due to exercise.\nSome subjects did report the development of knee pain during\ntraining\n24, which could imply innapropraite loading and\/or mus-\ncle activation. One particular benefit of including low-load ex-\nercises could be to ensure that the individual can perform the\nexercises using the correct technique and optimal\/appropriate\nbody posture prior to progressing the exercises to a higher-load.\nThis may help to avoid the development of muscle imbalances\ndue to inappropriate movement\/loading patterns. However, fu-\nture work will have to consider this in more detail.\nFinally, the frequency (per day or per week) with which ex-\nercise countermeasures should be performed during bed-rest\/\nspaceflight is a topic which still requires further study. Works\nby Alkner and Tesch\n9,10 have shown that resistive exercise on a\nrelatively infrequent schedule (every three days) is capable of\nreducing lower-limb muscle atrophy during bed-rest (Table 5).\nFurther research on exercise dose during bed-rest could provide\nvaluable information to optimise the efficiency of countermea-\nsure exercises.\nIt should be noted that in the current work we considered\nonly muscle size when evaluating the effectiveness of the\ncountermeasure exercises. Other aspects of muscle function,\nsuch as muscle activation, proprioception and postural control\nwere not evaluated. Whilst it may be possible to argue that\nchanges in muscle size do correlate with changes in muscle\nforce production capacity\n28,48, other aspects of muscle function,\nparticularly postural control, are dependent upon integration\nof information from a number of systems (e.g. vestibular, pro-\nprioceptive, visual)\n49 which may need to be addressed using\nadditional countermeasures. \nIn conclusion, we examined the effect of a resistive vibra-\ntion exercise countermeasure comprised of squats, heel raises\nand toe raises during 56-days of bed-rest on muscle volume\nloss in the lower-limbs. We found the countermeasure to be\nmost effective in reducing or preventing atrophy in the three\nheads of triceps surae and the vastii muscles. Conversely, the\ncountermeasure was comparatively ineffective for the ham-\nstring and thigh adductor muscles. Countermeasure design\nneeds to consider which muscular systems are most affected\nby bed-rest and also ensure that other body systems (e.g. car-\ndiovascular) are trained. Further work is necessary to evaluate\nthe optimal exercise \u201cdose\u201d (per day \/ per week) for a time-\nand cost-effective intervention. \nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank the subjects who participated in the study, the\nstaff of ward 18A at the Charit\u00e9 Campus Benjamin Franklin Hospital, Berlin,\nGermany and Boris Calakic, Petra Helbig, Christian Kainz and Gerhard\nWolynski of the MR scanning centre for their 2 year involvement.
