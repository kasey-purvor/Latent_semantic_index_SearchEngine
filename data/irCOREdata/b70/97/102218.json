Participants were randomised to receive placebo \nGH and placebo T (P), GH and placebo T (GH), T and placebo GH (T) or GH and T (GHT). \n \nInterventions:  Leucine rate of appearance (Ra, index of proteolysis), non-oxidative leucine disposal Rd \n(NOLD, an index of protein synthesis) and leucine oxidation rate were measured with an infusion of L- [1-\n13C] leucine. Muscle biopsies for the measurement of gene expression, body composition and aerobic \ncapacity (VO2max). \n \nResults: Serum IGF-I levels increased significantly with GH and GHT (p<0.001) compared to placebo. T \nincreased significantly only in the T group (P=0.028). Leucine Ra and NOLD increased with GH (P=0.015, \nP=0.019) and GHT (P=0.017, P=0.02) but leucine oxidation did not change significantly in any treatment \ngroup. Mid thigh muscle mass and VO2max increased (P<0.04) with GHT only.  Expression of muscle \nfunction genes did not change significantly but the within group comparisons revealed a significant \nincrease of androgen receptor expression in the GHT group (P=0.001).  \n \nConclusion: This study showed that 6 months treatment with low dose GH alone or with T in healthy \nelderly men produces comparable increments in whole body protein turnover and protein synthesis. \n \n250 words \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3\nIntroduction \n \nSarcopenia, an involuntary loss of muscle mass and strength, is a well recognised feature of normal \nageing. The mechanism for this is probably multifactorial but may be due in part to age-related hormonal \nchanges (1).  \n \nNormal aging in men is marked by decreases in both GH and testosterone (T) secretion. The 24 h GH \nproduction rate decreases by approximately 14 % per decade of adult life after puberty (2).  Serum T \nlevels begin to decline in the late 3rd decade and then decrease progressively throughout adult life (3). \nBoth GH and T are strong anabolic agents, which promote nitrogen retention and increase lean body \nmass (LBM) and protein metabolism in growth hormone deficient (GHD) and hypogonadal men \nrespectively (4, 5).  It has been suggested that the changes in body composition in older subjects may be \nrelated to the age related decrease in GH and T.  \n \nIn healthy elderly men the rate of muscle protein synthesis and myosin heavy-chain synthesis has been \nshown to correlate positively with IGF-I and T levels (6, 7). In elderly women, GH administration of 0.025 \nmg rhGH\/kg\/d for 1 month was shown to increase whole body protein synthesis and breakdown and to \nincrease muscle protein synthesis (8). In healthy elderly men however GH administration for 3 months \nincreased muscle mass and strength but failed to affect whole body protein metabolism or muscle protein \nsynthesis (9). Near-physiological T treatment for 6 months has been shown to increase LBM and strength \nand reduce muscle protein breakdown in older men (10) whereas low dose testosterone treatment for two \nyears in elderly men with low testosterone has shown no beneficial effect on muscle mass and strength  \nsuggesting a dose-dependent effect (11).  Both GH and T elicit their effect on protein synthesis by binding \nto their receptors and increasing muscle gene transcription, including that of IGF-I (10,12). There is some \nevidence that intramuscular IGF-I rather that of the systemic circulation is of major importance for the \nanabolic action of GH (13). There may therefore be a synergistic effect between the anabolic action of GH \nand T as the administration of T in elderly men increased skeletal muscle IGF-I mRNA and up regulated \nandrogen receptor (10).  \n \n 4\nWe have investigated the effect of near physiological growth hormone GH and\/or T on whole body protein \nturnover in healthy elderly men with relatively low circulating IGF-I and T levels.  Low-dose GH \nreplacement was tailored individually the aim being to reverse some of the aging-associated changes \nwithout significant adverse effects. In order to investigate a possible effect of treatment on skeletal muscle \ngene expression, biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5\nSubjects and Methods \nParticipants \nTwenty-four community dwelling elderly men (65 -75 years old) who were healthy and independent, were \nrandomised to receive either (i) placebo GH and placebo T (Pl), (ii) recombinant human GH (rhGH) and \nplacebo T (GH), (iii) T and placebo rhGH (T) or (iv) rhGH and T (GHT) for six months in a double-blind \ntrial. Hospital pharmacists not otherwise involved in the study, randomised participants into treatments \nusing computer-generated pre-allocated study numbers. These subjects were a subgroup of a larger \nstudy of 80 subjects. The effect of the different hormone treatments on LBM, fat body mass (FBM), mid-\nthigh muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), muscle strength , aerobic capacity (VO2max),and quality of life \nhas been published previously (14). Exclusion criteria were: Any clinically significant disease, body mass \nindex (BMI) > 30 kg\/m2, evidence of active malignancy, any history of pituitary disease or prostate cancer \nand elevated age-specific levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) or a palpable prostate nodule. From \nvolunteers meeting these criteria whose circulating IGF-I levels were lower than the 50th percentile for the \nlocal age-specific reference range (145ng\/mL), we selected eighty subjects with the lowest testosterone \nlevels but excluding those with frank testosterone deficiency (< 173ng\/dl: 6.0 nmol\/L). The mean \nscreening T level of our study participants was 397.6\u00b110ng\/dL. Twenty four volunteered to participate in \nthe isotope study. The Research Ethics Committee of Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Hospitals approved the \nprotocol and subjects gave informed written consent. \n \nStudy Protocol \nThe study was a double blind, randomised and placebo-controlled trial. At baseline  participants gave \nfasting morning blood samples for IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor binding proteins 1 and 3 (IGFBP-1 and \nIGFBP-3), Testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), PSA, glucose, insulin and C-peptide. We \nencountered a problem measuring the insulin levels at the end of the study in two of the subjects in the \nGH group and they were excluded from the analysis.  The same day subjects underwent body \ncomposition analysis using dual emission x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA; Hologic QDR-4500W scanner, \nWaltham USA) and mid-thigh muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements by computed \ntomography CT (Philips -Tomoscan AV). VO2max was measured using a step-wise maximal exercise test \non an electromagnetically braked bicycle ergonometer (Lode Excalibur Sport, Groningen, Netherlands) as \ndescribed  (14). Strength was measured in the afternoon of the same day isometrically on handgrip and \n 6\non the right knee. Right knee (concentric flexion\/extension at angular velocities of 60\u00b0\u00b7sec-1, 90\u00b0\u00b7sec-1 and \n180\u00b0\u00b7sec-1) were also performed using a Kin - Com model 125E (Chattecx, Chattanooga,TN). Peak torque \nwas calculated using Kin-Com computer software.  \nA second appointment was made less than a week from the initial assessment and participants were \nasked to present in the metabolic research area of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Day Center at \nSt.Thomas\u2019 Hospital, at 0800 h after an overnight fast. Subjects were instructed not to exercise for 3 days \nprior to this appointment. A priming dose of sodium [13C] bicarbonate (0.2 mg\/kg; mass trace) and [1-13C] \nleucine (Tracer Technologies, Somerville, MA, 15 mg\/ml, 13C enrichment 99%) was administered followed \nby a constant infusion of [1-13C] leucine (1 mg\/kg.h-1) for 9 h.  \nBlood samples were obtained 5min before, at baseline and at 180,240,360, 480 and 540min to measure \nthe isotopic enrichment and concentration of \u03b1 -ketoisocaproic acid (KIC). Expired air was collected at the \nsame  time points using a GaSampler Breath Collection System (Quintron Instrument Co., Inc., \nMilwaukee, WI,) for the measurement of 13CO2 enrichment. At baseline and at 2, 5 and 8h after the start \nof the infusion the subject\u2019s CO2 production, and oxygen consumption were measured by indirect \ncalorimetry (CPX-D, Medical Graphics, Minneapolis,MN).  \nAt the end of the study a percutaneous muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis was performed under local \nanaesthesia for the measurement of important skeletal muscle gene expression. The study was repeated \nat 6 months. At visit 1, (week 0 of the treatment period), within two weeks of baseline assessment, \nparticipants were trained to self-administer their treatment, which commenced that day and continued \ndaily for six months.  \n \nDosage and hormone administration \nTestosterone or placebo was given by transdermal patches in a standard dose of 5mg\/day. Dosage and \nadministration protocol of Human recombinant GH (rhGH) or placebo started at a low fixed dose \n(0.1mg\/day) and the dose increased at each study visit until a prearranged target IGF-I levels was \nreached. The rhGH dose was reduced if the IGF-I level was above the 100th percentile of the age specific \nreference range (250ng\/mL) and there were likely side-effects or if it was above the 75th percentile of the \nyoung adult range 380ng\/mL. Compliance was monitored by counting the empty vials and used patches \nwhich had to be returned to our nurse specialist. \n \n 7\nAnalytical methods \nUsing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (5971A MSD, Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) and \nselected ion monitoring, \u03b1KIC enrichment was measured as the quinoxalinol-trimethylsilyl derivative at \nm\/z 232 and 233 (15)  [within-assay coefficient of variation (CV)  <2%]. 13C enrichment of breath CO2 was \nmeasured on a VG SIRA series II isotope ratio mass spectrometer (VG Isotech, Cheshire, UK; within-\nassay CV, <1%).  \nTotal testosterone was measured on the Bayer ADVIA Centaur analyser by a competitive immunoassay \nusing direct chemiluminescent technology. The intra-assay coefficient of variation was 6.2% and the inter-\nassay coefficient of variation was 4.4% at 95.5ng\/dL, 4.7% and 4.7% at 365.4ng\/dL, 2.6%and 4.3% at \n798.3ng\/dL and 2.3% and 4.3% at 1009.5ng\/dL. The sensitivity and assay range was 10-1500ng\/dL \n(0.35-52.1nmol\/L).  Free Testosterone (FT) was calculated from the formula: FT (pmol\/L) = 6.11-[2.38x \nlog (SHBG nmol\/L)] x testosterone result x 10. IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3 were measured using coated tube \nimmunoradiometric assay kits, DSL 7800 and DSL 6600 respectively (DSL UK Ltd, Oxon, UK). The intra-\nassay CV was 1.8% at 82.7 ng\/ml and 3.9% at 7.3 ng\/ml. The inter-assay CV was 1.9% at 76.9 ng\/ml and \n0.6% at 8.03 ng\/ml. The intra-assay CV for IGFBP-1 was 5.2% at 5.2 ng\/ml and 2.7% at 144.6 ng\/mL. \nThe inter-assay CV was 3.5% at 5.16 ng\/mL, and 3.6% at 142.03 ng\/ml.  Insulin and C peptide were \nmeasured by double antibody RIA within-assay CV, 6% and 9%, respectively. Glucose was determined \nby an oxygen rate method employing a Beckman Oxygen electrode with within-assay CV of 2%.  \n  \n \nCalculations \nThe kinetics of leucine metabolism were calculated using standard isotope dilution equations for steady \nstate conditions. KIC enrichment was used as a measure of intracellular leucine enrichment (16). Leucine \noxidation rate was calculated from the enrichment of CO2 and the CO2 production rate assuming 80% \nrecovery of 13CO2 (17). Rd (rate of disappearance) was assumed to equal Ra, since subjects were \nstudied in steady state. The non-oxidative leucine disappearance rate (NOLD; a measure of protein \nsynthesis) was calculated as the difference between leucine Rd and leucine oxidation rate. Leucine \nkinetics were expressed as \u00b5mol\/kg body weight\/min. \n \nMuscle biopsy \n Muscle biopsies were performed at the end of the study. The vastus lateralis was anaesthetised locally \nusing lignocaine. A 150mg-tissue sample was removed using a Bergstrom needle and was immediately \nfrozen in liquid nitrogen.  \n 8\n \nMuscle mRNA  \nA real-time quantitative PCR system (PE Biosystems Prism 7700, Foster City, CA) was used to measure \nthe abundance of selected mRNAs in muscle tissue. Transcripts quantified were myosin heavy chain type \n1 (MHC I), MHC IIa, MHC IIx, IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP5, PPAR gamma, androgen receptor and GLUT4,and \nthe mitochondrial mRNAs cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 (COX3), and COX4 (18 ) . RNA was extracted \nfrom skeletal muscle of individual subjects by the Trizol method (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD), \ntreated with DNase (Life Technologies) and then reverse-transcribed using the TaqMan Reverse \nTranscription Reagents (PE Biosystems). \n \nStatistical Analyses \nBaseline differences between groups were analysed by one-way analysis of variance, employing the \nBonferroni correction factor. Changes in outcome measures after 6months of hormone treatment between \ngroups were analysed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for the value of the dependent \nvariable at baseline and treatment group. Analysis of covariance was also used for within group \ncomparisons.  Linear regression analysis was used to assess relationships between variables. P values < \n0.05 were considered significant. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SE. Data were analysed using \nStataTM 6.0 computer programme, (Stata Corporation, Texas USA).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9\nResults  \n \nSubjects characteristics \n \nThree of the twenty four subjects who volunteered to participate in the measurement of leucine kinetics \ndid not complete the study. Subjects were well matched in terms of anthropometric and hormonal data. \nBaseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Subject characteristics, body composition and hormone \nlevels in the total study group and this subgroup have been reported previously (14, 17).  \n \nHormone profile (Table 2). \nTestosterone levels increased significantly only in T group (P=0.02), but did not change in GHT group. \nIGF-I levels increased significantly with administration of GH alone (p<0.001) and GHT (p<0.0001) when \ncompared to placebo. IGFBP-3 also increased significantly after GHT (p<0.03) and with a trend towards a \nsignificant increase in the GH group (P=0.07). There were no significant changes in plasma insulin or \nglucose levels in any treatment group. \n \nWhole Body Protein Kinetics (WBPK) (Fig 1, Table 3) \nLeucine Ra and NOLD, increased significantly by 16 + 5.9 % (P=0.015) and by 17.1+ 6.5% (P=0.019) \nafter 6m of GH administration respectively. Similarly leucine Ra and NOLD increased significantly by 15.5 \n+ 5.9% (P=0.017) and by 16.7+6.5% (P=0.021) respectively in the GHT group. There was no change in \nleucine Ra or NOLD in the T group. Leucine oxidation rate did not change significantly in any treatment \ngroup compared to placebo. T administration had no effect on leucine Ra or NOLD.  \n  \nA positive correlation was also found between leucine NOLD and LBM (r=0.47, P<0.0001). At the end of \nthe treatment period, changes in IGF-I levels were directly related to changes in leucine Ra (r=0.19, \nP=0.04) and leucine NOLD (r=0.4, P=0.002).     \n \nBody composition & middle thigh cross sectional area (CSA) (Table 4) \nAlthough a trend of increasing LBM was observed after GH (1.4 \u00b1 3.4kg) and after GHT (1.3\u00b13 Kg) this \ndid not reach statistical significance (P=0.35) Total fat mass (TFM) decreased by 3.6\u00b15.9 Kg (P=0.015) \nonly with GHT. The mid thigh muscle area as assessed by CT scan increased significantly by 7% \n(P=0.05) only after GHT. \n 10\n \nAerobic capacity (VO max) & Muscle strength  2\nVO max increased significantly (P=0.038) compared to placebo only after GHT administration (table 4). \nNo significant changes were recorded in any treatment group in either isokinetic or isometric strength \nmeasurements (data not shown). \n2\n \nMuscle gene transcript levels (Table 5) \nThere were no changes in skeletal muscle gene expression for MHC I, MHC IIa, MHC IIx, IGF-I, IGF-II, \nIGFBP5, PPAR gamma, and GLUT4, or the mitochondrial mRNAs COX3 and COX4. The only significant \nchange was in androgen receptor levels (AR), which increased significantly after GHT in a within group \ncomparison (P=0.04). \n \n \nAdverse events \n \nMild joint stiffness and muscular pain attributed to GH administration and skin irritation and nipple \ntenderness attributed to T administration, were observed with the same frequency as reported previously \n(14). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 11\nDiscussion  \n \nThe current study demonstrated that near physiological dose co-administration of GH and T and of GH \nalone for 6 months in healthy elderly men, increased both leucine appearance rate from protein \nbreakdown and non-oxidative leucine disposal, a measure of protein synthesis.  These results represent \nthe first demonstration of GH and T on an important physiological measurement affecting body protein \nstore. \n \nThere is controversy as to whether whole body protein synthesis (WBPS) rate declines with ageing (6, \n19). In one report older adults, WBPS expressed in terms of body weight was lower than in young adults \nwhen however, the data were normalised to LBM no difference was found (20). A recent study in 78 \nsubjects across the adult age span demonstrated that the rates of WB protein turnover and protein \nsynthesis declined with ageing with no age-effect on amino acid oxidation, even after adjustment for LBM \n(21). The differences between these studies may reflect study conditions and methodologies used.  \n \nAdministration of GH to GHD patients for 1- 8 weeks has been shown to result in a greater increase in \nwhole body protein synthesis than proteolysis due to an inhibition of leucine oxidation resulting in an \nimprovement in protein balance (4, 22, 23).  This improvement in protein balance can account for the \nincrease in LBM reported with GH treatment (4, 24). Similarly in young healthy subjects a high dose of \nGH (67 \u03bcg.kg-1.day-1 for 4 weeks) increased protein synthesis and protein breakdown with a decrease in \nleucine oxidation and improvement in protein balance (25). In elderly men GH treatment for 16 weeks \ncombined with resistance exercise increased WBPK with no effect in oxidation (26).  The finding in the \ncurrent study of increased protein synthesis and proteolysis with no effect on oxidation with GH treatment \nsuggests a new steady state has been reached with an increase in protein turnover. In the short term GH \nwould be expected to have a greater effect on protein synthesis than on proteolysis resulting in an \nincrease in LBM. The subjects in this study were a subgroup of a larger study of 80 subjects.  Although \nthe increase in LBM with GH alone or GH and T was not significant in the subgroup, in the total group a \nsignificant increase in LBM was found (14). A reduction in both protein turnover and synthesis in elderly \npeople represents a reduced capacity to remodel tissues (20). The current study shows that GH \nenhances the remodeling process in older people.  \n \n 12\nIn our study physiological doses of T administered transcutaneously failed to produce any significant \nchanges in protein turnover. Testosterone administration at a high unphysiologic dose (bi-weekly \ninjections of 3mg\/kg) for six months has been shown to increase whole body protein synthesis and \ndegradation as well as muscle protein synthesis with no effect on leucine oxidation in hypogonadal men \n(5).  In addition intramuscular administration of T for six months at a higher dose than used in this study \nhas been shown to increase skeletal muscle protein synthesis in elderly men (10). Failure of T to produce \nany significant changes in our study is most likely due to administration of T via a patch, which results in a \nlower steady (and more physiological) T concentration than weekly (or bi-weekly) intramuscular injections \nthat increases peak T  to supraphysiological levels (10). Huang et al (27) also reported, no changes in \nwhole body protein turnover in a study where T was administered intramuscularly at a much lower dose \n(100mg\/2w) for a six month period in elderly men.   \n \nMauras et. al have shown that co-administration of GH and T to prepubertal GHD boys, markedly \nincreases whole body protein synthesis more than when each compound was given separately (28). GH \nand T are thought to elicit an anabolic effect on skeletal muscle by binding to their respective receptors \nand increasing muscle gene transcription including that of IGF-I (29). The synergistic effect of GH and T \non muscle protein synthesis reported by Mauras et al (28) suggests that GH may augment the effect of T \non mRNA levels of IGF-I and vice versa (30). In the current study combined GH and T had a similar effect \nas GH alone on protein kinetics, although middle thigh (CSA) muscle mass increased significantly only \nafter GH and T. GH and T regulate protein synthesis through different signalling pathways and it is to be \nanticipated that their effects would be additive, if not synergistic. \n \nNo changes were found in our study in IGF-I, IGFBP-5 and AR mRNA levels when compared to placebo. \nThe only significant change was a within group increase of AR after GHT administration.  \nMuscle protein synthesis has been shown to increase by the first week after administration of GH or T \nand this effect to peak by one month. It has been shown that GH and T contribute to muscle protein \naccretion by activating muscle satellite cells possible by increasing intramuscular mRNA of IGF-I (30, 31). \nThus it is reasonable to hypothesize that the increment of muscle mRNA of IGF-I would occur early after \nthe administration of GH or T. Indeed administration of high doses of T intramuscularly in healthy elderly \nmen was found to increase expression of AR at one month but not at six months (10). Of note co \n 13\nadministration of GH and T, the latter in the form of transdermal patch has been shown to increase \nmuscle mRNA of IGF-I after one month of treatment (32). Thus the timing of biopsy in the current study \nmay well be explain the failure to demonstrate an increase in muscle AR and IGF-I mRNA despite an \nincrease in middle thigh CSA. \n \nAn inherent limitation of human studies involving muscle biopsies, is the small numbers prepared to \nundergo the procedure. In the T group only six subjects and in GH, PL and GHT group only five subjects \nunderwent muscle biopsies. Thus it is possible that small changes in muscle gene transcript levels \nevaluated in the current study, persisting even at six months after hormone treatment, could have been \nmissed due to type II error. \n \n \nIn the present study, combined GH and T administration resulted in a significant increase of protein \nsynthesis and proteolysis with no effect on leucine oxidation. To our knowledge the combined effect of \nGH (0.025mg.kg-1 3 times\/w) and T (100mg\/2w im) on WBPK has been investigated by only one previous \nstudy, which reported similar findings (27) apart from the fact that lower and less frequent GH dosage \nalone had no significant effect. These differences  may also be methodological, as in  the study of Huang \net al (27), protein kinetics were measured using plasma leucine enrichment which overestimates the \nintracellular leucine enrichment and may lead to errors in the measurement of leucine kinetics. In the \ncurrent study \u03b1KIC enrichment was used which provides a more robust measure of intracellular leucine \nenrichment. Daily GH may also be more effective than 3 injections a week. \n \nIt has been suggested that the increase in proteolysis observed after GH administration may be due to \nthe effect of GH to increase insulin resistance as insulin has been shown to inhibit proteolysis (33). In our \nstudy the increase in protein degradation, observed after GH and GHT was not associated with increased \ninsulin or C-peptide levels. Thus increased insulin resistance seems an unlikely explanation for this. \n \nThere were no changes in muscle strength in any of the treatment groups in our study in accordance with \nprevious similar studies (34, 35). Myosin heavy chain protein is critical for muscle contractile functions \nand has shown to decline with ageing (6). The same investigators also reported an age-related lowering \n 14\nof the transcript levels of MHCIIa and MHCIIx but not of MHCI mRNA levels and most importantly this \ncould not be reversed by 3m of resistance exercise (36). GH and T treatment had no effect on any MHC \nisoform gene expression in our study.   \n \nMaximal aerobic capacity (VO max)2  increased in the GHT group only.  A decline in VO max2  with ageing \nhas been shown in both cross sectional and longitudinal studies and has been attributed mainly to the \ndecline of muscle mass (37). The latter however, could not entirely explain the decline in VO max2  \nobserved in the elderly as this decline persist even after VO2 max is normalised to muscle mass (38). \nAerobic performance capacity is determined from functional integrity in respiration, circulation and muscle \noxidative capacity. Reduced muscle oxidative capacity has been implicated in the decline of VO max2  \nobserved in the elderly. Indeed   the rates of mitochondrial protein synthesis also decrease with ageing \nand this in turn has been associated with a decline in the expression of cytochrome-c oxidase, subunit II \nand III  (COX-3) and (COX-4) a flux-generating enzyme with a key role in the electron transfer chain in \nmuscle fibres  (38,39). Despite a significant increase in VO2max in our study in the GHT group, no \nchanges were observed in the mitochondria COX-3 and COX-4 gene expression at 6 months. There are \ntwo possible interpretations of this observation. Firstly, as we performed biopsies at a single time point 6 \nmonths after hormone treatment, transient changes of mRNA COX-3 and COX-4 would not be detected. \nIn addition, a central action of GH and T by increasing cardiac performance could not be excluded (40, \n41).  \n \nThere is mounting evidence which suggests that GH exerts its anabolic effect mainly by locally produced \nIGF-I rather than a liver-derived circulating IGF-I (13). Of major importance is the identification of a unique \nlocal IGF-I isoform, known as mechanogrowth factor (MGF), which is specifically expressed in response \nonly to changes in the loading state of skeletal muscles (13,30).  The importance of exercise on muscle \nstrength can be further substantiated from observations that administration of T or GH could not prevent \nthe decline of muscle strength after prolonged bed rest (42). Exercise also increases AR expression and \nthe generalised IGF-I isoform in muscle (13, 30) both of which are further upregulated by the increased \nlevels of GH secreted in response to exercise in normal young adults (43).  The above findings support \nthe role of exercise and hormonal integrity in muscle strength and protein metabolism and may explain \nthe failure of GH or T to increase muscle strength in short tem interventional studies. We might expect \n 15\nthat through the co-administration of GH and T it is possible to increase exercise capacity, which in turn \nimproves (or sustains) physical performance thus preventing the decline of muscle mass and strength.  \n \nIn conclusion administration of GH alone and GHT in healthy elderly, increased whole body protein \nturnover and the latter had the additional benefit of increasing maximum oxygen uptake and thus muscle \naerobic performance capacity. Most likely the beneficial effects of exercise would be made more robust \nby replacing the anabolic hormonal milieu, which is deficient in elderly. Trials looking at the effect of \nhormone administration on specific muscle (myofibrillar, mitochondrial) proteins and more importantly \nlonger-term trials with the power to define surrogate endpoints of frailty such as falls or dependency are \nurgently needed. \n \n 16\nAcknowledgements \n This work was supported by a research fellowship grant (to M.G.G.) from the Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas\u2019 \nHospital Charitable Foundation (now the Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas\u2019 Charity) and by NIH grant RO1 AG \n09531.We thank Derek Knowlden (Novo Nordisk) for providing rhGH and placebo; Norman Mazer \n(Watson Laboratories) for providing Testosterone  and placebo patches; Jill Schimke for skilled technical \nassistance; Richard Savine for assistance with outcome assessments; and Paul Seed and Massoud \nBoroujerdi, for statistical advice.
