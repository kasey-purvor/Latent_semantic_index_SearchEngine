Such accumulation results\nin the formation of the atherosclerotic plaque, which would eventually evolve to complications such as total artery occlusion,\nrupture, calcification, or aneurysm. Although the molecular mechanism responsible for the development of atherosclerosis is\nnot completely understood, it is clear that the immune system plays a key role in the development of the atherosclerotic plaque\nand in its complications. There are multiple antigenic stimuli that have been associated with the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.\nMost of these stimuli come from modified self-molecules such as oxidised low-density lipoproteins (oxLDLs), beta2glycoprotein1\n(\u03b22GP1), lipoprotein a (LP(a)), heat shock proteins (HSPs), and protein components of the extracellular matrix such as collagen\nand fibrinogen in the form of advanced glycation-end (AGE) products. In addition, several foreign antigens including bacteria\nsuch as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Chlamydia pneumoniae and viruses such as enterovirus and cytomegalovirus have been\nassociated with atherosclerosis as potentially causative or bystander participants, adding another level of complexity to the analysis\nof the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. The present review summarises the most important scientific findings published within\nthe last two decades on the importance of antigens, antigen stimulation, and adaptive immune responses in the development of\natherosclerotic plaques.\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 Natalia Milioti et al.

ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE FORMATION\nIt is di\ufb03cult to identify the factors responsible for the\ninitiation of the atheroma lesion and\/or the order in which\nthese factors contribute to plaque formation. Nevertheless,\nit is known that endothelial dysfunction and high levels\nof circulating cholesterol, as oxLDL, play a key role in the\nproinflammatory process that triggers the first steps in the\ndevelopment of atherosclerotic plaques [1, 2]. Whatever\nthe cause, these steps are characterised by an initially\nreversible accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the\nsubendothelial space as a consequence of the increasing\nmigration of blood-derived monocytes. These cells accu-\nmulate at focal points within the vascular wall of medium\nand small size arteries driven by chemokines and adhesion\nmolecules produced by the damaged endothelium [3\u20135].\nMonocytes di\ufb00erentiate in situ into macrophages which\nexpress membrane receptors such as Toll-like receptors\nand scavenger receptors that participate in the clearance\nof oxLDL [6, 7]. Lymphocytes can also transmigrate and\naccumulate within the arterial wall from the very earliest\nstages (Figure 1) [8].\nAs the inflammatory process becomes chronic, smooth\nmuscle cells also start to migrate from the media into\nthe intima layer of the vessel, in response to chemokines\nand aided by the release of membrane metalloproteinases\n(MMPs) that enable them to break through the elastic lamina\ninto the subendothelial space (Figure 1) [9, 10]. Persistence\nof inflammation creates a vicious circle of cell migration,\ndedi\ufb00erentiation of smooth muscle cells, production of\nchemotactic and proinflammatory mediators, and cell death\nleading to vascular wall remodelling and formation of a new\nlayer called neointima (Figures 1 and 2) [11, 12].\n2 Clinical and Developmental Immunology\nFibrous cap\nLipid core\nApoptosis\nNeo-intima\nSMCs\nFoam cell\nEndothelium\nLymphocyte Monocyte LDL\nTh1 Th0?\nChemokines\nMedia\nMacrophage\nLumen\nElastic\nlamina\nFigure 1: Inflammatory basis of atherosclerotic plaque formation. Led by inflammatory signals derived from the damaged endothelium,\nmonocytes and lymphocytes migrate into the vessel wall. Monocytes di\ufb00erentiate into macrophages that recognise and phagocytiose oxidised\nLDL particles. The protein component of the LDL particle is processed and presented in the form of peptides by macrophages (also by\ndendritic cells) to T-lymphocytes in the context of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II). Other self or foreign antigens\nthat may gain access to the vascular wall can also trigger similar mechanisms. It is believed that most of these lymphocytes di\ufb00erentiate\nin situ, under the influence of the specific antigen stimulation, into e\ufb00ector T-cells, but this has yet to be demonstrated. Upon activation,\nboth macrophages and lymphocytes release a range of proinflammatory molecules including chemokines which stimulate the migration of\nsmooth muscle cells (SMCs) from the media. SMCs contribute to foam cell and fibrous cap formation. This process is facilitated by cytokines\nsuch as IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 secreted by proatherogenic Th1 cells and also IL-12 secreted by macrophages and foam cells. Eventually foam cells\ndie by apoptosis in situ leaving nondegradable cholesterol crystals that form the lipid core of the plaque.\nNeointima formation is a complex phenomenon that\noccurs in response to vessel wall damage in which repair and\ninjury mechanisms give birth to areas rich in proinflamma-\ntory cells and collagen deposition [11, 12]. It is within these\nareas where a close contact between macrophages, dendritic\ncells (DCs), and lymphocytes has been reported. It has been\nspeculated that the interaction between lymphocytes and\nDCs within the neointima is responsible for the development\nof local immune responses against exogenous and endoge-\nnous atherogenic antigens. These immune responses may\ncontribute to cell death by apoptosis and accumulation of\nnondegradable cholesterol, contributing to the formation of\nthe lipid core of the atherosclerotic plaque [15\u201318]. However,\nthe precise mechanisms involved are not yet clear.\n2. THE IMMUNOLOGIC NATURE OF\nTHE ATHEROGENIC PROCESS\nAtherosclerosis belongs to the group of chronic inflam-\nmatory diseases in which the cellular components of\nthe immune system play a key role in its development\nand complications. The chronic accumulation of mono-\ncytes\/macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and T-lymphocytes\nin response to the accumulation and release of proin-\nflammatory molecules within the arterial wall constitutes\nthe hallmark of a developing atherosclerotic plaque [15].\nAlthough most of the antigenic stimuli that occur within\natherosclerotic plaques come from modified self-molecules,\nthe immune response triggered is remarkably similar to\ninflammatory reactions mounted against microbial organ-\nisms [19, 20]. The list of atherosclerosis-related antigens\nrange from oxidised low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL), heat\nshock proteins (HSP) to protein components of the extra-\ncellular matrix such as collagen and fibrinogen (Table 1).\nOn the other hand, the disputed role of foreign antigens,\nsuch as viruses and bacteria, in atherogenesis as causative\nor bystander participants in its development introduces\nanother level of complexity to the analysis. This review\nsummarises the most important scientific findings published\nwithin the last 2 decades on the importance of antigens,\nantigen stimulation, and adaptive immune responses in the\ndevelopment of atherosclerotic plaques.\n3. ATHEROSCLEROSIS-RELATED ANTIGENS\nAs stated above, both endogenous and exogenous antigens\nare involved in atherogenesis. Table 1 summarises some\nof the most studied antigens in relation to atherosclerotic\nplaque formation.\n3.1. Oxidised low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)\nOxLDL remains one of the most studied antigens in athero-\ngenesis (Figure 3). LDL does not normally trigger immune\nresponses in its native state; however when it gets oxidised, it\ncan initiate inflammation-leading to atherosclerosis. OxLDL\nis considered a neoantigen, a term used to describe modified\nNatalia Milioti et al. 3\nTable 1: Antigens that have been reported to be involved in atherogenesis.\nAntigen Reference\nAutoantigens Oxidised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) [21\u201323]\nBeta2glycoprotein1 (beta2GP1) [24\u201326]\nLipoprotein a (LP(a)) [27]\nLipoprotein-lipase (LPL) [28]\nAdvanced glycation-end products (AGE) [29]\nHeat-shock proteins [30, 31]\nCollagen [32\u201334]\nFibrinogen [35]\nMicrobial antigens Porphyromonas gingivalis [36, 37]\nChlamydia pneumoniae [38\u201349]\nBacteroides forsynthus [36]\nStreptococcus mutans [36, 37, 50]\nHelicobacter pylori [51\u201364]\nEcherichia coli [65, 66]\nEnterovirus [67\u201369]\nCytomegalovirus [22, 70\u201378]\nViperin [79]\nself-antigens for which normally the immune system is\ntolerant but which upon modification have the poten-\ntial to excerpt autoreactive immune responses. Modified\nlipoprotein particles have the capacity to interact with the\nendothelium, triggering their accumulation and retention\nin the subendothelial space. The retained oxLDL particles\ninduce macrophage foam cell formation, smooth muscle cell\nmigration and proliferation [80] and, in addition, stimulate\nthe secretion of inflammatory cytokines. OxLDL also induces\nthe expression of adhesion molecules promoting endothelial\ncell dysfunction and leukocyte extravasation [81].\nIn atherosclerosis, increased levels of oxLDL have been\nfound in the serum of patients admitted with acute myocar-\ndial infarction, and immunohistochemical studies revealed\nthe presence of oxLDL within atherosclerotic plaques [82\u2013\n85]. Proteoglycans, contained within the extracellular matrix\nof the arterial wall, interact with oxLDL via their carbo-\nhydrate groups, glycosamynoglycans (GAGs) as it has been\ndescribed in vitro and in immunohistochemical studies\nusing defective LDL unable to bind to GAGs [86]. The\ninitial interaction of LDL with the proteoglycans leads\nto structural changes that expose the GAG-binding sites\ncontributing to LDL retention. This interaction is mediated\nby apolipoprotein B (ApoB), which is the main protein\ncomponent of LDL particles [87]. At least two proteoglycan-\nbinding sequences within ApoB have been identified and\nshown to be necessary for retaining LDL particles within\nthe intimal layer [80]. The interaction between the ApoB\nand the GAGs also facilitates LDL oxidation by oxygen-\nreactive species released by vascular cells or as a result\nof enzymatic modifications driven by endothelial cells,\nsmooth muscle cells, or macrophages present within the\natherosclerotic plaques [88]. Cholesterol molecules also\nhave a high a\ufb03nity for GAGs and for the LDL receptor.\nThe accumulation of oxLDL within atherosclerotic plaques\nhas been demonstrated, among other methods, by using\nmonoclonal antibodies such as DLH3 that binds specifically\nto oxLDL but non to native LDL (nLDL) [89]. DLH3 binds\nto the oxidised phosphatidylcholine groups (oxPC) and to\nthe phosphatidylcholine (PC)-apoB adducts formed when\nLDL is oxidised. PC-apoB adducts are considered to be\nthe principal antibody targeted epitopes on the surface of\nthe particles. Furthermore, oxPC also promote endothelial-\nmonocyte adhesion by inducing the secretion of monocyte\nchemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) by endothelial cells\n[23], and can also be recognised by scavenger receptors\nsuch as CD36 which are involved in the oxLDL uptake by\nmacrophages [90\u201393].\nThe initial interaction of proteoglycans with the LDL\nwithin the arterial wall leads lipid modifications that expose\nGAG binding sites. Cholesterol, cholesteryl esters and phos-\npholipids are the main targets for lipid modifications and\ntheir role in the development of the disease has been\nextensively evaluated. These modifications play an important\nrole, as stated above, in LDL retention within the arterial\nwall which is also facilitated by interactions with surface\nmolecules such as apoE and lipoprotein lipase expressed on\nmacrophages [94].\nHowever, most studies have focused on the role of the\noxidised phospholipids (oxPLs) [95]. Peroxidation of the\nphospholipids starts in the fatty acids. The decomposition\nof the fatty acids generates a spectrum of reactive species\nsuch as malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal, and\n1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-glycero-3-phosphocholine\nmolecule (POVPC) that can oxidise apolipoprotein B\n(ApoB) as well as other lipids, resulting in ox-PLs and\noxidised protein-lipid adducts [96, 97].\nIt has also been established that oxLDL acts as a\nchemoattractant for monocytes allowing them to infiltrate\nthe lesion site. OxLDL has been shown to induce monocyte\n4 Clinical and Developmental Immunology\nLC\nFC\nSR\nM\nL\n(a)\nLC\nFC\nSR\nM\nL\n(b)\nLC\nFC\nSR\nM\nL\n(c)\nLC\nFC\nSR\nM\nL\n(d)\nFigure 2: Morphological features of advanced atherosclerotic\nplaques.

Contrasting\ndi\ufb00erences can be recognised in the anatomic development of\natherosclerotic plaques between human and mouse including the\nhypertrophy associated with the proliferation of the smooth muscle\ncells in the media layer and the fibrous cap. In humans, some lesions\nmay also contain signs of intraplaque haemorrhage. Signs of plaque\nrupture are usually best recognised in mouse (reviewed in [13, 14]).\nadhesion to the endothelium by upregulating the expres-\nsion of adhesion molecules on their surface, by inducing\nmacrophage major histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) &\nLeuM3 cell surface expression and by accelerating monocyte\ndi\ufb00erentiation in to macrophages [22].

The LDL particle has a size of approximately 21\u2013\n24 nm and is the main transporter of unesterified cholesterol,\ncholesterol esters, and triglycerides in the blood. It contains an\nouter layer composed of phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol\nin which a single protein is embedded, the apolipoprotein B-100\n(apoB-100). These components are more susceptible to oxidation\nby free radicals in the subendothelial space during inflammation.\nThey are also targets for the recognition of the LDL by scavenger\nreceptors, proteoglycans, and low-density lipoprotein receptor\n(LDLr). The core of the particle contains primarily cholesterol\nesters and triglycerides. In atherogenesis, a large number of IgM\nantibodies are created in response to oxidative stress-modified\nphospholipids, whereas IgG antibodies and T-cell clones are\ngenerated against apoB-100.\nmore monocytes. Other inflammatory mediators such as\ninterleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\n\u03b1) and monocyte colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) can\ninduce the expression of the oxLDL receptor (oxLDL-R) on\nthe surface of endothelial cells, thus further contributing to\noxLDL accumulation [22, 98].\nScavenger receptors expressed by macrophages play a piv-\notal role in LDL accumulation; such receptors include CD36\n(a membrane glycoprotein), CD68, CXCL16, the scavenger\nreceptors A & B1 (SR-A & SR-B1), and the lectin-type oxi-\ndised low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX1) [98, 99]. It\nis believed that the high expression of the scavenger receptors\non macrophages mediates lipid accumulation and foam cell\nformation [100]. Following proteolytic processing inside the\ncell, fragments of the oxidised-modified ApoB protein are\ndisplayed on the surface of macrophages bound on MHC-\nII molecules. This process also leads to the upregulation of\nimportant molecules such as toll-like receptors TLR2 and\nTLR4 that induce proatherogenic immune responses [36].\nThere is also evidence that products of the inflammatory\nprocess such as endogenous HSP60 and LDL oxidation\nderivatives bind TLR4-CD14 complexes on monocytes and\nmacrophages eliciting proinflammatory responses [30, 101,\n102]. This has been associated with an enhanced production\nof cytokines, an enhancement of oxLDL uptake, and an\nincrease adhesion of these cells to the endothelium mediated\nby IL-8 and NF\u03baB synthesis [101, 103].\nNatalia Milioti et al. 5\nThe large size of the LDL molecule (2 \u00d7 106 kDa)\nfavours the exposure of many epitopes recognised by the\nantibodies generated, mainly IgM. OxLDL is known to be\na very potent immunogen and the antibodies generated in\nresponse to its modifications are able to bind to many other\nsimilarly modified endogenous proteins [104]. It has been\ndemonstrated that there is a molecular mimicry between the\nhead of the PC groups of oxLDL and the PC groups expressed\non the surface of many pathogens such as Streptococcus\npneumoniae [105], which indicates that during an infection,\nmore autoantibodies against oxLDL might be generated.\nStudies using experimental animal models have shown that\nepitopes generated during LDL oxidation, such as oxPC, are\nalso generated on the surface of bacteria and on the surface\nof endothelial cells [21]. These epitopes bind to antibodies\nthat will mediate removal of oxLDL and apoptotic cells [106].\nSome of the oxidation-specific epitopes present on oxLDL\nare also presented on the surface of apoptotic cells in the\nlesion site, and play a role in the clearance of the damaged\noxidised lipid molecules and of apoptotic cells generated\nduring the inflammatory response within plaques [21].\n3.2. Immunisation using oxLDL confers\natheroprotection\nA series of studies have shown the beneficial side of oxLDL.\nThese studies have demonstrated that immune responses\nagainst this lipoprotein may protect against the development\nof the disease [107\u2013111]. The first report came from Palinski\net al. which immunised LDL receptor-deficient rabbits using\nhomologous MDA-LDL. This treatment induced high titres\nof antibodies displaying equal specificity as those risen by\nthe native particle and significantly reduced atherosclerotic\nplaque development [107]. Studies from other laboratories\nconfirmed these results and showed that immunisation of\nhypercholesterolemic rabbits reduced T cell and oxLDL\nimmunoreactivity within the neointima of immunized ani-\nmals [108].\nThe e\ufb00ect of LDL immunisation on atheroprotection has\nalso been assessed using mouse models of the disease. George\net al. was the first to report the e\ufb00ect of MDA modified LDL\nimmunisation in apoE-deficient mice (apoE\u2212\/\u2212). Immunised\nmice developed high titres of anti-MDA-LDL antibodies and\nthe treatment significantly reduced lesion size at the aortic\nsinus by more than half when compared with their control\nlittermates immunised with PBS. However, they did not\nfind di\ufb00erences between the groups with respect to cellular\ncomposition of the atherosclerotic plaques [109]. Later on,\nFreigang et al. showed that LDL receptor-deficient mice\n(LDLR\u2212\/\u2212) immunised with homologous malondialdehyde-\nmodified LDL (MDA-LDL) induced the synthesis of anti-\nbodies of di\ufb00erent classes against distinctive epitopes on\noxLDL and that this antibody response is significantly\ncorrelated with a reduction by approximately 40% of lesion\nsize. However, they also showed that immunisation with\nMDA-LDL raised equivalent amounts of both T helper 1\n(Th1)-related IgG2a and Th2-dependent IgG1 antibodies\n[110]. On the other hand, an elegant study carried out\nby Zhou et al. provided evidence of the involvement and\ncontrol of the production of oxLDL-induced antibodies by\nT cells. They immunised apoE\u2212\/\u2212 mice with homologous\nplaque homogenates or homologous MDA-LDL. They found\nthat both antigen preparations reduced lesion development.\nThe protective e\ufb00ect was associated with a specific raise\nof T-cell-dependent IgG antibodies against MDA-LDL and\noxidised phospholipids which are correlated with the reduc-\ntion in plaque size and circulating cholesterol levels [111].\nDespite these demonstrations, the protective role of oxLDL\nduring physiological conditions remains unknown and the\nimmunological mechanisms related with it have not yet been\nfully studied.\n3.3. \u03b22-glycoprotein I (\u03b22GpI)\nRheumatic patients su\ufb00ering from the antiphospholipid\nsyndrome produce large amounts of antiphospholipid anti-\nbodies. The standard phospholipid used to detect antiphos-\npholipid antibodies is cardiolipin, which is prone to per-\noxidation and is also an important component of the\noxLDL molecule [21]. A cofactor involved in anticardiolipin\nbinding is the \u03b22-glycoprotein I (\u03b22GpI), a positively charged\nplasma protein circulating in the blood and also present in\nplatelets and endothelial cells in atherosclerotic plaques [25].\nBinding to the aPL antibodies requires a structural change\nin \u03b22GpI which occurs when the protein binds to negatively\ncharged phospholipids present in the atherosclerotic plaques.\nWhen transgenic animals are immunised with \u03b22GpI, the\natherosclerosis process is accelerated [26]. It has been\nreported that \u03b22GpI can function as a scavenger receptor\nto mediate lipid engulfment by macrophages. Furthermore,\nhistological studies showed that \u03b22GpI is located in the\nsubendothelial space in areas rich in CD4+ T cells [24]. A\nrecent study showed that the adoptive transfer of \u03b22GpI\nreactive T cells can promote the generation of fatty streaks\nin LDL\u2212\/\u2212 mice, indicating that cellular autoimmunity is\ninvolved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [25].\n3.4. Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]\nLp(a) is an antigen of relevance to atherosclerosis devel-\nopment [27]. Lp(a) is associated with apolipoprotein(a)\n(Apo-A), another glycoprotein. Lp(a) is present in the\natherosclerotic plaques bound to fibrin. Furthermore, it\nmay be internalised by macrophages within the plaques and\ninduce the expression and secretion of chemoattractants\nfrom endothelial cells, thus triggering the attraction of\nmonocytes in to atherosclerotic plaques. This e\ufb00ect is\nspecifically attributed to the Apo-A component and suggests\nthat in the presence of high levels of Apo-A, monocyte\nrecruitment in to the vascular wall is favoured. The precise\nnature of the chemoattractant involved is not known yet, but\nGM-CSF and MCP-1 have already been discarded [27].\n3.5. Lipoprotein-lipase (LPL)\nA further self-antigen involved in lupus-related atheroscle-\nrosis is LPL [28]. It is a member of the lipase family that\nhydrolyses triglyceride molecules on lipoprotein molecules.\n6 Clinical and Developmental Immunology\nLPL activity is significantly decreased with the progression\nof the disease due to the generation of anti-LPL antibodies\n[112, 113]. The hypothesis that has been formulated is that\nthese antibodies might bind to LPL molecules on the surface\nof endothelial cells and obstruct lipid degradation by LPL,\nthus promoting lipid accumulation in the atherosclerotic\nplaques [113].\n3.6. Advanced glycation end (AGE) products\nA recent study suggests a possible role of AGE as facilitators\nof antigenic stimulation in atherosclerosis by promoting the\nmaturation of dendritic cells (DCs) [29]. AGE products\nstimulate the upregulation of costimulatory and antigen\npresenting molecules on DCs which in turn causes T\ncell proliferation through the secretion of proinflammatory\ncytokines. This activation is mediated, at least in part by\nthe upregulation of the receptors for AGE (RAGE) and\nthe scavenger receptor A (SR-A), which is responsible for\nregulating cholesterol accumulation on DCs through the\nJnk signaling pathway [29]. Immunohistological studies have\nconfirmed the expression of AGE, as well as AGE receptors\nwithin atherosclerotic lesions. Cells expressing high levels of\nRAGE have been found located close to AGE, where normal\nRAGE is expressed in low levels in the endothelium [114,\n115]. SR-A knock-out mice have decreased atherosclerotic\nlesions, therefore suggesting an indirect link between AGE\nstimulation and the development of atherosclerosis in these\nanimals [116].\n3.7. Heat shock proteins (HSPs)\nHSPs are released from stressed endothelial cells and can act\nas chaperones in the process of denaturation of other pro-\nteins. They can induce the production of specific antibodies\nwhich usually accelerate atherosclerotic plaque development\nwhen used to immunise experimental animals [26]. Human\nand microbial HSP60 activate vascular endothelial cells\nand macrophages directly through CD14 and p38 mitogen-\nactivated protein kinase signalling pathway in a similar man-\nner as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [30], leading to IL-6\nand TNF-\u03b1 secretion and promotion of atherosclerosis. HSPs\nare highly conserved among di\ufb00erent species. Antibodies\ninvolved in the atherosclerotic development recognise both\nhuman and microbial HSPs [31].\n3.8. Bacteria-derived antigens\nThe potential relationship between bacterial infections and\nthe induction of atherosclerosis has been studied in di\ufb00erent\ngroups of cardiovascular patients including those who\ndevelop the disease but that lack the conventional risk factors\nassociated with it such as hypercholesterolemia, high blood\npressure, smoking and diabetes [51]. It has been speculated\nthat bacterial infection may have a direct cytopathic e\ufb00ect\non the vascular wall or that could act indirectly through the\ninduction of an autoimmune inflammatory response involv-\ning mechanisms such as molecular mimicry and epitope\nspreading to generate atherosclerosis [19]. Several microbial\ncomponents known to ligate pattern recognition receptors or\nheat shock proteins and unmethylated CpG DNA have been\nreported as ligands for toll-like receptors (TLRs), and there-\nfore, have the potential to induce atherosclerosis [117]. TLRs\nare part of the sensing mechanisms in response to infections\nbut it has been suggested that they may also play a contradic-\ntory role in inflammation leading to atherosclerosis. There\nis evidence showing that endothelial cells and macrophages\nin atherosclerotic lesions can upregulate TLR expression\nin response to microbial antigens [36]. It is known that\nautoantibodies such as those binding to endogenous human\nHSP60 and oxidised LDL can also activate TLR4 and induce\nproatherogenic immune responses. The response involves\nthe secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, MMPs, and\nother inflammatory mediators (nitric oxide, endothelin-1)\n[118, 119].\nAn example is Porphyromonas gingivalis which has been\ndetected within atherosclerotic plaques [37]. The inflamma-\ntory action of P. gingivalis fimbriae was shown to be mediated\nby ligation of TLR2, TLR4, CD14, and beta2-integrins and\nalso by the upregulation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\n\u03baB). It has also been observed that P. gingivalis fimbriae\nmay promote atherosclerotic plaque rupture by inducing the\nsecretion of MMPs [120\u2013122]. Other pathogens studied in\nrelation to atherosclerosis are Bacteroides forsynthus, where\nthe protein A secreted by the bacterium acts through CD14\nand TLR2 ligations to induce atherosclerosis, whereas in the\ncase of Streptococcus mutans it is the protein AgI\/II that acts\nthrough CD14 and TLR4 [37].\nSimilar mechanisms have been described for Chlamy-\ndophila pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) infection where LPS\nand bacterial HSP act as ligands to TLRs. C. pneumoniae is\nan intracellular prokaryotic pathogen that infects humans\nprovoking distinct forms of pneumonia, and it has been\nalso proposed that it may cause chronic inflammatory\ndiseases such as atherosclerosis [38]. Chlamydial LPS has\nbeen shown to induce macrophage foam cell formation\nand chlamydial HSP60 is known to contribute to LDL\noxidation in the presence of macrophages on the lesion site.\nThe presence of C. pneumoniae within atheroma lesions\nhas been detected by PCR and immunohistochemistry.\nHowever, detection is sometimes di\ufb03cult due to phases\nof activity and latency of the pathogen [123, 124]. The\npathogen has been located within DCs in close proximity\nto T cells [125] but the precise mechanisms responsible\nfor the induction of immune activation and atherosclerosis\ndevelopment remain to be clarified. There is evidence that\npatients with acute myocardial infarction have higher titres\nof antibodies against C. pneumoniae than control patients\n[126]. Moreover, C. pneumoniae has been also extracted\nand cultured from atherosclerotic plaques [125, 127, 128].\nExperiments carried out in animal models demonstrated the\ninduction of atherosclerosis by inoculation of C. pneumoniae\n[129]. C. pneumoniae can persistently infect epithelial cells\nand macrophages within human atherosclerotic plaques\ncausing a chronic and nonlytic infection [128]. Immune\nresponses against Chamydia spp. infection mainly involve\nCD4+ T-helper (Th)1 cells and antibodies, although other\ncomponents such as CD8+ T cells also play a key role\nNatalia Milioti et al. 7\n[130\u2013132]. The relative contribution of these components\nto protection depends on several factors, such as the site of\ninfection, whether it is a primary or secondary infection,\nand whether the infection is acute or persistent [133].\nHowever, despite all the evidence supporting the role of\nChlamydia infection in the development of atherosclero-\nsis, its correlation with the development of complications\nremains controversial. A key element to the debate is the\nfailure of recent human clinical trials and animal studies\naiming to investigate the secondary preventive e\ufb00ect of\nantibiotics on atherosclerosis [128, 129, 134]. In these\nstudies, antibiotic therapy was e\ufb00ective in clearing the acute\ninfection, but failed to influence the atherogenic properties\nof C. pneumoniae unless the therapy was started early during\nthe acute infection [134]. It has been hypothesised that\nthis may be due to a sequestration of the organism within\natherosclerotic plaques, that makes it inaccessible to both\nantibiotics and the cellular components of the immune\nresponse.\nThe microorganism Helicobacter pylori\u2014a cause of gas-\ntrointestinal infections\u2014has been also found to be present\nin atherosclerotic lesions but completely absent from healthy\narteries [52, 53]. However, immunohistochemical studies\ncould not detect its presence in the lesions but instead\nthere was a strong cross-reactivity of the antibodies to the\ndi\ufb00erent elements of the plaque related to the acceleration of\ninflammatory events and plaque destabilisation.\nCross-reactivity has also been observed with antibodies\nagainst human HSP60 and E. coli-derived GroEL, an HSP\n[65]. The generation of anti-HSP antibodies can induce\nautoimmune reactions binding to HSP on endothelial cells\nat the lesion site where it is expressed at high levels due\nto shear stress triggered by blood pressure, stimulation by\noxLDL in situ or by inducing the secretion of proinflam-\nmatory cytokines. The down stream e\ufb00ects are endothelial\nand macrophage damage and subsequent inflammatory\nevents that lead to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis\n[135\u2013137].\n3.9. Virus-derived antigens\nViruses have also been postulated as promoters of atheroscle-\nrosis. One of the most closely linked to this disease is\ncytomegalovirus. This virus infects the majority of the\nhuman population by targeting SMCs and endothelial cells\nproducing a latent type of infection [138\u2013142]. US28, one\nof the viral proteins expressed on the cell surface of the\ncytomegalovirus after infection, is a chemoattractant for\nSMCs. US28 and UL122 proteins were found to have an\n11aa sequence homologous to human HSP60, and it is\nthought that antibodies against these viral proteins can\nbind to human HSP60 expressed on stressed endothe-\nlial cells [143]. The proteins also share some homology\nwith nonstressed endothelial cell markers such as CD151,\nCD49f, and connexin 45 (Cx45). It is believed that dur-\ning cytomegalovirus infection, antibodies generated against\nthese proteins can bind, by molecular mimicry, to the\nsurface markers on both nonstressed and already-stressed\nendothelial cells causing apoptosis of endothelial cells, which\nis considered to be one of the key early events in atheroscle-\nrotic plaque formation. It has been also suggested that\nendothelial cell stress induces HSP60 expression enhancing\nthe binding of circulating autoantibodies and amplifying\nthe endothelial cell damage [143]. Interesting results relat-\ning cytomegalovirus with atherosclerosis are derived from\nstudies investigating the expression of the viperin gene. The\nhuman viperin gene has been suggested as a potential marker\nfor cytomegalovirus infection [144]. Viperin, which is highly\nconserved among species, has a well-known antiviral e\ufb00ect\nand its use for the local treatment of cytomegalovirus has\nbeen recently proposed. Viperin is expressed by endothelial\ncells and SMCs in the vascular wall of disease vessels but\nno expression has been detected in the normal arteries\n[144].\nAnother pathogen associated with atherosclerosis is\nenterovirus, especially the enterovirus group coxsackie B\nvirus [67]. High levels of enterovirus antibodies have been\ndetected in patients with myocardial infraction but it has not\nyet been fully established whether the virus contributes to the\npathogenesis of the disease [67, 68, 145]. Other infectious\norganisms that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of\natherosclerosis involve a member of the herpes virus family\nthat is known to induce atherosclerosis in chickens [146].\nThe virus alters cellular metabolism resulting in cholesterol\naccumulation which is a common mechanism proposed for\nall virally-induced atherosclerosis. There is also evidence that\nthe virus promotes smooth muscle cells (SMCs) proliferation\n[147\u2013150].\n4. T-CELL ANTIGEN IMMUNE RESPONSES AND\nATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE DEVELOPMENT\nT lymphocytes are present in atherosclerotic plaques at\nall stages of its development [15]. Most T cells within\natherosclerotic plaques are CD4+ and a small fraction of\nthe population consists of CD8+ T cells. CD4+ cells isolated\nfrom human plaques have been found to express the \u03b1\u03b2\nT cell receptor (\u03b1\u03b2 TCR) [8, 151] that recognises antigens\npresented in the context of HLA-DR in the surface of\nAPCs. The close proximity between T lymphocytes and\nAPCs within atherosclerotic plaques supports the view\nthat these lymphocytes are involved in antigen recognition\nand antigen-specific proliferation in the shoulder regions\nof atherosclerotic lesions [81]. They are attracted to the\ntissues by chemokines and adhesion molecules expressed on\nthe surface of endothelial cells. Although the production\nof IgM, also called natural auto-antibodies, seems to be\npredominant in atherosclerosis, the presence in the serum\nof IgG antibodies specific to oxLDL epitopes is indicative of\nthe involvement of CD4+ T cells in the process of a\ufb03nity\nmaturation and isotype class switching of B-cell clones\nspecific to atherogenic antigens [21].\nThe unbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory\nimmune responses appears to be responsible for the develop-\nment of atherosclerosis. The activation of na\u0131\u00a8ve CD4+ T cells\ngenerates one of the two major types of functionally di\ufb00erent\ne\ufb00ector T cells, the T-herper1 (Th1) or the Th2. The response\nof the former cells is considered to be proinflammatory\n8 Clinical and Developmental Immunology\nin the context of atherosclerosis and is characterised by\nthe secretion of IFN-\u03b3, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 which are all\ninvolved in macrophage activation. IFN-\u03b3 also drives Th1\ncell di\ufb00erentiation that can be inhibited by IL-10 [21]. Th2\nresponse is considered to be anti-inflammatory due to the\nsecretion and action of IL-10 and other cytokines such as\nIL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, all linked to B cell activation and\ndi\ufb00erentiation. Th2 di\ufb00erentiation is favoured by IL-4 and\nit can be inhibited by IFN-\u03b3. Th1 is the predominant T cell\nsubset found in atherosclerotic lesions [70, 152, 153].\nThe type of antibody produced, driven by Th1 or Th2\nimmune responses, also plays a key role in atherogenesis [21].\nThe synthesis of IgG1 antibodies indicates a predominant\nTh2 response while IgG2a is indicative of Th1 responses [21].\nThe regulation of the balance between Th1 and Th2 immune\nresponses appears to be controlled by another T cell subset\nreferred to as regulatory T cells (Tregs) (reviewed in [154]).\nIt has been suggested that plaque size correlates with the\nnumber of Th1 cells present within the lesions [155].\nOn the other hand, Th2 activation and proliferation\nappears to be triggered by epitope-specific stimulation\n[7, 156\u2013160] or by the induction of natural antibodies\ninvolved in the clearance of lipoprotein particles [95]. Auto-\nantibodies against oxLDL have been found circulating in the\nplasma. There is a correlation between the concentrations\nof these antibodies in plasma and lesion size [161]. Recent\nexperimental evidence shows that pneumococcal vaccina-\ntion using an animal model of atherosclerosis induces the\nproduction of anti-oxLDL IgM antibodies, which inversely\ncorrelates with the development of atherosclerotic plaques\n[162]. It has been also proposed that IgM antibodies may\nbind to oxLDL preventing its binding and degradation by\nmacrophages, or even prevent the uptake of apoptotic cells by\nmacrophages [163, 164]. However, the mechanisms involved\nin the production of these antibodies or their precise role in\natherogenesis have not yet been addressed. Th2 responses are\nalso recognised in advanced stages of atherosclerosis, when\nhypercholesterolemia is prominent and there seems to be a\nshift of the immune response towards a Th2 type, indicating\nthat in late stages the immune system is trying to overcome\nthe pro-inflammatory damage [152].\nNoticeably, the therapeutic correction of the balance\nbetween these two types of responses has been pivotal for\nthe development of novel interventions, such as vaccines\nagainst the development of the disease. Experiments carried\nout using inbred stains of mice show that C57BL\/6 mice are\nmore prone to develop Th1 responses and more atheroscle-\nrosis than BALB\/c mice which are prone to develop Th2\nresponses and consequently atheroresistant [165]. It has also\nbeen noted that deletion of STAT6, a transcription factor\nrequired for the activation of Th2 responses, prone these\nmice to develop atherosclerosis [166]. Treatment of hyperc-\nholesteremic mice with recombinant IFN-\u03b3 also accelerates\natherosclerotic plaque development [167], an e\ufb00ect that is\nreversed when mice receive the drug pentoxyfyllin, a potent\nTh1 blocker [155].\nSwitching the immune response to a Th2 type can\nbe achieved by the expression of the anti-inflammatory\ncytokine IL-10 which suppresses the e\ufb00ect of proinflam-\nmatory cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 [168, 169]. The\nathero-protective e\ufb00ect of IL-10 was noted even in mice fed\na high-fat diet. However, the treatment failed to influence\nplasma cholesterol levels indicating that the IL-10 e\ufb00ects\nare due to modulation of the immune response involved in\nintraplaque inflammation mechanisms [169]. Deficiency of\nT-bet, a transcription factor required for Th1 di\ufb00erentiation,\nin experimental animals significantly reduced atherosclerotic\nlesions. This e\ufb00ect was linked to a reduction in number\nof proliferating smooth muscle cells in the intima layer\n[170]. T-bet deficient mice have also shown a skewed\nimmune response towards the Th2-type when HSPs were\nadministered to these mice [170]. These findings suggest\nthat transcriptional regulation in T cell di\ufb00erentiation can\nrepresent a good target to immunomodulate atherosclerosis.\nJust recently the first report appeared on the possible role\nof Th17 cells in cardiovascular disease [171]. Th17 cells are\ncharacterised by IL-17 (or IL-17A), IL-17F, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and\nIL-22 expressions. Their discovery has contributed to explain\ncrucial regulatory mechanisms which until now the classic\ncontrol by Th1 and Th2 or Treg cell-mediated mechanisms\ncould not explain. Th17 cells have been suggested to play\na key role in inflammation and autoimmunity. They have\nalso been involved in the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity\nreactions. The study of their role in host defence mechanisms\nhas just recently started and promises to be another area\nof high interest in cardiovascular biology research (see the\nfollowing articles for a comprehensive review of the recently\npublished literature on Th17 [172\u2013177]). Cheng et al. have\nsuggested that Th17\/Treg balance may play a key role in\ncontrolling inflammation, plaque destabilization, and the\nonset of acute coronary syndrome. They investigated this\nhypothesis by assessing Th17\/Treg functions through the\nanalysis of T cell frequencies, secretion of specific cytokines,\nand production of key transcription factors in patients\nwith acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina and stable\nangina. They found that Th17 cell numbers as well as its\ncytokines (IL-17, IL-6, and IL-23) and transcription factor\n(RORgammat) levels were significantly higher in patients\nwith acute coronary syndrome as compared to controls. The\nstudy also showed a significant decrease in Treg number,\nTreg-related cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21), and Foxp3 levels\nin these patients as compared to stable angina and controls\nsuggesting a potential role for Th17\/Treg imbalance in plaque\ndestabilization and the onset of ACS [171].\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nThe multifactorial nature of atherosclerosis also applies to\nthe number and quality of antigens capable of inducing\nproinflammatory\/proatherogenic immune responses. The\nevidence accumulated so far supports the view that oxLDL\nis one of the most important atherogenic antigens, by virtue\nof being the main trigger of monocytes\/macrophage and\nSMC infiltration, proliferation, and conversion in to foam\ncells in the neointima layer. The key role of other self-\nderived antigens such as HSPs and \u03b22-GpI and the presence\nof circulating antibodies against them, that in most cases\ncorrelates with the clinical outcome, have been used to\nNatalia Milioti et al. 9\njustify the classification of atherosclerosis as an inflammatory\ndisease with an important autoimmune component. No less\nimportant is the role of foreign antigens derived, among\nothers, from bacteria and viruses which might play a causal\nand\/or at least a bystander e\ufb00ect contributing to the chronic\ninflammatory process and its complications. Finally, the\nrole of T lymphocytes and the pro- and anti-inflammatory\nbalances controlled by their di\ufb00erent subsets has been shown\nto be crucial in the development of the disease. These\nresponses are ultimately driven by the nature of the initial\nstimuli (the antigen) and supported by a complex cascade\nof events involving cytokines, components of the extra-\ncellular matrix, and even gene expression regulators such\nas transcription factors. Our current understanding of the\nimmunopathogenic mechanisms involved in atherosclerotic\nplaque development has witnessed an enormous advance in\nthe last decade, and some of this knowledge constitutes the\nfoundation for the design of the next generation of drugs\nto combat cardiovascular disease and reduce its devastating\nconsequences for the benefit of mankind.\nREFERENCES\n[1] P.
