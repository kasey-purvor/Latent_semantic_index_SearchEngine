The idea\nof networked learning has become commonplace as an alternative to e-learning that stresses the\ninteraction of learners, tutors and resources through networks. The arguments put in this article are\nfirstly that learning technology needs to take account of the wider debate about networks and\nsecondly that research in this field needs to address the theoretical and practical issues raised by\nadvances in the field of networks. A third point is that the idea of the network acts as a powerful\nmetaphor even if we are able to discount any particular theory generated in its support. The network\nmetaphor can act as a unifying concept allowing us to bring together apparently disparate elements\nof the field. Networks are an important issue in the study of learning using advanced technologies\nand they speak to some of the central issues in learning theory such as virtual communities and\ncommunities of practice.\nIntroduction\nThe growth of the Internet and specifically the Web has opened up an apparently\nlimitless field for communication and the searching out of resources. However, theo-\nretical approaches to computer networks have hardly kept pace with the spectacular\nadoption of networks in fields such as education and learning. At the same time we\nare increasingly aware of the \u2018small world phenomenon\u2019, those strange connections\nthat seem to emerge and make this vast expanse feel much closer and more limited\n(Watts & Strogatz, 1998). Castells has recently written about the way in which the\npossibilities and limits of the Internet play out in relation to community (Castells,\n2001). He claims that the Internet is especially effective at maintaining weak ties\n(p. 129) as well as strong ties at a distance. In education the focus has often been on\nthe latter, with an interest in community and communities of practice being strongly\n*Centre for Studies in Advanced Learning Technology, Lancaster University, Cartmel College,\nLancaster, LA1 4YL, UK.

Jones\n       related to the introduction of networked technologies. The 2003 Association for\nLearning Technology Conference had as its main theme Communities of Practice.\nThe definition offered in the introductory thoughts for delegates noted that, in this\napproach, learning involved a process of engagement in a community of practice and\nthat the distinctive feature of a community of practice was sharing practice. Shared\npractice in turn requires members to have the time and space to collaborate (Lave &\nWenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998). By contrast, Castells suggests that the pattern of\nthe Internet is one of \u2018networked individualism\u2019. Castells also makes the point that\non-line communities may emerge but that they rely on networks built out of an inter-\naction between off-line and on-line sociability. This stress on the interconnection\nbetween off-line and on-line elements is a corrective to the often-overhyped claims for\nVirtual Universities and the notion that online worlds are somehow sequestered from\nreal life concerns and processes.\nNetworks\nNetworks are providing an interdisciplinary framework for understanding a wide\nrange of phenomena. The use of the term is not neutral and John Law has noted that\nthe ubiquitous nature of the metaphor may be due to more than the emergence of new\nsocial forms. Indeed, it is possible: \nthat we are in the process of uncritically reproducing some kind of dominant ideology. We\nare reproducing the ways in which the current orderings of the world like to represent\nthemselves. (Law, draft: para 1)\nAs such, networked learning is part of a hegemonic discourse not simply in educa-\ntional terms but as part of wider debates concerning the nature of social processes,\npower and culture. Law notes that when we analyse in terms of networks, we also help\nto perform networks into being. The danger he identifies is that when we write as\nnetwork analysts we may be buying into and adding strength to a managerialist\nagenda. I give this point prominence here as a corrective to any suggestion that might\narise in what follows that networks can be adopted uncritically as a technical term\nsolving a number of practical problems. Networks have within them a latent politics\nthat must be considered in our work.\nAt a simple level, mathematical modelling of networks concerns itself with the\ndescription of phenomena in terms of nodes and the links between them. Basic\ntechniques focus on the ways in which transfers can take place across a network, for\nexample whether the network is traversable or not. The importance of this field of\nstudy is that it holds out the prospect of developing mathematical laws of networks\nthat may prove to be robust in describing a broad range of phenomena. In recent years\na number of texts aimed at lay readers, originating in mathematical and physical\nscience traditions, have begun to examine phenomena from a wide range of areas,\nincluding social and biological domains (Barabasi, 2002; Buchanan, 2002). Network\nanalysis examines systems through the links between nodes in a web-like structure.\nThe nodes can be Web documents, individuals, groups, publications or language.\n Networks and learning:\n \n83\n    Within this paper I make no proper assessment of these broad claims; rather my\nintention is to draw attention to the literature, its relevance to the field of networked\nlearning and a number of conceptualisations that arise from this work.\nWork reported by Barabasi has argued that advances in the characterisation of\ncomplex networks that focus on scale-free and hierarchical architectures demonstrate\nthat a wide range of complex networks, including the Web and Internet, share these\nproperties (2002). Without attempting to develop the maths involved in a proper\ndescription of scale-free networks, it is important to state that these networks differ\nfrom random networks in which nodes are connected without any organising\nprinciple. Scale-free networks show a degree of organisation; in particular they display\na power-law distribution. Those nodes with only a few links are numerous, but a few\nnodes have a very large number of links. The power law distribution is radically differ-\nent from the familiar bell curve distribution with the distribution tapering off towards\nboth margins. The rationale behind this kind of distribution rests on some simple\npropositions. Firstly networks grow through the addition of new nodes and these new\nnodes link to pre-existing nodes. Secondly there are preferential attachments within\nthe network such that the probability of linking to a pre-existing node is higher if that\nnode already has a large number of attachments.\nAs well as being scale-free, most networks also display a high degree of clustering.\nThis clustering is consistent with the predictions of scale-free descriptions of networks\nwith a power law distribution, if a hierarchical organisation is introduced into the\nnetwork model. The presence of the hierarchical structure helps to re-interpret\nthe role of hubs in complex networks. The theory predicts a modular topology with\nself-nesting groups of nodes in clusters with dense interconnections. The overall\nsuggestion is that networks are: \n\u2026 far from random, but they evolve following robust self-organising principles and\nevolutionary laws that cross discipline boundaries. (Barabasi et al., 2002)\nThe interesting nature of these networks retains some of the advantages of random\nnetworks (such as few steps between any two nodes) with the features of organisation.\nMark Buchanan (2002) concentrates on recent developments in a well-known set\nof mathematical problems known as \u2018small world phenomena\u2019. The most popularised\nform of this problem is in the idea of \u2018six-degrees of separation\u2019: that any one person\nis likely to be connected to any other through only six steps. One of the key elements\nin the description of the networking structures and patterns that lie behind small-\nworld phenomena is the idea of the strength of weak ties. Strong links, for example\nbetween close family members, do not reach out very far. It is often the weaker links\nthat can bridge between quite different clusters in networked worlds. Buchanan\nreports a light-hearted challenge in a German newspaper to connect a Turkish kebab-\nshop owner in Frankfurt with his favourite actor, Marlon Brando. This was done using\nno more than six links of personal acquaintance using a bridging weak link, a friend\nof the kebab-shop owner living in California. The small world phenomenon draws\nattention to the need for weak links and bridging contacts to the organisation of\nnetworks. These links are central to the dissemination and propagation of ideas and\n 84\n \nC. Jones\n       are of particular interest in education. Together the idea of networks as having a self-\nnested topology and the idea of small worlds begins to map networks as self-organising\nstructures that lie somewhere between order and chaos. This positioning of networks\non the border of order and chaos offers a tantalising link with theories that have\nsuggested chaos and complexity theory as potentially rich sources of ideas for analys-\ning education (e.g. Barnett, 2000).\nNetwork society\nNetworks and the development of the Internet have profoundly affected our views\nabout how computers have impacted social life, education and learning. Social theo-\nries that postulated a new form of society in which industry and factory production\nwere replaced by service industry pre-dated the development of networks by some\nyears. This point is worth noting, as theories of the \u2018information\u2019 society, developed\nwell before networked computing, are often presented as outcomes of the application\nof computer technology. Daniel Bell\u2019s idea that just as industrial society had replaced\nagrarian society so a new post-industrial society based on services would replace\nindustrial society (1974) was later popularised in Alvin Toffler\u2019s writings as The Third\nWave (1980). Steve Wosniak, one of the originators of the personal computer at\nApple has been quoted as saying that the inventors of the PC were self-consciously\nexploring the idea of a technological revolution reshaping society (Lyon, 1995).\nWhilst the PC was an invention tangential to the development of networks, this\ncomment implies a much more sophisticated relationship between technology and\nsociety than simple technological determinism\u2014one in which the design of technical\nartefacts was informed by the very debates that claim technology as their source.\nThe information society debate still influences discussions of how networks affect\neducation and society. Policy is often based upon the idea of computer networks\nbeing the prime lever for social change; for example a recent Minister of Education\nin the UK remarked: \nWhen you look back at the development of our schools it has been very strangely evolu-\ntionary. One of the reasons for that is there has not been a development, there has not been\nan invention which has brought about a transformation which has signalled the revolution\nand if you look at health it was maybe antibiotics or it was maybe the discovery of DNA.\nIf you look at transport it was maybe the internal combustion engine and once those\ndiscoveries were made, once those changes happened nothing was ever the same again.\nI think ICT is our DNA, it\u2019s our internal combustion engine it is the trigger that can\nintroduce a revolution in how we teach and in how we learn. (Morris, 2002)\nChristine Steeples and I have discussed the persistence of the technological determin-\nist approach in networked learning and its effect on policy elsewhere (Jones &\nSteeples 2002). At this point I simply want to stress the idea that the debates about\nthe information society (and more recently networked society) inform policy makers\nwho in turn set the parameters for work in the field of networked learning. Advanced\nlearning technology is introduced in relation to policy frameworks and funding deci-\nsions that are closely associated with claims that society is fundamentally transformed\n Networks and learning:\n \n85\n            by the use of computer networks. Recently, Wolf (2002) has provided an illustration\nof how the view of a changing workforce, central to the idea of an information society,\nmisinforms a major plank of government policy. The economic case for widening\nparticipation and the massification of higher education is closely related to the idea\nthat services are replacing industries and that knowledge workers are replacing\nunskilled and manual work. In her conclusion, Wolf comments: \nFor the last quarter-century education policy has been driven consistently by preoccupa-\ntion with growth and with workplace skills \u2026 The results have been frequently disastrous.\n(Wolf, 2002, p. 244)\nIt is not necessary to agree with Wolf\u2019s anti-government agenda to agree with this\nobservation, which links failing policies with a particular view of the needs of an\ninformation society.\nA second connection with the wider debate about network society is through the\nidea of virtual community. Rheingold\u2019s highly influential book The Virtual Community\n(1993) generalised from the WELL, a virtual community based in the San Fransisco\nBay area in the mid-1980s. This book argued that the Internet opened up the possi-\nbility of a new form of community on-line, formed around shared values and interests.\nThe accounts of community facilitated by computer networks, provided by Rheingold,\nhave been aligned by others with social and situated views of learning and the idea of\ncommunities of practice in Computer Supported Collaborative (or Cooperative)\nLearning (CSCL). This claim about a technological basis for a new sociability formed\na natural alliance with educational theories that placed an emphasis on communities\nof practice. Accounts of situated learning (e.g. Brown et al., 1989; Lave & Wenger,\n1991; Wenger, 1998) have had a particular influence. A community of practice has\nbeen defined by Wenger using three dimensions: \n\u0002 what it is about\u2014as a joint enterprise as it is understood and continually renegoti-\nated by its members;\n\u0002 how it functions\u2014as a mutual engagement that binds members together into a\nsocial entity;\n\u0002 what capability it has produced\u2014the shared repertoire of communal resources\nmembers have developed over time, e.g. routines, sensibilities, artefacts and\nvocabulary.\nThis emphasis on collaboration and community stands in sharp contrast to the notion\nof networked individualism identified as a characteristic of networked society by\nCastells (1996, 2001).\nThe idea of communities of practice has recently come under critical review (Fox,\n2002a; Hodgson & Reynolds, 2002). Fox articulates a view of communities of\npractice as sub-units within wider actor-networks that include both animate and inan-\nimate elements, described as actants. He argues that communities of practice rely on\na romanticism derived from anthropological studies set outside of modern societies.\nHe goes on to suggest that its application within modern bureaucratised organisations\nfocuses on sub-cultures, non-canonical groups in the interstices of organisations.\n 86\n \nC. Jones\n     In summarising learning as peripheral participation in such communities of practice,\nFox comments: \nIt is a community which is specialised around some specific practice or other, a single task,\noccupation, interest or profession. It may rely on a certain amount of formal education as\na pre-requisite for joining (e.g. the US naval quartermasters often had to attend training\nschool), but the real learning comes from the triadic communal relations between old-\ntimers, young journey-men and\/or women and newcomers, i.e. real learning comes from\nthe social relations between people with more knowledge and skill interacting with people\nwith less knowledge and skill in the pursuit of a common practice. (Fox, 2002a, p. 111)\nAs an alternative to communities of practice Fox suggests actor\u2013network theory\n(2002a, 2002b). In his view communities of practice may be seen as a special case in\nterms of actor networks as they have specific practices within them such as mimicry,\ndemonstrating and working together. Beyond a certain scale Fox argues that a commu-\nnity of practice becomes an imagined community in which the actor-networks link and\nconnect multiple communities of practice. The view Fox outlines is one that has a\nstrong resonance with the observations by Castells in relation to networked individu-\nalism and community in networked society. Together they imply that communities\nand communities of practice are not the necessary or inevitable outcomes of networked\nsociety or networked technology; rather, they are special cases of more general network\nphenomena that rely on a particular form of individualisation.\nHodgson and Reynolds\u2019 critique of community focuses on power and democracy.\nThey argue that networked learning offers a promising medium for supporting partic-\nipative approaches to learning and that participative and democratic values are\nfacilitated because it allows for the emergence of \u2018splinter\u2019 groups based on differences\nor differences of interests. They claim that traditional approaches tend to reflect notions\nof collaboration that discourage recognition of differences and that practices in\nnetworked learning still conform to that approach. In practical terms Trehan and\nReynolds (2002) have noted that within peer assessed groups aspects of power rela-\ntions, associated with wider social networks in education, impinge on the practices of\na learning community intended to foster a cooperative and collaborative style of work-\ning. The comments of Hodgson, Reynolds and Trehan touch on some central questions\nin relation to networks and communities when they are applied to educational settings.\nNetwork metaphors can be used in such a way that power relations become diminished\nor invisible. The different access to resources held by actors in the network can be\nignored by a focus on connections between nodes rather than on which nodes act as\nattractors in the flows across the network. In education the gloss of the \u2018guide on the\nside\u2019 has often ignored the power of the tutor in setting assessment tasks and in grading\nthose assessments (Jones, 2000). As Trehan and Reynolds make clear, these power\nrelationships are also evident in the interactions of collaborative and peer assessment.\nNetworked learning in the network society\nThe claim of this paper is that the use of the network metaphor can link the different\naspects of research into the use of advanced learning technologies based on computer\n Networks and learning:\n \n87\n  networks. In this section I want to draw attention to the connections at various levels\nand how the network metaphor might be applied. The aspects I will cover are not\nexhaustive but are intended to give a flavour of the range of issues to which this\nmetaphor can be applied.\nPolicy and politics\nHigher education is currently suffering a policy overload in the UK. The government\nWhite Paper issued in the spring of 2003 may either be on its way to implementation\nor dead in the water by the time this article appears in print. The entire process of\nconsultation and negotiation of this policy will illustrate a powerful application of\nnetwork theory in terms of government and governance. The idea of policy networks\nhas developed in relation to a broad change in the relationship of government to soci-\nety. The notion of governance has been used to separate out government action and\nactions that may include government and its agencies but which incorporate a\nnetwork of bodies, some within and some outwith the boundaries of government\nitself. Governance in this sense refers to the management of \u2018self-organising, interor-\nganisational networks with the following characteristics\u2019 (Rhodes, 1997): \n1. interdependence between organisations;\n2. continuing interaction between network members;\n3. game-like interactions, rooted in trust and regulated by rules; and\n4. no sovereign authority, self-organising, with a limited state steer.\nPolitically, this structure is an organisational Third Way, standing between the\nhierarchy associated with the bureaucratic active state and the anarchy of the market\n(Rhodes, 1997).\nThere are potential concerns that this form of governance is not as loose as it might\nappear at first glance. In managerial terms the autonomy of teams, brought together\neither for specific projects or as self-managing units, is circumscribed. An early\ncommentator on new public sector management described such arrangements as\n\u2018freedom within boundaries\u2019 (Hoggart, 1991). In other words, networks can concen-\ntrate as well as disperse power. Power can be exercised in the setting of the limits\nwithin which component parts can operate. At another level, governance can concen-\ntrate its efforts on performance, on products not process. Traditional management\nmight be concerned with the way that work was conducted, with process issues.\nNetworked forms of governance shift concerns to outputs and performance, to what\nis done, not how it was achieved. The education system has been at the sharp end of\nreforms based on this model.\nThe network metaphor can also help evaluate novel policy initiatives. The evalua-\ntion of the UK\u2019s Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN) pointed to the\nnetwork nature of the organisation and how this structure affected policy that flowed\nthrough it and its influence on policy formation. The Subject Centres had a high\ndegree of autonomy in their dealings with subject communities and this in turn had a\nstrong influence on how they developed. The overall structure of the LTSN was of a\n 88\n \nC. Jones\n                 managed network and policy was introduced into this system through the Executive\nwho had a close eye on government policy and the funding councils. The flow of\npolicy initiatives was negotiated through this complex system in which power\nrelations were often expressed through financial constraints. The LTSN provided an\ninteresting example of how networks can provide a unique responsiveness to diverse\ninterests and retain a degree of structure and control that makes them of interest to\npolicy makers.\nThe LTSN is a policy initiative that relies upon remaining close to its constituency.\nTo be effective that strand of the initiative is critical. Yet that requirement sets up a\ntension with the natural desire of the funding bodies and beyond them the govern-\nment, to make such initiatives responsible for carrying through major items on the\npolicy agenda (Jones, 2002).\nNetwork metaphors are also useful in relation to new and developing forms of\nmanagement. A Dutch school of political studies has moved from using network anal-\nysis to describe government to setting out some basic guidance on how networks can\nbe managed (Kickert et al., 1997). This type of analysis may be especially appropriate\nin higher education, which has multiple centres of power and influence. Kickert et al.\ncomment that \u201cmanagement in networks is about creating strategic consensus for\njoint action within a given setting\u201d (p. 167).\nFinding a common purpose for higher education is one of the great challenges in\nthe midst of current social and technological changes, and for this an analysis of how\nmanaged networks operate is invaluable.\nNetworked learning\nA first wave of writing about the use of computer networks in education took place\nin the late 1980s and early 1990s with the emergence of such canonical texts as\nMindweave, The \u2018virtual classroom\u2019 and Online education (Mason & Kaye, 1989; Hiltz,\n1994; Harasim, 1990). The focus of these approaches was largely textual, emphasis-\ning the interactive nature of the technology and exploring how these could be used\nfor distance education in particular. Mason (1994, p. 25) commented that: \nNo concept so characterises educational thinking in the 1990s as does interactivity\u2026 So\nembedded in the spirit of the age is it that there is relatively little questioning of its value,\nmuch less evaluation of its effects.\nInteractivity altered its focus during this period from interacting with computers to\ninteracting through computers (Crook, 1994). In 1996, Koschmann tried to perio-\ndise the developments in the context of research programmes (Koschmann, 1996),\nidentifying an \u2018emerging paradigm\u2019 that he called CSCL. This emerging set of\nresearch questions was contrasted with previous outlooks, Computer Assisted\nInstruction, Intelligent Tutoring Systems and the \u2018Logo-as-Latin\u2019 paradigm associ-\nated with Papert\u2019s seminal text Mindstorms. Koschmann related the research within\nthe CSCL paradigm to socially oriented constructivist viewpoints such as the Soviet\nsociocultural theories and theories of situated cognition. Likening the paradigm shifts\n Networks and learning:\n \n89\n        he identified to a gestalt change in view, he claimed that the new paradigm drew\nattention to the social and cultural context of education as the object for research. In\ninterviews with UK academics using networked learning, the paradigm identified by\nKoschmann has been found to provide a high level philosophy informing the thinking\nof practitioners in UK higher education (Jones et al., 2000; Jones & Asensio, 2002).\nIn 2001 Koschmann returned to this theme and examined the emergent paradigm\nof CSCL in more detail: \nCSCL research has the advantage of studying learning in settings in which learning is\nobservably and accountably embedded in collaborative activity. Our concern, therefore, is\nwith the unfolding process of meaning-making within these settings, not so-called \u2018learn-\ning outcomes\u2019. It is in this way that CSCL research represents a distinctive paradigm\nwithin IT. By this standard, a study that attempted to explicate how learners jointly\naccomplished some form of new learning would be a case of CSCL research, even if they\nwere working in a setting that did not involve technological augmentation. On the other\nhand, a study that measured the effects of introducing some sort of CSCL application on\nlearning (defined in traditional ways) would not.\nI find this definition of the field unsatisfactory precisely because it fails to relate the\nresearch area to the particular features or affordances of the technology. I would\nsuggest that the technological change surrounding the Web, only in its infancy in\n1996, has been the spur to generating another set of research questions in an area that\nI would describe as networked learning.\nThe Centre for Studies of Advanced Learning Technology (CSALT) group at\nLancaster University and I have been associated with the following definition of\nnetworked learning: \nNetworked learning is learning in which information and communication technology\n(C&IT) is used to promote connections: between one learner and other learners, between\nlearners and tutors; between a learning community and its learning resources.\nThis definition of networked learning is, like CSCL, related to social theories of learn-\ning. It develops beyond CSCL in moving away from defining the new paradigm\nsimply in terms of the local processes of social learning. Networked learning remains\nconcerned with social process but it sets itself the task of understanding the links\nbetween different nodes, the learners, the tutors and the resources that make up a\nnetworked learning setting. The growth of the Web and the drive to digitise and make\naccessible a range of reified \u2018learning objects\u2019 has made the research focus on social\nprocess, understood as group collaboration, too narrow. It is important now to under-\nstand the relationship of individuals and groups to artefacts as a sense making activity.\nThe move from interaction with computers to interaction through computers has\nnow moved on to interaction in relation to computer networks. The computer itself is\nno longer the centre of research attention; instead it is the network and network\nresources made available through the computer. Indeed if mobile and ubiquitous\ncomputing develop strongly, the device through which the network is available may\nwell cease to be recognisable as a computer. Networked learning can take account of\npolicy, organisational and whole institution issues that arise with the embedding of\nthe new network technologies. Networked learning is still concerned with meaning\n 90\n \nC. Jones\n         making and the social process of learning but it is also concerned with the social and\norganisational dynamics within which those processes take place.\nResearch into networked learning\nAs networked learning develops it will be increasingly important to develop an\nunderstanding of how traditional research approaches might transfer to networked\nenvironments. In my own field of interests there has been a growing interest in\n\u2018virtual\u2019 or \u2018on-line\u2019 ethnography. Hine (2000) comments on some of the ways that\nthe virtual is distinct from face to face settings, noting that networked technologies\nshow \u201ca high degree of interpretive flexibility\u201d (p. 64). She argues that this flexibility\nderives from the way the technology is dependent upon different contexts and the\nway that the technology has to be \u201cacquired, learnt, interpreted and incorporated\ninto context\u201d (p. 64). Hine\u2019s conclusion is that: \nVirtual ethnography is adequate for the practical purpose of exploring the relations of medi-\nated interaction, even if not quite the real thing in methodologically purist terms. (p. 65)\nWittel has also explored the move \u2018From Field to Net to Internet\u2019 and has suggested\na move to an ethnography of networks (2000).\nNetworks are still strongly related to geographical space\u2014like field. Unlike field, a network\nis an open structure, able to expand almost without limits and highly dynamic. And even\nmore important: A network does not merely consist of a set of nodes but also a set of\nconnections between nodes. As such, networks contain as much movement and flow as\nthey contain residence and localities. An ethnography of networks would contain the\nexamination of nodes of a net and the examination of the connections and flows (money,\nobjects, people, ideas etc) between these nodes.[5]\nHis conclusion is similar to Hine\u2019s, recommending a reshaping of the concept of\nfield site to one focused on flow and connectivity. By continuing to place an emphasis\non the node within a network, Wittel\u2019s formulation has the benefit of retaining some\naspects of the idea of location within the expansion of the concept to cover flow and\nconnectivity.\nConclusions\nI have argued that using the metaphor of networks can assist us to theorise the broad\ncontext in which learning and education take place in a society reliant on computer\nnetworks. I have not outlined a research programme associated with this view but\nthere are within this article strong hints that such a research programme could and\npossibly should be elaborated. Networks provide a useful focus for analysing the\npatterns of growth and interaction in a wide range of fields. The use of the network\nmetaphor in learning technology helps us to connect ourselves to that wider debate\nand to theorising about the fundamental nature of the network and patterns of activity\nassociated with it. The use of the network metaphor also links our work in learning\ntechnology with that concerning the network society. This has direct connections to\n Networks and learning:\n \n91\n                  learning technology because it informs debates in higher education and training in\nterms of the type of workforce that awaits our current students and the type of skills\nthey are likely to need.\nThe networked society debate directly relates to the ideas of virtual communities\nand communities of practice. Network theory suggests that the strong notions of\ncommunity within these theoretical approaches might ignore the importance of the\n\u2018strength of weak links\u2019. Networks can be structured in ways that combine both the\nbenefits of random and organised patterns. The educational focus on strong links and\ncommunity may have made less visible those necessary but weak connections that\nmake the network idea so powerful. The idea of online communities also tends to\nseparate out and privilege the virtual against the real. The ideas of online and offline\ncommunities need to merge in the activity of real people who are both simultaneously\non and offline when they are engaged with computer networks.\nIn relating networked learning to the networked society this paper has identified\nthree areas that may be open to investigation using network analysis. Policy, politics\nand management is one area in which network analysis is already well developed in\nways that may be of direct use for researchers in learning technology. This is also an\narea in which the idea of networks can help social practice theories of social and situ-\nated learning connect themselves to the policy debate. The idea of clusters and hubs\nin hierarchical networks may allow us to develop a rich picture of just how it is that\ncommunities of practice relate to the wider policy networks in education. In terms of\nthe current dominant paradigms influencing learning technologists, the network\nmetaphor assists in shifting the emphasis towards the reifications deployed in\nnetworks alongside a focus on meaning-making. Finally the paper raises the question\nof research methods. It raises the possibility that researchers may need to adjust and\namplify their methods to take advantage of new possibilities and to translate classic\nresearch methods into the network setting.\nAcknowledgements\nThis paper is based on a research paper presented at ALT-C 2003 and published in\nthe conference\u2019s research proceedings.\nReferences\nBarabasi, A-L.
