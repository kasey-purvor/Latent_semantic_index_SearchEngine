(Marken, 2005) \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe weblog or blog is a recent and relatively popular phenomenon which is deemed to have \nthe potential to promote citizen participation in the media, and in particular in the \nproduction of (critical) media content by \u2018netizens\u2019 (Hauben, 1995). A blog can be defined \nas an online diary allowing the author(s) to share her\/his\/their views on a variety of subjects \ndirected at a potentially global, but more often local or micro-publics, while at the same \ntime also implicating its audience into responding and interacting with the content \nproduced by the blogger.  \n \nMore and more the notion of the blogosphere is being introduced in academic and in \npopular discourse to indicate the collectivity of weblogs. In doing so the Habermassian \nnotion of the public sphere is invoked (Habermas, 1974\/1989). The public sphere refers to a \n(national) sphere, independent from state and market, where public opinion and consensus \nis formed through communicative action, through the free and open exchange of rational \narguments between status-free citizens. Currently, the Habermassian public sphere could \nbest be understood as \u2018a discursive arena that is home to citizen debate, deliberation, \nagreement and action\u2019 (Villa, 1992: 712). The blogosphere can be deconstructed in a \nvariety of ways: as alternative citizen journalism, as participatory media enabling citizens \nand activists to produce their own content, as a social platform to communicate with friends \nand family, and as a vehicle for airing (counter-hegemonic) viewpoints, but also as a \npropaganda instrument, a marketing tool and a distribution channel. (See: Allan, 2002; \nKahn and Kellner, 2004; Deuze, 2005; Tremayne, 2006; Keren, 2006; Keen, 2007). \n  \nIt is therefore not surprising that the blogosphere is characterised by a high degree of \ndiversity \u2013 in format, in discourse, and in exposure. Not all blogs have a political character \nin the strict sense of the word, but the definition of what may be considered political also \nplays a vital role here. Is the political only regarded from a narrow institutional and \nprocedural perspective, or from a broader perspective, which also includes for example \nsexual and gender identities, or which sees everyday life as inherently political (de Certeau, \n1988; Mouffe, 2005)? From this maximalist perspective of the political, blogs do \u2013 in many \ncases \u2013 politicise the private, fuelled by the politics of visibility or \u2018the struggles for \nvisibility\u2019, which characterise the \u2018non-localized space of mediated publicness\u2019 (Thompson, \n1995: 247). This radical plurality of the blogosphere, its fragmentation into micro-publics, \nits semi-deterritorialised nature, its focus on the intimate and on authenticity rather then on \nthe rational and the common good, as well as the hierarchisation of blogs, is not very \ncompatible with a reference to Habermas\u2019 public sphere theory. From this perspective an \nonline public sphere seems contradictory. Furthermore, as Dean (2001: 346-7) quite rightly \nobserves: \nto territorialize cyberia as the public sphere is to determine in advance what sort of \nengagements and identities are proper to the political and to use this determination to \nhomogenize political engagement, neutralize social space, and sanitize popular cultures. \n \nIt will therefore be argued that Mouffe\u2019s concept of agonistic public spaces as \u2018places \nfor the expression of dissensus, for bringing to the floor what forces attempt to keep \n 2 \nconcealed.\u2019 (Mouffe, quoted in Carpentier & Cammaerts, 2006: 973-4) is more adequate to \nencompass the multiplicity of expressions and voices present online. Adopting an agonistic \nposition, which favours radical pluralism above a deliberated consensus, accepts the \nomnipresence of power processes in social relations and sees conflict as constitutive of the \npolitical, is not without dangers. While it can be seen as beneficial to a vibrant (online) \ncivic culture or for the promotion of what Mouffe (1999: 757) calls the 'multiplicity of \nvoices that a pluralist society encompasses', there is also a dark side that merely drives on \nantagonism and can be destructive for democracy rather then emancipatory (see below). \n \nBesides a focus on the collectivity of blogs and blogging as a phenomenon, there is also \nthe individual \u2018blogger\u2019 who \u2018blogs\u2019. One common assumption in recent debates on \nblogging and interactive media in general, is that the traditional distinction between the \namateur and the (professional) producers of the media content is increasingly blurring. In \nthis regard Allan (2002: 127) describes blogging as \u2018personalised journalism\u2019, with \ncharacteristics such as first-hand eyewitness accounts, and a two-sided communicative \nprocess between the producers of content and those who consume it. Gilmor (2006: 18) \nspeaks of a \u2018conversational mode of journalism\u2019 fueled by blogs and by citizens making \ntheir own media. It is in this regard not entirely surprising that several authors have made a \nconnection with the legacy of public journalism by calling blogs \u2018public\u2019s journalism\u2019 \n(Witt, 2004; Haas, 2005). Along the same lines, MacKinnon (2004: 10) suggests that one \nshould speak of an \u2018information community\u2019 rather than the traditional notion of \u2018the \npublic\u2019. The idea of the \u2018active public\u2019 (see Livingstone, 2003), and concepts such as \n\u2018prosumers\u2019 (Toffler, 1980) or \u2018produsers\u2019 (Bruns, 2006) are relevant as well here. A blog, \naccording to famous blogger Rebecca Blood (2002), \u2018empowers individuals on many \nlevels\u2019. This is illustrative of an emancipatory perspective towards blogs, empowering \ncitizens.  \n \nBlogs, construed as the blogosphere, are thus often associated with the key-concept of \nequal participation and a higher degree of publicness. Blogs are seen as participatory \ninteractive media, allowing citizens to freely and openly engage in the public sphere, \nproducing their own content and interacting with peers. It is, however, too readily stated \nthat new media bring along revolutionary new relationships, and that these media offer \ncitizens \u2018new\u2019 opportunities to engage or participate independently and critically in the \n(online) public sphere.This should not be accepted as unequivocal or a given. First, the \nconcept \u2018new\u2019 should still be interpreted from a historic perspective. Every renewal goes \nhand in hand with processes that reinforce power relations and hegemonies, but at the same \ntime open-up towards new avenues for change (Feather, 1995). In this regard, Slevin (2000: \n109) notes that \u2018[w]hile Internet use may hold out the possibility of emancipation, we must \nat the same time be aware of how it might create new mechanisms of suppression\u2019. Second, \nit therefore also matters what type of participation is attributed to blogs, and in particular, \nhow this participation manifests itself concretely in social, political and economic relations. \nCarpentier (2007: 88-89) convincingly argues that blogging is characterised by semi-\nparticipation: \u2018Their lack of focus on micro-participation \u2013 and on the reduction of power \nimbalances at the organisational level \u2013 renders [blog sites] different from participatory \norganisations (senso stricto).\u2019 Bloggers are usually individuals dependent on another \u2013 \noften commercial \u2013 organisation to publish and blog. Bloggers, seen as participants in \ndiscursive spaces, often have only limited control over the content they produce and upload \n(see further) and embed themselves increasingly in the inherently hyper-capitalist logic of \nthe internet. For example, it is often left unmentioned that if a blogger does not wish to be \nassociated with advertising on their blog, they need to pay between 50 and 900US$ per \n 3 \nyear for server-space and the data-traffic that they generate. It is therefore not surprising \nthat Kahn and Kellner (2004: 93) conclude that blogs, and the internet as a medium in \nitself, form part of a \u2018revolution\u2019 which \u2018promotes and disseminates the capitalist consumer \nsociety, individualism and competition, and that has involved new modes of fetishism, \nenslavement, and domination yet to be clearly perceived and theorized\u2019.  \n \nIt is in other words all too easy to regard the blog phenomenon exclusively in terms of \nthe democratic and participatory potentials and\/or the emancipatory agency of  individuals. \nAs O\u2019Neil (2005: 18) points out: \u2018Blogging signifies the extension of networking and \nlinking, but also that of controlling and excluding; however the second part of the equation \nis not usually acknowledged in male-dominated blogspace\u2019. Without minimising or \ndisregarding the democratic potentials celebrated above, one should thus also acknowledge \nthe limitations of and constraints to these participative and democratic potentials. As \nDahlgren (2004: 6) reminds us, \u2018there are clear threats to the civic potential of the Internet, \nand it certainly cannot be seen as offering any \u2018quick fix\u2019 for democracy\u2019. The focus here is \non these threats or the \u2018second part of the equation\u2019, and in this regard five problematic \nareas can be identified1. The first three can be situated at a structural\/organisational level, \nwhile the latter two relate more to an individual level of analysis: \n \nStructural\/Organisational level: \n1. Colonisation by the market \n2. Censorship by states, organisations and industries \n3. Appropriation by political (and cultural) elites  \n \nIndividual level: \n4. Social control by citizens \n5. Anti-democratic voices \n \nIn what follows, these five constraints will be discussed more in detail, and illustrated with \na couple of recent examples.  \n \n \n                                     \n1 Although the digital divide is highly relevant in this context, it is not discussed here. However, access to the information and \ncommunication infrastructure, and the knowledge and (media) literacies skills needed to deal with current media in a critical manner, and \nto search for and find relevant information, are clearly a prerequisite for meaningful participation in an online context (see Norris, 2001; \nCammaerts et al., 2003; Livingstone, 2008). \n 4 \n1. Colonisation by the Market \n \nAs mentioned before the link between blogs, bloggers and the Habermassian public sphere \nis problematic on many accounts. The \u2018blogosphere\u2019 is fragmented and not unified, it is \noften conflictual rather then consensual, and the status of the blogger plays an increasingly \nimportant role. However, there is one crucial point where Habermas\u2019 historical analysis of \nthe structural transformation of the public sphere remains relevant to online discursive \nspaces and that is his description of the colonisation or re-feudalisation of the public sphere \nby capitalist market forces (Dahlberg, 2005). \n \nIn recent years, most popular sites hosting blogs, and also social network sites, have \nbeen appropriated by large media conglomerates and venture capitalists. Prime examples in \nthis regard are Blogger.com and Blogspot.com, two of the most popular sites hosting blogs, \nwhich were taken over by Google. Google also bought the popular video-blog or vlog site \nYouTube. The developers of the social network site, MySpace, which has blog functions as \nwell, in turn sold their company to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp and Microsoft has a stake \nin Facebook. This illustrates above all that the dominant media agents are very keen to \nposition themselves in the new digital landscape where the \u2018consumer\u2019 has also become a \n\u2018producer\u2019. In addition, maimstream media players also establish their own blog services \nwhere readers may host their blogs. A good example here is Guardian Blogs \n(http:\/\/blogs.guardian.co.uk\/).  \n \nBesides the commodification of blogs and linked to that the online advertising, the \ngrowing colonisation of the blogosphere by corporate actors has also resulted in increased \nconcerns and contention regarding the issue of copyright and (intellectual) property. In this \nregard can be referred to Lessig (2004: ch 10), one of the champions of the Creative \nCommons initiative,2 who argues that \u2018Every realm is governed by copyright law, whereas \nbefore most creativity was not. The law now regulates the full range of creativity\u2014\ncommercial or not, transformative or not\u2014with the same rules designed to regulate \ncommercial publishers.\u2019 This conflict manifests itself on two levels: 1) the use of copyright \nprotected material on sites and blogs and in creative productions; 2) the question of who \nowns the copyright of the user-generated content made by produsers. Both issues present \ndifferent challenges, from a legal perspective, but also in terms of the consequences for \ncreative citizens. While the share and peer-to-peer culture online and current post-modern \ncreative processes - \u2018re-using existing artefacts and incorporating bits and pieces\u2019 (Hartley, \n2002: 22ff), clearly disrupt the commodification efforts of content by the media industry, \nthe focus here will be on the second conflict, namely the issue of copyright of self-\nproduced content published and shared within a digital environment.  \n \nA recent example of the tensions this gives rise to, was the withdrawal of his songs from \nMySpace by singer-songwriter and activist Billy Bragg. In doing so, Bragg voiced his \nprotest against the rather vague and ambiguous \u2018terms and conditions\u2019 which MySpace \nasked its users to accept. On his MySpace page Bragg wrote: The real problem is the fact \nthat they can sub-license it to any company they want and keep the royalties themselves \nwithout paying the artist a penny. It also doesn't stipulate that they can use it for non-\ncommercial use only which is what I'd want to see in that clause. The clause is basically far \ntoo open for abuse and thus I'm very wary.3 MySpace amended its conditions4 as a result of \n                                     \n2 See: http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/ \n3 See: http:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2006\/06\/08\/blly_bragg_myspace\/ (Last consulted on: 20\/05\/2008) \n 5 \nBragg\u2019s protest, but that in itself does not solve the crux of the problem. The aim of the \nbusiness-model of most so-called Web-2.0 applications is to create a financial surplus value \nby means of the \u2018user-generated content\u2019 produced for free by individuals. As Kim and \nHamilton (2006: 555) conclude in their critical analysis of OhMyNews, that this South-\nKorean citizen journalism blog-site implements \u2018an organizational model that broadens the \ndemographics of who can participate, but it also monitors the nature of those contributions \nwhile minimizing its own labour costs to its economic benefit.\u2019 \n \nDeuze (2007) draws our attention to a number of additional problematic phenomena that \nundermine the blogosphere as a critical \u2018free\u2019 democratic public sphere due to its \ncolonisation by the market. He refers to the so-called \u2018clogs\u2019, or corporate blogs, which are \nbecoming more popular by the day. Clogs are in essence extensions of the internal and \nexternal marketing and PR strategies of companies. Besides this, Deuze also mentions so-\ncalled \u2018blogolas\u2019 and \u2018flogs\u2019, which are in many ways much more problematic as they at \nthe same time feed off and undermine the authenticity claims that are often atributed to \nblogs. \u2018Blogola\u2019 refers to the payola-practices in the music industry, whereby DJ\u2019s and \nradio stations were paid to play specific music often, and in addition make positive \ncomments about it. This same practice is becoming very common in the unregulated \nblogosphere5. In the U.S. television stations and production companies increasingly shower \nbloggers with free promotion material, and some even go as far as to offer certain (popular) \nbloggers pleasure trips for promoting specific programmes (Barnes, 2007). One recent \nexample is a promotion trip that Warner Bros organised for 7 bloggers in the framework of \ntheir PR-campaign to launch their new show \u2018Supernatural\u2019. Another example was the \ncasting of a blogger in the comedy series Scrubs, produced by ABC (Deuze, 2007).  \n \nA \u2018flog\u2019 then is a fake blog, or a blog that goes even further than a clog, and could \nactually be seen as part of a manipulative PR strategy of a company (or industry). Keen \n(2007: 85) defines floggers as \u2018bloggers who claim to be independent but are actually in \nthe pay of a sponsor\u2019. Deuze (2007) mentions the \u2018Wal-Marting Across America\u2019 blog,6 \nwhich reported in 2006 on a road-trip through the U.S. by two apparent Wal-Mart fans, \ngoing from Wal-Mart to Wal-Mart. On closer inspection it transpired that the two \u2018fans\u2019 \nwere actually a freelance journalist and a professional photographer employed by the \nWashington Post and sponsored by Wal-Mart (Gogoi, 2006). It also became apparent that \nthe entire campaign was set up by the PR-firm, Edelman. In addition, Edelman created two \nother flogs for Wal-Mart: Working Families for Wal-Mart \u2013 allegedly a grassroots \nadvocacy group, which is \u2018committed to fostering open and honest dialogue [...] that \nconveys the positive contributions of Wal-Mart to working families.\u2019 and PaidCritics.com \u2013\ndevoted to \u2018exposing\u2019 the connections between labour unions and other vested interests, \nthat are \u2018smearing Wal-Mart\u2019 (Siebert, 2006). \n \nSo, even though the internet was initially based on a non-profit philosophy, its recent \nhistory shows that market forces have established themselves as the hegemonic paradigm \nof the medium. This does not imply, however, that those advocating the not-for-profit \nideals of the early internet are entirely absent or passive, on the contrary. The creative \ncommons initiative, open source developments, freeware, free online academic content, the \ncommunication rights campaigns are all manifestations of this (Walch, 2002; Lessig 2004; \n                                                                                                              \n4 See here the most recent version of the terms and conditions of MySpace: http:\/\/collect.myspace.com\/misc\/terms.html?z=1 (Last \nconsulted on: 20\/05\/2008) \n5 TV and radio in the U.S. are regulated to prevent the old-time practices of payola. \n6 See URL: http:\/\/walmartingacrossamerica.com\/ and http:\/\/edelman.com\/ \n 6 \nPadovani, 2004).  Having said this, the other side of the coin is that the political economy \nof the new media industry is characterized by an ever more increasing commodification of \ncontent, and by concentration trends leading to the creation of oligopolies, both within \ncertain existing niches or across niches (Mansell, 2004; Murdoch and Golding, 2005). In \nthis regard, we can speak of a constant and highly conflictual dialectic between the \ncapitalist paradigm and the communitarian free access paradigm, which will never be \nentirely resolved. And this is precisely why this conflictual dialectic produces a permanent \ndevelopment and deployment of new strategies by all actors, attempting to reach \nconflicting aims, but never quite fully achieving these.  \n \n \n2. Censorship and Intimidation by States and Employers \n \nAlmost instinctively one links the idea of censorship with questionable practices of \nauthoritarian regimes who have a keen interest in curtailing the freedom of expression of \ntheir citizens, something which is highly pertinent when it comes to blogging. However, in \n(Western) democratic countries, organisations such as universities or industries are also not \ncompletely innocent when it comes to censorship, encouraging self-censorship, or in some \ncases even dismissal of employees because of what they write on their blogs.  \n \nBefore addressing the employers, the strategies being adopted by (some) states to \ncontrol the blogosphere will be discussed briefly. According to a recent report of the \nOpenNet Initiative (ONI), approximately 25 states are actively filtering the internet access \nof their citizens: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Burma\/Myanmar, China, Ethiopia, India, Iran, \nJordan, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sudan, \nSyria, Tajikistan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, UAE, Uzbekistan, Vietnam and Yemen \n(see BBC Online, 2007b). These countries, as well as others who do not filter internet \naccess but do act in a repressive manner politically, see the internet and the free flow of \nideas which it enables as a dangerous threat to the social and political status quo and \n\u2018stability\u2019, be it defined as national security, promoting religious harmony, or to protect \nsome elusive homogenous identity. For one or more of these reasons some states are not \nhappy with individual bloggers claiming their right to freedom of expression by airing their \nviews on the political and everyday matters, which in a repressive context easily become \nhighly political. The Arab world, Asia and especially China, are most active in surveilling, \ncensoring, and ferreting out political dissident debates on the internet.  \n \nA recent example of repression of bloggers is the arrest and conviction to three years\u2019 \nimprisonment of the Egyptian activist, Abdel Kareem Soliman, in February 2007. Soliman \ncalled Egyptian President Moebarak a dictator, and accused the Islamic university, al-\nAzhar, of being the breeding-ground for terrorists, and of repressing critical voices. It was \ngenerally accepted that Soliman\u2019s conviction would act as deterrent for other Egyptian \nbloggers. However, his conviction led to a campaign of solidarity which resounded not \nonly in Egypt but also internationally (see BBC Online, 2007a). In Iran blogging has also \nbecome extremely popular in recent years, and bloggers are regularly intimidated and \ncensored by the Iranian government. In his study on state intervention in the blogosphere \nby Iran, Khiabany (2007: 25) puts forward that \u2018the claim over the imminent entering of the \nworld into a distinctly new epoch where time, space, political authority, economies of scale \nand social relations will become irrelevant is not grounded in reality.\u2019 Above all, what this \nalso demonstrates, is that the so-called anonymity and potential to circumvent state control \nor coercion, offered by the internet, is mostly overrated.  \n 7 \n \nAs already indicated above, not only states watch, intimidate and even arrest citizens for \nwhat they post online. Employers also at times react in a repressive manner when \nconfronted with the \u2018freely expressed\u2019 views which their employees post online. Because \nblogs position themselves right in the middle of an ever-expanding grey zone between the \nprivate and the public, some employers regard the deepest stirrings and musings of \nemployees as a threat to the organisation\u2019s image, be they for-profit or not-for-profit.  \n \nBusinesses are becoming ever more active in terms of the surveillance of the online \nactivities of their employees; it often already starts at the recruiting stage. A survey done \namongst 800 HR managers by the social software site Viadeo, brought to light that one fifth \nof the respondents used the internet to obtain personal information about potential \ncandidates, amounting generally to googling these persons. In addition 25 percent of these \nmanagers admitted that they did not appoint a candidate on the grounds of information \nobtained online (Cheng, 2007). It could be claimed that because of the popularity of the \nphenomenon blogging, and the even greater popularity, especially amongst teenagers and \nyoung adults, of social software sites such as MySpace and Facebook, we are increasingly \nleaving behind an \u2018internet footprint\u2019 in online caches and archives. While Facebook has \nopened-up its content to search engines like Google, it states that they \u2018understand [we] \nmay not want everyone in the world to have the information [we] share on Facebook\u2019 and \nthis is why Facebook gives the user \u2018control of [their] information\u2019 (Facebook, 2007). This \nshows again that the issue of privacy and protection of online identities are increasingly \nbecoming a pressing issue and that the responsibility for protecting privacy lies squarely \nwith the individual user. \n \nThe blogging activity itself can also become a dangerous activity, when found out by \nemployers, especially if the content being posted on their blogs is critical of that particular \nemployer. For some blogging is a way of getting support from an offline community, \nhandling stress, putting the boss in his or her place, demystifying myths, or laughing at the \nmundane and routine life of an employee. Ringmar (2007: 94) states: \u2018You blog to stay \nsane. You blog to stay human\u2019. But employers often see this quite differently, and regard it \nas a threat to the carefully constructed image of their business or organisation. \u2018How the \nbosses react to such insubordination is easy to imagine. They get upset, they get mad, they \nreach for the corporate rulebook.\u2018, Ringmar (2007: 94) concludes. Ringmar himself, a \nformer lecturer at the LSE, caused havoc by voicing his critical and cynical views on his \ncolleagues and department in his personal blog \u2018Forget the Footnotes\u20197. When his superiors \nbecame aware of his blog and its content Ringmar was requested to stop blogging and \nremove the content of his blog from the internet. He refused to comply with these requests \nof self-censorship, invoking his freedom of speech and his academic freedom to write what \nhe wants where he wants (MacLeod, 2006). Because of the almost holy character of \nacademic freedom within academia, there was little that the academic authorities could do \nto him, other than slander his character, which is described in detail in his recent e-book \n(Ringmar, 2007).  \n \nThere are, however, numerous other instances where employees were dismissed because \nof their blogs or what they posted there. One of the first cases was Heather Armstrong who \nwas dismissed by her employer, paradoxically enough a dot.com business, because of the \ncriticism towards her colleagues and employer on her blog Dooce.com (see BBC Online, \n                                     \n7 See: http:\/\/ringmar.net\/forgethefootnotes\/ (Last consulted on: 20\/05\/2008) \n 8 \n2005). The name of her site also became a neologism; \u2018being dooced\u2019 \u2013 meaning being \ndismissed on the grounds of your online activities. Catherine Sanderson (2008) is another \nstriking example. During working hours she was the perfect bilingual secretary, who \nbecame La Petite Anglaise in her leisure-time, writing about her expatriate life as a single \nmother in Paris, and sometimes also about her work for a British firm with a sense for the \nhumorous and ironic. However, when her employer found out about her blog, she was \ndismissed on the spot, even though her employer\u2019s name or her real identity was never \nmentioned in the blog. In March 2007 Sanderson won the court case in France which she \nbrought against her employer, who was subsequently instructed to pay her legal fees as \nwell as one year\u2019s salary.  \n \nThere are more similar examples of employees being \u2018dooced\u2019 (see Ringmar, 2007: \n103). These, as well as other cases in this article, illustrate how the weblog has become a \nspace \u2018neither private nor public, but more exactly private and public at the same time\u2019 \n(Bauman, 1999: 3). Even though a diary has a very personal and private connotation, \nplacing it online can at the same time also be seen as a way of \u2018begging\u2019 for attention and \nfor recognition from an interested and interactive or passive and lurking (micro) public. \nHowever, in this case, the collapsing of the private and the public does not neccesarily lead \nto the emergence of new collective freedoms as Bauman foresaw, but also opens-up new \npossibilities of control from the part of employers and states.  \n \n \n3. Appropriation by Political (and Cultural) Elites \n \nIncreasingly political and cultural elites have their own weblogs. Such a blog holds many \nadvantages for elites with regard to self-marketing, PR and propaganda strategies. In \naddition, two mutually reinforcing factors should be taken into account here. First, a blog \nenables elites to disseminate their ideas (and \u2018cultural products\u2019) independent from the \nmainstream media, for it allows them (or their spokespersons) to communicate with their \nfans, supporters, sympathisers or even opponents without intermediaries, and without \nrunning the risk that a journalist could twist or \u2018spin\u2019 their words and messages. Second, \njust by being elites, their blogs are automatically read more often than those of \u2018ordinary\u2019 \nbloggers. Mainstream journalists are also part of the audience of elite blogs and mainstream \nmedia is more likely to pick up on the blog and publish a titbit or a link, thus giving the \nelite blog and also the politician or pop-star even more publicity and exposure. These two \nmutually re-enforcing strategies explain why cultural, political and economic elites use \nblogs ever more frequently. On the one hand there is a pull-movement, whereby fans, \nsympathisers, etc., are drawn to the blog of their (political and\/or cultural) idol. On the \nother hand, as they are famous to begin with, a push-movement reinforces messages, music \nand other content posted on the blog, through the mainstream media as well as through \nhyperlinks on other blogs (Drezner and Farrell, 2004). Besides \u2018established\u2019 elites, the \nblogosphere itself also produces new elites as a result of what Carr (2005) and Keen (2007) \ncall the present \u2018cult of the amateur\u2019. Hierarchisation in the blogosphere gave rise to what \nis commonly called A-list bloggers, who distinghuish themselves from other bloggers and \n\u2018ordinary\u2019 citizens, despite a lack of \u2018training, standards and ethical codes\u2019 (Keen, 2007: \n52). The focus here will be on examples of the strategic use of blogs and bloggers by \npolitical elites.  \n \nIn terms of blog-use by political elites, the U.S. is \u2013 as is traditional in (post-)modern \ncampaigning \u2013 a trendsetter. Howard Dean, an ex-governor of Vermont, was the first \n 9 \nAmerican politician who very cleverly and strategically used blogs and websites in his \ncampaign for nomination as democratic presidential candidate in 20048. By appropriating a \nstrategic communication model developed by the social movement MoveOn.org, Dean \nmanaged to create a campaign dynamic that unexpectedly put him in a position to challenge \nAl Gore. The MoveOn-strategy consisted of an interactive model of online communication \nand linking this to fund-raising and offline gatherings or meet-ups (Jacobs, 2005). The \npresidential campaign of 2004 demonstrated for the first time that the internet could not \nonly be used as an instrument for dissemination of information \u2013 independently from \nmainstream media, but that it could also be extremely valuable as an organisational \ninstrument linking-up disparate activists and sympathisers (Vaccari, 2006). It stands to \nreason that this example was followed keenly by all candidates in the 2008 US presidential \nelection campaign. Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy for the democratic nomination \non her website first. Just as almost all other candidates, her biggest rival in the primaries, \nBarack Obama, not only has his own website and different blog sites, but also a MySpace \npage, a Facebook page, a YouTube profile and a profile on the micro blogsite, Twitter9. \nThis latest Web-2.0 application allows users to send short instant-messages of less than 140 \ncharacters to all \u2018friends\u2019. These messages are not only disseminated online, but also via \nmobile networks, which could be relevant with a view to instant or alert mobilisation.  \n \nAnother phenomenon, which is similar to the blogola practices of the media industry, is \nto involve \u2018famous\u2019 political A-list bloggers in campaigns by granting them an \naccreditation to follow the campaign, or by simply employing them in the campaign. In \ndoing so established political elites re-enforce the \u2018hegemony of the amateur\u2019 (Carr, 2005), \nbut at the same time this also elicits profound questions about the credibility and \nindependence of political bloggers. For example, in 2003 the Howard Dean campaign paid \ntwo \u2018reputable\u2019 political bloggers (Jerome Armstrong from MyDD and Markos Moulitsas \nZuniga from DailyKos) 12.000 US$ each, so-called for consultancy services. However, \nZephyr Teachout - the former head of Dean\u2019s outreach campaign - claims that they were \npaid to write positively about the campaign (Bulkeley and Bandler, 2005). The campaign \nfor nomination as the Democrat candidate for the US-senate in 2006 between Connecticut \nsenator Joe Lieberman (Al Gore\u2019s former running-mate against Bush Jr. in 2000) and Ned \nLamont was also marred by blogola practices. During this campaign, Lieberman was not \nonly sharply criticised locally, but also nationally for his open support of the second Iraqi \nwar. The aggressive online anti-Lieberman campaign was largely based on the use of \nbloggers and anti-war activists10. When Lamont was nominated in 2006 as the candidate for \nthe Democratic Party, Lieberman decided to stand as an independent candidate. Eventually \nLieberman was re-elected as senator for Connecticut, which clearly indicates that we \nshould not overestimate the impact of the internet or blogs on politics. In France blogs were \nalso used extensively in the 2007 presidential campaign. Sarkozy appointed Loic Le Meur, \none of the most popular political bloggers in France, as his personal adviser on the use of \nblogs, YouTube and even Second Life in his campaign strategy. 11 \n \nThe cases above not only illustrate the increasing symbolic power of blogs, but also that \nblogs have been fully adopted as a cunning political marketing and propaganda instrument \n                                     \n8 See: http:\/\/www.deanforamerica.com\/, which was later changed to http:\/\/www.democracyforamerica.com \n9 website: http:\/\/barackobama.com\/; blog-sites: http:\/\/www.runobama.com\/blog\/, http:\/\/www.barack-obama-now.com\/blog\/; MySpace: \nhttp:\/\/www.myspace.com\/barackobama; FaceBook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/person.php?id=2355496748; YouTube: \nhttp:\/\/youtube.com\/barackobama en http:\/\/twitter.com\/ \n10 For more on this, see the documentary \u2018Blog Wars\u2019 by James Rogan \n11 See: BBC Online, 2007c ; http:\/\/loiclemeur.com\/; http:\/\/www.sarkozy.fr\/home\/ and http:\/\/www.supportersdesarkozy.com\/home \n 10 \nin the hands of political elites to communicate with citizens in an attempt to by-pass the \nmediation of media-professionals, to reach a younger generation, to recruit and mobilise \nsympathisers and to generate funds. Moreover, a politician with a blog, seen to be chatting \nwith the citizen, and present on the popular community network sites, shows that s\/he is \nweb savvy and \u2018with-it\u2019. Even though their contributions are mostly written by a copywriter \nor close aid, the image of a politician is boosted by this and in these times of image \nsculpting, the post-modern politicians must leave their traces in as many public spaces as \npossible. The same goes for the cultural elites, such as pop stars, actors and other \nprotagonists of the present day celeb-culture. Furthermore, the concept of elites is also fluid \nas the blogosphere itself produces new elites who are increasingly being appropriated, co-\nopted or even bribed by more traditional elites, be it to re-enforce certain viewpoints, to \nrally in favour of a political candidate or as was mentioned earlier to promote cultural \nproducts. As Keen (2007: 79) points out, in the blogosphere \u2018[w]e\u2019re never sure if what we \nread or see is what it seems\u2019.  \n \n \n4. Social Control and Online Intimidation \n \nIt is, however, not merely the market, governments or employers that limit the democratic \nand participative potential of the blogosphere. Fellow bloggers or visitors to the blog can \nalso potentially intimidate a blogger, and even force him or her to stop blogging. In this \nregard can be referred to the phenomenon of \u2018flame wars\u2019 in online forums (Eum, 2005; \nCammaerts, 2005: 70; Lee, 2005: 53). Flaming \u2013 or the \u2018intentional (whether successful or \nunsuccessful) negative violations of (negotiated, evolving, and situated) interactional \nnorms\u2019 (O\u2019Sullivan and Flanagin, 2003: 84) \u2013 occurs when participants to an online forum \nare humiliated or insulted by other participants to the extent that the row turns into a mud-\nslinging contest, resulting in debate to completely stop and\/or participants to withdraw. In \nthe blogosphere a similar phenomenon can take place, but because the blog, more so than \nfor example an online forum, is situated on the divide between the public and the private, \nsuch attacks are often experienced as far more personal and threatening. Ringmar (2007: \n55) notes, \u2018[y]ou cannot think and write freely as long as you are afraid of intimidations.\u2019  \n \nKim (2007) describes two interesting cases in this regard. In doing so he invokes Noelle-\nNeumann\u2019s (1984) spiral of silence12, which according to him, amounts to a spiral of \ninvisibility in an online context. Kim gives a voice to two South-Korean bloggers \u2013 Sophie \nand Joyride \u2013 both \u2018victims\u2019 of online intimidation campaigns by fellow bloggers. Sophie, a \nKorean immigrant, mother of two children, living in New York, writes a blog about \npaintings, immigration, education, and (male) sexuality on the popular South-Korean blog \nsite OhmyNews. In her blog Sophie is very open and also critical of the Korean, and \nespecially male Korean, identity. This was clearly not appreciated by a (nationalistic, male \nand anti-American) part of the South Korean blog community. As a result she started \nreceiving more and more snide and insulting comments from other bloggers but also from \nanonymous readers of her blog, causing her sleepless nights, and eventually even making \nher stop blogging for a while. Sophia then switched to another (non-Korean) blog service in \norder to avoid the gaze and critiques of fellow Koreans.  \n \n                                     \n12 The spiral of silence explains why someone who holds a dissident view, often decides not to speak out rather than air \nthese views in public, for fear of being isolated.  \n 11 \nJoyride is the second blogger discussed by Kim (2007). Joyride has a popular blog, and \nis also a cartoonist. In his postings and cartoons he criticised the narrow-minded South-\nKorean nationalism, and the deep-seated racism in South-Korea against Japan and the \nJapanese. His tolerance and openness toward Japanese culture elicited many controversial \nand negative comments. Because of the personal threats in his e-mail, and the insults \ndirected at his wife, Joyride eventually decided to remove the interactive function on his \nblog making it impossible for visitors to add comments. After a month he reinstated this \nfunction (giving as reason the fact that he missed the positive feedback), but he no longer \nreplied to postings, and the tone of his postings and cartoons also became distinctly milder.  \n \nIn Belgium, Kelly Deriemaeker (aka Lillith), who writes a blog called Tales from the \nCrib13, became so popular that she was co-opted by a gossip magazine called Story to re-\ninvigorate the magazine. However, she does acknowledge that the more famous she \nbecame the more she self-censored herself. While her visibility gradually increased, she \nbecame aware that her neighbours are also reading her blog, so \u2018a post about their cry-baby \nthat kept me awake all night, is not possible anymore\u2019 (quoted in De Morgen, 2008: 35). At \nthe same time, more visibility also attracts more negative comments from readers. She \nstates that she shouldn\u2019t be bothered by or care about such negative comments, but \nnevertheless \u2018those comments haunt your mind\u2019 (quoted in De Morgen, 2008: 35). \n \nThe case of Lillith, Kim\u2019s study, as well as others (O\u2019Sullivan and Flanagin, 2003; Eum, \n2005), indicate that there is an inherent contradiction in the dynamics between the private \nand the public in relation to blogging. On the one hand visibility is essential, and is actively \nsought in order to promote the popularity of the blog, but on the other hand this visibility \nand popularity also leads to an increase possibility of social control and intimidation. Social \ncontrol thus manifests itself both in the Foucauldian panoptic sense \u2013 the few watching the \nmany \u2013 as in a synoptic sense \u2013 the many watching the few. Both are closely linked, and re-\nenforce each other, as Lyon (2006: 47) also puts forward.  \n \n \n5. Anti-Publics14 \n \nThe critical tradition within social sciences has a tendency to focus on progressive \nmovements. However, it cannot be ignored that there are many anti-publics active in a \ndemocracy, certainly online. These anti-democratic forces openly question deeply rooted \ndemocratic values and flirt with the limits of freedom of expression. Contrary to the US, \nwhere freedom of expression is almost absolute and constitutionally protected by the First \nAmendment, European countries have adopted a more ethically inspired delineation \nbetween what is protected by freedom of expression and what is not. For example, \nparliaments in many European countries (but also beyond) have all voted legislation that \nnot only considers incitement of violence, but also the incitement of discrimination or racial \nhatred as unacceptable within a democracy. The European tradition is thus one that, as \nButler (1997: 72) expresses, does not deny \u2018the action that the speech performs\u2019, and takes \nthe view that, in the case of incitement of racial hatred or in the case of negationism, no \nclear distinction can be made between ideas and actions.  \n \n                                     \n13 See URL: http:\/\/www.talesfromthecrib.be\/ (Last consulted on: 20\/05\/2008) \n14 This is partly based on Cammaerts, 2007 \n 12 \nA pertinent example of how controversial this debate is, are the extreme-right blogs and \nonline forums, and the hurtful discourses being produced there. In Belgium the website \nCyberhate.be of the Center for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism (CGKR) \nreceives on average about 30 complaints per month (Sofie D\u2019Huster, e-mail interview, \n21\/05\/2007). It is clear that extreme-right movements and activists, as well as individual \nbloggers, increasingly (ab)use the right to freedom of expression as the ultimate argument \nto claim their \u2018democratic\u2019 right to be a racist.  \n \nIn spring of 2006 this phenomenon was boldly demonstrated by the hateful discourses \nproduced by North-Belgian bloggers in the aftermath of the murder of Joe Van Holsbeke in \nBrussels\u2019 central station (12\/04) by Polish kids, and the involuntary manslaughter of Guido \nDemoor on Bus 23 in Antwerp (24\/06) by Moroccan youngsters. With reference to the \nmurder of Joe Van Holsbeke, Paul Belien, a Vlaams Belang ideologist, posted a text with \nthe title \u2018Geef ons Wapens\u2019 (\u2018Give us Weapons\u2019), in which he compares the (then still \npresumed) Moroccan perpetrators with predators who are taught to kill during the \nsacrificial feast, and are not afraid of blood. From there on he calls for the taking up of \narms by the \u2018own nation\u2019. With respect to the death of Guido Demoor, Luc Van Balberghe, \nan extreme-right journalist and publisher, posted the following on his blog, \u2018Vrij van \nZegel\u2019: In Antwerp every respectable white is bursting with (as yet) suppressed anger. \nAnger at the vermin who think that the city belongs to them. Anger at the utter helplessness, \nbecause every person in his right mind has to hold his tongue in cheek and meekly bow \nbefore the foreign leeches. (http:\/\/www.vrijvanzegel.net\/, 27\/06\/2006 \u2013 author\u2019s \ntranslation). In both instances the CGKR filed official complaints. Belien removed his \nposting, and Van Balgerghe amended his considerably. He replaced the words \u2018ongedierte\u2019 \n(\u2018vermin\u2019) and \u2018bloedzuigers\u2019 (\u2018leeches\u2019) with \u2018jongeren\u2019 (\u2018youths\u2019), and also removed a \ncontroversial allegory about ants needing to be exterminated with DDT.  \n \nOnline forums also pose particular problems. US-based sites such as Stormfront and \nBlood&Honour all have sub-sites in different languages, allowing European extreme-right \nand fascist activists to voice racist language or distribute content relating to Holocaust \ndenial in their own language. Much of what is being posted on these sites is in senso stricto \nprohibited by the Belgian anti-racist and anti-discrimination legislation (1981\/2003), as \nwell as by the law that prohibits negationism (1995). A particularily distasteful example of \nthis were the extremely racist discourses posted on the Stormfront site after the murder in \nAntwerp\u2019s inner city of the Nigerian au-pair Oulematou Niangadou and Luna Drowart, the \nbaby she was minding, by an extreme-right youngster (May 2006). Below some examples \nin translation of reactions on the Dutch-speaking part of Stormfront15: \n \n\u2022 Pfff, this does not keep me awake. I just cannot understand why he also shot the white \nchild. (Watch Out, 11\/05\/2006 \u2013 own translation) \n\u2022 You shot a negro woman, why did you then shoot the baby? While there are enough \nother blacks in the neighbourhood? (NSDA-pe, 12\/05\/2006 \u2013 own translation) \n\u2022 He could at least have taken a few other Jews with him. Antwerp stinks of Jews. \n(Hidrich, Posting on Stormfront, 13\/05\/2006 \u2013 author\u2019s translation) \n \nEvery right and left-minded citizen cannot but react emotionally when confronted with \nsuch \u2018wounding\u2019 words (Matsuda, et al., 1993). However, the internet makes it possible for \n\u2018netizens\u2019 living in Belgium to claim (certain) rights in the US. As such, the physical \n                                     \n15 please accept my apology for the offensive content \n 13 \nlocation where the site is hosted, determines which legislation applies. Sofie D\u2019Hulster of \nthe CGKR confirms this: there is no legal procedure in place to silence these website. Even \nthough the website is accessible in different languages, among them also Dutch and \nFrench, we are unable to do anything in terms of Belgian legislation. (email interview, \n21\/05\/2007 \u2013 author\u2019s translation) \n \nThis raises many questions for which there are no easy answers. Questions such as: \nDoes it make sense to ban such anti-publics from the public sphere? European governments \ncould easily decide to install a filter system, blocking access from Europe to sites such as \nStormfront, but the real question is whether this serves any purpose? First, as the list of \ncountries that filter the internet showed, that is not particularly a club you would want to \nbelong to as a democratic country. Furthermore, who will ultimately decide which sites to \nblock, and what guarantees are there to prevent that other radical and alternative voices in \nsociety to be censored as well in future? In the end, it all boils down to the queston whether \na democracy and the democratic values of equality, solidarity and respect for others\u2019 views \nit embodies, should\/can\/needs to defend itself against anti-democratic forces aimed at \ndestroying democracy from within (see Popper, 1965: 265). In this regard, even Mouffe \n(2005: 120), an advocate of a radical and conflictual pluralism of ideas and movements in \nsociety, states that \u2018[a] democracy cannot treat those who put its basic institutions into \nquestion as legitimate adversaries.\u2019 However, the question remains whether (online) \ncensorship is the right strategy to combat this? Butler (1997) seems to disagree and warns \nus that the removal of certain discourses and idea\u2019s from the public space does not mean \nthat these ideas have disappeared. She even suggests that this might paradoxically \nstrengthen those views.  \n \n \n6. Conclusion \n \nThis critical overview shows that the image of the blogosphere as a deliberative space, as a \nmodel for an online (Habermassian) public sphere where every person is free to air his or \nher views, thus making rational dialogue between equal status-free participants in public \ndebates possible, is somewhat problematic to say the least. Nevertheless, Habermas\u2019 \nhistorical inquiry is still relevant in relation to the re-feudalisation of open spaces for debate \nby commcercial forces, state actors and established elites. In this overview five phenomena \nwhich undermine the participatory character of the internet and blogs were identified. Three \nof these can be situated at the structural \u2013 organisational \u2013 level: the tensions which the \ncommodification of the internet and the blogosphere bring about, the censorship of blogs \nand intimidation of bloggers by states and employers, and the appropriation of the \nblogosphere by elites as a marketing instrument. A further two are mostly situated at the \nlevel of the individual or citizen: online intimidation by fellow bloggers inducing self-\ncensorship, and the existence of anti-publics, abusing the freedom of expression with the \naim to weaken democracy and democratic values.  \n \nNew technologies always come with high expectations and strong claims about its \npotentials to foster democracy and emancipation. This was the case with radio, television, \nvideo and also with the internet. While technologies are never neutral, they are \u2013 as Carr \n(2005) points out \u2013 amoral. Humans design technologies and use them for a variety of \npurposes, which can be both beneficial as well as detrimental to democracy. As such the \ninternet is a medium rife with contradictions. While the internet is one of the drivers of the \n 14 \npresent hyper-capitalist economic system, it also makes resistance possible, as is \ndemonstrated by among others Indymedia or other activist media.  \n \nAnother noticeable contradiction is the ever more porous and fluid boundaries between \nwhat is considered to be private and public. The convergence of different types of \ncommunication \u2013 characterised before as one-to-one (the telephone), one-to-many \n(television or radio), and more recently many-to-many (peer-to-peer application or Wikis) \u2013 \nmakes privacy a contentious issue. As a result communication initially intended as private \nor directed at a limited social network can suddenly become extremely public. As Coleman \n(2005: 277) observes, a blog \u2018provides a bridge between the private, subjective sphere of \nself-expression and the socially fragile civic sphere in which publics can form and act\u2019. \nBlogs and social network sites are thus situated in that twilight zone between the private \nand the public, and as a result produsers make themselves vulnerable in terms of repressive \nstates, as well as their present and future employers. At the same time, some bloggers \npurposely attempt to maximise their publicity, thereby placing themselves openly in the \npublic space. \n \nAs pointed out earlier, it is not only capitalism, states, employers or established elites \nthat erode the participative and democratic potentials of the internet. Two examples of \ndisruptive online tactics by citizens were also provided: online intimidation by fellow \nbloggers, and the use of offensive wounding language by anti-publics. In relation to the \nformer victims of intimidation campaigns may stop \u2018talking\u2019 altogether, de-activate the \ninteractive function of their blogs, or start practicing self-censorship. In the second \ninstance, whole groups in society may be insulted or denigrated, and as a result racist \ndiscourses and ideologies may become normalised in society. \n \nThe purpose of this critical assessment of the participatory potential of blogs was to tone \ndown the often-celebratory enthusiasm displayed by many authors regarding the \nparticipatory potentials of the internet and the blogosphere in particular. The internet \ncannot be treated as a separate entity from the economic, political and cultural realities of \nthe offline world; it forms an integral part thereof. In this regard, O\u2019Neil (2005: 4) asks a \nprovocative, but relevant question: \u2018if social networks have migrated online, is it not \nlogical to assume that the processes of differentiation, hierarchisation and control which, \nby all accounts, structure offline human interactions, have also done so?\u2019. The overview in \nthis article seems to suggest the answer to this question is an unequivocal yes.  \n \nThis does, however, not mean that these potentials have to be denied all together, or \nreduced to a marginal insignificant status, on the contrary. In this regard, the many \nresistance practices against the commodification of information and culture, can be \nmentioned. But it remains important to acknowledge that there are also actors and \nphenomena at work stifling, reducing or limiting these potentialities. This is why the image \nof agonistic and even antagonistic public spaces (Mouffe, 1999), which are inherently \nconflictual and where (productive) power is constitutive of the political, is more relevant to \nmake sense of the online environment then the Habermassian consensual public sphere, \nimplied by the notion blogosphere.  \n \n 15 \nReferences: \n \nAllan, S. \u2018Reweaving the Internet: Online News of September 11\u2019, in B.
