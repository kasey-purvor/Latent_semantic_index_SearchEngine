Our intention is to decrease researchers' dependence on separately\nheld local print collections in favour of collaboratively held networked electronic resources.\nTo support this aim, GAELS (1999) has created a courseware package to teach researchers\nthe different information retrieval skills required to use such networked resources.\nIn the course of this work, we undertook a review of the literature relating to the use of\ncomputer-aided learning materials in academic libraries. We wanted to create a\nhypermedia-based package delivered over a Web platform, but we knew that writers on\n26\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 3\ncourseware development and educational theory (Laurillard, 1993; Benyon and Wood-\nruffe, 1997) had expressed caution about the effectiveness of hypermedia as a way of\nsupporting genuine educational outcomes. Moreover, well-regarded library user education\nprogrammes using both traditional and CAL-based approaches had hitherto failed to\ndisseminate the necessary level of networked information skills amongst academic staff.\nThere appeared to be no consensus on how to offer effective networked information skills\ntraining, nor on the larger issues of modifying existing patterns of research information\nuse. Before we committed ourselves to a particular approach, we wished to examine what\nprevious projects had discovered in using a variety of learning technologies for library user\neducation.\nUser education in libraries\nLibrarians interested in exploring a courseware-based approach to library user education\nhave available to them a well-developed tradition of thinking about information skills\nteaching. This has been summarized elsewhere (Tiefel, 1995), and it is not the intention of\nthis paper to re-present this material. However, it is worth noting how this tradition has\nshaped applications of educational technology to information skills teaching.\nUser education in libraries evolved at the end of the nineteenth century. It appeared that\nlibrary users were failing to make best use of library and other information resources\nbecause of a number of factors (Salony, 1995). Firstly, users did not possess the practical\nskills needed to exploit libraries. But beyond this, an intelligent information user needed a\nmore complex set of intellectual skills, habits and attitudes. Tucker (1979) summarizes\nthese as 'the art of discrimination', together with independent or life-long learning skills.\nThese higher level skills have been codified under the banner of 'information literacy'\n(Snavely and Cooper, 1997).\nThis thinking has developed along a dual path. There is a tradition of theoretical\ndeliberation about the pedagogy of information skills teaching, and alongside it there is a\npractitioner tradition of documenting practice which shows how far library professionals\nhave been able to embody good instructional models in their teaching. Thus, to cite one\nexample from many, the practitioner Hanson (1985) took instructional models from\nBruner and Gagne and applied them within the sphere of library user education. Such\nmodels emphasized important facets of the learning process. Hanson's work took from\nBruner (1966) the need to acknowledge the nature of the learner and the way in which the\nlearner obtains knowledge. Drawing on Gagne (1977), Hanson also tried to give learners\nopportunities to demonstrate how they have understood the rules of information systems\nwhile receiving feedback on their performance during practice in 'spaced reviews'.\nOne commentator (Piette, 1995) noted that such educationally well-founded work tends to\nbe frustrated by the shortcomings of the library instruction environment. Since user\neducation takes place outside the regular instructional schedule, it takes place in a vacuum,\nleaving teacher librarians with few opportunities to create an enriching process of on-going\nreview, drill or practice. Academics or course tutors, in support of whose teaching library\nuser education is offered, are far better placed to create such a learning experience. It is the\nacademic who sees how information is used to inform a student's essay, and who is best\npositioned to give feedback and advice to the student on improving such use. Librarian-\n27\nNick)oint et al \u2022 Courseware in academic library user education\ntutors can only really describe the mechanics of library use in occasional decontextualized\n'information skills' sessions. Moreover, it is only rarely that lecturers, together with library\nstaff, share the role of examining and improving patterns of information exploitation\nwithin a course, although the literature does recognize the existence and importance of\nsuch collaborations (Carlson and Miller, 1984).\nNevertheless, there is a long history in user education practice of elaborating the concept\nof 'information literacy' as a subject in its own right, that is, as a subject which can be\ntaught as a part of the standard academic curriculum outside the courses which\ninformation skills teaching normally supports (Rader, 1990). The conceiving of user\neducation as more than a simple set of practical skills, rather as a larger philosophy of\ninformation use, is an important attempt to overcome the shortcomings of the library\ninstruction environment and has had a significant impact on the content of user education\nprogrammes.\nBroadly speaking, this ambitious user education syllabus has moved away from teaching\nskills that are based on simple, mechanical tools, in favour of generic and rather abstract\nsearching principles that apply equally to any information tool (on-line catalogue,\nbibliographic database, Internet search engine). Tiefel (1995) points out that this syllabus is\ncomprehensive and broadly applicable, and it also facilitates the larger ambition of leading\nthe student towards the development of critical thinking skills.\nHowever, in response to this, there is a practitioner school of thought which is hostile to\nthe over-elaboration of the information skills programme. This school argues that the\ncontent of the user education syllabus should be essentially practical and modest, and that\nthe very existence of user education as an activity in its own right may be more a reflection\nof the inability of librarians to make their libraries and database services usable (Eadie,\n1990; Pacey, 1995). If libraries and information systems were made easier to use, then the\npractical skills component of information literacy courses would effectively disappear,\nleaving an inflated array of philosophical teaching aims that could only make sense within\nthe framework of proper, mainstream academic subject teaching. The potential of\ninformation technology to make libraries much easier to use suggests that the elimination\nof the practical skills barrier to information use may be nearer than ever before, and with it\nthe need for most library user education (Savenije, 1999).\nThe GAELS project\nThe courseware development aspect of the GAELS project, in common with most library\nuser education activity, was brought into existence by the perception of an information\nskills training need (Salony, 1995). It is the established practice of most academics and\nresearchers to depend on well-resourced library provision of hard copy journals in science,\ntechnology and medicine for current awareness and updating purposes rather than\nelectronic sources. User education programmes have failed to modify this pattern of\ninformation use (Hallmark, 1994). This restricts scientific research communities to the\nphysical environs of a university campus library and is extremely resource-intensive. Where\nsimilar research communities exist in close proximity to each other, for example within a\nmetropolitan area such as the City of Glasgow, there is inevitably a highly expensive\nduplication of printed library materials across a small geographical area. More\n28\nALT-] Volume 9 Number 3\nimportantly, it seemed likely that failure to exploit networked information resources was in\nitself an undesirable state of affairs. Given the well developed nature of modern electronic\nlibrary services, and the potential for data-sharing across the West of Scotland\nmetropolitan area network, it seemed that a courseware-based attempt to re-educate the\ndistributed engineering research communities of the Universities of Glasgow and\nStrathclyde into using networked access to library resources might be effective.\nHowever, library skills courseware implementations at Glasgow University such as the\nTILT project (Creanor, Duradell and Primrose, 1996) had had little real impact on user\neducation practice despite being acknowledged as successful examples of educational\ntechnology. Thus, they seemed to show that a courseware-based approach to modifying\nuser behaviour would have little effect in practice in re-educating research engineers in their\npattern of library use, unless the reasons behind the lack of adoption of these previous\npackages were understood.\nThe fact that we were aiming at a sophisticated, research-level group of library users meant\nthat the package should aspire to more than simple skills-based learning if it was to gain\nacceptance. Since our intended users were highly intelligent and well-motivated, they were\nhardly incapable of grasping the basic search techniques required by a number of well-\nproduced database services. It was at least arguable that the reasons for their failure to\nadopt networked information retrieval practices might be a higher-level educational issue,\npossibly one that could be understood within the framework of information literacy (Joint,\nKemp and Ashworth, 2000). It would be important to find case studies which genuinely\nmanaged to teach the core skills of information retrieval and achieve meaningful levels of\neffective implementation in practice. But also, bearing in mind critics of the concept of\ninformation literacy, it would be valuable for us to find library skills courseware case\nstudies which managed to create enriching learning experiences without falling prey to\ncharges of irrelevant educational pretension.\nNon-Web case studies\n(a) Computer-aided instruction via hypermedia\nEarly courseware development successes\nThe first well-documented uses of Computer-Aided Instruction (CAI) technologies in\nacademic library user education occurred in North American libraries during the mid-\n1980s. The technologies used may be presumed to be 'hypermedia' only in a loose sense,\nsince these studies used now obsolete packages to produce results more readily achievable\nby modern software. A number of successful outcomes were noted, with the courseware\napproach emerging favourably in comparison with traditional teaching methods (Nipp and\nStraub, 1986; Lawson, 1989).\nDeveloping a more ambitious library skills teaching package\nThese optimistic early pre-Web case studies were picked up by a later case study conducted\nbetween 1994 and 1996 (Kaplowitz and Contini, 1998). This study noted the work\nmentioned above (Lawson, 1989; Nipp and Straub, 1986) together with other optimistic\nstudies of CAI in libraries (Pask, 1988; Piette and Smith, 1991; Cherry, 1991). However,\nthe authors were cautious about the existing CAI evaluations in the literature, noting, for\nexample, that neither Pask nor Piette and Smith assessed students' skills levels after taking\n29\nNick Joint et al Courseware in academic library user education\nthe CAI. Moreover, Kaplowitz and Contini cite other writers (Harrington, 1989; Kulik,\n1989; Welsch and Loomis, 1990) who criticized the potential of CAI for real interactivity\nwith students. Kaplowitz and Contini used their insight into the literature of library CAI\nto conduct their own methodologically sound and very well-resourced CAI case study,\nsuccessfully creating a library skills package for undergraduate biologists at UCLA which\naimed at teaching more than simple information skills. Despite their initial pessimism,\ntheir study did create a courseware package capable of producing results at least equivalent\nto those of traditional user education methods.\nResource-intensive nature of sophisticated library skills teaching\nAlthough this study was optimistic about learning outcomes for library CAI, it was\npessimistic about resourcing. The package was very expensive and labour-intensive to\ndevelop, so that it was unclear whether it would be revised and used in future. A pattern\nwas developing. In the 1980s, library courseware seemed to work well in teaching simple\ntasks where drill is required for mastery (Turner, 1990). Effective packages were created\nwith simple interactive activities and sustainable resourcing which could be maintained in\nfuture. Resourcing the development of more sophisticated learning materials was\nproblematic (Kaplowitz and Contini, 1998).\nThus, if more ambitious outcomes are achievable in library skills training, the resourcing\nrequired to create such packages appears to be excessive. However, the limited emphasis on\nsophisticated learning in simple library skills training means that hypermedia packages\nhave a valuable, sustainable role in basic library instruction. Subsequent pre-Web studies\n(Dixon, Garrett and Smith, 1995; Van der Meer and Galen, 1996) confirm this, teaching\nbasic library skills with sound evaluations and good learning outcomes.\n(b) Computer-mediated communication methods\nA number of interesting CMC-based distance-learning course case studies were\ndocumented in the 1990s. These studies described teaching innovations based on email\ncommunication with dispersed groups of students. They often taught the technologies that\nwere delivering the teaching - the Internet, Usenet, listservs, and the like - and were\ndelivered as correspondence courses (Burke, 1996; Vishwanatham, Wilkins and Jevec,\n1997). More library-specific courses focused on simple information tools, such as a\ndatabase interface (Kelsey, 1999; Jensen and Sih, 1995; Butros, 1997).\nInitially, hypertext courseware technologies were not used with CMC. This was inevitable,\ngiven the incompatibility of the technologies at that time. Interactive pre-Web stand-alone\nhypermedia courseware was offered to students by in-person workshops while distance\nlearning was synonymous with CMC-based courseware. By contrast, once Web platforms\nbecame available to libraries, networking of hypertextual packages became easier and\ncourseware developers could allow themselves more flexibility of approach (Mazoue,\n1999).\nThe drive to combine a CMC-approach to courseware with other technologies derives\nfrom perceived limitations of the medium. Exposition of material via CMC technologies\nsuch as email is deemed to be labour-intensive, and so is the subsequent interaction and\nfeedback (Herther, 1997). The labour-saving automated exercises and feedback of the non-\nCMC-dependent hypermedia-based library packages are a great practical benefit. The\n30\nALT-] Volume 9 Number 3\nactivity and feedback functions of such packages require less support from tutors, even\nthough their drill-based exercises could be seen as simplistic.\nIxitcr CMC case studies\nLater successful case studies based on synchronous rather than asynchronous CMC\ntechnologies such as conferencing packages and chat rooms confirm the resource-intensive\nnature of this medium (Pival and Tunon, 1998; Simoneaux, D'Angelo and Jung, 1999).\nAs previously, problems of distance were dealt with, but staffing resources remained an\nissue. Moreover, the idea of replicating contact lecturing via conferencing software for\nlibrary skills teaching raises general questions about the suitability of the contact lecture\nfor basic library education. Because the lecture is a narrative educational format, it suits\nsome topics well, for example, chronological historical subjects, or the step-by-step\nbuilding of philosophical argument, whereas simple information skills teaching tends to\nconsist of self-contained descriptions of tools, concepts or processes, none of which\ncombine together in a linear sequence of cumulative argument or incremental drama.\nPival and Tunon (1998) advise keeping the training segment relatively short because of the\ndifficulty of sustaining lecture-type expositions. However, subsequent studies indicate that\nCMC-based solutions are suitable for more ambitious types of information-related\nteaching, such as teaching students of information management or postgraduate\ninformation scientists, either when used on their own (McMurdo and Meadows, 1996) or\nwith other approaches (Van Brakel, 1999).\nResource-intensive nature of sophisticated library skills teaching\nIn summary, there is an impressive body of library CMC case studies with adequate evaluative\ndata which show that this is a valuable technology with positive learning outcomes. If used to\nthe exclusion of other technologies, it requires good staff resourcing to succeed. It displays no\nresourcing advantages over non-Web-based hypermedia in delivering more advanced skills\ntraining. Library skills tutors with the requisite support who feel that this is a suitable\napproach may choose it for their CAL implementations with a fair degree of confidence.\nCase studies of Web-based courseware\nThe move from packages using software such as HyperCard and Toolbook to HTML-\ngenerated hypermedia resources delivered via the Web is marked by one simple but\npowerful trade-off. The more rigorous analytic approaches of earlier computer-aided\ninstruction projects are relaxed as courseware implementations become more prevalent in\neveryday library teaching practice.\nPractitioners' sense of ownership of the courseware medium\nIn the United States, the widespread adoption of HTML\/Web technologies democratized\nthe courseware development process. The mystique was removed from package authoring,\nand in some cases librarian teachers were empowered to become courseware developers\nthemselves (Laverty, 1997; Murphy, 1998). This is less true of the United Kingdom, where\nthere is a longer-lived tendency for courseware development to remain the preserve of\nsupra-institutional showcase projects outside the practitioner mainstream.\nThe Glasgow University-based TILT library CAL project (Creanor et al, 1996) created a\nToolbook package (later moved to a Web platform). As with pre-Web American\n_\nNick Joint et al Courseware in academic library user education\nimplementations, the pedagogy is rigorous and the evaluation exemplary. But the TILT\nremit required that the package had to be generic, not site-specific. However, this generic\nquality did not lead to the package being extensively adopted at other sites. This generic\napproach is typical of UK library courseware projects, and may explain why courseware\napproaches have spread less widely in UK libraries (SCONUL, 1998) as opposed to US\nlibraries (Bevilacqua, 1993). If generic British packages, such as Glasgow's, or the INTO\nINFO learning materials created by the EDUCATE project (Thomasson and Fjallbrant,\n1996; Fjallbrant, 1996), have had little documented impact in the UK outside the\ninstitutions which created them, perhaps UK courseware implementations will grow by\nfollowing the American model of locally authored CAL packages.\nInforming versus educating\n(a) Web hypertextualpublishing as effective teaching\nAs learning technologies have become increasingly the tool of the practitioner, a loss of\nfocus on certain principles has brought disadvantages. Firstly, the distinction between an\ninformation resource and an educational resource has become blurred. This can be seen in\nthe second half of the 1990s in articles about direct Web conversions of 'user education'\nhandouts or in articles which explore the Web as a 'passive' hypertext publishing medium\nwithout using drill-based interactive routines (Halvorsen, 1997; Mosley, 1998). As noted\npreviously, Benyon and Woodruffe dispute that there is educational benefit from simply\nhypertextualizing existing material as Web\/HTML resources. Halvorsen's and Mosley's\nhypertext Web publications certainly succeed as information resources, but it is not clear in\nwhat sense this success has an instructional outcome. This is unfortunate, because case\nstudies which demonstrate the educational value of hypertext learning resources without\ndrill-based routines do offer a way of escaping from simplistic multiple-choice-style on-line\nactivities.\nThere are, however, examples where 'passive' hypertext pages are claimed by the developer\nto be bibliographic instruction. The EDUCATE project has been viewed as an Internet\npublishing case study (O'Riordan, 1996) and as an interactive educational project\n(Fjallbrant, 1995). This case is made more clearly in the teaching of legislative processes as\nan aid to retrieving legal information (Hoffman, 1997). For Hoffman, 'simply hyper-\ntextualizing the material' (Benyon's phrase) is educationally beneficial because the resultant\noverview of the legislative Web on a hypertext map brings the student fully into the\nmechanism of creating new laws. As Laurillard points out (1993: 130), hypertext learning\noccurs readily 'when the world is itself textual'.\nTo summarize, the blurring of the distinction between passive Web\/HTML publishing and\ngenuine educational resources can sometimes be seen as a category error. On the other\nhand, a resource can genuinely work as a set of teaching materials while remaining largely\na form of hypertext publishing without simplistic, drill-based exercises. A direct HTML\nconversion of a high-quality correspondence course textbook, or a richly hyperlinked\nlearning environment (Hoffman, 1997) are both good examples.\n(b) Virtual library tours as educational activities\nThe claims for the instructional value of virtual library tours are similarly complex, since\nthese Web resources are essentially informative, comprising exposition of material without\nactivity and feedback. Mosley (1996) describes a rich Web user education resource\n32\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 3\npresented as a tour through a library. Other UK Web-based courseware investigations\n(Gorman and Lees, 1995; Biddiscombe, Rnowles and Upton, 1997) also prefer informa-\ntional rather than educational outcomes, as do similar US case studies (Borah, 1997;\nMurphy, 1998). All these papers describe excellent library Web pages, but their usefulness\nmay be informational not educational. Descriptions of them do not emphasize interactive\nteaching and learning achieved by drill-based routines, nor by hypermedia features.\nEducating rather than informing: true Web\/HTML library learning materials\nLibrary Web resources become more demonstrably learning materials when they leave\nbehind the metaphor of the instructional handout and the library tour. Both metaphors\nimply a user-librarian relationship, where the user passively receives information from an\ninformation provider. Once user education Web resources are created within the\nframework of the taught class, the interactive relationship of the tutor-student supplants\nthe passive user-librarian relationship. The level of educational interactivity often remains\nelementary, however.\nA pattern for Web\/HTML library learning materials\nA typical pattern emerges. A package is created to support a subject-specific class (Orians\nand Sabol, 1996); or alternatively, a course in communications, professional or study skills\nprovides a curriculum context for the library skills training (Parise, 1998; Cribb and\nWoodall, 1997). The academic level is undergraduate not research. Occasionally course-\nware focuses on a free-standing library information retrieval tool, such as a single database\nor database host, but this is rare (Prestamo, 1998; Hawkins, 1997). More often a range of\nexternal networked services and local library facilities are described.\nSuch library courseware consists of one or more modules, which offer a linear path\nthrough a set of Web pages. The student follows a primarily textual exposition of material,\nenriched with graphics, screenshots and\/or hyperlinks to information resources. A drill-\nbased quiz often concludes each module; and a more ambitious final assignment based on\nthe whole package may be given. Satisfactory completion of the quizzes and\/or larger piece\nof work is integrated into passing the departmental course supported by the package.\nEmail interaction with library staff, peers or faculty often occurs, but is not the only means\nof interactivity and feedback. Occasionally a particular feature of these packages is\nhighlighted, for example the automation of assessment (Niemeyer, 1999). However, Scholz,\nKerr and Brown (1996), Greenwood and Frisbie (1998), Lehner and Jacobson (1997) and\nNozero, Whitton and Heaton (1998) are more typical, giving equal emphasis to most\nfeatures of this model.\nEvaluation ofWeb\/HTML library learning materials\nIf interactive features are prominent here, the interest in learning outcome evaluation is less\npronounced. Occasionally evaluation of learning outcomes becomes as prominent as in\npre-Web case studies. Sabol (1998) expands earlier work (Orians and Sabol, 1999) into a\nseparate paper on evaluation. This is not typical. Later studies also abandon evaluated\ncomparisons of learning outcomes between traditional methods and courseware\napproaches. One purpose of such comparative evaluation is to convince a sceptical\naudience of the merits of learning technologies in library training, and its decline is\nregrettable.\n33\nNick Joint et al Courseware in academic library user education\nWeb\/HTML library learning materials: learning styles and interface issues\nTwo other aspects of courseware implementation without significant treatment are the\neffective accommodation of differing learning styles and interface issues. Although\nadjusting teaching content to learning styles formed an important strand in the UK\nEDULIB project (1999), we found little emphasis on this approach in the literature (Wood,\nFord and Miller, 1996).\nTo be usable, learning materials need to have a good interface, and they need to be found\neasily within a Web environment. Laverty (1997), describes the effective use of HTML\ntables as interfaces to individual sets of materials, while Fjallbrant, Bostrom and Ekman\n(1997) describe Pathfinders, a task-based interface. However, there appears to be no\npublished work dealing with the integration of library learning materials into surrounding\nlocal Web pages.\n'Conclusions about Web\/HTML case studies\nThe wider adoption of courseware approaches to library skills teaching in the US is an\nencouraging trend, though wider adoption has been accompanied by less rigorous\nattention to pedagogic issues. This can cause problems. More recent library courseware\nprojects have failed due to confusions in educational design untypical of earlier projects\n(Sonntag, 1999). However, lack of rigour in using pedagogic techniques such as evaluation\nin library teaching practice may be caused by lack of resources rather than a lack of\nawareness (Bober, Poulin and Vileno, 1995).\nThese later case studies also show that the true Web\/HTML on-line library skills class\nresembles earlier case studies. Information skills are taught by simple but effective\ninteractive exercise-and-feedback models, but generally at undergraduate level. Using a\ngeneric package for research students can be problematic (Creanor et al., 1996).\nThus, despite successes with simpler skills training for undergraduate populations, the use\nof Web\/HTML technologies in libraries has not yet demonstrated simple, resource-friendly\nways of creating more ambitious learning outcomes.\n(3) Non-case study literature and analyses of library courseware\ncollaboration\nExpert reviews and practitioner advice literature\nThere is a recent trend not to document library courseware implementations, presumably\nbecause there is little incentive to report what appears increasingly to be accepted practice.\nExpert reviews of courseware, which look at packages themselves rather than at literature\nabout them, thus have a role in creating an overview of otherwise undocumented activity\n(Cox, 1997). Dewald (1999a and 1999b) provides a combination of expert review, peda-\ngogical theory and advice on how to create good courseware.\nDewald's papers show that, when a new technology comes into professional practice, there\nis a role, not just for expert review, but also for 'how-to-do-it' literature. Certain early case\nstudies are sometimes used as general exemplars (Pask, 1988; Kaplowitz and Contini,\n1998), while others (Burke, 1996; Jensen and Sih, 1995) are used as exemplars for CMC-\nbased approaches. Practitioner librarians also look to the intelligent magazine-style advice\narticle (Ardis, 1998; Bell, 1998), or a synthesis of expert review and theory (Nipp, 1998).\n34\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 3\nPractitioner librarians may sometimes refer to non-library material, ranging from the\nintroductory (Mazoue, 1999; Driscoll, 1998) to the more theoretical (Benyon and\nWoodruffe, 1997; Laurillard, 1993). It is striking however, that much of the best general\nwriting on courseware development and instructional research is not cited by most case\nstudies. Thus, the work of influential organizations such as the CTI Centre for Library and\nInformation Studies (CTILIS, 2000; Hopkins, 1996; Hopkins, 1999), and projects such as\nNetLinkS (1998) at the University of Sheffield (Levy, Bowskill and Worsfold, 1998) have\nyet to be fully exploited by the information practitioner. It is likely that the quality of\ncurrent information skills courseware is compromised by failure to exploit such\neducational research.\nStudies of collaboration in library courseware development\nThere is little discussion in the literature of collaboration between different institutions in\nproducing library courseware. While collaboration between dispersed campuses of a single\ninstitution is common (Pival and Tunon, 1998, and Vishwanatham et al, 1997), there is\nlittle cross-institutional collaboration reported. As noted above, the establishment of a\nsense of ownership of a package limits most courseware implementations to single\ninstitutions.\nEarly optimistic reports of collaborative economies of scale in creating library learning\nmaterials (Clark, 1981) should be viewed cautiously. Wood and Agogino (1996) have\ndescribed cross-institutional engineering courseware but Faulhaber (1996) notes that,\nalthough networking learning materials creates economies of scale in multi-site language\nteaching, it does not do so in its library aspects.\nStatements that libraries can import generic packages without alteration are problematic\n(Lepge and Reid, 1998). US practice shows how packages tend to be local, not bought in.\nHigher education information environments are often highly individualized, generating\nsite-specific information skills syllabuses. This is not the case with courseware for many\nmainstream academic subjects, where the undergraduate science and engineering syllabus\nis broadly similar between institutions. Legge and Reid may be assuming similarities\nbetween library skills and mainstream subjects that do not exist. Moreover, barriers to\nlibrary collaboration may also lie in the organizational context, as analysis of an\nInternet\/library instruction course for the Utah Western Governors Virtual University has\nshown (Hansen and Lombardo, 1997).\nSummary and conclusions\nThe American literature shows that library computer-aided learning packages have entered\nmainstream practice to a greater extent than in the United Kingdom, and that they have\ndone so due to an emphasis on certain factors:\n\u2022 the practitioner sense of ownership of the courseware medium and materials;\n\u2022 sustainable resourcing in terms of skills levels to maximize maintainability;\n\u2022 tailoring to a local information environment rather than generic solutions;\n\u2022 concentrating on simple skills training for large bodies of undergraduates.\n35\nNick Joint et 0\/ Courseware in academic library user education\nRecommendations for library user education (in practice)\n\u2022 US library courseware projects can afford to create learning packages purely for local\nuse. Because British projects need to spread costs over many sites, we recommend\ncreating institutional courseware packages that can then be reduced to generic\nWeb\/HTML templates. Such templates can be shared with other UK sites who, in turn,\ntailor them to local requirements. This combines the economies of scale of generic\nmulti-site courseware with the need for local institutional identity.\n\u2022 Early library courseware implementations combined a thoughtful approach based on\nwide background reading with a strong emphasis on evaluation of learning outcomes.\nCourseware development today would benefit from adopting similar approaches,\ndrawing on equivalent contemporary research (CTILIS, 2000; NetLinkS, 1998).\nImplications for the GAELS Project\nOur response in the GAELS project has been to make evaluation a central part of the\nproject and to follow the template idea through, obtaining a solution that can be copied\nand transferred between institutions. Although such template-based approaches have\nfound little favour in non-library applications, librarian practitioners at Glasgow and\nStrathclyde have independently authored a biomedical courseware information skills\npackage (GAELS Biomedical, 2000) using templates generated from the original\nengineering package created by a specialist courseware designer. This package has been\nsuccessful in evaluated workshops with life scientists. Because there is little evidence that\ndrill-based interactive packages are suitable for research-level information skills students,\nwe have adopted a bypertextual approach to interactive learning (Hutchings, Hall and\nBriggs, 1992; McKendree, Reader and Hammond, 1995).\nThis hypertextual approach has a number of benefits:\n\u2022 Templates derived from hypertextual resources are open, flexible and easily\nreconfigured, avoiding the inhibiting constraints of other template-based approaches.\nThis approach avoids the technical complications of heavily scripted routines, thus\nfacilitating practitioner authoring of courseware.\n\u2022 Practitioners feel that they have ownership of the courseware-authoring medium and\ncan make their packages institution-specific.\n\u2022 The need for expensive technical support is also dispensed with, thus avoiding the\nresourcing problems of otherwise successful library courseware implementations\nwhich ultimately prevent the packages being widely adopted once project funding is\nwithdrawn.\n\u2022 A rich hypertextual learning environment is suitable for engaging the learner in the\nhigher-level information usage issues that underpin researchers' information-gathering\npractice. The mechanistic scripted routines pervading most information skills\ncourseware are not suited to this, and if adopted by us, would not offer an effective\nmeans for modifying researchers' dependence on browsing local hard copy research\ncollections.\nWe believe that at the time of writing this is the first example in the UK of librarian\npractitioners with no previous background in courseware design successfully authoring\n36\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 3\ntheir own information skills courseware packages along the lines of US case studies. We\nthus believe that GAELS offers a good model of courseware implementation for other UK\nlibraries to emulate, and suggest that our strategies for involving practitioners directly in\nthe process of courseware development may be useful in other non-library subjects where\npractitioner involvement is required.\nReferences\nArdis, S.
