Recent  evidence  has  shown  specific  effects  of \nammonia (NH3) on plant community composition (a true ecological effect) at much \nsmaller concentrations. The methods used in setting a CLENH3 are reviewed, and the \navailable  evidence  collated,  in  proposing  a  new  CLENH3 for  different  types  of \nvegetation. For lichens and bryophytes, we propose a new CLENH3 of 1 \u00b5g NH3 m-3 as \na  long-term  (several  year)  average  concentration;  for  higher  plants,  there  is  less \nevidence, but we propose a CLENH3 of 3 \u00b1 1 \u00b5g NH3 m-3 for herbaceous species.  There \nis insufficient evidence to provide a separate CLENH3 for forest trees, but the value of \n3 \u00b1 1 \u00b5g NH3  m-3 is likely to exceed the empirical Critical Load for N deposition for \nmost forest ecosystems.\n1. Introduction\nThe Critical Level (CLE) for air concentration of a pollutant gas is defined as \u201cthe \nconcentration in the atmosphere above which direct adverse effects on receptors, such \nas  plants,  ecosystems  or  materials,  may  occur  according  to  present  knowledge\u201d \n(Posthumus, 1988). This definition means that when direct adverse effects of a gas are \nshown  to  occur  at  concentrations  below  the  accepted  Critical  Level,  \u2018present \nknowledge\u2019 must be updated and the Critical Level reviewed. In contrast, the Critical \nLoad  (CLO)  is  defined  as  \u201ca  quantitative  estimate  of  deposition  of  one  or  more \npollutants  below  which  significant  harmful  effects  on  specified  elements  of  the \nenvironment do not occur according to present knowledge\u201d (Posthumus, 1988). \nThe  distinction  between  the  definitions  is  important;  it  is  much  more  difficult  to \ndemonstrate the absence of an effect (to test the CLO) than the presence of an effect \n(to challenge the CLE). There is a more fundamental difference which is not included \nin the specific definitions given above, the inclusion of time frames. In general, CLEs \nare expressed in terms of threshold concentrations not to be exceeded over 1 hour, 1 \nday,  1 month or 1 year,  while the CLO is defined in terms of long-term potential \neffects  (several  decades)  (van der Eerden et  al.,  1991).  This  is  because CLOs are \nusually seen as operating through soil and water rather than directly on vegetation, \nwhereas  CLEs  refer  to  direct  effects  of  airborne  gases  on  the  vegetation.  The \ndifferences in applying CLEs and CLOs to nitrogen-containing pollutants (including \nammonia) are summarised in Table 1.\nCape et al.

There have been several  subsequent  reviews on the \neffects of NH3 on vegetation (Fangmeier et al., 1994, Krupa, 2003, van der Eerden et \nal., 1994, WHO, 1997). The issues involved in addressing the CLENH3 and highlighted \nin the review articles have been summarised (Cape et al., 2008) in the proceedings of \na workshop held in Edinburgh in December 2006 under the auspices of the United \nNations  Economic  Commission  for  Europe  (UNECE)  (Sutton  et  al.,  2008a).  This \npaper presents the rationale for reassessing the concept of a CLENH3, including the \nprocedures used to establish the threshold concentration at which effects are observed, \nthen examines the recent evidence for effects of NH3 on vegetation at concentrations \nbelow  the  original  annual  CLENH3 of  8  \u00b5g  m-3,  leading  to  conclusions  and \nrecommendations for new CLENH3 for sensitive vegetation types.\n2. Evidence for reassessing the CLENH3\nMuch of the debate over the effects of NH3 on vegetation arises over the distinction \nbetween direct effects of the gas on the above-ground vegetation, and the role of NH3 \nin acting as a source of dry-deposited nitrogen (N) to the soil or substrate, adding to \nthe CLO for N. In practice, the current annual CLENH3 of 8 \u00b5g m-3 does not protect \nvegetation in Europe because the CLO for N deposition would be exceeded in most \necosystems from the dry deposition of NH3 long before any direct effects would be \nexpected to occur on the basis of the current annual CLENH3 (Cape et al., 2008). In \nterms of setting CLEs, the critical question to be answered is whether (in terms of the \ndefinition above) a \u2018direct adverse effect on the receptor\u2019 of NH3 can be demonstrated \nas distinct from any contribution of NH3 to N deposition and soil-mediated effects. \nAlthough  changes  in  vegetation  properties  (e.g.  tissue  N  concentrations)  can  be \nobserved in response to NH3 (Sheppard et al., 2008b) there is generally no indication \nof the long-term consequences of such changes, whether adverse or otherwise. The \nevidence  presented  below  is  therefore  derived  from  field-based  observations  of \nchanges  in  populations  of  vegetation,  where the  evidence  for  an  adverse effect  is \ndemonstrated in terms of the loss of one or more species from a community, or radical \nchanges  in  the  proportions  of  species  in  a  community.  This  is  a  very  different \nCape et al. Ammonia Critical Level 2 of 11\nPublished as Environmental Pollution 157, 1033-1037 (2009)    doi:10.1016\/j.envpol.2008.09.049\napproach from that used in the initial setting of the CLENH3, which made extensive use \nof laboratory experiments on plants, often species with a high N demand, growing as \nsingle  species  or  cultivars  in  monocultures  at  constant  NH3 concentrations \n(Posthumus, 1988). \nIn deriving a CLENH3 from field observations, the causal relation of the exposure with \nan ecologically relevant end-point should be clear and quantified. Field observations \nalso  can  include  the  interactions  (in  terms  of  effects)  between NH3 exposure  and \nenvironmental conditions. There is evidence of enhanced sensitivity of plants to NH3 \nduring  drought  and cold,  and  vegetation  may become more  sensitive  to  insect  or \npathogen attack, or to strong winds after exposure to NH3 (Sheppard et al., 2008b, van \nder Eerden et al., 1991, van der Eerden et al., 2008). However, the field observations \nused  to  derive  the  CLENH3 will  not  have  encompassed  the  full  range  of  possible \nenvironmental  conditions.  Consequently,  exceedance  of  the  CLENH3 does  not \nguarantee that an effect will be observed, nor does it guarantee that no effect will be \nobserved in the presence of particular environmental stresses. Interactions with other \ngaseous  pollutants  are  also  poorly  understood.  There  is  experimental  evidence  of \nincreased  deposition  rates  of  SO2 in  response to  NH3 (Cape  et  al.,  1995),  and  of \nincreased NH3 deposition in response to SO2 (Shaw and McLeod, 1995). However, \ninteraction with SO2 might be expected to lead to increased deposition to external leaf \nsurfaces,  and localised depletion of gas-phase NH3 near stomata,  thereby reducing \ninternal uptake and NH3 effects.\nMuch, but not all, of the evidence presented here is derived from observations made \ndownwind  of  large  intensive  animal  production  units,  which  are  the  major  point \nsources  of  NH3 in  the  landscape.  Consequently,  we need to  demonstrate  that  the \ncausal agent in any effects is likely to be NH3 rather than another material emitted \nfrom such  sources.  Corroborative  evidence  will  be  given  from a  long-term  field \nfumigation study of an ombrotrophic bog which used pure NH3 (Leith et al., 2004). In \nall cases, the evidence is supported by measurements of NH3 concentrations at the \nsites of interest.\nEmissions  from intensive  livestock  rearing  units  contain  a  cocktail  of  compounds \nincluding  NH3,  carbon dioxide,  gaseous  amines  and particles  containing  nutrients, \nincluding nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. It is possible that nutrient-containing \nparticles (dust) could play a part in any observed effects on vegetation. However, the \nspatial pattern of dust deposition to the landscape is rather different from that for NH3; \nlarge  particles  (>  10-6 m  diameter)  deposit  rapidly,  within  a  few  tens  of  metres, \nwhereas sub-micron particles are inefficiently scavenged by vegetation and may be \ndispersed over tens or even hundreds of km (Pryor et al., 2008). Ammonia, however, \nis likely to have effects up to a few hundred metres downwind, depending on the size \nof the source (Pitcairn et al., 2002). CO2 is emitted in large quantities in co-occurrence \nwith NH3, but again its impact on the NH3 effect is probably negligible (Perez-Soba et \nal., 1994). Wet N deposition is unlikely to change markedly over short distances from \nthe  source;  any  increases  in  N  deposition  measured  in  throughfall  close  to  point \nsources are most likely attributable to the removal of soluble dry deposition (mostly \nNH3)  from plant  surfaces  (Cape et  al.,  1995)  rather  than  direct  incorporation  into \nfalling rain. The evidence presented below relies strongly on observations of lichen \nand  bryophyte  communities  in  response  to  measured  NH3 concentrations.  These \nCape et al. Ammonia Critical Level 3 of 11\nPublished as Environmental Pollution 157, 1033-1037 (2009)    doi:10.1016\/j.envpol.2008.09.049\ncommunities are least likely to be influenced by N supply from the substrate,  and \ntherefore are good indicators of a direct effect of NH3 in the gas phase.\n3. Procedures for deriving a CLE from an exposure-response relationship\nIn order to establish a CLE from field observations, the main difficulty is to establish \nan appropriate background exposure which is below the presumed \u2018no observed effect \nconcentration\u2019 (NOEC). Air concentrations in remote rural areas of Europe are well \nbelow 1 \u03bcg NH3 m-3, and, given the relatively short transport distance of gaseous NH3 \nin the atmosphere (tens rather than hundreds of km) may be assumed to be close to a \ntrue \u2018background\u2019. However, for many regions of Europe the regional \u2018background\u2019 \nconcentration may be several  \u03bcg NH3 m-3,  and changes in plant communities  may \nhave already occurred many decades ago. For those regions \u2018background\u2019 conditions \nmay have to relate to the 19th century rather than to any currently available. There is \ndocumented  evidence,  for  example,  of  the  loss  of  cyanobacterial  lichens  in  the \nNetherlands over the past century (WHO, 1997). This problem also arose with some \nof the early experimental approaches to determining NOECs, where the \u2018control\u2019 NH3 \nconcentration was several \u03bcg NH3 m-3 (van der Eerden et al., 1991).\nWe therefore need to establish, for any given location where vegetation is exposed to \na source of NH3, the point at which significant changes can be observed. The word \n\u2018significant\u2019 refers to both ecological and statistical significance. Responses in terms \nof  growth,  vitality,  reproductive  fitness,  competitive  ability,  shifts  in  species \ncomposition  etc.  can be regarded as having  ecological significance.  But  for  some \nother responses to exposure to NH3, such as enhanced foliar contents of N, arginine or \nNH4+, Glutathione synthetase activity etc., the relationships with ecological end points \nand their dependence on environmental conditions are still  insufficiently quantified \neven at the species level for them to be used directly as a basis for setting CLEs. In \nstatistical terms, \u2018significant\u2019 means that the measurement exceeds the \u2018background\u2019 \nvalue,  and has  only a  small  probability  (e.g.  <5%) of  falling  within the range of \npossible values regarded as \u2018background\u2019 \u2013 this depends  inter alia on the inherent \nuncertainty of the measurement method and the spatial (and temporal) variability of \nthe measured vegetation. In some cases the exposure\/response relationship shows a \nclear  break  point  -  the  point  above  which  the  response  deviates  from the  values \nobserved at low concentrations - and continues to increase in response to increasing \nconcentrations. However, for most of the new information presented here we do not \nknow the true \u2018background\u2019 or \u2018no-effect\u2019 concentration, and so have had to rely on a \nstatistical  procedure  to  identify  the  point  at  which  an  effect  is  detectable  that  is \nstatistically  significantly  different  from that  observed  at  the  lowest  concentrations \nobserved at a given field site. \nThe  method  used  to  identify  the  apparent  NOEC  is  illustrated  in  Figure  1.  The \nequation of the line that  best fits the response data in terms of the measured NH3 \nconcentration  was  established  by  means  of  a  least-squares  analysis.  The  95% \nconfidence limits for the relationship can than be calculated. The upper 95% curve at \nthe lowest exposure concentration estimates the largest value of the response variable \nthat  falls  within the local  \u2018background\u2019 range (the lowest  concentration  measured; \npoint A in Figure 1). If this response value is extended to higher concentrations, the \npoint where it intersects the fitted curve (point B) indicates the lowest concentration \nthat yields a measurement value above the local \u2018background\u2019 (read from the x-axis at \npoint C). This limiting concentration (C) is then an indication of the NOEC obtained \nCape et al. Ammonia Critical Level 4 of 11\nPublished as Environmental Pollution 157, 1033-1037 (2009)    doi:10.1016\/j.envpol.2008.09.049\nfrom that data set. This procedure utilises all the information available (in fitting the \nrelationship) while focussing on the lower end of the exposure scale. A measure of the \nappropriateness of the sampling regime (number of samples at any location) can be \nascertained from the relationship between the spread of measurement data about the \nmean and the range of the fitted curve. In general, for the data available, either a linear \nor log-linear response curve has been used, although other forms of response (e.g. \nsigmoidal) could exist and be used in a similar fashion.\nThis approach is a pragmatic solution to situations where the true NOEC may already \nhave  been  exceeded  at  the  point  where  the  lowest  concentration  was  measured. \nConsequently,  the NOEC derived from this approach may be an overestimate. The \nexact  form  of  the  relationship  between  the  response  variable  and  the  NH3 \nconcentration  may be  uncertain,  because  of  the  paucity  of  sampling  points.  If  an \ninappropriate  response  function  is  fitted,  or  if  the  data  are  subject  to  large \nmeasurement uncertainties, then the 95% confidence intervals will tend to be wide, \nand the apparent NOEC will again be overestimated.  Consequently, the bias in this \nmethod  is  to  overestimate  the  NOEC.  Even  where  a  very  clear  and  well-fitted \nresponse  is  observed,  the  NOEC  obtained  is  specific  for  the  particular  site,  and \nincludes no \u2018safety factor\u2019 to allow for extrapolation to other sites or conditions, as \noften used in establishing toxicity thresholds in ecotoxicology.\nFigure 1.

Evidence for adverse effects below the CLENH3 of 1993\nThis  section  reviews  recent  experimental  and  observational  data  that  demonstrate \nmeasurable changes in vegetation, compared to \u2018background\u2019 conditions, which are \ndirectly attributable to (measured) exposure to NH3. Results from measurements on \nvegetation where the NH3 gas concentration has not been measured are not included \n(for example, studies where NH3 concentration was only indicated by quoting data \nrelative to distance from a point source), although they may have a bearing on the \nspatial range over which such effects can be observed.\n \nOne of the most comprehensive datasets is from Whim Bog (Sheppard et al., 2008a), \nreproduced  as  Figure  2,  where  the  tissue  %N  of  the  moss  Hypnum  jutlandicum \n(Holmen  and  Warncke)  is  plotted  in  response  to  long-term  average  NH3 \nconcentrations after 4.5 years exposure in the field-fumigation experiment at Whim \nBog, in south-east Scotland (Leith et al., 2004). In this case, the large number of data \npoints  clearly  shows  the  linear  response  to  a  logarithmic  increase  in  NH3 \nconcentration, and a calculated CLENH3, as defined above, of 0.8 \u03bcg NH3 m-3.\nFigure 2.   Increase in tissue N concentration of the moss  Hypnum jutlandicum in \nresponse  to  experimental  field-fumigation  with  NH3 after  4.5  years  of \ntreatment (data from Sheppard et al., 2008a).\nAlthough this example only shows a measurable response to NH3, which may not be \necologically significant, it illustrates the method using real field data, and shows that \nplants do respond to NH3 concentrations very much smaller than the current CLENH3. \nSimilar data have been reviewed and summarised elsewhere (Cape et al., 2008), and \nserve as corroborative evidence for NH3 effects at low concentrations, even though \nCape et al.

A more sensitive index, derived from the presence\/absence of \nnitrophobe  and  nitrophile  species  (Pitcairn  et  al.,  2006,  Wolseley  et  al.,  2006), \nsuggested that significant changes in species composition occurred at concentrations \nbetween 1 and 3 \u03bcg NH3 m-3. More recent data, derived from experiments in the UK, \nSwitzerland,  Portugal  and  Italy,  all  indicate  ecologically  significant  effects  in  the \nrange of 0.5 \u2013 4 \u03bcg NH3 m-3 (Frati et al., 2007, Pinho et al., 2008, Rihm et al., 2008, \nSutton et al., 2008b) . The results of the statistical approach described above to each \nof these datasets are shown in Table 2. Lichens and bryophytes represent the most \nsensitive types of vegetation to NH3.\nTable 2: Summary of NOECs of the impact of long-term exposure to NH3 on species \ncomposition  of  lichens  and  bryophytes.

Proposal for new CLEs\nThe data in Table 2 suggest that the current annual CLENH3 does not protect the most \nsensitive components of ecosystems,  namely lichens and bryophytes,  and probably \nalso  some  of  the  more  sensitive  higher  plant  species.  The  changes  in  species \ncomposition observed for ecosystems that contain lichens and\/or bryophytes suggest \nCape et al. Ammonia Critical Level 7 of 11\nPublished as Environmental Pollution 157, 1033-1037 (2009)    doi:10.1016\/j.envpol.2008.09.049\nthat  long-term exposure at  concentrations  lower than 8 \u03bcg NH3 m-3 would lead to \nchanges in species, and possibly species extinction. In this case, \u2018long-term\u2019 refers to \na period of several years, sufficient for such changes to occur. Based on the NOEC \ndata in Table 2, a long-term CLENH3 for these systems should be set at 1 \u00b5g NH3 m-3. \nFor higher plants, there is much less new information, but two studies indicate that the \ncurrent CLENH3 of 8 \u00b5g m-3 is too high as a long-term threshold for higher plants in \nnatural vegetation. \n(1) Changes in woodland ground flora downwind of an intensive animal unit in \nSW England suggest a threshold of 4 \u00b5g m-3 (Leith et al., 2005).\n(2)  Comparison  of  the  increasing  rate  of  death  of  Calluna  vulgaris at  a  field \nfumigation experiment in Scotland (Whim bog) with the death rate of the lichen \nCladonia spp.  indicates  consistently  that  Calluna death  occurs  at  a \nconcentration  2.2  times  that  at  which  Cladonia  is  killed  (Sheppard  et  al., \n2008a); this implies a \u2018no effect\u2019 concentration for Calluna of around 2 \u00b5g m-3. \nOn the basis of these results, we propose the long-term CLENH3 for higher plants as 3 \n\u00b5g NH3 m-3. Although data are sparse, it is likely that the  CLENH3 as defined above \nwould protect bogs, heathland, woodland ground flora and probably also oligotrophic \ngrassland, from NH3-driven shifts in species composition, and the potential for species \nextinctions. \nThere is too little experimental  information to propose a long-term CLENH3 for all \necosystems or habitats. However, the proposed long-term CLENH3 for higher plants is \nlikely to be no more restrictive than the existing CLO for most habitats,  based on \nestimating  the  contribution  of  3  \u00b5g  NH3 m-3  to  dry  deposition  of  N  in  most \necosystems. For example, typical values for the UK would be 15-20 kg N ha-1 y-1 for \nshort  vegetation,  and up to 30 kg N ha-1 y-1 for tall  vegetation,  in  addition to the \ndeposition of other N species (wet and dry).\n6.  Conclusions and recommendations\nThe current annual CLENH3 of 8 \u03bcg NH3 m-3 is of little practical use because it was not \ndefined in terms of sensitive ecosystems, and because it is not as precautionary as \nempirical  Nitrogen  Critical  Loads  for  most  of  the  semi-natural  habitat  types  of \nEurope. Clear evidence has emerged, especially from field studies in the UK, but also \nfrom  several  other  European  countries,  of  effects  of  NH3 on  vegetation  at \nconcentrations well below the current annual CLENH3. Based on that evidence, a long-\nterm CLENH3 of 1 \u03bcg NH3 m-3 can be assumed to be protective for biodiversity of most \nsensitive ecosystems. A long-term CLENH3 of 3 \u03bcg NH3 m-3 is probably protective for \nbiodiversity of systems if bryophytes and lichens are not included.\nDespite  the  progress  made  in  recent  years,  several  uncertainties  still  remain. \nAdditional  work  is  required  to  allow  inter-conversion  of  CLEs  and  CLOs.  In \nparticular, uncertainty exists as to the appropriate deposition velocities linking CLEs \nand CLOs for  climatic  zones  outside  the  western  maritime  conditions  of  western \nEurope, especially for colder and drier climates. As with the CLO, it is expected that \ninteractions with other plant stresses will modify the CLE, although there are few data \non the quantitative interaction with high and low temperatures or drought stress. There \nare some indications, for example, that cold and drought stress make  Calluna more \nsensitive to NH3 (Sheppard et al., 2008b). The presence of other pollutants may also \naffect the response of vegetation to NH3, particularly at low concentrations of NH3. \nThere are major gaps in our knowledge of the deposition behaviour and compensation \nCape et al. Ammonia Critical Level 8 of 11\nPublished as Environmental Pollution 157, 1033-1037 (2009)    doi:10.1016\/j.envpol.2008.09.049\npoints  of  NH3,  and  the  relative  importance  of  the  different  N  compounds  that \ncontribute to CLOs. \nWe recommend: \nthat the \u2018long-term\u2019 annual average Critical Level (CLENH3) for lichens, bryophytes, \nand for ecosystems in which they are important, be set at 1 \u03bcg NH3 m-3;\nthat the \u2018long-term\u2019 annual average Critical Level (CLENH3) for higher vegetation be \nset at 3 \u03bcg NH3 m-3, recognizing that this figure is more uncertain, and that it should \nbe expressed as a range of 2 \u2013 4 \u03bcg NH3 m-3\nIn defining the CLENH3 in terms of air concentrations, it is assumed that appropriate \nmethods  are  available  to  measure  NH3.  For  long-term averages,  passive  diffusion \nsamplers provide adequate precision and accuracy (Leith et al., 2004, Sutton et al., \n2001, Tang et al., 2001), but care must be taken with their deployment in the field. \nThe CLENH3 defined above are based on NH3 concentrations measured at a height of \n1-2 m above the vegetation surface. Where the surface is an important sink for NH3 \nthere will be marked vertical concentration gradients (Cape et al., 2008), so that the \nmeasurement height in relation to the CLENH3 becomes important, and should also be \nstandardized, for example at 1.5m above the surface of short vegetation. \nThe proposed CLENH3 are based on empirical evidence for responses of the sensitive \nspecies within a community.  Directly applicable quantitative information on causal \nrelations and on inter-species variation in sensitivity is still scarce. Deriving methods \nfor linking physiological and biochemical measurements on plants to observed shifts \nin  species  composition  would  greatly  assist  in  detailed  analysis  of  existing \ninformation. Ecosystem models that simulate N cycles and biomass production could \nbe  useful,  but  are  still  in  a  preliminary  state  of  development  for  the  purpose  of \nassessing CLENH3. \nReferences\nAshmore, M.R., Wilson, R.B.
