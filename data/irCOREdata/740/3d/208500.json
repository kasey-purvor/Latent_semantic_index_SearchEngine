Unfortunately, the two \nschools of thought do not collaborate much in their respective attempts to answer these \nand related questions. Instead, mutual neglect is the general rule. This paper tries to \nshow how regime theory can learn from the findings of the economic theory of interna-\ntional environmental cooperation and vice versa and how both can fruitfully learn from \neach other. An exploitation of mutual learning opportunities is likely to lead to a more \ncomprehensive understanding of international environmental cooperation and can ulti-\nmately result in better informed policy advice. \n \n1 \n1. Introduction  \nMany environmental problems are truly international or global. They cannot be tackled \nby a single country alone. Hence international cooperation is needed for a solution. But \nwhereas environmental policy can use the enforcing power that sovereign nation-states \nideally have within their territory, in general international environmental policy cannot \ntake recourse to a supra-national authority with enforcing powers. International envi-\nronmental cooperation has to be accomplished under anarchy. \nRegime theory has long since addressed the question of how cooperation can be \nachieved and sustained in a world divided into sovereign nation-states.1 It has done so \nwith respect to many issues, especially security, economics and finance, not merely the \nenvironment. Independently from regime theory and starting from around the early \n1990s a branch of international environmental economics that is called here the eco-\nnomic theory of international environmental cooperation has engaged in substantial re-\nsearch on the subject as well. It has tackled the question that has traditionally occupied \nregime theorists most: \u2018why does cooperation emerge in some cases and not in others?\u20192 \nUnfortunately, the regime theory literature that focuses on the environment is not in-\nspired by the results from this research. Similarly, the economic literature on interna-\ntional environmental cooperation is to a great extent ignorant of the contributions from \nregime theory and does not consider how it could benefit from a better understanding of \nits findings. \n                                                 \n \n I would like to thank three anonymous referees for helpful comments. \n1\n For an overview, see, for example, Haggard and Simmons 1987 and Hasenclever, Mayer and Rittber-\nger 1996. \n2\n Oye 1985b, p. 1. \n2 \nIndicative of this mutual neglect is that the works of Scott Barrett and Carlo Carraro \n\u2014 presumably the most prominent representatives of the economic theory of interna-\ntional environmental cooperation \u2014 are hardly cited in any paper from regime theory. \nUsually, these papers do not mention or take any notice of the major results from the \neconomic theory of international environmental cooperation. On the other hand, some of \nthe papers of the economic theory of international environmental cooperation do cite \ncontributions from regime theory.3 However, reference is often cursory only and major \nresults from regime theory are only occasionally integrated into model building. Fur-\nthermore, that papers from regime theory are cited in the economic literature of interna-\ntional environmental cooperation is the exception rather than the rule. Indicative of this \nneglect is Carraro\u2019s suggestion that \u2018the idea of \u2018\u2018issue linkage\u2019\u2019 was originally proposed \nby Folmer et al. (1993) and Cesar and de Zeeuw (1996) to solve the problem of asym-\nmetries among countries\u20194, when this proposition actually goes back to early contribu-\ntions from regime theory and negotiation theory.5 \nIn the next two sections, I show how regime theory could benefit from a better under-\nstanding of the basic findings from the economic theory of international environmental \ncooperation and vice versa. Then several examples are provided on how the two schools \nof thought could fruitfully engage in mutual learning from each other in order to achieve \ninternational environmental cooperation that is \u2018wider\u2019 and \u2018deeper\u2019.6 \n                                                 \n3\n For example, Cesar 1994; Cesar and de Zeeuw 1996; Batabyal 1996; Helm 1998; Ecchia and Mariotti \n1998, Barrett 1999. \n4\n Carraro 1997, p. 9. \n5\n See, in particular, Ikl\u00e9 1964; Tollison and Willett 1979; Haas 1980; Sebenius 1983. \n6\n International environmental cooperation is defined here to be \u2018wider\u2019 if it includes more countries \nwith responsibility for the environmental problem. It is defined here to be \u2018deeper\u2019 if it increases the \n3 \nOran R. Young praises the returns from inter-disciplinary research in international af-\nfairs in suggesting that \u2018we have entered a period of profound change in our thinking \nabout governance in international society that offers an exciting new research agenda for \nstudents of international affairs and an opportunity to bridge the gap that has long sepa-\nrated the main streams of research in the fields of international relations, international \nlaw, and political science.\u20197 Young does not include the economic theory of interna-\ntional environmental cooperation. One possible reason might be that there still exists a \ngap between the fields he mentions and the economic theory of international environ-\nmental cooperation. In a nutshell, it is the aim of this paper to convince readers that it is \nworth while closing this gap. \n \n \n2. Learning from the economic theory of international environmental cooperation \nIt would be beyond the scope of this paper to provide a full sketch of the economic the-\nory of international environmental cooperation here. Instead, I shall concentrate on those \nresults that might be of special interest to scholars of regime theory. One of the major \ncontributions of the economic theory of international environmental cooperation has \nbeen an elaboration of what the absence of a central state authority in international af-\nfairs implies for the scope and depth of cooperation. \nBefore I come to this it seems appropriate, however, to explicate the assumptions on \nwhich the economic theory of international cooperation is based upon. Arguably, four of \nits assumptions are the most important ones: first, it is utilitarian in that it assumes that \n                                                                                                                                               \ndifference between the net benefits achieved by cooperation relative to the net benefits without such \ncooperation. \n7\n Young 1994, p. 12. \n4 \nall aspects of decision-making can be captured by utility-relevant costs and benefits and \nthat agents maximise a utility function; second, it assumes that agents decide rationally, \ntaking into account all available information; third, if it applies game theoretic analysis, \nwhich it often does, it assumes that there is a unitary actor who, fourth, is faced with a \nwell specified payoff matrix. Clearly, these assumptions are rather restrictive. However, \nthey are often justified in order to construct a tractable model that results in testable \npropositions. As in other areas of the field, economists have never been very impressed \nby the low degree of realism of its assumptions as long as its propositions have per-\nformed well in tests. We will now look at some of the propositions the economic theory \nof international environmental cooperation has arrived at. In the next section, we will \nsee, however, that at times the low degree of realism of its assumptions has led to sig-\nnificant shortcomings in its propositions. \n \nSELF-ENFORCEMENT AND RENEGOTIATION-PROOFNESS. \nThe economic theory of international environmental cooperation has taken the idea of \n\u2018cooperation under anarchy\u20198 very seriously and has developed the concepts of self-\nenforcing and renegotiation-proof agreements.9 What does this mean? As regards most \ninternational environmental problems the affected countries are confronted with a basic \nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma, in the following sense: the countries have an interest in reducing \nemissions that give rise to the problem and all countries are better off with international \nenvironmental cooperation, but each and every one of them also has an incentive to free-\nride on the others\u2019 efforts and to enjoy the benefits of abatement without incurring any \n                                                 \n8\n Oye 1985a. \n5 \ncosts of emission reduction. Therefore international agreements normally have to deter \nexternal free-riding, that is, they have to deter countries that would benefit from emis-\nsion reduction from not signing up to the agreement and staying outside. Equally, they \nhave to deter internal free-riding, that is, they have to deter signatory countries from not \ncomplying with the requirements of the agreement. What is important is that the mecha-\nnism employed to achieve deterrence has to be self-enforcing in the sense that a recourse \nto an external enforcement agency is not feasible: No country can be forced to sign an \nagreement and signatories cannot be forced to comply with the agreement. \nThere exist many mechanisms that could potentially achieve such deterrence. Most of \nthem, such as trade and other economic sanctions as well as a refusal to cooperate in \nother issue areas, depend on what has become known as issue linkage \u2013  a topic to \nwhich I will come back later on. Assuming for the moment that issue linkage is impos-\nsible or undesirable for whatever reason, then the only variable left to a country is the \namount of pollution it emits. Hence, the only mechanism left is to threaten not to under-\ntake any emission reduction in order to deter external free-riding or to decrease emis-\nsions by less than required by the agreement in order to punish non-compliant countries \nand to deter internal free-riding. This threat has to be credible in the sense that it is in \nthe interest of the threatening country (or countries) to actually execute the threat when-\never other countries try to free-ride. In other words, a threat cannot be credible if a coun-\ntry is worse off after executing the threat than it would be without execution. Non-\ncredible threats cannot deter because potential free riders will anticipate that they could \nget away with free-riding without being punished. Moreover, an agreement which estab-\n                                                                                                                                               \n9\n The major contributions are Barrett 1990, 1991, 1994a, 1994b, 1997a, 1997b; Carraro and Siniscalco \n1993; Botteon and Carraro 1997; Endres and Finus 1998; Finus and Rundshagen 1998a, 1998b. But \nsee also the references in other notes further below. \n6 \nlishes such a mechanism to deter free-riding has to be renegotiation-proof. This means \nthat the threat has to be credible also in the sense that the threatening country (or coun-\ntries) must be better off actually executing the threat than refraining from execution and \nrenegotiating a new agreement with the free-riding country (or countries). Agreements \nthat are not renegotiation-proof cannot deter because potential free riders will anticipate \nthat they could strike another deal after free-riding and could therefore get away without \nbeing punished. \nThe concept of renegotiation-proofness is more relevant and significant than might \nbe clear at first sight. The suggestion that cooperation under anarchy is possible is often \nimplicitly or explicitly based on the Folk Theorem from game theory, which implies that \nfull cooperation in an infinite or not obviously finite Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma can be sus-\ntained as a subgame perfect equilibrium if the discount rate is \u2018sufficiently small\u2019 (the \nshadow of the future is \u2018sufficiently long\u2019).10 One prominent supergame strategy that can \nachieve full cooperation as a subgame perfect equilibrium is the so-called trigger strat-\negy. In a two-players game the trigger strategy is defined as follows: start with coopera-\ntion and continue cooperation until the other player defects after which defect forever. \nThe problem with this and many other strategies is that they are not credible because \nthey are not renegotiation-proof. The player who is punished by \u2018defection forever\u2019 has \nan incentive to suggest to the punisher to forget about the past and to start mutual coop-\neration anew. The punisher itself has an incentive as well to let bygones be bygones and \nto refrain from punishing forever. Hence the trigger strategy is vulnerable to renegotia-\ntion and cannot achieve mutual cooperation in a repeated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game. \nThe players cannot get rid of the incentives for renegotiation because they cannot credi-\nbly commit to executing the \u2018defect forever\u2019 threat. Renegotiation-proof equilibria are \n                                                 \n10\n See, for example, Axelrod (1984). \n7 \nonly a subset of subgame perfect equilibria, hence not all subgame perfect equilibria can \nbe sustained via renegotiation-proof supergame strategies. \nRenegotiation-proofness is quite a far-reaching requirement. Not only does it rule out \ncertain supergame-strategies, it also rules out other proposals on how to promote coop-\neration. Black, Levi and Meza, for example, have shown how a minimum participation \nclause in international agreements can in principle induce more countries to join the \nagreement.11 In their model, there are only two options: either at least as many countries \nsign the agreement as specified by the minimum participation clause or the agreement \nnever comes into effect. This mechanism promotes participation as each country has to \nbalance the benefits from free-riding against the benefits forgone if it does not sign the \nagreement and thereby contributes to increasing the likelihood that cooperation is inhib-\nited once and for ever. Also, the clause assures each participating country that at least as \nmany other countries will cooperate as required by minimum participation, which helps \nto reduce the concerns of the cooperating countries about widespread free-riding. How-\never, the problem with this device is that it is not renegotiation-proof. If the minimum \nnumber of countries for the agreement to come into effect is not achieved the first time, \nthe signatory countries can always renegotiate and lower the minimum participation \nclause. Alternatively, if the agreement does come into effect, the signatory countries \nhave an incentive to revert to free-riding ex post and to break the agreement after it has \ncome into effect. Indeed, the more successful the minimum participation clause initially \nwas in increasing the number of signatories, the greater the incentive for a potential free-\nrider to break it afterwards. \nThe economic theory of international environmental cooperation has examined the \nimplications on cooperation if countries are restricted to strategies that must be renego-\n                                                 \n11\n Black, Levi and Meza 1993. \n8 \ntiation-proof. If issue linkage is impossible or undesirable, then one basic result holds: a \nself-enforcing and renegotiation-proof agreement will either consist of only a small sub-\nset of affected countries or if many countries are parties to the agreement then the gains \nfrom cooperation relative to the non-cooperative equilibrium are very small. In other \nwords, large-scale cooperation will either not take place as only few countries sign the \nagreement or if it does take place it is virtually irrelevant as the agreed upon cooperation \nimproves only marginally on what would have been achieved by unilateral action in the \nabsence of the agreement. Cooperation is either narrow (instead of wide) or shallow \n(instead of deep).12 \nThis result leads us to pessimistic expectations about a solution to an environmental \nproblem exactly for those problems, for which international cooperation is most needed. \nTo see this, note that for the case where the benefits from emission abatement are high \nand the costs are low (for example, ozone depleting substances), the basic result that \ncooperation will either be narrow or, if wide, will not be deep, does not matter much as \ncountries have big incentives to solve the problem unilaterally. The same might even be \ntrue if the benefits from abatement are relatively low as long as the costs are low as well. \nSimilarly, for the case where the benefits from abatement are low and the costs are high, \nthe basic result from the economic theory of international environmental cooperation \ndoes not matter much as even the full cooperative outcome would not do much about \nthe environmental problem due to high costs. The case where the basic result is really \nrelevant is the one where benefits from abatement are high, but so are costs (for exam-\n                                                 \n12\n Cooperation can be wider and deeper if emission abatement is characterised by fixed costs, so that \naverage costs are falling over a certain range of abatement, or if emission abatement creates positive \ntechnological externalities, so that abatement by one country reduces the abatement costs by other \ncountries \u2014 see Heal 1994. \n9 \nple, greenhouse gas emissions). These are exactly the cases where a solution to the envi-\nronmental problem would demand wide and deep cooperation most.13 \nThe intuitive reason for this most basic result of the economic theory of international \nenvironmental cooperation is as follows: In order to deter free-riding, an agreement \nmust specify that the non free-riding countries increase their emissions relative to an \nagreement without free-riding in order to punish free-riders for not decreasing their \nemissions at all (external free-riding) or by not as much as requested by the agreement \n(internal free-riding). In order to deter, the damage to the potential free-rider caused by \nthe increase in emissions must be greater than the potential benefit from free-riding. The \nwider and deeper cooperation is, the higher is the benefit from free-riding so that the \ndamage to the potential free-rider must also increase in order to deter free-riding. The \nproblem is, however, that the bigger is the damage to the potential free-rider, the bigger \nis the damage to the punishing countries themselves as well. This self-inflicted damage \ndue to the emission increase limits the punishment that is available for free-rider deter-\nrence. It must not hurt the punishing countries more than the damage caused by the free-\nriding. Otherwise it will not be credible as the potential free-rider knows that it is not in \nthe best interest of the punishing countries to execute the punishment. \nWhat is more, there must not exist any incentive for the punishing countries and the \nfree-riders to renegotiate the agreement and strike another deal. For this condition to \nhold, the punishment must not be very high or else the damage to the free-riding country \nis big as is its incentive to renegotiate another agreement. Because of these twin reasons \nthe credible punishment available cannot be very substantial which means that it cannot \ndeter much free-riding. Because external free-riding can be deterred only to a small ex-\ntent, free-riding is ubiquitous and the number of countries participating in an agreement \n                                                 \n13\n Barrett 1991, pp. 14f. \n10 \nis small. Alternatively, because internal free-riding can be deterred only to a small ex-\ntent, then the agreement cannot improve much relative to the non-cooperative equilib-\nrium in order to keep the incentives for non-compliance small, if the number of signato-\nries is large. \nThe consequences of the requirements of self-enforcement and renegotiation-\nproofness are challenging for regime theory with its belief in the possibility of wide and \ndeep cooperation in spite of anarchy. But is it of any real-world relevance? This is a \nquestion that is difficult to answer. How do we know whether the gains from coopera-\ntion are small relative to the non-cooperative equilibrium? The fact that cooperation \nexists means that we cannot directly observe what the outcome would be without coop-\neration. And how do we know what the full cooperative outcome would look like? The \nfew studies that have tried to gain evidence on this question in applying econometric \ntechniques have supported the basic finding of the economic theory of international en-\nvironmental cooperation: James C. Murdoch and Todd Sandler suggest that the Mont-\nreal-Protocol does not reduce ozone damaging chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by much \nmore than the major producers would have reduced unilaterally out of their own selfish \ninterest.14 Hence, the Montreal Protocol \u2018may be more symbolic than a true instance of a \ncooperative equilibrium, since nations\u2019 CFC reductions prior to the treaty taking effect \nappear to fit the predictions of a single-shot Nash equilibrium\u2019.15 Similarly, Murdoch, \nSandler and Keith Sargent find that for the Helsinki-Protocol limiting SO2-emissions \nand for the Sofia-Protocol limiting NOx-emissions the cooperative gains are small rela-\n                                                 \n14\n Murdoch and Sandler 1997. \n15\n ibid., pp. 332f. \n11 \ntive to the non-cooperative equilibrium: \u2018...nations achieved emission reduction levels \nand then drafted the treaty with these levels as targets.\u201916  \n \nLEAKAGE. Another major topic where regime theory could learn from the economic \ntheory of international environmental cooperation is the aspect of leakage and how leak-\nage exacerbates the problems of free-riding. Leakage describes the phenomenon that a \ndecrease in emissions by the participants to an agreement is counter-acted by an increase \nof emissions by non-members. Such an increase can be a deliberate decision by the free-\nriding countries. Because the decrease in emissions by the participants lowers the mar-\nginal social damage of emissions by the non-participants their non-cooperative Nash \nequilibrium emissions rise. These non-members will therefore usually find it in their \nown best interest to deliberately increase emissions. However, this is just part of the \nstory. The other reasons why emissions of non-participants might rise are more subtle \nand can hardly be traced back to a deliberate policy by these countries to exploit the \nemissions reductions of others. To understand this point, take the example of carbon \ndioxide emissions. If a sub-set of all countries agrees on limiting their carbon dioxide \nemissions, then production of carbon-intensive goods and services becomes relatively \nmore expensive in these countries. Comparative advantage in these goods and services \nshifts to the non-participating countries who increase their production of carbon-\nintensive goods and services. Similarly, some especially carbon-intensive industries \nmight migrate from signatory to non-signatory countries. Also, the reduction in demand \nfor fossil fuels due to the limitation of carbon dioxide emissions by the participants to \nthe agreement will lower world fossil fuel prices which increases demand for fossil fuels \nin non-member countries. All of these feedback mechanisms lead to an increase of \n                                                 \n16\n Murdoch, Sandler and Sargent 1997, p. 298. \n12 \nemissions by non-participants quite involuntarily, that is, without the participating coun-\ntries being able to blame the non-members for deliberately exploiting their emission \nreductions. How significant leakage would be depends on the underlying assumptions \nabout how many countries form an agreement, reduce emissions by how much and use \nwhich instrument for emission reductions. Econometric estimates show that leakage \ncould be anywhere between around 5% and 30%.17 In any case, leakage can potentially \nbe a quite important obstacle for international environmental agreements and it would \ncertainly pay regime theory to give more attention to the ways in which the benefits of \ninternational environmental cooperation can leak away. \nOne problem is how to distinguish leakage that is due to price effects and shifts in \ncomparative advantage from free-riding proper. Another problem is that leakage is very \nhard to avoid. Peter Bohm suggests that participating countries could purchase or lease \nfossil fuel deposits in order to neutralise the price effects from lower demand, but this \nsuggestion seems to be utterly unrealistic.18 Another theoretical possibility is to restrict \nimports of carbon-intensive goods from non-participating countries. As this would af-\nfect a wide range of goods, it would almost certainly clash with international trade re-\ngimes such as the World Trade Organization, however, and is therefore not likely to be \nemployed. \nOn the other hand, the existence of substantial leakage can also induce the formation \nof international environmental agreements with a large number of participating coun-\ntries. This is because, all other things equal, the return from large-scale cooperation is \nhigher if leakage is a substantial problem. These two countervailing effects of leakage \n                                                 \n17\n For an overview, see Smith 1998. \n18\n Bohm 1993. \n13 \ncan imply that two equilibria exist: one with few and one with very many participating \ncountries.19 \n \nSTRATEGIC INCENTIVES. More generally, regime theory could learn from the eco-\nnomic theory of international environmental cooperation about the strategic effects of \ncertain measures that appear to promote cooperation, but might indeed very well reduce \ncooperation. To give an example: side-payments and joint implementation measures are \noften thought of as being beneficial for international cooperation as they induce non-\nparticipant countries to engage in some form of emission reduction as well. The model \nof Michael Hoel and Kerstin Schneider suggest, however, that the very existence of \nthese measures can represent a very strong strategic incentive for potential participants \nto stay out of the agreement so that they have to be \u2018bought into it\u2019 later on.20 Perversely, \nthese unintended strategic side-effects can more than compensate for any cooperation \ngains side-payments and joint implementation measures can bring about. Furthermore, \nthe model of Franz Wirl, Claus Huber and I.O. Walker shows that due to strategic incen-\ntives in joint implementation, cheating on both sides can be pervasive and the emission \nreductions achieved via joint implementation can be largely faked rather than real.21 \n \n                                                 \n19\n See Botteon and Carraro 1997. \n20\n Hoel and Schneider 1997. \n21\n Wirl, Huber and Walker 1998. \n14 \n3. Learning from regime theory \nRegime theory covers a wide and broad range of approaches towards the study of inter-\nnational regimes.22 It would be impossible to provide a complete overview here.23 In-\nstead I shall illustrate for a number of topics how the economic theory of international \nenvironmental cooperation could learn from regime theory. \nThe first issue has to do with the coordinating function of regimes. Many scholars of \nthe economic theory of international environmental cooperation point out that their \nmodels are characterised by multiple equilibria that differ on how much cooperation is \nachieved and who gains by how much relative to others.24 On this they could learn from \nregime theory on how regimes create \u2018bargaining forums\u201925 to coordinate the selection \nof certain equilibria.26 Without explicitly referring to the regime theory literature, Mich-\nele Botteon and Carraro acknowledge the beneficial role regimes can play in stating that \n\u2018how to move from one equilibrium to the other is a matter of coordination, which de-\nmands for new international institutions\u2019.27 Similarly, Engelbert J. Dockner and Ngo \n                                                 \n22\n Regimes should be understood here as \u2018implicit or explicit principles, norms, rules, and decision-\nmaking procedures around which actors\u2019 expectations converge in a given area of international rela-\ntions\u2019 (Krasner 1983, p. 2), which is the standard definition of regimes. \n23\n See Haggard and Simmons 1987 and Hasenclever, Mayer and Rittberger 1996 for an overview of \nregime theory in general. For special reference to environmental regimes, see Young and von Moltke \n1994 and Young 1998. \n24\n See, for example, M\u00e4ler 1991, p. 84f; Dockner and Long 1993, p. 15; Hoel and Schneider, p. 155; \nBotteon and Carraro 1997, p. 17. This point is also observed by regime theorists who employ game \ntheory in their analysis. See, for example, Niou and Ordeshook 1994, p. 220; Kydd and Snidal 1995. \n25\n Levy, Keohane and Haas 1993, p. 40. \n26\n Compare Morrow 1994. At least some economists seem to recognise this function of regimes at last, \nsee Ecchia and Mariotti 1998. \n27\n Botteon and Carraro 1997, p. 17. \n15 \nVan Long implicitly refer to regimes when they state that \u2018our results suggest that there \nare good reasons for negotiators to meet and communicate even if no contracts can be \nexpected to be signed\u2019 and that \u2018presumably preplay negotiations would lead to the \nchoice of the most efficient strategy pair\u2019.28 \u2018Cheap talk\u2019, often denounced by econo-\nmists as irrelevant because of its non-binding character,29 becomes important once the \nexistence of multiple equilibria and the necessity of a device for equilibrium selection is \nfully acknowledged. However, the presumption that the most efficient strategy pair will \nbe chosen might well be wrong. The economic theory of international environmental \ncooperation could learn from regime theory that countries very often pay overwhelming \nattention to clearly perceivable distributional issues and are only little concerned about \nthe rather abstract notion of Pareto-efficiency that dominates economic reasoning.30 \nMost of the relevant literature of the economic theory of international environmental \ncooperation implicitly assumes that international environmental agreements will end up \non the Pareto-efficient contract curve. Regime theory in general does not share this mis-\nguided assumption. \nThe selection among different equilibria resembles a coordination game for which \nmany of the traditional findings from the simple Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma literature are not \nvalid anymore. As distributional issues come to the forefront, a long shadow of the fu-\nture can have a detrimental rather than beneficial effect on cooperation as it pays to hold \nout longer in the hope to reach a distributionally more favourable equilibrium for one-\n                                                 \n28\n Dockner and Long 1993, pp. 15 and 24. Characteristically for many contributions from the economic \ntheory of international environmental cooperation, the papers by Botteon and Carraro and by Dockner \nand Long do not contain a single reference to the regime theory literature. \n29\n Which is exactly the reason why it is called \u2018cheap\u2019. \n30\n Young 1989, pp. 368f. \n16 \nself.31 Connected to this point, the economic theory of international environmental co-\noperation could learn from realist regime theory to take into account that countries are \nconcerned about relative in addition to absolute gains and losses.32 Economics with its \npreoccupation with efficiency has not paid enough attention to relative distributional \nissues and has to make up on this respect. A state might refuse to cooperate if it expects \nthat its partners will gain relatively more from cooperation. Surely, what Joseph M. \nGrieco calls \u2018state positionality\u201933 plays more of a role in security matters than in envi-\nronmental issues, even though a good case can be made that states pay attention to rela-\ntive gains and losses as concerns natural resource exploitation and the costs of emission \nabatement.34 Also, Duncan Snidal has shown that if the number of states involved is \nlarge, relative gains maximisation will not constrain the scope for cooperation to a great \nextent.35 Nevertheless, it would pay economists to take state positionality into account in \nmodel building and examine how robust the results are. Similarly, economists have to \npay more attention to how power in international relations determines who is allowed to \nplay the game, who gets to move when and how power can be used to change the payoff \nmatrix of the game.36 \nMore generally, the economic theory of international environmental cooperation \ncould learn from the institutionally rich analysis of regime theory on the various func-\ntions regimes provide and how they foster international cooperation. Economists could \nprofit from a better understanding of how regimes can enlarge the shadow of the future \n                                                 \n31\n See Snidal 1985, p. 936; Fearon 1998. \n32\n Compare Grieco 1988. \n33\n ibid., p. 499. \n34\n List and Rittberger 1992, pp. 93f. \n35\n Snidal 1991a, 1991b. \n36\n Compare Krasner 1991. \n17 \nin making interaction more durable and more frequent37 and how earlier mutually ad-\nvantageous experience with regimes induces prospective partners to be more coopera-\ntive in the building of new regimes \u2014 an aspect that Keohane circumscribes as the repu-\ntational aspect of regimes.38 The analysis of the economic theory of international envi-\nronmental cooperation would be enriched by recognising how regimes provide ongoing \nnegotiating processes that reduce transaction costs39 and help making transfers and link-\nages by clustering issues40. The same holds true for a recognition of how regimes pro-\nvide monitoring and verification services41 as well as implementation review mecha-\nnisms42. It can learn from regime theory how important regimes can be in strengthening \nthe domestic capacity of weak governments to comply with an agreement via a transfer \nof technical assistance and general aid.43 \nThe economic theory of international environmental cooperation could also benefit \nfrom a better understanding of how important a participatory approach towards interna-\ntional agreement making and procedurally fair rules are for bringing about cooperation. \nFor example, substantially the same bargaining outcome that is accepted by a party if it \nfeels sufficiently involved in the bargaining process can be rejected if the party feels \n                                                 \n37\n Axelrod 1984, p. 129. \n38\n Keohane 1984, p. 94. \n39\n This beneficial aspect has to be balanced against the problem that an ongoing negotiation process \noften lets a considerable amount of time pass by until the environmental problem is eventually tackled \n(Susskind 1994, chapter 1). \n40\n Milner 1992. \n41\n Levy, Keohane and Haas 1993, pp. 402f. \n42\n Young and Demko 1996, p. 233. \n43\n Levy, Keohane and Haas 1993, p. 405. \n18 \ntreated unjustly.44 The importance of procedural fairness holds especially true when par-\nticipants, as David Lewis Feldman observes, \u2018do not bargain from pre-established posi-\ntions, but, in many cases, enter into negotiations precisely to learn more about a prob-\nlem\u2019.45 An understanding of this aspect will also allow the economic theory of interna-\ntional environmental cooperation to comprehend why at times individual leadership in \nnegotiations and an exogenous crisis or shock, such as a nuclear power accident or satel-\nlite pictures showing a hole in the ozone layer, are important in bringing about interna-\ntional cooperation.46 Connected to this, the economic theory of international environ-\nmental cooperation could learn from the weak cognitivist or epistemic community \nbranch of regime theory how important a consensus community of scientists can be for \nbringing about negotiations and shaping state actors\u2019 interests47 and how regimes help \nstates to re-evaluate their interests48. How international networks of scientists can serve \nas catalysts and facilitators for regime formation has mostly been ignored by the eco-\nnomic theory of international environmental cooperation. \nThe finding from Young and Gail Osherenko that states tend to agree on uncompli-\ncated formulas and across-the-board or equal relative emission cuts even if efficiency is \nsacrificed could teach economists that complicated formulas for the allocation of the \nburden of abatement such as those in the models of Parkash Chander and Henry \nTulkens, that can theoretically achieve efficiency, are hopelessly unrealistic and would \n                                                 \n44\n Young and Demko 1996, p. 232 and 238f. \n45\n Feldman 1991, p. 379. \n46\n Young and Osherenko 1995, pp. 230ff. \n47\n Young and Osherenko 1995, p. 237; Mayer, Rittberger and Z\u00fcrn 1995, p. 415. See, for example, Haas \n1989, 1990a, 1990b, 1992a, 1992b, 1995. \n48\n Levy, Keohane and Haas 1993, p. 398 Levy, Keohane and Haas 1993, p. 398. \n19 \nnever be agreed upon in real negotiations.49 As originally pointed out by Thomas C. \nSchelling, states look for \u2018focal points\u2019 or \u2018salient solutions\u2019 in international bargaining, \nnot for highly complex formulas.50 Some initial steps in building more realistic models \nhave already been undertaken. The models of Alfred Endres and Michael Finus and \nFinus and Bianca Rundshagen explicitly assume that players agree on uniform solutions \nfor all participants in a game of incomplete information.51 They rationalise this assump-\ntion in suggesting that uniform solutions appear to be \u2018fair\u2019 to all participants and have \nlow transaction costs as an agreement on differentiated solutions would take more time. \nAlso, the models assume that negotiating partners agree on the \u2018smallest common de-\nnominator\u2019 solution at the end of the bargaining process. This is because no country can \nbe forced to sign the agreement, hence the uniform solution cannot go beyond what the \n\u2018bottleneck country\u2019 is willing to do.52 Both assumptions are frequently observed char-\nacteristics of international environmental agreements and represent an important step \ntowards making the economic theory of international environmental cooperation con-\nform more with the reality of international bargaining on environmental issues. \nOne concrete example on how regime theory might contest some of the empirical \nevidence that proponents of the economic theory of international environmental coop-\neration invoke in support of their propositions is the already mentioned study by Mur-\ndoch and Sandler.53 From a regime theoretic perspective, this study suffers from at least \ntwo major shortcomings: first, even if the reductions agreed upon in the Montreal Proto-\n                                                 \n49\n Young and Osherenko 1995, p. 233; Chander and Tulkens 1995, 1997. \n50\n Schelling 1960. \n51\n Endres and Finus 1998; Finus and Rundshagen 1998b. \n52\n It is assumed that transfer payments are infeasible. \n53\n Murdoch and Sandler 1997. I am grateful to an anonymous referee to draw my attention to this exam-\nple. \n20 \ncol correspond with what Murdoch and Sandler predict as a Nash equilibrium, it might \nbe misleading to call these \u2018voluntary\u2019 as they might have been undertaken in anticipa-\ntion of the restraints an international environmental agreement such as the Montreal \nProtocol would impose on nation-states. Thus, Murdoch and Sandler are likely to under-\nestimate the importance of international negotiations for bringing about these emission \nreductions. Second, and connected to the last point, it seems inappropriate to only look \nat the Montreal Protocol without looking at its various amendments which made emis-\nsion reduction obligations more stringent. Even if the Montreal Protocol can be inter-\npreted as codifying emission reductions nation-states would have undertaken anyway, it \nis much more doubtful whether the same could be said of the more stringent amend-\nments to the Protocol that followed suit. \nAnother example is the similar finding in the already mentioned study by Murdoch, \nSandler and Sargent on the Helsinki and Sofia Protocols.54 If international environ-\nmental cooperation is not particularly deep here, this might have much more to do with \nthe fact that it brought together countries with hugely different value systems at or \nshortly after the height of East-West tensions rather than with the problems of self-\nenforcement and renegotiation-proofness. Given these differing value systems both Pro-\ntocols might therefore be interpreted as a very successful example of regime formation \nin the face of enormous obstacles to negotiation rather than as evidence that the re-\nquirements of self-enforcement and renegotiation-proofness will invariably prevent in-\nternational environmental cooperation from becoming deep. \n \n \n                                                 \n54\n Murdoch, Sandler and Sargent 1997. \n21 \n4. Achieving wide and deep cooperation: Prospects for mutual learning opportuni-\nties \nSo far I have tried to demonstrate how one school of thought can learn from the findings \nof the other. In this section, I shall present several examples for how regime theory and \nthe economic theory of international environmental cooperation could fruitfully learn \nfrom each other. All the topics that I refer to here are part of ongoing projects by either \nregime theory or the economic theory of international environmental cooperation. How-\never, it is the aim of this section to show how both streams of research might gain from \ncross fertilisation. \n \nCOMPLIANCE. One such example is the question of why states comply with interna-\ntional agreements and what this implies for the problem of free-riding. Abram Chayes \nand Antonia Handler Chayes have tried to show that non-compliance with the require-\nments of an agreement is the exception rather than the rule in the practice of interna-\ntional relations.55 If non-compliance occurs it is often due to insufficient managerial \ncapacity, rather than a deliberate decision to free-ride on others\u2019 efforts. Chayes and \nChayes conclude from their findings that the \u2018free rider problem has been overesti-\nmated\u2019.56 This conclusion is highly contested, however. George W. Downs, David M. \nRocke and Peter N. Barsoom have argued that the marginality of non-compliance is due \nto \u2018the fact that most treaties require states to make only modest departures from what \nthey would have done in the absence of an agreement\u2019.57 Their argument is strongly \nsupported by the basic result of the economic theory of international environmental co-\n                                                 \n55\n Chayes and Chayes 1995. \n56\n ibid., pp. 19f. \n57\n Downs, Rocke and Barsoom 1996, p. 380. \n22 \noperation, which clearly shows that free-riding is a great problem as it is the impotence \nto deter free-riding on a large scale that limits the gains to be achieved from coopera-\ntion. Once the agreement has been reached, free-riding is no longer a major problem, but \nif free-riding had not been such a major problem in the first instance, another agreement \nwith much deeper cooperation could have been reached. Indeed, because, implicitly and \nin effect, external free-riding is an extreme version of non-compliance, once free-riding \nhas been deterred, non-compliance is no longer of concern.58 Thus, the conclusion by \nChayes and Chayes does not follow from their findings if one takes the stage of agree-\nment making into account as well. On the other hand, the economic theory of interna-\ntional environmental cooperation could learn from regime theory that sometimes perfect \ncompliance by \u2018weak\u2019 governments is not even the outcome that \u2018strong\u2019 governments \nexpect. As Levy, Keohane and Haas observe, regime standards are often set higher than \nmany countries with weak environmental preferences either want to comply with or \ncountries with weak administrative capacity can comply with.59 This is because high \nregime standards serve other functions as well, such as generating political concern in \n\u2018weak countries\u2019 and setting normative goals for them, communicating the intensity of \npreferences among regime members and legitimating technical aid or outright transfer \npayments that might otherwise be denounced as bribes or blackmail. \n \nUNILATERAL ACTION. As another example for mutual learning opportunities, con-\nsider the issue of unilateral emission abatement by one country. Game theoretic models \nof Hoel and of Endres and Finus show how unilateral emission abatement by one coun-\ntry can be detrimental to the environment because it can lower the abatement incentives \n                                                 \n58\n See Barrett 1998a, pp. 328f.; 1998b, p. 36. \n59\n Levy, Keohane and Haas 1993, p. 404. \n23 \nof other countries in a potential future agreement.60 This result holds only true under \ncertain restrictive assumptions, however. For example, countries are supposed to know \nexactly their payoffs and to maximise their own payoff with the exception of the unilat-\nerally acting country. Regime theory could learn here from the economic theory of in-\nternational environmental cooperation about how important it is to trace the perverse \nstrategic effects a well-intended action can have under certain conditions. At the same \ntime, the economic theory of international environmental cooperation could learn from \nregime theory that these very same conditions that give rise to their model results need \nnot hold in reality. In real-world international bargaining, countries do not know their \nexact payoffs and unilateral action by one country can be regarded by potential partici-\npants to an agreement as a constructive, confidence building step towards regime build-\ning. Unilateral action can help overcome a deadlock in negotiations by pushing ahead \nand demonstrating that a country is credibly committed to cooperation and, possibly, \nalso by proving to potential partners to an agreement that emission abatement is less \nexpensive than commonly believed. \n \nRULES, NORMS, AND CONVENTIONS. Maybe the highest return from mutual \nlearning is likely to stem from exploring how the basic finding from the economic the-\nory of international environmental cooperation could be overcome. How can wide and \ndeep cooperation in international environmental affairs be achieved? This is the funda-\nmental question that has to be tackled. There is no convincing answer yet, but there are \nsome attempts to show how the problems of self-enforcement and renegotiation-\nproofness can be mitigated at least. \n                                                 \n60\n Hoel 1991; Endres and Finus 1998. \n24 \nSchmidt, for example, proposes that the deposition of securities at third parties \u2014 for \nexample, at international institutions \u2014 or the exchange of \u2018hostages\u2019 could help coun-\ntries making threats credible. The idea is that these deposits or hostages are automati-\ncally lost if countries do not execute their threat to punish free-riders. In principle, \nthreats that were not credible before can be made credible with such a device if the de-\nposit or hostage is appropriately specified. The problem with this proposal, however, is \nthat the deposit or the exchange of hostages is itself not renegotiation-proof. A country \nwhich stands to lose its deposit could always engage in negotiations with the agency \nholding the deposit to strike another deal and avoid the loss. Equally, countries can al-\nways engage in negotiations with each other to get their hostages back.61 \nAnother attempt derives from the idea that behaviour is not fully determined by util-\nity maximisation, but also governed by rules and norms. Hoel and Schneider show in a \ngame theoretic model how deeper cooperation is possible if countries are inhibited from \nfree-riding excessively because they follow the social norm and convention that free-\nriding is undesirable.62 \nYet another attempt sticks to the assumption of utility maximisation, but includes \nmore items in the utility function than usual. Carsten Schmidt, for example, uses the \nidea that countries might refrain from free-riding for fear of being blamed as opportunis-\ntic. In other words, the reputation of being regarded as a responsible member of the in-\nternational community of nation-states represents an important factor in the utility func-\ntion of state actors.63 But where do these norms and conventions come from and why do \nstates not simply break them if they run counter to their own selfish interests, as realism \n                                                 \n61\n Schmidt 1998, p. 22 \n62\n Hoel and Schneider 1997. \n63\n Schmidt 1998, p. 32. \n25 \nwould have it?64 Why do countries not want to be blamed as opportunistic? Here, re-\ngime theory can provide initial steps for a better understanding. Both Snidal and Litfin \nargue that once international regimes have come into existence, they gain, to some ex-\ntent, an independent life on their own.65 They change actors\u2019 expectations, they change \nthe rules of the game, they make actors\u2019 decisions transparent, they initiate further steps \nand push issues forward \u2014 in short, they start to constrain state behaviour. After the \nestablishing of regimes the states that created the regime are no longer free to do as they \nplease.66 States get accustomed to cooperation and successful interaction in one regime \nmakes the establishing of the next one more likely. The strong cognitivist branch of re-\ngime theory, as it is called by Andreas Hasenclever, Peter Mayer and Volker Rittber-\nger67, even argues that successful regime building induces the participating states to de-\nvelop a collective identity that helps them to sustain cooperation even in situations \nwhere one or the other state would otherwise defect.68 But we need to better understand \nhow these transformations come about and why sovereign nation-states are willing to \nagree in the first instance on mechanisms that constrain their very sovereignty later on. \nIn there lies the real challenge to both regime theory and the economic theory of interna-\ntional environmental cooperation individually and to both of them together. \n                                                 \n64\n Compare Bernauer 1995, p. 354. \n65\n Snidal 1996, p. 127; Litfin 1997, p. 181f. \n66\n The Montreal Protocol, for example, has a clause that allows a tightening of the agreement if it is \napproved by an overall two-third majority and a simple majority of both developed and developing \ncountries. The international whaling commission provides a similar example with its combination of \nmajority voting and the allowance for countries to object to certain decisions. \n67\n Hasenclever, Mayer and Rittberger 1996. \n68\n See, for example, Wendt 1992, p. 417; 1994, pp. 388-391. \n26 \nAnother promising way to mitigate the negative impact the requirements of self-\nenforcement and renegotiation-proofness have on the scope and depth of cooperation \ncomes through the idea that states follow to some extent considerations of fairness. \nFairness here means two things. First, players behave cooperatively if others behave \ncooperatively, even if, strictly speaking, it is in their selfish interest to free ride on oth-\ners\u2019 cooperation. This aspect means that the problem of free-riding is less pronounced \nthan if states were not concerned with fairness. Second, players are willing to punish \ndefectors, even if, strictly speaking, it is in their selfish interest to refrain from punish-\nment. This aspect means that free-riding can be deterred to a greater extent, as punish-\nment can be more severe than dictated by the selfish interest of the punisher. Certainly, \nconsiderations of fairness encounter limits. If the incentives to free ride become over-\nwhelming, then players defect even if the others maintain cooperation. Similarly, if the \nharm inflicted upon oneself due to punishing a defector becomes too big, the potential \npunisher has to let the defector get away without punishment. But if considerations of \nfairness play some role in international bargaining, then deeper cooperation becomes \npossible. This is confirmed by a model of Tim Jeppesen and Per Andersen who use the \npioneering work by Matthew Rabin.69 The challenge is to better understand why and to \nwhat extent states take considerations of fairness into account and what factors promote \nthese considerations as well as factors that lead to their disregard. \n \nISSUE LINKAGE. Another mechanism to promote cooperation \u2013 and one that has \nlong since been recognised \u2013 is issue linkage.70 Issue linkage strengthens the incentives \n                                                 \n69\n Jeppesen and Andersen 1998; Rabin 1993. \n70\n The pioneering contributions are Tollison and Willett 1979; Haas 1980; and Sebenius 1983. \n27 \nfor mutual cooperation by linking games with an asymmetric payoff structure.71 Issue \nlinkage functions best if one set of players has a strong interest in cooperation in one \nissue, but not in another one, whereas another set of players has the opposite preference \nstructure. Hence, in order to promote cooperation issue linkage depends on countries \nbeing asymmetric in their preferences and, in some sense, the more asymmetric coun-\ntries are the better are the prospects for issue linkage. The aspect just considered looks at \nissue linkage as a means to transform mutual cooperation into the common interest of \nall players \u2013 something that is often already implicitly assumed in regarding the problem \nof international environmental cooperation as a Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma.72 \nBut issue linkage can also be used if the underlying game is a Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma \nright from the start and it can mitigate the problems of self-enforcement and renegotia-\ntion-proofness for this game. Barrett shows how linking an international environmental \nagreement with trade can promote cooperation.73 Trade sanctions are a more credible \nthreat to deter free-riding than an increase in emissions because, according to Barrett, \ntrade sanctions mainly harm the free-rider, whereas the emission increase considerably \nharms the punisher as well.74 Hence, with trade sanctions free-riding can be deterred \n                                                 \n71\n See Folmer et al. 1993, p. 315. Cesar and de Zeeuw 1996 show how full cooperation can be achieved \nvia issue linkage even under the requirement of renegotiation-proofness. \n72\n Another mechanism to make mutual cooperation the interest of all affected parties is the outright \npayment of transfers. The record of international environmental agreements seems to suggest, how-\never, that countries prefer issue linkage to the payment of transfers. \n73\n Barrett 1997b. For an excellent discussion of economic instruments for sustaining international envi-\nronmental regimes more generally, see Heister et al. 1997. \n74\n A necessary condition is, however, that the trade sanctions are executed by a certain minimum number \nof countries and not just by one country alone (Barrett 1997b, p. 347). Indeed, cooperating countries \nthat fail to execute trade sanctions against free-riders might themselves face trade sanctions. \n28 \nmore effectively as a more substantial punishment becomes credible, so wider and \ndeeper cooperation can be achieved as a self-enforcing and renegotiation-proof equilib-\nrium.75 A similar mechanism is employed in the models in Carraro and Domenico \nSiniscalco and Botteon and Carraro.76 International environmental cooperation is linked \nto joint efforts into research and development. The idea is that in contrast to emission \nabatement which benefits potential free-riders as well, research and development can be \nconsidered a club good which benefits the participants of an agreement only. Hence po-\ntential free-riders have an incentive to join the agreement if the gains from joint research \nand development exceed the gains from free-riding on the other countries\u2019 emission \nabatement. \nThese arguments seem to suggest that issue linkage is a very promising means to \npromote international environmental cooperation. One must not disregard the many \nproblematic aspects of issue linkage, however. Indeed, the early contributions from re-\ngime theory, while praising issue linkage as a means to foster cooperation, have at the \nsame time stressed the problems of linkage. Robert D. Tollison and Thomas D. Wilett, \nfor example, emphasise the increase in transaction costs that can result from issue link-\nage.77 James K. Sebenius\u2019 influential and insightful discussion of issue linkage points \nout that issue linkage can make mutual cooperation less rather than more likely if divi-\nsive issues are linked and a joint settlement is required.78 \nAs concerns the employment of trade sanctions to bring about international environ-\nmental cooperation, all depends on one\u2019s implicit view on the benefits from trade. Many \n                                                 \n75\n Sanctions are cheaper than transfer payments as they do not impose any costs as long as the deter-\nrence of free-riding is successful. \n76\n Carraro and Siniscalco 1995, 1997; Botteon and Carraro 1998. \n77\n Tollison and Willett 1979. \n78\n Sebenius 1983. \n29 \nproponents of trade liberalisation would object to the suggestion, implicit in Barrett\u2019s \nanalysis, that trade sanctions do not harm the sanctioning party to a great extent. Indeed, \nthey would object to the very idea that trade liberalisation is a Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma \nwhere all gain from mutual liberalisation, but every player gains even more if only the \nother players open their markets for trade. Many liberal international economists would \ninstead maintain that it is always in a country\u2019s best interest to open its market no matter \nwhat other countries do.79 If this view on trade liberalisation is correct, however, then \ntrade sanctions are not necessarily a credible threat to deter free-riding and cannot pro-\nmote cooperation to a large extent. The challenge is to find specific trade areas for \nwhich sanctions hurt the free-riding countries substantially more than the cooperating \ncountries. Also, if trade sanctions are actually executed against free-riders then there is \nthe risk that these countries retaliate in imposing sanctions as well and that cooperation \nin other issue areas might collapse. \nAnother problem of international environmental agreements employing trade sanc-\ntions is that they can potentially clash with existing and quite powerful international \ntrading regimes such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The Montreal Protocol \non the banning of ozone-damaging substances is the major agreement so far that has \nincluded the threat of trade sanctions, both against the substances themselves as well as \nagainst goods produced with the help of these substances.80 Participation in the Protocol \nis by now almost universal and trade sanctions were never actually employed, which \nmight partly explain why no member to the WTO has ever challenged the trade clauses \nin the Protocol. There seems to be a consensus among scholars, however, that the Proto-\n                                                 \n79\n See, for example, Bhagwati and Hudec 1996. \n30 \ncol\u2019s trade incentives have been very important (see, for example, French 1994, p. 62; \nBrack 1996, p. 55; Barrett 1997b, p. 346; OECD 1999, p. 4). But major doubts remain \nwhether the Protocol is compatible with the obligations under the WTO regime.81 The \nsame holds potentially true for future agreements. How future international environ-\nmental agreements that employ trade sanctions to deter free-riding can be made com-\npatible with WTO and other trade regimes is a major topic for fruitful research.82 \nAs concerns linking international environmental cooperation to joint research and \ndevelopment efforts, problems arise if there are diminishing returns to these efforts, be-\ncause then it can be optimal to exclude some countries from the linked agreement even \nthough they should be participants to the agreement judged from the environmental per-\nspective alone. In some sense, this is the opposite problem to free-riding and it can dam-\nage rather than promote environmental cooperation under certain conditions.83 A more \nfundamental problem with this form of linkage is that it remains unclear why countries \nhave not long since realised the mutual gains from joint research and development ef-\nforts independent of the problem of international environmental cooperation. In other \nwords, why do countries wait until the free-riding problems in an international environ-\nmental agreement necessitate linkage in order to reap the excludable benefits from joint \nresearch and development? \nAll the mentioned problems of issue linkage notwithstanding, it could form a major \nobject for common research of regime theory and the economic theory of international \n                                                                                                                                               \n80\n Other agreements with major trade implications are CITES, the Convention on International Trade in \nEndangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flores, and the Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-\nboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. \n81\n See Brack 1996; OECD 1999. \n82\n See Neumayer (2000). \n83\n See Carraro and Siniscalco 1998, p. 567; Botteon and Carraro 1998, p. 185. \n31 \nenvironmental cooperation. The question is how the problems of linkage can be reduced \nand how linkage has to be employed such that it best promotes international environ-\nmental cooperation. In this respect, Stephan Kroll, Charles F. Mason and Jason F. \nShogren have provided an interesting finding that deserves further attention.84 In labora-\ntory experiments, they have studied the question whether issue linkage is likely to pro-\nmote cooperation more if the linkage is implicit (two games played simultaneously in a \nparallel institutional framework) or explicit (the linked game is played in a joint institu-\ntional framework). They have found that the participants in their experiments were \nmuch more likely to cooperate in the joint than in the parallel framework. It would be \ninteresting to explore whether this finding is robust and whether it is relevant outside the \nlaboratory as well. If so, then this finding would clearly call for explicitly linking issues \nin one single negotiation rather than holding parallel but separate negotiations at the \nsame time \u2014 under the condition that transaction costs are not substantially higher for \nexplicit issue linkage. \n \n \n5. Conclusion \nThis paper has tried to show that there is a lot to gain for both regime theory and the \neconomic theory of international environmental cooperation from learning from each \nother. Regime theorists have first coined the metaphor of \u2018cooperation under anarchy\u2019, \nbut regime theory can learn from the economic theory of international environmental \ncooperation about the adverse consequences on cooperation that follow from the re-\nquirements of self-enforceability and renegotiation-proofness of international environ-\nmental agreements as well as from emission leakage and \u2018perverse\u2019 strategic incentives. \n                                                 \n84\n Kroll, Mason and Shogren 1998. \n32 \nThe economic theory of international environmental cooperation, on the other hand, can \nbenefit from a better understanding of the myriad roles regimes play in promoting coop-\neration and can learn from the institutionally rich analysis of regime theory. \nLearning from the other school of thought is important, but it is merely a first step \nand it is somewhat one-sided. Examples were provided for which the two can fruitfully \nlearn from each other such as the consequences of unilateral action on international co-\noperation and why nation-states comply with international agreements and what this \nimplies for the problem of free-riding. The most interesting question, however, is one \nthat each school of thought has long since examined of its own: how can cooperation in \ninternational environmental affairs become wider and deeper? The focus should be on \ntwo things: first, on the role regimes play in developing social norms, conventions and \nconsiderations of fairness that limit free-riding and second, on the role of issue linkage, \nespecially with respect to trade sanctions. \nThe question is of course whether mutual learning is possible at all and whether it \nwould not diminish the relative strengths of both regime theory and the economic theory \nof international environmental cooperation. Would, for example, trying to include some \nof the insights from regime theory not diminish the elegance and explanatory power of \nthe models employed within the economic theory of international environmental coop-\neration? Admittedly, this is a possibility that cannot be dismissed offhand. It would be \nbeyond the scope of this paper to explore the limits of mutual learning opportunities \nhere. However, in principle I can see no reason why mutual learning would have to be \nimpossible or counter-productive. After all, as mentioned, some economists like Endres, \nFinus and Rundshagen have already successfully integrated insights from regime theory \nabout the prevalence of fairness considerations and uniform solutions into their model \nbuilding. Conversely, scholars of regime theory who have employed game theory in \nexamining what influence free-rider incentives, punishment costs and insider-outsider \n33 \ndynamics have on the emergence and effectiveness of regimes have certainly advanced \nregime theory. To make my point clear this paper has stressed and possibly at times \neven over-emphasised the differences between the economic theory of international en-\nvironmental cooperation and regime theory. To some extent at least, the two schools of \nthought are at times not quite as far apart in their methodological and conceptual \nframework as might have been suggested here. However, it remains true that even in \nthese cases explicit notice of the other school of thought is rarely taken. \nBecause of space restrictions, this paper could only sketch some of the major findings \nfrom both schools and outline the topics for which mutual learning opportunities are \ngreatest. All these topics have long since been examined by each school separately and \nin this respect this paper has not proposed any new topic for studying. What it has hope-\nfully achieved, however, is to convince readers that if scholars from both schools of \nthought took more notice of each other and aspired to learn from each other\u2019s findings, \nthen this would lead to a more comprehensive analysis and better understanding. With \nthese come better policy advice. If we can help policy makers to succeed in tackling \ninternational environmental problems, then we do our best. \n \n34 \nReferences \nAxelrod, Robert M. 1984.
