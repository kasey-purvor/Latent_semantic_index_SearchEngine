Second, even a quite weak periodic\nexcitation can lead to exponentially strong changes in the\nprobability distribution r(x ,t), thus offering the possibility\nof using periodic forces to control the system @8\u201311#.\nFor many years, analytic theory was restricted either to\nthe case of slow driving ~adiabatic regime! or to that of fast\nand weak driving ~regime of effective heating by the external\nforce @12#!. It was recently proposed that the interesting\nnonadiabatic regime, lying in between these two extremes,\ncan be treated in terms of a logarithmic susceptibility ~LS!.\nThis approximation is valid in both the underdamped @9# and\noverdamped @10# limits. However, up to now, most of the\ndiscussion has been restricted to the activation \u2018\u2018energy\u2019\u2019\nonly, and the range of applicability of the LS approach has\nnot been explored yet.\nIn this paper we investigate the validity of the LS approxi-\nmation over the whole of phase space. Analysis of the non-\nequilibrium potential in the limit of small noise intensities is\nperfomed using Monte Carlo simulations. The results are\ncompared with numerical integrations of the Fokker-Planck\nequation ~FPE!, the LS approximation, and the full Hamil-\ntonian theory of fluctuations. In doing so we show that for a\nmoderate amplitude of the driving force, there is a large re-\ngion of phase space within which the nonequilibrium poten-\ntial is almost flat. Within this region, a condition for appli-\ncability of the LS does not hold and applying it in the\nstandard way provides a very poor approximation. We pro-\npose a simple modification that extends the theory to cover\nwhole of the phase space.\nIn the limit of small noise intensity @1,9,10# the probabil-\nity distribution has a WKB @13# form\nr~x ,t !5z~x ,t !e2S[x ,t]\/D. ~1!\nIn the particular case of one-dimensional motion of a particle\ndriven by a periodically modulated field K(x ,t)52U8(x)\n1F(t) and a white Gaussian noise j(t),\nx\u02d9 5K~x ,t !1j~ t !, ^j~ t !&50, ^j~ t !j~0 !&52Dd~ t !,\n~2!\nthe action functional1063-651X\/2002\/66~2!\/021108~4!\/$20.00 66 0211S@x ,t#5\n1\n4E2\u2018\nt\n@x\u02d9 2K~x ,t !#2dt ~3!\nsatisfies a variational minimum principle.\nThe family of trajectories that minimize the action func-\ntional ~3! covers the coordinate space of the system ~2!. In\ngeneral, more than one trajectory arrives to any given point\nin the coordinate space @14,15#. Those providing the global\nminimum of S@x ,t# define the activation \u2018\u2018energy\u2019\u2019 to reach a\npoint x at a moment of time t, which plays the role of a\nnonequilibrium potential F(x ,t)5min S@x,t# @15#. These tra-\njectories are optimal paths along which the stochastic system\nfluctuates with overwhelming probability to a given remote\nstate, and they are experimentally observable @16,17#. Thus\nan analysis of the probability distribution of the nonadiabati-\ncally driven system in the limit of small noise intensity re-\nquires a solution of the variational problem ~3! with subse-\nquent global minimization of the action on the set of all\nextremal trajectories.\nUse of the LS @9,10# substantially simplifies such an\nanalysis. The theory calculates corrections to the activation\n\u2018\u2018energy\u2019\u2019 induced by the nonadiabatic driving. It does so in\nterms of the work done by the external field as the system\nmoves along the unperturbed trajectories in thermal equilib-\nrium, expressing the result in terms of a linear susceptibility.\nFor the archetypal example of the overdamped Duffing\noscillator ~2! the LS theory provides an analytical solution of\nthe long-standing nonadiabatic escape problem. More re-\ncently this theory was extended to find a complete solution\nof the nonadiabatic escape problem including corrections due\nto finite noise intensity. The validity of the theory was veri-\nfied experimentally for escape processes @4#. Encouraging\nagreement was obtained, which suggested that the LS might\nbe applicable throughout the whole coordinate space of the\nsystem ~2! in accordance with its original formulation @9#.\nWe now consider fluctuations that are large but not quite\nsufficient to cause escape from a potential well. In principle,\nthe LS should provide a simple way of estimating their prob-\nability distribution, even for nonadiabatic driving. For the\nsake of definiteness, we consider motion of a Brownian par-\nticle in a double-well Duffing potential U(x)52x2\/2\n1x4\/4 driven by a periodic force F(t)5A cos(2p\/T)t, and a\nzero-mean white Gaussian noise j(t). This model has been\nused for many physical systems ~see, e.g., Ref. @18#! includ-\u00a92002 The American Physical Society08-1\nBANDRIVSKYY, LUCHINSKY, AND MCCLINTOCK PHYSICAL REVIEW E 66, 021108 ~2002!ing those considered recently in the context of stochastic\nresonance @19#.\nThe nonequilibrium potential of this system is defined as\nF(x ,t)5limD\u219202D lnr(x,t). It can be measured experimen-\ntally in the limit of small noise intensity. The error in such\nmeasurements due to the necessarily finite noise intensity D\nis at least of the order of D, so the use of a small noise\nintensity in such experiments is important. That is why the\nmeasurements are usually complicated by the exponentially\nlong observation times needed to build the tails of the distri-\nbution. To overcome this problem we use a modified Monte\nCarlo numerical scheme, of which full details will be pre-\nsented elsewhere @20#. Here we mention only that the tech-\nnique has been tested on a number of different systems and\nthat good agrement was obtained with the results obtained\nusing traditional methods for larger noise intensities. The\nsimulation results are compared both with numerical integra-\ntions of the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to Eq. ~2!\nand with the predictions of Hamiltonian fluctuation theory, as\nwill be described below.\nAn example of 2D ln@r(x,t)# obtained by Monte Carlo\nsimulation is shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen from the figure\nFIG. 1. 2D ln@r(x,t)# given by the Monte Carlo simulations in\nthe low noise intensity limit ~for D50.002). The two bold lines are\ntime sections of F(x ,t) predicted by the formula ~4!.

It is in good agreement with results\nfrom Hamiltonian fluctuation theory and from the numerical\nsolution of the FPE.\nTo calculate ln@r(x,t)# using the LS theory we will follow\nthe original paper @10#. The basic assumption of the theory is\nthat a moderately strong driving field changes only slightly\nthe unperturbed fluctuational trajectory of the system ~2! in\nthermal equilibrium. If this assumption is valid, the F(x ,t)\nof the nonadiabatically driven overdamped Duffing oscillator\ncan be readily found by substitution into Eq. ~3! of the\nknown ~see, e.g., Ref. @20#! form of the fluctuational trajec-\ntory in thermal equilibrium given by x\u02d9 5U8(x).\nBy neglecting the term proportional to F2(t), F(x ,t) can\nbe found as a sum of the equilibrium potential DU(x)\n5U(x)2U(21) and a correction due to the driving force\n@9,10#\nF~x ,t !5DU~x !2E\n2\u2018\nt\nx\u02d9 o~ t8!F~ t8!dt8, ~4!\nwhere x\u02d9 o(t8) is the velocity of the particle fluctuating along\nthe optimal path in thermal equilibrium.

The results of\nthe calculations for two time cross sections are shown in\nFigs. 1 and 2. It can be seen from the figures that the LS\npredictions coincide with the results of the Monte Carlo\nsimulations everywhere except in the singular region where\nthere is a plateau close to the boundary of attraction men-\ntioned above. The deviation of the LS predictions from the\nresults of simulations in this region is systematic, much\nlarger than the noise intensity D, and clearly requires expla-\nnation.FIG. 2.

This line\nseparates regions of the coordinate space to which the system\narrives by different optimal fluctuation paths.\nThe region between the switching line and the boundary\nof attraction @xu(t)# is a singular plateau with almost con-\nstant action. Optimal fluctuation trajectories that arrive in\nthis region first move close to the MPEP and then bend and\nmove away from the boundary of attraction. In this region\nthe basic assumption of the LS theory\u2014that there are only\nsmall deviations of the fluctuational paths in the periodically\ndriven system from those in thermal equilibrium\u2014breaks\ndown. As shown in Fig. 3, an optimal equilibrium path\n~dash-dotted line! arrives to the singular plateau region in a\nvery different way compared to nonequilibrium optimal\npaths. As a consequence the predictions of the LS theory\ndeviate strongly from the measured nonequilibrium potential\nin this region.\nWhat can be done to improve the LS approximation in\nthis range? We note, first, that optimal paths reaching the\nsingular region move very close to the MPEP, thus acquiring\na value of action that is approximately the same as that ac-\nquired along the MPEP (Sesc50.2 for our choice of param-\neters!. Second, the action acquired along the optimal path\nanywhere in the region between xst(t) and xu(t) cannot be\nlarger then the escape \u2018\u2018energy\u2019\u2019 ~the activation \u2018\u2018energy\u2019\u2019!.\nThis must mean that the action inside the singular region is\nalmost equal to Sesc . We therefore propose that, to improve\nthe LS approximation in this region, we may cut the surface\ngiven by Eq. ~4! at the level of the escape action Sesc .\nIt can be seen from Figs. 2 and 4 that the predictions of\nthe LS theory, corrected in the singular region, almost coin-\ncide with the predictions of the Hamiltonian theory and the\nresults from numerical integration of the FPE over the whole\nbasin of attraction of the stable state, and that they are also in\nvery good agreement with the results of the Monte Carlo\nsimulations @23#.\nIn conclusion, one of the main results of the paper is the\nobservation that the probability distribution may have large,\nessentially flat regions in phase space. This is a purely dy-\nnamical effect that is not associated with the flatness of any\npotential. Its origin is related to switching between different\nFIG. 4.
