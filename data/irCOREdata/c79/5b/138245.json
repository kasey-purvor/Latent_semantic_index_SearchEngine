The methodology has been tested with an industrial sponsor producing high\nvacuum pumps for the semiconductor industry.\nKeywords: Design knowledge reuse, new product introduction, knowledge\nmanagement, product lifecycle management\n1 Introduction\nEngineering design in mature domains is increasingly competitive in today\u2019s\nglobalised manufacturing environment. One approach to assist in this competitive\ncycle is to reuse previous knowledge, and the main aim of this project is to provide an\nengineering knowledge management methodology to enable the creation of robust\ndesigns in less time, with lower production costs.\nAlthough the design process output, or solutions can be directly reused, they can not\nbe expected to function in the same way if they are directly scaled or if elements of\nthem are reused in different systems. Knowledge relating to geometry can otherwise\nbe reused through the formalisation of associations between product parameters. This\nenables optimisation of functionality where products are scaled up or down within\ncertain limits. Parametric associations that are embedded in CAD models help to\nspeed up product development, reducing the time required to reproduce well known\ncomponents. Many Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) tools provide the above\nBaxter, D. et al. (2007). An engineering design knowledge reuse methodology using process modelling.\nResearch in Engineering Design 18 (1) pp. 37-48\nfunctionality which provide solutions that interact with product data, particularly\ngeometry. However, there is a wealth of non-geometric knowledge elements that\ncould be reused but is missing from KBE systems. These include: project constraint\nreasoning, problem resolution methods, solution generation strategies, design intent,\nand supply chain knowledge.\nA significant body of research work has addressed the subject of what knowledge is,\nhow tacit and explicit knowledge differ and evolve (Nonaka 1994) (Saviotti 1998),\nthat tacit knowledge is best dealt with by social methods and not IT systems (Lubit\n2001) or that tacit knowledge can not be represented in an IT system (Johannessen et\nal., 2001) (Walsham 2001). The classic data, information and knowledge hierarchy\nhas been questioned (Tuomi 1999). Many papers with \u2018knowledge\u2019 in the title\n(particularly within engineering) do not attempt to address the issue of what\nknowledge is, they simply provide methods and tools for the business of managing it.\nIn the context of this paper, knowledge will be considered as \u2018actionable\ninformation\u2019. It is further assumed that knowledge can be stored in computer based\nsystems, and in a variety of forms: documents (text), images, diagrams, embedded\nalgorithms, formulae and rules. The important factor is that the \u2018knowledge object\u2019\ninfers knowledge to the user and that the object is in a format that enables appropriate\napplication. Since it has previously been applied and stored, this application is reuse,\nand thus, knowledge reuse.\n2 Review of Design Reuse\nA selection of existing reuse methods will be described, relating to methodology,\nCAD \/ CAE, function, meaning (ontology) and matching (case-based reasoning).\nReuse relating more specifically to the design process will be described in the\nfollowing section.\nSome approaches to design reuse base the system on a design methodology (Shahin et\nal., 1999) (Blessing 1995), structuring the elements of the system around the\nconceptual framework given by the design methodology (typically systematic design).\nGeneral design methodology can form a core element of a design reuse method, or\ncould itself be regarded as a design reuse method, in which fundamental principles are\nreused rather than specific design instances. Axiomatic design (Suh 1990) is an\napproach to systematise the design effort. Based on a formulation of the design\nrequirement (which is cited as the most important and difficult task in engineering)\nalternative solutions can be tested against the principles, or design axioms. The core\nassumption supporting the axiomatic approach is that there is a fundamental set of\nprinciples that determine good design practice.\nCAD \/ CAE based design reuse methods include component reuse, parametric design\n(both generative and variant: see Andrews et al., 1999), and KBE systems. Most\nComputer Aided Engineering (CAE) systems (such as Unigraphics, Catia, Pro-\nEngineer and ICAD) provide parameter-driven knowledge modelling capabilities\nwhich are normally based on a geometric model. These systems have design rules\nembedded in the parameters, and are used for very specific engineering calculations.\nThey are very well suited to solving complex, highly structured problems in which a\nlevel of optimisation is required.\nBaxter, D. et al. (2007). An engineering design knowledge reuse methodology using process modelling.\nResearch in Engineering Design 18 (1) pp. 37-48\nKnowledge Based Engineering (KBE) is generally regarded as an umbrella term\ndescribing the application of knowledge to automate or assist in the engineering task.\nKBE can be applied to a wide range of design tasks (Hew et al., 2001). Design\nknowledge, once embedded in KBE systems, is not accessible (for reuse) to non-\nprogrammers. This limits the potential to reuse the knowledge in other applications. In\norder to make this knowledge more generally reusable, the MOKA (Methodology and\ntools Oriented to Knowledge based engineering Applications) project provides a\nstandard methodology for developing KBE applications, enabling reuse of the\ncaptured knowledge through a modified-UML knowledge representation method\n(Sainter et al., 2000).\nDesign reuse approaches that apply function (Rodgers et al., 2001) (Rodgers et al.,\n1999) base the knowledge structure on a functional decomposition, which is a similar\napproach to QFD. In the CADET system, a flexible rule base is applied to describe the\ndomain knowledge \u2013 i.e. relating product attributes such as wheel size to requirement\nattributes such as \u2018easy to push\u2019. Another example is the Product Range Model\n(Costa and Young, R I M 2001) which is intended to support variant design activities\nthrough the representation of product functions, relevant design solutions and\n\u2018knowledge links\u2019 between these attributes.\nIn terms of shared understanding and knowledge representation, the development of\nontology and its application to engineering design is providing a means to represent\ndomain knowledge: understanding product (and manufacturing, service, etc.)\nconcepts, data elements, and relationships between concepts (Kerr et al., 2004).\nCase-Based Reasoning (CBR) has been applied in a variety of ways to enable design\nknowledge reuse. Essentially, it involves creating an index of the problem area, then\napplying artificial intelligence techniques to find similar cases. One relevant example\nis the conceptual design information server, in which the cases are selected by the user\nfrom a wide variety of information sources to support conceptual design (Wood III\nand Agogino 1996).\n2.1 Design reuse issues\nAround 20% of the designer\u2019s time is spent searching for and absorbing information.\nThis figure is even higher for technical specialists (Lowe et al., 2004a). Furthermore,\naround 40% of all design information requirements are met by personal stores, despite\nthe fact that more appropriate information may be available from other sources. The\ntype of information used changes during the design process (Lowe et al., 2004b).\nSome important factors to enable reuse include a method to first make design\nreusable, then to store the reusable elements so that they can be found. Even if\nknowledge stored in computer based systems is accessed, if it is to be reused, several\nadditional factors must be met: reusability, availability, and relevance. Efficient\nexploitation of past designs has been prohibited by the lack of a methodology to\nstructure past designs and information (Shahin et al., 1999). With a well structured\nlibrary of reusable past designs, and a method to make new design reusable, the issue\nof design reuse is greatly simplified.\nBusby provided a detailed study into problems with design reuse (Busby 1999). Most\nreuse problems were cases of reuse not taking place: belief that reuse was desirable\nBaxter, D. et al. (2007). An engineering design knowledge reuse methodology using process modelling.\nResearch in Engineering Design 18 (1) pp. 37-48\nbut not practised. The next most common problem was an unexpected amount of\nadditional effort to reuse. Others were knowledge loss through inappropriate\nreplication, and error where existing designs were reapplied to new purposes.\nA review of design reuse was carried out (Sivaloganathan and Shahin 1999). Several\nareas of future work are proposed, including: compatibility of knowledge models and\ndesign reuse models; integrating reuse tools with other systems; recording bad\ndesigns.\nDesign reuse remains a developing area, and many approaches have been developed.\nFurther effort is required to understand the needs of knowledge users and producers in\norder that appropriate methods can be applied (Markus 2001) (Busby 1999) (Finger\n1998).\n2.2 Process-based design reuse methods\nIt has been suggested that the design process is a driver of design reuse for decision\nmaking at all stages of product development (Inns and Neville 1998). Design reuse\ntools should support the project (or design process) as a means to reuse knowledge,\neither through guidance to reapply knowledge at the most effective time or through\nthe capture and application of the knowledge embedded in the process itself. If these\nfactors can be combined, the process can be used as a basis for design knowledge\nreuse (Baxter and Gao 2004) (Baxter and Gao 2005). The following table represents\nan attempt to categorise existing work in which the design process has a relationship\nto design knowledge management or design reuse.\n\uf0b7 Design process as KM core: the design process forms a central element of the\nknowledge management method, either through process templates, product\nmodel integration, or knowledge-based process support. (Blessing 1995),\n(Backer et al., 1995), (Park and Cutosky 1999), (Clarkson and Hamilton\n2000)\n\uf0b7 Integrating design rationale process: achieved either through annotation of a\nprocess model or by describing dependencies as part of the process. (BURGE\nand BROWN 2002), (Ramesh and Tiwana 1999)\n\uf0b7 Socio-technical system: describing the design process as a socio-technical\nsystem has implications for representation, management and computation. (Lu\net al., 2000), (Ramesh and Tiwana 1999), (Tucker and Hackney 2000)\n\uf0b7 Business process model: describing design in terms of task dependencies,\ninputs, outputs, constraints and so on. This type of research provides a means\nto represent and manage design through the application of a logical structure.\n(Shooter et al., 2000), (Hayashi and Herman 2002), (Tate and Nordlund\n1996), (Yassine and Falkenburg 1999), (Gorti et al., 1998), (Kalpic and\nBernus 2002), (Pakovich and Marjanovich 2001), (Huang and Gu 2006), (Park\nand Cutosky 1999), (Concheri and Milanese 2000), (Clarkson and Hamilton\n2000), (Sim and Duffy 2003), (Pavkovic and Marjanovic 2000)\n\uf0b7 Business process framework: as with the business process model category,\nthe process is described as a logical mechanism. The research categorised as\n\u2018framework\u2019 rather than \u2018process\u2019 describe the business model in a broader\nsense, as a collaborative exercise between business or product entities.\n(Salminen et al., 2000), (Blessing 1995), (Backer et al., 1995), (Huang and\nGu 2006), (Classen and Lopez 1998), (Paashuis and Boer 1997)\nBaxter, D. et al. (2007). An engineering design knowledge reuse methodology using process modelling.\nResearch in Engineering Design 18 (1) pp. 37-48\n\uf0b7 Decision support through designer monitoring: the designer interactions\nwith a workstation (direct interaction) or PLM system (database changes) are\nmonitored and responded to: active and dynamic design process support.\n(Leake and Wilson 2001), (Li et al., 2004), (Harding et al., 2003)\n\uf0b7 Design methodology as process description or management method: a\ngeneral design methodology forms a key element of the process representation\napproach, or is applied as a process management method \u2013 i.e. the design\nprocess describes how to follow the steps prescribed by the methodology.\n(Tate and Nordlund 1996), (Shahin et al., 1999), (Hicks et al., 2002),\n(Blessing 1995), (Salminen et al., 2000), (Backer et al., 1995), (Gardam and\nBurge 1997), (Pakovich and Marjanovich 2001), (Li et al., 2004), (Xu et al.,\n2002), (Paashuis and Boer 1997), (Clarkson and Hamilton 2000), (Hansen and\nAndreasen 2002), (Schofield and Gregory 2002), (Knott et al., 2003), (Li et\nal., 2004)\n\uf0b7 Design article representation: a relationship between the product and the\ndesign process: as a product of the process, a means to monitor the process, or\nas integration of knowledge types through mapping relationships between\nprocess and product. (Shahin et al., 1999), (Hansen and Andreasen 2002), (Li\net al., 2004), (Concheri and Milanese 2000), (Xu et al., 2002)\n\uf0b7 Design information capture and representation: a method embedded in the\ndesign process to promote and enable reuse across projects, products,\nprocesses or decisions. (Hicks et al., 2002), (Matsumoto et al., 2005),\n(Concheri and Milanese 2000), (Zdrahal et al., 2000), (Ramesh and Tiwana\n1999), (Knott et al., 2003), (Balasubramanian et al., 1999)\nThis analysis highlights some issues for further research: the relationship between the\ndesign process and the design object is not well understood. Integrating rationale with\nthe design process has relatively little work. Design process models as an integrated\npart of knowledge management also requires further analysis to identify the limits and\nnature of applicability determined by the type of design process. Another area for\nfurther research is an integrated knowledge reuse method for engineering design, in\nwhich a process model and product model are provided in a single framework.\nOne project which addresses some of these issues is the FIPER (Federated Intelligent\nProduct EnviRonment) project. This approach describes an environment within which\na variety of distributed services can be applied to an intelligent CAD master model.\nSoftware tools act as distributed service providers and service requestors (R\u00f6hl et al.,\n2000). Extensions to the project include a workflow model, developed to manage\nprocess definition, execution and resources (Wujek et al., 2000). The intelligent\nmaster model is most suitable for variant design in well known areas, where extensive\nproduct knowledge has been built up over many years and next generation will share\nmuch of the same geometrical relationships. It is also apparently a project with a focus\non detail design, since the central element of the approach, the master model, is a\nCAD based representation.\nOther notable process based methods include Signposting and the Design Roadmap.\nSignposting (Clarkson and Hamilton 2000) is a parameter driven task-based model\nof the design process. The task model does not have strong precedence links; instead\nthe method uses the level of confidence in key design and performance parameters as\nthe basis for identifying, or signposting, the next design task. The Signposting method\nBaxter, D. et al. (2007). An engineering design knowledge reuse methodology using process modelling.\nResearch in Engineering Design 18 (1) pp. 37-48\nis well suited to the development of new technologies in well understood application\nareas. The Design Roadmap (DR) method provides a novel formal method to\nrepresent the design process (Park and Cutosky 1999). The method enables the\nrepresentation of feedback and feedforward processes, which are common in design\nyet uncommon in other representations. The process data model enables a variety of\ngraphical representations, or views. Graph, matrix, tree and list views are supported.\nAdditional functions, including resource management, document attachment and\nnotification functions were added to the DR framework. The method mainly addresses\nproject management issues, which implicitly applies product knowledge.\n2.3 Next step of design reuse research\nExisting methods to reuse design knowledge are generally not compatible with the\nwhole product design process: some are suitable in conceptual design; most are\nfocused on detail design. Further research is needed to explore the potential of an\nintegrated process and product modelling approach. This should include non-\ngeometric knowledge such as problem solving methods, solution generation\nstrategies, design intent and project knowledge. These knowledge types are associated\nwith the variety of tasks in today\u2019s dynamic design process. The method proposed in\nthis project complements the existing approaches by enabling product data to be\nlinked to the non geometrical information through the process model. The CAD based\nmethods will remain highly valuable in supporting detailed design, while these other\nelements can support early stages of product development.\n3 Overview of the proposed approach\nThe underlying principle of the proposed approach is based on the interaction between\na design process model and a product data model through a set of parameters to meet\nthe particular needs of the application area: mature engineering design. In the early\nstage of new or developing designs, a great deal of details underlie (and can be\nextracted from) a description of a product that includes only a small number of\nparameters. These parameters may relate to size, performance, or other technical\ncharacteristics. Technical product types often include or refer to these parameters in\nthe product name (e.g. iH 600, an \u2018intelligent harsh 600m3h-1 pump). The\nparameterised model of the product is then extended to include parameters that are\ncalculated, or inferred, from the original specification. These parameters form a key\nelement in the creation of a product development process describing the best approach\nto the design of that product within the organisation concerned.\nAssuming that the organisation has developed similar products in the past, a large\namount of product knowledge can be applied to the creation of the design process.\nDuring enactment of the design process, the parameter based product model is\napplied. As the process model is carried out, the product model is populated.\nComputational methods are applied through the creation of relationships between the\nprocess task model and the parameterised product model. This architecture enables a\nvariety of analysis methods to use the same data set. The resulted product and process\nmodel together can be regarded as a project model or project template, and can be\nextended for specific product instantiations. The project model is created in such a\nway that the data sets are populated at the most appropriate time \u2013 and so any product\nanalysis is scheduled to take place when the data is available.\nBaxter, D. et al. (2007). An engineering design knowledge reuse methodology using process modelling.\nResearch in Engineering Design 18 (1) pp. 37-48\nFigure 1: System architecture\nThe proposed design knowledge reuse system therefore has two key elements (see\nFigure 1): a Process Model and a Product Model. The Process Model itself provides a\ndetailed structure that can be applied to the index and retrieval of additional\ninformation. The Product Model is a combination of product data and ontology. The\nproduct ontology in this case is a formal vocabulary defining the product objects. The\nproduct data can be directly manipulated within the system or externally. The product\nontology enables reasoning relating to product concepts, and retrieval of similar\nconcepts. The Process Logic Engine is the interface with the Process Model, which\nmanages the assignment and updating of tasks. The Process Logic Engine also\ninteracts with the Product Model, through the assignment of product data in the form\nof features. The Process Logic Engine serves as a trigger for the Library of Analysis\nMethods. These methods use the product data as input, carry out their function, and\nstore the result in the product model database. There is also a link between the Process\nModel and the Library of Analysis Method to allow dynamic management of the\nprocess itself.\nA major contribution of the method is derived from creating it. The method requires\nan investigation to capture the design process, followed by in-depth analysis to create\nthe project model (template). This exercise will allow the organisation to formalise\nand improve their methods in advance of applying the tool, which itself will provide\nbenefits.\nAs the limited scope of this project, the product model will be created to satisfy a\nminimum requirement, i.e., to allow the applicability and usefulness of the method to\nbe evaluated during design process execution. The emphasis is its flexibility and\nextensibility (not its completeness), i.e., when the product model is created, the\nproduct parameter exists as an open data field that can be set to a variety of standards\n(real, integer, string). With the process model established, links can be created that\npoint to additional data, enabling a focused retrieval method for information\nassociated with a given task or task set.\nProcess\nModel Data\n+\nKnowledge\nTask Data\n+\nKnowledge\nProduct\nModel Data\n+\nknowledge\nProcess Logic Engine\nBaxter, D. et al.

A detailed design process model has\nbeen developed, and the supporting knowledge has been captured and added to the\nmodel. The following section describes the approach in more detail, with a description\nof the example.\n4.1 The Selected component\nThe component selected for the knowledge capture exercise is the Head-plate, shown\nin Figure 2. The Head-plate serves several critical functions for the operation of the\nvacuum pump: seal, support, and lubrication. Internal, or shaft, seals prevent oil from\ncrossing from the bearing cavity to the process chamber. External seals prevent\ntransfer of atmospheric gas. Bearings support the shaft under load. They are lubricated\nwith a single charge of oil for the service life of the pump.\nThe Head-plate is designed as a common item for a range of pump types. View (a) is\nthe Head-plate stator side. The stator face is a key element of its functionality. Part of\nthe functionality. Critical elements include stator tolerances, shaft seal and\natmosphere seal. View (b) shows the bearing bores, critical elements include bearing\nbore geometrical and positional tolerances. The dynamic seal system, including gas\nflow channels for purge and pressure balancing, plays a major role in pump reliability.\nOne gas flow channel can be seen in view (c).\nView (a) View (b) View (c)\nFigure 2: Images of the Head-plate Showing Different Functional Features\n4.2 Process capture and representation\nThe design process for the Head-plate component was captured, and first represented\nusing Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF\u00d8) (Technology 1993).\nIDEF\u00d8 includes activity boxes, with arrows representing inputs, outputs, controls and\nmechanisms. A single activity represents the high level purpose. Each activity can be\nbroken down and shown in more detail in a child diagram.\nThe process capture was extended to show the source of the inputs to the design of the\nHead-plate. The IDEF\u00d8 representation requires several interrelated diagrams. The\nresulting process, at the top level of abstraction, included 8 tasks. The IDEF\u00d8\nformalism specifies 6 activities per page, which means that the diagram is not able to\nshow the whole process. It was also considered that this prevented the representation\nPump\nStator\nBearing\nbore\nBaxter, D. et al. (2007). An engineering design knowledge reuse methodology using process modelling.\nResearch in Engineering Design 18 (1) pp. 37-48\nof both context and detail in a single representation. The IDEF\u00d8 series enabled an\nobserver to gain an understanding of what is happening during the process. This\nwould be adequate if the system analysis task was required for that purpose (as it is in\na system design project). The requirement of the process representation method in this\nscenario is that it will enable the process to be reapplied, and knowledge about it to be\nreused. For this purpose the context is important, and so combination of the 6-node\nlimit along with the complex array of link types shown in an IDEF\u00d8 diagram\nprompted the search for an alternative. It should be emphasised that is not a lacking in\nthe process logic that prompted the selection of an alternative process modelling\nmethod. The change was driven by the need to understand, at a glance, an overview of\nthe process and its context. This requirement is in support of system usability.\nThe headplate design process was later modelled using the Design Roadmap (DR)\nFramework (Park and Cutosky 1999). The DR representation consists of two node\ntypes, task (the task itself to be enacted) and feature (which is a task data set). Link\ntypes include precedence, abstraction and constraints. Precedence shows order of task\nexecution, and likely iteration. Abstraction relates to the capability for a sequence of\nelements to be represented by a single element. Constraint links connect feature\nnodes, and show that a constraint exists. Note that the term \u2018feature\u2019 is the name given\nto the data objects included in the process model. It bears no relation to other uses of\nthe term \u2018feature\u2019 in the engineering domain.\nFigure 3 shows a view of Head-plate Design Tasks, modelled using DR Framework,\nwith some of the Features and their attribute slots visible. Iterations, feedback and\nside-effects have been removed for simplicity. Within the Head-plate design task,\nboth sequential and concurrent activities take place. Data that is required by later tasks\nis recorded in the features. For example, the Bearing Bore Feature contains data (size\nand tolerance) that will be used in the lubrication system design Task (see top of\nFigure 3). This same data set could also be used as an input to a manufacturability\nanalysis Task, i.e., data sets can be called by any Task object. The main objective of\nthe Features shown in this diagram is to provide data required by subsequent tasks. It\nis the Feature that triggers the Task. If a data set is required but not complete, the task\nwill not be initiated.\nTask\nDrive Layout\n(motor, gears,\nshaft)\nTask\nLubrication system\n(thrower, channels)\nlayout\nTask\nLip seal layout\nTask\nDynamic seal\ndesign\nTask\nBearing bore layout\nTask\nHeadplate Stator\nLayout\nFeature: Bearing Bore\nSize (diameter, depth)\nBore Tolerance\nGeometry Tolerance\nFeature: h\/p Stator\nSize (diameter, depth)\nBore Tolerance\nGeometry Tolerance\nFeature: Drive\nGear position\nMotor fixing\nShaft size\nFeature: Thrower\nSize:\ndiameter\ndepth\nTolerances\nFeature: Gas flow\nChannel location\nN2 Flow rate\nFeature: Lip Seal\nInternal diameter\nExternal diameter\nTolerances\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nBaxter, D. et al.

Within this application, the data that is represented in the Feature\nnodes is both created and used by the Tasks. For example, the Requirements\nSpecification Task produces a fully populated engineering requirements data set.\nOther Tasks use this Feature data as an input. It is possible to have a Task creating\nmultiple Features, and for a subsequent Task to use multiple input Features.\nThe data handling provided by the process model enables the Parameters of the\nproduct to be created through the enactment of the design process. An implicit method\nfor the handling of the data set is embedded in the design process, i.e., what the\nparameters are, where they are created, and where they are used. The explicit methods\napplied to the storage and manipulation of the data set are not made clear, so must be\ndefined.\nA full implementation of this method may involve several thousand Parameters.\nGrouping the parameters into Sets (Objects) could ease the retrieval and reuse process.\nRather than call an individual Parameter, an Object could be called. These Objects are\ncalled by the Features in the Process Model. Using an inheritance model, it will be\npossible to treat the Parameter Set as a hierarchy of Objects. The attributes of the\nobjects are populated through the product design process.\n4.4 Spreadsheet-based test system\nThis section describes how Microsoft Excel is used to implement the design\nknowledge reuse methodology. The Excel implementation applies a process model as\nthe central element. The process model is shown in figure 6. The prototype system\narchitecture is described in figure 4. This prototype system differs from the system\narchitecture described in figure 1. In the prototype system the process model itself is\nthe central element, with links to task data and product model data. The task model\nhas a user interface providing access to product model data.\nBaxter, D. et al. (2007). An engineering design knowledge reuse methodology using process modelling.\nResearch in Engineering Design 18 (1) pp. 37-48\nFigure 4. Prototype System Architecture\nThe process model contains links to the feature (data set) and task interface. In the\nExcel system, each feature and task object has its own worksheet. An example of the\nlinks between the worksheets is shown in figure 5: the \u2018engineering requirements\u2019\ndata set and the \u2018mathematical model\u2019 task are accessed is via the corresponding\nprocess object.\nFeature\nengineering\nrequirements\nTask\nmath. model\nFigure 5. Process object links\nThe \u2018feature\u2019 link opens a worksheet containing a read-only view of the relevant\nproduct parameters. Changes are made to the product master model via the task pages.\nEach task page, such as the mathematical model task in figure 8, includes \u2018output\u2019\ncells, which are the data input cells. Changes to these cells are reflected in the product\nmaster model, which is a separate worksheet.\nOnce a task is completed and the data is entered into the output cells, the user will\nclick the \u2018back\u2019 button (bottom-centre of figure 7), which links back to the process\nmodel, as shown in figure 6. From the process model the user has the option to click\non another task to complete or to click on a feature to view the data set contents.\nFuture implementations should provide a dynamic mechanism to guide the user to the\nnext task.

One such\nfeature, \u2018engineering requirements\u2019 is shown in Table 1. The Parameters in each\nfeature refer to data stored in the Master Product Model. In the Excel model this is\ncontained in a separate worksheet. This method enables a single parameter to be\naccessed by multiple features. The Product Data includes Feature name, Data, Data\nType and Units parameters. Only the name and data are displayed in the task pages.\nThe data type and units fields are for error checking and consistency: calculations on\nproduct parameters should not be allowed where the units are not compatible.\nWithin the Master Product Model there is scope for a Standard Parameter Set, relating\nto standard components such as standard dowels, along with the associated product\nfeatures \u2013 in this case tolerances for the associated press fit and clearance fit holes,\nalong with other product features. The Product Model also contains any necessary\nuniversal data, such as density of iron, to enable calculations \u2013 in this case the mass of\ncomponents.\n4.5 System Knowledge\nThree knowledge elements are included in the proposed knowledge reuse system: best\npractices knowledge (embedded in the process), task knowledge (supporting\ninformation and algorithms, or knowledge-based methods), and product knowledge (a\nproduct parameter template).\n4.5.1 Process knowledge\nThe product model and process model together enable effective distributed\ncollaboration on the product design. The process model itself represents knowledge\nrelating to the process (best practices knowledge). A deep knowledge of the product\nand experience of carrying out the design process in the context of the organisation\nare required to specify the \u2018best\u2019 design process model. The sequence of activities to\nproduce the required product function in the most effective way includes knowledge\nof relationships between product components, parameters, and materials. Process\ndecisions such as likely or necessary iterations and task dependencies all contribute to\nthe development of the process model. Additional project related (i.e. non-\nengineering) factors such as component lead time, product test times and\nBaxter, D. et al. (2007). An engineering design knowledge reuse methodology using process modelling.\nResearch in Engineering Design 18 (1) pp. 37-48\norganisational factors such as the availability of expertise and systems also contribute\nto the process model. As such, the process model represents one of the knowledge\nelements embedded within the proposed method.\n4.5.2 Task knowledge\nThe second knowledge element is task knowledge. This includes information and\nautomation. Supporting information is available to support the designer in completing\nthe task. It includes general notes, formal design documentation, images, tables, and\ncatalogues. Informal notes and annotation, or rationale, may be added during the\nprocess. The combination of these elements is intended to be brought together and\nedited for reuse in the next generation product template to support design decisions.\nAutomation, in this context, is the application of knowledge based methods or\nalgorithms to manipulate the product data. These algorithms take parameters from the\nproduct model as inputs, make calculations on them, and store them as new or\nupdated parameters.\n4.5.3 Product knowledge\nThe third knowledge element is referred to as product knowledge. In this\nimplementation of the system, the product knowledge is represented by the parameter\nset. This enables the application of a product template to the development of a new\nproduct variant. The template can be applied at a variety of levels. The first is \u2018data\nlabels only\u2019, to develop a whole new product of the same type (such as the next\ngeneration product in the range). The second level can be applied on a broad spectrum\ndepending on the constraints: using a partial data model to develop a new product\nfamily member (such as a different pumping speed or application variant). Clearly the\napplication of the partial data model exists within certain limits, which must be\ndefined for each product type.\nOne aim is to extend the product knowledge element to include a product ontology to\nrepresent a collectively defined lexicon of terms, agreed parameter ranges and\nrelationships between terms. This should improve the understanding of the design\nprocess, and also extend the capability for managing the design process in a\ndistributed manner.\n4.5.4 Relationship with KBE\nThis system is not itself a KBE system; however it does have the capability to include\nKBE methods. The main contribution in terms of KBE is a system to provide the\ncapability to define multiple input and output data sets for analysis by multiple KBE\nsystems. The definition of the product model will be shaped by the organisational\nrequirements at the early design stages. Product model parameters and structure\n(content of individual data sets) will be defined according to the needs of the process,\nincluding KBE systems. The process model supports KBE by including the required\ntasks. Task knowledge includes KBE methods, or in the case of external systems,\nsupport for carrying out the task. Automation of the task, including data input \/ output,\nrepresents system task knowledge.\n4.6 Application and extension of the DR method\nThe process representation method is based on the DR (Design Roadmap) method. It\nshould be noted that the implementation applies only a part of the DR framework. The\nBaxter, D. et al. (2007). An engineering design knowledge reuse methodology using process modelling.\nResearch in Engineering Design 18 (1) pp. 37-48\nbasic process logic was applied: a data object precedes (and is consumed by) a task\nobject. Precedence and abstraction links were the only types applied to the example.\nThe other DR link types (feedback, feedforward and constraint relationships) would\nadd value to an extended process model. The DR process logic was also not\nrigorously defined in this test system; the main objective being the process\nrepresentation. It is therefore not possible to show alternate views of the process\n(design structure matrix representation is an option in the DR system).\nOne limitation of the DR method is that there is no method to link task knowledge,\nincluding supporting information and computational methods, to the process model.\nThe approach described in this paper provides a method to link task knowledge to the\nprocess model. Supporting information is stored and indexed with relation to tasks.\nThrough interaction with a product model, computational methods can also be applied\nto task support. The product model concept further extends the DR method, by\nsuggesting that product and process data are stored separately.\n5 Evaluation of the proposed methodology and its\npotential applications\nWithin variant design domains, where similar products are designed for several\ngenerations, this approach can provide significant benefit. The application of process\ntemplates along with the capability to store and apply additional information and data\nwill significantly enhance the reuse of product knowledge, and so improve the product\ndevelopment effort. If the product in question is highly complex, and also highly\nsimilar to the last generation, the organisation will gain most benefit from the\napplication of KBE technologies that aid the synthesis and analysis of the next\ngeneration product. The method proposed here, in that case, could be applied to the\nmanagement of design and project knowledge, especially unstructured knowledge that\nsupports product development. The calculations (KBE driven analysis) will be carried\nout using the proprietary KBE systems. So this method will be of use to the product\ndevelopment team, but more benefits will be gained from the application of KBE\nsystems. The management of structured knowledge provided by this approach will\nallow the product development team to keep a central data store that tracks the\nproduct development, enabling better coordination of distributed teams. The process\nmanagement methods and the methods to store and retrieve unstructured information\nwill also serve a useful purpose. The significance of KBE and geometry based\nmethods is due to the high relative importance of geometry in later stages of the\ndesign process 8, and the scale of the detailed design effort when compared to\nconceptual design, particularly with highly complex products.\nThe (project) model context relates directly to the product. A process map template is\ncreated for a specific product type, just as the product model template. If the type of\nproduct differs widely from one generation to the next, then the amount of detail\nrelevant to the next product will be greatly reduced. There comes a point at which the\nbenefits to be gained from applying such a context specific knowledge reuse tool are\novertaken by the costs, when compared with following a general design process. In\nsuch cases, the method can be used to implement a general design (or innovation)\nmethodology. It can also be used to store and manage design data through the process.\nThis relationship is described in the matrix in figure 8.\nBaxter, D. et al. (2007).

Where vacuum pump is shown on the\nmatrix to have moderate complexity, this is in comparison to an aero engine.\n6 Conclusion\nThe method described in this paper addresses the need to reuse engineering design\nknowledge. Three knowledge types are supported: process knowledge, product\nknowledge, and task knowledge. The underlying principle of the methodology is the\ninteraction between a product model and a process model through a set of parameters\nto meet the particular needs of an application domain. The proposed system provides\nproject guidance and monitoring, a framework to organise information and knowledge\nretrieval, and a central repository of product data. These elements can be brought\ntogether through the use of a combined method to represent the design process,\nprovide data support, and to form relationships between the process model and\nproduct concepts. The system has been tested with an industrial sponsor on a major\ncomponent. The next challenge is to build additional product components into the\nmodel, with the longer term aim being to capture and represent knowledge for an\nentire product family.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the funding provided for this collaborative\nproject through the Cranfield University and Loughborough University Innovative\nManufacturing Research Centres, which are supported by the Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council.
