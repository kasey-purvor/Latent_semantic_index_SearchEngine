We analytically and numerically discuss the plasma distribution and\nelectron temperature enhancement in striations for a given heating source. It is\nshown that, in stationary conditions, the reduced plasma concentration and the\ntemperature enhancement should be of the same order of magnitude. We deduce\nthat the electron temperature inside striations cannot greatly exceed that in the\nheated volume. The elongation of striations is calculated for different transverse\nscales and heating powers. We show that medium sized irregularities are associated\nwith striations and develop after the formation of striations. The peculiarities of\nthe relaxation process for small-scale and medium sized artificial irregularities are\ninvestigated and it is found that the relaxation of small-scale irregularities exhibits\ntwo time scales, in qualitative agreement with experimental observations.\n1. Introduction\nSmall-scale artificial field-aligned irregularities (AFAI) also known as \u2018striations\u2019\nappear in the F-region of the ionosphere illuminated by a powerful high-frequency\n(HF) radio wave. According to theory, striations are formed due to the conver-\nsion of the electromagnetic (EM) pump wave into upper-hybrid resonance (UHR)\noscillations on small-scale plasma inhomogeneities (Gurevich 1978). The variation\nof the reduced plasma concentration in striations measured directly on a rocket\nis of the order of a few per cent (Kelley et al. 1995). Typical transverse scales\nof striations obtained in the same experiment are about L\u22a5 \u223c 3\u201310m, although\nthe total spectrum of excited artificial plasma inhomogeneities is very broad and\ncomplicated. Its behaviour for scales from metres down to several centimetres was\ninvestigated long ago by backscattering (Minkoff et al. 1974). However, artificial\nirregularities with larger transversal scales are also excited in heating experiments.\nIn addition to a pronounced maximum for scales \u223c5m, a local spectral maximum\nalso exists at scales of the order of a few hundreds of metres (Erukhimov et al.\n1987). As for the elongation of AFAI, only rather scant information is available.\nDifferent authors give various estimates for the elongation of striations: L\u2016 \u223c 3\u2013\n5 km (Rao and Thome 1974; Korovin et al. 1983), L\u2016 \u223c 10\u201315 km (Jones et al. 1984;\n316 N. Borisov, A. Senior and F. Honary\nKelley et al. 1995). In the existing theory, only crude estimates are obtained based\non ambipolar ion diffusion and recombination lifetime (Gurevich et al. 1995a).\nFor medium-sized irregularities (L\u22a5 \u223c 50\u2013200m), it was found by experiments\nthat they can extend below the reflection height by about 100 km, thus covering\nthe whole F-region (Hedberg et al. 1983; Bakhmet\u2019eva et al. 1989). It is interesting\nto mention that according to Bakhmet\u2019eva et al. (1989), such irregularities first\nappear at the heights where striations are formed and later on begin to occupy a\nlarger height interval.\nThe modern theory of the stationary state of striations predicts a large (3\u20134\ntimes) increase of the temperature of electrons inside striations and at the same time\na very weak variation of plasma concentration (Gurevich et al. 1995a,b). Significant\ntemperature enhancement is indeedmeasured by incoherent scattering during heat-\ning (Robinson et al. 1996; Leyser et al. 2000). Unfortunately, in such experiments\nit is impossible to distinguish whether the rise of temperature occurs only inside\nstriations or in the bulk plasma. At the same time, Peria et al. (1999) reported rocket\nobservations of the electron temperature enhancement inside striations to be of the\norder of 100K. The absolute temperature was not measured in this experiment,\nbut it seems reasonable to assume that this equates to an enhancement of 10% or\nless.\nIn the present paper we give a detailed analytical analysis of the stationary\ndistributions of plasma density and electron temperature in a single striation. The\nanalytic results are supported by a two-dimensional (2D) numerical analysis which\nwe also use to investigate, in a basic form, the effects of vertical inhomogeneity in\nthe ionosphere. We show that, as the temperature and density perturbations are\nof the same order due to the balance of pressure, the small density perturbations\nobserved in striations imply that the electron temperature inside striations cannot\ngreatly exceed the background temperature in the heated volume. We demonstrate\nthat the elongation of striations can be expected to be greater than previously\nthought. We also discuss the formation of medium-sized irregularities and show\nthat they are closely connected to striations. Based on our results, the relaxation\nof AFAI with different transverse scales is investigated.\n2. Basic equations\nIn this section we derive equations describing the stationary conditions of AFAI\nin the F-region of the high-latitude ionosphere. Let us assume that the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field is directed along the vertical z-axis and in the transversal plane\nthe inhomogeneity exists only along the x-axis. The results obtained in this paper\nare valid also in the case where striations have axial symmetry, that is, they\nare considered as cylinders stretched along the z-axis. We suppose that at the\nheights where striations are formed, collisions with ions play the main role for\nelectrons, \u03bdei\u0001 \u03bden, where \u03bdei, \u03bden are the electron collision frequencies with ions and\nneutrals. However electrons in the ionosphere lose their energy mainly in nonelastic\ncollisions with neutrals (Gurevich, 1978). The corresponding losses determined by\nthe frequency \u03b4en\u03bden are much larger than the losses in collisions with ions \u03b4ei\u03bdei\nup to heights of approximately 300 km. For larger heights, the losses in collisions\nwith ions give a significant contribution to the total losses if the increase of the\nbulk electron temperature in the heated volume is small enough. Here \u03b4en is a loss\nrate in non-elastic collisions with neutrals, \u03b4ei \u2248 2m\/M is a loss rate in collisions\nStationary state and relaxation of artificial irregularities 317\nwith ions and m,M are the masses of the electron and ion. For ions, collisions with\nneutrals \u03bdin play the main role even in the F-region of the ionosphere due to the\nsmall ratio m\/M : M\u03bdin\u0001m\u03bdei.\nTo discuss the stationary distribution of plasma and the heating in striations,\nfor electrons we use the hydrodynamic equations in a completely ionized plasma\nderived by Braginskii (1965) with slight modifications. In the heat equation we\ninsert an additional term \u03b4en\u03bden describing the energy losses in non-elastic collisions\nand in the continuity equation the finite lifetime of electrons \u03c4r is retained. As for\nions we distinguish two different cases. It is well-known that hydrodynamics can\nbe used only if the transversal scale of plasma inhomogeneity L\u22a5 is much larger\nthan the Larmor radius L\u22a5\u0001 \u03c1Hi = vTi\/\u03c9Hi, where vTi is the thermal speed, \u03c9Hi is\nthe cyclotron frequency of ions. In the ionosphere \u03c1Hi \u2248 3\u20135m, which is of the order\nof a transversal scale of striations. It means that we have to discuss two cases. If\nL\u22a5\u0001 \u03c1Hi ions can be described within hydrodynamics; otherwise a kinetic approach\nshould be used.\nElectrons in a completely ionized plasma in stationary conditions are described\nby the following set of equations:\n\u2022 the continuity equation\n\u2202Nvex\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202Nvez\n\u2202z\n+\nN \u2212 N0\n\u03c4r\n= 0; (2.1)\n\u2022 the equation of motion\n\u2212\u2207pe + eN\n(\n\u2207\u03d5 \u2212 ve\nc\n\u00d7H\n)\n\u2212mN\u03bdei(0.51u\u2016 + u\u22a5) \u2212 0.71N\u2207\u2016Te \u2212 32\n\u03bdeiN\n\u03c9He\nh\u00d7 \u2207Te = 0 (2.2)\nand;\n\u2022 the heat equation\n3\n2\nve\u2207Te + Te\u2207ve + 1\nN\n\u2207qe + 32\u03b4en\u03bden(Te \u2212 Te0) = QT.

This time is much larger than the period required for the formation of\nthe stationary state of striations (Frolov et al. 1997). Hence we may set \u03c4r \u2192 \u221e.\nFor typical scales of striationsL(N)\u2016 \u0001 106 cm,L\n(N)\n\u22a5 \u223c (5\u201310) \u00d7 102 cm and the values\nof the frequencies \u03bdin \u223c 2\u20135 s\u22121, \u03c9Hi \u223c 102 s\u22121, we find that the longitudinal terms\nin (2.8) are much smaller than the transversal terms. As a result, an approximate\nrelation between plasma perturbation and electric potential applies:\n\u2202N\n\u2202x\n+\neN\nTi\n\u2202\u03d5\n\u2202x\n= 0. (2.9)\nIn the case of small-scale plasma inhomogeneities L\u22a5\u0002 \u03c1Hi, it follows from a kinetic\napproach that ions have, in the first approximation with respect to L\u22a5\/\u03c1Hi, a\nBoltzmann distribution (Kadomtsev and Pogutse 1970)\nN = N0 exp\n(\n\u2212e\u03d5\nTi\n)\n. (2.10)\nHence, in both cases the same relation (2.10) between plasma perturbation and\nelectric potential applies.\nNow we concentrate on the equations for electrons. Using (2.10) we eliminate\nthe electric potential \u03d5 from the system (2.1)\u2013(2.3). It is convenient to introduce\ndimensionless functions\nN\nN0\n= n(z, x),\nTe\nTe0\n= \u03c4(z, x).\nNote that this temperature Te0 can significantly exceed the undisturbed (without\nheating) temperature of electrons in the ionosphere. In deriving hydrodynamic\nequations we take into account that collision frequencies \u03bdei, \u03bden depend on the\nelectron temperature\n\u03bdei = \u03bd\n(0)\nei \u03c4\n\u22123\/2, \u03bden = \u03bd(0)en \u03c41\/2, (2.11)\nStationary state and relaxation of artificial irregularities 319\nwhere \u03bd(0)ei , \u03bd\n(0)\nen are the background collision frequencies in the heated volume\n(Schunk and Nagy 1978). If the pump frequency is not very far from the crit-\nical frequency of the ionosphere, the height variation of the background plasma\nconcentration N0(z) can be neglected. In this case the strongest dependence on\nthe z-coordinate exists in the diffusion coefficient D(e)\u2016 (z). Here D\n(e)\n\u2016 =Te\/m\u03bdei\nand D(e)\u22a5 =Te\u03bdei\/m\u03c92He are the longitudinal and transverse diffusion coefficients\nfor electrons. Such a dependence can be modelled in numerical calculations by\na linear function D(e)\u2016 (z) = D\n(e)(0)\n\u2016 (1 + z\/Lz). The height dependence of other\nparameters (D(e)\u22a5 , Te0, N0) is weaker and is therefore neglected.

(2.15)\n320 N. Borisov, A. Senior and F. Honary\n3. Analytical analysis of plasma distribution and temperature\nenhancement\nLet us assume that the background plasma is vertically homogeneous and perturb-\nations are weak enough |\u2206n|\u0002 1, |\u2206\u03c4 |\u0002 1. In this case the problem can be discussed\nanalytically. Taking into account that each striation is localized in space, that is\n\u2206n \u2192 0,\u2206\u03c4 \u2192 0 for |z| \u2192 \u221e or |x| \u2192 \u221e, after the integration of (2.14), (2.15)\nalong the magnetic field line, we arrive at the following set of ordinary differential\nequations (\n1 +\nTi\nTe0\n)\nD\n(e)\n\u22a5\nd2\ndx2\n\u222b\n\u2206ndz + 2.5D(e)\u22a5\nd2\ndx2\n\u222b\n\u2206\u03c4 dz = 0 (3.1)\n(\n1 +\nTi\nTe0\n)\nD\n(e)\n\u22a5\nd2\ndx2\n\u222b\n\u2206ndz + 4.1D(e)\u22a5\nd2\ndx2\n\u222b\n\u2206\u03c4 dz \u2212 \u03b4en\u03bden\n\u222b\n\u2206\u03c4 dz =\n2\n3\n\u222b\nQT dz\nTe0\n.\n(3.2)\nThe relation between height-integrated perturbation of plasma in striations and\nthe temperature of electrons follows from (3.1):\u222b\n\u2206ndz = \u2212 2.5\n1 + Ti\/Te0\n\u222b\n\u2206\u03c4 dz. (3.3)\nIt is convenient to introduce the vertical scale of the enhanced temperatureL(T )\u2016 and\nthe length of striations L(N)\u2016 . According to (3.3) the reduced plasma concentration\ncan be estimated as\n\u2206n \u223c \u2212 2.5\n1 + Ti\/Te0\nL\n(T )\n\u2016\nL\n(N)\n\u2016\n\u2206\u03c4.\nThe values L(T )\u2016 and L\n(N)\n\u2016 should be of the same order. Indeed, in stationary\nconditions perturbations of temperature at any point cause variations in plasma\nconcentration due to the balance of pressure. Hence, the variation of the reduced\nplasma concentration in striations is of the same order of magnitude as the variation\nof the reduced electron temperature. This means that, at least in the linear approx-\nimation, the increase of the reduced temperature \u2206\u03c4 causes a similar decrease of\nthe reduced plasma concentration. The system of equations (3.1) and (3.2) reduces\nto one equation:\n1.6D(e)\u22a5\nd2\ndx2\n\u222b\n\u2206\u03c4 dz \u2212 \u03b4en\u03bden\n\u222b\n\u2206\u03c4 dz = \u22120.7\n\u222b\nQT dz\nTe0 + Ti\n.

(3.5)\nIf the transverse scale of the heating source in the right-hand side of (3.4) is less\nthan L\u2217\u22a5, the plasma inhomogeneity in stationary conditions still has a scale of the\norder of \u223c L\u2217\u22a5. In the opposite case, the transverse scale of the inhomogeneity is\ndetermined by the source\u222b\n\u2206ndz \u2248 \u22122.5\n\u222b\nQT dz\n(1 + Ti\/Te0)\u03b4en\u03bden\n. (3.6)\nStationary state and relaxation of artificial irregularities 321\nIntegrating (2.14), (2.15) across the magnetic field line, we find an equation for the\nlongitudinal distribution of inhomogeneity\nD\n(e)\n\u2016\nd2\ndz2\n\u222b\n\u2206\u03c4 dx \u2212 0.3\u03b4en\u03bden\n\u222b\n\u2206\u03c4 dx = \u22120.3\n\u222b\nQT dx\nTe0\n. (3.7)\nThis equation contains another characteristic scale that is connected to the length\nof striations\nL\u2217\u2016 =\n(\nD\n(e)\n\u2016\n\u03b4en\u03bden\n)1\/2\n. (3.8)\nApplying a Fourier transform across the magnetic field line of the form\n\u2206n\u03ba(z) =\n1\n2\u03c0L\u2217\u22a5\n\u222b\n\u2206n(x, z) exp i\n(\n\u03bax\nx\nL\n(\u2217)\n\u22a5\n)\ndx,\nwe arrive at the following equation for the Fourier components of plasma perturb-\nation [\nL\n(\u2217)4\n\u2016\nd4\ndz4\n\u2212\n(\n1.6L(\u2217)2\u2016\nd2\ndz2\n+ 0.4\n)\n+ 0.4\u03ba4x + 0.2\u03ba\n2\nx\n]\n\u2206n\u03ba\n=\n(\n0.4\u03ba2x \u2212 0.6L(\u2217)2\u2016\nd2\ndz2\n)\nQ\u03ba\n(\u03b4en\u03bden)2(Te0 + Ti)\n. (3.9)\nHere \u03bax = kxL\u2217\u22a5 is the dimensionless wave number along the x-axis. If the heating\nsource has a large transverse scale (\u03ba2x\u0002 1) it follows from (3.9) that the length of\na striation is determined by(\n\u2212L(\u2217)2\u2016\nd2\ndz2\n+ 0.4\n)\n\u2206n\u03ba = 0.6\nQ\u03ba\n(\u03b4en\u03bden)2(Te0 + Ti)\n. (3.10)\nIt is seen from (3.10) that the maximal length of a striation in the vertically\nhomogeneous ionosphere is approximately equal to 3L\u2217\u2016. It is achieved for striations\nwith not too small transverse scalesL(N)\u22a5 > L\n(\u2217)\n\u22a5 . With the decrease of the transverse\nscale the length of a striation changes. It is seen that the solution of (3.9) decreasing\nfor |z| \u2192 \u221e takes the form\n\u2206n\u03ba(z)=C1(\u03bax) exp\n(\n\u2212 p1 |z|\nL\n(\u2217)\n\u2016\n)\n+ C2(\u03bax) exp\n(\n\u2212 p2 |z|\nL\n(\u2217)\n\u2016\n)\n, (3.11)\nwhere p1,2 are the following\np21,2 = 0.8\u03ba\n2\nx + 0.2 \u00b1\n\u221a\n0.24\u03ba4x + 0.16\u03ba2x + 0.04, (3.12)\nand C1(\u03bax), C2(\u03bax) are determined by the source in the right-hand side of (3.9).\nIt is interesting to mention that the solution (3.11) determines striations with\ntwo different lengths (due to the fact that p1 > p2). The first solution (with the\ncoefficient p1 in the exponent) describes a striation that is definitely shorter than\na striation with large transverse scale (determined by (3.10)). The second solution\ncorresponds to a striation with a length that is close enough to the length of a broad\nstriation. This means that in the general case the length of striations increases with\nthe growth of the transversal scale. This result is in qualitative agreement with the\nexperimental data (Frolov et al. 1997).\n322 N. Borisov, A. Senior and F. Honary\nIt is possible to find an analytical solution of the nonlinear system (2.12), (2.13)\nin some approximation. We suppose once more that the background plasma is ver-\ntically homogeneous and only perturbations with large transverse scales L(N)\u22a5 \u0001L\u2217\u22a5\nare to be considered. In this case a relation between the reduced plasma perturba-\ntion n and the electron temperature \u03c4 follows from (2.12)\nn =\n(1 + Ti\/Te0)\u03b1\n(\u03c4 + Ti\/Te0)\u03b1\n, \u03b1 = 1.71. (3.13)\nUsually in the F-region of the ionosphere the temperature of ions is smaller than\nthe temperature of electrons and so the ratio Ti\/Te0\u0002 1 is neglected. After the\nsubstitution of (3.13) into the heat equation (2.13), we arrive at the following\nequation\nd2f\nd\u03b62\n\u2212 0.9(f\u22121\/9 \u2212 f\u22122\/3)= \u22120.6\n\u222b\nQT(x) dz\n\u03b4en\u03bdenTe0\n\u03b4(z), (3.14)\nwhere f = \u03c41.8, \u03b6 = z\/L\u2217\u2016. As the length of the temperature perturbation is much\nlarger than the range of heights where the heating source is localized, we are able to\npresent the source in the right-hand side of (3.14) as a \u03b4-function. The homogeneous\nequation (3.14) reduces to a differential equation of the first order\ndf\nd\u03b6\n= \u2213\n\u221a\n2(f8\/9 \u2212 1) \u2212 5.4(f1\/3 \u2212 1), (3.15)\nwhere the signs \u2213 correspond to \u03b6 > 0 and \u03b6 < 0. From (3.14) and (3.15) we arrive\nat the following equation for the maximal reduced temperature \u03c40(x) reached in a\ncross section of a striation at \u03b6 = 0\n\u03c41.60 \u2212 2.7\u03c40.60 + 1.7 = 0.05(\n\u222b\nQT(z, x) dz)2\n(\u03b4en\u03bdenL\u2217\u2016Te0)2\n. (3.16)\nIt is seen from (3.16) that with the growth of the heating source power QT the\ntemperature of electrons also increases. For high powers the maximal reduced\ntemperature rises as\n\u03c40 \u221d\n(\u222b\nQT dz\n)5\/4\n. (3.17)\nThe distribution of the enhanced electron temperature along a striation is obtained\nnumerically from (3.15). The results of computations are presented in Fig. 1 for\ndifferent values \u03c401 = 3, \u03c402 = 1.1. It is seen that the length of the perturba-\ntion is very large L(N)\u2016 \u0001 100km. It can be even more for a high maximal tem-\nperature enhancement \u03c40\u0001 1. This conclusion is based on the assumption that\nthe usual collision frequency \u03bdei for electrons can be used. As the plasma inside\nstriations is in a turbulent state due to the excitation of UHR oscillations, it\nis quite obvious that effective collision frequency \u03bd(eff)e should be introduced in\nour calculations instead of \u03bdei. It is well known that the effective collision fre-\nquency substantially exceeds the usual collision frequency for high levels of tur-\nbulence. Therefore, the length of a striation should be smaller than that obtained\nin Fig. 1.\nIt is important to mention that the distribution of plasma determined by (3.13)\nshows that strong enhancement of the electron temperature causes the formation of\na very deep plasma cavity.

Nevertheless, the increase of the background temperature\nTe0 compared to the non-disturbed electron temperature in the ionosphere can be\nsignificant.\n4. Numerical analysis of the distribution of plasma and electron\ntemperature in striations\nNumerical analysis allows us to consider the full 2D solution of the nonlinear\nequations (2.12), (2.13). The purpose of this analysis is to validate the analy-\ntical approximations of the previous section and investigate the effect of vertical\ninhomogeneity of the ionosphere on the solutions in a basic form. We note that\ncomputational modelling would, in principle, allow a fully self-consistent model of\nthe development of striations to be constructed. However, many processes must\nbe taken into account, in particular, the plasma turbulence in the region where\nthe EM pump wave couples to the upper-hybrid waves. A comprehensive model\nwould have to simultaneously address small-scale features such as this, and the\npropagation of the pumpwave and the plasma transport processes on the large scale.\nBefore such a model can be constructed it is important to understand at a basic\nlevel the processes involved. Here we confine ourselves to discussing in detail the\nnature of the transport processes associated with striations for a specified heating\nsource.\n324 N. Borisov, A. Senior and F. Honary\nNumerical modelling of plasma and electron temperature distribution in the\nionosphere heated by powerful radio waves has been undertaken many times, e.g.\nHansen et al. (1990), Blaunstein (1996, 1997), Guzdar et al. (1998), Gondarenko\net al. (1999). These papers either considered large-scale modification in which trans-\nverse transport can be neglected or only included it approximately. In our case,\ntransverse transport is very important because of the small scale sizes of stri-\nations across the magnetic field and our model fully includes transverse transport\neffects.\nEquations (2.12) and (2.13) were solved numerically for n and \u03c4 using a finite-\ndifference method on a non-uniform rectangular (x, z) grid. Since (2.13) is nonlinear\nin \u03c4 , an iterative method was used in which a linearized version of (2.13) was\nsolved at each step such that the solution converged to the solution of the nonlinear\nequation (2.13). The heating source QT is modelled by a two-dimensional Gaussian\nfunction\nQT(x, z) = Q0 exp(\u2212(x\/L\u22a5)2 \u2212 (z\/L\u2016)2), (4.1)\nwhereQ0 represents the peak value of the heating source. In the numerical solutions\npresented here we take L\u2016 = 1 km. The coupled equations are to be solved subject\nto the boundary conditions n, \u03c4 \u2192 1 as |x|, |z| \u2192 \u221e. Since we cannot have an\ninfinite grid in our numerical scheme, we approximate these boundary conditions\nby requiring n = 1, \u03c4 = 1 on the boundary of our solution grid whose limits are\nmade sufficiently large so as to be effectively at infinity for the case under con-\nsideration.\nTo begin with, we assume that the background plasma is completely homo-\ngeneous. Except where stated otherwise, we use the following conditions in the\nnumerical solutions presented here:D(e)\u2016 =6 \u00d7 1012 cm2 s\u22121,D(e)\u22a5 =330 cm2 s\u22121, Ti =\n1100K, Te0 =2500K, \u03b4 =1 \u00d7 10\u22123, \u03bden =40 s\u22121. These conditions are based on night-\ntime experiments at Troms\u00f8, Norway and the high value of Te0 represents the\nobserved bulk-heating of the plasma.\nFigure 2 shows the longitudinal distributions of n and \u03c4 for striations with\nL\u22a5 = 3 m with different peak values of the heating source. It is clear that increas-\ning the heating power results in hotter striations with deeper density depletions.\nWe should stress that the large depletions indicated in this figure are not to be\nexpected in practice and only demonstrate what can be expected for a given heat\nsource. As noted above, in reality the heating source in a striation (upper-hybrid\nwaves) is a function of many processes and we do not attempt to self-consistently\nestimate it here. It can also be seen that the length of the striations increases\nwith increasing heating power. For large temperature enhancements, the decay of\ntemperature and density perturbations along the field line is no longer exponential.\nThe relationship between the peak electron temperature \u03c40, peak density depletion\nn0 and the heating power is presented in Fig. 3. The temperature enhancement\nand density depletion can be seen to be of a similar order as expected. Note\nthat the curves show some tendency towards saturation as the heating power is\nincreased.\nThe effect of changing the transverse scale size of the heating source L\u22a5 can\nbe seen in Fig. 4. The longitudinal scale of the temperature and density profiles\nL\n(T )\n\u2016 and L\n(N)\n\u2016 can be seen to increase as the striations become broader. This is\nto be expected since, for narrower striations, the effect of transverse heat diffusion\nbecomes significant compared to longitudinal diffusion and causes the perturbation\nStationary state and relaxation of artificial irregularities 325\n\u2013600 \u2013400               \u2013200 0 200 400 600\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\nz (km)\n\u03c4\n\u2013600 \u2013400 \u2013200 0 200 400 600\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nz (km)\nn\nQ\n0\n= 1.0e\u201312\nQ\n0\n= 3.0e\u201312\nQ\n0\n= 1.0e\u201311\nFigure 2.

This demonstrates that once L\u22a5 exceeds a\ncertain scale, the transverse scale no longer determines the length of striations. The\ntransverse distributions of n and \u03c4 for L\u22a5 =0.5, 1m in Fig. 4 are very similar. This\ncorresponds to the effect described in Sec. 3 that for scales L\u22a5 <L\u2217\u22a5, the transverse\nscale is dominated by diffusion rather than by the scale of the heating source.\nThese results are summarized in Fig. 5 which shows the variation of L(T )\u2016 and L\n(N)\n\u2016\nas functions of L\u22a5. Here we have defined L(T )\u2016 and L\n(N)\n\u2016 as being the e-folding\ndistances of the longitudinal profiles of \u2206\u03c4 and \u2206n, respectively.\nThe numerical approach allows us to investigate the effects of vertical inhomo-\ngeneity on the parameters of striations. As discussed in Sec. 2, we may model the\nvertical inhomogeneity bymaking the longitudinal diffusion coefficientD(e)\u2016 a linear\nfunction of z:\nD\n(e)\n\u2016 =D\n(e)(0)\n\u2016 (1 + z\/Lz) (4.2)\nwhere Lz is the vertical scale length of inhomogeneity and D\n(e)(0)\n\u2016 is the diffusion\ncoefficient at z = 0. Figure 6 shows the results of such calculations for different\nscales Lz. It is clear that for small Lz, striations are greatly elongated in the topside\nionosphere and shortened in the bottomside.\nIn Fig. 7 we have investigated the effect of different ionospheric conditions on\nthe elongation of striations. We have considered two cases intended to represent\n326 N. Borisov, A. Senior and F.

For each of these cases we have con-\nsidered two values for the bulk electron temperature Te0. These two values represent\nsituations with and without the growth of Te0 in the whole heated volume. The\ncomplete sets of conditions used are shown in Table 1. It is clear that a greater\nvalue of Te0 increases the elongation of striations in both daytime and nighttime\nconditions. The effect of the factor of two change in Te0 is quite considerable. It is\nalso evident that striations can be expected to be less elongated in daytime than\nnighttime conditions. In addition, we note that the density depletion associated\nwith the temperature enhancement is of the same order in all cases and is of the\nsame order as the temperature enhancement itself.\nIn summary, the numerical results confirm the findings of the simplified analyti-\ncal approach.

Formation of medium-sized plasma irregularities\nIt is interesting to mention that the equations presented in Sec. 2 also describe\nplasma inhomogeneities with quite different transverse scales. To demonstrate\nit in the most simple form we assume once more that the plasma is vertically\nhomogeneous and the perturbations \u2206\u03c4 , \u2206n are weak enough. We present the\ntotal plasma perturbation associated with the heating inside a striation as a sum\n\u2206n = \u2206n1 + \u2206n2, where \u2206n1 is a small-scale plasma depletion (a striation) and\n\u2206n2 is an additional inhomogeneity. Suppose that this inhomogeneity has a rather\nlarge transverse scale L(N)\u22a5 \u0001 (\u03bdei\/\u03c9He)L\n(T )\n\u2016 . We consider such an inhomogeneity\nas medium-sized. It will be shown that such inhomogeneities are weaker than\nstriations |\u2206n2|\u0002 |\u2206n1|. For small-scale perturbations the results obtained in the\nprevious sections are valid. Let us consider the distribution of the electron tem-\nperature inside a striation as a given function of coordinates \u2206\u03c4(x, z). In this case\nwe have two continuity equations, one each for electrons and ions that contain two\nunknown functions\u2206n and \u03d5. In the right-hand side of the continuity equation for\nelectrons, the temperature enhancement\u2206\u03c4 is present as the source of perturbation.\nIf the electric potential is eliminated from the continuity equations, we arrive at\n328 N.

It is important that seed plasma inhomogeneities are formed\nat the heights where striations are developed and not at the bottom of the F-layer.\nSo, self-focusing should start at such heights (in the vicinity of the UHR level).\nThis result is in agreement with the experimental data (Bakhmet\u2019eva et al. 1989).\nLater on, self-focusing causes significant elongation of medium-sized cavities. It is\npossible to expect that in stationary conditions medium-sized depletions extend up\nto 100 km below the reflection height of the pump wave as measured by Hedberg\net al. (1983).\n330 N.

Relaxation of artificial plasma irregularities\nOur results allow us to investigate the relaxation of AFAI. For this purpose we apply\na Fourier transform to the linearized continuity equations for electrons and ions\nand the heat equation. Note that time derivatives should be retained to investigate\nthe relaxation process. So we start with the following system of equations:\n\u2202\u2206nk\n\u2202t\n+ k2xD\n(e)\n\u22a5 (\u2206nk \u2212 \u03a6k + 2.5\u2206\u03c4k) + 2k2zD(e)\u2016 (\u2206nk \u2212 \u03a6k + 1.7\u2206\u03c4k) +\n\u2206nk\n\u03c4r\n= 0\n(6.1)\n\u2202\u2206nk\n\u2202t\n+ k2xD\n(i)\n\u22a5\n(\n\u2206nk +\nTe0\nTi\n\u03a6k\n)\n+ k2zD\n(i)\n\u2016\n(\n\u2206nk +\nTe0\nTi\n\u03a6k\n)\n+\n\u2206nk\n\u03c4r\n= 0 (6.2)\n\u2202\u2206\u03c4k\n\u2202t\n+ k2xD\n(e)\n\u22a5 (6.16\u2206\u03c4k + 1.5\u2206nk \u2212 1.5\u03a6k)\n+ k2zD\n(e)\n\u2016 (7.54\u2206\u03c4k + 1.4\u2206nk \u2212 1.4\u03a6k) +\n\u2206\u03c4k\n\u03c4T\n=\nQT,k\nTe0\n, (6.3)\nStationary state and relaxation of artificial irregularities 331\nwhere \u03a6k =(e\/Te0)\u03d5k, \u03c4T =(\u03b4en\u03bden)\u22121 and QT,k is the Fourier transform of the\nheating source QT. An important approximate relation follows from (6.1) and (6.2):\n\u03b7\n(\n\u2206nk +\nTe0\nTi\n\u03a6k\n)\n= \u2206nk \u2212 \u03a6k + 1.7\u2206\u03c4k, (6.4)\nwhere \u03b7 = k2xD\n(i)\n\u22a5 \/2k2zD\n(e)\n\u2016 .

Hence, the following relation between plasma per-\nturbation and electric potential applies:\n\u2206nk +\nTe0\nTi\n\u03a6k = 0. (6.5)\nFor medium-sized irregularities L(N)\u22a5 \u0001L\n(cr)\n\u22a5 the coefficient \u03b7 is small. In this case,\nanother relation is valid instead of (6.5):\n\u2206nk \u2212 \u03a6k + 1.7\u2206\u03c4k = 0.

This is in qualitative\nagreement with the experimental data (Frolov et al. 1997).\nTo investigate the relaxation of a medium-sized depletion, one should substitute\nthe relation (6.6) into (6.2), (6.3). As a result, we arrive at the equations\n\u2202\u2206nk\n\u2202t\n+\n(\n1 +\nTe0\nTi\n)(\nk2xD\n(i)\n\u22a5 +k\n2\nzD\n(i)\n\u2016\n)\n\u2206nk = \u22121.7Te0\nTi\n(\nk2xD\n(i)\n\u22a5 +k\n2\nzD\n(i)\n\u2016\n)\n\u2206\u03c4k (6.7)\n\u2202\u2206\u03c4k\n\u2202t\n+\n(\n5.2k2xD\n(e)\n\u22a5 + k\n2\nzD\n(e)\n\u2016\n)\n\u2206\u03c4k +\n\u2206\u03c4k\n\u03c4T\n=\nQT,k(t)\nTe0\n. (6.8)\nIf the heating source is switched off at t = 0, the relaxation of medium-sized de-\npletions for \u03c4r > t > \u03c4T is determined according to (6.7) by ambipolar ion diffusion\nwith coefficient (1+Te0\/Ti)D\n(i)\n\u22a5 across the magnetic field and (1+Te0\/Ti)D\n(i)\n\u2016 along\nthe magnetic field.\nTo investigate the relaxation of small-scale irregularities L(N)\u2016 \u0002L\n(cr)\n\u22a5 we substi-\ntute the relation (6.5) into (6.1), (6.3).

As the roots are\nrather complicated functions \u03b31,2 = \u03b31,2(kx, kz) the decay of a small-scale cavity\ndoes not obey the exponential law in the general case. It is important to mention\nthat the estimate for the critical length L(cr)\u22a5 and the peculiarities of the relaxation\nof small-scale and medium-sized irregularities are in qualitative agreement with the\nexperimental data (Frolov et al. 1997). The detailed comparison with experiments\nis beyond the scope of the present paper and will be carried out elsewhere.\n7. Discussion and conclusions\nThe distribution of plasma and the variation of the electron temperature in stri-\nations in stationary conditions were investigated analytically and numerically. It\nwas found that in all cases the reduced plasma perturbation in striations \u2206n is of\nthe order of the variation of the electron temperature |\u2206n| \u223c \u2206\u03c4. This means that\nit is impossible to expect a stationary state of striations with strongly enhanced\nelectron temperature and very weak plasma depletion. The in-situ observations of\nPeria et al. (1999) and Kelley et al. (1995) at Arecibo indicate striations with plasma\ndepletions on the order of 6% and electron temperature enhancements of \u223c100K,\nwhich is likely to be of a similar order as the plasma depletion when the ambient\nelectron temperature is taken into account. This is in good agreement with our\ntheoretical predictions. At the same time this result does not prevent a significant\nincrease of the electron temperature Te0 within the heated volume compared to the\nundisturbed temperature. Such an increase is measured by incoherent scattering\n(Robinson et al. 1997; Leyser et al. 2000). A possible mechanism of anomalous heat\ntransfer from striations to the whole heated volume will be discussed in a separate\npaper.\nWe have estimated the typical length of striations as \u223c(1\u20132) \u00d7 102 km. This is\nmuch larger than estimated before (Rao and Thome 1974; Korovin et al. 1983;\nJones et al. 1984; Kelley et al. 1995; Frolov et al. 1997). Such an elongation is\nconnected to a strong localized heat outflow (mainly upward) along the magnetic\nfield line.\nOur conclusion is based on the assumption that the ionospheric turbulence in\nthe heated volume does not influence the longitudinal diffusion of striations. This\ninfluence could be twofold. First, it might happen that striations are destroyed due\nStationary state and relaxation of artificial irregularities 333\nto instabilities before they reach their stationary state. In this case, the real lifetime\nof striations is much smaller than the recombination lifetime \u03c4r. Second, due to the\nexcitation of plasma turbulence in striations, the usual electron collision frequency\n\u03bdei should be substituted by some effective collision frequency \u03bd\n(eff)\ne which grows\nwith the intensity of the excited waves and can exceed the frequency \u03bdei many\ntimes. Thus, the longitudinal diffusion and the length of striations are reduced\nsignificantly. To find confirmation of this effect, accurate measurements of the\nlength of striations are desirable.\nWe have found numerically how the length of a striation depends on its transverse\nscale L(N)\u22a5 . For small values of L\n(N)\n\u22a5 its increase causes the elongation of striations.\nThis result is in accordance with the experimental data (Frolov et al. 1997). For\nthe scales L(N)\u22a5 > 5\u20136 m, the length of a striation does not depend on its transverse\nscale. At the same time the elongation depends on the vertical scale of plasma\ninhomogeneity Lz and the increase of the bulk temperature of electrons within\nthe heated volume. The higher the temperature Te0, the stronger the elongation of\nstriations.\nWe have discussed the formation of seed medium-sized irregularities in the vi-\ncinity of striations. We predict that depletions start to grow at the heights where\nstriations are formed and later on become more and more elongated due to the\nthermal self-focusing. The predicted dynamics of the medium-sized depletions and\ntheir elongation are in qualitative agreement with the experimental data (Hedberg\net al. 1983; Bakhmet\u2019eva et al. 1989).\nFinally, we have investigated the relaxation of small-scale L(N)\u22a5 <L\n(cr)\n\u22a5 artificial\nplasma irregularities (striations) and we have confirmed theoretically the appear-\nance of two time scales that determine the decay of small-scale irregularities that\nis often seen in experiments (Frolov et al., 1997). A more detailed investigation of\nthe relaxation of small-scale irregularities and comparison with observations will\nbe the subject of a future paper.\nAcknowledgement\nAS is supported by a research studentship from the UK\u2019s Particle Physics and\nAstronomy Research Council.\nReferences\nBakhmet\u2019eva, N.
