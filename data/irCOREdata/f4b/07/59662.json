Introduction \nSurges in UK waters are generally caused by strong winds due to mid-latitude \ndepressions passing over the UK from the Atlantic.  Currents in the sea are \naccelerated due to variations in the atmospheric pressure gradient and also as a result \nof wind-stress (Gill, 1982).  Wind-stress generates flow perpendicular to the forcing \nstress as a result of Ekman dynamics. When this Ekman flow is towards the coast, \nwater piles up, increasing the mean water level.  Around the UK the surge typically \nbehaves as a forced Kelvin wave (Gill, 1982), travelling anti-clockwise around a \nsemi-enclosed sea, with the coast on the right.   \n \nLennon (1963) suggested that major west coast storm surges are caused by Atlantic \nsecondary depressions passing from SW to NE over the northern part of the British \nIsles at a critical speed of about 40 knots. Thus the spatial and temporal scales of \nthese surges are smaller than those experienced in the North Sea. The wind-stress is \nmost effective at producing a surface elevation gradient in shallow water. Depths in \nthe eastern Irish Sea are only about 40m on average and thus this area is prone to \nlarge surges which may cause flooding in low-lying coastal areas.  Local surge \ngeneration in the eastern Irish Sea results from a simple force balance due to the \nsurge-generating winds being predominantly from the W and NW and the simple \ngeometry of the coastline (see Figs. 1 and 2) but the external surge is also important \ni.e. surge generation in the southern Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and SW Approaches (Jones \nand Davies, 1998).  \n \nLarge surges at Liverpool can be up to 2.5m: one example is the November 1977 \nsurge which was almost 2m at Liverpool (Wolf, 2008). For the purpose of coastal \nflooding it is the maximum of total water level which is important. The maximum \ntidal range at Liverpool exceeds 10m and thus dominates in terms of the timing of the \npeak of total water level; however the maximum surge residual at Liverpool generally \ndoes not fall on high water due to tide-surge interaction (Woodworth and Blackman, \n2002).  \n \nDuring the night of 11th and 12th November 1977 a severe storm coinciding with \ntidal high water overtopped coastal defences throughout Lancashire and Cumbria. \nSimulations of the November 1977 surge event (Davies and Jones, 1998) show that \nfor surges in Liverpool Bay the flow into the Irish Sea through the North Channel and \nCeltic Sea (the external surge) is about equally as important as the locally generated \nsurge. In the January 2007 event the maximum surge in Liverpool reached 2.23m.  \nThis is the second largest surge event in the last 10 years.  The largest reached 2.6m \non the 27th October 2002, but no wave data were recorded and there are limited surge \ndata due to gauge failure.  Liverpool Bay is sheltered from swell waves from the \nAtlantic and experiences locally wind-generated sea. Waves have been recorded in \nLiverpool Bay from November 2002 to the present (Wolf, 2008). The wave height \ntypically exceeds 3m during 5\u221210 events per year and exceeds 4m from 1\u22125 times per \nyear. The largest waves and surges in Liverpool Bay are generated by westerly and \nnorth-westerly winds which have the longest fetch. \n \nWave conditions may also be critical to coastal flooding, through overtopping of sea \ndefences and low-lying areas.  Wind waves are the mechanism through which the \nwind-stress interacts with the sea surface. When wind blows over the sea wind waves \nimmediately start to grow, increasing in period and height with time, and also a mean \nflow is generated. These effects are linked with turbulent processes in the air and \nwater boundary layers. Bulk parameterisations of the surface drag implicitly take \naccount of the effect of waves (as drag increases with wind speed) but local \nconditions may mean that waves are not in equilibrium with the wind so it is of \ninterest to model surge and waves simultaneously and examine their interactions. \n \nIn surge models the Smith and Banke (1975) formula (S&B) is frequently used to \nparameterise the wind-stress, but this formula has been found to under-predict the \nsurge conditions in the southern North Sea (Mastenbroek et al. 1993; Williams and \nFlather, 2000).  Williams and Flather (2000) found it necessary to enhance the wind \nby a factor of 1.1 (equivalent to replacing U10 by U25) to get good surge forecasts. \nThis may be related to the spatial model resolution in that the surge generation in \nshallow areas is poorly represented. The Charnock (1955) relationship is an \nalternative formula, which is used in the operational surge model at Proudman \nOceanographic Laboratory (CS3).   Janssen (1989, 1991, 2004), Janssen et al. (2004) \nand Mastenbroek et al. (1993) have all investigated representing the surface stress in \nthe presence of waves by a Charnock-like method in place of S&B.  Mastenbroek et \nal. (1993) studied the effect of using the wave stress in a coupled wave-current model \ncompared to using S&B in a surge model.  They found it performed well for young \nand old seas compared to S&B.  By using a Charnock relationship with \u03b1 = 0.032 in a \nsurge model they could reproduce the effects of using a coupled wave-surge model.  \nUsing a constant Charnock value in the surge model allows the stress to be tuned to \nobtain the desired surge levels at a particular location. However the optimum value \nmay vary with location.  It is thought the Charnock parameter is related to wave-age \n(Drennan et al., 2005).  Here we aim to (i) use a consistent surface stress computation \nfor wave and surge model and (ii) replace the constant value Charnock parameter with \na wave-dependent parameter such that a global representation of the surface stress is \nobtained, without the need for tuning.  Ideally we would like to use the same wind-\nstress in the surge and wave models (Mastenbroek, et al., 1993).   \n  \nWe use the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Modelling System \n(POLCOMS) as the surge model and the 3rd-generation spectral Wave Model \n(WAM).  The November 1977 and January 2007 storm surge events have been used \nto study surge prediction in the eastern Irish Sea using both a coupled wave-tide-surge \n(POLCOMS-WAM) model and a tide-surge (POLCOMS) model.  These two hindcast \nevents have been simulated, to (i) investigate the effects of waves on the surge \ngeneration by modifying the surface drag and (ii) optimise the Charnock parameter \nwithout waves for the eastern Irish Sea.  We modify POLCOMS such that a consistent \nformulation to WAM is applied for stress, which also facilitates coupling of the wave \nand surge models. A set of metrics for testing the models goodness of fit have been \ndesigned.    We have tested the model set up by implementing various stress \nformulations in the POLCOMS model.  The model set up and hindcast events are \npresented in section 2.  The surge predictions are shown in section 3.  Different \ncoupled and uncoupled methods were tried to represent the surface stress in \nPOLCOMS to best simulate the surge residuals at coastal tide gauges.  The findings \nare discussed in section 4 with the focus mainly on Liverpool Bay.  We conclude in \nsection 5 that it is important to retain the wave-age dependence of the wave model via \nthe Charnock parameter to produce appropriate stress for storm surges in Liverpool \nBay, when using POLCOMS-WAM. A problem in the implementation of the wave \nstress in WAM for limited fetch and shallow seas has come to light, which does not \noccur for much larger wave-ages e.g. global WAM applications.  \n \n2. Method \n2.1. Model set up \nIn order to accurately simulate the waves in the study area, we use the state-of-the-art \n3rd-generation spectral Wave Model (WAM, Komen et al., 1994) modified for \nshallow water (Monbaliu et al., 2000). To allow investigation of the influence of \nexternally generated waves generated propagating into the study area, a one-way \nnested model approach has been set up as follows.  A 1\u00ba North Atlantic model forces \nthe boundary of a 1.85km Irish Sea model (Fig. 1), so that any influence that swell \nmight have in the study area will be included.  To capture the external surge effects \ngenerated outside of the Irish Sea a one-way nested approach (Fig. 1b) from a 1\/9\u00ba by \n1\/6\u00ba Atlantic margin model to the 1.8km Irish Sea model, using POLCOMS (Holt and \nJames, 2001) has been applied.  POLCOMS is a 3-dimensional hydrodynamic model, \nwhich can simulate both the barotropic and baroclinic processes, which arise from the \ntides, meteorological and riverine forcing (although density effects have not been \nincluded here).  A 3-dimensional model is required to represent the vertical structure \nof the wind-induced currents (Jones and Davies, 1998).  For the Irish Sea model \nwave-tide-surge interaction has been taken into account by 2-way coupling of \nPOLCOMS and WAM (Osuna and Wolf, 2005).  The coupling is achieved through \nthe surface and bottom stress and wave refraction due to the presence of time varying \ncurrent and elevation fields (Wolf et al., 2002). \n \nFor the November 1977 event the coarse grid models were driven by six-hourly, ~1\u00ba \nresolution ECMWF (ERA-40) wind and pressure data.  For the fine resolution Irish \nSea model higher resolution (both spatially, 1\/2\u00ba by 1\/3\u00ba, and temporally, 3 hourly) \nwind and pressure data (Jones and Davies, 1998) were used to drive the model to \nsimulate the wave and surge conditions. For the January 2007 event hourly wind and \npressure data (referred to as mesoscale data) were provided by the UK Met Office \nNorth East Atlantic model, with a resolution of 1\/9\u00ba by 1\/6\u00ba (~ 12km).  The tides were \nincluded at the open boundary using the 15 constituents available in POLCOMS (Q1, \nO1, P1, S1, K1, 2N2, MU2, N2, NU2, M2, L2, T2, S2, K2 and M4).  We then define \nthe predicted surge elevation as the residual water level i.e. difference between the \ntotal elevation and the tidal elevation (from the model). \n \nIn the POLCOMS-WAM model the minimum water depth was set to 5m with \nimproved bathymetric data (NOOS data set: Zijderveld and Verlaan, 2004) in the \neastern Irish Sea.  This allowed resolution of the coastal bathymetric features, but \nprevented numerical instability with drying areas occurring in the model domain due \nto the tidal variations.  Initial simulations with the standard 10m minimum depth \ndemonstrated the importance of including shallow areas, since a 10\u221230% increase in \nthe peak surge elevation resulted at the shallow locations with this reduced minimum \ndepth.  Further work is planned using a \u2018wetting and drying\u2019 scheme, which will \neliminate the need to fix a minimum depth.   \n \n2.2. Representing the wind-stress \nWe use POLCOMS with 6 vertical levels as a tide-surge model and as the \nhydrodynamic module of a coupled wave-current model.  Depth-varying currents are \ncalculated in the baroclinic mode (with constant density).  The barotropic component \nsolves the depth-averaged shallow water equations: \n( ) ( ) 0=\u03b6+\u2202\n\u2202+\u03b6+\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u03b6\u2202 vh\ny\nuh\nxt\n                                                                              (1) \n( ) ( )\u03b6+\u03c1\n\u03c4+\u03b6+\u03c1\n+\u2212\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03c1\u2212=\u2202\n\u03b6\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202\nhh\nvuuk\nx\npfv\nx\ng\ny\nuv\nx\nuu\nt\nu\nw\nx\nw\na\nw\n221                           (2) \n( ) ( )\u03b6+\u03c1\n\u03c4+\u03b6+\u03c1\n+\u2212\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03c1\u2212\u2212=\u2202\n\u03b6\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202\nhh\nvuvk\ny\npfu\ny\ng\ny\nvv\nx\nvu\nt\nv\nw\ny\nw\na\nw\n221                         (3) \nwhere t = time, u,v = the depth-mean velocity components in x- and y-direction \nrespectively, \u03b6 = surface elevation, h = water depth, g = gravitational acceleration, f = \nCoriolis parameter, k = quadratic bottom friction coefficient, \u03c4x,y = wind-stress in x- \nand y-direction respectively, \u03c1w = water density and pa = atmospheric pressure at sea \nlevel.   \n \nSince the 1950\u2019s it has generally been accepted that the wind profile in the \natmospheric boundary layer can be represented by a logarithmic law which appears \nvery robust (Charnock, 1955).  With the development of high frequency recording \ndevices such as the sonic anemometer it has been possible to directly measure the \nsurface stress (Reynold\u2019 stress) by means of eddy correlation and\/or dissipation \nmethods from the turbulent velocity fluctuations e.g. Smith and Banke (1975) and \nTaylor and Yelland (2001).  These have led to various parameterisations of the stress \nin terms of the more readily available wind-speed at 10m above the sea surface, U10, \ngiving the much-used empirical bulk formula such as S&B, and Wu (1982), among \nothers.  \n \nWind stress, \u03c4, depends on the air density, \u03c1a, and friction velocity, u*, which is \nrelated to the wind speed at 10m, U10, by u*\n2 = CD U102, where CD = a drag coefficient \n(Janssen, 2004): \n2\n10\n2\n* uCu Daa \u03c1=\u03c1=\u03c4                       (4) \nThe S&B formula: ( ) 310 10066.063.0 \u2212\u00d7+= UCD                    (5) \nwas developed for winds up to 21m\/s unlike the Charnock  relation that holds for light \n(<15m\/s) and high (up to 60m\/s) wind conditions and therefore a range of sea states \n(Wu, 1982).  To correctly model the wind-stress in Eqs. (2) and (3) we need to select \nan appropriate roughness length z0.  Charnock (1955) parameterised the roughness \nlength, z0, on dimensional grounds.  By assuming momentum transfer from air to \nocean is mainly through short surface gravity waves, then the roughness length is \nscaled by the acceleration of gravity, g, and u*: \ng\nuz\n2\n*\n0\n\u03b1=                         (6) \nThe Charnock parameter, \u03b1, is thought to be related to wave-age (Janssen, 2004), \nalthough this has been disputed (Taylor and Yelland, 2001), but it is often treated as \nconstant in models with values between 0.0112 and 0.035 (Wu, 1980).  Although \u03b1 = \n0.0185 seems to provide accurate representation of the surface stress for all sea states \n(Wu, 1982), a  larger value is imposed for young (steep) wind-seas due to increased \nwave-wind coupling (Janssen, 1991) in WAM. In the wave model \u03b1 is \u2018wave-age\u2019 \ndependent, thus varies in time and space.  A higher value (0.0275) has also been \nfound to be appropriate for surge modelling (Williams and Flather, 2000).  This \nresearch aims to find the optimum constant and wave-dependent value for the eastern \nIrish Sea. \n \nIn the wave model applied here (WAM) Janssen\u2019s (1991) method is used to predict \nthe effective roughness length, ze, of the sea surface as follows.   He assumes that the \nwind profile has logarithmic shape for all sea states: \n( ) \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n+\n+\n\u03ba= 10\n1* ln\nzz\nzzuzU                                                                                                   (7) \nwhere \u03ba = von Karman\u2019s constant. The profile depends on a background roughness \n(capillary waves), z0, which accounts for processes such as flow separation that are \nnot considered explicitly.  This roughness length is parameterised by a Charnock \nrelation: \ng\nuz\n2\n*\n0\n\u03b1\u02c6=  , where \u03b1\u02c6=constant                                                                                     \n(8) \nThis is combined with the roughness length due to (short) gravity waves, z1, to give \nthe effective roughness, ze = z0 + z1. The effective roughness is calculated in the wave \nmodel by a Charnock-like relation: \ng\nuze\n2\n*\u03b1= , where \u03c4\n\u03c4\u2212\u03b1=\u03b1 w1\u02c6                                                                              (9) \nwhere \u03c4w = the wave stress and \u03c4 = the total wind stress given by Eq. (5).  The \nconstant \u03b1  was selected by trial and error as 0.01, so for old wind-seas \u03b1 = 0.0185 in \nEq. (9), in agreement with observations collected by Wu (1982).  Wave-age (cp\/u*) is \nused to measure the stage of development of the wind sea.  A wave spectrum with \nrelatively high peak frequency is termed \u2018young\u2019 (cp\/u* ~ 10) and refers to a sea state \nwhere the waves have just been generated by the wind.  A saturated sea state is \ntermed \u2018old\u2019 (cp\/u* ~ 30) and the wave energy hardly changes in time (Janssen, 1989).  \nFor old wind-seas ze \u2248 z0 (the effective roughness is equivalent to that obtained \nwithout wave effects) and the stress behaves according to constant Charnock if \u03c4w\/\u03c4 is \nsmall, but as \u03c4w\/\u03c4 tends to one the stress is enhanced i.e. accounting for steep waves \npresent in young wind-seas (Mastenbroek et al., 1993).  \n\u02c6\n \nThe surface drag coefficient in the standard POLCOMS model was taken from S&B.  \nFor compatibility with the wave model a Charnock relation has now been \nimplemented.  In the latter case the surface roughness length, z0, may be derived if the \nCharnock parameter is specified, or provided by the wave model through u*, thus \nusing the same wind-stress in the surge module as in the wave module.  We wish to \nuse a consistent drag law for both models, so that the effective roughness still gives \nthe correct answer for \u2018old\u2019 wind-sea, in agreement with bulk formula (i.e. the no \nwave case using S&B or Charnock), but is modified for \u2018young\u2019 wind-sea.  Here, we \nimpose CD using u* from the wave model, but an iterative method could be used to \nobtain CD from ze.  Subtle differences may occur due to the different numerics.   \n \n2.3. The hindcast surge events \nTwo significant surge events in Liverpool Bay have been simulated using the Irish \nSea model.  The eastern Irish Sea provides a simple test case in terms of geometry and \nnegligible swell influence.  The first is the November 1977 surge and the second the \nJanuary 2007 surge.  The model domain with locations of tide gauges and wave buoys \nduring the events is shown in Fig. 2.  Only coastal tide gauge data are available \npresently for validation of the surge.  In the future pressure gauges located at the \nLiverpool Bay Coastal Observatory* stations may also be used to validate the offshore \nsurge.  \n   \nThe period 7th \u221217th November 1977 is a well-studied event due to the occurrence of \ntwo significantly different surge events (Jones and Davies, 1998).  The first surge \noccurred on the 11th \u221212th November and was the result of an atmospheric depression \n                                                 \n* Coastal Observatory web link: http:\/\/cobs.pol.ac.uk\/ \ncrossing the region from west to east to the north of Scotland before moving on to \nnorthern Norway.  The second surge occurred over a longer period during the 13th \n\u221215th November and was in response to a less common, more southerly-tracking \ndepression that moved from the west coast of Scotland to Denmark.  In the first case \n16m\/s south-westerly winds in the eastern Irish Sea increased to 22m\/s and veered \nround to the west (Fig. 3a).  In the second instance, 15m\/s north-westerly winds, \nincreasing to 22\u221225m\/s, off the west coast of Scotland, forced water through the \nNorthern Channel into the eastern Irish Sea, where the winds varied between \n16\u221219m\/s (Fig. 3b) (Jones and Davies, 1998).  Surge elevation data obtained at five \ncoastal tide gauges (Fig. 2) in the eastern Irish Sea during these events have been used \nto validate the model.  \n \nJones and Davies (1998) show the local surge in the eastern Irish Sea is dominated by \nthe external surge through the North Channel and from the Celtic Sea.  The internally \ngenerated surge, due to the winds in the eastern Irish Sea, has a lower (< 0.5m) \ncontribution to the total surge.  During this event the tide was approaching the peak of \nmaximum spring tide.  The correspondingly large variation in water depth had a \nsignificant impact on the surge.    \n \nThe surge on the 18th January 2007 occurred due a depression travelling east to the \nnorth of Ireland and across Scotland.  This caused 12m\/s south westerly winds in the \nIrish Sea that increased in intensity to 18m\/s and veered to the west reaching \nvelocities of 22m\/s before dying away (Fig. 4).  The tide was mid-way into the spring \ntidal phase so although the tidal range was large the variation in water depth was not \nas extreme as in the 1977 surge event, so the tidal influence on the surge was reduced.  \nData to validate the surge were available at seven ports in the eastern Irish Sea and a \nwave buoy\u2020 provided wave height, Hs, and period, Tp, in Liverpool Bay. The locations \nare shown in Fig. 2. During this surge event the waves reached a peak height of 4.95m \nwith a peak period of 11.43s at the wave buoy location.   \n \n2.4. External Surge Calibration \nDue to lack of high resolution large scale wind data for the 1977 event POLCOMS \nwas used to predict the tide-surge boundary conditions for the Irish Sea model using \nthe ECMWF 1\u02da wind data.  We found that POLCOMS under-predicted the external \nsurge as a result of under-estimation of wind-speed due to low grid resolution and the \nuse of S&B with U10 (the reasoning behind S&B under-predicting the surge will be \ndiscussed more fully later).  The predicted POLCOMS boundary conditions were \ntherefore adjusted using tide gauge data at Ilfracombe and Malin, two coastal tide \ngauges close to the Irish Sea model boundary, using linear regression.  This tuning \nwas applied to the total water elevation at the boundary.  Adding the tidal prediction \nof POLCOMS to the surge data at the two coastal tide gauges to obtain the total \nelevation meant that this method was indirectly tuning the predicted surge around the \nboundary.  A different regression was found for the north and south boundary as \nshown in Fig. 5.  The regression formulae were applied to the full length of both \nboundaries, with scaling along the boundary consistent with the model forcing.  Surge \nelevation at Castletownsend confirmed that the regression formula applied at \nIlfracombe would be sufficient to tune the full extent of the southern boundary.  A \n                                                 \n\u2020 WaveNet web link: http:\/\/map.cefasdirect.co.uk\/wavenet.asp\n \ncontinuity correction was then applied to the current velocities to preserve the water \nflux (u1(h1+\u03b6)= u2(h2+\u03b6)) driving the velocity components at the boundaries.  \n  \nDuring the second (lower) surge on the 15th November, linked with winds veering to \nthe northwest, the external surge through the North Channel appeared to be under-\npredicted.  Fig. 5 shows the tuned results are biased to lower levels during the second \nevent.  For this reason we have only investigated the initial surge event defined as the \n48 hour period from midday on the 10th November until midday on the 12th \nNovember.  For the 2007 event the Operational Surge model at POL (CS3X) was \nused to provide the external boundary forcing, since it is tuned for accurate surge \nprediction using a Charnock relation (Williams and Flather, 2000).  Tide gauge data at \nPort Rush and Ilfracombe confirmed that the boundary forcing (external surge) was \nadequately modelled using the CS3X.  \n \n2.5. Model Accuracy \nWith regard to coastal flooding, it is the peak in the total water level which is of most \ninterest and requires accurate prediction.  Due to model limitations the modelled tide \nwill always contain errors due to the number of constituents included within the \nsimulation and the grid resolution. The operational model thus uses harmonic tidal \npredictions at each coastal station added to the surge residual to give more accurate \ntotal water levels. In this case we are interested in the predicted surge (due to \nmeteorological forcing) rather than the total water level.  Fig. 6 shows the times of \nhigh water in relation to the (residual) surge elevation during the November 1977 \nsurge event.  The tidal modulation in the surge elevation shows how strong the tide-\nsurge interaction is in the eastern Irish Sea.  Generally, the peaks in surge avoid high \nwater (Wolf, 1981; Horsburgh and Wilson, 2007). Interestingly the maximum surge \noccurs on the rising tide everywhere, except at Liverpool for the 1977 event only.  A \ntiming error in the tide gauge data during this initial event is therefore suspected.    \n \nThe surge (actual or modelled) is defined here as the residual water level, i.e. the total \n(measured or modelled) water level minus the (predicted or modelled) tidal elevation.  \nSince the (residual) surge is less extreme during high water (Fig. 6) the \u2018skew surge\u2019 \nbecomes more important in flood risk management, since it gives an idea of how \naccurately the absolute water level above tidal high water is forecast (de Vries et al., \n1995).  Skew surge is the difference between the peaks in total water level and the \nnearest astronomical high tide level.  Tide-surge interaction modifies the time of tidal \nhigh water, thus the absolute water level relative to predicted high water and not the \nresidual water level is of more interest.  The difference between the modelled and \nmeasured skew surge provides a measure of how accurately the peak total water \nelevation through time was predicted.  We aim to accurately model the hindcast wind-\ndriven surge events discussed in section 2.3.  Here we therefore concentrate on the \n(residual) surge, since this represents surge at all states of the tide.  \n \nTo quantify the model performance we use three output metrics designed to assess the \nmodel accuracy through time.  We also look at the RMS error of both the residual and \nskew surge and the bias in the peaks in (residual) surge.  Although the RMS error \nprovides an estimate of the model accuracy (averaged through time) it does not \nrepresent how significant this error is compared to the data.  We have therefore \ndeveloped an RMS percentage error function.  This provides a measure of the \n\u2018goodness of fit\u2019 between the model and the data.  The effect of a large error is \nenhanced through the squaring of the error, rewarding a good prediction and \npunishing a poor prediction.  The size of the error is then compared to the variation in \nthe data; again the effect of a large range is enhanced by squaring the range.  In the \nfollowing functions D = the data, M = the corresponding model prediction and the \noverbar indicates the mean value of the data set. The first function (trend error \nfunction, TEF), which is similar to a cost function (Holt et al., 2005), is defined as: \n( )\n( )\n( )\u2211\n\u2211\n\u2211 =\n=\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\n\u00d7= N\nn\nn\nN\nn\nnn\nN\nn\nn\nDD\nMD\nDD\nN\nRMSTEF\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n100\n1\nerror  100                                                      (10) \nThis has been applied to the residual surge prediction.  This metric provides an overall \ngoodness of fit but does not discriminate the finer details.  In shallow areas with large \ntidal range (as in Liverpool Bay) the surge level is strongly controlled by water depth.  \nWe therefore use two quantities to assess the absolute error in (i) the peak residual \nsurge, which typically occurs near low water and (ii) the skew surge, which occurs \nclose to high water when the surge set-up is close to minimum due to inverse water \ndepth effects.  To assess these two quantities we use a second function (peak error \nfunction, PEF), which is similar to a percentage model bias function (Allen et al., \n2007), defined as: \nD\nMD\nNPEF\nN\nn\nnn\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\u02c61\n100 1\n\u2211\n=\n\u2212\n= ,                                                                                      (11) \nwhere the circumflex indicates that only values at the peaks in either the residual \n(PEF-residual) surge or total water level (skew surge values, PEF-skew) are \nconsidered.  The absolute value is taken to prevent averaging reducing the overall \nerror.  The size of the error is then compared to the size of the peak values to \nnormalise the error. This function has been applied to the peaks in the residual surge \nto see how well the maximum surge (during low water level) is modelled, and also to \nthe skew surge to see how well the surge is modelled at high water, when flood risk is \ngreatest.  The absolute error in the peak (residual) surge is considered the best \nmeasure of the effect of the wind-stress through time, thus we use the PEF-residual to \ndetermine which model set up is most accurate at surge prediction. This quantity is a \nmeasure of the model performance at low water and ignores any errors due to phase \ndifferences, which is considered unimportant operationally (de Vries et al., 1995).  \n \nWe have spatially averaged (across five tide gauge locations in the area of interest) \nthe magnitude of the accuracy measures over a 48-hour period (12:00 10th \u2212 12:00 \n12th November) in 1977 and a 24-hour period (00:00 18th \u2013 00:00 19th January) in \n2007.  These average quantities allow assessment of how well the model predicts (i) \nthe peaks in a surge event (close to low water), (ii) the peaks in total water level (close \nto high water) and (iii) the surge level over one or two tidal cycles, across a region of \nvarying topography.  These measures access more than one time instant hence the \neffects of variations in the wave field and depth are accounted for. \n \nWe now aim to tune POLCOMS to obtain the optimum (residual) surge prediction \nthat is valid for different surge events and different locations around the eastern Irish \nSea, obtaining a globally valid model set up for any wind condition. \n \n3. Results \nPOLCOMS-WAM was used to hindcast the November 1977 storm surge event.  The \nmodel was tuned to obtain the most accurate (regional) surge prediction across five \ncoastal tide gauges in the eastern Irish Sea.  To validate the new model set up the \nJanuary 2007 event was then simulated using a subset of the initial model \nconfigurations. \n \n3.1. Wave model results \nThe wave model accurately modelled Hs and Tm02 during the 2007 surge event (Fig. \n7), with an RMS error of 0.63m and 0.73s respectively, an R2 value of 0.83 and 0.70 \nrespectively, a bias in the wave height of 0.08m and a bias in Tm02 wave period of \n\u22120.24s. Compared to the 2007 event the waves during the 1977 event were lower \n(Fig. 8).  By including external wave boundary forcing in 1977 (Fig. 9) we have also \ndemonstrated that external swell propagating into the Irish Sea has an insignificant \ninfluence in the eastern Irish Sea.  This is due to the sheltering effects of the coastline \nwithin the eastern Irish Sea and Liverpool Bay in particular.  Centrally and in the \nsouth of the Irish Sea external waves propagating through St George\u2019s Channel are \nimportant.  The narrow width of the North Channel prevents significant external wave \npropagation into the northern Irish Sea. \n \n3.1.1 WAM model fix \nThe conditions in the eastern Irish Sea prevent \u2018old waves\u2019 occurring at the time of \npeak surge (Fig. 10). Janssen (1989) demonstrates that for very young wave \nconditions (cp\/u* <15) in the absence of swell \u03c4w\/\u03c4 > 1, where \u03c4w is the wave related \nstress and \u03c4 is defined by Eq. (4).  Since this is physically unrealistic an upper limit \n(\u03c4w\/\u03c4 \u22640.999) is imposed to prevent numerical instability in the computation of \u03b1 in \nWAM.  This model application tests the robustness of the wave-dependent Charnock \nparameter and computation procedure in WAM when applied to enclosed seas.   \n \nIn the eastern Irish Sea wind conditions exceeding ~18m\/s combined with no swell \ninfluence should force the Charnock-like parameter to reaches its upper limit \u03b1 = 0.31 \n(equivalent to \u03c4w\/\u03c4 \u22640.999) Figs. 11 and 12.  The computation method updates \u03b1, u* \nand ze using \u03c4w from the previous time step before re-calculating \u03c4w.  WAM uses \u03c4w,t-1 \nto predict \u03c4t  and forces \u03c4w,t-1\/\u03c4t < 0.99999, where subscript t = time, thus at the stage \nwhen \u03b1, u* and ze are calculated \u03c4w,t-1\/\u03c4 t is less than unity and no limit is applied \nallowing realistic values to be computed for application in the surge model.  The \nresulting \u03b1 value is shown in the bottom panels of Figs. 11 and 12 compared with the \nconstant \u03b1 value (0.0185) proposed by Wu (1982) to be accurate for all wind \nconditions (sea states). \n \nAt times of peak surge, wave-age dependence is maintained in the surface roughness \nacross the Irish Sea and not imposed as a constant limiting value.  This is due to the \nsequence of computations in WAM.  Predicting the total surface stress before \nupdating the total wave stress prevents \u03b1 taking its upper limit (Fig. 13), therefore \nwave-age does influence the surge prediction and realistic u* and ze values are \ncomputed, although the updated \u03c4w exceeds \u03c4 (Fig. 14).  In the global WAM model a \nrange of \u03b1 = 0.01\u22120.05 is found for U10 = 1\u221225m\/s (Bidlot and Janssen, 2003) and \nwave-ages (cp \/u*) > 15 (Janssen, 2004).  Due to the asymptotic nature of \u03b1 its value \nrapidly increases for young-waves.  We show that during surge conditions the very \nyoung waves in the eastern Irish Sea lead to larger \u03b1 values (up to 0.07) (Fig. 13).  As \nlong as ze (in place of z0) or u* is transferred to the surge model then accurate results \nare achieved, but if \u03c4w \/ \u03c4 is transferred unrealistically large Charnock parameters, and \nthus surge elevations, will result.  The following figures are for the time of the peak \nsurge.  Fig. 13 shows that with increasing fetch the waves become older, except \nwithin Liverpool Bay where the waves decrease in age due to shoaling (Taylor and \nYelland, 2001).  There is a steep gradient in \u03b1 along the east coast of Ireland, due to \nthe sheltering effect of land on the wind. The variation in \u03b1 across the Irish Sea \nassociated with wave-age (\u03c4w\/\u03c4), may not be accurate for short fetches and young seas, \nfor example along the east coast of Ireland (Taylor and Yelland, 2001).  The relatively \nsteep waves have low wave height, the two effects thus cancelling each other out to \ncreate a roughness similar (or slightly less) than for longer fetches.  This effect is not \nseen here, since wave height is not accounted for.  However, in shoaling conditions as \nin Liverpool Bay, the roughness will be significantly increased (Taylor and Yelland, \n2001).   \n \nWhen computing z1 (defined in Eq. (7)) using Eq. (6) to obtain the high-frequency \ncontribution to the wave stress, the standard code within WAM sets an upper limit for \n\u03b11 = 0.1, where \u03b11 = \u03b1 \u2212 , and \u03b1  = 0.01.  Under limiting conditions this leads to \ninconsistent \u03b1 and u* values used to calculate ze.  Bidlot and Janssen (2003) improved \nthe numerical evaluation of the high-frequency contribution to the wave stress and \ntotal stress by doubling the resolution of total stress look-up table, along with \nincreasing the upper limit of \u03b11 to 0.2.  Here, we have imposed the table resolution of \nBidlot and Janssen (2003) and also imposed an upper limit of \u03b11 = 0.3 to obtain \nconsistent ze and u* values. \n\u03b1\u02c6 \u02c6\n \n3.2. November 1977 event \nThe surge in Liverpool Bay during November 1977 was predicted using different \nrepresentations of the surface stress in POLCOMS.  The model was initially run using \nstand-alone POLCOMS.  The surface stress was predicted using S&B with U10 and \n1.1U10 (~U25) as shown in Fig. 15.  A 10% enhancement of the winds is thought to be \nacceptable since the biggest uncertainty is in wind prediction.  It was found that for \nthe deeper coastal tide gauges (Douglas and Workington) that the enhanced wind \nvelocity improved the peak surge prediction.  For the shallower coastal tide gauges \n(Heysham, Hilbre and Liverpool) the standard wind speed performed better.  \n \nThese two stress relationships can be well approximated by using the Charnock \nmethod with (different) constant values (Fig. 15).  The first, \u03b1 = 0.0275, is the same as \nthat used in the CS3 model and corresponds to S&B U25.  The second, \u03b1 = 0.0144 is \nthe same as that used by Janssen (1988) and represents S&B U10.  Implementing the \nCharnock procedure in POLCOMS allows the model to be coupled to WAM, while \nhaving the option to keep the surface stress computation decoupled. Use of a \nCharnock-type surface stress parameterisation in both of the models allows more \nconsistency in the surface stress computation.  Other wave-current interactions are \nalso included (e.g. the enhancement of bottom friction due to waves).  Fig. 15 and \nTable 1 illustrate that the influence of waves on the surge prediction is negligible \nwhen the surface stress is decoupled.  This is contradictory to the results of Jones and \nDavies (1998).  Thus, it is more computationally efficient, and of similar accuracy, to \nrun a hydrodynamic model with a tuned Charnock parameter for a specific location \nrather than running a coupled wave-current model. \n \nAt all five locations S&B with U10 is better at predicting the initial stages (peaks) of \nthe surge.  As the winds increase through time S&B with U10 remains more accurate \nat the shallower coastal tide gauges, while S&B with 1.1U10 becomes more accurate \nat the deeper coastal tide gauges.  By using a wave-dependent Charnock parameter, \ni.e. using the stress predicted by WAM in POLCOMS, we aim to capture both the \ntemporal and spatial changes in the surface roughness due to the development of the \nwave field.  Mastenbroek et al. (1993) found implementing an untuned wave-\ndependent drag coefficient led to over-prediction of the peak surges, but here the finer \nmodel resolution (an order of magnitude finer spatially) gave realistic surge prediction \n(black solid line in Fig.16).  In this investigation the peak (residual) surge prediction \nis most important as it represents the effect of the wind-stress on the surge, we \ntherefore want the best PEF-residual and peak bias (Table 1, Fig. 16).  We also \nrequire a good surge prediction at all states of the tide, hence a good regional TEF \n(Table 1, Fig. 16).       \n \nWe found that a better regional TEF, PEF-skew and peak bias was achieved using \u03b1 = \n0.0275 (with and without waves) or S&B with U25, than using \u03b1 = 0.0144 (with and \nwithout waves) or S&B with U10.  But the opposite was true for the PEF-residual.  \nThis demonstrates that the choice of (constant) \u03b1 applied in a surge model, will \ndepend upon which aspect of the surge is most important to the model application.  \nUsing a wave-dependent Charnock parameter (WD) gave the best regional PEF-\nresidual and bias in the main peak, and an intermediate regional TEF and PEF-skew \ncompared to the constant \u03b1 values (Table 1).  Using a wave-dependent \u03b1 therefore \nprovides the most accurate prediction of the surge peaks across the region, although \u03b1 \n= 0.0275 (with and without waves) provides the best regional skew surge prediction \nand general surge trend over time.      \n \nFig. 16 shows that the wave-dependent (residual) surge prediction is of similar value \nto that of \u03b1 = 0.0275 (S&B with 1.1U10) as the surge elevation increases.  After the \nsurge peak the wave-dependent (residual) surge prediction then tends towards \u03b1 = \n0.0144 (S&B with U10).  This shift in bias between the constant \u03b1 values is location \ndependent, giving the best regional peak surge prediction.  The time variation of the \nwave-dependent \u03b1 value produced more accurate peaks in the surge than using \nconstant \u03b1 over the region (Table 1). \n \nRunning the fully coupled wave-current model with and without external wave \nboundary conditions (to the Irish Sea) (Fig. 16) demonstrated that the influence of the \nmore developed waves does have a small impact on the surge prediction (in the more \nexposed places).  The only changes occur during the peaks in surge. Initially (for the \nfirst two surge peaks) the effect of the external waves is to increase the surge \nelevation and then for the final peak to decrease the surge elevation.  This is due to the \nexternal waves becoming more fully-developed (swell) with time leading to reduced \nsurface roughness.  The inclusion of external waves causes the regional measures of \naccuracy to become worse (Table 1).  The larger regional bias is due to an increased \nnegative bias at Liverpool and Workington being averaged with a reduced positive \nbias at Douglas, Hilbre and Heysham.  Locally, the inclusion of external wave \nconditions improves the peak bias at many of the locations (Fig. 16).  External waves \npropagating into the Irish Sea from the Atlantic through the North Channel and the \nCeltic Sea have negligible impact on the surge prediction in the eastern Irish Sea.  \nHence, it is more computationally efficient to only nest the hydrodynamic model for \nthis area.  This is due to the shallow (< 40m) depths in the Irish Sea and the sheltering \neffects from Anglesey and the narrow North Channel preventing external swell \npropagating into the study area.  Within the eastern Irish Sea locally generated wind \nwaves are of most importance and due to the limited fetch these are often young \nwaves that produce increased surface stresses.  These results imply that the short fetch \nin the eastern Irish Sea is enough for wave-age to influence the surge prediction.      \n \n3.2.1. The 1977 tidal simulation \nThe POLCOMS tidal prediction for the 1977 surge event was compared to the \nastronomical tide at the five coastal tide gauges investigated.  We found that \nPOLCOMS consistently over-predicted high water by 1\u22127% and under-predicted low \nwater by 5\u201312%.  This over-predicted tidal range is why the larger \u03b1 (0.0275) \nimproved the TEF and skew surge results.  The greater depth at high water reduced \nthe wind influence on the surge, while this \u03b1 enhanced the stress.  Thus the surge at \nhigher water elevations (the troughs in the residual surge), and hence the skew surge, \nwere more accurately predicted.  The peak residual surge, however, was not.  The \nlower water depth increased the wind influence, which when combined with an \nincreased stress due a large \u03b1 caused an over-prediction of the peak residual surge. \nSince the peak values in residual surge have minimal effect on the RMS error, \u03b1 = \n0.0275 therefore improves the TEF accuracy.  The large tidal range during the 1977 \nevent means that tuning the Charnock parameter to improve the peak (residual) surge \ncaused the skew surge prediction to become worse and visa versa.  Thus a better tidal \nprediction would be desirable to more accurately tune the constant \u03b1.   \n \n3.3. Validation using January 2007 \nThe January 2007 surge event was simulated using a subset of the Charnock methods \napplied to the November 1977 event.  These runs, with better winds, verify that the \nmethods used are the most appropriate for accurate surge prediction, and also allow \nassessment of the wave modelling during this more recent storm event, since wave \ndata have been recorded since 2002.  The results have been obtained for the seven \navailable coastal tide gauges in the eastern Irish Sea, but only analysed at five coastal \ntide gauges around the eastern Irish Sea consistent with those used in the 1977 event.   \n \n3.3.1. Effect of model resolution \nAcross the region a comparison of the (residual) surge prediction made by the \noperational surge model (CS3X) and POLCOMS, with the same set up as the \noperational surge model (no waves, \u03b1 = 0.0275 and tide-surge boundary conditions \nfrom CS3X), has been made.  Fig. 17 demonstrates that the POLCOMS model with \nhigher spatial resolution can better capture the trends in the surge within the eastern \nIrish Sea.  Both models have the lowest accuracy at Llandudno and Holyhead.  This \nmay be due to local wind and sheltering effects.  Since POLCOMS does not resolve \nHolyhead harbour and Llandudno is a secondary port we omit these tide gauges and \nconcentrate on the five coastal tide gauges in the eastern Irish Sea to validate the \nmodel.  At the Irish Sea model boundary, we found that the operational surge model \nunder-predicted the mean surge level by 8% at the southern boundary (Ilfracombe) \nand over-predicted it by 23% in through the North Channel (Port Rush).  This over-\nprediction may also be the reason for the over-predicted surge conditions at \nLlandudno and Holyhead.  With distance from the North Channel the POLCOMS \npredictions improve, demonstrating that even when a surge propagates from the south \nwest the surge through the North Channel may have significant impact in the eastern \nIrish Sea.   \n \n3.3.2. Surge results \nThe tuned model settings for the 1977 event were applied to the 2007 event.  The \nregionally averaged measures of model accuracy are given in Table 2.  Table 2 gives \nthe five tide gauge average values, for Hilbre, Heysham, Liverpool, Port Erin and \nWorkington.  This provides a consistent region (Liverpool Bay area of the eastern \nIrish Sea) for comparison with the 1977 surge event and also reduces errors in the \nsurge prediction resulting from the boundary conditions.   \n \nAgain we found that wave effects on the bottom friction had a negligible impact on \nthe simulations with constant \u03b1. Also, the constant parameter settings (0.0144 and \n0.0275) provided fairly accurate surge predictions (Fig. 18).  For this event both \nconstant Charnock parameters performed equally well at capturing the peak (residual) \nsurge at Heysham, while \u03b1 = 0.0275 was better at Hilbre compared with \u03b1 = 0.0144 at \nthese two locations in the 1977 event.  At Workington and Port Erin \u03b1 = 0.0144 was \nbetter for this surge event unlike the 1977 event when \u03b1 = 0.0275 was better at \nWorkington and Douglas.  At Liverpool \u03b1 = 0.0275 remained the better option.  \nCompared to the 1977 event the best constant \u03b1 for the TEF and the PEF-residual has \nreversed.  This time including wave effects in the surface stress only improved the \nPEF-residual, while the other three metrics became worse.  This model therefore still \nprovides the best prediction of the peaks in the surge in Liverpool Bay (Liverpool and \nHilbre) and is very similar to \u03b1 = 0.0275 through time.  \n \nThe phase and magnitude of the peak surge are accurately modelled at Heysham, \nHilbre and Liverpool.  At Port Erin and Workington the peak is overestimated and \nlags that measured at the tide gauges.  This is most likely attributable to errors in the \nwind forcing.  Comparison of the mesoscale wind data (used to drive the model) and \ndata collected every 10minutes from the Hilbre met station illustrated that a slight \n(1.75hr) phase lag and increase in magnitude (by 7%) occurred at this location.  The \nphase error in the wind forcing may also explain why the modelled surge event \npersists for longer duration than suggested in the data at all tide gauge locations.         \n \n3.3.3. Tidal simulation in 2007 \nAgain the tidal range is over-predicted by POLCOMS, but the range is not as large as \nduring the 1977 event.  Hence the influence of the inaccuracy in the tide is not as \ngreat and the effects of a large \u03b1 (0.0275) makes the general surge prediction worse, \nexcept at high water.  The tidal range also seems to affect the choice of constant \nCharnock parameter at a location, to capture the peak residual surge.  The deeper low \nwater levels during the 2007 event compared to the 1977 event means the lower \nCharnock parameter is now favoured in shallow locations.  The tide-surge interaction \nis also less significant in 2007, especially at the deeper coastal tide gauges.  The effect \nof the under-predicted low water depth therefore has less effect and the lower \nCharnock value now gives a better peak (residual) surge prediction.  The smaller \n(compared to 1977) tidal range during the 2007 event reduced the tide-surge \ninteraction, thus tuning the Charnock parameter to improve the peak (residual) surge \nalso improved the skew surge prediction.     \n \n3.4. Wind-stress predictions \nThe wind-stress predicted by POLCOMS is illustrated in Fig. 19 for the 1977 event \nand Fig. 20 for the 2007 event.  During the 1977 surge there are three distinct peaks in \nthe wind-stress.  These peaks do not coincide with the times of peak surge, the 2nd and \n3rd peak are also quite close to the times of high water.  This implies that tide-surge \ninteraction is considerable as a result of the large tidal range during the 1977 surge, \nthus causing significant tidal modulation in the residual surge, as already discussed. \n \nIn 2007 there was a single dominant peak in the wind stress which occurred close to \nhigh water, except at Liverpool and Hilbre.  At these two locations the peak in the \nwind-stress occurs later (close to low water).  Tide-surge interaction can explain the \nenhanced second peak and tidal modulation at these two locations.  Heysham also has \nconsiderable tide-surge modulation, which can be explained by the more symmetrical \nshape in the wind-stress peak (Fig. 20).  At the time of low water the stress still has a \nrelatively significant impact.  At Port Erin and Workington no tide-surge modulation \nis seen as a result of the asymmetric peak in the wind-stress.  The stress gradually \nincreases and rapidly decreases, so its influence at low tide is relatively less \nsignificant than at high tide, which also explains why the residual surge peak is lower.  \nDuring this surge event the tidal range is less than that during the 1977 event, so any \ntidal modulation of the surge is much weaker than in November 1977.  A further point \nof interest is the effect of waves on the timing of the peak stress at Hilbre.  \n \nWe have found that during a surge event it depends on the location (effect of water \ndepth) and the waves during the event as to whether the peak stress is enhanced by \nwaves (WD) or remains comparable to using a constant (0.0144) Charnock parameter.  \nAt the wave buoy location the wave-age drops from 18 just before the surge to 4 at \nthe peak of the surge in January 2007, before increasing to 12 as the winds drop.  \nAcross the eastern Irish Sea there is also noticeable variation in wave-age at the peak \nof a surge event.  The shoaling waves in Liverpool Bay (Heysham, Hilbre and \nLiverpool area) are younger (cp\/u*~5) than elsewhere in the eastern Irish Sea \n(cp\/u*~10).  The Isle of Man has a sheltering effect from the wind resulting in old \nwaves along its leeward side (cp\/u*~15).  Older waves (cp\/u*~11\u221213) due to the \nsheltering effects of the North Channel also occur to windward of the Isle of Man.  \nWe have shown that the Charnock relation already captures a significant amount of \nthe sea state variation (as did Wu, 1982) across the eastern Irish Sea, since accurate \nsurge prediction is achieved at five different locations.  But to improve the peaks in \nsurge prediction wave-dependence may be included in the calculation of the Charnock \nparameter.  \n \n4. Discussion \nThe model was tested with different wind stress using the S&B (uncoupled) and the \nCharnock (coupled and uncoupled) formulations.  The model set up was calibrated \nusing the November 1977 surge event and then validated using an extreme event in \nJanuary 2007, for which good high resolution wind data, surge model boundary \nconditions, coastal tide gauge data and wave data are available. \n \nIn the 1977 event the model simulation at Liverpool is out of phase with the data.  \nSince the surge between Hilbre and Liverpool is similar in 2007 it is suspected that \ntiming errors in the Liverpool tide gauge occurred during the 1977 event. However, \nlocal wind effects could be important in one event but not the other.  The main surge \npeak just after the 12th November is greatly under-predicted.  It is thought the errors in \nphase and magnitude are related to the wind resolution in 1977 missing local effects \nwithin the estuary, rather than model resolution, since the 2007 surge is much more \naccurately predicted.  At Douglas and Hilbre there is a secondary peak in the surge on \nthe 12th November 1977, which is missed by the model.  Due to the narrow time \nframe in which this peak occurs (1.95hours) and wind data being provided every 3 \nhours the model does not capture this brief event as a result of interpolation \nsmoothing the wind field.  This highlights the need for high resolution met data to \nprevent smoothing of the surge events and maintain the peaks in the signal.  The loss \nof this spike may have influenced the under-prediction of the second peak at \nLiverpool Bay. \n \nWe have also demonstrated that it is important to accurately simulate the tidal range, \nsince tide-surge interaction can be important within Liverpool Bay. In the November \n1977 significant tidal modulation occurred in the surge, while in January 2007 the \nmodulation was less important.  This demonstrates that the tidal range is important in \ncontrolling the extent of the surge-tide interaction.  At Douglas during the 10th \u2212 11th \nNovember 1977 the tidal variation in the tide gauge data is lost.  It is thought that this \nmay be due to errors in the methods used to process the data and that the model is \naccurate in simulating tidal modulation during this period.    \n \nWetting and drying of inter-tidal zones has not been included within this model \nsimulation, but would be advantageous.  To prevent numerical instability during low \ntidal levels in shallow water a minimum depth must be set.  This research highlighted \nthe need for the minimum water depth to be as low as possible to accurately simulate \nsurge events in shallow locations, in this case 5m (however coastal tide gauges are \ngenerally in a minimum of 5m water depth).  This is due to the finite difference \ndiscretisation of the sea area in POLCOMS, as the surface elevation gradient is \nbalanced by the wind-stress divided by depth and hence the effect of wind-stress is \nmuch stronger in shallower water.  Therefore the bathymetry in shallow regions must \nbe as accurate as possible.  By comparing the surge prediction of POLCOMS to that \nof CS3X we also show grid resolution is important in surge prediction.  \n \nS&B was initially developed for low (< 21m\/s) wind conditions, but relations with a \nsimilar form to S&B have proven to work well for strong (up to 60m\/s) wind \nconditions, even though changes in sea state are not explicitly considered in this \nmethod (Wu, 1982).  When using S&B for the November 1977 surge we found it \nnecessary to increase the 10m wind velocity by a factor of 1.1 at deeper locations to \nget the correct surge (as found in Williams and Flather, 2000, for the UK operational \nsurge model), although in shallower areas the original S&B formulation worked well \nfor this case. Again this is somewhat an artefact of the finite difference discretisation \ncausing a bias in the wind-stress to be much more important in shallower water.  For \nthe January 2007 event the opposite occurred: a higher Charnock value and therefore \nU25 worked better in shallow water.  This may be related to the smaller tidal range \nduring this event.  The deeper low water levels reduce the depth integrated stress \neffect compared to the 1977 event and thus require an enhanced stress to capture the \nsurge.  For coarse grids such as CS3X and the Atlantic Margin POLCOMS model the \naverage depth within a grid cell near the coast will be greater that that of the fine \nresolution Irish Sea POLCOMS model.  This is why the wind requires scaling in the \ncoarse models for S&B to work well.  The fact that POLCOMS used S&B with low \nresolution U10 data and no scaling, led to the under-prediction of the boundary \nconditions to force the external surge in November 1977.  It was therefore necessary \nto modify the prediction by a linear regression to obtain water levels similar to those \nmeasured close to the boundary.  Since the CS3X model, with a tuned Charnock \nparameter that used high resolution U10 data, was available for the January 2007 surge \nan accurate external boundary forcing was provided without the need to adjust the \nboundary conditions.   \n \nInterestingly, it was found that with regard to predicting the peak (residual) surge \u03b1 = \n0.0144 (\u2261 S&B with U10) was better in shallow water and \u03b1 = 0.0275 (\u2261 S&B with \nU25) was better in deeper water for the November 1977 surge and visa versa for the \nJanuary 2007 surge.  For the bias in skew surge the opposite was true in the 1977 \ncase, but not for the 2007 case.  This demonstrates how time variation in the tidal \nelevation is important and can affect the tuning of the Charnock parameter, depending \non whether the user requires accurate surge prediction at lower water levels (peak \nresidual surge) or higher water levels (skew surge).  By using the wave-dependent \nCharnock parameter we have accurately simulated the surge at most states of the tide.  \nIn the eastern Irish Sea \u03b1 took a maximum value of 0.07 (Fig. 13). These extreme \nvalues are a result of shoaling in Liverpool Bay and fetch-limited conditions along the \neast coast of Ireland, although the latter is questionable (Taylor and Yelland, 2001). \n \nThe PEF-residual has been chosen as the most important accuracy measure to tune \nthe model set up, since this parameter measures the accuracy of the surge during low \nwater levels when the wind-stress has most influence.  A constant Charnock \nparameter can be tuned to obtain the best value for a given accuracy measure (Table 1 \nand 2), but the constant value which is most accurate for each measure varies from \nsurge to surge.  For example \u03b1 = 0.0275 performs best for the PEF-residual in 2007, \nwhile \u03b1 = 0.0144 is better in 1977.  On average, for these two south-westerly\/westerly \nsurge events, \u03b1 = 0.0275 is always the most accurate constant value for the metrics \nconsidered (Table 3) and most importantly gives the best PEF-residual.  The wave-\ndependent Charnock parameter improves the PEF-residual and gives a similar level of \naccuracy for the peak bias.  Hence this model set up is more accurate than applying a \nsingle constant Charnock value to different surges over a long time period (Table 3).  \nWe have shown that the Charnock value should vary, depending on sea state, from \nvalues below 0.0144 to above 0.0275 during a surge event (Figs. 16 and 18 and Figs. \n19 and 20).  Wu (1982) demonstrated that an intermediate Charnock constant of \n0.0185 accurately predicted surface stress for all sea states.  Table 3 shows that \u03b1 = \n0.0185 provides an intermediate overall accuracy than using \u03b1 = 0.0144 or \u03b1 = 0.0275.  \nIt must be noted that the results presented here could be biased to shallow locations \nsince three out of the five coastal tide gauges were considered shallow and also to \nsouth-westerly\/westerly surge event.  But since the constant Charnock value that \nperforms best at a shallow location is often opposite to that which performs best at a \ndeep location, we seek a Charnock value that will perform well across an entire \ndomain.  We have achieved an intermediate surge prediction compared to using the \ntwo constant Charnock parameters by using \u03b1 = 0.0185.  But the most accurate \nrepresentation of the peaks in surge was obtained by using the wave-dependent \nCharnock-like parameter from the wave model, where \u03b1 > 0.01 and typically \u03b1 \u2265 \n0.0185.  For different surge events we have shown contrary to the findings of \nMastenbroek et al. (1993) that there is no single constant Charnock parameter that \ncaptures the behaviour of the wave-dependent parameter.  Also, a lower (0.0275) \nvalue was found to give better surge prediction than that (0.032) found by \nMastenbroek et al. (1993).  This could be related to the finer grid resolution applied in \nthe Irish Sea. \n \nWe have shown that a surge can be accurately predicted across the Irish Sea by tuning \na constant Charnock parameter, without the need for including waves.  This allows \nquick efficient computations to be performed.  In both shallow and deep water the \neffect of waves through bottom friction had negligible impact on the surge prediction.  \nWe have demonstrated that for a specific location in Liverpool Bay S&B can give as \ngood a prediction as Charnock with a constant parameter, when they are both scaled \nfor that location and surge event.  Although the eastern Irish Sea is dominated by \nyoung wind-seas during a surge event, there is variation in the wave-age across the \nregion and during the surge event itself.  In extreme storm conditions in the eastern \nIrish Sea the young waves cause a large surface roughness.  This resulting surface \nstress is therefore greater than that predicted by S&B which is only weakly dependent \non sea state through U10.  For more accurate global surge prediction, using a wave-\ndependent Charnock parameter removes the need for finding an optimum constant \nCharnock parameter, which will be dependent on the location, surge event and model \ngrid resolution.  The use of look-up tables and iterative methods could be \nimplemented into a stand-alone model to include wave-age dependence, without the \nneed for model coupling, to keep computation time down.      \n \n5. Conclusions \nThe eastern Irish Sea provides simple wave-surge conditions.  A consistent method to \ncalculate the surface stress in the wave and surge models has been implemented.  We \nhave shown that a constant Charnock parameter can be tuned to give good surge \nresults, but not necessarily optimum over time and space. A relatively large Charnock \nvalue (e.g. compared to Wu, 1982) was required.  Using a wave-related surface stress \ngave variation in the Charnock parameter with a physical basis.  However, \ncontroversy still exists over the \u2018wave-age\u2019 dependence of the surface drag \ncoefficient.   \n \nThe simulations of two extreme surge events in Liverpool Bay have shown that the \nexternal swell from the North Atlantic has negligible effect on the wave and surge \nprediction.  In contrast the external surge from the North Atlantic dominates the local \nsurge.  We have found S&B gives good predictions for high resolution models and \nshallow areas.  When using a coarse model grid, or investigating surge events in \ndeeper water, the wind velocity requires scaling (to represent U25 ~1.1U10).  The S&B \nmethod can be represented by a Charnock relation with a (tuned) constant parameter.  \nThis provides a consistent method to represent the surface stress in both the wave and \nhydrodynamic model which facilitates coupling of the models.  Taking wave effects \ninto account has little impact on surge prediction unless the surface stress term is also \ncoupled within the model.  Applying a wave-dependent Charnock-like parameter \nprovides spatial and temporal variation in the surface stress relation.  This allows peak \nsurge conditions due to different surge events to be more accurately modelled across a \nregion.  \n \nWe have tried to resolve the question of whether surge model accuracy is improved \nby including a wave-dependent surface stress.  This should only occur if there are \nsignificant wave-age changes across a region, in which case a constant Charnock \nparameter will not suffice.  The modelling results suggest that at the time of peak \nsurge the waves are still considered very \u2018young\u2019 in the Irish Sea.  Conditions in the \neastern Irish Sea (with short fetch and shallow depths) prevent \u2018old\u2019 waves occurring.  \nAlthough the Charnock relation was not developed for shallow, enclosed coastal \nbasins it seems to hold for such conditions, as does the Charnock-like procedure in \nWAM.  Wave-steepness and not wave-age relations have been found to perform \nbetter in shallow (and shoaling), fetch-limited conditions (Drennan, et al., 2005), but \nwe find that using \u03c4w\/\u03c4 to represent wave-age effects well predicts surges in Liverpool \nBay.  Due to the sequence of computation in WAM the wave-dependent \u03b1 is \nprevented from achieving its unrealistic upper limit at peak surge.  During a surge \nevent the wave-dependent \u03b1 increases from 0.0185 to a maximum of 0.07 in \nLiverpool Bay, a result of very young shoaling waves.  During a surge event local \nwaves therefore give a significant enhancement of the surface roughness.  We have \nshown that surge events in this region are susceptible to turning winds (younger wind \nsea modifying the surface roughness at peak surge), although they require steady wind \nfor a considerable time period to build the surge set up.  Scaling of ze was not required \nin the surge module to produce the appropriate stress for storm surges, the full wave-\nage dependent stress from the wave module (Janssen, 1991) was retained.  If the \nwave-dependence of the Charnock parameter is to be ignored then \u03b1 = 0.0275 \nprovides a good parameterisation (on average) of the wind-stress over long time \nperiods in the eastern Irish Sea.  Further investigation for the whole shelf is desirable \nto see how representative this method is.   \n \nAcknowledgements  \nThis work was carried out as part of the NERC FREE CoFEE project, with the help \nand advice of Eric Jones regarding the 1977 surge event.
