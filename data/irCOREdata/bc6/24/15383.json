It is also a key concept in geography, but it has not been subject to as \nmuch critical attention as related geographical terms and remains under-theorised. \nTaking my cue from Timothy Mitchell\u2019s suggestion that the state should be \nunderstood as the effect of social practices, I argue that the phenomenon that we call \nterritory is not an irreducible foundation of state power, let alone the expression of a \nbiological imperative. Instead, territory too must be interpreted principally as an \neffect. This \u201aterritory-effect\u201b can best be understood as the outcome of networked \nsocio-technical practices. Thus far from refuting or falsifying network theories of \nspatiality, the current resurgence of territory can be seen as itself a product of \nrelational networks. Drawing on an empirical case study of the monitoring of \nregional economic performance through the measurement of Gross Value Added \n(GVA), I show that \u201aterritory\u201b and \u201anetwork\u201b are not, as is often assumed, \nincommensurable and rival principles of spatial organisation, but are intimately \nconnected. \n \nKeywords \n \nstate spatiality; territory; territory-effect; network; region; value added \n \nIntroduction \n \n2 \n \nTerritory is back. For long something of a poor relation among spatial concepts, and \nuntil recently on the wane politically, territory today seems to be ever more \nimportant. Borders, security, sovereignty, secession, invasion and occupation \u2013 all \nusually seen as close correlates of territory \u2013 are rarely out of the news. Meanwhile, \nin political theory and philosophy, the fashionable notion of deterritorialisation \ncannot be separated from a correlative reterritorialisation. Territory\u2019s time has come, \nor so it seems. \n \nIf any kind of space is quintessentially \u201astate space\u201b, it is surely \u201aterritory\u201b. Yet, for \nall the far-reaching discussion of the territorial reorganisation of the contemporary \nstate, the decline and rise of the political salience of territory, and the implications of \nterritory for the exercise of power, the nature of territory itself \u2013 its being and \nbecoming, rather than its consequences and effects \u2013 remains under-theorised and \ntoo often taken for granted. The intense engagement with diverse forms of social \ntheory that has marked human geography since the 1980s has involved a \ncomprehensive interrogation and re-thinking of many of the core concepts of the \ndiscipline, including space, place, landscape, region and scale. Until recently, \nhowever, the concept of territory has not received the same level of attention, at least \nin the Anglophone literature. \n \nIt is interesting to think about the reasons for this relative neglect. It seems plausible \nto suggest that among critical human geographers the concept of territory may even \nhave been seen as something of an embarrassment. There is a couple of possible \nexplanations for this, particularly if  we accept for the sake of argument that territory \nhas usually been understood as a bounded and in some respects homogeneous portion \nof geographical space. Geographical thinking in the 1980s and 1990s came \nincreasingly to emphasise the porosity and fluidity of boundaries, and the \nsupposedly consequent reduction in their political salience. It also stressed the \n3 \n \nincreasingly (or even intrinsically) heterogeneous character of space and place. In \nthese circumstances, invoking the concept of territory risked being seen as either \nanachronistic (because the world had changed) or reactionary (because an insistence \non seeing the world in terms of bounded and homogenous spaces suggested a fear of \nOtherness and an exclusionary attitude to social and cultural difference). \n \nThe concept of territory may also have been embarrassing for some because of its ill-\ndefined, but powerful associations with the use of similar concepts in animal \nethology and socio-biology. After all, one of the commonest uses of the term \n\u201aterritory\u201b in general discourse is to refer to the home range of a animal, particularly \nwith reference to aggressive and defensive behaviours. Of course, anything that risks \nsmuggling socio-biological assumptions into studies of human activity is anathema \nto most critical social scientists. A similar mistrust of ideas smacking of \nenvironmental determinism may have added to the suspicion with which the \nconcept of territory has sometimes been regarded. Although many discussions of \nterritory suggest that it is fundamentally a political phenomenon, the perception that \nit also often involves fixed borders perhaps raised the spectre of \u201anatural \nboundaries\u201b and nineteenth century understandings about the relationship between \nculture and environment: desert peoples, mountain peoples, forest peoples and \nplains peoples; each with a special ineffable bond between culture, nature and \n\u201aterritory\u201b. \n \nThe resurgence of territory \n \nThe relative neglect of the concept of territory within geography has begun to \nchange. It is not hard to find reasons for this. Claims that the world was becoming \nborderless were always overstated, but in the years since 9\/11 borders have become \nmuch more important and more visible. At Heathrow Airport\u2019s new Terminal 5 \n4 \n \nhuge signs over passport control announce \u201aUK Border\u201b. Disputes over territory and \nsovereignty are also fiercer as ever. In the summer of 2008 the conflict between \nRussia and Georgia over the disputed regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia \nerupted into lethal violence. The Israeli occupation of Palestinian land continues. The \nwar in Iraq has brought the issue of sovereignty to the fore. In such circumstances \nthe abolition of border controls at many international frontiers inside the European \nUnion looks more like an exercise in European exceptionalism than the harbinger of \nthe cosmopolitan world to which the EU\u2019s supporters might once have aspired. And \nanyway, territorial politics is evident in many places inside the EU in Catalonia, \nIreland, Belgium and elsewhere. \n \nThe recent revival in the apparent political significance of territory poses obvious \nchallenges to the \u201aborderless world\u201b thesis of writers such as Kenichi Ohmae (1990) \nand to claims that we are seeing \u201athe end of sovereignty\u201b (Camilleri and Falk, 1992), \nthough it is worth noting that writers on socio-spatial theory have often provided \nmore nuanced accounts. For example, a reduction in the powers of nation-states \ndoes not necessarily mean the end of territory, as the extensive literature on the \nrestructuring and rescaling of state power and political authority amply \ndemonstrated (eg Brenner, 2004, Brenner et al., 2003, Jones and MacLeod, 1999, \nSwyngedouw, 2004). In a rather different vein, the \u201anew economic geography\u201b \n(which, as Ron Martin (1999) shows, took rather different forms in the two \ndisciplines of economics and geography) argued for the continuing \u2013 or even \nincreased \u2013 salience of place, locality and region in promoting economic \ndevelopment, innovation and \u201acompetitiveness\u201b. \n \nThe resurgence of territory also appears to call into question the current popularity \nof network approaches to socio-spatial theory \u2013 from Manuel Castells\u2019 diagnosis of \nthe emergence of the network society based on spaces of flows (Castells, 1996), to \n5 \n \ngeography\u2019s recent emphasis on relational thinking (eg Massey, 2004) and its lively \nengagements with the actor-network theory (eg Bingham and Thrift, 1999). Doubts \nabout networks are certainly widespread outside academia, where the assumption \nthat human beings are innately and immutably territorial is widely held. Defensive \nnationalisms are presented as \u201anatural\u201b and predictable expressions of ethnic \ndifference. A government minister in a supposedly centre-left administration \nendorses gated communities (The Guardian, 2004). Journalists are quick to diagnose \nregions as suffering from \u201aBalkanisation\u201b, with all that term\u2019s connotations of an \nirredeemably tribal human nature lurking beneath a thin covering of civilisation. \nRespected voices in the European Union, a supposed bastion of tolerance and \ncosmopolitanism, argue against the admission of Turkey because of its unbridgeable \nOtherness (The Independent, 2002). More progressively, a territorial view of the world \narguably valorises minority languages and cultures, distinctive gastronomies and \nartistic and musical practices, and a nurturing and ecologically-sensitive approach to \nthe land and its products. \n \nNetworks, on the other hand, have become widely linked to risk and danger in the \npublic imagination. IT networks transmit computer viruses and child pornography \nand enable financial fraud on a grand scale. Airlines spread diseases such as SARS \nand swine flu, transport illegal immigrants, and help to destroy the environment \nthrough climate change. Terrorists, people traffickers and drug smugglers are \norganised in networks. So too (and almost as threatening to middle America and \nmiddle England) are eco-warriors and anti-capitalist activists. Global financial \nnetworks have resulted in such a complex web of interconnections that a credit crisis \nin one jurisdiction is rapidly transmitted to many others leading to the failure and \nstate bailout of major financial institutions. Despite much evidence for the nomadic \norigins of the human species, nomadism today is frequently seen as unnatural and \n6 \n \nnomadic people from European Roma to Aboriginal Australians and the San people \nof the Kalahari suffer discrimination, oppression, mistrust and dispossession. \n \nThese sketches of the popular politics of territories and networks are over-simplified, \nof course. Opposing views and voices that take a more positive view of networks \nand offer a more sceptical approach to territory are present in all kinds of public and \nprivate discourse, including in popular journalism and the speeches of populist \npoliticians. Nevertheless, the general tendency today is, I think, to affirm a territorial \nview of the world as an expression of human nature and (therefore) right, while \nseeing in networks a source of anxiety, instability, risk and unwelcome change. \n \nWhatever their rights and wrongs, the implicit assumption of almost all these \ndiscourses \u2013 academic, public and popular \u2013 is that territory and network are \nincommensurable and competing forms of spatial organisation, and that territory-\nthinking and network-thinking are mutually incompatible. In this paper I aim to \nshow that this assumption is mistaken and that territory can best be understood as \nthe effect of networked relations. The central argument is as follows. The \nphenomenon that we call territory is not an irreducible foundation of state power, let \nalone the expression of a biological imperative. It is not a transhistorical feature of \nhuman affairs and should not be invoked as an explanatory principle that itself \nneeds no explanation: territory is not some kind of spatio-political first cause. \nInstead, territory must be interpreted principally as an effect: as explanandum more \nthan explanans. Adapting Bruno Latour, like other enduring and seemingly solid \nfeatures of our world this effect can best be understood as the outcome of networked \nsocio-technical practices. Moreover, far from refuting or falsifying network theories \nof spatiality, the contemporary resurgence of territory can be seen as itself a product \nof relational networks. Thus \u201aterritory\u201b and \u201anetwork\u201b are not, as is often assumed, \nincommensurable and rival principles of spatial organisation, but are intimately \n7 \n \nconnected. However, these connections need to be identified quite precisely. It is \nimportant, not to invoke a generalised \u201areciprocity\u201b, \u201ainteraction\u201b or  \u201adialectic\u201b \nbetween territory and network that leaves the taken-for-granted notion of territory \nintact and simply adds networks on. If we take the networked constitution of the \nterritory-effect seriously, then conventional ideas of territory will need to be \nreconceptualised. This in turn might enable us to think somewhat differently about \nthe significance and consequences of territory\u2014about the effects of the effect, as it \nwere. For example, from this viewpoint territory is necessarily porous, historical, \nmutable, uneven and perishable. It is a laborious work in progress, prone to failure \nand permeated by tension and contradiction. Territory is never complete, but always \nbecoming. It is also a promise the state cannot fulfil. \n \nTerritory and state spatiality \n \nThe concept of territory has been intimately associated with the spatiality of the state \nfor at least five hundred years. In political theory, many influential definitions of the \nstate have invoked territory as an essential element. Max Weber\u2019s is perhaps the best \nknown: \n \n[The state] possesses an administrative and legal order subject to change by \nlegislation, to which the organized activities of the administrative staff, which \nare also controlled by regulations, are oriented. This system of order claims \nbinding authority, not only over the members of the state, the citizens, most of \nwhom have obtained membership by birth, but also to a very large extent over \nall action taking place in the area of its jurisdiction. It is thus a compulsory \norganization with a territorial basis. Furthermore, today, the use of force is \nregarded as legitimate only so far as it is either permitted by the state or \nprescribed by it. *\u2026+ The claim of the modern state to monopolize the use of \n8 \n \nforce is as essential to it as its character of compulsory jurisdiction and of \ncontinuous operation. (Weber, 1968: 56, emphasis added) \n \nFor Michael Mann it is the centralised territoriality of the state that explains state \npower (Mann, 1984). For Antony Giddens modern states are distinguished from \ntheir predecessors by their association with sharply bounded territories across which \nthey exercise power uniformly (Giddens, 1985). The modern doctrine of state \nsovereignty in international law is predicated on the concept of territory. Similarly \nthe term \u201ajurisdiction\u201b can refer both to the exercise of legal authority and to the \nterritory over which such power extends. In English, the word \u201acountry\u201b can be \nused as a synonym for both \u201astate\u201b and \u201aterritory\u201b. \n \nThe notion of territory at work in these formulations involves a number of \nassumptions. Territories are in principle demarcated by clear boundaries rather than \namorphous frontiers. Territories do not overlap. The spatial extent of state \nsovereignty is coterminous with territory. State power is exercised uniformly across \nterritory, and the boundary marks a radical rupture in the nature and intensity of \npower. Such assumptions underpin many of the official doctrines of international \nrelations as they have been generally understood by state elites and frequently \nenshrined in international law. These include \u201arights\u201b to self-determination, \nterritorial integrity, and non-interference (cf. Elden, 2005b); the distinction between \nforeign and domestic policy (cf. Campbell, 1992); control over terrestrial and marine \nresources; and authority over individuals and populations present within state \nboundaries. \n \nWhile government leaders and international jurists may insist that these conventions \nand doctrines are absolute, they are of course contested politically and frequently \nviolated in practice. They also involve significant conceptual difficulties. John \n9 \n \nAgnew coined the phrase \u201aterritorial trap\u201b (Agnew, 1994) to highlight the mistaken \nassumption that the spatialities of state power and state territory are homomorphic. \nIn addition, processes of state restructuring from the 1970s onwards generated more \ncomplex forms of territorial organisation. James Anderson (1996) suggested that in \nthe European Union, neo-medieval and postmodern forms of territoriality were \nemerging involving overlapping authority and shared sovereignty. Examples of \npartition, devolution and federalisation appeared to testify to the plastic nature of \nstate spatiality. \n \nThis growing awareness of the plasticity of state spatiality is related to the \nemergence of relational approaches to theorising the state more generally. Many \nauthors have questioned whether the state should be seen as an distinct entity or a \nunified social actor at all (for a review see Painter, 2005). In a notable critique of the \nrelentless reification of the state in mainstream social science, Timothy Mitchell \nargues that the state is not an organisation or structure separate from the rest of \nsociety, but must be understood as a structural effect, that is \u201ait should be examined \nnot as an actual structure, but as the powerful, metaphysical effect of practices that \nmake such structures appear to exist\u201b (Mitchell, 1991: 94). Mitchell\u2019s arguments form \nan important part of the inspiration for this paper. The suggestion that the state is \nbest conceptualised as the effect of practices can equally be applied to state spatiality \nand specifically to territory. Indeed Mitchell himself makes the point that territorial \nboundaries can be understood in exactly this way: \n \nOne characteristic of the modern state, for example, is the frontier. By \nestablishing a territorial boundary and exercising absolute control over \nmovement across it, state practices define and help constitute a national \nentity. Setting up and policing a frontier involves a variety of fairly modern \nsocial practices \u2013 continuous barbed-wire fencing, passports, immigration \n10 \n \nlaws, inspections, currency control and so on. These mundane arrangements, \nmost of them unknown two hundred or even one hundred years ago, help \nmanufacture an almost transcendental entity, the nation state. This entity \ncomes to seem something much more than the sum of the everyday activities \nthat constitute it, appearing as a structure containing and giving order and \nmeaning to people's lives. (Mitchell, 1991: 94) \n \nThe central thesis of this paper is that territory should be understood principally as \nan effect of just the kind of \u201asocial practices\u201b to which Mitchell refers, though in \naccordance with much current thinking in geography I prefer the term socio-\ntechnical practices. (In fact Mitchell\u2019s reference to barbed-wire fencing makes it clear \nthat the material and technical are interwoven with the social in the production of \nterritory.) \n \nThese practices are the products of networked relations involving both human and \nnon-human actors. The geographies of such networks differ in important respects \nfrom those of the territories (or more precisely the territory-effects) they generate. \nFor one, networks may extend very widely across space and time enrolling distant \npeople and things in the effectuation of territory. In addition the spatial structure of \na network may be web-like (multiple, cross-cutting linkages) or more linear (fewer \nrelations organised in series), but in either case it is quite different from that of \nterritory, which is usually understood to involve a bounded and continuous portion \nof space. \n \nIn the second half of the paper I will elaborate these arguments with the help of an \nempirical case study. First, though, I want to examine the treatment of the concept of \nterritory in human geography in a little more detail, drawing on both Anglophone \nand Francophone writing. The next section therefore considers two features of that \n11 \n \ntreatment: the way the concept of territory is commonly taken-for-granted and \nunexamined, and the over-extension of the term to refer to a remarkably wide range \nof phenomena. These features suggest there is scope for some re-thinking. Recent \nwork by Jacques L\u00e9vy and Michel Lussault points in a fruitful direction by \nintroducing conceptual precision and re-emphasising the irredeemably and actively \npolitical nature of territory. \n \nThe Concept of Territory in Human Geography \n \nA Taken-for-Granted Concept? \n \nThe current importance of conflicts over geographical space is reflected in a growing \nacademic literature on territory and territorial politics. There are now, for example, \ntextbooks on the subject (eg Delaney, 2005, Storey, 2001), and several writers have \ndealt with it as one of the key terms for the study of political geography (H\u00e4kli, 2001, \nNewman, 1999a, Newman, 1999b, Paasi, 1999, Paasi, 2003) and global politics (eg \nElden, 2008). Since John Agnew\u2019s path-breaking paper on the \u201aterritorial trap\u201b \n(Agnew, 1994) the geographical literature on territory has expanded considerably. \nNevertheless, there is scope for further reflection. Despite growing interest in the \npolitics of territory, and the consequences of a territorially ordered and reordered \nworld, the idea of territory remains under-theorised. According to Stuart Elden \n\u201aterritory tends to be assumed as unproblematic. Theorists have largely neglected to \ndefine the term, taking it as obvious and not worthy of further investigation\u201b (Elden, \n2005a: 10). While the implications of territory are hotly debated, the concept itself, its \ngenealogy, conceptual preconditions and even its precise meaning have been given \nless attention. In writings on the growing importance of territory it is common to \nfind either that the word is left undefined and its meaning simply assumed or that a \nsingle straightforward definition is offered without critique or further discussion. \n12 \n \nThis may not matter for the cogency of the argument of any particular piece of \nwriting, but taken together it signifies something of a collective disregard for the \nconceptualisation of this increasingly important idea. \n \nIn their introduction to an important collection of essays on War, Citizenship, \nTerritory, Deborah Cowen and Emily Gilbert introduce the concept of territory thus: \n \n\u201aTerritory\u201b is a term that is often used interchangeably with land or space, \nbut it connotes something more precise. Territory is land or space that has \nhad something done to it\u2014it has been acted upon. Territory is land that has \nbeen identified and claimed by a person or people. *\u2026+ It is a bounded space \nto which there is a compulsion to defend and secure\u2014to claim a particular \nkind of sovereignty\u2014against infringements by others who are perceived to \nnot belong. (Cowen and Gilbert, 2008: 16) \n \nThis formulation is a fairly typical, and comparable definitions abound. According to \nDavid Storey, \u201aterritory refers to a portion of geographic space which is claimed or \noccupied by a person or group of persons or by an institution. It is, thus, an area of \n\u201abounded space\u201b.\u201b (Storey, 2001: 1). For David Delaney, a territory is \u201aa bounded \nsocial space that inscribes a certain sort of meaning onto defined segments of the \nmaterial world\u201b (Delaney, 2005: 14). In the view of Kevin Cox, territory and \nterritoriality are \u201athe core concepts of political geography\u201b and \n \nterritory is to be understood through its relations to those activities we define \nas territorial: the exercise of territoriality, in other words *\u2026+ this means that \nin addition to territory having associations of area and boundary it also has \nones of defense: territories are spaces which people defend by excluding some \n13 \n \nactivities and by including those which will enhance more precisely what it is \nin the territory that they want to defend. (Cox, 2002: 2-3). \n \nAll these definitions are strikingly similar. In terms of rhetoric, they are assertions: \n\u201aterritory is A\u201b or \u201aterritory is B\u201b. Apart from the opening sentence of the Cowen \nand Gilbert quotation, the reader gets little sense that there may be divergent \nconcepts associated with the signifier \u201aterritory\u201b. To be fair, the texts from which \nthese quotations are taken contain much more extensive discussions of the \ncomplexities of territory. My point is that it is rare for such discussions to open with \nan explicit acknowledgement that the term is freighted with diverse and perhaps \ncompeting meanings. \n \nAn Over-Extended Concept? \n \nIn fact, diverse and competing meanings abound in the ways the word territory has \nbeen used in practice. According to Michel Lussault the concept has become wildly \nover-extended: \n \nNumerous social sciences (geography, of course, but also anthropology, \nsociology, economics and political science) seek to outdo each other in their \nuse of the notion of territory \u2013 and its variants,  such as the adjective \nterritorial, occasionally nominalised, and the noun territorialisation \u2013 most \noften without any real precise, explicit and stable definition. (Lussault, 2007: \n107) \n \nBob Jessop, Neil Brenner and Martin Jones label this tendency \u201amethodological \nterritorialism, which subsumes all aspects of socio-spatial relations under the rubric \nof territoriality\u201b (Jessop et al., 2008: 391). As Anssi Paasi puts it, \n14 \n \n \nseveral important dimensions of social life and social power come together in \nterritory: material elements such as land, functional elements like the control \nof space, and symbolic dimensions like social identity. At times the term is \nused more vaguely to refer at various spatial scales to portions of space that \ngeographers normally label as region, place or locality. (Paasi, 2003: 109) \n \nThe complexities and competing uses of the term have been unpacked by Jacques \nL\u00e9vy in his extended entry on territory [territoire] in the Belin Dictionnaire de la \nG\u00e9ographie (L\u00e9vy, 2003b). In fact it is notable that the Dictionnaire devotes 10 pages to \nterritoire, comprising entries by three different scholars \u2013 L\u00e9vy, Bernard Debarbieux \nand Jean-Paul Ferrier. Compare this with the 215 words on territory contributed by \nJohn Agnew to the 2000 edition of the Blackwell Dictionary of Human Geography. \nDepending on your point of view this difference in weight reflects either the greater \nsophistication or the greater confusion to be found in the Francophone literature and \ndebates on territory! (To be fair it should also be noted that the average length of \nentries in the French text is greater than those in the English dictionary.) \n \nL\u00e9vy\u2019s entry identifies eight \u201adefinitions\u201b or usages, as follows: \n \n1. During the spatial scientific [moderniste] phase of geography, territory was \nrejected in favour of space [espace+ because of the latter\u2019s more \u201amathematical\u201b \nconnotations and the assumption that the use of the term territory implied a \ncommitment to exceptionalism and the impossibility of comparison. \n2. A synonym for space [espace] \u2013 the converse of 1. Here territory is preferred \nprecisely because it is assumed to be more grounded in historical reality than \nthe more abstract \u201aspace\u201b. Levy notes that the two terms are sometimes used \ninterchangeably in the same text. \n15 \n \n3. A synonym for place [lieu]. A recent usage found in geography, but \npredominantly in political science and economics, where it has replaced \u201athe \nlocal\u201b and connotes a certain rootedness and identity that can function as \nresources for development. \u201aTerritorial\u201b is often used in economic geography \nto mean something like local as opposed to global. \n4. An epistemological move to distinguish the real from the concept. \u201aTerritory\u201b \nrefers to socialised space itself while \u201ageographical space\u201b [espace \ng\u00e9ographique] is the intellectual construction that allows it to be thought. \n5. A regulated-bounded space [espace control\u00e9-born\u00e9]1. The oldest and for a long \ntime the commonest definition, recently revived by the Robert Sack in Human \nTerritoriality (1986). The predominant meaning of the term in political science \nand international relations. \n6. An animal metaphor borrowed from ethology and biology. Exclusive control \nis often a result of violence. \n7. An \u201aappropriated\u201b space [espace \u00abappropri\u00e9\u00bb]. An extension of the previous \ndefinition. Sometimes used in this sense to refer to the identity component of \nany space. \n8. A historical periodisation. In this usage the history of geography is divided \ninto three phases, corresponding to \u201amilieu\u201b, \u201aspace\u201b, and \u201aterritory\u201b \nrespectively. In this view, territory, with an emphasis on social and individual \nidentity is posited as an alternative to \u201ageometric Cartesian spatialism\u201b. \n \nL\u00e9vy then goes on to outline a series of critiques of these various usages. Each, he \nsuggests, has its advantages, but also its defects. The first four immobilise \n[immobiliser] the term, either by rejecting it, making it take the place of another, or by \naccording it an \u201aexcessively general meaning\u201b (L\u00e9vy, 2003b: 908). \u201aThis is also the \ncase for definition 7, which seems specific, but which in practice designates all social \nspace: what social (which is to say also natural) object is not, in some way, \n16 \n \nappropriated?\u201b (908). The tendency to use \u201aterritory\u201b to refer to portions of space \nthat have acquired subjective or symbolic significance is also unhelpful, L\u00e9vy \nsuggests, since all spaces of interest to human geographers have such characteristics. \nAnglophone geographers\u2019 preference for the term place *lieu] in this context is no \nhelp, L\u00e9vy argues, \u201asince it leads to \u201aplace\u201b being translated as \u201aterritory\u201b and vice \nversa, two terms both elementary and fundamental, but which no geographer can \nconsider to be synonyms\u201b (908). \n \nThe idea of periodisation is also given short shrift, which leaves definitions 5 \n(\u201aregulated and bounded space\u201b) and 6 (ethological). These two definitions, L\u00e9vy \nargues, are specific cases of a larger class of spaces comprising all objects defined by \na continuous or topographical \u201ametric\u201b [m\u00e9trique]. The concept of \u201ametric\u201b or \u201amode \nof measurement and of treatment [traitement] of distance\u201b is relatively unfamiliar in \nthe contemporary Anglophone geographical literature, perhaps because of its spatial \nscientific connotations. L\u00e9vy distinguishes between the two large metrical \u201afamilies\u201b: \nthe topographical, comprising spatially continuous objects, and the topological \ncomprising networks and rhizomes. The outcome of this process of critique and \nclassification is to define \u201aterritory\u201b as \u201ametrical topographical space\u201b [espace \u00e0 \nm\u00e9trique topographique].  \n \nA slightly different spatial typology is developed by Michel Lussault in his recent \nbook L\u2019Homme Spatial (Lussault, 2007). Like L\u00e9vy, Lussault highlights the confusion \nthat surrounds the concept of territory: \n \nA propensity to use territorial vocabulary without defining its boundaries and \nspecifying its content, to establish it as a universal descriptor of all humanised \nspace, in brief to give in to the magic of the word, is particularly notable since \nthe beginning of the 1990s. The problematic character of the this development, \n17 \n \nlet us be clear, resides not in the important diffusion of the term, but in its \nbanalisation, that is to say, its propogation in all directions without precise \nand stable content. In many studies, territory too often becomes a screen \ndisguising a void. (Lussault, 2007: 107)2 \n \nLussault\u2019s solution is to distinguish three types of social space in contrast to L\u00e9vy\u2019s \ntwo. These are place [lieu], area [aire] and network [r\u00e9seau]. Place refers to \n\u201aindivisible space\u201b. The implication is that places exhibit a socio-spatial coherence \nthat would be lost if they were divided. Area, on the other hand, is \u201atopographical, \ndivisible space\u201b. An area consists of contiguous space. Networks, Lussault argues, \ninvolve \u201atopological, discontinuous space\u201b and represent a space of connection. \n \nLussault, like L\u00e9vy, locates the concept of territory in the topographical category: \nindeed he argues that territory is the \u201aideal-type of area\u201b. Lussault identifies three \nmain usages of the term in contrast to L\u00e9vy\u2019s eight. First, he suggests, there is the \n\u201acommon sense\u201b usage that defines territory as \u201aa simple extension of the terrestrial \nsurface, more or less delimited, and supposedly homogeneous\u201b (Lussault, 2007: 108). \nSecond is the political definition of territory, which has the merit of precision. \nFinally, there is the ethological definition, which is the source, according to Lussault, \nof the terminological over-extension referred to above. \n \nThe Political Valorisation of Territory \n \nIn different ways, Levy, Lussault and Paasi all highlight the somewhat divergent \ndiscourses relating to territory in the Anglophone and Francophone literatures. This \ntheme has been explored in some detail by Bernard Debarbieux (1999, see also \nDebarbieux, 2003: 41-43). Anglophone usages tend to be \u201aharder\u201b, emphasising \njuridico-political concerns and stressing (often formal) boundedness and \n18 \n \ninstitutionalisation. In French and other romance languages the senses tend to be \n\u201asofter\u201b, with terms such as the French territoire and Italian territorio frequently \nconnoting \u201aregion\u201b or \u201aplace\u201b (see L\u00e9vy\u2019s third definition above). To take a \nmundane example, the University of Ferrara\u2019s Centro Ricerche Urbane, Territoriale e \nAmbientale (CRUTA) becomes the Centre for Urban, Regional and Environmental \nResearch (my emphasis) in the University\u2019s English language publications. There \nare, though, exceptions in both cases. In the case of English, the OED recognises a \npolitico-juridical definition (\u201athe land or country belonging to or under the \ndominion of a rule or state\u201b), an ethological definition from zoology (\u201aan area \nchosen by an animal or a group of animals and defended against others of the same \nspecies\u201b), and this: \u201aa tract of land, or district of undefined boundaries; a region\u201b. So \nmuch for the taken-for-granted assumption that territories have to have \nboundaries\u2026 In addition there are a number of familiar figurative uses of the term \nin English. Conversely, as we have seen from the work of Michel Lussault, there are \nFrancophone proponents of the view that territoire can and should be defined \nprimarily in political terms (see also Alli\u00e8s, 1980, Raffestin, 1980). \n \nThese complexities and ambiguities reflect (and arguably arise from) the uncertain \netymology of the term. According to the OED it comes from territoire (French), which \nderived in turn from territorium (Latin) meaning the land around a town. Territorium \nis commonly assumed to be linked to terra (earth) but it may also have arisen from \nterrere, meaning to frighten or terrify which also gave territor (frightener). Territorium \nthus meant \u201aa place from which people are warned off\u201b (Roby 1876: 363). According \nto the seventeenth century Dutch jurist Grotius, \n \nThe origin of the word \u201aterritory\u201b as given by Siculus Flaccus  from \n\u201aterrifying the enemy\u201b (terrendis hostibus) seems not less probable than that of \nVarro  from the word for ploughing (terendo), or of Frontius  from the word \n19 \n \nfor land (terra), or of Pomponius the jurist from \u201athe right of terrifying\u201b \n(terrendi iure), which is enjoyed by the magistrates. (Grotius, 1964: 667) \n \nThe link with fear has a particular contemporary resonance. Sextus Pomponius, cited \nby Grotius, was a second century Roman jurist. His definition of \u201aterritory\u201b is \nreproduced in the Corpus Juris Civilis, the great codification of Roman law \nundertaken for the Emperor Justinian in the sixth century: \n \nThe word \u201aterritory\u201b means all the land included within the limits of any city. \nSome authorities hold that it is so called, because the magistrates have a right \nto inspire fear within its boundaries, that is to say, the right to remove the \npeople. (Digest, L. xvi. 239.8) \n \nThis reveals a legal and political connection (if not a definitive etymological one) \nbetween \u201aterritory\u201b and fear and exclusion that dates back to one of the earliest \nrecorded definitions of the term (Connolly, 1995: xii). The present \u201awar on terror\u201b \nhas led some writers to revive the connection between territory and terror (Anidjar, \n2004: 54-60, Cairo, 2004, Hindess, 2006). \n \nAlthough etymology can be suggestive, it is not a substitute for conceptual \nclarification. Lussault\u2019s criticism of the over-extension of territory resonates with the \nrecent call by Bob Jessop, Neil Brenner and Martin Jones for greater precision in the \nuse of spatial terminology (Jessop et al., 2008). Having whittled down through \ncritique his list of eight uses of territory Jacques L\u00e9vy\u2019s settles on a definition that \nincludes the \u201aregulated-bounded\u201b (control\u00e9-bord\u00e9) sense of territory, but also admits \nethological usages. While it may be case that ethologically defined spaces meet \nL\u00e9vy\u2019s criterion of being topographical, and that zoologists will continue to refer to \n20 \n \nthem as territories, my view is that to include them within the geographer\u2019s \ndefinition of territory gives too much ground to socio-biology.  \n \nLussault\u2019s own definition of territory eschews the term\u2019s ethological connotations \nand focuses squarely on the political structuring of space. Territory is a \u201aspace \nstructured by principles of contiguity and continuity\u201b which \u201adepend less on the \nmaterial aspects of space than on the systems of ideas (syst\u00e8mes id\u00e9els) that frame the \nspace in question, as well as the related practices that take place there\u201b (Lussault, \n2007: 113). For Lussault, it is the political valorisation of the spatial continuity and \ncoherence of a delimited area that defines the specificity of territory vis-\u00e0-vis other \ntypes of space (2007: 113-114). \n \nAs Lussault puts it, the dominant ideology at work here invokes the \u201aindispensable \ncontinuum of the \u201aterritorial fabric\u201b (\u00abtissu territorial \u00bb)\u201b (2007: 114). He argues that, \n\u201ain France, particularly, this is accompanied by a denial of the \u201atearing\u201b \n(\u00ab d\u00e9chirure \u00bb) [of the fabric] because this would suggest a \u201asocial fracture\u201b (\u00ab fracture \nsociale \u00bb)\u201b (2007: 114). This involves \n \na powerful territorial representation, used constantly by political actors to \nmake the different elements of their space of action \u201ahold together\u201b, to solidly \nlink discrete units \u2013 places, areas \u2013 and thereby to contribute to the \nproduction of the continuity necessary for the existence of legitimate territory. \n(Lussault, 2007: 114) \n \n\u201aPolitical actors\u201b, says Lussault, \u201aare territorial. They seek and valorise spatial \ncontinuity, whether their territory of reference is local, regional or national\u201b (2007: \n113-114). \n \n21 \n \nProducing Territory-as-Effect: an English Example \n \nAdministrative Regions as Territories \n \nIn the remainder of this paper I want to examine how these effects of contiguity, \ncontinuity and boundedness, are produced and, as Lussault put it, \u201avalorised\u201b. I aim \nto show that the production of \u201aterritory-as-effect\u201b can be understood as the \noutcome of (networked) socio-technical practices. This in turn challenges the \nwidespread assumption that territorial and network understandings of space are \nincommensurable. \n \nI will development my argument through a case study of the English administrative \nregions. Excluding the special case of London, which has an elected mayor and \nassembly, there are eight regions in England, each of which is administered by a \nGovernment Office and a Regional Development Agency whose activities are \noverseen by an appointed Regional Assembly comprising local politicians, business \npeople and representatives of the public and voluntary sectors. Like \u201aterritory\u201b the \nword \u201aregion\u201b is freighted with a wide range of contested and sometimes conflicting \nmeanings. Not all regions are territories or vice versa. However, the eight English \nregions do constitute territories (or territories in formation) in Lussualt\u2019s sense, that \nis, they are represented as delimited, contiguous and coherence political spaces. \n \nAlthough England\u2019s regional institutions have a variety of functions and are \ninvolved in a range of policy domains, one of their most prominent roles is to \npromote economic development. Economic activity is not structured principally in \nterms of territory in Lussault\u2019s sense of the term, bearing in mind that Lussault \nexplicitly distances his definition from the over-extended notion of territory common \nin political economy and economic geography. However, the exercise of regional \n22 \n \nadministrative power in the economic field results in the production of territorial \nunderstandings of economic practices and processes. One such understanding is the \nidea of \u201athe regional economy\u201b. \n \n\u201aThe regional economy\u201b is continually invoked in public discourse by political \nactors, officials, experts, journalists, commentators, organisations in civil society, \nbusiness people and even (occasionally) members of the public. I suggest that, in the \ncase of the English regions it is one of the most significant elements of the \u201aterritory-\neffect\u201b. The possibility of conceiving of \u201athe regional economy\u201b as a focus of policy \nrequires the constitution of a spatio-political object with a number of specific \nfeatures, including Lussault\u2019s trio of delimitation, contiguity and coherence. \nCrucially, the world of economic activity, of the production, consumption, \ndistribution and exchange of goods and services need not, and usually does not, \nhave any of these features. \n \nThe space of the regional economy as policy object must be delimited because the \ninstitutions that act on it have delimited jurisdictions. Thus One NorthEast, the \nregional development agency for north-east England has no powers to intervene in \nthe workings of London\u2019s financial services sector, or in the global commodities \nmarket, even where these have a direct impact on economic activity in its \u201apatch\u201b. \nThe space must also be contiguous, first because the regional economy as policy \nobject is understood as a functional whole whose parts are joined by material \nlinkages that are themselves part of that whole and second because movement \n(whether of goods, people, money, or information) between the parts is assumed \nalso to take place within the space of the whole. \n \nOf course there are instances of non-contiguous territories, including enclaves, \nexclaves, and divided states. Examples include Pakistan between 1947 and 1971, \n23 \n \nwest Berlin prior to German reunification, and Gaza and the Palestinian-controlled \nareas of the West Bank. However, these are exceptions that prove the rule, in the \nsense that they are examples of flawed territories for which special arrangements \nhave to be made. The case of West Bank, in particular, reveals the near impossibility \nof arranging any kind of effective public administration for a fragmented territory; it \nseems like that this would still be case even if the hostile relationship between Israel \nand the Palestinian Authority were resolved. By contrast, the Israeli-controlled areas \nin the Occupied Territories are destined to be contiguous as a result of the \nconstruction of an elaborate road network that passes over, under or through \nPalestinian areas without being part of them. Portions of territory separated only by \nnavigable water are non-contiguous in a less important sense. Examples include the \nFrench DOM-TOMs, the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, Kaliningrad and \nnumerous islands. While cases such as these are often a source of political dispute \nand may present practical problems they are not logically (or perhaps we should say \ntopologically) non-contiguous provided the possibility of access is maintained. \n \nFinally, the space of the regional economy as policy object must be coherent. All \neconomic activity taking place within the space is assumed to form part of the \nregional economy, which is then understood as a totality. That is, the interacting \nparts are thought to constitute a whole that can be treated for policy purposes as a \nunit, albeit one that is heterogeneous and differentiated. \n \nIn the case of the English regions, the effects of territorial delimitation, contiguity \nand coherence are generated partly by the socio-technical constitution of the \n\u201aregional economy\u201b as an object of policy. How does this happen? \n \n24 \n \nEffectuating Territory Technologically \n \nThe short answer is \u201awith difficulty\u201b. Giving effect to territory in this way involves \nthe mobilisation of a whole series of governmental technologies and what Andrew \nBarry (2001) has called \u201apolitical machines\u201b. Barry argues that \u201aa distinction can be \nmade between a technical device, conceived of as a material or immaterial artefact, \nand a technology,  a concept which refers not just to a device in isolation but also to \nthe forms of knowledge, skill, diagrams, charts, calculations and energy which make \nits use possible\u201b (2001: 9).  From this perspective, effectuating territory requires \nconsiderable inputs of labour, expertise and other resources. Moreover, the work \ninvolved is continuous and repetitive. Delimitation, contiguity and coherence have \nto be constantly reproduced to sustain the effect of territory through time. To take a \nsimple example, international border controls are only effective for as long as those \nenforcing them turn up for work each day. Territory doesn\u2019t just happen, it has to be \nworked for. This is not the same as saying that \u201aterritory is the product of social \nconstruction\u201b: \u201ato say that a technology can be political is not \u2026 to claim that \ntechnical devices and artefacts are \u201asocial constructions\u201b or are \u201asocially shaped\u201b: for \nthe social is not something which exists independently from technology\u201b (Barry, \n2001: 9). \n \nWhat kinds of work and technologies go into the effectuation of territory in the case \nof the English regions? In recent years they have included: \n \n numerous regional strategies (regional economic strategies, regional spatial \nstrategies, integrated regional strategies and many others) \n policy reviews such as the British government\u2019s 2007 Review of Sub-national \nEconomic Development and Regeneration (usually known as the sub-national \nreview or SNR) \n25 \n \n statistical measures of economic activity and performance at the regional scale \n a network of regional observatories such as the North East Regional Information \nPartnership (NERIP) \n international benchmarking studies such as the OECD\u2019s territorial reviews \n cartographic mapping such as the Ordnance Survey\u2019s \u201apoints of interest\u201b  \n modelling and forecasting such as the North East Regional Economic Model \ndevised by Durham Business School \n target-setting and auditing including through public service agreements (PSAs) \n \nI do not have space for a detailed consideration of each of these, so I will take the \ncase of target-setting as an example. \n \nPublic service agreements (PSAs) were an innovation introduced by the Tony Blair\u2019s \nNew Labour government in 1998 shortly after it came to power (Financial Times, \n1998). They were invented by Gordon Brown (then Chancellor of the Exchequer \n(finance minister)) and have been a centrepiece of the government\u2019s attempts to \nreform the public sector. The PSAs are formal agreements between HM Treasury \n(finance ministry) and so-called spending ministries including those responsible for \nhealth, transport, education, work and pensions, and defence. The agreements set \nout the level of service, investment or activity expected in each area of public service \nand the performance targets that ministries and their related public bodies are \nexpected to achieve. Politically, the PSAs are a quintessential New Labour device. \nTheir introduction represented a quid pro quo in which the government agreed to \nprovide substantial new investment in public services in exchange for assurances \nabout improved performance. As such they reflected a nervousness on the part of \nthe incoming Blair administration that in the post-Thatcher world the electorate was \nlukewarm about increased public expenditure and needed reassuring that the \nmoney would feed through into tangible improvements in service provision. They \n26 \n \nthus sit within a wider neo-liberal discourse that casts the state as, at best, a \nnecessary evil, and one that needs to be constantly watched lest it become bloated \nand parasitic. \n  \nSince 1998 the PSAs have been regularly revised alongside successive \ncomprehensive spending reviews (CSRs) the announcement of new three-yearly \nspending rounds. In the case of regional economic performance Table 1 shows how \nthe relevant department\u2019s aims and objectives have been modified following \nsuccessive spending reviews and how the PSA target itself has been worded. \n \nThe most recent (2007) revision has seen two notable changes. First, PSA targets are \nnow cross-departmental. This change recognises that many of the problems that \ngovernment policies address do not sit neatly within the remit of individual \ngovernment departments. Improving regional economic performance cuts across the \nwork of the departments of business, transport, work, and universities and \ninnovation as well as the local government department which is the \u201ahome\u201b \ndepartment for regional affairs. Second, there has been a reduction in the number \nand complexity of the PSA targets.  The new PSA target relating to regional \neconomic performance is much simpler than earlier versions. It reads: \n \nPSA 7: Improve the economic performance of all English regions and reduce \nthe gap in economic growth rates between regions. \n \nEach PSA target has designated indicators intended to allow an assessment of \nwhether the target has been met. \n \nFor target 7 these are: \n \n27 \n \n1. Regional Gross Value Added (GVA) per head growth rates \n2. Regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per head levels indexed to the EU15 \naverage \n3. Regional productivity as measured by GVA per hour worked indices \n4. Regional employment rates \n \nLet\u2019s examine the first of these in a bit more detail. Gross value added (GVA) is a \nmeasure of economic production. It is defined as the value added in the process of \nproduction which is equivalent to the value of total output less the value of raw \nmaterials consumed in the process of production (\u201aintermediate consumption\u201b). \n \nAlthough government economists and accountants treat GVA as a neutral, technical \naccounting measure, it has a complex and contested history and geography. Most \nrecently it has spread rapidly through the British public sector. For instance, out of \n163,000 hits in an internet search for \u201agross value added\u201b 43,600 were from the \ngov.uk (British government) domain but only 1,860 were from the .gov (US \ngovernment) domain. This is a direct consequence of the imposition of the PSA \ntarget described above, as is the fact that 47 of the top 100 hits in the search are \nwebsites of UK local or regional government institutions. Many of these document \ndescribe GVA as an important indicator of economic performance, without \nexplaining that it has become important because of target-setting by central \ngovernment. Thus the agency of the state is disguised and the scope for debate about \nalternative measures (such as those relating to environmental sustainability or to \nhealth and well-being) is reduced. \n \nThe burgeoning literature3 on critical accounting studies provides an alternative \nview of GVA and related concepts. Stuart Burchell, Colin Clubb and Anthony \nHopwood (1985) have examined the rise of the notion of \u201avalue added\u201b in Britain in \n28 \n \nthe 1970s. They point out that value added became an important policy concept at a \ntime of widespread industrial unrest, high inflation and restrictive incomes policies. \nThe Labour governments of the time had no wish to endorse the overthrow of \ncapitalism, but they also recognised that the vocabulary of profits and profitability in \ndiscussions of economics risked fuelling discontent in the labour movement with \ngovernment policy and alienating the Labour Party\u2019s core constituency. In that \ncontext the discourse of value added implied that industrial production was a \ncollaborative national effort. In place of a potentially divisive focus on private profit, \nthe fruits of economic activity (value added) could be presented as being shared \nbetween capital in the form of profit and labour in the form of wages. Burchell et al. \nsuggest that this means that value added can thus be seen as a conservative concept. \nAt the same time it can also resonate with the political left by emphasising the \nlegitimacy of worker\u2019s share of output. It also perhaps echoes the Marxian labour \ntheory of value. \n \nIn 1998 the UK adopted a new set of standards for the production of the national \naccounts. These were in accordance with the 1995 European accounting standards \n(ESA95) which were based in turn on the new 1993 agreed international standards \nfor national accounting.4 To mark the introduction of the new standards the British \ngovernment published a set of six A4 format reference volumes including National \nAccounts Concepts, Sources and Methods running to 646 pages. Concepts, Sources and \nMethods provides a detailed description of how the national accounts are compiled, \nwhich is in itself a dramatic illustration of the extraordinary labour that goes into the \ncalculation and monitoring of national economic activity, and of the thoroughly \nartefactual, even fictive character of the national accounts. \n \nConcepts, Sources and Methods identifies the production account (defined as \u201aAccount \nI\u201b in ESZ95) as the core of any set of national accounts \u201aas it records the activity of \n29 \n \nproducing goods and services\u201b (Office for National Statistics, 1998: 59). The \nproduction account records the total value of goods and services produced (output) \nand the total value of raw materials used up in the production process (intermediate \nconsumption). The difference between the two, which is the balancing item on the \nproduction account, is gross value added. Thus an interesting feature of gross value \nadded is cannot be measured directly, but as a balancing item it is instead inferred \n(GVA = output less intermediate consumption). Net value added can be calculated \nby also deducting an allowance for capital depreciation. \n \nAccording to Concepts, Sources and Methods, \u201agross value added is a measure of the \ncontribution to GDP made by an individual producer, industry or sector, and \nprimary incomes are paid out of it; so it is carried forward into the distribution of \nincome accounts\u201b (Office for National Statistics, 1998: 5). Among other things, the \ndistribution of income accounts, show how GVA is \u201adistributed to institutional units \nwith claims on the value added created by production. This shows income from \nemployment (wages and salaries, employer contributions to pension schemes), \noperating surplus (profit) and mixed income (mostly self-employment income)\u201b \n(Office for National Statistics, 1998: 5). The use of the word \u201aclaims\u201b here is notable, \nthough the public accounting standards unsurprisingly do not discuss the power \nrelations that underlie claims-making or the political processes through which \ndifferential claims are made effective. \n \nThe distribution accounts allow alternative ways of calculating GVA to be identified. \nSince all GVA is distributed, the total amount of GVA can be calculated by adding \ntogether employee compensation (wages, salaries and employer pension \ncompensation), profits and the proceeds of self-employment. Similarly, since wages \nand profits are either spent on final consumption or saved GVA in given period \n30 \n \nmust also be equal to the sum of expenditure and saving. Quantitatively, therefore, \nthe following are all equal to GVA: \n \n output less intermediate consumption \n wages plus profits \n expenditure plus savings \n \nIn principle, these arithmetic equalities allow GVA to be calculated not just for the \nnational economy as a whole, but also for component elements such as individual \norganisations, sectors and regions. For example, for a non-profit-making \norganisation, such as a university or a public hospital, GVA is equal to wages (plus \noperating surplus, if any). The concept of GVA is therefore agnostic about whether \nvalue is added by the private, public or voluntary sector and might be seen as \nrunning counter to neo-liberal assertions that the private sector is the only \nproductive part of the economy. \n \nEach mode of calculation should produce the same quantitative results, but in each \ncase the presence of GVA is being derived from other variables. It is in the peculiar \nnature of commodities that it is not possible to look at a finished product, such as a \ncar or a table, and work out directly what proportion of its value was produced by \nwhom. As Marx put it in Capital, \u201athe use-values coat and linen are combinations of, \non the one hand, productive activity with a definite purpose, and, on the other, cloth \nand yarn; the values coat and linen, however, are merely congealed quantities of \nhomogeneous labour\u201b (Marx, 1867\/1976: 135-136 emphasis added). GVA itself is \nunobservable, virtual: a kind of ghostly presence, which becomes more spectral still \nwhen we examine how it is computed in practice at the regional scale. \n \n31 \n \nThe UK government does not produce a full set of public accounts at the regional \nlevel (Office for National Statistics, 1998: 13) and Concepts, Sources and Methods does \nnot detail how regional GVA should be calculated. Instead, the Office for National \nStatistics has published a separate guide to the methodology for the compilation of \nregional accounts and the calculation of regional GVA (Office for National Statistics, \nundated). Regional GVA is calculated using the income approach (GVA = wages plus \nprofits). Moreover, \u201aa \u201atop-down\u201b approach is used to calculate regional figures, \nwhereby the national aggregate is allocated to regions using the most appropriate \nmeasure of regional activity, or regional indicator, available\u201b (Office for National \nStatistics, undated: 5). The annual calculation of regional GVA is a legal European \nUnion requirement and informs EU funding decisions. Regional GVA must be \nbroken down by industrial sector (industry group) and disaggregated to sub-\nregional levels (NUTS2 and NUTS3). \n \nThe choice of the income-based, rather than production-based, mode of calculation \nwas a pragmatic one determined by the available data sources. The top-down \napproach involves apportioning a share of the various income components of \nnational GVA to each region based on information from a variety of data sources. \nSome of these are survey-based, such as the Annual Business Inquiry survey, the \nAnnual Survey of Hours and Earnings, and the Labour Force Survey. Others are \nwhat is described as \u201aadministrative data sources\u201b such as information collected \nthrough the processing of tax and national insurance payments. Although not \nexplicitly stated in the published methodology, the partial reliance on data from \nsample surveys means that figures for regional GVA must be considered to be \nestimates, and subject to sampling error. At the NUTS1 (regional) level, GVA is \ncalculated on both a residence and a workplace basis. Where net inter-regional \ncommuting is an important factor (principally in south-east England) the two \nmethods may produce significantly different figures. The workplace-based figure \n32 \n \nreflects the actual location of production and is required under the European \naccounting standard ESA95. \n \nProfits (approximately 20% of the total)  present practical problems. Although not \nmuch detail is given, the Regional Accounts Methodology Guide states that profits of \ncorporations are allocated partly in proportion to employee earnings. On the face of \nit this seems to assume that the ratio between wages and profits is constant between \nregions. There are also conceptual problems here. In what sense do profits have a \nregional location? In the terms used by the Concepts, Sources and Methods volume, \nthey represent a \u201aclaim\u201b on GVA by proprietors or shareholders. These may be \nindividuals who reside and\/or raise capital outside the region, or they may be \nnational or international institutions who have no regional \u201ahome\u201b. For the \nNorthern Rock bank was regarded as a mainstay of the economy of north-east \nEngland. It is headquartered in Newcastle, but its shares are traded on the London \nstock exchange and could have been bought by anyone looking to invest capital \ndenominated in sterling. When Northern Rock was profitable in what sense did its \nprofits \u201abelong\u201b to the north-east region? Are its more recent losses really the north-\neast\u2019s losses?  These kinds of questions go to the heart of the issue of territory. They \nproblematise the very idea of a regional economy as a bounded space and highlight \nits artefactual character. \n \nCommentaries on the usefulness of GVA have included some notable criticisms. \nAccording to a report from the Institute of Public Policy Research, for example, \n \nGVA has limitations in that it includes only goods and services sold in the \nmarket sector of the economy, or goods not sold on the market whose value is \nimputed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for the purpose of \ncompiling the statistics (for example, many public services such as health and \n33 \n \nstate education). It misses out household production and includes no measure \nfor many of the things that people value in life \u2013 the environment, community \ncohesion, relationships with friends and family, arts and culture, and so on. \nHence it is a highly imperfect measure of the \u201awell-being\u201b of the North. \n(Johnson et al., 2007: 9-10) \n \nThe authors go on to claim that \u201anonetheless, GVA is readily measurable to an \ninternationally agreed standard\u201b (Johnson et al., 2007: 10) which is questionable \ngiven the labour intensive nature of the process involved that has been highlighted \nabove, and the potentially uncertain accuracy of the resulting estimates. \n \nAn overreliance on GVA as the key measure of economic performance was also \ncalled into question by a Parliamentary committee in 2003: \n \nWe also received evidence that the current indicator proposed for the \nmeasurement of performance against this target, regional Gross Value Added \nper head, is not fit for purpose and recommend instead the use of a basket of \nmeasures including productivity, employment and unemployment rates, \nhousehold income and quality of life. (House of Commons ODPM Select \nCommittee, 2003: 3) \n \nAs we have seen above, some of these additional indicators have been included in \nthe latest PSA, although not those relating to household income and quality of life. \n \nDespite these criticism, GVA remains the principal measure of regional economic \nperformance. It is, though, only one of dozens of governmental technologies that \ntogether define and bring into being a political object, \u201athe regional economy\u201b, \nwhich in turn contributes to the effectuation of region-as-territory. Through the \n34 \n \naction of these technologies, the effects of delimitation, contiguity and coherence that \nallow regions to be understood as territories are generated by, for example, the \napportionment of otherwise nomad flows of energy (including labour power), \nmatter, money and information to one geographical area or another. These flows are \nthus, in a sense, subject to territorial coding. However three immediate caveats to \nthis suggestion need to be entered. \n \nFirst, flows are coded for (or to) a territory rather than by territory. Territory is an \neffect of such coding: it does not itself function as an actor, a political subject, or a \ngovernmental technology. According to Andrew Barry (2001: 3), \u201agovernment \noperates not just in relation to spaces defined and demarcated by geographical or \nterritorial boundaries but in relation to zones formed through the circulation of \ntechnical practices and devices.\u201b But I want to go further and suggest that \ngeographical and territorial boundaries are themselves also formed by \u201atechnical \npractices and devices\u201b \u2013 boundaries (delimitations) are not outside technology and \ndo not pre-exist it. Second, the territorial coding of flows, whether retrospective in \nthe case of accounting and auditing technologies or prospective in the case of \nforecasting and modelling technologies, is not the same as capture which involves \nthe material binding of that-which-is-flowing in specific assemblages. Thirdly, \nneither coding nor capture are permanent. Accumulation may be a defining feature \nof capitalism but GVA, for example, does not accumulate endlessly \u201ain\u201b a particular \nterritory. Output is exported or consumed, wages are (mostly) spent, and profits are \noff-shored, consumed, or invested, often elsewhere. To be sure, patterns of uneven \neconomic development may persist for long periods, but they are more like the \npeaks and troughs of atmospheric pressure on a meteorological chart, constituted by \nconstant flux, than they are like the more static contours on a topographical land \nmap. \n \n35 \n \nConclusion \n \nThis perspective suggests that the territory-effect is the product of networked socio-\ntechnical processes in two senses. First, the governmental technologies that produce \nthe effect of territory are the product of spatially extensive networks of human and \nnon-human actors. In the case of my GVA example, the calculation of regional GVA \nrequires the interaction of a host of heterogeneous people and things. These include \nthe internationally agreed System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA93), itself the \nproduct of a collaboration between the United Nations, the European Commission, \nthe International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment and the World Bank. SNA93 provided the framework for the \nEuropean accounting standard ESA95, which in turn drove the production of the \nnew UK national accounts. The mobilisation of these accounting frameworks to \nproduce figures for regional GVA requires the collation of data from diverse sources, \nincluding surveys, taxation returns and employment records. It involves the \nacquisition, maintenance and use of computer hardware and software for storage \nand processing. It makes use of models, maps, and locational data as postcode \nrecords. It requires hundreds of hours of work by accountants, econometricians, IT \nprofessionals, statisticians, clerks and technical writers, all of whom have to be \ntrained, recruited and managed. Transforming the calculations into information that \ncan be accessed and used by non-specialists involves web-designers, publishers, \nresearchers and journalists. The use of this information to make judgements about \nwhether targets have been met involves civil servants and politicians. And all this \nactivity depends on material infrastructures of data networks, routers, filing \nsystems, disks, air conditioning systems, stable electrical supplies and so on and on. \nMost of such heterogeneous networks extend geographically well beyond the \nconfines of any individual regional, or even national territory. \n \n36 \n \nSecond, the matter, energy, information and money that technologies such as \nregional GVA code to one regional territory or another are themselves both the \nproducts of and mobilised by socio-technical networks. It has been fashionable in \nrecent years to ascribe regional economic growth to endogenous factors, such as \nterritorially specific stocks of tangible and particularly intangible assets. But most \nassets are themselves heterogeneous networked phenomena, and when they are \nexamined closely it is difficult to determine which are endogenous and which are \nnot. Take workforce skills and knowledge, one of the principal categories of \nintangible assets. Professional skills and knowledge typically depend on extensive \nnational and international networks of education, training, assessment, continuing \nprofessional development, regulation and exchange. And craft skills, which are often \nthought of as more locally rooted, are also increasingly trans-territorial. Today, after \nall, even winemaking, that apparently most soil-bound of all crafts, is subject to \nextensive inter-regional and international transfers of knowledge, information, \ntechnology and capital. \n \nSo the territory-effect is generated by and depends on networked relations. This \nconclusion runs counter to the widespread view in geography that \u201aterritory\u201b and \n\u201anetwork\u201b are incommensurable forms of spatial organisation. For example, Manuel \nCastells, writing of the contrast between the space of places and the space of flows, \nrefers to \u201aa structural schizophrenia between two spatial logics\u201b (Castells, 1996: 428). \nBoth Jacques L\u00e9vy and Michel Lussault draws a similarly sharp distinction between \nthe topographical metric associated with territory and the topological metric \nassociated with rhizomes and networks (L\u00e9vy, 2003a: 608, Lussault, 2007: 131). \n \nIn Les Territoires du Risque, Val\u00e9rie November posed the question of whether \u201athe \nnotions of network and territory can be articulated together or whether they \ncorrespond to two different explanatory orders\u201b (November, 2002: 273).5 The \n37 \n \nevidence of the spatial effects produced by governmental technologies such as GVA \nsuggests that network and territory can be articulated together \u2013 indeed they always \nare. But the relationship is not symmetrical. Territory is not the timeless and solid \ngeographical foundation of state power it sometimes seems, but a porous, \nprovisional, labour intensive and ultimately perishable and non-material product of \nnetworked socio-technical practices. To return to Timothy Mitchell\u2019s suggestion that \nthe state \u201ashould be examined not as an actual structure, but as the powerful, \nmetaphysical effect of practices that make such structures appear to exist\u201b (1991: 94), \nit seems perhaps appropriate to conclude that territory should be examined not as an \nactual state space, but as the powerful, metaphysical effect of practices that make \nsuch spaces appear to exist. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nAn earlier version of this paper was presented in the New State Spatialities session organised \nby John Harrison and Julie MacLeavy at the 2008 Annual Meeting of the Association of \nAmerican Geographers in Boston and at seminars at Durham University and the Open \nUniversity.
