Introduction  \nThe spatiality of responsibility has been a theme that has received considerable attention from \ngeographers. Thus, geographers have spelt out some of the theoretical bases for responding to \n\u2018the claims of distant strangers\u2019 (Barnett and Land, 2007; Brock, 2005; Corbridge, 1993) and \narguing that responsibility for global poverty is spread far beyond the people who feel its weight \n(see Echanove, 2005). Doreen Massey (2004) makes this responsibility clear when she suggests \nthat global cities like London need to take responsibility for the exploitation that now brings, and \nhistorically has brought them, the resources to establish and maintain their status. She therefore \nhighlights the need to recognise \u2018how those small and highly differentiated bits of all of us which \nposition us as \u2018Londoners\u2019 give rise to responsibility towards the wider relations on which we \ndepend\u2019 (Massey, 2004, 17).   \n \nThis relationality and responsibility extends to academic practices too, requiring us as academics \nto take active steps to recognise the complex spatial relationships between British academic \ngeography and its postcolonial publics (Bonnett, 2003). In this paper we wish to explore some \naspects of this spatiality through the example of international students studying in the UK\u2019s \nHigher Education Institutions (UKHEI)\ni\n.  \n \nThis focus is important for international student mobility has risen by over 300 percent in the last \n25 years (Brunch and Barty, 1998, 18), with active recruitment taking place by many universities \nin the UK, Australia and the US. There has been a corresponding rise in the contribution that \n 3 \ninternational students now make to the total student population in many countries\nii\n. In the UK, \nfor example, the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) shows that in 2005\/06 there were \n330,060 international students, representing 13% of the total English student population, 15% in \nScotland, 12% in Wales and 11% in Northern Ireland \n(http:\/\/www.ukcosa.org.uk\/pages\/hestats.htm accessed July 2007\niii\n). But the significance of \ninternational students is not simply about numbers or their proportions within the whole student \nbody. Rather, it is the relative neglect of the questions they pose for thinking responsibly about \nacademic geography, that is of particular interest here. International students thus offer an \n\u2018obvious place\u2019 (Barnett, 1995) from which to engage with how responsibility may be enacted, \nor disavowed, through everyday academic lives\niv\n. \n \nTo do this, the paper unravels how responsibility and care of international students can be \ninformed by the spatial challenges of a postcolonial frame. In drawing on a postcolonial analysis \n(see Raghuram et al, this issue), the paper challenges contemporary debates that seek to present \nthe internationalisation of UKHE\nv\n as a \u2018neutral experience\u2019 within normalizing conceptions of \ninternationalisation, and instead moves towards a more \u2018layered\u2019 understanding that highlights \nthe connections between the geographical, historical, political, economic and cultural spheres in \norder for an \u2018engaged pedagogy\u2019 to emerge. This approach is important, for according to Rizvi et \nal. (2005), contemporary debates about the relationship between globalisation and education tend \nto reify the latter and provide universalising explanations that fail to adequately address specific \nhistorical and political contexts. They therefore suggest that postcolonial theories can perform a \nvaluable role in showing how \u2018contemporary social, political, economic and cultural practices \ncontinue to be located within the processes of cultural domination through the imposition of \n 4 \nimperial structures of power\u2019 (Rizvi et al., 2005, 1). Thus this paper traces some ways in which \nacademics\u2019 responsibilities towards (all) students are shaped by the complex spatialities that are \ninherited, at least in some part, both from the history of colonialism and the implications of these \nhistorical connections for present-day transnational relationships. In doing so, we take up \nGilmartin and Berg\u2019s (2007, 123) criticism that \u2018British postcolonial geography is dominated by \ncritiques of the discursive construction of historical colonialism\u2019, and rather we actively focus on \n\u2018the aftermath and continuation of colonialism\u2019 in academic practices. This intervention in \u2018the \ncontemporary\u2019 is particularly important at a time when postcolonialism has been criticised for \nfailing to understand current conditions (Lavia, 2007, 288). \n \nOur use of the terms care and responsibility are routed through a postcolonial frame. Both terms \nhave a multiplicity of meanings in the literature. In considering care, for example, distinctions \nhave been made between taking caring of, caring about, care-receiving and care-giving (Tronto, \n1993), between care as motivation and care as an end (Sander-Staudt, 2006) and between care as \nethic and care as practice (Popke, 2006). Meanwhile responsibility has been considered with \nrespect to responsibilities towards the so-called \u2018distant stranger\u2019 (Corbridge, 1993), responsible \nresearch praxis and citizenship (Gibson, 2006), responsible consumption (Barnett et al., 2007) \nand responsibilities towards the environment (Hobson, 2006).  In this paper we specifically build \non the literature that explores the relationships between postcolonialism (as a marked category), \nresponsibility and care (see for example, Bosco, 2007). As such, we consider care and \nresponsibility in the context of past and present inequalities in a postcolonial world, an approach \nwhich insists upon a \u2018care-full\u2019 recognition of postcolonial interaction and the spatialities \ninvolved therein. This approach contests the bases upon which responsibility and care have \n 5 \nlargely been constructed thus far, by challenging the idea of proximate and distant relations \n(Barnett et al., 2008) and by questioning the centre from which care and responsibility can be \ntalked about. (For a more comprehensive discussion of a postcolonial analysis of care and \nresponsibility see Raghuram et al, this issue). So a postcolonial approach to responsibility and \ncare is adopted in this paper, in both rethinking the spatialities involved in international student \nmobility and in sensitising ourselves to the \u2018voice\u2019 through which such concerns are usually \narticulated.  \n \nThe rest of the paper is divided into four sections. In the first section, we briefly review current \ndebates on international students which reveal the lack of literature specifically focusing on the \ncomplex relational ties involved in caring for and thinking responsibly about international \nstudents. In the second section we therefore suggest that a postcolonial analysis is of great help \nin bringing out these relationalities and responsibilities, in particular in working towards an \n\u2018engaged pedagogy\u2019 that is informed by a more complex view of what it means to be \n\u2018international\u2019. In the third section, we outline some ways in which a postcolonial frame \nenables a re-thinking of these spatialities of responsibility in the particular context of the \ninternationalisation of UKHE. This moves us to conclude, in section four, that to articulate \nresponsibility and care as a basis for a politics, we must explore the multiple historical \nmaterialities of spatial relationships. We argue that consciousness of geographically-routed \npower dynamics is necessary for generating forms of engaged political praxis. In other words, \nto consider responsibility and care as relational terms, is to take seriously how these terms \nmight appear for those who are cared for and for whom we might be responsible. Ultimately, \n 6 \nwe want to ensure that there are no ossifying certainties about care and responsibility (cf \nRaghuram et al, this issue).   \n \n2. International students: current debates  \nThe number of international students enrolling on courses at UK institutions more than doubled \nover the ten years from 1996-97 to 2005-06 (Tysome, 2007). In 2005\/06, international students \nmade up 11 percent of full-time first degree students, 65 percent of full-time taught \npostgraduates and 41 percent of all research postgraduates in the UKHE sector\nvi\n. The top five \nnon-EU sending countries were China (PRC), India, United States of America, Malaysia and \nNigeria while the top five in the EU were Greece, Republic of Ireland, Germany, France and \nCyprus (http:\/\/www.ukcosa.org.uk\/pages\/hestats.htm accessed July 2007, see also Table 1). \nAlthough international students are located throughout the UKHE sector, they are particularly \nconcentrated in specific institutions, especially in London. For example, 64 percent of students at \nthe London School of Economics and Political Science are classified as international, 37 percent \nat Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine and 32 percent at University College \nLondon. By contrast, the highest proportions of international students found outside London are \nlocated at The University of Oxford (26%), Warwick University (25%) and University of \nCambridge (21%). Similarly, international students are concentrated in special subject areas, \nwith most students being located in Business and Administrative studies, Engineering and \nTechnology and Social, Economic and Political Studies \n(http:\/\/www.ukcosa.org.uk\/pages\/hestats.htm accessed July 2007, see also Table 2). It is clear \nthen that there are distinct spatial, temporal and sectoral patterns in international student \ndemographics in UKHE Institutions\nvii\n.  \n 7 \nInsert Tables 1 and 2 here  \nNumerically, international students represent an important and growing component of UKH\nviii\n. \nThis growth in numbers of international students has been matched by growing academic debates \nabout the issues that international student mobility presents\nix\n. In brief, this literature may be \nsummarised as having three broad interests, as discussed below.  \n \nThe first set of literatures may be said to be loosely focusing on migration and mobility of \nstudents within the context of migration policy (Waters, 2006). In this literature, students are also \nviewed as incipient skilled migrants (Kuptsch, 2005) in \u2018the race for skills\u2019 (Ziguras and Law, \n2006) and migration is seen as one way of channelling skills that are in formation. By offering \nextension of stay for immigrants with the right skills (Tremblay, 2005) and preferential treatment \nin points-based systems of migration (Baas, 2006; Hazen and Alberts, 2006), international \nstudents are encouraged to contribute their newly acquired skills to developing the economies of \ndestination states (Findlay and Stam, 2006; King and Ruiz-Gelices, 2003) or indeed to return \nhome to economically \u2018develop\u2019 sending countries.  \n \nA second set of concerns centre around the pedagogic issues raised by student mobility.  Much \nof this literature separately interrogates either educator practises, or students themselves in order \nto explore how to improve student experiences. For example, some studies have tried to explore \nwhy different educators respond differently to international students (Schuherholz-Lehr, 2007) in \norder to outline the kinds of shifts in educator behaviour that might be necessary. Others have \nfocused on educators, not just as purveyors of curriculum but as producers of what counts as \nknowledge, suggesting that the curriculum might need to be explored in the context of rising \n 8 \nnumbers of international students (Haigh, 2002; Jackson, 2003).  Singh and Doherty (2004) and \nAsmar (2005), for example, are mindful of the dilemmas of balancing issues of cultural \nsensitivity against assimilation within prevailing curricula whilst Bradley (2000) has questioned \nthe ability, in practice, for university educators to transcend different socio-cultural value \nsystems. Research on student experiences, on the other hand, unpicks impediments to the \ninternational students\u2019 learning experience (Scheyvens et al., 2003). This literature highlights the \npedagogic dilemmas posed by students\u2019 knowledge and use of English in both written work and \noral classroom culture in ways that are familiar or are validated by their teachers and assessors. \nDifferences in the nature of academic hierarchies (and hence what can be said by students to \ntheir teachers), rhetorical tradition and educational styles (typically with an overemphasis on \nmemory) too are cited as significant in disadvantaging international students (Koehne, 2006). \nHowever, more critically aware work has challenged the cultural stereotyping of international \nstudents as simply erasing the different forms that the hierarchies, stereotypes and linguistic \nstyles take in receiving contexts (Bullen and Kenway, 2003). Thus, Tucker (1995), for instance, \nargues that students are not only products of culture but also produce their own pedagogic \ncultures, which will appeal to diverse readers. Hence, a second strand of literature is developing \nwhich aims to move from how to make international students recognise, adapt and conform, to \nhow teachers and international students might together craft pedagogical styles that serve the \npolitical purposes of academic practices. This is a literature which moves to more clearly tie \neducator and student together in dialogic processes. \n \nMost productive for us is a third strand of work that explores international students as an inherent \npart of wider processes of internationalisation of HE. For instance, there is an evolving literature \n 9 \nwhich includes the development of offshore campuses and exchange programmes. This range of \nwork considers the political, cultural and economic effects and policies of \ninternationalisation\/globalisation of HE (Gacel-\u00c1vila, 2005; Kong, 2007a; Schoorinan, 1999). It \nalso explores the governability of the global \u2018eduscape\u2019 (Luke, 2005). Teichler (2004), for \nexample, debates whether globalisation of HE can be viewed as a manifestation of \u2018turbo-\ncapitalism\u2019 or whether it should be viewed instead as a move towards \u2018global understanding\u2019 \nwhile Burbules and Torres (2000) have critiqued this universalized approach to understanding \neducation and globalization, arguing for the need to foreground the significance of contextual \nsocioeconomic factors in understanding changing education patterns.  \n \n3. Framing a postcolonial \u2018engaged pedagogy\u2019 \nIt is this third vein of literature about the process of internationalisation of HE that we want to \nadd to, but we want to do this from a postcolonial frame. This is because the ambivalence of the \nlongstanding engagement between postcolonial theory and education can set the conditions for \nrethinking an internationalised HE sector. Thus, according to Rizvi et al. (2006, 257): \n\u2018Postcolonialism\u2019s contentions, surrounding the relationship between knowledge and power, are \nlinked directly to education, both as an institution where people are inculcated into hegemonic \nsystems of reasoning and as a site where it is possible to resist dominant discursive practices. In \nthis way, education has a systematically ambivalent relation to postcolonialism. On the one hand, \nit is an object of postcolonial critique regarding its complicity with Eurocentric discourses and \npractices. On the other hand, it is only through education that it is possible to reveal and resist \ncolonialism\u2019s continuing hold on the geographical imagination. Education is also a site where \nlegacies of colonialism and the contemporary processes of globalization intersect.\u2019 Thus our aim \n 10 \nin pursuing a postcolonial analysis is to deploy the figure of the international student as a \nglobalised agent, capable of forging a truly global discipline (and before which the carefully \nbounded agency of the \u2018active learner\u2019 rather pales, see Biggs, 2003 and Haggis, 2003). In so \ndoing, we do not focus on how to teach the international student, as if this category of student \nsomehow exclusively embodied difference in terms to teaching: to do that would be to \noverdetermine the term \u2018international\u2019 as a marker of difference, homogenising both the \u2018home\u2019 \nstudent (despite longstanding recognition of the salience of for example age, gender, class, and \nethnicity in pedagogy and performance) and international\u2019 students (who are also internally \ndifferentiated in terms of nationality in addition to other markers of identity). Our aim in using a \npostcolonial analysis is to focus on that very porousness of the lecture room wall that is \nhighlighted by the complex geographies of international students, to insist that, in order to be \nresponsible to all students, \u2018pedagogy is removed from limited notions of instrumentalist values \nof instruction and didactic relationships with students. Rather, pedagogy is considered as having \npolitical and strategic intent, linking histories and biographies with issues of culture, power and \npolitics\u2019 (Lavia, 2007, 297).  \nReference to bell hooks' concept of \u2018engaged pedagogy\u2019is particularly instructive here. In \nTeaching to Transgress (1994, 13) hooks argues emotively for a progressive, holistic, \nparticipatory education, an \u2018engaged pedagogy\u2019, one that \u2018cares for the souls\u2019 of students.  To be \nable to care, hooks argues, will place demands upon educators in terms of authenticity and \ncommitment. So for hooks, engaged pedagogy is more demanding than critical or feminist \npedagogy because it insists that the teacher has the responsibility to work towards self-\nactualization, to be aware of themselves as practitioners and as human beings, if they wish to \nteach students in a non-threatening, anti-discriminatory, empowering way. So for hooks, self-\n 11 \nactualisation should be the goal of the teacher as well as the student although she recognizes that \nthis is not easy: \u2018It was difficult to maintain fidelity to the idea of the intellectual as someone \nwho sought to be whole- well-grounded in a context where there was little emphasis on spiritual \nwell-being, on the care of the soul. Indeed, the objectification of the teacher within bourgeoisie \neducational structures seemed to denigrate notions of wholeness and uphold the idea of the \nmind\/body split, one that promotes and supports compartmentalization.\u2019 In order to resist this \nsplit, hooks adopts Thich Nhat Hanh\u2019s philosophy of engaged Buddhism, with the focus on \npractice in conjunction with contemplation, and notes its similarity to Freire's focus on \u2018praxis\u2019- \naction and reflection upon the world in order to change it.  \nFor hooks then (1994, 33): \u2018To commit ourselves to the work of transforming the academy so \nthat it will be a place where cultural diversity informs every aspect of our learning, we must \nembrace struggle and sacrifice.\u2019 In embracing this struggle, hooks\u2019 (2003) pedagogy is one that \nis responsive to the specific situation of each particular group of students and she sees education \nas taking place not only in the classroom but also outside formal teaching contexts. This chimes \nwith our emphasis on the porousness of lecture room walls, but unlike hooks we want to focus on \nhow what is happening outside the classroom actually shapes classroom pedagogies. This project \nis, then, not simply about teaching practices in relation to international students, but rather one of \nthinking about the discourses, power hierarchies, and social relations that shape international \nstudents\u2019 presence in the UK. Such an approach is really important, for not only has previous \nwork on international students tended to be seriously undertheorised in Britain (Walker, 1999) \nbut according to Leonard et al (2003, 20), this research to date tends to be \u2018\u2026pragmatic, \nimplicitly positivistic\u2026and rarely presented in the context of current higher education policy and \ngovernance...This means that the experiences of international students are often examined \n 12 \nwithout consideration of the environment that frames them.\u2019 Hence, concern here is not limited \nto caring for students i.e. the face-to face care that is involved in the classroom but also extends \nto caring about the international conditions that shape students\u2019 experiences (Tronto, 1993). It is \nthe productive possibilities of thinking about internationalisation and its particular spatialities as \npart of engaged postcolonial pedagogy where our particular contribution lies.  \n \n4. Re-thinking the multiple spatialities of international students  \nIn this section we therefore begin by laying out the discursive frames through which \ninternationalisation is generally framed by UK policy makers. We then move on to highlight the \n\u2018limits, silences and problems\u2019 inherent in these current ways of thinking about international \nstudents in order to open up internationalisation to a more power-laden, critical and emotional \nanalysis. We do this by making apparent the (often hidden) multiple spatialities of international \nstudents. \n \nDiscursive framings \nThe growth in international student numbers in the UK has been supported by three main \ndiscursive frames. The first frame supporting the drive for recruiting international students to \nUKHE is a recognition of the importance of international students to the financial health of UK \nuniversities (and beyond). International student recruitment has helped to keep UKHEIs, and \nespecially particular courses within some institutions, viable within the context of falling \nnumbers within the university going age-group. Tysome (2007), for example, reported that in \n2005-06, more than a fifth of students enrolled on courses in strategic subjects such as \n 13 \nengineering, mathematics, computer science, physics and chemistry, came from outside the UK \n- and at postgraduate level, international students represented nearly half of those joining \ncourses in these areas. International students were particularly prevalent in electronic and \nelectrical engineering, chemical and energy engineering, metallurgy, minerals technology, and \nagricultural sciences - making up about a third of full-time students in these disciplines, which \nwere all finding it hard to attract UK students in 2005-06. Moreover, the high fees charged to \ninternational students have also enabled the government to increase the number of UK students \nin HE without a proportionate increase in taxes (Findlay and Stam, 2006, 4).  \n \nThus recent estimates suggest that international student fees contribute more than 1.5 billion to \nBritish universities (Asthana, 2007, 17) and that almost ten percent of all HE teaching income \ncomes from non-EU student fees (Ramsden, 2001). In addition, a British Council report put the \nexport value of education and training as a whole at \u00a328 billion, more than the financial services \nand car industries (Attwood and Tahir, 2007) while a HE Report from Universities UK reported \nthat from 2001-02 to 2005-06, a 52 per cent increase in tuition fee income was \u2018to a considerable \nextent\u2019 attributable income from to international students (Tysome, 2007). The Higher Education \nPolicy Institute (HEPI) also estimated that fee income and living expenditure from overseas \nstudents from outside Europe contributed at least \u00a33.3 billion annually to the UK economy whilst \nthe rise in gross domestic product resulting from international students who stay to work in the \nUK was estimated to be about \u00a31 billion a year (Newman, 2007a). International students have \nthus helped to allay the running costs of UK HEI but have also contributed to the growth of local \neconomies through their spending (see Table 3). And this has been achieved through what \n 14 \nKhadria (2001) calls the \u2018silent backwash of remittances\u2019, money flowing out from poorer \ncountries to richer countries in the form of overseas student fees (see especially Khadria, 2007)\nx\n. \n \nInsert Table 3 here \n \nBut the contribution of international students is not limited to the financial fate of universities but \nalso extends to a recognition of their role in research within the context of wider decline in \nresearch and development funding in the UK. The magnetic ability of the US to recruit \nresearchers from across the world, including the UK, it is feared will lead to a decline of UK \nuniversities\u2019 competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis US universities. The attempt to address the \u2018skills gap\u2019 in \nscience and engineering, through student and worker immigration (Findlay and Stam, 2006) is \nthus, the second discourse framing increased international student recruitment. It is hoped that \nthis migration of highly-skilled persons will help the UK to maintain a competitive edge within \nthe context of \u2018knowledge societies\u2019. \n \nHowever, it is also recognised that international students will help to constitute the body of UK \nHEI but will also increase the international reach of the UK. This third discourse thus relates to \nthe UK\u2019s attempt to improve its \u2018global presence\u2019 more generally. So international education has \nbeen branded as a \u2018wider good\u2019, whereby the UK takes up its responsibilities in a globalising \nworld. Thus the UK Council for International Education (UKCOSA) suggest that:  \n\u2018international diversity on our campuses enriches the environment for all staff and \nstudents. Perhaps most importantly, their familiarity with the UK will allow them to \ninfluence others \u2013 positively or negatively, depending on their experiences \u2013 both in \ntheir home countries and wherever else in the world they go. Over and above our \nresponsibility to ensure a higher quality of experience for all of our students, as \nfuture partners in diplomacy, trade and cultural exchange, and as people likely to \n 15 \nbecome influencers and decision-makers, we should take very seriously the \nquestion of whether international students\u2019 experiences of the UK are positive\u2019 \n(UKCOSA , 2004, 2)\nxi\n.  \n \n \nThis targeting of international students as \u2018cultural ambassadors\u2019 for UK HEIs is part of wider \nmoves to both internationalise HE and to recognise international students\u2019 role in the wider \n\u2018securitisation\u2019 of both knowledge and of migration.. Initiatives developed to internationalise \nUKHE include the UK-India Education and Research Initiative (UKIERI), which was set up in \n2005 to substantially improve educational links between the UK and India (see \nhttp:\/\/www.ukieri.org\/). Similarly, the Development Partnerships in Higher Education \n(DeLPHE) initiative in 2006 aims to support partnerships between HEIs in the UK and overseas \nto \u2018find new ways to fight global poverty\u2019. Specifically DeLPHE will encourage projects aiming \nto promote science and technology in Africa and Asia (see \nhttp:\/\/www.britishcouncil.org\/learning-delphe.htm). International education thus becomes \nframed as part of \u2018good global citizenry\u2019 whist also ensuring that international students become \nbearers of sensitive knowledge of places that are economically, as well as geopolitically, \nimportant to the UK.  \nThus, the discourses surrounding the current growth in international student numbers in the UK \nare quite complex. Overall, government policies have been based on recognising, although not \nnecessarily respecting, the constitutive role of international students in buttressing the UK \neconomy, its HE institutions and also in helping the UK to make a \u2018place in the world\u2019. But these \ndiscursive frameworks only highlight \u2018one side of the equation\u2019- what international students can \n\u2018do\u2019 for the UK. What remains hidden beneath these discourses is the mutuality, the \ninterdependence and mutual constitution of UKHEIs and international students. What we wish to \n 16 \ndo now is to unsettle these normalising, partial frameworks, by thinking through the  \ninternationalisation of UKHE from a postcolonial perspective, which involves a recognition of \nboth the connections, disconnections and new connections of co-constitution that shape the \ninternational student experience. These involve both colonial spatial imaginaries and how these \nweave into postcolonial connections to influence the internationalisation process today. In the \nnext section we therefore move towards re-conceptualising the relationships both inside and \noutside the classroom, to see international students as part of wider internationalisation processes \nboth in the past and in the present, and thus to interrogate the category \u2018international\u2019 in the oft \nused category international students. In doing so, we will focus on the complex relational ties \ninvolved in the internationalisation of HE, and consequently the implications of this for academic \npractice in caring for and thinking responsibly about, not only international students, but all \nstudents in an internationalised system.   \nColonial spatial imaginaries \nThe international spaces most easily reached, and most apparently \u2018obvious\u2019 are those to which \nthe UK has been linked through colonial heritage. Thus the initial impetus for many international \nstudents to come to study in Britain was rooted in the structures of academic imperialism that \nemanated from the colonial period, in which a qualification gained from the \u2018mother country\u2019 \nattained considerable cultural, economic and emotional value. This long-standing influence of \nWestern education in creating the colonised mind (Bhabha, 1993) has been of considerable \ninterest to postcolonial writers for a long time. And its effects can also be felt through this \nexcerpt from Jamaica Kincaid\u2019s (1996, 59-60) fictional autobiography set in Trinidad, where the \nmain protagonist in the novel talks of her educational experience: \n 17 \n\u2018I also knew the history of an array of people I would never meet. That in itself \nshould not have kept me from knowing of them; it was only that this history of \npeoples that I would never meet-Romans, Gauls, Saxons, Britons, the British \npeople-had behind it a malicious intent: to make me feel humiliated, humbled, \nsmall\u2026.Once I had identified and accepted this malice directed at me, I became \nfascinated with this expression of vanity: the perfume of your own name and your \nown deeds is intoxicating, and it never causes you to feel weary or exhausted; it is \nits own inspiration, it is its own renewal.\u2019 \n \nKincaid here reveals how education as a colonial project was focused on encouraging the \ncolonised mind (see Wa Thiong\u2019o, 1981) but crucially was also always mirrored by an \naffirmation of the colonising subject \u2013 as Achille Mbembe argues: \u2018The subject that the colonizer \nis, is a subject stiffened by the successive images he or she makes of the native\u2026  That is why, \nto exist, the colonizer constantly needs the native as that animal that serves as the support for the \ncolonizer\u2019s self-consciousness\u2019 (Mbembe, 2001, 188).   \n \nHowever, knowledge has never been simply or completely \u2018transferred\u2019 from \u2018centre\u2019 to \n\u2018margin\u2019. Colonial knowledge aggregated, mushroomed, was disturbed and found an altered \nvoice in particular institutional settings. Thus Mills (2006) offers a forceful account of British \nlate-colonial efforts to export its model of HE to Africa. In his paper he challenges any simple \ninterpretation of the \u2018Asquith commission\u2019 university colleges - such as Makerere or University \nCollege Ibadan - as alien impositions or colonial intellectual \u2018hothouses\u2019. Focusing on Makerere \nUniversity in Uganda, and drawing on a variety of archival and personal sources, he shows how \nits students and faculty engaged in an ambivalent recreation and subversion of the Western idea \nof the university and its foundational discourses. He thus suggests that the institution offered a \nspace to question and debate the purpose of an African university education. Students and staff \nmade use of their limited political autonomy to challenge and rework the colonial hierarchies of \n 18 \nrace and culture. As a result, Makerere remained an influential forum for intellectual debate, \ncultural expression and social critique until the mid 1970s and, according to Hill (2006), remains \nan important historical legacy from which to rethink the future of African universities. \n \nFurther, a focus not only on the complications of education and colonialism but also on \neducation and anti-colonialism highlights the strategic importance of international students as a \nsharply influential group in the first half of the twentieth century in shaping anti-colonial \nmovements. Lahiri (2000), for example, gives a compelling account of how Indian students \nstudying in Britain prior to the two world wars would later shape both the nationalist movement \nin Indian and construct policies in the newly independent Indian nation after 1947. What is \ninteresting here is that colonial education did not appear only as legacy but rather came to spark \nnew spatial imaginaries \u2013 including those of an independent nation. As many postcolonial writers \nhave acknowledged, internationalism was an inherent part of nationalism (James, 1998).  \n \nIn an interview with David Scott, George Lamming, a famous Barbadian novelist, fleshes out \nsome of the complexities of colonial inheritances of spatial imaginaries (Scott, 2002).  First, he \ntalks about the huge influence that visits to the house (and even more so the library) of a French \nand English teacher, Frank Collymore, in Trinidad had on him. In particular, it led him to the \ndiscovery that there were a people and a history outside something called the British Empire and \nBarbados. So despite the proximity of other Caribbean islands, it was the incommensurable \ndistance between the islands (particularly between Barbados and the islands that were not part of \nthe British Empire) that became apparent to Lamming. Thus rrelationships with one place can be \nproduced at the expense of that with others. Spaces which are not linked through the history of \n 19 \nempire, though physically proximate, may be distanciated and this distanciation is often a \ntechnique of ruling. Awareness of some relations gets occluded, other heightened. Secondly, the \ninterview provides a glimpse into the tremendous intellectual fervour of these meetings not only \nin Collymore\u2019s house in Trinidad but also later in the UK to which he moved as a writer, and \nwhere Lamming met many of those who had a formative influence on him. Significantly, was a \nsense of a Caribbean identity that emerged from these meetings in the UK. This development of \npan-Caribbeanness within the UK is also noted by Winston James (1993, 255):  \n\u2018Caribbeans in Britain and North America have a better sense of and empathy for \nthe cultures of the Caribbean as a whole than the majority of their counterparts who \nreside in the Caribbean itself.\u2019   \nSo here we get a glimpse of the ways in which a postcolonial analysis of education in relation to \nthe \u2018international student\u2019 is not only about the mutual constitution of ex-colony and ex-\ncoloniser, but is also about the constitution of a range of relationships between spaces that are \nnot entirely determined through their relations with each other, indeed may even strongly resist \nbeing so (Mufti, 2005).  As we have seen, colonialism, anti-colonialism and distance (sometimes \nas (in)difference) have all left their legacy on knowledge in different geographical contexts. It \nhighlights the wide range of spatial imaginaries, based not only on exclusivity and separateness \n(as in the case of independence movements) and not only on historical connection, but also on \nnew spaces of affiliation and belonging that already exist and can be drawn upon on thinking in \nan engaged manner about international students. Being a part of, but still being apart from, \ntherefore entails responsibilities to both take account of and be accountable to, both the \nconnections and the disconnections, these different spaces and their distinctive world picturing \n(cf Noxolo et al., 2008). It particularly requires academic geographers to recognise the fluidity of \nthe incredibly rich spatial imaginaries that internationalisation may bring with it.   \n 20 \n \nPostcolonial legacies  \nThese interconnected imaginaries have, at least to some extent, continued through the \npostcolonial era, enabled- indeed facilitated precisely - through the mobile bodies of \ninternational students. For instance, Ock Park (2004) shows how Korean modern geography has \ngrown rapidly since the 1960s, being greatly influenced by the Korean geographers who received \nPhD degrees in the United States and returned home to teach at universities in Korea, especially \nin the 1970s and early 1980s. According to Ock Park (2004), American geography has directly \nand indirectly influenced the progress of geography in Korea in various ways \u2014 education \nsystems, curricula for college students, training graduate student and research methodologies.  In \nthis way, postcolonial writers have always been clear that wider international power relations and \ninequalities structure both the teaching practices and the knowledge content of pedagogical \npractice, so that the walls of the lecture room are inevitably porous. \nThus recognition of what internationalisation might mean begins with a fuller awareness of the \nagency of international students in the construction of geographical knowledge, variously \nconstructed in different geographical contexts. For instance, Kong (2007a, 14) suggests that \u2018the \nhistorical pathways of a country\u2019s development as well as its institutions and policies shape the \nkind of geographical knowledge (re) produced in each national context\u2019. So in China in the \ncontemporary period, for example, the state wields a strong influence on HE, including \nrecommending the text books that should be used (Xiaojian et al, 2007). In South Africa, by \ncontrast, Mather (2007) documents how the development of the geography discipline reflects the \napartheid legacies of the country whilst more recent research agendas have focused on applied \n 21 \nquestions of reconstruction and development. However, in Singapore, Kong (2007b) argues that \nthe geography discipline\u2019s shape and trajectory is more fully shaped by the international as well \nas the national context, with global networks and flows of both teaching and research being \nshaped by conditions elsewhere in the world, particularly the Anglophone world, given that \nEnglish is the working language in Singapore. (For other examples of geography in other \ncontexts see the special issue of Journal of Geography in Higher Education, 2007, volume 31, 1).   \nInternational students should therefore be seen not as passive recipients of a rarefied \u2018UK\u2019 \ngeographical knowledge, but as agents of the flows of geographical knowledge within the global \ndiscipline, from and to the specific places that the students are coming from.  This agency is \nhistorically shaped, so that the ways in which these places have been differently tied into \ngeopolitical relationships with Britain will influence the manner in which each individual student \nis inserted into HE in Britain. Nevertheless, it is not historically determined: there are great \ndifferences in the construction and development of geography in different places and \ninternational students embody these differences but also shape and offer scope for building some \nshared agendas. \nHowever, these linkages are not lost but are drawn upon in constituting the category international \nstudents. And there are different ways in which the linkages are both drawn upon, but also \ndisavowed, in order to create UK education as desirable. For example, one important tool in the \narsenal of connections on which to draw in international students is language. For example, \norganisations such as the British Council (itself a successful postcolonial institution) have \nutilised the postcolonial power of English in trying to sell UK postgraduate degree.  \u2018You'll gain \nrecognised and respected qualifications\u2019, \u2018It's fantastic value\u2019. \u2018You can improve your English\u2019 \n 22 \n(http:\/\/www.educationuk.org\/pls\/hot_bc\/page_pls_user_article?x=516513202912&y=0&a=0&d\n=1143, accessed July 2007) draw on the discourse of the universality of English language\nxii\n (see \nKachru, 1995 and Wa Thiong'o, 1981) and the value of the UK as the home of that language.  \n \nHowever, while the UK can claim to be the centre of English language, it is the wider purchase \nof the UK and its language that allows the British Council to talk about the universal value of an \nEnglish education, which is \u2018respected and valued all over the world\u2019 and will \u2018give you an edge \nover the competition\u2019. But colonialism has also multiplied the sites where such transferable \nknowledge may be acquired. Thus, Waters (2006) shows how international education allows \nmiddle class people from Hong Kong to accumulate a valuable form of cultural capital through a \nWestern university degree and to use this to reproduce and even enhance their social class \npositionings back home in Hong Kong\nxiii\n. These findings are also echoed by Koehne\u2019s (2006) \nwork with international students. In an interview with a male Malaysian Indian PhD student \nstudying in Australia, Koehne\u2019s (2006, 244) found that an Australian education provides the very \nthing that the UK can claim to provide \u2013 social mobility through language:  \n \u2018\u2026I think we have to agree that, especially in the urban areas the English language \nhas a tremendous influence\u2026.there are a lot of the thought patterns, the way you \nsee the world, a lot of it is influenced by English\u2026.I felt that the English way of \nimmense benefit, because, look at the kind of information you are going to get \nusing another other language, and the access to knowledge through the English \nlanguage is tremendous, right, so it is a gateway to knowledge, and in my country at \nleast right now if you have a good proficiency level, if you are competent, lots of \nopportunities, so I see it as social mobility as well\u2019. \n  \nAustralia has also strengthened its position relative to the UK in recruiting international students \nboth through its physical proximity to the big south and south east Asian markets but also by \n 23 \nembedding its relationships with students by offering half the migration points needed to settle in \nAustralia to those who obtain a postgraduate qualification there.  \n  \nAnother long-lost colony \u2013 the US \u2013 also has had an even greater drawing power for \ninternational students, because of the numerous grants it offers international students. A recent \nreport by Asthana (2007) thus suggests that Britain\u2019s reputation as a world leading destination \nfor international students could thus be under threat, as 30 percent of international students do \nnot think the education they receive is worth the money. Thus the UK share in the international \nstudent market has fallen from 16 percent in 1998 to 11 percent in 2004, with Chinese students in \nparticular going to the US instead, owing to greater numbers of scholarships. Asthana (2007, 17) \nquotes a Kenyan female student who came to the UK to study: \n\u2018People are asking whether it is worth the risk, effort and hassle. In the past, if you \nhad the chance to study in the UK you grabbed it with both hands, but not any \nmore. Increasingly students are looking elsewhere.\u2019 \n \nWe give these examples not to argue for the weakening of colonial ties but instead to exemplify \nthe multiplication of imperial sites in and through colonialism. White settler colonies, populated \nby considerable numbers of white English migrants, in particular (but not only) become \nalternative centres from which the hegemony of English can be enacted. But colonialism has also \nspawned other centres with African students (from countries who were part of the old British \nEmpire) moving to India to study and so on. This multi-sitedness is itself a colonial heritage, \nalthough the UK claims and markets itself as the centre and originator of this legacy.  \n \nHowever, for fee paying students UK education is still, on the whole, cheaper than paying for \nprivate USHE, so for many self-funded students UKHE is a cheap option, not a privileged \n 24 \noption. Similarly, while the British Council may be seen as one arm of British academic \nimperialism which precisely locates itself in myriad countries in order to, among other things, \nrecruit students, other countries are not far behind.  The USA, for example, has far more \neducational franchises in the Third World than the UK. So colonial legacies are being rewritten \nand the authority of British HE must be understood alongside other factors shaping international \nstudent mobility. Changes are also occurring in some of the sending countries. For example, \nsince 1995 Malaysia has seen a rapid growth in private HE system including foreign branch \ncampuses, local private universities and recent upgrading of private collages to degree-granting \nuniversity colleges. Care must therefore be taken to recognise, but not to over determine British \ncolonialism in explanations of the patterns of international student recruitment. \n \nBesides, although the authority of colonialism and postcolonialism is continuously drawn upon \nin order to recruit students, it is precisely through the erasure of their presence that this authority \nis garnered. For example, geographers from around the world have come to the UK, completed \ntheir PhDs, contributed their ideas in conversations, their labour through experiments and their \nfinances through fees, which have helped shape what British geography is today. Many have \nstayed too, to contest the here\/there binary. Other international students have helped influence \nthe way British geography is taught, what is written about and helped shape academic research \nagendas, over time. In doing so, they have brought values, ideas, theories and languages from \nmany specific places, which intertwine with those here, to thoroughly muddy the waters of a \nsupposedly \u2018pure\u2019 British intellectual geographic tradition. But, forgetting these contributions has \nbecome central to defining and marketing British HE.  \n \n 25 \nSo too has there been erasure of the agency of international students in shaping their experiences, \nthe pedagogies and even marketing policies of HE. For example, as a female Ugandan student \ncommented on her experience of not being able to find space to contribute to a class discussion \nin an Australian university:  \n\u2018There was no respect to wait for somebody to speak\u2026.and I think the best way to \ndeal with this is also to push up myself\u2026.and then when I shared it with my other \ninternational students, they said they also experience the same thing\u2026..so we said \nwhat can we do now? So we said we should push it. Because I saw that everyone \nwas frustrated so we said it takes time, don\u2019t loose your confidence, go and push.\u2019 \n(Koehne, 2006, 253)   \n \nA further example, given by a female student at Massey University New Zealand, stated that: \n \u2018I think female postgraduate \u2026students who come out here are very strong \ncharacters. I think that they are very bright women. I think that they have fought \ntheir way to get here. I think they fit in extremely well\u2026they\u2019re very special \npeople, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be here.\u2019 \n(Scheyvens, 2005, 321)   \n \nThese statements suggest the struggle that lies behind having a voice and claiming agency as an \ninternational student, especially for women. The dialogues that necessarily underpin such \nrecognition seem to be even harder in the British context with its own particular history of race, \ngender and, even more importantly, class exclusions. Thus, recent research suggests that \ninternational students believe that universities in Australia (and south Africa, the US and \nNetherlands) are better than British ones at \u2018integrating\u2019 international students, developing \nemployment links and building friendships links and relationships with their \u2018home\u2019 colleagues \n(Hodges, 2007). As one second year male student from Hong Kong who was reading biology at a \nLondon university noted (quoted in Hodges, 2007, 7): \n\u2018Normally, during practicals, students of the same racial group sit together: the \nBritish sit with the British and the Indians sit with the Indians\u2026I think that British \nstudents and lecturers should be encouraged to talk to international students. \n 26 \nSometimes British tutors talk more to British students and ignore international \nstudents\u2026. But forcing integration is difficult. Ultimately, it is the cultural barrier \nthat makes students not talk to one another. Sometimes I find it hard to understand a \nBritish joke. I just don\u2019t find it funny. So, I think we should encourage mixing but \nwe shouldn\u2019t hope for too much.\u2019 \n \nAs Newman (2007b) reports UK students demonstrate \u2018passive xenophobia\u2019 towards \ninternational students, some students indicating that they were reluctant to include international \nstudents in group work as it might compromise the collective mark through lack of language \nability or of English pedagogy. Marking the category \u2018international students\u2019 as the group that \n\u2018lets the side down\u2019 highlights the common misrecognition that the UK, as the home of English, \nis also the place where the best English language tuition is available and to all. It is precisely \nthrough the erasure of the historical presence of English teaching around the world, its particular \nstrength in the colonies, and the importance of class divisions in defining who and how \npedagogic language is known, that such a sense of superiority is sustained.  \n \nSome UK students did report that they had benefited from the presence of international students \nand appreciated \u2018different perspectives\u2019, but in this case \u2018\u2026there was a sense in which many of \nthe students wanted to establish some form of personal credentials around internationalism and \nexoticism, potentially linked to the burgeoning backpacking culture\u2019 (Peacock and Harrison, \n2007, quoted in Newman, 2007b). Significant issues therefore remain in \u2018othering\u2019 international \nstudents as the \u2018problem group\u2019 (needing to integrate more, needing to improve language skills) \nand HE being heralded as the solution (by offering language services, or improved induction). \nThus Wright (1997, 107) argues:  \u2018Experiences of racism, culture-shock, poverty, inappropriate \nprovision, etc., have as much to do with British society as they do with individual overseas \nstudents\u2026.improving the experiences of overseas students is not just about a new policy-and-\n 27 \nresources initiative imposed from the top, but requires real and sustained dialogue between all \ngroups in the HE sector, as well as a recognition of the active steps overseas students have \nalways taken to help themselves.\u2019 \n \nThus, it is clear that international students, through their knowledge and economic resources, \nhave \u2018made\u2019 (and continues to make) both British HE, and British society more generally, what it \nis today. As Dominic Scott, chief executive of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, \nsaid:  \n\u2018It is refreshing to be reminded that international students are in fact strategically \nimportant to the UK. Their value is not just about income or internationalisation. As \none commentator put it, they are not just an exotic luxury, they are 'the element that \nenables the whole enterprise to survive'.\u2019(Quoted in Tysome, 2007) \n \nWe would therefore argue that UK HE, with its long history of international student attendance, \nis one, but only one, location of the continuous presence of the colonial and post-colonial subject \n\u2018within\u2019. Rather, it has spawned other centres of education with which it is now left to compete \nfor students. Yet both colonial legacies and postcolonial institutions are continuously being \ndrawn upon to garner the authority and desirability of UK qualifications. Making explicit how \nthese colonial histories and post-colonial imaginaries, as well as student agency itself, have \nshaped international students\u2019 presence in the UK moves us towards thinking more responsibly \nabout international students, from an expanded framework that shows how contemporary \nspatialities continue to be located within imperial structures of power. What is also clear is that \nmutuality exists between here and there, or rather that the \u2018here\u2019 \u2018there\u2019 formulation is itself \nunsettled through a more detailed look at the flows and the abruptions that have shaped \ninternational students\u2019 presence in the British academy. But it is only through recognising these \n 28 \nspatialities that any kind of responsibility for international students can be assumed. In fact, \nfollowing Massey (2004), one would argue that this mutuality is important for evoking \nresponsibility and for developing an engaged pedagogy. Responsibility is influenced by these \nongoing formative relations of care, where we have all invested in each other. We explore these \nissues in more depth below. \n \n5. Towards responsibility and care in an engaged postcolonial pedagogy  \nAs Jazeel and McFarlane (forthcoming) argue: \u2018a broad and varied project of producing a \npostcolonial geography necessitates a more considered engagement with the concepts of \nresponsibility and learning than currently exists in much of the extant literature connecting \ngeographies of knowledge production and postcoloniality.\u2019 In this paper we have specifically \ntaken up this challenge. However, we have located our discussion of pedagogy and \nresponsibility, not within the context of the classroom, but within the context of wider \ninternationalisation processes. So we have attempted to make visible the (often) silent presence \nof international students in HE in the UK, and produced a postcolonial analysis that encourages \nthinking responsibly about them. This is a shared responsibility (cf Young, 2003), which is \nactivated by the affective caring register, which aims to make visible the multiple global voices \nalready within the British geographic academy and is moved to respond to the claims made by \nthese voices, even, and especially, if these are related in modes different to the academics \n(varied) own voices. But equally this is a responsibility that brings into question the normalcy of \nhistorical and contemporary unjust geopolitical conditions which underpin academic imperialism \n(Ake, 1979) or indeed of how and where the national begins, given the history of \ninternationalism of which colonialism was an important part. \n 29 \n \nAs academics in the UK HEIs, we find that international students are becoming more and more \nimportant in making up the student body. Their state-fostered importance in the current academy \nhas meant that their presence can lead to direct material benefits to academics, as the ability to \nattract international students has increased the financial resources flowing into their institutions, \nto the country and also come to be part of the criteria for promotions in some institutions\nxiv\n. \nMoreover, and importantly, they have also become one part of the academic\u2019s emotional and \nintellectual landscape. \n \nAt the same time it is crucial to note that, in the case of UK HE, the academic institutions to \nwhich international students are now integral are increasingly embedded within (not some \npristine space outside of) the global neo-liberal agenda. This agenda is acute in building upon \nprevious repertoires of global inequality and individuals embedded within UK HEIs are actively \nreproducing such inequalities. Thus as Berg (2006) articulates, academics are in a paradoxical \nposition, in which they often simultaneously contest and reinforce neo-liberal practices. This is \nso very clearly the case with respect to international students (for example, where academics \nwho routinely lecture about the inequities of the global trade system, may at the same time be \nmaking visits to India or Nigeria to recruit international students) but these paradoxes have \nreceived little critical attention, precisely \u2018because such embedding, or \u2018roll out\u2019 neo-liberalism, \nhas been intimately tied up with the everyday practices of academics\u2019 (Berg, 2006, 766). It really \nis time that these everyday practices of inequality, and the multiple paradoxical position that \nacademic geographers play within these structures of academic imperialism, are made visible. \nCalls to care and to be responsible must be set within this context. \n 30 \n \nHowever, all this is occurring within the context of other wider changes within the academy. As \nBritish academics feeling the pinch of a neo-liberal system, in which work burdens and \nescalating administration bear down on working lives, the ability to work towards an engaged \npedagogy is also increasingly becoming circumscribed. Howitt (2000, 317) summarises a \nnumber of difficulties currently facing many geographers in Western universities: \u2018University \nteachers are under considerable pressure. Concerns about changing patterns of government \nfunding, increased class sizes, deteriorating teaching facilities in many institutions, market \nintrusions into curriculum processes, industrial organisation of the labour processes of teaching, \nreduced academic autonomy and increased administrative demands on teachers are repeated in \nmany Higher Education institutions\u2019 (quoted by Scheyvens, 2003, 315).  \n \nIt is in this context that we want to conclude by asking what an engaged pedagogy, informed by \na \u2018care-full\u2019 recognition of postcolonial interaction might look like.  What forms, practices and \ndiscourses would be prevalent in such an engaged pedagogy? Whilst balking against a simple \n\u2018how to do it\u2019 list, we draw on the work of others to suggest that an engaged pedagogy might \ninclude some of the following features. First, a key point is that an engaged pedagogy contests \nthe centre from which care and responsibility can be talked about and experienced. As Fisher and \nTronto (1990) have outlined, practices of care may involve attentiveness (noticing students\u2019 care \nneeds), responsibility, competence (as an academic) and responsiveness (which involves an \nawareness of the different positionings and vulnerabilities of the teacher and the taught). This \nframework helps to unsettle the binaries between taught and teacher in fundamental ways and \ntherefore encourages introspection over the liminalities of the boundaries between teacher and \n 31 \ntaught, without giving up the responsibilities of either category. This necessarily also involves a \nreflection of the processes of subjectivation that accompany student recruitment, not only in the \nconstitution of the category international students, but also home students (and the erasures in its \nconstitution). It involves consideration of how the categories of teacher and student are being \naffirmed, but also how can they be challenged, within every moment of interaction both within \nand outside the classroom. It also leads to questions about the absence of rhetoric about \ninternational teachers in the constitution of debates around international students. At what point \ndo international students who become teachers become part of the national fabric, and how are \nthey called upon to act on behalf of a nation? \n \nSecondly, an engaged pedagogy would necessarily involve genuine dialogue, one that must \ncontest the hegemonic discourse of western \u2018best practice\u2019 and at minimum take responsibility to \ncare and to imagine everyday academic practices from a multitude of different perspectives and \ncentres. To do this, frameworks of understanding will have to shift to recognise that many \nrealities and knowledges exist and are valuable.  For example, Robinson (2003) suggests some \nsteps that might be taken to recognise the many postcolonial publics that have shaped the \ndiscipline of Geography. Thus she argues for the need to acknowledge the locatedness of \ntheories, to demarginalise development geography, to engage with regional scholarship, and to \ntransform the conditions of production and circulation of knowledge that now lie before many \nscholars in other countries. The hegemony of Anglo-American geographies and the manoeuvres \nof the publishing industry have left great distance therefore between what is taught and who is \nteaching. Hence textbook authors often have no \u2018live\u2019 presence in the lives of many international \nstudents. Coming face-to-face with authors can be a moment of awe but it can also help students \n 32 \nto recognise their own agency within the discipline. Facilitating this agency through modes of \nteaching, and not just content of teaching, and building up a sense of entitlements may be one \npart of engaged pedagogy. Similarly, Gregory (2005,186-8) suggests a range of \u2018counter \ngeographies\u2019 that can work to emphasise postcolonial connection, counteracting colonial and \nneo-colonial distancing strategies: contextual geographies that reveal the material realities of \nother people\u2019s lives; contrapuntal geographies that highlight global connections and \nrelationships; cosmopolitan geographies that emphasise commonalities; and collaborative \ngeographies in which partnerships are formed between academics in different countries. What \nnew forms of subject formation can be enabled through such partnerships and genuine dialogue \u2013 \nwhat interpretive repertoires may be opened up which focus less on the sticky place-based \nidentifications of a national order and instead move towards a recognition of  education as a \nuniversal good that is already set within terms of mobility.. \n \nThirdly, we would argue that this pedagogical engagement needs to manifest itself well beyond \nteaching practice and into everyday practices of caring and responsiveness beyond the \nclassroom, to understand how historically produced political structures, institutional cultures and \npolicies  shape international student experiences and recruitment. An engaged pedagogy would \ntherefore be mindful of the broader discourses, power hierarchies, and social relations that frame \ninternational students\u2019 presence in the UK.  As a result it is important that the responsibility to \ncare is not simply \u2018privatised\u2019 to the level of the individual academic and their classroom \npedagogic strategies. Instead, it must also be seen as a broader \u2018social\u2019 response: political \nstructures, institutional cultures and policies, and the people that police these, must be challenged \nto care, to be politicised to be responsible for the inequitable implications of their regulatory and \n 33 \nmarketing policies. So whilst we agree with Jazeel and McFarlane (forthcoming) that as \nindividuals academics are responsible to students especially (but not only) in their teaching \npractices, we also urge that administrators, vice chancellors, marketing managers and civil \nservants (through government and university institutions, policies and structures) be challenged \nto be responsible. We would urge that all those involved in UK HEIs become familiar with, and \nreflect upon, the conditions of overseas recruitment and to reflect on how \u2018international\u2019 students \nare discursively framed within recruitment debates, contextualising their own role in how such \nstudents came to be here in the first place. And that self-introspection may force consideration of \nthe costs in the forms of subjectivation that are undergone in practices of recruitment and \ndisciplining of international students. For example, how are we being produced as academic \nteachers, but also what forms of power are we being subjected to? \n \nFourthly, an engaged pedagogy cannot be conceived a priori, as it is necessarily deeply \ncontextual and place specific. Here we are not simply talking about institutional and national \ncontext, but the varying context, hierarchies and sometimes competition between students (who \noccupy varying positions in terms of class positions, material resources, funding opportunities, \nlanguage abilities, familial support in Britain, opportunities to work, age based hierarchies etc) \nand the varying context of academics (sexuality, class, race, gender and age power hierarchies, \ndifferential insertion into institutional structures, varying non-work commitments etc). Here we \nare not suggesting an endless (longing) search for difference but rather an acceptance of the \npossibility of both commonalities and differences at all times.  \n \n 34 \nFifthly, however, we must be mindful of the quandaries raised in an attempt to materialise an \nengaged pedagogy because of the complexities involved. This means that an engaged pedagogy \nis probably risky too (in some places and some times and for some people) because the \ninstability of the nature of responsibility and care means that even if in constant dialogue, we \nmight get it wrong at times too. And this process will therefore involve deep (everyday) \nemotional investments of joy sacrifice and commitment. Furthermore, academic ability to be \nresponsible and to care may also be circumscribed by lives well beyond the academy: by family \ncommitments, by financial debts, by community work- all of which may squeeze time and \nemotional strength and limit the ability to care. Besides, just as for students, for academics too, \ntemporalities from the past may set the scenes of engagement with international students- \nspecific personal family histories (as active colonisers, as colonisers and colonized who resisted \nthose power relations, as the colonized population compliant with colonialism, as citizens \nsimultaneously experiencing colonization and colonized etc) may well influence commitment to \nthe international student agenda. All these factors suggest that sometimes taking a responsible \nposition is actually a recognition of the limitations of one\u2019s ability to care, for example, by \nrefusing to take (yet another) international postgraduate student in order to \u2018bolster\u2019 recruitment \ntargets. In other situations, taking responsibility may involve refusing to collude with line \nmanagers, marketing committees and the like, who actively recruit students without taking the \npedagogic responsibilities entailed by taking recruitment seriously. It may involve recognising \nand critiquing the role of UKHEIs in creating the underdevelopment of individuals and families \nin poorer countries who are making horrendous financial sacrifices (for generations) to enable a \nfamily member to experience a (not-so) British education. This suggests that there are always \nlimits to care and responsibility and that these are always in negotiation, brokered by institutional \n 35 \nlocations, inter-personal power relations, personalised ethics. But it also suggests that there is \nsome ability to overcome institutional framings to establish relations beyond that, to affect and \ndestabilize specified local forces at particular points in time\nxv\n.  \n \nTo conclude, in this paper we have viewed engaged pedagogy from a postcolonial frame. This \nhas involved both rethinking and unsettling the spatialities involved in international student \nmobility and in relocating the \u2018voice\u2019 through which such concerns are articulated. As such, we \nhave firstly argued that postcolonialism demands that engaged pedagogy is viewed as (mostly) a \ncomplex form of interdependence and mutuality which challenges the idea of proximate and \ndistant relations and questions the centre from which international students are analysed. \nSecondly, we have shown that the \u2018centre\u2019 of the British academy is not solid, but is (and has \nalways been) unstable, fractured and contested, brimming with multitudinous claims. It is our \nresponsibility to hear and act upon these claims and to make space for the highly differentiated \nforms of care and responsibility arising from the viewpoint of international students themselves. \nThese are fundamental issues, which refute tendencies to locate postcoloniality \u2018elsewhere\u2019 but \nrather recognises the interdependence and mutuality that shapes the postcolonial present. Lines \nof caring and responsibility are therefore unclear and not wholly pre-decided but do have traces \nfrom the past and implications for the future. Thus the example of international students bring \nforth complex spatialities of responsibility which suggests that for academic geographers \nworking in Britain, responsibility must be seen as reflexive, as one that already recognises that \npostcoloniality alters internationalisation in the UK HE system and changes the frame of who \ncan make claims to being part of British geography. It is our responsibility to acknowledge that \npresence, to recognise the inability to make visible that presence as loss and to respond to the \n 36 \nclaims that arise from this presence. There are no easy answers but one thing that is clear is that \npostcolonial responsibility and care fold up, and reopen, space in complicated ways.  \n 37 \nReferences  \nAbiri, E. 2000.

However, we are \nequally clear that it is a problematic term, for it signals an \u2018othering\u2019, for what may be seen to be \ninternational from a British perspective may not be viewed as such from a different geopolitical \ncentre. Moreover, in many situations there is no clear distinction between \u2018international\u2019 and \n\u2018local\u2019 students. At other times, this distinction becomes much clearer as the duration of \nmovement and the shifting nature of the space of circulation (as both free movement within the \nEuropean Union and increasing differentiation between different nations within the United \nKingdom), alter who is international, and when. More work is needed as to what forms this \ninternationalisation takes in different spaces and places for different students. \n \nii\n This mobility of international students is multi-sited. Some students travel along established \ncolonial routes in postcolonial contexts, as for example from Cape Verde to Portugal or India to \nthe UK (Khadria, 2001). Others move to geographically proximate locations, such as students in \nLesotho moving to South Africa (Mashinini and Mashinini, 2003) and from mainland China to \nHong Kong and Macau (Li and Bray, 2007), or to locations that have become lodestars for \ngeneralised student mobility (such as the US). More complex south-south student migration can \nalso be seen, such as that of African students to India (Bhardwaj, 1997; Ndoleriire, 2003).  \n \niii\n Based on the most recent UK HESA statistics available. \n \niv\n It is assumed that the main audience of this paper is academic geographers. However, they are \nclearly not a homogenous group, with a myriad of positions with respect to internationals \nstudents. In fact, the boundary between academic and international student is itself labile, as this \npaper argues.  \n \nv\n We refer to the UK Higher Education system in this paper. We recognise that there are many \nlimitations with this scale of analysis (see below) but this is the only scale for which data are \navailable, thus \u2018forcing\u2019 this particular scalar approach. It would, for example, probably be \nmore accurate to refer to the English Higher Education system, as the historical relations \nshaping student mobility to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and other parts of the world, \nare very different to those of England. Moreover, the Higher Educations systems in these \nnations are also different and will produce different relationships with international students. \nFor example, the UKCOSA (2004) survey on International Students in UK Universities and \nColleges specifically highlighted variations in the data for Scotland, Wales and England in \ndemographics, overall satisfaction levels, finances, accommodation, social integration and \nemployment. It is therefore a short-coming to conflate England with Britain or the UK (see \nhttp:\/\/www.ukcosa.org.uk\/survey\/UKregions.doc). Also, immigration regimes vary in these \ndifferent nations, with Scotland, for example, offering a different set of immigration \nregulations for those completing degrees from their universities, making Scotland more \nattractive to some international students (see \u2018Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland Scheme\u2019 \nhttp:\/\/www.ukcosa.org.uk\/images\/workafter.pdf, accessed July 2007). Similarly, we talk about \nBritish Geography as this is specific from, for example, Irish Geography.  \n \n 51 \n                                                                                                                                                 \nvi\n However, it is important to state here that these data are based upon one particular category of \ninternational students, i.e. those who come to the UK and have not been eligible for home-\nstudent fees. This is a diverse body which includes the children of migrants who have been here \nfor up to five years but who have no settled status and are therefore not eligible for home student \nfees. It also includes those who came to the UK for schooling and continued into Higher \nEducation but are not eligible for home-student fees because they have not lived in the country \nfor purposes other than education for three years. Finally, it also includes UK citizens who have \nbeen outside the EEA for the past three years and are primarily in education. On the other hand, \nmigrants who have been in the UK for three years for purposes other than education may classify \nfor fee purposes as home students, as do EEA students. So the category of international students \nincludes a range of different students with different immigration statuses. And this means that \nthey have different rights of further stay, of employment and rights to housing during the \n\u2018writing up period\u2019 of a research postgraduate course etc. It also suggests that the boundaries of \nthe category international are porous, change with time and extend far beyond any simple    \nracial or national boundary. \nvii\n Within geography, the situation is as follows. In 2005\/6, the number of EU students as a \nproportion of the total HE international students in Social and Human Geography was 3 percent, \ncompared to 5 percent for non-EU students. For Geography and Environmental Science, the \ncontribution of EU students was 7 percent compared to 16 percent non-EU (adapted from \nhttp:\/\/www.hesa.ac.uk\/holisdocs\/pubinfo\/student\/subject0506.xls).  \nviii\n For example, a recent report by the British Council (in association with Universities UK and \nIDP Education Australia) entitled \u2018Vision 2020: Forecasting international student mobility - a \nUK perspective\u2019 presented a forecast concerning the demand for Higher Education places \nthroughout the world by international students. The findings were based on detailed analysis of \ndemand for places in the English speaking destination countries from 144 countries. Some key \nforecasts included: global demand for international student places in English speaking \ndestination countries was likely to increase from the current 1 million to 2.6 million by 2020; \nEast and South Asia would account for the majority of the new demand, with China and India \nbeing the largest prospective markets; demand from the EU Accession States is likely to treble \nby 2010. By 2010 it was therefore suggested that there could be more international postgraduate \nthan undergraduate students in the UK (British Council, 2004). According to Leonard et al \n(2003), this expansion is likely to spawn a new range of new sites and modes of learning (a \nplethora of off-shore, on-line, franchised courses from public and private sector providers), new \nmodes of partnership between universities, and potentially new modes of knowledge production \n(involving more interactive, user-oriented processes in groups outside or in collaboration with \nuniversities) (see also Jarvis, 2000). Associated with these recruitment drives there have been \nmore sophisticated marketing, publicity and new contractual agreements, and attempts to \nharmonise qualifications across national boundaries, such as the Bologna declaration which has \nfocused on qualifications frameworks, credit transfer and ratings across Europe (Leonard et al, \n2003). \n \nix\n The large literature in this field means that this review cannot be comprehensive or complete. \nHowever it highlights some of the key issues pertaining to international students within the \n 52 \n                                                                                                                                                 \ncontext of education. There is also a large literature which uses international students as a cohort \nto explore themes such as social and cultural change but we are not reviewing this here (see for \ninstance, Mani, 2003). \n \nx\n Khadria (2001) also assigns some of the blame for this backflow from the Global South to the \nNorth to the lack of effective policies in the former countries. Thus India has increased the \npermissible ceiling of what people can remit out of the country from 25,000 to 50,000 USD. \n \nxi\n According to UKCOSA (2004), international student experiences of UK Higher Education \nInstitutions were, on the whole, positive. Key findings indicated that 91% of undergraduates and \n85% of postgraduates were satisfied or very satisfied with their course of study; 70% of \nrespondents had used their college or university's advice service; nearly 80% of students attended \nan induction or orientation session; three quarters of students were offered institution-managed \nhousing at the start of their stay and 89% of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with \ntheir stay in the UK. The most commonly listed benefits included their academic experience, \nimproving their English, becoming more independent and meeting people from all over the \nworld.  The report also recognised that there is scope for the UK to improve its welcome to \ninternational students. In particular, improving access to banking facilities for international \nstudents, removing barriers to employment for international students and ensuring immigration \nservices for international students are fair, transparent and efficient. The report also advised \ninstitutions of the need to improve aspects of the information they provide to students before \nthey arrive in the UK. \n \nxii\n Also what counts as disciplinary\/academic knowledge has itself been shaped through colonial \nencounters (see Tuhiwai-Smith, 2003), so not only is how UK Higher Education marketed \nimportant, but also what is marketed). \n \nxiii\n Sen (2003) similarly gives an account of the relationship between empire, education and the \n\u2018production\u2019 of elite children in colonial India.  \n \nxiv\n The response of geography academics towards the recruitment of international students is as \ncomplex and multifaceted as are our relationships with them. Some of us refuse to take \ninternational students on, others blithely accept these students, even when they can not adequate \nsupervise or teach them, whilst others actively recruit international students to either specifically \nbolster the university regime or to specifically challenge the hegemony of Anglo-American \ngeography.  So there is not one singular simple response to our international students: \ncontestation, collusion and collaboration are all involved in our relationships with them, often \nsimultaneously. \n \nxv\n For example, Linda Tuhiwai Smith (1999) usefully works through this recognition of both the \npotential and limits of academics in relation to others, in the context of non-indigenous \nresearchers\u2019 responsibilities towards Maori researchers. \n \n"}
