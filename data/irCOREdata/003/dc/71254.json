Until now, it has been assumed that the \nprimary short-term controls on isoprene emission are photosynthetically active \nradiation and temperature. Here we show for the first time that isoprene emissions \nfrom a tropical tree (oil palm, Elaeis guineensis) are under strong circadian control \nand that the circadian clock is potentially able to gate light induced isoprene \nemissions. These rhythms are robustly temperature compensated with isoprene \nemissions still under circadian control at 38 \u00baC. This is well beyond the \nacknowledged temperature range of all previously described circadian phenomena \nin plants. Furthermore, rhythmic expression of LHY\/CCA1, a genetic component of \nthe central clock in Arabidopsis thaliana, is still maintained at these elevated \ntemperatures in oil palm. Maintenance of the CCA1\/LHY-TOC1 molecular \noscillator at these temperatures in oil palm allows for the possibility that this \nsystem is involved in the control of isoprene emission rhythms. This study \ncontradicts the accepted theory that isoprene emissions are primarily light \ninduced. \n Keywords: Isoprene, oil palm, diurnal variability, circadian clock, circadian gating. \nAbbreviations: IE (isoprene emission rate); IE1000\/30 (isoprene emission rate at PAR of \n1000 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 and 30 \u00baC leaf temperature); LL (constant light). \n \n \n4 \n 4 \nIntroduction \nEmissions of the volatile organic compound isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene; \nC5H8) from the biosphere affect the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere (Shallcross \nand Monks, 2000) and hence have the potential to modify regional ozone pollution \n(Pierce et al., 1998), lead to secondary aerosol formation (Claeys et al., 2004) and \nindirectly control the lifetime of the greenhouse gas methane (Poisson et al., 2000). \nIsoprene is synthesized in the chloroplast, mainly from recently assimilated carbon \n(Karl et al., 2002), and although synthesis is loosely coupled to photosynthetic \nprocesses through substrate availability and requirements for adenosine triphosphate, its \nemission may become uncoupled from photosynthesis, particularly at elevated \ntemperatures (Harley et al., 1999). On time scales of minutes to hours, the primary \ncontrols that are known to affect isoprene emission rate (IE) are photosynthetically \nactive radiation (PAR) and leaf temperature (Harley et al., 1999), which regulate \nsubstrate availability and enzyme kinetics (Sharkey et al., 2001). Isoprene is emitted \nthrough stomata but changes in stomatal aperture have negligible effects on its emission \ndue to its high volatility and low solubility in water (Niinemets and Reichstein, 2003a). \nIn the longer term, carbon dioxide concentration (Possell et al., 2004; Possell et al., \n2005), leaf phenology (Kuzma and Fall, 1993), leaf nitrogen content (Harley et al., \n1994; Rosenstiel et al., 2004), and environmental stresses such as soil water potential \n(Pegoraro et al., 2004) and herbivory (Funk et al., 1999) also affect the magnitude of IE. \nTo compile emission inventories for this important compound, branch and leaf \nenclosure techniques are commonly employed to determine the isoprene emission rate \nfor individual plant species at 1000 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 (PAR) and 30 \u00baC leaf temperature. \nHere we define this parameter as IE1000\/30. An estimate of IE at ambient PAR and \n5 \n 5 \ntemperature throughout the day for each species is obtained by scaling IE1000\/30 using \nlight and temperature correction factors (Guenther et al., 1995). Species composition \nand density are then used to estimate a regional average emission flux. However, there \nis high variability in IE1000\/30 measurements with considerable day to day, seasonal and \ninter- and intra-species variability (e.g. http:\/\/www.acd.ucar.edu:8080\/voc\/vocIndex.jsp; \nhttp:\/\/www.es.lancs.ac.uk\/cnhgroup\/iso-emissions.pdf.). Significant diurnal variability \nin the magnitude of IE1000\/30 for several tree species has also been reported. Isoprene \nemission rates from cottonwood and oak, standardized to IE1000\/30, were observed to be \nsignificantly higher in the afternoon than in the morning (Funk et al., 2003). Yet in the \nsame study no variability in IE1000\/30 for eucalyptus was observed. In other studies, \nIE1000\/30 for oak has been shown to increase over a day by as much as 50 %; this \nincrease could be predicted using changes in weather conditions over the previous 24 \nhours (Sharkey et al., 1999; Geron et al., 2000). However, some of the variability in \nIE1000\/30 cannot be explained by present understanding of the effects of short-term \nenvironmental and biological controls on isoprene synthesis. As well as changes in \nIE1000\/30 over the course of a day, significant changes in the concentration of the \nisoprene precursor, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), have been observed (Geron et \nal., 2000; Wolfertz et al., 2003; Rosenstiel et al., 2004) but without a link being made to \npossible circadian control. \nA wide range of fundamental processes in plant biology are optimized and \ncoordinated each day due to regulation by an endogenous circadian clock. Examples \ninclude leaf movements, hypocotyl elongation, gene transcript and protein abundance \nrhythms and the photoperiodic control of flowering time (McClung, 2001). A number of \nthe genes that constitute the molecular components of the positive-negative \n6 \n 6 \nautoregulatory feedback loops that comprise the plant circadian clock have been \nidentified in Arabidopsis thaliana. CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and \nLATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and the pseudo-response \nregulator\/CONSTANS-domain protein TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1) form \nat least one of the interlocking loops at the core of the plant clock (Alabadi et al., 2001). \nCCA1 and LHY transcript abundance is under circadian control and peaks at dawn \n(Schaffer et al., 1998; Wang and Tobin, 1998). Orthologous clock genes have been \ncharacterised in plant species as diverse as rice (Izawa et al., 2003), common ice plant \n(Mesembryanthemum crystallinum) (Boxall et al., 2005), beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) \n(Kaldis et al., 2003) and chestnut (Castanea sativa) (Ramos et al., 2005) suggesting that \nthe genetic components of the clock are broadly conserved in higher plants. In \nArabidopsis, all known clock-controlled processes have been shown to be ultimately \nresponding to the central CCA1\/LHY-TOC1 oscillator including gas exchange, leaf \nmovements, gene expression rhythms and flowering time (Dodd et al., 2005). The \nCCA1 and LHY proteins belong to the Myb family of transcription factors (Schaffer et \nal., 1998; Wang and Tobin, 1998) and thus act at the transcriptional level to control \ngene expression. \nHere we report that isoprene emission from the fronds of oil palm trees are under \nthe control of a circadian clock. Circadian rhythms of isoprene emission persist for \nseveral days at constant light and temperature, are robust and temperature compensated \nbetween 25 \u00baC and 38 \u00baC and are gated in a circadian fashion. Using an oil palm \nCCA1\/LHY orthologue as a marker, we establish that the molecular clock also operates \nin oil palm trees up to 38 \u00baC and thus that this clock is potentially capable of \ncoordinating isoprene emission rhythms. \n7 \n 7 \n \nResults \nIsoprene emission in oil palm is under circadian control \nAs noted above, diurnal variability in IE standardised to IE1000\/30 has been \nobserved previously (Sharkey et al., 1999; Geron et al., 2000; Funk et al., 2003).  We \nhave confirmed this using field measurements of IE1000\/30 from oil palm growing on a \nplantation in Malaysia, which showed a strong diurnal trend (Fig 1a). This trend was \nalso observed in laboratory grown plants under controlled conditions (Figure 1b). To \ndetermine whether this short-term variability in IE1000\/30 is caused by circadian \nregulation, we monitored IE1000\/30 from a frondlet under constant illumination (LL) for \n70 h at 1000 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 and constant 30 oC leaf temperature. If isoprene synthesis is \nunder circadian control, we would expect to observe free running rhythms in IE1000\/30 \nover a period of several days. The frondlet was illuminated from dark at 06:00 (normal \n\u2018lights on\u2019).  IE1000\/30 increased for 4 h, reaching a maximum (IEmax) of ~40 nmol C m-2 \ns-1, before declining over the rest of the day (Figure 2a). IE1000\/30 fell during subjective \nnight (i.e. when the frondlet is not normally illuminated) to approximately 10% of IEmax \nbefore rising again the following subjective morning. Over the following 48 h, \noscillations in IE1000\/30 continued but with a dampening of IEmax.  The period of \noscillation in this free running cycle was 23.1 h. The persistence of rhythms in the \nabsence of a dark-light cycle or other exogenous signals clearly indicates that isoprene \nsynthesis is regulated by an internal biological clock.  \nTo investigate the effect of different leaf temperatures on these free running \nrhythms in IE, we repeated the experiment at leaf temperatures of 25 \u00baC (IE1000\/25) and \n38 \u00baC (IE1000\/38) (Figure 2b and 2c respectively). At these temperatures, isoprene \n8 \n 8 \nemissions oscillated over several days with the magnitude and amplitude of the \noscillations dependent on leaf temperature and correlated positively with these \nparameters. The increase in absolute emission rates with increasing temperature is \nconsistent with present understanding of the effects of temperature on isoprene synthase \nactivity (Sharkey et al., 2001). As well as IE increasing with temperature, Figures 2a-c \nshow that the oscillations in IE become more robust at elevated temperatures when the \ncentral components of the plant circadian clock are believed to become arrhythmic. The \nperiod of the IE rhythm was 25.5 h at 25 \u02daC and 21.4 h at 38 \u02daC, revealing that the \nrhythm shows significant temperature compensation. The robust circadian rhythm in IE \nat all three temperatures is not reflected in assimilation rates (A); no circadian rhythm in \nA was observed (Figure 2d-f). This suggests a total uncoupling of IE from \nphotosynthesis. Rhythmicity was observed in stomatal conductance (gs) (Fig 2d-f) but \nthe period length differed to that of IE such that the two parameters were not in phase \nwith one another (see Table 1). These results confirm previous findings which have \nshown that IE is independent of gs (Fall, 1999; Niinemets and Reichstein, 2003a; \n2003b). \n \n \nTable 1.

(a) Field measurements of IE1000\/30 from oil palm taken in an oil palm \nplantation in Sabah, Malaysia.  PAR and temperature were held constant at 1000 \u00b5mol \nm-2 s-1 and 30 \u00baC from 10:00 to 16:00 hours. (b) IE1000\/30 measured in the laboratory. \nPAR and temperature were held constant at 1000 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 and 30 \u00baC from 10:00 to \n18:00 hours. \n \n \n \n10 \n 10 \nTo eliminate the possibility of cross-talk signalling between neighbouring cells \noutside the gas exchange cuvette, which were at a different temperature to the measured \ncells inside the cuvette, whole frond measurements of IE were made using excised \nfronds, with the whole frond kept at a constant temperature. Isoprene emissions from \nthese fronds were measured at leaf temperatures of 25 and 38 \u00baC at light intensity of 120 \n\u00b5mol m-2 s-1 (IE120\/25 and IE120\/38; Figures 2g and h respectively). At 25 \u00baC (Figure 2g), \nwhole frond isoprene IE120\/25 oscillated with a similar period to that seen in the leaf \ncuvette (Figure 2b). At 38 \u00baC (Figure 2h), the periodicity in IE120\/38 was seen for 48 h, \nafter which wilting of the excised frond occurred and IE became arrhythmic. From these \nwhole frond measurements at both 25 \u00baC and 38 \u00baC we conclude that no cross-talk \nsignalling occurred between neighbouring cells during the cuvette experiments.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n 11 \n \n \nFigure 2.

Full frond IE measured in LL (120 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1) at \n25 \u00baC and 38 \u00baC are also shown in (g) and (h) respectively. Note: in panel b, IE values \nhave been multiplied by 10. \n \n \n \n \n12 \n 12 \nThe oil palm molecular clock maintains function at high temperatures \nThe robust circadian rhythm of isoprene emissions at 38 \u02daC (Figs. 2c and 2h) \nindicate that a circadian clock must be operating in oil palm at a significantly higher \ntemperature than any previously recorded plant circadian rhythm. For example, the \ncircadian rhythm of CO2 fixation in the tropical CAM species Kalancho\u00eb \ndaigremontiana becomes arrhythmic above 32 \u02daC, even in plants that were pre-adapted \nto a daytime temperature of 34 \u02daC for one month prior to analysis (Grams et al., 1995). \nIt was therefore important to examine the operation of the molecular clock in oil palm at \n38 \u02daC to determine whether the molecular oscillator was operating and, therefore, \ncapable of controlling the observed IE rhythm. We identified an oil palm expressed \nsequence tag (EST), which we called EgCCA1\/LHY, which is an orthologue of the \nArabidopsis central clock components CCA1 and LHY (see Materials and Methods). We \ncollected frondlet samples every six hours from excised oil palm fronds maintained in \nLL at both 25 \u02daC and 38 \u02daC using a whole-frond chamber. We isolated RNA from each \nfrondlet sample and used a real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique to \nexamine changes in the steady-state transcript abundance of EgCCA1\/LHY (Fig. 3). This \nanalysis revealed robust rhythms in EgCCA1\/LHY transcript abundance at both 25 \u02daC \nand 38 \u02daC, supporting the hypothesis that IE could be controlled by the CCA1\/LHY-\nTOC1 central molecular clock. It is noteworthy that the period of the EgCCA1\/LHY \nrhythm at 38 \u02daC is significantly shorter than the rhythm at 25 \u02daC (Fig. 3); this correlates \nwell with the shortening of the period of the IE rhythm at 38 \u02daC relative to 25 \u02daC (Figs \n2a-c). \n \n13 \n 13 \n         \n          \nFigure 3.  Steady state changes in mRNA transcript abundance of EgCCA1\/LHY at leaf \ntemperatures of 25 \u00baC (open circles) and 38 \u00baC (closed circles) under constant \nillumination.  \n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n 14 \nIsoprene emissions are circadian-gated \nCircadian clock outputs are often gated such that they can only be activated at a \nspecific phase in the 24 h cycle. For example, the circadian rhythm of nocturnal CO2 \nfixation in the Crassulacean acid metabolism species Kalancho\u00eb fedtschenkoi is gated in \nresponse to temperature (Hartwell et al., 2002). When the temperature was reduced \nfrom the non-permissive 30 \u02daC to the permissive 15 \u02daC during the subjective light \nperiod, no CO2 fixation was observed in this species, but when the temperature was \nreduced to 15 \u02daC during the subjective dark period, CO2 fixation was initiated. IE has \npreviously been assumed to respond directly to light, with zero emission in the dark, i.e. \nemissions will only occur if the frondlet is illuminated. However, if the induction of \nisoprene is gated by the circadian clock, we would predict that emissions should only \noccur when a frondlet is illuminated during the subjective light period. Illumination of a \nfrondlet at the beginning of the subjective dark period should not give rise to isoprene \nemissions until the subsequent subjective light period. \nWe investigated this by keeping two leaves in the dark at the end of subjective \nday; one for 24 h, the other for 36 h. The frondlet kept in the dark for 24 h was \nilluminated with 1000 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 at 18:00, at the onset of subjective dark, at a \nconstant leaf temperature of 30 oC. Following illumination, IE1000\/30 was essentially zero \nuntil the start of the next subjective day, at which time it increased significantly (Figure \n4: black line). This demonstrates an uncoupling of IE from the light stimulus, and is in \ncontrast to all previous assumptions about the light dependency of IE. Continued \nillumination of the frondlet, for a further 24 h, resulted in diurnal oscillations in IE1000\/30 \nwith a period ~24 h. During the second subjective night, IE1000\/30 did not fall to zero but \ndecreased to approximately 20% of the preceding IEmax before increasing during the \n15 \n 15 \nfollowing subjective day. The frondlet that was kept in the dark for 36 h (Figure 4: open \ncircles) was illuminated at the start of subjective day. IE1000\/30 was zero for the first hour \nafter the frondlet was illuminated and then increased significantly, reaching IEmax at \n09:40 before starting to decline. This circadian gating of isoprene emission is similar to \nthe gating described for the acute induction of the chlorophyll A\/B binding protein \n(CAB) by light in Arabidopsis thaliana (Millar and Kay, 1996). Figure 4 also shows \nthat the time of day that IEmax was achieved for the frondlet illuminated at 18:00 (black \nline) was delayed by 9 h when compared to the frondlet illuminated at 06:00 (open \ncircles). This suggests there was a shift in phase of the circadian rhythm due to the \nfrondlet being illuminated at the beginning of a subjective dark period, i.e. 12 h out of \nphase with the prior light entrainment of the frondlet. These results demonstrate that the \nisoprene emissions are circadian-gated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n 16 \n \n \n                           \nFigure 4.

Note that when a frondlet was kept in the dark for 24 h and illuminated at \nthe start of subjective day, initiation of IE was delayed by 12 h (black line).  When a \nfrondlet kept in the dark for 36 h was illuminated at the start of subjective day (open \ncircles) no delay in the onset of isoprene emission was observed.  Comparison of \nemission rates between the two leaves shows that illuminating the frondlet at the start of \nsubjective night resulted in a shift of phase of ~9 h. \n \n \n17 \n 17 \nDiurnal variability in IE at low light intensities \nTo determine the effect of different light intensities on the observed diurnal \nvariability in IE, we measured IE at PAR of 100, 200 and 300 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 on \nsuccessive days at a constant leaf temperature (30 \u00baC). For each light treatment IEmax \noccurred 2-3 hours after illumination (Figure 5). Following IEmax there was a steady \ndecline in IE during the afternoon. This is in contrast to the square wave function \npreviously assumed, in which IE rapidly stabilises at a given value, irrespective of the \ntime of day, as long as PAR and temperature remain constant.  However, the magnitude \nof IEmax was PAR dependent, which is consistent with previous reports (Guenther et al., \n1993; Lerdau and Gray, 2003). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n 18 \n \n               \nFigure 5.  Diurnal variability in isoprene emission rates (IE) at a constant leaf \ntemperature of 30 \u02daC and PAR of 100 (closed circles), 200 (open circles) and 300 \n(crosses) \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 respectively. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n 19 \nDiscussion \nDespite considerable efforts to elucidate the physiological role of isoprene, its \nbiological function still remains unclear. Several hypotheses have been proposed to \nexplain its production by plants, including: a role as a mechanism to alleviate oxidative \nstress (Loreto et al., 2001; Affek and Yakir, 2002); a protectant of photosynthetic \napparatus against thermal damage (Sharkey and Yeh, 2001); or as a mechanism to \nprotect against excessive light (Penuelas and Munne-Bosch, 2005). Therefore, a \ncircadian mechanism that allows plants to adjust to the diurnal variability of these \ndifferent stresses and more efficiently protect the photosynthetic apparatus in high light \nand temperature environments would help to increase productivity and would be of \nevolutionary and ecological benefit. Circadian clocks represent an evolutionary \nadaptation allowing plants to optimise their biochemical and physiological activities in \nanticipation of the varying demands of the day\/night cycle and to react to environmental \nsignals (Millar and Kay, 1996). From an evolutionary perspective, this ability to \nsynchronise with both external and internal environments may be critical to the plant\u2019s \nsurvival (Dodd et al., 2005). \nThe circadian rhythm in IE can be measured across a broad range of light and \ntemperature conditions, with the magnitude and amplitude dependent on these two \nparameters. Furthermore, by studying the transcriptional regulation of the central clock-\ncomponent CCA1\/LHY, we have determined that the oil palm molecular clock maintains \nrhythmicity at a higher temperature (38 \u02daC) than any previously recorded plant circadian \nrhythm. This suggests that a tropical species such as oil palm, which has evolved under \ntemperatures that commonly reach a daytime maximum of 38 \u02daC or more, has a clock \nthat is pre-adapted to function at elevated temperatures. In contrast, circadian rhythms in \n20 \n 20 \nmany other plants, including species native to hot climates, have been reported to \nbecome arrhythmic at temperatures in the range 30-32 \u02daC (Grams et al., 1995). \nImportantly, the period of the EgCCA1\/LHY rhythm is shorter at 38 \u02daC than it is at 25 \n\u02daC and this correlates well with the shortening of the IE period at 38 \u02daC. Together, these \nobservations provide circumstantial evidence for a CCA1\/LHY-TOC1-type molecular \noscillator underlying isoprene emission rhythms in oil palm trees. \nAt present, it is unknown at which level(s) circadian regulation is applied to \nisoprene emission. Investigation of available promoter regions (1000-2000 bp) from \npoplar isoprene synthase genes (GenBank accession numbers AM084344 and \nAY341431 and sequences in the Populus trichocarpa genome, http:\/\/genome.jgi-\npsf.org\/Poptr1\/Poptr1.home.html) reveals the presence of multiple copies of circadian-\nassociated cis elements. These include: the binding site for CCA1  (AAa\/cAATCT), \nwhich is conserved in light-harvesting complex (Lhc) gene promoters (Wang and Tobin, \n1998) and is found in a number of circadian-regulated gene promoters (reviewed in \n(McClung, 2000; Nozue and Maloof, 2006); the core conserved sequence \n(CANNNNATC) of a region required for circadian regulation of the tomato Lhc genes \n(Piechulla et al., 1998); and the \u2018evening element\u2019 (AAATATCT), which was identified \nby in silico analyses of circadian-regulated gene promoters (Harmer et al., 2000). These \nelements are all closely related and may in fact represent the same conserved sequence. \nTheir presence in the isoprene synthase gene promoters suggests that expression of \nisoprene synthase genes may be controlled in a circadian fashion at the transcriptional \nlevel. (Arimura et al., 2004) showed significant variability in isoprene synthase \ntranscript levels between day and night in poplar leaves; this is consistent with the \npossibility that transcript abundance is under circadian control. Post-transcriptional \n21 \n 21 \nregulation of circadian rhythms is also known to occur at several levels (reviewed in \n(Somers, 1999; Nozue and Maloof, 2006).  \nCircadian regulation may also be imposed on genes upstream in the MEP pathway \nfor isoprene synthesis, resulting in circadian fluctuation of IE. It has been suggested that \nisoprene emissions may act as a biological \u201csafety valve\u201d for excess chloroplastic \nenergy and carbon (Rosenstiel et al., 2004). Competition for phosphoenylpyruvate \n(PEP) between cytosolic and chloroplastic processes may result in changes in isoprene \nemission by preferentially diverting PEP away from the chloroplast (and hence isoprene \nsynthesis) via the anapleurotic pathway for nitrate assimilation. It has long been known \nthat nitrate assimilation is itself under circadian control at the level of nitrate reductase. \nAs a result, when nitrate levels begin to increase during the afternoon to a late \nevening\/early morning maximum (Yang and Midmore, 2005), isoprene emissions may \ndecrease due to increased cytosolic competition for PEP. It is also known that several \nother components of the PEP metabolic pathway are under circadian control at levels of \ntranscript abundance and protein activity (Hartwell et al., 1999; Streatfield et al., 1999; \nSullivan et al., 2004; Hartwell, 2005), though circadian regulation of all of these \ncomponents does not occur in all species. Clearly, the circadian control of PEP \nmetabolism and chloroplast-cytosol partitioning, and its relation to the circadian \nrhythms of isoprene emissions reported here, merit further detailed investigation in a \nspecies such as oil palm. We are currently investigating this and other molecular levels \nat which circadian control may be imposed on IE. \nSeveral attempts have been made to scale up isoprene emissions to produce \nregional and global scale emission inventories (Guenther et al., 1995; Simpson et al., \n1999; Stewart et al., 2003).  There are substantial uncertainties in these estimates \nalready, and our discovery of strong circadian control of isoprene emissions is an \nadditional complication that now must be taken into consideration when modelling \n22 \n 22 \nisoprene fluxes from the biosphere to the atmosphere. While it is not known how \nwidespread circadian regulation of isoprene emissions is, it is possible that other plant \nspecies as well as oil palm, especially in the tropics, exhibit this characteristic.   \nExperimental procedures \nField measurements of IE1000\/30 \nIsoprene emission rates (IE1000\/30) were measured from three frondlets of the \nsame frond of a 5 year old oil palm tree growing in an oil palm plantation (Sabah, \nMalaysia, February 2004). Samples were collected using a leaf cuvette system (LCpro; \nADC Biosciences, Hoddesdon, UK) which controlled PAR and leaf temperature (1000 \n\u00b5mol m-2 s-1; 30 \u00baC). Inflow air (350 ml min-1) was filtered through charcoal to remove \nozone and other ambient trace gases. Gas samples from the cuvette were taken into \nPerkin Elmer stainless steel sample tubes (89 mm x 6 mm O.D) at a rate of 100 ml min-1 \nfor 15 min. The sample tubes contained 100 mg Carbotrap to trap isoprene. After \nsampling, tubes were sealed with \u00bc\u201d Swagelock caps and PTFE ferrules. Previous work \nhas shown that samples can be stored for up to 8 weeks at 4 \u00baC without significant loss \nof compound, provided samples are collected from an ozone-free cuvette system (Owen \net al., 1997).  Isoprene analysis was carried out by thermal desorption\/capillary gas \nchromatography with mass selective detection (Possell et al., 2005). \nPlant material and growth conditions \nThree oil palm (Elaies guineenensis J. Gaertn.) trees were grown from seed for \ntwo years in Levingtons M3 compost (Fisons PLC, Ipswich, UK) in 10 litre containers \nunder 12 h light (250 umol m-2 s-1)\/12 h dark with the tree illuminated between the \n23 \n 23 \nhours of 06:00 and 18:00 at ambient temperatures of 30 \u00baC day and 20 \u00baC night. These \nconditions reflect typical under-storey conditions in a tropical plantation. \nLaboratory measurements of isoprene, CO2 assimilation and stomatal conductance \nIsoprene emission rates were measured using two systems. First we used a \ncontrolled environment broadleaf cuvette (PP-Systems, Hitchin, U.K.), modified for \nisoprene analysis, which allowed real time measurement of isoprene emission rates with \nsimultaneous measurement of plant physiology (carbon assimilation rate and stomatal \nconductance) from a 2.5 cm2 section of frondlet held at precise conditions of T and \nPAR. Secondly a custom built chamber for whole-frond measurements, containing \n~1200 cm2 of frond was used. The latter system allowed real time measurements of \nisoprene emission rates but not of physiology. \nLeaf physiological responses for the cuvette system were obtained using a \nCIRAS-1 differential CO2\/H2O infrared gas analyser (PP-Systems, Hitchin, U.K.) to \ncontrol humidity, CO2 concentration, leaf temperature, PAR and air flow rate through \nthe cuvette. Water vapour concentration and CO2 concentration were measured with a \nprecision of 0.7 mbar and 0.2 \u00b5l l-1 respectively. PAR was measured using a filtered \nsilicon detector with a response range of 400-700 nm with a controllable flux precision \nof \u00b110 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1. Inlet CO2 concentration was maintained at 360 \u00b5l l-1. Leaf \ntemperature was measured with an infrared radiation sensor. The air flow rate through \nthe cuvette was 350 ml min-1, giving a residence time of ~1 second. \n For whole frond branch measurements, excised palm fronds were cut under \nwater. The cut end of the frond was kept underwater and the whole frond placed in the \nchamber. Illumination was from cold fluorescent lighting tubes (120 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1). Leaf \ntemperature was controlled using thermocouples connected to a heat mat via a \n24 \n 24 \ntemperature controller (PXZ 4; Fuji Electric (UK Ltd), London), giving a frond surface \ntemperature of 25 \u00baC or 38 \u00baC (\u00b1 0.3 \u00baC). Air temperature, relative humidity and PAR \nwere measured simultaneously (RHT2nl and QS2 sensors; Delta-T Devices Ltd., \nCambridge, UK). All environmental parameters were recorded every 5 minutes using a \nDL2e data logger (Delta-T Devices Ltd., Cambridge, UK). The air flow rate through the \nchamber was 3 L min-1, giving a residence time of ~10 min. The rate at which air was \nintroduced into both cuvette and frond chamber was mass flow controlled and scrubbed \nof isoprene using activated charcoal.  \n Air from both leaf and frond chambers was introduced at a rate of 100 ml min-\n1\n into a proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) (Ionicon GmbH, \nInnsbruck, Austria) for isoprene analysis. The PTR-MS was calibrated by dilution of a \n700 ppb isoprene gas standard (Linde UK Ltd. Aberdeen, Scotland) and operated with \nan E\/N ratio of 125 Td (Hayward et al., 2002). Air samples from the cuvette were also \ncollected on 6 mm OD stainless steel sample tubes containing absorbent resin \n(Carbotrap; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) for isoprene identification using gas \nchromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (Turbomatrix Gold; Perkin Elmer, Boston. USA.). \nThe analytical procedure followed that of Possell et al. (2005). \nIdentification of an oil palm CCA1\/LHY orthologue \nWe identified an oil palm CCA1\/LHY EST in the GenBank EST database using \nthe TBLASTN search algorithm. The translated EgCCA1\/LHY EST (GenBank \naccession number CN600590) aligns with the Arabidopsis AtLHY protein from amino \nacid residue 235 to residue 350 and shares 35.4 % identity with AtLHY across this \nregion. Phylogenetic tree analysis confirmed that this EST was a good orthologue of \n25 \n 25 \nAtCCA1\/LHY and was most closely related to AtLHY (data not shown). We also \nidentified an oil palm EST that is an orthologue of the Arabidopsis polyubiquitin 10 \ngene (UBQ10), which we used as a loading control in our real-time PCR expression \nanalysis. This gene is routinely used in Arabidopsis as a loading control for real-time \nPCR analysis (Gould et al., 2006). The EgUBQ10 EST corresponds to GenBank \naccession number CN600235. Gene specific primers for real-time PCR of \nEgCCA1\/LHY and EgUBQ10 were designed as follows: EgCCA1\/LHYF 5\u2019-\nACCCTTTACCCAATTCCACA-3\u2019, EgCCA1\/LHYR 5\u2019-\nCAGGCTTGGATAAGGGTTCA-3\u2019, EgUBQ10F 5\u2019-\nGACAACGTCAAGGCCAAGAT-3\u2019 and EgUBQ10R 5\u2019-\nCTCGAGGGTGATCGTCTTTC-3\u2019. \nRNA isolation \nFrondlet samples were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen every six hours \nfrom an excised oil palm frond maintained in constant light (120 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1) and at a \nconstant temperature of either 25 \u00baC or 38 \u00baC in the branch chamber. Frozen frondlet \nsamples were ground in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle, and total RNA was \nisolated using an acetyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide-based RNA extraction procedure \n(Hartwell et al., 1996). The quantity and purity of the RNA were determined \nspectrophotometrically as described (Sambrook, 1989). \nReverse transcription and real-time PCR \nTotal RNA samples (1\u00b5g) were reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and \nthe QuantiTectTM Reverse Transcription kit with integrated genomic gDNA Wipeout \nbuffer (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \n26 \n 26 \nEgCCA1\/LHY transcript abundance was measured in each sample relative to EgUBQ10 \nusing real-time PCR in a Rotor-Gene 3000TM (Corbett Research Ltd, Cambridge UK). \nEach reaction contained 2 \u00b5l of cDNA and 6 \u00b5l of QuantiTectTM SYBR Green PCR mix \n(Qiagen, Crawley, UK) together with the gene specific primers for EgCCA1\/LHY or \nEgUBQ10. The efficiency value of amplification for each set of primers was determined \nby measuring the abundance of transcripts from a cDNA dilution series. Efficiency \nvalues were computed for each primer set using REST (Pfaffl et al., 2002). Each RNA \nsample was assayed in triplicate. The EgCCA1\/LHY transcript abundance levels were \nnormalised to EgUBQ10 using Q-gene software \n(http:\/\/www.biotechniques.com\/softlib\/qgene.html) (Muller et al., 2002). \n Acknowledgements: This work was funded by the Natural Environment Research \nCouncil.
