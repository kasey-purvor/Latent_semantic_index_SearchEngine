The latter has led to a proliferation of voluntary codes of practice \nand independent social and environmental certification systems. The private sector is \nmore explicitly engaging with the development agenda and using an increasingly \ndevelopmental language, of which ethical practices form part. It exercises influence \nthrough multi-lateral linkages with, for example, national development and finance \nministries, the World Bank, and corporate-funded foundations (Jones et al., 2007). While \nsome of this concern with business ethics has been driven by anti-corporate campaigning \n(Sadler, 2004) and various alternative trade movements, the business case has been \nestablished more rigorously than the development case. The gains for the company of \nhaving a good ethical reputation (attracting and retaining recruits, improving brand \nimage, increasing influence with policy makers, and attracting investment), and of \nextending its markets beyond conventional supply chains through certification (Higgins \net al., 2008), are more obvious than, for example, than the extent to which workers are \nempowered by codes of practice or their conditions of work improved (Nelson et al., \n2002; 2005).  \n \nRecent studies have sought to investigate the impact of certification schemes on farmers \nand farm livelihoods, the inclusion and exclusion of specific actors from certification \nprocesses, and the possibilities of transforming markets (see, for example, Giovannucci \nand Ponte, 2005; Gomez Tavar et al., 2005; Gonzalez and Nigh, 2005; Klooster, 2005; \n 4 \nPonte and Gibbon, 2005). However, the increasingly complex landscape of voluntary, \nindustry and third-party codes and certification processes that have emerged in specific \nsectors remains poorly understood. In particular, little is known about the potential threats \nposed by the complex and contested \u201eethical\u201f landscape in undermining radical initiatives \ndesigned to bring about improvements to material and social well-being. In response, this \npaper explores the current dynamics of social and environmental certification in the \nSouth African wine industry.  \n \nSince 1994, successive South African governments have faced the ethical and \ndevelopmental challenges of post-apartheid transformation, and the political and moral \nimperatives to dismantle racially delineated socio-economic disparities that rank the \nnation amongst the most unequal in the world (Bek et al., 2007). South Africa is playing \na leading role in advancing new corporate strategies, changing trade regulations, and \ndeveloping innovative ways of overseeing the globalized production and distribution of \ngoods (Gibbon and Ponte, 2005). An array of processes is operating simultaneously that \nseek to effect socioeconomic transformation, aimed specifically at improving historically \ndisadvantaged people\u201fs access to economic opportunities. The history of the South \nAfrican wine industry is intertwined deeply with the social history of slavery, which \nlong-continued to shape political, economic and cultural power relations (Kruger et al., \n2006) and appalling apartheid-era working conditions (Brown et al., 2003). It received \nsome of the worst anti-apartheid press, which exposed the infamous dop system\n1\n and has \nsince been used to motivate transformation. Thus, recent years have seen wholesale \nrestructuring (Ponte and Ewert, 2007), but the paternalistic, authoritarian and racialised \n 5 \nlabour regime inherited from slavery persists. Both NGO reports and academic research \ncontinue to reveal high levels of exploitation, including low wages, poor working \nconditions, increasing use of casual labour, an absence of black people in managerial and \nownership positions, and discrimination against women (Wijeratne, 2005; Barrientos et \nal., 2005; Tallontire et al., 2005; McEwan and Bek, 2006). In spite of legislation aimed \nspecifically at black economic empowerment, the deeply conservative character of the \nwine industry, and the fact that it is capital and skills intensive, means that transformation \nstill lags far behind other sectors (Kruger et al., 2006). \n \nDespite (or perhaps because of) this, the wine industry has witnessed a proliferation of \nnumerous voluntary codes and standards aimed at driving transformation. These cover a \nwide spectrum of aspects of labour conditions, production, processing, and quality \nmanagement (Ponte and Ewert, 2007). They include technical codes and standards, \nincluding ISO 9000 (quality management) and ISO 14000 (environmental management) \nand Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) systems for food safety.\n2\n They \nalso include social codes, such as the Wine and Agricultural Ethical Trade Association \n(WIETA) code (ref removed), fair-trade certification (Kruger and du Toit, 2007), internal \nindustry-wide audits and \u201eawards\u201f, such as the Rural Development Network\u201fs \n(RUDNET) Farm Health Award Programme, and the Wine Industry Charter. Voluntary \nstandards also cover organic and biodynamic certifications.  \n \nThis paper draws on fieldwork in the UK and Western Cape in 2006\n3\n to analyse these \noverlapping and sometimes conflicting processes of social and environmental \n 6 \ncertification, and the role of key drivers in establishing them within the wine industry. It \nexplores whether attempts to capture a portion of the expanding market for \u201eethical\u201f \nwines and the expansion of corporate interests in \u201eethics\u201f work to depoliticize the \nmeaning and nature of transformation. The research methodology was designed to cast \nlight on the different roles of actors within wine commodity networks, the ways in which \nthese actors are increasingly employing industrial and civic conventions such as codes \nand certification, and the effects of these shifts, both on producers and on broader \nprocesses of transformation within the industry. A multi-locale approach was used, \ntracking different institutional actors\u201f perceptions of social and environmental \ncertification and its role in socio-economic transformation. \n \nUK-based interviews were conducted with two CSR managers at major retailers of South \nAfrican wines, three NGO and two corporate charity representatives involved in ethical \ntrading initiatives, and an ethical produce importer\/supermarket supplier. Twenty-four \nformal interviews were conducted with institutional actors involved in South African \nagri-industries using prior contacts and snow-balling techniques. Of these nine are \ndirectly involved in the management of WIETA, a not-for-profit, voluntary organisation \nformed in 2002 to promote ethical trading within the South African wine industry, with \nan expanded remit that now covers horticulture.\n4\n Four are directly involved in the Flower \nValley Conservation Trust, established in 1999 to promote biodiversity conservation and \nsustainable resource use. Six respondents are wine-grape growers, three represent other \nprivate sector interests, three are involved in farm-worker unions, and four represent \nNGOs associated with agri-business and rural development.\n5\n Informal interviews were \n 7 \nheld with farm workers at a union-sponsored training event in Stellenbosch,\n6\n and with \nrepresentatives from NGOs, unions and the private sector. Industry reports and audit \nmaterials were also analysed. \n \nThe paper is organized into three sections. The first outlines the key debates about the \nmainstreaming of social and environmental certification and the role of corporate agendas \nin driving these processes. The second examines the complex terrain of regulatory codes \nand certification emerging in the South African wine industry, specifically around food \nstandards, environmental codes and social codes. The third examines the problems \nemerging in this increasingly complex \u201eethical\u201f landscape: the apparent and potential \nconflicts between various schemes; threats posed by convergence, especially around \nsocial and environmental certification; the threat of undermining reliable labels by \ncorporate interests, the proliferation of competing certification processes and their use as \na corporate governance tool. The paper considers whether burgeoning certification \nprocesses in the South African wine industry signal a growing gap between the abstract \nethical discourse of corporate actors, on the one hand, and the moral experience of \nworkers, on the other. It speculates on the consequences of separating an abstract debate \nover codified values, which is often conducted by global and local elites, from the \neveryday experience of workers (Kleinman 1999), and how this relates to transformation \nin the wine industry. \n \nCorporate mainstreaming of codes and certification  \n 8 \nCommodity network analysis has revealed the ways in which unequal distribution of \npower shapes relationships between consumers, producers and workers through networks \nthat are increasingly decentralised, transnational and global. In buyer-driven networks, \nlarge retailers have tended to determine what is produced and at what price (Gereffi, \n1994), but more recently a range of different actors have become significant in driving \nthe governance of global commodity networks, focusing on standards, auditing and \ncertification. A number of political-economic factors underpin this: increased private \nregulation of international trade; consumer concerns for social justice and environmental \nconservation helping to legitimise transnational regulation and certification systems; \nretailer desire to protect corporate reputations through robust certification and verification \nsystems (Mutersbaugh, 2005: 396-9; Townsend and Townsend, 2004).  \n \nIncreasingly, both retailers and NGOs have attempted to use the market to exert social \nand environmental values on production processes (Hughes, 2001; Ponte and Gibbon, \n2005). Convention theory provides one means of understanding these shifts. Originating \nin French economic theory (e.g. Boltansky and Th\u00e9venot 1991; Th\u00e9venot 1995), this has \nbeen applied to analysis of agro-food (Ponte 2007; Freidberg 2003a; Renard 2003). It \nintroduces sociological considerations to economic analysis, perceiving concepts such as \nquality as key, both in the analysis of economic life but also in contemporary competitive \nstrategies (Renard 2003). It also allows consideration of how, in the context of de-\nregulation in the agricultural sector, re-regulation is occurring around concerns about \nfood, environment and health (Watts and Goodman 1997).   \n \n 9 \nAs Ponte (2007) argues, the wine industry is framed by numerous quality conventions \n(see Table 1). Retailers increasingly employ industrial conventions, using technical codes \nand standards, and civic conventions, using processes of certification (organic, fair-trade, \nethical trade and environmental) (Renard, 2003; Ponte, 2007). However, it is now widely \nheld that as these interventions become more visible and influential in markets, they also \nbecome compromised by commercial market values (Renard, 1999; Raynolds, 2004; \nKlooster, 2005; Taylor, 2005). Thus, while NGOs have been successful in using retailer-\nfocused strategies to promote certification, and to create space for participation in the \ngovernance of buyer-driven commodity networks, once mainstreamed these processes \noften become strongly influenced by retailer dominance. This is particularly the case \nwithin food and other agricultural commodity networks (Klooster, 2005).  \n \nTable 1 Quality conventions in the wine industry (source: adapted from Ponte 2007: \n13) \n \nQuality convention Instrument of verification \nof \u2018quality\u2019 (general) \nInstrument of verification \nof \u2018quality\u2019 (in wine) \ninspiration personality unique wine; cult winemaker \nor property \ndomestic proximity, trust and \nrepetition \nbrand\/varietal, terroir, \nindication of geographic \norigin \nopinion external non-objective \njudgment \nendorsement by wine critic, \njudge, publication \ncivic impact on society and the \nenvironment \nassessment of food safety, \nenvironmental and social \nimpact, labels and \ncertifications \nmarket price price and promotion \nindustrial external objective \nmeasurement \nlaboratory tests, codification \nof procedures \n \n 10 \nOne consequence of this is that while social and environmental values promoted by \nNGOs and activists are increasingly mainstreamed, these values can be eroded by the \ncommercial values of driving firms, who condition the acceptance of certification upon \ncrossing hurdles such as price and volume, thus limiting spread and impact (Klooster, \n2005: 405). In addition, retailers influence the social and environmental values expressed \nand increasingly use socio-environmental certification for their own governance \npurposes. Many are using third party certification for external parameter setting and \nenforcement in order to shift the costs of monitoring and quality control to suppliers, thus \nachieving \u201econtrol at a distance\u201f (Ponte and Gibbon, 2005: 18). In developing countries, \nthe dual pressures of retailer-set pricing and the costs of ensuring compliance to codes \nand standards creates a cost-price squeeze for producers and suppliers. These new \ngovernance structures and the difficulties they create are epitomised by the South African \nwine industry, where competing certification schemes can create potentially negative \neffects, not only on workers who ultimately bear the burden of retailer-imposed \nconstraints (ref removed), but also by depoliticizing social and economic transformation.  \n \nRegulatory codes and certification schemes in the wine industry \nAs Table 2 illustrates, the South African wine industry is subject to numerous \ninternational and national regulatory codes and certification schemes. These are broadly \nconcerned with food safety, environmental protection and social protection. Of particular \nsignificance is that as food safety and ethical concerns become increasingly embedded \nwithin Northern markets, there is increasing evidence of convergence between previously \ndistinctive systems. These trends have already been noted in alternative trade, where \n 11 \nconvergence between ethical and fair-trade is increasingly likely within some \nsupermarket value chains (Smith and Barrientos 2005). In the Cape Winelands, social and \nenvironmental issues appear also to be undergoing significant convergence. \n \n 12 \nTable 2 Codes in the South African wine industry \n \nCode Type Date of \nInception \nPrimary \nActors \nGuiding Principles Auditing and Monitoring \nProcedures \nISO 9000 Industrial\/ \nTechnical: \nquality \nmanagement \n2001;

\nunlikely to be accepted \ninternationally as it \nduplicates ISO 22000. \n 15 \n \nFood standards and environmental codes \nFood standards have become particularly important in the wake of food scares and, \nalthough far removed from the agro-industries at the centre of these, growers have \nbecome increasingly subject to retailers\u201f efforts to reassure consumers about food safety \nand quality (Freidberg, 2003a; 2004). Consequently, most British supermarkets \u2013 which \npurchase over a third of South Africa\u201fs wine exports and constitute its biggest single \nmarket (Ponte and Ewert, 2007; SAWIS, 2006) \u2013 now demand that fresh produce is \n\u201etraceable\u201f, as well as adherence to strict codes concerning on-farm hygiene, \nenvironmental protection, and worker welfare. This is reflected in increased levels of \ncertification of South African wine, using both international and nationally-devised \nsystems. Until recently, only a few cellars had been certified against ISO 9000, ISO \n14000 and HACCP systems, but producers and exporters are keen to improve quality and \ntheir reputation with buyers. HACCP compliance is becoming more important (and \nexternally driven) because it is embedded in the British Retailer Consortium (BRC) \nGlobal Food Standard, which UK retailers favour. According to Ponte and Ewert (2007: \n44), the most significant technical standards within the South African wine industry are \nthe BRC, plus the national Integrated Production of Wine (IPW) Scheme. \n \nIn contrast to the BRC Standard, IPW is a semi-regulatory system providing guidelines \nthat conform to international standards for \u201eGood Agricultural Practices\u201f for farms and \n\u201eGood Manufacturing Practices\u201f for cellars to produce wines that are \u201ehealthy, clean and \nenvironmentally friendly\u201f (IPW 2004, cited in Ponte and Ewert, 2007: 45).7 The scheme \n 16 \nis voluntary, but registered IPW actors harvest 97% of South African grapes. The \nproportion of actually audited farms and cellars is much smaller, however, since the \nsystem is regulated via self-monitoring. Compliance can be achieved by scoring a \nminimum of 50% of the total score, a low threshold by international standards. All IPW \ncellars should be audited within a 5-year period, but farm visits remain at 36 per annum, a \ntiny proportion of over 4400 wine farms (SAWIS, 2006). In future it is likely that \nconformity certificates will be awarded to cellars only if an external audit has been \npassed (Ponte and Ewert, 2007: 45). IPW illustrates that where initiatives have emerged \nfrom within the local industry, the main imperative is conformity with Northern-defined \ninternational standards. They eventually become technical codes - essentially market-\nbased instruments, which reinforce a systems management approach to food safety and \nenvironmental and social protection, monitored using technical appraisal with no local \nstakeholder oversight.  \n \nThe South African wine industry is also developing regulatory practices to protect \nbiodiversity. One of the key drivers is the independent export company Wines of South \nAfrica (WOSA). Part of WOSA\u201fs decision to market on the basis of biodiversity arises \nfrom the difficulties in establishing a unique identity for South African wines on the basis \nof varietals and terroir\n8\n (in contrast to Old World wines). This is because of the use of \nmodern winemaking techniques in both vineyard and cellar, which purists argue obscure \nor even eliminate the influence of terroir in making different regions unique. WOSA\u201fs \nidea is that the rich biodiversity of the Western Cape can be translated into a great variety \nof wines and that appropriate stewardship of the Winelands can preserve this \n 17 \nbiodiversity. Notably, some organic producers (e.g. Stellar Organics) are now marketing \non the basis of \u201eorganic terroir\u201f. Commitment to biodiversity is embedded in the \nBiodiversity and Wine Initiative (BWI),\n9\n and in the guidelines of IPW.  \n \nAs a partnership between the wine industry and the conservation sector, the BWI aims to \nminimise further loss of unique and threatened natural habitat and to contribute to \nsustainable wine production through the adoption of biodiversity guidelines (see Table 2). \nIt aims to use the biodiversity of the Cape Floral Kingdom (CFK) and the wine industry\u201fs \nproactive stance on implementing biodiversity guidelines as unique selling points to \ndifferentiate \u201eBrand South Africa\u201f (Wineland 2005, in Ponte and Ewert, 2007: 69), thus \ntaking advantage of \u201egreen\u201f market opportunities. The CFK is a World Heritage Site, \nover 80% of which is privately owned, and conservation requires convincing landowners \nof the value of biodiversity. The BWI is the first project in this conservation strategy, \nworking directly with producers. Around 90% of wine production is located in the CFK \nand any expansion could endanger areas of natural habitat (especially renosterveld and \nlowland fynbos). The BWI brings benefits to the wine industry, in terms of a marketing \nstrategy to create competitive advantage, and to the conservation sector in pioneering \nbiodiversity best practice in agribusiness and conserving threatened habitats (Wineland \n2005, in Ponte and Ewert, 2007: 69).  \n \nAs of January 2009, the BWI has thirteen \u201echampions\u201f, ten cooperative cellar members \nand 114 regular members, representing the entire Cape Winelands \n(http:\/\/www.bwi.co.za\/members\/). BWI has expanded rapidly and already uses label-\n 18 \nbased certification. Before planting new vineyards, member producers \u201ecarry out a \nbotanical audit and draw up a plan to preserve endangered and significant species\u201f; some \nproducers set aside natural areas that will remain \u201eundeveloped in perpetuity\u201f (Ponte and \nEwert, 2007: 68-9). Membership is gained through scrutiny of farming conservation \npractices to ensure that the farmer is not simply \u201egreenwashing\u201f when making \nconservation or biodiversity claims, but fully compliant with guidelines. However, \nrequirements for membership are not particularly stringent since applicants are asked to \ncomply with biodiversity guidelines \u201ewhere appropriate\u201f and \u201eto the best of the \ncompany\u201fs ability\u201f and to \u201eresponsibly conserve\u201f the demarcated biodiversity area to \nobtain the IPW certificate. Biodiversity \u201echampions\u201f, however, need to score 85% of the \ntotal points in the self-assessment biodiversity form and comply with additional demands. \nVergelegen (now owned by Anglo-American) became the first champion in March 2005 \n(Ponte and Ewert, 2007). \n \nThe response from producers to biodiversity has been good because \u201ethey get it\u201f (wine \nindustry executive, interview 21\/09\/06). However, this requires a long-term vision often \nworking against the aims of marketing, which are much more short-term. Interviews \nsuggest that producers are aware of the potential future importance of creating a market \nniche, generating sustainable farming and water use, and developing potential links to \ntourism. However, BWI does not offer guidelines on how small farms could become \nsustainable in terms of biodiversity and it is difficult to see how many, apart from wine \ntourism complexes owned by mining companies, could be included.  \n \n 19 \nSocial codes \nTechnical codes concerned with food safety and environments make no attempt to \naddress social development outcomes of employment. In contrast, South African \nlegislative and moral imperatives requiring transformation have played a role in the \nproliferation of wine industry certification schemes based on social codes. Again, the \nrequirements of Northern retailers are significant, since South African produce is still \nvulnerable to consumer sensitivities towards survival of apartheid working practices. \nWIETA, with the support of UK retailers, is the prime driver. Fair-trade initiatives also \nrequire social auditing by the Fair-trade Labelling Organisation (FLO). Local social \nauditing initiatives include RUDNET\u201fs Farm Health Awards and the Wine Industry \nCharter.  \n \nWIETA originated as a UK government Ethical Trade Initiative pilot project in 1999 and \noperates via a tripartite alliance comprising corporations, NGOs and trade unions. \nDespite the history of bitter antagonism, the pilot was pivotal in bringing these \nstakeholders together for the first time and assisting South African partners in developing \nand refining inspection methodologies for monitoring on-farm labour standards. Its \nsuccess led to local actors devising a home grown model in 2002 \u2013 the first of its type in \nthe world \u2013 setting the parameters for implementing and auditing ethical labour practices \nand working conditions in the Winelands. It is managed through an executive committee \ncomprising individuals representing different interest groups, including WOSA, \norganised labour, NGOs and the Department of Labour. Key principles of its code of \ngood practice (see Table 2) reflect both the ETI base-code and issues specific to South \n 20 \nAfrican agriculture (WIETA, 2003; Bek et al., 2007). These are monitored through a \nsocial auditing inspection process (ref removed; Lewis, 2005), and complemented by \nefforts to educate producers and workers about the content of the code and its practical \nimplementation. The imperative is to establish a dynamic upward trajectory of \nimprovement in social conditions on farms rather than to \u201efail\u201f or shame producers.  \n \nWIETA currently has 199 members of whom 103 are wine producers,\n 10\n including major \nco-operatives (KWV, Distell, Vinfruco, Western Wines), individual farms and estates, \nand major export bodies (Fruitways, Capespan). Audits began in early 2004 and, to date, \n33 producer members have been accredited. This represents a modest impact. It also \nappears that recruitment from the wine sector has stalled, perhaps as a consequence of \nboth the cost of compliance and the harsh international context for wine production, \nwhich makes any commitment to social improvements difficult. The absence of a \nlabelling system, in contrast to the BWI and fair-trade and organic production, could also \nbe a factor. While retailers have been supportive there is little evidence of changes in \nprocurement practices. However, WIETA has recently expanded into fruit and flower \nproduction, largely at the behest of UK retailers, which could provide significant impetus \nwithin the wine sector. Unlike fruit and flowers, the wine industry has a complicated \nsupply chain that involves growers, cellars, co-operatives, bottling operations, \npackhouses and export marketing companies; there is thus comparatively less \nreputational risk for retailers. As one WIETA executive explains, supermarkets are \u201every \nhard and prescriptive on their own label fruit, less so with wine\u201f (interview 14\/09\/06); \nthey rarely produce own-label wines and do not perceive it their business if suppliers are \n 21 \nnot compliant. Despite this, expansion into horticulture is viewed optimistically by wine \nindustry representatives who predict that WIETA will grow, \u201ehave more teeth\u201f (ibid.), \nand greater energy and finance.  \n \nUK retailers were instrumental in WIETA\u201fs emergence and are critical to its ability to \nmaintain momentum in transforming working conditions within the industry. \nMembership is seen as important only when it is linked to securing an export contract \nwith UK retailers. The costs of achieving compliance are high, sites are rarely compliant \nafter the initial audit, and implementing corrective actions can be expensive (one \nproducer reported costs of R200-250,000 (\u00a314-19,000). For retailers, codes of conduct \nare a necessary business protocol offering a relatively inexpensive measure to protect \ncorporate reputations. Ensuring that suppliers meet acceptable standards is simpler if \nmanaged through a single organisation. Thus, some observers believe that retailers may \nseek to source all South African wines from WIETA members. Significantly, Sweden \n(through its monopoly agency Systembolaget) is seeking South African suppliers of \n\u201eethical\u201f wines. It appears likely that all exports will be sourced from WIETA members, \nhelping maintain momentum in transforming working conditions on farms. \n \nAlthough currently less significant to retailers, a potential local competitor to WIETA is \nRUDNET\u201fs Farm Health Awards. RUDNET is the NGO arm of the Black Association of \nthe Wine and Spirits Industry (BAWSI), which aims to make the wine industry fully \nrepresentative and able to play a meaningful role in empowering black South Africans to \nbecome farmers and farm owners. RUDNET was established in 2002 to facilitate socio-\n 22 \neconomic empowerment and skills training of farm workers, to promote the social \ninclusion of farm workers in civil organs, and to address social problems such as poverty, \nalcoholism, limited education and poor health on farms. It has run the FHA since 2003, \nsuccessfully recruiting over 100 producers and receiving much positive local publicity. \nThe FHA, unlike WIETA, is an enterprise initiative from within the local industry. It has \ntwo elements: the nomination of farm workers who have acted as a source of inspiration \nto their communities, and an auditing system examining various aspects of working \nconditions on farms (RUDNET, 2006). The audit takes the form of an interview with the \nfarmer, completion of a largely tick-box questionnaire, and a site visit. Farms are given a \nscore (not reported publicly except for the winners in each size category) and advice on \nareas for improvement. The winners receive awards at an annual gala event. Although \nbased largely on a social code, the FHA is completely producer-driven and, as discussed \nsubsequently, other wine industry stakeholders have expressed concern about the \nsuperficial audits. Despite this, one FHA source claims that producers are using FHA \nsurvey results to convince buyers that they can be assured of on-farm standards, that \nproblems are being identified and steps taken to rectify these (interview 06\/09\/06). \n \nEven so, it is difficult for the FHA not to reflect the entrenched paternalistic attitudes of \nfarmers towards their workers, evident in its aim to \u201eboth motivate and acknowledge farm \nworking communities and individuals\u201f (RUDNET 2005: 1). Farmers themselves report \non levels of alcohol abuse, violence and foetal alcohol syndrome, which can distort \nrealities. There appears to be no contact with farm workers or any third-party verification, \napart from by the FHA co-ordinator. RUDNET audit reports reveal that poor conditions \n 23 \npersist \u2013 \u201ethe age group 14-28 is prone to alcohol abuse;\u201f \u201efamily violence is still rife \namongst worker communities\u201f, \u201ethere is poverty due to farm workers spending their \nincome on debt\u201f (RUDNET 2005: 6) \u2013 but imply that blame lies with workers \nthemselves. There is no analysis of historical and structural causes of such problems, of \ncurrent working and living conditions, or of structural measures that might be put in place \nto transform these. Preventative measures are in the form of \u201elife skills training\u201f and \neducation of workers. Moreover, \u201ecriteria aren\u201ft enforced, but merely serve as \nguidelines\u201f.11 There are significant questions, therefore, about what impact FHA can have \non the status quo. \n \nAs with ethical trade, the South African wine industry has played a pioneering role in \nfair-trade wines. Wine certification was designed and implemented for the first time in \nSouth Africa and includes brands that have had notable success (Thandi, Fairhills, Stella \nOrganics). FLO certification and labelling began in South Africa in 2003. It has not been \nwithout controversy, since large estates have received fair-trade status following audits of \nwage levels, health and safety, worker housing, structures for negotiation and collective \nbargaining. One wine cellar Managing Director claims that FLO certification is expensive \nand a farm would need to harvest and sell around 100 tonnes of grapes to be able to \nafford the \u20ac500 registration fee (interview 04\/09\/06). As part of the fair-trade agreement, \nthe estate is required to set up a Joint Body controlled by representatives of the estate \nmanagement and farm workers. This body decides how to use the fair-trade premium, \nusually for community development purposes (EMG 2005). The labelling system \nguarantees to consumers that wine was produced and traded under fair conditions, \n 24 \nincluding the payment of a minimum price and a social premium for socio-economic \ndevelopment.  \n \nIn comparison to other food and drink commodities, fair-trade wine has been slow to \ngrow, primarily because wine is considered a luxury product and consumer preferences \nare often driven by inspiration, domestic and opinion quality conventions rather than \ncivic conventions (see Table 1). However, since 2006 the market has expanded \nsignificantly, with 22 FLO-certified South African wine producers providing the UK and \nother European markets at the time of writing. More than 3 million bottles were sold in \n2006 compared with 800,000 in 2004 (Langton, 2007).  \n \nFair-trade community development initiatives have some synergies with South African \ngovernment policy concerning Black Economic Empowerment (BEE), which also \nincludes a potentially significant wine industry social code. BEE emerged in the early \n1990s as a way of redressing the structured economic inequality. It is not affirmative \naction, although employment equity forms part of it, nor does it aim to redistribute \nwealth. It is essentially a growth strategy. Its original intention was the creation of a black \nmiddle class to broaden the economic base and facilitate upliftment of the black majority. \nHowever, this focus on the black middle class, rather than dealing directly with mass \npoverty, has been extremely controversial. Critics accusing it of merely enriching an \nalready powerful black elite, without effecting broad socio-economic change, and of \ndepoliticising transformation (Kruger et al., 2006). \n \n 25 \nIn response, the government passed the Broad-based BEE Act in 2003, which seeks to \ncounter criticisms by generating a wider process of social and economic upliftment.\n12\n \nHowever, the Codes of Good Practice for Broad-based BEE were only gazetted by the \ngovernment in February 2007 and their potential impact is still unclear. The main \nchallenges facing BEE in the wine industry are the highly skewed ownership regime, \nadvancing women in the industry, mobilising knowledge, business acumen, capital and \nsocial capital, and rural development and poverty alleviation. The South African Wine \nIndustry Council, representing all industry stakeholders, was created in 2006 to deliver \nthe Wine Industry Transformation Charter. The Charter aims to, \u201eopen paths of \nopportunity for those previously excluded under apartheid; and to provide a decent way \nof life and human dignity to those who work on the wine farms\u201f (ibid.: 1). It is \u201ebased on \nand substantially aligned with the Codes of Good Practice on BEE\u201f (WIC, 2007: 1). It \nuses a scorecard to assess enterprises on a points-based system. The scorecard awards \npoints on the creation of growth and new business opportunities, the creation of investor \nconfidence through a focus on equity and transparency, the focus on human development \nas a key driver of sustainable empowerment, the establishment of partnerships between \nbusiness and government,  and enhanced recognition for black women and black \ndesignated groups (disabled, youth, rural and unemployed) (WIC, 2007: 2-3). \n \nCritics of BEE point out that it allows a conservative agenda to be embedded in official \nframeworks such as the Charter and the technical monitoring tools associated with it \n(Kruger et al., 2006: 1). As discussed subsequently, such processes lock socio-economic \nconcerns in standards, scorecards, codes and certification schemes, which shifts the \n 26 \nnature of the debate about transformation from the political to the technical (Klooster, \n2005) and, in turn, fails to transform structural, racial and power imbalances (Kruger et \nal., 2006:  26). Significantly, micro enterprises (those with turnover below R5 million), \nare exempt from the 2007 BEE Codes. Based on estimated turnover and available \nstatistics, approximately 80% of wine farms are exempt.\n \nThe Charter states that all \nproducers, including those not required, should strive to comply. However, while Wine \nCharter Steering Committee surveys in 2004 and 2005 revealed 60% of industry \nparticipants to be in favour of BEE, 80% said they lacked the capacity to be involved. \nOnly 5% have become involved in shareholder schemes for BEE or profit-sharing \nprogrammes (WIC, 2007: 12). Without a legislative requirement to adopt BEE codes, \ntherefore, market-driven transformation based on social and environmental codes is likely \nto remain important in generating change within the industry.  \n \nAssessing the complex terrain of certification systems \nThe South African wine industry is currently replete with competing technical, social and \nenvironmental certification schemes, some of which (e.g. food standards, fair-trade and \nWIETA) are driven by external agents (primarily Northern retailers) and involve third-\nparty certification, and others (e.g. FHA and BWI) that have emerged from within the \nlocal industry and are largely self-certifying systems. These operate within the context of \nprogressive labour laws (enforced \u2013 or not \u2013 by a seriously under-resourced Department \nof Labour) and a largely conservative BEE business agenda. This complexity raises a \nnumber of issues around three specific areas: conflict, convergence and corporate \ngovernance. \n 27 \n \nConflict and turf wars \nCertification initiatives are \u201eshaped by competition among participating parties as they \nseek to control the rules of the game in pursuit of often-conflicting interests\u201f \n(Mutersbaugh et al., 2005: 381). There is thus potential for \u201eturf wars\u201f between different \n\u201eethical\u201f systems. Interviews with diverse constituents in the wine industry hint at areas \nof conflict, specifically the prickly politics between WIETA and FLO and the general \nscepticism of both towards FHA. The latter illustrates the complex politics within the \nindustry. Some respondents either refused to talk about FHA or at least were very \nuncomfortable. Although it appears to be white farmer-oriented and organised, it also \nappears to have supporters amongst other stakeholders, notably BAWSI. However, \nBAWSI also divides opinion, with one former member accusing it of being a vehicle for \nBEE self-enrichment (interview 22\/09\/06). Other respondents felt that because FHA does \nnot have international recognition and its audits are superficial it would not achieve a \ngreat deal. As a WIETA representative argues, \u201eAn award is an award. It should not go \nthrough an audit process\u2026 If you call it an audit you cannot bullshit. If you call it self-\nassessment it is totally different\u201f (interview 14\/09\/06).  \n \nWhile representatives of labour unions are largely positive about WIETA (Women on \nFarms Representative, interview 30\/08\/06), they are equally dismissive of FHA. A former \nunion representative, now on the WIETA Board, suggests that \u201ewhite people are never \ngoing to change the [industry]\u2026 the poor man getting the crumbs from the rich man\u201fs \ntable. That sums up FHA\u201f (interview 15\/09\/06). Some respondents suggest FHA and \n 28 \nWIETA would be better served by co-operation, with WIETA providing more robust \nauditing procedures and code of practice, but this seems unlikely. Claims by an FHA \nsource that some producers are dropping WIETA in favour of FHA audits are plausible \ngiven significant differences in requirements (interview 06\/09\/06). Despite being \nimpossible to verify, such claims highlight concerns about the implications for \nsubstantive on-farm improvements in working conditions.  \n \nWIETA has also had a fraught relationship with FLO. It appears there have been aborted \nattempts to work collaboratively, which have fuelled antagonisms (WIETA \nrepresentative, interview 01\/09\/06). Interviews with various constituencies within the \nwine industry reveal local dissatisfaction with fair-trade, specifically that it is not \ndelivering (at least in the South African context) all that it promises. One WIETA source \nmaintains that FLO is bureaucratic, uses Eurocentric systems, and is more profit-making \norganisation than public interest company (interview 14\/09\/06). Other respondents \nsuggest it has ring-fenced supply chains in an anti-competitive manner, providing \nparticular retailers with exclusive access to specific products without effecting \nmeaningful transformation. One producer commented that he had to change nothing to \nmeet FLO criteria, but had received several non-compliances in a WIETA audit \n(interview 04\/09\/06).  \n \nRespondents working within competing alternative trade initiatives also question whether \nthe FLO premium-funded community projects would have been funded by the farmer \nanyway, especially in more remote areas where municipal services are lacking. If so, they \n 29 \nallege that FLO may have saved the farmer money and produced no net improvement. \nHowever, this tends to ignore the fact that prevailing market conditions, in which up to \n50% of producers are struggling (ref removed), do not provide a climate conducive to \ninvesting resources into social projects. As a union representative puts it, \u201eThe neoliberal \nagenda has made things tough. No duty on goods has made things tough. The playing \nfield is not level\u2026 and then people talk about fair-trade and ethical trade\u201f (interview \n15\/09\/06). Concerns are also raised by respondents about the compatibility of fair-trade \nin the wine industry and consumer expectations. For example, the premium is paid to \nfarmers with turnovers in excess of R50 million, in part a consequence of the atypical \nnature of the local supply chain. Citrusdal Cellars, for example, source their grapes from \nseveral farms, each of which has to be fair-trade certified. Some farms produce several \ncommodities (grapes, rooibos, citrus fruit), all of which can be sold on as fair-trade \nbecause the farm is certified as a single unit. It is perhaps unsurprising that it appears odd \nto some within competing ethical initiatives that farms with such huge turnovers could \nbenefit from fair-trade status and associated price guarantees. Some respondents from \nfair-trade initiatives are also aware of these contradictions. In addition, Co-op\u201fs own \nbrand fair-trade wine is bottled in Germany to save money, enabling it to be sold at under \n\u00a35 a bottle. This increases market share but also reduces employment opportunities for \nSouth African workers through downstreaming (wine cellar Managing Director, \ninterview 04\/09\/06).  \n \n 30 \nA wine industry executive (interview 21\/09\/06) highlights the problems concerning the \ncomplex auditing terrain, the failure by other constituencies to work with WIETA, and \nthe conflict and inertia that this is producing: \n \n[WIETA] has stalled in terms of recruitment. The industry is in a mess. No one \nwill do anything unless they have to. People who have been through the audit \nhave acknowledged the benefits - communication, what happens in farms, \ndevelopment of labour. But there are so many audits. The big problem is fair-\ntrade \u2013 it is selling well in key markets but is no longer a public benefit \norganisation. A war is going on within auditing. WIETA should be doing their \n[FLO\u201fs] auditing. Fair-trade has been a big disappointment, the way they have \nbehaved. Because UK supermarkets are behind fair-trade it is in a strong position. \nIt is shame. If ethical purchasing managers had more clout they could say \u201ecome \non, sort it out. You are causing huge problems.\u201f WIETA standards are higher than \nFLO. WIETA have done all they can to challenge things [but] the producer would \nrather have a fair-trade audit, get a label and space in a UK shop.  \n \nThere is a sense within the industry, therefore, that better cooperation would actually \nhave greater impact on effecting transformation. Despite fraught and often bitter politics, \nthere are some signs of increasing convergence across different schemes. However, this \nalso raises potential problems. \n \nConvergence: the dangers of \u2018greenwashing\u2019  \n 31 \nThe Cape wine industry is currently witnessing important convergences between social \nand environmental concerns. Northern consumer pressure has required sustainability to \nencompass both social and environmental sustainability, with the latter also being closely \nlinked with organics (Brown et al., 2000). Ethical, organic and environmentally-\nsustainable trading is beginning to overlap and some South African observers see the \nBWI as a major way forward in linking together ethical production and environmental \nissues. Thus, WIETA and the BWI have begun discussions about whether \u201eyou can \nactually look at so-called ethical issues without also looking at the environment\u201f (wine \nindustry executive, interview 21\/09\/06). This echoes the call from some commentators \nfor greater integration of social and environmental issues (Blowfield, 1999; Momsen, \n2007), and reflects business imperatives that require goods and services to be produced \nunder conditions that are both socially and environmentally responsible. Some \nrespondents believe it would be ideal to have a single symbol or label that ties together \nethics and environment across the whole of South African agri-industries.  \n \nThe FLO, through its involvement in the Flower Valley Conservation Trust, is also \nshowing signs of greater convergence with environmental issues. Moore et al. (2006) \nargue that fair-trade has promoted an anthropocentric over an ecocentric view of the \nworld. However, while fair-trade generally remains committed to its primary focus on the \nsocial and economic development of marginalised producers, environmental \nsustainability is included in FLO Generic Standards \n(http:\/\/www.fairtrade.net\/generic_standards.html) and there is a long-standing \nrelationship between fair-trade and organic production. There have been some problems \n 32 \nwith this; for example, Raynolds et al. (2007) suggest that some fair-trade coffee \nproducers have used the social premiums to pay for the expensive conversion process to \norganic production and for organic certification, rather than investing the premium back \ninto communities. In the Cape, however, there appears to be greater scope for combining \nhuman and environmental concerns because of the moral and economic imperatives that \nprioritise social transformation. Stellar Organics, for example, markets wines that are \nboth organic and fair-trade; organic farming preceded fair-trade certification and the fair-\ntrade premium is used to fund the Stellar Fairtrade Workers Trust. This has delivered \nimprovements to workers\u201f housing and a local school. Current projects include \npurchasing a 26% shareholding in Stellar Winery and an adjacent farm, which will be \nowned and managed by the workers. Organic grapes grown on this land will be sold to \nthe winery as part of the Trust\u201fs aim to empower workers.  Furthermore, schemes such as \nthe BWI have been very successful in providing a model in which new initiatives can be \nat once environmentally appropriate (maintaining biodiversity, productivity and \necological processes), socially beneficial (local people benefit and incentives are \nprovided to maintain resources and long-term management), and economically viable \n(profitable but without generating profit at expense of resources, ecosystem or affected \ncommunities). \n \nDeveloping countries have been generally reluctant to participate in ecolabelling \ninitiatives, highlighting protectionist elements and naivet\u00e9 in assuming that Northern-\ndevised standards and models of environmental management can be exported tout court \n 33 \nto the South (Ponte, 2006). This reluctance has been countered by assurances of \ntransparency, non-discrimination and technical assistance: \n \nIn essence, ecolabels are assumed to be \u201egood for the global commons\u201f and their \njustification has been offered within a discourse of science, objectivity, \nindependent certification, transparency and systems management. As long as \nmarket-based mechanisms of ensuring sustainability, such as ecolabels, are seen \nas \u201eneutral\u201f, larger politico-economic factors, market structures and the role of \nspecial interests and expert knowledge will remain in the twilight. (Ibid.: 48) \n \nHowever, these processes are rarely neutral or equal. One concern in South Africa is the \nway in which environmental values can be used to stymie social and economic \ntransformation. Ponte (2006) cites the case of the Marine Stewardship Council \ncertification to demonstrate that, although couched in the discourse of conservation, this \nwas used as a tool against the redistribution of fishing quotas away from larger, mainly \nwhite-owned fisheries to black-owned, smaller enterprises and new entrants. Some \nobservers fear that similar arguments might be used with regard to empowerment \nmeasures within agri-businesses. Therefore, local politics and the situated political \neconomy of conservation matter for environmental certifications. \n \nThere are specific problems with the concept of biodiversity in the wine industry. \nWOSA\u201fs motto is \u201ediversity is in our nature\u201f, yet viticulture is a monoculture that \ndestroys rather than enhances biodiversity. Only large producers, of which there are few \n 34 \nin South Africa, could afford to set  aside large tracts of land for conservation; \nmeanwhile, the expansion of the wine industry since 1994 has already destroyed large \nareas of fynbos. Moreover, the industry is hardly diverse, especially at ownership and \nmanagerial levels (Kruger et al., 2006; McEwan and Bek, 2006; Williams, 2005). Farm \nworkers and cellar hands are entirely invisible in BWI promotional literature (Ponte and \nEwert 2007). Prevailing market conditions limit the capacity of farmers to invest \nresources into conservation; the costs of environmental stewardship may in turn prohibit \nthe promotion of distributive justice priorities. Emphasis on biodiversity thus might be \naccused of corporate \u201egreenwashing\u201f that masks the true nature of the environmental \ncosts of viticulture and the deep-seated inequalities that it perpetuates. Focusing on \n\u201enature\u201f for the export market arguably allows the industry to avoid facing potentially \nmore uncomfortable options (e.g. land redistribution, import boycotts, and better working \nconditions) to redress enduring race-based inequalities (Kruger et al., 2006: 25). It is \nperhaps telling that the BWI attempts to recruit members and champions on the basis of \ncorporate image, positive marketing and media exposure benefits. Indeed, it states \ndirectly that members \u201ecan proudly market your wines or farming operation\u2026, without \nrunning the risk of being accused of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d\u201f (http:\/\/www.bwi.co.za\/member-\noption\/ accessed 20\/01\/09).  \n \nThere are additional dangers that the persistent and historically-rooted inequities in South \nAfrican wine production are erased in \u201esanitised\u201f accounts that foreground the unique \nCFK environment. Critics allege that the business community is a key player in \npromoting these sanitised images for international consumption (Lewis, 2000: 46) and it \n 35 \nis clear that, as far as BWI and WOSA are concerned, \u201ebiodiversity is being actively \nconserved as part of promoting the new Brand South African image\u201f \n(http:\/\/www.bwi.co.za\/member-option\/ accessed 20\/01\/09). The apparent convergence \nbetween social and environmental issues also gives rise to concerns about the dilution of \ninfluence of ethical and fair-trade through mainstreaming, and any attempt at prioritising \nenvironmental concerns over human needs is likely to meet stiff opposition in South \nAfrica. The uniqueness of reliable labels, such as fair-trade, and social auditing schemes, \nsuch as WIETA, is at risk of being undermined by corporate interests \u201ewashing the \nmarket in claims of philanthropic largesse, ethical treatment of producers, labor codes, \nand sustainability-certifying labels\u201f (Fridell et al., 2008: 29). \n \nCertification as a technical governance tool \nEnvironmental and social standards, such as fair-trade, WIETA and biodiversity, are \nbeginning to resemble industrial conventions, such as the BRC, ISO standards and \nHACCP. As the South African wine industry expands, civic and domestic conventions \nbecome more difficult to maintain and new standards are required; Ponte (2007: 22) \nrefers to these as \u201ecivic\/industrial\u201f: \n \nIn mid-range quality wines, social and environmental certifications (such as \norganic, or WIETA) are still considered a \u201eplus\u201f, not a demand that is considered \nas a \u201egiven\u201f. Therefore, although they are operationalised through instruments that \nare \u201eindustrial\u201f in nature, they still maintain traits of civic convention. \n \n 36 \nOne concern arising from this apparent convergence is the way in which certification \nbecomes embedded as a governance tool, with emphasis on technical regulatory \nmechanisms rather than processes that can deliver radical change. As discussed \npreviously, embedding social and environmental concerns in standards, codes of conduct \nand certification schemes shifts the nature of the debate from the political to the \ntechnical, meaning that only marginal corrections can be made subsequently (Klooster, \n2005; Ponte, 2006). Klooster (2005) identifies four phases in which this emptying out of \npolitics takes place. First, activist groups organize boycotts, direct actions and media \ncampaigns against corporate culprits of misbehaviour. Second, advocacy groups devise \nguidelines for good behaviour and facilitate the creation of an organisation or stakeholder \ngroup (e.g. WIETA, BWI) that includes important representatives of the culprits. Third, \nadvocacy groups aggressively promote the increasingly standardized, codified and \ntechnically complex instrument they have developed in the stakeholder forum among a \nlarger group of culprits and government. Grassroots initiatives thus become \nmainstreamed, document-intensive, managerialised and explicitly concerned with \ncommercial feasibility and marketing. Activists pressure retailers to commit to buying \nonly certified wine; retailers pressure their suppliers to certify. Consequently, \ncertification mainstreams activist concerns about detrimental social and environmental \nimpacts into a \u201edocument-intensive, buyer-driven preoccupation\u201f for delivering large \nquantities of certified wine to market (Klooster, 2005: 412). The fourth phase usually \naddresses resultant problems, unintended consequences, and excluded and marginalized \ngroups through correctives measures to the now concretised system.  \n \n 37 \nAs Kruger et al. (2006: 26) argue, there is currently plenty of evidence from various \nsectors to suggest that this is occurring in South Africa. Structural, racial and power \nimbalances are not being addressed before stage four is reached (BEE is currently \nbetween phases two and three), and transformation is thus likely to be technical and \napolitical. Thus the abilities of WIETA, fair-trade and FHA to achieve meaningful \ntransformation are restricted by the conservative BEE context in which they operate. \nHowever, there are differences between BEE, FHA and WIETA codes, and between \nWIETA and fair-trade. WIETA compliance is more demanding than its competitor \nschemes and it is also most heavily-invested in by European retailers. There are thus \ndifferences in how the wine has been produced and the labour conditions that underpin \nproduction. WIETA has raised standards of working conditions on participating farms, \nparticularly in the area of health and safety (ref removed). While these differences are \nimportant, \u201ethe politics of transforming the industry should be more than a choice of \nsocial brands\u201f (Kruger et al. 2006: 28). Rather, the gaze should remain squarely on power \nrelations \u2013 between supermarkets and cellars; between cellars and farmers; between \nfarmers and workers.  \n \nA further problem, then, emerges from bureaucratisation of ethical and fair-trade \ninitiatives in the wine industry and their failure to explicitly problematise and politicise \npower relations. While fair-trade addresses some of the inequalities of the trading system \nand the organic movement questions the very nature of an industrial approach to \nagriculture, both are perceived to be becoming more bureaucratic (Raynolds 2004; Taylor \n2005), and there are problems with mainstreaming and convergence around international \n 38 \nstandards. The FLO\u201fs efforts to enhance compatibility with ISO labelling standards, for \nexample, has led to internal restructuring of its certification activities and financing \npolicies, moves which have elicited complaints of increased distance from producer \nparticipants (Renard, 2005). As Ponte (2006: 49) argues, \u201ethis has happened in parallel to \na general move from a holistic and hands-on engagement with suppliers and towards \nmore hands-off, auditable, systemic and managerial approaches to sustainability\u201f. Expert \nknowledge becomes privileged and if shortcomings arise they can be fixed technically \nand managerially. Moreover, conformity to systems performance and specific rules \nbecomes more important than achieving the stated objectives of \u201esustainability\u201f or \n\u201efairness\u201f. Verification becomes a pedagogical tool, not meant to exclude but to teach \nmanagement and better conformity. There is a need, therefore, to promote a movement \naway from rules and scorecards back to principles, which entails a \u201eless managerialist \napproach and more room for judgment on how principles can be achieved in specific \npolitical economies and local conditions\u201f (Ponte, 2006: 52) Yet evidence from the \nWinelands suggests that on some farms even fair-trade, supposedly less managerialist, is \nmoving in the opposite direction with the separation of producer support functions from \ncertification, driven by the need to comply with international codes and standards. \n \nThe threat to the radical potential of social and environmental certification schemes lies \nin the distinction between corporate ethical discourse and the moral experience of \nworkers. Ethical discourse is, \u201ean abstract articulation and debate over codified values\u2026 \nconducted by elites, both local and global\u2026 [It] is usually principle-based, with \n 39 \nmetatheoretical commentary on the authorization and implication of those principles\u201f \n(Kleinman, 1999: 363). In contrast, moral experience is: \n \n[Always] about practical engagements in a particular local world, a social space \nthat carries cultural, political and economic specificity. It is about positioned \nviews and practices: a view from somewhere\u2026 [and]\u2026 the actualities of specific \nevents and situated relationships. [It] is the medium of engagement in everyday \nlife in which things are at stake and in which ordinary people are deeply engaged \nstakeholders who have important things to lose, to gain, and to preserve. (Ibid.: \n365; 362) \n \nThe complex landscape of social and environmental certification emerges from retailer \ndiscourses that are positioned squarely in the realm of the ethical (Dovey, 2003). In \ncontrast, farm worker experiences are located in the realm of moral experience. In the \nSouth African wine industry, and in agri-business more broadly, the lived experience of \nworkers appears to be in danger of becoming ever more distanced from the increasingly \ncontested and conflictual corporate ethical realm. The consequence of this is that despite \nproliferation of codes, standards and certifications, very little is likely to change in the \nlives and conditions of work for farm workers. \n \nThe South African wine industry is shaped by twin drivers \u2013 the power of international \nretailers and the conservative national business context through which BEE is translated \ninto practice. This context is also significant, since it sets the parameters of what might \n 40 \nreasonably be expected from WIETA\u201fs efforts and those of others in the \u201eethical\u201f sector. \nIn many ways, they are part a \u201erepackaging of ethical\/equity\/race concerns that takes \nplace in the wine industry through technologies of self-governance\u201f (Kruger et al., 2006: \n25). This is not unique in its kind or to South Africa. Private regulation is now well \nestablished in areas of social and environmental concern that used to be the domain of the \nstate. Both public and private regulation are emerging through self-governance \nmechanisms (development of codes of conduct, standards, certification\/auditing, \nlabelling, accreditation systems) that are the implementing arm of \u201estakeholder\u201f \ncapitalism (Ponte and Gibbon, 2005). As Freidberg (2003b: 35) argues, UK retailers\u201f \ndemands on suppliers have become the basis of a new set of workplace surveillance and \nhygienic practices, which allow retailers to \u201ecome clean\u201f in more than one sense: \u201ethey \ncan provide safer, greener, more certifiably ethical food, and boast in detail about it\u201f. \n \nIn addition, conventions and certificates themselves have become fetishised commodities \nin ways that are politically dangerous (Freidberg, 2003b). The majority of South African \nwine producers are not engaged with any form of ethical labelling scheme, but they are \naware of the power of labels on their products. Any label is likely to sell wine and \nproducers are now copying the style of ethical labelling. Representatives of both WIETA \nand FHA mention possible labelling schemes in the belief that consumers will respond \nfavourably. A wine industry executive suggests that retailers (specifically Waitrose) have \nheld preliminary discussions about ethical labelling (interview 21\/09\/06). However, \nconsumers are compelled increasingly to navigate the distinctions between products \nbranded as \u201eorganic\u2026, shade grown, sustainable, fair trade, fairly traded, or fair traded\u201f \n 41 \n(Fridell et al. 2008: 30), or ethically sourced, ethically traded and bio-friendly. The \ncreators of the labels have substantially more information about the actual production \nprocesses represented by the label than the consumers. The increasing complexity of \n\u201eethical\u201f wine production in South Africa threatens to obfuscate the realities of conditions \nfor workers and the potential impact of ethical initiatives, and to fetishise ethical \nlabelling. WIETA-compliant and fair-trade wine, which delivers some improvements for \nworkers and producer-communities (ref removed), thus becomes threatened as it \nstruggles to differentiate itself from the proliferation of \u201eethical\u201f, environmentally-\nfriendly and award-winning brands and competing labelling schemes. \n \nConclusions \nThis paper has sought to cast light on the complex ethical terrain of alternative trade and \nsocial and environmental certification in the Cape wine industry, and on the drivers \nbehind these. It has suggested that, despite internationally-respected schemes such as \nISO, WIETA and fair-trade, there is some opacity of auditing processes through which \nretailer and producer guarantees of labour standards, working environments and \nenvironmental protection are articulated. It has also highlighted the limited role currently \nplayed by the South African government in enforcing labour standards in the wine \nindustry through BEE legislation, since most wine farms are exempt. In the absence of \nlegislative requirements to transform the industry, social and environmental codes and \ncivic conventions are likely to remain of significance. However, greater interrogation is \nrequired of the differing meanings and outcomes of transformation, empowerment, and \nupliftment that are being deployed in the wine industry, the material realities of \n 42 \ncontestations between differing forms of ethical processes, and the issues raised for \nadvocacy groups about the best ways to engage consumer activism through campaigns.  \n \nThe different certification schemes within the wine industry face significant pressure \nfrom interests located in state agencies, dominant market players, and social and \nenvironmental interest groups, and their voluntary nature is thus diminished \n(Mutersbaugh et al., 2005). Certification becomes a site of social struggle over who \ndefines quality standards and how these become codified in conventions, who determines \ncertification practices through which qualities are ratified, and who controls commercial \nchannels through which certified goods are distributed to consumers. National and \nregional struggles are increasingly governed by transnational institutions (e.g. ISO) that \nhave contradictory goals of trade liberalisation and environmental conservation. It \nremains to be seen whether locally-based initiatives, such as WIETA and BWI, can \nmaintain sufficient distance and impetus to effect meaningful transformation in workers\u201f \nlives and sustainable production in the wine industry. Producers have very little power in \ncomparison with large retailers (ref removed; see also Freidberg, 2003a). Thus, \nrearranging commodity networks around social and environmental values does not \nnecessarily make them less exploitative.  \n \nCertification is a governance tool used by powerful actors in commodity networks to \ndiscipline less powerful actors by exerting \u201econtrol at a distance\u201f (Ponte and Gibbon, \n2005: 22). Transnational wine retailers dominate networks to \u201esubsume the social and \nenvironmental goals of certification under their profitable strategy of selling high \n 43 \nvolumes at low prices\u201f (Klooster, 2005: 415). There is thus a fundamental need to \nquestion the relationships of power in commodity networks and to challenge the \nassumption that markets can provide producers with the means to cover the costs of \nenvironmental and social improvements. In addition, certification schemes can \nmarginalise smaller producers (Klooster, 2005; Ponte, 2006). They are mechanisms of \nmarket entry and exclusion and a source of power for those who control them (Renard, \n2005). This is beginning to have an effect in the South African wine industry, with the \nvast majority of small producers struggling to compete with certified large estates. The \nonly way to counter this is through the development of approaches able to \u201eidentify and \nreflect the ethical values of the South, particularly of the marginalised people ethical \ntrade is intended to assist\u201f (Blowfield, 1999: 753). While third party locally-based \ncertifications like WIETA are less open to manipulation by powerful external actors, they \nare still embedded in political economies and power relations (DuPuis and Goodman, \n2005). Other actors within the wine industry, particularly large farmers, estates and cellar \nowners, can stymie efforts at change. Some observers (particularly within labour unions) \nhave also suggested that schemes such as FHA have been established to undermine more \ntransformative schemes like WIETA, and to give the impression of change whilst \nmaintaining the status quo. In addition, by externalising functions such as social and \nenvironmental sustainability, powerful retailers are able to pass on responsibility and \ncosts to producers while outsourcing \u201etrouble-solving\u201f; \u201eNorthern consumers and \ncorporations rarely foot the bill\u201f (Ponte, 2006: 48).  \n \n 44 \nThe radical potential of some social and environmental certification schemes in the wine \nindustry is threatened by expansion of the gap between elite, ethical discourses and the \nlived, moral experience of workers. In the South African wine industry, alternative trade \ninitiatives do not appear to be closing this gap. Multiple codes, standards and \ncertifications have yet to deliver material improvement in the lives and conditions of \nwork for most farm workers. Casualisation and use of labour brokers has, in fact, \nworsened conditions of labour on many farms (Bek et al. 2007). The implications of this \nare that while more research is required to understand the evolving complexities of \ncertification in the wine industry, more is also needed to investigate the lived experiences \nof farm workers within these regulatory contexts.  In particular, there is a need to \nunderstand farm workers\u201f own perceptions of the changing nature of labour relations, of \ntheir role (potential or actual) in certification regimes, and their own ethical \nunderstandings of social and environmental sustainability. \n 45 \nReferences: \nBarrientos S, Kritzinger A, Opondo M and Smith S.

Outlawed \nin 1961, the practice endured into the 1990s; crude sweet wine continues to be cheaply \navailable on wine farms (http:\/\/wine.wosa.co.za\/uk\/page_detail.aspx?PAGEID=130). \n2\n The Geneva-based NGO International Organisation for Standardisation comprises 157 \nmember countries and sets standards on a range of products and services \n(http:\/\/www.iso.org\/iso\/about.htm). HACCP is the main platform for international \nlegislation and good manufacturing practices for all sectors of the food industry. It forms \na key component of many certified compliance standards. It is a risk management tool \nthat identifies hazards affecting food safety and establishes control limits at critical points \nduring the production process (http:\/\/www.bsi-global.com\/en\/Assessment-and-\ncertification-services\/management-systems\/Standards-and-Schemes\/HACCP\/). \n3\n Research was conducted between April and September, supported by a British \nAcademy research grant (SG-43017). Most South African wine production is located in \nWestern Cape province. \n4\n In January 2009, WIETA was renamed Agricultural Ethical Trade Initiative \n(AETI(SA)) to reflect this broader remit and now has a new CEO (Anthea Flink, pers. \ncomm.. 30\/01\/09). \n5\n Some informants represent more than one stakeholder group. \n6\n Access to farm workers is extremely difficult and often impossible because of \nrestrictions imposed by farmers and increasing use of seasonal and temporary workers. \nWhen access is gained, workers are often reluctant to voice their opinions because of \nconcerns about job security. Therefore, while it was desirable to interview workers \nformally, the research was limited to formal interviews with union representatives and \n 52 \n                                                                                                                                                 \noff-farm informal interviews with labourers. Due to the politically and commercially \nsensitive nature of much of the information the identity of all sources is protected. \n7\n See http:\/\/www.ipw.co.za\/. For farms, these include conservation, soil and terrain, \ncultivars, vineyard layout, cultivation practices, nutrition, irrigation, crop management, \nintegrated pest management, handling of chemicals and record-keeping. For cellars, these \ninclude energy use and carbon emissions, maintaining equipment, SO2\n \nlevels, additives, \nfermentation, cooling, waste water management, disinfectants, management of solid \nwaste, noise and air pollution, packaging materials and bottling facilities. \n8\n Terroir describes the unique aspects of a place (climate, soil type, topography) that \ninfluence the quality of wine made from it. The concept underpins the French Appellation \nd'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC) system. Despite debate about its definition \u2013 especially \nwhether any human interference negates terroir and thus lessens the distinctions between \nOld World wines and the modern techniques of New World wines \u2013 and controversy over \nits level of influence in gauging quality (Robinson, 2006: 693-95), the AOC system is a \nmodel for international appellation and wine laws.  \n9\n See http:\/\/www.bwi.co.za. \n10\n Figures are accurate at the time of writing, based on WIETA statistics \n(www.WIETA.org.za\/qa.html). \n11\n Lesley Fillis, RUDNET CEO, quoted in a WOSA report, \n(http:\/\/www.wosa.co.za\/sa\/news_article.php?id=771)  \n12\n The 2003 Act contains the following definitions: \u201e\u201cblack people\u201d is a generic term \nwhich means Africans, Coloureds and Indians; \u201cbroad-based black economic \nempowerment\u201d means the economic empowerment of all black people including women, \n 53 \n                                                                                                                                                 \nworkers, youth, people with disabilities and people living in rural areas through diverse \nbut integrated socio-economic strategies that include, but are not limited to, (a) increasing \nthe number of black people that manage, own and control enterprises and productive \nassets; (b) facilitating ownership and management of enterprises and productive assets by \ncommunities, workers, cooperatives and other co1lective enterprises; (c) human resource \nand skills development; (d) achieving equitable representation in all occupational \ncategories and levels in the workforce: (e) preferential procurement; and (f) investment in \nenterprises that are owned or managed by black people\u201f. \n \n"}
