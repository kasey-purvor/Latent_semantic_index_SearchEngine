Introduction \nThis study comprises an overview of the potential for CO2\nInventories of estimated CO\n storage in four countries in the Indian subcontinent: India, \nPakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.  \n2 emissions from large point sources in the Indian subcontinent were compiled and used to update \nthe IEAGHG R&D Programme\u2019s Global CO2 Emissions Database, and then entered into a GIS, which was used to map the \nlocations of emission sources. Potential geological CO2 storage sites in coal fields, oil and gas fields and saline water-bearing \nreservoir rocks (saline aquifers) were then identified and where possible quantified. Sources and potential storage sites were then \noverlain in the GIS to visually match the CO2\nIt was not possible to quantify the saline aquifer CO\n sources and potential storage sites and draw conclusions about the potential for the \napplication of carbon dioxide capture and storage to reduce national emissions. \n2 storage potential of any of the four countries due to a lack of suitable \ngeological information (e.g. seismic and well data). Instead, the sedimentary basins of the four countries were divided into \ncategories of good, fair and limited saline aquifer CO2\n2. India \n storage potential on the basis of published geological data. Basins with \ngood potential contain hydrocarbon fields (proving at least local containment of buoyant fluids over geological timescales) and \nthere is expectation of good reservoir and seal quality at depths below 800 m over at least a significant part of the basin. Basins \nwith fair potential contain one or more potential regional seals, underlying reservoirs at depths >800 m, and potential structural \nclosures, but containment of buoyant fluids over geological timescales is not yet proven by the discovery of hydrocarbon fields. \nIn basins with perceived limited potential, porous and permeable reservoir are absent or not sealed, or the basins lack structural \nclosures, or are in structurally complex fold belts, or they face major potential conflicts of use. \n2.1. Industrial point sources of CO2\nTotal annual CO\n in India \n2 emissions in India are estimated to have been 1343 million tonnes (Mt) in 2004 \u2013 the latest year for which \ninformation is available from the United Nations Statistics Division [1]. During this study, which took place in 2006, annual CO2 \nemissions from large point sources in India are estimated to have been 721 Mt CO2\nMarland et al. [2] indicate that India\u2019s CO\n, i.e. about half total emissions.  \n2\nCoal-based power plants are the backbone of the Indian power sector and will continue to be the major source of electricity \ngeneration in the country for the foreseeable future. A major upcoming development in the Indian power sector is the Indian \nMinistry of Power\u2019s initiative for the development of coal-based Ultra-Mega Power Projects (UMPPs), each with a capacity of \n4,000 MW or above. In the first phase, nine sites have been identified by the Central Electricity Authority for UMPPs. These \ninclude four pithead sites and five coastal sites (Figure 1). These UMPPs will add some 257 Mt CO\n emissions are rising rapidly and they look set to continue to rise at increasing \nrates. For example, annual emissions from operational power plants in India are estimated to be 467 Mt whereas predicted annual \nemissions from planned power plants and plants under construction are estimated to be 653 Mt.  \n2\n2.2. Potential CO\n emissions and 36,000 MWe \ninstalled capacity at nine locations within 7-8 years. \n2\nThe CO\n storage sites in India \n2 storage potential of saline water-bearing reservoir rocks, oil and gas fields and coal fields were considered in the \nanalysis. The area of India north of the Himalayan mountain front was not analysed because it is geologically complex and was \nconsidered to have little practical CO2 storage potential. Figure 1 indicates that much of Peninsula India is unsuitable for CO2\nIndia has the fourth largest recoverable coal reserves in the world. However, much of this coal is easily mined and will be \nused as fuel. This means that the potential for CO\n \nstorage because basalt or crystalline basement rocks occur at the surface. It is possible that sedimentary rocks may occur beneath \nthe basalt in some areas but imaging problems would probably prevent effective site characterisation and monitoring. \n2 storage on coal at depths above 1200 m could be severely constrained. An \nindicative calculation for IEAGHG [3] suggests that the potential could be of the order of 345 Mt CO2 nationally in the major \ncoalfields, and none of the coalfields are estimated to have the capacity to store >100 Mt CO2. If CO2\nOil and gas fields occur in three areas: Assam and the Assam-Arakan Fold Belt, the Krishna-Godavari and Cauvery Basins, \nand the Mumbai\/Cambay\/Barmer\/Jaisalmer basin area. The total storage capacity in oil and gas fields is estimated to be between \n3.7 and 4.6 x 109 t CO\n storage on coal proves \npractical at depths >1200 m the very large resource present at depth, e.g. in the Cambay Basin and down dip to the east of the \nRajmahal coalfields, could be brought into play. This is an area that requires further investigation. \n2. Many Indian oil and gas fields are relatively small in CO2 storage terms. Only a few fields, e.g. the \nBombay High field, offshore Mumbai, are thought to have ample storage capacity for the lifetime emissions of a medium sized \ncoal-fired power plant. However, some of the recent offshore gas discoveries may have potential as CO2 storage sites in the \nfuture. It is also clear from Kumar et al. [4] that there are opportunities for enhanced oil recovery using CO2\nIt is thought likely that there is significant CO\n. \n2 potential in the saline water-bearing sedimentary rocks in the oil- and gas-\nbearing sedimentary basins around the margins of the peninsula, especially in the offshore basins, but also onshore in the states \nof Gujarat and Rajasthan. However, CO2 sources in the centre of the peninsula are poorly placed with respect to potential CO2 \nstorage sites unless the Gondwana basins in which the coalfields, and thus many of the pithead power plants, are found can be \ndemonstrated to have good potential, as indicated by Mondal [5]. There may also be saline aquifer CO2 storage potential in \nAssam and possibly in Cachar, Tripura and Mizoram, although this is distant from most of the main emission sources in India, \nespecially if any pipelines from the major CO2 sources did not cross Bangladesh. In this study, the Ganga Basin, which lies \nbeneath the Ganges plain, was considered to have limited CO2 storage potential because of the potential conflict of interest with \nthe use of (relatively shallow) groundwater for potable water supply and agriculture. This classification might be considered \ncontentious but it is a factor that needs to be considered in assessing CO2\nSingh et al. [6] indicate that basalt formations might have good storage potential in India in the future, but because the storage \nof CO\n storage capacity in the water-bearing reservoir rocks of \nonshore India in general. \n2 in basalt formations, by reaction of basic aluminosilicate minerals with injected CO2\n2.3. Matching CO\n, is considered to be an immature \ntechnology at present, it is not considered further here. Nevertheless, development of this concept into a mature technology \nwould potentially be beneficial to India: large areas of the country are covered by basalt (Figure 1).  \n2 sources and potential CO2\nFigure 1 shows the geographical relationship between the major existing and planned sources of CO\n storage sites in India \n2\nIt may be seen that sources in the NW of peninsula India and along the SE coast have good nearby storage potential, whereas \nthose in SE, Central and, in this analysis northern India, do not. The good potential in NE India, in Assam and the Assam-Arakan \nFold Belt, appears to be stranded relative to most of the major sources. \n in India and areas \ncontaining the sedimentary basins considered on the basis of this first-pass assessment to have good, fair and limited storage \npotential. The basins rated as good are the hydrocarbon-bearing basins, so they also contain all the potential in oil and gas fields.  \nThe calculations in the IEAGHG CO2 sources inventory indicate that each individual UMPP may have annual emissions of \nbetween 28 and 29 Mt CO2. If they have a 35 year lifetime they are each likely to emit approximately 1 Gt CO2, and send \nsignificantly more CO2 for storage if fitted for CO2 capture. We estimate that the total storage capacity of India\u2019s major coal \nfields and oil and gas fields is <5 Gt CO2, and none of the fields have the capacity to store the lifetime emissions of a single \nUMPP. As there is insufficient storage capacity in oil and gas fields and coal fields to make significant inroads into India\u2019s \ncurrent and future emissions, it is clear that there is a need to quantify the realistic saline aquifer CO2 storage capacity of India\u2019s \nsedimentary basins. This would require the use of oil and gas exploration data and might best be approached on a basin-by-basin \nbasis, starting with the most strategically placed basins, as it is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. If the saline \naquifers are found wanting, export of CO2\n \n by ship, perhaps to the Middle East, would be the only remaining alternative for CCS \nin India, unless the basalt storage concept can be advanced into a mature technological option.  \nFigure 1 Geographical relationship between existing and planned CO2 sources and sedimentary basins in India \n3. Pakistan \n3.1. Industrial point sources of CO2\nPakistan\u2019s total annual CO\n in Pakistan \n2 emissions are estimated to have been 126 Mt in 2004 [1]. Annual CO2 emissions from large point \nsources were estimated in this study to have been approximately 45 Mt CO2\n3.2. Potential geological CO\n, just over half of which comes from the power \nsector. \n2\nBased on reserve estimates provided by Kazmi and Jan [7], the total storage capacity in oil and gas fields in Pakistan is \nestimated to be approximately 1.7 Gt CO\n storage sites in Pakistan \n2. Four of the gas fields (Sui, Mari, Qadirpur and Uch) are estimated to have the \npotential to store >200 Mt CO2, but none of the oil fields are thought to have significant storage capacity (10 Mt or more). None \nof Pakistan\u2019s coal fields are thought to have potential as CO2 storage sites as, with the exception of Thar, they are all shallow and \nactively mined. The saline aquifers in the Kohat-Potwar Basin and Indus Basin are considered likely to have good CO2\n3.3.

There is a very good match between sedimentary basins with perceived good saline aquifer \nstorage capacity and CO2\nGiven that the estimated gas field CO\n sources.  \n2 storage capacity alone is of the order of 35 times larger than the current annual \nemissions of CO2\n \n from large point sources, it appears that Pakistan is well placed to deploy carbon dioxide capture and storage \ntechnology.  \nFigure 2 Storage potential and CO2 sources in Pakistan \n4. Bangladesh \n4.1. Industrial point sources of CO2\nBangladesh\u2019s total annual CO\n emissions in Bangladesh \n2 emissions are estimated to have been 37 Mt in 2004 [1]. Total CO2 emissions from large point \nsources are estimated to amount to some 17 Mt CO2\n4.2. Potential geological CO\n, of which over 15 Mt are produced by the electrical power generation sector \n2\nThere are no oil fields in Bangladesh although there is minor production of condensate and light oil from some of the gas \nfields. Fourteen of the gas fields have estimated CO\n storage sites in Bangladesh \n2 storage capacities >10 Mt. Two have estimated CO2 storage capacities \n>200 Mt. Norman [8] and Holloway and Baily [9] discuss Bangladesh\u2019s three concealed coalfields: Jamalganj, Khalaspir and \nBarapukuria. All are in the NW of the country, west of the Jamuna river. The only field that has been exploited to date is \nBarapukuria, which is being mined at present. Additionally, coal has been discovered in a borehole at Dighipara, at a depth of \nabout 328 m. None of these fields are sufficiently large to be of interest for CO2 storage. The greater part of Bangladesh lies in \nthe eastern part of the Bengal Basin (Figure 10). The Bengal Basin becomes progressively more folded to the east and eventually \nmerges into the Assam-Arakan fold belt, which occurs in the Chittagong Hill tracts of eastern Bangladesh. The eastern, folded, \nhalf of the Bengal basin in eastern Bangladesh has excellent CO2 storage potential in the many anticlines that are found there. \nThere is also likely to be potential in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, although this region is remote from many large point sources \nand may suffer from overpressure, at least locally. The western half of Bangladesh, west of the Jamuna river, suffers from a lack \nof large structural closures suitable for containing geologically stored CO2\n4.3. Matching CO\n, and so may have less storage potential. \n2 sources and potential CO2\nGiven that the estimated gas field CO\n storage sites in Bangladesh \n2 storage capacity alone is of the order of 65 times larger than the current annual \nemissions of CO2\n \n from large point sources, it can be stated with certainty that Bangladesh is well placed to take advantage of \ncarbon dioxide capture and storage technology should it be required in the future. \nFigure 3 CO2 sources and potential storage sites in Bangladesh \n5. Sri Lanka \n5.1. Industrial point sources of CO2\nSri Lanka\u2019s total annual CO\n emissions in Sri Lanka \n2 emissions are estimated to have been 11.53 Mt in 2004. The total annual emissions of CO2\n5.2. Potential geological CO\n from \nlarge point sources in Sri Lanka are very small, and estimated to be approximately 2.6 Mt. They derive mainly from 6 oil-fired \npower plants, a refinery and a cement plant. They will be increased by the operation of new coal-fired power plant, but national \nemissions will still be very small in global terms. \n2\nGeologically, most of onshore Sri Lanka is made up of Precambrian crystalline rocks with no CO\n storage sites in Sri Lanka \n2\nThere are no significant coal deposits known in Sri Lanka. No oil fields or gas fields have been discovered to date, but there is \noil and gas potential in the Sri Lankan side of the Cauvery Basin, offshore to the north of the island, in Palk Bay and the Gulf of \nMannar. There may be some saline aquifer CO\n storage potential. The only \nsignificant development of sedimentary rocks onshore is along the NW coast, where Miocene limestones overlie the Precambrian \nbasement. \n2\n5.3. Matching CO\n storage capacity in this area as well, but it cannot be quantified at present. \n2 sources and potential geological CO2\nThe only potential geological CO\n storage sites in Sri Lanka \n2 storage sites are offshore to the N and W of the island. The storage capacity in this area \ncannot be quantified at present, so no estimate of the storage potential relative to national emissions from large point sources can \nbe made. However, the new coal-fired power plant under construction at Norochcholai is relatively well placed with respect to \nthe inferred CO2\n \n storage potential in the Cauvery Basin. \nFigure 4 CO2 sources and potential storage sites in Sri Lanka \n6. Conclusions \nIt is concluded that the CO2\n7.
