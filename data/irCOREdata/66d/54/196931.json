Introduction\n[2] The appearance of sporadic E (Es) can have a\nnumber of effects on the propagation of radio signals in\nthe HF and VHF bands. For example, in the HF band,\nsporadic E layers of sufficient intensity can prevent the\nsignal reflecting from the F region (i.e., \u201cblanketing\u201d)\nthereby shortening the propagation range. At VHF, Es\ncan enable oblique reflection at frequencies up to around\n100 MHz, leading to problems with interference from\ncochannel transmitters located at ranges well beyond the\nline of sight. The appearance of sporadic E at midlati-\ntudes follows some well\u2010defined seasonal and diurnal\nvariations [see Whitehead, 1989] with a strong maximum\nin the probability of occurrence (PEs) in the summer\nmonths and a secondary maximum in winter and a peak\nduring the day with a minimum in the hours before\nsunrise. PEs has also been mapped as a function of lat-\nitude and longitude (although the polar latitudes are not\ncovered) [Smith, 1978], work that has been incorporated\nin an International Telecommunication Union Radio-\ncommunication Sector (ITU\u2010R) recommendation [ITU\u2010R,\n1999]. There is inconclusive evidence whether longer\nperiodicities, such as the sunspot cycle, are present with\nsome studies showing a positive correlation between PEs\nand sunspot number (particularly at high latitudes), some\nnegative (particularly at midlatitudes) and some no cor-\nrelation (e.g., see Bradley [2003] and Whitehead [1989]\nfor reviews of a number of studies). Recent work\n[Maksyutin and Sherstyukov, 2005] has suggested that\nthe dependencies are complex, since the correlation of\nPEs with sunspot number was dependent on time of day\n(positive correlation during the day, negative at night)\nand the Es critical frequency (positive for foEs = 3\u20134MHz\nand negative for 6\u20137 MHz). Stocker and Warrington\n[2009] compared nighttime PEs observed on obliquely\npropagating HF radio waves at sunspot maximum and\nminimum (the sunspot maximum data set is used in the\ncurrent paper) and found that PEs was greater at sun-\nspot minimum which is consistent with the results of\nMaksyutin and Sherstyukov [2005]. It is also unclear\nfrom previous studies what effect geomagnetic activity\nhas on sporadic E since both positive and negative cor-\nrelations of occurrence and intensity with geomagnetic\nactivity have been found. For example,Whitehead [1989]\nreviewed a number of, largely low and midlatitude,\nstudies and concluded, \u201cmagnetic activity does not have\nmuch influence on sporadic E.\u201d However, Maksyutin and\nSherstyukov [2005] found a seasonal dependence of the\nresponse of midlatitude Es to geomagnetic disturbances\nwith a strong (\u223c20%) decrease in the critical frequency in\nsummer and winter, and a weak increase in autumn. They\nattributed the difference in behavior to a change in the ion\ncomposition of the sporadic E layer with season.\n[3] The midlatitude trough is a nighttime region where\nthe electron density is reduced by a factor of 2 or 3, and\nforms a boundary between the midlatitude and auroral\nionospheres. While there are many studies that have\ninvestigated sporadic E at midlatitudes, there have been,\nby comparison, few that have focused on the subauroral\nregion (e.g., in the vicinity of the midlatitude trough).\nRodger et al. [1983] found that sporadic E was com-\nmonly observed under both poleward and equatorward\nedges of the trough (slightly more often on the poleward\nedge) with the type observed being different before and\n1Department of Engineering, University of Leicester, Leicester,\nUK.\nCopyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0048\u20106604\/11\/2010RS004507\nRADIO SCIENCE, VOL. 46, RS2002, doi:10.1029\/2010RS004507, 2011\nRS2002 1 of 11\nafter magnetic midnight. Retardation, Esr, i.e., where the\nvirtual height of the ionogram trace increases toward the\ncritical frequency, was observed before magnetic mid-\nnight, while flat, Esf, i.e., where no increase in virtual\nheight with frequency exists, was observed afterward.\nZherebtsov et al. [1996] found that in the trough region\nEsr tended to occur at or just after a minimum in auroral\nactivity (as indicated by the AE index).\n[4] While the majority of the studies discussed above\nhave used vertical sounding methods, in this paper\nobservations of the effect of Es on obliquely propagating\nHF signals are presented. In particular, as well as deter-\nmining the probability of occurrence of Es, the effects on\nthe characteristics of the reflected HF radio signal, i.e., the\ndistribution of angles of arrival and the spreads in delay,\nangle of arrival, and Doppler frequency are investigated.\nSince propagation via Es is common at high and sub-\nauroral latitudes, an understanding of the HF signal\ncharacteristics for these modes is important for those\nwho design and operate systems in these regions (e.g.,\ncommercial airlines and shipping).\n2. Observations\n[5] The experimental arrangement has been described\nin detail elsewhere [e.g., Siddle et al., 2004] so only a\nbrief overview will be given here. A transmitter located\nin Uppsala (see Figure 1) radiated a 100 W, Barker coded\nBPSK signal on six frequencies in the lower HF band\n(from 4.6 to 18.4 MHz). These signals were received at a\nsite approximately 15 km south of Leicester using a six\u2010\nchannel superresolution DF system. This system was\ncapable of measuring the amplitude and direction of\narrival as a function of absolute time of flight (TOF) and\nDoppler frequency. From these observations, signal\nparameters such as the delay spread, angular spread, and\nDoppler spread could then be derived. The system\noperated from September 2000 until January 2002. An\nexample interval of observations of the TOF and azimuth\nas a function of time is presented in Figure 2 where\npropagation modes identified as being via the E region\nare indicated. Unfortunately, propagation from the spo-\nradic E and the normal (i.e., solar\u2010controlled) E layers\ncannot be distinguished by these observations, hence the\nrestriction in this paper to nighttime events, when the\ncritical frequency of the normal E region will generally\nbe too low to support oblique reflection even at the\nlowest of the frequencies employed. There are several\nnoteworthy features of the observations presented in\nFigure 2. First, while propagation via Es occurs on both\nthe nights shown here, no E region propagation is\nobserved during the day because D region absorption and\na low elevation angle (and hence relatively poor antenna\nperformance) lead to the signal at this frequency being too\nFigure 1. Map illustrating the position of the transmitter and receiver sites in relation to the mid-\nlatitude trough [Halcrow and Nisbet, 1977] and auroral oval for (left) Kp = 4 and (right) Kp = 8. The\nlocations of the trough walls are indicated by the two pairs of lines, while the auroral oval is marked\nby the shaded region. Note that in Figure 1 (right), the oval is shown for Kp = 5 since the model\nused [Holzworth and Meng, 1975] is not valid for higher values.\nSTOCKER AND WARRINGTON: NIGHTTIME SPORADIC E MEASUREMENTS RS2002RS2002\n2 of 11\nweak to be detected. Second, at the start of 21 November\n(day 325) the signal is simultaneously received via both\nthe F region and the E region. However, the F region\nsignal arrives from 30\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 north of the great circle\ndirection (46\u00b0), while the E region signal is received on\ngreat circle. This off\u2010great circle propagation, which has\nbeen characterized in a number of papers [e.g., Stocker\net al., 2009], is predominantly an F region effect and\nis rarely significant for signals reflected from the E region.\nThird, it is apparent that the observed azimuthal variation\nis greater for signals propagated via the F region than it is\nfor those reflected from Es.\n2.1. Es Occurrence Statistics\n[6] The percentage occurrence of signals identified as\nhaving been propagated at night (sunset to sunrise at an\naltitude of 100 km) via Es layers, together with the ITU\npredictions [ITU\u2010R, 1999], has been plotted as a function\nof equivalent vertical frequency (foEs) for the different\nseasons in Figure 3. The oblique frequencies used in the\nexperiment have been converted to the equivalent vertical\nfrequency by dividing them by 5 corresponding to an Es\nheight of approximately 105 km (the exact value depends\non the precise height of the Es layer, values vary from 4.7\nat 110 km to 5.2 at 100 km). The predicted values have\nbeen found by first finding the percentage of time for\nwhich foEs > 7 MHz at the midpoint of the Uppsala\u2010\nLeicester path using the appropriate map given by ITU\u2010R\n[1999]. This value is then used to scale the frequency\ndependent probabilities for Europe (i.e., region A of\nITU\u2010R [1999]). The nighttime lines have been deter-\nmined by applying a correction to the all\u2010day lines (fnight\/\nfallday) where fnight and fallday are, respectively, the mean\nnighttime and all\u2010day values of foEs (at 0.1% of the time)\nderived from the appropriate diurnal variation curves\ngiven by ITU\u2010R [1999]. While a nighttime line cannot be\ncalculated for the entire year (since there is no diurnal\ninformation for this case in the work of ITU\u2010R [1999]),\nthe offset from the all\u2010day line must lie between the\nsummer, and winter and equinox extremes. When the\nobservations for the entire year are included in deter-\nmining PEs, the upper four frequencies (10.4\u201318.4 MHz)\nfollow the Phillips law (i.e., log p = a + bf, where p is the\nprobability of occurrence of foEs > f, f is frequency in\nMHz, and a and b are constants) [see Bradley, 2003;\nITU\u2010R, 1999], but are significantly below the value given\nby the ITU\u2010R model. However, the results for the lowest\ntwo frequencies (4.64 and 6.95 MHz) do not follow the\nPhillips law because of an instrumental effect as follows.\nAt these frequencies, 4.64 MHz in particular, propagation\nvia the F region is often observed for a substantial por-\ntion of the night. Since the system is capable of resolving\nonly those multiple modes that are separated in TOF by\nmore than approximately 0.5 ms (i.e., the transmitted\npulse width) and that have signal strengths within about\n15 dB of each other, if the F region mode is stronger than\nE region mode by more than this amount, the latter will\nnot be detected. For winter and equinox the behavior is\nlargely similar to that for the entire year, with the upper\nfour frequencies obeying the Phillips rule, although in the\ncase of equinox, PEs derived from the observations is\nFigure 2. (top) Time of flight (delay) and (bottom) azimuth versus time (UT) for an interval in\nwinter 2001 (20\u201322 November) for 6.95 MHz. The gray boxes in the Figure 2 (top) indicate the\npropagation modes identified as being reflected from sporadic E.\nSTOCKER AND WARRINGTON: NIGHTTIME SPORADIC E MEASUREMENTS RS2002RS2002\n3 of 11\nslightly higher than that predicted. For the summer, there\nare fewer observations (because the nighttime interval is\nsubstantially reduced) and propagation via the F region is\nmore common at all except the highest two frequencies\nleading to a significant underreporting of the presence of\nsporadic E.\n[7] PEs for 2001 is presented as a function of magnetic\nactivity (as represented by the Kp index) in Table 1. From\nTable 1 it is apparent that the behavior is similar at low\n(i.e., Kp < 3) and moderately disturbed levels of magnetic\nactivity (i.e., 3 \u2264 Kp < 6), except for a slightly steeper\nnegative gradient with frequency (for frequencies of\n10.39 MHz and higher) in the latter case. Although\nperiods of high levels of magnetic activity (i.e., Kp \u2265 6) are\ncomparatively rare (just under 3% of the observations),\nit is clear that that the occurrence of sporadic E is sig-\nnificantly more frequent during these intervals (except\nat 4.64 MHz). This behavior can be explained by the\nexpansion of the polar cap when Kp is high, which in turn\nleads to the auroral oval and the poleward edge of the\ntrough moving sufficiently far equatorward to lie close to\nthe path midpoint (see Figure 1). Work undertaken in the\nsouthern hemisphere [Rodger et al., 1983] also found that\nEs was slightly more prevalent under the poleward edge\nof the trough than the equatorward edge.\n2.2. Direction of Arrival\n[8] The distribution of azimuths at each frequency for\nall observations of nighttime Es is presented in Figure 4.\nThe peak of the azimuth distribution tends to be centered\non the great circle direction (\u223c46\u00b0) for all frequencies,\nwhile the variation in azimuth tends to decrease with\nincreasing frequency. The two peaks in the distribution\nthat occur for the higher frequencies, the main one, as\nstated above, close to the great circle direction with a\nsmaller one 2\u00b0 to the north arise from the resolution in\nazimuth (2\u00b0) employed in generating the steering vectors\nfor the antenna array. This azimuth resolution represents a\ncompromise between precision and computation time (the\nlatter is particularly important since bearings are obtained\nfor each TOF and Doppler in the channel scattering\nfunction for which the signal is observed; see section 2.3\nof Warrington et al. [2000] for more details). Although\nan interpolation function is used, the resultant bearings\ntend to cluster around the 2\u00b0 intervals particularly for the\nFigure 3.

The observations are marked by pluses, while the solid and dashed lines give\npredictions for the appropriate season from the ITU\u2010Rmodel [ITU\u2010R, 1999] for all day and nighttime\nonly, respectively.\nTable 1.

Since the principal aim of the experiment\nwas to study large off great circle effects [e.g., see Stocker\net al., 2009] this resolution was usually satisfactory.\n[9] The mean azimuth and elevation of arrival for\nvarying levels of Kp are presented in Table 2. For low\nand medium values of Kp, the azimuth is close to the\nnominal great circle direction (46\u00b0) while at high Kp at\nfrequencies in the range 10.39\u201314.36 MHz, the azimuth\nis deviated to the north of the great circle by about 1\u00b0. At\nthe same time, for all frequencies except 18.38 MHz, the\nelevation decreases by about 3\u00b0\u20134\u00b0 as Kp increases from\nlow to high levels. Although not shown in Table 2, these\nchanges are accompanied by a small increase in mean\nTOF (less than the resolution of 0.05 ms) at the highest\nband of Kp. Assuming specular reflection, these small\nchanges in TOF, azimuth, and elevation with increasing\nKp are consistent with the location of the reflection point\nmoving away from midpoint toward the transmitter,\nmoving slightly northward of the great circle and the\nheight of the Es layer increasing (see Figure 5). As\ndescribed in section 2.1, when Kp increases, the polar cap\nexpands and the poleward edge of the trough and auroral\noval lie close to the path midpoint, potentially changing\nthe generation mechanism and location and character of\nthe observed Es from midlatitude to auroral.\n[10] Although there is a strong seasonal dependence of\nPEs (see section 2.1), there is no significant systematic\neffect of season on the directions of arrival, except that\nthe mean elevation for frequencies of 11.12 MHz and\nless is approximately 2\u00b0 higher in winter than in summer\nor at the equinoxes. Since there is no change in the time\nof flight, assuming specular reflection, this means that the\nreflection point is closer to the receiver and the reflection\nheight is lower in winter (by approximately 8 km at\n10.39 MHz) and there may be a tilt in the Es layer.\n2.3. Signal Spreading\n[11] An example of the observed channel scattering\nfunction, i.e., the signal power, azimuth, and elevation as\na function of time delay and Doppler frequency is given\nin Figure 6. It should be noted that there was a small\ndifference in the frequency references at the transmitter\nand receiver and this accounts for most of the 2 Hz\ndeviation of the signal from zero Doppler. The signal\npower as a function of azimuth and elevation for the\nsame observation presented in Figure 6, excluding the\nsignal reflected from the F region (i.e., that at a TOF of\n\u223c6 ms), is given in Figure 7. In this example, there is\nsome evidence indicating the presence of fine structure\nwithin the Es reflection with two peaks in the azimuth\ndistribution separated by 1\u00b0\u20132\u00b0. While it is possible that\nthis fine structure results from the angular resolution of\nthe steering vectors (i.e., 2\u00b0 in azimuth, as explained in\nsection 2.2), previous work [Sherrill and Smith, 1977;\nMinullin, 1986] has also found evidence of similar\nstructure. While the range of elevations from which the\nsignal is observed to arrive is considerably larger than\nthat observed by Clarke and Tibble [1978], the resolution\nof the Doppler measurements (0.5 Hz) was insufficient to\ndetect the multiple signal components observed by these\nauthors. Following the methods of Angling et al. [1998],\nFigure 4.

For this particular example, the spreads are 0.02 ms,\n1.3 Hz, 4\u00b0, and 6\u00b0, respectively, putting it into the highest\n5% of azimuth spreads observed at 6.95 MHz. The\nmedian and 95th percentile values of the spreads found\nfor all Es observations in 2001 have been plotted as a\nfunction of frequency in Figure 8. In contrast to the\nresults of Warrington and Stocker [2003], the Doppler\nspread at the 95th percentile increases with increasing\nfrequency, although it should be noted that in the earlier\npaper reflections from all modes were considered, whereas\nin the current work only reflections from Es layers are\nincluded in the statistics. The delay spread (corrected for\nthe transmitted pulse width) is largely independent of\nfrequency, a result that might be expected since generally\nsporadic E layers are relatively thin. The azimuth and\nelevation spreads decrease with increasing frequency.\nTable 2.

While these\nsizes are quite large, they are not entirely inconsistent with\nprevious observations of the horizontal extent of Es at mid\nand low latitudes [e.g., Whitehead, 1989]. However, par-\nticularly for the lower frequencies (4.64 and 6.95 MHz)\nit is possible that both 1\u2010hop and 2\u2010hop Es modes are\npresent (the TOF for these modes are not distinguishable\nin the observations) and that this then results in the larger\nelevation spreads.\n[12] The mean azimuth, elevation, and Doppler spread\nas a function of frequency for two different ranges of Kp\n(low and high) are given in Figure 9 (note delay spread is\nomitted since it does not change with Kp). As expected, at\nlow Kp the behavior of the mean spreads is similar to that\nof the median values presented in Figure 8. At high Kp,\nthe spreads are all higher (except elevation spread at\n4.64 MHz) than at low Kp, this being particularly marked\nfor the azimuth and Doppler spread at the highest two\nfrequencies. At the high values of Kp the signal is\nreflected from locations close to or poleward of the\ntrough boundary and therefore propagation is likely to be\nstrongly affected by the presence of irregularities in the\ntrough wall or auroral oval which lead to increases in the\nazimuth, elevation, and Doppler spreads.\n3. Concluding Remarks\n[13] Observations of some of the signal parameters of a\nsignal obliquely reflected from sporadic E, together with\nthe probability of occurrence of sporadic E (PEs), for a\nyear close to sunspot maximum have been presented. The\ngeometry of the path is interesting, since it lies along the\nmidlatitude trough and the character of the propagation\nchanges with geomagnetic activity as the path changes\nfrom essentially midlatitude to auroral. The results can be\nsummarized as follows:\n[14] 1. With the exception of those obtained during\nequinox, the values of PEs are generally lower than the\nITU\u2010R predictions even when these are adjusted to cover\nFigure 7. Signal power (in linear units) as a function of (top) azimuth and (bottom) elevation for\nthe same example as Figure 6.\nSTOCKER AND WARRINGTON: NIGHTTIME SPORADIC E MEASUREMENTS RS2002RS2002\n8 of 11\nthe nighttime only. It is interesting to note that mea-\nsurements of PEs taken on the same path in 2007 (close\nto the recent sunspot minimum) have tended to be higher\nthan the predictions [Stocker and Warrington, 2009].\nHowever, the relatively small observing intervals (i.e.,\nonly 2 years, 2001 and 2007) make it difficult to be\ncertain whether this is a solar cycle effect or part of a\nlonger\u2010term trend (see Whitehead [1989] for a discussion\nof solar cycle effects).\n[15] 2. PEs increased significantly during highly dis-\nturbed conditions (i.e., when Kp \u2265 6).\n[16] 3. Measurements of the direction of arrival indi-\ncate that propagation is largely on great circle, although\nthere is a small deviation (1\u00b0) to the north when Kp is\nvery high. The elevation is strongly affected by Kp,\ndecreasing by 3\u00b0\u20134\u00b0 during very disturbed conditions.\nSince the TOF remains fixed, this implies an increase of\nEs height, a northward move in the reflection point and a\npossible tilt in the Es layer.\n[17] 4. The spreads in azimuth, elevation and Doppler\nall increase during disturbed conditions because of scat-\ntering from the irregularities present in the poleward wall\nof the trough or in the auroral oval. The latter parameter\nis particularly important for communication systems\nsince, depending on the modulation type employed, it\ncan have a significant effect on the achievable data rate\n[e.g., Angling et al., 1998]. However, the Doppler spread\nis significantly lower for the Es layer alone than when all\nionospheric modes (i.e., the various F region modes) are\nincluded [Warrington and Stocker, 2003].\n[18] From the radio communications perspective, the\nchannel scattering properties of signals reflected via\nnighttime Es can be significantly better than those\nreflected by the F region (e.g., the delay and Doppler\nspreads are, in general, reduced). So, operators of HF\nradio systems on subauroral paths under disturbed mag-\nnetic conditions or at high latitudes where the incidence\nof blanketing Es layers is common [e.g., Ritchie and\nFigure 8.
