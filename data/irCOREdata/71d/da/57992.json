Consequently, rock units 27 \nare often mapped at coarse-scales, resulting in lithological maps that have generalised contacts 28 \nwhich in many cases are inaccurately located.

In addition, a separate map of 44 \nclassification uncertainty highlights potential follow-up targets for ground-based verification. 45 \nThe results of this study demonstrate the significant potential of airborne LiDAR for lithological 46 \nPage 3 of 37 \n \ndiscrimination and rapid generation of detailed lithological maps, as a contribution to 47 \nconventional geological mapping programmes. 48 \n  49 \nPage 4 of 37 \n \n1. Introduction 50 \nGeological mapping is traditionally carried out by employing field strategies that are best 51 \nsuited to a specific area, including following azimuthal traverses, cross-strike transects, stream 52 \nsections, ridgetops, bedrock contacts, or moving between individual isolated outcrops (Barnes & 53 \nLisle, 2004). However, field mapping in complex and poorly accessible terrain can be 54 \nchallenging, time-consuming and costly (Gad & Kusky, 2007; Grunsky et al., 2009; Rogge et al., 55 \n2009). As a consequence, lithologies are often mapped coarsely at reconnaissance (e.g., 56 \n1:250,000) or more local scales (e.g., 1:40,000), potentially resulting in geological 57 \nsimplifications and inaccuracies (Roy et al., 2009).  58 \nRemote sensing data including aerial photographs, and multi- and hyperspectral imagery 59 \nare also used for lithological mapping (e.g., Drury, 1987; Rothery, 1987; Van der Meer et al., 60 \n1997; Rowan & Mars, 2003; Bedini, 2009; Roy et al., 2009). One of the primary benefits of 61 \nusing remote sensing data for lithological mapping is the ability to map areas that are poorly 62 \naccessible in the field. Although high-resolution aerial photographs can be manually interpreted 63 \nto help produce detailed lithological maps, the visual discrimination and mapping of surface 64 \nmaterials can be subjective, difficult and time-consuming (Crouvi et al., 2006). Multi- and 65 \nhyperspectral imagery can be automatically classified to rapidly generate lithological maps over 66 \nlarge areas, but spatial and spectral limitations of the data may affect the ability to resolve small 67 \noutcrops or discriminate units with similar spectral properties (Rowan & Mars, 2003; Dong & 68 \nLeblon, 2004). Dense vegetation cover, such as forests, can also be a hindrance to both field and 69 \nremote sensing mapping techniques. Whilst making field mapping logistically difficult, dense 70 \nvegetation also obscures the ground surface and conceals some of the terrain attributes required 71 \nPage 5 of 37 \n \nfor photogeological mapping. Additionally, dense vegetation may also obstruct or completely 72 \nmask the spectral signature of the underlying substrate (Carranza & Hale, 2002).  73 \n Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) is an emerging active remote sensing 74 \ntechnique. It offers a potential solution for overcoming the obscuring effects that dense 75 \nvegetation has on discrimination of ground materials, as it has the capability of acquiring 76 \naccurate and high-resolution (ca. 1\u20134 m) topographic data, even through forest cover (Kraus & 77 \nPfeifer, 1998). This is important because individual rock and soil types respond differently to 78 \nsurface processes, such as weathering and erosion, based on their combined mineralogical, 79 \npetrological and textural characteristics, and thus they typically have distinct topographic 80 \ncharacteristics (K\u00fchni & Pfiffner, 2001; Belt & Paxton, 2005). Laser reflections (or returns) from 81 \nthe ground can be separated from vegetation returns to virtually deforest the terrain, enabling the 82 \ngeneration of digital terrain models (DTMs; Haugerud & Harding, 2001). The ability to identify 83 \nsubtle topographic features in high-resolution DTMs makes LiDAR an important tool for 84 \ngeosciences research in both vegetated and non-vegetated terrain. Previous geological 85 \napplications of airborne LiDAR include fault mapping (Harding & Berghoff, 2000; Haugerud et 86 \nal., 2003; Prentice et al., 2003; Cunningham et al., 2006), mapping and characterisation of 87 \nlandslide morphology (McKean & Roering, 2004; Glenn et al., 2006; ) and the characterisation 88 \nof alluvial fan morphology (Staley et al., 2006; Frankel & Dolan, 2007). 89 \n Lithological mapping using topographic data is highly dependent upon the recognition of 90 \ndifferences in the topographic characteristics between lithologies. Despite its potential for 91 \ndetecting subtle topographic features in vegetated terrain, few studies have assessed the use of 92 \nairborne LiDAR for lithological mapping. Webster et al. (2006a, 2006b) visually identified 93 \nsubtle topographic differences in a LiDAR-derived DTM and used these to help map three basalt 94 \nPage 6 of 37 \n \nflow units in Nova Scotia, Canada. In comparison to other sources of topographic data, only the 95 \nLiDAR DTM had the resolution required to identify the subtle contacts between the units. 96 \nWallace (2005) quantitatively discriminated three distinct lithological units in the Sudbury Basin, 97 \nOntario, Canada, using elevation and morphometric variables of slope and plan, profile, 98 \nminimum and maximum curvatures derived from a LiDAR DTM. Several lithological maps 99 \nwere also generated through the classification of elevation and slope using a number of 100 \nconventional classifiers, including the Maximum Likelihood Classification algorithm. In the 101 \nsame study area, Wallace et al. (2006) used fractal dimension analysis to discriminate three 102 \nlithological units according to differences in topographic roughness. These studies demonstrate 103 \nthe potential of airborne LiDAR for both qualitative and quantitative lithological discrimination 104 \nand mapping in areas with relatively simple lithological distributions. The use of airborne 105 \nLiDAR for mapping in more geologically complex terrain, where the spatial distribution of 106 \nlithologies is more heterogeneous and distinction of different rock units is potentially 107 \nproblematic in itself, has not been demonstrated.  108 \nThe aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of airborne LiDAR for the detailed 109 \nlithological mapping of a section of the Troodos ophiolite, Cyprus. Given the lithological 110 \nheterogeneity of the study area, the intention was to develop a semi-automated algorithm to 111 \nincrease the speed and objectivity of the mapping process in comparison to traditional field 112 \nsurveys and visual image interpretation. The algorithm is based on the identification and 113 \nclassification of an optimal set of morphometric variables that were chosen for their ability to 114 \ndiscriminate four principal lithological units within the study area. The mapping performance of 115 \nthis algorithm is assessed using conventional classification accuracy statistics and is spatially 116 \nrevealed by mapping the classification uncertainty. 117 \nPage 7 of 37 \n \n 118 \n2. Study area 119 \nThe Troodos ophiolite has long been recognised as an uplifted slice of oceanic crust and 120 \nmantle that was created through sea-floor spreading (Gass, 1968; Moores & Vine, 1971). 121 \nForming the central region of the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus, the ophiolite displays 122 \na dome-like structure centred on Mt Olympus (1,952 m; Fig. 1). The ophiolite stratigraphy 123 \nincludes a mantle sequence consisting of harzburgites, dunites and a serpentinite diapir exposed 124 \nat the highest elevations. Along the north slope of the range, the mantle sequence is 125 \nstratigraphically overlain by a largely gabbroic plutonic complex, a sheeted dyke complex, 126 \nextrusive lavas and oceanic sediments (Varga & Moores, 1985).   127 \nThe study area is located on the northern flank of the Troodos ophiolite (Fig. 1) and 128 \ncomprises a 16 km\n2\n area with topographic relief on the order of 200 m. The area has a complex 129 \nlandscape in terms of geology and both natural and anthropogenic influences on topography. The 130 \narea consists of four main lithological units \u2014 the Basal Group lavas and dykes, pillow lavas 131 \n(Upper and Lower), Lefkara Formation chalky marls and alluvium\u2013colluvium. Conventional 132 \nfield and photogeological mapping, together with some ambiguity in defining the units, is 133 \napparently responsible for some considerable differences between the two existing geological 134 \nmaps of this study area (Fig. 2). Despite having a coarser scale, the 1:250,000-scale map is the 135 \nmost recent version and considered to be the most geologically accurate.   136 \nStratigraphically, the Basal Group is the lowest unit in the study area. This unit represents 137 \na transition from the underlying sheeted dyke complex (100% dykes) to the overlying pillow 138 \nlavas. Consisted of both dykes and screens of pillow lavas, the definition of the Basal Group is 139 \nsomewhat subjective. In general it contains at least 50% dykes, but more commonly has a dyke 140 \nPage 8 of 37 \n \nabundance of 80\u201390% dykes (Bear, 1960). Typical Basal Group outcrops can usually be 141 \nidentified in the field according to their relatively high topography and steep relief (Fig. 3a). 142 \nThe pillow lavas are divided into the Upper Pillow Lavas and the Lower Pillow Lavas 143 \naccording to mineralogy, colour and dyke abundance (Wilson 1959; Gass, 1960). However, this 144 \ndivision is difficult to apply in the field (Govett & Pantazis, 1971) and an unconformable or 145 \ntransitional boundary between the two lava units has led to uncertainty over this division (Boyle 146 \n& Robertson, 1984). Due to this ambiguity, the pillow lavas are treated as one unit in this study. 147 \nIn the field, pillow lava terrain is characterised by undulating, hummocky topography (Fig. 3b). 148 \nAccurate mapping of this unit is crucial to volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) mineral 149 \nexploration on Cyprus, as the Troodos VMS deposits are predominantly confined to the pillow 150 \nlavas (Constantinou, 1980). 151 \nTwo types of sedimentary cover are present within the study area: the Lefkara Formation 152 \nand alluvium\u2013colluvium. The Lefkara Formation represents part of the early oceanic 153 \nsedimentation that was deposited during the late Cretaceous to early Miocene (K\u00e4hler & Stow, 154 \n1998). This formation, which comprises marls, chalks and cherts, directly overlays pillow lavas 155 \nto form gently rolling hills (Fig. 3c). Alluvium\u2013colluvium refers to Quaternary sediments, such 156 \nas sand, silts, soils and gravels that were deposited fluvially or through erosion. Alluvial\u2013157 \ncolluvial cover is characterised by its relatively flat and smooth topography (Fig. 3d), which 158 \nregularly fills depressions in pillow lava terrain. Alluvial\u2013colluvial cover is frequently exploited 159 \nfor agricultural purposes throughout the study area.  160 \nMajor anthropogenic features are quite scarce and include the Mathiati VMS mine with 161 \nspoil tips and the village of Agia Varvara Lefkosias in the north. Land disturbances due to 162 \nagricultural activity are confined to alluvial\u2013colluvial areas and although these occur throughout 163 \nPage 9 of 37 \n \nthe study area, they are most commonly found in the north-west. The study area has a semi-arid 164 \nenvironment and vegetation cover is relatively dense and widespread, resulting in only small 165 \nareas of completely exposed rock outcrops. Vegetation cover consists of crops, patchy forests, 166 \nshrubbery, grasses and lichen. The combination of variable geology, vegetation cover and land-167 \nuse makes this a particularly complex area for evaluating the application of airborne LiDAR to 168 \nlithological mapping. 169 \n 170 \n3. Airborne LiDAR data and pre-processing 171 \n3.1 Data acquisition 172 \nAirborne LiDAR data were acquired on the 14\nth\n May, 2005 by the Natural Environment 173 \nResearch Council Airborne Research and Survey Facility (NERC ARSF). The survey was 174 \nundertaken at an average flying altitude of 2550 m above sea level, using a Dornier aircraft 175 \nmounted with an Optech ALTM-3033 system. The aircraft\u2013ground distance ranged between 176 \n2100\u20132300 m due to topographic relief within the study area. Operating with a laser pulse 177 \nrepetition rate of 33 kHz and half-scan angle of \u00b119.4\u00b0 either side of nadir, approximately 178 \n7,600,000 points were acquired for the study area with an average point density of 0.48 m\n-2\n. The 179 \ndataset contains point data from five overlapping flight lines, each with a swath width of 1400\u2013180 \n1500 m and an overlap of 20%\u201350% between adjacent swaths. 181 \nInitial data processing was undertaken by the Unit for Landscape Modelling at the 182 \nUniversity of Cambridge, UK. This involved combining Global Positioning System (GPS) data 183 \nwith the aircraft orientation \u2014 recorded using an Inertial Navigation System (INS) \u2014 to determine 184 \nthe 3-dimensional coordinates of each laser return (Wehr & Lohr, 1999). The LiDAR point data 185 \nwere delivered as ASCII files containing the x-y-z coordinates and intensity values of all first 186 \nPage 10 of 37 \n \nand last returns in the WGS84 Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone 36-North coordinate 187 \nsystem. Information regarding the absolute accuracy of the processed point data was not 188 \nprovided, however the relative vertical accuracy was found to be less than 8 cm as determined 189 \nfrom the standard deviation of returns from a flat water surface (Glenn et al., 2006). 190 \n 191 \n3.2. Digital terrain model (DTM) generation 192 \nThe LiDAR dataset originally contained returns from both ground and non-ground 193 \nobjects, such as trees and buildings. In order to generate a DTM it is necessary to remove all 194 \nnon-ground features from the dataset. Point data were classified as either ground or non-ground 195 \nreturns using a triangulated irregular network (TIN) densification algorithm (Axelsson, 2000), 196 \nimplemented in the TerraScan software (www.terrasolid.fi\/en). This algorithm iteratively 197 \nclassifies returns as either ground or non-ground according to angle and distance thresholds 198 \napplied to TIN facets. Due to the relatively high degree of topographic variability within the 199 \nstudy area, the data in individual flight lines were classified separately. In each case the 200 \nclassification parameters and threshold were determined experimentally. The maximum terrain 201 \nangle and iteration distance threshold were kept constant throughout, at 88\u00b0 and 1.40 m, 202 \nrespectively. The appropriate maximum building size and iteration angle threshold were found to 203 \nbe more scene-dependent. In general, the maximum building size and iteration angle varied from 204 \n20 m and 14\u00b0 for flight lines dominated by relatively high relief, to 60 m and 6\u00b0 for flight lines 205 \nacquired over relatively flat terrain. To verify the results of the classification process, several 206 \ncross-sections were extracted from each flight line and inspected to ensure the point data were 207 \nassigned to the correct return class. Wherever necessary, misclassified points were manually re-208 \nPage 11 of 37 \n \nassigned to the correct class. Following classification, non-ground returns were discarded, while 209 \npoints classified as ground returns were used in the generation of the DTM. 210 \nThe accuracy of gridded LiDAR data products is affected by the choice of interpolation 211 \nalgorithm and spatial resolution (Smith et al., 2005; Palamara et al., 2007; Bater & Coops, 2009). 212 \nIt is therefore important to select an appropriate algorithm and resolution in order to avoid errors 213 \nin the DTM having a significant effect on subsequent morphometric analysis. To determine the 214 \nmost appropriate algorithm and resolution, DTMs were generated at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 m 215 \nresolutions using a range of popular interpolation algorithms. The interpolation algorithms 216 \nevaluated were inverse distance weighted, block kriging, nearest neighbour, cubic polynomial, 217 \nmodified Shepard\u2019s and triangulation with linear interpolation. Interpolation errors associated 218 \nwith each algorithm and resolution were assessed quantitatively using statistics generated 219 \nthrough split-sample validation (Smith et al., 2005). This involved the random selection and 220 \nomission of approximately 9% of the ground returns, while the remaining 91% were used to 221 \ngenerate DTMs. The residuals between all omitted data points and their predicted values in the 222 \nDTM were calculated and used to generate interpolation error statistics, such as the mean error 223 \n(indicating the magnitude and direction of any bias) and mean absolute error (Bater & Coops, 224 \n2009). The DTMs were also visually inspected for interpolation artefacts (e.g., null and spurious 225 \nelevations) using shaded relief images with varying illumination directions and vertical 226 \nexaggeration. The DTM generation, along with both visual and quantitative interpolation 227 \nanalysis were all undertaken using Surfer 8.0 (Golden Software, Inc.).  228 \nThe split-sample validation results showed that all of the interpolation algorithms tended 229 \nto underestimate the actual elevation (mean errors ranging from -0.10 m to -0.12 m), with the 230 \nexception of the triangulation with linear interpolation which slightly overestimated elevation 231 \nPage 12 of 37 \n \n(mean errors ranging from 0.01 m to 0.04 m). Mean absolute errors were generally consistent 232 \nbetween the interpolation algorithms and spatial resolutions (ranging from 0.23 m to 0.28 m), 233 \nexcept for the triangulation with linear interpolation algorithm for which mean absolute error 234 \nincreased significantly with increasing spatial resolution (from 0.23 m at 1 m resolution to 0.49 235 \nm at 5 m). 236 \nDuring visual inspection, a \u2015ridge and trough\u2016 pattern was observed in all DTMs at the 237 \nextreme edges of areas where adjacent flight lines overlap. Cross-sectional profiles extracted 238 \nfrom the flight lines revealed that elevation exhibited an upward concavity error with increasing 239 \nscan angle towards the edges of swaths \u2014 a phenomenon often referred to as \u2015smiley face error\u2016 240 \n(Lohani & Mason, 2005). Such parabolic vertical error has been attributed to vertical beam 241 \nmisalignment or systematic range errors (Latypov, 2005). The observed DTM artefact is 242 \ngenerated when data from multiple flight lines are merged and measurements from large scan 243 \nangles do not coincide with corresponding measurements from smaller scan angles. The effect of 244 \n\u2015ridge and trough\u2016 artefact on the quantitative analysis was isolated by recalculating the split-245 \nsample error statistics using only a subset of residuals selected from outside the areas of overlap 246 \n(corresponding to ~3% of the total ground returns). As a result, mean errors were reduced to 247 \nunderestimations of between 0.01 m and 0.03 m for all interpolation algorithms except 248 \ntriangulation with linear interpolation, for which the overestimation increased to between 0.02 m 249 \nand 0.09 m. Also, the choice of interpolation algorithm was found to have a greater effect on 250 \nmean absolute errors than the spatial resolution, again with the exception of triangulation with 251 \nlinear interpolation. Nevertheless, the mean absolute error showed a significant decrease in all 252 \ncases when calculated using residuals from outside the areas of overlap. Kriging, modified 253 \nShepard\u2019s and cubic polynomial interpolation resulted in the smallest mean absolute errors 254 \nPage 13 of 37 \n \n(ranging from 0.09 m to 0.13 m for all resolutions), followed by the inverse distance weighted 255 \nand nearest neighbour algorithms (0.15 m to 0.17 m). Triangulation with linear interpolation was 256 \nthe worst performing algorithm, with mean absolute error increasing from 0.12 m at 1 m 257 \nresolution to 0.43 m at 5 m.  258 \nAs the \u2015ridge and trough\u2016 pattern was solely confined to the areas of overlap where the 259 \npoint density is greater, it was possible to almost completely eradicate this artefact from the 260 \nDTMs using a simple point spacing based filter prior to interpolation. The filter discarded the 261 \npoint with the highest elevation (i.e., the point most affected by \u2015smiley face error\u2016) when 262 \nmultiple ground returns were present within a given radius. The size of the radius was chosen so 263 \nthat the filter only operated on data points within the areas of overlap (in this case a point spacing 264 \n\u2264 2 m). In addition to removing this artefact, the filter also generates a dataset with a globally 265 \nuniform point density. The most appropriate interpolation algorithm and spatial resolution for the 266 \nfinal DTM was selected as that which minimised the mean and mean absolute errors, and the 267 \nappearance of interpolation artefacts in the DTM. Consequently, 100% of the ground returns 268 \nwere used to generate the final DTM at a spatial resolution of 4 m, by applying the point-spacing 269 \nfilter prior to interpolation with the kriging algorithm. 270 \n 271 \n 272 \n4. Methods       273 \nThe efficacy of airborne LiDAR topographic data for detailed lithological mapping is 274 \nassessed using the methodological approach presented in Fig. 4. Following the generation of the 275 \nDTM, the method consists of five major steps, which are discussed in the following section. 276 \n 277 \nPage 14 of 37 \n \n4.1. Training and validation data  278 \n Two independent sets of pixels were selected for the purpose of training and validating 279 \nthe results of the algorithm developed herein. Using knowledge of the study area, QuickBird 280 \nimagery (0.70 m resolution) and the existing geological maps, four training areas (i.e., regions of 281 \ninterest; ROIs) were carefully selected in ENVI 4.3 (Research Systems, Inc.) to represent the 282 \nfour lithological classes. All pixels located within these four training areas were included in the 283 \ntraining dataset.  The validation pixels were selected using a random stratified sampling protocol 284 \nto ensure that each class was represented proportionately and to avoid spatial autocorrelation 285 \nwithin the dataset (Chini et al., 2008; Pacifici et al., 2009). To do this, several ROIs were 286 \nidentified for each lithological class in the same way as that used to identify the training areas. 287 \nValidation pixels were then randomly sampled from these according to the total area of the ROIs 288 \nassociated with each lithological class. Table 1 shows the number of pixels, the equivalent area 289 \nand the proportion of the study area selected for each lithological class for use in training and 290 \nvalidation. In order to determine their effect on the mapping performance, it was decided not to 291 \nmask-out or treat anthropogenic features as a separate class. 292 \n 293 \n4.2. Morphometric variables 294 \n The correlation between lithology and topography that is apparent in the field is also 295 \nclearly evident in the 4 m DTM of the study area (Fig. 5). In order to automatically classify and 296 \nmap lithology using LiDAR data, it is first necessary to numerically quantify the topographic 297 \ncharacteristics of the lithologies using variables that enable adequate discrimination. After 298 \nconsidering the observed topographic characteristics, seven candidate morphometric variables 299 \nwere derived from the DTM for this purpose (Table 2).  300 \nPage 15 of 37 \n \nMorphometric variables like slope, plan and profile curvature are typical examples of 301 \nbasic first and second order derivatives of elevation. These three variables were derived using a 302 \nstandard routine in ENVI 4.3, which calculates the derivatives from a quadratic surface fitted to 303 \nelevations within a moving window (or kernel) that is passed over the DTM (Wood, 1996). 304 \nAbsolute values of plan and profile curvature were used to avoid an alternating pattern of 305 \nconvexity and concavity in highly undulating such as that of the pillow lavas. Morphometric 306 \nvariables such as these are scale-dependent; therefore, in order to identify the most suitable 307 \nscales for maximum lithological discrimination, each variable was derived using fifteen different 308 \nmoving window sizes ranging from 3 \u00d7 3 pixels (12 m \u00d7 12 m) to 31 \u00d7 31 pixels (124 m \u00d7 124 309 \nm). Moving window sizes were limited to 31 \u00d7 31 pixels as larger windows were found to reflect 310 \nmore regional-scale topographic information, rather than the local-scale information which is 311 \nmore relevant to detailed lithological discrimination. 312 \nRelief, hypsometric integral and the two LiDAR-derived measures of surface roughness 313 \nwere derived in Surfer 8.0. Hypsometry describes the elevation distribution within a given area 314 \n(Strahler, 1952) and can be estimated using the hypsometric integral (Pike & Wilson, 1971). The 315 \nhypsometric integral (HI) is calculated as: 316 \n  (1) \nwhere hmean, hmin and hmax are the average, minimum and maximum elevations within a moving 317 \nwindow, respectively. This hypsometric integral variable was also derived at multiple scales 318 \nusing the same set of fifteen moving window sizes detailed above. 319 \nSurface roughness can be measured using the standard deviation of slope within a 320 \nmoving window (Frankel & Dolan, 2007). This variable \u2014 referred to here as slope roughness \u2014321 \nwas derived at multiple scales by first determining slope within a 3 \u00d7 3 pixel window (i.e., 12 m 322 \nminmax\nminmeanHI\nhh\nhh\nPage 16 of 37 \n \n\u00d7 12 m) and then calculating the standard deviation of slope within each of the fifteen moving 323 \nwindows. The second measure of surface roughness (known here as residual roughness) is 324 \ndefined as the standard deviation of residual topography (Cavalli et al., 2008). First, a 100 m 325 \nmean DTM was created by smoothing the 4 m DTM using a 25 \u00d7 25 pixel moving average filter. 326 \nA residual topographic surface was then calculated by subtracting the 100 m mean DTM from 327 \nthe 4 m DTM. Finally, the standard deviation of this residual topographic surface was calculated 328 \nwithin each of the fifteen different sized moving windows. 329 \nIn general, good discrimination and classification performance relies upon homogeneity 330 \nwithin classes and dissimilarity between classes (Li et al., 2009). The morphometric 331 \nhomogeneity of the lithologies can be maximised by identifying the optimal scale for each 332 \ncandidate variable. The optimal scales can be determined statistically by identifying the moving 333 \nwindows size which minimises the spread of morphometric data within the training areas (Prima 334 \net al., 2006). Here, using the standard deviation of each training area as a measure of its spread, 335 \nthe most suitable moving window size for each candidate variable was defined as that which 336 \nminimised the average data spread within the training areas. More specifically, for each of the 337 \nfifteen moving window sizes, the standard deviations within each of the four training areas were 338 \ncalculated and then averaged. The moving window size resulting in the smallest average was 339 \ndeemed to represent the most suitable scale for that variable. This procedure was applied 340 \nseparately to each candidate variable, thus enabling multi-scale topographic information to be 341 \nutilised. The optimal moving window size for each candidate variable is shown in Table 2. 342 \n 343 \n4.3. Variable selection 344 \nPage 17 of 37 \n \nClassification using all available variables might not necessarily produce the highest 345 \nmapping accuracy. Some of these variables may be highly correlated, noisy, redundant or 346 \nirrelevant (Pacifici et al., 2009). Better classification results may be achieved when such input 347 \nvariables are discarded and classification is performed using a smaller set of informative 348 \nvariables (Kavzoglu & Mather, 2002; Verikas & Bacauskiene, 2002). An optimal set of variables 349 \ncan be determined independently of the classification algorithm, based on statistical criteria such 350 \nas class separability (the filter approach), or in conjunction with the chosen classifier (the 351 \nwrapper approach). Despite using a non-parametric classifier, a filter approach was adopted as 352 \nthis enabled an exhaustive evaluation of all possible variable combinations to be conducted more 353 \nefficiently than with a wrapper approach.  354 \nThe number of candidate variables was initially reduced by identifying and discarding 355 \nlinearly correlated and therefore redundant variables through the calculation of Pearson\u2019s 356 \nProduct Moment Correlation Coefficients. The optimal set of variables for lithological 357 \ndiscrimination was then determined from the remaining candidates through class separability 358 \nanalysis (Dong & Leblon, 2004). To do this, the morphometric separability between pairs of 359 \nlithological classes (i.e., training areas) was calculated for every combination of two or more 360 \nvariables using the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance (Richards, 1994). For four lithologies, there 361 \nare six possible pairs of classes and therefore six JM distances for each combination of variables. 362 \nThe JM distance ranges from 0\u20132, with pairs classes being inseparable for JM distances of 0 but 363 \ncompletely separable for distances close to 2. The combination of variables resulting in both the 364 \nlargest minimum and largest average JM distances is selected as the optimum for lithological 365 \ndiscrimination. 366 \n 367 \nPage 18 of 37 \n \n4.4. Classification 368 \nA lithological map was generated using the optimal set of morphometric variables as 369 \ninputs to a topologically preserving artificial neural network classifier; the Kohonen Self-370 \nOrganizing Map (SOM) (Kohonen, 1982, 2001). Artificial neural networks possess many 371 \nadvantages over conventional statistical classifiers, since they are non-parametric, robust in 372 \nhandling noisy data and can learn complex patterns (Ji, 2000). Applications of the SOM to 373 \nremote sensing data include land-use classification (Ji, 2000; Bagan et al., 2005; Jianwen & 374 \nBagan, 2005), lithological mapping (Mather et al., 1998; Bedini, 2009) and geomorphometric 375 \nfeature analysis (Ehsani & Quiel, 2008a, 2008b).  376 \nThe SOM network consists of an input layer and an output layer. The input layer contains 377 \none neuron for each of the input variables, whereas the output layer is a two-dimensional array of 378 \nneurons. Neurons in the output layer are connected to those in the input layer via synaptic 379 \nweights. Random synaptic weights, ranging from 0 to 1, are initially assigned to the output 380 \nneurons. These weights are then adjusted during learning to best describe patterns in the input 381 \ndata (Mather et al., 1998). Network learning is an iterative process and involves two stages: 382 \nunsupervised coarse tuning and supervised fine tuning. The SOM algorithm in IDRISI Andes 383 \nwas used in this study (Li & Eastman, 2006). 384 \nAn input vector (a pixel in morphometric space) is represented by the vector x = {x1, 385 \nx2\u2026, xn}, where n is the number of input variables (and input neurons) used in the classification. 386 \nDuring coarse tuning, input vectors are presented to the network and in each case the output 387 \nneuron with the minimum Euclidean distance between its weight vector and the input vector is 388 \nselected as the winner: 389 \nPage 19 of 37 \n \n \n \n(2) \nwhere xi(t) is the input to neuron i at iteration t and wji(t) is the synaptic weight connecting output 390 \nneuron j to the input neuron i at iteration t. The weight vector of the winner and output neurons 391 \nwithin a neighbourhood of radius \u03b3 of the winner are then adjusted in the direction of the input 392 \nvector: 393 \n  (3) \nwhere wji(t +1) is the adjusted weight vector and \u03b1(t) is the learning rate at iteration t. The 394 \nweights of neurons outside the neighbourhood remain unadjusted. The learning rate decreases 395 \ngradually during the coarse tuning stage from an initial learning rate (\u03b1max) to a final learning rate 396 \n(\u03b1min) , after the total number of iterations (tmax): 397 \n \n (4) \n Similarly, the radius of the neighbourhood also decreases steadily during the coarse 398 \ntuning stage:  399 \n  \n(5) \nA large initial neighbourhood is usually chosen, resulting in widespread adjustments to the 400 \nweight vectors of neurons in the output layer. As learning progresses, \u03b3 decreases until the 401 \nweight of only the winning neuron is adjusted.  402 \nn\ni\njii\nj\ntwtxarg\n1\n2 \n))()((minwinner\n)](-)()[(+)(=)1+( twtxt\u03b1twtw jiijiji\nmax\nmax\nmin\nmax)(\nt\nt\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1t\u03b1\nmax\nmax\nmin\nmax)(\nt\nt\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03b3t\u03b3\nPage 20 of 37 \n \n The SOM network parameters used in this study are based on experimentation guided 403 \nusing the existing literature (e.g., Ji, 2000; Jianwen & Bagan, 2005; Bedini, 2009). An output 404 \nlayer consisting of 10 \u00d7 10 neurons was chosen, with \u03b1max = 0.05, \u03b1min = 0.01 and \u03b3max = 12. 405 \nCoarse tuning was performed using all input vectors, therefore tmax was equal to the number of 406 \npixels in each input variable image (i.e., 1,012,841 iterations). Prior to learning, the input 407 \nvariables were normalised to the range 0\u20131 using a logistic (softmax) function. This function 408 \nperforms a nearly linear transformation on most of the data whilst also acting to reduce the 409 \ninfluence of any outliers in each variable (Priddy & Keller, 2005). Normalisation increases the 410 \nlearning efficiency and also ensures that the input variable with the largest range does not 411 \ndominate the calculation of the Euclidean distances and the organisation of the output layer 412 \n(Ehsani & Quiel, 2008a).  413 \n Before fine tuning commences, neurons in the output layer must be preliminarily labelled 414 \nusing input vectors with known class identities. To achieve this, pixels from the training areas 415 \nwere presented to the coarsely tuned network and in each case the output neuron with the closest 416 \nmatching weights was triggered. Output neurons were labelled according to the training pixel 417 \nclass they were triggered by most frequently \u2014 a procedure known as majority voting. 418 \n Fine tuning was performed using the type-one Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ1) 419 \nalgorithm (Kohonen, 1990). The aim of fine tuning is to improve the classification accuracy by 420 \ndefining the class boundaries in the output layer more precisely. Pixels within the training areas 421 \nwere again presented to the SOM and the output neuron with the minimum Euclidean distance 422 \nbetween a training pixel and its weight vector was selected as the Best Matching Unit (BMU). 423 \nThe weights of the BMU were adjusted accordingly: 424 \n                                                                             if x is correctly labelled (6) )],t()()[()()1( cicc wtxt\u03b4twtw\nPage 21 of 37 \n \n 425 \n                                                                              if x is incorrectly labelled (7) \n  426 \n                                               if i \u2260 c (8) \nwhere wc is the weight vector of the BMU, wc(t + 1) is the adjusted BMU weight vector and \u03b4(t) 427 \nis a scalar gain term, which decreases with each iteration like the learning rate during coarse 428 \ntuning. Consequently, if the class identity of a training pixel matches the label of its BMU, the 429 \nweight vector of the BMU is adjusted in the direction of the training vector, but is moved away if 430 \nnot. Fine tuning was performed using \u03b4max = 0.005, which decreases to \u03b4min = 0.001 after 200 431 \niterations. Output neurons were re-labelled following fine tuning. In order to classify lithology, 432 \nall input vectors were presented again to the trained network and assigned the class identity of 433 \ntheir corresponding BMU.  434 \n 435 \n4.5. Accuracy assessment 436 \n The classification accuracy was assessed by determining the overall (OA), user\u2019s (UA) 437 \nand producer\u2019s (PA) accuracies and the Kappa coefficient (K) from a confusion matrix 438 \n(Congalton, 1991).  The OA is the percentage of validation data correctly classified, whereas the 439 \nUA and PA detail the commission and omission errors, respectively. The K is considered a more 440 \nreliable measure of classification accuracy because, unlike the OA, it takes into account the 441 \npossibility of agreements occurring by chance in a random classification (Brown et al., 1998; 442 \nPignatti, 2009).  443 \nIn addition to the lithological map, a second map was generated to analyse the spatial 444 \ncontext of classification uncertainties. To do this, the degree of commitment that each pixel has 445 \nto its assigned lithological class was determined using the SOM Commitment (SOM-C) (Li & 446 \n)],t()()[()()1( cicc wtxt\u03b4twtw\n),()1( twtw ii\nPage 22 of 37 \n \nEastman, in press). Calculated from the triggering proportion of classes on output neurons during 447 \nlabelling, SOM-C essentially provides an indication of classification uncertainty. Values range 448 \nfrom 0 to 1, with SOM-C values close to 1 indicating little uncertainty in the class identity of a 449 \npixel, whereas values close to 0 indicate high classification uncertainty. 450 \n 451 \n5. Results and discussion 452 \n5.1. Variable selection for lithological discrimination 453 \n The Pearson\u2019s Product Moment Correlation Coefficients revealed that the relief variable 454 \nwas highly linearly correlated (r > 0.80) with both the slope and the residual roughness variables. 455 \nAlso, slope roughness showed moderate-to-high positive correlation (r > 0.54) with almost all 456 \ncandidate variables. Consequently, the relief and slope roughness variables were deemed to be 457 \nredundant and discarded, reducing the number of candidate variables from seven to five.  458 \nMinimum and average JM distances for pairs of lithological classes were computed for 459 \nall twenty-six combinations of two or more of the five remaining candidate variables (Fig. 6). 460 \nThe minimum and average JM distances are generally smallest when separability is calculated 461 \nusing only pairs of variables and increases when additional variables are included. The slope 462 \nvariable appears to have the greatest influence on the separability, since its exclusion results in at 463 \nleast a 20% and 50% decrease in the minimum and average JM distances, respectively. In terms 464 \nof the pair-wise class separability, the Lefkara Formation and pillow lavas were consistently the 465 \nleast separable lithological units and were responsible for the minimum JM distance for almost 466 \nall variable combinations. The lack of morphometric separabilty between these two units can be 467 \nattributed to their stratigraphic relationship, where the Lefkara Formation has been deposited 468 \ndirectly on top of the pillow lavas. This results in the Lefkara Formation displaying some 469 \nPage 23 of 37 \n \ntopographic characteristics of the subdued pillow lava terrain that it drapes. Conversely, the 470 \nBasal Group and alluvium\u2013colluvium were consistently the most separable units with JM 471 \ndistances typically exceeding 1.90. Such separability is expected due to their contrasting 472 \ntopographic characteristics. Large JM distances were also usually observed between alluvium\u2013473 \ncolluvium and both the pillow lavas and Lefkara Formation.  474 \nThe combination which includes all five remaining candidate variables is the optimum 475 \nfor lithological discrimination, as this combination resulted in both the largest minimum and 476 \nlargest average JM distances (1.20 and 1.69, respectively). Furthermore, this combination of 477 \nvariables results in the largest JM distances for all six pairs of classes. For this optimal 478 \ncombination, the Lefkara Formation and pillow lavas were the least separable lithologies, 479 \nfollowed successively by the Lefkara Formation and Basal Group (JM distance of 1.22), pillow 480 \nlavas and Basal Group (1.70) and alluvium\u2013colluvium versus all other units (all with JM 481 \ndistances of 2.00). The relative importance of each variable to the separability of lithologies was 482 \nevaluated by examining the decrease in the JM distances after each variable was removed (Table 483 \n3). Removing the slope variable produced the largest decrease in the JM distances for all six 484 \npairs of lithological classes and the minimum and mean JM distances. This suggests that slope 485 \ncontributes most to the separability of the lithologies in the study area. Apparently, absolute plan 486 \ncurvature is also an important variable; particularly for separating the morphometric 487 \ncharacteristics of the Lefkara Formation, Basal Group and pillow lavas. The absolute profile 488 \ncurvature variable is arguably the least important as its removal resulted in the smallest decrease 489 \nin the minimum, mean and the majority of pair-wise JM distances. Removing the residual 490 \nroughness and hypsometric integral variables produced a similar decrease in all JM distances, 491 \nsuggesting these are of equal importance. This optimal set of morphometric variables \u2014 slope, 492 \nPage 24 of 37 \n \nabsolute profile curvature, absolute plan curvature, residual roughness and the hypsometric 493 \nintegral (Fig. 7) \u2014 was subsequently used in the classification stage.  494 \n 495 \n5.2. Lithological mapping and accuracy assessment 496 \nA lithological map displaying the four principal units and a SOM-C map, indicating the 497 \nclassification uncertainty, were generated using the LiDAR-derived topographic data (Fig. 8). 498 \nFollowing classification, a small amount of noise in the classified image was reduced using a 3 \u00d7 499 \n3 mode filter.  500 \nThe accuracy of the lithological map was assessed using the validation pixels and the 501 \nresults were summarised using a confusion matrix (Table 4). The lithological map has an overall 502 \naccuracy of 65.4% and a K of 0.53. Alluvium\u2013colluvium is the best mapped unit with a 503 \nproducer\u2019s accuracy of 87.9% and a user\u2019s accuracy of 98.8%, while the Lefkara Formation was 504 \nmapped with the least accuracy. A good producer\u2019s classification accuracy was achieved for the 505 \npillow lavas (66.8%), however more than 50% of all validation pixels mapped as pillow lavas 506 \nactually belong to other classes. Only 50.4% of Basal Group validation pixels were mapped 507 \ncorrectly, but with a commission error of just 29.7%. The most classification confusion occurs 508 \nbetween the Lefkara Formation, pillow lavas and Basal Group, which corroborates the results of 509 \nthe separability analysis. Although the majority of this confusion can be explained by their 510 \nstratigraphic relationships or natural deviations from the typical topographic characteristics of 511 \neach unit, anthropogenic activity is also responsible for a significant component. An obvious 512 \nexample of this can be found proximal to Mathiati mine and spoil tips where the natural 513 \ntopographic characteristics have been destroyed, leading to misclassification (Fig. 8).  514 \nPage 25 of 37 \n \nThrough comparison with the QuickBird imagery, it is clear that the algorithm is capable 515 \nof defining lithological contacts more accurately than the best existing geological map (Fig. 9). 516 \nFurthermore, the algorithm can be used to generate a more detailed lithological map by 517 \nidentifying lithologies in areas that have not been mapped previously. The SOM-C map is useful 518 \nfor highlighting areas of uncertainty in the lithological map. In general, SOM-C values less than 519 \n0.75 correspond to areas with a high degree of classification uncertainty, as clearly illustrated by 520 \nthe portion of Lefkara Formation incorrectly classified as pillow lavas (Fig. 9). In this particular 521 \ncase, the confusion is related to the difficulty in detecting the ground beneath some types of low-522 \nlying vegetation using airborne LiDAR. The class containing SOM-C values of 0\u20130.7 consists 523 \nsolely of SOM-C values of 0. These values are due to unlabelled neurons in the output layer 524 \nwhich were not triggered by any of the training pixels (Li & Eastman, in press). For the purpose 525 \nof classification, unlabelled neurons were assigned class labels using a minimum distance 526 \nauxiliary labelling algorithm (Li & Eastman, 2006), resulting in no unclassified pixels in the 527 \nlithological map. Pixels in the lithological map with corresponding SOM-C values of 0 do not 528 \nnecessarily possess a higher degree of uncertainty than pixels associated with larger SOM-C 529 \nvalues. The uncertainty of pixels classified using the auxiliary labelling algorithm is case 530 \nspecific. Examples where such SOM-C values correspond to both correct and incorrect 531 \nclassification are evident throughout the study area and therefore each case should be considered 532 \nindividually. Frequent misclassifications occurring at the contacts between agricultural 533 \nalluvium\u2013colluvium and upstanding Lefkara Formation outcrops are highlighted by SOM-C 534 \nvalues of 0. Ploughing proximal to the contacts is responsible for pixels with atypical 535 \ntopographic characteristics, which results in them being incorrectly classified as pillow lavas 536 \nthrough the auxiliary labelling algorithm.  537 \nPage 26 of 37 \n \nThe accuracy of the lithological map produced in this study is higher than the accuracies 538 \nreported by Wallace (2005) who investigated an area with a simpler lithological outcrop pattern. 539 \nIn contrast to Wallace\u2019s (2005) study, our analysis involves a larger number of morphometric 540 \nvariables and a more complex classification algorithm. In addition, the distribution of the pillow 541 \nlavas, Basal Group and overlying sediments is more complex because they are separated by low-542 \nangle contacts and are differentially eroded. Therefore, there is no simple strike-belt pattern. 543 \nGiven the geological complexity and anthropogenic factors affecting the topography in this study 544 \narea, we consider the results of our algorithm to be good. Additionally, the algorithm was 545 \nimplemented using minimal a priori knowledge of the spatial distribution of each lithological 546 \nunit. However, higher mapping accuracies can be achieved using more a priori knowledge. 547 \nDoubling the total number of training pixels (to approximately 2% of the total number of pixels 548 \nwithin the study area) increases the overall accuracy to 67.3% and K to 0.56 when the same 549 \nSOM network parameters are used. The ability to produce good mapping results given limited 550 \nknowledge regarding the spatial distribution of units makes this algorithm particularly relevant to 551 \nmapping relatively unexplored terrain. 552 \n 553 \n6. Conclusions 554 \nThis study assesses the efficacy of airborne LiDAR topographic data for detailed 555 \nlithological mapping of a geologically complex area of the Troodos ophiolite, Cyprus. Typical 556 \ntopographic characteristics associated with each of the lithologies were recognised in a 4 m 557 \nLiDAR DTM and quantified using a morphometric approach. An optimal set of morphometric 558 \nvariables for lithological discrimination were identified and used in conjunction with a SOM 559 \nclassifier to produce a lithological map. The resulting map achieved an overall accuracy of 560 \nPage 27 of 37 \n \n65.4% and a K of 0.53, which is considered good given the complexity of the study area and the 561 \nlack of a priori knowledge. The lithological map is more detailed than the best existing 562 \ngeological map and the lithological contacts are more accurately defined. The results of this 563 \nstudy demonstrate the significant potential of airborne LiDAR as a tool for generating detailed 564 \nlithological maps over large areas of either forested or non-forested terrain, where conventional 565 \nmethods are of limited use. Furthermore, the SOM-C map highlights areas with high 566 \nclassification uncertainty, therefore providing information regarding follow-up targets for 567 \nefficient ground-based verification.  568 \nFurther studies are required to assess whether improvements in the lithological mapping 569 \naccuracy can be made through the integration of airborne LiDAR data with high-resolution 570 \nmultispectral imagery. It is anticipated that the multispectral imagery will help to reduce 571 \nmisclassification in non-vegetated areas where the natural topographic characteristics of the 572 \nvarious rock types have been destroyed by anthropogenic activity. 573 \nThe detailed lithological map generated in this study represents a valuable aid to VMS 574 \nmineral exploration in the Troodos ophiolite because the mapped distribution of potential host 575 \nrocks is now much better resolved than on previous maps. In addition, the efficacy of this 576 \nalgorithm extends to other geological settings where lithology and topography are positively 577 \ncorrelated, with exciting implications beyond mineral exploration. In particular, the relative ease 578 \nwith which basement rocks and sedimentary cover can be discriminated at high-resolution could 579 \nbe useful in all terrains from open ground to densely forested landscapes for: 1) identifying local 580 \nareas for groundwater extraction, 2) locating areas with enhanced agricultural potential, and 3) 581 \nfor general infrastructure planning where it is important to know construction site substrates. 582 \nPage 28 of 37 \n \nThus the methods presented here may have widespread utility for a range of applications, 583 \nespecially in areas of mixed basement and sedimentary cover exposure. 584 \n 585 \nAcknowledgements 586 \nThis work was primarily supported through a NERC CASE Studentship (NE\/F00673X\/1) in 587 \ncollaboration with the British Geological Survey University Funding Initiative, awarded to SG 588 \nand NERC ARSF grant MC04\/30 awarded to JN.
