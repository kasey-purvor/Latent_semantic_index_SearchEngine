Very visible benefits to customer. Supplier expected to make cost savings themselves. 4. Shared cost savings Supplier and customer working together to reduce costs. The savings were then shared. Benefits of collaboration with supplier very visible to customer. Can result in oneoff savings but then new lower cost base becomes the norm; progressively more difficult to obtain benefits. 5. Shared profits Supplier invested in major project alongside the customer and shared the profits. Most common for larger, under-funded projects and in the public sector. Benefits to both parties can be considerable. Longer term and higher risk; also requires investment by both parties.

Target cost base reduction Sometimes initiated by the customer. When initiated by the company, tended to be company-wide and not particularly aimed at key accounts. Incentivize cost reductions In several suppliers the Key Account Manager\u2019s target had switched from volume to customer profit. Sometimes, cost savings were shared with the customer (see Table 1). Cost visibility One supplier had achieved rigorous tracking of costs to serve which it shared with the customer; both sides then collaborated in reducing these costs. Costs tracked and discussed included debt servicing, transaction handling and on-site servicing. Dedicated staff Several suppliers had reorganized so as to provide dedicated staff. One supplier had calculated the resultant saving in SGA as 3%, largely through learning curve effects and relationship building. Supply chain redesign Numerous supply chain initiatives aimed at cost reduction were found. Outsourcing customer service Several suppliers had outsourced parts of customer service, reducing or redeploying the use of expensive sales force time.

In recent years numerous papers have been written about the value\nof customers, mostly case study based and confined to analysis of single companies or\nindustries. This paper reports on research that takes a wider perspective and examines\nhow best-practice companies across a range of different industries try to manage their\nrelationships with key customers profitably. The contribution of this research is to show\nhow best-practice companies manage pricing, costs to serve, and customer risk in their\nkey account portfolios.\nKEYWORDS: Customer lifetime value; customer portfolio; key account management;\npricing; customer risk\nINTRODUCTION\nIn a business environment in which marketing is being challenged to demonstrate its\ncontribution to shareholder value (Doyle, 2000), the issue of whether customers are profitable\nand how to measure their profitability is becoming increasingly important (Reinartz and\nKumar, 2000, 2002). Studies have indicated that some proportion of customers is\nunprofitable, at least in the short term (for example, Wilson, 1996; van Raaij, Vernooij and\n3van Triest, 2003), although the degree to which customers are profitable or unprofitable can\nchange substantially from period to period (Wilson, 1996).\nBecause of these period-to-period fluctuations in customer profitability it is not a suitable\nmeasure to support decisions regarding the longer term. Relationship marketing decisions are\ntaken with regard to the entire relationship with the customer and typically take into account\nthe longer term. A more suitable measure than customer profitability is needed and recent\nacademic attention has shifted towards customer lifetime value and customer equity (Berger\nand Nasr, 1998; Mulhern, 1999; Blattberg, Getz, and Thomas, 2001; Rust, Lemon, and\nZiethaml, 2001; Hogan, Lemon and Rust, 2002) as the measures of the value of the customer\nthat are appropriate to a relationship marketing context.\nCustomer lifetime value is the forecast value of an individual customer throughout the\nlifetime of their relationship with the company (Berger and Nasr, 1998; Mulhern, 1999). It is\ntherefore of considerable interest to key account managers, whose individual customers are so\nlarge that their lifetime value can and should be studied individually. Indeed, many key\naccount managers are now tasked to manage not just the revenues but also the stream of\nprofits from these substantial customers (Woodburn and McDonald, 2001).\nCustomer equity is the potential value of the entire customer base, calculated as the sum of\ncustomer lifetime values within the customer portfolio (Blattberg, Getz and Thomas, 2001).\nThis measure is important to senior marketers managing marketing portfolios. There are\nindications that customer equity provides a better guide to the overall value of a company\nthan other, more traditional ways of valuing businesses (Gupta and Lehmann, 2003).\nCase studies analyzing customer profitability, customer lifetime value and customer equity\nare becoming more numerous, as are normative discussions about how the value of customers\nshould be measured, some relatively technical (for example, Berger and Nasr, 1998; Mulhern,\n41999; Blattberg, Getz and Thomas, 2001; Ryals, 2003b). Where previous research has\nanalyzed customer profitability and customer lifetime value it has often been on a case study\nbasis within a single company and industry (for example, Kalwani and Narayandas, 1995; van\nRaaij, Vernooij and van Triest, 2003). No previous studies have surveyed different companies\nacross different industries to review empirical approaches to the management of customer\nprofitability or lifetime value. The current research fills this gap by reporting on a study of ten\nbest-practice global companies in eight different industries, ranging from banking to\npharmaceuticals, from food and beverage to energy and high technology. In a series of\ninterviews with each company, all of whom measured key customer profitability and lifetime\nvalue, researchers explored their approach to managing the profitability of these key\nrelationships. The results showed that pricing, costs to serve, portfolio management and\ncustomer risk management were critical elements in managing the value of the customer from\nthe suppliers\u2019 point of view.\nThe research reveals that best-practice companies adopt a variety of approaches to pricing that\nreflect the relationship with their key customers. They also manage the costs to serve such\ncustomers, although they are frequently under pressure from their key accounts to increase\nservice levels. Finally, best-practice companies are aware of the importance of their key\ncustomer portfolio as a whole. They adopt certain portfolio management strategies, which\ninclude awareness and management of customer risk.\nMEASURING AND MANAGING THE VALUE OF CUSTOMERS\nCustomer profitability is calculated on a single period basis, usually the last full year of the\ncustomer\u2019s relationship with the business. The revenues and costs to serve associated with a\ncustomer (or with a tranche of customers, as described in Wilson, 1996) are identified\n(Mulhern 1999). There are problems for some companies in achieving even this snapshot\n5view of the customer; many companies have management accounting systems that run along\nproduct, rather than customer, lines, so identifying the revenues and costs associated with a\ncustomer\u2019s purchases across an entire product range can be problematic (Hill and Harland,\n1983).\nWhere customer revenues have to be estimated (or forecast, as in the calculation of customer\nlifetime value or customer equity), the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary amount)\napproach is sometimes used. This approach, which has been recently criticized (Reinartz and\nKumar, 2003), uses the analysis of historic purchasing patterns to determine historic and\nsometimes future value. Forecasting tools and data processes may be brought into play\n(Ryals, 2003a). Where key customers are concerned, the amounts involved and their\nimportance to the company usually call for more precise forecasting. In such cases, customer\nrevenues are determined from the mix of products that customers buy and the prices that they\npay. Because products and services to key customers are more likely to be heavily\ncustomized, prices may be set customer by customer. The literature suggests that it is in this\nsituation that value-based pricing may be used.\nValue-based pricing\nAs one of the marketing\u2019s traditional 4 Ps, pricing is a core element of the marketing mix.\nMarketers argue for value-based pricing, where the price of the product is set with regard to\nthe value to the customer. In practice, the majority of companies price their products or\nservices with respect to the cost of production, adding a margin (cost-plus), or they price\nrelative to the competition (Urbany, 2001; Hunt, 2002; Ryals, 2002b). One study of ten\ndifferent pricing strategies found that cost-plus pricing was used by 56% of respondents\n(Noble and Gruca, 1999), more than any other pricing strategy.\n6Value-based pricing, also known as value-in-use pricing, sets prices depending on how much\nthe products or services are worth to customers (Stedman, 2000). Here, price is a \u2018sacrifice\u2019\nand the expected value to the customer is the positive value-creation of product and service\nattributes on the one hand, less the value-reducing aspects of price and risk (Naumann, 1995).\nWhen goods and services are sold, value is created for customers and, in exchange, they\ncreate value for companies by paying for those products or services (McTaggart, Kontes and\nMankins, 1994). The level at which value-based prices are set reflects the exchange of value\nrather than the costs of production.\nThe fact that most companies use pricing strategies that do not reflect the value exchange and\ntherefore fail to connect value and price (A.T. Kearney, 2003) means that, at least in principle,\ncompanies may be under pricing their goods and services, possibly considerably (Hunt,\n2002). For those companies who are both providing excellent value to customers and who are\nprepared to try to measure that value, the profit potential of an effective value-based pricing\nstrategy is far greater than with any other pricing strategy (Monroe, 2004).\nCosts to serve\nAny difficulties in determining customer revenues pale, however, when compared with the\nproblems of costs. The literature tends to suggest that customer costs are usually divided into\ntwo; there are the direct costs associated with the products that the customer buys, and the\nindirect costs of serving the customer (for example, Shapiro et al.,, 1987; Bolen and Davis\n1997). Of the two, it is the indirect costs, the costs to serve, that are the most intractable.\nMany companies find difficulty in allocating these to customers. These are the costs that are\nlisted in the P & L account as SGA costs \u2013 sales and general administration. They can include\nsales, marketing, customer service, admin, and sometimes logistics (Niraj, Gupta and\nNarasimhan, 2001).\n7One solution is to allocate these costs proportional to the revenues that the customer generates\nor to the volumes purchased. The problem here is that customers vary in the service demands\nthey place on companies. Allocating SGA costs proportional to revenues or volumes will\noverstate the profitability of customers who are more demanding and understate the\nprofitability of customers who are easier to deal with (Ryals, 2003b). Allocating costs to serve\nproportional to revenues or volumes tells a company very little more than the revenue or cost\ndata. Certainly, it reveals nothing about the relative costs to serve and relative profitability of\ndifferent customers and different purchasing behavior. This is not a problem where the SGA\ncosts are small, or where the differences in customer buying behavior or slight. However, a\nsurvey of the Fortune 500 companies in the US revealed that SGA costs were the second\nlargest cost item after product costs and were growing up to four times as fast (Howell and\nSoucy, 1990). In other words, not only is the problem of SGA allocation a large one, it is a\ngrowing issue.\nActivity-based costing\nA partial answer to the problem of SGA cost allocation is the use of standard costs. Standard\ncosts are a calculated cost of a particular activity, such as raising an invoice for a customer.\nThe standard cost of raising the invoice is then multiplied by the number of invoices raised to\nthat client during the year; this gives the approximate cost of invoicing that client.\nHowever, many companies wanting to calculate customer profitability or customer lifetime\nvalue want to do so in respect of their key accounts (this is discussed below). For key\naccounts, it is not the small items such as the numbers of invoices or credit notes that have the\nreal impact on profitability. Instead, it is the cost of key account management that is the major\ncost to serve.\n8A measurement tool that enables companies to recognize the differing costs to serve of its\ncustomers is activity-based costing (ABC). Originally developed by the accountancy\nprofession as a method for allocating product costs, ABC has been adopted by companies\nwanting to calculate the value of their customers. When applied to the calculation of customer\nprofitability (Cooper and Kaplan, 1991; Hope and Hope, 1997) the results were startling; in\nthe case reported by Cooper and Kaplan, the US company Kanthal found that 20% of its\ncustomers brought it 220% of its profits. 70% broke even, and 10% accounted for minus\n120% of profits. Cooper and Kaplan made the observation that some of Kanthal\u2019s largest\ncustomers were amongst the most unprofitable. This observation indicates the importance of\ncustomer portfolio management and the possible exposure of companies like Kanthal to\ncertain risks in their customer relationships.\nMarketing portfolios and the risk of the customer\nThe notion of portfolio management is not new in marketing and academics have discussed\nthe product portfolio (for example, Bordley 2003) and the brand portfolio (for example,\nPetromilli, Morrison, and Million 2002). The purpose of treating a set of products or brands as\na marketing portfolio is to promote a debate about how the profits of the portfolio as a whole\ncan be maximized and to determine the most efficient allocation of marketing spend\n(Larr\u00e9ch\u00e9 and Srinivasan 1981, 1982).\nRecently, several researchers have suggested that the customers of an organization can also be\nviewed as a portfolio (Rust, Lemon, and Zeithaml, 2001; Ryals, 2002a; Dhar and Glazer,\n2003; Johnson and Selnes, 2004). Here, the objective is the maximization of customer equity\n(Lemon, Rust and Zeithaml, 2001).\n9The theory of portfolio management derives from the financial field and the management of\nportfolios of stocks and shares (for example, Brealey, 1983). In the financial field, portfolio\ntheorists point out that the objective of investors is not profit maximization, since profit\nmaximization might entail unacceptable levels of risk. In fact, modern portfolio theory holds\nthat the aim of the investor is to maximize return and minimize risk (Sharpe 1981; Brealey\n1983) and there is empirical evidence that investors do in fact behave in this way (Ferguson\n1987). Applying portfolio theory to marketing requires some consideration of the risk of the\ncustomer, and there has been some recent research into how this might be done (Ryals 2002a\nand 2003b; Dhar and Glazer, 2003).\nMETHODOLOGY\nBecause the aim of the research was to examine best practice in the profitable management of\nkey customer relationships, an expert sampling technique using the advice of a senior\nacademic in the KAM field was used to draw up a list of companies considered to represent\nbest practice. All were blue-chip global firms with their headquarters in the US or in Europe.\nThe sample frame used for this list was membership of SAMA (the Strategic Account\nManagement Association) in the US or of the Cranfield Best Practice KAM Club in the UK.\nThe quality of the sample was confirmed through academic and practitioner validation and\nthrough review of the results. The findings from one company have been excluded from the\nresults as it was deemed not to represent best practice. The final sample size was 10\ncompanies.\n10\nTo ensure robust and generic results, a spread of companies across different sectors was\nsought. Companies from the financial services, energy, technology, pharmaceuticals, food and\nbeverage, credit services, logistics, and travel sectors were selected.\nBased on the literature, a discussion outline was prepared covering some 15 topics related to\nprofitable customer management. The internal validity of the discussion outline was\nconfirmed by a leading academic in this field. A total of 18 interviews of between 1 and 2\nhours were carried out with senior managers who either had responsibility for the company's\noverall KAM program or had a senior role supporting KAM.\nRESULTS\nThe best-practice companies who participated in this research were al forecasting and\nplanning their key customer relationships on a longer-term basis, with planning horizons\nranging from two years to eleven years and detailed forecasting for between one and three\nyears. Forecasts were revised at least annually. Several companies indicated that they were\nactively trying to improve their key customer forecasting, whilst one organization was\ndeveloping a major software installation to help support forecasting about these customers.\nForecasting was generally done on a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 basis, identifying different business areas\nwithin the customer and then summarizing these to arrive at a total customer forecast.\nPricing and customer revenues\nThe research uncovered a mismatch between what suppliers wanted to achieve with their key\ncustomers, which was value-based pricing; and that they actually achieved, which was in\n11\nmany cases based on cost-plus or competitive market rates. This suggests that customers did\nnot see any value to themselves in value-based pricing and that they tended to be more\nfocused on cost reduction. Some suppliers found their pricing strategies dominated by their\ncustomer\u2019s need for international price harmonization. A few were working towards a more\nsophisticated risk-based pricing strategy. The latter cases were the exception rather than the\nrule in having an approach to customers in which the view of the customer harmonized with\nthe pricing strategy. In most cases, pricing was often relatively tactical and driven by the need\nto win the next contract.\nAll the suppliers interviewed in this research said they wanted to achieve value-based pricing\nwith their key customers. Unfortunately, value-based pricing meant different things to the\nsuppliers and to their key customers. To the suppliers, it meant the opportunity to charge\npremium prices for differentiated products and services; to customers, it often meant cost\nsavings.\nFive slightly different bases for value-based pricing were reported (Table 1).\n- Bring in Table 1 -\nSuppliers also reported cases where they had developed \u2018value-added\u2019 elements that\ncustomers didn\u2019t want and refused to pay for. This could result in a customer being thought\nof, wrongly, as driven mainly or entirely by price.\nCost-plus or competitive pricing\n12\nCost-plus or competitive pricing moves were often driven by customers. For key accounts,\nthis was not infrequently associated with some degree of cost transparency between supplier\nand customer. However, suppliers reported that they were getting smarter. As one said,\ncustomers always driving for lower prices were now excluded from their global account\nprogram, \u201cIf you are always being driven to lowest price, it shows there is no loyalty\u201d\n(Woodburn, Holt and McDonald, 2004 p. 124).\nPrice harmonization\nSuppliers commonly reported that customers were asking for internationally or globally-\nharmonized prices. This caused cost difficulties for suppliers, several of whom reported\nagreeing a compromise with their customers in which the world was divided into, for\nexample, three major regions. Prices were then harmonized within each region. Another\nproblem that suppliers experienced with international price harmonization was achieving a\nglobal key account management structure with buy-in from all the different regions. Internal\ndisputes could damage service to these very big customers.\nRisk-based pricing\nThe fifth approach to pricing described by the suppliers was risk-based \u2013 that is, taking into\naccount the riskiness of the customer. The financial stability of major customers was a source\nof concern for suppliers. Setting higher prices for new customers was relatively common; one\nsupplier even set higher prices for customers in unstable market places. True risk sharing was\nrare; suppliers tried first to reduce risk through information and collaboration with the\ncustomer and second to protect themselves through contractual arrangements against risk.\nOnly occasionally did suppliers consider residual risk and try to price accordingly. None of\n13\nthe suppliers in the sample appeared to have quantified approaches to measuring risk or to\nhave a systematic process for calculating risk premiums.\nCosts to serve\nRather than the sharp distinction between product costs and costs to serve suggested by the\nliterature, suppliers commented that the distinction became blurred in their relationships with\nkey accounts. This was because of collaboration on cost-reduction or profit-improvement\nprojects (Table 1). Projects cited by suppliers included product redesign, supply chain\nmanagement and back office system redesign. In addition to these collaborative projects,\nseven different types of initiative for reducing costs to serve key accounts were identified\n(Table 2).\n- Bring in Table 2 -\nActivity-based costing\nAs discussed above, suppliers incur substantial costs in serving customers, particularly key\naccounts, which are not reflected in product costs. Cooper and Kaplan (1991) have described\nthe application of ABC to the measurement of customer profitability. The companies in the\ncurrent research, despite being experienced in key account management, varied greatly in the\ndegree to which they used ABC, ranging from not at all, through ad-hoc manual ABC\nanalysis of customers through to automated ABC on a customer by customer basis.\n14\nThe non-users either claimed that costs to serve were not a significant proportion of their\ncosts, or felt that historic costs were unhelpful in relationship management. The manual users\nreported problems with complex, time-consuming processes, with one ABC program\ncontaining 47 elements that staff were supposed to fill out. This had obvious detrimental\neffects: \u201cIt seemed that, although the system could handle detailed, customer-specific\ninformation, staff could not.\u201d (Woodburn, Holt and McDonald, 2004 p.100). Best practice\ncompanies were using or setting up IT-facilitated customer profitability systems that could\nhandle activity-based data. Even these, however, did not track 100% of costs to serve.\nSometimes, data from small countries or regions were unusable or unavailable and in other\ncases some customer subsidiaries with very different names from the parent might remain\nunrecognized. However, the best practice companies did believe that the time and effort\ninvested in the ABC system would pay off.\nOpen book accounting\nOne way in which companies may try to manage the costs to serve their customers is through\nopen book accounting, in which suppliers give key customers greater visibility about the\nmargins that the supplier is making on the goods and services it is providing. In theory, the\nsupplier and the customer agree a \u2018reasonable\u2019 margin; this protects the supplier from\nexcessive downwards price pressure from the customer and protects the customer from\nexploitation by the supplier.\nThe companies in this research expressed concerns about open book accounting, fearing that\nrequests for open book from customers indicated a lack of trust and were potentially\ndamaging to the relationship, although they also mentioned a number of positives (Table 3).\n15\n- Bring in Table 3 -\nThis research revealed that open book initiatives were invariably customer-driven. Suppliers\nwere suspicious of the motives (which were always about cost reduction) and were perhaps\nconcerned about the quality of their cost data. However, those who had adopted greater\ntransparency reported that the results were not as damaging as they had feared. Moreover,\nother customer initiatives to reduce cost were emerging; these included e-auctions and target\ncosting initiatives.\nManaging a portfolio of key customers for maximum value\nThe research showed that portfolio management of key customers had two elements:\nidentifying the members of the key customer portfolio, and managing the portfolio of\nrelationships.\nIdentifying key customers\nSuppliers took three criteria into account when considering whether to add a customer to their\nkey account portfolio: magnitude of potential business; that customer\u2019s propensity to buy the\nmore sophisticated parts of the supplier\u2019s range; and the customer\u2019s approach to suppliers.\nCommonly, geographical range was also taken into account when selecting key customers,\nwhich were invariably trans-regional and usually global in their reach. All the best practice\ncompanies were able clearly to identify their key accounts.\n16\nAnother characteristic of key customer portfolio management was the recognition by\nsuppliers that they had to limit the number of key customers in the portfolio. At the time of\nthe research the number of key customers ranged from just 12 to 100. However, companies\nwith more than 50 key accounts expressed concerns about the size of the portfolio.\nKey customer portfolio management\nThe theory of portfolio management is that investors run a balanced portfolio in which some\ninvestments are performing less well in the short term, but this is counterbalanced by other\nhigh-performers. The advantage in key customer portfolio management should be that it\nshould encourage investment in the relationship for the long term, even though the short-term\npayoffs in certain relationships might be lower.\nThe research found little evidence of real portfolio management at the key customer level.\nThere was a tendency to treat each key customer as an individual case, understandable in the\nlight of the size and importance of these customers. Some suppliers were able to invest in\ncustomers and even to take calculated losses if it felt this was necessary, but the true portfolio\napproach was by no means universal. One best-practice company had gone a stage further and\nhad developed clear criteria for accepting a loss-making situation for longer than normal,\nwhere the customer was of strategic importance or was in a merger with another firm that was\nof strategic importance.\nWhere key customers were managed as a portfolio, this was almost invariably because there\nwas a separate key account management operation within the business. Where a separate team\nor unit did not exist, it was more likely that key accounts would be managed independently\nrather than as a portfolio, either within countries or within product-based business units.\nSometimes, deals struck globally with key customers were circumvented locally because\n17\nprofitability responsibility rested with local countries or product groups. Key account\nmanagers in these situations reported having to negotiate with individual countries, although\none best-practice company had introduced a model setting out international service standards.\nA combination of careful portfolio management and effective pricing delivered a substantial\nbusiness success to one company. Portfolio management implies the exit as well as the entry\nof key customers if they no longer meet the criteria for portfolio membership. One company\nreported that it had implemented changes to pricing strategy that had resulted in the loss of\nseveral large but loss-making customers. The resulting improvement in business performance\nlifted the company from number eight to number two in its industry within a relatively short\nspace of time.\nThe risk of the customer\nWhere companies talked about customer risk, this seemed to include two elements (Table 4):\n- Bring in Table 4 -\nProbability of customer forecast\nSome best-practice companies adjusted customer forecasts in some way to reflect the\nperceived risk that the forecast might be achieved. Some multiplied the forecast by a\npercentage probability; others applied a \u2018probability hurdle\u2019 of some percentage likelihood\nand then only admitted business expectations to the customer forecast if they were higher than\nthis. One company, for example, listed each customer opportunity with its probability forecast\n18\nin the plan, but only included opportunities with probabilities greater than 80% in its customer\nforecast.\nRisk of the customer\nAll the companies in this research took some account of the risk of the customer, even though\nseveral described their efforts in this direction as \u2018rudimentary\u2019. The most common form of\nrisk evaluation was financial risk, which invariably took place when the customer was\nacquired. Some companies continued to monitor the ability of their customers to pay, either\nthrough observation of actual payment behavior or by monitoring industry catastrophes or\nmergers and takeover activity. Companies in the financial sector tended to take a more\nexpanded view and included the nature of the client, deviation from industry norms, and other\nfactors such as geographical and product elements of risk.\nSeveral of the best practice companies did go further in their consideration of the risk of the\ncustomer and considered risk issues such as misunderstandings of requirements, project\noverruns, changing customer demands etc. Sometimes such risks were discussed openly with\ncustomers and strategies to reduce risk and\/or to price for it were shared. One company had\nadopted a very successful strategy of evaluating certain risks of the customer and then taking\nthese risks on themselves \u2013 at a price.\nBarriers to risk measurement\nAll the companies were concerned about the measurement of customer risk, although there\nwere two barriers to implementation apart from lack of understanding about how to quantify\ncustomer risk. The first was key account manager motivation and the second was feedback.\n19\nSome companies still had systems in which the key account manager was paid by short-term\nresults. If a risk-based system was introduced and this resulted in higher prices, the key\naccount manager might find it difficult to meet short-term targets. Therefore, remuneration\nschemes might have to be adjusted. In other cases, the companies failed to compare risk\nforecasts with actual outturns. This meant that they sacrificed potentially valuable\norganizational learning, as well as making the risk evaluation exercise seem unnecessary.\nCONCLUSIONS AND MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS\nThis research has focused on the lessons that can be learned from the ways in which best\npractice companies manage the profitability of their customers. Two broad lessons emerge,\none to do with the accurate measurement of the value of the customer and the other to do with\nthe ways in which the relationships were managed.\nNot surprisingly, best practice in key customer management begins with effective\nmeasurement of the value of the customer to the company. The best companies were\nforecasting the lifetime value of their customers and were investing in systems to help them\naccurately ascribe costs to customers, sometimes using activity-based costing. Moreover, best\npractice companies forecast customer revenues based on real customer understanding rather\nthan superimposed targets or generalized models, and they did this on a longer-term time\nframe of up to three years. When pushed to adopt open book accounting, best practice\ncompanies have sound data to support their case and they accept open book accounting in\nappropriate circumstances and work with it positively. Exceptional companies also consider,\nmonitor and manage customer risk.\nMore importantly, the research reveals best practice in key customer management. Best\npractice companies used a range of pricing strategies and generally aimed to implement\n20\nvalue-based pricing, even though they were not always able to do so. Because they were able\nto take a longer-term view of their relationships with key customers, they were prepared to\ninvest in the relationship and to adopt pricing strategies such as confirmed price reductions,\nshared cost savings, and shared profits. Thus, when choosing a pricing strategy, they included\ntheir view of the customer rather than pricing purely from a product or project focus. They\nwere also able to offer some degree of price harmonization to customers. The really excellent\ncompanies incorporated their views of customer risk into their pricing and negotiated on these\nwith the customer, even offering to transfer that risk to themselves. In this way they found a\nnew source of customer value for which the customer was prepared to pay.\nBest practice suppliers had also developed a range of initiatives to reduce the costs of serving\nkey customers, ranging from the relatively mundane (staff reduction, target cost reduction) to\nthe sophisticated (supply chain redesign, outsourcing customer service). The best companies\nhad invested in activity-based costing and had a very accurate understanding of the costs to\nserve customers, and this understanding influenced their service offerings.\nKey customer portfolio management characterized the best companies. Their portfolio\nmanagement included a clear understanding of what constituted a key customer and a realistic\nappreciation that only relatively few truly special customers could be managed in this way.\nThis also involved an understanding that sometimes former key customers can no longer be\nregarded as such and, in these cases, having some mechanism for exiting no-longer-key\ncustomers from the portfolio. The very best companies who practiced key customer portfolio\nmanagement understood the principles of the balanced portfolio and were able to forego\nshort- and even medium-term gains in the interests of the longer term.\nThe findings with respect to portfolio management were particularly interesting when the\nimplications for organizational structure and processes are considered. It seems that the very\nbest companies have a separate unit for key account management and they remunerate the key\n21\naccount managers based on appropriate long-term targets. In the very best companies the\nproblems of the interface with country business units and the ownership of the customer P &\nL are understood.\nManagerial implications\nThe practical implications of this research are considerable, suggesting six areas that\norganizations should manage in order to manage their key customer relationships profitably:\nPricing; costs to serve; activity-based costing; open book accounting \/ greater cost\ntransparency with customers; key customer portfolio management; and forecasting and the\nunderstanding of customer risk.\nThe research has set out a multi-industry model of best practice in key account management.\nManagers could use this research to determine how close their own organization comes to\nbest practice and to identify changes they might make to their current key account\nmanagement practices and processes. The research strongly suggests that companies\nimplementing KAM or intending to implement KAM should pay careful attention to the\nmeasurement of customer revenues and costs, not just in the current period (customer\nprofitability) but also in the future. This indicates the need for effective forecasting\nmechanisms. The ramifications of the current research extend beyond marketing\u2019s usual\nscope, suggesting that organization structure and processes, plus performance measurement\nand remuneration policies, all have a role to play in enabling companies to manage their key\ncustomer relationships for maximum value.\n22\nREFERENCES\nA.T.

Traditional\npremium fixed\nprice\nCustomer accepts premium\npricing arguments. May\ninclude adjustments e.g. for\nfluctuations in raw materials\ncosts\nVery profitable if\nachievable.\nIncreasingly\ndifficult to sustain.\nMay be seen as\nexploitative by\ncustomer.\n2. Bundled solution\npricing\nStandard product or service\noffering wrapped with value-\nadded services and sold as a\ncomplete solution\nValue-added\nservices often\nhigh margin even\nif underlying\nproduct is not.\nCost opacity.\nCustomers\nincreasingly exert\npressure to\nunbundle.\n3. Confirmed price\nreductions\nAnnual reductions in supplier\nprices, either as a percentage\nor as a target price.\nVery visible\nbenefits to\ncustomer.\nSupplier expected to\nmake cost savings\nthemselves.\n4. Shared cost savings Supplier and customer\nworking together to reduce\ncosts. The savings were then\nshared.\nBenefits of\ncollaboration with\nsupplier very\nvisible to\ncustomer.\nCan result in one-\noff savings but then\nnew lower cost base\nbecomes the norm;\nprogressively more\ndifficult to obtain\nbenefits.\n5. Shared profits Supplier invested in major\nproject alongside the\ncustomer and shared the\nprofits. Most common for\nlarger, under-funded projects\nand in the public sector.\nBenefits to both\nparties can be\nconsiderable.\nLonger term and\nhigher risk; also\nrequires investment\nby both parties.\nSource: adapted from Woodburn, Holt and McDonald, 2004\n27\nTABLE 2: Supplier initiatives to reduce the costs of serving key customers\nInitiative Impact on costs to serve\nStaff reduction Replacing operations people previously dedicated to a key account team with\nad-hoc provision.\nTarget cost base\nreduction\nSometimes initiated by the customer. When initiated by the company, tended\nto be company-wide and not particularly aimed at key accounts.\nIncentivize cost\nreductions\nIn several suppliers the Key Account Manager\u2019s target had switched from\nvolume to customer profit. Sometimes, cost savings were shared with the\ncustomer (see Table 1).\nCost visibility One supplier had achieved rigorous tracking of costs to serve which it shared\nwith the customer; both sides then collaborated in reducing these costs. Costs\ntracked and discussed included debt servicing, transaction handling and on-site\nservicing.\nDedicated staff Several suppliers had reorganized so as to provide dedicated staff. One\nsupplier had calculated the resultant saving in SGA as 3%, largely through\nlearning curve effects and relationship building.\nSupply chain\nredesign\nNumerous supply chain initiatives aimed at cost reduction were found.\nOutsourcing\ncustomer service\nSeveral suppliers had outsourced parts of customer service, reducing or\nredeploying the use of expensive sales force time.\nSource: adapted from Woodburn, Holt and McDonald, 2004\n28\nTABLE 3: Perceived advantages and disadvantages of open book accounting\nPerceived advantages Perceived disadvantages\nReduces business risk Puts pressure on supplier margins\nAllows risk sharing with customer Diverts resources into administration\nDevelops experience and confidence in new\nprojects\nDiverts attention from real goals of the\npartnership i.e. performance requirements\nDevelops more openness between suppliers and\ncustomers\nDeters partnerships and responsive relationships\nwith suppliers\nEncourages behavior that does not support the\nrelationship, on both sides\nSource: adapted from Woodburn, Holt and McDonald, 2004\n29\nTABLE 4: Two definitions of customer risk\nRisk Definition\n1 Probability of customer\nforecast\nRisk of achieving \/ not achieving forecast business or\nrevenues.\n2 Risk of the customer Risk of unexpected events in ongoing business that would\nresult in unforeseen costs being incurred by the supplier.\nSource: adapted from Woodburn, Holt and McDonald, 2004\n"}
