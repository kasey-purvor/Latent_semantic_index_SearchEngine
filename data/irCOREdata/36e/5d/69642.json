The\nDepartment of Health (2003) White Paper, Our Inheritance,\nOur Future: Realising the Potential of Genetics in the\nNHS, states that: \u2018We will learn more about the genetic\nfeatures of common diseases such as heart disease and\ndiabetes and the way external factors such as diet and\nsmoking interact with our genes to increase the likelihood\nof developing a given disease . . . There will then be the\noption to test people for a predisposition to disease, or a\nhigher than normal risk. Treatment, lifestyle advice and\nmonitoring aimed at disease prevention could then be\ntailored appropriately to suit each individual\u2019.\nThe particular concern considered in the present paper\nrelates to the interaction between diet and genes. Here\nthe issues of nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics arise.\nNutrigenomics refers to the application of genomics in\nnutrition research, enabling associations to be made between\nspecific nutrients and genetic factors, e.g. the way in which\nfoods or food ingredients influence gene expression.\nNutrigenetics is the study of individual differences at the\ngenetic level influencing response to diet. These individual\ndifferences may be at the level of single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (variations in a single base pair) rather\nthan at the gene level. Nutrigenomics should facilitate\ngreater understanding of how nutrition affects metabolic\npathways and how this process goes awry in diet-related\ndiseases. It is envisaged that nutrigenetics may lead to\nindividualised dietary advice (Mu\u00a8ller & Kersten, 2003).\nIt is important to consider the context in which the\ndiscussion takes place. First, it is by now commonplace to\nrefer to the anxiety attached to public perceptions of\ngenetics, which has been particularly prominent in the food\nCorresponding author: Dr Ruth Chadwick, fax +44 1524 592503, email r.chadwick@lancaster.ac.uk\nProceedings of the Nutrition Society (2004), 63, 161\u2013166 DOI:10.1079\/PNS2003329\ng The Author 2004\narena, as opposed to the medical arena. Indeed, it was\npublic response to GM food that was at least partly\nresponsible for the attention now paid to public engage-\nment and participation. Second, the issues have to be\nconsidered not only in relation to contemporary public\nattitudes, but also in relation to the prevailing ethical para-\ndigms, which are predominantly concerned with individ-\nualism and choice, rather than with the common or public\ngood. Expression of these considerations is found, for\nexample, in relation to debates about labelling and\nconsumer choice.\nApplications: ethical issues\nNutrigenomics and nutrigenetics might be involved in\npublic health strategies to reduce the incidence of diseases\nin which diet plays a part, and in individual consultations\nto achieve particular targets, e.g. to avoid allergy or\nobesity. There may also be applications not integrally\nconnected with health; sportspersons, for example, may\nwant to achieve specific targets with diet. The present\npaper, however, is primarily concerned with public and\nindividual health. There are ethical issues associated with\nboth these aspects, in relation to genetic testing, the control\nof the information acquired and its use (who has access to\nthe information and what interests need to be protected)\nand the potential implications for understanding the\nrelationship between individuals and their food. First, there\nis the question of whether it is worthwhile going down\nthis route, given that any line of research has associated\nopportunity costs. Is there sufficient reason to think that\nnutrigenetics and nutrigenomics will deliver?\nIn other contexts critics have been dubious about the\npublicity that has surrounded developments in genetics,\nand they have argued that putting so much emphasis on\ngenetic solutions in health care is neglecting other \u2018lower-\ntech\u2019 solutions to health-care problems. This argument\nmay be justified, particularly in the case of food. While\nmuch is promised from the development of pharmaco-\ngenetics in health care, there is a crucial difference between\npharmaceuticals and foods. Pharmaceuticals are well-\ndefined compounds aimed at specific targets, whereas\nfoods are complex substances that have multiple effects on\ndifferent pathways in the body (Mu\u00a8ller & Kersten, 2003).\nThere are difficult issues about the size of the studies that\nwill need to be carried out in order to obtain meaningful\ninformation, and about interpreting them in the light of\nqueries about the statistical significance of information\nobtained from population genetic research (Ioannidis, 2003).\nThese considerations give rise to considerable uncertainty\nover the potential relevance of nutrigenomic research for\npublic health.\nOn the individual level, there are questions about the\nextent to which individuals will want personalised dietary\nadvice. Although there have been some moves in this\ndirection (Sciona, 2003), the decisions an individual makes\nabout what to eat are arguably much more complex than\nthe decisions about following a doctor\u2019s prescription of a\npharmaceutical. These decisions are influenced to a greater\nextent by factors such as anticipated pleasure. Perhaps,\nhowever, the potential for making advice specific to an\nindividual\u2019s genetic makeup would prove attractive.\nMilunsky (2001), for example, has argued that genetic\ninformation is a mechanism of individual empowerment:\n\u2018While rapid progress continues, there is much you can\ndo now for yourself and loved ones. Know your family\nhistory, be cognizant of your ethnic origin, determine your\ngenetic susceptibilities, opt for necessary gene tests, take\npreventative actions, establish appropriate surveillance,\nand seek preemptive treatment where applicable. In this\nway, you can exercise control over your genetic destiny,\nsecure your health and \u2013 in more ways than you yet realise\n\u2013 save your life.\u2019\nWhile Milunsky (2001) does not refer to diet in this\npassage, it is easy to see how the individualist position\noutlined here could apply in the context of nutrition,\nespecially where food is viewed essentially instrumentally,\ni.e. as body \u2018fuel\u2019. Some individuals will probably regard\nthe new possibilities in this positive light, while others will\nbe less keen. Also, there are clear resource implications\nover the provision of the testing facility. The White Paper\n(Department of Health, 2003) envisages an expanded role\nfor pharmacists in participating in genetic testing. The\npotential impact of genetics on the professional roles of\nnutritionists should also be considered.\nWhat will be the drivers in this field? Clearly, there are\ncommercial interests at stake, and the potential increase\nin companies marketing genetic tests direct to the public\nshould be considered. There have been understandable\nconcerns about quality control in this area (Advisory\nCommittee on Genetic Testing, 1997; Chadwick &\nHedgecoe, 2002; Human Genetics Commission, 2002).\nBeyond commercialisation, professional or self-referral of\nindividuals has to be considered.\nMilunsky (2001) takes an individualist position. Genetic\ntests are presented as giving individuals the information to\nmake improvements in their own life and health prospects.\nIronically, however, the more individualised the promises\nof genetics, the more that collective action is required in\nthe form of population-based research, in order to acquire\nthe information to enable the discernment of the differ-\nences at genetic level between individuals that will affect\ntheir susceptibilities. Thus, individual and public health are\nintegrally connected.\nThis issue is important because the growth in interest in\npopulation-based genetic research gives rise to questions\nspecifically about the predominance of individualistic\nparadigms in ethics. If there are new paradigms in science,\nfollowing the completion of the human genome, and new\nparadigms in medicine and nutrition, then why not in\nethics? It is important to be alive to this possibility in\nconsidering ethics and nutrigenomics.\nAcquisition of nutrigenomic information\nIn the medical context, association studies may be of\ndifferent kinds. There are studies on isolated populations,\nas in the case of Iceland, where the population database\nprogramme aims to establish associations between genetic\nfactors and common disease. Also, there are proposals\nsuch as the UK Biobank, which aims to collect 500 000\nblood samples from individuals aged between 45 and\n162 R. Chadwick\n69 years, again to discover associations between genetic\nfactors and common diseases such as heart disease and\ncancer (for example, see Parliamentary Office of Science\nand Technology, 2002). Another kind of association study\nmay be carried out on groups of individuals affected by a\nspecific disorder. For example, as part of a randomised con-\ntrolled clinical trial of a new drug, a pharmacogenetic arm\nmay be added to establish links between genetic factors\nand adverse reactions (see Chadwick, 2001). Analogously,\npopulation-wide or disease-specific nutrigenomic research\ncould be envisaged.\nWhile it is one aim of the UK Biobank to collect both\ngenetic and environmental information in order to study\nthe causes of common diseases in adult life, establishing\nlinks between genetic factors and responses to diet will\narguably be more difficult than establishing genetic links\nwith adverse drug reactions. For some time the national\ndietary surveys have been examining the link between food\nintake and nutritional status, as indicated through the\ncollection and analysis of blood samples. These surveys\nhave been controversial precisely because they involved\nthe collection of blood samples from healthy individuals.\nWhere the acquisition of genetic information is at stake,\nthe issues become even more complex. Collection and\nstorage of genetic information in a database gives rise\nto questions about control, access and use of that\ninformation.\nParticipation in association studies and genetic databases\nAn issue for research ethics committees looking at national\ndietary surveys has been whether or not individuals give\nvoluntary informed consent. In the case of contributing to\ngenetic research resulting in the establishment of a genetic\ndatabase, there have been queries about whether such\nconsent is even possible (Chadwick, 2001; House of Lords\nSelect Committee on Science and Technology, 2001).\nFirst, there are issues about public awareness; to what\nextent do participants and potential participants understand\nwhat they are being asked to participate in? Their under-\nstanding should not be explained in terms of knowledge of\ngenetics per se. Arguably it is possible for an individual\nto understand the issues affecting their interests without\nhaving a detailed scientific knowledge. Indeed, there is\nempirical evidence to suggest a good deal of lay under-\nstanding of what the relevant considerations are (Kerr et al.\n1998).\nRather, the point is that in the case of establishing\ngenetic databases, no one really understands what they\nmight lead to, including the researchers. Participants may\nbe giving their samples at a time when the ethical and\nregulatory framework is at a relatively early stage of devel-\nopment, so they are being asked to consent in a context\nof unpredictability. Furthermore, in the case of genetic\nresearch, the nature of the risks and benefits is different,\nwhat may harm individuals is not an intervention in itself,\nbut the potential uses and abuses of the information\ndiscovered from their samples. In this context there have\nbeen suggestions that relying on individualistic ethics\nsuch as the doctrine of informed consent may be a\nmistake. A draft report of the World Health Organization\n(2001) has stated: \u2018The justification for a database is more\nlikely to be grounded in communal value, and less on\nindividual gain . . . it leads to the question whether the\nindividual can remain of paramount importance in this\ncontext. . . . The achievement of optimal advances in the\nname of the collective good may require a reconsideration\nof the respective claims so as to achieve an appropriate\nbalance between individual and collective interests, includ-\ning those of ethnic minorities, from a multi-cultural\nperspective\u2019.\nIn this situation the development of alternative ethical\nframeworks, such as solidarity and equity (Chadwick &\nBerg, 2001), and conceptions of gift and benefit-sharing\n(Human Genome Organisation Ethics Committee, 2000)\nare increasingly being seen. The point of these frameworks\nis to try to introduce the idea that databases are common\ngoods to which there is a moral reason to contribute, as an\nact of reciprocity for the benefits they bring. Indeed, the\nlanguage of \u2018global public goods\u2019 has been applied to\ngenomics (Thorsteinsdo\u02c6ttir et al. 2003) and to genetic\ndatabases (Human Genome Organisation Ethics Commit-\ntee, 2002). Global public goods are defined as goods that\nare both non-rivalrous and non-exclusive. They are, in\nother words, enjoyable by all without detriment to others.\nKnowledge has been said to be the archetypal public good.\nIt is beyond the scope of the present paper to examine the\nextent to which this concept is fair. For present purposes\nthe point is that, by extension, genomic knowledge, as\ncontained for example in genetic databases, has been\nargued to be a global public good. This claim thus provides\nthe basis for the further argument that it provides a\nmoral reason, but not necessarily an overriding one, for\nindividuals to contribute to them, given certain protections\nof individual interests, such as privacy.\nInformation, access and control\nPrivacy has been generally considered to be a principal\npotential concern in relation to genetic databases. Where\ninformation relevant to individuals is stored, and its use\ncould be detrimental to their interests, questions immedi-\nately arise about who has access to it. This issue is\nimportant, not only in relation to worries about access by\nthird parties who might want to misuse it. For example,\nsuppose that at some point in the future it is common for\nnutritionists to give individualised dietary advice based\non individual differences at the genetic level. The need to\nconsider the potential impact on the professional role\nof the nutritionist has already been mentioned in general.\nTo be more specific, how would the nutritionist get\naccess to this information? Should it be envisaged that a\ntest would be requested at the time of consultation? Or\nwould there be access to a large population database?\nOr again, would all individuals carry a \u2018smart card\u2019\ncontaining their genetic profile? It is the latter scenario\nthat might be supposed to give maximum control to the\nindividual over their genetic information. Large population\ndatabases need controls relating to who has access and on\nwhat terms, and arguably leave less room for exercising\nindividual autonomy.\nPlenary Lecture 163\nAutonomy\nAutonomy is a concept that arises in the majority of\ndiscussions about ethics. Perhaps the most common\napplication of the notion of autonomy in the food context\nis in connection with consumer choice (choice as to what\nfood to buy and consume). Interpretations of autonomy are\nmultiple, however, and it is worth trying to tease out some\ndifferences that might be relevant to the nutrition context.\nHow autonomy is understood, in nutrition as in other\ncontexts, depends on the underlying theoretical perspective,\nwhich may not always be transparent. From a utilitarian\nperspective, individuals are deemed to make choices in\norder to maximise their own happiness or to maximise the\nextent to which their preferences may be satisfied. The most\nimportant versions require that preferences be informed\npreferences. Thus, on this model consumers are seen as\nbenefiting, by having information that will enable them to\nmake and act on choices that are most likely to maximise\nsatisfaction. In the context of food, however, nutritionists\nknow only too well that having information about what\nfood is most likely to contribute to health has to compete\nwith other facts, such as the seductive allure of \u2018bad\u2019\nfoods. There is no constraint that enables us to say that\ninformed preferences will be reflected in healthy choices,\nrather than choices for pleasure.\nIf such a constraint is wanted, it is necessary to turn to\na competing idea of autonomy, as expressed in the notion\nof making the rational choice, where \u2018rational\u2019 means\nnot maximising the satisfaction of an individual\u2019s prefer-\nences, but acting in accordance with what the chooser\ncould will everyone in that situation to choose. This\ninterpretation takes its historical roots from the philosophy\nof Immanuel Kant, first published in 1782 (see Beck, 1963).\nThus, if, for the sake of argument, it is known that certain\nfoods are detrimental to health, there are grounds for\nthinking that an autonomous Kantian agent would not\ntake them. Surely, the rational agent could not consistently\nwill that everyone knowingly chooses to eat foods that\nwould be likely to shorten life, e.g. by increasing health\nrisks such as obesity. Kant himself, in expounding his\nphilosophical position, said relatively little specifically\nabout food, but he did have quite a bit to say about an\nindividual\u2019s duties towards their body. What he did say\nabout food is indicative (although, confronted with an\nincrease in binge drinking and associated violent incidents,\nit may appear today to be no more than quaint), as in the\nfollowing extract:\n\u2018. . . the body must be frugal in its needs and temperate\nin its pleasures . . . We must be frugal in eating and\ndrinking . . . with regard to food, men may be led to\nover-eat even when the food is bad. To depart . . . from\nthe path of moderation is a breach of our duty to\nourselves. . . . Which of the two vices, gluttony or\ndrunkenness, is the more contemptible and the baser?\nGluttony is the baser of the two, for drink promotes\nsociability and conversation, and inspires man . . .\n[gluttony] is far baser, because it neither promotes\nsociability, nor does it enliven the body, but is purely\nbestial\u2019 (see Beck, 1963).\nIt would be a mistake, however, to present the issue\nfor today\u2019s consumers as a choice between making food\ndecisions either as utility maximisers or as Kantian agents.\nIt is important to distinguish between specific (local)\neating choices (I want this hamburger now) and making\nmore global choices about what sort of food to eat (I will\nnot eat veal). There is another sense to the notion of making\nan autonomous choice, and that relates to choosing in\nrelation to an identity. Individuals not only make choices\nabout what to do in particular situations, they also choose,\nat least to some extent, what sort of person they want to be\nand this choice is expressed to a large extent through food.\nIndividuals make statements about themselves when they\nchoose to be vegetarian, to patronise Macdonalds, to diet\nor to embrace obesity.\nThis issue of choice will also be important in the context\nof genetics and food. It has been seen in relation to GM\nfood; now it should be considered whether individuals\nwant to be the type of person who, as a way of life, takes\ngenetic tests before deciding what to eat. Here, again, there\nis a potential difference between pharmacogenomics and\nnutrigenomics. In the case of pharmacogenomics, individ-\nuals who are already in a patient role will be prescribed\nmedication in accordance with their genetic condition.\nPerhaps the same situation will apply in the nutritional\ncontext for individuals who are constructed as self- or\nother-referred patients. Of course, as with any advice of\nthis sort, there is a potential problem about compliance\nor adherence to a specific regimen. However, when the\npotential for public health is considered, is it reasonable\nto suppose that individual consumers will choose, on a\nsizable scale, to make purchases in the light of genetic\ninformation, when the items in question are in a super-\nmarket competing with many others?\nThe answer would seem to depend much more on\nconstruing oneself as a certain sort of person than on\nwhat is a rational choice. Furthermore, there is evidence to\nsuggest that in the food context there is a great deal of\nanxiety associated with genetics that has precisely the\neffect of discouraging individuals from taking the genetic\nroute. Although the anxiety might with good cause be laid\nat the door of GM food rather than genetic testing, it is\narguably genetics itself that has become associated with\npublic worries and concerns. This point is not new.\nDeborah Lupton (1996), in Food, the Body and the Self,\ndrew attention to the ways in which anxiety leads to the\nreinforcement of distinctions between the \u2018natural\u2019 and the\n\u2018artificial\u2019, and an increased tendency to seek comfort in\nthe natural and familiar. The author states: \u2018In the context\nof a climate of risk and uncertainty, being able to hold on\nto such binary oppositions and their moral associations\nmakes it easier to live one\u2019s everyday life\u2019.\nIn addition to the worries about genetics there is the\npotential for raising anxiety through misinterpretation of\ninformation about individual risk. This prospect will be an\nissue in both individual testing and in public health.\nPublic health: screening\nWhen considering public health interventions, what is at\nstake might be population screening rather than individual\n164 R. Chadwick\ntesting. Genetic screening is typically defined as the\ndetermination of the prevalence of a gene in an asymp-\ntomatic population or population group, where for any\ngiven individual there is no reason to believe that he or she\nhas the gene in question. It is normally contrasted with the\ngenetic testing of an individual for whom there may be\nsome reason to think he or she is at risk (Chadwick, 1998).\nIf nutrigenomics is ever to be implemented in public\nhealth, where can ethical guidelines be found? There are\ngeneral guidelines available on DNA sampling (Human\nGenome Organisation, 1998) and on genetic databases\n(Human Genome Organisation, 2002), but what is needed\nis a way of assessing when applications of nutrigenomics\nin public health would be worthwhile.\nThe Wilson & Jungner (1968) principles on screening\ngenerally have been applied in the genetic context to estab-\nlish under what circumstances it is appropriate to introduce\npopulation genetic screening. There will be no attempt to\ngive an exhaustive discussion of all the criteria in this\ncontext, but two of the most important criteria are that the\ncondition sought should be an \u2018important problem\u2019 and\nthat there must be an acceptable treatment. In the context\nof genetics, \u2018treatment\u2019 has been interpreted widely to\nmean that there must be some \u2018scope for action\u2019 available.\nPopulation screening for phenylketonuria clearly satisfies\nthese criteria. Phenylketonuria is a serious disorder that\ncan be treated with a diet low in phenylalanine (Gu\u00a8tter &\nGuldberg, 2003).\nPhenylketonuria, however, is a single gene disorder. It\nis not the case that most of the information coming out of\nresearch in nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics will be of this\ntype. What is at stake will concern individual risk factors\nand predispositions. Thus, the question arises as to the\ncircumstances under which it would be appropriate to\nundertake population-wide programmes involving genetic\ninformation, in order to achieve public health targets. A\npossible example, which is arguably identified as an\nimportant health problem, will be considered.\nObesity\nIt is now generally accepted that there is a national (and\nindeed international) problem with obesity. This problem\nhas been traced to well-recognised causes such as over-\neating and the \u2018couch potato\u2019 lifestyle. The \u2018mystery\u2019 of\nthe prevalence of slimness in France, in the light of dietary\npatterns, has been attributed, among other factors, to\nportion sizes and to the protective effect of red wine\n(Defeat Diabetes Association, 2003). However, suppose it\nwas found that there was a genetic variant, call it variant\nA, that predisposed to obesity when combined with food\nY. At what point would it be worth carrying out population\nscreening for variant A, as opposed to giving generic\ndietary and lifestyle advice? The scope for action, in the\nevent of a positive result, would be to counsel those so\ndiagnosed that they had a higher-than-average risk and\nthen give dietary advice specific to their situation.\nThere are different aspects to the judgment about\nwhether the genetic screening is worth doing. First, there\nare both advantages and disadvantages to undertaking\nthe screening (Shickle & Chadwick, 1994). Even putting\naside the issue of false negatives and false positives, there\nis a concern that those identified as negative may feel able\nto eat anything they like with impunity. There is a parallel\nto be drawn here with the cases of smoking and alcohol.\nNot everyone who smokes will contract lung cancer, not\nevery drinker will succumb to alcoholism. There are\ndifferences between individuals at the genetic level, which\naffect their risks of these outcomes. It is easy to understand\nthe attractions to an individual who likes smoking of being\ngiven the \u2018all-clear\u2019 to the relevant genetic predisposing\nfactors. However, that does not mean that there will be no\nother deleterious effects as a result of smoking cigarettes.\nThis situation is where potential problems about interpret-\ning risk information become relevant.\nFunctional foods\nAnother possible application of nutrigenomic and nutri-\ngenetics might be in relation to \u2018functional foods\u2019; but\nsurely, it might be argued, all food is functional in some\nsense. This reasoning indicates the need to be more precise\nabout what exactly is meant by \u2018functional\u2019. Functional\nfoods are those that have, or claim to have, a specific\nhealth-promoting or enhancing effect over and above their\nnutritional content (see Chadwick et al. 2003). On this\nbasis they are arguably closer to drugs than to foods as\nconventionally understood. Products currently on the\nmarket include cholesterol-lowering foods and probiotic\nyoghurts.\nThere have been a number of ethical concerns associ-\nated with functional foods, arising partly from the fact that,\nbeing foods, they are tested for safety but not for efficacy,\nunlike drugs. They are placed in supermarkets alongside\ntraditional products and yet they might not be suitable for\nall those who buy and consume them. The way in which\nthey are advertised, moreover, is potentially misleading,\nusing role models, for example, who are apparently not\nin the relevant high-risk group, to eat the products in\nTV advertisements. As the range of products including\nparticular ingredients increases, there are further concerns\nabout overdosing, e.g. in the case of children\u2019s diets. As\nthe regulatory system approves these products on a case-\nby-case basis, there are clear difficulties about how to\ncontrol the global effect on diet.\nAs noted earlier, currently food and drugs are regulated\ndifferently, which reflects views about the essential dif-\nferences between them. One purported difference is that\nwhile food is a necessary requirement of survival of\nthe whole organism, even in the absence of ill-health,\npharmaceuticals contribute to survival in so far as they\ntarget specific processes when healthy functioning is\ndamaged or at risk.\nFor functional foods the case for using genetic infor-\nmation to inform dietary advice may be stronger than that\nfor other foods. They are foods introduced into the\nmarket with a specific health-promoting claim, but as their\nnumber increases it may be important to have regulatory\nmechanisms that ensure they are used in the intended\nmanner. As the boundary between food and drugs is\nincreasingly undermined, their regulation will, arguably,\nincreasingly need to consider both safety and effectiveness.\nPlenary Lecture 165\nIn so far as they are more akin to drugs, the issues will\nbecome closer to those in pharmacogenomics, as what\nwill be assessed will be susceptibility to benefit from\nwell-characterised ingredients.\nConclusion\nThe extent of the role that nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics\nwill play in individual and public health is unclear. In so\nfar as they do have a role to play, however, there will\ninevitably be associated ethical issues. Those issues\nconcerning individuals cannot be fully distinguished from\nthose of public health, as both will depend on collective\naction in the form of association studies and databases.\nThis link in turn leads to questioning the reliance on indi-\nvidualistic models of ethics, and in particular of autonomy\nand informed consent. At the very least the interpretation\nof autonomy is not transparent. Individuals make food\nchoices for a variety of reasons, in part expressing their\nsense of identity. Much depends, ethically, on the mech-\nanisms of intervention: how will individuals be tested and\nwho will control the information? The challenges for the\nprofessional roles of nutritionists need careful thought, in\nrelation to their role in genetic testing and conveying\ngenetic information. Where public health is concerned\nguidelines are needed as to the circumstances in which it\nwould be worthwhile to undertake population screening, as\nwhat is at stake is likely not to be clear-cut disorders such\nas phenylketonuria, but risk information with all the\nassociated problems of accuracy and interpretation. Func-\ntional foods may provide an example of where nutri-\ngenomics and nutrigenetics may be particularly useful and\noffer added value over and above generalised dietary\nadvice. Functional foods take us closer to pharmaceuticals,\nwhere establishing a link between genetic factors and\nresponse may be easier to establish.\nAcknowledgements\nThe support of the Economic and Social Research Council\nis gratefully acknowledged.
