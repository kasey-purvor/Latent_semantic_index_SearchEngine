Oliver\nKnussen. Bridge 9184.\nIn my review of Vol. 6 in Bridge\u2019s Carter series\n(Tempo Vol. 60 No. 236, p.75) I complained of the\nmissed opportunity for pairing the Violin\nConcerto with the Cello Concerto. Yet I have to\nacknowledge that this latter work fits very well\ninto the chronological scheme adopted for Vol. 7.\nNor, this time, can I object to any incongruous\njuxtapositions of early and later pieces. The four\nworks included here span a mere four years\n(2000\u20132003) and, given that Carter was 91 in\nDecember 1999, they provide a more powerful\nrecord of late creative vitality than any other\ncollection on disc.\nOnly the earliest piece, the ASKO Concerto\n(2000) has been issued before; it accompanied the\n2003 release of Carter\u2019s one-act opera What Next?\n(ECM 1817) in a studio recording made in 2001 by\nthe Netherlands Radio Chamber Orchestra under\nPeter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s. The Bridge recording is actually\nearlier than that \u2013 the Amsterdam world premi\u00e8re\n(26 April 2000) \u2013 and launches Carter into the 21st\ncentury with a characteristically knotty (but far\nfrom grim) play on the contrasts between a\n\u2018whole\u2019 comprising 16 players and various\nsubgroups. Running just over 10 minutes in this\nperformance (the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s lasts a little longer) it\nactually makes a more substantial impression\nthan the Cello Concerto (2001), which is twice the\nlength and, perhaps for that reason, can\u2019t escape\nall accusations of a dutiful busy-ness in its faster\nepisodes, as well as of a general tendency to\ntextural opacity.\nMost memorable in the Cello Concerto is the\nstark distinction between the penultimate\nTranquillo, which seems to enter a state of\nmesmerised repose, and the concluding Allegro\nfantastico, which reverts to restless open-\nendedness. But there\u2019s an even more potent\njuxtaposition of disparate states at the end of the\nBoston Concerto (2002), where a short section\nmarked Maestoso \u2013 molto espressivo, notable for its\nwell-nigh Bergian melodic yearnings, gives way\nto an even shorter coda restoring the work\u2019s\npredominantly febrile character. The Boston\nConcerto is dedicated to Carter\u2019s wife Helen, and\nhas a literary epigraph from William Carlos\nWilliams\u2019s poem \u2018Rain\u2019 whose images of the\nfragility and flow of water have affinities with\nRichard Crashaw\u2019s \u2018bulla\u2019 (bubble), the key image\nfor Carter\u2019s monumental yet far from monolithic\nSymphonia: Sum Fluxae Pretiam Spei (1993\u20137).\nThe mixture of delicacy and energy in the\nBoston Concerto, set into a finely-balanced\nstructure which runs for almost 17 minutes,\nmakes this a particularly successful example of\nCarter\u2019s late style. Dialogues for piano and\nchamber orchestra, which followed a year later, is\nno less absorbing, with meditative moments \u2013\npauses for thought? \u2013 bringing light and air to the\nmusic\u2019s predominantly abrasive, caustic\narguments.\nAll these performances benefit greatly from\nthe supremely perceptive involvement of Oliver\nKnussen, and the quality of solo and ensemble\nplaying is outstanding throughout. The recorded\nbalances for Dialogues and the Cello Concerto take\ncare not to spotlight the soloists at the expense of\nintricate orchestral detail: perhaps a little too\nmuch so in the case of the Cello Concerto, though\nthe textures here \u2013 despite the valiant efforts of\nFred Sherry and the Knussen-directed orchestra \u2013\nare particularly difficult for the ear to unravel.\nDialogues is less adamantine, and hearing it soon\nafter the superb performance of the Piano\nConcerto by Nicolas Hodges, conducted by\nKnussen, during the BBC\u2019s Carter Weekend\ncreates the fervent hope that Bridge might\narrange to issue that \u2013 with other orchestral\nworks from the same event \u2013 as soon as possible.\nArnold Whittall\nJOHN TAVENER: Schuon Lieder.

Many of the texts\ncelebrate divine love and their joy is lovingly\nmirrored in Tavener\u2019s musical response.\nThe first song features artless, child-like\nvaulting piano figurations clipping through\ngauzed string harmonics, providing glorious\naccompaniment to the soloist\u2019s soaring line,\npunctuated by gently resonating temple bowls.\nThe second song, marked \u2018Monumental\u2019 is\nrecognizably from the same pen as The Veil of the\nTemple (2001), Schuon Hymnen (2003) and Sh\u00fbnya\n(2003): new vistas are opened up with every\ntranscendental harmonic shift. The crystalline\nclarity of the liquid piano trills in Song III is purely\nSchubertian; elsewhere, J.S. Bach, Webern and\nMessiaen are consciously alluded to. There is far\nmore to the cycle than mere eclecticism, however.\nThe twelfth song, the emotional core, is an\nextended, heartfelt setting of an early poem by\nSchuon, written in response to an unhappy love-\naffair which drew him closer to God. Oriental\nexoticism suffuses Songs VIII and XVI, whilst the\nlast song, \u2018Ein Lied\u2019, is particularly memorable for\nits child-like tenderness, feminine delicacy and\npoignant sense of journey\u2019s end: \u2018The heart will\nmelt in ultimate love - For all eternity\u2019.  \nThe settings are interspersed with brief,\nwispily austere, scuttling canons for string quartet\nin rippling quintuplets, based on material from\nthe preceding songs, casting new light on them.\nThe omnipresence of the temple bowls lends a\nceremonial air, highlighting the sacred nature of\nmany of the poems. \nPatricia Rozario exults in the soaring upper\nreaches of the solo part and the vocal writing is\nideally suited to her luminous, otherworldly\ntones. The Schubert Ensemble offer sensitive\nsupport, frequently heightening the emotions of\nthe solo line. They take centre stage in a haunting,\npurely instrumental Postlude where the piano\nrecalls the melody of the opening song and takes\nover the quintuplets from the strings in a closing\ngesture of reconciliation and harmony. Schuon\nLieder is one of Tavener\u2019s most enchantingly\nalluring works and the recording, as is bright and\nclear as the performance. The intimacy of\nchamber forces suits the personal nature of the\ncomposer\u2019s idiom perfectly and has inspired him\nto fashion a vibrant spectrum of rich textures.\nIn contrast to the freshness and palpable sense\nof artistic renewal and growth in Schuon Lieder, a\nmore prosaic feeling of completing unfinished\nbusiness hung over the world premi\u00e8re of\nTavener\u2019s Tribute to Cavafy for speaker, solo\nsoprano, choir and percussion (bells and Tibetan\nbowl). Featuring Vanessa Redgrave and The Tallis\nScholars, the piece was commissioned by\nSymphony Hall, Birmingham, completed in 1999\nand was to have opened the Hall\u2019s 2002\u20133 concert\nseason. Postponed at the last minute, its belated\ndebut four years later gave the impression that\nmost of the participants had moved on. This is\ntrue musically, in Tavener\u2019s case: with its simple,\nstark voice, Tribute to Cavafy predates the\ncomposer\u2019s recent embrace of all world religions\nand Western musical developments and belongs\nto his more austere \u2018Greek Orthodox\u2019 phase.\nThe centrepiece, \u2018Voices\u2019, was the indisputable\nhighlight. In between the narrator\u2019s dramatic\ndeclamation of Cavafy\u2019s literary descendants and\nthe Biblical record of Christ\u2019s genealogy, the\nchoir, together with a smaller group of singers\nplaced at a distance, chanted verses with\nincreasingly intensity. The semi-chorus sopranos\nnegotiated notes well above the stave with skill\nand purity, whilst the basses plumbed equally\nimpressive sepulchral, subterranean depths.\nMezzo-soprano Sarah Connolly\u2019s radiant solo\nline was distinguished by its ecstatic, swiftly-\nrepeated-note echoes. The gradual paring-down\nof the multiple lines to leave the basses intoning\nthe one syllable \u2018God\u2019 was an especially\nimaginative, lucid finishing touch.\nNothing else in the work quite matched this\nlevel of invention, though there were many\nindividual effects to admire, including the chorus\nmonolithically intoning the words on an ancient\ntomb while the narrator tries to decipher them.\nThe outer layers of the piece were identical: a\nfolk-like choral setting of \u2018Days of 1903\u2019 in\nCavafy\u2019s original Greek. On its first appearance,\nthe choppy, heavily accented, staccato soprano\nline called to mind a theme from Ennio\nMorricone\u2019s film score for The Mission; its\nsmoother restatement rounded off both the\nsection, and the work itself, in a yearning\ncontemplation well suited to words describing a\nlost love.  \nThe Tallis Scholars, under Peter Phillips,\ndemonstrated phenomenal breath control in\nextended passages demanding sustained\nsonorities and Vanessa Redgrave brought a\nmesmerizing presence to her key role as narrator;\nbut on first hearing, Tribute to Cavafy didn\u2019t appear\nto amount to more than the sum of its varied and\nfrequently engaging parts. Perhaps the truth is\nthat Tavener has produced such a wealth of\nrapturously beautiful and musically interesting\nwork since his newfound ecumenism, exemplified\nby Schuon Lieder and The Veil of the Temple, that\nearlier pieces now suffer by comparison.\nPaul Conway\n\uf763\uf764 \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 61\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nSCHOECK: Penthesilea, op. 39. Yvonne Naef (mezzo-\nsop), Renate Behle (sop), Susanne Reinhard (sop), Ute\nTrekel-Burkhardt (con), James Johnson (bar), Stuart\nKale (ten), Cheyne Davidson (bar), Imke B\u00fcchel (speak-\ner). Czech Philharmonic Choir Brno, Basle Symphony\nOrchestra c. Mario Venzago. Musiques Suisses MGB\nCD 6232 (2-CD set).\nThis recording from the 1999 Lucerne Festival\nwas made in conjunction with Swiss Radio and\noriginally appeared on another Swiss CD label. It\nfollows a pioneering LP recording of Othmar\nSchoeck\u2019s long one-acter under Zdenek Macal,\nalso with a Lucerne Festival cast, and the single-\nCD digital remastering of a performance which\nGerd Albrecht conducted at the 1982 Salzburg\nFestival. Schoeck\u2019s Penthesilea was first performed\nat the Dresden State Opera in 1927. In its subject-\nmatter it recalls the dream-states of Debussy\u2019s\nPell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande and the violence of Richard\nStrauss\u2019s Salome. Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Duke Bluebeard\u2019s Castle is\nanother obvious forerunner, not least in matters\nof vocal style: the music springs from the verbal\nrhythms and accents. But Schoeck went his own\nway by adapting a century-old text in blank verse. \nThe German dramatist Heinrich von Kleist\ngave a radically new complexion to an Ancient\nGreek story. Set against the background of the\nTrojan Wars, the usual version has it that Achilles\nkills Penthesilea in battle and then falls in love\nwith her body. Kleist turns the situation virtually\non its head. First, his Amazon queen breaches a\ntribal rule by seeking Achilles out on the\nbattlefield. Having unseated Penthesilea from her\nhorse, Achilles throws down his weapons. The\nqueen is rescued and lapses into unconsciousness.\nWhen she comes to, she is told that Achilles is her\nprisoner, but not that this is true only figuratively.\nAn idyllic love-interlude is fraught with tragedy.\nThe Greek warrior once more challenges\nPenthesilea to combat. Her love abruptly turns\ninto hatred: as Achilles advances to meet her\nunarmed she unleashes her dogs, and her suitor is\ntorn from limb to limb. Recovering from a\nsustained trance, she kisses his maimed body,\nsurrenders her own weapons and dies of a broken\nheart.\nThe score of Schoeck\u2019s Penthesilea is not\nsymphonic; it has been aptly described as musical\nstagecraft. Schoeck\u2019s achievement was to find his\nown correlates for Kleist\u2019s extraordinary\npolarities and ambiguities, beginning with the\nharmonic pillars in the opening bars. Essential\nelements of the work are stated in the martial\norchestral prelude. And throughout the piece,\nSchoeck\u2019s evocative Klanggr\u00fcnde, the sonic\nfoundations, have the power to match the most\noutlandish effects Kleist devised. The unusual\norchestration includes two pianos as well as ten\nclarinets in various registers. The violins are\nrestricted to four solo instruments. The music\nwhich accompanies Achilles\u2019s loving\npronunciation of Penthesilea\u2019s name is coloured\nby tuned glasses stroked with a bow. A stierhorn\nrings out before Achilles\u2019s challenge to the\nAmazon queen.\nOne of the most striking aspects of Schoeck\u2019s\ncomposition is the highly differentiated use of\nspeech. Usually this is punctuated by orchestral\nchords, although sometimes the accompaniment\nis more extended. Moreover there\u2019s an\nintermediate stage between frei gesprochen and\nfully notated recitative, a stage where the rhythms\nbut not the pitches are notated. (Conventional\ntime-signatures appear only briefly.) Schoeck\u2019s\nuncertainty about the audibility of his spoken\npassages is reflected at that point where the\nAmazons, after rallying their troops, return to the\nfray. Here the score offers two priestesses\nalternative deliveries, the notes to be sung \u2018only if\nthe speaking voice lacks penetration\u2019.  \nNot surprisingly, one modern German\nproduction of Schoeck\u2019s Penthesilea skirted the\ntechnical difficulties by engaging a double cast of\nspeakers and singers. In Lucerne\u2019s semi-staged\nversion, the main characters continue to oscillate\nbetween speech and song. But in collaboration\nwith Hartmut Becker the conductor Mario\nVenzago restores to the cast the character of an\nAmazon Oberste or group-captain: one of the\nKleistian supporting roles which Schoeck\u2019s\nlibretto omits. This speaker has not only some\nlines that Schoeck gave to other Amazons, but\nalso a few of the many lines of narrative he\ndiscarded. (The CD booklet doesn\u2019t tell us so; it\ndoes, however, include the German libretto in\nBecker\u2019s adaptation.) Also in the avowed interests\nof verbal clarity are Venzago\u2019s rhythmic\nretouchings to Schoeck\u2019s score.\nThe title role is awesome. \u2018Half fury, half\ngrace\u2019 is Achilles\u2019s summing up of Penthesilea.\nDramatic power needs to be complemented by\nlyrical richness, and Yvonne Naef displays all the\nvocal qualities required. James Johnson\u2019s bullish\nAchilles packs a punch, lacking only that wit\nwhich Kleist bestowed on the character (and\nwhich, in the opera\u2019s first recording, was captured\nby Roland Hermann). The parts of the Chief\nPriestess and Prothoe, Penthesilea\u2019s principal\ncompanion, are sung with eloquence. In the non-\nSchoeckian part of the Oberste, Imke B\u00fcchel\ndeclaims her lines so raspingly that you want to\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f62\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nhand her a glass of water. But in the epilogue her\nspeech finally acquires a human softness. Mario\nVenzago draws compelling performances from\nhis Czech choir and Swiss orchestral forces.\nEvidently much thought had been given to tempo\nrelations, and for me the most outstanding\nfeature of Venzago\u2019s reading is the treatment of\nthose passages marked feierlich. As suggested by\nSchoeck\u2019s previous opera Venus, passion, for this\ncomposer, is as solemn as it is tempestuous.\nHerein lies the crucial difference between\nSchoeck\u2019s Penthesilea and Expressionist opera.\nThe contained sorrow which the crazed queen\nvoices in her lucid moments has perhaps no\nmusical equal.\nPeter Palmer  \nSAYGUN: Symphonies (complete); Violin Concerto1;\nSuite for Orchestra. 1Mirjam Tschopp (vln),\nStaatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz c. Ari Rasilainen. 3\nCDs available separately: CPO 999 819-2 (Symphonies\n1, 2), 999 968-2 (Symphonies 3, 5), 777 043-2 (Symphony\n4, Violin Concerto, Suite).\nTurkish music of the 20th century is often spoken\nof in terms of the \u2018Turkish Five\u2019, a group of\ncomposers which included Necil Kazim Akses\n(1908\u201399) and Cemal Resid Rey. The most\nimportant member of this group by far, and very\nprobably Turkey\u2019s finest classical musician ever, is\nAhmed Adnan Saygun (1907\u201391). His musical\nlegacy and international reputation ranks\nalongside that of Ernst Toch, Honegger,\nTcherepnin, Tansman and Wellesz as a major\nbulwark of the central European modernist\ntendency. It is gratifying indeed that the music of\nthis fascinating figure, whose cultural roots were\ndelicately suspended between the West and the\nNear East, should now have been subject to a major\nexploration by CPO (at the time of writing a\ndouble CD of the complete String Quartets is\npoised for release, also by CPO).\nSaygun\u2019s early years were spent in his native\nland and his thorough study of Turkish folk music\ninformed his own compositions, but the three\nyears he spent in Paris (1928\u201331) brought him into\ndirect contact at a crucial time with the music of\nStravinsky, Bart\u00f3k and of course the French\nimpressionists. His music of the 1930s and 1940s\nfeatured several operas on Turkish themes,\nincluding a large oratorio, Yunus Emre. It wasn\u2019t\nhowever until the early 1950s that Saygun wrote\nhis First Symphony. It is a wondrous blend of neo-\nclassical structure and embellished tritonic\nharmonic patterns: a comparison with the early\nToch symphonies of the same period shows some\nstriking similarities, although it isn\u2019t clear if they\nknew one another\u2019s music. (Unlikely, as by this\ntime Toch was resident in the USA.) The\nmysterious chorale figure of the slow movement\nbears testimony to Saygun\u2019s affinity with\nGregorian chant, overlaid with beguiling oriental\ninflections. The Second Symphony (1957) shares\nmany traits of the First, but the larger orchestra,\ngreater use of colour and freer rhythmic\nstructures and dance episodes point the way to his\nmaturing style.\nAll of Saygun\u2019s music is infused with harmonic\nand tonal ambivalence which gradually evolved\nfrom a cool classical style into a highly decorated\nByzantine language: this finds full expression in\nthe Third Symphony (1961), at nearly 40 minutes\nthe longest of the five. This work enjoyed some\ninternational exposure, culminating in a\nmemorable recording of a live performance at the\nLeningrad International Music Festival in 1988\nconducted by Fyodor Glushenko. Both that\nrecording and the present version capture the\nelectrically-charged, densely-argued orchestral\ndialogues of the first movement. Cascading\nostinati and clarion brass summonses yield to\nshimmering landscapes of low woodwind and\nstrings, illuminated by celeste and glockenspiel.\nThe mysterious chorale figuration frames the\nslow movement, another closely-wrought\nthrenody of enriched polymodal fabric. Like\nother modernists Saygun favours complex metres\nand irregular intersections of tempi which mirror\nhis often elusive harmonic evolution.\nThe Violin Concerto (1967) and the Fourth\nSymphony (1976) share many similarities with the\nThird Symphony, but the dark-hued Concerto is\nmore in the nature of a symphonic dialogue:\nrhetorical orchestral versicles are met with\nresponses either by soloist alone or with uneasy\npromptings from groups of instruments,\nsometimes in an awkward rhythmical gait. In the\nslow movement the soloist ploughs a lonely\nfurrow, with little approbation from the\ninstrumental ensemble except for the occasional\nanimated exchange. The large orchestra\ndominates rather than dwarfs, and it does so too in\nthe Fourth Symphony, a very Gothic work. Indeed\nthe opening movement (which like most other\nSaygun first movements contains the essence of\nthe whole work) is perhaps Saygun at his most\nconcentrated: the powerfully-built structures and\nheavily fortified foundations are the components\nof an imposing and impressive edifice.\nBy the time he wrote his Fifth Symphony\n(1984), Saygun was in his late 70s but the neo-\n\uf763\uf764 \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 63\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nclassical architecture, rhetorical demeanour,\nunresolved ostinati, tritonic dilemmas and rich\ncolour are still very much in evidence. This is an\nexcellent series by CPO to add to their\nmemorable cycles of music by Milhaud, Wellesz,\nFrankel, Searle, Petterson (and now Sallinen). We\nare treated yet again to their very high\nengineering and performance standards. It is hard\nto think of many other enterprises under way at\nthe moment which have brought so much rare\nand valuable music to the fore, and very great\ncredit is due all round.\nBret Johnson\nBARRY: In the Asylum. CLARKE: Piano Trio; Etude;\nIndependence: Part 1; Island; Isolation. FINNISSY: In stiller\nNacht; Independence Quadrilles; Necessary and More\nDetailed Thinking. Trio Fibonacci. NMC D107.\nTrio Fibonacci\u2019s new disc of Barry, Finnissy and\nClarke looks on paper a provocative\njuxtaposition, and so it proves: listening to these\nthree very different (not to say antithetical)\nmusical personalities placed cheek-by-jowl is as\nuncomfortable as it is stimulating. It\u2019s also rather\nunderstated as a programme: trios and solos, no\nmajor statements, all three composers indulging\nthe intimacy of the medium in a series of\nruminative essays.\nEven the normally excitable Gerald Barry is\nrelatively becalmed, though his trio In The Asylum\nhas its moments of more characteristically\nmaniacal energy. Unfolding episodically from a\nsequence of tantalizingly plain (even catechistic)\nrepetitions of a chromatic phrase in the violin, it\nfeels like a very thorough cut-up of something\nelse; its material, rhythmically stiff and\nproceeding principally by non sequitur, is either\narrayed palindromically across a section or\nrepeated over and over with ever-changing\ninstrumentation. The overall effect is attractively\nlow-key, as if the music being (dis-)assembled like\na jigsaw puzzle in thoughtful calm. Perhaps this is\nthe calm of the asylum (the laconic programme\nnote isn\u2019t giving much away): certainly the piece\nhas a fascinating air of eccentric studiousness.\nThe cutting-up and transforming of tonal\nmaterials also inform Michael Finnissy\u2019s trios In\nstiller Nacht and Independence Quadrilles, though\nmore explicitly so and to quite different effect. In\nstiller Nacht is a \u2018derangement\u2019 of Brahms\u2019s\nfolksong arrangement, in which each instrument\nindependently presents \u2018different views of\nBrahms\u2019s manner or style.\u2019 The violin preserves a\ncertain amount of Brahmsian syntax, while the\ncello presents a dodecaphonic elaboration, and\nthe piano alternates very dense and very bare\nsections, quoting opaquely from Brahms\u2019 trios.\nThe result is a gorgeous, lyric, half-tonal reverie,\nand the Fibonaccis create a beautiful clouded\ntexture, but I must admit I wanted more: more\ndefinition and differentiation of materials, more\ncharacterization and urgency in the playing. It\u2019s\ntempting to turn a piece like this into an evocative\nsoup, but isn\u2019t it more interesting to keep the\nvarious ingredients al dente? Independence\nQuadrilles fares better: it\u2019s the same principle of\nsimultaneous independent parts, applied to more\nsharply differing materials and divided into five\ndistinct sections (the quadrille dances) that\nalternate chromatic and tonal textures. This is\nmusic written in the true chamber spirit of\ndomestic enjoyment, and here the Fibonaccis\u2019\ncharacterization comes alive with variety and\nhumour. \nFinnissy\u2019s third contribution, a witty miniature\nentitled Necessary and More Detailed Thinking,\nsounds like sexed-up serialism (think Boulez\nunder the bedclothes); a rather piquant\njuxtaposition, perhaps, with the very serious\nHigh Modernism of James Clarke. Compared\nwith Barry and Finnissy, Clarke\u2019s pieces here seem\nboth traditional and quite conventional, with\ntheir Romantic spin on modernist complexity and\ntheir predilection for dark, brooding emotional\nand dramatic situations. This is well-mapped\nterritory, and Clarke only partially avoids the\npitfalls of gestural and structural clich\u00e9s that\nstrew his path. The Piano Trio begins in a\nfascinating half-world of tonal chimeras and\nglinting strings, but soon diverts into stock\nrhetorical manoeuvres that drown the piece in\nportentousness. The piano piece Island, however,\nsustains an oppressive heaviness that hangs over\nthe whole work until a stunning moment of\ndawning releases new colours. Other solo pieces,\nfor violin and cello, are perhaps less individual but\nallow the other Fibonaccis a chance to shine.\nOverall, this disc does the group proud: serious,\ncomplex music played with style, technical\nexcellence and musical empathy that betokens\nreal star quality. Let\u2019s hope they continue to\nexplore such challenging repertoire.\nJames Weeks\nSKALKOTTAS: Ballet Suite: The Sea; Four Images; Greek\nDance in C minor. MITROPOLOS orch.

Nikos\nChristodoulou. BIS-SACD-1484.\nIt is a curious irony that, having finally displaced\nByron Fidetzis\u2019 pioneering recording of the Greek\nDances \u2013 played by enthusiastic if unpolished\nplayers from the Urals \u2013 with their own (BIS-CD-\n1333\/4, reviewed in Tempo 199) BIS should draft\nhim in to take charge of their recording of\nSkalkottas\u2019s superb late ballet, The Sea (1948\u20139),\nand in Iceland, moreover. But the Icelanders have\nalready made a substantial contribution to the\nseries: the quality of ensemble and sheer pizzazz\nof their playing are undeniably greater. They\nclearly relish the unusual idiom and the joie de\nvivre that is characteristic of all the pieces on the\nfirst of these two latest additions to this\nenthralling series.\nSkalkottas\u2019s theatre scores have been a major\nfeature of the orchestral issues in BIS\u2019s series,\nwith those for (or extracts from) The Mayday Spell,\nThe Maiden and Death and The Gnomes previously\nfeatured.1 Fidetzis\u2019 disc includes two more, one \u2013\nThe Sea \u2013 intended as a dance score, the other\n(1948) \u2013 originally titled Little Dance Suite and Four\nGreek Dances for the Ballet \u2013 being perhaps a study\nfor the larger work, although ironically it reached\nthe stage under its final title of Four Images. The\nchange of name was well advised as these are not\nin any way a continuation of the great sequence\nof Greek Dances. Rather they are \u2013 as the original\ntitles suggest \u2013 structurally simpler pieces meant\nfor choreography while the earlier sets were\ncelebrations of the composer\u2019s folk heritage\n(albeit refracted through his personal aesthetic).\nTheir agricultural subjects, different for the most\npart to the evocations of place in the larger set,\nemphasize the difference in expressive purpose, in\na not-quite-seasonal cycle (autumn to autumn,\nperhaps): the \u2018Hay Harvest\u2019 leads via \u2018The\nSowing\u2019, \u2018Wine Harvest\u2019 (aka \u2018The Vintage\u2019) to\nwhat was originally called \u2018Dance of the Grapes\u2019\nbut by Fidetzis \u2018The Grape Stomping\u2019. Curiously,\nthe Four Images also appear on BIS\u2019s other new\nrelease, conducted by Nikos Christodoulou,\nwhere the finale is entitled \u2018The Wine-press\u2019.\nChristodoulou catches the Bacchic fervour of the\nthird and fourth movements more than Fidetzis,\nalthough the minute-long difference in their\nperformances is due mainly to the latter\u2019s much\nslower tempo for \u2018The Sowing\u2019. Why the Images\nalone should feature twice in the series is not\nexplained in either booklet.\nThe Sea is a much larger and stronger work\nthan the Images, cast in 11 numbers which\nillustrate a succession of scenes as if from a frieze.\nAfter a sturdy Moderato maestoso prelude, the\nmusic moves through a series of episodes\ndepicting naturalistic or supernatural aspects of\nthe sea, whether sailors (as in the second and\nfourth pieces, \u2018The Child of the Sea\u2019 and \u2018The\nTrawl\u2019), a tempest (the third, \u2018Dance of the\nWaves\u2019), sea creatures (Nos 6 and 7, \u2018The Little\nFish\u2019, \u2018The Dolphins\u2019) and a mermaid, who\nbecomes \u2013 along with Alexander the Great \u2013 the\nfocus of the final quarter of the ballet. The music\nis, like the vast majority of Skalkottas\u2019s output\nfrom 1944, tonal with a broadly nationalist\nflavour. In the notes, Kostis Demertzis notes the\nresonances of some mainstream Western musical\nexemplars in parts of the score; British listeners in\nparticular will pick up hints (entirely\nsubconscious on Skalkottas\u2019s part, I am sure) of\nArthur Bliss, in best Things To Come mode, in the\ncentral \u2018The Dolphins\u2019. What emerges is a work\nof great charm but rather less intellectual rigour\nthan the composer\u2019s more abstract concert\nworks; it is noticeable, for instance, how static\nharmonically the music in The Sea is compared to\nhis serial pieces. How The Sea would work on the\nstage as a consequence is an open question.\nFidetzis\u2019 couplings included an updated Greek\nDance in C minor and Skalkottas\u2019s student (1923\u20134)\norchestration of Dimitris Mitropoulos\u2019 vibrant\npiano piece Cretan Feast of five years before.\nAlthough the two men had very different artistic\nmissions, Mitropoulos approved of his\ncompatriot\u2019s arrangement sufficiently to conduct\nits premi\u00e8re in 1926 (and of course conducted\nother scores of his). As Demertzis comments, the\nC minor Greek Dance Dance is a very different\nproposition to those in the set of 36, almost a\nthrowback to an earlier manner: indeed, to the\nvery type of dance, typical of Brahms or Dvor\u02c7\u00e1k,\nthat one imagines Skalkottas particularly wanted\nto avoid in the 1930s. From the orchestration, the\nC minor Greek Dance is believed to date from 1949,\nbut whether this is another example of Skalkottas\nattempting a less personal style late on (hard to\nimagine why, when the other Greek Dances had\nbeen such \u2013 indeed his only \u2013 popular success) or a\nrejected off-cut from somewhat earlier is a mystery. \nWhile the first of these discs is (largely) relaxed\nand entertaining, then the second is the more\nchallenging and satisfying. The major component\nis the Second Piano Concerto in a dazzlingly\nvirtuosic account from Geoffrey Douglas Madge,\naccompanied by the BBC Symphony Orchestra.\nThe work\u2019s fearsome technical demands, like\nthose in the First and Third Concertos, seem to1 BIS-CDs -954, -1014 and -1364 respectively.\n\uf763\uf764 \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 65\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nhold no terrors for either soloist or orchestra\nwho, under Christodoulou\u2019s sensitive, purposeful\ndirection, provide a well-shaped interpretation\nthat suggests they had been performing the piece\nfor years. Just listen to the opening Allegro molto\nvivace to hear what I mean, but better still is the\nensuing Andantino. If the marking suggests\nsomething trifling or insignificant, what emerges\noff the page in Madge\u2019s hands is far from it: a\ncomplex, ambivalent movement (not least the\nway it plays tag with sonata form, the base\nstructure for the other two movements) full of\nrapt textures and fantastical landscapes. The\nconcluding Allegro moderato is perfectly\nproportioned to provide the concerto with a fully\nsatisfying, yet energetic finale \u2013 bearing out Hans\nKeller\u2019s famous view (after the 1954 premi\u00e8re\nbroadcast by the BBC) quoted in the booklet, that\nthe music is \u2018as romantic as all full-blooded music,\nand as classical as all great art\u2019. \nAs if that were not enough, the disc \u2013 issued as\na Super Audio CD \u2013 adds two further works (plus,\nas already mentioned, the more incisive of the\ntwo accounts of the Four Images): the delightful\nLittle Suite for strings (1942) and Tema con\nVariazioni (1949), which seems to be the last music\nSkalkottas penned, intended as the fifth\nmovement of the Second Orchestral Suite\n(previous sections of which have appeared\nalready in the series2). The orchestration of the\nfinal 66 bars was left unfinished (the booklet\ncontains a brief note on the straightforward task\nof completing it.) This was to be no interlude-\ntype structure, however, in the manner of, for\nexample, the variation middle movement of\nSibelius\u2019s Fifth Symphony (sublime as that is).\nRather, Skalkottas\u2019s piece is self-contained and\ncompressed, its 11-minute timespan suggesting a\ncomposition of much larger dimensions. The\nAndante theme and three variations (Allegretto;\nModerato; Allegro ritmato) function more like small\nmovements \u2013 not unlike those in Hindemith\u2019s The\nFour Temperaments \u2013 than variations per se, in the\nmanner of, say, Elgar\u2019s Enigma: the whole\nmovement has the feel of a suite in itself as much\nas being the component of one. Indeed, it is\nlonger and weightier than the Little Suite, whose\nthree movements, Allegro \u2013 Andante \u2013 Allegro vivo,\nare in an atonal style, but one free of note-rows or\nformulaic patterns. This is atonality with its most\nlistener-friendly face on. It is splendidly played, as\nare all the works on the disc, and the sound is\nspectacular.\nGuy Rickards\nCECILIA MCDOWALL: Seraphim; Dance the dark streets;\nDancing fish; Not Just a Place; Dream City; The case of the\nunanswered wire.

DUTTON Epoch CDLX 7159\nThis highly recommended disc builds on the\nsuccess of Dutton\u2019s superb collection of choral\nworks by Cecilia McDowall (CDLX 7159),\ndistinguished by a strikingly reflective setting of\nthe Magnificat and a sumptuously alluring Ave\nmaris stella.  \nWritten in memory of Adam Raphael,\nSeraphim (2001) is a brightly-hued concerto for\nsolo trumpet, strings and percussion. In the\nopening movement, \u2018Blow your trumpets\u2019, airily\ntextured strings chatter in half-Baroque, half-jazz\nlanguage, supporting the flexible trumpet solo,\nplayed with admirable technical security and\npoetic sensibility by Paul Archibald. The central\n\u2018Angells\u2019 is hauntingly memorable, with eerie,\nethereal whispering bowed crotales and string\nharmonics hovering above delicately searing\nsemitonal clashes between solo violin and muted\ntrumpet lines. The worldly finale, \u2018Imagin\u2019d\nCorners\u2019, is predominated by the soloist\u2019s\narpeggiated figures, punctuated by tom-tom\ninterjections. Increasingly florid solo lines drive\nthe work to a decisive conclusion.  \nDance the Dark Streets, a concerto grosso for\nstrings and piano obbligato, was inspired by\npoems about aspects of Scottish weather. In\n\u2018Haar\u2019, McDowall captures the drifting, looming\nquality of a chilly sea-mist, whilst the closing\nmovement dispels the mist with a bracing wild\nwind. Amid the wafting paragraphs of the finale,\nthe music relaxes for a tellingly wistful passage.\nJust before the final gusty bars blow out the\nmusic, there is a brief recollection of the previous\nmovement\u2019s mood of ominous calm, a quietly\neffective gesture.          \nA Russian fable by Ivan Krylov led to Dancing\nfish, for soprano saxophone and strings. The\nsoloist plays a fragment of Russian folksong in the\nopening section, and this recurs as the piece\ngathers momentum, progressing from flowing\ntranquillity to frenetic dancing. Conceived as a\nsingle beautifully-controlled accelerando, it ends\nwith a vigorously propulsive jig. Amy Dickson\u2019s\nsaxophone solo is alert to every shift in the music\u2019s\ncharacter, supported responsively by George Vass\nand his players.     \nConceived in homage to Astor Piazzolla, Not\nJust a Place is a highly-charged single-movement\nstructure for violin, double bass and strings.

They\ngradually untwine as the music marshals itself for\na final dance of defiance. Double bass slaps,\nstabbing accents and riotous glissandi turn up the\nheat.The grimly stalking ostinato in the lower\nstrings calls to mind the hulking bass line in the\nfinale of Andrjez Panufnik\u2019s Sinfonia Rustica:\nsomething of that great work\u2019s earthy passion\ninforms McDowall\u2019s torrid, sultry score. Soloists\nFreya Ritts-Kirby and Benjamin Griffiths capture\nperfectly the oppressive seductiveness of the\nmusic.               \nDream City, commissioned by the Presteigne\nFestival, is written for the same forces (flute,\nclarinet, harp and string quartet) as the Ravel\nIntroduction and Allegro, whose elegant spirit\nilluminates this delicately-traced musical\nresponse to the life and works of Paul Klee. In the\nevocative prelude-like movement, \u2018Method of\nmeasuring time\u2019, bright woodwind skirls\npunctuate the texture, adorning the underlying\nstring chords with pungent, irregular dabs.\n\u2018Walking the line\u2019 spotlights the first violin\u2019s\nconversational interactions with surrounding\ninstruments. The lyrical slow movement, inspired\nby Klee\u2019s \u2018Oriental\u2019 landscape \u2018Before the Snow\u2019,\nis characterized by gently rustling strings, whose\nundulations provide a backdrop to the vibrant\nsolos of flute, clarinet, harp and cello. The\nscherzo-like Finale, \u2018I had to dance\u2019, begins with\nangular, jagged dance-like patterns, but after a\nrepeat of the work\u2019s initial flourishes, the piece\nends magically as the final bars leave the City\nsuspended in the air. Dream City successfully pays\ntribute to Klee\u2019s interplay of line and colour; the\nplayers bring out the work\u2019s narrative strength,\nwithout losing sight of its bewitching sonorities\nand rhythmic diversity.\nThe Tippett Quartet are commanding and\npersuasive in The Case of the Unanswered Wire, a\nconcise, closely argued one-movement work\ninspired by Douglas Dunn\u2019s verse novel, \u2018The\nDonkey\u2019s Ears\u2019, which describes the life and work\nof a Russian engineer aboard ship at the time of\nthe 1905 Russo-Japanese war. Menacing\nmechanical figurations are frozen by the icy stasis\nof the grieving central section. The remorseless\nfinale resumes the mechanism of the opening\nsection, punctuated by hectoring Morse code\nsignals. The music falters into baleful silence as all\ncommunication is severed. Compact and\npowerful, the quartet is fuelled by more than a\nhint of Elizabeth Maconchy\u2019s gift for terse but\ntelling utterance in this medium. It is subtitled\n\u2018String Quartet no 1\u2019, fostering keen anticipations\nof further examples.\nThis winning release offers finely polished and\nwell-recorded accounts of some of Cecilia\nMcDowall\u2019s most compelling pieces.

Brouwer has a well-developed\naesthetic sensibility and the expressive powers of\nthis music and the other works (especially the\nbeautifully elegiac Remembrances) put this disc in a\nclass of its own. \nOf comparable merit is the record devoted to\nthe music of Marion Bauer (1882\u20131955) one of the\nearlier American female composers, who\nprobably hasn\u2019t had a recording nor many\nperformances since her death half a century ago.\nShe was not overly prolific; her music has a mid-\nWestern transparency of texture and a delicate\nand untroubled impressionistic demeanour, with\nPoulenc and Faur\u00e9 near to hand. The later\nAmerican Youth Concerto is a pastiche of vernacular\nstyles, and shows off a rare talent which this\nrelease has rescued from otherwise certain\noblivion.\nEarl Kim (1920\u201388) is perhaps the weakest link\nin the current chain: his music, whilst well-\ncrafted, doesn\u2019t seem to possess the strength of\ncharacter to give it a distinctive edge. This applied\nto the rather bland Violin Concerto\n(commissioned and recorded 25 years ago by\nItzak Perlman). For Cornet (1984), a setting with\norchestra of poems of Rainer Maria Rilke the\ncomposer uses a narrator rather than a vocalist:\nthis is a high-risk strategy,3 which can result in\nportentousness and tends to blunt the music\u2019s\nimpact. On the whole it is best left to Gettysburg\naddresses and other presentations by the CEO. \nI did not hold such reservations about Frank\nEzra Levy (b 1930), another composer totally\nunfamiliar to me until this release and another\nCD of his Symphony No. 4 (see MMC 2021). The\nson of the Swiss Composer Ernst Levy, Frank\nEzra Levy has his own distinctive style, very\ndynamic with clearly defined textures and\ncolourful orchestration. This is evident\nimmediately in the 1997 Summer Overture. Even\nmore impressive is the Stravinskian Rondo\nTarantella (2003). The composer speaks of his\nneo-classical leanings, doublings in fourths and\nfifths and concern with melodic and rhythmic\nintegrity of individual parts. The Third\nSymphony (1977) is an imaginative and varied\nwork for quite small forces, yet with an expansive\nAmerican feel, whilst the Cello Concerto No. 2\n(2002) is a welcome addition to a still small corpus\nof such American concertos. These engaging and\nvaried releases are an important paragraph in an\nongoing narrative which, hopefully, has many\nchapters yet to unfold.\nBret Johnson\n\u2018The Tend\u2019rest Breast\u2019: settings of women\u2019s poetry by\nQUILTER, BRIDGE, GURNEY, LENNOX BERKELEY,\nIRELAND, ALASTAIR KING, MADELEINE DRING,\nMONTAGUE PHILLIPS.

Neither Olive Mary Denson nor\nQuilter\u2019s setting of her \u2018Wild Cherry\u2019 will be\nfamiliar to many listeners. Madeleine Dring\nwrote her own text for the cabaret-like \u2018Don\u2019t play\nyour sonata tonight, Mister Humphries\u2019. The title\nphrase comes from \u2018Hesperus\u2019, one of seven\nSappho songs by Ivor Gurney to be included on\nthis CD (William Bliss Carman is not named as\nthe translator). Sappho also figures as primary\nsource of the first of Lennox Berkeley\u2019s Three\nGreek Songs.  \nMusically speaking, some typical shifts and\nmodulations in the Gurney settings are among\nthe most striking things on the disc. Alastair King,\nabout whom the booklet says nothing, brings a\nliterary sensibility and deft structural control to\nbear on three settings of Kathleen Raine. John\nIreland\u2019s \u2018Hymn for a child\u2019 (after Sylvia\nTownsend Warner) and \u2018Love and friendship\u2019\n(Emily Bront\u00eb) were intended for a medium-\nrange voice, but the soprano Georgina Colwell\u2019s\nfeeling for them shines through. Indeed her\nresponse to the words reinforces everything she\ninterprets, including the lighter music of\nMontague Phillips. Nigel Foster\u2019s sympathetic\nskills at the piano are a major plus, not least in\nFrank Bridge\u2019s \u2018Love went a-riding\u2019.\nUnfortunately the singer\u2019s flawed vocal\ntechnique is put under strain rather too often, and\nthe recording from a public hall in Walton-on-\nThames does nothing to compensate.

The other song, \u2018Now, O Now in this\nBrown Land\u2019, has been recorded by the Solaris\nQuartet in a transcription entitled Love\nRemembered. Here Moeran\u2019s setting of the text is\nundoubtedly the greater, but Geoffrey Stern\u2019s\nevocative \u2018Strings in the Earth and Air\u2019 has\nimaginative breadth.

Collegium COLCD\n130.\nWhen reviewing the \u2018New French Song\u2019 concert\nat the Purcell Room in July 2004 (see Tempo Vol.\n59 No.231, January 2005) which showcased a swift\nsuccession of impressive contributions from no\nless than 20 noteworthy current British\ncomposers, space did not allow for individual\nmention of each, but as a \u2018follow-up\u2019 I\u2019ve been\nendeavouring to watch out for interesting\ndevelopments among their ranks.\nThe youngest composer to have a premi\u00e8re in\n\u2018New French Song\u2019 was Tarik O\u2019Regan (born\n1978) with his piece Sainte (setting words by the\nsymbolist Stephane Mallarme) which, I\u2019ve just\nlearnt, went on to win the British Composers\nAwards vocal category in December 2005.\nFollowing a rather formal opening, this song\ndevelops more expressively with \u2018sympathique\u2019\nspread chords in the piano accompaniment.\nThis young composer, still in his 20s, currently\non a Fullbright Chester-Schirmer Fellowship in\ncomposition in New York after distinguishing\nhimself as a postgraduate in both Oxford and\nCambridge, has many prizes and commissions to\nhis name and has now capped it all with a most\nevocative new album: Voices, released in April this\nyear. This was previewed on BBC Radio 3\u2019s \u2018In\nTune\u2019 on 7 March. Listening in to the excerpts\nplayed, one was struck by the sheer immediacy of\nthe music and its sound that came across from\nO\u2019Regan\u2019s singers the Choir of Clare College,\nCambridge, with whom he had worked\npreviously in connexion with his time at the\nUniversity. \nThe full CD, predominantly recorded in the\nperfect acoustics of Watford Colosseum, with\nchorus director Timothy Brown and James\nMcVinnie (previously scholar at St Albans\ncathedral) at the organ, is quite remarkable in its\nimpact, combining a masterly clarity of vocal line,\noften within innovative structures, combined\nwith virtuoso percussion effects and imaginative\ninterweaving of harp and organ.\nHighlights include Three motets from Sequence\nfor St Wulfstan, and Two Upper Voice Settings, with\none for Midnight Mass 2003,which O\u2019Regan\nhimself describes in his CD notes as: \u2018ecumenical\nsentiment of stillness \u2026 sparsely accompanied\u2019. It\nis precisely this very economy and simplicity of\nline which marks his work out as distinctive and\ncompelling to the ear. His Dorchester Canticles\nalso impress, with an added touch of Manhattan\nrhythms in the heady, percussive, toccata-finale\nthat closes Deus Misereator. O\u2019Regan also includes\nhis Care Charminge Sleepe, for double choir, which\nremarkably retains superb clarity of line within\ntextural complexity, including a central quasi-\nfugal passage, after which the preceding opening\nsection returns again in a higher, more urgent,\ntessitura to denote death throes.\nJill Barlow\n\uf763\uf764 \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 69\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\n\u2018Contours\u2019: New and Recent Music for Clarinet by\nDONATONI, SMITH, UDUMAN, CAUSTON,\nROMANO, SCIARRINO, ERBER and FOX. Kate\nRomano (cl). Metier MSV CD 2074.\nWith Andrew Sparling\u2019s recent recital disc on\nNMC and now Kate Romano\u2019s new solo\ncollection, \u2018Contours\u2019, on Metier, fans of\ncontemporary clarinet repertoire will be feeling\nparticularly well served at present. If Romano\u2019s\ntastes are less catholic than Sparling\u2019s, that at least\nmakes for a more coherent programme, and her\nplaying is comparably brilliant: her focused tone\nand athletic clarity of technique serve her chosen\nmusic excellently, and her mastery of the many\nextended techniques required allows her to create\nsome aural magic even where the musical\nmaterial is on the thin side. William O Smith\u2019s\nfeeble Variants, for instance \u2013 a sort of musical\nswatch book \u2013 is only the most obvious proof on\noffer that unusual noises are no substitute for an\noriginal compositional premise. \nOf the stronger pieces, Donatoni\u2019s Clair is\nrefreshingly lacking in special effects, kept\nairborne instead by wonderful notes and an\nunabashed rhythmic and gestural exuberance.\nEqually interesting is Dillon\u2019s early Crossing Over,\nwhich integrates microtonal tunings to plangent\neffect and sustains a compelling dramatic line.\nSciarrino conjures five minutes of rapture in his\nLet Me Die Before I Wake, a fragile melodic line\nfluttering like dreaming eyelids over multiphonic\nwhisperings below. Romano unerringly captures\nSciarrino\u2019s unique atmosphere here, and creates\nan enigmatic envoi from Christopher Fox\u2019s\nindeterminate Generic Composition #7. \nJames Erber\u2019s substantial Strange Moments of\nIntimacy proves harder to fathom, a determinedly\nextended monologue of punchy d\u00e9tach\u00e9 notes,\nkey clicks and breath noises whose ultimate\npurpose remains inscrutable. Unfortunately there\nare no programme notes to explain what is going\non, nor what Strange Moments these are, since\nRomano has instead provided us with a long essay\non performance practice issues. Fair enough,\nperhaps, but what use is any performance practice\nwithout a consideration of the poetic and\naesthetic contexts for the music? Such negligence,\nhappily, is not apparent in her playing: all the\ncomposers represented must feel fortunate to\nhave so thoughtful and impressive an interpreter.\nJames Weeks\nMAXWELL DAVIES: De Assumtione Beatae Mariae\nVirigins1; Brass Quintet2; Beacons of Hope3;\nCommemoration Sixty4; Blind Man\u2019s Bluff 1, 5; Prayer of\nThanksgiving in Times of Terror6; A Sad Pavan for These\nDistracted Times7. 1London Sinfonietta c.

These are available, along with some new\nrecordings, through Davies\u2019s MaxOpus Music\nwebsite.4 Though composers such as Stockhausen\nand Michael Torke have similarly purchased their\nback catalogue, Davies has embraced more fully\nthe potential of the Internet as a means of\ndisseminating his music. Whereas Stockhausen\nand Torke\u2019s websites sell pre-existent CDs,5\nMaxOpus Music offers customers the chance to\nchoose exactly which tracks they wish to purchase.\nCustomers can either buy individual works (MP3,\nWMA and AAC formats), sensibly priced by\nlength, or, for a fixed fee, create their own CD of up\nto 74 minutes in duration. \nThe two custom-made CDs sent to Tempo are\nall of previously unavailable works; all but one of\nthese recordings are from live concerts. The\nchoice of pieces hints at the scope of Davies\u2019s\ncompositional output, from music theatre to\noccasional pieces; they are also indicative,\npresumably, of the standard of performances we\nare to expect from future additions to the\nMaxOpus stable. \nTwo of the most substantial works on these\ndiscs are recordings from the 2005 festival \u2018Max: A\nmusician of our time\u2019. The masque Blind Man\u2019s\nBluff (1972), blends nursery rhyme, dance, mime\nand ritual in a enjoyably bathetic reworking of the\nfinal scene of Georg B\u00fcchner\u2019s Leonce and Lena. De\nAssumtione Beatae Mariae Virginis (2001) is a 30-\nminute single-movement reflection, for large\nchamber ensemble, on the notion of the Virgin\nMary physically ascending to heaven.

Both pieces were given committed readings\nby the London Sinfonietta under Oliver Knussen\u2019s\nbaton; Lucy Shelton and Claire Booth\u2019s\nperformance as Jester and King respectively in\nBlind\u2019s Man Bluff are equally assured. \nAn even more virtuosic performance can be\nfound in the Wallace Collection\u2019s studio recording\nof the Brass Quintet (1981). Here, Maxwell Davies\ntreats the genre with the same seriousness and\nsense of purpose as one finds in his string quartets;\nsimilar, too, is the detailed exploration of colour\nand contrapuntal play. These demands also inform\nA Sad Pavan for These Distracted Tymes (2004),\nwritten for, and recorded at, an International\nString Quartet competition. The Pavan, as well as\nthe occasional Prayer of Thanksgiving in Times of\nTerror (2005), returns eloquently to one of the\ncentral themes of Davies\u2019s opera Taverner,\nreligious intolerance.\nThe remaining works on the disc belong to the\nmore functional side of Davies\u2019s output. Written\nfor, and recorded at, a concert commemorating\nthe sixtieth anniversary of the ending of World\nWar II, Commemoration Sixty and Beacons of Hope\n(both 2005) are examples of Davies\u2019s lighter, more\npopulist style. The former work is the lengthier,\ndraws on vast massed forces and is\nstraightforwardly pictorial. Three invented\nnational anthems battle it out, Ives-like, between\nthe assembled ensembles; after a hymn for peace\nand a medieval carol, the three are transposed to\nthe same key and demonstrated to be able to work\ntogether musically. Though the political\nmetaphor is somewhat obvious, the second half in\nparticular has a peculiar charm. Though Davies\nhas often been criticized for this sort of superficial\nmusic, such criticisms are not always fair:\noccasional music such as Commemoration Sixty has\na different purpose to, say, Eight Songs for a Mad\nKing and must be judged by somewhat different\ncriteria. In this light, I\u2019m sure it did its required job\non the day, though I doubt the somewhat\nambivalent ending, which suggests that peace is\nboth relative and remains something to be striven\nfor, was lost on Tony Blair and the other assembled\ndignitaries in the audience.\nMy real reservation about Commemoration Sixty\nand Beacons of Hope lies in the quality of their\nperformances, particularly with the latter. The\nmilitary bands have neither the rhythmic precision\nnor accuracy of intonation to be found in the\nother offerings on the CDs. MaxOpus does allow\none to hear a sample of music before purchasing it;\nrecordings such as these seem to be thankfully the\nexception rather than the rule. \nDavies\u2019s ongoing Naxos project continues\napace with the release of recordings of the middle\nworks of the set, the Fifth and Sixth Quartets.\nWhere the Fourth Quartet explored \u2018Children\u2019s\ngames\u2019, the Fifth takes its lead from the play of\nlight from \u2018The Lighthouses of Orkney and\nShetland\u2019 on the sea and shore at night. This is\nrealized musically by another of Davies\u2019s\nseascapes; here, themes announced by the cello at\nthe outset are led through a variety of moods,\ntextures and tonal regions. The restriction of the\nnumber of themes results in a better balance\nbetween the creation of aurally striking ideas and\nunfolding structure than can be found in, say, the\nmore diffuse Fourth Quartet. The second and final\nmovement is a slow \u2018double\u2019 of the first, finding in\nthe material and form new expressive potential.\nThe compression of the Fifth Quartet stands in\ncontrast to the more expansive six movements of\nthe Sixth. The study of Beethoven\u2019s late quartets\nmakes its mark in this multi-movement design\nthat balances the profound (the adagio fourth\nmovement) with the naive (the second and fifth\nmovements, both wearing plainsong influence\nlightly). The lyrical adagio is the heart of the work,\nand though it is no Cavatina (sc. Beethoven\u2019s op.\n130), Davies does not come out too bruised from\nsuch a comparison. The outer movements are\nmore forceful, the first in a pleasingly blustery\nmanner; the Presto third movement is a busy\nscherzo with calm trio. Compared to the first five\nquartets, the Sixth makes greater use of tonal\nassociations, which serve to throw the more\nastringent passages into sharp relief.\nThe Fifth and Sixth Quartets both contain\nnumerous passages that bristle with the\nimagination and fecundity of the opening\ninstalments of the cycle. Nevertheless, increased\nfamiliarity with the previous quartets diminishes\ntheir overall freshness and vitality: one gets the\nfeeling of treading old ground, albeit it new and\ninteresting ways. Whether this proves sufficient to\nsustain the impetus of the cycle all the way\nthrough to the Tenth Quartet remains to be seen; I\nfor one sincerely hope so. \nEdward Venn\n\uf763\uf764 \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 71\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nFor a free online sample visit:\nwww.journals.cambridge.org\/jid_TCM\nEditors\nChristopher Mark, University of Surrey, UK\nAllan Moore, University of Surrey, UK\nLaunched in 2004, twentieth-century music is a unique\npublication dedicated to leading research on all aspects of\nthe music of the twentieth century -a period which may be\ninterpreted flexibly to encompass, where appropriate, music\nfrom the late-nineteenth century to the early years of the\ntwenty-first.
