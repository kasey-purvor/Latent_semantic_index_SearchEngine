In 2004, OI types V and VI were added to this classification\nbecause of specific clinical\/radiological and\/or histological features,\nabsence of abnormalities of type I (pro)collagen synthesis or structure\non gel electrophoresis and absence of causative variants in the\nCOL1A1\/2 genes.4,5 With the discovery of rare recessive genetic causes\nof OI (see Table 1), it was proposed to extend the classification with\nOI types VII and VIII.6 However, the classification and subdivision\ninto different types of OI is still under discussion1 because the\nphenotypic spectrum that results from mutations in some of these\ngenes is almost as broad as that with mutations in type I collagen\ngenes. There is also debate as to whether Bruck syndrome type I7\nand II,8 characterized clinically by bone fragility and congenital\ncontractures of the large joints, should be classified as a type of OI.\nBiosynthesis of type I collagen\nMost individuals affected with OI are heterozygous for a causative\nvariant in either of the two genes, COL1A1 or COL1A2, which encode\nthe proa1(I) and proa2(I) chains of type I procollagen, respectively.\nType I collagen is the major structural protein in bone, tendon and\nligament. Recently, rare recessive genetic causes of OI have been\ndescribed and, in all but one, the identified genes encode proteins\ninvolved in the biosynthesis of type I procollagen (Figure 1, Tables 1\nand 2).9,10\nGenes, proteins and causative variants\nAutosomal dominant OI. The most common form of OI in most\npopulations is OI type I. Cultured dermal fibroblasts from affected\nindividuals produce about half the normal amount of type I procolla-\ngen molecules, which have normal structure. OI type I usually\nresults from variants in one COL1A1 allele (frameshift, nonsense\nand splice-site alterations) that lead to mRNA instability and hap-\nloinsufficiency.

Type I collagen is the major structural protein in\nbone, tendon and ligament. It is first synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) as type I procollagen, containing C- and N-terminal propeptides.\nIn the rER, the two a1(I)-collagen chains encoded by COL1A1 and the one a2(I)-collagen chain encoded by COL1A2 comprising predominantly Gly-X-Y\ntriplets, align and assemble in the C- to-N direction to form a triple helix. During folding, collagen is modified by, among others, specific enzymes that\nhydroxylate lysine and proline residues and glycosylate hydroxylysyl residues. This process is called post-translational modification and it stops when triple\nhelix assembly is complete. The CRTAP\/P3H1\/CyPB complex encoded by the CRTAP, LEPRE1 and PPIB genes, is responsible for the 3-hydroxylation of\nP986 (p.P1164 counting from the methionine that initiates translation) but will most likely also act as a cis-trans isomerase and a molecular chaperone.\nFKBP65 encoded by FKBP10 also acts as a molecular chaperone for type I procollagen. The protein product of PLOD2 (procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate\n5-dioxygenase 2) hydroxylates telopeptide lysines in the rER. HSP47 encoded by SERPINH1 is thought to maintain the stability of the triple helix. After\nfolding, the procollagen molecules are transported through the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane (PM) into the extracellular matrix (ECM) where\ncleavage of the N-and C-terminal propeptides occurs and collagen molecules aggregate to form fibrils.\nEMQN best practice guidelines\nFS van Dijk et al\n12\nEuropean Journal of Human Genetics\ncoding-domains or insertion\/deletion events that lead to in-frame\nsequence alterations. Most of these variants result in synthesis of\nabnormal type I procollagen molecules characterized by post-transla-\ntional over-modification of the triple-helical domain, which results in\nalterations visible by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Loss of\nexpression of either gene because of large-scale deletions appears to be\nrare.11\u201315 More than 1000 distinct variants in the COL1A1 and\nCOL1A2 genes have been identified that cause OI (R Dalgleish:\nOsteogenesis Imperfecta Variant Database (https:\/\/oi.gene.le.ac.uk,\naccessed 3 May 2011).16,17\nAutosomal recessive OI including Bruck syndrome\nIn the last 5 years, candidate\u2013gene approaches have identified several\nloci in which causative variants have been identified which result in\nthe long-sought causes for recessively inherited forms of OI (see\nFigure 1, Table 2). We classify these genes in four groups\u2014(i) one\nin which the genes encode proteins that contribute to the initial phase\nof chain recognition and propagation of molecular folding (CRTAP,\nLEPRE1 and PPIB)18\u201326 the second in which the genes encode proteins\ninvolved in the final quality control of type I procollagen (FKBP1027\u201329\nand SERPINH130), the third, which involves a gene encoding proteins\ninvolved in late modification and crosslink formation (PLOD28,31)\nand the fourth group, which involves recently recognized genes\nencoding proteins involved in bone cell differentiation (SP732 and\npossibly SERPINF133).\nReasons for referral\nPrenatal. Prenatal ultrasounds showing abnormalities suggestive of\nOI (diminished mineralization of skull, platyspondyly or bowing,\nshortening and\/or fractures of long bones) are an important reason for\nreferral for molecular diagnostics of OI.\nPostnatal. Radiographs at birth suggestive of OI, recurrent and\/or\nunexplained fractures with or without suspicion of non-accidental\ninjury (NAI), primary (idiopathic) low bone mass, preferably with\nexclusion of secondary causes, a family history of OI and request for\nconfirmation of the clinical diagnosis are all reasons for referral for\nmolecular diagnostics of OI. However, in some cases dentinogenesis\nimperfecta or even blue sclerae might be the only reason for referral.\nAs such, physicians from many specialties (gynaecologist, paediatri-\ncian, orthopaedic surgeon, clinical geneticist, general practitioner,\ndentist, ear nose throat specialist, endocrinologist, internist and\nophthalmologist) might refer a patient for molecular analysis.\nDepending on the age of presentation, OI can be difficult to distin-\nguish from some other genetic conditions, for example, Ehlers\u2013Danlos\nsyndrome arthrochalasis type (former EDS VIIA and B), isolated\nTable 2 Characteristics of recessive OI-related genes\nGene Protein Protein function\nResults of biochemical analysis in\ncase of causative variants OI type\nCRTAP18\u201321,26 Cartilage-associated\nprotein (CRTAP)\nCRTAP forms a complex with the proteins encoded by\nLEPRE1 and PPIB.

Many referrals for OI diagnostics occur in the\ncontext of suspected NAI in an attempt to exclude a genetic cause of\nfractures. Fractures resulting from NAI occur in 24 per 10 000 children\nunder 3 years of age whereas the OI prevalence is 1 per 10 000\u2013\n20000.34 The incidence of OI among children evaluated for NAI is\n2\u20135%.34 Differentiation is aided by an experienced clinician and\nradiologist familiar with OI36 as the nature and localization of\nfractures in OI and NAI can often be distinguished.37 However,\nbecause injuries may involve infants before many of the clinical\nfeatures of OI are apparent, laboratory diagnostics for OI can certainly\nbe helpful in this differentiation.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA group of clinicians and scientists involved in OI diagnostics met on 28\u201329\nJune 2010 at a workshop in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to formulate Best\nPractice Guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of OI supported by the\nEuropean Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN).\nRESULTS\nDiscussions focussed on diagnostic flow, methodologies, inter-\npretation of results and reporting. Consensus guidelines were\nestablished.\nDISCUSSION\nThe diagnostic flow\nThe \u2018traditional\u2019 way to establish or confirm the diagnosis of OI is\nbased on studies of collagens synthesized by cultured dermal fibro-\nblasts. Previous studies35 demonstrated that either quantitative or\nqualitative alterations can be identified in about 90%38 of individuals\nwith clinically confirmed OI. Biochemical analysis will separate\nindividuals with quantitative defects (OI type I), from those with\nqualitative defects (OI types II\u2013IV) because of causative variants in the\nCOL1A1\/2, CRTAP, LEPRE1, PPIB genes and those with no abnorm-\nalities detected. Electrophoretic analysis of type I procollagen may also\nidentify other disorders that can mimic some aspects of OI: EDS\nkyphoscoliotic type (type VIA), EDS arthrochalasia type (types VIIA\nand VIIB) and EDS dermatosparaxis type (type VIIC).11 Also,\ncultured fibroblasts provides a resource for the analysis of RNA\nsplicing and unclassified variants. However, biochemical analysis will\nnot identify some quantitative defects of type I procollagen, certain\ncausative variants that alter sequences in some coding regions of the\nCOL1A1\/COL1A2 genes and recessive forms of OI (including Bruck\nsyndrome) that result from variants in FKBP10, PLOD2, SERPINF1,\nSERPINH1 or SP7. Furthermore, prenatal diagnosis by biochemical\nanalysis is only possible in chorionic villus cells and is effective with\nqualitative alterations9 but unsuitable for quantitative defects and\ndelays time of diagnosis by 2\u20134 weeks compared with genetic analysis.\nIn contrast, direct genomic analysis (sequencing) of the known\ngenes should identify causative variants in 495% of affected indivi-\nduals in most populations.39,40 Next generation sequencing has gained\nimportance in the laboratory diagnosis of OI \u2013 in part because of\nshorter time to diagnosis and in part because of the added value of the\ninformation as well as reduced costs, which is important for the\nprecise determination of recurrence risk (autosomal dominant versus\nrecessive), prenatal diagnosis and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.\nGiven these considerations and current facilities, the consensus of\nthe EMQN Best Practice in OI meeting was to initiate laboratory-\nbased diagnostic studies with direct genomic sequencing of the type I\nprocollagen genes, COL1A1 and COL1A2. The approach to diagnosis\nis detailed in Figure 2. It was agreed that the \u2018traditional\u2019 approach can\nstill be used in the context in which genomic DNA sequencing is\nunavailable or the financial barriers are high. Moreover, analysis of\nproteins and mRNA\/cDNA from cultured fibroblasts remain valuable\ntools for follow-up studies.\nExplanation of diagnostic work flow\nSequencing of all type I procollagen gene exons. Procollagen type I\ngene sequencing should identify causative variants in 90% of affected\nindividuals,39,40 provided that the clinical diagnosis of OI is accurate.\nIn some cases a follow-up study is needed to determine whether a\nvariant is causative. This will often include genetic studies in the\nparents with correlation to the phenotype observed in the parent, or\nanalysis of mRNA splicing and protein-based biochemical studies on\ncultured dermal fibroblasts.\nIf no causative variant in the COL1A1\/2 genes is identified by\nsequence analysis, the next step is to determine if a deletion or\nduplication of some or all of the coding regions of either gene has\noccurred. Strategies such as array-based analysis, MLPA or qPCR if\nproperly validated are considered equivalent by the working group in\ntheir detection of such alterations. From currently available data in the\nrepresented laboratories, the added causative variants expected from\nthis approach should be about 1\u20132%. In case of OI types II\u2013IV, after\nidentifying the causative variant in the index patient, determination of\nparental mosaicism by sequence analysis of DNA from blood from\neach parent will provide data for genetic counselling with respect to\nrecurrence risk and care in subsequent pregnancies.\nRe-review of clinical data and the question of NAI. When no causative\nCOL1A1\/2 variant is found, clinical priorities should be re-considered.\nFailure to find a causative variant occurs if there is technical failure, or\nif no causative variant is present in these genes (because of causative\nvariants in other (un)known genes or because the patient does not\nhave OI). Therefore, referring physicians should be encouraged to\nprovide a completed clinical checklist (Supplementary Table 1) and\nX-rays of the patient. This clinical\/radiological information should be\nreviewed by a clinical geneticist or a clinician with experience in OI.\nThis can help to determine the likelihood of OI in the particular\npatient. With clear evidence of OI, further analysis should proceed\n(Figure 2).\nHowever, if the primary reason for genetic study is to identify\nchildren with OI among the larger group suspected for NAI, analysis\ncan reasonably stop after COL1A1\/2 sequencing unless there is a\nstrong suggestion of consanguinity or recessive inheritance. Justifica-\ntion of this decision rests on the following considerations. First,\nprevious studies indicate that fewer than 5% of infants studied for\nsuspicion of NAI are found to have OI by biochemical or DNA-based\nstudies.34 Second, DNA-based analysis will identify a causative variant\nin490% of all individuals with OI39,40 so that the remaining risk that\nan infant has OI, will be about 0.5%. Third, at present all infants\nwith recessive OI have obvious radiographic abnormalities fitting a\ndiagnosis of OI and not of NAI.\nIdentification and characterization of causative variants in autosomal\nrecessive OI. Variants in the genes causing recessive OI are estimated\nto account for about 5 or 6% of individuals with OI. This represents\nthe pooled estimates from all the laboratories represented at the\nworkshop. Although laboratory context and clinical criteria may in\nEMQN best practice guidelines\nFS van Dijk et al\n14\nEuropean Journal of Human Genetics\nsome cases require otherwise, the preferred strategy is to analyse all\ngenes at the same time to minimize turnaround time. If no, or only\none, causative variant is identified by sequence analysis, the next step\nis to determine by array-based analysis, MLPA or qPCR if a deletion or\nduplication of some or all of the coding regions of either allele has\noccurred. Once recessive causative variants are identified, parental\nconfirmation of carrier status should be completed, first to confirm\nthat the causative variants in the index case are inherited in trans and,\nsecond, to exclude the possibility of uniparental disomy in the case of\nhomozygosity in the infant.\nAnalysis of proteins and mRNA\/cDNA from cultured fibroblasts\n(functional analysis). By following the guidelines to this point,\nvirtually all causative variants in type I procollagen genes and in the\nrecessive OI-related genes will have been identified. However, in some\ncases analysis of proteins and mRNA\/cDNA from cultured fibroblasts\ncan have an additive value. First of all, mRNA\/cDNA analysis provides\na tool for studying the effect of unclassified variants suspected to alter\nsplicing. Moreover, this approach can unravel the effect of deep\nintronic variants that alter the mRNA sequences usually by conversion\nof cryptic exons to active exons and which would not be detected by\ngDNA sequencing. In these cases, biochemical analysis of type I\nprocollagen chains can detect quantitative defects if the new exon\nresults in introduction of a premature stop codon and nonsense-\nmediated mRNA decay, or qualitative defects if the mRNA is stable\nand translated into an abnormal protein. When OI type I is suspected,\nbut genomic DNA sequencing is unavailable or too costly, COL1A1\nnull-allele14 testing on cDNA can be used to confirm the diagnosis.\nHowever, this approach relies on the availability of informative\nmarkers and will not lead to the identification of the disease-causing\nvariant.\nAnalysis of remaining samples. Some diagnostic laboratories main-\ntain research arms and the identification of the additional OI-related\ngenes has profited from the repositories of cells and DNA samples\nfrom individuals with OI because of unknown genetic causes. This\npractice should continue and cells and DNA samples should be\nbanked for future analysis. If the diagnostic laboratory does not\nmaintain such a resource, banking with ones that do, should be\nconsidered.\nLaboratory diagnosis of OI\nMolecular analysis for OI. Molecular analysis for OI includes sequen-\ncing or mutation scanning and deletion\/duplication testing for\nCOL1A1 and COL1A2, followed by sequencing of recessive OI-related\ngenes (see Table 1). Preferred material for testing is genomic DNA\nfrom blood, but other sources can be used as well (see Tables 3a and b).\nFor general issues regarding sample labelling and identification,\nsequence analysis and interpretation see \u2018Practice guidelines for Sanger\nSequencing Analysis and Interpretation\u2019 (http:\/\/www.cmgs.org\/BPGs\/\npdfs%20current%20bpgs\/Sequencingv2.pdf).\ngDNA and cDNA sequencing\nCurrent practices in sequencing of the type I collagen genes differ\namong laboratories in that some use exon-by-exon amplification\nfollowed by sequence determination (Supplementary Appendix Tables\n3A and B) and others use a multi-exon substrate for analysis. If\nproperly validated, both will provide the same mutation capture\nprobability and their use should be determined by local preferences.\nTo identify splice variants, primer sequences for PCR used for direct\nsequencing should be designed far enough from intron\u2013exon bound-\naries to allow reading of the branch sites, consensus splice donor and\nacceptor sites or UTR sequences of acceptable quality. With regard to\nsequence analysis of cDNA, large fragments should be analysed to\nallow detection of multi-exon deletions, because these could be missed\nwhen primers are located close to the exon junctions at multiple sites.\nThe analysis of cDNA from fibroblasts is warranted when an unknown\nvariant is found that might affect splicing. In addition, cDNA\nsequence analysis may detect null-alleles without a known cause (eg,\nan unknown variant in the promoter region) if care is taken to analyse\nregions in which coding sequence heterozygosity is known.\nReportCausative variant\nSequence analysis and\nquantitative\nanalysis of COL1A1 and\nCOL1A2 on genomic DNA\nConfirmed causative\nvariant(s) or second\ncausative variant found\nSegregation and\nfunctional analysis\nNo causative variant\nRe-evaluation of clinical\ndiagnosis OI\nNon-confirmed\nNon-confirmed\ncausative variant(s) or\nno second causative\nvariant found\nNo\nfurther\ntesting\nneeded\nConfirmed\nAnalysis of recessive\ngenes\nReport and banking\nof samples\nfor researchNo causative variant\nFigure 2 Preferred diagnostic flow in OI. The approach to diagnosis is designed to maximize the likelihood that causative variants will be identified in all\naffected individuals or assign those without causative variants to research pools. This flow assumes that the clinical diagnosis of OI is well established\naccording to the traditional diagnostic criteria. With clear evidence of OI from radiological and clinical examination, further analysis should proceed\naccording to the proposed strategy. Functional analysis consists of analysis of proteins and mRNA\/cDNA from cultured fibroblasts and also includes COL1A1\nnull allele testing in certain selected cases.\nEMQN best practice guidelines\nFS van Dijk et al\n15\nEuropean Journal of Human Genetics\nQuantitative analysis\nQuantitative analysis by MLPA (kits for COL1A1 and COL1A2 have\nbeen designed by MRC-Holland, available at http:\/\/www.mlpa.com)\nand qPCR is particularly important in cases without a detected\nmolecular cause in which only genomic DNA is available and without\nheterozygous polymorphic variants detected by sequencing. Recently,\ncomplete COL1A1 allele deletions have been reported to cause OI\ntype I.13 For reliable quantitative testing (MLPA\/qPCR) patient and\ncontrol materials from the same source (eg, blood or fibroblasts)\nshould be used for comparison and the same DNA purification\nprotocol should be used for all samples within a test series.\nProtein analysis. Protein analysis of type I (pro)collagen (Supple-\nmentary Appendix Figures 3A\u2013D) is used to detect quantitative and\nqualitative changes. The method used for this analysis is based on in\nvitro labelling of collagen in cultured fibroblasts, followed by electro-\nphoresis on 2M urea SDS-PAGE gels (the 2M urea enhances chain\nseparation) and autoradiography.41 The analysis of procollagens is\nachieved by omitting the pepsin digestion step from the collagen\nprotocol. Procollagen electrophoresis enhances detection sensitivity of\nquantitative type I (pro)collagen defects (OI type I), visualizes defects\nin type I (pro)collagen located in the N-terminal region of the type I\ncollagen triple helix more clearly and distinguishes between EDS VIIC\nand EDS VIIA and B (if samples are analysed after labelling in the\npresence and absence of dextran sulphate to enhance proteolytic\nprocessing).42\nPrenatal diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis is possible in case of identifi-\ncation of known disease-causing variant(s) both on genomic DNA\nextracted from chorionic villus sample (CVS) cells and amniocytes.\n\u2018Testing for Maternal Cell Contamination (MCC) in Prenatal Samples\nfor Molecular Studies\u2019 (http:\/\/www.cmgs.org\/BPGs\/pdfs%20current%20\nbpgs\/MCC_08.pdf) should be applied. In those rare instances when\npost-translational over-modification of (pro)collagen type I is visible\nin, for example, cells from an affected sibling but no disease-causing\nvariant(s) have been detected in the genes involved in OI, electro-\nphoresis of type I (pro)collagen from cultured CVS cells can be used\nfor prenatal diagnosis. Amniocytes are good sources of DNA but they\ndo not make type I procollagen in sufficient abundance to permit\nprenatal diagnosis.\nInterpretation of performed diagnostics\nFor the interpretation of an observed sequence variant it is essential to\nestablish the causal role of the variant in the pathogenesis of the\ndisease. Textboxes 1 and 2 include descriptions of variants in the genes\ninvolved in OI that are likely to be pathogenic or that should be\nconsidered as unclassified variants.\nReporting\nGeneral information on requirements for variant reporting can be\nfound in the OECD Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Molecular\nGenetic Testing (http:\/\/www.OECD.org\/dataoecd\/43\/6\/38839788.pdf)\nand in the guidelines issued by the Swiss Medical Genetics Society\n(http:\/\/sgmg.ch\/user_files\/images\/SGMG_Reporting_Guidelines.pdf).\nReporting scenarios\nFinding a causative variant in the COL1A1\/COL1A2 genes in an affected\nindex case. The report should state that a causative variant has been\ndetected and that this confirms the clinical diagnosis. The report\nshould include a description of the reason why a particular variant is\nconsidered causative. Determination of the parental origin of the\ndetected variant(s) should be advised. Testing of relatives at risk\nshould be offered in conjunction with appropriate counselling.\nIn the case of severe\/lethal OI because of a causative variant in\nCOL1A1 or COL1A2, the measured recurrence risk is 2% after the\nbirth of one affected child. The recurrence risk is increased after the\nbirth of two affected individuals, presumably because the proportion\nof germ cells that carry the mutation is higher.43 This information may\nbe mentioned in the results letter. If parental mosaicism can be\ndemonstrated in the father, the referring clinician could be encouraged\nto request a sperm sample from the father to clarify the risk.\nWhen the referring physician is not a clinical geneticist, it is\nrecommended that the patient be referred to a clinical genetics centre\nfor counselling. Referral to OI centres for therapy can be proposed if\navailable.\nNot finding a causative variant in COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes in an\naffected index case. If no causative variant is detected in the COL1A1\nand COL1A2 genes after gDNA analysis and screening for large gene\ndeletions (eg, MLPA), an interim report can be made with the\nrecommendation for review of the original patient diagnosis (detailed\nclinical information, eg, with use of the clinical checklist, radiographs,\ncontact with the referring physician (see Supplementary Appendix\nTable 1)). This review of the clinical diagnosis should involve a\nclinician with expertise in diagnosis and classification of OI.

If applicable, a new request for additional testing\nshould be sent by the referring physician to the laboratory. Laboratories\nthat do not offer analysis of the recessive genes should suggest further\nanalysis in another laboratory.\nIn the case of doubtful pathogenicity of the identified variant, the\n\u2018Practice guidelines for the Interpretation and Reporting of Unclassi-\nfied Variants (UV\u2019s) in Clinical Molecular Genetics\u2019 (http:\/\/www.\ncmgs.org\/BPGs\/pdfs%20current%20bpgs\/UV%20GUIDELINES%20\nratified.pdf) should be applied. If the genetic testing procedure has\nidentified an unclassified variant as the only sequence change, this\nshould be reported as such. However, the report should clearly state\nthat the clinical significance of the variant is unknown and that its\nidentification does not provide an explanation for the clinical pheno-\ntype of the patient.\nFinding causative variants in the CRTAP, LEPRE1, PPIB, FKBP10,\nSERPINF1, SERPINH1, PLOD2, SP7 genes in an affected index case. The\nfinal report should state that causative variants have been detected. It is\nnecessary to investigate the carrier status of the parents and siblings in\norder to determine whether a variant is causative. Testing of relatives at\nrisk may be offered in conjunction with appropriate counselling. Such\ntesting might be useful for prenatal diagnosis.\nFinding one causative variant in the CRTAP, LEPRE1, PPIB, FKBP10,\nSERPINF1, SERPINH1, PLOD2, SP7 genes in an affected index\ncase. When one causative recessive variant has been detected, it\ncannot be excluded that a second causative variant has been missed,\nfor example when it concerns a deep intronic variant. Dependent on\nthe laboratory, a second interim report can be made indicating the\ndesirability for cDNA and protein analysis of type I (pro)collagen in\nthe case of one causative variant in the CRTAP, LEPRE1 or PPIB genes.\nWhen these additional tests are not informative or cannot be per-\nformed in the laboratory, the final report should state that it is not\npossible to confirm the clinical diagnosis OI by biochemical and\/or\nmolecular testing.\nNot finding causative variants in the CRTAP, LEPRE1, PPIB, FKBP10,\nSERPINF1, SERPINH1, PLOD2, SP7 genes in an affected index\ncase. In the case of doubtful pathogenicity of the identified variants,\nthe same procedure as described above for the COL1A1 and COL1A2\ngenes should be followed. In the case where no causative variants in\nthe genes involved in recessive OI have been found, the final report\nshould state that it is not possible to confirm the clinical diagnosis OI\nby biochemical and\/or molecular testing.\nNot finding causative variant(s) in the genes known for autosomal\ndominant and autosomal recessive OI: type I (pro)collagen electropho-\nresis. Reports of these studies are necessarily more descriptive than\nthe DNA-based results. They should list the types of genetic alterations\nthat could not be identified. When low production or post-transla-\ntional over-modification of type I (pro)collagen is observed, the\ndiagnosis of OI can be confirmed and in the case of over-modification\nof type I (pro)collagen, prenatal diagnosis on chorionic villus cells is\npossible. In reports concerning cells and samples with no molecular\nand\/or biochemical diagnosis of OI, it should be stated that it is not\npossible to confirm the clinical diagnosis OI.\nPrenatal or preimplantation genetic diagnosis\nPrenatal or preimplantation genetic diagnosis with the intention of\nterminating a pregnancy or not selecting embryos carrying the\ncausative variant(s) is possible in the case of identification of known\ndisease-causing variant(s). This service should only be offered in a\nclinical genetics service and must be accompanied by appropriate\ngenetic counselling. Requests for prenatal or preimplantation diag-\nnosis should always be referred and announced in advance to a clinical\ngenetics service. In addition, the original result letter of the laboratory\nthat identified the causative variant should accompany the request.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBest practice guidelines have been established for the molecular\ngenetic diagnosis of OI. The most noteworthy issue is that molecular\nanalysis of the COL1A1\/2 genes is recommended as the starting point\nin the diagnostic flow as opposed to protein analysis. It is to be\nexpected that molecular genetic testing in OI will only gain in\nimportance as new OI-genes are discovered and with the development\nof new technologies. However, in certain selected cases protein analysis\nwill remain important.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nFunding for the Best Practice Meeting was provided by the European Molecular\nGenetics Quality Network (http:\/\/www.emqn.org).\n1 van Dijk FS, Pals G, van Rijn RR, Nikkels PGJ, Cobben JM: Classification of\nosteogenesis imperfecta revisited.

Causative variants \u2013 considerations specific for the fibrillar collagen genes:\nThe following variants are likely to have pathological consequences for the protein function:\na. Substitution of the glycine residue of every Gly-X-Y triplet repeat within the triple-helical region of the a1(I)- and a2(I)-collagen chains.\nb. Sequence variants in consensus acceptor and donor splice sites (positions +1, +2, \u00031, \u00032) will lead to splicing errors of the mRNA, but the outcome cannot be\npredicted without cDNA analysis, with the exception of \u00031G4A acceptor-site splicing variants in the triple-helical region of the a1(I) collagen chains which result in a\nframeshift, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and a null-allele. \u00031G4A splicing variants of exon 6 of the COL1A1 gene, results in skipping of exon 6, whereas for the\nCOL1A2 gene this results in use of a cryptic splice site in the exon and an in-frame deletion of 15 bases. Both are associated with EDS arthrochalasis type.\nc. Nonsense mutations or deletions and insertions that result in interruption of the reading frame, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and a null-allele.\nd. In-frame deletions and insertions that lengthen or shorten the a-chains.\ne. Other variants* with experimental evidence (published or own data) of their impairment of the protein\u2019s function.\n*Variants also should be checked against existing entries in the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Variant Database16,17 (https:\/\/oi.gene.le.ac.uk), which can be used for corroboration.\nHowever, it should be recognized that the data in the database are not warranted to be accurate or fit for any particular purpose.\n2. Unclassified variants (UV)\na. All other sequence variants must be considered as \u2018unclassified\u2019 until segregation within the family has been investigated and\/or functional evidence becomes available.\nb. It is strongly recommended that intronic nucleotide substitutions other than splice-site mutations affecting the \u00031, \u00032 or +1, +2 intronic nucleotide positions be\nexamined by cDNA-analysis to determine their splicing outcome.\nc. It is strongly recommended that UVs be further investigated by in silico analysis (eg, PolyPhen-2, SIFT, Human Splicing Finder software, and so on). Of note: the new\nversion of Polyphen classifies almost all glycine substitutions as benign or tolerated.\nEMQN best practice guidelines\nFS van Dijk et al\n18\nEuropean Journal of Human Genetics\nTextbox 2\nInterpretation of variants in the CRTAP, FKBP10, LEPRE1, PLOD2,\nPPIB, SERPINF1, SERPINH1 and SP7 genes.\nCRTAP, FKBP10, LEPRE1, PLOD2, PPIB, SERPINF1, SERPINH1 and SP7\n1. Causative variants\nThe following variants are likely to have pathological consequences for the protein function:\na. Sequence variants in consensus acceptor and donor splice sites that will lead to splicing errors of the mRNA.\nb. Nonsense mutations or deletions and insertions that result in interruption of the reading frame, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and a null-allele.\nc. Most in frame deletions and insertions that lengthen or shorten the protein.\nd. See 1e in Textbox 1\n2.
