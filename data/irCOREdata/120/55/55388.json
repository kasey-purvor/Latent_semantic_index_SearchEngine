Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al   \n \n 2 \nIntroduction \n \nMethanol and iron are two key \nparameters to be monitored in vinegar. \nMethanol is always present in vinegar; \nit is not formed by the acetification \nprocess but exclusively by enzymic \nhydrolysis of the methoxyl groups of \npectins during wine fermentation [1]. \nThe methanol content depends on the \nextent to which solids from grapes, \nespecially the skin, which has a high \npectin content, are macerated. Vinegar \nfrom red wines has a higher con-\ncentration of methanol than white \nwines. The toxicity of methanol is well-\nknown -following ingestion, it is \noxidized, producing formaldehyde and \nformic acid, both of which are toxic to \nthe central nervous system. Formalde-\nhyde causes deterioration of the optical \nnerve, causing blindness. The dangeous \nlevels is LD50=350 mg Kg-1 [1]. The \npresence of iron in vinegars is mainly a \nresult both of contamination by contact \nwith ferrous materials during manu-\nfacture, and the iron in the wine from \nwhich the vinegar has been made. The \niron content, which depend on the \nmatrix, can cause hazes or even serious \nalteration of appearance and colour as a \nresult of interaction with phenol \ncompounds. \nThe official method for the analysis \nof methanol content of vinegar is gas \nchromatography using a split-type \ninjector and a flame ionisation detector \n[2]. A usual method consists of \noxidation of the analyte to formalde-\nhyde by potassium permanganate in \nphosphoric medium and spectrophoto-\nmetric monitoring at 575 nm of the \nproduct from the specific reaction of \nformaldehyde with chromotropic acid \n[3]. The official method for the deter-\nmination of iron in vinegar is direct \nmeasurement by flame atomic absorp-\ntion spectrometry (FAAS) [4]; another \nmethod is based on reaction with \npotassium thiocyanate and monitoring \nof the reaction product at 508 nm. The \nsame procedure is used for wines [5].  \nNo simultaneous, sequential, or \nindividual flow-injection method for \ndetermination of both methanol and \niron in vinegar has been reported in the \nanalytical literature. Some references \ncan be found on the determination of \niron in wines, and some of them use \nflow injection in an attempt of \nautomation. Neira et al. [6] developed a \nmethod for online sample preparation \nby use of sequential-injection analysis; \nwhich was based on complexation of \niron with 1,10-phenanthroline and \nphotometric detection at 520 nm. \nPulido-Tofino et al. [7] used a fluo-\nrescent sensor to determine iron-\npyoverdin immobilised on controlled-\npore glass that reacted selectively with \nFe(III), reducing its fluorescence emis-\nsion. Cladera et al. [8] proposed a \nmethod based on the catalytic effect of \nthe iron(III)-ethylenediaminetetracetic \nacid complex on the oxidation of \nhydroxylamine by dissolved oxygen \nwith spectrophotometric detection. \nOnly two methods using flow injection \nfor determination of methanol in wine \ncan be found in the analytical literature. \nOne recent method is based on the use \nof a pervaporation module for the \nAnal. Bioanal. Chem., 2002, Vol. 374, 120-125   \n \n 3\nseparation of methanol and other \nvolatile species from wine before their \nindividual separation and determination \nby GC-FID [9]. For this purpose, the \nupper chamber of the pervaporation \nunit is located in the loop of an HPLC \ninjection valve and the pervaporated \nspecies were transported by an He \nstream to the chromatograph by \nchanging the valve to the injection \nposition. The other method is based on \nthe use of an alcohol oxidase electrode \n[10] located in a continuous-flow \nsystem. \nThe aim of this research was the \ndevelopment of a flow-injection meth-\nod for sequential determination of \nmethanol and iron in vinegar, to enable \nfast and inexpensive determination. No \nsimilar sequential or simultaneous, \nmethods for these species have pre-\nviously been reported. \n \nExperimental \n \nApparatus and instruments  \nThe manifold used is depicted in Fig. 1.  \nIt was built using two four-channel \nGilson Minipuls-3 peristaltic pumps \n(Villiers le Bel, France) fitted with rate \nselectors, three Rheodyne 5041 injec-\ntion valves (Elkay, Galway, Ireland), \none of them used as a selecting valve, \nPTFE tubing of 0.5 mm i.d. (An\u00e1lisis \nV\u00ednicos, Tomelloso, Spain) and a \nTeflon minicolumn of 5 mm i.d. and 6 \ncm length filled with active carbon. A \nCary 50 Conc spectrophotometer from \nVarian (Mulgrave, Australia) equipped \nwith a Hellma 138-QS flow-cell \n(Hellma, Jamaica, NY) and connected \nto a computer with Cary WinUV v.2.0 \n\u00ae (Varian) software for data collection \nand treatment was also used.  \nAn SBS model TFB-1 Selecta \n(Barcelona, Spain) thermostat, a labora-\ntory-made pervaporation module, de-\nscribed elsewhere [11-13] and PTFE \nmembranes of 47 mm diameter and 1,5 \nmm thickness (Trace, Braunschweig, \nGermany) were used. Statistical treat-\nments were made using Statgraphics\u2122 \n2.1 plus for windows.  \n \n \nFigure 1. Manifold for the determination of methanol and iron.

Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al   \n \n 4 \nA Varian 3900 Gas-chromatograph \nwith flame ionisation detector (FID) \nwith a Chrompack capillary column \nCP-wax-57 CB (50 m 0.25 mm i.d.), \nboth from Varian, and connected to a \ncomputer with Star chromatography \nworkstation v.5.52 \u00ae (Varian) software \nfor data collection and treatment was \nused to obtain methanol reference data.  \nA Distillatore Elettronico Eno-\nchimico (Gibertini, Milan, Italy) based \non water steam dragging was used for \nmethanol distillation.  \n \nReagents and solutions \nStandard solutions for calibration, opti-\nmisation and characterisation studies of \nthe methods were prepared from me-\nthanol (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) \nand iron (III) nitrate (Panreac, Barce-\nlona, Spain).  \n \nProposed method  \nThe acceptor stream in the pervapo-\nration module was an aqueous solution \nof 5 g L-1 potassium permanganate and \n50% (v\/v) phosphoric acid, both from \nPanreac. K2S2O5 (Panreac) solution (20 \ng L-1) was used to decolour surplus \npermanganate and 0.3 g L-1 p-rosaniline \n(Panreac) solution was also used for \nmethanol determination. Hydrochloric \nacid (5% v\/v) and potassium thio-\ncyanate solution (45 g L-1), both from \nPanreac, was used for iron determi-\nnation. Activated carbon from Aldrich \n(Steinheim, Germany) was used to \ndecolour the sample before filling the \ninjection valve and a 3% hydrogen \nperoxide solution was used for sample \npretreatment (Fe+2 to Fe+3 transfor-\nmation). \n \nReference methods \nHydrochloric acid (37,5%), hydrogen \nperoxide solution (3%) and potassium \nthiocyanate solution (200 g L-1), all \nfrom Panreac, were used for iron \ndetermination. The reference method of \nmethanol used 4-methyl-2-pentanol \n(Merck) as internal standard; this \ncompound (1110.0 mg, accuracy of 0.1 \nmg) was dissolved in 5% aqueous-\nethanol and the solution was then \ndiluted to 1 L in a volumetric flask. The \nmethanol reference solution was \nprepared by dissolving methanol (50.0 \nmg, accuracy of 0.1 mg) in 5% aqueous \nethanol (1L); 1 mL internal standard \nsolution was added to 10 mL of the \nmethanol reference solution. NaOH \nsolution (Panreac; 40% m\/v) was also \nused.  \n \nProcedures \n \nReference method for methanol [2]  \nThe sample was neutralised with a 40% \n(m\/v) sodium hydroxide solution. The \ninternal standard solution (1 mL) was \nadded to the neutralised sample (10 \nmL) and 1 \u03bcL of the mixture was \ninjected into the chromatograph. Injec-\ntor and detector temperatures were \n250\u00baC. The oven temperature was \nmaintained at 50\u00baC for 6 min, then \nprogrammed at 8\u00baC min-1 to 70\u00baC, \nwhich was held for 14 min, then \nprogrammed at 8\u00baC min-1 to 210\u00baC, \nwhich was held for 16 min. The carrier \ngas flow was 10 mL min-1. \nAnal. Bioanal.

The spectrophotometer was \nadjusted to zero by using an acidified \nsample of 10 mL wine diluted with 1 \nmL of distilled water as a blank \nsolution to compensate the influence of \nthe colour of the wine.    \n \nTable 1.

The methanol was pervaporated \nand collected in the acceptor solution \ncontaining potassium permanganate and \nphosphoric acid, valve IV1 remaining in \nthe filling position for acceptance of the \nvolatile fraction into a static acceptor \nsolution. At the same time the sample \nstream leaving the donor chamber was \ndecoloured   by   passage   through   an  \n \nactive carbon minicolumn and directed \nto valve IV2, which was in its filling \nposition. The selecting valve (SV) was \nin position (1), thus establishing the \nbaseline for the determination of iron. \nThree minutes after introduction of the \nsample into the donor chamber, the \ncontent of IV2 was injected into an acid \nstream of potassium thiocyanate and the \nreaction product monitored at 508 nm. \nSV was then switched to position (2) to \nestablish the baseline for the deter-\nmination of methanol. After an interval \nfor sufficient enrichment of the static \nsolution with the pervaporated species \nJ. Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al   \n \n 6 \n(5 min from sample introduction), valve \nIV1 was switched to the injection \nposition and the plug merged with a \nK2S2O5 stream to decolour the excess of \npermanganate, and then with a p-\nrosaniline stream to yield a violet \nproduct which was monitored at 567 \nnm. An aqueous stream was introduced \nbetween analyses in order to clean the \ndonor chamber of the pervaporation \nunit. \n \nResults and discussion \n \nOptimisation of the variables affecting \neach individual method was performed \nby use of both univariate and multi-\nvariate approaches, as required, depend-\ning on the interdependence of the \nvariables. The range over which the \nvariables were studied and the optimum \nvalues found are given in Table 1. \n \nOptimisation of the method for the \ndetermination of methanol \n \nChemical variables \nA multivariate approach was used for \noptimisation of the concentration of \nKMnO4 and H3PO4 within the ranges 1-\n20 g L-1 and 1-60% (v\/v), respectively; \nthe results obtained are plotted in Fig. \n2(a). The signal increased when the \nconcentrations of H3PO4 and KMnO4 \nwere increased but the former had a \ngreater effect. Concentrations of 5 g L-1 \npotassium permanganate and 50% (v\/v) \nphosphoric acid were selected as \noptimum. Concentrations higher than \n60% phosphoric acid were not tested \nbecause of deterioration of the pumping \ntubes. Because the P-value in the \nANOVA table was <0.01%, there was a \nstatistically significant relationship be-\ntween the variables at 99% confidence \nlevel. The equation of the fitted model \nis: A= -0.493 + 0.010 [KMnO4] + 0.030 \n[H3PO4]. The other chemical variables \nwere studied by use of the univariate \nmethod.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.

Chem., 2002, Vol. 374, 120-125   \n \n 7\nIncreasing the concentration of p-\nrosaniline increased the analytical \nsignal, which levelled off at p-\nrosaniline concentration of 0.3 g L-1. \nThe concentration of K2S2O5 used to \ndecolour the acceptor solution before \nmixing with the p-rosaniline solution \nwas also optimised. A 40 g L-1 solution \nwas sufficient for this purpose. \n \nFlow injection and pervaporation \nvariables \nFlow-rates q3 and q4, in Fig. 1 \n(corresponding to the acceptor and \ndonor stream, respectively, reaching the \npervaporator) were set at the same \nvalue in order to prevent membrane \ndeformation. A flow-rate of 1.4 mL \nmin-1 was selected as a compromise \nbetween sensitivity and sampling-rate \nand the sample was introduced in a \ncontinuous way in order to increase \nsensitivity.     \nReactors R1 and R3 had the function \nof ensuring proper mixing of the \nchemical reagents and pervaporated \nanalyte before reaching the spectro-\nphotometer. The length required for this \nfunction were 75 and 150 cm, respec-\ntively. \nBecause of the low methanol \ncontent of the sample, the efficiency of \nthe pervaporation was favoured by \nstopping the acceptor solution during \nthis step, thus achieving a higher \nenrichment by a mass-transfer closer to \nequilibrium. The pervaporation time, \nduring which the acceptor solution \nremained static, was tested between 1-8 \nmin; the analytical signal increased as \nthe time was increased, because \nefficient pervaporation was favoured. A \nvalue of 5 min was chosen as a \ncompromise between sensitivity and \nsampling rate.  \nIncreasing the temperature had a \npredictable positive effect on pervapo-\nration and on the analytical signal as a \nconsequence. The signal obtained at \n85\u00baC was lower than that at 90\u00baC, but \nthe reproducibility was better (2.35 mg \nL-1 at 85\u00baC compared with  3.03 mg L-1 \nat 90\u00baC). For this reason, the tempera-\nture of the thermostat was set at 85\u00baC. \n \nOptimisation of the method for the \ndetermination of iron \nPreliminary attempts to use a mono-\nchannel manifold with the reagent \nsolution acting as the carrier into which \nthe sample was injected resulted in a \ncalibration plot with a narrow linear \nrange, because of the low dispersion of \nthe injected plug into the reagent \nstream. For this reason, a water stream \nwas used into which the sample, \ncoming from the low chamber of the \npervaporation unit, was injected and \nmerged with the potassium thiocyanate \nsolution as shown in Fig 1. Several \nconditions were optimised using this \nmanifold. \n \nChemical variables \nThe concentrations of both thiocyanate \nand hydrochloric acid were optimised \nin the range 10-50 g L-1 and 1-15% \n(v\/v), respectively, using a multivariate \napproach. Figure 2(b) shows a plot of \nthe absorbance against both thiocyanate \nand hydrochloric concentrations. \nJ. Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al   \n \n 8 \nBecause the P-value in the ANOVA \ntable is less than 0.01, there is a \nstatistically significant relationship \nbetween the variables at 99% \nconfidence level. The equation of the \nfitted model is: A= -0.107 + 0.045 \n[HCl] + 0.035 [KSCN]. The optimum \nvalues were those providing the highest \nsignal with the lowest reagent con-\nsumption. \n \nFlow injection variables \nThe length of reactor R2 was varied \nbetween 50 and 200 cm and the highest \ntransient peak was obtained when the \nlength was 100 cm, as a result of \nappropriate mixing of the merged \nstreams with minimum dispersion. \nThe flow-rates of channels q5 and \nq6 were tested in the range 0.4-2.0 mL \nmin-1; the optimum values were 1.25 \nand 0.4 mLmin-1, respectively.  \nThe transient signal provided by the \nsystem increased as the injection \nvolume was increased from 50 to 300 \n\u03bcL and then became constant. \n \nCharacterisation of the method \n \nCalibration plots \nIn a first stage, five individual standard \nsolutions for each analyte were prepar-\ned containing concentrations between 0 \nand 1000 mg L-1 for methanol and \nbetween 0 and 20 mg L-1 for iron. Both \nsets of solutions were injected in \nduplicate and the range of linear \ndependence of response on concen-\ntration was found for each analyte. \nSubsequently new calibration plots \nwere obtained by use of standards \ncontaining both analytes. The regres-\nsion equations were Y=0.104 X +0.009, \nr2=0.998 and Y=5.5x10-3 X +0.003, \nr2=0.987 for iron and methanol, \nrespectively. \nDifferent iron-methanol ratios were \ntested to check for the absence of \nmutual effects. Iron did not interfere in \nthe determination of methanol, because \nof the involatile nature of the former, \nwhich also ensures its concentration is \nunaltered during heating the sample in \nthe pervaporation module or filtration \nthrough  the active carbon micro-col-\numn. No statistically significant dif-\nference between the results of the \nindividual and joint calibrations. \n \nAssessment of the proposed method \nThirty different vinegars in different \nstages of fermentation were used in the \nassessment study. Each result for \nmethanol or iron content was the \naverage from three determinations and \noutlier values were deleted by applying \nthe Grubs test [14]. The procedure for \nassessment consisted of studying ana-\nlytical parameters such as linear range, \ntraceability by the reference method, \nrepeatability, reproducibility, detection \nand quantification limits and sample \nthroughput. A robustness study was \nalso developed.  \n \nRepeatability (r).The F-test was \nused to establish if the difference \nbetween the repeatability of the \nproposed and reference methods was \nsignificant. With this aim, the Fobs=Sr2 \n\/ Sref2 was compared with the F1-\u03b1 \nobtained from F tables for \u03b1=0.05 \nAnal. Bioanal. Chem., 2002, Vol. 374, 120-125   \n \n 9\n(P=95%).

The method is \nsimple, presents good correlation with \nthe reference methods and can be easily \nimplemented in a winery for quality \ncontrol of the final product, thus \nconstituting an alternative to the \nchromatographic analysis usually re-\nquired. The method is robust and has a \nsample throughput higher than that of \nthe reference methods. An additional \nadvantage of the method reported here \nis its easy automation. This method \nconstitutes a unique sequential ap-\nplication of flow injection for deter-\nmination in vinegar and offers the \nadvantage of determining two \nparameters using the same manifold, \nthus reducing time and costs. This is the \nfirst time that a continuous simulta-\nneous method for determining iron and \nmethanol is proposed and assessed for \nits routine use in wineries. \n \nAcknowledgement \n  \nThe Spanish Comisi\u00f3n Interministerial \nde Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CICyT) is \nthanked for financial support (Project \nBQU 2000\/0241). \n \nReferences \n \n(1) P Ribereau-Gayon, Y Glories, A \nMaujean, D Dubourdieu, Hand-\nbook of Enology, Volume 2, The \nChemistry of Wine.
