INTRODUCTION\nHigh-K(5( iV i) isomers in the Hf-W-Os nuclei with A\n\u2019180 arise due to the presence of many high-j and high-V\norbitals near the Fermi surface @1#. For these axially de-\nformed nuclei, the projection of the total angular momentum\nonto the nuclear symmetry axis K is approximately con-\nserved. Consequently, the K selection rule governs the decay\nof the K isomers so that transitions from high-K to low-K\nbands are strongly hindered. These transitions, in practice,\ncan proceed by admixture of K values. In rotating nuclei, the\nCoriolis interaction changes the spin orientation to lead to a\nDK561 mixing. On the other hand, shape fluctuations to-\nwards g deformation can couple states with K quantum num-\nbers differing by two units (DK562 mixing!. In this con-\ntext, of special interest have been the surprisingly low\nhindrances for the very large DK transitions @2\u20134#. So far,\ndifferent mechanisms including Fermi-aligned Coriolis K\nmixing @3,5\u20137#, g tunneling through the potential barrier\n@2,4,8,9#, and the statistical K mixing due to high level den-\nsity @10# have been proposed for these transitions.\nThe hindrance factors per degree of K forbiddenness in\nthe decay of highly excited K isomers in the heavier osmium\n(Z576) isotopes @2,11,12# are typically much smaller than\nthose observed in the hafnium isomers (Z572) @13#. With\nthe increased number of protons, the nuclear shapes become\nsofter towards g distortion. Furthermore, it is reported that\nthe triaxial shapes appear at high spins in 184,186Os @14,15#.\nTherefore, the g-deformation degree of freedom, which in-\ntroduces a substantial K mixing as stated above, is expected\nto play an important role in the reduction of the K conserva-\ntion in the heavier osmium nuclei.\nPrior to the present study, a 20-ns Kp5101 isomer was\nknown in 184Os @2#. A recent study also revealed detailed\nlevel structure especially for high-spin positive parity states\nin this nucleus @14#. Although there are predictions @14# that\nnegative parity intrinsic states based on multiquasiparticle\nexcitations are near the yrast line, less experimental evidence\nis available for such states. In this paper, we report on new\nnegative parity states including Kp592 and (132) bands, a\n48-ns four-quasiparticle high-K isomer, and higher-seniority\nstates.0556-2813\/2002\/65~6!\/064310~12!\/$20.00 65 0643II. EXPERIMENTS\nHigh-spin states in 184Os have been populated in the\n170Er(18O,4n) reaction at a beam energy of 85 MeV. A 2.0\nmg\/cm2 170Er target enriched to 95.88% with a 10 mg\/cm2\nlead backing was bombarded by an 18O dc beam derived\nfrom the 12UD tandem accelerator at University of Tsukuba.\nThe target was thick enough to stop recoiling residuals. The\nbeam energy was optimized for production of 184Os (4n exit\nchannel! and 183Os (5n exit channel!. Nine Compton-\nsuppressed HP-Ge detectors, placed at 37\u00b0 ~two detectors!,\n79\u00b0 ~2!, 101\u00b0 ~2!, and 143\u00b0 ~3! with respect to the beam axis,\nwere used to detect in-beam g rays. In addition, one LEP\ndetector at the angle of 79\u00b0 was employed to increase detec-\ntion efficiency for low-energy photons. A total of 23108\ncorrelated g-g-time events within 200 ns were collected. A\ncomplementary data set was obtained at the Japan Atomic\nEnergy Research Institute ~JAERI!. The same reaction de-\nscribed above was used. 12 Compton suppressed HP-Ge de-\ntectors placed at angles of 32\u00b0 ~two detectors!, 58\u00b0 ~2!, 90\u00b0\n~4!, 122\u00b0 ~2!, and 148\u00b0 ~2! were used to collect approxi-\nmately 13108 g-g coincidence events. Both the data were\nseparately sorted into two-dimensional g-g matrices. For\nanalysis of isomers, g-g matrices with different time condi-\ntions were also created.\nIn order to determine transition multipole orders ~dipole\nor quadrupole!, DCO ~directional angular correlation from\noriented states! ratios @16,17# were extracted from the\nTSUKUBA data set. Here, the ratios are defined as\nRDCO5\nIg at 37\u00b0 ~or 143\u00b0 ! gated on gG at 79\u00b0 ~or 101\u00b0 !\nIg at 79\u00b0 ~or 101\u00b0 ! gated on gG at 37\u00b0 ~or 143\u00b0 !\n.\nSince the angle of 101\u00b0 ~143\u00b0! is equivalent to that of 79\u00b0\n~37\u00b0! @17#, the corresponding events can be summed when\nthe DCO matrices are created. In the DCO analysis, stretched\nDI52 transitions close in the level scheme to the g ray of\ninterest are generally used as gates. In this case, the DCO\nratios fall close to unity for stretched quadrupole (DI52)\nand unstretched dipole (DI50) transitions, and RDCO;0.6\nfor stretched dipole (DI51) transitions. For mixed DI51\ntransitions, the DCO ratios depend on the mixing ratio d.\u00a92002 The American Physical Society10-1\nT. SHIZUMA et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 65 064310FIG. 1.

RESULTS\nSince a detailed study of 184Os has recently been pub-\nlished @14#, here the focus is on additional negative parity\nstates that we found. Figure 1 shows the proposed partial\nlevel scheme resulting from the present work. Newly ob-\nserved bands are labeled as band I and band II instead of the\ndeduced K values. Note that the placement of 180, 231, 421,\n580, 661, and 669 keV transitions are different from that of\nRef. @14#. The ground state band, and the Kp5101 band\nbased on the n$9\/21@624#11\/21@615#% two-quasiparticle\nconfiguration were known up to high spins @2,14,18#, but\nonly the lower-spin members concerning the decay of a new\nisomer observed in this work are shown. The levels in g\noctupole bands Kp552 and 62 two-quasiparticle states\nwere also previously known @2,14#. The two Kp582 bands\nbased on the n$9\/21@624#7\/22@503#% (812 band! and\nn$9\/21@624#7\/22@514#% (822 band! two-quasiparticle con-\nfigurations are confirmed and extended to higher spins from\nthose reported in the previous work @14#. Table I summarizes\nenergies, intensities, and DCO ratios for the g-ray transitions\nin 184Os shown in the level scheme ~Fig. 1!.06431A. Band I\nThree g rays ~164, 194, and 301 keV! have newly been\nfound to deexcite a 2301 keV level into the Kp582\n2 and 62\nbands. The DCO ratio (RDCO50.3460.03) for the 194 keV\ntransition is consistent with a DI51 radiation. In addition,\nbased on the g-ray intensity balance, a total conversion co-\nefficient of the 194 keV transition was obtained as aT\n50.6560.10, which agrees with an M1 multipole\n@aT\ncal(M1)50.88, aTcal(E1)50.07]. The 2301 keV state,\ntherefore, is confirmed as a Kp592 state. A rotational band\n~band I! built on this state has been observed. Weak DI51\ntransitions connect the two signature sequences at lower\nspins. The spin assignment for the higher-lying levels is\nbased on the DCO ratios, and confirmed by interband transi-\ntions from and into the Kp562, 81\n2\n, and 82\n2 bands.\nB.

This transition, however, cannot be sepa-\nrated from the intense Ka1 x-ray line in Os isotopes, and\npossibly has a large conversion factor. These preclude the\nobservation of the 63 keV g-ray line. Assuming that the un-\nobserved 63 keV fast transition is of M1, E1, or E2 char-\nacter, the 3792 keV level is assigned Ip5(142), (141), or\n(152).\nOn the basis of the g-ray intensity balances, M1 multipo-\nlarities are assigned for both the 180 keV @aT\nexp51.360.2,\naT\ncal(M1)51.1] and 231 keV @aTexp50.4660.09, aTcal(M1)\n50.55] transitions. Combining these with the DCO ratio of\nthe 554 keV transition (RDCO51.1160.17), the 4756 keV\nisomer is assigned Ip5(182), (181), or (192). However,\nthe Ip5181 and 192 assignments can be excluded since in\nthese cases the 634 keV transition to the Ip5(162) state in\nband I are of M2 or M3 character, and the transition strength\nfor such higher multipoles is normally very weak. Conse-\nquently, we assigned Ip5(142), (152), (162), and (182)\nfor the 3792, 3971, 4202, and 4756 keV states, respectively.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. Rotational alignments\nThe magnitude of rotational alignments for multiquasipar-\nticle bands depend on the alignments of constituent quasipar-\nticles in the configuration, e.g., for bands which involve i13\/2\nneutrons and\/or h9\/2 protons, large rotational alignments are\nexpected due to the strong Coriolis interaction on these qua-\nsiparticles ~see, e.g., Ref. @19#!. It can, therefore, be used to\ndeduce quasiparticle configurations for rotational bands. In\nthe cranked shell model @20# rotational alignments can be\nobtained by subtracting the aligned angular momentum of\nthe reference configuration from the total aligned angular\nmomentum Ix@5AI(I11)2K2# . In Fig. 4, the rotational\nalignments for the negative parity bands observed in 184Os\nare shown as a function of the rotational frequencies \\v\ngiven in units of keV. The Harris parameters used are I0\n526 MeV21\\2 and I1565 MeV23\\4 taken from Ref. @14#.\nFIG. 4. Alignment plots for the negative parity bands observed\nin 184Os. Harris parameters of I0526 MeV21 \\2 and I1\n565 MeV23 \\4 are taken from Ref. @14#.06431In the calculation, we assume the K values fixed to the band-\nhead spins ~see also Sec. IV C!.\nThe Kp562, 81\n2\n, and 82\n2 bands show alignments of\nabout 2\\ consistent with the previous configuration assign-\nments @14#, including one aligned i13\/2 quasineutron. The\nalignment for band I is similar to those for the Kp581\n2 and\n82\n2 bands, indicating the presence of an i13\/2 quasineutron\ninvolved in the configuration. As discussed in Sec. IV C 2, a\nlarge alignment of ;5\\ for band II is due to the presence of\nthree highly aligned ni13\/2 and ph9\/2 quasiparticles in the\nconfiguration.\nB. gK factors\nIntensity ratios of E2 crossover to M1(1E2) cascade\ntransitions in a band can be used to deduce gK factors within\nthe rotational model @21#. Experimental ugK2gRu values\nwere obtained from the rotational expressions @19#. The val-\nues listed in Table II have been extracted with the assump-\ntion that K is equal to the band-head spin and the quadrupole\nmoment of Q055.67 e b taken from Ref. @2#.\nThe calculated gK factors @22# can be obtained in the\nsemiclassical model @23# by the equation\ngK\neff2gR5\n( j~gK j2gR!K j\nK 2\n( j~gK j2gR!i j\nAI22K2\n, ~1!\nwhere gK j is the gyromagnetic factor of the j th quasiparticle,\ni j the aligned angular momentum, K j the angular momentum\nprojection on the deformation axis, and K5( jK j . The first\nterm represents the usual expression of (gK2gR) in the\nstrong coupling limit, while the second term is due to the\nCoriolis effects which are important for configurations in-\nvolving i13\/2 neutrons and\/or h9\/2 protons in the present case.\nThe i j values were taken from the known one-quasiparticle\nbands of the neighboring odd-A nuclei. The gK j factors for\neach quasiparticle have been calculated from the equation of\ngK j5(^l3&gl1^s3&gs)\/K j , assuming 70% of the free\nnucleon gs factors @24# (gsfree55.59 for protons and 23.83\nfor neutrons!. Here, l3 (s3) is the projected component of the\norbital angular momentum ~intrinsic spin! on the nuclear\nsymmetry axis, and gl51 for protons, gl50 for neutrons.\nThe expectation values of s3 were obtained from Nilsson\nwave functions. Table III summarizes the gK j factors and the\nalignments i j used in the calculation.\nThe experimental and calculated (gK2gR) values are\ncompared in Table II. The deviations between the experimen-\ntal and calculated values for the Kp581\n2 and 82\n2 bands\nwere attributed @14# to the configuration mixing of the\ntwo Kp582 configurations, n$7\/22@503# 9\/21@624#% and\nn$7\/22@514# 9\/21@624#%.

The potentials\nare reflection symmetric about the g50\u00b0 axis.Walker et al. have analyzed decay rates of high-K isomers\nin terms of statistical K mixing which depends on the density\nof states @10#. States with lower-K values are assumed to be\nmixed and introduce low-K components into the isomeric\nstate. The systematics reveal a striking correlation between\nthe f n values and the excitation energies of K isomers (EK),\nrelative to the energy of a rigid rotor @ER5(\\2\/2I)I(I11)\nwith the moment of inertia I of a rigid rotor# in the\nK-forbidden transitions from four- to two-quasiparticle\nstates. In the density-of-states estimate the f n value can be\nobtained as\nf nstat5Fn expF2 3nA A7.5 ~EK2ER!G , ~2!\nwhere Fn is a constant for a given value of n and A is the\nmass number. The reduced hindrance factors decline depend-\ning on the relative excitation energies of the isomers. Using\nthe same prescription as in Ref. @10#, the hindrance factor for\nthe DK59 E2 ~634 keV! transition from the Kp5(182)\nisomer in 184Os, is calculated as f nstat54.6 with EK2ER\n54.75621.96852.788 MeV, which compares well with\nthe observed f n value of 3.7. This result follows the system-\natic trend obtained in Ref. @10#. Since the rotational align-\nment of band I is blocked due to the occupation of an i13\/2\nneutron orbital, the effects of K mixing in the populated\nstates would be small. On the other hand, it was suggested\nthat the lower value of f nexp52.3 observed for the 182Os,\nDK516 E2 ~1530 keV! transition with a similar EK2ER\nvalue of 2.794 MeV, results from the involvement of high-K ,\nFermi-aligned couplings in the populated states @10#.\nA number of four- and six-quasiparticle states have been\nobserved in 184Os. Among them, only the Kp5(182) isomer064310is relatively long lived (T1\/2548 ns). This is a consequence\nof the details of the level structure of this nucleus. In the I\n513\u2013 18 region, only the Kp5(132) and (182) intrinsic\nstates are observed, and thus the Kp5(182) isomer can only\ndecay by K-forbidden transitions with DK>5.\nE. Potential-energy-surface calculations\nConfiguration-constrained potential-energy-surface ~PES!\ncalculations were performed for the positive parity states in\n184Os @14#, where the nuclear potential was calculated using\nthe Lipkin-Nogami formalism of pairing with a Woods-\nSaxon potential as described by Xu et al. @28#. While the\nground state and the Kp5101 state have axially symmetric\nshapes (b2\u20190.19 and ugu\u20190\u00b0), the Kp5211 state is pre-\ndicted to have a triaxial deformation with b250.20 and ugu\n511\u00b0 @14#.\nIn the present study, the shape evolution for the negative\nparity states in 184Os has been investigated using the same\nconfiguration-constrained PES calculation code. As shown in\nFig. 5, the Kp5132 and 182 configurations, corresponding\nto the experimentally observed Ex53728 and 4756 keV\nstate, have axially symmetric shapes (b250.23 and 0.20\nwith ugu\u20190\u00b0). On the other hand, the PES calculations pre-\ndict that triaxially deformed states (Kp5222, 252, and\n302) become increasingly favored at higher spins, compet-\ning with prolate deformed states (Kp5232 and 262) as\nshown in Table VI. Deformations for the Kp5222 and 232\nconfigurations, which could correspond to the observed Ex\n56339 and 6797 keV states, are calculated to be ~b,ugu!\n5~0.19,10\u00b0! and ~0.21,0\u00b0!, respectively ~Fig. 5!.

The quasiparticle configurations for these states were\nassigned by comparison with multiquasiparticle calculations.\nThe Kp5(182) isomer decays with large K changes (K\n>5), resulting in the relatively long half-life. However, the\nlow hindrances ( f n) for the isomeric transitions are inter-\npreted as being due to K mixing from a combination of g\nsoftness and high level density. Configuration-constrained\nPES calculations for the negative parity states in 184Os show\nthat the triaxially deformed states (Kp5222, 252, and 302)\ncompete with the axially deformed states (Kp5232 and\n262) at high spins. The 6339 keV state has been tentatively\nassigned as the Kp5222 triaxially deformed state. Further\nexperimental investigation is required to reveal the role of\ntriaxiality in K conservation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank Dr. C.
