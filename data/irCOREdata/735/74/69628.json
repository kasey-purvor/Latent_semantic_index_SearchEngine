INTRODUCTION\n1.1 The cardiovascular system\nThe cardiovascular system (CVS) consists of the heart, lungs and blood vessels. Its function is to keep the blood\nin continuous circulation, carrying nutrients and oxygen to all parts of the body and removing metabolic waste\nproducts. Starting from the left heart, the blood passes through the aorta, arteries, and capillaries. It is in the\ncapillary bed that most of the exchange of nutrients takes place, including the take up of oxygen by the cells\nand the corresponding removal of carbon dioxide. The blood flows from the capillaries into venules, and then\npasses via the veins and vena cava to the right heart, whence it is pumped via the pulmonary artery to the lungs.\nAfter giving up carbon dioxide there and becoming re-oxygenated, the blood returns via the pulmonary vein to\nthe left heart, and the process repeats. In a resting human, the whole volume of blood (\u223c5 \u2113) flows through the\nheart within about one minute, on average.\nTo ensure effective function of the CVS, while keeping the blood pressure within appropriate limits, close\ncoordination between its components is clearly essential. Correspondingly, there are several control mechanisms\nthat are able to adjust the heart rate and stroke volume, and the impedance of the vascular system. The blood\nvessels that comprise the latter are very far from being inert tubes. Rather, they have muscular walls that exhibit\nvasomotion \u2013 continuous oscillatory movements that are used to regulate the flow.\nIn what follows we consider the CVS as a single entity made up of the relatively small number of subsystems\ndiscussed above. We will not be interested in the detail of how e.g. the heart functions, or in its internal structure.\nInstead, we consider it as a discrete subsystem, able to interact in complex ways with the other subsystems that\nconstitute the CVS. We will show that many features of the cardiovascular system can be accounted for if it is\ntreated as a stochastic dynamical system using techniques drawn from nonlinear science.\nWe emphasize that our review amounts to a status report on work in progress, and that there are many\ninteresting questions raised by the research that still remain to be answered. Although the approach that we will\ndescribe seems highly promising in relation to applications, these are still in their infancy as we discuss below.\nIt is our hope that this review will be useful to those who wish to develop the techniques in question, especially\nin relation to their many potential applications in the medical field.\nE-mails: p.v.e.mcclintock@lancaster.ac.uk and aneta@osc.fe.uni-lj.si\nPublished in Fluctuations and Noise in Biological, Biophysical and Biomedical Systems II, eds.

The positions of\nthe peaks are almost the same for all signals, while the corresponding amplitudes may be considerably different. After\nStefanovska and Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7.8\n1.2 Models of the cardiovascular system\nThere are many earlier models of the CVS.1\u20137 They mostly treat it as a complex control system, and do so\nin terms of averaged values of blood pressure, blood flow, and other relevant quantities. They interpret the\nobserved oscillations in the heart rate, blood pressure and blood flow in terms of nonlinearities and time delays,\nand concentrate mainly on short-term blood pressure control mechanisms, including respiratory oscillations and\noscillations with a period of around 10s. The picture that we develop below is complementary but different.\nAs we will see, there is much evidence favouring the perception of the CVS as a noisy dynamical system\nthat behaves in many respects like a collection of coupled oscillators. The phenomenological model that we will\ndescribe below in Sec. 5 takes explicit account of the dynamics of the CVS, and considers instantaneous values\nof the variables rather than their averages. It has the potential to capture the main dynamical features of the\nCVS and, it is hoped, to provide a description of the system in all its states, in sickness and in health.\nIn Sec. 2 we present and discuss briefly the experimental evidence for noisy oscillatory processes in the\nCVS. After considering their probable physiological origins in Sec. 3, we describe the interactions between the\noscillators in Sec. 4. We discuss the progress made to date on modelling the CVS as a set of coupled oscillators\nin Sec. 5 and some applications of this approach to the CVS in Sec. 6. Finally, we draw the threads together\nand present our conclusions in Sec. 7.\n2. EVIDENCE FOR OSCILLATORS\n2.1 Cardiovascular signals\nIn order to study, not just the rhythmical activity of the heart in isolation, but the CVS as a whole, it is desirable\nto make several different kinds of measurement simultaneously.8 Fig. 1(a) shows a short sample from a set of\nsuch results where ECG, blood pressure, and blood flow rate were recorded simultaneously, for a healthy subject\nin repose, over a period of 20 minutes in total. The heart rate variability (HRV) is derived from the ECG signal.\n2.2 Spectral content \u2013 use of the wavelet transform\nOur interest centres primarily on the bloodflow circulatory control mechanisms, so processes occurring on\ntimescales longer than about 1 minute (the average circulation period) will be ignored. Fig. 1(b) shows the\naveraged wavelet transform of the same data as Fig. 1(a), but calculated over the full 20 minutes. A detailed\ndiscussion of such results has been presented by Stefanovska and Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7.8 It is immediately evident that \u2013\n\u2022 There are (at least) five characteristic spectral peaks.\n\u2022 Remarkably, the same, or almost the same, peaks appear in all the spectra, regardless of where or how the\ncorresponding signals were recorded, though there are considerable differences in amplitude.\n\u2022 All the peaks are broadened.\nAlthough the oscillatory processes implied by the spectral peaks suggest deterministic activity at those frequencies\n(Table 1), the widths of the peaks cannot be accounted for just in terms of the width introduced by the wavelet\nanalysis. A clue to the origin of some of this broadening can be found by inspection of the full time-frequency\nwavelet spectrum, part of which is shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that both the instantaneous amplitudes and\ncentral frequencies vary in time.\nIt appears that the instantaneous frequency of any given spectral peak oscillates. The modulation results\nmainly from interaction with the process giving rise to the spectral peak next-lowest in frequency, with contri-\nbutions coming from all of the other oscillatory processes too. Heart rate variability (HRV), for example, is a\nsignal representing the variations of the cardiac frequency, and from Fig. 1(b) we can see (third spectrum from\nthe top) that its oscillations are also modulated by the processes with frequencies near 0.011, 0.026, 0.1, and\n0.18 Hz (as well as its own second harmonic at 0.36 Hz). Such observations can be construed as evidence that\nthe five oscillatory processes are mutually coupled. At least some of the couplings are parametric, thus giving\nrise to the observed frequency modulation.\nThe electrical activity that initiates the contraction of the heart originates at the sino-atrial node, and this\nperiodicity has consequently been called the sinus rhythm. In adapting continuously to the needs of the body,\nthe heart alters its rate and this alteration is known as sinus arrhythmia. HRV is extensively studied because of\nits potential for providing noninvasive measures of cardiovascular control mechanisms.10 However, neither the\nphysiological mechanisms of interaction, nor their dynamical properties, are fully understood.\n540\n550\n560\n570\n3\n1\n0.3\n0.1\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nTime (s)Frequency (Hz)\nW\nav\nel\net\n tr\nan\nsf\nor\nm\n (A\nU)\n540 545 550 555 560 565 570\n100\n150\n200\n250\nAm\npl\nitu\nde\n (A\nU)\n540 545 550 555 560 565 570\n1\n1.05\n1.1\n1.15\nFr\neq\nue\nnc\ny \n(H\nz)\nTime (s)\nFigure 2.

On the right are plotted the amplitude and frequency variations\nof the heartrate peak. After Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 et al.9\n3. PHYSIOLOGICAL ORIGINS OF THE OSCILLATIONS\nIt may be inferred that the five spectral peaks probably arise from five underlying oscillatory processes of\nsome kind. Their current physiological attributions are shown in Table 1. We consider below the reasons for\nTable 1. Characteristic frequencies and their probable physiological origins.\n\u223cFrequency(Hz) Physiological process\n1.0 Heart\n0.2 Respiration\n0.1 Intrinsic myogenic activity\n0.03 Neurogenic, resulting from sympathetic nerve activity\n0.01 Endothelial-related metabolic activity\nthese attributions, taking in turn the different spectral ranges. Before doing so, we enter three caveats. First,\ninformation about the slower three processes is obtained at one remove: they cannot be measured directly but,\nrather, they show up in measurements of other signals, e.g. of the ECG or blood flow. They apparently relate to\nmechanisms that control vasoconstriction or vasodilation (i.e. adjustments to the radii of the blood vessels), and\nthus are distributed throughout the whole body. Secondly, it is always possible that two or more physiological\nprocesses may be involved in maintaining a basic oscillatory activity expressed within one frequency interval, or\nat separate frequencies that are too close to be resolved. Thirdly, because of mutual coupling, the effect of one\nphysiological process may manifest in several frequency intervals. Thus there must, in principle, inevitably be a\nmeasure of ambiguity in any attributions that are made.\n3.1 The 1 Hz and 0.2 Hz oscillators\nThe origins of the two higher frequencies are in a sense obvious: they relate to the cardiac and respiratory\nprocesses, oscillations that can be measured directly. It is worth commenting, however, that certainty about the\norigin of the \u223c0.2 Hz oscillations that appear in blood pressure and blood flow signals was achieved through\nsimultaneous measurements of all these quantities,8 facilitating direct comparison of the respiratory oscillations\nwith the apparently comparable spectral peaks in the other signals.\n3.2 The 0.1 Hz oscillator\nThe existence of oscillations of period \u223c10 s in blood pressure and HRV signals was originally attributed to blood\npressure regulatory mechanisms.1, 11 Reaching an understanding of the physiological origin of these oscillations\nis characterised, however, by two particular difficulties.\nFirst, the \u223c0.1Hz oscillations are observed in three different contexts: as a modulation of the heart rate in\nthe HRV signal; as waves in the blood pressure signal, long known as Mayer waves;12 and as one of the oscillatory\ncomponents in blood flow through small vessels, measured by the laser Doppler technique. Conventionally, these\nthree signals are studied separately, in the course of research in different areas of medicine such as cardiology,\nhypertension, or angiology, and are interpreted differently. Research on heart rate variability usually concentrates\non a possible baroreceptor origin of the 0.1 Hz oscillatory component. Baroreceptors are biological sensors,\nsituated in large arteries, that sense changes in pressure. Thus the 0.1 Hz oscillation is often believed to\noriginate as a reflex-induced response: the interval between heartbeats increases as the arterial blood pressure\nrises. However, respiration also induces blood pressure fluctuations via an influence that is mainly mechanical.\nSo it remains unclear whether baroreceptor involvement should be manifested at \u223c0.1 Hz or at \u223c0.25 Hz (see\nFrederiks et al? and references therein) or, as we shall see shortly, at \u223c0.03 Hz. On the other hand, most studies\nof the \u223c0.1Hz oscillation, based on measurement of blood flow in small vessels, point to their local origin: they\nare shown to result from the intrinsic myogenic activity of smooth muscle in the walls of blood vessels, leading to\nvasomotion,13\u201315 a process that occurs even for isolated vessels in vitro. If HRV, blood pressure and blood flow\nsignals and their spectra are displayed simultaneously, as presented in Fig. 1, we see that the 0.1 Hz oscillation\ncan be observed in all spectra. The small differences result from their local origin.\nSecondly, there is still a measure of confusion stemming from the limited frequency resolution of some of\nthe pioneering experiments. Given the huge dynamic range of the characteristic frequencies of interest (Fig.\n1(b)), and the fact that the frequencies also vary in time (Fig. 2), use of a conventional Fourier transform cannot\nseparate the three lower frequencies. Consequently, all the low frequency oscillations tended to be lumped\ntogether and described as 0.1 Hz oscillations. In the literature, therefore, several physiological mechanisms that\nin reality probably manifest in lower frequency intervals, seem to compete with each other as the probable origin\nof the 0.1 Hz oscillation. Use of the recently introduced time-frequency methods with logarithmic frequency\nresolution8 have brought clarity and order, however, and the new understanding is gradually replacing the\nconventional picture based mainly on the Fourier transform.\n3.3 The 0.03 Hz oscillator\nThis oscillation appears to derive from neurogenic (sympathetic nervous activity, or SNA) control of the radii of\nthe vessels.16 The best evidence comes from experiments on denervated skin flaps: it was found that, when the\nnerves were disconnected, the \u223c0.03 Hz spectral peak disappeared.17 New experimental approaches are revealing\na possible role for arterial baroreceptors in the chronic regulation of SNA.18\n3.4 The 0.01 Hz oscillator\nThere is convincing evidence15, 19, 20 that the \u223c0.01 Hz oscillation is associated with the endothelium, the thin\nlayer of cells that lines the inner surfaces of the blood vessels. The argument derives from laser-Doppler blood\nflow measurements made while diffusing different vasodilating drugs through the skin by iontophoresis. The\nrelative power in the \u223c0.01 Hz spectral peak is substantially increased when acetylcholine (ACh, an endothelium-\ndependent vasodilator) is administered in this way, but it is not selectively affected when the vasodilator sodium\nnitroprusside (SNP, a direct NO donor) is used.\n4. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE OSCILLATORS\n4.1 Modulation\nInteractions among the oscillatory processes are marked by both amplitude modulation and, in particular, fre-\nquency modulation. The clearest evidence for frequency modulation can be obtained for the cardiac frequency.\nThe HRV signal is effectively the instantaneous frequency of the heart beat and its spectrum (Fig. 1(b)) contains\nfour characteristic frequencies, i.e. all the other four frequencies discussed above. The observed variations in the\nrate and the amplitude of the heart beat (as shown in Fig. 2) can thus be attributed to a continuous interaction\nbetween the oscillatory processes involved in blood distribution.8\nThe existence of an interaction between the cardiac and respiratory functions has been known since the 18th\ncentury when Hales carried out his celebrated experiments21 on a horse. He found that the heart rate increased\non inspiration and decreased on expiration. This frequency modulation phenomenon, known as respiratory sinus\narrhythmia, has been studied extensively, e.g.22\u201324 since then. It has also been recognized that the respiratory\nfunction can modify the amplitude of cardiac oscillations (stroke volume).25 Traube in 1865 and Hering in 1869\nindependently observed waves in systemic blood pressure associated12 with respiration. Their presence in both\nblood pressure and flow signals20 illustrates the propagation of the oscillations through the CVS.26\nAlthough recordings can now be made noninvasively, they are in practice of insufficient duration \u2013 i.e. they\ndo not include a large enough number of cycles \u2013 for good characterisation of the interactions between the lower\nfrequency oscillations.\n4.2 Cardio-respiratory synchronization\nBecause the respiratory process and the heart beat may be regarded as oscillators, we may expect their mutual\ninteraction to result in an adjustment of their rhythms, sometimes leading to synchronization. Their instan-\ntaneous frequencies can easily be measured, enabling their mutual interaction to be analysed. Early studies\n(see Raschke et al27 and references therein) considered temporal coordination between cardiac and respiratory\nrates: joint interval histograms were plotted and integer ratios of frequency and distinct phase preference were\nanalysed. An n:1 synchronization of the rhythms was found in an\u00e6sthetized rabbits, and in humans in various\nsleep stages, at rest, during physical work,27\u201329 and in an\u00e6sthesia.?, 30 It was also concluded31 that the rhythms\nare generally not phase-locked, implying either that the cardiorespiratory coupling is relatively weak, or that the\ndisruptive effects of random fluctuations (noise) are relatively strong.\nThe introduction of nonlinear methods, and the concepts of generalised and phase synchronization, further\nilluminated the problem and confirmed that cardiorespiratory synchronization usually occurs as brief episodes.33\nUse of the synchrogram and synchronization index facilitated the detection of synchronization even where both\nfrequencies were time-varying. It was found that the synchronization episodes in healthy subjects at rest (e.g.\nFig. 3, left) were \u223c10 times longer (\u223c1000 s) in athletes33 than in non-athletes32 and, furthermore, that their\nlength depended inversely on the average depth of the frequency modulation of the heart rate. From the latter\nresult it may reasonably be inferred that the inter-oscillator coupling strength, as revealed by the lengths of the\nsynchronization episodes, constitutes a useful piece of information about the state of the organism. This idea is\napparently confirmed by measurements on a critically ill patient in coma. As shown in the right-hand panels of\nFig. 3, there is absolutely no sign of synchronization: the synchrogram indicates continuous phase-slippage, even\nthough the ratio of the cardiac and respiratory frequencies remains almost constant.\n4.3 Synchronization phenomena in ana\u00e6sthesia\nA physiological state where synchronization phenomena are of particular interest and importance is that of\nana\u00e6sthesia.34 The synchronization state in a rat is then typically as shown in the measurements of Fig. 4 (left).\n(a)\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nTime (s)\n\u03a8\n1\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n6\n8\n10\nTime (s)\nf h\/\nf r\n\u03a8\n1\nf h\/\nf r\n\u03a8\n1\nf h\/\nf r\n\u03a8\n1\nf h\/\nf r\n(b)\n0 100 200 300 400 500 6000\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nTime (s)\n\u03a8\n1\n0 100 200 300 400 500 6002\n4\n6\n8\nTime (s)\nf h\/\nf r\n\u03a8\n1\nf h\/\nf r\n\u03a8\n1\nf h\/\nf r\nFigure 3.

Between 510 s and 580 s seven horizontal lines are observed, indicating a 7:1 synchronization between the\ncardiac and respiratory oscillations. During this time, the generalised phase difference |n\u03a6h \u2212m\u03a6r|, where \u03a6h and \u03a6r\nare the phases of heart and respiratory activities, remains constant and so also does the instantaneous frequency ratio.\n(b) The same quantities for a patient in coma. The patient was heavily sedated and ventilated via a respirator at a\nconstant frequency of fr = 0.33 Hz. His cardiac frequency is high and constant (fh = 1.6 Hz), resulting in a constant\nfrequency ratio, fh\/fr . However, the normalised relative phase of the heartbeat within a respiratory cycle is not constant\nat any time of the recording. In this critical state the systems seem to be no longer capable of responding to external\nperturbations, including their mutual influences, so that their phases change without any relationship one to the other.\nAfter Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 Lotric\u02c7 et al.32\nData recording can be initiated as soon as the an\u00e6sthetic has taken effect, at time = 0 on the left hand side.\nInitially there is 1:2 synchronization, as shown by the synchrogram and by the relevant synchronization index\n\u03bb1,2 being close to unity. As time evolves, the ana\u00e6sthesia deepens, and the system passes through a hierarchy\nof different synchronization states. During deepest ana\u00e6sthesia (20\u201340 minutes), the system remains locked into\n1:5 synchronization. This process is usually reversible,34 passing back through the same set of synchronization\nstates as the an\u00e6sthetic wears off.\n0\n0.5\n1\n\u03bb 1\n,2\n0\n0.5\n1\n\u03bb 1\n,3\n0 10 20 30 40\n0\n0.5\n1\n\u03bb 1\n,5\nTime  (min)\n0\n0.5\n1\n\u03bb 1\n,4\n2pi\n\u03a8\n1\npi\n0\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n0\n5\n10\nf h\/\nf r\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1\nd r\n,h\nTime  (min)\nFigure 4.

When dr,h > 0, the direction of the interaction is such that respiration\ndrives the heart; when dr,h < 0, the heart is driving the respiratory process, as evidently occurs at the end of deep\nan\u00e6sthesia.\nAn additional very interesting effect occurs in the cardiorespiratory interaction of rats during an\u00e6sthesia,\nas revealed by changes in the directionality index.35\u201338 This quantity relates to the causal relationships in the\ninteraction, i.e. it enables us to distinguish between the driving and driven oscillators. The directionality index\nof the cardiorespiratory coupling dr,h, calculated from the data, is plotted in Fig. 4 (right). As the an\u00e6sthetic\ntakes effect, dr,h quickly rises towards unity, and remains there until consciousness starts to return again. Thus,\nnotwithstanding the changes in the cardiac\/respiratory frequency ratio fh\/fr (top), and the sequence of synchro-\nnization states being traversed, we may conclude that during deep an\u00e6sthesia respiration drives the heart, as also\noccurs during the waking state but that, in the shallower an\u00e6sthesia that starts after \u223c70 minutes, respiration\nis driven by the heart. This observation is not yet understood but if the same phenomenon occurs in humans, as\nseems likely, then there is obvious potential in using the directionality index as a noninvasive measure of depth\nof an\u00e6sthesia. Full details will be published elsewhere.\n4.4 Synchronization involving the lower frequency oscillators\nGiven the interesting information flowing from studies of cardiorespiratory synchronization, it is natural to\nconsider the possibility of similar phenomena between other pairs of the five oscillators. This is a challenging\nquestion, for several reasons. One is the practical upper limit of \u223c30 minutes on the length of time series\nthat can be recorded under stationary conditions, i.e. such that the subject remains sufficiently relaxed for the\ncardiovascular system not to undergo large transients corresponding to movement artifacts during recording. For\nthe lowest frequency oscillator (\u223c0.01 Hz) this interval includes too few complete periods to obtain good statistics\nin measuring a spectral density, or even to answer unambiguously whether or not synchronization exists.\nThere is also another quite separate problem. For the heart and respiration, separate signals are available,\nand these can be compared and tested for synchronization of their oscillations using the standard methods\nmentioned above for treating bivariate data. There is no noninvasive method for acquiring a separate signal\nfrom any of the other three oscillators, however, so that it is necessary to seek synchronization information in\nunivariate data (a single signal). Methods proposed for doing so include: (i) decomposition into principle modes\nor bandpass filtration of the univariate data to synthesize two, or more \u201csignals\u201d26, 39 that can then be analyzed\nusing standard methods;40 (ii) the use of angles maps;41 and (iii) bispectral analysis.42 All these approaches\nseem to indicate that the myogenic (\u223c0.1 Hz) oscillations can sometimes become synchronized with respiration.\nAlthough no observation of synchronization involving the neurogenic or endothelial oscillations has been\nreported, we comment that these oscillations must be of a kind that are capable of becoming synchronized.\nThe very fact that they can be observed8 in centrally measured quantities such as the heart rate variability\nsignal (derived from the ECG, or the blood pressure) implies that there must be episodes, at least, of global\nsynchronization between many of the spatially distributed oscillators of a particular frequency. Otherwise, if\ntheir phases were totally incoherent, the oscillations would average out and no spectral peak would be detected.\n4.5 Bispectral analysis\nA recent extension of bispectral analysis to encompass time dependence42 offers a very promising technique for\nobtaining information about the inter-oscillator interactions. It has been demonstrated by application to an\ninteracting system of Poincare\u00b4 oscillators (see Sec. 5) in the presence of noise, under a wide variety of conditions.\nIt enables: (i) the whole frequency domain to be observed\/analysed simultaneously; (ii) detection that two or\nmore subsystems are interacting with each other; (iii) quantification of the strength of the interaction; and (iv)\ndetermination of whether the coupling is additive linear or quadratic, or parametric in one of the frequencies. Ap-\nplied to the CVS, the technique has apparently demonstrated? that the cardiorespiratory interaction is nonlinear\nin character.\n5. COUPLED OSCILLATOR MODEL\nWe now discuss in more detail the phenomenological approach to modelling the CVS introduced by Stefanovska.43\nIt is based on the assumption that a physiological entity that can be viewed as a \u201csystem\u201d requires a balance\nbetween energy inflow and energy expenditure. Constant changes occur in the balance condition, resulting\nin oscillations. The balance may be between excitation and inhibition, as in excitable systems such as cardiac\nmuscle, or between diffusion and reaction as is probably the case for the endothelial-based metabolic oscillations at\n0.01 Hz. She suggested that five oscillators of different frequencies, chosen to match the characteristic frequencies\nobserved in the experiments, should be used, and the idea was elaborated in subsequent publications.8, 8, 44, 44, 45\nThe basic unit in the model, corresponding to the autonomous part of an oscillator, is the Poincare\u00b4 oscillator\nx\u02d9i = \u2212xiqi \u2212 \u03c9iyi + gxi(x),\ny\u02d9i = \u2212yiqi + \u03c9ixi + gyi(y), qi = \u03b1i(\n\u221a\nx2i + y\n2\ni \u2212 ai),\n(1)\nwhere x, y are vectors of oscillator state variables, \u03b1i, ai, and \u03c9i are constants and gyi(y) and gxi(x) are linear\ncoupling vectors. Although to some extent this choice is arbitrary, (1) possesses the properties of structural\nstability, robustness and symmetry that are consistent with physiological understanding, and with the analyses\nof measured time series; it also has the advantage that the interpretation of amplitude and phase is particularly\nsimple and direct.\nThe activity of each subsystem is described by two state variables, the blood flow xi, and the velocity of\nflow yi, where i = 1 is generated by the heart, i = 2 by respiration, i = 3 by the myogenic oscillator, i = 4 by\nthe neurogenic oscillator, and i = 5 by the endothelial related metabolic oscillator. The mutual impact of the\nsubsystems is taken into account as coupling terms. Additional effects resulting from the spatial distribution of\nsome of the systems (the myogenic, neurogenic and endothelial related metabolic activities), the effect of their\npropagation delays, and the influence of additional subsystems acting on longer time scales than those considered,\nare all taken into account as random noise.\nA very important, but difficult, part of the model synthesis lies in the treatment of the couplings between\nthe oscillators. Because the types of coupling are in most cases currently unknown, linear couplings are used,\nconsistent with the facts that the same basic frequency components appear in all the CVS signals and that the\ncombinatorial components appearing in them are very small. Time delays are very important in the description\nand modelling of the CVS.1\u20135, 7, 11, 46, 47 In our approach, however, we perceive the blood distribution system\nas one in which continuous information about every subsystem, acting with essentially different frequencies,\nis provided and fed back via the coupling terms. There are thus inherent delays corresponding to the time\nscales on which particular subsystems act. In some cases the sign of the coupling term can be determined from\nexisting physiological knowledge or experimental observation. Direct modulation of the heart frequency by the\nrespiration, and clear evidence of the corresponding combinational frequencies in the Fourier spectra for the\nsubject in coma, suggest unidirectional parametric coupling, i.e. cardiac frequency modified by respiration but\nnot vice versa. Experimental evidence also suggests that most of the couplings are asymmetrical.\nThe function of the heart can be represented as\nx\u02d91 = \u2212x1q1 \u2212 y1\u03c91 + \u03b72x2 \u2212 \u03b73x3 \u2212 \u03b74x4 + \u03b75x5 \u2212 \u03b76(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62)\ny\u02d91 = \u2212y1q1 + x1\u03c91 + \u03b72y2 \u2212 \u03b73y3 \u2212 \u03b74y4 + \u03b75y5 , (2)\nwhere \u03b7i are coupling terms. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia refers to frequency modulation of the heart rate: the\nheart beats faster during inspiration and slower during expiration. Negative influences of the myogenic (\u2212\u03b73) and\nneurogenic system on the heart (\u2212\u03b74) are considered. The autonomous nervous system processes the information\nsensed by receptors and continuously adjusts the heart rate. The heart is innervated by both divisions of the\nautonomous nervous system \u2013 the sympathetic increases, and the parasympathetic decreases, the frequency and\namplitude of myocardial contractions. Parasympathetic tone predominates in healthy resting humans. Increased\nmetabolic activity results in an increased heart rate: a positive control loop is therefore assigned to the metabolic\nsystem (\u03b75). The difference between the inflow (\u03a61) on the arterial side and the outflow (\u03a62) to the venous side\nalso contributes to the flow of blood generated by the heart.\nThe dynamics of each of the other oscillators and their couplings at any point of the cardiovascular system\ncan be described in a similar way. However, the cardiac contribution to the flow at each point results not only\nfrom the influences of local regulatory mechanisms, but also from the integration of the pressure (P ) and flow\n(\u03a6) values along the entire system. A global effect of the pressure on the myogenic and the neurogenic activity,\nand of the flow on metabolic activity, is also to be expected. Stefanovska et al44, 45 therefore extended the model\nto describe the activity of the oscillators that regulate the flow of blood along the cardiovascular system.\n5.1 Digital modelling of the CVS\nThe model equations were simulated digitally, yielding promising results48 that clearly demonstrated, however,\nthe difficulties of optimizing parameter selection within such a large parameter space. Rather than modelling\nthe full set of equations, we consider as an example the simplified case where we add a fluctuational term \u03be(t)\nto the cardiac oscillations (2)\nx\u02d91 = \u2212x1q1 \u2212 2\u03c0f1y1 + gx1(x) + \u03be(t),\n\u3008\u03be(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008\u03be(t)\u03be(0)\u3009 = D\u03b4(t),\n(3)\nto take account of all influences coming from the rest of the system. The addition of the random term, very\ninterestingly, resulted in occasional episodes of synchronization in the cardio-respiratory synchrogram as shown\nin Fig. 5, quite similar to what has been seen experimentally (cf. Fig. 3(a)). Without noise, only the standard\nregimes of phase-locking, phase modulation, and their interplay, could be observed. However, the modelled heart\nrate variability remained very small suggesting that parametric coupling probably plays an important role in\nthe cardiac activity and in the activity of other cardiovascular oscillators. So the system was also modelled\nusing a parametric coupling between the cardiac and respiratory oscillators. The result was regular, almost\n0 50 100 150 200\n\u22121\n0\n1\nx1\ntime, s\n(a)\n0 50 100 150 200\n\u22122\n0\n2\nx2\ntime, s\n(b)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\n10\u22125\n100\nS(f)\nf, Hz\n(d)\n0 50 100 150 200\n0\n2\n4\n6\nph\nas\ne \nm\nod\n 2\npi\ntime, s\n(c)\nFigure 5.

It seems that linear couplings with noise produce a more realistic synchronisation result, but\nthat parametric coupling is necessary to provide the depth of modulation observed in the spectra (see Fig. 2).\nProbably, therefore, both forms of coupling are present in reality.\n5.2 Bayesian inference\nSearching the model parameter space manually, making visual comparisons between the model data and the\nmeasurements, is time consuming and imprecise. A more systematic and objective optimisation procedure is\nrequired. One possible approach currently being explored relies on an application of Bayesian inference. The\nprinciples of this approach have already been reported49, 50 in detail but, in outline, the basis of the method can\nbe understood as follows. Consider a simple fluctuating system\nx\u02d9 = K(x|c) + \u03be(t), (4)\nK(x|c) =\nM\u2211\nk=1\nckfk(x) (5)\n\u3008\u03be(t)\u3009 = 0 (6)\n\u3008\u03be(t)\u03be(0)\u3009 = D\u03b4(t) (7)\nwhereK(x|c) is a deterministic drift force, the fk(x) are known base functions with unknown coefficients c = {ck},\nand \u03be(t) is zero-mean white noise of intensity D. A time series obtained from it might look e.g. as shown in\nFig. 6. We note immediately, first, that the time series contains a huge amount of information about the system\nthat generated it. This example is evidently bistable; if it is a potential system, details of the shapes, depth,\nand coordinate separation of the two wells are contained in the fluctuations about them; details of the potential\nmaximum separating the wells are inherent in the trajectories of the large occasional fluctuations that move\nthe system between the wells. Secondly, this information is revealed by the noise. In the absence of noise, no\ninformation would emerge and no conclusions could be drawn.\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500-2\n0\n2\nx\n(t)\nt\nFigure 6. Example of time series from a fluctuating nonlinear system, suitable for the identification by the fast Bayesian\ninference technique.\nThe fast Bayesian inference technique49, 50 proposed by Vadim Smelyanskiy formalises the approach and yields\nexplicit values of the unknown coefficients and noise intensity. We assume that measurement error is negligible\ncompared to the intrinsic dynamical noise \u03be(t), and we treat the state variable x as directly observable. The\nconditional probability density function (PDF) L(x|c) of an observation x(t) for a given choice of the model\nparameters c can51\u201353 then be written as\nL(x|c) = Pst(x(t0)|c)Fc [x(t)] . (8)\nHere Pst(x|c) is a stationary PDF of the system (4) and Fc[x(t)] is a probability density functional of x(t). It\ncan be expressed through the white noise path integral using the direct interrelation between the noise variable\n\u03be(t) and x(t) given by (4). From a prior probability density function (PDF) p(c) we compute a posterior PDF\np(c|x) using Bayes\u2019 theorem,\np(c|x) =\nL(x|c)p(c)\u222b\nL(x|c)p(c)dc\n, (9)\nwhere L(x|c) is the likelihood of observing x for the given parameters. The integral in the denominator in\n(9) ensures that the posterior PDF is normalized. Equation (9) is applied iteratively each time a new record\nof measurements is used: the prior distribution in the next iteration is just the posterior distribution from the\nprevious iteration. For a sufficiently large numberN of observations in x the posterior distribution p(c|x) becomes\nsharply peaked about certain parameter values c corresponding to the most probable model of the system for a\ngiven measurement set.\nThis approach has been tested and found to work well49, 50, 54 for a wide variety of simple systems where the\nanswers are all known in advance, e.g. Duffing and Van der Pol oscillators, and a simple system with delay. In\neach case, rapid convergence occurred to the correct coefficients. A full application to the cardiovascular system\nhas yet to be achieved, but the principle has already been demonstrated in relation to the respiratory system,\nmodelled as a Poincare\u00b4 oscillator.49, 54 The main difficulty still to be overcome is the limited understanding of\nhow the different physiological mechanisms interact with each other.\n6. POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS\nIn the long term, it is hoped to develop a model that is capable of encompassing all states of the cardiovascular\nsystem, in health and disease, by suitable choice of parameters. The relatively simple, non-invasive, measurements\ndescribed in Sec. 2.1, followed by automated analysis with a PC, could then be used for early diagnosis of a\nrange of cardiovascular diseases and for evaluation of the effects of treatment. Already, even in the absence of a\nuniversal model, significant progress is being made in characterising a number of common states and disorders,\nsome of which we now consider.\n6.1 Ageing\nThe dynamical characteristics of the CVS change steadily with age (see Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 Lotric\u02c7 et al32 and references\ntherein). The total spectral power of HRV signals, calculated from the wavelet transform in the interval from\n0.0095 Hz to 0.6 Hz, declines with age.32 A significant correlation was found between the age and the logarithm\nof the total power of the HRV. In addition, this decline is significant in each of the three low frequency intervals\n(around 0.01 Hz, 0.03 Hz and 0.1 Hz). In terms of normalized power, a greater decrease of power in higher\nfrequency intervals, around 0.1 Hz and 0.2 Hz, was reported than in the interval around 0.03 Hz and 0.01 Hz,\nimplicating that the age impacts differently on the different mechanisms of cardiovascular control.\n6.2 An\u00e6sthesia\nThe marked changes in the inter-oscillator interactions of an\u00e6sthetised rats (see Sec. 4) suggest that, if similar\nphenomena occur in humans, there may be a possible basis for measuring depth of an\u00e6sthesia. Such instrumen-\ntation is much to be desired, given that there is currently no really satisfactory, universally accepted, method\nand that a statistically significant proportion of patients can subsequently recall some degree of awareness during\nsurgery. Exploratory investigations of an\u00e6sthetised humans are currently in progress. The work is still at a very\nearly stage, but it is already clear that cardio-respiratory synchronisation is virtually continuous in naturally\nbreathing patients. It remains to be seen whether changes in the directionality indices are comparable with\nthose in rats. It is also unknown whether similar changes occur in mechanically-ventilated, curarised, patients \u2013\nthough there is no obvious reason why they should not.\n6.3 Cardiovascular diseases\n6.3.1 Diabetes\nIn diabetes, the total power of the HRV is decreased by a factor > 8 compared to healthy subjects. The\nspectral power in each frequency interval is also significantly reduced.32 Both the vascular and cardiac regulatory\nmechanisms are modified in diabetes. The vascular changes, named angiopathy, seem to occur first, resulting in a\nreduced supply of blood that subsequently affects the nerve endings situated in a vessel\u2019s walls. A possible scenario\nis that the neural control of the vessels is then lost, resulting in increased radii, with correspondingly decreased\nimpedance and increased blood flow. This process is named peripheral neuropathy. The cardiac nerves and\nsmall vessels undergo similar changes as well, a process that is called central autonomous neuropathy (central, to\ndistinguish it from the changes that occur in peripheral vessels). At this stage the cardio-respiratory interactions\nalso change. Recent studies are directed at establishing the timing of changes in cardiovascular regulation\nassociated with diabetes. As the autonomous function is not symmetrical, these changes occur unevenly: the\nlegs are affected first, followed by the dominant hand, while the non-dominant hand becomes affected at a later\nstage. We hope that the changes associated with each stage may provide a clear sequence of events to monitor,\nenabling us to anticipate and prevent complications such as foot ulceration or gangrene.\n6.3.2 Post-acute-myocardial-infarction\nThe residual isch\u00e6mia following acute myocardial infarction was shown to reduce heart rate variability. The\ngeometries of the beating heart and of its contraction are modified and the activity of the autonomous afferent\nfibres may be changed due to mechanical distortion of their sensory endings, altering cardiovascular regulation.\nWavelet analysis of the post-infarction HRV revealed lower total power compared to healthy subjects, but a\nlesser reduction than in diabetics (about fourfold).32 The absolute power was decreased in three of the frequency\nintervals, around 0.01 Hz, 0.03 Hz and 0.1 Hz. The most significant reduction in normalised power occurred in\nthe interval around 0.1 Hz, indicating that the mechanism responsible for this oscillatory component may be a\nmajor source of the decreased HRV.\n6.3.3 Cardiac failure\nBlood flow time series from cardiac failure patients are being measured on first diagnosis, prior to treatment,\nusing iontophoretically delivered vasodilators, as described above in Sec. 2.1, to evaluate endothelial reactivity.\nAnalysis by wavelet transform to quantify the energy in the spectral range near 0.01 Hz reveals that they have\nsignificantly impaired endothelial function. When the measurements\/analyses are repeated a few months later,\nafter treatment with beta-blockers has been initiated and the patients stabilised on the maximum tolerated dose,\nit is found that their endothelial response has changed in the direction of normality, i.e. towards the response\nlevel seen in age and gender-matched healthy subjects.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nCardiovascular time series are extremely complex but, given the extensive information they must contain about\nthe physiological state of the individual under study, they may be expected to repay careful analysis. The ap-\nproach that we have reviewed above, treating the CVS as a stochastic dynamical system and applying techniques\nfrom nonlinear science, is yielding very promising results. It is revealing physiological information, e.g. on the\ncouplings and direction of information flow between the oscillators, that are probably new to the physiologists\nand there appear to be several possible applications in medicine that merit further exploration and evaluation.\nAcknowledgements\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge valuable discussions with Andriy Bandrivskyy, Alan Bernjak, Maja Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7,\nPeter Clarkson, Janez Jams\u02c7ek, Yoshiki Kuramoto, Hebe Kvernmo, Dmitri Luchinsky, Bojan Musizza, Milan\nPalus\u02c7, Janko Petrovc\u02c7ic\u02c7, Yuri Shiogai, Andrew Smith, Dus\u02c7an S\u02c7tajer and Vilma Urbanc\u02c7ic\u02c7-Rovan.
