Introduction \nRecent demands for advanced nano- and micro-engineering have been the driving force in researching, \ndeveloping  and promoting the use of a number of processing technologies that have the potential for \nproducing the required technical specifications and quality at an acceptable cost. In particular, there is \na major interest and demand for the fabrication of various precision engineering parts and micro-tools, \nand for the production of fine small scale structures. The key issues relate to the ability to realise \nprocesses that can offer high resolution, high yield and low cost fabrication routes. These technologies \nare required in a wide range of applications, from the manufacturing of miniaturised components for \nvarious heterogeneous systems, to micro-fluidics, bio-medical, MEMS, and embedded test devices. \nThe development of nano- and micro-engineering structures, parts and components imposes a \nnumber of unique challenges [1]. Most commonly the challenges are associated with the need to use \ncompletely new, or little known manufacturing processes that may have significant uncertainty in \nterms of dimensional resolution and accuracy. The material behaviour at the micro-scale could also be \nvery different to the behaviour observed in the macro-scale world. Finally, the design performance and \n  \n \n \n \n \nquality could be very uncertain as a result of the miniaturised extremely small scale nature of these \nproducts. Nowadays, the use of computational modelling and software plays an important role in \nstudying, generating new knowledge and understanding the physical behaviour, expected quality and \nthe risk of defects in these products, or in identifying the optimal manufacturing process control. \nThe computational modelling and process optimisation of two particular nano- and micro-\nfabrication processes, focused ion beam (FIB) and nano-imprint forming (NIF), are presented and \ndiscussed. The computational analyses focus mainly on issues related to either the optimal process \ncontrol or to the risks of defects in the fabricated structures, and aim to produce results that can help to \nformulate design rules for improved quality, reliability and performance.  \nThe most attractive feature of the FIB that has helped the development of this technology is its \npotential for direct milling and material removal while in the same time having almost no material \nrestrictions [2,3].  In FIB milling, ion beam with certain intensity is directed to substrate  material and \nthe energised ions, when hitting the target surface, cause the transfer of the energy to the target atoms \non the surface. This leads to a collision cascade and atoms from the target surface are sputtered. By \nmoving the ion beam in a controlled manner different nano- and micro- features can be realised. The \nability to control the depth variation is the most important aspect of the FIB milling process. A \ncomputational model that can be used to predict the required ion beam dwell times for a predefined \nshape is investigated. The emphasis is on a study for validating this model by comparing the model \npredictions with experimental data for milling a trench-shaped feature.  \nNano-Imprint Forming process on the other side allows large scale pattering and fabrication of fine \nstructures at very high resolution in a very cost effective manner compared with other existing \nprocesses [4]. The key concerns in this technology relate to the process control and the subsequent \nquality of the fabricated nano- and micro- structures. The main objective is to realise the process in a \nway so that the risk of defects and imperfections is minimised. In particular, a process phenomenon of \nsignificant importance for the quality of the patterns is the material deformation and the filling of the \npattern grooves during the mould pressing step. We demonstrate the use of non-linear large \ndeformation finite element analysis with hyperelastic non-compressive material behavior to study the \neffect of process parameters (imprint pressure and temperature) and pattern related parameters (the \naspect ratio of the grooves) on the quality of the fabricated structures. The modeling results identify \ndesign rules that that can help the optimal process set up and the control of the process parameters. \n2.  Computational Modelling of FIB \nThe principle of operation for FIB is bombardment of a target surface through high energy gallium \nGa\n+\n (or other) ions. As a result of this, small amount of material sputters in the form of secondary ions, \nnatural atoms and secondary electrons. The ion beam is moved in a raster scan manner which is \ndigitally controlled over a pixel matrix defined on the target surface area. The size of a pixel is \ndetermined by the step of the beam movement. The time the ion beam spends on a pixel is called dwell \ntime. The sputtering yield is the measure for the efficiency of the material removal and depends on a \nnumber of parameters such as the ion energy, angle of incidence of the ions to the target surface, ion \nflux and mass of the ions and target material atoms. \n2.1.  Computational Model for FIB sputtering \nThe first models for simulation of ion beam milling have been limited in the sense that they tried to \nprovide predictions for the final geometry based on a particular set of FIB parameters. The \nrequirements for the FIB process at present are much more demanding than its original ion milling \nabilities. In particular, a critical control required for FIB milling is the one of the depth variation. \nA mathematical model that can be used to predict the etched shape or to calculate the dwell times \nrequired to achieve a predefined shape is investigated [5]. The model relates the milling depth and the \nion beam dwell times at the pixels placed over the target surface using a number of process \nparameters. The governing equation for the sputtering process is then discredited over each element of \n  \n \n \n \n \nthe pixel matrix so that ultimately a system of linear equations that relates the dwell times tij with the \nsputtering depth Hij at any pixel (i,j) is constructed. \nIf (xi, yj) denotes the centre of the pixel (i,j), then the sputtering at this pixel in terms of depth as a \nresult of the material removal at that pixel can be expressed as \n \ndydxt),E(Y)y,x(f\n)y,x(\nH y,xy,xjiy,xij ji0                                             (1) \n \nwhere ijH  is the sputtering depth at the point (xi, yj), )( y,x  is the ion flux at point (x,y) on the target \nsurface (cm\n-2\ns\n-2\n),  is the atomic density of the target material (atoms\/cm\n3\n), )( 0 ji y,x,EY  is the \nsputtering yield (atoms per incident ion at point (xi, yj)), tx,y is the dwell time of the ion beam at point \n(xi, yj) (seconds), )( jiy,x y,xf  is the ion beam density distribution function in two dimensions. \nThe sputtering yield in Equation (1) is function of the angle of incidence \nji y,x\n of the ion beam at \npoint (xi, yj) and the ion energy E0 as well as the type of ion source and target material. Generally, the \nyield increases from perpendicular ion beam incidence to a maximum at angle 60  to 85 , and then \nrapidly decreases due to the strong reflection at grazing incidence. The sputtering yield can be \nobtained experimentally. A software package, SRIM (The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter), can \nbe also used to predict the sputtering rate for particular ion source and target material under specified \nenergy conditions by Monte Carlo binary collision simulation [6].  \nIn FIB milling, the ion flux is not uniform and has a distribution associated with it. Typically, it is \nassumed that this distribution is Gaussian. The standard deviation of the distribution can be estimated \nby assuming that the beam spot diameter is equal to full width at half maximum (FWHM). The ion \nbeam geometry in terms of density distribution )( jiy,x y,xf , as required in the FIB model above, is \ntaken to be Gaussian bi-variate density function: \n \n     )\/(rjiy,x e)y,x(f\n22 2\n2\n2\n1\n                                                                            (2) \n \nwhere 222 )yy()xx(r ji is the radial coordinate for an ion beam focused at (x,y). \n \n2.2.  FIB Experiment and Model Validation \nTwo FIB experiments using FEI 200 FIB machine with gallium ion source and silicon wafer as the \ntarget surface are conducted. The results from the first experiment are intended to provide data on the \nactual sputtering yield, and the second test is undertaken to examine the predictive capability of the \nmodel and for model validation. \n2.2.1.  Experimental derivation of the sputtering yield \nThe FEI FIB 200 system is used to set the milling of a simple boxed shaped feature. The objective is \nto estimate the amount of sputtered material and knowing the process parameters to obtain \nexperimentally a value for the sputtering yield for the particular set of FIB process conditions. The \ntarget material used in the study is p-Silicon (B doped)-(100) orientation, and the scanned area on the \ntarget surface is selected with dimensions 5x10 m. The ion beam is set with current 350 pA \n(corresponding to beam diameter 55 nm). The beam is set to raster with 50% overlap, angle of \nincidence 0 degrees (perpendicular to the target surface), ion energy 30 keV and at dwell times of 1 s. \nThe FIB current of 350 pA with overlap 50% is associated with ion flux of 1.44e24 ions\/sec m\n2\n at the \ntarget surface. The total time of milling for this experiment is set to 460 sec this resulting in 13,890 \nbeam scans over the target area. \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe cross sectional analysis shows some variation in the depth of the produced shape ranging from \n0.883 m to 1.09 m (Fig. 1).  From the analysis profiles we calculate that the sputtered volume is \n48.176 m\n3\n. For total time of milling equal to 460 sec and ion beam current of 350 pA, the total \namount of ions delivered to the sample over this milling period of time is 1.00488e12 ions. With \nknown atomic density of the target material (5e10 atoms\/ m\n3\n), we can now evaluate the average \nsputtering yield. The calculated sputtering yield value is 2.397 atoms\/ion. This experimentally derived \nvalue is well in the range that can be found in the literature and very similar to the SRIM software \nprediction. \n \n      \nFigure 1. Cross sectional analysis of the milled shape (sputtering yield case study). \n \n2.2.2.  Model Validation \n \nThe validation example is designed with experiment of milling a step-wise parabolic trench using the \nsame FIB system (FEI 200) and the same FIB process settings as used in the previous study. The \ndesired trench has depth at the centre line 1.94 m. The target area on the silicon surface that defines \nthe trench is 10 x 10 m. \nThe parabolic step-wise cross-section of the targeted shape for the trench, as shown in Figure 2, \nfeatures five patterns. The top most (at the surface) is pattern 1, the bottom most is pattern 5. The \nwidth of each subsequent pattern is reduced by 2 m of the width of the pattern above. The width of \npattern 1 is 10 m. Note that in Figure 2 the horizontal and the vertical axis are not equally scaled. The \ndepth at each of the five patterns that realise the shape of interest are detailed in Table 1. \n \n \nFigure 2.

The model parameters are detailed in Table 2 \nand based on process milling as used in the experiment for verifying the sputtering yield values.  \n \nTable 2.

The required depth at each pixel is specified so that the sputtered shape \ncorresponds to the five pattern step-wise shaped trench targeted with this experiment. The system of \nequations is solved for the unknown dwell times. The solution is detailed in the first two columns of \nTable 3. The modelling results indicate the dwell times if the entire shape is milled in a single scan. \nIn order to apply the modelling predictions for the dwell times to a real experiment with the FEI \n200 system, the model outputs must be transformed into an appropriate input data for the machine. In \nparticular, the milling of such a shape would always be attempted not in a single beam scan but ratter \nusing a large number of scans. For a feature with variable depth such as the five level step-wise trench \nconsidered in this study, the FIB system can be set in one of the following two regimes. First option is \nto execute a fixed number of iterations across all pixels using different pixel dwell times to achieve the \nshape. Alternatively, the FIB can be run into mode where the dwell time is fixed for all pixels but \ndifferent pixels are scanned different number of times (so called pattern mode). Both settings are \nequivalent as there is a linear direct relationship between the pixel dwell time and the number of scans \nat that pixel. Because the FEI 200 can be set with fixed dwell time for all pixels and allows to define \npatterns that will be subjected to different number of scans. The model predictions are transformed \ninto an equivalent FIB set up in terms of number of scans on each pattern, respectively into total time \nfor scanning each particular pattern. The data is shown in the last two columns of Table 3. \n \nTable 3.

Pixel dwell time is predefined at 1 \ns. Because the last column in Table 3 specifies the cumulative time for milling the respective pattern \narea, in reality the total scanning time at any pattern is the incremental time from the previous milling \ntime. For example, we start with milling the area of pattern 1 for time 908 sec, then we continue with \nmilling the area which corresponds to pattern 2 for time 295 sec (the increment from pattern 1), etc. \nFigure 3 shows the output data and graphs form a cross sectional analysis undertaken to obtain \ninformation for the actual shape and the trench depth variation. Several cross sectional planes are \nexamined. Table 4 details the depths as defined and used in the model, the actual measured depths for \nthe experimentally sputtered shape, and also provides the percentage errors between the two values. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3.

The depth at all other subsequent patterns is extremely well predicted, \nwith errors less than one percent.  At the centre line of the trench the model predictions is for depth \n1.94 m versus the experimental measurement of 1.96 m. The model validation study has shown that \nthe FIB computational model can be used as a powerful tool to predict how to set the FIB system in \norder to accurately achieve the desired shape without following a trial-and-error approach. However, it \nis critical to use accurate model input data related to the process parameters, in particular the \nsputtering yield and also to account for variation in the FIB process parameters. \n3.  Computational Modelling and Simulation of Nano-Imprint Forming \nThe principle of the generic NIF process involves several steps: (A) softening (above Tg) of a thin \nfilm of formable material deposited on a substrate, (B) pressing a rigid mould which has the required \nExperiment \nModel \n  \n \n \n \n \n(negative) pattern of features onto the formable material, (C) curing the formable material by cooling \ndown to temperatures below Tg, and finally (D) releasing the mould. The sequence of these process \nsteps results in a negative replication of the mould pattern onto the formable material with process \nability for very high resolution [7]. Figure 5 outlines schematically the imprint forming process steps. \nWhereas conventional techniques use convection heating, the NIF approach considered in this \npaper uses focused microwave radiation to soften the material. This method has already been \ninvestigated for a different application by using advanced multi-physics modelling techniques to \nsimulate the physical phenomena and process issues related to microwave heating [8, 9]. The focus in \nthis work is on modelling the mould pressing step only (step B in Figure 5). \n3.1.  NIF Mould Pressing Step - Modelling and Simulation Results \nMost applications in NIF are based on polymeric materials that have suitable properties for the \nparticular method of softening the material. In this investigation Poly-Methyl MethaAcrylate (PMMA) \nwith glass transition temperature (Tg) 105\u00b0C is studied. Above Tg, the target PMMA material is soft \nand the pressing of the mould into the polymer promotes the flow of the formable material into the \nmould pattern grooves. The actual elevated temperature to which the polymer is taken and then \ndeformed is an important process parameter. The imprint temperature is not an independent process \nparameter. For example, higher imprint temperature is associated with lower imprint pressure at the \nexpense of longer process steps. \nThe imprint pressure is another process parameter that has a major impact on the quality of the \nreplication. An insufficient pressure will result in incomplete filling of the pattern grooves and may \nlead subsequently to shape defects. Conversely high imprint pressures should also be avoided as this \nwill cause high residual stresses in the cured polymer during the subsequent process steps. Therefore \none of the most important parameters to be optimised is the imprint pressure. \nThe deformation process and the process parameters are also influenced by the shape of the pattern \nand the aspect ratio (AR) of the grooves. Important relationships between the process parameters are \nidentified and design rules for accurate and defect-free replications are formulated using the modelling \nresults. In this work the effects of the step dwell times are not analysed. \n3.1.1.  Computational Model \nAbove Tg  the PMMA is assumed do behave as non-compressive rubber-like hyper-elastic body. The \nMoney-Rivlin hyper-elastic model is used to model the large deformations during the deformation \nprocess. The constants at different temperatures required by the Money-Rivlin material model used to \nsimulate the visco-elastic behavior of the PMMA above Tg are discussed and reported in reference \n[10]. In all simulations that follow the mould is modelled as a rigid body. The analysis is also set as a \nlarge strain and large deformation analysis. Finally, contact boundary and interfaces between the \nmould and the polymer are included. No friction is assumed between the mould and the polymer. The \nsimulations are carried out using ANSYS software. Hirai et al. have validated through experiments the \nabove modelling approach in the simulation of the dynamics of the deformation process for thermal \nnanoimprint lithography [11]. \nThe finite element analysis model of the pressing step is two-dimensional and comprises a single \ngroove section of the mould pattern and the associated part of the formable material. A nominal case is \ndesigned to simulate the deformation process at imprint temperature of 170\no\nC and for mould pattern \nwhere the groove has height and width of 300 nm resulting in aspect ratio AR=1. The thickness of the \nPMMA is also 300 nm. The nominal model is illustrated in Figure 6. \n3.1.1.  Effect of Imprint Pressure \nTo understand the effect of imprint pressure, the nominal case is run with several different pressures \nand the deformation profile is observed. This parametric study is used to understand what percentage \nof the groove is filled as a result of applying various in value imprint pressures P and ultimately to \nindicate the nominal pressure P0 required. The nominal pressure P0 is the pressure at which the groove \n  \n \n \n \n \nis completely filled with material. We also define a quantity called relative imprint pressure, PR. The \nrelative imprint pressure is the ratio of the applied pressure and the nominal pressure, PR=P\/P0, and \nprovides a more generic interpretation of the simulation results in terms of relative quantities. Figure 7 \nshows the simulated polymer deformation profile at four different relative imprint pressures and \ndetails the percentage, in volume, of the groove which is successfully filled. This quantity is defined as \nthe filling ratio. The relationship between the relative imprint pressure and the filling ratio is non-\nlinear. For example, at 1\/3 of the nominal imprint pressure, about half of the groove is penetrated by \nthe polymer and at imprint pressure of half the nominal pressure about 76% of the groove is \nsuccessfully filled. The existing trend is illustrated in Figure 8. \n \n(C)   Cool Down and Hold (T<Tg) (D)   Release Mould\n(B)   Press Mould and Hold (T>Tg)(A)   Heat (T>Tg)\nMould\nPolymer\nSubstrate\nApply \nPressure\nMaintain the \nApplied Pressure\n \n \n \nFigure 5.

Imprint forming model and \nboundary conditions. \n \nThe simulation results of the nominal case show that the absolute value of the required nominal \npressure P0 that can promote a complete filling of the pattern is 2.28 MPa. It is useful to consider the \nnominal imprint pressure in relation with the polymer elastic modulus, E0, at the relevant imprint \ntemperature. The required nominal imprint pressure P0 for the nominal case at imprint temperature \n170\u00b0C is approximately twice the elastic modulus, P0=1.9E0. The ratio P0\/E0 defines the normalised \nimprint pressure PN that can be used as a relative process parameter to indicate the imprint pressure \nrelations to the formable material behavior and properties. \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\nG\nro\no\nv\ne\n F\nil\nli\nn\ng\n R\na\nti\no\n [\n%\n]\nRelative Imprint Pressure, PR (= P\/P0)  \nFigure 7.

Effect of the Aspect Ratio of the Grooves in the Pattern \nThe pattern aspect ratio (AR) is defined as the ratio of groove height over groove width. In order to fill \nin completely patterns with different aspect ratios, different nominal imprint pressures are required. To \ngain knowledge on the pressure trends, three different aspect ratio cases (0.5, 1, and 1.5) are modelled \nand analysed as illustrated in Figure 9. \nThe different aspect ratios are achieved by varying the width of the grooves and by keeping the \nheight constant at 300 nm as in the nominal case. The thickness of the PMMA layer is also unchanged \nat 300 nm. The three aspect ratio cases are simulated at 170\no\nC. \npolymer\nmould\nFixed boundary\nSymmetry \nboundary\nSymmetry \nboundary\nContact \nboundary\nPR = 0.33\n50%\nPR = 0.50\n76%\nPR = 0.2\n31%\nPR = 1.00\n100%\n  \n \n \n \n \nThe results show that, for higher aspect ratio, higher imprint pressure is required to achieve a \ncomplete filling of the pattern. Figure 10 illustrates the simulated data in terms of aspect ratio vs. \nnormalised imprint pressure PN. Simulation results indicate non-linear relationship between AR and \nthe imprint pressure. With exactly the same process conditions and materials as used for the analysis \nof the nominal case, increasing only the pattern aspect ratio from 0.5 to 1.5 would require 45% higher \nimprint pressure to ensure accurate shape replication. \n \n \n \n \nAR = 0.5AR = 1.0AR = 1.5  \n \n1.50\n1.75\n2.00\n2.25\n2.50\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2\nPattern Aspect Ratio, AR ( = hg\/wg )\nN\no\nrm\na\nli\ns\ne\nd\n P\nre\ns\ns\nu\nre\n \nR\ne\nq\nu\nir\ne\nd\n, \nP\n0\n \/E\n0\n \nFigure 9.

Effect of Imprint Temperature \nThe PMMA shows different material behavior at different imprint temperatures because the viscous \nflow properties change. Therefore, the imprint temperature as a process parameter has influence on the \nother process parameters. The aim of this part of the study is to evaluate the requirements for imprint \npressure when the imprint forming is undertaken at different temperatures. To model this effect, the \ndata for PMMA visco-elastic behaviour at temperatures 150, 170 and 190\no\nC is used [10]. The \nsimulations undertaken to evaluate the relationship between the imprint temperature and the imprint \npressure are based on the nominal case pattern scenario. \nAs expected, because at higher temperatures the polymer becomes less viscous and easy to deform, \nlower imprint pressure need to be applied. As Figure 11 shows, the required imprint pressure lowers \nwhen the imprint temperature increases. For the PMMA investigated in this work and in terms of \nabsolute values, it is predicted that the imprint pressure at temperature 150\no\nC is 3.3 MPa and at \ntemperature 190\no\nC the imprint pressure is over two times lower (1.4 MPa). \n \n \n \n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n140 160 180 200\nImprint Temperature [\u00b0C]\nN\no\nrm\na\nli\ns\ne\nd\n P\nre\ns\ns\nu\nre\n \nR\ne\nq\nu\nir\ne\nd\n, \nP\n0\n \/ \nE\n0\n \nFigure 11.

Imprint temperature vs. \nnormalised imprint pressure. \n \nThe relationship between the imprint temperature and the normalised imprint pressure PN (=P0\/E0) \nprovides further insight into the existing trends. Elastic modulus E0, here, is different at different \ntemperatures. The graph in Figure 12 reveals an interesting result. The normalised imprint pressure is \nvirtually independent of the imprint temperature and, for the nominal case of the pattern geometry and \nthe PMMA being analysed, it is close to constant 1.9. \n  \n \n \n \n \n4.  Conclusions \n \nComputational approach to study two nano- and micro-manufacturing processes, FIB and NIF, is \nresearched and presented. A computational model for estimating FIB milling dwell times to achieve \npredefined shapes is validated. The analysis has shown that the model accuracy is very good. In the \ncase study reported the difference in the depth of a parabolic step-wise trench predicted with the model \nand observed in the experiment was 1%. Clearly, variations do exists in the process and there is also \nsome uncertainty associated with the process parameters. Quantifying the effect of these uncertainties \nand incorporating their effect in the model as part of a risk analysis assessment is where we focus our \ninterest at present. Additional computations that account for re-deposition effects are also considered \nthough more relevant in scenarios of milling high aspect ratio features. \nThe simulation results on the NIF process have provided insights into the potential risks associated \nwith the technology and have shown trends that can help minimising commonly observed defects. For \nthe particular PMMA polymer studied in this work the optimal imprint pressure was identified. The \nimprint pressure is the most important parameter that can result in shape imperfections if not \noptimised. This parameter depends also on other process parameters such as the imprint temperature \nand the aspect ratio of the grooves. Future work will address the effect of other process parameters \nsuch as the dwell times of the process steps and issues that are specific to the way in which the \nformable material is soften. An effort will be placed also on gathering relevant material and process \ndata required by simulation models. \n \nAcknowledgments \nThe authors acknowledge the UK funding council - ESPRC - for supporting the work detailed in this \npaper and in particular the 3D-MINTEGRATION project under grant EP\/C534212\/1. \nReferences \n[1] Desmulliez M and Topham D 2008 3D-Mintegration: the design and manufacture of 3D \nminiaturised integrated products, Proc. 2\nnd\n ESTC, London, 737-41 \n[2] Gamo K 1993 Focused Ion Beam technology, Semicond.
