The process is initiated by the patient who carries out a blood test using a glucometer developed by the company. The glucometer has both USB and Bluetooth capabilities thus allowing results to be transferred to a PC or wirelessly to a mobile phone before being forwarded  to  a  web portal.  After  results  arrive  at  a  portal,  real-time  access  to  them  is available via a PC to patients, health professionals and caregivers. Alerts are sent to health professionals notifying them of unexpected results. Health professionals are also able to update  the  patient\u2019s  EPR.  Patients  are  able  to  monitor  their  results  alongside  other information which health professionals provided. Patients can send messages to their health professional or \u201cschedule\u201d appointments via the portal.

The system provides the capability of using six types of point-of-care devices. The  process  is  initiated  by  the  patient  who  can  use  any  of  the  following  point-of-care devices: blood pressure (BP) monitor, weighing scale, coagulation meter (which measures the  clotting  ability  of  the  blood),  pulse  oximeter,  ECG  (electrocardiogram)  monitor  and glucometer. After testing, results are sent to four different types of intermediate devices, one generic type and three proprietary types. The generic type is a mobile phone or BlackBerry which is linked to point-of-care devices through Bluetooth. Of the three proprietary types, two of them are supplied by the same manufacturer Type 1A and 1B. Type 1A of the telehealth monitors transmits data through a telephone landline, while Type 1B transmits data through a GSM (Global System for Mobile Connections) mobile network. The third proprietary device is known as Type 2 and is linked for data transmission from the POC devices through a telephone landline or via Wi-Fi. The connection types to download results from point-of-care devices include Bluetooth, infrared  or  an  RS232  port.  After  passing  through  the  intermediate  devices,  results  are transferred securely via web services before being added to the EPR which is programmed to send alerts to health professionals based on predefined triggers. Health professionals are alerted either via a PC (email) or a mobile phone (SMS). The telehealth monitors can be equipped  with  scripts,  which  ask  patients  questions  regarding  their  condition  and  also reminds them of medications to take. All  the  types  of  telehealth  monitors  used  have  EU  Medical  Device  Directive  EN60601 certification [38]. In addition, the telehealth monitors (type 1A and 1B) also had US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval 510(k) [39] while the FDA approval was still pending for telehealth monitor (type 2).

The following point-of-care devices can be used in the system: glucometer, BP monitor, peak flow meter and pulse oximeter. The process begins with patients carrying out their test and manually entering results from their point-of-care device into a mobile phone preinstalled with the unique software for this task. Other parameters required to accompany the results are information relating to diet or medication and these are displayed on the mobile phone. Data are transmitted to a secure web  page  which  is  accessible  to  health  professionals  (specialist  nurses  and  GPs).  They review and analyse the data before its interpretation is sent back to the patient via their phone. The results on the phone are colour coded to ease interpretation of the information. The web page is also available to patients. The products used in offering C were certified to the following standards, ISO 13485 [40] and ISO 9001 [41].

The offering consists of three sub-sections classified based on the physical location of the entities.  Section 1 describes the service provided to patients when they are at home. The process is initiated by the patient, who can use five different types of point-of-care devices: 12 lead personal  ECG  monitor,  weighing  scale,  BP  monitor,  all-in-one  monitor  (which  measured pulse, blood pressure, breathing rate, temperature, heart rate, heart rhythm, ECG and blood oxygen  level),  and  a  \u201cMiniClinic\u201d  (which  helps  to  detect  irregular\/abnormal  heartbeat). Results from all the devices apart from the personal ECG monitor are sent via a gateway, an intermediate device that transfers results via a telephone line to the monitoring call centre. The  monitoring  call  centre  is  staffed  by  dedicated  experts  (cardiac  nurses,  cardiology registrars) who evaluate the results  and provide its interpretation via the phone to the patient. Section 2 describes how patients can transmit their results to the monitoring call centre if they are not at home. Only results from the \u201cMiniClinic\u201d can be transferred because it has storage facilities for five readings thus allowing data to be transferred via a USB MiniGate connected to a PC. Section 3 describes the service provided to GPs who use the professional version of the ECG device. The process here is initiated by the GP carrying out the test on the patient. The device  then  transmits  data  through  a  landline  telephone  to  the  monitoring  call  centre, where experts evaluate the results and provide an initial explanation verbally. A detailed report is sent later by email or fax to the GP.

The process begins with the patient using a vital signs monitor. The results are entered into any of the following three intermediate devices: PC, personal telehealth hub (similar to a personal digital assistant) or mobile phone. The personal telehealth hub is linked to the server through a telephone line. It has the capability to be personalised for each condition that  is  being  monitored  by  asking  the  patient  symptomatic  questions.  It  also  retrieves messages sent by the health professional. The results are transferred into a secure server which is accessible through a web browser to health professionals who analyse results and monitor trends before sending a message to the patient via the personal telehealth hub. Patients have access to the results. Alerts are sent to health professionals if the patient\u2019s results are unusual. This is either through an email or via SMS. GPs (primary) and specialists (secondary) health professionals can consult each other through the telehealth system to discuss the patient\u2019s progress. Personal telehealth hub Web interface?

The system can also monitor patients who have depression, drug and alcohol addiction, are obese, are stopping smoking and have had a stroke. The process begins with the patient using either of five different types of point-of-care devices which included weighing scale, BP monitor, glucometer, peak flow meter and pulse oximeter. Results are sent to a telehealth hub before being sent on to a  server.  Results  are  accessible  to  health  professionals  in  order  to  assess  the  patient\u2019s health, and compliance with current medication regimes etc. They are also accessible to caregivers. Health professionals can set up alerts to be triggered by unusual results entered by patients. They can also configure the hub with personalised questionnaires. The hub records  the  patient\u2019s  response  as  well  as  delivering  other  messages  which  the  health professional may have sent. The patient\u2019s results are updated on an EPR located at the GP surgery.

The process  is  initiated  by  the device  prompting  the patient  to  perform  their test. The patient  can  use  eight  different  types  of  point-of-care  devices  including  BP  monitor, coagulation  meter,  glucometer,  ECG  monitor,  peak  flow  meter,  weighing  scale,  pulse oximeter and temperature probe. The results are sent via a serial port, infrared or Bluetooth to two types of telehealth monitors where type 1 is linked into the system via a telephone line and type 2 has GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) capabilities to a GSM network. The telehealth monitors also pose personalised questions to the patient based on their results. These data are transferred automatically to a telehealth software and displayed in a colour coded  format  thus  allowing  high  priority  issues  to  be  quickly  identified  by  health professionals who review and analyse the data to assess the patient\u2019s wellbeing. Health professionals are alerted via SMS or email if the patient\u2019s results are extreme or if the patient did not send any results.

The process  is  initiated  by  the device  prompting  the patient  to  perform  their test.  The patient can use six different types of point-of-care devices namely BP monitor, glucometer, pulse  oximeter,  peak  flow  meter,  weighing  scale  and  ECG  monitor.  While  taking measurements,  patients  can  speak  to  the  health  professional  on  the  phone  to  obtain additional advice and support. Results and responses from questionnaires are sent to the telehealth monitor via a telephone line or via wireless GPRS (if a telephone line was not available). The telehealth monitor has the added advantage that it could be used in a multiuser environment such as a nursing home. Results are encrypted before being stored in two remote databases to increase data security. A web portal is available which provides access to  the  results.  Access  to  data  are  provided  to  health  professionals,  patients  and  their caregivers.

The process is initiated by the intermediate device prompting the patient to carry out a test known as a \u2018health session\u2019. During the health session, the patient can watch informative videos  about  their  condition.  The  patient  can  use  five  different  types  of  point-of-care devices  which  included  BP  monitor,  glucometer,  pulse  oximeter,  peak  flow  meter  and weighing scale. The sessions allow patients to measure vital signs, respond to questions to help assess their health, receive useful information and complete surveys. The intermediate device  has  audio  and  video  capabilities  to  enable  visual  interaction  with  the  health professional. Results from the point-of-care devices are sent to the intermediate device initially before they are encrypted and sent to a remote database. At the end of the health session, data are accessed by authorised health professionals from the database via a health care management suite (a web interface). The health care management suite enables health professionals  to  modify  the  patient\u2019s  medication  or  health  routine.  It  also  sends  alerts, presented in a triage format, to health professionals when the patient\u2019s results are extreme. Health  professionals  can  confer  with  each  other  based  on  information  obtained  during health  sessions.  Messages  can  be  sent  to  the  patient  via  the  intermediate  device.  The intermediate  device  has  the  CE  mark  showing  conformation  to  the  EU  Medical  Device Directive and it also has FDA approval 510(k) [39].

The  process  begins  with  the  patient  using  one  of  the  following  point-of-care  devices: weighing scale, BP monitor, pulse oximeter or glucometer. The results are sent to a set top box wirelessly via Bluetooth for the weighing scale and BP monitor; and via a USB cable for the  glucometer.  Results  from  the  pulse  oximeter  and  the  patient\u2019s  responses  to  health assessment questions are manually entered through a TV channel. From the set top box, the results are forwarded via broadband to a secure server. Results are accessible to authorized health  professionals  via  a  web  interface.  In  addition  to  reviewing  results,  health professionals can create and modify the patient\u2019s care plan based on their progress. This care  plan  includes  questionnaires  which  are  configured  by  the  health professionals  and customized to each patient. Health professionals are alerted when patient\u2019s results do not fall within the specified thresholds and a follow-up questionnaire is sent to the patient to confirm their results. Using the television and a remote control, the patient can access their results, presented in a graphical format, to compare it with targets set by the health professional.

Questionnaires were used to \nvalidate the diagrammatical representations of the models with a response rate of \n55%. \nResults: The models were classified as possessing four sections: preparing for data \ntransfer, data transfer, information generation and information transfer from health \nprofessional to patient.  \nIn preparing for data transfer, basic data entry was automated in most systems though \nadditional inputs (i.e. information about diet, lifestyle and medication) could be \nentered before the data was sent into the telehealth system.  \nFor the data transfer aspect, results and additional inputs were sent to intermediate \ndevices, which were connectors between point-of-care devices, patients and health \nprofessionals. Data were then forwarded to either a web portal, a remote database or \na monitoring\/call centre.  \nInformation generation was either through computational methods or through the \nexpertise of health professionals.  \nInformation transfer to the patient occurred in four forms: email, telehealth monitor \nmessage, text message or phone call.  \nConclusion: On comparing the models, three generic models were outlined. Five \ndifferent forms of information exchange between users of the system were identified: \n 3 \npatient-push, system-stimulation, dialogue, health professional-pull and observation. \nPatient-push and health professional-pull are the dominant themes from the \ntelehealth offerings evaluated. \n \n 4 \n1 Introduction \n1.1 Definitions of Telehealth  \nTelehealth is defined as \u201cthe use of information, computing and telecommunications \ntechnologies to provide\u201d health related services when health professionals and \npatients are separated by a distance [1]. Koch has added that telehealth developed \nfrom telemedicine but has extended to \u201chealth promotion and disease prevention\u201d [2].  \nTelemedicine has several definitions: the practice of medicine between health \nprofessionals and patients when they are not in the same location [3]; the exchange of \ninformation between multiple health professionals as a means of training and \neducation [4]; facilitating clinical consultations through an electronic medium e.g. \nthrough the telephone, videoconference and email [5]; using telecommunications \ntechnologies for exchanging health information and also the provision of services [6]. \nIn summary, the goal of telehealth is to provide medical care at a distance in an \nefficient manner via a number of media. \n1.2 Benefits of telehealth for point-of-care devices \nDevices which enable testing and also aid in delivering a form of therapy near a patient \nare known as point-of-care (POC) devices [7]. Glucometers [8, 9] and peak flow meters \n[10] are examples of point-of-care testing (POCT) devices used within the home for \nmonitoring long term conditions such as diabetes and asthma respectively. At \nsubsequent appointments with their health professional, results recorded by patients \n 5 \ncan be reviewed, and patients may be informed to either maintain or alter their \ncurrent lifestyle routines [11, 12]. \nPoint-of-care devices are not limited to being used in a specific location as they can be \nused in the home of the patient, the GP surgery or in hospitals [13]. Coupling this \nfeature with telehealth therefore extends their functionalities.  \nThe case for telehealth being used in conjunction with point-of-care devices is based \non perceived benefits such as the following:  \n Helping to improve patient compliance with medication. Mao et al. described \nhow a mobile pharmacy service system utilizing SMS was used to help improve \nmedication compliance [14]. Text messages were sent to patients reminding \nthem to take their medication prior to the time it was due to be taken. It \ndemonstrated that patients found the messages helpful in complying with their \nmedication.  \n Helping to empower patients as they become more knowledgeable and \nconfident about managing their condition. Franklin et al. described a system \nknown as \u201cSweet Talk\u201d which was designed to help young people with diabetes \nmanage their condition through text messaging [15].Personalized messages \nreminding patients of their goals were sent to them based on their profiles. The \npatients were also encouraged to send in messages with relevant information \nabout diabetes.  \n Speeding up the rates of change of medication. Brown et al. showed that \npatients with diabetes may need to change their medication and the time taken \n 6 \nto do this may be between 27-35 months, however this time could be reduced \nthrough telehealth since regular updates of the patients\u2019 results could help \nhealth professionals make changes to medications quickly [16].  \n Supplementing care provided to patients in between visits to health \nprofessionals. Azar and Gabbay noted this to occur when they investigated \nwhether electronic uploading of glucose results was an advantage compared \nwith manual methods [17]. They found that although telehealth did not make \nan impact on diabetes management by people with type 1 diabetes, it helped \nthose with type 2 diabetes to manage their condition [17]. \n1.3 Drivers for Telehealth \nSpeedie et al. noted two assumptions of current delivery of care to patients which will \nbe altered by telehealth [18]. They are: provision of care to patients is in a fixed \n\u201cgeographic\u201d location and as \u201cepisodic\u201d visits. The UK Department of Health (DH) also \nadvocates that technology can be used to improve the delivery of healthcare by \nallowing remote patient monitoring. This allows patients to stay in their own homes \nrather than restricting them to a hospital setting [19]. To support this, the Department \nof Health is currently running a program known as \u2018Whole System Demonstrators\u2019 \nwhich is investigating the effect of telehealth and telecare systems on the monitoring \nof patients and how they may improve patient lifestyles [20]. Prior to the UK \nDepartment of Health program, several systems have emerged to deliver healthcare \nremotely. Some of these are being offered as pilot projects while others have been \n 7 \ndeployed on a larger scale. The UK was therefore selected as it provided several \nchoices of telehealth systems that have been deployed.  \n1.4 Motivation  \nThere is little available in the literature on different offerings of telehealth. Kruger has \ndescribed three different models, \u201cbasic\u201d, \u201cadvanced\u201d and \u201ccloud-based\u201d representing \ninformation flow schemes between components of \u201ceHealth\u201d systems [21]. eHealth \nsystems refer to telehealth systems using the internet only as a means of exchanging \ninformation and therefore cannot be applied generically. Telehealth, however as \ndefined in section 1.1 extends to other forms of telecommunications technology. This \npaper is therefore an analysis of telehealth offerings rather than eHealth offerings with \nthe aim of identifying its overall structure and the data\/information flows that are \npresent. \n1.5 Research Questions \nThis paper aimed to derive models of information exchange for telehealth offerings \nwhich are currently available.  \nThe paper posed three research questions concerning telehealth systems. \n1. What are the paths of information transfer in the telehealth offerings? \n2. What types of entities form part of telehealth offerings? \n3. Can a standard model of information transfer in a telehealth offering be \nestablished? \n 8 \n2 Methodology \nThe criteria for selection of the data set of the paper were restricted to offerings \navailable in the UK and those based on point-of-care devices, specifically those devices \nwhich could be used in the home.  \nAn online search was performed through Google to identify what telehealth systems \nwere currently available in the UK. The keywords used in the search included: point-of-\ncare devices, telehealth, telemedicine, eHealth, home telehealth solutions UK, \ntelemedicine services and telehealth companies. As the paper\u2019s focus was on \ntelehealth, telecare was excluded as a search term. \nThe UK Telemedicine and E-health Information Service (TEIS) provided by the \nUniversity of Portsmouth [22] was also a useful resource in identifying organizations \nwithin the UK offering telehealth. \n \n2.1 Modelling the telehealth offerings \nCompany documentation of each offering was evaluated. The sub-sections of each \ntelehealth system were defined and the routes for the generation and exchange of \ninformation between sections of the telehealth system were identified.  \nEach offering, comprising the system sub-sections and the information exchange \nroutes, was depicted diagrammatically. Formalised tools such as UML data flow \ndiagrams or IDEF0 were considered for this task, but they lacked the necessary \nflexibility to represent section types and information exchange. Therefore, symbols \n 9 \nbased on the type of entities identified were defined. This symbol set is shown in Table \nI.  \nWhere the direction of information flow could be discerned this was given a direction \narrow in the symbol set. In certain cases an assumed direction of information transfer \nis given where this could be inferred from but was not explicitly mentioned in the \ninformation available.  \n 10 \nTable I \u2013 Key to symbols used to draw telehealth offerings. \nSymbol Meaning \nPatient  \nPatient \nPoint-of-care \nDevice\n \nThe point-of-care device labelled appropriately with the right name \n \nGeneric intermediate device that displays data (e.g. mobile phone) \n Proprietary intermediate device that displays data (e.g. telehealth monitor) \n Generic intermediate device that does not display data (e.g. landline phone) \n \nProprietary intermediate device that does not display data \nHealth \nProfessionals \n(HP)  \nHealth professional \nCarers  \nCaregivers (usually non health professionals) \n \nDatabase \n \nPortal (Web\/Online interface) \n \nCall centre \n \nElectronic Patient Record (EPR) \n Firewall \n Direction of data\/information transfer \n \nDirection of assumed data\/information transfer. (Some aspects of the diagrams \nwere not explicitly specified hence assumptions were made as to when data \ntransfer occurred). \n List of multiple tasks that can happen in an entity \n \n \n2.2 Validation of the telehealth offerings \nTo validate the diagrammatic depiction of the offerings as being accurate \nrepresentations of the companies\u2019 telehealth offerings, questionnaires were sent to \n 11 \nthe organizations via email. The questions posed asked the organizations to make \nchanges to the diagrams as needed.  \n 12 \n3 Results \nThis section provides information about the defined entities used to depict the \nofferings and the organizations surveyed. The detailed description of each of the 12 \ntelehealth offerings referred to as offering A to L can be found in the supplementary \nmaterial.  \n \n3.1 Entities \nEleven entities were identified as being present across the offerings: the patient, point-\nof-care devices, intermediate devices that had data display capabilities, such as \ntelehealth monitors and mobile phones, intermediate devices that did not have data \ndisplay capabilities, health professionals, care givers, databases, \u2018web portals\u2019, call \ncentres, electronic patient records (EPRs) and firewalls. \nThe above entities are defined as follows:  \n Patients are the primary users of the system.  \n Point-of-care devices enable testing or therapy to be administered at the \npatient\u2019s location; examples are glucometers and blood pressure monitors.  \n Intermediate devices are defined here as connectors between point-of-care \ndevices, patients and health professionals. Some are generic devices that have \nbeen adapted to a telehealth system, for example mobile phones; others are \nproprietary devices.  \n Health professionals are doctors or nurses.  \n 13 \n Caregivers provide a form of care to the patient but are not necessarily a health \nprofessional.  \n Databases are used for storing results from the devices.  \n Portals are web-based interfaces available to both patients and health \nprofessionals to view current and historical results obtained from the point-of-\ncare devices.  \n Call centres are central locations used to receive phone calls to aid in the \nadministration of a product or service.  \n EPRs are defined as electronic records of the patient\u2019s medical history usually \naccessible only to health professionals.  \n Firewalls are part of a computer system which provide security by preventing \nunauthorised access and allowing authorised communications. \n \n3.2 Organizations evaluated \nEleven organizations were found to offer telehealth services currently in use within the \nUK (AxSys Technology Ltd [23], Broomwell HealthWatch [24, 25], Docobo [26], Entra \nHealth Systems Ltd [27] \/MyGlucoHealth [28], Intel [29, 30], Philips [31], Project E-vita \n[32], Telehealth Solutions [33, 34], OBS Medical Ltd [35], Tunstall [36] and Tynetec \n[37]. Twelve offerings were identified as one organization offered two systems. \nThe telehealth systems were all used for monitoring one or more chronic conditions \nnamely: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart \n 14 \nfailure (CHF), diabetes and hypertension. One offering was for managing a single \ncondition, while eleven were for managing multiple conditions. \n \n3.3 Baseline Model \nA baseline model (Figure 1) for information exchange was deduced from the telehealth \nofferings. For readability, it is shown in this section to enable the function of each \nentity to be seen through each telehealth offering, however further details of how it \nwas derived are shown in section 4.3. \n \nPatient\nHealth \nProfessionals \n(HP)\nPCuses\nPOC \nDevice (s)\nResults sent Results accessedWeb portal\nAccess to patient data\nDirect data\/information transfer\nKey\nIndirect data\/information transfer\n \nFigure 1 \u2013 The baseline model for information exchange: all systems have these functions \n \n3.4 Validating results \nThe time period given to receive the responses back from the organizations was two \nmonths and 55% of the them (Offerings B, D, E, H, I, L) responded within this time \nframe. All the diagrams for which feedback was received were modified with \nsignificant changes made to offering D and I. \n 15 \n \n3.5 Constraints by organizations when implementing telehealth \nofferings. \nWhen the organizations were asked whether they had any constraints in the design of \ntheir system, B, D and J provided information that they were not operating under \nexplicit constraints when implementing the telehealth system. \nFor offering E, the constraints were small, light and simple devices suitable for use by \nelderly people. In addition, they had to be suitable for connecting to a telephone line. \nThe remaining organizations did not respond or return their questionnaire. \n \n3.6 Standards \nDescriptions of four of the offerings stated that they used standards. Offering B had \nmedical devices with EN60601 certification of safety and performance of the medical \ndevice [38]. Offering C and E used medical devices that were certified to ISO 13485 a \nstandard for quality control [40]. Offering C also had ISO 9001 certification [41]. The \nglucometer in offering A and intermediate device in offering I carried the CE mark thus \nshowing conformation to \u201cessential requirements\u201d within Europe for health, safety \nand environmental protection. The intermediate devices in offering B and I had FDA \napproval which meant that they were suitable for use in USA. (See Table VI for details). \n 16 \n4 Discussion \nTabulated comparisons of the offerings are given tables II - VI. Table II shows the types \nof chronic diseases being managed by the telehealth offering. Table III represents the \ncomparisons of the sections of the offerings prior to the transfer of data within the \ntelehealth system. Table IV represents comparisons when the user transfers data into \nthe telehealth system.

Following this, data \nwere then transferred to either of the following locations: a web portal i.e. an online \nweb interface: Offerings (A, B, C, G, H, J); a remote database: Offerings (E, F, I, L); and a \nmonitoring\/call centre: Offerings (D, K). In Offerings (E, F, I, L), data were forwarded to \na web portal after being initially transferred to a remote database.  \n 19 \nTable IV \u2013 Comparison of the information path diagrams \u2013 data transfer from patient to health \nprofessional \n  \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nA\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nB\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nC\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nD\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nE\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nF \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nG\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nH\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nI \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nJ \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nK\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nL \nResults \ntransferred \nthrough \nintermediate \ndevices that \ndisplay data \nProprietary \nintermediate \ndevice  \n \uf0fc   \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc  \nAdapted \nintermediate \ndevice  \n\uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc       \uf0fc \nResults \ntransferred \nthrough \nintermediate \ndevices that \ndo not \ndisplay data \nProprietary \nintermediate \ndevice \n   \uf0fc      \uf0fc  \uf0fc \nAdapted \nintermediate \ndevice \n   \uf0fc         \nMode of data \ntransfer: \nThrough \nwireless \ncommunication \n\uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \nThrough cables \uf0fc \uf0fc     \uf0fc     \uf0fc \n \nInformation generation and Information transfer from health professional to a \npatient \n \nTable V illustrates the results discussed in the next two sections. The second stage of \nthe information path relates to the translation of data into information of which two \nmethods were noted in the evaluation. \nInformation generation through computational methods \nIn this scenario, data was retrieved from a server before being analysed through \npredefined algorithms which can be configured by health professionals. This was seen \nin 11 offerings (A, B, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L), where the results are initially analysed \nthrough software. From this, alerts can be sent to the health professionals when \n 20 \nunexpected results occurred (all cases apart from offerings C & J). In offering B, health \nprofessionals were also alerted when new data were added. Results were presented to \nthe health professionals in a colour coded format in four offerings (B, G, H, I). This \nenabled high priority results to be addressed quickly.  \nIt is important to note that the colour coded signals alerting the health professionals \nmay occasionally have false positives and false negatives, however the organizations \ndo not provide details of their algorithms to generate the alerts therefore it was \ndifficult to assess this. \n \nInformation generation through experts \nIn this scenario, no computational algorithms were used to analyse results in order to \narrive at the patient diagnosis. Rather, the expertise of the health professional sufficed \nin making a decision which was sent back to the patient. This was demonstrated in \noffering D where GPs sent the patient\u2019s ECG results via the telephone and cardiology \nexperts interpreted the ECG results and provided immediate feedback to the GP.  \n \nInformation transfer from health professional to a patient \nIn all cases, results were accessed by health professionals via a PC. Although in offering \nD, health professionals had a more real-time contact with the patient, since the results \nwere transmitted over the telephone line and discussed immediately.  \n 21 \nThe traffic light colour coded system in offering B helped to identify urgent and \nextreme cases that may be missed if a manual method was employed. In some cases \nthey passed on a message to the patient regarding the status of their result.  \nAll the offerings evaluated followed the pattern of indirect data transfer in which \nanother device other than the point-of-care device utilised transmitted the results to a \nportal or server. Indirect data transfer is also known as \u2018store and forward\u2019 and it is \ngenerally suitable for non-emergency situations [42]. \n 22 \nTable V \u2013 Comparison of the information path diagrams \u2013 information generation and information \ntransfer to patient \n \n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nA\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nB\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nC\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nD\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nE \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nF \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nG\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nH\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nI \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nJ \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nK\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nL \nRoles of \nHP \nNumber of \ntypes of HP \n1 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 \nDescription of \nthe role of 1\nst\n \nHP C\nlin\nic\nia\nn\n \nP\nh\nys\nic\nia\nn\n \nSp\nec\nia\nlis\nt \nn\nu\nrs\ne\n \nG\nP\n \nG\nP\n \nC\nlin\nic\nia\nn\n \nG\nP\n \nC\nlin\nic\nia\nn\n \nG\nP\n \nC\nar\ne \nag\nen\ncy\n \np\ner\nso\nn\nn\nel\n \nH\nea\nlt\nh\nca\nre\n \np\nro\nfe\nss\nio\nn\nal\n \nN\nu\nrs\ne\n \nDescription of \nthe role of 2\nnd\n \nHP \n  \nG\nP\n\/N\nu\nrs\ne\n \nC\nar\nd\nio\nlo\ngy\n \nEx\np\ner\nt \nSp\nec\nia\nlis\nt \n \nC\nlin\nic\nia\nn\n \n \nSp\nec\nia\nlis\nt \n  \nSp\nec\nia\nlis\nt \nModes of \ncontact \nHP alerted if \nextreme results \nencountered \n\uf0fc \uf0fc  \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc  \uf0fc \uf0fc \nHP contacts \npatient \nindirectly i.e. \nthrough a \nmessage \n \uf0fc \uf0fc  \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc  \uf0fc \uf0fc \nFeedback \nprovided to \npatient via \n(phone call [p], \ntext [sms], \nemail [e], \ntelehealth \nmonitor \nmessage [tmm]) \ne,\n s\nm\ns \ntm\nm\n \nsm\ns \np\n \ntm\nm\n \ntm\nm\n \ntm\nm\n \ntm\nm\n \ntm\nm\n \n \ntm\nm\n \ntm\nm\n \nHP contacts \npatient directly \n   \uf0fc     \uf0fc   \uf0fc \nMessage to \nremind patient: \nTo\n t\nes\nt \n&\n t\no\n \nta\nke\n \nm\ned\nic\nat\nio\nn\n \n \nTo\n t\nak\ne \nm\ned\nic\nat\nio\nn\n \n   \nTo\n t\nes\nt \nTo\n t\nes\nt \nTo\n t\nes\nt \nTo\n t\nes\nt \n \nTo\n t\nak\ne \nm\ned\nic\nat\nio\nn\n \nTo\n t\nak\ne \nm\ned\nic\nat\nio\nn\n \nPatient can \ncontact HP \ndirectly \n   \uf0fc    \uf0fc     \nUser \nInterface \nPortal \n(Web\/Online \ninterface) \n\uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \n \n 23 \nData storage and accessibility  \nThe comparison of data storage and accessibility characteristics of the offerings is \ngiven in Table VI. Offerings (A, B, F, K) utilise an EPR provided by the organizations \nwhich has the medical history of the patient. The essence of storing this historical data \nwas for reference purposes when a patient\u2019s medical history is being tracked. Offering \nF and H provided two databases for storing data. In offering H, the databases were \nphysically stored in different locations to aid data recovery during disasters and to \nsupport accessibility to data and guarantee data safety when applications fail to \nfunction thus providing extra security. \n \nTable VI \u2013 Comparison of the information path diagrams \u2013 data storage and accessibility \n  \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nA\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nB\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nC\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nD\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nE\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nF \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nG\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nH\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nI \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nJ \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nK\n \nO\nff\ne\nri\nn\ng \nL \nData Storage Data repository     \uf0fc \uf0fc  \uf0fc \uf0fc   \uf0fc \nElectronic \nPatient\/Medical \nRecord \n\uf0fc \uf0fc    \uf0fc     \uf0fc  \nAccessibility \nto data \nSecured access \nto data by HP \n  \uf0fc   \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc   \uf0fc \nPatients can \naccess stored \ndata \n\uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc \uf0fc  \uf0fc \uf0fc   \uf0fc \nCaregivers can \naccess patient \ndata \n\uf0fc     \uf0fc  \uf0fc   \uf0fc  \nOther Firewall      \uf0fc       \nUses standards   \uf0fc \uf0fc  \uf0fc    \uf0fc    \n \n \n 24 \n4.2 Features of baseline, dominant and fully-featured models \nBaseline model \nThe baseline model (Figure 1) shows that five entities were common to all the \nofferings: the patient, point-of-care device, web portal, PC and health professional. In \nthe baseline model, patients use a point-of-care device to generate results; the results \nare sent to a web portal, where they were accessed through a PC (an intermediate \ndevice) by the health professional. \n \nDominant model \nThe dominant model (Figure 2) represents the entities that were present in more than \nsix of the offerings. In addition to the entities found in the baseline model, the \ndominant model included additional intermediate devices and remote databases. \nResults from point-of-care devices are sent via an intermediate device to either a \nremote database, before being accessible through a web portal, or directly to the web \nportal. \n \n 25 \nPatient\n(12 models)\nHealth \nProfessionals \n(HP)\n(11 models)\nIntermediate \ndevice\n(11 models)\nuses\nPOC Device (s)\n(12 models)\n(A)\nInformation sent back to the patient\n(10 models)\nResults sent\n(7 models)\nWeb portal\n(11 models)\nResults sent\n(4 models)\nResults sent\n(4 models)\nAlerts sent when patient\u2019s results are extreme\n(9 models)\nAccess to patient data\nSecure remote \ndatabase\n(A): Results sent wirelessly or via cables\nPC\n(11 models)\nAccess to patient data\nPatient sends additional inputs\n(9 models)\n \nFigure 2 \u2013 The dominant model showing the entities that appear in more than 6 of the offerings \n \nFully-featured model \nThe \u201cfully-featured\u201d model representing all the defined entities along with their \nfunctionalities observed from all the offerings is shown in Figure 3. Each of the 12 \ntelehealth offerings exhibited useful features that would aid information exchange, \nalthough as expected, they were not all present in each offering, hence this fully-\nfeatured hypothetical model shows the complexity of the possible capabilities. The \nmain differences between this and the baseline model are: \n Patients were reminded to either carry out their test or to take their \nmedication. \n The intermediate device could initiate the testing process thus helping the \npatient to comply with regular monitoring.  \n Results from point-of-care devices and responses to questionnaires (data) were \nsent wirelessly or via cables to the intermediate device. \n 26 \n A telephone link was added to enable the patient to speak to the health \nprofessional to aid in answering queries during the testing process.  \n Patients could access their results through the web portal and also through the \nintermediate device.  \n Results and data were encrypted before being transferred from the \nintermediate device that displays data to a database. \n For an intermediate device that does not display data, results were sent via a \nlandline telephone to a call centre to be interpreted by health professionals. \nThe interpreted information was transferred to a remote database to be \nstored. \n For data sent to a call centre, interpreted results were communicated to the \npatients through a landline telephone.  \n Results and data were sent through a firewall and stored further in another \nremote database to increase security. \n Results and data were accessible to health professionals through a web portal \nvia a PC. \n Health professionals could: create triggers on the patients\u2019 records; set up \npersonalised schedules for the patients; review and analyze patients\u2019 results; \nand provide suggestions to patients on how to improve their results. They have \nadditional privileges which allow them to filter the patient\u2019s result based on its \npriority level.  \n Alerts were sent to health professionals via mobile phones or PCs when \npatient\u2019s results were unusual.  \n 27 \n Specialists were available in the system so that they could be consulted by \ngeneral practitioners to exchange information about the patient. \n An EPR was added to allow health professionals to update the patient\u2019s \nrecords. \n Caregivers were integrated into the system to help track the patient\u2019s condition \nand provide additional support to patients to enable compliance to routine. \nFrom the above it can be seen that the main difference between fully-featured, \ndominant and baseline systems is the number of service elements for patients and \nhealth professionals that the fully-featured model adds to the system. It seems likely \nthat telehealth providers can and will seek to differentiate themselves from \ncompetitors via such service provision. \n \n 28 \n \nFigure 3 \u2013 A model comprising functionalities observed in all the offerings for information exchange \n \nForms of information exchange in telehealth systems \nFrom this evaluation, different ways of information exchange between users of the \nsystem have been identified. They are listed in the order that information flows \nthrough: \n Patient-push: The testing process was initiated by patients, who send their test \nresults to health professionals. Examples of this are seen in all offerings apart \nfrom (G, H, I) and in the baseline, dominant and fully-featured model. \n 29 \n System-stimulation: Patients are prompted to carry out their test or take their \nmedication through reminders. Examples of this are seen in offerings (B, F, G, \nH, I, K, L) and in the fully-featured model. \n Dialogue: Patients and health professionals have a live dialogue either on the \nphone or through video conferencing to discuss results and progress of \npatients. Examples of this are in offerings (D, I, H) and in the fully-featured \nmodel. \n Health professional-pull: Health professionals set up alerts to be informed \nwhen patients\u2019 results arrive each time or when patients\u2019 results are outside \nspecified limits. Examples of this are seen in all the offerings apart from (C & J) \nand in the dominant and fully-featured model. \n Observation: Caregivers can access information about the patient thus \nchecking their compliance with monitoring and encouraging the patient. \nExamples of this are seen in offerings (A, F, H, K) and in the fully-featured \nmodel. \nPatient-push and health professional-pull are the leading themes from these \napproaches. \n \n5 Strengths and Weaknesses of the study \nThe strengths of the study are: Providing an overall structure of telehealth offerings for \nmanaging chronic diseases by showing the entities used. Highlighting the commonality \nin the characteristics of telehealth offerings. It has shown three generic models of \n 30 \ntelehealth offerings of which the level of complexity is based on the requirements of \nthe telehealth system. \nThe weaknesses of the study are: The effectiveness of such telehealth offerings has not \nbeen evaluated. The telehealth models refer to the management of chronic diseases \nand may not be applicable to other areas of healthcare without further work. \n \n6 Conclusion \nThe paper presented models of information exchange in the UK telehealth industry \nwith specific focus on telehealth offerings containing point-of-care devices.  \nThe models were classified as possessing four sections: preparing for data transfer, \ndata transfer, information generation and information transfer from health \nprofessional to patient. \nIn preparing for data transfer stage, the testing process was initiated by the patient in \nmost systems. Most of the systems also provided automated data entry. Additional \ninputs, apart from the result, could be entered in most systems before the data was \nsent into the telehealth system. \nFor the data transfer stage, results and additional inputs were sent to an intermediate \ndevice, which were connectors between point-of-care devices, patients and health \nprofessionals. Data were then forwarded to either a web portal, a remote database or \na monitoring\/call centre.  \nThe information generation stage took two forms: (i) information through \ncomputational methods where data was analysed through predefined algorithms and \n 31 \nalerts were triggered when unusual results occurred; (ii) information through the \nexpertise of health professionals. GPs could confer with specialists to discuss the \npatient\u2019s health and progress. Information transfer to the patient occurred in four \nforms: email, telehealth monitor message, text message or phone call. Health \nprofessionals were alerted when unusual results were recorded by patients. \nReminders were sent to patients in some offerings to either carry out their test or to \ntake their medication. \nA further aspect for the offerings included data storage and accessibility. Databases \nwere explicitly identified in five of the offerings and four of the offerings also used \nElectronic Patient Records (EPRs). Data were encrypted in some cases to provide \nadditional security before it was stored. \nFive different forms of information exchange between users of the system have been \nidentified: patient push, system-stimulation, dialogue, health professional-pull and \nobservation. Patient-push and health professional-pull are the dominant themes from \nthe telehealth offerings evaluated. \nOn comparing the offerings, a baseline model was outlined comprising five of the \neleven defined entities. The main difference between the \u2018fully-featured\u2019 and baseline \nmodel is the addition of numerous service elements to the system, for both patients \nand health professionals. It seems likely that telehealth providers can and will seek to \ndifferentiate themselves from competitors via such service provision. \n 32 \n7 References \n1. Fitzmaurice JM.

The glucometer has both USB and Bluetooth capabilities thus \nallowing results to be transferred to a PC or wirelessly to a mobile phone before being \nforwarded to a web portal. After results arrive at a portal, real-time access to them is \navailable via a PC to patients, health professionals and caregivers. Alerts are sent to health \nprofessionals notifying them of unexpected results. Health professionals are also able to \nupdate the patient\u2019s EPR. Patients are able to monitor their results alongside other \ninformation which health professionals provided. Patients can send messages to their health \nprofessional or \u201cschedule\u201d appointments via the portal. \n \nGlucometer\nCompany A \nportal\nPC\nPatient Health \nProfessionals \n(HP)\nResults via USB cable\nResults wirelessly via \nBluetooth\nAccesses portal\nPatients can access portal to: \nhave real-time access to view results and how it has been analysed\nView online information and other tools\n(1)\nReal-time access to patient's results\nAnalyses patient\u2019s results\nCan see an overview of the patient results\nCan alter patient's medication\nUpdates patient EPR\nuses\nMobile \nPhone\nResults sent \nto portal\nCarers\nReal-time access \nto patient\u2019s \nresults via a PC \nPC\nResults are accessed by \ncarer\nAlerts HP for \nunexpected results\nPC\n(1)\nAccess EPR \nvia PC\nResults displayed \non PC\nAccess to results\nAlerts and reminders sent to patient\nAlerts and reminders sent to patient\nMobile \nPhone\nSends alert about \npatient\nReceives alert about patient condition\nEPR\nFigure 1 \u2013 Offering A representing a telehealth system for diabetes management \n \n1.2 Offering B \nOffering B (Figure 2) represents a system for monitoring chronic conditions such as diabetes, \nCHF, COPD and hypertension\/high blood pressure. The system provides the capability of \nusing six types of point-of-care devices.  \nThe process is initiated by the patient who can use any of the following point-of-care \ndevices: blood pressure (BP) monitor, weighing scale, coagulation meter (which measures \nthe clotting ability of the blood), pulse oximeter, ECG (electrocardiogram) monitor and \nglucometer.  \nAfter testing, results are sent to four different types of intermediate devices, one generic \ntype and three proprietary types. The generic type is a mobile phone or BlackBerry which is \nlinked to point-of-care devices through Bluetooth. Of the three proprietary types, two of \nthem are supplied by the same manufacturer Type 1A and 1B. Type 1A of the telehealth \nmonitors transmits data through a telephone landline, while Type 1B transmits data through \na GSM (Global System for Mobile Connections) mobile network. The third proprietary device \nis known as Type 2 and is linked for data transmission from the POC devices through a \ntelephone landline or via Wi-Fi. \nThe connection types to download results from point-of-care devices include Bluetooth, \ninfrared or an RS232 port. After passing through the intermediate devices, results are \ntransferred securely via web services before being added to the EPR which is programmed \nto send alerts to health professionals based on predefined triggers. Health professionals are \nalerted either via a PC (email) or a mobile phone (SMS). The telehealth monitors can be \nequipped with scripts, which ask patients questions regarding their condition and also \nreminds them of medications to take. \nAll the types of telehealth monitors used have EU Medical Device Directive EN60601 \ncertification [38]. In addition, the telehealth monitors (type 1A and 1B) also had US Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA) approval 510(k) [39] while the FDA approval was still pending \nfor telehealth monitor (type 2). \n \nTelehealth \nMonitor \n(type 1A)\nHealth \nProfessionals \n(HP)\nGlucometer\nWeighing \nScale\nBP \nMonitor\nPulse \noximeter\nCoagulation \nmeter\nuses\nuses\nuses\nuses\nuses\nECG\nmonitor\nuses\n(A)\nData encoded to ensure \npatient confidentiality\nDifferent levels of \npriority alerts\nQuestions patient (condition specific)\nReminds patient to take medication\nPatient\nMobile \nPhone\nPC\nAlerts HP of \nnew data\nView alert\nAlerts HP of \nnew data\nView alert\n(C)\nThey can filter patient \nrecords based on \npriority\nThey can create triggers \non patient records\nSpecify delivery method \nof alert (Email\/SMS)\n(C)\nTo access data\n(A)\nInformation sent back to \nTelehealth monitor\nBlackberry\/\nMobile Phone\nTelehealth \nMonitor \n(type 2)\n* Results sent via one of the following methods \ndepending on the device.\nB: Bluetooth\nC: Cabled\nIR: Infrared\nResults*\nResults*\nResults*\nResults sent \nsecurely via \nSSL\nInformation sent back to \nBlackberry\/Mobile Phone\nWeb \nservices\nSSL = Secure Sockets Layer \n\u2013 It provides security on data \ntransferred over the internet\nResults \nsent\nInformation sent \nback to \nTelehealth \nmonitor (s)\nTelehealth \nMonitor \n(type 1B)\nResults*\nResults*\nResults*\n(B)\n(B)\nResponse to questions\n(B)\n(B)\nEPR\nInformation displayed to patient\nFigure 2 \u2013 Offering B representing a telehealth system for monitoring several chronic conditions \n \n1.3 Offering C \nOffering C (Figure 3) represents a system comprising health management tools for four \ndifferent conditions, namely diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma and COPD. The following \npoint-of-care devices can be used in the system: glucometer, BP monitor, peak flow meter \nand pulse oximeter. \nThe process begins with patients carrying out their test and manually entering results from \ntheir point-of-care device into a mobile phone preinstalled with the unique software for this \ntask. Other parameters required to accompany the results are information relating to diet or \nmedication and these are displayed on the mobile phone. Data are transmitted to a secure \nweb page which is accessible to health professionals (specialist nurses and GPs). They \nreview and analyse the data before its interpretation is sent back to the patient via their \nphone. The results on the phone are colour coded to ease interpretation of the information. \nThe web page is also available to patients.

The offering consists of three sub-sections classified based on the physical location \nof the entities.  \nSection 1 describes the service provided to patients when they are at home. The process is \ninitiated by the patient, who can use five different types of point-of-care devices: 12 lead \npersonal ECG monitor, weighing scale, BP monitor, all-in-one monitor (which measured \npulse, blood pressure, breathing rate, temperature, heart rate, heart rhythm, ECG and blood \noxygen level), and a \u201cMiniClinic\u201d (which helps to detect irregular\/abnormal heartbeat). \nResults from all the devices apart from the personal ECG monitor are sent via a gateway, an \nintermediate device that transfers results via a telephone line to the monitoring call centre. \nThe monitoring call centre is staffed by dedicated experts (cardiac nurses, cardiology \nregistrars) who evaluate the results and provide its interpretation via the phone to the \npatient. \nSection 2 describes how patients can transmit their results to the monitoring call centre if \nthey are not at home. Only results from the \u201cMiniClinic\u201d can be transferred because it has \nstorage facilities for five readings thus allowing data to be transferred via a USB MiniGate \nconnected to a PC.  \nSection 3 describes the service provided to GPs who use the professional version of the ECG \ndevice. The process here is initiated by the GP carrying out the test on the patient. The \ndevice then transmits data through a landline telephone to the monitoring call centre, \nwhere experts evaluate the results and provide an initial explanation verbally. A detailed \nreport is sent later by email or fax to the GP.  \n \nECG \nMonitor\nHealth \nProfessionals \n(HP)\nPatient\nAt GP Surgery\nData transferred\nExperts give full feedback to GP by email\/fax\nGP takes decision concerning patient \nand informs them\nAt Home Personal \nECG \nmonitor\nECG results transferred\nAll-in-one \nmonitor\nWeighing \nScale\nuses\nResults \nsent \nwirelessly  \nResults \ntransferred\nuses\nuses\nuses\nuses\nMiniClinic\nMiniClinic (wristwatch lookalike) detects \narrhythmia (irregular\/abnormal) heartbeat.\n5 data readings can be stored on the device\nAlso measures pulse, breathing rate and \ntemperature \nMiniClinic\nAnalyse and \ninterpret \nresults\nResults \ntransferred\nInterpretation of results\nResults \nsaved\nPCResults sent\nResults transferred\nInterpreted results sent\nPatient\nGP\nResults transferred\nData transferred\nData transferred\nVisits GP\nEnvironment \naway from home\nAll-in-one Device\nMeasures pulse, blood pressure, breathing rate, \ntemperature, heart rate, heart rhythm, ECG and \nblood oxygen level\nTelephoneGateway\nUSB \nMiniGate\nGateway\nTelephone\nBP \nMonitor\nuses\nInterpreted results sent back and explained to GP\nSection 1\nSection 3\nSection 2\nMonitoring Call \nCentre\nPC\nAccess to \nresults\nInformed when patient results are sent\nAlerted if patient results are outside\n        predefined thresholds\nFigure 4 \u2013 Offering D representing a telehealth system for monitoring cardiac and respiratory conditions  \n \n1.5 Offering E \nOffering E (Figure 5) represents a telehealth system for managing and preventing long term \nconditions such as CHF, COPD and asthma.  \nThe process begins with the patient using a vital signs monitor. The results are entered into \nany of the following three intermediate devices: PC, personal telehealth hub (similar to a \npersonal digital assistant) or mobile phone. The personal telehealth hub is linked to the \nserver through a telephone line. It has the capability to be personalised for each condition \nthat is being monitored by asking the patient symptomatic questions. It also retrieves \nmessages sent by the health professional. The results are transferred into a secure server \nwhich is accessible through a web browser to health professionals who analyse results and \nmonitor trends before sending a message to the patient via the personal telehealth hub. \nPatients have access to the results. Alerts are sent to health professionals if the patient\u2019s \nresults are unusual. This is either through an email or via SMS. GPs (primary) and specialists \n(secondary) health professionals can consult each other through the telehealth system to \ndiscuss the patient\u2019s progress.  \n \nPersonal \ntelehealth \nhub\nWeb \ninterface?\nCompany E \nserver (secure)\nVital Signs \nMonitor\nuses Results\nResults\nResults\nPresents \nrelevant data\nReview patient\u2019s \nresults\nPatient\nHealth \nProfessionals \n(HP)\nAccess to server\nSecondary HP \n(Specialist)\nPC\nMobile \nPhoneGathers patient's response to questions\n4 week trend of results can be accessed\nPC\nAccess to interface\nMessage from health professional\nAsks symptomatic \/ quality of life questions\nConfer with primary care HP regarding \npatient\u2019s health\nResults \nsent via \nthe \ntelephone \nline or via \nGPRS  \nMobile \nPhone\nDisplays \nalert\nViews patient data through web browser\nSend message to patient to visit GP or change medication\nCustomise questions to assess patient\u2019s condition\nAlerted if patient's \nresults are unusual\nMessage to from health professional\n \nFigure 5 \u2013 Offering E representing a telehealth system for managing and preventing long term conditions \n \n1.6 Offering F \nOffering F (Figure 6) represents a system for monitoring patients with the following chronic \nconditions: asthma, CHF, COPD, diabetes and hypertension. The system can also monitor \npatients who have depression, drug and alcohol addiction, are obese, are stopping smoking \nand have had a stroke. The process begins with the patient using either of five different \ntypes of point-of-care devices which included weighing scale, BP monitor, glucometer, peak \nflow meter and pulse oximeter. Results are sent to a telehealth hub before being sent on to \na server. Results are accessible to health professionals in order to assess the patient\u2019s \nhealth, and compliance with current medication regimes etc. They are also accessible to \ncaregivers. Health professionals can set up alerts to be triggered by unusual results entered \nby patients. They can also configure the hub with personalised questionnaires. The hub \nrecords the patient\u2019s response as well as delivering other messages which the health \nprofessional may have sent.

During the health session, the patient can watch informative \nvideos about their condition. The patient can use five different types of point-of-care \ndevices which included BP monitor, glucometer, pulse oximeter, peak flow meter and \nweighing scale. The sessions allow patients to measure vital signs, respond to questions to \nhelp assess their health, receive useful information and complete surveys. The intermediate \ndevice has audio and video capabilities to enable visual interaction with the health \nprofessional. Results from the point-of-care devices are sent to the intermediate device \ninitially before they are encrypted and sent to a remote database. At the end of the health \nsession, data are accessed by authorised health professionals from the database via a health \ncare management suite (a web interface). The health care management suite enables health \nprofessionals to modify the patient\u2019s medication or health routine. It also sends alerts, \npresented in a triage format, to health professionals when the patient\u2019s results are extreme. \nHealth professionals can confer with each other based on information obtained during \nhealth sessions. Messages can be sent to the patient via the intermediate device.

The EPR can be configured \nto deal with different chronic diseases and enables health professionals to set up a specific \ncare plan for patients to monitor their own condition The EPR allows the creation of reports \nfrom the data collected and it also alerts the health professional of any unusual results. \nCaregivers are provided access to patient responses from questionnaires through the home \nhub. \n \n \nPatient\nHome hub\nResults sent\nPulse \nOximeter\nWeighing \nScale\nGlucometer\nECG \nMonitor\nBP \nMonitoruses\nuses\nuses\nuses\nuses\nResults sent\nResults \nsent\nResults sent\nResults sent\nResults sent\nPresents questionnaire to patient\nSends medication reminders\nAnswers to questionnaires sent back Carers\nHave access \nto questionnaire data\nRemote \nMonitoring \nStation\nLogs information into patient \nrecord\nRequests information \nfrom contact centre?\nHealth \nProfessionals \n(HP)\nEPR\nRecords all data from the home hub\nStores protocols used to manage patient data\nInformation requested and \ncollected at regular intervals\nRequest questionnaire \ndata completed by patient\nPC\nAccess to \ndata\nSets up plan for \nmonitoring condition\nCreates reports of data collected\nSets alerts\nGets relevant information on patient\nEPR\n \nFigure 11 \u2013 Offering K representing a telehealth system for monitoring several chronic conditions \n \n1.12 Offering L \nOffering L (Figure 12) represents a system for monitoring patients with several chronic \nconditions namely chronic heart failure, diabetes and COPD.  \nThe process begins with the patient using one of the following point-of-care devices: \nweighing scale, BP monitor, pulse oximeter or glucometer. The results are sent to a set top \nbox wirelessly via Bluetooth for the weighing scale and BP monitor; and via a USB cable for \nthe glucometer. Results from the pulse oximeter and the patient\u2019s responses to health \nassessment questions are manually entered through a TV channel. From the set top box, the \nresults are forwarded via broadband to a secure server. Results are accessible to authorized \nhealth professionals via a web interface. In addition to reviewing results, health \nprofessionals can create and modify the patient\u2019s care plan based on their progress. This \ncare plan includes questionnaires which are configured by the health professionals and \ncustomized to each patient. Health professionals are alerted when patient\u2019s results do not \nfall within the specified thresholds and a follow-up questionnaire is sent to the patient to \nconfirm their results. \nUsing the television and a remote control, the patient can access their results, presented in \na graphical format, to compare it with targets set by the health professional. They can also \nwatch educational videos and receive messages from their health professional which may \ninclude reminders to take their medication.  \n \nTelevision\nWeb portal\nSecure server\nPulse \nOximeter\nBP \nMonitor\nWeighing \nScales\nGlucometer\nuses\nuses\nuses\nuses\nResults sent via Bluetooth\nData sent via \nbroadband \nthrough a \nmodem\nPatient\nResults from pulse oximeter are manually entered via a TV channel\nViews results in a graphical format\nSends response to questionnaires\nPrompts patient to respond to health assessment questions\nHealth \nProfessionals \n(HP)\nSecondary HP \n(Specialist)\nResults sent via \nBluetooth\nResults sent via \na USB cable\nFollow-up survey questions sent when thresholds exceeded\nPC\nAccess to data\nPatient\u2019s data is updated\nData is accessed through web interface by authorised HP\nData sent \nvia cable\nSet Top \nbox\nDiscuss patient's results\nSends alert if extreme results are obtained\nAccess to information is password-protected \n        with varying levels of authorization\nReview patient's results\nCustomize care plan for the patient\nMonitor trends in results\nReads results\n \nFigure 12 \u2013 Offering L representing a telehealth system for monitoring several chronic conditions \n \n2 Figure Legends \nFigure 1 \u2013 Offering A representing a telehealth system for diabetes management \nFigure 2 \u2013 Offering B representing a telehealth system for monitoring several chronic \nconditions \nFigure 3 \u2013 Offering C representing a telehealth system for monitoring several chronic \nconditions \nFigure 4 \u2013 Offering D representing a telehealth system for monitoring cardiac and \nrespiratory conditions \nFigure 5 \u2013 Offering E representing a telehealth system for managing and preventing long \nterm conditions \nFigure 6 \u2013 Offering F representing a telehealth system for monitoring several chronic \nconditions \nFigure 7 \u2013 Offering G representing a telehealth system for monitoring several chronic \nconditions \nFigure 8 \u2013 Offering H representing a telehealth system for monitoring several chronic \nconditions \nFigure 9 \u2013 Offering I representing a telehealth system for monitoring several chronic \nconditions \nFigure 10 \u2013 Offering J representing a telehealth system for monitoring several chronic \nconditions \nFigure 11 \u2013 Offering K representing a telehealth system for monitoring several chronic \nconditions \nFigure 12 \u2013 Offering L representing a telehealth system for monitoring several chronic \nconditions \n \n"}
