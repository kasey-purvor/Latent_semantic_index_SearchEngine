Introduction\nPeriodic pattern formation occurs at various stages and\nlocations during development. Formation of periodic\nstructure can be seen in skin pigment pattern (Bard,\n1981; Kondo and Asai, 1995), feather follicle formation\n(Jung et al., 1998), digit formation during development\n(Newman and Frisch, 1979; Miura and Shiota, 2000b) and\nso forth. These patterns cannot simply be explained by\npositional information theory and some developmental\nbiologists are beginning to utilize the Turing reaction\u2013\ndiffusion model (Turing, 1952) to understand the mechan-e front matter r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Maini).ism of biological pattern formation (Gilbert, 2004;\nWolpert, 1998).\nOne of the most extensively studied periodic patterning\nsystems is digit formation during limb development (Maini\nand Solursh, 1991). In 1979 it was postulated that a\nTuring-type reaction\u2013diffusion system could account for\nlimb pattern formation, and the model reproduced the\nincrease in the number of chondrogenic loci in the distal\npart of the limb bud (Newman and Frisch, 1979; see also\nOthmer, 1986; Newman et al., 1988). The Turing reac-\ntion\u2013diffusion model is one of the class of activator\u2013inhi-\nbitor models (Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972) and in fact\ngives patterns very similar to the later proposed mechan-\nochemical models of Oster and Murray (Oster et al., 1983).\nThis work has been neglected by developmental biologists\nsince molecular biology became the predominant ap-\nproach, but has remained influential in the field of\nmathematical biology (Murray, 2003). In 1993 it was\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 1. (a) Conventional view of digit formation as a self-organizing phenomenon. In this model, pattern formation only occurs at the distalmost part of\nthe limb bud and its trace is left proximally as the bud grows outwards. As a result, chondrogenic pattern (blue) is assumed to correspond to the time\ncourse of a one-dimensional reaction\u2013diffusion model on a growing domain. (b) Reproduction of Dbf phenotype with this model. Appearance of\nsupernumerary digits is observed by increasing growth speed.\nT. Miura et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 240 (2006) 562\u2013573 563shown that digit formation occurs even in the absence of\nproper Hox code specification (Ros et al., 1994). This\nobservation revitalized research on pattern formation\nduring limb development, and several relevant experiments\nhave recently been carried out in vitro (Miura and Shiota,\n2000a, b; Moftah et al., 2002). Recent findings on digit\nformation in the absence of proper Shh signalling and\nsubsequent Hox genes (Niederreither et al., 2002) further\nsupport the idea of self-organized periodic pattern forma-\ntion during limb development. Current conventional\nmodels hypothesize that periodic pattern formation occurs\nin the distal part of the autopod and leaves traces of the\npattern proximally (Hentschel et al., 2004; Chaturvedi\net al., 2005); since the autopod is flattened, the pattern can\nbe correlated with the one-dimensional reaction\u2013diffusion\nmodel on a growing domain (Fig. 1a).\nAn example supporting the existence of such a periodic\npattern formation mechanism in limb development is\nprovided by polydactylous mutant mice, in which super-\nnumerary digits are formed. For example, the polydacty-\nlous mutant mouse Doublefoot (Dbf) has six to eight\nsupernumerary digits without clear identity; in some cases\ndigits arise abruptly from interdigital connective tissue or\none digit splits into two distally (Hayes et al., 1998b).\nMorphologically the autopod is 2\u20132.5 times the width of\nthe wrist in the Doublefoot mutant, in contrast to 1.5 times\nin the wild-type autopod. Overexpansion of the digital\nplate is associated with ectopic Indian hedgehog (Ihh)\nexpression (Yang et al., 1998) and subsequent acceleration\nof cell proliferation (Crick et al., 2003). Ectopic Ihh\nexpression is first seen at E10.25 (Crick et al., 2003), by\nwhich time the proximal elements have been specified andexcessive cell proliferation affects only the carpal\/tarsal and\ndigital elements. Therefore we only consider the autopod\nregion of the limb in the simulation. If we increase the\ndomain growth speed at the distal part, the pattern shows\nadditional bifurcation or insertion of digits, which mimics\nthe digit phenotype of the Dbf mutant (Fig. 1b).\nIn the present study, we further investigated the model\nand the Dbf mutant phenotype and found convincing\nevidence that a one-dimensional Turing reaction\u2013diffusion\nmodel on a growing domain is applicable during limb\ndevelopment. Firstly, we show that in Dbf mutant limbs,\nextremely thin digits are sometimes present in the proximal\npart of the metacarpus\/metatarsus, which discontinuously\nbecome normal thickness digits more distally. Next we\nshow, by numerical simulations, that this complex mixed\nmode pattern can be generated by the simplest possible\nTuring reaction\u2013diffusion system under certain conditions.\nThen we analytically obtain plausible conditions for mixed\nmode pattern using matched asymptotics. Next we provide\na descriptive explanation of why the mixed mode pattern\noccurs under certain conditions using the nullclines of the\nactivator kinetics. We then go back to numerical calcula-\ntions to test the validity of our analytical prediction, and\nfinally show some relevant experimental observations\nwhich support the model and discuss possible experimental\napplications of the model.\n2. Experimental observation: appearance of thin digits in\nDbf mutant mice\nDbf mutant limbs have six to eight digits, and among\nthem we found that there sometimes exist thin digits at\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 2.

(c) Numbering system for the location of the thin digit.\nThe anteriormost digit was assigned the value 0 and posteriormost digit was assigned the value 1.

They\nwere observed in both the fore- and hindlimb, the hindlimb\nshowing a slightly higher frequency (forelimb 22\/72,\nhindlimb 28\/72). In some hindlimbs (but not forelimbs),\nmultiple thin digits were observed. Thin skeletal elements\nwere strictly confined to the autopod, never being observed\nin the proximal parts (zeugopod, stylopod) of the limb.\nThey were most frequently observed in the anteriormost\npart of the limb but were not confined to that region. To\nshow this, we introduced a numbering system in which the\nanteriormost digit was assigned the number 0 and the\nposteriormost digit was assigned the number 1, and\nexamined the distribution of the location of thin digits\n(Fig. 2c, d). From this analysis we found that thin digits\noccurred most frequently in the anteriormost part of\nthe limb. We observed another hot spot of thin\ndigits around location 0.5\u20130.8, indicating that in other\ncases these digits are likely to appear in the posterior half of\nthe limb.\nIn some cases (4\/144) including both fore- and\nhindlimbs, the thin digit abruptly attains normal thickness\ndistally (Fig. 2a, circle).\n3. Model definition\nWe consider the simplest possible form of the Turing\nreaction\u2013diffusion model which exhibits pattern formation.The system is defined as follows:\nqu\nqt\n\u00bc f \u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe \u00012g\u00011Du,\nqv\nqt\n\u00bc g\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe g\u00011Dv, \u00f01\u00de\nwhere\nf \u00f0u; v\u00de \u00bc\n\u0001f uu\u00fe f vv\u0001 2f u \u00f0uo\u0001 1\u00de;\nf uu\u00fe f vv \u00f0\u00011pup1\u00de;\n\u0001f uu\u00fe f vv\u00fe 2f u \u00f01ou\u00de;\n8><\n>>: \u00f02\u00de\ng\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00bc guu\u00fe gvv. \u00f03\u00de\nWe choose this piecewise linear model because it is one of\nthe simplest possible models which contains the minimal\nessential factors for diffusion driven instability. It simply\ndescribes the interaction of u and v in linear terms and\navoids blow-up of u by adding saturation kinetics when u\nexceeds a certain threshold. This model is qualitatively\nsimilar to the FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo type equations (Murray,\n2003), but one advantage of this model is that we can easily\nobtain approximate analytical solutions using matched\nasymptotics (described in Section 6.1). Numerical simula-\ntion results of the FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo model are qualita-\ntively similar to those presented here (data not shown).\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 3.

We\nstandardize the system so that u \u00bc v \u00bc 0 is an equilibrium\npoint. The activator reaction term f \u00f0u; v\u00de consists of three\nlinear functions. The second function represents the\ninteraction around the initial (u small) state. The first and\nthird functions represent the interaction after saturation\/\ndepletion of u. The inhibitor reaction term g\u00f0u; v\u00de consists\nof a simple linear function. f u; f v; gu; gv are constants and\nf u40; f vo0; gu40; gvo0. g is a scaling parameter which\ncan capture the domain growth and will increase with time.\nWe use linear growth and assume that the growth process\nis slow so that the observed pattern is a quasi-steady state.\n\u00012 represents the ratio between activator and inhibitor\ndiffusion coefficient and is less than 1 to satisfy diffusion\ndriven instability conditions (Murray, 2003).\n4. Numerical experiment: thin-digit-like structure appears in\nsome of the reaction\u2013diffusion models on a growing domain\nWhen the numerical calculation of the Turing reaction\u2013\ndiffusion system on a growing domain was undertaken and\nthe distribution of activator molecule visualized, for someparameter sets the pattern showed a stable thin-digit-like\npattern naturally. The thin-digit-like pattern is only seen in\nu distribution and we could not detect any mixed mode\npattern in the distribution of v (data not shown). The\npattern was not a transient pattern during peak splitting\nsince peak splitting itself was a rather rapid process and\nthe thin-digit-like pattern persisted much longer than the\nactual splitting process. In most parameter ranges the thin-\ndigit-like pattern was not detected (Fig. 3a, c, e). In some\ncases, the pattern was at first a simple sine wave-like\npattern but gradually evolved to a thin-digit-like pattern\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nT. Miura et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 240 (2006) 562\u2013573566(Fig. 3b, d, f). We could even detect the appearance\nof normal digits from thin digits in some cases, which\nfaithfully mimics the example illustrated in Fig. 2a (Fig. 3b,\narrowhead). The abrupt appearance of normal-size digits\nwas analysed previously (Crampin et al., 2002a) and is a\nseparate problem, so we concentrate below on the\nappearance of mixed mode patterns.\nTo confirm whether the thin-digit-like pattern is\nobserved only on a growing domain, we determined 100\nrandom linear parameter sets \u00f0f u; f v; gu; gv; du; dv\u00de which\nsatisfy diffusion-driven instability conditions, and under-\ntook numerical calculation to see whether they produce\nnormal sine wave-like patterns or thin-digit-like patterns in\nfixed domains and in growing domains. In the fixed domain\nsimulations only 1 out of 100 systems showed thin-digit-\nlike pattern while in the growing domains about half of the\npatterns were of mixed mode type (Table 1). From this\nresult we conclude that domain growth facilitates forma-\ntion of a thin-digit-like pattern.\n5. Comparison of experimental observation and theoretical\nresults\nComparing the experimental and simulation results we\nsee excellent agreement between the thin-digit-like pattern\nsometimes observed in Doublefoot mutant limbs, and those\npredicted by the Turing reaction\u2013diffusion model under\ncertain conditions. It is difficult to explain this complex\npattern change simply by a one-by-one specification with\npositional information. The molecular cascade which leads\nto the Doublefoot mutant is well studied, so we are now\nmotivated to determine the conditions under which thin-\ndigit-like patterns are generated in the Turing reaction\u2013\ndiffusion model, since this may be correlated to the\ndifferences in the molecular cascade occurring in Double-\nfoot mutant limbs when compared to the wild type limb.\nFrom here on we use the term \u2018\u2018mixed mode\u2019\u2019 to describe\nthis thin-digit-like morphology. \u2018\u2018Mode\u2019\u2019 in this context\nrepresents a wavenumber component in the frequency\ndomain and in this pattern one mode (normal thickness\ndigit) coexists with a different mode (thin digit). This is\ndifferent from the phenomenon of \u2018\u2018mode doubling\u2019\u2019\ndescribed by Crampin et al. (2002a)\u2014we use \u2018\u2018mixed\nmode\u2019\u2019 as a description of a patterned final steady state\nwhile \u2018\u2018mode doubling\u2019\u2019 is a description of a dynamic\ntransient process during domain growth.\n6. Analytical derivation of the condition for mixed mode\npattern in Turing reaction\u2013diffusion model\n6.1. Obtaining approximate solutions with a piecewise linear\nmodel\nTo understand the results of the numerical calculations\ndescribed above, we undertook a matched asymptotics\napproach to obtain approximate analytical solutions in the\nlimit of low du=dv ratio. An overview of the procedure is asfollows: at first we assume a specific solution form, which is\nnot a general form but is later confirmed by numerical\ncalculation. Then we construct two solutions, inner and\nouter, which represent rapidly changing and slowly\nchanging solution parts, respectively, and combine them\nto obtain an approximate solution (Crampin et al., 2002a).\nWe suppose \u000151, and consider a plateau-like form\nsolution of u in which there are alternating \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 states interspersed with transition layers. v should be\na smoother simple harmonic wave-like solution because of\nits high diffusion coefficient. We scale the system so that it\ncontains the span from the centre of the peak to the centre\nof the neighbouring valley between 0oxo1. Next, we\nseparately obtain inner and outer solutions, which hold\nnear and far from the transition layer, then match these\nsolutions between separate regions of the piecewise linear\nfunction (3). We simplify the analysis by only considering a\nsystem which has reverse symmetry, i.e. the system does\nnot change qualitatively under the \u00f0u; v\u00de ! \u00f0\u0001u;\u0001v\u00de\ntransformation. In this case the location of the transition\nlayer should be x \u00bc 1\n2\nand after several approximations\n(following the method in Crampin et al., 2002b), the\nsolution obtained between 0oxo 1\n2\nis\nu\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc 2e\nffiffiffiffiffi\nf ug\np\n\u00f0x\u00011=2\u00de=\u0001 \u00fe 2f ugv\np\n\u00fe 2f vgu sech\u00f0\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\npg=2f u\np\n\u00de cosh\u00f0\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\u00f0pg=f u\u00de\np\nx\u00de\np\n, \u00f04\u00de\nv\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc 2f ugu\np\ncosh\nffiffiffiffiffi\npg\nf u\nr\nx\n\u0002 \u0003\nsech\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\npg\n2f u\nr\u0002 \u0003\n\u0001 1\n\u0002 \u0003\n, \u00f05\u00de\nwhere p \u00bc \u0001\u00f0f ugv \u00fe f vgu\u00de40. Details of the analysis are\ndescribed in Appendix C.\nNext, we look for the term which contributes to this\nmixed mode pattern. The first two terms of (4) come from\nthe inner solution and the third term is the contribution of\nthe outer solution. The first term of (4) is an increasing\nfunction of x and the second term is constant. Since p40\nand 2f vgu sech\u00f0\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\npg=2f u\np\n\u00deo0, the third term of (4) is a\ndecreasing function in x40. This term should be a\ndecreasing function in order to generate mixed mode\npattern, so this term is responsible for the formation of\nmixed mode pattern.\n6.2. Intuitive explanation of the mixed-mode pattern\nThe mixed-mode pattern comes from the contribution of\nthe outer solution, which can be understood by comparing\nthe spatial distribution of \u00f0u; v\u00de (Fig. 4a) and the u nullcline\n(Fig. 4b). In the outer solution, \u00012Du is small, so u and v\nsatisfy f \u00f0u; v\u00de \u00bc 0, and \u00f0u; v\u00de should be on the u nullcline\n(Fig. 4b). Consider a point a, which lies between 0oxo 12.\nThen u and v at that point should both be negative. Then\nconsider the \u00f0u; v\u00de value of point b, which lies slightly to the\nright of point a (i.e., slightly larger x) and in 0oxo 1\n2\n, in\nFig. 4a. v should increase by this move since the\ndistribution of v is monotonically increasing. Then, u must\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nT. Miura et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 240 (2006) 562\u2013573 567decrease because \u00f0u; v\u00de should be on the u nullcline\n(Fig. 4b). This means that in the outer solution u should\ndecrease as we get close to the transition layer, which\nresults in mixed-mode pattern. Therefore, the upper and\nlower limits of the activator concentration should result in\nthis type of mixed-mode pattern. This is counteracted by\nthe contribution of the inner solution, so this pattern\nshould be more prominent when \u0001 is small. When g is large,Fig. 4. Intuitive explanation of the emergence of mixed-mode pattern.\nAway from the transition layer, the solution should be on the curve\nf \u00f0u; v\u00de \u00bc 0, i.e. on the u nullcline. Since the system is saturated the solution\nshould be on the two lateral branches. Consider the \u00f0u; v\u00de value at points a\nand b on the nullcline. Since the diffusion coefficient of v is large, v should\nmonotonously increase as x increases. Since the solution should be on the\nnullcline, u has to decrease as x increases, resulting in mixed-mode pattern.\nFig. 5. (a) Comparison of analytical and numerical solutions.

The importance of the first condition in Section 6.3\n(large g) has already been mentioned (see Table 1). To see\nwhether the mixed-mode pattern is likely to be generated\nwith the small \u0001 condition as predicted in the second\ncondition, we generated 100 Turing reaction\u2013diffusion\nsystems randomly, and divided them into two groups\u2014\nsystems that show mixed-mode pattern and systems that do\nnot.

Saturation kinetics of the reaction\u2013diffusion model affects the appearance of mixed-mode pattern. If we change the gradient of the two saturation\nbranches of the u nullcline, we can modulate the appearance of mixed mode patterns as predicted from the intuitive explanation in Fig. 4.\nT. Miura et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 240 (2006) 562\u2013573568The average of \u00012 is smaller in the group that generates\nmixed-mode patterns (Fig. 5b). To further confirm this, we\nfocused on one specific reaction\u2013diffusion system and\nchanged \u00012. We can observe the appearance of mixed-mode\npattern as we decrease \u00012, which also confirms the above\nanalysis (Fig. 5c).\nNext we examined the third condition\u2014whether the\nsaturation kinetics of the activator reaction term affects the\nappearance of mixed-mode pattern. From the intuitive\nexplanation using nullclines (Fig. 4) we can predict that if\nwe change the saturated part of the activator kinetics and\nselect a gentler gradient in the nullcline, then the mixed-\nmode pattern will be more apparent.

Experimental observation: application of the mixed-mode\npattern analysis\nOne prediction from this model is that we can observe an\ninverse pattern\u2014reduced differentiation within thick di-\ngits\u2014since the saturation of activator kinetics should occur\nat both upper and lower limits. We found such an example\nin actual Dbf mutant limbs (Fig. 7). The example illustrated\nshows a thin undifferentiated area in the middle of the\nthick digit; the proximal aspect of the digit is of normal\nthickness, which rules out the possibility that the pattern is\ngenerated by fusion of two preexisting digits. This pattern\nagain is very difficult to explain simply by regional\nspecification using positional information gradients, and\nit further validates the model used in this study.\nAnother prediction from this model is that since the\nassumption of the model is quite generic\u2014it only requires\nthe existence of saturation of activator kinetics\u2014this\npattern can be observed in other species. Close inspection\nof the literature reveals existence of numerous such \u2018\u2018thin-\ndigit\u2019\u2019 cases. In human polydactyly, thin-digit morphology\nis sometimes observed (Fig. 7c, arrow), which is frequently\ndescribed as \u2018\u2018rudimentary\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018hypoplastic\u2019\u2019. In some\ncases, these supernumerary digits are only thin proximally\n(Fig. 7c, arrowhead), and the original description runs as\nfollows: \u2018\u2018the extra toe consisted of a thin metatarsal, a\nthicker and better formed proximal phalanx, and a broad\ndistal phalanx\u2019\u2019 (Temtamy and McKusick, 1978). Another\nexample of the thin-digit phenotype is Daubentonia\nmadagascariensis\u2014a primate generally called aye-aye, in\nwhich a thin, elongated middle digit is used to pick out\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 7.

Discussion\nOne advantage of using the simplest possible model for\nspatial pattern generation is that the result can be applied\nto a wide class of models which have the same property.\nThe property we use is (a) diffusion-driven instability,\nwhich many mathematical models that generate periodic\nstructure utilize, and (b) saturation of activator kinetics,\nwhich is a very natural assumption since in physical\nsystems values never tend to infinity and the activator,\nwhich has positive feedback kinetics, should be the first\nfactor to saturate. Most reaction\u2013diffusion models have\nthese properties and hence have an ability to generate\nmixed-mode pattern.\nWe believe that mixed-mode patterns arise relatively\neasily in biological situations since they occur under\nnatural biological conditions. Existence of activator\nkinetics saturation is obvious as described in the previous\nparagraph. The small ratio of diffusion coefficients \u00f0\u00012\u00de is\nconsistent with the conditions for diffusion-driven instabil-\nity, so we will expect the mixed-mode pattern to be\nfrequently observed if periodic pattern is formed. Twoexamples of skin patterning illustrate this point. In fish skin\npigment pattern, where a reaction\u2013diffusion system has\nbeen proposed (Kondo and Asai, 1995), mixed-mode\npattern is sometimes present (S. Kondo, personal commu-\nnication). During the development of dermatoglyphics\n(fingerprint patterns), the epidermal ridges first show a\nsimple periodic structure (primary ridges), then later\nanother furrow is formed within the ridges (secondary\nridges), which can be regarded as a mixed-mode pattern\n(Shauman and Alter, 1976).\nWe have shown that many of the above experimental\nobservations are consistent with the Turing model.\nFurthermore, the model analysis we carried out allows us\nto make experimentally testable predictions. For example,\ncell culture systems of limb mesenchyme cells can\nreproduce periodic pattern formation in vitro (Miura and\nShiota, 2000a, b), and it may be possible to reproduce\ndomain growth by observing the edge of the cell colony\nsince the colony gradually grows without a barrier and the\nresulting chondrogenic loci show a radiating pattern.\nAnother tool is TGFb2, which is a very good candidate\nmolecule for the activator u (Miura and Shiota, 2000b). We\ncan predict that continuous addition of this molecule to the\nculture medium results in a change in saturation kinetics\nand hence a change in the appearance of small structures.\nThe above analysis also implies that Dbf mutant mice\nshould have lower activator diffusion coefficient in their\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nT. Miura et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 240 (2006) 562\u2013573570limbs, which might be experimentally testable utilizing\nfluorescently labelled TGFb2 (Miura and Shiota, 2002), or\nby monitoring whether Ihh can induce production of\ncertain extracellular matrix components by limb mesench-\nyme cells, which should modify the diffusion coefficient of\nthe activator molecule.\nIn our model we could not detect mixed-mode pattern in\ninhibitor distribution, but this is not true for all systems\nthat generate periodic pattern. For example, Hentschel et\nal. (2004) used a three-species model and observed mixed-\nmode pattern in both activator and inhibitor distribution.\nIn this case the model equations have nonlinearity in all\nthree species and should be considered separately from our\nanalysis. We should point out that with the present analysis\nwe cannot rule out a higher order mixed-mode contribu-\ntion to the inhibitor concentration, but our numerical\nsimulations suggest that it would be so small as to be\nbiologically irrelevant.\nSome recent studies indicate that transitions in pattern\ncomplexity are not solely generated by domain growth. For\nexample, Chaturvedi et al. (2005) argued that in chick,\nanteroposterior width remains constant during pattern\nformation. Mathematically, changing diffusion coefficient,\noverall speed of reaction term, or domain growth are all\nequivalent, so a combination of these factors may be\nworking in vivo. The mathematical analysis in this paper\ngives the qualitative result that mixed-mode pattern is more\nlikely to appear when the domain grows more, and this\nagrees well with the fact that Doublefoot mutant mice\nsometimes have thin digits.\nThere are several possible reasons why the thin digit\nabnormality is not observed between all the digits in the\nDoublefoot limb bud. One is the existence of noise in such a\nbiological system, which should be much larger than\nthermal noise in physical systems. Another factor is the\nfaster domain growth in the Doublefoot autopod. From\nnumerical simulations we have an impression that faster\ndomain growth results in uneven distribution of structure.\nThis may be because lower wavenumber components do\nnot have sufficient time to decay completely if the domain\ngrowth is fast and this results in regional differences.\nAnother regional difference we observed experimentally is\nthe high frequency of thin digits anteriorly (Fig. 2d), which\nmay be explained by more prolonged and hence greater\nexpansion in the anterior part, which can be seen in\nDoublefoot limb morphology (Hayes et al., 1998; Crick\net al., 2003).\nIt has been noticed that mixed-mode periodic patterns\ncan appear in reaction\u2013diffusion models on a growing\ndomain (E. Crampin, personal communication) but they\nhave not properly been described or analysed, because their\nbiological importance has not been recognized. This study\nis one example of how experimental data based on both\nmolecular and morphological observation drive numerical\nsimulation and mathematical analysis to gain insight into\nmechanisms of pattern formation and then provide\nevidence for the validity of the model used.Acknowledgements\nThe author is grateful for helpful discussions and\ncomments with Drs.

(29)\nThe resulting form of u\u00f0x\u00de is somewhat cumbersome, but\nif we neglect the inner solution in region 2 and consider the\nsolutions in regions 1 and 3 only, we do not change the\nmatching condition for the leading order calculation and\nretain good approximation to the numerical solution\n(Crampin et al., 2002a).\nFrom the condition ui3\u00f00\u00de \u00bc ui1\u00f00\u00de, we find that C1 \u00bc 2\nand then the resulting inner solution in terms of x is\nui1\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc \u00012\u00fe 2e\nffiffiffiffiffi\nf ug\np\n\u00f0x\u00011=2\u00de=\u0001. (30)\nui3 can be obtained by the reverse symmetry condition.\nui3 \u00bc \u0001ui1\u00f01\u0001 x\u00de. (31)\nC.4. Composite solution\nTo obtain the composite solution, we substitute the\nconstant term of the inner solution (30) into the outersolution (23) since the constant term is the value when the\ninner solution is away from the transition layer \u00f0x!1\u00de.\nThe resulting composite solution is shown in the main\ntext (4).References\nBard, J.B., 1981.
