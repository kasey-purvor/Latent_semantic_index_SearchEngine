The original motivation behind these spaces\nwas to produce a new example of a Banach sequence algebra with a bounded approximate\nidentity, in analogy with Andrew and Green\u2019s study of the James space as a Banach\nalgebra [3]. This idea turned out to be successful, as essentially all results about the James\nspace as a Banach algebra carry over to our new spaces; see [9] for details.\nHaving thus reached our initial goal, we soon realized that a serious problem was lurking\nin the background, namely: how can we distinguish the James\u2013Schreier spaces from the\nJames spaces? Obviously, if they were isomorphic, our findings would be of no interest. In\norder to resolve this problem, we turned to Banach-space properties and, as we shall see,\nat that level differences abound; this is the main theme of the present paper.\n1\nWe begin with surveys of the James spaces (Section 2) and the Schreier space (Sec-\ntion 3), where we introduce notation and explain ideas and properties which we shall\nsubsequently pursue in the case of the James\u2013Schreier spaces. In fact, as a spin-off of our\ninvestigation, we generalize the concept of a Schreier space from just one Schreier space\n(corresponding to the `1-norm) to a whole family, one for each p \u2208 [1,\u221e) (corresponding\nto the `p-norms). The basic theory of these spaces is developed in Section 3; our most\nimportant findings are: (i) the standard unit vector basis is a shrinking, 1-unconditional\nbasis for each Schreier space; (ii) those right-shifts which define bounded operators on the\nSchreier spaces can be characterized (see Corollary 3.17(ii) for details). The former of these\nresults leads to an explicit description of the biduals of the Schreier spaces, while the latter\nimplies that each Schreier space is isomorphic to its Cartesian square.\nSection 4 contains the definition of the James\u2013Schreier spaces, one for each p \u2208 [1,\u221e),\ntogether with an exposition of their basic theory. Results include: (i) the standard basis is\na monotone basis, shrinking for p > 1, but not unconditional (it will follow from results in\nSection 6 that no basis is); (ii) each James\u2013Schreier space contains a complemented copy of\nthe corresponding Schreier space; (iii) the standard right shift defines a bounded operator\non the James\u2013Schreier spaces only in the trivial cases, but a suitably modified version of\nit turns out to be bounded under conditions similar to those found for the Schreier spaces\n(see Propositions 4.18(ii) and 4.20).\nSections 5 and 6 contain our two main results: the James\u2013Schreier spaces are c0-satur-\nated (which means that each of their closed, infinite-dimensional subspaces contains a copy\nof c0), and they do not have Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski\u2019s property (u), so in particular they do not embed\nin a Banach space with an unconditional basis.\nAs a consequence of these results, we can complete the \u2018comparison theory\u2019 of our\nspaces: firstly, the James spaces are totally incomparable with both the Schreier and\nthe James\u2013Schreier spaces (which means that they have no closed, infinite-dimensional\nsubspaces in common), and secondly, no James\u2013Schreier space embeds in a Schreier space,\nwhereas each Schreier space embeds complementedly in a James\u2013Schreier space, as already\nmentioned in (ii) above.\nWe conclude this introduction with some general conventions on notation and termi-\nnology. Throughout, K denotes the scalar field; either K = R or K = C.\nBy an operator we understand a linear mapping between vector spaces. We write IX\nfor the identity operator on a vector space X. A functional is a linear mapping from a\nvector space to its scalar field. For a functional f on a vector space X and a vector x \u2208 X,\nwe usually write \u3008x, f\u3009 instead of f(x).\nLet X be a normed space. For a subset M of X, spanM denotes the linear span of M\nin X, while spanM is its closure. We write X \u2032 for the (continuous) dual of X, that is,\nX \u2032 consists of the bounded functionals on X. The canonical embedding of X into its\nbidual X \u2032\u2032 is denoted by \u03baX , or just \u03ba if reference to X is unnecessary. We say that two\nnormed spacesX and Y are isomorphic, writtenX \u223c= Y , if there is a linear homeomorphism\nfrom X onto Y .\nBy a basis for a Banach space X, we shall always understand a Schauder basis, that\n2\nis, a sequence (bn)n\u2208N in X such that, for each x \u2208 X, there is a unique sequence (\u03b1n)n\u2208N\nof scalars such that the series\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1 \u03b1nbn is norm-convergent with sum x. If this series\nconverges unconditionally for each x \u2208 X, then the basis (bn)n\u2208N is unconditional. A\nsequence (bn)n\u2208N in a Banach space is a basic sequence if (bn)n\u2208N is a basis for its closed\nlinear span, span {bn : n \u2208 N}.\nFor m \u2208 N, the mth biorthogonal functional b\u2032m associated with a basis (bn)n\u2208N for a\nBanach space X is given by \u3008x, b\u2032m\u3009 := \u03b1m for each x =\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1 \u03b1nbn \u2208 X. This is a bounded\nfunctional on X, and (b\u2032m)m\u2208N is a basic sequence in X \u2032. If (b\u2032m)m\u2208N is a basis for X \u2032 (that\nis, if span {b\u2032m : m \u2208 N} = X \u2032), then the basis (bn)n\u2208N is shrinking.\nWe denote by KN the vector space of all sequences over K; c00 is the subspace of KN of\nfinitely supported sequences. The vectors\nen := (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1\npos. n\n, 0, 0, . . .) (n \u2208 N) (1.1)\nform a Hamel basis for c00, called the standard unit vector basis. For m \u2208 N, the mth\ncoordinate functional is given by\nfm : (\u03b1n)n\u2208N 7\u2192 \u03b1m, KN \u2192 K, (1.2)\nand for a set A (usually a subset of N), the natural projection associated with A is the\noperator PA : KN \u2192 KN whose coordinates are given by\n\u3008PAx, fm\u3009 :=\n{\n\u3008x, fm\u3009 if m \u2208 A\n0 otherwise\n(m \u2208 N, x \u2208 KN). (1.3)\nThis is clearly an idempotent operator. In the special case where A = {1, 2, . . . ,m} for\nsome m \u2208 N, we write Pm instead of PA, that is,\nPm : (\u03b1n)n\u2208N 7\u2192 (\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1m, 0, 0, . . .), KN \u2192 c00; (1.4)\nwe call Pm the mth natural projection.\nFor a set A, we define \u03c7A \u2208 KN by\n\u3008\u03c7A, fm\u3009 =\n{\n1 if m \u2208 A\n0 otherwise\n(m \u2208 N);\nthe most important cases are\n\u03c7[n,n+k] =\nn+k\u2211\nj=n\nej \u2208 c00 (n, k \u2208 N) and \u03c7N = (1, 1, . . . , 1, 1, . . .). (1.5)\nGiven a set B, we write A b B to indicate that A is a finite subset of B. In the case\nwhere B is totally ordered (typically B = N), we write A = {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk} to\nsignify that {n1, n2, . . . , nk} is the increasing ordering of A.\nWe denote by cardA the cardinality of a set A. We shall not be concerned with the\nsubtleties of infinite cardinalities because we shall only consider cardinalities of subsets\nof N; hence we think of cardA as belonging to {0, 1, 2, . . . ,\u221e}.\n3\n2 James\u2019 quasi-reflexive Banach spaces\nThis section contains a brief survey of the James spaces and their most important prop-\nerties, with special emphasis on the Banach-algebraic aspects; no proofs will be given.\nHowever, at the end we shall outline James\u2019 original construction because our subsequent\nwork will involve key components of it. An elementary introduction to the James spaces\nis given in [30], while a much more comprehensive account can be found in [18]; both of\nthese references contain full proofs.\nThe original James space J2 was introduced by James in [22]. His main result states\nthat this Banach space is isomorphic to its bidual and quasi-reflexive (meaning that the\ncanonical image of J2 in its bidual has codimension 1). This resolved two major open\nproblems at the time:\n(i) A Banach space with separable bidual need not be reflexive.\n(ii) A separable Banach space which is isomorphic to its bidual need not be reflexive.\nIn a sequel [23], James defined an equivalent norm on J2 with respect to which the space\neven becomes isometrically isomorphic to its bidual.\nSubsequently, many other interesting properties of the James space have been added\nto James\u2019 list; we mention some of the most important here:\n(iii) Bessaga and Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski [8] observed that the quasi-reflexivity of J2 implies that\nJ2 6\u223c= J2 \u2295 J2, making J2 the first known example of an infinite-dimensional Banach\nspace which is not isomorphic to its Cartesian square.\n(iv) Herman and Whitley [21] proved that J2 is `2-saturated, that is, every closed, infinite-\ndimensional subspace of J2 contains a subspace X which is isomorphic to `2; Casazza,\nLin, and Lohman [14] subsequently showed that it is always possible to choose such\nan X with the additional property that X is complemented in J2.\n(v) Edelstein and Mityagin [17] calculated the homotopy type of the group of invertible\noperators on J2. As part of this calculation, they noted that the quasi-reflexivity of J2\nhas the easy, but algebraically very important, consequence that the ideal W (J2)\nof weakly compact operators has codimension 1 in the Banach algebra B(J2) of\nbounded operators on J2, so that there is a character on B(J2). No such examples\nwere previously known. Laustsen [25, 26] has subsequently shown that W (J2) is the\nunique maximal ideal in B(J2), while the scalar multiples of the character are the\nonly traces on B(J2).\n(vi) Giesy and James [20] have shown that c0 is finitely representable in J2, that is, for\neach \u03b5 > 0 and each n \u2208 N, there is an operator T : `n\u221e \u2192 J2 such that\n(1\u2212 \u03b5)\u2016x\u2016`n\u221e 6 \u2016Tx\u2016J2 6 (1 + \u03b5)\u2016x\u2016`n\u221e (x \u2208 `n\u221e).\nConsequently, J2 does not have finite coptype. In contrast, Pisier [33] has proved\nthat the dual J \u20322 has cotype 2 and, moreover, that J2 has the Gordon\u2013Lewis property\n(which means that every 1-summing operator from J2 to an arbitrary Banach space\nfactors through L1).\n4\n(vii) Casazza [13] has shown that J2 is primary, that is, X \u223c= J2 or Y \u223c= J2 whenever X\nand Y are closed, complementary subspaces of J2.\n(viii) Andrew and Green [3] have shown that J2 is a Banach algebra with respect to the\npointwise product. Further, this Banach algebra is Arens regular, and its multiplier\nalgebra can be identified with J \u2032\u20322 with the Arens product.\n(ix) Loy and Willis [29] have constructed a bounded right approximate identity in the\nideal W (J2) of weakly compact operators on J2. This allowed them to deduce that\nderivations from B(J2) are automatically continuous. Willis [35] has subsequently\ngeneralized this result by showing that homomorphisms fromB(J2) are automatically\ncontinuous.\n(x) Odell and Tylli [31] completed Loy and Willis\u2019 work on bounded approximate iden-\ntities in W (J2) by showing that W (J2) also has a bounded left approximate identity\nand hence a bounded two-sided approximate identity.\n(xi) Laustsen [24] has calculated the K-groups of the Banach algebra B(J2).\n(xii) Blanco [11] has proved that the ideal K (J2) of compact operators on J2 is weakly\namenable. It is an open problem if K (J2) is amenable; Blanco and Gr\u00f8nb\u00e6k [12]\nhave recently shown that K (J2 \u2295 J \u20322) fails to be amenable.\nWe shall now take a closer look at the formal definition of the James space and the\nstrategy which James followed when he proved that it is quasi-reflexive.\n2.1 The James spaces. Let 1 6 p <\u221e. For x = (\u03b1n)n\u2208N \u2208 KN and A b N, define\n\u03bdp(x,A) :=\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n0 when cardA 6 1;( k\u2211\nj=1\n|\u03b1nj \u2212 \u03b1nj+1 |p\n) 1\np\nwhen A = {n1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk+1} for some k \u2208 N.\nUsing Minkowski\u2019s inequality, one can easily check that \u03bdp( \u00b7 , A) is a seminorm on KN for\neach A b N, and\n\u2016x\u2016Jp := sup\n{\n\u03bdp(x,A) : A b N\n}\n= sup\n{( k\u2211\nj=1\n|\u03b1nj \u2212 \u03b1nj+1|p\n) 1\np\n: k, n1, . . . , nk+1 \u2208 N, n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk+1\n}\ndefines a complete norm on the subspace Jp :=\n{\nx \u2208 c0 : \u2016x\u2016Jp <\u221e\n}\nof KN. The Banach\nspace (Jp, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Jp) is called the pth James space.\n2.2 Remark. James\u2019 original definition corresponds to the case p = 2 above. Edelstein\nand Mityagin [17] appear to have been the first to observe that it can be generalized to\narbitrary p > 1 and, moreover, that James\u2019 proof of the quasi-reflexivity of J2 carries over\ndirectly to Jp for each p > 1. The proof does not, however, work for p = 1 because J1 is\nisometrically isomorphic to `1 via the mapping (\u03b1n)n\u2208N 7\u2192 (\u03b1n \u2212 \u03b1n+1)n\u2208N, J1 \u2192 `1.\n5\nMost of the results (iii)\u2013(xii) listed above have generalizations to Jp for p > 1. We state\nthe following generalization of (iv) explicitly for later reference.\n2.3 Proposition. Let p > 1. Then every closed, infinite-dimensional subspace of Jp\ncontains a subspace which is isomorphic to `p and complemented in Jp.\nThe key element in James\u2019 proof [22] that J2 is quasi-reflexive is the following explicit\ndescription of the bidual of a Banach space with a shrinking basis. We follow Megginson\u2019s\npresentation [30, Section 4.5].\n2.4 The James representation of the bidual of a Banach space with a shrinking\nbasis. For a Banach space X with a fixed basis (bn)n\u2208N, define\n\u2016x\u2016bip(X) := sup\n{\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 m\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b1nbn\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\nX\n: m \u2208 N\n} (\nx = (\u03b1n)n\u2208N \u2208 KN\n)\n. (2.1)\nThen bip(X) :=\n{\nx \u2208 KN : \u2016x\u2016bip(X) < \u221e\n}\nis a subspace of KN, and \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016bip(X) is a\ncomplete norm on it.\nNow suppose that the basis (bn)n\u2208N is shrinking. Then the operator \u03a5: X \u2032\u2032 \u2192 bip(X)\ngiven by \u03a5(F ) :=\n(\u3008b\u2032n, F \u3009)n\u2208N for each F \u2208 X \u2032\u2032 is an isomorphism which makes the\ndiagram\nX n\u000e\n\u03b9\n\u001d\u001d;\n;;\n;;\n;;\n;;\n;\n\u001f  \u03ba \/\/ X \u2032\u2032\n\u03a5\n\u223c=\n\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0002\n\u0002\u0002\n\u0002\u0002\n\u0002\u0002\n\u0002\u0002\nbip(X)\ncommutative, where \u03b9 is the operator x 7\u2192 (\u3008x, b\u2032n\u3009)n\u2208N, while \u03ba is the canonical embedding.\nThe isomorphism \u03a5 is isometric if the basis (bn)n\u2208N is monotone.\n2.5 Remark. There is no standard notation for the Banach space bip(X) considered\nin \u00a72.4; we have chosen the letters bip for \u2018bounded initial projections\u2019.\n2.6 The quasi-reflexivity of the James spaces. The starting point of the proof that\nJp is quasi-reflexive for each p > 1 is the observation that (en)n\u2208N is a monotone, shrinking\nbasis for Jp, so that the results of \u00a72.4 apply. One then checks that Jp and K\u03c7N are closed,\ncomplementary subspaces of bip(Jp), and we therefore have a commutative diagram\nJp\n_\n\u03b9\n\u000f\u000f\n\u001f  \u03ba \/\/ J \u2032\u2032p\n\u03a5\u223c=\n\u000f\u000f\nJp \u2295K\u03c7N bip(Jp),\nwhere \u03b9 is the natural inclusion, \u03ba is the canonical embedding, and \u03a5 is the isometric\nisomorphism from \u00a72.4. This shows immediately that \u03ba(Jp) has codimension 1 in J \u2032\u2032p and,\n6\nmoreover, if we identify J \u2032\u2032p with bip(Jp) via \u03a5, then \u03ba = \u03b9, that is, the canonical embedding\nof Jp into its bidual becomes the natural inclusion of Jp into Jp \u2295K\u03c7N.\n3 The Schreier spaces\nHaving proved that, for 1 < p <\u221e, each weakly convergent sequence (xn)n\u2208N in Lp[0, 1] has\na subsequence (xnj)j\u2208N whose associated sequence of arithmetic means,\n(\n1\nm\n\u2211m\nj=1 xnj\n)\nm\u2208N,\nis norm-convergent, Banach and Saks [5] went on to ask if a similar result would be true\nin C[0, 1]. Schreier [34] answered this question in the negative; his counterexample was\nbased on the following notion.\n3.1 Definition. A subset A of N is admissible if 1 6 cardA 6 minA.\nThus, an admissible set is non-empty and finite, and for A = {n1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk} b N, we\nhave\nA is admissible \u21d0\u21d2 k 6 n1.\nEach non-empty subset of an admissible set is itself admissible; we shall use this simple\nobservation frequently.\n3.2 The unrestricted Schreier spaces. Let 1 6 p < \u221e. For x = (\u03b1n)n\u2208N \u2208 KN and\nA \u2286 N, define \u00b5p(x,A) :=\n(\u2211\nn\u2208A |\u03b1n|p\n) 1\np . (Note: the sum over an empty index set is\nzero by convention.) Minkowski\u2019s inequality implies that \u00b5p( \u00b7 , A) is a seminorm on KN for\neach A b N, and\n\u2016x\u2016Zp := sup\n{\n\u00b5p(x,A) : A \u2286 N is admissible\n}\n= sup\n{( k\u2211\nj=1\n|\u03b1nj |p\n) 1\np\n: k, n1, . . . , nk \u2208 N, k 6 n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk\n}\nthen defines a norm on the subspace Zp :=\n{\nx \u2208 KN : \u2016x\u2016Zp < \u221e\n}\nof KN. We call \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Zp\nthe pth Schreier norm and Zp the pth unrestricted Schreier space.\nThe following lemma records some basic facts about this space; we omit its easy proof.\n3.3 Lemma. Let p > 1. Then:\n(i) for each m \u2208 N, the restriction to Zp of the mth coordinate functional fm given\nby (1.2) is bounded with norm 1;\n(ii) \u3008x, fm\u3009 \u2192 0 as m\u2192\u221e for each x \u2208 Zp;\n(iii) for each A \u2286 N, Zp is an invariant subspace for the projection PA given by (1.3), and\nthe restriction to Zp of PA is bounded with norm 1 (except for A = \u2205, in which case\nPA = 0);\n(iv) Zp is a Banach space with respect to the coordinatewise defined operations inherited\nfrom KN and the norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Zp .\n7\n3.4 The unconditional multiplier constant. Suppose that (bn)n\u2208N is an unconditional\nbasic sequence in a Banach space, and let (\u03b1n)n\u2208N be a scalar sequence such that the series\u2211\u221e\nn=1 \u03b1nbn converges. Then, for each scalar sequence (\u03b2n)n\u2208N with |\u03b2n| 6 |\u03b1n| for each\nn \u2208 N, the series \u2211\u221en=1 \u03b2nbn converges, and there is a constant K > 1 (independent\nof (\u03b1n)n\u2208N and (\u03b2n)n\u2208N) such that\n\u2225\u2225\u2211\u221e\nn=1 \u03b2nbn\n\u2225\u2225 6 K \u2225\u2225\u2211\u221en=1 \u03b1nbn\u2225\u2225. The smallest such\nconstant K is the unconditional multiplier constant of (bn)n\u2208N. If K = 1 (the smallest\npossible), then (bn)n\u2208N is 1-unconditional (or monotone unconditional).\n3.5 Proposition. For each p > 1, the sequence (en)n\u2208N given by (1.1) is a normalized,\n1-unconditional basic sequence in Zp.\nProof. Clearly we have \u2016en\u2016Zp = 1 for each n \u2208 N. Suppose that x =\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1 \u03b1nen\nand y =\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1 \u03b2nen are vectors in c00 with |\u03b2n| 6 |\u03b1n| for each n \u2208 N. This implies\nthat \u00b5p(y, A)p 6 \u00b5p(x,A)p for each subset A of N, and consequently \u2016y\u2016Zp 6 \u2016x\u2016Zp .\nThe conclusion now follows from the 1-unconditional counterpart of Banach\u2019s fundamental\ncharacterization of basic sequences (analogous to [30, Corollary 4.2.33], for instance). 2\n3.6 The restricted Schreier spaces. Lemma 3.3(iv) and Proposition 3.5 imply that\nSp := span {en : n \u2208 N} \u2286 Zp\nis a Banach space with a normalized, 1-unconditional basis (en)n\u2208N for each p > 1. We\ncall Sp the pth (restricted) Schreier space and refer to (en)n\u2208N as its standard unit vector\nbasis. More precisely, we usually call Sp just the pth Schreier space, inserting the adjective\n\u2018restricted\u2019 only if confusion with the unrestricted counterpart Zp seems likely. We write\n\u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Sp for the restriction to Sp of the norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Zp .\nNote that the mth biorthogonal functional associated with the standard unit vector\nbasis (en)n\u2208N for Sp is the restriction to Sp of the mth coordinate functional on KN, that\nis, e\u2032m = fm|Sp ; Lemma 3.3(i) implies that this functional has norm 1.\n3.7 Remark. The Banach space denoted by S1 in \u00a73.6 is the one which is usually called\nthe Schreier space in the literature. Beauzamy and Laprest\u00e9 formally introduced it in [6],\nbuilding on ideas from Baernstein\u2019s thesis [4]; an introduction to this work, its context,\nand many further developments is given in [15, Chapter 0].\nWe are not aware of any previous studies of the Banach spaces Zp and Sp for p > 1.\n3.8 Example. Let p > 1. As we shall see in Corollary 5.6, Zp contains a subspace iso-\nmorphic to `\u221e. Hence Zp is non-separable and cannot, therefore, have a basis, so in\nparticular Zp is not isomorphic to Sp. The purpose of this example is much simpler,\nnamely to prove that Sp is a proper subspace of Zp. More precisely, we shall show that\nz := (n\u2212\n1\np )n\u2208N \u2208 Zp \\ Sp.\nSuppose that A = {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk} \u2286 N is admissible. Since z is decreasing and\npositive, we have\n\u00b5p(z, A)\np =\nk\u2211\nj=1\n1\nnj\n6\nn1+k\u22121\u2211\nj=n1\n1\nj\n6\n2n1\u22121\u2211\nj=n1\n1\nj\n6 n1 \u00b7 1\nn1\n= 1,\n8\nso z \u2208 Zp with \u2016z\u2016Zp 6 1; in fact, z is a unit vector because \u3008z, f1\u3009 = 1. On the other hand,\nz \/\u2208 Sp because, for any y =\n\u2211m\nn=1 \u03b1nen \u2208 c00, the set B := N \u2229 (m, 2m + 1] is admissible,\nand therefore\n\u2016z \u2212 y\u2016pZp > \u00b5p(z \u2212 y,B)p =\n2m+1\u2211\nn=m+1\n1\nn\n>\n\u222b 2m+2\nm+1\ndt\nt\n= log\n2m+ 2\nm+ 1\n= log 2 > 0.\nWe shall next prove that the standard unit vector basis for Sp is shrinking for each\np > 1. As a consequence, we obtain a description of the bidual of Sp in terms of Zp. Our\napproach relies on the following well-known characterization of shrinking bases (e.g., see [1,\nProposition 3.2.7]).\n3.9 Lemma. A basis (bn)n\u2208N for a Banach space X is shrinking if and only if every nor-\nmalized block basic sequence of (bn)n\u2208N is a weakly null sequence in X.\nThe fact that the standard unit vector basis for S1 is shrinking is well-known, although\nwe have been unable to trace the original source of this result. We shall outline an elegant\nproof communicated to us by Andr\u00e1s Zs\u00e1k.\n3.10 Proposition. The standard unit vector basis (en)n\u2208N for S1 is shrinking.\nProof. Each subset A of N induces a functional \u03c9A on c00 via the definition\n\u3008x, \u03c9A\u3009 :=\n\u2211\nn\u2208A\n\u3008x, fn\u3009 (x \u2208 c00),\nand this functional is contractive with respect to the first Schreier norm if and only if the\nset A is either empty or admissible. Thus, we may regard\n\u2126 := {\u03c9A : A = \u2205 or A \u2286 N admissible}\nas a subset of the closed unit ball of S \u20321, and we have\n\u2126 =\n{\nf \u2208 S \u20321 : \u2016f\u2016S\u20321 6 1 and \u3008en, f\u3009 \u2208 {0, 1} (n \u2208 N)\n}\nwhich implies that \u2126 is weak*-closed and hence weak*-compact by the Banach\u2013Alaoglu\nTheorem.\nFor each x \u2208 S1, the mapping Ux : f 7\u2192 \u3008x, f\u3009, \u2126 \u2192 K, is continuous with respect\nto the weak*-topology on \u2126, so it induces a mapping U : S1 \u2192 C(\u2126). Straightforward\nverifications show that U is linear and contractive. Moreover, U is bounded below by\n\u03b5 :=\n{\n1\n2\nfor K = R\n1\n4\nfor K = C\nas we shall now prove. It suffices to show that, for each x \u2208 c00, there is a subset A of N,\neither admissible or empty, such that\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, \u03c9A\u3009\u2223\u2223 > \u03b5\u2016x\u2016S1 .\n9\nIn the case where x has real coordinates, take an admissible subset B of N such that\n\u2016x\u2016S1 = \u00b51(x,B). The sets B+ :=\n{\nn \u2208 B : \u3008x, fn\u3009 > 0\n}\nand B\u2212 :=\n{\nn \u2208 B : \u3008x, fn\u3009 < 0\n}\nare then admissible or empty, and they satisfy\n\u2016x\u2016S1 = \u00b51(x,B) =\n\u2211\nn\u2208B+\n\u3008x, fn\u3009 \u2212\n\u2211\nn\u2208B\u2212\n\u3008x, fn\u3009 =\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, \u03c9B+\u3009\u2223\u2223+ \u2223\u2223\u3008x, \u03c9B\u2212\u3009\u2223\u2223,\nso we conclude that\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, \u03c9A\u3009\u2223\u2223 > \u2016x\u2016S1\/2 holds for either A := B+ or A := B\u2212.\nNow suppose that x has complex coordinates and define y :=\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1 Re\u3008x, fn\u3009 en and\nz :=\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1 Im\u3008x, fn\u3009 en. Then x = y + iz, so that \u2016x\u2016S1 6 \u2016y\u2016S1 + \u2016z\u2016S1 and thus either\n\u2016y\u2016S1 > \u2016x\u2016S1\/2 or \u2016z\u2016S1 > \u2016x\u2016S1\/2. We consider the first case only; the second is similar.\nAs y has real coordinates, the first part of the argument applies, yielding an admissible (or\nempty) set A such that\n\u2223\u2223\u3008y, \u03c9A\u3009\u2223\u2223 > \u2016y\u2016S1\/2, and consequently we have\u2223\u2223\u3008x, \u03c9A\u3009\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u3008y, \u03c9A\u3009+ i\u3008z, \u03c9A\u3009\u2223\u2223 > \u2223\u2223\u3008y, \u03c9A\u3009\u2223\u2223 > \u2016y\u2016S1\n2\n> \u2016x\u2016S1\n4\n,\nas required.\nIn conclusion, U is an isomorphism of S1 onto its image inside C(\u2126). Now let (un)n\u2208N\nbe a normalized block basic sequence of (en)n\u2208N in S1. By Lemma 3.9, we must prove that\n(un)n\u2208N is weakly null in S1. This is equivalent to (Uun)n\u2208N being weakly null in C(\u2126)\nbecause the weak topology on the image of U in C(\u2126) is just the restriction of the weak\ntopology on C(\u2126). For each \u03c9A \u2208 \u2126, we have (Uun)(\u03c9A) = \u3008un, \u03c9A\u3009 = 0 eventually because\nA \u2286 N is finite, while (un)n\u2208N is a block basic sequence. Hence (Uun)n\u2208N converges\npointwise to 0 on \u2126. As this sequence is also norm-bounded, [16, Corollary IV.6.4] implies\nthat it is weakly null in C(\u2126), as required. 2\nThe proof above does not work for p > 1, but fortunately an easier route is available\nfor such p. This relies on the following result.\n3.11 Lemma. Let p > 1, and let (un)n\u2208N be a normalized block basic sequence of the\nstandard unit vector basis (en)n\u2208N for Sp. Then the operator\nT :\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b1nen 7\u2192\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b1nun,\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016`p\n)\u2192 Sp,\nis contractive, and therefore it extends uniquely to a contractive operator T : `p \u2192 Sp.\nProof. Choose integers 0 = M0 < M1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < Mn\u22121 < Mn < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 such that\nun \u2208 span{ej : Mn\u22121 < j 6Mn} (n \u2208 N).\nGiven an admissible subset A of N, define An := A \u2229 (Mn\u22121,Mn] for each n \u2208 N. Then\nA is the disjoint union of (An)n\u2208N, and each of the sets An is either empty or admissible.\n10\nHence, for x =\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1 \u03b1nen \u2208 c00, we have\n\u2016x\u2016p`p =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n|\u03b1n|p >\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n|\u03b1n|p\u00b5p(un, An)p =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u00b5p(\u03b1nun, An)\np\n=\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u00b5p\n( \u221e\u2211\nj=1\n\u03b1juj, An\n)p\n=\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u00b5p(Tx,An)\np = \u00b5p(Tx,A)\np,\nand the result follows by taking the supremum over all admissible sets A. 2\n3.12 Corollary. For each p > 1, the standard unit vector basis (en)n\u2208N for Sp is shrinking.\nProof. Let (un)n\u2208N be a normalized block basic sequence of (en)n\u2208N in Sp, and consider\nthe contractive operator T : `p \u2192 Sp from Lemma 3.11. Since p > 1, the standard unit\nvector basis (en)n\u2208N is a weakly null sequence in `p, so the boundedness of T implies that\nthe sequence (Ten)n\u2208N = (un)n\u2208N is weakly null in Sp. Hence the result follows from\nLemma 3.9. 2\n3.13 Lemma. Let p > 1. Then \u2016x\u2016bip(Sp) = \u2016x\u2016Zp for each x \u2208 KN, and so bip(Sp) = Zp.\nProof. Comparing the definitions (2.1) and (1.4), we see that\n\u2016x\u2016bip(Sp) = sup\n{\u2016Pmx\u2016Sp : m \u2208 N} (x \u2208 KN). (3.1)\nHence the inequality \u2016x\u2016bip(Sp) 6 \u2016x\u2016Zp follows from Lemma 3.3(iii) whenever x \u2208 Zp;\notherwise (that is, for x \u2208 KN \\ Zp) it is trivial.\nConversely, let A be an admissible subset of N. Taking m := maxA \u2208 N, we obtain\n\u00b5p(x,A) = \u00b5p(Pmx,A) 6 \u2016Pmx\u2016Sp 6 \u2016x\u2016bip(Sp),\nand therefore \u2016x\u2016Zp 6 \u2016x\u2016bip(Sp). 2\n3.14 The unrestricted Schreier space and the bidual of Sp. For each p > 1, we can\ncombine the results of Proposition 3.10, Corollary 3.12, Lemma 3.13, and \u00a72.4 to obtain a\ncommutative diagram\nSp\n_\n\u03b9\n\u000f\u000f\n\u001f  \u03ba \/\/ S \u2032\u2032p\n\u03a5\u223c=\n\u000f\u000f\nZp bip(Sp),\nwhere \u03b9 is the natural inclusion, \u03ba is the canonical embedding, and \u03a5 is the isometric\nisomorphism from \u00a72.4. Thus, if we identify the bidual of Sp with bip(Sp) via \u03a5, then\n\u03ba = \u03b9, that is, the canonical embedding of Sp into its bidual becomes the natural inclusion\nof Sp into Zp.\n11\n3.15 Shift operators. Let \u03c3 : N \u2192 N be strictly increasing. We associate with \u03c3 two\noperators on c00, the left shift \u039b\u03c3 and the right shift R\u03c3, given by\n\u039b\u03c3x :=\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b1\u03c3(n)en and R\u03c3x :=\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b1ne\u03c3(n)\n(\nx =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b1nen \u2208 c00\n)\n. (3.2)\nThey are clearly linear, and \u039b\u03c3R\u03c3 = Ic00 , while R\u03c3\u039b\u03c3 is the restriction to c00 of the\nprojection P\u03c3(N) given by (1.3).\nOur interest in these operators lies primarily in understanding when they extend to\nbounded operators on Sp. In order to treat both cases simultaneously (and for later use, see\nthe proof of Proposition 4.20 below), we introduce the mixed shift operator \u039e\u03c4,\u03c9 associated\nwith a pair of injective mappings \u03c4, \u03c9 : N\u2192 N by\n\u039e\u03c4,\u03c9 :\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b1nen 7\u2192\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b1\u03c4(n)e\u03c9(n), c00 \u2192 c00.\nAgain, \u039e\u03c4,\u03c9 is clearly linear, and writing \u03b9 for the identity mapping n 7\u2192 n, N\u2192 N, we see\nthat \u039b\u03c3 = \u039e\u03c3,\u03b9 and R\u03c3 = \u039e\u03b9,\u03c3.\n3.16 Lemma. Let p > 1, let \u03c4, \u03c9 : N \u2192 N be injective, and suppose that there is a\nconstant K \u2208 N such that \u03c9(n) 6 K\u03c4(n) for each n \u2208 N. Then \u2016\u039e\u03c4,\u03c9x\u2016pSp 6 K\u2016x\u2016pSp\nfor each x \u2208 c00, and thus \u039e\u03c4,\u03c9 extends uniquely to a bounded operator on Sp of norm at\nmost K\n1\np .\nProof. Let x \u2208 c00 and an admissible subset A of N be given. If A \u2229 \u03c9(N) = \u2205,\nthen \u00b5p(\u039e\u03c4,\u03c9x,A) = 0. Otherwise choose B \u2286 N such that A \u2229 \u03c9(N) = \u03c9(B), and let\nm := min \u03c4(B). Being a non-empty subset of the admissible set A, the set \u03c9(B) is itself\nadmissible, and this, together with our assumptions on \u03c9 and \u03c4 , implies that\ncardB = card\u03c9(B) 6 min\u03c9(B) 6 K min \u03c4(B) = Km,\nso we can express B as the union of K disjoint sets B1, . . . , BK , say, each having at most m\nelements. Thus each of the sets \u03c4(B1), . . . , \u03c4(BK) is admissible (or empty), and therefore\nwe have\nK\u2016x\u2016pSp >\nK\u2211\nj=1\n\u00b5p\n(\nx, \u03c4(Bj)\n)p\n= \u00b5p\n(\nx, \u03c4(B)\n)p\n=\n\u2211\nn\u2208B\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, f\u03c4(n)\u3009\u2223\u2223p\n=\n\u2211\nn\u2208B\n\u2223\u2223\u3008\u039e\u03c4,\u03c9x, f\u03c9(n)\u3009\u2223\u2223p = \u00b5p(\u039e\u03c4,\u03c9x, \u03c9(B))p = \u00b5p(\u039e\u03c4,\u03c9x,A)p.\nTaking the supremum over all admissible sets A, we conclude that K\u2016x\u2016pSp > \u2016\u039e\u03c4,\u03c9x\u2016pSp ,\nand the result follows. 2\n3.17 Corollary. Let p > 1, and let \u03c3 : N\u2192 N be strictly increasing. Then:\n12\n(i) \u2016\u039b\u03c3x\u2016Sp 6 \u2016x\u2016Sp for each x \u2208 c00, so that \u039b\u03c3 extends uniquely to a contractive\noperator on Sp, no matter what \u03c3 is;\n(ii) R\u03c3 is a bounded operator on\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Sp\n)\nif and only if there is a constant K \u2208 N\nsuch that \u03c3(n) 6 Kn for each n \u2208 N. In the positive case, R\u03c3 extends uniquely to a\nbounded operator of norm at most K\n1\np on Sp.\nProof. To prove (i), recall from \u00a73.15 that \u039b\u03c3 = \u039e\u03c3,\u03b9. Since \u03c3 is strictly increasing, we\nhave \u03c3(n) > n = \u03b9(n) for each n \u2208 N, so that the condition in Lemma 3.16 is satisfied with\nK = 1, and therefore \u039b\u03c3 extends to a bounded operator on Sp with norm at most 1.\nThe implication \u2018\u21d0\u2019 in (ii) and the final clause follow in a similar fashion, so it only re-\nmains to prove \u2018\u21d2\u2019 in (ii). Thus, suppose that R\u03c3 :\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Sp\n)\u2192 (c00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Sp) is bounded,\nlet n \u2208 N be given, and consider the unit vector z := (m\u2212 1p )m\u2208N \u2208 Zp from Example 3.8.\nIf we define N := n + \u03c3(n)\u2212 1 and A := N \u2229 [n,N ], then the set \u03c3(A) is admissible, and\nLemma 3.3(iii) implies that PAz \u2208 c00 with norm at most 1, so that\n\u2016R\u03c3\u2016p > \u2016R\u03c3PAz\u2016pSp > \u00b5p\n(\nR\u03c3PAz, \u03c3(A)\n)p\n=\nN\u2211\nm=n\n\u2223\u2223\u3008R\u03c3PAz, f\u03c3(m)\u3009\u2223\u2223p\n=\nN\u2211\nm=n\n\u2223\u2223\u3008z, fm\u3009\u2223\u2223p = N\u2211\nm=n\n1\nm\n>\n\u222b N+1\nn\ndt\nt\n= log\nN + 1\nn\n= log\n(\n1 +\n\u03c3(n)\nn\n)\nfrom which we deduce that (e\u2016R\u03c3\u2016p \u2212 1)n > \u03c3(n); hence any integer K > e\u2016R\u03c3\u2016p \u2212 1 has\nthe required property. 2\nThe following well-known observation will be called upon repeatedly in the sequel.\n3.18 Remark. Let X and Y be normed spaces, and let \u03931 : X \u2192 Y and \u03932 : Y \u2192 X be\nbounded operators with \u03931\u03932 = IY . Then P := \u03932\u03931 is a bounded idempotent operator\non X whose image is isomorphic to Y . More precisely, we have imP = im \u03932, and the\n\u2018corestriction\u2019 of \u03932 to imP (that is, the operator y 7\u2192 \u03932y, Y \u2192 imP ) is an isomorphism;\nits inverse is the restriction of \u03931 to imP .\n3.19 Corollary. For each p > 1, the pth Schreier space Sp is isomorphic to its Cartesian\nsquare Sp \u2295 Sp.\nProof. Consider the strictly increasing mappings \u03b1, \u03b2 : N\u2192 N given by\n\u03b1(n) := 2n\u2212 1 and \u03b2(n) := 2n (n \u2208 N). (3.3)\nCorollary 3.17 shows that the associated shifts \u039b\u03b1, R\u03b1, \u039b\u03b2, and R\u03b2 extend to bounded op-\nerators on Sp. Consequently, the identities stated in \u00a73.15 immediately after (3.2) together\nwith Remark 3.18 imply that Q\u03b1 := R\u03b1\u039b\u03b1 and Q\u03b2 := R\u03b2\u039b\u03b2 are bounded idempotent\noperators on Sp whose images are isomorphic to Sp, and therefore we have\nSp \u2295 Sp \u223c= imQ\u03b1 \u2295 imQ\u03b2 \u223c= Sp,\n13\nwhere the final isomorphism follows from the fact that imQ\u03b2 = kerQ\u03b1, so that imQ\u03b1 and\nimQ\u03b2 are closed, complementary subspaces of Sp. 2\n3.20 Further results. We conclude this section by listing a few results from the literature\non Schreier spaces.\n(i) Alspach and Argyros [2] have generalized the notion of admissible subset of N by intro-\nducing the Schreier families of finite subsets of N. The Schreier families are indexed\nby the countable ordinals; the first one is exactly the collection of all admissible\nsubsets of N. In analogy with the definition of the pth Schreier space based on the\nadmissible subsets of N (as presented in this section), one can associate a pth Schreier\nspace with each Schreier family. There is a substantial body of theory concerning\nthese spaces in the case p = 1; the case p > 1 appears to be unchartered territory.\n(ii) Gasparis and Leung [19] have studied the complemented subspaces of the first Schreier\nspace S1 (as well as those of the generalized Schreier spaces of Alspach and Argyros de-\nscribed above). Their main result is that there are uncountably many non-isomorphic\nsubspaces among those of the form span {en : n \u2208 A}, where A is an infinite subset\nof N.\n4 Introduction to the James\u2013Schreier spaces\nWe shall now amalgamate the definitions of the pth James space and the pth Schreier space\nfor each p > 1. Recall from \u00a72.1 that, by definition, the pth James norm of x \u2208 KN is\nthe supremum of \u03bdp(x,A) over all finite subsets A of N; our idea is to consider only those\nsets A which satisfy an admissibility-like condition.\n4.1 Definition. A subset A of N is permissible if\n2 6 cardA 6 1 + minA.\nThus a permissible set must contain at least two elements and be finite, and for\nA = {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk+1} \u2286 N, where k \u2208 N, we have\nA is permissible \u21d0\u21d2 k 6 n1.\n4.2 Definition. Let 1 6 p <\u221e. For x = (\u03b1n)n\u2208N \u2208 KN, we define\n\u2016x\u2016Wp := sup\n{\n\u03bdp(x,A) : A \u2286 N is permissible\n}\n= sup\n{( k\u2211\nj=1\n|\u03b1nj \u2212 \u03b1nj+1|p\n) 1\np\n: k, n1, . . . , nk+1 \u2208 N, k 6 n1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk+1\n}\n,\nand we then let Wp :=\n{\nx \u2208 c0 : \u2016x\u2016Wp < \u221e\n}\n. We call \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Wp the pth James\u2013Schreier\nnorm and Wp the pth unrestricted James\u2013Schreier space.\n14\nThe following lemma is the James\u2013Schreier counterpart of Lemma 3.3; we omit its\nroutine proof.\n4.3 Lemma. Let p > 1 and m \u2208 N. Then:\n(i) the restriction to Wp of the mth coordinate functional fm given by (1.2) is bounded\nwith norm 1;\n(ii) Wp is an invariant subspace for the mth natural projection Pm given by (1.4), and\nthe restriction of Pm to Wp is bounded with norm 1;\n(iii) Wp is a Banach space with respect to the coordinatewise defined operations inherited\nfrom KN and the norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Wp .\nWe shall next show that, for each p > 1, Wp contains a complemented subspace which\nis isomorphic to the unrestricted Schreier space Zp. In the proof we require the following\nwell-known inequality\n|\u03b1 + \u03b2|p 6 2p\u22121(|\u03b1|p + |\u03b2|p) (p > 1, \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 K) (4.1)\nwhich is an easy consequence of the convexity of the function t 7\u2192 tp, [0,\u221e)\u2192 [0,\u221e).\n4.4 Definition. For x = (\u03b1n)n\u2208N \u2208 KN, let\n\u03a6x := (0, \u03b11, 0, \u03b12, 0, \u03b13, . . .) \u2208 KN and \u03a8x := (\u03b12n \u2212 \u03b12n\u22121)n\u2208N \u2208 KN. (4.2)\n4.5 Proposition. Let p > 1. The first equation in (4.2) defines a bounded operator \u03a6\nfrom Zp to Wp of norm at most 21+\n1\np , while the second defines a bounded operator \u03a8\nfrom Wp to Zp of norm 1. These operators satisfy \u03a8\u03a6 = IZp , and hence \u03a6\u03a8 is idempotent\nwith\nim(\u03a6\u03a8) =\n{\n(\u03b1n)n\u2208N \u2208 Wp : \u03b12n\u22121 = 0 (n \u2208 N)\n} \u223c= Zp.\nProof. Considered as mappings on KN, \u03a6 and \u03a8 are clearly both linear, so to establish the\nfirst part of the proposition, it suffices to show that\n(i) \u03a6x \u2208 Wp with \u2016\u03a6x\u2016Wp 6 21+\n1\np\u2016x\u2016Zp for each x \u2208 Zp; and\n(ii) \u03a8x \u2208 Zp with \u2016\u03a8x\u2016Zp 6 \u2016x\u2016Wp for each x \u2208 Wp, with equality for some x \u2208 Wp.\nTo prove (i), let x \u2208 Zp be given. Lemma 3.3(ii) implies that x \u2208 c0, and therefore\n\u03a6x \u2208 c0 by the definition of \u03a6. Now suppose that A = {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk+1} is a permis-\nsible subset of N. If A\u22292N = \u2205, then \u03bdp(\u03a6x,A) = 0. Otherwise we choose `,m1, . . . ,m` \u2208 N\nsuch that A \u2229 2N = {2m1 < 2m2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < 2m`}. Using the inequality (4.1), we obtain\n\u03bdp(\u03a6x,A)\np =\nk\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008\u03a6x, fnj \u2212 fnj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p 6 2p\u22121 k\u2211\nj=1\n(\u2223\u2223\u3008\u03a6x, fnj\u3009\u2223\u2223p + \u2223\u2223\u3008\u03a6x, fnj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p)\n6 2p\u00b5p(\u03a6x,A)p = 2p\u00b5p(\u03a6x,A \u2229 2N)p = 2p\u00b5p(x,B)p, (4.3)\n15\nwhere we have introduced B := {m1 < m2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < m`} \u2286 N. Now let h := min{m1, `},\nB1 := {m1 < m2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < mh} \u2286 N, and B2 := B \\B1 \u2286 N; we claim that\n\u00b5p(x,Bj) 6 \u2016x\u2016Zp (j = 1, 2). (4.4)\nThis is immediate for j = 1 because the definition of h ensures that B1 is admissible. If\nh = `, then B2 = \u2205, so that (4.4) is satisfied for j = 2 by convention. Otherwise h = m1 < `\nand B2 = {mh+1 < mh+2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < m`}, so that B2 is admissible because\nminB2 = mh+1 > mh + 1 > mh\u22121 + 2 > \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 > m1 + h\n= 2m1 > minA > (cardA)\u2212 1 > `\u2212 1 > `\u2212 h = cardB2,\nand (4.4) for j = 2 follows. Since B is the disjoint union of B1 and B2, we conclude that\n\u00b5p(x,B)\np = \u00b5p(x,B1)\np + \u00b5p(x,B2)\np 6 2\u2016x\u2016pZp .\nSubstituting this into (4.3) and then taking the supremum over all permissible sets A, we\nsee that (i) is satisfied.\nTo prove (ii), let x \u2208 Wp, and suppose that A = {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk} \u2286 N is\nadmissible, so that k 6 n1. Then the set B := {2nj \u2212 1, 2nj : 1 6 j 6 k} \u2286 N is\npermissible because cardB = 2k 6 2n1 = 1 + minB, and consequently we have\n\u2016x\u2016pWp > \u03bdp(x,B)p\n=\nk\u22121\u2211\nj=1\n(\u2223\u2223\u3008x, f2nj\u22121 \u2212 f2nj\u3009\u2223\u2223p + \u2223\u2223\u3008x, f2nj \u2212 f2nj+1\u22121\u3009\u2223\u2223p)+ \u2223\u2223\u3008x, f2nk\u22121 \u2212 f2nk\u3009\u2223\u2223p\n>\nk\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, f2nj\u22121 \u2212 f2nj\u3009\u2223\u2223p = k\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008\u03a8x, fnj\u3009\u2223\u2223p = \u00b5p(\u03a8x,A)p.\nTaking the supremum over all admissible sets A, we conclude that \u2016x\u2016Wp > \u2016\u03a8x\u2016Zp , as\nrequired. Since \u03a8e1 = \u2212e1 and e1 is a unit vector in both Wp and Zp, equality does occur.\nThis completes the proof of (ii).\nDirect application of the definitions (4.2) shows that \u03a8\u03a6 = IZp , so Remark 3.18 implies\nthat P := \u03a6\u03a8 is a bounded idempotent operator with image isomorphic to Zp, and clearly\nimP \u2286 {(\u03b1n)n\u2208N \u2208 Wp : \u03b12n\u22121 = 0 (n \u2208 N)}.\nConversely, suppose that x = (\u03b1n)n\u2208N \u2208 Wp satisfies \u03b12n\u22121 = 0 for each n \u2208 N; then we\nhave\nimP 3 Px = \u03a6\u03a8x = \u03a6(\u03b12n)n\u2208N = (0, \u03b12, 0, \u03b14, 0, \u03b16, . . .) = x,\nas required. 2\n4.6 Remark. We can now give an easy proof of Lemma 3.3(iv). Indeed, Proposition 4.5\nimplies that Zp is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of Wp, which is a Banach space\nby Lemma 4.3(iii). Complemented subspaces are automatically closed, hence complete,\nand therefore Zp is also complete.\n16\n4.7 Proposition. For each p > 1, the sequence (en)n\u2208N given by (1.1) is a monotone basic\nsequence in Wp.\nProof. Lemma 4.3(ii) implies that \u2016Pmx\u2016Wp 6 \u2016x\u2016Wp for each x \u2208 c00 and m \u2208 N, and\nhence the result follows from the monotone version of Banach\u2019s fundamental characteriza-\ntion of basic sequences (e.g., see [27, Proposition 1.a.3] or [30, Corollary 4.1.25]). 2\n4.8 The restricted James\u2013Schreier spaces. Lemma 4.3(iii) and Proposition 4.7 imply\nthat\nVp := span {en : n \u2208 N} \u2286 Wp\nis a Banach space with a monotone basis (en)n\u2208N for each p > 1. We call Vp the pth\n(restricted) James\u2013Schreier space and refer to (en)n\u2208N as its standard basis. As in the case\nof the Schreier spaces, we omit the adjective \u2018restricted\u2019, unless confusion with Wp seems\nlikely. We write \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Vp for the restriction to Vp of the norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Wp .\nNote that the mth biorthogonal functional associated with the standard basis (en)n\u2208N\nfor Vp is the restriction to Vp of the mth coordinate functional on KN, that is, e\u2032m = fm|Vp ;\nthis functional has norm 1 by Lemma 4.3(i).\n4.9 Remark. (i) Only the first two basis vectors e1 and e2 are normalized in the pth\nJames\u2013Schreier norm; for n > 3, we have \u2016en\u2016Vp = \u03bdp\n(\nen, {n\u2212 1, n, n+ 1}\n)\n= 2\n1\np .\n(ii) The basis (en)n\u2208N is not an unconditional basis for Vp because \u03c7[1,2n] is a unit vector\nfor each n \u2208 N, whereas\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 2n\u2211\nj=1\n(\u22121)jej\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\nVp\n= \u03bdp\n( 2n\u2211\nj=1\n(\u22121)jej, {n, n+ 1, . . . , 2n}\n)\n= 2n\n1\np \u2192\u221e as n\u2192\u221e.\nWe shall prove a much stronger result in Section 6.\nWe observe next that Proposition 4.5 carries over to the restricted spaces.\n4.10 Proposition. Let p > 1. The first equation in (4.2) defines a bounded operator \u03a6\nfrom Sp to Vp of norm at most 21+\n1\np , while the second defines a bounded operator \u03a8 from\nVp to Sp of norm 1. These operators satisfy \u03a8\u03a6 = ISp , and hence \u03a6\u03a8 is idempotent with\nim(\u03a6\u03a8) = span {e2n : n \u2208 N} \u223c= Sp.\nProof. The operators \u03a6 and \u03a8 given by (4.2) clearly leave c00 invariant. Since c00 is dense\nin both Sp and Vp, and \u03a6 and \u03a8 are bounded on the unrestricted spaces Zp and Wp,\nwe conclude that \u03a6(Sp) \u2286 Vp and \u03a8(Vp) \u2286 Sp. The result is now easy to deduce from\nProposition 4.5. 2\nThe following example is the James\u2013Schreier analogue of Example 3.8.\n4.11 Example. Let p > 1. Using the vector z := (n\u2212\n1\np )n\u2208N \u2208 Zp \\ Sp from Example 3.8,\nwe can easily verify that Vp is a proper subspace ofWp. Indeed, Proposition 4.5 implies that\n17\ny := \u03a6z \u2208 Wp, but y \/\u2208 Vp because if it were, \u03a8y \u2208 Sp by Proposition 4.10, contradicting\nthat \u03a8y = z \/\u2208 Sp.\nThe much stronger conclusion that Wp 6\u223c= Vp will follow from Section 5.\nWe shall next show that the standard basis for Vp is shrinking whenever p > 1; this will\nenable us to describe the bidual of Vp in terms of Wp.\n4.12 Proposition. For each p > 1, the standard basis (en)n\u2208N for Vp is shrinking.\nThe proof of this result is identical to that of Corollary 3.12 provided that the operator T\nfrom Lemma 3.11 is replaced with the operator U from the following lemma throughout.\n4.13 Lemma. Let p > 1, and let (un)n\u2208N be a normalized block basic sequence of the\nstandard basis (en)n\u2208N for Vp. Then the operator\nU :\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b1nen 7\u2192\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b1nun,\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016`p\n)\u2192 Vp,\nis bounded, and therefore it extends uniquely to a bounded operator U : `p \u2192 Vp.\nProof. As in the proof of Lemma 3.11, choose integers 0 = M0 < M1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < Mn < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nsuch that un \u2208 span{ej : Mn\u22121 < j 6 Mn} for each n \u2208 N. Given a permissible subset A\nof N, take natural numbers k and n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk such that\nA \u2229 (Mn\u22121,Mn] 6= \u2205 \u21d0\u21d2 n \u2208 {n1, n2, . . . , nk} (n \u2208 N),\nand define Aj := A \u2229 (Mnj\u22121,Mnj ] for j = 1, 2, . . . , k. Then A is the disjoint union\nof the sets A1, . . . , Ak, each of which is either a singleton or permissible, and for each\nx =\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1 \u03b1nen \u2208 c00, we have\n\u03bdp(Ux,A)\np =\nk\u2211\nj=1\n\u03bdp(Ux,Aj)\np +\nk\u22121\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fmaxAj \u2212 fminAj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p\n6\nby (4.1)\nk\u2211\nj=1\n\u03bdp(\u03b1njunj , Aj)\np + 2p\u22121\nk\u22121\u2211\nj=1\n(\u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fmaxAj\u3009\u2223\u2223p + \u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fminAj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p)\n6\nk\u2211\nj=1\n|\u03b1nj |p\u2016unj\u2016pVp\n+ 2p\u22121\nk\u22121\u2211\nj=1\n(\n|\u03b1nj |p\n\u2223\u2223\u3008unj , fmaxAj\u3009\u2223\u2223p + |\u03b1nj+1 |p\u2223\u2223\u3008unj+1 , fminAj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p)\n6 (2p + 1)\nk\u2211\nj=1\n|\u03b1nj |p 6 (2p + 1)\u2016x\u2016p`p .\nThe result now follows by taking the supremum over all permissible sets A. 2\n18\nWe have not been able to decide whether or not Proposition 4.12 extends to the case\nwhere p = 1, that is, the following question is open.\n4.14 Question. Is the standard basis (en)n\u2208N for V1 shrinking?\nNote added in proof. Question 4.14 has been answered in the positive; see [10].\n4.15 Lemma. Let p > 1. Then Wp and K\u03c7N are closed, complementary subspaces of\nbip(Vp), and \u2016w\u2016Wp = \u2016w\u2016bip(Vp) for each w \u2208 Wp.\nProof. We have Wp \u2229K\u03c7N = {0} because Wp \u2286 c0 by definition.\nLemma 4.3(ii) implies that\n\u2016w\u2016bip(Vp) 6 \u2016w\u2016Wp (w \u2208 Wp), (4.5)\nso that in particular Wp \u2286 bip(Vp). Moreover, \u03c7N \u2208 bip(Vp) because Pm\u03c7N = \u03c7[1,m] is a\nunit vector in Vp for each m \u2208 N, and consequently Wp +K\u03c7N \u2286 bip(Vp).\nConversely, suppose that x \u2208 bip(Vp). We claim that the sequence x =\n(\u3008x, fn\u3009)n\u2208N is\nconvergent in K. If not, x fails to be a Cauchy sequence, so we can find \u03b5 > 0 and integers\n1 = N1 < N2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < Nj < Nj+1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 such that\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, fNj \u2212 fNj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223 > \u03b5 for each j \u2208 N.\nTake k \u2208 N such that k\u03b5p > \u2016x\u2016pbip(Vp), and choose m \u2208 N such that Nm > k. The set\nA := {Nm < Nm+1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < Nm+k} is then permissible, and therefore we have\n\u2016x\u2016pbip(Vp) > \u03bdp(PNm+kx,A)p =\nm+k\u22121\u2211\nj=m\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, fNj \u2212 fNj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p > k\u03b5p > \u2016x\u2016pbip(Vp)\nwhich is clearly absurd. Thus x is convergent with limit \u03b1 \u2208 K, say.\nWe now claim that w := x\u2212\u03b1\u03c7N belongs to Wp; indeed, w \u2208 c0 by the choice of \u03b1, and\n\u2016w\u2016Wp 6 \u2016x\u2016bip(Vp) (4.6)\nbecause, for each permissible subset A = {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk+1} of N, we have\n\u03bdp(w,A)\np =\nk\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223\u2223(\u3008x, fnj\u3009 \u2212 \u03b1)\u2212 (\u3008x, fnj+1\u3009 \u2212 \u03b1)\u2223\u2223\u2223p = \u03bdp(Pnk+1x,A)p 6 \u2016x\u2016pbip(Vp).\nHence we conclude that x = w + \u03b1\u03c7N \u2208 Wp +K\u03c7N, and therefore bip(Vp) = Wp +K\u03c7N.\nTo complete the proof, we note that if x \u2208 Wp in the argument given above, then \u03b1 = 0,\nso that w = x, and therefore (4.5)\u2013(4.6) combine to show that \u2016w\u2016Wp = \u2016w\u2016bip(Vp) for each\nw \u2208 Wp. In particular, this implies that the subspace Wp is closed in bip(Vp) because it is\ncomplete with respect to the norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Wp and thus also with respect to \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016bip(Vp). The\nsubspace K\u03c7N is closed because it is finite-dimensional. 2\n4.16 Remark. Lemma 4.15 can be rephrased as follows:\n(\nbip(Vp), \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016bip(Vp)\n)\ncontains(\nWp, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Wp\n)\nisometrically, and \u03bb : (\u03b1n)n\u2208N 7\u2192 limn\u2192\u221e \u03b1n defines a bounded functional\non bip(Vp) whose kernel is Wp.\n19\n4.17 The unrestricted James\u2013Schreier space and the bidual of Vp. For p > 1, we\ncan summarize our findings in the commutative diagram\nVp\n_\n\u03b9\n\u000f\u000f\n\u001f  \u03ba \/\/ V \u2032\u2032p\n\u03a5\u223c=\n\u000f\u000f\nWp\n\u001f  \u03b9 \/\/Wp \u2295K\u03c7N bip(Vp),\nwhere both \u03b9\u2019s are the natural inclusions, \u03ba is the canonical embedding, and \u03a5 is the\nisometric isomorphism from \u00a72.4. Thus, if we identify the bidual of Vp with bip(Vp) via \u03a5,\nthen \u03ba = \u03b9, that is, the canonical embedding of Vp into its bidual becomes the natural\ninclusion of Vp into Wp \u2295K\u03c7N.\nFinally in this section we take a look at shift operators on the James\u2013Schreier spaces.\nWe begin with an easy result that characterizes the increasing mappings \u03c3 : N \u2192 N for\nwhich the associated left and right shifts \u039b\u03c3 and R\u03c3 (as defined in (3.2)) are bounded as\noperators on\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Vp\n)\n.\n4.18 Proposition. Let p > 1, and let \u03c3 : N\u2192 N be strictly increasing. Then:\n(i) \u2016\u039b\u03c3x\u2016Vp 6 \u2016x\u2016Vp for each x \u2208 c00, so that \u039b\u03c3 extends uniquely to a contractive\noperator on Vp, no matter what \u03c3 is;\n(ii) the operator R\u03c3 is bounded on\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Vp\n)\nif and only if \u03c3(N) is cofinite in N.\nProof. (i). Given x \u2208 c00 and a permissible subset A = {n1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk+1} of N, we have\n\u03bdp(\u039b\u03c3x,A)\np =\nk\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008\u039b\u03c3x, fnj \u2212 fnj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p = k\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, f\u03c3(nj) \u2212 f\u03c3(nj+1)\u3009\u2223\u2223p\n= \u03bdp\n(\nx, \u03c3(A)\n)p 6 \u2016x\u2016pVp ,\nwhere the final inequality follows from the fact that the set \u03c3(A) is permissible (because \u03c3\nis strictly increasing).\n(ii). It is easy to see that R\u03c3 is bounded if \u03c3(N) is cofinite in N.\nConversely, suppose that the set N \\ \u03c3(N) is infinite, and take a strictly increasing\nsequence (mj)j\u2208N of natural numbers such that \u03c3(mj) + 1 \/\u2208 \u03c3(N) for each j \u2208 N. Then,\nfor given k \u2208 N, we can find n \u2208 N such that \u03c3(mn) > 2k + 1. This implies that the set\nA :=\n{\n\u03c3(mj), \u03c3(mj) + 1 : n 6 j 6 n+ k\n}\nis permissible, and therefore we have\n\u2016R\u03c3\u03c7[1,mn+k]\u2016pVp > \u03bdp(R\u03c3\u03c7[1,mn+k], A)p = 2k + 1.\nSince \u2016\u03c7[1,m]\u2016Vp = 1, no matter what m \u2208 N is, while (2k + 1)\n1\np \u2192 \u221e as k \u2192 \u221e, we\nconclude that the operator R\u03c3 is unbounded on\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Vp\n)\n. 2\n20\nThus, if we want to right-shift elements of Vp in a non-trivial way, a different approach\nwhich does not introduce \u2018gaps\u2019 between coordinates is required. This is the motivation\nbehind the following definition.\n4.19 Definition. Let \u03c3 : N\u2192 N be strictly increasing. We associate with \u03c3 the block right\nshift\n\u0398\u03c3 :\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b1nen 7\u2192\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b1n\u03c7(\u03c3(n\u22121),\u03c3(n)], c00 \u2192 c00, (4.7)\nwith the standing convention that \u03c3(0) := 0.\nThis block right shift is bounded on\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Vp\n)\nunder exactly the same condition that\nthe usual right shift is bounded on\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Sp\n)\n(see Corollary 3.17(ii)), as the following\nproposition shows; this result will be important in the study [9] of Vp as a Banach algebra.\n4.20 Proposition. Let p > 1, and let \u03c3 : N \u2192 N be strictly increasing. The block right\nshift \u0398\u03c3 is bounded on\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Vp\n)\nif and only if there is a constant K \u2208 N such that\n\u03c3(n) 6 Kn for each n \u2208 N. In the positive case, \u0398\u03c3 extends uniquely to a bounded\noperator of norm at most K\n1\np on Vp.\nProof. \u21d0. Suppose that there is a constant K \u2208 N such that \u03c3(n) 6 Kn for each n \u2208 N,\nand let x \u2208 c00 and a permissible subset A of N be given. Take natural numbers k and\nm1 < m2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < mk and non-empty sets A1, . . . , Ak with Aj \u2286\n(\n\u03c3(mj \u2212 1), \u03c3(mj)\n]\nfor\neach j \u2208 {1, . . . , k} (with the convention that \u03c3(0) = 0) such that A = \u22c3kj=1Aj. If k = 1,\nthen \u03bdp(\u0398\u03c3x,A) = 0, whereas for k > 2, we have\n\u03bdp(\u0398\u03c3x,A)\np =\nk\u22121\u2211\nj=1\n(\n\u03bdp(\u0398\u03c3x,Aj)\np +\n\u2223\u2223\u3008\u0398\u03c3x, fmaxAj \u2212 fminAj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p)+ \u03bdp(\u0398\u03c3x,Ak)p\n=\nk\u22121\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008\u0398\u03c3x, fmaxAj \u2212 fminAj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p = k\u22121\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, fmj \u2212 fmj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p. (4.8)\nThe permissibility of A and our assumption on \u03c3 imply that\nk 6 cardA 6 1 + minA 6 1 + \u03c3(m1) 6 1 +Km1. (4.9)\nIf this inequality is strict, choose integers m1+Km1 > mKm1 > \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 > mk+1, all greater\nthan mk. We can then define Bj := {mh : (j \u2212 1)m1 + 1 6 h 6 jm1 + 1} \u2286 N for each\nj = {1, . . . , K}, and this set is permissible because cardBj = 1 +m1 6 1 + minBj. Hence\nwe conclude that\nK\u2016x\u2016pVp >\nK\u2211\nj=1\n\u03bdp\n(\nx,Bj)\np =\nKm1\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, fmj \u2212 fmj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p > \u03bdp(\u0398\u03c3x,A)p,\n21\nwhere the final inequality follows from (4.8)\u2013(4.9). Taking the supremum over all permis-\nsible sets A, we obtain K\u2016x\u2016pVp > \u2016\u0398\u03c3x\u2016pVp , so that \u0398\u03c3 is bounded with norm at most K\n1\np .\n\u21d2. Conversely, suppose that \u0398\u03c3 is bounded on\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Vp\n)\n, and consider the strictly\nincreasing mappings \u03b3, \u03c4 : N \u2192 N given by \u03b3(n) := 2n + 1 and \u03c4(n) := \u03c3(2n \u2212 1) + 1 for\neach n \u2208 N. We then see that the diagram(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Sp\n)\n\u03a6\n\u000f\u000f\nR\u03c3 \/\/\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Sp\n)\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Vp\n)\n\u0398\u03c3\n\u000f\u000f\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Sp\n)\n\u039e\u03c4,\u03c3\nOO\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Vp\n) \u0398\u03b3 \/\/ (c00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016Vp)\n\u03a8\nOO\nis commutative because\n\u039e\u03c4,\u03c3\u03a8\u0398\u03b3\u0398\u03c3\u03a6en = \u039e\u03c4,\u03c3\u03a8\u0398\u03b3\u0398\u03c3e2n = \u039e\u03c4,\u03c3\u03a8\u0398\u03b3\u03c7(\u03c3(2n\u22121),\u03c3(2n)]\n= \u039e\u03c4,\u03c3\u03a8\u03c7(2\u03c3(2n\u22121)+1,2\u03c3(2n)+1] = \u039e\u03c4,\u03c3(e\u03c3(2n\u22121)+1 \u2212 e\u03c3(2n)+1)\n= \u039e\u03c4,\u03c3e\u03c4(n) \u2212 \u039e\u03c4,\u03c3e\u03c3(2n)+1 = e\u03c3(n) \u2212 0 = R\u03c3en (n \u2208 N).\nMoreover, the operators \u03a6, \u0398\u03c3, \u0398\u03b3, \u03a8, and \u039e\u03c4,\u03c3 are all bounded with respect to the norms\non their domains and codomains specified in the diagram; this follows from Proposition 4.10\nfor \u03a6 and \u03a8, from our assumption for \u0398\u03c3, from the implication \u2018\u21d0\u2019 proved above for \u0398\u03b3\n(because \u03b3(n) = 2n + 1 6 3n for each n \u2208 N), and from Lemma 3.16 for \u039e\u03c4,\u03c3 (because\n\u03c3(n) 6 \u03c3(2n \u2212 1) + 1 = \u03c4(n) for each n \u2208 N). Hence the commutativity of the dia-\ngram implies that R\u03c3 is bounded, and therefore we have \u03c3(n) 6 Kn for each n \u2208 N by\nCorollary 3.17(ii). 2\nRecall that the pth James space Jp is not isomorphic to its Cartesian square for any\np > 1, whereas we saw in Corollary 3.19 that the pth Schreier space Sp is isomorphic to\nits Cartesian square for each p > 1. We have not been able to answer the corresponding\nquestion for the James\u2013Schreier spaces, so we state it formally.\n4.21 Question. Let p > 1. Is the pth James\u2013Schreier space Vp isomorphic to its Cartesian\nsquare Vp \u2295 Vp?\n5 The James\u2013Schreier spaces are c0-saturated\n5.1 Definition. Let X and Y be infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. We say that X is\nY -saturated if each closed, infinite-dimensional subspace of X contains a subspace which\nis isomorphic to Y .\n22\nThe aim of this section is to prove the following result.\n5.2 Theorem. For each p > 1, the pth James\u2013Schreier space Vp is c0-saturated.\nWe isolate the key step in the proof of Theorem 5.2 in the following lemma.\n5.3 Lemma. Let p > 1. Every block basic sequence of the standard basis for Vp has a\nblock basic sequence which is equivalent to the standard unit vector basis for c0.\nProof. Suppose that (un)n\u2208N is a block basic sequence of (en)n\u2208N, and choose integers\n0 = L0 < L1 < L2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 such that un \u2208 span{ej : Ln\u22121 < j 6 Ln} for each n \u2208 N. By\ninduction, we shall construct sequences (Mn)n\u2208N and (Nn)n\u2208N of natural numbers with\nM1 6 N1 < M2 6 N2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 and a sequence (vn)n\u2208N of unit vectors in Vp such that\nvn \u2208 span{uj : Mn 6 j 6 Nn} and\n\u2223\u2223\u3008vn+1, fk\u3009\u2223\u2223 6 L\u2212 1pNn (n, k \u2208 N). (5.1)\nTo start the induction, take M1 := N1 := 1 and v1 := u1\/\u2016u1\u2016Vp \u2208 Vp. Then v1 is a\nunit vector which satisfies the first part of (5.1) by definition; the second part is void in\nthis case.\nNow let n \u2208 N, and assume that natural numbers M1 6 N1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < Mn 6 Nn and unit\nvectors v1, . . . , vn in Vp have been chosen in accordance with (5.1).\nIf there is an integer m > Nn such that\n\u2223\u2223\u3008um, fk\u3009\u2223\u2223 6 L\u2212 1pNn \u2016um\u2016Vp for each k \u2208 N, then\nwe can simply take Mn+1 := Nn+1 := m and vn+1 := um\/\u2016um\u2016Vp \u2208 Vp.\nOtherwise, for each m > Nn, we can find km \u2208 N such that\u2223\u2223\u3008um, fkm\u3009\u2223\u2223 > L\u2212 1pNn \u2016um\u2016Vp . (5.2)\nIn particular, \u3008um, fkm\u3009 6= 0, so that\nLm\u22121 < km 6 Lm, (5.3)\nand therefore the sequence (km)\u221em=Nn+1 is strictly increasing. We now choose an integer\nK > 2\u2212p(L2Nn \u2212 1) + 1, we then pick an integer Mn+1 > Nn such that kMn+1 > K, and\nfinally we define Nn+1 := Mn+1 + K \u2212 1 > Mn+1. These choices ensure that the set\nA := {km : Mn+1 6 m 6 Nn+1 + 1} is permissible, and consequently we can estimate the\nJames\u2013Schreier norm of the vector\nw :=\nNn+1\u2211\nj=Mn+1\n\u03b1juj \u2208 Vp, where \u03b1j :=\n(\u22121)j \u3008uj, fkj\u3009\u2223\u2223\u3008uj, fkj\u3009\u2223\u2223 \u00b7 \u2016uj\u2016Vp \u2208 K, (5.4)\nas follows:\n\u2016w\u2016pVp > \u03bdp(w,A)p =\nNn+1\u2211\nm=Mn+1\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 Nn+1\u2211\nj=Mn+1\n\u03b1j\n(\u3008uj, fkm\u3009 \u2212 \u3008uj, fkm+1\u3009)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223p\n=\nby (5.3)\nNn+1\u22121\u2211\nm=Mn+1\n\u2223\u2223\u03b1m\u3008um, fkm\u3009 \u2212 \u03b1m+1\u3008um+1, fkm+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p + \u2223\u2223\u03b1Nn+1\u3008uNn+1 , fkNn+1 \u3009\u2223\u2223p\n23\n=\nby (5.4)\nNn+1\u22121\u2211\nm=Mn+1\n(\u2223\u2223\u3008um, fkm\u3009\u2223\u2223\n\u2016um\u2016Vp\n+\n\u2223\u2223\u3008um+1, fkm+1\u3009\u2223\u2223\n\u2016um+1\u2016Vp\n)p\n+\n(\u2223\u2223\u3008uNn+1 , fkNn+1 \u3009\u2223\u2223\n\u2016uNn+1\u2016Vp\n)p\n>\nby (5.2)\nNn+1\u22121\u2211\nm=Mn+1\n(\n2L\n\u2212 1\np\nNn\n)p\n+\n(\nL\n\u2212 1\np\nNn\n)p\n=\n2p(K \u2212 1) + 1\nLNn\n> LNn (5.5)\nby the choice of K. In particular we have w 6= 0, so vn+1 := w\/\u2016w\u2016Vp defines a unit vector\nin Vp, and (5.4) implies that this vector satisfies the first part of (5.1). To verify the second\npart, we use the fact that (uj)j\u2208N is a block basic sequence to obtain\u2223\u2223\u3008vn+1, fk\u3009\u2223\u2223 = 1\u2016w\u2016Vp max\n{\u2223\u2223\u03b1j \u3008uj, fk\u3009\u2223\u2223 : Mn+1 6 j 6 Nn+1}\n=\n1\n\u2016w\u2016Vp\nmax\n{\u2223\u2223\u3008uj, fk\u3009\u2223\u2223\n\u2016uj\u2016Vp\n: Mn+1 6 j 6 Nn+1\n}\n6 1\u2016w\u2016Vp\n6 L\u2212\n1\np\nNn\n(k \u2208 N),\nwhere the final inequality follows from (5.5). Hence the induction continues.\nWe shall next show that the block basic sequence (vn)n\u2208N constructed above is equivalent\nto the standard unit vector basis of c0; this will clearly complete the proof. To this end,\nwe consider the linear mapping\nU :\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b2nen 7\u2192\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b2nvn,\n(\nc00, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016c0\n)\u2192 Vp.\nOur aim is to show that U is an isomorphism onto its image, that is, we want to prove\nthat there are constants C1, C2 > 0 such that\nC1\u2016x\u2016c0 6 \u2016Ux\u2016Vp 6 C2\u2016x\u2016c0 (x \u2208 c00). (5.6)\nGiven x =\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1 \u03b2nen \u2208 c00, take ` \u2208 N such that \u2016x\u2016c0 = |\u03b2`|. Then we have\n\u2016x\u2016c0 = \u2016\u03b2`v`\u2016Vp\n=\n{\n\u2016PLN1 (Ux)\u2016Vp 6 \u2016PLN1\u2016 \u2016Ux\u2016Vp for ` = 1\u2225\u2225(PLN` \u2212 PLN`\u22121 )Ux\u2225\u2225Vp 6 \u2016PLN` \u2212 PLN`\u22121\u2016 \u2016Ux\u2016Vp for ` > 2\n}\n6 2\u2016Ux\u2016Vp\nby Lemma 4.3(ii). Hence the first inequality in (5.6) holds with C1 := 1\/2.\nTo prove the second, let a permissible subset A = {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk+1} of N be\ngiven. Choose h \u2208 N minimal such that n1 6 LNh , and then take g \u2208 {1, . . . , k + 1}\nmaximal such that ng 6 LNh . If g = k+ 1, then A \u2286 (LNh\u22121 , LNh ] (with N0 := 0 if h = 1),\nand we have\n\u03bdp(Ux,A)\np = \u03bdp(\u03b2hvh, A)\np 6 \u2016\u03b2hvh\u2016pVp = |\u03b2h|p 6 \u2016x\u2016pc0 . (5.7)\nOtherwise (that is, when g 6 k) we write\n\u03bdp(Ux,A)\np =\ng\u22121\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fnj \u2212 fnj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p + \u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fng \u2212 fng+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p + k\u2211\nj=g+1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fnj \u2212 fnj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p,\n24\nwhere we ignore the left-hand sum if g = 1 and the right-hand sum if g = k. Application\nof the inequality (4.1) to the middle term and the right-hand sum (but not the left-hand\nsum) yields\n\u03bdp(Ux,A)\np 6\ng\u22121\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fnj \u2212 fnj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p + 2p\u22121(\u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fng\u3009\u2223\u2223p + \u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fng+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p)\n+ 2p\u22121\n( k\u2211\nj=g+1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fnj\u3009\u2223\u2223p + \u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fnj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p)\n6 2p\u22121\n(g\u22121\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fnj \u2212 fnj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p + \u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fng\u3009\u2223\u2223p)+ 2p k+1\u2211\nj=g+1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fnj\u3009\u2223\u2223p.\nWe estimate the two terms on the right-hand side of this inequality separately. Firstly, the\nset B := {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < ng < LNh + 1} is permissible because g 6 k 6 n1, and therefore\nwe have\ng\u22121\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fnj \u2212 fnj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p + \u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fng\u3009\u2223\u2223p = \u03bdp(\u03b2hvh, B)p 6 \u2016\u03b2hvh\u2016pVp = |\u03b2h|p 6 \u2016x\u2016pc0 .\nSecondly, we observe that\nk+1\u2211\nj=g+1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fnj\u3009\u2223\u2223p 6 (k \u2212 g + 1) sup{\u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fn\u3009\u2223\u2223p : n > ng+1}\n6 k sup\n{\u2223\u2223\u3008Ux, fn\u3009\u2223\u2223p : n > LNh}\n= k sup\n{\n|\u03b2j|p\n\u2223\u2223\u3008vj, fn\u3009\u2223\u2223p : n > LNh , j > h} 6 k \u2016x\u2016pc0(L\u2212 1pNh )p 6 \u2016x\u2016pc0\nbecause k 6 n1 6 LNh . Hence we conclude that\n\u03bdp(Ux,A)\np 6 2p\u22121\u2016x\u2016pc0 + 2p \u2016x\u2016pc0 = 3 \u00b7 2p\u22121\u2016x\u2016pc0 ,\nand this, together with (5.7), shows that the second inequality in (5.6) is satisfied with\nC2 := (3 \u00b7 2p\u22121)\n1\np = 3\n1\np \u00b7 21\u2212 1p . 2\nProof of Theorem 5.2. LetX be a closed, infinite-dimensional subspace of Vp. By a theorem\nof Bessaga and Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski (see [7], or [27, Proposition 1.a.11] for an exposition), X contains\na sequence (xn)n\u2208N which is equivalent to a block basic sequence (un)n\u2208N of the standard\nbasis for Vp. Lemma 5.3 implies that (un)n\u2208N has a block basic sequence (vn)n\u2208N which is\nequivalent to the standard unit vector basis for c0. Since (un)n\u2208N is equivalent to (xn)n\u2208N,\n(vn)n\u2208N is equivalent to a block basic sequence of (xn)n\u2208N, say (yn)n\u2208N, and consequently\nwe have\nX \u2287 span {xn : n \u2208 N} \u2287 span {yn : n \u2208 N} \u223c= span {vn : n \u2208 N} \u223c= c0,\nas desired. 2\n25\n5.4 Corollary. For each p > 1, the pth Schreier space Sp is c0-saturated.\nProof. This is immediate from the fact that Vp contains a subspace isomorphic to Sp (see\nProposition 4.10). 2\n5.5 Remark. (i) Corollary 5.4 is known in the case p = 1 (e.g., see [15]).\n(ii) Proposition 2.3, which is the counterpart of Theorem 5.2 and Corollary 5.4 for\nJames spaces, appears to be formally stronger as it states that every closed, infinite-\ndimensional subspace of Jp contains a complemented subspace which is isomorphic\nto `p; however, Sobczyk\u2019s Theorem (e.g., see [27, Theorem 2.f.5]) implies that every\nsubspace of Vp or Sp (or any other separable Banach space) which is isomorphic to c0\nis complemented.\n(iii) Corollary 5.4 implies that `1 does not embed in Sp for each p > 1. Since (en)n\u2208N is an\nunconditional basis for Sp, a well-known theorem of James [22] shows that (en)n\u2208N is\nshrinking, thus giving an alternative proof of Proposition 3.10 and Corollary 3.12.\n5.6 Corollary. For each p > 1, the pth unrestricted Schreier space Zp contains a sub-\nspace which is isomorphic to `\u221e; the same is true for the pth unrestricted James\u2013Schreier\nspace Wp.\nProof. Since Sp contains a subspace which is isomorphic to c0, its bidual S \u2032\u2032p contains\na subspace which is isomorphic to c\u2032\u20320 \u223c= `\u221e; this proves the first clause because Zp \u223c= S \u2032\u2032p\nby \u00a73.14. The second follows immediately from this because Proposition 4.5 implies thatWp\ncontains a subspace which is isomorphic to Zp. 2\n5.7 Definition. Two infinite-dimensional Banach spacesX and Y are totally incomparable\nif no closed, infinite-dimensional subspace of X is isomorphic to a subspace of Y .\nAny two distinct spaces from the family {`p : 1 6 p <\u221e} \u222a {c0} are totally incompa-\nrable, as is well-known (e.g., see [27, p. 54]).\n5.8 Lemma. Let X1, X2, Y1, and Y2 be infinite-dimensional Banach spaces, and suppose\nthat Xj is Yj-saturated for j = 1, 2 and that Y1 and Y2 are totally incomparable. Then X1\nand X2 are totally incomparable.\nProof. Assume towards a contradiction that E is a closed, infinite-dimensional subspace\nof X1 which is isomorphic to a subspace of X2. Then E contains a subspace F which is\nisomorphic to Y1. Since F is isomorphic to a subspace of X2, it contains a subspace which\nis isomorphic to Y2, contradicting that Y1 and Y2 are totally incomparable. 2\n5.9 Corollary. Let p, q > 1. Then:\n(i) `p and Sq are totally incomparable;\n(ii) `p and Vq are totally incomparable;\n26\n(iii) Jp and Sq are totally incomparable;\n(iv) Jp and Vq are totally incomparable.\nProof. We apply Lemma 5.8 with X1 := `p or X1 := Jp, X2 := Sq or X2 := Vq, and Y1 := `p\nand Y2 := c0. As mentioned above, Y1 and Y2 are totally incomparable, while [27, Proposi-\ntion 2.a.2], Proposition 2.3, Corollary 5.4, and Theorem 5.2 imply that Xj is Yj-saturated\nfor j = 1, 2. 2\nEvidence from other sequence spaces suggests that no two Schreier spaces with distinct\nindices should be isomorphic and, likewise, no two James\u2013Schreier spaces with distinct\nindices should be isomorphic. We have, unfortunately, been unable to verify any of these\nconjectures, so the following question is open.\n5.10 Question. Is it true that Sp 6\u223c= Sq and Vp 6\u223c= Vq whenever 1 6 p < q <\u221e?\nNote added in proof. Question 5.10 has been answered in the positive; see [10].\n6 The pth James\u2013Schreier space does not embed in a\nBanach space with an unconditional basis for p > 1\nThe aim of this section is to prove the result stated in the title; in particular, this will\nimply that, for p > 1, the pth James\u2013Schreier space does not embed in any of the Schreier\nspaces.\nOur proof relies on the following technical notion which was originally introduced by\nPe\u0142czy\u0144ski [32] who, motivated by work of Orlicz, was studying the relationship between\nweak completeness and weak unconditional convergence of series in Banach spaces.\n6.1 Definition. A Banach spaceX has Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski\u2019s property (u) if, for every weak Cauchy\nsequence (xn)n\u2208N in X, there is a sequence (yn)n\u2208N in X such that\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008yn, f\u3009\u2223\u2223 <\u221e and \u2329xn \u2212 n\u2211\nj=1\nyj, f\n\u232a\n\u2192 0 as n\u2192\u221e (f \u2208 X \u2032). (6.1)\nThe reason that this notion is relevant for our purposes is immediately explained by\nparts (i) and (ii) of the following result, which was stated in [32].\n6.2 Theorem. (Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski.)\n(i) Every Banach space with an unconditional basis has Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski\u2019s property (u).\n(ii) Every closed subspace of a Banach space with Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski\u2019s property (u) has Pe\u0142czy\u0144-\nski\u2019s property (u).\n(iii) The James space J2 does not have Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski\u2019s property (u).\n27\nDetailed proofs of all three parts of Theorem 6.2 are given in [1, Section 3.5]. A more\ngeneral statement than Theorem 6.2(i) can be found in [28, Proposition 1.c.2], namely:\nevery order continuous Banach lattice has Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski\u2019s property (u).\nWe can now state the main result of this section, which is the counterpart of Theo-\nrem 6.2(iii) for James\u2013Schreier spaces.\n6.3 Theorem. For each p > 1, the pth James\u2013Schreier space Vp does not have Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski\u2019s\nproperty (u).\nThe proof of Theorem 6.3 goes via two lemmas. The first is easy, so we omit its proof.\n6.4 Lemma. Let X be a Banach space with a shrinking basis (bn)n\u2208N, and let (b\u2032m)m\u2208N\nbe the associated biorthogonal functionals. A sequence (xn)n\u2208N in X is a weak Cauchy\nsequence if and only if (xn)n\u2208N is bounded and the sequence\n(\u3008xn, b\u2032m\u3009)n\u2208N converges for\neach m \u2208 N.\n6.5 Lemma. Let p > 1, and suppose that (yn)n\u2208N is a sequence in Vp such that\u2329\n\u03c7[1,n] \u2212\nn\u2211\nj=1\nyj, fm\n\u232a\n\u2192 0 as n\u2192\u221e (m \u2208 N). (6.2)\nThen the series\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008yn, f\u3009\u2223\u2223 diverges for some f \u2208 V \u2032p .\nBefore we engage with the proof of Lemma 6.5, let us see how these two lemmas combine\nto establish our main result.\nProof of Theorem 6.3. Assume towards a contradiction that Vp has Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski\u2019s prop-\nerty (u), and let xn := \u03c7[1,n] for each n \u2208 N. Since p > 1, the standard basis for Vp is\nshrinking, so Lemma 6.4 implies that (xn)n\u2208N is a weak Cauchy sequence in Vp. Then, by\nassumption, we can choose a sequence (yn)n\u2208N in Vp which satisfies (6.1). This, however,\ncontradicts Lemma 6.5. 2\n6.6 Remark. Our proof of Theorem 6.3, like that of Theorem 6.2(iii) given in [1], starts\nby taking xn := \u03c7[1,n] and then proceeds by arguing that there is no sequence (yn)n\u2208N which\nsatisfies (6.1). This follows quite easily for J2 from general structure theorems because no\nsubspace of J2 is isomorphic to c0. As we saw in Section 5, this is no longer true for Vp,\nand so a different and, as it turns out, more delicate, argument is required.\nThe following family of functionals will play a key role in the proof of Lemma 6.5.\n6.7 Definition. Given a strictly increasing mapping \u03c3 : N \u2192 N, we associate with it the\nalternating harmonic functional\n\u03be\u03c3 : x 7\u2192\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n(\u22121)n\nn\n\u3008x, f\u03c3(n)\u3009, c00 \u2192 K. (6.3)\n28\nAs one might guess, our interest in \u03be\u03c3 stems from the fact that it extends to a bounded\nfunctional on Vp. This can be conveniently proved using the following lemma which, roughly\nspeaking, states that in order to establish the boundedness of a functional on Vp, it suf-\nfices to consider its action on finite, positive vectors. To make this statement precise, we\nintroduce the notation c+00 for the positive cone of c00, that is,\nc+00 :=\n{ n\u2211\nj=1\n\u03b1jej : n \u2208 N, \u03b11, . . . , \u03b1n \u2208 [0,\u221e)\n}\n.\n6.8 Lemma. Let p > 1, let f be a functional on c00, and suppose that there is a constant\nC > 0 such that\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, f\u3009\u2223\u2223 6 C\u2016x\u2016Vp for each x \u2208 c+00. Then f extends uniquely to a bounded\nfunctional on Vp, and the extension has norm at most 4C.\nProof. Given x \u2208 c00, let x+ :=\n(\nmax{Re\u3008x, fn\u3009, 0}\n)\nn\u2208N \u2208 c+00. Then, for each permissible\nsubset A = {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk+1} of N, we have\n\u2016x\u2016pVp >\nk\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, fnj \u2212 fnj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p > k\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223Re\u3008x, fnj\u3009 \u2212 Re\u3008x, fnj+1\u3009\u2223\u2223p\n>\nk\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223max{Re\u3008x, fnj\u3009, 0} \u2212max{Re\u3008x, fnj+1\u3009, 0}\u2223\u2223p = \u03bdp(x+, A)p, (6.4)\nwhere the final inequality is an immediate consequence of the elementary estimate\n|\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2| > \u2223\u2223max{\u03b1, 0} \u2212max{\u03b2, 0}\u2223\u2223 (\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 R).\nTaking the supremum over all permissible sets A in (6.4), we obtain \u2016x\u2016Vp > \u2016x+\u2016Vp .\nNow define x\u2212 := (\u2212x)+, xi+ := (\u2212ix)+, and xi\u2212 := (ix)+. (Strictly speaking, the\nlatter two definitions make sense only if the scalar field is C; if K = R, let xi\u00b1 := 0, no\nmatter what x is.) Then we have x = x+\u2212x\u2212+ i(xi+\u2212xi\u2212), where x\u00b1, xi\u00b1 \u2208 c+00, and each\nof them has James\u2013Schreier norm at most \u2016x\u2016Vp by the first part of the proof. Thus the\nassumption on f implies that\u2223\u2223\u3008x, f\u3009\u2223\u2223 6 \u2223\u2223\u3008x+, f\u3009\u2223\u2223+ \u2223\u2223\u3008x\u2212, f\u3009\u2223\u2223+ \u2223\u2223\u3008xi+, f\u3009\u2223\u2223+ \u2223\u2223\u3008xi\u2212, f\u3009\u2223\u2223 6 4C\u2016x\u2016Vp ,\nand the result follows from the density of c00 in Vp. 2\n6.9 Lemma. For each p > 1 and each strictly increasing mapping \u03c3 : N \u2192 N, the func-\ntional \u03be\u03c3 given by (6.3) extends uniquely to a bounded functional on Vp of norm at most\n4 \u00b7 2 1p (2 1p \u2212 1)\u22121.\nProof. We begin with an elementary observation for later reference:\nn\u2211\nj=1\n|\u03b1j| 6 n1\u2212\n1\np\n( n\u2211\nj=1\n|\u03b1j|p\n) 1\np\n(n \u2208 N, \u03b11, . . . , \u03b1n \u2208 K); (6.5)\n29\nindeed, this inequality is trivial for p = 1, whereas for p > 1, application of H\u00f6lder\u2019s\ninequality to the n-tuples (1, 1, . . . , 1) and (\u03b11, \u03b12, . . . , \u03b1n) gives the required estimate. We\nnote in passing that (4.1) is a special case of (6.5) corresponding to n = 2.\nFor each m \u2208 N, let Am := N \u2229 [2m \u2212 1, 2m+1 \u2212 2]; this is a permissible set because\ncardAm = 2\nm = minAm + 1, and therefore, as \u03c3 is increasing, \u03c3(Am) is also permissible.\nNow, for given x \u2208 c+00, choose N \u2208 N such that \u3008x, f\u03c3(n)\u3009 = 0 whenever n > 2(2N \u2212 1).\nThen we have\n\u3008x, \u03be\u03c3\u3009 =\n2(2N\u22121)\u2211\nn=1\n(\u22121)n\nn\n\u3008x, f\u03c3(n)\u3009 =\n2N\u22121\u2211\nn=1\n(\n\u2212\u3008x, f\u03c3(2n\u22121)\u3009\n2n\u2212 1 +\n\u3008x, f\u03c3(2n)\u3009\n2n\n)\n, (6.6)\nwhich is real because x \u2208 c+00; the following estimates yield an upper bound:\n\u3008x, \u03be\u03c3\u3009 6\n2N\u22121\u2211\nn=1\n\u3008x, f\u03c3(2n) \u2212 f\u03c3(2n\u22121)\u3009\n2n\n6\nN\u2211\nm=1\n( 2m\u22121\u2211\nn=2m\u22121\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, f\u03c3(2n\u22121) \u2212 f\u03c3(2n)\u3009\u2223\u2223\n2m\n)\n6\nN\u2211\nm=1\n1\n2m\n2m+1\u22123\u2211\nj=2m\u22121\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, f\u03c3(j) \u2212 f\u03c3(j+1)\u3009\u2223\u2223\n6\nby (6.5)\nN\u2211\nm=1\n(2m \u2212 1)1\u2212 1p\n2m\n(2m+1\u22123\u2211\nj=2m\u22121\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, f\u03c3(j) \u2212 f\u03c3(j+1)\u3009\u2223\u2223p) 1p\n=\nN\u2211\nm=1\n(2m \u2212 1)1\u2212 1p\n2m\n\u03bdp\n(\nx, \u03c3(Am)\n)\n6\nN\u2211\nm=1\n(2m)\u2212\n1\np \u2016x\u2016Vp 6\n\u2016x\u2016Vp\n2\n1\np \u2212 1\nby summation of the geometric progression.\nOn the other hand, pairing up neighbouring terms differently in (6.6), we obtain a lower\nbound:\n\u3008x, \u03be\u03c3\u3009 = \u2212\u3008x, f\u03c3(1)\u3009+\n2N\u22121\u2211\nn=1\n(\u3008x, f\u03c3(2n)\u3009\n2n\n\u2212 \u3008x, f\u03c3(2n+1)\u3009\n2n+ 1\n)\n> \u2212\u2016x\u2016Vp +\n2N\u22121\u2211\nn=1\n\u3008x, f\u03c3(2n) \u2212 f\u03c3(2n+1)\u3009\n2n\n> \u22122\n1\np\u2016x\u2016Vp\n2\n1\np \u2212 1\n,\nwhere the final inequality follows from estimates very similar to those used in the calculation\nabove.\nCombining the upper and lower bound, we obtain\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, \u03be\u03c3\u3009\u2223\u2223 6 2 1p (2 1p \u2212 1)\u22121\u2016x\u2016Vp for\neach x \u2208 c+00, and hence Lemma 6.8 gives the result. 2\n6.10 Remark. It would suffice to prove Lemma 6.9 for \u03c3 = \u03b9 (the identity mapping on N)\nbecause \u03be\u03c3 = \u039b\u2032\u03c3\u03be\u03b9, where \u039b\u03c3 is the left shift defined in (3.2). The proof of the boundedness\nof \u03be\u03b9 is not, however, significantly simpler than the general proof given above.\n30\nWe are now ready to prove Lemma 6.5.\nProof of Lemma 6.5. We split in two cases. Suppose first that, for some k \u2208 N and \u03b5 > 0,\nwe have\n\u2211\u221e\nj=n\n\u2223\u2223\u3008yj, fk\u3009\u2223\u2223 > \u03b5 for each n \u2208 N. Then the series \u2211\u221ej=1\u2223\u2223\u3008yj, fk\u3009\u2223\u2223 diverges, so in\nthis case we can simply take f := fk \u2208 V \u2032p .\nOtherwise, for each k \u2208 N and \u03b5 > 0, we can find n \u2208 N such that\n\u221e\u2211\nj=n\n\u2223\u2223\u3008yj, fk\u3009\u2223\u2223 6 \u03b5. (6.7)\nIn this case our strategy is to construct a strictly increasing mapping \u03c3 : N\u2192 N such that\nthe series\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008yn, \u03be\u03c3\u3009\u2223\u2223 diverges. Fix a summable, decreasing sequence (\u03b5m)m\u2208N in (0,\u221e).\nBy induction, we choose integers 0 6 N0 < \u03c3(0) 6 N1 < \u03c3(1) 6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 such that the following\nthree conditions are satisfied:\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 n\u2211\nj=1\n\u3008yj, f\u03c3(m\u22121)\u3009\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 > 1\u2212 \u03b5m (m \u2208 N, n > Nm); (6.8)\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225(IVp \u2212 Pk)\u2211\nj\u2208A\nyj\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\nVp\n6 \u03b5m\n(\nm \u2208 N, k > \u03c3(m)\u2212 1, A \u2286 [1, Nm] \u2229 N\n)\n; (6.9)\n\u221e\u2211\nj=Nm+1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008yj, f\u03c3(k)\u3009\u2223\u2223 6 k\u03b5m\nm\u2212 1 (m > 2, 1 6 k < m). (6.10)\nTo start the induction, we observe that (6.8)\u2013(6.10) are vacuous for m = 0, so we can\nsimply take N0 := 0 and \u03c3(0) := 1. Now let ` \u2208 N, and assume inductively that integers\n0 6 N0 < \u03c3(0) 6 N1 < \u03c3(1) 6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 6 N`\u22121 < \u03c3(` \u2212 1) have been chosen such that (6.8)\u2013\n(6.10) are satisfied for each m 6 ` \u2212 1. For n > \u03c3(` \u2212 1), our assumption (6.2) implies\nthat\n1\u2212\nn\u2211\nj=1\n\u3008yj, f\u03c3(`\u22121)\u3009 =\n\u2329\n\u03c7[1,n] \u2212\nn\u2211\nj=1\nyj, f\u03c3(`\u22121)\n\u232a\n\u2192 0 as n\u2192\u221e,\nso we can find N \u2032` > \u03c3(`\u2212 1) such that (6.8) is satisfied for m = ` and each n > N \u2032`. In the\ncase where ` > 2, `\u2212 1 applications of (6.7) yield a number N \u2032\u2032` \u2208 N such that\n\u221e\u2211\nj=N \u2032\u2032` +1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008yj, f\u03c3(k)\u3009\u2223\u2223 6 k\u03b5`\n`\u2212 1\n(\nk \u2208 {1, . . . , `\u2212 1}).\nThus (6.8) and (6.10) will both be satisfied for each m 6 ` provided that we define\nN` :=\n{\nN \u2032` if ` = 1,\nmax{N \u2032`, N \u2032\u2032` } otherwise.\nSince there are only finitely many subsets of [1, N`]\u2229N, and\n\u2225\u2225(IVp\u2212Pk)x\u2016Vp \u2192 0 as k \u2192\u221e\nfor each x \u2208 Vp because (en)n\u2208N is a basis for Vp, we can find \u03c3(`) > N` such that (6.9) is\nsatisfied for m = `, and hence the induction continues.\n31\nNow let zm :=\n\u2211Nm+1\nj=Nm+1\nyj \u2208 Vp for each m \u2208 N; we then have\n\u221e\u2211\nm=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008ym, \u03be\u03c3\u3009\u2223\u2223 > \u221e\u2211\nm=1\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 Nm+1\u2211\nj=Nm+1\n\u3008yj, \u03be\u03c3\u3009\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u221e\u2211\nm=1\n\u2223\u2223\u3008zm, \u03be\u03c3\u3009\u2223\u2223.
