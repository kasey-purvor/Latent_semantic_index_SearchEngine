INTRODUCTION \nFuture mobile applications with ubiquitous location \nservices will present a wealth of opportunities for location \nbased services. One example of this which offers new \ndimensions in video games are the location based games. \nThese games present a mixed reality world for the player \nincorporating their physical location and the objects within \nthat location into the virtual game world.  \nCurrent location based applications and games use either \none or a combination of location technologies depending \nupon the nature and demand of the application. These \nlocation technologies can vary both in terms of complexity \nand accuracy and come in a variety of forms such as Cell \nID, Time Difference of Arrival or Enhanced Observed Time \nDifference to satellite dependent such as GPS or Assisted \nGPS [1].  With the exception of Cell ID all these methods \nuse signal measurements to estimate the position of the \nmobile users relative to the system infrastructure. An \nalternative approach is to ascertain location from the user\u2019s \ninteraction with objects of known location where their \nposition can then be implied. The interaction could be \nwithin a physical area using technologies such as Bluetooth \n[2] or down to object level using one of the various forms of \ntwo dimensional bar codes such as QR codes [3]. All the \ntwo dimensional bar code systems use a phone with an on-\nboard camera to either decode the code on the phone or \nthrough interaction with an online database. With major \nphone manufactures putting Radio Frequency Identification \n(RFID) readers onto phones [4] and the advent of Near \nField Communications (NFC), RFID tags offer an \nalternative approach that are both simpler to read and \nrequires less power drain on the mobile phone battery than \nthe use of a camera.      \nThe vast majority of location based games thus far have \neither used Cell-ID [5] [6] or phones equipped with GPS [7] \nand there is only one example of a game utilizing two \ndimensional bar codes [8]. The game presented in this paper \nis a new version of legendary video game PACMAN played \nby human players around an actual location using RFID \nenabled mobile phones. There have been earlier attempts to \nbring this game to life such as PacManhattan [9] which was \nplayed on streets of Manhattan and Virtual PacMan which \nis being developed in Singapore [10]. The former merely \nuses a phone to relay the player\u2019s position to other players \nwho enter this position into an on-line game while latter \nuses a highly elaborate and expensive combination of GPS, \nwearable computers, Wi-fi, Bluetooth, and other sensors. \nThe game presented in this paper is simpler more effective \nand represents a form of mobile phone location based game \nthat could be deployed in any location to a mass market of \nusers with minimal cost. It also illustrates that RFID will \noffer many new and exciting possibilities to mobile \napplication developers. \nII. SYSTEM OVERVIEW AND DESIGN \nPACLAN is a novel version of the video game \nPACMAN in which human players play the game on a \nmaze based on Lancaster University campus. Figure 1 \nshows the map of Alexandra Park which is the pedestrian \narea of campus where the game is played and the screen \nshot taken from the phone of the corresponding maze. \n      \nFigure 1: Actual Map and Game Maze \n \nTo play the game the Paclan player collects pills using \nthe mobile which are in the form of colored discs containing \nRFID tags placed around the maze. Four other players take \nthe role of the ghosts who attempt to hunt down the Paclan. \nA Java application, running on a mobile phone connects \nPaclan and the Ghosts to a central game server using GPRS \nas shown in figure 2.  \nPacLan Ghost\nServer\nDatabase\nGPRS GPRS\nRFID\nTag\nRFID\nTag\n \nFigure 2: PACLAN networking overview \n0-7803-9459-3\/06\/$20.00 \u00a42006 IEEE  459 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on January 7, 2009 at 10:20 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\n The server relays to Paclan his current position and that \nof the ghosts based on the pills he has collected. The pills \ncan also be used by the ghosts, not to gain points, but to \nobtain Paclan\u2019s last known position which will only be \nupdated when they interact with another pill. The ghosts \n\u2018kill\u2019 Paclan by detecting him via RFID on the clothing (or \ncostume). Similarly when Paclan collects a power pill he is \nthen able to kill the ghosts using the same RFID detection \nprocess. Dead ghosts must then return to the central point to \nbe reactivated into the game. Points are allocated on pills \ncollected and ghosts killed. The central point is controlled \nby the server and a special RFID point to ensure ghosts \nremain immobile until released. \nThe client applications for PacLan and Ghosts handle \nthe game information differently and in the following \nparagraphs we will provide more detail of these \nimplementations. Figure 3 shows the application flow \ndiagram for the Paclan character.  \n \nCheck Tag\nPacLan\nMobile Client\nRMS\nAlert Tag already\nread\nNew\nOld\nGet Tag \nProperty\nInitiate Timer for \nPower Pill\nSend\/Receive\nUpdates\nPallet\/Kill\nPower Pill\nRefresh Display\nTag \nInformation\nServer \nParse received Data\nTag ID\/\nTimer Info\nDatabase\nUpdate \nDatabase\nGhost Locations\n \nFigure 3: Application flow for PacLan Mobile Client \n \nThe application uses J2ME\u2019s persistent storage \nfunctionality to hold information about each tag collected \nand if the tag has been collected previously the player is \nalerted. For new tags the client must ascertain the type \n(general pill, power pill, or kill pill) initiates the required \naction such as updating points or initializing timers for \npower pill etc. The tag identification along with timer \ninformation, if required, is sent to the central server over \nGPRS, as indicated by the dotted lines in the diagram.  \nOne of the major differences for the Ghost client, as \nshown in figure 4, is in the way the application handles the \ntag data. The Ghost application simply looks up the tag type \nand contacts the server to get new updates. In case of a \ngeneral pill the server returns the current location of PacLan \nand color codes Paclan on display from yellow to red if \nPaclan possesses a power pill. Time out for power pill is \nonly achieved by the ghosts reading a number of RFID tags. \nThis game play forces ghosts to read the RFID tags more \noften and prevents Ghosts from trying to ambush Paclan by \nnot up-dating their position.   \nServer uses PHP to handle information from both \nclients. Received information is updated in the database and \nlast tag read by PacLan or ghost is returned to respective \nclients.  \n \nGhost\nMobile Client\nRMS\nGet Tag \nProperty\nSend\/Receive\nUpdates\nPallet\/Kill\nColor code to\nShow power pill status\nTag \nInformation\nServer \nParse received Data\nTag ID\/\nTimer Info\nDatabase\nUpdate \nDatabase\nPac-Lan Location\/\nPower pill time out\nRefresh Display\n \nFigure 4: Application Architecture for Ghost Mobile Client \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nExtensive testing will be conducted over the fall of 2005 \nand in the overall paper we will not only provide greater \ndetail on the implementation of the system but also on the \nexperiences of a large numbers of players. This novel \napplication and our operational experience should provide a \nvaluable insight to the potential uses of RFID in \nconjunction with mobile phones. \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] E. Lin and K.
