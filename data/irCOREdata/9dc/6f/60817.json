Thanks to the international leadership \nof the European Union, the United Nations conference in Bali \nin December 2007 paved the way for a new global agreement \nto tackle climate change. Negotiating a new agreement will be \na long, tough process as individual nations seek ways to reduce \ntheir greenhouse gas emissions without compromising econom-\nic growth. In international negotiations such as these, the first \nstep to success is for all parties to agree on the basic premises: \nthe need for action and the scientific evidence which identifies \nthe problem and presents the best solution. Only arguments \nbased on sound scientific evidence will carry weight.\nIn struggling to combat climate change by reducing carbon \nemissions we are effectively attempting to manage the future \ncarbon balance of the planet. To do that we must have accurate \ndata, not just on the net amount of carbon in the atmosphere, \nbut also on the sources and sinks of carbon at various scales. \nThe task of compiling statistics on the continental and ocean \ncarbon balance is extremely demanding and requires an inte-\ngrated approach where scientists from different disciplines work \ntogether at European and international levels. That is why in \nthe 6th framework programme for research two large-scale inte-\ngrated projects, CarboEurope and CarboOcean, were funded by \nthe Directorate-General for Research (Environment Directorate), \nin order to assess and quantify the carbon balance of European \nterrestrial ecosystems and the Atlantic Ocean, and put the conti-\nnent of Europe into a global perspective. These projects brought \ntogether more than 120 teams of top European scientists who \nare working to provide the data we need and the understanding \nto interpret that data. Research results will give us the evidence \nwe need to guide future policymaking. Furthermore, additional \nprojects targeting more specific scientific questions in relation \nto the carbon balance in Europe and beyond have also been \nimplemented (NitroEurope, CarboAfrica and CarboNorth). \nGiven its important socio-economic and policy implications, re-\nsearch on the carbon cycle remains a key priority under the 7th \nframework programme for research and technological develop-\nment.\nThis publication provides a comprehensive overview of scientific \nresults and their policy implications, as emerged from EU-fund-\ned integrated research actions on the carbon cycle, and under-\nlines existing knowledge gaps and future research priorities. It \nwill therefore be of particular interest and value to a wide range \nof stakeholders including policymakers, the scientific commu-\nnity and the general public. It also represents an important \ncontribution to the ongoing debate on climate change and the \ngreenhouse gas balance in Europe and beyond. \n \n  Jos\u00e9 Manuel Silva Rodr\u00edguez\n  Director-General of the\n  Directorate-General for Research\n6I Executive Summary .............................................................. 9\n  Overview .................................................................... 9\n  CarboEurope-IP ..........................................................10\n  CarboOcean-IP ...........................................................11\nII Introduction to the Global Carbon Cycle ................................12\nIII The Challenge ..................................................................14\nIV The CarboEurope-IP Project ................................................15\n 1  The CarboEurope-IP Approach .......................................16\n 2  The Role of Soil ..........................................................18\n 3  Forests and Farms .......................................................24\n 3.1 Forests ......................................................................24\n 3.2 Croplands ..................................................................30\n 3.3 Grasslands .................................................................31\n 3.4 Land-use Change ........................................................36\n 4  Peatland ...................................................................38\n 5  The Impact of Added Nitrogen and Management ..............40\n 5.1  Effect of nitrogen deposition ........................................40\n 5.2  Effects of forest management .......................................41\n 6  Extreme Events ..........................................................42\n 7  The Atmospheric Approach ...........................................45\n 7.1  Modeling the Continental Scale European Ecosystem \n  Carbon Balance ..........................................................45\n 7.2  The CarboEurope Regional Experiment ............................46\n 7.3  CO2 Concentration and Fluxes .......................................50\n 7.4  Fossil Fuel Emissions ...................................................54\n 8  The Carbon Balance of Europe.......................................57\n 9  International Perspective .............................................62\n 10 Demonstration, Training and Young Scientists .................63\n 10.1  Demonstration Activities..............................................63\n 10.2  Training and Outreach .................................................66\n 10.3 Young Scientist Award .................................................68\n 11  Strategy and Future Priorities .......................................69\n 12 CarboEurope-IP History ...............................................72\n 12  Cited Literature ..........................................................73\nTable of contents\n7V The CarboOcean Project .......................................................79\n 1 CarboOcean-IP -

At \nthis moment the marine and terrestrial carbon cycles are able to \npartially compensate for the man-made CO2 emissions through \ncarbon uptake. In future the land sink may turn into a carbon \nsource to the atmosphere due to land-use, land-use change, \nclimatic change and rising atmospheric CO2 levels. Globally av-\neraged, the ocean will always act as sink for CO2 emissions to \nthe atmosphere, but the sink strength may change considerably \ndue to climate change, changes in ocean circulation, as well \nas biogeochemical feedback processes to warming and increas-\ning CO2 levels. Therefore, the integrated assessment of carbon \nsources and sinks in relation to the climatic feedback is essen-\ntial for environmental policy. Such an assessment is only pos-\nsible through an integrated approach as successfully carried out \nby CarboEurope-IP and CarboOcean-IP, which will be reported \nin the following.\nI Executive Summary\nOverview\nFig. I.1: Positive forcing and compensation processes of relevance for the European carbon balance as part of the Earth system.\nNorth America North Atlantic\nSouth America,\nAmazon\nAfrica, Sahara,\nCongo\nSouthern Ocean\nEurope\nNorth Sea\nMediterranean\nSiberia\nRiver loads River loads,dust transport\nAbsorption and deep mixing\nof global emissions\nAbsorption and deep mixing\nof global emissions\nforcing\ncompensation\nIncrease of heat and\nfreshwater delivery\nControl of European climate Heat transfer and northward\nextension of agriculture\nAbsorption and deep mixing\nof North American emissions\nContinental shelf pump and\ndeep Gibraltar outflow Absorption of European emissions\n10\nExecutive Summary of the terrestrial carbon balance (CarboEurope-IP)\n\u2022 The land surface of continental Europe (the geographic region between the Atlantic coast and the Ural Mountains) is a carbon sink \nfor CO2 of 300 Tg C yr\n-1 (as indicated by atmospheric and ground-based measurements). The estimated sink has almost doubled since \n2003, mainly due to additional processes understanding. \n\u2022 Including the carbon-equivalents of methane and N2O into the non-fossil fuel carbon balance (100 yr time horizon) reduces the \ncontinental sink by about 70% to 81 Tg C-CO2eq yr\n-1; and it makes the EU-25 carbon-neutral or even slightly negative.\n\u2022 About 80% of the continental fossil fuel emissions and about 90% of the EU-25 fossil fuel emissions remain in the atmosphere \nand contribute to global warming. The mitigation potential of the terrestrial vegetation is not realised because of the green-\nhouse gas emissions by intensive agriculture. \n\u2022 Almost 60% of the continental CO2 sink is located outside the EU-25 in eastern Europe, mainly European Russia. The large forest \nsink of eastern Europe is in part compensated by emissions due to peat mining. Including non-CO2 greenhouse gases, the entire \ncontinental sink (100%) is located in eastern Europe. The non-CO2 gases act as the equivalent of a \u201ctoll\u201d (100y time horizon) \ntaken by the nitrogen cycle on the productivity of the biomes. In this case the \u201ctoll\u201d is as high as the productivity. \n\u2022 Grasslands sequester more carbon in soils than forests (57 versus 20 g C m-2 yr-1). Even if the emissions of non-CO2 gases are \nincluded, the carbon sequestration in grassland soils remains higher than in forests. Croplands are a source of CO2 which signifi-\ncantly increases when non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions are included. Managed peat-lands are an additional major source.\n\u2022 Forests remain the most efficient land-use type for carbon sequestration (74 g C m-2 yr-1) when the increment in woody biomass \nis included. However, this sink is the result of atmospheric nitrogen deposition. The forest carbon sink is similar in magnitude \nto the CO2-equivalent N2O emissions from agriculture.\n\u2022 The total continental CO2-carbon sink is 20% of the fossil fuel emissions of continental Europe (1600 Tg C yr\n-1) and 13% of the fossil \nfuel emission of the EU-25 in 2005 (1060 Tg C yr-1). The terrestrial CO2 sink is only 17% of the continental total greenhouse gas \nemissions (about 1700 Tg C-CO2eq yr\n-1), and only 11% of the EU-25 total greenhouse gas emissions (about 1100 Tg C-CO2eq yr\n-1).\n\u2022 The uncertainty in the magnitude of the terrestrial sink remains high. This is a consequence of the heterogenous landscape of \nEurope, and the diversity of management practices at small scale.\n\u2022 The seasonal and inter-annual variation in several key processes that determine the carbon sink of Europe is large. In the dry year \nof 2003, the terrestrial sink for CO2 sequestration failed. The carbon losses were equal to five years of carbon sequestration.\n\u2022 CarboEurope has successfully pioneered the simultaneous application of the bottom-up and the top-down approaches at the \ncontinental scale. The close match found between the two estimates gives major confidence to the result. It points at the urgent \nneed for an Integrated Carbon Observing System, ICOS, across Europe.\nAdditional findings and achievements\n\u2022 The new approach adopted by CarboEurope-IP was to evaluate each source and sink by estimating each value through both a top-\ndown and a bottom up assessment. This has improved the quantification of the carbon balance and decreased the uncertainty \nassociated with each value.\n\u2022 Soils are the ultimate sink for carbon, but can also be a source of carbon if not managed properly. CarboEurope-IP has set up a \nnetwork of observation sites to verify changes in soil carbon during the commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.\n\u2022 A regional experiment has demonstrated the complexity of the interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere. Progress \nhas been made at quantifying the regional scale carbon sink from regional atmospheric observations and the uncertainty involved.\n\u2022 Not only climate extremes of drought but also storms and associated insect damage can substantially harm the sink and affect \nthe emissions of non-CO2 gases.\n\u2022 Despite regular harvesting European forests have been a sink of carbon since the 1950s. This is a result of forest management \npractice, and of the forest age structure. Increased age will bring these forests closer to harvest. In addition, the demand for \npulp or bioenergy may increase the demand for biomass. If so, the forest sector may become a carbon source in future. \n\u2022 CarboEurope has shown that old-growth forests continue to be a carbon sink.\n\u2022 Contrary to earlier assessments, European agriculture, both arable and animal husbandry, is only a minor source of CO2-carbon, \nbut a major source for non-CO2 greenhouse gases.\n\u2022 As a result of management peat-lands, even though of small area, create hotspots of greenhouse gas emissions, despite the fact \nthat management is possible with reduced emissions.\n\u2022 Deposition of active nitrogen from the atmosphere, originating from human activities, has increased carbon sequestration across \nEurope, but the associated emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases appear to cancel out this carbon gain.\nI Executive Summary\nCarboEurope-IP\n11\nI Executive Summary\nCarboOcean-IP\nExecutive summary of the marine carbon balance (CarboOcean-IP)\n\u201cCarboOcean-IP is quantifying the marine carbon sources and sinks\u201d\nCarboOcean is currently in its fourth year of an entire project duration of 5 years. Therefore, \ndata and model evaluation are still under way and not yet finished. \nMain findings:\n\u2022 The highest water column inventories of man-made CO2 exist in the northern North At-\nlantic close to the areas of deep-water formation. The Southern water column contains \nless human-induced CO2 than in the North Atlantic, but the volume of the oceanic region \nis much larger. Global marine CO2 uptake for year 2000 according to global Earth system \nmodels amounts to about 2.3 Gt C per year from a fossil fuel emission of about 7 Gt C yr-1 \nin year 2000.\n\u2022 A prototype of an Atlantic carbon observing system has been established through the use \nof Voluntary Observing Ships equipped with high-precision automated CO2 sensors. The \nNorth Atlantic air-sea carbon flux can now be determined on a monthly-to-seasonal basis \nwith unprecedented accuracy with 10\u00b0 resolution in latitude and longitude. The North \nAtlantic carbon sink has varied during the past 15 years between 200 and 470 Tg C yr-1. \nThe marine uptake of CO2 in the North Atlantic region between 20\u00b0N and 65\u00b0N declined \nsince 1994\/95 and increased again since about 2002. It reached a total sink of 320 Tg C \nyr-1 in 2005.\n\u2022 In-situ measurements, ocean modelling, and atmospheric inverse modelling consistently \nindicate a weakening of the Southern Ocean carbon sink in the decade between 1981 and \n2004 by 80 Tg C yr-1 relative to the trend expected from the increase in atmospheric CO2.\n\u2022 The anthropogenic carbon uptake by the oceans is dominated by physical-chemical buff-\nering, but biological and biogeochemical effects are also significant. Ecological impacts \nmay be severe (e.g. through warming and pH changes). Mesocosm experiments suggest an \nincrease in the carbon to nitrogen ratio in phytoplankton at rising CO2 levels which may \nlead to an increase in CO2 uptake. \n\u2022 The future atmospheric CO2 increase will depend on the amount of CO2 emitted, the change \nin ocean circulation, and related biogeochemical processes. Climate model runs which \ninclude an interactive carbon cycle show an accelerated climate change.\n\u2022 European regional seas, including enclosed and semi-enclosed seas, play an important \nrole in the carbon budget, e.g. through the outflow from Mediterranean Sea into the \nNorth Atlantic and the continental shelf pump mechanism of the North Sea. The first \nmeasurement stations for atmospheric CO2 in the Wadden Sea and in the North Sea present \na promising outlook for improved continental scale greenhouse gas budgets.\nAdditional findings and achievements:\n\u2022 Two large observational data base syntheses have been achieved through international \ncollaboration: (a) A worldwide surface ocean CO2 data set (SOCAT), (b) an Atlantic Ocean \nthree-dimensional carbon deep section data set (CARINA). \n\u2022 Contribution to the development and successful testing of a new international approach \ntowards the design of a mooring incorporating a submersible winch capable of producing \nautomated surface to ocean floor carbon and biogeochemistry data (\u201cSeaCycler\u201d). \n\u2022 Development and successful testing of new observational prototype floats for constrain-\ning future ocean interior carbon and oxygen inventory changes (\u201cCARBOOCEAN oxygen \nfloats\u201d).\n\u2022 Development of a state-of-the-art isopycnic coupled physical-biogeochemical ocean cir-\nculation model, which realistically simulates the carbon transport in the ocean\u2019s interior \nalong surfaces of equal density.\n12\nClimate change has become a common thread joining all na-\ntions in a global challenge. Unless this challenge is met, future \ngenerations will inherit the environment of this globe in a very \nmuch worse state than that in which we have received it from \nprevious generations. Urgent measures are needed. We cannot \nexpect any part of the globe to escape the impacts of climate \nchange, but we should not expect the impacts to be equally \ndistributed. Areas that are presently rain forests may dry out, \ndryland areas, which previously could not support crops, may \nbecome arable in the future; estimates of the precise impacts \nare still uncertain, but one thing is clear \u2013 the main suppliers \nof food, the wheat belts of the temperate and Mediterranean \nzones, are under threat.\nClimate change has been initiated by the excessive fossil fuel \nconsumption of industrialised nations. The problem could thus \nbe solved by drastically reducing fossil fuel consumption by \nthese nations, but given the momentum of the global econ-\nomy, this seems highly unlikely. A rapid, drastic cut in carbon \nemissions would have serious implications for the economies \nof the non-industrialised world. In addition, as the wealth of \nthose nations with transitional economies grows to reach the \nstandards of the already industrialised nations, their fossil fuel \nconsumption will continue to increase rather than decrease: a \nprocess driven by political goals. Together, these factors cre-\nate an apparently unstoppable rising tide of atmospheric CO2 \nconcentration. \nAware of this future threat, the United Nations have initiated \nInternational Conventions, e.g. the UN-Framework Convention \non Climate Change, UNFCCC, as part of the acceptance of the \nsustainability philosophy at the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development (UNCED), informally known as \nthe Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June \n1992. The UNFCC has initiated two major protocols, the Mon-\ntreal Protocol, on the reduction of the emissions of Fluoro-Car-\nbon volatile compounds, and the Kyoto Protocol on the reduc-\ntion of emissions of CO2, which includes carbon emissions from \nfossil fuels as well as the emissions from land use. Although at \nthis point not all industrialised nations have signed these two \nprotocols, it is the European Union that has been leading the \npolitical process for action to maintain the world in a viable \nstate.\nThe political process of international negotiation on frameworks \nand conventions has been supported by an unprecedented proc-\ness of international collaboration through the Intergovernmen-\ntal Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC synthesise the \nexisting knowledge to reach a scientific consensus on the oc-\ncurrence of present climate change and the likelihood of future \ndangerous change. The IPCC was honoured for its activities by \nreceiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, which summarised its \nknowledge in the Forth Assessment Report: \u201cThe understanding \nof anthropogenic warming and cooling influences on climate \nhas improved since the TAR [Third IPCC Assessment Report of \n2001], leading to very high confidence that the global aver-\nage net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of \nwarming, with a radiative forcing of +1.6 [+0.6 to +2.4] W m\u20132\u201d.\nThe physics of climate change are in fact fairly simple, although \nthe details are extremely complex. We all talk about the \u201cgreen-\nhouse effect\u201d of atmospheric trace gases, such as CO2, nitro-\ngen oxides, methane, and water vapour, but the analogy is not \nquite correct. In contrast to a real greenhouse, the atmospheric \ngreenhouse effect is not based on the fact, that warm air and \nlong wave radiation is kept under a lid (the glass roof). Rather, \nthe atmosphere acts like an \u201coven\u201d, through a warming of the \n\u201cglass\u201d itself. The reason is, that the vibrations of the molecu-\nlar dipoles of water vapour and CO2 get in resonance with the \ninfrared, thermal radiative energy emitted from the Earth\u2019s sur-\nface. This absorbed energy is converted to kinetic energy of mo-\nlecular motion, resulting in heating of the atmosphere. Without \nthis natural greenhouse effect, the equilibrium temperature of \nthe Earth\u2019s surface would be about 33 \u00baC lower than it was at \npre-industrial times. Increasing the amount of CO2 in the at-\nmosphere increases this \u201cradiative forcing\u201d and raises the equi-\nlibrium temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface beyond the natural \nequilibrium temperature which has existed over the past 10,000 \nyears. This is known as \u201cgreenhouse warming\u201d. \nThe existence of a \u201cgreenhouse\u201d effect and the significance \nof the level of atmospheric CO2 concentration for the Earth\u2019s \nsurface temperature have been known since the work of Tyn-\ndall and Arrhenius in the 19th century. In 1938 Callendar was \nthe first to raise the issue of the potential alteration of the \ngreenhouse effect and climate through human-made CO2. Direct \nregular time series measurements of CO2 in the air started at \nthe South Pole and the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii as \npart of the International Geophysical Year in 1957\/58. These \ntime series measurements have been continued up to now and \nextended to larger networks worldwide. The record of the in-\ncrease of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere has been reli-\nably extended backwards in time by analysis of air trapped in \nAntarctic ice cores. \nSince about 1850 the atmospheric CO2 concentration has been \nincreasing beyond the rate expected from natural phenomena \n(Fig. II.1). Initially this increase was the result of land-use \nchange (largely caused by emissions from deforestation), but \nafter about 1900 fossil fuel emissions started to become a sig-\nnificant component. Since about 1950, fossil fuel emissions \nhave been the dominant cause of increasing CO2. \nThese anthropogenic emissions have been compensated in part \nby uptake in the oceans and in the terrestrial biosphere. Av-\neraged over the whole globe the oceans will always act as a \nII Introduction to the Global Carbon Cycle\n13\nsink for anthropogenic CO2, but as the CO2 concentration rises \nany further addition of CO2 will be buffered less quickly. Latest \noceanographic results reveal, that the ocean carbon sink has a \nconsiderable regional variability. A temporary decrease in the \nuptake strength of the North Atlantic and the Southern Oceans \ndue to climate fluctuations has been identified. In contrast, \nthe biospheric uptake has continued to increase, but exhibits \nhuge oscillations in anti-concert with the atmosphere. These \noscillations are in fact initiated by periodic changes in ocean \ncirculation in the Pacific, the El Ni\u00f1o oscillation. The general \nincrease of the land uptake has been interpreted as being an \nincreasing effect of nitrogen fertilization of the land surface for \ncrop production and un-intentionally by nitrogen oxides, which \nare a by-product of fossil fuel burning.\nFig. II.1 refers to CO2 emissions only. To fully understand cli-\nmate change, the effects of other anthropogenic greenhouse-gas \nemissions, such as di-nitrogen-oxide (N2O) a by-product of the \nnitrogen cycle after fertilizer use, and of methane (CH4), should \nbe included. These emissions are very complex, because natural \nand anthropogenic effects intermingle, and so-called \u201cnatural\u201d \nemissions may be induced by anthropogenic climate change. A \ndeeper understanding of these interactions might be obtained \nby modelling the climate during the glacial periods. However, \nthe 100 ppm glacial-interglacial variations in the atmospheric \nCO2 concentration cannot yet be conclusively explained due to \nthe complexity of the underlying processes. However, it is clear, \nthat during this period the carbon cycle acted as a positive \nfeedback to climate change, re-enforcing the glacial-intergla-\ncial temperature variations with a very \nhigh correlation.\nThe complexity of the interactions be-\ntween human-induced and natural proc-\nesses producing and absorbing CO2 are \nsummarised in Fig. II.2 in which the \nred arrows show the fluxes due to an-\nthropogenic carbon emissions, and the \nblack arrows quantify the natural carbon \ncycle. The human-induced perturbation \nhas become larger (6.4 Gt\/yr) than the \nnet balance of natural assimilation and \ndissimilation (0.8 Gt\/yr). In addition, \nland use change, which is related to \nthe food consumption of the human \npopulation has caused emissions due \nto land-use change of about 1.6 Gt\/yr, \nwhich is again twice the natural carbon \nbalance, and indirect net carbon sinks \nof about 0.2 Gt\/yr in the ocean due to \nacidification of the marine surface.\nThe future of life on Earth depends on our ability to manage a \nplanet with ever-increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide \nand its consequent dynamic climate. Understanding the natural \nand anthropogenic carbon cycle is a prerequisite to deriving the \nstrategies for mitigation and adaptation. That is why projects, \nsuch as CarboEurope and CarboOcean have been initiated by the \nEuropean Union.\nII Introduction to the Global Carbon Cycle\nso\nur\nce\ns\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\ntime (y)\n1850 1900 1950 2000\nsi\nnk\ns\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nfossil fuel combustion\nland use change\nother emissions\nocean\natmosphere\nland\nCO\n2 \nflu\nx \n(P\ng \nC \ny-\n1 )\nFig. II.1: The development of carbon dioxide emissions, and the uptake by \noceans, land and the atmosphere over time.

Climate models can act as focal points because \nthey must integrate marine and terrestrial effects of fossil fuel \nemissions, biological sources and sinks, and the human use of \nthese environments which range between fisheries and defor-\nestation for food or energy crops. \nWhat happens on land in Europe is not independent of what \nhappens in the North Atlantic, and the future role of the North \nAtlantic in the carbon cycle and as a climate driver depends \nstrongly on the way we manage our land, and on our future \nfossil fuel consumption. If we do not manage our land properly, \nabout 1000 times as much carbon could potentially be released \nfrom soils than is presently emitted from burning fossil fuels. \nThus fossil fuel emissions and land-use are independent sourc-\nes, but their effects are cumulative or compensatory, and both \naffect the processes which operate on the North Atlantic. \u201cIn-\ntegrated\u201d means that we understand these interactions through \nbridging all relevant scientific disciplines and communities, and \nthat we are able to express the policy implications, which then \nmay lead to political decisions in an effective way. With Europe \ntaking the global lead in the climate change mitigation and \nadaptation process, this type of integration is critical, and this \nis why two \u201cIntegrated Projects\u201d, one focusing on oceans, the \nother on the terrestrial surface of Europe were initiated.\nAlthough the major effort in Carbon Cycle research is being car-\nried out by CarboEurope-IP and CarboOcean-IP, their work alone \nis not sufficient and there are additional parallel activities: Ni-\ntroEurope is investigating the interactions between the carbon \ncycle and the nitrogen cycle, and CarboNorth is focusing on \nprocesses in the permafrost region which is important in view \nof permafrost flow and the associated emission of greenhouse \ngases. Also in the marine research CarboOcean is accompanied \nby projects looking into specific aspects of the problem such \nas the impact of rising anthropogenic CO2 on marine biology \nand chemistry (EPOCA). Europe is a complicated continent, with \nclimates ranging from the Mediterranean to the arctic, and from \nmoderate maritime to extreme continental. Although Europe is \ngeographically an extension of the Eurasian continent, it also \nhas links to Africa. Extensions of the research into neighbouring \nregions are therefore important, with research in Siberia (TCOS-\nSiberia) and Africa (CarboAfrica) playing a vital role.\nIn the long term, the challenge is to create the new knowledge \nin an integrated way, and to then understand and predict the \nfuture climate of Europe as it is, embedded in its surrounding \noceans, continental neighbours, and the global context of cli-\nmatic and environmental change.\nThe overarching aim of our Carbon-Cycle research is \u201cto under-\nstand and quantify the carbon balance of Europe and the as-\nsociated uncertainties at local, regional, and continental scale\u201d. \nFor the ocean, special emphasis is placed on the Atlantic and \nSouthern Oceans as critical sink areas for carbon dioxide.\nAlthough the general aim sounds clear and pragmatic, the work \nneeded to achieve this aim is extremely complex. \u201cTo under-\nstand\u201d the carbon balance requires researching the basic bio-\nlogical, chemical, and physical processes which control all the \nfluxes contributing to the carbon balance. \u201cTo understand\u201d also \nrequires the development of computer models which encapsu-\nlate our understanding of the underlying processes in a set of \nequations. \u201cTo quantify\u201d requires capturing the full variation of \nthe carbon balance with climate, ocean conditions, and land-\nhistory and management. This needs the establishment of a \nnetwork of measurement stations, which previously did not ex-\nist. \u201cTo quantify uncertainties\u201d means that all errors, biases and \ndoubts about measurements are evaluated and enumerated. The \naspiration of the \u201cIntegrated Projects\u201d is to reduce the uncer-\ntainty in our estimate compared to the past. \nThe main tool to be used to assess uncertainties in CarboEurope-\nIP was the simple idea that each quantity would be measured \ntwice, by approaching it from larger scales and from smaller \nscales. In many cases larger scales are simpler to assess than \nsmaller scales, thus the resolution of the smaller scales becomes \nimportant. CarboEurope aimed at a resolution of the smallest \nscale to a length of between 10 and 50 km.\nThe main approach of CarboOcean is to combine surface and \ndeep ocean carbon measurements for quantifying the fast and \nslow parts of the uptake and storage mechanisms. Process stud-\nies are carried out to determine quantitatively significant bio-\ngeochemical feedback processes between carbon cycling and \nclimate. Fully fledged global coupled physical-biogeochemical \nmodels are used to project the future marine CO2 uptake for \ngiven greenhouse gas emission scenarios.\nTerrestrial and marine carbon cycle research is at the stage \nwhere progress to a new level of knowledge depends on adopt-\ning an \u201cIntegrated Approach\u201d. In this sense \u201cintegrated\u201d means \nthat the interaction between the atmosphere and the land or \nsea surface must be understood. It is no longer possible to iso-\nlate atmospheric research from the processes at the surface be-\nlow. At the same time, the land and ocean surface processes are \ndriven by atmospheric parameters, which are no longer static. \n\u201cIntegration\u201d also means that the physico-chemical components \nof the carbon cycle can be linked to biological processes. This is \nessential because for the land component the main fluxes of the \ncarbon cycle, the assimilation of CO2 and the decomposition of \norganism-based carbon are under biological control. While the \noceanic CO2 uptake mainly governed by the ocean circulation, \nmixing, and inorganic chemistry, the role of marine biota in \nmodulating the marine carbon fluxes is significant.\nIV The CarboEurope-IP Project\nPart IV:\nAn Assessment of the \nEuropean Terrestrial \nCarbon Balance\nCarboEurope-IP\nedited by\nE.-Detlef Schulze (coordinator),\nJohn Gash, Annette Freibauer, \nand Philippe Ciais\nJena, 2008\nC\nARBO\nE\nU\nROP\nE\nIP\n16\nThe CarboEurope-IP objective of mapping the fluxes of carbon \ninto, and out of, the land surface of Europe created a chal-\nlenge for the designers of the project: how to deal with the \nsmall-scale variability of the European landscape, at the same \ntime as covering the whole geographic extent of the continent. \nThe techniques available to measure or estimate carbon fluxes \ncover a range of time and space scales, but no single technique \ncan produce the required product. The answer was found in an \nintegrated suite of data collection and modelling, designed to \ndeliver the objective based on the philosophy that each number \nmust be checked by two estimates, one coming down from the \nlarge scale, and one up from a smaller scale (Fig. IV.1). \nThis two-pronged approach required measurements at a range \nof scales: \n\u2022 the concentration of CO2 in the free troposphere, using flask-\nsampling from aircraft (vertical profiles through the tropo-\nsphere);\n\u2022 continuous measurements of CO2 concentration in the atmos-\nphere above the surface boundary layer, using tall towers; \nthe exchange of CO2 between component ecosystems and the \natmosphere above the vegetation, using flux towers; and \nintensive gas exchange measurements at the soil surface to \nseparate the responses of soils from the responses of the veg-\netation.\nThus, atmospheric measurements from aircraft and tall towers \nconstrain the quantification of the land-surface flux. Measure-\nments from flux towers and soil gas exchange measurements, \nboth constrain the information about soil fluxes. As Detlef \nSchulze, CarboEurope-IP coordinator, says \u2018The intellectual nov-\nelty in CarboEurope-IP is the dual constraint of each number \nbeing verified by top-down and bottom-up assessments in a hi-\nerarchical approach from the atmosphere to the soil. This gives \nmodellers the confidence they need to calibrate and test their \nmodels. Only by closely integrating observations at various \nscales and modelling we can hope to make realistic predictions \nabout the future.\u2019\nOne core experiment of the programme is a set of high-pre-\ncision observations of the concentration of atmospheric CO2. \nThe background concentration is measured from high-altitude \nor coastal sites where the air is unaffected by the ground level \ninput and output of carbon from human activity, or the fluxes \nfrom the vegetation and soil. Other CO2 samples are collected \non tall towers which are situated where they will collect data \nthat shows just those effects. These samples contain the in-\ntegrated history of the air as it has passed over the continent \nand together give a continental-scale picture of the fluxes over \nthe period of several days that it typically takes the air to move \nacross Europe.\nBuilding up from below, the exchange of CO2 between differ-\nent landscape elements and the atmosphere is measured in a \nnetwork of about 100 sites across Europe. At the centre of each \nsite is a flux tower. Here, micrometeorological techniques are \nused to derive the actual flow of CO2 coming from the \u201cflux \ntower footprint\u201d: an area of several hectares up-wind of the \ntower that is \u201cseen\u201d by the instruments. These measurements \ngive an almost continuous record of the flux from a relatively \nsmall sample of vegetation and soil. A suite of soil and veg-\netation measurements made around the tower provide an addi-\ntional bottom-up estimate of the carbon balance by measuring \nthe slow build up of carbon in the biomass and soil. These \nmeasurements are also used to derive the component fluxes of \ncarbon assimilation by photosynthesis (when plants use sun-\nlight to build up sugars from water and carbon dioxide) and \ncarbon emission by respiration (when soil microbes break down \nplant material and plants burn sugars to provide the energy \nthey need to stay alive). All these data are then used to derive \nthe parameters for the biogeochemical models \u2013 the models \nused to scale-up the fluxes to meet the top-down estimates of \nthe continental carbon balance. \n1. The CarboEurope-IP Approach\nCarboEurope-IP \u201cAssessment of the European Terrestrial \nCarbon Balance\u201d is a European Integrated project of \nFramework Progamme 6 (GOCE-CT-2003-505572) running from \n2003 until 2008. The European Union supports CarboEurope-\nIP with 16 Million \u20ac. The project has 75 contracting partners \nacross 17 European nations, about 470 participants and 60 \nPhD students. \n(http:\/\/www.carboeurope.org)\nFig. IV.1: Atmospheric and ecosystem observations constrain the quantifica-\ntion of the carbon balance.\nProcess Studies\nEcosystem Flux\nMeasurements\nRemote Sensing\nBiomass, \nSoil Carbon\nInventories\nBottom-Up Modelling\nTop-Down Inverse Modelling\nAtmospheric\nObserving System\nAtmospheric\nTransport\nEuropean Flux Estimates\nRegional Experiment:\nMultiple Constraint at\nVery High Resolution\nAtmospheric Concentration Networks\nEcosystem Flux Networks\n17\nAdditionally these techniques were brought together in an \nintensive, regional-scale field experiment. In this experiment \nall the fluxes, at all scales, were simultaneously measured and \nmodelled in a series of campaigns in southwest France. The \nobjective was to provide the data to allow meteorologists to \ndevelop and test the capacity of their short term, \u201cmeso-scale\u201d \nmodels to predict the regional carbon balance; giving a more \nmanageable regional-scale test of the continental-scale model-\nling initiative.\nSatellites can give fine scale data over large areas; and at their \nhighest resolution the scale is comparable with the footprint \nof the flux tower measurements. Satellite data therefore play \na key role in extrapolating the results from the surface-based \nmeasurements to the continental scale. They can provide the \nrelatively small-scale detail needed by biogeochemical models \nand meso-scale models, over the whole continent.\nThis strategy of two-way scaling: up from the flux measure-\nments, and down from the continental network of concentra-\ntion measurements requires integrated science across a range \nof disciplines. At the same time, integrated science requires \nintegrated teams of people \u2013 to be successful there must be \nmovement of information, ideas and people between scientific \ndisciplines and groups of scientists. New thinking is needed \nin linking data, results and understanding across the scientific \ncommunity. CarboEurope-IP has built an integrated team of sci-\nentists: this booklet outlines the progress they have been mak-\ning and highlights some of the results. \n1. The CarboEurope-IP Approach\nThe Integrated Ecosystem Approach\nThe flux of carbon dioxide between the land surface and \nthe atmosphere is the net result of a number of biologi-\ncal, chemical and physical processes which are all occur-\nring simultaneously and varying in response to different \ncontrols. These controls can act at different time scales \nand may be interconnected. Until now the components \nof the carbon balance have usually been measured and \nmodelled separately. Often different groups of special-\nists have worked independently. For example plant \nphysiologists researching the leaf response to sunlight \nhave been working apart from microbiologists research-\ning the population dynamics of soil microbes. Now, in \nCarboEurope-IP a new integrated approach to ecosystem \nresearch has been adopted (Fig. IV.2). This approach is \nbased on treating the ecosystem as a complex web of \ncomponents, any of which may interact with and influ-\nence the others. \nOnce these interactions are recognised, subtle but im-\nportant feedbacks between the vegetation and the at-\nmosphere start to become apparent. For example, it has \nalways been obvious that during drought transpiration \nfrom plants and evaporation from the soil surface is re-\nduced, but only with an integrated approach does it start \nto become clear how drought one year may affect the \ncarbon balance the following year. Lower photosynthesis \nduring drought leads to reduced sugars being stored and \nlower leaf growth; the following year there is then less \nplant material to be broken down by respiration. Captur-\ning these process interactions presents a challenge both \nto the measurement scientists and to the modellers who \nmust represent these processes with equations. \nFig. IV.2: Atmospheric measurements with aeroplanes, tower-based flux measure-\nments and detailed process studies in the ecosystem are needed for quantifying \nand assessing a a complete carbon balance. (Photocollage: Y. Hofmann)\n18\n2. Soils\nSoil has the potential to be a \nmajor longterm sink of atmos-\npheric carbon (Fig. IV.3). CO2 \nis extracted from the air dur-\ning plant photosynthesis and \nlater enters the soil as plants \ndie or shed their old leaves \nand roots (Fig. IV.4). Most of \nthe carbon is held in soil as \norganic matter. The fresh ma-\nterial, the \u201cfast\u201d part of the \ncarbon store, is easily accessi-\nble to the microbes which feed \non it. Micro-organisms use the \nsugars as building material for \ntheir own bodies and as sub-\nstrate for their metabolism. \nThis process, \u201crespiration\u201d, \nreleases carbon back into the \natmosphere, but a part of the \nsoil carbon can remain, bound \ntightly either in the biomass \nof organisms or into the min-\neral component of the soil. \nThis stabilised, or \u201cslow\u201d car-\nbon is less easily accessed by \nsoil microbes and therefore \ncan be regarded as locked into \na carbon sink.\nIt is a major challenge to \nunderstand the processes by \nwhich carbon moves between \nthe slow and fast pools and how this depends on soil type and \nsoil management. Measurements in CarboEurope-IP have shown \nhow respiration depends on the complex interaction of soil tem-\nperature and soil moisture: for example measurements in the \nMediterranean climate zone have revealed that the maximum \nrates of respiration occur in the autumn, when rain falls onto hot \nsoil. This can be simulated by an experiment in which a whole \nplot of Mediterranean scrubland was irrigated (Fig. IV.5). \nRespiration depends mainly on microbial behaviour and popula-\ntion dynamics, rather than on straightforward chemical reac-\ntions and climate. This makes modelling respiration particularly \ndifficult. Current models of respiration are simple empirical \nfunctions of soil temperature and moisture, but these models \nmay not work well outside the conditions for which they were \nderived. Developing more generally applicable, process-based \nmodels of respiration is thus critical if we are to model the \nfuture carbon balance and to estimate how soils will behave \nunder different management or climatic conditions. Eric David-\nson and Ivan Janssens, have pointed out in 2006 that although \nrespiration responds to temperature, this is a bulk response to \nseveral processes which are occurring simultaneously: micro-\nbial and root biomass, enzyme activity, and the diffusion of \ngases and liquids through soil and cell membranes all vary with \ntemperature producing a convoluted response. In addition the \navailability of nutrients is critical and it emerges that respi-\nration depends more on available resources, mainly carbohy-\ndrates, than on climate conditions. The concept of \u201cfast\u201d and \n\u201cslow\u201d pools is also too simplistic. Soil organic carbon can be \neffectively protected against microbial attack when it is locked \naway in soil aggregates, micropores or coated with a hydropho-\nbic layer. Disentangling these processes will require new mod-\nels. The measurements in CarboEurope-IP (see Page 20) are \nstarting to provide the data which will allow more realistic soil \nmodels to be developed.\n2. The Role of Soil\nFig. IV.3: Definitions of the term \u201cproductivity\u201c in the carbon cycle. The initial process is the gross primary produc-\ntion (GPP), which corresponds to photosynthesis. Growth and maintenance requires about 50% of the assimilates \nfor the energy requirement of the plants. Biomass is formed that appears as growth (net primary production, NPP). \nA proportion of this annual increase in biomass is returned to the soil as litter (leaves, roots, flowers) and, of this, \na proportion returns to the atmosphere due to soil respiration. The \u201cnet ecosystem productivity\u201c (NEP) is the bal-\nance between assimilation and total respiration. Independent of soil respiration are processes that remove carbon \nfrom the system without appearing in the respiration term. Examples are harvesting by man, grazing and fire. The \nbalance of all this carbon turnover is called \u201cnet biome productivity\u201c (NBP).

Combining \ntop-down and bottom-up derived quantities is a most power-\nful tool to reduce uncertainties and to derive the most reliable \nestimates of the components of the carbon balance.\nSoil sampling (Fig. IV.6) in CarboEurope-IP has the objective \nof verifying changes in carbon stocks in major land-use types. \nFor this purpose croplands, grasslands, coniferous and decidu-\nous forest were sampled at three sites for each land-use type \n(Fig. IV.7). In order to detect changes over a 5-year period, \nas it is prescribed by the Kyoto commitment period, 100 soil \ncores were taken at each site. Each core is separated into \nsix soil layers. Thus, the sampling scheme yields 7200 soil \nsamples. These samples are further fractionated according to \ntheir chemistry, measured for carbon and nitrogen and stable \nisotopes, and archived in special bottles, so that future gen-\nerations of researchers can come back and check these find-\nings (Fig. IV.8).\nSoil carbon monitoring\nCarboEurope-IP ecosystem observation sites measure the CO2 \nflux continuously as the gas moves through the turbulent at-\nmospheric boundary-layer above the vegetation (see Page \n32). All the major vegetation types are being monitored: pas-\nture, cropland, deciduous and coniferous forest, and wetland. \nHowever, these measurements are subject to error and it is \nimportant to check the long term totals against another, in-\ndependent method. Previously, flux data have been compared \nwith harvest or tree-growth data, but that gives only half the \npicture \u2013 the carbon accumulated (or lost) by the soil must \nalso be monitored. \nCarbon dating (see Page 21) will then be used to show how \nmuch new carbon has become locked into the mineral soil and \nremoved from the carbon cycle. This procedure is consistent \nwith the basic philosophy of combining top-down and bot-\ntom-up predictions at all scales. Flux measurements are a top-\ndown measurement of the response of soils, but this needs to \nFig IV.6: Soil sampling is an exhausting job, especially on heavy and stony soils. It takes a strong person to carry the 30-kg soil sampling equipment over \nlong distances to the study sites, and it takes even more hands to carry back the soil samples. (Photo: M. Schrumpf)\n21\n2.

The Role of Soil\nDuring the time frame of CarboEurope-IP it was possible to as-\nsess the carbon pools on the 12 intensive study sites and to \nmap soil carbon on all flux tower sites. Present and historical \nland-use influence the depth profile of carbon amounts and its \nchemical fractions as well as their turnover times (Fig. IV.9a,b). \nForests have higher carbon concentrations in the upper most \nsoil layers but concentrations decrease with depth. In contrast, \nin croplands carbon concentrations are lower in the top soil, \nbut remain high at soil depth.\nThe age of organic molecules that are bound to mineral surfaces \nis well beyond 1000 years.\nOne fact is now clear: only the carbon which forests and farms \nremove from the carbon cycle by becoming locked into the soil \nis a long term off-set against carbon emitted from burning fos-\nsil fuel. CarboEurope-IP has made studying the build up soil car-\nbon in forest and farms a priority. However, Marion Schrumpf, \nCarboEurope-IP soil scientist, warns, \u2018To prove changes in soil \ncarbon will require more time than provided by CarboEurope-IP. \nThe small-scale heterogeneity of soils leads to very large sam-\npling schemes, and the slow rate of change means that there \nmust be long time steps between observations\u2019.\nFig. IV.9a: Depth distribution of organic carbon (OC) contents of a forest and \na cropland soil. Different kinds of land use result in characteristic depth pro-\nfiles of soil carbon. In undisturbed forest soils, carbon contents decrease with \nsoil depth. Ploughing leads to a homogenisation of carbon contents within \nthe plough layer (0-30 cm soil depth) of croplands. Harvest reduces carbon \ninputs to cropland soils and ploughing increases mineralisation so that car-\nbon contents in the topsoil of croplands are lower than in forest or grassland \nsoils. Since croplands are often found on deep, fertile soils, carbon contents \nin the subsoil can be higher than in shallower forest soils. Density fractiona-\ntion can be used to separate total organic carbon (OC) contents of the soil in \nthree functional pools: the free light fraction (fLF), which consists of largely \nundecomposed plant fragments, the occluded light fraction (oLF), which is \nformed by more degraded plant fragments temporarily protected against fur-\nther decomposition within soil aggregates, and organic molecules bound to \nmineral surfaces (HF). The latter forms the most stable fraction of the three \nOC pools with turnover times of more than 100 years. Figure 8a shows that \nreduced carbon input and increased mineralisation in croplands lead to a \nreduction of the contribution of fLF and oLF in the total carbon content.\nCropland \nC [g] in density fractions of 1 kg soil \n0 2  0 4  0 6  0 8  0 \nForest \nC [g] in density fractions of 1 kg soil \n0 2  0 4  0 6  0 8  0 \nSo\nil \nde\npt\nh \n[c\nm\n ] \n0-5 \n5-10 \n10-20 \n20-30 \n30-40 \n40-50 \n50-60 \nOC molec\nPartly de\nFree ligh\nOC molecules bound to mineral surfaces (HF)\nPartly decomposed light OC in aggregates (oLF)\nFree light OC, mainly plant fragments (fLF)\n23\n2. The Role of Soil\nRobust findings:\nOnly carbon that is locked into mineral particles or wet peat is \nremoved from the active carbon cycle. But a lot of this carbon \ncan be activated again by land use and land-use change, such \nas ploughing up of grasslands.\nTo prove soil carbon stock changes over a 5-year commitment \nperiod requires a major effort of soil sampling. CarboEurope-\nIP has established a sampling design across various land use \ntypes that is robust enough to prove such changes.\nKey questions:\nWhat are the chemical and biological processes which move \ncarbon into long term storage and can these be managed?\nHow should we model these soil-carbon stabilisation pro-\ncesses?\nCan the slow accumulation of carbon in soil be detected within \nperiods of less than a decade?\nFig. IV.9b: The radioactive 14C isotope can be used to determine the mean age \nof organic carbon (OC) in the fractions since the ratio between 12C and 14C in \nthe atmosphere is fixed in the plants and then changes with time following \nthe decay rate of 14C. The plant signal of wheat harvested in the year 1955 \nwas used as standard material. By definition all 14C concentrations smaller \nthan this reference value are said to be old carbon, while higher concentra-\ntions are \u201cmodern\u201d and originate after 1955. The reason for the increase \nin atmospheric 14C concentration after 1955 are the nuclear bomb tests in \nthe 1950s and 1960s which almost doubled the original 14C concentration. \nThe Figure shows the 14C content of different density fractions expressed as \npercent modern carbon. Values above 100% indicate a contribution of bomb \ncarbon to OC contents and thus an average origin after 1955. The Figures \nshow that in both, forests and croplands, carbon age increases with soil \ndepths and for each soil layer, youngest carbon is found in the fLF and oldest \nin the HF fraction. The mean carbon age of the forest was younger than that \nof the cropland indicating more additions of new carbon to the forest soil. \nOldest carbon with a mean age of 2080 \u00b1 100 years was found in the HF of \nthe cropland site.

Schulze)\n3.1 Forests\nAre forests better than farms at removing carbon from the at-\nmosphere? The public certainly think so: the many tree-planting \nschemes reflect a belief that CO2 emissions can be off-set by \nnew forest growth. But is there hard scientific evidence to back \nup this perception? Planting new forests, where none existed \nbefore, will extract CO2 from the atmosphere and convert it to \nstanding timber. However, tree plantations decompose existing \nsoil carbon and extract nutrients for growth. It takes 60 years \nbefore plantations on grassland are carbon neutral (Thuille and \nSchulze, 2006). Mixed-age forests will always contain standing \ntimber and therefore a store of carbon, but how does the carbon \nuptake change with time, and when forests age, do they con-\ntinue to be a net sink for carbon? Similarly, is agricultural land \n(cropland and pasture) a source or a sink of carbon? Above-\nground there may be no visible increase in carbon, but what \nis happening below the surface, is carbon building up in the \nsoil? Key questions such as these are being addressed by the \nCarboEurope-IP plant and soil scientists.\nEurope\u2019s forests are almost entirely managed (Fig. IV.10a,b,c). \nTrees are felled when they approach commercial value and most \nof the above-ground biomass, i.e. the wood, is removed and \nsold. It is then used for a variety of purposes such as paper, \nfuel, or in the construction industry. Over time, most of this \nwood will either be burned or allowed to decompose: the carbon \nwill then be returned to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide gas. \nOn the other hand, forests produce large quantities of leaf and \nwoody litter, which as it decomposes can enrich the soil with \norganic matter. Agricultural land is of course even more highly \nmanaged than forests and the carbon in the food produced will \nbecome carbon dioxide almost immediately. CarboEurope-IP has \nthe task of evaluating the carbon fluxes from forest and farms \nand assessing how these very different ecosystems contribute \nto the carbon cycle.\nAnnual carbon balance data are now available from more than \n500 forest sites over the world. The variation between indi-\nvidual sites, and from year-to-year, is large but taking the data \ntogether a coherent picture is emerging. Carbon absorbed by \nthe actual vegetation increases with higher rainfall and tem-\nperature, until an annual total of about 1500 mm rainfall and \nan average annual temperature of 10\u02daC are reached. Beyond \nthese values, photosynthesis saturates and there is no further \nincrease in the amount of carbon absorbed. Ideal conditions for \nhigher carbon absorption are also favourable for the breakdown \nof dead organic material by microbes, thus leading to faster \nreturn of the absorbed carbon to the atmosphere. As a result, \nLuyssaert et al. (2008) showed that the net carbon balance of \nforests is rather similar over the whole world. Variations be-\ntween forest sites are not the result of climatic differences, but \nmore likely to be due to factors such as forest age, management \nand history of disturbance. \n25\n3. Forests and Farms\nFig. IV.12: 120-year old managed beech forest at Leinefelde in Germany with \na 40 m high measuring tower. The straight timber and the tall trees are the re-\nsult of 120 years of good management by foresters. (Photo: E.-D. Schulze)\nPhilippe Ciais headed a CarboEurope-IP analysis of Eu-\nropean forest inventory and harvest data over the past \n50 years. He found that for all countries in Europe the \nenvironmental conditions, in combination with current \nforest management, have resulted in forests efficiently \nsequestering carbon, while at the same time meeting \nthe demand for wood (Fig. IV.11). However, the study \nwarned that shorter rotation times and a return to using \nforest for biofuel could cancel the benefits that have ac-\ncumulated over the past five decades. Thus, old forests \nmay not be seen in the future (Fig. IV.12).\nFig. IV.11: During the last 50 years, Europe has, on average, multiplied the bi-\nomass carbon stocks per hectare by 1.75 and the net primary productivity by \n1.67. The forest shows that forest biomass increased with the rate of growth \n(total NPP). Wood harvest was only a small fraction of total NPP. Therefore \nwood biomass increased despite the harvest. A model simulation shows that \nthe increase in biomass and productivity is caused not by changing climate, \nbut due to management decisions by foresters.

(2008) conclude that the forest sink is 195 Tg C y-1 \nwhich is smaller than the estimate made by Janssens et al. in \n2003. About 50% of this forest sink is located in the forests of \nEuropean Russia.\n26\n3. Forests and Farms\nThe Hainich Forest\nIn unmanaged forest no timber is extracted and when trees die \nthe wood is left to decompose and the nutrients recycled. Are \nthese forests carbon-neutral or do they continue to act as car-\nbon sinks? Measurements in the pristine forests of Amazonia \nshow that such forests can continue to act as carbon sinks. \nNitrogen fertilization (see Page 40) and possibly the effects \nof increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and higher tem-\nperatures resulting from climate change all suggest we should \nexpect unmanaged forests to continue absorbing carbon (see \nPage 29); but at what rate and for how long? These questions \nare being addressed at a CarboEurope-IP measurement site in \nthe Hainich Forest in Germany.\nHainich Forest (Fig. IV.13), which has not been managed com-\nmercially for over 60 years, is being used to study the carbon \ndynamics of natural woodland. All the stores of carbon and the \ncomponents of the carbon balance are being monitored in one \nof the most intensive forest experiments ever mounted.\nContrary to earlier predictions and despite the fact that many \nof the living trees are 200 to 300 years old, and root stocks are \nup to 600 years old, Hainich unmanaged forest is acting as a \nsink of carbon. Martina Mund, of the Max-Planck-Institute for \nBiogeochemistry, is leading the research team at Hainich, she \nsaid \u2018It was a surprise to find that an old, unmanaged forest \nFig. IV.13: The Hainich National Park (Germany) from above (Photo: T.

The inventories were made in year \n2000 and 2007. \nlike Hainich was a sink for carbon. The question now is why? Is \nthis forest moving to a new equilibrium driven by outside in-\nfluences? If so what are those influences and for how long will \nthey continue to cause this forest to be a net sink of carbon?\u2019 \nThe CarboEurope-IP whole-ecosystem, top-down\/bottom-up \napproach to measurement is starting to produce the answers \nto these questions. Eddy covariance measurements (see Page \n32) are telling us that the Hainich forest is a sink of carbon. \nThe inventories and surveys are revealing that most of the \ncarbon is going into the trees, the soil being only a small sink \nfor carbon. Long term monitoring is in progress to establish \nthe trends in carbon absorption.\nSt\nem\n v\nol\num\ne \n[m\n3  \nha\n-1\n]\nNational Park Hainich, 2000-2007\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\nBasal area in year 2000 [m2 ha-1]\nBasal area in year 2000 [m2 ha-1]\nb\na\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\nYe\nar\nly\n c\nha\nng\ne \nin\n s\nte\nm\n v\nol\num\ne\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nI\nII\n III\nVI\nvolume growth \naccording to yield tables\nx 2000\n 2007 with loss of trees\n 2007 without loss of trees\n[m\n3  \nha\n-1\n y\nr-1\n]\nFig. IV.14b: Annual change in stem volume between the \nyears 2000 and 2007 as related to basal area in year \n2000.

The yearly \nstem increment was even larger in Hainich than recorded by \nthe highest yield class of yield tables (Fig. IV.14b).\n28\n3. Forests and Farms\nEuropean forests as a carbon sink and as wood \nresource\nThe forest inventory is a robust method of measur-\ning the build up of carbon by forests. At the heart \nof the technique is the mensuration survey of con-\nventional forest resources or timber. Foresters have \ncarried out these surveys in many European coun-\ntries and in some countries national data go back as \nfar as the 19th century. All the individual trees in a \nsample plot are counted and a sub-sample of trees \nare measured for their dimensions (Fig. IV.15). Al-\nlometric relationships are then used to convert these \ndata to the total weight of carbon stored by the trees \nabove and below ground. There are some 400 000 \nplots in western Europe monitored at intervals of 5 \nor 10 years. Data are reported as part of the national \ncarbon statistics required under the Climate Conven-\ntion and the Kyoto Protocol.\nEuropean forests are intensively exploited for wood \nproducts, yet they also form a potential sink for car-\nbon. European forest inventories can be combined \nwith timber harvest statistics to assess changes in \nthis carbon sink. Analysis of these data sets between \n1950 and 2000 from EU-15 countries, excluding Lux-\nembourg, but adding Norway and Switzerland, reveals \nthat there is a tight relationship between increases \nin forest biomass and forest ecosystem productivity, \nbut timber harvest grew more slowly. The type of sil-\nviculture that has been deployed over the past 50 \nyears can efficiently sequester carbon on timescales \nof decades (Fig. IV.11).\nFig. IV.15: Survey work in a forest in Germany.

The green dots \nshow observations of temperate forests and orange dots of boreal forests. The thick black line shows the median within a moving window of 15 observa-\ntions. The grey area around this line shows the 95% confidence interval of the median. The data show an increase of biomass with age. At the same time \nthe ratio of heterotrophic respiration and net primary productivity (Rh\/NPP) remains an average below unity. (Luyssaert et al., 2008)\nOld growth forests\nIt is generally thought that with ageing, old-growth forests as \nshown in Figure IV.16 cease to accumulate carbon and are there-\nfore carbon-neutral. For that reason they are not yet included in \ninternational treaties. But evidence examined by CarboEurope-IP \nsuggests that these forests continue to remove carbon dioxide \nfrom the atmosphere at rates that vary with climate and nitro-\ngen deposition (see Page 38). The sequestered carbon dioxide \nis stored in live woody tissues and slowly decomposing organic \nmatter in litter and soil. Old-growth forests therefore serve as a \nglobal carbon dioxide sink. Searching the literature and data-\nbases for forest carbon-flux estimates, revealed that in forests \nbetween 15 and 800 years of age, biomass continues to increase \nwith age and the ratio of respiration over growth does not ap-\nproach an equilibrium with age. Luyssaert et al. (2008) demon-\nstrate that \u201cthe long standing view of forest growth seems to be \ndeficient and even old growth forest continue to take up carbon. \nThis means that for the next decades they will be sinks\u201d. The ratio \nof respiration and growth remains below 1 up to very old stand \nages.\nOver 30% of the global forest area is unmanaged primary forest, \nand this area contains the remaining old-growth forests. Half \nof the primary forests are located in the boreal and temperate \nregions of the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. IV.17). On the basis of \nthe CarboEurope-IP analysis, these forests alone sequester about \n1.3 \u00b1 0.5 gigatonnes of carbon per year. This suggests that 15% \nof the global forest area, that is currently not considered when \noffsetting increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, \nprovides at least 10 per cent of the global net ecosystem produc-\ntivity. Old-growth forests accumulate carbon for centuries and \ncontain large quantities of it. However, much of this carbon, even \nsoil carbon, may move back to the atmosphere if these forests are \ndisturbed or converted into agricultural land.\nFig. IV.16: Pristine old growth forest in the National Park of Uholskyje \nof the Kapartian Mountains, Ukraine.

On the other hand, European \nfarms are highly managed and the regulatory \nframework and market in which they operate \nhas made them very flexible and efficient (Fig. \nIV.18). Farmers have already shown how they \ncan successfully manage their land to meet \npolicy objectives, such as conserving biodi-\nversity, and this flexibility offers the real pos-\nsibility of managing farmland to mitigate the \ngreenhouse gas emitted by burning fossil fuel \n(Smith et al., 2008). \nBecause many of the changes in carbon oc-\ncur in the soil, we know less about the carbon \nbalance of agricultural land than we do about \nforests. Also, with crop rotation the carbon en-\ntering the soil changes every year (Fig. IV.19). \nBut this lack in knowledge is disappearing: \nCarboEurope-IP is collecting and analysing new \ndata from cropland at 9 sites in 6 nations.\nBefore CarboEurope-IP, the best estimates of \nthe cropland carbon balance were obtained \nfrom simple budgets of carbon loss and land \nuse change. Now, results from the first years of \nobservations in CarboEurope-IP are giving the \nfirst measurement-based insight into the crop-\nland greenhouse gas balance for Europe. Pete \nSmith of the University of Aberdeen explains, \n\u2018Before CarboEurope-IP began, croplands were \nthought to be a large source of carbon, but \nnew measurements and modelling results from \nCarboEurope-IP now make us believe that dur-\ning the 1990s, croplands were either a very \nsmall source of carbon or may even have \nbeen a small carbon sink. CarboEurope-IP has \nshown that croplands have significant poten-\ntial to store additional carbon, with a number \nof practices, such as reduced tillage, improved \nrotations, and increased crop productivity, \nable to lock up additional soil carbon\u2018. Field \nobservations still classify croplands as a minor \nsource but all models predict that cropland are \ncarbon neutral or a small sink. This uncertainty \nwill remain until the re-inventory of soils has \nbeen accomplished.\n3. Forests and Farms\nFig. IV.18: Agricultural landscape near Gebesee in Thuringia, Germany (Photo: E.-D.

In early spring agricultural fields with summer crops \nmay be sources for CO2 before the crop covers the soil. Then carbon dioxide is removed from the \natmosphere (decreasing value) and the vegetation is a sink. There is a step change after harvest \ndue to carbon removal in harvested products, and depending on management and crop type the \nfield will be a source when balanced over the year. (Kutsch, unpublished)\n31\n3.3 Grasslands\nPastures are managed differently to croplands \u2013 there is no reg-\nular ploughing, which in cropland aerates the soil and increases \nthe microbial populations which break down stored-carbon and \nemit CO2. The grassland carbon balance must therefore be as-\nsessed separately. In contrast to previous thinking, new meas-\nurements and modelling in CarboEurope-IP are now revealing \nthat grasslands are locking up carbon. Also in grasslands year-\nto-year variability is high. A simple data-based approach has \nled to an improved estimate of the size of this European net \ngrassland carbon sink. Importantly, it shows that this sink can \nbe readily managed and that a less intensive use of grasslands \nis likely to increase carbon sequestration, provided that nutri-\nents do not become limiting. Grassland management, such as \ncutting, grazing and manuring, has a large impact on whether \nor not grasslands lock up carbon. On the other hand, emissions \nof the other main greenhouse gases, methane and nitrous ox-\nide, have been shown to partly offset some of the benefits from \nincreased soil carbon storage in grasslands (Fig. IV.20,21). \nIn Europe, a major part of the emissions are produced when \nanimals are housed inside, making it important that the green-\nhouse gas balance of animal\/pasture systems are established \nat the whole farm level. Such a \u201cwhole-economic system\u201d ap-\nproach will be needed in future also for agriculture and forestry, \nserving as the basis for a \u201cfull-carbon-accounting\u201d system. \nAlthough greenhouse gas emissions from cattle have received \nmajor public attention recently, the emissions and grassland are \nsmall compared to emissions from traffic (Fig. IV.22). \nThe new estimates of CarboEurope-IP suggest that grasslands \nare a stronger sink than estimated in 2003. The total sink ap-\nproaches that of forests with uncertainty because we do not \nknow the effects of periodic ploughing. \nFig. IV.21: Map showing model results of difference in mean soil organic car-\nbon (SOC) stocks in grasslands between 1990 and 2080 for a climate change \nscenario (A2), including changes in NPP (net primary productivity), advances \nin technology and regional differences in SOC stocks.

Forests and Farms\nCO2 flux measurements by \u201ceddy covariance\u201d\nCO2 is transported between the atmosphere and the surface \nby diffusing through the turbulent atmospheric boundary \nlayer just above the vegetation. By measuring the vertical \nwind velocity and the concentration of the gas many times \nper second it is possible to calculate the net flux of CO2 \nbetween the atmosphere and a patch of land upwind of \nthe instruments (the footprint), typically of several hec-\ntares. This technique, called \u201ceddy covariance\u201d, measures \nthe CO2 flux over minutes and hours, and can be aggre-\ngated, often with the use of correction and gapfilling al-\ngorithms, to daily and yearly fluxes (Fig. IV.23). The short \ntime resolution makes the data ideal for understanding the \nbiological processes controlling the CO2 flux and to link \nthese findings to new model development and improve-\nment of existing models. Daily and weekly timescales are \noften used for parameterisation and validation of mod-\nels that describe ecosystem and atmospheric fluxes. The \nlonger time scale is used to derive long term estimates of \nthe carbon budget at individual sites.\nSince eddy-covariance data require careful evaluation and \nuncertainty estimation, CarboEurope-IP has put a lot of ef-\nfort into quality control and error analysis. The data quali-\nty was characterized by footprint analysis (a description of \nthe homogeneity of the area where the signal comes from \nassuming a horizontal terrain), by comparison of the soft-\nware used to calculate the fluxes, spike detection, filtering \nand a number of additional tools. The central database \nof CarboEurope-IP developed standard methods for data \nfiltering and gap-filling, including uncertainty evaluation, \n(Fig. IV.24) resulting in a combined and harmonized Car-\nboEurope-IP dataset that is now starting to reveal a con-\nsistent picture of how carbon fluxes vary over Europe at \ndifferent timescales. Additional experiments were run in \nthe ADVEX-subproject to understand problems that arise in \ncomplex terrain. Under these conditions lateral transport \nof air, or \u201cadvection\u201d, may prevent the eddy covariance \ntechnology giving a true picture of the fluxes. Advection \nmay occur under turbulent and non-turbulent conditions, \nand it remains difficult to detect in many situations. This \nwork has highlighted the need for critical investigation of \nall long-term sites to certify the balance. \nReduction of uncertainty and bias detection in the car-\nbon fluxes estimates at ecosystem level is particularly \nimportant and a recent study concluded that additional \nindependent measurements are needed, such as biometric \nmeasurements of productivity and measurements of respi-\nration in order to check the consistency of the flux bal-\nance.\nEddy covariance has been widely adopted as a method of \nmeas\u00acuring CO2 fluxes and there is a network of more than 400 \nsites around the world, with over 100 operating in CarboEurope-IP \n(Fig. IV.25). This global network, \u201cFluxnet\u201d, which started from \nan EC-funded project of FP4, is probably the largest scien\u00actific \ncollaboration in terrestrial ecology there has ever been. Currently, \nglobal scale synthesis activities are ongoing using data from the \nworldwide network of sites, processed and standardised using the \nCarboEurope-IP methodology. Ricardo Valentini of the University \nof Tuscia and co-initiator of \u201cFluxnet\u201d says \u2018Each Fluxnet field site \nis producing information on the carbon balance of a particular \necosystem and how it responds to different weather and plant \nconditions; put together the whole network of sites is now giving \nus a measurement-based picture of how the Earth\u2019s land surface \nbreathes and how it responds to climate.\u2019\nFig. IV.23: Maintaining eddy flux instruments over a crop field. \n(Photo: W.

Forests and Farms\nEffects of Changing seasons\nA study led by Shilong Piao found that the carbon \nbalance of terrestrial ecosystems is particularly sensi-\ntive to climatic changes in autumn and spring. This \nis important because over the past two decades over \nnorthern latitudes spring temperatures have risen by \nabout 1.1\u00b0C  and autumn temperatures by about 0.8\u00b0C. \nAt the same time satellite observations of the Earth\u2019s \nsurface have revealed a greening trend, characterised \nby a longer growing season and more photosynthesis. \nOne would expect that in the future, this spring and \nautumn warming might enhance annual carbon seques-\ntration by extending the summer period of net carbon \nuptake. \nPiao and his co-workers analysed interannual varia-\ntions in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration data \nand ecosystem carbon dioxide fluxes. Surprisingly, they \nfound that atmospheric records from the past 20 years \nshowed a trend towards an earlier autumn-to-winter \ncarbon dioxide build-up (Fig. IV.26), suggesting a \nshorter net carbon uptake period. We are not only ob-\nserving an early greening in spring but also an earlier \nbrowning in autumn (Fig. IV.27) in many but not all \necosystems. This unexpected trend is supported by the \necosystem flux data, which suggests increasing carbon \nlosses in autumn. Both photosynthesis and respiration \nwere found to increase during autumn warming, but \na greater increase in respiration out-weighed the in-\ncrease in photosynthesis resulting in an increased net \nloss. The opposite occurs in springtime when warming \nincreases photosynthesis more than respiration. In fact, \nwinter cereals show carbon uptake in the warm winters \n(Fig. IV.28). Surprisingly, the effects on the rate of \ntranspiration are very small. The research concluded \nthat northern terrestrial ecosystems may currently lose \ncarbon dioxide in response to autumn warming, with a \nsensitivity of about 0.2 Pg C per \u00b0C, offsetting 90% of \nthe increased carbon dioxide uptake during spring.\nThere is a surprising year-to-year variation in the net \ncarbon balance of farmland sites, with a complex in-\nteraction between temperature, water availability and \nmanagement being the most important factor. In con-\ntrast the pattern is more stable in forest sites, because \nthere is no change in the vegetation. Also, tree diver-\nsity helps to maintain ecosystem functions even in ex-\ntreme years, such as the dry year of 2003. Despite the \nvariations, we can reach the general conclusion that \nforests and grasslands are absorbing carbon, while ag-\nricultural sites are likely to be a source of carbon. \nFig. IV.27: The browning of Europe is closely related to increasing temperatures in \nthe northern hemisphere.

Uptake of CO2 by \nphotosynthesis is characterised by negative numbers (yellow, green and blue colours) and CO2 emissions due to respiration in winter and during night by \npositive numbers (red colours).In eight subsequent years measured in Hainich Forest the seasonal pattern of CO2 fluxes is relatively constant. Only small \nsummer depressions can be detected during dry periods in 2003 and 2006. In five subsequent years measured in Gebesee, CO2 assimilation is characterised \nby the crop type with highest uptake rates in spring and early summer and CO2 emissions during the fallow periods. Small uptake rates during winter can \nbe detected in 2004, 2005 and 2007 when winter crops were grown. H2O fluxes (evapotranspiration) are mainly driven by climatic conditions in the two \necosytems.

Forests and Farms\n3.4 Land-use Change\nCarboEurope-IP has not focused its work on changes in the \ncarbon stocks of existing land use (land use without land-use \nchange) or those resulting from land-use change (the change \nfrom one category of land-use to another), but these can signifi-\ncantly affect the European carbon balance. We therefore include \nan analysis here. Certain aspects have been covered by CarboEu-\nrope, such as the investigation of the effectof  afforestation \nof grasslands on organic soils (Thuille and Schulze, 2006), the \nstudies of changes from arable agriculture into grasslands, and \ncrop abandonment (Steinbeiss et al., 2008; Don et al., 2008). \nA few studies looked into the future considering different eco-\nnomic scenarios (Schulp et al., 2008). However, at the same \ntime various reviews on the effects of land-use change have \nbecome available (Guo and Gifford, 2002; Paul et al., 2002). \nGeneralisations at the European scale are difficult, but the Cli-\nmate Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change (UNFCCC) summarises the national reports, \nwhich give detailed information about the areas of changed \nland-use and estimates of the changes in the associated carbon \npools of the EU-25.\nTable 1 summarises the information of the national reports of \nthe UNFCCC (http:\/\/unfccc.int\/national_reports\/items\/1408.\nphp). In the EU-25 a total about 24 million ha were changed \ninto other land-uses. The main winners were croplands (8.4 mil-\nlion ha) followed by forests (6.5 million ha) and grasslands (6.1 \nmillion ha). The main losers were grasslands (12 million ha) and \ncrop abandonment (6.9 million ha).\nThe resultant changes in carbon stocks and greenhouse gas \nemissions suggest that these land-use changes resulted in a \ntotal GHG-sink of 10 Tg C yr-1 in 2005. Including the changes in \ncarbon stocks of existing land-use (land use without land-use \nchange) results in an additional sink of 100 Tg C yr-1 in 2005, \nbut these stocks may in future be harvested. \nAlthough some of the numbers are highly uncertain, such as the \nnumbers indicating the change from grassland to forest, which \nshould be a source, we must acknowledge, that this is the most \ncomplete summary available. The numbers indicating changes \nin stocks of existing land cover are included in the CarboEurope-\nIP Assessment. Thus, only the Land-use Change in soils has not \nbeen included, yielding a removal from the atmosphere of about \n10 Tg C yr-1 in 2005.\nModelling land-use change using the LPJ and ORCHIDEE model \nYields 36 to 41 Tg C yr-1 as sink activity in year 2000. This is in \nthe range of reported land-use and land-use change.\nUNFCCC 2005 Change to\nChange in land area Change from Forest Grass Crop Wetland Settlement Other total loss\nOriginal land-use Forest 0.00 0.60 0.29 0.07 0.58 0.20 1.74 Mill ha\nGrass 3.56 0.00 7.96 0.02 1.02 0.06 12.62 Mill ha\nCrop 1.07 5.19 0.00 0.02 0.56 0.07 6.91 Mill ha\nWetland 0.32 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.02 0.11 0.46 Mill ha\nSettlement 0.31 0.24 0.16 0.03 0.00 0.02 0.76 Mill ha\nOther 1.30 0.07 0.01 0.09 0.08 0.00 1.55 Mill ha\nTotal gain 6.56 6.11 8.42 0.23 2.26 0.46 24.04 Mill ha\nChange in carbon stocks Forest 0.00 -0.02 -0.43 -0.03 -0.41 -0.20 -1.09 Tg C yr-1\nSoils only Grass 5.72 0.00 -7.98 -0.05 -1.53 -0.11 -3.95 Tg C yr-1\nCrop 1.25 6.25 0.00 -0.01 -0.59 -0.05 6.85 Tg C yr-1\nWetland 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 -0.01 0.00 Tg C yr-1\nSettlement 0.20 0.29 0.06 0.00 0.00 -0.03 0.52 Tg C yr-1\nother 0.78 0.13 0.00 -0.21 -0.01 0.00 0.69 Tg C yr-1\nTotal gain 7.96 6.65 -8.35 -0.30 -2.54 -0.40 3.02 Tg C yr-1\nLand-use change 2005 Total + GHG -17.43 -5.34 8.75 0.69 3.60 0.78 -8.96 Tg C\nLand-use 2005 -118.91 7.55 1.79 1.04 0.14 0.00 -108.39 Tg C\nTable 1: Summary of the national reports on land-use change and changes in carbon stocks by land use.

Forests and Farms\nKey questions:\nHow do we manage European forest and farmland to increase \nthe soil-carbon store?\nWhat happens with all the carbon following stand replace-\nment?\nHow do we devise a full greenhouse-gas accounting system \nincluding the use of products?\nHow to verify the areas and effects of land-use change as \nreported by UNFCCC?\nRobust findings:\nThere is a large year-to-year variation in the net carbon bal-\nance mainly of farmland sites which is driven by climate vari-\nation and land management.\nForest are the main carbon sink of continental Europe despite \ntimber extraction and management (195 Tg C yr-1) with 50% of \nthis sink being located in European Russia.\nGrasslands sequester about half of the amount as forests (90 \nTg C yr-1). In fact, the rate of sequestration of carbon into soil \nper unit land area is larger in grasslands than in forests (60 vs \n20 g C km-2 yr-1).\nCroplands are carbon sources (-10 Tg C yr-1) but croplands have \nthe potential to be managed as a carbon sinks. Increased car-\nbon uptake of crops in spring are balanced by greater emis-\nsions in autumn.\n38\n4. Peatlands\nNatural peatlands are a typical boreal and arctic landscape (Fig. \nIV.29). They are a net sink for carbon dioxide but emit meth-\nane, CH4, when the peat is water-saturated. Peatlands can give \noff carbon dioxide, CO2, if the surface dries out, allowing oxygen \nto reach the peat, and aerobic respiration to take place. Typi-\ncally, the surface of a peat bog will switch to aerobic respiration \nin early summer. Unmanaged peatlands are generally close to \nbeing carbon-neutral with the CO2 and CH4 emitted being bal-\nanced by the CO2 accumulated in new peat. In the far north, \nthe length of the snow-free period is also an important factor, \nas although respiration may continue under the snow cover, \nphotosynthesis is only possible when the surface is exposed to \nsunlight. \nTraditionally, peatlands have been used as a source of ener-\ngy  (Fig. IV.30). In the maritime, temperate European zone, \nbroadly stretching from Ireland through to Germany, relatively \nlarge areas of peat have been drained for agriculture. When this \noccurs the peat decomposes, emitting CO2. Although peatlands \ncover only 3% of the land surface in this zone, CarboEurope-IP \nscientists estimate that the CO2 source from converted peat-\nland roughly equals a quarter of the carbon sink from European \nforests. In addition, peatlands used for agriculture are often \nhotspots for N2O emissions as a consequence of fertilizer ap-\nplication.\nRestoration of some peatlands by flooding is taking place in re-\nsponse to the need to maintain biodiversity and manage floods \n(Fig. IV.31), but this increases the methane (CH4) emission. \nBecause CH4 is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, estimat-\ning the net impact of peatland restoration on global warming \nis not straightforward. In nutrient-poor peat bogs restoration \nhas led to net savings of greenhouse gases in all studies; but \nrestoration of nutrient-rich fen peatlands, bears some risk of \nincreasing net greenhouse gas emissions, in particular when \nthey remain flooded over summer. However, for CO2 and other \ntrace gases, so far there are hardly any annual or longer meas-\nurements available. \nCarboEurope-IP is making new measurements of CO2 and CH4 \nfluxes over various fen peatlands to produce the first multi-year \nbalances of greenhouse gases and carbon at fens. Results from \na fen nature reserve restored ten years ago show that restora-\ntion can bring benefits for the climate: although CH4 emissions \nfrom the saturated land and water surfaces were high compared \nto the relatively dry land on the ridges, overall, the area has \nbecome a net sink of carbon and greenhouse gases. Small land-\nscape elements, such as peatlands, can have a large impact on \nthe overall carbon and greenhouse gas balance, but are easily \noverlooked and are not yet captured by models. The importance \nof peatlands in the regional hydrological balance goes far be-\nyond the greenhouse effect.\n4.

Schulze)\n39\nEuropean peatlands\nCarboEurope-IP scientists are using \u201ceddy \ncovariance\u201d to measure CO2 and CH4 (see \nPage 32) to capture the \u201cbreathing\u201d of \nfens. \nFor the first time measurements will al-\nlow emissions to be linked directly to the \nphysiological response of the vegetation \nas it responds to the environment.\nCarboEurope-IP initiated a European syn-\nthesis of all available measurement data \nfrom peatlands in Europe. European peat-\nlands hold 42 Pg of carbon in the form \nof peat and are therefore a considerable \ncomponent in the European carbon re-\nserve. European peatlands annually emit \n20 to 30 Tg carbon (Fig. IV.32a,b). If CH4 \nand N2O emissions are included, the net \ngreenhouse gas source increases to 50 Tg \ncarbon equivalents. \nThe depth to the water table is the most \ncritical environmental parameter for the \ngreenhouse gas balance of peatlands, \nfollowed by temperature and vegetation \ntype. Deeply drained peatlands under ag-\nricultural use are strong sources of CO2 \nwhile shallow drainage for forestry can \nmaintain a neutral greenhouse gas bal-\nance. The CO2 sink increases linearly with \nrising mean annual water table. Signifi-\ncant CH4 emission only occurs when the \nmean annual water table is within 10 cm \nof the surface.\nRobust findings:\nThe relatively small area of peatlands has a relativly large im-\npact on the overall carbon and greenhouse gas balance of \nEurope.\nThe emissions from managed peatlands take about 1\/3 of the \ncarbon sink of european forests. \nPeatland restoration reduces CO2 emissions but can increase \nCH4 emissions; the overall impact of restoration is usually a \nnet saving of greenhouse gases but depends on the nutrient \nlevels of the peat.\nFig. IV.32b: Conservative estimate for the peatlands greenhouse gas budget of the top ten peat \ncountries by area in Europe.

This is to be expected \nbecause the measurements are taken in \ndifferently managed forests, of different \nages and with different soil and climat-\nic conditions. Tree growth merges into \na constant growth rate with age. How-\never, at any moment the rate of carbon \nuptake at a particular site will depend \non the age composition and density of \nthe stand. Forest management also influ-\nences growth rates by controlling stand \ndensity, and management practices have \nbeen changing over recent decades. Ad-\nditional factors that might be influencing \nforest growth rate are increased tempera-\nture and carbon dioxide concentration, \nor nitrogen deposition from the atmos-\nphere. \nThe apparent variability in the observations has been unrav-\nelled by a CarboEurope-IP study which removed the effects of \nstand age by considering the whole forest management cycle. \nThe results showed that nitrogen deposition was the major \nfactor controlling the size of the carbon sink. Atmospheric ni-\ntrogen pollution occurs when gases such as NOx and NH3 are \ncreated during combustion of fossil fuel and the spreading of \nfertilizer and liquid manure from animal farming. Nitrogen ox-\nides and aerosols return to earth largely as \u201cwet deposition\u201d in \nrain drops. Gases and small particules can also be taken up by \nplants as \u201cdry deposition\u201d (Fig. IV.33). Most forests are grow-\ning on nitrogen deficient soil and this deposition therefore acts \nas a fertilizer, increasing tree growth. CarboEurope-IP modelling \nstudies have shown that nitrogen deposition and atmospheric \nCO2 increase should have a strong synergistic effect on carbon \nuptake. The synergy is particularly strong when high nitrogen \ndeposition and recently-planted forest occur together.\nFederico Magnani of the University of Bologna led a research \ngroup which analysed the data from sets of different aged \nstands of the same species growing in the same forest. It was \npossible to create 20 age-sequences of forest rotation cycles. \nCalculations then gave the carbon which would be accumulated \nover the whole forest rotation and its components of photosyn-\nthesis and respiration. This accumulated carbon was compared \nwith the average annual temperature and the rate of nitrogen \ndeposition known from another study. Both photosynthesis \nand respiration were strongly correlated with average annual \n5.

The result was the confirmation of \na strong relationship between the net build up of carbon and \nthe rate of nitrogen deposition (Fig. IV.34). Federico Magnani \nsaid, \u2018The results from this research show that we are actually \ncontrolling the carbon balance of our forests by the inadvertent \naddition of nitrogen fertilizer. We believe that forests respond \nto temperature largely because microbial activity increases and \n41\nthe soil organic matter decomposes more rapidly. This releases \nmore nutrients which are needed for tree growth. By adding \nextra nitrogen through fertilizer or air pollution we throw a \nsystem which was previously in equilibrium out of balance and \nit responds by greater growth, increasing the amount of carbon \nstored in the wood and soil.\u2019 However, the magnitude of the ef-\nfect is still under discussion.\nThese findings are supported by observations and experiments \nof nitrogen deposition into European forests performed in other \nEU projects (C-NTER, NitroEurope) and data from the ICP forest \nmonitoring network (International Co-operative Programme on \nAssessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests).\nTaking these factors into account, Magnani (and his group) \nconclude that around 200 kg of carbon can be sequestered per \nkg of nitrogen deposition. In contrast, long term manipula-\ntion experiments led by de Vries, showed that only 30-70 kg \nof carbon was sequestered per kg nitrogen (20-40 kg in above-\nground biomass and 10-30 kg in soils). A critical comparison of \necosystem manipulation and observational stud-\nies could provide further insights into the key \nfactors controlling carbon-nitrogen relations in \nforest ecosystems.\n5.2 Effects of forest management\nMost European forests are managed for timber production with \nthe wood being harvested and removed. The type and intensity \nof forest management varies, depending on economic factors \nand the type and amount of timber being produced. But how \nshould they be managed to maximise their carbon uptake and \nprovide a long term store of carbon in the biomass and soil? \nAnswering this question needs new thinking and new science. \nCarboEurope-IP has compared the carbon stored by European \nbeech forests under different management systems: an age-\nclass forest with even-aged stands, a mixed-age forest in which \nsingle trees are selectively cut (selection system) and an un-\nmanaged forest (Fig. IV.35). The largest differences were found \nin tree biomass, with the unmanaged forest holding the highest \nbiomass stock of carbon. The soil in the unmanaged forest also \ncontained more carbon, although it is not clear if this differ-\nence is caused by the absence of timber extraction, by differ-\nences in historical management, or by small differences in soil \nproperties. \n5. The Impact of Added Nitrogen and Management\nRobust findings:\nWhen excluding the effects of forest age, nitrogen deposition \nfrom air pollution is the major factor controlling the forest \ncarbon sink. Up to 200 kg of carbon may be sequested per kg \nof deposited nitrogen.\nForest management of thinning affects mainly the standing \nbiomass.\nKey questions:\nHow should forest be managed to provide a long term store of \ncarbon in soils under changing environmental consitions?\nIs N-deposition a link between fossil fuel emissions, land-use \nand forest growth?\nFig. IV.35: Carbon pools in stem biomass of mixed beech \nforests on limestone (above) and in the mineral soil (SOC: \nsoil organic carbon) of mixed\/pure beech and spruce forests \non different bedrock (below) as a function of stand age and \nsilvicultural system.

Climate extremes\nIn 2003 Southern and Central Europe suffered its worse heat-\nwave in living memory. A combination of record breaking \ntemperatures and low rainfall led to a large number of human \ndeaths from heat stress, as well as to a failure of summer crops \nand forest fires. The impact of the high temperatures and lack of \nrainfall caused major changes to the vegetation, and therefore \nthe carbon cycle, across Europe.\nWhen CarboEurope-IP scientists analysed the carbon balance \nin 2003 they found that the extreme summer heat and lack of \nrainfall had resulted in the amount of carbon absorbed in plant \ngrowth being 30% less than that in normal years. The plants \nreacted to lack of water more rapidly than soil microbes, and \nphotosynthesis was reduced earlier than respiration. The net \nresult was that for 2003 the continent\u2019s land surface became \na source of CO2. Overall, the dry summer removed the equiva-\nlent of five years of carbon assimilation. Grain yields reached a \n40-year minimum in 2003 (Fig. IV.36).\nCO2 enters the leaves of plants through the same small pores \n(stomata) in their leaves through which water vapour evapo-\nrates. This means that during a drought when plants restrict \ntheir water use, they also take in less CO2. This lower absorp-\ntion of carbon reduces the supply of fresh sugars needed for \nthe chemical processes which emit CO2 as sugar is used to keep \nthe plant alive (plant respiration). When photosynthesis shuts \ndown through lack of water there is less CO2 emitted. In the \ndry soil, despite the high temperatures, there is relatively little \nmicrobial action producing CO2 by the breakdown of organic ma-\nterial. Put simply, biological processes cannot function without \nwater, and during drought the whole ecosystem shuts down. \nTrees desiccated and turned brown in Southern France in sum-\nmer and not in the autumn of 2003 (Fig. IV.37).\nExtreme events are not only important in themselves they also \ngive scientists a rare opportunity to test the robustness of their \nmodels by comparing their predictions with data collected in \nnew conditions, outside the ones for which the models were de-\nrived. Phillipe Ciais, of the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et \nde l\u2018Environnement, said, \u2018Our model predictions compared well \nwith the data collected in 2003 at the CarboEurope-IP sites. \nThis gave us the confidence to apply our carbon balance models \nto predict plant growth and crop yield over the whole continent \nof Europe. The results surprised us, and ring a warning bell for \nthe future. Extreme drought is likely to have a bigger impact on \nthe carbon balance of Europe than we had previously thought.\u2019 \nWorryingly, the conditions experienced in 2003, are likely to \nbecome normal summer conditions for plants in 50 years time. \nRecent regional climate studies indicate a higher likelihood of \nsuch heatwaves in the future, with droughts impacting regions \nwhere currently they are infrequent.\nFig. IV.37: Desiccated trees with brown leaves in Southern France in the \nsummer (not autumn) of 2003.

Extreme Events\nImpact of extremes\nThe first major impacts of climate change will occur \nthrough extreme events rather than through changes in \naverage conditions. For example, although the forests \nacross Europe are vulnerable to lower average summer \nrainfall, it will be the extremes \u2013 droughts and winds \nthat will do most damage \u2013 irreversibly destroying eco-\nsystems, or replacing one type with another. Often when \nwild-fire destroys a forest (Fig. IV.38) it is replaced by \na different type of forest or by bush-type savannah. In-\ncreases of insect outbreaks (Fig. IV.39), as triggered \nby increasing temperature and drought, may be just as \neffective in destroying the forest as fire, and the in-\ncreasing frequency of extremes of wind have devastated \nEuropean forests through windthrows (Fig. IV.40). Dur-\ning the last two centuries storms were responsible for \n53%, fire caused 16% and insect outbreaks another 16% \nof total damage. An increase of droughts is expected \nto increase the damage by fires and by insects in the \nfuture.\nThe effects of drought one year are mainly felt the fol-\nlowing year, through tree damage, reduced leaf growth, \nand changes in the carbon pools such as the timing \nand amount of leaf fall. Combinations of two sequential \ndrought years, or a dry summer being followed by a dry \nwinter, are especially dangerous. If the winter rainfall \nfollowing a drought is not sufficient to refill the soil \nmoisture store, trees may not be able to access enough \nwater to survive the second summer, becoming more \nvulnerable to forest fire and insect attack, or simply dy-\ning through lack of water. In addition, the reserves of \nsugars packed away by trees during the summer play a \ncritical role in making new leaves the next spring; insuf-\nficient sugar in the winter store will weaken the trees \nability to survive the coming summer. The full range of \nthe impacts and long term carry-over effects of extreme \ndrought are emerging from studies of wood anatomy. \n2003 has taught us a lot, about ecosystems, and the \ndamage and mortality caused by extreme events, but has \nalso shown up big gaps in our knowledge.\nCarboEurope-IP studies of 2003 have emphasised that \ndrought has the potential to become one of the most \ndamaging extreme events in nature, not only because of \nits immediate impact, but also because ecosystems that \nare currently carbon sinks could turn into carbon sourc-\nes, creating a positive feedback and amplifying climate \nchange. This prospect makes the ability and readiness to \nstudy of extreme events, such as the drought of 2003, \nan urgent research priority for the future. \nFig. IV.38: Forest fire. This fire occurred in Siberia, where fire is a natural re-orc-\ncurring event. However, recent investigations show, that more than 90% of fores \nin the boreal region are caused by humans and not by flashes. \n(Photo: E.-D.

Extreme Events\nRobust findings:\nIn the drought of 2003 the continent\u2019s land surface became a \nsource of CO2. 1 year of drought was equivalent to 5 years of \ncarbon assimilation.\nThe effects of drought one year may be felt the following year, \nthrough changes in the plant physiology and ecosytem nutri-\nent stores.\nModel predictions compared well with the data collected in \nthe extreme conditions of 2003.\nFig. IV.40: In November 2004, a storm with wind speeds up to 180 km\/h destroyed a forest strip of \n50 km length and up to 5 km wide in the Tatras National Park, Slovakia. (Photo: E.-D. Schulze)\nKey questions:\nWhat are the carry-over effects of extreme drought and \nstorm?\nWhat are the feedbacks with climate and the carbon cycle that \nmay result from extreme drought and storm?\nWhere are the tipping points that will cause irreversible eco-\nsystem change to result from extreme conditions?\nWhat are additional climate change agents?\nIntact forest\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n2005 2006 2007\nC \nst\noc\nks\n [\nt \nC \nha\n-1\n]\nFresh litter (Oi)\nModerately decomposed litter (Oe)\nWindthrow (cleared)\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n2005 2006 2007\nWindthrow (un-cleared)\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n2005 2006\nFig. IV.41: Soil carbon was lost from the organic layers (Oi and Oe) at the cleared windthrow site and at the un-cleared windthrow left for natural suc-\ncession. (Don et al., unpublished)\nAround 50% of carbon in temperate for-\nest ecosystems is stored as soil organic \ncarbon in the organic layer (forest floor) \nand in the mineral soil. The knowing the \nsusceptibility of this carbon to disrup-\ntion is fundamental to understanding \npossible negative feedbacks with the cli-\nmate. Increased frequencies of windthrow \nmay unlock carbon from the soil which \nends up as greenhouse gases in the at-\nmosphere. After a windthrow event in \nthe High Tatras in November 2004 (Fig. \nIV.40) carbon was mainly lost from the \nupper organic layers (Fig. IV.41). Soil \ncarbon stocks (organic layer and upper \nmineral soil) decreased to a minimum in \nthe cleared windthrow but even increased \nat the un-cleared windthrow site.\n45\n7. The Atmospheric Approach\n7.1 Modeling the Continental Scale European Ecosystem Carbon Balance\nThe integration of the site-specific process information gained \nin CarboEurope-IP for the estimation of the continental-wide \ncarbon balance of Europe necessitates the use of ecosystem \nmodels. In CarboEurope a spectrum of modeling approaches \nis used:  On one end  of the spectrum are diagnostic models \nwhich are calibrated at local  field sites, and which use satel-\nlite data (FPAR), vegetation  distribution and meteorological \ndata for up-scaling to the continent  based. These include an \nartificial neural network modeling approach  (NETWORK-ANN), \na canopy flux\/growth model (PIXGRO) and a semi- empirical \nradiation-use efficiency based model (MOD17+). On the other \nend of the model spectrum are fully prognostic process-based \nbiogeochemical models which attempt to compute the cycling \nof carbon through ecosystems given the prevailing vegetation \ndistribution, soil properties, land use and climate conditions \n(models: ORCHIDEE, LPJmL, Biome-BGC, JULES) (Vetter et al., \n2008). All models have been extensively evaluated at the indi-\nvidual measurement sites (Fig. IV.25). \nUsing a common continental \u201cEurogrid\u201d with resolution 0.25\u00b0 \nlatitude by 0.25\u00b0 longitude, the models were run over the his-\ntorical period 1958-2005. As an example, Figure IV.42a shows \ncomputed maps of carbon sinks and sources during the four \nseasons for the European continent. It is clear that the seasonal \ncycle is dominated in the northern part of the European conti-\nnent by the temperature, with maximum uptake during the sum-\nmer months. On the other hand, in the Mediterranean region \nthe carbon balance is governed by the availability of moisture, \nleading to maximum uptake in spring. During the growing sea-\nson, European ecosystems in the EU-25 region sequester almost \n400 Tg carbon, of which a large fraction is released again during \nthe dormant vegetation season. \nThe spatial pattern of the European ecosystem carbon sink as \ncalculated by the CarboEurope-IP biogeochemical models is \nshown in Fig. IV.42b. The continental sink pattern is domi-\nnated by uptake in the forested areas of the Alps, Scandinavia, \nEastern Europe and European Russia. These simulations take \ninto account the changing climate and the increasing atmos-\npheric CO2 concentration, but do not yet include the history of \nland-use change and management. The calculated sink strength \n(EU-25: 80 \u00b1 25 Tg C yr-1) is therefore an underestimate. \nThe calculated imprint of the drought and heat event of the \nsummer of 2003 is shown in Fig. IV.42c, which can be directly \ncompared to the decadal average summer fluxmap shown in Fig. \nIV.42a. The widespread reduction of carbon uptake over large \nparts of southern, western and central Europe is clearly visible, \neffectively reducing the June to August CO2 uptake over the \nEU-25 region by 156 Tg carbon. \n30\nW\n0\n30\nE\n60 N\n60 N\n30\nW\n0\n30\nE\n60 N\n60 N\n30\nW\n0\n30\nE\n60 N\n60 N\n30\nW\n0\n30\nE\n60 N\n60 N\nMarch - May\nSep - Nov Dec - Feb\nJun - Aug\n-100\n-50\n-5\n-20\n0\n5\n20\n50\n100\ng \nC \nm\n-2\n m\non\nth\n-1\nFig. IV.42a: Seasonal cycle of carbon uptake and release by European ecosys-\ntems as computed by the CarboEurope-IP biogeochemical models (multimodel \naverage).

CarboEurope-IP \nis putting a major effort into sampling the fluxes of these dif-\nferent land covers using observation sites on the ground. These \n\u201cflux tower\u201c sites (see Page 32) give measurements at a scale \nof a few hundred metres to a few kilometres. At the other end \nof the spectrum, continental flux is estimated using the inverse \nmodelling technique (see Page 51), which combines meteoro-\nlogical models with concentration measurements, at a scale of \nthousands of kilometres. There is an obvious gap between the \nscales of these two techniques, that currently blocks progress \nin understanding how the biosphere interacts with the overly-\ning atmosphere. Filling the gap is important because it covers \nthe regional to national scale, the scale at which community \naction can be taken: progress can be monitored, and the land-\nscape managed to enhance carbon uptake, mitigating the effect \nof carbon emissions from burning fossil fuel. Having a method \nto measure the land surface carbon balance at this scale is \nan essential complement to the measurement techniques being \ndeveloped by CarboEurope-IP in the Rhine valley. There, carbon \ndioxide emission from burning fossil fuel is being monitored at \nthe regional scale using carbon monoxide as a surrogate gas \n(see Page 54). \nThe techniques of regional scale carbon estimation are being \ndeveloped using data collected during three intensive, four to \nsix-week measurement campaigns, one in 2005 and one each \nin the spring and autumn of 2007. The experiment was held in \nsouthwest France, in an area roughly 250 x 150 km, bounded \nto the west by the Atlantic coast (Fig. IV.43). This is a rural \narea with Les Landes forest in the west, and \u201cmixed agriculture \nfarms\u201d and vineyards in the east. There is a low population \ndensity and very little emission of CO2 from burning fossil fuel. \nA dense network of CO2 surface fluxes and concentration meas-\nurements were combined with extensive measurements through \nthe atmosphere using balloons and aircraft.\nObservational campaigns of the size and complexity of the Car-\nboEurope Regional Experiment cannot be achieved by institu-\ntions, or even nations, working alone; the observational team \nwas comprised of sixteen teams coming from six nations, a co-\nordinated effort only feasible within a large, centrally-funded \nprogramme like CarboEurope-IP IP. Han Dolman of VU Univer-\nsity, Amsterdam is leading the project. He explained, \u2018The Car-\nboEurope Regional Experiment was designed to meet the ma-\njor challenge of quantifying the carbon balance at the missing \nregional scale. We need to find out how to combine the plot \nscale data, from flux measurement and carbon inventories, with \nthe observed CO2 concentration fields, and how these relate to \nthe predictions down-scaled from continental-scale models. The \nbreakthrough will come when we can understand the role of the \nregional meteorology and land management in controlling the \nfluxes from land to atmosphere.

This makes a one-dimensional approach to interpreting \nconcentration measurements inappropriate. Only when a three-\ndimensional approach is used do the observations make sense. \nYet, the measurements themselves have shown that interaction \nof three dimensional air flows with the surface is quite complex \nabove heterogeneous surfaces. The finding that one needs such \na full three-dimensional picture of the flux and concentrations \nat mesoscales, i.e. horizontal scales less than 10 km, has im-\nportant implications for the use of concentration observations \nabove the land. Their interpretation in large-scale inversion \nmodels may only yield meaningful results if this three-dimen-\nsional regional context is taken into account. \nAtmospheric regional-scale models are in routine use for short \nterm weather forecasting, and they include packages for model-\nling evaporation and the land surface energy balance. In the \nproject these models were extended to estimating carbon fluxes \nusing a network of concentration measurements as the driving \ndata. Almost certainly the network of air sampling stations will \nbe inadequate over most of Europe, but the dense network used \nin the CarboEurope-IP experiment is allowing us to find out \nwhat density of observations will give an acceptably accurate \nanswer. The technique might then be applied routinely. As Joel \nNoilhan, of M\u00e9t\u00e9o France, Toulouse explains, \u2018Our ultimate ob-\njective is to be issuing the equivalent of weather forecasts for \ncarbon. If we could produce regional maps identifying the sinks \nand sources we would be able to add these over time to give \nthe accumulated regional carbon balance. Just as we can now \ngive the climatological-averages of temperature and rainfall for \nany location \u2013 so in the future we want to be able to give the \nclimatological-average carbon balance and, most important, \nhow it is changing with time.\u2019\nThese average fluxes of carbon would not just be for scientific \ninterest - they would be an important tool for verifying progress \ntowards meeting international carbon targets and for guiding \npolicy. Han Dolman said, \u2018If we are to mitigate CO2 build up in \nthe atmosphere by land management we need to know where in-\nterventions will be most effective. Combining regional networks \nof accurate CO2 concentration measurements with regional-scale \nmeteorological models is the way forward.\u2019\nThe CarboEurope Regional Experiment has created a pow-\nerful data set which is providing new insights into how the \nvery mixed landscape of Europe interacts with the atmosphere. \nMeasurements have shown that the CO2 concentration can be \nhighly variable in space and time, and responds to a complex \ncombination of surface-atmosphere interactions.\n7.2 The CarboEurope Regional Experiment\nFig. IV.44: Schematic description of the main physical processes along a vertical west-east cross section on 27 May around 14:00 Universal Time (UTC): the \nhigher Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) above the pine forest is due to a greater sensible heat flux. The CO2 concentration slightly increases in the ABL \ndue to advection of CO2 by the sea breeze and because of a small CO2 surface flux into the surface. The ABL height decreases over the eastern crops where \nthe sensible heat is weak. The CO2 concentration in the ABL decreases remarkably over the winter crops area characterized by a high assimilation rate. Over \nthe summer crops, despite a relatively small assimilation rate, the CO2 concentration remains low due to horizontal advection of a CO2 poor air mass from the \nsoutheast.

Light aircraft are ideally suited to \nthe regional scale of measurement and the \ndata they collected gave new insight into \nhow the CO2 fluxes at the surface are related \nto the concentration of CO2 in the air above.\nAircraft were fitted out with new equipment \nwhich can make high precision measurements \nof CO2 concentration in situ, either along \ntransects or as the aircraft spirals up through \nthe boundary layer. At the same time sam-\nples of air were taken for later high-precision \nanalysis of its composition in terms of trace \ngases such as nitrous oxide (N2O), methane \n(CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO), and their \nisotopic composition.\nStationary measurements from flux towers are continuous in \ntime, but sample only a relatively small area of vegetation. In \ncontrast, when similar instruments are mounted on low flying \naircraft, flying through the turbulence, the aircraft can take a \n\u201csnap-shot\u201c of the fluxes from a large area of upwind vegeta-\ntion. A first for the CarboEurope Regional Experiment was to \nfly two aircraft in parallel trajectories one above the other, \nwith the lowest only 50 to 100 metres above the surface. This \ngives more accurate simulations of the surface flux as account \ncan be taken of the changes in CO2 concentration with height \n(Fig. IV.46).\nFig. IV.45: SkyArrow: An aircraft operated to measure fluxes between the atmosphere and land \nsurfaces for CarboEurope-IP.

The measurements of concentration reflect \nthe complex history of air movement over the landscape. The \nimplications of this finding are profound: the regional scale \nmeteorology is complex and the simple one-dimensional mod-\nels in common use are not appropriate.

Aircraft flying across the experimental domain found a re-\nmarkable difference in CO2 concentration between the air above \nthe pine forest of Les Landes and the air above the agricultural \narea to the east (Fig. IV.44). The difference, of 10 ppm, was \nconsistent with the difference in flux measurements made at \nthe surface. At that time of year, the agricultural crops, particu-\nlarly the winter-sown cereals, were growing fast and drawing \ndown a large flux of CO2 as they photosynthesise. In contrast, \nfor the forest photosynthesis and respiration were more closely \nmatched: less CO2 was drawn down from the atmosphere and the \nconcentration was therefore higher. The difference was ampli-\nfied by the fact that the well-mixed, convective boundary layer \nabove the crops was relatively shallow and the CO2 being used \nby the crops was therefore being drawn from a smaller volume \nof air than that available to the forest.\nA high-resolution three-dimensional meteorological model, \nwith CO2 flux estimation capability, predicted the observed be-\nhaviour well and was able to demonstrate the complex influence \nof the land surface on the CO2 budget over the whole region. \nThe model showed how the markedly different fluxes from for-\nest, winter-sown and summer-sown crops, interacted with the \nlocal atmospheric circulation such as the sea breeze, caused by \ndifferences in the atmospheric convection over the sea, the for-\nest and the agricultural land. \nIn a critical trial of the inverse modelling approach (see Page \n48), an atmospheric scalar transport model was used to track \nthe movement of CO2 across the experimental domain. The best \nfit of the model to the CO2 concentration data observed on tall \ntowers (>200m tall TV-towers equipped with CarboEurope-IP \nmeasuring systems, see Page 50), produced a large correction \nto be applied to the original model estimates of the fluxes, but \nthe resultant values were closer to the observations over agri-\ncultural, forest, and urban areas. Independent validation was \ndone using aircraft-observed concentration differences across \nthe region. The resulting improved regional carbon budget \nquantification demonstrates the value of the combined top-\ndown\/bottom-up methodology and the validity of the inverse \nmodelling approach at the meso scale.\nThe Regional Experiment was associated with a proposed sat-\nellite mission FLEX. The European Space Agency funded field \ncampaign CEFLES2 brought together a multi-national campaign \nexploiting the synergies between large scale and concomitant \nairborne and ground measurements performed in coordination \nwith CERES (CarboEurope Regional Experiment Strategy). Syn-\nchronized airborne and ground measurements were acquired in \nApril, June and September 2007 to capture different growth \nstages of a variety of vegetation types. Airborne measure-\nments comprise carbon, heat and water fluxes, fluorescence and \nhyper-spectral imagery covering the visible, near-, shortwave- \nand thermal-infrared wavelengths. The campaign aimed for a \ncomplete understanding of the link between carbon uptake and \nfluorescence emission from the scale of single leaves to the \nregion. First results proved that indeed canopy fluorescence is \nclosely correlated with ecosystem carbon uptake and that fluo-\nrescence data improve diurnal model predictions of GPP. On the \nregional scale the fluorescence signal could be correlated to \nregional airborne measurements of carbon fluxes. Fluorescence \nmaps (Fig. IV.47) are currently being refined to extrapolate and \ntest the improvement of regional carbon and water models on \nthe inclusion of fluorescence\n7.2 The CarboEurope Regional Experiment\nRobust findings:\nThe column of air above any point cannot be simply related to \nthe flux at the surface.\nOne-dimensional models are not appropriate; three dimension-\nal models are needed to represent complex landscapes.\nRegional scale inverse modelling with an atmospheric scalar \ntransport model can reveal how the sources and sinks of car-\nbon are distributed.\nKey questions:\nHow do we relate surface fluxes to atmospheric composition?\nWhat is the minimum monitoring network needed to derive \nmaps of the regional scale carbon balance?\nHow do we move from research to operations in region scale \ncarbon modelling?\nFig. IV.47: Map of sun-induced fluorescence showing the photosynthetic ef-\nficiency of different fields at an agricultural area by Marmande (Southern \nFrance).

(Photo: M. Heimann)\n7.3 Atmospheric CO2\nThe high variability of the European \nlandscape is reflected in an equally \nspatially variable terrestrial carbon \nbalance, but because the global \natmosphere is so well-mixed the \neffect of different surface fluxes \non the atmospheric concentration \nof CO2 is soon removed. Yet, small \nsystematic differences can be ob-\nserved: when the wind is blowing \nfrom the Atlantic, air in central Eu-\nrope will typically have CO2 concen-\ntrations 2 to 5 ppm greater than air \non the west coast (the background \nlevel of CO2 is currently about 380 \nppm). CarboEurope-IP is measuring \nthis variation in CO2 concentration \nby making continuous, accurate \nmeasurements at about 46 sites \nacross Europe (Fig. IV.48). Many \nof these measurements are made \non tall towers (Fig. IV.49,50): tall \nenough (200 to 300 m) to avoid \nthe local effects of small surface \nheterogeneities, but able to map \nthe change in CO2 concentration as \nthe air moves across the landscape. \nInverse modelling (see Page 51) \ncan then be used to deduce the \nmost likely field of surface fluxes \nto have produced this pattern.\n7.3 CO2 Concentration and Fluxes\nFig. IV.49: Footprint of the 9 European Tall Towers.\nFig. IV.48: Atmospheric measurement sites in CarboEurope-IP.\n13 Continuous Sites\n9 Tall Tower\n24 Aircraft-Flask-Sampling Sites\n69\u00baN\n66\u00baN\n63\u00baN\n60\u00baN\n57\u00baN\n54\u00baN\n51\u00baN\n48\u00baN\n45\u00baN\n42\u00baN\n39\u00baN\n36\u00baN\n15\u00baW 10\u00baW 5\u00baW 0\u00baW 5\u00baE 10\u00baE 15\u00baE 20\u00baE 25\u00baE 30\u00baE 35\u00baE 40\u00baE\n25 50 100 150 200 300 400 500 600\n(1\/1000) * Explained Variance\n9 Tall Towers\nLa Muela, ES\nHegyhatsal, HU\nCabauw, NL\nOrl\u00e9ans, F\nOchsenkopf, D\nBialystok, PL\nAngus\/Edinbg., UK\nFirenze, I\nNorunda, S\n51\nThis inverse modelling technique (see Box) has been applied to \nproduce maps of the monthly carbon budget of Europe. All the \nprocesses are included: oceanic fluxes, land surface fluxes, fos-\nsil fuel burning and wild fires \u2013 the maps show the net budget. \nTwo examples shown in the figure illustrate how the carbon \nbudget changes with season (Fig. IV.51). In January 2004 the \nwhole continent was a source of CO2, with the carbon balance \ndominated by respiration as soil microbes continued to break \ndown dead plant material, but low light and short day length in-\nhibited photosynthesis. Fossil fuel burning is also at its great-\nest at that time of year. In summer the situation is reversed \nand in June 2004 photosynthesis is dominant over the whole \ncontinent. The far northern regions of Scandinavia and Russia \nhave a similar carbon up-take rate to central Europe as the \nlonger day length at high latitudes compensates for the lower \nlevels of solar radiation.\nThe map in August 2003 is revealing. The drought (see also \nPage 42) has caused the photosynthesis in southern Europe to \ndecrease to the extent that respiration dominates and forest \nfires add to further emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere.\nThis inverse modelling methodology is still in its infancy. There \nare large differences between the estimates of different models \nand the uncertainty in their calculations of the carbon budget is \nlarge. Nevertheless, as CarboEurope-IP measurements challenge \nthese models with real data, they are progressively improving. \nCarboEurope-IP scientists see the method moving from the re-\nsearch to the operational level, with the network of concentra-\ntion and flux measurements becoming routine (see Page 53). \n7.3 CO2 Concentration and Fluxes\nFig. IV.51: Maps of Europe showing modelled sources and sinks of CO2 as on \nhttp:\/\/inversions.lsce.ipsl.fr\/index.php.\n(1) The net carbon flux for the months of January and June 2004.

If the \nsurface is a source, the air will be relatively richer in CO2; \nif the surface is a sink, the air will be relatively deficient \nin CO2. This process can be realistically simulated by three-\ndimensional atmospheric transport models, with the help of \nweather pattern analyses. Such models therefore establish a \nlink between the pattern of surface CO2 flux to be inferred \nand the concentrations measured on tall tower, air monitor-\ning stations. From this numerical link, the technique known \nas \u2018inverse modelling\u2019 explores the space of the plausible \nflux patterns to best match the measurements. The more \nmeasurements of concentration there are, the more accurate \nwill be such a statistical prediction of the flux field which \ncreated it.\nAs Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chevallier of the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat \net de l\u2018Environnement, Gif-sur-Yvette said, \u2018For the future we \nmust integrate the carbon concentration measurements with \nthe flux measurements in a new data system, using satellite \ndata in addition to in situ observations to inform the model \nabout the state of the vegetation and atmosphere. We need to \nmerge all the data available to give the best possible estimate \nof the carbon balance with the lowest possible uncertainty.\u2019\n52\n7.3 CO2 Concentration and Fluxes\nAn atmospheric signal for changing conditions over Europe\nThe atmospheric network of CarboEurope-IP monitors the CO2 \nconcentrations at stations along the Atlantic coast, on Atlan-\ntic islands, and inland (Fig. IV.52,53). The continuous hourly \nrecords revealed that for the time period between 1992 and \n1999 there was a relatively constant positive West-East dif-\nference of atmospheric CO2 across Europe, reflecting the emis-\nsion of CO2 over the continent (Fig. IV.54). However, since \nabout 1999 the difference has been increasing for most inland \nstations. Obviously something novel is going on. Either, the \nsink of the land surface has decreased, perhaps due to global \nwarming, or, the emissions over Europe have increased rather \nthan decreased. An alternative explanation is that the circula-\ntion patterns of air masses have systematically changed. All \nthree possible causes would be worrying, but more research is \nneeded to fully understand this puzzling observation.\nFig. IV.54: CO2 concentration difference between Mace Head and various \ncontinental stations.

ICOS will \nprovide the long-term observations required to assess the ef-\nfectiveness of carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas reduc-\ntion activities on levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases. It \nwill also identify sources and sinks of greenhouse gases at the \nregional and ecosystem level. Monitoring how sinks develop \nin the future has immediate implications for reduction efforts. \nMore biospheric sinks implies that less severe emission reduc-\ntion efforts will be required to attain stable levels of CO2.\nICOS is based on the techniques and designs pioneered in \nCarboEurope-IP with a combination of atmospheric concentra-\ntion measurements of long-lived greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, \nN2O and related isotopic tracers) and measurements of gas, \nenergy and water fluxes from ecosystems, with inventories of \ncarbon and nitrogen stocks and the relevant \nphysical and chemical ecosystem properties. \nThese two types of measurements comple-\nment each other because the variations of \natmospheric trace gas concentrations are \ncontrolled by surface fluxes through atmos-\npheric transport processes.\nAtmospheric measurements integrate fluxes \nover very large regions, while ecosystem \nmeasurements represent very small regions. \nThe gap in scale between those two data-\nstreams is bridged using ecosystem models \nand atmospheric transport models which \nact as \u2018intelligent interpolators\u2019 for produc-\ning the required greenhouse gas sources and \nsinks distribution.\nFig. IV.55: Organization of the ICOS infrastructure, a \nproject originating from CarboEurope-IP research. \nAtmospheric\nCo-ordination\nCentre\nGas \nStandards\nEcosystem\nCo-ordination\nCentre\nData Centre\nCouncil of Scientific\nSteering Institutions\nICOS Centre\nAtmospheric\nObservation \nNetwork\nEcosystem\nObservation\nNetwork\nScientific Users\nInventories, Assessments\nData DataCalibration\nQuality control\nTraining\nInstrument upgrades\nQuality control\nGas analysis\nGlobal Observation Networks\nTraining\nInstrument upgrades\nAlthough ICOS will be a distributed infrastructure with a mul-\ntitude of measurement sites, two thematic centres are planned \nto co-ordinate and standardise the atmospheric and ecologi-\ncal observations (Fig. IV.55). A central analytical laboratory \nwill take care of all the necessary analyses (trace gas con-\ncentrations and isotope measurements) on flask air samples \ntaken at the various sites. In this way ICOS will implement \nand maintain a co-ordinated, long-term, high-quality network \nof atmospheric and ecosystem observations. \nFunding is secure for the starting phase but needs to be nego-\ntiated with the participating nations thereafter. In any case, \nICOS will create a sustainable network that can operate with \nsecured funding for more than 10-20 years, thus assuring the \ncontinuity of data that is needed to detect systematic trends \nand anomalies in the concentrations of the major greenhouse \ngases.\nRobust findings:\nThe need for atmospheric measurements is based on the need \nfor verification. There will always be a need for independent \nmonitoring and analysis of the larger scale carbon cycle. This \nis to (a) verify that reported emissions and claimed seques-\ntration efforts are reflected in the atmospheric total and (b) \nensure that there are no surprises in the global carbon cycle \nthat would require policies and reduction targets to be re-\nvised. \nKey questions:\nHow do we move the network of concentration and flux meas-\nurements from the research to the routine, operational level?\nHow do we improve the vertical mixing component of trans-\nport models in the predicted fields of carbon flux?\nHow do we merge all the data available to give the best pos-\nsible estimate of the carbon balance with reasonable uncer-\ntainty and spatial resolution?\n54\nFossil fuel emissions\nRadiocarbon has long been used to date archaeological finds \n(see Box), but a similar technique can also be used to measure \nthe emissions of CO2 resulting from fossil fuel burning. Because \nCO2 generated by fossil fuel burning is free of carbon-14 (ra-\ndiocarbon or 14C), comparing the high-precision measurements \nof the background concentration of carbon-14 made high in \nthe atmosphere, with that found near the surface, allows the \nregional emission of CO2 from fossil fuel to be detected. \nThe background level of 14CO2 is measured routinely at only \ntwo sites in Europe. One, the Jungfraujoch research station, \nis located high in the Swiss alps, where the air can be taken \nto represent the unpolluted free atmosphere over Europe. Car-\nboEurope-IP compared measurements from Jungfraujoch with \ntwo sets of similar measurements, one made in Heidelberg in \nthe upper Rhine valley in Germany (Fig. IV.56,57), typical of \na highly populated and polluted region; the other only slightly \npolluted on the Schauinsland mountain in the Black Forest. The \nresults show that the air at both sites almost always has smaller \n14CO2\/CO2 ratios than that at the high alpine observatory, be-\ncause the air becomes diluted with 14CO2-free gas released from \nfossil fuel burning (Fig. IV.58). The dilution was found to be \neight times greater at the urban site than at the Black Forest \nsite. As expected, the input of CO2 from fossil fuel burning also \nvaries with the time of year, with the largest difference being \nfound at the urban site in the winter, when electricity and fuel \nuse are greatest.\nCarboEurope-IP scientists analysed data from 1986 to 2006 and \nlooked to see how the input of CO2 generated by fossil fuel burn-\ning had changed. Team leader Ingeborg Levin explained \u2018Radio-\ncarbon measurements are the most direct and accurate method \nof measuring the impact of fossil fuel CO2 emissions in the at-\nmosphere, and our precise measurements of carbon-14 dilution \nwould detect any trend in emissions larger than 10% at a site \nlike Heidelberg\u2019. The results showed no significant trend in the \ngeneration of CO2 by fossil fuel burning. Even though Germany \nhas reduced its CO2 emissions by 18% in this period, the meas-\nurements show that the reductions have been made elsewhere, \nnot in Southwest Germany. The regional resolution is important \nif we intend to share the burden of fossil fuel reductions (Fig. \nIV.59).\n7.4 Fossil Fuel Emissions\nCarbon-14\nCarbon-14, radiocarbon, or 14C, is the very rare radioactive \nisotope of the element carbon (the common isotope is car-\nbon-12, or 12C). The two isotopes have the same chemical \nproperties, but the atoms of 14C are heavier. 14C is constantly \nproduced by the action of cosmic rays in the upper atmos-\nphere and combines with oxygen to form a \u201cheavy\u201d carbon \ndioxide. The ratio of 14CO2 to \n12CO2 in an unpolluted atmos-\nphere is changing slightly, but the rate of production is ef-\nfectively in equilibrium with the rate of absorption by the \noceans and by plants. But 14C is unstable and over thousands \nof years slowly decays: CO2 captured today in biological ma-\nterial will have the same ratio of 14C to 12C as found in the at-\nmosphere, but as this ratio slowly declines over time, ancient \nartefacts made from biological material have a lower ratio. \nThis process, radioactive decay, is used to date finds from \narchaeological sites. Fossil fuels were originally living organ-\nisms, but because they are millions of years old now contain \nno 14C. Burning fossil fuel therefore releases 14C-free carbon \ndioxide that dilutes the natural 14CO2\/\n12CO2 ratio in the at-\nmosphere and effectively labels the air by its lack of 14C.\nFigure IV.57: 14CO2 counting system of the Heidelberg Radiocarbon Laboratory. \n(Photo: B.

The method uses a simple observational \napproach, combining the accurate, but sparse, network of car-\nbon-14 measurements, with more widely available and less ex-\npensive measurements of carbon monoxide concentrations. \nCarbon-14 analysis (see page 54) currently gives the most \ndirect and accurate estimates of regional CO2 emission from \nfossil fuel burning. But these measurements are expensive and \nslow, and are therefore limited to only a few sites, which pro-\nvide data only at monthly or, at best, weekly intervals. \nCarbon monoxide, CO, is also produced when fossil fuels are \nburnt, and it may also be possible to deduce the amount of \nfuel burnt and therefore CO2 emission from the concentration \nof CO in the atmosphere. Although CO is relatively easy to \nmeasure, unfortunately it is a reactive gas with many sources \nand sinks. The ratio of CO to CO2 formed during combustion \nalso depends on the process, for example more CO is produced \nby petrol engines than by diesels. The ratio of CO to CO2 is thus \nhighly variable, creating a problem in using the level of CO to \naccurately estimate fossil fuel CO2. \nNevertheless, this problem can be avoided by using an ob-\nservation-based approach whereby a single sample of gas ac-\ncumulated over a week is analysed in total for 14CO2, but the \ndata are then combined with continuous observations of CO. \nBy making the simple assumption that the average ratio of CO \nto CO2 emission from fossil fuel burning is constant over the \nweekly period, the continuous CO record can be used to give \nhourly estimates of the CO2 being emitted from burning fos-\nsil fuel. The method was tested during a series of two-week \nlong sampling campaigns held in parallel to the routine 14CO2 \nmeasurements made in Heidelberg. There was good agreement \nbetween the indirect CO-based estimates and those derived \ndirectly from 14C analysis.\nThe ratio of CO to fossil fuel CO2 varies over the year by about \nplus or minus 20%, reflecting the change in use of different \nenergy needs, such as domestic heating, electricity generation \nand transport. Frequent calibration of the ratio is therefore \nnecessary. Interestingly, the ratio measured at Heidelberg has \nalready been observed to change by 20% over the past 5 years. \nThis could be a consequence of the introduction of more strin-\ngent European CO emission standards during this period. \nCalibration of continuous CO measurements opens up the pos-\nsibility of creating hourly resolution maps of fossil fuel use for \nthe whole of Europe, based on observations of the atmosphere \nitself. \u2018These results demonstrate that we now have the ability \nto monitor our regional CO2 emissions\u2019, said Annette Freibauer, \nCarboEurope-IP scientific coordinator. \u2018This technique allows \nindividual regions to take ownership of their greenhouse gas \nemissions and monitor their progress in meeting emission re-\nduction targets\u2019.\n57\nThe baseline was published in Science in 2003 (Janssens et al., \n2003), when a review of available knowledge revealed a net car-\nbon sink for CO2 over Europe of some 205 (top-down predictions) \nor 135 (bottom-up predictions) Tg C yr-1. The uncertainties in \nthese estimates were large, about 250%. In the most recent \nestimates the predicted carbon sink has increased to 329 (top-\ndown) and 288 (bottom-up) Tg C yr-1 (average: 309 TgCyr-1). \nHowever, including the greenhouse warming potential of non-\nCO2 greenhouse gases (methane, CH4, and nitrous oxide, N2O) as \ncarbon-equivalents reduces the top-down GHG-balance to 140 \nTg C-CO2eq yr\n-1 and the bottom-up balance to 44 Tg C-CO2eq \nyr-1 (100yr horizon) averaging 92 Tg C-CO2eq yr\n-1. The carbon-\nequivalent emissions of CH4 and N2O increased the carbon emis-\nsions of fossil fuels by 13%. About 50% of the continental CH4 \nand N2O emissions originate from agriculture, but for the EU-25 \nthe agricultural fraction rises to 62%. About 80% of the conti-\nnental fossil fuel emissions and about 90% of the EU-25 fossil \nfuel emissions remain in the atmosphere, to be taken up by the \nocean or contribute to global warming. The mitigation poten-\ntial of the terrestrial vegetation is thus not realised because of \nthe greenhouse gas emissions by intensive agriculture.\nThese numbers should be regarded as \u201cbest estimates\u201d, made \nusing all available data and the best models available. As Ivan \nJanssens from the University of Antwerp said: \u2018I guess numbers \nwill continue to fluctuate for a couple more years as the analy-\nses become more realistic and complete. For now, we should \nsupport our new best numbers.\u2019\nA comparative assessment of the main land-use types is best \nachieved by showing the flow of carbon through these ecosys-\ntems (Fig. IV.61). For this, we need to compare the carbon in-\nput (gross primary productivity: GPP), the respiration of plants \n(Ra), the biomass growth rates (net primary productivity: NPP), \nthe rates of harvest and other disturbances (fire), the inputs to \nthe soil by litter and manure, and the losses by microbial respi-\nration (heterotrophic respiration: Rh) and organic carbon dis-\nsolved in water draining from the soil (DOC). The result of this \nbalance is the net biome productivity (NBP) of the CO2 carbon-\ncycle. This NBP appears as changes in the permanent biomass \nof forests (NPBbiomass) and as changes in soil carbon (NBPCO2 soil). \nThese changes can either be positive, which would be a carbon \nsink, or negative, which would indicate a carbon source.\nLand-management also leads to emissions of non-CO2 green-\nhouse gases. The warming potential of these other gases can \nbe expressed as a CO2-equivalent, which must then be subtract-\ned from the NBPCO2 balance. The resultant balance is termed \nNBPGHG.\nComparing forests (Fig. IV.61a), grasslands (Fig. IV.61b) and \ncroplands (Fig. IV.61c), it emerges that as a European average, \nthe carbon input (GPP) is about 20% higher in grasslands than \nin crops and forests. Crops and forests have surprisingly similar \nGPP despite the fact that croplands grow in more favourable \nclimatic regions and on better soils than forests. Grasslands and \ncrops also receive fertilisers, which are not applied to forests.\nThe carbon needed for plant respiration also differs between \nland-use types, with croplands having the highest level of plant \nrespiration. Comparing growth of biomass, as expressed by NPP, \ngrasslands are the winners, with average biomass NPP being \nabout 30% higher in grasslands than in forests and in crops. \nBut, because most of the aboveground biomass is harvested in \ncrops and grasslands, only in forests do we observe an increase \nin the standing biomass (NBPbiomass). In crops and grasslands \nthe un-harvested residues and roots enter the soil. In addition, \ngrasslands and crops receive extra carbon from manure. The to-\ntal carbon input into soils is largest in grasslands, in part due to \nthe high growth rate of roots. Most of this soil carbon input is \ndecomposed by microbes, but the small fraction which remains, \ngenerally known as humus, increases the soil carbon content. \nThe formation of humus is the ultimate long-term sink in the \ncarbon cycle. It is likely to be highest in grasslands. The rate \nof soil carbon sequestration by forests is only one third of that \n8.

Croplands emerge as a small carbon \nsource, depleting the soil carbon which has been accumulated \nover the past millennia. However, including the non-CO2 car-\nbon gases (methane and volatile organic compounds) changes \nthe effective balance, with the emissions from crops increasing \nfurther. The non-CO2 carbon emissions from grasslands eat up \nmost of their positive CO2 balance, with their overall carbon-\nequivalent warming potential becoming about the same as for-\nests. Only forests emit minute amounts of non-CO2 gases. The \neffect of N2O emissions is not included in the diagram of the \necosystem carbon flow.\nIn summary, NBP is highest in forests and negative in crop-\nlands. However, the main part of this forest-NBP accumulates in \nabove-ground biomass which is vulnerable to future harvest.\nThe data shown in Fig. IV.61 are the basis for the develop-\nment of the bottom-up carbon budget for the whole of Europe. \nIt should be made clear, that while the ecosystem data take \ninto account variations in soil fertility, management intensity \nand crop types, they assume that the mix of soil fertility and \nmanagement types is constant across Europe. We recognise that \nthis is unlikely to be true. The uncertainty in this assumption \nis probably largest in croplands, because the model was devel-\noped using data from western Europe, where most croplands are \nmanaged more intensively than in eastern Europe. However, in \nfuture this difference may reduce if levels of fertiliser applica-\ntion in eastern Europe rise to the levels currently applied in \nwestern Europe.\n8. The Carbon Balance of Europe\nTable 2 summarises the European carbon balance, comparing \nestimates based on separate and independent assessments (i) \nof atmospheric measurements and inverse modelling, and (ii) of \nland surface measurements and inventories of the main land-use \ntypes of forest, grassland and cropland. The atmospheric top-\ndown estimates are based on a mass balance, assuming that: \nfossil fuel emissions and trade are balanced by change in the \natmosphere and in ecosystems.\nIn this context, and for the purpose of the comparison with \nthe bottom-up approach, the calculated terrestrial sinks are ex-\npressed as positive numbers. Figure IV.62 shows the distribu-\ntion of this CO2-sink across Europe. Table 2 also includes the \nclimate forcing by CO2-equivalents of C-containing and non-CO2 \ngreenhouse gases. We present only a qualitative estimate of the \nuncertainty because it was impossible to propagate all errors \nacross methods.\nUsing current knowledge, the average terrestrial CO2 sink esti-\nmated for continental Europe in CarboEurope-IP appears larger \nin 2008 than that published in 2003 (300 versus 170 Tg yr-1). \nAt the same time, the uncertainty has decreased. The fact that \nboth the top-down as well as the bottom-up estimates indicate \nan increased CO2 sink might suggest that this is a real increase. \nMore likely it is only a result of an increased understanding of \nthe carbon cycle. Lateral transport in the atmosphere and in \nsurface waters, trade, land-use change, and non-CO2 gases are \nnew processes which were not included in the 2003 balance.\nThe European carbon \nbalance sheet\nContinen-\ntal Europe\nContinental Europe\nOld estimate by\nJanssens et al. 2003\nContinental Europe\nNew estimate by\nCarboEurope-IP\nEU-25\nEU-25\nNew estimate by\nCarboEurope-IP\nArea \n(Million km2)\nNBP \n(Tg C yr-1)\nRelative  \nuncertainty\nNBP\n(Tg C yr-1)\nRelative  \nuncertainty\nArea\n(Million km2)\nNBP\n(Tg C yr-1)\nRelative  \nuncertainty\nTop-down CO2-C fluxes\nNet inversions CO2-C flux -1665 * -1272 ** -947 **\nFossil fuel CO2-C emissions -1870 -1600 ** -1060 **\nCarbon trade balance -20 ** -24 **\nCarbon exports by rivers to ocean 26 ** 10 **\nTop-down ecosystem CO2-C flux 205 * 322 * 127 *\nTop-down CH4 C-CO2eq + other C gases (1, 2) -76 ** -32 **\nTop-down N2O flux (1, 2) -113 ** -90 **\nTop-down ecosystem GHG sink \n(CO2+CH4+N2O)\n133 * 5 *\n59\n8.

The estimated forest sink \nhas decreased. At the same time the large losses from croplands \ncould not be confirmed. Forests remain as the main carbon sink \nin Europe, mainly due to the continuing accumulation of stand-\ning biomass. The effects of land-use changes, which appear to \nincrease the total sink, are rather uncertain. \nThe magnitude of the CO2-sink estimated from atmospheric \nmeasurements is very close to that estimated by ground-based \nmeasurements. Compared to the 2003 estimate, the difference \nbetween the two approaches has become smaller. Almost 60% \nof the European CO2 carbon sink is located in eastern Europe, \nmainly in the forests of European Russia. However, peat mining \ncontributes substantially to carbon losses in Eastern Europe. \nWhen including non-CO2 greenhouse gases, the total continen-\ntal sink (100%) is located in eastern Europe. \nIncluding the non-CO2 greenhouse gases methane, CH4, and ni-\ntrous oxide, N2O, into the balance changes the total sink of \nradiative forcing substantially. We define NGB as the resultant \nNet Greenhouse Balance. NGB was determined from atmospheric \nmeasurements, NBGat, and from ecosystem measurements, NGBec. \nThe difference is probably due to oxidation of methane in the \natmosphere. Methane and N2O reduce the continental CO2 sink \nby about 60% (top-down) and about 90% (bottom-up). The \nresultant NGB of continental Europe is very small (average 81; \ntop-down: 133; bottom-up: 29 Tg C-CO2eq yr\n-1,100 yr horizon). \nIncluding CH4 and N2O makes the EU-25 land surface carbon-\nneutral or even slightly negative. The non-CO2 gases act as the \nequivalent of a \u201ctoll\u201d taken by the nitrogen cycle on the pro-\nductivity of biomes. In this case the \u201ctoll\u201d is as high as the \nproductivity.\nThe average terrestrial CO2-sink is small compared to the total \nfossil fuel emissions. It compensates for about 20% of the fossil \nfuel use in continental Europe and 13% of fossil fuel emissions \nin the EU-25. The lower fossil fuel use in eastern Europe as \ncompared to the EU-25, and a relatively high terrestrial CO2-\nsink, improves the eastern European balance. Compared to the \ntotal emission of greenhouse gases (fossil fuel plus CH4 and \nN2O carbon-equivalents) the terrestrial CO2-sink is even smaller \n(about 17% for continental Europe; 11% for the EU-25). \nThe high uncertainty of these estimates appears to be an inher-\nent property of the system. The technical uncertainties have \nbeen reduced by standardisation of methodologies. Neverthe-\nless, the heterogeneity of the European landscape and the di-\nversity of soils and habitats remain as a source of inherent \nvariation. Even with 100 flux towers this variation is not fully \ncovered. Obviously inventories, models, flux towers and atmos-\npheric measurements are all needed to derive the continental \ncarbon balance.\nCarboEurope has successfully pioneered the simultaneous ap-\nplication of the bottom-up and the top-down approaches at the \ncontinental scale for CO2 and non-CO2-gases. The close match \nfound between the two estimates gives major confidence to the \nresult. It also points at the urgent need for an Integrated Car-\nbon Observing System, ICOS, across Europe (see Page 53).\n8. The Carbon Balance of Europe\n61\n8. The Carbon Balance of Europe\nRobust findings:\nContinental Europe is a CO2-carbon sink averaging 300 Tg C yr\n-1 \n(322 Tg C yr-1 based on the top-down approach and 278 Tg C  yr-1 \nbased on the bottom-up approach). About 80% of the conti-\nnental fossil fuel emissions and about 90% of the EU-25 fossil \nfuel emissions remain in the atmosphere to be taken up by the \nocean or contribute to global warming. The mitigation poten-\ntial of the terrestrial vegetation is not realised because of the \ngreenhouse gas emissions by intensive agriculture.\nIncluding non-CO2 greenhouse gases reduces the continental \nterrestrial sink by about 70% to 81 Tg C-CO2eq yr\n-1, 100yr \nhorizon. The EU-25 carbon-equivalent greenhouse gas balance \nis even slightly negative. The non-CO2 gases act as the equiva-\nlent of a \u201ctoll\u201d taken on the productivity of the biomes. In this \ncase the \u201ctoll\u201d is as high as the productivity.\nThe non-CO2 gas emissions increase the greenhouse gas emis-\nsions compared to fossil fuels about 10% (1600 Tg C yr-1 of \nfossil fuel emission in 2005; 1700 Tg C-CO2eq yr\n-1 carbon-\nequivalent greenhouse gas emissions plus fossil fuel).\nAgriculture causes about 50% of the continental total carbon-\nequivalent emissions of CH4 and N2O and 62% of the carbon-\nequivalent GHG emissions in the EU-25. \nAlmost 60% of the European CO2-carbon sink is located in \nRussian forests and grasslands. Including non-CO2 greenhouse \ngases, the entire continental sink (100%) is located in Eastern \nEurope. The EU-25 is carbon neutral.\nThe average continental terrestrial CO2-carbon sink is 20% of \nthe fossil fuel emissions in 2005, and only 13% of the fossil \nfuel emissions of EU-25. The terrestrial CO2 sink is only 17% \nof the continental total greenhouse gas emissions (300 of \n1700 Tg C yr-1), and only 11% of the EU-25 total greenhouse \ngas emissions (129 of 1116 Tg C yr-1).\nThe estimated size of the CO2-sink appears to have increased \nsince 2003, as estimated by both the atmospheric-based and \nthe ground-based approaches. The increase is mainly due to \nbetter representation of the processes. The forest sink has \ndecreased. The large CO2 losses from agriculture could not be \nconfirmed, but the large non-CO2 emissions from agriculture \nwere not recognised in the 2003 balance.\nThe forest sink results from an increase in biomass (70% of \nthe effect) and in the soil organic matter (30% of the effect).\nThis increment is closely coupled to the age-class distribution \nand to nitrogen deposition. One remarkable finding is that the \ncarbon-equivalent N2O emissions of agriculture are of similar \nmagnitude to the forest CO2 carbon sink.\nFuture estimates of the carbon balance may still change these \nvalues as additional data become available, but the estimates \nappear to be becoming increasingly reliable.\nKey questions:\nWhat is the contribution of non-CO2 greenhouse gases? A bet-\nter estimate is crucial. \nWould a continuous model of European land-use reduce the \nuncertainties? Such a land-use model is still missing.\nWhat is the role of land-use changes and the associated non-\nCO2 emissions? Knowledge of this contribution remains inad-\nequate.\n62\n9. International Perspective\nPep Canadell\nThe Global Carbon Project \ncoordinates international \nresearch, seeking to de-\nvelop a complete picture \nof the global carbon cycle, \nincluding both its biophysi-\ncal and human dimensions, \ntogether with the interac-\ntions and feedbacks be-\ntween them. \u2018CarboEurope-\nIP is one of the best examples of the new collaborative and \nmultidisciplinary research approach that is needed to study hu-\nman modification of planet Earth,\u2019 said Pep Canadell, Executive \nDirector of the Global Carbon Project.\n\u2018I wish we had one CarboEurope-IP-like project in each major \nregion of the world. If we did, we could put together the total \npicture of the global carbon balance and its interactions with \nclimate. We could then explore the full potential of managing \ncarbon sinks and sources across the globe for climate mitiga-\ntion, as now Europe is in a position to do.\u2019\nKevin Noone\nKevin Noone is Executive \nDirector of the Interna-\ntional Geosphere-Biosphere \nProgramme, whose agenda \nemphasises the importance \nof regarding the Earth as a \nsystem, where biological, \nphysical and human proc-\nesses interact. Kevin has \nbeen following CarboEu-\nrope-IP\u2018s progress and its impact on the international debate \non climate change. Kevin Noone said, \u2018The international com-\nmunity has set itself a very challenging goal: negotiating a new \nclimate agreement by the end of 2009. The success of these \nnegotiations requires having the best possible knowledge of \nhow carbon cycles between the atmosphere, land and marine \necosystems. CarboEurope-IP is an excellent example of how this \nbasic knowledge can be developed and made useful for decision \nsupport on adaptation and mitigation issues. CarboEurope-IP\u2019s \nwork to produce a carbon balance for Europe, link observations \nwith models, and detect the results of international agreements \nis a benchmark for other international efforts. It has raised the \nbar in terms of how basic research for decision support can be \ndone.\u2019\nDennis Baldocchi\nDennis Baldocchi is Pro-\nfessor of Biometeorology \nat the University of Cali-\nfornia, Berkeley, and co-\ninitiator of \u201cFluxnet\u201d, the \nworld-wide network of CO2 \nflux measuring groups. He \nis also a member of the \nCarboEurope-IP External \nAdvisory Panel. Dennis said \n\u2018CarboEurope-IP is viewed by scientists across the globe as the \npremier regional program tackling the multi-faceted problem \nof the carbon cycle.  The project uses a range of measurement \ntechniques (eddy covariance, remote sensing, inversion model-\nling) to produce a highly integrated assessment of net carbon \nexchange across a vast range of time and space scales. And this \ninformation is coupled with state of art models at the patch \nto regional scale that are used to interpret and project fluxes \ninto the future.  The Project has already had many heralded \nsuccesses: one example is analysis of the impact of some very \nimportant case studies, like the role of the 2003 European Heat \nWave and Drought, and major wind storms, on ecosystem struc-\nture and function.\u2019\nAndrew Mitchell\nThe Global Canopy Pro-\ngramme promotes forest \ncanopy research, education \nand  conservation with a \nspecial focus on the role of \nforests in climate change. \nIt is committed to explor-\ning the range and economic \nvalue of  forest ecosystem \nservices and to sharing the \nfindings with decision-makers in Government and finance.  Di-\nrector, Andrew Mitchell said \u2018CarboEurope-IP is showing us the \nvital role played by forests in removing carbon from the atmos-\nphere and storing it away - an ecosystem service which is of \nenormous economic benefit globally. The data that is coming \nout of CarboEurope-IP demonstrates the urgent need to manage \nEurope\u00b4s forests, and maximise their capacity to act as carbon \nsinks. Recognising this vital ecosystem service that forests pro-\nvide, most importantly in the tropics, in all the world\u2018s carbon \nmarkets, could provide a major economic incentive to protect \nforests and mitigate climate change efficiently.\u2019\n63\nRegional demonstration activities were established in CarboEu-\nrope-IP with the German Thuringian State Institute for Forestry, \nGame and Fishery (Gotha). The demonstration activities includ-\ned\n- the investigation of the wood product pool resulting from \ntimber harvested in Thuringia\u00b4s state forests and considera-\ntions of how the life-time in the product pool is influenced by \nforest management\n- considerations of how the forest cover and species composi-\ntion will change under different climate change scenarios. \n- the installation of a data base in combination with an em-\npirical, spatially explicit model which allows for a continuous \nrecord of carbon stocks in Thuringia\u00b4s state forests \n- organisation of joint workshops to transfer the knowledge on \nclimate change into the forest management community \n- to transfer recent research results on forestry \n- climate interactions to local and regional multipliers, schools, \nconsumers and decision makers by workshops, public presen-\ntations and an internet portal (Fig. IV.62) \nMost importantly for the forest management community was the \ninvestigation of the wood product pool resulting from tree har-\nvests in Thuringia\u00b4s state forests (Profft et al., EJFR, in press). \nThis study presents for the first time real carbon inputs of a \ndefined forest management unit to the wood-product sector by \nlinking data on raw timber production, timber sales and wood \nprocessing companies (Fig. IV.63). The partitioning of wood \ninto certain wood categories depends strongly on the stem di-\nameter. Short lived precuts dominate the small diameters, but \nlong-lived products saturate with modern wood-cutting tech-\nnologies at about 20 cm diameter, which is equivalent to about \n60 years of growth in spruce and beech. Interestingly, the price \nfor this product mix saturates at a diameter of 20 cm, which \nwould be an incentive to harvest wood at that dimension and \nage. About 47% of annual total timber harvest enters into short-\nlived wood products with a mean residence time (MRT) less than \n25 years. 31% of the total harvest enters into wood products \nwith a MRT of 25-43 years, and only 22% are used in the con-\nstruction industry, the product class with the longest MRT (50 \nyears). The average MRT of carbon in harvested wood products \nof Thuringia was 20 years, and thus, approaches that of dead \nwood in the forests (28 years). The MRT of wood products from \nThuringian forests were two times higher than estimates that \nwould result from a forest carbon model (CO2FIX, Nabuurs et al., \n2001), which can be ascribed to the relatively high production \nof large-dimensioned timber and its direct sale to international \nsaw-wood processing companies in Thuringia. \nThe MRT of wood products can be increased by management \nfrom 18 to 22 years by thinning from (harvesting suppressed \ntrees). However, the mean age and volume of forests is likely to \ndecrease in the future, because new wood technologies will al-\nlow for an effective production of relatively valuable and long-\nliving wood products from small, but homogenous timber types \nand the associated price structure.\nCarbon stocks in Thuringia\u00b4s forest ecosystems and their de-\nvelopment over the last 15 years are highly controlled by an \nunequal age distribution of forest stands and the dominance of \ninstable, overstocked pure coniferous forests resulting from his-\ntorical political frameworks. Thus, the suggested carbon man-\nagement strategy for Thuringia is the transfer of the even-aged, \nmono-species forests to uneven-aged, mixed forests producing \npredominantly large, valuable timber.\n10.

(Profft et al., accepted)\n64\n10.1 Demonstration Activities\nClimate change will impact the dis-\ntribution of main forest species and \nthe vitality and productivity of forest \necosystems in the temperature-pre-\ncipitation space of Thuringia. Mainly \naffected will be spruce (Picea abies) \n(Fig. IV.64), which might further \ndisappear from lower elevations and \nsuffer serious problems in the East \nof Thuringia (Fig. IV.65). Based on \ncurrent spruce distribution and soil \nconditions in Thuringia in combina-\ntion with regionalised climate data \nfor the period 1971 to 2000 classi-\nfied by macroclimatic units, distinct \nareas were identified with a high \npropor\u00action of spruce stands that are \nvulnerable to expected climate change \n(Fig. IV.64). These results were sup-\nported by monitoring data on damage \ncaused by bark beetle infestations \nduring the last two decades (Profft et \nal. 2008). \nTree species were recommended for \nregeneration in Thuringia according \nto these findings.\nThe transfer of knowledge has been \na major task for the demonstration \nproject. Additionally to direct edu-\ncation activities, the internet portal \n\u201cForest & Climate\u201d was developed in \n2004 and launched in 2005 under the \ninternet domain www.waldundklima.\nnet. The portal covers the whole is-\nsue of climate change and forestry \nincluding carbon aspects. It should \nserve as an open platform for other \ninstitutions, associations and groups \nworking in the field of forestry, eco-\nsystem research, timber use and cli-\nmate change, where they can present \ntheir work and results in a popular \nscientific manner.

Spruce will be most badly affected \nand might disappear from lower elevations. \nKey questions\nWhat are the effects of an increasing demand for energy wood, \nthe development of the second regeneration of biofuels, and \nongoing changes in wood technology on the greenhouse gas \nbudget of forest ecosystems and the carbon balance of the \nwood product sector including substitution effects? \nWhat are the effects of weather extremes on the annual and \ndecennial carbon budget of managed forest ecosystems and \nthe entire forestry sector?\nHow can changes of weather extremes be included in regional \nrisk assessments? \nCan markets and consumer decisions be regulated or opti-\nmised to converge towards a carbon neutral society?\n% of area under risk\n\u2264 10%\n> 10% and \u2264 25%\n> 25% and \u2264 50%\n> 50% and \u2264 75%\n> 75%\nspruce not present\nFig. IV.65: Present spruce stands in \nThuringia at potential risk rom cli-\nmate change.

Schools have the \nresponsibility of equipping the young with the under-\nstanding they need to participate in this debate in an \ninformed way and giving them the knowledge to make \nchoices about how we should be managing the environ-\nment to build a sustainable future.\nRecognising this responsibility, CarboEurope-IP has \njoined with its sister project CarboOcean-IP in an ini-\ntiative to raise young people\u2019s awareness of the global \ncarbon balance and the research that is going on to find \nthe sources and sinks of carbon on land and sea. This \ninitiative, CarboSchools, is engaging with schoolteach-\ners and pupils by connecting them to scientists and \nmaking them aware of the whole process of research. \nNot just teaching what we know, but equally making \nyoung people aware of what we don\u2019t know: the limita-\ntions of our knowledge and the way we go about build-\ning new knowledge. The emphasis is on project-based \nteaching, learning by doing, encouraging hands-on ex-\nperience in up-to-date research. This approach helps to \nbring pupils first-hand knowledge and enhances their \nunderstanding of the problems being addressed (Fig. \nIV.66a-e).\nAlthough the main role of CarboSchools is to act as a \ncatalyst involving CarboEurope-IP scientists in school \nprojects, recognising that the number of scientists \nis limited, CarboSchools is also using the internet \nto provide materials to all teachers and pupils. Marc \nJamous of the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et \nde l\u2018Environnement, Gif-sur-Yvette gives an example \n\u2018we have set up an internet site on the carbon cycle \nand its impacts on global change. There is a \u201cvisitors\u2019 \nspace\u201d for the general public and school children, \u201ca \nteachers\u2019 space\u201d, to provide materials for teachers and \na \u201cresearchers\u2019 space\u201d to help the scientists to be bet-\nter prepared in communicating their work to schools.\u2019\nPhilippe Saugier, coordinator of CarboSchools, says \u2018the \nchanges that are happening to our planet challenge \nour way of thinking and making decisions. The Earth system \nis a complex web of interacting, interdependent forces, which \ndemands new thinking, not just from scientists but decision-\nmakers at all levels. Young people are always receptive to new \nideas and they will be the pacemakers in the race to deliver \nthe solutions to the problems of global change. Solutions must \nbe built on an appreciation of the complexity and interdisci-\nplinary nature of the problem and the links between decisions \nat all levels, from international treaties to everyday individual \nchoices.\u2019 In the future, CarboSchools will also have to teach the \ninteraction between the Carbon Cycle and land management, \nwhich supports our daily life.\nAs part of the EU Science in Society programme, a new phase to \nCarboSchools has been funded for the period 2008-2010. This \nsecond phase will extend the programme with a target of more \nthan 100 schools being directly partnered with research institu-\ntions across Europe.\n10.2 Training and Outreach\nFig IV.66a: Pupils from Lyc\u00e9e Max Linder (Libourne, France) discover CarboEurope-IP \nresearch with INRA scientists in the Cestas forest, near Bordeaux.

Michel)\nSchools\u2019 experiment: SchoolCO2web\nOne of the objectives in the new phase of CarboSchools beginning in 2008 is to create a pan-European schools\u2019 experiment \nknown as \u201cSchoolCO2web\u201d. The experiment builds on a pilot project in the Netherlands, being run by the University of Gro-\nningen. In that experiment, pupils from secondary schools get hands-on experience with real CO2 measuring instruments \ninstalled at their schools. The data are brought together on a website where they can be seen and shared.\nThe great asset of this experience is that it provides pupils with an opportunity to really \u201csee\u201d the invisible CO2 gas, to per-\nform real measurements of their own, to compare data from different locations and to discuss their results and share their \nimpressions with each other. \nThe Groningen model will be extended in the Netherlands, and to the European level, by involving another 10 to 20 schools in \nother countries. Research groups experienced in performing CO2 measurements will collaborate with near-by schools, acting \nas the \u201clocal support lab\u201c. Adding schools to the network is then straightforward: instruments will be installed at the schools, \ntheir maintenance explained, teachers trained and the schools registered in the web-database.\n68\nCarboEurope-IP Young Scientist Award\nCarboEurope-IP takes a long term view and training early career \nscientists is thus a priority; they will have the responsibility \nof moving the work forward in the future. Young scientists are \nencouraged to attend spring and summer schools, and special \nworkshops. These have covered training in methods and inte-\ngration, on method intercomparison, and modelling. They are \nheld in cooperation with other European scientific and training \nprogrammes \nEvery year two young scientists (PhD students and young \nPostdocs as first author) are awarded with the CarboEurope-IP \nyoung scientist award for outstanding publications. The criteria \nfor this award is that the research decribed must be applicable \nacross multiple parts of carbon cycle science, be innovative and \ngive new insight.

This requires a thor-\nough understanding of ecosystem carbon response to distur-\nbance, human management and climate change, and the feed-\nbacks involved.\nCarboEurope-IP has identified the following research priorities \nto implement this strategy and address the following key issues \nand questions.\n1. Attribution of regional changes in the carbon budget from \n1990 to 2012 to human and natural drivers\nEcosystem, atmospheric and ancillary observations and models \nshould be used to quantify the annual to decadal changes in \nthe carbon and greenhouse gas budget of Europe, from 1990 to \n2012. This initiative should be driven by data on climate and \natmospheric composition, fossil fuel emissions, and land use. \nObservations should be expanded to under-sampled regions and \nto cover CO2, CH4, N2O, and lateral carbon fluxes from local to \ncontinental scale. The research should emphasise the European \ncontinent as a whole and focus on critical European regions \nwith rapid socio-economic and\/or climate-driven changes. Data \nassimilation systems and advanced biosphere and earth system \nmodels need to be further developed to include more realism \nin land use and management. Methods need to be improved \nto quantify and verify patterns and changes in anthropogenic \ngreenhouse gas emissions. \nThe key questions are:\nHow has the European carbon balance evolved over the \nlast decades, and how is it changing at the moment? \nTo what extent, and for how long can Europe rely on the \nterrestrial carbon sink?\nHave the promised emission reductions in Europe really \ntaken place, have the climate policies been effective?\n2. Maintaining, improving and integrating in situ observa-\ntions on land, atmosphere and ocean\nA robust, quality-controlled, long-term system of in-situ obser-\nvations is needed to improve the knowledge basis for making \nand monitoring emission-reduction goals, to maintain Europe\u2019s \ninternational credibility and to maintain ownership over its car-\nbon balance estimates.\nThe existing network of continuous, in situ observations needs \nto be sustained for the coming 4-5 years before it can be moved \nfrom research into more operational mode under the proposed \nICOS infrastructure (see Page 51). We must explore whether \nuniting the existing networks of atmosphere, land and ocean \nobservations of carbon and greenhouse gases would improve \nthe provision of data needed during the first Kyoto commit-\nment period (for example through verification, or expansion to \nunder-sampled regions). Methodological improvement needs to \nbe made to bridge the gap between the existing observational \nscales and to improve the link between in situ and satellite \nbased observations. We should explore the viability of linking \nwith other already established networks, such as those for mon-\nitoring nitrogen and air pollution.\nThe key question is:\nWhat are the trends and decadal ecosystem response to \nclimate stress and changes in land management?\n3. The terrestrial carbon cycle in other regions of the globe, \nespecially Africa\nThe CarboAfrica pilot study should be continued and intensified. \nThere are huge expectations from African researchers and we \nhave a moral obligation to continue this research and the scien-\ntific capacity building which it initiated. Compared to the other \ncontinents, there has been very little research into the carbon \nbalance of Africa, making it a high priority research area. Dis-\nturbance on the African continent explains a large part of the \nglobal interannual variability of the net land carbon uptake. \nThis flux needs to be further constrained. The expected call for \na project on the impact of deforestation is seen as very useful. \nHowever, the challenge for Africa is not simply land use change, \nbut land degradation and the consequent impacts on plant and \nsoil processes. Soil degradation is globally the most important \nterrestrial carbon source, but has so far been largely neglected. \nThis challenge requires more research.\nThe key questions are:\nWhat is the role of other land masses in the global \ncarbon balance?\nWhat are the processes controlling the soil carbon \nbalance in other climates?\nWhat is the impact of land and soil degradation on \ncontinental carbon budgets?\n11. Strategy and Future Priorities\n70\n4. Focused research to understand coupling between the \ncarbon and water cycles and the carbon and nutrient cycles\nOur capacity to predict the terrestrial carbon cycle is limited by \nthe unknown coupling and feedbacks between the major global \ncycles. Small to medium research projects are need to quantify \nand understand the coupling between the carbon and water \ncycle and the carbon and other nutrient cycles, in particular \nthe water and nitrogen cycle. Using experiments, observations \nand models, research should elucidate the fundamental cou-\npling mechanisms from the process level to the scale of regional \ncarbon-climate feedbacks. Vulnerable or hotspot regions require \nspecial attention.\nThe key question is:\nWhat are the interactions and feedbacks between the \nmajor global cycles, especially of water and nitrogen?\n5. Managing adaptation and mitigation.\nResearch should quantify climate change impacts, and adap-\ntation and mitigation options at the local to regional level. \nObservations, economic, biophysical and climate models need \nto be linked to develop region-specific solutions, especially in \nview of a global food shortage.\nThe key questions are:\nWhat action should we take at the regional level in \nresponse to climate change?\nHow can we solve the global food shortage?\n6. Land \u2013 atmosphere \u2013 ocean integration\nSynthesis between land and ocean is being addressed by the \nCOCOS Concerted Action \u2013 bringing observations together. At \npresent, land and ocean science have very different uncertain-\nties and research needs, so the core land and ocean research \nshould continue to move in parallel. However collaboration \nshould be encouraged in areas of overlap, such as the research \nneeded to quantify the carbon exchange at the interface be-\ntween land and ocean. Improvement of coupled land \u2013 ocean \n\u2013 atmosphere models and atmospheric inversions could also be \nincluded within the Climate Part of the Environment Theme. \nCollaboration between the land and ocean communities should \nalso be encouraged where there is potential to produce syn-\nergy, such as in technological development of sensors, and data \ntransfer and management. \nThe key questions are:\nWhat are the carbon fluxes at the land-ocean interface?\nHow does the total Earth system behave now and in the \nfuture?\nHow can ocean-atmosphere-land observation be improved \nby new common technologies?\n7. Integration and synthesis of the terrestrial carbon cycle\nPast and ongoing research projects at national and European \nlevel have produced a wealth of data and knowledge to be syn-\nthesised and analysed in synergy with parallel research pro-\ngrammes in other world regions. In FP6, CarboEurope-IP has \nsuccessfully operated as a platform to integrate research and \nto stimulate synthesis activities beyond the formal project \nboundaries. The anticipated smaller partnerships and sizes of \nEuropean projects under FP7, creates the danger that the criti-\ncal mass and dynamics will be lost. This creates the need for \na co-ordination project for terrestrial carbon that will act as a \nplatform for the interchange of new ideas, and will maintain the \nintegration of the research community and continue to produce \nnew synthesis. This platform should also link to programmes \nin other world regions. To keep up the momentum and pre-\nvent fragmentation of the research teams, a co-ordination ac-\ntion should start very soon after the end of CarboEurope-IP. A \nproject starting in 2009 would be best.\n11. Strategy and Future Priorities\nSummary of research priorities\n1.  Attribution of regional changes in the carbon budget \nfrom 1990 to 2012 to human and natural drivers. \n2.  Maintaining, improving and integrating in situ observa-\ntions on land, atmosphere and ocean. \n3.  Researching the carbon balance and the role of land \ndegradation on the global carbon cycle on other con-\ntinents.\n4.  Focused research to understand coupling between the \ncarbon and water cycles, and the carbon and nutrient \ncycles.\n5.  Developing regional options for adaptation and miti-\ngation.\n6.  Collaborative research on land-ocean interactions and \ntechnological development.\n7.  Synthesising the results of the many past and ongoing \nterrestrial projects (e.g., through a Concerted Action).\n71\n11. Strategy and Future Priorities\nCross-cutting future research themes\nThe priority issues call for a number of common research \nthemes which will need to be expanded as generic areas of \ndevelopment.\nSoil carbon:\nIn the long term soil is the most important terrestrial carbon \nstore and we need to learn more about processes, soil reac-\ntions and how to model the soil carbon balance. We must \nalso research changes in soil carbon stocks. There are ques-\ntions which need to be resolved about the carbon balances \nof cropland and pasture soils, and unmanaged, climax forest. \nWe have laid the foundations, but soil changes are slow and \nrelatively small against a large variable background. Soil re-\nsearch requires a long term approach.\nInverse modelling:\nThe techniques of inverse modelling are being developed \nwith the objective of making them operational, but equally \ninverse modelling is a powerful technique which increasingly \nwill be used to give insight into the functioning of ecosys-\ntems at a range of scales and under a variety of stresses.\nRegional scale modelling:\nThe complex spatio-temporal patterns in land use and atmos-\npheric mixing at the regional scale, call for improved model-\nling capacity. The region scale is increasingly becoming the \nfocus both of carbon accounting and our efforts to respond \nto climate change. Monitoring of carbon sources and sinks, \nassessing the impacts of extreme events, and land use and \nland management change all require development of more \ncomprehensive and integrated meso-scale models.\nThe multiple constraint approach: \nCarboEurope-IP has successfully pioneered the integrative \nmultiple constraint approach. We need to continue develop-\ning this research philosophy, moving beyond observations to \ncombining data with detailed process-studies, manipulations \nand research in regions undergoing massive change.\nData access and assimilation:\nCarboEurope-IP has been successful in bringing together \nobservational scientists with modellers. The free movement \nof data has played a significant role in this and it is impor-\ntant to maintain this movement through well-organised and \neasily accessible databases. New initiatives such as inverse \nmodelling will require full integration of all available data \nstreams into the models and data assimilation is the key to \nimproving model estimates. Data management and data as-\nsimilation are increasingly ubiquitous and important areas \nwhich need their own specific funding.\n72\n12. CarboEurope-IP History\nCarbon Cycle research emerged from research into acid rain. In \nthe 1980s forest decline was a major concern across Europe. A \nlarge, coordinated research effort identified acid deposition and \nSO2 as causes. The European conference 1983 at Karlsruhe on \n\u201cAcid deposition, a challenge for Europe\u201d initiated Concerted \nActions (COST 611 and COST 612) to identify further actions.\nIn 1987 the Symposium at Genoble on \u201cAir Pollution and Eco-\nsystems\u201d (P. Mathy, ed.) further substantiated the acid rain \neffects and extended the focus towards climate and nitrogen \ninteractions. In the 1st and 2nd Framework Program (FP) the pro-\njects CLIMEX (Climate experiments), CORE (reciprocal exchange \nof soil cores), ENCORE (European catchment studies), EPOCH \n(Atmospheric constituents), EXMAN (experimental ecosystem \nmanipulations), NITREX (nitrogen saturation experiments), and \nFERN (Forest Ecosystem Research Network) were initiated. In \n1990 the Edinburgh workshop on Acid Deposition (Last and \nWatling, eds) gave an ultimate summary of the acid rain re-\nsearch epoch.\nWith the 1991 Florence Symposium on \u201cResponses of forest \necosystems to Environmental change\u201d (Teller, Mathy, Jeffers, \neds.) climate change became increasingly important. In the 3rd \n(1993-1995) and 4th (1997 \u2013 1999) FP projects started (1) with \nEcosystem focus: NIPHYS (nitrogen physiology of ecosystems), \nCANIF (Carbon-nitrogen interactions), (2) with Canopy focus: \nFLUXNET, EUROFLUXNET and MEDIFLUX, (3) with atmospheric \nfocus: ESCOBA and ESCOBA II studying carbon in the ocean, the \nbiosphere and the atmosphere, and (4) studies were extended \nbeyond Europe (EUROSIBERIAN CARBON FLUX). \n   \nDuring this period the Kyoto Protocol (1993) was negotiated \nwhich foresees an accounting of biological sinks in balance of \nfossil fuel emissions. Also, the need for a stronger focus on \u201ccli-\nmate change\u201d was underlined by the 1996 IPCC report, which \nstated that \u201cthe balance of evidence suggests a discernible hu-\nman influence on global climate\u201d.\n \nIn 1998 an expert meeting in Brussels discussed the \u201cGreen-\nhouse gas sink approach of the Kyoto Protocol\u201d. This meeting \nwas the final turning point were the emphasis shifted from ni-\ntrogen and air pollution towards greenhouse gases and carbon \ncycle, and it was the Orvieto workshop of the ESCOBA II project \nin which (24 June 1998) an interdisciplinary project \u201cCARBON-\nEUROPE\u201d was proposed, in order to combine atmospheric, eco-\nsystem and soils based research. Already in 2000 at COP6 (The \nHague) the CarboEurope cluster forwarded the proposal for \u201cFull \nCarbon Accounting\u201d. The political reply was, that this vision \ncame too early. Nevertheless, the EU summarized its research \nat the 2000 Lisbon workshop on \u201cTerrestrial carbon research \nand observations\u201d as part of the IGBP \u201cGlobal Carbon Plan\u201d. \nThis research was in concert with the international efforts to \nclarify the global biogeochemical cycles in the IGBP-projects \nGCTE, BAHC and IGAC. The 2001 Stockholm meeting on \u201cthe \ncarbon sink: Absorption capacity of the European Biosphere\u201d \nwas an additional cornerstone in this process.\nThe 5th Framework Programme of the EU significantly increased \nthe efforts on carbon cycle research. About 22 projects were \nestablished (1) in Ecosystems (e.g.: CAMELS - Carbon assimila-\ntion and modeling; CARBO-AGE \u2013 Age-related forest dynamics; \nCARBOINVENT \u2013 Forest inventories; CARBOMONT \u2013 Carbon fluxes \nin Mountains; FORCAST \u2013 Forest carbon-nitrogen trajectories; \nGREENGRAS \u2013 Greenhouse gases from managed grasslands), (2) of \ncanopy fluxes (e.g. CARBOEUROFLUX, CARBODATA), (3) of atmos- \npheric processes (AEROCARB \u2013 airborne regional observation; \nCHIOTTO \u2013 Continuous high-precision tall tower observations; \nRECAB \u2013 Regional assessments of the European carbon balance; \nTACOS-INFRASTRUCTURE \u2013 Terrestrial and atmospheric carbon \nobservation system; CarboEurope-GHG \u2013 Synthesis of European \ngreenhouse gas budgets) and (4) of global observations \noutside Europe (e.g. TCOS-Siberia, LBA-CARBONSINK, SIBERIA \nII). Most of the carbon-related projects were at that time com-\nbined under the \u201cumbrella\u201d of the CarboEurope-Cluster. The 2002 \nCarboEurope Press event at Valencia summarized this research.\nThe 2001 IPCC summary emphasised the need for further carbon \ncycle research \u201cEmissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols due \nto human activities continue to alter the atmosphere in ways \nthat are expected to affect the climate\u201d. Thus, in the 6th Fra-\nmework Programme large integrated projects were introduced. \nThus CarboEurope-IP was established in 2003. This research \neffort was further supported by integrated projects outside Eu-\nrope, mainly CarboAfrica-IP, CarboNorth-IP and the PAN-Ama-\nzonia project. In addition, the need to further understand the \ninteractions of the carbon and nitrogen cycles was emphasised \nby the establishment of NitroEurope-IP.\nKnowledge from CarboEurope research had also entered the IPCC \nprocess, which summarized in the Forth Assessment Report that \n\u201cthe understanding of anthropogenic warming and cooling in-\nfluences on climate has improved since the TAR, leading to very \nhigh confidence that the global average net effect of human ac-\ntivities since 1750 has been one of warming\u201d. This evidence in-\ncludes the necessity for future carbon cycle research to further \nreduce the uncertainties and to give evidence of the effects of \ncarbon policies during the Kyoto commitment period until 2013, \nand to give scientific guidance to the post Kyoto process.\nCarbon Cycle Research in the EU has been administered over \nthe past 25 years through the major efforts of the scientific \nofficers of the European Commission: Giovanni Angeletti, Claus \nBr\u00fcning, Panagiotis Balabanis, Mario Catizzone, Anver Ghazi, \nAnastasios Kentarchos, and Pierre Mathy. The success of Carbo-\nEurope owes much to the skill and commitment of this team of \nthe scientific officers.\n73\nBooks:\nDolman H, Valentini R, Freibauer A (Editors), 2008. \nThe Continental-Scale Greenhouse Gas Balance of Europe.

CarboOcean-IP - Background\n1.1 The Ocean as a CO2 buffer system\n1.1 The Ocean as a CO2 buffer system\nThe ocean is a huge and relatively quickly-overturning reservoir \nfor carbon (mixing times for surface waters are less than a year; \nintermediate waters to 800 m depth, years to decades; deep wa-\nters, decades to several centuries). The total overturning time \nfor the ocean is approximately 1500 years. Most carbon in the \nocean water column is stored as inorganically dissolved car-\nbon (DIC), while only smaller amounts are stored as dissolved \norganic carbon (DOC) or particulate organic carbon (POC) (the \napproximate weight ratio is DIC:DOC:POC = 100:2.5:0.1, Degens \net al., 1984). Freshwater can usually only hold small amounts \nof inorganically bound carbon. However, because seawater is \nslightly alkaline, with pH values around 8.3-7.5, it easily dis-\nsociates weak acids such as carbonic acid. \nGaseous CO2 is exchanged between the surface ocean and the \natmosphere according to Henry\u2019s law. Higher CO2 partial pres-\nsure in the atmosphere than in the ocean will induce a CO2 flux \ninto the ocean and vice versa. The solubility of CO2 and the \nequilibrium concentration of CO2 in surface waters are largely \ndetermined by the seawater temperature. When gaseous CO2 \nenters the ocean, it is partially hydrated to create carbonic \nacid and dissociated into bicarbonate HCO3\n- and bicarbonate \nCO3\n2-. The three inorganic carbon species in the ocean occur \napproximately in the following ratio (CO2+H2CO3):HCO3\n-:CO3\n2- = \n1:100:10. The sum of CO2 and H2CO3 is called \u201cfree CO2\u201d and \nconsists mainly of CO2. The concentration of total dissolved in-\norganic carbon is determined by the sum of carbon included in \n(CO2+H2CO3) +HCO3\n- + CO3\n2-. During the dissociation, the car-\nbonic acid splits off a proton, H+, and thus decreases the pH \nvalue. The following reactions occur after an addition of CO2 to \nthe water (for details on inorganic sea water carbon chemistry, \nplease see Zeebe and Wolf-Gladrow, 2001):\n(1)  Direct reaction with water: \nCO2\ngas + H2O \u2194 {or: H2CO3} \u2194 H\n+ + HCO3\n-\n \n(2)  Partial neutralisation through carbonate: \nCO2\ngas + H2O + CO3\n2- \u2194 {or: H2CO3 + CO3\n2-} \u2194 2HCO3\n- \u2194  \nH+ + HCO3\n- + CO3\n2-\n \nThe net effect of the CO2 dissociation is that the seawater be-\ncomes less alkaline when CO2 is added (\u201cocean acidification\u201d). \nFrom the first of the equations, it can be seen that carbonate \nions (CO3\n2-) are required to convert free CO2 into bicarbonate \nHCO3\n-. These carbonate ions can be delivered through dissolu-\ntion of calcium carbonate shell material (CaCO3) which has ac-\ncumulated on the ocean floor. This process is of little help in \nneutralising fossil fuel CO2 in the ocean because the ocean has \nto be mixed through repeatedly, making the timescale very long \n(several 10,000 years) (Archer, 2005). Because the inorganic \nseawater carbon chemistry is non-linear, the ability of seawater \n1. Background\nThe atmospheric CO2 concentration has been rising from a pre-\nindustrial level of 280 parts per million (ppm) to over 390 ppm \ntoday. However, the atmospheric CO2 content would be even \nhigher if it were not for the fact that at present around 55% \nof the anthropogenic CO2 emissions have been taken up by the \nland and the oceans. The ocean in particular has the most im-\nportant potential as a long-term sink for anthropogenic CO2. \nLatest results from the CarboOcean-IP project record the North \nAtlantic and the Southern Ocean showing a decrease in uptake \nstrength for anthropogenic CO2 compared to what was expected. \nAir-sea fluxes of CO2 show high temporal (seasonal, interan-\nnual) and spatial variation as a result of variability in climate, \nbiological activity and ocean circulation. Temporal and spatial \ndetails of the ocean sinks need to be more accurately quanti-\nfied and marine physical, chemical, and biological feedbacks to \nclimate change and rising CO2 have to become more accurately \ndetermined. The European CarboOcean-IP project has built up \nworldwide links to approach these issues through a combination \nof field observations, process studies, and modelling in order to \nidentify and predict changes in the oceanic sink for CO2. \nMarine carbon cycle research is of immediate relevance to in-\nforming decisions on energy production and consumption (e.g. \n\u201chow quickly does the ocean buffer CO2 from the atmosphere?\u201d). \nThe variability in the ocean carbon sink needs to be quanti-\nfied and the growing number of highly controversial mitigation \ntechnological options for greenhouse gas geo-engineering, such \nas artificial ocean fertilisation, need to be critically evaluated. \n81\n1.2  Ultimate CO2 capacity of the ocean versus uptake \nkinetics\nto dissociate and hold additional CO2 decreases with rising CO2 \npartial pressure. Moreover, the oceanic buffer factor (e.g. Bolin \nand Eriksson, 1959, Zeebe and Wolf-Gladrow, 2001) varies with \ntemperature and alkalinity. Warm waters in general have a bet-\nter buffering ability than cold waters due to improved dissocia-\ntion of carbonic acid with temperature. On the other hand, the \nsolubility of CO2 in seawater decreases with temperature. \nThe net effect of marine biological activity is to keep the surface \nocean CO2 partial pressure up to about 300 ppm lower (Maier-\nReimer et al., 1996) than it would be for a lifeless ocean. Also \nthe general three-dimensional distribution of dissolved inor-\nganic carbon in the oceans is caused by biological processes \n(production of organic carbon at the sea surface, degradation in \ndeeper layers). Natural variations in the carbon cycle and the at-\nmospheric CO2 concentration \u2013 especially on glacial-interglacial \ntime scales \u2013 may be largely caused by changes in marine nutri-\nent cycling and changes in biological processes. The oceanic \nuptake of anthropogenic carbon is dominated by the physical-\nchemical absorption of carbon. However, biological processes \nsignificantly modulate this uptake through climatically induced \nchanges to ecosystems. The impact of ocean acidification on \nmarine biota is an active field of research. However, the globally \nintegrated effect on air-sea CO2 fluxes is likely to be relatively \nsmall when compared to the effect of anticipated anthropogen-\nic CO2 emissions (Heinze, 2004, Ridgewell et al., 2007; Gehlen \net al., 2007). The bottleneck for marine uptake of CO2 is the \ndownward mixing of water which is saturated with respect to \nhuman-made excess CO2 (Bolin and Eriksson, 1959).\n1.2 Ultimate CO2 capacity of the ocean versus uptake kinet-\nics\nGiven \u201clong enough time\u201d, i.e. several 10,000 years, the ocean \nhas the ability to absorb the major part of all the CO2 previously \nadded to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuel (Bolin and Eriks-\nson, 1959; Archer, 2005). But reaching this new equilibrium \nbetween the CO2 in the atmosphere and the oceans would occur \nlong after the human-induced CO2 perturbation of the Earth sys-\ntem. This large \u201cultimate CO2 uptake capacity\u201d is due to the \ninorganic CO2 buffering in the ocean water column and the dis-\nsolution of calcium carbonate (or CaCO3) sediments from the sea \nfloor. The limit of CO2 absorption will be reached when no fur-\nther CaCO3 can be re-dissolved from the sea floor. This will occur \nwhen all CaCO3 that can be mobilised has left the top sediment \nlayer which would then seal off the further potentially reactive \nlayers below a quasi-inert \u201clid\u201d of clay material (Broecker and \nTakahashi, 1977). This ultimate uptake capacity indicates that \neven after several 10,000 years the atmospheric CO2 level will \nstill be higher than the original pre-industrial level if no other \nmechanisms (such as weathering of silico-carbonates on land) \ndo not very slowly reduce the remaining CO2 anomaly. Further, \nthe anthropogenic CO2 invasion would have completely dis-\nsolved the marine CaCO3 sediment, with unknown consequences \non ocean ecology and biogeochemical cycling. These long-term \neffects (including the radiative effect influencing potential fu-\nture glacial-interglacial cycles, Cochelin et al., 2006) must also \nbe taken into account when considering the overall impact of \nanthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.\nTaken as a whole, ocean processes are expected to produce a \nnegative feedback on the elevated CO2 levels from human-made \nCO2 emissions, i.e. they will reduce these levels and act as a \nbrake on climate change. However, how the strength of this \nnegative feedback changes with time, and the consequent lev-\nel of human-made CO2 in the atmosphere, will depend on the \nchemical state of the ocean surface layer and the progress of \noceanic mixing. It is of crucial importance to correctly quantify \nthe marine \u201cCO2 uptake kinetics\u201d, that is to accurately predict \nhow long it will take for the ocean to reach equilibrium with the \natmosphere and to understand the relevant processes. Ocean \nmodel scenarios have shown, that the build up of anthropogenic \nCO2 in the atmosphere depends on a combination of the amount \nand timing of the emissions (Maier-Reimer and Hasselmann, \n1987), the rate of oceanic overturning, its temperature, and \nfurther biogeochemical feedbacks (Friedlingstein et al., 2006). \nSo far, projections of the climate until the end of the 21st Centu-\nry show a parallel increase in seawater temperature, increasing \nCO2 partial pressure, and a slowing down of ocean circulation. \nThe net effect is a slowing down in uptake rates per additional \nemission made. This is expected to occur as an addition to the \nexisting bottleneck effect with the present ocean circulation. \nFor the timeframe of the next fe w human generations, it is thus \nthe timing of the marine uptake of anthropogenic CO2 which is \nthe decisive issue.\n82\n1.3 Ocean challenges\n1.3 Ocean challenges\nThe challenge for oceanographers is to determine the inventory \nof anthropogenic carbon in the ocean as well as the regional \nand global air-sea net CO2 fluxes, to understand the control \nmechanisms of the carbon cycle, and to make predictions about \npotential future developments on carbon re-distributions in the \nEarth system. What makes it such an extensive task to quantify \naccurately the oceanic carbon fluxes and budgets?\nCompared to the atmosphere, oceanic motion is operating on \nlong time scales and short spatial scales, the counterpart of \natmospheric cyclones, the oceanic mesoscale eddies have only \nlength scales of 2-100 km (as compared to 1000 km in the \natmosphere) but can persist over several months (rather than \nthe 1-2 weeks found in the atmosphere). In addition, the ocean \nis difficult to access. Either expensive research cruises are \nneeded, or costly automated measurement equipment has to \nbe deployed and recovered. As a result, the oceans are a highly \nundersampled Earth system reservoir. Only very few stations ex-\nist with long time series of data. Hence, the statistics of carbon \ntransport within the ocean with respect to space and time are \nlargely unknown. However, we do have remarkable new findings \nwhich give us a fairly good picture of the possible range of \nfluctuations in marine carbon fluxes over various time scales. \nThese findings tell us that our picture of air-sea carbon fluxes \nis still very crude. \nAnother difficulty is the fact, that the anthropogenic carbon \ninvasion into the ocean started long before the instrumental \nrecord of reliable high accuracy, direct measurements of total \ninorganic carbon and alkalinity began in the early 1990s (one \nalways needs measurements of two carbon state variables in the \nocean to fully constrain the various inorganic carbon species and \nthe pH value). Therefore, we have no exact baseline with which \nto compare modern carbon measurements. The large carbon-up-\ntake capacity of seawater makes it difficult to identify the an-\nthropogenic perturbation of the marine carbon cycle above the \nnatural background carbon concentration. Nevertheless, several \ndifferent methods have been developed to indirectly determine \nthe inventory of anthropogenic carbon in today\u2019s ocean that \nhas built up since the beginning of the industrial revolution. \nThese methods still give differing results in detecting anthropo-\ngenic carbon in some critical regions of the world ocean. Model \nresults show that the structure of the anthropogenic carbon in \nthe ocean deviates considerably from the natural structure (i.e. \nthe natural surface ocean has low carbon concentrations due to \nbiological activity, while the anthropogenic carbon concentra-\ntions at the ocean surface are highest).\nTo establish detailed marine carbon fluxes at the transition \nfrom continents to the open ocean - from rivers and estuaries \nthrough the shelf seas - one has to take the complex boundary \nconditions and large variability in ecosystem structure into ac-\ncount. Riverine and aeolian inputs of carbon and nutrients must \nalso be included. At certain locations, carbon fluxes per unit \narea can be very high, but there is large spatial and temporal \nvariability in the underlying processes which control the carbon \nbudget. As yet, these difficulties make it impossible to include \nthe global coastlines and shelf seas in a sufficiently realistic \nway within global carbon cycle models.\nFinally, there are considerable gaps in our knowledge of nat-\nural marine carbon cycle climate feedbacks and the relevant \nbiogeochemical processes. The largest natural atmospheric CO2 \nvariations, which are very well documented through ice core \nmeasurements \u2013 namely the glacial-interglacial changes in at-\nmospheric CO2 concentration \u2013 are not yet fully understood and \nthe combination of processes causing them is as yet not known. \nFurther, we do not as yet understand how marine particle fluxes \nand ecosystems will react in a warm and high-CO2 world. In ad-\ndition, we do not yet know the precise way in which the ocean \ncirculation will develop in the coming decades and centuries, \nnor how any changes will influence the buffering of anthropo-\ngenic carbon. The lack of observational evidence and lack of \nprocess understanding leads to many processes which control \nthe cycling of carbon in current Earth system models being only \ncrudely parameterised. In many cases, semi-empirical formula-\ntions are used in our marine carbon cycle models. Although \nthey draw a picture that resembles the current state of the real \nocean, they may not be able to reproduce changes in the sys-\ntem, when the models are forced with perturbations, such as \nthe human-induced CO2 emissions together with other global \nclimate and environmental changes.\nThe Ocean\n\u2022 covers 71% of the Earth\u2019s surface but is a highly undersam-\npled area compared to the land: It needs continuous and \nsystematic exploration, especially with respect to ocean \ncarbon monitoring!\n\u2022 reduces significantly the amount of human-produced CO2 in \nthe atmosphere due to the large uptake capacity of sea-\nwater.\n\u2022  a number of various but not yet fully understood processes \nin the ocean control the natural carbon cycle variations, \ne.g. glacial\/interglacial changes.\n\u2022 in addition to the natural amount of CO2 in seawater, \naround 50% of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions have been \ntaken up by the oceans: this leads to ocean acidification \nand the consequent threats to the marine ecosystem need \nto be established through high quality measurements.\n83\n2. Synthesis of results from CarboOcean-IP so far\n2.1 Project and consortium goals\nThe marine part of this report has a considerable focus on topics \nand results associated with the CarboOcean-IP-project \u201cMarine \ncarbon sources and sinks assessment\u201d which is the European \ncontribution to the global observation and modelling network \non marine carbon. CarboOcean-IP is an FP6 Integrated Project \nfunded over a five year period (2005-2009) with 14.5 million \u20ac. \nIt combines the key European experts of 35 contracting partners \nfrom 14 countries, including the USA. However, the work of Car-\nboOcean-IP is also intimately liked with marine carbon research \nactivities in other projects. Here, we present CarboOcean-IP as \na case study of a successfully working carbon cycle research \nproject, but, of course, not as the only research activity in this \nfield, in Europe or internationally. Explicitly, we would like to \nmention the US carbon cycle research programme including no-\ntably the Ocean Carbon and Biogeochemistry (OCB, http:\/\/www.\nus-ocb.org\/) programme, with which CarboOcean-IP has links.\n2    Synthesis of results from CarboOcean-IP so far\n2.1 Project and consortium goals: a concerted effort to re-\nduce uncertainties\nCarboOcean-IP is the key FP6 Integrated Project on marine car-\nbon sources and sinks. The project emerged from a suite of pre-\nvious research projects in earlier framework programmes with \nthe objective of integrating European marine carbon cycle re-\nsearch through a strong, well-organised and coordinated effort. \nThe scientific objective was to provide more reliable numbers \non large-scale air-sea CO2 fluxes. In doing this CarboOcean-IP \nwas able to build on previous research projects, such as the \ninternationally well-recognised FP5 studies ORFOIS, IRONAGES, \nTRACTOR, CAVASSOO, EUROTROPH, OCMIP (Phase 1 and Phase \n2), GOSAC, NAOC, and NOCES. These projects were more focused, \neach specifically targeting a special aspect or discipline of ma-\nrine carbon cycle research: \nORFOIS \u2013 fate of biogenic particle fluxes as well as sedimenta-\ntion and their relation to carbon cycling, \nIRONAGES \u2013 role of iron in biogenic carbon cycling, \nTRACTOR \u2013 tracer transport in northern deep-water production \nareas, \nCAVASSOO \u2013 estimate of North Atlantic carbon uptake through \nvoluntary observing ships, \nEUROTROPH \u2013 nutrient and carbon cycling in coastal seas, \nOCMIP \u2013 carbon cycle model intercomparison,\nGOSAC \u2013 modelling the ocean carbon uptake taking into ac-\ncount deliberate carbon storage, \nNAOC \u2013 remote sensing of bio-optical properties in the ocean, \nNOCES \u2013 interannual to decadal variability of air-sea CO2 flux-\nes.\nIt was recognised that the results of these successful projects \nneeded exploitation in a concerted effort that would bring the \ndifferent streams of research together, make their work inter-\noperable, tackle the fragmentation of the European research \narea on marine carbon research and maintain the international \ncompetitiveness of the European research community. In the \nearly years of this decade, the European marine carbon research \ncommunity was not as well organised as the terrestrial research \ncommunity in the FP5 CarboEurope Cluster. Pioneering work was \nneeded to coordinate the marine carbon cycle community. The \n\u201cnew instrument\u201d of the FP6 \u201cIntegrated Project\u201d proved to be \noptimally suited for accomplishing just such an integration of \nmarine carbon cycle research. The design of the CarboOcean-IP \nIntegrated Project involved the key research leaders of previous \nprojects, who together created a horizontal project structure \nwith five major \u201ccore themes\u201d. The project planning started with \nan experts\u2019 meeting at the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences in \nAmsterdam, in April 2002. The project started officially on 1 \nJanuary 2005, and will continue until 31 December 2009. The \nCarboOcean-IP results cited in this report thus do not represent \nThe CarboOcean project\n\u2022 is the European contribution to the global observation net-\nwork on marine carbon.\n\u2022 has built up a worldwide link to the international carbon \ncycle research communities.\n\u2022 provides a European-wide integration of latest research re-\nsults on the marine carbon cycle. \n\u2022 contributes to guidelines for global change policy, such as \nthe IPCC assessment report.\n84\n2.1  Project and consortium goals: a concerted effort \nto reduce uncertainties\nthe final products of the project, but reveal insight into the very \nsuccessful on-going work of the CarboOcean-IP consortium.\nThe main aim of CarboOcean-IP is to reduce the present uncer-\ntainties in the quantification of net annual air-sea CO2 fluxes by \na factor of two for the world ocean and by a factor of four for \nthe Atlantic Ocean. The project will deliver description, proc-\ness-oriented understanding and prediction of the marine carbon \nsources and sinks with special emphasis on the Atlantic and \nSouthern Oceans on a time scale \u2013200 to +200 years from now. \nThe specific scientific objectives of the project and current \nprogress are (Fig. V.1):\n1. Description and quantification of the CO2 air-sea exchange on \na seasonal-to-interannual scale for the Atlantic Ocean and the \nSouthern Ocean:\nAn observing system for surface marine CO2 in the Atlantic has \nbeen implemented. Methods for diagnosing and predicting the \nAtlantic and Southern Ocean CO2 sinks through a combination \nof in situ measurements, satellite data, and models have been \ndeveloped. \n2. Quantification of decadal-to-centennial large-scale Atlantic and \nSouthern Ocean carbon inventory changes: \nThe Atlantic and Southern Ocean carbon sink, and its decadal \nchange, are being quantified through highest accuracy meas-\nurements of the changing inventories of inorganic carbon and \ncarbon-related tracers. Atlantic and Southern Ocean data have \nbeen integrated into a coherent global database. The ability of \nprognostic models to represent the observed changes for a reli-\nable nowcast is being assessed.\n3. Quantification of the carbon sources and sinks at the European \nregional scale:\nThe variability of carbon uptake and release, as well as the \nexchange of marginal seas with both the land and the open \nAtlantic Ocean, is being determined.  A pilot study on establish-\ning a closed carbon budget for Western Europe combining the \nmarine, terrestrial, and atmospheric compartments is under way \nin cooperation with the CarboEurope IP.\n4. Identification and understanding of biogeochemical feedback \nmechanisms which control marine carbon uptake and release: \nThe quantitatively important feedbacks between CO2 partial \npressure and other carbon cycle variables are being identified \nand analysed. Quantitative descriptions that can be used in \nmodels have been derived. Key regions for feedback processes \nhave been identified and strategies to monitor the evolution of \nfeedbacks are being developed.\n5. Integration of carbon observations into an integrated prognos-\ntic modelling framework: \nBest possible science-based projections of ocean carbon sink \nbehaviour for scenarios of future energy use and climatic change \nhave been carried out. The initial conditions for the scenarios \nhave been provided through model fields which have been vali-\ndated with observations. The models include revised formula-\ntions of new biogeochemical feedback mechanisms. \nA further goal of CarboOcean-IP is to coordinate data collec-\ntion and modelling, in particular to improve coordination with \nmarine carbon cycle research activities in the US.\nCarboOcean-IP is structured into five major \u201ccore themes\u201d which \ndirectly correspond to the five major goals presented above:\n1. North Atlantic and Southern Ocean CO2 air-sea exchange on \na seasonal-to-interannual scale. \n2. Detection of decadal-to-centennial Atlantic and Southern \nOcean carbon inventory changes.  \n3. Carbon uptake and release at the European regional scale.\n4. Biogeochemical feedbacks on the oceanic carbon sink.\n5. Future scenarios for marine carbon sources and sinks. \nThe CarboOcean-IP consortium was selected to combine the key \nEuropean research institutions for marine carbon cycle research. \nThe consortium of contractors and associate partners consists \nof about 200 scientists from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, United \nKingdom, Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland, The Nether-\nlands, Poland, Iceland, Spain, Ireland, Morocco, Canada, and \nthe United States of America. Altogether 50 different groups are \nworking in CarboOcean-IP, including 35 contracting partners. \nThe project is being coordinated by the University of Bergen \nand the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway. \nTheses institutions host the project office with the coordina-\ntor, scientific project manager, financial\/administrative project \nmanager, and a scientific data manager. \nFig. V.1: Goals\/core themes\/objectives of CarboOcean-IP (Source: CarboOcean-\nIP consortium). Core Theme (CT1, objective 1) provides a description and \nquantification of the CO2 air-sea exchange on a seasonal-to interannual scale \nfor the Atlantic Ocean and the Southern Ocean which is extended by CT2 to \na decadal-to-centennial time-frame also involving the deep ocean (objective \n2). A special focus is on the quantification of the carbon sources and sinks \nat a regional scale (CT3, objective 3). CT4 deals with the identification and \nunderstanding of biogeochemical feedback mechanisms which control marine \ncarbon uptake and release (objective 4). Finally, the new data and knowledge \nwill be integrated into CT5 where prognostic modelling with complex climate \nmodels is carried out to finally help guide sustainable development manage-\nment (objective 5: prediction and future assessment).\nGuiding the management of\nsustainable development\nObjective 5:\nPrediction, future assessment\nObjective 1: Short-term assessment\nInitial conditions\nObjective 2:\nLong term\nassessment\nCO2\nemissions\nBoundary conditions\nObjective 3:\nAssessment of\nRegional European\nContribution\nSystem dynamics\nObjective 4:\nAssessment of\nfeedbacks\n85\n2.2  Variable sink strength in North Atlantic and \nSouthern Ocean\n2.2 Variable sink strength in North Atlantic and South-\nern Ocean\nThe key regions of the World Ocean that govern the up-\ntake of anthropogenic carbon are those areas where wa-\nter is transported downward from the surface to greater \ndepth. In these regions, surface water, that carries high \nloads of anthropogenic carbon, can reach deeper layers \nthrough intermediate and deep-water production mecha-\nnisms, while water that is not yet saturated with respect \nto anthropogenic carbon enters the upper ocean. Because \nthe water column is stably stratified in most parts of the \nocean, there is normally little exchange of water between \nthe surface and depth: downward transport of anthropo-\ngenic carbon only occurs in the intermediate and deep-\nwater production areas which, acting as a bottleneck, thus \nplay a decisive role in the ocean\u2019s uptake kinetics with \nrespect to man-made carbon. Such deep and intermediate \nwater production areas exist in the northern North Atlan-\ntic, especially in the Labrador Sea, the Greenland Sea, and \nthe Arctic Ocean margin. They also occur in the South-\nern Ocean, especially in the Weddell and Ross Seas and at \nthe Sub-Antarctic Front. The North Atlantic and Southern \nOcean therefore carry a considerable load of anthropogenic \ncarbon (Sabine et al., 2004). It is particularly important to \nquantify the carbon sinks in these key areas and to assess \npotential changes and variability in sink strength.\nAn accurate assessment of the entire North Atlantic carbon \nsink is equally important, because it is needed to make \nreliable quantitative estimates of the air-land CO2 fluxes \nfor North America and Eurasia. The internationally bind-\ning commitments on greenhouse gas reductions require \naccurate estimates of regional emissions. Without precise \nknowledge of the oceanic carbon sink, there would be con-\nsiderable ambiguity associated with estimates of carbon \nfluxes solely based on air-land flux data. \nFor the Atlantic Ocean, especially the North Atlantic, a \ncarbon observing system, first implemented in the EU \nCAVASSOO project (2000-2003), is now fully operational \nin Core Theme 1 of CarboOcean-IP (2005-2008). Form-\ning the backbone of this observing system are automated \nmeasurements of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in sea \nsurface water and marine air, and surface water salinity \nand temperature. A series of automated systems are in-\nstalled mainly on commercial ships (voluntary observing \nships, \u201cVOS lines\u201d, Fig. V.2) with a regular and frequent \nsailing schedule, but also on research vessels (Table 1). \nNotwithstanding the difficulties in the approach, such as \nthe occasional rescheduling of commercial ships, these \nmeasurements are providing unprecedented observational \ndata coverage of Atlantic CO2 surface partial pressures and \nair-sea pCO2 differences.\nFig. V.2: The North Atlantic carbon observing system is one of the highlights \nof the CarboOcean programme. The temperate and sub-polar Atlantic has been \ninvestigated with the help of VOS-lines (\u201cvoluntary observing ships\u201d) to reduce \nthe uncertainty in the North Atlantic sink by providing seasonal and annual \nregional air-sea CO2 fluxes with unprecedented accuracy. In order to continue to \nobtain new data, commercial ships, such as the MV Benguela Stream (\u201cBanana \nboat\u201d to the left) were also equipped with a pCO2 measurement system. With \nthe help of these continuous data, scientists can monitor the North Atlantic \nsink and quantify how the CO2 uptake changes over time and varies for different \nlatitudes. (Source: T.

As \nthe observations sample only a small part of the \nocean, suitable methods have to be used to in-\nterpolate the measurements and to upscale lo-\ncal CO2 fluxes between air and water to a larger \narea. This is carried out with a procedure based \non the existing in situ data, using interpolation \ntechniques, ocean general circulation models, \nremote sensing data, and data assimilation \nmethods.  Based on the observational sea sur-\nface pCO2 data, pCO2 maps have been created by \na number of methods, including neural networks \nand multi-linear regression (Olsen et al., 2008; \nTelszewski et al., 2008). Estimates of North At-\nlantic sea surface pCO2 (such as the estimate \nfor 2005 shown in Figure V.4) can now be \nmade annually and for most seasons to within \na 10% relative error. This is an unprecedented \naccuracy for basin wide estimates. The overall \nNorth Atlantic CO2 sink has been calculated to \nbe 70 percent of the climatological average. \nThis is substantially less than the \u201cTakahashi \nclimatology\u201d for the region (Takahashi et al., \n2002; Takahashi et al., in press). This change \nreflects our previous conclusion that the flux \nin the region as a whole has declined over the \nlast decade (Lef\u00e8vre et al., 2004; Omar and \nOlsen, 2006, Corbi\u00e8re et al., 2007, Schuster and \nWatson, 2007) (Fig. V.5). \nFig. V.3: The CarboOcean-IP programme not only employs research vessels, but also commercial \nships. These volunteer observing ships (VOS) help to efficiently create a large database at rather \nlow cost. This figure shows the cruise tracks of the VOS lines used in the northern Atlantic Ocean. \n(Source: CarboOcean-IP 2008, 3rd annual report, Andrew Watson and colleagues)\nFig. V.5: Varying North Atlantic sink strength as deduced from a suite of col-\nlaborative projects. In the early years of the 21st century the North Atlantic \nCO2 sink was only 50% of that in the mid-1990s. Recent data show that the \nCO2 sink is slowly recovering. These findings show that the CO2 sink is highly \nvariable; continuous observations are needed to capture this variability. \n(Source: Andrew Watson)\nFig. V.4: From detailed investigation in the North Atlantic region, we know \nthat the North Atlantic carbon sink strength depends on latitude and varies \nseasonally as shown in this diagram for the year 2005. Fluxes from the at-\nmosphere into the ocean were highest between 30-40 \u00baN during January to \nJuly 2005. High latitude waters took up CO2 during the whole year, whereas \nthe lower latitude waters took up CO2 during January to June 2005. However \nthe latter then released some of it again to the atmosphere during the rest \nof the year, especially during the summer period (July to September). These \nresults are based on data from the CarboOcean-IP observing system. \n(Source: Andrew Watson)\n80\u00b0N\n60\u00b0N\n40\u00b0N\n20\u00b0N\nEQ\n80\u00b0W 60\u00b0W 40\u00b0W 20\u00b0W 0\u00b0 20\u00b0E\nOc\nea\nn \nDa\nta\n V\nie\nw\n10 to 20\u00b0N\n20 to 30\u00b0N\n30 to 40\u00b0N\n40 to 50\u00b0N\n50 to 65\u00b0N\nJFM\nAMJ\nJAS\nOND\n-0.02\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n2005\nLa\ntit\nud\ne\nSeason\nFl\nux\n [\nGt\n y\nr-1\n]\n0\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\nYear\nFl\nux\n [\nPg\n C\n y\nr-1\n]\n1994\/5 to 2005\nTakahashi climatology, 1995\nCavasoo era\nCarbo-Ocean\n88\n2.2  Variable sink strength in North Atlantic and \nSouthern Ocean\nHowever, evaluation of more recent pCO2 measurements indi-\ncates a partial recovery of the North Atlantic sink in 2006 and \n2007 (Schuster and CarboOcean-IP-Team, 2008) (Fig. V.6), \nemphasising the need for sustained long-term observations of \nair-sea carbon fluxes in key regions of the world ocean (IOCCP, \n2007; Metzl et al., 2007). The international context provided by \nEU funding is ideal for operating such an observational network, \nas no single country can run more than a few VOS lines.\nA series of data assimilation and interpolation procedures for \nupscaling the measurements to basin wide fluxes has been \ntested and successfully applied. These techniques, which in-\nclude neural network and adjoint modelling techniques, also \ntake into account biologically induced variations of sea surface \npCO2 through a combination of process parameterisations in \nthe models, in situ measurements, and chlorophyll data derived \nfrom ocean-colour satellite measurements.\nTo assess Southern Ocean air-sea CO2 fluxes, a comprehensive \nobservational programme is being carried out; surface water CO2 \nobservations and process studies in the Atlantic and Indian sec-\ntors of the Southern Ocean are already underway. A total of six \nfreely drifting CARIOCA buoys equipped with CO2 sensors have \nbeen deployed in the Southern Ocean. A first estimate based \non the CARIOCA measurements indicates 0.8 Pg C yr-1 of CO2 \nuptake in the sub-Antarctic zone. Analysis of a large ship-data-\nbase south of Tasmania has revealed locally in the sub-tropical-\nzone and in the sub-Antarctic-zone very significant inter-annual \nvariability related to the Southern Annular Mode using a purely \nobservational approach (Borges et al. 2008). Locally, large pCO2 \nvariations due to biological export production have been ob-\nserved near the Sub-Antarctic Front and the Crozet and Ker-\nguelen Islands (Bakker et al., 2007; Jouandet et al., 2008) by \nshipboard and buoy measurements, and satellite observations. \nIce covered CO2\u2013rich waters were found to rapidly change to a \nmajor CO2 sink in the Weddell Sea during sea ice melt in early \nsummer (Bakker et al., 2008).  Using a combination of forward \nmodelling and data-driven inverse atmospheric simulations, Le \nQu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. (2007) could attribute a decrease in the CO2 sink \nstrength for the Southern Ocean from 1992 to 2004 to interan-\nnual variation in the climate system. This is in line with direct \nobservations of the sea surface CO2 partial pressure, which so far \nat least leads to the conclusion that the sink for atmospheric \nCO2 in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean has not \nincreased during recent years (though the atmospheric CO2 con-\ntinued to rise). Following up this issue is a challenge for the \nexperimental oceanographers because of the low data coverage \nfor the remote Southern Ocean, which few ships visit in the \nwinter months. \nFig. V.6: Surface ocean CO2 trend for the Indian Ocean section of the Southern Ocean based on direct in situ measurements. The flux of CO2 between air and \nwater depends on the difference in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and the surface ocean. The surface ocean CO2 partial pressure appears to rise faster \nthan the atmospheric CO2 partial pressure indicating the possibility of a decrease in Southern Ocean sink strength for anthropogenic CO2.

We cannot \nyet justify giving a single number for the oceanic uptake of \nanthropogenic CO2 in the key regions of the North Atlantic \nand Southern Ocean, but valid flux estimates for selected \nperiods and regions have been successfully calculated.\nKey questions:\nThe data coverage for in situ CO2 partial pressure \nmeasurements needs to be increased. For the North Atlantic \na reasonably good coverage has been achieved since 2005 \nusing regular VOS lines, but no funding is available to \nmaintain the observational network after 2008. Regular VOS \ndata collection requires sustained and long-term funding. \nAn international framework is ideal for coordinating Carbon \nObserving systems.\nThe CO2 fluxes in the remote Southern Ocean are poorly \nknown. \nThe reason for the decrease in CO2 sink strength is not \nyet fully understood, in particular we need to unravel the \ninterdependency of physical, large-scale forcing, biological \nactivity, and lateral transport of water with varying degrees of \nanthropogenic carbon loads. A dense observational network \nand higher resolution modelling is needed.\n90\n2.3  Best estimates of anthropogenic carbon water co-\nlumn loads and their changes\n2.3 Best estimates of anthropogenic carbon water column \nloads and their changes \nDetecting the current amount of anthropogenic carbon in the \nocean is a major research challenge. The sparseness of the \navailable observations, the varying three-dimensional fields in \nthe ocean, the small signal to noise ratio, and the lack of high \naccuracy data before the 1990s, all make it difficult to establish \nglobal-ocean, anthropogenic carbon uptake. In fact, we have \nno direct data at all from before the industrial revolution, from \nwhich to derive the carbon content of the unperturbed ocean. \nIt is even more difficult to establish decadal changes in oceanic \nwater column storage. The best prospect of filling this gap in \nour knowledge is to use techniques that track backwards in \ntime. These techniques use our knowledge of the thermoha-\nline circulation of the ocean, ocean biological processes, ocean \nchemistry, sedimentation, climate change and air-sea gas ex-\nchange, to reconstruct the past oceans carbon cycles. Similarly, \nwe can then also project the future ocean anthropogenic carbon \nuptake.\nAs the net uptake of anthropogenic carbon by the ocean pro-\nceeds, there is a corresponding increase in the within-ocean \ninventory of carbon. This change in the oceanic carbon inven-\ntory is quantitatively equivalent to the oceanic carbon sink and \nreflects the integrated effects of the direct and indirect hu-\nman perturbations of the carbon cycle. The 3-D carbon analysis \nwithin CarboOcean-IP is working to quantify this integrated \ncarbon sink using observations and models of changes in carbon \nstored within the ocean. The WOCE \/ JGOFS Global CO2 Survey \nof the 1990s produced an initial estimate of the anthropogenic \nCO2 inventory of the World Ocean based on observations, as \nwell as several model runs. So far, the observational estimates \nhave tended to focus on the overall inventory of anthropogenic \nCO2 (i.e. the \u201cextra\u201d inorganic carbon stored in the ocean since \nabout 1750). Although there is some controversy and disagree-\nment over estimation methods, overall, the uncertainties of \nsuch approaches in estimating total inventories of anthropo-\ngenic CO2 in the oceans are well recognised. The uncertainties \nin observational approaches relate to doubtful assumptions; for \nmodel realisations, the uncertainties lie with the parameterisa-\ntion of complex ocean dynamics, including representation of \nkey vertical motions. The Southern Ocean is one particular area \nwhere the uncertainties are particularly noticeable and impor-\ntant. \nCarboOcean-IP scientists, and international collaborators from \nother programmes, have carried out an enormous synthesis task \nin the field of ocean-interior carbon data collection and docu-\nmentation, producing a consistent, high quality data set for \nthe Atlantic Ocean. Here, CarboOcean-IP scientists are work-\ning closely with scientists from all over the world in a global \nocean carbon synthesis approach motivated by the following \ninternational projects: Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Stud-\nies (SOLAS) and Integrated Marine Biogeochemistry and Eco-\nsystem Research (IMBER) Joint Carbon Group, and the Inter-\nnational Ocean Carbon Coordination Panel (IOCCP) sponsored \nby the IGBP, SCOR, WRCP and UNESCO. An enormous collection \nof previously unavailable carbon, tracer, oxygen, nutrient and \nhydrographic data from the North Atlantic and sections of the \nSouthern Ocean are now to be found in the CARINA data set. \nThis data set is already publicly available. But the final quality-\nchecked data will be published during the autumn to early win-\nter 2008 and will include all data produced up to 2006.\nDuring the course of this work new routines for correcting data, \ncrossover techniques etc., have been developed. These are now \navailable to all seagoing scientific groups in the world and serve \nas best practice for data correction and for obtaining consist-\nency between cruises. Applying these common procedures will \nhelp to keep consistency between data sets. CarboOcean-IP sci-\nentists have made a strong contribution to building up these \nroutines. A series of CarboOcean-IP research cruises have also \ncollected new deep-section carbon datasets of the highest ac-\ncuracy. \nA suite of methods is available for calculating anthropogenic \nCO2 content in the ocean. These methods are based on different \ncarbon-related measurements and correct for processes, like bi-\nology, that also affect the ocean CO2 concentration: CFC-short-\ncut (Thomas and Ittekkot, 2001), TTD transit time distributions \n(Waugh, 2004, 2006), TroCA (Touratier and Goyet, 2004), IPSL \nmethod (Lo Monaco et al., 2005), \u0394C* (Gruber et al., 1996, \nMatsumoto and Gruber, 2005), eMLRs (Friis et al., 2005) and \nthe Tanhua approach (Tanhua et al., 2007). \nThe answers provided by these methods still differ. Most of the \nmethods are not very reliable in high latitude environments, \nbut in general, and looking at the globe as a whole, they per-\nform relatively well \u2013 especially considering that the low con-\ncentration of anthropogenic CO2 makes it difficult to measure. \nSome areas, like the sub-polar gyre system in the North Atlantic \nOcean, are relatively uncritical because of the high uptake of \nanthropogenic CO2 in these areas. We need to assess how deep \nthe anthropogenic CO2 has penetrated and how far the anthro-\npogenic CO2 has followed the deep current systems which origi-\nnate from source waters produced by deep-water formation, but \nthis is a difficult task. Most of the uncertainties stem from lack \nof measurements and low data coverage in time and space. But \nstill from a global perspective the different approaches give a \nrelatively consistent mean. Nevertheless, improvement is still \nneeded to reduce the uncertainties. In general, there is a strong \nneed to understand the processes related to anthropogenic CO2 \nuptake, how they vary in time and space, and how sensitive they \nare to climate and environmental changes. Figure V.7 gives an \nexample for the North Atlantic Ocean of the reconstruction of \nanthropogenic carbon loads in the water column.\n91\n2.3  Best estimates of anthropogenic carbon water co-\nlumn loads and their changes\nIn addition to these back calculation methods, forward models \nas well as inverse methods have been used to estimate the an-\nthropogenic carbon inventory in the oceans and to investigate \nhow it might vary. Five different Earth system models have been \nforced with anthropogenic CO2 emissions as compiled by Mar-\nland et al. (2007) for the period 1751-2004. The water column \nanthropogenic CO2 burdens for all models show the maximum in \nthe North Atlantic, as do the data-derived methods of, e.g., Sab-\nine et al. (2004). However, there are considerable differences \nbetween these methods, especially in the Southern and Pacific \nOceans. The inverse approach has been presented in papers by \ne.g. Brewer et al.

(1998),  Alvarez et al. \n(2003), and, most recently, by Mikaloff Fletcher et al (2007). \nFigure V.8 shows a summary of anthropogenic carbon stor-\nage and transport estimates across zonal sections taken from \na number of published studies. In principle, they estimate the \nanthropogenic carbon content along East-West going sections. \nThe transport direction of currents is perpendicular to these \nsections, and thus oriented North and South. The transport rate \nand the anthropogenic carbon content in the East-West sections \nwill balance if correct. The change in ocean storage can be seen \nas the difference in air-to-sea transfer today compared to that \n200 years ago \u2013 before the industrial revolution. This inversely \ndetermined \u201cperturbation flux\u201d cannot be measured directly, \nbut can be a significant component of the air-sea CO2 flux as \nestimated by direct sea surface pCO2 measurements. The two \napproaches correspond to the \u2018dual approach\u2019 as pursued by the \nterrestrial CarboEurope community, where the inverse method \nrepresents the \u201ctop-down\u201d and the direct pCO2 measurements \nthe \u201cbottom-up\u201d methodology. The backtracking methods used \nby oceanographers are a similar approach, but here the trans-\nfer is estimated from differences between today\u2019s and the pre-\nanthropogenic ocean.\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5 5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n10\n10\n10 10\n10\n10\n10\n15 15\n15\n15\n20 20\n20\n20 20\n25 25\n25 25\n30 30 30\n40 40 4050 50\n5060\n60\n6060\n60 6070 70\nC\nant\nDistance [km]\nDe\npt\nh \n [\nkm\n]\nCaribbean Mid Ocean Ridge Portugal\n  85oW   60o   35o   10o   15oE \n  18o \n  27o \n  36o \n  45o \n  54oN \nFig. V.7: Detection of existing anthropogenic carbon (Cant) in the ocean is challenging, as we do not have direct measurements of the oceanic carbon before \nthe industrial revolution.

Closely associated with this ability \nto measure changes in ocean carbon inventories is the increas-\ning ability to sample and measure the ocean interior using au-\ntonomous observation techniques. In particular, oxygen content \nis a carbon-related property that carries valuable information \nconcerning changing ocean carbon levels both in the ocean \nand the atmosphere. Oxygen data are used in almost all anthro-\npogenic carbon estimation approaches: oxygen, O2, is a tracer \nof water mass ventilation (or how often, how well, and since \nwhen, the water has equilibrated with the atmosphere), which, \nbecause it can be measured at high density, can be used to \nguide interpolation between sparse measurements of inorganic \ncarbon. CarboOcean-IP includes a technology development and \napplication component that is advancing our ability to monitor \noxygen (and ultimately carbon) inventories from a new genera-\ntion of profiling floats. An example of the use of these floats is \ngiven in Figure V.9.\nA new international joint Argo-Oxygen programme is planned \nto determine, on a global-scale, seasonal to decadal time-scale \nvariations in sub-surface dissolved oxygen concentrations. The \ntechnique and its implementation are developed in CarboOcean-\nIP WP10. The suggested approach is to add dissolved oxygen \nsensors to the floats of the successful Argo array, thus extend-\ning its measurement capabilities. Such a development will pro-\nvide new measurements of a key quantity for ocean ecology \nand biogeochemistry, and allow study and quantification of a \ndiverse and crucial set of processes. \nThese processes include the detection of the oceanic impact of \nglobal warming on ocean biogeochemistry and circulation, the \naddition of unprecedented constraints on the export of biologi-\ncally formed organic matter, and improved estimates of the oce-\nanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2. The addition of oxygen to the \ncurrently measured suite of temperature and salinity on Argo \nwill represent a revolutionary step in our ability to observe the \nocean\u2019s evolution over time, integrating biogeochemical and \nphysical observations.\nThe following issues justify the approach: \n\u2022 Detect changes in ocean biogeochemistry and climate,\n\u2022 Improve atmospheric O2\/N2 constraint on ocean\/land parti-\ntioning of anthropogenic CO2 ,\n\u2022 Determine seasonal to interannual changes in oxygen in sub-\nmixed layer waters as a proxy for net community production \nand export production,\n\u2022 Aid interpretation of variations in ocean circulation\/mixing, \n\u2022 Provide constraints for ocean biogeochemistry models, \n\u2022 Aid in interpretation of sparse data from repeat hydrographic \nsurveys, \n\u2022 Determine transport and regional air-sea fluxes of oxygen and \nfinally,\n\u2022 Prediction and assessment of anoxic or hypoxic events.\nRobust findings:\nThe findings from independent approaches (data analysis, \nforward, and inverse modelling) seem to converge and lead \nto the conclusion that:\n\u2022 the ocean has indeed taken up large amounts of \nanthropogenic carbon since the pre-industrial era, and\n\u2022 the maximum for the water column burdens of human-made \nCO2 is in the northern North Atlantic close to the areas of \ndeep convection, \n\u2022 the Southern Ocean also carries significant amounts of \nanthropogenic carbon. \nKey questions:\nThe data coverage in the Southern Ocean is still small. \nInterdecadal variations in anthropogenic carbon storage can \nso far only be determined for the limited regions where there \nis sufficient data coverage.\nMeasurements of oxygen and carbon through autonomous \nfloats need to be considerably extended in order to allow \nbetter estimates (top-down) of integrated air-sea CO2 fluxes \nand carbon storage.\n94\n2.4  Carbon fluxes at the transition land- shelf sea - \nopen ocean\n2.4 Carbon fluxes at the transition land- shelf sea - open \nocean\nA comprehensive understanding of the carbon balance at a \ncontinental scale must include all the relevant compartments: \nland, atmosphere as well as coastal and open oceans. Land, at-\nmosphere and coastal ocean maintain a triangular relationship, \nwith exchange of matter and energy between all compartments \nand in all directions. The coastal ocean is highly variable, with \na complex pattern of fluxes, for example: riverine inputs de-\nliver a variety of compounds from the terrestrial to the coastal \nocean compartment; the intrusion of salt water into rivers or \ndirectly onto land, as regular (e.g. tides) or extreme events, \nproduces transport of matter in the reverse direction; deposi-\ntion of terrestrial material to the coastal ocean via the atmos-\nphere is another pathway. Airborne and riverine nitrate supply \nto the coastal ocean, which is often of the same order of mag-\nnitude, constitutes a major fuel for marine primary productivity. \nSimilar considerations apply to carbon exchange between land \nand coastal ocean. The coastal ocean is the only marine area \nwhere land and ocean are linked at short time scales through \natmospheric deposition and riverine sediments. This rapid link-\nage creates various feedbacks and biogeochemical interactions. \nFurthermore, the coastal ocean at the interface between land \nand open ocean acts as a link, with bi-directional exchange of \nmatter between both compartments. \nDespite the high variability and heterogeneity of the coastal \nocean at a global scale, there have been several recent attempts \nto describe and quantify the role of the coastal ocean in the \nglobal and marine carbon cycles. These investigations have in-\ncreased our understanding of coastal oceans at the global scale, \nbut at regional or local scale the diversity and variability of \nthe coastal systems (Borges, 2005, Borges et al., 2006, Ciais \net al., 2008; Chen and Borges, 2008) still prevents us from \nachieving a comprehensive understanding. An example of this \nis evident in the assessment of the European carbon balance, \nusing bottom-up and top-down approaches. The uncertainties \nof \u201cknown\u201d individual fluxes far exceed the order of magnitude \nassumed for fluxes involving the coastal ocean, in particular the \nlateral exchange between land and coastal ocean. Creating the \nnecessary understanding of the role of the coastal ocean in the \ncarbon balance will only be achieved by detailed field studies. \nOnly these will provide the required information to constrain \nintegrative modelling studies.\nCarboOcean-IP has a core theme making a carbon sink assess-\nment for regional European seas. This theme will start to link \nEuropean shelf sea measurements with terrestrial carbon fluxes \nand open-ocean fluxes. Quantifying the fluxes for these hetero-\ngeneous and variable shelf seas presents a special challenge, \nparticularly when drawing up the type of comprehensive assess-\nments such as those aimed for by CarboOcean-IP. CarboOcean-\nIP decided to focus on those European Seas, which are directly \nconnected to the Atlantic: namely, the North Sea and the Medi-\nterranean Sea. A comprehensive observational and modelling \nprogramme is being undertaken, which tackles several key as-\npects of the problem, for both sea systems. In a joint-venture \nwith CarboEurope-IP (which covers the partial budgets of the \natmosphere and the land), CarboOcean-IP will, for the first time \never, quantify all relevant fluxes between sea, land and air. \nWestern Europe is the first case study being pursued with this \npioneering, integrated approach,\nA considerable amount of new oceanic and atmospheric data \nhas already been collected for both the North Sea and the NW \nMediterranean. This new data is added to existing data, creat-\ning new datasets that will enable us to unravel the spatial and \ntemporal variability of the systems. The result will be new in-\nsight into the carbon balance of these coastal seas, from local \nto basin-wide and at daily, via seasonal, to multi-annual and \ndecadal time scales.\nPioneering studies on the seasonal variability of the North Sea \ncarbon cycle (Thomas et al., 2004) and how it is controlled, \nfor example by the Baltic Sea runoff, are currently being com-\nplemented by high resolution time series observations in the \nsouthern North Sea. Combining observations and modelling, \nthese studies provide highly detailed, process-based insight \ninto the land-ocean coupling (Schiettecatte et al., 2005, 2007; \nBorges et al. 2008; Gypens et al., 2008; Prowe et al. 2008). For \nexample, investigations into the trophic state of the water can \nprovide insight into the effects and magnitude of lateral inputs, \nwhich may vary from local to basin wide scales. While the basin-\nwide biological carbon cycling of the North Sea as a whole is \nprimarily controlled by organic matter input from the Atlantic \n(Thomas et al., 2005), the Southern Bight in turn is strongly \naffected by organic matter inputs from land. \nThere is a clear relationship between the air-sea CO2 fluxes and \nthe trophic state of the water in the Southern Bight, which thus \ncan be considered as an indicator of lateral carbon exchange \nbetween land and coastal ocean \u2013 one of the key unknown \nprocesses mentioned above. These investigations are being ex-\ntended to basin-wide scales to research the role of tidal mud \nflats on the North Sea carbon cycle. There is new evidence that \nthe CO2 uptake by the North Sea is facilitated to a surprisingly \nlarge extend by anaerobic processes within the tidal wetlands \nand mud flats, which in turn are in partly fuelled by terrestrial \nsupplies (Thomas et al., 2008). These studies are paralleled by \ninvestigations on the role of tidal wetlands (see Page 97), and \nthe overall North Sea, on atmospheric CO2 concentrations, based \non measurements from a North Sea oil\/gas platform \u201cF3\u201d, about \n300 km north of the Dutch coast, and a measurement tower \nin the tidal margin of the Wadden Sea (Fig. V.10). The fluxes \nfor example from the latter (Klaassen et al., 2007) reveal clear \ndaily and seasonal cycles.\n95\n2.4  Carbon fluxes at the transition land- shelf sea - \nopen ocean\nInterestingly, the atmospheric data mirror both the North Sea \nand Atlantic Ocean signal and can be used to understand the \nvariability of the CO2 systems in both marine areas at seasonal \nto decadal time scales (e.g. Schuster and Watson 2007, Thomas \net al., 2007a,b).\nFor the NW Mediterranean a similar structure has been estab-\nlished. For example, more than ten cruises have been carried \nout in the Strait of Gibraltar to assess the exchange with the \nAtlantic Ocean. The role of the Mediterranean Sea in absorb-\ning anthropogenic CO2 has also been evaluated (A\u00eft-Ameur and \nGoyet, 2006) (Fig. V.11). The Mediterranean outflow waters, \nwhich lie underneath the Atlantic Ocean water masses (e.g. Fig. \nV.11c) entering the Mediterranean, contribute considerably to \nthe mid-depth water masses of the Atlantic Ocean (high salinity \ncompound) and also carry significant amounts of anthropogenic \ncarbon into the ocean\u2019s interior. The oceanic observations and \nmodelling studies are being complemented by a time series of \natmospheric observations at \nthe French station DYFMAED, \nin the Gulf of Lions. These ac-\ntivities in the North Sea and \nthe NW Mediterranean link \nCore Theme 3 to Core Themes \n1 and 5 of CarboOcean-IP.\nThe atmospheric observations \nover the marine areas, as well \nas air-flux estimates for these \nareas constitute the link to \nthe third branch of CT3, the \nEUROPEAN integration, which \napplies top-down and bottom-\nup modelling approaches to \nconstrain the European Car-\nbon balance. The studies are \nparalleled by socio-economic \nassessments of firstly emis-\nsion scenarios, and then by \nthe evaluation of costs related \nto potential mitigation sce-\nnarios.\nFig. V.10: CO2 air-sea fluxes measured above the Dutch Wadden Sea.\nCO2 fluxes are generally larger in the summer (days 120-270) and reverse sign \nover a 24 hour cycle (outgasssing at night, uptake during daylight). The sink \nmay be overestimated due to preferential measuring on bright days. \n(Source: W.

Delmotte, P. Ciais, J. Lavric, M. Ramonet\nImproving our understanding of the role of greenhouse gases \nwithin the carbon cycle is a top priority of climate change \nresearch. Human activities release a huge amount of carbon \ndioxide into the atmosphere (about 9 billion tonnes of car-\nbon per year) of which only 45% stays in the atmosphere. \nThe remaining part is absorbed by natural carbon sinks: the \nterrestrial vegetation and the oceans. On a global scale both \nsinks contribute nearly equally to the carbon absorption, but \nat a regional scale the picture is more complex, demanding a \nbetter understanding of the processes involved. In particular, \nwe need to know more about the role of the oceans. Within \nthe framework of the CarboOcean-IP European project, LSCE \n(CEA-CNRS-UVSQ, France) installed a new monitoring station \nto continuously follow the atmospheric CO2 and O2 concentra-\ntion throughout the summer of 2007. The dual measurements \nof CO2 and O2 are providing new information that will help us \nto better constrain the role of the Atlantic Ocean in the North \nAtlantic region. The station has been set up in Ivittuut, South-\nern Greenland on the shore of the Arsuk Fjord (Fig. V.12). This \nsite was chosen because of its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean \nat the confluence of air masses coming from either North \nAmerica or Europe, and because of the logistical facilities pro-\nFig. V.12: Arsuk Fjord, the Danish navel base of Gr\u00f8nnedal can be seen in \nthe foreground. The Arsuk fjord is about 5 km wide and 800 m deep, and 5 \nkm way from the open Atlantic Ocean (Source: M.

Morel, Our polar \nheritage, 2007)\nvided by the local Danish naval base in Gr\u00f8nnedal (5 km away \nfrom the station). The monitoring station was installed in a \nfield laboratory that we have equipped with a meteorological \nstation and CO2 and O2 monitoring instruments. Atmospheric \nair samples are collected continuously ,through four air inlets \ninstalled on a mast. Figure V.13 shows the scientists at work \nduring the installation of the air inlets and lines on the mast \n(J.V. Lavric and M. Delmotte).\nAir is pumped through the lines and then dried before being \ninjected into the instruments. The moisture is removed from \nthe air in two steps. The air is first cooled down to 1-2\u00b0C while \npassing through water traps placed in a fridge (see Figure \nV.14 illustrating the cold traps placed in the fridge of the \noxygen analyser) and it is then directed to another water trap \nplaced in an alcohol bath at -90 \u00b0C; this ensures that there \nis no residual moisture in the air. The dry air is then injected \ninto the analyser for measurement. As a further control on the \nquality of the continuous measurements and to allow us to \nmake complementary analyses of other greenhouse gases (CH4, \nN2O, SF6, CO, H2, isotopic composition of the CO2), we also fill \n1 litre air flasks using a sampling unit that has been devel-\noped at LSCE. The flasks are sent back to LSCE where they are \nindependently analysed in the central laboratory. Figure V.15 \nshows the sampling unit and the sampling flasks during a field \ntest before the final installation in the atmospheric station.\n97\n2.4  Carbon fluxes at the transition land- shelf sea - \nopen ocean\nRobust findings:\nEuropean regional seas, including enclosed and semi-\nenclosed seas, play an important role in the carbon budget, \ne.g. through the Mediterranean Sea outflow into the North \nAtlantic and the continental shelf pump mechanism of the \nNorth Sea. The first measurement stations for atmospheric \nCO2 in the Wadden Sea and in the North Sea present a \npromising outlook for improved continental scale greenhouse \ngas budgets.\nKey questions:\nCarbon and greenhouse gas budgets for coastal seas and shelf \nseas are difficult to establish in detail due to the complex \nboundary conditions and the heterogeneity of the marine \nsystems. For global greenhouse gas budgets and studies of \nbiogeochemical element cycling, a quantitatively correct \nsimulation of the coastal and shelf ocean on a global basis \nis needed. Such a simulation will be a major challenge for \nEarth system modellers in the coming decade. In-situ and \nsatellite measurements will be needed to validate respective \nmodel simulations.\nCarbon dioxide release by a tidal flat\nBy W.

One chamber was transparent for observations \nin light and the other was opaque and used for observations \nin darkness. Fluxes in darkness were defined as respiration, \nwhile photosynthesis was determined as the difference be-\ntween respiration and the flux in the light. Photosynthesis \nand respiration were related to temperature, irradiance and \ntidal cycle. Respiration increased exponentially with tem-\nperature, and photosynthesis increased almost proportion-\nally with irradiance. Fluxes were very low when the flat was \nflooded but increased gradually during the first three hours \nafter the tide had ebbed to expose the tidal flat. Data of a \nnearby meteorological tower were used to calculate weekly \nfluxes. Fluxes were high in summer and low in winter. Year-\nlong respiration (11.4 mol C m-2 yr-1) exceeded photosyn-\nthesis (6.2 mol C m-2 yr-1) so the tidal flat was a source of \natmospheric CO2.\nFig. V.17: Trial of the transparent flux chamber near the coast.

Rising atmos-\npheric CO2 levels since the beginning of the industrial revolu-\ntion and the consequent warming are driving profound changes \nto the physical and chemical state of the ocean. Temperature \ndriven changes in ocean circulation and stratification lead to \nlarge-scale changes in vertical marine carbon and nutrient dis-\ntributions. As a consequence marine ecosystems are altered in \ntheir structure and functioning. All these processes combine to \nsignificantly alter physical and biological carbon pumps. They \nultimately affect the efficiency with which the ocean can take \nup carbon and permanently remove it from the atmosphere. At \npresent, we are only just beginning to understand how rising \npCO2 will impact marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles, \nand how these changes will feed back on atmospheric pCO2. This \nhampers our capability to quantify physical and biogeochemi-\ncal feedback loops and to predict how they will change in the \nfuture. The approach of integrating observations and modelling \nadopted within CarboOcean-IP is designed to further our under-\nstanding of the relevant physical and biogeochemical processes \nand their complex interplay. \nThe high latitudes are hot spots of global climate change. The \neffects of changes in the rate of land ice melting, changes in \nsea-ice cover, marine density stratification and atmospheric forc-\ning conditions are combining to produce rapid climate change. \nIf the global ocean as a whole suffers from undersampling, this \nis even more true for the high latitudes. Nevertheless, a high \nquality description of the present status of the system is essen-\ntial if we are to predict the potential future evolution of high \nlatitude climate. \nA series of research cruises in the Arctic Ocean (R\/V Oden, \n2005, 2002) and the Barents Sea (marginal ice zone, R\/V Jan \nMayen (2003, 2004, 2005) led to a comprehensive data set of \nhydrographic and carbonate system measurements. These data \nare now available via the CarboOcean-IP data portal. Together \nwith data mining, the analysis of this new field data reveals the \nrelationship between physical and biogeochemical regimes, and \nsurface ocean pCO2 in the high latitude region from the North \nAtlantic inflow to the Nordic Seas, to the Eurasian Basin of the \nArctic Ocean. There is a high regional variability in the relative \nimportance of physical (ice cover, hydrography) and biogeo-\nchemical processes that dominates the surface CO2 system. The \ntiming and rate of ice melting, and the role of Arctic river runoff \nand biological productivity has been shown to significantly con-\ntrol both the carbonate system and air-sea CO2 exchange in the \nmarginal ice zone of the Barents Sea and Eurasian Basin of the \nArctic Ocean. A first attempt has been made to compile the pCO2 \nfield of the Arctic Ocean and to compute the potential uptake of \nCO2 by the surface waters (Jutterstr\u00f6m et al., in preparation). \nThis exercise highlights the potential for a substantial uptake of \nCO2 from the atmosphere in response to a decrease in summer \nsea ice coverage. Understanding and disentangling the process-\nes shaping the response of the Arctic Ocean to anthropogenic \nforcing is a central objective of CarboOcean-IP. As part of the \nefforts to meet this objective, we modelled (Kivim\u00e4e et al., sub-\nmitted) the relative roles of the solubility and biological pumps \nin preconditioning the carbon biogeochemical signatures of the \nBarents Sea water masses prior to transport and sequestration \nin Arctic intermediate and deep waters. Results stress the im-\nportance of the Norwegian Atlantic Current in controlling the \ncarbon flux from the Norwegian Sea to the Arctic Ocean, both \nvia Fram Strait and the Barents Sea. The latter is a net exporter \nof carbon originally coming from the Nordic Seas to the Arctic \nOcean with a net DIC export of ~2500 million tonnes of carbon \nper year, of which ~1800 million tonnes (72%) are in subsurface \nwater masses and thus sequestered from the atmosphere. The \nmajority of this carbon is imported from the Nordic Seas. The \nnet total organic carbon export to the Arctic Ocean is 80 million \ntonnes of carbon per year of which 20 million are labile.\nSouthern Ocean simulations with the OPA8-PISCES-T coupled \nphysical-biogeochemical model showed that the Southern \nOcean sink for CO2 has weakened, at least since 1980, because \nof the increase in upwelling caused by the intensification of \nthe southern ocean winds (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2007) (see also the \ndiscussion in the above section on the variable sink strength in \nthe Southern Ocean). \nA series of key biogeochemical processes were identified which \ninteract with atmospheric CO2. Considerable methodological ad-\nvances have been made through the use of large scale manipula-\ntive or mesocosm experiments, the marine counterpart to FACE \n(Free Air Carbon Enrichment) experiments for terrestrial ecosys-\ntems. Mesocosms are enclosures containing a large volume of \nseawater, including its biota, within transparent containers or \nbags (Fig. V.19). The first CarboOcean-IP mesocosm experiment \nwas carried out at the Espegrend facility near Bergen (Norway) \nin 2005.\nThis experiment investigated the response of dominant phyto-\nplankton groups to CO2 induced changes in carbonate chemis-\ntry. A set of parallel mesocosms was set up, each containing \nthe same ecosystem type. The atmospheric CO2 partial pressure \nwas then varied between 350 \u03bcatm, 700 \u03bcatm, and 1,050 \u03bcatm \n(Riebesell et al., 2008). The experiment lasted for 25 days dur-\ning which comprehensive biological and biogeochemical meas-\nurements were recorded.\n99\n2.5  Marine physical and biogeochemical feedbacks \nand impacts in a high CO2 world\nFig. V.19: How does the oceanic ecosystem react to a doubling of today\u2019s atmospheric CO2 concentration? This and other questions were investigated by running \nthe experiment \u201cthe first CarboOcean-IP mesocosm CO2 perturbation study\u201d in a Norwegian fjord. The experiment took place in the Raunefjord, 20 km South of \nBergen at University of Bergen\u2019s Large Scale Mesocosm Facility which was recently designated the National Mesocosm Centre by the Research Council of Norway. \nThe experiment lasted from 15 May to 15 June 2005, with one week prior to this for setting up the mesocosms and aerating the 10 m deep-water column inside \nthe mesocosm bags with CO2 enriched air. The 9 mesocosms, each covered with a polyethylene dome allowing 90% light transmission of the photosynthetically \nactive radiation (including UV-light), were adjusted to initial pCO2 levels of 375, 750 and 1150 ppmv (in triplicate) and were monitored during the develop-\nment and decline of a phytoplankton spring bloom. The results of this study, involving over 50 scientists from 14 European and North American institutions, \nare published in a special issue of Biogeosciences (http:\/\/www.biogeosciences.net\/special_issue38.html).

Riebesell)\nFig. V.20: Scanning electron micrographs of the single-celled coccolitho-\nphorid Calcidiscus quadriperforatus grown at present day (V.20a, above) \nand projected year 2100 CO2 levels (V.20b, below).\nMarine calcifiers in a high CO2 world \nBy U. Riebesell\nCalcium carbonate (CaCO3) is one of the most widespread \nbuilding materials used by marine organisms to form their \nshells and skeletons. Although the best known calcified \nstructures are probably corals, mollusks and echinoids, the \nmost productive calcifiers on Earth belong to a group of \nplanktonic microalgae, the coccolithophorids (Fig. V.20a). \nAs with all calcifying organisms they rely on surface seawater \nbeing supersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate. This \nsupersaturation prevents their crystallized CaCO3 from dis-\nsolving. Ocean acidification due to anthropogenic CO2 emis-\nsions progressively reduces carbonate saturation, a process \nwhich will cause large parts of the surface ocean to become \nsubsaturated with respect to calcium carbonate before the \nend of this century. Subsaturated waters will be corrosive to \ncalcium carbonate, making it impossible for calcifying organ-\nisms to maintain their shells and skeletons. But well before \nthe seawater turns subsaturated, organisms will find it in-\ncreasingly difficult to form their CaCO3 structures. Evidence \nfor this can be found in reduced rates of calcification. In coc-\ncolithophorids reduced calcilification also results in a drastic \nincrease in malformations, as shown in the right panel of the \nfigure below (Fig. V.20b). Despite much uncertainty about \nits broader implications for marine life, ocean acidification is \nlikely to cause major shifts in marine biodiversity and eco-\nsystem structure. \n100\n2.5  Marine physical and biogeochemical feedbacks \nand impacts in a high CO2 world\nIn agreement with earlier experiments on \u201cocean acidification\u201d \n(Zondervan et al., 2001), the organic carbon production in-\ncreased slightly under higher CO2 concentrations. Interestingly, \nthe microcosms with high CO2 conditions also showed increased \nnutrient utilisation efficiency. The detailed analysis of carbon to \nnitrogen drawdown during the mesocosm experiment revealed \nan enhanced carbon drawdown at higher than present atmos-\npheric CO2 levels, as well as an increase of the stoichiometric \nratio, C:N, from 6 at low, to 8 at high CO2 (Bellerby et al., 2007; \nRiebesell et al., 2007) (Fig. V.21). However, it is not yet clear, \nwhether this result can be extrapolated to other biological re-\ngimes. The mesocosm study allowed investigation of potential \nimpacts of rising atmospheric CO2 on ocean biogeochemistry, \nsuch as the emissions of the volatile organic gases, methanol, \nacetone, acetaldehyde, isoprene, DMS and chloroiodomethane, \nduring the development and decline of a phytoplankton bloom. \nExperimental results suggest that emissions of DMS and chlo-\nroiodomethane could increase with increasing atmospheric CO2 \nand in response to acidification. Further studies are needed to \nconfirm these results and to assess their potential impact on \nclimate, particularly in the case of the increase in DMS produc-\ntion with increasing CO2.\nLaboratory experiments have shown that the growth of the cy-\nanobacterium Trichodesmium in semi-continuous batch cultures \nis affected by CO2 concentrations, with higher rates being found \nat higher CO2 values. The ability to fix molecular nitrogen was \nalso CO2 sensitive. This might have important implications for \nfuture element cycling and ultimately affect the strength of the \nbiological carbon pump and hence atmospheric CO2 (Barcelos e \nRamos et al., 2007).\nExperiments investigating the temperature dependence of rem-\nineralisation of organic matter have confirmed the strong tem-\nperature control of the degradation of organic matter. Experi-\nments included water samples collected by the Danish vessel \nV\u00e6dderen while sailing from Antarctica, via the Panama Canal, \nto Copenhagen, Denmark. In addition, temperature regulated \nincubation experiments were also carried out on water collected \non three cruises in the transition zone between the North Sea \nand the Baltic Sea. Incubations were made at different tempera-\ntures over periods of 30 \u2013 100 days. DOM and POM remineralisa-\ntion rates show strong temperature dependence. \nThe database on CaCO3 fluxes recorded by sediment \ntraps and compiled during the FP5 project ORFOIS was \nused to evaluate the pelagic dissolution rate of car-\nbonate particles. The description of CaCO3 dissolution \nkinetics was updated in PISCES. The model computes \na carbonate budget in line with current estimates. To \nquantify the coupled calcification\/ballast feedback on \nrising atmospheric CO2, simulations were performed \nwith atmospheric pCO2 increasing at a rate of 1% per \nyear from the pre-industrial level to 4 times this value. \nCarbonate production (Fig. V.23) decreased by 27% in \nresponse to the pCO2 increase. Over the same period, \nexport decreased by 29%. The effect of reduced calci-\nfication leads to a total increase of the cumulative CO2 \nuptake of 6 Gt C over time, which is close to negligi-\nble in view of current and expected anthropogenic CO2 \nemissions.\nIn summary: CarboOcean-IP has been successfully \nstudying physical and biogeochemical feedbacks to \nincrease our limited knowledge of their influence on \npotential changes in the Earth system due to rising \nCO2 and changing temperature. However, at this stage \nit is too early for us to give an accurate quantified \ndescription of the physical\/biogeochemical feedbacks. \nHowever, such a quantified description is needed if we \nare to predict the future CO2 sink for given emission \nscenarios.\nFig. V.21: In the Bergen mesocosm experiment not only did the organic carbon produc-\ntion increase slightly under higher CO2 conditions but so did the nutrient utilisation \nefficiency. The stoichiometric ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) increased from 6 to \n8 under  high CO2 conditions. This figure shows the change in inorganic carbon taken \nout of the surface layer of a mesocosm, in relation to change in nutrients taken up \nby organisms in order to bind the inorganic carbon (after Riebesell et al., 2007). The \ncoloured lines stand for initial pCO2 values of 350 \u03bcatm (green), 700 \u03bcatm (grey) and \n1,050 \u03bcatm (red).

Gehlen\nA model sensitivity study was designed \nto evaluate the amplitude of changes \nin bottom-water($) carbonate chem-\nistry in response to an acidification \nscenario, as well as the potential for \ndissolution of marine calcium car-\nbonate (CaCO3) sediments on century \ntimescales (Gehlen et al., 2008). A \nmodel experiment was carried out ac-\ncording to the standard CMIP scenario \nof atmospheric pCO2 levels increasing \nat a rate of 1% per year from 286 to \n1144 ppm over a 140 year time pe-\nriod. The uptake of anthropogenic CO2 \nby the world ocean is the basic cause \nof a strong decrease in deep water \n[CO3\n2-] concentrations (Fig. V.22a). \nThe model predicts that the reduc-\ntion in [CO3\n2-] would be highest in \nareas of deep-water formation in the \nNorth Atlantic reaching 100 \u03bcM, as \nwell as intermediate and mode water \nformation in the Southern Hemisphere \n(30\u00b0S to 50\u00b0S). These regions corre-\nspond to those for which the highest \ncontemporary column inventories of \nanthropogenic CO2 were estimated by \nSabine et al. (2004). The reduction \nin [CO3\n2-] levels is accompanied by a \ndecrease in calcite saturation state of \nbottom-waters and drives the dissolu-\ntion of CaCO3. The model predicts a de-\ncrease in CaCO3 content averaged over \nthe top first centimetre by up to 6% \nover the course of the simulation (Fig. \nV.22b). Experimental evidence of the \neffects of CO2 on benthic communities \nis still scarce and mostly limited to \nshallow water biota (e.g., Shirayama \nand Thornton, 2005; Turley et al., \n2006).

Ecological \nimpacts may be severe (e.g. through warming and pH \nchanges). \nHigh latitude oceans are particularly sensitive to changes in \nclimate and carbon cycling, and thus can serve as a useful \n\u201cmagnifying glass\u201d for watching ongoing changes in the \nEarth system.\nKey questions:\nAt this stage, we are only beginning to understand the \nspectrum of potential changes in the Earth system due to \nrising CO2 and changing temperature. Many biogeochemical \nand ecological processes are not yet understood and can \nonly be simulated by empirical approaches. Models based \non more stringent \u201cfirst principles\u201d are needed. Laboratory, \nmesocosm, and in situ experiments need to be carried out in \norder to estimate the system response to a warming world \nwith increasing levels of greenhouse gases. \nFig. V.23: How can we upscale local process studies in the large-scale ocean? To answer this question, a model was used to simulate the calcium carbonate \nproduction with respect to increased CO2 contents over time. This figure shows the net CaCO3 production and CaCO3 dissolution under different atmospheric \nCO2 concentrations: (a) Vertically integrated net production of CaCO3 (g C m\n-2 yr-1) at 1\u00d7pCO2 (= pre-industrial): 27% less CaCO3 is produced in response to \nan increase in atmospheric CO2 and (b) difference in net production at 2\u00d7pCO2 minus 1\u00d7pCO2: 29% of the produced CaCO3 gets dissolved (After Gehlen et al., \n2007). In total, this model study predicts a decrease in CaCO3 produced by marine organisms under highly increased CO2 conditions. Gehlen, M. R. Gangst\u00f8, B. \nSchneider, L. Bopp, O. Aumont, and C.

How \ncan we check whether the feedback processes really work and \nwhere are the most sensitive regions, which may hold surprises? \nHow large are the feedbacks in relation to mitigation options \nand emission reduction plans \u2013 do we have to revise emission \nreduction policies?\nWe use the latest European coupled carbon cycle climate mod-\nels in order to make the best possible prediction of the CO2 \nairborne fraction in the future. These predictions are based on \nthe sources and sinks of CO2 estimated by the ocean modules, \nbut also the terrestrial fluxes estimated by the land modules. \nFor year 2000, the coupled models result in a global oceanic \nnet sink for anthropogenic carbon of around 2.3 GtC\/yr. We \nconsider the time frame until year 2100 (\u201cIPCC time frame\u201d) \nand 100 years beyond, until 2200.  We are carrying out fully \ncoupled climate\/ocean carbon cycle simulations using realistic \nscenarios for future anthropogenic CO2 emissions, including new \nprocess knowledge on biogeochemical feedbacks. These simula-\ntions will give the most realistic estimates of future transient \nCO2 source-sink distributions currently available. The largest in-\ncrease of the anthropogenic CO2 build up in the atmosphere has \noccurred over the past few years and the rate of CO2 emissions \nis expected to continue to increase (Raupach et al., 2007). \nChanges in the greenhouse effect and climate evolution in the \ncoming decades and centuries will critically depend on human \naction with respect to emissions. The purpose of the predic-\ntive model runs in estimating the repartitioning of carbon, in \nthe coming decades and centuries until 2200, is to make best \npossible projections of: the overall airborne fraction of CO2 (the \nratio of the annual increase in atmospheric CO2 to the combined \nannual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement manu-\nfacture combined). To achieve this the model must predict the \nevolution of the oceanic uptake kinetics, taking into account all \nclimatic and environmental changes in an integrated way, in-\ncluding modelling how the oceanic carbon sink depends on the \ncarbon fluxes to and from the land biosphere. Such a budgeting \napproach, which is based on best possible process knowledge, \ncan only be carried out with prognostic models. These are mod-\nels whose framework of mathematical equations can be reliably \nintegrated forward in time on the basis of given initial con-\nditions. As it is difficult to consider regional carbon budgets, \nbecause one would have to know all carbon fluxes at all open \nboundaries, such a modelling approach can only be based on \nglobal Earth system models (coupled ocean-atmosphere climate \nmodels, that include biogeochemical modules for ocean and \nland biogeochemistry). Within CarboOcean-IP, modelling future \nscenarios using Earth system models is an important synthesis-\ning tool, where the results from the data collection, the process \ndetermination, and the model performance assessment can all \nbe brought together to make realistic forecasts for a given set \nof CO2 emission scenarios. \nFriedlingstein et al. (2006) published an intercomparison of 11 \nEarth system models (general circulation models and coupled \nmodels of intermediate complexity) for carbon fluxes, land-\natmosphere as well as ocean-atmosphere, for the A2 SRES IPCC \nemission scenario (IPCC, 2000) until year 2100 (C4MIP project). \nThe models revealed a broad range of different time evolutions \nfor the concentration of atmospheric CO2. For the ocean, all \nmodels showed a continuous flux of excess CO2 into the ocean. \nHowever, this flux decreased as the prevailing CO2 concentra-\ntion in the atmosphere increased (with the exception of one \nmodel). This implies that the oceans will continue to act as a \nCO2 sink; however, the uptake per additional unit of CO2 emitted \nwill slow down. The result will be an accelerating rate of CO2 \nbuild up in the atmosphere. The reason for this change has still \nto be analysed in detail. The land uptake predicted by many of \nthe models declined to possibly zero in year 2100, while some \nmodels even predict that the land will become a CO2 source to \nthe atmosphere after initially acting as an increasing sink due \nto CO2 fertilisation of the land biosphere.\nIn CarboOcean-IP, we chose five model systems to further ana-\nlyse the ocean\u2019s role in future CO2 uptake (model systems COS-\nMOS\/Max Planck Institute of Meteorology, IPSL-LSCE, Hadley \nCentre, CCSM NCAR\/Bern, BCM). These five model systems in-\nclude several new developments: for example, in the Bergen \nClimate Model BCM, the biogeochemical ocean model HAMOCC \n(Maier-Reimer et al., 2005) was implemented and converted to \ncommunicate with the isopycnal ocean model MICOM, resulting \nin a new model type within the interactive carbon cycle climate \nmodels. Further progress beyond the previous state of the art \nwas made through implementation and use of new parameteri-\nsations (such as particle dynamics Gehlen et al., 2006). All the \nEarth system models used show a future reduction in the oce-\nanic sink in response to climate change, but with considerable \ndifferences between the models (Fig. V.24). These differences \ncan be attributed to changes in mixed layer depth, temperature \nchanges, changes in ocean circulation, and related changes in \nbiogeochemical cycling of carbon, nutrients, and oxygen. In ad-\ndition to analysis of the reaction of the CO2 airborne fraction to \nchanges in climate and oceanic biogeochemical feedbacks, the \nocean acidification due to marine CO2 uptake was also studied.\nCarboOcean-IP includes an analysis of the feasibility of deliber-\nate carbon storage in the ocean. It is by no means the goal of \nCarboOcean-IP to explore this as a realistic means of climate \nmitigation; rather our aim is to contribute to the discussion \nwith respect to a few key scientific questions. The two primary \nquestions addressed are: what is the dispersion process when \n104\n2.6 Development of the marine CO2 sink in the future\nanthropogenic CO2 is injected purposefully into the deep-water \ncolumn? How does the injected CO2 spread at a larger scale? \nTo address the first question, we carried out a suite of labora-\ntory experiments with a sophisticated high-pressure tank. The \nresults of these experiments show that injected CO2 can rela-\ntively quickly rise up to shallower layers because of high droplet \nrise rates (droplets without hydrate skin) in the water column \n(Bigalke et al., 2008) (Fig. V.25). Modelling has progressed \nthrough the further development of a process model, now ca-\npable of realistically simulating the spread of directly injected \nCO2 in all three directions and the simulation of the dispersal \nof CO2 into the water column out of a \u201cCO2 lake\u201d on the ocean \nfloor. First studies with a high resolution ocean general circula-\ntion model indicated that the details of the upwelling in the \nSouthern Ocean critically depend on model resolution and that \nsignificant differences for the predicted CO2 injection efficiency \ncan be expected, depending on the resolution used (Lachkar et \nal., 2007).\nFig. V.25: Various technological mitigation options are currently under public \ndebate. One example is \u201cstoring\u201d CO2 on the ocean floor to keep it out of \nthe atmosphere. CarboOcean-IP includes an analysis of the feasibility of such \ndeliberate carbon storage in the ocean to provide a critical quality check on \nthis proposal. The results of these experiments show that injected CO2 can \nrelatively quickly move to shallower water depths layers. This figure is derived \nfrom pressure chamber measurements. It shows the droplet rise rates of liquid \nCO2 versus droplet radius at pressure and temperature conditions inside and \noutside the field of hydrate stability of deliberately injected CO2 (Bigalke \net al., 2008). Droplets without a hydrate skin (triangles) can rise signifi-\ncantly more quickly through the water column than those with a hydrate \nskin (circles). Reprinted with permission from Bigalke, N.

However, climate \nchange and rising CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere \nand ocean will gradually reduce the oceans ability to keep \nup with additional greenhouse gas loads. This will lead \nto a gradual decrease in the sink efficiency of the ocean \nand thus a temporary huge increase in the rate of growth \nof atmospheric CO2. This increase will depend on the future \namount of CO2 emitted, the change in ocean circulation, and \nrelated biogeochemical processes. Climate model runs which \naccount for an interactive carbon cycle show an accelerated \nclimate change as compared with less realistic models which \nare based on physics only.\nRemaining key questions\nThe science of accurate quantification of the physical and \nbiogeochemical feedback processes to future carbon emissions \nis in its infancy. Even the reason for the natural positive \nfeedback of the marine carbon cycle to climate change is \nnot yet clear (glacial-interglacial changes). Prognostic \nEarth system models need to be systematically calibrated \nto measurements from modern and paleo-times in order to \nincrease their accuracy for future predictions. \n106\n2.7 Ocean carbon data syntheses\nFor 3-D deep-section, marine carbon data, the CARINA col-\nlection now includes data and metadata from more than 180 \ncruises. During a recent workshop in Paris (18 \u2013 19 June 2008) \nthe three CARINA research groups (Arctic, Atlantic and Southern \nOcean) completed secondary quality control of the CARINA data \nset. Secondary quality control is an objective process aimed at \nidentifying and quantifying systematic errors in the reported \nvalues. The data biases are then subjectively compared to pre-\ndetermined accuracy limits. Special consideration is given to \nthe fact that some of the regions studied are known to have \nhad real temporal change over the time period covered by the \nvarious cruises (1982-2007). Obviously, one does not want sec-\nondary quality control to \u201cerase\u201d real temporal change. Vari-\nables considered include salinity, oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, \nsilicate, alkalinity, total inorganic carbon, pH, CFC-11, CFC-12 \nand CFC-113. The nature of the quality control procedure is \nsuch that various data recording errors are also identified. The \nParis meeting completed an extraordinary amount of work: pos-\nsible largely because of the internet-based software developed \nspecifically for this task, and both the automated and manual \nmethods developed for the required data comparisons.\nIn spite of the very substantial progress on the CARINA data \nproject, significant work remains. Most of this work must be \ndone sequentially and cannot be distributed. The remaining \ntasks are outlined below, but it is important to note that while \nthese are being completed, scientific investigation using the \ndata has already begun. This is possible because \u201cnearly final\u201d \nversions of the data have already been distributed to the mem-\nbers of the various working groups. In fact, several \u201cnew\u201d sci-\nentific discoveries were made in Paris; perhaps the most notable \nbeing the identification of a very clear pattern of decadal oxy-\ngen change in the deep Greenland-Norwegian Sea.\n2.7 Ocean carbon data syntheses \nFor the surface ocean CO2 partial pressure database, all publicly \navailable data was harmonised and fCO2 (fugacity of CO2) was \nre-computed from the various carbon dioxide parameters when-\never possible. The database contains original data as reported \nby the scientific team leaders, as well as detailed metadata \nfrom the cruise. This database is an ongoing international effort \n(UNESCO\/IOCCP, SOLAS, IMBER) serving the needs of the carbon \ndioxide research community and contains data from approxi-\nmately 1400 cruises (from 1968 until 2007), with a total of 4.5 \nmillion carbon dioxide measurements \u2013 all recomputed to the \nsame standards and available in the same format. \nTwo different oceanic carbon data sets have been compiled dur-\ning CarboOcean-IP. These essential data syntheses provide an \nunprecedented collection of high quality, ocean carbon meas-\nurements for direct analysis and validation of model simula-\ntions against actual data. The two data sets are: an Atlantic 3-D \ncarbon data set (including related tracer data) based on the \noriginal CARINA data set, but with further recent extensions \nand a 2-D surface ocean CO2 partial pressure data set of first-\nlevel, quality-controlled data (i.e., no gridding to the original \ndata was applied). The respective data coverages are shown in \nFigures V.26 and V.27-29.\nRegional groups have now been established to perform a de-\ntailed second-level quality control. The accuracy of the final da-\ntaset will be approximately 5 \u03bcatm. Afterwards the data set will \nbe made available to the community through the CarboOcean-\nIP data portal and a LAS (live access server). The final data \nproduct will be published as a data report and archived at the \nWorld Data Center for carbon dioxide (Carbon Dioxide Informa-\ntion Analysis Center, CDIAC, USA). \nFig. V.26: The CarboOcean-IP database includes not only all the latest data, but also makes older data available to the community.

Each group leader will prepare a list of data corrections to \nbe applied and submit these to the group of R. Key at Princ-\neton University. These corrections will largely be changes to \nquality control flags due to newly discovered data analysis \nproblems and metadata corrections or additions. \n2. Distribution of individual cruise files and metadata from Prin-\nceton to data centres (CCHDO and CDIAC). The CarboOcean-\nIP data portal will echo the CDIAC holdings.\n3. Each group leader will prepare a table of secondary quality \ncontrol adjustments (as decided in Paris) which exceed the \npredetermined \u201cminimum bias\u201d for each parameter tested. \n4. Princeton will build a merged data product for each region \nin which these secondary quality control adjustments are \napplied. The values of commonly used calculated variables \n(potential temperature, potential density, neutral density, \napparent oxygen utilization) will be added, and the missing \nvalues for salinity, oxygen and nutrients approximated (us-\ning the GLODAP procedures). The approximate accuracy of \nthese data products will be: Salinity - 0.003; Oxygen - 1%; \nNutrients - 2%; Alkalinity 6 \u03bcmole kg-1; Total inorganic car-\nbon 4 \u03bcmole kg-1. For some parameters on some cruises the \nmeasurement precision will not allow the accuracy to be this \ngood. The decision to include or exclude noisy data was made \nindividually for each parameter on each cruise. Within limits, \nnoisy data was retained if it filled an important spatial data \ngap or temporal data gap (for rapidly changing regions). \n5. Princeton will submit the data products to CDIAC (echoed by \nCarboOcean-IP data portal), where it will be available in the \npublic domain.\nParticipants at the Paris meeting decided to submit a series \nof data papers describing the details of the CARINA collection \nand secondary quality control procedures. These papers will give \ncredit to all those who actively participated in the procedure. \nDepending on journal constraints, there will be no fewer than \nthree papers (one for each region) but probably no more than \ntwelve. These publications will serve the same purpose as the \nNumerical Data Packages (NDP) printed by CDIAC for GLODAP. A \nfinal summary publication, similar to that produced for GLODAP, \nwill be submitted to Global Biogeochemical Cycles. Correct ref-\nerence to the data sets will be via one or more of these papers. \nThese papers will be listed at CDIAC as the proper citations for \nthe data. In practice, experience has shown that regardless of \nwhat we do, many outside users will simply reference the web \nsite from which the data is downloaded.\nFig. V.27: Data coverage for Atlantic Ocean deep carbon section data. \n(Source: B.

CarboOcean-IP is well interconnected \nwith other integrated projects and networks of excellence such \nas EPOCA, MERSEA, SESAME, and EUR-OCEANS. CarboOcean-IP \nscientific expertise contributes to guardrails for global change \npolicy: several scientists from the CarboOcean-IP consortium \nwere involved as lead authors in the 4th IPCC assessment report \nof Working Group I (The Physical Basis). \n2.8 International collaboration\nCarboOcean-IP has built up worldwide links to a series of other \nkey projects on carbon cycle research. These links are highly \nimportant because they ensure a seamless feeding of Europe-\nan derived data sets and model developments into the pool of \ninternationally collected data and other model systems. Data \ncollection, particularly in remote areas such as the Southern \nOcean, and the development of advanced state-of-the-art Earth \nsystem models require large teams of people and carry heavy \neconomical and logistical overheads. Carbon cycle research is \nthus expensive and the community from a single country, or \neven one continent, cannot hope to cover all aspects of the re-\nsearch when working alone. Such research will only be successful \nif steered by international coordination and carried out through \nsynergistic collaboration. Recognising this, CarboOcean-IP pro-\nvides the added value of European-wide integration of research \nactivities and results, within the framework of the international \nresearch agenda. \nCarboOcean-IP has been very successful in linking and embed-\nding its work into the international community. This has been \naccomplished on different levels. First of all, the project con-\nsortium itself covers a broad range of expert communities from \nEurope, Morocco, and North America. Princeton University is a \ncontractor to CarboOcean-IP and is participating as an extreme-\nly active collaborator, especially in the field of data synthesis. \nThe project\u2019s international advisory board includes marine car-\nbon experts from the US, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Aus-\ntralia covering a broad spectrum of disciplines. Further, IOCCP \n(UNESCO), the International Ocean Carbon Coordination Project, \nis a project contractor that provides an invaluable link between \nCarboOcean-IP and other key projects, ensuring a smooth and \nopen communication between the various projects worldwide. \nAfter the start of CarboOcean-IP a number of additional associ-\nate partners have entered the consortium (among others are \nthose from Hawaii, Ireland, Switzerland, and Canada).\nCarboOcean-IP cultivates the links to the US Ocean Carbon & Bi-\nogeochemistry programme and the international Global Carbon \nProject (ESSP). CarboOcean-IP is endorsed by the three IGBP \ncore projects SOLAS, IMBER, and LOICZ. CarboOcean-IP results \nare disseminated and shared with other scientists through the \nparticipation of CarboOcean-IP scientists in key international \nconferences such as those organised by the AGU (American \nGeophysical Union), ASLO (American Society for Limnology and \nOceanography), and EGU (European Geosciences  Union) often \nwith their own CarboOcean-IP-related sessions.\n109\n2.9 Training, Dissemination, and Outreach\n2.9 Training, dissemination, and outreach\nCarboOcean-IP has carried out extensive training, dissemina-\ntion, and outreach on a series of levels. The training programme \nincludes education of 25 PhD students; summer schools are or-\nganised for them, which also are open to non-CarboOcean-IP \nPhD students (\u201cMeasurement methods for the carbon system \nand related tracers in sea water\u201d, 2005, Vigo, Spain; \u201cModelling \nof the marine carbon cycle from small to global scale\u201d, 2006, \nBergen, Norway; \u201cCombining data and models - statistical anal-\nysis and data assimilation\u201d, 2007, Kiel, Germany). Special care \nhas been given to include PhD students\u2019 talks in CarboOcean-\nIP plenary sessions at the annual meetings. In addition, there \nhave been PhD student poster sessions and other events at \nCarboOcean-IP annual meetings where students present and \ndiscuss their own research. Each PhD student has a homepage \nwhich is part of the CarboOcean-IP training website. An ad-\nditional training session is planned to help young researchers \ncommunicate their research results to the general public, in \nparticular to schools. This will take place at the CarboOcean-\nIP annual meeting in 2008. CarboOcean-IP has seen the need \nto increase the numbers of female scientists in the field and \nhas included mentoring sessions for female PhD students at \nCarboOcean-IP summer schools and has invited gender experts \nto plenary lectures and discussions at CarboOcean-IP annual \nmeetings and Gender Panel meetings.\nDissemination of CarboOcean-IP results is carried out through \nthe comprehensive website http:\/\/www.carboocean.org, (in-\ncluding a project summary in 17 languages), publications in \npeer reviewed journals, and an active programme of presenta-\ntions at international conferences and meetings, both as post-\ners and oral presentations. The conferences include the regular \nmeetings organised by ASLO, AGU, and EGU, but also other con-\nferences such as OCEANS 07, EurOcean 2007, Oceanology In-\nternational 2008 (Fig. V.30a), 7th International Carbon Dioxide \nConference, Open Science Conference on the GHG cycle in the \nNorthern Hemisphere, and the US Ocean Carbon Biogeochem-\nistry Workshops (OCB). CarboOcean-IP scientists have given \nseveral keynote talks and organised special CarboOcean-IP ses-\nsions at international conferences, such as the EGU (\u201cReduc-\ning uncertainties in the quantification of the oceanic sink for \nanthropogenic carbon\u201d, \u201cBiogeochemistry of coastal seas and \ncontinental shelves\u201d etc., Fig. V.30b).\nPublications in peer-reviewed journals include those in transdis-\nciplinary, high-impact journals such as Nature and Science, as \nwell as more specialised journals such as the new European \nopen-access journal Biogeosciences. The citations for these \npublications have been publicly listed on the CarboOcean-IP \nhomepage, through which selected papers can also be accessed \ndirectly. Publications in newsletters, such as those of SOLAS \nand IMBER, DGM-Mitteilungen and QED, spread CarboOcean-IP \nresults to a wider community within the geosciences and to glo-\nbal change research communities in general. Vertical dissemina-\ntion to other stakeholders includes articles in The Parliament \nMagazine, META, and KLIMA. In early summer 2008, after the \nthird of the five project years, the number of publications which \nwere built on CarboOcean-IP work had already amounted 175.\nFig. V.30a: CarboOcean-IP presented its latest science at Oceanology 2007 \n(at the stand of the European Commission to the left) and \nFig. V.30b: at the EGU 2008 in Vienna (CarboOcean-IP press conference to the \nright).

F\u00e6r\u00f8vik and the scientists\/\ntechnicians E. Falck, S. Kringstad, I. Skjelvan, A. Vol-\nbers\nDuring the school year 2006-2007 17 year-old stu-\ndents, teachers from Bergen Katdralskole (an upper \nsecondary school in Bergen) and scientists\/technicians \nfrom the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research (BCCR) \nwere involved in the project, which was part of a sub-\nject called \u201cScience\u201d. From August 2006 and onwards, \nthere was a special focus on hands-on experiments, \nallowing the students to use all the scientific instru-\nments and to perform all measurements themselves. \nThe students took part in four science expeditions with \nR\/V Hans Bratstr\u00f8m to explore the fjords in their local \narea outside Bergen. \nThe expeditions investigated physical, chemical, and \nbiological aspects of seawater. R\/V Hans Brattstr\u00f8m \nwas equipped with a plankton net, seabed grabsam-\npling equipment, a water sampler unit and a sensor for \nhydrographic measurements (CTD). The students deter-\nmined temperature and salinity as functions of depth; \nthey collected water samples for oxygen and inorganic \ncarbon measurements, and determined the composi-\ntion of the plankton species that could be found at \nthat time of year.\nThe students did seabed grab-sampling surveys and \ncompared the species found on the seabed at two lo-\ncations. To analyse the inorganic carbon samples, five \nof the students visited the BCCR and used the labora-\ntories\u2019 equipment under the guidance of an engineer. \nThe students\u2019 collected all relevant data, analysed the \ndata and wrote a report from the work on board. The \nreport included pictures of all relevant equipment. The \ncruises resulted in substantial reports, and some of \nthe students made a poster which was presented at \nseveral international scientific meetings. In addition a \nnewspaper article and a video were produced from the \ncruise in 2006.\nThis cooperation also motivated the school to focus on \nclimate change issues by arranging a \u201cclimate week\u201d \nat school which consisted of scientific presentations, \npanel debates, etc. During the school year 2008-2009, \nthe successful Norwegian CarboSchools project has \nbeen extended to include two more schools in Ber-\ngen (Bj\u00f8rgvin videreg\u00e5ende skole and Danielsen vide-\nreg\u00e5ende skole). \nFig. V.33: R\/V Hans Bratstr\u00f8m\nFig. V.34: Students, teachers and scientists go onboard and prepare for the \ncruise. \nFig. V.35: Oxygen analyses (Winkler titration)\nFig. V.36: Demonstration of a calibration tank for oxygen sensors\n113\n3    Implications for policy and future research:\n3.1 Achievements and current status of policy\n3 Implications for policy and future research:\n3.1 Achievements and current status of policy\nMarine carbon cycle research has a direct relevance for climate \nand global change policy as it addresses directly the question \nof the timing and amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth\u2019s at-\nmosphere and hence the global warming which occurs as a con-\nsequence. The implications, however, go further than that. In \na more general sense, climate is a key boundary condition for \nhuman life on Earth. All questions of economic development \n(including \u201csustainable development\u201d), health, food, poverty \nelimination, and social equity are linked to this.\nMore specifically, marine carbon cycle research is of immediate \nrelevance to the following issues and to answering the respec-\ntive key questions of societal relevance:\n(1) Informed decisions on energy production and consumption \nneed the best available knowledge on marine CO2 uptake \nkinetics. How quickly does the ocean buffer CO2 from the \natmosphere? \n(2) The variability in the ocean carbon sink needs to be quanti-\nfied continuously: Is the marine carbon sink working as we \nexpect it to? Are the postulated feedback mechanisms at \nwork?\n(3) The difficult-to-establish, but critical, CO2 flux between land \nand atmosphere needs to be constrained by including the \neffect of the oceanic carbon sink. What is the balance be-\ntween net emissions from Europe versus those from North \nAmerica?\n(4) The longer-term timing of the oceanic carbon sink needs \nto be understood. How will the ability of the ocean to take \nup carbon change as atmospheric CO2 levels rise and what \nis the optimal emission pathway? Will there be a slowing \ndown of the oceanic marine overturning circulation and \nwhat consequences will this have for the efficiency of car-\nbon removal from the surface layer?\n(5) The long-term effects of human-made CO2 emissions on the \nocean need to be understood. What levels of atmospheric \nCO2 concentrations will eventually result after the cessation \nof the human CO2 invasion into the Earth system?\n(6) The key impact on marine ecosystems needs to be accurately \nestablished through high quality measurements.  How will \nthe pH value change in various domains and depth levels \nof the marine environment and what will be the impact \non marine biogeochemistry and marine life? What will be \nthe impact in the most critical high latitude regions of the \nSouthern Ocean and Arctic Ocean?\n(7) The growing number of highly controversial mitigation \ntechnological options for greenhouse gas geo-engineering \n(such as artificial ocean fertilisation) need to be critically \nevaluated. What is the scientific foundation for banning \npotentially useless or harmful mitigation options? \nCarbon cycle research is thus essential for resolving major is-\nsues on environmental protection and governance of the sea \nand for establishing its role in the sustainable management of \nthe planet.\nAltogether, this effort can only be carried out with strong in-\nternational collaboration on marine carbon measurements. Eu-\nropean research on greenhouse gas budgets must continue to \nplay its part; a balanced world view is needed. This issue will \nbecome even more important as the global map of greenhouse \ngas emissions changes in response to political and macro-eco-\nnomic developments. \nMarine carbon cycle research is essential for providing the sci-\nentific foundation for decisions linked to the following policy \ndocuments and beyond (links can be found at the end of the \ndocument under \u201cFurther Reading):\nThe European Sustainable Development Strategy 2001: \nhttp:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/environment\/eussd\/\n(\u201cGothenburg strategy of 2001\u201d)\nEU Lisbon strategy 2000, aiming specifically for economic as \nwell as social and environmental renewal: \nhttp:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/growthandjobs\/faqs\/background\/index_\nen.htm\nCommunication \u201cLimiting Global Climate Change to 2\u00b0 Celsius: \nThe way ahead for 2020 and beyond\u201d: \nhttp:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/LexUriServ\/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX: \n52007DC0002:EN:NOT\nThe EU Water Framework Directive: \nhttp:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/environment\/water\/water-framework\/in-\ndex_en.html\nGalway Declaration on Europe\u2019s Oceans \u2013 EUROCEAN 2004:\nhttp:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/research\/press\/2007\/maritime-briefing\/\npdf\/24-galway-declaration_en.pdf\nAberdeen declaration \u2013 EUROCEAN 2007: \nhttp:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/maritimeaffairs\/pdf\/Aberdeen_Declara-\ntion_final_2007.pdf\n114\n3.1 Achievements and current status of policy\n3.2 International Perspective\n3.2 International Perspective\nPatricio Bernal is the Assistant Director-General of the Unit-\ned Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization \n(UNESCO) and Executive Secretary of the Intergovernmental \nOceanographic Commission. The IOC was established in 1960 to \nprovide Member States of the United Nations with an essential \nmechanism for global cooperation in the study of the ocean. \nIn 1957, Roger Revelle and Hans Suess published a seminal \npaper highlighting the role of the ocean carbon cycle in climate \nchange.  In 1960, Revelle helped to establish the IOC, empha-\nsising the need for international cooperation in the study of \nthe ocean carbon cycle. The IOC has implemented ocean carbon \ncoordination activities for over 30 years, including the Com-\nmittee on Climate Change and the Oceans, the CO2 Advisory \nPanel, the International Ocean Carbon Coordination Project and \nthe Ocean in a High CO2 World Symposium series. \u2018CarboOcean-\nIP provides a critical research and monitoring component for \nIOC\u2019s work in developing the global ocean \/ climate observ-\ning system in support of the UN Framework Convention on Cli-\nmate Change\u2019, Bernal explained.  \u2018Without strong national pro-\ngrammes and regional networks, developing a global observing \nsystem would simply not be possible. As an intergovernmental \ninstitution, we particularly appreciate CarboOcean-IP\u2019s efforts \nto develop information and data products that are relevant for \ndecision-makers. This is an often overlooked but essential part \nof scientific research, especially when dealing with large-scale \nor global phenomena such as climate change. UNESCO\u2019s Climate \nChange Task Force has also been very impressed with the range \nof educational activities developed through the CarboSchools \nprogram, and we are working to adapt this approach to apply to \nseveral of UNESCO\u2019s climate education programmes.\u2019\nEU Maritime Policy development, An Integrated Maritime Policy \nfor the European Union (\u201cblue book\u201d):\nIn English: http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/maritimeaffairs\/pdf\/imp-vision \n-paper\/Vision_Paper_en.pdf\nOther languages to be chosen from: http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/mari-\ntimeaffairs\/publications_en.html\n1992 OSPAR convention as current instrument guiding interna-\ntional cooperation on the protection of the marine environment \nof the North-East Atlantic: \nhttp:\/\/www.ospar.org\/eng\/html\/welcome.html\n1992 Helsinki convention signed by all the countries bordering \non the Baltic Sea and by the European Economic Community:\nhttp:\/\/www.helcom.fi\/Convention\/en_GB\/convention\/\nLondon convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by \nDumping of Wastes and Other Matter\n(1972 and 1996 Protocol Thereto), including amendment about \nsequestration of CO2: \nhttp:\/\/www.imo.org\/Conventions\/contents.asp?topic_id=258& \ndoc_id=681\n\u201cBrundlandt report\u201d, Our Common Future, 1987, World Com-\nmission on Environment and Development, Oxford University \nPress.\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change:\nhttp:\/\/unfccc.int\/2860.php\nKyoto protocol to the United Nations Framework on Climate \nChange: \nhttp:\/\/unfccc.int\/resource\/docs\/convkp\/kpeng.html\n115\n3.2 International Perspective\nRik Wanninkhof is an oceanographer at the Atlantic Oceano-\ngraphic and Meteorological Laboratory of the National Ocea-\nnographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Miami, \nUSA. His research focuses on sustained observations of car-\nbon inventories and air-sea CO2 fluxes in the world\u2019s oceans. \n\u2018Study of the carbon cycle in the ocean has by nature of its \nsheer magnitude been a collaborative research endeavour,\u2019 said \nWanninkof. \u2018One of the many successes of CarboOcean-IP has \nbeen its active outreach and collaborations with international \npartners. CarboOcean-IP has in many cases been the impetus \nof expansion, by international partners, of its research efforts \nbeyond the geographic boundaries set up by the programme. \nThe successful efforts to combine the extensive datasets of Car-\nboOcean-IP partners with those of US colleagues in the North \nAtlantic and Southern Ocean has led to a global synthesis effort \nand database to estimate air-sea CO2 fluxes and increases in \nsurface ocean CO2 levels.\u2019\n\u2018The Carbon in the North Atlantic (CARINA) effort that was re-\nvived and incorporated into CarboOcean-IP has created global \npartnerships to assess the changing global ocean CO2 invento-\nries. The international collaborations have led to constraints on \nregional air-sea CO2 fluxes such as those in the North Atlantic \nand Southern ocean, and assessment of decadal changes of car-\nbon in the ocean interior, variability in the \u201cnatural\u201d ocean \ncarbon cycle in the deep ocean that was unexpected. [Regional] \nprocess studies advocated within the US Ocean Carbon and Bio-\ngeochemistry (OCB) programme are being coordinated in close \nassociation with efforts in CarboOcean-IP. Of note are the in-\nteractions in coastal studies with exchange of procedures, hy-\npotheses, and unique opportunities to compare and contrast \nwidely different margins. Ocean acidification and its impact on \nocean ecosystems has been an emerging topic in the last years \nwhere US scientists are establishing close research ties with the \nEPOCA project. \n\u2018While EPOCA is a good example of how components of Car-\nboOcean-IP have evolved into independent large efforts, a criti-\ncal concern of international partners is how the substantial in-\nfrastructure and know-how garnered by CarboOcean-IP will be \ncontinued after the end of the effort. Wanninkof concluded, \u2018As \nthis assessment report clearly indicates sustained observations \nof the anthropogenic CO2 perturbation into the ocean, and its \nimpacts and feedbacks have to be continued. Within the USA, \nNOAA in partnership with other federal agencies has initiated \nseveral sustained observational and research efforts in trends \nof atmospheric and oceanic CO2. The problem is too large and \ntoo important to be done by a single nation and we strongly \nencourage similar sustained programmes under auspices of the \nEuropean Union.\u2019\nToshi Saino is Program Director of the Global Warming Observa-\ntional Research Program of JAMSTEC, and a co-chair of the Carbon \nand Climate Section of the Pacific Marine Science Organization \n(PICES). Toshi Saino is also a member of the Joint SOLAS-IMBER \nCarbon Group, and of CarboOcean-IP\u2019s International Advisory \nPanel. He is now planning JAMSTEC\u2019s carbon cycle research for \n2009-2013. \u2018In planning new experiments, CarboOcean-IP is an \nideal example of successful coordinated research for overall as-\nsessment of the oceanic carbon cycle, comprising observations, \nmodelling, and lab and mesocosm-experiments\u2019, Saino said. He \nalso plans to coordinate an international carbon cycle study in \nthe Pacific in collaboration with US OCB, and other Pacific Rim \ncountries\u2019 programmes, taking advantage of PICES framework. \nHe envisages that \u2018It would provide an excellent opportunity \nto draw a true global picture of the carbon cycle if the Pacific \nstudy could get started in parallel with CarboOcean-2\u2019.\n116\n3.3 Research needs\nin the foreseeable future be carried out by research institutions \nand not through routine measurements by national hydrographic \nservices. Research funding must therefore be provided if these \nessential observations are not to stop. \n(2) Predictive models of the ocean carbon cycle must be im-\nproved with better process parameterisations and the mod-\nels\u2019 sensitivity must be calibrated using observed data. This \nmeans that true process representations must be fitted to true \nobservations, so that not only the present state is represented \nwell, but rather \u2013 and most importantly - also changes (first \nderivative with respect to time) and rates of change (second \nderivative with respect to time). Such a model calibration is ab-\nsolutely necessary if we are to identify the correct model sensi-\ntivity. The challenge is to optimise coupled Earth system models \nappropriately against the observed data. At present, it is even \ndifficult to calibrate the component models of the ocean alone \nthrough systematic data assimilation. Coupled models, however, \nproduce their own weather and climate (internal \u201cnatural\u201d vari-\nability) and hence cannot be so easily calibrated through real \nevents (e.g., an El Ni\u00f1o event will in most cases not appear at \nthe same time in an Earth system model as in the real world). \nThe marine databases are often still insufficient to reveal proper \nstatistics against which Earth system models can be calibrated. \nThe research challenge is therefore, to confront ocean carbon \ncycle models with observations in a systematic way, so that \nthe models\u2019 predictive skills are improved. This methodological \nproblem has to be solved urgently in order to narrow down un-\ncertainties in future projections of the carbon cycle. It will be \nfeasible to calibrate a part of the models\u2019 sensitivities through \nconsideration of the seasonal cycle and the glacial\/intergla-\ncial changes in the carbon cycle and to introduce improved \nprocess parameterisations.\nFurther research challenges include the following issues:\n(a) The biological pump in the ocean is strongly coupled to \nnutrient cycling (element cycles of nitrogen, phosphorus, sili-\ncon, micronutrients such as Fe, Zn, etc.) and changes in oceanic \ncirculation. How do the marine nutrient cycles change as a \nconsequence of human activities and climate change? This in-\ncludes the change in methane and nitrous oxide due to changes \nin stratification and biological production. The associated cou-\npled biogeochemical cycles have to be understood using a com-\nmon approach. Changes in the oxygen budget provides crucial \ninformation about the mode of changes in the carbon cycle \n(biospheric versus physical\/chemical cycling). High precision \nmeasurements of carbon, oxygen, and nutrients are needed as a \ntool to help in detecting and diagnosing large scale changes in \noceanic overturning, which cannot easily be measured by physi-\ncal techniques. There are already well established links to the \nIGBP core projects SOLAS, IMBER, and LOICZ, but links to the \ntrace metal core project, GEOTRACES, have to be improved.\n3.3 Research needs\nAny future carbon cycle research strategy must address the fol-\nlowing two main issues: \n(1) Sustained observing systems for essential carbon vari-\nables are a necessary backbone for further research \u2013 these \nobserving systems include diagnostic models to interpolate be-\ntween measurements and to upscale them. \n(2) Optimised prognostic models are needed for predictions \nunder future conditions. The models\u2019 sensitivity and system \ndynamics must be based on process studies and calibrated \nagainst measurements. These calibrated models can then be \nused when no data from measurements are available, especially \nfor future scenarios. \nWith respect to these issues, we can definitely specify the fol-\nlowing knowledge gaps and research needs:\n(1) Ocean carbon observations need to be continued and \nfurther improved\/developed. Highest priority is for the con-\ntinuation of the surface ocean pCO2 observing system using VOS \nlines (Voluntary Observing Ships). Further needs include con-\ntinuation of repeat hydrography (deep sections), time series \nstations, floats\/buoys (carbon and oxygen), technical develop-\nment of sensors and automated measurement systems, and re-\nmote sensing of ground-truthed key variables. \nDiscussions on how to include a defined subset of ocean ob-\nservations in the ICOS project (Integrated Carbon Observing \nSystem, see Page XXX) are underway. ICOS has been submitted \nand negotiated from the terrestrial community as a European \nresearch infrastructure project which will sustain essential car-\nbon cycle measurements. It is not yet clear how such a \u201cruck-\nsack approach\u201d could be applied to ocean observations under \nICOS, but the oceanographers may propose that some ocean-\nobserving infrastructure be included in ICOS (potentially as a \n\u201csub-centre\u201d under ICOS). If ICOS does become operational, the \nearliest start-up date will be 2012. We therefore must find an \nanswer to the question: How to sustain observations for the pe-\nriod between the end of CarboOcean-IP and when ICOS starts in \n2012?\nThe timeframe for the ocean community is as pressing as it is \nfor the terrestrial CarboEurope-IP community. Most EU-funded \nmarine carbon observing systems are supported only until the \nend of 2008 (one year before CarboOcean-IP will end; 2009 is \ndedicated to data evaluation, modelling, and synthesis). They \nend at the same time as CarboEurope-IP will finish. \nAt this critical phase of steeply increasing carbon loads in the \nEarth system, continuing to monitor ocean carbon, and the de-\nvelopment of new automated measurement techniques, should \nbe a high priority. However, it must be stressed that at present \ndeep carbon measurements and time series stations are not in-\ncluded as part of ICOS. These essential measurements will also \n117\n3.3 Research needs\n(b) How to correctly couple the terrestrial and marine carbon \ncycles together? One option is clearly using atmospheric in-\nverse studies to diagnose the land-atmosphere and sea-atmos-\nphere fluxes simultaneously. However, these computations are \ndiagnostic and are not suitable for making future predictions. \nEvolving advanced Earth system models offer further develop-\nment options by including river transport, estuaries, and shelf \nsea systems. \n(c) How to link oceanic carbon cycle models to the economy? \nMarine carbon cycle models rarely include an economic evalua-\ntion component. Here preliminary design work is necessary; the \nessential impact areas have to be defined (e.g. consequences of \nocean acidification), and economically relevant variables have \nto be identified.\n(d) How to further reduce uncertainties in projections? In \ngeneral, our estimates of uncertainties have become more real-\nistic, but somewhat larger as we discover new sources of error. \nTherefore, our original goal of reducing the size of the uncer-\ntainties may have to be modified to first identifying the uncer-\ntainties correctly and comprehensively, and then secondly to \nsystematically reduce them. \nFurther integration of the European and international car-\nbon research community:\nCoordinating carbon cycle research is itself a challenge due to \nthe interdisciplinary nature of the work. A better interdiscipli-\nnary integration is certainly needed if the marine and terres-\ntrial science communities are to understand each other\u2019s work. \nAt this stage, the terrestrial and marine communities are still \nquite separate and to a degree must remain so, if we are to pre-\nvent loss of focus. Nevertheless, as the carbon cycle is a global \nphenomenon crossing over all Earth system reservoir bounda-\nries, a firm link needs to be established and cultivated. The \nlink is required for the exchange of information and the estab-\nlishment of closed carbon budgets. One encouraging initiative \nwas the greenhouse gas conference in Crete 2006, which was \nattended by participants from the three EU Integrated Projects, \nCarboEurope-IP, CarboOcean-IP, and NitroEurope-IP. Unfortu-\nnately it revealed, that it is not always easy for everybody to \ndevelop enthusiasm for wide areas of research, outside their \nown area of specialisation. The COCOS project (COordination ac-\ntion Carbon Observation System, dedicated to linking European \ncarbon data sets with GEO\/GEOSS, kick-off meeting on 21 May \n2008) will be important in fostering the link between the land \nand ocean communities, as was the 5 October 2007 experts\u2019 \nmeeting in Brussels (with attendees from all major European-\nfunded greenhouse gas projects) which showed the potential in \ncross-discipline work. The meeting agreed that we need a con-\ntinuous platform for common interdisciplinary carbon cycle \nresearch in Europe (which is also linked to the other net-\nworks worldwide). How to keep carbon cycle research projects \nin Europe together \u2013 how to keep the emerging network going? \nLinking the larger research projects running in parallel with a \ncommon coordination action or \u201ccommunication action\u201d could \nbe an effective answer. The major research would then be done \nin separate projects tailored to their specific needs. Certain ar-\neas, which are by their nature overarching (such as Earth system \nmodelling), could be approached as separate additional projects \nlinking ocean and land cycles closely together. Fully synchro-\nnous collaborative research projects (same start and end dates) \nfor land and ocean would be a simple and effective way of \nbuilding a seamless cooperation between land and ocean com-\nmunities.\nData management aspects: It is self-evident that no one per-\nson, laboratory or country can produce sufficient data to ad-\ndress the questions we are currently asking (whether the ques-\ntions be European or Global). Logically it follows that we need \nto have all high quality data in the public domain and available \nto all scientists; to be accessible the data must be easily locat-\nable and in an easily usable format. Achieving this will require \nsteady funding, but the total amount is small relative to the \nscientific return.\nCertain sub-sets of carbon cycle related issues are being carried \nout in separate research initiatives (EU or nationally funded), \nfor example the upcoming FP7 collaborative projects on \u201cocean \nacidification\u201d and \u201cimpacts of climate variability and extreme \nevents on terrestrial carbon storage, exchange flows and soil \nfunctioning\u201d. These more specialized research projects cannot \nreplace overall assessments of the terrestrial and oceanic \ncarbon fluxes. For example, the acidification project members \nwould find it impossible to create the measurement network \nfor pH value and carbonate saturation they need themselves; \nthey must rely on cooperation with other projects (in this case \nCarboOcean-IP). The most practical way forward would be with \na project structure in which marine and terrestrial core projects \nprovide the backbone observing system data collection and co-\nordination-communication, while smaller projects provide the \nspecialised research.\nThe link of research-oriented carbon cycle measurements with \nmore service-oriented end-user friendly data products should \nbe enabled through Kopernikus (formerly GMES). The timeframe \nand exact functioning of data transfer from research networks \nto end user interfaces needs better definition. It is hoped that \na part of the operational service of ICOS will be taken over by \nGMES. We are still in transition from research to operational \nobserving systems (examples: ICOS, ARGO) and expect a certain \nsub-set to stay in the research realm.\n118\nOcean carbon cycle research in view of the ocean\u2019s uptake of \nhuman produced carbon dioxide has a long time history rea-\nching back to the pioneering works on marine CO2 buffering \nof Revelle, Bolin, and Eriksson in the late 1950s. The kinetics, \ni.e., the timing of marine uptake of anthropogenic CO2, could \nbe quantitatively estimated in the 1970s with a series of box \nmodels by Siegenthaler, Oeschger, Broecker, and further resear-\nchers. Oceanic carbon cycle research was boosted by detection \nof the glacial\/interglacial CO2 variations from Antarctic ice core \nanalysis and the parallel findings of stable carbon isotope va-\nriations in deep sea sediment cores. First studies on oceanic \nuptake of human-produced CO2 using ocean general circulati-\non models were carried out among others by Maier-Reimer and \nSarmiento in the late 1980s. The international carbon dioxide \nconferences at Bern, Kandersteg, and Hinterzarten revealed the \nimportance of the oceanic carbon sink but also showed that \nmany details on oceanic carbon cycling were not yet known \nwith sufficient detail.\nThe IGBP core project JGOFS (Joint Global Ocean Flux Study, \n1989-2003) was initiated in parallel to WOCE (World Ocean \nCirculation Experiment) in order to determine how the biolo-\ngical carbon pump modulates the CO2 cycling between ocean \nand atmosphere and to better understand the sedimentary re-\ncord of climate change. A series of EU Framework Programme 4 \n(\u201cMAST\u201d) projects were created in order to better quantify the \nvarious biological and physical carbon pathways in the ocean. \nAmong these projects were a series of specifically targeted pro-\njects, such as ASGAMAGE on the process of air-sea gas exchange, \nESCOBA on linking carbon cycling with ocean circulation, and \nCARUSO on the coupled carbon-nutrient cycling in the Southern \nOcean. CANIGO was dedicated specifically to the coupling bet-\nween climate change and carbon cycling in European waters, \nwhile OMEX I and II focused on carbon cycle relevant processes \nat the continental margins. SINOPS closed important gaps in \nour knowledge about the silicon driven biological pump in the \nocean from sea surface to sediments. General ocean carbon cy-\ncle circulation models were intercompared in the FP4 project \nOCMIP (phase 1).  \nThrough these projects a series of new issues emerged and were \naddressed in collaborative research projects also in EU Frame-\nwork Programme 5. The role of the trace metal iron and its \nrole on biological carbon cycling was in detail studied through \nproject IRONAGES. In ORFOIS, the role of changes in marine \nparticle fluxes in the carbon cycle was addressed through a \ncomprehensive modelling approach. The role of ocean circula-\ntion on carbon transport was investigated in projects TRACTOR, \nOCMIP-2, NOCES, and GOSAC. A systematic use of voluntary ob-\nserving ships (VOS) for semi-automatic measurements of surface \nocean CO2 partial pressure, surface air CO2 concentrations, and \nair-sea CO2 fluxes in the North Atlantic was introduced by pro-\nject CAVASSOO. \nAll these efforts provided extremely useful new insight into ma-\nrine carbon cycle processes. In order to merge European efforts \non quantifying the natural and human-induced carbon fluxes, it \nbecame obvious that the expertise and the specific knowledge \nof European research groups on marine carbon cycling needed \nto be integrated for full exploitation of relevant capacities. As \nmarine carbon cycle research has a clear large scale and global \ndimension \u2013 the ocean is linked worldwide through the oceanic \ncirculation and climate \u2013 researchers were as yet not as well \nintegrated as terrestrial communities which operate on a geo-\ngraphically more confined domain. In order to provide the foun-\ndation for a European integrated marine carbon research effort \ncovering all aspects of the problem, a group of 20 key European \nmarine carbon scientists mainly consisting of previous project \ncoordinators met at Amsterdam in June 2002. Subsequently \nan expression of interest (under the name MARCASSA) concer-\nning an integrated project on marine carbon cycle research was \nsubmitted to the European Commission. The essence of this \nproposition was transferred to the FP6 work programme and \nfinally the successful CarboOcean Integrated Project proposal \nwas submitted including participation from the US. The start of \nCarboOcean was a milestone in European carbon cycle research \nas a fragmentation of the European carbon cycle research com-\nmunity could be overcome and all relevant disciplines could be \nunited under one research project.\nFor the 4th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change, 5 lead authors and a series of contributing \nauthors out of the CarboOcean consortium, shaped important \nsections on marine carbon cycling and respective feedback pro-\ncesses. CarboOcean researchers also took care that for the first \ntime ocean acidification through human-produced CO2 uptake \nwas adequately addressed in this report. CarboOcean researchers \nwere key to promoting and realising a new FP7 project on ocean \nacidification (EPOCA) which would have not been possible to \nthe present degree and sophistication without the pre-existing \nCarboOcean Integrated project.\nOn an international basis, CarboOcean was strongly influenti-\nal towards the creation of overseas ocean carbon cycle pro-\ngrammes such as OCB (Ocean Carbon & Biogeochemistry, USA) \nand Pacificarbon (Pacific research communities). The EU FP7 co-\nordination action COCOS will now realise a merging of terrestrial \nand marine carbon cycle observations and their analysis for the \nbenefit of the European GMES and global GEOSS programmes.\nCarboOcean is grateful to the European Commission, in parti-\ncular to Claus Br\u00fcning, Giovanni Angeletti, Anastasios Kentar-\nchos, and Elisabeth Lipiatou for their constructive cooperation \nin order to advance European ocean carbon cycle research to \ninternationally acknowledged top standard.\n3.4 CarboOcean-IP History\n119\n3.5 Further reading, links, etc.\nBooks and articles for reading:\n\u201cBrundlandt report\u201d, 1987, Our Common Future, World Com-\nmission on Environment and Development, Oxford University \nPress.\nBroecker, W.S., 1985, How to build a habitable planet, ELDIGIO \nPRESS, LDGO BOX #2, Palisades, New York 10964, 291 p.\nSchubert R., et al., 2006, The Future Oceans \u2013 Warming Up, Rising \nHigh, Turning Sour, WBGU, Berlin, 110 p., ISBN 3-936191-14-X. \nhttp:\/\/www.wbgu.de\/wbgu_sn2006_en.html\nWebsites with useful information:\nScience:\nCarboOcean-IP website: http:\/\/www.carboocean.org\nCarboSchools, projects for secondary schools: \nhttp:\/\/www.carboschools.org\nCarbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre, US: \nhttp:\/\/cdiac.ornl.gov\/\nThe International Ocean Carbon Coordination Project :\nhttp:\/\/www.ioccp.org\/\nSOLAS: http:\/\/www.uea.ac.uk\/env\/solas\/\nIMBER: http:\/\/www.imber.info\/\nLOICZ: http:\/\/www.loicz.org\/\nGlobal Carbon Project: \nhttp:\/\/www.globalcarbonproject.org\/\nIPCC 4th Assessment Report of Working Group I : \nhttp:\/\/ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu\/wg1\/wg1-report.html\n3.4 Further reading, links, etc.\nPast and running EU projects related to the marine carbon cy-\ncle \nDedicated specifically targeted research projects \u2013 various ap-\nproaches from different directions and different disciplines and \nfor different regions:\nFP4\/MAST: \n 1.

The Global Carbon Project is coordinating \nresearch to develop a complete picture of the global carbon \ncycle, including both the biophysical and the human dimen-\nsions, and associated feedbacks. In fact, CarboEurope-IP and \nCarboOcean-IP could serve as a model of how the global carbon \ncycle should be investigated in different regions of the world. \nThis is essential if we are to explore the full potential of man-\naging carbon sinks and sources across the globe for climate \nmitigation.\nBy initiating these two Integrated Projects, Europe has taken \na global lead in carbon cycle research. As Kevin Noone, the Ex-\necutive Director of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Pro-\ngramme stated: \u201cThese projects are excellent examples of how \nBASIC KNOWLEDGE can be developed and made useful for deci-\nsion support on adaptation and mitigation issues\u201d. This state-\nment emphasises the need for future funding of carbon cycle \nresearch. We do not yet know enough about the basic processes \ncontrolling the carbon cycle; consequently the models lack re-\nalistic representation of these processes. More FUNDAMENTAL-\nCARBON CYCLE RESEARCH is urgently needed before short-term \napplications can be made with confidence.\nThe main findings of CarboEurope-IP and CarboOcean-IP \nwere:\n- forests are a major sink of carbon, but grasslands may even be \nmore effective. This could have serious implications for Euro-\npean agricultural policy, and questions the wisdom of erasing \n\u201cuseless\u201d grassland in favour of croplands growing maize.\n- the terrestrial surface of Europe still is a significant sink, com-\npensating 17% of the fossil fuel emissions. This sink is twice \nthe fossil fuel emission-reduction target of Europe in the Kyo-\nto protocol. If we lose this sink, e.g. by mis-guided changes \nland-use, the fossil fuel reduction targets for 2020 should not \nbe 20% but 40%.\n- it is quite clear that the proposed pace of reduction in fossil \nfuel emissions is much too slow to mitigate climate change \nbefore major impacts appear. A major issue is now whether \nthe feedback from temperature changes in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere, which is by and large shared between North America \nand Europe, will affect the Global hotspot of the marine sink, \nthe formation of deep-waters in the northern North Atlantic.\n- The North Atlantic is an  important, highly variable carbon \nsink of about 200-450 Tg C yr-1, which is equivalent to a total \nof 1\/5 of the carbon emissions of Europe and Eurasia. If this \nsink diminishes, as seen by CarboOcean-IP, this would require \neven faster and more stringent fossil fuel reduction policies \nthan previously thought.\nThe added value of integrated research of the terrestrial and \nmarine environments \nThe overall goal of the research described in this booklet is \nfor policy decisions on climate mitigation and adaptation to \nbe made on the basis of scientific evidence. Because climate \nchange depends on the interactions between land, ocean and \natmosphere \u201cIntegrated\u201d research is needed which transcends \nthe barriers of conventional scientific disciplines. Europe has \ndeclared it will take the global lead in the climate change miti-\ngation and adaptation process, making this type of integrated \nresearch essential for the decision making process. The two \n\u201cIntegrated Projects\u201d, CarboEurope-IP and CarboOcean-IP, one \nfocusing on the terrestrial surface of Europe, the other on the \noceans, are an example of the joined-up thinking that is needed \nif we are to succeed in the battle to avoid dangerous climate \nchange.\nThe real challenge of CarboEurope-IP and CarboOcean-IP was \nto bring marine and terrestrial science closer together, despite \ntheir different methodologies and experimental designs. In the \nIntroduction and in the main reports we have discussed how \nclimate models must integrate the marine and terrestrial ef-\nfects of fossil fuel emissions, the magnitude and distribution \nof sources and sinks governed by biology, physics, as well as \nchemistry, and the human uses of these environments which \nrange from fisheries to deforestation for food or energy crops. \nAs all this knowledge is fully integrated within climate models \nthe uncertainty in their predictions will reduce and the value \nof these predictions to policy and decision makers will become \nprogressively more relevant.\nWhat happens on land in Europe cannot be separated from what \nhappens in the North Atlantic. Conversely, the future role of \nthe North Atlantic in the carbon cycle and as a climate driver \ndepends strongly on the way we manage our land, and on our \nfuture fossil fuel consumption. Soil is an enormous reservoir of \ncarbon, which if we do not manage properly, has the potential \nto become a source of carbon that would dwarf the emissions \nfrom fossil fuel burning. In a very short time, globally about \n1000 times as much carbon could be released from soils than \nis presently emitted from fossil fuels. Thus fossil fuel emissions \nand land-use are largely independent sources of carbon. Their \ncombined effect could be additive, or an increase in one may \nbe compensated by a decrease in the other. Either way, both \nwill affect the processes, which operate in the North Atlantic. A \nslowing down of the North Atlantic three-dimensional circula-\ntion scheme due to enhanced warming and related freshwater \ndelivery would in addition retard the oceanic carbon uptake and \nalso enhance ongoing climatic change in Europe.\n125\nAdded value of integrated research\n- The Southern Ocean sink for anthropogenic CO2 weakened dur-\ning the past two decades, presumably due to decadal climate \nvariability. The trend has to be observed carefully, a challeng-\ning task which needs strong international collaboration and \nthe further development of automated measurement systems. \nDue to its large volume, small changes in the anthropogenic \ncarbon storage of the Southern Ocean can have important im-\nplications for the global atmospheric CO2 concentration. \n- Marine biogeochemical feedbacks have been identified as \nplaying a significant role both in ecosystem processes, particle \nfluxes, and sediment geochemistry, as functions of tempera-\nture, CO2 concentration, and pH value.\n- Future climate projections with coupled carbon-cycle climate \nmodels show a net reinforcing of climate change by carbon \ncycle processes. This effect has to be taken into account when \ndrawing up emission reduction targets for climate change \nmitigation.\n- The North Atlantic mainly acts as a sink for emissions from \nNorth America rather than Europe. The natural sink for Eu-\nropean emissions is located in Siberia. Thus future funding \nstrategies should view the Eurasian region as a whole, and \ndirect funds at developing understanding of the carbon cycle \nat this even larger scale.\nLand and ocean carbon cycles are intimately linked with each \nother as active parts of the Earth\u2019s climate system (Fig. VI.1). \nThe increase in radiative forcing through human-derived car-\nbon emissions is changing the climate system. At this moment \nthe marine and terrestrial carbon cycles are able to partially \ncompensate for the man-made CO2 emissions through carbon \nuptake. In future the land sink may turn into a carbon source \nto the atmosphere due to land-use, land-use change, climatic \nchange and rising atmospheric CO2 levels. Globally averaged, \nthe ocean will always act as sink for CO2 emissions to the at-\nmosphere, but the sink strength may change considerably due \nto climate change, changes in ocean circulation, as well as bio-\ngeochemical feedback processes to warming and increasing CO2 \nlevels. Therefore, the integrated assessment of carbon sources \nand sinks in relation to the climatic feedback is therefore es-\nsential for policymakers. Such an assessment is only possible \nthrough an integrated scientific systems approach as success-\nfully carried out by CarboEurope-IP and CarboOcean-IP.\nNorth America North Atlantic\nSouth America,\nAmazon\nAfrica, Sahara,\nCongo\nSouthern Ocean\nEurope\nNorth Sea\nMediterranean\nSiberia\nRiver loads River loads,dust transport\nAbsorption and deep mixing\nof global emissions\nAbsorption and deep mixing\nof global emissions\nforcing\ncompensation\nIncrease of heat and\nfreshwater delivery\nControl of European climate Heat transfer and northward\nextension of agriculture\nAbsorption and deep mixing\nof North American emissions\nContinental shelf pump and\ndeep Gibraltar outflow Absorption of European emissions\nFig. VI.1: Positive forcing and compensation processes of relevance for the European carbon balance as part of the Earth system.\n126\nVII CarboEurope-IP Appendix\nOrganisation of CarboEurope-IP\nProject coordinator:\nErnst-Detlef Schulze\nMax-Planck-Institute for Biogeochemistry\nP.O.

Rising atmospheric \nconcentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases over the past 200 years \nhave driven substantially global warming, which in turn could trigger the \nrelease to the atmosphere of additional carbon from the oceans and the \nterrestrial ecosystems, thus accelerating climate change. The interactions \nand feedback mechanisms between the climate-earth system and the carbon \ncycle constitute one of the key scienti\u0002c challenges today.\nThe current publication provides a comprehensive assessment of the European \nand North Atlantic carbon balance based on integrated research actions \nunder the 6th Framework Programme for Research. By presenting key scienti\u0002c \n\u0002ndings, their implication for policy and future research needs, the present \nreport provides a framework for future strategies in the \u0002eld of carbon cycle \nresearch and for further discussions on this highly relevant but also complex \nissue, involving scientists, policy makers, and research agencies. \nT902288cov.indd 1 9\/02\/09 9:24:05\n"}
