INTRODUCTION\nWithin the standard model (SM), neutrinos are massless.\nOn the other hand, the current low energy neutrino oscillation\ndata [1, 2, 3] indicate that at least two of the physical left-\nhanded (LH) neutrinos have tiny masses and therefore mix\namong themselves. However, as yet we do not know if the\nneutrinos are Dirac or Majorana. If the neutrinos are assumed\nto be Majorana then the sub-eV neutrino masses can be gen-\nerated through the dimension five operator [4]\nO\u03bd =\n\u03c6\u03c6\u2113\u2113\n\u039b , (1)\nwhere \u039b is the scale of lepton (L) number violation (\u2206L =\n2). The dimension five operator (1) can originate through the\ncelebrated see-saw mechanism.\nIn type-I seesaw models, three right-handed (RH) neutrinos\n(N\u2019s) are added without extending the gauge group of the SM.\nThe canonical seesaw (or type-I seesaw) [5] then gives the\nlight neutrino mass matrix:\nm\u03bd = m\nI\n\u03bd =\u2212mDM\u22121N mTD , (2)\nwhere mD is the Dirac mass matrix of the neutrinos connect-\ning the LH neutrinos (\u03bdL) with the RH neutrinos and MN is\nthe Majorana mass matrix of the RH heavy neutrinos, which\nalso sets the scale of L-number violation (\u039b). The Dirac mass\nterms determine the L-numbers of the RH neutrinos to be\n+1 and hence the Majorana mass of the RH neutrinos vio-\nlates L-number by two units. The decays of the RH neutrinos\nwould then violate L-number and their CP violating out-of-\nequilibrium decay to SM fields can be a natural source of L-\nasymmetry [6] in the early Universe. The CP-violation, which\n\u2217Electronic address: j.mcdonald@lancaster.ac.uk\n\u2020Electronic address: n.sahu@lancaster.ac.uk\n\u2021Electronic address: utpal@prl.res.in\ncomes from the Yukawa couplings that determine the Dirac\nmass mass of neutrinos via the one-loop radiative vertex cor-\nrection, requires at least two RH neutrinos. The masses of the\nRH neutrinos producing the final L-asymmetry then satisfy [7]\n1\n.\nMN \u2265 O(109)GeV . (3)\nIf the corresponding theory of matter is supersymmetric\n(SUSY) then this bound, being dangerously close to the maxi-\nmum reheat temperature, poses a problem. A modest solution\nwas proposed in ref. [9] by introducing an extra singlet heavy\nfermion. However, the model only achieves a reduction of\nabove bound [7] by an order of magnitude.\nIn the type-II seesaw models, on the other hand, SU(2)L\ntriplet Higgses (\u2206\u2019s) are added to the SM gauge group. Ex-\nplicit breaking of the L-number by trilinear couplings of the\ntriplet Higgs scalar then induces a tiny vacuum expectation\nvalue (VEV) of the heavy triplet Higgs scalars [10], generat-\ning a light neutrino mass matrix:\nm\u03bd = m\nII\n\u03bd = f \u00b5\nv2\nM2\u2206\n, (4)\nwhere M\u2206 is the mass of the triplet Higgs scalar \u2206, \u00b5 is the\ncoupling constant with mass dimension 1 for the trilinear term\nwith the triplet Higgs and two standard model Higgs doublets,\nand f is the Yukawa coupling of the triplet Higgs to the light\nleptons. M\u2206 and \u00b5 are of the same order of magnitude and set\nthe scale (\u039b) of L-number violation. v is the VEV of the SM\nHiggs doublet. In these models, the L-asymmetry is generated\nthrough the L-number violating decays of the \u2206 to SM leptons\nand Higgs [11]. The CP-violation, originating from the one-\nloop self-energy correction, requires at least two triplets. The\nscale of L-number violation is determined by M\u2206 and \u00b5 and is\n1 This could be next-to-lightest RH neutrino if flavor leptogenesis is consid-\nered [8].\n2required to be very high. In most cases the scale of L-violation\nin type-II seesaw models is larger than the type-I seesaw mod-\nels [12].\nFrom the above discussion we see that the L-number vi-\nolating scales MN \u223c \u039b in type-I see-saw models or M\u2206 \u223c \u039b\nin type-II seesaw models comes out to be large because the\nsame L-number violation gives rise to both neutrino masses\nand mixings and to the L-asymmetry. While sub-eV neu-\ntrino masses require large values of \u039b, the large values of MN\nand M\u2206 can easily satisfy the out-of-equilibrium decay condi-\ntion, a necessary condition for the generation an L-asymmetry,\nwithout any fine-tuning of the Yukawa couplings. From this\nperspective, these models are attractive. However, they can-\nnot be verified in future colliders since the scale of L-number\nviolation is very high. Alternatives to these models are pro-\nvided by mechanisms which work at the TeV scale, either in\nSUSY extensions of the SM [13] or by introducing an addi-\ntional source of CP violation into the model [14].\nOn the other hand, one could ask if the origin of neutrino\nmasses and leptogenesis is different? It is well-known that\nthere is no one-to-one correspondence between the parame-\nters in the neutrino mass matrix and those involved in lepto-\ngenesis [15]. In particular, in type-I see-saw model with 3 RH\nneutrinos, while 15 parameters enter into leptogenesis, there\nare only 9 parameters: 3 masses, 3 mixing angles and 3 phases\n(one L-number conserving phase called the Dirac phase and\ntwo L-number violating phases called Majorana phases) in\nthe low energy neutrino mass matrix. Obviously there is no\nconnection. Conservatively, if one considers type-I seesaw\nmodel with 2 RH neutrinos for leptogenesis as well as for low\nenergy sub-eV neutrino masses, then the number of parame-\nters in both cases are 9. However, one can show that there is\nno one-to-one correspondence between the Majorana phases\nresponsible for L-number violation in leptogenesis and Ma-\njorana phases in neutrino mass matrix [16]. The connection\nbetween leptogenesis and low energy neutrino mass matrix is\neven worse in case of type-II see-saw models.\nMotivated by the fact that there is no one-to-one correspon-\ndence between leptogenesis and the effective low energy neu-\ntrino mass matrix, we propose a new mechanism of leptogen-\nesis which occurs completely in the singlet sector at the TeV\nscale [17]. As we will show, the origin of neutrino masses is\ndifferent from the origin of L-asymmetry. The L-asymmetry\nthen arises without any B-L violation. We will show that the\nB-L violation required for neutrino masses does not conflict\nwith the leptogenesis. This model is then extended to incor-\nporate a singlet scalar dark matter particle. While the nature\nof dark matter is still a mystery, we will show that the sin-\nglet dark scalar can either be collisionless cold dark matter\n(CCDM) or self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). The stabil-\nity of the dark matter is ensured by a surviving Z2 symmetry\nwhich could be lifted at the Planck scale and thereby allow\nPlanck scale-suppressed decay of the singlet dark scalars to\ne+e\u2212 pairs in the Galactic halo. The most important feature\nof the model is that it predicts a few hundred GeV doubly\ncharged scalar and a long lived singly charged fermion whose\ndecay can be studied at the LHC\/ILC.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II we intro-\nduce a model which simultaneously explains neutrino masses,\nsinglet scalar dark matter and singlet leptogenesis. In section\nIII, the type-II seesaw model of neutrino masses and the via-\nbility of testing it at colliders are discussed. In section IV we\ngive a brief description of singlet leptogenesis, which arises\nfrom a conserved B-L symmetry. Section V is devoted to sin-\nglet scalar dark matter and its Planck scale suppressed decay\nto e+e\u2212 pair in the Galactic halo. In section VI we give a brief\ndescription of collider signatures and section VII concludes.\nII. THE MODEL: SM\u00d7U(1)B\u2212L\nWe extend the SM gauge symmetry with a global U(1)B\u2212L\nsymmetry, which is softly broken at the TeV scale. In addition\nto the quarks, leptons (\u2113) and the usual Higgs doublet \u03c6 of\nthe SM, we introduce two triplet scalars \u03be and \u2206 and a singlet\ncomplex scalar \u03c7. We also introduce two neutral singlet heavy\nscalars Sa,a = 1,2 and a charged fermion \u03b7\u2212. The particle\ncontent of the model and their respective quantum numbers is\ngiven in table (I).\nTABLE I: Fermions and scalars included in the model.\nParticle Content SU(3)C\u00d7SU(2)L\u00d7U(1)Y U(1)B\u2212L\n\u2113 (1,2,-1) -1\ne\u2212R (1,1,-2) -1\n\u03c6 (1,2,1) 0\n\u03be (1,3,2) 2\n\u2206 (1,3,2) 0\n\u03c7 (1,1,0) 0\n\u03b7\u2212L ,\u03b7\n\u2212\nR (1,1,-2) -1\nSa (1,1,0) 0\nIt is then straightforward to write down the Lagrangian in-\nvariant under the SM and the globalU(1)B\u2212L.

(6)\n3As the Universe expands, \u2206 acquires a very small VEV,\n\u3008\u2206\u3009=\u2212\u00b5 v\n2\nM2\u2206\n. (7)\nFor \u00b5 \u223cM\u2206 \u223c 1012 GeV and v = \u3008\u03c6\u3009= 174 GeV one can get\nthe VEV of \u2206 to be a few eV. The singlet scalars S1 and S2\nacquire VEV much below the mass scale of \u2206. They develop\nVEV at a temperature T \u223c 10 TeV. The VEVs of S1 and S2\nare:\n\u3008Sa\u3009=\u2212\u00b5\u03c6a v\n2\nM2Sa\n, a = 1,2 . (8)\nFor \u00b5\u03c6a \u223c MSa \u223c 10 TeV, the VEV of Sa are in the order of\n1 GeV. The singlet scalar \u03c7 does not acquire a VEV. With\na Z2 symmetry under which \u03c7 is odd while all other fields\nare even, \u03c7 becomes a candidate for dark matter [18, 19, 20].\nAs we will see below, the L-asymmetry arises from the L-\nnumber conserving decay of Sa to e\u2212R and \u03b7+L while the neu-\ntrino masses arise from the L-violating interactions produced\nvia a soft breaking interaction of \u03be and \u2206.\nIII. SOFT BREAKING OF B-L SYMMETRY AND\nNEUTRINO MASSES\nThe VEV of \u2206 does not break B-L gauge symmetry since\nit is inert under the U(1)B\u2212L symmetry. This also ensures\nthat B-L is an exact symmetry until it is broken softly at the\nTeV scale. Note that \u03be does not acquire any VEV at the tree\nlevel and hence there are no neutrino masses unless the B-L\nsymmetry is broken. We assume that M\u03be \u226aM\u2206 and that \u03be and\n\u2206 contribute equally to the effective neutrino masses.\nTo generate neutrino masses we need to break the global\nU(1)B\u2212L symmetry without destroying the renormalizability\nof the theory while ensuring that there is no massless Nambu-\nGoldstone boson that can cause conflict with phenomenology.\nThis can be achieved by adding a soft term in the Lagrangian\n(5)\n\u2212L\u2206\u03be = m2s \u2206\u2020\u03be+ h.c. , (9)\nwhere the mass parameter ms is of the order of a few hundred\nGeV. We assume that such a soft term could originate from\ntheories with larger symmetries. However, we will not con-\nsider its origin in this paper. The mixing between \u03be and \u2206 is\nthen parameterized by\ntan2\u03b8 = 2m\n2\ns\nM2\u2206\u2212M2\u03be\n(10)\nSince we have assumed that M\u2206 \u226b M\u03be, the mixing angle is\nsimply\n\u03b8\u2243 m\n2\ns\nM2\u2206\n. (11)\nAs a result the mass eigenstates are:\n\u03be\u2032 = \u03be\u2212\n(\nm2s\nM2\u2206\n)\n\u2206\u2243 \u03be and \u2206\u2032 = \u2206 +\n(\nm2s\nM2\u2206\n)\n\u03be\u2243 \u2206 .

The effective L-number\nviolating Lagrangian is 2:\n\u2212L\u03bd\u2212mass = fi j\u03be\u2113iL\u2113 jL +\u00b5 m\n2\ns\nM2\u2206\n\u03be\u2020\u03c6\u03c6+ fi j m\n2\ns\nM2\u2206\n\u2206\u2113iL\u2113 jL +\u00b5\u2206\u2020\u03c6\u03c6+h.c. .\n(13)\nAfter electroweak symmetry breaking, the field \u03be acquires\nan induced VEV,\n\u3008\u03be\u3009=\u2212\u00b5 v\n2m2s\nM2\u03beM2\u2206\n. (14)\nThis can be verified by minimization of the complete poten-\ntial. The VEVs of \u03be and \u2206 will contribute equally to neutrino\nmasses and thus the neutrino mass matrix, derived from fig.\n(1), is given by\n(m\u03bd)i j =\u2212 fi j\u00b5\nv2m2s\nM2\u03beM2\u2206\n. (15)\nIf we consider the mass scales \u00b5\u223cM\u2206 \u223c 1012 GeV, ms \u223c 100\nGeV and M\u03be \u223c v, a natural choice of the Majorana Yukawa\ncoupling f gives the scale of neutrino masses to be m\u03bd \u223c O (1)\neV, as required by laboratory, atmospheric and solar neutrino\nexperiments. As discussed previously, one of the triplet Higgs\nscalar \u03be could remain very light without any conflict with neu-\ntrino masses or any other phenomenology. Since the mass of \u03be\ncould be in the range of a few hundred GeV, its decay through\nsame sign dilepton can be tested at the LHC or ILC. Thus\nthe proposed type-II seesaw is testable in contrast to the con-\nventional type-II seesaw. We will come back to this point in\nsection VI while discussing collider signatures.\nIV. LEPTON ASYMMETRY FROM CONSERVED B-L\nWe note that the interaction Sa\u03b7\u2212L e+R conserves B-L-\nnumber. Therefore, out-of-equilibrium decay of Sa cannot\n2 We thank Hiroaki Sugiyama for pointing out a typographical mistake in\nequation (13).\n4generate any B-L asymmetry. However, if there is CP-\nviolation in the decay of Sa then it can produce an equal and\nopposite B-L asymmetry between e+R (e\n\u2212\nR ) and \u03b7\u2212L (\u03b7+L ). If\nthese two B-L asymmetries never equilibrate with each other\nbefore the electroweak phase transition then the B-L asym-\nmetry in e\u2212R can be transferred to the left-handed fields in SM,\nwhile keeping an equal and opposite B-L asymmetry in \u03b7+L .\nThe Yukawa couplings of the charged leptons with the SM\nHiggs field will transfer any asymmetry in e\u2212R into an asym-\nmetry in e\u2212L , which will then take part in sphaleron processes\nbefore the electroweak phase transition. Thus the B-L asym-\nmetry in e\u2212R will generate the required baryon asymmetry via\nsphaleron transitions, while the equal and opposite amount\nof B-L asymmetry in \u03b7+L will remain unaffected even after\nthe electroweak phase transition. Eventually this field will\ndecay slowly after the electroweak phase transition, which\ncan generate a small L-asymmetry, but the baryon asymme-\ntry of the universe will not be affected at this time since the\nsphaleron processes are out of thermal equilibrium. Therefore\nthe baryon asymmetry will survive.\nAs the Universe expands, the temperature of the thermal\nbath falls. Below their mass scales the CP violating decay of\nthe heavy singlet scalars Sa,a = 1,2 generate an equal and op-\nposite B-L-asymmetry between e\u2212R (e\n+\nR ) and \u03b7+L (\u03b7\u2212L ) through\nSa \u2192 e\u2212iR + \u03b7+L\n\u2192 e+iR + \u03b7\u2212L .\nThe decay rate can be given as\n\u0393a =\n(h\u2020h)aa\n16pi MSa , (16)\nwhere the masses of \u03b7\u2212L and e\u2212R are small in comparison to the\nmass of Sa. A net CP asymmetry is generated through the in-\nterference of tree-level diagram and the one-loop self-energy\ncorrection diagram involving \u03c6 and \u03c7 as shown in figure (2).\nThe CP-asymmetry in the decay of Sa can be estimated as\nSa S a S b\n\u03c6,\u03c7\n\u03c6, \u03c7    \n R Ree\n\u03b7\n\u03b7+\n+\nL\nL\nFIG. 2: The tree level diagram and the self energy correction diagram\nof Sa which give a net CP violation.\n\u03b5a =\nIm\n[\n(\u00b5\u03c61\u00b5\u2217\u03c62 + \u00b5\u03c71\u00b5\u2217\u03c72)\u2211i hi1h\u2217i2\n]\n8pi2(M2S1 \u2212M2S2)\n[\nMSa\n\u0393a\n]\n.

These interactions will be in equilibrium for all the three\ngenerations of charged leptons below 105 GeV and hence\nthere will be equal amount of eR and eL asymmetry. This B-L\nasymmetry in eL will be converted to the baryon asymmetry\nof the universe before the electroweak phase transition when\nthe sphaleron processes are in thermal equilibrium. An equal\nand opposite amount of B-L asymmetry in \u03b7L will remain un-\naffected by these interactions.\nNote that the generated B-L asymmetry in the left-handed\nsector is not washed out by the L-violating interactions me-\ndiated by \u03be and \u2206 because those processes are suppressed.\nIn particular \u2113\u2113\u2194 \u03c6\u03c6 is suppressed by m2s\/M2\u2206. For ms \u223c 1\n100 GeV and M\u2206 \u223c 1012 GeV the suppression of \u2206L = 2 pro-\ncesses are of the order 10\u221220. However, this asymmetry can be\nwashed out through the decay: \u03b7+R \u2192 \u00af\u2113+ \u03c6, unless the decay\nrate\n\u0393\u03b7 =\n|gi1|2\n16pi M\u03b7 , (18)\nsatisfies \u0393\u22121\u03b7 \u2261 \u03c4\u03b7 > \u03c4EW , where \u03c4EW \u223c 10\u221212s is the time\nof electroweak phase transition. Furthermore, \u03b7+ should be\ndecayed away well before Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)\nin order not to conflict with the prediction of BBN. Therefore\n\u03c4\u03b7 < \u03c4BB \u223c 1s .

Consequently the effective potential\nbefore the electroweak phase transition is given by\nVe f f = m2\u03c6\u03c6\u2020\u03c6+ \u03bb1(\u03c6\u2020\u03c6)2 + m2\u03c7\u03c7\u2020\u03c7\n+ \u03bb2(\u03c7\u2020\u03c7)2 + \u03bb3(\u03c6\u2020\u03c6)(\u03c7\u2020\u03c7) (21)\nwhere\nm2\u03c6 =\n(\nm21 + \u03bba\u3008Sa\u30092 + \u03bb4\u3008\u2206\u30092\n)\nand m2\u03c7 =\n(\nm22 + \u03bbb\u3008Sb\u30092 + \u03bb5\u3008\u2206\u30092\n)\n. (22)\nThe above effective potential is bounded from below if and\nonly if \u03bb1,\u03bb2 > 0 and \u03bb3 >\u22122\n\u221a\n\u03bb1\u03bb2. For m2\u03c6 < 0 and m2\u03c7 > 0,\nthe minimum of the potential is given by\n\u3008\u03c6\u3009=\n(\n0\nv\n)\nand \u3008\u03c7\u3009= 0 . (23)\nThe VEV of \u03c6 gives masses to the SM fermions and gauge\nbosons. The physical mass of the SM Higgs is then given by\nmh =\n\u221a\n4\u03bb1v2. Since \u03c7 is odd under the surviving Z2 symme-\ntry it cannot decay to any of the conventional SM fields and\nhence the \u03c7 can constitute the dark matter component of the\nUniverse.\nA. Cold Dark Matter\nGauge singlet scalars interacting via the renormalisable\n\u03c7\u2020\u03c7\u03c6\u2020\u03c6 coupling to the Higgs doublet can account for cold\ndark matter (CDM) [18, 19, 20]3. For \u03bb3 >\u223c 0.01, the gauge sin-\nglet scalar CDM density is produced via conventional freeze-\nout from thermal equilibrium. For 10GeV <\u223c m\u03c7 tot <\u223c 1TeV and\n0.01 <\u223c \u03bb3 <\u223c 1, the scalar density is naturally of the order of the\nobserved CDM density over a wide region of the (\u03bb3,m\u03c7 tot)\nparameter space [18]. (m\u03c7 tot denotes the physical \u03c7 mass,\nincluding the contribution from the Higgs expectation value,\nm2\u03c7 tot = m\n2\n\u03c7 + \u03bb3 < \u03c6\u2020\u03c6 >.) Such scalars have annihilation\nand nuclear scattering cross-sections which make them a po-\ntentially detectable CDM candidate in cryogenic detectors and\nneutrino telescopes, on a par with more conventional WIMP\ncandidates [18]. They may also be produced at the LHC via\nHiggs decay [18, 20].\nFor small \u03bb3 there is an alternative possibility for gauge sin-\nglet scalar dark matter [19]. If \u03bb3 \u226a 1, gauge singlet scalars in\nthermal equilibrium are unable to annihilate efficiently, result-\ning in too much CDM after freeze-out [23]. In order to evade\nthis problem, \u03bb3 must be sufficiently small that the gauge sin-\nglets never come into thermal equilibrium. Although there is\nno freeze-out thermal relic density in this case, it is still pos-\nsible to produce a CDM density via decay of thermal equilib-\nrium Standard Model particles to \u03c7 pairs, in particular Higgs\ndecay [19]. In this case the density of CDM is given by [19]\n\u2126\u03c7 = 0.3\n( \u03bb3\n2\u00d710\u221210\n)2(115GeV\nmh\n)3(0.7\nh\n)2( m\u03c7 tot\n4.8MeV\n)2\n,\n(24)\nwhere mh is the physical Higgs boson mass and h parameter-\nizes the Hubble constant. Thus \u03bb3 \u2248 10\u221210 is necessary to\naccount for CDM. A particularly interesting possibility is that\n\u03c7 gains its mass mostly from the Higgs expectation value. In\ngeneral m2\u03c7 tot = m2\u03c7 + \u03bb3v2\/2 (v = 174 GeV). Therefore for\nm\u03c7 = 0, the \u03c7 mass is a function only of \u03bb3. In this case the\ndark matter density is entirely determined by m\u03c7 tot and mh\n[19],\n\u2126\u03c7 = 0.3\n(\n115GeV\nmh\n)3(0.7\nh\n)2( m\u03c7 tot\n2.8MeV\n)5\n. (25)\nThus m\u03c7 tot \u2248 3 MeV is predicted for the scalar mass in this\ncase. (Note that this is a rather precise estimate, due to the\nhigh power of m\u03c7 tot in Eq.(25).) As discussed below, this is a\nphysically significant mass scale. Light gauge singlet scalars\nwith masses in the 1-10 MeV range [19, 24] can account for\nself-interacting dark matter (SIDM) [25], whilst the decay of\n1-6 MeV scalars to e+ e\u2212 pairs can account for the 511 keV \u03b3\nline from the galactic center [26, 27, 28] observed by INTE-\nGRAL [29].\nB. Self-Interacting Dark Matter\nSIDM has been suggested as a way to explain the ab-\nsence of peaked galaxy halo profiles and the small number\n3 The notation used in [18, 19] is such that S\u2194 \u03c7, \u03bbS \u2194 \u03bb3, m\u2194 m\u03c7, mS \u2194\nm\u03c7 tot and \u03b7\u2194 4\u03bb2.\n6of sub-halos in galaxies as compared with CDM simulations\n[25]. This requires that the self-interaction cross-section of\nthe dark matter, \u03c3, satisfies r\u03c7 \u2261 \u03c3\/m\u03c7 = (0.45\u22125.6)cm2g\u22121\n[25]. Recently, comparison of the theoretical dynamics of\nthe merging galaxy cluster 1E 0657-56 (the \u2019Bullet cluster\u2019)\nwith observation has placed a new upper bound on this range,\nr\u03c7 <\u223c 1cm2g\u22121 [30]. Nevertheless, a window still remains\nwhere SIDM scalars could have a significant effect on galaxy\nhalos.\nFor a gauge singlet self-interaction \u03bb2|\u03c7|4, the total scatter-\ning cross-section is [19]\n\u03c3 = \u03c3\u03c7\u03c7\u2020\u2192\u03c7\u03c7\u2020 + \u03c3\u03c7\u03c7\u2192\u03c7\u03c7 =\n3\u03bb22\n8pim2\u03c7\n. (26)\nThis self-interaction can modify galaxy halos if the mass is in\nthe range mS = \u03b1\n1\/3\n\u03bb2 (38.8\u221290.1) MeV (with \u03b1\u03bb2 = \u03bb\n2\n2\/4pi),\nwhere the lower bound is the value at which galaxy halos\nwould evaporate due to interaction with hot particles in cluster\nhalos, while the upper bound is the value at which the scalars\ndo not interact within a typical galactic halo during a Hubble\ntime and so have no effect [19, 25]. (The new constraint from\nthe Bullet cluster raises the lower bound to 68.7\u03b11\/3\u03bb2 MeV.) If\nwe consider the magnitude of the \u03c7 self-coupling to be simi-\nlar to the SM Higgs self-coupling, such that \u03bb2 \u2248 0.025, then\nthis mass range is m\u03c7 \u223c 1\u22124 MeV. In this case there is a good\npossibility that light scalar dark matter will have an observable\neffect on galaxy halos.\nC. Decaying \u03c7 Dark Matter and the INTEGRAL 511 keV flux\nIn order to explain the 511 keV \u03b3-ray flux observed by\nINTEGRAL, we need a large number density of dark mat-\nter particles at the center of the galaxy plus low energy\npositrons from their decay in order that the positrons can slow\nto non-relativistic velocities before annihilating with back-\nground electrons. These conditions require that the decaying\nparticles are in the range 1-6 MeV, corresponding to positron\ninjection energies <\u223c 3 MeV [28], in good agreement with\nm\u03c7 \u2248 3 MeV. For an interaction of the form \u03c7meee\/M\u2217, the\n\u03b3 flux relative to the experimentally observed flux is [27]\n\u03a6\n\u03a6exp\n\u2248 25\n(\n1019GeV\nM\u2217\n)2( \u2126\u03c7\n0.23\n)\n, (27)\nwhere the dominant decay mode is assumed to be \u03c7 \u2192 e+e\u2212\nwith decay rate\n\u0393\u03c7\u2192e+e\u2212 =\nm2em\u03c7\n8piM2\u2217\n. (28)\nThus with a Planck-suppressed decay rate, light gauge singlet\nscalars of mass m\u03c7 \u2248 3 MeV can account for the observed 511\nkeV flux.\nThe above decay: \u03c7\u2192 e+e\u2212 can be realized if we allow Z2\nto be violated at the Planck scale. We have then the allowed\nPlanck scale suppressed Lagrangian\nL = y\n\u03c7\u03c6 \u00af\u2113eR\nMPl\n+ f \u03c7\u03be\u2113\u2113\nMPl\n+ f\n\u03c7(m2s\/M2\u03be)\u2206\u2113\u2113\nMPl\n+g\n\u03c7 \u00af\u2113\u03c6\u03b7\u2212R\nMPl\n+ h \u03c7S\u03b7\n\u2212\nL e\n+\nR\nMPl\n+ \u02c6h\u03c7\u03b7\u2212L e+R + h.c. . (29)\nSince m\u03c7 \u226aM\u03b7, the decay modes: \u03c7\u2192 \u03b7\u2212L e+R and \u03c7\u2192 \u00af\u2113\u03c6\u03b7\u2212R ,\nS\u03b7\u2212L e+R are forbidden. Thus the relevant effective Z2 violating\nLagrangian is given as:\nL =\nme\nMPl\n\u03c7e\u00afLeR + f \u2032\u03c7\u2113\u2113+ f \u2032(m2s\/M2\u03be)\u03c7\u2113\u2113+ h.c. , (30)\nwhere f \u2032 \u2261 f \u2032(\u3008\u2206\u3009\/MPl)\u2264 10\u221226. Therefore, the contribution\nof the second and third terms are negligible to the observed\n\u03b3-ray flux while the first term is in the right ballpark.\nVI. SIGNATURES OF \u03be\u00b1\u00b1 AND \u03b7\u00b1\nThe doubly charged component of the light triplet Higgs\n\u03be can be observed through its decay into same sign dilep-\ntons [31]. Since M\u2206 \u226b M\u03be, the production of \u2206 particles in\ncomparison to \u03be is highly suppressed. Hence it is worth look-\ning for the signature of \u03be\u00b1\u00b1 either at LHC or ILC. From Eq.\n(13) one can see that the decay \u03be\u00b1\u00b1\u2192 \u03c6\u00b1\u03c6\u00b1 are suppressed\nsince the decay rate involves the factor m\n2\ns\nM2\u2206\n\u223c 10\u221220. While\nthe decay mode \u03be\u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 h\u00b1W\u00b1 is phase space suppressed,\nthe decay mode \u03be\u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 W\u00b1W\u00b1 is suppressed because the\nVEV of \u03be is small as required for sub-eV neutrino masses and\nto maintain the \u03c1 parameter of SM to be unity. Therefore,\nonce produced, \u03be mostly decays through same sign dileptons:\n\u03be\u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 \u2113\u00b1\u2113\u00b1. Note that the doubly charged particles cannot\ncouple to quarks. Therefore the SM background of the pro-\ncess \u03be\u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 \u2113\u00b1\u2113\u00b1 is quite clean and so the detection will be\nunmistakable. From Eq. (13) the decay rate of the process\n\u03be\u00b1\u00b1\u2192 \u2113\u00b1\u2113\u00b1 is given by\n\u0393ii =\n| fii|2\n8pi M\u03be++ and \u0393i j =\n| fi j|2\n4pi\nM\u03be++ , (31)\nwhere the fi j are highly constrained by lepton flavor violating\ndecays. Therefore if a doubly charged scalar can be detected\nin the future, the neutrino mass patterns can be probed at a\ncollider [32] 4.\nSince the mass of \u03b7\u2212 is a few hundred GeV, the decay\n\u03b7\u2212\u2192 he\u2212 can be observed in future colliders (LHC\/ILC). On\nthe other hand, \u03b7\u2212 can also be produced in high energy neu-\ntrino collisions with matter through \u03bdLe\u2212R \u2192 \u03bdL\u03b7\u2212R . Since it\nis long-lived, it can travel large distances and be detected in\nneutrino telescopes [34] 5.\n4 There has been recent interest in detecting neutrino mass parameters at\ncolliders [33]. These references appeared on arXiv after our paper.\n5 We thank John F. Beacom for bringing this to our notice.\n7VII. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have introduced a new leptogenesis mechanism in a\nU(1)B\u2212L extension of the SM which allowed us to explain si-\nmultaneously neutrino masses, dark matter and leptogenesis.\nThe important message is that the L-asymmetry arises without\nany B-L violation. Since the L-number violation required for\nleptogenesis and neutrino masses are different, the leptogene-\nsis scale can be lowered to as low as a few TeV.\nNeutrino masses arise through a modified type-II seesaw\nwhich predicts a few hundred GeV triplet scalar. Note that\nin conventional type-II seesaw models the mass scale of the\ntriplets is required to be at least O(1010) GeV to produce sub-\neV neutrino masses. Since one of the triplets in our model,\nnamely \u03be, has a mass of a few hundred GeV, the proposed\nmodel can be tested in the near future at colliders through\nsame sign dilepton decay of \u03be.\nThe model also predicts a singly charged fermion \u03b7\u2212 of\nmass ranging from 200 GeV to 1 TeV. \u03b7\u2212 can be produced in\nhigh energy neutrino collision with matter. Since it is long-\nlived, it can travel large distances and be observed in neutrino\ntelescopes.\nWe proposed a singlet scalar, \u03c7, with mass \u2248 3 MeV as\na candidate for dark matter, whose stability is ensured by a\nZ2 symmetry. This Z2 discrete symmetry can be broken at\nthe Planck scale. We then showed that a possible origin of\n511 KeV Galactic line detected by INTEGRAL could be the\nPlanck scale-suppressed decay of \u03c7 to e\u2212e+ pairs in the Galac-\ntic halo.\nAcknowledgement\nJM and NS were supported by the European Union through\nthe Marie Curie Research and Training Network \"Uni-\nverseNet\" (MRTN-CT-2006-035863) and by STFC (PPARC)\nGrant PP\/D000394\/1.\n[1] Q.R.
