The emergence of the so-called \u2017anti-\nageing\u2018 movement and the controversies surrounding its promises to extend human longevity \nhave captured the attention of the British and American public, but so have the more sober \nassessments presented in popular books such as Leonard Hayflick\u2018s How and Why We Age \n(1994) and Thomas Kirkwood\u2018s The End of Age: The Science of Human Aging (1999). This \ninterest has motivated both consultations on public attitudes toward research into the causes \nof ageing (Alliance for Aging Research, 2005; MORI, 2006) and political interventions such \nas the White House Conference on Aging (2005) and the House of Lords Report on Ageing \n(2005). These developments have been accompanied by an intensification of research on the \nbiology of ageing, and the therapeutic value of a number of biomolecules characterised \nduring the course of such research is currently being tested in animal and human trials. \nLastly, clinicians would appear to be willing increasingly to provide these and other life-\nextending treatments to older individuals. This entire situation has captured the attention of \nsocial scientists, many of whom refer to the \u2017biomedicalization of aging\u2018.  \n \nEstes and Binney (1989) first coined the phrase \u2017biomedicalization of aging\u2018 as a label for the \nprocesses whereby ageing comes to be defined as a matter of \u2017biomedical\u2018 interest, processes \nwhich would appear today to be intensifying and be increasingly associated with the \nreorganisation of health care around technological intervention and the modes of prevention \nand consumption (Clarke et al., 2003; see also Kaufman et al., 2004). Contemporary \nbiogerontology, a subfield of gerontology that is simultaneously engaged in the biomolecular \nand biodemographic characterisation of the processes associated with the development of the \nindividual from birth to death, presents however a paradox.\n1\n One of its distinctive claims is \nthat it provides an alternative model for understanding those diseases that are commonly \nassociated with advanced age, such as cardio-vascular disease, cancer and dementia. Rather \nthan pursuing the disease-specific model that has been deployed within many other branches \nof the biomedical enterprise, biogerontologists argue that increases in health and longevity \nare more likely to be achieved by focusing research on the common biological basis of all \nthose diseases that would seem to characterise the lives of older people. Furthermore, in \nPage | 2 \n \nreconstructing these diseases as part of a wider set of \u2017degenerative diseases\u2018 that are only \nconnected contingently to the organism\u2018s chronological age, biogerontologists would appear \nto call into question the status of ageing as a biological process. In other words, the \ndevelopment of biogerontology seems to undermine the possibility of any straightforward \nconjunction of biology and medicine which the phrase \u2017biomedicalization of aging\u2018 conjures \nalmost by definition. In drawing attention to this paradox, we follow Keating and Cambrosio \n(2003) and their definition of biomedicine as a set of practices that was established during the \nsecond half of the twentieth century and that has organised the relationship between the \nlaboratory and the clinic by means of hybrid \u2017bio-clinical\u2018 entities. Viewed from this \nperspective, biomedicine is less the systematic application of biological standards and \nproducts in clinical work (Canguilhem, 1991), than it is a set of conventions that are specific \nto work on particular diseases and enable the coordination of bench and bedside within these \nso delimited domains alone. \n \nIn this paper, we articulate this counter-intuitive understanding of biogerontology by first \nexploring the conceptual presuppositions of recent proposals that have emerged from within \nbiogerontology to reorganise not just gerontological research, but biomedical research more \ngenerally. We then offer a genealogy of the situation by turning to the middle decades of the \ntwentieth century, when gerontology first gained institutional recognition and the biology of \nageing was a domain contested between those who argued for a \u2017basic\u2018 approach and those \nwho proposed to focus on the differences between \u2017normal\u2018 and \u2017pathological\u2018 ageing. We \nthen consider how the latter approach came to dominate the organisation of gerontological \nresearch in both the United Kingdom and the United States, but for very different reasons, \nand how it eventually was embedded in the activities of the National Institute of Aging \n(NIA). We then trace how the NIA\u2018s blue-print for research into the causes and treatment of \nageing initiated a transatlantic, biogerontological critique of biomedicine. Our aim is to \nestablish that the development of biogerontology contrasts sharply with the many successful \nrelationships that have been established between the laboratory and the clinic by means of \nmediating, hybrid versions of the \u2017normal\u2018 and the \u2017pathological\u2018. If, as Boltanski and \nTh\u00e9venot (1999) argue, \u2017the less pure a situation is (in the sense that it contains objects from \ndifferent worlds), the easier it is to denounce it\u2018 (374), biogerontology has harnessed the \ninternal tensions of biomedicine, seeking to construct a field of action whereby the historical \nopposition of biomedicine and public health no longer obtains and the laboratory, \npreventative medicine and health maintenance programmes can be integrated seamlessly. In \nPage | 3 \n \nthe concluding section of this paper, we point however towards some important sources of \nuncertainty within the biogerontogical project. \n \nBiogerontology and biomedicine \nIn past decade, the organisation of gerontological research has gained wide political \nrecognition. In the United States, for example, a group of biogerontologists and policy \nmakers who were attending the White House Conference on Aging (2005) have drawn \nattention to the minute proportion of the annual budgetary allocation for the National \nInstitutes of Health that is dedicated to understanding the basic biology of ageing, and have \ncalled on legislators to reconsider the situation because \u2017the aging research field [is] on the \nthreshold of a new way of thinking \u2013 shifting from a focus on specific age related illnesses to \na search for an understanding of aging itself (Alliance for Aging Research, 2005: 4). In the \nUnited Kingdom, the Science and Technology Committee of the House of Lords, has \nadvanced a similar argument, noting that \u2017most of the research on ageing and health ... is \nfocused on specific diseases and medical conditions for which age is the single largest risk \nfactor\u2018 and then bemoaning the paucity of support for much more promising programmes of \nresearch on the \u2017basic processes of ageing\u2018 (House of Lords, 2005: 103). \n  \nThe focal point of these arguments about the current organisation of gerontological research \nand its limitations is the dependence on clinical definitions of those diseases most commonly \nassociated with old age. According to the authors of a position statement on health promotion \nand disease prevention in the twenty-first century (Butler et al., 2008), such dependence is \ntroubling because it is an effect of an anatomical division of the body that was forged in the \nnineteenth century and no longer provides a useful way to understand disease. The clinical \nworldview, these authors maintain, was well-suited to pathologies characterised by discrete \nand specific aetiologies, but is inadequate to address the chronic, long-term illnesses of the \nlate twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The protracted temporal unfolding of these \nillnesses is so nearly coterminous with ageing that it unsettles the epistemic pairing of the \n\u2017normal\u2018 and the \u2017pathological\u2018 that underpins clinical perspective on ageing. Furthermore, \nthis pairing assumes that the two states can be situated proximally and intervened upon \ndirectly, but this obscures understanding of the diverse and complex processes involved in the \ndeclining functional capacities of the organism such that the perspectives of the laboratory \nand clinic must be integrated with programmes of health screening and maintenance. A \nfurther criticism of biomedical research is that, by relying on methodological and \nPage | 4 \n \nepistemological structures that are wholly incommensurable with the phenomenon studied, it \ncannot but fail to deliver effective treatments for those pathological states commonly \nassociated with old age. As the House of Lords (2006a) notes, \u2017generic research into the \nprocess of ageing ... may be \u2017the most direct route to developing novel interventions and \ntherapies\u2016. In sum, the charge is that current organisation of biomedicine may serve many \nclinicians and researchers well, but it fails to secure health and longevity. \n \nAt the same time, the biogerontological critique of biomedicine also aims to redraw the \ncontours of the relationship between the biology, medicine and society. As the following \nextract from an interview with a biogerontologist intimates, what is required is a wholly new \napproach to disease.\n2\n Having been asked about his expertise, this biogerontologist \nforegrounds the issue of normal ageing:  \n[My] scientific interest is to explain the occurrence of age associated diseases. \nSome people call that ageing, some people call that normal ageing, [and] some \npeople say it\u2018s different from normal ageing. I don\u2018t make a distinction between \nthem. \nWhen pressed on the importance attached today to research on the causes of Alzheimer\u2018s \nDisease (AD) as answer to the problems posed by old age, this biogerontologist adds:  \nWhat\u2018s behind, let\u2018s say the senile muscle, is of equal importance ... because \npeople can\u2018t go out any more and they suffer from it. What\u2018s normal? There\u2018s \nnothing like normal ageing. \nWhat is important, according to this biogerontologist, is a historical disjunction between the \ngenome and the environment to which the genome is exposed: \n[We] were not meant to live longer than forty years, and the system is optimised \nin an environment like Africa. But now we don\u2018t live in Africa. ... [Our] life \nhistory is ... the result of ... an old, optimised genome ... now ... exposed under \nmodern, affluent conditions. But it\u2018s not meant to be ... it\u2018s not meant to be \nexposed under these conditions.  \nFrom this perspective, normality is a historically specific discrimination of little biological \nsignificance, at least insofar as biology is equated with attention to the evolutionary dynamics \nshaping the life course of the organism. This argument has gained considerable momentum in \nthe context of what has become known as \u2017evolutionary medicine\u2018 (Nesse & Williams, 1996) \nand encapsulates a more general approach that undermines the long-established recourse to a \ncategorical contrast between normal and pathological states whereby problems that could be \nPage | 5 \n \nregarded as \u2017of equal importance\u2018 are instead organised hierarchically, focusing primarily on \ndisease and ultimately reflecting the organisation of medical specialities and markets. \n \nHow are we to understand this critique of biomedicine which, in many ways, contradicts \nextant analyses of the sciences of ageing? Our thesis is that it is rooted in gerontologists\u2018 \ncomplex and fraught relationship to the enterprise of biomedicine as the latter took shape \nduring the latter half of the twentieth century. Consequently, in what follows, we document \ndiverse attempts to forge some relationship between the biology, medicine and ageing and \nhow these enterprises were ultimately incorporated into a biomedical approach that has \nemphasised the medical pathologies of old age, rather than focussing on ageing as a complex \nbiological phenomenon. To avoid any misunderstanding, we must emphasise at this point that \nwhat we are seeking to offer is a genealogy of the present situation, a \u2017history of the present\u2018, \nrather than any account of origins. \n   \nBetween unity of causes and unity of effects \nBetween the late 1930s and early 1950s, a variety of public and private actors became \ninterested in the biology of ageing. Underpinned by a burgeoning volume of actuarial \nprojections of an \u2017ageing population\u2018 and preoccupation about economic deprivation and \nillness (Haber & Gratton, 1994; Thane, 2000), such interest was not matched however by any \npre-existent, agreed set of epistemic commitments among the variety of actors studying \nageing as a strictly biological phenomenon. Instead, it excited a number of debates over the \ndefinition of ageing which resulted in a diversity of possible answers to the questions posed \nby these public and private actors. Such divergence was particularly evident during the \nconferences supported by two of the most active philanthropic supporters of research on \nageing, the Josiah Macy Foundation in the United States and the Nuffield Foundation in the \nUnited Kingdom. \n \nThe Josiah Macy Foundation was responsible for funding surveys of ageing in the 1930s and \ncommissioning a seminal conference on the biology of ageing at the end of the decade. As \nPark (2008) has documented, Edmund Cowdry\u2018s edition of the published proceedings of this \nconference was riven by disagreement between the various contributors, mostly around the \n\u2017parameters\u2018 and \u2017standards\u2018 by which to contrast normal and pathological ageing. Similarly, \nthe Nuffield Foundation was a key sponsor of ageing research and is renowned for having \nsponsored the Survey Committee on the Problems of Ageing and the Care of People, which \nPage | 6 \n \nbrought the living conditions of older citizens to the attention of the British public (Thane, \n2000). What is less known is Nuffield Foundation\u2018s support for research into the biology of \nageing, which started in 1940 and eventually resulted in an extensive network of laboratories \nacross the United Kingdom. Here too, however, the uncertainties were deep and, when the \nNuffield Foundation sponsored a symposium in 1956 to showcase its achievements in this \ndomain, there was conflict between those who wanted to find standards by which to contrast \nnormal and pathological ageing and those who considered this endeavour as entirely \npointless. \n \nThe questions of definition raised during these diverse encounters were most clearly \ndelineated during the first CIBA Foundation Colloquium on Ageing, which was held in 1954, \nimmediately after the first meeting of the International Gerontological Association. The list \nof participants included the leading experts of the day on the biology of ageing. According to \nthe published proceedings of the colloquium, following the chairman\u2018s introduction of the \nconcluding, general discussion, Alex Comfort, Nuffield Research Fellow in the Department \nZoology at University College, London, intervened in the following terms: \nI would like to put in a plea for [Professor Medawar\u2018s] definition of senescence as \nthe increase in liability to die with advancing age. It may be proper to distinguish \nageing from senescence, but in that case I think we can scrap ageing altogether \nand call it development, because gerontology is an entity which only comes into \nexistence to describe a process human beings don\u2018t like, a deteriorative process, \nand I take it that it is senescence with which we are concerned here.  \nEarlier in the meeting Dr. Lansing made a declaration of faith on the subject of the \noverall unity of the senescent process. I don\u2018t want to speak out of turn, but I\u2018m \nsomewhat sceptical of [the] underlying unity of any ageing process. \nComfort\u2018s call for a conventional definition of \u2017ageing\u2018 did not go unchallenged. Albert \nLansing, from the Department of Anatomy at Washington University, responded: \nBut take the male rotifer: it is born, it has no alimentary trait and dies of starvation \nwithin twenty-four hours after fertilizing. Does he die of senescence? I\u2018d rather \nput him in a special category, as a very degenerate character who starves to death \nin the twenty-four-hour period that he is busy fertilizing. [...] When I think of \nsenescence I think of something that happens not to children or to infant rotifers, \nbut to the organism that has become an adult and then undergone some type of \nchange, to wind up dead sooner or later. That\u2018s what I mean by senescence. The \nmaturation of the embryo, the new born child, the adolescent, the changes with \ntime prior to maturation, to me are not senescence. \nCowdry: Yours is the downswing of life, then. \nPage | 7 \n \nLansing: Yes, after adulthood has been reached. I can\u2018t define adulthood too well, \nand in some cases the changes that occur in adulthood are said to be \nimprovements rather than losses. \nCowdry: You don\u2018t have to define it if you just call it the downswing, that implies \nthat after a height you start to go down. \nComfort: Do you agree then that for various organisms the factors that contribute \nto that downswing tend to differ very radically from phylum to phylum? \nLansing: I\u2018m not prepared to agree to that. I think we have special cases which \nbring about death, but not all death is due to senescence. [...] The declaration of \nfaith I made yesterday stems in part from the various types of survival curves that \nDr. Comfort showed us. [...] It would be quite a coincidence if all these processes \nall expressed themselves in the same way. \nComfort: Raymond Pearl plotted a survival curve for automobiles which was \nagain the same shape!  \nAt this point, Nathan Shock, the Director of the Gerontology Section of the National Heart \nInstitute\/National Institutes of Health and effective founder of the International \nGerontological Association, interjected: \nI think the argument that because two different phenomena can be made to fit the \nsame mathematical formulation they have common processes behind them is an \nextremely hazardous one. \nLansing: I said only that it\u2018s a possibility, I\u2018m not prepared to say that we have as \nmany kinds of protoplasm as we have species. I think there is common protoplasm \nwith basic properties of multiplication and growth, decline, irritability and so on, \nvarying in detail, not in principle. \nShock sought to bring the argument to a close in the following terms: \nI would agree that protoplasm is probably fundamentally much the same stuff, \nalthough we know that various tissues develop different functions, so that their \nenzyme systems must vary quite widely between different cells in the same \nanimal. To that extent, I would agree that perhaps if you knew what it was that \ncaused a cell to lose its ability to maintain concentration gradients, maintain its \nmetabolic processes, you would be a long way toward understanding the ageing \nprocess. But it seems to me that the techniques that we have for investigating \nsingle cells are very meagre. Dr. Cowdry feels that if you take a cell out of its \ntissue it is no longer a cell. If we accept this position we are limited to unicellular \norganisms for study, but unfortunately most of these species simply divide and \nform two new cells so that \u2017ageing\u2018 fails to occur. Thus, we are faced with the \nproblem of studying more complex animals or tissue, using both biochemical and \nphysiological techniques. Since changes in the environment of the cell, produced \nby changing the diet of the animal, will often result in alterations in cellular \nenzymes, it seems to me that perhaps we are going to have to look at the problem \nPage | 8 \n \nof ageing from a number of different levels simultaneously and not try at the \nmoment to conceptualize the entire problem in one framework. Prof. Medawar \nhas approached the problem from a statistical evaluation of life tables; I am not \nprepared to accept this approach as the only way out of the difficulties. I think the \nexamination of life table might be an index as to what you were doing to a \nprocess, but if you are going to explain ageing as a process I think ultimately you \nhave to look at individuals, and perhaps the best way is to look at them from \ndifferent points of view and at different levels of organization. I doubt if it would \nbe possible to formulate a definition of ageing that would be acceptable to \neverybody and would cover all the aspects of the problem as it now stands \n(Wolstenholme & Cameron, 1955: 240-244). \nThis debate can be regarded as the confrontation of three different visions of the biology of \nageing, underpinned by disparate epistemic and political commitments. The first of these was \nthat advanced by Comfort and Peter Medawar, Professor of Zoology at University College, \nLondon. Theirs was the perspective of population geneticists working with life tables and \nrelying on evolutionary arguments to explain differences between populations and species. \nOn their account, ageing or senescence was an age-specific aggregation of biological \nphenomena that were physiologically unrelated and peculiar to animals protected from the \nrigours of natural selection. This understanding suggests that any interventions they might \nhave envisioned would operate at the aggregate, population level. Against this perspective, \nwas that of experimental biologists such as Cowdry and Lansing, who relied on particular \norganisms to produce models of physiological phenomena that were assumed to obtain across \ndifferent species. From this perspective, ageing was to be regarded as a unitary phenomenon \nthat occurred in all organisms at some point in their developmental cycle and any \ninterventions should operate at the cellular level. The third perspective, represented by Shock, \nwas firstly that the first two perspectives were epistemologically equivalent, and, secondly, \nthat the individual should be regarded as the fundamental biological unit which could then be \nexamined \u2017from different points of view\u2018. This programme was to be delivered by \nphysiological measurements of the ageing individual in the laboratory, clinic or community \nso as to establish standards of \u2017normal ageing\u2018 and would leave to clinicians the task of \nmanaging the pathologies of ageing.  \n \nImportantly, Shock\u2018s ability to subsume the first two perspectives and to do so with sufficient \nauthority to close the debate, at least temporarily, was not underpinned by some alternative \ndisciplinary approach, but by changes happening elsewhere. Shock\u2018s proposal to embrace \n\u2017different points of view\u2018 aimed to integrate gerontology in the institutional transformation \nsparked by the creation of the National Institutes of Health and correlated private and public \nPage | 9 \n \ninvestments in research programmes on cancer and heart disease that have come to define the \nbiomedical enterprise (see Gaudilli\u00e8re, 2002; also Keating & Cambrosio, 2003). It is to the \nproject of integrating gerontology with the emerging biomedical enterprise that we now turn. \n \nCoordinating medicine, biology and old age \nThere can be little doubt that, during the 1950s and 1960s, Nathan Shock played a pivotal \nrole in integrating gerontological research within the changing institutional organisation of \nAmerican medical research, and in aligning gerontology with the normative requirements of \nemergent biomedicine (see Achenbaum, 1995). This was encapsulated primarily in the design \nof the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), which Shock began to develop in the \nmid-1950s to measure individual functional capacity over time (see Bookstein & \nAchenbaum, 1993). Although contemporary with the longitudinal studies which characterised \nAmerican public health research during these years, such as the Framingham Heart Study \n(see Oppenheimer, 2005; Rothstein, 2003), the BLSA was distinctive insofar as it focussed \non \u2017healthy individuals\u2018 alone, to the exclusion of all those who contracted any illnesses. This \nwas due to Shock\u2018s interest in disentangling \u2017pure ageing\u2018 from \u2017disease\u2018 and so providing \nthe standard that would guide geriatricians in their diagnosis and management of old age \nillnesses (Shock, 1956; 1961). This concurred with the aims of geriatricians themselves. \nFrom the 1940s onward, American geriatrics aimed to establish itself within medical \nspecialities, and, as Hirshbein (2000) has suggested, this was achieved by evoking a notion of \nnormal ageing and then defining the expertise of the geriatrician as dealing with the \nprevention and treatment of diseases of old age. Gerontology, particularly the physiological \nand functional measurement provided by case-controlled or longitudinal studies such as those \nthat Shock proposed, was construed as providing the requisite biological standards. \nImportantly, Shock\u2018s distinction between normal and pathological ageing served not only \nclinical, but also political goals when the plan to establish a national programme of research \ninto the causes of the diseases commonly associated with old age finally moved onto the \nnational political agenda and was constructed on this same distinction (Achenbaum, 1995). \nEqually importantly, while the distinction would appear to have enabled a hybrid \nunderstanding of normal ageing that was workable in the clinic and the laboratory, the \ndevelopment of gerontology was constrained by its institutional association with the \nVeterans\u2018 Administration (VA) (Haber, 1986; Achenbaum, 1995) such that it was only when \nthe claims advanced by ever larger numbers of ageing veterans started to strain the VA\u2018s \nresources that the calls to establish a national programme of research into the causes of the \nPage | 10 \n \ndiseases associated with old age gained any political support. In other words, the solidity of \nthe alignment between Shock and the nascent National Institute of Ageing (NIA) should not \nbe overestimated and it perhaps is no surprise that, despite Shock\u2018s ambitions to create a \nnational programme of research that might help to differentiate healthy from unhealthy \nageing, the NIA only secured a firm political foothold when it began consistently to sponsor \nresearch on what, at least according to Robert Butler, has today has become the defining \ndisease of old age, Alzheimer\u2018s Disease (AD) (Anon., 2008; see also Ballenger, 2006). \n \nIn the United Kingdom, a different configuration of medicine, biology and old age not only \ndistanced gerontology from biology altogether, but resulted ultimately in the significant \nweakening of gerontology as an autonomous discipline. Some of the reasons for this fate are \nmost evident by comparing the disciplinary affiliations of the participants in the CIBA \nFoundation Colloquium and the Nuffield Trust conference on the \u2017biology of ageing\u2018. While \nno social scientists appear to have been invited to attend the CIBA Foundation Symposium, \nother than in an honorary capacity, the conference funded by the Nuffield Trust was \norganised by, and attracted, a very diverse group of experts, some being either zoologists or \nbotanists and others being either clinicians, psychologists or economists. The challenge was \nthen to establish how their diverse expertise might be coordinated so as to address the social \nand political question posed by ageing. This situation is not surprising given that the Nuffield \nFoundation was renowned firstly as the sponsor of the Survey Committee on the Problems of \nAgeing and the Care of People and that, in the absence of any substantial, structured funding \nby the Medical Research Council (MRC) for research on the biology of ageing, the Nuffield \nFoundation supported a variety of academic programmes that relied on equally varied \nmethods, though focussing primarily on the importance of social and economic conditions to \nthe definition of \u2017normal\u2018 ageing. Furthermore, as Martin (1995) has observed, it was not \nthrough the laboratory but \u2017through the technique of the survey [that] doctors created a body \nof knowledge relating to the social, economic, and medical needs of the aged population in \ntheir own districts\u2018 (458). In the process, British geriatricians defined gerontology as the \nfield, in Lord Amulree\u2018s words, concerned with \u2017those elderly sick with social and economic \nproblems\u2018 (460; our italics). Importantly, this construction positioned gerontology outside the \nhospital, the main research platform of British biomedicine during the second half of the \ntwentieth century (Stewart, 2008). Furthermore, the consequent association between the old \nage and that peculiarly British disciplinary integration of social and medical science that went \nby the name of \u2017social medicine\u2018 was responsible for much uncertainty around the place of \nPage | 11 \n \nthe elderly within the National Health Service (NHS). Under these circumstances, any \nfunding for research on the medical problems posed by older people tended to be allocated to \ndisease specific programmes within the MRC because there seemed to be nothing so \nbiologically and clinically distinctive and remarkable about the patients\u2018 chronological age as \nto deserve the attention of a specialist (see also Ballenger, 2006). Finally, in the 1960s and \n1970s, when social medicine lost its precarious institutional support within both the MRC and \nNHS (Porter, 1997), British gerontology lost all residual disciplinary legitimacy. Thus, \ndespite the fact that at the time of the CIBA Foundation Colloquium the evolutionary \nperspective on ageing was a wholly British and very vibrant current, institutional and political \nfactors had worked together to progressively disconnect biological explanations of ageing \nfrom any public debates and programmes to address the \u2017problem of old age\u2018 so that Peter \nMedawar could declare in 1977 that British gerontology was moribund and that \u2017those \nanxious about the possible malefactions of research on ageing should take comfort from the \nfact that the great public and private agencies are not competing with each other in their \nendeavours to support research on ageing\u2018 (Medawar & Medawar, 1977: 159). \n \nIn sum, if the \u2017problem of old age\u2018 emerged during the years between the late 1930s and early \n1950s as a pressing political question and a variety of powerful institutions became interested \nin the biology of ageing, the successful alignment of ageing, biology and medicine was a \nhighly contingent and unstable affair. \n \nThe trouble with the National Institute of Aging \nIt is widely acknowledged that the establishment of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) was \na difficult and protracted matter. Importantly, while the difficulties have been portrayed as a \nmatter of divergence between gerontologists and the medical establishment (Lockett, 1983), \nthere also is evidence of divergence among gerontologists themselves over the framing of a \ncoordinated programme of research on the biological origins of ageing.  \n \nBetween 1963 and 1965, Leonard Hayflick, a cytologist working in the expansive domain of \nexperimental oncology, challenged the notion that cell lines were potentially immortal by \ndemonstrating that the number of replications cells could undergo was limited and that the \nlimit was fixed by cellular mechanisms that were eventually located within the nucleus \n(Landecker, 2007). The challenge went unnoticed among oncologists because the notion that \ncell lines were potentially immortal was too solidly embedded in the material practices of \nPage | 12 \n \nexperimental oncology, but it did not go unnoticed among gerontologists insofar as it offered \nscope to rearticulate and revitalise Edmund Cowdry\u2018s experimental approach to ageing. This \ninterest came to a head in 1973, when Hayflick received the Robert Kleemeier Award, which \nthe Gerontological Society of America bestowed annually \u2017in recognition of outstanding \nresearch in the field of gerontology\u2018. In his acceptance lecture, Hayflick (1974), while \nadmitting feeling \u2017somewhat uncomfortable in accepting an award for work which at the \noutset was undertaken with the biology of aging farthest from [his] mind\u2018 (37), was quick to \npropose the following: \nWhat are the implications to gerontologists of the notions that are emerging from \ncytogerontology? I believe that there are several important implications. The first \nis that the primary causes of age changes can no longer be thought of as resulting \nfrom events occurring at the supracellular level, i.e., at cell hierarchies from the \ntissue level and greater. The cell is where the gerontological action lies. I believe \ntherefore that purely descriptive studies done at the tissue, organ and whole \nanimal level, as they pertain to the biology of aging, are less likely to yield \nimportant information on mechanism than studies done at the cell and molecular \nlevel (39; our italics). \nIn other words, according to Hayflick, investigations of ageing would be most productive \nwhen grounded in the methods of \u2017cytogerontology\u2018, the new field of research which \nHayflick himself was busy trying to define and delineate, but he also seemed intent on \nchallenging Shock\u2018s programme for the development of gerontology, firstly because Shock \nhad justified his focus on individuals on the grounds that the cellular level concerned only a \nsubset of the gerontological phenomena and secondly because the list of \u2017purely descriptive \nstudies\u2018 of ageing presumably included the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (see also \nAchenbaum, 1995). There was more, however. If Shock\u2018s programme was underpinned by \nthe need to distinguish between normal and pathological aging, on Hayflick\u2018s vision this \nwould become a problematic endeavour:  \nOne is forced to conclude that if all disease related causes of death were to be \nresolved, then the aging processes would present some clear physical \nmanifestations well in advance of death itself. The challenge, of course, is to \nseparate disease-related changes from the basic biological changes that are a part \nof the aging process. Since fundamental aging processes most certainly contribute \nto or allow for the expression of pathology, then the two concepts may be so \nclosely intertwined as to make any clear distinctions a futile exercise in semantics \n(43). \nThe question about the relationship between the normal and pathological which Hayflick thus \nposed rested explicitly on Alex Comfort\u2018s well-established evolutionary explanation of \nPage | 13 \n \nageing (see Moreira & Palladino, 2008). Natural selection, Comfort argued, operated most \nforcefully on those phases of the life cycle which were related to reproduction, so that the \nexpression of any deleterious mutations in these phases would be targeted more strongly than \ntheir expression in post-reproductive phases. This, according to Comfort, led to an \naccumulation of deleterious genes whose expression occurred in the later phases of the life \ncycle, eventually resulting in the genetic determination of the post-reproductive weakening of \nthe organism commonly named \u2017ageing\u2018. From this evolutionary perspective, seeking to \n\u2017separate disease-related changes from the basic biological changes that are a part of the \naging process\u2018 was questionable, to say the least. Significantly, just two years after these \ncritical declarations, Hayflick was mentioned as a possible first director of the NIA, thus \nillustrating the force of his criticism of Shock\u2018s programme, but Hayflick\u2018s accompanying \nambition to totally reconfigure the organisation of gerontological research may also have \nbeen the reason for its limited institutionalisation. Thus, the first director of the NIA was not \nHayflick, but Robert Butler, psychologist and author of the best-selling and prize-winning \nbook Why Survive? Growing Old in America (1975) (see also Ballenger, 2006).  \n \nOne of the greatest challenges confronting Butler upon his appointment was the lack of \nresearch capacity and limited public interest in gerontology. Despite Butler\u2018s attempts to \nenrol policy makers and congressional committees, the NIA struggled to secure any steady \nstream of resources. Thus, when he suggested that \u2017research on aging has shifted from its \nexclusive disease orientation toward a more comprehensive investigation of the normal, \nphysiological changes with age\u2018 (Butler, 1977: 8; our italics), the evocation of normality was \nrelated more to the need to rearticulate how the American public viewed older people\u2018s role \nin society, than to the needs of clinicians working with older people. The situation only \nchanged with the emergence of what Butler called the \u2017health politics of anguish\u2018 (Fox, 1989: \n82), an alliance of activists, clinicians and politicians who called public attention to the \nabandonment experienced by sufferers of senile dementia and those around them. This \nresulted in the prioritisation of research into the causes and treatment of Alzheimer\u2018s Disease \n(AD), particularly through the NIA\u2018s extramural research programme, which embodied \nemerging, competition-driven innovation policies that were based on both collaborations \nbetween universities and pharmaceutical companies and ideals of \u2017rational\u2018 therapeutic \ndevelopment from bench to bedside (Moreira, 2009). It should be noted, that, despite Butler\u2018s \nlater disenchantment with the direction taken by the NIA, his own programme for the \ndevelopment of gerontology could be said to have facilitated the change insofar as it rested \nPage | 14 \n \non the transformation of individual failures to adapt and age \u2017successfully\u2018 from a matter of \npsychic disposition into a matter of organic pathology (Ballenger, 2003). More importantly, \nhowever, with the support thus gained, the NIA experienced an extraordinary influx of \nresearchers from other areas of biomedical research. This helped to transform the NIA\u2018s place \nin the American polity, but in the form of a highly visible disease-specific programme that \neventually accounted for the majority of NIA\u2018s budget. This caused considerable \ndissatisfaction among a number of gerontologists. As Richard Miller (2002) has noted, and \nplaintively so, \u2017senators\u2018 and voters\u2018 parents [die] of specific diseases\u2018 and are less likely to \nfund a general, \u2017basic\u2018 programme of research on ageing. In sum, AD firmly established the \nposition of the NIA within the political and clinical worlds, but only by emphasising the \nequation of ageing and illness. If gerontologists such as Butler, Hayflick and Miller felt that \nan opportunity had been a missed, however, this situation also created the conditions for an \nunlikely alliance between programmes aiming to distinguish between normal and \npathological ageing, on the one hand, and investigations of ageing at the cellular and sub-\ncellular level, on the other hand.  \n \nBiogerontology and the promise of health \nDuring the 1990s, the alignment of evolutionary models and genetic research which Richard \nDawkins\u2018s Selfish Gene (1976) had by then popularised very successfully renewed \ngerontologists\u2018 interest in the evolutionary understanding of ageing, especially because it \nseemed to promise a new articulation of the problem of old age and how to address them (see \nalso Nesse & Williams, 1996). This is powerfully illustrated by the increasing importance \nattached to Thomas Kirkwood\u2018s work.  \n \nKirkwood (1977) rearticulated Alex Comfort\u2018s evolutionary explanation by combining \nmolecular and demographic analyses to advance the notion that the organism should be \nunderstood as the product of a historical process involving the balancing of energetic \ninvestments in the somatic body, to enhance the chances of successful reproduction of the \ngerminal line, and the cost of these investments to the continuity of the germinal line. On this \nunderstanding of ageing, attention is then directed toward the molecular mechanisms \ninvolved in the preservation of genomic integrity, or, as Kirkwood has put it, toward \u2017the \nevolved capacity of somatic cells to carry out effective maintenance and repair\u2018 (Kirkwood & \nAustad, 2000: 235). Importantly, in this new vision, the business of gerontology becomes to \nenhance the ability of the individual to approximate the immortal germinal line, even if \nPage | 15 \n \nimmortality itself is irretrievably denied by the evolutionary history of the human species. \nThe hope is that this redefinition will at least result in maximising the biological functionality \nof the individual up to the moment of death. Thus conceived, gerontology ceases to be a field \nof clinical specialisation concerned with the diseases of a distinct population, the elderly, as \nthese diseases are rearticulated as unfolding temporally onto antecedent risk factors and \nbiomolecular pathways. Biomolecular and demographic pathways of individuals who might \nbe \u2017at risk\u2018 of developing pathologies such as cardio-vascular disease, cancer and dementia \nare traced backward, to the earliest possible molecular, behavioural or clinical manifestations, \naiming to develop multiple preventative interventions. These pathologies thus become part of \na wider set of \u2017degenerative diseases\u2018 that are only connected contingently to the organism\u2018s \nchronological age. Within this framework, all degenerative diseases might be said to entail \n\u2017ageing\u2018, but in so expanding its domain of application the term \u2017ageing\u2018 no longer identifies \na distinct biological process of its own kind. Equally importantly, because the domain of \ngerontology thus defined is resistive to any precise delimitation, it can become an object of \ninterest for all clinical practitioners involved in managing degenerative diseases, from the \nprimary care practitioners controlling middle-age hypertension to the specialised clinicians \nrequired to train these practitioners in the assessment of the earliest symptoms of cardio-\nvascular weakening. Furthermore, gerontology also offers opportunities of development to a \ngreat variety of actors in the market for health care as investigation of the mechanisms \ninvolved in the onset of these degenerative diseases greatly expands opportunities for \npharmaceutical companies because the threshold of treatment moves ever backward to \nencompass a greater fraction of the population. This said, the investigation of these same \nmechanisms also offers opportunities to those providing the wherewithal and support to \nsecure \u2017healthy lifestyles\u2018 from birth to death. In so doing, biogerontology promises to deliver \na central expectation of private and public health care insurers, namely reducing the \nprevalence of degenerative diseases so as to reduce the aggregate cost of provision. \n \nImportantly, by drawing on evolutionary biology to explore organisms\u2018 life histories in \nrelation to the genome and the environment, the biogerontological programme enables links \nbetween the laboratory, preventative medicine and health maintenance programmes. One of \nthe key changes in the organisation of research, clinical practice and policy at the end of the \ntwentieth century has been the shift from the \u2017problem of disease\u2018 to the \u2017problem of health\u2018. \nThis entails not only constructing an understanding of the molecular, individual and social \ndynamics that lead to illness, rather than just focussing on restoring health, but also reliance \nPage | 16 \n \non preventative therapeutic strategies and health promotion programmes. These in turn are \nsustained by enhanced surveillance technologies which regulate access to therapies and \nprogrammes by identifying risk factors or states and supporting individuals\u2018 re-organisation \nof their conduct in light of such risks (Clarke et al., 2003; May et al., 2006; Rose, 2007). \nSignificantly, in so doing, biogerontologists differentiate themselves from the \u2017anti-ageing\u2018 \nmovement and medicine (Olshansky et al., 2002; see also Juengst et al., 2003 and Fishman et \nal., 2008). While the latter argue for an interventionist approach to ageing, ageing being \nconceived in this case as a \u2017natural\u2018, but \u2017modifiable\u2018, process (Mykytyn, 2008), \nbiogerontologists suggest that there is in fact nothing \u2017natural\u2018 about ageing. Instead, the \nplasticity of the human organism, and in particular how first death and then ageing have been \nsignificantly postponed during the last few centuries, is where biogerontologists draw support \nto propose the further expansion of public health measures to further this historical process. \nConsequently, in a recent public statement, a number of influential biogerontologists and \nrepresentatives of non-governmental charitable organisations have argued that \u2017the \nexploration of the mechanisms by which ageing can be postponed in laboratory models will \nyield new models of preventive medicine and health maintenance for people throughout life, \nand the same research will also inform a deeper understanding of how established \ninterventions, such as exercise and healthy nutrition, contribute to lifelong wellbeing\u2018 (Butler \net al., 2008: 399). In so doing, they call upon individuals identified through screening \nprogrammes and characterised through a variety of molecular and demographic markers to \nproduce and maintain their own health. Such promise of health can only be realised however \nif research policies provide the means to focus on the basic biology of ageing and abandon \nbiomedicine and its disease-driven business.  \n \nConclusion \nDuring the past decade, discontent with the organisation of research into the causes and \ntreatment of diseases associated with age has motivated highly visible public debates in both \nthe United States and the United Kingdom. In this context, a number of influential \nbiogerontologists have offered an alternative to disease-specific programmes which calls into \nquestion both biomedicine and the historical opposition between biomedicine and public \nhealth. Such proposals, as we have argued elsewhere, could be taken as evidence of a \ntransformation of socio-political forms of management whereby \u2017the individual of the 19th \ncentury biopolitical imaginary, a human body whose biological constitution was irremediably \nfixed at birth, is giving way to an understanding of the human body as an assembly of \nPage | 17 \n \nbiomolecular components that can be [\u2026] recombined so as to maximize the resultant unit\u2018s \ncultural, social and political productivity\u2018 (Moreira & Palladino, 2008: 21). Whether and how \nthe proposed link between the laboratory, preventative medicine and health maintenance \nprogrammes will work in practice is however a matter of empirical case studies of the \ndevelopment, mediation and use of emerging gerontological technologies. Furthermore, as \nwe have argued in this paper, such studies should not be underpinned by a critical appraisal \nof biogerontology as a \u2017biomedicalization of ageing\u2018 because biogerontology positions itself \noutside the institutions of biomedicine. In other words, the challenge for future studies will be \nto understand how the current uncertainties of the biogerontological programme play out in \nmultiple social and political arenas. \n \nFinally, some of the uncertainty involved in the future development of the biogerontological \nprogramme is evident in the reluctance with which the British government has greeted some \nof the recommendations advanced in the House of Lords Report on Ageing (2005). The \nScience and Technology Committee of the House of Lords was particularly surprised that it \nwas not the Science Secretary who responded to its report, a report on the \u2017scientific aspects \nof ageing\u2018 (our italics), but the Minister for Work and Pensions, who argued that \u2017old age\u2018 \nhad long been a major concern of the Government and that it had already invested very \nheavily in the improvement of health and social care, as well as pensions. Citing a \nmemorandum by one of the chief scientific advisors involved in the preparation of the report, \nThomas Kirkwood, the Science and Technology Committee wrote:  \nIt is particularly disappointing that the Government seem to wish to \u2017pigeon-hole\u2018 \nageing research, as if ageing were an isolated, discrete problem, and that research \ninto ageing must necessarily compete with research into other areas. Thus the \nresponse reproduces the familiar mantra that \u2017given finite resources, there will \nalways be a need to balance competing priorities for research\u2018. As we sought to \ndemonstrate in our Report\u2014a point repeated by Professor Kirkwood in his written \ncomments\u2014ageing is a continuum, affecting all of us all the time. He also \nreiterates the point made in our Report, that generic research into the process of \nageing, far from being in competition with research into specific conditions \naffecting older people, may be \u2017the most direct route to developing novel \ninterventions and therapies\u2018. There is no sign of such holistic thinking in the \nGovernment response (House of Lords, 2006a). \nThe Science and Technology Committee\u2018s contrast between \u2017specific conditions affecting \nolder people\u2018 and the notion that \u2017ageing is a continuum, affecting all of us all the time\u2018 was \ninformed by Kirkwood\u2018s more specific observation that, \u2017there are scientific connections \nPage | 18 \n \nbetween birth, early years, childhood and adolescence that have major impacts on health and \nquality of life in middle and old age. These need much greater attention ...\u2018 (House of Lords, \n2006b). What might explain the Department of Work and Pensions\u2018 rejection of the House of \nLords\u2018 recommendations may be that the Department remains committed to the needs of a \nspecific subset of the population, the chronologically aged and their distinctive social \nproblems. If this surmise is correct, it indicates that there are significant obstacles to the \nbiogerontological programme and that they stem from the coexistence of biopolitical and \ndisciplinary modes of governance.  \n  \nPage | 19 \n \nNotes\n \n1\n Defining biogerontology, especially in relation to the \u2017anti-ageing\u2018 movement and medicine, \nis fraught with difficulties and ambiguities (Juengst et al. 2003; Fishman et al. 2008), but we \nhope that the account we provide here goes some way toward clarifying differences. \n2\n The interview was conducted in the context of the ESRC funded project \u2017Boundary work, \nnormal ageing and brain pathology\u2018. \nPage | 20 \n \nBibliography \nAchenbaum, Andrew W.
