We go beyond earlier studies of\nnoise-induced synchronisation (without couplings) and coupling-induced synchronisation (without\ncommon noise) to consider both effects together, and we obtain a result that is very different from\na straightforward superposition of the effects of each agent acting alone: two regimes are possible\ndepending on which agent is inducing the synchronisation. In each regime, one agent induces and\nthe other hinders the synchronisation. In particular we show that, counterintuitively, coupling can\nsometimes inhibit synchronisation.\nCopyright c\u00a9 EPLA, 2009\nSynchronisation occurs universally between interacting\noscillatory processes both in Nature and technology [1].\nThe phenomenon consists of the mutual adjustment of\nthe oscillatory rhythms. It can usefully be described\nin terms of phase dynamics provided that the inter-\noscillator interactions and noise are relatively weak [2].\nWhere the synchronisation is due to phase coupling\nvia the inter-oscillator interactions, the underlying\nmechanism is well understood. Synchronisation can also\narise in a different way, however, through the influ-\nence of common noise on the two systems. This latter\nmechanism has been observed in many natural and\nexperimental systems, such as lasers [3], neurons [4,5],\nand ecological systems [6]. Such noise-induced synchro-\nnisation in phase oscillators has been studied by\nanalyses of the Lyapunov exponent [7], and by use of\nthe Fokker-Planck equation [8] to study the phenom-\nenon in completely uncoupled phase oscillators [9\u201311].\nIn the real world, however, it is common for oscillatory\nsystems to be influenced, not only by noise, but also by\ntheir mutual couplings [12].\nIn this letter we report a systematic analysis taking\nsimultaneous account of both possible routes to synchro-\nnisation. For added realism, we also include the effect of\nnon-common (independent) noise. We show analytically\n(a)Present address: Department of Earth and Environmental\nSciences, The Open University - Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, UK, EU;\nE-mail: david.dga@gmail.com\nand numerically how coupling and common noise compete\nin achieving synchronisation. We study the global synchro-\nnisation of the system via the Fokker-Planck approach,\nanalysing the distinct roles of non-common noise, common\nnoise, and couplings, and we reveal the competition that\noccurs between couplings and common noise. The most\nstriking result is that, although coupling and common\nnoise each favour synchronisation on their own, they\ncan each inhibit the synchronisation induced by the\nother when they coexist. For example, in regimes where\ncommon-noise synchronisation dominates, the existence\nof stronger couplings between the subsystems implies\npoorer synchronisation, contrary to intuition and common\nbelief.\nThe system. \u2013 We consider two coupled oscillators\nsubject to both common and independent noises:\nx\u02d9\u03b1(t) = F\u03b1(x\u03b1(t))+ \u0001\u03b1 V\u03b1(x1(t), x2(t))\n+G\u03b1(x\u03b1(t))\n\u221a\nD\u03b1 \u03be(t)+H\u03b1(x\u03b1(t))\n\u221a\nE\u03b1 \u03b7\u03b1(t),\n(1)\nfor \u03b1= 1, 2. Here x\u03b1 represents the \u03b1-th oscillator, F\u03b1 is its\nindividual dynamics, and the V \u2019s and \u0001\u2019s are, respectively,\nthe coupling functions and their magnitudes. \u03be(t) and\n\u03b7\u03b1(t) are the common and non-common noises. G and\nH represent the couplings of the oscillators to the noises.\n\u03be(t) and \u03b7\u03b1(t) are assumed to be independent, Gaussian,\n30005-p1\nD.

For the general equations (1), the noises\nmay be either multiplicative, or additive by making the\nfunctions G and\/or H equal to unity; but the noises will\nbecome multiplicative for the phase dynamics. We seek\nto establish how much synchronisation of a given order\nn:m [1] eqs. (2) can yield, quantified by evaluating how\nclose to a constant value the generalized phase difference\n\u03c6\u2212 stays over time. So we make an invertible change of\nvariables from \u03c61 and \u03c62 to \u03c6+ and \u03c6\u2212:\n\u03c6\u2212 =m\u03c61\u2212n\u03c62, \u03c6+ =m\u03c61+n\u03c62,\n(3)\n\u03c61 = (\u03c6++\u03c6\u2212)\/(2m), \u03c62 = (\u03c6+\u2212\u03c6\u2212)\/(2n).\nThe functions v\u03b1, g\u03b1 and h\u03b1 in (2) must be 2\u03c0-periodic\nin all the phases, and can therefore be written as Fourier\nseries. As long as \u03c6\u2212 stays close to a constant, it is a good\napproximation for the coupling function just to consider\nthe harmonics that depend only on \u03c6\u2212, because those with\nany dependence on \u03c6+ correspond to fast oscillations [1].\nWe take for simplicity the lowest order of such harmonics\n(which is typically the most intense): v1(\u03c61(t), \u03c62(t)) is\ntherefore replaced by a1 sin\u03c6\u2212, and v2 is replaced by\n\u2212a2 sin\u03c6\u2212 (with this notation, same signs of a1\u00011 and a2\u00012\nmeans that the two coupling terms add up to an increased\neffective coupling intensity, whereas opposite signs make\nthe two terms subtract into a weaker effective coupling,\nas we will see in a moment). With this approximation for\nthe coupling function, and expanding g\u03b1 and h\u03b1 in Fourier\nseries, the equations for the phases are\n\u03c6\u02d91 = \u03c91+ \u03b51 sin\u03c6\u2212+\n\u221a\nD1\u03be(t)\n\u2211\nk\nb1,k sin(k\u03c61+ \u03b81,k)\n+\n\u221a\nE1\u03b71(t)\n\u2211\nl\nc1,l sin(l\u03c61+\u03d11,l),\n\u03c6\u02d92 = \u03c92\u2212 \u03b52 sin\u03c6\u2212+\n\u221a\nD2\u03be(t)\n\u2211\nk\u2032\nb2,k\u2032 sin(k\n\u2032\u03c62+ \u03b82,k\u2032)\n+\n\u221a\nE2\u03b72(t)\n\u2211\nl\u2032\nc2,l\u2032 sin(l\n\u2032\u03c62+\u03d12,l\u2032), (4)\nwhere \u03b5\u03b1 = a\u03b1 \u0001\u03b1. The sums run over the positive integers\n(and there are no terms independent of the phase). Using\nthese and the first equation of (3), we get\n\u03c6\u02d9\u2212 = \u03c9\u2212+ \u03b5+ sin\u03c6\u2212+ \u03be(t)\n[\nm\n\u2211\nk\nA1,k sin(k\u03c61+ \u03b81,k)\n\u2212n\n\u2211\nk\u2032\nA2,k\u2032 sin(k\n\u2032\u03c62+ \u03b82,k\u2032)\n]\n+m\u03b71(t)\n\u2211\nl\nB1,l sin(l\u03c61+\u03d11,l)\n\u2212n\u03b72(t)\n\u2211\nl\u2032\nB2,l\u2032 sin(l\n\u2032\u03c62+\u03d12,l\u2032),\nA\u03b1,k = b\u03b1,k\n\u221a\nD\u03b1, B\u03b1,k = c\u03b1,k\n\u221a\nE\u03b1.\n\u03c9\u2212 =m\u03c91\u2212n\u03c92 is the mismatch, and the \u201ceffective\ncoupling\u201d \u03b5+ is defined as m\u03b51+n\u03b52. We will assume\n\u03b5+ > 0, so the tendency of the coupling is to drive the\ntwo oscillators at around \u03c6\u2212 = \u03c0, as we will see later.\nThe latter point should be noted carefully by readers\naccustomed to considering synchronisation near \u03c6\u2212 = 0,\nin which case \u03b5+ > 0 would be regarded as repulsive\ncoupling. This is not our case: here, synchronisation can\nhappen near different values of \u03c6\u2212, depending on the\nvalues of the parameters of the system (see below). We\nrecall that, when synchronisation in our system is due to\ncoupling, \u03c6\u2212 stays around \u03c0.\nFokker-Planck analysis. \u2013 We choose to use the Ito\nversion of the associated Fokker-Planck equation though,\nin fact (see below), the Stratonovich version leads to the\nsame final results. Out of \u03c6+(t) and \u03c6\u2212(t), the former\nis fast-varying: in the absence of couplings and noises,\n\u03c6\u03b1(t) = \u03c9\u03b1t, so \u03c6+(t) = \u03c9+t. For our case with couplings\nand noises, corrections must be made to this expression;\nbut, provided all the couplings and noise strengths are\nsmall compared to the frequency \u03c9\u03b1, such corrections\nwill be small compared to the quickly growing term \u03c9+t.\nThus, we can take \u03c6+(t)\u2248 \u03c9+t, and we may integrate\nout \u03c6+ over one period in the Fokker-Planck equation.\nHence only those terms that do not contain any derivative\nwith respect to \u03c6+ will be relevant. The equation for the\nprobability density W (\u03c6+, \u03c6\u2212, t) is [8]\n\u2202tW = \u2212\u2202\u03c6\u2212 [(\u03c9\u2212+ \u03b5+ sin\u03c6\u2212)W ]\n+(1\/2)\u22022\u03c6\u2212\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n[\nm\n\u2211\nk\nA1,k sin(k\u03c61+ \u03b81,k)\n\u2212n\n\u2211\nk\u2032\nA2,k\u2032 sin(k\n\u2032\u03c62+ \u03b82,k\u2032)\n]2\nW\n+\n[\nm\n\u2211\nl\nB1,l sin(l\u03c61+\u03d11,l)\n]2\nW\n+\n[\nn\n\u2211\nl\u2032\nB2,l\u2032 sin(l\n\u2032\u03c62+\u03d12,l\u2032)\n]2\nW\n\uf8fc\uf8fd\n\uf8fe+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (5)\n30005-p2\nCompetition between noise and coupling in the induction of synchronisation\nwhere the suspension points stand for the terms involving\nat least a derivative with respect to \u03c6+. We will study\ncases where the intensity of at least one noise is enough\nto yield a stationary solution for which \u2202W\/\u2202t= 0. Then\nwe can suppose that the probability density W is almost\nindependent of the fast variable \u03c6+, because \u03c6+ \u2248 \u03c9+t,\nso t\u2248 \u03c6+\/\u03c9+ and therefore 0 = \u2202W\/\u2202t\u2248 \u03c9+ \u2202W\/\u2202\u03c6+,\nfrom which we get \u2202W\/\u2202\u03c6+ \u2248 0. As a result, we can work\nwith the probability density P (\u03c6\u2212) resulting from the\nintegration of W within a period of \u03c6+. From the second\nline of (3), we see that the system is 4nm\u03c0-periodic in the\nvariables \u03c6+ and \u03c6\u2212. P (\u03c6\u2212) is then defined as P (\u03c6\u2212) =\n(1\/4nm\u03c0)\n\u222b 4nm\u03c0\n0\nW (\u03c6+, \u03c6\u2212)d\u03c6+ \u2248W (\u03c6\u2212), where the\ntime dependence was taken out of W because of the\nstationary condition, and W was approximated as being\nindependent of \u03c6+ in the last step.\nIn (5), we replace W by P (\u03c6\u2212), write \u03c61 and \u03c62 as\na function of \u03c6+ and \u03c6\u2212, and integrate out \u03c6+ between\n0 and 4nm\u03c0. The integrals for the terms with A\u2019s and\nB\u2019s are independent of \u03c6\u2212 except for some of the cross-\nterms coming from the first square bracket in (5): most\nof the latter integrate out to 0, except for the resonant\nones: i.e. those where k= um and k\u2032 = un, with u integer.\nThese resonant terms play a vital role, as we will see:\nit is so important that we can make a very convenient\nsimplification preserving all the interesting features: we\nzero all the A1,k except for k=m, and all the A2,k\u2032 except\nfor k\u2032 = n. We therefore redefine A1,m \u2261A1 and A2,n \u2261A2.\nThe B\u2019s do not generate any interesting cross-terms, so\nwe can simplify by zeroing them all except for the lowest-\norder terms: B1,1 \u2261B1 and B2,1 \u2261B2. Also for the sake\nof simplicity, we make 0 the two \u03b8\u2019s and the two \u03d1\u2019s\ncorresponding to the former non-zero terms. We end up\nwith a system that is simple enough to be analytically\ntackable, and complete enough to retain all the relevant\nfeatures. After integrating out \u03c6+ in (5), we get\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c6\u2212\n{\n\u2212 (\u03c9\u2212+ \u03b5+ sin\u03c6\u2212)P + 1\n4\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c6\u2212\n[\n(m2 (A21+B\n2\n1)\n+n2(A22+B\n2\n2)\u2212 2nmA1A2 cos\u03c6\u2212)P\n]}\n= 0. (6)\nNote that the integrals of the terms involving at least a\nderivative with respect to \u03c6+ are equal to zero because\nof periodicity. Derivations from the Ito and Stratonovich\nschemes here merge: had we used Stratonovich calculus,\nwe would have had extra terms for the Fokker-Planck\nequation for W (\u03c6+, \u03c6\u2212, t), but the resulting equation for\nP (\u03c6\u2212) after integration over \u03c6+ would be identical with\neq. (6). So the rest of the discussion is true for Ito as well\nas Stratonovich stochastic schemes. Equation (6) shows\nthat the expression inside the top-level bracket on the\nleft-hand side is a constant: the probability current S. If we\ncall f1(\u03c6\u2212) =\u22124 (\u03c9\u2212+ \u03b5+ sin\u03c6\u2212) and f2(\u03c6\u2212) =m2 (A21+\nB21)+n\n2 (A22+B\n2\n2)\u2212 2nmA1A2 cos\u03c6\u2212, eq. (6) yields\nP \u2032(\u03c6\u2212)+ [f1(\u03c6\u2212)+ f \u20322(\u03c6\u2212)]P (\u03c6\u2212)\/f2(\u03c6\u2212) = S\/f2(\u03c6\u2212),\nand the general solution of the differential equation is\nP (\u03c6\u2212) =\nS\n\u222b \u03c6\u2212\n\u03c60\nexp[V (x)] dx + N\nf2(\u03c6\u2212) exp[V (\u03c6\u2212)]\n, (7)\nwhere V (x) =\n\u222b x\nx0\nf1\/f2. The lower limits \u03c60 and x0 for\nthe former integrals are arbitrary, but once such\nvalues are chosen, they have to be kept the same. For\nconvenience, we set both equal to \u2212\u03c0. The constants N\nand S in (7) are obtained by requiring, first, that\nP (\u03c6\u2212) be 2\u03c0-periodic (because the equation to\nsolve (6) is 2\u03c0-periodic in \u03c6\u2212). Secondly for\nnormalization, we require the integral of P (\u03c6\u2212)\nover one period to be equal to 1.\nNote that f1(x) and f2(x) are 2\u03c0-periodic. A primitive\nV\u02dc (x) of f1\/f2 can be obtained analytically, valid inside\nthe interval \u2212\u03c0\u0001 x\u0001 \u03c0:\nV\u02dc (x) = \u2212 4\u03c0\u03c9\u2212\u221a\nR\n\u2212 8\u03c9\u2212\u221a\nR\narctan\n[\nT tan(x\/2)\u221a\nR\n]\n+\n2 \u03b5+\nA1A2mn\n{\nlnT \u2212 ln\n[ (\nA21+B\n2\n1\n)\nm2\n+\n(\nA22+B\n2\n2\n)\nn2\u2212 2A1A2mn cosx\n]}\n, (8)\nwhere\nR = (B21 m\n2+B22 n\n2)\n[\n(2A21+B\n2\n1)m\n2\n+(2A22+B\n2\n2)n\n2\n]\n+(A21m\n2\u2212A22 n2)2, (9)\nand\nT = (A1m+A2 n)\n2+B21 m\n2+B22 n\n2. (10)\nAlso, the definite integral IV of f1\/f2 within one period is\nV\u02dc (\u03c0)\u2212 V\u02dc (\u2212\u03c0):\nIV = \u2212 8\u03c0 \u03c9\u2212\u221a\nR\n. (11)\nPutting everything together, the integral that defines V (x)\ncan be obtained for any x, by writing x= (2\u03ba\u2212 1)\u03c0+\u03d5,\nwith \u03ba integer and 0\u0001\u03d5\u0001 2\u03c0: then V (x) = \u03ba IV + V\u02dc (\u2212\u03c0+\n\u03d5)\u2212 V\u02dc (\u2212\u03c0) = \u03ba IV + V\u02dc (\u2212\u03c0+\u03d5). Because IV is defined\nas the integral over one period (or from the former\nexpression), we find\nV (x+2\u03b1\u03c0) = V (x)+\u03b1 IV , \u03b1\u2208Z. (12)\nA relationship between the constants N and S in (7)\ncan be obtained by imposing the periodicity condition. By\nrequiring that P (\u03c6\u2212+2\u03c0) and P (\u03c6\u2212) be equal, we obtain\na relationship between S and N : S = [exp(IV )\u2212 1]N\/IP ,\nwhere\nIP =\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0\nexp[V (x)] dx, (13)\nto be obtained numerically. Note that, for IV = 0, or\nequivalently, the mismatch \u03c9\u2212 equal to 0, the probability\ncurrent S vanishes.

Two\nconclusions can be drawn. First, the bigger the absolute\nvalues of B1 and B2, the weaker the synchronisation:\nindependent noise is always harmful to synchronisation.\nSecondly, the smaller |mA1\u2212nA2| is, the closer the\nthird term will be to zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the\ncouplings of the common noise to the two oscillators\nshould be in the same n:m synchronisation ratio in order\nto optimally enhance the strength of synchronisation.\nSee fig. 1: for (b), mA1\u2212nA2 is equal to 0, and the\ncorresponding probability density is the most localised. So\nwe assume below that A1 and A2 have the same sign. For\nall numerical results we discretised eqs. (4) and used the\nHeun scheme [13] with a step of 0.01. The results of the\nsimulations are independent of the initial conditions as\nwe have discarded the first transient to allow enough time\nfor the system to fall into the stationary solution \u2014the\nonly exception is fig. 2(a) where the noises intensities are\nextremely weak, as indicated in the caption.\n 0\n 0.5\n 1\n\u2212\u03c0 0 \u03c0\nF\nDP\n\u03a6\n\u2212\n(a)\n\u2212\u03c0 0 \u03c0\n\u03a6\n\u2212\n(b)\n\u2212\u03c0 0 \u03c0\n\u03a6\n\u2212\n(c)\nFig. 2: (Colour on-line) Influence of the intensities of common\nnoise on coupling-induced synchronisation.

For the\nsimulations corresponding to (a), the system stays within a\nsmall interval of \u03c6\u2212: due to the weakness of the noises, it does\nnot attain the stationary solution.

Note that\nmA1\u2212nA2 = 0 in all three plots.\nHaving derived the above optimization requirement for\nthe ratio of A1 and A2, we now explore the influence of\ntheir values. From the exponent in (15) we can study the\ncompetition between coupling and common noise. When\nthe \u201ceffective coupling\u201d \u03b5+ is big compared to A1A2, more\nspecifically \u03b5+ >nmA1A2\/2, the exponent is positive, so\nthe probability density will have its maximum at \u03c6\u2212 = \u03c0.\nIf the product A1A2 increases, the bracket in (15) will\ndepend more strongly on \u03c6\u2212 thereby tending to enhance\nsynchronisation. However, the exponent will be smaller,\nthus flattening the probability density and tending to\nhinder synchronisation. As (15) is more sensitive to the\nsecond effect than to the first, we conclude that, in the case\nof coupling-induced synchronisation, larger noise intensi-\nties (either common or non-common) hinder synchronisa-\ntion, as is evident in fig. 2.\nWhen \u03b5+ <nmA1A2\/2, we enter a different regime:\ncommon-noise\u2013induced synchronisation. Because the\nexponent in (15) is negative, the probability density will\nhave a maximum at \u03c6\u2212 = 0. In contrast to the previous\ncase, large values of A1A2 are now beneficial in that: the\n\u03c6\u2212-dependent term inside the bracket then dominates\nover the other terms; and they increase the absolute value\nof the exponent (we still assume \u03b5+ > 0), see fig. 3; also,\ncompare figs. 1(c) and (a). We can have very narrow peaks\nin the probability density, and correspondingly strong\n30005-p4\nCompetition between noise and coupling in the induction of synchronisation\n 0\n 0.5\n 1\n\u2212\u03c0 0 \u03c0\nF\nDP\n\u03a6\n\u2212\n(a)\n\u2212\u03c0 0 \u03c0\n\u03a6\n\u2212\n(b)\n\u2212\u03c0 0 \u03c0\n\u03a6\n\u2212\n(c)\nFig. 4: (Colour on-line) Synchronisation decreases with the\nintensity of the effective coupling, when it is induced by\ncommon noise.

In\nthis regime of common-noise\u2013induced synchronisation,\na bigger value of the effective coupling \u03b5+ will result in\nan exponent that is smaller in absolute value: smaller\nvalues for the couplings between the oscillators are better\nfor common-noise\u2013induced synchronisation, as shown in\nfig. 4. The origin of this competition between coupling\nand common noise is that each effect tends to push the\nsystem into synchronising at a different value of \u03c6\u2212.\nCommon noise locks the system at around \u03c6\u2212 = 0, and\nthe coupling term \u03b5+ sin\u03c6\u2212 pushes the system away\nfrom \u03c6\u2212 = 0. In general, we must expect there to be\ncompetition between coupling and common noise; the\nexception is the very special case where both agents tend\nto push the system into synchronising near same value\nof \u03c6\u2212.\nConclusions. \u2013 We have studied phase synchro-\nnisation between two oscillators in the general case,\nencompassing both couplings and noise. There are two\ndifferent routes to synchronisation: either via coupling\nor via common noise. Where one mechanism induces\nsynchronisation, the other hinders it, corresponding to\nthe existence of competition between them. In princi-\nple, this result allows us to distinguish coupling- and\ncommon-noise\u2013induced synchronisation: e.g. in the\ncardiorespiratory interaction, stronger noise yields weaker\nsynchronisation [14], so that the route to synchronisation\nhere is apparently via couplings. A striking consequence\nof this competition is that, for the common noise scenario,\nan increase in coupling inhibits synchronisation: here, the\neffective coupling should ideally be as small as possible.\n\u2217 \u2217 \u2217\nWe acknowledge valuable discussions with\nT.
