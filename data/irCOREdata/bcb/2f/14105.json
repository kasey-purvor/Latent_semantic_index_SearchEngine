Particular attention is paid\nto the experiences of campus-based students outside formal classroom interactions in self-directed\nstudy. Self-directed learning (SDL) is \u2018a form of study in which learners have the primary respon-\nsibility for planning, carrying out and evaluating their own learning experiences\u2019 (Merriam and\nCaffarella 1991, 41). SDL occurs in both informal and formal learning situations and typical activ-\nities include peer discussion and collaboration, accessing library resources, reading, research and\ndevelopment and working through tutorial materials and workbooks. Within formal academic\nprogrammes in the UK, hours are allocated to self-directed study in addition to hours for lectures\nand seminar attendance. These hours are quantified in quality assurance documents and typically\nconstitute a substantial proportion of an academic programme. We were, therefore, interested in\ninvestigating how students were using technology during this time, which is, at least notionally,\nat the disposal of the students. There is an expectation on the part of the higher education institution\nthat students use the time for studying in depth and preparing their coursework. For the student\nthis notional time is under threat. The threats can come externally from the demands of income\ngeneration to cover fees and living expenses, social pressures and an overloaded curriculum,\n*Corresponding author. Email: f.deepwell@coventry.ac.uk\n6  F. Deepwell and S. Malik\ntogether with a declining staff:student ratio. However, there are also internal factors, such as\nlearner motivation, preparedness to study and conceptions of their student identity that affect how\nstudents approach SDL.\nIn an environment where solutions are sought to deal with the new mass higher education\ncommunity, e-learning (in all its forms and blends) is seen as having potential. There is now\nunprecedented access to learning resources and information, data analysis and creative soft-\nware, communication and collaborative technologies in support of learning in higher educa-\ntion. As e-learning practice develops as a field of inquiry distinct from distance and open\nlearning and beyond \u2018projects by innovators\u2019 (Salmon, 2005), we are starting to discover more\nabout how to embed technology, how to design and assess learning tasks, how to motivate\nparticipation and encourage co-construction of knowledge. Until recently, much of the\nresearch has been practitioner-led rather than from the perspective of the learners (Sharpe\net al. 2005). However, the JISC is funding a UK research programme to explore the learner\nexperiences of e-learning which is now producing interesting accounts of the student experi-\nence across higher education, further education and adult and community education.1 This\nresearch programme is also developing new and robust methodologies for researching this\ncomplex field of inquiry. The present study explores a sub-section of the student learning\nexperience, namely how learners make use of technology to further their independent learning\nwithin formal programmes of study and the role that academic colleagues and the institution\nplays in supporting such use.\nWe propose that the use of technology, both for campus-based and distance learners, requires\na level of self-direction similar to SDL. This is particularly so in an increasingly blended learning\ndelivery of higher education. The individual has to take the initiative and responsibility for what\nthey select, manage and access in a limited time outside formal contact hours. Therefore, some of\nthe research questions we wanted to explore in this study were: what is the reality of SDL for\nstudents today; how has learning technology pervaded out-of-class study time; who supports the\nlearner in making sense of the technologies and what needs do they have; what expectations are\nthere of academic colleagues in supporting SDL?\nThe present research attempts to explore these aspects, namely the use of technology that\nstudents on higher education courses make use of in their learning outside classroom activities.\nTo understand more about some of these issues we conducted two focus groups, a survey and a\nnumber of in-depth follow-up interviews. A purposive sample of students studying at undergrad-\nuate and postgraduate level from a cross-section of departments and at different stages in their\nacademic programmes was selected for the collection of survey data.\nBackground\nIncreasingly over the past decade the learning experience of students in higher education in the\nUK is one that is mediated, at least in part, by technology. Institutions have invested heavily in\nestablishing a robust and integrated technical infrastructure not only to support their own admin-\nistration functions, but also to enable computing access, e-mail communication, online informa-\ntion systems and virtual learning environments (VLEs). At the same time academic colleagues\nare increasingly expected, and in some cases required, to use the institutional technologies in\norder to deliver their teaching. In the UK by 2005 over 95% of institutions of higher education\nsupported a VLE (Sharpe et al. 2006) and the term \u2018blended learning\u2019 is now commonly used to\nrefer to the mix of face-to-face and e-learning that constitutes the higher education experience of\nstudents. There are many reasons for the growth in the use of learning technologies cited in the\nliterature (for example: to manage larger numbers of students on modules; to serve the needs of\na more diverse student population; the management imperative to become competitive in the new\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology  7\nonline markets), however, there is still uncertainty over the impact of the introduction of technol-\nogies, as Bonk, Kim and Zeng outlined: \nThe promises (and, hopefully, the benefits) of blended learning are extensive. For instance, some\npromote increased learning, others point to the reduction in the need for brick and mortar, and still\nothers allude to engagement, collaboration, success, ownership, and higher quality learning. Further\nresearch and innovation in the blended learning arena will help sort out the key contributions,\nbenefits, and impact areas. (Bonk, Kim, and Zeng 2004)\nAcross the world there has been an upsurge in the use of learning technology in higher education,\nalthough the technologies themselves may vary, from video-conferencing to websites, CD ROMs\nand mobile phones. The prevailing technologies in the UK throughout the early 2000s, the VLEs,\nare characterized by the control that the lecturers have in shaping the online environment. More\nrecently, however, the dominance of institutional VLEs has started to give way to more person-\nalized, collaborative and student-centred environments made possible by Web 2.0 technologies,\nwhere the monitoring and surveillance aspects of VLEs (Land and Bayne 2005) give way to\nthe individual control and personalization of technologies.\nIn this changing and complex higher education context learning technology has been the\nsubject of much funded research in the UK (funded by JISC, the EU eLearning Initiative, the\nHigher Education Academy, to name but a few). With the ability to track aspects of student\nusage and the enthusiastic engagement of innovative lecturers it was hoped that some of the\nmore elusive questions around the embedding of technology in learning might be answered.\nResearch into the use by lecturers of e-learning has increased our understanding of pedagogy\n(Oliver 2006). In part this has been because the technology makes explicit the teaching, learn-\ning and assessment aspects that normally remain implicit, and unarticulated, except within a\nteam delivering a shared module. This research has largely been from the perspective of tutor-\nled online material and activities, including the use of \u2018learning activity management systems\u2019\n(Sharpe et al. 2006). The research literature focuses on the materials which are made available\nto students and how learners interact with set tasks, such as online discussions or group assign-\nments. There have been many studies of distance learning and of informal learning, but reviews\nof the literature have identified gaps in studies into students\u2019 experiences of blended learning,\ni.e. of formal courses where there is a combination of face-to-face teaching and online activi-\nties (Sharpe et al. 2005). A recent set of studies commissioned by JISC are addressing this gap\nby focusing exclusively on the learners\u2019 experiences, for example the qualitative study of the\nlearner experience of e-learning.2 In this inquiry the research team derived five higher order\ncategories, namely life, formal learning, technology, people and time. Within each category\nwere five influencing factors: control, identity, feelings, relationships and abilities (Creanor\net al. 2006, 23). These categories and influencing factors are derived from narrative accounts of\nlearner experiences, prompted by mediating artefacts, and represent a rich account of the\nlearner perspective, crossing over the boundaries between formal and informal learning and\neducational sectors. The present case study specifically explores the part played by self-\ndirected study for students on campus-based programmes, since this constitutes a substantial\nproportion of the time learners in higher education are studying and remains largely under-\nresearched. It is hoped that this present case study will complement recent learner-centred\nstudies and provide some further insights into the expectations and behaviour of learners with\nregard to e-learning outside classroom activities.\nMethodology\nThe case study was carried out in early 2007, after receiving approval from the University Ethics\nCommittee. The purpose of the research was to gain a greater understanding of patterns,\n8  F. Deepwell and S. Malik\nmotivations and engagement with learning technology amongst students learning on campus on\ntraditionally delivered academic programmes.\nCase study is a research approach that investigates real-life phenomena which can be based\non qualitative and quantitative evidence (Stake 1995). Case study research is looking for partic-\nularization rather than generalization. Methods employed in this study included focus group\nresearch, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with students. Coventry University has a\nrelatively long tradition in using learning technology to support campus-based learning; all\nacademic courses and modules at this institution have been supported by an institutional VLE\nsince 1999. Usage of the VLE and associated technologies is widespread, thereby making this a\nsuitable site to investigate the topic.\nIn scoping the inquiry two focus groups were held in order to understand the issues from a\nstudent perspective and thus inform the questionnaire design. Most of the survey questions were\nclosed choices, with just three open-ended questions at the end which explored the likes and\ndislikes of learning technologies. The questionnaire was tested prior to the launch, which was in\nMarch\/April 2007. Around 240 students were taken as a purposive sample for collection of data\nthrough the survey. The students were studying at undergraduate and postgraduate levels from a\ncross-section of departments. Table 1 shows the spread of responses, which were distributed and\ncollected in class, with the cooperation of the respective lecturers. The chosen method of distri-\nbution increases the proportion of completed questionnaires in each class group, although some\nstudents in each group chose not to participate in the research, so of 267 questionnaires, 237 were\nreturned (89%).\nThe student demographic was mixed in terms of gender (55% male, 45% female), ethnicity\n(50% white, 22% black, 19% Asian and 8% Chinese), status (55% home students, 45% overseas\nstudents). Less than 1% (n = 14) declared a disability. The age range was between 18 and 64 years\nold, with just over half of the students (54%) in the 22\u201329 years old category.\nSemi-structured follow-up interviews took place on campus with students from these groups\nwho were willing to assist further in the research. An inductive, interpretivist analysis of the tran-\nscripts of the interviews was carried out by the two researchers independently, using a relatively\nsimple mark-up procedure to identify themes in the student narratives. The themes were then\ndiscussed, clustered and agreed within the research team and subsequently validated through further\nanalysis of the survey results, including the responses to the open-ended questions from the survey.\nPreliminary findings\nOverall, the responses from the survey indicate that the students were in favour of using learning\ntechnologies to support them in their studies, with around 80% of the sample agreeing that the\nTable 1.

Sixty-four per cent agreed that learning technology has positive effects\non their attitudes towards learning independently.\nIn terms of time spent on independent, self-directed learning, 10% of students in the survey\nreported spending over 21 hours per week and 47% between 11 and 20 hours per week. Thirty-\nthree per cent reported spending between 5 and 10 hours and the remaining 10% spent under\n4 hours per week. These UK findings closely match those of the US National Survey of Student\nEngagement, 2004, reported in Herrington, Reeves, and Oliver (2006, 100), which reported that\nof 163,000 students only \n11 per cent of full-time students spend more than 25 hours a week studying outside their classes \u2013 the\nminimum number of hours academic staff expect students to study to be successful. A disappointing\n44 percent of students surveyed reported studying less than 10 hours a week.\nWhilst the context and scale of these two studies are different, there is close correspondence in\nthe proportion of time that students spent on their independent learning.\nMost of the use of technology is reported to be to access information (76%) or review course\nmaterials (73%), manage course information (65%) and communicate with friends (59%). Fifty-\nthree per cent used technology for collaborative tasks and 45% of the students used it for self-\nassessment exercises. Less use appears to have been made of technologies to contact lecturers\n(39%) or other students (34%) or to revise for examinations (38%). This is shown graphically in\nFigure 1.\nFigure 1. Summary of student responses on technology uses for self-directed learningThe behaviours reported by students in this study differ in this respect from the recent learner\nexperience study by Conole et al. (2006, 156), which found \u2018a marked lack of enthusiasm for\nVLEs\u2019. In the present study the VLE was regarded as the first reference point for e-learning and\nwas in general appreciated by students, although there are some issues arising with regard to the\nway in which the online environment is being used, which we discuss later in this article.\nOverall, there appears to be little differentiation of response amongst students by gender, age,\nstatus or ethnic background. One area where some variation can be found is amongst usage by\nyear of study, for example, only 26% of first year students, compared with 51% of respondents\nin other years, used the online library on a daily or weekly basis.\n76\n73\n65\n59\n53\n45\n39\n38\n34\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\naccessing information\nreviewing course materials\nmanaging course information\ncommunicating with friends\ncollaborative tasks\nself-assessment exercises\ncontacting lecturers \nrevising for exams\ncontacting other students\nPercentage of responses\nFigure 1. Summary of student responses on technology uses for self-directed learning.\n10  F. Deepwell and S. Malik\nInitial themes, derived from the interviews and the survey, include insights into student\nexpectations of what the technology can facilitate and what the lecturers should be doing. Another\narea that has emerged is the students\u2019 transition from a previous learning environment into their\ncurrent stage of learning, which revealed emotional dimensions to the learning experience with\ntechnologies. Each of these themes will now be discussed.\nDiscussion\nStudent expectations of technology for learning\n\u2018It has just made life easier and so much more enjoyable.\u2019\nInterviews with learners show the prevalence of the belief amongst students from a range of\ncourses that e-learning is helpful. Although it might have been expected, this is supported by the\nsurvey results, where students cite numerous technologies that they use frequently, including\nCUOnline, the University\u2019s virtual learning environment. Seventy-six per cent of respondents\nused CUOnline for their self-directed learning and a slightly smaller majority (65%) used learn-\ning technology to communicate with lecturers.\nStudents were asked to identify from a selection of activities what types of interaction they\nwould like to have more of in their self-directed learning time. Most popular, with 71% selecting\nthe option, was online discussion. Fifty-six per cent wanted more collaborative group work, 40%\nwanted interactive exercises, just 22% games and 17% simulations.\nIn response to a selection of skills they found the technologies most useful in developing,\ncreative thinking was the most popular choice (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2. What kind of skills are technologies most useful for developing?Although learners welcomed online materials as an enhancement, the survey also indicates\nthat students preferred face-to-face communication; 45% of respondents placed great value on\nface-to-face learning. This was also backed up by the interview data, for example, the comment\nby one interviewee: \nBut my issue is: its very good all this online learning but having somebody standing by my side is\nmore beneficial. You get the personal feedback if you\u2019re just stuck or having real difficulty.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\nCritical\nthinking\nProblem-\nsolving\nRote learning Analytical\nthinking\nCreative\nthinking\nFigure 2. What kind of skills are technologies most useful for developing?\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology  11\nThis leads on to the next theme emerging from the data, namely what the expectations are of\nlecturers.\nStudent expectations of lecturers for facilitating learning through technology\nOur analysis so far has revealed contradictory expectations by students of the role of the lecturer\nin facilitating student learning through technology. Whilst the students did seem to be applying\nthemselves adequately in terms of time spent on independent study, as reported in the preliminary\nfindings above, and wanting more technology-based activities in their courses, they did not seem\nto be working on their studies independently. There appears to be a strong reliance on the module\ntutors for information and guidance on learning at all levels of study.\nThe interviews revealed variations in the amount of guidance offered by lecturers. Whilst one\nstudent (performing arts, year 1) reported that she and her student peers had to work out for them-\nselves what and how to study, another (engineering management, postgraduate) had been\nprovided with a workbook that offered highly detailed guidance on weekly activities, similar to\nthat expected on a distance learning course. Within this range of tutor direction other support\nmechanisms were also mentioned. For instance, one of the students \u2018couldn\u2019t praise the library\nstaff highly enough; couldn\u2019t fault them\u2019 in their level of support for her, and yet she did not see\nthis as providing sufficient support in the module and more face-to-face encounters were wanted\nwith the lecturers.\nAmongst the students interviewed there was a high expectation of almost instant tutor feed-\nback, and frustration when this was not received. The lecturers were the first resort for assistance,\nand only when they were unavailable did the students report turning to other sources of help with\ntheir learning, e.g. their friends, colleagues on the course and others. For example, one student\n(information technology for engineers, postgraduate) regretted the fact that the lecturer was not\nonline simultaneously with the student when he logged on at midnight. In these circumstances he\nhad to contact his friends for advice.\nAnother indication of student reliance on lecturing staff is the declared dependence on the\nsupplied reading. For example, one student stated that the most useful independent learning\nstrategy for him was to read the handouts and books provided by the lecturer. In order to pass the\nmodule it was felt sufficient by another student to read the directed reading, although he also\nacknowledged that to get a good mark more independent research through the library portal was\nrequired.\nFurther contradictions emerge with respect to contact with lecturers. On the one hand,\nstudents felt that the computer was being used as a substitute for contact. As one student put it:\n\u2018CUOnline is fine but sometimes it\u2019s nice to talk to a person instead of a computer\u2019. They reported\nthat they wanted feedback from lecturers regularly, yet only a relatively low number of the\nrespondents (23%) contacted their lecturers on a weekly basis. Also, the students in the interviews\nreported that they did get feedback if they asked for it. However, it appears from both the survey\ndata and the interviews that feedback received via e-mail or CUOnline does not have as high a\nvalue placed on it as face-to-face feedback.\nThe final point with regard to student expectations relates to how much the lecturers engaged\nwith learning technologies. When asked in the survey what improvements they would like to see\nwith regard to learning technologies many of the students wanted lecturers to place more infor-\nmation in CUOnline. There was also a call for more direction from the lecturers about what to do\nin the online space. One of the students recounted how the online systems were presented at the\nstart of his course and \u2018looked really good\u2019, but he then found that the lecturers supporting the\npart-time course he was on did not make use of it and it was \u2018just an empty web page\u2019. These\naccounts of student experiences suggest a need for the development of metacognitive skills and\n12  F. Deepwell and S. Malik\nmanagement of learner expectations and, at the same time, a need for greater consistency of usage\nacross educational programmes.\nUsing technologies to ease transition\n\u2018I\u2019m not afraid of learning if I know the direction.\u2019\nThere appears to be a further issue around the provision of guidance in the use of learning tech-\nnology, relating to the process of transition. There was evidence of this in the shift from college\/\nschool into university, as well as from employment onto postgraduate courses.\nThe interview data reveal the wide-ranging expectations and needs of first year students\ntoward the university experience as a whole. Students reflected on their prior learning experiences\nas compared with university: \u2018I find it very strange, coming from a very structured kind of life at\ncollege, coming to university is very, very strange\u2019 and \u2018It\u2019s different from high school you don\u2019t\nget a lot of help from teachers\u2019. Another student had come to study after years working in an\nindustrial environment where he had been coached in time management, research skills and prior-\nitizing assignments. He found that his expertise in these metacognitive skills meant that he was\nprepared for the course, although he wondered how others coming directly from education were\nmanaging, since the part-time postgraduate course did not to him seem to provide development\nin these skills.\nOverall, the students felt that more support should be provided to ease the transition, although\nthe students were not very clear what this should comprise. The interviews revealed a reliance on\nthe support of friends to help them through identified crisis moments.\nWith regard to learning technology, there appears not to be a skills deficit (e-mail, web-\nsearching, chat). The reported skill levels from the survey are encouragingly high, with 95% of\nrespondents rating their skill level in using technology for self-directed learning as intermediate\nor above, leaving just 5% as beginners. However, there appears to be a lack of orientation in the\nuse of the learning technologies preferred by the university, including confusion over how to use\nthe new CUOnline, the library portal for e-journals and an ePortfolio system (PebblePad) for\npersonal development planning.\nConclusions and further work\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what we would do without it \u2026 to be honest.\u2019\nWithin the context of this study we have explored the experiences of students in relation to their\nuse of learning technology on campus-based courses. The focus on self-directed learning has been\nhelpful in drawing attention to what students are actually doing when they study, rather than to\nwhat they feel they should be doing. This focus enabled us to highlight three themes: student\nexpectations of technology, of their lecturers\u2019 use of technology and the role of technology in\neasing the transition stages of learning. Within each of these themes we have identified implica-\ntions for the institution, the lecturers and the students.\nThe number of hours spent on self-directed study is reportedly quite good for the majority\nof students (although self-reporting of estimated time is not a true measure) and the skill levels\nto work with technology are largely present. However, there seems to be a lack of direction in\nwhat they are meant to be doing in this self-directed time and there is frequent mention of the\nrole of the lecturers in determining the activities that are undertaken. This suggests that we are\nsome way from Merriam and Caffarella\u2019s (1991) notion of self-directed learning, where the\nlearner takes responsibility for their own studies. It also highlights the crucial role that tutors\nplay in the learning process at this university, whether face-to-face or mediated by technology.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology  13\nInterestingly, this was also the case where a detailed study pack was provided. The key to this\nappears to be the high importance given to lecturer feedback. Feedback tells students how\nsuccessfully they have tackled their academic work. It also provides an indication of the quality\nof their work and raises motivation among students towards their learning. We have found,\nhowever, that learners appear to have high expectations of the speed at which lecturers can\nprovide feedback to students and the detail included and these expectations are perhaps not\nmanaged sufficiently within the blended learning process, which still accounts mainly for face-\nto-face \u2018contact hours\u2019. There is also perhaps a case for developing a greater appreciation of\nonline feedback.\nThe research furthermore indicates that there is a need for more direct guidance on what and\nhow to use technology for learning more independently. The significance here is that this advice\nis appreciated and acted upon by students if it comes from course tutors (as distinct from librari-\nans, for example). Where this plays out most appears to be in the transition stages of learning.\nStudents need help in adapting to university life and becoming autonomous learners. Pitkethly\nand Prosser\u2019s (2001) research into the \u2018first-year experience\u2019 advocated that universities need to\nunderstand the specific needs of their learners and develop appropriate courses of action. Our\nresearch implies that these needs are present at different stages in the learning cycle, not just in\nthe first year. With regard to learning technology usage, our analysis is starting to indicate what\nmight be a useful line of development.\nIn this paper we have presented some of the findings of our study. We were attempting to gain\na greater understanding of what the reality of SDL is for students today. In this we have explored\nstudents\u2019 expectations of the technology itself, the role of the tutor and a particular aspect of the\nlearning experience in higher education, namely transition. The use of technology is pervasive,\nbut the use of technologies for learning is more problematic and there is a need to clarify how\nstudents are using them successfully and creatively in order to give a sense of which direction to\ntake for those who are still finding their way.\nIt is hoped that the findings of this study will suggest some guidelines for students about the\nuse of available learning technologies. Another outcome of the study will be guidelines to lectur-\ners in improving the opportunities for students to use learning technology in their self-directed\nlearning.\nNotes\n1.
