We perform a superposed epoch study of the effects of ICME-dominated and CIR-dominated solar wind on particle precipitation during geomagnetic storms. We use data from a set of 38 CIR events and 33 ICME events. Particle precipitation is inferred from cosmic noise absorption (CNA) recorded by the riometer at Abisko. The electron flux intensity at geosynchronous orbit close to the location of the riometer is taken from the synchronous orbit particle analyzer (SOPA) onboard the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) satellite LANL-01A. The results show that mean CNA is more intense during the main phase of ICME-driven storms. In contrast, mean CNA remains elevated for a much longer period during CIR-driven storms indicating prolonged periods of particle precipitation.

Introduction\n[2] Interaction between the solar wind and the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetosphere can cause disturbances in the geomagnetic\nfield. The solar wind parameters that affect the level of\ngeomagnetic activity are the solar wind velocity (v) and the\nsouthward oriented component of the interplanetary mag-\nnetic field (IMF) in GSM coordinates (Bs) [e.g., Gonzalez\nand Tsurutani, 1987; Gosling et al., 1991; Gonzalez et al.,\n1999; Borovsky and Denton, 2006; Tsurutani et al., 2006,\nand references therein].\n[3] Two solar wind structures have been identified as the\nimportant drivers of geomagnetic storms; interplanetary\ncoronal mass ejections (ICME) and corotating interaction\nregions (CIR) [e.g., Richardson et al., 2000].\n[4] ICMEs are the interplanetary (IP) counterpart of\nmassive eruptions of magnetized solar plasma. Typically,\nan ICME is composed of an interplanetary shock wave, a\nsheath region of compressed solar wind and an ejecta [e.g.,\nGopalswamy, 2003]. The configuration of the magnetic\nfield in the sheath and the ejecta can lead to enhanced Bs.\nAlmost all shocks observed at 1 astronomical unit (AU) are\nassociated with an ICME [Sheeley et al., 1985], a feature\nshown to enhance geomagnetic effects [Gosling et al.,\n1991]. However, not all ICMEs are sufficiently fast to drive\na shock [Gosling et al., 1991]. In this paper, geomagnetic\nstorms driven by any combination of an ICME shock,\nsheath or ejecta are termed ICME driven storms.\n[5] CIRs are regions of compressed magnetic field and\nplasma that result from interaction between high-speed and\nslow-speed solar wind streams [e.g., Tsurutani et al., 1995,\n2006]. The fast-solar wind streams typically have speeds of\n\u0002750 to 800 kms\u00011, and emanate from coronal holes,\nwhereas slow-speed streams typically have speeds of\n\u0002300 to 400 kms\u00011, and originate from the streamer belt\nregion [e.g., Tsurutani et al., 2006]. As coronal holes can\npersist for longer than the rotation period of the Sun, the\nhigh-speed streams may reoccur with a frequency of \u000227\ndays. The term CIR is applied to the interaction region and\nthe period of high solar wind speed which follows each\ninteraction region in this paper.\n[6] The likelihood of the solar wind being dominated by\neither an ICME or CIR structure is dependent on the level\nof solar activity [e.g., Tsurutani et al., 1995; Gonzalez et\nal., 1999; Richardson et al., 2000, 2001]. CIRs usually\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, A06205, doi:10.1029\/2007JA012752, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University,\nLancaster, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JA012752$09.00\nA06205 1 of 12\noccur during the declining phase of solar activity. ICMEs\noccur throughout the entire solar cycle but are more frequent\nin the period around solar maximum [e.g., St. Cyr et al.,\n2000].\n[7] Features of geomagnetic storms have been observed\nto exhibit different characteristics dependent on the solar\nwind driver [e.g., Tsurutani et al., 2006; Borovsky and\nDenton, 2006; Denton et al., 2006]. CIR-driven storms\nare more likely to occur following an extended period of\ngeomagnetic calm than ICME-driven storms [Borovsky and\nDenton, 2006, and references therein] where a period of\ncalm is defined as Kp \u0003 1+ over one to two days. Borovsky\nand Denton [2006] have shown that ICMEs have a greater\ninfluence over the ring current than CIRs while CIRs have\nthe greater influence over magnetospheric convection,\nwhich can measured using the Kp index [Bartels et al.,\n1939; Thomsen, 2004]. The density and temperature of\nparticles at geosynchronous orbit also exhibit different\nprofiles during storms depending on the solar wind driver\n[Denton et al., 2006].\n[8] One manifestation of geomagnetic activity is the\nprecipitation of particles trapped in the magnetosphere into\nthe ionosphere in the auroral zone. Variation of ionospheric\ncharacteristics can have implications for High Frequency\n(HF) communication [e.g., Kavanagh et al., 2004]. Precip-\nitation of energetic electrons (E > 30 keV) in the D-region\nof the ionosphere can be inferred through measurement of\nthe level of absorption of cosmic radio noise (CNA)\nduring propagation through the ionosphere by ground-\nbased riometers.\n[9] The passage of geomagnetically effective ICMEs and\nCIRs can provide a number of driving mechanisms for\nenhanced electron precipitation [e.g., Longden et al., 2007].\nSubstorms, a feature common to all geomagnetic storms\n[e.g., Gonzalez et al., 1994] are known to drive precipitation\n[e.g., Hargreaves et al., 1975; Ranta et al., 1981]. This\nprecipitation is linked to the injection of particles at the time\nof substorm onset, with CNA observed around local mid-\nnight at the time of the initial injection and CNA observed\nin the local morning as the injected particles drift and\nharden [e.g., Stauning, 1996]. Precipitation can also be\ncaused by rapid compression of the magnetosphere resulting\nfrom changes in the incident solar wind pressure (Pdyn)\n[Brown et al., 1961, 1972; Brown and Driatsky, 1973;\nPerona, 1972]. Changes in Pdyn can be driven by solar\nwind features such as IP shocks and regions of high density.\nKavanagh et al. [2004] have shown that CNA is dependent\non the same solar wind parameters as geomagnetic activity,\nnamely v and Bs. CNA has been observed to reoccur with a\n27 day period during the declining phase of solar activity\n[Hultqvist, 1966 and references therein] implying a link\nbetween CIR activity and CNA.\n[10] The aim of the current study is to compare the\nmagnetospheric response in terms of electron precipitation\nduring ICME-driven and CIR-driven storms. We perform a\nsuperposed epoch analysis on riometer data during 33\nICME-driven and 38 CIR-driven storms. A broad correla-\ntion has previously been shown between energetic electron\nflux at geosynchronous orbit and CNA during substorms\n[e.g., Parks et al., 1968; Baker et al., 1981] and riometer\nmeasurements have been used to identify substorm activity\n[Spanswick et al., 2007]. We use electron flux intensity data\nfrom the synchronous orbit particle analyzer (SOPA) instru-\nment [Belian et al., 1992] onboard one of the Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory (LANL) satellites at geosynchronous\norbit to enable investigation of the relationship between this\nand CNA throughout the development of a storm.\n2. Instrumentation\n[11] Energetic electron precipitation is inferred from CNA\ndata from the widebeam riometer located at Abisko, Sweden\n(68.40\u0001N, 18.90\u0001E geographic). This riometer operates at\n30 MHz and is part of the chain of riometers operated by the\nSodankyla\u00a8 Geophysical Observatory (SGO). Between 2000\nand 2006, the riometer at Abisko mapped to an L shell of\n\u00025.81 to \u00025.85 and had a magnetic latitude in the range\n\u000265.30\u0001N to \u000265.37\u0001N. Magnetic latitudes are given the\nCorrected Geomagnetic (CGM) coordinate system using the\nInternational Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model\n[e.g., Maus et al., 2005].\n[12] Electron flux intensity data are taken from the SOPA\ninstrument onboard the LANL-01A satellite located in\ngeosynchronous orbit. LANL-01A was located at a geo-\ngraphic longitude between 7.6\u0001E and 9\u0001E during these\nevents and ostensibly maps to an L shell of 6.6. During\n2000 to 2006, the footprint of a geomagnetic field line\nmapped from the equator at 6.6 RE at the longitude of the\nLANL-01A satellite using the Tsyganenko 89C model\n[Tsyganenko, 1995] was around 67\u0001N. The SOPA instru-\nment records electrons with energies in the range 50 keV to\n\u0002 26 MeV over 16 energy channels.\n[13] Observations of the solar wind conditions at the L1\npoint during the events are taken from the magnetic fields\nexperiment (MAG) instrument [Smith et al., 1998] and the\nSolar Wind Electron Proton Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM)\ninstrument [McComas et al., 1998] onboard the Advanced\nComposition Explorer (ACE) satellite. The parameters\nselected to indicate solar wind conditions were vx and Bz\n(GSM), due to their influence on the strength of the\ninterplanetary convective field, and vy (a measure of the\neast-west velocity of the solar wind. A change from west-\nerly direction (\u0001) to an easterly direction (+) is a typical\nsignature of a CIR event.\n3. Data Analysis\n3.1. Event Selection\n[14] Candidate ICME events were initially selected from\nthe list of ICMEs compiled by Cane and Richardson\n[2003]. This list covers the period from 1996 to 2002. Data\nare available from the LANL-01A satellite from October\n2000 and events occurring before this time were not used in\nthis study. Additional ICME events occurring between 2002\nand 2006 were identified from solar wind plasma and IMF\ndata. Candidate CIR events were selected from the list used\nby Denton et al. [2006], covering the period of 1993 to\n2005. These events were selected from a list of east\/west\ndeflections in the solar wind [R. McPherron, private com-\nmunication], with additions based on direct examination of\nsolar wind data. Again, events occurring prior to the\ncoverage of LANL-01A were discarded. ICME and CIR\nevents were also discarded when there was incomplete data\nA06205 LONGDEN ET AL.: ICME- AND CIR-DRIVEN PRECIPITATION\n2 of 12\nA06205\ncoverage during the event, when a subsequent event was\nobserved within 72 h of the time of the onset of the initial\nevent or when no clear minimum in the Dst index was\nobserved following the onset of the event. Applying these\ncriteria resulted in a set of 33 ICME events from 2000 to\n2006 and a set of 38 CIR events from 2003 to 2005 for\nanalysis. The prehistory of the solar wind or background\nconditions in the magnetosphere were not considered.\n3.2. Epoch Analysis\n[15] In this study, geomagnetic activity is inferred from\nthree indices; Dst, Kp and SYM-H. Dst is considered to be a\nmeasure of intensity of the ring current [e.g., Grafe, 1999,\nand references therein] and can be used to categorize storm\nintensity [e.g., Gonzalez et al., 1994]. The Kp index can\nalso be used to categorize storm intensity [e.g., Gosling et\nal., 1991] and is a proxy for the strength of magnetospheric\nconvection. The SYM-H index is a similar measure to the\nDst index but has a 1 min resolution [e.g., Wanliss and\nShowalter, 2006]. The higher resolution means that the\nSYM-H index can be used to investigate geomagnetic\nactivity on a smaller temporal scale, such as sudden\nimpulses (SI) [e.g., Takeuchi et al., 2002].\n[16] For each event, the Dst index was inspected to\nidentify the first clear minimum value following the arrival\nof the solar wind structure at the magnetosphere. The time\nof arrival can be estimated from the solar wind speed and\nthe time of initial observation by the ACE satellite [e.g.,\nKhan and Cowley, 1999] and is typically of the order of\nan hour for ICME and CIR events. Following Denton et al.\n[2006] the first minimum in Dst was used as the zero\nepoch for the event. Data were taken from 24 h prior to\nand 72 h following the zero epoch to cover the period from\nstorm onset through to recovery. Storm intensity was deter-\nmined from the lowest value of Dst observed throughout the\nduration of the storm. Table 1 shows a summary the number\nof storms at each intensity level according to driving struc-\nture. As storms may experience growth in more than one\nphase [e.g.,Kamide et al., 1998], the time of zero epoch is not\nnecessarily the time of minimum Dst. SOPA data with a\ntemporal resolution of 10 s and ACE data with a temporal\nresolution of 64 s were used. Linear interpolation was applied\nto the SOPA and ACE data to ensure consistent timing for\nthese data sets between events.\n[17] We have performed the analysis using data from\nstorms of all intensities and then from storms of weak to\nmoderate intensity only, to enable comparison of precipita-\ntion due to the solar wind driver during similar storm\nconditions.\n[18] Mean values as a function of epoch time were\ncalculated at the sampling rate for each data set for particle\nprecipitation, solar wind parameters and geomagnetic indi-\nces. An estimate for solar wind Pdyn was obtained from the\nproton number density and solar wind velocity data from\nthe ACE satellite.\n4. Results\n[19] The results of the superposed epoch analysis are\nshown in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows the results of\nthe study when data during storms of all intensities are\nconsidered and Figure 2 shows the results for storms of\nweak and moderate intensity only. In both figures, the\npanels show, from top to bottom, the mean electron flux\nintensity of 50\u201375 keV electrons from the LANL-01A\nsatellite, mean absorption from the Abisko riometer, mean\nvx, mean vy and mean IMF Bz from the ACE satellite, mean\nPdyn calculated from ACE data, and mean SYM-H, Kp and\nDst indices as a function of epoch time. A dashed line\nindicating a value of zero is shown for vy and Bz to highlight\nzero crossings. Figures 3 and 4 show the mean data from the\nepoch analysis study for CIR-driven and ICME-driven\nstorms of all intensities respectively with \u00b11 standard devi-\nation indicated by the dashed lines.\n[20] From Figure 1b, mean CNA from the Abisko riom-\neter during ICME-driven storms of all intensities shows an\nincrease from \u000210 h prior to the zero epoch. Two clear\npeaks are also evident in this data; the first \u00021 h prior to the\nzero epoch and the second \u00025 h following the zero epoch.\nFollowing the second peak, mean CNA is observed to decay\nto levels below that observed prior to the zero epoch. Mean\nCNA during CIR-driven storms also shows an increase from\n\u000210 h prior to the zero epoch. This CNA increases\ngradually and then remains elevated throughout the period\nof the study following the zero epoch.\n[21] From Figure 4b, it can be seen that the standard\ndeviation in the magnitude of CNA in ICME events\ndecreases \u000214 h after the zero epoch, around the time that\nthe mean value is seen to decrease. This is consistent with\nless intense precipitation at this time as the mean value of\nCNA and the deviation of intensities away from this mean\nare both reduced. The standard deviation in CNA during\nCIR events (Figure 3b) does not show a marked decrease at\na given time in the development of the storm, also consis-\ntent with enhanced precipitation following the zero epoch.\n[22] The most intense CNA is observed when ICMEs are\nthe dominant structure in the solar wind. However, CNA\nrelated to the passage of a CIR exceeds that related to\nICMEs over a sustained period of time. As a result of the\nsustained enhancement of CNA, total mean absorption\nduring CIR-driven storms slightly exceeds total mean ab-\nsorption during ICME-driven storms over the four day\nperiod of the study.\n[23] When mean CNA during weak and moderate storms\nonly is considered (Figure 2b), the profile during CIR\nevents is largely unchanged. This is unsurprising as only\n1 of the 38 events did not generate storms of these\nintensities. However, the 19 ICMEs that drove a weak or\nmoderate storm produced mean CNA somewhat different to\nthat observed during ICME-driven storms of all intensities.\nMean CNA is lower in magnitude during the lower intensity\nstorms throughout the period of the study. Two peaks\naround 2 h prior to and 5 h following the zero epoch can\nstill be identified but numerous additional peaks of equal\nTable 1.

Also,\nthe peak intensity of CNA during ICME-dominant solar\nwind is of similar magnitude to the peak CNA during CIR-\ndominant solar wind.\n[24] CIRs have a consistent structure; slow solar wind is\nfollowed by an interaction region which is then followed by\na period of fast solar wind. These results highlight the fact\nthat typical CIR-Earth interactions are similar in nature. In\ncontrast, ICME-Earth interactions are all very different in\nnature since they depend on the size, structure, density etc.\nof the associated solar wind structure.\n[25] The general trend in mean 50\u201375 keV electron flux\nintensity closely follows the trend in mean absorption at\nAbisko during CIR-driven storms.

The similarity is less pronounced during\nICME-driven storms although is still somewhat elevated.\nHowever, when storms are considered individually, the\nsignificant correlation between CNA and 50\u201375 keV elec-\ntron flux intensity ranges from highly correlated (r > 0.8) to\nuncorrelated (r \u0005 0) over the four day period for both CIR-\nand ICME-driven storms. It should be noted that geomag-\nnetic activity can alter the mapping of equatorial field lines\n[e.g., Tsyganenko, 1995], affecting the spatial separation\nbetween the riometer at Abisko and the LANL-01A satellite\nFigure 2.

Mean electron flux intensity in the higher\nenergy channels show a similar to profile to that of the 50\u2013\n75 keV channel during CIR-driven storms; relatively low\nflux intensity at the start of the epoch period followed by a\ngradual increase with the onset of activity and sustained\nelevation. However, the time of onset of the increase in\nelectron flux intensity is dependent on the energy of the\nelectrons, with higher energy channels showing an increase\nat a later time than the lower energy channels. The electron\nflux intensity profile shows lower mean flux intensity across\nall channels in the 50\u2013500 keV band prior to the onset of\nCIR-driven storms than prior to ICME-driven storm. The\nsignature of flux dropout is evident around the time of the\nzero epoch for storms driven by both structures. Flux\ndropouts at geosynchronous orbit have been linked to the\ngrowth phase of large geomagnetic substorms or storms\naltering the configuration of the magnetotail [Moldwin et\nal., 1995]. The mean electron flux intensity during ICME-\ndriven storms returns largely to pre-storm levels 1 to 2 days\nafter the zero epoch. The mean flux intensity remains\nelevated during CIR-driven storms, not returning to pre-\nstorm levels before the end of the epoch period (3 days).\nThe elevation of electron flux intensity is clear in all of the\nenergy channels shown.\n[27] Typical signatures of solar wind structures can be seen\nin the trends in the solar wind data used in the superposed\nepoch study. The mean solar wind vx (Figure 1c) steadily\nincreases from a slow speed (\u0002400 kms\u00011) to higher speeds\n(\u0002700 kms\u00011) during CIR events. A rapid elevation in vx\ncan be seen during ICME-dominated solar wind periods\njust prior to the time of zero epoch, followed by a gradual\nreturn to ambient speeds. When compared to the mean\nsolar wind velocity observed during weak and moderate\nICME-driven geomagnetic storms (Figure 2c), the rapid\nincrease around the zero epoch is not evident. This could\nbe an indicator of IP shock activity associated with the\nmore intense ICME-driven storms. Mean vy (Figure 1d) is\naround 0 kms\u00011 during ICME-dominated solar wind. A\nwest to east rotation is evident during CIR-dominated solar\nwind.\n[28] The mean IMF Bz (Figure 1e) is approximately 0 nT\nduring both ICME-driven and CIR-driven storms at all\nFigure 5.

The magnitude of the southward component for\nICME-dominated solar wind is greater than for CIR-dom-\ninated solar wind during storms of all intensities, implying a\ngreater rate of reconnection between the IMF and the\nmagnetosphere under ICME conditions. When periods of\nweak and moderate storm activity only are considered\n(Figure 2e), the southward component has an equal magni-\ntude for both solar wind structures allowing more meaning-\nful comparisons to be made.\n[29] Peaks in mean Pdyn during ICME-dominated solar\nwind are clear 2 to 3 h prior to the zero epoch and 1 to\n2 h following the zero epoch. The initial peak occurs at the\ntime of southward IMF. When storms of weak and moderate\nintensity only are considered (Figure 2f), the peaks in mean\nPdyn become much less pronounced. During CIR-dominated\nsolar wind, mean Pdyn shows a gradual increase prior to the\nzero epoch, around the time of the west to east rotation of the\nsolar wind.\n[30] The profiles in the mean Dst index (Figure 1f) and\nthe mean Kp index (Figure 1g) are as expected since ICME-\ndriven storms, on average, have a more intense signature in\nDst but also show more rapid recovery. CIR-driven storms\nare less intense in terms of Dst and there is no real trend\ntoward recovery within the subsequent 3 days. Peak mean\nKp is greater for ICME-driven storms but mean Kp remains\nelevated over a longer period of time during CIR-driven\nstorms, implying a longer period of magnetospheric con-\nvection [e.g., Denton et al., 2006].\n[31] Table 2 lists a summary of some of the descriptive\nstatistics of the parameters used in this study during CIR-\ndominant and ICME-dominant solar wind. These parame-\nters are taken from the data from the early phase of the\nstorm (from \u00011 day to +1\/2 day of the four day period) and\nfrom the later phase (from +1\/2 day to +3 days of the four\nday period) from the 38 CIR-driven storms and the 33\nICME-driven storms used for the epoch study. From Table 2,\nit can be seen that the most extreme values of the parameters,\nincluding CNA, vx and southward Bz, were observedwhen an\nICME was the dominant structure in the solar wind and the\nmost intense geomagnetic response, in both Dst and Kp, was\ndriven by an ICME. The average values of these parameters\nin the early phase were greater during ICME-driven storms\nand greater range and variation in most parameters is also\nobserved for ICME-driven storms compared to CIR-driven\nstorms. However, in the later phase of the storms the average\nvalues of CNA, vx and Kp are greater when CIRs are the\ndriver of the activity. This demonstrates the persistence of\nactivity following the onset of the storm due to the high-speed\nsolar wind stream following the CIR. The persistence of\nactivity is such that when data from the entire four day period\nof the epoch study is considered, average CNA during CIR-\ndriven storms (\u00020.60 dB) slightly exceeds that observed\nduring ICME-driven storms (\u00020.59 dB).\n5. Discussion\n[32] Solar wind and IMF conditions have a significant\nrole in the occurrence and strength of auroral zone particle\nprecipitation [e.g., Kavanagh et al., 2004]. Solar wind\nparameters that have been linked to driving mechanisms\nof precipitation include velocity, southward oriented IMF\n[e.g., Kavanagh et al., 2004] and dynamic pressure [Brown\net al., 1961]. In addition to a driving mechanism, a\nsufficient population of electrons is required for precipita-\ntion to occur [e.g., Kavanagh et al., 2004]. A number of\nmodels predict the occurrence of CNA from the Kp index\n[e.g., Foppiano and Bradley, 1984, 1985; Hargreaves,\n1966; Kavanagh et al., 2004]. Osepian and Kirkwood\n[2004] found a different response in CNA driven by IP\nshocks based on the background level of Kp prior to the\narrival of the shock.\n[33] The profile of mean CNA at the Abisko riometer\nduring the events selected for the study show that the\npassage of the solar wind structures drives enhanced ener-\ngetic electron precipitation in the auroral zone. However,\nthe profile in CNA differs dependent on the driving struc-\nture. In the early stages of the development of the storm,\nCNA is greater, on average, in ICME events. In the later\nstages of the storm, CNA is stronger during CIR events. It\nappears that the geomagnetic response to the passage of an\nTable 2.

This is confirmed by mean Kp in this epoch\nstudy (Figure 1f). Solar wind velocity also remains elevated\ndue to the persistence of a high-speed stream following the\ncompression region. This means that both enhanced geo-\nmagnetic activity and a solar wind driver for particle\nprecipitation are provided by CIRs over a sustained period.\n[34] Electron precipitation exhibits a diurnal variation\n[e.g., Cowley et al., 1991; Foppiano and Bradley, 1984,\n1985; Hargreaves 1966, 1969; Hargreaves and Cowley,\n1967; Hargreaves et al., 1987; Hartz et al., 1963; Holt et\nal., 1961; Ranta et al., 1981; Kavanagh et al., 2004], with a\nclear minimum in the local evening. Solar wind driving\nmechanisms appear unable to stimulate significant precipi-\ntation at this time. This has been attributed to insufficient\nelectron flux at this local time [e.g., Kavanagh et al., 2004].\nThe diurnal effects are largely removed from the averaged\ndata in the epoch analysis results. Short-duration spikes in\nCNA, such as those driven by substorm activity in the\nmidnight sector, can also be de-emphasized by the averag-\ning process.\n[35] To identify possible diurnal effects, Figure 6 shows\nmean CNA from the riometer at Abisko and mean electron\nflux intensity from the LANL-01A satellite during the 38\nCIR-driven storms and 33 ICME-driven storms used in this\nstudy binned according to Universal Time (UT). In this\nfigure, \u2018\u2018Day 0\u2019\u2019 refers to the day on which storm onset\noccurred and is independent of the time of the first clear\nminimum observed in the Dst index for each event.\n\u2018\u2018Day \u00011\u2019\u2019 is the day prior to the onset of the storm.\n\u2018\u2018Day 1\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018Day 4\u2019\u2019 are the days following the onset of the\nstorm, covering storm development and possible recovery.\nThe magnetic local time (MLT) of the Abisko riometer is\n\u0002UT +2 h 20 min and the MLT of the footprint of LANL-\n01A is \u0002UT +10 min.\n[36] From Figure 6, diurnal variation in CNA and electron\nflux intensity during both CIR-driven and ICME-driven\nstorms is clear. During ICME events, peak CNA is consis-\nFigure 6.

After the onset\nof storm activity, mean CNA is elevated across a wider\nrange of local times. During the recovery phase of the storm,\npeak mean CNA decays. Mean geosynchronous electron\nflux intensity shows isolated, impulsive increases during the\nmain phase of storm activity, including in the local evening.\nHowever, there is no significant increase in the peak mean\ndaytime electron flux intensity with changing activity.\n[37] During the CIR events, mean CNA and mean electron\nflux intensity are low at all local times prior to the onset of\nstorm activity. The effect of the onset of the storm (\u2018\u2018Day 0\u2019\u2019)\nappears to have little effect on these parameters. During the\ndevelopment of the storm and apparent recovery, mean CNA\nand electron flux intensity across all energy channels in the\n50\u2013500 keV range are elevated at all local times compared to\npre-storm levels. This elevation is sustained throughout the\nfour day period considered.\n[38] As CNA and geosynchronous electron flux intensity\nexhibit a local time dependency, the timing of the occur-\nrence of a precipitation event may affect whether it is\ndetected by the riometer and satellite used in this study\nand all precipitation events may not have been observed.\nFurther investigation of precipitation using data from a\nnumber of riometers should provide information about the\nspatial extent of precipitation events and local time effects\nduring CIR- and ICME-driven storms.\n[39] Borovsky and Steinberg [2006] found that 67% of\nCIR-driven storms occurred following a period of geomag-\nnetic calm, compared to 37% of ICME-driven storms. There\nis evidence of this \u2018\u2018calm before the storm\u2019\u2019 in the low value\nof mean CNA and mean geosynchronous electron flux\nintensity prior to the onset of CIR-driven activity in this\nstudy. When storms of all intensities are used, an enhance-\nment in CNA is clear for both CIR events and ICME events\n\u0002 10 h prior to the zero epoch. Before this time, mean CNA\nfor ICME events exceeds that of mean CNA for CIR events.\nAdditionally, mean CNA falls to a level lower than that\nobserved initially. Higher levels of geomagnetic activity are\napparent prior to the zero epoch.\n[40] When storms of all intensities are considered, the\npeaks in CNA at Abisko during ICME-dominated solar\nwind occur around the time of increased in mean Pdyn.\nWhen weak and moderate storms only are considered, both\nthe increased Pdyn and CNA are no longer pronounced. This\nimplies that Pdyn is significant in the occurrence of precip-\nitation during ICME-driven storms. When individual ICME\nevents were investigated, impulses in Pdyn resulting in\ncompression of the magnetosphere seen as impulses in\nthe SYM-H index were identified during some events.\nHowever, it is difficult to identify instances of precipitation\ndirectly driven by impulses in Pdyn (sudden commencement\nabsorption) as often the impulses occurred during a back-\nground of ongoing precipitation.\n6. Conclusions\n[41] The results of the epoch analysis show that there is a\ndifference in particle precipitation during ICME-driven\nstorms when compared to CIR-driven storms:\n[42] (1) When events driving storms of all intensities are\nconsidered, mean CNA is more intense during ICME-driven\nstorms but also shorter-lived. Mean CNA during CIR-driven\nstorms increases gradually and remains elevated over a\nsustained period of time. When events driving an equivalent\nresponse in terms of storm magnitude are compared, mean\nCNA during CIR events is greater in magnitude as well as\nbeing sustained over a longer period, of the order of days,\nthan mean CNA during ICME events.\n[43] (2) Sustained CNA indicates the extended presence\nof driving mechanisms for particle precipitation during CIR-\ndriven storms and a sufficient population of particles. Mean\nelectron flux intensity at geosynchronous orbit for energies\nin the range 50\u2013500 keV are also elevated over a sustained\nperiod during CIR-driven storms. The \u2018\u2018calm before the\nstorm\u2019\u2019 reported by Borovsky and Steinberg [2006] prior to\nthe onset of CIR-driven storms is evident.\n[44] (3) Of the 38 CIR events selected for analysis, 37\nresulted in CIR-driven storms of weak or moderate intensity\nonly when categorized according the Dst index. During\nthese weak and moderate storms, a significant effect on\nparticle precipitation was observed.\n[45] Acknowledgments.
