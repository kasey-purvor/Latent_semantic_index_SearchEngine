This paper is based on her research project dissertation\nAbstract\nThis article reports the findings of an author study at Cranfield\nUniversity. The study investigated authors\u2019 publishing behaviours,\nattitudes, concerns, and their awareness and use of their\ninstitutional repository (IR), Cranfield QUEprints. The findings\nsuggest that despite a reasonable amount of advocacy many\nauthors had not heard of QUEprints and were not aware of its\npurpose. Once explained, all authors saw at least one benefit to\ndepositing a copy of their work to QUEprints, but many were unsure\nhow to deposit, preferring to depend on the Library to do the work.\nThe authors voiced few concerns or conditions regarding the\ninclusion of their work in QUEprints, but felt that it would be an\nextra, inconvenient step in their workload. This research led to the\ndevelopment of the Embed Project which is investigating how to\nembed the IR into the research process, and thereby encourage\nmore authors to deposit their work.\nIntroduction\nCranfield QUEprints is amongst the most successful UK HE\ninstitutional repositories (IRs) in terms of the amount of content.\nHowever, in common with others, its rate of growth is still relatively\nslow. A list of UK HE institutional repositories and statistical data\ncan be found at the Registry of Open Repositories1. Currently,\nQUEprints\u2019 contains just over 1,600 items, and just over 26 per cent\nof these items are preprints or postprints, the majority of which\nwere requested from the author and then deposited by Library staff\nvia a mediated deposit service.\nExperience at Cranfield (and elsewhere2) confirms that making the\nIR available does not necessarily mean that authors will\nautomatically start depositing their work for inclusion. The aim of\nthe research described here was to provide the Library with a\ngreater understanding of the attitudes, behaviours and concerns of\nthe authors from whom they wish to obtain content, and to identify\nthe issues that might either encourage or discourage authors from\nputting their work in QUEprints.\nMethodology\nThe views of 21 authors were obtained using a standardized,\nstructured open-ended interview, which allowed the authors to\nexpress themselves in their own words. Inspiration for the topics\nand issues included in the interview script were formulated from a\ncombination of discussions with the Library managers and from a\nreview of the literature and other author studies on OA publishing\nand IRs3,4,5.\nAdopting the maximum variation sampling strategy6, seven authors\nwere purposefully selected from each of the three academic Schools\nbased on the Cranfield campus of Cranfield University. Among\nthose selected were \u2018early adopters\u2019, identified as individuals who\nhad already sent a relatively high number of papers to be deposited\nin QUEprints. Also selected for interview were authors currently\nholding influential positions within their School; for instance one\ndeputy director of school and two heads of department were\ninterviewed. The remaining 18 authors were selected to represent\nother academic positions at Cranfield: these included two readers,\neight senior lecturers, one lecturer, six senior research fellows and\none research fellow. To maximize the variation between\nparticipants, each of these were selected from a variety of different\nacademic departments and from a variety of different research\nfields.\nThe qualitative data was then analysed adopting the \u2018grounded\ntheory\u2019 approach to data analysis, as described by Paul ten Have7,\nwhereby the authors\u2019 responses were compared and similar answers\nwere then categorized based on the data rather than on any\npreconceived ideas of the interviewer.\nResults analysis\nMotivation for publishing\/sharing work with others\nIt seemed important to gain an understanding of what motivates\nthe authors to publish\/share their work with others and it was\nhoped that by understanding this it might help with the design of\nfuture advocacy of the institutional repository, QUEprints, to\ncoincide with these motivations. The authors were asked:\nWhat is the primary motivation for you publishing\/sharing your\nwork with others? Almost half of the authors (43 per cent) cited\npersonal career progression,19 per cent said it was to share their\nfindings with others and 14 per cent said that it was to be research\nactive for the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE).\nWhen asked directly:\nHas the Research Assessment Exercise influenced where you choose\nto publish?, 76 per cent said that it had and, when probed further:\nWhat has its effect been on your choice?, the majority said that it\nmade them try, wherever possible, to publish their work in the\njournals that have a high impact factor rating in their subject area\nand, interestingly, a couple of the authors said that it had made\nthem focus on publishing in journals with a relatively fast\nturnaround time between when they submit their work and when it\nactually gets published, so as not to miss out on including the paper\nin their Department\u2019s RAE submission. These findings suggest that\nthe influence of the RAE and an author\u2019s personal career\nprogression are powerful motivators both in terms of their reasons\nfor sharing their work and deciding where and how to disseminate\nresearch. For the IR to be successful, it seems logical to assume\nthat it needs to sit comfortably with these motivations.\nCurrent publishing behaviour, and awareness and use of open\naccess dissemination methods\nHaving ascertained their primary motivation for sharing their work,\nthe next questions focused on discovering the methods the authors\nwere currently using to disseminate their work. Eighty-one per\ncent said they shared their last piece of work with others via a\ntraditional refereed journal. When asked:\nHow do you normally share your research with others?\u2019, all the\nauthors mentioned the refereed journal, with the second most\nfrequently cited method being conferences, mentioned by 71 per\ncent of the authors. Able to provide as few or as many methods as\nthey liked, between them the authors identified 20 different ways\nthat they currently share their work with others, including television\nand radio, however only one author spontaneously mentioned using\nthe web to do so. This low mention of the web as a method of\ndisseminating their work was interesting given that when, later in\nthe interview, the authors were asked:\nHave you ever made your work freely available via the web?, almost\nhalf (48 per cent) of the authors said that they had done so, and\napproaching half (43 per cent) of the authors claimed to have had\nwork deposited in QUEprints.\nDespite this limited use of the web to disseminate their own work,\nall the authors said that they use the web to search for the work of\nothers in their field. When asked:\nWhat are your preferred methods?, by far the top two preferred\nmethods were the library\u2019s electronic resources, including alerts\nservices (86%) and Google\/Google Scholar (86%). This suggests\nthat the authors are currently more familiar with using the web to\nfind information than using it to disseminate their own work. It also\nsuggests that although many of the authors had made their work\navailable via the web, it is not their usual method and remains\nrelatively low down their list of choices \u2013 and low in their\nconsciousness.\nHaving asked about their use of the web generally, the authors\nwere then asked: Have you ever published your work in an open\naccess journal? The literature suggests that authors are still fairly\nconservative in their publishing behaviours8, and this question was\nincluded to see how receptive the authors at Cranfield were to\nadopting this alternative publishing model. Although 14 per cent of\nthe authors said they had published work in an open access journal,\nnone of them had paid to do so (claiming that having to pay would\nhave deterred them from doing so), and all of them said that they\nwould not do so again because as far as they were aware, OA\njournals were not highly rated for the RAE. A typical reply was:\n\u2018Yes, but I won\u2019t do it again, because it\u2019s [open access journal] not\ngraded for anything, so there would be no point.\u2019\nAwareness and current use of the institutional repository and \u2018early\nadopters\u2019\nTo gauge the success of current advocacy efforts and to shed light\non any trends regarding motivation for choosing to use QUEprints\nas a dissemination method, authors were asked about their present\nawareness and use of QUEprints. Advocacy methods so far have\nincluded presentations to School Research Committees, reports to\nFaculty Boards, articles in University and Library Service\nNewsletters and support has been gained from some School and\nDepartment Heads to mandate submission among their colleagues9.\nOver half (57 per cent) of the authors said they had heard of\nQUEprints; however, only 43 per cent said they knew what\nQUEprints was. This suggests that hearing about QUEprints does\nnot equate to understanding its purpose. Thus there appears to be\na need for further advocacy to raise awareness of and knowledge\nabout QUEprint\u2019s purpose, although there has been partial success\nin advocacy, as the authors at least recognized the brand, even if\nthey did not necessarily know what the brand stood for.\nHaving found out about awareness and understanding of QUEprints,\nthe next question related to their use of QUEprints:\nHave you ever had any of your own work deposited to QUEprints?\nJust less than half (43 per cent) of the authors said they had sent\nwork for deposit in QUEprints, therefore 25 per cent of the authors\nwho had heard of QUEprints had not yet sent any work for deposit,\nwhich suggests that knowing that QUEprints exists does not\nnecessarily mean that all authors will automatically start depositing\ntheir work for inclusion. This is reflected in the literature10.\nThe research showed that while the authors demonstrated a\nwillingness to deposit work, it was very easy for them to remain\ndetached from their IR. Further research is required to discover\nways of engaging the authors in a more proactive way, and\nembedding the IR within the authors\u2019 work practices.\nConditions and concerns\nClearly, if authors had any concerns that might deter them from\nsending work for deposit, or they had any conditions which they\nwould like to have met before agreeing to send their work for\ndeposit, it was important to find these out and to address them in\nthe design of future advocacy.\nThe authors were asked:\nAre there any conditions you would wish to impose before agreeing\nto deposit\/continuing to deposit your work to QUEprints? Sixty-\nseven per cent of the authors answered \u2018no\u2019 to this question. Of the\n33 per cent of authors who mentioned a condition, ensuring that the\nwork had first been peer-reviewed (43%) and ensuring that\ndepositing work to QUEprints would not upset the publishers with\nwhom they had signed a copyright agreement (29%) were the top\ntwo concerns mentioned. It became clear, as the questions turned\nto asking authors\u2019 views on copyright and on which version of their\nwork they would prefer to see included in QUEprints, that more and\nmore authors expressed similar preferences.\nViews on copyright and version preference\nAuthors expressed more concern about protecting the copyright of\nthe publishers than about their personal copyright. When asked:\nHave you ever discussed retaining your copyright with a publisher?,\none author said they had discussed the issue of retaining copyright\nwith colleagues but none of the authors had ever discussed\nretaining their copyright with the journal publishers; they had\nalways willingly transferred their copyright. This finding is reflected\nin the literature11.\nThe findings suggest that authors placed great value on peer review\nand believed that it should be protected. This became very\napparent when the authors were asked:\nWhich version of your work would you prefer to see included in\nQUEprints? Three options were given from which the authors had\nto choose: preprint (not refereed), refereed preprint (refereed, but\nnot with publisher\u2019s logo or formatting) or postprint (refereed,\npublisher\u2019s PDF version). Eighty-six per cent of the authors said\nthey would prefer the postprint. At the very least, authors wanted\nto see a refereed version included. No one said they would prefer\nthe non-refereed preprint version to be included. When asked:\nWhy do you prefer this version?\u2019, 38 per cent felt that the peer\nreview was like the \u2018gold standard\u2019, \u2018like the rubber stamp of\nquality\u2019, lending credibility to their work. Many considered ceding\ntheir copyright to be a fair exchange for the referencing and copy-\nediting provided by publishers. Thirty-three per cent felt that the\nrefereeing process improved the grammar and accuracy of the\ncontent of their work, and 10 percent of authors said that their work\nwould be better protected by formally assigning copyright to the\npublisher, because they would have more legal influence than they\nwould have as an individual.\nOne author specified the condition that he would want help in\ndepositing his work \u2013 \u2018I\u2019d like help getting it on there [laughs]. I\u2019ve\ngot so much stuff it seems like a mountain to climb to get it all on\nthere. What help can the library offer?\u2019 \u2013 which strongly suggests\nthat the current mediated deposit service is of value to this\nindividual.\nThe authors were asked:\nWhat would be your biggest concern about depositing your work to\nQUEprints? Seventy-six per cent of the authors said they had no\nconcerns. Concerns that were mentioned were associated with risks\nthat exist with sharing work in any format, not just in an IR, for\ninstance, the risk of plagiarism, of being misquoted, or that others\nmight use the work for unauthorized commercial gain. The issue of\nthe time involved in depositing work to QUEprints was raised as a\nconcern. Many of the authors were already involved in submitting\nwork for inclusion in their department\u2019s RAE submission, so were\nconcerned that sending work for deposit in QUEprints might cause\nduplication of effort.\nBenefits and motivations\nIn order to understand the types of benefits that the IR might have\nfrom the author\u2019s perspective, the authors were asked:\nWhat benefits do you see to putting a copy of your work in\nQUEprints? All the authors saw at least one benefit to putting a\ncopy of their work in QUEprints, and some mentioned more than\none. Of the benefits mentioned, access to a wider audience was\nmentioned by 67 per cent of the authors, and 43 per cent of the\nauthors mentioned higher citations. When asked if they would be\nmore inclined to send work for deposit in QUEprints if it meant that\ntheir work would be more widely available, 81 per cent of the\nauthors said that they would. For the majority of authors the wider\ndissemination of their work appealed to them and would be an\nincentive.\nThe authors who had sent work for deposit were then asked:\nWhat were your motivations for doing so? Authors were able to\nmention more than one motivation. Almost half (44 per cent) said\nthey had sent their work in response to a request to do so (from the\nlibrary), 44 per cent cited the potential for increased visibility of\ntheir work \u2013 \u2018the feeling that if things are not available electronically\nnowadays they may as well not be done.\u2019 \u2013 and 22 per cent\nmentioned increased citations, but overall the response was\nreactive rather than proactive, such as: \u2018The library sent an email\nasking [\u2026] I thought well there\u2019s nothing to lose by giving it to\nthem, I mean, publicity is good and if somebody gets hold of my\nstuff and cites it that\u2019s great.\u2019\nSelf-archiving versus mediated deposit\nAs mentioned above, some authors expressed concerns about the\ntime they thought might be involved in sending work for deposit in\nQUEprints and some suggested that the library could provide help.\nWhen asked directly:\nWhom would you prefer to manage the self-archiving \u2013 that\u2019s the\ndepositing \u2013 of your work to QUEprints?, 76 per cent said that they\nwould prefer the library staff to do it and 24 per cent stated as part\nof their answer that they would not want to do it themselves. Some\nauthors elaborated on their answer and their comments suggested\ncompelling reasons both for retaining the mediated service and for\nthe library to continue to provide that service, for example:\n\u2018Anyone other than me. I mean what are my options on that,\nbecause I would have thought that having it done centrally by a\nqualified librarian is a really cool idea?\u2019\n\u2018I think library staff because of the whole copyright issue and I think\nthey would have the expertise to deal with those issues.\u2019\n\u2018\u2026someone in the library that knows proper cataloguing policy. [\u2026]\nif we\u2019re going to do it, let\u2019s do it properly, with proper indexing,\nproper cataloguing, you know, professional. You don\u2019t want to let\nacademics loose on it because they\u2019ll [\u2026] use all their own little\nsystems. No, I want a proper information specialist to do it.\u2019\nThese comments also reinforce the need to explore issues such as\ncopyright and classification, both of which are being explored as\npart of the JISC-funded Embed Project12, for example, adding\nsubject terms to records as a means of enhancing retrieval.\nOne author who had not deposited work to QUEprints elaborated\n(see below) by saying that he had been deterred from doing so\nbecause of the time and hassle he thought it would involve and the\nduplicating of the process he had already gone through, putting his\nwork on his own department\u2019s website, especially the process of\nchecking copyright with publishers:\n\u2018There\u2019s quite a lot of hassle involved in sending stuff to QUEprints.\nI\u2019ve already gone through the hassle involved to put stuff in an\nopen access arena, and some of the hassle involves finding out who\nthe publishers are and contacting the publishers [\u2026] I\u2019d quite like\nthe fairies to come along and do it all for me. So that is why I\nhaven\u2019t done it. I think if everyone around me was publishing to\nQUEprints I would do so as well, but we would probably still want to\nmaintain our own Web site.\u2019\nThis illustrated a misconception of the effort currently involved in\nsending work for deposit in QUEprints, staff currently check\ncopyright on the author\u2019s behalf as part of the mediated deposit\nservice. Further research is being conducted within the Embed\nProject into ways of assisting authors with their copyright needs.\nConclusions and further research\nDespite various awareness-raising and advocacy efforts, this\nresearch suggests that many academics remain unaware of\nQUEprints, or are aware of its existence but remain detached from\nit. Throughout the research there were a number of suggestions\nfrom authors that would help them interact with the IR. To develop\na means of engaging authors more with their institutional\nrepository, in a similar way that they engage with the RAE process,\nit was concluded that further research was required. The Embed\nProject seeks to address some of these issues by developing and\ntesting a prototype fully-managed service model where the IR is\nfully integrated into the research process. Rather than on the\nrepository, the focus is on the researcher and the research process,\nproviding a range of services to support the researcher, from pre-\npublication assistance, for example proofreading, through to regular\npost-publication usage statistics. It is intended that individual\ncomponents of the model will be transferable beyond the original\ntest sites, and will help to raise the profile of IRs generally.\nReferences\n1.
