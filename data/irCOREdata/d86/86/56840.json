It encompasses a second \nrestructuring in the 1990s, the consolidation of the Scottish National \nParty as an electoral force, and the creation of the Scottish Parliament. \nThroughout the period, while there have been ebbs and flows, \nIndependents and minor parties have remained significant players in local \nelectoral politics in Scotland. \n \n \nIndependent and minor party candidates have always been a part of the electoral scene \nbut have generally, and perhaps not surprisingly, received relatively little attention \nfrom analysts (although there have been some exceptions, such as Rasmussen (1991)). \nHowever, at the local level, they have arguably been a significant component of the \npolitical landscape (see, for example, Rallings and Thrasher, 1997; Copus and Clark, \n2007). This article outlines the levels of participation and the electoral impact of \n\u2018minor party\u2019 and Independent candidates in elections for Scottish local authorities \nsince 1974.  \n \nThe elections of 1974 took place following a major restructuring of local government \nin Scotland under the Local Government Scotland Act 1973, which resulted in a two-\ntier system for all of the country, other than the three main island groups \u2013 the \nOrkneys, Shetlands and Western Isles. Here, \u2018Island Councils\u2019 were created as single-\ntier authorities to serve the small, geographically dispersed populations. On the \nmainland, the 53 lower tier district councils were responsible for local services \nincluding social housing. They varied enormously in population (electorates ranged \nfrom less than seven thousand in Nairn to nearly two-thirds of a million in the city of \nGlasgow) and geographically from concentrated urban areas to large rural areas with \nsmall and dispersed populations. The nine larger regional councils were responsible \nfor services such as education and social work. They also varied widely in geographic \nsize (Central covering around 260,000 hectares and Highland around 2,600,000 \nhectares) and population (1974 electorates ranging from nearly 1.8 million in \nStrathclyde to 75,000 in Borders). This system remained in place until 1995 when it \nwas replaced by a system of single-tier, unitary authorities. Until 2007 all local \nelections took place on the basis of single member wards and the first-past-the-post \nelectoral system, but for 2007, following an agreement between Labour and Liberal \nDemocrats to form a coalition administration after the 2003 Scottish Parliament \nelections, this was replaced by the single transferable vote, with wards electing three \nor four councillors. \n \nThe analysis which follows draws upon the collection of Scottish local election results \nsince 1974, begun by John Bochel and David Denver, and continued more recently by \nDavid Denver and Hugh Bochel. Local elections have taken place in Scotland in May \nof the following years, for each of which full data are available (some of this data is \n 3 \nalso held at the Data Archive \u2013 SN 5319 \u2013 British Local Election Database, 1889-\n2003). \n \n  Regional and Unitary \n District Councils Island Councils Councils \n 1974 1974 1995 \n 1977 1978 1999 \n 1980 1982 2003 \n 1984 1986 2007 \n 1988 1990 \n 1992 1994 \n  \nWe are able, therefore, to provide as complete coverage as is likely to be possible of \nthe participation and performance of Independents and minor (and indeed major) \nparties in Scottish local government over a thirty-three year period. Given the subject \nmatter, the time period and the lack of requirement for \u2018parties\u2019 to be registered for \nthe bulk of this period, there may be some discrepancies in the way that parties are \ndescribed and candidates\u2019 allegiance attributed by those who have collected the data. \nGiven that the overwhelming bulk of the work has been undertaken by three \nindividuals, however, these variations are likely to be less problematic than with many \ndatasets. \n \nIn 1974 the elections for both district and regional tiers were held in the same year, \nand in 1999, 2003 and 2007 council elections were held on the same days as elections \nto the Scottish Parliament, which overshadowed their local counterparts. These \ncoincident elections affected levels of turnout, and may have affected patterns of \nvoting and possibly candidature, although it is hard to identify any impact on the \npattern of candidatures by Independents or minor parties or, indeed, on votes cast for \nthem. In no year have Scottish local elections coincided with a general election in the \nUnited Kingdom, although in 1974 they came between two general elections, in \nFebruary and October, and in 1992 followed one month after the general election. \n \n \nCATEGORISING INDEPENDENTS AND \u2018MINOR PARTIES\u2019 IN SCOTTISH \nLOCAL ELECTIONS \n \nIt is clearly easier for Independents and minor parties to contest local rather than \ngeneral elections, particularly given that for the bulk of this period there was no \nrequirement to register as a party and that the barriers to local election \ncandidature are lower than for parliamentary general elections. As we have \npreviously suggested: \n \nLocal elections provide an opportunity for a range of minor parties, \nlocalised groups, and concerned, aggrieved or eccentric individuals to \nbring their points of view to the attention of the electorate. Unlike \nparliamentary elections there is no deposit to be forfeited in local elections \nshould a candidate receive only a minimal level of support. Providing that \nan individual can obtain the signatures of ten electors consenting to his \nnomination he can stand for election (Bochel and Denver, 1977: 11-12). \n \n 4 \nNot only is local government arguably more accessible for Independents and minor \nparties but their impact can also be greater, with electoral success potentially \nproviding some influence on local decision making. Such opportunities are likely to \nhave been enhanced in those places and at those times when authorities have no party \nin overall control. \n \nOf course, there may be arguments about what constitutes both \u2018Independents\u2019 and a \n\u2018minor party\u2019. Although the requirement of the Political Parties, Elections and \nReferendums Act 2000 is that only candidates standing on behalf of a registered \npolitical party are allowed to use a description on a ballot paper at an election, this has \nonly applied to the 2003 and 2007 elections of those considered here. For present \npurposes therefore, an \u2018Independent\u2019 is taken to be a person who describes themselves \nas such on the ballot paper (or, in a very small number of instances, who provides no \ndescription), while \u2018minor party\u2019 candidates include all of those who stand for local \ngovernment elections who have not described themselves as Independent or in terms \nof one of the \u2018big four\u2019 political parties in Scotland: the Conservatives, Labour, \nLiberal Democrats (including, previously, Liberals and, for a time, representatives of \nthe Social Democratic Party (SDP)) and the Scottish National Party (SNP).  \n \nThere are a variety of ways in which Independents and \u2018small\u2019 or \u2018minor\u2019 parties can \nbe conceptualised and categorised \u2013 by ideology or size, for example (see Copus and \nClark, 1997; M\u00fcller-Rommel, 1991; Smith, 1991). These frequently draw upon and \nrelate to classifications of parties at the national level and it is not our intention to \npursue this approach to any great extent, particularly as it is difficult to apply such \nclassifications systematically to Scottish local politics.  For a significant proportion of \nthe \u2018parties\u2019 considered here, many of which were clearly extremely small (sometimes \npresumably only individuals or handfuls of people) and short-lived, and which would \nbe unlikely to fit most definitions of what constitutes a political party, it is simply not \npossible to know enough about them to make a detailed classification. Rather, a brief \ncategorisation is given based upon the most obvious characteristics of those who have \nbeen candidates in Scottish local elections since 1974.  We suggest four main \ncategories with some further divided into sub-categories. \n \n1. Those who describe themselves as \u2018Independent\u2019, deliberately avoiding party \nlabels. Over the period from 1974 to 1999 there was generally a slow but \nsteady decline in the proportion of candidates and councillors from this group, \nalthough more recently the proportion of Independent candidates has again \nincreased. Copus and Bottom (2007) have argued that for England there are \nthree types of Independent, all of which are likely to occur in Scotland. These \nare, firstly, the \u2018fully independent\u2019, who has no supporting organisation and \ndoes not join in any formal group with other councillors. Secondly, the \n\u2018conjoined independent\u2019, who may join groups of Independent councillors, \nwhich may act in some ways that are similar to those of parties. Thirdly, the \n\u2018revealed independent\u2019, who stands as an Independent candidates but \nmaintains some party affiliations. In the latter group Copus and Bottom \ninclude \u2018revealed party independents\u2019, but here they are treated separately. \n \n2. Minor parties. As with Independents, recent elections have seen an increase in \nthe proportion of candidates representing minor parties. Some of these have \nexisted effectively in name only, while others have clearly displayed most or \n 5 \nall of the characteristics normally associated with political parties. It is \ntherefore worth identifying a number of sub-categories, none of which are \nmutually exclusive, but which may help inform our understanding of their \ninvolvement in Scottish local elections: \n \na. Genuine minor parties such as the Communist Party, which was of \nlong standing but never became more than a minor party, and \neffectively faded from the scene during this period. Others have \nemerged and developed both nationally and locally over the period, \nand some, such as the Scottish Socialist Party, have stood for and \ngained representation at other levels, such as the Scottish Parliament. \n \nb. Nascent or embryonic major parties, as would have been the case, for \nexample, with the SNP during the 1950s and 1960s (for example, \nMcLean, 1970; Bochel and Denver, 1972) and perhaps the Ecology \nParty\/Greens during the period considered in this article. \n \nc. Parties based in a specific locality with a specifically local focus, of \nwhich there are a small number, such as the Paisley Local Party in \n1974, through the Shetland Movement, which fought and won seats \nfrom 1986 to 1994, to the Borders Party and the East Kilbride Alliance \nin 2007. \n \nd. \u2018Splinter\u2019 parties \u2013 those which have largely been formed by \nbreakaways of members of a larger party, such as Scottish Militant \nLabour in the early 1990s, and the small rump that stood as SDP when \nthe bulk of their party merged with the Liberals to form the Liberal \nDemocrats. \n \n3. Organisations which might arguably better fit with the idea of \u2018political \nassociations\u2019 or \u2018voter associations\u2019 than political parties. There are two types, \nneither of which have been particularly common over the period. On the one \nhand, there are some relatively isolated examples of groups such as \nRatepayers\u2019 Associations or, less frequently, Residents\u2019 or Tenants\u2019 \nAssociations, and, on the other, a small number of other groups that have been \nprimarily concerned with single issues, such as the Drumchapel Anti Poll Tax \nGroup in 1988 and Local Hospital Action and Local Health Concern in 2007. \n \n4. As noted above, there are those whom Copus and Bottom (2007) term \n\u2018revealed independents\u2019, such as Independent Conservative and Independent \nLabour candidates. These are generally individuals (rather than \u2018splinter\u2019 \ngroupings) who use the \u2018independent\u2019 label but in conjunction with a party \nname (or that of a political position such as \u2018socialist\u2019). They have often fallen \nout with the party concerned, whether over a matter of principle or on other \ngrounds, and may compete against it. The numbers of candidates of this type \npeaked in Scotland in the 1970s but declined thereafter. This might be for a \nnumber of reasons. Perhaps the parties changed and sought to become more \ninclusive (or simply found it harder to get sufficient candidates so that \ndeselection of existing councillors became less common).  Possibly some of \n 6 \nthe \u2018splinter\u2019 parties or other more coherent minor parties that emerged \nbecame homes to individuals disillusioned with their previous parties. \n \nWhilst it clearly does not alter the category into which parties might fall, there is one \nother feature of some of the minor parties that have existed in Scotland over this \nperiod, and that is that a few have been closely associated with charismatic \nindividuals, such as Jim Sillars and the Scottish Labour Party in the late 1970s, and \nperhaps Tommy Sheridan and the Scottish Socialist Party from around 1999 to 2006, \nand their fortunes have closely mirrored those of these leaders. \n \nOne final point that is worth making in the context of local politics in Scotland is that \nin some areas some or all of the \u2018big\u2019 parties are \u2018minor\u2019 parties. The nature of local \npolitics in some councils means that even established parties can struggle to find both \ncandidates and electoral support. For example, even with the single transferable vote \nsystem in place in 2007, Labour contested only two of the 14 wards in the Scottish \nBorders and received only 1.9 per cent of first preference votes; the Conservatives \nreceived only 7.5 per cent of first preference votes in North Lanarkshire and 7.6 per \ncent in both Glasgow and West Dunbartonshire; and the Liberal Democrats had no \ncandidates in East Ayrshire or South Ayrshire. Only the SNP received more than 15 \nper cent of the vote in every mainland council. In the Island councils all of the main \nparties were effectively minor parties or, indeed, did not compete at all in the 2007 \ncouncil elections. This is despite the elections taking place on the same date as the \nScottish Parliament elections, which might have been expected to have had some \n\u2018nationalising\u2019 effect on the council elections. \n \nAn alternative way of considering \u2018minor parties\u2019, and perhaps particularly very \nminor or local parties, is to examine their persistence, both across local government \nboundaries and over time. Where the latter is concerned, very few of the minor parties \n(other than \u2018revealed independents\u2019) that have competed in Scottish local elections \nover the last three decades appear to have had electoral lives of more than ten years. \nThere were Communist (or equivalent, such as Democratic Left) candidates at every \nelection from 1974 to 2003 and Ecology\/Green candidates have appeared in most \nelections since 1980, although with large variations in numbers. There have been \nsporadic appearances of \u2018Liberal\u2019 candidates since the original party\u2019s merger with \nthe SDP, with a core of activists, particularly in Edinburgh, contesting elections from \n1990 to 2003, and there have been a number of \u2018Moderates\u2019, for example in \nCunninghame in the 1980s. Other than that, there have been sundry groupings such as \nResidents\u2019 Associations and Ratepayers\u2019 Associations, some of which, such as the \nRatepayers\u2019 Association in Kirkcaldy, clearly existed for a period of time. \n \nA similar pattern occurs for minor parties competing across local authority \nboundaries, whether it is across geographic boundaries in the same set of elections, or, \nprior to 1999, across district and regional elections. A small number have fought at \nboth district and regional level (notably the Communist Party and Democratic Left, \nthe Greens and the Liberal Party (again, largely in Edinburgh)), while a slightly larger \nnumber have fought European, general or Scottish Parliamentary elections, such as \nthe Communist Party, the Greens, and more recently the Natural Law Party, the \nScottish Socialist Party, and UKIP. \n \n \n 7 \nINDEPENDENTS AND MINOR PARTIES IN SCOTTISH LOCAL \nELECTIONS \n \nIt is sometimes suggested that the period prior to the 1974 reorganisation of local \ngovernment \u2013 when there were more and smaller local authorities \u2013 saw greater \ninvolvement on the part of organisations such as Ratepayers\u2019 and Residents\u2019 \nAssociations in elections. It is difficult to be sure whether or not the 1974 changes \nprecipitated a step change in the participation of minor party candidates in Scottish \nlocal elections. However, although it provides an indicative, rather than definitive, \nanswer, an analysis of some pre-1974 local election results published in The Scotsman \nand The Glasgow Herald suggests more continuity than change. In each of Scotland\u2019s \nfour major cities, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow the main \u2018minor party\u2019 \npresence in 1970 and 1971, as in 1974, was the Communist Party, although in \nAberdeen the Progressives put up a number of candidates in opposition to official \nConservatives. There were few other candidates standing under anything other than \nthe major party or Independent labels. Similarly, in other burghs, at the 1971 elections \nthe only minor party candidates to appear as anything other than individuals were 9 \nModerates (4 of whom were elected in Ayr while 2 were returned unopposed in \nDumfries and 1 in Girvan), 13 Ratepayers Association (4 elected in Linlithgow and 1 \nin Musselburgh, while a further two were unopposed in Musselburgh and Kirkcaldy), \nand 2 MIA candidates who were elected unopposed in Perth. This evidence therefore \nsuggests that the pattern of candidature by minor parties in the early 1970s was not \nsignificantly different from that in 1974. For Independents, however, the \ndisappearance of the smaller burgh councils and the greater participation of the major \nparties in many of the new authorities, probably contributed to a decline in candidates \nand their electoral fortunes. \n \nThere is no simple way to summarise the number and impact of minor parties and \nIndependents in Scottish local elections since 1974. For example, share of the vote is \nunsatisfactory because for part of this period there were significant numbers of \nuncontested wards, particularly in the more rural authorities, while the discrepancies \nin terms of electorates, varying from the low hundreds in some wards in the Islands \ncouncils before 2007 to more than 20,000 in some wards in Glasgow, are also \nunhelpful. In addition, varying patterns of competition by the major parties impact \nsignificantly on the shares of the vote for minor parties and Independents. A further \ncomplication is the fact that elections for regional councils from 1974 to 1994 were \nheld on a four-year cycle while for district elections from 1974 to 1980 there was a \nthree-year cycle and then from 1984 to 1992 a four-year cycle. From 1995 the unitary \ncouncils have been elected on a four-year cycle, but in 2007 the electoral system \nchanged from first-past-the-post to the single transferable vote. Deciding how any \nanalysis is best presented, therefore, is itself difficult. \n \nWe begin, however, with some basic figures.  Since 1974 candidates for Scottish local \nauthorities, excluding those from the four major parties, have used around one \nhundred different descriptions of themselves on ballot papers, but, while the number \nof candidates has changed significantly, the number of \u2018labels\u2019 used at each election \nhas generally not varied enormously (Table 1). \n \n \nTable 1: Number of labels used by non-major party candidates \n 8 \n \n1974 \n(Reg\/Dist) \n1977 \n(Dist) \n1978 \n(Reg) \n1980 \n(Dist) \n1982 \n(Reg) \n1984 \n(Dist) \n1986 \n(Reg) \n1988 \n(Dist) \n1990 \n(Reg) \n1992 \n(Dist) \n1994 \n(Reg) \n1995 \n \n1999 \n \n2003 \n \n2007 \n \n19 23 11 17 21 15 15 26 16 14 18 15 18 21 16 \n \n \nFigure 1 gives a rough depiction of overall trends in candidatures and seats won. It \nshows, for district council elections from 1974 to 1992 (the general trend is similar for \nregions) and for the new councils from 1995 to 2007, the percentage of candidates \nfrom minor parties and Independents and the percentage of seats won at each election \nby minor parties and Independents. Starting with candidates, the first twenty years \nshow a fairly steady decline in the percentage of Independent and minor party \ncandidates, while the period since 1999 has seen something of a revival for both. In \nterms of the number of seats won, for Independents there is also a long-term decline \nand for minor parties performance is generally poor throughout the period. The best \nperformance of the latter in terms of seats won was 2 per cent in 1977 (with 7 \nsuccessful Ratepayers Association and 4 Independent Labour candidates, as well as a \nsmattering of seats for those standing under other labels). There has clearly been \nsomething of a resurgence in the proportion of Independent and minor party \ncandidates in 2003 and 2007, but for the latter elections, although there was a real \nincrease in numbers, as discussed below, the increasing percentage of candidates who \nare Independents or from minor parties also reflects the decisions by the major parties \nto put forward fewer candidates in the multi-member STV wards than they had done \nin the previous single-member wards. It may also be the case that the more \nproportional outcomes expected under STV itself encouraged more small party and \nindependent candidates. \n \nFigure 1: Districts and councils\n0.0\n5.0\n10.0\n15.0\n20.0\n25.0\n30.0\n35.0\n19\n74\n19\n77\n19\n80\n19\n84\n19\n88\n19\n92\n19\n95\n19\n99\n20\n03\n20\n07\nYear\nC\na\nn\nd\n +\n s\ne\na\nts MP as %\nInd as %\nMP seats\nInd seats\n \n \nCandidates \n \nA relatively simple measure of electoral activity is the number of candidates put \nforward. Beginning with elections to the regional councils (Figure 2) it is clear that \nthere was a period of decline in Independents and minor party candidates from 1974 \nto 1982, followed by an increase and then another fall. In terms of the patterns of \n 9 \ncontestants, from 1974 to 1994 the regions saw a fairly slow but steady decline in the \nnumber of candidates standing as Independents, a decline in the number of \nCommunist candidates, and a surge in the number of Ecology\/Green Party candidates \nin 1986 and 1990 (particularly in Lothian and Strathclyde), followed by a fall in 1994. \n \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\nCandidates\n1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994\nYear\nFigure 2: Regions - 'minor parties' and independents\nIND\nEcol\/Green\nComm\n \n \nOver this period no other grouping made much of an impact, although there was a \nconstant smattering of \u2018independent party\u2019 or \u2018revealed independent\u2019 candidates, \nparticularly those standing as Independent Labour, but also Independent Liberals, \nIndependent Conservatives\/Progressives, and Independent Nationalists. There were \nalso some \u2018left-splinter\u2019 parties, such as Scottish Militant Labour which contested 12 \nseats in 1994. \n \nLooking at the district councils (Figure 3) there is a slightly different pattern with \nregard to Independent candidates, with the numbers ebbing and flowing, but \nremaining higher in 1992 (368) than in 1974 (345), although significantly lower than \nthe peak of  1977 (521). With regard to minor parties the pattern is roughly similar to \nthat of the regions, with the number of Communist candidates falling steadily from \n130 in 1974 to only one in 1992, and with the number of Ecology\/Green candidates \nrising from 7 in 1980 to 77 in 1992.  \n \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\nCands\n1974 1977 1980 1984 1988 1992\nYear\nFigure 3: Districts - 'minor parties' and independents\nInd\nEcol\/Green\nInd Lab\nComm\n \n 10 \n \nIn relation to minor parties it is also possible to see some patterns that, while they may \nexist at the regional level, are perhaps masked by the smaller number of candidates. \nExamples are the demise of Ratepayers Association candidates, the brief life of the \nScottish Labour Party (35 candidates in 1977 but only four in 1980), the attempt to \ncontinue in the name of the SDP (26 candidates in1988), and the persistence of \n\u2018independent party\u2019 candidates. Among the latter, although there were also \nIndependent Conservatives, Liberals, Nationalists and even an Independent Green, \nIndependent Labour candidates were the most common at almost every election and \nwere generally the most successful. \n \nMoving on to the unitary councils now in place, perhaps slightly surprisingly there \nhas been an increase in the number of people standing as Independents, from 361 in \n1995 to 434 in 1999, 485 in 2003 and 581 in 2007 (Figure 4). From Figure 4 the \nobvious developments among the minor parties are the disappearance of the Greens in \n1999 and 2003, with a re-emergence in 2007, and, despite the more or less complete \ndisappearance of Communist candidates, the increase in the number of candidates \nfrom left parties \u2013 Scottish Militant Labour in 1995, the Scottish Socialist Party from \n1999 (albeit falling back in 2007) and Solidarity in 2007. In contrast to the previous \nelections in the regions and districts, \u2018independent party\u2019 candidates more or less \ndisappeared, with no Independent Labour candidates in either 2003 or 2007. \nHowever, just as we cannot credit the introduction of  STV alone with encouraging \nmore Independent candidatures (although the argument is plausible), it cannot be said \nthat  the changed system discouraged \u2018independent party\u2019 candidates. \n \n \n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\nCands\n1995 1999 2003 2007\nYear\nFigure 4: Councils - 'minor parties' and independents\nInd\nSolid\nSSP\nGreen\n \n \n \nPerhaps the frequently discussed disillusion with mainstream politics is one factor \nbehind the increase in the numbers of minor party and Independent candidates in \nrecent years. However, given that there has been evidence of disillusion for many \nyears, this may not be an entirely adequate explanation. There is clear evidence, \nhowever, that the major parties have been suffering from falling membership and \nweakening local organisation (Clark, 2008) and this may partially explain why minor \nparties are able to attract more candidates. \n 11 \n \nThere is a clear geographical dimension to the candidatures of Independents and \nminor parties. While most elections have seen Independent candidates across Scotland \nthere have been significant geographical differences. In 1974, for example, 46 of the \n47 wards in Highland region were contested by Independents (indeed 91 of the 129 \ncandidates were Independents), 28 out of 53 in Grampian (44 out of 103 candidates), \nand 33 out of 35 in Dumfries and Galloway (64 out of 78 candidates).  On the other \nhand, only 16 of 103 wards in Strathclyde were contested by Independents (20 out of \n326 candidates), 7 out of 49 in Lothian (7 out of 134 candidates) and 7 out of 42 in \nFife (10 out of 95 candidates). Even in 2003, despite increased participation by the \nmajor parties, a similar, although weaker, pattern remained. Independents contested \n86 per cent of wards in Argyll and Bute (46 out of 109 candidates), 81 per cent in \nMoray (28 out of 78 candidates), 68 per cent in Highland (108 of 170 candidates), 59 \nper cent in Angus (18 out of 117 candidates) and 56 per cent in the Scottish Borders \n(23 of 99 candidates). In contrast, 9 authorities had fewer than ten per cent of wards \ncontested by Independents. The Islands councils have generally been dominated by \nIndependents, and this continues to be the case.  \n \nThere has also been geographic clustering of minor parties throughout the period, and \nnot simply for those with a particular local focus. The Communist Party, for example, \ntended to contest seats in authorities within the Fife and Strathclyde regions, and to a \nlesser extent within Lothian. Other \u2018left\u2019 parties, whether splinter parties such as \nScottish Militant Labour, or nascent or embryonic parties, such as the Scottish \nSocialist Party and Solidarity, have tended to focus on Glasgow, Edinburgh and to \nsome extent Dundee. The Greens too, have tended to concentrate their candidatures in \nEdinburgh and, more recently, Glasgow. \n \nShare of the vote and seats won \n \nIn terms of electoral success, as previously noted (Figure 1), minor parties have \nperformed relatively poorly, perhaps in part due to the effects of the first-past-the-post \nelectoral system. The introduction of STV in 2007 might have been expected to have \nsome impact on this, but did not, either because the 3 or 4 member ward structure \nlimited the degree of proportionality, or simply because of a lack of electoral support.  \n \nIn terms of share of the vote, Table 2 shows that Independents, and to a lesser extent \nminor parties, tended to perform better in district rather than regional elections, but \nalso that the last two sets of election, for the single-tier councils, have seen a marked \nincrease in the share of the vote going to both groupings. For minor parties this may \nbe largely attributable to an increase in the proportion of candidates, and particularly \nthe presence and performance of genuinely minor parties with significant support, \nsuch as the Scottish Socialist Party and the Greens. Similarly, 2003 and 2007 saw \nincreases in the number of Independent candidates, but there has also clearly been an \nincrease in the proportion of the electorate willing to vote for them. However, other \nevidence suggests that minor party and Independent candidates do not appear to have \nbeen significant recipients of vote transfers under the STV system. \n \nTable 2: Share of vote \n  D R D R D R D R D R C C C C \n  1977 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1995 1999 2003 2007* \n 12 \n                \nIndependents  9.8 4.9 6.7 5.1 6.8 4.8 6.1 4.5 7.3 4.7 7.6 7.2 10.1 10.9 \nMinor parties  3.3 1.9 2.2 0.6 1.6 1.1 2.4 3 1.9 1.5 1.5 1.7 3.6 4.9 \n*Share of first preference votes             \n \n \nAs with candidatures, there is also a geographic pattern to the limited electoral \nsuccess of minor parties. For example, while the Communist Party put up candidates \nin a number of authorities, its few electoral successes were largely confined to the \nformer coalfields of Fife. At the district level, Kirkcaldy, also in Fife, saw Ratepayers \nAssociation candidates being elected in the early years of this period. Later in the \nperiod, left-wing parties such as Scottish Militant Labour, the Scottish Socialist Party \nand Solidarity, won their seats in the industrial areas of the West of Scotland, and \nparticularly Glasgow. Under STV in 2005 the Greens won seats in Edinburgh and \nGlasgow. \n \nFor Independents too there is a clear geographical pattern, with the bulk of \nIndependent candidates over the period contesting seats in the less partisan rural \nareas. Nonetheless, the last two rounds of elections in 2003 and 2007 saw increases in \nthe number of Independent candidates in a number of councils outside these areas, \nincluding Angus, Fife and Edinburgh. In 2007 in particular, with the new multi-\nmember wards, there was a big increase in the percentage of wards contested by \nIndependents, so that it was not only in councils such as Highland and Moray that all \nseats were fought by Independents, but also others including Falkirk and Inverclyde. \n \nParty systems \n \nThere are clearly a number of ways in which party systems can be defined, but here \nwe will use that suggested by Bochel and Denver (1977) in relation to Scottish local \ngovernment. \u2018Partisan\u2019 authorities are those where Independents gain twenty per cent \nof seats or less; \u2018non-partisan\u2019 authorities are those where Independents gain eighty \nper cent of seats or more; and others are classed as \u2018intermediate\u2019. Given the limited \nelectoral success of minor parties, they have had little impact upon party systems \nwithin Scottish local government. In contrast, Independents have had a much more \nimmediate effect in some areas. Using this typology, in 1974 and 1977, at the district \nlevel, 26 districts were \u2018partisan\u2019, 13 districts were \u2018non-partisan\u2019, and 14 were \n\u2018intermediate\u2019. However, even in this period the \u2018non-partisan\u2019 districts were \nconcentrated on the Scottish periphery, being in Highland or Grampian regions in the \nnorth, and Borders and Dumfries and Galloway regions in the south, and contained \nless than nine per cent of the Scottish electorate. By 1980 32 districts could be classed \nas \u2018partisan\u2019, 7 as intermediate, and 14 as \u2018non-partisan\u2019, a pattern which remained \nroughly the same up to the final district elections in 1992 when 34 districts were \npartisan, 9, intermediate and 10 non-partisan. \n \nAt the regional level, even by 1978, no area, other than the three Island councils, fell \nstrictly within such a \u2018non-partisan\u2019 definition, although in Highland, Borders and \nDumfries and Galloway Independents did win more than seventy per cent of seats. \nIndependents continued to dominate these regions up to the final set of elections in \n1995 when, for the first time, the main parties won more than half of the seats in the \n 13 \nBorders and Dumfries and Galloway, leaving Highland as the one region with an \noverall Independent majority. \n \nIf we look simply at control of councils, the period from 1974 to 1994 saw \nIndependents dominate the three Islands councils, and generally Highland, Borders \nand Dumfries and Galloway. However, at the district level the number of authorities \nwith an Independent majority fell from 21 to 14. The number of councils with no \nparty in overall control has fluctuated, and this was particularly apparent within the \ndistricts, where there were 13 councils in this category in 1974 and 15 in 1997, but \nonly 4 in 1980, although the figure rose again to 13 in 1992. \n \nWhen the first elections for the new unitary authorities were held in 1995, only three \nof the 29 councils returned a majority of Independent councillors (Argyll and Bute, \nBorders and Highland) (although the three Island councils, elected the previous year, \nalso had Independent majorities), while in Dumfries and Galloway Independents were \nthe largest \u2018grouping\u2019. The number of councils with no overall control rose from 3 in \n1995 to 10 in 1999 and 11 in 2003. In 2007, under STV, only the three Island councils \nhad an Independent majority, and only two authorities, Glasgow and North \nLanarkshire gave a single party (Labour) a majority. \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nThis article has explored the involvement of Independent and minor party candidates \nin Scottish local elections over the past three decades. It has served to highlight the \nvariety of guises under which candidates, other than those from the four main parties, \nhave contested elections. It is apparent that, in general terms, Independent candidates \nhave made more of an impact over the period than have those from minor parties, \nboth in terms of the numbers of candidates and of seats won. There have been \nsignificant geographic variations in the levels of candidatures and in electoral \nperformance of Independents, with the greatest proportions and the highest success \nrates coming in the more rural, less partisan areas. In Scotland\u2019s major urban centres, \nIndependent candidates have been less common and have fared less well. In contrast, \nminor party candidates, and particularly those from the left and the environmental \nmovement, have tended to be concentrated in the urban conurbations or former \nmining areas, which is also where they have tended to achieve any limited electoral \nsuccess. \n \nSmall parties can be seen as providing new channels of engagement and participation. \nArguably, they may fill \u2018gaps\u2019 or \u2018spaces\u2019 if the major parties fail to reflect the views \nof the public or if the public become dissatisfied with major parties. Independents too \nmay be seen as fulfilling such a role, as well as enabling individuals and electors who \nmay not feel an affiliation to any party to engage with the political system. Similar \narguments can be made about the perceived disengagement of the public with politics \nwhich appears to reflect discontent with major parties, and discontent with parties per \nse (and perhaps also with politics and politicians more generally). Belanger (2004) \nhas argued that \u2018third\u2019 or \u2018minor\u2019 parties can \u2018benefit from popular dissatisfaction \nwith the functioning of party-based democracy\u2019 (p. 1073) and in that sense could \npotentially serve to provide some continued basis for the legitimacy of democratic \nsystems based upon party politics. \n 14 \n \nIn relation to such arguments, the increase in the proportions of candidates from \nIndependent and minor parties at the 2003 and 2007 elections is an interesting \nphenomenon. Although it has not resulted in any significant improvement in the \nnumber of council seats won, the increased share of the vote taken by both groups, \nsuggests that the pattern of continual change over the past thirty years will continue, \nand that there is the potential, particularly with the adoption of STV (albeit with \nwards of 3 or 4 members limiting the extent of proportionality), for greater electoral \nsuccess for such candidates in future. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15 \nREFERENCES \n \nB\u00e9langer, \u00c9., 2004, \u2018Antipartyism and Third-Party Vote Choice: A Comparison of \nCanada, Britain and Australia\u2019, Comparative Political Studies, 37\/9, 1054-1078. \n \nBochel, H. and Denver, D., various years, Scottish Council Elections (Dundee: \nElection Studies). \n \nBochel, H. and Denver, D., 2007, Scottish Council Elections 2007 (Lincoln: \nUniversity of Lincoln). \n \nBochel, J. and Denver, D., 1972, \u2018The Decline of the SNP \u2013 An Alternative View\u2019, \nPolitical Studies, 20\/3, 311-6. \n \nBochel, J. and Denver, D., various years, Scottish District Elections (Dundee: \nElection Studies). \n \nBochel, J. and Denver, D., various years, Scottish Regional Elections (Dundee: \nElection Studies). \n \nClark, A., 2008, \u2018Mass, Cadre or Franchise Parties?
