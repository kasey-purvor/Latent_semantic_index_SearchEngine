Information Security continues to mature as an organisational \nfunction and it is apparent that the management of Information Security depends on \ntechnology, processes and people.  Understandably perhaps we have become skilled \nat managing technology and process but we have been less successful at managing \npeople.  It may be that this has occurred because we have a tendency to view the \nproblem from the wrong starting point - we start from Information Security and try to \nlook outwards towards the business.  This paper aims to reverse this approach and \nlooks from the organisation towards Information Security.  It starts by examining \nwhat the human challenge is from an organisational perspective and develops the \nlinks between organisational management and the management of Information \nSecurity.  Finally it explores the challenges facing Information Security management \nand examines the extent to which these are human challenges. \nWhat do we mean by a \u2018Human Challenge\u2019? \nThe first question to address perhaps is what we mean by the phrase \u2018a human \nchallenge\u2019.  To answer this question we will explore what it means to be human in the \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 2\norganisation and how this goes beyond the role that an individual is paid to perform.  \nWe will then turn to look at the one of the main challenges that all organisations face \n\u2013 that of configuring resources.  Finally we will place our understanding of what it \nmeans to be human in the context of the challenge of configuring resources. \nBeing humans in an organisational setting \nWhen we talk about a \u2018human challenge\u2019 we have to take account of more than just \nthe roles that embody an individual\u2019s work identity (for example, sales manager, \nmanagement accountant, team leader) we also have to include the individual\u2019s unique \nattitudes, beliefs and perceptions that they bring with them to work.  With this in mind \nwe need to look at all individuals in the organisation from end users to Information \nSecurity Managers to Senior Managers and Board members.   \n \nAs a whole the humans within the organisation bring into being this rather nebulous \nphenomenon that we call organisational culture.  This is a phrase that is used liberally \nat the moment.  Organisational culture is defined by management researchers as those \npatterns of assumptions, or heuristics, that individuals will use as guidance when \nresponding to a situation in the organisation that they have not faced previously \n(Johnson & Scholes, 2002).  Three dimensions of organisational culture have been \ndefined:  observable behaviour of individuals, norms, attitudes and perceptions that \ncan be inferred from what they say and do and core values.  As we can see the latter \ntwo dimensions are largely hidden from view \u2013 these encompass the internal belief \nsystems of each individual in the organisation.  Organisational culture encompasses \nnot only the visible signals sent by controls, systems, processes and organisation \nstructures but also, and perhaps more importantly, the elements that lie under the skin \nof the organisation such as the rituals and routines that are followed and the stories \nthat are told round the water cooler, during a coffee or in the canteen.  Being human \nin an organisation is a mixture of the role that an individual is paid to fulfil together \nwith their personal and social identity and it is that helps to form the culture of the \norganisation. \nThe Organisational Challenge \nOrganisations face many different challenges but if we take a strategic view then \nprobably the primary challenge they face is to ensure that the way in which resources \nare configured achieves maximum value for shareholders or stakeholders (Johnson & \nScholes, 2002).  The term \u2018resources\u2019 is used in its widest sense to include the \nstructure of the organisation, how it defines and implements the processes it follows \nhow it defines its boundaries both geographically, logically and in terms of the \nbusiness it carries out and how it manages relationships both internally and externally. \n \nThe challenge of configuring resources becomes more complex when we think about \nsome of the current trends in the business environment such as the speed of change \nbecause of new technology (this makes strategy difficult to develop), the importance \nof knowledge creation and knowledge sharing and the need to compete in a global \nmarket.  \n \nSo how are organisations trying to meet this challenge of configuring resources?  \nWhat follows is a widely observable example.  Organisations now recognise that one \nof their critical success factors is how they integrate knowledge.  Unfortunately much \nof the knowledge in an organisation is tacit and can only be successfully used by \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 3\nthose who posses it.  The best option for configuring the structure of the organisation \nthen is to put in place what is referred to as a \u2018loose-tight\u2019 structure.  This is a difficult \nbalance to achieve but involves keeping a tight command and control approach in \nsome areas of the business while allowing for a more participatory approach in others.  \nThis can be a fairly uncomfortable situation for people who like clearly defined roles \nand boundaries.  It means that in some instances one individual, part of the \norganisation or one partner will lead and in other instances the lead role will fall \nsomewhere else.  The success of this will depend on negotiation and salesmanship.  \nSomeone has to have the final say, however, because unsurprisingly this structure can \nlead to conflict and increase the time to make decisions which an organisation does \nnot usually have.  To ensure that a power lever is in place there needs to be an \nimbalance and this is often achieved through limiting access to financial resources. \n \nWhat this approach to leads to, is a move away from highly vertical, hierarchical \nstructures to a flatter, more networked structure.   In an organisational sense networks \nusually have fuzzy boundaries and depend on collaboration \u2013 the basis for this is trust \nand reciprocity between individuals, teams and departments and partner organisations.   \n \nThe human challenge then is to manage the mix of the organisational, social and \npersonal elements of individual identity.  This has to be done in such a way to ensure \nmaximum benefit for the organisation through the combination of resources such as \norganisational structure, business processes, boundaries and relationships.  This has to \nbe achieved within a fluid and flexible business environment that increasingly favours \na flatter, more networked organisational structure.  \n \nWhat do we mean by \u2018Information Security \nManagement\u2019? \nThe Information Security arena has expanded over recent years \u2013 growing from a \ntechnical initiative and labelled IT Security towards a broader, more business focused \nconcern, for the protection of information in all its forms across the organisation.  It is \nno longer simply the aim to protect confidentiality, integrity and availability of \ninformation but Information Security aims to deliver real business benefits now by \nboth protecting and yet facilitating the controlled sharing of information and \nmanaging the associated risks across a changing threat environment.  This change in \nemphasis means that many more functions within the enterprise have a role to play \u2013 \nsome at a general level and some with a specific niche role (particularly at the \ntechnical end).  Information Security as a concept has developed both breadth and \ndepth and, as it rightly becomes an embedded function in the organisation, it needs the \noverlay of a strong management system to determine how these aims can be achieved \nefficiently and coherently. \nManagement of the organisation  \nIn this section we will consider what we mean by management in the organisational \ncontext, what the management aspects of Information Security are and finally what \nbenefits Information Security management offers Information Security as a whole. \n \nThe traditional definition of management is the way something (in this case the \nbusiness of an organisation) is conducted, controlled and supervised.  It is described \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 4\nvariously as an activity, work or an art, the latter description perhaps is particularly \napt in light of the human challenge outlined above.  Management of an organisation is \nabout the control of business activity in order to provide for continuous improvement \nin the performance of that activity in order to achieve organisational objectives.   \n \nAs we have already seen one of the key challenges for management will be the \nconfiguration of resources.  In order to address this in a rigorous and repeatable \nmanner an organisation will have in place a management system.  This will \nencompass policies, processes and practices that embody control and change \nmanagement principles.  The aim will be to ensure that these principles are applied on \na consistent basis. \n \nWhile each organisation will have its own overarching management system it may \nrely on standard management systems for specific types of business activity.  For \nexample, ISO 9001 is a standard for quality management systems, ISO 14001 is for \nenvironmental management systems and the one that is perhaps most pertinent to us is \nISO 27001 for Information Security management systems.   \n \nManagement then is the activity of ensuring the optimum configuration of resources \nin an organisation.  This will usually be implemented in such a way that ensures the \nactivity is rigorous and repeatable, and often auditable as well.  Where the ability to \naudit a management system is key then an internationally recognised standard may be \nused.   \nThe purpose of Information Security Management \nWe now have an understanding of what management is in general but what are the \nmanagement elements of Information Security in particular?  This section considers a \nrange of different opinions on what Information Security management covers and \nfinds that they are all broadly in agreement.  We start with looking at ISO 27001 and \nthen move on to consider other views. \n \nISO 27001 defines the management aspects of Information Security as, \u2018that part of \nthe overall management system, based on a business risk approach, to establish, \nimplement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve information security\u2019.  It \nstates that this includes, \u2018organizational structure, policies, planning activities, \nresponsibilities, practices, procedures, processes and resources\u2019.  This seems to align \nwell with our previous definition of what management means and its primary aim of \nconfiguring resources. \n \nISO 27001 is often implemented in an organisation to ensure that there is a consistent, \nrepeatable and auditable means of addressing information security issues.  The \nrequirement for a standardised approach provides a firm basis for decision-making, \nbudget allocation, etc.  It also offers confidence to internal and external stakeholders \nthat security is being effectively addressed.   \n \nWhile we have defined what Information Security management is it might be useful \nto think about what it can offer Information Security as a function within the \norganisation.  We could think about what happens when Information Security is \npractised without any management and contrast this with what improvements are \nlikely to occur with a management system in place. \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 5\n \nAn unmanaged approach to Information Security is likely to lead to a piecemeal \napproach to implementing security controls (for example, with an ensuing haphazard \ncollection of firewalls, staff vetting policies, CCTV cameras etc).  The result is likely \nto be that not all risks are adequately addressed and some controls may be \ninappropriate or over elaborate.  We have to say that this is \u2018likely\u2019 because there will, \nat the very least, be a lack of clarity about whether Information Security objectives \nhave been achieved.  This is because without management it will be difficult to \nunderstand what has been done, why, by whom and for what purpose. \n \nOn the other hand the management of Information Security will ensure the, \u2018selection \nof adequate and proportionate security controls that protect information assets and \ngive confidence to third parties\u2019 (ISO 27001).  It is clear from this extract that \nInformation Security management has both an internal and external contribution to \nmake. \n \nBy managing Information Security we start to address the challenge of configuring \nthe resources that we have available.  For example a robust, repeatable and auditable \napproach means: \n \n\u2022 It is possible to justify budget and resource requirements and provides a \nlogically sound business case for action \n\u2022 Wider organisational contributions are made to do with business \nefficiency, achieving regulatory compliance, protection of brand, \nreputation and proprietary information, etc \n\u2022 Involving decision-makers in the formulation of the business-related \naspects of Information Security \n\u2022 A systematic approach to the analysis and treatment of information risks, \nto the implementation of security controls and to the measurements, \nmonitoring and review of those controls. \n\u2022 We have practices and a control position that allows for an intelligent \ndiscussion with \nshareholders and regulators \n\u2022 Finally it makes a contribution to the continuing development of the \nInformation Security as a profession and this is an aspect that we will \nreturn to later. \n \nWe can see that by managing Information Security we are more likely to be able to \nconfigure the resources available in an optimum manner.  We are also able to forge \nstronger links between Information Security and other functions in an organisation \nand to have a defensible position for when we are dealing with external organisations, \nshareholders and stakeholders.  \n \nAt an operational level the techniques that comprise information security management \nhave been listed as knowledge and experience, information relating to incidents and \nvulnerabilities, risk analysis and risk management, strategy and planning, policy and \nstandards, processes and procedures, methodologies and frameworks, awareness and \ntraining, audits, contracts and outsourcing (Purser, 2004).  It is interesting that \nknowledge and experience appear at first on the list.  These are intrinsically human \nqualities.  When we also consider that academics and practitioners agree that \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 6\nsuccessful management of Information Security depends on authority, leadership, \nvision and good management practice we can see the importance of so-called \u2018soft\u2019 \nskills in successfully managing Information Security.  It is these skills that are largely \ninnate in individuals rather than being learned in order to carry out an organisational \nrole. \n   \nInformation Security management comprises the activities associated with \nconfiguring resources in order to meet Information Security objectives in a way that \nbest serves the organisation.  Critical activities include the implementation of policies, \nprocesses and procedures as well as the ability to exercise soft skills.  Information \nSecurity management also helps to align Information Security with other functions of \nthe organisation.  It provides a way of establishing to third parties how Information \nSecurity is implemented and maintained.  Finally it moves us closer to establishing \nInformation Security as a profession. \n \nWhile Information Security management activities undoubtedly include processes and \nprocedures it seems that there are a number of critical success factors that depend on \nsoft skills.  Such skills often emerge from the personal and social identities (rather \nthan the organisational identity) of individuals that we acknowledged at the beginning \nof this article.   It is these skills that ensure beneficial relationships are developed and \nmaintained and ensures the ability to address the human challenge. \nSo what are the challenges facing Information \nSecurity Management? \nWe have already examined the primary management challenge in an organisation \u2013 \nthat of configuring resources in a rapidly changing business environment.  We have \nalso explored the nature of the Information Security management.  In this section we \nwill look at the challenges of managing Information Security by setting it against the \nchallenge of configuring structures, processes, boundaries and relationships.  As the \nfirst three of these have been quite widely examined by practitioners we shall just \ntouch on them here.  Relationships, or the human challenge, however have largely \nbeen neglected and as this is where we shall focus our attention.  \nStructural, process and boundary challenges \nInformation Security management has to face the challenge of working within the \nmore fluid business environment of the 21st century.  As we have already discussed \nhard boundaries (geographical, physical and logical) are breaking down and \nInformation Security has to be managed across a network of partnerships, alliances \nand outsourcing relationships.   Flatter organisational structures have led to the \ndevolution of risk and trust decisions to a lower, often individual, level.  This is \ncoupled with the requirement to integrate individuals and groups in order to better \nexploit tacit knowledge.   \n \nFor practitioners this challenge translates at an operational level to managing \nInformation Security against time and resource constraints in a swiftly changing \nbusiness environment.  There is often acknowledged to be a lack of Information \nSecurity expertise at all levels and yet there is an increased rate of change in the \nbusiness environment evidenced by re-structuring, mergers, acquisitions and \nalliances.  These changes each have an impact on the management of Information \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 7\nSecurity.  For example, there is the demand for increased connectivity and the need \nfor flexibility in the use of new technology.  Increasingly organisations need to share \ninformation with customers, stakeholders and cross the value chain.  This has to be \nmanaged in a way that ensures that the risk to information remains at an acceptable \nlevel. \n \nThe human challenge \nIt has been said that hackers spend more time considering human challenges than \nInformation Security practitioners (Adams & Sasse, 1999).  In the section that follows \nwe will consider why humans are difficult to manage in the context of Information \nSecurity, what some of the major challenges are in building successful relationships \nfor Information Security management and finally, what skills Information Security \nManagers need to develop in order to be successful. \nChanging Organisational Culture \nResearchers have suggested for some time that the management of Information \nSecurity is about, \u2018more than just locks and keys and must relate to the social \ngrouping and behaviour\u2019 (Dhillon & Backhouse, 2001).  A small number of \nresearchers have repeatedly suggested that there is a need to achieve a better \nunderstanding of the social aspects of the organisation; in particular the human \nelement.   \n \nUnfortunately humans are not very predictable.  They do not operate as machines \nwhere if the same information is input and processed in the same way then the result \nthat is output will be the same time after time.  They can appear erratic in behaviour \nbecause we often fail to take account of the individual belief systems that humans \nbring into the organisation.  As we discussed at the beginning of the paper it is this \nmix of organisational role together with personal and social identity that helps to form \nthe organisational culture.   \n \nOpinion is divided but while we may be able to change observable behaviour it is \nquestionable whether we can get beneath the skin of an individual to change attitudes, \nperceptions and core values with technology and processes.  While there may be those \nwho believe that we can achieve cultural change through technology and process it \nwould seem that incidents such as those experienced by Nationwide Building Society, \nHMRC, DVLA and the MoD (just to name those that perhaps have had the highest \nprofiles) do point to the failure of process and technology to protect information.  In \neach of these cases it seems the end user did not posses the correct heuristics for \nhandling information that would have steered them in the right direction of protecting \nthe information.  As each of the recent data handling reports has suggested that \norganisational culture has a large part to play. \nDeveloping the identity of the Information Security Manager \nWe can\u2019t lay all the blame at the feet of the end user, however, as we have seen that \nthe development of organisational culture is a collective activity.  One of the \ndifficulties for Information Security Managers is that often their role has been that of \nthe technical specialist with a command and control approach to management.  They \nhave tended to take decisions concerning information security with little involvement \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 8\nor negotiation with employees.  As we have seen, good Information Security \nmanagement increasingly depends on people as well as processes and technical \nconsiderations.  Increasingly Information Security Managers are attempting to replace \nthe command and control approach with a more collegiate style.  This involves being \nseen to help end users and to discuss and negotiate decision about broader \nInformation Security management issues.  Unfortunately research has shown that \nthese two roles sometimes get confused and this can lead to contradictions in the \nmessages that are sent out to end users (Ashenden, 2007).  \n \nInformation Security Managers themselves are aware of some of the difficulties \ninherent in the identity they present to the organisation.  On the one hand if they take \na command and control stance then they position themselves almost in a paternal role \n\u2013 they are there to look after the end users who cannot look after themselves.  From \nthe end user\u2019s perspective if this is the case then why do they need to be aware of \nInformation Security requirements?  The paternal Information Security Manager will \nlook after them.   \n \nIf, on the other hand, the Information Security Manager takes a more collegiate \napproach and empowers end users to take more decisions with regard to Information \nSecurity then there is the likelihood that more incidents will occur (at least in the short \nterm) and mistakes will be made.  This stance requires an acceptance of this and \nperhaps a greater investment in resilience and recovery. \n \nInterviews with Information Security Managers, however, make it apparent that they \nfocus on talking, presenting and reinforcing ideas but do not mention listening to end \nusers.  In general Information Security Managers do not often engage with end users \nto try and understand how they perceive Information Security.  Instead they rely on \nhow they think end users see Information Security (a view which is unlikely to be \nneutral).   \nCommunicating Effectively \nTo a large extent ensuring the optimum configuration of resource for managing \nInformation Security depends on change management and how the need for change is \ncommunicated and received by end users across an organisation.  As Adams and \nSasse point out insufficient communication with end users, \u2018causes them to construct \ntheir own model of possible security threats and the importance of security and these \nare often wildly inaccurate\u2019 (p.43).  To manage the human challenge Information \nSecurity Managers have to get beneath the skin of end users if they are to change \norganisational culture. \n \nIn-depth interviews with Information Security Managers have shown that this is an \narea where they feel uncomfortable.  They recognise the importance of being able to \ncommunicate effectively with end users but acknowledge that they often lack the \nnecessary skills in this area and are often operating outside their comfort zone. \n \nThen too there is the well documented communication gap between Information \nSecurity Managers and Senior Managers or Board Members in an organisation.  \nInformation Security Managers have always had a problem persuading senior decision \nmakers of the importance of their subject.  There is still a perception that Information \nSecurity is a technical subject and is therefore best delegated and managed by \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 9\ntechnical staff.  This only serves to disassociate it from the business and it is easy to \nsee why this is increasingly a problem in today\u2019s business environment. \n \nThe situation has been changing though with Information Security becoming a topic \nthat needs to be addressed at the Board level because of the regulatory environment.  \nCorporate governance requirements (such as Turnbull, Basle II and Sarbanes Oxley) \nhave meant that Board members now have to take responsibility for ensuring that  \nthey have sound processes in place for managing risk.  Mature organisations are now \nrecognising the importance of Information Security Governance \u2013 that is how \nInformation Security processes are directed and controlled both within the \norganisation and between the organisation and its business partners.  One aspect of \nInformation Security Governance is ensuring that resources are configured in an \noptimum manner. \n \nUnfortunately there are still a considerable number of organisations where \nInformation Security remains a purely technical aspect of business operations and \neven in those organisations with a more mature approach there is still often a gap \nbetween those responsible for Information Security and the Board.  Unsurprisingly \nperhaps studies have been carried out that demonstrate that senior decision makers in \norganisations have varying perceptions of the risks to their information and that, \nfrequently, these are determined by business objectives (McFadzean et al, 2007).  It is \nthese perceptions that need to be understood in order for them to be managed and for \nbetter communication to take place to encourage informed debate and decision \nmaking at the senior management level. \n \nSo why does the gap exist?  The first reason perhaps is communication itself.  It has \nbeen pointed out that the language of Information Security tends to be technical and \nspecialised and, as a result, Board members fail to engage.  This failure to gain senior \nlevel buy-in means that security awareness across organisations tends to be poor in \nspite of the best efforts of Information Security Managers. \n \nFurthermore Information Security Managers have traditionally not been successful \nadvocates or champions for their function.  Information Security is still seen as being \na restriction on the business and, despite good intentions, is not seen as a business \nenabler or a source of competitive advantage.  If Information Security management is \ndiscussed at the level of Senior Managers then it is often in response to an incident. \nDeveloping the skills to manage the human challenge \nIf we turn to consider the skills needed to be a successful Information Security \nManager these then should include the ability to meet the challenges that have been \ndescribed in this paper.  Indeed the requirements for an Information Security Manager \nhave nearly changed out of recognition in recent years.  For example, one post, for an \ninformation security consultant requires: a high degree of technical knowledge, \nUNIX, Linux, firewall management, encryption, transmission protocols, PKI, \nexperience of penetration testing \u2013 so far so good, they want a strong technical \nbackground but then the advert goes on to state that along with this they want BS \n7799 and governance processes, expert working knowledge of information security \npolicies and standards, ability to analyse existing and planned processes, knowledge \nof all relevant laws (Data Protection, Computer Misuse, Copyrights and Patents) and \nthe ability to undertake risk assessments.  Presumably in the light of recent incidents \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 10\nand reports we can now add to this the ability to change organisational culture and \nimplement security awareness programmes.   \n \nWe are likely to see more of this and it is something that Des Lee from CIO-Connect \nhas explored (2005).  He was referring to types of CIOs but the examples he describes \ntranslate well to the CISO space and Information Security management as a whole.  \nHe starts off by suggesting that traditionally there were two groups of CIOs; plumbers \nand architects.  Plumbers connect up pipes down which data flowed and in his words \nfor them it was about \u2018technology, technology, technology\u2019.  Plumbers are important \n(as we all know they are both a scarce resource and expensive) and in security terms a \ngood plumber should fulfil the technical requirements of the job advert previously \ndescribed.  The other group are architects who work from the business plan and figure \nout how best to deliver \u2013 a role that Lee refers to as \u2018one of sweeping up after the \nparade\u2019 \u2013 they are still not seen as essential contributors to the development of the \nplan.  To follow the example through an architect should perhaps be able to cover the \nbroader business focussed requirements of the job description.  Of course architects \nwho can also do the plumbing (and vice versa) are few and far between and very \nvaluable. \n \nMost interesting perhaps is that Lee then goes on to talk about a third role \u2013 that of the \n\u2018change warrior\u2019 and suggests that this emergent role needs a totally different skill set \n\u2013 that of a good change manager.  It has been suggested that the success of \nInformation Security Managers depends on \u2018power plays\u2019 (Ezingeard et al, 2004).  \nThis is something that is usually completely neglected in Information Security \nManagement and yet most of what we do is about change of one type or another, \neither process, structural or cultural.  Lee points out that these change warriors need \nexcellent communication skills and political nous in order to be good change \nmanagers.  The role has to be proactive and encompass the breadth of business skills \nthat senior managers should possess \u2013 this is why we are seeing individuals being \nbrought in from the business (many now have a grounding in IT) to run Information \nSecurity management rather than pushing up the plumbers and architects who are \nalready in place.   \n \nIdeally an Information Security management structure will bring together plumbers, \narchitects and change warriors but if plumbers and architects are not willing to \ndevelop or practice the skills required to become change warriors then they may well \nsee themselves superseded at the senior management level.  A technical grounding is \nalways going to be important but perhaps it is technical breadth rather than depth that \na change warrior should be looking for.  The key pieces of the jigsaw are \ncommunication skills, political nous and ability to sell security, negotiate for \nresources and buy-in and manage relationships.  It is the soft skills that will help the \nchange warrior get closer to changing organisational culture. \n \nThis section has focused on the challenges facing Information Security management \nand has aligned these with the challenges that have been identified in the wider \norganisational context.  It is suggested that structural, process and boundary \nchallenges have been recognised and are widely discussed while relationship or \nhuman challenges are only just coming to the fore.  The human challenges facing the \nmanagement of Information Security come from trying to change organisational \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 11\nculture, the identity of the Information Security Manager, communicating effectively \nand developing the skills to meet these challenges. \nConclusion \n \nThis paper has examined the human challenges that face Information Security \nmanagement.  The human challenge has been defined broadly as being about \nmanaging individuals in an organisation both within their specific roles but whilst also \nacknowledging that they have personal and social identities that impact on their \nbehaviour.  The challenge is to manage the unpredictability that this offers in a way \nthat ensures the optimum structure, business processes, boundaries and relationships \nare in place to help the organisation achieve its objectives. \n \nInformation Security management is the way that these resources are configured in \norder to meet Information Security objectives that, in turn, contribute to the success of \nthe organisation.  Good management of Information Security legitimises the function \nin the wider organisational context and provides evidence of a mature approach to \nthird parties.  Finally it helps to establish Information Security as a profession. \n \nThe challenges facing Information security management unsurprisingly stem from \nthose facing the management of the organisation as a whole.  They centre on the \nconfiguration of resources that we discussed at the beginning of this article that help \nto optimise structure, process, boundaries and relationships.  Our focus has been on \nthe challenge of managing relationships as this aligns with our concept of the human \nchallenge and it is this challenge that has been overlooked.  As we have seen the \nhuman challenge is in trying to change organisational culture.  This depends on \ndeveloping a better identity for the Information Security Manager which in turn can \nbe achieved through more effective communication.  This will create a virtuous circle \nwhere good communication with end users and Senior Managers will improve the \nidentity of the Information Security Manger.  To achieve this, however, it is likely \nthat Information Security Managers need to develop their skills in different areas so \nthat they can become change warriors. \nReferences \nAshenden, Debi, and Sasse, M.
