Based on our\nexperience of working on teaching technology programmes, within the framework of national and\ninstitutional initiatives, it is evident that the establishment of an institutional strategy, and its\nimplementation in a supporting university-wide programme of staff development and training,\ntogether with strong commitment at the senior managerial level, are imperatives which determine\nthe successful integration of learning technology within academic institutions.\nIntroduction\nThe imminent completion of many Teaching and Learning Technology Programme\n(TLTP) projects means that a considerable number of courseware deliverables will soon\nbe available to Higher-Education (HE) institutions. The Higher Education Funding\nCouncil's intention in funding the Programme (HEFCE Circulars, 8\/92, 13\/93) was to\nensure their integration into academic curricula by providing institutions with an\nopportunity to review their 'teaching and learning culture' with regard to the embedding\nof learning technology within their institutional practice. Two recent workshops,\nconducted with a representative sample of newly appointed academic staff in connection\nwith the evaluation of materials to be included in a staff development pack whose\npurpose is to encourage the use of IT in teaching and learning (TLTP Project 7), strongly\nsuggested that the availability of courseware alone was insufficient to ensure its\nintegration into educational practice. The establishment of enabling mechanisms at the\ninstitutional level, as well as within departments, was crucial to ensure the effective use of\nlearning technology.\n92\nALT-] Volume 3 Number I\nInstitutional commitment\nThe priorities of the national teaching technology initiatives which have been funded\nduring the last decade (CTI, ITTI, TLTP) have reflected the increasing capacity and\nfunctionality of hardware and software as well as the growing emphasis on curriculum\ndevelopment. There has been a development from computer-led initiatives to\npedagogically driven priorities. It is within the institutional context that these nationally\nidentified objectives, institutional policy and implementation meet, where policy is\ndeveloped and programmes delivered. The institution is the dynamic interpretative\nelement working between the national and local levels, yet to date the institutional\nperspective has been the least regarded.\nIn a recent ITTI project, which investigated the core IT skills which were required by\nuniversity staffs in order to execute their job functions, the institutional context, particularly\nthe strength of institutional support, was found to be the most significant factor influencing\nimplementation and practice. The report (Hodgson et al, 1994) was the result of a\nnationwide consultation exercise in which about a quarter of UK universities participated.\nInitial advisory discussions were conducted with representatives of the variety of interests\nwhich contribute to the formulation of IT and teaching and learning policy - IT managers,\nstaff development advisers, teaching and learning co-ordinators, and senior managers.\nSixteen universities, drawn equally from the former UFC and PCFC sectors, went on to\nform internal working parties to identify which core IT skills were required within their\ninstitutional context amongst academic, administrative and clerical staffs, thus enabling\nthem effectively and efficiently to operate their job functions consistently with institutional\npriorities. Each institution collected relevant background information about itself, then\ndefined and conducted the business of its working party in order for the results to be most\ninformative for its own forward planning as well as reporting back to the project.\nThe institutional reports indicated that there was an already pervasive use of information\ntechnology across institutions and that its application in all areas of a university's business\nwas rapidly increasing. Generally, staff had a positive attitude to the use of information\ntechnology, and expected to be offered the opportunity to develop their skills further.\nCurrent training provision was, however, often patchy and uncoordinated and was likely\nto be supply- rather than needs-driven. It was not always related to institutional needs.\nEffective information technology training provision was most likely to arise from firm\ncommitment at the institutional level. The foundation of this commitment was the\ndevelopment of an institutional information strategy with associated faculty or\ndepartmental strategies. These strategies would incorporate responsibilities for the\ninstallation of up-to-date technology, made widely available across distributed networked\nsystems, together with the provision of appropriate training opportunities. There needed\nto be a clear relationship between institutional strategy, staff development and training\nprogrammes. It was essential for this relationship to be reflected in effective resource\nallocation mechanisms, especially in a devolved budgetary organization.\nFor the delivery of training programmes, a structured approach was preferred. This might\n\u2014\nAudrey McCartan et al. Enabling learning through technology\nbe based on the identification of core skills, related to particular job functions. A 'bricks'\napproach, where the skills were defined in terms of levels, would enable training provision\nto link the acquisition of particular skills and levels to specified institutional functions.\nThe strong staff development interest would ensure coherent and co-ordinated provision\nfor individual members of staff while supporting the effective implementation of\ninstitutional planning.\nIn order to ensure responsiveness to user needs, the programme would encompass a\nvariety of learning opportunities. Although traditionally these have mainly been provided\nthrough taught courses with supporting documentation, new learning methods and mixed\nmedia were now available to enable increased flexibility and customization in delivery.\nThe recognition of informal methods of learning, such as training selected staff to\nundertake limited training responsibilities within their section, would maximize the use of\nrelevant expertise and experience.\nAn identified group of staff for whom particular provision was urgently required was\nsenior managers. They were responsible for the formulation of policy and its implementa-\ntion. They needed to be aware of, if not actually competent in the use of, the wide ranging\npower of modern computer networks and its impact on institutional practices, as well as\nthe implications of the pervasiveness of technology for future planning, including job\nfunctions (TLTP Project 45).\nTeaching Technology Initiatives\nThe institutional imperative emphatically to support staff development within the\nimplementation of a university-wide policy to encourage, support and develop the use of\ninformation technology in teaching and learning has been implemented at the University\nof Durham through two Teaching Technology Initiatives posts. These staff work in\npartnership with academics to review their course structure, content, delivery, assessment\nand evaluation methods in respect of the appropriate and effective use of IT. They co-\nordinate the dissemination of knowledge and increase awareness about developments in\ncomputer-aided learning. The awareness program includes university-wide and depart-\nmental presentations and hands-on sessions, staff development sessions, contributions to\ntext-based newsletters, and running mail groups. Development work in departments\nincludes advice, information and the development of substantial courseware projects. To\ndate, courseware has been developed successfully for projects in archaeology, chemistry,\neducation, geography and Spanish.\nSelecting software for successful courseware\nThe success of courseware in achieving educational objectives is in part dependent on\nselecting the most appropriate development tool. The learning objectives must be\nanalysed* then clearly defined in order to evaluate which software would be most suitable\nto achieve these educational goals.\nConsequently, at the University of Durham, courseware has been developed in:\n94\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\n\u2022 the core spreadsheet application - Quattro Pro for Windows\n\u2022 the assessment package - Question Mark Professional\n\u2022 the authoring package - ToolBook\nLearning Errors in Measurement in Chemistry was developed using the University-\nrecommended spreadsheet, Quattro Pro for Windows, to utilize its spreadsheet functions.\nThe first-year chemistry students start by acquiring a foundation knowledge of Quattro\nPro, using the self-study guides of the Computer Literacy Programme. The students need\nto understand how to navigate through Quattro Pro in order to be able to use the full\npotential of the courseware. They then use the CAL material in supervised practical\nsessions as an integrated part of their course.\nStudents read the explanatory text, and are then directed to pages of exercises. They learn\ninteractively by calculating their own values for the exercises and entering them into the\nspreadsheet. The built-in spreadsheet functions are used, through macros, to make the\ngraphs change according to their values and to check their answers. The students click the\nAm I Right? button to find out if their answers are correct or need modifying. The\ncourseware is based on random numbers, so the students all have different values for their\nexercises, and are able to start again with new values if they wish. There is a summary\npage which holds all the values entered by students and the students are requested to give\na hard copy of this page to the lecturer.\nQuestion Mark Professional is an easy-to-use computerized assessment and examination\nprogram. Its strength lies in its analysis and reporting facilities. As part of the preparation\nfor a departmental test, a General Knowledge Test has been written to enable the\nFigure f: Errors \u00a1n\nMeasurement\ndeveloped in Quattro\nPro.\nTh\u00ab general equation for this cum it shown next to the histogram.

At the end of\na departmental test, the students were asked if they found the software easy to use, and\n97% found it 'Easy' or 'Very easy'. This positive result is partly due to the students being\nable to become familiar with the package through the General Knowledge Test.\nUntil recently, Spanish syntax had been taught using only lecture notes. Students had\nfound this topic difficult to grasp, and the aim of the Spanish Syntax project is to use the\nhypermedia facilities of ToolBook to enhance the learning of the subject material through\ninteractive examples and tests. Colour is used consistently throughout the courseware to\nidentify the different syntactical units of sentence structure.\nThere are different types of exercises, including tree diagrams, following each explanation\nof the syntax. In many of the exercises, the students click the Am I Right? button to find\nout if they have completed the exercise correctly. If they have not answered correctly, they\nare given hints, e.g. on vocabulary or abbreviations. After two attempts, the answer is\ngiven to them. This is to allow the students to be able to learn through their mistakes and\nprogress to the next question. The students use this CAL material as an integrated part of\ntheir course.\nConclusion\nFirm institutional commitment is imperative to enable learning through technology. A\nclear relationship between an information technology strategy, staff development and\ntraining provision, supported by appropriate resource allocation mechanisms, is essential\nto ensure coherent and co-ordinated provision for all staff.\n96\nALT-] Volume 3 Number I\nSENTENCE STRUCTURE- Exercises\nART N PR ADJ N\nLas p\u00e1ginas de este hbro\ncop Y Y-jartSUB COMF\nest\u00e1n manchadas\nVou mus\u00ed use the TAB kevhetu'ee\u00ab aMimiatioHboxes\nFigure 3: Spanish Syntax - ToolBook\nSelecting the most appropriate software for the development of courseware has resulted\nin successful and enjoyable learning.
