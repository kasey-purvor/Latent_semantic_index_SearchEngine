Six \ndifferent sources of uncertainty are discussed: future greenhouse gas emissions; Global \nClimate Model (GCM) structure; downscaling from GCMs (including Regional Climate \nModel structure); hydrological model structure; hydrological model parameters and the \ninternal variability of the climate system (sampled by applying different GCM initial \nconditions). These sources of uncertainty are demonstrated (separately) for two example \ncatchments in England, by propagation through to flood frequency impact. The results \nsuggest that uncertainty from GCM structure is by far the largest source of uncertainty. \nHowever, this is due to the extremely large increases in winter rainfall predicted by one \nof the five GCMs used. Other sources of uncertainty become more significant if the \nresults from this GCM are omitted, although uncertainty from sources relating to \nmodelling of the future climate is generally still larger than that relating to emissions or \nhydrological modelling. It is also shown that understanding current and future natural \nvariability is critical in assessing the importance of climate change impacts on \nhydrology.  \n \nKeywords \nClimate change; uncertainty; hydrological impacts; flood frequency. \n \n1. Introduction \nThere is uncertainty in the results of any modelling, of different types and from different \nsources. Any individual source of uncertainty, if quantified in some way, can be \npropagated through to give an uncertainty in the end result. This propagation could be \ndone individually, for each different source of uncertainty, (termed here \u2018single-\npropagation\u2019) or in combination with other sources (termed here \u2018multi-propagation\u2019). It \nis possible that some uncertainties can be reduced, through research or modelling \nimprovements, and the quantification and propagation of uncertainty sources could \nallow research to be targeted at specific areas where uncertainty is currently large but \npotentially reducible. However, some uncertainties cannot currently be reduced and it is \nunlikely that uncertainty can ever be completely removed. In the case where modelling \nresults are presented with some quantification of (currently irreducible) uncertainty, the \nend-user of the results must decide how best to take account of that uncertainty within \n 2 \nthe decision-making process. Proper quantification of uncertainty is vital to facilitate a \nrisk-based approach to decision-making. \n \nThis paper considers various sources of uncertainty which apply in hydrological \nmodelling for flood frequency estimation under climate change, using data available \nfrom various Global and Regional Climate Models (GCMs and RCMs). There are many \nsources of uncertainty in a climate change impact study, and this paper does not claim \nto cover all of them comprehensibly. However, it does demonstrate and compare the \nuncertainty in the flood frequency impact for a large number of possible sources (for \ntwo example catchments in England); more than any previous studies of which we are \naware. The sources of uncertainty are described in more detail below. Those being \nconsidered are: future greenhouse gas emissions; GCM structure; downscaling from \nGCMs (including RCM structure); hydrological model structure; hydrological model \nparameters. The effect of the internal variability of the climate system is also \nconsidered. The study uses the PDM rainfall-runoff model (Moore 1985, 2007), and all \nmodelling is done for the present and for the 2080s time-slice (2071-2100). \n \nSeveral studies have looked at the effect of different sources of uncertainty on \nprecipitation, and greater uncertainties in precipitation might be expected to lead to \ngreater uncertainties in flows. Rowell (2006) used PRUDENCE data \n(http:\/\/prudence.dmi.dk) to compare the effect of different sources of uncertainty \n(emissions scenario, GCM, RCM, and initial condition ensemble) on changes in \nseasonal surface air temperature (SAT) and precipitation over the UK. For both \nvariables, and in all seasons, it was found that uncertainty from GCM formulation was \nthe largest. Uncertainty from the RCM formulation was found to be largest in the \nsummer, but similar in size to that from internal variability and, for precipitation, \ngreater that than due to choice of emissions scenario. Other work using PRUDENCE \ndata includes propagation through hydrological models to river flows (Graham et al. \n2007a, b) and also demonstrates larger uncertainties due to choice of GCM as against \nRCM or emissions scenario. However, it should be noted that the uncertainty from \nGCM formulation is unlikely to represent the full range of possibilities in the \nPRUDENCE work, as data were only available from two different GCMs (with the \nsame nested RCM). Similarly, emissions uncertainty will be underestimated as data \nwere only available from two scenarios (A2 and B2), which do not span the full SRES \nrange (IPCC, 2000). Studies of changes in global mean rainfall from different GCMs \nand emissions scenarios suggest that GCM uncertainty dominates emissions uncertainty \n(Jenkins and Lowe, 2003). \n \nPrevious work on uncertainty in the impact of climate change on flooding includes that \nof Reynard et al. (2004), for 10 British catchments, which finds that emissions \nuncertainty (four UKCIP02 scenarios; see Section 3.1) is less important than \ndownscaling uncertainty. Cameron (2006) also uses the UKCIP02 scenarios, for a \ncatchment in Scotland, as well as two additional scenarios (\u2018H-wet\u2019 and \u2018H-dry\u2019) based \non the range of GCM uncertainty for the High emissions scenario. He also considers \nnatural variability, through the use of a stochastic rainfall model, and finds that the \nrange of changes from the additional \u2018H-wet\u2019 scenario is beyond the range of current \nnatural variability, whereas changes under the other five scenarios show a significant \noverlap with current natural variability. This emphasises both the need to consider more \n 3 \nthan one GCM (with GCM uncertainty suggested to be much wider than emissions \nuncertainty), and to put the changes in context with a demonstration of natural \nvariability. The latter was also demonstrated by Cameron et al. (2000) for the flood \nfrequency of a catchment in Wales, and by Arnell (2003) for mean monthly flows of six \ncatchments in Britain. Booij (2005) found, for changes in flood frequency for a large \nriver basin in Western Europe, that the uncertainty due to natural variability is \npotentially larger than that due to the use of data from different climate models (3 \nGCMs and 2 RCMs), but that the uncertainty due to hydrological model structure \n(different spatial resolutions of one model) or parameterisation is less important. \n \nRecent work looking at the uncertainty in the impact of climate change on water \nresources (monthly mean flows) for four catchments in Britain (Prudhomme and Davies \n2008) suggested that GCM uncertainty (from 3 GCMs) was the largest source of \nuncertainty, with downscaling uncertainty also significant. Hydrological uncertainty \nwas found to vary significantly between catchments. Emissions uncertainty was not \nfound to be significant, but only two emissions scenarios (A2 and B2) were used and \nthe time-slice under consideration was the 2020s; emissions uncertainty will be higher \nfor later time-slices. A European-scale study of changes in mean runoff for the 2050s \n(Arnell, 1999) also concluded that, in general, the greatest uncertainty comes from \nGCMs, with less from hydrological modelling (although the impact in some parts of \nmainland Europe showed high sensitivity to the value of a particular model parameter). \nWilby (2005) investigated the impact of climate change on monthly mean flows for the \nThames, particularly looking at the effect of parameter uncertainty from the conceptual \nwater balance model. He found that calibration uncertainty was comparable in size to \nemissions uncertainty (even for the 2080s), although only two emissions scenarios (A2 \nand B2) were used. GCM uncertainty was not assessed. However, Wilby et al. (2006) \nlooked at changes in daily discharge for the Kennet (which flows into the Thames at \nReading, UK) with three GCMs (using statistical downscaling) under two emissions \nscenarios (A2 and B2), and showed that the uncertainty due to choice of GCM is greater \nthan that from emissions. The most thorough study so far, in terms of inclusion of the \nmost sources of uncertainty, is probably that of Wilby and Harris (2006), who apply \nfour GCMs, two emissions scenarios, two statistical downscaling techniques, two \nhydrological model structures and two sets of hydrological model parameters, in a study \nof the impact on low flows in the Thames. They conclude that the results are most \nsensitive to the choice of GCM and downscaling method, and less sensitive to the \nchoice of hydrological model parameters or emissions scenario. \n \nThis study aims to provide a comparison of six sources of uncertainty, in terms of the \nimpact of climate change on flood frequency. Section 2 outlines the basic methodology \napplied, including a brief description of the hydrological model, and presents the two \ncatchments in England used for demonstration purposes. Section 3 describes the sources \nof uncertainty considered, and gives more detail on their precise application, whilst \nSection 4 presents results of the single-propagation of these sources through to the \nimpact of climate change on flood frequency. It compares the size and position of the \nimpact ranges for the different sources, and shows how these relate to natural \nvariability. Multi-propagation is not attempted. Conclusions are given in Section 5.  \n \n 4 \n2. Methodology \n2.1 Hydrological model \nThe main hydrological model used is the Probability Distributed Model (PDM; Moore \n1985, 2007), which is a flexible, conceptual rainfall-runoff model, requiring inputs of \ncatchment-average rainfall and potential evaporation. The model has been widely \napplied in Britain and forms part of the River Flow Forecasting System (Moore et al. \n2005). The version used here has five catchment-specific parameters, four of which \nrequire calibration (the fifth is set using soils data). See Kay et al. (2007) for more detail \non this version of the model, its parameters and calibration. A second hydrological \nmodel is used for the demonstration of impact uncertainty due to hydrological model \nstructure. This is described in Section 3.4 \n \n2.2 Catchments and baseline data \nThe two example catchments, part of the UK National River Flow Archive \n(www.ceh.ac.uk\/data\/nrfa\/), are catchment 40005 (the Beult at Stile Bridge, in South \nEast England) and 74001 (the Duddon at Duddon Hall, in North West England). Their \nlocations are shown on the map in Figure 1, and some details of the catchments are \ngiven in Table 1. Both catchments are essentially rural, but are very different in terms of \narea, rainfall regime and topography. These factors, as well as location (amongst other \nthings), mean a differing impact of climate change.  \n \nHourly catchment average rainfall series are available for each catchment, for the period \n1985-2001. These have been derived from data from all available daily raingauges \nwithin\/near the catchments, with the sub-daily distribution determined by more limited \namounts of quality-checked hourly rainfall data. Rainfall on days with no good quality \nhourly data is distributed using a set of catchment average profiles, derived using the \naverage variability method (Pilgrim et al. 1969). \n \nMORECS (Meteorological Office Rainfall and Evaporation Calculation System) \nmonthly data (Thompson et al. 1982; Hough et al. 1996) are used to provide catchment \npotential evaporation (PE) inputs. These data are based on the Penman-Monteith \nequation for PE (Monteith, 1965) and are readily available as average values for 201 \n40 km \u00d7 40 km grid squares across Great Britain. The monthly PE for a catchment is \nproduced by weighting the PE data for each MORECS grid square by the proportion of \nthe catchment in that square, and then summing over the squares. The monthly values \nare then disaggregated equally down to the required input time-step of the model. \n \n2.3 Flood frequency derivation and application of climate change scenarios  \nThe generic method used here to estimate the impact of climate change on flood \nfrequency is to drive the rainfall-runoff model with inputs (rainfall and PE data) \nrepresentative of a) current and b) potential future climate conditions. Flood frequency \ncurves are then derived from the resulting flow time-series, and the impact represented \nby the percentage change in flood magnitude (current to future) at several different \nreturn periods. Note that the flood magnitude with a return period of T years is that \nwhich might be expected to be equalled or exceeded, on average, once every T years, \ni.e. with an average interval of T years. \n \nFigure 1 \nTable 1 \n 5 \nIn the derivation of flood frequency from time-series, peaks-over-threshold (POT) are \npreferred over annual maxima, as they make more use of the data (see Begueria (2005) \nfor a discussion). Here, peaks are extracted at an average rate of three per year (i.e. the \npeak threshold is implicit), with standard independence criteria applied (Bayliss and \nJones, 1992). The magnitudes of the POT are fitted using the generalised Pareto \ndistribution with the peak arrival times assumed to correspond to a Poisson distribution \n(Naden, 1992), and fitting is carried out using the method of probability-weighted \nmoments (Hosking and Wallis, 1987).  \n \nHere, the current climate conditions are generally those given by the (observed) baseline \nrainfall and PE data (for the 17-year period 1985-2001; Section 2.2), and the future \nclimate conditions are given by adjusting the baseline data according to various climate \nchange scenarios; often termed the \u2018delta change method\u2019. That is, percentage changes \nin monthly mean rainfall (and PE) are derived from sets of current\/future scenario data \n(e.g. from GCMs), and these are applied to the baseline data at each time-step (often \ndaily or sub-daily). Variations on this simple application are clearly possible \n(Prudhomme et al. 2002), for example only enhancing the larger storms, but there is no \nright or wrong answer to how it should be done. Here then, the straightforward delta \nchange method has been used in most cases, but some results using other downscaling \nmethods are also presented, to demonstrate downscaling uncertainty (Section 3.3). \n \nA major advantage of using the delta change method is the ease with which alternative \nemissions scenarios, or those based on alternative GCMs etc., can be applied. A \ndisadvantage is that it is highly dependent on the variability and ordering of events \nwithin the (relatively short) baseline period, and does not allow for changes in \nvariability (which can have a major impact, e.g. Arnell et al. 2003). This is explored in \nSection 3.6. \n \n2.4 Impact definition \nThe impact of climate change on flood frequency is often defined by the percentage \nchange in a flood peak of a given return period, but there is no single figure for the \nimpact at any location as this is likely to differ by return period. The impact is also \ndependent on the future time-slice under consideration, as would be expected. However, \nnot only is this dependence not necessarily linear, but the direction of change may not \nbe consistent between time-slices: Under a given emissions scenario, downscaling \nmethod, hydrological model etc., some catchments can show an increase in flood \nfrequency to the 2050s but a decrease by the 2080s, or vice-versa (Reynard et al. 2004). \nThis is likely to be due to the balance between increased winter rainfall and decreased \nsummer rainfall in the climate scenarios considered in that study, with higher \ntemperatures and so increased evaporation, meaning higher soil moisture deficits which \nhave to be refilled before flooding can occur. Only the change by the 2080s is \nconsidered here. \n \nA further complication in the definition of the impact is the time-step or averaging \nperiod used to extract POT: the flood frequency curve based on hourly instantaneous \nflows will differ from that based on daily or monthly mean flows, and so too might the \npercentage changes in these curves from current to future time-slices. Here, the impact \nwill be defined by the change in the flood magnitude at five return periods (2, 5 10, 20 \n 6 \nand 50 years), where the flood frequency curve has been fitted to peaks extracted from \nhourly flow data. \n \nFurthermore, it should be recognised that there is uncertainty in the fitting of a flood \nfrequency curve to point data. This is particularly true where there are \u2018outlier\u2019 events in \nthe point series, or where a catchment\u2019s flood events can be generated by very different \nprocesses (e.g. by seasonal variation in flood-production mechanisms) (Alila and \nMtiraoui, 2002). It is for this reason that the flood frequency curve is not intended for \nextrapolation to significantly higher return periods, but simply to interpolate and smooth \nthe point data. Note that the results presented here for the 50-year return period are a \nslight extrapolation, given the data availability for the example catchments, and should \nthus be treated with caution. Plotting the extracted peaks along with the fitted curve \nallows a visual assessment of the homogeneity of the points. A particular problem to \nbear in mind is the potential presence of \u2018outliers\u2019 in either the current or future flood \npeaks when RCM data are used directly, as their part-stochastic nature with initial-\ncondition uncertainty (essentially a demonstration of natural variability) could generate \nextreme events which significantly affect the modelled change in flood frequency (Bell \net al., 2007b). This problem would be solved by the availability of large RCM \nensembles. \n \n3. Sources of uncertainty and their application \n3.1 Future greenhouse gas emissions \nThe UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) selected one emissions scenario from \neach of the four SRES storylines (IPCC, 2000), for their latest set of climate change \nscenarios for the UK (UKCIP02; Hulme et al. 2002). The selection was made so as to \nspan the range of SRES scenarios well; for the A1 storyline, the highest emissions \nscenario was selected (A1F1). The emissions scenarios termed High, Medium-High, \nMedium-Low and Low in UKCIP02 correspond, respectively, to the SRES A1F1, A2, \nB2 and B1 emissions scenarios. However, the impact of these emissions on UK climate \nwas only specifically modelled for a single scenario and time-slice, A2 (Medium-High) \n2080s, using a three member ensemble of the Hadley Centre RCM HadRM3H; the \nimpact under the other three emissions scenarios and additional time-slices was pattern-\nscaled from the A2 HadRM3H ensemble mean using the change in global temperature \nfrom the corresponding runs of the GCM, HadCM3.  \n \nThe UKCIP02 scenarios are available as monthly (percentage or absolute) changes \n(from the 1961-1990 baseline) in various climate variables for a 50 x 50 km grid over \nthe UK. Rainfall changes are directly available but the hydrological model also requires \ninput time-series of potential evaporation (PE), which are not available directly from \nUKCIP02. The Penman-Monteith equation has thus been used to estimate changes in \nPE from those of other variables, for consistency with the baseline PE data \n(Section 2.2). This calculation involves temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and \nnet surface long and short wave radiation, changes in which are available for the \nUKCIP02 scenarios. The simple delta change method (Section 2.3) is used here to apply \nthe monthly percentage changes in rainfall and PE, derived from each UKCIP02 \nscenario, to the baseline hourly data for the catchments. \n \n 7 \n3.2 GCM structure \nThere are a number of GCMs, developed and run in various countries across the globe, \nwhich generally project different climate changes when forced by a given emissions \nscenario. Not only do they have different climate sensitivities (the change in global \nmean temperature under a doubling of CO2) but they show different patterns of change \nin temperature and precipitation (see Figures 24-27 of Hulme et al. (2002) for patterns \nof change in winter and summer temperature and precipitation across the UK, under 9 \ndifferent GCMs). Information on changes in various climate variables under future \nemissions scenarios, from a number of GCMs, was obtained from the IPCC data \ndistribution centre (ipcc-ddc.cru.uea.ac.uk). \n \nAs for the UKCIP02 scenarios, PE is not a direct output of GCMs and so Penman-\nMonteith PE has been calculated from other variables for each of the GCMs. Note \nthough that not all of the GCMs provide directly usable variables for the calculation of \nPE, so substitutes sometimes have to be used. Even when the required variables are \navailable, the calculated monthly PE may not seem realistic, possibly due to errors \nresulting from the coarse resolution of the GCMs. \n \nThe 5 GCMs represented here are HadCM3 (UK), CSIRO-Mk2 (Australia), CGCM2 \n(Canada), ECHAM4 (Germany) and CCSR (Japan). These are a subset of the models \nthat contributed to the IPCC Third Assessment Report (IPCC 2001); the others each \nlack some of the data required for this application. The delta change method is used to \napply monthly percentage changes in rainfall and PE, derived from each of the GCMs, \nto the baseline hourly data for the catchments. \n \nGCMs also use parameterisations, to deal with processes that occur on scales smaller \nthan the grid resolution of the GCM (e.g. schemes to estimate the amount of cloud). \nSome of these schemes are well-constrained (by observations) but others are less well \nunderstood, hence the uncertainty due to parameterisation could be important (Murphy \net al. 2004). However, GCM parameterisation uncertainty is not covered here due to a \nlack of readily-available data from a perturbed physics ensemble at the time of writing. \nWork in this area is evolving quickly though, as demonstrated by New et al. (2007) who \nuse initial results from the climateprediction.net experiment (Stainforth et al. 2005) to \ndemonstrate that the uncertainty from this perturbed-physics ensemble dominates that \nfrom hydrological model uncertainty, when modelling changes in the median flow of \nthe Thames at Teddington. \n \n3.3 Downscaling from GCMs \nThe coarse spatial resolution of GCMs, and the greater uncertainty in their outputs at \nfine temporal resolution, means that they are generally not appropriate for finer scale \nimpacts modelling, like flooding. However, the more recent use of RCMs, nested within \nGCMs, provides dynamic downscaling to a more appropriate temporal and spatial scale \n(especially for precipitation; Durman et al. 2001). Previously the delta change method \nwas often used as an alternative to direct use of GCM data (e.g. Prudhomme et al. \n2002), and this is applied here alongside other downscaling methods, including direct \nuse of RCM data, to demonstrate downscaling uncertainty. \n \n 8 \n3.3.1 Delta change versus direct use of RCM data \nThe first comparison is between three variations on the delta change method and the \ndirect use of data from an RCM. Two of the delta change methods use different data \nsources to determine the monthly percentage changes that are applied; the first uses \nGCM (HadCM3) data while the second uses RCM (UKCIP02\/HadRM3H) data (that is, \nincluding dynamic downscaling from the GCM scale down to the RCM scale). These \nchanges are applied to the baseline hourly rainfall and PE through the simple \napplication of the monthly percentage changes to each hour of baseline data according \nto month. However, this does not allow for more complex changes in rainfall \ndistributions. Reynard et al. (2004) developed an extended version of the delta change \nmethod which aims to match changes in daily rainfall intensity as well as percentage \nchanges in monthly means (PE is still adjusted simply through changes in monthly \nmeans), and it is this which is applied in the third version of the delta change method, \nagain using changes derived from UKCIP02 RCM data.  \n \nBriefly, this extended delta change method uses an indicator of the change in frequency \nof the 20-year return period rainfall for each of the four seasons, and the precise way in \nwhich the monthly percentage changes in rainfall are applied depends upon the value of \nthe corresponding seasonal indicator. For instance, an increase in mean rainfall for a \ncertain month is applied differently if there is also a significant increase in the 20-year \nreturn period rainfall (when larger storms will be further enhanced) than if there is a \nsignificant decrease (when larger storms will be reduced). \n \nThe final of the four methods uses data directly from an RCM (25km HadRM3H) to \nderive rainfall and PE inputs for the hydrological model (Kay et al. 2006a, b). This \nRCM is the same as that used for UKCIP02, but with a further improvement in the \ntemporal and spatial resolution (hourly precipitation data on a ~25 km grid). The RCM \nwas driven by the same boundary conditions used for the first member of the UKCIP02 \nSRES A2 ensemble i.e, providing a rerun of this experiment at double the horizontal \nresolution. Application here involves the direct use of RCM data for both current (1961-\n1990) and future (2071-2100) time-slices, looking at changes between flood frequency \nresults for the two periods, as bias in the RCM data means that it is generally not \nappropriate to consider changes from an observed flood frequency curve.  \n \nOther studies have attempted to correct for bias in RCM data by deriving linear error \nfactors from a comparison of current time-slice data with observed data (on annual, \nseasonal or monthly bases), and then applying these factors to the future time-slice data \nbefore feeding it into an impact model (e.g. Graham et al. 2007a, Thodsen 2007, Fowler \nand Kilsby 2007). However, care must be taken when applying such methods, \nespecially for flood frequency estimation: Leander and Buishand (2007) show that \nsimple linear bias-correction can lead to worse reproduction of flood frequency than no \ncorrection at all, and instead apply a nonlinear power transformation. Graham et \nal. (2007b) caution that \u2018\u2026one must keep in mind the alterations made to the RCM \nresults, and the important assumption that RCM model biases in the future are \nsystematically the same as in the control climate. The more scaling applied, the further \naway one gets from \u201cdirect\u201d use of the RCM\u2019. No scaling has been applied to the 25 km \nresolution RCM data used here. \n \n 9 \n3.3.2 RCM structure \nThe second comparison is between different dynamic downscaling models, here \nrepresented by different RCMs nested in the same GCM. These have been obtained \nfrom the PRUDENCE project (Christensen et al. 2007), which produced high-resolution \nclimate change scenarios for Europe (for 2071-2100) based on the use of different \nRCMs nested within the Hadley Centre GCM HadAM3H (essentially reruns of \nUKCIP02 experiments with different RCMs). Eight RCMs are used, from the Hadley \nCentre (UK), DMI (Denmark), ETH (Switzerland), GKSS (Germany), MPI (Germany), \nSMHI (Sweden), UCM (Spain) and KNMI (Netherlands). Jacob et al. (2007) and Deque \net al. (2007) provide brief descriptions of each of these RCMs, with further references \nfrom which more detail can be obtained, along with descriptions of model performance \nfor present-day climate and of uncertainties in model projections for temperature and \nprecipitation. Included in this comparison is the more recent Hadley Centre RCM, \nHadRM3P driven by (the high resolution version of) HadAM3P (Jones et al. 2008) in a \nseries of experiments parallel to those run for UKCIP02. HadAM3P is an updated \nversion of HadAM3H providing some improvements in its global climatology but with \nsimilar global and European responses to climate change. \n \nFor each of these RCMs, changes in mean monthly rainfall can be calculated directly \nfrom the monthly time-series of rainfall available for the control and scenario time-\nslices (2080s, A2 emissions). However, the calculation of changes in mean monthly PE \ninvolves an initial calculation of monthly time-series of PE from monthly time-series of \nother meteorological variables, using the Penman-Monteith formulation as for \nUKCIP02 data. Here, the variables used were generally those of temperature, wind \nspeed, dew point temperature and net surface long and short wave radiation, but for \nsome RCMs specific humidity had to be used as dew point temperature was not \navailable. The simple delta change method has been used to apply the changes \ncalculated from each RCM to baseline catchment rainfall and PE. \n \nNote that one PRUDENCE RCM (that of ICTP (Italy)) could not be used due to lack of \navailable wind speed data, meaning that Penman-Monteith PE could not be calculated. \nAlternative, simpler, formulations of PE could have been applied (Oudin et al. 2005), in \nparticular one of a number involving just temperature in the calculation. However, in a \nclimate change context, the inclusion of other meteorological variables could be critical \nin terms of changes in them affecting the changes in PE. Arnell (1999) investigated the \nsensitivity of modelled changes in runoff, under a given climate change scenario, to PE \nformulation, on a European scale. He compared two PE formulae, Penman-Monteith \nand Priestly-Taylor (the latter of which does not specifically include humidity and wind \nspeed), and found that, whilst giving similar estimates of current runoff, they predicted \ndiffering changes in runoff, even of different directions in a number of regions \n(including South-East England). \n \nFor the set of RCMs used here, for catchment 40005 in south-east England, changes in \nPE calculated using the purely temperature-based formula suggested by Oudin et al. \n(2005) range between +13% (spring) and +26% (winter) whereas those calculated using \nthe Penman-Monteith formulation range between -16% (autumn) and +75% (summer). \nThus the range of changes is greatly increased when other variables are included, and \nthe seasonal distribution of changes also differs. This could certainly affect water \n 10 \nresource impacts, but could also affect flood impacts through changes in the balance of \nrainfall and PE. An initial investigation using these two PE formulations suggests that \nthe effect here is relatively small compared to other sources of uncertainty (not shown), \nbut it is still important to use a consistent formulation for calculating PE throughout the \nanalysis. The calculation of PE from climate model data, and the resulting hydrological \nuncertainty, will be explored further in future work. One potential problem could be the \nreliability of the additional variables required for the calculation Penman-Monteith PE, \nwhen these are derived from RCMs. This is discussed by Ekstrom et al. (2007) with \nregard to data from HadRM3H.  \n \n3.4 Hydrological model structure \nThere are numerous hydrological models, each of which could be used to assess the \neffect of climate change on flows. No model is perfect in its representation of reality, \nand the choice of model must be based on, for instance, study aims, performance under \ncurrent conditions for required catchments\/areas, data requirements etc.  \n \nHere, results from the 5-parameter PDM (Section 2.1) will be compared to those from a \nsecond model, the Grid-to-Grid (G2G; Bell et al. 2007a). The latter is a grid-based \nrunoff and routing model, requiring gridded inputs of rainfall and potential evaporation, \nwhich has been formulated on a 1km grid over the UK. Its parameters are determined \nthrough the use of spatial data sets alongside either catchment or area-wide calibration; \narea-wide calibrations have been used here. \n \nBoth the PDM and the G2G models have been driven directly with data from an hourly \nRCM (25km HadRM3H) for current (1961-1990) and future (2071-2100, A2 emissions \nscenario) time-slices. Information on the finer-scale spatial variation of rainfall (via the \nuse of standard annual average rainfall data available on a 1 x 1 km grid over Britain) is \nused to convert data from the 25km RCM grid to the catchment average rainfall \nrequired by the PDM (see Kay et al. 2006b), or to the 1km gridded rainfall required by \nthe G2G (see Bell et al. 2007a). Any difference in the results from the two models is \ntherefore predominantly due to inherent differences in model structure, rather than input \ndata. \n \n3.5 Hydrological model parameters \nHydrological model parameters that require calibration will be uncertain. A different \nmethod of fitting, or using a different measure of fit (objective function), will likely \nresult in different calibrated parameter values. This is particularly true where there is \nany sort of interdependence between parameters. In addition, data quality, for both input \ndata (rainfall and potential evaporation) and calibration data (observed flows), could \naffect calibration performance, as could data quantity. There must be a sufficient length \nof data, covering a range of flow regimes, for calibration to be effective. The calibrated \nparameters will thus differ to some extent according to the data used for calibration. \nUncertainty in the observed flow data used for calibration, especially for high flows, \nshould also be borne in mind. \n \nThere are various ways in which calibration uncertainty can be systematically \ninvestigated. The method applied here, for the PDM, is a variation on the statistical \ntechnique of jack-knifing (Shao and Tu, 1995). This involves the generation of a \n 11 \nnumber of different calibrated parameter sets, each based on slightly different data: one \nwhole year of observed flow data is ignored (set as missing) in the generation of each \nset (all input data are retained, to preserve the year-to-year water balance). Thus N years \nof data leads to N+1 calibrated parameter sets (one based on the use of all the data). \nEach set has then been used with the baseline input data and with inputs adjusted by the \ndelta change method (UKCIP02 Medium-High 2080s), and the change in flood \nfrequency calculated for each pair at specific return periods. Error bars are then \nconstructed by estimating the variance (\u03c3\n2\n) from the values of the jack-knifed flood \nfrequency changes at each return period. The 95% error bars can then be plotted as \n\u00b5\u00b12\u03c3, where \u00b5 is the mean of the jack-knifed values. However, jack-knife theory \nrequires that the variance be calculated slightly differently to a usual sample (with a \nmultiplier of (N-1)\/N rather than 1\/N), and this inflates the size of the error bars.  \n \n3.6 Internal variability of the climate system  \nAll of the above sources of uncertainty derive from our representation of the physical \nsystems we are modelling and the drivers of change in those systems. In each case, the \nuncertainty is assessed by either applying different representations of current and future \nclimates to a hydrological model or one representation of current and future climate to \ndifferent hydrological models. Due to the natural internal variability of the climate \nsystem, the representation used of each of these climates will not be unique. Using an \nalternative, equally valid, representation would produce different results. It is thus \nimportant that we explore the range of different hydrological responses that could be \nobtained by our finite sampling of the internal variability of the climate system. This \nwill allow us to assess the importance of the other sources of uncertainty. \n \nTwo ways of assessing the effect of climate variability are explored. The first uses the \nmodel-based approach of running an ensemble of climate model integrations started \nfrom different initial conditions, with the climate model and its forcings identical in \neach integration. Each then evolves a different but plausible evolution of the climate and \nsampling from these allows us to explore the implication of internal variability. For \nUKCIP02 this was done using a three-member ensemble (see Figures 24-27 of Hulme et \nal. 2002). To demonstrate this source of uncertainty here, data were obtained from the \nEU-funded PRUDENCE project (Christensen et al. 2007; http:\/\/prudence.dmi.dk), for \nthe Hadley Centre RCM HadRM3P nested in a three-member initial condition ensemble \nof the Hadley Centre GCM HadAM3P (2080s, A2 emissions scenario). The delta \nchange method is used to apply monthly percentage changes in rainfall and PE, derived \nfrom each RCM experiment in the ensemble, to the baseline hourly data for the \ncatchments. It should be noted however that such model-based climate variability \nensembles only give a modelled estimate of natural variability, which may or may not \nbe representative of real variability (Section 7.7 of Hulme et al. 2002) and which will \ndiffer between GCMs (e.g. Ruosteenoja et al. 2003). Also, it is too computationally \nexpensive to run very large GCM\/RCM ensembles. \n \nOne alternative for assessing the effect of climate variability is to use some form of \nstochastic rainfall model to generate a large number of rainfall time-series for the \ncurrent or future climates (e.g. Cameron 2006, Kilsby et al. 2007). However, such use \nwould require significant checking of the performance of the rainfall model under \ncurrent conditions, in terms of its ability to simulate extremes at the required time-step \n 12 \nas well as its replication of the seasonal cycle etc. In addition, there is usually an \nassumption that features of the model fitted to the current climate are still valid under a \nfuture climate. \n \nHere then, the second way used to explore the effect of climate variability is to apply a \nsimple and pragmatic resampling of rainfall series to produce a large number of new \nrainfall series. Monthly resampling involves the formation of new time-series through \nthe random selection of rainfall, month by month, from the original series. For example, \nfrom a baseline series for January 1985 - December 2000, a new series would be created \nby first selecting a January from any of those in the baseline period, to represent January \n1985, then selecting any February to represent February 1985, and so on until a series of \nthe same length as the original is created. The months are selected with replacement, so \nthat the rainfall for the same month could be repeated in any one of the resampled \nseries, and some months may not be used at all. Resampling by month or season (3-\nmonth blocks) limits the effect of time-correlation (autocorrelation) in rainfall series \n(e.g. dependence of daily rainfall on the rainfall of preceding days). It does not allow for \nvariation in the short term extremes (e.g. hourly\/daily maxima etc.), but does allow \nvariation in longer term accumulations by, for instance, meaning that a wet winter can \npotentially follow a wet autumn (which may not have occurred within the original time \nseries). Thus, in addition to creating plausible new rainfall series, this approach \naddresses an issue with the delta change method of downscaling, which is highly \ndependent on the variability and ordering of events within the (relatively short) baseline \nperiod. In particular, the sequencing of wet and dry seasons and years could have a \nsignificant effect on the flood frequency, so the resampling method essentially \ndemonstrates the potential effect of natural variability in antecedent conditions. The \nmethod will not, however, address the issue of the effects of multi-decadal variability \n(Kendon et al. 2008), which the initial condition climate model ensemble approach can \naddress. Resampling thus represents a simple proxy for the effect of medium-frequency \nnatural variability. \n \nResampling under the current climate allows the representativeness of the original \nbaseline series to be assessed, by comparison against the median and bounds from the \nset of resampled series. Resampling under the current and future climates allows the \npotential range due to natural variability under the current climate to be compared to the \nrange of changes that might be expected under climate change. Accordingly, a set of \n100 resampled rainfall series have been produced for both the current and future \nclimate, with resampling in 3-month blocks, and the model run with each new rainfall \nseries. The future climate uses the simple delta change method to adjust the baseline \nrainfall and PE according to the UKCIP02 medium-high emissions scenario for the \n2080s. The median flood frequency curve and its upper and lower 90% bounds have \nthen been calculated for each return period. \n \n4. Results \n4.1 Natural variability \nAssessing the importance of natural variability from resampling observed rainfall \nindicates it has a significant influence for both catchments, but larger (in terms of \npercentage changes) for catchment 40005, particularly at higher return periods (Table \n2). The smaller effect for catchment 74001 could be due to the fact that the resampling \n 13 \nmethod only allows variation in longer term extremes (seasonal rainfall amounts), as the \nlonger memory of larger, flatter catchments, like 40005, means that variation in longer \nterm extremes has a greater effect on them than on more responsive (small, steep) \ncatchments, like 74001. In contrast, variation of shorter term extremes would have a \ngreater effect on more responsive catchments. \n \nHowever, the effect of climate change could be much more significant, in comparison \nwith natural variability, for catchment 74001 as its \u2018Future\u2019 bounds are consistently \nshifted upwards compared to the \u2018Current\u2019 bounds, whereas the \u2018Future\u2019 bounds for \ncatchment 40005 are almost completely contained within its \u2018Current\u2019 bounds \n(Figure 2). This is consistent with the results of Hulme et al. (1999), who looked at the \npotential changes in mean annual runoff over Europe by the 2050s and compared these \nto natural variability. They found a band across central Europe, including southern \nBritain, where the effect of climate change was less than that of natural variability, \nwhereas regions further north or south had a more pronounced climate change effect \ncompared to natural variability. For both of our catchments though, natural variability \ncould be a significant factor in the future experience of flooding, with or without \nclimate change (the potential, versus the actual). Hulme et al. (1999) point out that, for \nsome sectors, adapting management systems to withstand natural climate variability \nmay be sufficient to also withstand climate change, in some regions and for the \nmedium-term, but this may not be sufficient in other regions or for the longer term. \n \nThe results for current and future natural variability using resampling are used in \nFigure 3 (plotted as median with 90% error bars) to provide context for the ranges of \nimpacts of climate change on flood frequency from the other sources of uncertainty \ndescribed in Section 3. The ranges are shown at five different return periods (2, 5, 10, \n20 and 50 years) and are calculated as the percentage change from the simulated \nbaseline flood frequency (i.e. that simulated using the observed input data) except for \nthe downscaling example using RCM data directly, where the change is calculated from \nthe RCM-simulated baseline (see Section 3.3.1). The figure distinguishes between sets \n(different sources of uncertainty) but does not indicate which member of each set is \nwhich (although this is discussed to some extent below). However, the results \ndemonstrating uncertainty from hydrological model parameters are shown by the mean \nand the 95% error bars, rather than as a separate point for each jack-knifed parameter set \n(see Section 3.5).  \n \nIncluded in Figure 3 are the results for future natural variability using the GCM\/RCM \ninitial condition ensemble (see Section 3.6). These are consistent with those for future \nnatural variability using resampling, and are generally well-contained within the ranges \nof the latter. The exception is lower return periods (<10 years) for catchment 40005, \nwhere the impact from one ensemble member is slightly above the upper 90% bound \nfrom the resampling. The ordering of the effect of the three ensemble members differs \nbetween the two catchments, although the third ensemble member generally has the \ngreatest effect on both (at least at lower return periods).  \n \n4.2 Uncertainty ranges from physical system models and their drivers \nThe other results presented in Figure 3 indicate that: \nTable 2 \nFigure 2 \nFigure 3 \n 14 \n\u2022 Uncertainty due to emissions is very low for catchment 40005, but more important \nfor catchment 74001.  \n\u2022 GCM uncertainty could be quite important for both catchments, although the GCM \nresulting in the highest increase in flood frequency for both catchments, CCSR, is \nquite extreme (compared to the other GCMs used) in terms of the increase in winter \nrainfall that it predicts for the UK (see Figures 26 and 28 of Hulme et al. 2002). The \nordering of the effect of other GCMs differs between the two catchments. \n\u2022 The three delta change downscaling methods show very similar results, with a \ndecrease in flood frequency at higher return periods for catchment 40005, and an \nincrease in flood frequency at all return periods for catchment 74001. Results from \nthe direct use of RCM data show similar decreases for 40005 and increases for \n74001. \n\u2022 The results for the eight RCMs show a similar pattern of change, with an increase at \nlower return periods and a decrease (or lower percentage increase) at higher return \nperiods for catchment 40005, whilst for catchment 74001 there is an increase at \nmost return periods which is larger for higher return periods. However, the ordering \nof the impacts from the eight RCMs is different for each catchment, with the UCM \nRCM generally showing the greatest effect for catchment 40005 (although the \nGKSS and MPI RCMs take over at higher return periods) but the MPI RCM \nshowing the greatest effect (at all return periods) for catchment 74001. Similarly, the \nDMI RCM generally shows the least effect for catchment 40005 while the Hadley \nRCM shows the least effect (at all return periods) for catchment 74001.  \n\u2022 The two hydrological models compare very well, and show the same pattern of a \ndecrease in flood frequency change with return period for catchment 40005, and a \nmore uniform flood frequency change with return period for catchment 74001.  \n\u2022 There is a very small effect from hydrological model parameter uncertainty. \n \n4.3 Comparison of uncertainty ranges \nThe ranges of impact shown in Figure 3 overlap to a good extent, but their sizes vary \nquite considerably. This is illustrated in Figure 4, which shows bar charts of the impact \nrange sizes based on the data points plotted in Figure 3.  \n \nWhen all of the data points are included, GCM structure is the dominant source of \nuncertainty (Figure 4a). However, when the data points for the most extreme GCM \n(CCSR) are excluded, the uncertainty due to GCM structure becomes more similar in \nsize to that from other sources of uncertainty (Figure 4b). Although the uncertainty from \nhydrological model parameters is seemingly the smallest in most cases, the ordering of \nthe other sources varies by return period and between the two catchments. \n \nTable 3 shows the ordering of the sources when the size of the impact range is averaged \nover the five illustrated return periods (when the CCSR GCM is excluded, Figure 4b; \n\u2018GCM structure\u2019 is promoted to number 1 in the list if this GCM is included). The more \ndominant sources of uncertainty in this case appear to be those related to the GCM or to \nthe method of downscaling from the GCM (including RCM structure). The uncertainty \nfrom hydrological model structure is higher for catchment 40005 than for catchment \n74001 probably because of the G2G\u2019s lower performance for catchments with a less \ntopographically-driven flow regime (Bell et al. 2007a), particularly with the area-wide \nparameters used here (rather than catchment-calibrated parameters).  \nFigure 4 \nTable 3 \n 15 \n \nThe impact ranges from GCMs and RCMs with different structure were derived using \ndata from single integrations of each climate model. As demonstrated with the \napplication of data from the GCM initial condition ensemble, the range of GCM \nstructure uncertainty could be narrowed or widened by accounting for natural \nvariability. This will also be the case with the range of RCM structure uncertainty, at \nleast in terms of the influence of fine-scale climate variability. (In general the RCMs \nadd fine-scale information to a large-scale solution mainly determined by the driving \nGCM thus it will be this aspect of climate variability that is relevant to the RCM \nstructure uncertainty range.) Thus when comparing the GCM and RCM-derived ranges \nthe estimates of uncertainty due to natural variability provide an estimate of the \nuncertainty in the magnitude of each range. \n \nThe application of a simple resampling technique showed that natural variability in \nantecedent conditions or seasonal climate could be important for both of the example \ncatchments and potentially even more important than climate change (at least up to the \n2080s) for catchment 40005. The size of the potential range of natural variability under \ncurrent conditions is actually comparable with the larger ranges from the various \nsources of climate change uncertainty: natural variability would appear at the top of the \nlist in Table 3 for catchment 40005 (second for catchment 74001), although the full \nrange of uncertainty from GCM structure exceeds that of natural variability for both \ncatchments. The positioning of the future changes relative to the bounds from current \nnatural variability is the crucial factor though, as is illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure 3.  \n \n5. Conclusions \nThis paper has discussed sources of uncertainty in climate change impact studies, with \nparticular reference to the impact of climate change on flood frequency in Britain. \nExamples were given of the single-propagation of the sources of uncertainty through to \ntheir range of impacts on flood frequency, for two catchments in England. Multi-\npropagation (that is, propagation of more than one source of uncertainty at once) was \nnot attempted, although this is what would be required for a full risk-based approach to \ndecision-making, along with estimated likelihoods of the different combinations. \n \nThe results from single-propagation of each of the sources of uncertainty suggested that \nuncertainty from GCM structure was the dominant source of uncertainty. However, this \nis due to the extremely large increases in winter rainfall predicted by one of the 5 GCMs \nused (CCSR). Omitting the results for this GCM led to other sources of uncertainty \nbecoming more significant, although uncertainty from sources relating to modelling of \nthe future climate was generally still larger than that relating to emissions or \nhydrological modelling. Natural variability could also play a significant role, and the \nuncertainty due to natural variability should be considered when comparing the \nuncertainties from the physical system models and their drivers.  \n \nThe results presented here are not conclusive as some of the sources of uncertainty are \nnot fully represented. For example \n\u2022 The range of emissions scenarios used (from UKCIP02) is not the full IPCC range \n(and the A1F1, B1 and B2 scenarios are scaled from the ensemble results for the A2 \nscenario). \n 16 \n\u2022 Only five GCMs are used to represent GCM structure uncertainty. More exist, but \nthere are difficulties either in terms of data availability or in the calculation of PE \nfor these. Also, ideally, the same RCM would be nested within each different GCM, \nto give the added-value of finer temporal and spatial resolution whilst demonstrating \nGCM structure uncertainty in a consistent way. \n\u2022 The use of simple delta change downscaling (Section 2.3) is likely to mean an \nunderestimation of the range of uncertainties simulated from RCM structure, for \nexample, as this method of downscaling concentrates on changes in mean climate \nand does allow for more complex changes in variability, which may differ between \nRCMs. \n\u2022 Only two models are used to represent hydrological model structure uncertainty, one \nof which (the G2G) has particular difficulty in flatter regions (Bell et al. 2007a). \nOngoing development of the G2G should improve its performance in such regions. \n\u2022 The uncertainty from hydrological model parameters is being represented through \nthe use of jack-knifed calibrated parameter sets, which cover the uncertainty from \ndata but not from equifinality (Beven 2001) etc. Thus the full effect of parameter \nuncertainty on flood frequency estimation is probably larger than that represented \nhere.  \n\u2022 Resampling in 3-month blocks is used as a simple proxy for natural variability, \nmainly by allowing for natural variability in antecedent conditions. Use of methods \nwhich allow for variation in shorter term extremes would likely result in wider \nranges of natural variability, particularly for more responsive catchments (like \n74001). \nAdditions would not necessarily increase the range of uncertainty from any source, but \nwould lead to more robust conclusions.  \n \nMore catchments need to be studied to determine anything conclusive about the \nimportance of different sources of uncertainty; whether overall or for different types of \ncatchment or different locations. However, the ordering here is consistent with the \nconclusions of studies of uncertainty in the impact of climate change on water resources \n(Arnell 1999, Prudhomme and Davies 2008, Wilby et al. 2006, Wilby and Harris 2006, \nGraham et al. 2007a, b) which each concluded that uncertainty from global climate \nmodelling is generally larger than that from other sources. Ideally though, ensemble \nexperiments using each GCM \/ RCM would be used to generate impact ensembles. \nTaking the mean impact for each would thus limit the \u2018noise\u2019 from natural variability \nthat is present within these uncertainty ranges. The use of an RCM perturbed-physics \nensemble is to be explored in the next phase of this research, as is the use of transient \nRCM runs (covering the period 1950 to 2100). The latter will enable a study of the \ndetectability of climate change impacts on river flows against the background of \n(modelled) natural variability. The detectability of climate change impacts amongst \nnatural variability is a problem which needs to be tackled so that policy-makers can be \nmore readily convinced of the need to factor climate change into their long-term plans at \nan early stage (Wilby 2006). \n \nAcknowledgements \nData from a number of GCMs were obtained from the IPCC data distribution centre \n(http:\/\/ipcc-ddc.cru.uea.ac.uk).
