Stoichiometric FeSi2 films,\n300\u2013400 nm thick, were deposited on \u0001100\u0002 Si substrates by co-sputtering of Fe and Si. It was\nfound that the films grow in an amorphous form for the substrate temperature ranging from room\ntemperature to 200 \u00b0C, while from 300\u2013700 \u00b0C, they grow in form of a crystalline \u0001-FeSi2 phase.\nIn a postdeposition 30 min heat treatments, the layers retain the amorphous structure up to 400 \u00b0C,\ntransforming to the crystalline \u0001 phase at 500\u2013700 \u00b0C. The results are discussed in the frame of the\nexisting models, and compared to those found in the literature. It is shown that in as-deposited films,\nthe growth is controlled by surface diffusion, the crystalline layers growing in a columnar structure\nstrongly correlated to the Si substrate. Postdeposition treatments induce a random crystallization\ncontrolled by bulk diffusion, the resulting structure not being influenced by the substrate. The results\nof this work contribute to a better understanding of the processes involved in a transition of\namorphous FeSi2 films to a crystalline phase, and provide a basis to determine the processing\nparameters in potential applications of this promising semiconducting material. \u00a9 2005 American\nInstitute of Physics. \u0003DOI: 10.1063\/1.2148629\u0004I. INTRODUCTION\nCrystalline \u0001-FeSi2 films have attracted significant atten-\ntion as a direct band gap semiconducting material, of Eg\n=0.85\u20130.87 eV.1,2 Such properties allowed successful fabri-\ncation of a silicon-based light-emitting device,3 consisting of\n\u0001-FeSi2 precipitates in a Si matrix, thus opening potential\nroutes for optical interconnects in silicon integrated circuit\ntechnology. Apart from this \u0001-FeSi2 has a high photoabsorp-\ntion coefficient, about 50 times higher than crystalline Si,\nmaking it suitable for fabrication of high efficiency solar\ncells.4 Recently, we have reported5,6 the existence of another\nsemiconductor: the amorphous form of FeSi2. The material\nwas initially synthesized by ion beam mixing of Fe films on\nSi substrates and later confirmed by co-sputter deposition of\niron and silicon.7 Amorphous FeSi2 is also a direct gap semi-\nconductor with a band gap of 0.88\u20130.90 eV, close to that of\na\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\nmestggs@brunel.ac.uk\n0021-8979\/2005\/98\u000212\u0001\/123506\/6\/$22.50 98, 12350\nDownloaded 11 May 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

More recently,8 it was reported that very fine\n\u00013\u20135 nm\u0002 nanocrystalline \u0001-FeSi2 films also exhibit a direct\nband gap behavior. As their structure is somewhere at the\nboundary between a fully grown crystalline and the amor-\nphous FeSi2 phase, the measured Eg=0.85\u20130.95 eV con-\nfirms similar band gap values for these two phases. Evi-\ndently, amorphous layers can be deposited on any surface,\nand hence there is a promising potential for applications of\niron disilicide in large area electronics and for fabrication of\nsolar cells.\nVarious growth methods and the properties of crystalline\n\u0001 films were studied extensively, but there is little evidence\non the studies of amorphous iron disilicide. There are earlier\nreports9,10 on the studies of electrical conductivity of these\nfilms, but their optoelectronic properties were not consid-\nered. There is also a report11 on photoelectron spectroscopy\nof these films, and more recently,12 their vibrational density\nof states were studied and compared to those of crystalline \u0001\n7layers.

Stoichiometric FeSi2 films were\ngrown on \u0001100\u0002 Si substrates by co-sputtering of Fe and Si.\nThe obtained results suggest that the growth of as-deposited\nlayers is controlled by surface diffusion, the layers growing\nin an amorphous form for the substrate temperature ranging\nfrom ambient \u0001RT\u0002 to 200 \u00b0C. On the other hand, crystalli-\nzation of initially amorphous layers is controlled by bulk\ndiffusion, and they retain an amorphous structure up to\n400 \u00b0C. The results are discussed in the framework of the\nexisting models and compared to those found in the litera-\nture. They show a possibility to control the layer structure,\nand suggest a temperature interval that can be used for pro-\ncessing and modification of amorphous FeSi2 films.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nIron disilicide films were prepared in a vacuum chamber\ndesigned for ion-beam-assisted deposition \u0001IBAD\u0002, having a\nbase pressure in the 10\u22127 mbar range. The system is\nequipped with two low-energy Ar ion guns, one for sputter-\ning the target material and the other for irradiating the sub-\nstrate during deposition. The substrate holder has a\nthermocouple-controlled heating stage of up to 900 \u00b0C. We\nhave used a target composed of Fe and Si plates, arranged to\ngive the FeSi2 stoichiometry of the deposit. For these experi-\nments we only used one ion gun for sputtering, while the\nother gun was used just for cleaning the substrates before\ndeposition. The substrates used were \u0001100\u0002 Si wafers, pre-\npared by a standard dip in an HF solution and in deionized\nwater before mounting in the chamber. The FeSi2 layers were\ndeposited at a rate of 0.07 nm\/s, to a thickness of\n300\u2013400 nm. The substrate temperature was varied from RT\nto 700 \u00b0C, in steps of 100 \u00b0C. A more detailed description of\nthe IBAD system is given elsewhere.13\nPostdeposition heat treatment of the samples deposited\nat RT was performed by rapid thermal annealing, in a nitro-\ngen ambient, for 30 min at temperatures ranging from\n300 to 700 \u00b0C, in steps of 100 \u00b0C. Stoichiometry of the lay-\ners and uniformity of Fe and Si depth profiles were analyzed\nby Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy \u0001RBS\u0002, using a\n1.5 MeV He+ ion beam. Structural analysis was done by\ntransmission electron microscopy \u0001TEM\u0002, using Philips EM\n400 T and CM 200 microscopes, operated at 120 and\n200 keV, respectively. We have performed cross-sectional\nTEM analysis \u0001XTEM\u0002, and selected area diffraction and mi-\ncrodiffraction \u0001MD\u0002 analysis to identify the phases. We also\ncarried out energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy \u0001EDX\u0002 with\na nanobeam probe to verify the layer composition and\nuniformity.\nDownloaded 11 May 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject tIII. RESULTS\nThe results of XTEM analysis revealed that the FeSi2\nfilms deposited at RT, 100 \u00b0C, and 200 \u00b0C have an amor-\nphous structure. The same is true for samples deposited at\nRT and subsequently annealed at 300 and 400 \u00b0C. A typical\nanalysis that demonstrates this structure is illustrated in Fig.\n1. It shows a bright-field XTEM image and the correspond-\ning MD pattern of an amorphous FeSi2 layer annealed at\n400 \u00b0C. The image was taken near the \u0003110\u0004 Si zone axis. It\nshows a featureless structure of the layer, with a smooth\nsurface and a sharp interface towards the Si substrate. No\nindication of the presence of nanocrystals could be seen for\ndifferent sample tilts in diffraction-contrast imaging. The\nMD pattern taken from the FeSi2 layer shows a typical hal-\nlow ring of an amorphous structure. Analysis of other amor-\nphous samples gave similar results.\nFor substrate temperatures ranging from 300 to 700 \u00b0C,\nthe as-deposited films grow in the form of a polycrystalline\n\u0001-FeSi2 phase. Figure 2 presents a bright-field XTEM image\nof a layer deposited at 300 \u00b0C and a dark-field image of a\nlayer deposited at 500 \u00b0C. It is seen that the layers grow in a\ncolumnar structure, with individual crystal grains stretching\nfrom the Si substrate to the surface. Lateral dimensions of\nthe grains increase from 30 to 50 nm for the deposition tem-\nperature of 300 \u00b0C up to above 100 nm for the higher depo-\nsition temperature. A detailed electron diffraction analysis\nhas identified these grains as \u0001-FeSi2 crystals. The MD pat-\nterns presented in the figure were taken from a single grain in\neach case. The \u0003011\u0004 \u0001-FeSi2 orientation in \u0001a\u0002 was found\nclose to \u0003110\u0004 Si zone axis, where we also found \u000311\u00af2\u0004 ori-\nented \u0001 grains.

As seen from the bright-field XTEM image\ntaken from the sample annealed at 500 \u00b0C, the layers crys-\ntallize in form of relatively large grains of up to a few hun-\ndred nm with a random orientation, practically not influenced\nby the Si substrate. The enclosed MD pattern shows a \u0003001\u0004\norientation of a \u0001-FeSi2 grain, which was found far away\nfrom any low-index Si planes. These relatively large grains\nhave irregularly shaped grain boundaries, some of them con-\ntaining \u0001-FeSi2 nanocrystals. Some of the large grains also\ncontain \u0001-FeSi2 nanocrystals, as seen in the dark-field image\ntaken from a sample annealed at 600 \u00b0C. Nanocrystals ap-\npear as bright features in the image and give a sharp diffrac-\ntion ring in the MD pattern taken from this area. The pattern\nwas taken off a main crystal zone axis, as the contrast of the\nring is rather weak. The position of the ring coincides with\nthe strong \u0001400\u0002 reflection from a larger \u0001-FeSi2 grain.\nThe effect of increasing the substrate temperature to\n700 \u00b0C is illustrated in Fig. 4, showing bright-field XTEM\nimages of an as-deposited and an annealed sample, both\ntaken near \u0003110\u0004 Si. The as-deposited layer grows in the form\nof much larger \u0001-FeSi2 grains compared to the lower depo-\nsition temperatures, resulting in a pronounced surface topog-\nraphy. The growth is still strongly influenced by the sub-\nstrate, although the grains are more relaxed and oriented\n4\u00b0\u20135\u00b0 off \u0003110\u0004 Si. The annealed layer crystallizes also in\nform of large \u0001-FeSi2 grains, but again their crystallographic\norientation is not influenced by the substrate. The surface of\nthe layer remains smooth, although larger grains still contain\nnanocrystals of the same phase. A partial lift off from the\nsubstrate can be seen at the grain boundary, suggesting that\ninternal stress builds up in the layer during crystallization.\nRBS analysis has shown uniform Fe and Si depth pro-\nfiles in all as-deposited and annealed samples, with a con-\ncentration ratio within 1\u20132 at. % of FeSi2 stoichiometry.

In the particular case presented in\nFig. 6\u0001b\u0002, the deduced Fe:Si composition was \u000532:68.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe results of TEM analysis suggest that the growth and\ncrystallization in as-deposited FeSi2 layers is controlled by\nsurface diffusion. For the substrate temperature from RT to\n200 \u00b0C, the adsorbed atomic species have insufficient mobil-\nity for crystallization. At 300 \u00b0C and higher temperatures,\ntheir mobility enables them to diffuse at the substrate surface\nand form a crystalline structure. As the atomic ratio of de-\nposited species satisfies the FeSi2 stoichiometry, the crystal-\nline phase that forms is the low-temperature \u0001-FeSi2. This\nphase is known to be stoichiometric, with an allowed\n1\u20132 at. % of Fe or Si vacancies, while the high-temperature\n\u0003 and the metastable \u0004 phases generally have a much higher\nconcentration of vacancies. There are close epitaxial relation-\nships between \u0001-FeSi2 and crystalline Si, as discussed, for\nexample, in Ref. 14. Hence, the as-deposited layers grow in\nthe form of smaller or larger epitaxial grains, depending on\nthe substrate temperature. Higher temperatures yield larger\nand more relaxed grains, allowing for their slight rotation\ndue to a lattice mismatch with Si. Columnar structure sug-\ngests a layer by layer growth, when initially nucleated grains\nact as seeds for homoepitaxy. In the films deposited at\n700 \u00b0C the adsorbed atoms have a sufficient mobility to fol-\nlow the structure of large underlaying grains, resulting in a\ndeveloped surface morphology.\nAn effective surface diffusion distance x\u00af of adsorbed\natomic species in physical vapor deposition can be deduced\n15,16\nFIG. 6.

J. Appl. Phys. 98, 123506 \u00022005\u0001can be compared to our results. In our case crystallization at\n300 \u00b0C may be due mainly to dominant mobility of Si at-\noms, while the growth of larger and more relaxed grains at\n500\u2013700 \u00b0C probably results from an overall mobility of\nboth Si and Fe.\nIn case of the films that were deposited in an amorphous\nform, crystallization is controlled by bulk diffusion. Here,\nthe diffusion coefficient can be approximated by17,20\nDb \u0007 5\u0002 10\u22125 exp\b\u2212 20TmT \t . \u00013\u0002\nAn estimate of the mean diffusion length l\u00af can be obtained\nfrom the well known form:\nl\u02dc = \u00066Dbt , \u00014\u0002\nwhere t is the annealing time. The calculated values of l\u00af,\ngiven in Table II, again show a very good agreement with\nour experimental results. In earlier studies of amorphous\nFeSi2 films deposited on glass and sapphire substrates, it was\nsuggested that crystallization occurs at 400\u2013450 \u00b0C, al-\nthough for a longer period of annealing10 or for the annealing\nduration not defined,9 and a microanalysis of fully crystal-\nlized layers at these temperatures was not presented. Our\nanalysis shows that FeSi2 films retain an amorphous structure\nafter annealing for 30 min at 400 \u00b0C, while at 500 \u00b0C they\nfully transform to crystalline \u0001-FeSi2 phase. Having the\nFeSi2 stoichiometry, the atomic species do not need to dif-\nfuse long distances, and perhaps only an enhanced mobility\nof Si atoms is sufficient for a complete crystallization. The\nresulting structure is different from that of the as-deposited\ncrystalline layers, or from the structures that are generally\nobtained in solid phase epitaxy or reactive deposition epi-\ntaxy, when silicon is supplied from the substrate. Crystalli-\nzation from an amorphous FeSi2 phase proceeds randomly\nand practically with no influence from the Si substrate. In\nthis random process nanocrystals of the same phase nucleate\nindependently and remain incorporated in larger grains or at\ngrain boundaries. Their presence is reduced with increasing\nthe annealing temperature, but also a tensile stress builds up\nin the layers due to a different thermal expansion coefficient\nTABLE II.

Redistribution subject tIn our earlier report6 we have presented thermodynamic\ncalculations of the amorphous FeSi2 phase equilibrium with\nSi, using a recently developed model.21 An amorphous struc-\nture can be synthesized in form of a \u201cfrozen liquid,\u201d which\ncan be relaxed into more stable structures when energy is\nadded to activate the system. In the latter case a form of\natomic ordering is established in the structure, when the\nnumber of dangling bonds is reduced. Recently, it was\nreported22,23 that a medium range order can be introduced in\namorphous silicon by thermal treatments or by ion irradia-\ntion. In our previous studies we have shown that optical ab-\nsorption of amorphous FeSi2 layers increases when they are\ndeposited at a higher temperature, or after ion irradiation.7\nThis behavior was assigned to establishing a higher degree of\nshort to medium range order within the amorphous structure.\nIn the present study we define a temperature interval that can\nbe used for physical vapor deposition or for thermal process-\ning of amorphous FeSi2 layers. In both cases an added en-\nergy can induce a more ordered and relaxed amorphous\nstructure, which can have an effect on electronic properties\nof the material. Optical absorption studies as a function of\nannealing temperature will be presented in a following\npublication.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have studied the growth and stability of co-sputtered\namorphous FeSi2 films and their transformation to a crystal-\nline phase as a function of the deposition or annealing tem-\nperature. The as-deposited films grow in an amorphous form\nfor the substrate temperature ranging from RT to 200 \u00b0C.\nAfter a postdeposition thermal treatment for 30 min the\namorphous structure remains stable up to 400 \u00b0C.\nFor the substrate temperature ranging from\n300\u2013700 \u00b0C, the as-deposited films grow in form of a crys-\ntalline \u0001-FeSi2 phase. The growth is controlled by surface\ndiffusion, strongly influenced by the Si substrate, and result-\ning in a columnar structure of the films. In a postdeposition\nannealing of initially amorphous films crystallization is con-\ntrolled by bulk diffusion. The layers transform fully to a\ncrystalline \u0001-FeSi2 phase at 500\u2013700 \u00b0C, in a random pro-\ncess not influenced by the Si substrate. The resulting struc-\nture consists of randomly oriented crystal grains, containing\nnanocrystals of the same phase.\nThe results of this work contribute to a better under-\nstanding of the basic processes involved in the growth and\ncrystallization of co-deposited FeSi2 films, and indicate a\ntemperature interval when the amorphous phase is stable.\nThey can be useful in modification of the amorphous struc-\nture towards achieving a higher degree of short to medium\nrange order, and in various processing procedures in a poten-\ntial application of this material.\n1M.
