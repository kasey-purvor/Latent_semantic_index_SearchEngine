It is now well estab-\nlished that nonradiative recombination crucially influences\nthe performance of InP-based lasers.3 The main mechanism\nof nonradiative recombination is Auger recombination\n~AR!.1 Recent experimental analysis estimates that AR con-\ntributes 30%\u201350% of the total threshold current both in\nGaInNAs and in InP-based 1.3 mm devices at room\ntemperature.4,5 AR is then the main cause of the rapid in-\ncrease in threshold current at room temperature and above.\nThe aim of this letter is to study theoretically the AR rate\nand its temperature dependence in GaInNAs quantum wells\n~QWs!. We consider the most likely AR paths, and identify\nhole excitation as the dominant AR process. We show that\nthe Auger recombination coefficient has a relatively weak\n~nearly linear! temperature dependence in the QW consid-\nered, but conclude that AR will dominate the high-\ntemperature threshold characteristics of ideal GaInNAs\nlasers.\nAlthough AR rates have been calculated previously by\nmany authors,6\u201315 the results presented here are the most\nadvanced to date for lasers operating in the telecomm ~1.3\u2013\n1.5 mm! waveband. In narrow-gap materials, the spin-orbit\nsplitting is larger than the band gap and therefore the mecha-\nnism of Auger recombination in such materials is different\nfrom that in the 1.3 mm structure.5 Considerable progress has\nbeen made in the development of accurate Auger calcula-\ntions for narrow-gap materials;6\u201311 by contrast, a variety of\nsevere assumptions and approximations have been made in\nprevious calculations of the AR rate for 1.3\u20131.5 mm QW\nstructures. For example, in Ref. 12, the spin\u2013orbit interaction\nwas neglected and only the CHCC process was considered\n~see Fig. 1!. A linear approximation was used for the\nelectron-hole overlap integral in Ref. 13; the effect of QW\nstrain was omitted in Refs. 12 and 14; and the effect of\nlight-heavy hole mixing was neglected in Ref. 14; while a\nsimple effective-mass approximation was used to calculate\nthe overlap integrals in Ref. 15. All of these approximations\ncan lead to errors of up to one order of magnitude in the\ncalculated AR rate, and they also obscure trends in the de-\npendence of AR rate on temperature and structure param-\neters.\nFor our calculations we consider a 64 \u00c5\nGa0.64In0.36N0.017As0.983 \/GaAs QW structure, similar to that\nused as the active region of a 1.3 mm laser whose experi-\nmental characteristics have recently been studied in detail.5\nThe conventional eight-band k\"p Hamiltonian must be ex-\ntended to a ten-band model16 to describe the band structure\nof GaInNAs, adding two ~spin-degenerate! nitrogen-related\nbands to the usual two conduction and six valence band\nBloch functions.17 The 10310 k\"p model has been success-\nfully used to describe the energy spectra and optical transi-\ntions in GaInNAs QWs,18 and to describe the gain spectra as\na function of carrier density in 1.3 mm laser structures.19\nCalculation of the Auger rates requires several stages: first,\ndetermination of the QW band structure and wave functions,\nincluding highly excited states; then evaluation of the over-\nlap integrals and Coulomb matrix elements; and finally the\nsummation over all initial and final carrier states for the dif-\nFIG. 1.

Auger processes are commonly\nclassified by labeling the initial and final states with letters\ndescribing whether the carriers are in the conduction (C),\nheavy-hole (H), or spin-split-off (S) bands. Figure 1 shows\nthe band diagram corresponding to the two major Auger pro-\nceses, CHCC and CHHS. In quantum wells, heavy- and\nlight-hole states are mixed at nonzero in-plane momentum;\ntherefore \u2018\u2018H\u2019\u2019 stands both for light and heavy holes in the\nAuger process classification. In addition, the excited state in\na QW structure may be either bound ~a confined QW state\nwith large in-plane momentum! or unbound. In the GaInNAs\nstructure studied here, the Auger process with electron exci-\ntation to a bound state turns out to be negligible ~partly due\nto the presence of the nitrogen band!; the excitation of a hole\nto a bound state is also not important, due to the large in-\nplane momentum required. Auger processes involving\nphonons are generally not important for the relatively high\n(T.250 K) temperatures considered here. As a result only\nthe two Auger processes depicted in Fig. 1 are significant in\nthe GaInNAs QW studied. In both these processes the final\nstate for the excited carrier is unbound.\nThe calculated energy spectra of carriers localized in the\ngiven GaInNAs QW structure can be found in Refs. 5 and\n20. For the excited carrier states we note that above-barrier\nreflection at the QW boundaries must be taken into account\n~i.e., the wave function of the excited state is not just a plane\nwave, see below!.\nThe Coulomb matrix element M for the Auger recombi-\nnation process in the QW is M5M I2M II ; with M I given\nby8,9\nM I5E dq~2p! I13~q !I24~2q !@q21~k1i2k3i!2#k~q ,v! , ~1!\nwhere Iab(q)5*Ca*(x ,kai)Cb(x ,kbi)eiqxdx is the overlap\nintegral between the states with indices a and b ~equal to 1,\n2, 3, and 4 denoting the states of the four carriers involved in\nthe Auger process!; the x axis is directed along the QW\ngrowth direction; k(q ,v) is the dielectric function deter-\nmined using the Lindhard formula,21 q is the momentum\ntransferred, and \\v the energy transferred during the Auger\nprocess; kii is the in-plane momentum of the ith state. M II is\nobtained from M I by formal 3\u21944 substitution. It is impor-\ntant to calculate the overlap integral using the wave functions\ndetermined from the multiband model; the product CaCb in\nthe above expression for the overlap integral involves the\nscalar product of two vectors ~in the basis of the ten Bloch\nfunctions!. This scalar product strongly depends on the in-\nplane momentum of the particles.\nIt follows from Eq. ~1! that the Auger matrix elements\nare determined from two overlap integrals: an electron-hole\noverlap integral between two states localized in the QW and\nan overlap integral between a localized state and a highly\nexcited unbound state. We describe briefly the main charac-\nteristics of these two important quantities. The solid line in\nFig. 2 shows the dependence of the electron-hole overlap\nintegral Ieh on the momentum transferred. The dependence\nIeh(q) is nonlinear, so that the previously used linear\napproximation13 for Ieh(q) is generally not valid for QW\nstructures. It follows from an analysis of Eq. ~1! that the\nmatrix element consists mainly of two contributions:8,9 a\ncontribution from an area where \u2018\u2018small\u2019\u2019 values of momen-\ntum are transferred, q;ukei2khiu,p\/a (a is the QW\nwidth!; and a contribution where \u2018\u2018large\u2019\u2019 values of momen-\ntum are transferred, q;kg , where kg satisfies the equation\n\\2kg\n2\/(2mc)5Eg (Eg is the effective band gap, mc is the\neffective electron mass!. In practice the existence of these\ntwo contributions means that the whole range of q values is\nimportant in Eq. ~1!, from very small values ~where Ieh var-\nies linearly with q) to relatively large values of q ~where the\nlinear approximation used in Ref. 14 is in error by more than\none order of magnitude!. The value of the Ieh overlap inte-\ngral is also strongly influenced by the light-heavy hole mix-\nture at nonzero in-plane momentum. It should be noted that\nthe electron-hole overlap integral is dependent on various\nQW parameters, including the quantum well width and\ndepth, the strain, and the effective band gap; this can give a\nstrong dependence of the Auger rate on these structure\nparameters.11 To study the influence of the N band on the\nelectron-hole overlap integral we also considered an artificial\nN-free InGaAs-like QW structure with the same effective\nband gap and band offsets ~details of this structure are given\nin Ref. 20!. The overlap integral for this artificial structure is\nshown by the dashed line in Fig. 2. The interaction with the\nN band reduces the conduction band (s like! component of\nthe electron wave function, while the hole states are largely\nunaffected by the presence of the N band. The change in the\nelectron wave function leads to a small reduction in the over-\nlap integral at a given q value compared to the N-free struc-\nture. Thus, the presence of nitrogen leads to a decrease in\nIeh ; this decrease is larger for larger N content xN ~if the\nband gap and other structure parameters are kept un-\nchanged!. The Auger matrix element depends also on the\noverlap integral Iex between the localized and excited ~elec-\ntron or hole! states. From a mathematical point of view, this\nis an integral between the \u2018\u2018smooth\u2019\u2019 wave function of a car-\nrier localized in the QW ~with wave vector k;p\/a) and the\nhighly oscillating wave function of an excited carrier ~with\nwave vector k;kg). As a consequence, the overlap integral\nIex is usually small compared to Ieh . Deviation of the ex-\ncited state wave function from a simple plane wave also\nsignificantly influences the value of Iex .\nFIG. 2.

The curves are\nfor the case when khi50 and kei is varied; the case when khi is varied and\nkei is fixed give a very similar variation of Ieh(q).

Mathemati-\ncally this requires the calculation of a five-dimensional inte-\ngral over the carrier momentum components and a summa-\ntion over the electron and hole QW levels ~these final\nintegrals were calculated numerically!. Figure 3 shows the\ncalculated AR coefficient C as a function of temperature.\nThe value of C calculated is about 5% smaller than the value\nwe obtain for the equivalent artificial N-free structure. We\ndefine this coefficient as C5G\/n3, where G is the Auger\nrate calculated for a carrier density of n5p51012 cm22.\nThe Auger coefficient ~and its temperature dependence deter-\nmined in this way! does depend on the carrier density; the\ncalculated AR rate has a slightly subcubic dependence on\ncarrier density. It follows from Fig. 3 that the main AR path\nis via the CHHS recombination process. This result agrees\nwith a previous experimental and theoretical analysis, which\nconcluded that the CHHS process dominates in InGaAs~P!-\nbased devices.22 The calculated AR coefficient depends\nweakly on temperature, because Auger recombination is a\nthresholdless process in QW heterostructures, due to the lack\nof momentum conservation along the QW growth direc-\ntion.8,12,23 Previous experimental measurements also con-\nfirmed a weak temperature dependence of the Auger coeffi-\ncient in an InGaAsP-based QW structure.24 The temperature\ndependence of the Auger contribution JA to the total laser\nthreshold current is then dominated by the variation of the\nthreshold carrier density with temperature, n th(T). Combin-\ning the AR results presented in this letter with a detailed\ncalculation of n th(T),25 we find very good agreement be-\ntween the calculated values of JA(T) and the experimentally\ndetermined values.5 For example at T5300 K the calculated\nJA5205 A\/cm2, and the experimental value JA(exper)\n5177 A\/cm2; at T5360 K the calculated JA51045 A\/cm2\nand the experimental JA\n(exper)51076 A\/cm2.\nIn summary, we have studied theoretically the role of\nAuger recombination in a GaInNAs\/GaAs strained QW. We\nfound CHHS recombination to be the dominant Auger re-\ncombination path, involving hole excitation to an unbound\nstate in the spin-split-off band. The calculated AR coefficient\nin GaInNAs QWs is of the same order of magnitude as in\nnitrogen-free structures with similar parameters ~same effec-\ntive band gap and band offsets!. The introduction of nitrogen\ndecreases the electron-hole overlap integral, but also leads to\nan increased conduction band density of states; the combina-\ntion of these two factors results in an approximately un-\nchanged AR coefficient, C . We conclude that Auger recom-\nbination plays an important role at room temperature and\nabove in GaInNAs 1.3 mm QW laser structures, putting an\nintrinsic limit on the temperature stability of the threshold\ncharacteristics. The AR rate is sensitive to the variation of\nQW structure parameters ~e.g., strain, effective barrier height\nand band gap!, so further investigations would be valuable to\nidentify optimized device structures. Overall, our results con-\nfirm that the intrinsic gain and loss characteristics of GaIn-\nNAs make this material very attractive for vertical cavity\nlasers and other integrated GaAs-based devices.\nThis work was supported by Science Foundation Ireland.\n1 M.
