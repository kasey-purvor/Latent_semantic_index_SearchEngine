The high mass accuracy and low background\nnoise of the ECD mass spectra allow facile sequencing of\ncoeluting isobaric phosphopeptides, with up to two iso-\nbaric phosphopeptides sequenced from a single mass\nspectrum. In contrast to the previously described neutral\nloss dependent ECD method, targeted ECD allows analy-\nsis of both phosphotyrosine peptides and lower abun-\ndance phosphopeptides. The approach was applied to\nphosphorylation analysis of human Sprouty2, a regulator\nof receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Fifteen sites of\nphosphorylation were identified, 11 of which are novel.\nPhosphorylation is a widespread and biologically significant\nprotein post-translational modification.1 Phosphopeptide discovery\nis becoming more routine, thanks largely to improved enrichment\nmethods and higher speed mass spectrometers.2,3 However site\nlocalization from collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectra\nremains a challenge, particularly for larger phosphopeptides with\nmultiple potential phosphorylation sites.4 Low-energy CID frag-\nmentation of phosphopeptides frequently results in losses of\nphosphoric acid, in addition to the typical CID losses of water\nand ammonia, thus complicating manual analysis.5-7 Bioinformatic\napproaches to automation of site localization have recently been\npublished.8,9 While automation streamlines the localization pro-\ncess, many CID spectra still give ambiguous results, e.g., 39 and\n33% of sites in two recent large-scale studies where confidence of\nsite localization was quantified.8,10 Site-directed mutagenesis is\ncommonly used in order to decipher the functional significance\nof phosphorylation for a given protein.11 If site-directed mutagen-\nesis is to be carried out, obtaining accurate localization data for\nas many sites of phosphorylation as possible is particularly\nimportant, in order to avoid lengthy and costly analysis of\ninappropriate residues.\nAlternative mass spectrometric methods for site localization\ninclude MS3 of the H3PO4 neutral loss product ion, negative mode\nCID, and non-CID radical-driven fragmentation. Neutral loss\ndependent MS3 spectra have been used to increase confidence\nin phosphopeptide identifications;9,12-14 however, their contribu-\ntion to site localization has not been rigorously described. Jiang\net al. used information from paired MS2 and MS3 spectra to\nlocalize the site of phosphorylation, but neither the relative\ncontributions to localization from the different scan types nor the\nconfidence of site localization was reported.12 Beausoleil et al.\nfound that MS3 spectra provided little additional localization\ninformation, an observation that was ascribed to reduced ion\nstatistics in MS3 spectra.8 An additional caveat is that the neutral\nloss of water from unmodified residues results in a fragment of\nthe same mass as loss of H3PO4 from a phosphorylated residue.7,15\nThe use of negative ion mode CID to differentiate between clusters\nof potential phosphorylation sites has been described.4 This\nmethod is based on a difference in intensity between two\nfragments, rather than distinct fragments.\nElectron capture dissociation (ECD) and electron-transfer\ndissociation (ETD) are radical-driven fragmentation techniques.16,17\nIn contrast to CID, labile modifications such as phosphorylation\n* To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Work is\nongoing to implement ETD on an instrument with a high-\nresolution mass analyzer.24,25 ECD has the advantage that mass\nspectra are acquired with high resolution and mass accuracy, as\nit is virtually exclusive to Fourier transform ion cyclotron\nresonance mass spectrometry. We have shown previously that\nonline liquid chromatography (LC) ECD can be used in phos-\nphopeptide discovery.26 That method, neutral loss dependent ECD\n(NL ECD), takes advantage of the signature neutral loss of H3PO4\nin order to focus ECD time on phosphopeptides. ECD has the\npotential to give excellent quality mass spectra of phosphopeptides,\nbut it is unlikely to be as efficient as CID for phosphopeptide\ndiscovery, due to the requirement for accumulation of considerably\ngreater amounts of precursor with concomitant increases in scan\ntime.\nIn order to maximize the advantages of ECD, we now present\nan alternative application of ECD for site localization. Phospho-\npeptide discovery is carried out in an initial LC-CID experiment,\nfollowed by targeted LC-ECD of the identified phosphopeptides,\nenabling site localization and confirmation of the phosphopeptide\nidentification. The use of an initial stage of mass spectrometry to\ngenerate an inclusion list for subsequent analysis has been applied\npreviously to the identification of phosphopeptides and other\nsubstoichiometric components of a mixture.27,28 Annan et al.\nemployed negative ion mode precursor ion scanning, followed by\npositive ion mode MS\/MS analysis of the resulting precursor\nions.28 Picotti et al. employed multiple rounds of targeted LC-CID\nMS\/MS in order to identify low-abundance components of a\nprotein digest.27 In our targeted LC-ECD method, ECD analyses\nare not dependent on the presence of a CID neutral loss peak,\nallowing site localization of phosphotyrosine peptides (which do\nnot show a dominant neutral loss). ECD events are restricted to\na known number of phosphopeptides, allowing the ECD time to\nbe extended to improve sequencing of low-abundance phospho-\npeptides: The least abundant phosphopeptide identified had a 200-\nfold lower intensity than the most abundant phosphopeptide. We\napply this strategy to human Sprouty2, an important regulator of\nreceptor tyrosine kinase signaling.29 Sprouty2 has been shown\nto antagonize pathways downstream of fibroblast growth factor\nsignaling.29,30 Tyrosine phosphorylation (at Tyr55) has been\nshown to be essential for this antagonism; however, the mecha-\nnism by which this is accomplished is largely unknown.29,31\nSprouty2 is downregulated in various cancers, suggesting it has\na tumor-suppressor role.32 In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation,\nSprouty2 is known to be phosphorylated on serine and threonine\nresidues.30,33 Alterations in Sprouty2 phosphorylation, observed\nas a shift in SDS PAGE migration, have been implicated in\nSprouty2 activity.33-35 Precise localization of the sites of Sprouty2\nphosphorylation will allow the role of phosphorylation in Sprouty2\nfunction to be assessed further.\nBy use of targeted ECD, we were able to identify 14 sites of\nphosphorylation, 11 of which have not been described previously.\nTaking advantage of the high mass accuracy and low background\nnoise levels of the ECD spectra, we demonstrate that up to two\ncoeluting isobaric phosphopeptides can be assigned from a single\nECD spectrum. ECD has been widely hailed as applicable to the\nanalysis of phosphorylation.20,21,36 While ECD has been applied\nto the identification of known sites of phosphorylation and to the\nidentification of sites of phosphorylation on synthetic pep-\ntides,21,36-38 this work is among the first applications of ECD to\nthe assignment of novel sites of in vivo phosphorylation on a\nbiologically significant signaling protein.39,40\nEXPERIMENTAL METHODS\nPlasmid Constructs.

The mixture was\nthen further incubated for 16 h at 4 \u00b0C. After incubation, beads\nwere washed 5 times with ice-cold lysis buffer (20\u00d7 the bed volume\nof the beads), before being resuspended and boiled for 5 min in\n2\u00d7 SDS PAGE sample buffer (10% glycerol (v\/v), 2% SDS (w\/v),\n0.1% bromophenol blue (w\/v), 200 mM 1, 4-dithiothreitol (DTT),\n100 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8). Samples were then resolved on 4-12%\nprecast NuPAGENovex Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) using NuPAGE-\nMOPS SDS Running Buffer (Invitrogen), and protein bands were\nvisualized by staining with ImperialProtein Coomassie stain\n(Pierce Biotechnology Inc.) for 1 h.\nIn-Gel Digestion and Phosphopeptide Enrichment. Fol-\nlowing Coomassie staining, the Sprouty2 band was excised.\nCysteines were reduced (10 mM DTT) and alkylated (50 mM\niodoacetamide) prior to overnight in-gel trypsin digestion (12.5\nng\/\u00b5L; Trypsin Gold; Promega, Madison, WI) in 25 mM am-\nmonium bicarbonate.\nPhosphopeptides were enriched from the resulting mixture by\nTiO2 affinity chromatography according to Larsen et al.,2 with\nminor modifications. Peptides were loaded onto TiO2 microcol-\numns in 2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Columns were washed with\n100 mg\/mL 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), 80% MeCN, 2%\nTFA, then with the same buffer omitting DHB. Peptides were\neluted in a two-step procedure with 50 mM Na2HPO4 followed by\ndilute NH4OH solution. Eluates were desalted using C18 ZipTips,\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Millipore). The\nresulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by liquid chromatog-\nraphy tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS).\nLiquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry.\nOnline liquid chromatography was performed by use of a Micro\nAS autosampler and Surveyor MS pump (Thermo Electron,\nBremen, Germany). Peptides were loaded onto a 75-\u00b5m (internal\ndiameter) Integrafrit (New Objective, USA) C842 resolving column\n(length 10 cm) and separated over a 40-min gradient from 0 to\n40% acetonitrile (Baker, Holland). Peptides eluted directly (\u223c350\nnL\/min) via a Triversa nanospray source (Advion Biosciences,\nNY) into a 7-T LTQ FT mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron),\nwhere they were subjected either to data-dependent CID or to\ntargeted ECD.\nData-Dependent Collision-Induced Dissociation. The mass\nspectrometer alternated between a full FT-MS scan (m\/z 395-1600)\nand subsequent CID MS\/MS scans of the five most abundant\nions. In the CID analysis of the phosphopeptide-enriched sample,\nif a neutral loss of 98 Da (49 or 32.67 m\/z) from the precursor\nion was observed in the five most abundant ions in the CID mass\nspectrum, an MS\/MS\/MS scan of the neutral loss ion was also\nacquired. Survey scans were acquired in the ICR cell with a\nresolution of 100 000 at m\/z 400. Precursor ions were isolated\nand subjected to CID in the linear ion trap. The width of the\nprecursor isolation window was 3 m\/z. Only multiply charged\nprecursor ions were selected for MS\/MS. CID was performed\nwith helium gas at a collision energy normalized to precursorm\/z\nof 35%.43 Activation q was 0.25. Precursor ions were activated for\n30 ms.

(parameters: no scan\ngrouping; minimum ion threshold of 15; absolute intensity\nthreshold of 50). The DTA files were searched against the\nSwissprot database (version 54.4; 287 050 entries) using the\nMascot algorithm (Mascot version 2.2.03; http:\/\/www.matrix-\nscience.com\/; Matrix Sciences, UK). The search parameters\nused were as follows: human; fully tryptic (cleavage N-terminal\nto proline allowed); three missed cleavages allowed; carbami-\ndomethylation as fixed modification; oxidation (M), deamidation\n(NQ), and phosphorylation (STY) as variable modifications;\nprecursor accuracy of 50 ppm; fragment accuracy of 0.5 Da;\ninstrument type ESI-Trap. The taxonomy filter resulted in 17\n565 protein sequences being considered in the database search.\nAccepted identifications scored within the significance thresh-\nold (p > 0.05), except where noted (see Table 1), and had less\nthan 10 ppm mass error. All CID identifications were confirmed\nby subsequent ECD data. Phosphorylation site localization from\nCID mass spectra was assessed using the A-score algorithm\n(http:\/\/ascore.med.harvard.edu\/),8 with manual validation.\nTargeted Electron Capture Dissociation. The mass spec-\ntrometer acquired full FT-MS scans (m\/z 395-1600) until the\nappearance of ions on an inclusion list triggered sequential CID\nand ECD MS\/MS scans. Precursor ions were isolated in the ion\ntrap and transferred to the ICR cell for ECD. Isolation width was\n6 m\/z. Automated gain control was used to accumulate sufficient\nprecursor ions (target value 1e6, maximum fill time 1 s). The\nelectrons for ECD were produced by an indirectly heated barium\ntungsten cylindrical dispenser cathode (5.1-mm diameter, 154 mm\nfrom the cell, 1 mm off-axis). The current across the electrode\nwas \u223c1.1 A. Ions were irradiated for 60 ms at 5% energy\n(corresponding to a cathode potential of -2.775 V). Each ECD\nscan comprised either 8 or 24 coadded microscans, acquired with\na resolution of 25 000 at m\/z 400. Precursor ions for ECD\nfragmentation with 8 microscans were selected from an inclusion\nlist containing the following m\/z values: 423.22, 512.87, 530.74,\n585.96, 639.33, 640.83, 666.32, 704.12, 817.39, 817.88, 828.87,\n854.11, 878.44, 958.49. Precursors for fragmentation with 24\nmicroscans were as above, with the omission of 423.22, 817.39,\nand 817.88, in order to focus on the Tyr55 phosphopeptide. The\ntolerance window for these parent ions was set at \u00b10.05 m\/z.\nDynamic exclusion was used with a repeat count of two and an\nexclusion duration of 30 s. ECD data were manually assigned,\nbased on the known peptide sequences from the initial CID\nidentifications.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nHuman embryonic kidney cells were transfected with epitope-\ntagged human Sprouty2. After immunoprecipitation and SDS\nPAGE, the band corresponding to Sprouty2 was excised and\nsubjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. The resulting peptide mixture\nwas analyzed by standard LC-CIDMS\/MS, either directly or after\nphosphopeptide enrichment.2 The phosphopeptides identified\nfrom these initial experiments are shown in Table 1. We have\napplied the recently developed Ascore tool to assist in phospho-\npeptide localization from CID mass spectra.8 The Ascore algorithm\nis designed to automate the time-consuming process of manual\nsite localization and to give a probabilistic score of the confidence\nin the localization. The Ascore is extremely useful, but we would\nurge caution in accepting all localized sites (scores >20) without\nmanual analysis of the key differentiating fragment peaks, as ion\ntrap spectra have a reasonable level of background noise, which\nmay contribute to the localization score.

ECD mass spectra\ncomprise 24 coadded microscans.\n6654 Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 80, No. 17, September 1, 2008\nMS3 spectra were also acquired in the CID experiment after\nphosphopeptide enrichment. MS3 spectra for four of the seven\nphosphopeptides in Table 1 were obtained (data not shown);\nhowever, interpretation of these spectra was complicated by the\npotential for neutral loss of water from unmodified amino acids.\nMS3 spectra were not used for phosphorylation site localization\nin this work.\nFifteen proteins were identified from the Sprouty2 gel band,\nin addition to Sprouty2, in the LC-CID MS\/MS analysis without\nphosphopeptide enrichment (data not shown). Coelution of pep-\ntides similar in mass was observed in this experiment. Phospho-\npeptide enrichment reduced the sample complexity, allowing clean\nisolation of precursor ions. The enrichment step is particularly\nimportant for the ECD analysis (see below) as a larger isolation\nwindow (6 vs 3 m\/z) is used to ensure sufficient ions are\ntransferred to the ICR cell. In the ideal case of a completely\npurified small phosphoprotein, targeted site localization could be\ncarried out without phosphopeptide enrichment. In practice, partial\npurification with additional phosphopeptide enrichment will often\nbe the more straightforward option.\nThe phosphopeptides identified contain a total of 22 potential\nsites of phosphorylation. Putative site localization is shown in Table\n1; however, for three out of seven peptides, the CID-based\nlocalization is ambiguous. The phosphopeptide containing Tyr55\nis of particular interest, as phosphorylation of Tyr55 has been\nshown to be critical for Sprouty2 function.29 It should be noted\nthat the Tyr55-containing peptide in Table 1 is nontryptic, with\ncleavage occurring between arginine and proline.44 A longer\nversion of this peptide was identified in the analysis without\nenrichment, suggesting the acidic conditions of the phosphopep-\ntide enrichment procedure may cause this fragmentation.45 The\nCID mass spectrum of the Tyr55-containing peptide shows a\ndominant neutral loss of H3PO4, suggesting that the phosphory-\nlation is on a threonine (Thr52 or Thr56) rather than Tyr55\n(Figure 1). Unambiguous localization of the site of phosphorylation\nwas not possible. Examination of the extracted ion chromatogram\nsuggested that two versions of the peptide were present (Figure\n1a); however, only the later eluting of these was selected for CID\nfragmentation.\nIn order to further examine the Tyr55-containing phospho-\npeptide and to confirm the localization of the other identified sites\nof phosphorylation, a targeted ECD analysis was carried out. The\nimmunoprecipitation and phosphopeptide enrichment was re-\npeated, and an inclusion list of the identified phosphopeptides\n(shown in Table 1) was used to restrict ECD events to the\nprecursors of interest. Two targeted ECD analyses were carried\nout: one with 8 microscans per ECD spectrum and one with 24.\nThe longer ECD events gave higher quality spectra for some low-\nabundance phosphopeptides, but results from both analyses were\nin agreement. In these analyses, both the earlier- and later-eluting\nTyr55-containing phosphopeptide peaks were fragmented (Figure\n2). The two mass spectra clearly show that the first-eluting peak\ncorresponds to phosphotyrosine 55 (Figure 2a) and the second-\neluting peak to phosphothreonine 56 (Figure 2b), a site of\nphosphorylation that has not been described previously. As with\nour previous NL ECD strategy,26 the approach taken here is\ndesigned to maximize the advantages of ECD for phosphopeptide\nidentification, specifically site localization, while minimizing the\ndisadvantage of ECD (relatively long acquisition periods to achieve\ngood-quality mass spectra from low-abundance precursors). In\ncontrast to the NL ECD strategy, the targeted approach allows\n(44) Keil, B. Specificity of Proteolysis; Springer-Verlag: Berlin, Germany, 1992.\n(45) Olsen, J. V.; Ong, S. E.; Mann, M. Mol.

The targeted approach also allows\nlower abundance phosphopeptides to be selected for ECD, by\nomitting more abundant phosphopeptides from the inclusion list.\nIn this experiment, there was a 200-fold difference between the\nintensities of the most abundant phosphopeptide and the least\nabundant (Supporting Information Figure 1). Targeted precursors\ncan be specified with a mass tolerance small enough to make false\npositives unlikely, minimizing the possibility of spending time\nanalyzing a nonphosphorylated peptide. ECD time can therefore\nbe extended to maximize the information content obtained from\nthe targeted phosphopeptides.\nFigure 3 shows ECD mass spectra obtained from [M + 2H]2+\nions of the LLGSSFSSGPVADGIIR phosphopeptide. The three\nmass spectra show that four separate isoforms of this phospho-\npeptide, with four distinct phosphorylation sites, are partially\nresolved by the LC separation. Figure 3b shows the ECD mass\nspectrum obtained at 36.5-min retention time. The fragments\nobserved suggest that two isoforms of the phosphopeptide are\npresent: one containing phosphorylation at Ser141 and one\ncontaining phosphorylation at Ser142. The defining fragment for\nthe Ser141 phosphopeptide is z10\u2022 (denoted with * and enlarged\nin inset). Figure 3c shows the ECD mass spectrum obtained at\nretention time 37.7 min. The fragments observed suggest that the\nmain species is the Ser142 phosphopeptide; however, a very low\nintensity z10 fragment (denoted with *) indicates the additional\npresence of the Ser141 phosphopeptide in low abundance. The\ncomplementary c ions are not observed, as is often the case for\nonline LC-ECD of doubly charged tryptic peptides; however, the\nhigh mass accuracy and low noise level give added confidence to\nthe Ser141 z10 assignment (see Figure 3b and c inset). Figure 3d\nshows the ECD mass spectrum obtained at retention time 38.7\nmin. The fragments observed suggest that two isoforms are\npresent: the Ser138 phosphopeptide and the Ser139 phosphopep-\ntide. The peak at m\/z 1289.65 corresponds to the z13\u2022 fragment\n(denoted *) of the Ser138 phosphopeptide (see Figure 3d inset).\nThe lower abundance of the *z13\u2022 fragment, relative to that of the\nz13\u2022 fragment from the Ser139 phosphopeptide, suggests that the\nSer139 phosphopeptide is the main species present.\nAn important feature of the targeted strategy is that, in cases\nwhere different phosphorylation forms of a peptide approximately\ncoelute (Figure 3), both the earlier- and later-eluting forms are\nsequenced because post-MS\/MS dynamic exclusion is relaxed.\nThis would not be the case if dynamic exclusion were applied\nafter a single MS\/MS event, as in many proteomic experiments.\nWhere isobaric phosphopeptides coelute, composite spectra will\nbe acquired. ECD mass spectra are typically acquired over a\nlonger period than CID spectra. High-quality ECD mass spectra\ncan be obtained in a few seconds; however, the time required is\ndependent on the precursor abundance. Lower abundance precur-\nsors require longer time to reach the target number of ions\n(accumulated in the linear ion trap), prior to the rapid ECD event.\nIn this work, we have used up to 24 microscans, each with a\nmaximum permitted fill time of 1 s, in order to obtain the highest\npossible quality ECD mass spectra from eluting phosphopeptides,\ni.e., performing ECD throughout the elution period of a peptide.\nThese conditions favor the creation of composite spectra. How-\never, interpretation of these spectra is not complicated, given that\nmost of the fragments are identical and that loss of modifications\nfrom backbone fragments is not observed. Interpretation of the\ncorresponding linear ion trap CID mass spectra would be more\ndifficult, due to the potential for neutral losses of H3PO4, H2O,\nand NH3 from fragments and the lower resolution of the mass\nspectra. These difficulties were encountered during manual\nanalysis of CID MS3 spectra, where composite spectra of peptides\nphosphorylated at different sites were not distinguishable from\nneutral loss of H2O from unmodified serine residues.\nFigure 4 shows the ECD mass spectrum obtained from [M +\n2H]2+ ions of the phosphorylated SISTVSSGSR peptide. The\nfragments observed and their relative intensities suggest that this\nis a composite mass spectrum of three SISTVSSGSR phospho-\npeptides. The predominant species is SISTVSpSGSR (pSer116).\nThe peaks observed at m\/z 327.107 and 384.129 correspond to\nthe z2 and z3 fragments of SISTVSSGpSR (pSer118; denoted with\n$). The peak observed at m\/z 391.194 corresponds to the z4\nfragment of SISTVpSSGSR (pSer115; denoted with *). From this\nECD mass spectrum, the sites of phosphorylation can be localized\nto serines 115, 116, and 118. The ease of analysis of composite\nECD spectra is demonstrated in Figure 4, where fragment ion\ncontributions from three phosphopeptides are evident.\nThe complete list of identified phosphopeptides is presented\nin Table 2. A total of 15 Sprouty2 phosphorylation sites have been\nidentified. Targeted ECD has allowed the unambiguous assign-\nment of 14 sites of phosphorylation (see Scheme 1), 11 of which\nare novel. A further phosphorylation site was identified by CID\nonly. Mass spectra showing localization of the remaining sites are\ngiven in the Supporting Information.\nECD fragment ion abundances from large peptides have\npreviously been used to quantify relative amounts of isomeric\nspecies;46 however, this was from a direct infusion experiment.\n(46) Pesavento, J.

Accession number O43597.\n6656 Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 80, No. 17, September 1, 2008\nWhile the mass spectrum shown in Figure 4 suggests that Ser116\nis the major site of phosphorylation, it should be noted that\ncoelution of the isomeric species may not be perfect (e.g., Figure\n3) and that the yield of particular fragment ions in ECD may be\ninfluenced by structural effects.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe have shown that targeted ECD is a powerful technique\nfor localizing sites of phosphorylation. Application of the strategy\nto human Sprouty2 increased the number of phosphorylation sites\nidentified from 7 to 15, as well as providing increased confidence\nin site localization.\nA similar targeted approach could be carried out using ETD\nin an ion trap instrument, as ETD has many of the same\nadvantages as ECD. This would similarly benefit from retention\nof the labile phosphoamino acid intact, but give lower resolution\nspectra.\nIn summary, we have applied online liquid chromatography\ntargeted ECD to the localization of 14 sites of Sprouty2 phospho-\nrylation, 11 of which are novel. Prior to this work, only two novel\nsites of phosphorylation have been identified by ECD.39,40 The\nunambiguous localization of the novel phosphorylation sites\ndescribed here provides a basis for identification of the responsible\nkinases, and the functional significance of, Sprouty2 phosphory-\nlation events. Further quantitative experiments to this end are\nongoing in our laboratory.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors thank Professor Laura Machesky for donation of\nthe gateway mammalian expression vector.
