Navarro, J.R.Alcock and R.W.Whatmore \nNanotechnology Dept, SIMS, Cranfield University, Cranfield, Bedford, MK 43 0AL. \n \nAbstract \nAn aqueous system for tape casting PZT ceramics was developed using poly (vinyl \nalcohol) binder, poly (propylene glycol) plasticizer, D3021 dispersant and Surfynol SE-\nF wetting agent. Screening experiments were performed to assess the stability of the \nsuspension in the presence of the dispersant by performing pH, conductivity and Zeta \npotential measurements. Viscosity measurements were used to find the optimum level \nof dispersant needed to produce a stable slip at pH 10.2. Subsequently, the rheological \nand mechanical characteristics were also investigated. \n \nKeywords: Tape casting, Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT), Suspensions, colloidal \nprocessing. \n \n1 Introduction \nTape casting (1) is mainly used for manufacturing thin, flat ceramic sheets, which can \nbe cut, punched or stacked to produce multilayered structures. Some applications \ninclude transducers, solid oxide fuel cells and pyroelectric infrared detectors. \nTraditionally, tape casting has been done using organic solvents however water-based \n 2\ntape casting is becoming more commonplace because of environmental, health, safety \nand economic reasons. Increased problems of the aqueous route include slower drying, \nincreased stress sensitivity of tapes, increased flocculation and poor wetting of slips due \nto the high surface tension of water and, in the case of barium titanate (2) reactions with \nwater can occur. \n \nThe present work aims to study the colloidal behaviour of aqueous PZT suspensions \ndispersed by an anionic polyelectrolyte. It is important to achieve a well-dispersed \nslurry before the addition of the binder and plasticizer in the slip, which helps to \neliminate defects in the green tape and improve its mechanical performance. In this \npaper the stability of the slurry is studied by rheological measurements and mechanical \nproperties of the green tapes made by tape casting is also investigated. \n \n2 Experimental Procedures \n2.1 Materials \nPZT powders (Pb [{(Mg1\/3Nb2\/3)0.075 (Zr0.925Ti0.075)0.925}0.99 U0.01]O3) with an average \nparticle size of 1 \u00b5m and a specific surface area of 1.209 m2g-1 (BET specific surface \narea) were produced by the mixed oxide route. A polycarboxylate ammonium salt \n(Duramax 3021, MW = 2500, Rohm and Haas, France) was used as the dispersant. \nD3021 dissociates in water to produce negatively charged polyions and ammonium \ncounter ions. The polymers utilised for tape casting slurries was poly (vinyl alcohol) \n(PVA, 87-89 % partial hydrolysis, MW = 110, 000 g mole-1) (Sigma-Aldrich U.K.) \nbinder and a Poly (propylene glycol) (PPG 400, Sigma-Aldrich, U.K.) plasticizer. To \n 3\nimprove the wetting behaviour of the slip during tape casting a Surfynol SE-F (Air \nproducts and Chemicals, Holland) wetting agent was also added to the PZT slip. \n \n2.2 Zeta Potential measurements \nDilute 1 vol.% PZT suspensions containing D3021 and deionised water were prepared \nfor the analysis. The suspension was placed in 100 ml silicate milling jar with 200 g of \ncylindrical yttrium-stabilised zirconia milling media and ball-milled for 18 hours prior \nto the analysis. Acetic acid (1M) and ammonium hydroxide (1M) were used as the \ntitrants to adjust the suspension pH accordingly. Zeta potential measurements were \nperformed using a Malvern Zetasizer 3000. \n \n2.3 Rheological characterisation of slip \nViscosity measurements were at room temperature conducted using a rheometer (Bohlin \nInstruments, Ltd. Cirencester, U.K.). PZT suspensions were prepared at solids loadings \nof 20 and 30 vol.% with different amounts of D3021 for a dispersant optimisation study. \nThe samples were allowed to reach thermal equilibrium before the measurements. The \nviscosity was then measured at a single shear rate of 100 s-1. \n \nThe flow behaviour of the slip listed in Table 1 was assessed by measuring the viscosity \nover the shear rate range of 0.06 s-1 to 150 s-1 in an up and down sweep taking \napproximately 15 minutes. \n \n 4\nTo detect thixotropic behaviour of the slip in Table 1 the shear stress was measured as a \nfunction of increasing shear rate in a loop test with up sweep of 0.06s-1 to 150 s-1 and a \ndown sweep of 150 s-1 to 0.06 s-1 in 15 minutes. \n \n2.4 Tape casting \nPZT slips were prepared for tape casting by ball milling PZT powder, deionised water \nand ammonium polycarboxylate dispersant in 100 ml silicate milling jars with 200 g of \ncylindrical zirconia milling media for approximately 8 hours. Surfynol SE-F wetting \nagent was then added to the slip and ball milled for a further 1hr. Poly (vinyl alcohol) \nwas pre-dissolved in a sufficient amount of water by heating the PVA solution in water \nto 950C for at least 2hrs (3). The dissolved binder solution and poly (ethylene glycol) \nplasticizer were then added to the slip and ball milled, for a further 18 hrs to aid the \ndissolution of the organics into the slurry. The composition of the slip used for tape \ncasting is listed in Table 1. Tape casting was achieved using a laboratory-scale, table top \ntape caster (TTC-1000, Richard E. Mistler Inc. Morrisville, PA) with a stationary \ncasting head using a casting rate of 0.75 cm s-1 and gap height of 550 \u00b5m and \npolypropylene carrier film (Western Wallis, CA). After tape casting, the tapes were left \nto dry at room temperature and relative humidity. \n \n2.5 Tensile testing of green tapes \nThe tensile testing of green tapes was accomplished using an Instron universal testing \nmachine (Model 6025, Instron, England). Tensile measurements were done at room \ntemperature (20 \u00b1 10C) and humidity of 35 \u00b1 5%. Dog bone shape tensile specimens \nwith 7mm width and 90 mm gauge length were used and tensile measurements were \n 5\nperformed at a crosshead speed of 5mm min-1. At least 10 specimens were tested to \nobtain an average value. \n \n3 Results and discussion \n3.1 Colloidal processing of PZT suspensions \nFigure 1 shows the variation of the Zeta potential of a 1 vol.% PZT suspension as a \nfunction of pH. Stabilisation of PZT particles in water was achieved by electrostatic \nmeans using acetic acid and ammonium hydroxide. Figure 1 shows that the IEP of PZT \nis approximately pH 6.5, ie the pH at which the Zeta Potential is zero. \n \nElectrosteric stabilisation of PZT particles in water was achieved by using D3021. The \nZeta potential of a 1 vol.% PZT aqueous suspension containing 1 wt % D3021 (PZT \ndried weight basis) measured as a function of pH is shown in Figure 1. At pH 10.2 the \ncharge on the ceramic particles has increased significantly from -30 mV to \u2013 60 mV on \nthe addition of D3021 to the PZT suspension. \n \npH is known to affect the extent of dissociation of the polyelectrolyte in water. The \ndissociation of the polyelectrolyte increases as the pH increases. This effect can be seen \nin Figure 1, where at low pH values (< pH 6.0) the polyelectrolyte is almost \nundissociated and so possess a low charge (< -20 mV). Subsequently at high pH values \n(> pH 10.0) the polyelectrolyte is fully dissociated which leads to a large charge (> - \n60mV). \n \n 6\nFigure 2 shows the measure of conductivity of the suspension as D3021 is added to a 1 \nvol.% aqueous PZT suspension. The conductivity of the suspension increased on the \naddition of D3021. This increasing trend could be due to an increase in concentration of \nions in solution. Since D3021 dissociates in water to produce negatively charged \npolyions, such as RCOO- and positively charged counter ions, in this case NH4+ ions the \nincrease in conductivity of the suspension could due to increasing release of free NH4+ \nand any free or excess negatively charged polyions in solution. \n \n3.2 Optimisation of the dispersant concentration \nThe optimum dispersant level is the concentration of dispersant (in wt.% based on \nceramic powder dried weight basis, dwb) required to provide the maximum level of \nstabilisation of particles in a slip. This helps to produce a uniformly dispersed slurry, in \nwhich flocculation and sedimentation of particles can be reduced during casting and \ndrying. As a result, homogenous, crack-free green tapes can be produced. Figure 3 \nshows the variation in viscosity, at 100 s-1 of a 20 and 30 vol. % PZT suspension as a \nfunction of D3021 concentration. On D3021 addition the viscosity decreased indicating \nan increasing adsorption of the dispersant onto the PZT powder particles. From Figure 3 \na viscosity minima was observed for both 20 and 30 vol.% PZT at approximately 1.0 wt \n% D3021 (PZT dwb). Slurries with 30 vol.% PZT solids loading exhibited a higher \nviscosity as compared to the 20 vol.% PZT suspension. This is expected as more \nparticles in the suspension decrease the interparticle separation distances in the \nsuspension. \n \n 7\n3.3 Rheology of tape casting slurries \nThe rheological behaviour of the PZT slip listed in Table 1 exhibited a shear thinning \ntype flow behaviour (Figure 4). Shear thinning flow behaviours of suspensions usually \nindicate a weakly flocculated system (4). However, this type of flow behaviour is \ndesirable in tape casting as low shear rates render a high viscosity of the slip at rest, \nwhich helps to prevent flocculation and sedimentation of particles during drying and at \nhigh shear rates the slip possess a low enough viscosity for tape casting. At a shear rate \nof 100 s-1 the viscosity remains approximately at 0.2 Pa.s. \n \nFigure 4 shows the shear stress versus shear rate curves for the full PZT slip (Table 1). \nThe shear stress of slips shows an almost identical increase and decrease with shear rate \nwith little or no hysteresis. This indicates that the flow behaviour of the slips may not be \ntime dependent or thixotropic. \n \n3.4 Mechanical properties of green tapes \nThe mechanical behaviour of the green PZT tape which was made by tape casting using \nthe slip composition listed in Table 1 was measured using tensile testing. The ultimate \ntensile strength of the tape was 0.014 MPa with a standard deviation of 0.002 MPa and \nthe strain to failure of PZT green tapes was 0.013 mm\/mm with a standard deviation of \n0.004 mm\/mm. These mechanical properties produced sufficient handling of the green \ntapes for further processing ie subsequent binder burnout and sintering stages. Green \ntapes produced a maximum green density of 4.40 g cm-3. \n \n 8\n4 Conclusions \nPZT suspensions were stabilised both electrostatically using acetic acid and \nelectrosterically by adsorption of dissociated dispersant molecules on ceramic particles. \nHowever electrosteric mechanisms proved to be more effective at stabilising PZT \nparticles in water. The isoelectric point of PZT was found to be around pH 6.5. \nViscosity measurements were used to find the optimum dispersant concentration, which \ncorresponded to 1.0 wt.% D3021 (PZT dwb). The rheological behaviour of the slip \nproved to be shear thinning corresponding to a weakly flocculated system with very \nlittle time dependent viscosity effects. However robust, defect-free PZT green tapes \nwere produced for subsequent processing such as binder burnout and sintering. \n \nAcknowledgements: This work would not have been possible without financial support \nfrom IRISYS Ltd. and EPSRC.
