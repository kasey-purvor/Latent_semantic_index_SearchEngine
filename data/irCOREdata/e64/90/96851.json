S003613999732857X\n1. Introduction. The vast range of patterns and structures observed in animals\ndevelops from the apparently homogeneous mass of cells that constitutes the early\nembryo. In an attempt to understand the underlying mechanisms of this process,\ntermed morphogenesis, mathematical modeling has been used extensively.\nMost mathematical models for morphogenesis focus on synchronous pattern for-\nmation (see Murray (1989) for a review). However, morphogenetic processes fre-\nquently occur sequentially. Regular patterns of repeated units often develop at a\nfrontier of pattern formation (Zeeman (1974)) which moves across the prospective\narea to transform unstructured tissue into an array of patterned components.\nA typical example of sequential skin pattern formation is in the chick embryo\nwhere feather germ initiation occurs sequentially, row by row, with the first row\nbeing laid down on the dorsal midline (Davidson (1983a), (1983b)). Similar waves of\npattern formation also occur, for example, in the development of somites (Pearson\nand Elsdale (1979)), scales (Maderson (1965a), (1965b)), and alligator skin patterns\n(Murray, Deeming, and Ferguson (1990)).\nRecently, Cruywagen and Murray (1992) proposed a novel tissue interaction\nmodel for describing skin patterning. As was demonstrated by Cruywagen and Murray\n(1992) and Cruywagen, Maini, and Murray (1997), their tissue interaction model can\naccount for synchronous patterning. The model can also exhibit propagating patterns.\nFor example, Cruywagen, Maini, and Murray (1992) showed that the model, solved on\na rectangular domain, can exhibit propagating patterns resulting in stripes, consistent\nwith patterns observed in the developing alligator embryo, or rhombic structures, con-\nsistent with those observed during feather germ formation on embryonic dorsal chick\nskin. In both of these cases, sequential pattern formation resulted from a small lo-\n\u2217Received by the editors October 8, 1997; accepted for publication (in revised form) March 30,\n1999; published electronically July 5, 2000.\nhttp:\/\/www.siam.org\/journals\/siap\/61-1\/32857.html\n\u2020Sea Fisheries Research Institute, Private Bag X2, Rogge Bay, 8012 Cape Town, South Africa\n(gcruywag%boland@mus.cstat.co.za).\n\u2021Centre for Mathematical Biology, Mathematical Institute, 24\u201329 St. Giles\u2019, Oxford, UK (maini@\nmaths.ox.ac.uk).\n\u00a7Department of Applied Mathematics, Box 352420, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195\n(murrayjd@amath.washington.edu).

In most cases the wave sweeps across the\ndomain as the variable switches from one unstable, homogeneous steady state to\nanother stable, uniform steady state. Such models were first studied by Fisher (1937)\nand Kolmogoroff, Patrovsky, and Piscounoff (1937), who showed how to determine\nthe wave speed of the front by first transforming to traveling wave coordinates.\nThe traveling waves that we investigate in this paper are rather different because\nthey consist of a traveling front that leaves in its wake a spatially varying steady\nstate solution. Myerscough and Murray (1992) analyzed such traveling waves for a\ncell-chemotaxis model and used the method of steepest descents to find the speed of\nthe traveling front. In this paper, we propose a new method, using envelope functions,\nfor determining the wave speed of such propagating patterns. This method is valid in\nthe vicinity of the bifurcation point from the homogeneous steady state solutions to\npatterned steady state solutions.\nIn section 2 we briefly describe the basic tissue interaction model of Cruywagen\nand Murray (1992) which we believe is currently one of the more biologically realistic\nmodels for pattern formation. Using linear analysis, we delimit regions in a parameter\nspace where the uniform steady state of this system is unstable and, using a weakly\nnonlinear analysis, we determine, analytically, the spatially varying pattern to which\nthe solutions evolve.\nIn section 3 we demonstrate that sequential pattern formation can be induced\nby a small localized disturbance in the tissue, which subsequently develops into a\nspatially varying pattern that propagates through the domain. A crucial observation\nis that the envelope of the solutions exhibits a traveling wave-like behavior from\none spatially uniform state to another. We exploit this behavior in section 4 to\ngeneralize the Fisher-type analysis to such traveling waves. In section 5 we illustrate\nthe application of this method by considering a specific example. It is important to\nnote that this method is applicable in general to all pattern formation models that\nexhibit such traveling wave behavior. We use the tissue interaction model here merely\nby way of example.\n2. Model equations. Vertebrate skin is composed of two layers\u2014the epidermis\nand the dermis. Skin organ formation typically occurs due to interaction between\nthese two layers. For example, in chick skin a feather germ arises as a result of tissue\ninteraction leading to an aggregation of dermal cells, termed a papilla, underlying\na thickening in the epidermis, termed a primordium. The model we consider here\nconsists of two coupled equations, one for each layer. A crucial aspect of the biology\ncaptured by this model is that the pattern can only occur as a result of both layers in-\nteracting with one another. (For a discussion of modeling tissue interaction in general,\nsee Murray and Cruywagen (1994) and Murray, Cruywagen, and Maini (1994).)\nHere we consider a reduced tissue interaction model. Details of the full model\ncan be found in Appendix A of this paper, and Cruywagen and Murray (1992). Cruy-\nwagen, Maini, and Murray (1997) show that this reduced model captures the salient\nfeatures of the full model.\nThe reduced model focuses on the two key field variables\u2014\u03b8(x, t), which repre-\nsents the epithelial dilation, and n(x, t), which is the dermal cell density at position\nx (we are considering the one-dimensional case only) and time t.\nENVELOPE METHOD 215\nThe nondimensionalized model is\neffects of passive forces\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\n\u00b5\n\u22023\u03b8\n\u2202t\u2202x2\n+\n\u22022\u03b8\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 \u03b2 \u2202\n4\u03b8\n\u2202x4\n+\nactive traction\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\n\u22022\n\u2202x2\n{\n\u03c4n2\n[1 + \u03bd(1\u2212 \u03b8)]2 + cn2\n}\n=\nbody forces\ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37\n\u03c1\u03b8 ,(2.1a)\n\u2202n\n\u2202t\n=\ndiffusion\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\nD\n\u22022n\n\u2202x2\n\u2212\nchemotaxis\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\n\u03b1\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n{\nn\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n1\u2212 \u03b8\n1 + \u03b3n\n)}\n+\ncell growth\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\nn(1\u2212 n) ,(2.1b)\nwhere \u00b5, \u03b2, \u03c4 , \u03bd, c, \u03c1, D, \u03b1, and \u03b3 are positive parameters.\nThe tissue interaction in these caricature equations is represented in (2.1a) by the\nfourth term on the left-hand side, in which cell traction in the epidermis is a function\nof dermal cell density, and in (2.1b) by the second term on the right-hand side, in\nwhich dermal cell chemotaxis is a function of the dilation in the epidermis.\nEquations (2.1) admit the spatially homogeneous steady states\nn = 0, \u03b8 = 0 and n = 1, \u03b8 = 0.\nSince we are interested in spatial pattern formation occurring in established cell popu-\nlations, the trivial steady state is irrelevant. (For traveling wave solutions connecting\nthe two steady states refer to Cruywagen, Maini, and Murray (1994).)\nWe linearize about the nontrivial steady state in the usual way to obtain the\ndispersion relation \u03bb(k2) for the temporal growth of perturbations of wave number k as\n\u03bb(k2) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\u2212b(k2) + \u0002\n(\u221a\nb2(k2)\u2212 4a(k2)c(k2)\n)\n2a(k2)\nif k2 \u0003= 0,\n\u2212r if k2 = 0,\n(2.2)\nwhere\na(k2) = \u00b5k2,\nb(k2) = (\u00b5D + \u00b5Q1 + \u03b2)k\n4 + (P1 + 1 + \u00b5r)k\n2 + \u03c1,\nc(k2) = \u03b2(D +Q1)k\n6 \u2212 (P2Q2 \u2212 r\u03b2 \u2212DP1 \u2212 P1Q1 \u2212D \u2212Q1)k4\n+ (r + rP1 + \u03c1D + \u03c1Q1)k\n2 + \u03c1r,\nand\nP1 =\n2\u03c4\u03bd(1 + \u03bd)\n(1 + 2\u03bd + \u03bd2 + c)2\n,(2.3a)\nP2 =\n2\u03c4(1 + 2\u03bd + \u03bd2)\n(1 + 2\u03bd + \u03bd2 + c)2\n,(2.3b)\nQ1 =\n\u03b1\u03b3\n(1 + \u03b3)2\n,(2.3c)\nQ2 =\n\u03b1\n1 + \u03b3\n.(2.3d)\nSpatially heterogeneous solutions of the linear system are characterized by a dis-\npersion relation satisfying \u0002\u03bb(0) \u2264 0 but which exhibits a range of modes correspond-\ning to the eigenvalues k2 > 0 with \u0002\u03bb(k2) > 0. In this case, the uniform steady state\n216 GERHARD CRUYWAGEN, PHILIP MAINI, AND JAMES MURRAY\nis unstable to spatially heterogeneous perturbations, and these modes grow initially.\nAs the amplitudes of these modes increase and the linear approximation is no longer\nvalid, it is the form of the nonlinearities that is crucial in determining the final pat-\ntern. Cruywagen and Murray (1992) and Cruywagen, Maini, and Murray (1997) used\nextensive numerical simulation, steady state analyses, and weakly nonlinear bifurca-\ntion analyses to show that, in the vicinity of a primary bifurcation point, the linear\nstability analysis gives a very good indication as to the form of the solution of the full\nnonlinear problem.\nIn this paper, we consider a simplified version of the reduced model in which D,\nr, and \u00b5 are set equal to zero. This simplification is biologically realistic because the\ndermal cell diffusion effect is very small compared to the chemotactic term, cell pro-\nliferation appears to cease when pattern formation starts, and the epidermal viscosity\ncoefficient is believed to be relatively very small. The parameter \u03b3 is used as the bifur-\ncation parameter, with the critical value \u03b3 = \u03b3c corresponding to the neutrally stable\ncase for the homogeneous steady state; that is where \u03bb(k2c ) = 0 for a critical k\n2\nc . By\nsetting \u03b3 = \u03b3c \u2212 \u00192, where \u0019 \u0005 1, the steady state becomes marginally unstable and\na nonlinear perturbation analysis can be carried out (see Appendix B of this paper\nand Cruywagen and Murray (1992)). The general one-dimensional solution obtained\non the infinite domain is(\n\u03b8\nn\n)\n=\n(\n0\n1\n)\n+ \u0019\n(\n1\nM\n)\n(A cos kcx+B sin kcx) +O(\u0019\n2) as T \u2192\u221e,(2.4)\nwhere A2+B2 = \u2212\u0393\/\u2126, with \u2126 and \u0393 complex expressions of the model parameters,\nM = \u2212(\u03b3c + 1)\/\u03b3c, and T is a slow timescale (see Appendix B).\n3. Propagating patterns. Cruywagen and Murray (1992) solved the tissue\ninteraction system on a one-dimensional spatial domain. As initial conditions they\nused random perturbations about the homogeneous steady states for the dermal cell\ndensity n and the epithelial dilation \u03b8. This led to a pattern of peaks and troughs\ndeveloping simultaneously across the whole domain. If, however, a perturbation is\nmade in, say, the dermal cell density n in just one small region on a very large domain,\nthe pattern is generated progressively. In effect the initial conditions, as specified in\nthis case, give rise to a propagating wave of pattern.\nThis behavior can be illustrated by solving the simplified reduced model numeri-\ncally. Figure 1 shows the solution obtained when the model is solved using the NAG\nFORTRAN routine D03PGF for the parameter set\n\u03b3c = 1.0\u2212 \u00192, c = 1.0, \u03bd = 4.0, \u03b1 = 4.0,\n\u03c4 = 6.25, \u03b2 = 0.011258, \u03c1 = 88.826,\nwhere \u03b3c is the bifurcation parameter and \u0019 = 0.1. The system was solved on the\ndomain [0, 30] with zero-flux boundary conditions. Initially n and \u03b8 were set to their\nrespective homogeneous steady states, \u03b8 = 0 and n = 1, on the whole domain, except\nfor a small region at the origin. Here we specified small random perturbations about\nthe steady state.\nAs expected these perturbations develop into a coherent spatial pattern which\ngradually propagates outward into the rest of the domain. The result is a traveling\nwave of pattern formation propagating from the origin toward the other end of the\ndomain. Figure 1 illustrates how the pattern in dermal cell density progresses with\nENVELOPE METHOD 217\nFig. 1. The time evolution of propagating patterns generated from random initial conditions at\nthe origin by solving (2.1) with parameter values as shown in section 3. (a) t = 15, (b) t = 22, and\n(c) t = 29.\ntime (since the pattern in dilation is similar to that for the dermal cell density, we\nonly show the latter). This type of behavior is similar to that obtained by Myerscough\nand Murray (1992) for a reaction-diffusion\u2013chemotaxis model.\nFar away from the initial disturbance, the wavelength of the standing pattern and\nits speed of propagation seem to be constant and independent of the initial conditions.\nThis motivates us to look for analytical methods to determine expressions for these\nquantities.\n4. Envelope technique for propagating pattern analysis. By connecting\nthe peaks and troughs of the evolving cell density and cell dilation patterns one can\nconstruct envelopes which enclose the developing patterns (see Figure 2(a)). It is\ncrucial to note that these envelopes travel at the same speed as the propagating\npatterns. Here we use the properties of these envelopes to determine the approximate\nminimum wave speed of the spreading pattern.\nWe introduce a coordinate system moving with the traveling pattern by the usual\nchange of variables z = x \u2212 vt, where v is a positive constant. We are thus con-\ncerned with patterns propagating in the positive x-direction. The assumption that\nthe patterns travel at a constant speed v is based on the results of extensive numerical\n218 GERHARD CRUYWAGEN, PHILIP MAINI, AND JAMES MURRAY\nFig. 2.

The following properties are ascribed to the envelope functions:\nlim\nz\u2192\u221e p(z) = 0, limz\u2192\u221e q(z) = 0, limz\u2192\u221e s(z) = 0,(4.2a)\nlim\nz\u2192\u2212\u221e p(z) = 1, limz\u2192\u2212\u221e q(z) = 1, limz\u2192\u2212\u221e s(z) = 1.(4.2b)\nWe further assume that the solution of the system (4.1) can be expressed as\n\u03b8(x, z) = p(z)\u03b8G(x, z),(4.3a)\nn(x, z) = q(z)[nG(x, z)\u2212 nA] + s(z)(nA \u2212 1) + 1,(4.3b)\nwhere \u03b8G and nG are functions that will be determined below. The value nA is the\naverage dermal cell density as z \u2192 \u2212\u221e,\nnA = lim\nz\u2192\u2212\u221e\n1\nP\n\u222b P\n0\nn(x, z)dx,\nwhere P is the period of the steady state spatial pattern at z = \u2212\u221e.\nThe motivation for taking these solution forms comes from examination of the\nsolutions illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, in which it is apparent that the solutions can\nbe approximated very closely by a constant wavelength spatial pattern that has an\namplitude that decreases monotonically. Note that the envelope function s(z) appears\nin the expression for n(x, z). This is because the average cell density, nA, of the final\nsolution is not necessarily equal to the initial average cell density n = 1, which is\nthe homogeneous steady state value. So we have to track the change in average\ncell density, which is due to the logistic growth term in our dermal cell conservation\nequation, as well as the change in the developing pattern. In fact, in the simplified\nversion of the model that will be considered below, the logistic growth term is set to\nzero and this envelope term disappears.\nTo determine the functions nG(x, z) and \u03b8G(x, z), we examine the solution be-\nhavior in the limit as z \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. Far behind the leading edge of the disturbance,\nthat is, where z \u2192 \u2212\u221e, the system is at a spatially periodic steady state, say S1.\nWe represent this steady state pattern by S1 = (\u03b8S1(x), nS1(x))\nT , which is also the\nsolution of the z-independent nonlinear problem. So, from (4.2) and (4.3) it follows\nthat\nlim\nz\u2192\u2212\u221e\n(\n\u03b8G(x, z)\nnG(x, z)\n)\n=\n(\n\u03b8S1(x)\nnS1(x)\n)\n.\nFar ahead of the leading edge of the disturbance, that is, as z \u2192\u221e, the system is\nat the homogeneous steady state S0, where S0 = (0, 1). As the disturbance propagates\ninto the homogeneous region, the steady state is perturbed and a spatially periodic\nsolution begins to evolve. We represent the form of this initial pattern in dilation and\ncell density by the functions \u03b8S0(x) and nS0(x), respectively. In terms of the above\nexpressions (4.2) and (4.3) this means that\nlim\nz\u2192\u221e\n(\n\u03b8G(x, z)\nnG(x, z)\n)\n=\n(\n\u03b8S0(x)\nnS0(x)\n)\n.\nAdditionally, we assume that the amplitudes of the periodic functions \u03b8S0(x) and\nnS0(x), representing the initial shape of the patterns, are the same as the amplitudes\nof the final pattern \u03b8S1(x) and nS1(x). The change in form of the initial pattern\n220 GERHARD CRUYWAGEN, PHILIP MAINI, AND JAMES MURRAY\nat S0 into the final pattern at S1 is tracked by the functions \u03b8G(x, z) and nG(x, z).\nHowever, in the vicinity of a primary bifurcation from the uniform steady state,\nthe most significant change in the patterns is in their amplitudes, while changes\nin their shapes are negligible in comparison (see Figure 1). Hence, we will assume\nthat \u03b8G(x, z) and nG(x, z) are independent of z and thus that the final steady state\npattern far behind the wave is the same shape as the initially evolving pattern at the\nleading edge of the wave, with the amplitudes tracked by the envelope functions. For\nnotational convenience we shall write(\n\u03b8S(x)\nnS(x)\n)\n\u2248\n(\n\u03b8G(x, z)\nnG(x, z)\n)\n.\nWe now study the phase space of the above system which has the two (z-independent)\nsteady states S1 = (\u03b8S1(x), nS1(x)) and S0 = (0, 1). The system has a propagating\npattern solution if and only if there exists a trajectory in the phase space connecting\nthese two steady states. By linearizing about these steady states, one can examine\ntheir stability to see whether such a trajectory is possible.\nWe begin by linearizing about S1, by setting\n\u03b8(x, z) = \u03b8S(x) + p\u02dc(z)\u03b8S(x),(4.4a)\nn(x, z) = nS(x) + q\u02dc(z)nS(x),(4.4b)\nwhere\n|q\u02dc(z)| \u0005 1 and |p\u02dc(z)| \u0005 1.\nBecause of our assumption that the form of the pattern stays fixed while the am-\nplitudes of the propagating patterns change, only the amplitudes of the pattern are\nperturbed about the steady state.\nBy substituting (4.4) into (4.1) for the simplified model, that is, with D = \u00b5 =\nr = 0, and dropping the tildes for algebraic convenience, we have the linear system(\n\u22022\n\u2202z2\n+ 2\n\u22022\n\u2202z\u2202x\n+\n\u22022\n\u2202x2\n)\n(p\u03b8S)\n\u2212\u03b2\n(\n\u22024\n\u2202z4\n+ 4\n\u22024\n\u2202z3\u2202x\n+ 6\n\u22024\n\u2202z2\u2202x2\n+ 4\n\u22024\n\u2202z\u2202x3\n+\n\u22024p\u03b8S\n\u2202x4\n)\n(p\u03b8S)\n+\n(\n\u22022\n\u2202z2\n+\n\u22022\n\u2202z\u2202x\n+\n\u22022\n\u2202x2\n)\n(U1(x)p\u03b8S + U2(x)qnS) = \u03c1p\u03b8S ,(4.5a)\n\u2212 v \u2202\n\u2202z\n(qnS) =\n(\n\u2202\n\u2202z\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n){\nqnS\n(\n\u2202\n\u2202z\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n)\nW0(x)\n+nS\n(\n\u2202\n\u2202z\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n)\n(W1(x)qnS +W2(x)p\u03b8S)\n}\n,(4.5b)\nwhere\nU1(x) =\n2\u03c4\u03bd[1 + \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd\u03b8S(x)]\n{[1 + \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd\u03b8S(x)]2 + cn2S(x)}2\n,\nU2(x) =\n2\u03c4nS(x)[1 + \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd\u03b8S(x)]2\n{[1 + \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd\u03b8S(x)]2 + cn2S(x)}2\n,\nENVELOPE METHOD 221\nand\nW0(x) =\n\u2212\u03b1[1\u2212 \u03b8S(x)]\n1 + \u03b3nS(x)\n,\nW1(x) =\n\u03b1\u03b3[1\u2212 \u03b8S(x)]\n[1 + \u03b3nS(x)]2\n,\nW2(x) =\n\u03b1\n1 + \u03b3nS(x)\n.\nLikewise, we linearize about the steady state S0 by setting\n\u03b8(x, z) = p\u02dc(z)\u03b8S(x),(4.6a)\nn(x, z) = 1 + q\u02dc(z)nS(x),(4.6b)\nwhere\n|q\u02dc(z)| \u0005 1 and |p\u02dc(z)| \u0005 1.\nSubstituting this into (4.1) and dropping the tildes gives(\n\u22022\n\u2202z2\n+ 2\n\u22022\n\u2202z\u2202x\n+\n\u22022\n\u2202x2\n)\n(p\u03b8S)\n\u2212\u03b2\n(\n\u22024\n\u2202z4\n+ 4\n\u22024\n\u2202z3\u2202x\n+ 6\n\u22024\n\u2202z2\u2202x2\n+ 4\n\u22024\n\u2202z\u2202x3\n+\n\u22024p\u03b8S\n\u2202x4\n)\n(p\u03b8S)\n+\n(\n\u22022\n\u2202z2\n+\n\u22022\n\u2202z\u2202x\n+\n\u22022\n\u2202x2\n)\n(P1p\u03b8S + P2qnS) = \u03c1p\u03b8S ,(4.7a)\n\u2212 v \u2202\n\u2202z\n(qnS) =\n(\n\u22022\n\u2202z2\n+ 2\n\u22022\n\u2202z\u2202x\n+\n\u22022\n\u2202x2\n)\n(Q1qnS +Q2p\u03b8S) ,(4.7b)\nwhere P1, P2, Q1, and Q2 are as in (2.3).\nThese linear systems are extremely complicated and it is very difficult to carry\nout a stability analysis in general because we do not know the functions \u03b8S(x) and\nnS(x). However, we can approximate these functions in the vicinity of a primary\nbifurcation from the uniform steady state by using the weakly nonlinear perturbation\ntechnique detailed in Appendix B for the case where \u03b3 is the bifurcation parameter.\nFor the purpose of our explanation below we briefly refer back to system (2.1),\nwhich is the above set of equations (4.1) written in terms of the space and time\ncoordinates x and t. In section 2 we showed that this system bifurcates from the\nhomogeneous steady state S0 if the dispersion relation (see (2.2)) becomes positive for\nsome critical eigenvalue k2c . This happens, for example, if the bifurcation parameter \u03b3\nbecomes marginally smaller than the critical value \u03b3c. By setting \u03b3 = \u03b3c \u2212 \u00192, where\n\u0019 is the small perturbation parameter, an approximate nonhomogeneous steady state\nsolution for large time (see (2.4)) was found by Cruywagen and Murray (1992) by a\nmultiple time scale analysis (refer to Appendix B of this paper).\nThe perturbation solution is valid for the traveling coordinate system (4.1) in the\nregion where z \u2192 \u2212\u221e and is in fact the steady state solution S1. Hence, from (2.4),\nwe have that (\n\u03b8S1(x)\nnS1(x)\n)\n= \u039b\n(\n1\nM\n)\n(A cos kcx+B sin kcx) +O(\u0019\n2),(4.8)\n222 GERHARD CRUYWAGEN, PHILIP MAINI, AND JAMES MURRAY\nwhere the amplitude is given by \u039b, M is as in section 2, and A2 + B2 is given in\nsection 2 and Appendix B.\nNext we look at the steady state S0 as z \u2192 \u221e and more specifically at the\nfunctions \u03b8S0 and nS0 . Initially, for t very small, the solution of (2.1) evolves from the\nhomogeneous steady state \u03b8 = 0, n = 1. Since the variables initially take values close\nto their steady state values we can approximate the nonlinear system by a linearized\nversion about the steady state. The linear solution of (2.1), obtained for large time,\ncan be written as(\n\u03b8(x, t)\nn(x, t)\n)\n\u2248\n(\n0\n1\n)\n+\n\u222b kR\nkL\npf (k)\n(\n1\nM\n)\ne\u03bb(k\n2)t(A cos kx+B sin kx)dk,\nwhere pf (k) is determined by a Fourier transform of the initial conditions, A and B are\narbitrary constants,M is as before, and [kL, kR] is the range of unstable wavenumbers.\nWhen performing the weakly nonlinear analysis (see Appendix B) it is assumed that,\nsince we are in the vicinity of the bifurcation point, the linear solution with the critical\neigenvalue k2c is the dominant one and, for small enough \u0019, the only one that evolves\ninitially. So, using expressions (4.2) and (4.3) we can write(\n\u03b8S0(x)\nnS0(x)\n)\n= \u039b\n(\n1\nM\n)\n(A cos kcx+B sin kcx),(4.9)\nwhere we have multiplied the solution by \u039b so that the amplitudes of \u03b8S0(x) and\nnS0(x) are rescaled to be the same as the amplitudes of the final steady state solution\n(4.8).\nOur initial pattern (\u03b8S0(x, z), nS0(x, z))\nT , far ahead of the leading edge of the\ntraveling wave, is, to O(\u0019), the same as the final pattern (\u03b8S1(x), nS1(x))\nT , far behind\nthe wave. This means that our solution (\u03b8(x, z), n(x, z))T is, to O(\u0019), separable in a\nx-independent part (p, q)T and a z-independent part (nG, \u03b8G)\nT .\nHence, to O(\u0019), we can approximate these functions by(\n\u03b8S\nnS\n)\n= \u039b\n(\n1\nM\n)\n(A cos kcx+B sin kcx).(4.10)\nSubstituting this into the linearized system (4.5), ignoring terms of O(\u00192), and\nequating coefficients of cos kcx, we get the following two equations:\n\u03b2Ap\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 + 4\u03b2Bp\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2212 (1 + 6\u03b2k2c + P1)Ap\u2032\u2032 \u2212 (2kc + 4\u03b2k3c + P1kc)Bp\u2032\n+ (k2c + \u03b2k\n4\nc + P1k\n2\nc + \u03c1)Ap =MP2(Aq\n\u2032\u2032 + kcBq\u2032 \u2212 k2cAq),(4.11a)\nQ2Ap\n\u2032\u2032 + 2Q2kcBp\u2032 \u2212Q2Ak2cp = \u2212MQ1Aq\u2032\u2032\n\u2212 (vAM + 2MQ1kcB)q\u2032 +MQ1k2cAq,(4.11b)\nwhere the prime indicates differentiation with respect to z.\nLikewise, by equating coefficients of sin kcx, we obtain\n\u03b2Bp\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2212 4\u03b2Ap\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2212 (1 + 6\u03b2k2c + P1)Bp\u2032\u2032 + (2kc + 4\u03b2k3c + P1kc)Ap\u2032\n+ (k2c \u2212 \u03b2k4c + P1k2c \u2212 \u03c1)Bp =MP2(Bq\u2032\u2032 \u2212 kcAq\u2032 \u2212 k2cBq),(4.12a)\nQ2Bp\n\u2032\u2032 \u2212 2Q2kcAp\u2032 \u2212Q2Bk2cp = \u2212MQ1Bq\u2032\u2032\n+ (vMB + 2MQ1kcA)q\n\u2032 +MQ1k2cBq.(4.12b)\nENVELOPE METHOD 223\nWe now add (4.11a) to (4.12a) and (4.11b) to (4.12b) after multiplying (4.11) by A\nand (4.12) by B.

We substitute (4.10) and (4.9) into (4.7), follow the same procedure as\nabove, and find that the linearized system about S0 is exactly the same as the system\n(4.13). The complexity of the two original linear systems has now been reduced\nconsiderably\u2014they are dependent only on the variable z and are written in terms of\nthe envelope functions p and q.\nBy setting\np0 = p, p1 = p\n\u2032, p2 = p\u2032\u2032, p3 = p\u2032\u2032\u2032, q0 = q, q1 = q\u2032,\nthe coupled pair of ordinary differential equations (4.13) can be written as a sixth-\norder system, namely,\np\u20320 = p1,\np\u20321 = p2,\np\u20322 = p3,\np\u20323 =\n1\n\u03b2\n[(\n\u2212\u03b2k4c \u2212 (P1 + 1\u2212\nP2Q2\nQ1\n)k2c \u2212 \u03c1\n)\np0\n+\n(\n6\u03b2k2c + P1 + 1\u2212\nP2Q2\nQ1\n)\np2 +\nP2Q2v\nQ21\nq1\n]\n,\nq\u20320 = q1,\nq\u20321 = p2 \u2212 k2c \u2212\nv\nQ1\nq1 + k\n2\ncq0.\nWe examine the stability of this system in the usual way by looking for solutions\nof the form\n(p0, p1, p2, p3, q0, q1)\nT =W e\u03b7z,(4.14)\nwhere the vector W is constant and the sign of \u0002\u03b7 determines the stability of the\nsteady state.\nSubstituting (4.14) into the linearized system of equations leads to a system of\nsix homogeneous equations.

As necessary conditions for such a trajectory\nto exist, an unstable manifold at S1 and a stable manifold at S0 are required. The\nsolvability condition (4.15), which is valid to O(\u0019) at both steady states, allows for\nboth stable and unstable manifolds. Notice, however, that these are not sufficient\nconditions; whether there indeed exists a trajectory connecting the steady state S1 to\nS0 cannot be proven in general.\n5. Applying the envelope method. Here we consider a specific example to\nillustrate how the envelope method can be used to predict the wave speed of the\npropagating patterns. We chose the parameter set given in section 3 and set \u0019 = 0.01\nso that we are in the vicinity of the bifurcation point. For this parameter set, the\npolynomial (4.15) has two positive and two negative roots for all v \u2265 0 and hence\nwe have at least a two-dimensional stable manifold and a two-dimensional unstable\nmanifold. This suggests that a trajectory from S1 to S0 is possible for any speed\nv \u2265 0. This is inconsistent with the numerical results of section 3 which show that\nthe solution propagates at a fixed wave speed depending on the parameter set chosen.\nCloser inspection of (4.15) reveals that, for this parameter set, two more negative\neigenvalues appear as the parameter v increases. If we hypothesize that the stable\nmanifold at S0, into which the connecting trajectory shoots, is represented by these\nENVELOPE METHOD 225\nFig. 3. The solvability condition (4.15) with parameter values as in section 3 and \u0002 = 0.01.\n(a) All the roots of the polynomial are shown. (b) The double root that appears as the wave speed v\nincreases through 0.13.\nTable 1\nA comparison of the wave speeds obtained for the propagating pattern from the asymptotic\nmethod, the envelope method, and the numerical simulations.\n\u0002 Numerical result Envelope method Asymptotic method\n0.01 0.13 0.13 0.13\n0.1 1.35 1.33 1.36\n0.5 9.4 - 9.9\ntwo roots, we can get a bound on v. One can find the minimum value of v, for which\nthese two new roots appear as a double negative root. This value of v would then\nrepresent a lower bound on the wave speed of the traveling pattern. Although we\ncannot prove the existence of a trajectory connecting the steady states S0 and S1,\nsuch a trajectory seems highly likely in light of the numerical experiments performed\nbelow.\nNumerically we found that the double negative root appeared at a minimum value\nof v = 0.13 (see Figure 3). The actual speed at which the pattern propagates, as was\nfound from the numerical simulations, agrees exactly with this prediction. As is the\ncase for the Fisher wave (see, for example, Murray (1989)) we see that our wave of\npattern formation indeed travels at, or very close to, the minimum speed, since it\nagrees well with the analytical approximation for the minimum speed.\nIf we choose \u0019 = 0.1, our analytical approximation of v = 1.33 compares favorably\nwith the actual numerically computed speed of 1.35. However, if we move still further\naway from the bifurcation point, this method breaks down, as one would expect (see\nTable 1 for a summary of the results).\nExtensive numerical simulations show that this method works well. To test the\ngeneral applicability of this envelope method for determining the minimum wave speed\nat which waves of pattern formation travel, we applied the method to a reaction-\ndiffusion system. For the purpose of our analysis we chose the Schnakenberg system,\none of the simplest reaction-diffusion systems (see Schnakenberg (1979)). Instead of\n226 GERHARD CRUYWAGEN, PHILIP MAINI, AND JAMES MURRAY\na sixth-order polynomial we found, as stability condition for the two steady states, a\nfourth-order polynomial. As we varied the wave speed we got either zero or two stable\nmanifolds at these steady states. Therefore if a trajectory connecting the two steady\nstates does exist a bound on the wave speed is obtained. The numerically computed\ntraveling wave speed compared favorably with the minimum wave speed predicted\nanalytically.\n6. Conclusion. We have proposed a new \u201cenvelope\u201d method for calculating\nthe speed of propagating patterns in a one-dimensional domain, arising from typical\nbiological pattern formation models such as reaction-diffusion and mechanochemical\nequations. As a specific example of a pattern formation system, we have considered\nthe tissue interaction model of Cruywagen and Murray (1992). Extensive numerical\nsimulations show that, in the vicinity of a primary bifurcation point, the spatially\nvarying steady state patterns forming far behind the advancing front of pattern are\nvery similar to those developing at the leading edge, the most notable difference being\nin the amplitude of the spatially periodic patterns. We track the change in amplitude\nby plotting the envelope function which is a traveling wave propagating with constant\nspeed. By transforming to traveling wave coordinates we conjecture that the speed of\npropagation is bounded below by the critical value of the speed v at which two of the\neigenvalues in the linearization change from being complex to being real via a double\nroot (Figure 3(b)).\nIn the classical Fisher model (Fisher (1937)), the system in traveling wave co-\nordinates is a pair of coupled ordinary differential equations with two steady states.\nThe minimum wave speed is at the critical value of v at which one of the steady\nstates changes from a stable node to a stable spiral. It can be rigorously shown\nthat a trajectory corresponding to a saddle-node connection exists for wave speeds\nabove this minimum value. Moreover, any initial conditions with compact support\nwill evolve into a wave traveling with this minimum wave speed (see, for example,\nMurray (1989)).\nIn this paper, our model system is a six-dimensional phase space and therefore\none cannot derive such rigorous results. Our numerical simulations suggest, however,\nthat the phenomenon of a minimum wave speed holds here as well. Due to the basic\nassumptions underpinning the envelope method, it has a high degree of accuracy in the\nvicinity of a bifurcation point but fails as one moves a substantial distance away from\nthe bifurcation point. We have tested other models (for example, reaction-diffusion\nmodels) and found that they too give results consistent with the above conjecture.\nThe envelope method is more generally applicable than the alternative asymptotic\nmethod proposed by Murray and Myerscough (1992) and mentioned in the introduc-\ntion of this paper. The asymptotic method is based on a quadratic approximation of\nthe dispersion relation. The accuracy with which the caricature dispersion relation\napproximates the full dispersion relation has an important effect on the accuracy of\nthe wave speed predicted by the asymptotic method. Moreover, in their approach it is\nunclear exactly how each parameter influences the wave speed as these do not appear\nin the caricature dispersion relation. Thus, one cannot directly relate parameters in\nthe caricature dispersion relation to actual model parameters. This contrasts with\nthe envelope method in which we can examine the effect that varying a particular\nparameter has on the dispersion relation and thus how it influences the wave speed.\nAppendix A. Here we briefly describe the tissue-interaction model. The reader\nis referred to Cruywagen and Murray (1992) for the full details of the derivation of\nthe model.\nENVELOPE METHOD 227\nThe model assumes that tissue interaction between the epithelial and dermal\nskin layers is mediated by two signal chemicals which are secreted in each layer,\nrespectively. These chemicals diffuse across the basal lamina\u2014a thin sheet separating\nthe dermis and epidermis\u2014thus transferring information between the layers.\nThe model consists of seven equations: four to describe the production, degra-\ndation, and diffusion of the chemicals within and between layers; two conservation\nequations for the dermal and epidermal cell densities, respectively; and finally, a force\nbalance equation for modeling stresses in the epithelium. As the chemical equations\nare standard, we shall not describe them here, but will instead focus on the force\nbalance and cell density equations.\nThe epithelium is modeled as a viscoelastic continuum at a low Reynolds number\nin which active traction forces exerted by the epidermal cells are balanced by elastic\nrestoring forces and external elastic tethering to the basal lamina. The force balance\nequation has the form\n\u2207 \u00b7\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nelastic stress\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\nE\n1 + \u03c5\n[\n\u03b5\u2212 \u03b21\u22072\u03b5+ \u03c5\n1\u2212 2\u03c5 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b22\u2207\n2\u03b8)I\n]\n+\nviscous stress\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\n\u00b51\n\u2202\u03b5\n\u2202t\n+ \u00b52\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202t\nI +\ntraction stress\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\n\u03c4s2\n1 + cs2\nI\n\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe =\nbody forces\ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37\n\u03c1u ,(A.1)\nwhere u(x, t) is the displacement at time t of a material point in the epithelium which\nwas initially at position x, \u03b8 = \u2207\u00b7u is the dilation, \u03b5 = 12 (\u2207u +\u2207uT ) is the strain\ntensor, where T denotes the transpose, and s(x, t) is the concentration of the signal\nchemical produced in the dermis. The parameters E and \u03c5 are Young\u2019s modulus\nand Poisson\u2019s ratio, respectively, while \u00b51 and \u00b52 are the shear and bulk viscosities,\nrespectively, I is the unit tensor, and \u03b21 and \u03b22 reflect long-range elastic stresses (see\nMurray (1989)). The traction stress is a switch function of the dermal signal chemical,\ns, with \u03c4 measuring the magnitude and c the abruptness of the switch.\nWe assume that the epidermal cells migrate due to convection only. Hence the\nepidermal cell density N(x, t) satisfies the conservation equation\n\u2202N\n\u2202t\n=\nconvection\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\n\u2212\u2207 \u00b7N \u2202u\n\u2202t\n.(A.2)\nThe conservation equation for dermal cell density, n(x, t), accounts for diffu-\nsion, mitosis, and chemotaxis toward the signal chemical produced in the epithelium.\nHence, the dermal chemotaxis equation is\n\u2202n\n\u2202t\n=\ndiffusion\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\nD\u22072n \u2212\nchemotaxis\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\n\u03b1\u2207 \u00b7 n\u2207e +\ncell growth\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\nrn(n\u00af\u2212 n) ,(A.3)\nwhere D is the coefficient of diffusion, \u03b1 is the chemotactic coefficient, e(x, t) is the\nconcentration of the signal chemical produced in the epithelium, and r and n\u00af are\npositive constants.\n228 GERHARD CRUYWAGEN, PHILIP MAINI, AND JAMES MURRAY\nWe can linearize about the uniform epidermal cell density steady state, say N\u02c6 , and\nintegrate (A.2) to obtain a linear relationship betweenN and \u03b8, namely, N = N\u02c6(1\u2212\u03b8).\nUsing this and assuming that the chemical kinetics occur on a fast timescale, one can\nfind actual algebraic expressions for the signal chemicals in terms of \u03b8 and n, namely,\ns = n\/(1 + \u03bd(1 \u2212 \u03b8)) and e = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)\/(1 + \u03b3n) (see Cruywagen and Murray (1992)\nfor full details). From these expressions we observe that the active traction stress in\nthe epidermis is induced by high concentrations of dermal cells, but inhibited by high\nconcentrations of epithelial cells. Similarly, dermal chemotaxis occurs toward high\nconcentrations of epithelial cells but is inhibited by high concentrations of dermal\ncells.\nThe simplified nondimensionalised set of equations is shown in section 2, equation\n(2.1), for one spatial dimension.\nAppendix B. Here we examine the time evolution of the nonlinear system\n(2.1) using a multiscale perturbation procedure on a one-dimensional domain. This\nshows how the different parameters are involved in determining the amplitude of the\npattern and gives conditions under which a steady state spatial pattern is attained.\nRefer to Cruywagen and Murray (1992) for further details and to Cruywagen, Maini,\nand Murray (1997) for the two-dimensional version of this analysis.\nWe are interested in the simplest biologically realistic version of the basic tissue\ninteraction model for which we can isolate any unstable wavenumber with an appro-\npriate parameter combination. We assume that D = 0, r = 0, and \u00b5 = 0 in (2.1).\nThe one-dimensional version of the reduced model is then\n\u22022\u03b8\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 \u03b2 \u2202\n4\u03b8\n\u2202x4\n+ \u03c4\n\u22022\n\u2202x2\nn2\n[1 + \u03bd(1\u2212 \u03b8)]2 + cn2 = \u03c1\u03b8,(B.1a)\n\u2202n\n\u2202t\n= \u2212\u03b1 \u2202\n\u2202x\n{\nn\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n1\u2212 \u03b8\n1 + \u03b3n\n)}\n.(B.1b)\nThis system has the parabolic-type dispersion relation\n\u03bb(k2) = \u2212\u03b2Q1k\n6 \u2212 (P2Q2 \u2212 P1Q1 \u2212Q1)k4 + \u03c1Q1k2\n\u03b2k4 + (P1 + 1)k2 + \u03c1\n;(B.2)\n(refer to (2.2)). Since lim\u03b3\u21920+ Q1(\u03b3) = 0 and lim\u03b3\u21920+ Q2(\u03b3) = \u03b1, we can force the\ndispersion relation to be positive by ensuring that \u03b3 is small enough. It is easy to\nshow that if P2Q2(\u03b3) \u2212 P1Q1(\u03b3) \u2212 Q1(\u03b3) > 0, then the uniform steady state loses\nstability as \u03b3 decreases beyond a critical value \u03b3c, where\n(P2Q2(\u03b3c)\u2212 P1Q1(\u03b3c)\u2212Q1(\u03b3c))2 = 4\u03b2\u03c1Q21(\u03b3c).\nThe corresponding critical wavenumber is\nk2c =\nP2Q2(\u03b3c)\u2212 P1Q1(\u03b3c)\u2212Q1(\u03b3c)\n2\u03b2Q1(\u03b3c)\n.(B.3)\nThe epithelial and dermal cell condensations which form during early chick skin\nmorphogenesis are small; we therefore hypothesize that they occur in the vicinity of\nthe bifurcation point. We shall also assume that there is one and only one wavenumber\nk that has a positive growth rate. Furthermore, we assume that at bifurcation k = kc,\nand that the solutions are periodic in space with period 2\u03c0\/kc.\nENVELOPE METHOD 229\nAs the linear growth rate is small we look, as usual, for solutions that evolve on\nthe slow time scale \u00192t; thus we set\n\u03b3 = \u03b3c \u2212 \u00192, where 0 < \u0019\u0005 1, and T = \u00192t.(B.4)\nWe consider the variables \u03b8 and n as functions of \u0019, x, and T , ignoring the t dependence\nexcept through T in the usual way. We assume power series expansions for \u03b8 and n,\n\u03b8(x, T, \u0019) = \u0019\u03b81(x, T ) + \u0019\n2\u03b82(x, T ) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(B.5a)\nn(x, T, \u0019) = 1 + \u0019n1(x, T ) + \u0019\n2n2(x, T ) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .(B.5b)\nBy substituting (B.4) and (B.5) into (B.1) we reduce the analysis of the nonlinear\nsystem to that of a hierarchy of linear equations by equating coefficients of O(\u0019),\nO(\u00192), and so on.\nTo O(\u0019) we have\nL\n(\n\u03b81\nn1\n)\n= 0,\nwhere\nL \u2261\n(\n\u2212\u03b2 \u22024\u2202x4 + (1 + P1) \u2202\n2\n\u2202x2 \u2212 \u03c1 P2 \u2202\n2\n\u2202x2\nQ2\n\u22022\n\u2202x2 Q1\n\u22022\n\u2202x2\n)\n.\nThus we have (\n\u03b81\nn1\n)\n=\n(\n1\nM\n)\n(A(T ) cos kcx+B(T ) sin kcx) ,\nwith M as in (2.4).\nIn the usual way, A(T ) and B(T ) are determined by suppressing secular terms\nlater. Secular terms appear at O(\u00193), where we have\nL\n(\n\u03b83\nn3\n)\n=\n(\nR1\nR2\n)\n,(B.6)\nwhere R1 and R2 are known functions of \u03b81, \u03b82, n1, and n2 (where \u03b82 and n2 are\ndetermined from the equations at O(\u00192). Secular terms appear in the solutions for\n(\u03b83, n3)\nT . To suppress these secular terms we use the Fredholm alternative (see, for\nexample, Keener (1988)). A solution w = (\u03b83, n3)\nT exists for (B.6) if and only if the\nFredholm alternative is satisfied, that is, the inner product\n\u3008w\u2217,R\u3009 =\n\u222b 2\u03c0\nkc\n0\n(\u03b8\u2217R\u00af1 + n\u2217R\u00af2) dx = 0,\nwhere the bar denotes the complex conjugate and w\u2217 is a bounded solution of the\nadjoint problem\nL\u2217(w\u2217) = 0,\nwhere L\u2217 is the adjoint operator to L.\n230 GERHARD CRUYWAGEN, PHILIP MAINI, AND JAMES MURRAY\nSolving this gives, after much tedious algebra, the Landau equation for the evo-\nlution of the amplitude A2(T ) +B2(T ) on the slow time scale as\n1\n2\nd\n(\nA2 +B2\n)\ndT\n= \u2126\n(\nA2 +B2\n)\n+ \u0393\n(\nA2 +B2\n)2\n,(B.7)\nwhere\n\u2126 =\n\u03b3k2c\n(\u03b3c + 1)3\n> 0\nand \u0393 is a complicated expression of the model parameters (refer to Cruywagen and\nMurray (1992)).\nThe behavior of this equation is summarized in Cruywagen and Murray (1992).\nIf \u0393 < 0 the solution evolves to(\n\u03b8\nn\n)\n=\n(\n0\n1\n)\n+ \u0019 (A cos kcx+B sin kcx) +O(\u0019\n2) as T \u2192\u221e,(B.8)\nwhere A2 +B2 = \u2212\u2126\/\u0393.\nAcknowledgments.
