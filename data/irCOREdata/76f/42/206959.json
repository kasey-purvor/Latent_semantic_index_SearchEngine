Introduction.  \nThe current intensified business competition, rate of technological change, and \nthe pace of globalisation processes are radically transforming organisational life. In \ntrying to address these challenges, organisations are developing new working \npractices that shape and are shaped by the way people relate to each other within and \nacross organisations. Indeed, within the new economy, working practices have \nbecome increasingly \u2018networking practices\u2019 (Wittel, 2001). This focus on networks is \nnot knew\n1, almost a decade ago Castells\u2019 (1996) work already outlined the global \nmacro-society of the information age naming it the \u2018 network society\u2019. In his work, he \ndescribes these networks as open structures able to expand without limits and highly \ndynamic. Networks are \u2018appropriate instruments for a capitalist economy based on \ninnovation, globalisation and decentralised concentration\u2019 and also for a \u2018culture of \nendless deconstruction and reconstruction\u2019 (Castells 1996: 470).   \nIn management, the growth of the social network discipline has been aided by \nthree important developments in the business world (Newel et al. 2002): the \nimportance of the informal structure within the organisation, that coexists with the \nformal structure. Even in the most bureaucratic organisations, individuals have always \ninteracted with each other in a myriad of ways not specific to the organisational chart. \nSecond, the shift in the 20\nth\n century to an organisational model that is flatter, more \nflexible, team oriented and more reliant on knowledge assets. With this shift to more \norganic, network like structures, has come a need to understand how these structures \nwork and how to manage them. And third, the rapid growth in close co-operative \nrelationships across organisational boundaries \u2013outsourcing, joint ventures, alliances, \nmulti-organisational project work etc. Also virtual organising generates a host of new \nmanagement issues about how to manage work in the absence of strict reporting \nrelationships.  \nWhereas the structure of the traditional industrial sectors is represented to a \nlarge extend by physicality and materiality -through products machinery, plants, \ntransport and delivery systems- (Kallinikos 2001); nowadays bureaucratic models of \norganisation still exist, but the different ways of organising emerging are more fluid \nand dynamic than traditional structures (Newel et al. 2002). As Kallinikos (2004:6) \nsays \u201cnetwork [has become the] counter image of organisation to the boundary \nmaintaining, hierarchically structured systems underlying the industrial age.\u201d This \nhelps to explain why \u201cnetwork\u201d has become \u2018the\u2019 conceptual tool to identify flows of \ninformation and resources through formal or informal organizations and institutions, \nparticularly significant in economic and social terms when uncertainty is high.  \n                                                 \n1\n \"Network\" as a concept that has been increasingly used throughout the last two decades in social \nsciences. Moreover, the theoretical study and applications of \"network analysis\" are also the focus of \nan enormous amount of specialized works from Sociology, Anthropology, Economic Theory, etc. \n(Burt, 2000) \n \nThe metaphor of a network has become a very suggestive image of organising \nin an age of high context-crossing electronic transactivity. There are however a \nnumber of problems with the use of the concept in organisational settings (Conway, \nJones and Steward, 2000). The studies focused on organisational networks have an \nexcessive emphasis on the utilitarian and functional value of the network itself. As a \nresult there is very little data gathering in relation to the actors and relationships \nwithin the network and a lack of focus on its dynamics \u2013if anything there is a rather \nexcessive reliance of the \u2018whom to whom\u2019 relationships \u2013 (Burt, 2000; Granovetter, \n1974). In most cases, the network\u2019s structure is supposed to be stable even if the \nmembership of the network changes. Furthermore, the demarcation of the network \nboundaries in\/across organisations is also problematic. It is important therefore to \ndifferentiate between \"network\" and \"organisation\". A \"network\" goes usually way \nbeyond institutions and organizations (either firms, commercial houses, banks or \nhospitals). Furthermore, as Kallinikos (2004) suggests, compared with traditional \nforms of organising and markets: \u2018network\u2019 as used in organisational studies emerges \nas nearly devoid of institutional anchoring and social implications. It is not that clear \nfrom those studies how the concept of a network can challenge, complement or \nreplace traditional organisational forms. \nStudies dealing with the concept of social capital (some quotes like Putnam, ) \nhave tackled some of these problems when it comes to networking as social practice. \nBourdieu (1986) who originated the notion of social capital, has consistently \nanswered the reproduction of more traditional social relations. However, how crucial \nis social capital in the new informational are that involve not the reproduction but \nrather the production of social relations ? The transformations of the system of \neconomic production also alter traditional social structures (Touraine, 1988). The \ndevelopment of this different ways of relating are linked to the development of ICTs, \nto the process of globalisation and individualisation and to the fact that modern \nsociety is society on the move (Lash and Urry, 1994: 252). If we focus then, on the \nprocess of networking as an emergent social practice rather than on the structure or \nmathematical properties of the resulting networks themselves we might begging to \nunderstand why networking, which has always been an important business practice, \nseems to be broadening as a phenomena and acquiring such importance especially \nwhen it comes to create or disseminate knowledge in geographically disperse \norganisations. It is to this area of research that this paper aims to contribute.  \nThe paper is organised as follows. In the following section current research in \norganisational knowledge is briefly reviewed and some its characteristics are \nhighlighted. Section two focuses on the particular role organisational collectives such \nas networks play in processes of organisational knowledge whereas section four \npresents the details of the research methodology and introduces an overview of the \ncase study. This is followed by a description and analysis of the main narrative. The \nfinal section draws some conclusions regarding a networking approach to studying \nknowledge processes in organisations.  \nOrganisational knowledge as participation  \nAny collective engaged in work practices is able to create a space where \nknowledge is generated, maintained and transmitted. And yet, research about \nknowledge in organisational networks is generally limited by normative expectations \non how people \u2018should behave\u2019 to be successful networkers, whereas knowledge \nprocesses are often explored only in relation to their degree of manageability.  \nIndeed, within the organisational literature the idea of managing knowledge \nhas been developed and\/or challenged according to a number of different perspectives \nvery much in line with current debates in social sciences (Brown and Duguid, 2001; \nAlavi and Leidner, 2001; Alvesson and Karreman, 2001; Schultze, 1998). I would \ndistinguish mainly two polar positions: \u2018having\u2019 knowledge and \u2018enabling\u2019 knowledge \n(Smircich, 1983; Cook and Brown, 1999). Whereas in the first perspective knowledge \nis seen as an attribute or possession of the organisation or of its individual members \u2013\n\u2018knowledge workers\u2019- the second perspective looks at knowledge from a more \nsystemic point of view, as a dynamic generative and emergent process. I explore this \ndistinction below. \n     Treating knowledge as an attribute of the organisation takes us back to a functional \nperspective on organisations conceptualising them as machines (Morgan, 1986). \nResearchers following this approach, tend to portray knowledge as part of the \nstructural system of the organisation and therefore attuned to, and supportive of it. \nThey take for granted that the organisation \u2018has\u2019 knowledge and that in exploiting it, it \nwill become the firm\u2019s main source of \u2018competitive advantage\u2019 (Holsapple and Joshi, \n2002). Thus, knowledge is thought as objective, divisible\ni\n, and therefore manageable -\nat least in its explicit form- using technology as the set of tools to codify it (Hansen et \nal. 1999). The social phenomena underlying the generation and sharing of knowledge \nare considered as factual, measurable and delimited and therefore perceived as \nbehaving in a functional or dysfunctional way in terms of achieving the organisation\u2019s \nsurvival. \nThis has consequences for the way knowledge is treated and explored. It is \nimplied that an ineffective organisation can be made effective and enhance its profit \nmargin if an \u2018unhealthy\u2019 knowledge system can be supplanted by a \u2018healthy\u2019 one \n(Thomas et al. 2001). Following this approach organizations have attempted to find a \nway through which they can make the knowledge emanating from the individual's \npersonal experiences part of the organization\u2019s knowledge databases in order to \nenhance the firm\u2019s \u2018competitive advantage\u2019. However if knowledge is an \u201cambiguous, \nunspecific and dynamic phenomenon, intrinsically related to meaning, understanding \nand process and thus difficult to manage\u201d (Alvesson and Karreman, 2001) it would \nmake more sense to think in terms of facilitating knowledge transfer and re-\nproduction rather than in managing it (Tsoukas, 1996).  \nUnderstanding organizational knowledge as an object or resource tends to \nprivilege explicit over tacit knowledge, and knowledge possessed by individuals over \nthat possessed by the group (Cook and Brown, 1999). However, what we \u2018know\u2019 and \nthe way we practise it emerges from the interplay between tacit and explicit \nknowledge -it is inter-subjective-, and is therefore inherently indeterminate and \ncontinually emerging (Tsoukas, 1996). Furthermore knowledge needs also a language \nto be transmitted, represented and shared and as such is always historically and \nculturally specific. The knowledge -and therefore the sense of \u2018reality\u2019- that is shared \nby particular social groups, is sustained by social processes.  \nFrom this perspective individual experiences are not considered in isolation, \nsince knowledge is the product of interaction and communication (Tsoukas and \nVladimirou, 2001). Indeed, for experiences and explanations to be thought of as \nrelevant knowledge, they have to be experienced as meaningful by the social \ncollective. Thus, it is social groups that determine what is \u2018memorable\u2019 and also how \nit will be practised. It is to this idea of \u2018knowledge-as-participation\u2019 (Brown, 2002, in \nBouwen and Craps, 2004) that I want to draw attention to in this paper.  \nThis perspective takes a conceptual shift away from the individual towards the \ngroup, from possessions towards processes, and the focus is on interactions and social \npractices. Considering the sharing of knowledge in social collectives as relational \nimplies to focus our attention on the conversations and joint practices that the network \nmembers constantly engage in. Since organisational practices cannot operate outside \nthe cultural or discursive level and depend upon meaning for their effective operation, \n\u201cit is apparent that they can and should be seen as discursive practices.\u201d (du Gay \n2000: 166).  \nOrganisational collectives seen in discursive terms have been described as \neither \u2018monologues or dialogues\u2019 (Keenoy et al 1997: 149). The former indicates an \norganisation represented as one story told mainly by a dominant group that interprets \nthe exchanges among its members as a coherent whole producing a singular narrative \n(Boje 1994). In contrast a \u2018dialogical\u2019 analysis recognises the different interpretations \nof any given organisational story and treats them as co-existing discourses that might \noverlap at some point throughout their interpretation of the reality of the organisation. \nThis type of analysis stresses the constant negotiation of differences that is enacted \nthrough socially constructed practices. The organisational collective, can then be seen \nas through an unfolding conversation. \nAmong organisational collectives dialogues imply tension, and articulation of \nmeanings through the centripetal forces seeking expression in unity, merging and \nmonologue and the centrifugal forces seeking expression in multiplicity, separating, \ndisagreement and dialogue. The centripetal forces pushing towards unity and order \naccount for the dominance of particular narratives whereas the centrifugal forces of \nmultiplicity and diversity seek to be given more room to be expressed within that \nnarrative. Hence, through everyday conversational activity people aim to organise \ntheir collective experiences but are also able to generate new strategies and innovate.  \nPlacing actions and social practices at the centre of attention means also that \nneither individuals nor systems are allowed to predominate but that the analysis can \nconcentrate on the actions and manifest organisational practices displayed in the \ninteraction between both (Wenger, 2000; Brown and Duguid, 2001). The \norganisation\u2019s advantage would then be more related to efforts of co-ordination and \nenabling \u2013rather than managing\u2013 the knowledge processes occurring among different \ncollectives within and around the organisation  (Brown and Duguid, 2001; Newell et \nal., 2001). \nFrom networks to networking as a social practice  \nMost of the studies of knowledge explored before follow what Morgan would \ncall the machine metaphor for understanding organisations (Morgan, 1986). It is the \nmost common metaphor in organisational literature and although it has been criticised \nand recognized as unsatisfactory in a rapidly changing world; it has nonetheless \ncontinued to inform the practice of management. The image of an organisation as a \nmachine relies on the deployment of prescribed rules and formalised control intended \nto simplify the operations of the organisation to achieve predictability even in \nconditions of uncertainty and change. That is why the metaphor continues to be very \nattractive, since it seems to offer simplification, routine and predictability as well as \nrationality as the means to understand the process of organising and also the \ninterchange of knowledge. Even if there is an agreement about the complex world that \nis the business world these days and about its constantly changing environment, this \nmetaphor still dominates the way we think and act in relation to organisations \n(Morgan, 1986). In a sense formal organisation emerges as a way of \u2018managing and \nreducing\u2019 its complexity.    \n     However, organisations are inherently complex.  From a knowledge point of view, \nthis perspective  on  organisations emphasises how connections among members of a \nnetwork can enable learning and development (Griffin et al. 1998; Kallinikos, 1998; \nAnderson, 1999; Kauffmann, 2000). As a system organisations are able to gather data \nabout their surroundings, themselves and their behaviour and then use that \ninformation for guiding future actions (Kauffman, 2000). However, the connections \nestablished among different parts of the network allow not only for information \ntransmission among collectives but also open up possibilities of generating and \nsharing new meanings, thus providing increased capability to share and generate \nknowledge. If we think in terms of organisational collectives and their working \nrelationships this also means that people are able to organise themselves and the \nknowledge they share by relying in their web of connections when they need to search \nand acquire new information or reorganise their activities. The benefit of this \nperspective is the conceptualisation of the organisation as a structure that is fluid, yet \nsensitive to the needs of the connected elements as well as in connection with its \nenvironment in such a way that co-evolution \u2013of both the organisation and its \nenvironment- is possible (Griffin et al., 1998).  \n     Indeed, most contemporary organisations are networks of interdependent units, \nusing \u2018groups\u2019 and work teams as their \u2018building blocks\u2019. For that reason relationships \namong the different components of the organisation \u2013individuals or groups- are \ncomplex being characterised by a mixture of co-operation and competition. People \ncompete against each other for power and scarce resources but, in the meantime they \nneed to rely on each other in order to accomplish their tasks, while emotional ties are \nformed among them (Masterbroek, 1987). Owing to the necessary interdependency \namong organisational units, the process of organising needs to take place through the \nfine balancing of co-operation and mutual dependency on the one hand, and rivalry \nand autonomy on the other hand. This is reflected in the need that work teams \nexperience to create a common framework of working routines and habits in order for \npeople to work together and at the same time to capitalise on and encourage \ndifference and variety \u2013e.g. specific expertise- that would allow for both innovation \nand creativity within the team and the wider organisation.  \n     However, most of the research work done in relation to networks still revolves \naround the idea of increasing the network\u2019s \u2013and eventually the organisation\u2019s- \nperformance (Burt, 2000 \u2013books on networking). In fact, despite the importance given \nto networking in the organisational literature there are few studies which aim to look \nat networking per se \u2013looking at practices and processes- and even less tracking the \nsocial processes involved (Hosking and Morley, 1991).  \nThe exception to this rule are the studies dealing with social capital with their \nemphasis on community and interactions among the members of a community that \nuse their networks as capital, as social capital \u2013brief explanation and summary- And \nyet these studies do not explain why relationships have become more fragmented. \nAndreas Wittel (2001) introduced the concept of network sociality as a contrast to the \nterm community. Community he argues entails \u2018stability, coherence, embeddednes \nand belonging\u2019 (pg. 51). Any community involves strong ties, proximity and a \ncommon history or narrative of the collective. Network sociality on the other hand, \ndoes not represent belonging but rather the processes of integration and disintegration. \nIt is a disembeded subjectivity that is somehow lifted out of a specific geographical \ncontext. It is the social expression of what Bauman calls the \u2018liquid modernity\u2019. In this \nsociality relationships are not \u2018narrational\u2019 but informational, not based on mutual \nexperience or a shared common history but primarily on a exchange of data or on \n\u2018catching up\u2019. Narratives are characterised by duration, whereas information here is \ndefined by ephemerality. This is what Sennet (1998) calls the erosion of enduring \nrelationships in the world of work.  \nThe social relationships among the members of working networks, -especially \nin geographically disperse organsiations- are fleeting and transient yet iterative. The \nsocial bond at work is not bureaucratic but rather informational, since it is generally \ncreated on a  project-by-project basis by the movement of ideas, the establishment of \nonly ever temporary standards and protocols, the creation and protection of \nproprietary information. It is constructed on the grounds of communication and \ntransport technology. Network sociality in this respect emerges alongside and \nsometimes displaces the idea of a community.  \nWithin organisations, we see a replacement of linear time by serial time that \nleads to loss of trust between working colleagues, loss of commitment towards the \ntask in hand, and generally of loyalty towards the organisation. Skills become portable \nand experience loses value. Projects are short term, short contracts, flexible tasks and \nincreasing staff turn over make it difficult for employees to develop a common \nnarrative anymore (Sennet, 1998). Detachment with the organisation and the project \nat hand is required, not involvement.   \nThere is a constant individualisation of work that presumes a removal from \nhistorically prescribed social forms and commitments, a loss of traditional security \nwith respect to rituals, guiding norms and practical knowledge (Beck, 1999). Instead \nindividuals must actively construct social bonds. Schulze describes a change from \npre-given relationships to choice. This choice in relations is defined by a higher \ndegree of mobility, by translocal communications, by a high a mount of social \ncontacts, and by a subjective management of the networks. Tourane (1988) talked \nabout how identity depends increasingly on an awareness of the relationships with \nothers. People are lifted out of their contexts and reinserted in largely disembeded \nsocial relations, which they must at the same time continually construct, sociality is at \nthe same time distantiated and immediate. \nKnowledge workers tend to be nomadic in their personal biography and their \nnon-linear work biographies. Freelancers, more and more people work with and for \nfirms but not for firms. Paradigmatic for the work situation, freelancers suffer from \nchronic network construction and maintenance, they are the most fully reliant on their \nown resources of social capital. There is an active construction and reconstruction of a \nsocial network. One has to constantly renew, refresh and revaluate the existing \ncontacts. They cannot be taken for granted anymore. \nNetwork sociality is a technological sociality insofar as it is deeply embedded \nin communication technology, transport technology and technologies to manage \nrelationships. Transportation and ICTs provide the infrastructure for people and \nsocieties on the move. A community oriented sociality does not rely so much on that \ntype of technology. Network sociality is de-localised, it is a sociality on the move, a \nsociality over distance. In the contemporary workplace the idea of uninterrupted face-\nto-face sociality, disentangled from technological devices is becoming a myth. We are \nexperiencing an integration of long-distance communication in our realm of face-to-\nface interaction. It clearly indicates a process towards an integration of \ntechnologically mediated communication into our routines of face-to-face \ninteraction\nii\n.  \nInformation according to Lash (2002) is compressed in time and space. It \ntakes no claim to universality but is contained in the immediacy of the particular. \nInformation shrinks or compresses metanarratives to a mere point, a signal, a mere \nevent in time. Network sociality mirrors this distinction between the narrative and \ninformation on a micro-sociological level. Network sociality is not rooted on a shared \nhistory. Loss of a shared biography, subjects cannot rely on a common narrative on a \nshared experience. Mobility and speed seem to be the primary reasons for this shift \nfrom a narrative to an informational sociality. Mobility is important because more and \nmore people are on the move and thus somewhere else. In order to re-establish social \ncontacts, catching-up becomes indispensable condition in social situations. Narratives \nare time consuming: information is quick. E.g. half hour business meeting especially \nover the telephone they have to be focused, exchange information, not stories, \ndiscourse or narratives. \nRelationships are increasingly organised in terms of short term projects. As \nsoon as a new project begins, talk becomes very intense, information moves to and for \nvery quickly at the same time as its wider circulation is tightly guarded.  For the \nduration of the project people work long hours and give the project priority. When the \nproject terminates these collaborations are kept on a low flame and new projects \ncooperations and social ties are established or reestablished. Ephemeral but intense, \nfocused, fast and overloaded social ties is also observable in nonwork situations  -\nspeeddating- . \nAccording to Wittel (2001) there is an increasing perception of social \nrelationships as social capital. There is also a move from having relationships to doing \nand managing relationships. This way of relation implies social bonds that are being \ncontinuously produced, reproduced and consumed. \nHoward Rheingold (1994) talked about the need for rebuilding community in \nthe face of American\u2019s loss of a sense of community. ICTs according to him gives us \nthe chance of revitalise communities. What has been lost because of mobility and a \ngrowing relevance of consumption can now be reconstructed with a little help from \nthe monitor and the keyboard, a monitor, a process and a modem. His aim was to \nrevitalise the public sphere and built new forms of community. However, this techno-\ndeterministic perspective does not interlink cultural and technological change. The \nassumption that a cultural process \u2013disentanglement from communities can be \nreversed with technology is relatively na\u00efve. The use of the term community in \nrelation to electronic communications is at least problematic and confusing. \nCommunities share a common geographical territory, a common history, a common \nvalue system, and they are rooted in a  common religion.  Online communities \nhowever draw on the idea of the imaginary communities the Anderson talked about. \nThe term virtual suggest a doubling of reality and it is not. On line and off line worlds \nare not separated they form part of the same reality. It suggests a reality that is not \nmediated. All on line experiences are very real experiences for people doing them. \nThe main difference between on line and off line communication lacks a common and \nmutual perception of the context. Online sociality cannot rely on exogenous o \ncontextual forms of structuration. Thus any structuration of sociality has to be \nproduced internally by the participants.  \nAs a contrast Sennet (1998) is perhaps the best known commentator on the \nerosion of enduring relationships. His question is show people can generate meaning \nand identity under conditions of increasing flexibility and risk? Maintain trusting and \nlong lasting relationships and a permanent narrative in the work environment that \nworships change and condemns routine?  \nFlexibility is one of the characteristics of this short-term economy. Produces \ntolerance of fragmentation and generates lack of attachment. Networking seems to \nbecome more important than the ability to stick to a problem and resolve it. Flexibility \nalso affects the loyalty to the company. And it affects also skills and experience. \nSkills become portable and experience loses value. The ability to focus quickly in \nnews tasks counts more than accumulated experience. Change becomes a value in \nitself and resistance towards change is taken as a sign of failure. Short term projects, \ncontrast, flexible tasks and increasing staff turn over make it difficult for employees to \ndevelop a common narrative anymore. Detachment is required, not involvement. A \ngood team player should have the ability to stand back from established relationships. \nThis is the contrast to the utopian version of the online communities (Knorr-Cetina, \n2000). Both communities and organisations are social systems with clear boundaries \nwith a highly defined inside and outside. Networks however are open social systems.  \n \n  \nRecent perspectives that have focused on the role of the organisational network in the \ngeneration and use of knowledge follow this approach when they suggest that \nalthough the integration of individual knowledge at the collective level is necessary, \nthe knowledge is \u2018owned\u2019 nevertheless at the individual level (Okhuysen and \nEisenhardt, 2002). \n      It is through the connection between the members of a network and their \ninterchanges that stories, experiences and knowledge, are developed, maintained, \ninterrupted and transformed. The way the communications flow among the members \nof a working network becomes crucial to develop new ways of organising and is the \nway in which knowledge is generated and shared among them. Organisational \ncollectives therefore play a central role in the \u2018knowledge-creating company\u2019 (Nonaka \nand Takeuchi, 1995) because they provide a shared context where individuals can \ninteract with each other and engage in the constant conversations on which effective \nreflection depends. If we take this view, we will be able to stress the interactive and \nco-evolving- nature of organisations with their environments as well as the process of \nco-emergence of both knowledge and organised structure through the \u201cconnection, \ninteraction, [and] relationships between diverse entities\u201d in the organisation (Allen, \n2001).  \nMethodology  \n  \nIn this paper we consider knowledge as a social construction that is mainly \nconstituted through dialogue, conflicting interpretations and action possibilities \nnegotiated among the members of a collective. We have therefore used a research \nmethodology that allows us to focus upon the shared social context of the parties \ninvolved in those knowledge processes. The research described in this paper has \nfollowed a qualitative approach to data gathering and analysis. This approach implies \nessentially an emphasis on processes and meanings rather than on an examination or \nmeasurement in terms of quantity, amount, intensity or frequency (Van Maanen, \n1982). \n      The particular Corporation where this study took place is a multinational \nbusiness made up of more than 1800 individual companies with branches all over the \nworld. It is a well known \u2018traditional organisation\u2019 with mainly two lines of \u2018core \nproducts\u2019. However, two years ago, the Corporation put in place plans for leveraging \nits brand name and encouraging internal development.  It set up a new internet \nbusiness (NIB) in order to create new ventures in a non-traditional medium using \u201cthe \ninternet as a way to look at new ways of doing business and creating new \nrelationships, particularly online relationships with the customers\u2026 looking at ways \nwe can do more with the brand, the customer contact and the actual points of sale.\u201d \nThe business venture we have looked at more closely -as an example of the type of \nventures developed by NIB- had participants in two continents and three different \nlocations: London in the UK and Bombay and Delhi in India. The team observed was \ninvolved in the planning and implementation of an e-learning project with six schools \nin India.  \nAs means of data gathering, we have conducted 10 semi-structured interviews \nwith a cross-section of NIB members, together with a \u2018reflecting back\u2019 workshop. \nEach interview lasted at least 1 and \u00bd hour. The first author also attended 4 \nteleconferences with the India venture team. These were \u2018virtual observations\u2019 of  the \nventure team weekly meetings \u2013via teleconference-. All interviews and group \ndiscussions were taped and transcribed verbatim. The use of different methods of data \ngathering corresponds with the attempt to use different viewpoints to gain a greater \nunderstanding of the phenomena being studied adding rigor, breadth and depth to our \ninvestigation (Flick, 1992). The different methods can also facilitate and legitimate the \ndiverse chorus of voices, interests and perspectives that exist within an organisation. \nThus, using an interpretative approach and different methods of data gathering implies \nalso looking into the multiple narratives that give voice to, and allow the construction \nof multiple organisational worlds (Alvesson, 1995). \nIn the following section, we present the analysis of the data from which the \nemployees\u2019 stories have been extracted. Those stories were gathered through the in-\ndepth interviews, group discussions and the meetings with employees of NIB. They \nare one of the main forms of discourse through which organisational members share \nand transmit their experiences and therefore their knowledge. The analysis of those \nstories sought to identify the work processes the team from NIB engaged in while \nworking on the development and implementation of ventures like the school e-\nlearning project in India. The analysis consisted of multiple readings of the meeting \nand interview transcripts and documentation for the systematic identification of ways \nof  relating, work processes and events. These were initially coded according to three \nmain areas: i) the connections and communication processes \u2013including enabling and \ninhibiting conditions- between NIB and the large corporation, ii) between the India \nventure team and NIB and iii) within the India venture team. The coding was \nachieved with the aid of Atlas\/Ti, a qualitative research software for data analysis and \nmanagement (Murh, 1997).  \nThe next section aims to reconstruct the history and main concerns of NIB\u2019s \nemployees according to those stories. The end result is an \u2018added story\u2019 that results \nfrom our analysis and seeks to \u2018make more complex\u2019 the reader\u2019s understanding of \nthe stories employees have been telling to each other and to us during the research \nprocess. The aim of this account is to make clearer how those stories, and therefore \nexperiences and knowledge, are (re) produced through the employees\u2019 interactions.  \nNetworking constraints \nNIB and the Corporation: Developing a two way relationship \nThe idea that new business prosper when separated from their corporate parents \nhas become commonplace (Kluge et al., 2001). Separation is the model of choice \nespecially when the old and the new differ greatly -for example the internet start up \nlaunched by an industrial company. But although the new businesses need space to \ndevelop, separation can prevent them from obtaining invaluable knowledge, \nexperience and resources as well as rob the parent company from the vitality and new \npractices the new business can generate (Day, Mang, Ritcher, & Roberts, 2001).  That \nwas a tension experienced in the way of relating between NIB and the Corporation \nfrom the very beginning. NIB\u2019s main objective was to \u2018make money out of the \ninternet\u2019 establishing their own niche while providing  value back to the Corporation. \n \n\u201cWe have, on the one hand, a corporate role which is that we need to relate back into the \nCorporation, given they are funding us and we're part of them.  We need to have a rapport and \ncredibility there but at the same time we may need to have some attributes for the market place \nwhich are slightly different.\u201d (Interview 2) \n \nBeing a new medium, the set of skills and capabilities the employees working at \nNIB needed were different from those required by the more traditional businesses \nwithin Corporation. That is why NIB started to look for people with \u2018the right set of \ncapabilities\u2019 to compete and \u2018open up\u2019 new markets. People from outside the \nCorporation with the required skills where recruited. That soon created a perception \nof difference between the new employees in terms of origins: people coming from \noutside the company and people being promoted from within the Corporation .  \n \n\u201cI think, it's a good thing to have these specialists from outside and they bring a new \nperspective of what we're trying to do, because here we're trying to move into new businesses \nand I think they will help at least provide some input and insight as to what should be the \nbenchmarks and having that benchmark of what we're trying to do in the new environment will \nmaybe help transform some of [the Corporation\u2019s] processes and adapt them to be more \neffective and efficient. But equally from the [Corporation\u2019s] side they need to understand that \nwe're moving into a new environment and you need those people...\u201d (Interview 8) \n \nAt the same time, this recruiting of new people -some of them to very senior \npositions- meant usually reorganisation of roles and responsibilities. One of the \nproblems associated with this reorganising of people and functions was the lack of \ntime to distribute the necessary information for people to know \u201cwho does what, \nwhere and in what role\u201d.  \n \n\u201c\u2026restructuring that takes place every six months. So, your reference indicator changes and \nyou get constantly mapped into different parts of the organisation and even though, what you do \nevery day doesn't change, you just haven't got a clue who's doing what, who's roles and \nresponsibility, what its direction.\u201d (Interview 6) \n \nThis lack of clarity was also echoed on they way people defined themselves: as \nemployees of the Corporation or employees of NIB? This identification was important \nwhen it came to plan a career. Could they develop their career across the Corporation \ncrossing over the specialisation that some of the jobs at NIB implied or were they \nemployed to be NIB employees exclusively? This had practical consequences on the \nway the company hired its people creating temporary contracts when it came to fulfil \nsome jobs or permanent contracts for some others.   \n \n\u201cPeople who've transferred from [the Corporation] into NIB often regard this as a post within \ntheir greater career within [the Corporation]. So they regard themselves as perhaps a \nCorporation\u2019s employee first and they're very interested in knowing what is my status within the \nwider organisation, when is my promotion going to happen, when can I apply for my next \nposition within [the Corporation]? People who come from outside might regard it as an internet \nbusiness and see this as a step on their career in an internet world.\u201d (Interview 6) \n \nAccording to Day et al. (2001) a company that seeks both performance and \ngrowth should give entrepreneurial activities plenty of space but also connect them to \nits parents\u2019 resources, goals and knowledge. However some of the characteristics of \nboth the Corporation and the new business were inhibiting this \u2018linking back\u2019 process.  \nFor instance, the different ways of working and cultures necessary to carry on a new \njob: \n \n\u201c\u2026the Corporation culture is, in some ways, a barrier to our culture\u201d (Interview 2) \n \n\u201cwe have a set of very [Corporate] industry\u2026specific processes and they do not necessarily \napply to very fast pace, internet venture set up and I'm experiencing problems in trying to move \nthings forward and yet I've felt I'm being held back by these very heavyweight processes, which \ndon't necessarily fit for a typical venture set up environment.\u201d (Interview 2) \n \nAn enabler and inhibitor for NIB\u2019s development was the way the Corporation is \nrun: through informal networks. People tend to know each other and there seems to be \nlittle need for a formal organisational chart. The assumption is that everyone is or \nshould be part of a network to be able to communicate and to do a good job. As many \nother enterprises, the Corporation organises itself around \u2018projects\u2019 coordinated \nthrough those networks that have at their core a \u2018networking logic\u2019 not only \ntechnological but also social. \n \n\u201cIf you come in from the outside, it's very clear that people are still knit here very \ntightly on personal relationships, based on when they started as new graduates, where \nthey got moved around the world, where they had jobs and they know each other\u2026 It's \na very tightly knit culture and it's because of those relationships that things actually get \ncommunicated and work done.\u201d (Interview 5) \n \nSocial networks have always allowed us to create relational spaces in which \nknowledge is shared, disseminated and interchanged. The Corporation is very much \nbased on those networks, they can help create and promote new ways of working \nwithout having to go through very formalised procedures. However \u2018traditional \nnetworking\u2019 presents us with the impossibility of mastering resources or focussing on \ntask implementation beyond a certain level of complexity  (Castells, 2001). Thus, \ntraditional face-to-face networking only allows us to keep relatively small functioning \nnetworks, whereas the new ICTs allow us to expand on that process and probably \nshape it differently. As we will see latter on this is specially the case in creating new \nventures in far away places like India. However, networks also imply certain degree \nof continuity within the organisation and that is why newcomers have problems \nhaving access to and using a previously established network: \n \n\u201cSo that [the Corporation] people can provide the stronger bridges back into the networks that \nexist within a corporation this size and that the language of [the Corporation] is one that has to \nbe decoded by new people, and you decode the words, you don't necessarily have the ability to \nunderstand the way the networks run that are using that code.\u201d (Interview 2) \n \nWhen connections and boundaries are blurred, a problem emerges on how to \ncommunicate and with whom one communicates, between needing to consult every \ndecision or taking responsibility and between leadership and accountability. In a \ncontext where both life and work are intrinsically insecure and risk taking has become \na necessity, networks provide support (Kelly, 1999). Thus networking might help to \nreduce risk and generate security. It is assumed that the bigger the networks are the \nbetter for everyone that participates in them. On the other hand, a heavy reliance on \nnetworks can become a burden for expansion and development. The tension is \nexposed clearly in the next quotation: \n \n\u201c My belief about a consensus system is that it slows things down as a function. You can then \nargue about whether it speeds it up in the background or not, whether or not you can bring \npeople online. I've never been in a culture where so many people feel like they need to be \nconsulted and they want to argue and you say, so what's your alternative and then they go, oh \nactually, now that you mention it, it's pretty good.\u201d (Interview 5) \n \nThe tendency to work mainly through informal networks means also that there \nis not a \u201cgood knowledge management process\u201d in place that people can follow: \n\u201cwe do not have a very good knowledge management process at this point, within any part of \nthe organisation, let alone between the business creation part. So, how do they share that with \nus? And how do they share that with the bigger Corporate which sits above us as always, in \neverything we do which is to the benefit of.\u201d (Interview 4) \n \nIt is clear through the stories that employees tell that the Corporation has an \norganizational structure, culture and a way of doing things that prompts people to \nstick with the known even when they decide to explore new areas. It therefore made \nsense to place new and old businesses as separated as possible. The idea was that each \nventure, including NIB, could operate under its own resource allocation criteria, \nperformance measurement systems and reward structures. The aim was to increase the \ndistance between legacy business and the new opportunities through the carving out \nof different legally separate units. Anderson (1999) suggests that the most effective \norganisations evolve strategies that lie at the \u2018edge of chaos\u2019. Thus, when \norganisations maintain a balance between equilibrium and flexibility and allow for \nmany small changes that might cumulate into radical strategic innovations allowing \nthem to reach higher fitness levels -or better competence- to co-exist in their \nenvironment. NIB seems to have been an \u2018exploration\u2019 in the search for new markets \nfor the Corporation. However, it was \u2018an exploration\u2019 that was failing not having had \nthe space where both new knowledge and a new organisational structure could \ndevelop.  \n \n\u201cAre we a centre of excellence that helps to bring value to the group by helping them exploit the \ninternet, to improve their business process and generate more value or is our key focus \ndeveloping new internet business, in terms of revenue for the group. So these two don't \nnecessarily align with each other. Sometimes bringing value to a group doesn't necessarily \ngenerate revenue. It could be cost saving for the group and I find, in some ways, these are in \nconflict, the business objectives here.\u201d (Interview 3) \n \n\u201cThe existing projects are making no money. So, while they're all wonderful growth platforms \nand they have all the nice buzz words, at the end of the day we are a taker of cash in [the \nCorporation] and there is, I think, no path to profitability.\u201d (Interview 5) \n NIB and the India e-learning team: Ventures Expanding and Linking back \nAnd yet when the corporation created NIB, its intention was to extend the \nbrand and leverage on its name through the development of new ventures. The ideal \nfor NIB was to be a different but not separate \u2018entity\u2019 from the main Corporation. \nWithin NIB, ventures were also seen as needing their own space to develop. \nThe perception was that without their own resources, their own performance metrics \nand a distinctive organisational design, they would fail to develop the necessary \nentrepreneurial spirit. Also the aim was to benefit from the substantial business \nopportunities that can arise when people develop and interchange ideas, information \nand experiences beyond and across organisational boundaries. In order to achieve this, \nhowever businesses need a number of overlapping channels that effectively transmit \nsoft information and make \u2018remote people\u2019 part of the local working spheres (Day et \nal., 2001). One of the main concerns at NIB in creating ventures that needed a \ndistributed team was the \u2018remote people management\u2019 and the type of communication \nstrategies that needed to be developed.  \n \n\u201cWe have people in London, India, Australia, Argentina, Houston and we have like one person \nin the Netherlands, one or two people in Germany, one or two people in Finland and I'm \nconcerned that we're not managing, we've not matched the remote management of our teams \nand that concerns me in terms of their commitment, their engagement, our on the ground \nunderstanding of what's happening there, what's happening with those businesses,  what do they \nreally think as opposed to what the executives in those countries may think\u201d (Interview 4) \n \nThis concern is also reflected in the difficulty that isolated new businesses \nmight have of rejoining the main mainstream, especially when they have developed \nnew business models that are supposed to invigorate the operations they left behind. It \nwas reproduced in the relationship between NIB and the venture we have looked at \nclosely: the India e-learning team. \nThe India e-learning team had participants in two continents and three different \nlocations: London, UK and Bombay and Delhi in India. The team we observed was \ninvolved in the planning and implementation of an e-learning project with six schools \nin India. In this venture NIB was trying to provide curriculum and non-curriculum \ncontent to schools in India online. Some other companies had attempted to do so in \nIndia before and they had not been successful. NIB concluded that those competitors \nfailed because everything else that was necessary to bring that content to the schools \nand the children wasn't there. The schools needed teacher training, software, \nhardware, technical support, connectivity, infrastructure etc. and all that had to be \nready for them as well. That was the main objective of the NIB India venture and \nprovided an excellent link back to the Corporation.  \n \n\u201cWe want to be able to actually establish relationships with the consumer, ahead of the other \nbusiness in the Corporation\u2026 and we think that, you know, e-learning is a good way of doing \nthat and also the Corporation has always been involved in education, but from more of the \nsocio-investment side. So we also have some in-house expertise in terms of corporate e-learning \nand want to see if we can capitalise on the technology itself and our experience and to see how \nwe can establish something in that domain.\u201d (Interview 7) \n \nHowever, the London manager of the India e-learning venture wanted the \nventure \u2018protected\u2019 from the political fights occurring at the HQ in London. Although \nkeeping parts of the company separated might have helped to achieve the goals of \ngrowth, performance and the development of new ways of thinking, it did present a \nnumber of problems. The problems were associated primarily with the creation of \nnew organizational boundaries between the India team and London. It also inhibited \nthe flow of information and ideas between the two and thereby made it more likely \nthat experiences and knowledge might be lost.  \n \n\u201cIt is very, very important that everybody in the team knows the company, knows the people \nworking for the company, the network and the systems to relate back. Okay, like for example, in \nmy case, I didn't know anything about the Corporation. There were very many times that I \ncouldn't really take decisions because I was like, am I going to get myself into political \nproblems? Is there a structure that I should respect and I'm not doing it?  So, luckily enough, \nmy other two co-workers over there, they had been like forever with the company and they were \nable to direct me, but that really slowed me quite a lot.  So had I known a bit more what the \nstructure was, how did people react, what I could expect from the network, things would have \nbeen faster and easier.\u201d (Interview 11) \n \nThe issue of identity and of how to relate to the different stakeholders involved \nbecame especially poignant within the venture. For instance among the India e-\nlearning team recruited in Bombay and Delhi, people had doubts in terms of \ncommitment of the Corporation to the project or to the possibility of still belonging to \nthe Corporation if the project for which they were hired failed. In relation to this \nproject the main question for its members was: is the Corporation going to absorb the \npeople they are hiring for the India project if it fails or is it going to fire them? \n \n\u201cSo, it's about trying to be absolutely clear what it is like to be part of this organisation, \nparticularly in terms of some of the\u2026 let's say, the chaos and uncertainty. So you can be putting \nall of your energy into a project and then the project gets stopped, simply because it isn't proven \nto create enough value or it's decided something else. So that can be quite distressing if it's \nsomething that you've been involved with.\u201d (Interview 7) \n \nWithin the venture:  Organizational boundaries and flows of information   \nThe employees describe the Indian venture as a very ambitious project that had \nto cope with all the problems of being developed in a remote location. Initially the \nproject had a \u2018venture manager\u2019 that was basically trying to coordinate everything, a \nmarketing specialist and a CTO (Chief Technology Officer).  Later on it became \nobvious to the team that they needed a \u2018good and straight project manager\u2019 as well as \na Launch Director to coordinate back to the Corporation.  Once the \u2018structural\u2019 \nfunctions were covered the team turned their attention to the content. They hired a \nContent Manager with two people working for her, a science and a maths specialist \nand expand on the area of marketing business development hiring a business \ndeveloper and incorporating a Finance Manager. The venture manager in India is the  \n\u2018top guy in the picture\u2019 together  with the Launch Director: \n \n\u201c\u2026because even though there is a local team that is able to keep going, there always has to be \na linkage with the central and that is what [the launch director is] doing at the moment.\u201d \n(Interview 11) \n \nInitially everything was created in Bombay just because part of the team were \nfrom there and because allegedly Bombay \u2018is the new media capital of India\u2019.  As it \nhappened when they started both partnering and selecting the members for the local \nteam, they found that everything \u2018was happening in Delhi\u2019.   \n \n\u201cOur portal development agency, some of the hosting agencies and all the good candidates we \nwere getting, everything was from Delhi.  So that's why, at the moment, we have to have both \noffices going on so [people]  just travel to Delhi every week which is super tough for them.  So \nthere is even a virtual team between the virtual team\u2026\u201d (Interview 10) \n \nIndeed, the distributed teams became part of what an NIB venture meant. This is \nnot unusual since distributed teams are becoming increasingly common especially in \nmultinational organisations. Just as technology facilitated information transmission \naround the world, it now enables globally distributed people to collaborate on issues \nand challenges that their organisation face at the international level (Maznevski and \nChudoba, 2000). However, in this study we were looking at a team characterised \namong other things by using technology supported communication more than face-to-\nface communication and living and working in different countries\niii\n.   \nVirtuality is used here in connection with \u201cthe creation of electronic ties and the \nestablishment of electronically sustained alliances of actors: i.e. networks, which are \noccasioned by the diffusion of current technology\u201d (Kallinikos, 2001: 113). A virtual \nenvironment can have advantages and disadvantages in relation to formal and \ninformal work networks. For instance virtual work can help to eliminate overheads \nand contribute to cost saving creating also greater autonomy for employees (Robey et \nal. 2003). On the other hand when teams are organised virtually they can become \nisolated from the core of the company, experience fears of negative impact in career \ndevelopment, employee exploitation and the physical problems of virtual \ncommunication. The following section presents some of the challenges that the India \nteam faced.  \nMaking the remote team part of the local working spheres \nUnder conditions of virtuality how is it possible to make the communication \nand interchange routines part of the current working spheres ? Work is continuous and \ncomplex and people move fluidly from one task to the next. One of the problems with \ndistributed teams is that the end of meetings often signal \u2018out of sight, out of mind\u2019 \nmaking the \u2018remote\u2019 not part of the continuity of each other\u2019s working spheres (Mark, \n1999). Within these ephemeral conditions,  relationships are rarely based on \nbelonging but rather on processes of \u2018integration and disintegration\u2019. Relationships \nbecome informational than \u2018narrational\u2019 (Sennet, 1998). Thus, not based on mutual \nexperience or common history but primarily on a  exchange of data \u2013 \u2018catching up\u2019.  \nThe issue was how to develop the relationship within the team. \n\u201c\u2026So there are a number of factors that help to influence a virtual team working and the \ncreation of identity is critical.  It's actually more critical in a virtual team than in a co-located \nteam.  People you bump into at the coffee machine every hour or so, you're bound to actually \nrelate to in a very different way to people that you may speak to once every two or three days \nand can't see the expression on the face\u2026\u201d (Meeting 1) \n \nThe challenge then is to find a continuous way of \u2018being in touch\u2019 not only \nthrough weekly or bimonthly formal meetings, with occasional telephone or e-mail \ninterchanges in between, but rather becoming \u2018part of\u2019 the team -even if remote- and \ntherefore of the daily working life. This way of working also makes the development \nof social ties more difficult.  For the India team it meant building a shared repository \nof common team materials and engaging in informal as well as formal \ncommunications, to build relationships outside of the formal meeting structure (Mark, \n1999). However, in the India case the relationships developed between the team and \nthe London\u2019s headquarters had an influence in the way people shared experiences and \ntheir decision making process.  \n \n\u201cPeople are still there and they're very disconnected.  Not sharing. Also the further you are \nfrom London, the more disconnected you are from the decisions, the thinking and our \nunderstanding of what's happened.\u201d  (Meeting 2) \n \n\u201c\u2026that's an issue.  I would like them to take ownership in India for what they're doing because \nit's impossible really to make every operational decision in the project from London.\u201d  \n(Interview 6 ) \n \nIndeed, one of the main challenges that virtual teams face is that they can \nbecome isolated from the core of the company and experience fears of negative \nimpact in career development besides the \u2018physical\u2019 problems of virtual \ncommunication that can create an impoverished emotional interaction with other \nCorporation and NIB\u2019s members. Furthermore, in breaking boundaries and allowing \nemployees to shift identities \u2013being part of the India team and the Corporation- \nvirtuality makes more difficult to construct a recognisable career project (Kallinikos, \n2001). Indeed, the short term projects and contracts made difficult for employees to \ndevelop a common narrative. In a sense detachment from the organisation seemed to \nbe required, not involvement. \n \nDeveloping a culture that supports motivation and co-operation  \nIn order to communicate and work together groups develop their own \nframeworks of interpretation: shared assumptions and beliefs that are held by the \nmembers of a group as a learnt product of the group experience. It is important in \norder to develop a shared sense of identity to have sufficient common experiences to \ncreate a shared view. This presents a challenge for the distributed group whose \nmembers themselves might not be able to define who is a member of their social unit. \nIt is not enough to present a set of recommendations that the group can follow. \nCulture in a team is affected by the group history, experience, the composition of its \nmembers etc. Within a virtual group, the nature and usage of the technology also \nplays a major role in shaping the way the group interacts and therefore the \ndevelopment of a shared interpretative and action oriented framework (Mark, 1999). \n \n\u201c[Now]\u2026we've rented accommodation away from the main  office.  For practical reasons as \nwell as for these reasons, in fairness \u2026 it brings benefits because it then means that the new \nteam can form its own identity, can create its own identity itself and it can hopefully avoid some \nof the worst elements of being part of the Corporation\u2019s identity but pick up some of the best bits \nof being part of the Corporation and getting the Corporation\u2019s identity, and it's predominantly  \nmade up of new-to-Corporation people\u2026\u201d (Interview 6) \n \n\u201cIt's a very, very fine equilibrium between letting the local team act because they know the \nmarket and they know how things have to be done and share the knowledge of the central\u2026I see \nit as a very, very fine equilibrium between trying to impose directives from the central and \nrespecting the local vision of things. (Interview 11) \n \n There were also aspects of interaction and conversational processes that are \nimportant when dealing with far away interactions and communications. Issues like \nthe delay in the conversations, the problems of turn-taking in the conversation, the \nlack of interpretation when it comes to body language etc. also make difficult to \n\u2018interpret\u2019 on-line and telephone conversations and to provide an environment in \nwhich participation becomes easy.  \n\u201c\u2026one of the issues with just tele-conferencing is you tend not to pick up the personal.  \nImmediately talking pure, hard, fast business issues yet the things that actually get in the way of \nforming sometimes aren't those things at all\u2026accent or dialect, language are all blockers, that \nare far greater blockers when it's a virtual team and so, you're talking on the telephone.\u201d  \n(Meeting 1) \n \nAccording to Newell et al (2002) the development of new ways of organising \nconduces to more knowledge-intensive work but it also makes it more difficult to \nmanage. Trust here is also reconfigured in scribed in informational social bonds, \nbonds based less in hierarchical relations and more in the complex, reciprocal \nintricacies of the transverse networks of information exchange. Trust is then based \nless on continuous face-to-face work relations and more on iterated work relations of \na short duration; less on the knowledge of someone\u2019s character and more on the \nknowledge of someone\u2019s resources and his\/her position in the social field.  Giddens \n(1992) calls this active trust, a mater of mutual influence rather than mutual fatedness. \nFurthermore, in an organisation that relies on networks there tend to be less rules and \nprocedures that frame communication, therefore knowledge can be \u2018lost\u2019. There is \nalso less hierarchy. This implies that there are less middle managers to act as \ncoordinators or \u2018information brokers\u2019 between for instance the Corporation and the \ndifferent ventures and therefore subordinates must control their own activities. It is \nthen that the organisation tends to become more \u2018stretched\u2019 and virtual and when \nparticipation can become an issue.   \nParticipation \nWithout a cooperative environment is also difficult to achieve a high level of \nparticipation by all members of the team. Some of the themes emphasised during our \nconversations with NIB\u2019s employees in the India project were ownership, individual \nresponsibility, and dissent. Thus, people felt that participation also meant to have \nspace for dissent and conflict, allowing discussions and disagreements to surface \nthrough the communications. \n \n\u201c\u2026 if the project, is to meet its deliverables and people are to feel that they own the output\u2026\u201d \n(Meeting 1) \n  \n\u201cThe local manager was refusing to allow\u2026 any dissent from the team members. He wanted to \ndemonstrate a unified face to what he considered to be the shareholder boss. The consequence \nof that was that problems that could and should have surfaced early were being pushed under \nthe carpet, not seen or heard at all by the people who continue to fund the project, until it was \ntoo late..\u201d (Interview 4) \n \nCooperation and participation were seen as crucial for the development of both \nthe Ventures and the NIB team by the India Launch Manager since:  \n\u201c\u2026 the values themselves are going to change, as sure as heck, as our team grows. As our \nrecruitment grows in India, then the values that a bunch of Caucasians in London and Houston \nput together, are they going to be the right values for the NIB tomorrow if actually 33% of our \nstaff is in India? Probably not. So even if we don\u2019t want to, we need to cooperate\u201d (Interview 7) \n \nHowever things had started to change between the corporation and NIB and \ntherefore between NIB and its different ventures.  \n \n\u201cIn the beginning, everybody wanted to work for NIB, like a new business in [the Corporation], \nyou know, people said it's risky but it's exciting. This was spring 2000. Now, we're in a different \ntime zone. People are saying, no, I don't want to go to NIB. They haven't delivered last year, it \ncost a lot of money, there is a risk for everyone that works in NIB, if you want to be in [the \nCorporation] long term\u2026\u201d (Interview 5) \n \nIn June 2002, NIB together with two other new business created by the \nCorporation few months before, became re-organised under a third business called \nCorporation Consumer. NIB ceased to exist officially, although most of its employees \nremained as part of the Corporation. The India e-learning team, despite having done \n\u201can excellent job\u201d in the words of their Launch Manager, was suspended, its \nemployees are now working for other companies and most of them not longer part of \nthe Corporation. The following quote summarises the feelings of most of the team \nmembers regarding the breaking up and stopping of the ventures. \n\u201c We're talking about a company that has been around for a long time.  So they're very stuck in \nthe way of doing things. The Corporation like any big organisation, has a bit of  arrogance.  \nThat being us, we're successful.  We know how to do things, therefore everything is going to be \nrosy and no, things are not always rosy at all.  So, that arrogance sometimes it is a problem \nparticularly when you have a geographical and a cultural distance. Sometimes had the central \nbeen a bit more humble and listened a bit more to the local team and their needs, a few things \ncould have been avoided.\u201d (Interview 11) \n \nIn general virtual teams exist in adaptive work environments (Duarte and \nSnyder, 1999). Their work as we have seen is in constant change with new problems \nalways in the horizon. The India e-learning team worked in a highly unstructured \nenvironment with little known rules. Within more technical environments \u2013structured \nand more regulated-  teams can address work with tested methods in a world where \nvariables can be contained, surprises minimised and where mapping, predictability \nand repetition are the norm. However, an adaptive environment like the one described \nby the India e-learning team did not have structured rules and the team had not yet \ndevelop satisfactory responses to the problems they faced. Many employees tend to \nprefer more technical environments where risk, uncertainty and discomfort are lower \n(Duarte and Snyder, 1999). However adaptive environments can generate innovative \nsolutions to new challenges that the Corporation might have benefited from. \nDiscussion  \nThis paper has looked at the processes of knowledge sharing and generation \namong organisational collectives during the creation of new business ventures. \nThrough the stories that NIB employees tell we have seen how there is a very clear \ntension between: 1) the strong culture of the parent Corporation\u2019s powerful informal \nnetworks and the taken for granted nature of its knowledge \u2018sharing and generating \nsystem\u2019 -represented on standards, ways of working, norms, accountability procedures \netc.- and 2) the efforts by employees at NIB to develop a culture and an identity on \ntheir own. This new NIB identity would have had implications for the type of \u2018market \nniche\u2019 they would have created for themselves outside -in the market- and also inside \n\u2013among the more than 1800 businesses that compose the Corporation. As Kanter \n(2001) suggests, organisations that develop networks internal to their organization are \nable to deal with knowledge more effectively; whereas through external networks \nthey can have better access to additional intellectual and market resources co-evolving \nbetter with their environment. It is the coordination and eventual co-evolution of these \ninternal and external networks that equip organizations to enable spaces where \nknowledge sharing and creation can occur. \nNIB\u2019s employees were aware of the double need of belonging to the \nCorporation but developing a different way of organising.  Thus, they needed the \nexperience, knowledge and support of the Corporation and at the same time enough \nspace to self-organise on their own. They attempted to explore and find the niche \nwhere they could grow, contribute and \u2018add value back\u2019 to the Corporation. The social \nnetworks both at NIB and at the Corporation acted as enablers and at the same time as \ninhibitors of that process.  \nSocial  networks were enablers in allowing people to share and develop new \nways of relating and sharing without having to go through very standardised\/explicit \norganisational arrangements to do so. However they have \u2018continuity and \nmaintenance\u2019 needs on their own. They indeed have their own emergent structural \nproperties and underlying logic that can present itself as a constraint for \u2018new comers\u2019 \nthat need to \u2018play the system\u2019 before they can gain access to and use it. For example, \nin the India e-learning project, people were allowed to explore and develop their own \nways of doing things in India away from the constraints that the Corporation would \nhave represented had they been in London. However the very fact of having been far \naway and protected by their launch manager in the London HQ from potential \n\u2018interferences\u2019 created a barrier for the India team to be part of the Corporation and \nbenefit for a possible future inside it. This protected situation created extra-\norganisational boundaries for the team when it came to i) learn from the Corporation \nand ii) to be able to contribute back to it. Their own development was both aided and \naborted.  \nIndeed, the participation and maintenance of the social networks within the \norganisation is central to the employees\u2019 stories. However, within these networks the \nagent at the end of the line of communication does not appear relevant any longer. \nThe network seems to be gradually replacing the old organisational setting based on a \nrationalised bureaucracy with a very clear and identifiable receptor at the end of that \ncommunication line. Mobility, inter-activity and pervasive connectednesses are \nemphasised and have an impact on the way people organise themselves. The \nindividuals included in the network are being empowered by this transformation. \nHowever, it also leads to extreme vulnerability for those excluded from the network, \nand with little bargaining power to negotiate working conditions.  \nAt the root of the employees\u2019 stories, there is a process of differentiation. \nWhat employees seem to suggest is that the emerging ways of organising in which \nthey participate do not take the form of a group in which they depend on others as \ncolleagues, as members, as people. The organisation that is emerging creates a \ndifferent type of bonding. People eventually depend on others through what it is \nrepresented through the network of communications. In other words, the \n\u2018development\u2019 seems to be towards more dependence on communication channels and \non how people communicate rather than on who is at the other side of the \ncommunication channel. This expansion of a networking form of organisation, even if \nit augments the human powers of organising and integration, also undermines our \nconcept of a separate, independent subject helping to subvert the notions of \nsovereignty and self-sufficiency. This process includes also the search and the \ncreation of difference through the comparison with the \u2018Other\u2019. That is, employees\u2019 \ntell of two forms of organising: one that tends towards connectivity and homogeneity \nbut  that  provokes and runs hand in hand with the construction of difference, \nboundaries, distinctiveness and uniqueness (Hall and du Guy, 1996).  \nThis is reflected in the way we relate at work and through work. We have seen \nin our example how the social bond at work was less bureaucratic and more \ninformational, increasingly created on a  project-by-project basis by the movement of \nideas and the establishment of only temporary standards and protocols. This \u2018network \nsociality\u2019 (Wittel, 2001) is emerging alongside and sometimes displacing the idea of \nthe organisation as a community. A community entails \u2018stability, coherence, \nembeddednes and belonging\u2019 (Wittel, 2001:51); it involves strong ties, proximity and \na common history or narrative of the collective. However, the sociality that the \nnetwork represents does not involve so much belonging but rather processes of social \nintegration and disintegration. In this sociality relationships are not \u2018narrational\u2019 but \ninformational, not based on mutual experience or common history but primarily on a  \nexchange of data or catching up (Sennet, 1998).  \nMore empirical attention will need to be devoted to networking, as social \npractice is under-researched, it lacks solid empirical data and it needs ethnographical \nexploration. The relationship between different forms of capital: social, economic. \nCultural. Bourdieau (1986) emphasises the convertibility of these different forms of \ncapital. How is social capital transformed, transferred, translated into economic \ncapital? How is the antagonism between functionality and morality negotiated in the \nnetwork sociality? Micro-dynamics of the network relations: trust, loyalty, hierarchy, \npower and conflict need to be addressed and investigated in the framework of \nnetworking. \nThe notion of a network can also shadow issues of power in knowledge \ndistribution. Differences in knowledge \u2013e.g. its presence or absence in particular \ncollectives- gives much of the momentum for our social interaction, from gossip to \nthe division of labour. As Barth (2002:1) says: \u201cwe must share some knowledge to be \nable to communicate and usually must differ in some knowledge to give focus to our \ninteraction\u201d.  \nThe final question would be then how to allow for the development of local \nknowledges and ways of working while sustaining the collective intellectual capital of \na company? How to allow for both the development of new organised structures and \nnew knowledge?  A way forward may be enabling the construction of a  \u2018knowledge \nspace\u2026an interstitial space, a space that is created through negotiation between \nspaces\u2019 and  that allows the \u2018fertilisation of different knowledge traditions\u2019 and \ndifferent ways of working (Turnbull, 2000).  \nThis research has presented the active members of a network not as passive \nrecipients of actions and knowledge being imposed by other more powerful members \nof the network. Neither has portrayed the network as static resource on which \nnetworkers tap on when needing individual benefits (Sell-Trujillo, 2001). Networking \nis seen here as a social practice a new kind of sociality, an emergent and complex \nprocess. \n \nComment [LST1]: Ummm\u2026 I see what \nyou mean, but I did not get that picture \nfrom reading the extracts you included; \neven though as with a community, it does \nnot seem to require stability and proximity, \nto me there must be some form of \u2018code\u2019 of \nentry given that the people reported having \nto re-start and work on the network (so \nthen, they were not \u2018doing it right\u2019). It is a \nform of relationship, but obviously if it gets \ncompared with that of community members \nit will \u2018fail\u2019 as it is different.  \nBibliography \nAlavi, M. and Leidner, D.
