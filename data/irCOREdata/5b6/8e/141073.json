Introduction33\n34\nIn recent years there has been an increasing demand for the development of parallel35\nanalytical testing platforms and this has led to increased research into miniaturised36\nbiosensors, biosensor arrays, and chip based testing systems. Within the commercial37\nmarket it is already possible to obtain DNA-based testing systems, however there is still38\nan unmet need when considering the use of proteins as the functional units. This is39\npossibly due in part to proteins being less stable and also their characteristic to denature40\nonce in contact with the surface to which they are immobilized.41\n42\nThe incorporation of antibodies into conducting polymer films was first reported in 199143\n[1]. Anti-human serum albumin (anti-HSA) was incorporated into a (poly)pyrrole film,44\nwhich was galvonostatically polymerized onto a platinum wire substrate. When the45\n3pyrrole anti-HSA was exposed to 50 \u00b5g mL-1 HSA for 10 min, a new reduction peak was46\nobserved at a potential of +600 mV versus Ag\/AgCl. Since this preliminary work there47\nhas been an increase in the development of electrochemical immunosensors, as reviewed48\npreviously elsewhere [2-4].49\n50\nPrevious work within our group has shown that up to 2-3 \u00b5g of antibodies for bovine51\nserum albumin (BSA) and digoxin may be successfully incorporated into conducting52\npolymer films by entrapment in an electrochemically grown (poly)pyrrole film with no53\ndetrimental effect to antibody activity [5]. Further work utilized an ac impedance protocol54\nas the method for interrogation for these films [6]. A protocol was then developed for55\nimmobilizing antibodies onto polyaniline-coated screen printed carbon electrodes which56\nutilized the classical avidin-biotin interaction. This enabled the construction of57\nimmunosensors for the antibiotic ciprofloxacin [7, 8], the heart drug digoxin [9] and for58\nmyelin basic protein [10] - which could detect their respective targets with detection59\nlimits of 1 ng mL-1 of the target species. Later work utilized polyaniline microarrays as a60\nsubstrate for the assembly of immunosensors for prostate specific antigen (PSA) [11] and61\nthe stroke marker proteins neuron specific enolase (NSE) [12] and S100[\u03b2] [13], with62\ngreatly lowered limits of detection down to the level of 1 pg mL-1 of the target.63\n64\nBiotin\/avidin chemistry has been used extensively to modify electrode surfaces by protein65\nimmobilization. The attachment of a biotin molecule allows the immobilization of any66\nbiomolecule of the avidin family. Neutravidin protein is a deglycosylated version of67\navidin with four identical binding sites. It has a near neutral isoelectric point (IEP) which68\n4minimizes non-specific interaction and like avidin itself has a strong affinity with biotin69\n(kD = 10-15 M-1) [14,15]. Due to this strong interaction, the complex formation is nearly70\nunaffected by extremes of pH or temperature, organic solvents, and denaturing agents.71\nThe tetravalent binding of neutravidin to biotin allows the construction of a molecular72\nsandwich effect where the bound neutravidin is free to couple to a biotinylated antibody73\nwith the appropriate characteristics needed for the construction of a biosensor.74\n75\nEnolase is a 78 kDa homo- or heterodimeric cytosolic protein produced from [\u03b1], [\u03b2], and76\n[\u03b3] subunits. The [\u03b3][\u03b3] enolase isoform is most specific for neurons, and is referred to as 77 \nNSE. Elevations of NSE in serum can be attributed to cerebral injury due to physical78\ndamage or ischemia caused by infarction or cerebral haemorrhage, coupled with79\nincreased permeability of the blood brain barrier. The serum concentration of NSE has80\nalso been reported to correlate with the extent of damage (infarct volume) and81\nneurological outcome [16]. Additionally, a secondary elevation of serum NSE82\nconcentration may be an indicator of delayed neuronal injury resulting from cerebral83\nvasospasm [17]. NSE, which has a biological half-life of 48 hours and is normally84\ndetected in serum at an upper limit of 12.5 ng mL-1 (160 pM), is typically elevated after85\nstroke and cerebral injury. Serum NSE is elevated after 4 hours from onset, with86\nconcentrations reaching a maximum between 1-3 days after onset [18]. After the serum87\nconcentration reaches its maximum (maybe >300 ng mL-1, 3.9 nM), it gradually88\ndecreases to normal concentrations over approximately one week.89\n90\n5Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is a surface scanning probe technique that91\nallows for the collection of high resolution electrochemical data on a variety of surfaces92\nand has previously been used successfully to investigate various biological systems93\nincluding cells [19-23], enzymes [24-27], and DNA [28-30].94\n95\nWe have, within this work, attempted to utilize the SECM to detect the binding of96\nantibody layers to electrodes and to determine if these systems can be used for the label-97\nfree detection of NSE. This work is intended as a \u2018proof of principle\u2019 study to show the98\nfeasibility of antigen adsorption and imaging rather than the fabrication of either a99\nsensitive antigen sensor or the detailed examination of the polymer and biomolecular100\nfilms absorbed. Once a proof of principle has been demonstrated we will in future work101\nmove towards studying a range of antigens of various molecular sizes and investigate the102\npossibility of fabricating one array containing a number of different antibodies of interest.103\n104\n105\n106\n2. Experimental Section107\n108\n2.1 Chemicals and Reagents109\n110\nFerrocene carboxylic acid, biotinylation kit (part no. BK101), neutravidin,111\npolyethyleneimine (PEI) (MW = 50000) and BSA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich112\n(Gillingham, Dorset, UK). Disodium hydrogen orthophosphate monohydrate, sodium113\n6dihydrogen orthophosphate 12-hydrate and sodium chloride (all \u2018AnalaR\u2019 grade) were114\npurchased from BDH (Poole, Dorset, UK). All reagents were used without further115\npurification. Commercial screen-printed carbon electrodes were obtained from116\nMicroarray Ltd. (Manchester, UK). NSE and monoclonal antibody against NSE - both117\nwith sodium azide preservative, and PSA were supplied by Canag Diagnostics, Ltd.118\n(Gothenburg, Sweden).119\n120\nFor antibody and PEI biotinylation, the procedure outlined in the BK101 kit was followed121\n(see manufacturer\u2019s instructions for details). Biotinylated antibodies were kept frozen in122\naliquots of 200 \u00b5l at a concentration of 0.2 mg mL-1 until required.123\nAll water used was purified with an ELGA Purelab UHQ-II water system (Elga High124\nWycombe, UK). Phosphate buffer (PBS), pH 7.0 contained NaH2PO4 (4 mmol mL-1),125\nNa2HPO4 (6 mmol mL-1) and NaCl (132 mmol mL-1).126\n127\nSECM experiments were carried out using a Uniscan SECM270 (Uniscan Instruments128\nLtd, Buxton, UK). The SECM instrument (shown schematically in figure 1a) is composed129\nof (1) an electrochemical cell, (2) a translational stage capable of high resolution130\nmovement in the X,Y and Z planes (sub-micron), (3) a bipotentiostat for the accurate131\ncontrol of the potential applied at the tip and\/or substrate, (4) a hardware interface132\nenabling the control of (1) and (2), and (5) a PC which provides an interface with the133\nhardware \u2013 and allows the operator to accurately control the parameters of the SECM134\nprocedure. Pt counter electrodes and Ag\/AgCl reference electrodes were also utilized as135\n7shown in figure 1b. Ferrocene carboxylic acid (5 mmol l-1 in pH 7.0 phosphate buffer)136\nwas used as the mediator (figure 1c).137\n138\n2.2 Substrate patterning139\n140\nIn the immunosensors previously developed within our laboratory, cyclic voltammetry141\nwas utilized to deposit polyaniline films on the carbon electrodes [7-13]. This was142\ndeemed inappropriate for the preparation of electrodes to be interrogated by SECM as it143\nis not possible to compare a modified region with an unmodified region. Any changes in144\nthe tip current obtained may be due to fluctuations in the background current and not due145\nto changes in the charge transfer properties of the modified substrate. It was therefore146\ndecided that for SECM interrogation, the polyelectrolyte film should be patterned in an147\narray dot format. By producing this pattern, background effects in the measured current148\ncould therefore be eliminated and any changes in the current over the modified surface149\nwould contrast with the current over regions of unmodified carbon. Since it would not be150\npossible to use polyaniline in this format it was decided to use PEI which has previously151\nbeen used within the group when interrogating DNA arrays with SECM [30].152\n153\nA borosilicate glass capillary was pulled to an internal diameter of 80-100 \u00b5m using a154\nNarishige PP-830 pipette puller (Narishige International Limited, London, UK) and the155\ntip polished to a flat finish. This capillary was then filled with a 1% biotinylated PEI156\nsolution and, using the micropositioning stage on the Uniscan SECM270, used to157\nfabricate a biotinylated PEI array (figure 2). Each of the dots were distanced 300 \u00b5m158\n8centre to centre and approximately 200 \u00b5m in diameter. After patterning, the substrate159\nwas then rinsed with UHQ water. Once the area was dry 20 \u00b5l of neutravidin (10 mg160\nmL-1 in water) were placed on the dotted microarray for 1 h, followed by rinsing with161\nwater. 20 \u00b5l of biotinylated antibody (0.2 mg mL-1 in water, 1 h) were then added162\nfollowed by further rinsing. Finally non-specific interactions were blocked by BSA (10-6163\nmol L-1 in PBS, 1 h).164\n165\n2.3 SECM studies166\n167\nA screen-printed carbon electrode substrate was placed in a plastic Petri dish and exposed168\nto 5 mmol l-1 mediator solution. The SECM working electrode tip and counter and169\nreference electrodes were then immersed into the mediator solution. Prior to undertaking170\nan area scan over the antibody\/PEI functionalized regions, an approach curve experiment171\nwas conducted over the polycarbonate, non-conductive region of the substrate to estimate172\nthe tip-to-substrate distance (Tip Potential (E) = +0.45 V vs. Ag\/AgCl; step size = 10173\n\u00b5m). The tip was positioned at a distance at which the measured current was half that of174\nthe observed current with the tip a few mm distant from the surface of the screen printed175\nelectrode (effectively infinite on this scale) (approximately 70 \uf06dm from substrate176\nsurface); this was to allow for the variation in topography and the height differential177\nbetween this non-carbon region and the slightly raised carbon electrode surface - while178\nalso serving to reduce the risk of tip crash. After tip positioning, an area scan over the179\nfunctionalised region was conducted with a step size of 10 \u00b5m. At no point in the180\nexperiment was the substrate touched; this allowed any change in the observed tip current181\n9to be attributed solely to changes in the charge transfer properties of the surface. In all182\ncases the tip diameter was 8.5 \u00b5m; the scan rate used was 10 \u00b5m per step throughout and183\nthere was no potential applied to the substrate.184\n185\nAfter the first area scan experiment was conducted, the tip was retracted a known safe186\ndistance from the substrate. The mediator solution was then removed and the substrate187\ngently rinsed with UHQ water before applying a solution containing complementary188\nantigen over a range of concentrations or a non-complementary antigen. After exposure189\nfor 1 hour, the antigen solution was then removed and the substrate again rinsed before190\nthe re-introduction of fresh mediator solution. A second area scan experiment was then191\nconducted over the same functionalised area as measured previously. The tip current data192\nfrom the area scan before exposure was then subtracted from the tip current data193\nfollowing this exposure. Throughout all these experiments the sample substrate does not194\nmove at all, i.e. all exposures, rinsing steps etc are performed with the sample in situ. It is195\nworth noting here that after each exposure and rinsing step the Petri dish is refilled with196\nfresh mediator solution and the tip exactly repositioned, made possible using the XYZ197\nmicro-positioning stage of the SECM270. This allows precise and reproducible imaging198\nof the same area of the electrode.199\n200\n3. Results and Discussion201\n202\nTo ensure that changes occurring on the sensor surface were directly related to the203\nhybridization of antibody and antigen, and not due to interference of mediator solution or204\n10\npoor stability of the substrate, surface scans were undertaken of the antibody modified205\ndotted arrays (figure 3a). The modified surface displays an array of peaks which206\ncorrespond to decreases in the tip current. This can be accounted for by the207\npolymer\/antibody composite acting as a barrier to mediator diffusion to the surface,208\nthereby diminishing the current since polyelectrolytes are known to act as barriers to ion209\nmigration [31].210\n211\nAfter this initial scan, samples were incubated in purified water for 30 mins in parallel to212\nthe immunochemical exposures but in the absence of antigen. Following rinsing, fresh213\nmediator solution was introduced. A scan of this surface is shown in figure 3b.214\nSubtraction of figure 3a from 3b (figure 3c) clearly shows only minimal variations,215\nindicating that minimal changes in background current are seen and that there is no loss216\nof material from the surface. Other techniques employed to dot down the array were217\ninvestigated. These included the direct dotting of antibody onto the carbon surface,218\nhowever, these proved to be unstable and deterioration of the array could be visualised as219\nthe scan progressed.220\n221\nBinding experiments were performed by soaking the modified antibody dotted arrays in222\nsolutions of varying concentrations of the complementary antigen for 30 mins, followed223\nby scanning in fresh mediator solution. A control was also run using 5 pg mL-1 PSA to224\nensure changes could be related to specific antigen\/antibody binding rather than simple225\nnon-specific absorption of proteins to surfaces. Binding experiments were carried out226\nusing NSE solution with concentrations ranging from 500 fg mL-1 - 200 pg mL-1 in water.227\n11\nDetailed results (figures 4a \u2013 c) are presented for the exposure to 200 pg mL-1. Figure 4a228\ndepicts the scan over the dotted array before incubation, with figure 4b showing the scan229\ntaken after exposure to 200 pg mL-1 NSE. Figure 4c shows the difference between the230\ntwo scans indicating changes to the tip current over both the carbon surface and the231\ndotted substrate. Figure 4c shows that across the whole of the array there is a general232\nincrease in measured tip current. The change in tip current is, however, seen to be much233\ngreater in the areas of the PEI\/biotinylated antibody dots than for the untreated carbon234\nsurface.235\n236\nNSE is known to have both positively and negatively charged areas on the surface of the237\nprotein [32]. The cationic areas of the protein are capable of electrostatically attracting238\nthe ferrocene carboxylic acid (which is anionic at pH 7 due to ionisation of the acid239\ngroup), thereby increasing the flux of the mediator to the microelectrode tip. There is also240\nthe possibility of hydrophobic interactions between the ferrocene unit and any241\nhydrophobic regions of the NSE protein. These could effectively increase the242\nconcentration of ferrocene carboxylic acid at the surface and thus enhance the current243\nflow.244\n245\nEvidence for this type of behaviour comes from earlier work on DNA where the charge246\non the mediator is found to determine the electrochemical response at the surface. DNA is247\nan anionic polymer due to the presence of phosphate groups and when an anionic248\nmediator is utilised (ferricyanide), increasing the amount of DNA at the surface by249\nhybridisation led to a decrease in current transfer due to repulsion and inhibition of250\n12\nmediator diffusion [33]. However when a cationic hexaamine ruthenium mediator was251\nused, increasing the amount of DNA led to an increase in current transfer [30]. This is252\nthought to be due to the cationic mediator being bound by the anionic DNA, thereby253\nincreasing the local concentration of mediator at the surface and enhancing electron254\ntransfer between the surface and the probe tip. In a similar fashion we believe the binding255\nof antigen causes a localised increase of mediator (in this case ferrocene carboxylic acid)256\nby the same principle and leads to increased current transfer.257\n258\nThe results demonstrate that NSE is bound at the surface in greater concentration in the259\nmodified areas, indicating that specific binding is indeed occurring. There appears to be260\nsome non-specific binding as shown by the increase in current over the unmodified261\ncarbon surface however, this non-specific binding was only observed a the highest262\nconcentration of 200 pg mL-1 and not when investigating the lower antigen263\nconcentrations. This confirms our earlier results obtained with microelectrode arrays.9264\nFurther confirmation was obtained by control experiments with PSA which showed a low265\nlevel of non-specific binding over the entire surface but no specific binding to the anti-266\nNSE; this is demonstrated in figure 5a.267\n268\nIn each investigation, an array of twelve dots was imaged with a surface profile being269\nobtained for each separate dot. The twelve profiles could be combined to give a mean270\npeak magnitude response for these dots. Figure 5a shows the mean traces for 12 dotted271\nsamples, exposed to a variety of concentrations (0.5-200 pg ml-1) of NSE and it is clear272\nthat an increase in tip current as the concentration of antigen increases occurs over the273\n13\nmodified regions. For 200 pg mL-1 the dot profile appears larger and this is believed to be274\ndue to saturation of the area resulting in a much greater level of non-specific binding to275\nthe carbon being observed. There is also sign of the dot swelling in size at 20 and 50 pg276\nmL-1 antigen concentration however, at the lower concentrations (0.5-5 pg mL-1) there277\nis clearly very little change in current to the carbon region. Figure 5b shows a calibration278\nprofile obtained by plotting the peak mean dot responses with respect to antigen279\nconcentration. A linear relationship can be seen between the response and the log of the280\nconcentration in the range 0.5 pg mL-1 to 200 pg mL-1. A logarithmic relationship has281\nalso been found between ac impedance and antigen concentration in previous282\nimmunosensor work [8,10]. This demonstrates the potential for this technique to detect283\nand quantify the presence of a target in solution.284\n285\nThe limits of detection for NSE in this experiment (0.5 pg mL-1 to 200 pg mL-1) are286\ncomparable to those obtained with sonochemically microfabricated arrays (0.5 pg mL-1)287\n[12] - and substantially lower than we obtained for similar systems based on288\nmacroelectrodes [7,8,10]. Previous work has succeeded in imaging layers of immobilised289\nantibodies [34], however their technique required the use of enzyme modified antigens290\nand also only reported the use of excess labelled antigen whereas our technique is label-291\nfree and is capable of producing a calibration curve. The sensitivity of our method also292\ncompares well with fluorescence based assays, for example when microarrays on silicon293\nwere utilised, antibody-peptide specific interactions could be observed with a detection294\nlimit of 0.5-1 ng mL-1 [35, 36].295\n296\n14\nThe key significance of this work is that for the first time we have demonstrated the297\nfeasibility of SECM antibody based arrays for the development of high throughput298\nlabeless affinity based analysis. This highly simplified approach could in some contexts299\ndirectly challenge the fluorescence based approach for molecular diagnostic and\/or other300\napplications.301\n302\n4. Conclusions303\n304\nWe have within this paper demonstrated the potential for utilising the SECM to image305\narrays of immobilised antibodies and furthermore detect binding of the antigen using a306\nlabel-free protocol. A clear relationship between the antigen concentration and the307\nchanges in the signals obtained for binding to the arrays is observed. A calibration profile308\nshowed a clear correlation of change in current with respect to antigen concentration with309\ndetection limits of 0.5 pg mL-1 to 200 pg mL-1 . The low (pg mL-1) limits of detection will310\naid in the analysis of physiological samples since they can be diluted before use therefore311\ndiminishing the effects of interferents.312\n313\nThe results obtained within this work demonstrate the feasibility of using the SECM to314\nanalyse surface binding of antigens. This technique although slower than fluorescent315\nmethods, has a significantly lower cost base and does not require labelling of any kind,316\nincluding fluorescence of samples. Further work to be conducted will include the317\nimprovement of the preparation of arrays to increase the number of samples being tested318\nat one time and also to allow for \u2018control dots\u2019 being incorporated within an array.319\n15\n320\n321\n16\nAcknowledgements322\n323\nThe authors would like to thank Dr Michael Cauchi and Dr Lee Larcombe for help324\nimaging and formatting scan surfaces as well as Cranfield Health for funding a PhD325\nproject for JLH.326\n327\nReferences328\n329\n[1] John, R.; Spencer, M.; Wallace, G.
