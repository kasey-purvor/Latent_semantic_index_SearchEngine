It is widely known that the\nrelationships between the dynamic forces and dynamic displacements are not linear,\nexcept at small perturbations. A continuing problem has been how to interpret\n\u201csmall\u201d. The range of validity of a conventional linear model (maximum orbit size for\nwhich the model makes acceptable predictions) is surprisingly restricted and depends\non the orbit shape [1] and the test frequency, as well as the design and running\nconditions of the bearing. A greater range of validity and higher accuracy may be\nobtained by the use of a more complete oil film model with a greater number of terms\nbetter able to describe the non-linearity.\nThis Paper considers the problems of non-linearity and the calculations needed to deal\nwith a higher-order dynamic oil film model. It also describes applications to existing\ntheoretical and experimental results and proposes a methodology for acquiring the\nexperimental data and making the calculations needed to identify a higher-order\ndynamic oil film model.\n2 Higher-order dynamic oil film models\nIn order to obtain a more general description of the oil film dynamics, giving a greater\nrange of validity, it is necessary to use a mathematical model containing higher-order\nterms. In this Paper, the oil film coefficients are denoted in the form \u201cA\u201d with\nsubscripts. The first subscript indicates the line of action of the force arising, for\nexample \u201cAx\u201d. The next subscripts denote the parameters to be used in conjunction\nwith this coefficient. This will use one or more of x, y, ,x\uf026 y\uf026 . A first order (linear)\ncoefficient uses one of the parameters at a time. An example would be yAx\uf026 defining a\ncoefficient describing a force in the x direction proportional to the velocity in the y\ndirection. There are four first-order Ax force coefficients and four first-order Ay force\ncoefficients, giving the familiar eight coefficients. A second order coefficient uses\ntwo of these parameters multiplied together. An example would be xAxx\uf026 , describing a\nforce in the x direction arising from the product of x and x\uf026 .\nA second order model will contain eight first order coefficients, eight coefficients in\nwhich the parameters are squared (sometimes called the direct terms) and 12\ncoefficients in which different parameters are multiplied together. This gives 28\ncoefficients. Other models that might be useful are:\na) The conventional first order (linear) model with 8 coefficients.\nb) A model containing the first order terms and the second-order direct\nterms, giving 16 coefficients.\nc) A model containing the first order terms, the second order direct terms\nand the third order direct terms, giving 24 coefficients.\nd) A model containing the first order terms and the second-order terms,\ngiving 28 coefficients.\ne) A model containing the first order terms, the second order terms and the\nthird order direct terms, giving 36 coefficients.\nAll these models have been described in the Literature [2], [3], [4] and some authors\nhave suggested that some of the terms might be omitted without much loss of\naccuracy. However, the extent to which the different coefficients contribute to the\ntotal force depends on the circumstances, so each situation has to be considered\nseparately. Even higher-order models are possible, but have not been used, mostly\nbecause of the size of the resulting model and the amount of information needed to\nidentify all the coefficients. A full third order model contains 68 coefficients, a full\nfourth order model contains 138 coefficients. It is evident that the smallest possible\nmodel that gives the required range of validity should be used. It will be shown later\nthat inclusion of higher-order direct terms in the proposed model has considerable\npractical advantages, outweighing the disadvantage of increased model size.\n3 An overview of non-linearity in the oil film dynamics\nNon-linearity causes effects not seen in linear systems to arise, some of which may\nnot be well known. An oil film is somewhat more complicated than many non-linear\nsystems because of the number of factors involved. These include the effects of\nvelocity as well as displacement in each of the two axes directions, with cross\ncoupling between axes, displacements and velocities. It is useful to start by\nconsidering a very simplified analysis, in order to illustrate some of the problems that\nneed to be overcome. This analysis considers only the self-stiffness in one axis. The\nrelationship between the force and the displacement may be represented as a power\nseries, of the form:\nFx = Axx*x+Axx\u00b2*x\u00b2+Axx\u00b3*x\u00b3 +------ (1)\nIt is important to note that the force is expressed as a function of a power series of the\ndisplacement, rather than the other way round. However, in dynamic tests, it is\nconventional to provide excitation by specified forces, rather than by specified\ndisplacements. This complicates matters considerably, as will be explained below.\nA representative example, using figures from Bannister [2] gives\nFx=1.17x+4.5x\u00b2 (2)\nBoth Fx and x are non-dimensional, Fx is in comparison with the static load and x is\nin comparison with the bearing clearance. Fig 1 shows the transfer function between\nFx and x as a curve, up to displacements of \u00b110%c. This displacement range is\nconsidered by many to be in the acceptably linear region. The linear relationship\n(Fx=1.17x) is also shown and it will be noticed that the two are only reasonably close\nup to about 2% of bearing clearance. The end of range force one way is about twice\nthat in the other.\n-0.15\n-0.1\n-0.05\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n-0.1 -0.08 -0.06 -0.04 -0.02 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1\nx, displacement\/clearance\nFx\n,f\nor\nce\n\/s\nta\ntic\nlo\nad\nFigure 1 Transfer function between force Fx and displacement, x\nThe response of the non-linear transfer function (see equation 2) to a sinusoidal\nexcitation force of non-dimensional value 0.070 (0-peak) is shown in Fig 2., in which\nthe excitation is also shown for reference. The response was calculated by solving the\nquadratic equation relating displacement and excitation force (Equation 2) for a\nsuccession of time steps of the sinusoidal force. Although the response is well within\nthe \u00b110%c range often assumed to be linear, it will be noticed that the displacement\nwaveform is not sinusoidal. The positive peaks of the displacement are less than\nwould arise in a linear system: the negative peaks are greater.\n-0.12\n-0.1\n-0.08\n-0.06\n-0.04\n-0.02\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0 90 180 270 360 450 540 630 720\nTime(degrees)\nEx\nci\nta\ntio\nn\nan\nd\nre\nsp\non\nse\nExcitation, force\nResponse, displacement\nFigure 2 Displacement under sinusoidal force excitation\nBoth the force and displacement are periodic, so may be represented by Fourier series.\nOn analysis, it is found that the Fourier series for displacement is infinite, although\nthe non-linearity is only second order. Part of the spectrum is illustrated in Fig 3, with\nthe values shown as percent of the fundamental (first harmonic). The non-dimensional\nvalue of the first harmonic is 0.0676. The higher terms decrease in size quite quickly\nin this example.\nFigure 3 Frequency domain analysis of displacement waveform\nWork described later in this paper suggests that somewhere between 6 and 12\nharmonics are usually sufficient to give an adequate representation of the waveform.\nIn the conventional method of extracting oil film coefficients, the fundamental\ncomponents of the waveforms are used. In this example, this would give:\nAxx = Force\/displacement = 0.07\/0.0676 = 1.04 (3)\nHowever, it is known that the value of Axx used in the derivation of the waveforms is\n1.17 (see equation 2), so this estimate is somewhat more than 10% in error. The error\nincreases as the square of the orbit size in this region of mild non-linearity.\nIn summary with a sinusoidal force excitation, non-linearity causes the displacement\nwaveform to contain an offset term and an infinite series of harmonics. It also changes\nthe value of the coefficient associated with the fundamental frequency, leading to\nmodel errors in conventional linear methods.\nHarmonic analysis of displacement\n13.84\n100.00\n15.41\n4.94\n2.00 0.91 0.45\n0.00\n20.00\n40.00\n60.00\n80.00\n100.00\n120.00\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nHarmonic order number\n%\nof\nfu\nnd\nam\nen\nta\nl\n4 The experimental identification of a higher-order dynamic oil film model\nThere are three interrelated issues here. The first is the form of the mathematical\nmodel, the second is the experimental results needed to provide sufficient information\nfor its identification and the third is the calculation method. If linearity is assumed, it\nis known that two suitable tests with different low-level excitations will give a result\nand many methods have been reported. However, almost all reported investigations\nlack validation of the assumption of linearity. At the start of an investigation into non-\nlinearity, it will not be known how many results will be needed, or what would be\nappropriate excitation conditions for the various tests There is very little\nexperience\/information currently available for such validation.\nHowever, it is possible to propose a test method that can accept any reasonable initial\nassumption and refine it in the light of information then gathered. This new procedure\ncan accept any reasonable oil film model and allows the researcher to choose suitable\ntest results as the investigation proceeds. It also allows the researcher to establish\nwhen sufficient information has been acquired and allows the quality of the\nidentification to be assessed. It is an interactive method, and the number of steps to its\nconclusion will not be known in advance.\nA suitable calculation procedure termed \u2018Comprehensive Calculation Method\u2019 (CCM)\nto accompany it is described below. The proposed method allows the use of any two\nof the (i) dynamic forces, (ii) dynamic displacements and (iii) oil film model to be\nused to predict the third. The method uses frequency domain descriptions of the\nexcitations and responses. The frequency domain is used because it is the most\nappropriate domain for repetitive signals. Repetitive (preferably approximately\nsinusoidal) excitations give the best possible signal\/noise ratio, which is crucial to\naccurate identification of the dynamic oil film coefficients. The signals are\nrepresented as Fourier series, which gives a compact description.\n5 The Calculation procedure (\u201cCCM\u201d)\nThe basis of the method is to conduct a series of force balances and seek the solution\ngiving the best overall agreement. These force balances are conveniently conducted at\nregular intervals round a cycle of the excitation, for each excitation (shake test) in\nturn.\nIn the description below, it is assumed that the dynamic oil film coefficient are to be\ndetermined, so a trial set of oil film coefficients is proposed. Where displacements are\nto be determined from known oil film coefficients and known force excitations, a trial\ndisplacement record is proposed. Where forces are to be determined from known oil\nfilm coefficients and displacements, a trial force record is proposed. The same\ncalculation procedure accommodates all the cases, though the last can also done by\nstraightforward arithmetic methods.\nIn oil film model identification, one side of each force balance is the value from the\nforce record, the other is the calculated force that arises from the response record and\nthe assumed oil film coefficients. The force calculation requires both displacement\n(already known) and velocity, which is easily derived from the Fourier series for\ndisplacement. The force error arising from this balance is recorded. At the end of all\nthe force balance calculations, the balance errors are assessed. In this implementation,\nthe sum of the squares of all the errors is calculated. Other optimisation methods\ncould be used and it is also possible to weight the balance errors according to the\nperceived reliability of the record in use. The assumed oil film coefficients are now\niterated until the least squares solution is found.\nIt is most important that the Fourier series used to describe the test waveforms contain\nthe zero-order terms. These affect the least-squares solution and must not be omitted.\nThe zero order terms are not important in a linear system, so it is not usual to consider\nthem. It is necessary to measure them in a higher-order investigation, so it is not\npossible to use high-pass filtering in the instrumentation chains. Alternative\narrangements, such as fixed offsets, measurements of the zero-order terms by separate\nmeans, or very long-scale A\/D conversion must be made. It is possible (but strongly\ndeprecated) to omit measurements of the zero-order terms, and include trial values in\nthe least squares fitting process. Simulations of this method show that the solution is\nmuch more sensitive to errors, such as due to noise on the signals, than when the zero\norder terms are given.\n6 An example implementation\nAll the values used in this example are non-dimensional. The dynamic forces are\nscaled by W and the dynamic oil film coefficients are scaled by W\/c, where W=static\nload, c=bearing radial clearance. The displacements are scaled by c, and the velocities\nby c\u03a9, where \u03a9=shaft angular frequency. The frequency of the excitation is defined in\nterms of the quantity (\u03c9\/\u03a9). The shake test frequency is \u03c9 and the calculations cover\none cycle of the dynamic excitation, so \u03c9t takes values between 0 and one step less\nthan 2\u03c0 radians (360\u00ba).\nAs no suitable experimental results for model identification are available, the example\nrelates to the prediction of an orbit from known oil film coefficients and a known\nforce record. The values used are shown below. The CCM would normally be used\nfor oil film coefficient identification, when the order in which the items are presented\nwould probably be different. The basic calculation procedure is identical to that for oil\nfilm coefficient identification, the only difference lies in what is iterated to give the\nbest fit, and how many records are incorporated. In orbit prediction, only one set of\nforce balances is used.\n6.1 Dynamic oil film coefficients\nThere is only one set of assumed dynamic oil film coefficients, as the same values are\nused in all the calculations. In this example, the values shown in Table 1 are from\nReference [2] for the first and second order coefficients for a running condition giving\nan eccentricity ratio of 0.6. In an oil-film model identification, these would be\nassumed and iterated to give the least squares solution. The trial values would\nnormally be zero, unless better values were known. It is normally valuable to include\nthe next highest order direct coefficients, so these are shown, though in this example\nthese higher order coefficients are not used. The significance and use of the third\norder coefficients is explained later.\nTable 1 (assumed dynamic oil film coefficients)\nAxx Axy Axx' Axy' Axx\u00b2 Axy\u00b2 Axx'\u00b2 Axy'\u00b2\n1.17 0.30 1.05 -1.65 4.50 -1.58 4.20 7.95\n-3.6 3 -1.65 7.2 -3.75 -6.45 -6 -12.3\nAyx Ayy Ayx' Ayy' Ayx\u00b2 Ayy\u00b2 Ayx'\u00b2 Ayy'\u00b2\nAxxy Axxx' Axxy' Axyx' Axyy' Axx'y'\n-4.50 2.40 -11.25 -6.75 7.65 -11.70\n15.75 2.7 15.75 12.3 -36 15.75\nAyxy Ayxx' Ayxy' Ayyx' Ayyy' Ayx'y'\nAxx\u00b3 Axy\u00b3 Axx'\u00b3 Axy'\u00b3\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\nAyx\u00b3 Ayy\u00b3 Ayx'\u00b3 Ayy'\u00b3\n6.2 Excitation\nIn this example, the oil film force is theoretical, so a very simple example has been\nselected, and is shown in Table 2. The force series would normally have fewer terms\nthan the displacement series, perhaps up to about order (3\u03c9t). However, in most\npractical examples, the force Fourier series would have more entries than those\nshown, as it would be normal for the excitation to be some combination of two\ndynamic forces in orthogonal directions, and the waveforms may not be pure\nsinusoids. As for the displacement data, the zero-order terms must be included. In a\nreal oil-film model identification shake test, the oil film force is the vector difference\nbetween the excitation force and the inertia force arising from the bush mass and its\nacceleration, and an (\u03c9\/\u03a9) ratio of 1 should be avoided for noise reasons, as discussed \nlater.\nTable 2\nFourier series for excitation forces Fx Fy\n  Excitation method \u03c9\/\u03a9 Force Const Cos(\u03c9t) Sin(\u03c9t) Const Cos(\u03c9t) Sin(\u03c9t) \n1 X shake 1.00 0.0600 0.0000 0.0600 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000\n6.3 Response (displacements)\nTable 3 below shows the predicted displacement orbit arising from the data above.\nThe displacements shown are those obtained at the conclusion of the solution process,\nthe trial values would normally be zero.\nTable 3\nFourier series for displacements\n Const Cos(\u03c9t) Sin(\u03c9t) Cos(2\u03c9t) Sin(2\u03c9t) Cos(3\u03c9t) Sin(3\u03c9t) Cos(4\u03c9t) Sin(4\u03c9t) \nx -0.00557 0.068128 0.029633 0.002695 0.00454 -0.00082 0.00062 -0.0003 -0.00022\ny -0.00492 0.014937 0.035257 -0.00162 7.49E-05 -0.00012 -0.0004 8.43E-05 -5.8E-05\nThe higher-order terms in the Fourier series (up to (12\u03c9t) in this example) for the \ndisplacements are not shown and the values presented are rounded, though the values\nused in the calculations have the full number of digits. In an oil-film model\nidentification, the displacement Fourier series would be measured values. Each\nFourier series should contain sufficient terms to give a reasonable representation of\nthe primary data. The displacement Series might have terms up to between (6\u03c9t) and\n(12\u03c9t). The zero order terms are important, normally non-zero, and must not be\nomitted.\n6.4 Response (velocities)\nThe force balance calculations require the velocities, as well as the displacements and\nthe oil film coefficients shown above. The velocity Fourier series associated with each\ndisplacement series is easily calculated from the Fourier series for displacement and\nthe excitation frequency ratio (\u03c9\/\u03a9), using the method described below. In the non-\ndimensional Fourier series for one of the displacements, consider the terms of order k.\nSuppose that these are:\n(Dkc*Cos(k\u03c9t)+Dks*Sin(k\u03c9t)) (4)\nthe real displacement is:\nc*(Dkc*Cos(k\u03c9t)+Dks*Sin(k\u03c9t)) (5)\nd\/dt{c*(Dkc*Cos(k\u03c9t)+Dks*Sin(k\u03c9t))}=c*{- k\u03c9* Dkc*Sin(k\u03c9t)+ k\u03c9*Dks*Cos(k\u03c9t)}  \n(6)\nLet the corresponding terms in the non-dimensional Fourier series for velocity be:\n(Vkc*Cos(k\u03c9t)+Vks*Sin(k\u03c9t)) (7)\nso the real velocity is:\nc\u03a9*(Vkc*Cos(k\u03c9t)+Vks*Sin(k\u03c9t)) (8)\nEquating terms in either Cos(k\u03c9t) or Sin(k\u03c9t)) gives:\nVkc=k*(\u03c9\/\u03a9)*Dks, Vks=-k*(\u03c9\/\u03a9)*Dkc (9)\nAs k and (\u03c9\/\u03a9) and the Fourier series for each displacement are known, the Fourier\nseries for velocity is then calculated.\nThe velocities arising from the (\u03c9\/\u03a9) value given in Table 2 and the displacements\ngiven in Table 3 are shown in Table 4. As for the displacement series, only the\nlower-order terms are shown, with their values rounded.\nTable 4 (calculated non-dimensional velocities)\nFourier series for velocities\nConst cos(1f) sin(1f) cos(2f) sin(2f) cos(3f) sin(3f) cos(4f) sin(4f)\nxdot 0 0.029633 -0.06813 0.00908 -0.00539 0.001859 0.002446 -0.00087 0.001186\nydot 0 0.035257 -0.01494 0.00015 0.003243 -0.0012 0.000349 -0.00023 -0.00034\n6.5 Force balance calculations\nThese are now performed, step by step. There must be more than twice as many steps\nas the highest order of the displacement Fourier series to avoid loss of information\nand\/or aliasing, but it may be preferable to use considerably more, in order to give\nsmoother output orbits etc. This allows more accurate identification of features such\nas maximum\/minimum values and the positions at which they occur.

In this\nexample, there is only one set of force balances, in an oil film model identification,\nthere will be a set for each shake test and the procedure is repeated for each shake test.\n6.6 Least squares solution\nThe items to be iterated and the target variable are now chosen. The solution\nprocess seeks to set the target variable to the chosen value by iterations on the\nchosen items. The goal would be to achieve as small a target variable as possible in\na reasonable number of iterations. In this example, the items to be iterated are the\nFourier coefficients for the displacements, and the target variable is the sum of\nsquares from the force balance calculations. In an oil-film identification, the items\nto be iterated would be the assumed oil film coefficients and the target variable\nwould be the sum of squares of all the force balances in all the shake tests included\nin the calculations. As mentioned above, trial zero-order components of the Fourier\nseries might be included in the items to be iterated.\n7 Application of the Comprehensive Calculation Method to theoretical\nresults\nThe first application of the CCM was to predict orbits, using the 28-coefficient model\ngiven by Bannister [2].\nIt was intended to use these orbits as a substitute for new experimental measurements\ntaken at excitations large enough to cause non-linear conditions. There were several\nmatters of interest. The first was to assess the errors arising in the first order oil film\ncoefficients in extractions by conventional methods. The second was to assess the\nnumber and nature of shake tests needed to give acceptable predictions of the known\ndynamic oil film coefficients and what accuracy could be expected. It was also\nnecessary to assess how many terms would be needed in the Fourier series and how\nsensitive the coefficient identifications would be to noise.\nOrbits were generated for three running conditions (eccentricity ratios of 0.4, 0.6 and\n0.8), six excitation types (x-shake, y shake, forward unbalance, reverse unbalance,\n+45\uf0b0 shake, -45\uf0b0 shake), three excitation frequency ratios (0.5, 1, 2) and five\nexcitation levels (orbit sizes 2 , 4, 6, 8, 10%c). This gave 270 sets of orbits, described\nin terms of their Fourier series. It was found that terms up to order 12 gave a good\nrepresentation of the waveforms. There was no advantage in a greater number of\nterms. At lower excitation levels (up to what was later found to be the limit of validity\nof the 28-coefficient model), terms up to order 6 were sufficient.\nAt this stage, it was not known how much force balance error was acceptable, so\nvalues of up to a few percent of the excitation force were accepted. The first order oil\nfilm coefficients were identified from the fundamental components of the appropriate\norbits (conventional shake test pairings of x, y, forward and reverse unbalance, \u00b145\u00ba)\nand their associated excitations. These reconstituted coefficients were compared with\nthe linear coefficients in the original 28-coefficient model. The results seemed\ngenerally plausible, with the errors in reconstituting the first order coefficients\nincreasing with excitation level, excitation frequency and eccentricity ratio. It was\nlater found (see below) that the results were invalid in detail, as the higher excitations\nlay outside the range of validity of the oil film model, so they are not presented here.\nAnother aim was to determine how many test cases were needed to give a reliable\nextraction of the 28 dynamic oil film coefficients.\nIn a preliminary comparison, the predicted orbits for the six types of excitation were\nused together with the same level and excitation frequency ratio. Various\ncombinations of level and excitation frequency ratio were considered. For each set of\norbits and corresponding excitations, the 28-coefficient dynamic oil film model was\nidentified. The identified oil film coefficients were then compared with the\ncoefficients [2] used to generate the orbits from the known excitations. It was found\nthat very good identifications of all the coefficients were achieved under lower\nexcitations, but that the errors increased dramatically, particularly for the second order\nterms, with higher amplitude or frequency ratio results, and especially for both at\nonce. This seemed counter-intuitive, as it would be expected that the second order oil\nfilm coefficients would be better identified at higher excitations. It seemed possible\nthat the second order model used for generation of the orbits might be inadequate, as\nit was already known from the generation of a displacement waveform from a force\nwaveform with only the first and second order coefficients for one term that the range\nof validity was limited. Too great a force leads to a prediction of a complex value for\nthe displacement, which, in this context, must be a real number.\nA reliable method of increasing the range of validity of the oil film model would be to\nincrease the order of the model. However, the higher-order terms were not known. It\nwas speculated that provisional dynamic third order oil film coefficients could be\nincluded in the model, and iterated along with the orbit coefficients to find the least\nsquares solution. The complete set of third order oil film coefficients has 40 terms, but\nit was decided to use just the direct terms, of which there are 8. This gave a 36-\ncoefficient oil-film model. At lower excitations, the results were the same as\npreviously obtained with the 28-coefficient oil-film model, but at higher excitations,\nthe force balance errors were dramatically reduced by several orders of magnitude.\nThe results for excitation by forward unbalance (\u03b5 = 0.6, \u03c9\/\u03a9 = 1) are shown in Fig 4.  \nThe errors are reported as:\n(r.m.s value of force balance errors)\/(r.m.s value of excitation forces) (10)\n1.00E-08\n1.00E-07\n1.00E-06\n1.00E-05\n1.00E-04\n1.00E-03\n1.00E-02\n1.00E-01\n1.00E+00\n1.00E+01\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nExcitation as % of static force\nLo\nga\nrit\nhm\nat\nic\nsc\nal\ne\n28 coefficients\n36 coefficients\nFig 4 Force balance errors as % of excitation force\nIt would seem reasonable to interpret Fig 4 as showing that the 28-coefficient model\nis only strictly valid in the range for which both the 28-coefficient models and 36-\ncoefficient models give the same results. In this example, this is to an excitation level\nof 4% of the static force for these conditions. Acceptable validity might extend 5%, as\nthe force balance errors are small (less than 0.1% of the excitation force).\nThe addition of the third order coefficients also had a substantial effect on the\nassigned values of the coefficients and the corresponding size of the orbit at higher\nexcitations. The change in size of the orbit is illustrated in Fig 5, which compares the\norbit sizes arising under the use of 8, 28 and 36 oil film coefficients.\n00.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\n0.14\n0.16\n0.18\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nExcitation level, % static force\nO\nrb\nit\nsi\nze\n\/c\nle\nar\nan\nce\nis\npl\nac\nem\nen\nt\/c\nle\nar\nan\nce\n8 coefficients\n28 coefficients\n36 coefficients\nFigure 5 Orbit size vs excitation level, Forward Unbalance\nIt is seen that the effect of non-linearity is to reduce the size of the orbit, as already\nreported [2], though the shape of the curve with 36 coefficients is not entirely\nplausible at higher excitations. If the eight third order oil film coefficients used\nconstituted a sufficient additional set, it would be expected that the values would be\nthe same for all the orbit predictions. However, it was found that the values assigned\nwere mostly rather variable, depending on the type and level of the excitation. The\nvalue for 3xxA \uf026 was reasonably constant, and to a lesser degree the value for \u00b3xxA . This\nsensitivity to the detail of the excitation indicates that the oil film model is still\ninadequate.\nThe fitting process attempts to find the least sum of error squared, and will find\nincorrect values of the given coefficients to compensate for the missing forces that\nwould have been associated with the missing coefficients. The fit error therefore does\nnot directly represent the missing forces. However, it would be plausible to expect it\nto be zero if there were no missing forces. This emphasises that the least squares error\nhas to be small for the solution to be valid. The addition of some higher-order oil film\ncoefficients to the model is obviously not a complete answer, but it makes it possible\nto define the range of validity of the 28-coefficient model as up to when the third\norder terms start to come into play and their associated forces start to appear. This\ncriterion is probably somewhat pessimistic, and slightly larger excitations may be\nacceptable at the price of increased identification errors.\n7.1 Range of validity of the 28-coefficient model\nRange of validity has been used above as the range over which the oil-film model\nmakes acceptable predictions. This includes the accuracy with which the model\nrepresents the real world, but there is another issue, which affects a higher-order\nmodel, and is most easily explained by reference to a second-order model. A second\norder model contains terms such as shown in Equation 3 above, and the total force is\nthat arising from all the terms noted. All the direct terms will be of the form shown\nand are discussed next. The key difficulty is that each quadratic equation has a limited\nrange of values of force for which the displacement (or velocity) solution has real\nroots, so is mathematically limited in its range. In addition, the relationship between\nthe contribution from each of these sets of terms and the total force depends on the\ncircumstances, so it is not obvious what the mathematical range of validity of the full\nforce equation night be. This is a separate problem from proper representation of the\nphysical domain, and it is reasonable to assume that the force equation can be solved\nwith high accuracy within its range of mathematical validity. Such a solution would\nhave very low residual force balance error.\nThe mathematical range of validity of the 28-coefficient oil film model was\nestablished for the 270 test conditions described earlier and an example set of results\nis shown in Table 6. The range of validity is shown here in terms of orbit size, rather\nthan excitation force. Up to the levels shown, the 28-coefficient model would be\nsufficient and appropriate. Other running conditions and excitation frequencies give\ndifferent ranges of validity for a particular excitation type.\nTable 6\nTest type X shake Y shake Forward\nUnbalance\nReverse\nUnbalance\n+45\u00ba\nshake\n-45\u00ba\nshake\nLimiting\nOrbit size\n0.08 0.058 0.06 0.10 0.08 0.084\nAll values are non-dimensional.

It would be expected that these would be optimum\nvalues for an oil film coefficient identification. For the purposes of this assessment,\nthe results were grouped into the conventional pairs of x and y shakes, forward and\nreverse unbalance, and \u00b145\u00ba shakes.\nA 28-coefficient oil film model was identified for various combinations of \u201ctest\u201d\nresults. The differences between the extracted values and the values used in the orbit\ngeneration were noted. The error was characterised as the rms value of the set of\ndifferences divided by the rms values of the set of coefficients. It was found that any\nsingle orbit and its associated excitation did not allow the extraction of the 28\ncoefficients, which is not surprising as the orbit is specified by 25 Fourier series terms\nin this example. Two orbits allowed a good identification, with less that 0.5% error in\nthe second order terms and less than 0.005% error in the linear terms for any of the\nconventional excitation pairs.\nFour orbits allowed even better identification, especially in the second order terms.\nSix orbits gave essentially zero errors (0.0002% in the linear terms, 0.007% in the\nsecond order terms. These errors arise from shortcomings in the representation of the\nforces and displacements by non-infinite Fourier series and from arithmetic errors.\nThere may have been a contribution from the generation of the orbits, but this should\nhave been small as the range of validity of the model used was not exceeded.\nIn an experimental model identification there would be some (small) amount of noise\nas well. The sensitivity to noise was assessed by perturbation of the input data terms.\nThe change in the identified oil film coefficients was characterised as the rms value of\nthe set of differences divided by the rms values of the set of coefficients. Each term in\nthe Fourier series representing the excitations and responses was perturbed by random\namounts up to 1% of the value of the term. This was done several times, as each set of\nperturbations gave different errors (as would be expected). With six shake tests used,\nthe average error in the oil film coefficients was 0.9% in the first order coefficients\nand 5.3% in the second order coefficients. For four tests, the average error was 1.8%\nfor the first order coefficients and 14% for the second order coefficients, for two tests,\nthe average error was 2.4% for the first order coefficients and 28% for the second\norder coefficients. It is not yet known what a reasonable estimate of noise would be,\nin principle, the level should be much less than the 1% assumed if suitable care is\ntaken in signal acquisition and processing.\nIt is known that four linear coefficients can be identified in a single test with single-\nfrequency sinusoidal excitation under linear conditions. These first-order coefficients\nare identified from the first order displacement terms and it would seem reasonable to\nsuppose that four second-order coefficients could also be identified from the second\norder displacement terms if these are present. In a similar way, it might be expected\nthat four third-order coefficients could also be identified from the third order\ndisplacement terms if these are present. This assumes that the displacements are\nsinusoidal, which they are not, and that force and displacement are interchangeable,\nwhich they are not. In reality, the displacements are non-sinusoidal, and this allows\nmore information to be extracted than for sinusoidal displacements. However, the\ncomponents of the signals containing this information would be small compared with\nthe lower-frequency components, so measurement may be difficult.\nThe number of shake tests needed to extract a given order of oil film model depends\non the accuracy with which the waveforms can be identified, and the amount of\ninformation in the waveforms, which depends on the level and type of excitation. It\nwould seem reasonable to assume that four tests should normally be sufficient to\nidentify a second-order oil film model, though fewer might be sufficient under ideal\nconditions. More might be needed if there is much noise compared with the\ninformation.\n7.3 Effect of neglect of non-linearity on extraction of the linear\ncoefficients by conventional methods\nThe effect is sensitive to excitation level, as well as excitation type, so it is desirable\nthat all the assessments should be done at the same excitation level, in order to allow\ncomparison of results. An orbit size of 5% of the bearing clearance was chosen for the\nfirst assessment, as being within the valid range for all the excitations for the\nexcitations shown in Table 6. This is also non-small (above the 2% limit for linearity\nsuggested earlier). The excitation force in the Y shake was 0.15W, which was\nconsidered more than an experimenter would use in the circumstances, so this was\nreduced to 0.1, giving an orbit size of 3.3%c for this test only. The errors in\nidentification of the linear coefficients were 0.6% (rms value of the set of errors\/rms\nvalue of the set of coefficients) for (Fx, Fy) shakes, 1.1% for forward and reverse\nunbalance and 1.9% for \u00b145\u00ba shakes. None of these errors are very large at these\nexcitation levels for these test conditions, but they would increase at higher excitation\nfrequencies or excitation levels, or at higher eccentricity ratios. The (Fx, Fy) shake\ntest method gave the lowest errors, so is to be preferred.\n7.4 Use of the second-order model to extract the linear oil film\ncoefficients\nIt is possible to use a 28-coefficient extraction, perhaps with six shake tests, and only\npresent the eight linear coefficients. This would offer very high accuracy in the\nabsence of noise, but it is currently not known whether this is realistic. Adequate\naccuracy can be obtained by a conventional (Fx, Fy) test at low excitation levels\n(better than 0.1% error due to non-linearity at an orbit size of under 2%c). It would be\nuseful for future investigators to compare the experimental results from the two\nmethods.\n8 Application of the CCM to existing experimental results\nAs there was no Bearing Rig available to obtain suitable new results at the time of this\nwork, an attempt was made to use existing results. It was known that this might not be\nvery satisfactory, as the tests had not been made with this application in mind, but it\nseemed valuable to assess what problems might arise in an experimental identification\nof higher-order oil film coefficients by this new method.\nThe results selected were obtained some years ago, in a study of a high-speed journal\nbearing. The results seemed interesting in that the displacements contained significant\namounts of harmonics, possibly allowing the identification of higher-order oil film\ncoefficients from tests originally aimed at determining the linear oil film coefficients.\nThe linear dynamic oil film coefficients had been obtained by one of the variants of\nthe method of selected orbits [5]. A figure-of-eight orbit is set up with its crossover at\napproximately right angles and reasonably close to the static running position. This is\nachieved by suitable use of both actuators at once, the one excited at twice the\nfrequency of the other. Prior to this dynamic test, the oil film stiffness coefficients are\ndetermined statically by the method of incremental loading. The region of the\ncrossover is studied, obtaining the crossover point, and the directions of the arms of\nthe orbit at the crossover point. The velocities at the crossover are also obtained for\neach arm. The force record is known and the results are related to give the linearised\noil film velocity coefficients. This allows the determination of the four velocity\ncoefficients in one test.\nThere were no different types of shake tests done at any given running conditions, as\nthe method allows the extraction of the linear oil film velocity coefficients with only\none dynamic test (the stiffness coefficients are measured in a static test). However,\nsome tests were repeated with different combinations of synchronous and twice\nsynchronous approximately sinusoidal excitations. A suitable pair of results was\nselected.\nThe first task was to represent the time histories as Fourier series. At this stage, it was\nnot known how many terms would be appropriate, so various orders of series were\ncalculated with the CCM and compared with the raw data. The basis of the method is\nto assume a Fourier series for each of the orthogonal displacements, and work through\na cycle of the data, comparing the measured values with the predicted values and\ndoing least squares error iterations on the assumed Fourier coefficients. The number\nof Fourier coefficients can be altered and the process repeated.\nIt is always necessary to strike a balance between too few terms in the series, when\nthe general shape is incorrect, and too many, when the detail, which may be due to\nnoise, is followed too closely. In this example, it was found that series to (2\u03c9t) and \n(4\u03c9t) did not follow the measured points adequately, but that series to (6\u03c9t) and \n(12\u03c9t) both gave good fits to the general shape, without following noise irregularities. \nBoth fits were very close in shape and both gave similar fit errors, which now indicate\nthe noise levels. It was concluded that either would be adequate. A fit to order (12\u03c9t) \nfor one of the example displacements is shown in figure 6. The force record showed\nless scatter and a lower harmonic content.\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n-12 -10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8\nh micrometre\nv micrometre\nRaw data\nFourier Series fit\nFigure 6 Comparison of raw and fitted data for a displacement orbit\nThe CCM was used in coefficient extraction mode for two shake tests, one with the\ndynamic force in the horizontal (h) direction at twice the frequency of the dynamic\nforce in the vertical (v) force, the other with the frequencies reversed. Both the results\nwere at approximately the same force level. On running the CCM, with oil film\nmodels of varying complexity, it was found that the force balance errors were very\nlarge, sometimes half or even more of the excitation forces. This is known to indicate\na problem, as force balances should be much better than 1% if the results are to be\nreliable. Additionally, the 36-coefficient model indicated a large force contribution\nfrom the third order oil film conditions.\nAll this indicates that the excitation levels were too high for a 28-coefficient model to\ncope, and a higher-order oil film model would be needed to obtain a sufficient range\nof validity. However, a higher-order model would need many more shake tests than\nwere available for its identification. This, of course, means that the linear coefficients\ndeclared at the time of the tests would have a very restricted applicability. This is\nillustrated in Fig 7, where an orbit predicted from the declared coefficients for the\nknown excitation is compared with the observed orbit. The axes have been rotated\nthrough 45\u00ba and the displacements normalised compared with Fig 6.\n-0.20\n-0.10\n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n-0.40 -0.30 -0.20 -0.10 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40\nMeasured\nReconstructed\nFig 7 Comparison of predicted and observed orbits\nIt is seen that the orbits only agree in the region of the crossover, which is where the\ndeclared oil film coefficients were identified. This indicates that a more complete oil\nfilm model is needed if more of the working range is to be described. The discrepancy\nof slopes at the orbit crossover is due to an unsuitable choice of data processing in the\noriginal work, allowing a high sensitivity to noise. A rework of the method using the\nlinearised oil-film coefficients derived from Fourier series fitted data at the crossover\ngave much better agreement at the crossover, though the general shape of the rest of\nthe orbit was similar to that shown.\n8.1 Comments on the application to existing experimental results\nThis exercise illustrates those results suitable for the identification of higher-order\ndynamic oil film coefficients are best obtained in bespoke tests, in which the results\nare obtained iteratively. In this example, there were not enough different excitation\nconditions to allow the identification of the higher-order coefficients. All the\nattempted force balances led to very high errors, indicating that the model was too\nsmall. If the original aim had been this identification, it would have become apparent\nthat more excitation conditions were necessary. These could have been done at the\ntime of testing. However, the CCM allowed the identification of this problem, and\nshowed that the lack of extraction of a higher-order oil film model should not be\nattributed to poor quality results or a poor identification procedure, but simply on an\ninsufficient number of suitable shake test results.\n9 The measurement of the dynamic properties of a journal bearing in the\nnon-linear region.\nIt has not yet been possible to apply the new calculation method to an interactive\nexperimental test series, so the proposals below are not validated, but are set out to\nencourage other workers to enter this field.\nThe test arrangements and the shake tests themselves would be would be very similar\nto those normally used for linear identifications, except that the test waveforms would\nbe described as Fourier series (including the zero-order terms), instead of only the\nfundamental terms. As the zero-order (constant) terms and the harmonics would\nnormally be quite a small proportion of the signal, and these identify the higher-order\ncoefficients, it is most important that the dynamic results are of high accuracy.\nThe amount of information needed to identify a higher order model is much greater\nthan that needed for a linear model, and it is not possible to predict how much\nrelevant information there may be in a given shake test, so it is not possible to predict\nin detail what test series would be appropriate. It is therefore proposed that the test\nseries is progressed in the light of the test results already obtained.\nIt is envisaged that the operator will run the calculations while the Bearing Rig is still\nrunning at the target conditions, so that alternative, additional or repeat dynamic tests\ncan be run as required. The method is interactive, and the operator has various choices\nas the coefficient identification proceeds. The first choice for the operator is the oil film\nmodel. The method can use any reasonable oil film model and this example assumes\nthat the operator has decided on a 36-coefficient model.\nAn initial set of shake tests is now conducted. It is probably reasonable to use all the\nexcitations regarded as conventional in linear extractions, using six tests with\nexcitations in the x-direction, in the y direction, at +45\u00ba to horizontal, at -45\u00ba to\nhorizontal, forward unbalance and reverse unbalance. It is probably reasonable to use\nexcitation levels giving an orbit size of about 0.1 of the bearing clearance, except for\nthe y-excitation, which would probably require too great an excitation force, so this\ncould be set to about 0.1 of the static load. The excitation frequency must be chosen so\nthat significant spectral lines in the shake response spectrum do not coincide with\nsignificant lines in the shaft signature, in order to avoid noise problems. It is not\nnecessary that the same excitation frequency is used for all the shake tests, so this can\nbe adjusted as required. The excitation frequency ratio would normally be between\nabout 0.5 and 1.\nWhen the initial shake tests have been completed, the results are reviewed, most easily\nby using the CCM to extract the 36 coefficients and give the force fit errors. The forces\nassociated with the third order coefficients should also be calculated. If all the force fit\nerrors are small (less than 0.1% of the excitation level) and the third order forces are\nnon-zero but less than about 5% of the excitation level, the results may be considered\nacceptable as they stand. If the force balance errors are small, and the third order forces\nare zero in some of the tests, it may be useful to repeat these tests at a higher excitation\nlevel. If the force balance errors are too large, and\/or the third order forces are too large,\nthe appropriate tests should be repeated at a lower excitation level. The new results\nshould be substituted for any results at too high excitation level. This process should be\nrepeated until the force balance errors are small enough and the third order forces non-\nzero, but small.\nAs a final check, redundant tests should be run, possibly with different frequency ratios,\nto give a set of results with more than six shake tests. These should not alter the values\nof the observed oil film coefficients. It is possible to propose other iteration strategies\nand\/or error analysis methods, including error-sensitivity analyses, but each worker will\nhave their own ideas on how to proceed.\n10 Discussion\nThe measurement of the linear dynamic properties of a journal bearing is widely\nperceived as being rather prone to scatter and variance of the results, though it has\nbeen shown elsewhere [6], [7] that this need not be so. It has also been generally\nconsidered that taking non-linearity into account compounds the problems so much\nthat only a very few workers have ventured into this field. This Paper has shown that\nthis is an unnecessarily pessimistic view, and non-linearity can be tackled in a\nstraightforward manner\nFor many purposes, such as predicting response to unbalance and stability boundaries\nin reasonably well-balanced turbo-machinery, linear dynamic oil film models are\nacceptable, as long as the oil film coefficients have been identified under low-\nexcitation conditions. Measurement made at high excitation levels but represented by\na linear model will only apply under the same conditions as in the tests, so are of\nlimited use. A past difficulty has been in validating that the test excitations were small\nenough for a linear model to be valid. This is now easily checked by use of the CCM\n(whatever the original method of identifying the coefficients) and comparing the\npredicted and observed responses to the excitations, preferable by comparing orbits.\nThe data must contain all the components of the test signals, not just the fundamental\ncomponents. It is then immediately obvious whether the model is adequate. An\nexample is shown in Fig 7. It is hoped that many workers claiming linearity will make\nthis check as a routine part of the investigation. It might be mentioned that the CCM\ncan be used for linear oil film model identifications, when it can accept the results\nfrom more than two shake tests, so allowing a reduction in uncertainty compared with\nconventional methods.\nAt higher levels of excitation, where non-linearity starts to matter, the waveforms\nbecome non-sinusoidal. As the waveforms are normally repetitive, it is possible to\nrepresent them by Fourier series. Under excitation by sinusoidal forces, it has been\nshown that non-linearity changes the fundamental component of the displacement\nspectrum, which is why linear oil film coefficient extraction methods give errors at\nhigher excitation levels. The novel calculation method described in this Paper accepts\nthese Fourier series and permits the correct identification of the dynamic oil film\ncoefficients. The method relates the excitations, responses and oil film model through\na series of force balances, and can use any two to predict the third.\nThe initial application of the CCM to the prediction of orbits from given dynamic oil\nfilm coefficients and specified excitations demonstrated that this is easy within the\nrange of validity of the oil film model, but not possible outside this range. This is\nbecause the range of validity might be limited by either by acceptable representation\nof the real world, or (as here) by the mathematical constraints in the model equation.\nThere is no corresponding problem when the CCM is used for predicting the orbits\nfrom linear coefficients, or when the CCM is used in oil film coefficient identification\nmode. However, it is not immediately obvious what the range of validity of the model\nmight be, as it is not a constant.\nIt has been found that the range of validity of the second order oil film model is much\nless than might be expected, less than 10%c for a typical example, which many would\nregard (incorrectly) as being in the linear range. However, the range of validity\ndepends greatly on the detail of the excitation. Orbit shape is very important, but\nneeds to be assessed for individual cases, high frequency excitation and high\neccentricity ratios generally reduce the range.\nA method of assessing the range of validity of the model has been developed, and is\nbelieved to be robust. The method consists of adding the eight next highest order\ndirect coefficients to the model. The values are unknown, but are estimated as part of\nthe solution process. The errors arising in the solution process are compared for a\nrange of orbit sizes, when it should be found that the higher-order model has a greater\nrange of validity, as judged by the force balance errors. Where the two error curves\ndiverge indicates the limit for the model with the lesser number of coefficients, the\nlimit of validity of the higher-order model is less well defined, but may be taken to be\nwhen the errors become unacceptable. This may be indicated by the shape of the error\ncurve, as well as by the individual error values. The divergence of the models may\nalso be identified by the onset of forces associated with the higher-order coefficients.\nThe experimental identification of higher-order dynamic oil film coefficients by the\nnew method uses experimental equipment and techniques very similar to those\nalready widely used, so many workers could enter this field. The identification of a\nhigher-order dynamic oil film model needs more than two shake tests, but the shake\ntests themselves can be similar to conventional tests, though probably at a higher\nexcitation level. The only significant difference in signal acquisition and processing is\nthat the test signals are represented as a Fourier series, including the zero-order terms,\ninstead of just the fundamental component.\nIt has been observed that the use of sinusoidal force excitation, giving non-sinusoidal\nresponses, although convenient and conventional, has some disadvantages. The most\nserious is that some of the harmonics of the displacement (an infinite series) might\ncoincide\/nearly coincide with harmonics of the shaft signature, leading to a noise\nproblem. This can be overcome by choice of excitation frequency for the lower\nspectral lines, but this might need fine tuning for higher spectral lines. The second is\nthat it is not obvious what levels of excitations should be used for a chosen oil film\nmodel (or vice-versa) as the harmonics in the responses do not directly indicate how\nmuch non-linearity is present. This leads to the need for iterative extractions, which\nmight result in some of the initial tests being found unsuitable, and need\nabandonment.\nBoth these problems may be avoided by the use of non-sinusoidal force excitations\nthat give substantially sinusoidal responses. Under sinusoidal responses, the\nharmonics in the forces extend only to the order of the non-linearity excited, which\nfor an acceptable model size would not exceed third order. Assuming that the required\nexcitations can be set up in a timely manner, this should give a very convenient and\nrobust experimental technique.\nIt is hoped that this Paper will encourage workers using linear models to check that\nthe assumption of linearity is valid by comparing predicted and observed orbits, and\nthat some workers may be emboldened to consider non-linear dynamic oil film\nmodels.\n11 References\n1.
