Because of its vast number of tourist\nattractions, culture and strategic position, Thailand has been an important\ntourist destination for more than 150 years (Li and Zhang, 1997). Tourism had\ndeveloped without much intervention from the Thai government until the end\nof the 1970s, when the government realized the great contribution of tourism\ngrowth to the national economy, and began to incorporate its development into\nthe national plan. In 1982 the tourism industry became the largest source of\nforeign exchange earnings for the first time. Since the 1980s the tourism\nindustry has experienced rapid growth, and tourist arrivals have increased from\nTOURISM ECONOMICS364\n1.86 million in 1980 to 9.51 million in 2000,1 giving an 8.5% annual increase\nover this period. Meanwhile, tourism receipts have risen from 17.8 billion baht\n(US$868 million) in 1980 to 285 billion baht (US$7,119) in 2000.2 During\nthe 1980s promotional campaigns were launched by the Thai government, and\nthese included the \u2018Visit Thailand Year\u2019 campaign together with the Celebration\nof His Majesty the King\u2019s 60th Birthday Anniversary in 1987.\nIn the late 1990s, the Asian financial crisis had a significant impact on the\nnational economy as well as on the Thai tourism industry. The impact on the\ntourism industry was double-sided. On the one hand, it resulted in the collapse\nof travel agents and tour operators in Japan and Korea; steep increases in exit\ntaxes in Indonesia; fare wars throughout the region; airline lay-offs in Hong\nKong; hotel redundancies; and a proposed (but later shelved) increase in petrol\nprices in Thailand. Such impacts were immediately felt in late 1997, when the\ncrisis started. On the other hand, the currency devaluation resulted in a cost\nadvantage for Thai tourism over alternative destinations. A surge of tourist\narrivals from the European and North America markets occurred in early 1998.\nTo some extent, this offset the loss incurred due to the drop in tourist arrivals\nfrom the Asian markets. As Higham (2000, p 101) states, \u2018tourism is widely\nrecognized as the sector most likely to lead a recovery\u2019.\nConsidering the essential role that the Thai tourism industry plays in its\nnational economy, accurate forecasts of international tourism demand can provide\nvital information for both policy determination by the government (such as taxes\nand subsidies) and strategic planning by the private sector. In terms of analysing\nand forecasting tourism demand, Thailand has attracted very little attention. The\nstudy by Vogt and Wittayakorn (1998) is the only econometric analysis of the\ndemand for Thai tourism. However, the modelling strategy and forecasting\nperformance of the demand models developed in their study were not fully and\nsystematically explored. The empirical results generated from their study are\ntherefore subject to much criticism for the lack of theoretical foundation. This\npaper aims to apply a more rigorous modelling strategy known as the \u2018general-\nto-specific\u2019 approach developed by economists in the early 1990s (see Hendry,\n1995) to investigate systematically the determinants of the demand for Thai\ntourism. The models estimated using this methodology are also evaluated by\nexamining their forecasting performance. Although Song and Witt (2000; 2003)\nhave recently introduced this approach to tourism demand analysis, their studies\nfocus mainly on the theoretical aspects of the methodology, and the appropriate-\nness of this methodology was tested using data relating only to a small number\nof origin-destination pairs. The current research, however, extends Song and\nWitt\u2019s work by including more origin-destination pairs in the empirical study.\nThe contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it adds additional evidence to\nthe literature in supporting the use of the general-to-specific approach to model\nand forecast tourism demand. Second, the empirical findings should provide\nuseful information for decision makers and planners in Thailand.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section sum-\nmarizes the general-to-specific modelling methodology. The third section dis-\ncusses the definitions of the data and shows the preliminary analysis of the\nvariables used. Empirical modelling results and ex ante forecasts for the period\nup to 2010 are given in the fourth section. The last section summarizes and\ndraws conclusions.\n365Modelling and forecasting Thai tourism demand\nMethodology\nMost tourism demand modelling and forecasting studies published before the\n1990s are classical regression analyses, with ordinary least squares (OLS) as the\nmain estimation procedure. The demand models are normally specified as log-\nlinear single-equation models. Economic theory is used to recommend what\nvariables should be included in the demand models, while simple hypothesis\ntesting statistics, such as the t-statistic and F-statistic based on the OLS\nestimates, are used to determine whether or not an individual explanatory\nvariable or all explanatory variables is\/are significant as determinants of tourism\ndemand. However, many of these studies do not pay much attention to pro-\nviding a sound and consistent theoretical framework for tourism demand\nmodelling. If the initial model suffers from autocorrelation or heteroscedasticity,\nwhich is an indication of model mis-specification, the modeller would \u2018add or\nsubtract variables, change the definition of variables and so forth\u2019 on an ad hoc\nbasis in order to solve the mis-specification problem (Gilbert, 1986, p 284).\nSuch a methodology is called the \u2018simple-to-general\u2019 modelling approach. This\napproach does not have a clear modelling strategy and is often criticized for\nits copious data mining.\nIn contrast to this traditional approach a modern econometric methodology,\nthe \u2018general-to-specific\u2019 approach, is attracting more and more attention. Within\nthe general-to-specific framework, the specification starts from a general\nautoregressive distributed lag model (ADLM), which incorporates as many\nvariables as possible supported by appropriate economic theory, and takes the\nform:\n(1)\nwhere y and xs are dependent (tourism demand in our case) and explanatory\nvariables, respectively; l is the lag length, k is the number of explanatory\nvariables, and as and bs are parameters that need to be estimated. By imposing\ndifferent restrictions on the parameters, various specific models may be obtained\nfrom the general ADLM. These comprise the autoregressive, static, growth rate,\npartial adjustment, dead start, leading indicator, common factor, finite distrib-\nuted lag and error correction models. Diagnostic tests are carried out to select\nthe best performing model. The application of the general-to-specific modelling\napproach to tourism forecasting is described in detail in Song and Witt (2003),\nand is summarized here.\nThe general ADLM is first estimated and the sum of squared residuals of\nthe general model is calculated. Then the restricted (specific) model is estimated\nand the sum of the squared residuals of this model is calculated. The third step\nis to test the restrictions imposed by comparing the sums of squared residuals\nof the ADLM and the restricted model using the F-statistic. Since the restricted\nmodel is simple in structure and has more degrees of freedom than the general\nADLM when it is estimated, the specific model is preferred to the complicated\nADLM if the restrictions are accepted.\nOne of the advantages of the general ADLM is that a modern econometric\ntechnique, known as error correction, can be readily incorporated into the\nmodelling process. The error correction model in the tourism context is based\nTOURISM ECONOMICS366\non the assumption that tourists make rational decisions on the demand for\ntourism at time t using all the information available (income, price, substitute\nprices, and so on) in the long run, but make occasional decision errors in\npurchasing tourism products in the short run due to information asymmetry.\nAs a result of the decision errors made by tourists the demand for tourism in\nthe short run deviates from its long-run equilibrium path (or steady state).3 This\ndeviation is not sustainable over time because tourists, as rational agents, learn\nfrom their mistakes and remove their decision errors in order to achieve the\nlong-run equilibrium demand. Therefore, the demand for tourism as a dynamic\nprocess is self-correcting. Engle and Granger (1987) termed this self-correction\nprocess an \u2018error correction mechanism\u2019, and demonstrated that the process may\nbe modelled using the error correction model (ECM).\nThe ECM may be estimated in different ways: the most popular of these are\nthe Wickens\u2013Breusch approach (WB) (Wickens and Breusch, 1988) and the\nJohansen maximum likelihood method (JML) (Johansen, 1988). The Wickens\u2013\nBreusch approach is particularly appropriate for small samples, but assumes that\nthere is only one cointegration (CI) relationship among all the variables in the\ndemand equation, and, consequently, only one error correction model may be\nformulated. (When multiple CI relationships exist, they are \u2018averaged\u2019 into a\nsingle vector.) The Johansen approach allows for multiple CI relationships to\nbe identified. Subsequently, multiple ECMs are obtained and the number of\nECMs equals the number of CI relationships.\nTo evaluate the performance of each specific model and select the appropriate\nones for forecasting, various diagnostic tests need to be carried out. These tests,\nas used by applied econometricians, include the Breusch (1978) and Godfrey\n(1978) Lagrange Multiplier chi-square test for serial correlation, the Jarque\u2013\nBera (1980) chi-square test for non-normality, the Ramsey (1969) RESET test\nfor mis-specification, the White (1980) chi-square test for heteroscedasticity\nand the Chow (1960) test for predictive failure. In addition, the ex post forecast\naccuracy should also be checked, given sufficient observations.\nTo forecast tourism demand using multivariate regression models, various\nindependent variables need to be forecast first. Following Song and Witt (2003),\nthis paper uses the Holt\u2013Winter two-parameter exponential smoothing tech-\nnique to forecast the influencing factors involved, and single-parameter method\nfor error correction terms in the WB and JML ECMs.\nIn assessing the forecasting performance of the selected econometric models,\nARIMA models are employed as benchmarks.4\nData description\nThe empirical study in this paper is based on inbound tourism demand to\nThailand from seven major international markets \u2013 Australia, Japan, Korea,\nMalaysia, Singapore, the UK and the USA.5 Total tourist arrivals from these\nseven countries accounted for more than 50% of total international tourist\narrivals in 2000.6\nThe dependent variable, tourism demand, is measured by tourist arrivals in\nyear t,7 denoted as TOUt. Independent variables include income (GDPt), relative\ntourism price (RRCPt), substitute tourism price (RSUBt), trade volume (TRAt)\n367Modelling and forecasting Thai tourism demand\nand some dummy variables. GDPt is measured by GDP in 1995 prices; RRCPt\nis measured by the CPI (1995=100) in Thailand relative to that in origin\ncountry j, adjusted by the relevant exchange rate; RSUBt is measured by a\nweighted average price index of alternative destinations relative to the tourism\nprice in the origin country.8 Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines are chosen\nas alternative destinations for Malaysia; Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines\nfor Singapore; Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia for the other\norigins. TRAt is measured by the sum of import and export volumes between\nthe origin country and Thailand, adjusted by import and export price indices\n(or unit values, 1995=100) respectively, to generate the constant price form.\nAll of these data have been transformed into logarithms, denoted as the letter\nL in front of the variable names.\nConcerning the effects of one-off events on the demand for Thai tourism,\ndummy variables are included in the original models. DUM74 and DUM79\nare specified to capture the effects of the two oil crises (DUM74=1 in 1974\nand 0 otherwise; DUM79=1 in 1979 and 0 otherwise). DUM87 reflects the\ninfluence of the \u2018Visit Thailand Year\u2019 campaign in 1987 (DUM87=1 in 1987\nand 1988 and 0 otherwise). Given that the effect may be different between\nyears, two dummies are specified to capture the influence of the Asian financial\ncrisis which arose in the middle of 1997, and continued into 1998. DUM97\n(= 1 in 1997 and 0 otherwise) detects the influence in 1997, and DUM98 (=1\nin 1998 and 0 otherwise) in the following year. The Seoul Olympics in 1988\nand the student demonstrations in 1980 are expected to have reduced Korea\u2019s\noutbound tourism to Thailand during the years concerned. Therefore, DUM88\n(=1 in 1988 and 0 otherwise) and DUM80 (=1 in 1980 and 0 otherwise) are\nconsidered in the Korean models to examine the effects of the two events,\nrespectively.9\nThe sample of data covers 1963\u20132000 for Australia and the UK, and 1968\u2013\n2000 for the other countries.

This test is not applied to the other\nfour countries, as demand was clearly affected by the financial crisis and this\nwould invalidate the test automatically. The estimation results are shown in\nTable 1.\nThe lagged dependent variable seems to be the most important determi-\nnant of the demand for Thai tourism, and is significant in all models at\nthe 1% significance level. It indicates that the demand for Thai tourism\nfeatures a stable behaviour pattern, or \u2018habit persistence\u2019, and that the \u2018word\nof mouth\u2019 effect plays an important role in the determination of tourists\u2019\nchoice of Thailand as a tourist destination. Furthermore, the presence of the\nlagged dependent variable in the partial adjustment model (shown in Tables\n3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) is also justified on the grounds of supply constraints\n(Witt, 1980). Income and own price (either lagged or current variables) are\nthe second most vital determinants, both being significant in four out of\nseven cases (at least at the 10% level). The trade volume and cross price\nvariables are also significant in some cases. The signs of the coefficients for\nthe cross price variable show that the chosen alternative destinations appear\nto be substitutes for Thailand in the Australia, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia\nand UK models, and complements in the Korea and USA models. This\nsuggests that tourists from Korea and the USA prefer to visit Thailand along\nwith other neighbouring countries during the same trip, while tourists from\nthe other origins are more likely to choose between Thailand and the alter-\nnative destinations.\nWith regard to the dummy variables, the significance varies from one model\nto another. The Asian financial crisis seems to have had the most widespread\nimpacts on the demand for Thai tourism among the origin countries, as the\nfinancial crisis dummies are found to be significant in four out of seven origin\ncountries (including Malaysia, where the effect is not significant in the general\nmodel but is significant in most of the specific models).\n371Modelling and forecasting Thai tourism demand\nRestriction tests\nTable 2 presents the results for the restriction F tests. The partial adjustment\nmodel, as a result of imposing the restriction b1 = g1 = q1 = j1 = 0 on the\nADLM (Equation 2) seems to be the most prevailing functional form in this\nstudy (accepted by all of the origins except Japan), followed by the dead start\nmodel (b0 = g1 = q0 = j0 = 0 in the ADLM), growth rate model (a1 = 1, b0 = \u2013b1,\nTable 3.

Concerning the\nex post forecasts, the dead start model, reduced ADLM and the WB-ECM\nperform similarly, all being superior to the JML-ECM.\n Table 10 shows that the dead start model, the WB-ECM and the reduced\nADLM produce similar ex ante forecasts, all with average annual growth rates\nbetween 7% and 8%. The ARIMA model and the JML-ECM generate extremely\nconservative and over-optimistic forecasts, respectively, compared with historical\ngrowth records, which shows increases of 6.3% during 1990\u20132000 and 8.0%\nduring 1995\u20132000. The reduced ADLM is the most reliable model according\nto the ex post accuracy measures, and it shows that tourist arrivals are expected\nto rise to 2.56 million in 2010.\nKorea\nThe growth rate and partial adjustment models fit the Korean data best as only\nthese two models pass the restriction tests. As seen in Table 5, the second oil\ncrisis and the Asian financial crisis display significant adverse impacts, as\nexpected. Both DUM97 and DUM98 are significant, indicating that the nega-\ntive influence of the Asian financial crisis on Korean tourism demand in\nThailand has been persistent during the whole process. The influence took effect\nthrough the collapse of Thai travel agents in Korea, as mentioned earlier. In\naddition to the lagged dependent variable, income and substitute prices also\nshow their significant importance during the decision making process. The\nWB-ECM and one JML-ECM are estimated since one CI relationship exists\namong the demand variables.\nIn terms of the ex ante forecasts (Table 10), all the econometric models\ngenerate similar forecast growth rates, whereas the ARIMA model predicts a\nmuch lower growth rate. According to the medium forecasts from the reduced\nADLM, tourist arrivals from Korea to Thailand are expected to increase to 3.20\nmillion in 2010, growing 21.8% each year. This forecast growth rate is much\nhigher than during the last few years.\nMalaysia\nThe partial adjustment model is accepted by the Malaysian data, and passes all\nthe diagnostic tests at the 1% level (see Table 6). The estimates of the reduced\nADLM show that substitute prices are the major consideration of Malaysian\ntourists when faced with the tourism decision. The estimates of the two ECMs\nTOURISM ECONOMICS380\nFigure 2. Forecasts of tourist arrivals from Japan.\nFigure 3.

Forecasts of tourist arrivals from Singapore.\nTOURISM ECONOMICS382\nFigure 6. Forecasts of tourist arrivals from the UK.\nFigure 7. Forecasts of tourist arrivals from the USA.\n383Modelling and forecasting Thai tourism demand\nshow that the financial crisis had a significant impact on the demand for Thai\ntourism by Malaysian residents, although this impact is apparent only in 1997\n(not 1998). The adverse effect is associated with the slowing-down growth of\nincome in the early stages of the crisis.\nWith regard to the ex ante forecasts (Table 10), three levels of predictions\nare achieved (2\u20133%, 10% and 20%). Only one econometric model predicts in\nthe 2\u20133% range and only one model at 20% per year, whereas two econometric\nmodels forecast 10% average growth per year. Also, considering the growth\nduring the last decade (3.4% on average), along with the recovery from the\nfinancial crisis, an annual increase of about 10% in the medium future seems\nreasonable. Given that the diagnostic test results are better for the WB-ECM\nthan the partial adjustment model, tourist arrivals from Malaysia are expected\nto rise to 2.77 million in 2010, as suggested by the WB-ECM.\nSingapore\nThe reduced ADLM presents a functional form that is consistent with the\npartial adjustment model, which is the only specific model that passes the\nrestriction tests (see Table 7). Due to its better performance judged by the\ndiagnostic tests, the reduced ADLM is employed for the ex ante forecasts. In\nthe reduced ADLM, apart from the income variable, all other variables are found\nto be statistically significant, including trade volume which does not display\nsignificance for any other origins. Regarding the Asian financial crisis, Singa-\npore is the only country to benefit from it in the tourism context, and this\nis confirmed by three out of four specific models. One possible reason for this\npositive impact on the demand for Thai tourism by Singaporeans is due to the\nmuch less severe devaluation of the Singapore dollar. One CI relationship is\ndetected and two ECMs are estimated, using the WB and JML methods. Both\nof the ECMs pass all the diagnostic tests.\nWith regard to the ex ante forecasts (Table 10), the JML-ECM comes out with\nan unreasonable downturn trend. This is in contrast to all the other models,\nwhere the results are quite similar. According to the reduced ADLM, it is likely\nthat tourist arrivals from Singapore will increase to 1.52 million in 2010.\nUK\nThe partial adjustment and dead start models are appropriate functional forms\nfor the UK data (see Table 8). The reduced ADLM indicates that income and\nsubstitute prices are the key determinants for UK tourism demand to Thailand.\nDUM97 also appears in the final reduced model with a negative sign, implying\nthat the Asian financial crisis had an adverse impact on UK tourism to this\ndestination (maybe even the whole region) in the early stages. Examination of\ntourist arrivals from the UK between 1996 and 1997 shows that, although\ntourist numbers kept increasing from 286,889 to 287,664, the growth rate\nslowed from 4.6% to 2.7%. It seems that although the devaluation caused a\nmore attractive tourism price, other negative factors played more important\nroles. For example, tourists might have worried more about political stability\nand personal security. With the development of the financial crisis the positive\nand negative factors tended to offset each other, so the overall influence was\nneutral in 1998. The CI test indicates two CI relationships, which are both\nTOURISM ECONOMICS384\ncorrectly signed, and therefore the corresponding two JML-ECMs are employed\nto generate ex ante forecasts, along with the WB-ECM.\nRegarding the ex ante forecasts (Table 10), all the models come out with\nforecasts that show an upward trend. Apart from the two JML-ECMs, which\nforecast average annual growth rates of 21\u201325%, the other four econometric\nmodels generate very close forecasts, with average annual growth rates in the\nrange 11\u201312%, and this is close to the historical rate over the last five years.\nThe reasonable predicted ranges for tourist arrivals based on these models are\nfrom 1.40 million to 1.46 million in 2010.\nUSA\nThe partial adjustment and dead start models are acceptable functional forms\nfor the USA, the same as in the cases of Australia and UK (see Table 9). In\nthe reduced ADLM, besides the lagged dependent variable, lagged own price\nand lagged trade volume are also significant at the 1% level. The reduced\nADLM coincides with the dead start specification. As for the one-off events,\nonly the second oil crisis is statistically significant, and this is supported by\nall the other specific models. Like most of the other origins, only one CI\nrelationship is traced. Since the impact of the Asian financial crisis is not\ndetected in the models, the data for estimation are taken from before 1995,\nand the ex post forecast performance is also checked. The results show that the\npartial adjustment model clearly exhibits the best ex post forecast performance.\nWhen the ex ante forecasts are investigated (Table 10), the JML-ECM de-\nscribes the most optimistic prospect, with 13.4% growth each year on average.\nBy contrast, the ARIMA model predicts most conservatively, with only 1%\ngrowth being achieved. The partial adjustment model, dead start model, re-\nduced ADLM and WB-ECM all generate forecast growth rates of around 4%,\nwhich is close to the average annual growth rate over the period 1990\u20132000.\nThe partial adjustment model generates the most accurate ex post forecasts, but\nhas some problems with diagnostic tests. The dead start model generates the\nnext most accurate ex post forecasts and is therefore used to forecast tourist\narrivals. The dead start model suggests that 722,000 tourist arrivals are expected\nin 2010.\nCompared with the ARIMA models, most of the econometric models predict\nmuch higher forecasts, especially in the Australian and Korean cases. The reason\nfor this is that the forecasts of the econometric models are influenced by both\nthe historical trend of the demand variable itself, but also by the predictions\nof the future trends of the influencing factors. The forecasts of the ARIMA\nmodels, however, are influenced only by the historical trend of the forecast\nvariable itself.\nSummary and conclusion\nThe demand for Thai tourism by seven major origin countries is analysed using\nthe general-to-specific modelling methodology. Various specific functional forms\nare examined in addition to the reduced ADLM, the Wickens\u2013Breusch ECM\nand the Johansen maximum likelihood ECM. The forecasting models are selected\nbased on a number of strict criteria including the goodness of fit, diagnostic\n385Modelling and forecasting Thai tourism demand\nstatistics and ex post forecasting ability. The empirical results in this study\nsuggest that the partial adjustment and dead start models are the most accept-\nable specific functional forms.\nWith regard to the reduced ADLM, habit persistence features in all the\nmodels except for Japan. Income is shown to be the key determinant in the\ncases of Australia, Korea and the UK. The own price and cross price variables\nplay important roles during the decision making process of residents from\nAustralia, Japan, Singapore and the UK. It should be noted that the sign of\ncoefficients for RSUBt in the Korean and USA models is different from that in\nthe other models, implying that neighbouring countries have played different\nroles when different origin countries are concerned. The negative sign suggests\nthat the neighbouring destinations are complementary to Thailand, while the\npositive sign indicates that the substitute effect is in force. This result has an\nimportant implication for Thailand\u2019s tourism pricing strategies.\nTrade volume turns out to be significant only in the cases of Singapore and\nthe USA, perhaps because of the relatively high proportion of business tourism\nfrom these two countries. With regard to one-off events, the first oil crisis had\na significant adverse impact in the Japan model, while the influence of the\nsecond oil crisis is significant in the Japan, Korea and USA models. The\ndirection of influence of the Asian financial crisis on tourism demand differs\nfrom origin to origin. Singapore seems to gain from the cheaper price due to\nthe relatively huge currency devaluation in Thailand, while Korea and the UK\nsuffer from the crisis. The impact took effect in Korea in 1997 and continued\ninto 1998. As for Singapore, a significant impact could be seen only in 1998,\nwhile in the case of the UK the effect was more evident at the beginning of\nthe crisis.\nWith regard to the ex ante forecasts, the ARIMA model always produces the\nmost modest prediction (with the exception of Singapore), while the JML-ECM\ntends to generate the most optimistic forecast. The most reliable forecast has\nbeen selected for each origin based on diagnostic tests, ex post forecasting\nperformance, consistency among forecast growth rates from the various models,\nand consistency with historical growth over the last five to ten years. It appears\nthat tourist arrivals from Korea will grow most rapidly among all the origin\ncountries, and that growth from the UK will be the slowest. The forecasts also\nshow that Korea and Malaysia will join Japan to become the largest tourism\nmarkets for Thailand by the end of this decade.\nSince rapid growth in tourist arrivals from such origin countries as Australia,\nJapan, Korea and the UK is predicted, it is important for Thailand to increase\nflight frequencies between major Thai cities and these countries. The improve-\nment of airport facilities and services in Thailand is also considered to be crucial\nfor attracting more tourists from these countries, particularly during the peak\nseasons. The Thai government should encourage greater private-sector involve-\nment, and especially investment in the development of tourism projects. Much\nattention should be paid to catering for the needs of Korean tourists, as Korea\nis predicted to be the fastest-growing market for Thailand. In addition, estab-\nlishing more travel agencies or organizing broader cooperation with local\nagencies in Korea would be beneficial for Thai tourism. Moreover, the com-\nplementary interplay between Thailand and its neighbouring countries in the\ncase of Korean and American tourists suggests that the development of joint\nTOURISM ECONOMICS386\ntouring programmes would increase tourism demand in Thailand as well as in\nthe neighbouring countries. However, the government should not ignore the\npossible negative impacts of speedy tourism expansion on the physical and social\nenvironments within Thailand.\nIt should be noted that, due to the terrorist attacks on the USA on 11\nSeptember 2001, and the war on Iraq and the SARS epidemic in 2003, the\ndemand for Thai tourism is likely to be affected. However, according to past\nexperience the impacts are likely to be short-lived, and a full recovery should\nbe achieved within the next two years (Louvieris, 2002). Therefore, the general\ntrends in the demand for Thai tourism predicted in this study are unlikely to\nbe affected much over the forecasting period.\nEndnotes\n1.

Raw data of tourist arrivals before 1978 were recorded only by nationality rather than by both\nnationality and residence as was the case afterwards. Since the latter is the proper measurement,\nand considering the high correlation between the two series, simple regression of tourist arrivals\nby residence against arrivals by nationality is used to estimate the missing data. In doing so,\nthe full data set of tourist arrivals by residence is obtained.\n8. The definition of the substitute price index follows that in the deduced demand equation of\nThomas (1993). It differs slightly from the substitute price index used in Song et al (2000),\nSong and Witt (2000) and Kulendran and Witt (2001), where it is measured by price in the\ndestination relative to that in competing destinations.\n9. Apart from those mentioned, some other origin-specific events may also have affected the\ndemand for Thai tourism. However, due to the restriction of degrees of freedom, they were not\nincluded.\nReferences\nBreusch, T.
