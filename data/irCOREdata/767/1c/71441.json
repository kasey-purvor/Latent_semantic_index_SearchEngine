Seymour*\nSchool of Law, Lancaster\nAbstract\nThis essay argues that the more the state or the political is treated as autonomous the more the specific\nconception and history of Jews dissolves into a universalised and universalistic category. From this\nperspective, the emancipatory rights granted to Jews appear as exercises of an arbitrary sovereign\npower rather than the product and compromises of diverse interests in which Jews are present. This\nthesis is articulated through a discussion and comparison of two anti-emancipationist radical thinkers;\nBruno Bauer and Girogio Agambem.Where Bauer demands the Jews\u2019 emancipation from Judaism as\na precondition for the granting of rights, Agamben dissolves the specific Jewish dimension of the\nHolocaust into a universalist notion of domination and the figure of the Musselman. I conclude by\nnoting that, in the wake of this dissolution, any reference to Jewish specificity, even in death, can be\ninterpreted as the Jews demanding \u2018special privileges\u2019 over and above others, thereby running the risk\nof the Holocaust taking its place in the chain of the antisemitic imagination.\nThis essay argues that the more the state is treated as an autonomous entity, the more the specific\nconception of the Jews dissolves into a universalised and universalistic category. The consequence of\nthis relationship is that any notion of Jewish specificity is undermined and is replaced instead by the\nlanguage of \u2018special pleading\u2019 or \u2018special privileges\u2019; that is, to quote Hal Draper, replaced by the\nlanguage of \u2018wooden sectarianism\u2019 (Draper, 1977, p. 113).\nSince this relationship between the autonomy of the state and the dissolution of the Jews turns\non an increasingly nihilistic attitude toward modern political emancipation, this essay offers not\nonly a critical defence of such emancipation, but also of the juridical rights through which that\nemancipation was realised. On this point, I argue that in treating the state or the political as an\nautonomous entity, rights are seen as always provisional, not in the sense that they can be rescinded\n(history offers ample examples of such rescission), but that their application to Jews is dependent not\nupon the Jews themselves (in the sense of their place and location in the world), but upon the\nconditional grace of others.\nA current theme in critical legal and critical political literature is a renewed focus on \u2018the\npolitical\u2019 as the foundation of the contemporary world.1 It is for this reason that so much attention\nis paid to a reconsideration of the French Revolution and its aftermath (Zizek, 2007, pp. vii\u2013xlii). In\nthe past the emancipatory aspects of the Revolution hid the reality of terror that accompanied it;\nnow, the inverse is the case; the rights of man inaugurated by the Revolution are now subsumed\nand reduced to an aspect of the terror. For some thinkers of this view, rights in particular and law in\ngeneral are nothing other than violence and, as such, are not so much part of the answer as part of the\nproblem.\n* School of Law, Lancaster, LA1 4YN.

Then as\nnow, the error was to believe that the autonomy and universality of the state must be understood in\nterms that excluded and dominated any particularist input. To put the matter in the language of\nHegel and Marx, the universality of the state sought to impose itself on the particularism of civil\nsociety.2 Speaking with special reference to the question of religion, Marx notes the following:\n\u2018Of course, in periods when the political state as such is born violently out of civil society, when\npolitical liberation is the form in which men strive to achieve their liberation, the state can and\nmust go as far as the abolition of religion, the destruction of religion. But it can do so only in the same\nway that it proceeds to the abolition of private property, to the maximum, to confiscation, to\nprogressive taxation, just as it goes as far as the abolition of life, the guillotine. At times of special self-\nconfidence, political life seeks to suppress its prerequisite, civil society and the elements composing\nthis society, and to constitute itself as the real species-life of man, devoid of contradictions. But it\ncan achieve this only by coming into violent contradiction with its own conditions of life, only by\ndeclaring the revolution to be permanent, and, therefore, the political drama necessarily ends with\nthe re-establishment of religion, private property, and all elements of civil society, just as war ends\nwith peace.\u2019 (Marx, 1992a)\nNowhere are these points more in evidence than in the question of Jewish emancipation and the rights\nthrough which it is expressed. Even in Bauer\u2019s and Agamben\u2019s very different accounts of Jewish\nemancipation, we see the \u2018Jewish question\u2019 through the prism of the autonomy of the political. Both\nBauer and Agamben present juridical rights of emancipation as conditional upon a political decision. It\nis for this reason that I have chosen the work of two seemingly disparate thinkers, one writing at the\ndawn of modernity and that other at a possibly prematurely proclaimed dusk.\nSince this political sovereignty acts, and can only act, in the name of the universal, the condition\nof emancipation becomes infused with a dependence on the criterion of universality. It denies the\nexistence of particularities which, in this case, includes the history and presence of actually existing,\nflesh-and-blood, Jews. It is for this reason, therefore, that in both Bauer and Agamben, Jewish emancipa-\ntion is presented, and can only be presented, in terms of the Jews dissolution as Jews in the name of an\noverarching political universalism. The terror that the universal wreaks on the particular in general\nbecomes, for both theory and theorist of Jewish emancipation, the terror of the autonomy of the state\nand the dissolution of the Jews.\nI\nPerhaps the most notorious case in which the autonomy of the state was said to demand the\ndissolution of Judaism and the Jews was that advanced by the Berlin \u2018left\u2019 Hegelian Bruno Bauer\n(Carlebach, 1978).\nBy the time of Bauer\u2019s contribution in the early 1840s, the \u2018Jewish question\u20193 had been simmering\nin Germany for well over three-quarters of a century. The broader context of Bauer\u2019s contributionwas\nthe important overturning of emancipatory gains that were made prior to theWars of Liberation and\nwere set in motion during the ensuing years of Reaction (Carlebach 1978; Draper, 1977)4. This\n2 See Karl Marx, 1992a, 1992b.\n3 At this period, the \u2018Jewish question\u2019 turned on whether and on what terms Jews can, should or should not be\nemancipated from the political and social constraints imposed upon them.\n4 For a list of decrees and the matters covered, see Carlebach, 1978, p. 59.\nDAVID M. SEYMOUR374\ngradual erosion was not only opposed by sections of the various Jewish communities in Germany,\nbut also by the liberal industrialists of the more progressive urban areas.\nThe late 1830s and early 1840s also saw the ascendancy to the throne of FriedrichWilhelm IV andhis\napproach to this question. Despite early hopes, FriedrichWilhelm IV\u2019s policy on the Jewish question can\nbest be described, literally and politically, as \u2018reactionary\u2019. According to Carlebach, the new monarch:\n\u2018[L]onged for a full restoration of the traditional estates in Prussia, for the revitalisation of the\nnobility and for a greatly strengthened Church to give meaning and substance to his cherished\nfaith in Prussia as a great \u2018\u2018Christian-Germanic\u2019\u2019 state, a Prussiamodelled on the Christian Stadestaat\nas advocated by Karl Ludwig von Haller.\u2019 (Carlebach, 1978, p. 66)\nWith this overall outlook, Friedrich Wilhelm commissioned a draft law on the subject which\n\u2018advocated nothing less than a return to the middle ages\u2019 (ibid., p. 68), whereby Jews would be reduced\nto the status akin to that of a feudal \u2018corporation\u2019 which, in the words of the bill, would entail:\n\u2018Excluding Jews from military service and, self-evidently, from offices and positions of honour\nfor ever, and generally to keep Jews and Judaism totally outside the state.\u2019 (cited in Carlebach,\n1978, p. 68)\nIt was this draft bill and the discussions that ensued that provided the immediate context for Bruno\nBauer\u2019s reflections on the subject.5\nWhat is important about Bauer\u2019s argument, and the reason why Marx felt called upon to\nchallenge it, was that it came, not from the conservative right, but, seemingly, from the critical left\n(Draper, 1977).6 As will become apparent, however, although Bauer did not hesitate to utilise the\nChristian right\u2019s arguments for his own, it was his belief that Jewish emancipation, or the continued\nexistence of Jews as Jews, was incompatible with what he took to be the nature of emancipation.\nBauer\u2019s polemic against Jewish emancipation was aimed not only against their inclusion within\nthe contemporaneous German Christian state, but also within the modern, politically emancipated\nsecular state. Bauer argued that since Christianity and Judaism related to each other in a state of\ntheological antagonism, a state organised on the principles of Christianity had every right, if not the\nduty, not only to exclude the Jews, but to keep them in the most humiliating and servile uneman-\ncipated conditions. Adding insult to injury, Bauer argued that since all forms of religion are the\nsignature of unfreedom, in a Christian state, no one is \u2018truly free\u2019, not even those who benefit from the\ncorrespondence between their own and the state religion. The demand of the Jews for their emancipa-\ntion, is, in effect, a demand for special consideration.\n\u2018Everybody is unfree in an absolute monarchy. The Jew is only unfree in a particular manner. The\nhope and wish of the Jew should not be for the removal of his special misery but for the downfall\nof a principle.\u2019 (Draper, 1977, p. 113)\nIn the face of this universal oppression, therefore, all gradation of oppression, indeed, of the division\nof the oppressed into a subcategory of oppressor and oppressed is ignored.\nWhere Bauer broke new ground, however, was in his argument against the Jews\u2019 emancipation as\nJews into themodern, politically emancipated, secular state. To be permitted to enter this state, Bauer\navers, entails that the Jews emancipate themselves from Judaism.\n5 Bruno Bauer was a prolific contributor to the current affairs of his day even if, as a radical, his writings were\noften heavily censored. The state was willing to make an exception on matters concerning the Jews\n(Carlebach, 1978).\n6 Carlebach (1978) argues that many radicals, and not only Bauer, managed to escape the usual censorship of\ntheir views on themonarchy and the state, through expressing their criticism as a commentary on the \u2018Jewish\nquestion\u2019.\nTHE AUTONOMY OF THE POLITICAL AND THE DISSOLUTION OF THE JEWS 375\nTo justify this aspect of his counter-emancipationist thesis, Bauer argues that the mark of the\nmodern emancipated state is its emancipation from religion. As a consequence of this religious\nemancipation, only those individuals who have shed the shackles of religion can be permitted into\nits secularly hallowed halls. On this count, again, the Jews as Jews are barred. Moreover, since the\nsecular state emerged out of the skin of the Christian state, it is not enough any more for the Jews to\nbecome Christian, but, rather, theymust adopt the \u2018later\u2019 stage of \u2018Christianity in dissolution\u2019 (quoted\nin Marx, 1992a).\nTo appreciate this point fully, it is necessary to say a few words concerning the thinking that\nunderpins Bauer\u2019s argument. Drawing on the critical theology of the Young Hegelians (most notably,\nDavid Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach; seeMcLellan, 1969), Bauer sought to uncover the \u2018human\u2019 basis of\nreligion.His ownparticular take on this basiswaswhat he took to be the teleology of \u2018self-consciousness\u2019.\nThemove from Judaism toChristianity to secularism is themove froma lack of awareness of humanity\u2019s\ncreative powers to its full realisation that the world is, in fact, its own creation. That it has taken place\ninitially through religious forms is itself a symptom of self-consciousness\u2019 lack of confidence.\nFrom what has been said up to this point, it is hardly surprising to note the stages in this\nteleology and the place Bauer allocates to Judaism within it. Judaism, Bauer argues, lacks any\nconception of self-consciousness at all. Rather, it is the religion of unreflective nature:\n\u2018One of the various ways of strengthening the spirit of the Jewish people was the hierarchy, the caste\nsystem. The hierarchy exists wherever the spirit of the people is incapable \u2013 for lack of force,\nliberality, or religious abilities \u2013 of activating all the limbs of the folk. . . . It is the religious duty of the\nJew, as Jew, to belong to a family, a tribe, a nation, i.e. to live for the sake of certain human interests;\nbut it is only in a seeming advantage, based on a deficiency. Man in his universal essence, man as a\nmember of a family, tribe or nation was still unknown to Judaism.\u2019 (Rosen, 1977, pp. 86\u201387)\nIn overcoming Judaism, Christianity exhibits a self-consciousness of \u2018man\u2019s universal essence\u2019 in a\nway unknown to Judaism. Christianity\u2019s universality arises, according to Bauer, by absorbing into\nitself the entirety of humanity\u2019s awareness of itself as the power of creation. Christianity embodies the\nawareness of humanity\u2019s separation from nature (as well as its power over it (Horkheimer and Adorno,\n2002), but does so in a distorted or inverse manner. At this stage in the story, self-consciousness lacks\nthe strength and will to comprehend fully the consequences of this awareness. Instead, it makes its\nappearance through the theology of Christianity in which all humanity\u2019s creative energies are placed\nand through which real men and women are correspondingly devalued. As such \u2018empty\u2019 beings,\nhumanity cannot but see themselves as the playthings of an external, eternal and omnipotent God.\nThe political corollary of this awareness is the destruction of the Christian state and the establish-\nment of the religiously emancipated political state. As its terminology implies, the Christian state\nmirrors the relationship of God to humanity in its theological appearance. The state appears to be\neverything and its subjects nothing:\n\u2018The Christian state is guided by the dictates of religion, it suppresses all manifestations of free\nand autonomous thoughts, leads to the banishing of the spirit, lulls all the predilections and\naspirations of mankind, is guilty of causing crime, etc.\u2019 (Rosen, 1977, p. 116)\nIt is only when \u2018the people\u2019 are brought to the truth of their situation that they can inaugurate the era\nof \u2018true freedom\u2019 through which self-consciousness becomes aware of itself as the driving spirit of\nworld history.\nIt follows, therefore, that for Bauer, the destruction of religion and the destruction of the Christian\nstate are one and the same thing. It is as a consequence of this set of beliefs that Bauer believes that the\nemancipated state, in which religion is no longer either a bar or entry into the state, is identical with\nhumanity\u2019s emancipation from religion per se. Those people who are still persuaded by the shackles of\nreligion need not apply for entry.\nDAVID M. SEYMOUR376\nIt is within this theoretical context of emancipation that Bauer locates the \u2018origins\u2019 andmeaning of\njuridical rights and, in so doing, denies their applicability to Jews. Since \u2018the universal rights of man\u2019\nare the expression of the developed self-consciousness, and since the Jews have remained outside that\ndevelopment, they cannot expect to share in its fruits. Indeed, as long as they remain Jews, they remain\noutside the realm of \u2018the universal\u2019. Marx quotes Bauer at length on this point:\n\u2018The question is whether the Jew as such, that is, the Jewwho himself admits that he is compelled\nby his true nature to live permanently in separation from other men, is capable of receiving the\nuniversal rights of man and of conceding them to others.\nFor the Christian world, the idea of the rights of man was only discovered in the last century. It\nis not innate in man; on the contrary, it is gained only in a struggle against the historical\ntraditions in which hitherto man was brought up. Thus, the rights of man are not the gift of\nnature, nor a legacy of past history, but the reward of the struggle against the accident of birth\nand against the privileges which up to now have been handed down by history from generation\nto generation. These rights are the result of culture, and only one who has, and only one who has\nearned and deserved them can possess them.\nCan the Jew really take possession of them? As long as he is a Jew, the restricted nature which\nmakes him a Jew is bound to triumph over the human nature which should link him as a man\nwith other men, and will separate him from non-Jews. He declares by this separation that the\nparticular nature which makes him a Jew is his true highest nature, before which human nature\nhas to give way.\u2019 (Marx, 1992a)\nNot only are Jews barred from \u2018the universal rights of man\u2019 because of their restricted nature brought\nabout by their exclusion from the history of self-consciousness, but to argue for rights and emancipa-\ntion as Jews would again be to claim \u2018priority treatment\u2019. If humanity\u2019s emancipation from religion is\nsynonymous with the state\u2019s emancipation from religion, why should the Jews be made an exception?\nFrom Bauer\u2019s point of view, the very fact that the Jews are seeking emancipation as Jews can be read as a\nreflection of their innate particularist and narrow \u2018nature\u2019, one that is divorced from \u2018universal\nhumanity\u2019. To be granted (and to grant) emancipation, therefore, the Jews have no option but to\ndissolve themselves into that general universality; to become \u2018human\u2019 at the expense of being Jewish.\nLeaving aside Bauer\u2019s personal anti-Jewish animosity (Carlebach, 1978), the question remains as\nto why he got it so wrong. The answer to this question, I believe, is a consequence of his overarching\ntheoretical thinking and the application of that thought to the question of political emancipation\nand legal rights. In short, it exhibits a correlation between the autonomy of the theorist and the\nautonomy of the state or \u2018political\u2019.\nAt the core of this problem is Bauer\u2019s notion of \u2018criticism\u2019 or \u2018pure criticism\u2019. As Rosen makes clear,\nBauer\u2019s criticism is \u2018absolute\u2019. It is absolute in the sense that it posits \u2018spirit\u2019 (of which self-consciousness\nis the specific expression) against reality, i.e. the actually existing world. Reality is treated by Bauer\nas, \u2018the illusory existence of man in a society in which the conventional falsehood of ideology\nand \u2018\u2018religiosity\u2019\u2019 reigns as the preferred status of various groups\u2019 (Rosen, 1977, p. 231). What Bauer\nmeans by this phrase, of course, is that \u2018reality\u2019 is \u2018self-consciousness\u2019 and religious forms (i.e. self-\nconsciousness\u2019s earthly appearance) mere illusion. Marx pre\u00b4cised this relationship in The Holy Family:\n\u2018On one side stand the mass as the passive, spiritless, historyless, material element of history; on\nthe other side stands the Spirit, the Criticism \u2013 Herr Bruno and Co as the active element which all\nhistorical action proceeds. The act of social transformation is reduced to the brain activity of\nCritical Criticism.\u2019 (quoted in Rosen, 1977, p. 226)\nThis prioritising and separation of idealism over materialism (which, paradoxically, is precisely of\nwhat Bauer had accused Christianity) has vast consequences when placed in relation to the question\nof Jewish emancipation in general and the question of rights in particular.\nTHE AUTONOMY OF THE POLITICAL AND THE DISSOLUTION OF THE JEWS 377\nAmongst the more specific criticisms Marx (Rosen, 1977) made of Bauer\u2019s \u2018absolutist\u2019 standpoint\ntwo, when taken together, are of special significance in the present context. These criticisms are, first,\nthe fact that the present is seen as the product of a past battle of ideas \u2018devoid from anymaterial basis\u2019\n(Rosen, 1977, p.236). In this exclusion from the \u2018arena of real events\u2019, and this is the second point, the\nrealm of ideas triumphs over the realm of interests.\nIt is not the case that Bauer believes merely in the primacy and perspective of ideas over\nmateriality as the basis for \u2018criticism\u2019, but he also believes that the purer the separation, the purer\nand more valid the criticism. It is because \u2018[t]he Critical Truth addresses itself not to the empirical man\nbut to the \u2018\u2018innermost depths of the soul\u2019\u2019\u2019 that social interestswill have an negative impact on the purity of\nideas. Bauer makes this point clear in his discussion of the shortcomings of the French Revolution:\n\u2018All great actions of previous history . . . were failures from the start and had no marked success\nbecause the mass became interested in and enthusiastic over them; in other words, they were\nbound to come to a pitiful end because the idea involved in them [was] such that it had to be\nsatisfied with a superficial conception and, therefore, had to rely upon the approval of the\nmass.\u2019 (quoted in Draper, 1977, p. 223)\nIt is in his earlier response to Bauer\u2019s anti-emancipationist argument that Marx presents the matter\nnot only from the side of interest, but also from its inclusion in the side of idea. This alternative\napproach to the Jewish question is apparent immediately in Marx\u2019s rejection of the concept of the\n\u2018Sabbath Jew\u2019 for that of the \u2018Everyday Jew\u2019:\n\u2018Let us consider the actual, worldly Jew \u2013 not the Sabbath Jew as Bauer does, but the everyday Jew.\nLet us not look for the secret of the Jew in his religion, but let us look for the secret of his\nreligion in the real Jew.\nWhat is the secular basis of Judaism? Practical need, self-interest. What is the worldly religion of\nthe Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money.\nVery well, then! Emancipation from huckstering and money, consequently, from practical, real\nJudaism, would be the self-emancipation of our time. (Marx, 1992a)\nWhat is of note here is not only Marx\u2019s recognition of the social interest of the Jews, but also its\nplacement in a material historical development.\nIt is because of Marx\u2019s insistence on the Jews\u2019 material rather than idealist existence that he can\ndispense with the teleological \u2018overcoming\u2019 of \u2018the Jew\u2019 that Bauer sees in the unfolding of \u2018self-\nconsciousness\u2019. By recognising the Jews\u2019 social existence upon whichMarx rests his analysis of rights\nand, ultimately, their emancipation. Marx makes these points overt, \u2018Judaism continues to exist not\nin spite of history, but owing to history\u2019:\n\u2018Judaism has held its own alongside Christianity, not only as religious criticism of Christianity,\nnot only as the embodiment of doubt in the religious derivation of Christianity, but equally,\nbecause the practical Jewish spirit, Judaism, has maintained itself and even attained its highest\ndevelopment in Christian society.\u2019 (Marx, 1992a)\nIn speaking of \u2018the practical Jewish spirit\u2019, Marx is pointing to Judaism\u2019s historical role in satisfying the\nneeds and wants of earthly, as opposed to spiritual, \u2018man\u2019. Or, in Bauer\u2019s terms, remaining close to the\nnature disavowed and degraded by Christianity:\n\u2018The Christian was from the very beginning the theorising Jew. The Jew is therefore the practical\nChristian and the practical Christian has once again become a Jew. . . . Christianity overcame real\nJudaism only in appearance. It was too refined, too spiritual, to do away with the crudeness of\npractical need except by raising it into celestial space . . . Christianity is the sublime thought of\nJudaism and Judaism the vulgar application of Christianity. But the application could not become\nuniversal until Christianity as perfected religion had theoretically completed the self-estrangement\nDAVID M. SEYMOUR378\nof man from himself and from nature . . . Only then could Judaism attain universal domination\nand turn alienated man and alienated nature into alienable, saleable objects subject to the slavery\nof egoistic need and to the market.\u2019 (Marx 1992a, pp. 240, 241)\nThe Jews, in other words, have not only always been part of history, they had an important role to\nplay in the development of the modern world. It was a role that in serving their own, particular, i.e.\nself-, interest, has served the universal interest.\nTurning to the question of \u2018universal rights\u2019, the so-called \u2018rights of man\u2019, Marx is again explicit\nas to their origin, meaning and significance. Far from excluding the Jews on the ground of their \u2018self-\ninterest\u2019, i.e. their particularism, Marx shows how it is precisely that particularist interest that is\nprotected by those rights. He analyses the post-Revolutionary constitutions of France and North\nAmerica, then argues that, since the rights of man are, in effect, the right of private property:\n\u2018None of the so-called rights of man, therefore, go beyond egoistic man, beyondman as a member\nof civil society \u2013 that is, an individual withdrawn into himself, into the confines of his private\ninterests and private caprice, and separated from the community. In the rights of man, he is far\nfrom being conceived as a species-being; on the contrary, species-like itself, society appears as a\nframework external to the individuals, as a restriction of their original independence. The sole\nbond holding them together is natural necessity, need and private interest, the preservation of their property\nand their egoistic selves.\u2019 (Marx, 1992a)\nLike the Jews, or, rather, the \u2018everyday Jews\u2019, so rights are the product of material, historically\ndeveloped interests, in this instance, the interests of private property. They are nothing other than\nexpressions of the nature and content of civil society. Far from the external connection between\nrights and spirit made by Bauer, and through which it is left to Bauer as the omnipotent sovereign\nand legislator of \u2018self-consciousness\u2019 to decide to include or exclude, Marx highlights its internal\nconnections. In doing so, he has shown that far from history and interests being grounds for refusal,\nthey are, in fact, the very basis and justification of inclusion.\nWhat the review of this debate has shown is the connection between the position of the critic and\nthe position of the state and the relationship of each \u2013 or seeming lack of relationship \u2013 to the body politic\nwithin which each is embedded; the more autonomous the critic and the more autonomous the state,\nthe more provisional the rights and inclusion of the Jews. The more, theoretically and practically, the\nJews become dependent on power, the more insecure they are and vulnerable to the whim of the\ntheorist and the state. It is to a more recent account of Jewish emancipation, that we will now turn.\nII\nIf Bauer\u2019s account of emancipation emphasised \u2018spirit\u2019 over materiality, Giorgio Agamben\u2019s work\nemphasises materiality over spirit; or, rather, \u2018humanness\u2019 over spirit. What is interesting is that\nwhichever side of the humanity\/spirit duality is emphasised the result is the same \u2013 the dissolution\nof the Jews and the \u2018Jewish question\u2019 into a generalised and universalised stream of history. As will\nalso become apparent, the cause of this replication again is the refusal to acknowledge the porous\nnature of the state.\nUnlike Bauer\u2019s (at least initial) acceptance of the French Revolution, Giorgio Agamben\u2019s work can\nbe situated within the broad church of the critical counter-Revolutionary tradition, stretching as far\nback as the enigmatic discourses of Joseph de Maistre.7 As Zizek notes in his introduction to the\nspeeches of Robespierre:\n7 That Agamben can be placed in this tradition is supported also by a perusal of those whom he cites with\napproval, from Chateaubraind, through Schmitt, through Saint Bonnet and others; see Lively, 1965. (For an\nalternative reading of this tradition, see Mouffe, 1993.)\nTHE AUTONOMY OF THE POLITICAL AND THE DISSOLUTION OF THE JEWS 379\n\u2018The identifying mark of all kinds of conservatives is its flat rejection: the French Revolution was a\ncatastrophe from its very beginning, the product of the godless modernmind; it is to be interpreted\nas God\u2019s punishment for humanity\u2019s wicked ways, so its traces should be done as thoroughly as\npossible. (Zizek, 2007, p. vii)\nAgamben\u2019s thought combines two of the most important elements of this tradition. The first is a\ncomplete rejection of the French Revolution through the idea that emancipation is nothing but\ndomination through the universalisation of terror. The second is inherent within the first. It is the\nidea that these events banishedGod and spirit from the profaneworld leaving humanity to the arbitrary\nvagaries of man\u2019s unfettered hubristic powers8. These two elements are combined and given effect in\nAgamben\u2019s conception of \u2018the political\u2019 as biopolitics in general and his account of Nazism in particular.\nIt is interesting to note, however, that despite the vast theoretical gulf that separates Bauer\u2019s thought\n(and its Rousseauian framework), from Agamben\u2019s (who, as noted, is heir to Rousseau\u2019s self-appointed\nnemesis, de Maistre), the outcome of the dissolution of the Jewish aspect of the Holocaust into a\nuniversalist conception of the state\u2019s autonomy remains the same.\nWhereas for Bauer, emancipation is treated as leading to individual autonomy as expressed\nthrough (abstract) juridical rights, for Agamben, emancipation is treated in the framework of abstract\ndomination of the natural and the nation. At the heart of this distinction is an unresolved tension\nwithin the modern notion of emancipation itself. For Bauer, the rights that express emancipation are\nseen as developing from the idealism of religion and culminate in the consciousness of the self, that\nis, of the individual. For Agamben, on the other hand, emancipation is placed within the context of the\nemancipation of \u2018the people\u2019, \u2018peoples\u2019 or nation. Within this context, \u2018individual\u2019 rights come to be\nmediated, or rather, granted, through the prism of the (modern) nation. In other words, if, for Bauer,\nrights originate from the side of religion (i.e. the emancipation of self-consciousness from its religious\nforms, most notably that of (the individualism of) Christianity), for Agamben, rights emerge from the\nsuccessful outcome of humanism through a conflict or contestation with religion, or at least, with the\nmystery of religion.\nFor Agamben what distinguishes the modern body politic from its pre-modern predecessor is not\nMarx\u2019s and Arendt\u2019s dichotomy between state and civil society, but the subsumption of the oikos\n(understood, not without difficulty, as the previously excluded realm of nature (or mortality and\nnatality; i.e. bare life; Agamben, 1995) into \u2018the political\u2019. As he states:\n\u2018[T]he entry of zoe into the sphere of the polis \u2013 the politicization of bare life itself \u2013 constitutes the\ndecisive event of modernity and signals a radical transformation of the political-philosophical\ncategories of classical thought. It is even likely that if politics today seems to be passing through\na lasting eclipse, this is because politics has failed to reckon with this foundational event of\nmodernity.\u2019 (Agamben,1995, p. 4)\nThis inclusion is symptomatic of an approach that highlights the alleged autonomy of the state. It is\nworth noting that Agamben\u2019s architecture rests upon an explanation of modernity that relies upon\nconcepts of classical political philosophy; a point present in Marx\u2019s critique of the terror of the\nRevolution.9 However, rather than overcoming this classical distinction between the political and\noikos, Agamben utilises it for his novel approach to emancipation and the rights through which it is\nexpressed. It is to be noted also that this reference and utilisation of classical thought as applicable to\n8 \u2018Or it can retain the conjunction \u2018\u2018humanism and terror\u2019\u2019, but in a negative mode: all those philosophical and\nideological orientations, from Heidegger and conservative Christians to partisans of Oriental spirituality and\ndeep ecology, who perceive terror as the truth \u2013 the ultimate consequence \u2013 of the humanist project itself, of\nits hubris\u2019\u2019 (Zizek, 2007, p. xiii).\n9 Marx has argued that part of the reason for the Jacobin terror was their confusion between the contempora-\nneous situation and that of the classical world.\nDAVID M. SEYMOUR380\nthe modern world permits Agamben to utilise not only classical political concepts, but also classical\nlegal concepts. Most notable amongst these is the juridical (and theological) concept of homo sacer, of\none who could be killed but not sacrificed.\nIt is through this meaning of emancipation and the rights connected with it, that Agamben\u2019s\nthought connects with Foucault\u2019s later work (see, for example, Foucault, 2005). Drawing on Foucault\u2019s\npremise of \u2018biopolitics\u2019 \u2013 that the central concern facing the nationwas articulated through the language\nof health and contagion and the need for a \u2018healthy population\u2019 \u2013 Agamben offers an account that places\nit as the central concern and meaning of emancipation which, in turn, is treated as becoming the sole\ncontent and mark of political (i.e. state) sovereignty.\nCorrespondingly, since Agamben rests his definition of the state on the Schmittian conception of\nsovereignty through which \u2018he is sovereign who decides on the exception\u2019 (Schmitt, 2005), Agamben\ntreats this sovereign power, most notably \u2018the state of the exception\u2019 in purely biopolitical terms.\nRead in this light, therefore, emancipation and rights become nothing other than expressions of this\nbiopolitical concern with the health of the nation. It is in this way, therefore, that emancipation and\nthe right to inclusion (as well as the fate of exclusion) becomes imbricated in the praxis of biopolitics.\nIt is this overarching biopolitical concern that gives rise to the obsession with the life and health\nof the nation. Agamben expresses this obsession through his argument that the distinguishing mark\nof the modern, emancipated nation-state is its concern with \u2018bare life\u2019. As he states:\n\u2018The same bare life that in the ancien regime was politically neutral and belonged to God as\ncreaturely life and in the classical world was (at least apparently) clearly extinguished as Zoe\u00a8 from\npolitical life (bios) now full enters into the state\u2019s legitimacy and sovereignty.\u2019 (1998, p. 127)\nThrough this prism of humanist biopolitics, Agamben accounts for the meaning and substance of\njuridical rights and their conflation of the political and the \u2018natural\u2019:\n\u2018Declarations of rights represent the originary figure of the inscription of natural life in the juridico-\npolitical order of the nation-state . . . The fiction here is that birth immediately becomes nation such that\nthere can be no interval or separation [scarto] between the two terms. Rights are attributed to man (or\noriginate in him) solely to the extent that man is the immediately vanishing ground (who must\nnever come to light as such) of the citizen.\u2019 (1995, pp. 127\u201328, emphasis added)\nIt is important to note, however, that this biopolitical concern is not merely applied to an already\nexistent national population, but, rather, is inscribed within the body or make-up of the person\nitself:\n\u2018The link between politics and life . . . is not (as is maintained by a common and completely\ninadequate interpretation of racism) merely an instrumental relationship, as if race were a simple\nnatural given that hadmerely to be safeguarded. The novelty of modern biopolitics lies in the fact that the\nbiologically given is as such immediately political, and the political is as such immediately biologically given.\u2019\n(1995, pp. 147\u201348, emphasis added)\nTherefore, rather than confronting an external, \u2018objective\u2019 population, biopolitics believes itself capable\nof creating that national population in its own (humanist) image. Indeed, as just noted, the moment of\ncreation and the moment of evaluation is a decision not so much located in the realm of the political,\nbut is its very definition.\nThis definition of the political \u2013 biopolitics \u2013 then comes to the fore in the very nature of sovereignty:\nthe state of exception. Agamben traces the origin of the state of exception to Revolutionary France and,\njust as de Maistre universalises and reifies the \u2018reign of terror\u2019, Agamben universalises and reifies the\n\u2018moment\u2019 of the \u2018state of siege\u2019 or \u2018state of exception\u2019. Put briefly, the state of exception is the sovereign\npower to suspend the constitution for the sake of its protection. At these moments, the diversity of state\npowers \u2013 i.e. the separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judiciary \u2013mergewithin the\nTHE AUTONOMY OF THE POLITICAL AND THE DISSOLUTION OF THE JEWS 381\nsingularity of an absolute sovereign power. More specifically for present purposes, is the immediacy or\nfusion between political power and bare life:\n\u2018It is in this no-man\u2019s land between public law and political fact, and between the juridical order\nand life, that [State of Exception] seeks to investigate. Only if the veil covering this ambiguous zone is\nlifted will we be able to approach an understanding of the stakes involved in the difference \u2013 or the\nsupposed difference \u2013 between the political and the juridical, between law and the living being.\u2019\n(Agamben, 2005, pp. 1\u20132)\nCorrespondingly, the state of exception, standing as it does at the threshold of juridical and extra\njuridical power, melds the two to such an extent that, as Agamben phrases it:\n\u2018The state of exception thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual\ndanger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself.\u2019 (1995, p. 168)\nFused into one through the state of exception, the biopolitics that was the mark of emancipation\nnow shows itself as domination. This point comes to the fore in the connection Agamben makes\nbetween the state of exception and \u2018the camp\u2019.\nIf, in Agamben\u2019s thought, the state of exception comes to represent the bounded autonomy of the\nabsolutism of the political, it is \u2018the camp\u2019 that is its topographical manifestation.10 Just as the state of\nexception, along with its biopolitical content, exists at the interstices of the separation of powers, the\ncamp exists at the interstices of political geography. Tracing the intimate connection between the\nnature of the camps with the nature of the state of exception, Agamben concludes:\n\u2018The camp is the space that is opened when the state of exception begins to become the rule. In the camp,\nthe state of exception, which was essentially a temporary suspension of the rule of law on the\nbasis of a factual state of danger, is now given a permanent spatial arrangement, which as such\nremains outside the normal order.\u2019 (1995, p. 169)\nA consistent theme throughout Agamben\u2019s work on this issue is the idea that Nazism and the Third\nReich that existed between 1933 and 1945 be understood as a \u2018paradigm\u2019 of modern biopolitics and\nthe state of exception. It expresses the totalitarianism that he believes is present within everymodern\ndemocracy and which, as noted, originated in the French Revolution. For example, in the State of\nException, Agamben argues:\n\u2018Let us take the case of the Nazi State [sic]. No sooner did Hitler take power (or, as we should\nperhaps more accurately say, no sooner was power given to him) than, on February 28, he\nproclaimed the Decree of the Protection of the People and the State, which suspended the articles\nof theWeimer Constitution concerning personal liberties. The decree was never repealed, so that\nfrom a juridical standpoint, the entire Third Reich can be considered a state of exception that\nlasted twelve years. In this sense, modern totalitarianism can be defined as the establishment, by\nmeans of the state of exception, of a legal civil war that allows for the physical elimination not\nonly of political adversaries but of entire categories of citizens who for some reason cannot be\nintegrated into the political system.\u2019 (2005, p. 2)\nIt is within this notion of the Third Reich as a state of exception that Agamben is able to locate the\nspecificity of the Nazi camps; that is, as an institution operating at the interstices of politics, law and\nbare life:\n\u2018WhenHimmler decided to create a \u2018\u2018concentration camp for political prisoners\u2019\u2019 in Dachau at the\ntime of Hitler\u2019s election as Chancellor of the Reich in March 1933, the camp was immediately\n10 For a critique of Agamben\u2019s concept of \u2018the camp\u2019 see, Mesnard, 2004.\nDAVID M. SEYMOUR382\nentrusted to the SS and \u2013 thanks to Sutzhaft \u2013 placed outside the rules of penal and prison law,\nwhich then, subsequently, had no bearing in it.\u2019 (Agamben, 1995, p. 169)\nAs noted above, sealed within the autonomous bubble of the political, the camp is the location of the\nimmediacy of the state of exception and its biopolitical content. All mediations are cancelled in the\ncamp. In the case of Nazism, along with the fusion of law and power, fact and application of rule,\nexception and norm, inclusion and exclusion, is the biopolitical (national) distinction between Jew\nand Aryan. The camp is also the threshold (although Agamben does not phrase it this way) of the\nprofane and the divine:\n\u2018The camp is the space of this absolute impossibility of deciding between fact and law, rule and\napplication, exception and rule, which nevertheless incessantly decides between them. What con-\nfronts the guard or the camp official is not an extrajuridical fact (an individual belonging to the\nJewish race) to which he must apply the discrimination of National Socialist rule. On the contrary,\nevery gesture, every event in the camp, from the most ordinary to the most exceptional, enacts the\ndecision on bare life by which the German biopolitical body is made actual. The separation of the\nJewish body is the immediate production of the specifically German body, just as its production is\nthe application of the rule. (Agamben, 1998, pp. 173\u201374)\nWhat is interesting about this account of the (Nazi) camp is its emphasis not so much on the power\nof destruction, but on the power of creation (hence, its connection with the divine, or at least with\nhumanity\u2019s usurpation of the divine). Indeed, this is Agamben\u2019s uniquely novel contribution to the\nhistory of \u2018the camp\u2019, the importance of which should not be understated. From the above quote, it is\nnot solely the case that the Nazis destroy the Jews, but that, at one and the same time, they create the\nAryan. Yet, it is precisely at this moment of what Agamben sees as the fusion of creation and\ndestruction that he moves toward dissolution of a specifically Jewish aspect of the Nazi murders into\nan overtly universalist stream of history.\nDiscussing the significance of the Nazi camps in Remnants of Auschwitz: The Witness and the\nArchive, Agamben brings into question both the specificity of Jewish extermination and its place\nwithin Nazi praxis:\n\u2018It is then possible to understand the decisive function of the camps and the systemof Nazi biopolitics.\nThey are notmerely [sic] the place of death and extermination, they are also, and above all, the site of\nthe production of the Musselman, the final biopolitical substance to be isolated in the biological\ncontinuum. Beyond the Musselman lies only the gas chamber.\u2019 (1999, p. 85, emphasis added)\nThe creation of theMusselman is deemed the \u2018decisive function\u2019 of biopolitics, the state of exception,\nNazism and \u2018the camp\u2019. The genocide of the Jews is but a means to an end, and no longer an end in\nitself. The murder of Jews loses its specific meaning and is, instead, dissolved into something even\nmore \u2018significant\u2019 and universal. That significance and meaning is the apparent birth of an entirely\nnew form of life; homo sacer or the Musselman.\nIn the camps, in the furnace of unlimited and absolute power \u2018man\u2019 has found the power to\nfinally usurp God through seemingly creating life. However, Agamben believes that it is a life that is\ndevoid of the divine spark and, instead, bears the mark of its biopolitical creator. This new life, homo\nsacer, exists, like the state of exception, like the camp, in the threshold of the divine and profane, of\nheaven and hell and life and death. The one who can be killed and not sacrificed, homo sacer is\nthe new universal citizen, the immediate product of the Revolutionary emancipation and the rights\nthrough which it was expressed \u2013 an \u2018absolute biological substance\u2019.\nWhat is so troubling about Agamben\u2019s account of emancipation and antisemitism is the way in\nwhich it replicates Marx\u2019s comments about Jacobin terror. Despite the differences in the approach to\nemancipation and rights that separate Bauer from Agamben, one problem is consistent. The nature\nTHE AUTONOMY OF THE POLITICAL AND THE DISSOLUTION OF THE JEWS 383\nof the political demands the dissolution and abstraction of the Jews into either the \u2018citizen\u2019 or the\n\u2018Musselman\u2019 \u2013 which, as we have seen, are but two sides of the same coin. If for Bauer emancipation is the\nproduct of idealism, for Agamben it is the product of a brute humanism incorporated into the absolutism\nof \u2018the political\u2019. Either way, any notion of a historical development of antisemitism, one that relies on\nthe playing out of emancipation and rights beyond the autonomy of the political and dependent upon a\nspecific historical context and specific historical developments is ruled out of court from the outset.\nJewish existence and Jewish dissolution, in other words, come to be explained through the prism of\nidealism or through the prism of power and positivism, of brute facts imposed upon the world.\nContrast this view with Hannah Arendt\u2019s account of antisemitism and the Holocaust that\nrecognises the agency (political and extra-political) that is involved in antisemitism. Although a\nfull description of her account is beyond the scope of the present essay, a few comments will suffice:\n\u2018The history of antisemitism, like the history of Jew-hatred, is part and parcel of the long\nand intricate story of Jewish\u2013Gentile relations under the conditions of Jewish dispersion.\u2019\n(Arendt, 1979 p. viii)\nArendt\u2019s entire account of antisemitism can be understood as the consequence of a material clash of\ninterests between Jews and Gentiles against the backdrop of modern, political emancipation. It is,\nmoreover, an account that, far from denying the presence of Jews and Jewish interests, places them at\nthe forefront. As the Preface of the section on \u2018Antisemitism\u2019 in the Origins of Totalitarianism makes\nplain, Arendt\u2019s concern is not an indictment of Jewish agency (although that is certainly present),\nbut, more fundamentally, is a reaction against the writing of history that makes Jews:\n\u2018[T]he perfect innocence of the victim, an innocence which insinuates not only that no evil was\ndone but that nothing at all was done which might possibly have a connection with the issue at\nstake . . . There is . . . a temptation to return to an explanation which automatically discharges the\nvictim of responsibility; it seems quite adequate to a reality in which nothing strikes us more\nforcibly than the utter innocence of the individual caught in the horror machine and his utter\ninability to change his fate.\u2019 (Arendt, 1979, pp. 5, 6)\nArendt\u2019s point here, of course, is that whilst the Jews are perfectly innocent of the accusations\nlevelled against them, they are not \u2018innocent\u2019 of the world that produced such myths. As she states:\n\u2018For this comprehension [of the Holocaust] a certain familiarity of Jewish history in nineteenth-\ncentury Europe and the attendant development of antisemitism is indispensable though, of\ncourse, not sufficient.\u2019 (Arendt, 1979, p. x)\nIt is from this perspective that Arendt offers a critique of modern emancipation, rights and anti-\nsemitism that is the outcome of a political presence, rather than the arbitrary consequence of\nautonomous power.\nIn accounting for modern antisemitism, Arendt looks most closely at the mechanisms of\nemancipation and the nature of the rights through which it was expressed. Put briefly, her argument\nis that antisemitism was the product of a conflict between Jews and Gentiles brought about by the\nsplit between civil society and the state that she sees as characterising the modern body politic. For\nArendt, the \u2018autonomy\u2019 or separation of the state from civil society that followed the Revolutions of\nthe late eighteenth century was almost stillborn. Chief amongst these problems was a lack of those\nwilling to finance the state institutions. Whereas the ancien re\u00b4gime, relied on the nobility for its\nfinancial support, the emerging bourgeoisie was far too concerned with its own interests even to\ncontemplate funding the new state.11 It is at this point that the Jews presented themselves as a\n11 For a discussion of the bourgeoisie\u2019s relationship to the state, see Marx, 1996.\nDAVID M. SEYMOUR384\npossible way to avoid collapse. Key to this strategy, however, was to ensure that the Jews remained\noutside the body politic, or, rather, outside the class structure of civil society. And, at this point, the\nneeds and interests of the state coincided with the needs and interests of a Jewish desire to ensure\n\u2018self-preservation and group survival\u2019. Paradoxically, this coincidence of aims became the ground\nfor the granting of rights, a grant that, as Marx also saw, was dependent upon Jewish presence and\nactivity.\nAs Arendt makes clear, it was this equivocality of modern Jewish existence that lay entwined\nwithin the core of emancipation from the beginning:\n\u2018Emancipation of the Jews, therefore, as granted by the national state system in Europe during the\nnineteenth century, had a double origin and an ever-present equivocal meaning. On the one hand,\nit was due to the political and legal structure of a new body politic which could function only\nunder the conditions of political and legal equality. Governments, for their own sake, had to iron\nout the inequalities of the old order as completely and as quickly as possible. On the other hand, it\nwas the clear result of a gradual extension of specific Jewish privileges, granted originally only to\nindividuals, then, through them to a small group of well-to-do Jews; only when this limited group\ncould not handle by themselves the ever-growing demands of state business, were these privileges\nfinally extended to the whole of Western and Central Jewry.\u2019 (Arendt, 1979, p. 12)\nArendt notes that the consequence of this specific relationship between state and the Jews, and\nwhich, was an \u2018open secret\u2019 to all concerned, was that each class that entered into conflict with the\nstate also entered into a conflict with the Jews. It was as a consequence of these clashes that when the\nnation-state evaporated a century and a half later, the totalitarianism that emerged from its short-\ncomings structured itself around the specificity of the Jews and antisemitism:\n\u2018[T]he Jewish question and antisemitism, relatively unimportant phenomena in terms of world\npolitics, became the catalytic agent first for the rise of the Nazi movement and the establishment\nof the organizational structure of the Third Reich, in which every citizen had to prove he was not\na Jew, then for a world war of unprecedented ferocity, and finally for the emergence of the\nunprecedented crime of genocide in the midst of Occidental civilization.\u2019 (Arendt, 1979, p. x)\nIt was partly as a result of these conflicts that with the decline of the nation-state some hundred years\nor so later and its substitution with totalitarianism and themass in place of state and civil society, the\nJews were thrown into the storm centre of events.\nAs this last point makes clear, although Arendt identifies the seeds or origins of totalitarianism\nwithin the nation-state, she draws a strong distinction between it and totalitarianism (i.e. Nazism). It is\nimportant to note, however, that even though she argues that antisemitism only came to maturity as\nan ideology or \u2018key to history\u2019 after the reality of Jewish\u2013Gentile conflicts of interests,12 she still offers\nan account of Nazism that draws on its external preconditions. That precondition is what she terms\n\u2018superfluousness\u2019. Superfluousness points to the idea that totalitarianism can only arise at a point in\ntime when the majority of the nation-state\u2019s population is deemed to be \u2018superfluous\u2019 in the sense of\nunnecessary for rational economic, social and political purposes. Indeed, it is the desire to make lives\nmeaningful that Arendt sees as the attraction and necessity of totalitarianism. The point is, however,\nthat for Arendt, in contradiction to Agamben, antisemitism is the outcome not of autonomous and\nautomatic practices, but of very real conflicts of interest brought about by very real agency of groups of\nindividuals, including those of an active Jewish history. Arendt is thus able to hold on to both the\nuniversal significance of totalitarianism, its camps and its murders, whilst, at the same time, acknowl-\nedging the specific nature of Nazism\u2019s obsession with the Jews.\n12 Arendt notes that assimilation was almost complete following the loss of the Jews\u2019 financing of the state.\nTHE AUTONOMY OF THE POLITICAL AND THE DISSOLUTION OF THE JEWS 385\nConclusion\n\u2018Many still consider it an accident that Nazi ideology centred around antisemitism and that Nazi\npolicy, consistently and uncompromisingly, aimed at the persecution and finally the extermi-\nnation of the Jews. Only the horror of the final catastrophe, and even more the homelessness\nand uprootedness of the survivors, made the \u2018Jewish question\u2019 so prominent in our everyday\npolitical life. What the Nazis themselves claimed to be their chief discovery \u2013 the role of the\nJewish people in world politics \u2013 and their chief interest \u2013 persecution of Jews all over the world \u2013\nhave been regarded by public opinion as a pretext for winning the masses or an interesting device\nor demagogy.\u2019 (Arendt, 1979, p. 3)\nSixty or so years later, a similar tendency is re-emerging. The specifically Jewish aspect of the\nHolocaust is again being dissolved into a more generalised and universalised sweep of \u2018history\u2019.\nJust as for Bauer, modern emancipation demanded the dissolving of Jews into the onrushing wave of\nself-consciousness, for Agamben, the specific fate of the Jews is dissolved into the modern hubris of\nbiopolitics and its Frankenstein-like creation, homo sacer.13\nBy focusing their attention on the alleged autonomy of the state, both Bauer and Agamben\nreproduce the very terror at the theoretical level that is implied in Bauer\u2019s anti-emancipationist\napproach and is the object of critique in Agamben\u2019s work. At both the normative and descriptive\nlevels, the universalism of the political is treated as if its dominance over and separation from all\nother aspects of existence is an accomplished fact. The terror Marx recognised as necessary in such\ndomination \u2013 the suppression of particularities \u2013 is repeated. This replication, the entire presence\nand history of emancipated Jewry, that is, their modern, emancipated, existence which includes their\nspecific interests as well as their conflict of interests with other groups, is denied and erased from the\nrecord. The specificity of antisemitism and the Holocaust are dissolved into a universalist domina-\ntion through which mass murder becomes the responsibility of no one and the fate of all without\ndistinction. Not only, therefore, are we left with a genocide without perpetrators,14 but also, a\nHolocaust without Jews. And, as Arendt notes:\n\u2018In this inherent negation of the significance of human behaviour, they bear a terrible resem-\nblance to those modern practices and forms of government which, by means of arbitrary terror,\nliquidate the very possibility of human activity. Somehow in the extermination camps Jews were\nmurdered as if in accordance with the explanation these doctrines had given of why they were\nhated: regardless of what they had done or omitted to do, regardless of vice or virtue. Moreover,\nthe murderers themselves, only obeying orders and proud of their passionless efficiency, uncan-\nnily resembled the \u2018\u2018innocent\u2019\u2019 instruments of an inhuman impersonal course of events which\nthe doctrine of eternal antisemitism had considered them to be.\u2019 (Arendt, 1979, p. 8)\nUnless and until we take Arendt\u2019s injunction seriously along with her insight that, \u2018history ismade of\nmany groups and that for certain reasons one group was singled out\u2019 (1979, p. 5) \u2013 including amongst\nthose reasons, the interests and choices of Jews \u2013 the risk is run that any reference to Jewish\nspecificity, even in death, can be interpreted as the Jews, again, demanding \u2018special privileges\u2019 and\nthe Holocaust itself takes its place in the chain of the antisemitic imagination.\n13 In this context, it is interesting to note Agamben\u2019s rejection of and refusal to use the term \u2018Holocaust\u2019 on the\ngrounds that \u2018the term\u2019s usage in polemics against the Jews also has a history, even if it is a secret one\nnot recorded by dictionaries . . . the first use of holocaust with reference to a massacre of Jews in a violently\nanti-Semitic [sic] fashion [1189]\u2019 (1989, p. 30). (For an alternative approach to Agamben\u2019s philology, see\nNietzsche\u2019s discussion of the term \u2018good\u2019 in the first essay of (2002).) Agamben does not offer a substitute\nword or concept to refer to the specifically Jewish dimension to the Nazi mass murders.\n14 See Fine, 2001; Bernstein, 1996.\nDAVID M.
