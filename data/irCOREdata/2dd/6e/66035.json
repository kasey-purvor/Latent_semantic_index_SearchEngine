Our model is computationally intensive but pro-\nvides a general framework for incorporating future changes in the\nsize of multimember cooperative breeding groups.\nKeywords: cooperative breeding, ESS model, reproductive skew, social\nqueuing.\nAmong social species, decisions regarding leaving and join-\ning social groups are crucial to understanding both group\ndynamics and within-group interactions. Determining the\nbasis of these decisions has important implications for\nboth our interpretation of social evolution and our un-\nderstanding of, for example, the partitioning of repro-\nduction between group members (the degree of repro-\nductive skew). However, optimal decisions regarding\njoining and leaving groups are rarely examined in models\nof actual populations, prompting calls for models that fo-\ncus on specific systems (Clutton-Brock 1998a; Johnstone\n2000; Magrath and Heinsohn 2000).\nDetermining optimal dispersal decisions is complex,\nowing to the dynamic nature of social groups, which may\nconfound attempts to assess the long-term consequences\nof decisions. The issue is further complicated by the in-\nterdependence of the behaviors of different group mem-\nbers. This interdependence requires a game-theoretic ap-\nproach that assesses the optimal strategy of an animal in\na given state (e.g., of age, rank, or physical condition) in\nrelation to the optimal behaviors of conspecifics (Maynard\nSmith 1982). Given the computational requirements of\nsuch an approach, it is perhaps unsurprising that most\ntheoretical models of optimal behavior within groups focus\non the smallest possible groups (of only two members;\ne.g., Johnstone and Cant 1999; Kokko and Johnstone\n1999), treat subordinates as generally identical (e.g., Reeve\nand Emlen 2000), or treat the decisions of subordinates\nas independent (e.g., Johnstone et al. 1999). Determining\noptimal behaviors in complex social settings is also open\nto the criticism that animals cannot possibly be aware of\nthe precise decisions that their conspecifics will make or\nDispersal and Eviction in Meerkats 121\nof the exact state of their environment and the opportu-\nnities available to them.\nOne recent development has substantially alleviated\nboth the problem of computational intensity and that of\nthe assumption of omniscience. Specifically, McNamara et\nal. (1997) have developed a method that permits optimal\nbehaviors to be determined while incorporating the po-\ntential for error. This not only ensures a unique solution\nfor game-theoretic optimization, increasing the chances of\ndetermining a solution with less computational effort, but\nit is also more realistic. Animals will not always make the\nright decision, and the approach of McNamara et al.\n(1997) allows for this. Critically, however, the probability\nthat an animal will make a wrong decision decreases with\nthe cost of that decision, thus ensuring that the greater\nthe selective pressure for correct decision making, the less\noften model solutions will suggest that animals will err.\nIn this article, we use empirical data to parameterize a\nmodel of evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS; Maynard\nSmith 1982) for dispersal and eviction among social mam-\nmals that we assume can disperse only once in their life.\nWe follow earlier syntheses that assess the stability of group\nmembership (Higashi and Yamamura 1993) by consid-\nering the evolutionary interests of more than one party.\nSpecifically, we consider how the interests of both domi-\nnants and subordinates are affected by subordinate de-\npartures. The interests of these parties are likely to differ\nbecause relatedness between actors and their offspring is\nunlikely to be the same as the relatedness between actors\nand the offspring of others. Our approach is applicable to\nmultimember groups and also considers the future inter-\nests of individuals.\nThe model is constructed with reference to the life his-\ntory of the meerkat, a desert-adapted, social mongoose\nliving in groups containing two to more than 30 members\n(e.g., Clutton-Brock et al. 1999a; Russell et al. 2002). At\npresent, less is known about the reproductive success of\nmales than of females of this species, and, consequently,\nwe focus on the processes underlying female membership\nof groups. We use the model to address three major ques-\ntions. Can long-term fitness considerations explain the\nemigration behavior of female meerkats and, thus, the\nregulation of group size? Do long-term fitness consider-\nations lead to conflict between dominant and subordinate\nmeerkats? What is the most likely nature of conflict over\ngroup membership, and what are the implications of this\nfor our understanding of reproductive skew?\nMethods\nStudy Species\nThe study species is described in detail elsewhere (e.g., van\nStaaden 1994), but here we present a brief description of\nsome aspects relevant to this study. Meerkats are small,\nsocial mongooses, rarely exceeding 800 g in weight. They\nform social, matrilineal groups of from two to more than\n30 individuals, typically ranging over an area of 2\u20135 km2.\nIn each group, one male and one female are socially dom-\ninant and are the parents of most of the litters born\n(Clutton-Brock et al. 2001a; Griffin et al. 2003). Subor-\ndinate females may attempt to breed in their natal group,\nalthough their offspring are often killed by the dominant\nfemale (Clutton-Brock et al. 1998; Russell et al. 2003a).\nMales never gain reproduction in their natal group but\nmay do so by roving for short periods of time in search\nof subordinate females from other groups (Griffin et al.\n2003). Breeding occurs primarily during the months of\nSeptember to March, but births have been recorded in\nmost months of the year (Russell et al. 2003a). There is\nno evidence of pronounced seasonal mortality (Clutton-\nBrock et al. 1999b). Pups remain below ground for much\nof their first month of life but can be counted between 2\nand 3 weeks of age during temporary emergence (Broth-\nerton et al. 2001; Russell et al. 2003a). Litter failure is rare\nfor dominant females but common for subordinates\n(Clutton-Brock et al. 1998; Russell et al. 2003a). During\ntheir first year of life, females seldom breed or disperse,\nand males seldom disperse or go prospecting for females;\ninstead, most individuals concentrate on helping (Clutton-\nBrock et al. 2002). Among females, immigration into other\ngroups does not occur, and successful emigration results\nin the formation of a new group.\nFor the data used to parameterize our model, meerkats\nwere studied on uncultivated ranchland near Vanzylsrus\n(25\u00028\u0001S, 20\u000249\u0001E) in the South African Kalahari. Details\nof the habitat and climate during the study period are\nprovided elsewhere (Clutton-Brock et al. 1999b; Russell et\nal. 2002). Up to 28 groups were identified during the study\nperiod (1993\u20132001), but for the life-history data presented\nbelow, only data from the 14 most intensively studied\ngroups were used. These data comprised over 240,000\nmeerkat days. Where necessary, means are presented with\none standard error.\nThe Model\nCurrently, female reproductive success is better under-\nstood than that of males, and, hence, the model focuses\non the behavior of females. We consider the decision faced\nby a subordinate female of rank x in group size y of\nwhether to disperse and, similarly, the decision faced by\nthe dominant regarding whether to evict that subordinate.\nThree behavioral assumptions are inherent in the model\ndesign, and we detail these before describing the model\nstructure and, finally, the process of model parameteri-\nzation.\n122 The American Naturalist\nTable 1: Notation used in the model description\nParameter Description\nC Number of pathways by which an individual may make a stated transition\nd Decision error parameter; see text and McNamara et al.

Dominant tenures are\nlong (mean, years; range, 80 days to 5.7 years;2.0\u0003 0.4\n; the true mean may be even longer, but our datanp 22\ninclude some tenures where dominants were already in\nplace at the start of the study). For the 14 core groups,\nhowever, 22 new instances of dominance were observed\nwithin groups of known age compositions. In six cases,\nonly one adult female was present, and this female became\nthe dominant; in three cases, only two adult females of\nequal age were present, and one went on to become the\ndominant. However, in the remaining 13 cases, adult fe-\nmales of varying ages were present. In 12 of these 13 cases,\nthe oldest (or one of the oldest, where more than one\nanimal of the age of the oldest subordinate was present)\nwent on to become the dominant. Thus, it seems likely\nthat age is a good predictor of attaining dominance in the\nevent of a breeding vacancy.\nNew female dominants arise from within the group. This\nis also consistent with the above data on 22 changes of\ndominance. In each case, the replacement came from\nwithin the group.\nFemales do not immigrate into established groups. Of 47\nfemales that are known to have emigrated from the core\ngroups, none has subsequently been recorded in any pre-\nviously established group.\nModel Derivation\nThe model uses an iterative, game-theoretic approach to\ndetermine the ESS for dispersal by female meerkats in any\n(x, y) state (i.e., of a given rank in a given group size).\nThese strategies (expressed as a probability of dispersal,\nPD[x, y], ) are compared to the ESS for0 \u2264 P [x, y] \u2264 1D\ndominant females to evict subordinate female group mem-\nbers in any given (x, y) state, PE(x, y) ( ).0 \u2264 P [x, y] \u2264 1E\nNotation used in the model description is defined in table\n1.\nFuture reproductive success may influence the dispersal\ndecisions of social animals that queue to inherit domi-\nnance (Kokko and Johnstone 1999). Consequently, our\nmodel assesses the consequences of dispersal (and evic-\ntion) decisions by forecasting forward over T time steps\nto determine the residual fitness of a decision made at the\nstart of the entire period ( ). The basic time step usedtp 0\nis a 3-month period (hereafter referred to as a \u201cquarter\u201d),\nas this is the approximate minimum interbirth interval\n(Russell et al. 2003a). A simple algorithm for the model\nis given in the appendix in the online edition of the Amer-\nDispersal and Eviction in Meerkats 123\nican Naturalist, but here we detail some of the underlying\ntheory. Our description is based on determining ESS values\nfor PD(x, y) but is applicable to determining eviction prob-\nabilities also, except where noted. We assume that all\ndeaths and departures take place at the start of the time\nstep.\nWe begin by determining the between-state transition\nprobabilities for a single time step, according to an indi-\nvidual\u2019s behavior at the start of that time step. Transitions\nwere calculated in three different ways, depending on the\nactor\u2019s state and behavior. Specifically, transitions were cal-\nculated for individuals that remained in their natal group,\nindividuals that remained in a group that they had helped\nto found, and individuals that emigrated to help found a\nnew group (e.g., fig. 1). Here, we outline the process of\ncalculating transitions for the first of these scenarios. Major\ndifferences involved in calculating transitions for the sec-\nond and third scenarios are noted where appropriate and\nare described in more detail in the appendix.\nThe probability of any transition de-\u2032 \u2032(x, y) r (x , y )\npends on three components. These are as follows: P(x r\n, the probability with which a new rank (x \u2032,\u2032 \u2032x ) 1 \u2264 x \u2264\n) is attained; , the probability that a new groupx P(y r y )int\nsize (yint, ) is attained following all\n\u2032 \u2032x \u2264 y \u2264 y\u0001 x\u0002 xint\ndeaths and dispersals; and P(a), the probability that the\ngroup is augmented by the maturation of a female young\nduring the time step, such that the final group size is\n.\u2032y p y \u0002 aint\nThe first two of these components are dependent on\nthe probability with which each group member is present\nin the group at the next time step. For a given individual\nin state (x, y), this probability is\nP (x, y)p S(y) # [1\u0001 P (x, y)], (1)R D\nwhere PR(x, y) is the probability that she remains in the\ngroup, S(y) is her probability of survival over the time\nstep as a function of group size, and PD(x, y) is the state-\nspecific probability that she will disperse during any time\nstep. Where transitions were calculated for an individual\nthat dispersed, we used PN(x, y), the probability with which\nan individual would be present in a newly formed group,\nin place of PR(x, y):\nP (x, y)p S(d) # P (x, y), (2)N D\nwhere S(d) is the probability of surviving emigration. Note\nthat in this case, because dominant females never disperse,\nthe destination ranks and group sizes were bounded as\nand , respectively.\u2032 \u20321 \u2264 x \u2264 x\u0001 1 1 \u2264 y \u2264 y\u0001 1\nTypically, for any or transition,\u2032(x) r (x ) (y) r (y )int\nthere are multiple combinations of individual fates by\nwhich the transition can be made.

Similarly, thew\u02c6(d) tp 0\nfitness of all other group members could be calculated\naccording to whether the focal individual stayed or dis-\npersed. For an individual in the focal state, the inclusive\nfitness of a decision to leave the group, Dwd(x, y), was\nthen calculated as\ny\n\u02c6 \u02c6[ ]Dw (x, y)p R(i, x) w (d)\u0001 w (r) , (8)\u0001d i i\nip1\nwhere R(i, x) is the relatedness of an individual in state\n(i, y) to the focal state and the expected fitnesses, w\u02c6 (d)i\nand , are the expected direct fitnesses of individualsw\u02c6 (r)i\nin state (i, y) if an individual in the focal state disperses\nor remains in the group, respectively.

For\nall other states, PD(x, y) was given an initial value of 0.5.\nUsing these initial probabilities, the inclusive fitness of the\ndecision to disperse by individuals in each state was cal-\nculated. For states with negative inclusive fitness, PD(x, y)\nwas reduced, while for those with positive inclusive fitness,\nPD(x, y) was increased. Specifically, the new value of PD(x,\ny) was calculated by two steps. First, following McNamara\net al. (1997), the value of PD(x, y) that represents the \u201cbest\nresponse,\u201d B(x, y), to all other current strategies in the\npopulation was calculated as\n1\nB(x, y)p . (10)\nDw (x, y)\/dd1\u0002 e\nThis approach allows for some level of error in the decision\nmaking of individuals and has two key properties: it is\nlikely to be more realistic, and it increases the potential\nfor convergence to an ESS. The amount of error permitted\nby equation (10) is controlled by the parameter d (0 \u2264\n). As , B(x, y) approaches the value it wouldd \u2264 1 d r 0\ntake if error was not included in the calculation. For sim-\nple, two-player games, values of can greatly increased ! 0.1\nthe probability of convergence to an ESS (McNamara et\nal. 1997). For our model, however, which simultaneously\naimed to reach convergence for the strategies of over 150\ndifferent states, it is both realistic and computationally\nbeneficial to use a higher value of d. Preliminary simu-\nlations indicated that a value of led to most sce-dp 0.2\nnarios converging to a solution within 500 iterations, and\nwe therefore used this value throughout.\nThe second step in calculating the new value of PD(x,\ny) was to adjust it toward the best response. We used the\nformula\n[ ]P (x, y)p P (x, y)\u0002 l B(x, y)\u0001 P (x, y) , (11)D D D\nin which the parameter l is used to damp the adjustments,\navoiding the danger of nonconvergent oscillations. We\nused a value of .lp 0.1\nThe model was reiterated until convergence was reached\nand the values of PD(x, y) so obtained were taken to be\nthe ESS solution. The iterative approach was then repeated\nto find the equilibrium values of PE(x, y) for each state,\nusing the slight modification detailed in equation (9).\nTo facilitate comparisons of the model output with field\ndata, we also ran simple stochastic simulations to deter-\nmine expected group size distributions as a function of\nS(d). For these, groups of from two to four adult females\nwere generated, and changes in group size were assessed\non a quarterly basis. Each quarter, every individual had a\nstate-specific probability of no longer being present in the\ngroup, , given by1\u0001 P (x, y)R\n1\u0001 P (x, y)p max [P (x, y), P (x, y)]R D E\n\u0002 {1\u0001max [P (x, y), P (x, y)]} # [1\u0001 S(y)].

Group\nsizes were recorded each quarter for 30 time steps. This\nprocess was reiterated one million times for each of the\nsets of PD(x, y) and PE(x, y) associated with each probability\nof emigrant survival S(d).\nModel Parameterization\nData on survival, fecundity, and emigration behavior of\nmeerkats have been extensively analyzed and are presented\nelsewhere (e.g., Clutton-Brock et al. 1999a, 1999b, 2001b;\nRussell et al. 2002, 2003a). We analyzed the current data\nset specifically to provide the parameters necessary for our\ndispersal model. In particular, we examined eviction and\ndispersal success, survival, fecundity, relatedness, and\ngroup composition. Where the term is used below, \u201cgroup\nsize\u201d excludes pups of less than 90 days old.\nAnimals were assumed to have died if they disappeared\nbefore 6 months of age, if a carcass was found, or if they\ndisappeared suddenly despite showing no dispersive ten-\ndencies (such as foraging away from the rest of the group)\nover previous days. That females are often temporarily\nevicted from their group while the dominant female is\npregnant (Clutton-Brock et al. 1998) and that males com-\nmonly go prospecting (Doolan and Macdonald 1996)\nmakes accurate identification of permanent emigration\ndifficult. Dispersal was recorded if animals were observed\nalone or with another group, outside the range of their\noriginal group, and if they did not return to the source\ngroup. By this definition, most female disappearances\ncould be attributed either to dispersal or to mortality. For\nmales, this was less clear-cut, due to their tendency to\nremain with different groups for prolonged periods.\nEviction and survival of emigrants. During the study pe-\nriod, 134 clear instances of subordinate female eviction\nfrom the 14 core groups were recorded. The frequency\nwith which this occurred (in relation to group size) is\nshown in figure 2a. Of the 134 evicted females, 87 returned\nat a later date, indicating that eviction was only a tem-\nporary measure (Clutton-Brock et al. 1998). The remain-\ning 47 females emigrated in 17 separate events. Of these,\nthe number of females per event varied from one to six\n( ). Six of these 17 emigration events (35%) aremodep 4\nknown to have resulted in the successful founding of new\ngroups. Only three dispersers (out of the 47) are known\nto have died before founding a new group, but a further\n27 individuals disappeared abruptly and were never seen\nagain in or around the study area; these data accord well\nwith more intensive observations of radio-collared dis-\npersers (Young 2003). Long-distance dispersal cannot be\nruled out for these individuals although survival over long\ndistances and through unfamiliar ground is likely to be\nlow. Furthermore, surviving dispersal is no guarantee that\nindividuals will be successful in forming new groups. In\ncaged trials, only two of five (40%) potential groups re-\nmained together when animals were removed and placed\nin vacant ranges. Consequently, while it is possible that\nsome of the unaccounted individuals were successful, it is\nunlikely that the probability of surviving dispersal is much\ngreater than the confirmed probability of 35%.\nSurvival. Daily survival rates were calculated using a\nstandard Mayfield analysis (Mayfield 1975) for all indi-\nviduals from emergence to 6 months, for all individuals\nof over 6 months, and for females only over 6 months\n(this was necessitated by the model structure). Survival\nrates were also analyzed for each group during each 3-\nmonth period and were related to the group size at the\nstart of the period. Daily survival rates were as follows:\n0.9983 for animals of both sexes from emergence to 6\nmonths, 0.9995 for all individuals over 6 months old, and\n0.9994 for females only over 6 months old. These equate\nto a mortality rate between emergence and 6 months of\napproximately 24% and annual mortalities for animals\nover 6 months old of 17% (both sexes combined) or 20%\n(females only). If all unaccounted disappearances were as-\nsumed to be mortality, then the combined annual mor-\ntality of animals over 6 months old would be 25%. Re-\nlationships between survival rates and group sizes are\nshown in figure 2b\u20132d.\nFecundity. For fecundity analysis, frequency of litter pro-\nduction and litter size may be affected in different ways\n(Russell et al. 2003a). Females are constrained by a min-\nimum interbirth interval and typically produce no more\nthan one litter in any 3-month period. We divided the\nstudy period into 27 periods of 3 months\u2019 duration. For\neach female exceeding 1 year old present in a given group\nfor over two-thirds of a 3-month period, the average group\nsize during that period was recorded, together with a bi-\nnary score, according to whether she produced an emer-\ngent litter (1) or not (0). The effects of group, female\nidentity, female age, group size, and female dominance\nstatus on the probability of producing an emergent litter\nin any 3-month period were assessed using a generalized\nlinear mixed model (GENSTAT 5, release 4.1, Rothamsted\nExperimental Station, Harpenden), with female and group\nidentities entered as random factors (Schall 1991). To as-\nsess variables affecting the size of emergent litters, we used\na residual maximum likelihood model in GENSTAT, again\nwith female and group identities fitted as random terms.\nWe investigated whether litter sizes at emergence were in-\nfluenced by female age, status, group size, and number of\nreproductively mature females averaged over the 2 weeks\nbefore emergence.\nWe identified 524 unique combinations of female,\ngroup, and period, during which 130 emergent litters were\nDispersal and Eviction in Meerkats 127\nproduced. Neither individual nor group identities consti-\ntuted significant random terms, and hence, a binary lo-\ngistic regression was performed. This indicated that female\nstatus and group size both had significant effects on the\nprobability of a litter emerging in any 3-month period but\nthat these effects were not always straightforward. Per-\ncapita probabilities of producing an emergent litter were\nhigher for dominants than subordinates and increased\nwith group size for dominants but decreased with group\nsize for subordinates (fig. 2e). Only female status showed\na significant effect on the size of emergent litters (domi-\nnants, ; subordinates,meanp 3.95\u0003 0.15 meanp\n; , ). The parameters de-22.90\u0003 0.23 x p 15.34 p ! .0011\nrived for survival from emergence to 1 year old, as well\nas fecundity, were combined to predict female fitness (in\nterms of young raised to adulthood) in relation to group\nsize. Relationships between annual direct fitness and group\nsize for both dominant and subordinate females were well\ndescribed by fourth-order polynomials (fig. 2f ).\nGroup composition. During the study period, groups var-\nied in size from two to 34 individuals, excluding pups of\nless than 90 days old. We assessed group membership on\na day-by-day basis to determine the number of females\nper group of more than 90 days of age. Numbers of females\nper group varied from one to 16, and the mean was\n(standard deviation). The number of females as5.9\u0003 3.0\na proportion of group size was assessed as an index of\ngroup composition, using groups containing at least two\nfemales (i.e., those of interest for the purpose of modeling\nemigration decisions). The number of females as a pro-\nportion of group size was not significantly different from\n0.5 (mean female ; one-proportionp 0.485\u0003 0.009\nsample t-test, not significant). For simplicity, therefore, the\nmodel was based on adult female group size with the as-\nsumption that total adult group size would be approxi-\nmately twice as large.\nRelatedness. Relatedness between dyads within groups\nwas assessed on the basis of known pedigrees. More than\n1,000 unique dyads were identified from the data, and\nrelatedness could be determined in 793 cases where the\norigin and parentage of both individuals could be assigned\nwith confidence. None of these dyads consisted of unre-\nlated individuals, and the majority (65%) were full sibs or\nmother-daughter dyads ( ). Next most commonrp 0.5\n(26% of dyads) were those with (e.g., half-sibs,rp 0.25\ngrandmother-granddaughter, or cousins). Overall, relat-\nedness was higher between dominants and subordinates\n(mean , ) than between subordinate pairsrp 0.47 np 109\n(mean , ).rp 0.39 np 684\nResults\nWhen any set of model parameters led to a convergent\nsolution, the output was a series of state-specific dispersal\nor eviction probabilities (depending on whether the in-\nterests of subordinates or dominants were considered).\nWhen group sizes of up to 18 adult females were consid-\nered, over 150 state-specific probabilities were generated.\nInterpretation of such a large number of probabilities is\ncomplex. However, from the state-specific probabilities, we\nderived the total probability with which one, two, or more\nindividuals would disperse (or be evicted) as a function\nof group size. This, in turn, permitted the average number\nof emigrants (either dispersers, N[D], or evictees, N[E])\nto be determined, also as a function of group size. An\nexample of this process is shown in figure 3.\nAverage numbers of dispersers (or individuals evicted)\nper quarter as a function of group size was a useful re-\nlationship by which to compare the results of different\nparameter combinations. In particular, we used this output\nto conduct a sensitivity analysis of the model predictions\nto the total number of time steps considered, T (fig. 4a).\nAs might be expected, individuals were more likely to dis-\nperse (and thus shorten their wait for dominant status)\nwhen shorter time periods were considered. However, this\nwillingness to disperse reduced by smaller increments as\nthe total time considered was increased. Increases in the\ntotal time considered above 100 time steps (equivalent to\n25 years) produced very little change in the model pre-\ndictions, and thus, we used as the standard periodTp 100\nover which to forecast the consequences of an action. Sim-\nilarly, we assessed the sensitivity of model predictions to\nthe maximum group size considered in the model. Model\noutput appeared to be very robust to this parameter (e.g.,\nfig. 4b, 4c). The maximum group size observed during the\nfield study was 16 adult females, but for flexibility in the\nmodel, we allowed for the possibility that groups could\nslightly exceed this size. All further results were based on\nassessments using a maximum group size of 18 adult\nfemales.\nPredicted state-specific dispersal and eviction probabil-\nities, together with predictions of mean numbers of dis-\npersers and evicted individuals, were combined to develop\na representation of expected dispersal and eviction be-\nhaviors, as a function of both group size, y, and survival\nof emigrants, S(d). Specifically, the parameter space de-\nscribed by these factors was categorized into regions of\nfive different behavior types: (1) stability: ,N(E) ! 0.5\n; (2) eviction only: for allN(D) ! 0.5 P (x, y) 1 P (x, y)E D\n; (3) primarily eviction: , butx 1 1 N(E) 1 N(D) P (x, y) 1E\nis not true for all ; (4) primarily dispersal:P (x, y) x 1 1D\n, but is not true for allN(D) 1 N(E) P (x, y) 1 P (x, y)D E\n; and (5) dispersal only: for allx 1 1 P (x, y) 1 P (x, y)D E\n.x 1 1\nRegions of parameter space characterized by these five\ndifferent patterns of behavior are shown in figure 5.\nGroups are expected to be highly stable, with few depar-\n\nDispersal and Eviction in Meerkats 129\nFigure 2: Relationships between life-history parameters and group size derived from the field data. a, Eviction rate (females evicted per quarter of\nmonitoring).

This corresponds to\ntotal adult group sizes of from eight to 12 individuals,\nbelow which subordinate females would seldom be ex-\npected to disperse or be evicted. In general, figure 5 in-\ndicates that eviction is likely to be more common than\ndispersal throughout the broad range of parameter space,\nwith the largest behavioral region that in which evictions\noutnumber dispersal. Only when the expected survival of\nemigrants is high is it likely that individuals would disperse\nvoluntarily with any regularity. Furthermore, situations\nwhere the dominant female would favor retaining sub-\nordinates but the subordinates would be more likely to\ndisperse are restricted to the single case in the top left\ncorner of figure 5 (where group size , and emigrantyp 2\nsurvival ). Interpreting the likely patterns ofS[d]p 0.9\nbehavior within the five regions distinguished in figure 5\nis complex and depends on the nature of control within\nthe group and, in particular, the physical costs of eviction\nto the dominant female. We return to this issue in the\n\u201cDiscussion.\u201d\nFinally, we also used simple simulations to generate ex-\npected group size distributions, given the probabilities of\ndispersal and eviction determined by our ESS model. Mean\nand standard deviations of group size (in terms of number\nof females) were determined as a function of the survival\nof emigrants and were compared to those derived from\nthe empirical data (fig. 6).\nDiscussion\nOur model uses empirical data to determine ESS proba-\nbilities of dispersal for subordinate female meerkats and\nESS probabilities of their eviction by dominant females.\nAs might be expected for a detailed analysis of complex\nsocial behaviors, the results themselves are complex. Nev-\nertheless, the model indicates that a number of general\npatterns of behavior might be expected among female\nmeerkats. In particular, four findings are of interest both\nin the context of meerkat behavior and, more generally,\nto our understanding of aspects of group living and social\nbehavior. These include that long-term fitness benefits can\nexplain observed group sizes of meerkats, that eviction\nseems far more prevalent than dispersal as a mechanism\nfor regulating group size, that situations where dominants\nmight benefit from providing staying incentives to sub-\nordinates are unlikely to arise, and that conflict and evic-\ntion may arise even in situations where some subordinates\nmight benefit from dispersal.\nAn assessment of group size based on only 14 focal\ngroups must be treated with some caution, as mean group\nsize may be susceptible to the size of individual groups\nthat have been monitored for the longest periods. Nev-\nertheless, the sizes of groups monitored during the em-\npirical study do provide some guide to expected levels of\nemigration. In particular, figure 6 shows that group size\ndistributions suggested by ESS emigration levels corre-\nspond most closely with those seen in the empirical study\nwhen the survival of emigrants is between 0.3 and 0.4.\nThis is encouraging, given that the confirmed survival rate\nof emigrants from the empirical study is approximately\n0.35, and suggests that meerkat group sizes can be ex-\nplained by decisions made on the basis of long-term fitness\nconsiderations.\nEviction is a common phenomenon in social species\nand has been documented, for example, in hyenas (Crocuta\ncrocuta; Holekamp et al. 1993), banded mongooses (Mun-\ngos mungo; Cant et al. 2001), house mice (Mus domesticus;\nGerlach 1996), Arabian babblers (Turdoides squamiceps;\nZahavi 1991), and splendid fairy wrens (Malurus cyaneus;\nMulder 1995). A variety of explanations may underlie the\neviction of subordinates, but our model suggests that for\nmeerkats at least, group size regulation by the dominant\nin order to maximize her inclusive fitness may well un-\nderlie this behavior. Our results suggest that throughout\nthe broad range of parameter space, and particularly for\nsituations where survival of emigrants is relatively low\n(\u22640.4), eviction is likely to be the dominant behavior reg-\nulating group size (fig. 6). This finding corresponds well\nwith behavioral data from the field study. While subor-\ndinate males cannot gain direct reproductive success in\ntheir own group and always disperse voluntarily, subor-\ndinate females are able to breed and inherit dominance in\nFigure 3: Sample model output when the number of time steps and the survival of dispersers .

Evictions can\noften be explained as a short-term mechanism, aimed at\npreventing subordinate females from breeding (at the ex-\npense of resources for the dominant\u2019s own offspring) and\navoiding infanticide (Clutton-Brock et al. 1998; Young\n2003). However, our results also suggest that when the\ndominant may make errors, evictions from even relatively\nsmall groups may sometimes occur (e.g., fig. 3c) for rea-\nsons other than these short-term considerations.\nGroups of social animals range from egalitarian, with\nlow levels of reproductive skew (e.g., lions, Panthera leo;\nPacker et al. 2001), to despotic, with high reproductive\nskew (e.g., Damaraland molerats, Cryptomys damarensis;\nBennett et al. 1996). A multitude of theoretical models has\nbeen published, seeking to explain this variation between\nspecies in terms of ecological, social, and genetic factors.\nOne class of these models is typified by the optimal skew\nmodel of Reeve and Ratnieks (1993). The optimal skew\napproach suggests that where larger group size is beneficial\nto dominants, subordinate reproduction may be tolerated\nin order to encourage subordinates to remain in the group.\nThis idea led to considerable controversy between the\ncompeting theories of such \u201cconcessions\u201d as explanations\nof subordinate reproduction versus the more parsimoni-\nous explanation that dominants simply lack complete con-\ntrol over the breeding behavior of subordinates (e.g.,\nClutton-Brock 1998a, 1998b; Emlen et al. 1998). Owing\nto the dearth of suitable data, empirical tests of this con-\ntroversy are rare, and interpreting the merits of competing\nmodels has proven difficult (Johnstone 2000). Our model\nsuggests that for meerkats at least, situations in which\ndominant animals would benefit from ceding additional\nreproduction to subordinates in order to persuade them\nto stay are extremely unlikely (fig. 5). Rather, the small\namounts of subordinate reproduction that occur are likely\nto result for one of the following reasons: (1) because a\nsmall amount of subordinate reproduction does not limit\nreproduction by dominants or is cheaper for dominants\nthan producing more of their own young (Cant and John-\nstone 1999); given the extent of dominant investment in\nharassment of potential competing breeders within the\nDispersal and Eviction in Meerkats 133\nFigure 6: Group size distributions (mean, filled circles; standard deviation [SD], error bars) predicted by simple simulations of group size variation\nbased on the evolutionarily stable strategies values of PD(x, y) and PE(x, y). Group sizes seen in the empirical study are indicated by mean (solid\nline) \u0003 1 SD (dashed lines) for the approximate value of emigrant survival, S(d), indicated by the field data.\ngroup and infanticide of competing litters (Clutton-Brock\net al. 1998), this explanation is unlikely to apply under\nmost circumstances. (2) because the dominant does not\nhave full control over subordinate reproduction, either\nbecause eviction is costly to the dominant and, therefore,\nsubordinates can afford to \u201csteal\u201d some reproduction with-\nout making their eviction worthwhile (Johnstone and Cant\n1999) or because securing all reproduction in the group\nrequires more effort than dominants are willing to expend\n(Clutton-Brock 1998a; Reeve et al. 1998).\nWe have noted that some aspects of our results are more\ndifficult to interpret. In particular, these include regions\nof parameter space in which both evictions and dispersal\nare possible (although one or the other is likely to be more\ncommon in numerical terms). In these areas, whether\nsome individuals would be evicted (reducing the proba-\nbility that remaining individuals would disperse) or dis-\nperse voluntarily (reducing others\u2019 probabilities of evic-\ntion) would depend on the nature of control within the\ngroup and the extent to which subordinates are aware of\nlikely evictions by their dominant.\nIt would be dangerous to read too much into the in-\ndividual probabilities of dispersal and eviction predicted\nby our model. Specific patterns of dispersal and eviction\nwould likely be sensitive to group composition and pat-\nterns of relatedness. Moreover, there are currently too few\ndata to determine whether the survival of emigrant meer-\nkats varies with their age or rank. That no female of less\nthan 1 year has been observed to emigrate, however, sug-\ngests that for these individuals the probability of surviving\nemigration is likely close to 0. Similarly, we might expect\nthat the probability of older animals (that have eluded\npredation for longer) surviving emigration might be ex-\npected to be higher than that for younger animals. The\nrelationship between number of emigrants and success is\nalso unknown at present. Low-ranking subordinates may\naccept subordination in a newly formed group if by mov-\ning, they increase their rank and, thus, their prospects for\nterritory inheritance (although the costs of helping in a\nsmall, newly formed group will be high; Russell et al.\n2003b). If the relationship between number of dispersers\nand probability of success were known, it would be useful\nto incorporate this into the model. Data currently being\nanalyzed may well permit such developments (A. J. Young\nand T. H. Clutton-Brock, unpublished data).\nFinally, our model is designed to assess decisions made\n134 The American Naturalist\non the basis of mean expectations of fitness, measured as\nthe number of young raised to independence. Two alter-\nnative formulations are possible, which may well affect the\nmodel results. First, it may be preferable to use state-\ndependent reproductive values (Houston and McNamara\n1999) instead of young raised to independence. State-\ndependent reproductive values allow for future changes in\npopulation size and the consequent changes in the value\nof having offspring now as opposed to later. Due to a lack\nof data on density-dependent constraints on population\ntrajectories, we modeled opportunities for dispersers as a\nconstant, with the result that expected population size will\nnot affect the value of offspring under our model for-\nmulation. State-dependent reproductive values also take\naccount of the state into which offspring are born. For\nexample, females may be more likely to disperse if by doing\nso, their offspring are likely to be born into a smaller group\n(and therefore be of higher rank) than if they remain in\ntheir current group. This formulation would greatly in-\ncrease the computational complexity of the model. Fur-\nthermore, given both the potential for error in decision\nmaking and the speed at which group sizes can increase,\nit seems unlikely that this change would greatly affect the\nmodel results. As a result, we chose to use the simpler\nformulation of young raised to independence as a proxy\nfor fitness. A second alternative formulation (related to\nthe previous point) arises because environmental sto-\nchasticity can introduce major changes in selection pres-\nsures that make analyses of mean trajectories misleading.\nConsequently, individuals may adapt their behavior to var-\niability in the environment (Benton and Grant 1996),\nworst-case scenarios (Orzack and Tuljapurkar 2001), or\nsome other form of average. Our model is adaptable to\nalternative formulations such as these, and it would be\ninteresting to determine their consequences for group size\nregulation and intragroup conflict.\nESS models to determine optimal strategies simulta-\nneously for large numbers of interdependent states are\nrarely attempted due to the intensive computation re-\nquired. Our model provides a framework by which ESSs\ncan be derived for individuals in multimember groups of\nsocial species, taking account of the long-term conse-\nquences of decisions. The assumption of decision error is\nlikely to be more realistic than perfect optimization and\nincreases the stochasticity to which group sizes are subject,\nabove that expected from stochastic birth and death events.\nThis suggests a broader distribution of possible group sizes\nthan would be expected under conditions of perfect op-\ntimization and helps to explain the variety of group sizes\nobserved in reality. ESS dispersal and eviction probabilities\ndetermined by our model produce group size distributions\nin line with those seen in the empirical study, especially\nwhen emigrant survival is approximately that recorded in\nthe field. This suggests that long-term fitness consider-\nations may well explain group size regulation in meerkats.\nOur model also suggests that regulation is most likely to\ndepend on eviction of subordinates by dominants, adding\nsupport to our interpretation of observed behaviors.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Mr. and Mrs. H.
