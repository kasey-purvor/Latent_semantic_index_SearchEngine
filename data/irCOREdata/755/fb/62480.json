Introduction \n \nIt is well known that the height reached by tsunami at the coast greatly exceeds wave \nheight in the open ocean, often resulting in widespread coastal inundation. However, \n 1\neven in modern tsunami, although a number of detailed studies of flooding from \nindividual events have been undertaken, no systematic studies across a range of coastal \nsettings are available, making an understanding of tsunami impact imprecise. As a result, \nthe importance of such factors as offshore bathymetry and onshore topography is only \nknown in general terms and such models as have been developed cannot be validated in \ndetail by empirical evidence. The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the \ninformation that the most characteristic tsunami signature - widespread sheets of fine \nparticulate sediment \u2013 may provide in determining the anatomy of the event, including in \nparticular possible flow depth. It takes as an example the sediments deposited by the \nHolocene Storegga Slide tsunami of circa 8000 BP at three sites in eastern Scotland.  \n \n2. Tsunami deposits in the SW Montrose Basin, Scotland \n2.1 The area. The area examined in detail in this paper lies on the south-western shore of \nthe Montrose Basin, eastern Scotland, UK (Figure 1). The Montrose Basin is an estuarine \narea at the mouth of the river South Esk, surrounded by marine terraces. The Basin is \nmesotidal, the present Spring tidal range at Montrose being 4.1m (Admiralty \nHydrographic Department, 1996), and recent work suggests that this is likely to have \nchanged little over the mid-late Holocene (Shennan et al., 2000). The area has \nexperienced glacio-isostatic uplift since the last glaciation (e.g. Cullingford and Smith, \n1980; Smith and Cullingford, 1985; Smith et al., 2006), with marine terraces at several \naltitudes, reflecting former shorelines. The highest marine terraces surrounding the Basin \nwere formed during and following the decay of the last (Late Devensian) ice sheet to \nhave occupied the area. These terraces, dissected by a number of gullies, overlook raised \n 2\nHolocene estuarine silts to seaward. These silts form a level surface, known locally as \n\u201ccarseland\u201d, and for the most part probably a relict saltmarsh. Underlying the silts \n(carseland) and resting upon Late Devensian deposits beneath is a layer of Holocene peat, \nwhich outcrops along the gully sides and at their heads. Within the silts and passing \nlandward into the peat a prominent layer of fine particulate sediment, mainly fine or \nmedium sand, occasionally coarser but with some silt and sometimes containing \nintraclasts of peat, occurs. For convenience, this layer is referred to as a sand layer in this \npaper. The silt surface beneath the sand is generally level and on the grounds of its \nmorphology, lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy is believed to have been the carseland \nsurface that existed before the sand was laid down. The sequence of deposits has been \ndescribed in a number of accounts (e.g. Cullingford and Smith, 1980; Smith et al., 1980; \nSmith and Cullingford, 1985), and the sand interpreted as a deposit of the Holocene \nStoregga Slide tsunami (e.g. A.G. Dawson et al., 1988; Long et al., 1989a; 1989b; Smith \net al., 2004). \n \nIn the area examined in detail (Figure 2), a total of 62 boreholes made to depths of up to \n10m by Smith and Cullingford (1985) and Smith et al. (2004), were supplemented by a \nfurther 15 boreholes in the present study. At the time of the tsunami, the area was a \ncoastal embayment, effectively an extension of the Montrose Basin of the time, and the \ngullies were narrow inlets around that embayment. The sand horizon is extensive and has \nbeen identified in a large number of the boreholes, many spaced only a few metres apart. \nThree sites in this small area will be discussed in detail: gullies at Old Montrose and \nFullerton and a bluff section at Maryton. The techniques of investigation are outlined in \n 3\nSmith et al. (1980), Smith and Cullingford (1985), Shi (1995) and Smith et al. (2004). Of \nparticular relevance to this paper are particle size (textural) analyses of the tsunami \nsediment, in which contiguous 1cm-thick samples were analysed using laser \ngranulometry with samples pre-treated to remove all organic matter. In this paper, \naltitudes are expressed in terms of British Ordnance Datum Newlyn (OD), with present \nday Mean High Water Spring Tides Montrose (MHWS) in parentheses. \n \n2.2 Stratigraphical context of the sand layer and possible direction of tsunami flow. \nAcross the embayment, the sand layer is up to 0.5m thick, and is remarkably consistent in \nits thickness and altitude locally, variations between adjacent boreholes being no more \nthan a few centimentres. As it is followed from the sea inland it increases in thickness \nslightly before decreasing and tapering to disappear in peat at the heads of the gullies. \nFigure 3 shows sections along and across the gully at Fullerton (A-B and C-D, Figure 2), \nbehind the bluff section at Maryton (E-F, Figure 2) and along the gully at Old Montrose \n(G-H, Figure 2).  The sand layer rests upon underlying estuarine silt towards the mouths \nof both the Fullerton and Old Montrose gullies, but can be followed upwards into peat at \nthe heads of these gullies. At Fullerton and Old Montrose, Smith et al. (2004) reported \nmaximum observed sediment run-up at, respectively, 3.9m (reaching an altitude of 7.9m \nOD or 5.8m MHWS) and 1.2m (reaching 6.1m OD or 4.0m MHWS). This was based \nupon the highest altitude reached by the sand above the highest altitude of the silt surface \nbeneath. At Maryton, the tsunami sand rests upon a thin (circa 20cm) peat layer \noverlying basal Late Devensian sediments. Maryton, which comprises mainly a bluff \nsection, lies on what is probably the western side of a former gully, the eastern side of \n 4\nwhich has subsequently been eroded as relative sea levels around the Montrose Basin \nfluctuated during the middle and late Holocene. The base of the sand layer in the section \nstudied at Maryton is at 4.2m OD (2.1m MHWS). \n \nIt seems likely that the tsunami sand was deposited from water that crossed the intertidal \nsurface of the embayment then surged into the gullies when they were inlets in the \ncoastline of the time. A clue to the nature of tsunami flow into this area is provided by the \ndisposition of the sand layer, illustrated for the Fullerton gully in Figure 3 (sections A-B \nand C-D). Here, the layer is seen to rise in elevation towards the head of the gully, but to \nbe almost level across its width. Indeed, whilst sediment run-up reaches a maximum \nobserved value of 3.9m at the head of the gully, the maximum observed run-up value is \nonly 0.4m across its width. Across the area in general, the sand layer is level in the \nembayment but rises to its highest altitude at the heads of the gullies. It is suggested here \nthat this indicates that the momentum of tsunami flow was greatest along the axis of each \ngully. This observation accords with the observations of Wright and Mella (1963) from \nsouth-central Chile following the 1963 Chilean tsunami and with Guiborg et al.\u2019s (1997) \nmodelling of the impact of the 1995 Chilean tsunami in an inlet in French Polynesia. \nAcross the embayment as a whole, the available borehole evidence does not show much \nvariation in the altitude or thickness of the sand layer, even towards the former shoreline. \n \n2.3 Origins of the sand. It seems highly likely that the sand was at least in part derived \nfrom local sources, for two reasons. Firstly, there are peat intraclasts present, probably \nderived from the peat overlying the silt beneath the sand. Secondly, there are extensive \n 5\ndeposits of fine particulate sediment surrounding the Montrose Basin and offshore. Thus \nthe Late Devensian terraces which largely surround the Montrose Basin are mainly \ncomposed of sand and silt, as numerous exposures show (Cullingford and Smith, 1980), \nwhile to seaward a barrier composed of sand and gravel overlying a surface of silty clay \nis present. Crofts (e.g.1980) examined this barrier in detail, while Cullingford and Smith \n(1985) showed that the barrier was contemporary with the carselands, showing that the \nbarrier was probably present at the time of the tsunami, although the barrier probably did \nnot reach as far south at that time. Offshore the sea bed sediments are sand dominated \nwith typically less than 5% finer than 63 microns (British Geological Survey, 1986). At \nthe time of the tsunami, mean tidal levels around the basin lay at circa 2-5m OD (circa 0-\n3m MHWS) as indicated by the silt surface beneath the sand, thus rendering these areas \nof sediment subject to erosion and transport by the tsunami waves.  \n \n2.4 Particle size analysis and depositional episodes. The sand layer exhibits no structures \ndiscernable by eye in either the boreholes or in the available exposures apart from the \noccasional intraclast of peat, but the particle size analysis as determined by laser \ngranulometry shows the sediment to be well sorted (e.g. Smith et al., 2004). The particle \nsize profile is distinctive. Figure 4 shows particle size analyses for contiguous 1cm-thick \nsamples from four boreholes towards the head of the gully at Fullerton, previously \npublished in Smith et al. (2004); from the bluff section at Maryton; and from one \nborehole at Old Montrose. At Fullerton, two fining-upwards sequences are present, the \nupper sequence decreasing in thickness towards the head of the gully. At this site, most \nsamples have a bimodal particle size distribution, with the finer peak increasing in \n 6\npercentage volume towards the top of each sequence as the percentage volume of the \ncoarser peak decreases. At Maryton, bimodality is less pronounced, but two fining-\nupwards sequences are present. At Old Montrose only one sample approaches a bimodal \ndistribution, and a single fining-upwards sequence is present. From the location of the \nthree sites, it appears that there is a pattern of two fining-upwards sequences close to the \npresent Montrose Basin, and one farther inland. In addition, a fining-landwards trend is \nevident at Fullerton, where four boreholes were analysed. Figure 5 shows mean particle \nsize volume for the two sequences at each borehole in the Fullerton gully, and indicates \nthat for each sequence particle size decreases landward. From the mean particle size \nvalues at Fullerton, it would seem unlikely that the two sequences reflect, respectively, \nrun-up and backwash, since mean particle size decreases landward in each sequence \n(although there is a very slight reversal of this trend in the lower sequence at borehole II). \nWhilst it is recognised that tsunami flow onshore can be complex (e.g. Shi, 1995), it is \nargued here that the pattern of fining upwards sequences across this former embayment \nmay indicate that each sequence was the deposit of an individual wave, and that one wave \nreached farther inland than the other, given that two sequences occur at sites near the \nbasin, but only one at the more protected site. Several authors have correlated a given \nfining-upwards particle size sequence with one wave (e.g. Dawson et al., 1991; Goff et \nal., 1998). There is no evidence of erosion of the surface of the lower sequence where \ntwo sequences exist. This may be because the area would have been particularly well \nsheltered. Thus if the complete depositional record is preserved, it seems likely that the \nsite was reached by two waves. \n \n 7\n2.5 Water depth. A striking feature of the particle size profiles is that they show \nconsistent trends, with no major change in sorting towards the surface of the sediment \ncolumn, indicating that the surface of the water from which the sediment was laid down \nlay well above. This is corroborated by the disposition of the tsunami sediment, which is \napparently continuous over much of the area (only four boreholes out of 51 which lie to \nseaward of the inland limit having failed to locate the sand), and which is locally \nconsistent in both surface altitude and thickness, as observed above. Several studies of \ntsunami deposits have remarked on the likelihood that the water surface lay well above \nsediment sheets deposited (e.g. Shi et al., 1993; 1995a; 1995b; Yeh et al., 1993; Kawata \net al., 1999); while others have remarked on the possibility that sand sheets can remain \nlittle altered after deposition (Nishimura and Miyaji, 1995). With these observations in \nmind, it is suggested that the sedimentary characteristics of the tsunami deposit may \nprovide information on the depth of the water in which it accumulated. Recently, Jaffe \nand Gelfenbaum (2005) have speculated that tsunami sediments may hold the key to \nestimates of wave height and velocity. In the following paragraphs a suggestion is made \nas to how flow depth might be estimated. \n \n2.6 Some previous views on the possible deposition of tsunami sand. Previous accounts \nhave speculated on the mode of deposition of tsunami sand sheets. Dawson (1999) and \nDawson and Shi (2000) suggested that deposition could occur during \u201cturnaround\u201d \nperiods when an episode of flow into an area briefly ceased before returning seaward. \nWhilst such periods may occur during tsunami, they are probably short lived, since the \nevidence of fining-landwards particle size profiles and of the pattern of vegetation \n 8\ndisturbance within the sediment (e.g. Nishimura and Miyaji, 1995) are difficult to explain \nwith still water conditions. Indeed, deposition from still water during a \u201cturnaround\u201d \nperiod implies that the rise of the sand layer up hillsides is a drape rather than a reflection \nof run-up, contrary to observations in recent tsunami (e.g. Tuttle et al., 2004). Dawson \nand Shi (2000) have also speculated that deposition could have occurred following \ntsunami flow in a manner analogous to a turbidity current. There is some support for this \nin the area studied here in the graded bedding present and in some evidence of erosion of \nunderlying sediments from the peat intraclasts occasionally visible in the sand. However, \nthis interpretation is thought unlikely at the sites examined in the present study, given the \nlack of a gradient across the widespread intertidal surface which existed before the \ntsunami and the lack of structures diagnostic of turbidity current deposition in the several \nexposures along the bluffs at Maryton. \n \n2.7 A possible mechanism for tsunami sand deposition. It is maintained here that at the \nsites examined, deposition of the sand took place mainly from moving water. Whilst the \nflow of the water would have been largely turbulent, the lack of erosive features on the \nsurface of the sand layer and the consistent nature of the particle size profiles indicates \nthat turbulence reduced as the tsunami surged onshore.  In this area, the surface beneath \nthe tsunami sand is largely of former saltmarsh and areas of mudflat, with peat along the \nshoreline. Such areas, though not without surface roughness, would have been more level \nand consistent than most other surfaces encountered by the tsunami, with relatively less \nfriction, and turbulence may have reduced as flow crossed these areas. Further, the water \nwould in all probability have been heavily charged with sand, given the widespread \n 9\navailability of sediment in the area as discussed above, thus increasing the dynamic \nviscosity of the fluid, as standard equations for flow demonstrate (e.g. Richards, 1982). \nThis would also have reduced turbulence.  \n \nIt is thus suggested here that deposition took place as follows. As each wave of the \ntsunami flowed onshore, the turbulent water contained a considerable volume of sediment \nof all sizes. As velocity decreased, turbulence was reduced and the sediment began to \nsettle out. Fining-upwards sequences developed from each wave during this process, with \ncoarser particles settling out first and finer ones later. Backwash carried sediment not \ndeposited back out to sea. The passage onshore of a sheet of water from each wave, \nheavily laden with sediment gradually settling out in this way would have ensured that a \nsheet of sediment comprising a fining-upwards sequence would have resulted. Under \nthese circumstances, it is maintained that the rate of accumulation of sediment at a given \npoint may somewhat paradoxically have been analagous to the settling rate in still water \nsince there would have been a continuous supply of sediment coming out of entrainment, \nfrom further up-current. It is noted that a number of eye-witness accounts of recent \ntsunami speak of very high volumes of sediment (e.g. Myles, 1985). \n \nIf the considerations articulated above are accepted, then knowing the particle size of the \n  \nsediment it is possible to estimate at least the minimum depth of water from settling rates. \n \nSeveral methods (e.g. Gibbs et al., 1971) are available to predict the settling velocity of \n \ngrains in water. These have been recently reviewed by Soulsby (1997), who noted that \n \nthe Gibbs et al. (1971) settling velocity equation was limited to spherical grains only and \n \n 10\nproposed the use of an alternative equation to predict settling velocities of irregular grains \n \nbased on optimising two coefficients in a combined viscous plus bluff-body drag law \n \nagainst data for irregular grains (Soulsby ibid., p.134). From Soulsby, \n \nWs = \uf06e\/d [(10.362 + 1.049D*3)0.5 \u2013 10.36] for all D*   Eq. 1 \n \nWhere: \n \nWs = settling velocity \n\uf06e  = kinematic viscosity \nd  = median sieve diameter of grains \nD* = Dimensionless Grain Size calculated from: \n \nD*  =  [g(s-1)] 0.333 d Eq 2\n           [   \uf06e2  ] \n \nWhere: \n \ng = acceleration due to gravity (9.81 ms-2) \ns = the ratio of the density of grain and water \n \nd and \uf06e are defined in Eq. 1 \n \n \nIt is suggested that the time taken for the finest particles to settle out individually is likely \nto be the most diagnostic of water depth because these particles will have taken the \nlongest time to settle. From the particle size profiles in this study, it is concluded that \nthese particles were those of the fine sand fraction, which constitutes most of the \nsediment by volume. Finer particles recorded may well have been deposited by \nflocculation (e.g. see McCave et al., 1995), given that the water was saline, or may have \nbeen subject to adhesion by organic material (see for example Droppo, 2001), as implied \nby the occasional presence in the tsunami deposit of fragments of organic material \nrecorded in boreholes and in the section at Maryton. \n \n 11\n The time available for the fine sand in the tsunami deposit to settle from a flooding \nepisode is critical. Assuming that each fining upwards sequence relates to a wave, the \ntime for each sequence would relate to a wave period, although a wave period would be \nthe maximum time, since deposition would not commence until the flow velocity fell to \nthe point where sediment could begin to settle, and a full wave period may not have been \nachieved close to the shore due to wave reflection.   Wave periods in modern tsunami \nhave been estimated by a number of authors, notably Murty (1977), and generally range \nbetween 10 and 100 minutes. Wave periods remain the same as the waves approach the \nshore, as standard texts observe (e.g. Komar, 1976). Table 1 gives the range of water \ndepths for periods of between 10 and 100 minutes for the finest fine sand (the finest \nparticles likely to have settled out individually) based upon equation 1, above, of Soulsby \n(1997) and assuming a salinity of 35 \u2030, a temperature of 10oC and water and sediment \ndensities of respectively 1027 and 2650 kg m-3.   \n \nThe water depth indicated by the sediments would have been that which obtained above \nthe intertidal surface at the time. In the area involved, borehole logs show that the buried \nsaltmarsh surface (perhaps with some areas of mudflat) beneath the tsunami sand horizon \nranges between 3.0m and 4.7m OD (0.9m to 2.6m MHWS). From Table 1, the range of \nwater depths above this horizon inferred on the basis of the possible range of wave \nperiods and settling rates of the finest fine sand is 1.2m to 13.0m. Harbitz (1992, Figure \n11) modelled a wave pattern for the tsunami which developed from what was at the time \ntermed the Second Storegga Slide (the Holocene Storegga Slide), which in the area \noffshore of Montrose saw a small leading elevation wave followed by a major fall in \n 12\nwater levels then a major crest followed by later waves. The wave period modelled was \napproximately 60 minutes. Later, Bondevik et al. (2005, Figure 2) modelled a different \nwave pattern but a similar wave period. Taking 60 minutes as a possible wave period, a \nwater depth of 7.2m is obtained (Table 1), thus 10.2m to 11.7m OD (8.1m to 11.9m \nMHWS) above the saltmarsh surface reached directly before the tsunami in the area. The \nmaximum observed sediment run-up value for Fullerton of 3.9m would imply a tsunami \nrun up of 11.1m (7.2m plus 3.9m), reaching a maximum altitude of 15.1m OD (13.0m \nMHWS). These are maximum figures for the height of the water surface because they \nassume that settling took place during the entire 60 minutes of the wave period, whereas \nas indicated above, settling would not begin until the velocity of the water slowed to \nallow it to take place, and at the shore the residence time of the wave would have been \nreduced by reflection. The estimate of 60 minutes for the wave period would reduce the \nlikelihood of disruption of the wave pattern over short distances as outgoing waves met \nincoming ones, thus allowing the consistent pattern of sedimentation to be achieved. \n \n3. Conclusion \nDetailed study of a sand sheet laid down during the Holocene Storegga Slide tsunami \nnear Montrose, eastern Scotland, UK discloses that in this area: \n      1.   The tsunami deposit was probably derived from local sources. \n2. Flooding took place from two waves. \n3. When the tsunami reached the gully areas, the momentum of flow was \nconcentrated along the axes of the gullies. \n 13\n4. Particle size profiles of the tsunami sand indicate that the water surface lay well \nabove the sediment surface. \n5. The tsunami flow onshore became increasingly less turbulent as the water surged \ninto the embayment and then into the gullies along the shoreline. \n6. Deposition of the tsunami sediment took place in this area primarily during run-\nup. \n7. The consistency in particle size trends allows assumptions to be made about \nsettling rates of the sediment, which indicate that the maximum height of the \nwater surface above the sediment may have reached 7.2m, with a maximum run-\nup of the tsunami at the sites studied of 11.1m.  \nFrom this local study, it is concluded that study of the distribution, morphology, \nstratigraphy and particle size (textural) characteristics of the sheets of fine particulate \nsediment associated with palaeotsunami may provide considerable detail on the anatomy \nof these events. In particular, it may be possible to infer patterns and depths of flow. This \nmay, in turn, enable a better understanding of the impact of such events to be achieved. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors express their gratitude to the many colleagues with whom they have worked \non tsunami sedimentation.
