Introduction \nThe toxins T-2 and HT-2 occur in various cereal crops, especially oats, where they are \nproduced by Fusariumlangsethiae. T-2 toxinis rapidly metabolized to HT-2 toxinwhich \nis also the main metabolite in vivo (1).T-2 toxin, the most toxic trichothecene, is a \npotent inhibitor of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, and shows immunosuppressive \nand cytotoxic effects both in vivo and in vitro (2-3). Recent data collected to evaluate \nthe risk of dietary exposure to Fusariumtoxins by the populations of EU member states \nshowed that T-2 and HT-2 toxins are quite common contaminants in cereals in the EU \n(4). \nF.langsethiae, has been isolated from infected oats, wheat and barley in central and \nnorthern Europe (5-6). This species has been implicated in the production of high levels \nof HT-2 and T-2 mycotoxins in cereals in Norway (7) and in oats in the UK \n(8).However, there is little knowledge of the ecology of this pathogen and it is \nnecessary to develop reliable and fast methods that could allow chemical and ecological \ncharacterisation.Thus, studies on oat-based nutritional media are important when \nscreening the ability of strains to produce these toxins.  \nToday, one of the commonest and quick methods for the characterisation of toxin\/no \ntoxin productionis the agar plug method. This method was introduced by Frisvadand \nFiltenborgin 1983 andup to now has been used in numerous studies to identify the \nrelative ability of strains to produce specific mycotoxins and the amounts produced (9-\n11). \nGenerally,\u00a0 detection\u00a0 of\u00a0 trichothecenes\u00a0 has\u00a0 been\u00a0 performed\u00a0 by\u00a0 ELISA,\u00a0 thin\u2010layer\u00a0\nchromatography\u00a0 (TLC),\u00a0 liquid\u00a0 chromatography\u00a0 (LC)\u00a0 or\u00a0 gas\u00a0 chromatography\u00a0 (GC).\u00a0 Regarding\u00a0\ntype\u00a0 A\u00a0 trichothecenes,\u00a0 due\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 lack\u00a0 of\u00a0 any\u00a0 ultra\u2010violet\u00a0 (UV)\u00a0 absorbing\u00a0 or\u00a0 fluorescent\u00a0\nchromophore,\u00a0 the\u00a0 detection\u00a0 via\u00a0 LC\u2010UV\u00a0 or\u00a0 LC\u2010RID\u00a0 (refractive\u00a0 index\u00a0 detection)\u00a0 is\u00a0 difficult.\u00a0\nPage 4 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n4 \n \nUsually,\u00a0separation\u00a0is\u00a0achieved\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0RP\u2010C18\u00a0column\u00a0with\u00a0methanol\u2010water\u00a0(14:86)\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0mobile\u00a0\nphase\u00a0(12\u201013).Regarding\u00a0UV\u00a0detection,\u00a0 in\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0methanol,\u00a0 interfering\u00a0absorption\u00a0at\u00a0\nlow\u00a0wavelengths,\u00a0and\u00a0 sometimes\u00a0 low\u00a0pH,\u00a0 reduces\u00a0 the\u00a0UV\u00a0absorption.\u00a0Thus,\u00a0UV\u00a0detection\u00a0of\u00a0\ntype\u00a0A\u00a0trichotheceneswas\u00a0only\u00a0applicable\u00a0to\u00a0cultures\u00a0with\u00a0high\u00a0toxin\u00a0concentrations\u00a0or\u00a0used\u00a0to\u00a0\ndiscriminate\u00a0 producing\/non\u2010\u00a0 producing\u00a0 strains\u00a0 just\u00a0 for\u00a0 screening\u00a0 purposes\u00a0 (14\u201015).\u00a0 Several\u00a0\nstudies\u00a0 have\u00a0 described\u00a0 determination\u00a0 of\u00a0 HT\u20102\u00a0 and\u00a0 T\u20102\u00a0 by\u00a0 LC\u00a0 coupled\u00a0 with\u00a0 fluorescence\u00a0\ndetectors\u00a0(FLD)\u00a0after\u00a0derivatization\u00a0(16\u201017).\u00a0The\u00a0trichothecenes\u00a0have\u00a0been\u00a0derivatized\u00a0with\u00a01\u2010\nnaphthoyl\u00a0chloride\u00a0(1\u2010NC);\u00a02\u2010naphthoylchloride\u00a0(2\u2010NC);\u00a01\u2010\u00a0anthroylnitrile\u00a0(1\u2010AN)\u00a0and,\u00a0pyrene\u20101\u2010\ncarbonyl\u00a0 cyanide\u00a0 (PCC).\u00a0 2\u2010NC\u00a0 and\u00a0 PCC\u00a0 performed\u00a0 better\u00a0 than\u00a0 1\u2010ANand\u00a0 1\u2010NC\u00a0 in\u00a0 terms\u00a0 of\u00a0\nsensitivity\u00a0and\u00a0selectivity\u00a0(18).\u00a0\nGC has been the most widely used method, but it requires derivatisation in order to \nobtain good results (7, 19-20), although methods without derivatisation have been \npublished (21). Today LC-MS2is the technique of choice for the determination of type-\nA trichotecenes in foodstuffs (22-25).However, the high cost makes the use of this \ntechnique difficult for routine strain characterization.  \nThe aim of this work was to find a fast and easy-to-use method for the analysis of T-2 \nand HT-2 toxins in cultures grown in vitro on media. In our case the medium consisted \nof 2% (w\/v) ground oats. Two different extraction solvents, 3 different extraction times, \nand two different extract drying procedures were testedusing liquid chromatography  to \noptimize the pro edure. The proposedmethod was tested by quantifying the levels of the \nmycotoxins in in vitrocultures of different Fusariumlangsethiaestrains on an oat-based \nmedium modified to different water availabilities using glycerol.  \n \n2. Material and methods \n2.1. Reagents and standards \nPage 5 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n5 \n \nTrichothecene standards, including T-2 and HT-2 were supplied by Sigma (Sigma-\nAldrich, UK). Acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Fisher \nScientific UK Ltd., UK). All solvents were HPLC grade. Pure water was obtained from \na Milli-R\/Q watersystem (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). \n2.2. Chromatographic analysis \nHPLC equipment consisted of an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system equipped with a \nUV diode-array detector set at 200 nm (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). \nThe column was a Phenomenex\u00ae Gemini C18, 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 3 \u00b5m (Phenomenex, \nMacclesfield, UK) preceded by a Phenomenex\u00ae Gemini C18 3 mm, 3 \u00b5m guard \ncartridge. Signals were processed by Agilent ChemStation software Ver. B Rev: 03.01 \n[317]. Analysis was performed in the gradient mode. Water was solvent A and \nacetonitrile solvent B. Gradient conditions were initiated by holding the mobile phase \ncomposition 3 minutes with 30% B, after that it was changed linearly to 55% B during \n18 min. The composition was then changed to 99% B in 1minute and maintained for 5 \nmin as a cleaning step in order to improve the results. After cleaning, the eluent \ncomposition wasreturned to the initial 30% B. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 1 \nmL min\u22121and injection volume was 50 \u00b5L. \n2.3. Preparation of standard solutions \nT-2 standard was dissolved in acetonitrile at a concentration of 2.0 mg mL-1 and stored \nat -20 \u00baC in a sealed vial until use. HT-2 standard solution in acetonitrile was purchased \nat a concentration of 100.2 \u00b5g mL-1. Working standards (50, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 1, 0.5 and \n0.2 \u00b5g mL-1) were prepared by appropriate dilution of known volumes of the stock \nsolutions with acetonitrile and used to obtain calibration curves for LC-DAD analysis. \n2.4. Medium preparation and fungal culture preparation \nPage 6 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6 \n \nMilled oats were prepared by homogenisation for 5 mins. Five different sets of a \nmixture of 2% (w\/v) oat flour in water were prepared and 2%(w\/v) agar was added. The \nculture medium was prepared and after autoclaving, the required volume of T-2 and \nHT-2 toxin stock solution were added (at around 45\u00baC) to get the desired concentration \n(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 5mgKg-1). The medium was vigorously shaken and poured into \nPetri dishes. Controls consisted of non-spiked culture medium. \nFor experiments withsix F. langsethiaestrains(Ref. 2004\/57 and 2004\/59 from UK; 44P \nand 88E from Norway; 05010 and 05014 from Finland), the medium was modified with \nglycerol to the required water activity levels (aw; 0.99, 0.95). The sixstrains of F. \nlangsethiae were  inoculated using agar discs (4 mm diameter) at three points \nequidistant apart onto freshlyprepared 2% oatmedium and incubated at 25 \u00baC for 12 \ndays.  \n2.5. Sample preparation \nUsing a cork borer, five-six discs of agar (4 mm diameter) weighing around 0.75 grams \nwere removed from the spiked plates and placed in previously weighed 2 mL volume \nsafe-lock Eppendorf tubes. A total of 3 replicates per treatment were collected, weighed \nagain and immediately frozen at -20\u00baC freezer.   \n2.6. Extraction procedur s \nSamples were thawed and extracted by mixing the agar plugs with one ml of a mixture \nof water and organic solvents. Afterwards the tubes were shaken at 150 rev min-1 at \n25\u00baC in the dark in an orbital shaker. They were then centrifuged at 1150 g for 15 min \nand 750 \u00b5L of supernatant were transferred to a 2 mL chromatographysilanized amber \nvial.Extracts were completely dry in a stream of nitrogen.Dry extract was redissolved in \n300 \u00b5l of acetonitrile:water (50:50 v\/v) and injected in the chromatograph. \na) Comparison of extraction solvents \nPage 7 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7 \n \nExtraction was made using two different extraction solvents, acetonitrile:water (84:16 \nv\/v) or methanol:water (80:20 v\/v)for 45 minutes. Then samples were dried overnight in \nan air forced 50\u00baC dryer, and analysed using LC-DAD. \nb) Comparison of extraction times \nOnce the best extraction solvent was identified, different extraction times were tested \n(30, 60 or 90 minutes). \nc) Comparison of drying methods \nThe best solvent and best time were used and finally samples were dried using two \ndifferent methods. One set was dried placing the tubes overnight in a forced air  dryer at \n50\u00baC  and the other set was dried under a gentle stream of N2 at 50\u00baC in an aluminium \nheated block. \n2.8. Statistical analysis \nStatistical analysis was performed using the package STATISTICA 8 (StatSoft\u00ae Inc., \n2007. Tulsa, OK, USA). \n \n3. Results \n3.1. Comparison of extraction solvents \nTen samples (5 per treatment) of each concentration were defrosted and toxin extraction \nwas made using the two different mixtures:acetonitrile:water (84:16 v\/v) or \nmethanol:water (80:20 v\/v)for 30 minutes and then  analysed using the LC-DAD \nprocedure.There were no statistically significant differences (p> 0.05) between \ntreatments. Finally,a methanol:water (80:20 v\/v) mixture was selected for further \nexperiment duetothe lower consumption of methanol and also its lower price in \ncomparison to acetonitrile. \n \nPage 8 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n8 \n \n3.2. Comparison of extraction times \nFifteen samples of each concentration, five for each different time treatment were used. \nThe mean recoveries and relative standard deviations (RSD) obtained extracting toxins \nafter different times are shown in Table 1. In general an increase in the mean recovery \nwas observed when the extraction time was increased. HT-2 and T-2 recoveries for the \nlower concentration (0.1 mgKg-1 of agar) were predominantly higher than 100% and \nRSD values greater than 10%, showing that this value was near the limit of \ndetection.With all the other concentrations the best results for both toxins were observed \nwhen the extraction step lasted 90 minutes. In both cases recoveries were higher than \n95% and RSD values (excluding both toxins at the lowest concentration) were smaller \nthan 7%. \n \n3.3. Comparison of drying methods \nSix samples of 0.5, 1 and 5\u00b5g of both toxinsg-1 of agar were defrosted. Samples \nwere extracted using the best options described before and 3 samples of each \nconcentration treatment driedusing forcedair at 50\u00baC overnight. The remaining samples \nwere dried under a gentle stream of N2 at 50\u00baC in an aluminium heated block. \nConcerning HT-2 toxin, drying with both methods gave very similar results despite a \nslight reduction of 5.3 % of the toxin being observed when samples were dried \novernight ina dryer.  \nRegarding T-2 toxin, larger differences were found. In this case values of toxin after \ndrying using forced air at 50\u00baC overnight were 12.3 % lower than those obtained using \nN2 drying. Based on these results, drying with a gentle stream of N2 at 50\u00baC in an \naluminium heated block was selected as the best method. \n \nPage 9 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n9 \n \n3.4. Method performance \nDetermination of T-2 and HT-2 toxins was carried out using a LC-DAD and extracting \nthe chromatogram signal obtained at \u03bb=200.4 nm.  Figure 1A shows a chromatogram \nobtained after injection of a mixture of toxin standards containing 0.05\u00b5g of HT-2 and \n0.05\u00b5g of T-2. Figure 1B shows the chromatogram obtained after 90 min extraction of \nan oats-based medium spiked with T-2 and HT-2 (0.25mg Kg-1 of agar) using \nmethanol:water (80:20 v\/v), corresponding to 0.015 \u00b5g of each toxin per injection. \nHT-2 and T-2 peaks were observed at11.78 and 17.66min, respectively.  Run time was \n20 minutes and after each injection a cleaning step was performed in order to improve \nresults and avoid \u2018ghost\u2019 peaks in the next run. Total time used for each sample was \naround 35minutes. Direct injection without clean-up providedclean chromatograms and \nflat baselines  allowingvery good integration of the T-2 and HT-2toxin peaks.  \nThe limit of detection (LOD) was calculated according to the following equation (Long \nand Winefordner, 1983)(26): \n \nWhere,  is the concentration mean and Sn the standard deviation. The limit of \nquantification (LOQ) was calculated according to the next equation: \n \nLC-DAD limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) were 0.1612 and \n0.2294 mg Kg-1 agar for HT-2 and 0.1648 and 0.2541 mg Kg-1 agar for T-2, \nrespectively.  \nAccording to the results obtained, extraction of oats-based medium with methanol:water \n(80:20 v\/v) for 90 minutes, drying with a gentle stream of N2 at 50\u00baC and subsequent  \nanalysis by LC-DAD was  the optimum condition for to analysis HT-2 and T-2 in \nculture media. \nPage 10 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n10 \n \nThe mean recovery for HT-2and T-2 on oat-based media spiked at a level from 0.25 to 5 \nmgKg-1 of agar was 101.28 \u00b13.11% and 99.0 \u00b11.53% respectively.  \nThe regression coefficients (r) for T-2 and HT-2 were all >0.998. The results of the \nstudy reflected that the use of the proposed method gave clean chromatograms and high \nrecoveries in the range between 0.25 and 5 mg of T-2 and HT-2Kg-1of agar. \nPrecision was calculated in terms of intra-day repeatability (n=5) and inter-day \nreproducibility (3 different days) on samples containing 1 mgKg-1of agar of both T-2 \nand HT-2 toxins. The RSDfor intra-day repeatability ranged from 4.5to 7.8%. The inter-\nday reproducibility was <10% in all cases.  \n \n3.6. Application to F. langsethiae cultures in oats-based culture medium \nThe method proposed was applied to investigate the T-2 and HT-2 production ability of \n6 F. langsethiae strainsisolated from oats from different countries of northern Europe. \nOat-based media were modified to0.99 and 0.95aw using glycerol.A sample \nchromatogram obtained in these analyses is shown in Figure 2.No interfering peaks \nwere observed in glycerol-modified water availability media. This shows that HT-2 and \nT-2 toxin were easily analysed using the proposed method. Results for all samples are \nshown in Table 2. \n \n4. Discussion \nThis study considered different aspects of the analysis procedures such as extraction \nefficiency, sample processing and trichothecene type A detection. It has shown that \nextraction with methanol:water (80:20 v\/v) for 90 minutes, drying with N2 and \nsubsequent analysis by LC-DAD is an appropriate method for detecting HT-2 and T-2 \ntoxin production in cultures of F. langsethiae grown on oat-based media. \nPage 11 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n11 \n \nThere are a myriad of different extraction mixtures which have previously been used for \nHT-2 and T-2 toxin. Among them, acetonitrile or methanol mixtures with waterhave \nbeen the most common (16, 20, 27). In the present study both gave good results.  No \nsignificant differences were found after statistically analyzing mean recoveries using \nboth options and the final selection was made based on the lower amount of organic \nsolvent used in the methanol mixture, and the higher cost of  acetonitrile.  \nAlthough many studies have describedproblems with DAD for type Atrichothecenes \n(12, 20, 28)our results show that, under the conditions used in this study, detection of \nHT-2 and T-2 is possible in Fusariumlangsethiae cultures containing only 0.23 and \n0.25mg of toxinkg-1agar, respectively. Culture media containing only 2% of freshly \nmilled oats were used. Under these conditions the fungi are able to grow and produce \nboth toxins but the concentration of the cereal is low enough to allow analysis by the \nproposed method. Since this approach was first investigated more than 20 years ago, the \nimprovements showed here would depend on improvements in the chromatographic \nequipment (DAD equipment and stationary phase) and in the better quality of organic \nsolvents available today, because of their enhanced purity, and lower absorption at \nreduced wavelengths. \nThe proposed method doesnot require any derivatisation process, and the extract is \ninjected directly into the system. In this way separation of HT-2 and T-2 using a C18 \nanalytical column, widely used in mycotoxin analysis, can be done in around 35 min per \nsample, including the column washing. \nPotential application to real F. langsethiae samples was demonstrated by the results \nobtained in the analysis of both toxins in 12-day cultures of 6 different strains. The \nmethod provided clear chromatograms with no interfering peaks in all media including \nexperiments carried out using glycerol to modify the media aw. \nPage 12 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n12 \n \n \n5. Conclusions \nThe present method provides a rapid system for detecting production of HT-2 and T-2 \nin cultures of F. langsethiae grown on oat-based media.For physiological and ecological \nstudies it has several advantages over other conventional methodswhich use large \namounts of natural substrates or culture media, and subsequently, are quite costly in \nterms of solvents and amount of time required. The simplicity of the method, despite the \ncereal composition of the medium,makes it very useful for screening approaches to \nexamine intra-strain variation and effect of fungicides on control of HT-2 and T-2 \ntoxins. A further advantage is that the extracts are very clean allowing the analysis by \nLC-DAD, without any clean-up or timeconsuming derivatisation steps. \n \n6.
