Walker1 and James J. Carroll2 \n \n1Department of Physics, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7XH, UK \n2Department of Physics and Astronomy, Youngstown State University,  \nYoungstown, Ohio 44555, USA \n \nIntroduction \n \n\u201cBut you\u2019ve no idea what a difference it makes, mixing it with other things\u201d [1]. \n \nIn this new age of radioactive beams for nuclear physics research, it is timely to \nreflect on the enduring role of nuclear isomers, i.e. excited, metastable states of \nnuclei. Heroic experiments with tiny quantities of isomer targets point the way \ntowards the wide vistas of isomer beams, and new possibilities confront our ingenuity \nat the interface between nuclear and atomic physics. It is the relatively long half-lives \nof isomers that lead to their special status. \n \nThe prediction by Soddy in 1917 [2] that a single nuclide might have states which are \n\u201cdifferent in their stability and mode of breaking up\u201d was soon followed by Hahn\u2019s \nobservations in 1921 of UZ and UX2, now known as 234Pa and 234mPa. However, \nisomers only became well recognised in 1936, with von Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s explanation in \nterms of angular momentum: high angular momentum transitions are slow. So \nsuccessful were isomers at accounting for multiple half-lives that, it can be argued, \nthe discovery of uranium fission in 1938 had been significantly delayed. Isomers went \non to be cornerstones of the nuclear shell model, and even the collective model owes \nmuch to isomers. A classic example is 180mHf, which decays through a sequence of \nstates, interpreted by Bohr and Mottelson [3] as having energies characteristic of a \nquantum rotor. The energy gap associated with isomers in even-even nuclides also \ntells us much about the pairing interaction. \n \nThe place of isomers in contemporary nuclear structure investigations is illustrated in \nthe following paragraphs. Other recent reviews include those of Walker and Dracoulis \n[4,5] and Walker and Carroll [6].  \n \nExtreme isomers \n \nMost isomers can be characterised as shell-model states involving one or two \u2013 but \neven up to about ten \u2013 specific, unpaired nucleon orbitals. The isomer-related orbitals \ntypically couple to make higher-spin states than other couplings at similar energy, so \nthat isomer decay necessitates the emission of high-spin and\/or low-energy radiation, \nresulting in their long half-lives. In the case of deformed nuclei with an axis of \nsymmetry, a key feature is the orientation of the angular-momentum vector, with a \nprojection, K, on the symmetry axis that is approximately conserved, leading to the \noccurrence of K isomers. The close connection with shell-model orbits means that an \nisomer can be considered to be a \u201csimple\u201d state, with the bulk of the wavefunction \nbeing well defined. The blocking of pairing correlations in multi-particle isomers \nleads to them being, in a sense, even simpler than ground states. Nevertheless, the \nobserved radiations from isomers frequently violate selection rules, and there is a \n sensitive dependence on low-amplitude wavefunction admixtures [7]. Some of these \nfeatures are schematically illustrated in Figure 1. The remaining principal class of \nisomers is that of shape isomers, exemplified by fission isomers, where it is a shape \nchange rather than an angular-momentum change that is responsible for the long half-\nlife. Using an energy-spin representation, as shown in Figure 2, the different isomer \ntypes can be broadly separated by their general origins, although there are overlaps, \nsuch as K traps being also yrast traps if they lie on the yrast line (the locus of states \nwith lowest energy at each spin value). \n \n \nFigure 1: While isomers can be considered to have simple shell-model \nconfigurations, their decay radiations are sensitive to many influences. \n \n \n \nFigure 2: Schematic representation of isomer types in energy-spin space. \n  \nIn order to appreciate the range of isomers found in nature, we will discuss some \nextreme examples \u2013 see Table I. First, however, a comment is needed as to what half-\nlife is necessary for an excited nuclear state to be called an \u201cisomer\u201d. This half-life is \nill-defined, but is usually taken to be long enough to permit an isomer and its decay \nradiations to be separated from the plethora of \u201cprompt\u201d radiations from nuclear \nreactions. For the purposes of the present discussion, the minimum half-life is taken to \nbe 5 ns.  \n \nTable I: Examples of extreme isomers \n \nNuclide Half-life        Spin (\u0127)   Energy Attribute  Ref \n \n \n12Be           ~500 ns      0 2.2 MeV low mass  [8] \n  94Ag  300 ms     21   6 MeV proton decay  [9] \n152Er     11 ns  ~36 13 MeV high spin and energy [10] \n180Ta  >1016 y     9 75 keV  long half-life  [11] \n229Th    ~5 h    3\/2    ~7.6 eV low energy  [12] \n270Ds    ~6 ms ~10     ~1 MeV high mass  [13] \n \nThe half-life range in Table I covers 33 orders-of-magnitude. The observed decay \nmodes, even from this short list, include \u03b1 (270Ds), \u03b2 ( 94Ag), \u03b3 (152Er), p (94Ag) and 2p \n(94Ag) emission. Note the absence of neutron emission. The 152Er isomer at 13 MeV is \nneutron (and proton) unbound, but such decay is inhibited by the centrifugal barrier. \nWe can speculate that neutron radioactivity may soon be discovered from as-yet-\nunknown long-lived isomers in neutron-rich nuclides.  \n \nThe extremely low energy, ~7.6 eV, of the 229Th isomer has attracted considerable \nattention. One possible application is to test the constancy of fundamental constants \n[14].  \n \nAn isomer can be longer lived than its ground state. For example, there is a factor of \nabout sixty between the ~6 ms isomer in 270Ds and its ~100 \u0004s ground state. Indeed, \nthis feature may apply more widely to superheavy nuclides [15] and thus could \nprovide significant experimental advantages. Conversely, at the predicted superheavy \n\u201cisland of stability\u201d, if ground-state half-lives are too long (e.g. 1 hour) for the \ndetection of time-correlated single-atom decays, it may yet be possible to identify \ndecays from short-lived isomers. Perhaps there are already cases where superheavy \nisomers, rather than their ground states, have unknowingly been detected. \n \nFrom this brief discussion, it is evident that, aside from interest in the structure of \nisomers themselves, they can serve as \u201ctools\u201d or \u201cstepping stones\u201d as we reach out to \nsearch for exotic phenomena, especially as we explore the limits of nuclear stability. \nAnother example is 254No [16] where highly excited isomers provide information \nabout orbitals that may form the ground-state structure of heavier nuclides; and a \nwealth of new information is coming from projectile-fragmentation reactions, as \nperformed at GANIL, GSI and NSCL. These reactions produce a vast range of \nnuclides, both proton rich and neutron rich, which can be identified by their mass-to-\ncharge (A\/q) ratio on an ion-by-ion basis, within about 500 ns of their formation. The \nbest sensitivity to nuclear structure, through measuring the subsequent decay \n radiations, is for isomers that decay on a \u0004s time scale, which minimises random \nevents. Early work of this kind was already sensitive to isomeric-ion rates of less than \none per second, and experimental techniques are improving rapidly [17].  \n \nIsomer targets \n \nIn principle, isomers can be used for the full range of nuclear reactions that are open \nto ground states. However, there is only one naturally occurring, effectively \u201cstable\u201d \nisomer, 180mTa, and this is nature\u2019s rarest stable nuclide. On the positive side for \nisomer experiments, the ground state is unstable and \u03b2  decays with an 8-hour half-life, \nbut natural tantalum is only 0.01% 180mTa, the remainder being 181Ta. Despite the \ndifficulties, enriched targets have been made, even in sufficient quantities for photon \nscattering experiments. Since the stellar nucleosynthesis and survival of 180mTa \npresent a long-standing puzzle, the laboratory photo-destruction of the isomer, \nthrough its ground state, gives vital information regarding possible stellar synthesis \nenvironments. Belic et al. [18] identified single-step photo-destruction resonances at \nphoton energies down to 1010 keV. This was subsequently shown to fit well with \nlevel-scheme information, enabling the details of the photo-destruction pathway to be \nidentified [19], as illustrated in Figure 3. Note that the minimum photon energy of \n1010 keV is, in this case, much higher than the isomer energy of 75 keV. In addition, \nmulti-step photo-destruction at lower photon energies has been predicted to be \nimportant in stellar environments [20]. \n \n \nFigure 3: Simplified scheme showing 180mTa photo-excitation, with decay to \nthe ground state [19]. Energies (in italics) are in keV. \n \nRadioactive isomer targets have also been made. A remarkable case is 178m2Hf, a 31-\nyear isomer at an excitation energy of 2.45 MeV. This has a unique combination of \nhigh energy and long half-life, arising from a K = 16, 4-quasiparticle configuration. \nTargets with more than 1014 atoms of 178m2Hf have been used for several nuclear \nphysics experiments, such as deuteron scattering [21], but target impurities have \nlimited the quality of the data obtained. Attempts at photo-destruction of the isomer \nhave been controversial [22], but so far only upper limits have been reliably \ndetermined [23] in the photon energy range 5 \u2013 100 keV.  \n  \nIsomer beams \n \nThe question naturally arises, in view of the high intensities of radioactive beams soon \nto be available, as to whether isomers would make better beams than targets. Compare \nthe background of 105 decay\/s from 1014 atoms of 178m2Hf, making up some small \nfraction of a target, with the near-zero background that could be obtained from 106 \n178m2Hf ion\/s in a purified beam. It may then be possible, for example, to look for \nCoulomb  excitation, through a 0.33 MeV, E2 transition, to the I = 14 member of the \nground-state band [24], and thereby test the high degree of K mixing that has been \ninferred by Hayes et al. [25]. This would be a form of isomer photo-destruction, but \nnow with a substantial energy release (2.45 MeV) compared to the energy of \nexcitation (0.33 MeV). \n \nHowever, a different perspective should also be considered. Once isomer beams are \nunder discussion, then 178m2Hf is not so special from an experimental point of view. \nThere are numerous highly excited isomers with T1\/2 > 500 ns, surviving long enough \nfor mass separation and\/or ion-by-ion A\/q identification. A selection of such isomers, \nwith energy >2 MeV, is illustrated in Figure 4.  \n \n \nFigure 4: Chart of nuclides, illustrating a selection of highly excited isomers \n(dots) that are long enough lived for secondary-reaction measurements. \nNaturally occurring nuclides are shown as squares. \n \nPioneering experiments at RIKEN, Japan, have been performed with isomer beams, \nproduced using inverse heavy-ion, fusion-evaporation reactions in conjunction with a \nrecoil filter. Measurements include the Coulomb excitation of a 2 \u0004s, K = 8 isomer in \n174Hf [26], and secondary fusion reactions with a 1 \u0004s, I = 49\/2 isomer in 145Sm [27]. \nHowever, to date, the limitations of low beam intensity, low beam purity and poor \nbeam optics have placed severe restrictions on the quality of the information that can \nbe obtained. Now we are entering a new era for radioactive beams in general, and for \nisomer beams in particular. A key aspect for isomer beams will be the ability to \nseparate the isomeric states from their respective ground states, and several methods \nare available. \n  \nAn outstanding capability has already been demonstrated at ISOLDE, CERN. Copper \nisomers and ground states have been separated by laser resonance ionisation. In the \ncase of 68Cu, a purified beam of the I = 6 isomer (T1\/2 = 4 m, 722 keV) was \naccelerated to 200 MeV and Coulomb excited by 120Sn target nuclei [28]. A notable \nfeature was the detection of a \u03b3-ray cascade back to the ground state, bypassing the \nisomer. This ISOL method requires an isomer with T1\/2 \u2265 1 s.  \n \nAlso requiring second or longer half-lives is the storage-ring technique developed at \nGSI for fragmentation reaction products [29]. The different orbits of electron-cooled \nbeams have been shown to give the capability of isomer separation by insertion of a \nmechanical \u201cscraper\u201d. Alternatively, there are special cases such as 212Po, where the \nground state is short lived (0.3 \u0004s) compared to the isomer (45 s) so that a 212mPo \nbeam would already be purified by the time it was cooled. Finally, for \u0004s isomers it is \npossible to use delayed-coincidence techniques to select isomer-related events, for \nexample by requiring Coulomb excitation \u03b3 rays to be time correlated with \u03b3 rays that \ncome from the isomer decay. The many possibilities need careful evaluation. \n \nAtomic-nuclear interface \n \nThe 7 hour, I = 21\/2 isomer in 93Mo, at 2.43 MeV, presents an unusual situation, \nillustrated in Figure 5. The structurally related 17\/2 state is just 5 keV higher in \nenergy than the isomer. It has been estimated that, in a plasma at a temperature above \n5x106 K, the isomer decay rate would be enhanced by a factor of ~106, largely due to \nthe predicted NEEC (nuclear excitation by electron capture) process [30]. NEEC is \nthe inverse of electron conversion, which is well known often to dominate over \u03b3-ray \nemission for low-energy transitions, but NEEC itself has yet to be observed in any \nnuclide. The 7 hour isomer in 93Mo seems to be a candidate for a radioactive beam \nwith which to explore such a process. Indeed, the release of 2.43 MeV isomer energy \ninitiated by a 5 keV excitation could have wider interest. This is just one example of \nusing an isomer to give a prominent signal (several high-energy \u03b3 rays) when excited \nby relatively low-energy photons. There are many more possibilities represented in \nFigure 4. \n \n \nFigure 5: Energy levels of 93Mo, with a 7 hour isomer at 2.43 MeV. \n Gamma-ray laser \n \nIsomers have been associated with the quest for a \u03b3-ray laser, a long-standing dream \nthat is perhaps as challenging as the search for controlled fusion power.  The first \nconcrete suggestions for a laser that utilized nuclear excited states as upper and lower \nlasing levels appeared in the literature in 1963 [31], following an earlier, previously \nclassified Russian patent [32].  It is interesting how soon these works came after the \nfirst demonstration of optical lasing, but perhaps more amazing is that the \nfundamental recognition that stimulated emission was possible in nuclei came as early \nas 1926 [33]. \n \nA \u03b3-ray laser would require a difficult synthesis of natural parameters and technical \nachievements, a challenge that has not yet been surmounted.  In any laser, the most \nbasic requirement is a population inversion between paired quantum states that serve \nas upper and lower laser levels.  Stimulated emission of the corresponding \nelectromagnetic decay transition gives the laser radiation, with repeated re-excitation \nof the upper laser level \u201cpumping\u201d the inversion and repeated stimulation of the \nemission increasing the amplification.  Such a repetition is unlikely for a \u03b3-ray laser, \ndue to the difficulty in providing efficient reflection of high-energy photons. \n \nIt is in the preparation of a population inversion that isomers have been proposed to \nplay a major part.  The greatest impediment to the creation of a \u03b3-ray laser has been \nthe inherent conflict (the \u201cgraser dilemma\u201d [34]) between the pumping of a population \ninversion and the requirement that the linewidth for the lasing transition be \nmaintained as close to the natural width as possible.  Various methods have been \nsuggested by which to preserve the natural transition linewidth, such as using the \nM\u00f6ssbauer effect or laser-cooled ensembles, but strong irradiation of a laser material \nto provide an inversion could easily destroy the narrow linewidth.  A nuclear analogue \nof the standard four-level laser scheme, with nuclei beginning in a long-lived isomer \ninstead of the ground state, might reduce the pump fluxes (by photons, neutrons or \nions) to a level that preserves the linewidth.  So far, no system of suitable levels with \nthe necessary transition probabilities and lifetimes has been found in any nuclide.  It is \nworth mentioning that an extension of atomic processes like quantum interference \nmight be possible, eliminating the competing absorption of laser photons by the lower \nlaser level in a process called gain without inversion [35]. \n \nThe field of \u03b3-ray lasers thus remains dependent on further innovation. One key step \nwould be the demonstration of isomer energy release induced by low-energy (<< 1 \nMeV) photons [36]. This is where, as discussed earlier, radioactive beams may be \nneeded. \n \nOutlook \n \nIt is well recognised that radioactive beams are opening up the nuclear landscape. In \nthis brief review, we have tried to show that isomers give an added dimension to these \nradioactive-beam developments, further extending the nuclear physics horizons. \nMoreover, isomer beams will offer unique possibilities to explore new physics at the \natomic-nuclear interface. We must expand our mental horizons, not just our physical \nhorizons, if we are fully to exploit the opportunities, and there is plenty of scope for \nnew ideas. \n  \nThis work has been supported by the UK EPSRC and AWE, and by the US AFOSR \nunder contract FA9550-05-1-0486. \n \n[1] L.
