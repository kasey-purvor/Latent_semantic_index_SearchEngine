Hannah Arendt suggests that the absence of this primary fact from \nhistories of thought represents a significant lacuna in political and philosophical \ntraditions. For Arendt natality, the capacity to begin, is the foundational fact of all \nthought, all politics and all action. Without some fundmental understanding of the \nplace of birth, there can, she suggests, be no social change, no human future. \nArendt\u2019s insistence on thinking birth as the basis for politics is radical in the context of \na European tradition so overwhelmingly  preoccupied with death, terror and \nmourning. Perhaps in Arendt\u2019s natal thinking lie the seeds of an alternative, future- \norientated politics which might challenge the predominant neo-liberalism: An ideology \nthat Lauren Berlant eloquently describes as \u2018the capitalist destruction of life in the \nproject of making value\u2019 (2007: 282).  \n \nHowever, for Arendt natal politics bears no relation to childbirth and the reproductive \nsphere. The labours of women (social reproduction) are for Arendt hidden within the \nprivate realm of the household---whilst of course being absolutely foundational to and \nsustaining the public sphere. Birth, Arendt insists, is an experience \u2019beyond speech\u2018 \nwhich is `antipolitical by definition\u2019 (1958: 63). Indeed for Arendt, the public sphere \ndepends on the fact that `man does not know where he comes from\u2019 (1958: 63). So \ndespite the radical break from tradition suggested by Arendt\u2018s concept of natality, her \ninsistence on separating the concept of birth, from the subjects who birth, places it within \na masculinist tradition in which birth only ever appears as `birth without women\u2018. This is a \ntradition in which, as Luce Irigaray puts it, \u2018every utterance, every statement is \n...developed and affirmed by covering over the fact that being's unseverable relation to \nthe mother-matter has been buried\u2019 (1985: 162).  \n When birth is represented within European philosophical and literary traditions, it is the \ngift of men or male gods---`Zeus-given` (Arendt, 1958: 63).The history of philosophy and \nliterature are littered with male births,  metaphorical births in which birth is imagined as a \nmasculine or divine act of creation (see Tyler, 2000).  Michelangelo\u2019s famous Sistine \nchapel painting, The Creation of Adam in which the finger of God gives life, is one of the \nmost vivid examples of male procreation. Birth has been systematically disembodied and \nappropriated by scientists, philosophers and artists.  As the poet Anne Sexton expressed \nit: \n \n I have put a padlock \n on you, Mother, dear dead human (Sexton, 1972: 75) \n \nThe foundational matricide inherent within  European thought is a well-rehearsed \nfeminist argument (see Jacobs, 2009). Over a forty year period feminist scholarship from \na variety of disciplines has traced, uncovered and critiqued masculinist appropriations of \nbirth and the correlative abjection of maternal subjects from European histories of \nthought and representation (see Luce Irigaray 1985, Iris-Marion Young 1990, Adriana \nCavavero 1998, Bracha Ettinger 2004).  \n \nAnd yet, women\u2019s \u2018troubling talent for making other bodies\u2019 remains at the heart of \nlived sexual inequalities (Donna Harraway 1991:253).  To take one example, a recent \nBritish Government Report, `Fairness and Freedom: The Final Report of the \nEqualities Review` states, `Our new research reveals clearly that there is one factor \nthat above all leads to women\u2019s inequality in the labour market \u2013 becoming mothers.\u2019 \n(2007: 66). Despite a raft of equal opportunities legislation since the 1970s, 7% of all \npregnant women in Britain lose their jobs each year as a consequence of becoming \npregnant and woman with children under 11 are the most discriminated group in the \nBritish workforce (ibid). Furthermore, the `Fairness and Freedom` report reveals that \nmaternal inequalities impact on all women of child-bearing age, because your \nlikelihood of being employed at all is index-linked to your perceived capacity to give \nbirth.  Indeed, as Christine Battersby argues, all women, whether `infertile, post-\nmenopausal or childless',  are assigned, 'a subject- position linked to a body that has \nperceived potentialities for birth. (1998:16 )  It is important that feminists connect \nthese everyday and ordinary discriminations to the abjection of maternal subjects \nexplored in feminist theoretical work. Sacking women from their jobs because they \nhave identified as `maternal subjects\u2018, and abjecting them to the `private sphere` of \ndomestic labour, illustrates in miniature the classic structure of `the human condition` \ndescribed by Arendt fifity years ago. The context seems dramatically differently, but if \nwe probe  beneath the surface we are returned to the same fundamental \nproblematic\u2014women are no longer confined to  private spheres, but they are only \nable to enter the public sphere through processes of maternal abjection\u2014painful \nprocesses of splitting and disavowal.  Even when women accomplish this process \nand achieve some degree of `equality\u2018 they will neverthless be continually \ninterpellated by their relation to the maternal. My claim here is that natality remains a \npressing political question for feminism. \n  \nToo often feminist scholarship on birth and motherhood has remained atomized, \neach generation writing as though stumbling into motherhood for the first time. There \nhas been a failure to find a way to resolve these questions inter-generationally--to \nrecognize that the politics of birth is the politics of generation. In positioning birth, and \nthose who birth, at the centre of politics, feminism needs to find ways to hold together \ndiverse work in this field so it can be inherited. Until recently there have been few \nsucessful attempts to consolidate interdisciplinary research on birth and the maternal. \nThe Canadian based Association for Research on Mothering (ARM), founded in \n1998, was, until recently, the only international feminist organization in this area. \nHowever, the emergence of Mapping Maternal Subjectivities, Identities and Ethics, a \nnetwork co-founded by Lisa Baraitser and Sigal Spigel in 2007, consisting of a \ndiverse grouping of more than a hundred social scientists, humanities scholars, \nnovelists, perfomance artists, film-makers, and psychotherapists, and the launch of a \njournal, Studies in the? Maternal (2009-), suggests that this field  is finally having its \nown re-naissance.  \n \nThis special issue emerged out of a workshop, Maternal Bodies (2005) and a \nconference Birth (2007), organised by Caroline Gatrell and myself at Lancaster \nUniversity. The articles and shorter papers introduce a selection of current feminist \nwork on the maternal and birth. Important and established scholars, such as the art \ntheorist Rosemary Betterton and geographer Robyn Longhurst, appear alongside \nearly career scholars and artists. All of the contributions in this issue are concerned, \nin different ways, with the representation of birth and questions of maternal agency. \nHow can birth be thought and visualised differently? As the (problematic) cyclical \nstucture of feminist work in this field might suggest, these questions have been \nexplored in some depth in feminist theory and art practices from the 1970s onwards \nHowever, I want to imagine that a shift is taking place.;a movement from an abject \nasethetics towards the creation of a `life-full` natal asethetics which cannot be \nsubsumed back within deathly abject paradigms (see Tyler, 2009).   \n \nThis themed issue on birth emerges at an historical juncture when taboos on \nrepresenting childbirth are being broken.  If the 1970s marked the rise of what \nBerlant termed `foetal celebrity\u2018 (1997: 124) and the 1990s witnessed the breaking of \na  taboo on the visibility of the pregnant body, in the noughties we have witnessed \nthe emergence of graphic representations of childbirth within the public sphere (see \nTyler, 2001).  Childbirth is now visible across a range of popular media: it  has \nbecome televisual. In 2006 the reality television company Endemol  brought British \nviewers Birth Night Live, two hours of live television broadcast from a hospital \nmaternity unit. The Discovery Channel\u2019s Birth Day and Deliver Me! are two of several \nhugely popular television serials which follow (US) women through late pregnancy \nand into childbirth. These television shows emerged out of a grassroots trend to \nrecord childbirth on home movie cameras. As digital cameras have `democratised` \nmovie making, the trend to film childbirth has grown. As Robyn Longhurst examines \nin this issue, the emergence of online video sharing platforms, such as Youtube, \nmean that thousands of graphic unedited childbirth films can now be viewed  ` at the \npress of a few computer keys\u2018. In a fascinating study, Longhurst explores this \nphenomenon and its possible impact on the cultural imaginary.  \n \nIn `the Placental Body in 4D: Everyday Practices of Non-Diagnostic Sonography`. Julie \nPalmer examines the impact and significance of another medium, non-diagnostic four-\ndimensional ultrasound, a commercial practice in which still ultrasound scan images are \nanimated into cinematic style footage of foetal life in the womb\u2014soundtracks added to \nthese films are copied onto DVD\u2019s for expectant parent to take away.  Drawing on rich \nobservational data from  private scan studios Palmer examines in detail how the \nplacenta, the organ which is a point of connection and distinction between the pregnant \nwoman and the foetus, and which `often gets in the way of the best shot\u2019, is constituted \nin scanning practices. Bringing the insights of feminist philosophical work on the placenta \n(see Maher 2002) to bear on everyday clinical practices enables Palmer to explore how \nmaternal and foetal subjects are constituted in `real-time` through inter-subjective \nexchanges.Longhurst and Palmer\u2019s work raises a number of interesting questions. What \nwill it feel like to be able to watch films of yourself before and during childbirth? If \nmaternal origin is that which we must psychologically disavow, then is this new and often \ngraphic visibility of birth suggestive of a significant historical and\/or psycho-social shift? \nIt's not simply that representations of birth have increased and changed, but the fact that \nso many public kinds of representations of birth are now possible. In the context of a \nhistory in which birth was unrepresentable and unknowable, the possibility of visual \ncultures of birth is perhaps symptomatic of new forms of natal politics.  \n \nAlongside new popular and clinical visualisations of birth, some of the most \ninteresting feminist work on birth resides on the axis between creative practice and \ncritical thought. The work of the Manchester based art activist group birthrites is \nexemplary in this respect, with its concern with developing natal politics through \naesthetic collobrations between artists, midwives, childbirth activists, obstetrician and \nother senior medical professionals (see http:\/\/birthrites.org.uk\/).  Other indicative \nwork introduced in this issue is the art activism of groups such as the taking place \ncollective, the affective photograpy of  `urban explorers` whose work documents \nabandoned maternity wards (examined by Holly Prescott in this issue)  and the \npolticial perfomance art of Lena Simic and Kerstin Bueschges. In a short essay titled \n`The Taboo Aesthetics of the Birth Scene` I engage with US painter Jessica \nClements to explore the ways in which feminist art practice is challenging the taboo \non the representation of birth. Clements\u2019s oil paintings of the physical act of birth, are, \nI suggest, indicative of an anti-abject birth aesthetic-\u2013a political aesthetic in which the \nbirthing woman is resolutely the active subject not the abject-object of the birth-\nscene. In \u2018Louise Bourgeois, Ageing, and Maternal Bodies\u2019 Rosemary Betterton \nargues that Bourgeois\u2018 \u2018maternal aesthetics\u2018 offers resources for challenging the \ndeep cultural taboo on `aged maternity\u2018. At the age of 96, Bourgouis presented \nNature Study (2007), depicting `carnal couples and pregnant and birthing figures \nembodied in brilliant pinks and scarlet reds ...represent[ing] women as ...powerful \nagents of the maternal\u2018. \n \nThe rhetorical practice of \u2018coming out\u2019 has long been central to counter-political \ntheory. Lisa Baraitser\u2018s brilliantly evocative article, `Mothers who make things public\u2019 \ndemonstrates the continued importance of autobiography for feminist theoretical \nwork. Here Baraister elaborates together two concerns, maternal ethics, and the idea \nof `making things public`. Throughout she draws upon anecdotes to explore what it \nmeans to think mothering as an ethics, as a public and as a political practice.  The \nchallenge, as Baraitserr demonstrates, is to mobilize autobiographical interruptions in \nways that will transform the very terms of the debate. In other words, women need to \ncommunicate what they already know in ways that will make a difference. One of the \ncentral problems is that not all maternal subjects can be heard.  \n \nThe current noisy political and public debate which circulates around the maternal \nbody is fraught and contradictory. Young working class mothers are still routinely \ndemonised in political discourse and are stable television comic fodder; older \nmothers are censured and reviled for perverting `nature`; working mothers are \nroutinely castigated for failing their children; mothers who don\u2019t work outside the \nhome are rebuked for failing themselves, their families and the economy. Meanwhile, \nthe spectre of infertility has taken root within the imaginary life of white middle-class \ngirls and women and the 25% of women who now chose not to have children are \npitied and feared. The visual backdrop to these terrorising maternal figurations is an \nunending parade of images of beautiful, young, white, tight pregnant and post-partum \ncelebrity bodies. Indeed, the commodification and sexual objectification of the \nmaternal body, a subject matter deeply taboo as recently as the 1990s, is now \nroutine to the point of banality. In short, the maternal has never been so very public, \nso hyper-visible, but the wall of commentary which surrounds the maternal and the \nimages which represent it, are deeply incoherent. Within the cacaphony of maternal \npublicity, only certain kinds of maternal experience can be communicated and heard.  \nThe rise of confessional mommy columns in broadsheet newspapers, and the \nemergence of a `Mom lit\u2018 fiction genre, is evident of the ways in which middle class \nwomen, with educational and economic captial, dominate  mainstream literary and \njournalistic accounts of maternal experienence.  \n \nIrene Gedalof\u2019s article, ` Birth, Belonging and Migrant Mothers: Narratives of \nReproduction in Feminist Migration\u2019 highlights the ways in which maternal practices \nhave been devalued in theoretical writing about migrant communities. Gedalof\u2018s \narticle argues for a more interdisiplinary scholarship in which feminsist philosophical \nwriting on the maternal can be brought into dialogue with feminist migration studies to \nproduce more fluid accounts of `home\u2018 and `belonging\u2018. Lucy Hadfield\u2019s short essay, \n`Conviviality and Maternity: Anticipating Childbirth and Negotiating Intergenerational \nDifference`, explores similar questions of  the complex coming together of inter-\ngeneration, mothering  and migration in birth practices. Drawing on ethnographic \ndata, Hadfield\u2018s account of Lyn, a British Chinese mother-to-be `illustrates the \nintensity of the period of new motherhood in the lifecourse, as key beliefs and \nboundaries are re-negotiated`. In a different vein, performance artist Lena Simic\u2019s \n`On Medea\/Mothers\u2019 Clothes: A \u2018Foreigner\u2019 Re-figuring Medea and Motherhood\u2018 \nreturns us once more to themes of motherhood, migrancy and `home`. In this short \nreflective piece on her artistic practice, Simic juxtaposes Medea, the archetypal anti-\nmother, with her experiences and negotiations as a foreign mother in two working \nclass Liverpool toddler groups. This encounter ends with Simic `coming out` as an \nartist and culminates in her staging a production of Medea for the Liverpool mothers.  \nThere is something profoundly liminal (and intensely disciplinary) about \u2018the toddler \ngroup\u2019; Simic exposes some of the painful difficulties of negotiating this border space \nand in doing reveals something of what is at stake in thinking a feminist politics of \nnatality. \n \nDiscrimination in the workplace, inadequate childcare provision, the erosion of \nmaternal health care and reproductive rights, the deep structural relationship \nbetween poverty and maternity - these are just some of the pressing reasons for a \nfocus on the politics of birth. Whilst feminism has to continue to concern itself with \nthese inequalities, Arendt\u2019s work reminds us that we also need to think more \nsystematically about birth. What might it mean if natality, and not mortality, was \nactually the central category of political thought? Of course Arendt is not the first \nthinker to focus on the question of `life itself\u2019. The French philosopher Gilles Deleuze \nhas become a central figure in what might be described as a new \u2018philosophy of life\u2019, \na movement which has inspired contemporary thought with its emphasis on \nimmanence, creativity and ethics. However, as Michel Foucault argued, the \nemergence of \u2018biological\u2019 thinking in the modern period made `life\u2019 the central \ncategory of state governance (biopolitics). Today, a potent mixture of geneticisation, \nnew imperalism and neoliberalism has instrumentalised `life` further, making it the \ncentral node in global systems of capitalization, with the deepening inequalities which \naccompany globalism (Donna Haraway, 1997: 143 and see Franklin 2000). Arendt, \nwriting in the aftermath of the Second World War, developed her concept of natality \nas a political, humanist response to the terror, horror, alienation and banality of \ncontemporary life.  Arendt\u2019s challenge to us, to rethink life from the perspective of \nbirth, is undoubtedly as pressing as ever. While there is as yet no natalist \ncounterpoint to `death studies\u2018, this issue stakes a claim for birth as a vital site for \ncontemporary feminist thought and practice.   \nSpecial thanks to Lisa Baraitser, Louis Bennett, Caroline Gatrell and Irene Gedalof for their \nhelp with composing this introduction. \nReferences \nArendt, Hannah (1958) The Human Condition, Chicago: University of Chicago Press.  \n \nBattersby, C.
