Although\nmost investigated precarious rocks are surprisingly stable for ground motions similar to those\nexpected to have occurred during the AD 1356 Basle earthquake, at least two blocks are clearly\nprecariously balanced, with peak toppling accelerations lower than 0.3 g. Possible reasons why\nthese blocks did not topple during the AD 1356 Basle earthquake include incomplete separation\nfrom their base, sliding of precarious rocks, their size, lower than assumed ground accelerations\nand\/or duration of shaking.\nKey words: AD 1356 Basle earthquake, peak ground acceleration, precarious rocks, seismic\nhazard assessment.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nSeismologically, northern Switzerland (Fig. 1) is well known for\nthe AD 1356 Basle earthquake. It was the strongest historical earth-\nquake north of the Alps, which was felt in northern and central\nSwitzerland, eastern France, most parts of SW Germany and as\nfar as Paris and Prague (Mayer-Rosa & Cadiot 1979; Meyer et al.\n1994; Swiss Seismological Service, http:\/\/www.seismo.ethz.ch). In\nthe Basle region it caused devastation in the city and villages and\ndestruction of many strongholds (Fig. 1). Written documents and\narchaeological evidence allow an estimate of the earthquake inten-\nsities (MSK and EMS-98) in the epicentral area south of Basle of\nbetween VIII and IX\u2013X (Fig. 1).\nThe historical record indicates an elevated level of seismicity in\nnorthern Switzerland, which stimulated the palaeoseismological re-\nsearch in the Basle region (Becker et al. 2005) aimed at deciphering\nthe history of strong earthquakes in the region for the postglacial\nperiod. However, it was also intended to complete the archaeologi-\ncal and historical information about the AD 1356 Basle earthquake.\nThe palaeoseismological results could show that the Basle-Reinach\nFault south of Basle (Fig. 1) is the seismogenic fault for the AD 1356\nBasle earthquake (Ferry et al. 2005; Meghraoui et al. 2001). In addi-\ntion it was found that the Basle earthquake damaged speleothems in\ncaves (Lemeille et al. 1999), triggered numerous rock falls (Becker\n& Davenport 2003) and caused soft-sediment deformation in lake\ndeposits up to 60 km from the epicentre (Monecke et al. 2004).\nDuring field investigations of cliff sites for the rockfall study\n(Becker & Davenport 2003) some blocks could be seen in situ along\nthe edges of tall cliffs, which appeared to be instable with respect\nto high values of strong ground motion (Fig. 2). They might be\n\u2018precarious rocks\u2019 or \u2018semi-precarious rocks\u2019 that could be toppled\nby ground motions with peak accelerations between 0.1\u20130.3 g and\n0.3\u20130.5 g, respectively (Brune 1996, 1999). Surprisingly, all of these\n\u2018precarious rocks\u2019 are located only 4\u20136 km from the Basle-Reinach\nFault (Fig. 1), the seismogenic fault for the AD 1356 Basle earth-\nquake. This raises two questions which are addressed in this study:\n(1) what is the age of the blocks and\n(2) assuming that they were already in place at the time of the\nAD 1356 Basle earthquake, what are the toppling accelerations for\nthese blocks?\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS 689\n690 P.

The Basle-\nReinach Fault is shown by a jagged bold line, the main Eastern Border Fault\nof the Upper Rhine Graben by a simple jagged line. Macroseismic intensi-\nties (EMS-98) for cities (triangles) and castles (towers) are IX\u2013X (black),\nIX (grey) and VIII (white). Precarious rocks (circles) are distinguished as\nthose, which are largely stable (white), semi-precarious in cases (grey) and\nprecarious (black) with black lines indicating the section azimuths. Numbers\nalong the border of the map refer to Swiss geographical coordinates (km).\nThe following study is motivated by the potential use of such\nblocks as natural strong-motion seismoscopes, as described by\nBrune (1996, 1999), to provide constraints on estimates of ground\nmotion experienced during the AD 1356 Basle earthquake.\n2 G E O L O G I C A L S E T T I N G\nThe study area south of Basle, Switzerland is situated in the Tabular\nand Folded Jura Mountains close to the southeastern end of the\nUpper Rhine Graben (Fig. 1). The Mesozoic sedimentary rocks\nin the Folded Jura and in the Tabular Jura consist of claystones\nand marls with intercalated limestones, some as thick as 100 m\n(Bitterli-Brunner & Fischer 1988). These limestones crop out as\nnumerous cliff scarps (grey patches in Fig. 1). The most spectacular\ncliffs, reaching heights of up to 50 m, are those formed in the thick-\nbedded Upper Jurassic Rauracian limestones, which are underlain\nby Upper Jurassic Oxford marls. During several reconnaissance in-\nvestigations most Rauracian limestone cliff sites in the epicentral\narea of the AD 1356 Basle earthquake could be analysed (arrows in\nFig. 1) showing some spectacular precarious rocks (Fig. 2).\nThe Basle-Reinach Fault, the seismogenic fault for the AD 1356\nBasle earthquake, appears to be a normal fault in the trench sites\n(Ferry et al. 2005; Meghraoui et al. 2001), with a possible minor\nsinistral strike-slip component. In the landscape it is clearly rec-\nognizable as a straight fault scarp between the northern front of\nthe Folded Jura in the south and the outskirts of Basle in the north\n(Fig. 1). Tracing of the fault within the city of Basle was not yet pos-\nsible and the southern surface continuation within the Folded Jura\nFigure 2. Examples for precarious rocks in the Jura Mountains south of\nBasle: A Stu\u00a8ppen (T8), B Pelzmu\u00a8li (T14).\nis also unclear at the moment. Although the Basle-Reinach Fault\nshows traces of five major co-seismic ruptures during the post-\nglacial period with vertical displacements each between 0.5 and\n1 m (Ferry et al. 2005), it is not the main Eastern Border Fault of the\nUpper Rhine Graben. The Basle-Reinach Fault instead is separated\nfrom the Eastern Border Fault (Fig. 1) by flat ground made up of up\nto 900-m-thick Tertiary and Quaternary deposits, with the topmost\nmaximal 50 m consisting of gravels of the so-called \u2018Lower Terrace\u2019\n(Niederterrasse).\n3 O R I G I N A N D A G E O F\nP R E C A R I O U S LY B A L A N C E D RO C K S\nI N T H E B A S L E R E G I O N\nThe Basle earthquake occurred 650 yr ago. The precarious rocks\nseen in the Jura Mountains are precariously or semi-precariously\nbalanced rocks which can be used as natural \u2018low-resolution strong-\nmotion seismoscopes\u2019 (Brune 1996) for the AD 1356 Basle earth-\nquake only if they are older than 650 yr. Only in this case a shape and\na position similar to the present one can be assumed for the situation\n650 yr ago. Erosion, corrosion (dissolution) and, particularly, slope\ndegradation are important processes generating precarious rocks in\nthe Jura Mountains.\nFissures forming in the limestone behind the cliff faces that show\norientations parallel to the trend of neighbouring valleys, can be\nconsidered tension cracks due to topographic relief perpendicular\nto the valley trend, partly reactivating pre-existing joints. The two\nmost important cliff failure mechanisms, which have the potential to\ngenerate columns and slabs separated from the cliff face are toppling\n(Fig. 3a) and gliding (Fig. 3b). Toppling by outward movement of\nflat-lying Rauracian limestone slabs and columns is mainly caused\nby loss of lateral support and weakening of the underlying Oxford\nmarls due to weathering in the valley ground. Also wedging by\nroots and ice can be important. In contrast, gliding of whole lime-\nstone cliff sections on marl occurs only when bedding dip exceeds\nca. 10\u201315\u25e6 to overcome the residual shear strength of the underlying\nweathered Oxford marls. The rate of degradation is also controlled\nby the degree of erosion at the cliff\u2019s foot; high erosion rates at the\ncliff\u2019s foot increases the rate of cliff failure. This is particularly true\nfor the toppling case (Fig. 3a) which is a potentially stable situation\nwith generally low degradation rates. In contrast, Fig. 3(b) shows\na potentially instable configuration primarily controlled by bedding\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, GJI, 163, 689\u2013697\nStudies on \u2018precarious rocks\u2019 in Switzerland 691\nFigure 3. Two principle modes of cliff failure in the Upper Jurassic Rau-\nracien limestones of the Jura Mountains south of Basle: (a) \u2018toppling\u2019 in\nflat-lying, (b) \u2018gliding\u2019 in at least 10\u201315\u25e6 dipping beds.\ndip and less by the erosion rate at the cliff\u2019s foot. Thus, it looks\nthat the situation shown in Fig. 3(a) is more favourable for forma-\ntion and preservation of precarious rocks because of lower degra-\ndation rates and because of the increased influence of weathering\nprocesses on the precarious rock formation. Indeed, all investigated\nprecarious rocks were found in horizontal or flat-dipping Rauracian\nlimestones.\nCorrosion of limestone is particularly important in the intact rock\nmass before the mechanical separation of rock slabs and columns\nfrom the cliff face. The dissolution of limestone along fracture and\nbedding planes weakens the rock mass already long before slope\ndegradation processes commence. Theoretically, rain water in bare\nkarst (i.e. karst without soil at the surface) at 10\u25e6C and an annual\nprecipitation of 1000 l m\u22122 (approx. the annual average for the\nsouthern Tabular Jura) can solve 62 g m\u22122 limestone, that is, causes\n25 mm surface corrosion in 1000 yr, which is slightly higher than\nthe actually measured 14\u201320 mm in 1000 yr (Bo\u00a8gli 1980; Delalieux\net al. 2002; Stu\u00a8nzi 1994). The corrosion rate can be much higher in\ncovered karst with soil on top of the limestone as long as the water is\nin contact with the CO2-rich air in the soil. However, away from the\nearth surface the corrosion rate decreases significantly as soon as\n80 per cent of the carbonate solubility is reached. Thus, formation of\nprecarious rocks solely by dissolution of limestones would probably\nneed several 1000 or even 10 000 yr.\nErosion is only active at the cliff\u2019s surface and is mainly re-\nlated to frost weathering. Debris talus built-up by angular shards\nis widespread at various cliff sites, indicating the importance of\nfrost weathering. However, quantifying frost weathering is not yet\npossible for the Rauracian limestones, only a comparison with the\ncorrosion rate can be made in places. It appears that pure coral\nlimestone is less sensitive to frost weathering than marly limestone.\nThis is particularly true for marly limestone cropping out at cliff\nbases. Here, fracturing of the low-strength marly limestone due to\nhigh stresses at the cliff\u2019s foot and a slightly increased moisture con-\ntent in the marly limestones provide ideal conditions for an efficient\nfrost weathering. This process could generate notches at the cliff\u2019s\nfoot, so-called abris, which even may cause cliff collapse. These\nobservations also show that frost weathering in marly limestones\ncan reach a much higher erosion rate than the combined effects of\ncorrosion and frost weathering in pure coral limestones. In places\nwith slightly different lithologies the combined effects of corrosion\nand frost weathering may further weaken the pedestal of precarious\nrocks (cf. Fig. 2a).\nDirect age information for the precarious rocks is not yet avail-\nable. Neither has rock varnish formed on the rock surfaces (Bell et\nal. 1998), nor do favourable lichens grow on carbonatic rocks, which\ncould be used for dating purposes (Becker & Davenport 2003; Bull\n1996). Solely, the 36Cl-method seems to be promising based on\nfirst test measurements in Rauracian limestones (Ivy-Ochs, private\ncommunication, 2001); however, dates are not yet available for pre-\ncarious rocks. Thus, for the moment, the age of precarious rock\nformation in the Jura Mountains south of Basle can only be esti-\nmated based on analogue examples from the literature. One exam-\nple very close to the situation in the Jura Mountains is described by\nSchumm & Chorley (1964). The so-called Threatening Rock devel-\noped on 40-m-thick, flat-lying, wide-spaced jointed, thick-bedded\nsandstones on top of shales. It was separated by a fissure paral-\nlel to the cliff face and toppled by undermining of the cliff foot.\nThe progressive opening of the fissure was monitored starting 5 yr\nbefore failure of Threatening Rock. This database led Schumm &\nChorley (1964) to conclude that separation of Threatening Rock\nfrom the cliff face probably started about 2500 yr before its failure.\nOf course, a prediction based on such a short observation interval is\nhighly debatable, as can be shown for the opposite case, that is, fore-\ncasting of slope failures based on short-term observations (Zvelebil\n& Moser 2001). However, we think the date given by Schumm &\nChorley (1964) is a lower age limit for the precarious rocks seen\nin flat-lying, thick-bedded Rauracian limestones in the Basle re-\ngion. Based on the weathering profiles of some precarious rocks\n(cf. Fig. 2a) and the thick debris deposits at many cliff foots\n(Fig. 3a), which protect the cliff foot against erosion and support the\nrock cliff laterally, we think that the investigated precarious rocks are\nat least a few thousand years old and thus represent natural strong-\nmotion seismoscopes for the AD 1356 Basle earthquake.\n4 P R E C A R I O U S RO C K M E T H O D O L O G Y\n4.1 Field reconnaissance and measurements\nIn a field survey during the winter season several of the major\ncliff sites were investigated in the Jura Mountains south of Basle\n(Fig. 1).

(1996) it is assumed (1) that the rigid block resting on a pedestal\nis free to rotate about either of the two supporting points O1 and\nO2(Fig. 5) and (2) that no sliding occurs during the rocking motion\nbetween the block and the base. R1 and R2 measure the distances\nbetween the rocking points O1 and O2, respectively, and the centre\nof mass, \u03b11 and \u03b12 are the angles between R1 and R2, respectively,\nand the vertical, \u03b4 is the dip of the seating in the sectional plan.

The geometrical parameters\nare shown in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 1 with the azimuths of\nthe sectional planes given in the last column.\nDuring earthquakes the horizontal components of ground motion\nplay a dominant role in toppling of rocking blocks. For the de-\ntermination of the horizontal peak toppling acceleration necessary\nto overturn a precariously balanced rock, the FORTRAN program\nROCKING V.1.0 (von Seggern 2001) of the Nevada Seismological\nLaboratory was used. This program is based on the equation of mo-\ntion of a rocking rigid block about supporting points O1 and O2 due\nto the accelerating motion of the foundation (Shi et al. 1996). No\nanalytical solution exists except for simple block geometries and\nsmall angles. Thus, the equation is integrated numerically using\na Runge-Kutta algorithm for given input values for the horizontal\n(a\u00afx or a\u00afy) and vertical ground acceleration (a\u00afz) (von Seggern 2001).\nTable 2.

(1996), Anooshehpoor & Brune (2002) and\nAnooshehpoor et al. (2004).\nInput data are: (1) geometrical parameters (Fig. 5) for the most\nfavourable toppling sections, which are defined by the smallest an-\ngles \u03b11 or \u03b12 and the largest value for \u03b4 for a given geometry. These\nsections are shown in grey in Fig. 4 for the investigated blocks.\nIn cases where the most favourable toppling direction was unclear,\ntwo sections were defined for calculations of blocks T1, T4 and T8\n(Fig. 4). (2) Acceleration data were taken from the European\nStrong Motion Database (Ambraseys et al. 2001) using seismo-\ngrams from stations on hard rock, which are as close as possible\nto the seismogenic fault and\/or epicentre. Preferentially accelero-\ngrams were selected from shallow normal-faulting earthquakes with\nmagnitudes Ms 6\u20137 (Table 2), that is, data close to the expected\nAD 1356 Basle earthquake based on macroseismical, archaeological\nand palaeoseismological evidence (Fa\u00a8h et al. 2003; Ferry et al. 2005;\nMayer-Rosa & Cadiot 1979).\n4.3 Results\nTable 3 lists the toppling accelerations for the most susceptible\nrock sections (Fig. 4, Table 1) for the different earthquake signals\nrecorded at the stations listed in Table 2. The lowest toppling accel-\nerations in Table 3 are shown in bold; asterisks mark the cases where\nno toppling at all occurred. Table 3 shows that some blocks are very\nstable with hardly any toppling for the applied signals, or if at all,\nthen only for large peak ground accelerations >1 g. In these cases,\nsliding is much more likely than toppling failure. An ideal precari-\nously balanced rock should be slim and tall, which is obviously not\nthe case for the block Tu\u00a8fleten T1-1\/2 (Fig. 4) and also Pelzmu\u00a8li\nT16 seems to be well founded on its broad seating. For Stu\u00a8ppen T8\n(Table 1, Fig. 2a) two sections were analysed, although it should be\nclear in advance that section Stu\u00a8ppen T8-1 is the less stable one.\nBoth sections are relatively stable against toppling and only for a\nfew signals toppling would have occurred close to accelerations\naround 0.5 g. This example shows that if the distance between the\ncentre of mass and the pedestal is small, that is, the angles \u03b11 and \u03b12\nare large, the block is very stable against toppling. Falkenflue T12\ncomes close to an ideal slim and tall precariously balanced rock with\na small seating. This block topples for all applied seismic signals\nfrequently toppling accelerations as low as 200 to 500 cm s\u22122. Also\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, GJI, 163, 689\u2013697\n694 P. Schu\u00a8rch and A. Becker\nTable 3. Results for the toppling acceleration for the different seismic input signals and the investigated precarious rock geometries. Marked in grey are those\nresults where scaling factors >2 are applied to the signals. The boundaries for a\u00af in the lower section refer approximately to what Brune (1996) defined as\nsemi-precariously (300\u2013500 cm s\u22122) and precariously balanced rocks (100\u2013299 cm s\u22122).\nPelzmu\u00a8li T14 (Figs 2b and 4) is very instable with the lowest toppling\nacceleration at 150 cm s\u22122. The high toppling acceleration values\nfor the signals 593 and 763 may indicate that these earthquakes are\ntoo weak or shaking did not last long enough to cause toppling even\nof the most susceptible blocks. Whether a precarious rock topples\ndepends strongly on the frequency spectrum of the seismic signal\nas well as the duration of shaking and not only on the earthquake\nstrength. Fig. 6 illustrates the results given in Table 3 by drawing the\nprobability of toppling versus toppling acceleration for the different\nearthquake signals and the different block sections. It illustrates that\nTu\u00a8fleten T1-1\/2 are very stable showing only five toppling events\n(of 23) for accelerations >1 g. In contrast, toppling accelerations for\nFalkenflue T12 and Pelzmu\u00a8li T14 are concentrated below 1g with\na high probability of occurrence as low as 0.2 g. Stability of other\nblocks is between these extreme cases and the blocks potentially fail\nfor horizontal accelerations between 0.5 to 1.0 g for certain ground\nmotions.\n5 D I S C U S S I O N\nReconnaissance of several cliff sites (Fig. 1) in the epicentral area\nof the AD 1356 Basle earthquake supplied 17 \u2018precarious rocks\u2019,\nof which seven were regarded as possibly instable during strong\nground motion. From these only two (T12 and T14) are precariously\nand two (or three) further blocks are possibly semi-precariously\nbalanced rocks following the definition by Brune (1996, 1999). We\nare aware of the small database and, thus, do not want to over-\ninterpret our observations. Here, we only discuss the question why\nat all precariously balanced rocks can be found in the epicentral area\nof the Basle earthquake only 4\u20136 km from the Basle-Reinach Fault.\nOne reason why the blocks are still standing could be that they are\nnot fully separated from their base, they are still\u2014at least partly\u2014\n\u2018welded\u2019 to their pedestals. This assumption may be true for blocks\nT8 (Fig. 2a) and possibly for T4 and T12, but most unlikely for\nT14 (Fig. 2b). For values \u03b1 > 25\u25e6 and dips \u03b4 \u2265 10\u25e6 sliding of the\nrocks during strong shaking may occur, which dampens rocking\nmotions and could prevent blocks from toppling (Anooshehpoor\net al. 2004). This is a possible reason why T14 did not topple;\nhowever, sliding occurs only on a very smooth surface which is\ngenerally not the case for rock surfaces in a natural environment.\nAlso the size of the precarious rock may have an influence on the\ntoppling behaviour, particularly in the epicentral region, because\nlarger blocks are more sensitive to the low-frequency components\nof ground motion compared to smaller blocks (Anooshehpoor et al.\n2004).\nTopography effects on the behaviour of precarious rocks during\nstrong ground motions are ambivalent and by far not understood\n(Anderson & Brune 1999). On one hand, precarious rocks are on\nthe top or at margins of cliffs, which could cause amplification\n(Geli et al. 1988). On the other hand, bedrock tends to cause smaller\namplifications (Anderson & Brune 1999). Combined, the two effects\nmay cancel each other resulting in an average behaviour. However,\nif the combined effect is higher than the average, that is, topography\namplifies ground motion, the Basle earthquake should have been\nweaker although the effect on the investigate sites with precarious\nrocks was stronger.\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, GJI, 163, 689\u2013697\nStudies on \u2018precarious rocks\u2019 in Switzerland 695\n1000 2000 3000 4000\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nPr\nob\nab\nilit\ny \nof\n to\npp\nlin\ng\nT\u00fcfleten T1-1\n1000 2000 3000 4000\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nPr\nob\nab\nilit\ny \nof\n to\npp\nlin\ng\nT\u00fcfleten T1-2\n1000 2000 3000 4000\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nFulnau T4-1\n1000 2000 3000 4000\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nFulnau T4-2\n1000 2000 3000 4000\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nSt\u00fcppen T8-1\n1000 2000 3000 4000\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nSt\u00fcppen T8-2\n1000 2000 3000 4000\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nFalkenflue T12\n1000 2000 3000 4000\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nSt. Annafeld T13\n1000 2000 3000 4000\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nPelzm\u00fcli T14\n1000 2000 3000 4000\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nPelzm\u00fcli T16\nPr\nob\nab\nilit\ny \nof\n to\npp\nlin\ng\nPr\nob\nab\nilit\ny \nof\n to\npp\nlin\ng\nPr\nob\nab\nilit\ny \nof\n to\npp\nlin\ng\nPr\nob\nab\nilit\ny \nof\n to\npp\nlin\ng\nPr\nob\nab\nilit\ny \nof\n to\npp\nlin\ng\nPr\nob\nab\nilit\ny \nof\n to\npp\nlin\ng\nPr\nob\nab\nilit\ny \nof\n to\npp\nlin\ng\nPr\nob\nab\nilit\ny \nof\n to\npp\nlin\ng\nToppling acceleration (cm s\u22122)\nToppling acceleration (cm s\u22122)\nToppling acceleration (cm s\u22122)\nToppling acceleration (cm s\u22122)\nToppling acceleration (cm s\u22122) Toppling acceleration (cm s\u22122)\nToppling acceleration (cm s\u22122)\nToppling acceleration (cm s\u22122)\nToppling acceleration (cm s\u22122)\nToppling acceleration (cm s\u22122)\n     \nFigure 6. Diagrams showing the probability of toppling versus toppling acceleration for the different precarious rock sections (T1-1 to T16) for 23 applied\nseismic input signals as shown in Table 2.\nBrune & Whitney (2000) concluded that earthquakes with in-\ntensities VII MM would probably have toppled most near-source\nprecarious rocks, those with VIII MM would have toppled all. If\nit is assumed that toppling acceleration refers to the approximate\npeak ground acceleration (Brune & Whitney 2000), the toppling\naccelerations for the precarious rocks in the Basle region could be\ncompared with peak ground accelerations expected for the AD 1356\nBasle earthquake. With intensities VIII to IX\u2013X MSK and a magni-\ntude M w 6.5 (Ferry et al. 2005) for the AD 1356 Basle earthquake,\nmaximum horizontal peak ground acceleration could be as low as\n360\u2013460 cm s\u22122 at the investigation sites about 4\u20136 km from the\nseismogenic fault (Ambraseys et al. 1996). Lacave et al. (2004)\nestimated the peak ground acceleration for the Basle earthquake\nin a near-surface cave 5 km from the seismogenic fault with\n1030 cm s\u22122 to explain the complete breaking of a group of sta-\nlactites. Although this value is still within the 1\u03c3 standard deviation\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, GJI, 163, 689\u2013697\n696 P. Schu\u00a8rch and A. Becker\nrange of Ambraseys et al. (1996) attenuation equations this peak\nground acceleration should have caused toppling of almost all pre-\ncarious rocks investigated in this study (Fig. 6) and, certainly, for the\nprecarious rocks T12 and T14. Considering only those signals that\nhave been scaled-up by a factor of less than 2 (Table 3), toppling\nof the investigated precarious blocks should have occurred for peak\nground accelerations between 200 and 600 cm s\u22122. This range of\nmaximum past peak ground accelerations would be compatible with\na maximum magnitude M w for the Basle earthquake in the range\nbetween ca. 5 and 7. However, signals used for calculation of top-\npling acceleration giving magnitude estimates M w < 6.0 seem not\nto be compatible with the AD 1356 Basle earthquake palaeoseismic\nevidence from trench sites (Ferry et al. 2005), rockfalls (Becker &\nDavenport 2003) and damage of speleothems (Lemeille et al. 1999).\nBrune (1996, 1999) concluded precariously balanced rocks do\nnot exist in the close vicinity of seismically active faults like the\nSan Andreas Fault. In the Mojave section of the San Andreas Fault\nno precarious rock was found within 14 km. Recently Brune (2003)\ndescribed just such occurrences as close as 2\u20137 km from active faults\nwith known historical earthquakes. These observations could be\nassociated with low ground accelerations in the footwall of normal\nfaults (Brune & Anooshehpoor 1999; Oglesby et al. 1998) and step-\nover regions along transtensional strike-slip faults (Brune 2003).\nLow ground accelerations from the Basle-Reinach fault embedded\nin an extending region of the southernmost Upper Rhine Graben\nwith thick deposits of soft sediments in the surroundings may also\nexplain that some of the precarious rocks in the close distance did not\ntopple during the AD 1356 Basle earthquake. However, currently the\ndatabase is too small to further elaborate such a model for the Basle\nregion. As has been shown recently by near-source strong-motion\ndata from the Chichi, Izmit and Denali earthquakes peak ground\naccelerations can be spatially highly variable and much lower than\nexpected from published attenuation curves (Anooshehpoor et al.\n2004) even in cases without any particular geological boundary\nconditions.\nThis study is the first attempt to apply the precarious rock method-\nology in the epicentral area of the AD 1356 Basle earthquake, an\narea with known high seismic energy release in Switzerland. Al-\nthough several aspects deserve further investigations, such as effect\nof precarious rock size, possible sliding of precarious rocks, non-\nideal contact surfaces between precarious rock and pedestal, and\nduration of input motion (Anooshehpoor et al. 2004), the method\nhas the potential to directly indicate past ground shaking. This in-\nformation can be used to complete the palaeoseismic information\nabout pre-historical earthquakes and historical shocks, which are\nonly weakly documented. The method can supply a significant con-\ntribution for the seismic hazard assessment in the Basle region where\nnumerous cliff sites (Fig. 1) are still awaiting further investigations.\nA C K N O W L E D G M E N T S\nThe project was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation\n(SNF) and the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zu\u00a8rich in the\nframe of the former PALEOSEIS Project at the Geophysical Insti-\ntute, Professor Dr D.
