We employ Wenger's\n(1998) concept of communities of practice to give emphasis to social identification as a\ncentral aspect of learning, which should crucially influence our thinking about the design\nof learning environments. We describe learning relationships in terms of form (one-\nto-one, one-to-many etc.), nature (explorative, formative and comparative), distance\n(first-, second-order), and context, and we describe a first attempt at an empirical\napproach to their identification and measurement.\nIntroduction\nOver the last five years we have seen a very significant increase in the use of Information\nCommunication Technologies (ICT) in schools, colleges and university. For example in\n1998, there were over 195 accredited US universities offering a thousand or more distance\nlearning courses (Philips and Yager, 1998). By no means were all of these new courses\nassociated with educational innovation. The speed and ease of implementation of Web-\nbased approaches, in particular, is resulting in design by imitation of current courses and\nmethods, with a real lack of innovation or utilization of the power inherent in technology-\nbased learning. Although matters are improving (see for example Brown, 1999), part of the\nreason for this failure to innovate is, we argue, because of the large gap between theory and\npractice.\nThis paper sets out to bridge what might be regarded as the psychological and\nanthropological views of situated learning by focusing on the concept of learning\nrelationships. The aim is to consider how, in designing learning environments and tasks, we\n6\nAJt-J Volume 7 Number 3\nmight usefully shift our focus away from the design of activities and examine more\ncarefully what it is that motivates learners to engage in the learning task in the first place.\nWhat is it that would encourage them to strive for mastery? We ask what it is that the\nindividual learner characteristically brings to the activity and to the environment, beyond\nthe rather unproven variables of learning style. Finally we consider, with an example from\na current project, how the concept of learning relationships might be elaborated\nempirically and used in the design of learning technology.\nThe theoretical underpinning of attempts to design learning environments has recently\nwitnessed two distinct shifts of emphasis. First, there has been a shift from a\nrepresentational view of learning in which an acquisition metaphor guided design (e.g.\nAnderson, Boyle, Farrell and Reiser, 1990), to a constructivist view in which learning is\nprimarily developed through activity (Papert, 1990). Brown, Collins and Duguid (1989)\nargued that we should consider concepts as tools, to be understood through use, rather\nthan as self-contained entities to be delivered through instruction. A second shift, however,\nhas. been away from a focus on the individual, towards a new emphasis on social contexts\nfor learning (Glaser, 1990). There are at least two aspects to this. First, we have seen for\nabout fifteen years a new emphasis on learning through collaboration and co-operation\n(see Kaye, 1992), but, even more importantly perhaps, came the notion of situated learning\n(Lave, 1988; Lave and Wenger, 1991; Suchman 1987).\nAs Barab and Duffy (1999) point out, there are at least two 'flavours' to situated learning.\nOne, following Resnick's (1987) articulation of the nature of informal, out-of-school\nlearning, and Cole and Scribner's (1974) approach to the cognitive implications of formal\nand informal learning, can be regarded as a socio-psychological view of situativity. They\nemphasized the importance of context-dependent learning in informal settings. Children in\ntraditional societies learn by observing others, a form of apprenticeship where the\nknowledge often remains tacit. In contrast, formal education removes the child from\ncontext by locating learning in schools. The separation of where you learn from what you\nlearn can be seen as playing an important part in developing abstract thinking in the child,\nbut a growing dissatisfaction with formal schooling has led to a 'participation' metaphor\nreplacing the 'acquisition' metaphor (Sfard, 1998). See Laurillard (1993) for a discussion of\nthe 'abstraction' issue in the context of university education.\nThis activity-based view of situated learning led to the design of what Barab and Duffy\n(following Senge, 1994) call 'practice fields'. These represent constructivist tasks in which\nevery effort is made to make the learning activity authentic to the social context in which\nthe skills or knowledge are normally embedded. Examples of approaches to the design of\npractice fields are problem-based learning (Savery and Duffy, 1996), anchored instruction\n(CTGV, 1993) and cognitive apprenticeship (Collins et al, 1989). Here, the main design\nemphasis is on the relationship between the nature of the learning task in educational or\ntraining environments, and its characteristics when situated in real use. This connection\nbetween the classroom and the real world through 'practice fields' has certain cognitive\nimplications. It is unclear, for example, how children abstract out general principles and\navoid becoming 'context-bound' (cf. Cole and Scribner, 1974).\nThe second view of situativity, however, is a social anthropological one in which the\ninfluence of a wider social context is emphasized (Lave and Wenger, 1991 ). Here we find\nCJ. H. Fowler and}. T. Mayes Learning relationships from theory to design\nthe concept of a community of practice introduced. With it comes an emphasis on the\npractitioner's relationship with a wider but identifiable group of people rather than the\nrelationship of the activity itself to the wider practice, even though it is the practice itself\nthat identifies the community. This provides a different perspective on what is 'situated'.\nFor Lave (1997) and Wenger (1998) it is not just the meaning to be attached to an activity\nthat is derived from a community of practice, but a much more fundamental aspect. The\nindividual's identity is shaped by the relationship. Lave and Wenger's perspective, however,\nemphasizes the stable and long-term nature of communities of practice. In our view this\nrestricts the potential usefulness of the idea for the design of learning environments, where\nshort-term and more fragile groups may nevertheless exert a powerful influence on the\nmotivation to learn. Indeed, the social psychological literature on social identification\n(Turner, 1991; Hogg and Adams, 1988) seems to demonstrate that temporary but real\nsocial identities can be created through group membership.\nThe starting point for this paper is a description of two conceptual frameworks. Wenger\n(1998) describes how communities of practice underpin learning in both formal and\ninformal contexts. Mayes and Fowler (1999) map a cognitive-constructivist account of\nlearning onto the design of learning environments.\nWenger's conceptualization\nFor Wenger, knowledge is a matter of competence in a valued enterprise. The value is given\nby social participation - in particular, by being an active participant in the practices of\nsocial communities, and by constructing an identity in relation to each community.\nParticipating in a community - it may be a project team, say, or a member of a professional\ngroup - is both a kind of action and a form of belonging. Wenger's social theory of\nlearning, therefore, recognizes both strands of situativity described above: meaning is given\nboth to the situated activities themselves and to the process of social identification which\ndrives the learners'activity.\nWenger argues that the social production of meaning is the relevant unit of analysis for\npractice. Meaning is continually negotiated through the processes of participation and\nreification. It is worth quoting Wenger directly on participation:\nParticipation is an active process, but I will reserve the term for actors who are members\nof social communities. For instance, I will not say that a computer 'participates' in a\ncommunity of practice, even though it may be part of that process and play an active\nrole in getting things done . . . In this regard what I take to characterise participation is\nthe possibility of mutual recognition . . . What we recognise has to do with our mutual\nability to negotiate meaning... The relations between parents and children, or between\nworkers and supervisor, are mutual in the sense that participants shape each others'\nexperiences of meaning.\nFor Wenger, participation is not the same thing as collaboration\/It goes beyond direct\nengagement in specific activities, and is 'not something we turn on and off'. Wenger argues\nthat our engagement with tasks is social, even where it does not directly involve any kind of\nexplicit dialogue.\nAlt-J Volume 7 Number 3\nBeing in a hotel room by yourself preparing a set of slides for a presentation the next\nmorning may not seem like a particularly social event, yet its meaning is fundamentally\nsocial. Not only is the audience with you as you attempt to make your points\nunderstandable, but your colleagues are there too, looking over your shoulder, as it were,\nrepresenting for you your sense of accountability to the professional standards of your\ncommunity.\nWe can participate in global communities of practice, but more generally we tend to engage\nwith local ones. How can we identify that a community of practice has formed? Wenger\nsuggests that we must look for sustained mutual relationships, which will tend to involve\nshared ways of engaging in doing things together, and the rapid flow of information. The\ndiscourse in such a community will have the appearance of an ongoing process, with many\nshared assumptions and an absence of introductory preambles. There will be jargon, inside\njokes, many communication shortcuts, and the rapid setup of a problem to be discussed.\nFor Wenger, there are three stages of coming to belong to a community of practice:\n\u2022 imagination: through orientation and exploration, we identify with a community of\npractice;\n\u2022 engagement: through participating in a community we value, we come to belong to that\ncommunity;\n\u2022 alignment: we connect to a new framework of convergence.\nWenger articulates the same basic point that this paper is arguing, namely that issues of\neducation should be addressed first and foremost in terms of identities and modes of\nbelonging, and only secondarily in terms of skills and information. This view encourages\nus to consider educational designs not just in terms of techniques for supporting the\nconstruction of knowledge (let alone in terms of delivery of a curriculum), but more\ngenerally in terms of their effects on the formation of identities. What does this mean for\ndesign? Wenger goes some way towards operationalizing his framework (although not very\nfar) by proposing that students need:\n\u2022 places of engagement;\n\u2022 materials and experiences with which to build an identity;\n\u2022 ways of making their actions matter.\nThe constructivist approach requires the design of tasks which are personally meaningful\nfor learners. Wenger's conceptualization of communities of practice gives us a way of\ndefining personal meaning in a way that is not just circular. However, it is not a description\nof learning per se, or of how people learn together. It provides a very high-level design\nheuristic and in that sense it tells us where we should start looking for design principles\nparticularly within an organizational context.\nA framework for the design of learning technology\nWhen BT became interested in designing and building online educational services, it soon\nbecame apparent that it was hard to move from theoretical concepts, e.g. constructivism or\nconceptualization, to a set of design principles or guidelines that could help engineer the\nnext generation of educational technology. We needed conceptual frameworks that bridged\nC.\\. H. Fowler and J.T. Mayes Learning relationships from theory to design\nthe theory and design. Mayes (1995) offered such a framework. This framework described\nthree broad modes of learning and then mapped these onto appropriate design principles.\nThe modes or stages of learning were:\n\u2022 Conceptualization: the coming into contact with other people's concepts.\n\u2022 Construction: the building and testing of one's knowledge through the performance of\nmeaningful tasks.\n\u2022 Dialogue: the debate and discussion that results in the creation of new concepts.\nIt is important to note that 'conceptualization' is about other people's concepts, 'construc-\ntion' is about building knowledge from combining your own and other people's concepts\ninto something meaningful. 'Dialogue' refers back to the creation of hew concepts (rather\nthan knowledge) that then triggers another cycle of the reconceptualization process.\nFowler and Mayes (1997) have extended the notion of dialogue to include dialogues or\nlearning conversations for clarification and confirmation at the conceptualization stage,\nand dialogue for co-operation and collaboration at the construction stage. The framework\nproposes that each learning stage should be associated with a different kind of pedagogy,\nwhich in turn implies a different kind of learning environment and a different form of\ncourseware. At conceptualization, the learner tends to rely on traditional forms of\ncourseware which explain and illuminate the concepts in the subject matter, typically\nbuilding an exposition through textbooks, multimedia or simulations. This type of\ncourseware was referred to as primary. Secondary courseware took the form of materials or\ntools that supported 'learning by doing', while tertiary courseware referred to the captured\ndialogues which gave rise to significant learning episodes and the availability of this\nmaterial to others in the support of vicarious learning (McKendree, Stenning, Mayes, Lee,\nand Cox, 1998).\nThe framework can be developed, by elaborating the role of dialogue. We have previously\nemphasized the importance of dialogue in learning, elevating it above, or at least level with,\nconceptualization as a pedagogical design principle. Dialogue provides the vehicle for\nconceptual movement. It facilitates the transition between the stages and the advance from\none reconceptualization cycle to the next.2 To emphasize the central role of dialogue even\nfurther we now view it not as a separate stage, but as integral to the whole cycle. The third\nstage we have now labelled 'identification. At the identification stage, the learner has\nreached a sufficient level of understanding to be able to relate to other conceptualizations\nand thus begin the process again. By calling this process identification it is intended to\nemphasize our belief that it is social in origin, and can only be understood in terms of the\nlearner's relationships with others. It makes the important design point that this stage\ncannot be fully understood by knowing all about the interactions between the subject\nmatter, the tasks, or the pedagogical environment. The nature of the interactions between\nindividual learners and other people now comes fully into focus.\nLearning relationships: a new conceptualization\nWenger's account paints a rich picture of the social process of belonging and provides an\nexplanation of personal motivation through identification with the practices of com-\nmunities. People are not motivated to learn per se, but are motivated to join a community\n10\nAlt-} Volume 7 Number 3\nof practice - an end that can be best achieved through learning. It is this richer social\ncontext and explanation of motivation that are lacking in our previous framework.\nThe two frameworks impact on design in different ways. For Wenger the main implication\nof his analysis is for organizations. For the present authors, the design goals are\npedagogical. The combination of pedagogical and organizational design principles offers\nthe potential of innovative and potentially powerful applications.\nWenger's account of the stages of coming to belong to a community of practice parallels\nthe stages of learning in our own account. His imagination stage, where the individual\nbegins to identify the boundaries of a community of practice, involves a process of\nconceptualization. Equally engagement and construction are both about 'doing and\ndiscovering', and alignment and identification are stages which adjust understanding to a\nwider context.\nA learning relationship exists when we learn from, or through, others. Such relationships\nwill vary according to the characteristics of the groups involved, the context within which\nthey operate, and the strength of the relationships. These relationships may be one of three\ndifferent forms: one-to-one (e.g. parent to child); one-to-many (e.g. teacher to learners);\nand many-to-many (e.g. learning in peer groups or networks). The strength and effective-\nness of the learning will also vary within the different kinds of relationships. These types of\nrelationship vary according to the nature of the learning experience and are referred to as\nexplorative, formative and comparative learning relationships, and they are described in\nmore detail below.\nAn explorative learning relationship is about discovery. In our previous account it involves\nthe discovery of other peoples' concepts, and for Wenger, the discovery of the practice\nboundaries. This relationship is often very descriptive (discovering the 'what' more than the\n'why'), although some level of explanation will be involved, and asymmetrical in that most\nof the information flow is one way (from the 'outside in'). A formative learning relationship\nfocuses more on the building of understanding through guided activity, and this is\nachieved through a constructive approach - the building and testing of hypotheses about\nthe world, and about the nature of practice. This relationship is likely to be balanced or\nsymmetrical, with outputs from the learner matched by feedback on performance. The\nthird kind of learning relationship, comparative, characterizes a relationship that occurs\nonce a level of expertize has been achieved or when an individual becomes accepted as\nmore than a peripheral member of a community of practice. It is a relationship that allows\nthe learner to identify their state of knowledge with others, or to align their practice with\nthat of a community or organization. The primary purpose of a comparative relationship\nis not necessarily to acquire new knowledge, but to position and adjust existing knowledge\nby comparison with other knowledge states. The asymmetry is therefore in the opposite\ndirection to the explorative stage (i.e. 'inside out'), and is less about acquisition and more\nabout tuning and maintenance of the knowledge or practice. Such relationships may take\non a defensive nature that can account for both the emotional charge of some of the\ndialogue that takes place and the resistance to change of some communities of practice.\nSocial network theory provides us with a method for describing and modelling learning\nrelationships within given boundaries. The nodes in such a network represent the learners,\nand the links between them indicate that a relationship exists. Further, the concept of\n_\nC.J. H. Fowler andJ.T. Mayes Learning relationships from theory to design\nlearning relationships recognizes that such relationships in themselves exist within a wider\nnetwork. A relationship can be defined in terms of the distance between the two nodes.\nLearning relationships (regardless of type) are all first-order relationships. Clearly, second-\norder and other more distant relationships will influence these relationships and their\nrequirements. For example, the relationship between a student and a teacher is, in terms of\nlearning, a first-order relationship. However, that relationship will be influenced by the\nteacher's relationship with the year co-ordinator (second-order), and the year co-\nordinator's relationship with the headteacher (third-order) and so on. It is assumed that the\neffective boundary of a learning relationship does not exceed a third-order relationship,\nalthough a community of practice could extend beyond that (see Figure 1). The\ncommunity formed by a bounded learning relationship can be regarded as a micro-\ncommunity of learners, within a community of practice. As well as determining the\nboundaries of the micro-community, another reason for measuring the different orders of\nrelationship is that it may help to identify ways of supporting a first-order relationship.\nThe basic rationale for a social network analysis is to focus attention on the relationships\nthat exist, and to identify those that do not.\nBoundary of the micro-\ncommunity of learners\nExplorative,\nFormative\nor Comparative\nFigure I. A typical representation of a learning relationship\nThese characteristics of the learning relationship are summarized below:\n\u2022 Forms: one-to-one; one-to-many; many-to-many;\n\u2022 Types: explorative, formative, comparative;\n\u2022 Distance: first-order; second-order; third-order;\n\u2022 Context: social groups; socio-political climate; wider community of practice.\nThe nodes within a learning relationship or the wider learning network are referred to as\nagents. The learner in the relationship is called a 'learning agent', and the facilitator is\ncalled a 'support agent'. It is important to distinguish between the different functions\n12\nA\/t-J Volume 7 Number 3\nprovided by the learning agent. Any agent must be a knowledge resource, able to sustain a\ndialogue with the learner, and able to guide and support the learning tasks. These are the\ncharacteristics which have previously been used to specify the requirements for an\nintelligent tutoring system (Wenger, 1987). Any agent must be able potentially to satisfy\nthese criteria, although in any particular learning relationship these conditions may not be\nmet. A crucial issue to address is the extent to which the characteristics of an agent in a\nlearning relationship can be provided through technology. This is a fundamental question\nabout the role of learning technology, under which most of the design issues for computer-\nbased learning environments can be subsumed. What aspects of effective learning support\nabsolutely require a human relationship?\nWhat next?\nOur next steps are to operationalize the concept and to collect empirical evidence to test,\nrefine or refute it. We intend to explore the learning relationships of sixteen-year-olds\nattending schools in three different European countries (UK, Finland and Portugal). By\nusing countries from the north, middle and south of Europe we are also hoping to identify\nany key cultural variables that may influence the nature and form of the learning\nrelationships.\nLearning relationships will be identified using a questionnaire, and represented visually in\na learning network using a proprietary drawing tool. The drawing tool also supports\nannotations of the relationships with both specific data (e.g. descriptions of the learners)\nout to more general data (e.g. descriptions of the schools and cultures). Once the main\nsupport agent of the learner has been identified, then the relationship between the learner\nand support agent (e.g. teacher, parent or friend) can be classified. The two agents\nundertake a task and their learning behaviours are classified as one of the three learning\ntypes through the use of a checklist. The relationship type is then noted on the learning\nrelationship diagram. Data are also being collected about the individual learner, their\nfamilies, school and wider communities.\nOnce all the data have been collected these will be analysed using a multi-level modelling\ntechnique (Goldstein, 1995). This technique allows one to assess the different factors\naffecting the relationships. For example, strong learning relationships may only be found\nfor learners from certain types of families or who attend schools with a particular learning\nethos.\nIf learning relationships prove to be a powerful factor in learning, then the concept will be\nused to rethink how we define online educational services. Future services that are sensitive\nto learning relationships may look for ways to optimize configurations so that key agents\nare connected and their relationship is maximized to enhance learning. It is planned to\nbuild and test such a prototype service for home-school communities in the UK, Finland\nand Portugal.\nThe emphasis of this empirical work is to explore whether or not learning relationships can\nprovide us with a sufficiently robust analytical model for determining requirements for, and\nevaluation of, learning networks. Where such networks exist, the concept can help us\nidentify relationships that should be formed, optimized or even terminated. An IP-based\nservice based on learning relationships may be just what is required to move us away from\n13\nC.J. H. Fowler andJJ. Mayes Learning relationships from theory to design\nthe overemphasis on content or the 'teacher-in-the-box' services that are currently\nprevalent in the market.\nConclusions\nBy subjecting the framework developed in our earlier work (Mayes and Fowler, 1999) to\nthe perspective offered by Wenger's work on communities of learning we have shifted the\nfocus of our work in the following ways:\n\u2022 moving the emphasis of learning away from the 'what' we learn to the 'who' we learn\nfrom;\n\u2022 more directly addressing the key factor of motivation to learn;\n\u2022 providing a bridging framework from which both pedagogical and organization design\ncan be derived;\n\u2022 offering insights into how best to manage change within our learning organizations.\nThis new emphasis helps to reinforce the point that learning within organizations and\nwithin traditional educational settings requires a common explanatory framework.\nIt remains to be seen whether we can move from the conceptual framework described in\nthis paper to the specification of a design methodology which properly embeds the\ntechnological support of learning in the wider social context in which the identities of\nlearners are shaped.\nAcknowledgements\nThis project is partially funded by the European Institute for Research and Strategic\nStudies in Telecommunication (EURESCOM) and involves partners from BT (UK),\nPortugal Telecoms, Telenor (Norway); Finnet Group (Finland), Slovakia Telecoms and\nIcelandic Telecoms.

As with Miller, Galanter and Pribram's TOTE units (1960) it was seen\nas a building block from which more and more complex descriptions of learning could be\nprogressively constructed. (Larger TOTE units could be built from smaller, a process that\nmodelled the way in which practice builds larger skill sequences.) The framework referred to here\nis the second-order description, where the action stage was unpacked into stages of\nconceptualization, construction and dialogue. The framework is intended less as a description of\nlearning and more as an illustration of design principles that can be distilled from a range of\npsychological, social and educational literatures.\n14\nMt-j Volume 7 Number 3\nReferences\nAnderson, J.
