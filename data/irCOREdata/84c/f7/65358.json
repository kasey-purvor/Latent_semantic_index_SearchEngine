Introduction\n[2] Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems\nemploy antenna arrays at both the transmitter and re-\nceiver. It is well known that MIMO systems can improve\nthe spectral efficiency of communication links by pro-\nviding substantial increases in data rates without in-\ncreased bandwidth [Foschini, 1996; Shiu et al., 2000;\nGesbert et al., 2002; Lim et al., 2007]. For MIMO to be\nsuccessful, a rich fading or scattering environment is\nrequired which, in effect, facilitates the creation of a\nnumber of parallel channels that carry different data\nstreams. Under ideal conditions, the channel capacity\ncan increase linearly with the lower of the number of\ntransmit\/receive antennas. Therefore, in contrast to tra-\nditional techniques such as diversity that mitigate the\neffects of fading, MIMO systems exploit the presence of\nmultipath to enhance the channel capacity. Furthermore,\nthe more decorrelated the signals are between the indi-\nvidual antenna elements at both ends of the link, the\ngreater is the advantage obtained. To date,MIMO research\nhas focused primarily on short-range wireless communi-\ncations within the VHF band and above [Foschini, 1996;\nShiu et al., 2000; Gesbert et al., 2002; Lim et al., 2007]\nand has not been widely addressed in the lower-frequency\nbands.\n[3] At HF (3\u201330 MHz), radio waves are capable of\ntraveling well beyond line of sight by means of reflec-\ntions from the ionosphere. These paths may be either\nsingle hop or multiple hop reflections from the different\nionospheric regions (the E region and\/or the F region).\nAdditionally, because of the presence of the earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field, each incident radio wave splits into two\nelectromagnetic components known as the ordinary (O)\nand the extraordinary (X) modes. The two magnetoionic\ncomponents take different paths through the ionosphere\nand arrive at the receiver as elliptically polarized signals\nwith opposite rotational sense. The actual number of\nmultipath components connecting a transmitter to a\nreceiver depends on the geometry of the radio link, the\nfrequency of operation, the time of day, season, geomag-\nnetic activity and sunspot number. Therefore, an HF\npropagation path through the ionosphere is prone to\nextensive fading as a consequence of time variant multi-\npath and multimode propagation. Consequently, it\nwould appear that the use of HF signals in a multi-\nelement transmitter-receiver system would be an ideal\ncandidate for a MIMO system. So far, however, apart\nfrom the research outlined by Xu et al. [2004], Brine et\nal. [2006], and Strangeways [2006], there has been no\nRADIO SCIENCE, VOL. 44, RS0A19, doi:10.1029\/2008RS004075, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Engineering, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.\n2School of Engineering, Durham University, Durham, UK.\n3IETR, UMR6164, Universite\u00b4 de Rennes 1, CNRS, Rennes, France.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0048-6604\/09\/2008RS004075$11.00\nRS0A19 1 of 15\nexperimental or modeling research conducted in this\narea.\n[4] Between September 2007 and September 2008, the\nauthors undertook a number of experimental campaigns\nto investigate the feasibility of applying MIMO tech-\nniques within the HF band [Gunashekar et al., 2008;\nSalous et al., 2008]. This paper discusses some of the\nsignificant results that have been obtained in this study\nwith particular emphasis on the use of heterogeneous\nantenna arrays at the transmitter and receiver. (A hetero-\ngeneous antenna array is one that is composed of either\ndifferent types of antennas, or the same types of antennas\nwith different orientations, while a homogeneous antenna\narray is one that is composed of identical antennas with\nthe same orientation.)\n2. Experimental Arrangement\n[5] For the investigations carried out in this study, a\npurpose-built multichannel transmitter system and multi-\nchannel receiver system was implemented. The receiver\nsite was located in Bruntingthorpe (near Leicester),\nUnited Kingdom, and the transmitter site in Durham,\nUnited Kingdom, giving an approximately N-S path with\na range of 255 km. Currently, the system has the\ncapability of transmitting on up to four antennas and\nreceiving on up to eight antennas. In order to examine\nthe effects of antenna heterogeneity at the transmitter, a\nvariety of antennas were used in the measurement\ncampaigns (e.g., vertical, loop, dipole and crossed wire\nantennas). At the receiver, a spaced antenna array (an L-\nshaped array of five vertical monopole antennas) was\nemployed in several of the campaigns so that the effect\nof antenna spacing could be determined. The array\nconsisted of a 40 m long N-S arm (pointing in the\ngeneral direction of Durham) and a 40 m long E-W arm\n(see Figure 1). The two orthogonal arms of this configu-\nration facilitated the examination of any orientation-\ndependent propagation effects. In some of the campaigns,\nadditional antennas (e.g., loops and crossed wires) were\nalso utilized to introduce heterogeneity at the receiver.\nMore recently, the feasibility of deploying compact,\ncolocated, heterogeneous antenna arrays at the receiver\nhas also been investigated.\n3. Measurements and Analysis\n[6] Sections 3.1 and 3.2 provide examples of cases in\nwhich different antenna configurations were employed. In\nall the campaigns, data were collected over a period of\nFigure 1.

For the\nvarious transmit antennas, slightly different frequencies\nFigure 2.

Dashed gray line is the E-W arm of crossed wire array 1 (TX-1;\n5.255010 MHz), solid gray line is the N-S arm of crossed wire array 1 (TX-2; 5.255020 MHz),\ndashed black line is the E-Warm of crossed wire array 2 (TX-3; 5.255030MHz), and solid black line\nis the N-S arm of crossed wire array 2 (TX-4; 5.255040 MHz).\nRS0A19 GUNASHEKAR ET AL.: MIMO TECHNIQUES WITHIN THE HF BAND\n3 of 15\nRS0A19\n(offset by 10\u201320 Hz) were used. During testing, it was\nverified that the slightly different frequencies exhibited\nidentical fading when transmitted simultaneously on a\nsingle antenna. This result confirmed that the differences\nin frequencies (when used on separate transmit antennas)\nwould not contribute to any kind of decorrelation during\nthe MIMO campaigns. It must be noted that in the\ncurrent MIMO setup, the frequency offsets were required\nsolely to identify the specific transmit antenna signal\nsources, and will not be needed in operational MIMO\nsystems that will be implemented in the future (see\nsection 4).\n3.1. The 4 \u0001 8 MIMO Configuration\n(2 November 2007)\n[8] A 4 \u0001 8 MIMO link (four transmitting antennas\nand eight receiving antennas) using a nominal transmis-\nsion frequency of 5.2550 MHz was set up. For the\ntransmit array, two pairs of orthogonally oriented\ninverted \u2018\u2018V\u2019\u2019 wire antennas spaced approximately 22 m\napart (center-to-center distance) were employed with the\nfollowing specifications: E-W arm of crossed wire array\n1 (TX-1; 5.255010 MHz), N-S arm of crossed wire\narray 1 (TX-2; 5.255020 MHz), E-W arm of crossed wire\narray 2 (TX-3; 5.255030 MHz), and N-S arm of crossed\nwire array 2 (TX-4; 5.255040 MHz). Each pair of\ninverted V antennas was supported by its own mast\nand the orthogonal wires comprising each pair were\ncrossed at the same point on their respective masts\n(approximately 9 m above ground level). The N-S arms\nof the two crossed wire antennas were oriented in such a\nway that they were pointing toward the receiving site\n(bearing is 173\u0001).\n[9] For the receive array of Figure 1, in addition to the\nL-shaped configuration of five vertical monopoles (RX-\n1\u2013RX-5), a square loop antenna (side length \u00021.5 m;\nE-W orientation) (RX-6) and a pair of orthogonally\noriented inverted V antennas (RX-7, RX-8) were set up.\nBoth the inverted V antennas (wire length \u000232 m) were\nsupported by the same mast and were crossed at the\nsame point on the mast (approximately 7.6 m above\nground level). The N-S arm of the receiver crossed wire\nantenna was pointing in the general direction of Durham.\nNote that the orientations of the loop and inverted V\nantennas are specified as the plane containing the\nantenna elements.\n3.1.1. Structure of the Ionosphere and Fading\n[10] For the majority of the data recorded, the ampli-\ntude patterns across the eight receiving antennas indicated\ndeep fading for all four transmissions. As an example,\nthe amplitude pattern across the five monopoles of the\nL-shaped array for CW signals received from Durham\nfor a period of approximately 1-min (at 1602 UT on\n2 November 2007) is depicted in Figure 2. The four\nsimultaneously transmitted carrier signals were recov-\nered at each receiving antenna after applying a filtering\nprocedure. When transmission curves were superim-\nposed on the corresponding vertical ionogram obtained\nFigure 3.

The existence of a strong E region in the\nionosphere gave rise to many more modes (1E and 2E) in\naddition to the 1F and 2F modes (and both the ordinary\nand extraordinary modes).\n3.1.2. Effects of Antenna Spacing and Antenna\nOrientation on Interelement Correlation\nat the Transmitter and Receiver\n[11] In order to achieve the MIMO capacity, it is\nessential that there is sufficient decorrelation between\nthe different antenna elements at both ends of the link. In\nthis investigation, the correlation coefficients were com-\nputed for various antenna pairs for each data acquisition\nperiod (of approximately 1-min duration). Specifically,\nin this paper, interelement correlation coefficient refers to\neither (1) the correlation coefficient of signal amplitudes\nbetween pairs of transmissions at each receiving antenna\nor (2) the correlation coefficient of signal amplitudes\nbetween pairs of receiving antennas for each individual\ntransmission.\n[12] For the typical period of data acquisition presented\nin Figure 2, the magnitudes of the amplitude correlation\ncoefficients between the individual transmissions at each\nof the receiving antennas have been listed in Table 1.\nExpectedly, the orthogonal arms of the transmit crossed\nwire antennas (i.e., the N-S and E-Woriented wires [TX-1,\nTX-2], [TX-1, TX-4], [TX-2, TX-3], and [TX-3, TX-4])\nexhibit significantly lower levels of correlation compared\nto the parallel arms ([TX-1, TX-3], [TX-2, TX-4]). This\nbehavior was also observed in other measurements made\nduring this campaign. The resultant correlation coeffi-\ncients for various antenna pair spacings of the L-shaped\narray in this example are depicted in Figure 4. In order\nto identify orientation-dependent fading effects, the\ndata from each transmitter (indicated by the different\nFigure 5.

Compared to the E-W arm, the correlation coef-\nficients between different pairs of antennas in the N-S\narm of the L-shaped array decrease much more rapidly\nwith antenna separation. Specifically, at the maximum\nantenna spacing along each arm of 40 m, the values of\ncorrelation coefficient for all four transmissions drop to\n0.30\u20130.60. This behavior could be attributed to (1) the\northogonality at the transmit end of the link and\/or\n(2) the fact that along the N-S arm of the L-shaped array,\nthe incoming radio waves would have to travel compar-\natively different distances (therefore resulting in more\ndecorrelation) compared to the orthogonal E-W arm.\n[13] With the receive crossed wire antenna array, the\ncorrelation coefficients between the N-S and E-W arms\nfor the 60 s data file collected at 1602 UT are 0.49 (for\nTX-1), 0.56 (for TX-2), 0.43 (for TX-3), and 0.50 (for\nTX-4). Figure 5 depicts, for each of the transmissions,\nthe occurrence frequency histograms of the correlation\ncoefficients between the N-S and E-W arms of the\nreceiver crossed wire array (a total 45 1-min data files\nwere analyzed). The majority of correlation coefficients\nfall within the range 0.3\u20130.7 indicating that under the\nprevailing multipath conditions in the ionosphere, the\northogonal orientation of the wire antennas is resulting in\nsufficient levels of decorrelation to be effective for\nachieving a MIMO capacity gain (according to Loyka\n[2001], for a 10-element uniform linear array, the\nMIMO channel capacity does not degrade significantly\nuntil the interelement correlation coefficient exceeds\napproximately 0.9).\n[14] The correlation coefficient occurrence frequency\nhistograms for various antenna pairs comprising the L-\nshaped receiving array are presented in Figure 6 for each\nof the transmitting antennas (45 1-min data files were\nanalyzed). The histograms illustrate the effect of spatial\nseparation at the receiver: the greater is the separation\nbetween receiving antennas, the lower is the correlation\nbetween the corresponding amplitude patterns and vice\nversa. Consequently, at HF wavelengths, the use of\nhomogeneous spaced antenna arrays (such as the L-\nshaped array) may, at times, require spacing considerably\nin excess of those employed here to achieve acceptable\nlevels of decorrelation for use in MIMO systems. The\nhistograms also highlight for the complete measurement\nperiod, the effect of antenna array orientation at the\nFigure 7.

Particularly\nat the maximum antenna separation (along each arm of\nthe L-shaped array) of 40 m, the correlation coefficients\nbetween the antennas along the N-S arm (i.e., vertical\nmonopoles 1 and 3 in Figure 1) are considerably lower\nthan those along the E-W arm (i.e., vertical monopoles 3\nand 5 in Figure 1).\n3.1.3. MIMO Capacity Estimation\n[15] To quantify the benefit of utilizing a MIMO\nscheme, the channel capacities (in bits\/s\/Hz) for various\nMIMO configurations were estimated using equation (1)\n[Razavi-Ghods et al., 2004]\nC \u00bc log2 det INr \u00fe\nr\nNt\nHH*\n\u0001 \u0002\u0003 \u0004\n; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere r is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), Nt is the\nnumber of antennas at the transmitter, Nr is the number\nof antennas at the receiver, H is the NrNt measured\ncomplex channel matrix and H* is the conjugate\ntranspose of this matrix. The entries of the H matrix\nwere calculated using the peaks of the Fourier transform\nof the received signal. For each MIMO configuration, the\ncomplex channel matrix was then normalized using the\nFrobenius norm as outlined by Wallace et al. [2003] and\nRazavi-Ghods et al. [2004].\n[16] The capacities were evaluated over a signal-to-\nnoise ratio range of 0\u201340 dB. Example plots of the\nchannel capacities corresponding to the typical period of\ndata acquisition presented in Figure 2 are shown in\nFigure 7. It may be noted that for the 4 \u0001 4, 3 \u0001 3,\nand 2 \u0001 2 systems, data corresponding to the first four\ntransmitting (TX-1, TX-2, TX-3, TX-4) and receiving\nantennas (RX-1, RX-2, RX-3, RX-4), the first three\ntransmitting (TX-1, TX-2, TX-3) and receiving antennas\n(RX-1, RX-2, RX-3), and the first two transmitting (TX-1,\nTX-2) and receiving antennas (RX-1, RX-2), respec-\ntively, were utilized to establish the complex channel\nmatrices. For comparison, the Shannon capacities for a\nsingle input single output (SISO) have also been plotted\nin Figure 7. It is evident that there are marked improve-\nments in the MIMO capacities for the 2 \u0001 2, 3 \u0001 3, and\n4 \u0001 4 systems over that of the SISO system. For\nexample, at an SNR of 30 dB, the SISO system yields\na capacity of approximately 10 bits\/s\/Hz while the 2 \u0001 2,\n3 \u0001 3, and 4 \u0001 4 MIMO systems result in capacities of\n15.6 bits\/s\/Hz, 23.6 bits\/s\/Hz and 29.3 bits\/s\/Hz, respec-\ntively. Similar improvements in capacity were observed\nin the other measurements. It may be noted that the\nwideband capacity can be obtained by taking the average\ncapacity of a number of carriers in the given bandwidth.\nThis, on average, can result in a higher-capacity estimate\nFigure 8.

The 4 \u0001 4 MIMO Configuration\n(3 September 2008)\n[17] Between July and September 2008, several exper-\nimental campaigns were conducted in order to investi-\ngate the feasibility of utilizing colocated, heterogeneous\nantenna arrays at the receiver. For this purpose, a three-\naxis, H field loop antenna array was designed that\nconsisted of three orthogonal active square loop antennas\n(each of side length \u00021 m) mounted on a common mast\n(of height \u00023 m), two antennas oriented in the E-W\n(RX-2) and N-S (RX-3) directions and a horizontal loop\nantenna (RX-4) (Figure 8). On 3 September 2008, a\nmeasurement campaign was conducted that employed\nthis antenna array at the receive end of a 4 \u0001 4 MIMO\nlink. A single active square loop antenna (side length\n\u0002 1 m) oriented in the E-W direction and mounted 2 m\nabove ground level was also deployed at the receiver\n(RX-1) at a distance of approximately 22 m from the\nheterogeneous array.\n[18] To examine the effects of antenna heterogeneity at\nthe transmit end, the following four different antennas\nwere utilized in Durham with a nominal frequency of\n5.2550 MHz: TX-1 (5.255010 MHz), N-S arm of an\ninvertedVwire antenna array (i.e., pointing in the direction\nof Bruntingthorpe); TX-2 (5.255020 MHz), E-W arm of\nan inverted V wire antenna array; TX-3 (5.255030 MHz),\ndiamond-shaped commercial portable loop antenna (side\nlength \u00021 m); and TX-4 (5.255040 MHz), vertical whip\nantenna. The geometry of the orthogonally oriented\ninverted V wire antennas was identical to that used in\nthe campaign described in section 3.1. The loop was\napproximately 8 m east and 2 m south of the central mast\nof the inverted V antennas. The vertical antenna was\nlocated approximately 15 m west and 2 m south of the\ncentral mast of the inverted V antennas.\n3.2.1. Structure of the Ionosphere and Fading\n[19] During this measurement campaign, deep fading\noccurred on all four receiving antennas for majority of\nthe measurements. The corresponding Chilton vertical\nionogram transmission curve plots once again denoted the\npresence of a number of multipath components during\nthe acquisition period: the ordinary and extraordinary\nmodes for the 1F and 2F paths were present along with\nmultiple components from E region reflections as well.\n3.2.2. Effects of Antenna Spacing and Antenna\nHeterogeneity on Interelement Correlation\nat the Transmitter and Receiver\n[20] The occurrence frequency histograms of the cor-\nrelation coefficients between the various pairs of receiv-\ning antennas for each of the transmitting antennas are\npresented in Figure 9 (79 1-min data files were ana-\nlyzed). The lower three frames depict the histograms of\nthe correlation coefficients between the various pairs of\northogonal loop antennas comprising the colocated,\nthree-axis loop array. In particular, for the perpendicular\npairs involving the N-S oriented active loop, sufficiently\nlow levels of correlation coefficient are observed for all\nfour transmissions, indicating that despite being colo-\ncated, the heterogeneous nature of the three loops is\neffective in facilitating the necessary decorrelation in the\nMIMO system. Over the whole measurement period,\nthe mean values of the correlation coefficients between\nthe perpendicular loops do not exceed 0.85 for any of the\ntransmissions (these have been listed in Table 2).\n[21] The top frame in Figure 9 contains the occurrence\nfrequency histograms of the correlation coefficients\nbetween the single active loop antenna (oriented in the\nE-W direction) and each of the loop antennas comprising\nthe colocated, heterogeneous array (located at a distance\nof approximately 22 m from the single active loop). In\ngeneral, the spatial separation is producing reasonably low\nvalues of correlation coefficient for all three antenna pairs,\nincluding the parallel oriented loops (i.e., single E-W loop\nand E-W colocated loop). However, as expected, the\nadditional orthogonality that the single E-W loop has with\nrespect to the N-S colocated loop and the horizontal\ncolocated loop is producing further decorrelation (the\ndistances between the single E-W loop and all three active\nloops of the colocated array are identical).\nTable 2.

The mean values (over the whole\nmeasurement period) of the correlation coefficients\nbetween the various transmitting antennas at each of\nthe receiving antennas are listed in Table 3 and are\nobserved to never exceed 0.75.\n3.2.3. MIMO Capacity Estimation\n[23] Plots of the average channel capacity for various\nMIMO configurations corresponding to all the data\ncollected during the measurement campaign (79 1-min\ndata files) and evaluated for different signal-to-noise\nratios (between 0 and 40 dB) are presented in Figure 11.\nFrom the graph, it is observed that there are distinct\nimprovements in the MIMO capacities for the 2 \u0001 2,\n3 \u0001 3, and 4 \u0001 4 systems over that of the Shannon SISO\nsystem. Furthermore, despite using colocated antennas at\nthe receiver end, the channel capacities obtained are very\nsimilar to the channel capacities acquired with the\nconfiguration employing spaced antennas at the receiver.\nTherefore, under suitable ionospheric conditions, colo-\ncated heterogeneous arrays (as opposed to traditional\nhomogeneous spaced arrays like the L-shaped array\ndescribed in sections 2 and 3.1) will significantly reduce\nthe amounts of space required at both ends of a radio\nlink. With the relatively long wavelengths involved in the\nHF band, this is particularly suitable for applications\nwhere the deployment of large, spaced arrays is not\nappropriate.\n4. Concluding Remarks\n[24] For a MIMO system to successfully produce\nincreased channel capacities, it is essential that there is\nsufficient decorrelation between the signals received at\neach of the antenna elements of the receiver array from\neach of the elements of the transmitter array. As con-\nfirmed in this analysis, at HF, depending on the prevail-\ning modal structure of the ionosphere, the use of\nhomogeneous spaced arrays may require significant\nspacing to achieve acceptable levels of decorrelation.\nDecorrelation effects that are distinctly orientation de-\npendent have also been observed both in the context of\nspaced arrays as well as colocated, heterogeneous arrays.\nTable 3.

Moreover, in most of the\nexperimental campaigns conducted, antenna heterogene-\nity at the transmit end of the link has resulted in low\nvalues of interelement correlation coefficient.\n[25] This paper has presented preliminary yet signifi-\ncant results in the context of using compact, heteroge-\nneous antenna arrays at the receiving end of HF MIMO\nlinks. Specifically, a colocated, heterogeneous loop an-\ntenna array consisting of three orthogonally oriented\nloops is effective in facilitating the necessary decorrela-\ntion required in a MIMO system. Looking to the future,\nthe use of colocated, heterogeneous antenna arrays at the\ntransmitter will also be investigated. IETR, Rennes\nUniversity specializes in the design of compact, colo-\ncated as well as spaced, heterogeneous antenna arrays\n[Erhel et al., 2004; Perrine et al., 2004]. Experiments\nwill be conducted with the various IETR antenna\nconfigurations available at Rennes. Another compact,\nthree-channel, heterogeneous receiving antenna array\nis currently being constructed at the Universities of\nLeicester and Durham, the configuration of which is\nbased on the design of a unique ground symmetric loop\nantenna system developed by Massie et al. [2004].\n[26] The receiver system will also be deployed in\nnorthern Scandinavia in order to obtain measurements\nover a path with different, more disturbed, propagation\ncharacteristics. Finally, a measurement system using state\nof the art digital synthesis techniques is being designed\nthat will permit both narrowband and wideband measure-\nments to be made in the future. In particular, the\nwaveform generator will employ a direct digital frequen-\ncy synthesizer that will facilitate the generation of a wide\nrange of waveforms including CW signals with fine\ntuning, a modulated pseudo random binary sequence\nand chirp waveforms.\n[27] Acknowledgments.
