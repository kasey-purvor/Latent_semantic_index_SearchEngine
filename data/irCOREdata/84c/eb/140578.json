Risk\nmanagement, in terms of protecting the public health from pathogenic and\nchemical hazards has driven and continues to drive developments within the\nsector.

The sector has publicly stated\n(AWWA et al., 2001) that achieving this requires, at a\nminimum, that water is safe in microbiological and chemical\nterms, that it is acceptable to consumers in terms of taste,\nodour and appearance, and that the supply is reliable in\nterms of quality and quantity.\nDelivering safety, acceptability and reliability within a\nmulti-stakeholder, institutional and business context in\nwhich expectations are rising is challenging. Privatization,\nsector globalization, increased competition, emerging\ntechnologies, increasingly stringent regulatory control and\nthe trend towards financial self-sufficiency are all serving\nto transform the water sector, and posing new risks and\nopportunities (Westerhoff, 2003; Huber, 2000; Westerhoff\nand Lane, 1996; Kucera, 1993). Many within the industry\nare now promoting an enterprise-wide approach to\nrisk management as a means to ease and indeed exploit\nthis transition (e.g. Lifton and Smeaton, 2003). This\nrequires:\n(1) integrated frameworks for the management of internal\n(e.g. from ageing infrastructure) and external (e.g.\nfrom market processes or competitor actions) risks to\nthe utility;\n(2) the support of board-level, executive management\nand operational staff as well as that of external stake-\nholders; and\n(3) the effective communication of risk and engagement\nwithin decision-making processes both within compa-\nnies and with external stakeholders.\nDeveloping organizational cultures responsive and not\nnecessarily wholly averse to risk is itself a challenge.\nRecent international reports (Stern and Fineberg, 1996;\nEconomic and Social Research Council Global Environ-\nmental Change Programme, 2000; Prime Minister\u2019s Stra-\ntegy Unit, 2002; Royal Academy of Engineering, 2003;\nAustralian Academy of Technological Sciences and\nEngineering, 2002) have commented on the relationship\nbetween risk management and organizational performance\nand culture. Critical aspects include:\n. the importance of openness, transparency, engagement,\nproportionality, precaution, evidence and responsibility\nto good decision-making;\n. the critical role of taking a long-term perspective in\nassessing the potential indirect consequences of manage-\nment actions; and\n. a widely-held view that \u2018hard\u2019 quantitative risk analysis\ntools used in isolation of transparent decision-making\ndoes little to gain public confidence and can result in\nthe long-term erosion of trust.Te\nch\nset\nCo\nmp\nos\niti\non\nLtd\n,S\nali\nsb\nur\ny\nDo\nc:\n{I\nCh\nem\nE}\nPs\nep\n\/T\n04\n05\n4.3\nd\nPr\nint\ned\n:\n22\n\/9\n\/0\n4\nPa\nge\n#\n:\n10\npa\nge\n(s)\nOp\np:\nUN\nDE\nFIN\nED\nRE\nF^\n&\n_\nn\na\nm\ne\n;\nTa\nsk\n:U\nND\nEF\nIN\nED\nRE\nF^\n&\n_\nta\ns\nk\n;\n3B\n2V\ner\nsio\nn:\n7.5\n1f\/\nW\n(M\nar\n42\n00\n2)\n||T\nec\nhR\nef:\n9.0\n1\/H\n(M\nar\nch\n20\n19\n97\n)\n\u0001Correspondence to: Professor S.

There is considerable scope\nfor learning from the experiences of related utility sectors,\nfor example the offshore (UK Offshore Oil Operators\nAssociation, 1999), energy supply and nuclear industries\n(European Commission, 2000), and from companies at\nthe cutting edge of risk management. These combined\nexperiences will prove invaluable to the water sector as it\nconsiders the risk analysis strategies and decision-making\nframeworks it might adopt for more defensible and\nrewarding utility decisions.\nThe transition to an explicit risk management philo-\nsophy within the water utility sector is reflected in recent\nrevisions to the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO)\nGuidelines for Drinking Water Quality (Fewtrell and\nBartram, 2001; WHO, 2002, 2003). This is placing an\nemphasis on the development and implementation of\nwater safety plans for water quality management and,\nwithin these, application of risk frameworks such as\nthe \u2018hazard analysis and critical control points\u2019 (HACCP)\napproach (Dewettinck et al., 2001; Hellier, 2000) as a basis\nfor prioritizing risk management measures within the\nwater supply chain from catchment to tap. The approaches\nplace primary emphasis on achieving effective operational\nperformance than a narrow focus of monitoring finished\nwater quality (end-product testing) against numerical\nwater quality standards. The latter approach is funda-\nmentally reactive rather than preventative and is inherently\nless reliable given the limitations of monitoring in\nproportion and frequency.\nRISK GOVERNANCE\nCommentators increasingly refer to activity that inte-\ngrates risk management across legal, financial, environ-\nmental and other risks as \u2018risk governance\u2019 (European\nCommission, 2000): \u2018governance\u2019, because the frameworks\nproposed extend to the broader institutional arrangements\nand responsibilities for managing risk (e.g. National\nHealth and Medical Research Council, 2001; Council of\nStandards of Australia, 1999). Clarity over the account-\nabilities, both between and within organizations, is essential\nif risk management is to translate into practical procedures\nthat deliver sustainable improvements in service and\ndecision-making to the drinking water community. A criti-\ncal aspect is the capabilities of institutions in managing\nrisk. These can be thought of as the processes, people,\nreports, methodologies and technologies (collectively,\n\u2018risk infrastructure\u2019) acquired or developed to systemati-\ncally identify, source, measure, manage and monitor risks\n(DeLoach, 2000). Although mostly qualitative, attempts\nhave been made to categorize and rank institutional risk\nmanagement expertise. For example, Sharp et al. (2002)\ndescribe a \u2018maturity\u2019 model in which organizations\nprogress from being \u2018learner organizations\u2019 with ad hoc\napproaches to risk and reliability management through to\n\u2018adaptive organizations\u2019, which have an adaptive, respon-\nsive and proactive approach.\nThe structural hierarchy that exists even within \u2018flat\u2019\norganizations requires that risks are actively managed at the\nstrategic, programme and operational levels of an organi-\nzation (Figure 1). Typically, there are split accountabilities\nfor these risks such that the chief financial officer\/financial\ndirector and board have overall responsibility, supported\nby an internal audit or control function for the management\nof strategic risks; executive management for programme\nlevel risks (e.g. asset management, maintenance planning)\nand operational (e.g. site) managers for operational\nrisks (e.g. plant performance). Many companies have risk\nmanagement committees in place that monitor and report\non priority risk areas within the company, principally\nin response to requirements on internal control. Beyond\nthese company boundaries, there are important risk\ninterfaces with other institutions including the regulators\n(e.g. licenses to operate) and the capital markets (e.g. rais-\ning finance).\nAn important interface concerns the financing of\ninfrastructure spend and the raising of capital. Over and\nabove the levy of rates at the local level to support\ninvestment on the maintenance of water and wastewater\ntreatment systems, capital spend within public sector\nutilities is supported through the tax base and granted via\na series of government-aided revenue streams or funds. For\nexample, in the US, the Clean Water State Revolving\nFund (set up under the 1987 Clean Water Act) provides\nfinancial support to individual states to pay for sewage\ntreatment works, and the Drinking Water State Revolving\nFund (1996 Safe Drinking Water Act) supports capital\ninvestments in water treatment facilities. Within private\nsector utilities, capital (Figure 2) is typically raised\nfrom the markets, e.g. as shares or a bank loan and inves-\nted in a firm\u2019s operations (e.g. a treatment plant). These\ninvestments are treated as costs and include all capital\nand operational expenditure. Operation develops revenue,\nand if this income exceeds expenditure it is returned\nback to the investors or reinvested into the company. The\nlatter is acceptable if it leads to an increase or securing\nof the current value of the share price (Strutt, 2003).\nIn the UK, the water regulators [the Office of Water\nServices for England and Wales (Ofwat), the Drinking\nFigure 1. The risk hierarchy (after Prime Minister\u2019s Strategy Unit, 2002).\nFigure 2. Water utilities and financial risk (after Strutt, 2003).\nTrans IChemE, Part B, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 2004, 82(B6): 1\u201310\n2 POLLARD et al.\nWater Inspectorate (DWI) and the Environment Agency\n(EA)] have raised the prominence of risk management\nfor assessing company performance. Following the 1999\nperiodic review of the industry, Ofwat released \u2018Maintain-\ning serviceability to customers (MD161)\u2019 to managing\ndirectors of all water and sewerage companies and water-\nonly companies, underlining Ofwat\u2019s desire to formalize\nrisk management within the asset planning process. The\nprocedures developed by the UK water sector are of\nequal merit to public sector utilities abroad in that\neach company needs to demonstrate how the flow of services\nto customers can be maintained at least cost in terms of both\ncapital maintenance and operating expenditure, recognizing\nthe trade-off between cost and risk, whilst ensuring compliance\nwith statutory duties.\nOfwat\u2019s position has since been further clarified under\nthe \u2018common framework\u2019 outlining the requirements for\nthe 2004 Periodic review, embedding risk management\nfirmly in the process. The DWI in their letter (IL15\/\n2002), \u2018Distribution Operation and Maintenance Strategies\n(DOMS), DWI requirements and expectations\u2019 expands\nthe need for water utilities to demonstrably and explicitly\nmanage the risks from their operational activities.\nUtility managers manage cash flow, whether raised\nthrough public or private sector means, by optimizing\nexpenditure and income in the context of providing good,\nsafe drinking water. Events inevitably occur that reduce\nincome and cause increased expenditure. For example,\nfailures in the infrastructure\/distribution network causing\nleaks lead to increased expenditure on leak detection and\npipe repair, refurbishment or asset replacement. Public\nhealth incidents requiring emergency response and water\nadvisories often incur substantial costs. The techniques of\nrisk management are applied for at least one, and usually\nseveral of the following categories of risk:\n(1) Financial risk. These are risks arising principally\nfrom the financial operations and management of the\nbusiness. From an internal perspective, both capital\nand operating costs are reduced by carrying out assess-\nments during the design stage of a scheme, whilst\noperating and maintenance costs can be optimised on\nexisting plant. External financial risks are derived\nfrom market processes (e.g. currency rate fluctua-\ntions) and are of rapidly increasing significance to\nwater utilities, given the increasing need for self-\nfinancing and the twin trends of privatization and\nglobalization.\n(2) Commercial risk. Formerly considered immune to such\nrisks owing to their public sector monopoly, utilities\nare no longer insulated from competition or financial\ninstability. They face an increasingly demanding\npublic with powers to make significant changes if\nunsatisfied (Westerhoff, 2003; Westerhoff and Lane,\n1996). A serious accident can depress the share price\nin publicly quoted companies, persuading boards to\nmake management changes.\n(3) Public health risk. Failure or inadequacy of the\ntreatment and distribution process can result in an\ninterruption of supply or derogation in water quality\n(microbiological or chemical). The underlying causes\nmay include source contamination, human error,\nmechanical failure or network intrusion. The conse-\nquences can be immediate; there is often very little\ntime to reduce exposure and the impacts can affect a\nlarge number of people simultaneously. The financial\ncosts to the community of the fatal Walkerton out-\nbreak, for example, were in excess of Cdn$65 million,\nwith one-time costs to Ontario estimated at more than\nCdn$100 million (O\u2019Connor, 2002). The loss of con-\nsumer confidence has been enormous (Hrudey and\nLeiss, 2003).\n(4) Environmental risk. Equipment failure or human\nerror can lead to environmental impacts, including\ndischarges to the atmosphere, ground or the water\nenvironment. These may occur directly or as a result\nof actions to mitigate the results of the failure, such\nas discharges of polluted water from a tank. Similarly,\nenvironmental change can affect water quality. The\nrelationship between watershed management, source\nquality and water quality at the tap is inevitably one\ncharacterized by a need for sound risk management.\n(5) Reputation risk. For most water utilities and regulators,\nthe biggest fear is the loss of consumer confidence. If\nan organization has target levels in its customer charter,\nconsiderable time and effort can be taken up by custo-\nmer service functions explaining to customers and the\nmedia when incidents occur. The Sydney Water crisis\nof 1998 (McClellan, 1998) was estimated to have\ncost Sydney Water Corporation over $37 million in\ndirects costs with contingency costs estimated at over\n$100 million, for an episode with no health conse-\nquences (Quill, 1999).\n(6) Compliance\/legal risk. Legislation sets out minimum\nstandards for water quality, the handling and storage\nof treatment chemicals, the discharge of wastes and\nthe health and safety of the operational staff and the\npeople living nearby. Aside from the inherent risk of\nfailure to comply with legislation (with all its associ-\nated consequences), there is the risk arising from uncer-\ntainty regarding the future actions of the regulator\/\nlegislator. Even when there is no legislation covering\nsome aspects, there can be claims of negligence against\noperating companies and litigation for civil damages\nhave been prominent features following both the\nWalkerton outbreak (settled out of court) and the\nSydney Water Crises (largely dismissed, costs still\nincurred).\nAssessing risk across these and other categories then\nbecomes essential for optimizing operations and cost\/\nbenefit trade-offs. A typical issue is the optimization of\nworkforce planning (e.g. asset inspection or maintenance\nscheduling). In risk-based resourcing, human (and finan-\ncial) resources are targeted towards addressing higher risk\nactivities (Pollard et al., 2002; Figure 3). The presumption\nis that moving to risk-based resourcing (focusing on poorly\nperforming assets, the failure consequences from which\nare higher) yields greater risk reduction per unit resource\nof maintenance. Many water companies have risk ranking\nprocedures in place to inform maintenance scheduling.\nPrinciples have been developed for the proper design\n(Long and Fischoff, 2000) of ranking systems following\nearlier criticism over the implications of bias within these\nsystems.\nTrans IChemE, Part B, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 2004, 82(B6): 1\u201310\nRISK ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT IN THE WATER UTILITY SECTOR 3\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nDecisions on managing risk, if they are to be effective,\nneed to be active rather than reactive and well structured\n(Pollard and Guy, 2001). Risk management frame-\nworks set out the relationship between the processes of\nrisk identification, evaluation and management (Jardine\net al., 2003). They can be regarded as \u2018route maps\u2019\nfor decision makers. The principles for water utility risk\nmanagement have been outlined for the Australian water\nindustry to illustrate the value of developing a preventative\nquality management approach (Hrudey, 2001). One of\nthese, \u2018turning hindsight into foresight\u2019, has been deve-\nloped as a compilation and analysis of case studies of drink-\ning water outbreaks in developed countries (Hrudey and\nHrudey, 2004).\nClassical linear approaches to risk management have\nbeen replaced by iterative frameworks that adopt the man-\nagement processes of \u2018assess\u2013plan\u2013do\u2013monitor\u2013revise\u2019\nand that aim to engage stakeholders in decision-making.\nTheir application has resulted in a reappraisal of risk\nanalysis in which the relationship between the analysis of\nrisk and the audience is recognized as central to defensible\ndecisions. The US Presidential\/Congressional Commission\non Risk Assessment and Risk Management (1997) was\namong the first of government responses to take a fresh\nlook at the issue of risk management. The framework\n(Figure 4) recognizes the continuous improvement neces-\nsary for organizations to develop a mature capacity in\nrisk management and the central role of stakeholders to\nthe decision-making process. It emphasises the importance\nof (a) good problem definition, (b) management feed-\nback in making decisions, and (c) the central role of stake-\nholders within the decision-making process. Here, risk\nanalysis is viewed not as an end in its own right, but as\na means of selecting and prioritizing options for risk\nmanagement, that themselves require evaluation after\nimplementation, all set within a context of making better\ndecisions. These frameworks can, however, inadvertently\ncloud the explicit role of science and evidence within\ndecision-making. The \u2018process\u2019 and \u2018content\u2019 of decisions\nmust be viewed as equally important to the outcome, thus\ndevelopments since the US Presidential Commission are\nfocusing on making more explicit the role for scientific\nevidence within democratic decision-making processes\n(e.g. USEPA, 1999; Charnley, 2000).\nTOOLS AND TECHNIQUES FOR RISK ANALYSIS\nAT THE OPERATIONAL, PROGRAMME\nAND STRATEGIC LEVEL\nRisk analysis plays a role alongside other decision tools\nfor risk management. Not all risks require detailed analysis\nto be managed. In many industries there are accepted\nstandards of performance and codes of practice (e.g. engin-\neering standards; accepted best practice; Figure 5) that, if\nadhered to, provide high degrees of control. These are\napplied where uncertainties and system vulnerabilities are\nwell understood. However, complex, uncertain and novel\nsystems, and situations with a deviation from routine\noperation, may require risk analysis, so as to better under-\nstand what drives the risk from or to the plant, process or\noperation, thereby allowing management measures for the\nreduction of unacceptable risks to be targeted.\nTools and techniques for the analysis of these different\ntypes of risk vary by their sophistication and design. A\nwide range of approaches are available (Table 1) from\ndistribution modelling for the analysis of contaminants\nand pathogens within catchments, to probabilistic fault\ntree models for the analysis of potential engineering fail-\nures at the works level. The implementation of a portfolio\nof risk techniques within a water utility is contingent on\ninstitutional capacity, data quality and the requirements\nof the decision that the risk analysis is informing.\nOperational Risk Analysis\nHere we are concerned with the assessment of risks\nassociated with specific operations at plant level\u2014for\nexample, the risk of failure of a device or process com-\nponent, or the risk of exceeding a particular water quality\nstandard. A common technique used is a semiquantitative\nrisk ranking of hazards according to their likelihood and\nconsequence. Leverett (2000) describes the ranking of\nrisks from and to routine and non-routine process opera-\ntions within four risk categories: health and safety, water\nquality, water quantity and environmental. Analysis and\nprioritization assists treatment managers in identifying\nFigure 3. Risk-based workforce planning (after Pollard et al., 2002).\nFigure 4. Risk Management Framework (after US Presidential\/Congres-\nsional Commission on Risk Assessment and Risk Management, 1997).\nTrans IChemE, Part B, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 2004, 82(B6): 1\u201310\n4 POLLARD et al.\nand mitigating previously unforeseen risks to operations,\nand the planning of projects such as the shut-down and\nmaintenance of a strategic treated water reservoir. A similar\nranking approach has been used to identify health and\nsafety hazards at treatment works, e.g. with respect to\nhazardous chemical usage (Wirth and Siebert, 2000). Typi-\ncally, risk ranking is used to screen risks as part of a more\ninvolved tiered risk assessment programme. The National\nHealth and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), the\nbody responsible for issuing drinking water guidelines to\nAustralian water utilities, in their \u2018Framework for manage-\nment of drinking water quality\u2019 (National Health and\nMedical Research Council, 2001, Rizak et al., 2003)\ndescribe the incorporation of several risk assessment\nFigure 5.

In\naddition to risk ranking, the framework advocates the\napplication of a HACCP (hazard analysis critical control\npoints) methodology, namely the determination of \u2018critical\ncontrol points\u2019 whereupon risks can be monitored and\nreduced. The NHMRC framework proposes that utilities\nshould adopt a multiple barrier approach to risk manage-\nment (Hrudey and Hrudey, 2003; Deere et al., 2001),\nensuring multiple levels of protection against specific\ncontaminant threats. NHMRC presents an example of this\nfrom two treatment works, both with very different water\nsources: (a) a heavily protected catchment (Melbourne)\nand (b) a large river fed by multi-use catchments\n(Adelaide). In the Melbourne system, applied barriers\ninclude protected catchments, large catchment reservoirs,\nand good chlorination, whereas in the Adelaide system\nthe barriers are more heavily weighted towards treatment\nand downstream controls. Risk analysis has long been\nthe basis for the derivation of water quality guidelines\nfor drinking water (WHO, 2002). The substance-specific\nhealth risk assessments that have historically informed\nthe guidelines may, however, be somewhat distanced\nfrom the immediate operational context of individual\nutilities. The recent draft of the third edition of the WHO\ndrinking water guidelines (WHO, 2003) provides explicit\nreference to chemical and pathogenic risk management\nfor water quality control. Risk analysis tools are available\nfor informing utility decisions on risk management.\nThe New Zealand Ministry of Health (NZHOH) has\ndeveloped a pragmatic programme for encouraging public\nhealth management plans (NZMOH, 2001). Their approach\nwas developed with full awareness of HACCP but a con-\nscious decision was made to focus on \u2018events\u2019 defined\nas incidents or situations that may lead to hazards being\nintroduced into, or not being removed from, the water\n(Nokes and Taylor, 2003). In developing this approach,\nfour barriers were identified that, if maintained effective,\nwill adequately control hazards:\n. prevention of contamination entering the raw water of\nthe supply;\n. removal of particles from the water;\n. inactivation of microorganisms in the water; and\n. maintenance of the quality of the water during distri-\nbution.\nThe NZMOH approach targets smaller systems and particu-\nlarly valuable for systems with limited technical resources.\nTeunis et al. (1997) and Masago et al. (2002) describe\nthe application of quantitative microbial risk assessment\nin an operational context, in determining the risk posed\nby pathogens from specific source waters. The process\nbegins with the definition of the relationship between\npathogen source levels and the consumed dose, followed\nby the construction of a deterministic model mathemati-\ncally describing this relationship. The relevant dose\u2013\nresponse relationship is applied in order to determine the\n\u2018unconditional\u2019 probability of infection\u2014unconditional\nbecause at this stage no consideration has been given to\nthe distribution spread of the outcome. In order to deter-\nmine this spread, the first step is to generate the range of\nvalues for the input variables and specify their probability\ndistributions. The authors input these values into a Monte\nCarlo simulation, which through a process of iterative\nsampling provides a frequency distribution for the proba-\nbility of infection. Similar approaches can be adopted for\ndetermining the risk of exceeding water quality compliance\nstandards at a particular plant. In assessing the potential\nthreats to water supplies from ongoing or accidental releases\nwithin catchments, Halfacree (1998) describes the use\nof PRAIRIE, a PC-based software tool for assessing chemi-\ncal pollution risks to water bodies. The main elements are\nan aquatic dispersion model; hydrological, substance and\nstandards databases; and a tabular\/graphical output facility.\nThe model has a deterministic mode (used to \u2018screen out\u2019\nlow risk sites) and a probabilistic mode (for more detailed\nanalysis of high risk sites). The output results (e.g. fre-\nquency vs concentration curves) are compared with pre-\ndetermined criteria to inform regulatory actions on risk\nmanagement from hazardous activities within a sensitive\ncatchment.\nRisk analysis at the operational level is further concerned\nwith the reliability of the system components, for example\nin determining the risk of failure of a particular treatment\nstep. The analysis may be summarized (Egerton, 1996):\n. What can go wrong with the system?\n. What are the effects and consequences of failure?\n. How often will that failure occur?\nFor unreliable or heavily used equipment, an analysis of\nthe historical data is often sufficient for determining\nfrequencies of failure. In the absence of such data, there\nexist a number of techniques for assessing the frequency\nand consequences of system failure, including fault tree\nanalysis (e.g. Parr and Cullen, 1988) and failure mode\nand effect analysis (e.g. Demotier et al., 2002).\nProgramme Level Risk Analysis\nAt the programme level, we are concerned primarily\nwith techniques used to evaluate the risks posed by a simi-\nlar hazard at a variety of locations (e.g. mains bursts,\nprogressive failure of filter media\u2014in asset management,\nfor example) or with the wide variety of risks existing\nwithin a watershed. The availability of geographic\ninformation systems has facilitated the ease by which\nsuch assessments can be performed. Programme level risk\nassessments are typically concerned with the implemen-\ntation of strategies across multiple sites and geographic\nregions (catchment\/watershed planning).\nRisk analysis of infrastructure assets is widespread\nwithin the sector, and is a critical tool in asset management.\nApproaches range from the simple coupling of GIS\ntechniques with infrastructure data in order to visually\ntrack utility assets and examine their associated risk\nfactors (e.g. Doyle and Grabinsky, 2003; Booth and\nRogers, 2001) to the complex integration of data intensive\nGIS with hydraulic simulations in order to assess the\nrisk of distribution system intrusion (e.g. Lindley and\nBuchberger, 2002). On a national scale, the US Natural\nResources Defence Council (NRDC, 2003) recently\nreported on the risk to drinking water quality from\naging pipes and process plant across the USA with\nindividual city \u2018rankings\u2019 being informed by water quality\ndata, USEPA compliance records and water utility annual\nreports. Similar risk ranking techniques have been used\ninternationally to inform threat assessments of water sys-\nTrans IChemE, Part B, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 2004, 82(B6): 1\u201310\n6 POLLARD et al.\ntems in light of recent terrorist activities (e.g. Anonymous,\n2001).\nThe assessment of hazards to the quality of water\nresources within a catchment or watershed is increasingly\nsubject to formal risk assessment and can be expected\nas part of routine water safety plans (Umweltbudesamt,\n2003; WHO, 2003; UKWIR, 2003). In Europe, the\nDPSIR approach to identifying key hazards within a\nwatershed, by reference to the driving forces (e.g. popu-\nlation growth), pressures (sewer discharge), state (increased\nnutrient load), impacts (anthropogenic eutrophication)\nand policy response (discharge control) is being adop-\nted under the European Water Framework Directive\n(IMPRESS Management, 2002). Here, risk assessments\nare intended to inform a programme of activities targeted\nat raising the ecological status of the watershed. Various\ntools are available for the analysis of catchment risks. For\nexample, Wickham and Wade (2002) have developed a\nwatershed risk model of nitrogen and phosphorus export\nbased on the surrounding land cover class, whilst Verro\net al. (2002) describe a GIS-based mass balance model\nfor use in risk assessments of agricultural chemicals.\nGiven the plethora of potential catchment management\nissues in any improvement programme, there is a need to\nprioritize risk management within the watershed by con-\ncentrating on those measures that reduce the significant\nlikelihood of severe impacts being realised. Lytton et al.\n(2003) describe a generic methodology based on the\nsource\u2014pathway\u2014receptor model (Environment Agency,\n2000) that enables the evaluation and ranking of potential\npollution risks to groundwater abstractions. This ranking\nis designed to be used in prioritizing risk management or\nmitigation procedures.\nProgramme level risk analysis invariably involves\ntrading costs and benefits, such as in risk-based resourcing\npreviously described (Figure 3). When designed well,\npiloted and implemented with feedback, these systems\ncan provide a sound basis for distinguishing greater risks\nfrom lesser ones, and for investing resources in risk\nmanagement that are proportional to the risks posed\n(Pollard et al., 2002). However, these systems, whether\nfor driving maintenance schedules, monitoring regimes or\nworkforce planning, may also incur risk unless the conse-\nquences of resource trade-offs are themselves assessed.\nAn example relevant to drinking water safety arose\nfrom the actions of the Saskatchewan Department of\nEnvironment and Resource Management (SERM) prior to\nthe North Battleford Cryptosporidoisis outbreak in April\n2001. This provincial department held legislative responsi-\nbility for the drinking water programme in Saskatchewan\nand, when faced with budget cuts in the mid 1990s, it\ndrastically reduced the already limited field inspection\nand enforcement of municipal drinking water facilities.\nThis culminated in a SERM proposal to eliminate its drink-\ning water programme altogether that was tentatively\napproved by the Treasury Board in 2000\/2001 and justified\nas being based on risk-based decision-making. The sub-\nsequent North Battleford outbreak, infecting between\n5800 and 7100 persons in the immediate community plus\na large numbers of visitors from three other provinces,\nled to a public inquiry into the outbreak and the provincial\ndrinking water regulatory system. Justice Laing concluded\nin his Inquiry report:\nthat the current risk-based model employed by SERM since\n1996 is arrived at on the basis of economics, and has nothing\nto do with how best to safeguard the health of the population,\nall of whom consume water. (Laing, 2002).\nFor a provincial regulator to use \u2018risk\u2019 as a basis for\neliminating altogether inspections and field support at a\ntime when a substantial number of utilities were out of\ncompliance with the drinking water guidelines appears to\nbe a serious distortion of the concept of risk as the basis\nfor decision-making.\nStrategic Risk Analysis\nRisks at the strategic level include project, commercial\nand financial risks, such as those associated with infrastruc-\nture investment; merger and acquisition activity; company\nreputation; outsourcing; and the long term viability of\ninvestment decisions. Louis and Rogers (2001) provide a\nstrategic risk analysis of three investment strategies and\ndescribe a multi-objective planning model that seeks to\noptimize operational capacity and economic, environ-\nmental and social gains. The project and investment risks\nassociated with public-private partnerships are reviewed\nby Grimsey and Lewis (2002). Using the financing of\nStirling Water, a Scottish design\u2013build\u2013operate contractor\nas an illustrative example, they discuss the complexity of\nthe contractual arrangements within such partnerships\nand use a quantitative analysis of returns on investment\nto characterize the robustness of cash flows from each of\nthe senior lenders to this public\u2013private venture. Rothstein\nand Kiyosaki (2003) describe the application of portfolio\nmanagement theory to utility investments in order to pro-\nvide a balance of risk and return that is consistent with\nthe utility\u2019s strategic goals and objectives. This approach,\nfacilitated by tools including multi-attribute analysis\nand scenario planning, involves: (a) determining the set\nof investments available to the water utility and their\ncharacteristics in terms of risks (both monetary and non-\nmonetary), returns and resource requirements; (b) priori-\ntizing investment opportunities across functional areas\n(i.e. looking beyond departmental barriers within organisa-\ntions); and (c) selecting investment options by virtue of\ntheir alignment with established corporate goals and\nobjectives.\nGroup risk managers also need to consider risks external\nto their operations. Water utilities are becoming increas-\ningly exposed to commercial and market risks (Rothstein\nand Kiyosaki, 2003; Westerhoff and Lane, 1996), exposing\nthem to a climate of operational uncertainty, including cur-\nrency and interest rate fluctuations, competitive dynamics\n(the interactions between utilities in a liberalised market),\nand stock market volatility. In this context, recognizing\nthe link between risk and opportunity becomes crucial.\nTools and techniques to evaluate these risks include value\nat risk models, which examine gross or notional assets\nat risk (e.g. currency exposure) from a change in a key\nmarket variable (exchange rates); and scenario\/simulation\nmodelling, which can offer insights into how aspects of\nthe market may evolve. As privatization and globalization\ntake root within the water utility sector, in concert with\nan increasingly demanding regulatory and consumer\nTrans IChemE, Part B, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 2004, 82(B6): 1\u201310\nRISK ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT IN THE WATER UTILITY SECTOR 7\nenvironment (Westerhoff, 2003), the evaluation and man-\nagement of these risks will become increasingly important.\nIMPLEMENTING AND IMPROVING RISK\nMANAGEMENT IN ORGANIZATIONS\nMaking credible and defensible decisions in organi-\nzations requires an institutional capacity to be predictive\nrather than reactive when managing risk and an aptitude\nto learn from experience. Implementing risk analysis\nstrategies and decision-making frameworks requires clear,\nstraightforward procedures that can be understood, agreed\nand operated by all levels in an organization. \u2018Keeping it\nas simple as it needs to be\u2019 has been a mantra of risk ana-\nlysts (Morgan and Henrion, 1990). The implementation of a\nworking framework should not be seen as the end-point of\nrisk management (DeLoach, 2000). Businesses must strive\nto continuously re-assess and improve their capabilities for\ndealing with risk. Senior management must be able to\ndefine their risk management capabilities (both current\nand desired) and assess the costs and benefits of improve-\nment (DeLoach, 2000). An increasingly applied tool that\ncan assist in achieving this goal is the capability maturity\nmodel. Initially developed for the improvement of software\nprocesses (Paulk et al., 1993), the model has been adapted\nand applied for use more broadly (IACCM, 2003), for\nexample in the oil and gas sector (Sharp et al., 2002).\nRisk mature organisations have the following key processes\nin place (Strutt, 2003):\n(1) Core risk management processes, including (i) setting\nand allocation of safety risk and reliability require-\nments, (ii) performance of risk analyses including\nreliability and safety studies to inform decisions, (iii)\ndesign and operation of plant to meet specified risk\nand reliability requirements, and (iv) risk assurance to\nthe customers, stakeholders and regulators.\n(2) Typical organizational implementation processes\ninclude (i) the verification of management processes\nand validation of risk models and data, (ii) project\nrisk management (ensures risks managed to cost and\ndelivery schedules), (iii) emergency response manage-\nment, (iv) reliability, qualification and safety testing\n(provides assurance of performance), (v) measurement\nand analysis of data (assurance of what is achieved\nin service), (vi) procedures for the management of\nchange (identifying key differences), and (vii) supply\nchain management (sometimes failures and incidents\nhave their causes in products supplied down the\nsupply chain).\n(3) Institutional support. Finally, there is an expectation\nthat the implementation of a risk management frame-\nwork will be supported by organizational learning,\neducation and training and research and development.\nCapability maturity models have a set of well-defined\nattributes that can be used to benchmark organizations\nwithin a sector. A company\u2019s capability in risk manage-\nment can be evaluated by reference to these attributes\nand well-defined \u2018scores\u2019 representing a scale from poor\nto best practice in the demonstration of that attribute.\n\u2018Spider diagrams\u2019 (Figure 6) allow comparisons between\norganizations and cross-sector similarities to be established,\nshowing where further improvements can be made. Using\nthese models, it is possible to rank an organization\u2019s\nprogression from a learner to exemplar of best practice in\nrisk management. Sharp et al. (2002) describe five levels\nof maturity. At level 5 (highest), the organization is at\n\u2018best practice\u2019, capable of learning and adapting itself. It\nnot only uses experience to correct any problems, but\nalso to change the nature of the way it operates. Level 4\norganizations are \u2018managed organizations\u2019 controlling\nwhat they do in the way of processes with requirements,\nensuring these are met through feedback. A level 3 \u2018defined\norganization\u2019 can say what it does and how it goes about it,\nwhilst level 2 can repeat what it has done before, but not\nnecessarily define what it does or adapt previous experience\nto a new situation. Finally, a level 1 organization is charac-\nterized by an absence of the above qualities. Of fundamen-\ntal importance is the acceptance that resources are finite,\nand so desired capabilities should be selectively pursued\naccording to particular risks or risk types (DeLoach,\n2000). The value of these models of course is in identifying\nwhat measures are required for an organization to progress\nbetween levels of maturity in risk analysis and manage-\nment. Ultimately, of course, risk analysis as only as good\nas the decision it informs and risk management activity\nshould reflect sensible and meaningful conclusions rather\nthan theoretical perspectives that may run counter to\nsound judgements (Hrudey and Hrudey, 2003).\nFigure 6.

Embedding these systems within organizations and\nmaking them fit for purpose is the next step.\nREFERENCES\nAbell, P. and Askey, M., 2001, Process risk assessment: water supply sys-\ntems, in Risk Assessment for Environmental Professionals, Pollard, S.J.\nand Guy, J.A.
