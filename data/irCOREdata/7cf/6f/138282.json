It focuses on the role of hierarchy in balancing the need for \nstrategic coherence with the ever burgeoning plurality of organizational life. In \nrecent years, there has been a variety of academic discourses that have \nilluminated this debate. Often coming from different epistemological traditions, \neach makes a helpful contribution to the debate. However, I argue that none \nprovides, nor in some cases is intended to provide, senior managers with robust \nand practical methods of re-conceptualising the role of hierarchy in organization.  \n \nBased on this analysis, four key requirements for the development of theory in \nthe area are suggested. Using these principles as a starting point, this thesis \nmakes a contribution to knowledge in three interrelated areas. Firstly, by \ndeveloping the concept of voluntarism, derived from the field of political \nphilosophy, as an alternative organizational binding mechanism that alters the \nrationale for the role of hierarchy. Secondly, this concept is operationalised as a \nform of \u2018representative\u2019 leadership. Research data are provided which explore \nthe behavioural dimensions and cognitive antecedents of this approach to \nleadership. The findings are suggestive of a democratic orientation toward \nleading and organizing, and on this basis, the third contribution focuses on how \nsuch leadership principles may be more widely adopted through the vehicle of \nmanagement learning.  \n \n \n iii\nAcknowledgements \n \nI wish to thank David Butcher and Catherine Bailey for their guidance, \nencouragement and wide developmental support in all aspects of my work \ntowards thinking independently. \n \n \n \n \n iv\nList of Publications Submitted \n \n1.

Introduction \n \nThere seems little doubt as to the plurality of interests at work in contemporary \norganization forms (Child and Rodrigues, 2003; Caldart and Ricart, 2004; \nColbert, 2004). Such is the rate of change, complexity and interdependence in \nthe business environment that organizations have to be responsive to a plethora \nof stakeholder interests in order to survive (Clarkson, 1995; Donaldson, 1999; \nFriedman and Miles, 2002). The sheer velocity of environmental change now \nmeans that organizational success is likely to be as much the product of \ncontinual innovation as it is of efficiency (Child and McGrath, 2001). Such \ninnovation is recognised as being inextricably intertwined with organizational \nknowledge networks (Ashmos et al, 2002) and the willingness of employees to \nshare their social and intellectual capital freely (Stewart, 1997). Greater \nemployee participation provides organizations with the opportunity to self-\norganise, innovate and co-evolve in more effective ways (Ashmos et al., 2002). \nIn such pluralist settings, \u201charnessing the capabilities and commitment of \nknowledge workers is, it might be argued, the central managerial challenge of \nour time. Unfortunately, it is a challenge that has not been met\u201d (Manville and \nOber, 2003:48). Despite several decades of attempts to reconfigure the role of \norganizational hierarchy by empowering workers and enabling them to \nparticipate in organization decision making, little progress has been made \n(Heller, 1998) and employees remain essentially disenfranchised (Manville and \nOber, 2003).  \n \nFor at the same time as organizations strive to build the commitment of their \nemployees, they are engaged in a second objective tugging in the opposite \ndirection, one of coherence; standardising procedures, integrating systems and \ncreating consistent corporate cultures (Adler, 1999). The rational bureaucratic \nmodel of organising, implicit in this objective runs deep in managerial mindsets; \nhow can business leaders improve on such a well-developed concept of how \nhuman beings collectively best accomplish their objectives (Child and McGrath, \n2001)? Despite their best intentions to empower employees, most are still \nworking from a perspective that values unity and control over plurality (Brunson, \n2002). Thus attempts to liberalise the workplace through strategies of \nempowerment and culture management have only tended to reinforce a \nhierarchical approach to organization, one that values conformity, a priority \ntowards economic and technical values, power focussed at the corporate centre \nand top down decision making (Willmott, 1993; Cludts, 1999).  \n \nMarch and Simon (1958) and March (1991) characterised this tension between \nthe requirements for rationality and plurality as one of organizations needing to \nboth exploit past successes to increase efficiency whilst exploring new \npossibilities to facilitate innovation. Managing these competing issues is \nparticularly important in contemporary environments that often call for rapid \nstructural change (Malnight, 2001). Effective organizational governance is thus \never more concerned with finding the synergy between \u201cunity, solidarity, \n 2\ncommunity, rules integration and efficiency\u2026.and diversity, differentiation, \nindividual autonomy, individual liberty, disintegration and experimentation\u201d \n(March and Olsen, 1995:168). How these tensions are managed reflect core \nvalues about organizational democracy and this thesis is concerned ultimately \nwith how this ideal may be furthered in practice by more voluntaristic \napproaches to governance.  \n \nIn recent years there have been a number of discourses that have illuminated \nthe problem of reshaping hierarchy to take account of a plurality of competing \ninterests. These have included the development of stakeholder theory \n(Clarkson, 1995; Donaldson, 1999); Organizational Citizenship Behaviours \n(OCB) (Organ, 1988; Podaskoff and MacKenzie, 1997); Community of Practice \n(COP) theory (Lave and Wenger, 1991; Brown and Duguid, 1991, 2001); \nResource Based Theory (Barney, 2001; Prahalad and Hamel, 1990; Dierickx \nand Cool, 1989); and the nascent co-evolutionary and complex systems \nmovements (Lewin and Volberda, 1999; Brown and Eisenhardt, 1997). Other \ncontributions have provided helpful metaphors such as jazz improvisation \n(Weick, 1998; Hatch, 1999);, ambidextrous organizations (O\u2019Reilly and \nTushman, 2004; Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004); and organizational hypocrisy \n(Brunson, 2002; Huzzard and \u04e6stergren, 2002).  \n \nOften coming from different epistemological traditions, each makes a helpful \ncontribution to the debate on how to reconfigure hierarchy in dynamic multi \nstakeholder environments. However, despite offering rich insights into the issue, \nI believe that these contributions deal inadequately with four key requirements \nthat are central for the development of theory in this area. That is, they fail to \naddress one or more of the following: the need to (i) reflect a genuinely \npluralistic perspective on organization form; (ii) acknowledge the centrality of \npower relationships in organizational working; (iii) provide clear outcomes for \nimproved organizational performance and, (iv) address the individual \nmotivations of managers to work with alternative models of organizing. On this \nbasis, the collected work reflected in this thesis provides a contribution to the \ndebate on how to reconfigure hierarchy in a way that takes full account of the \nneed for \u2018employee voice\u2019 whilst still being responsive to the drivers of \norganizational efficiency and organizational innovation. Three interrelated \nacademic contributions are offered; the consideration of organizational \nvoluntarism as an organizing principle, its operationalization through \n\u2018representative\u2019 leadership and its encouragement through management \nlearning.  \n \n1.1 Organizational Voluntarism \n \nFirstly, I develop the concept of organizational voluntarism borrowed from \npolitical philosophy (Eztioni, 1999; Putnam, 2000; Verba et al., 1995). From a \ncommunitarian perspective, in the \u2018good\u2019 society the moral voice that \ndetermines the nature of good citizenship is the product of a diversity of \nvoluntary associations or communities. These groups serve to mediate between \nthe private world of individuals and the large institutions of society. The \n 3\nopportunity to participate in associations, free from state influence, is \nfundamental to the creation and preservation of liberty. However, most \nimportantly, a good society is determined by such voluntary associations \nimplicitly inculcating a level of self control in its members by introducing them to \nparticular values that reinforce individuals\u2019 normative commitments to that \nsociety. I argue that in an organizational setting, the concept of voluntarism not \nonly potentially makes good the shortfalls in existing theory highlighted but and \nalso provides principles for harnessing plurality whilst still encouraging voluntary \nlevels of coherence (Clarke and Butcher, 2006).  \n \nThe principle of voluntarism predicts that unofficially constituted groups in \norganizational settings are able to provide the level of self-control necessary for \nthe maintenance of congruence (Ashmos et al., 2002); a multiplicity of \nstakeholder agendas does not necessarily create organizational incoherence \n(Rowley and Moldoveanu, 2003; Thietart and Forgues, 1997). Further, such \ngroups are more likely to do so when they can express voice and contest views \nabout which organizational values are important to them (Cludts, 1999). As with \nvoluntary associations, organizational arrangements of this type would bring \npeople together to pursue interests through collective action, serve to distribute \npower, and mediate between individuals and the organization, thereby creating \na sense of involvement. Crucially, they would voluntarily facilitate the flow of \ninformation between different groups and the organizational connectivity \nrequired to stimulate innovation (Ashmos et al., 2002). \n \nThe concept of voluntarism offers practical principles for mediating the need for \nplurality and coherence because it responds to two complementary drivers of \norganizational change. Firstly, at a time of growing unease about the role of \norganizations in society (Bowles, 1997), and the attendant consequences for \ncorporate governance and social responsibility (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, \n2001) the issue of who determines the \u2018moral voice\u2019 in organizations is \nsignificant (Courpasson and Dany, 2003). In this context, voluntary association \nmay serve to mediate between individuals and their work organization in a way \nthat enables employees to contribute to this debate. In turn this organizational \nvoluntarism may enhance societal voluntarism. Secondly, in encouraging \ndebate about values, identity and commitment to local causes is enhanced. In \ndoing so, senior managers are implicitly encouraging levels of self organization \nthat are viewed as central to the pursuit of innovation and the timely re-\nconfiguration of strategic capabilities critical to competitive advantage (Child and \nMacGrath, 2001; Rindova and Kotha, 2001; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000).  \n \n1.2 Representative Leadership \nThe second contribution lies in the operationalisation of voluntarism as a form of \n\u2018representative leadership\u2019 (RL) Clarke (2006). This model is also informed by \npolitical institutional theory in which political leadership is characterised by a \ncontinual process of bargaining, coalition building, pulling and hauling amongst \ndiverse stakeholders (DeGregorio, 1997; Held, 1987). This behaviour is \nlegitimised on the assumption that political leaders are able to balance the need \n 4\nfor cohesion and diversity (Leach and Wilson, 2000) and self interest and civic \nvirtue, - the ability to forgo personal interests in the pursuit of collective \noutcomes (Starrat, 2001; Patten, 2001; Preston and \u2018tHart, 1999).  \nIn this context, leadership reflects a collective phenomenon (Barker, 1997) in \nwhich the representation of different organization constituencies, by a wide \nrange of individuals assumes a greater significance. I argue that this behaviour \nis characterised by four behaviour sets; (1) representing the interests of \nconstituencies not immediately connected with a leader\u2019s own formal \nresponsibilities; (2) providing others with space, autonomy and power to \nexperiment; (3) encouraging debate and challenge, and providing opportunity \nfor voice; and (4) constructive political behaviour. My research Clarke (2006) \nindicates that the individual cognitions that enable these behaviours are \nreflective of attitudes that legitimise individual agency. When individuals \nperceive plurality as highly legitimate, the tension between the pursuit of \ncoherence and diversity is negotiated in a way that encourages the affirmation \nof self identity and autonomy as being dependent on those of others (Alvesson \nand Willmott, 2002; Knights and McCabe, 2003). That is, they recognise \u201cthat \nthe very source of [this] individuality is, in effect, social not individual\u201d (Knights \nand McCabe (2003:1594). In doing so, and in the absence of any alternative \nmodel, these managers largely \u2018make it up for themselves\u2019. In seeking to work \nwith the tensions of plurality and coherence, they arrive at their own conclusions \nlargely irrespective of immediate organizational circumstance.  \n \n1.3 Management Learning \n \nOn the basis of the argument to be developed here, that voluntarism can \ncontribute both business and emancipatory benefits, the third contribution \naddresses the issue of how to encourage the wider adoption of a voluntaristic \nmindset in contemporary organizational forms, where the dominance of unitary \nthinking is likely to undermine its legitimisation (Clarke, 1999a, 1999b). I \nconsider the development of managers as being central to this process. Yet the \npotential for Management Learning (ML) to impact on the coherence-plurality \ndebate has been largely unfulfilled. For Burgoyne and Jackson, ML\u2019s \neffectiveness has been curtailed by a preoccupation with unitary values \n(1997:54). This has the effect of oversimplifying ML processes by excluding the \ncognitive, symbolic and political elements of management development activity. \nIn turn, this has led to a situation where many organizational management \ndevelopment initiatives have failed to make a substantive impact on \norganization behaviour because they focus on an idealized notion of what \nshould be happening, rather than factoring in inherent organizational and \ninterpersonal complexities (Clarke, 1999b).  \n \nIn contrast, I argue that ML provides a vehicle for the wider adoption of \nvoluntarism for three particular reasons. Firstly, the aspirational adult education \n(AE) values reflected in ML; above all, enlightenment, personal autonomy and \nemancipation, are integral to the processes of voluntarism (Clarke and Butcher, \n2006). In essence, voluntarism is concerned with effecting greater levels of \n 5\norganizational democracy - the freedom to deliberate and make choices. I argue \nthat AE\/ML, at least in theory, is also fundamentally concerned with this process \nat an individual level (Burgoyne and Jackson, 1997). In consequence, liberal \nmanagement educators should see a natural affinity with the goals of \nvoluntarism. Secondly, in this regard, I argue that a voluntaristic mindset \nprovides both the means and ends for management educators. That is, if liberal \nmanagement educators struggle to realise their emancipatory project in reality, \nthe attainment of this goal can be accelerated by this community\u2019s adoption of \nRL behaviours that will enable them to represent more effectively the different \nagendas of managers and business. Thirdly, as the need for managers who are \ncapable of embracing a plurality of organizational agendas increases, business \nleaders may well turn to ML, as an accepted source of development, to help \neffect such change. Indeed, at this point in time, in an environment where \nunitarist thinking predominates organizational working, if change is not initiated \nthrough ML, from where else will it come? Business schools in particular have a \nrole to play here. \n \nI argue that in contemporary society, business schools carry a symbolic value \nfor business, and are viewed, as evidenced by recent negative critique of \nbusiness education, as capable of exerting a disproportionate influence on \nmanagement behaviour. Thus even small changes in the institutional approach \nof business schools may assume significance far beyond the immediacy of a \ndifferentiated educational programme and have the potential to exact an undue \ninfluence upon business. On this basis, the drivers of, and barriers to, change at \nboth a business school and individual level will be explored and the rationale for \nchanges in both the supply and demand of B school based ML considered. The \npedagogic principles required to effect a voluntaristic mindset will also be \nexplicated.  \n \n1.4 Values: Ontological and Epistemological Orientation \n \nThis PhD by publication represents a sample of my writing over 10 years and \ntherefore reflects some variation in epistemological and ontological perspective. \nThis is for two reasons. Firstly, as one would anticipate, my thinking has \nmatured and developed over this time as I have explored and experimented \nwith different perspectives. I see this as the fruit of a constructive process of self \nreflection rather than an eclectic approach to management research. Secondly, \nthis development process has been influenced by researching and writing with \ncolleagues of different orientations where the output is co-authored and \ntherefore reflective of a mutually beneficial ontological position. Nevertheless a \nset of common value premises informs all of this work. \n \nConnell and Nord (1996) argue that debates over the role of epistemological \nand ontological differences have been overstated and that a more fruitful \nmethod of differentiating perspective is to focus on value differences. They \nclassify these as values concerned with pursuing precision (exact \ndescriptive\/predictive patterns), expansiveness (to add or change existing \npatterns), emancipation (freeing people from frozen social relations), and power \n 6\n(gaining influence\/resources). In this regard my work has been heavily informed \nby an \u2018emancipatory\u2019 and \u2018expansive\u2019 agenda, both of which, in turn, can be \nviewed as drivers of societal voluntarism. Connell and Nord (1996) also note \nthat scholars in this field are increasingly willing to discuss their values, and in \nthis spirit, I acknowledge that in this thesis my own agenda is one of enhancing \norganizational democracy as a vehicle for improving organizational \nperformance.  \n \nThese values have led to a research orientation located between the polar \nextremes of positivism and phenomenology. Positivism does not acknowledge \nthe social construction of institutionalised relationships inherent in a voluntaristic \napproach to civil society and the pure interpretivist view is ill-suited to the \nresearcher who wishes to change existing patterns by adding his or her own \ntheories through the speculation of social mechanisms and causal tendencies \n(Partington, 2000).  \n \nIn practice, this has led to an ontology that has developed from an initially broad \nemphasis on social construction (Berger and Luckman, 1966), to more recent \nwork which has moved through Critical Realism (Bhaskar, 1974) toward \nStructuration theory (Giddens, 1984).  \n \nThere are of course differences between Critical Realism and Structuration. In \nparticular, critical realism places greater emphasis on the search for \u201cenduring \ntransfactually active mechanisms\u201d (Bhaskar, 1974:20), and thus adopts a more \nstructuralist or materialist ontology than Structuration (Blaikie, 1993). However, \nStructuration theory attempts to bridge the traditional divide between \nsubjectivism and objectivism by addressing the duality between agency and \nstructure (Blaikie, 1993). What distinguishes this perspective is the belief that \nsocial theory needs to be more clearly connected to the analysis of the \nproperties of institutionalised structures and their interpretation and \nreinterpretation by social actors. In this way my transition from Critical Realism \ntoward a Giddensian ontology reflects themes that are consistent with both \nviewpoints. Both are interpretivist in orientation (Blaikie, 1993), both \nacknowledge the social reproduction of structures, and distinguish between the \nknowledge (meanings) used in social action and the beliefs (motives) that \nprompt or rationalise it (Blaikie, 1993). In this regard both can be seen to reside \nwithin a hermeneutic tradition that seeks to make sense of others actions within \nthe context of one\u2019s own horizons of understanding (Chia, 2002).  \n \nThe research methodology I have used is reflective of these common themes. \nQualitative case studies have been the favoured methodology throughout, a \nstrategy that fits well within a Giddensian approach as it allows for a focus on \nhow individuals make sense of, and understand, their environment (Easterby \nSmith et al., 2002). It is also particularly conducive to the interpretivist \norientation in which priority is given to obtaining rich and sensitive data, whilst \nallowing for both deductive and inductive approaches to theory building (Miles \nand Huberman, 1994; Harrison, 2002). \n \n 7\n1.5 Content and Contribution of Collected Papers \n \n1. Clarke M. (1999a), Management Development: a New Role in Social \nChange? Management Decision, 37(10) 767-778. \n \nThis paper represents an early mapping of the territory covered in this synopsis \nand reflects ideas that are elaborated in papers 3-7 below. This exploratory \npaper draws together embryonic thinking about how self organised, bottom \nup\/voluntaristic action might be facilitated by political activity and developed \nthrough a cynical (sic) critical viewpoint. It is reflective of early thinking about the \nemancipatory potential of a political mindset and also considers in very broad \nterms how ML might play a wider role in stimulating this process of change. This \nidea is developed further in section 5. \n \nPeter Brodbeck has referenced the paper heavily in two papers in Team \nPerformance Management (2002a) and Business Process Management Journal \n(2002b). Both focus on the importance of self organization in organization \ndesign. Brodbeck cites the work in these papers to challenge rational \nbureaucratic approaches to managing by encouraging self organizing \u201cpockets \nof good practice\u201d. However, Brodbeck questions the overt political\/subversive \ndimension of this approach, preferring a more indirect approach over a longer \nperiod of time. Bernard Burnes also cites this paper in the International Journal \nof Management Reviews (2005) as a critique of the effectiveness of \norganization-wide change programmes and to highlight the paucity of change \nmanagement expertise in such activity. \n \n2.

(1999b), Management development as a game of meaningless \noutcomes, Human Resources Management Journal, 9(2) 38-49. \n \nThis early paper reflects a personal frustration at the lack of real value derived \nfrom much ML activity. It examines how executive education is enacted within \nthe workplace and explores the psychological and institutional barriers that \ninhibit effective learning. The wider social impact of this is explored and the \npotential role of business schools and ML professionals in undermining this \nmalaise considered. The ideas in this paper are re-examined and developed in \npaper 4 below and in section 5 of this thesis. \n \nChris Mabey in the Journal of Management Studies (2002), and Mabey and \nRamirez in the International Journal of Human Resource Management (2005) \nhave cited this paper to indicate the capacity managers have for serving their \nown interests by collusive game playing with those investing in and designing \nmanagement development activities. William Tate (2004) cites the paper in \nLeadership in Organizations, edited by John Storey. He uses the paper to \nhighlight the need for management educators to undermine the assumptions \nand values that create such game playing in order to deliver more effective ML \nsolutions (2004:307). Finch-Lees et al., (2005) in Human Relations and Heraty \nand Morley in the Journal of Management Development, have cited the paper \n 8\nas evidence to counter the claim that most management development is \neffective (2003:67). \n \n3.

As such it reflects a central platform in my work on \nvoluntarism. The paper provides practical advice on how to work with a \nconstructive political \u2018mindset\u2019 and highlights how such behaviour underpins, \nrather than undermines the process of redistributing organizational influence. \nThe basic premise that political institutional leadership can provide a credible \ntemplate for business leaders is developed in papers 6 and 7 below and \nexplicated in section 3. \n \nJason Ferdinand (2004) extensively analysed this paper from a Critical Theory \nperspective in a contribution to Management Learning. The work was taken \nhere as being representative of an approach to \u2018ideal\u2019 organization democracy \nand was closely allied with the work of Coopey and Burgoyne (2000). Other \ncitations include James (2006) and Gunn and Chen (2006). \n \nThe paper is derived from the book, Smart Management, Using Politics in \nOrganizations (2001) by David Butcher and myself. Jim Stewart, reviewing the \nbook in the International Journal of Training and Development believed that, \u201can \ninteresting and useful book like this ought to be read by management students, \nespecially those on courses like the MBA\u201d (5:4, 2001:304). Philippa Wilhelm, \nreviewing the book for the International Journal of Organizational Analysis \ndescribed it as \u201cwithout doubt an outstanding managerial guidebook on how to \nopen our minds to a political perspective\u2026.\u201d (2003:382).  \n \nFurther iterations of this paper by Butcher and Clarke have been published in \nthe FT Handbook of Management (2004), edited by Crainer and Dearlove and \nthe Handbook of Organization Politics (2006), edited by Vigoda-Gadot and \nDrory. \n \n4.

The paper lays out the tenets of organizational voluntarism \nand explores its potential role as an alternative organizational binding \nmechanism that alters the rationale for the role of hierarchy. The implications for \n 9\nsenior executives and management educationalists are considered and form the \nbasis for the ideas discussed in section 5.  \n \nThis paper was described as by one reviewer as \u201cvery strong and makes a \nsignificant contribution\u201d and summarised by the editor as follows \u201c\u2026I particularly \nliked this article - it speaks to a number of things that I find quite interesting.

A distinction is made between the value premises of democracy and the \nstructural mechanisms through which those principles are enacted, arguing that \nwhilst the former have increasing relevance to the business organization \ncontext, it is the latter that strike such a discordant note when considered within \nthat context. However, the paper demonstrates that this is a matter of \nperspective, since the structural mechanisms of democracy are not enacted \nrationally. The paper thus offers an initial analysis of the main precepts of \ndemocracy to establish the basis upon which a comparison between institutions \nof democratic government and the business context might be made. The \nsignificant features of both settings are explored, together with the impact these \nsettings have on the enactment of leadership in each. Conclusions are drawn as \nto the differences and similarities between each context, and the implications for \nbusiness leadership are considered. (section 3).  \n \n6. Clarke, M. and Butcher D.

The potential for representative leadership \nbehaviour to assist in the wider establishment of democratic forms and the \nimplications for business leaders is considered. This paper forms much of \nsection 4. \n \nAn earlier iteration of this paper was accepted for the European Academy of \nManagement (EURAM) Conference (2004), \u2018Governance in Managerial Life\u2019, \n5th-8th May, St Andrews, Edinburgh. \n \nThis synoptic paper will also contain references to a range of my other \npublished work associated with these topics which include contributions to \nresearch projects, a book and book chapters and other academic publications. \n \n1.6 Key terms\/concepts defined \n \nOrganizational Democracy \nThere are many different conceptions of institutional democracy (Lijphart, 1984; \nHeld, 1987; March and Olsen, 1995; Dahl, 1998; Kaiser et al., 2002) that are \nused to illuminate the idea of organizational democracy. However, in simple \nterms most debates revolve around the appropriateness of representative \nversus participative (or deliberative) democracy models (Dahl, 1998). In an \norganizational setting, attempts to adopt the mechanisms of representative \ndemocracy have met with considerable criticism. For example, Kerr (2004) and \nHarrison and Freeman (2004) are particularly critical about its broad practical \napplication. Thus, organizational democracy is not conceptualised here in terms \nof grafting the structures of representative democracy onto organizational \nworking, such as extending voting power to stakeholders, but as means of \nenacting the value premises of democracy, that is, as a vehicle for enhancing \nself government and voluntary association (Harrison and Freeman, 2004). In \nthis context, I define organizational democracy in keeping with the notion of \ndeliberative participatory democracy (Gutman, 1995; Patten, 2001) which \nreflects the need for enhanced individual autonomy and the legitimisation of \nprocesses that enable such individuals to be self reflective - to deliberate, judge, \nchoose and act upon courses of action (Held, 1987) as free as possible from \nunequal power relationships. \n \nOrganizational Voluntarism \nDerived from political philosophy, the principle of organizational voluntarism \npredicts that unofficially constituted groups in organizational settings are able to \nprovide the level of self-control necessary for the maintenance of congruence \n 11\n(Ashmos et al., 2002); a multiplicity of stakeholder agendas does not \nnecessarily create organizational incoherence (Rowley and Moldoveanu, 2003; \nThietart and Forgues, 1997). Further, such groups are more likely to do so when \nthey can express voice and contest views about which organizational values are \nimportant to them (Cludts, 1999). As with voluntary associations, organizational \narrangements of this type would bring people together to pursue interests \nthrough collective action, serve to distribute power, and mediate between \nindividuals and the organization, thereby creating a sense of involvement. \nCrucially, they would voluntarily facilitate the flow of information between \ndifferent groups and the organizational connectivity required to stimulate \ninnovation (Ashmos et al., 2002). \n \nRepresentative Leadership \nA disposition in which managers recognise the need to engage in debate and \naction to represent matters of individual and organizational concern, irrespective \nof hierarchical position or explicit authority. The term \u2018representative\u2019 leadership \nis used here to emphasise the political dimension of this behaviour rather than a \nformal process of representation. Thus, representative behaviour is also most \nakin to principles of participative democracy, that is, encouraging difference, \nvoice, self organization and decision making (Patten, 2001), than to those of \nformal representation. As in civic and public affairs, these discursive practices \nare predicated on the basis that they help to form local identities and influence \norganizational values. \n \nCivic virtue \nTheorists have long viewed civic virtue or \u2018self restraint\u2019 (Gutman, 1995) as an \nessential aspect of citizenship and in consequence as a key ingredient of a civil \nsociety and constructive political activity (Dahl, 1998; Verba et al., 1995; Ruscio, \n2004). I define civic virtue here as the ability to forgo personal interests in the \npursuit of collective outcomes (Starrat, 2001; Patten, 2001; Preston and \u2018tHart, \n1999). For without civic virtue, democracy disintegrates (Renshon, 2000). As \nPatten points out, \u201cone of the goals of deliberative democracy is to move \nbeyond purely self interested adversarialism\u201d (2001:224). If successful political \nleaders are those who are able to create cohesion from diversity, such leaders \nmust demonstrate their ability to balance self-interested behaviour with broader \npolicy goals. The ability of individuals to embrace successfully this balancing act \nis thus fundamental to political leadership (Ruscio, 2004) and therefore also to \nrepresentative leadership (see above).  \n \nIn an organizational setting, this definition can be further clarified by \ndifferentiating it from the idea of civic virtue described in the discourse on OCB . \nIn most of the OCB literature, this construct reflects purely \u2018affiliative\u2019 behaviour. \nIn so doing, it avoids discussion about the legitimacy of existing power \ndistributions, negating the value of challenge and political action central to the \ntraditional conception of citizenship, and thus for individuals to change the social \norder in which they are located (Graham, 2000).  \n \nManagement Learning \n 12\nClarifying the definitions of management education, management development, \norganizational learning and related terms has become an endeavour in its own \nright. In this thesis I use the term management learning to indicate all those \nactivities that reflect the domains of both management development and \nmanagement education practice \u2013 from situated learning to formal programmes \nof higher education (Burgoyne and Reynolds, 1997). Adult education refers to \neducational activities that are (in theory at least) open to all adults, and \nmanagement learning is one subset of these. This definition also reflects the \nmanagement of learning (Watson, 2001a) and thus its politicised nature as well \nas the process of how managers learn. \n \nOrganizational Politics \nPolitics have traditionally been viewed with some ambivalence by managers \n(see Buchanan and Badham 1999, for a comprehensive literature review of this \nissue). For example, organizational politics has attracted widely divergent \nopinions, ranging from its description as \u201cgame playing, snide, them and us, \naggressive, sabotaging, negative, blaming, win-lose, withholding, non-co-\noperative behaviour\u201d (Stone, 1997:1) to \u201ca disarmingly charming and engaging \nmanner that inspires confidence, trust, sincerity and genuineness\u201d (Perrewe et \nal., 2000:117). \n \nI define political behaviour here as \u201cthose deliberate efforts made by individuals \nand groups in organizations to use power in the pursuit of their own particular \ninterests\u201d (Butcher and Clarke, 2001:18). Power in this regard is viewed as \nsituational and relational, derived from a plurality of sources and widely \ndistributed, rather than simply a commodity possessed by a small number of \nindividuals or groups (Burgoyne and Jackson, 1997, Butcher and Clarke, 2001; \nSwan et al., 2002). \n \nIn practice, constructive politics, as with its counterpart in an institutional setting, \nis a necessary and logical process by which diverse interests and stakeholders \nare reconciled (Butcher and Clarke, 2002; Held, 1987). Indeed, as with a \npolitical institutional model, in an organizational setting, significant interest \ngroups serve to check the power invested in formal hierarchy. Therefore, far \nfrom politics being an irrational organizational response (Stone, 1997), such \nactivity becomes a judicious way of managing inevitable differences (Coopey \nand Burgoyne, 2000). Following Novicevic and Harvey (2004), I view political \nactivity as a \u2018democratic asset\u2019, which reflects the varying capacity of employees \nto influence the way they are governed. Political activity such as internal and \nexternal networking, positioning causes, lobbying, and alliance building (Butcher \nand Clarke, 2001; Denis et al., 2001) are all therefore considered as potentially \nconstructive RL behaviours. \n \nRational Mindset \nMindsets are the particular ways that individuals come to think about everyday \nexperience, saturating attention to the exclusion of alternatives. They are driven \nby values that are created and reinforced at an institutional level, and define \nwhat is appropriate and inappropriate in specific contexts (Giddens, 1984; \n 13\nHales, 1999). Based on notions of rational economic man (Cludts, 1999) the \nrational mindset (Butcher and Atkinson, 2001) or rational myth (Czarniawska, \n2003) is governed by values about rationality, creating a deeply held belief \nsystem that then governs what is assumed about organizations as they are \nworked in each and every day. Thus, despite their self-evident diversity of goals \nand need for dispersed power, organizations implicitly remain places of unity \n(Huzzard and \u04e6stergren, 2002) where employees work with consistent \nstrategies towards clear corporate goals (Brunson, 2002). Top management \ncontinue to provide direction through vision and value statements that reflect \nprescriptions about desired behaviours. Key to these behaviours is still the need \nfor employees to appreciate the logic of working collaboratively in order to share \neffort and knowledge in the wider interests of the enterprise (Butcher and \nAtkinson, 2001; Cludts, 1999). \n \nPluralistic Work Settings \nThere are now several substantial bodies of work that highlight the increasing \nplurality of interests at play in organizational working; these include stakeholder \ntheory and complexity theory both of which are discussed in more detail in this \nthesis. The degree to which these interests are genuinely taken account of is \nstill a matter for considerable debate, (see for example in Thompson and \nDavidson, 1995; Willmott, 2003); indeed a starting point for this thesis is the \npremise that the rational mindset undermines many attempts to leverage \nplurality for organizational benefit. Nevertheless, it is my contention here that \norganizations have always been pluralistic inasmuch as partisan interests are \nalways a feature of organizing and managing.  \n \nHowever, given the dominance of the rational mindset in contemporary work, it \nis evident that plurality of interest receives more legitimacy in some settings \nthan others. For example knowledge-intensive industries often reflect \ndecentralised working, self determination, self organization and networked \nstructures in which diverse views and interests are encouraged (Cunha, 2002). \nAs Child and Rodrigues point out \u201cit is very unlikely that new organizational \nforms simply represent a passing fashion. They are being adopted in the light of \ncontextual developments that have profound and lasting significance\u2026\u201d \n(2003:343). The use of the term \u2018pluralistic work settings\u2019 in this thesis is \ntherefore used to reflect this transition towards organizational forms where it \nbecomes increasingly legitimate for stakeholders to hold a diversity of \nconceptions about organizational purpose, organising and intended outcomes \n(Huzzard and \u04e6stergren, 2002). It is important to reiterate, however, that I see \nrationality and the legitimacy of plural perspective as always being in tension; \nthey are at one level dialectically opposed, and at another, both essential \naspects of organizing (Brunson, 2002).  \n \n1.7 Literature Road Map \n \nGiven the wide variety of literature from which this synoptic paper is derived, the \nfollowing section provides a brief \u2018road map\u2019 of the main sources used, and \n 14\nwhere appropriate, also accounts for literatures not directly included. A fuller \ndebate about the relative value of alternative literatures is obviously detailed in \nthe following sections but is summarised here to help the reader gain an \noverview from which to navigate the multiple sources discussed. An outline of \nthis map is provided in figure 1. On this figure, authors\u2019 names are detailed \nwhere I consider the literature to be less well defined from an \norganizational\/behavioural studies perspective. Numbers (2.1, 2.2 and so on) \nlink the map to the sections in this thesis in which they are discussed. \n \nThe starting point for the thesis rests on a substantial body of writing that notes \nthe increasing plurality of organizational life. Some of this might be described as \n\u2018New Economy\u2019 literature that locates organizational plurality as a reflection of \nwider societal trends (Cohen, 1999). Other material is derived from stakeholder \nand co-evolutionary theory. The contrary view that these discourses are merely \nthe product of an anti bureaucratic rhetoric and bear little resemblance to the \nreality of organizational life, are also explored. The resulting disjuncture \nbetween theory development and practice is briefly considered from a \nstructuralist (e.g. Thompson and Davidson, 1995) and post modernist \nperspective (e.g. Brunson, 2002; Czarniawska, 2003). The view that this \nplurality is not experienced in reality by organization members, and how to \naddress this in terms of reconfiguring the role of hierarchy, forms the \u2018problem\u2019 \naround which the thesis is constructed. \n \nSeveral major literatures that illuminate the problem of reshaping hierarchy are \nreviewed and their limitations discussed. These are stakeholder theory, OCB, \nCOP, RBV and Complexity\/co-evolutionary theories. Detailed reviews of other \ndiscourses such as jazz improvisation, ambidextrous organizations, \norganizational hypocrisy and Theory Z were not undertaken as they were \nconsidered to be largely peripheral to the direction of most current contributions \non the topic of hierarchy. For example, jazz metaphors for organization design \ncould be viewed as a subset of complexity theory, and Theory Z, is now a little \ndiscussed approach. \n \n \n 15\n \nComplexity \/ Co-evolutionary Theories\nIncreasing \norganisational \nplurality \nincommensurate \nwith unitarist \napproaches to \nhierarchy:\n\u2013Gratton\n\u2013Cloke & \nGoldsmith\n\u2013Etzioni\n\u2013Child\nTheories\nReflecting\nIncreasing\nOrganizational\nPlurality:\nOCB  Stakeholder\nRBV  Co-evolution\/\nCOP Complexity\nDisjuncture \nbetween \ntheory and \npractice:\n\u2013Thompson \nand Davidson\n\u2013Brunson\n\u2013Czarniawska\nLacuna \nin theory \ndevelop\nment\nOrganizational \nvoluntarism as \nan emerging \nalternative \nconceptualisation \nof hierarchy:\n\u2013Cludts -Child\n\u2013Courpasson & \nDany\n\u2013Ravasi & Verona\nVoluntarism  \noperationalised \nas \n\u2018representative \nleadership\u2019\nEncouraged \nthrough \nmanage-\nment\nlearning\nImplications for \norganizational \ndemocracy:\n\u2013Identity \nformation\n\u2013Emancipation\n\u2013Politics as \ndemocratic \nasset\n\u2013Moral \ncommunities\n\u2013Liberal adult \neducation \nagendasOCB                   \nTheory\nRBV COP\nOrganizational \nPolitics & Power\nCMT B School \nCritique\nCommunitarianism \nVoluntarism:\n\u2013Etzioni\n\u2013Verba\n\u2013Putnam\n\u2013Steiner\nEnactment of \ndemocracy:\n\u2013Dahl\n\u2013Held\n\u2013Peters & \nWilliams\n\u2013Jones\nPolitical \nInstitutional \nleadership: \n\u2013Ruscio\n\u2013Leach & \nWilson\n\u2013Stuckey\nPolitical Philosophy\/Science\nStakeholder  \nTheory\nCommunity\/discreti\nonary Leadership\nIdentity & Work \nMeanings\nLiberal Adult \nEducation\nArgument of synoptic paper\nContributing literatures\n2.2   3.2   3.3\n3.3       4.0                               5.1\n2.1                               2.2                           2.3                      2.4                         3.2  3.3  4.1                 5.0             6.1  \n2.2   2.2 2.2\n3.2  3.3  5.5  6.1\n5.2       5.3 \u2013 5.5\n3.1                                3.3                      3.3\nFigure 1 Literature Road Map\n \n 16\nVoluntarism, derived from communitarian political philosophy provides a model \nfor an alternative conceptualisation of hierarchy. Its appropriateness to an \norganizational setting is developed with reference to co-evolutionary theory and \nliterature on emerging organizational forms (e.g. Courpasson and Dany, 2003; \nChild and Rodrigues, 2003). Brief critiques of communitarianism from liberal and \nparticularly CMT (Critical Management Theory) perspectives are provided in \norder to highlight the role of power and politics in the conceptualisation of \nvoluntarism.  \n \nIn seeking to operationalise voluntarism in behavioural terms, the political \nscience literature that explores the enactment of political institutions through \nprocesses of leadership was considered instructive as, here too, leaders are \nconcerned with balancing a plurality of interests. The majority of the material \nexamined here is limited to studies of representative democracy in the US and \nEurope in both local and national government, as the vast majority of the \nliterature lies within this area. The limitations of this comparison are noted but \nare considered to be largely the product of rationalist and positivist perspectives \non leadership, and thus at odds with the interpretivist orientation employed here. \nMy intention in this analysis is not to suggest that political intuitional leadership \nreflects all aspects of its business counterpart but that it is useful as a basis for \nexploring managing and organizing in contemporary settings (Peele, 2005; \nHendry, 2006) and, in particular, how this might illuminate an alternative \napproach to managing competing agendas in a business context.  \n \nThe resulting concept of representative leadership (RL) draws upon the \nemerging literature on community leadership (e.g. Barker 1997, 2001) and \ndiscretionary leadership (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2005) which fits well with \nan interpretivist view in which leadership is conceptualised as a socially \nconstructed and multi level activity that both shapes and is shaped by its context \n(Giddens, 1984). Processes of leadership are thus explored as being at the \ncentre of a complex pattern of contextual relationships. Trait, contingency and \nsituational approaches were viewed as reflecting an unduly essentialist \nperspective rather than as a \u2018meaning-making\u2019 process (Storey, 2004) and most \nrecently, overly preoccupied with dichotomous distinctions between \ntransactional and transformational characteristics (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, \n2005). This orientation was considered largely incommensurate with my \nontological starting point.  \n \nMy approach to community\/discretionary leadership is informed by a co-\nevolutionary view but one in which organizational power and politics are central. \nThis position is both consistent with political institutional theory and overcomes \ncriticisms of co-evolutionary and collective leadership theories\u2019 tendency to \nreflect inadequately the criticality of power (Ray et al., 2004). In this thesis \ntherefore, leadership essentially involves the exercise of power; \u201cthe means of \ngetting things done\u201d (Giddens, 1984:283) and is viewed, not simply as a \ncommodity possessed by one group over another, but as a relational \ncharacteristic implicit in all social practices.  \n \n 17\nThe exploration of the antecedents of RL has been informed by the discourse \non identity and work meanings (e.g. Knights and McCabe, 2003; Lindgren and \nW\u00e5hlin, 1999; Robertson and Swan, 2003). Sensemaking (Weick, 1995) \npotentially provides an alternative frame of reference here, but was not pursued \nas it is currently considered to take insufficient account of power and politics in \nthe identity construction process (Weick et al., 2005).  \n \nThe potential role of management learning (ML) in encouraging the wider \nadoption of voluntaristic working was informed by an examination of the liberal \nadult education (AE) values underlying ML. A reformist approach to AE \n(Thomas, 1982) derived from a conflict model of society, where, building on the \nwork of Paulo Friere (1972) and others, the focus for AE is to emancipate \nindividuals (by, amongst others, causing them to question power relationships), \nwas considered highly commensurate with my approach to voluntarism. A CMT \nperspective on management education was used as a starting point for \nconsidering appropriate pedagogic approaches to developing a voluntaristic \norientation as this explicitly acknowledges the political agenda inherent in such \nan endeavour and has also been at the forefront of proposing alternative \napproaches to ML.  \n \nThe literature on B schools was selected on the basis that these schools \nprovide a potentially valuable arena in which to apply these development \nprinciples inasmuch that the institutional templates within which B schools \noperate are seen to be increasingly subject to change. B schools thus provide; \nan opportunity for individual experimentation; protected learning environments \nin which to reframe managing and organizing; and, as an embodiment of \ncultural transformation (Delanty, 2001), offer a symbolic signal of change \nbeyond the establishment of differentiated development programmes. \nAlternative arenas for development such as professional associations, and in-\ncompany development, were not pursued in detail. Often heavily influenced by \n\u2018rational\u2019 corporate agendas the environment was not considered conducive to \ncreating the protected spaces necessary for the reframing of unitarist thinking. \n \nFinally, the practical conclusions are linked back to discourses on organizational \ndemocracy, organizational politics and change. \n 18\n2. The Research Gap \n \nThis section details the research agenda which this thesis addresses. It places \nthe central issue of the coherence-plurality debate in the context of broader \nenvironmental changes and identifies shortcomings in five current theoretical \napproaches that touch this issue. These shortcomings are related to a \nsubstantial disjuncture between the theory and practice of organization design \nsuch that many new theories fail to acknowledge the centrality of unitary \nthinking in organizational practice which actively rationalises attempts to rethink \nthe role of hierarchy. On this basis, four criteria for the establishment of new \ntheory in this area are developed.  \n \nThe work here reflects a detailed literature review undertaken in 2002-3 which \nformed the basis for paper 6 \u2018Voluntarism as an organizing principle in \nresponsible organizations\u2019. \n \n2.1 A Changing Society \n \nThis thesis takes as its starting point the idea that we are experiencing \nsubstantial shifts in the nature of the social institutions around us (Sparrow and \nCooper, 1998; Cohen, 1999). Gratton and Ghoshal (2003) describe this \n\u2018revolution\u2019 in terms of a desire for individuals to express their potential, the \nneed for protection from the arbitrary use of power, and involvement in people \ndetermining the conditions of their association (2003:1). These types of change \nare consequently transforming individual relationships with institutions at all \nlevels, but at their core reflect the primacy of individuals and their capacity to act \nwith autonomy (Gratton and Ghoshal, 2003; Patten, 2001; Vigoda, 2002).  \n \nAt the same time as demands for more participative organization forms \nincrease, hyper competitive environments are forcing organizations to be more \nefficient, responsive, nimble and agile in the way they interact with customers, \nsuppliers, and partners. In turn, this is creating many fragmented and \nstructurally diverse organizations that reflect varied and competing interests \n(Butcher and Clarke, 2002; Brunson, 2002). Thus, as organizations become \nmore complex they inevitably become more pluralist in nature. In these \ncircumstances sustainable competitive advantage is seen to lie in \u201cmicro assets \nthat are hard to discern and awkward to trade\u201d (Johnson et al., 2003:4). These \nare most likely to lie at the edges of organizations in the hands of line \nmanagers, such that more people, more often, need to be involved in strategy \nthan ever before (Johnson et al., 2003).  \n \nThese kinds of change in society are also encouraging business leaders to \nreappraise basic assumptions about the nature of jobs and the design of \norganizations (Cloke and Goldsmith, 2002; Sparrow and Cooper, 1998). In \nparticular, they are required to consider the costs and benefits of high trust \nsystems in securing the commitment of such autonomous knowledge assets. To \nwhat extent can employers trust employee capabilities to exercise responsible \nself direction and self control and to what extent should this self direction be \n 19\nguided by a dominant philosophy of shared values (Sparrow and Cooper, \n1998)? The criticality of this deliberation is made ever more acute by concerns \nabout increasing employee alienation (Bowles, 1997), and organizational \ncynicism (Dean et al., 1998). \n \nTaken together, these changes suggest that increasingly, talented and \nspecialised knowledge workers will gain market power and choose to associate \nwith those organizations whose values and cultures are congruent with their \nown (Rajagopalan et al., 2003). Such employees thus become organizational \nvolunteers responsible for their own development, career and destinies, and \nwho manage the deployment of their own resources (Gratton and Ghoshal, \n2003; Handy, 1997). For an increasing number of commentators, the need to \npositively respond to this plurality of legitimate employee interests substantially \nchanges the role and function of organizational hierarchy to a degree that \nexecutives cannot ignore (Cloke and Goldsmith, 2002; Handy, 1997; Gratton, \n2004). This task marks the starting point for this thesis. Managing these power \nshifts and plurality of interests therefore reflects a potentially natural evolution in \norganizational form that many consider to be more democratic in nature \n(Rousseau and Rivero, 2003). If this transition is inevitable, then what are the \nmarkers of organizational form that will facilitate this change in practice? The \nsignificance of this question has stimulated rich research and debate about \nfuture organizational forms. Five perspectives in particular have made a \nsignificant contribution to this debate: Stakeholder Theory, Organization \nCitizenship Behaviour (OCB), Communities of Practice (COP), Resource Based \nTheory (RBV) and co-evolution\/complexity theory. The contributions and \nshortcomings of these perspectives are briefly explicated below. \n \n2.2 Theories of organizing that reflect increasing plurality \n \nStakeholder Theory \nIn stakeholder theory, a firm\u2019s survival is seen as being dependent upon its \nability to create sufficient wealth, value or satisfaction for all its interested \nparties, including employees (Clarkson, 1995; Donaldson, 1999; Jones, 1999; \nFriedman and Miles, 2002). At its most fundamental, stakeholder theory \nquestions the primary purpose of corporations as the pursuit of shareholder \nreturn. This unitary approach to ownership is increasingly seen as \nunsustainable in a society where multiple stakeholders, in effect, \u2018invest\u2019 in the \ncorporation. Authors such as Etzioni (1998) claim that all such interests should \nhave the opportunity to participate in organizational governance. However, \naside from high profile debate as a theory of social renewal (Giddens, 1998), \nstakeholder theorists, as John Hendry points out, \u201chave either restricted \nthemselves to very modest claims as to the respect to be afforded to \nstakeholders within the existing legal and institutional structure, or, more \ncommonly, pitched their claims so high as to sacrifice any practical credibility\u201d \n(2001:223). Others argue that a more in-depth appreciation of the power and \nidentity of different types of stakeholder (including employees) and how they \nchange over time is required (Friedman and Miles, 2002; Jawahar and \nMcLauglin, 2001; Rowley and Moldoveanu, 2003). \n 20\n \nMuch debate in the stakeholder field reflects a central issue of this thesis; how \nbest to resolve the problems of a normative (ethical) response to a plurality of \ninterests, or an instrumental (economic performance) response to stakeholder \ntheory (Donaldson, 1999). Yet this dialogue has for the most part, been \nconducted in the arcane language of academia and had little practical impact on \nthe thinking of senior management (Halal, 2000). In this regard, Hendry (2001), \nRowley and Moldoveanu (2003), and to an extent Donaldson (1999), suggest \nthat more progress might be made if stakeholder theory gives greater weight to \nthe idea of the organization as a complex system of social relationships, an area \nof \u2018huge importance\u2019 in understanding emerging organization forms (Child and \nMcGrath, 2001). In this way, the ethical and economic conflicts of stakeholder \ntheory can be understood as being resolved in the same way as the moral \nconflicts of individual managers facing the practical dilemmas of everyday life.  \n \nOCB Theory \nAnother approach to the problem has been to encourage the development of \nOrganization Citizenship Behaviours (Organ, 1988; Podaskoff and MacKenzie, \n1997; Bolino, 1999; Turnipseed and Murkison, 2000; Ryan, 2001). These are \ndescribed as individual behaviours that are discretionary, not directly or \nexplicitly recognised by formal reward systems and that in aggregate promote \nthe effective functioning of an organization (Organ, 1988). This concept \ntherefore implicitly acknowledges the value of individual contributions. However, \ndespite many years of theoretical development, critics contend that the \nrefinement of OCB as a concept has been constrained by the reliability and \nvalidity of the measurement systems employed (Van Dyne et al., 1995; Allen et \nal., 2000) and is merely \u201cold wine in new bottles\u201d and indistinguishable from \nconstructs such as commitment and altruism that have been subject to more \nrigorous research (Latham et al, 1997). \u201cOCB is currently in danger of \ndegenerating into a contentless construct to the extent it defines everything and \nanything and hence cannot advance our understanding of employee behaviour\u201d \n(Latham et al., 1997:207).  \n \nNor is there any evident agreement as to the motives for employees to adopt \nOCB without which operationalising the concept at work remains difficult. Wide \ndifferences of opinion seem to exist as to the importance of context \n(Karambayya, 1990; Turnipseed and Murkison, 2000), protestant work ethic, \n(Ryan, 2002), moral reasoning (Ryan, 2001) and impression management \n(Bolino, 1999). Most importantly, Graham (2000) draws attention to the \ninherently unitary conception of the central OCB tenet of \u2018civic virtue\u2019. In most of \nthe OCB literature, this construct reflects purely \u2018affiliative\u2019 and conformist \n(Speier and Frese, 1997) behaviour. In doing so, it avoids discussion about the \nlegitimacy of existing power distributions and negates the value of challenge \nand political action central to the traditional conception of citizenship, and thus \nfor citizens to change the social order in which they are located.  \n \n \n \n 21\nCOP Theory \nA further avenue of research is to be found in the development of communities \nof practice theory (COP) (Lave and Wenger, 1991; Brown and Duguid, 1991, \n2001). From a COP perspective, the plurality of organizational life is reflected in \nthe conception of organizations as dynamic communities of communities \n(Brown and Duguid, 1991). In these communities learning, innovation and their \ndissemination take place in both formal and informal groups. The COP literature \nsheds light on how knowledge and innovation is freely shared or restricted by \nstructure and potentially provides insight into how senior managers might \naddress some of the tensions of coherence and plurality in hierarchy.  \n \nHowever, there has been a growing trend in the COP literature to emphasise \nthe idea of communities as a managed rather than spontaneous process, one \nthat gives preference to a discourse that omits the role of organizational power \nand politics (Fox, 2000; Swan et al., 2002; Contu and Willmott, 2003). Again, \nthis observation reinforces the problem facing senior management: how can \nthey encourage informal groups without recourse to diktat yet still create levels \nof organizational coherence? Some light is shed on the issue by Swan et al. \n(2002) in their study of networked innovation within the health care sector. The \nauthors note how a group of senior managers were able to address this issue \nby \u201csublimating their business motivations in the cause of community building\u201d \n(2002: 494). However, COP theory is essentially concerned with the relationship \nbetween work, learning and innovation (Brown and Duguid, 1991, 2001) not \nexplicitly with the reconfiguration of hierarchy. \n \nRBV Theory (omitted from publication 5 in order to meet journal page limits) \nThe RBV view of the firm focuses on internal organization as a source of \ncompetitive advantage (Barney, 2001; Prahalad and Hamel, 1990; Dierickx and \nCool, 1989). In particular, it conceptualises the firm as a bundle of resources \nthat are distributed across organizations which reflect differences that persist \nover time (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). This view places emphasis on the \n\u201cheterogeneity\u201d (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000:1105) of resources, particularly, \nhuman resources, as a source of inimitable advantage (Colbert, 2004). \nHowever, this focus on heterogeneity has been largely lost in much of the RBV \nresearch. \u201cThe large scale statistical studies preferred in the literature impose \nupon the discipline a flat, featureless characterization of resources\u2026\u201d (Johnson \net al., 2003:6). In consequence the questions of how valuable resources are \nbuilt, managed over time and how they generate improved performance are \nunder researched (Johnson et al., 2003; Priem and Butler, 2001).  \n \nIn practice, this indiscriminating view can serve to diminish the uniqueness of \nresources that it seeks to promote. For example, Bowman and Ambrosini (2003) \nnote that where organizations seek competitive advantage through the ruthless \nelimination of non essential resources, activities that promote difference and \ncreativity may well be lost, amounting to an \u2018incoherent strategy\u2019. As Child and \nMcGrath (2001) highlight, one consequence of the need for continual innovation \nmay be the acceptance of resource inefficiencies. In response to these \ncriticisms of the RBV, more recent treatments have focussed on the dynamic \n 22\nnature of organizational resources (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1997; Eisenhardt \nand Martin, 2000) in terms of organizational routines that are the product of \ncomplex social structures (Colbert, 2004). This focus has served to inform two \nother complementary fields of study, complex systems and co-evolutionary \ntheories, which also illuminate the coherence\u2013plurality dilemma. \n \nComplexity\/Co-evolutionary Theories \nThe nascent complex systems and co-evolutionary movements (Lewin and \nVolberda, 1999), both take as their point of departure the idea that organization \nchange and evolution are reflections of multi level and multi directional \ncausalities in both inter and intra firm dependencies. They thus also play close \nattention to the plurality of interests at play in organizations. Taken from these \nperspectives, organizations are viewed as complex adaptive systems that are \ncontinually self organizing and co-evolving (Ashmos et al., 2002). In particular, \nin contrast to some of the research agenda discussed above, research into the \nmicro-processes of evolution emphasises the influence of social connectivity \n(Ashmos et al., 2002) in mediating plurality and coherence. \n \nFor example, research by Schilling and Steensma (2001) suggests that firms \nthat experience complexity in terms of high levels of demand and input \nheterogeneity, place great value on modular organization forms. That is, firms \nneed internal structural divergence in order to work with growing variations in \nstrategic opportunities and industry sub environments (Malnight, 2001). The \nstructural fluidity reflected by these modular forms emphasises the importance \nof social capital and diverse relationships as a significant process for mobilising \ncoherent activity rather than merely hierarchical position (Denis et al., 2001; \nButcher and Clarke, 2002). Indeed, research by Ashmos et al. (2002) suggests \nthat increasing participation in decision making increases this social \nconnectivity, which in turn gives the organization the opportunity to self-organise \nand co-evolve in more effective ways. In this way, levels of coherence are \nproduced from a plurality of interests.  \n \nNevertheless, these theories also leave considerable questions unanswered \nabout mediating coherence and plurality. For example, whilst some insight into \nthe effect of institutionalised power relationships is provided by Pettigrew (1995) \nand Child and McGrath (2001), this issue warrants further attention. For \nexample, Ashmos et al. (2002) provide little information as to exactly what form \nparticipation should take; in what way is it constrained or enabled by hierarchy? \nIn a similar vein, Levinthal and Warglien (1999) note, with some irony, that while \nideas of self-organization have captured enormous attention, practitioners and \nacademics have been left with a puzzle, how are such self-organizing systems \nto be controlled and directed? The point is reinforced by Malnight (2001) in his \nstudy of structural diversity in MNC\u2019s when he highlights that the challenge \nfacing managers in such complex organizations is how to develop and integrate \nthese multiple networks. Furthermore, what might be the motivation of individual \nmanagers to work in this way? Brown and Eisenhardt (1997), in highlighting the \nrole of \u2018semi structures\u2019 in complex environments that help create a balance \nbetween chaos and inertia, focus on the motives of autonomy, choice and an \n 23\nopportunity for improvisation. However, there is no rigorous framework that \nseeks to map out the cognitions of managers working in these ways. Thus \nDenis et al. stress that \u201cthe question of how pluralistic organizations develop \nenough coherence among their parts to allow deliberate strategic change \nremains unanswered\u201d (2001:809). \n \n2.3 The disjuncture between organizational theory and practice \n \nThe difficulty in addressing this question is a reflection of a substantial \ndisjuncture between the theory and practice of organization design. This is \napparent in two quite different ways. Firstly, for some organizations there is a \nlag between the rapid development of new organization forms in practice and \nthe capacity of existing perspectives to account for them in theory (Child and \nMcGrath, 2001). Secondly, I suggest, probably for the majority of organizations, \nthere is a gap between much of the theorising about how organizations should \nbe and how they work in practice (Butcher and Clarke, 2002; Brunson, 2002). \nDespite the increasing plurality of the workplace noted by commentators such \nas Gratton and Ghoshal (2003) and Cloke and Goldsmith (2002), in practice, \nthe organizing principles (outlined in 2.1) required to effect this theorising \nremain in their infancy (Heller, 1998; Manville and Ober, 2003) and \norganizational democracy limited (Rousseau and Rivero, 2003). One \nexplanation for this state of affairs is that the emerging managerial logic of self \norganization and its concomitant requirements for community and distributed \npower appear to be fundamentally at odds with the existing dominant \nbureaucratic and unitary model of organizational management (Child and \nMcGrath 2001; Thompson and Davidson 1995).  \n \nThis unitary model has been described as a \u2018rational mindset\u2019 (Butcher and \nAtkinson, 2001) or \u2018rational myth\u2019 (Czarniawska, 2003). This type of mental \nmodel or schema is developed through experience of the wider institutions of \norganizational and social life and acts as a deep influence on action (Giddens, \n1984). In this dominant rational mindset, priority is given to the enactment of a \nhierarchy that reflects technical and economic values, power focussed at the \ncorporate centre, top down decision making and organizational structures and \nsystems that encourage unitary working (Butcher and Atkinson, 2001; Cludts, \n1999; Brunson, 2002).  \n \nSuch is the influence of this mindset, that attempts to empower employees and \nto create less authoritarian organization cultures only tend to reinforce levels of \nnormative control and unitary approaches to managing (Cludts, 1999; Willmott, \n1993; Robertson and Swan, 2003). This has the effect of creating a gap \nbetween the rhetoric of employee participation and the reality of organizational \ncontrol (Legge, 1995). In turn, this encourages cynicism (Dean et al., 1998) and \na calculative approach to participation (Cludts, 1999). The pre-eminence of this \nschema also has the effect of diminishing the legitimacy of alternative models of \norganizing and thus the opportunity for radically reframing the role of \nparticipation and its role in hierarchy remains under-explored by senior \nmanagers (Cludts, 1999). Therefore, not only is there a substantial lacuna in \n 24\norganizational theory as to how executives should seek to \u2018reconceptualise the \nrole of bureaucracy\u2019 as Adler (1999) describes, but this gap is exacerbated by a \nmanagerial mindset that actively \u2018rationalises\u2019 attempts to address the issue.  \n \n2.4 The Priority for New Theory \nBased on this review, I argue that any new theory of hierarchy that seeks to \naddress the increasing plurality of organizational life must be comprehensive \nenough to make good the shortfalls identified in the existing discourses we have \ndiscussed. I believe that there are at least four different criteria that any such \nnew theory in this area must adequately reflect. (i) Axiomatic to the debate, is \nthe need to reflect the increasing trend toward plural organization settings \n(Denis et al., 2001) in which the need to respond to individual autonomy and \nindependence, particularly amongst critical knowledge workers and managers is \ncentral to organizational success. (ii) Any new theory must be able to surface \nthe influences of dense and interrelated social relationships and community \nnorms on participatory behaviour. Managers negotiate these relationships both \nas part of what they do and to establish what they should do (Hales, 1999) and \nthis process is therefore critical in understanding how systemic structural \ncharacteristics (Giddens, 1984) both influence and are influenced by an \nalternative conceptualisation of hierarchy. (iii) In order for such an approach to \ngain legitimacy with senior managers working with a rational mindset, any new \ntheory must be able to make strong linkages to improved organizational \nperformance if it is to have resonance with senior managers. (iv) Finally, against \na backdrop of partisan interest, new theory must also be able to explain why \nmanagers might want to adopt a different approach to hierarchy and \nparticipation. What are the interpretative schemas that managers use to make \nmeaningful, actions that apparently challenge existing conventions of \nmanagement? \n \nThe extent to which each of the five perspectives discussed here reflect these \ncriteria is discussed in section 2.2, but are summarised in figure 2. However, in \nbrief, whilst each approach provides a useful contribution to the issue of \ncoherence and plurality, there is no one approach that satisfactorily accounts for \nall four of the criteria. Stakeholder theory has given insufficient focus to the \nrequirements of employees \u2013 and other stakeholders \u2013 (Friedman and Miles, \n2002), and OCB has neglected the issue of power and politics in the \nconceptualisation of citizenship (Graham, 2000). This has also largely been an \nomission in COP theory (Fox, 2000), albeit that more recent treatments are \nseeking to redress this position. RBV often underestimates the influence of \nindividual actions and can marginalise the impact of managerial activity \n(Johnson et al., 2003). The Complexity and Co-evolutionary theories reflect well \nthe issues of social connectivity but provide insufficient insight into the \nmotivations of individual actors to work with or encourage greater levels of \nparticipation and how these cognitions are influenced by dominant power \nrelationships. Nor do any of these approaches (nor are they really intended to) \nprovide senior leaders with clear and practical principles about reconfiguring the \nrole of hierarchy \u2013 especially without resorting to unitary and rational values that \nimplicitly undermine the value of the plurality they seek to establish. \n 25\n \nFigure 2.

Voluntarism \n \nThis section firstly explains the nature of societal voluntarism and its potential as \nan organizing principle that can inform the debate on reconfiguring \norganizational hierarchy to take greater account of a plurality of organizational \ninterests. Secondly, by undertaking a comparison between the political \ninstitutional and organizational contexts for leading, organizational voluntarism \nis conceptualised in behavioural terms as form of \u2018representative\u2019 leadership. \nExamples of nascent voluntarism are described from the literature and the \npriorities for the development of new theory (see 2.4) are applied to the concept \nof organizational voluntarism. \n \nThis section reflects initial theorising about the potential of organizational \nvoluntarism contained in paper 4 (\u2018Reconciling hierarchy and democracy: the \nvalue of management learning\u2019) and the development of representative \nleadership in paper 5 (\u2018Political leadership in democracies, some lessons for \nbusiness\u2019). This approach was substantially influenced by the work undertaken \nwith David Butcher on organizational politics (paper 3 \u2018Organizational Politics, \nthe cornerstone of organization democracy?\u2019). It was as a result of this analysis \nthat the potential of voluntarism to inform the discourse on organization \ndemocracy began to take shape.  \n \n3.1 Voluntarism in Society \nIn attempting to address the central issue of how to mediate between the need \nfor organizational coherence and plurality, I have found in the arena of political \nphilosophy a parallel debate that is instructive to consider. In the political \ndiscourse surrounding the basis for a \u2018good\u2019 democratic society, the same \npolarised tension between coherence and plurality can be identified. Should \nsociety rely on the state to shape good citizens, as social conservatives would \nhave it, or should good citizens be the product of a liberal moral pluralism? \nWriters such as Etzioni (1993, 1995, and 1999), Box (1998), Verba et al. (1995) \nand Putnam (2000) promote a third, communitarian approach to tackling this \nissue that has many parallels for the debate about the role of organizational \nhierarchy. From a (particularly Etzionian) communitarian perspective, in the \ngood society the moral voice that determines the nature of good citizenship is \nthe product of a diversity of voluntary associations. These associations range \nfrom membership of local community action groups to membership of political \nparties and serve to mediate between the private world of individuals and the \nlarge institutions of society. The opportunity to selectively participate in \nassociations, free from state influence, is fundamental to the creation and \npreservation of liberty. However, most importantly, a good society is determined \nby such voluntary associations implicitly inculcating a level of self-control in their \nmembers by introducing them to particular values that reinforce individuals\u2019 \nnormative commitments to that society. In other words, it is the opportunity to \nchoose the psychological communities to which one is committed and the ability \nto cultivate a limited set of core values within a framework as free from coercion \nas possible, that is the hallmark of a mature democratic society.  \n \n 28\nWhilst I acknowledge that organizations only broadly mirror society, there are \nincreasing similarities between the two contexts to justify the value of a theory of \nsocial participation in an organizational setting (see Manville and Ober, 2003 for \none such treatment). In both organizational and political institutional settings the \nissue is the same, how best to encourage collective commitment toward \nsuperordinate goals without recourse to sanctions (Brightman and Moran, \n1999). In both settings power in increasingly distributed across different \ninstitutions, interest groups and stakeholders (Etzioni, 1998) and there is \ncontinual competition between groups for support of worthy causes (Denis et \nal., 2001; McPherson and Rotolo, 1996; Rowley and Moldoveanu, 2003). In this \ncontext, organizational leadership, like its political institutional counterpart, is \nimplicitly concerned with how to coalesce support for action whilst valuing \ndifference and conflict (Peters and Williams, 2002; Leach and Wilson, 2000, \nBarker; 1997).  \n \nOn this basis, voluntarism has the potential for illuminating organization theory \nand offers two particular benefits. Firstly, at a time of increasing concern over \nthe role of organizations in society, and the attendant consequences for \ncorporate governance and social responsibility (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, \n2001) the issue of who determines the moral voice in organizations is of \ngrowing interest (Courpasson and Dany, 2003). As democratic systems of \ngovernance ensure and protect the right to voluntary association, so \norganizational hierarchy may serve to legitimise this same principle (Coopey \nand Burgoyne, 2000; Courpasson and Dany, 2003). In doing so, such voluntary \nassociation may serve to mediate between individuals and their work \norganization in a way that enables participation in the establishment of \norganizational values and which builds commitment to the establishment of \nmoral communities (d\u2019Iribarne, 2003; Courpasson and Dany, 2003). Secondly, \nthe application of voluntarism in a pluralistic organization setting may provide an \nalternative conception of hierarchy inasmuch as voluntarism encourages a level \nof democratic self-organization that can facilitate organizational coherence \nirrespective of bureaucratic order. This self-organization is increasingly viewed \nas critical for encouraging the necessary levels of innovation and continual \nreconfiguration of strategic capabilities necessary for sustained competitive \nadvantage in dynamic markets (Child and MacGrath, 2001; Rindova and Kotha, \n2001; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). This conception of organizational \ndemocracy has been criticised by Ferdinand (2004) as being idealistic and \ntaking insufficient account of institutionalised power relations. However, as this \nsection will demonstrate, voluntarism directly reflects the centrality of social \nrelationships, community and power in the structuration of action and thus \nprovides a basis for understanding how institutional power distributions both \ninfluence and are influenced by the enactment of self-organization. \n \n3.2 Organizational Voluntarism \n \nAt this point in time, when set against the dominance of the rational mindset and \nthe illegitimacy of alternative approaches, voluntaristic behaviour in \norganizations can be best understood as an expression of individual agency. \n 29\nOver time, its wider adoption as a managerial approach to assist in balancing \nplurality and efficiency will depend upon its legitimisation as a useful organizing \nprinciple. For example, it is likely that such an approach may be viewed as \nparticularly valuable in an environment where complexity and change are \ndominant features, as in hi-tech industries. It is important to note however, that \nhierarchy and plurality, and diversity and efficiency are seen as being in \ncontinual tension in all organizational settings; they are at one level dialectically \nopposed, and at another, both essential aspects of organizing (Brunson, 2002). \nIn mature societies, once levels of democracy have been attained, the focus for \npolitical discourse is one of expressing preferences about its enactment. \nSimilarly, once a basic level of organization involvement has been attained \n(briefings, development discussions, involvement in change, cross-functional \nworking and so on) the focus for political discourse is also one of expressing \npreferences, in this case preferences very much concerned with the principles \nof voluntarism such as levels of autonomy, decentralisation, debate and access \nto information. I do not suggest therefore that voluntarism will resolve this \ntension in plurality and coherence, but instead that it provides a \u201crelational \nsynthesis\u201d (Clegg, 2003:378) of both in which progress toward more democratic \norganizational forms may be made by going beyond the notion that more of one \nnecessitates less of the other. On this basis, degrees of voluntarism are likely to \nbe considered valuable in many settings, not just those where it is legitimate to \nhold competing conceptions about organizational purpose. \n \nIn this context organizational voluntarism is defined as a stage of organizational \nevolution, or a marker of pluralistic organizational form in which managers \nrecognise the need to engage in debate and action to pursue matters of \nindividual and organization concern irrespective of hierarchical position or \nexplicit authority. This definition is premised on the idea that unofficially \nconstituted groups in organizational settings are able to provide the level of self-\ncontrol necessary for the maintenance of organizational congruence (Ashmos et \nal., 2002); a multiplicity of stakeholder agendas does not necessarily create \norganizational incoherence (Rowley and Moldoveanu, 2003; Thietart and \nForgues, 1997). Further, that these groups are more likely to do so when they \ncan express voice and contest views about which organization values are \nimportant to them (Cludts, 1999; Rousseau and Shperling, 2003) without the \nintervention of formal authority. As with voluntary associations, such \norganizational arrangements would bring people together to pursue interests \nthrough collective action, serve to distribute power, and mediate between \nindividuals and the organization, thereby creating a sense of involvement \n(Cabrera and Cabrera, 2002). It is in the nature of voluntarism that some groups \nmay be focussed on issues of critical organizational concern, others may be \nmore parochial in outlook. Crucially however, they would collectively and \nvoluntarily facilitate the flow of information between different groups (Brown and \nDuguid, 1991) and the organizational connectivity required to stimulate \ninnovation (Ashmos et al., 2002).  \n \nThe concepts of voluntarism and communitarianism are not without their \ndetractors. For example, from a liberal viewpoint, Steiner (1999) sees an \n 30\nincompatibility between the \u201cendorsement of a plurality of legitimate value \nrankings and its rejection of any uniquely valid set of fundamental moral \nstandards\u201d (1999:109). However, in pursuing interpretivist ontology we can view \ncontemporary organizations as places where managers are exposed to a \nmultiplicity of conflicting human values and ethical principles. This can create an \n\u2018ethically irrational\u2019 social world (Watson citing Weber, 2003) in which managers \nare not able to access a single set of moral principles to solve their moral \ndilemmas. Nevertheless, individual managers \u201cfaced with the ethical challenges \narising from having to deal with the ethical ambiguity of the social world\u2026.will \nnecessarily become a moral actor in their job\u201d (Watson 2003:173). \n \nUndervaluing such individuality has also been viewed as a criticism of \ncommunitarian thinking, but most recently, Etzioni (whose \u2018brand\u2019 of \ncommunitarian thinking is mostly followed here) stresses the need to seek a \ncarefully crafted balance between both community and individualism (2005). In \na similar vein, communitarianism has also often been seen as taking insufficient \naccount of institutionalised power relationships (Reynolds, 2000; Giddens, \n1984). Critical theorists have been keen to highlight the dark side of \ncommunities that tend to imply or assume consensus at the expense of \nindividual difference (Contu and Willmott, 2003; Reynolds, 2000; Reedy; 2003). \nThus, it is important to stress here that the conception of voluntarism discussed \nin this thesis is very much concerned with the \u201cpolitics of difference\u201d (Reynolds, \n2000:71) where individual conflicts and differences are accepted as being \ninevitable and not always resolvable. This orientation is similar to the notion of \nan \u2018arena\u2019 described by Burgoyne and Jackson (1997) in the context of \nmanagement learning in which \u201cdifferences \u2018meet\u2019, are fought over and \nreconciled and reconfigured into new groupings, factions and alliances\u201d \n(1997:61).  \n \nThe difference between one system of democratic governance and another is \nthe degree of autonomy that individuals have to both deliberate and make \ndecisions (March and Olsen, 1995; Courpasson and Dany, 2003). Thus, \norganizational voluntarism redefines hierarchy as a process to encourage \nvoluntary groups and individuals to deliberate and decide upon their own \nidentity minimising regulation through institutional control. This may still take the \nform of praise, reward or support, but avoiding coercion towards unitary \npriorities, in order that these groups themselves in turn influence the \nestablishment of organizational core values. Extending the parallel with \ndemocratic governance, the role of hierarchy would also be to mediate between \ndeserving causes, challenging constituents to justify the significance of their \nagendas and their demands for resource. The role of top management would \nremain to provide fundamental organizational framing, but that this would take \ninto consideration different voices, and by satisfactorily justifying their \nconclusions and actions to their constituents. In this way, voluntarism can be \nviewed as a synthesis of both a \u2018managed\u2019 and a non coercive process of \nparticipation. \n \n 31\nAs with a COP perspective, organizations therefore come to reflect a collection \nof diverse communities that are composed of both voluntary and non voluntary \nassociations (such as class, gender, race and age) and thus individuals \ninevitably become members of multiple communities. As I shall explore in \nsection 4, this highlights the possibility for individuals to pursue multiple identity \nprojects linked to the membership of different collectivities (Reedy, 2003; \nHandley et al., 2006).  \n \nHowever, in summary, it is important to stress that I do not believe voluntarism \nwill be considered universally beneficial to all, in all circumstances. For \nexample, might not a positive orientation to plurality be counter-productive from \na corporate centre perspective where business leaders might be more focussed \non shareholder return or quick turnarounds? Certainly, the answer for some \nactors may well be \u2018yes\u2019. However, what is considered counter-productive and \nby whom, is itself subject to negotiation. Thus at one extreme voluntarism may \nreflect highly covert behaviour, merely small pockets of activity, or sporadic \n\u2018irreverent\u2019 action. In the middle ground it might constitute both illegitimate \nactivity; and limited legitimate behaviour - such as local value setting, town hall \ndebates on key issues or annual plan negotiations. At the other extreme, \nvoluntarism becomes embedded as a way of working where employees are \ngiven many formal opportunities to negotiate and debate organizational values \nand voluntaristic behaviour encouraged through formal development processes. \nThe recursive nature of voluntarism is such that the degree of voluntaristic \nworking which might come to be considered as appropriate will itself be the \noutcome of voluntaristic processes; it cannot be forced on an unwilling \norganization and, given the political nature of organizations, neither can it be \neasily suppressed. \n \n3.3 Voluntaristic Leadership  \n \nIn practice then, what does this voluntaristic approach mean for business \nleaders faced with the task of mediating the need for strategic coherence and \nthe need to be responsive to organizational plurality? In seeking to understand \nhow to conceptualise voluntaristic leadership in an organizational context, my \nwork has been further informed by the parallel between institutional and \norganizational governance. The leadership of political institutions provides an \nobvious yet surprisingly under-explored starting point for understanding the \norientation required for working with a plurality of interests. This view has \nrecently been supported by John Hendry who views the traditions of responsible \npolitical leadership and governance as ideal for enabling managers to develop \nan identity that \u201cempowers them to exercise judgement, to reconcile interests, \nand to build and lead communities of trust\u201d (2006:278). My focus on the role of \nleadership per se, as opposed to the structures and mechanisms of democracy, \nis premised on the view that governance is viewed as legitimate when it allows \npeople to exercise degrees of influence over their collective destiny and \nleadership is implicit in this endeavour (Ruscio, 2004). As Ruscio confirms from \na liberal political institutional standpoint, \u201cit is impossible to imagine a strong \nhealthy democracy without leaders\u201d (2004:ix). \n 32\n \nNotwithstanding the centrality of this argument, the question of whether \ngovernance of democratic institutions can provide a legitimate and credible \ntemplate for business leaders requires further justification. Although there are \nmany different conceptions of democracy (Dahl, 1998; Lijphart, 1984; Held, \n1987; March and Olsen, 1995; Kaiser et al., 2002), and its enactment differs \nacross cultures (Kim et al., 2002), time (Skowronek, 1993) and regimes \n(Wildavski, 1989; John and Cole, 1999), at the heart of the democratic ideal lies \nthe notion of equal freedom for all to deliberate the aims of society. Our \nunderstanding of how this works in practice in Western democracies is \ndominated by our experience of modern representative democracy. However, \nrepresentative democracy is mostly linked to the governance of nations (Dahl, \n1998) rather than organizations.  \n \nThus, at face value, the validity of political institutional leadership as a basis for \nconsidering organizational leadership appears dubious. As many commentators \nnote, there are significant distinctions between institutional and organizational \ncontexts (Armbruster and Gebert, 2002; Peters and Williams, 2002; Etzioni, \n1998; Kerr, 2004). Organizations do not reflect the structural characteristics of \nmodern democracies; representation, accountability and inclusion (participation) \nare not intrinsic to the governance of work organizations. Yet it is arguable from \nan interpretivist  perspective that the enactment of these structures in \ndemocracies also lacks empirical validity. For example, representation does not \nprovide a direct and actionable link with the electorate (M\u00fcller and Str\u00f8m, 1999). \nRepresentatives are caught between party, constitutional and individual \ninterests and thus in reality politicians experience a range of influences that \nmediate their representational role.  \n \nSimilar issues arise with accountability and inclusion when the rationality \nunderlying their enactment is examined from an interpretivist perspective. \nStuckey (1999) points out that accountability is an unreliable mechanism at \nbest, as elections are becoming ever more subject to media influence, and the \ndistinctions between governing and campaigning becoming more blurred. This \n\u2018noise\u2019 serves to weaken the processes of direct accountability. Inclusion of the \nelectorate\u2019s views is similarly mediated by a number of factors. Policy decisions \nmay not reflect electoral preferences for reasons such as tactical and strategic \ndecisions by politicians, self interested behaviour, context changes, \ncompromises and broken promises (Kaiser et al,, 2002; Preston and \u2018tHart, \n1999). The electoral system, too, may impair this process. For example, in \u2018first \npast the post\u2019 systems, the winning party may not enjoy genuinely wide support, \nas evidenced in the UK by New Labour\u2019s 2001 re-election. Again, when \npoliticians are required to vote in accordance with party executive policy, \u201cat the \nlimit, democracy can mask rule by a small elite or even an elected dictator\u201d \n(Nagel cited in Kaiser et al, 2002:313).  \n \nPolitical Institutional Leadership \nThus, from an interpretivist perspective, the mechanisms of democracy are not \nrationally enacted and do not necessarily enrich or preclude a comparison with \n 33\nan organizational setting. In order to understand better the process of \ninstitutional leadership, I have found it more instructive to examine the value \npremises underlying these structures. If the democratic ideal rests on the notion \nof equal freedom for all to deliberate the aims of society, the value premises that \nunderpin this ideal embrace, are threefold. Firstly, democracy is designed to \nrealise the desire of individuals for meaningful control over their lives (Patten, \n2001; Held, 1987; Starrat, 2001). Secondly, as a consequence of the desire for \nindividual autonomy, competing interests, conflict and competition for scarce \nresources are also central to the enactment of democracy (Barry, 2002; M\u00fcller \nand Str\u00f8m 1999; Jones, 1989). Lastly, reasoned debate over alternatives is an \nintegral and essential value for the resolution of these differences (Held, 1987; \nStuckey, 1999). \n \nFrom a pan historical viewpoint, the stewardship of these value premises has \nbecome central to the role of democratic government. Thus over time, societies \nhave enshrined them in roles, rules and procedures that provide the practical \nframeworks for the mechanisms of representation, inclusion and accountability. \nIt is therefore the interaction and application of these roles, rules and \nprocedures that, for practical purposes, forms the context for political leadership \n(Elgie, 1995; March and Olsen, 1995). In this context, studies of political \nleadership have explored the impact of a wide variety of influences such as \nstyle (Simonton, 1988), psychological disposition (Preston and \u2018tHart, 1999), \nand in different settings such as party leadership (M\u00fcller and Str\u00f8m, 1999), \nlobbying (DeGregorio, 1997), local authorities (Leach and Wilson, 2000), and \nthe public sector organizations (Vigoda, 2002).  \n \nHowever, this work indicates that generic issues are recognisable across \ndifferent democratic systems (Elgie, 1995), and therefore that similar types of \nleadership behaviour are observable. Here, too, an interpretivist orientation \nproves instructive (Jones, 1989; Starrat, 2001). Specifically, it suggests that in \nstewarding the value premises of democracy, the enactment of institutional \nleadership is characterised by the need to resolve two distinct sources of stress: \nfirstly, between the drive for cohesion and the productive exploitation of \ndifferences; secondly, between the exercise of bureaucratic politics and civic \nvirtue. In effect, the manner in which leaders address these tensions amounts to \nprocesses-in-use that are in practice the mechanisms for enacting democratic \nvalue premises. Thus the mechanisms of representation, accountability and \ninclusion provide a formal expression of what, in actuality, are elaborate social \nprocesses.  \n \nPolitical institutional leadership is thus characterised by a continual process of \nsecuring cohesion amongst inevitably diverse interest groups, lobbies and \nelectorates (Leach and Wilson, 2000). Yet these differences are also often seen \nas a healthy stimulus that can make a positive contribution. In order to maintain \nenthusiasm amongst immediate followers, leaders need to be able to encourage \nsuch differences (Leach and Wilson, 2000). Approaches to managing this \ndiversity in cabinet settings include developing relationships with key factions, \nencouraging interdependence and empowerment amongst cabinet colleagues, \n 34\npreparing the ground before meetings, and rewarding allies (Kaarbo and \nHerman, 1998).  \n \nThis tension between the drive for cohesion and the productive exploitation of \ndifferences also serves to emphasise the pervasive existence of micro politics in \nthe leadership process. Actors with mutual and competing interests are \ncontinually bargaining, coalition building, pulling and hauling (DeGregorio, 1997; \nHeld, 1987; Preston and \u2018tHart, 1999). Such activity can of course be \ndestructive (Nice 1998), but is nevertheless endemic to leadership in an \ninstitutional context and a potentially valuable source of pluralist checks and \nbalances (Preston and \u2018tHart, 1999). However, such behaviour can only be \npredicated on the assumption that political leaders possess \u201ccivic virtue\u201d \n(Starrat, 2001:337), the ability to forego, at least on some occasions, self \ninterest on behalf of others or on behalf a wider common good. For without civic \nvirtue, democracy disintegrates (Renshon, 2000). As Steve Patten points out, \n\u201cone of the goals of [deliberative] democracy is to move beyond purely self-\ninterested adversarialism\u201d (2001:224). If successful political leaders are those \nwho are able to create cohesion from diversity, such leaders must demonstrate \ntheir ability to balance self interested behaviour with broader policy goals. \n \nWhilst not attempting to suggest that political institutional leadership might \nmirror all aspects of its business counterpart, I argue that this perspective offers \na basis from which to consider how managers might work more effectively with \ncomplex and varied competing interests. If, the modern corporation is also \nincreasingly characterised by similar tensions (Peele, 2005; Pfeffer, 1992; \nRousseau and Rivero, 2003), an appreciation of how to manage the conflicts \nbetween cohesion and productive differences, and between self-interest and \n\u2018civic virtue,\u2019 potentially offers a useful parallel to consider. \n \nRepresentative Leadership in Organizations \nAs previously highlighted, there are clearly inherent limits to which \nrepresentation, accountability and inclusion are appropriate to the business \ncontext. Despite the increasing interest in stakeholder theory, the idea of \nbusiness leaders representing the interests of a constituency, other than that of \nshareholder, seems as yet embryonic (Cragg, 2000). Furthermore, insofar as \nthe faithful representation of constituent interests is apparent in business, \naccountablity is not subject to the same high degree of public scrutiny required \nof political leaders. Similarly, the inclusion of constituent views in business \ndecision making processes remains limited, despite significant and widespread \neffort to introduce formal participatory mechanisms (Thompson and Davidson, \n1995; Heller, 1998). And most fundamentally, whilst protecting the rights of \ndemocratic participation is an immutable aspect of political leadership, it is not \nreflected in a business context (Coopey and Burgoyne, 2000). The stewardship \nrole of business leaders has become institutionalised as a concern for \norganizational wealth and shareholder return, rather than democratic principles \nof governance (Cragg, 2000).  \n \n 35\nHowever, these are mostly differences of degree rather than substance. Thus, \non the one hand, political leaders within the institutions of democracy make \nconsiderable use of formal authority in such roles as party officials or committee \nmembers. Political parties and the executive institutions of government are \norganizations with hierarchies, and formal authority has a role in enabling \npolitical leaders to create coherence. Yet such formal authority must be \nbalanced fundamentally with the legitimacy of representation and accountability \nfor the inclusion of pluralist electorate views. On the other hand, from a \nstakeholder theory perspective, the formal authority of business leaders co-\nexists with their role as de facto representatives of constituent interests. As \norganizations become more complex and fragmented, the role of informal power \nderived from relationships and networks across the organization increases in \nimportance (Atkinson and Butcher, 2003; Tsai and Ghoshal,1998) and \nleadership thus becomes evermore the product of an informal social process \n(Barker, 1997; Ray et al., 2004; Bennett et al., 2003). The appointment of \nleaders to senior positions is therefore dependent upon representing the \ninterests of a whole range of relationships, which if not recognised can lead to \npolitical turnover (Denis et al., 2001; Comtois et al., 2004; Grit, 2004). Business \nleaders are therefore required to become representative in their approach, a \nprocess further reinforced by increasing public scrutiny of corporate affairs.  \n \nAs it is for political leaders in democratic institutions, this requirement both to \ncoalesce and distribute power can only be achieved on the assumption that the \nleadership of organizations is intrinsically a micro-political process. Since there \nis ample evidence that this is the case (Pfeffer, 1992; Barker, 1997; Coopey and \nBurgoyne, 2000; Butcher and Clarke, 2002), it follows that business leaders \nneed to and, indeed, appear to embrace behaviours that not only include \ndebate, lobbying and coalition building, but also more contentious activities such \nas information management, covert action and an ability to \u201ctrick, woo and \ncajole support\u201d (DeGregorio, 1997:2). In other words, if some level of cohesion \naround core organizational values is to be achieved, these behaviours need to \nbecome as integral to business leadership as open dialogue and debate about \ndifferences. As has increasingly been recognised (Pfeffer, 1992; Buchanan, \n1999; Vigoda, 2003), micro-political behaviour in organizations, far from being \ndysfunctional, is central to the achievement of managerial goals. Moreover, it \nmay well constitute a vehicle to strengthen the social responsibility of managers \n(Grit, 2004).   \n \nIn this respect, the negative connotation associated with \u2018organizational politics\u2019 \nis a residue of rational bureaucratic values and an impediment to effective \nmanagement of the stakeholder organization. In this thesis, political capital is \nviewed more as a democratic asset (Novicevic and Harvey, 2004; Butcher and \nClarke, 2002; Coopey and Burgoyne, 2000) which reflects the varying capacity \nof individuals to influence the way they are governed. Coopey and Burgoyne \n(2000) also argue that the legitimacy of political action may be accelerated \nthrough statutory rights that guarantee participation in debate, freedom of \nspeech and protection from illegal coercion. However, as Heller (1998) \nobserves, over the last 50 years the many attempts to introduce greater levels \n 36\nof democracy into the workplace have met with limited success, and formal \nparticipation in decision making can be slow and messy, leading to unwarranted \nlevels of conflict (Duchon et al. 1998, cited in Ashmos et al., 2002). And as \nStuckey (1999) highlights in the context of political institutions, tightening formal \naccountability may only force leaders to resort to less acceptable means of \nmicro-political behaviour. As with the leadership of political institutions, \nresponsible micro-political behaviour can only be predicated on the assumption \nthat business leaders possess civic virtue. There is no evidence to suggest that \nmanagers are any less motivated by just causes, any less willing to forego self-\nserving ends, or any less prepared to distinguish between ethical and unethical \nmeans, than elected politicians (Michalos, 2001). \n \nThus in summary, this comparison between institutional and organizational \nleadership highlights the way in which individual leadership is central to the \ndevelopment of democratic governance in both contexts; formal processes are \nsimply insufficient to guarantee its enactment. Whilst the fear of leadership \npower being used for coercion will always be in tension with democratic \nprinciples, leadership is central to the democratic process in which individuals \nexercise influence over their collective autonomy (Ruscio, 2004). Furthermore, I \nargue that in work settings where organizing is dominated by a unitary and \nbureaucratic mindset, progress may best be made by such leadership action. \nThe coherence of action offered by unitarism will always be in conflict with \npressure for local autonomy and, as in political institutions, balancing the needs \nof both is a process of political leadership (Patten, 2001; Ruscio, 2004). In both \nwork and institutional contexts, leadership is central to the effective governance \nof local communities (John and Cole, 1999; Galunic and Eisenhardt, 2001; \nCaldart and Ricart, 2004). \n \nOn this basis, Representative Leadership (RL) behaviour is seen as the product \nof a voluntaristic mindset in which managers recognise the need to engage in \ndebate and action to represent matters of individual and organization concern \nirrespective of hierarchical position or explicit authority. Notwithstanding the \nanalysis of representative democracy above, the term \u2018representative\u2019 \nleadership is used here primarily to emphasise the micro-political dimension of \nthis behaviour rather than a formal process of representation. In reality, the \nbehaviour described is more akin to principles of participative democracy, that \nis, encouraging difference, voice, self-organization and decision making (Patten, \n2001), than to those of formal representation. As in civic and public affairs, \nthese discursive practices are predicated on the basis that they help to form \nlocal identities and influence organizational values. \n \n3.4 Organization voluntarism as emerging practice \n \nAt this stage, this view of voluntarism and RL represents an exploratory \ncontribution to theory (Boisot and Child, 1999), but one that reflects emerging \norganizational practice in pluralist organizational settings, and for that reason \nalone warrants further academic attention. For example, a recent co-\nevolutionary study by Galunic and Eisenhardt (2001) reveals how senior \n 37\nmanagers have crafted an organizational form where diversity and autonomy of \naction is greatly encouraged, but an appropriate degree of alignment is still \nachieved. This culture and architecture are the result of a decentralised and \nself-organized behaviour. Business units are free to shape their own portfolios, \nincluding the warrant to contest other divisions for control of different products \nand markets. In response, senior managers reward winners and good \n\u2018corporate citizenship\u2019 but also help losers to improve. Most importantly, such \ndecisions are guided by social considerations about fairness as well as \neconomic imperatives for profit and growth. However, in this study, as with \nmuch of the discourse on co-evolution, the role of power remains under-\nexplored. \n \nIn contrast, Denis et al. (2001), in their study of leadership and strategic change \nin the pluralistic setting of hospital administration, note, in line with our \nobservations of voluntarism, how leadership is necessarily a political process. In \na situation where power is diffuse and objectives divergent, levels of coherence \nare achieved by constellations of leaders who are sensitive to the needs of \ndifferent constituencies in order to gain credibility and support. Constructive \npolitical activity, in terms of compromise, lobbying, alliances and collaborative \nsolutions are central to how support is mobilised. In particular, Denis et al. note \nthe role of \u201ccreative individuals and committed unified groups in proactively \nmoving to make change happen\u201d (2001:834) in situations where the legitimacy \nof change initiatives cannot be taken for granted. Complementary research by \nComtois et al. (2004) also highlights the role of politics in the process of health \ncare innovation. The same conclusions about the centrality of power and politics \nin voluntaristic activity are reached by Clarke and Meldrum (1999) and Clarke et \nal., (2002) in their studies of bottom up change. Lipman-Blumen and Leavitt\u2019s \n(1999) exploration of \u2018hot groups\u2019 reflects similar aspects of unofficial behaviour.  \n \nEvidence of the way in which such communities can stimulate change and \ninnovation is provided by Swan et al. (2002) who demonstrate how radical \ninnovation in the health care sector was achieved against a backdrop of diverse \nprofessional interests and uneven power relations. Coherence in approach was \nachieved through a discursive strategy, reflective of Reynolds \u201cpolitics of \ndifference\u201d (2000:71), that sought to align the competing interests and agendas \nin the innovation process through the rhetoric of community and engagement \nwith the diverse interests that constituted that community. Also, similar to the \nGalunic and Eisenhardt case, the management team were able to balance \ncommercial interests with the broader values of other groups by sublimating \npurely economic considerations in the cause of community building. Research \nby Ashmos et al. (2002) suggests that this type of engagement helps to \ngenerate multiple perspectives of the environment. In turn, this alters an \norganization\u2019s predisposition to new challenges and opportunities, thus \nstimulating innovation and continual adaptation. Similar conclusions are \nreached by Ravasi and Verona (2001) and Foss (2003) in their analyses of the \nDanish company Oticon. In Oticon, innovation is sustained by structural \nambiguity and voluntary project initiatives, and strategic coherence the product \nof continual negotiation amongst a plurality of coordinating groups and roles. \n 38\nColbert (2004) provides thirteen HRM principles, in use today, which can be \nused to nurture such innovation by balancing both coherence and complexity. \nThese include tolerating multiple aims, embracing debate, and creating space \nfor experimentation.  \n \nMy own research (Clarke, 2006, - explored in detail in the next section) with 31 \nmanagers in five organizations characterised by varying attitudes towards \nplurality is also supportive of the notion of organizational voluntarism and RL. \nThe research identified a range of individual approaches to working with \nplurality of interests. These behaviours are represented on a continuum ranging \nfrom \u2018rational\u2019 to \u2018representative\u2019 (see figure 3). At one end, leadership \nbehaviour reflects the use of formal processes such as meetings and senior \nmanagement presentations to position causes and influence colleagues. This \nwas also characterised by a tendency to limit debate and challenge to a small \ncoterie of senior managers and to prescribe delegation and empowerment \nwithin well controlled guidelines. At the other end of the range six managers \nemployed behaviours consistent with the conceptualisation of voluntarism and \nRL. These included working with individual agendas, the use of covert activity \nand representing the interests of quasi legitimate constituencies. \n \nFigure 3 Leadership Behaviours \nFrom (Rational Leadership) To (Representative Leadership) \nPreference for formal meetings \nand processes \n \nFocus on senior management \napproval\/buy-in \nRelationship building focussed at \nsenior levels \nDebating and challenging amongst \nsmall coterie \nCarefully prescribed delegation \nand empowerment \n \nTendency to influence through \noperational control \nWorking on formally agreed \npriorities\/issues \n \nChallenging through established \nprocesses \nExclusive and Involving of few \nRepresenting legitimate \norganization interests e.g. own \ndepartment, customers \n \n \nExtensive use of informal \nprocesses, e.g. covert activity, corridor \nmeetings \nFocus on working with personal \nagendas \nRelationship building and \nnetworking at all levels \nEncouraging debate and challenge \nat all levels \nProviding others with space and \nautonomy to experiment, stimulating \nbottom up change \nInfluencing by focussing on broad \ndirection \nWorking outside of agreed \nresponsibilities, often on unofficial \ninitiatives \nChallenging the status quo, \nirreverent and subversive \nInclusive and involving of many \nRepresenting the interests of quasi \nlegitimate constituencies, often external \nto own responsibilities, e.g. other \nfunctions, unofficial issues \n \n 39\n3.5 Organizational voluntarism as emerging theory \n \nHowever, notwithstanding these examples, central to this thesis is the desire to \nstimulate broader debate and theory building about the reconfiguration of \norganizational plurality and coherence. So, to what extent might the concept of \nvoluntarism make good the shortfalls in existing theory building by meeting the \nfour criteria identified in section 2; (i) the centrality of organizational plurality, (ii) \nthe embeddedness of social relations and power in organizational working, (iii) \naccounting for the motivations of managers to pursue actions in contravention of \ntraditional approaches, and (iv) the need for clear organizational benefits?  \n \n(i) Firstly, at a time when organization plurality is only likely to increase (Denis et \nal. 2001), the concept of voluntarism clearly assumes the inevitability and value \nof plurality, greater autonomy and choice as being central to organizational \nsuccess. Diversity of interest and autonomy of individual action are \nprerequisites for voluntarism. Reflecting as they do, broader changes in society, \nultimately, these factors may well be the most significant drivers for the adoption \nof voluntaristic principles. In this way I view voluntarism as a natural stage in the \nevolution of organizational form.  \n \n(ii) Voluntarism directly reflects the centrality of social relationships, community \nand power in the structuration of action and thus provides a basis for \nunderstanding how institutional power distributions both influence and are \ninfluenced by the enactment of these voluntaristic principles. The centrality of \npower reflected in the dualism of hierarchy and participation, competition and \ncollaboration, local autonomy and strategic coherence, embodies the \nstructuration of resources, and cognitive and moral rules upon which managers \ndraw that both constrain and enable what they do (Hales, 1999; Giddens, 1984). \nWith organizational voluntarism, power and its negotiation through political \ndiscourse is positioned as an explicit leadership activity; \u201cpower is the means of \ngetting things done\u201d (Giddens, 1984:283). For example, Denis et al. (2001) \nhighlight how leaders in pluralistic settings mobilise a range of symbolic and \nmaterial resources to create influence and \u201cstrategic couplings\u201d which include; \naligning with widely held perceptions about organizational issues and \nenvironmental constraints, the use of positional authority, secrecy, leveraging \nthe credibility of acknowledged performance, maintaining appropriateness of \nbehaviour in the eyes of significant support groups etc. Through such practices, \nover time, managers are able to constitute and reconstitute what they do and \nwho they are as contextual forces evolve (Denis et al., 2001).  \n \n(iii) The third criterion by which new theory must be judged is that of providing \nstrong linkages to improved organizational performance, for without which there \nis little incentive for senior management to adopt such principles. In this regard, \nwe see the idea of voluntarism fitting well within the co-evolutionary discourse in \nwhich the need for organizational flexibility and the continual reconfiguration of \nstrategic capabilities is viewed as critical to sustainable competitive advantage \nin dynamic environments (Galunic and Eisenhardt, 2001; Rindova and Kotha, \n2001). The concept of voluntarism and its themes of local autonomy and \n 40\ndiversity reflect well emerging views as to the importance of self-organization in \nallowing for a dynamic feedback between the organization and its environment \nin order to co-evolve (Lewin and Volberda, 1999; Ashmos et al, 2002). The self-\norganization inherent within the voluntaristic form clearly facilitates the process \nof rapid reconfiguration to respond to different market circumstances (Galunic \nand Eisenhardt, 2001; Child and McGrath, 2001; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). \nPerhaps, most acutely for senior managers, the concept of voluntarism also \nprovides a framework for capitalising on diversity in the pursuit of innovation. \nLocal communities, being at the interface of the organization and its \nenvironment are seen to be a rich source of innovation (Brown and Duguid, \n1991, 2001). Scarborough et al. (2004) note how local autonomy in project \ngroups can help to overcome the barriers to the flow and transfer of knowledge. \nIn their study this knowledge integration was exemplified by developing local \nrules, openness and greater exchange of information. More fundamentally, \nresearch by Ashmos et al. (2002) and Ravasi and Verona (2001) highlight how \nparticipation helps to generate multiple perspectives which in turn alters an \norganization\u2019s predisposition to new challenges and opportunities and thus \npotentially stimulates innovation. In effect, these ideas reflect further schemas \nabout the structural characteristics of institutions that will serve to legitimate \nvoluntarism in the eyes of senior management.  \n \nHowever, above all else, I believe that the concept of voluntarism potentially \nprovides senior managers with a model for merging hierarchical structure with \ngreater egalitarian practice. Whilst cooperation declines as organization size \nincreases, voluntary group discussion in value setting leads to increased \ncommitment (Cludts, 1999) and contribution (Cabrera and Cabrera, 2002). Such \ncommunication also enhances group identity and personal responsibility, which \nare powerful mechanisms of self-control (Cabrera and Cabrera, 2002; Cludts, \n1999). Indeed, paradoxically, managers are seen to enhance their authority by \nparticipating in this debate (Cludts, 1999). By acknowledging the tension \nbetween, for example, the seemingly contradictory relationships of hierarchy \nand participation, or local autonomy and strategic coherence, the resulting \n\u2018organized dissonance\u2019; - the \u201cstrategic union of forms presumed to be hostile\u201d - \ncan produce critical levels of organizational resonance (Ashcraft, 2001:1304). \nIndeed, voluntarism may come to be considered as one of the few simple but \noften contradictory rules (Galunic and Eisenhardt, 2001) that are believed to \nguide the development of successful co-evolution.  \n \n(iv) Finally, of particular significance to the concept of voluntarism is the \nquestion as to why individuals might wish to engage with ideas that, at least in \nthe short term, are at odds with the dominant rational approach to organising. \nWhat are the interpretive schemata (Hales, 1999; Giddens, 1984) that \nmanager\u2019s draw upon to make their work meaningful in pluralistic settings? This \nquestion reflects the fourth criterion by which new theory might be evaluated \nand has been the subject of a substantial research project and is discussed in \ndetail in the next section. \n \n \n 41\n \n4. The Voluntaristic Mindset: Representative Leadership \n \nThis section explores the antecedents of RL behaviour and details an empirical \nstudy designed for this purpose. This study is reported in paper 7; \u2018A study of \nrepresentative leadership in stimulating organization democracy\u2019. The section \nconcludes by drawing together the different strands of the research into a \nconceptual framework for organizational voluntarism. \n \nInitial theorising about the possible motivations to work from a voluntaristic \nperspective suggested that my research could be usefully informed by the \ndiscourse on identity and work meanings (Alvesson and Willmott, 2002; \nWrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001; Robertson and Swan, 2003; Knights and \nMcCabe, 2003; Ford and Harding, 2003). From this perspective all managers \nare continuously engaged in forming and repairing a sense of self-identity that is \ncoherent and distinctive (Alvesson and Willmott, 2002; Coopey and Burgoyne, \n2000). Self-identity is thus a complex mixture of conscious and subconscious \nelements, an interpretative and reflexive grid of schemas shaped by experience \nof endless interactions with individuals and societal institutions (Alvesson and \nWillmott, 2002; Danieli and Thomas, 1999; Giddens, 1984). I argue that an \norientation towards voluntarism and RL, reflects a bundle of such schemas or \ncognitions about organizational working that enable some managers to create \nand sustain viable definitions of who they are and what they do. This process \nmay be in contravention of institutionalised definitions of self, but can still \nenhance affirmation of self (Hales, 1999; Wrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001; \nWeeks and Galunic, 2003). \n \n4.1 Conceptualising Representative Leadership \n \nThe earlier comparison between the institutional and organizational contexts \n(section 3.2) suggested that, in an environment where plurality of interest was \nevident, leadership was likely to be characterised by motivations that sought to \nwork with the tensions this plurality created; working with cohesion and \ndifference, and self-interest and civic virtue. In order to explore both the \nbehaviours and the antecedents of this behaviour in a corporate setting, an \ninitial conceptual framework for RL was developed from the literature discussed \nhere.  \n \nFour behaviour sets were hypothesised as being central to balancing diversity \nand cohesion of agenda, and self-interest and civic virtue. (1) Representing the \ninterests of constituencies not immediately connected with a leader\u2019s own \nformal responsibilities - leaders who value diversity of view are hypothesised as \nbeing concerned to bring together a wide variety of constituencies to pursue \ninterests through collective action, thereby creating a sense of involvement \n(Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2005). (2) In turn this requires leaders to provide \nsuch constituencies with space, autonomy and power to act and experiment. \nThis behaviour is premised on the idea that, in practice, the participation of \nunofficially constituted groups in organizational settings can provide the level of \n 42\nself-control necessary for the maintenance of organizational congruence \n(Ashmos et al., 2002; Caldart and Ricart, 2004). (3) In order to encourage \ncohesion, RL\u2019s need to facilitate debate and challenge. This orientation is \nsimilar to the notion of an \u2018arena\u2019 (Burgoyne and Jackson, 1997) in which \n\u201cdifferences meet, are fought over, reconciled and reconfigured into new \ngroupings factions and alliances\u201d (1997:61). (4) In practice, this means that \norganizational politics, - defined here as \u201cthose deliberate efforts made by \nindividuals or groups in organizations to use power in pursuit of their own \ninterests\u201d (Butcher and Clarke, 2001:19), - as with its counterpart in an \ninstitutional setting, is a necessary and logical process by which diverse \ninterests are resolved (Butcher and Clarke, 2002; Held, 1987). Political \nbehaviours such as networking, positioning causes, lobbying, and coalition \nbuilding (Denis et al., 2001; Ammeter et al, 2002) constitute a significant subset \nof RL behaviours. These four behaviour sets were viewed as recursive, both \nshaped by, and shaping, social structures. \n \n4.2 Researching Representative Leadership \n \nIn order to understand the influence of context\/structure on the enactment of \nsuch behaviours, five commercial organizations were selected from different \nindustries using data from publicly available sources such as annual reports and \nwebsites. The concepts of complexity absorption and complexity reduction \n(Boisot and Child, 1999) were used as a template for this selection. That is, \norganizations that reflected public statements of intent concerning levels of \ncomplexity absorption (local autonomy, diversity of strategic activity and more \ninformal and decentralised structures) were deemed to reflect a willingness to \nembrace pluralism. Organizations that reflected public statements of intent \nconcerning complexity reduction (fewer goals and strategic activities and which \ntended to formalise and centralise structures and decision making) were \nconsidered to reflect a level of intolerance toward plurality. The extent to which \nthis link between complexity, structure and plurality was actually reflected in \nmanagerial behaviour and cognition formed part of the analysis, and was used \nhere only as a theoretical starting point from which to create the organizational \nsample.  \n \nThe sample thus reflected a continuum of public responses to pluralism ranging \nfrom \u201cdemocratic ownership\u201d by a diverse array of members, to one company \ndescribing its leadership as the product of the CEO and the leadership team \noperating as one in making decisions for the \u201centire [company name] group\u201d. \nThese were as follows; a conglomerate from the co-operative movement \n(Congco), a food manufacturing business (Foodco), a building supplies \norganization (Buildco), a publishing company (Bookco), and a financial services \norganization (Finco). \n \nCase studies were selected as the most appropriate methodology as they are of \nparticular value where the theory base is comparatively weak and because they \nare particularly suited to an environment where theory building and testing are \nfeasible and where a level of triangulation is possible (Harrison, 2002). On this \n 43\nbasis, multiple case studies were selected from this sample to assess the \nvalidity of the initial conceptual framework and to generate data that would \nenable the exploration of the potential antecedents of these behaviours. Thirty-\none cases were eventually selected for interview using three criteria: firstly, that \nthey were senior managers who in theory would have the potential autonomy to \nexercise representative behaviours; secondly that they had around ten years \nservice, which, when combined with their seniority, would suggest a level of \nknowledge about how to work effectively within their organization\u2019s culture; and \nthirdly, that they were familiar with each other so as to permit a level of \ntriangulation in their reported behaviours. (Bacharach and Bamberger, 1996). \nThe resulting sample contained 7 women and 24 men of which 17 held line \nresponsibilities and 14 functional or corporate responsibilities. \n \nData were collected via semi structured interviews; questions being loosely \ndesigned around 10 broad themes (Laukkenanen, 1994), such as \u2018role\u2019, \n\u2018change\u2019, and \u2018influence\u2019. Derived from the initial conceptual framework, these \nthemes were designed to surface the constructs that each manager used to \nmake sense of and negotiate their environment. The interviews lasted between \n60 and 90 minutes: all were recorded and transcribed. In order to minimise the \ntendency for socially desirable responses, confidentiality and anonymity were \nassured (Johnson and Johnson, 2002).  \n \nThe interview was divided into two parts. The first part focussed on ascertaining \neach manager\u2019s perception about the enactment of key organizational activities \nsuch as change management and strategy development. Such issues can be \ncontentious and thus responses would be indicative of perceptions of plurality \nand political activity (Pettigrew, 1995). Intra-organizational descriptions were \nanalysed and mapped onto Boisot and Child\u2019s (1999) complexity \nreduction\/absorption model to reflect a continuum of tolerance toward plurality. \n \nThe second part focussed on surfacing how each manager went about his or \nher work within this context; what behaviour did they use to negotiate this \nenvironment? For example, questions included \u201cHow would you describe your \nrole?\u201d, \u201cTo whom do you see yourself responsible and for what?\u201d to surface \nthinking patterns about perceptions of personal autonomy. Using a laddering \ntechnique (Easterby-Smith et al, 2002), \u2018How?\u2019 questions were used to surface \nbehaviour, followed by questions such as \u201cWhat causes you to work in this \nway?\u201d or \u201cWhy?\u201d (Ambrosini and Bowman, 2002) to surface a logic of action \n(Bacharach and Bamberger, 1996; Buchanan, 1999), that is, to illuminate \nlinkages between \u201cif I do this then\u2026. X will result\u201d. The answers given in the first \nsection, which focussed on perceptions of organizational issues, also served to \nensure that the analysis of this second set of responses could be understood in \ncontext, and thus reduce any tendency to make simplistic cross case \ngeneralisations (Johnson and Johnson, 2002).  \n \nValidity was further enhanced through interviewees being encouraged to \nillustrate responses with anecdotes, as these can reveal tacit thinking and \norganizational routines not easily surfaced through other methods (Ambrosini \n 44\nand Bowman, 2002). In addition, each in-company case was constructed to \npermit a degree of triangulation of reported behaviours by other members of \nthat sample. Using these data, a portrait of each manager was constructed for \ncomparison with that manager\u2019s own description. \n \nThe data were analysed using standard practices for qualitative data described \nby Miles and Huberman (1994) (Milliken et al., 2003). Preliminary coding of \nbehaviours was undertaken using the constructs from the initial conceptual \nframework. These were refined after several iterations by emerging themes that \nwere subjected to review by others not involved in the data collection, and a list \nof significant variables created for each case. These were used as the basis for \ninitial causal \u2018cognitive\u2019 mapping. A representative selection of these maps was \nturned into short profiles that were then presented to the interviewees for \nfeedback. Comments were noted and incorporated back into the overall \nanalysis. Cross case maps were constructed using variables estimated to be \nthe most influential in accounting for the behaviour described by each manager \nand their colleagues.  \n \nThe full range of leadership behaviours identified in the research (see figure 3), \nwere related to four different \u2018cognitive clusters\u2019, albeit that within each there \nwere variations in the priority given to different types of behaviour. The clusters \nrepresent \u201capproximated displays of elements of managers\u2019 thoughts at a \nspecific point in time, noted in particular ways, in particular environments\u201d \n(Johnson and Johnson, 2002:232). These four clusters, in keeping with the \nproposition for the study, were readily differentiated by perceptions about the \nlegitimacy of organizational pluralism (see figure 4). All interviewees \nacknowledged the legitimacy of plurality in their organizations to some degree. \nHowever, this varied from an acceptance of the inevitability of plurality in which \ndifferences should be minimised, or at least heavily aligned in the interests of \norganizational effectiveness, to a view where plurality of interest was viewed as \na critical organizing principle, to be encouraged in order to enhance \norganizational effectiveness. The former view is termed \u2018bounded plurality\u2019 and \nmost closely reflects an orientation toward complexity reduction and \ncodification. The opposite end of the continuum is termed \u2018extended plurality\u2019 \nand reflects a disposition toward complexity absorption and abstraction (Boisot \nand Child, 1999). \n 45\nFigure 4.

In particular, although some level of political behaviour was \nexpected, the findings emphasise how the leaders reflecting RL behaviour often \nused covert and irreverent approaches, and worked on unofficial initiatives in \norder to promote their causes. The potential for this behaviour to be interpreted \nnegatively appeared to be minimised by a cognitive framework that legitimised \nindividual interests when balanced with other\u2019s agendas, a willingness to take \nauthority in the pursuit of these interests and a concern to be (selectively) \ntransparent about this agenda with others. In this way, individuals appeared to \nbe able to balance both the need for cohesion and diversity, and self-interest \nand civic virtue. The data were also indicative of a causal flow of cognition from \nlegitimacy of plurality to transparency of motive, albeit that these links were \nhighly recursive, emphasising their reflexive nature. But what does this tell us \nabout why individuals in corporate settings might work in this way in \ncontravention of dominant unitary definitions of managing? \n \nFrom a structuration perspective, social action is the product of both structure \nand agency (Giddens, 1984; Hales, 1999; Pozzebon, 2004) and the interaction \nof these were evident in several ways. For example, Foodco and Congco, \norganizations that reflected a long tradition of local autonomy and individual \nindependence in their cultures, employed half of the managers working with \ncognitions of extended plurality. This appears to have encouraged the unofficial \nadoption of overt political behaviours as a method of working with diverse \ninterests.  \n \nThose working with cognitions of bounded plurality were also influenced by \ncontext through institutionalised definitions of managing and leading. In these \nfirst two clusters, cognitions embodied a sense of duty to the pursuit of \ncollective goals. This \u2018obedience\u2019 was enforced by legitimate authority structures \n(Courpasson and Dany, 2003). The dissonance between the inevitability of \nindividual needs and collective outcomes was assuaged by an identity formation \nthat blurred the boundaries between manager and the organization, such that \nsome managers came to see themselves as the organization (Ford and \nHarding, 2003). The effect is that managers both control others and themselves, \nrestricting the opportunities they have for working with greater levels of \nautonomy (Ford and Harding, 2003; Hales, 1999; Alvesson and Willmott, 2002; \nRobertson and Swan, 2003).  \n \nFormal role, too, may have influenced responses, as some positions necessarily \nreflected greater scope for taking authority (Wrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001). \nNevertheless, this did not appear to be a primary determinant of behaviour. In \ntwo cases senior managers defined their roles with less discretion than their \nsubordinates. I had also anticipated that RL behaviour would be directly \ninfluenced by senior management encouragement, although no direct support \nfor this was obtained from those portraying RL behaviour. In two instances the \n 47\nsample included the direct reports of managers within the RL cluster. The \nresponses of their subordinates suggested that they were being encouraged to \nadopt RL behaviour.  \n \nRL behaviours were identified in each of the five organizations suggesting that \nagency played a more significant part in the evolution of RL cognitions. For \nexample, managers reflecting RL behaviours often interpreted their priorities \nvery differently from colleagues in the same organization. In one instance, a \nsenior manager was pursing an agenda of decentralisation and diversity, whilst \nhis colleague working from the first cognitive cluster was occupied with \ndeveloping a more homogenous and structurally aligned organization.  \n \nWhere plurality was considered most legitimate, the cognitive clusters were \ndelineated by the degree to which individuals perceived their own agendas as \nbeing interwoven with those of others. Where this did not occur, cognitions still \nreflected a priority for autonomy and taking authority, political activity, debate \nand challenge. However, these aspirations were still constrained by institutional \ninterpretations of unity. This was particularly marked in one Foodco director, \nwho was clearly committed to extending plurality through values and structures \nthat encouraged senior management ownership. Yet he felt equally strongly that \n\u201cthere can\u2019t be a load of different visions of where the group\u2019s going, you\u2019ve got \nto lead with one vision\u201d, and \u201cthey [line managers] can decide not to comply, \nthey can decide not to take the synergy that\u2019s available, they can decide to be \nparochial\u2026..\u201d where \u2018parochial\u2019 and \u2018synergy\u2019 were used in a pejorative sense to \nreflect concerns of control and unity. This orientation is suggestive of Robertson \nand Swan\u2019s (2003) notion of \u2018dependable autonomy\u2019 and Clegg and \nCourpasson\u2019s (2004) \u2018soft despotism\u2019 where identity control is exercised through \na form of enforced democracy in which managers adopt apparently independent \nbehaviours but which ultimately align with the firm. \n \nNevertheless, managers do not always accept the organizational identity \nprovided without also finding culturally legitimate ways to distance themselves \nfrom it (Weeks and Galunic, 2003; Knights and McCabe, 2003). In this way RL \nwas formed in contravention of institutionalised interpretations, but still \nenhanced affirmation of self (Hales, 1999; Knights and McCabe, 2003). Thus, \nwithin the fourth cluster, individual agency seems to offer the most likely \nexplanation for the adoption of RL behaviours. Of the six managers who \nreflected RL, four attributed their approach to development experiences, either \non formal programmes, or as the result of career experiences or job transitions \nthat had forced new approaches to leading. In particular, these transitions \nenabled individuals to view their own independence as being strongly linked to \nthose of others. This supports Knights and McCabe\u2019s (2003) notion that \nindividuality is a social not an individual outcome, and is reflective of the political \ninstitutional leadership notion of \u2018civic virtue\u2019. The managers who adopted RL \nbehaviours were engaged in a process of repairing and maintaining a sense of \nidentity by pursuing their own goals and ambitions, whilst balancing these with \nthose of others around them. By placing aside ideals and illusions of autonomy, \nthey created space to explore and enact opportunities for micro emancipation \n 48\n(Alvesson and Willmott, 2002). Those reflecting RL behaviours, tended to see \nthemselves as independent of the goals of the organization, whilst also working \nwithin them, but equally at times undermining them by behaviours and activities \nthat were seen as irreverent by some colleagues.  \n \nSally, (Bookco) provides a good example of this behaviour. She was described \nby her colleagues as \u201cmassively democratic\u2026.and she makes it work\u201d, \u201ca \nbrilliant leader, open to dialogue with whoever, and it interests her\u201d and \u201cthe \nmost stimulating, exciting person I could think of working for\u201d. Sally deliberately \nbuilt an \u2018unofficial\u2019 silo around her business unit in order to enable it to form its \nown distinctive identity and value set and to \u2018protect\u2019 it from corporate \n\u201cinterference\u201d, whilst also contributing to the success of the wider group in \ndifficult times of trading. \n \nThe eventual success of this silo approach led to its formal adoption as a new \n\u2018business model\u2019. In order to achieve this she had to justify its value to a broader \nnumber of constituents, \u201cto have the [my] division seen as an example of how \nwe might work better\u201d. Sally modified and redefined structural resources to \nenable new possibilities for identity formation. This behaviour is also reflective of \nWatson\u2019s notion of \u201cethical assertiveness\u201d\u2019 (2003:182) in which conflicting \npressures are seen as opportunities for managers to fulfil elements of a \npersonal ethical agenda. \n \nThese opportunities were extended by the very agency of representative \nleadership, namely, representing and working with a wide range of \nconstituencies that offered different circumstances in which to negotiate their \nidentity (Alvesson and Willmott, 2002; Perriton, 2000; Handley et al., 2006). For \nexample a manager in Finco described himself as a \u201cmarriage guidance \ncounsellor\u201d working with \u201corganizational couples\u201d Another in Congco defined his \nrole in terms of \u201ca prompt to the organization to actually do something about the \nfuture, so I see my role very much as a way of challenging people about what \nthe future\u2019s going to be like\u201d\u2026and consequently involved himself in many \nrelationships. These relationships appeared to help those embodying RL \nbehaviour to create and sustain different notions of what their work was and \nalso their identity in doing that work (Wrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001). \n \nDefining one\u2019s own identity and autonomy in relation to others is also suggestive \nof a predisposition toward social fairness. Galunic and Eisenhardt (2001) view \nthis as a key element in the development of organizations as social \ncommunities. Courpasson and Dany, quoting Selznick, note that for a \ncommunity to be strong, there must be a desire to further the interests of others, \nnot merely to give them the consideration they deserve as moral equals \n(2003:1249). In effect, this distinction reflects the division between the third and \nfourth cognitive clusters. By working in a way that reflected the implicit mutuality \nof individual goals, and thus the need to further the interests of others rather \nthan merely taking others\u2019 views into account, the behaviour of those operating \nwith cognitions of RL might be seen as indicative of encouraging the formation \n 49\nof just such communities (Courpasson and Dany, 2003; Knights and McCabe, \n2003; Barker, 1997).  \n \nHowever, within each cluster and across the whole sample, there was an \nunderstandable variety of behaviour. Two explanations are offered for this. \nFirstly, that the tensions and contradictions between individual and collective \ninterests, and unity and plurality, create an inevitable ambivalence about the \nlegitimacy of different behaviours. This was perhaps most evident in the \nresponses to the legitimacy of organizational politics, which typifies much \nresearch in this area (Buchanan and Badham, 1999; Butcher and Clarke, 2001). \nThis ambivalence was reflected in both the way politics was discussed and in \nthe way colleagues viewed those managers employing such tactics. Secondly, \nthe process of identity formation is itself the result of just such innumerable \ncontradictory experiences and structures (Alvesson and Willmott, 2002), and \nthus variation in behaviour and cognition are only to be expected. These \ncontradictions also create \u2018organised dissonance\u2019 - the \u201cstrategic union of forms \npresumed to be hostile\u201d (Ashcraft, 2001:1304). In this study, legitimacy of \nplurality and reciprocity of success appear to be significant in enabling \nmanagers to work with these contradictions as a form of \u2018organised dissonance\u2019 \n(ibid); going beyond the notion that more of one necessitates less of the other. \nThis suggests that, whilst the expression of RL will not resolve the tensions \nbetween plurality and coherence, the wider adoption of RL may help to make \nthe tension more constructive. \n \n4.3 A conceptual framework of voluntarism \n \nThe foregoing theorising, research and analysis in this and the last section are \nencapsulated in figure 5, A Model of Voluntarism. The structure of the model is \nbroadly derived from work by Wrzesniewski and Dutton (2001) which, in \ninvestigating the propensity of blue-collar workers to craft their own roles, has \nresonance with managerial voluntarism. This work also contributes to the \ndiscourse on work identity and meanings, and similarly considers the influence \nof structural, relational and organizational influences on individual agency. \nHowever, in using broad descriptors of work orientation such as intrinsic or \nextrinsic motivations, the study provides only a generalised insight into the \nindividual orientations towards job crafting. This problem is exacerbated by the \nauthors supporting their hypothesis with secondary research designed for other \npurposes. One effect of this approach is to provide insufficient analysis of \ninstitutionalised power relations and their effect on individual cognitions. \n \nThe model below positions the politics of individual autonomy as central to \nmanagerial work. Institutionalised power relations, reflected in the socially \nconstructed characteristics of organization, provide the context in which \nmanagers define their work and identities. These are moderated by cognitions \nthat can either confirm or disconfirm the legitimacy of these dominant definitions \nof organizing. Cognitive clusters that promote a positive orientation toward \nplurality, personal interest, assuming authority and models of political behaviour \nare likely to encourage RL behaviours.  \n 50\n \nThis list of clusters should not be seen as exhaustive but indicative of the key \ncognitions that appear to legitimise RL. Specifically, as suggested by the \nempirical research this behaviour leads to voluntaristic outcomes: local identity \nand autonomy, self-organization and the pursuit of organizationally worthwhile \nactivity. In turn, this behaviour is considered to have a general effect of \npromoting more democratic organizational working that reflects wider \nparticipation, distribution of power and the basis for improved organizational \ninnovation. However, the empirical research has been primarily concerned with \nexploring the idea and antecedents of RL, and has not analysed its links to the \ngeneral effects detailed in the model or to wider organizational outcomes. This \nweakness is discussed in section 6.2. \n \nFerdinand (2004) has criticised earlier conceptions of RL and voluntarism \n(Butcher and Clarke, 2002) as being insufficiently plural and too centred on a \nmanagerial elite. Indeed, in the RL study the different constituencies with which \nthese managers defined their identities were predominately managerial in \nstatus. The findings in the research study are based on the analysis of a \nrelatively homogenous sample of managers and restricted to senior hierarchical \nlevels. In largely defining their identities in relation to other managerial groups it \nmight be argued that this process was merely reinforcing a managerial \nhegemony. However, some commentators (see Clegg et al., 2006) note that this \ndelineation between managers and non managers is unduly dichotomous in the \nface of increasing organizational polyphony. If we accept that organizations are \nflattening and thus enabling some degree of power and knowledge distribution, \nFerdinand\u2019s observations may be overly critical. If, having accepted the value of \na plurality of interests, it is arguable that a manager would not then limit the \nenactment of this value to those in formal management positions. Indeed, the \nmanagers working with an RL disposition appeared to make no differentiation \nbetween managers and non managers, and at least two were actively engaged \nin processes of wider employee participation. \n \nFrom the perspective of Structuration Theory, this framework reflects highly \nrecursive thinking and behaviour; the arrowed lines indicate how context and \naction each influence, and are influenced by, the other. In consequence, there \nlies the possibility of intervening in this process, of furthering the adoption of \nvoluntaristic behaviour in the pursuit of both organizational innovation and \ngreater organizational democracy. This possibility is discussed in the next \nsection. \n \n 51\nFigure 5.

An obvious additional \nvehicle is through management education, but then, this too is subject to the \nrationalising effects of unitarism. However, I argue that there is a particular and \nelemental relationship between voluntarism and ML that confers a unique \nopportunity for ML, to effect the development of voluntaristic working. This final \nsection firstly explores this relationship and then gives consideration to what \nsort of educational principles might be required to develop RL in practising \nmanagers. Finally, the likelihood of such principles being implemented is \nassessed in the context of a business school setting. \n \nThis section therefore reflects my original thinking in this area as to the potential \nfor ML to make a difference in society (paper 1, \u2018Management Development: A \nNew Role in Social Change\u2019); criticisms of contemporary approaches to ML \n(paper 2, \u2018Management Development as a Game of Meaningless Outcomes\u2019) \nand more recent treatments of these issues from a specifically articulated \nvoluntaristic viewpoint (paper 4, \u2018Reconciling hierarchy and democracy: the \nvalue of ML\u2019). \n \n5.1 The Synergy between ML and Voluntarism \n \nA Resonance between the Tenets of ML and Voluntarism \nThe first reason for perceiving an elemental relationship between ML and \nvoluntarism lies in the idea that the principles of voluntaristic working\/RL reflect \na high degree of congruence with liberal adult educational (AE) values and it is \nwithin this field that much of the discourse on Management Learning has \nbecome situated (Burgoyne and Jackson, 1997; Clarke and Butcher, 2006a). \nFrom a liberal reformist perspective, AE, in the western world is a tradition that \ndepends on faith in informed free choice, self-awareness, emancipation through \nself-understanding, and a capacity for self-reflection through rational discourse \n(Mezirow, 2000). Over time much ML activity has come to embody many of \nthese tenets of liberal AE philosophy. Three AE tenets in particular have \nresonance with a voluntaristic approach: challenge and critique, plurality of \ninterest and the need for protected learning environments (Clarke and Butcher, \n2006a). \n \nFirstly, a key product of AE\/ML is the value of critique, especially of power \nrelationships and their impact on how individuals frame and resolve issues \n(Brookfield, 2001). In an organizational setting, encouraging a heightened \nawareness of the impact of institutionalised power provides the possibility for \nrevealing how a unitary frame of reference constrains more democratic \n 53\norganizational forms and the possibilities for micro emancipation that a \nvoluntaristic mindset can facilitate (Clarke and Butcher, 2006a).  \n \nThe second area in which AE and voluntaristic principles converge is the value \nattached to polyphony \u2013 the value of a multiplicity of voices and interests \n(Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2005; Clegg, et al., 2006). Central to both liberal \nAE and ML is the need for adults to \u201ccritically reflect on, appropriately validate, \nand effectively act on their (and others\u2019) beliefs, interpretations, values, feelings \nand ways of thinking (Mezirow, 2000:26). In an ML setting Burgoyne and \nJackson (1997) operationalise this value in their thesis of ML as a \u2018pluralist \narena\u2019 where spaces need to be created and protected to encourage debate \nabout organizational purpose and values. As organizations fragment into \nsmaller, devolved operating units, effective organizational governance becomes \nmore dependent on satisfying these diverse interests and claims to (partial) \nindependence. Voluntarism, like ML takes the reconciliation of this polyphony of \ninterests as key to collective organizational endeavour being sustained. These \nsectional interests need to have a \u2018voice\u2019, the autonomy and the independence \nof mind to participate in debate about contested views (Cludts, 1999). The \npresence of AE values of challenge and critique, open discourse, and a \nwillingness to seek voluntary agreement, strengthen the political processes \nrequired for reconciling competing interests inherent in a voluntaristic approach. \nIn this way, Coopey and Burgoyne describe politics as \u201cthe midwife to flexible \norganizational forms\u201d (2000:881) \n \nFinally, implicit in the notion of liberal AE is its subversive and irreverent nature, \nsuch that \u201cwhen AE has a purpose to \u2018change\u2019 society in either radical or \nreformative respects, authority is likely to curb it\u201d (Thomas, 1982:57). \nConsequently, as Mezirow points out, adult educators often create \u201cprotected \nenvironments\u201d in which to foster learning insights, as free as possible from the \ninfluence of unequal power relationships (2000:31). Whilst Mezirow\u2019s point is \npredominantly made to highlight the importance of collaborative learning \nrelationships in AE, the idea is picked up by other authors. For example, Yorks \nand Marsick (2000) recognise that the questioning and voluntary nature of AE \nmay well be considered threatening by senior management. They argue that \norganizations need to create space for learning to take place, but point out that \nbecause of the unpredictable outcomes from such activities, senior \nmanagement may be apprehensive about doing so.  \n \nThe possibility of creating protected environments to foster emancipation from \nhierarchical thinking is similarly central to the tenets of voluntarism described \nhere and reflected in the research described in this thesis. Importantly, it \nembodies the reflexivity inherent in liberal AE practice in that it explicitly \nacknowledges voluntarisms\u2019 subversive tendencies. \n \nIn essence, as described in section 4, a voluntaristic mindset potentially \nrepresents an organising principle that enables greater levels of personal \nautonomy. At the individual level, liberal adult education is also fundamentally \nconcerned with this goal (Mezirow, 2000). On this basis voluntarism provides a \n 54\npractical vehicle for the implementation of the ML agenda and should resonate \nwith liberal adult educators seeking to encourage the wider adoption of the \nemancipatory project.  \n \nEnds and Means for Management Educators \nThe second reason for synergy between ML and voluntarism lies in the idea that \nvoluntarism potentially provides the end and the means for management \neducators. That is, in an environment where the aspirational aims of AE\/ML \nhave been largely unfulfilled (Burgoyne and Jackson, 1997), the goal of creating \nmore choice for individuals can be accelerated by corporate ML professionals, \nadopting voluntaristic\/RL behaviours themselves in their own organizations. (RL \nbehaviours may be especially salient for those working in a Business school \nsetting and this idea will be explored in more detail in section 5.5.) \n \nML as an Agent of Change \nThe final source of ML-voluntarism synergy reflects the accepted role of ML as \nan organizational change agent. Business is increasingly viewed as a complex \nactivity and success is dependent upon an ability to create sufficient wealth, \nvalue or satisfaction for all stakeholders (Clarkson, 1995). In turn then, \nmanagers need to embrace this plurality in order to ensure organizational \nsurvival. In order to effect this transition business leaders will themselves \ntherefore need to encourage ML activity that is responsive to a polyphony of \nvoices. Indeed, at this point in time, if this sort of role does not come from ML, \nwhere else will it come from? \n \nHaving established, at least in theory, the elemental relationship between ML \nand voluntarism, I now turn to consider two key questions. Firstly, what sort of \npedagogic principles are required to encourage voluntarism in a development \nsetting, and secondly, given the fact that, as yet AE\/ML goals remain largely \nunfulfilled, what factors might encourage the adoption of these principles as \neducational practice? \n \n5.2 Educational Principles Required to Develop RL \n \nI have defined a voluntaristic mindset as one in which managers recognise the \nneed to engage in debate and action to represent matters of individual and \norganizational concern irrespective of hierarchical position or explicit authority. \nGiven the asymmetric power distributions at work in organizations, any \ndevelopment activity designed to encourage this orientation must therefore \nreflect the need to disrupt the dominant narrative of unitarism. This requires \nindividuals to be more self-reflective - to deliberate, judge, choose and act upon \ncourses of action. This next section considers what sort of learning\/development \nprinciples might facilitate such an approach.  \n \nThe earlier analysis of RL was informed by the discourse on identity and work \nmeanings and this field of study too has contributed to recent research on \nlearning as a process of identity construction (Lave and Wenger 1991, Huzzard \nand \u04e6stergren, 2002). A person\u2019s identity resides in his or her capacity to \n 55\nmaintain a particular personal \u2018narrative\u2019 but when institutional conditions in \nwhich viable narratives are constructed change, individuals may find \nopportunities for reformulating these identities (Danieli and Thomas, 1999). The \nincreasing complexity, uncertainty and contradictory nature of contemporary \nmanagerial life represents one such opportunity, and ML a vehicle for both \nrevealing this possibility and for facilitating the process of identity reformulation \n(Perriton, 2000). The following analysis approaches the development of a \nvoluntaristic mindset from this perspective: of disrupting dominant narratives of \nunitary and rational management and encouraging individuals to voluntarily \nreformulate their identities with reference to a plurality of organizational interests \nand communities.  \n \nThe Value of Critical Management Theory in ML \nThis does of course reflect a highly politicised agenda, but then management \neducation is implicitly political (Coopey and Burgoyne, 2000; Reynolds, 1999) \nand many of the shortcomings of ML can be attributed to a failure to \nacknowledge the restricted set of values at play in much of its execution \n(Clarke, 1999a; Grey, 2004). Indeed, this viewpoint is central to Critical \nManagement Theory (CMT) the development of which has been at the forefront \nof proposing alternative approaches to management education that explicitly \nseek to challenge existing management practice rather than sustain it (Grey and \nMitev, 1995; Reynolds, 1998, 1999; Dehler et al, 2001). As such, a critical \npedagogy has much to contribute to the design of development processes that \nseek to dislocate and reposition managerial identities. For example, such an \napproach directly addresses issues of vested power and politics in both an \norganizational and educational context.  \n \nHowever, the CMT pedagogy has attracted criticisms from both inside and \noutside of its own tradition that question the practicality of its application. For \nexample, CMT has been taken to task for neglecting workable proposals in \nfavour of \u201cgrand utopian utterances\u201d (Gibson cited in Reynolds, 1999:177); for \npromulgating its ideas with such authority that it silences the dialogue it seeks \npromote (Alvesson and Wilmott, 1996; Reynolds, 1999); and for cutting the \nworld into simplistic positions of oppressed and oppressors (Fenwick, 2005; \nClegg et al., 2006). Perhaps, as a result, Reynolds notes that a critical \nperspective has yet to make significant inroads into business school curricula \n(1999:174). \n \nIn response to this problem, a more pragmatic theme has emerged in the \ndevelopment of critical thinking in ML (Watson, 2001b; Fenwick, 2005; Clegg et \nal., 2006). In essence, this approach still seeks to reject the view of \nmanagement as a morally and politically neutral technical activity but also takes \naccount of the basic logic of the management educator\u2019s role to improve the \nquality of managerial activity (Watson, 2001b). Perriton and Reynolds (2004) \ndescribe this as a fourth wave of educational practice in which the aim is to \nencourage emancipation through a refusal to accept a managerialist standpoint. \nFor Watson, the value of this position lies in both being able to question the \nnotion of absolute truth reflected in rational and unitary thinking but also one \n 56\nwhich remains open to the idea that some theories may be truer than others. In \npractice therefore some guides to action may be more effective in certain \ncircumstances (2001b:387).  \n \nOn this basis, and building upon the emerging spirit of pragmatism in the CMT \nliterature, I provide below an overview of the basic pedagogic principles \nrequired to develop a voluntaristic mindset. Other than where a voluntaristic \napproach may differ from existing approaches, it is not the intention in this \nthesis to describe these in detail. Fuller descriptions, from which these \nprinciples are drawn can be found in Grey, 2004; Watson, 2001b; Lewis and \nDehler, 2000, Clarke, 1998, 1999a, 1999b; Bowman et al., 2004; Dehler et al., \n2001; Dehler, 1998; Reynolds, 1998; Mintzberg and Gosling, 2002; Atkinson, \n1999; Brewis, 1996; and Densten and Gray, 2001.  \n \nThe development of a voluntaristic mindset which reflects a positive orientation \ntoward plurality of interests, personal interest, managerial discretion and political \nmodels of behaviour might be encouraged by development activities which: \n \n\u0089 Facilitate critical reflection: about processes of power and claims to \nrationality and organizational unitarism; raising questions about the interests of \nthose who determine the production and dissemination of knowledge; \nquestioning assumptions in theory and professional practice. \n \n\u0089 Develop \u201cself insight and awareness\u2026..for keeping a clear perspective \non the external world; in combination the individual becomes aware of their \nprojections of their internal world onto the external world and how the external \nworld activates their internal fantasies and emotions\u201d (Bowman et al., 2004:19). \n \n\u0089 Problematise organizations, management and leadership: incorporating \ncritique into the analysis of managerial tools, theories and ideas from different \nperspectives; surface paradox and contradiction between equally well-based \norganizational assumptions: engaging in \u2018either and thinking\u2019 without denying \nthe logic of at least one of the assumptions; working with ambiguity and \nuncertainty, multiple realities and organizational complexity; raising complexity \nof individual thinking. \n \n\u0089 Considers managerial work as a social and political practice: politics as a \nlegitimate process to protect\/promote diversity and voice; politics as a means of \ngetting things done; of promoting choice; politics as a natural consequence of \nplural organization forms. \n \n\u0089 Values dialogue: conflict is inevitable and desirable; dialogue as a \nprocess for accepting and respecting different views as to how to execute one\u2019s \nown; for explicating assumptions; \u2018dis-census\u2019 as a trigger for social action, \nlearning and unlearning; and that these differences form the basis for:  \n \n 57\n\u0089 Organizations based on a community of communities which; forge links \nwith outsiders; drive innovation; facilitate multiple identity formation; and \nencourage voluntarism.  \n \nDrawbacks to a CMT approach to ML \nCritical management education (CME) however, also places heavy emphasis on \nother development principles not mentioned above. In particular, these include, \ncollaborative learning design, reducing the relative power differences between \ntutor and student, collaborative assessment procedures, ensuring that the \ncomplex social processes of management are not reduced to a psychological \nand individualistic focus, and a reluctance to provide managers with solutions \n(see Grey, 2004; Reynolds, 1999; 2000). Some of these themes appear to be \nbased on assumptions that most management education takes place on \ngraduate and under graduate programmes and the authors are critical of the \nvalue of short executive development programmes. This position is predicated \non the view that such programmes are most likely to be controlled by an \norganizational agenda dominated by managerialist and technicist values \n(Reynolds, 1999). Whilst longer term graduate programmes offer good \npossibilities for incorporating the above development principles, I argue that \nshorter term executive development activities can provide an equally effective \nvehicle for developing managers to work with a voluntaristic mindset.  \n \nWhilst it may be argued that in short courses, collaborative design and \nandrogogy are difficult to implement, Tight (1996) points out that androgogy \nremains a largely idealist goal: hierarchy will always be present in the classroom \n(Perriton and Reynolds, 2004) as it is in organizations. Rather than seeking to \nextinguish inevitable power differences, educators should acknowledge them \n(Grey, 2004) and put them to more constructive use, for example, role modelling \nkey (representative) leadership behaviours such as questioning, listening and \nreflecting. Also in short term open enrolment executive (OEE) programmes the \nissue of student assessment is largely removed as it is the tutor whose is being \nevaluated by the student rather than the other way around. \n \nCM educators also express concerns about excessive \u2018psychologicalism\u2019 in \nmuch management education - reducing complex social processes to those of \nindividual psychology. Yet the CMT agenda to foster new mental models of \norganising and managing is one that is implicitly concerned with the psychology \nof managers and management. As well as dismantling reductionist and \nmanagerialist mindsets, responsible management education must be concerned \nwith providing robust alternatives - improving the quality of the practices of \nmanagement students (Watson, 2001b; Fenwick, 2005). Clearly, educators \nmust be wary of solutions that merely exacerbate unitary approaches to \norganizing but should not shy away from providing guidance, possibilities, \nframeworks, even checklists, as long as these reflect a plurality of perspectives \nand are not offered as the solution. If, as Watson (2001b) highlights, some \ntheories of the world are better guides to effective action than others, then, in \norder for managers to debate and contest dominant views of organizing in the \nworkplace, they need to develop their own well-thought through ideas.  \n 58\nI therefore deviate from some of the CME literature in two particular ways. \nFirstly, whilst firmly adopting the principle of dialogue as a process for accepting \nand respecting different views as to how to execute one\u2019s own (Huzzard and \n\u04e6stergren, 2002), I argue that it is the educator\u2019s responsibility to provide \npractical alternative approaches. In this way, promoting the principles of \nvoluntarism and representational leadership as guides to local action should not \nbe viewed as being in tension with CME, but should be seen as a potential \nsource of micro-emancipation.  \n \nSecondly, my approach places a greater emphasis upon exploring an \nindividual\u2019s psychological orientation to managing and organizing. A \nvoluntaristic mindset can be accelerated by deliberately disrupting dominant \nnarratives of unitary and rational management through a managed process of \ndevelopment. There are many well documented approaches to this type of \ndislocation (see Clarke, 1998; Quinn, 1988; Bartunek, 1988; Westenholz, 1993; \nMintzberg and Gosling, 2002) and they need not be described in detail here, but \nin essence reflect four stages; creating a motivation towards the development of \nnew capabilities, a period of discomfort where old behaviours are unlearned, a \nfocussed transition which moves the individual towards the goals they have \nidentified and an understanding of how these new capabilities can be applied in \ntheir organizational context (Atkinson, 1999). This process is not antithetical to \nthe development principles listed above if the individual\u2019s development is always \ngrounded in the students\u2019 lived work experience (Grey, 2004:183), personal \naspirations and motivations. For example, this might involve using individual \nnarratives that highlight organizational inequalities and which would be analysed \n\u201cbeyond micro terms and individual personalities or simple cause and effect \nrelations to examine organizational structures\u201d, - rewards, knowledge and \nculture (Fenwick, 2005:40). \u201cSuch an approach promotes both a social \nawareness of work relations and, perhaps the crucial requisite of this, a self-\nawareness of the impact of one\u2019s own conduct upon others and upon the \ncompletion of the work task\u201d (Grey, 2004:183).  \n \n5.3 The Adoption of these Principles in B Schools \n \nNotwithstanding the probity of this approach, we are nevertheless left with the \ncentral question of why senior management would be willing to embrace this \nform of development. The evidence detailed here is hardly sufficient for \ncorporate ML professionals to challenge deeply embedded beliefs about rational \norganization, whether this is on the grounds of organizational effectiveness or \nethical governance (Clarke and Butcher, 2006a). Indeed, many corporate ML \nprofessionals might be viewed as further promoting the myth of rational \norganization (Clarke, 1999b). \n \nIn Clarke (1999b) an argument is made that much organizationally controlled \nML is trapped in a game of meaningless outcomes; caught in a vicious cycle in \nwhich further investment in ML reinforces the myth of rationality. In the bid to \ncreate more competitive organisations, \u2018soft HRM\u2019 approaches which promote \ninvolvement, empowerment, etc. allow managers to embed a more effective \n 59\nalignment of people resources. This \u2018truth, trust, love and collaboration\u2019 \napproach to change (Buchanan and Boddy, 1992) helps creates the ritual and \nsymbolism that contributes to the legitimisation of the organizational ML \nagenda. Yet, either because corporate ML professionals lack credibility, and\/or \nthat the rational mindset can undermine the enactment of effective people \nstrategy, financial objectives tend to be given precedence over people \ndevelopment. Thus, line management receives mixed messages about what is \nimportant. Managers respond to this with public acceptance but private rejection \nof the messages contained within ML interventions in order to ring fence \npsychological needs for the preservation of self. This apparent acceptance \nstimulates more investment by senior management which promulgates the myth \nthat ML works. The \u2018rational\u2019 game is played and the actors participate, playing \nthe game that everyone pretends has value because it is in their interests to do \nso, to create promotions, obtain security, and so on. \n \nIf corporate ML professionals have been largely impotent in breaking out of this \nmindset or of introducing the aspirational values of AE, it seems improbable that \nthey will be able to make a cogent argument for initiating the principle of \nvoluntarism as an alternative means of accomplishing coherence. The same \npreoccupation with unitary thinking, whether organizationally or self-imposed is \nlikely to prevail. As Reynolds (2000) notes, whilst there are some glimpses of \nsuch development principles being applied in practice, it is hard to identify \nmanagement education practice that clearly reflects the \u2018politics of difference\u2019.  \n \nProfessional associations, however, such as the Institute of Directors or \nChartered Institute of Personnel and Development, which at least in theory work \noutside of such corporate game playing, could provide the necessary protected \nopportunities and diversity of approach for the dislocation and reframing of \nexisting approaches. However, the limited empirical work on the impact of \nprofessional associations (Farndale and Brewster, 2005) suggests that activities \nsuch as training and development are mechanisms of reproduction rather than \nchange (Greenwood et al., 2002). Whilst such associations usually have a \nreforming agenda, this is often, as in the study of accountancy associations by \nGreenwood et al. (2002), in response to change initiated by their \u2018corporate\u2019 \nmembers rather than as a result of their own mandate.  \n \nPerhaps the natural candidate, although by no means the only candidate, for an \nalternative approach is the academic community, most particularly business \nschools, since their intellectual sovereignty should provide not only critique, but \nalso the protected environment necessary to consider the values of voluntarism. \nHowever, the proposition that business schools deliver such independence is a \nmatter of considerable controversy. At the centre of this debate has been the \nconcern that business schools have become unduly responsive to institutional \npressures for greater vocationalism and for the professionalisation of \nmanagement that takes insufficient account of the social, political and ethical \naspects of managing (Reed and Anthony, 1992; Willmott, 1994; Holman, 2000; \nReynolds, 2000). One effect of this is that managers may only \u2018surface learn\u2019 \nand be unable to engage with the deep level processing required to grasp the \n 60\nsignificance of AE values in practice (Watson, 1996:461). As Burrell (1989) puts \nit, they learn with their beliefs rather than about their beliefs. Furthermore, \nbecause the intellectual heritage of many business school faculty leads them to \nemphasise the cerebral rather than the emotional domain of learning (Cornuel, \n2005), the developmental agenda implicit in AE values is rarely part of the \ncurriculum (Willmott, 1994).  \n \nHowever, the view that B schools have had such a negative impact on the \ndevelopment of contemporary management practices (MacDonald, 2003; \nPfeffer and Fong, 2002; Mintzberg, 2004) is indicative that they can have a \nsignificant influence on future practices too. In contemporary society, the \nuniversity [business school] represents a value well beyond its functional role \n(Delanty, 2001). University education, more than 1000 years old, is deeply \nembedded in society as a transformer of science and culture (Delanty, 2001) \nand business education is considered by some to be one of the greatest \nsuccesses of the modern world (Lorenzi, 2004): a source of social prosperity \n(Hubbard, 2006; Bilimoria, 2000). Despite recent criticism, with such institutional \nstatus, the B school carries a symbolic value for business and holds the \ncapacity to exert a disproportionate influence on future management behaviour. \nThus, even small changes in the institutional approach of business schools may \nassume a significance far beyond the immediacy of a differentiated educational \nprogramme and can have the potential to exact an undue change upon \nbusiness practice. \n \nWorking from this starting point, I argue that there are now several converging \npressures that are likely to have a significant impact on both the demand and \nsupply of business school education over the next decade (Hawawini, 2005). \nSeveral of these influences were explored in papers 1 and 2 (Clarke 1999a, \n1999b) and for the purpose of this thesis have been updated and expanded \nhere in the light of recent trends and changes in B school education. This \nanalysis suggests that these changes have the potential to encourage B school \nfaculty to adopt the development principles outlined in 5.2, either explicitly or \nthrough stealth. The final sections of this chapter consider these changes, how \nthey will influence the B-school agenda and conclude that progress may be \nmade in accelerating the adoption reformist AE values and organizational \nvoluntarism by management educators pursuing, within a B school environment, \nthe very representative leadership behaviours discussed here.  \n \n5.4 Changes in Demand \n \nThe Search for Relevance in Management Education \nAs part of a wider debate on the future for universities in the knowledge society \n(Delanty, 2001; Trowler, 2001), B schools have come under increasing critical \nscrutiny from the general media, business and academia itself (Bilimoria, 2000). \nThese criticisms include amongst many; an undue focus on analysis at the \nexpense of wisdom (Pfeffer and Fong, 2002), a superficial and narrow \nmanagerialist perspective (MacDonald, 2003), neglecting the emotional domain \nof learning (Watson, 1996; Willmott, 1994), the need for more external \n 61\nperspective (Conger and Xin, 2000), the omission of power from the curriculum \n(Weick et al., 1999, cited in Martin and Butler, 2000) and the need to \nacknowledge the politics of management education (Grey, 2004). More \nspecifically, Mintzberg (2004) highlights how US MBA programmes in particular \nare directed at the wrong people (too few practising managers), using the wrong \nmethods (teaching disconnected theory rather than learning in context) for the \nwrong reasons (producing managers who believe they have the right to lead \nbecause of their credentials). Amongst other effects, this growing debate has \nsuggested, contrary to my position in this thesis, that there is little evidence of \nbusiness school research changing management practice, calling into question \nthe professional relevance of management scholarship (Hambrick, 1993; Pfeffer \nand Fong, 2002). \n \nCompetitive Pressures \nAgainst this backdrop of mounting criticism about the relevance and \neffectiveness of much business education, B schools also have to contend with \nsignificant changes in their markets caused by changes in global demand, \ntechnology, deregulation and demographic shifts (Clarke, 1999a; Friga et al., \n2003). These changes are seen to require B schools to extend their capacity to \nprovide education through higher volumes and geographic reach (serving \nclients in their home countries); providing wider access through internet based \nlearning and through multiple (international) interconnected locations (Friga et \nal, 2003; Hawawini, 2005). Lorange (2005) argues that in the emerging \nnetworked society students will be more demanding of educators. Managers \nhave less time to access learning but are more focussed on continual top-ups \nthroughout a career so that education moves from being conceived as \u2018just in \ncase\u2019 to \u2018just for me\u2019 (Friga et al., 2003). B schools will therefore need to \nbecome more responsive multi located businesses, effectively networked to \npartners, alumni, customers and government (Lorange, 2005). All of these \ntrends provide opportunities for leading B schools to build brand differentiation \n(Friga et al., 2003). \u201cThe challenge for these schools is to go beyond delivering \na degree. They must deliver a life changing experience\u2026.\u201d (Hawawini, \n2005:778). When set against the increasing influence of B school rankings, \nthese pressures for differentiation and convenience suggest an increasing focus \non product innovation and experimentation (Westerbeck, 2004) that can provide \nopportunities for developing an AE reformist agenda. \n \nChanging Business Needs \nExtensive reference has already been made to the changing nature of \norganizing in contemporary business (see section 2.1). In particular, arguments \nhave been made here to highlight the fit between voluntarism, representational \nleadership and the need for firms in the future to be more innovative, adaptable, \nand devolved (sections 3.3-3.4). This requirement is also bolstered by \ncommentators calling for more inclusive corporate governance (Child and \nRodrigues, 2003; Courpasson and Dany, 2003), organizational democracy \n(Gratton, 2004; Harrison and Freeman, 2004), and management education that \ntakes greater account of business ethics (Gioia, 2002; Waddock, 2004). \nHawawini (2005) believes these issues can be addressed by a greater \n 62\ndetermination to develop \u2018societal skills\u2019 in managers, defined as the ability to \nmake business decisions that are ethical and which take account of corporate \nsocial responsibility and sustainable development. In reality, such an outcome \ncan only be realised through educational activity that places an emphasis on \npersonal development that provides an opportunity for managers to learn about \ntheir values. The publicity about corporate scandals over recent years serves to \nstimulate demand for business school curricula that are relevant to these \nbusiness and societal needs. \n \nA willingness to challenge in the Organizational ML Community \nResearch into the orientations of corporate ML professionals suggests that \nthere may also be a growing willingness on behalf of ML managers to challenge \nthe current orthodoxy of unitary approaches to organizing to be found in many B \nschools. Perriton\u2019s (2000) study of 14 management development practitioners \nrevealed a range of heretical management behaviours that reflected a \n\u2018pedagogy of doubt\u2019. These heretics were aware of the power inherent in their \nroles and encouraged a critique of the management theories they promoted. \nThe study also identified \u2018management liberators\u2019 who, through their \ndevelopment activities sought to replace a managerialist identity with a wider \nconception of self not limited to occupational role. From a different perspective, \nbut no less heretical, research by Clarke et al. (2002) identified ML \nprofessionals who were highly conscious about the centrality of power in \nassessing and working with a plurality of interests and who eschewed rational \nunitary approaches to change favouring highly political strategies that relied on, \nstealth, relationship management, and bottom up change. Such ML \nprofessionals are likely to use B school programmes that serve their own \nheretical agenda. \n \n5.5 Changes in Supply \n \nIn this environment, progress toward a reformist AE agenda may also be \naccelerated by developments in the supply of ML through both top down and \nbottom up processes of change.  \n \nTop Down \nThe competitive pressures in the business education market place are forcing \nB-schools to consider how best to \u2018form the future not simply follow it\u2019 \n(Westerbeck, 2004). The consequent need to innovate and experiment will lead \nto greater market segmentation and \u201cunique combinations\u201d of product offerings \n(Friga et al., 2003:247). At a time when many business schools are devoting \nmore and more attention toward revising MBA products (Friga et al., 2003), \nopen enrolment executive programmes have received insufficient attention as a \nsource of innovation in executive education. Over recent years, most university-\nbased executive education has focussed on moving towards in-company and \ncustomized activities (Conger and Xin, 2000; Fulmer and Wagner, 1999). \nHowever, I argue that open enrolment executive (OEE) programmes offer real \nopportunities for innovation and experimentation and, echoing Bennis and \n 63\nO\u2019Toole (2005:103) and others, for B schools to use the sort of strategies that \nthey promote to their business clients.  \n \nIn dynamic markets, B-schools need to respond quickly to shifting and \ntemporary demand. For governance reasons, responding to these requirements \nby the development of degree programmes will always be a much slower \nprocess than through executive education. Similarly, in-company development \nrequires extensive needs analysis and customisation, whilst in contrast, OEE \nprogrammes offer business schools a vehicle to respond quickly to market \nchanges via small, nimble, branded and flexible business units. Conger and Xin \n(2000) note a number of challenges for executive education in the next few \nyears which include: the need for managers to possess wider perspectives that \nare external to individual industries; a focus on future orientated competencies; \nincreased line involvement in determining development needs; and action \nlearning involving external and diverse inputs. OEE programmes are ideally \nplaced to meet these needs.  \n \nAs governments continue to reduce subsidies to public universities, this issue of \nalternative financing may also encourage reform. Although some commentators \n(Hawawini, 2005) view the increasing focus on in-company executive education \nreducing the attractiveness and margins on OEE programmes, they potentially \noffer new income streams for B schools. With the growing sophistication of e-\nmarketing, smaller OEE focussed business units have the opportunity to be \nnimble and agile, to both lead and respond to these types of requirements and \nchanging customer demand. The Cranfield School of Management General \nManagement Programmes constitute one such example where a small \ncustomer focussed business unit has crafted a portfolio of programmes that \nconcentrate on developing a future orientated general management perspective \nat key career transitions. These combine both the acquisition of new managerial \nknowledge and intensive personal development that encourages an irreverent \nand challenging approach to rational organising. As programmes are composed \nof managers from diverse backgrounds and experiences, they offer participants \nthe opportunity to work on their own organizational issues supported and \nchallenged by a diverse range of individuals.  \n \nThese types of programme can capitalise on emerging niche markets such as \n\u2018The Networked Organization\u2019 or \u2018Business Ethics\u2019 and very much reflect the \nmove from \u2018just in case\u2019 to \u2018just for me\u2019 development highlighted by Friga et al., \n(2003). Nor do these programmes need to be many weeks in duration in order \nto effect the development principles outlined in section 5.2. (See Clarke, 1998; \nAtkinson, 1999; Western and Gosling, 2002 for some examples). Such \nprogrammes may well appeal to the heretics and irreverent corporate sponsors \nidentified by Perriton (2000) and Clarke et al. (2002), as potential vehicles for \nencouraging challenge and change within their organizations. \n \nA further factor that may influence executive action in this area is the increasing \ndifficulty of recruiting and retaining good quality faculty (Nemetz and Cameron, \n2006). Research by Verhaegan (2005) covering Deans\/Directors from 69 B \n 64\nschools from 18 countries indicates that Deans rank the need for innovation and \nprogressiveness as being most important in recruiting and retaining talent. \nDeans also believe this factor is within their power to influence. The research \nalso encompassed 347 faculty in 38 schools from 12 counties. Responses from \nfaculty indicated that academic freedom was considered the most important \nfactor in attracting and retaining talent. Willingness on behalf of Deans to \nrespond to this key driver and to encourage such innovation further suggests \nthe possibility of change in the institutional template (Gentile and Samuelson, \n2005).   \n \nClearly, the degree to which these trends might encourage the wider adoption of \nAE values will, to a significant degree, be dependent on the educational \norientation of Deans and their executives but will also be influenced by the \naspirations of those ML academics responsible for programme design and \ndelivery. Without a commitment to an AE agenda, such customer responsive, \nbranded business units may merely serve to embed a unitary approach to \nmanaging. The significance of these market changes therefore lies in the \nopportunity for management educators to exploit these new competitive \npressures for their own goals.  \n \nBottom up  \nThe discussion above (5.2) has highlighted the increasing debate within \nacademia, particularly from within the CMT and liberal AE communities, as to \nthe role of ML in sustaining or challenging the dominant rational paradigm in \norganizations (Clarke, 1999a, 1999b; Perriton, 2000; Perriton and Reynolds, \n2004; Danielli and Thomas, 1999; Watson, 2001b). Watson (2001b) in particular \nhas been vocal about the need for this community to come to terms with the \nlogic of its role to deliver improved managerial practice whilst still being critical \nof its enactment. Perriton and Reynolds (2004) describe this orientation as \nbeing akin to \u2018colonisers\u2019, who, whilst working within the dominant rational \nideology refuse to act in the spirit of managerialism and are active in debating \nits reform. Examples of such autonomous action within academic communities \nare provided by R\u00e4s\u00e4nen and M\u00e4ntyl\u00e4 (2001) who report on a deliberate \nstrategy to resist pressures to conform to centrally determined priorities in a \nFinnish university and by Gustavs and Clegg\u2019s (2005) account of the \nintroduction of work based learning in an Australian university. Research by \nDanieli and Thomas (1999) highlights the degree to which the values of \nacademic management educators should not be considered homogenous, \nsuggesting that, at least, there are probably few normative occupational \nrestraints to educators working in this way. The new competitive pressures in \nmanagement education might thus be used by politically motivated ML \nacademics to exploit the loopholes and contradictions (Alvesson and Willmott, \n1996) of unitary education.  \n \nFor example, OEE programmes offer those academics wishing to challenge \nrational orthodoxy, the opportunity to engage more with practising business \nleaders. These managers are in a position to be immediately influential on the \nbusiness of business whereas degree programmes with electives in \u2018very \n 65\nradical critical studies\u2019, are populated by students who are organizationally \nimmature and who are unlikely to have the credibility or experience to effect \nsubstantive change. My own undergraduate exposure to this orientation by one \nof today\u2019s leading critical theorists made little impact on my own managerial \npractice. This was not because of ineffective teaching. The ideas were inspiring, \nbut once employed in the corporate world with no influence or experience, such \nradical views were inoperable. In short, OEE programmes provide a vehicle for \nmore readily raising issues of managerialism in the boardroom as well as the \nclassroom (Fenwick, 2005). \n \nWorking on OEE programmes, which demand high \u2018practicality\u2019, requires \nmanagement educators to find new approaches to presenting their ideas in a \nway which genuinely resonate with the lived experience of managing. For \nexample, debating the value of organizational politics, an issue close to the \nhearts of most managers, would surface issues of institutionalised power, \nplurality, vested interests and choice (Fenwick 2005; Clarke 1999b). This \napproach reflects a view taken by Kreiner (2003) and others that educators \nmust be able to discuss issues of rational organization using methods that make \nmanagers think in non rational ways. Working on OEE programmes in this way \nwill require those of a CMT persuasion to be less purist in their approach to \nemancipation (Perriton and Reynolds, 2004) using them to explore wider \ndevelopmental possibilities than those originally considered by participants \n(Clarke 1999b).  \n \nIn order to exploit these opportunities, academic management educators may \nwell have to become more business focussed and exercise higher levels of \npolitical savvy themselves in order to carve out independent \nbusinesses\/development processes and run them successfully. Gentile and \nSamuelson (2005) and Hendry (2006) describe this opportunity in terms of \nmanagement educators needing to become the leaders they seek to create, \nusing small wins to create momentum. One option for educators is to see \nthemselves as Representative Leaders: representing the emancipatory interests \nof participants, the business\/education demands of their B School and the \nbusiness\/organizational interests of the sponsoring companies (Clarke, 1999a). \nIn this way, voluntarism might become the end and means by which \nmanagement educators can have greater impact on the lives of organizational \nactors. Applying the tenets of RL to management educators suggests \nbehaviours that might reflect the following types of activity; \n \n\u0089 Providing space and opportunities on OEE programmes for colleagues \nto experiment with the development principles identified in 5.2 or to use \nresearch findings that promote aspects of voluntarism. \n \n\u0089 Promoting debate in formal and informal faculty meetings about the role \nof executive development in the business school, challenging existing \narrangements. \n \n 66\n\u0089 Working outside of agreed responsibilities, with a broad network of like-\nminded colleagues on unofficial projects and initiatives that may undermine \nexisting approaches. \n \n\u0089 Equipping programme participants with the political acumen to challenge \nrationalistic approaches to development within their own organization and to act \nas sponsors of further irreverent development. \n \n\u0089 Developing relationships with heretical corporate educators, providing \nopportunities for voice, implementing development designs that are challenging \nof rational mindsets. \n \n\u0089 Engaging in constructive political activity to secure resources, time and \nspace to implement the above, for example positioning the value of executive \nincome alongside that of research income.  \n \n \nThese ideas are of course, fraught with substantial dilemmas, barriers and \nassumptions. Micro-processes of change are not capable of overturning \ninstitutional templates on their own (Johnson et al., 1997); they will need to be \naugmented by larger scale regulatory frameworks. But they can initiate a wind \nof change precisely because they \u201ccan have more direct relevance to the lived \nexperience of people who are continually engaged in local struggles\u201d (Alvesson \nand Willmott, 1996:176, their emphasis). The focus for this section has been to \nprovide a view of how ML might be able to play a very different role in \norganizational change by adopting more subversive and critical values. This \ncould provide an opportunity for B schools to fulfil a more substantial educative \nrole in social as well as organizational change (Clarke, 1999a).  \n \n 67\n \n6. Conclusion  \n \n6.1 Practical Contribution: the Role of Voluntarism in Stimulating Organization \nDemocracy \n \nThere has been a growing concern amongst some commentators about the \ndisconnection between the apparent increase in organizational plurality, and the \nrelatively limited facets of democracy practised in the work place (Etzioni, 1998; \nRousseau and Rivero, 2003). Despite a range of forces promoting greater \ndemocratic practice such as; changes in technology; greater employee \naspirations for choice and autonomy (Gratton, 2004); the increase in, and \ninterdependence of, organizational stakeholders (Caldart and Ricart, 2004; \nColbert, 2004); and the need to secure employee commitment through more \ndistributed models of leadership (Butcher and Clarke, 2001), most western \norganizations still rely on traditional top down hierarchy for most of their \nstrategic decisions (Powley et al., 2004).  \n \nVarious explanations are suggested for this disconnection. Rousseau and \nRivero, (2003) view the increased mobility of employees who frequently swap \njobs as being less likely to engage in organizational citizenship. They also argue \nthat the post Enron effect is reducing levels of organizational trust and thus \ndiminishes a willingness to widen participation. Most fundamentally however, \nthe drivers for enhanced organizational democracy appear at odds with the \ndominant bureaucratic and unitary model of organizing described here. \n \nSuch a focus is inevitably in tension with the apparent move toward distributed \nmodels of managing, where agents are increasingly required to work with varied \nand competing interests. In this model, leaders are held responsible for \ncollective outcomes, but through individual agency (Hales, 1999; Huffington et \nal., 2003; Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2005). This tension heightens \nmanagerial feelings of vulnerability because protective processes and structures \nsuch as traditional lines of authority and accountability become threatened \n(Bennett, et al. 2003; Huffington et al. 2003; Lindgren and W\u00e5hlin, 1999). In \nsuch situations, in order to ensure an ongoing affirmation of self-identity, \nmanagers can assuage their resulting anxieties by more closely adopting the \ndominant bureaucratic logic of rationality. Thus, the adoption of pluralistic \nmodels of managing can be curtailed by a logic that actively \u2018rationalises\u2019 \nattempts to address the issue (Hales, 1999; Clarke, 2006).  \n \nThe evidence from some organizations that appear to work effectively with \nthese tensions (See Gratton, 2004) underscores the question posed by \nRousseau and Rivero (2003) as to what sort of behaviours and organizing \nprinciples are required to enable businesses to become more responsive to a \nplurality of stakeholder interests. It is this question which provides the focus for \nthis thesis:-given the dominance of this rational mindset, in what way does \nhierarchy need to be redefined to enable managers to work with a complex \nrange of competing interests; what sort of leadership behaviours might this \n 68\nreconfiguration require; and how, if considered efficacious, might these \nbehaviours be encouraged through management education? In investigating \nissues of unity and plurality, coherence and difference, efficiency and \ninnovation, this research is very much concerned with issues of organizational \ngovernance. Ultimately, how these tensions are managed reflects values about \ndemocracy in the workplace.  \n \nThis focus is made more acute for me inasmuch as in considering these issues \nover the last ten years I have worked with hundreds of managers from most \nparts of the world; all of them share, to some degree, a frustration about how \nthey can make sense of an increasingly complex and demanding business \nworld, and work effectively within these conditions in a way that enhances their \nindividual autonomy. Thus, this body of work, at its heart, has an emancipatory \nagenda.  \n \nThe publications detailed in this synoptic paper contribute to the development of \norganizing principles that business leaders might consider in working with the \ntensions of organizational coherence and plurality. Whilst it is not my intention \nhere to develop yet another theory of leadership, my purpose is to consider the \nvalue of a voluntaristic and institutional leadership lens in understanding how to \nencourage the development of organizational democracy. What appears to \ndistinguish a voluntaristic approach to leading is a disposition which combines; \na facility to work with organised dissonance (Ashcraft, 2001), an irreverent or \nconstructively deviant orientation, political acuity, and a mutuality of goals. On \nthis basis I believe there are four ideas for managers and management \neducators to consider as a result of this collected work. \n \nFirstly, the empirical study found that, despite apparent pressures to close off \nthe contradictions between distributed power and rational organization, some \nmanagers appear able to negotiate this dissonance in a way that encourages a \ndemocratic orientation to leading. Central to this disposition is the \nrepresentation of, and working with, a wide range of constituencies that offer \nvaried opportunities by which to negotiate identity and encourage an affirmation \nof self. That is, these managers conceive their role not purely in terms of \ntreating others as moral equals, but as an activity to further the interests of \nothers, as well as themselves. Contrary to the views of authors such as Cloke \nand Goldsmith (2002) and Gratton (2004) who emphasise the importance of a \nsimilarity between individual and organizational values, democratic behaviour \nhere was facilitated by a disposition in which individuals often saw themselves \nas being independent of the goals\/values of their organization, sometimes \nworking within them but equally at times undermining them. \n \nSecondly, the theorizing and research findings in this study provide greater \ninsight as to the role of organizational politics in democratic activity and lie in \ncontrast to the idea of politics undermining workplace democracy (Rousseau \nand Rivero, 2003) or largely omitted from its discussion (see Gratton 2004). The \norientation of RLs towards politics is supportive of Novicevic and Harvey\u2019s \n(2004) view of organizational politics as a \u201cdemocratic asset\u201d which represents \n 69\nthe varying capacity of employees to influence the way they are governed. The \nuse of political negotiation by RLs seemed to serve as a check and balance \nagainst the undue influence of self-serving interests rather than reinforce them. \nIn the empirical study, this was achieved by behaviours that included \ntransparency of motive, searching for win-win solutions, and openness to \ndialogue.  \n \nThirdly, the research also provides insight as to how this disposition may serve \nto facilitate progress towards more democratic forms in circumstances where \nsuch ambitions are far from being perceived as legitimate. For some authors, \nsuch as Coopey and Burgoyne (2000) this goal is seen as being accelerated \nthrough the establishment of formal systems of political, social and civil rights. \nThis thesis suggests that progress towards democratised forms may also be \nmade through voluntaristic and informal private projects and personal passions \n(Kreiner, 1992): actions that can create pockets of participation, which in turn \nmay act as role models for further action. Specifically, this approach \nemphasises how progress can be made by encouraging voluntary processes of \ngroup formation and identity that do not create untenable chaos. Levels of \ncontrol are still achievable through behaviour that seeks to balance individual \nand organizational agendas. This is supportive of the idea that such voluntaristic \nprinciples can enable informal groups to provide levels of self-control necessary \nfor the maintenance of good governance (Caldart and Ricart, 2004), because \nthese groups, by participating in decision making, express voice about the \nvalues that are important to them (Cludts, 1999). Unofficial groups enable \npeople to pursue individual interests through collective action, thereby creating \na sense of involvement. This disposition is suggestive of Alvesson and Wilmott\u2019s \n(1996:171) theory of \u201cmicro emancipation\u201d, in which individuals are able to \nexploit the \u201cloopholes and contradictions\u201d of rational organizations in order to \nsecure greater personal autonomy.  \n \nFinally, whilst there are many factors that might encourage ML professionals to \npursue a voluntaristic agenda within their own organization development \nagenda, perhaps B Schools provide the richest source of potential change. The \nconditions are increasingly conducive to demand relevance from business \nschools, and ML professionals are organizationally well placed to provide this. \nThe majority of reformist ML research focuses on promoting AE values in \nmanagement education in undergraduate and graduate settings. I argue here \nthat progress might also be made through OEE programmes that offer \nopportunities for: experimentation, B school income and protected environments \nfor development. Exploiting these opportunities may well require management \neducators to become the leaders they seek to create (Gentile and Samuelson, \n2005); representative leadership might provide one approach to meeting this \nagenda. \n \n6.2 Potential Limitations and Further Research \n \nClearly a work of this nature can only ever provide an incomplete picture, and \nespecially when viewed from epistemologically different perspectives has \n 70\nseveral potential shortcomings. These potential limitations are now considered \nbelow as areas for further research. \n \nOrganizational Benefits \nThe empirical research here focussed on examining the structuration of \nrelationships between organization context, managerial cognition and RL \nbehaviour outlined in Figure 3. The model of voluntarism constructed in this \nthesis concludes with some substantive ideas about the relationship between \nthis leadership behaviour and its impact on organizational democracy. However, \nmuch of the material used to explore the organizational performance benefits \naccruing from a voluntaristic approach to managing draws on other research \nfrom the co-evolutionary and complexity discourse, particularly from the work of \nBoisot and Child (1999), Ashmos et al. (2000, 2002), Galunic and Eisenhardt \n(2001), Denis et al (1996, 2001) and Ravasi and Verona (2001). Whilst one can \nfind strong linkages between RL and these studies, they obviously do not \nspecifically deal with RL as described here. \n \nAn obvious focus for further research then is to explore the linkages between \nRL behaviour and organization outcomes. For example; to what extent might a \nvoluntaristic approach enhance flexibility, and innovation? To what extent does \nvoluntarism enhance communication between groups or create untenable silos? \nTo what extent do individuals believe that a voluntaristic approach generates \ngenuine commitment or reduces employee frustrations?  \n \nFinally, if the starting point for this thesis is the increasing plurality of \norganizational life, what might constitute the end point for organizations? The \ndegree to which voluntaristic behaviour might become a legitimate organizing \nprinciple will always be a negotiated process. To some senior managers \nworking in a resource constrained, hyper competitive organizational setting, the \nperceived need for the benefits of voluntarism such as employee participation \nand innovation may be lessened. Other managers in the same organization may \ndisagree. Voluntarism is potentially both the \u2018means and end\u2019 for this debate: \nthe process through which to have such discussion and a way of reconfiguring \nhierarchy to legitimise such discussion. Thus, whilst not suggesting that \nvoluntarism should become an acknowledged universal principle of organizing, I \ndo argue (in section 3.2) that given the inherent tension between organizational \nplurality and hierarchy, coherence and diversity, there is always likely to be \nsome kind of voluntaristic behaviour at play that will serve to mediate between \nthese conflicting requirements. As with the democratic context from which it is \nderived, voluntarism will always be a matter of degree. \n \nResearch Methodology \nThe multiple case methodology was chosen to permit an insight into the extent \nand nature of RL behaviour in different contexts. A case strategy fits well within \na Giddensian approach as it allows for a focus on how individuals make sense \nof, and understand their environment (Easterby-Smith et al., 2002). A level of \ntriangulation, perhaps more typical to a relativist orientation was added to the \nresearch design to gain an insight as to how individual behaviour was perceived \n 71\nby others. Nevertheless, it is recognised that my own knowledge and \nperceptions influenced the research design and framed the content and \ndirection of the interview and analysis process. The output is therefore a joint \noutcome of sense making by myself and those researched (Watson, 2003). In \ndoing so, as Giddens points out, we should not underestimate an actor\u2019s depth \nof understanding of and degree of fluency with their own actions: \u201cactors are \nordinarily able to discursively describe what they do and their reasons for doing \nit\u201d (1984: 281). Nor is there any \u201cmechanism of social organization \u2026\u2026which \nactors cannot get to know about and actively incorporate into what they do\u201d \n(1984: 284). The focus of the research was to surface the unconscious beliefs \n(motivations) guiding such action. \n \nThe use of multiple case studies at a fixed point in time, however, can only \nprovide a snapshot of each organization and how individuals understood and \nreconstituted their environment. A longitudinal case in one organization would \nallow for a more in-depth and richer analysis of the interaction between \nstructure and agency over time. For example, to what extent does the irreverent \nbehaviour of RLs become reconstituted as quasi legitimate activity? At what \n\u2018tipping point\u2019, if at all, does such behaviour become recognised as acceptable?  \n \nCase studies too are limited by their dependence upon retrospective accounts \nand sample size, such that generalisability to other populations is restricted. \nOpportunities for extending this generalisability are elucidated below. Despite \nthese potential shortcomings, a case methodology provides a well accepted \napproach to understanding phenomena within its context (Harrison, 2002) and \nhas been successfully applied by others working from a Giddensian perspective \n(see for example, Coopey et al., 2002). \n \nWidening the Research Base to Different Populations \nThe main empirical study here focussed on senior managers in UK commercial \norganizations. This limits the potential generalisability of the work unless \nreplicated in other settings (Giddens, 1984:328). For example the RL behaviour \ndescribed could merely be a function of experience and maturity in senior roles. \nThe sample was restricted to UK organizations and may reflect national \ncharacteristics. It is interesting to note that RL behaviours might be considered \nreflective of Swedish managerial values of cooperation and interdependence \nbut perhaps untypical of Anglo-American styles of managing (Lindkvist and \nLlewellyn, 2003). Does this suggest, in the face of increasing social pressure for \norganizational democratisation, that Scandinavian management approaches, \nrichly informed by a tradition of social democracy, may, in the future, have more \nsalience for UK managers? Would managers working from a collectivist \norientation reflect different behaviours and cognitions of their context? \n \nThe sample was also exclusively focussed on managers in commercial \ncorporate environments. Research in alternative contexts may produce different \nresults. For example public sector management is increasingly characterised by \nthe notion of community governance (Hartley, 2002) where managers are \nrequired to represent the needs of whole and diverse communities through an \n 72\nopen, flexible and networked pattern of decision making reflective of RL. The \nresearch by Denis et al., (2001) in the pluralist setting of health care is also \nsupportive of the findings here. Might a greater proportion of managers reflect \nRL behaviours in this environment or might this group demonstrate \nadditional\/different cognitive drivers, given their public service orientation? \n \nAdditional studies might be undertaken in other industries\/businesses. For \nexample, are RL behaviours more likely in younger hi-tech industries where \nmore devolved organizational forms tend to be prevalent? Alternatively, would \nmore traditional mature businesses that might place greater emphasis on \nrational approaches to organizing, reflect less RL behaviour or different ways of \nmanaging politics?  \n \n6.3 Conclusion \n \nFrom a structuration perspective, encouraging the individual and local actions \ndiscussed here may play a part in the gradual renegotiation of existing \ninstitutionalised approaches to hierarchy. Whilst individual and isolated group \nagendas appear insignificant, in the context of one organisation or one business \nschool they provide a point of departure in legitimising alternatives. They can \ninitiate change precisely because they are real and relevant to the challenges of \neveryday work (Alvesson and Willmott, 1996). Whilst progress towards \ndemocracy can be made by exploiting the loopholes and contradictions of the \nrational mindset from within, in terms of creating a wholesale shift in \norganizational democratisation, it is a gradual process. The rational model has \nproven to be relatively impervious to short term pressures to evolve and thus \nthe modest contribution to knowledge reflected in this thesis can only be viewed \nas one exceedingly small part of a larger and more fundamental debate about \nthe future of corporate governance in new organizational forms (see Child, \n2005).                                                                                                                                               \n \nThat said, it is important to stress that rational organizing has guided managerial \nvalues for at least two centuries, if not much longer, yet in the last 20 years \nthere has been serious debate and experimentation with new organizing \nprinciples. As with any large scale social change, the evolution discussed here \nhas to be seen as the beginning of a process that has the potential to \naccelerate. On a more optimistic note, then, genuine organisational \ndemocratisation may be closer than its painstakingly slow emergence suggests.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 73\n \nReferences \n \nAdler, P.
