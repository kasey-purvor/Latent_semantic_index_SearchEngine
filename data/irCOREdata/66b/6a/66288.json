Background\n[2] For some time it has been hypothesized that an\nimportant mode of seafloor spreading at slow-\nspreading ridges is asymmetric extension along\nlong lasting, possibly low-angle, normal \u2018\u2018detach-\nment\u2019\u2019 faults [Karson, 1990; Lagabrielle et al.,\n1998]. Such faults may expose the lower crust or\neven upper mantle [Tucholke et al., 1997]. One\nschool of thought is that they alternate with epi-\nsodes of roughly symmetric, predominantly \u2018\u2018mag-\nmatic\u2019\u2019 extension [Tucholke et al., 1997; Varga and\nMoores, 1990], on a timescale of several million\nyears, but a contrasting view is that such faulting\nmay be a more-or-less continuous aspect of plate\nseparation in regions of permanently low magma\nsupply [Cannat and Casey, 1995; Lagabrielle et\nal., 1998].\n[3] Approximately 22 such features have been\nrecognized to date on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge\n(MAR) [Cann et al., 1997; Fujiwara et al., 2003;\nReston et al., 2002; Tucholke et al., 1998a]. Their\nrecognition was based on sea-surface multibeam\nbathymetry data, which usually show a character-\nistic doming of the seafloor together with small-\nscale topographic corrugations lineated parallel to\nthe spreading direction (\u2018\u2018mullions\u2019\u2019), and often\nnarrow valleys at the \u2018\u2018breakaway\u2019\u2019 (the point on\nthe footwall where the fault began) and the \u2018\u2018ter-\nmination\u2019\u2019 (the point on the hanging wall where it\nended). Cann et al. [1997] imaged two such\nfeatures at the Atlantis Transform on the MAR,\nusing Southampton Oceanography Centre\u2019s TOBI\ndeep-towed side-scan sonar. They imaged stria-\ntions parallel to the spreading direction and sug-\ngested that these represent alternating outcrops and\nsediment-filled grooves. Those corrugated domes\nthat have been sampled are mostly associated with\ngabbros or serpentinised peridotites and basalts.\nThese observations suggested that the features may\nbe \u2018\u2018oceanic core complexes\u2019\u2019 analogous to the\nmetamorphic core complexes exposed by low\nangle normal faulting in the western USA [Davis,\n1987; Lister and Davis, 1989]. Domed corrugated\nsurfaces near present-day ridges have thus been\ninterpreted as the fossil footwalls of former detach-\nment faults and have been termed \u2018\u2018megamullions\u2019\u2019\n[Tucholke, 1997]. If such detachments expose\nlower crust or upper mantle, they provide an\nimportant opportunity to directly study the lithol-\nogy and structure of this part of the young oceanic\nlithosphere, together with the tectonic and mag-\nmatic processes that were associated with its for-\nmation and evolution.\n[4] A few oceanic megamullions have now been\ninvestigated by submersible [Karson, 1998;\nMatsumoto et al., 1998; Tucholke et al., 2001]\nand one has been extensively sampled using a wire\nline rock drill [MacLeod et al., 2002]. This last\nstudy successfully demonstrated for the first time\nthat the dome\u2019s corrugated surface was indeed a\nformer detachment fault surface: drilled samples\nare fault rocks with low-angle shear planes and\nhighly deformed greenschist facies assemblages.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 searle et al.: fuji dome 10.1029\/2003GC000519\n2 of 25\n[5] Known examples of oceanic megamullions are\nall low-angle and some even dip away from the\nspreading axis. However, the attitude of the de-\ntachment faults at depth and while active is\nunknown: competing hypotheses predict either a\ncontinuing shallow dip below the surface [Karson,\n1990; Varga and Moores, 1990], or a steeply\ndipping fault plane that subsequently rotates\nover a hinge [Lavier et al., 1999; Shemenda and\nGrocholsky, 1994; Tucholke and Lin, 1994]. In the\nlatter case, significant (approaching 90\u0001) rotation\nmust occur during fault movement. Buck [1988]\npresented a model in which large rotations can be\nachieved by repeated small tilts on a succession of\nhigh-angle faults, which may fit continental [Lister\nand Davis, 1989], ophiolite [Varga and Moores,\n1990] and some mid-ocean ridge cases [Karson,\n1990] where there is evidence of multiple high-\nangle and low-angle faulting. Buck\u2019s model also\npredicts a high flexural rotation and steep dip on\nthe hanging wall of the detachment. Subsequently,\nLavier et al. [1999] have produced numerical\nmodels of extension in oceanic lithosphere, showing\nthat under conditions that promote strain localiza-\ntion and softening, detachment faults can form,\nrotating the footwall through large angles so that\nthe upper part of the fault plane can dip away from\nthe spreading centre. Determining the geometry and\nrotation of the fault plane during the formation of\nmega-mullions is vital for a detailed understanding\nof how oceanic lithosphere extends.\n[6] Another aspect of megamullion formation that\nneeds further study is that, although slow spread\noceanic lithosphere shows widespread evidence for\nextensive normal faulting and the exposure of\ndeeply derived rocks (gabbros and peridotites),\nmegamullions are rather infrequently observed\n[Tucholke et al., 1998a]. Tucholke et al. [2003]\npropose that very long-lasting and large offset faults\nthat lead to the formation ofmegamullions only form\nunder conditions where there is a delicate balance\nbetween magma supply and tectonic extension.\n[7] In October 1997 we carried out a TOBI\nsurvey on the very slow spreading (half rate\n7 km Ma\u00011) southwest Indian Ridge during the\nFUJI (France-UK-Japan-InterRidge) cruise [Me\u00b4vel\net al., 1997a; Me\u00b4vel et al., 1998], during the\ncourse of which we serendipitously imaged a\npreviously unknown detachment in its entirety\n(Figures 1 and 2). We have named this feature\nthe FUJI Dome. It was subsequently the target of\nthree dives with the manned submersible Shinkai\n6500 during the Indoyo cruise in September\u2013\nOctober 1998 (Figure 3) [Fujimoto et al., 1998;\nFujimoto et al., 1999]. Here we report our findings.\n2. Data\n[8] The 1997 FUJI cruise was dedicated to a TOBI\nsurvey. The TOBI deep-towed instrument\n[Flewellen et al., 1993] carried 30 kHz side-scan\nsonar with nominal horizontal resolution of 6 m\nand swath width of 6 km, phase bathymetry with\nsimilar resolution horizontally and vertically, and\nthree-component magnetometer. The tow-ship,\nMarion Dusfresne, deployed a Thomson multi-\nbeam echo sounder and proton magnetometer.\nThe TOBI side scan worked well, but its swath\nbathymetry phase data were very noisy and have\nproved of limited value. The TOBI magnetometer\nbroke down earlier in the cruise, and despite an\nattempted on-board repair, we have not been able\nto recover trustworthy data from it. This was the\nfirst cruise on the Marion Dusfresne of the Thom-\nson echo sounder, which had significant teething\nproblems and also produced relatively noisy data.\nFinally, the Marion Dusfresne\u2019s magnetometer was\nout of action for much of the FUJI Dome survey.\n[9] The Indoyo cruise of R\/V Yokosuka deployed a\nSeaBeam 2000multibeam, together with gravimeter\nand proton magnetometer, all of which were used to\nsurvey off-axis during nighttime, and produced\ngood data. Gravity data were tied to a base station\nin Port Louis, Mauritius, and magnetic data were\nreduced to the IGRF. We have supplemented the\nmultibeam bathymetry with earlier data obtained\nover the ridge axis by the French CAPSING and\nGALLIENI cruises [Patriat et al., 1996].\n[10] The main objective of the Indoyo cruise was a\ndiving program with the manned submersible\nShinkai 6500. Three of the dives (numbers 444,\n445 and 450) were dedicated to the FUJI Dome\n(Figure 3). All of them carried out visual observa-\ntions, made continuous video and still camera\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 searle et al.: fuji dome 10.1029\/2003GC000519\n3 of 25\nrecordings, and collected rock and sediment sam-\nples (Table 1). Gravity was measured within the\nsubmersible at one station on each dive, using a\nLacoste & Romberg Geodetic meter G-1039 tied to\na base station in Port Louis (Table 2).\n3. Regional Setting\n[11] The spreading segment within which the FUJI\nDome lies was covered by a detailed TOBI survey\nwhich will be reported elsewhere [Bralee, 2003\nand A. V. Bralee, MS in preparation]. Interpretation\nof this survey revealed a typical volcanic terrain\nflanking a well-developed axial volcanic ridge\n(AVR) which culminates in the large volcanic\nmassif of Mont Jourdanne at 27\u0001520S, 63\u0001550E\n(Figure 1) [Bralee, 2003;Me\u00b4vel et al., 1998; Searle\net al., 1998b]. This volcanic terrain tapers to the\nwest, suggesting that the tip of the AVR (though\nnot necessarily the tectonic boundary of the seg-\nFigure 1.

It now abuts a large escarpment that\nforms the NW flank of the adjacent non-transform\ndiscontinuity (NTD) near 63\u0001380E (Figure 1). FUJI\nDome lies some 20 km south of the AVR and east\nof the NE-SW trending NTD, and is thus in an\ninside corner position. Six dredges have been\nreported from the area, though none was from the\nFigure 3. (a) Detailed bathymetry over the area of the Shinkai dives. Contour interval 20 m.

The eastern end coincides\nwith a \u2018\u2018turtle-back\u2019\u2019 dome 15 km long, 10 km\nwide and 1500 m high such as is characteristic of\ndetachments at the MAR and on continents\n[Tucholke et al., 1997]. Here the detachment is\ncharacterized by a smooth-looking surface with\nstrong N-S lineations visible in the side-scan im-\nage, cross-cut in places by minor faulting, and\nbounded to north and south by sharply-edged\nblocks of volcanic terrain (Figures 2 and 3).\n[15] On the basis of the side scan image, the\nsmooth surface continues west to about 63\u0001370E,\nwith further N-S lineations near 63\u0001400E. To the\nnorth, south and east the detachment is bounded by\ntypical hummocky volcanic terrain, but in the west\nit merges into what has elsewhere been called\n\u2018\u2018basement\u2019\u2019 terrain and has been suggested to be\nlower crust or upper mantle [Blackman et al., 1998;\nCann et al., 1997; Parson et al., 2000]. This terrain\nis characterized by short, curving lineaments with a\nvariety of trends, and showing both strong reflec-\ntions and narrow shadows, suggesting steep ridges\nand valleys or scarps.\n[16] Our interpretation of the western edge of the\ndetachment (Figure 2) places it part way along a\nsecond, smaller topographic dome centered at\n63\u0001360E). Oceanic detachments are commonly as-\nsociated with pairs of domes along strike\n[MacLeod et al., 2002; Tucholke et al., 2001], so\nwe carefully examined this second dome to see if it\nis an integral part of the detachment. Its crest is\npoorly imaged under TOBI\u2019s nadir, but its western\nflank is certainly characterized by the typical\n\u2018\u2018basement\u2019\u2019 terrain and does not have spreading-\nparallel striations (Figure 3).\n[17] The surfaces of most oceanic megamullions\nappear to be truncated by a ridge or series of\nridges and valleys inferred to coincide with the\nbreakaway - i.e., the point on the footwall where\nthe detachment begins [e.g., MacLeod et al., 2002;\nRanero and Reston, 1999; Reston et al., 2002;\nTucholke et al., 1998a; Tucholke et al., 2001]. In\nthe model of Tucholke et al. [1998a], the break-\naway is at a normal fault which subsequently\ncontinued slipping for much longer than usual.\nLavier et al. [1999]\u2019s numerical model shows that\nthe lithosphere below the detachment rotates sig-\nnificantly away from the ridge, producing an\nupstanding dome, with the top of the initial\nnormal fault becoming a sharp ridge on the older\nside of the dome having a steep slope facing the\nspreading axis. The FUJI Dome has a similar\nshape to these other observed and modeled\ndetachments, with the broad dome bounded to\nthe south by a sharp valley and ridge (Figures 1,\n2a, and 4). The valley axis is at 28\u000103.50S in the\nregion of our dives at 63\u0001450E (Figure 3a), and the\nside scan suggests that its southern flank is a north-\nfacing normal fault, whose top (at 28\u000103.60S) we\ninterpret as the breakaway. A bathymetric profile\nthrough the FUJI Dome (Figure 4) suggests the\npossibility of the breakaway being at the crest of\nthe small ridge at 28\u000105.50S (\u000128.09\u0001) rather than\n28\u000103.60S as suggested above. We cannot com-\npletely rule out this interpretation, but we favor\nthe more northerly position because both the\nshaded bathymetry and the TOBI side scan sug-\ngest that the 28\u000103.50S valley is the southern\nTable 2.

The short, closely-spaced,\nroughly N-S lineaments associated with the two\nnormal fault scarps flanking this valley are features\nsuch as spurs, gulleys and talus chutes associated\nwith mass wasting of the scarps, such as have been\nclearly imaged by TOBI on numerous normal fault\nscarps not associated with detachments [Allerton et\nal., 1995; McAllister and Cann, 1996; Searle et\nal., 1998a]. Immediately south of the 28\u000103.50S\nvalley, TOBI shows a large expanse of hummocky\nvolcanic seafloor extending as far south as\n28\u0001050S. If the breakaway is at 28\u000105.50S, then\nthis must represent a large allocthonous block\nriding above it.\n[18] The youngest point on the detachment surface,\nwhere it ceases to slip and touches the top of\nthe hanging wall, is called the termination. We\ninterpret this as the clear boundary between the\nflat, lineated terrain of the detachment, and the\nhummocky volcanic terrain to its north (Figures 2\nand 3c). This boundary lies at the foot of a shallow\nE-W valley at 27\u0001590S in the region of Figure 3.\n5. Magnetics\n[19] Total magnetic field anomalies (reduced to\nIGRF) from the Indoyo cruise show a clear central\nanomaly and anomalies 3A (approximately 6 Ma)\nand 5 (approximately 10 Ma) [Bralee and Searle,\n2001; Bralee, 2003; Searle and Bralee, 2001].\nThese anomalies are generally well-correlated\nalong the length of the segment and fit an average\nhalf spreading rate of about 7 km Ma\u00011. Between\nthese a number of peaks and troughs can be seen\nbut are harder to correlate along strike (particularly\non the Antarctic flank) and to date. Note that for\nthis N-S spreading ridge, positive anomalies form\nover the northern and negative anomalies over the\nsouthern boundaries of normally magnetized\nblocks.\n[20] Figure 5 shows a N-S magnetic anomaly\nprofile at 63\u0001450E, together with two simple\nmodels. A small, positive magnetic anomaly occurs\nover the FUJI Dome, peaking about 21 km south of\nthe axis (near 28\u0001020S). This is continuous with\nsimilar anomalies on several profiles away from\nthe detachment toward the segment centre [Bralee\nand Searle, 2001; Bralee, 2003; Searle and Bralee,\n2001]. We interpret this as the positive anomaly\nover the young edge of Chron 2n (see below). Its\nexistence here indicates that the lithosphere\nbeneath the detachment was being magnetized as\nit was unroofed. Depending on the precise lithol-\nogy of the footwall, this presumably occurred\nby thermal remanent magnetization of gabbro or\nperidotite as they cooled during uplift, or by\nchemical remanent magnetization of peridotite dur-\ning serpentinization.\n[21] The first model (Figure 5a) is for a constant\nspreading rate of 7 km Ma\u00011. This model gives a\nsmall positive anomaly near chron C2n as identi-\nfied above. A similar positive anomaly is predicted\nover the old edge of C2n on the north flank, about\n25 km north of the axis. These modeled peaks are\nclose to the observed peaks, but for this constant\nspreading rate model they lie slightly to the north\nof each. The second model (Figure 5b) assumes\nthat from 2.58 Ma (the age of the breakaway on\nthis model) until 1.95 Ma (the age of the termina-\nFigure 4.

However, consider-\ning the generally poor fidelity with which magnetic\nanomalies on the Southwest Indian Ridge record\nfield reversals, we should not rely to much on the\nprecise details of this model.\nFigure 5.

(b) Same as Figure 5a, except that for the interval 2.58 Ma (the age of\nthe breakaway on this model) until 1.95 Ma (the age of the termination) there is reduced crustal accretion on the\nnorthern (African) flank at 3.2 km Ma\u00011, and the rest of the plate separation is taken up by slip at 10.8 km Ma\u00011 on\nthe FUJI Dome detachment, accompanied by magnetization of the footwall as slip occurred. Horizontal axis gives\ndistance north or south of the current spreading axis. Anomaly 2n is labeled.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 searle et al.: fuji dome 10.1029\/2003GC000519\n12 of 25\n[22] Both models in Figure 5 require a strong off-\naxis attenuation of magnetization, from 5 A m\u00011\nfor the Brunhes (0\u20130.7 Ma) to 0.5 A m\u00011 else-\nwhere. This applies to the whole of both modeled\nflanks, not just FUJI Dome. The models also\ngenerally over predict the amplitude on the south\nflank between 8 km and 38 km south of the axis,\nand under predict it on the north flank between\n\u00017 km and \u000128 km. We have not been able to\nmatch these amplitude variations by varying the\nmagnetization in the simple blocks of these mod-\nels, including reduced (and zero) magnetization\nunder FUJI Dome.\n6. Gravity\n[23] The Residual Mantle Bouguer Anomaly\n(RMBA) was calculated from Indoyo data using\nthe method of Parker [1972] and Kuo and Forsyth\n[1988], assuming water, crustal and mantle\ndensities of 1030, 2700 and 3300 kg m\u00013, respec-\ntively and a crustal thickness of 7 km [Bralee,\n2003; Searle and Bralee, 2001]. Use of a multi-\nlayer crust does not significantly change the shape\nof the anomaly.\n[24] Figure 6 shows a N-S profile of the RMBA at\n63\u0001450E. This exhibits a regional increase of some\n40 mGal from the ridge axis near 27\u0001550S to the\nflank around 28\u0001100S which does not occur on\nthe north flank of the ridge, and is not a result of\nthe axial thermal anomaly, which has been\naccounted for. We attribute it to asymmetric crustal\naccretion, with crust on average about 2 km\nthicker on the north flank than the south flank\n[Bralee, 2003; Cannat et al., 2003; Searle and\nBralee, 2001]. Superimposed on this regional\ntrend is a peak of about 30 mGal situated over\nFUJI Dome. The gradients on the flanks of this\nanomaly are about 2.9 mGal km\u00011 to the north and\n4.0 mGal km\u00011 to the south. This anomaly is about\n50% larger, and the gradients more than double,\nthose reported over Dante\u2019s Domes, (20 mGal and\n1.3 mGal km\u00011, [Tucholke et al., 2001]).\n[25] The seafloor gravity data were calculated\nusing the methodology of Luyendyk [1984] and\nTucholke et al. [2001]. The Fourier transform\nmethod used to calculate the sea-surface RMBA\nresults in the anomaly having an arbitrary datum,\nso its absolute difference from the seafloor anom-\naly is unknown. In Figure 6 the three seafloor\nanomalies are plotted with their mean matching\nthe mean of the corresponding sea surface values.\nIn modeling the gravity, we have therefore attemp-\nted to match the shape and gradients of both the sea\nsurface and the seafloor anomalies, but not their\nabsolute values.\n[26] The seafloor anomalies reflect the gravity\npeak seen in the sea surface data, but with\nsteeper flanks, as was also found at Dante\u2019s\nDomes on the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge\n[Tucholke et al., 2001]. Observational errors are\nestimated at approximately 0.5 mGal, and the\nonly other large error, in the terrain correction,\nis estimated at a maximum of about 2 mGal for\nthe station on dive 444. These data yield a\nmaximum gradient of 7 mGal km\u00011 to the north\nbetween stations 450-5 and 445-2, compared to\napproximately 3 mGal km\u00011 on both flanks of\nDante\u2019s Domes. The Bouguer anomalies at stations\n444-6 and 450-5 are very similar; we did not make a\nmeasurement far enough south to see if there is a\nstrong gradient away from the dome crest as at\nDante\u2019s Domes.\n[27] We have modeled both the sea-surface and\nseafloor Bouguer anomalies. Since we lack\nadditional constraints (e.g., seismic) or extensive\nseafloor gravity observations, we have avoided\nseeking detailed \u2018\u2018best fit\u2019\u2019 models, and instead\nuse the modeling to provide some constraints on\ngeneric models. This allows us to make a number\nof fairly robust statements:\n[28] 1. First, there must be substantially thinner or\ndenser than normal crust under the FUJI Dome. A\nmodel such as Tucholke et al. [2001] derived for\nDante\u2019s Domes, in which gabbro outcrops across\nthe Dome and the moho is raised 1 km except for\na narrow peridotite dome grossly underestimate\nthe observed sea-surface gravity (maximum misfit\n15 mGal).\n[29] 2. On the other hand, uniformly outcropping,\nunserpentinized peridotite across the Dome signif-\nicantly overestimates the sea-surface gravity by\nabout 15 mGal.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 searle et al.: fuji dome 10.1029\/2003GC000519\n13 of 25\nFigure 6.

Upper solid line:\nResidual Mantle Bouguer Anomaly calculated from Indoyo shipboard data using the method of Parker [1972] and\nKuo and Forsyth [1988], assuming water, crustal and mantle densities of 1030, 2700 and 3300 kg m\u00013, respectively\nand a crustal thickness of 7 km. A linear regional gradient of 0.55 mGal km\u00011 down to the north has been removed.\nInset: RMBA calculated from seafloor gravity observations made in the submersible Shinkai 6500 using the method\nof Luyendyk [1984] and Tucholke et al. [2001], with terrain corrections out to Hammer zone M (21.9 km) [Hammer,\n1939], after setting the mean of observed and calculated anomalies equal. The absolute difference between the\nshipboard and seafloor RMBA is uncertain because of the arbitrary datum involved in the Fourier transform\ncalculation used in the shipboard case, so the absolute values of the gravity scales are arbitrary. Dashed red lines:\nBouguer anomaly calculated from the crustal density model shown below, which is based on the structure obtained by\nnumerical modeling of Lavier et al. [1999]. (b) Observed sea-surface RMBA (with no regional removed) and an\napproximation to a \u2018\u2018best fit\u2019\u2019 model achieved by setting an approximately uniform upper layer to the Dome, and\nadjusting the lateral boundaries of the 3300 kg m\u00013 body to fit the anomaly over the Dome, and the crustal thickness\nto match the regional gradient. Inset shows seafloor data as for Figure 6a. See text for further details.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 searle et al.: fuji dome 10.1029\/2003GC000519\n14 of 25\n[30] 3. The observed seafloor gravity gradients are\nnot consistent with any model that has substantial\nshallow horizontal density contrasts on the Dome\n(e.g., juxtaposed gabbro against either peridotite or\nbasalt), although such models can reproduce our\nobserved sea surface gravity anomalies.\n[31] 4. Without the help of further constraints on\ncrustal thickness and density, it is difficult to\nconstrain the dip of the buried detachment north\nof the termination.\n[32] We explored a number of gravity models\nbased on the structure obtained in the final step\nof the numerical modeling of Lavier et al.\n[1999] (Figure 6a). These models assume a\nlayered crust with 2 km of basalt\/diorite (density\n2700 kg m\u00013) overlying 5 km of gabbro (den-\nsity 2900 kg m\u00013) with a peridotite mantle of\ndensity 3300 kg m\u00013. In Lavier et al. [1999]\u2019s\nmodel, slip on the detachment combined with\nisostatic forces and bending moments cause the\nfootwall to rise and bend upward, tilting out-\nward, away from the ridge axis. As it does so, a\nwedge of mantle rises beneath it. We modeled\nthis by tilting the 2700 kg m\u00013 and 2900 kg m\u00013\ncrustal layers up under the southern part of the\nDome and breakaway region, and replacing them\nby a 3300 kg m\u00013 wedge under its northern part.\nModels such as this (e.g., Figure 6a) can provide a\ngood fit to the sea-surface data, but because of the\nshallow lateral density contrasts they do not fit the\nseafloor data well (maximum misfit 28 mGal for\nmodel in Figure 6a). The model in Figure 6a\nassumes the breakaway is at 28\u00013.50S. If we place\nthe breakaway, and thus the outcrop of the gabbro-\nperidotite contact, farther south, then the seafloor\ndata can be well fitted but the sea surface anomaly\nis overestimated because now the whole of the\ndome is underlain by peridotite. Figure 6b shows\nan approximation to a \u2018\u2018best fit\u2019\u2019 model. This model\nis loosely based on that of Figure 6a, but has a\nmore extensive, approximately 2 km thick, 2900\nkg km\u00013 layer over the dome to try to fit the\nseafloor gradients. We then adjusted the lateral\nextent of the 3300 kg m\u00013 body to best fit the\nseafloor data over the Dome, and finally adjusted\nthe crustal thickness to approximately match the\nregional gradient. The calculated and observed\nsea-surface anomalies are everywhere within\n\u00b15 mGal of each other. After adjusting the mean\nof the observed seafloor anomaly to the mean of\nthe calculated anomaly, the maximum misfit in\nthe seafloor data is 19 mGal. The fit could\ndoubtless be improved by ad-hoc adjustments to\nthe layer densities and thicknesses. While recog-\nnizing that this, as any gravity model, is highly\nnon-unique, we suggest that it illustrates the major\nfeatures of the density distribution that must exist\nhere, i.e., a crust thinning from north to south, a\nhigh density intrusion under the dome (which is\ntherefore at least partly dynamically supported),\nand a fairly constant density lithology in its upper\npart.\n[33] We cannot directly infer lithology from the\nmodel densities. Although densities of 2700 kg\nm\u00013, 2900 kg m\u00013, and 3300 kg m\u00013 would be\nappropriate for basalt, gabbro and peridotite,\nrespectively, it is important to remember that\nserpentinized peridotite can have significantly\nlower density, depending on the degree of serpen-\ntinization, and may have similar density to gabbro.\nWe also recognize that, at this segment-end loca-\ntion on a very slow spreading ridge, the \u2018\u2018crust\u2019\u2019\nmay well not have a simply layered structure but\ncould be a quite heterogeneous mixture of gabbro\nand peridotite with varying degrees of serpentini-\nzation [Cannat, 1996].\n7. Submersible Dives\n[34] The positions of the three dives conducted on\nthe FUJI Dome (numbers 444, 445 and 450) are\nshown on Figure 3, and depth profiles of each dive,\nannotated with geological observations, are shown\nin Figure 7.\n7.1. Detachment Boundaries\n[35] The detachment surface represents a distinct\nformation that is different from those adjacent to\nit to the north and south. North of the termina-\ntion (northern boundary of the Dome) there is a\nvolcanic ridge (visited at the start of dive 445,\nFigure 7b) composed of moderately old but\nclearly identifiable pillow basalts and tubes,\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 searle et al.: fuji dome 10.1029\/2003GC000519\n15 of 25\nmany of which are unbroken and in situ. Sample\n445-R1 from here is a piece of slightly altered\naphyric basaltic lava tube (Table 1). This ridge\nhas all the appearances of normal volcanic sea-\nfloor. Generally, the orientations of the pillows\nindicate that only minor tilting has occurred since\neruption. In one place, a large in situ drained\npillow exposed drainage sills indicating that it\nhas tilted about 10\u0001 to the south. No evidence\nwas seen for more extreme tilts. The termination\nitself is marked by a narrow, sedimented valley\nthat separates the volcanic ridge to the north\nfrom the detachment surface to the south. No\nfault contact was visible.\n[36] South of the detachment, on the ridge whose\ncrest we interpret as the breakaway (visited on dive\n444, Figure 7a), there are also intact and probably\nin situ pillows and tubes, although there is a\nslightly greater proportion of broken pillows and\npillow talus than at the termination. The faulted\nnorthern flank of this ridge, which we interpret as\nFigure 7. Depth profiles of dives (a) 444, (b) 445 and (c) 450, respectively, with geological interpretations and\nstation positions.

Detachment Surface\n7.2.1. Southern Slope (Dive 444)\n[37] In terms of structure, the southern slope of the\ndome is a steep wall that appears to be a fault\nsurface, at least near its foot: it dips at about 45\u0001\nto the south, exposes some foliated or schistose\nrocks (unsampled) at its base, and just above these\n(2792 m, Figure 7a) has an apparent intrusive body\nwhose upper surface is planar, dips 30\u0001 or more to\nthe south and displays N-S oriented slickensides. At\n2795 m, what appears to be a thin lava flow or sill\ndips 40\u0001S, and nearby are some possible small\ndykes dipping about 30\u0001N. If the sill and dykes\nwere originally horizontal and vertical, respectively,\nthey have been rotated 30\u0001\u201340\u0001 away from the\nridge axis.\n[38] Much of the steep south slope of the dome\ndisplays a groove-and-spur structure trending down\nslope with several meters of often sharp relief. We\nsuggest that this corresponds to the localized stria-\ntions seen on this fault scarp on the side scan image\n(Figure 3) and interpret it as a product of mass-\nwasting. Apart from the fairly rare, probably in situ\nrocks described above, the steep south slope is\nmostly covered by debris flow deposits (angular to\nrounded clasts of presumed igneous rock with\nvarying proportions of sediment matrix from 0 to\n>50%) which grade into semi-consolidated brec-\ncias, with occasional outcrops of more massive-\nlooking rock, often fractured but some probably in\nsitu (Figure 7a). Sampled clasts are aphyric and\naltered aphyric basalts (Table 1).\n[39] The upper part of the south slope above\n2600 m becomes less steep, with an increasing\nproportion of completely sedimented (often rippled)\nseafloor toward the summit of the dome (Figure 7a).\nBrecciated rocks continue between patches of\nsediment, and range between a) continuous, flat-\nlying surfaces of small, angular boulders,\nb) scattered deposits of mixed size, c) sometimes\nrounded boulders, and d) occasional very large\n(decametre) massive deposits. The latter were\nthought to be possibly in situ outcrops.\n[40] Sampling of one massive outcrop at station 4\n(2545 m, samples 444-R16 to 444-R20, Table 1)\nrevealed a glassy breccia of welded fragments of\npillow or other lava, while another near the summit\n(station 5, 2440 m, Figures 3, 7a) was revealed to\nbe a breccia, from which altered aphyric basalt\n(444-R22), microtroctolite (444-R21) and micro-\ngabbro (444-R23, 444-R24), and a pale green mud,\nproduced from the disaggregation of a metamor-\nphosed mafic rock, were recovered. Most are\nslightly metamorphosed in the amphibolite to\ngreenschist facies.\n7.2.2. Northern Slope (Dives 445 and 450)\n[41] With one exception (see below), the detach-\nment surface north of the dome\u2019s summit has no\nclear-cut exposures of in situ hard rock. Overall\nsediment cover decreases (from a maximum of\nabout 90% by area), and rubble cover increases,\nsouthward (up-slope) from the termination. On and\nin this sediment are two types of deposit. The first\nconsists of closely spaced, poorly sorted rock clasts\nthat range in size from coarse sand or gravel to\nlarge (>2 m) boulders. Sampled rocks were\nmostly variously altered basalts, although one\nwas a serpentinized harzburgite (450-R08, 2899 m,\nFigures 3 and 7c). All are old with locally over 1 cm\nof manganese oxide crust, and none is in situ. No\nfault rocks (e.g., cataclasites) were found. The\nsecond type of deposit is flat and slabby, less than\na meter high and extending several meters across.\nOne of these was sampled and found to consist of a\nbed of manganese-coated, semi-indurated forami-\nniferal ooze (450-R7, Table 1). Typically both types\nof deposit are tens of meters across and separated\nfrom each other by tens to a few hundreds of\nmeters. The edges of some of the rock deposits\nextend N-S, and they appear similar to the debris\n\u2018\u2018fences\u2019\u2019 described from the Dante\u2019s Domes\n[Tucholke et al., 2001]. It seems unlikely that\nsuch mass-wasting deposits would be sufficiently\ncontinuous to give rise to the striations seen on\nTOBI images, which are straight and coherent\nover many kilometers. However, we were unable\nto test this possibility fully. Most of the detachment\nsurface north of the dome\u2019s summit is very smooth.\nWe have no direct measurement of seafloor depth\nalong the dives (submersible height above bottom\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 searle et al.: fuji dome 10.1029\/2003GC000519\n18 of 25\nwas not available) but plots of submersible depth\nagainst time for dive 450, when the submersible\nwas maintaining an approximately constant height\n(within about \u00b12 m) show apparent variations in\ndepth of \u00035\u201310 m amplitude and \u0003200\u2013500 m\nwavelength superimposed on the regional slope.\nWe suggest these variations may reflect depth\nvariations across the spreading-parallel striations\nseen on TOBI, which have about the same wave-\nlength, although our navigation is too imprecise to\nbe able to match individual features from the depth\nprofile to the side scan image.\n7.3. Minor Faulting (Dive 445)\n[42] Three small west-dipping fault scarps were\nimaged on the north-eastern corner of the detach-\nment by TOBI (dark lineaments around 27\u000159.30S,\n63\u0001460E in Figure 3) and were targeted as likely\nplaces for in situ exposures. Dive 445 crossed the\ntwo eastern scarps at about 1400 m and 1600 m\nfrom the start of the dive (Figures 3 and 7b). These\nscarps are 20\u201325 m high and dip from 20\u0001 to\nvertical. They have no fresh talus below them and\nappear to be inactive. The centre one of the three\nexposed mainly a breccia of igneous clasts in a\nsediment matrix. We climbed the easternmost scarp\nand then followed it along strike to the south\n(Figure 3). It exposed a mixture of sediment-basalt\nbreccia and massive igneous rocks. In the breccia\n(stations 5 and 6, samples 445-R07, 445-R09,\n445-R10), the clasts are variously altered, meta-\nmorphosed (greenschist facies) and mildly tecton-\nized basalts. Samples from one massive igneous\noutcrop (station 4, samples 445-R05 and 445-R06)\nwere fractured meta-basalt (greenschist facies),\nwith sample R05 derived from a pillow lava\nrim, although the pillowed nature of this deposit\nwas not apparent to visual examination from the\nsubmersible. Just below station 4 an apparent\nigneous intrusive feature, possibly a small dyke,\nwas seen but not sampled.\n[43] There is no doubt that this part of the detach-\nment surface, which displays N-S striations on\nTOBI, contains in-situ basalts. They appear old,\nand predate the N-S faulting, which cuts them. All\nare metamorphosed, possibly to greenschist facies,\nunlike most of the rubble samples collected from\nthe detachment surface. However, these basaltic\noutcrops are very different from the small volcanic\ncones erupted on the surface of Dante\u2019s Domes\n[Tucholke et al., 2001], which we did not encounter\non any of our dives.\n[44] These basalts are the only outcrops of clearly\nin situ rock found on the detachment. However,\nit should be noted that this site is separated from\nthe rest of the detachment by a subtle, curved\nlineament on TOBI (starting at 28\u000100.10S on the\neastern edge of Figure 3b, curving NW along the\nsouthern edges of the three N-S faults). This\nprobably marks the edge of a thin sliver parallel\nto the main detachment (an \u2018\u2018excision\u2019\u2019 in the terms\nof Davis and Lister [1988]), so we cannot conclude\nthat the in situ samples are characteristic of the rest\nof the detachment footwall. This sliver may have\ncome from the footwall (in which case at least this\npart of the detachment is floored by basalt), or the\nhanging wall, in which case it tells us nothing\nabout the main detachment. The fact that the N-S\nTOBI striations appear to continue through this\ncurved lineament (Figure 3b) suggests that the\nsliver was intimately involved in the main detach-\nment motion, but with the present data we cannot\nbe entirely sure.\n8. Discussion\n[45] The FUJI Dome detachment is one of very few\nknown examples outside the North Atlantic or\nfrom a cold or very slow-spreading ridge, and is\nalso now one of the best imaged.\n8.1. Corrugations and Striations\n[46] Our multibeam bathymetry data show a\ngrooved or \u2018\u2018mullioned\u2019\u2019 surface, similar to exam-\nples from the MAR [Blackman et al., 1998; Cann\net al., 1997; Fujiwara et al., 2003; Reston et al.,\n2002; Tucholke et al., 1996; 1998a; Tucholke,\n1997]. Cann et al. [1997] suggest that well-devel-\noped corrugations occur only on surfaces near\nridge-transform intersections; our results are con-\nsistent with this. The FUJI Dome shows clear\nstriations on TOBI side scan. On the basis of our\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 searle et al.: fuji dome 10.1029\/2003GC000519\n19 of 25\nobservations, these could be caused by striated\nrubble deposits (although they appear too long\nand continuous for this to be very likely), or by\ntopographic variations in either the sediment sur-\nface or the sediment covered basement, or both\n(which we think most likely but are unable to\ncompletely verify with the present observations).\nHowever, they are not caused by alternating out-\ncrop and sediment as suggested by Cann et al.\n[1997].\n8.2. Lithological Structure\n[47] Very little mid- or lower-crustal or mantle rock\nwas recovered. The only possible in situ outcrops\nare of gabbro and microtroctolite, near the summit\nof the Dome, but given that they were recovered\nfrom a breccia, we cannot be entirely sure that their\nultimate origin was near this site. It is possible,\nthough we think unlikely, that they spalled off the\nhanging wall at some point in the detachment\u2019s\ndevelopment. The rest of the detachment surface is\nquite smooth, sedimented, and strewn with pre-\ndominantly basaltic rubble. This is very similar to\nDante\u2019s Domes [Tucholke et al., 1998b]. However,\nthe origin of this rubble is unclear. At other detach-\nments it has usually been assumed to have spalled\noff the hanging wall or a klippe near the termina-\ntion Tucholke et al. [1998b]. At FUJI Dome the\nareal density of this rubble increases southward\naway from the termination, suggesting either that it\nmay not originate from the hanging wall or, if it\ndoes, that the rate of rubble formation has de-\ncreased over time. The steep southern slope of\nFUJI Dome makes an origin south of there (e.g.,\nsouth of the breakaway) unlikely, as does the\ndistance it would need to be transported along\nwhat was at best a shallow slope to the north. It\nis possible that some of the scattered deposits\nrepresent the remains of barely buried rocks that\nhave disaggregated in situ, although some are\nclearly sitting on top of sediment. It is also possible\nthat significant quantities of basalt outcrop near the\nsummit of the dome. There is no evidence for this\nfrom TOBI side scan in the region of our dives\n(Figure 3), although we have identified areas of\nvolcanic terrain on the detachment near 63\u0001410E\nand 63\u0001480E (Figure 2). We did not, however,\nobserve any of the small volcanic cones observed\non Dante\u2019s Domes [Tucholke et al., 2001].\n[48] Dive 445 recovered the only other in situ\nrocks, which are metabasalts from what we inter-\npret as a thin tectonic sliver or excision lying\nabove the main detachment surface near the termi-\nnation. The metamorphism suggests that the rocks,\nalthough containing pillow basalts, have been\nburied to some depth, in contrast to the basaltic\nrubble from the rest of the detachment surface\nwhich is all unmetamorphosed. This is consistent\nwith the sliver having been unroofed by faulting\nparallel to the main detachment (Figure 4).\n[49] Although we have few in situ samples, our\ngravity modeling suggests that dense and there-\nfore probably lower crustal rocks (gabbro and\/or\nserpentinised peridotite) must be present near the\nsurface of the Dome. We found decametre sized\nblocks near the summit of the dome, where we\nsample gabbro (dive 444). These large blocks are\nthought to be either in situ or else near their\npoint of origin. Our recovery of a peridotite\nboulder implies an outcrop of peridotite also on\nthe Dome.\n[50] The general similarity to Dante\u2019s Domes\nsuggests that this lithological structure may be a\ncommon feature of mid-ocean ridge detachments.\nHowever, it is not consistent with models\n[Tucholke and Lin, 1994] and observations from\nthe Troodos ophiolite [Varga and Moores, 1990]\nwhere the detachment is at the dyke-gabbro\nboundary or exposes continuous gabbro [Karson,\n1990]. We find frequent basaltic rubble and rare\ndykes, gabbro and serpentinite, but no evidence of\na sheeted dyke formation. This perhaps suggests\nthat rather than a \u2018\u2018classical\u2019\u2019 layered crust at the\ndetachment, basalts were erupted directly onto\ngabbro or even serpentinised peridotite with little\nor no sheeted dyke layer, similar to the model of\nCannat et al. [1995] for segment ends.\n8.3. Tectonic Pattern\n[51] Several models of core complexes [Buck,\n1988; Lister and Davis, 1989] show the multiple,\nstacked normal fault blocks lying on the main\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 searle et al.: fuji dome 10.1029\/2003GC000519\n20 of 25\ndetachment with their fault planes dipping at\nshallow angles toward the termination. In these\nmodels, such fault blocks have been strongly\nrotated so that their originally horizontal surfaces\nare almost vertical. We have inferred the exis-\ntence of a thin fault sliver near the breakaway\n(Figure 3). It is possible that this is analogous to\nsuch strongly rotated fault blocks, although we\nhave no evidence to suggest the degree of rota-\ntion here.\n[52] Buck\u2019s [1988] model shows that multiple\nfaulting can weaken the lithosphere and so allow\nit to bend through large angles. In particular, his\nmodel predicts that the hanging wall may \u2018\u2018roll\nover\u2019\u2019 so that its surface dips at large angles toward\nthe footwall (i.e., to the south, away from the ridge\naxis). Our observations of the FUJI hanging wall\nsuggest that it only dips about 10\u0001 to the south,\nwithin the usual range of outward dip of mid-ocean\nridge normal fault blocks [Searle, 1992]. Of\ncourse it is possible that the lavas on which this\nobservation is based were erupted quite late, after\nsignificant hanging wall rotation had occurred, but\nwe see no evidence in either the side scan or\nbathymetry data that such was the case.\n[53] The detachment itself dips at about 20\u0001 near\nthe termination, a relatively shallow angle, like\nmost other oceanic detachments. Our data are\nunable to constrain the dip below the hanging\nwall, where different models predict either con-\ntinued low-angle dip e.g., [Dick et al., 1991] or a\ntransition to a steeply-dipping fault [e.g., Cann et\nal., 1997; Tucholke et al., 1998a]. There is some\nsupport for a low-angle model elsewhere from\ngravity [Blackman et al., 1998] and seismic data\n[Ranero and Reston, 1999]. However, we are\nunable to constrain the subsurface dip at the FUJI\nDome with the available data; in particular, our\ngravity data cannot constrain the dip without\nadditional information on the crustal structure\nhere.\n[54] The south side of FUJI dome (like Dante\u2019s\nDomes) dips steeply (\u000345\u0001) away from the ridge\naxis, so that it has probably flexed through an angle\nof over 50\u0001 during the full history of slip, and is\nlocally down-faulted away from the ridge axis.\nMost models of oceanic detachments suggest that\nthe footwall will have been exhumed from near the\nridge axis where the brittle-ductile transition may\nbe quite shallow, resulting in a very thin elastic\nplate. The footwall may then flex easily in response\nto isostatic forces and bending moments so that its\nsurface dips increasingly away from the ridge axis.\nDoming of the detachment surface might be en-\nhanced by isostatic uplift following unloading\n[Lister and Davis, 1989], although the degree of\nunloading here may be insufficient, and it is not\nclear that this would lead to much larger outward\ndips on the breakaway side of the dome. However,\nMacLeod et al. [2002] have described a detach-\nment on the MAR at 15\u0001450N where there is a well\ndeveloped dome but no evidence of ductile defor-\nmation. They suggest that this detachment might\nroot in a serpentinization front well above the\nbrittle-ductile transition, which would presumably\nyield a much thicker footwall plate. Maximum\nhypocentral depths of microearthquakes [e.g.,\nWolfe et al., 1995] and estimates of effective elastic\nthickness based on lithospheric flexure [e.g., Watts\nand Zhong, 2000] suggest a lithospheric thickness\nof 8\u201312 km at the axes of slow-spreading ridges. It\nmay be therefore that in such cases some other\nmechanism such as extensive faulting reduces the\neffective elastic thickness sufficiently to allow such\nprofound flexure.\n[55] Low density plutons beneath a detachment\n(e.g., gabbro intruded into peridotite) can also\ncause doming [Yin, 1991]. MacLeod et al. [2002]\nand Escartin et al. [2003] found gabbro directly\nunderlying the 15\u0001450N MAR detachment in an\narea of extensive peridotite. However, for such\nplutons to have sufficient buoyancy to drive the\ndoming process, doming would have to occur\nbefore there was extensive serpentinization of the\nsurrounding peridotite, implying that the latter\nwould have to be quite a late-stage process. How-\never, the existence of a positive Bouguer anomaly\nover FUJI Dome would seem to rule out the\npossibility of buoyancy-driven uplift here. Never-\ntheless, whether or not such plutons are sufficiently\nbuoyant to drive or enhance uplift and doming,\nthey may provide strong rheological contrasts.\nThese would tend induce stress concentrations,\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 searle et al.: fuji dome 10.1029\/2003GC000519\n21 of 25\ncausing detachments to nucleate on the boundaries\nof the plutons. If the plutons are stronger than the\nsurrounding peridotite, they could strengthen the\nfootwall of large offset axial faults, and this might\nexplain why megamullions are localized features\nwhereas large offset faults appear to be almost\nubiquitous in inside corner contexts.\n[56] Finally, Tucholke et al. [1998a] have sug-\ngested that oceanic detachments are associated\nwith a lowering in the melt delivery to, and\nmagmatic accretion at, a ridge. We tested this by\nmodeling magnetic anomalies over the FUJI Dome\nand its conjugate seafloor. Although the resolution\nof the sea-surface magnetic anomalies is limited,\nthey are consistent with a model in which there is\nslip at more than the half spreading rate on the\ndetachment, accompanied by diminished (though\nnot zero) magmatic accretion on the conjugate\nflank. This model suggests that the duration of\nactive slip on the detachment was about 1 Ma.\nEven so, the FUJI Dome carries magnetic anoma-\nlies that are continuous with those formed in\npresumed magmatically spread crust nearer the\nsegment centre. This implies that, whatever the\nunderlying lithology, it is capable of acquiring a\nremanent magnetization comparable to that of the\nnormal magnetic source rocks.\n9. Conclusions\n[57] We have discovered and imaged a complete\noceanic core complex and detachment surface on\nthe very slow spreading (7 km Ma\u00011) southwest\nIndian Ridge. The detachment is 20 km south of\nthe ridge axis in the inside corner of a non-\ntransform discontinuity. It is characterized by a\n1500 m high ellipsoidal bathymetric dome (the\nFUJI Dome) and a detachment surface that is seen\nto be grooved or mullioned on shipboard multi-\nbeam bathymetry and striated on deep-towed side-\nscan sonar. These striations do not reflect out-\ncropping basement, but may be shallow topo-\ngraphic ridges and troughs. The detachment\nextends at least 18 km along-axis and about\n8 km across axis.\n[58] A positive magnetic lineation runs continu-\nously through the feature and is continuous with\nthe same anomaly outside the detachment at the\nsegment centre, indicating that the lithosphere\nbeneath the detachment was being magnetized\nduring its formation. We interpret this anomaly\nas the young end of anomaly 2A (approximately\n2.6 Ma). Sea-surface magnetic anomalies have\npoor resolving power at this slow spreading rate,\nbut modeling conjugate anomalies on both flanks\nsuggests that during active slip on the detach-\nment, crustal extension was asymmetric, with\nfaster accretion at about 10.8 km Ma\u00011 on the\nsouth flank (via tectonic extension on the detach-\nment), with slower than normal (3.2 km Ma\u00011)\nmagmatic accretion on the north flank. The mod-\neling suggests that the detachment was active for\nabout 1 Ma.\n[59] Three submersible dives were conducted on\nthe Dome. They confirmed apparently in-situ vol-\ncanic seafloor, with only minor tilting, immediately\nnorth and south of the detachment surface. The\nsouth flank of the Dome dips steeply, up to 45\u0001\naway from the ridge axis, with evidence of 30\u0001\u2013\n40\u0001 outward rotation, is characterized by extensive\nbreccia and mass-wasting deposits, and is locally\ndown faulted to the south. The northern flank dips\ngently (about 11\u0001) to the north and is covered by\nsediment and mostly basaltic rubble. Near the\ntermination a thin sliver appears to lie above the\nmain detachment and is locally broken by minor\nnormal faults. Sampling these fault scarps recov-\nered in situ meta-basalts and basaltic breccias. Our\nonly recoveries of plutonic rocks were samples of\napparently in situ gabbro near the crest of the\nDome and a single serpentinite boulder from the\nnorthern flank.\n[60] Sea-surface gravity anomalies show that the\ndetachment is underlain by thinned or increased\ndensity crust. Seafloor gravity measured at three\npoints on the detachment surface rule out exten-\nsive lateral, shallow density variations, such as\nbasalt-gabbro or gabbro-peridotite contacts. Be-\ncause of this, we have to rule out models in\nwhich a simple layered crust is strongly up\nwarped beneath the Dome with layer 2\/3 or Moho\ncontacts occurring near the surface. In general, the\ngravity best fits a model of the Dome in which\nthe basaltic crust is virtually absent, with gabbro\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 searle et al.: fuji dome 10.1029\/2003GC000519\n22 of 25\nreplacing normal layer 2 and peridotite replacing\nlayer 3.\nAcknowledgments\n[61] The FUJI cruise was funded via InterRidge Japan, the\nEuropean Union, the Natural Environment Research Council\nand the Centre National pour Re\u00b4cherche Scientifique.
