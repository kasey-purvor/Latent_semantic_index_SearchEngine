We argue that there are inherent struc-\ntural characteristics of organisations in each sector (for example, owner-\nship, stakeholders and resources) which predispose them to respond \nmore or less sensitively to different states of \u2018disadvantage\u2019 experienced\nby their users. These states are defined as financial, personal, societal and\ncommunity disadvantage. We suggest that voluntary organisations have\na comparative advantage over other sector agencies in areas where their\ndistinctive ambiguous and hybrid structures enable them to overcome\nproblems of principal\u2013agent gap, median voter reluctance, weak mes-\nsages from politicians to staff and lack of market interest.\nBy taking ideas of comparative advantage into account, a coherent case\ncan be developed regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the expanded\nrole of voluntary agencies in welfare provision. In essence, the article con-\ntends that a diminution in stakeholder ambiguity, resulting from organi-\nsational growth, lowers the comparative advantage of voluntary agencies.\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\nIt has become a clich\u00e9 of modern social policy that we now live in a\nmixed economy of welfare.

Private markets are growing in sophistication and\nscale. What room is there for a third sector and of what kind?\nOur purpose in this paper is to explore whether \u2013 specifically in the\nrealm of human services \u2013 voluntary organisations possess characteris-\ntics which might assure them of possible comparative advantages over\nthe for-profit and public sectors with respect to certain sorts of users. In\nthis exploration we shall attempt to demonstrate that despite claims that\nthe sectors are \u2018blurring\u2019, the sector concept remains a powerful explana-\ntory tool. We shall not argue that any one has a monopoly of the virtues.\nRather our case is that there are inherent \u2018structural\u2019 characteristics of\norganisations in each sector (for example, ownership, stakeholders and\nresources) which predispose them to respond, more or less sensitively, \nto the different states of \u2018disadvantage\u2019 experienced by their users. \nThese states are defined as financial, personal, societal and community\ndisadvantage which can lead individuals and groups to a breakdown \nin independent living.\nThis article is intended to be first, a theoretical exploration designed to\nprovoke debate and secondly, we hope, an attempt to test the validity of\nour exploration.\nD E F I N I T I O N S\nSome preliminary definitions are in order. First, we are not seeking to\nanalyse the contribution of all voluntary organisations. Our prime con-\ncern is with \u2018human services\u2019, that set of welfare agencies which provide\ncare, cash, education, shelter and support to people, very often with sig-\nnificant personal interaction between the agency and the individual\nclient or user (Donovon and Jackson, 1991; Hasenfeld, 1992). The term\nis neutral between the sectors that may provide these services \u2013  private\nfor profit, state or voluntary.\nSecond, there is the very notion of a \u2018sector\u2019 and the term voluntary or\nnon-profit. Although boundary lines are difficult to draw, legally, and in\nterms of the primary stakeholders, there is a very clear difference between\nagencies which are owned by shareholders and have to make a profit and\nthose which do not. There is also a clear difference between an organisa-\ntion set up by statute and responsible to an electorate, and private organi-\nsations that are not. This is not the place to debate this issue at length. We\nrest on the structural\/functional definition of Salamon and Ahneier\n(1992, pp. 10\u201313) which despite some reservations, will suffice as a\nworking definition. That is to say, the voluntary, or what now may \n80 David Billis and Howard Glennerster\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\nincreasingly be called the \u2018third sector\u2019, can be defined as a collection of\norganisations that are (a) formal or institutionalised to some extent; (b) pri-\nvate \u2013 institutionally separate from government; (c) non-profit-distributing\n\u2013 not returning profits generated to their owners; (d) self-governing \u2013\nequipped to control their own activities; (e) voluntary \u2013 involving some\nmeaningful degree of voluntary participation. There is some blurring at\nthe edges, but at their core there is a sector that is distinct in legal, finan-\ncial and organisational terms.\nA third concept, which is discussed fully later, but which is central to\nour argument is that of \u2018stakeholder ambiguity\u2019. By ambiguity we mean\nthat the traditional division of stakeholders, such as owners, paid staff\nand consumers or users is replaced in voluntary agencies by a bewilder-\ning complexity of overlapping roles.\nW H Y D O E S A V O L U N TA RY S E C T O R E X I S T AT A L L ?\nThis is not a new question, but it is our claim that it has yet to be satisfac-\ntorily answered. The standard British social policy texts on the topic are\ndescriptive rather than theoretical. The Wolfenden Report (1978) set out\nfive functions drawn from existing practice: the development of new\nkinds of service to meet new needs, services to other organisations, \nliaison between organisations, representation of minority interests and\ndirect service. Yet the state does all these already. So does the private\nmarket in many instances. Why should the voluntary sector do them any\nbetter? Political scientists are attracted to study the sector because it gives\npluralism to an otherwise monolithic state. But there are other ways to\nachieve pluralism \u2013 local state and community or market. In any case,\nwishing to see institutions exist is not the same as asking why do they\nexist?\nBritish writing about the voluntary sector has a long and distin-\nguished history and a full review is well beyond the possibilities of this\npaper. Nevertheless, a brief examination of several of the key texts of the\npast twenty years provides a necessary introduction to our discussion.\nA good starting point is the series of papers and books by Hadley and\nHatch (for example, Hadley et al., 1975; Hatch, 1980). Both writers were\ncontributors to the 1977 Wolfenden Report and their book Social Welfare\nand the Failure of the State (1981) represents probably the first serious,\nalbeit brief, attempt to analyse the different organisational characteris-\ntics of the various sectors. A more detailed researched-based work is\nHatch\u2019s study of three English towns (Hatch 1980). Here, the questions\nare asked: what are voluntary organisations and how can they be \nclassified? Again, the relevance for this paper is the tentative steps taken\nHuman Services and the Voluntary Sector 81\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\nto link different types of voluntary organisations \u2013 defined as mutual aid,\nvolunteer organisations, special agencies and funded charities \u2013 with\norganisational characteristics and the nature of the beneficiaries.\nA new phase of rather more theoretical British voluntary sector writing\ncoincides with the rise of an established body of international scholars,\nand the establishment of several new academic journals. The key writings\ncan be traced in a number of collected works (Batsleer et al., 1992; Billis\nand Harris, 1996; Smith et al., 1995). In this new phase several authors\nhave grappled with issues close to our starting question. For example,\nPaton (1992), who builds a model of the provision of goods and services\nbased on two dimensions: (a) organisational purposes and (b) degree of\ninstitutionalisation. \u2018Purposes\u2019 range from private profit through to those\norganisations that exist for the benefit of others. Institutionalisation\nranges from small informal organisations to large bureaucracies.\nThe British literature needs to be complemented by a substantial body\nof American writings in this area. These works \u2013 perhaps because of the\nvery different cultural, institutional, economic and policy context \u2013 have\noften addressed more directly the issue: why does the sector exist? Key\ncontributions are to be found in the work of Weisbrod, Hansmann,\nSalamon and Kramer (see DiMaggio and Anheier, 1990 for a review of\nthe sociological and other literature).\nWeisbrod (1986) is a good starting point: he begins with a model in\nwhich people in society \u2018behave rationally in pursuit of their individual\nobjectives of utility maximization\u2019 (1986, p. 22). This drives their voting\nbehaviour. Some want more collective goods and some less. Only \nthe median voter is fully satisfied. Some will be sufficiently dissatisfied \nto join organisations that provide more. \u2018Voluntary organisations come\ninto existence as extra governmental providers of collective-consumption\ngoods\u2019 (p. 30, italics in original). Thus non-profits come into being to \nprovide the extra high quality collective goods that the for-profit sector\ncannot.\nThe difficulty with this explanation is that voluntary organisations, do\nnot primarily seem to be providers of collective goods. Moreover, human\nservices with which we are concerned are essentially private goods,\nthough with some public good elements to them. A more general inter-\npretation of the Weisbrod thesis is that not only do markets fail but so do\ngovernments (Le Grand, 1991; Wolf 1979; and in a different tradition\nHadley and Hatch, 1981). Voluntary organisations therefore come into\nexistence to meet human service needs that are not met by the ordinary\nmarket, but at which governmental services are inefficient. Government\nfailure is the result of centralised monopoly provision, self-interested\n82 David Billis and Howard Glennerster\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\nproviders and professionals, much discussed in the public choice literature.\nOnce again, however, it is not clear why the voluntary sector provides the\nonly or main answer. Decentralised state services and quasi-markets\nbetween public providers are recent alternatives. The voluntary sector\nmay provide additional and more varied competition and hence improve\nthe market choice, but just why this should be the case is not obvious or,\nat least, not explicitly discussed.\nThe original collective goods deficiency theory of Weisbrod was criticised\nby Hansmann (1980, 1987). He also observed that most non-profits were\nnot providing collective or public goods. Building on earlier work by Nelson\nand Krashinsky (1973) he approached the question not from the point of\ngovernment failure, but from market failure. Contracts of certain kinds (for\nexample, aid to the starving in Africa) are very difficult to police. Donors\nare more likely to trust non-profits with gifts. This is what he calls the \u2018non-\ndistribution constraint\u2019: those who control the organisation have less\nincentive to take advantage of their customers. Voluntary organisations\ntherefore have a comparative survival advantage, providing the value of\nsuch protection outweighs their evident \u2018inefficiencies\u2019 (1987, p. 29). This\nmay explain why voluntary groups serve very vulnerable people. But why\nshould they be any better at it than the state sector? Moreover, are volun-\ntary agencies so free from the distribution constraint \u2013 the capacity to \ndistribute donors\u2019 money to paid staff, even if there are no shareholders? A\nfor-profit agency might compete successfully on low administration and\nhigh trust qualities. The differences between for-profit and voluntary\nagencies are not captured in the Hansmann thesis.\nIn contrast, Salamon (1987) presents a theory of \u2018voluntary failure\u2019:\nprevious theories, he claims, have failed to differentiate between govern-\nment\u2019s role as a provider of funds and deliverer of services, and have\nfailed to acknowledge the reality of third party government. According to\nthis view it is the government and market which should be regarded as\nthe residual mechanism in the provision of collective goods: collective\naction on community problems is best done on a voluntary basis by the\nvoluntary sector. Unfortunately, the voluntary sector, for all its strengths,\ncannot generate enough resources: it is vulnerable to particularism and\nfavouritism of the wealthy, paternalism and amateurism \u2013 hence volun-\ntary failure. However, it is not clear from this why any voluntary organi-\nsations should survive long term.\nIn short, we have a sequence of economic theories that point to the\nweakness of whole systems: market failure, government failure and vol-\nuntary failure. Voluntary organisations thus end up doing things that\nthey are relatively least bad at \u2013 a theory of comparative disadvantage.\nHuman Services and the Voluntary Sector 83\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\nThese theories tend to be system-wide, focused on the supply side and to\nconcentrate on a system\u2019s negative characteristics.\nA more positive approach is to be found in the substantial corpus of\nwork by Kramer which stretches back to the early 1960s. His seminal\nVoluntary Agencies in the Welfare State (1981) focused on the individual\nagency and \u2013 amongst other things \u2013 explored the basic characteristics,\nunique functions and vulnerabilities of voluntary agencies. He draws\nattention to \u2018prominent features\u2019 of agencies. For example, they are inter-\nest groups and they have considerable discretion in their use of resources.\nTheir unique functions are: (a) specialisation in a problem, a group of\npeople or a method of intervention; (b) advocacy; (c) consumerism and\nother forms of volunteerism; and (d) service provision, which is seen as\nthe most pervasive and least distinctive function.\nTraditional social policy discussion in Great Britain has tended to take\na line much nearer to the Kramer view, but it has emphasised the pio-\nneering role of the sector. The sector is a path finder and experimenter\nwith new services or newly recognised groups in need (Wolfenden,\n1978). The underlying assumption is that the state will step in when the\nexperiment is seen to work and the service becomes part of the main-\nstream welfare state. This is a line of argument largely absent in the\nUnited States and not at all part of the rationale advocated by the New\nRight in the 1980s. Once again it leaves relatively untheorised the rea-\nsons for the sector\u2019s supposed advantages in being innovative, as well as\nat what point it becomes beneficial to move to state provision.\nIt is true that these early American theories have moved on to some\ndegree (e.g., James, 1989; Kramer et al., 1993; Mason, 1984; Salamon in\nClotfelter 1992; Young, 1983). One of the core works (Hansmann,\n1980) has not been \u2018revisited\u2019 by Steinberg and Grey (1992). Nevertheless,\nthe reasoning remains largely concerned with the supply-side character-\nistics of voluntary agencies. Any full theoretical discussion ought surely\nto be as concerned with the users as the providers, the demand as much\nas the supply side.\nT O WA R D S A T H E O RY O F C O M PA R AT I V E A D VA N TA G E\nWhile grateful for the above corpus of work, we remain unconvinced that\nit provides an answer to the question with which we began. Our first\ncomplaint is that it does not differentiate clearly enough between the sec-\ntors and the incentive structures that differentiate them. Our second\ncomplaint is that it does not incorporate the users of human services and\ntheir characteristics or the interaction between users and organisations.\nWe begin with a brief look at the core organisational characteristics of\n84 David Billis and Howard Glennerster\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\nthe different sectors. This is then followed by a section with considers the\ntypes of demand put on the agencies by different categories of client. We\nconclude that some kinds of deprivation may be more effectively\nresponded to by agencies in one sector rather than another.\nSector characteristics: the supply side\nWe wish to posit several key organisational features which we believe are\ncharacteristic of each of the sectors. Table 1 attempts to display organisa-\ntional characteristics of the sectors. We divide these for simplicity into the\nstakeholders (who and what is the organisation driven by), the formal\norganisation structure, the core finance or resources and who the work-\ners are.\nIn Table 1 we have laid out just a few main factors which highlight the\nenduring differences in sector organisation, hence justifying its contin-\nued use as a powerful metaphor. Such factors cannot be ignored in any\nconsideration of differential response or comparative advantage. Even\nthis modest outline takes us immediately into deep water and we are\naware both of the debates that surround some of the components of the\nmodel, and other factors that might have been included. We are merely\ntrying to highlight some distinctive features of the sectors.\nPut crudely, public sector agencies are driven by what politicians believe\nwill secure them the necessary votes for re-election (for an account of the\nmedian voter approach see Dunleavy and O\u2019Leary, 1987). Despite the\ncriticism of this approach we nevertheless agree that: \u2018The median voter\ntheory is a factor which no elected government can afford to ignore for\nlong . . .\u2019 (Self, 1993, p. 106). We are reminded of the power of the\napproach in the UK, when, faced with what appeared to be a humiliating\ndefeat in the European election, the prime minister attempted to strike a\nchord with voters by making a strident attack on homeless people and\ncalling for the removal of \u2018beggars\u2019 from the streets. The structure of\nmost UK governmental human service agencies is that of the large\nHuman Services and the Voluntary Sector 85\nTA B L E 1\nSector Driven by Structure Core Finance Workers\nPublic Median voter Bureaucratic Taxes Paid: some volunteers\nand re-election\nPrivate Shareholder and Bureaucratic Sales Paid\nprofit related goals\nVoluntary Multiple stakeholders Ambiguous Taxes Paid and volunteers\nDonations \nCharges\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\nbureaucracy of paid staff organised into accountable managerial \nhierarchies with a clear division between those who control the agency\n(A), the paid staff or bureaucrats (B) and the users or clients (C); what\nBillis (1993b) elsewhere has called the ABC division. The core financial\nbasis (Glennerster, 1997) is derived in one way or another from taxation,\ndespite the growth of sales and even charitable contributions to, for\nexample, hospitals. The core staff are paid, notwithstanding the substan-\ntial number of volunteers used in hospitals (often overlooked in the\ndebate).\nUK private sector human service agencies have until recently been a\nminor feature of welfare provision, although the growth of private health\ncare provision and residential homes for the elderly have begun to\nchange the picture. Ignoring for the moment the \u2018principal\u2013agent prob-\nlem\u2019, that is to say \u2018how to get one person or organisation to act on behalf\nof another\u2019 (Milgrom and Roberts, 1992, p. 214), we assume private sec-\ntor agencies to be driven by shareholders and the need for profit. Other\ngoals are present but they must be consistent with sufficient rewards to\nshareholders to ward off potential take-overs. They too are bureaucrati-\ncally organised with the ABC division, as previously discussed. They are\nprimarily financed by sales of services and would not use volunteers,\nalthough volunteers may well be active in the private sector\u2019s community\nprogrammes. Again, we acknowledge the complications presented by the\nsmall family concern, but their relatively tiny role in overall UK service\nprovision provides some justification for bypassing this problem at this\njuncture.\nVoluntary human service organisations, as defined at the start of this\npaper, present a far more complex challenge for analysis, and represent\nanother of the founding puzzles of the field. This is evident from the start\nwhen we attempt to examine what drives their missions and policies. In\nthis analysis we have no choice but to short-cut the discussion and pre-\nsent our own case that such missions and policies are driven by multiple\nstakeholders. Whether it be \u2018enterpreneurs\u2019, any combination of Board\nand staff, funders of whatever sort, members, volunteers, users or even\nthe dead hand of past charismatic leaders, we suggest that multiple\nstakeholding is the general dominant characteristic. We also suggested\nthat stakeholder \u2018ambiguity\u2019 is a key distinguishing feature of voluntary\nagencies, e.g., they can share the characteristics of public and private\nbureaucracies as well as the features of the pure membership association.\nThe resource complexities have been well charted (Gronbjerg, 1993),\nand the use of volunteers is a critical feature.\nThe supply side that we postulate is thus more complex than that\n86 David Billis and Howard Glennerster\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\nwhich often appears to underpin the purely economic approaches which\ntake organisational structures as given. Voluntary agencies may be the\nmore effective suppliers in some situations, and for some clients, precisely\nbecause they are ambiguous and complex. Similarly, unambiguous\nbureaucratic structures accountable to median voters and shareholders\nmay not be the best suited to meet the needs of different types of clients. It\nis to a discussion of a number of these different client types that we now\nturn.\nThe demand side: states of client disadvantage\nOur main contention is that it is not possible to understand the compara-\ntive advantage or disadvantage of sectors or organisations without \nlooking at the characteristics of the clients and their interaction with the\nsupply characteristics of different agencies. Most services provided by the\nfor-profit sector and most services provided by the state are used by \nutility-maximising individuals and can be analysed in terms that are\nfamiliar to economists and political scientists. However, human service\norganisations are our main concern, and they are frequently dealing\nwith people disadvantaged in one form or other. We have therefore found\nit useful to relax the central assumption that underpins much of tradi-\ntional economic writing which posits individuals as all being rational\nself-interested utility maximisers. Likewise, political science theories, \nparticularly those of the newer public choice tradition, posit voters as\nself-interested utility maximisers.\nOur alternative approach is to group the various states of severe \nwelfare problems that might beset citizens and lead them to be incapable\nof benefiting from traditional supply mechanisms. In this section we \noffer initial definitions and a brief statement of some questions to be\naddressed.\nIn the first place individuals may have little or no money and find it diffi-\ncult to survive. They may be financially disadvantaged, lacking the purchas-\ning power to seek solutions in the market. In practice the position is often\nmore complex, since the individual may not be able or willing to use the\nmarket in a responsible way for themselves: they may, in other words, be\ndemonstrating an additional form of disadvantage (see below). They may\nalso be expected to act as agents on behalf of others, particularly children,\nand here we encounter another version of the principle\u2013agent problem.\nQuite separate from financial disadvantage might be those individuals\nwho are in what we might call a state of personal disadvantage. They are\npotential users who cannot articulate a coherent preference from the\norganisation in question. This group would include people with learning\nHuman Services and the Voluntary Sector 87\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\ndifficulties, or mental health problems, young children and confused\nelderly people. Even if they had the money, they would be unable to \nexercise their preferences on the organisation. They cannot be \u2018rational\nutility maximisers\u2019.\nThird, there may be individuals and groups who are, at any particular\ntime, societally disadvantaged. In other words they are \u2018blamed\u2019 or stigma-\ntised. They may be perfectly capable of exercising their \u2018exit\u2019 and \u2018voice\u2019\nfunctions (they are not personally disadvantaged), but society chooses\nnot to listen or makes it difficult for them to achieve economic power.\nTheir entry into the job market may be limited and politicians may lose\nvotes if they support their cause. In the UK this has been the case with\ngay people, ethnic minorities and single mothers in recent years.\nFinally, there are those who suffer primarily from the fact that they live\nin a particular community \u2013  they are community disadvantaged. They live\nin areas where the market, political and civil structures have broken\ndown. \u2018Respectable\u2019 firms will not wish to risk opening shops in such\nareas or providing work. The usual political parties have more or less\nceased to operate: voters in other parts of the town have no interest in\nallocating taxes to those living in those areas. This is a situation ripe for\nthe entry of the anti-state illegal organisations, the mafias and the local\ncriminal fraternities.\nWe have so far questioned the extent to which the concept of the \n\u2018rational utility maximising individual\u2019 provides a sophisticated enough\nexplanation for understanding the role of the voluntary sector. We have\nintroduced a \u2018cross industry\u2019 approach, and an initial categorisation of\nstates of disadvantage in order better to understand the puzzle. We have\nalso noted that we believe that the different structures of the agencies in\nthe different sectors have implications for their predisposition and ability to\nrespond to different categories of disadvantage. We turn now to examine\nthis in slightly more detail.\nWhere may the comparative advantages be?\nIf this approach is to be fruitful we need to examine the manner in which\nthe structural features of \u2018typical\u2019 agencies in each sector might cause\nthem to align with particular categories of disadvantage \u2013 or the way in\nwhich disadvantage attracts specific organisational response. However, it\nwill shortly become evident that combinations of disadvantage are likely\nto provide a more satisfying explanation than simple correlations\nbetween one disadvantage and a specific sector response.\nIn the case of financial disadvantage by itself, the state in most instances\ncan, if the need is deemed justified, provide the cash and thus remove the\n88 David Billis and Howard Glennerster\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\ndisadvantage. If the money is going for a purpose for which there is a\ngeneral consensus in society, the state provides the money, the politicians\nknow what they want, and the clear (ABC) accountability structure of\ntheir agencies can enable services to be offered in accordance with politi-\ncal and median voter wishes. In summary, unless combined with another\ndisadvantaged condition which, as we have noted, may well be the case,\nit is difficult to see what comparative advantage today\u2019s UK voluntary\nagencies have in this area. By itself, \u2018poverty\u2019 is probably too blunt a \nconcept to have much explanatory power. Giving financial help is suited\nto a public agency with clear rules and clear lines of accountability to\npolitical representatives of the taxpayer. This is a role which the British\nsocial security system carries out well. However, where it has to deal with\nvulnerable, stigmatised individuals, it is much less successful. This cate-\ngory is discussed below.\nThose who are personally disadvantaged require others (parents,\nguardians) to act on their behalf. Contract failure offers an explanation\nfor situations in which rational consumers cannot evaluate the service\naccurately. But what if the consumer requires \u2018others\u2019 that do not exist,\ndo not care or whose interests conflict with those who are disadvan-\ntaged? In these instances also, the private sector is unlikely to be seen to\nhave any comparative advantage. The state service delivery agency is an\nobvious possible alternative solution but median voter pressure is likely\nto be weak, and the organisation is likely to receive weak messages from\npoliticians in defining their goals and standards. Normal practice will be\ntherefore to leave it to the \u2018professionals\u2019 to act as the interpreter and\nguardian of the personally disadvantaged person. (We shall use the term\nprofessional to refer to a member of staff, who in a governmental agency\nwould usually be paid, and who employs a recognised body of knowl-\nedge.)\nThe long history of abuse and scandal in UK public institutions sug-\ngests that reliance on professional training and codes is not necessarily\nenough. Professionals are accountable to politicians who are not neces-\nsarily the best equipped to fulfil the role of \u2018guardians\u2019 of personally \ndisadvantaged people since such politicians may lack the required \nmotivation, sensitivity and knowledge. Here we contend that the multiple\nstakeholder and ambiguous structure of the voluntary agency can offer\ncomparative advantages.\nOur concept of stakeholder ambiguity draws on the research undertaken\nby one of the authors since 1978 with voluntary agencies in the UK.\nDuring this period more than 20 in depth case studies have been under-\ntaken, and some 300 agencies have participated in research workshops\nHuman Services and the Voluntary Sector 89\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\nand courses in which the material has been tested and refined. This UK\nmaterial is reinforced by a further study of 14 non-profits in the United\nStates. (Much of the history and details of this research and the full expo-\nsition of the concept can be traced in Billis, 1993a, 1996.) The concept of\nstakeholder ambiguity, which utilities the ideas of Leach (1976), was origi-\nnally developed in response to the distinctive organisational problems\npresented by participants in the early research programme. Those prob-\nlems were not fully addressed by traditional theories which were primar-\nily concerned with the large bureaucracies of the private and public \nsectors. The idea of stakeholder ambiguity also provides, we believe, a\npersuasive response to the long-standing scholarly puzzle, found in the\nvarious academic disciplines which have studied the voluntary sector, of\nsector overlap, \u2018fuzziness\u2019 or \u2018blurring\u2019 (Billis, 1993c). (Perhaps the most\nconcentrated body of writing on this subject is to be found in the 1987\nspecial edition of the former Journal of Voluntary Action Research (vol. 16,\nno. 1 and 2).\nIn essence, the notion of ambiguity begins by positing that there are\nfour \u2018worlds\u2019 within which social problems can be resolved: governmental\nand private sector bureaucracies, associations and the personal world.\nEach of these worlds has its own unambiguous and well-known rules of the\ngame. Thus bureaucracies (organisations which employ paid staff) rely on\nthe managerial command system, associations on concepts of member-\nship and voting; the personal world rests on unbounded ideas of commit-\nment, love and affection. In so far as the word \u2018owners\u2019 can be applied to\nall these worlds, each has its own distinctive structure of ownership. Since\nthis paper is concerned with organised policy responses to widespread and\noften severe problems we have in Table 1 only considered the \u2018unambigu-\nous\u2019 private and public sector worlds. For simplicity therefore we have not\nbrought the associational and personal worlds into the picture.\nWe contend that there are many organisations that are ambiguous:\nthat although their roots and ownership rest firmly in one sector, they\nnevertheless possess some of the structural features of other sectors. Of\nthese, the most interesting in our context are those organisations which\nhave associational roots and are neither owned by the government nor\nby the private sector, but yet have adopted the key characteristic of\nbureaucracies and have employed paid staff. These organisations are\nwhat we might call voluntary agencies as distinct from voluntary mem-\nbership associations. Again, for ease of exposition, we have simply\nreferred to these in Table 1 as the \u2018voluntary sector\u2019. Hence it is impor-\ntant to bear in mind that despite the fact that \u2018agencies\u2019 may represent\nthe fastest growing part of the sector and are the focus of current UK \n90 David Billis and Howard Glennerster\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\npolicy attention, there is nevertheless a vast and mainly unexplored terri-\ntory of genuine membership associations.\nThe key characteristic of the ambiguous voluntary agency is the \ncomplexity of overlapping roles. This has been particularly identified in\nthe governance structure where there is often overlap in the roles of \ngoverning bodies and paid staff. A striking example of this is provided by\nthe Pre-school Playgroup Association (Brophy, 1994, p. 162):\nFrom their inception playgroups were organised by mothers, some groups employed a\npaid leader but most were dependent on (unpaid) mothers working alongside the paid\nleader. Thus, the providers of the service, the users of the service and its managers were\nall mothers and frequently the same mothers doing all tasks.\nOur research has demonstrated that whereas in private and public sector\nbureaucracies where, in the main, there is clear-cut differentiation\nbetween employer and employee, employee and non-employee, provider\nand recipient, chairperson and director, director and subordinate, Board\nor management committee and staff, owners and others, in voluntary\nagencies all these categories can overlap in every possible combination.\nAnd for the voluntary agency, these are not idiosyncratic and temporary\naberrations, but a fundamental, structural characteristic resulting from\ntheir occupation of both the associational and bureaucratic worlds. It is\nnot surprising therefore that stakeholder ambiguity is often accompanied\nby deeper tensions between the demands of the bureaucratic paid staff\ncommand structure and requirements of the democratic membership\nassociation based on voluntary effort. (In passing we must note the pro-\nliferation of organisational forms which, whilst they have their roots and\nownership in the governmental sector, have adopted characteristics more\nusually associated with the voluntary sector, for example hospital\n\u2018trusts\u2019.)\nMoving on to consider the implications of stakeholder ambiguity for\nour analysis, we suggest that one consequence, for example, is that the\ngap between users and those in authority can be less given the potential\nfor greater motivation, sensitivity to, and knowledge about client need.\nHowever, ambiguity can also lead to poor communication, with a gov-\nerning body that is secure in its own ignorance.\nStakeholder ambiguity can mean that members of the governing body\nare expected to raise or donate funds for the operational purposes of \nthe agency, or they can perhaps be there because they have personal\nknowledge of a particular disadvantaged state. Volunteer service deliv-\nerers may well be a widespread source of labour, and they too may be on\nthe governing body. They may also be present or past sufferers from a\nHuman Services and the Voluntary Sector 91\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\nparticular disadvantage and therefore may be more sensitive to disadvan-\ntaged people. The critical point is that the political market failure and the \nformal hierarchy failure we identified earlier in public bureaucracies can\nbe overcome within the informality of an ambiguous and relatively small\nvoluntary organisation.\nThere is a price to be paid. Professionals (both paid and volunteer) in\nvoluntary agencies can find themselves in disagreement with other\nstakeholders. Relationships between professionals and governing bodies\nare notoriously difficult in parent-run agencies. We must also bear in\nmind that, except for children, a state of personal disadvantage may well\nbe lifelong. The resource demands, say, for residential care are likely to be\nhuge. In this case the voluntary agency, unless it has very substantial\nindependent funding, is likely to have a narrow definition of eligible\ngroups or has to become heavily engaged in pressure group activity to\npersuade voters and governments to change any negative attitudes. But,\nall in all, there is a prima facie case to argue that voluntary agencies may\nhave a real competitive advantage in restricted but important areas of\nhuman service provision, where their structures produce incentives for\nmore sensitive service.\nStigmatised individuals and groups, those we have referred to as \nsocietally disadvantaged \u2013 again by definition \u2013 are unattractive customers\nfor public sector agencies. If they have the money such customers can\nutilise certain very expensive private clinics for alcoholics, drug users,\netc. but one exception to the general failure of governmental agencies to\nenter this particular field is that of the UK National Health Service (NHS),\nwhich is still large enough, and carried sufficient public esteem, to deal\nwith drug addicts and Aids victims, as part of its general work. This part\nof its remit rarely comes to public attention and little is known with\nrespect to user needs and preferences. The advantages of stakeholder\nambiguity, argued in the case of personal disadvantage, hold here also,\nbut they are not absolute. The for-profit agency can comfortably deal\nwith those who have the money and are capable of expressing their pref-\nerences. Voluntary agencies will have an advantage particularly when\nsocietal is combined with financial disadvantage.\nThose facing community disadvantage suffer from an absence of the \nnormal institutions of civil society. Shops, together with other signs of a\nmarket economy, have disappeared along with public services. The state\nhas the resources and may intervene when a riot looms, offering a flower\nfestival or some other colourful short-term intervention to satisfy the\naverage voter that something is being done. But intervention, in the\nmain, has been short term and incoherent. These deprived areas are now\n92 David Billis and Howard Glennerster\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\none of Europe\u2019s major chronic problems, to which neither the state nor\nthe market have been able to respond. Self-help and community mobili-\nsation, despite the resource constraints, appear to be one of the few\ningredients of a possible upwards cycle (Power, 1993). The churches may\nhave a particular role, both in helping to recreate a true civil society, but\nalso through its encouragement of human service agencies in these\nareas. The argument so far may be summarised in Table 2.\nIt is not the purpose of this article to test our theory exhaustively. That\nmust wait longer-term research, although a review of available evidence\non the effects of Community Care plans and voluntary organisations\n(after also noting the absence of empirical data and conceptual clarity),\nagrees with the general thrust of this paper in questioning the appropri-\nateness of traditional economic theory (Mocroft and Thomason, 1993).\nNevertheless, some preliminary evaluation is possible. If we take the first\ncolumn and ask how far the various sectors respond to the financial\nneeds of the poor, it is fairly clear that the state does provide the bulk of\nthis activity. There are private money lenders who make very expensive\nloans to the poor, but such provision is insignificant compared to the vast\nscale of state activity. Interestingly, the voluntary sector did, in the nine-\nteenth and earlier centuries, make an important contribution to reliev-\ning poverty with cash aid. The work of the Charity Organisation Society\nand other cash giving agencies not only declined as state cash-giving\ngrew, but also increasingly took on the task of relieving personal disad-\nvantage. Cash giving is now an insignificant part of the tasks of the \nvoluntary sector. While there is no systematic UK research in this area,\nthe withdrawal of American non-profits from the relief of poverty is\nanalysed by Salamon (1993).\nWhen we turn to the column headed \u2018personal disadvantage\u2019, we pre-\ndict a large voluntary sector component and we do find these organisa-\ntions exceptionally well represented. A higher share of their total activity\nmay fall under this heading than any other. Again, although systematic\nHuman Services and the Voluntary Sector 93\nTA B L E 2.

The state is clearly impor-\ntant in this field too, but its scope is more widespread. Organisations that\ndeal exclusively with the stigmatised are to be found almost exclusively in\nthe voluntary sector. Here are to be found hundreds of often smaller organ-\nisations, such as local groups of MIND, Community Drug Helpline, Turning\nPoint, Phoenix House, Bow Mission, etc. The specialist treatment of groups\nlike AIDS patients by the state typically has a public health rationale as a\nsignificant element, rather than care and compassion as such. Finally, our\nown experience of working in the most deprived communities suggests that\nchurches and self-help and voluntary groups are often the last resort,\nwhen even the main stream public services have given up.\nClearly these impressions need to be thoroughly assessed. There are\ncounter examples. But it seems to us there is enough of a case here to be\nworth fuller examination and testing. It does seem that we find a higher\nproportion of human service activities dealing with personal, societal and\ncommunity disadvantage. This framework does provide a rational for \nconsiderable voluntary non-profit activity. The extent will vary through\ntime. One society may hold certain disabilities to be stigmatic, another\nmay not. The definition of disadvantage is after all social. So must be the\ncomparative advantages and disadvantages of the voluntary sector.\nC O N C L U S I O N S A N D Q UA N DA R I E S\nOur intention has been to open up a line of enquiry which brings together\nthe supply side characteristics of welfare agencies in the different sectors\nwith the demand side characteristics of a number of different categories\nof disadvantage. The general thrust of our argument has been that it is\nthe very complexity or ambiguity of voluntary organisations which can\nprovide them with comparative advantages.\nMoving rapidly through the disadvantaged states, we suggest that\nwhere the problems are well understood and supported by the general\npublic, and political messages to professionals are clear (as with problems\nof general financial disadvantage), the governmental bureaucratic service\nagency should have a comparative advantage. We are not convinced that\nin the UK in these types of situations, public sector \u2018welfare bureaucrats\u2019\nare primarily motivated by their own interests and unwarranted organi-\nsational growth (Tullock, 1965; Niskanen, 1971). Our own experience\n(for a critique of public choice theories see Self, 1993: 34) leads us to\nbelieve that this can be a phenomenon present in any sector.\n94 David Billis and Howard Glennerster\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\nAs we have tried to indicate earlier, voluntary agencies may well have\na comparative advantage in responding to those people who are in what\nwe have called a state of personal disadvantage. However if they have the\nmoney, \u2018guardians\u2019 may choose private sector agencies (clinics and\nhomes, etc.). The particular conditions whereby guardians with indepen-\ndent resources choose voluntary rather than for-profit agencies for those\nfor whom they have responsibilities are as yet unexplored. Voluntary\norganisations of course often suffer from a less reliable resource base, \nand this must be juxtaposed with their advantages of sensitivity and\nmotivation.\nA similar argument can be employed when examining societal disad-\nvantage and the comparative advantages of the different sectors, particu-\nlarly government and voluntary, the two main competitors in this area of\nneed. The stronger the political consensus and the greater the resources\ndemanded, so too will the governmental agency have greater advan-\ntages. Voluntary agencies have advantages where motivation and sensi-\ntivity are in scarce supply. As long as the NHS has wide based public sup-\nport, with a committed staff and an ample supply of potential nurses and\ndoctors, with many thousands of people prepared to volunteer for work\nin hospitals (a phenomenon sometimes overlooked in sector analysis),\nand many members of the general public prepared to donate money in\naddition to paying their taxes, then it is difficult to see much scope for a\nrenewal of voluntary sector activity. Following this line of argument\ntakes us to questioning whether the recent opted-out hospital trusts \ncan really be treated as part of the voluntary sector. More likely, in our\nview, is that this is an attempt to steal some of the voluntary sector\u2019s\norganisational clothes, whilst remaining in all key respects public sector\ninstitutions.\nWe have included in our analysis the state of community disadvantage. It\nappears to us to be the most intractable problem for UK public policy. We\nbelieve that voluntary agencies do have an advantage in this area.\nIndeed, talk of \u2018comparative advantage\u2019 may be too optimistic where\nthere may be little other organisational alternative. Certainly the track\nrecord of government is so far pretty dismal.\nOur general argument is that voluntary agencies have a  comparative\nadvantage over other sector agencies in areas where their distinctive\nambiguous and hybrid structures enable them to overcome problems of\nprincipal\u2013agent gap, median voter reluctance, weak messages from\npoliticians to staff and lack of market interest. We must emphasise again\nthat we have considered only severe welfare problems. We have not dis-\ncussed the pervasive, less severe states of discomfort. We have a strong\nHuman Services and the Voluntary Sector 95\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\nbelief that in this area of need the voluntary organisation reigns\nsupreme, and that this area certainly warrants further research.\nWe are not sanguine regarding notions of comparative advantage. It is\nperhaps best to see advantages as intrinsic characteristics which in the\nreal world may, or, as we have hinted several times, may not be fulfiled.\nMoreover, theories that attempt to explain why any sector exists run the\nrisk of defending the status quo, of building the theory on the basis of\ncurrent situations. Whilst theories of the sector must naturally relate to\nthe world as it is, or more often a specific country, they should also help\nresolve or shed light on current dilemmas or even perhaps at future\nminefields. The final part of this paper raises several issues of concern.\nQuandaries\nOur line of reasoning leads to one central quandary facing UK voluntary\nagencies, the question of their expanded role in welfare provision (Lewis,\n1993; Billis and Harris, 1992). Again it is not a new problem, but we\nsuggest that by taking ideas of comparative advantage into account, a\ncoherent case can be developed. Put simply, we argue that the less the\nstakeholder ambiguity, the lower the comparative advantage. For exam-\nple, if increased size leads to increased differentiation and separation of\nstakeholder roles, we contend that comparative advantage begins to\ndiminish. If paid staff, governing body and users are all quite separate, all\nthe problems faced by agencies in other sectors begin to appear. If service\nvolunteers begin to depart the agency and\/or begin to move out of any\ngovernance roles as well, then ambiguity diminishes. So whilst sympa-\nthetic to the general tenor of papers that are also worried about volun-\ntary sector scandals and erosion of legitimacy, it is far from certain that\nthe solution lies in the design of \u2018practical criteria for the identification \nof stakeholders\u2019 (Ben-Ner and Hoomissen, 1994: 412). Stakeholder\nambiguity cannot be eliminated without destroying comparative advan-\ntage. On the other hand, we would not wish to give the impression that\nambiguity necessarily implies a confused organisation \u2013 rather it implies\na flexible, changing and informal structure.\nThe other main advantage of the voluntary organisation is its lack of\nreliance on the voter market place, driven by the concerns and prejudices\nof the median voter. The more voluntary organisations become the vehi-\ncle for state money, the less this will be true.\nTo sum up. We have put forward initial thoughts regarding a theory of\ncomparative advantage which takes into account both the organisational\nfeatures of human service agencies and the different states of user disad-\nvantage. Following this approach leads us to question the long-term \n96 David Billis and Howard Glennerster\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Oct 2012 IP address: 158.143.192.135\nviability of voluntary agencies that attempt to respond to large-scale\nneeds outside the core areas of personal, societal and community \ndisadvantage. Their very real advantages are likely to be particularly\nseen where personal and societal needs and combined, and where they\nare not overwhelmed by resource constraints. Seen in this light, organi-\nsational growth, for example as a result of contracting with public agen-\ncies, is certainly a phenomenon to be carefully monitored by those who\nare interested in the public policy role of voluntary agencies, and also by\nthose who are concerned to ensure a healthy voluntary sector. Over\neager \u2018privatisers\u2019 may be destroying the very comparative advantages\nthe sector has to offer.\nR E F E R E N C E S\nJ. Batsleer, C. Cornforth and R. Paton (eds.)
