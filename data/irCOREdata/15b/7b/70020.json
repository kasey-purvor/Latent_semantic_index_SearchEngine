INTRODUCTION\nHigh-power ElectroMagnetic (EM) technologies such\nas klystrons and particle accelerators utilise the interac-\ntion between charged particles and conductive structures\nto either store energy in EM fields or to extract energy\nfrom EM fields.\nConventional technologies used in particle accelerators\nsuffer from a number of issues. These include parasitic\neffects such as wakefields1, created by the radiation from\nparticles passing through accelerator structures that can\nexcite high order modes (HOMs) causing instabilities.\nThere is also the need to improve intensity, stability, de-\nlivery and energy of the beam, driven by the need to\nreduce the size of accelerators due to practical and eco-\nnomic constraints.\nCurrent accelerators generally operate at frequencies\nbelow 3GHz. At higher frequencies (10\u2019s of GHz) acceler-\nators can operate with reduced stored energy and power\nconsumption2. This has the advantage of higher aver-\nage power capability and higher efficiency of operation2,3.\nHowever, operating conventional technology at higher\nfrequencies exacerbates the problems caused by wake-\nfields, which scale with the cube of the frequency4, and\nhamper the use of conventional structures at higher fre-\nquencies.\nExtensive research on novel acceleration techniques to\naddress these issues5\u20138 is underway. One possible solu-\ntion, which is gaining increased interest, is the use of Pho-\ntonic Band Gap (PBG) structures9\u201311. These structures\nhave attracted considerable interest for their ability to\nconfine, manipulate, guide and inhibit light12\u201316. For ex-\nample: Smirnova et al.11 have successfully demonstrated\nthe acceleration of an electron beam at 17 GHz using a\nPBG structure; Sirigiri in17 demonstrated a gyrotron os-\ncillator using a PBG structure; Smirnov and Yu have a\ndesign using PBG structures for a multibeam Klystron18;\nand we are considering applications of Crab-PBG struc-\ntures.\nConventional high-power microwave technologies gen-\nerally use either standing-wave or traveling-wave struc-\ntures. Standing-wave structures (resonant cavities) es-\ntablish standing electromagnetic waves with the electric\nfield along the direction of propagation. The frequency\nof a resonant cavity is very dependent upon geometry,\nin particular the radius, where the dimensions scale in-\nversely with frequency19.\nIn PBG structures, resonant cavities can be formed\nby creating a defect in the periodic lattice. This allows\nan EM mode to exist inside the band gap which cannot\npropagate through the lattice, localizing the mode at the\ndefect site. This frequency dependence makes it possible\nto create a structure where a specific mode is confined,\nbut the HOMs which wakefields excite are not present\nat the defect site. These HOMs propagate away from\nthe defect site through the PBG lattice. This ability\nof PBG structures to inhibit light offers a unique way to\nsuppress wakefields, enabling operation of accelerators at\nfrequencies of 10\u2019s of GHz.\nAny physically realizable structure will inherently have\nsome degree of disorder, therefore it is important to un-\nderstand the effect this disorder will have on the prop-\nerties of the structure. Previous papers have extensively\nstudied the effect that disorder in PBG structures has\non transmission and reflection properties20\u201322. The ma-\njority of this previous work has focused on disorder in\nbulk photonic crystals with very few looking at cavity\nresonators, and only one paper to date examining the\neffect of disorder on resonant frequency23. Zhu et al.23\nfocused on applying white noise to the whole photonic\ncrystal structure, looking at the resonant frequency and\nthe quality factor of the cavity, only considering the case\nof a purely dielectric structure.\nIn this paper we extend this work by investigating the\neffects of disorder on the resonant frequency and the EM\nfield distribution of a metallic photonic band gap cav-\nity resonator. We do this by moving specific scatterers\nof the photonic crystal. We have focused on metallic\nstructures as they are more commonly used than dielec-\ntric resonators in high power EM applications. Dielectric\nstructures have specific issues, such as surface charging,\nhigh-losses, breakdown and multipactor discharges that\n2inhibit performance.\nII. METHODOLOGY\nThe most commonly used type of PBG lattice in high\npower microwave applications is the 2-Dimensional (2D)\ntriangular lattice of metal rods with separation a and\nradius r. In this paper the central rod is removed to\ncreate a defect in the band gap, forming the site of the\ncavity resonator. Figure 1 shows the ideal PBG struc-\nture, considered in this paper. The base structure is\nthe ideal case consisting of rods with identical separation\na = 0.0124m and identical radius r = 0.00186m. The\nresonator formed by removing the central rod has a res-\nonant frequency (or \u2018base frequency\u2019 f0) of 9.4072GHz.\nAny changes in the rod separation or radius are made in\nrelation to this base structure. As a comparison, the base\nstructure was also modeled using MAFIA, with an agree-\nment with the COMSOL determined base frequency to\nthe 8th decimal place. Any higher order modes are re-\nstricted to the edges of the structure.\nFIG. 1: Ideal Base PBG Structure, consisting of Perfectly\nElectrically Conducting (PEC) rods surrounded by a PEC\nwall. Removal of the central rod localises a single EM mode\nat f0 = 9.0472GHz. All rods have a radius of 0.00186m and\na seperation of 0.0124m. The contours show the extent of the\nelectric field of the mode.\nDisorder was introduced to the structure by adding \u00b1\na random number between 0-15%, 0-10%, 0-5%, or 0-1%,\nof the initial parameters a and r, to each individual rod.\nDepending which parameter this disorder is applied to,\nit has the effect of altering the position, radius or \u2018both\u2019,\nmeaning a combination of both the position and radius,\nof each rod. The random number used was taken from a\nuniform distribution pseudo-random number generator.\nThis effectively introduces a white noise error to the di-\nmensions of the PBG structure.\nFocusing on the example of the position of the rods\nwith a 10% disorder applied to the whole structure, 30\ndifferent random configurations of the structure were gen-\nerated. Each disordered structure was processed to find\nthe resonant frequency and the peak electric field at the\ncentre of the structure. The results from these 30 dis-\nordered structures were then averaged to give a mean\nvalue of the resonant frequency and peak electric field\nfor a structure with 10% disorder to the position of the\nrods. This process was then repeated for different per-\ncentage disorders applied to the position, radius or both.\nThe analysis was then extended to more specific cases.\nThe resonant frequency of each PBG structure was cal-\nculated using the commercially available finite element\npackage COMSOL Multiphysics. This software was used\nto find the eigenmodes of each structure, using an auto-\nmatic mesh refining technique to ensure accuracy of the\nsolution.\nTo determine the peak electric field, simulations were\nperformed using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)\nmethod24, with a freely available software package with\nsubpixel smoothing for increased accuracy25. Each dis-\nordered structure was excited with a point source of fre-\nquency 9.4072GHz (the resonant frequency of the ideal\nstructure). For each disordered structure the source was\nallowed to run for the 20 RF cycles, it was then switched\noff and the simulation was then left to run for 20 RF\ncycles. The electric field was then recorded for next 20\nRF cycles. Analysis of the recorded peak electric field\nat each cycle shows a small variation due to the finite\nspatial and temporal resolution of the FDTD technique.\nBy increasing the resolution, this variation was reduced\nto between 1-2% between all 20 cycles. The value of the\npeak electric field taken for each disordered structure is\nthe mean value of the peak field during the last set of 20\nRF cycles.\nIII. RESONANT FREQUENCY\nTo explore how disorder effects the resonant frequency\nof the PBG structure the finite element package COM-\nSOL Multiphysics was used to determine the eigenmodes\nof various disordered PBG structures. Results are com-\npared to the resonant frequency of the base structure of\nfigure 1.\nInitially, we considered disorder applied to position,\nradius and both for all rods in the structure. Disorder of\n10%, 5%, and 1% of the initial parameters a and r was\ninvestigated. For each case, 30 disordered structures were\nconsidered and averaged as outlined above. The effects\nof a random disorder applied to the whole structure are\nshown in figure 2. The resonant frequency is plotted\nagainst the percentage disorder for position, radius and\nboth. The mean value of the resonant frequency for each\ndisorder (1%, 5%, 10%) is shown by the plotted marker.\nThe solid line indicates the resonant frequency of the\nideal base structure, f0, and the vertical bars show one\nstandard deviation from the mean.\nThe results show for disorders of 1% and 5%, the mean\nonly varies slightly from the base frequency. We note that\nfor a 10% disorder, the variation of the mean from the\nbase frequency is about 1%. In terms of percentage dis-\norder, separation has a larger effect than radius. While\nthe effect on the resonant frequency of applying disor-\n30 5 10\n9.25\n9.30\n9.35\n9.40\n9.45\n9.50\n9.55\n Both\n Radius\n Separation\n Base\nR\nes\non\nan\nt F\nre\nqu\nen\ncy\n, G\nH\nz\n% Disorder\nFIG. 2: The effect of disorder in radius, separation and both\napplied to the whole structure.

For each case of radius, separation and\nboth, the data is plotted laterally displaced for clarity. The\nmarkers show the mean resonant frequency averaged over 30\nstructures. The vertical error bars show one standard devi-\nation from the mean. The horizontal line indicates the base\nfrequency.\nder to both, can be seen as approximately equal to the\nsum of the separate variations in position and radius. In\nterms of absolute variation, where a 5% variation in ra-\ndius (\u223c 0.1mm) is approximately equal to a 1% variation\nin position (\u223c 0.1mm), we can see that the effect on the\nresonant frequency is approximately equal in both cases.\nAlthough the mean resonant frequency remains fairly\nconstant and close to that of the base structure, we note\nthat for some structures increasing disorder causes the\nresonant frequency to significantly deviate from the base\nvalue. To understand this behaviour we analysed the ef-\nfect on the resonant frequency of altering the position\nand radius of individual rods. Starting with the ring of\nthe innermost rods, closest to the centre of the struc-\nture (labeled ring 1), each rod is systematically moved\nby 10%, 5%, and 1% of its\u2019 initial separation a into and\nout from the centre. This process was then applied to\nthe rods in the second and third rings of rods from the\ncentre. It was finally extended to the rods of the outer\nrings but was found to have a negligible effect (less than\n0.001%).\nFigure 3 shows the results of this examination. We\ncan immediately see that the effect of moving the rods of\nring 1, dominates over the other rings. As the rods are\nmoved into the centre the resonant frequency increases,\nwhile moving the rods away from the centre results in a\ndecrease in the resonant frequency. This is the case for\nthe rods of all rings, although the further out the ring,\nthe lesser the effect it has upon the resonant frequency.\nThis behaviour can be understood in terms of perturba-\ntion to the cavity geometry as discussed in reference 19.\n0 5 10\n8.4\n8.8\n9.2\n9.6\n10.0\n10.4\n10.8\nR\nes\non\nan\nt F\nre\nqu\nen\ncy\n, G\nH\nz\n% Shift\n Ring 1 In\n Ring 1 Out\n Ring 2 In\n Ring 2 Out\n Ring 3 In\n Ring 3 Out\n Base\nFIG. 3: Considering the rods in the base structure as arranged\nin rings of rods around the defect region, the innermost ring\nlabeled ring 1. This graph shows the fundamental resonant\nfrequency achieved by moving all rods in a specific ring in and\nout by various percentages relative to the base structure. The\nhorizontal line indicates the base frequency.\nInward perturbations raise the resonant frequency and\noutward perturbations decrease the resonant frequency,\nso as the rods of ring 1 are moved in towards the centre of\nthe structure the volume of the defect region decreases,\nthis naturally results in a higher resonant frequency of\nthe structure. As the rods are moved out, away from\nthe centre, the larger volume results in the observed fre-\nquency decrease. As the size of the perturbation increases\nso does the relative shift in resonant frequency.\nWith this in mind, when considering disorder applied\naround the defect region, as disorder increases the spread\nin resonant frequencies of the structure increases, as seen\nin figure 2. This argument would imply that the mean\nfrequency should be equal to the resonant frequency of\nthe base structure. To develop this argument further a\nrandom disorder introduced into each individual ring was\ninvestigated and we can start to consider how disorder in\neach ring of rods contributes to the performance of the\nentire structure. This analysis was done by introducing\ndisorder separately to each ring in turn. 10%, 5%, and 1%\ndisorder is introduced to rod position, radius and both.\nIn each case all other rods are kept in the base configu-\nration. The results of this analysis are shown in figure\n4. Even with a 10% disorder the effects of this disorder\nin rings three, four and five were found to be negligible,\nso for clarity are not presented here. For disorders of\n1% and 5% the mean only varies slightly from the base\nstructure, whereas for a 10% disorder the variation of the\nmean from the base structure is quite marked. This is in\nagreement with the results shown in figure 2 but conflict\nwith the arguments surrounding figure 3. To investigate\nthis further we examined the frequency of each structure\nwith 10% disorder to both. We found that out of the\n430 samples, two had particularly low values. To investi-\ngate this, we increased the number of structures at 10%\ndisorder to both, from 30 to 40. The mean value for 40\nstructures is shown in figure 4 by the \u2018cross\u2019 marker. We\nsee that this mean is closer to the base frequency, which\nsuggests that the variation of the mean from the base\nfrequency is due to the limited number of samples.\nWe also examined the effect that disorder has on the\nposition and frequency of higher order modes of the struc-\nture. We found that even at 10% disorder the frequencies\nand positions of the higher order modes were unaffected.\n0 5 10\n9.20\n9.24\n9.28\n9.32\n9.36\n9.40\n9.44\n9.48\n9.52\n9.56\n0 5 10\n9.404\n9.405\n9.406\n9.407\n9.408\n9.409\n9.410\nR\nes\non\nan\nt F\nre\nqu\nen\ncy\n, G\nH\nz\n% Disorder\n Both R1\n Radius R1\n Separation R1\n Both R2\n Radius R2\n Separation R2\n Base\nR\nes\non\nan\nt F\nre\nqu\nen\ncy\n, G\nH\nz\n% Disorder\nFIG. 4: The effect that disorder of radius and separation\nin each ring of rods has on resonant frequency.

The extra cross marker at the 10%\nlevel of disorder is the mean frequency found by increasing\nthe number of structures from 30 to 40. The insert shows the\nresults of disorder in ring 2 to give a clearer picture of the\nbehaviour.\nIV. PEAK FIELD\nTo examine how disorder effects the peak electric field\nin PBG structures, the FDTD technique outlined in sec-\ntion II was used to excite electric fields at the centre of\nthe defect site of PBG structures with various, random\nor specific, rod displacements and radii variations. The\nresults were then compared to the base structure. The\npeak electric field for the base structure (the \u2018base field\u2019)\nis 26.749V. In all cases the EM source at the fundamental\nfrequency 9.4072GHz is used.\nAs in the case of the resonant frequency, firstly we\nconsidered disorder applied to the whole structure in the\ncases of position, radius and both. Disorder of 15%, 10%,\n5%, and 1% of the initial parameters a and r was in-\nvestigated. For each case 30 disordered structures were\nconsidered and averaged as outlined previously. The nu-\nmerical results of these simulations are shown in figure\n5. The peak Ez component of the electric field is plotted\nagainst the percentage disorder for position, radius, and\nboth. The solid horizontal line indicates the base field.\nThe mean value of Ez for each disorder (1%, 5%, 10%,\n15%) is shown by the plotted marker. The vertical bars\nshow one standard deviation from the mean.\n0 5 10 15\n16\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n Both\n Radius\n Separation\n Base\nEz\n, V\n\/m\n% Disorder\nFIG. 5: The effect of disorder in radius, separation and both\napplied to the whole structure. The peak field at the defect\nsite is shown against disorder magnitude for 1%, 5%, 10%\nand 15% disorder. For each case of radius, separation and\nboth, the data is plotted laterally displaced for clarity. The\nmarkers show the mean peak field averaged over 30 structures.\nThe vertical error bars show one standard deviation from the\nmean. The horizontal line indicates the base field.\nAs one would expect, increasing disorder of the struc-\nture causes the mean peak field to decrease. Again, as in\nthe case of the resonant frequency, in terms of percent-\nage disorder, separation has a larger effect than radius.\nWhile the effect on the peak field of applying disorder to\nboth, can be seen as approximately equal to the sum of\nthe separate variations in position and radius. In terms\nof absolute variation, we can see that the effect on the\npeak field is approximately equal in both cases.\nAlthough overall the trend of the mean peak field\nis to decrease with increasing disorder, there are some\nstructures that produce results showing the opposite be-\nhaviour. Looking at moving the individual rods of the\nrings into and out from the centre sheds some light on\nthis behaviour. Again, each rod in a ring of rods, is\nsystematically moved by 10%, 5%, and 1% of its ini-\ntial separation a into and out from the centre while all\nother rods remain in the base configuration. These re-\nsults are shown in figure 6. Moving the rods of ring 1\nhas the greatest effect on the peak field, as in the case\nof the resonant frequency results. The effects of moving\nring 1 can be understood in terms of frequency detun-\ning and mode concentration12.

This graph shows the peak field achieved by\nmoving all rods in a specific ring in and out by various per-\ncentages relative to the base structure. The horizontal line\nindicates the base field.\nby 5%, 10%, and 15%, either in or out, is so large that\nthe resonant frequency of the defect region is either in-\ncreased or decreased by a significant amount (cf. figure\n3). The resonant frequency of the structure now shifts\nto a frequency fs. This shift in the resonant frequency\nof the structure means that the frequency of the excita-\ntion source at f0 is so far from the resonant frequency,\nfs, of the structure, that the EM field poorly couples to\nthe cavity. This leads to a decrease in energy stored in\nthe excited field compared to the base structure. In the\ncase of a 1% movement of the rods in or out, the shift in\nthe resonant frequency of the cavity (as shown in figure\n3) is small enough that the excitation source still couples\nstrongly to the resonator. Using the FDTD technique,\nwe analysed the field energy in the defect region. In all\nthree cases (base, move rods-in, move rods-out) the total\nenergy in the volume of the defect region is constant.\nMoving the rods in and out changes the volume over\nwhich this energy is distributed. The energy stored in\nthe EM field is given by (E \u00b7 D + |H|)\/2, where E and\nH are the electric and magnetic field components and D\nthe electric displacement field. So in order to maintain a\nconstant energy, a reduction in the volume results in an\nincrease in EM field magnitude. Likewise, an increase in\nthe volume results in a decrease of the EM field magni-\ntude. This same interpretation can be applied to moving\nthe rods of ring 2, although to a much lesser extent.\nConsidering how disorder within each ring effects the\npeak field, 10%, 5%, and 1% disorder was introduced\nto rod position, radius and both, introducing disorder\nseparately to each ring in turn. Again, in each case all\nother rods are kept in the base configuration. The results\nof this FDTD analysis are shown in figure 7. The effects\nof disorder in rings three, four and five were found to be\nnegligible, so for clarity are not presented.\n0 5 10\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n0 5 10\n26.58\n26.64\n26.70\n26.76\n26.82\nEz\n, V\n\/m\n% Disorder\n Both R1\n Radius R1\n Separation R1\n Both R2\n Radius R2\n Separation R2\n Base\nEz\n, V\n\/m\n% Disorder\nFIG. 7: The effect that disorder of radius and separation\nin each ring of rods has on peak field. The markers show\nthe mean peak field taken over 30 structures, with error bars\nshowing one standard deviation from the mean. The horizon-\ntal line shows the peak field of the base structure. The insert\nshows the results of disorder in ring 2 to give a clearer picture\nof the behaviour.\nNote that the effect of disorder of the inner ring (ring\n1) dominates over the effects of the other rings of rods.\nIn terms of percentage disorder, separation has a larger\neffect than radius, and in terms of absolute variation,\nseparation and radius have about equal effect.\nAs seen in figure 5, the mean peak field decreases with\nincreasing disorder when disorder is introduced to the\nwhole structure. We see the same behaviour reproduced\nin figure 7 when the disorder is introduced into ring 1\nonly. The magnitude of displacement and direction is de-\ntermined using a pseudo-random number generator with\na uniform distribution. As percentage of total disorder\nincreases, a greater number of rods are subject to a larger\nchange in their position or radius. This leads to an in-\ncrease in the number of structures with a lower value\nin the peak file. Comparing figures 5 and 7 we see the\nbehaviour due to disorder in the entire structure is effec-\ntively defined solely by disorder in ring 1.\nAn understanding of how disorder in position and ra-\ndius interact can be found by examining the distribution\nof the peak field values for a large number of structures.\nFigure 8 shows the distribution of the peak field from\n300 different structures of 5% disorder to both. The in-\nset graphs show the distribution of peak field from 300\ndifferent structures of 5% disorder to position and radius\nseparately. The distributions for disorder in either radius\nor separation are slightly skewed, with the peak field of\nthe base structure higher than the mean peak field of the\ndisordered structure. This can be understood by con-\nsidering the arguments presented above concerning the\n65 10 15 20 25 30\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n24.0 24.5 25.0 25.5 26.0 26.5 27.0 27.5 28.0\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nC\nou\nnt\ns\nEz, V\/m\n20 22 24 26 28 30\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nC\nou\nnt\ns\nEz, V\/m\nC\nou\nnt\ns\nEz, V\/m\nFIG. 8: Distribution of peak field value for 300 structures.\nThe main curve shows the distribution for 5% disorder to\nboth radius and position. The inset curves show; Top, 5%\ndisorder to radius and bottom, 5% disorder to position. The\ndoted line shows the base structure peak field.\neffect on the peak field of moving the rods in and out.\nGenerally, more structures are created with rod position\nor radius configurations that result in a lower peak field\nthan the base. Hence, shifts of greater than 1% inwards\nwill result in detuning of the cavity and therefore a lower\nfield. By increasing the magnitude of disorder these ef-\nfects on average occur with increased probability, shifting\nthe mean peak field for the disordered structure to a lower\nvalue. The distribution for disorder in both, shown in fig-\nure 8, becomes highly skewed. We can see that, although\nfor the majority of structures the peak field is lower than\nthe base peak field, for approximately 30% of the samples\nthe peak field is greater than the base peak field. This\ncan be seen from the distribution curves for disorder in\nposition or radius alone. There are structures where the\ncombination of radius and position result in a 1% (or less)\neffective inward reduction of modal volume, leading to a\nslight increase in peak field. The combination of disorder\nis more likely to increase the modal volume or detune the\ncavity, therefore decreasing the peak field. This yields a\nskewed distribution where the maximum peak field for a\nstructure is 29 V\/m and a minimum peak field is close\nto zero. The mean peak field of the structures decrease\nalmost linearly with increasing magnitude of disorder.\nConsidering the distribution of the results of the reso-\nnant frequency analysis and comparing it to those of the\npeak field discussed above, the distribution for a disorder\nin both is less skewed and has a normal distribution.\nUsing the FDTD technique we also examined the qual-\nity factor of the disordered PBG resonant cavities. The\nquality factor is the ratio of the energy in the cavity to\nthe energy lost. We found that the introduction of disor-\nder has a small effect on the quality factor, in agreement\nwith the work of Zhu et al.23\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nFor disorders up to a maximum of 15% variation in po-\nsition and radius, we found that disorder applied to the\ninner-most rods surrounding the defect site dominates in\ndetermining the peak field and resonant frequency of the\nstructure. Disorder in all other rods, up to a maximum of\n15%, has a small effect on PBG performance. Although\ndisorder in the outer rods has a small effect on perfor-\nmance of the resonant structures, the presence of the\nouter rods are required for mode confinement. Smirnova\net al10 have shown that reducing the number of rings\nof rods in a PBG structure has an adverse effect on the\nability of the structure to propagate higher order modes\naway from the defect site and reduces the ability of struc-\nture to localize the mode of interest. In terms of absolute\nvariation, disorder leads to a larger variation in peak field\nthan in resonant frequency. A 5% disorder to both (ra-\ndius and position) leads to a maximum 0.5% variation in\nresonant frequency (40MHz) and a maximum 5% vari-\nation in peak electric field (1V\/m). This behaviour is\npredominantly determined by the disorder in ring 1 of\nthe rods only. Examination of the results show that a\n1% disorder in ring 1 has a greater effect than a 10% dis-\norder in all other rods. We have also shown that a small\ndisorder (\u223c1%) of the innermost ring of rods can actually\nlead to an increase in peak field, by decreasing the vol-\nume over which the energy of the EM field is distributed.\nIncreasing disorder leads to a decrease in the structures\naverage peak field, where as the mean resonant frequency\nremains constant with an increasing standard deviation.\nWe show how this behaviour is dependant on varying the\nradius and position of the rods, which detune the cavity.\nWe have found that randomly introduced disorder and\nsystematically moving individual rods, results in the abil-\nity to \u2018tune\u2019 the PBG structure and have found it possible\nto increase peak field by approximately 10%. This could\nprove beneficial in the design of PBG based accelerat-\ning structure where there is a requirement to maximize\nthe peak electric field and thereby maximize accelerating\ngradient.\nIn terms of structure fabrication, a maximum error in\nthe inner most ring of rods of 1% in separation, 5% in\nradius, and less than 10% disorder in all outer rods, leads\nto an average resonant frequency equal to the ideal struc-\nture (9.4072GHz) with a maximum variation of 0.2%\n(20MHz), and maximum variation of 0.5V\/m in the peak\nfield. To achieve this for the structure considered in this\npaper requires fabrication of the rods with a radius vari-\nation of 150\u00b5m, and a separation variation of 100\u00b5m for\nthe inner most ring of rods. This level of accuracy in\nfabrication although difficult is within the capability of\nmodern fabrication facilities.\n7VI.
