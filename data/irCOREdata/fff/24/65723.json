This re-emergence to \ncentre stage has reflected a number of developments. On the one hand, from \nbeing consigned for many years to the murky margins of the history of \ngeographical thought, somewhat surprisingly the region has come to occupy a \ncentral place in both social scientific discourse and political debates. At the \nsame time as it has experienced a revived status in geography, the \n  3 \nsignificance of the region \u2013 and, more generally of the spatial constitution of \neconomies and societies \u2013 came to be recognised as a critical issue in much \nof the social sciences: for example, in the core disciplines of economics \n(KRUGMAN, 2000), politics (KEATING et al, 2003) and sociology (URRY, \n1985) as well as in more applied areas of the social sciences such as \nbusiness studies (for example, PORTER, 2003; SNOWDON and \nSTONEHOUSE, 2006). Related to this, in the context of policy and practice, \nthe region has become seen as a \u2013 even the \u2013 key territorial unit in an era of \n(neo)liberal globalisation, the \u201cimagined unit of competition\u201d (LOVERING, 1998, \n392), linked to a variety of measures to devolve responsibility for regional \nsocio-economic development and well-being to the regional level. \n \nNot surprisingly, however, views have often differed quite sharply as to how \nbest to think about the region and about the merits of a regional approach to \nissues of governance and economic development, both between and among \npoliticians, citizens and intellectuals of various allegiances. For example, in \nJune 2006 the citizens of Catalonia voted for a significant extension of powers \nto the regional (or as many of them would see it, Catalan national) scale in a \nfurther step in the evolution of asymmetric federalism in Spain. This in turn \nprovoked a spate of similar demands in several other Spanish regions \n(Andalusia, the Balearic Islands, Galicia, and Valencia \u2013 the Basque country \nalready had greater autonomy than Catalonia) which feared that they would \nlose out as a result of greater autonomy in Catalonia. At the same time, the \nCatalan vote generated fears from other, smaller regions, with weaker claims \nto historic nationhood (such as Castile and Aragon), that they would lose out \n  4 \nas the map of uneven socio-economic development within Spain became \nmore sharply etched. In contrast, some eighteen months earlier in November \n2004 in north east England, a region with a long history of a certain sort of \nregionalist movement (see HUDSON, 2006a), though one grounded more in \nan economic definition of the region, especially in terms of state economic \nmanagement, rather than a regional political identity per se, the population \ndecisively rejected proposals for an elected Regional Assembly and an \nenhanced degree of devolution to the region. However, those voting against \nwere something of an unholy alliance  \u2013  some voted against because of \nopposition to greater devolution per se, others because they favoured \ndevolution but felt that what was on offer was a weak and problematic set of \nproposals that would be inadequate to begin effectively to tackle the \ndevelopmental problems of the region. Furthermore, there were genuine fears \nthat the proposed Assembly would simply offer central government an excuse \nto lay the blame for the region\u201fs continuing problems on people in the region, \na classic example of \u201eblaming the victim\u201f. Which viewpoint was correct, both in \nnorth east England and the various Spanish regions (if indeed one can talk in \nthose terms on such an issue), is not the point. The point is that \u201ethe region\u201f \nhad again become central to political debate, both as an object of state policy  \nand as a putative subject shaping and implementing state policy but with \nsharply divergent views as to both the efficacy and indeed propriety of the \nregion as both subject and object of policy. At the same time, however, there \nhas been a (not so?) subtle change in language and the linguistic \nrepresentation of the region: formerly \u201clagging\u201d regions are re-cast as \u201cunder-\nperforming\u201d or \u201cchallenged\u201d (BOSANQUET et al, 2006), while the emphasis \n  5 \nhas switched from addressing \u201csocial need\u201d to re-dressing \u201ceconomic under-\nperformance\u201d. \n \nSimilar divergences of view points and differences in emphasis are to be \nfound amongst academics interested in regional issues and uneven \ndevelopment. In part, these can be related to exploration of a range of \nevolutionary and institutional perspectives on regions and regional \ndevelopment that have allowed more nuanced interpretations of the \nconstitution of regions and regional development trajectories (for example, \nsee AMIN, 1999; HUDSON, 2005; MARTIN and SUNLEY, 2006). In this, a \nvariety of scholars have built upon the insights provided by Marxian political \neconomy \u2013 in particular an understanding of the way in which regional uneven \ndevelopment is structurally and necessarily inscribed within capitalist \ndevelopment (HARVEY, 1982) so that capital constantly \u201csee-saws\u201d between \nregions in search of enhanced profits (SMITH, 1984) - to provide more subtle \nelaborations of the relationship between the trajectories of individual regions \nand the broader map of regional uneven  development and the processes \nthrough which the specificities of particular regions are constructed \u2013 an issue \non which MASSEY\u201fs (1984) work was seminal.  \n \nHowever, unsurprisingly, opening up this conceptual space has produced a \nvariety of \u2013 sometimes competing - views rather than a consensus on one.  \nFor some, regions have become the key territorial units in an era of \nglobalisation (for example, see SCOTT, 1998; STORPER, 1995), although, \narguably, the focus on the region is being replaced by a revived interest in \n  6 \ncity-regions as the pivotal territorial unit (see SCOTT and STORPER, 2003; \nOECD, 2006). In either case, however, the emphasis is placed firmly upon \nendogenous growth processes, regional institutions and regionally-specific \nknowledges and learning \u2013 in short, on what has been termed the Territorial \nInnovations Models perspective on regional development (MOULAERT and \nSEKIA, 2003). Often, however, such claims are seen to be based upon \nempirically insubstantial evidence (MARKUSEN, 1999). In contrast, others \nwould dispute this alleged primacy of the region and, on theoretical as well as \nempirical grounds, insist that the national remains the key scale (for example, \nsee PIKE and TOMANEY, 2004) and that the significance of the regions as a \npivotal site of capital accumulation, economic growth and governance has \nbeen over-emphasised, as has been the significance of knowledge and \nlearning (for example, see HUDSON, 1999). The issue is not that the region is \n\u2013 or has suddenly become \u2013 unimportant but rather that any prioritising of the \nregion as the pivotal spatial scale and territorial unit should be based upon \ncareful and theoretically grounded empirical research rather than sweeping \narm waving assertion based upon thin empirics (although as I have argued \nelsewhere, it is important to recognise the varying qualitative as well as \nquantitative forms that valid evidence can take: see HUDSON, 2003). \nCertainly there are instances of regions that can seen as economically very \nsuccessful  \u2013 at least for some of their residents - as, for example, the case of \nSpain reveals but this is a far cry from the assertion that because some \nregions are successful, all can be successful in a \u201ewin-win\u201f world of bottom-up \nendogenous regional growth.  \n \n  7 \nAssociated with these differing views as to the centrality of the region to \nprocesses of economic growth and governance, there has been, again not \nsurprisingly, some quite heated intellectual debate as to the most appropriate \nway to conceptualise regions and about the status of regions, both \nconceptually and politically. Often this has become polarised around \ncompeting either\/or choices and two of these are of particular relevance. First, \nthere are views of regions as closed, bounded and homogeneous entities that \ncontrast with those of regions as open, permeable, and heterogeneous. \nSecondly, there are concepts of regions as objects of policy versus those of \nregions as subjects that influence, make and implement policy.  However, to \nsee these only as either\/or choices is counter-productive and would lead the \nstudy of regions and their development into a number of spacious, but \nultimately unproductive, cul-de-sacs.  Rather than take an either\/or \nperspective on these dichotomies, therefore, I argue that these must be seen \nfrom a both\/and perspective, and that, crucially, which of these perspectives is \nchosen or given most weight depends \u2013 or at least should depend \u2013 upon the \ntheoretical, political and practical contexts in which these choices are made. \nAs such, they also depend upon issues of power and, more specifically, who \nhas the power of decision in a number of key contexts.  \n \nThe concept of power is a tricky one, with a range of views as to how best to \nthink about power. As I have recently discussed these issues elsewhere (for \nexample, see HUDSON, 2006b) I will not repeat that discussion here, other \nthan to say that, drawing on the work of ALLEN (2003, 2004), three concepts \nof power can be identified. These varying conceptions stress different aspects \n  8 \nof power and the processes through which it is constituted and produced so \nthat different conceptions allow an illumination of different aspects of power \nand their relevance to regional issues. The first conception, drawing on critical \nrealism, is a \u201ecentred\u201f one of power as an inscribed capacity of individuals or \ninstitutions, which possess power by virtue of their constitutive social \nrelationships and which they can exercise as \u201epower over\u201f others. The second \nconception of power is a \u201enetworked\u201f conception. Power is conceived as a \nresource for achieving diverse ends, emphasising \u201epower to\u201f and the ways in \nwhich power is generated to achieve desired outcomes rather than how power \nconstrains action. The third conception of power is Foucauldian and \ndiagrammatic. Power is conceived as a technology - a series of strategies, \ntechniques and practices - that works on subjects. It is exercised though \ngroups or organisations rather than being held or possessed by them or \ncentred in them. Power is conceptualised as fluid and relational, exercised \nfrom innumerable points within civil society, the economy and the state \u2013 thus \nmany agencies and institutions are involved within productive networks of \npower rather than power being seen as resting only in the state and its \nagencies.  \n \nWhile recognising the value of these different conceptions of power, ALLEN \n(2003) nonetheless sees them as inadequate and flawed in various ways. In \nparticular, he argues that power is not a \u201ething\u201f but rather must be understood \nas a relational effect of social interaction inseparable from its effects, \nexpressed via diverse and specific modalities of power, each with its own \nparticularities and specificities, constituted differently in time and space. He \n  9 \nidentifies six modalities of power: domination; authority; seduction; coercion; \nmanipulation; and inducement. However, these are analytic distinctions so \nthat in practice they are combined in practical strategies and actions. In short, \nALLEN regards existing conceptions of power as requiring refinement, \nparticularly in terms of recognising distinctive modalities of power and their \nimplications fro the exercise of power over space and through time, not least \u2013 \nas illustrated by his analyses of places such as the City of London and \nPotsdammer Platz in Berlin \u2013 in relation to the (re)production of regions. \nEqually , however, it is important to remember the sites \u2013 and structural \nrelations \u2013 from which and through which these different modalities of power \nemanate ands are exercised.  \n \nIn the remainder of this paper I examine four, to a degree inter-weaving, sets \nof key questions in the context of a concern with who has the power of \ndecision, in both intellectual debates and regional policy and practice. First, \nhow is the region to be defined? Secondly, how can the concept of \ngovernmentality deepen our understanding of regions? Thirdly, how are \u201ethe \nregion\u201fs interests\u201f to be defined? And finally, how is regional economic \ndevelopment to be defined? Problematising what we mean by the terms \n\u201eregion\u201f and \u201edevelopment\u201f in these ways and posing and exploring questions \nsuch as these will allow the study of regions to be taken forward in a \nprogressive manner in the future. \n \nSubject or object of policy: how and by whom is the region to be defined?  \n \n  10 \nBroadly speaking, in policy discourses and academic commentaries upon and \ninterpretations of these, regions have been seen as either the object or the \nsubject of state policies, and sometimes as both simultaneously.  Although \nuntil recently the academic literature tended to focus upon regions as objects \nrather than subjects of policy, in fact there is  a long history of the practical \nconstruction of regions as subjects as well as objects of policy (for example, \nsee HUDSON, 2006a). \n \nTypically, the construction of the region as an object of (national) state policy \nrelies upon two processes. First, the demarcation of regional boundaries \u2013 the \nmetaphorical drawing of lines on the ground that mark out the space of the \nregion and\/or the construction of material markers to denote, literally  \u201eon the \nground\u201f, where one region ends and another begins. Regions in this sense \nare literally \u201cmarked out\u201d (cf. THRIFT, 2002). Secondly, the specification of a \nseries of statistical indicators that allows the socio-economic profile of the \nregion to be defined. Equally, these indicators allow changes in this profile, in \nthe region\u201fs development and in the extent to which it is defined as \n\u201eproblematic\u201f \u2013 as defined by these measures \u2013 to be assessed. As these are \nessentially central state policies for regions, such decisions about the drawing \nof boundaries, the definition of criteria against which regions are defined as \nproblematic or not, and the monitoring of the state of regions against these \ncriteria are taken (no doubt typically with some perfunctory consultation with \nrelevant social actors in the regions) by central state ministries and agencies.  \nIn them rests the authority to assume this power of decision. While these may \nhave administrative offices in the regions (as for example, with the post-1994 \n  11 \nGovernment Offices of the Regions in England), the key decisions are \ntypically taken by national government ministers and\/or bureaucrats and civil \nservants in national capitals, located at varying distances from the regions \naffected by them and clearly distant from the peripheral regions that have the \nmost serious developmental problems. Put in slightly different terms, this \ninvolves remote centres of calculation that monitor, discipline and govern \nregions \u201eat a distance\u201f (LATOUR, 1987) and on that basis reach decisions \nabout policy measures and as to the resources and developmental aid that is \nto be allocated to different regions (issues discussed more fully in the \nfollowing section).  \n \nIn part in response to this resurgence of political and popular interest in \nregions, there has, in recent years, undoubtedly been a growing emphasis in \nthe social science literature on regional devolution as one part of more \ngeneral processes of state \u201cre-organisation\u201d in many parts of the capitalist \nworld (JESSOP, 1997).  Pressures for greater regional devolution \u201efrom below\u201f \nhave been generated by regionalist and nationalist movements, seeking to \ncreate more powerful sub-national spaces of governance and regulation within \nthe boundaries of national states or \u2013 indeed \u2013 to create new national spaces. \nThis can involve challenges from within regions to the authority of central \ngovernment and to existing regional boundaries, and\/or challenges over the \ncriteria used to define regions, and\/or challenges as to the existing order in \nterms of who has the power to decide matters of regional interest and \nconcern. However, while there may have been \u201ebottom up\u201f pressures from \nwithin regions, in part a consequence of the powers of seduction and the \n  12 \npromise of greater regional autonomy, national states have not been innocent \nand passive by-standers in these processes of territorial decentralisation of \npower and\/or responsibilities. For example, states may seek to preserve the \nintegrity of their national territory via granting increased autonomy to regions \nwithin their boundaries or seek to contain fiscal crises by devolving responsibility \n(but not commensurate resources) for economic development to regions. While \nthere may well be political and social forces within regions arguing fro greater \ndevolution to them, it is important to acknowledge that regional devolution can \nhave negative as well as positive economic effects. Decentralisation can impose \neconomic costs in the form of efficiency disadvantages, equity-related \ndrawbacks and institutional burdens. Furthermore, many of the \ndisadvantageous effects are contingent upon which actors are driving \ndevolutionary policies and, as a result, the specific from that devolution takes.  \n(RODRIGUES-POSE and GILL, 2005). \n \nThese varied pressures for devolution have certainly reinforced or even, in some \ncases, initiated tendencies to shift regulatory practices from the national level \nand so qualitatively change relationships between national and regional levels. It \nis, however, important not to overstate the extent of such changes. There is a \nlong-established sub-national territorial structure to state power in many \ncapitalist states in response to requirements for administrative efficiency and \npolitical legitimacy, to say nothing of smooth accumulation. There are clear \nexamples demonstrating that the power to shape policies for regions has been \nshifted more to the regional level \u2013 as in Spain \u2013 with greater decentralisation, to \nsome regions at least, of the power to decide and of the resources to implement \n  13 \ndecisions. Rather than regions simply administering central government policies, \nregions construct and implement their own policies. This is intended to produce \na greater correspondence between administrative spaces and the meaningful \nspaces of the regional life world, albeit with regional boundaries determined in \nthe last analysis by central states. As a result, more complex architectures of \npolitical power and spaces of governing have emerged. However, again, it is \nimportant not to overstate the extent to which the \u201cpower to decide\u201d and \ncommensurate resources have been devolved to regions as opposed to the \nregional scale remaining one of importance for the administration of national \npolicies for the regions. It is worth emphasising that regional devolution involves \nrelative shifts in responsibility and power of decision and that these are heavily \ncircumscribed precisely because national states retain their authority and the \npower to make decisions as the extent and form of devolution.  \n \nAs well as such scalar shifts, there has also often been a re-definition of the \nboundaries of state activities associated with a change in emphasis from \ngovernment to governance in systems of governing. Regulatory capacities have \nbeen shifted \"outwards\" to non-state or \u201equasi-state\u201f organisations with \nenhanced significance placed upon social practices beyond the state. A range of \norganisations and institutions within civil society has been incorporated into \nprocesses of governance. This has been particularly associated with the \npromotion of network concepts and networked forms of regional governance \n(HADJIMICHALIS and HUDSON, 2006). The growing emphasis on governance \nis recognition of the increasing importance - or perhaps more accurately is \nincreasing recognition of the importance - of the institutions of civil society in \n  14 \nsecuring the conditions under which the (regional) economy is possible. The \ngrowing emphasis upon regionally networked forms of governance is grounded \nin a (typically tacit) assumption that networked forms of power at the regional \nscale are adequate to deal with the structural power of capital and to resolve \nregional development issues.  \n \nIn summary, then, the key issue is not so much the rise of the region and the \ndecline of the national state but rather the new forms of relationships between \nnational and regional. Integral to the reorganisation of the national state is the \nemergence of new, more complicated structures of governing, involving re-\ndefined relations between economy, society and state and complex links within \nmulti-scalar systems of governing. As LOVERING (1998, 392) acerbically notes, \nhowever, \u201cthe apparent resurgence of the region makes less sense as a \nphoenix-like re-emergence of regional economic crucibles than as the effect of \ntop-down policies to replace the \u201eimagined community\u201f at the national level with \nan \u201eimagined unit of competition\u201f at the regional level\u201d. However, despite the \nemergence of such new imaginaries, in practice national states are not eclipsed \nby resurgent regions and retain a key role as \u201cscale managers\u201d, shaping \ndecisions about scalar shifts in regulatory capacity, serving as authoritative \ncentres of both calculation and persuasion, performing as authors of narratives \nabout change and reform and as centres of interpretation and dissemination of \nknowledge about experiences elsewhere (PECK, 2003, 357).  The critical issue \nis not the demise but the character of the national state, the dominant modalities \nthrough which it continues to exercise power, the type of regulatory r\u00e9gime that \nit maintains, the geometry of that r\u00e9gime and the extent to which it involves \n  15 \ndevolution to the regional scale, and the form of capitalist economy that it seeks \nto encourage.  \n \nRegions and governmentality \n \nThe Foucauldian concept of governmentality (for example, see FOUCAULT, \n1991; DEAN, 1999) further illuminates the processes of reorganising the state \nand attempts to create the region as a political subject and the regional as a \nnew \u2013 or perhaps more accurately re-defined - scale of governing. While the \nemphasis on the national as the dominant space and spatial scale of \nregulation can be seen as expressive of one governmentality and ensemble of \nvarying modalities of power, the shift to concepts of multi-level governance \nand of re-defined boundaries between economy, civil society and state in the \nprocesses of governing can be seen as both indicative and constitutive of an \nalternative governmentality and combination of modalities. Not least, the \nspatial object of policy and the spaces of governing are seen to encompass \nmore than just the national. Acknowledging this, however \u2013 as exemplified by \nthe cases of Spain and the UK described in the introductory section \u2013 the shift \ntowards regions as modes and scales of governing remains contested, partial \nand uneven in its development. \n \nBy conjoining \u201egovernment\u201f and \u201ementality\u201f in a productive alliance, \ngovernmentality therefore emphasises the practical \u201ehow\u201f of governing and the \nstructures of government and governing, the way in which the thought \ninvolved in the practices of government is collective and relatively taken-for-\n  16 \ngranted, usually not open to questioning by its practitionersi. The existing \norder becomes naturalised and as such is not open for discussion. More \nspecifically, in the context of state policies and the governing of regions \u201cat a \ndistance\u201d, governmentality \u201cis intrinsically linked to the activities of expertise\u201d \n(MACKINNON, 2000, 296) and the authority that this provides. The purpose \nof deploying expertise is to enact \u201cassorted attempts at the calculated \nadministration of diverse aspects of conduct through the countless, often \ncompeting, local tactics of education, persuasion, inducement, management, \nincitement, motivation and encouragement\u201d rather than to seek to weave \u201can \nall-pervasive web of \u201esocial control\u201f\u201d. Moreover, space is an important element \nof governmentality, precisely because such governmental activities are \nterritorially-demarcated. For in order to \u201cto govern it is necessary to render \nvisible the space over which government is to be exercised. And this is not \nsimply a matter of looking: space has to be re-presented, marked out\u201d \n(THRIFT, 2002, 205), emphasising that regions need to be defined, \nrepresented and their boundaries (literally or metaphorically) marked out, as \nboth objects and subjects of governing.  \n \nThis focuses attention upon those with the power to define and represent in \nthese ways. Rather than unquestioningly accept the claims of those who \nassert their right to speak for the region, the spotlight is turned on their \nactivities, the modalities of power that they deploy in pursuit of this right \u2013 \nmanipulation and coercion as much as, if not more than, authority and \ndomination \u2013 and the basis on which they claim the right to act in this way \nproblematises. In short, the black box of the region is opened up in order to \n  17 \nexplain how it can perform as a political subject with shared regional interests \nvia uncovering the bases of the formation of a dominant or hegemonic \nregional bloc.  The creation of such a cohesive regional bloc is a result of the \nsuccessful realisation of specific regional projects that unite diverse social \nactors, with otherwise differing or competing interests, around a distinct line of \naction that becomes defined as the regional interest. However, achieving such \nunity is always a contingent matter. As such, unity is always provisional. Even \nif unity is achieved and maintained for a time, however, there is no guarantee \nthat such projects will always and only have their intended effects precisely \nbecause of the inability to anticipate the emergent properties of practices.  \n \nThe concept of governmentality has several further significant consequences \nrelating to issues of regions, regional policies and regional devolution. The \nfirst relates to the constitution of the objects, subjects and spaces of \ngovernment. For example, regional economies are constituted via regional \nstatistics, which have a key role in \u201emaking economies visible\u201f and constituting \nthem as objects for policy action. The capability to decide upon these defining \nstatistical measures is clearly a critical issue. Secondly, LATOUR (1987, 237-\n40) emphasises the key role of \u201ccentres of calculation\u201d, critical nodes in which \ninformation on distant objects is brought together, compared, combined, and \naggregated via use of mathematical and statistical techniques, thereby \nenabling government to \u201dact at a distance\u201d on objects, such as regions, \nthrough its programmes and policies. Put slightly differently, \u201cthrough a \nprocess of mobilization, the truth claims of accredited authority figures, under \nthe guise of neutrality and efficiency, set out the norms of conduct that enable \n  18 \ndistant events and people to be governed at arms\u201f length\u201d (ALLEN, 2003, \n141). Thirdly, it highlights \u201cthe specific mechanisms, procedures and tactics \nassembled and deployed as particular programmes are materialised\u201d \n(MACKINNON, 2000, 295) and through which governmental programmes are \nactivated and put into practice. Particular techniques and practices become \ngovernmental because they can be made practical, transformed into concrete \ndevices for managing and directing reality. Inscription (for example, writing \ndown agreed quantitative targets for regional economic growth) and \ncalculation are key technologies, \u201cresponsibilising\u201d and disciplining actors to \nthe claims of central authority (ROSE, 1996). These technologies render \nreality \u2013 and in this particular context, regions - \u201cstable, mobile, comparable, \ncombinable\u201d, enabling government to act on it (ROSE, and MILLER, 1992, \n185).  \n \nSuch moves are not unproblematic, theoretically or practically, however. For \nexample, there is a danger that a governmental perspective encourages a \nview of power as all-pervasive, found everywhere, expressed via a seemingly \ninfinite variety of practices and techniques, such that any sense of hierarchy \nor structure in terms of the relative importance of different sources of power \nslips from view. Furthermore, there are tensions between decentralisation to \nregions and the development of new managerial technologies at national level \nto steer the activities of regional agencies and ensure that they deliver \nnational policy objectives. Regional spaces become simultaneously objects \nand subjects of national government, and via \u201cthe combination of flexibility \nand standardisation (that is, different levels, same targets) \u2026 gives \n  19 \ngovernmental technologies their utility as instruments for managing space\u201d \n(MacKinnon, 2000, 309). However, there is no guarantee that targets will be \nattained (witness the continuing problematic status of many peripheral \nregions). Moreover, granting a degree of autonomy to enable regions to \nbecome political subjects also creates the possibility of forming enclosures, \ntightly bound sites of vigorously defended professional expertise that are \nresistant to the wishes of government (ROSE and MILLER, 1991). Thus an \nunintended consequence of empowering experts \u201cin and for\u201d regions may be \nto create the capacity to resist the intentions of central government towards \nthose regions as objects of its policies. There may well be irreconcilable \ndifferences between \u201cauthority voices\u201d (O\u201fMALLEY, 2000), the \u201eexperts\u201f \nenrolled  by national and regional organisations, respectively. Equally, it may \ncreate capacity, or at least the space in which such capacity might emerge \nand evolve, for the elaboration \u2013 although not necessarily the implementation \n- of alternative regional projects, indicative of the more general contradictory \ntendencies that plague state policies. However, such creative capacity may \nwell be lacking of fail to emerge in the space created for it, especially in those \nregions that have a history of economic decline and selective put-migration of \ntheir most talented residents. As a result of this, and institutional sclerosis, \nthere may well be a lack of research capacity to analyse and interpret \ndevelopmental tendencies and design context-specific policies that best suit \nthe situation of specific regions in the face of these broader forces, even when \ngiven the chance to do so (for example, see OECD, 2006). As a result, \nregions \u2013 or, more precisely, key actors in government departments and \norganisations and related development bodies drawn from the cast of \u201eusual \n  20 \nsuspects\u201f - often fall back upon a limited set of consultants and \u201cexperts\u201d, who \nare seen as the sole repositories of authoritative and relevant knowledge,  to \nproduce strategies that see all regions, irrespective of their varied conditions \nand histories, as seeking to mimic \u201cthe global leaders\u201d or to grow more rapidly \nthan the national average while pursuing generically similar policies and \npractices \n \nHow are we to conceptualise the processes through which \u201ethe region\u201f and \n\u201ethe region\u201fs interests\u201f are constructed? \n \nIn the previous section, I emphasised that the construction of a region as a \nsocio-material ensemble and of a \u201eregional interest\u201f is always, necessarily, \nprovisional, precisely because it is the product of a social process. Indeed, \nthis process may well involve conflict and differing views and, as JESSOP \n(1990) emphasises, objects (and one might add, subjects) of regulation are \nnot fully constitutes prior to the struggles over their regularisation but are \npartially constituted through them. Essentialist conceptions of regions are no \nlonger intellectually tenable. Regions are not \u201eout there\u201f waiting to be \ndiscovered. They are socially constructed, both discursively and materially, in \nrelation to specific criteria. However, it is important to acknowledge that \npolitical actors and particular interest groups may seek to define and defend \nregions in essentialist terms and it is important to understand why this is so, \nand this is relevant in relation to arguments about regions and regional \ndevelopment. Not least, the claim that regions can and should become active \nsubjects rather than passive objects of policy often rests on assertions as to \n  21 \nsome essential regional (or national) identity, often mobilised around some \nperceived injustice or inequality. \n \nThis recent re-thinking of the region is predicated upon a strongly relational \napproach. Regions are seen as constituted from spatialised social relations, \nstretched out over space and materialised in various forms, and also through \nrepresentational narratives about them (for example, see AMIN, 2004). The \nspatiality of the dynamics of capitalism, the uneven geographies of its  \nmechanisms of growth and decline and the stories told about them, represent \none way of conceptualising the processes underlying the (re)construction of \nregions. Regions can be seen as products of complex condensations of social \nrelationships, of varying density and variety, which combine contingently in \nspecific time\/space couplings to produce what are, in the last analysis, unique \nregions but regions with fuzzy and permeable boundaries. The simultaneous \ncombined and uneven development of particular regions reflects a shifting \nengagement with mechanisms of growth and decline as these are stretched \nover space in the flux of real historical time (HARVEY, 1982). \n \nThis relational approach therefore provides a way of thinking that challenges \nthe view of the region as a coherent bounded territorial entity and discloses a \nregion which is by no means necessarily a whole, with the characteristics of \ncoherence which that term implies; nor is it necessarily a bounded and closed \nentity. Thinking about a region in terms of stretched out social relationships \nreveals a complex and unbounded lattice of articulations constructed through \nand around relations of power and inequality. It is a discontinuous lattice, \n  22 \npunctured by structured exclusions, with intra-regional variation \u201cbecause of \nthe uneven nature of the overlay of different [defining] criteria\u201d (ALLEN et al., \n1998, 55-6). While the region becomes the nexus of a variety of social \nrelationships and of modalities of power, the spatial reach of these \nrelationships differs and therefore there can be no presumption that regional \nboundaries defined on the basis of different criteria will coincide. Each \nrelational network has its own spatial reach, but while these may not be \ncoincident, they may nonetheless mutually influence one another. Intra-\nregional heterogeneity and discontinuity implies that, metaphorically, the \nfabric of regions is torn and ragged.  Consequently, the issue is not how and \nwhether to draw lines around regions but to seek to understand the processes \nthrough which they are (re)produced (HUDSON, 1990).  \n \nThere is no doubt that thinking about regions in these relational terms is \nproductive. However, ALLEN et al. (1998, 143) have gone further and claimed \nthat an adequate understanding of regions can \u201conly\u201d come about through \nconceptualising them as open, discontinuous, relational and internally diverse, \nthereby dismissing the notion of regions as bounded territories and \nsuggesting that the territorial and the relational are either\/or conceptionsii. \nThere is undoubtedly ample empirical evidence that, on average, the \nfrequency, intensity and spatial reach of such extra-regional connections have \ntended to increase as the social relationships of capitalism have become \nmore stretched and re-defined spaces in new ways. However, the density and \ngeography of linkages can decline as well as increase in particular regions \u2013 \nfor example, because of devalorisation and disinvestment decisions by \n  23 \ntransnational companies or political decisions to seek a greater degree of \nregional closure precisely because of the character of extra-regional relations, \nlinkages and distanciated network relationships and the risks that these are \nseen to pose to the economic and social life of the region. Indeed recent \nresearch (see PIKE et al, 2006) has suggested that emphasising openness \nand connectivity as essential pre-requisites for regional economic growth may \nlead to problems of leakage, dispersal and structural incoherence in regional \neconomies, thereby \u2013 albeit unintentionally \u2013 undermining their viability. \nRecognising these risks, social and political actors often seek to increase the \nextent of regional closure and represent regions as closed, continuous and \ninternally homogeneous and, as such, more viable policy objects and \nlegitimate subjects seeking to shape policy. Consequently, while many of the \nsocial relations that help constitute regions traverse their immanent \nboundaries and enrol extra-regional actors in the process of regionalisation, \nthese trans-boundary relationships may, in some cases, to help produce \ncoherent bounded regions and what may be termed \u201cclosure\u201d (see also \nHUDSON, 2001, Chapter 8). The spatial extent of the territories to be \nenclosed can vary with context and purpose so that a scalar hierarchy of \nterritories (generically, sub0national, national, and supra-national) may and, \ncharacteristically, often does emerge as a result. \n \nThus in contrast to ALLEN et al (1998) I would argue that the relational and \nthe (hierarchically scalar) territorial can be seen as both\/and rather than \neither\/or conceptions, and that \u201eterritorially embedded\u201f and \u201erelational and \nunbounded\u201f conceptions of regions are complementary alternatives, and that \n  24 \nactually existing regions are a product of a struggle and tension between \nterritorialising and de-territorialising processes.  Depending upon the \ncircumstances and the specific situation of particular regions, policy and \npolitics may be informed by a bounded territorial and hierarchical conception \nor by a relational conception that emphasises a flat ontology of networked \nconnections as the more appropriate perspective from which to view the \nregion.. \n \nHow is regional economic development to be defined? \n \nFor much of the time and for many people, the definition of regional economic \ndevelopment is a non-issue: the meaning and substance of \u201ethe economy\u201f is \nseen as self-evident. The development of a regional economy is defined by \ngrowth in output, especially productivity and output per caput, and if this is \naccompanied by some growth in employment, so much the better. However, \nthe key indicators of development are output and productivity \u2013 or in other \nwords, regional economic development is defined as regional economic \ngrowth, and growth in the formal mainstream economy at that. There is \nnothing inherently \u201ewrong\u201f with such a definition but it does severely \ncircumscribe thinking about, and the definitions of, both \u201eeconomy\u201f and \n\u201edevelopment\u201f. Given this rather emaciated and limited mainstream definition \nof economic development, it is important to recognise that many regions are \ndoomed to under-perform against centrally-set targets and in relation to \nnational growth rates. Uneven development is an integral component of \ncapitalist economies and while some regions will exceed national (or other) \n  25 \ngrowth rates and targets, others will not. In other words some will \u201efail\u201f as part \nof the price of others \u201esucceeding\u201f. Consequently, there is no \u201ewin-win\u201f neo-\nliberal golden age leading to regional convergence, let alone even \ndevelopment \n \nFurthermore, the mainstream view pays scant, if any, attention to issues of \nconsumption, living conditions and lifestyle and to distributional issues as \ncentral to development, and there are strong grounds for arguing that issues \nof social and environmental justice and equity must be central to any \nsustainable economic development strategy. Indeed, issues such as quality of \nfood ad life, linked to regionalised supply chains, are finding their way onto the \ndevelopmental agenda as part of alternative \u201cbottom up\u201d approaches to \ndevelopment policy in several parts of Europe (HADJIMICHALIS and \nHUDSON, 2007). Such shifts in thinking are important because even in those \nsuccessful regions \u2013 not least the \u201esuperstar\u201f regions (PERRONS, 2004, 202-\n37) - that are deemed to have \u201esucceeded\u201f, there are issues of intra-regional \ninequality, poverty, and  poor living and environmental conditions as a \nconsequence of the inequitable distributions of the \u201egoods\u201f and \u201ebads\u201f that are \nintegral to the practices of the capitalist economy (for example, see MASSEY, \n2006). This emphasises that regions, both in general and in relation to \nparticular regions, are amenable to multiple simultaneous representation, as \nboth \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d, \u201csuccessful\u201d and \u201cfailing\u201d, depending upon the \naudience, context and purpose. \n \n  26 \nMoreover, the mainstream view defines substantial swathes of socially-useful \nactivity that can be summarised under rubrics such as the social economy, or \nThird Sector, as irrelevant to the development debate. Defining \u201edevelopment\u201f \nin terms of GDP\/caput and productivity in the mainstream economy squeezes \nout consideration of a range of social economy approaches, from \u201enear \nmarket\u201f social enterprises to more traditional voluntary sector charities that \nhave the capacity to create socially useful work, producing socially useful \nproducts and services, but within metrics other than those of the mainstream \neconomy. While surpluses may be produced, they do not become profits \u2013 \nthey may be expressed in metrics such as units of time, for example, or \ndistributed via non-monetary exchange. Eliminating such activities from the \ndefinition of \u201eeconomy\u201f is a quite critical manoeuvre as such activities are \noften proportionally of greater importance in regions that have become \nperipheral to the main circuits of capital accumulation and the mainstream \neconomy. It is, therefore, important that the economy be re-thought to include \nrather than exclude them and for regional development policy to reflect this \nmovement. Put another way, re-thinking \u201cthe economy\u201d in these ways \nforegrounds the central political question of \u201cwho counts in the economy?\u201d \n \nThere is some evidence of exploring such policy solutions and conceptions  \nbut, typically, very much as a last resort, part of a politics of despair to be tried \nonly when all else has failed in problem regions. Often such moves reflect \ndeep concern by national (and to a degree in the EU, supra-national quasi-) \nstates to legitimate their own position by being seen to act (if not care), of \nhaving tried the mainstream solutions and found them seriously wanting, to be \n  27 \nopen to new and different policy approaches, rather than expressing a \ngenuine commitment to exploring alternative paths and trajectories to those of \nthe mainstream economy and conceptions of development. Moreover, the \nimpoverished condition of these regions militates against the development of \na vibrant social economy there, even more so if this is seen as a subversive \ndevelopment, undermining the mainstream.  \n \nAs well as re-thinking the economy in these ways, there is also a need to re-\nthink development so as, for example, to give much more weight to questions \nof distribution and equity and issues such as health and well-being (PIKE et \nal, this issue). Not least, this helps recover consideration of the question of \nwhat the economy is for, what its social purposes are and ought to be, what \nvalues and principles inform and underlie conceptions of development, rather \nthan there being a one-dimensional concern with growth per se. This in turn \ncould, for example, encompass a greater sensitivity to issues of \nenvironmental and social justice and sustainability as central to the regional \ndevelopmental agendaiii. Put another way, re-thinking \u201cdevelopment\u201d in these \nways foregrounds the central political questions of \u201cdevelopment for whom?\u201d \u2013 \na question rendered more complex and slippery as a result of recognition of \nthe multiple and shifting identities of individuals -, of \u201dwhose values and \nprinciples shape the dominant conceptions of development and how do they \ndo so?\u201d  and \u201cthrough which modalities of power are these dominant \nconceptions established and secured?\u201d. \n \nRecognising the limits to the region and the regional \n  28 \n \nCreating the space for these re-thought and revised conceptions of region, \neconomy and development to become the basis of new forms of regional \npolicies and practice will certainly require a parallel radical re-thinking of \nappropriate forms of politics and a thorough critique of the modalities of power \nthrough which they are practised. The \u201eold\u201f models of representative \ndemocracy certainly remain relevant but there is a pressing need both to re-\nvamp them and to build upon and go beyond them. This would involve \u2013 inter \nalia - exploring more participatory forms of democratic practice and opening \nup more open and transparent fora for political decision making beyond as \nwell as within the formal structures of party politics. In many regions, \nespecially those blighted by economic decline and characterised by a degree \nof introspection and political conservatism, this may prove the biggest \nchallenge of all. The dominance of politics and policy decision making by \u201ethe \nusual suspects\u201f, those familiar but shadowy dominant figures in both public \nand private sectors (typically male, middle-aged and grey-suited) who \nregularly appear as the decisive actors who reach the key decisions behind \nclosed doors and who pursue their interests via coercion, inducement and \nmanipulation as well as appeals to that more visible authority, needs to be \nbroken (for example, see ROBINSON et al, 2000). \n \nWhile recognising the positive developmental potential that may, therefore,  \nbe embodied in a \u201eregional\u201f approach to development, it is equally important to  \nrecognise the limits to the regional, and insist that the national state continues \nto acknowledge its responsibilities for the social and economic well-being of \n  29 \nits citizens, wherever they live. For example, as RODRIGUEZ\u2013POSE and \nGILL (2004, 2115) conclude, \u201c(regional) devolution per se will \u2026not deliver \ngreater territorial equity. This objective would require the establishment of \nsubstantial interterritorial fiscal equalisation systems at the national or \nsupranational level if the persistence and permanence of economic disparities \nare not to become one of the hallmarks of future geographies\u201d. More \ngenerally, the national state remains pivotal and often decisive in shaping the \ncharacter and extent of sub-national governance and economic and social \ndevelopment (PIKE and TOMANEY, 2004, 2093). Acknowledging the force of \nthis point, however, it is equally important to stress that the state apparatus \ncannot be simply and non-problematically \u201ecaptured\u201f to address the needs of \nthe mass of the population of peripheralised regions. The key issues then \nbecome the architecture of the system of governing, the social bases of power \nand its distribution, and the modalities of the power relations between the \nregional and national within, but also beyond, the structures of the state.  \n \nFinally, and perhaps most importantly of all, it is vital that re-thinking of the \nregion acknowledges and seeks to deal with two messy but vital political \nrealities. First, the enduring dilemmas of seeking to pursue simultaneously a \npolitics of recognition that recognises respects the legitimacy of regional \nidentities and peoples\u201f identification with \u201ctheir region\u201d and one of \nredistribution that seeks to reduce, if not eliminate, material disparities in \neconomic well-being and living conditions between regions (see Fraser, \n1995). Secondly, that this re-thinking escapes the myth of a unified (and \nunifying) regional interest and explicitly acknowledges the existence different - \n  30 \nand at times openly competitive, grounded in different class structural \npositions and other sources of social power \u2013 interests held by individuals and \nsocial groups living in the same space. Within such an agonistic politics, \nwhich interests prevail and which are prioritised in state policy agendas would \nbe seen as the outcome of overtly political struggle based on a recognition of \nlegitimate (or at least legally sanctioned) difference \u2013 often grounded in \nstructurally asymmetrical power relations - rather than a presumption of \nhomogeneity of interest on the basis of a shared regional identity. Recognition \nof this emphasises that progress towards greater territorial justice would need \nto unpack the modalities of power that underwrite existing injustices and \ngrapple with more complex spatialities than simply those of inter-regional \nrelations.  \n \nIn this context it is worth noting the radical experiments in \u201cparticipatory \nbudgeting\u201d that originated in Porto Alegre in Brazil in the late 1980s and \nsubsequently diffused to other locations, including several in Europe (see \nHADJIMICHALIS and HUDSON, 2007). Via this process of radical re-\ndefinition of the democratic involvement,  citizens are actively involved in the \ndecision-making processes that shapew the regions in which they live. \n \nConclusions? \n \n\u201eConclusions\u201f is perhaps rather too grand a term so let me simply end by \nsaying that it seems to me that in thinking about the future of studies of the  \nregion and regional development, these are some of the sorts of issues that \n  31 \ncritical social scientists need to focus upon. But because these are issues that \nreach into the fabric of daily life for many people, especially those in those \nregions designated as \u201eperipheral\u201f \u2013 indeed even \u201eultra-peripheral\u201f, such as \nthe Azores and Canaries in the EU (EURISLES, 2002) -  they have a \nsignificance that reaches far beyond the realms of the academy and academic \ndebate. Above all, they are \u2013 and need to be seen as \u2013 political issues that, \nmoreover, often raise quite profound questions about modalities of power, the \nnature of politics and the political process itself. On the one hand, regions and \nthe people resident in them have typically been seen as both subjects \nvulnerable to the whim of capital\u201fs (dis)investment decisions and as the \nobjects of state policies that, ostensibly at least, were intended to counter the \nworst effects of capital flight and place specific devalorisation. On the other \nhand, moves to decentralise responsibility \u2013 and maybe even power and \nresources, or perhaps more accurately, as ALLEN (2003) would have it, the \neffects of power that resources of various sorts enable \u2013 to regions to allow \npeople there better to formulate their own socio-economic development \nstrategies typically presume the existence of a shared regional interest \u2013 \nwhich is rarely if ever a valid assumption \u2013 and run the risk that the blame for \ncontinuing socio-economic development problems will thereby be shifted to \nthe region and its inhabitants. What is needed is a rather different model and \nunderstanding of politics and practice that recognises that simply living in the \nsame region does not confer identity of interest but also that in many regions \nthe regional capacity to shift regional development trajectories onto a \u201ehigher \nand better\u201f path is strictly limited precisely because of their location within the \nstructural relations of capitalist development. . \n  32 \n \nAs a result, there is an enduring need for the analytic perspectives of political \neconomy that emphasise the systemic character of regional uneven \ndevelopment in order better to understand these limits. Equally, there needs \nto be a multi-scalar policy response that conjoins regional, national and supra-\nnational state policies in an intelligent way and that maybe also links these \npolices to the activities of a range of non-state organisations to address \nproblems in specific regions. In turn, such a shift of policy and practice \nrequires a conceptualisation of regions as social and material constructions, \nas path-dependent but always provisional and emergent rather than final, as \nencompassing variety and heterogeneity of interest, and as necessarily open \nand linked to other regions. Without falling into the trap of equating path \ndependency with a deterministic iron law of history, it is important to recognise \nthat historical legacies are important and that path dependency constrains \u2013 if \nnot determines \u2013 the future developmental possibilities of regions. In short, \nmoving towards a more even map of regional development will be \u2013 at best \u2013 \na long drawn out process, characterised by at least as many steps backwards \nand sideways as forwards in the search for a politics that both recognises and \nrespects the right to regional identity and specificity while seeking to redress \nthe material inequalities of regional uneven development and wrestles with \nthe dilemmas of seeking to deal simultaneously with issues of recognition and \nredistribution (cf. FRASER, 1995). \n \nIndeed, recognising these enduring dilemmas, it is important to emphasise \nthat there is not a single \u201chigh road\u201d to which there is no alternative and to \n  33 \nwhich all must aspire \u2013 and so strive and compete for the resources seen as \nessential to attaining this goal. Arguments that this is the case, that there is no \nalternative, need to be vigorously contested. Certainly there are limits that are \nan unavoidable consequence of the dominance of capitalist social relations \u2013 \nand in this sense very limited scope for transformatory as opposed to \naffirmative political strategies (FRASER, 1995) - but this does not mean that \nthere are no possibilities for political choices within these parameters. So, in \ncontrast, and instead of deterministic inevitability, the emphasis should be \nplaced firmly upon political choice and the political possibilities offered by \nrecognition of multiple paths and developmental trajectories and modalities of \npower, upon the potential for context-dependent and sensitive policies that \nacknowledge both varying historical trajectories and the constraints and \npossibilities that these present to future development, and upon the varying \naspirations and goals of regional residents.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nMy thanks to Andy Pike and to three anonymous for full and constructive \ncomments on an earlier draft, to which I\u201fve attempted to respond.
