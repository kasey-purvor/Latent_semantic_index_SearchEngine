This has led to calls for an\necosystem-based approach to management [3] particularly in the\nfields of fisheries [4], forestry [5] and wildlife management.\nAttempts to develop suitable ecosystem models have struggled with\ntechnical problems and lack of data [6], [7]. As a result, focus has\nshifted towards the identification of relatively easily measured\nmetrics that reflect the overall status of ecosystems [8]. These\nmetrics are useful for monitoring the impacts of management but\nprovide little biological insight. Dynamic ecosystem models are\ntherefore still necessary if the potential effects of different\nmanagement options are to be evaluated. Quantitative descrip-\ntions of the interactions between generalist predators and their\nprey are a key component of these models [9].\nSuch quantitative descriptions of the trophic links in biological\ncommunities are formulated mathematically using functional\nresponse models. For example, Holling [10] proposed the following\nequation for a system in which a predator preys on one type of\nprey, whose abundance can be given in terms of biomass or\nnumbers and is denoted by q. The consumption rate (F) by a single\npredator (biomass or items consumed per unit time) is\nF~\naq\n1zatq\n\u00f01\u00de\nHere t is the time taken by the predator to handle one item of\nprey. The parameter a represents the encounter rate between\npredators and prey that might be observed at very low prey density\n(i.e. the probability of a foraging predator encountering a prey item\nin one unit of time, given that the predator is searching throughout\nthat time). Note that at these low prey densities, the predator does\nnot spend any significant time handling prey items. At high prey\ndensity, the time spent by the predator in handling or consuming\nprey limits its consumption rate to 1\/t.\nNote that if prey abundance is known only by index q, where q\nis proportional to the \u2018true\u2019 abundance of prey then we can write\nq~wN , then\nF~\naq\n1zatq\n~\nawN\n1zawtN\n~\nbN\n1zbtN\n\u00f02\u00de\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 5 | e10761\nHere, the parameter b incorporates a proportionality constant and\ncan no longer be interpreted simply as an encounter rate.\nThis model can be further modified to allow for the possibility\nthat encounter rates may change with prey abundance e.g. if\npredators are more likely to actively search for prey when that prey\nis abundant, or if prey have a refuge [11]. In one model this\nrelationship is expressed as b~aNm{1 [12] [13] and we can then\nwrite\nF~\naNm\n1zatNm\n\u00f03\u00de\nNote here that whenm=1, encounter rate is independent of prey\ndensity, a~b, and equation (3) is equivalent to equation (2). When\nm.1, then encounter rate varies with prey density and a is a\nparameter that relates encounter rate to Nm21. We refer to this as\n\u2018the attack rate coefficient\u2019, and this is distinct from the encounter\nrate a used in equation (1).\nEq. (3) is a versatile expression which can be simplified to\ncorrespond with several commonly-used FR equations [14]. If\nm=1 and t=0, we obtain a linear (Type 1) FR ; if m=1 and t.0,\nwe obtain a hyperbolic (Type 2) FR; and if m.1, the FR is\nsigmoidal (Type 3). Therefore, this simple formulation can\npotentially take into account biological complexity such as the\nuse of refuge areas by prey, which can reduce encounter rates\nwhen prey density is low [15].\nThe form of the predator\u2019s functional response (the value of m)\nmay have important implications for prey populations. When\nm=1 (i.e. for a classic Holling type 2 functional response model)\nthen at low densities of prey, the consumption rate F is\nproportional to prey abundance N (with a being the constant of\nproportionality). The per capita mortality rate for prey (or the\nprobability that one prey item is taken in unit time) decreases as\nthe prey become abundant because predators are fully \u2018occupied\u2019\nin handling prey and cannot increase their consumption rate\nbeyond the asymptotic limit 1\/t. Therefore if prey that is initially\nabundant becomes scarce, while the population of predators\nremains constant, then the predation pressure on the remaining\nprey intensifies.\nWhere m.1, the predator-induced mortality has the potential\nto create a \u2018predator pit\u2019 for prey populations. It is still true that\nmortality of prey is reduced at high prey densities due to\nasymptotic predator consumption rates, and also true that\npredation pressure intensifies if abundant prey become scarce.\nHowever, at low prey densities, attack rates also decrease. It is then\npossible that prey mortality may be reduced at low prey density.\nAs a result, it may be possible for prey to exist at low density in a\n\u2018predator pit\u2019. If the population increases about this level,\npredation pressure intensifies.\nFor a good explanation of these effects, including graphical\nexplanation, see [16].\nThese arguments are developed under the assumption that the\nnumber of these specialist predators remains constant i.e. changes\nin prey mortality result only from the effects of the predator\u2019s\nfunctional response. However, if predator numbers change with\nprey density (i.e. if the predator shows a numerical response) then\nmortality rates will be affected and the consequences of predation\nfor the prey population may be more complex [17].\nGeneralists consume more than one type of prey. We expect\nthat consumption of any given prey (say, prey type 1) will depend\non the availability of this and other prey in the system i.e. the\nmortality rate for prey type 1 will be reduced if an alternative prey\ntype is present. Under the classic Holling functional response\nmodel, this effect is considered to be an outcome of the time spent\nby the predator in handling items of alternative prey which\nreduces the available time for encounters with prey 1. In the\nstandard fomulations used in fishery models [12] the parameter a\nis often interpreted in terms of \u2018suitability\u2019 or \u2018preference\u2019. If we\nallowm.1 then preferences change with relative prey abundance\n[18].\nFi~\naiNi\nmi\n1z\nPn\nj~1\najtjNj\nmj\n\u00f04\u00de\nHere, n is the number of prey species and all notation is now prey-\nspecific [18], [19].\nBecause a generalist predator is able to adapt its diet and exploit\ndifferent prey types, the dynamics of generalist predators are not\nnecessarily tightly coupled to those of any one of their prey [20]\nand it is likely that the numerical response of predator populations\nwill, like the functional response, be driven by the availability of\nmore than one type of prey. Generalists may have dramatic effects\non prey populations: they may dampen or eliminate cyclical\ninteractions between specialist predators and their prey [21], hold\nprey populations at low density in predator pits [22] [23], drive\nrare species to extinction [24], [16], and help to prevent ecological\nmeltdown [25]. The occurrence of these effects depends on the\nform of the predator\u2019s functional and numerical responses [26].\nTo model the role of generalist predators in community\ndynamics we need to describe their response to the abundance\nof all their prey species. Consumption rates are modelled using\nMSFRs [27]. However, there have been few attempts to fit\nMSFRs to field data because of the technical difficulties involved\nand because there is a widespread belief that no suitable data sets\nare available [28]. Here, we show how one type of MSFR can be\nfitted to field data on the consumption by a generalist predator (the\nhen or northern harrier Circus cyaneus) of its three most important\nprey species (the red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, the meadow\npipit Anthus pratensis, and the field vole Microtus agrestis) at 11\ndifferent combinations of prey density [29]. The red grouse is an\neconomically important quarry in the UK, where hen harriers are\nclassified as endangered species but are illegally killed [30] because\nof their perceived impact on grouse abundance [31].\nMethods\nThe methods of data collection for our study are fully explained\nin [32]. We summarise this information here to set the context for\nour statistical analysis, and then go on to present the statistical\napproach used to estimate the functional response parameters.\nThe Data\nWe consider populations of hen harriers that breed on UK\ngrouse moors. UK moorland is upland habitat, generally\ncharacterised by wet acidic soils and heather (Calluna vulgaris).\nFemale hen harriers hunt over these areas throughout the year,\nalthough males often winter elsewhere. Harriers return to their\nbreeding sites in spring and generally make their nests in tall\nheather [33]. Adult birds can consume a wide variety of prey but\nduring the breeding season prey items delivered to nest for hen-\nharrier chicks tend to be dominated by meadow pipits, voles and\nred grouse chicks (adult grouse are rarely consumed during\nsummer).\nThe data for this study were collected between 1992 to 1996 on\n6 study moors in Scotland, and with additional data from a subset\nof sites in 1988. In total, 11 separate estimates of predation rates at\ndifferent combinations of prey density were obtained. The\nFunctional Response\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 5 | e10761\nmethods used to obtain estimates of both predation rates and prey\ndensity are described briefly below. Details on the data collection\nare given in [34], [35].\nHarrier diet was recorded by observers watching from hides set\nclose to hen harrier nests over thousands of hours. The number\nand type of prey brought to the nest by parent birds was noted.\nNests were observed during weeks 1 to 4 of the breeding season\nduring which time it is estimated that 89% of prey items could be\ncorrectly identified [32]. Unidentified prey tended to be small and\nquickly consumed.\nPrey density for the three major prey species of the hen harriers\nwas estimated in each year. Red grouse chick density was\nestimated by transect sampling using pointing dogs with brood\nsize and nest density estimated based on counts in June and July.\nMeadow pipits were counted by visual observation using line\ntransect surveys. An index of field vole abundance was obtained\nfrom the numbers of voles caught per 100 snap-trap nights.\nAnalysis\nTo provide a baseline for evaluating the implications of an\nMSFR, we first fitted a generalised single species functional\nresponse [13] to our data (equation (3)). Consumption of grouse by\nharriers is treated as a function of grouse density alone, and the\npresence of other prey in the system is ignored. F is the number of\ngrouse chicks brought to a harrier nest per hour by individual\nparents, N is the density of grouse chicks in the area based on\ngrouse nest counts and brood sizes.\nEq. (3) was fitted to the data using computer-intensive Bayesian\nmethods (Monte Carlo Markov Chain \u2013MCMC). We adopted this\napproach for three reasons. First, it allowed us to use a plausible\nsampling distribution for our response data, avoiding the need to\nassume normality or use transformations. Because the data were\ncounts of predation events over fixed units of time and space,\nconsumption was initially modelled by a Poisson sampling\ndistribution around the fitted function. However, as is often the\ncase with data of this kind [14], the residuals of the Poisson model\nwere overdispersed. We therefore used a negative binomial\nsampling distribution, which includes an additional parameter\nfor the degree of over-dispersion in the data [36]. Second, the\nBayesian approach enabled us to incorporate independent\ninformation about the values for t, a and m in the form of prior\ndistributions (more details of these distributions are given below).\nThird, the joint posterior distribution of the parameters could be\ndirectly approximated from the MCMC draws. This flexible\napproach to uncertainty has several advantages [37]. For example,\nwe avoided the need for the kind of 2-stage fitting process that has\npreviously been used to decide whether a functional response\nshould be considered sigmoidal [38], because we represent\nuncertainty about the form of the functional response explicitly\nby the posterior distribution of the parameter m.\nWe then fitted a multispecies extension of eq. (4) in which\nconsumption of any one prey type is a function of the availability\nof all types of prey. As in the single-species case, we assumed no\nobservation error in the Nj and individual negative binomial\nsampling distributions for the consumption rates Fj. The\ncorrelation structure of the Fj follows from eq. (2).\nThe MSFR is a non-linear function that employs as many\nresponse variables (the consumption of each prey species) as\nexplanatory variables (the availability of each prey species). Not\nonly does this impose apparently severe demands for data on prey\navailability and consumption, but there are few standard statistical\ntechniques for fitting this kind of relationship. Those that are\navailable cannot satisfactorily account for parameter and model\nuncertainty. However, Bayesian, computer-intensive methods\nplace few restrictions on model structure, allowing us to apply a\nnegative binomial sampling distribution to estimate the over-\ndispersion in the data and thus quantify parameter uncertainty\nrigorously and comprehensively for the multi-species case.\nWe used additional data and biological first principles to\nprovide prior distributions for model parameters in both the\nsingle- and multi-species FR. For the ti we used a gamma prior\nwith prey-specific mean and variance derived from published data.\nIn our formulation of the FR, the attack rate on prey species i is\ngiven by aiNi\nmi{1. We used observational data on the attack rate\nfor grouse [29] to derive a joint prior for agrouse and mgrouse. Negative\nvalues of m are meaningless, and values of m between 0 and 1\nimply that at unchanged abundance of other prey species, attack\nrate on one prey species can decrease with increasing density of\nthis prey, which is implausible. We therefore chose a shifted\ngamma prior for m with minimum 1. The prior mean and variance\nof all mi were set to 2 and 0.9 respectively, giving a 95th percentile\nof 3.9. No prior knowledge was available for apipit and avole, so\nvarious relatively uninformative priors were used to check for\nrobustness in the choice of prior. Results are shown for a gamma\nprior with mean 1 and variance 0.99.\nMCMC was implemented with a Random Walk Metropolis-\nHastings algorithm [39]. Variances of the proposal distributions\nwere adjusted to achieve acceptance rates between 15\u201330% for\neach parameter. Plots of cumulative parameter means indicated\nthat 4,000,000 iterations were satisfactory for convergence. We\npreceded these with a burn-in phase of 10,000 draws that did not\ncontribute to the posterior. The validity of assuming a negative\nbinomial sampling distribution for the consumption data was\nchecked by comparing cumulative left probabilities for each\ndatum, computed from its corresponding predictive distribution,\nwith the negative binomial distribution (QQ plot).\nResults\nPosterior point and interval parameter estimates for both the\nsingle- and multi-species FRs are shown in Table 1. For the single\nspecies FR (harriers preying on grouse only) the estimate of m was\n1.09, implying a weakly sigmoidal FR. This is in contrast to the\nresults of earlier work [32] which used non-linear least squares\nmethod and found support for a strongly sigmoidal FR. The\ndifference is mainly due to our use of a less restrictive sampling\ndistribution for the consumption data [40]. Also, the broad\nmarginal posterior distribution of the parameter tgrouse implies that\nthe data do not support a well-defined asymptotic consumption\nrate for the single species FR. The mean estimate of tgrouse implies\nan asymptotic consumption rate of approximately 3 items per hour\nfor grouse chicks. However, it should be noted that this\nconsumption rate is not predicted within the range of our\nobserved prey densities: it is, in effect, an extrapolation and would\nonly occur at levels of grouse density that are unrealistically high.\nThere was no overlap between the posterior credible intervals\nfor tgrouse and mgrouse obtained from the single-species FR and the\nMSFR (see Table 1). The mean estimates of tgrouse, tpipit and tvole\nrespectively imply maximum consumption rates of 0.365, 0.597\nand 0.431. Note that the handling time estimated for grouse under\nthis model is much higher than that estimated under the single-\nspecies model, and consequently, the predicted maximum\nconsumption rate for harriers feeding solely on grouse is lower\n(and probably more realistic). We also note that the handling times\nfor the three prey species under the multi-species model are fairly\nsimilar to one another. This seems reasonable, given that any prey\nitem must be carried back to the nest by the parent birds to be fed\nto the chicks no matter what its size.\nFunctional Response\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 May 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 5 | e10761\nThe multi-species model has estimates of m.1 for all prey\nspecies, and the values of m also vary between prey species. This is\nevidence that prey preferences are variable i.e. that switching\nwould be expected in this system. Because of this, and also because\nour prey abundances are expressed as indices rather than absolute\nvalues, we do not attempt to interpret the estimates of a directly in\nterms of prey preference. Instead, we use the Bayesian framework\nto illustrate the emergent properties of our functional response and\nits implications for grouse. The grouse component of the MSFR\nand its implications for harrier-induced grouse mortality at a range\nof alternative prey densities are shown in Fig. 1, where an index of\nmortality rate is calculated simply from F\/N (i.e. the gradient of\nthe functional response curve). Although mgrouse&1 for the MSFR,\nimplying a sigmoidal response to this prey species, the conse-\nquences of this are only obvious at low densities of voles and pipits\n(Fig. 1a), when there is a sharp peak in harrier-induced grouse\nmortality at low grouse density (Fig. 1d). At higher densities of\nvoles or pipits, the maximum grouse mortality caused by a pair of\nharriers is around half of its corresponding value when alternative\nprey are rare.\nDiscussion\nThe impact of a predator on prey population dynamics will\ndepend not only on the MSFR, but also on the predator\u2019s\nnumerical response to changes in the density of all prey species\n[17], [41]. Other mechanisms, such as prey behaviour, may also\ncontribute to the underlying dynamics of the prey population [42].\nThe possible implications of the MSFR for prey dynamics in a\nsimple system can be investigated graphically [43]. To illustrate\nthis, we plotted per capita grouse recruitment (in the absence of\npredators), and per capita harrier-induced grouse mortality,\nagainst grouse density (Fig. 2a). At grouse densities where these\ncurves intersect, removals due to predation are exactly compen-\nsated by the production of new individuals through reproduction \u2013\nwe then expect the prey population to remain constant and these\npoints are referred to as equilibrium grouse densities. The curves\nindicate these, provided that densities of the predator and other\nprey (voles and pipits) remain constant. \u2018Stable equilibrium\u2019 occurs\nif predation pressure increases above, and decreases below. This\nwill tend to stabilise the prey population towards the equilibrium\npoint if transient external influences lead to short-term population\ngrowth or shrinkage. \u2018Unstable equilibrium\u2019 is expected if\npredation pressure decreases above, and increases below the\nequilibrium point. In this case, small departures from equilibrium\n(e.g. due to environmental fluctuations) would be expected to\nproduce dramatic declines or growth in the prey population.\nFor this illustration, we assumed that grouse density, in the\nabsence of predation, is determined by a simple logistic model.\nThe figure is characterised by one unstable equilibrium (labelled B\nin Fig. 2a) and two stable equilibria (labelled A and C in Fig. 2a).\nEquilibrium A is sometimes referred to as a \u2018predator pit\u2019. In our\nsystem it only occurs at low densities of alternative prey. If the\ndensity of alternative prey is increased, only the high grouse\ndensity equilibrium (C) appears to be possible. However, the\nuncertainty associated with the estimates of the MSFR implies that\nthere is a family of possible harrier-induced mortality curves\nassociated with each alternative prey density (Fig 2b). Some\nmembers of this family give rise to three equilibria and some to\nonly one. By resampling from the posterior distributions for the\nparameters of the MSFR, we found that there is 0.56 probability\nthat a predator pit exists when the density of alternative prey is\nlow, but this probability is reduced to 0.06 at intermediate\ndensities of alternative prey and to 0.04 at high densities. This\nimplies, for example, that active habitat management may almost\neliminate the existence of the predator pit equilibrium and thereby\ncontribute to more stable high-density grouse populations.\nThe true nature of the interaction between grouse, hen harriers\nand alternative prey is likely to be more complex than this.\nImportantly, while we have assumed that harrier density remains\nconstant, it is known that hen harriers show a multi-species\naggregative response (i.e. a numerical response) to all three prey\n[32], [29]. It is known that the effect of predator numerical and\nfunctional responses acting together is important in some systems\n[44] and this should also be considered in the multi-species context\nwhen populations of generalist predators are able to exploit a\nvariety of prey [44]. In the hen-harrier grouse system, the effect of\nthe multi-species aggregative response is to increase the number of\nharriers when alternative prey is present at intermediate or high\ndensities, and the multi-species functional response then predicts\nan increase in predation mortality on grouse chicks. The main\nconsequence is that, for intermediate-to-high levels of voles\/pipits,\nthe system is likely to have only one stable grouse equilibrium,\nwhich \u2013 depending on harrier density \u2013 may be close to, or below\nthe level observed in the absence of predators. This can be seen as\nan example of apparent competition, because here the presence of\nanother prey species depresses population levels of grouse due to\nan indirect effect mediated by a predator. Similar effects have been\nobserved in other mammal populations [45].\nA full exploration of the consequences of combined numerical\nand functional responses for the grouse hen-harrier system is\nbeyond the scope of this paper and requires considerable further\nanalysis that would need to take into account, for example, the\nrather complex nature of grouse population dynamics [42]. There\nis good empirical and theoretical evidence that density-dependent\npopulation regulation in grouse gives rise to intrinsic population\ncycles in the absence of predation [46]. The parameterisation of an\nMSFR that takes account of all important predator prey\ninteractions is a key step towards modelling multi-species\npopulation dynamics, improving our understanding of mecha-\nTable 1.

This may be done by\n\u2018fixing\u2019 MSFR parameters within the dynamical model, thus\nreducing the number of parameters that must be estimated from\ntime series of population counts [42], [41]. Alternatively, if the\nentire population model is to be fitted to time-series data using\nBayesian methods, a previously fitted MSFR can be used to\nprovide informative priors for its parameters [37].\nOur results show that using a single-species FR to model the\nbehaviour of a generalist predator could result in misleading\nconclusions about the potential effects of that predator on its prey.\nThe fitted form of the single-species FR depends critically on the\ndensities of alternative prey on each occasion that the density and\nconsumption of the focal prey species were measured, and on the\nassumptions that are made about error distribution. However, the\ndensities of alternative prey weight the generalist predator\u2019s\nestimated single-species FR in unpredictable and potentially\nhighly variable ways. These problems can be overcome by fitting\nan MSFR, but it is important to have consumption data from a\ndiverse range of prey densities to avoid the need for extrapolation.\nWhere an MSFR is of interest for an ecological study, field data\nare more appropriate than those collected in a laboratory situation\nbecause of the difficulties involved in realistically replicating prey\navailability in the laboratory [47]. Multispecies feeding data are\nusually analysed for evidence of switching between alternative prey\n[48], but the results of such analyses are hard to interpret\nquantitatively. Fitting an MSFR requires no more data than an\nanalysis of switching or of frequency-dependent selection, but it\nprovides quantitative information on the predator\u2019s behaviour that\ncan be used to predict its consumption over the entire range of\nobserved prey densities. Depending on the nature of available\ndata, it may be possible to use readily available software such as\nWinBUGS [49] to fit a multi-species functional response [50].\nMany different functional response models have been proposed\nfor both single and multi-species systems, and some of these\ninvolve biological effects that we have not included in our\nformulation [28]. For example, competition between predators\ncan be captured by using a measure of the ratio of prey to\npredators, rather than some absolute measure of prey abundance\n[51]. Such models have been found appropriate, for example, for\nmammalian predators in a terrestrial system [52]. However there\nis evidence to suggest that ratio dependence may not be important\nin the hen-harrier grouse system [32], and we consider that our\nformulation for the MSFR is a reasonable choice for our study: it\ncan reproduce all of the standard forms (Type 1, 2 and 3) for a\nsingle species FR and does not generate any of the anomalous\ndynamics shown by some other formulations [28]. It should be\nFigure 1. Estimated consumption rate and mortality rate for grouse chicks, as a function of grouse density.

An\nunderstanding of their MSFR, and the uncertainties associated\nwith these responses, is essential for the sound management of\npests or endangered species. It is now clear that this can be\nachieved with a relatively sparse data sets (eg [50]). The MSFR\nalso provides a much-needed link between models of individual\npredator-prey interactions and ecosystem models.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Tim Coulson, Charles Godfray, Jeremy Greenwood, Bryan\nGrenfell and 2 anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on the\nmanuscript.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: SR ST.
