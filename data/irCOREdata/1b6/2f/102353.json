INTRODUCTION \nDue to the enormous success and popularity of the \nInternet, IP is rapidly emerging as the lingua franca of all \nfuture networking with -the next generation of mobile \ncommunication systems set to evolve to bccome IP-based as \nwell. The emergence of 1P-based network for mobile \ncommunications will enable the convergence of, and the \naccess to voice, video, messaging, data and web-based \ntechnologies for the wireless user in a seamless manner, in \nmuch the same way the fixed users are currently experiencing \nover the Internet. The provision of these IP-based multimedia \nservices is made possible through the introduction of the IP \nMultimedia Subsystem (IMS) as part of the 3GPP Release 5 \nset of standards in Universal Mobile Telecommunication \nSystems (UMTS). Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [I] ,  a \nprotocol developed within the Internet Engineering Task Force \n(IETF), has been selected by the 3GPP as the end-to-end 1P \nsignalling protocol for establishing multimedia sessions. \nAt the same time, a satellite component has been identified \nin UMTS, where in contrast to the 2\"d generation mobile \nglobal satellite systems which were conceived as stand-alone \nsystems, each with its own proprietary protocol, the third \ngeneration offers the unique opportunity of a fully integrated \nand standardized satellite segment with open interfaces \nincluding the air interface. In addition to its fast service \ndeployment and coverage extension capability, satellite- \nUMTS (S-UMTS), as  a direct consequence of its broadcast \nnature and ubiquitous coverage, offers a natural way to \nprovide multicast and broadcast services in a more cost- \nefficient manner than its terrestrial counterpart. To achieve \nhigh degree of commonality with the IP-based T-UMTS \nnetwork, there is therefore a need to support SIP-based session \nestablishment over the satellite component as well. Integration \nand co-operation of S-UMTS with the terrestrial system is \nnecessary as this will not only enable a seamless service \nprovision, but it also permits the re-use of the terrestrial \ninfrastructure as well as the use of highly integrated multi- \nmode terrestriallsatellite terminals. All these result in reduced \ntechnology complexity and overall system cost. \nNevertheless, the transport of SIP over the radio interface \nis not efficient due to the inherent characteristics of SIP being \ntransactional-based and generous in size. This is made worse \nwhen transversing an error-prone wireless link with a larger \nsatellite propagation delay. One of the techniques to reduce \nthe session setup delay is by compression of the signalling \nmessages, such as the text-based message compression \ntechnique proposed in [2]. Our approach to improve the \nsession setup performance is by incorporating a link layer \nretransmission based on the Radio Link Control \nacknowledgement mode (RLC-AM) [3] mechanisms as a \nmethod to conceal link-related losses from the upper layers. \nIn [4], we have shown that by adding unsolicited STATUS \nreport trigger on top of solicited feedback, the session setup \ndelay and blocking probability are reduced due to the \nincreased responsiveness of the RLC error recovery process. \nHowever, this configuration of having more than one trigger \nfor the transmission of the STATUS report is found to cause \nunnecessary retransmissions when applied over the satellite. \nThis redundancy is undesirable since it lowers the protocol \nefficiency. In view of this, an enhancement to the RLC \nprotocol based on a timer retransmission scheme is proposed \nin this paper to overcome this inefficiency. \nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 11, the \ninefficiency of the current UMTS RLC-AM procedure when \napplied over the satellite is highlighted, of which a scheme \nproposed to alleviate this will be presented. Section 111 \ndescribes the simulation environment and assumptions, and \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on April 12,2010 at 08:19:23 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

ENHANCEMENT TO RLC-AM FOR SATELLITE-UMTS \nThe RLC-AM retransmission method as defined in UMTS \nis based on a hybrid sliding window ARQ protocol with \nselective acknowledgments (SACK) and negative \nacknowledgments (NAK). Higher layer data packets, known \nas RLC Service Data Units (SDUs) are segmented into fixed \nlength RLC Packet Data Units (PDUs). Feedback in the form \nof a STATUS report is sent to indicate to the sender which \nPDUs have been successfully received and which have not. \nBased on the STATUS report received, the sender retransmits \nthose negatively acknowledged PDUs. With many features \nprovided, RLC-AM is extremely flexible and can be \nconfigured in several ways. \nHowever a problem has been identified with the use of the \ncurrent UMTS RLC-AM procedure over the satellite \nenvironment. It has been found that when more than one \nSTATUS report trigger is configured for transactional \napplications such as session establishment, as in the case of \nhaving both the unsolicited and solicited STATUS report \ntrigger options set, redundant retransmission is more likely to \noccur. This happens when the sender retransmits a PDU more \nthan once in response to the received STATUS report although \nearlier retransmission has already taken place. This is because \ndue to the long round trip time over the satellite, the first \nretransmission of the PDU may still be in-flight and thus has \nnot reached the receiver. As a result, the next generated \nSTATUS report is not up-to-date and the already retransmitted \nPDU is still indicated as missing. An example of this is \nexplicitly illustrated in Fig. I .  \nAMD PDU \nStatus PDU ................ . \nFig. I .  Example of the occurrence of redundant retransmission due to outdated \nfeedback \nIn the example shown, the PDU with SN=3 is missing. \nWhen the subsequent PDU, i.e. the PDU with SN=4, reaches \nthe receiver successfully, a STATUS report is generated to \nreport back to the sender that the PDU with SN=3 is missing, \nsince the \u2018Missing PDU Indicator\u2019 has been configured [3]. \nThe sender then retransmits the PDU with SN=3 upon \nreceiving the unsolicited STATUS report. While this \nretransmitted PDU is still in-flight, another STATUS report is \ntriggered, where this time it is transmitter-driven due to poll \nbit set in the PDU with SN=6 (the last PDU of the SDU). \nSince the PDU with SN=3 has yet arrived at the receiver (due \nto the high satellite round trip time), this PDU is again \nreported as missing. Another retransmission of this PDU will \nultimately cause redundant retransmission when both of the \nretransmissions of the same PDU are successfully received \nlater. \nThis redundant retransmission is undesirable as it is \nrendered useless and ignored by the receiver. Since there is no \ntrue information transfer, extra retransmission only leads to a \nwaste in the channel bandwidth. Secondly, since \nretransmissions of PDUs have a higher priority than new \nPDUs, this will only block the transfer of new PDUs. \nFurthermore, redundant retransmission consumes battery \npower needlessly which is not energy efficient and with \nmobile terminal powered by a finite battery source, it is \ntherefore pivotal to conserve this limited energy resource. \nMoreover, these extra retransmissions unnecessarily increase \nthe interference to other users and in an interference-limited \nsystem, as in a CDMA environment, this is detrimental as it \nmay globally deteriorate the quality of service. \nHence a scheme, which we named.\u2018RLC-AM Timer-based \nRetransmission\u2019, is proposed. This approach associates each \nPDU with the time when it was last (re)transmitted, i.e. every \ntime a PDU is transmitted or retransmitted, the time at that \nmoment is taken. Every time retransmission of a PDU is \ntriggered, be it due to the reception of a STATUS report \n(solicited or unsolicited) or the expiry of the poll timer (when \nthere is no new PDU for transmission), a comparison is made \nbetween the time of the last (re)transmission of that PDU with \nthe current time. If the difference is more than the round trip \ntime of the RLC PDU, another retransmission of this PDU is \nallowed to take place, otherwise the retransmission is \nsuppressed. Thus it can he seen that the implementation of this \nscheme requires a variable associated with each PDU, which \nsaves the time it is last (re)transmitted. Since this scheme \nrequires only minor additions locally (without affecting the \noperation of its peer entity if this scheme is not supported \ntherein), it is fully backward compatible with the existing \nimplementation of UMTS RLC-AM. \n111. SIMULATION MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS \nTo compare the performance of the proposed scheme, \nRLC-AM Timer-based Retransmission with the standard RLC \nprocedure as specified in [3], herein referred to as UMTS \nRLC-AM (Baseline), a system level simulator developed in \nOPNET\u2019 similar to that described in [4] was used.

Restrictions apply. \nschemes were assessed for an end-to-end mobile originated \nSIP-based voice over IP (VolP) session establishment to a \nfixcd user over the Internet through the UMTS Satellite Radio \nAccess Network (USRAN), the UMTS IP Core Network and \nthe IMS. The reference architecture employed, which is \nconsistent with the UMTS Release 5 IP-based network \narchitecture [SI, is shown in Fig. 2 .  The session establishment \nsignalling sequences followed the ones depicted in, [4] and \nwere modelled according to their protocol behaviour as \ndetailed in their respective specifications with the message \nsizes following the ones listed in [ 6 ] .  It was assumed that the \nuser equipment (UE) was located within the service area of the \nnetwork operator to whom the UE subscribed and that the UE \nhad already setup an RRC connection and activated a primary \nPDP context which was used to carry the IMS related \nsignalling. It was also assumed that the UE had performed \nregistration with both the GPRS network as well as with the \nIMS network. \nThe USRAN consists of a satellite and an S-UMTS \ngateway, whereby in the selected scenario, the satellite is \nconsidered to be a transparent Geostationary Earth Orbit \n(GEO) satellite, while the Node B and Radio Network \nController (RNC) are collocated in the gateway. The round- \ntrip delay over the UMTS 1P Core Network was assumed to be \n150 ms [ 7 ] ,  while the mean one-way Internet delay and its \nstandard deviation are 50 ms and 7 ms, respectively [ 8 ] .  The \nprocessing time per SIP message in each server is 25 ms [ 2 ]  \nwhile the RLC processing time was assumed to be 15 ms for \nboth uplink and downlink communications [9]. It was assumed \nthat there is no loss in the fixed network, while for the air \ninterface, an erroneous link with parameterized block error \nrate (BLER) was considered, whereby the errors were \nassumed to he uniformly distributed (uncorrelated). For the \nRLC setting, segmentation and in-sequence delivery options \nwere enabled, and only the \u2018last PDU in transmission buffer\u2019, \n\u2018last PDU in retransmission buffer\u2019 and \u2018timer based\u2019 polling \ntriggers were considered in the simulation. The \u2018SDU discard \nafter MaxDAT number of transmissions\u2018 was chosen for the \nSDU discard function, while for the STATUS report, both the \nunsolicited and solicited STATUS report transfers were \nenabled. The rest of the parameters used in the simulations are \nsummarized in Table 1. Note that the values used for these \nparameters are either those recommended or typical values as \nlisted in the respective specifications. \nMax. Tx. of \nActivate Sec.

SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nFig. 3 compares the extra retransmissions performance of \nthe proposed scheme with the standard RLC-AM scheme for \ndifferent BLERs. As expected, the proposed scheme exhibits a \nlower number of redundant retransmission than the UMTS \nRLC-AM (Baseline) procedure, of which the difference \nbetween the two increases with the BLER. These redundant \nretransmissions due to the receipt of out-of-date STATUS \nreport can cause the PDU to reach its MaxDAT value \nunnecessarily. As a result, the UMTS RLC-AM (Baseline) \nprocedure has a much higher SDU discard rate compared to \nthe RLC-AM Timer-based Retransmission scheme, as \nillustrated in Fig. 4. The higher the SDU discard rate, the more \nthe RLC needs to rely on retransmissions from the upper \nlayers for error recovery. With more retransmissions triggered \nat the upper layers, the session establishment will eventually \nfail when the maximum attempt of any of the upper layer \nprotocols is reached. As a result, it can be seen from Fig. 5 \nthat the UMTS RLC-AM (Baseline) procedure has a higher \ncall blocking probability than the proposed method. \n0-7803-8255-2\/o4p$20.00 02004 IEEE. 2789 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Session setup delay comparison between timer-based Relx with UMTS \nRLC scheme far different BLERs \nFig. 6 shows that an improved session establishment delay \nis obtained with the timer-based retransmission scheme. Due \nto the higher SDU discard rate, the UMTS RLC-AM \n(Baseline) scheme needs to rely on the upper layers to ensure \nreliability, whereby the end-to-end error recovery process is \ngenerally slower compared to local retransmissions performed \nat the link layer. It is noted that the improvement of the RLC- \nAM Timer-based Retransmission scheme over the UMTS \nRLC-AM (Baseline) is more obvious at moderate BLER. This \nis because at low BLER, there are not so many AMD or \ncontrol PDUs that are lost, while at high BLER, both schemes \nsuffer from high PDU lost. Hence the advantage of the \nproposed scheme at these two extreme values of BLER is not \nas apparent. \nV. CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper, we have proposed a timer-based \nretransmission scheme, which allows a PDU retransmission to \ntake place only when the difference between the time of the \nlast (re)transmission ofthat PDU with the current time is more \nthan the RLC PDU round trip time. This scheme is able to \nreduce the number of redundant retransmissions which occur \ndue to the unnecessary triggering of retransmission when the \nreceived STATUS report is not up-to-date. This condition \nhappens when more than one STATUS report trigger is \nenabled, as in the case when both the unsolicited and solicited \nfeedbacks are configured, as well as when the round trip time \nof the RLC PDU is high, as in transversing a GEO satellite. \nWith a lower SDU discard rate attained with this scheme, the \nsession establishment failure and delay performances are \neventually improved. Therefore, this scheme not only \nincreases the protocol eficiency but also the system capacity \ncan be improved as lower interference is acquired through this \nduplicate retransmission avoidance scheme. \nREFERENCES \n[ I ]  J.
