Most of the work to date has \nconcentrated on relatively low velocity impact studies [2-7] where the size and shape of \nthe panel determine its energy absorbing capability. This is different to high velocity \nprojectiles which induce a localised response in the target and consequently does not \ndepend on the areal size of the target [8]. Most high velocity work with CFRPs to date \nhas been done using single specimens of relatively thin laminates [9-14]. Some work has \nalso been done on hybrid composites where fibre properties, sequencing and interfacial \nstrengths have been varied [15,16]. However, little high velocity impact work has been \ndone on relatively thick carbon fibre structures where the thickness of laminate was > 8 \nmm or on structures where two laminates were bonded together.  \n \nBonded E-glass composite plates have however, been studied by Liu et al. [17]. In this \nwork they studied the low velocity impact response of a variety of joining techniques \nwith multiple layers of cross-ply laminates in an effort to understand the feasibility of \nreplacing single thick laminates with multiple bonded thin laminates in structures. They \nconcluded that pure epoxy bonding was found to be the most efficient joining technique \nin assembling composite laminates together since it gave the highest bending stiffness \nand perforation threshold. Furthermore, they showed that assembled composite plates \nwere found to have perforation thresholds similar to the laminated counterpart. \nConsequently, they concluded that assembled composites could be used to replace the \nsingle laminates, as far as the perforation threshold was concerned. \n \nRelatively few studies have also been done on the oblique penetration of CFRP \nlaminates. Most impacts from high velocity projectiles will occur with some degree of \nobliquity and consequently, it is important to understand the effect that obliquity has on a \npenetrating projectile. Lamontagne et al. [18,19] have studied the penetration of  CFRP \nlaminates at oblique angles, however this was done at very high velocities that far \nexceeded the velocities of projectiles of interest in this study. More recently Lopez-\nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 3\nPuente et al. [14] have presented work on the normal and oblique penetration of CFRP \nlaminates using both a gas gun and the finite element commercial code \nABAQUS\/Explicit. They showed that the maximum damage inflicted by the projectile at \nthe ballistic limit was produced at normal incidence. Furthermore, below the ballistic \nlimit, the extent of damage for normal impact was larger than that for the oblique impact. \nHowever, the extent of damage at higher velocities appeared to be greater for oblique \nimpacts. Further oblique work has been presented in [1] where it was shown that for \ntargets that were impacted at an oblique angle more of the kinetic energy was transferred \nfrom the projectile to the target material when compared to the same thickness of target \nthat was subjected to a normal incidence impact. The authors also showed that this was \nmerely due to a geometrical effect. Thicker panels appeared to behave more efficiently by \nabsorbing more kinetic energy per effective-linear-thickness at the lower impact energies \nwhere petalling was a dominant factor in the penetration. This advantage seemed to \nvanish as the impact energy was increased. \n \nIn this study, the impact response of a two-part bonded woven CFRP where two 6-mm \nthick CFRP laminates were assembled using an epoxy adhesive was examined. The \ntargets were subjected to impact and penetration by a fully-annealed stainless steel sphere \nwithin the velocity range of 187 m\/s to 1219 m\/s. This is the range of velocities that could \nbe expected from small-arms bullets and fragments from exploding munitions. This \ncorresponded to a kinetic energy range of between 126 J and 5324 J. Targets were placed \nat normal incidence to the axis of projectile flight and angled at 45\u00b0.  \n \n2.0 EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY \n \n2.1 Materials Used \n \nThe materials chosen for this study were woven CFRP laminates that were manufactured \nusing the resin transfer method (RTM). These laminates were chosen because they are \ncommonly used in the aerospace industry.  All individual panels were manufactured with \nHexcel G0926 Carbon Fabric with a 5 harness satin weave. The resin used was Hexcel \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 4\nRTM 6 cured for 1 hour 40 minutes at 180 \u00b0C and at a pressure of 100 psi. The dynamic \nbehaviour of the cured resin has previously been studied in [20-22]; the shock response of \nthe laminate has been studied by Millett et al. [23] and Hazell et al. [24].The CFRP panel \nused in the two-part construction was 6 mm thick and made from 16 plies with the lay-up \nsequence from impact face: (0\/90, \u00b1 45, \u00b1 45, 0\/90, \u00b1 45, \u00b1 45, 0\/90, 0\/90, \u00b145, 0\/90, \u00b1 \n45, 0\/90, \u00b145, 0\/90, \u00b1 45, 0\/90). The targets were constructed by bonding two 300 mm \u00d7 \n300 mm panels of  6-mm thickness together using a two part epoxy adhesive (Hysol\u00ae \n0151) under a uniformly distributed load of 2000 kgF at room temperature for 24 hours to \nprovide a relatively thick structure (c.a. 12 mm) of symmetrical lay-up. The measured \nthickness of the adhesive layer ranged between 70 \u00b5m and 120 \u00b5m. The density of the \nCFRP material, measured using a Micrometrics AccuPyc 1330 gas pycnometer, was \n1.512 g\/cc \u00b1 0.001 g\/cc. The mass fraction of the reinforcement was measured using the \nacid digestion method according to ASTM D 3171-6, Procedure B [25] and was found to \nbe 69.7\u00b11.0%. \n \n2.2 Impact testing \n \nThe projectile used was a fully annealed stainless steel sphere (\u220511.97 mm \u00b1 0.01 mm; \nmass = 7.165 g \u00b1 0.001 g; VHN = 127). The balls (AISI 304) were fully annealed in air at \n1050\u00b0C to provide equiaxed austenite grains and consequently isotropic behavior. The \nyield strength of this steel at 21\u00b0C is 450 MPa with an ultimate tensile strength of 675 \nMPa [26]. The projectile was fired from ELVIS, a single stage \u220522-mm gas-gun for \nvelocities of less than 400 m\/s. To achieve the higher velocities a 30-mm single stage gas \ngun and a \u220530-mm RARDEN cannon were employed. With the \u220530-mm gas gun, a \nbaffle plate was employed behind the sabot stripper to remove any sabot debris that \ninadvertently made its way through the sabot stripper behind the projectile. Target \nspecimens were cut from the bonded panels into 150 mm \u00d7 150 mm squares and secured \nat the top and bottom in a target\u2013holding rig. \n \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 5\nImpact, rebound, ricochet and exit velocities were measured by high-speed video camera \n(Phantom 7; 18,000 and 21,000 frames-per-second; 2 \u00b5s exposure time) to an accuracy of \n< 1%. The energy transferred to the panel (Et) was calculated from  \n \n( )22\n2\n1\nript vvmE \u2212=        (1) \n \nwhere mp is the mass of the projectile, and vi and vr are the impact and residual velocities. \n \nConsequently, the percentage change in kinetic energy (\u0394Ef) was calculated using \n \n100\u00d7=\u0394\ni\nt\nf E\nEE        (2) \n \nwhere Ei is the kinetic energy of the projectile prior to impact. \n \nParallax was taken into account by knowing the distances from the lens to the axis of \npenetration and from the axis of penetration to fiduciary markers.  \n \nThe extent of damage in the perforated composites was assessed by doing C-scans using \na glass reflector technique with a 5MHz, 50mm crystal focus transducer.

For \nseveral low-energy cases, the projectile did not perforate the composite. Where the target \nwas orientated at normal incidence to the trajectory of the projectile, impacting the \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 6\nlaminate target with an energy of 129 J (190 m\/s) resulted in the projectile rebounding \nfrom the target with a relatively low velocity of 34 m\/s. Increasing the impact energy \nresulted in the projectile rebounding at a lower velocity until the impact energy of 353 J \n(314 m\/s) where the projectile was completely embedded in the back plate of the CFRP \n(see Figure 2). In this case, petalling was evident on the rear surface of the back plate. \nEventually, perforation occurred with an impact energy of 429 J (346 m\/s). This result \nimplied a ballistic limit velocity in the range of 314 m\/s \u2013 346 m\/s for the normal incident \ncases.  \n \nFigure 1: The effect of impact energy on the percentage change in kinetic energy of the projectile. \n \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 7\n \nFigure 2: Front and rear surfaces (left and right respectively) of the second CFRP laminate plate \nafter completely penetrating the front plate with an impact energy of 353 J (314 m\/s). \n \nAfter the perforation threshold was reached, increasing the impact energy led to a \nreduction in the percentage of kinetic energy transferred to the panel. This is in keeping \nwith previous work [15,27] and corresponds to a reduction in the delamination of the \nstructure (discussed later). \n \nThere is one further observation to note. Previous work [27] had shown that when a 6-\nmm thick composite of a similar lay-up to the panels tested here were subjected to \nimpacts at velocities of up to 1875 m\/s, an asymptotic level of kinetic energy absorption \nwas achieved. For the normal incidence tests, we were able to achieve an impact velocity \nof 1219 m\/s, corresponding to an impact energy of 5324 J (not shown in Figure 1). This \ntest resulted in 36 % of the incident projectile energy being absorbed by the two-part \nbonded panel confirming that the percentage of kinetic energy absorbed was indeed \napproaching an asymptotic level. \n \nFor the oblique incident targets, increasing the impact energy from 126 J (188 m\/s) \nresulted in an increase in the percentage of kinetic energy absorbed. In each case, the \nprojectile ricocheted until the projectile became fully embedded in the target at 484 J (see \nFigure 3 (d)). Increasing the impact energy from 126 J to 239 J resulted in a relatively \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 8\nrapid increase in the percentage of kinetic energy absorbed by the target when compared \nwith further increases in impact energy. Figure 3(a) shows the effect on the target when \nthe projectile strikes at 126 J. Very little material was removed from the target. \nConsequently, this resulted in a relatively high ricochet velocity. Increasing the impact \nenergy from 126 J to 239 J (Figure 3(b)) resulted in more material being removed from \nthe target with the penetration cavity increasing in length from 17.5 mm at 126 J impact \nto 23.3 mm at 239 J; the maximum depth penetrated increased from 1.7 mm at 126 J to \n3.0 mm at 239 J. The ricochet velocity was reduced from 91 m\/s to 71 m\/s despite a \nhigher impact velocity and this is consistent with the increase in amount of material \nexcavated from the CFRP. Increasing the impact energy further to 365 J (319 m\/s) \nresulted in a ricochet velocity of 60 m\/s and a cavity length of 32.6 mm. The measured \nmaximum depth-of-penetration in this case was 5.3 mm (see Figure 3c). Eventually, at an \nimpact energy of 484 J (367 m\/s), the projectile became fully embedded in the front plate \n(see Figure 3d). Only at this impact energy was the front plate completely penetrated. \nThis was combined with visible failure of tows on the back face of the rear plate. \n \nFigure 3: Penetration cavity formed after impacting the target with (a) 126 J (187 m\/s), (b) 239 J (259 \nm\/s), (c) 365 J (319 m\/s), (d) 484 J (367 m\/s). \n \nThere are two further things to note with the oblique targets. Firstly, the percentage of \nkinetic energy transferred to the oblique targets was consistently lower than that of the \nnormal incident targets until perforation occurred at 429 J (346 m\/s). This suggested that \ngreater penetration and damage occurred in the normal incident targets when compared to \nthe oblique targets until perforation. A comparison of the measured depth-of-penetration \nfrom recovered specimens that were subjected to similar impact velocities of 264 m\/s and \n258 m\/s at normal and oblique angles respectively revealed that the normal incidence \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 9\nimpact specimen suffered c.a. 50 % more penetration than the oblique panel.  At an \nimpact energy of 484 J (367 m\/s), the projectile penetrated the CFRP laminate target and \nbecame embedded resulting in 100% energy absorption (see Figure 3(d)). \n \nIncreasing the impact energy of the oblique targets to 615 J resulted in perforation. \nInterestingly, the behavior of the perforated oblique targets mirrored that of the normal-\nincident targets suggesting that similar penetration behavior was occurring. In each case \nhowever, a greater percentage of kinetic energy was absorbed by the oblique panels. This \nis a common feature of oblique targets that are subjected to ballistic impact. As noted in \n[1] for thinner targets (\u2264 6 mm), this was due to the increase in effective linear thickness \nof material offered to the projectile. Figure 4 shows a direct comparison between the \noblique experiments and normal incidence experiments. A linear trend line is fitted \nthrough the normal-incidence data. For the oblique targets the effective linear thickness \noffered to the projectile was calculated from \n \n\u03b8cos\ntteff =            (3) \n \nwhere teff is the effective linear thickness, t is the thickness of the laminate (nominally 12 \nmm) and \u03b8 is the angle between the trajectory of the projectile and the inclination of the \ntarget (nominally 45\u00ba). \n \nAs the impact energy is increased, there is negligible difference in the kinetic energy \nabsorbed by the oblique target when the effective linear thickness is taken into account. \nNoticeably, the trajectory of the projectile did not deviate after it perforated the oblique \ntargets again confirming that obliquity had negligible effect on the penetrating projectile. \nIf the obliquity of the target was affecting the projectile\u2019s penetration path (by causing it \nto deviate during penetration) then the kinetic energy absorbed per effective-linear-\nthickness would be higher than that of the normal-incidence experiments and the \nprojectile would deviate, usually exiting the target in a direction that was perpendicular to \nthe plane of the target e.g., [28,29]. Consequently, over the impact velocity range of \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 10\ninterest, the oblique angle does not have any further effect on the resistance to penetration \nother than offering more material to penetrate. \n \nFigure 4: Comparison between normal and oblique incidence results where perforation had \noccurred. \n \n \n3.2 Energy absorption per-unit-thickness \n \nFigure 5 summarises the energy absorbed per-unit-thickness for targets that were \nperforated by the projectile. Only normal incidence cases are considered here due to a \npaucity of comparative oblique data. Additional data for the 6 mm and 3 mm composite \nmaterials is taken from [1] and [27]. The percentage of kinetic energy per-unit-thickness \nof material absorbed by the 12 mm thick CFRP is higher than the 6 mm and 3 mm \nexamples when impacted at a similar range of energies.  \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 11\n \nFigure 5: Absorbed energy-per-unit-thickness of CFRP where perforation of the target has occurred.  \n \nFor the 3-mm and 6-mm thick composites, it is noted that the energy absorbed per-unit-\nthickness of material is similar whereas the 12-mm thick composites exhibit a slightly \nhigher energy absorbing process. One possibility rationalisation for the observed result is \nthat the distinct bonding layer inbetween the two laminates allows for the formation of a \ncrushed zone of material from the front plate that spreads the load of the projectile over \nthe backing plate. Petalling ensues (as opposed to plug-formation) leading to a larger \namount of delamination in the rear plate. Indeed it was noticed that petalling of the rear \nplate was evident at impact energies of 992 J. Further tentative evidence for the relatively \nhigh ballistic performance of a two-part CFRP has also been shown with a non-woven \nlaminate [30]. In this work, it was shown that the resistance offered by two 5.3-mm non-\nwoven laminates that were bonded together provided a higher energy absorbing ability \nper-unit-thickness than a single 5.3 mm laminate. \n \n \nFigure 6 shows the back-plates of several targets that have been perforated by the \nprojectile. At the lower impact energies, it is clear that petalling occurs prior to \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 12\nperforation. As the impact energy is increased, it is visible that (a) less petalling occurs \nand ; (b) the hole is clearly defined. Well defined  holes are generally synonymous with \nshear-type failure [1] although it was evident that at the highest impact energy (5324 J) \nthe clearly defined hole was due to particulation of the composite during projectile \npenetration [27]. \n \nFigure 6: From petalling to particulation: the effect of the back-plate failure morphology as the \nimpact energy is increased. The impact energies were as follows: (a)  429 J; (b) 498 J; (c) 992 J and; \n(d) 5324 J. \n \n3.3 High-speed video results \n  \n3.3.1. No perforation \n \nThe sequence of events for the penetration of the normal target (353 J) and oblique target \n(365 J) are shown in Figures 7 and 8 respectively. In both cases, the projectile did not \nperforate the target. The time interval between each frame is 110 \u03bcs. \n \nIt is clear from Figure 7 that by 110 \u00b5s, the projectile had penetrated the two-part \ncomposite structure leading to ejecta from the front plate and petalling of the rear plate. \nBy 330 \u00b5s, it was evident that the glue layer, bonding the two samples together, had \nfailed resulting in separation of the plates. Ultimately, by 550 \u00b5s, a small plug of CFRP \nwas ejected from the rear of the plate. \n \nFigure 8 shows the penetration of the steel sphere into an oblique target. By 110 \u00b5s, \nbulging of the rear plate is evident in a direction that is perpendicular to the plane of the \ntarget. This has been previously observed with monolithic laminates of thickness 3 mm \nand 6 mm [1]. This suggests that delamination in the rear panel occurs mostly \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 13\nsymmetrical. However by 220 \u00b5s, the rear panel is seen to recover. By 330 \u00b5s, it appears \nthat a large amount of debris has been ejected from the front plate; by 440 \u00b5s the \nprojectile is seen to ricochet in the general direction of the plane of the target. Although it \nis not obvious in these images, delamination of the rear plate from the front plate \noccurred as observed with the normal incidence target. \n \nFigure 7: Impact of a normal incidence target at 353 J (314 m\/s). \n \nFigure 8: Impact of an oblique incidence target at 365 J (319 m\/s). \n \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 14\nDuring penetration the adhesive line of all the targets except the oblique target that was \nstruck at 126 J (188 m\/s) failed leading to separation of both plates. For the sample \nshown in Figure 7 (Ei = 353 J), interrogation of the high-speed video showed that by 220 \n\u00b5s after impact, the rear plate became separated from the front plate. A small degree of \nbending ensued. \n \nThere are two possibilities as to why the bonding layer failed during penetration. Firstly, \nstress wave reflections at the interface could give rise to tensile instability within the \nadhesive layer. However, this only becomes evident when there is an impedance \nmismatch between samples [31]. The shock impedance for the RTM6 resin used in the \nmanufacture of these composite materials is very similar to common epoxy resins [20] \nand therefore it is very unlikely that this was the cause. It is more likely that the failure is \ndominated by shear-failure processes and the localised movement of the rear plate away \nfrom the front plate due to the petalling process that ensues. Due to the low strain-to-\nfailure of the resin used to bond the samples together (c.a. 2.4% [32]), any localised \nmovement in the rear plate caused by the penetrating projectile would result in failure of \nthe bond layer.  \n \n3.3.2 Perforation \n \nThe sequence of events for the penetration of the normal target (429 J) and oblique target \n(615 J) are shown below in Figures 10 and 11 respectively. Each of these Figures \nrepresents the results for the lowest energy impact to induce perforation of the laminates. \nIn these cases, the time interval between each frame is 55 \u03bcs and 48 \u03bcs for the normal-\nincidence and the oblique-incidence tests respectively. \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 15\n \nFigure 9: Perforation of a 12-mm thick two-part laminate; impact energy = 429 J (346 m\/s). \n \nFigure 10 shows the effect of the sphere penetrating and then perforating the two-part \nlaminate. By 110 \u03bcs, symmetrical deformation of the rear laminate is visible as the \nprojectile penetrates the front laminate finally resulting in tensile failure and break-out by \n165 \u03bcs. Unlike, the 6-mm thick composites impacted with a similar kinetic energy [1], no \nplug was formed; instead the rear of the target failed via petalling with the rear of the \npanel showing a similar failure mode to the sample impacted at 353 J (see Figure 2). The \npetals that were formed were pushed apart by the penetrating projectile and eventually \nrelaxed, partially closing up the penetration cavity. It was evident that relatively few \nfragments were formed as the projectile exited the target. \n \nThe effect of obliquity on the penetration mechanisms is shown in Figure 10. As with the \ntarget that was not perforated, the rear laminate deformed in a direction that was \nperpendicular to the plane of the laminate. When perforated, some debris was propelled \nin that direction whereas the projectile continued along its pre-impact trajectory. \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 16\n \nFigure 10: Perforation of a 12-mm thick two-part oblique laminate ; impact energy = 615 J (414 m\/s). \nHere, the frame rate for the camera has been increased to 21,000 fps. \n \n3.4. Damage assessment \n \nThe targets were C-scanned to examine the extent of the damage to the panels. An image \nanalyzer program was used to measure the damage zone when the signal attenuation was \ngreater than 5 dB. For the targets impacted at a velocity close to the minimum required to \nperforate the target, the cavity had partially closed therefore giving a misleading \nrepresentation of the size of the penetration channel. Consequently, the results presented \nin Figures 12 and 13 include the hole size and represent the total area of damage.  It was \nnoted that in the majority of the normal incidence impact cases the area of delamination \nwas mostly circular for both the front and rear panels. For the oblique samples at the \nlower impact energies, the mostly circular shape implied that symmetric localised \ndeformation had occurred. These observations were different to what was seen with the 3 \nmm and 6 mm thick targets [1] where the impact energy was sufficient to cause \nasymmetric damage at oblique angles. However where the projectile became fully lodged \nin the sample (Ei = 484 J) the C-scan revealed that the delamination was wider at the top \nof the penetration channel (see Figure 3(d)) resulting in a non-circular pattern whereas \nthe rear panel showed a mostly circular pattern. A similar pattern was shown as the \nprojectile perforated the target.  \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 17\n \nFigure 11: Damage area as measured by C-scan for the targets struck at normal incidence. \n \nAlthough we must be cautious in drawing too many conclusions from these results \nbecause these scans provide a two-dimensional view of damage instead of a full three-\ndimensional picture, there are a number of observations to note here. Figure 11 shows the \nseparate C-scans for both the front and back plates for the targets that were subjected to \nnormal incidence impact. For the back plate, the amount of damage increased with \nimpact energy and was greatest (for the impact energy range of interest) at 429 J (346 \nm\/s). At this energy, the projectile just perforated the target. This increase in damage area \nin the back plate was consistent with an increased level of deformation and petal \nformation as the projectile penetrated deeper into the front plate. However, the damage in \nthe front plate changed little over the impact energy range of 129 J \u2013 353 J. When the \ntarget was perforated with an impact energy of 429 J, the level of damage in the front \nplate dropped whereas in the backplate, a high level of damage was recorded consistent \nwith a high level of localised bending and petalling. A drop-off in damage area with \nincreasing impact energy has also been seen in [1] when monolithic composite laminates \nwere subjected to impact and penetration. In this work a drop-off in damage area was \ncharacteristic of a change of penetration mechanism from that of petalling to that of \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 18\nplugging. It should also be noted that when the panel is perforated, although the damage \ndoes decrease with increasing impact energies, the degree of impact energy absorbed \nincreases (see Figures 4-5). This has previously been shown to occur with 6-mm thick \nlaminates [1, 27] and has been shown to be due to energy being used to form larger \ncavities, greater particulation in the penetration zone and the transfer of energy to the KE \nof the resulting fragments [27]. \n \nDespite the fact that compressive \/shear failure had occurred in the front plate of the \nCFRP laminate, the level of damage as measured by C-scan, was considerably higher for \nthe front plate of these two-part laminates than a single 6-mm thick laminate that was \nimpacted at similar velocities. From data in [1], the level of damage for the 6-mm thick \ncomposite in the impact energy range of 200 J to 400 J was c.a. 1500 mm2. Whereas, for \nthe 12-mm bonded samples, the level of observed damage in the front panel was 3700 \nmm2 in a similar impact energy range. Consequently, bonding the second layer of CFRP \nlaminate behind a target laminate not only increases the ballistic performance of the \nsystem but also leads to an increase in the damage to the front plate. Damage to the back \nplate was considerably more extensive too when compared to the single 6-mm thick \nlaminates. Here we saw an increase in the level of damage where petalling was the \ndominant factor. \n \nFor the oblique targets, the damage area is shown in Figure 12. Here the behaviour of the \nfront plate was different to that seen with the normal incidence impacts. The initial \ndashed line used to link the initial two data points for the front plate (from 126 J \u2192 239 \nJ) is assumed and therefore should be treated with a degree of caution. Nevertheless, it is \nclear that there is a relatively steep rise in the front plate damage as the impact energy is \nincreased from 126 J to 239 J. At 126 J (188 m\/s), the delamination in the front plate was \nsmall (c.a. 1380mm2). Increasing the impact energy resulted in an increase in \ndelamination until the projectile penetrated deep into the front plate (at 365 J \/ 484 J). \nThis resulted in less delamination. It should be pointed out however, that at an impact \nenergy of 126 J (188 m\/s), there was insufficient energy to separate the plates during \nimpact. Consequently, this resulted in a much stiffer structure, restricting the amount of \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 19\ndelamination and leading to a much higher ricochet velocity and therefore less energy \nabsorption by the plate (see Figure 1). \n \nPrior to perforation there are a few things to note. With the rear plate the recorded \ndamage increased with the impact energy and was consistently less than the damage \nincurred at normal incidence. This is consistent with the result shown in Figure 1 where \nthe percentage of kinetic energy absorbed by the plate at the oblique angle is less than at \nnormal incidence. That is until perforation occurs. This is also consistent with the work of \nLopez-Puente et al. [14] who showed that with thin (c.a. 2.2 mm) woven laminates, \nbelow the ballistic limit the extent of damage was higher in targets struck at normal \nincidence when compared to those that were struck at oblique incidence. This was due to \nthe projectile being ricocheted from the composite plate instead of rebounding. That is, \nnot all of the kinetic energy is being imparted into the plate but rather the energy is being \ndeflected by the oblique plate resulting in less damage. \n \nAfter perforation, however the level of the damage in both the front plate and the rear \nplate is similar for both the normal-incidence cases and oblique-incidence cases (see \nFigure 13).  Therefore both the level of damage and the KE absorbed per-unit-thickness \nis similar for the normal and incident targets. This raises the prospect that with these \ntypes of materials it is possible to understand the behaviour of an obliquely struck \nlaminate from a single test at normal incidence.  \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 20\n \nFigure 12: Damage area as measured by C-scan for the targets struck at oblique incidence. \n \n \nFigure 13: Comparison between the level of damage (as measured by C-scan) for both the front plate \nand rear plate; after perforation. \nJournal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design, Vol. 45 (6), pp. 439-450, (2010). \n 21\n4.0 CONCLUSIONS \n \nTwo 6-mm thick CFRP laminates have been bonded together to evaluate the \nballistic performance of such a system when subjected to impact and penetration by a \n\u220512-mm stainless steel projectile at velocities ranging from 187 m\/s to 1219 m\/s. The \nfollowing conclusions are drawn from the data: \n (1) Over the impact velocity range of interest, an obliquely-angled target does not \nhave any further effect on the resistance to penetration other than offering more material \nto penetrate. Furthermore, once the panel was perforated, the level of damage, as \nmeasured by C-Scan for both the front plate and rear plate, was similar. This raises the \nprospect of reducing experimental testing at oblique angles, if the behaviour at normal \nincidence is known. \n(2) It was found that the ballistic performance of the two-part system was \nimproved compared with similar thin CFRP laminates over the impact energy range of \ninterest. Further, this improvement on the ballistic performance occurred with an increase \nin damage when compared to thinner laminates.  \n(3) During oblique penetration, the rear plate deformed in the direction \nperpendicular to the plane of the laminate. This resulted in a mostly circular delamination \npattern whereas the front plate suffered asymmetric damage. \n(4) Failure of the adhesive bonding layer occurred for all targets except on an \noblique target struck at the lowest impact energy. This was most likely due to shear-\ninduced failure processes occurring at the bond line and localised separation of the rear \nCFRP laminate plate as petalling ensued. \n \n5.0 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nPart of this work was carried out during Mr Pierre Bourque\u2019s Military Vehicle \nTechnology MSc course and consequently we are very grateful for his contribution.
