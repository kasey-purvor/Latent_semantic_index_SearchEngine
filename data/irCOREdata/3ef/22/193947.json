Introduction\n[2] The UHF spectrum is in quite intensive use for\nbroadcast media and cellular communications, and the\n2 GHz region is likely to become particularly stretched as\nthe take-up and content of 3G wireless networks expand\n[Ofcom, 2006]. These applications use point to area\nnetworks, which are vulnerable to interference from\nother users, so it is important to have a robust and\naccurate means of estimating the range of a signal. This\nrange of a UHF signal can be enhanced by a number of\nmechanisms [Crane, 1981; Bean and Dutton, 1968]\nwhich depend on prevailing meteorological conditions,\nand the complexity of the situation is greater in coastal\nareas where enhanced transhorizon propagation is par-\nticularly prevalent. The data presented here provide\nimportant information about the behaviour of the signal\nstrength for the top few percent of the time, which can\nonly be obtained from a long term study, and also gives\ninsight into the diurnal and annual variations of the data,\nwhich might be used for adaptive power control to\nmitigate against interference.\n[3] ITU-R Recommendation P1546-2 [ITU, 2005b]\ngives predictions for the propagation factor at frequen-\ncies of 100, 600 and 2000 MHz for paths over warm sea,\ncold sea or land (warm sea is exemplified by the\nMediterranean and cold sea by the North Sea). Interpo-\nlation is allowed for between the three frequencies and\nbetween terrain types for mixed paths. However, the\ncurves for 2000 MHz are extrapolated from measure-\nments at lower frequencies, and since data derived\nfrom experimental observations at the frequency of\ninterest are preferable to extrapolated data, measure-\nments at 2 GHz have recently been made over three\nover-sea paths in the British Channel Islands to help\nrectify this deficiency. A summary of these measure-\nments is presented in this paper together with a\nstatistical analysis of the received signal strength\nvariations and a comparison with predictions made\nusing current ITU-R Recommendations.\n[4] The measurement campaign started on the 22nd\nAugust 2003 and continued until the end of September\n2005 for Alderney, until the end of November 2005 for\nGuernsey and until the 15th August 2005 for Sark. The\nantenna heights were such that the ends of the links were\nbeyond the optical horizon except for the shortest path,\nwhich was within the optical horizon for most of the\ntime. The tidal range in the Channel Islands is large (up\nto 10 m in Guernsey on a spring tide), and consequently\nthe obscuration due to the bulge of the earth varies\nsignificantly with tide height. Aside from this influence,\npropagation is strongly enhanced at all sites by effects\nrelated to changes in the refractive index profile of the\nlower troposphere (i.e. super-refraction and ducting).\nSignal enhancement occurs for periods of a few hours\nor days and approximately simultaneously for all receiv-\ning stations. Its magnitude increases for the more distant\nstations. The overall percentage time for which enhance-\nment occurs depends on the exact definition of enhance-\nRADIO SCIENCE, VOL. 42, RS4019, doi:10.1029\/2006RS003616, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Engineering, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0048-6604\/07\/2006RS003616$11.00\nRS4019 1 of 15\nment, as discussed below. However, it is of the order of\n10% of the time on the longest path.\n2. Experiment\n2.1. Equipment\n[5] The geographical layout of the transmitter and\nthree receiver sites is illustrated in Figure 1, and the\nlatitude\/longitude of all stations is given in Table 1. A\nnominally 100W CW transmitter located on the Jersey\ncoast radiated vertically polarised signals at 2.015 GHz\nto receiving stations located on Sark (distance 22 km),\nGuernsey (33.5 km) and Alderney (49.5 km). The\ntransmitter had two antennas at 17.5 m above mean sea\nlevel (msl) and two at 14.5 m above msl. One pair (high\nand low) were pointed towards Alderney, while the other\npair were directed halfway between Guernsey and Sark\nand were used for transmissions to both of these receiv-\ning stations.\n[6] Each receiver site was provided with two antennas,\nat 14 and 10 metres above (msl) in Guernsey and at 13\nand 10 m above msl in Alderney and in Sark. All\nantennas were shrouded Yagis (Jaybeam 7360) with a\n\u00013 dB beamwidth of 27\u0001 and a gain of 17 dBi according\nto the manufacturer but measured to be 14.5 dBi. The\nmeasured value has been used in the calculations pre-\nsented below.\n[7] All receiving sites were provided with AOR 5000 +\n3 general coverage receivers, together with a PC for\ncontrol and data recording purposes. Accurate synchro-\nnisation between the transmitting and receiving equip-\nment was achieved by means of PC-mounted GPS cards,\nwhich also provided accurate frequency references at\neach site.\n2.2. Calibration\n[8] Calibration was done by comparing the received\nsignal to that produced by a known input from an\naccurate signal generator for a range of different signal\nstrength values. This was done several; times over the\nperiod of data collection, and the variation seen between\nthe calibration curves produced was of the order of 1 dB.\n[9] Measurements were made at the feeds to the\ntransmit antennas to determine losses in the transmitter\nstation. For each receiver station, cable losses were\nestimated from the manufacturer\u2019s data. Care was taken\nto ensure that the length of cable from each high antenna\nwas equal to the length from the corresponding low\nantenna, so that the two signals at a particular receiving\nstation are directly comparable. Connector losses can be\ndiscounted as they are also present during receiver\ncalibration. In summary, the signal power at the receiver\ncan be viewed as resulting from 100 W transmitted\npower reduced by system losses at both ends of the link,\nfurther reduced by the propagation losses. The system\nlosses are estimated as 15.8 dB for Alderney and 11.1 dB\nfor each of Guernsey and Sark. Calibrations of the\nreceiver sensitivity were undertaken in December 2003,\nMay 2004 and May 2005 for each of the three sites, very\nsimilar results being obtained on each occasion.\n[10] Further adjustments were made to validate the\nrelative signal strengths of the high antenna to those of\nthe low antenna for each receiver station. To do this, the\n99th, 90th, 50th, 10th and 1st percentiles of signal\nstrength from each of the two antennas was plotted as\na function of combined transmitter and receiver antenna\nheight. Small amounts were added or subtracted from\nthe whole data-set of each antenna in order to align the\nlow antenna curves with those of the high antenna. It was\nfound that for Sark, no correction was necessary, as the\ncurves were already aligned. For Alderney, the 90th\npercentile curves of the low antenna were aligned\nwith those of the high antenna, but the low antenna\nsignal strength exceeded that of the high antenna for the\nmedian curves. As the median is more relevant to ITU\nRecommendation P1546-2, a correction was made to\nreduce the low antenna signal strength by 1 dB and\nincrease the high antenna signal strength by 1 dB. For\nGuernsey, the upper antenna signal was increased by\n2 dB and the lower reduced by 2 dB to achieve approx-\nimate collinearity for all the percentiles considered.\n[11] In addition to these changes, the Guernsey signal\nwas found to be attenuated by a further 10 dB by the\nwalls of the lighthouse on which the antennas were\nmounted. This near field attenuation of the walls was\nclearly demonstrated over a period of several hours\nduring a period of non-enhanced signal strength (which\nprovides a very predictable signal). The antennas were\nmoved away from the wall and the signal strengths when\nplotted, were parallel to the expected signal strengths for\neach antenna, but 10 dB higher. The expected signal\nstrengths were based on the previous two tidal cycles. No\nother variation was seen during this test, and none were\nlikely, from a theoretical viewpoint, so it is assumed that\nthis 10 dB offset is a static one, which can simply be\ndeducted from the Guernsey signals. After the test, the\noriginal mounting positions were maintained due to the\nweather protection they provided, and a 10 dB offset was\nadded to the Guernsey high and low antenna signals.\n2.3. Operation\n[12] The system was scheduled to alternate between\nthe Jersey-Sark\/Guernsey and Jersey-Alderney paths,\nand between the high and low elevation antennas (meas-\nurements were only made between high elevation anten-\nnas and between low elevation antennas). In each\nminute, each receiving station recorded the signal power\nduring two 1-second intervals on each of its antennas,\ngiving 2880 data points per day per antenna. In the data\nRS4019 SIDDLE ET AL.: PROPAGATION AT 2 GHz\u2014OBSERVATIONS\n2 of 15\nRS4019\nrepresented here, each 1-second transmission is repre-\nsented by a single value, which is converted to absolute\npower at the receiver input via calibration tables.\n3. Environmental Data\n3.1. Tidal\n[13] The effective heights of the antennas above sea\nlevel at any time depends on the tide height and are\nestimated using tide prediction tables for Jersey, Guern-\nsey and Alderney. The Guernsey tables are also used for\nSark as no annual tide tables are published for this island.\nBy comparison with the daily tidal data provided by the\nBBC Weather Centre, the maximum discrepancy in sea\nlevel between Sark and Guernsey is 40 cm, but for most\nof the time, the difference will be much less than this.\nThe range of the tide and the time of the extrema vary\namongst the islands. About an hour\u2019s difference in\ntiming between Alderney and Jersey is the maximum\ntemporal difference seen, and ignoring this could at\nworst, give about 2.5 metres error in antenna height.\n[14] The sea surface height will also be affected by up\nto half a metre either way from this value by air pressure\nchanges with a consequent effect on the received signal\npower. Similarly, wave height and meteorological con-\nditions alter the signal power.\n3.2. Meteorological\n[15] In order to interpret the changing signal levels in\nterms ducting or other refractive phenomenon, meteoro-\nlogical data were collected from a number of sites for the\nduration of the experiment. These were obtained from\nmeteorological stations at Alderney, Guernsey and Jersey\nairports, which are at heights of 89, 102 and 84 m above\nmean sea level respectively. Each receiver is within\n10 km of the nearest airport. Meteorological data were\nalso collected from the Channel Light Vessel, situated\nabout 70 km northwest of the mid-point of the Jersey-\nAlderney path. The nominal height for this station is five\nmetres above sea level. The positions of the meteorolog-\nical stations are given in Table 2.\n4. Example Measurements\n[16] Figure 2 shows the signal power at each receiver\nfor a period of five days in April 2004. The low antenna\nsignal strengths are plotted in black, while the difference\nbetween high antenna signal strengths and low antenna\nsignal strengths is in grey. A 12-hourly oscillation is\napparent on the first few days. This is approximately\nconsistent with diffraction over the changing height of\nthe earth\u2019s bulge as the tide rises and falls. The observed\nchange in signal strength is 1.1 to 1.4 dB per metre\nchange in tide height, whereas ITU Recommendation\nP.526 estimates 1.6 dB\/m. The tidal variation becomes\nless clear with increasing range from Sark to Alderney,\nFigure 1. Map depicting transmitter and receiver\nlocations in the Channel Islands. The path lengths are\n49 km for Jersey to Alderney, 33 km for Jersey to\nGuernsey and 21 km for Jersey to Sark.\nTable 1.

The reduction\nin loss is up to about 15 dB on the shortest path to Sark\nand about 30 dB on the longest path to Alderney. During\nthe enhanced period, the propagation loss is much less\ndependent on range and on tide height than it is for\nnormal propagation (which depends on diffraction).\nFurthermore, during the period of enhancement, deep\n(\u000320 dB) fading is seen on a scale of around an hour,\nwhereas the non-enhanced signal is rather more constant.\nThis change of signal strength and fading character is\ntypical of periods of enhancement throughout the data.\n5. Received Power Distribution\n[18] Tables 3\u20138 present the cumulative frequency\ndistributions of received signal power for the six links\ndescribed above (three paths, each with two antenna\nheights). The data in these tables is presented as a\nfunction of transmitter antenna height and receiver an-\ntenna height separately, each rounded to the nearest\nmetre. The five sections of each table give the value that\nthe received power expected exceeded for 99, 90, 50 10\nand 1 percent of the time over a year.\nFigure 2. Examples of data from the three receiving sites for five days in April 2004. The low\nantenna signals are shown in black (left hand scale) and the difference (high antenna signal minus\nlow antenna signal) is shown in grey (right hand scale).\nRS4019 SIDDLE ET AL.: PROPAGATION AT 2 GHz\u2014OBSERVATIONS\n4 of 15\nRS4019\n[19] The total number of data recorded for each com-\nbination of antenna heights is given in Tables 9\u201314. Due\nto various outages, the number of data from each season\nvaries considerably, so rather than using simple percen-\ntiles, an algorithm was devised which gives equal im-\nportance to each season. To do this, the data are all put\ntogether in order of signal strength and each datum is\ngiven a weighting according to the season in which it\nwas measured. Data from summer will tend to have a\nhigher weighting than those from winter, to make up for\nfewer recorded data in the summer. Then defining the xth\npercentile to be S dBm means that all signal strength\nvalues less than S dBm contribute x% of the total weight\nof all data. This algorithm was used to determine the\nvalues in Tables 3\u20138.\n[20] Figure 3 presents cumulative frequency distribu-\ntions of the received signal strengths at the receiver for\neach antenna.

The values represented here use the same\nalgorithm as the data in the tables to give equal weight-\ning to each season. The overall signal strength variation\nincreases with range, being smallest for Sark and largest\nfor Alderney, as expected. For Sark, the top and bottom\ntails of each curve are similar in size, and this approx-\nimate symmetry about the median is consistent with the\ntide being the main influence on signal strength at Sark.\nHowever, for Alderney the tail at high signal strength is\nmuch more prominent than the lower tail indicating the\nsignal strength at Alderney is also influenced by ducting\nand refraction.\n[21] Figure 3 shows that the maximum signal strength\nfor each of the paths is around \u000140 or \u000145 dBm. This is\nmuch higher than even the signal strengths predicted\nusing only free-space loss, which are \u000169.0 dBm,\n\u000161.1 dBm and \u000157.0 dBm for Alderney, Guernsey\nand Sark respectively. One explanation of this is that the\nenergy is trapped in a layer some tens of metres wide.\nInstead of spreading out in two dimensions, as described\nby the Friis formula, the wavefronts are constrained to\nTable 4.

This recommendation aims to predict path\nlosses due to diffraction over the earth\u2019s curvature using\nonly the antenna heights and range, taking no account of\nducting or refraction by the atmosphere (i.e. earth radius\nenhancement factor, k = 1). As such, this represents a\nmethod of comparison between the stations of only the\nmore predictable part of the signal strength. For each of\nthe six receiver antennas, the mean height of transmitter\nand receiver antennas above sea level was used to obtain\na predicted signal strength, which is shown in row 3 of\nTable 15.\n[23] For comparison with the predicted values, a mean\n\u2018cold-weather\u2019 signal strength was calculated from the\nobservations. A threshold signal strength was chosen for\neach of the six receiver antennas, to separate \u2018cold-\nweather\u2019 values from the enhanced signal strength\ncaused by strong refraction effects. All the observations\nwhich lay below this threshold were averaged to make\nthe mean \u2018cold-weather\u2019 signal strength given in row 2 of\nTable 15. The thresholds are given in the first row of the\ntable, and the differences (observation minus prediction)\nare given in the final row. In effect this \u2018cold weather\nmean\u2019 never differed from the general mean by more\nthan 3 dB. The differences between theory and observa-\ntion are notably large, suggesting that some refractive\neffect is at work all the time. Furthermore, the discrep-\nancy increases with range from between Sark and Alder-\nney, so the observed dependence on range is less than\nthat predicted by diffraction.\n[24] The measured data have also been compared with\npredictions made using ITU-R Recommendation P1546-2.\nThis recommendation is based upon empirical data and\ngives estimates of the signal strength exceeded 1%, 10%\nand 50% of the time only as a function of transmitter and\nreceiver antenna heights.\n[25] The differences between observed and predicted\nreceived power levels were calculated for each possi-\nble combination of heights of each pair of antennas.\nThe differences were then weighted by the number of\ndata available at that pair of heights, as given in\nTables 9\u201314, and a weighted mean was derived for\nTable 9.

The results are\nshown in Table 16.\n[26] The observed median signal strengths exceed\npredictions by 10\u201315 dB for all paths and there is a\ntrend of greater excess for a longer path and a lower\nantenna, indicating that the loss due to diffraction over\nthe earth\u2019s bulge is being partially circumvented. This\nsuggests that ducting may be more important a mech-\nanism of propagation for this frequency than was\napparent from P1546-2. The other notable trend is\nthat signal strengths exceed predictions by broadly\nsimilar amounts for the median and 1% levels, but\nby much less at the 10% level. This suggests that,\ncompared to the prediction, much less everyday (i.e.\ntidal) variation is seen on these three paths, but\nenhanced propagation (i.e. a couple of days per month\nin the summer where the path loss reduces by 20 dB)\nis more prevalent.\n7. Seasonal and Diurnal Variations\n[27] Although an attempt has been made to make the\npercentiles of signal strength representative of a whole\nyear, the occurrence of enhanced signal is very depen-\ndent on the occurrence of warm weather in any year.\nAlthough it is useful to resolve the significance of air\ntemperature, sea temperature and other meteorological\nfactors on the occurrence of enhanced signal strength,\nthis analysis is reported in the paper accompanying this\n[Gunashekar et al., 2007]. Here, the analysis is kept to\nstatistics of the regular annual and diurnal variations, so\nthat the data are potentially useful to predict enhance-\nment without recourse to any model or assumption.\n[28] Diurnal and seasonal variations were previously\nreported using a definition of enhancement related to the\nmean value of signal strength at each receive antenna\n[Siddle and Warrington, 2005]. However, in order to\ncompare the likelihood of enhanced propagation between\nthe different paths, a more objective definition of an\nenhanced signal is used here, which is equally valid for\nAlderney with its relatively small tidal range and large\nenhancements and for Sark with its larger tidal range and\nlesser enhancements. To achieve this, all the non-\nenhanced signals for a particular receiver antenna (using\nthresholds given in Table 15) were plotted against the\ncombined height of transmitter and receiver antennas.

Enhancement was deemed to have\noccurred when the actual signal strength exceeded this\nestimate by a given value, called the clearance.\n[29] Figure 4 shows the percentage of time for which\neach of the signals is enhanced by a clearance of 10 dB\nas a function of the time of day of each measurement.\nThis plot uses all the data, so winter and summer days\nare combined here. The diurnal variation is very similar,\nwith each path showing a minimum around 0700 UT and\na maximum around 1700 UT. This fits well with the\ndiurnal temperature variation, although the mechanism\ncausing the enhancement may be directly linked to air\ntemperature at a particular height, or may be an indirect\neffect, such as the land breeze\/sea breeze diurnal oscil-\nlation. Variation is seen in the magnitude of the enhance-\nment probability with path. The peak probability at\nAlderney high antenna reaches 22%, while Guernsey\nand Sark reach only 10% and 5% respectively. The\nminimum amount of enhancement at Alderney is 10%,\nwhile that at the other sites drops almost to zero. Another\nfeature is that the low antennas at each site have a\nslightly higher occurrence of enhancement that the high\nantennas. This is because the non-enhanced value of the\nsignal strength is slightly lower for the lower antennas,\nwhile the occurrence of enhancement seems to typically\naffect both antennas at a particular site equally, being\nindependent of height. Since the enhancement is defined\nagainst a base level of non-enhanced signals, the effec-\ntive size of the enhancement is therefore slightly larger\nfor the lower antennas.\n[30] Figure 5 shows the variation of the same quantity\nover the year, using all the data and a 10 dB clearance.\nAgain, the three paths are qualitatively similar, with the\nmagnitude of the effect an increasing function of path\nlength, and the maximal percentages are similar. How-\never, in the winter, the occurrence of enhancement\npractically vanishes for all the paths. Again, low antenna\nvalues exceed high antenna values slightly. Enhanced\nsignals generally occur between March and September,\nwhich again corresponds with the thermal cycle.\n[31] These results generally agree with those obtained\nwhen enhancement is more simply defined as 10 dB\nabove the mean of the signal strength at a particular\nantenna. However, for smaller clearances, the tidal var-\niation will dominate, introducing noise into the diurnal\nand annual variations seen here. Using the method used\nTable 13.

Each of the curves is similar in shape, having\na steep part for smaller values of clearance and a flatter\npart at larger values. Furthermore, the break point\nbetween these parts occurs at a different value of\nclearance for each path. From Figure 6, an approximate\noverall percentage of enhancement can be given for a\nbroad range of definitions of enhancement. Thus, the\nAlderney signal can be said to be enhanced for about\n10% of the time if enhancement is defined as an increase\nof 15\u201325 dB on the tidal best-fit estimate.\n8. Concluding Remarks\n[33] Signal strength data have been presented from 2\nGHz transhorizon links showing diurnal and seasonal\nvariations and a dependence on path length and transmitter\nheight and two different propagation regimes have been\nidentified. Normal propagation is seen at most times, and\ngives a signal strength which depends strongly on the tide\nheight, decreasing by 1.6 dB per metre increase in tide\nheight and yet the mean signal strength is 10\u201325 dB above\nthe signal strength predicted using ITU Recommendation\nP.526-9 (which has been configured to ignore ducting and\nrefraction). Since the evaporation duct is an almost per-\nmanent feature of the maritime atmosphere, it is assumed\nthat this propagation mechanism is some mixture of low-\nlevel ducting and diffraction.\n[34] The dramatic changes in signal strength between\nnormal and enhanced levels occur simultaneously on all\nTable 16.

The enhanced state is typified\nby signal strengths at or exceeding free-space values,\nvery little dependence on range and antenna height and\nfading on a scale of about an hour. If an enhanced signal\nis defined as one exceeding its normal observed level by\n10 dB, then the Alderney signal was enhanced about\n17% of the time, while those received in Guernsey and\nSark were enhanced 5% and 2% of the time respectively.\nEnhancement is markedly more prevalent in the spring\nand summer and has a diurnal dependence that peaks\naround 1700 UT. Its ultimate cause is therefore believed\nto be a rise in temperature.\n[35] Various percentiles have been derived from the\ndata using an algorithm that compensated for the\nrelative scarcity of summertime data. When compared\nto predictions using ITU Recommendation P.1546-2,\nthe observed median values and the values exceeded\n1% of the time are typically higher by up to 15 dB,\nwhereas for the values exceeded 10% of the time,\nreasonable agreement is seen. This indicates that the\nfrequency of occurrence of enhanced signal strengths\nis underestimated by ITU-R P.1546-2, but also that the\nvariation attributed to normal tide-dependent propaga-\ntion is overestimated by the recommendation. This\ntrend seems to become more pronounced as the path\nlength is increased from Sark to Alderney. The reason\nfor these discrepancies is not currently understood, but\nthese results suggest that ITU-R P154-2 underestimates\nconsiderably the amount of interference possible from\ndistant systems using the upper end of the UHF band.\nThe reasons for the behaviour of the data are inves-\ntigated in the paper accompanying this [Gunashekar et\nal., 2007].\n[36] Acknowledgments.
