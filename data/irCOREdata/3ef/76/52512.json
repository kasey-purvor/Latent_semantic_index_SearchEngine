Quasi-Biennial 23 \nOscillation effects were not included. 24 \n 25 \n 26 \n1. Introduction 27 \nVariations in solar ultraviolet (UV) irradiance that take place over the 11-year solar cycle are known 28 \nto affect the upper stratosphere, where UV absorption by ozone takes place [Hood et al., 1993; 29 \nHaigh, 1994, 1996; Gray et al., 2010]. Increased UV irradiance at solar maximum produces not only 30 \nextra absorption directly, but also enhances the ozone concentration, making the equatorial upper 31 \nstratosphere 1.5-2.5 K warmer compared to solar minimum [Hood, 2004; Crooks and Gray, 2005; 32 \nFrame and Gray, 2010]. An even larger temperature signal associated with the 11-year solar cycle 33 \nhas been observed in the high latitude regions of the lower stratosphere, which is particularly strong 34 \nduring winter [Labitzke and Van Loon, 1988; Gray et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2009]. However, direct 35 \neffects of changes in solar irradiance appear to be too small to cause these high latitude signals 36 \n[Hood, 2004; Gray et al., 2009]. It has therefore been proposed that the solar UV forcing originating 37 \nin the upper equatorial stratosphere may propagate dynamically poleward and downward during 38 \nwinter [Kodera and Kuroda, 2002; Matthes et al., 2004, 2006].  39 \nKodera and Kuroda [2002] proposed a propagation mechanism involving the redistribution of 40 \nplanetary wave forcing during Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter. They suggested that a region of 41 \nanomalously strong westerlies in the subtropical upper stratosphere\/lower mesosphere during solar 42 \nmaximum, in thermal wind balance with an enhanced pole-to-equator temperature gradient in the 43 \nupper stratosphere due to enhanced equatorial heating, may deflect planetary waves poleward. The 44 \nredistribution of planetary wave forcing towards higher latitudes further strengthens the polar 45 \nvortex in the subtropics, so that the zonal wind there becomes even more westerly. As the area of 46 \n3 \n \nanomalous westerly winds expands, this causes a further deflection of planetary waves, and so on, 47 \nso that the westerly anomaly gradually moves poleward and downward.  48 \nThis mechanism was demonstrated in a simple idealized modelling study by Gray et al. [2004], who 49 \nimposed a small easterly anomaly in the subtropical upper stratosphere in early winter, 50 \nrepresentative of solar minimum. This resulted in a consistently more disturbed winter with a 51 \nweaker vortex and earlier sudden warming events compared to their unforced integrations. Matthes 52 \net al. [2004, 2006] successfully reproduced this same behaviour in the NH winter using a more 53 \nrealistic full general circulation model, the Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin Climate Middle Atmosphere 54 \nModel (FUB-CMAM), and obtained a pattern of poleward and downward propagation of zonal wind 55 \nanomalies, similar to observations. However, their modelled signal was much weaker than the 56 \nobserved signals. Also other studies with full chemistry-climate models and realistic solar forcing 57 \ntypically find signals that are weaker than seen in observations or at least at the lower end of 58 \nobserved ranges of peak responses [e.g. Marsh et al., 2007; Austin et al., 2008]. Matthes et al. [2004] 59 \nargued that this could be due to the low variability produced by their model, as the amplitude of the 60 \nresponse to solar forcing may be related to the amplitude of inter-annual variability [see also Kodera 61 \net al., 2003]. Kodera et al. [2003] further noted that the lower mesosphere subtropical jet was not 62 \nvery well reproduced in these simulations, which they suggested may be due to the use of Rayleigh 63 \nfriction as a crude parameterization of gravity wave forcings in the FUB-CMAM. 64 \nRayleigh friction has long been the traditional approach to account for gravity wave effects, but is a 65 \nrather crude method. It simply assumes that a drag must be present that is proportional to the 66 \nambient wind speed, with a height-dependent proportionality factor that is tuned such that a 67 \nrealistic climatology is obtained. It has several drawbacks. Firstly, it is usually applied uniformly in 68 \ntime, latitude and longitude, while real gravity wave sources and breaking events are likely to vary 69 \nwith location and be intermittent [Fritts and Alexander, 2003]. Secondly, it assumes that wave 70 \nbreaking always results in a drag on the mean wind, while in reality it may also accelerate winds in 71 \n4 \n \nsome cases, depending on the wave characteristics and background wind itself. Thirdly, Rayleigh 72 \nfriction does also not conserve momentum [Shepherd et al., 1996; Shepherd and Shaw, 2004].  73 \nA more sophisticated way to account for gravity wave effects that relieves some of these problems is 74 \nby means of a gravity wave parameterization that incorporates some representation of the wave 75 \nbreaking process. This then determines where and when the waves break, and whether they 76 \nstrengthen or weaken the winds as they do so, depending on the wave characteristics and 77 \nbackground winds. The first of such parameterizations were already formulated by Lindzen [1981] 78 \nand Dunkerton [1982], and since then have proven their value in many modelling studies [Fritts and 79 \nAlexander, 2003]. It has been shown recently that the use of a gravity wave parameterization, as 80 \nopposed to Rayleigh friction, can influence the modelled atmospheric response to a CO2 forcing 81 \n[Sigmond et al., 2008; Cnossen et al., 2009; Sigmond and Scinocca, 2010]. 82 \nThere is some evidence that this may be the case for solar forcings as well. Shibata and Kodera 83 \n[2005] compared the results obtained with a traditional Rayleigh friction approach in their model to 84 \nthose obtained with the parameterization described by Hines [1997]. They found that the Hines 85 \nparameterization produced a more realistic semi-annual oscillation (SAO). Differences in the 86 \nresponse to solar forcing between the Rayleigh friction and gravity wave scheme versions of their 87 \nmodel were therefore interpreted as being due to the absence\/presence of the SAO. Further, 88 \nMcCormack et al. [2007] showed that a reduction in Rayleigh friction strength resulted in a more 89 \nrobust solar cycle modulation of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), due to a larger solar cycle 90 \nvariation in model dynamics near the stratopause. These studies thus indicate that the 91 \nrepresentation of gravity wave effects can have consequences for the atmospheric response to solar 92 \nforcing.  93 \nThe first objective of this study is to investigate such influences in more detail. We do this in an 94 \nextension of the study of Gray et al. [2004], using a similar zonal wind forcing in the subtropical 95 \nupper stratosphere. We use the Reading Intermediate General Circulation Model (IGCM3), which 96 \n5 \n \nincludes the troposphere, so that we can follow the response further down in the atmosphere and 97 \nalso assess tropospheric signals. In addition, our model integrations include a seasonal cycle, while 98 \nGray et al. [2004] modelled perpetual January conditions. The focus of our analysis will be on the 99 \npoleward and downward propagation of the response in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), and we 100 \ninvestigate how this propagation is affected by the representation of gravity wave effects in the 101 \nmodel.  102 \nOur study also builds on the work of Haigh et al. [2005] and Simpson et al. [2009] who investigated 103 \nthe tropospheric response to temperature forcings in the lower stratosphere. They used a simplified 104 \nversion of the model we use, with a lower top (at 18.5 hPa compared to 0.1 hPa in our model) and 105 \nno orography, and hence very weak planetary wave activity. They could therefore not study the 106 \ndownward propagation of the response to (an idealized) solar forcing from the upper stratosphere, 107 \nwhere the solar UV and stratospheric ozone interaction takes place, to the lower stratosphere. We 108 \ntake their work a step further, by prescribing a forcing in the upper subtropical stratosphere. This 109 \nallows us to study the downward and poleward propagation of the responses within the 110 \nstratosphere as well as the responses in the troposphere. We stress that we purely focus on 111 \ndynamical propagation mechanisms, as do Haigh et al. [2005], Simpson et al. [2009] and Gray et al. 112 \n[2004]. As a second, but related point of interest, we examine the role of Stratospheric Sudden 113 \nWarming (SSW) events in the response that is produced. SSWs occur in response to strong planetary 114 \nwave forcings, which can cause a temporary breakdown of the winter polar vortex, with zonal winds 115 \nreversing to easterlies and a corresponding warming as a result. As planetary waves are also thought 116 \nto be involved in solar signal propagation, linkages between the occurrence of SSW events and the 117 \npoleward and downward transport of solar signals may be expected. Indeed, the modelling study by 118 \nGray et al. [2004] already showed that a subtropical forcing in the upper stratosphere affects both 119 \nthe timing and frequency of SSWs. Here we re-examine their results with a different model, 120 \nincluding seasonality and the option to use a gravity wave scheme. We also look at the link between 121 \n6 \n \nSSWs and solar forcing from another angle, by studying the effects of the absence\/presence of SSWs 122 \non the responses obtained.  123 \nBoth the sensitivities to gravity wave forcing and SSW occurrence that we find in the responses are 124 \nused as a tool to gain insights in the dynamical mechanisms that are responsible for the poleward 125 \nand downward propagation of the signal within the stratosphere, and for the communication of the 126 \nsignal from the stratosphere into the troposphere. In addition, by quantifying the sensitivity of the 127 \nmodelled responses to gravity wave effects and SSWs, we gain a better understanding of the 128 \nimportance of modelling these aspects of the stratospheric climate correctly. This helps to 129 \nunderstand better why modelling studies so far have been unable to reproduce observed solar 130 \nsignals with the correct strength and timing, and informs future modelling studies that attempt a 131 \nrealistic simulation of solar cycle forcing.  132 \n 133 \n 134 \n2. IGCM3 description and experimental setup 135 \n2.1 IGCM3 description 136 \nThe Reading Intermediate Global Circulation Model 3 (IGCM3) used in our experiments is a general 137 \ncirculation model based on the spectral dynamical core of Hoskins and Simmons [1975]. It accounts 138 \nfor a range of physical processes via parameterization schemes, as described in Forster et al. [2000]. 139 \nThese include a fast radiation scheme based on Morcrette [1990, 1991], a convection scheme based 140 \non Betts [1986], a boundary layer scheme based on Louis [1986], and a slab ocean and land surface 141 \nscheme. In this sense, the IGCM3 is a general circulation model of intermediate complexity, bridging 142 \nthe gap between simple dynamical models and full state-of-the-art GCMs.  143 \n7 \n \nThe model has been used extensively in radiative forcing studies [Forster et al., 2000, Joshi and 144 \nShine, 2003, Shine et al., 2003]. More recently, improvements to the model were made for the 145 \ninvestigation of stratospheric processes and their effect on climate, in particular by providing a 146 \nrealistic simulation of the stratospheric mean state and variability [Bell et al., 2009]. The dynamical 147 \ncore of the model is the same as that of the model used by Haigh et al. [2005] and Simpson et al. 148 \n[2009] for studying solar effects. 149 \nFor this study, a T42 horizontal resolution (triangular truncation at wavenumber 42) was used with 150 \n38 vertical levels from 1000 to 0.1 hPa (16 levels in the troposphere, 19 levels in the stratosphere, 151 \nand 3 levels above 1 hPa). Also, a gravity wave scheme was implemented, used for some of the 152 \nsimulations. The gravity wave scheme is based on Lindzen [1981] and Holton [1982], as described by 153 \nBarnes [1990] and Joshi et al. [1995], and conserves momentum. It includes both orographic and 154 \nnon-orographic waves.  155 \nThe orographic waves are assumed to be stationary (phase speed = 0 m\/s) and have an amplitude 156 \nbased on the sub-grid scale standard deviation of the topography, with a minimum value of 100 m, 157 \nand the zonal wind speed at the surface. The mean orography from the US Naval 1\/6th degree 158 \nresolution dataset is used. A minimum value of 100 m was set to parameterize roughly residual 159 \nbreaking in the uppermost layers of the model of waves from slowly moving features (including over 160 \noceans).  Two types of non-orographic waves, with phase speeds equal to the zonal wind speed at 161 \n500 hPa +20 m\/s and -20 m\/s, respectively, and a fixed amplitude (a tuneable parameter) are 162 \nincluded. This is a simplified representation of non-orographic gravity waves compared to the much 163 \nlarger spectrum of waves that is often included in full climate models extending up to the 164 \nmesosphere (e.g. Garcia et al., 2007). These spectra sometimes have a latitudinal and seasonal 165 \ndependence as well, while our two waves are distributed homogeneously in space and time, 166 \nalthough some temporal and spatial dependence in phase speed is caused through variations in 167 \nzonal wind speed at 500 hPa. Our simplified approach is justified for the following reasons. Firstly, 168 \n8 \n \nour model does not extend into the mesosphere, so that there is little gain in including waves with 169 \nlarge phase speeds that would propagate through the stratosphere (and not break within the model 170 \ndomain). Secondly, Barnes (1990) notes that the overall impact of a relatively broad spectrum of 171 \nwaves on the zonal flow, even compared to just a single orographic mode, is not very large. And 172 \nfinally, the \u201ctrue\u201d spectrum of gravity waves, and their seasonal and latitudinal variation, remains 173 \nnot well known (e.g. Fritts and Alexander, 2003). Including more waves, with or without a 174 \nlatitudinally and seasonally varying source, would thus not necessarily make our simulations more 175 \nrealistic. 176 \n 177 \n2.2 Experimental setup 178 \nTwo control simulations were performed: one that used Rayleigh friction alone to account for gravity 179 \nwave forcing, and another one that used the gravity wave parameterization. These will be referred 180 \nto as RF-C and GWS-C, respectively. When only Rayleigh friction was used, this was employed over 181 \nthe top six model levels ( 0.1-3 hPa) with a time scale of 18 days at the lowest level, reducing to a 182 \ntime scale of 3 days at the top level, over which winds were relaxed toward zero. The overall 183 \nstrength of the Rayleigh friction was chosen such that the zonal mean temperature and zonal wind 184 \nclimatologies for RF-C matched as closely as possible observed climatologies and the climatologies 185 \nobtained with GWS-C. This excludes as much as possible the effects of different background 186 \nclimatologies on the response to the forcing. When the gravity wave scheme was used, a weak 187 \nRayleigh friction was still retained at the top four model levels ( 0.1-1 hPa) with a time scale of 19 188 \ndays at the lowest level reducing to 4.7 days at the top level, to avoid spurious wave reflections from 189 \nthe model top. The Rayleigh friction timescales for the RF and GWS simulations are shown in figure 190 \n1. 191 \n[[insert Figure 1 here]] 192 \n9 \n \nTwo perturbed simulations were also performed and will be referred to as RF-P and GWS-P. The 193 \nperturbation consisted of a relaxation of the zonal winds in the subtropical upper stratosphere over 194 \nthe top five model levels ( 0.1-2 hPa), using a method similar to Rayleigh friction, but relaxing 195 \ntowards -20 m\/s. The forcing was applied at a central latitude of 12.5\u00b0 over a width of 17.5\u00b0, with a 196 \nsinusoidal drop-off with latitude away from the central latitude, similar to that used by Gray et al. 197 \n[2004]. The forcing was only switched on for the duration of 1 month (30 days) in April for the 198 \nSouthern Hemisphere (SH) and October for the Northern Hemisphere (NH), with a 10-day linear 199 \nramp up and down in the months before and after to make them smooth in time. These temporary 200 \nforcings in early winter were chosen because forcing the model throughout the entire winter could 201 \nmake it difficult to separate forcing from response, and because the stratosphere appears to be 202 \nparticularly sensitive to solar perturbations originating from the subtropical upper stratosphere 203 \nduring early winter [Gray et al., 2001; Matthes et al., 2004]. All simulations were run for 50 years 204 \n(18000 model days, with each month 30 days long for simplicity), in order to differentiate internal 205 \nmodel variability from the true dynamic response to the applied perturbations. 206 \nWe did not force the model directly by changing the incoming irradiance and ozone concentration (a 207 \nseasonally varying ozone climatology based on Li and Shine [1995] was used in both control and 208 \nperturbed simulations).  However, by forcing the zonal winds, a corresponding temperature 209 \nresponse in the forcing region is induced via thermal wind balance. The easterly forcing we apply 210 \nacts to reduce the meridional temperature gradient, resulting in a cooling cell over the equator and 211 \na corresponding warming cell at higher latitudes. The structure of the forcing at 1-10 hPa is similar to 212 \nobserved solar signals in October-November [e.g. Frame and Gray, 2010]. For simplicity and to aid a 213 \nstraightforward explanation of the results, we assume the forced runs to represent solar minimum, 214 \nand the control runs to represent solar maximum. This approach has also been followed by other 215 \nstudies investigating solar forcing effects, e.g. Gray et al. [2004]. The forcing we use results initially in 216 \na larger zonal wind anomaly than is observed to be associated with the solar cycle: the model gives a 217 \nmaximum zonal wind signal of 19 m\/s during October, compared to 14 m\/s in observations [Frame 218 \n10 \n \nand Gray, 2010]. However, this is justified, as our aim is not to reproduce solar signals exactly, but 219 \nrather to investigate the relevant propagation mechanisms, and the influences of gravity wave 220 \neffects and SSWs on the signal propagation.  221 \n 222 \n 223 \n3. Results 224 \n3.1 Control simulations 225 \nFigure 2 shows the October-November-December (OND) zonal mean temperature and zonal wind 226 \nclimatologies, together with their standard deviation (shaded), for the GWS-C (left) and RF-C 227 \n(middle) simulations. The difference between the climatologies is also shown (right), with the 228 \nshading now indicating statistical significance. The climatologies for the two simulations are very 229 \nsimilar (which they were designed to be), and capture the main features of the observed zonal mean 230 \ntemperature and wind structures. There are statistically significant differences between the 231 \nsimulations, mainly in the stratosphere, but these differences are relatively small, and in particular 232 \nthe zonal wind in the NH polar vortex matches to a high degree.  233 \n[[insert Figure 2 here]] 234 \nThe GWS-C simulation gives slightly stronger inter-annual variability, with standard deviations in 235 \ntemperature and zonal wind peaking at 3 K and 7 m\/s, respectively, compared to 2.5 K and 5 m\/s for 236 \nRF-C. The distributions of SSW events for the two simulations were determined based on the criteria 237 \ngiven in Charlton and Polvani [2007] and are shown in figure 3. They differ substantially, with the 238 \npeak of the SSW distribution occurring 1-2 months earlier for RF-C than for GWS-C. The SSW 239 \ndistribution for GWS-C is in much better agreement with the observed distribution as reported by 240 \nCharlton and Polvani [2007], in particular for December and January. Note that the higher standard 241 \n11 \n \ndeviations found for GWS-C are not directly related to a higher occurrence frequency of SSW events. 242 \nRather, the higher standard deviations for GWS-C may be related to a higher total wave activity in 243 \nthat simulation, as expressed by EP fluxes and EP flux divergence. The EP fluxes and EP flux 244 \ndivergence for the GWS-C simulation are approximately 25% larger in the NH upper stratosphere in 245 \nOND than for RF-C. 246 \n[[insert Figure 3 here]] 247 \nBoth model simulations are lacking a Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and a realistic semi-annual 248 \noscillation (SAO). The zonal wind at 30-50 hPa in the equatorial regions, where the QBO is normally 249 \ndefined, is permanently easterly. The model does produce an SAO-like oscillation, but this is biased 250 \ntowards easterlies, so that the oscillation is between very weak easterlies at the equinoxes (0 m\/s 251 \nfor RF; 0 to -6 m\/s for GWS) and stronger easterlies during the solstices (-8 m\/s for RF; -12 to -14 m\/s 252 \nfor GWS) rather than between easterlies and westerlies, as in observations.  253 \n 254 \n3.2 Perturbed-control differences  255 \nFigure 4 shows sequences of differences between the perturbed and control integrations for GWS in 256 \nzonal mean temperature (left) and zonal wind (right) for 10-day intervals from the start of November 257 \nto the start of December. The temperature signal clearly moves poleward and downward from Nov 258 \n1-10 to Nov 21-30, until it nearly vanishes in Dec 1-10. The zonal wind signal propagates in 259 \nconjunction with the temperature signal, and there is also a response present in the troposphere 260 \nthroughout November, consisting of a strengthening of zonal winds at 40\u00b0N and a weakening at 261 \n60\u00b0N. This roughly maps on to the Northern Annular Mode (NAM; Thompson and Wallace, 1998], 262 \nalthough we note that the modelled zonal wind response to our forcing is shifted 5\u00b0 northward 263 \ncompared to the NAM dipole pattern observed in observational data, and that also the modelled 264 \ntropospheric jet is located up to 5\u00b0 further north than the observed jet.  265 \n12 \n \n[[insert Figure 4 here]] 266 \nThe poleward and downward movement of the temperature and zonal wind responses in the 267 \nstratosphere is dynamically consistent with the differences in EP flux and EP flux divergence, as 268 \nshown in the left-hand panels of figure 5. The right-hand panels of figure 5 show the transformed 269 \nEulerian-mean [TEM; Andrews and McIntyre, 1976; Andrews et al., 1987] residual circulation, which 270 \nis a measure of the large scale meridional circulation that is induced by wave forcing, i.e. the Brewer-271 \nDobson (BD) circulation in the stratosphere.  272 \n [[insert Figure 5 here]] 273 \nIn Nov 1-10 there is enhanced EP flux into the equator-ward flank of the polar vortex, and enhanced 274 \nEP flux convergence (near 40\u00b0N, 1 hPa). This signifies an increase of the wave forcing on the mean 275 \nflow, which acts to reduce the strength of the polar vortex. The enhanced wave forcing strengthens 276 \nthe BD circulation in the area below, with a corresponding weakening in the region above the 277 \nenhanced wave forcing, effectively moving the circulation downwards. During Nov 11-20 and Nov 278 \n21-30, the upward EP flux into the polar vortex is further enhanced, while the centre of the activity 279 \nmoves poleward. As a result the polar vortex is gradually being weakened from the outside equator-280 \nward flank to its inner core. The pair of positive and negative anomalies in the BD circulation also 281 \nmoves poleward (from 15\u00b0N in Nov 1-10 to 60\u00b0N in Nov 21-30), although the negative anomaly is 282 \nno longer significant by Nov 21-30. In Dec 1-10 the system is recovering, but slightly overshooting, as 283 \nthe EP flux is now reduced and EP flux divergence is enhanced compared to the control run. The 284 \nrelatively weaker planetary wave forcing allows the polar vortex to strengthen again and weakens 285 \nthe high latitude branch of the BD circulation. After Dec 1-10 (not shown), there is very little 286 \nsignificant signal remaining, indicating that the system has largely returned to its equilibrium state. 287 \nThis is in agreement with the observations of Lu et al. [2009] that the NH signals in the polar 288 \nstratosphere have a life span of 30-50 days, which is approximately the thermal relaxation 289 \ntimescale in the lower stratosphere [Newman and Rosenfield, 1997]. 290 \n13 \n \nThe responses obtained from the RF simulations are of similar strength and show similar spatial 291 \npatterns in the stratosphere, but there are some differences in the timing of their poleward and 292 \ndownward propagation. The RF response moves noticeably quicker towards the pole, reaching the 293 \npole 10 days earlier than the GWS response, with most of the downward propagation occurring 294 \nafter that time.   295 \nIn the troposphere, significant responses in the zonal wind are detected, which are substantially 296 \ndifferent for RF and GWS, as shown in figure 6. There is relatively little movement of the 297 \ntropospheric signal over time, and it is most significant for November. Therefore only an average 298 \nresponse for November is shown. The zonal wind response for GWS consists of a weakening of the 299 \nzonal flow at 10-20\u00b0N at 100-200 hPa, a strengthening throughout the depth of the troposphere 300 \ncentred at 40\u00b0N, and a weakening around 60\u00b0N at 250-500 hPa. This means that the core of the jet is 301 \nstrengthened (see figure 2 for the jet position in the control simulations). The RF zonal wind signal 302 \nconsists instead of a weakening from 15-20\u00b0N to 30-35\u00b0N through the depth of the troposphere and 303 \na slight strengthening around 50\u00b0N. This represents a poleward movement of the tropospheric jet. In 304 \nboth cases, the tropospheric responses do not appear to have directly descended from the 305 \nstratosphere. They remain roughly in place throughout November-December, regardless of the 306 \ntemporal evolution of the stratospheric responses. At certain times they are therefore opposite in 307 \nsign to the stratospheric responses. 308 \n[[insert figure 6 here]] 309 \n 310 \n3.3 Effects on timing and frequency distribution of SSWs 311 \nBecause the GWS-C simulation produced an SSW distribution that is in better agreement with 312 \nobservations than the RF-C simulation, the following sections will make use of the GWS results only. 313 \nFigure 7 compares the SSW distributions for the forced and control simulations. The overall shape of 314 \n14 \n \nthe SSW distribution remains the same, but the forced run shows a consistent increase in SSWs 315 \nthroughout winter compared to the control runs. This is in agreement with the finding by Gray et al. 316 \n[2004] that the rest of the NH winter becomes more disturbed as a result of an easterly forcing in 317 \nearly winter in the subtropical upper stratosphere. However, a change in the timing of SSWs, as 318 \nfound by Gray et al. [2004], can not clearly be seen in our results.   319 \n[[insert figure 7 here]] 320 \n 321 \n3.4 SSW effects on the responses 322 \nTo investigate the influence of SSWs on the tropospheric responses to the forcing, we separated the 323 \ndata for the forced and control GWS simulations in years with and without SSWs during OND. For 324 \nboth simulations, 12 years with SSWs and 38 years without SSWs were identified (this included three 325 \nyears with an October SSW for GWS-C, which were not shown in figure 7). As noted previously, the 326 \nzonal wind response in the troposphere resembles a NAM-like pattern. Therefore a NAM-like index 327 \nwas calculated to show the difference in the temporal evolution of the signal between the non-SSW 328 \nand SSW datasets. This index was calculated by subtracting the area-weighted average of the 329 \ngeopotential height for 40-60\u00b0N from the area-weighted average for 60-90\u00b0N.  These latitude bands 330 \nwere chosen specifically to capture the responses most clearly. The geopotential height difference 331 \nwas then normalized by subtracting the mean climatology for the control and perturbed datasets, 332 \nand dividing the result by the standard deviation of the combined datasets. Positive values 333 \ncorrespond to a positive NAM phase and negative values to a negative NAM, although our index is 334 \nnot directly comparable to the NAM due to the different latitude bands used.  Figure 8 shows 335 \npressure-time sections of the response in the normalized geopotential height difference between 336 \n60-90\u00b0N and 40-60\u00b0N for the datasets with and without SSWs.  337 \n15 \n \nFor years with SSWs, stronger poleward propagation of the response to the forcing takes place in the 338 \nstratosphere, so that the positive response in the stratospheric geopotential height difference 339 \noccurs earlier and is stronger as well. However, the overall propagation pattern of a positive signal 340 \nfollowing a negative signal is similar for years with and without SSWs in the stratosphere. In 341 \ncontrast, in the troposphere we find a negative signal around Nov 10 that appears to have 342 \ndescended from the stratosphere for years with SSWs, while we find a signal of the opposite sign 343 \naround the same time, and in fact throughout the whole time interval presented, when years with 344 \nSSWs are excluded. The non-SSW tropospheric response does not appear directly connected to the 345 \nstratospheric response. When the entire dataset (SSW + non-SSW years) is processed, the signal 346 \naround Nov 10 is weaker, while the signal around Nov 20 is stronger. The signals from the two 347 \nconditions thus act to cancel each other out partly around Nov 10, while they add up around Nov 20. 348 \n [[insert figure 8 here]] 349 \n 350 \n 351 \n4. Discussion 352 \n4.1 Influences of gravity wave effects on solar signal propagation 353 \nPrevious modelling studies have demonstrated that the representation of the stratosphere in a 354 \ngeneral circulation model can influence the troposphere [e.g. Boville, 1984; Song and Robinson, 355 \n2004; Sigmond et al., 2008]. Here we build on those findings and show a specific influence of the 356 \nrepresentation of gravity wave effects on the downward and poleward propagation of an idealized 357 \nsolar forcing in the upper stratosphere. Differences between the GWS and RF simulations occur in 358 \nterms of the timing and extent of poleward and downward propagation of the responses in the 359 \nstratosphere, and also in general in the responses in the troposphere, even though the differences 360 \nbetween the RF and GWS simulations in terms of forcing and gravity wave representation are in the 361 \n16 \n \n(upper) stratosphere. The influences we find in the lower stratosphere and troposphere are thus 362 \nindirect.  363 \nThe tropospheric zonal wind response for GWS is to some extent in agreement with observations by 364 \nHaigh et al. [2005], who found that the tropospheric jets are weaker and shift polewards for higher 365 \nsolar activity. The GWS results did not show the change in jet position, but did show a change in 366 \nstrength in the same sense, bearing in mind that our results are presented as solar minimum-367 \nmaximum conditions. The RF results on the other hand showed mostly a change in jet position, but it 368 \nmoved poleward for solar minimum conditions compared to solar maximum, i.e. in the opposite 369 \nsense to the observations by Haigh et al. [2005]. For both RF and GWS the strength of the 370 \ntropospheric zonal wind signal is comparable to the strength of the observed anomalies reported by 371 \nHaigh et al., [2005]. The GWS pattern of a strengthening of the jet at 40\u00b0N with a weakening on 372 \neither side also matches the general pattern of the zonal wind signal observed by Frame and Gray 373 \n[2010], although their pattern is centred at 30-35\u00b0N, while the RF pattern does not. The GWS 374 \nsimulations thus give a more realistic tropospheric response, in better agreement with observations. 375 \nSigmond and Scinocca [2010] found that the sensitivity of the doubled CO2 response to 376 \nparameterized orographic gravity wave drag [Sigmond et al., 2008] was largely due to differences in 377 \nthe control climatologies. In our case, the differences in response to an idealized solar forcing do not 378 \nseem to be related to such differences, as the control climatologies were designed to be similar. We 379 \ncan also exclude the possibility that the differences are related to different distributions of SSW 380 \nevents (which were shown to differ more substantially), as excluding years with SSW events in OND 381 \ndid not result in better agreement between the RF and GWS responses in OND (results not shown). 382 \nShibata and Kodera [2005] interpreted the differences in response they found between their model 383 \nversions with Rayleigh friction and the Hines parameterization scheme in terms of the 384 \nabsence\/presence of an SAO. In our simulations however, we do not get a realistic SAO in either the 385 \n17 \n \nRF or GWS simulations. Therefore, while the SAO may have an influence in reality, it is not the 386 \nreason for the differences we find in our results. We will now explore two alternative explanations. 387 \nFirstly, it may be possible that the gravity wave forcing itself played a role in the propagation and 388 \nmaintenance of the signal, by redistributing gravity wave momentum deposition, similar to how 389 \nplanetary waves are thought to play a role in signal propagation by redistributing their momentum 390 \ndeposition. We therefore examined the difference in gravity wave-induced accelerations between 391 \nthe forced and control GWS runs, which revealed that these always acted to reduce the zonal wind 392 \nresponses found (results not shown). So rather than amplifying the response, the direct effects of 393 \nchanges in gravity wave momentum deposition acted to diminish the response, and we can 394 \neliminate this possibility. 395 \nA second pathway for gravity wave effects to influence the response to our forcing is through 396 \nindirect effects on planetary waves. As noted, the EP fluxes and EP flux divergence were about 25% 397 \nlarger in the NH upper stratosphere during OND for GWS-C compared to RF-C. This is consistent with 398 \nthe finding by McLandress and McFarlane [1993] that longitudinal variations in gravity wave drag 399 \n(which would be missing in a Rayleigh friction approach) can enhance planetary wave amplitudes 400 \nand EP flux divergence. Considering the mechanism proposed by Kodera and Kuroda [2002], this 401 \ncould explain why the stratospheric responses propagate differently for the GWS and RF versions of 402 \nthe model, although the detail of the differences is not straightforward to explain.  403 \nThe stronger planetary wave activity may also be responsible for the slightly stronger inter-annual 404 \nvariability found for GWS. However, this small enhancement in inter-annual variability is not 405 \nsufficient to determine whether a lack of inter-annual variability is responsible for a too weak 406 \nresponse to solar forcing, as suggested by Matthes et al. [2004] and Kodera et al. [2003]. In terms of 407 \nstrength, the responses obtained with the RF and GWS versions of the model are very similar.  408 \n18 \n \nIn conclusion, our results indicate that it is important to model the planetary wave activity correctly, 409 \nand as gravity wave effects can modify this activity substantially, a more realistic representation of 410 \ngravity wave effects seems to be necessary to achieve this. The use of a gravity wave scheme does 411 \nnot only affect stratospheric responses, but also the responses in the troposphere, which become 412 \nmore realistic when the gravity wave scheme is used. We note that our model simulations, despite 413 \nmaking use of a gravity wave scheme, still do not necessarily provide a realistic description of gravity 414 \nwave effects, as strong assumptions were made on the characteristics of the waves. However, more 415 \ninformation on the global distribution of gravity wave effects is becoming available now [e.g. 416 \nAlexander et al., 2008] and future studies that attempt to realistically model the response to solar 417 \nforcing should take advantage of this. 418 \n 419 \n4.2 Influences of SSW events on solar signals 420 \nSeparating our data into years with and without SSW events in OND showed that responses are 421 \nsubstantially different under both conditions. Years with SSWs are highly disturbed, and typically 422 \nhave a strong planetary wave forcing in the high latitude upper stratosphere, causing the polar 423 \nvortex to break down. Again, considering the Kodera and Kuroda [2002] mechanism of solar signal 424 \npropagation, we would expect poleward and downward propagation to be enhanced under such 425 \nconditions, and that is indeed what we observe. During years with SSWs a negative stratospheric 426 \nsignal appears to descend down into the troposphere directly, becoming strongest there around Nov 427 \n10. This is followed by a positive stratospheric response, which also appears to descend down, 428 \nalthough the tropospheric response, while positive also, is not significant. In contrast, when years 429 \nwith SSWs are excluded, the tropospheric signals are positive throughout and do not change in 430 \nconjunction with the time-varying changes in the stratosphere. The tropospheric signals appear 431 \ntherefore more disconnected from the stratospheric signals in this case.  432 \n19 \n \nThis does not mean that there is no connection between the phase of the NAM in the troposphere 433 \nand stratosphere when no SSWs are present, but suggests that different types of troposphere-434 \nstratosphere coupling are dominant for disturbed (with SSWs) and quiet (no SSWs) conditions. The 435 \nmechanism responsible for the non-SSW signals is unlikely to be a direct tropospheric extension of 436 \nthe mechanism responsible for the poleward and downward propagation of the stratospheric 437 \nsignals. In other words, those tropospheric signals do not appear to be due to a change in planetary 438 \nwave forcing, and an associated change in a mean meridional circulation, extending from the 439 \nstratosphere into the troposphere, as this should have resulted in signals of the same sign in both 440 \nthe stratosphere and troposphere. We therefore discuss two alternative coupling mechanisms. 441 \nThe first mechanism involves changes in the tropospheric mean meridional circulation, forced by 442 \nchanges in eddy momentum fluxes associated with synoptic waves within the troposphere [Simpson 443 \net al., 2009]. The changes in eddy momentum fluxes are brought about by changes in  temperature 444 \ngradients and zonal wind accelerations at the tropopause, in response to changes in the lower 445 \nstratospheric temperature structure and flow. Simpson et al. [2009] demonstrated the above 446 \nmechanism by modelling the effect of an altered latitudinal temperature structure in the lower 447 \nstratosphere on the troposphere. They showed that the response slowly develops in the upper 448 \ntroposphere, over about 10 days, and gradually spreads to the lower troposphere, with the main 449 \nresponse structure established after about 20 days.  450 \nIn our results we do not see a clear downward movement of the signal from the upper troposphere 451 \ninto the lower troposphere over time, even though our model is a more advanced version of the 452 \nmodel used by Simpson et al. [2009]. Also, in our experiments the stratospheric signal does not 453 \npenetrate down into the lower stratosphere when years with SSWs are excluded, while there is still 454 \na clear tropospheric response. It is therefore unlikely that the above mechanism is responsible for 455 \nour tropospheric response, although it is still possible that tropospheric eddies are involved in 456 \n20 \n \namplifying\/maintaining the tropospheric response (see also Kushner and Polvani, 2004; Song and 457 \nRobinson, 2004], once initiated by some other process. 458 \nThe second mechanism involves changes in the reflection of planetary waves by the stratosphere 459 \nback into the troposphere, where they are subsequently absorbed [Perlwitz and Harnik, 2003, 2004; 460 \nShaw et al., 2010]. Perlwitz and Harnik [2004] argued that this mechanism becomes more important 461 \nwhen the polar vortex is strong, in particular the lower part of the vortex ( 30 hPa), as more wave 462 \nactivity in that case is reflected back into the troposphere, rather than being absorbed by the 463 \nstratosphere. They also found that it is important mainly on short timescales (up to 12 days). 464 \nThis mechanism could potentially explain why we find a different tropospheric signal for years with 465 \nand without SSWs. During years with SSWs, troposphere-stratosphere coupling via reflection of 466 \nplanetary waves would be weak, while the mechanism would be more important, resulting in 467 \nstronger coupling, during years without SSWs, when the polar vortex is stronger. This is consistent 468 \nwith our finding that tropospheric signals of opposite sign appear or become enhanced for years 469 \nwithout SSWs, while no significant signal, or a signal with the same sign as that in the stratosphere 470 \nappears for years with SSWs. 471 \nPrevious studies have shown that there is a strong coupling between the troposphere and 472 \nstratosphere associated with SSWs [Baldwin and Dunkerton, 2001; Charlton and Polvani, 2007], but 473 \nthis appears to be a more direct coupling, with signals from the stratosphere apparently descending 474 \ndown into the troposphere. This is indeed what we observe in our results with SSWs, although most 475 \nof the responses are not significant. This could be due to the fact that the datasets with SSWs are 476 \nmuch shorter than the datasets without SSWs, and within the SSW datasets the SSWs also occurred 477 \nat different times. This gives a noisier dataset and makes it harder to establish a significant response. 478 \nA second possibility is that our forcing during years with SSWs could be relatively less important to 479 \nthe troposphere than it is during years without SSWs, due to the dominance of the SSW influence on 480 \nthe troposphere-stratosphere coupling in years with SSWs. 481 \n21 \n \nFinally, we note that the tropospheric responses of the SSW and non-SSW are sometimes of the 482 \nopposite sign and can therefore act to cancel each other out. This could be a possible reason for 483 \ndifficulties in establishing a significant tropospheric signal in observational data, as both disturbed 484 \nand undisturbed years are normally included. 485 \n 486 \n4.3 QBO influences 487 \nThe interaction between the QBO and solar forcing is still unclear. Some studies have found that 488 \nsolar forcing influences the QBO [McCormack et al., 2007] or that the QBO affects solar signals 489 \n[Labitzke and Van Loon, 1988; Gray et al., 2004; Labitzke et al., 2006], while others find little 490 \ninteraction [Austin et al., 2008]. Lu et al. [2009] and Ito et al. [2009] found that the effects of the 491 \nQBO on solar signal propagation occur predominantly in late winter.  492 \nOur results were obtained with permanently weak easterlies in the equatorial stratosphere, so that 493 \nany interactions between solar forcing and the QBO have not been considered. However, as we 494 \nfocus on early winter, the absence of a QBO may not have had a large effect. Still, the QBO affects 495 \nthe distribution of planetary wave activity, which plays a key role in the poleward and downward 496 \npropagation of the signal in the stratosphere. Inclusion of a realistic QBO could therefore in principle 497 \nmodify our results somewhat. On a background of westerly winds in the equatorial stratosphere, an 498 \neasterly forcing should still have the effect of deflecting waves poleward, but the strength of the 499 \nsignal and the timing and extent of poleward propagation might be different.  500 \n 501 \n 502 \n5. Summary and conclusions 503 \n22 \n \nOur results broadly confirm the mechanism for solar signal propagation in the stratosphere 504 \nproposed by Kodera and Kuroda [2002]. We find that, in agreement with their theory, the 505 \nredistribution of planetary wave activity can strengthen an initial forced signal, and transport it 506 \npolewards and downwards from the equatorial upper stratosphere. We find that the type of 507 \nrepresentation of gravity wave effects in our model influences this process, changing the timing and 508 \nextent of poleward and downward signal propagation in the stratosphere. This takes place most 509 \nlikely through indirect effects of gravity wave-induced accelerations on planetary waves. The results 510 \nobtained with the gravity wave scheme are more realistic than those obtained with Rayleigh friction, 511 \nas they are in better agreement with observed solar signals, in particular in the troposphere. 512 \nThe GWS results also produce a more realistic distribution of SSW events. The absence\/presence of 513 \nSSW events has an effect on the propagation of the response to our forcing, mainly in the 514 \ntroposphere. For years with SSWs tropospheric signals appear to descend directly from the 515 \nstratosphere, while they appear more disconnected when SSW years are excluded. We suggest that 516 \nthis is due to different types of troposphere-stratosphere coupling being active under conditions 517 \nwith and without SSWs. Under quiet conditions, a signal in the troposphere of the opposite sign to 518 \nthat in the stratosphere may be generated through small modifications in the reflection of planetary 519 \nwaves back into the troposphere. Once initiated, this signal may be maintained and\/or strengthened 520 \nlocally through changes in eddy momentum fluxes. In contrast, under disturbed conditions, when 521 \nSSWs occur, the troposphere-stratosphere coupling occurs more directly, and the tropospheric 522 \nresponse is an extension of that in the stratosphere. 523 \nThe forcing also increases the number of SSWs, but does not influence their timing, as found by Gray 524 \net al. [2004]. We therefore confirm only part of the findings of Gray et al. [2004]. Their result that 525 \nearlier SSWs occurred when an easterly forcing in the subtropical upper stratosphere was applied 526 \nmay have been related to the absence of a seasonal cycle in their model integrations.  527 \n 528 \n23 \n \nAcknowledgements 529 \nWe are very grateful to three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments, which helped 530 \nto improve the original manuscript. 531 \n 532 \n 533 \nReferences 534 \nAlexander, M.J., J.
