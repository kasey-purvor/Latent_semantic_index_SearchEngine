The theory of\nthe phenomenon is developed and shown to be in good agreement with the experiments.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevLett.101.065303 PACS numbers: 67.25.dk, 47.20.Ky, 47.27.\u0001i, 67.25.dt\nA highly excited state of a system with numerous de-\ngrees of freedom, characterized by a directional energy\nflux through frequency scales, is referred to as turbulent\n[1,2]. Like the familiar manifestations of vortex turbulence\nin fluids, turbulence can also occur in systems of waves,\ne.g., turbulence of sound waves in oceanic waveguides [3],\nmagnetic turbulence in interstellar gases [4], shock waves\nin the solar wind and their coupling with Earth\u2019s magne-\ntosphere [5], and phonon turbulence in solids [6]. Follow-\ning the ideas of Kolmogorov, the universally accepted\npicture says that nonlinear wave interactions give rise to\na cascade of wave energy towards shorter and shorter\nwavelengths until, eventually, it becomes possible for vis-\ncosity to dissipate the energy as heat. Experiments and\ncalculations show that, most of the time, the Kolmogorov\npicture is correct [2,7,8].\nWe demonstrate below that this picture is incomplete.\nOur experiments with second sound (temperature-entropy)\nwaves in He II show that, contrary to the conventional\nwisdom, acoustic wave energy can sometimes flow in the\nopposite direction too. We note that inverse energy cas-\ncades are known in 2-dimensional incompressible liquids\nand Bose gases [9], and have been considered for quantized\nvortices [10].\nWe find that energy backflow in our acoustic system is\nattributable to a decay instability (cf. the kinetic instability\nin turbulent systems [11]), controlled mainly by nonlinear\ndecay of the wave into two waves of lower frequency\ngoverned by the energy (frequency) conservation law [2]\n!1 \u0002 !2 \u0003!3. Here !i \u0002 u20ki is the frequency of a\nlinear wave of wave vector ki and u20 is the second sound\nvelocity at negligibly small amplitude. The instability\nmanifests itself in the generation of subharmonics. A quite\nsimilar parametric process, due to 4-wave scattering\n(modulation instability), is thought to be responsible for\nthe generation of large wind-driven ocean waves [12].\nDecay instabilities (especially threshold and near-\nthreshold behavior) have been studied for, e.g., spin waves\n[13], magnetohydrodynamic waves in plasma [14], and\ninteracting first and second sound waves in superfluid\nhelium near the superfluid transition [15].\nWe now discuss what happens to a system of acoustic\nwaves far beyond the decay threshold. Modeling the re-\nsultant nonlinear wave transformations in the laboratory is\na potentially fruitful approach that has already yielded\nimportant results for, e.g., the turbulent decay of capillary\nwaves on the surface of liquid H2 [16]. Here, we exploit the\nspecial properties of second sound [17], which enable\nfundamental wave processes to be studied under laboratory\nconditions. Its velocity u2 depends strongly on its ampli-\ntude \u0001T and can be approximated as\n u2 \u0002 u20\u00041\u0003 \u0002\u0001T\u0005; (1)\nwhere the nonlinearity coefficient \u0002 [18], which deter-\nmines the strength of the wave interactions, can be made\nlarge if the temperature is set right.\nOur experiments make use of the high Q cryoacoustical\nresonator described previously [7], excited close to one of\nits resonant frequencies. It enables very large second sound\nstanding wave amplitudes to be attained for modest levels\nof excitation. Its Q factor, determined from the widths of\nlongitudinal resonances at small heat flux densities, was\nQ\u0006 1000 for resonant numbers p \u0007 10 and Q\u0006 3000 for\n30< p< 100. Figure 1 presents typical results obtained\nwhen driving at a relatively high resonant frequency !d\n(the 96th longitudinal resonance of the cell). Those in\nFigs. 1(a) and 1(b) reproduce our earlier observation of\nthe direct Kolmogorov-like cascade of second sound waves\nin He II [7], when driving on resonance. Figures 1(c) and\n1(d) show that tiny changes in driving frequency can\nproduce marked changes in the shape and spectrum of\nthe standing wave. The formation of the spectral peaks\nnear 12 ,\n1\n3 , and\n2\n3 \b!d satisfies the frequency conservation\nlaw with !1 \u0002 !d, supporting our inference that the in-\nstability is controlled mainly by 3-wave interactions. When\nthe instability develops, huge distortions of the initially\nperiodic signal occur. Although it remains nearly periodic,\nits characteristic period exceeds that of the driving force\nand its amplitude can become more than twice that at the\ndriving frequency.\nTo characterize the instability quantitatively, we use the\nenergy contained in the low-frequency part of the spectrum\nPRL 101, 065303 (2008) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending8 AUGUST 2008\n0031-9007=08=101(6)=065303(4) 065303-1 \u00a9 2008 The American Physical Society\n!<!d,\n ELF \u0002 12\n\u0001\n@C\n@T\n\u0002 X\n!<!d\nj\u0001T!j2; (2)\nas an indicator. Figure 2 shows the dependence of ELF on\nthe ac heat flux density W, when driving on the 96th\nresonance close to 2.08 K. For small W we did not observe\nany subharmonic generation at all [7]. Then, above a\ncritical flux Wc, ELF rose rapidly, suggesting that the\nphenomenon is of a threshold character. At T \u0002 T\u0002 \u0002\n1:88 K for which \u0002 vanishes [18], no subharmonics were\nobserved, regardless of the magnitude of W, thus confirm-\ning the crucial importance of nonlinearity. For W above\n10:4 mW=cm2, we observed a distortion of the signal\nsimilar to that shown in Fig. 1(c) and the formation of a\nfew subharmonics. Further increase of W above\n20 mW=cm2 led to the generation of multiple subhar-\nmonics. These phenomena appear in the regime where\nthe energy cascade towards the high-frequency domain\n(i.e., direct cascade, with a Kolmogorov-like spectrum\n[7,8]) is already well developed; see also Fig. 4.\nAll the above results correspond to steady-state regimes\nof the wave system. In Fig. 3 we illustrate the transient\nprocesses observed after a steplike shift of the driving\nfrequency from a frequency initially set far from any\nresonance to the 96th resonance frequency for W \u0002\n42:1 mW=cm2, T \u0002 2:08 K. We find that harmonics of\nthe drive in the high-frequency spectral domain are formed\nvery quickly, but that formation of the subharmonics takes\nmuch longer: it took \u00060:5 s here, and can reach several\ntens of seconds under some conditions [19].

A substantial proportion of the\nenergy then flows from the driving frequency !d towards\nthe low-frequency domain !<!d leading to an accumu-\nlation of wave energy there and a corresponding increase in\nwave amplitude. The reduction of wave amplitude seen in\nthe high-frequency spectral domain is indicative of the\nonset of energy backflow towards lower frequencies, i.e.,\na sharing of the flux between the direct and inverse energy\ncascades. The decrease in energy at high frequencies\nwithin 0:397< t < 1:3 s is attributable to relaxation pro-\ncesses in the direct cascade. Redistribution of wave energy\ndue to sharing of the energy flux between the direct and\ninverse cascades starts at t \u0002 1:3 s. Note that the transient\nevolution shown in Figs. 3 and 4 is incomplete. The for-\nward and inverse energy fluxes are still changing at t \u0002\n2 s, leading us to anticipate further relaxation oscillations\nat longer times (inaccessible with our present equipment):\nthe transient dynamics is clearly complex, and a full char-\nacterization will require further work. Absorption of wave\nenergy at low frequencies is probably attributable to vis-\ncous drag of the normal fluid component on the resonator\nwalls, given that bulk second sound damping is negligibly\nsmall in this frequency range: this would be consistent with\nthe observed strong decrease of the resonator Q factor\nbelow 3 kHz. We observe hysteresis between increasing\nand decreasing frequency scans (bars on data points in\nFig. 5). Its width, i.e., the region where the low-frequency\nsound waves are metastable, was less than the viscous\nwidth of the resonance.\nTo seek a more detailed understanding of wave energy\ntransformation in acoustic turbulence, we used a technique\n[19] for direct numerical integration of the 2-fluid thermo-\nhydrodynamical equations [17], expanded up to quadratic\nterms in the wave amplitude. It represents the second sound\nwaves in terms of Hamiltonian variables [7,20], as in ear-\nlier studies [8] of acoustic turbulence. Wave damping was,\nhowever, taken explicitly into account at all frequencies, a\nfeature that is of key importance for a correct description of\nsubharmonic generation. The main results are summarized\nin Fig. 5.\nIt is evident (inset of Fig. 5) that, for sufficiently high\ndriving amplitude W, the wave develops an instability with\nrespect to generation of low-frequency subharmonics of\nthe driving force at !d. For zero detuning from a cavity\nresonance, the onset of the instability occurs at a threshold\nW\t \/ 1=\u0002. If the dimensionless frequency detuning j\u0001j is\nless than a critical value \u0001\t \u0006 1=Q, the instability has a\nsoft character, in that the amplitudes of the low-frequency\nFIG. 5 (color online).

Outside\nthis range, the low-frequency waves are characterized by\nthe hard onset observed experimentally. Measurements\n(squares) are compared with theory (full line) in the main\npart of Fig. 5. The hard onset is accompanied by a finite\njump in subharmonic amplitude. These two regimes of\nbehavior are separated by critical points on the bifurcation\nline. The generation of subharmonics in the nonlinear\noscillatory system found numerically appears to be similar\nto the bifurcation of an anharmonic oscillator [21]. We\nestimated numerically that the critical detuning parameter\n\u0001\t at T \u0002 2:08 K is close to 10\u00014, and that the critical ac\nheat flux density W\t is equal to a few mW=cm2, in good\nagreement with our observations. The experimental results\nshown in Fig. 1 can be understood as corresponding to the\nworking point moving horizontally on the bifurcation dia-\ngram (Fig. 5, inset) into the (yellow) shaded region from a\nposition just outside it, through the hard (blue) instability\nline. Although nonlocal (in ! space) interactions between\nwaves at !d and low-frequency waves probably contribute\nto the subharmonics, due to the finite width of the low-\nfrequency spectral domain, our numerical estimates show\nthat the interactions of high-frequency (! \u000b !d) waves\nwith subharmonics are relatively weak, consistent with our\ninference of two cascades.\nOur experiments have revealed an inverse wave energy\ncascade in a turbulent acoustic system. It is responsible for\na substantial increase in wave amplitude corresponding to\nthe formation of a set of huge low-frequency subhar-\nmonics. This instability develops through formation of\nisolated low-frequency waves of amplitude higher than\nthat typical of waves around them. The latter can be\nconsidered as the acoustic analogue of the giant \u2018\u2018rogue\u2019\u2019\nwaves that occasionally appear on the ocean and endanger\nshipping. Their origin lies in the development of a decay\ninstability of the periodic wave, i.e., a similar mechanism\nto that proposed [12,22] (modulation instability) to account\nfor the creation of oceanic rogue waves [23]. Note that this\nmechanism differs from an alternative explanation pro-\nposed recently [24] that involves scattering of nonlinear\nwaves on a continuous noisy background.\nWe acknowledge valuable discussions with A.
