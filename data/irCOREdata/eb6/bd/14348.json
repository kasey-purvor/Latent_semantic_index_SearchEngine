Allinson\nSchool of Social Sciences and Professional Studies, University of Humberside\nThe provision of CBL within social psychology has been, to date, largely restricted to providing\nintroductory teaching material and event-logging tools. Experiment generators, as exist in the more\nformal domains of cognitive psychology, are required to actively engage students in acquiring practical\nprofessional skills. Here we introduce the concept of Multimedia Experiment Packages (MEPs), which lie\nsomewhere between conventional CBL and free-form experiment generator packages. Two case studies\nare described which offer integrated MEP environments to promote sound research skills.\nIntroduction\nPerhaps surprisingly, psychology has been a discipline eager to capitalize on the application of\ncomputers for teaching. Traditionally, this has been for statistical calculations, and the\npresentation of experimental stimuli and the automatic collection of timed events (e.g., reaction\ntimes, choice-decision times). Here, the traditional capabilities of computers are being\nexploited - namely, their accurate temporal sequencing, graphical performance, and, above all,\ntheir number crunching. As such, they have been powerful and essential tools for those\ninvolved in the more psychophysical or cognitive areas of psychology. Computer-based\nlearning (CBL) remains very much a preserve of these more formal domains. The arrival of\nhypermedia has opened the way for CBL to be exploited within the less formal domains of\npsychology; but the level of interactivity is usually very restricted, and the constrained\npresentational styles means that even this technological progression fails to meet the contextual\nrichness needed in the teaching of much of the behavioural sciences. The advent of multimedia\nhas for the first time provided the potential to explore, within the normal undergraduate\nlearning environment, real behaviour using the observational techniques that form the basic\nmethodology of the practising social psychologist.\nThis paper outlines the needs for Multimedia Experiment Packages (MEPs) in social\npsychology tuition in terms of both their pedagogical and technological requirements. These\n7\nLes\/eyJ. AMnson Social psychology: new directions in computer-based learning\nare illustrated by two case studies of prototype MEPs - one for initial student exposure to\nobservational methods, and the other for the detailed exploration of a complex category system\nfor the microanalysis of conversational dialogue. The current development stage of these\npackages is more akin to traditional open-ended laboratory practicals in their functionality.\nHowever, the aim is to extend the current authoring aspects (now chiefly seen by the tutor) so\nthat the students can incorporate their own material (e.g., edited video and transcripts), develop\ntheir own behavioural classification schemes, and effectively integrate the teaching of research\nmethods with original research of their own.\nMultimedia Experiment Packages for social psychology\nPsychology and the behavioural sciences are \u2014 by their very nature \u2014 empirical. An essential\nfacet of any undergraduate course is the exposure of the students to the design,\nimplementation, and analysis of experiments. Such activities have been traditionally very\nresource-intensive in terms of staff time and expertise, and equipment needs. Computer-based\nexperiment generators are readily available in the formal domains of psychology. Here,\nthe experiment is active in the sense that the experimenter designs and executes all aspects\nof the experiment. In social psychology, the typical approach is to observe human behaviour in\na naturalistic setting. The experiment, or more correctly the non-participant observational\nstudy, can be said to be passive, as the experimenter merely observes what is occurring in\nsome aspect of the everyday world. The scientific observation of complex social behaviour\ndemands adeptness in detailed classification techniques whereby the precise nature of the\nindividual differences in behaviour can be identified and recorded. These passive studies\nrequire a very active engagement in the data-collection process. The intricate and perceptual\nnature of the behavioural classification schemes demands that they are best taught by a guided\nexposure to numerous examples. It is necessary to learn by example rather than through a more\nrigorous approach.\nIt is difficult to organize, for the teaching of these practical skills, a naturalistic exposure to the\nappropriate social behaviour. The behaviour of interest may occur only in specific non-public\ncircumstances or in remote locations. So the apparatus that we have been forced to employ, in\nthe main, is the video-recorder with all the associated ordeals of slow access and poor user-\ncontrol. Even accepting the limitations of carefully edited videos, the acquisition of skills in\nobserving, recording and analysing social situations, interactions and conversations is tutor-\nintensive if these skills are to be mastered at more than a superficial level. Individual, or even\nsmall-group, tuition of observational skills is often no longer economically feasible within the\nrapidly changing realm of higher education. The seamless inclusion of video and sound in an\nintegrated learning environment has made the computer-mediated approach not only viable but\nalso capable of creating an enhanced educational experience tailored to the individual. The\npotential of CBL to promote deep active learning has been extensively reported and discussed\nelsewhere (Laurillard, 1993), as have the requirement to recognize the differing learning styles\nand needs of the individual student (Allinson, 1992).\nCase studies\nThe following two case studies illustrate different aspects of prototype MEPs. The first is\naimed at a wide audience of students, and not only demonstrates the logistical benefits of\n8\nALT-] Volume 4 Number I\ncomputer delivery over traditional means but indicates how experience of experimental\nmethodology, data collection and analysis, and assignment generation may be combined within\na single package. The second is a more advanced, and specialized, topic where the underlying\neducational objective is to provide tools for the deep appreciation of a complex classification\nsystem. In this short paper, the emphasis will be functionality of the packages rather than\ndetailed evaluation findings (which will form the basis of a later paper).\nCase study - Introduction to Observational Methods\nThis MEP was designed to introduce a large number of first-year undergraduates, taking a\nrange of social science courses, to the elements of observational methodology. The concept of\nobserving social behaviour is not new to students; it is an everyday activity for all of us.\nMostly, these observations are unfocused and unintentional. Observations that are conducted as\npart of social science research need to be deliberate, systematic, accurate and record interesting\naspects of behaviour. It is these differences that need to be emphasized to students, and solid\nfoundations laid for further courses - both in appreciating the work of others, and in designing\nand conducting their own research. The example behaviour chosen for this first exposure to\nobservational methodology is based on the collision avoidance behaviour of pedestrians. When\nindividuals approach one another on a collision pathway, a collision will occur unless one or\nboth of the pedestrians take some form of avoidance action. Collett and Marsh (1981) found\nthat while men oriented themselves towards the person they were passing, women tended to\nturn away. Turning in towards a person has been termed an open pass, while turning away has\nbeen termed a closed pass. The example is chosen as it a relatively simple explicit instance of\nnon-verbal behaviour, and can form the basis of further discussion (either in tutorial classes or\nthrough assignments), and the students can be encouraged to observe this activity in their\neveryday environment. This final point is important as it reinforces the relevance of social\nscience studies in attempting to explain previously unnoticed activities.\nThe existing mechanisms for conducting this exercise were the provision of paper\ndocumentation and an edited videotape giving examples of open and closed passes, followed\nby examples which need to be classified. This edited tape was, in fact, produced from over\nthree and half hours of recorded video. The practical difficulties were the logistical ones of\nbooking out one of a small number of tapes, finding a videoplayer, and then struggling with its\npoor operational interface. A computer-based solution overcomes all these constraints on the\nstudent's learning opportunities. The standard integrated Quicktime video controller offers far\ngreater control than that of a videoplayer. The students are more acquainted with manipulating\na computer interface through extensive exposure to other CBL packages than operating a\nunfamiliar videoplayer. Computer use is familiar to students as IT skills are compulsory\nelements for all first-year students at the University of Humberside. The original paper\ndocumentation could not take into account differences between videoplayers; but the MEP\npresents a uniform interface together with the relevant online assistance.\nThe learning package has been deliberately kept simple in its presentational form (see Figure\n1). However, the package provides much more than the previous delivery method - not only is\nbackground information, data-entry and statistical testing integrated, but the relatively small\nnumber of events analysed by the student can be merged with a larger data set, and the results\n(both raw data and results of the statistical tests) can be transferred directly to their assignment\nreports. The original videotape exercise has been presented as both a group activity and as an\nindividual self-learning activity. When conducted as a group exercise, there was poor\n9\nLesleyJ.

This suggests that improved user control is required to ensure the required\nlevel of concentration on the task. The ease of access, selection and manipulation of the video\nprovided by the computer interface, have overcome this problem. The computer-based\napproach, though intended as an individual self-learning activity, does allow students to work\nin ad hoc groups if they wish. As these introductory practicals are integrated into the IT skill\nacquisition programme, for all social science students, this enriched utilization of computers is\nmost appropriate at this time.\nCase study - Microanalysis of Political Interviews\nThe analysis of social interaction has played a significant role in social psychological research;\nand various techniques have been developed in order to further our understanding of this\naspect of social behaviour. The example used in this MEP concerns the detailed structure of\nhow politicians and interviewers relate within the bounds of televised interviews (Allinson and\nBull, 1995). The topic has an inherent general attraction to students; and notwithstanding its\nimportance as an example of social-psychology research, it provides an excellent basis for\npresenting the complex classification schemes that can result from detailed conversation\nanalysis. The analysis of equivocation in political interviews by Bull and Mayer (1993), which\n10\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\nPolitical flnnlysls - r:\nus; f.Mwr\n^ Sgj^d\nDD: What about your attitude to trade unions\nyou've said you're going to give a massive of\npower to trade unions if Labour comes back\nisn't that something again that people are\nfearful of that is going to lose you votes?\nNK: Yes 1 haven't said by the way that we're\ngoing to give massive return of power I've\nnever used such a phrase in my life,\nSimply because the politician responds with a\nyes or no, does not always mean they are giving\na reply.

AJIinson Social psychology, new directions in computer-based learning\nforms the background of this package, specifies a set of criteria for identifying questions,\nreplies and non-replies to questions in political interviews, and a scheme whereby different\ntypes of non-replies could be categorized - to date, 35 different types of non-replies have been\nidentified! This on-going work forms part of a second-year social psychology module at the\nUniversity of York.\nExisting practical classes were very expensive in terms of expert time. With the expert tutor\nable to demonstrate only a few categories of question\/response pairs and provide edited video\nexamples, the practical class was forced to resort to the analysis of audio cassettes (aided by\ntranscripts and guidance notes). It was impossible to provide a classroom of videoplayers. With\nthe provision of computer delivery, the students are now able to engage in more in-depth\nanalysis, one outcome being a much enhanced standard of assessment. Previously, it had not\nproved possible to assess this activity in a meaningful manner.\nThe structure of this hierarchical classification system differs from the intrinsic knowledge\nbase of more conventional hypermedia systems in that the knowledge base is not a generalized\nnetwork of information screens but a well-ordered hierarchy. There is still a need to allow the\nuser to transverse the structure of the classification system in a variety of ways; namely:\n\u2022 Guided tour - Author-prescribed route aimed at presenting an ordered view of the\nclassification scheme\n\u2022 Self-exploration - User selects partial\/complete question\/response types to retrieve a\nspecified subset of examples (see Figure 2)\n\u2022 Self-assessment - User presented with example(s) and required to guess the correct\nquestion\/response type(s)\n\u2022 Categories - User selects question\/response type or a subset via a diagrammatic\nrepresentation of the classification scheme.\nThese differing navigational\/learning modes not only endorse such cognitive principles as\nTulving's encoding specificity - i.e., material is easier to recall if it contains distinctive\nretrieval cues that can be regenerated at the time of recall - and encoding variability - i.e.,\nmultiple exposure to the same material in differing contexts will aid recall - (Tulving and\nThomson, 1973), but there are other educational strengths. For example, access via the\ncategories mode enables the hierarchical nature of the classification scheme to be directly\ndiscernible through its spatial arrangement. The interface is necessarily more complex than in\nthe first case study, but across all the modes it presents as far as possible a uniform\nfunctionality and appearance. The interface can be briefly described in terms of the self-\nexploration mode. The user selects a complete or partial question\/response pair from the\nhierarchical menus. The selection appears in the Question and Response frame, and the number\nof available examples is also indicated. The details of the first example (i.e., participants,\ntranscript, notes and first frame of video) are displayed. The video can be played (any number\nof types). The user can move through the various examples using the Previous clip and Next\nclip buttons. Details are displayed of the user's current position within the example sequence.\nAll data files (e.g., video clips, transcripts, associated notes and classification codings) are\nmaintained separately to the MEP application. This allows the easy replacement or addition of\n12\nVolume 4 Number \/\nmaterial. A number of support tools are available assist in the authoring processes. At present,\nthese are used only by the tutor, but it is intended that more comprehensive tools will be made\navailable to the students so that they can construct their own classification systems for related\ndiscourse activities.\nThis particular application lends itself well to multimedia presentation. Firstly, the\nmicroanalysis of discourse is necessarily an intense activity. The analysis of the discourse from\nwritten transcripts alone is tedious, and it is therefore difficult to motivate students. The\ninclusion of the video jointly with the textual transcript helps to add interest and increase\nmotivation as well as emphasizing the detailed context of the message. The non-verbal aspects\nof voice intonation, phrasing, gesture and facial expression are of immense additional value.\nThe complete package provides direct access to full annotated background papers and\nintroductory material. There are over 60 videoclips, which together with associated transcripts\nand notes, comprise over 130 Megabytes of data. The investment, in terms of the development\neffort, has relieved the tutor from much of the menial work associated with this teaching\nmodule, and has provided tools for easily modifying the content as well as improving the\neducational experience and assessment.\nFuture directions\nThese two case studies illustrate the capacity of current CBL tools for the implementation of\nsocial psychology MEPs. The first study presents a simple system for widespread use among\nnovice social-science students. The aim is to offer a seamless extension from the limited supplied\nexamples of collision events to where students can incorporate their own video recordings. There\nshould be a natural progression from introductory\/training material, through open-ended\npracticals, to open research activity. The second study though exemplifying the strengths of\nmultimedia to provide CBL packages for the study of complex human interactions, has revealed\nthat there is much within the authoring aspects that is still very time-consuming - the transcripts\nhave to be produced manually. The current standing of automatic speech-to-text transcription is\nstill far removed from coping with the subtleties of finely structured conversations. The same can\nbe said about the automatic recognition of bodily and facial gestures. Advances in these areas\nwill come, and will have their initial impact on research but they will feed through into teaching.\nThe boundaries between these currently distinct activities will become less perceptible as\ncomputational power and availability increases. The concept of the MEP introduced in this paper\ngoes some way in providing the generic experiment generator shell for social psychology.\nIncreasing productivity and rising student numbers are often quoted as major factors\ninfluencing the introduction of CBL; but the application of comprehensive multimedia\nimplementations for the teaching of practical social psychology skills can be viewed as an\naugmentation of traditional methods and not merely an imposed substitute. There should be a\nmerging of teaching and research tools, so enabling active learning and furthering the eventual\ngoal of the virtual real-world social psychology laboratory.\nReferences\nAllinson, L.J.
