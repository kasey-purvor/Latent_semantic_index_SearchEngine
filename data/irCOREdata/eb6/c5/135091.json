Benkreira@bradford.ac.uk   \n \nAbstract: This experimental study of dynamic wetting in metering and pre-metered forward roll \ncoating shows that the dimensionless applicator flow rate \uf06cA, is the key parameter as it defines \nwhether dynamic failure occurs by air entrainment (\uf06cA>\uf06cA, trans) or cascade (\uf06cA< \uf06cA, trans).    \uf06cA, trans \nis the flow rate when the regime switches from metering to pre-metered and \uf06cA, min , the minimum \nflow rate in the pre-metered regime.  When Ca was varied in the range 0.2\uf0ae5, \uf06cA, trans and \uf06cA, min \nwere in the range 1.40\uf0ae1.29 and 1.20\uf0ae1.18 respectively.  These values compare very well with \ntheoretical  predictions.  The  air  entrainment  speeds  V\n*\nM  were  found  to  be  similar  to  the \ncorresponding speeds V\n*\nplunging , measured in plunging tape flow but the cascade speeds V\n**\nM can be \nsmaller or larger depending on \uf06cA . This led to exploring hydrodynamic assistance and drawing an \nanalogy with curtain coating, which was supported by the data.  It was also observed that cascade \noccurred in the pre-metered regime because the dynamic wetting line XD, moves near the minimum \ngap position just as in reverse roll coating. Indeed the cascade speeds conform to correlations \ndeveloped for reverse roll coating.  Finally the study gives data on XD, and compares them with \ntheoretical  predictions.    The  agreement  in  this  case  is  only  qualitative  and  this  points  to \ndeficiencies in current modeling of the dynamic wetting region.   \n \nKey words: Air Entrainment, Coating, Dynamic Wetting, Films, Fluid Mechanics, Hydrodynamics.  \n   2 \n1.  INTRODUCTION \nForward roll coating is an important industrial coating operation and a model coating flow much \nresearched theoretically and experimentally (Kistler & Schweizer, 1997). As shown in Figure 1, it \nconsists of an applicator roller rotating at speed VA and supplying a feed film HA to a metering \nnip H0 , and a metering roller driving a substrate at speed VM.  The coated films are the two films, \nwhich form at exit of the nip. These films are not always uniform; outside an operating window, \nthey may be ribbed or entrain air.  Ribbing is associated with surface instabilities, which occur at \nthe separation meniscus where the two films form.  This paper is concerned only with dynamic \nwetting, which occurs upstream at the dynamic wetting line, XD.  It is the failure of dynamic \nwetting that causes air to be entrained either as very fine or very large bubbles. Very fine bubbles \nair entrainment is observed most typically in the plunging tape flow, where above a critical speed, \nV*plunging, the dynamic wetting line changes from a straight line into a vvv-shaped line with tiny \nair bubbles detaching from the tips of the v-segments. This is now a classical observation reported \nfirst by Deryagin & Levi (1964) and later by many researchers including Burley & Kennedy \n(1976), Blake & Ruschak (1979), Gutoff & Kendrick (1982) and Cohu & Benkreira (1998).  The \ndata all show that for smooth substrates and zero wetting angle\n1, V*plunging is controlled essentially \nby viscosity. It is proportional to \uf06d\n -0.67 \uf0ae -0.87 when \uf06d< 0.5 Pa.s and has an upper limit of about 0.1 \nm\/s for fluids of \uf06d \uf0b3 0.5 Pa.s. A typical and often quoted correlation is that due to Gutoff & \nKendrick (1982): \n67 . 0 * 05 . 0 \uf02d \uf03d \uf06d plunging V                   (1.1) \n                                                 \n1 Substrate roughness (Buonoplane, Gutoff  & Rimore, 1986) and non-zero wetting angles (Cohu & Benkreira, \n1998) postpone air entrainment to significantly higher speeds.   3 \nGutoff & Kendrick (1987) and Lee & Liu (1990) found similar air entrainment type and speeds in \nslide and slot coating respectively.  The dynamic wetting regions in these flows are very similar to \nthat in the plunging tape flow and this can explain these results.  Burley (1992) went further and \nargued that the plunging tape air entrainment results are applicable to all coating flows.  An \nexamination of the data of Kistler (1984) shows this is not the case with curtain coating, which \ncan operate 10 times faster before entraining air.   Blake, Clarke & Ruschak (1994) attributed this \ndifference  to  hydrodynamic  effects,  which  in  curtain  coating  assist  wetting  by  pinning  the \ndynamic wetting line. Effectively, the controlling parameter is the characteristic speed Ui of the \nliquid curtain impinging on the wetting line. Both the magnitude and direction of Ui in relation to \nthe wetting line play a part. The experimental data of Yamamura, Suematsu, Kajiwara, & Adachi \n(2000) showed hydrodynamic assistance is greatest or V\n*\n curtain is maximised, when the wetting \nline is located right beneath the impinging curtain. Blake et al. (1994) found that V\n*\ncurtain, max also \ncorrelates with viscosity but to a lesser extent than in the plunging tape flow: \n17 . 0 66 . 0 *\nmax , 46 . 2 \uf02d \uf03d \uf06d i curtain U V                                   (1.2) \nThis agrees with the argument that at critical conditions, the force dragging the wetting line must \njust balance the force pinning it, which equates according to Blake et al. (1994) to: \n19 . 0 81 . 0 *\nmax , 18 . 2 \uf02d \uf03d \uf06d i curtain U V               (1.3) \nThe question is then: is the plunging tape air-entrainment result applicable to forward roll coating \nor is there, under certain feeding conditions, hydrodynamic assistance of wetting?  The answer to \nthis query forms our first objective.   \nThe second form of dynamic failure is the so-called cascade where large bubbles are engulfed in \nthe coated film.  Coyle, Macosko & Scriven (1990) first reported it in reverse roll coating and   4 \nexplained it as the result of the breaking of the dynamic wetting line on the metering roller when \nit is near the minimum gap position, i.e. it is induced by the converging-diverging geometry of the \nnip  between  the  two  rollers,  which  traps  the  wetting  line.    Benkreira  (2001)  confirmed  this \nmechanism by providing data, over a larger range of capillary numbers, on the movement of the \ndynamic wetting line position XD with metering roller speed up to dynamic wetting failure.  The \ncorrelations of Coyle et al. (1990) and Benkreira (2001) for the onset of cascade\n2, expressed in \nterms of the metering capillary number Ca\n**\nM (=\uf06dV\n**\nM\/\uf073) and the applicator capillary numbers \nCaA (=\uf06dVA\/\uf073) and in agreement with one another are respectively: \nCa\n**\nM = 0.43 CaA\n0.54                  (1.4) \nCa\n**\nM = 0.41 CaA\n0.69                  (1.5) \nBenkreira  (2001)  compared  his  cascade  data  with  plunging  tape  air  entrainment  speeds  and \nconcluded that although the two forms of air entrainment are different, the applicator roller in \nreverse  roll  coating  enables  operation  at  higher  metering  roller  speeds,  i.e.  it  provides \nhydrodynamic assistance.   Moreover, he found the data to conform to the above correlations (1.2) \nand (1.3), which describes hydrodynamic assistance in curtain coating albeit that the metering \nroller speeds are much lower.  The second objective is then to assess if this is also the case in \nforward roll coating.    \nThe third and final objective must be to study the mechanism(s) by which dynamic failure occur \nin forward roll coating by monitoring the movement of the dynamic wetting line as the metering \nroller speed is increased for various feed flow conditions.  Is air entrainment by cascade or the \nvvv-type? Does it depend on whether the flow is operated in the metering or pre-metered mode?  \n                                                 \n2 Throughout this text, superscript *refers to v-type air entrainment and ** to cascade.   5 \nBy controlling the inlet feed to the coating gap, forward roll coating can be operated over a range \nof  regimes  as  illustrated  in  Figure  2.  This  goes  from  the  metering  (flooded  feed)\u2013  where \nHA\/H0>>1 (\uf07e10), XD is far upstream and more liquid is delivered to the coater that can actually \npass through the nip to the extreme pre-metered regime (meniscus) \u2013 where HA\/H0 <<1 (\uf07e0.1), \nXD is right inside the nip and all the liquid delivered, QA (=VAHA) passes through the nip.  For the \nflooded feed metering flow situation, Benkreira, Edwards & Wilkinson, (1981a) tested a series of \nfluids of different viscosities over a range of roller speeds, speed ratios and gaps and found QN, \nthe  net  flow  rate  through  the  nip  to  be  constant  and  about  1\/3%  larger  than  the  drag  flow \nQD=1\/2(VA+VM)  H0.  The  actual  measurements  gave  the  dimensionless  net  flow  \uf06cN \n(=QN\/QD)=1.31 with a standard deviation of 0.4%.  Benkreira, Edwards & Wilkinson, (1981b) \nconfirmed this result theoretically using a simple lubrication analysis.  Coyle, Macosko & Scriven \n(1986)  approached  the  analysis  more  rigorously  using  finite  elements  calculations  and  found \nsimilar  results;  \uf06cN  varied  from  1.33  to  1.29  as  the  average  capillary  number  Ca  (=1\/2 \n(VA+VM)\uf06d\/\uf073) was increased from 0.01 to infinity for equal speeds. \uf06cN insensitivity to roll speed \nratio is reflected in that \uf06cN was computed =1.23 for VM\/VA=0 and Ca=\uf0b5.  Neither Benkreira et al. \n(1981) or Coyle et al. (1986) considered dynamic wetting and its failure, which should occur \nabove a certain metering roller speed (their XD \uf0ae-\uf0a5 did not enter in the analysis).  Chen and \nHiggins (1988) were probably the first to quantify how XD\/H0 varies with Ca in forward roll \ncoating with a controlled applicator feed QA, corresponding to a dimensionless feed flow rate \uf06cA \n(=QA\/QD).  By restricting their analysis to no run-back flow (see Figure 2b), they could impose a \nfixed \uf06cA at the inlet boundary.  Then fixing at XD the contact angle and a slip length enables the \ncomputation of the shape of the bead at inlet all the way to the minimum gap position. Their   6 \npredictions however were limited to one value of \uf06cA=1.226 and for equal roller speeds which \ncorresponds to the lubrication approximation solution of the flow with inlet pressure boundary \ncondition,  P\uf0ae0  as  XD\uf0ae-\uf0b5  and  outlet  boundary  conditions,  P=dP\/dX=0  at  the  films  split \nlocation.  For this value of \uf06cA=1.226, they found that increasing the capillary number from 0.02 to \n0.3 moves the wetting lines upstream of the nip from 60H0 to 90H0.  Benjamin (1994) used \nessentially the same approach as Chen & Higgins (1988); he too restricted the analysis to no run-\nback flow but extended it to cases of controlled feed with a range of \uf06cA>1 and <1.  He also \nsubjected the results to a two-dimensional stability test.  He found regular turning points in the \nprediction of XD\/H0 vs. \uf06cA and Ca, which split the solutions into stable and unstable types limited \nby a minimum \uf06cA, min and a maximum \uf06cA, max.  In the high capillary number range of interest to \nforward roll coating (0.1<Ca<10)\n3, the stable coating window was found to be divided into six \nquality windows defined by the number of gyres present in the flow.  The limiting \uf06cA, min and \uf06cA, \nmax and corresponding XD\/Ho min and XD\/Ho max are shown in Figure 4 with the results of our study.  \nFor the range Ca=0.1\uf0ae10, \uf06cA, min =1.21\uf0ae1.18 corresponds to the onset of dynamic failure by \ncascade and \uf06cA, max =1.31\uf0ae1.26 defines the start of a transition regime which leads to metering \nflow.  Carvalho & Scriven (1997) also carried out a finite elements model of the controlled feed \nflow but for the difficult conditions of HA\/H0>1 where both metering and pre-metered flow could \noccur.  They first pointed that some of the \uf06cA values considered by Benjamin (1994) were not \npre-metered, i.e. controlled feed, and interacted with the imposed inflow boundary condition. As \nthere could be interaction between the feed conditions and the coating bead in their case study, \nCarvalho & Scriven (1997) did not impose a velocity profile at the inlet boundary; they used \n                                                 \n3 We are not concerned in this study with the extreme pre-metered meniscus coating regime for which \nCa<0.01, HA\/H0 <<1 and \uf06cA <<1 (see Gaskell et al., 1995).   7 \ninstead the so-called free boundary condition (see Papanastasiou, Malamataris & Ellwood, 1992).  \nThey  were  able  to  obtain  flow  states  that  extended  to  both  metering  and  pre-metered  flow \nsituations.  In particular they gave predictions of how XD\/H0 varies with \uf06cA in these flows and \nestablished that the transition from metering to pre-metered occurred near \uf06cA,  trans =1.33 when \nCa=0.1.  (Note that this \uf06cA, trans is equivalent to Benjamin's (1994) \uf06cA, max). They did not give how \n\uf06cA,  trans varied with Ca but identified \uf06cA,  min =1.22 when Ca=0.1 as the minimum value below \nwhich two-dimensional steady states do not exist.  This corresponds to the onset of cascade and is \nidentical to the value found by Benjamin (1994) for the same Ca. At this condition, they found as \nBenjamin (1994) did, the dynamic wetting line positioned very near the minimum gap, i.e. XD\uf07e0. \nThe theoretical results of Chen & Higgins (1988), Benjamin (1994) and Carvalho & Scriven \n(1997) form a useful indicator of how the flow may behave in controlled feed situation and at the \ntransition metering \/ pre-metered, they are not however backed by experimental data.  All the \nthree analyses make assumptions on the contact angle \uf071D and the slip length, cannot account for \nnon-hydrodynamic  molecular  effects  and  inherently  disregard  the  vvv-type  mode  of  dynamic \nfailure, which a-priori should occur under certain operating conditions (when \uf071D\uf0ae180\n0). Also \nCarvalho & Scriven (1997) limited their predictions to the one value of Ca=0.1, Chen & Higgins \n(1988) to the one value of \uf06cA=1.226 and some of Benjamin's (1994) predictions were questioned \nby  Carvalho  &  Scriven  (1997).    The  third  and  final  objective  of  this  paper  then  becomes \ncomplementary  to  these  studies:  to  verify  the  theoretical  findings  by  providing  data  on  the \nmovement of XD up to dynamic failure (be it by cascade or vvv-type) as a function of Ca and \uf06cA \nfrom the flooded feed regime, past the transition boundary and into the pre-metered regime with \nboth HA\/H0<1 and >1. It must be noted that the measurement of XD is a very difficult task (see   8 \nBenjamin, 1994) and the development of a reliable technique forms in itself an associated aim of \nthis research.  \n \n2. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP  \nThe pilot coater is described in Figure 3 and consists of a solid steel frame holding two rollers, \none on top of the other, separated by a gap.  The bottom roller (the applicator roller) was made \nout of steel, chrome plated and polished and the top roller (the metering roller) of cast perpex \npolished to give maximum transparency.  The rollers were 19 cm long x 20 cm diameter with \uf0b1 \n0.1 micron surface finish and an eccentricity not varying by more than \uf0b1 5 microns. Inverter \ncontrolled AC geared motors drove the rollers independently via a combination of timing pulleys \nand belts.  Initial calibration of the inverters provided accurate control of the roller speeds (less \nthan 0.1 m\/min).  The applicator roller was immersed in a rectangular trough and a scraper blade \nattached to a vernier metered the liquid film it carried at any speed.  The ensuing film thickness \nwas measured using a needle attached to a micrometer and a CCD camera linked to a PC.  The \nimage of the contact needle-fluid was magnified and the micrometer was turned until the needle \njust touched the surface of the film.  The metering roller was wiped clean and dry by a plastic \nscraper to ensure the formation of a dynamic wetting line. The gaps between the rollers were set \nby placing shims accurate to \uf0b1 0.1 micron between the roller bearing blocks and checked using \nslip gauges.  \nThe onset of vvv-type air entrainment or cascade was depicted visually from above the perspex-\nmetering roller. The dynamic wetting region was observed by illuminating the gap and at a fixed \napplicator roll speed, the metering roll speed was gradually increased until the wetting line broke.  \nIn order to reduce experimental errors, each data point was repeated at least four times. In spite of   9 \nthe  relative  crudeness  of  the  experimental  method,  the  discrepancies  between  individual  and \naveraged speed data were always found to be less than \u00b1 9%.    \nFor the measurement of the dynamic contact line position, XD, we focused directly above the \nperspex metering roller a CCD camera (Pulnix 765TM) coupled with a Canon macro lens (50mm, \n1:3.5)  and  mounted  on  an  accurately  moveable  x-y-z  platform.    The  images  taken  were  fed \ndirectly to  a PC.  The magnification of the images was determined using a photograph of a \ngraticule placed in the nip between the rollers.  The location of the centre axis of the nip as \nviewed from the camera was determined by marking a line on the applicator steel roller and \naligning it at its upper most position.  With both rollers stationary, an image was captured to give \nthe position of the centre line.  With the rollers rotating during the coating experiments, images \nwere collected to measure the position of the wetting line XD with reference to this centre line.   In \nthe actual experiments, the gap, film thickness and applicator speeds were kept constant and the \nmetering roller speeds increased in steps of 5m\/min until air entrainment or cascade occurred. \nThe metering roller speed was then fractionally reduced by about 0.1m\/min below the critical \nspeed. \nDuring  this  experimental  programme,  five  lubricating  oils  of  viscosities  0.030,  0.050, 0.150, \n0.230 and 0.310 Pa.s were tested at gaps of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 and 1.25 mm with the applicator \nroller speeds varying from 5 to 60 m\/min in 5 m\/min steps.  The viscosities of the fluids were \nmeasured  in  a  Brabender  Rheotron  Rheometer  and  found  to  be  Newtonian.    Their  surface \ntensions were measured using the pendent drop method, and found to be 0.035 Nm\n-1 \uf0b1 2%.  For \nthe flooded regime mode of operation, the thickness of the arriving feed films was always much \nlarger than the gap.   In the pre-metered mode of operation, the arriving feed film thickness could \nbe larger, equal or smaller than the gap.  For the purpose of comparison, the air entrainment in   10 \nplunging  tape  flow  was  also  measured  with  the  test  liquids  using  our  laboratory  dip  coater \ndescribed previously (Cohu & Benkreira, 1998). \n \n3.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nAs explained earlier, the critical parameter must be the dimensionless applicator feed flow rate \uf06cA \nwhich describes the flow regime at entry.  In the treatment of the data, inertia and gravity effects \nare ignored and the effects of fluid properties are lumped in the average capillary number Ca as is \ncarried out in theoretical modelling.  The 600 data points for the tested conditions in the range \n1.15<\uf06cA<2.6, 0.1<Ca<5 with 0.6<HA\/H0<1.4 and larger (for the flooded feed regime) are mapped \nin Figure 4 and 5a,b in the guise of \uf06cA=f (Ca) and XD\/H0=f (\uf06cA, Ca) to establish the transition \nmetering  \/  pre-metered  regime  and  assess  dynamic  wetting  and  the  mechanism  leading  to  it \nfailure in both regimes.  These figures serve also as a basis for comparing the data with the \ntheoretical  predictions of Benjamin  (1994), Carvalho & Scriven (1997) and Chen & Higgins \n(1988).  \n3.1 Metering Regime: The reference flow must be the flooded feed metering regime for which \nQA>>QN corresponding to \uf06cA>>1.31 and \uf06cN=1.31, independently of Ca (see above Benkreira et \nal., 1981 and Coyle et al., 1986). In this situation, the measured position of the dynamic wetting \nline was well out of the nip (as shown in Figure 4), the liquid fell back and formed a lip on the \napplicator film and at the critical metering roller speed V*M just prior to air entrainment the \ndynamic wetting line adopted the classical vvv-type shape.  When these V*M are compared with \nV*plunging measured in the plunging tape flow with the same fluids, they are found to be identical \nas shown in Figure 7 (further discussion in section 3.4).  Therefore, the plunging flow describes \nwell dynamic wetting in the flooded forward roll coating regime.    11 \n3.2 Transition Metering \/ Pre-metered: Whilst keeping HA\/H0 not much >1 (typically < 1.40), \nwhen QA was reduced to the point where the liquid did not fall back on the applicator film, a \nrolling bank formed as in Figure 2b; QA=QN and \uf06cA=\uf06cN ; and we were at the transition metering \n\/pre-metered which we measured to be \uf06cA, trans=1.40 \uf0ae1.29 for Ca=0.2 \uf0ae 5 as shown in Figure 4.  \nThis is very close to 1.31, which describes the flooded feed metering system.  That  \uf06cA,  trans \ndecreases slightly with increasing Ca>0.1 is in agreement with both Coyle et al's (1986) and \nBenjamin's (1994) predictions for the metering regime and the transition regime respectively.  \nMore interestingly that a turn down in \uf06cA, trans was predicted by Benjamin's (1994) when Ca\uf0ae0 is \nalso reproduced in our data.  It does suggest that there is a maximum \uf06cA, trans, max .  Considering the \nexperimental difficulties in pinpointing precisely the transition boundary, the agreement between \nthis data and Benjamin's (1994) actual prediction is indeed very good as shown in Figure 4.  It is \nalso remarkable that \uf06cA, trans, max = 1.40 predicted by Benjamin's (1994) is reproduced in our data.  \nAlso, when we compare our data with the prediction of \uf06cA, trans=1.34 at Ca=0.1 given by Carvalho \n& Scriven (1997), the agreement too is excellent.  \nAs for the values of (XD\/H0)trans , they vary very much with Ca and are in the range 80\uf0ae15 when \nCa= 0.1\uf0ae 5.  When we compare our (XD\/H0)trans data with the prediction of (XD\/H0)trans at \uf06cA, \ntrans=1.34 at Ca=0.1 by Carvalho & Scriven (1997), we find their two turning points #2 and #3 \ngive 17 and 13 respectively or an average of 15.  Our data shown in Figure 5b for the lowest Ca \nrange  give  similar  results.    The  important  observation  is  that  just  before  dynamic  failure, \n(XD\/H0)trans still remained located away from the minimum gap position.  This explains why we \nalso observed up to the transition boundary that the dynamic wetting line failed by adopting a   12 \nvvv-type shape prior to air entrainment.  Therefore the plunging flow also describes well dynamic \nwetting in the rolling bank or at the transition metering regime \/ pre-metered regime.  \n3.3 Pre-metered Regime: Whilst keeping HA\/H0 not much >1, we could move past the transition \ncondition into the pre-metered regime by reducing the feed flow QA further corresponding to \n\uf06cA<\uf06cA,  trans.  The  accumulation  (rolling  bank)  we  observed  reduced  in  size  accordingly,  the \nmeniscus no longer bulged out and as the metering roller speed was increased, XD moved right \nnear the minimum gap position until at a critical metering roller speed V\n**\nM the coating bead \nbroke catastrophically, i.e. air was engulfed (cascade) just as observed in reverse roll coating by \nCoyle et al. (1990) and Benkreira (2001).   Indeed a quantitative similarity with reverse roll \ncoating can also be drawn when we correlate the data.  We find with a confidence limit of \uf0b1 12% \nthat: \nCa\n**\nM = (0.63 (HA\/HO)\n1.56)\n CaA\n0.65            (3.1) \nThis is very similar to Equations (1.4) and (1.5) of Coyle et al. (1990) and Benkreira (2001).  \nWe could enter the pre-metered regime directly starting with HA\/H0 <1.  For the range of Ca \ntested we could start from HA\/H0 as low as 0.6.  For these conditions, the meniscus was firmly \nstreamlined with XD in the nip and it too broke catastrophically (cascade) at a critical metering \nroller  speed  V\n**\nM  corresponding  to  a  minimum  flow  rate  \uf06cA,  min.    The  V\n**\nM  data  for  these \nconditions also conform to the analogy with reverse roll coating (Equation 3.1 above).  Therefore \nthe plunging flow is not an appropriate description of dynamic wetting in the pre-metered regime.  \nFigure 4 shows the lowest flow rate \uf06cA, min is in the range 1.2 \uf0ae1.18 when Ca=0.2 \uf0ae 4, exactly \nas predicted by Benjamin (1994) and Carvalho & Scriven (1997).  For the latter we can only \nmake the comparison for the one Ca value given (\uf06cA, min =1.22 when Ca=0.1). Also the turn down   13 \nin \uf06cA, min at Ca~0 leading to meniscus coating, predicted by Benjamin (1994) is reproduced in the \ndata.   \nAs for the values of (XD\/H0)min , the essential information is that they are all equal and close to \nthe zero position as shown in Figure 4, which justifies the onset of cascade.   The actual data gave \n(XD\/H0)min=-5 which sets the experimental error in our measurements.  It must be pointed that the \n(XD\/H0)min=-5 line measured was at a metering speed about 0.1 m\/min less than the critical speed.  \nThe  variation  of    (XD\/H0)  with  Ca  and  \uf06cA  is  given  in  Figure  5a,b  and  compared  with  the \nprediction  of  Benjamin  (1994).    There  is  a  good  qualitative  agreement  in  that  in  the  range \nCa=1\uf0ae10, XD\/H0 varies essentially with \uf06cA only (Figure 5a) whereas in the range Ca=0.5\uf0ae1, \nXD\/H0 varies with both Ca and \uf06cA (Figure 5b).  Quantitatively, there is however a significant \ndiscrepancy between the data and predictions which cannot be attributed to experimental errors \nonly since the XD data at cascade were all located near the expected zero position.   As pointed \nout in the introduction, in the theoretical treatment the dynamic wetting region is difficult to \nhandle and the assumptions made on the contact angle \uf071D, slip length and non-hydrodynamic \neffects will affect the predictions.  \n3.4  On  Air  Entrainment,  Cascade  and  Hydrodynamic assistance:  The observations  made \nabove leads to the conclusion that the critical line for forward roll coating is the transition line \uf06cA, \ntrans \uf0401.40 to 1.29 as Ca is increased from 0.2 to 5.  It divides the dynamic wetting failure from the \nvvv-type when \uf06cA>\uf06cA, trans to the cascade type when \uf06cA<\uf06cA, trans.  Figure 6, which normalizes all \nthe  data  in  the  range  \uf06cA>\uf06cA,  trans  down  to  \uf06cA,  min  reproduces  very  well  this  division.    It  is \ninteresting to note that for a very small range of \uf06cA [1.32-1.39] both air entrainment and cascade   14 \ncan occur, with cascade following air entrainment.  This may be an important observation when \nassessing further the physics of these two types of dynamic failure.   \nFigure  7  shows  that  the  vvv-type  dynamic  failure  speeds  V\n*\nM  measured  in  roll  coating  are \nidentical to those V*plunging measured in plunging tape experiments.  Our first conclusion is that \nthere is no hydrodynamic assistance in roll coating flows when \uf06cA>\uf06cA, trans which corresponds to \noperation in the metering regime up to the metering \/ pre-metered boundary.   \nWhen \uf06cA<\uf06cA, trans , i.e. when dynamic failure occurs by cascade, the corresponding V\n**\nM can be \nlower or higher than V*plunging.  The data plotted in terms of QA vs V\n**\nM as in Figure 8 show a \nsimilarity with curtain coating.  Unlike V*plunging which is constant (depends only on viscosity), \nV\n**\nM depends on QA and increases with it up to a maximum value, V\n**\nM,  max. In other words \nincreasing QA assists wetting up to a maximum speed.  The similarity with curtain coating can be \ntaken further.  When we process the data of V\n**\nM,  max , we find they correlate with operating \nconditions with a confidence limit of \uf0b13 to \uf0b1 1 to % respectively in the form: \nV\n**\nM, max = (0.203 H0\n-1.39 HA\n1.33) VA\n0.81 \uf06d\n-0.19          (3.2a) \nV\n**\nM, max = (0.123 H0\n-1.05 HA\n0.92) VA\n0.66 \uf06d\n-0.17           (3.2b) \nThese correlations are remarkably very similar to Blake et al. (1994) theoretical and experimental \nequations (1.2) and (1.3) above. This confirms the similarity of hydrodynamic assistance in the \ntwo flows. Part of the applicator roll flow is the equivalent of the impinging curtain flow.  In \ncomparison however with curtain coating, V\n**\nM,  max observed in forward roll coating is much \nsmaller. This is because the fluid in the gap splits and turn, the impinging component of the \napplicator roll speed vector is small compared with the curtain speed.  Also the converging-\ndiverging geometry of the nip breaks the continuity in the increase of the contact angle when \nXD\uf0ae0,  resulting  in  the  destabilization  of  the  dynamic  wetting  line  and  the  subsequent  air   15 \nengulfment.  Also in Figure 8, a careful examination of the data shows at V\n**\nM, max corresponding \nto a critical flow rate QA, crit, a further small incremental increase in the flow rate results with a \nswitch back to the vvv-type air entrainment.  Effectively at this turning point, air entrainment and \ncascade occur at the same conditions or V\n**\nM, max = V\n*\nM, max .  When the data corresponding to this \nswitch are picked, they correlate numerically as: \n\uf06c\n*\nA = (QA \/ QD)\n* \uf0ba VA HA \/1\/2 (VA+ V* M, max) H0 =1.27        (3.3) \nTherefore there is only a very small range of \uf06cA[1.27-1.31], where V\n*\nM>V*plunge , i.e. practically \nhydrodynamic assistance is negligible in forward roll coating.  It is however present but, because \nof the converging-diverging geometry, it is prematurely limited by cascade.   \n \n \n4.  CONCLUSIONS \nThis experimental study of forward roll coating has been carried out in the practical range of \nCa=0.2\uf0ae5  and  established  \uf06cA,  trans  ,  the  transition  metering  \/  pre-metered  dimensionless \napplicator flow rate and \uf06cA, min the minimum pre-metered regime dimensionless applicator flow \nrate. Both were found to vary little with Ca and were in the range \uf06cA, trans=1.40\uf0ae1.29 and \uf06cA, \nmin=1.20\uf0ae1.18.  These values compare very well with theoretical predictions. Data from \uf06cA>\uf06cA, \ntrans down to \uf06cA, min were also presented for the variation of the dimensionless dynamic wetting \nline position XD\/H0 with Ca up to the onset of air entrainment or cascade.  The measured XD\/H0 \nagree qualitatively but differ significantly from theoretical predictions and this suggests that the \ncurrent theoretical treatment of the dynamic wetting region in forward roll coating needs re-\nexamining. It was found \uf06cA is the key parameter as it defines the flow regimes and whether \ndynamic failure occurs by air entrainment or cascade.  For \uf06cA\uf0b3\uf06cA, trans , dynamic failure occurs by   16 \nair entrainment similar to plunging tape flow and at identical speeds, which depends on viscosity \nonly. For \uf06cA<\uf06cA, trans, dynamic failure occurs by cascade similar to reverse roll coating.  These \ncascade  speeds  depend  on  \uf06cA  as  well  as  viscosity  and  can  be  smaller  or  larger  than  the \ncorresponding  air  entrainment  plunging  tape  speed.    A  maximum  speed  V\n**\nM,  max  occurs  at \n\uf06cA=1.27 when cascade switches to become air entrainment.  The study draws analogies with \nhydrodynamic assistance in curtain coating and cascade in reverse roll coating both of which are \nsupported by the data.   \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe author acknowledges the financial support of The UK Research Council under EPSRC grant, \nGR\/L96493.
