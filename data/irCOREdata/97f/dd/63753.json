The ACC plays a vital role in communicating\nwater masses between the three major ocean basins, as well as controlling the oceanic\npoleward heat flux in the Southern Hemisphere. The primary mechanisms for heat trans-\nport in the surface waters are eddy heat flux and ageostrophic Ekman transport, since\nthere is no mean geostrophic flow across the circumpolar streamlines that pass through\nDrake Passage. It follows that eddy dynamics in the Southern Ocean are critical to climate\nprediction, a fundamental problem for the current generation of climate models.\nSatellite observations of eddy activity in the Southern Ocean indicate the presence of a\nsignificant peak in eddy kinetic energy (EKE) during 2000-02. Meredith and Hogg (2006)\nshowed that this EKE peak lags a peak in the strength of circumpolar westerly winds\n(characterised by the Southern Annular Mode, SAM; Thompson and Solomon, 2002)\nby approximately two years. Given the dominant role of wind forcing in the Southern\nOcean, wind appears to be the most likely energy source for the anomalously large EKE.\nMeredith and Hogg (2006) tested this hypothesis with an eddy resolving quasigeostrophic\n(QG) model of the ACC and demonstrated that a lag between wind stress forcing and\nEKE is likely if the system is in an \u201ceddy saturated\u201d state (see below for details). The\nlag is due to feedbacks between the mean flow, its stability and the eddies which result\nfrom instability (see also Hogg and Blundell, 2006).\nThere are several possible implications which can be derived from the results of Mered-\nith and Hogg (2006). First, when EKE is high, it appears likely that polewards ocean\neddy heat flux will be enhanced. Second, observational records indicate that wind stress\nthat forces the ACC is increasing (Thompson and Solomon, 2002), implying that EKE in\nthe Southern Ocean may be higher now than in the last 30 years. Lastly, the combination\nof these two leads one to postulate that increases in poleward eddy heat flux, driven by\nenhanced wind stress forcing, may be the root cause of observed warming in the Southern\nOcean. Gille (2002) demonstrated that this warming is occurring from around 800\u20131100m\ndepth; furthermore a recent extension to this work has shown that the warming extends\nhigher in the water column, reaching to the near-surface layers with undiminished mag-\nnitude (Gille, pers. comm.). These three possibilities are investigated in this paper using\nan eddy resolving numerical model and prescribed wind stress forcing.\nA number of recent modelling studies have investigated the Southern Ocean response\nto variable wind stress forcing, including the sea surface temperature (SST) evolution\nand possible coupled effects. For example, there have been several attempts to explain\nthe observations of the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave as a coupled feedback between wind\nstress variability and the SST response (via ocean transport) (Qiu and Jin, 1997; Baines\nand Cai, 2000). Most recently, Maze et al. (2006) used an idealised numerical model to\nexamine this issue, concluding that the meridional heat flux due to the Ekman transport\nresponse to wind perturbations may sustain a coupled interaction.\nGnanadesikan and Hallberg (2000) used a coarse resolution (3.75\u25e6 \u00d7 4.5\u25e6) oceanic\ngeneral circulation model to investigate the oceanic response to enhanced wind stress, and\n2\nobserved a strong northward Ekman response which led to a centennial response in the\nACC transport through stratification changes. The enhanced northward Ekman response\nwas also observed by Oke and England (2004), who used the Bryan-Cox ocean circulation\nmodel with 1.8\u25e6 \u00d7 3.6\u25e6 resolution to determine the response of the ACC to a southward\nshift in the westerly winds. They found that the ACC migrates to the south with the wind,\nand that the SST evolution is dominated by increased northward Ekman transport. The\nEkman response is consistent with several other studies, including Fyfe and Saenko (2005)\nand Saenko et al. (2005), who used global coupled climate models (at 1.85\u25e6 resolution)\nto predict that the wind stress over the Southern Ocean will both strengthen and shift\nsouthwards in response to greenhouse gas forcing. The ocean circulation in these models\nresponds in a linear fashion with a stronger, narrower and more southerly ACC. This\nlinear response is exactly what can be expected from the residual-mean theory of the ACC\n(Marshall and Radko, 2003). Changes in wind stress may also affect the Ekman transport\nand pumping (Saenko et al., 2005; Sen Gupta and England, 2006), which provides a\nmechanism to alter the meridional overturning circulation in the region, thereby changing\nSSTs.\nFyfe et al. (2007) incorporate the poleward eddy heat flux into the turbulent pa-\nrameterisation scheme of a coarse resolution coupled climate model, and demonstrate\nthe possibility that enhanced mesoscale activity may increase heat flux. However their\nparameterisation, which involves increasing the (otherwise constant) turbulent diffusion\ncoefficient, is relatively crude, and cannot effectively reproduce the lag in eddy response\nobserved by Meredith and Hogg (2006).\nThere are a number of studies predicting that the response of the ACC to wind stress\nforcing is not linear. Straub (1993) proposed that, provided the wind stress was suffi-\nciently strong, changes in wind stress would not alter the transport. Instead, transport\nshould be controlled by stratification. This behaviour is observed in a number of different\neddy-resolving models (including Hallberg and Gnanadesikan, 2001; Hogg and Blundell,\n2006; Meredith and Hogg, 2006), suggesting that the dynamics of eddies, which are not\nnecessarily well-represented by eddy closure schemes, may need to be explicitly modelled\nto gain an accurate response. However, these eddy-resolving models are adiabatic in the\nsense that they specify the stratification, meaning that eddies cannot interact with the\nstratification, and thus will miss the thermodynamic effect on ACC transport proposed\nby Gnanadesikan and Hallberg (2000). This diabatic interaction is identified as being\ncritical in the residual-mean solution of Marshall and Radko (2003).\nHallberg and Gnanadesikan (2006) address this issue by modelling the ACC using\nthe Hallberg Isopycnic Model (HIM) at a range of resolutions from coarse (2\u25e6) to eddy-\npermitting (1\/6\u25e6). The latter case can simulate the diabatic flow as well as the eddy\ndynamics, and results from this model are closer to the eddy saturated state predicted\nby adiabatic, eddy-resolving models. This result implies that current coarse-resolution\nclimate models may not be able to accurately simulate the oceanic response to wind\nstress changes.\nThere is currently no clear consensus in the ocean modelling community as to whether\nthe ACC can be adequately described by coarse resolution models with a diffusive eddy\nparameterisation. However, the observational record (Meredith et al., 2004; Meredith\nand Hogg, 2006) indicates that the real ACC shows only a small change in transport in\nresponse to changing winds (maximum 5% on interannual timescales; less than this on\n3\nlonger timescales), while EKE changes are spatially variable but generally larger than\ntransport changes. Thus, there is sufficient motivation to extend the results of Meredith\nand Hogg (2006) to determine the response of an eddy-resolving adiabatic ocean model\nto changes in wind stress. We do this using Q-GCM, a quasigeostrophic model with an\nactive mixed layer, allowing simulation of the SST and heat flux response to wind stress\nchanges. We compare the Ekman transport heat flux with the poleward eddy heat flux\nto assess the relative impacts of these effects, and monitor the integrated SST field as a\nfunction of wind stress changes.\n2 Model\nWe use the ocean component of the Quasi-Geostrophic Coupled Model (Q-GCM, version\n1.3.1). The basic architecture and dynamics of the model are outlined in Hogg and\nBlundell (2006); see Hogg et al. (2003a,b) for a detailed account of the full coupled model.\nIn this model, three QG ocean layers are employed. There are three principal reasons\nfor choosing a three-layer model. Firstly we (and other modellers) have observed that two-\nlayer models inhibit eddy production via the baroclinic instability mechanism. Secondly\na three-layer model is the simplest that will capture modal interactions correctly (see\nDewar and Morrris, 2000, who explicitly advocate the use of three-layer models). Thirdly,\nMaharaj et al. (2007) have shown that, at least in the South Pacific, two baroclinic modes\nsuffice to explain almost all the observed variability of sea-surface height. They see hardly\nany third mode, which would in any case be very poorly resolved on the 10km grid used\nin this study.\nThe QG equations are written in terms of the potential vorticity, q,\nf0q\u2212 f0\u03b2(y \u2212 y0) = \u22072Hp\u2212 f 20Ap + f0D\u02dc, (1)\nand evolves as\nqt =\n1\nf0\nJ(q,p) + Be +\nA2\nf0\n\u22074Hp\u2212\nA4\nf0\n\u22076Hp, (2)\nwhere p is a three element dynamic pressure vector (one element for each layer), f0 is the\nCoriolis parameter at central latitude (where y = y0), \u03b2 is the (assumed constant) merid-\nional gradient of f0, A2 and A4 are the Laplacian and biharmonic viscosity coefficients\nand D\u02dc is the dynamic topography. There are two matrices in these equations: A, which\ndefines the relation between interface displacement and layer pressures,\nA =\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8f0\n1\nH1g\u20321\n\u22121\nH1g\u20321\n0\n\u22121\nH2g\u20321\n1\nH2\n(\n1\ng\u20322\n+ 1\ng\u20321\n)\n\u22121\nH2g\u20322\n0 \u22121\nH3g\u20322\n1\nH3g\u20322\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fb , (3)\nand B, a 3 \u00d7 4 matrix which defines the forcing on the top and bottom of each layer,\nB = f0\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 1H1 \u22121H1 0 00 1\nH2\n\u22121\nH2\n0\n0 0 1\nH3\n\u22121\nH3\n\uf8f9\uf8fb , (4)\n4\nwhere Hk is the unperturbed thickness of layer k and g\n\u2032\nk the reduced gravity between\nlayers k and k + 1, with k increasing downwards. In addition, there is the forcing vector\ne which is given by\ne =\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\nwek\n0\n0\n\u03b4ek\n2|f0|\u22072Hp3\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb . (5)\nHere wek is the Ekman velocity (proportional to the wind stress curl) and the forcing also\nincludes a linear drag on the bottom layer.\nThe boundary conditions in the model are applied to the pressure field. The east and\nwest boundaries are periodic, and pressure on the zonal boundaries is given by mass and\nmomentum constraints, after McWilliams (1977). Boundary conditions are also required\nfor the derivatives of pressure on all solid boundaries, and we use a mixed condition, fol-\nlowing Haidvogel et al. (1992), with a nondimensional coefficient, \u03b1bc, set to approximate\nno-slip boundary conditions. Again, the east and west boundaries are periodic, so that\nthe ocean forms a channel, mimicking the Southern Ocean.\nThe model includes a rudimentary mixed layer of uniform depth Hm with varying\ntemperature Tm. The mixed layer was designed to allow coupling between the ocean\nand atmosphere components for the coupled model, but in this case is used to track the\nevolution of SST as a function of time. This temperature evolution is calculated as\nTmt = \u2212umTmx \u2212 vmTmy + K2\u22072HTm \u2212 K4\u22074HTm +\nF\n\u03c1CpHm\n, (6)\nwhere (um, vm) is the mixed layer velocity, and the mixed layer heat flux is given by\nF (y) = F0(y \u2212 y0)\/Y and is steady for these experiments. K2 and K4 are respectively\nLaplacian and biharmonic SST diffusion coefficients; the latter is employed purely for\nnumerical stability. The mixed layer boundary conditions are zero heat flux on the south-\nern boundary and constant temperature conditions on the northern boundary. Note that\nthese equations are a reduced form of the equations used in the full coupled version of\nQ-GCM (Hogg et al., 2003b); the mixed layer thus allows variation in the horizontal\ntransport of heat, but does not adjust to increase flux to the atmosphere in the way that\na fully coupled model will, nor does it allow vertical exchange with the ocean below.\nThe model is configured to match conditions in the Southern Ocean as closely as\npossible, given the idealised nature of this study. Therefore, while we are unable to\ninclude the shape of the coastlines along the Southern Ocean, we prescribe topography,\nderived from actual topography. The topography is obtained by averaging onto the model\ngrid the ETOPO2 dataset (U.S. Department of Commerce 2001), which for the latitude\nrange we consider is essentially the data of Smith and Sandwell (1997). Topographic\nvariation greater than O(Ro\u00d7H3) \u223c 900m, where Ro is the Rossby number, violates the\nQG assumptions, so we truncate the topography, replacing extreme values by plateaus or\nflat-bottomed abyssal regions. The final topography is shown in Fig. 1(a).\nThe Ekman velocity in (5) is prescribed using\nwek = w0 sin\n(\n2piy\nY\n)\n.\nThe maximum dynamical wind stress (i.e. stress divided by density) corresponding to the\nmaximum Ekman velocity in the steady case (w0 = 1.25\u00d7 10\u22126 m\/s) is \u03c4x \u2248 1.4\u00d7 10\u22124\n5\nParameters Value Description\nf0 \u2212 1.2\u00d7 10\u22124 s\u22121 Mean Coriolis parameter\n\u03b2 1.3\u00d7 10\u221211 (ms)\u22121 Coriolis parameter gradient\nX \u00d7 Y 23040\u00d7 3000 km Domain Size\n\u2206x 10 km Horizontal grid spacing\n\u2206t 15 min Timestep\n\u03c1 1000 kg\/m3 Density\nCp 4000 J\/kg\/K Specific heat capacity\n\u03b1bc 5 Mixed boundary condition coefficient\nHk (300, 1100, 2600) m Layer thicknesses\nHm 100 m Mixed layer thickness\ng\u2032k (0.050, 0.025) m\/s\n2 Reduced gravity\n\u03b4ek 2 m Bottom Ekman layer thickness\nA2 0 m\n2\/s Laplacian viscosity coefficient\nA4 3.0\u00d7 1010 m4\/s Biharmonic viscosity coefficient\nK2 0 m\n2\/s Laplacian SST coefficient\nK4 1.0\u00d7 1011 m4\/s Biharmonic SST coefficient\nw0 1.25\u00d7 10\u22126 m\/s Amplitude of maximum Ekman velocity\nF0 40 W\/m\n2 Amplitude of heat flux forcing\n(43, 26) km Baroclinic Rossby radii\n250 days Spindown timescale due to bottom drag\n3.7 days Viscous eddy damping timescale\nTable 1: Standard parameter list for simulations, separated into fixed parameters, those varied\nin experiments described here and derived parameters.\nm2\/s2 in the central latitudes which is close to observed values (for example, the SOC\nclimatology of Josey et al., 2002, gives a zonal average of \u03c4x = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 m2\/s2 for the\nSouthern Ocean).\nTable 1 shows the standard parameter values for the simulations. The parameters\nare designed to match Southern Ocean values as far as possible \u2013 however we note that\nour Rossby radii are larger than generally accepted values for the Southern Ocean (see\nHoury et al., 1987), a common practice in such models. Moreover, the optimal values\nfor viscosity coefficients are unclear \u2013 we use low viscosity under the assumption that the\nlowest viscosity simulations (with an active eddy field) are the closest approximation to\nreality.\nThere are two different sets of experiments. In the first, the model is spun up from\nrest to a statistically steady state, and winds are then temporally perturbed according\nto a half-cosine for two years \u2013 these experiments are referred to as the perturbation\nexperiments. This is designed to replicate the 1998-99 peak in wind stress, and uses the\nsame forcing fields as Meredith and Hogg (2006) (see Fig. 2a). The model is then run\nfor a further 8 years with steady forcing to determine delayed effects to the perturbation.\nTwo cases are run \u2013 one with a perturbation similar to observed (the standard case) and\none with a larger (double) perturbation. An ensemble of 12 simulations is performed\nfor each case to minimise the signal from internal variability. The starting condition of\n6\nthe ensemble members is determined by snapshots from the 120 year steady simulation,\nspaced 10 years apart.\nThe second group of experiments are referred to as the climatological experiments.\nThese involve 30 year simulations \u2013 of which the first 26 years have variable wind stress\nmagnitude, and the last 4 years are steady. Four cases are run here \u2013 a steady reference\ncase, a case with a linear trend matching observations, a case with just the interannual\nvariability but no trend, and a \u2019total\u2019 case which is forced by both the trend and the\ninterannual variability. Four ensemble simulations are performed for each case.\n3 Results: Perturbation experiments\n3.1 Mean flow\nThe mean state of the standard configuration for this model is shown in Fig. 1 (b\u2013d). The\nmean SST field (Fig. 1b) shows a difference of 14\u25e6C across the channel, with temperature\ngradients smaller in the southern half of the domain. Multiple jets can be identified in\nthe mean field. The total temperature difference, weaker gradients in the south of the\ndomain and multiple jets are all consistent with observations of the mean state of the\nACC (Rintoul et al., 2001).\nMultiple jets can be more easily identified in the mean upper layer streamfunction\n(Fig. 1c). Here we see that the jets appear to be largely constrained by topography, and\nthat 1, 2 or 3 jets may be present at any given longitude. In addition to the jets there are a\nnumber of standing eddies which can extend to the lower layer (Fig. 1d). These standing\neddies play an important role in the dynamical balance of the ACC (Wolff et al., 1991) and\nare also topographically constrained. The total circulation of 185 Sv is 30-40% greater\nthan observed. This transport is a strong function of stratification imposed in the model\nbut, given the omission of full-depth topography in this model, this can be considered\nto be a reasonable mean circulation. Additional simulations, performed with weaker\nstratification (not shown) have reduced circulation in proportion to the stratification. This\nresult confirms the predictions of Straub (1993), that the ACC circulation is proportional\nto stratification; however it must be stressed that stratification in the present simulations\nis imposed, and cannot respond to dynamical forcing, so that one mechanism of response\nto different wind stress forcing is eliminated.\n3.2 Circulation response\nFigure 2 (b\u2013d) shows the domain-averaged response of key quantities to the perturbations\nin wind forcing for an ensemble of 12 simulations, with the ensemble spread for the steady\ncase shown by the grey band representing \u00b1 1 standard deviation. The two perturbation\ncases have been tested for statistical significance (to the 95% confidence level) using\nStudent\u2019s t-test; times at which there are significant differences from the steady case are\ndelineated by a heavy line. There is a clear peak in potential energy (Fig. 2b) which lags\nthe wind stress forcing maximum by less than a year. The peak is statistically significant,\nand exceeds the steady ensemble spread for both cases (albeit for only short periods\nin the perturbed case).

These features are\nconsistent with the results of Meredith and Hogg (2006).\n3.3 SST response\nThe numerical simulations performed here are designed to allow calculation of the tem-\nperature evolution in the channel. SST is averaged over two regions south and north of\nthe ACC to enable a simple timeseries diagnosis of the SST evolution. There are a number\nof ways in which the temperature record may be averaged to produce a timeseries. One\npossible method, mimicking techniques often used for Southern Ocean observations, is to\nuse mean streamlines to define regions, and average temperature over these two regions.\nAn alternative method is to simply average over latitude bands.

Two latitude bands are defined: a region\nsouth of the centre of the domain, between y = 1000km and 1500km, and a region north\nof the centre between y = 1500km and 2000km. These two regions are respectively south\nand north of the central part of the model ACC, although the current passes through\nboth regions due to large meridional deviations (see Fig. 1).\nWe define the temperature difference, \u2206T = Tnorth \u2212 Tsouth, and plot the ensemble\naverage of this quantity as a function of time for the steady, perturbed and double cases\nin Fig. 3(a). The mean value of the temperature difference is relatively small, about 1.5\u25e6C,\nand the ensemble spread of the steady forcing case (grey band) shows the high internal\nvariability. There are differences between the perturbed cases and the steady case, with\na temperature gradient for years 1-6, reduced by 0.1\u25e6C for the perturbed case, and by\n0.2\u25e6C for the double perturbation, but these differences are only statistically significant\nin the double perturbation case.\nThe contribution of the north and south regions to the temperature gradient changes\nare clarified in Fig. 3(b,c) where we plot Tnorth and Tsouth respectively (relative to the\n9\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n(a) \u2206 T (\u00b0C)\n\u22120.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n(b) T\nnorth (\n\u00b0C)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\u22121.4\n\u22121.2\n\u22121\n(c) T\nsouth (\n\u00b0C)\nTime (yrs)\nsteady\nperturbed\ndouble\nFigure 3: Time series of (a) difference in SST between the northern and southern regions;\n(b) SST in the northern region and (c) SST in the southern region from an ensemble of\n12 simulations.

These plots show an initial cooling in both regions\nduring the wind stress event. After the wind stress perturbation, in years 3-6, both regions\nincrease in temperature by 0.2-0.4\u25e6C, and these increases are clearly significant for both\ncases.\nThese results are consistent with the hypothesis that the first response is due to\nenhanced northward Ekman transport of cool water, while the delayed response is due to\nenhanced poleward eddy heat flux which increases the temperature in both regions. We\ntest this hypothesis by explicitly calculating the eddy and Ekman heat flux components\nfor each case below.\n3.4 Heat flux calculations\nThe contributions of eddy and Ekman heat flux to SST changes are diagnosed by inte-\ngrating the heat flux over both the north and south regions defined above. The meridional\neddy heat flux can be calculated by decomposing northward mixed layer velocity and the\n10\nmixed layer temperature into a time-averaged and a perturbation component:\nvm = vm + vm\n\u2032,\nTm = Tm + Tm\n\u2032.\nThe total northwards heat flux across a circumpolar section is then given by\u222e\n\u03c1CpHmvmTm dx =\n\u222e\n\u03c1CpHmvmTm dx+\n\u222e\n\u03c1CpHm\n[\nvm\n\u2032Tm + vmTm\u2032 + vm\u2032Tm\u2032\n]\ndx, (7)\nwhere the first term on the right represents mean advective heat flux and the terms in\nsquare brackets are the perturbation heat flux. Note that we have integrated heat flux\nover the (constant depth) mixed layer, and scaled with heat capacity so that heat flux\nhas units of Watts. In some cases it would be possible to average this equation in time\nonce again, and thereby eliminate the first two terms in the square brackets. In the case\ndescribed here, where the flow is time-dependent and thus not statistically steady, it is\nnot possible to do this. We therefore include all three time-varying terms in our estimate\nof heat flux.\nWe can also decompose the mixed layer velocity into two components,\nvm =\np1x\nf0\n\u2212 \u03c4\nx\nHmf0\n, (8)\nwhere p1 is the layer 1 dynamic pressure and \u03c4\nx the applied wind stress in the zonal\ndirection. The first component here is the geostrophic velocity which will include both\nthe mean and perturbation quantities. We assume that the mean geostrophic flow is pre-\ndominantly due to the large scale circulation, while the perturbation geostrophic velocity\nis used as a proxy for the eddy field. The second mixed layer velocity component is the\nageostrophic flow, which is the Ekman transport in the mixed layer.\nThe ensemble average (a) geostrophic and (b) ageostrophic heat flux anomalies are\nplotted in Fig. 4, averaged over a latitude band which includes both the north and\nsouth regions defined above (i.e. between y = 1000km and 2000km). The eddy heat\nflux has a very significant component of noise, and the signal we observe is smaller in\namplitude than the variation between ensembles, making it difficult to distinguish the\nexcess eddy flux signal in years 3-6. Nonetheless, the anomalous negative heat flux in\nyears 4 and 5 is statistically significant for the double case \u2013 this is a southward flux\nof heat due to horizonal mixing by the eddies (consistent with their growth through\nbaroclinic instability). An average over years 3-6 indicates that the standard and double\nperturbations cause heat flux anomalies of \u2212 1.8\u00d7 1013 and \u2212 3.2\u00d7 1013 W respectively;\nwhen averaged over this time interval the double perturbation case exceeds the ensemble\nstandard deviation of 2.5\u00d7 1013 W.\nThe Ekman heat transport shows a more systematic response, with a well defined\nminimum in the Ekman transport (ageostrophic heat flux) response to the perturbation,\nwhich is directly proportional to the imposed wind forcing anomaly. The negative heat\nflux is consistent with a northward flux of cool water. This effect will act to reduce the\ntemperature gradient and cool the northern region, consistent with the SST response seen\nin Fig. 3 for years 1-2 of the simulation. The average heat flux is of the same magnitude\nas the eddy flux ( \u2212 1.5 \u00d7 1013 and \u2212 3.5 \u00d7 1013 W respectively), but only lasts for\n11\n\u22122.4\n\u22122.2\n\u22122\n\u22121.8\n\u22121.6\n\u22121.4\n\u22121.2\nx 1014 (a) Geostrophic Heat Flux (W)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\u22124\n\u22122\n0\n2\nx 1013 (b) Ageostrophic Advective Heat Flux (W)\nTime (yrs)\nsteady\nperturbed\ndouble\nFigure 4: Time series of (a) geostrophic heat flux, representing eddy heat flux; and\n(b) ageostrophic heat flux, consisting of Ekman transport.

This result is in contrast to numerous coarse resolution\nstudies where Ekman transport dominates the SST response, and may be explained by\nexcessive damping or under-representation of the eddy field in coarse models. In the\npresent model, the eddies outlast the wind perturbation, so have the potential to continue\nheat transfer. The Ekman transport anomalies in the latter stages of the experiment are\npositive, particularly in years 5\u20138. This effect is due to a positive temperature anomaly\n(relative to the mean), rather than increased velocity (i.e. it is the \u2212 (\u03c4x\/Hmf0)T \u2032m term).\nThis is a direct result of warming by poleward eddy heat flux and highlights a specific\nfeature of this analysis; that temperature anomalies are defined relative to a long term\nmean in simulations which are not statistically steady.\nThese results suggest that enhanced winds will reduce the north-south temperature\ngradient in this model, due to subsequent enhanced eddy activity. Ekman flux provides\nan instantaneous cooling while the wind is perturbed, and is a restoring influence once\nwarming has occurred. The poleward eddy heat flux acts to warm both regions, with a lag\nof 2-4 years which is consistent with expectations. However, the signal is very difficult to\n12\ndiscern directly (despite the 12-run ensemble average and domain averaging), because the\nensemble spread is so large. Therefore, even if this effect were present in the real ocean\nit would be almost impossible to see a signal from the satellite record. The perturbation\nexperiments have been repeated for simulations with weaker stratification; results are\nconsistent with the above results, so only one case is shown here.\n4 Results: Climatological experiments\nThe above experiments show how, if the ACC is in an eddy saturated state, then inter-\nannual variability of the wind stress produces an increase in the EKE and poleward eddy\nheat flux, with a lag of several years, which is stronger than Ekman heat flux anomalies.\nIt follows that slower variations in the wind stress field will also modify both EKE and\neddy heat flux, but that the lagged response will play a smaller role. It is pertinent to\nnote that wind stress forcing in the Southern Ocean has undergone a gradual increase\nover the last 30 years (Thompson and Solomon, 2002). We now mimic these trends with\nthe current model to examine the exact nature of this effect.\nWe use monthly wind stress data from the National Centers for Environmental Predic-\ntion reanalysis. NCEP data are available at http:\/\/www.cdc.noaa.gov\/cdc\/reanalysis\/\nreanalysis.shtml. Zonal averages of eastward wind stress were derived from these data,\ndeseasonalised by subtracting monthly means from the respective months and then smoothed\nwith a Butterworth filter with a cutoff at 1 cycle\/year. Data from 26 years from 1976\nto 2002 is separated into two components \u2013 a linear trend, and the interannual variabil-\nity, with 4 years of steady wind after that time. Coefficients for amplification of wind\nstress forcing with time are extracted from this data. Four ensemble experiments of 30\nyears duration are performed. We compare these results with the steady case, and with\na simulation (called total) with both the trend and interannual variability present.\n4.1 Circulation response\nResults from the linear trend forcing and steady case are compared in Fig. 5. Both\nsimulations possess similar levels of internal variability in the potential and kinetic energy\nrecords, and it is notable that the restriction of only four ensemble simulations does not\neliminate this internal variability. The mean value of potential energy differs marginally\nbetween the two cases. On the other hand, EKE is approximately 20% higher for the trend\ncase by the end of the 30 year simulation, which is roughly proportional to the increase\nin wind energy input. The zonal transport changes little between the two cases, and is\neven slightly smaller for the linear trend case during the final years of the simulation.\nSimilar patterns are seen when the simulation with interannual variability is compared\nwith the total forcing in Fig. 6. The interannual variability in the wind forcing sets the\ntiming of variability in the potential and kinetic energy fields, except that the total forcing\ncase responds faster due to a higher mean EKE state (this behaviour is predicted by Hogg\nand Blundell, 2006). By the end of the 30 year simulation, potential energy levels are\nsimilar, while EKE is higher in the total forcing case. Zonal transport is similar in each\ncase. These results are consistent with expectations from previous simulations and imply\nthat we can expect that eddy heat transport may be proportional to wind stress in the\nlonger term.\n13\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n(a) Relative wind stress\nsteady\ntrend\n1.68\n1.7\n1.72\n1.74\nx 106 (b) Potential Energy (J\/m\n2)\n7\n8\n9\nx 104 (c) Kinetic Energy (J\/m\n2)\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n175\n180\n185\n190\n195\n(d) \u03c81 (Sv)\nTime (yrs)\nFigure 5: Timeseries of (a) relative wind stress forcing; (b) domain averaged potential\nenergy; (c) domain averaged kinetic energy and (d) upper layer streamfunction for the\nsteady case, and the case with a linear trend in wind stress. Data is the mean across 4\nensemble simulations.\n4.2 SST response\nThe temperature responses for the four cases are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 using the\nsame definitions for averaging regions as Fig. 3. This data shows that a decrease in\ntemperature difference by 0.1\u25e6C is detectable for the trend and total cases. In addition,\nthe total temperature in each region increases by 0.3\u20130.4 \u25e6C when the interdecadal trend\nis included. The interannual temperature response for the cases which include interannual\nforcing (Fig. 8) is controlled by the forcing variability.\nIn the perturbation experiments shown in section 3 above, the Ekman heat flux acts\nto cool both regions, while the poleward eddy heat flux warms both regions. It therefore\nappears that the SST trends shown here are dominated by eddy heat flux. We aim to\nconfirm this prediction with explicit calculations.\n4.3 Heat Flux Calculations\nWe calculate the thermal forcing due to anomalous Ekman transport and due to eddy\nheat flux as per section 3.c.

Nonetheless, there\nis a clear and systematic difference between the eddy heat fluxes for these two cases in\nthe second half of the simulation. The average difference is \u2212 11.3 \u00d7 1012 W over this\ntime, which is of the right sign to produce the warming trend shown in Fig. 7. However\nit is a factor of 3 smaller than the heat flux anomalies for the perturbation experiments\n\u2013 this is most likely due to the feedback caused by increasing SST during the course of\nthe simulation. The Ekman heat fluxes are not as systematic. Initially, there is a slightly\nnegative Ekman heat flux for cases in which the wind is amplified, consistent with a small\nnorthward enhancement to Ekman transport. In the latter stages of the simulation, this\nsign is reversed. The mean flux anomaly over the second half of this run is 7.7\u00d7 1012 W\nwhich is smaller than the eddy component, and the opposite sign expected from increased\nnorthward Ekman transport (again this effect is due to positive SST anomalies in the\nregion of interest).\nFigure 10 shows that interannual variability plays a strong role in setting the heat\nflux, as described in section 3. However, the differences between the interannual and total\ncases show eddy heat flux differences of \u2212 8.5\u00d7 1012 W, and Ekman heat flux differences\nof over the 6.6 \u00d7 1012 W over the second half of the run. These values are consistent\n15\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n(a) \u2206 T (\u00b0C)\nsteady\ntrend\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n(b) T\nnorth (\n\u00b0C)\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\u22121.4\n\u22121.2\n\u22121\n\u22120.8\n(c) T\nsouth (\n\u00b0C)\nTime (yrs)\nFigure 7: Time series of (a) difference in SST between the northern and southern regions;\n(b) SST in the northern region and (c) SST in the southern region for the steady case,\nand the case with a linear trend in wind stress.

The\nACC follows the wind forcing in that the zonal transport increases in proportion to the\nwind and the current shifts meridionally as the wind does. This is consistent with the\nresidual-mean model of the ACC due to Marshall and Radko (2003), who use an eddy\nclosure scheme to predict a linear dependence of circumpolar transport on wind stress.\nThat model has the advantage that it allows for feedback between the stratification and\neddy activity. On the other hand, other models of the ACC, such as Straub (1993),\npredict that increasing the wind stress doesn\u2019t change the ACC. These models generally\nhave stratification specified, but resolve eddy dynamics.\n16\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n1.5\n(a) \u2206 T (\u00b0C)\ninterann\ntotal\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n(b) T\nnorth (\n\u00b0C)\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\u22121.6\n\u22121.4\n\u22121.2\n\u22121\n\u22120.8\n(c) T\nsouth (\n\u00b0C)\nTime (yrs)\nFigure 8: Time series of (a) difference in SST between the northern and southern regions;\n(b) SST in the northern region and (c) SST in the southern region for the interannual\nvariability case, and the total forcing case. Data is the mean across 4 ensemble simulations.\nThe results described here fall into the latter category, where the zonal circumpolar\ntransport is in the eddy saturated parameter regime. This study does not directly con-\ntribute to the debate on whether the ACC is in an eddy saturated state; however we\nhave shown previously, on the basis of observation data, that the real ACC is very likely\nclose to an eddy saturated state (Meredith et al., 2004; Meredith and Hogg, 2006). We\ntherefore assume the existence of an eddy saturated parameter regime and examine the\nconsequences of that assumption.\nWhen the circumpolar current is eddy saturated there is a clear decrease in the temper-\nature gradient following periods of strong wind stress. Associated with the temperature\ngradient decrease is an initial cooling period due to northward Ekman transport. How-\never, the longer term effect is a warming of SST which is strongest south of the ACC,\nlagging wind stress forcing by several years. These temperature trends are primarily due\nto enhanced poleward eddy heat flux which in turn results from high EKE. The total eddy\nheat flux in this model is greater than the Ekman heat flux by a factor of 2 (but this result\noccurs because eddy effects are longer lived \u2013 instantaneous fluxes are similar in magni-\ntude). This result could not be obtained using a standard diffusive eddy parameterisation\nsuch as those used in coarse resolution ocean and climate models.\n17\n\u22128\n\u22127\n\u22126\n\u22125\n\u22124\nx 1013 (a) Geostrophic Advective Heat Flux (W)\nsteady\ntrend\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n0\n5\n10\n15\nx 1012 (b) Ageostrophic Advective Heat Flux (W)\nTime (yrs)\nFigure 9: Time series of (a) geostrophic heat flux, representing eddy heat flux; and (b)\nageostrophic heat flux, consisting of Ekman transport for the steady case, and the case\nwith a linear trend in wind stress. Data is the mean across 4 ensemble simulations.\nUnder a gradual increase in wind stress forcing over 30 years the temperature gradient\nalso decreases. This is due to the same physical effects, except that the lag is not so\nimportant. The temperature decrease is significant for the parameters used here \u2013 ap-\nproaching 0.5\u25e6C warming over 30 yrs. This rate of warming is similar to that observed in\nthe Southern Ocean, implying that poleward eddy heat flux may play a role in anomalous\nwarming south of the ACC.\nThere are several courses of action which may help resolve the extent to which wind-\nforced eddy heat flux has played a role in anomalous Southern Ocean forcing. Firstly,\nwe might appeal to the satellite record itself, and attempt to directly calculate eddy\nheat flux. However, the simulations performed here demonstrate that the eddy heat flux\nis overwhelmed by internal variability, even over a number of ensemble simulations. It\nfollows that any diagnosis of eddy heat fluxes from satellite obervations (a single realisation\nsampled at lower spatial resolution) will be difficult.\nA second method to determine whether the dynamics seen in this model are active in\nthe real world is to examine correlations between temperature gradients and wind stress\nforcing. The link between an interdecadal increase in wind strength and Southern Ocean\nwarming exists already. However, the mechanism described here has a 3\u20136 year lag in the\nSST response to interannual wind stress forcing variability, which may help to identify a\n18\n\u22129\n\u22128\n\u22127\n\u22126\n\u22125\n\u22124\n\u22123\nx 1013 (a) Geostrophic Advective Heat Flux (W)\ninterann\ntotal\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nx 1013 (b) Ageostrophic Advective Heat Flux (W)\nTime (yrs)\nFigure 10: Time series of (a) geostrophic heat flux, representing eddy heat flux; and (b)\nageostrophic heat flux, consisting of Ekman transport for the interannual variability case,\nand the total forcing case.

This can be achieved by\nexamining the dynamics of eddy resolving models which include realistic diabatic effects\nand evolving stratification. Hallberg and Gnanadesikan (2006) are the first to attempt\nthis. They find that as resolution is increased \u201c. . . the diabatic response to changes in wind\nforcing is substantially attenuated by the action of a vigorous eddy field as suggested by\nthe adiabatic view.\u201d This lends support to the hypothesis that the eddy saturated regime\nis relevant to the Southern Ocean circulation. The results outlined in the current paper\nlend a sense of urgency to resolving this debate with additional modelling studies.\nThere are additional potential ramifications of the results described here to the South-\nern Ocean climate system. Marshall and Connolley (2006) propose that winter SSTs may\nbe altering the strength of the SAM. If true, this could imply coupled feedbacks between\nthe poleward eddy heat flux and the pattern of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). It is\nmost likely that this would take the form of damped decadal oscillations in the coupled\nsystem. Such oscillations would be controlled by the lagged response of the eddy heat flux,\nand the dependence of the SAM on high-latitude SST. This may result in an extension\n19\nof the coupled feedbacks proposed by Sen Gupta and England (2007). These feedbacks\nhelped to sustain variability in the SAM, but it was noted that timescales did not match\nobservations. This mismatch may be reconciled by the inclusion of a realistic delay in the\nsystem due to eddy effects as shown here.\n6 Conclusions\nAn eddy resolving QG model of the Southern Ocean is used to demonstrate that:\n1. Interannual perturbations to the wind stress forcing of the ACC increase SST with\na lag in SST maximum 3\u20136 years after the wind stress maximum;\n2. Poleward eddy heat flux is a larger effect than equatorward Ekman transport;\n3. A slower (30 year) amplifying trend in wind stress acts to warm waters around the\nACC, with heat flux due to eddies exceeding Ekman transport by a factor 3.\nIt is proposed that eddy heat flux due to increasing wind forcing may explain observations\nof enhanced warming of the Southern Ocean.\nReferences\nBaines, P.
