Rapid regional\nwarming has made knowledge of life at locations such as\nShag Rocks (near South Georgia, Southern Ocean)\nparticularly important for a number of reasons. Firstly, this\nis where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and its\nstrongest jet, the Polar Front (PF) reach their most\nnortherly range. Biota at nearby South Georgia are sub-\nAntarctic on land but many typical Antarctic species occur\nin the sea (Barnes et al. 2006a). These most northerly\nbenthos of the Southern Ocean live in shallow (top ~40 m)\nsea temperatures of more than 48C in the summer (Holeton\net al. 2005) yet at deep slope depths (1500 m) temperatures\nrarely exceed 28C. Thus the Antarctic endemics amongst\nthis fauna show the temperature extremes that the current\nfauna can and are living in. This is of particular relevance\nto predicted rises in regional sea temperatures and whether\nmost Antarctic ectotherms will be able to cope (Peck et al.\n2004). Of crucial importance then is how much\ncommonality there is between the slope and shelf faunas\nand whether the shelf fauna is mainly Antarctic, cool\ntemperate or a mixture. Secondly, Shag Rocks are part of\nthe only semi-continuous link (Scotia Arc) between\nAntarctica and northerly continental shelf and slope. They\nrepresent a likely first point within the Southern Ocean,\nwhich temperate species shifting their range southwards\nwould reach. Nearby South Georgia has been the greatest\npoint for arrival and establishment of non-indigenous\nterrestrial species within the Southern Ocean (Frenot et al.\n2005) and was also the location of the first finding of a\nmarine animal non-indigenous to the Southern Ocean\n(Ralph et al. 1976). Thirdly, locations such as Shag Rocks,\nSouth Georgia and the South Orkney Islands are isolated\nbut old and as such provide valuable context to interpreting\nage as a factor in colonisation and richness, for example of\nyoung isolated islands such as Bouvet\u00f8ya or the South\nSandwich Islands (Arntz et al. 2006, Kaiser et al. 2008).\nThe Southern Ocean shelf environment is thought to be\ntypically rich (Brey et al. 1994, Clarke & Johnston 2003)\nwith high levels of endemism (Arntz et al. 1997). A\nhandful of algae are the only known established invaders\n(Clayton et al. 1997, Wienke personal communication\n2007). In places, such as around the West Antarctic\nPeninsula (WAP), Weddell Sea and Ross Sea, the\ncontinental shelf has now been quite well sampled. By\ncomparison, the Antarctic deep sea and especially slope\ndepths are poorly known (Piepenburg et al. 2002, Brandt\net al. 2007) - yet knowledge of the fauna there is very\nimportant. If life has been bulldozed to the shelf edge by\nice sheets during successive glacial maxima (see Thatje\net al. 2005) it is from the slope refugia that fauna could\nmainly recolonize. Deep shelf and slope depths are also\npotentially important refugia for the near future if regional\nwarming of shelf seas (Meredith & King 2005) follows\nrapidly rising air temperatures and aerial CO2 patterns\n(King et al. 2003).\n263\nAntarctic Science 20 (3), 263\u2013270 (2008) & Antarctic Science Ltd 2008 Printed in the UK doi: 10.1017\/S0954102008001089\nThe marine fauna around South Georgia and Shag Rocks\nhas been studied by many expeditions since the later 1800s.\nMost sampling that has been carried out has used corers\n(Piepenburg et al. 2002), photography (Teixido et al. 2002),\nAgassiz and other trawls (e.g. Griffiths et al. 2008). Cryptic\nfauna are likely to be drastically undersampled by all such\nmethods yet may comprise a significant contribution to\nbenthic richness. For example, a recent investigation of\nScotia Arc cryptic bryozoans (Lo\u00b4pez de la Cuadra & Garcia\nGo\u00b4mez 2000) found 29% of shelf species in the Shag\nRocks\/South Georgia were new to the region or to science.\nThe current study investigates levels of cryptofaunal\nrichness, novelty (new species to the area or science) and\ncommonality of taxa at Antarctic shelf and slope depths. It\nis hypothesized that the higher richness on the continental\nshelf compared with the slope is due to undersampling of\nthe latter. That is, that species accumulation curves on the\nshelf and slope will have similar trajectories with sample\nsize (assuming the habitats on the shelf and slope are\notherwise similar). Food is potentially much more abundant\nin the shallows so it is also hypothesized that shelf\nabundance will be much higher.\nFig. 1.

The shelf and slope of this region\nis amongst the northernmost part of the Scotia Arc within the\nPolar Front (Fig. 1). The Antarctic Circumpolar Current\nflows through the mountainous shelf and slope in an ENE\ndirection. Sea surface temperatures at the time of sampling\n(summer - March 2006) were c. 0.88C but typically range\n(year round) from just below -18C to c. 48C (Barnes et al.\n2006b). The continental shelf samples were collected at\n53.578S, 40.918W and the continental slope samples were\nnearby at 53.638S, 40.908W.\nSample and analysis protocol\nBenthic samples were taken on the BIOPEARL JR144 cruise\nof the RRS James Clarke Ross between 203\u2013212 m (shelf)\nand 1496\u20131576 m (slope) depths. Collections were made\non 11 April 2006 by dragging a 2 m wide Agassiz trawl\nfor 15 and 35 minutes at shelf and slope depths resulting in\ntrawl distances of 408 m and 859 m. These trawls yielded\n50 and 8 boulders (comprising 3639 and 2406 cm2 surface\narea) from shelf and slope depths respectively. Thus\nboulders from the shelf were mainly smaller than those on\nthe slope but otherwise similar (e.g. in terms of shape,\nrugosity and mineralogy). The boulders present were\nbriefly examined for delicate fauna and air-dried prior to\nexamination under binocular microscope. Boulders from\nTable II.

All recruits were identified to\nthe lowest taxonomic level possible using original literature\nand help from specialist taxonomists. Species accumulation\ncurves were constructed to assess whether an asymptote\nhad been reached and to compare rates of species\naccumulation at shelf and slope depths. Abundance and\ndensity of recruits were plotted again log transformed area\nand tested for a line of best fit. Where the line of best fit\nwas a significant linear relationship, associated ANOVA\nwas performed. Densities of recruits were compared\nbetween shelf and slope samples using one-way ANOVA,\nhaving established data normality.\nThe number and identity of cheilostome bryozoans present\nin the shelf samples were compared with those previously\nrecorded from Shag Rocks and South Georgia (e.g.\nHayward 1995, Lopez de la Cuadra & Garcia Gomez\n2000, author\u2019s unpublished database). Richness (number of\nspecies) and faunistic similarity between the bryozoans in\nthe region was compared using Bray Curtis index on\nuntransformed data (using the software package\nBiodiversity Pro). The regions used were as recognized in\nprevious biogeographic studies (see Barnes & Griffiths\n2008) and data were from shelf and slope depths combined\nand across habitats.\nResults\nIn just 0.36 m2 and 0.24 m2 area of boulders examined,\nrepresentatives of seven and five phyla and 10 and seven\nclasses were found alive at the time of capture on shelf and\nslope samples respectively (Table I). This study shows that\nat the northernmost edge of the Southern Ocean the\ncontinental slope, as well as the shelf, can be extremely\nrich in cryptofauna across taxonomic levels. Fauna\noccupied 30.2% (range 8\u201367%) of space on shelf\nboulders, significantly more (One way ANOVA, F1 \u00bc 14,\nP, 0.001) than on slope boulders (4.9%, range 2\u201311%).\nBryozoans occupied the most space on 94% of shelf\nboulders and three out of the eight boulders from the\nContinental Slope. Polychaetes dominated space on five of\nthe eight slope boulders, in particular the calcareous tubes\nof serpulids and spirorbids. The Spirorbidae were the most\nabundant family on both shelf and slope boulders, but\ncheilostome and cyclostome bryozoan and octocoral\nfamilies were also highly abundant (Table I). Total\nabundance increased linearly with (log) boulder surface\narea but densities significantly decreased (both r2 . 30%,\nANOVA, F1 . 20, P, 0.01). Standardized for (log) area,\ndensities of cryptofaunal recruits on shelf boulders were\nsurprisingly not significantly different between shelf and\nslope boulders (one-way ANOVA, F1 \u00bc 2.11, P \u00bc 0.15).\nThe shelf and slope trawls caught a wide variety of mega-\nand macrobenthos but boulder dwelling cryptofauna\ndominated both abundance and the total numbers of\nfamilies, genera and species in the samples. Some of the\nphyla (e.g. brachiopods) and classes (e.g. stenolaemate\nbryozoans) represented on the boulder samples were not\notherwise recorded in the trawl samples and the vast\nmajority of the families, genera and species were only\nfound on boulders. Cheilostome bryozoans were highly\ndiverse and the most family, genera and species rich taxon\nin both shelf and slope samples (Tables I & II). Eleven\ngenera of cyclostomes were recognized and determined\nto morphospecies level but even with specialist help these\nspecies could not be identified and many may be new.\nSix of these, Bientalophora, Diaperoecia, Exidmonea,\nFilifascigera, Nevianipora and Oncousoecia have not been\nreported from Shag Rocks, the Scotia Arc or anywhere in\nFig. 2.

All the cheilostomes were also\ndetermined to species level, 53 to named species, six to\nnew species of existing genera and a further one to a new\nspecies of a new genus (Table II). Thus on the shelf 6%\n(3\/49) of the cheilostomes were new species and on the\ndeeper slope boulders 21% (4\/19) of species were new.\nSome of the known species were only known from a single\nspecimen or in the case of Dakariella concinna from a\nsingle fragment of a colony. A third of shelf and half of\nthe slope cheilostome species, which were not new,\nconstituted new northernmost records for Antarctic\nendemics. Some had not been previously recorded within\nthousands of kilometres from Shag Rocks but only\nNotoplites elongatus is the first Southern Ocean record for\na species otherwise known north of the Polar Front. Of all\nthe species identified only 11% (8\/73) were found on both\nshelf and slope boulders. Although percent cover of the\nshelf boulders was typically six times higher, species\ndensity (standardized for [log] area) was not significantly\ndifferent between shelf and slope boulders (one-way\nANOVA, F1 \u00bc 0.04, P \u00bc 0.8). Polychaetes and bryozoan\ncolonies on shelf rocks were just much larger. Species\naccumulation curves revealed neither shelf nor slope faunas\nhad approached asymptote (Fig. 2). By number of boulders\nsampled, slope samples showed a steeper species\naccumulation curve (Fig. 2a) whereas if areas were\ncompared the pattern was the converse (Fig. 2b). Probably\nthe most meaningful method of assessing rates of species\naccumulation was using individual\/colony number, which\nshowed similar rates in the shelf and slope samples (Fig. 2c).\nPreviously 97 cheilostomes were known from the Shag\nRocks\/ South Georgia region (data in Barnes & Griffiths\n2008) but this study increases this to a total of 127\ncheilostomes. The most similar faunas to those at Shag\nRocks\/ South Georgia are other localities in the Scotia Arc,\nthe Antarctic Peninsula and the Ross Sea (Fig. 3).\nInterestingly the South Sandwich Islands, the shelf area\nclosest geographically, have lower levels of similarity. It is\nclear that faunas of the so-called \u2018sub-Antarctic\u2019 islands, at\nleast in the case of the bryozoans, may have little in common.\nDiscussion\nDespite the paucity of samples, the current study has made it\napparent that shelf and slope boulders in the Shag Rocks area\ncan be very rich across multiple taxonomic levels. Despite\nnot being apparent from polar literature to date,\ncryptofauna can dominate the benthos, at least locally, at\nfamily, genus and species levels. A large proportion of\ngenera (e.g. 6 of 11 cyclostome bryozoans) and species\n(e.g. 35 of 60 cheilostome bryozoans) found had not been\nseen in the South Georgia region before, some were new to\nscience and species accumulation curves did not approach\nasymptote. Current estimates of benthic diversity (Clarke &\nJohnston 2003) are clearly still far off if even well studied\nlocations and depths reveal so much novelty with such\nlittle sampling effort. Surprisingly, neither richness nor\nabundance significantly differed between shelf and slope\ndepths, but their faunas and space occupation levels were\nquite different.\nContinental shelf mega- and macrofauna\nThe phyla and classes of animal found on the shelf at Shag\nRocks were similar to assemblages that have been reported\nfrom many Antarctic locations (Arntz et al. 1994, 2005).\nThe fauna was predominantly suspension feeders and their\npredators. Of the species identified, the polychaetes have a\nknown wide distribution (Knight-Jones & Knight-Jones\n1984) whereas the others were mainly Antarctic species.\nShag Rocks and the South Georgia area represent an\nextreme geographic and sea temperature limit for the\nAntarctic fauna but despite this the benthos there is very\nrich. Most of the species (46 of 60 [. 76%]) of\ncheilostome bryozoans, for example, found on Shag Rocks\nshelf boulders are at their northernmost limit. Of all\ncheilostome species ever recorded from the Shag Rocks\/\nSouth Georgia region . 66% are at their northernmost\nlimit (data from the current paper and Barnes & Griffiths\n2008). Short term experimental acclimations have shown\nextreme temperature sensitivity of some Antarctic benthos\n(Peck et al. 2004). This has caused great concern for the\nfuture of Southern Ocean biodiversity. Sea temperatures\nhave been predicted to rise by ~28C, in response to\nregional warming and over the last few decades have\nalready increased (seasonally) by 18C in the\nBellingshausen Sea (Meredith & King 2005). Yet this\nstudy shows that species which occur throughout the\nAntarctic at \u2018normal\u2019 Southern Ocean temperatures are\nextremely rich on a shelf, which rises to . 48C in summer\n(Holeton et al. 2005).\nAnother important aspect of regional warming is that\nsouthern temperate species are likely to alter their range,\nFig. 3.

Data from Barnes & Griffiths (2008).\nSG \u00bc South Georgia.\nCRYPTIC BENTHOS OF SHAG ROCKS 267\nthat is migrate southwards. The shelf of Shag Rocks is one of\nthe more likely places for non-indigenous marine species\n(NIS) to arrive. However only with a good knowledge of\nthe identities of current species present at such locations\nwill the first NIS be detectable. Studies of mega and\nmacrobenthos of the shelf or deeper seabeds often do not\nconsider encrusting fauna as sampling methodology used\nis inappropriate to record it. Most of the taxa reported in\nthe current study are previously known from reports by\nspecialist taxonomists (e.g. Knight Jones & Knight Jones\n1984, Lo\u00b4pez de la Cuadra & Garcia Go\u00b4mez 2000 but see\nArntz et al. 2005). Yet this study reports seven phyla, 10\nclasses and at least 40 families of encrusting benthos from\njust 0.36 m2 of boulder substrate from a single shelf depth\ntrawl. For the size of area sampled this is amongst the\nrichest shallow boulder faunas reported from a sample at\neither polar region (Barnes 2000, Kuklinski et al. 2006) or\nanywhere else in the world (Davidson 2005). The total of\n81 species found on these shelf boulders is greater than\nthe total number of mega and macrobenthos otherwise\nfound in the same trawl (BAS unpublished data). The\ncryptofaunal richness alone compares with the richer total\nmega and macrobenthic species numbers from other polar\nshelf trawl samples (Arntz et al. 1994, 2005, Kro\u00a8ncke 1998).\nBoth Shag Rocks and South Georgia are amongst the\nbetter studied Antarctic localities, the continental shelf the\nmost trawled depth and the cheilostome bryozoans one of\nthe better known groups in Antarctica (Hayward 1995).\nThe proportion of taxa being found at Shag Rocks which\nhave not been previously reported could, therefore, be\nargued as a very conservative measure of how well the\nfauna is known. The most recent shelf collection reported\n29% of the species (Lo\u00b4pez de la Cuadra & Garcia Go\u00b4mez\n2000) unseen there before and the current study found a\nmassive 47% of species new to the area. Although there\nhas been great intensity of study around the Southern\nOcean and many scientific cruises over the last few\ndecades, we do not seem to be close to meaningfully\nestimating levels of Antarctic benthic richness except on\nvery small scales. Recent work at one of the more poorly\nsampled sites Bouvet\u00f8ya, shows some interesting parallels\nand contrasts. In 2003 four benthic samples were taken\nfrom shelf (120\u2013550 m) depths at 54819\u2019\u201354828\u2019S\nlatitudes north and west of the island (see Arntz et al. 2006\nfor more details). Like Shag Rocks the majority of recent\nspecies found had not been reported there before and the\nassemblages were Antarctic species (Arntz et al. 2006). In\ncontrast to Shag Rocks very few of these species were new\nto science and the richness was low, reflecting its youth\nand greater isolation. Whereas the collection of bryozoans\nat Bouvet\u00f8ya enabled a first attempt at assessment of\ngeographic affinities of its fauna, the relation of Shag\nRocks\/South Georgia to other faunas was near unchanged\nby the current collection (Fig. 3 compared with Barnes\n2006 fig. 3). Knowledge of Antarctic slope faunas is\nprobably similar to the levels for poorly studied shelf areas,\nsuch as Bouvet\u00f8ya.\nContinental slope mega- and macrofauna\nAs with the shelf fauna, recruits at 1500 m were nearly all\nsuspension feeders despite being a considerable distance\nfrom the zone of primary productivity (top 200 m). Of the\nbryozoans from the continental slope sample, (4\/19) 21%\nwere new species, which is probably a reasonable proxy of\nrelative levels of sampling and knowledge of greater\ndepths. This is unsurprising as whilst the Antarctic shelf is\ncomparatively well sampled, slope and abyssal faunas are\nstill little known (Arntz et al. 1994, 2005). Contrary to\ncurrent paradigms and previous findings elsewhere (see e.g.\nRowe et al. 1991, Dauvin et al. 1994, Kro\u00a8ncke 1998),\nneither richness nor abundance was lower in the slope than\nthe shelf samples. The number of species recorded from\nthe slope samples in total was lower but obviously sensible\ncomparisons depend on sample size. The problem is there\nare many ways of calculating sample size. By trawl length\nand boulder surface area the shelf was richer, by boulder\nnumber and recruit number slope richness was similar\n(Fig. 2). Of these methods it is considered here that\ncomparison by recruit number (i.e. individual\/colony) is\nprobably the most meaningful.\nThere has been debate about the extent to which\nsuccessive glacial maxima have bulldozed life off the\nAntarctic shelf (grounded ice shelves expanding during ice\nages, see Thatje et al. 2005). Even if fauna had been\ncompletely and simultaneously removed from the shelves\nsurrounding Antarctica, which seems unlikely, the current\nstudy shows that the continental slope can be very rich in\ntaxa and species with potential for resupply. Although only\n12.3% of shelf and slope species were in common in the\ncurrent samples, nearly all the slope species found here\nhave been described from the Antarctic shelf by previous\nstudies (e.g. for spirorbid polychaetes see Knight Jones &\nKnight Jones 1984, and for cheilostome bryozoans see\nHayward 1995). Brey et al. (1996) described the Antarctic\nbenthos as unusually eurybathic but for six species found\non slope boulders at 1500 m to also occur in the Antarctic\nintertidal zone (see e.g. table I in Waller et al. 2006) is\nremarkable. For example, less than 1% of Antarctic\ngastropods and bivalves (renowned as eurybathic) span this\nsame depth range (data from SOMBASE, see Linse et al.\n2006).\nThe current study is the first to the author\u2019s knowledge to\nreport levels of abundance in slope samples matching those\non the shelf in the Southern Ocean. This may be due\nlargely to the cryptofaunal covered, boulder \u2018dropstones\u2019.\nBoulder habitat is probably not that common in\nenvironments below shelf depths so normally space for\ncryptofaunal colonization may be largely just externa (e.g.\nskeletons) of other organisms. The lower levels of food\nDAVID K.A. BARNES268\navailability at slope depths are apparent though by the much\nlower levels of space occupation (on these boulders), so the\naverage colonist size must be smaller. As most of the slope\nspecies in the current study are known from shelf\nenvironments elsewhere, slope cryptofauna may not be too\ndistinct from shelf assemblages. Too little is known of\nslope fauna to judge affinities in the way that can be done\nfor shelf fauna (Fig. 3). Given the concern for the future of\nAntarctic biodiversity, a strong next step should involve\npopulation genetics. Comparisons of individuals of the\nsame species occurring at Shag Rocks shelf and slope\ndepths, or at shelf depths across different Antarctic regions,\ni.e. living in different temperature regimes, would reveal\nlevels of connectivity and thus physiological flexibility.\nHigh southern latitude bryozoans fit island biogeographic\nideas of changing with isolation. The continental shelves of\nislands close to continent margins are approximately six\ntimes more speciose than those more than 2000 km away\n(Fig. 4). Richness levels at Shag Rocks\/South Georgia\nare strongly anomalous to the species-isolation relationship.\nThis area is probably a hotspot for a number of reasons\nprimarily because South Georgia is a large and old island\nwhich used to be much less isolated than today (Livermore\net al. 2007).\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to the crew of the RRS James Clarke Ross and the\nBIOPEARL team for help with sampling and to Peter\nFretwell for the map of the study region.
