Forced-gradient tracer \ntests using chloride were conducted in order to assess ground water flow and storage in a \ndeeply weathered, gneissic rock in southeastern Uganda.  Escherichia coliphage \u03a6X174 was \nalso investigated as a possible tracer of viral transport. Analytical solutions to drawdown \ndata, selected on the basis of the pressure derivative and flow dimension, indicate a bulk \nhydraulic conductivity of 1.2 m\u22c5d-1 and a specific yield of 0.23\u00b10.05. Application of a radial \nadvective-dispersion model with an exponentially decaying source term to the recovered \nconservative tracer, chloride, indicates a dispersivity of 0.8\u00b10.1 m over a distance of 4.15 m. \nBased on the recovery of the chloride tracer, average linear velocity of ground water is 1.6 \nm\u22c5d-1. The bacteriophage tracer was largely unrecovered; adsorption to the weathered \n 2 \ncrystalline rock matrix is inferred and promoted by the low pH (5.7) of site ground water and \nthe bacteriophage\u2019s relatively high isoelectric point (pI = 6.6). This study presents the first \nfield determinations of aquifer storage (specific yield) and dispersivity in weathered \ncrystalline rock in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the limitations of single-site observations, \nthese data provide a starting point for assessing the vulnerability of weathered crystalline \nrock to contamination and estimating quantitatively the impact of climate and abstraction on \nground water levels in this aquifer.   \nKey words: ground water, tracer, bacteriophage, transport, crystalline rocks \n \nIntroduction \nThick regoliths of deeply weathered crystalline rock occur across low-latitude, \ncratonic regions of Africa, Asia and the Americas.  Aquifers which occur in the in situ \nweathered regolith (saprolite) and underlying fissured bedrock (saprock), are the product of \nlong-term geomorphic evolution of the landscape that has occurred through tectonically \ncontrolled cycles of deep weathering and erosion (Taylor and Howard, 1998; 2000).  \nAlthough considerable research in the tropics has focused on the hydrogeological \ncharacteristics of fissured bedrock (e.g., Houston and Lewis, 1988; Howard et al., 1992; Briz-\nKishore, 1993; Mar\u00e9chal et al., 2004), comparatively fewer studies have examined ground \nwater flow and storage in the weathered regolith despite its importance not only as a source \nof water via shallow wells but also as a source of ground water storage to underlying fracture \nsystems (Rushton and Weller, 1985; Taylor and Howard, 2000). \n 3 \nThe weathered regolith and fissured bedrock form an integrated aquifer system that \nunderlies 40% of sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 1). Both aquifers are generally low yielding \n(Bannerman, 1973; Omorinbola, 1984; Owoade, 1993; Chilton and Foster 1995; Taylor and \nHoward 2000) but have a long history of development for low-intensity, handpump \nabstraction. Ground water development has recently intensified in an effort to provide low-\ncost, town water supplies throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the most rapidly urbanizing area in \nthe world (Clark, 1998). Despite the increased density of sewage disposal facilities and other \ncontaminant sources (e.g., refuse dumps) in urban Africa, the susceptibility of boreholes \ndrawing ground water from weathered crystalline aquifers to contamination from point-\nsource pollution remains very poorly understood. Localised contamination of aquifers in \nweathered crystalline rock from fecal sources sewage has been indicated by elevated \nconcentrations of nitrate and thermotolerant coliforms in the discharge of handpumped \nwells and springs (e.g., Barrell and Rowland 1979; Malomo et al. 1990; Taylor and Howard \n1995; Gelinas et al., 1996; Nkotagu, 1996; Miret Gaspa, 2004).   \nCurrent guidelines for wellhead protection zones (e.g. Schmoll et al., 2006) require \nspecific knowledge of aquifer characteristics and, ideally, transport of actual microbial \npathogens (e.g., enteric viruses) by ground water in deeply weathered aquifers. There is also \nno clear understanding of the impact of more intensive ground water abstraction on ground \nwater levels in the aquifer system and, hence, the sustainability of intensive abstraction \n(Taylor et al., 2004a).  Published measurements of several, key hydrogeological properties of \ndeeply weathered crystalline rock in Africa such as storage (e.g. specific yield) and \n 4 \ndispersivity do not exist. The overall objective of this study is, therefore, to improve \nunderstanding of ground water flow and contaminant transport in deeply weathered \ncrystalline rock.  Two forced-gradient tracer tests were conducted over 5-day intervals in \nMarch (1999) and August (2000) in order to derive field-based estimates of key aquifer \ncharacteristics including specific yield and dispersivity, and to assess the transport of \nbacteriophage (\u03a6X174), a proxy for enteric viruses, relative to a conservative (unreactive) \ntracer. \n \nTracer Selection \n \n Chloride was selected as a conservative tracer of solute transport because it is simply \nand reliably analysed in the field, and its unreactive character is well established.  Use of \nchloride also avoided the possibility of significantly affecting the potability of a nearby \npublic water-supply borehole. Bacteriophages have been widely applied as a tracer of viral \ntransport in ground water (e.g., McKay et al. 1993; Bales et al. 1997; Ryan et al., 1999) \nbecause they are non-pathogenic (i.e., it is specific to a host bacteria), are relatively easy to \nculture and assay, and exhibit good survival characteristics. The sensitivity of bacteriophages, \nwhich can be prepared in titres of 108 to 1012  pfu\u22c5ml-1 and detected in concentrations of 1 \npfu\u22c5ml-1, is unmatched by most chemical tracers. Added advantages to the use of \nbacteriophage are that culturing and assaying of the virus do not require sophisticated \nmicrobiological equipment and are inexpensive. In this study, Escherichia coli phage  \u03a6X174 \n 5 \n(NCIMB 10382 \/ ATCC 13706 B6), which is a tail-less, single stranded-DNA bacteriophage \nwith an icosahedral head morphology and a diameter of approximately 27 nm, was selected \nas a potential viral tracer because it is comparable in size to enteric viruses. Rotavirus, for \nexample, is considered to be the most important cause of severe diarrhoea in African \nchildren (Cunliffe et al., 1998). The representivity of bacteriophages as tracers of enteric \nvirus transport is, however, uncertain (Cronin and Pedley, 2002) and is the subject of active \nresearch.  \n \nStudy Site \n \n The tracer test was conducted on the property of the District and Town Water Offices \nof Iganga in southeastern Uganda (Figure 2).  This area is underlain by Precambrian gneisses \nand granites of the Granitic-gneissic complex which extends throughout much of central and \nnorthern Uganda.  A prolonged cycle of deep weathering since the Miocene (Taylor and \nHoward 1998) has produced a thick (>20 m) regolith of in situ weathered rock overlying \nbedrock.  The stratigraphy of the weathered mantle at the test site is determined from drill \ncuttings collected during well construction, and shown in terms of graphical logs of \nweathered lithofacies (Figure 3) proposed by Taylor and Howard (1999a).   \n Below topsoil, reddish-brown clay loam (USDA classification) comprising hydrous \niron and aluminium oxides and kaolinite is succeeded with depth by a coarse-grained \nhorizon of angular quartz fragments. This coarse-grained layer is underlain by brown sandy-\n 6 \nsilt and sandy loam in which the frequency of mineral fragments increases with depth.  \nBelow the water table at ~17 metres below ground level (mbgl), gray and yellowish orange \nloamy sand of bedrock fragments persists to the bedrock surface between 22 and 23mbgl.  \nExamining the lithology of weathered profiles similarly derived from gneissic bedrock, \nTaylor and Howard (1999a) observed bimodal particle-size distributions that, in the saturated \nzone, comprise binary clays (smectite, vermiculite) and kaolinite along with sand-sized \ngrains of quartz and potassic feldspar relatively resistant to weathering. \n The pumping well and injection well were drilled by air-rotary methods using a \nboring diameter of 203 mm.  Both wells partially penetrate the aquifer in the weathered \noverburden.  PVC well screens (ID: 140 mm; slot size: 1.5 mm) and filters of quartz gravel \n(grade: 2 to 6 mm) were installed through 1.5 and 3.0 m intervals of the saturated zone in the \ninjection well and pumping well respectively (Figure 3). In each well, backfilling occurred to \na depth of 2mbgl where a concrete seal and skirting were installed to ground surface.  Well \ndevelopment was achieved by air lifting and a step pumping test.  The study site (Figure 1) is \nsituated on a topographic divide with drainage occurring along very gentle slopes to the west \nand east of the town centre. Iganga Town experiences a humid climate which is \ncharacterised by two rainy seasons occurring around April and September each year. Due, in \npart, to low relief and permeable soils that favour infiltration of rainfall, recharge exceeds \nrunoff and is roughly in the order of 120 mm\u22c5a-1 (Taylor and Howard 1999b).    \n \n \n 7 \nMaterials and Methods  \n \n Bacteriophage \u03a6X174 was grown and assayed in Escherichia coli (NCIMB 12416) \nusing the plaque-forming-unit technique described by Adams (1959). Phage and host \nbacteria were reconstituted from freeze-dried culture. Innoculation of the host culture with \nreconstituted phage produced a phage titre of 108 to 109 pfu\u22c5ml-1.  The precise titre was \ndetermined by serial dilution followed by the phage detection method described by Borrego \net al. (1987).  Ground water samples collected on site prior to the application of tracers \nconfirmed that bacteriophage \u03a6X174 was absent.  Prior to the application of tracers, a pseudo \nsteady-state flow field between the injection and pumping wells was established. Phage and \naqueous chloride (0.54 kg) were injected directly into the observation well through a 20 m \nlength of HDPE tubing (OD:25 mm), perforated (slot diameter: 5 mm) over a 0.5 m interval \nat its base.  The tracers were mixed with the well volume using the emplaced HDPE tubing.  \nPhysico-chemical measurements and samples for tracer analysis were taken every 2 hours \nover each 5-day test.  Aqueous samples for bacteriophage analysis were collected in sterile \nglass universals, fixed with 1 to 2 ml of chloroform, placed in dark, cold storage (<10\u00b0C), and \nanalysed within 48 hours. Analysis of chloride in ground water was conducted by \ncolorimetry at the Water Resource Management Department in Entebbe.   \n To monitor tracer migration and dispersion from the injection well, samples for \nchloride and phage analysis were obtained directly from the injection well using disposable \nbailers at regular intervals. The inactivation rate of phage \u03a6X174 in site ground water was \n 8 \ndetermined by inoculating 1L ground water samples with 1mL of a tite of phage \u03a6X174 (6 x \n108 pfu\u00b7ml-1) and storing these samples at 25\u00b0C, the in situ temperature of ground water.  \nOver a 5-day period, 10 ml samples were then taken from the infected water, fixed with \nchloroform and refrigerated (~4\u00b0C) before assaying.  The effect of salinity and hence \nsimultaneous application of phage and NaCl tracers on the inactivation rate of phage \u03a6X174 \nwere also investigated. \n \nResults and Discussion \n \nhydraulic response to pumping \n \n For each forced-gradient tracer test, drawdown (s), the derivative of drawdown with \nrespect to the natural logarithm of time (ds\/d ln t), and flow dimension (n) are plotted versus \nelapsed time on logarithmic axes in Figure 4. The log-log plot of ds\/d ln t versus time, also \nknown as the \u201cpressure derivative\u201d (Spane and Wurstner, 1993), is a diagnostic tool for \nconstant-rate pumping tests that provides insight into the ground water flow conditions such \nas the establishment of radial flow and presence of flow boundaries, that operate during the \ntest interval (Walker and Roberts, 2003; Renard, 2005; Tindimugaya, 2007). Analysis of flow \ndimension (n) is based on the generalized radial flow approach of Barker (1988) in which the \nrelationship between cross-sectional area of flow (A(r)) and distance (r) from the pumping \n 9 \nborehole is governed by equation 1 wherein \u03b1n (eq. 2) is the surface area of a unit sphere in n \ndimensions, \u0393 is the gamma function, and b is the extent (thickness) of the flow zone. \n \n1)( \u2212\u22c5= nn rrA \u03b1      (eq. 1) \n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\u0393\n\u22c5= \u2212\n2\n2 23\nn\nb\nn\nn\nn\n\u03c0\u03b1      (eq. 2) \n \nThe flow dimension (n) defines the rate at which cross-sectional flow area changes with \nrespect to distance from the pumping well. Both the pressure derivative and flow dimension \nwere used to constrain the range of potential conceptual models of the tested system and, \nhence, analytical solutions to be applied to the drawdown response and transport of applied \ntracers.  \n Brief changes in the pumping regime which occurred during each tracer test are \ndetectable in both plots of the drawdown response in Figure 4. In 1999, the pumping rate (Q) \nwas increased from 0.8 to 1.0 m3\u22c5hr-1 after 72 hours. As a result, the applied hydraulic \ngradient between the injection and pumping wells increased slightly from -0.066 to -0.086. \nIn 2000, the pumping rate remained fairly constant between 1.7 and 2.0 m3\u22c5hr-1 throughout \nthe test but was interrupted by a temporary cessation of pumping after 21 hours. Apart from \nthis interruption, the hydraulic gradient applied over the entire test ranged from -0.089 to -\n0.094. \n 10 \nThe response of the aquifer to pumping during both tests suggests that it is \nunconfined. During the 1999 tracer test (Figure 4a), stabilization of drawdown between 4 \nand 24 hours of pumping is followed by a small but steady increase in drawdown. The \nformer, indicated by negative deflections in the pressure derivative, reflects the contribution \nof depression storage whereas the latter, supported by a generally constant derivative \ndrawdown between 24 and 72 hours, suggests that gravity storage has been exhausted. A \ngenerally similar pattern is observed during the test of 2000 though the stabilization of \ndrawdown indicated by negative deflections in the pressure derivative between 9 and 17 \nhours, is less pronounced. An unconfined aquifer response to pumping is consistent with the \nobservation that the static water level in each well approximates the depth (17 m below \nground level) at which water was struck in the aquifer during drilling (Figure 3). \nThe establishment of radial-flow conditions during each test is clearly indicated by \nplots of the pressure derivative and flow dimension (Figure 4). A generally consistent \npressure derivative observed after the first day of pumping in each tracer test (apart from \ntemporary disruptions in pumping discussed above), signals radial flow unaffected by \nconstant-head or no-flow boundary conditions. Consistent with this inference, mean flow \ndimension closely approximates 2 (i.e. radial flow) after the first day of pumping in both \n1999 (n = 1.8) and 2000 (n = 1.9) (Figure 4).  \nHaving deduced conditions of radial flow and unconfined aquifer storage at the test \nsite, the analytical solutions of Neuman (1975) and Moench (1993) for an unconfined aquifer \nwere applied to the drawdown responses in the injection well and closely approximated field \n 11 \nobservations (e.g. Figure 5). Estimates of hydraulic conductivity (K) for the weathered \ncrystalline rock aquifer derived from each solution are identical (1.2 m\u22c5day-1) and consistent \nwith values for this aquifer observed in other areas of Uganda (Taylor and Howard 2000). An \nestimate of 0.23\u00b10.5 for the specific yield (Sy) is derived from the Moench (1993) solution as \nit incorporates a correction for the underestimation of Sy recognized in the Neuman (1975) \nsolution.   \n \nSolute transport - chloride \n \nThe breakthrough curve for the conservative solute tracer, chloride, is plotted versus \ntime in Figure 6.  Reported concentrations of the chloride tracer are in excess of a stable, \nbackground chloride concentration of 39.4 mg\u22c5l-1. Chloride recovered over the test period \nrepresents 70% of the mass applied in the injection well. The average linear velocity of \nground water flow, based on 50% recovery of applied chloride tracer, is 1.6 m\u22c5day-1. An \nexponential decline in the concentration of chloride in the injection well was observed and \nfollows a decay constant of 1.2\u00b10.1 x 10-3 min-1 (Figure 7). Based on deductions from the \ndrawdown response (i.e. establishment of radial flow) and tracer concentrations in the \ninjection well discussed above, a radial dispersion model for a constant source (Moench and \nOgata, 1981) was adopted but employed with an exponentially decaying source term. In the \nsolution of Moench and Ogata (1981), radial dispersion is described by numerical inversion \nof the Laplace transform.  \n 12 \n The radial advective-dispersion model approximates the breakthrough curve for the \nchloride tracer in Figure 6.  The range of possible solutions to the model was constrained by \nsite details (well radius, separation distance) and the observed half-life of the chloride tracer \nin the injection well. Estimated dispersivity (\u03b1) of 0.8\u00b10.1 m over a distance (x) of 4.15 m is \nat the upper end of the scale-dependent relationship between dispersivity and distance (\u03b1 ~ \n0.1(x)) observed by Gelhar (1986). The radial dispersion model is, however, sensitive to \nvariations in the half-life of the applied chloride tracer in the injection well (t1\/2). Decreasing \nt1\/2 to 4500 min., outside of the error in the regression of the decay constant (Figure 7, Table \n1), improves the model\u2019s representation of the breakthrough curve (Figure 6) and increases \nestimated dispersivity to 0.94 m.  \n \nViral transport - bacteriophage \u03a6X174 \n \nPhage \u03a6X174 was detected in the discharge of the pumping well after 6 hours yet, \noverall, the phage tracer was largely unrecovered over the period of the test. Laboratory \nexperiments of the inactivation of phage \u03a6X174 in site ground waters at 25\u00baC yield a half-life \nof 86 hours (i.e., inactivation rate of 20 to 22% per day or 0.11 log unit per day) that is \nunaffected by the addition of the conservative tracer, NaCl.  Although observed inactivation \nof phage is more rapid than rates recorded in temperate areas (e.g., Bales et al. 1991; McKay \net al. 1993) due to the higher ground water temperatures that prevail in Uganda, this rate of \ninactivation does not explain the near-absence of detected phage in the pumping-well \n 13 \ndischarge during the 120-hour tracer test. The movement of a very small proportion of a \nmicrobial source at velocities (17 m\u22c5day-1) exceeding average linear ground water flow (1.6 \nm\u22c5day-1) is, however, consistent with observations in other terrain (e.g. Powell et al., 2003) \nand considered to result from statistically extreme sets of microscopic flow velocities \ntransporting microorganisms along a selected range of linked ground water pathways (Taylor \net al., 2004b). A decrease in the concentration of bacteriophage in the injection well was \nobserved during the test (Figure 8).  The method of sampling in which bailers are \nperiodically inserted into the injection well is, however, complicated by the fact that viruses \nare not \u2018true\u2019 solutes so that their population is not uniformly distributed in aqueous \nsolutions. The observed reduction in the concentration of bacteriophage in the injection well \nfrom 8 x 106 to 5 x 104 pfu\u22c5ml-1 over 120 hours can be explained by the processes of \ninactivation and dilution (Figure 8). \n Retardation of the bulk of the bacteriophage, relative to chloride, results from the \ncompeting processes of adsorption and desorption.  These processes depend, in part, upon the \nionic strength and pH of ground water.  The ionic strength of ground water is a measure of \nthe total dissolved ions which can act as \u2018salt bridges\u2019 to facilitate adsorption of the virion to \nthe aquifer substrate.  The pH of ground water determines the net charge on the surface of \nthe virus and, hence, its electrostatic attraction to the aquifer matrix. This dependence of a \nvirus\u2019s surface charge on pH arises from the fact that the polypeptide coat of viruses contains \namino acids with carboxylic and amino end groups whose charge varies continuously with \npH (Gerba 1984).   Viruses are, therefore, amphoteric, capable of holding positive and \n 14 \nnegative charge.  When the pH of ground water is below an isoelectric point (pI) in which \nthe virion exists in a state of zero net charge, the virion is positively charged (i.e., with \nprotonated end groups).  When the pH is above this point, the virion possesses a negative \nsurface charge (i.e., with de-protonated end groups).  \n At the test site in southeastern Uganda, the pH of ground water (5.7) was below the \npI (6.6) of bacteriophage \u03a6X174 (Dowd et al. 1998) rendering a positive, aggregate charge on \nthe surface of the bacteriophage. Observed retardation of the positively charged solute by \naluminosilicate materials with an abundance of negatively charged sites is sensible. Of \nsignificance to public health is that virus strains with a similarly high pI are also likely to be \nretarded under the commonly acidic (pH = 5 to 7) conditions of ground water in deeply \nweathered crystalline rock.  The pI and size of enteric viruses, transmitted by water (Moe \n1997), and a series of bacteriophage tracers are summarised in Table 2. Caution must be \nexercised, however, in drawing simple connections between virus transport and pI as the \ncomplexity of virus transport is such that pI not only varies with the type of virus but also its \nstrain (Gerba, 1984). It is also worth noting that desorption of sorbed viruses following a \npulse of higher pH and lower EC water has been demonstrated experimentally (Ryan and \nElimelech, 1996; Bales et al. 1997). Field evidence in weathered regoliths is lacking but \nrecent high-frequency sampling of a spring discharge in Kampala, Uganda (Miret Gaspa, \n2004) where recharge events coincide with monsoonal rainfall (Taylor and Howard 1999b), \nshows a strong correlation between recharge pulses and gross contamination of ground water \nby thermotolerant (fecal) coliforms (Figure 9). \n 15 \nConclusions \n \n The hydrogeological characteristics of deeply weathered crystalline rock have been \nestimated, some for the first time, through a forced-gradient tracer test in southeastern \nUganda where drawdown in the aquifer was monitored in an adjacent piezometer.  The \nestablishment of radial flow conditions within an unconfined aquifer during each test is \ndemonstrated using plots of derivative drawdown and flow dimension. The unconsolidated \naquifer at the base of the weathered mantle possesses a hydraulic conductivity of 1.2 m\u22c5d-1 \nand a specific yield of 0.23\u00b10.05.  Application of a radial advective-dispersion model with an \nexponentially decaying source term to the recovered conservative tracer, chloride, indicates \na dispersivity of 0.8\u00b10.1 m over a distance of 4.15 m. The average linear velocity of ground \nwater flow, based on the recovery of the chloride tracer, is 1.6 m\u22c5d-1.  Bacteriophage \u03a6X174, \napplied to the injection well as a potential field tracer of viral transport by ground water in \ndeeply weathered crystalline rock, is considered to have largely adsorbed to the aquifer  \nmatrix. Detection of low numbers of the phage tracer in the pumping-well discharge at early \ntime during the test is, however, consistent with observations in other hydrogeological \nenvironments where statistically extreme sets of microscopic flow velocities are considered \nto transport microorganisms along a selected range of linked ground water pathways.   \n \n \n \n 16 \nAcknowledgments \nThis research was carried out under a broader study, Assessing the Risk to Groundwater from \nOn-Site Sanitation (No. R6869), funded by the Department for International Development, \nUnited Kingdom.   \n 17 \nReferences \n \nAdams, M.H. 1959.
