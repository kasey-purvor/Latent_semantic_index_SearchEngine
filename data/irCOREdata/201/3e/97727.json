INTRODUCTION \n Although extensive analytical and numerical studies have been performed on the \nprocesses generating and influencing the barotropic and baroclinic seiche motion in lakes, \nthe comparable problem in gulfs and fjords has received less attention.  In particular the \nrole of sill height and off shelf boundary in influencing the radiation of energy from a \ngulf and hence determining the intensity of the seiche within the gulf and its period has \nuntil recently (Cushman-Roisin et al., 2005, Arneborg and Liljebladh, 2001) received \nlittle attention. In the case of the analytical solution of the seiche motion in a narrow lake, \na common approach is to solve the linear hydrodynamic equations in slice form, namely \nx and z space, with x the horizontal and z the vertical coordinate, subject to no flow \nthrough the lake sides. Such a model formulation and boundary conditions can be readily \nincorporated within a numerical model, and a numerical solution in close agreement with \nthe analytical can be determined (eg. Hall and Davies 2005) and subsequent problems eg. \nnon-linear or non-hydrostatic effects (eg. Berntsen and Bergh 2009) which are not \namenable to analytical solution can then be examined with the numerical model.  \nIn the case of the seiche problem in a homogenous or stratified constant depth \ngulf, the linear hydrodynamic equations in slice form can be solved analytically subject to \nno flow through the land boundary at the head of the gulf, and radiation of energy into an \ninfinitely deep ocean of infinite extent at the mouth of the gulf (eg. Cushman-Roisin et al. \n 2\n2005). In theory an identical problem can be solved numerically, although as will be \nshown here in any numerical exercise aimed at extending the gulf problem to a physically \nmore realistic situation in which there is a sill at the entrance to the gulf, and the gulf is \nconnected to the ocean by a shelf slope, there are problems in including an infinite ocean.  \nThe primary objective of this study is to examine the important parameters, \nnamely sill height and off shelf boundary that influence seiche motion in gulfs, using a \nprocess type model of wind forced motion in a gulf with idealized topography (Fig 1). \nThe effects of other parameters namely sill width and stratification are beyond the scope \nof this study. Obviously in the limit that the sill depth hs goes to zero, then there is no \nwater exchange between gulf and ocean, and the gulf response is that of a lake. A \nsecondary objective is to determine to what extent in the context of a gulf and sill, \nstratification within the gulf influences the barotropic response of the gulf to wind \nforcing. As shown by Cushman-Roisin et al. (2005), in the case of a lake, the barotropic \nresponse is not significantly influenced by baroclinic effects, whereas in a gulf the \nbaroclinic mode can radiate energy into an infinite ocean and thereby influence the \nbarotropic response, by creating stronger coupling between the barotropic and baroclinic \nmotion. Consequently in the numerical model, as the sill depth hs decreases, namely sill \nheight increases, then baroclinic energy radiation to the ocean will reduce and eventually \nreach zero when the sill height is the same as the water depth. In this case there is no flow \nat the sill, and the gulf becomes a lake. In addition to examining how the sill height, and \nocean beyond influence the gulf\u2019s barotropic response it is useful to examine how \ninternal wave generation within the gulf is influenced by the sill. \n 3\n Although the problem of how to formulate the open boundary at the entrance to a \nsemi-enclosed coastal embayment (namely a gulf) and the importance of such a \nformulation, has been examined by a number of authors e.g. de Young et al. (1993), \nDavidson et al. (2001), Zhai et al. (2008) to the authors\u2019 knowledge the influence of sill \nheight and oceanic boundary upon gulf barotropic resonance and internal wave \ngeneration has not previously been examined. \n Before proceeding to discuss the details of the numerical model and domain used \nin the present calculations it is useful to briefly review some aspects of the basic theory \ncontrolling resonance in lakes and gulfs in the absence of sills. In the case of a constant \ndepth lake of length \u2113, water depth h, and two layer stratification with upper layer density \n\u03c11, thickness h1 and lower layer \u03c12, thickness h2, neglecting rotation, the inviscid linear \nhydrodynamic equations can be readily solved subject to no flow on either land boundary \n(namely u = 0).  This solution yields a fundamental barotropic period Tb = 2\u2113\/(gh)\u00bd, with \ng accelerated due to gravity, and a baroclinic mode (internal) \n( ) \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n+=\u2032\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212=\u2032\u2032\u2032=\n21\n21122\/1\nhh\nhhhandg\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\u03c1gwherehg2T li  with \u03c1 mean density.  In \nthis case in the linear solution the surface elevation and internal displacement seiche have \na node in the centre of the lake with maximum displacement against the coastline. \n Since energy cannot be radiated out through the land boundary, and in a two layer \nlinear model energy cannot cascade to shorter wavelengths, then as shown by Heaps and \nRamsbottom (1966), in such a case damping and energy loss only occur through \nfrictional effects.  However, in more complex models containing non-linear terms and \nallowing for vertical mixing (e.g. Hall and Davies 2005) the situation is more complex.  \n 4\nIn these models vertical mixing and non-linear interaction between the waves leads to \nseiche damping. \n In the case of a seiche in a constant depth gulf of lateral extent \u2113, the equations are \nsolved subject to no flow at the coastal boundary of the gulf, and an assumed infinite \nundisturbed ocean beyond the gulf. Consequently for the solution of the gulf only \nproblem an elevation node at the open boundary can be assumed.  This gives rise to \nfundamental seiche periods ( ) 2\/1i2\/1b )hg(4Tandhg4T \u2032\u2032== ll  in essence the problem \nresembles one half of a lake.  In this case damping can occur as energy is radiated out of \nthe gulf.  As shown in analytical work using a two layer model (Cushman-Roisin et al. \n(2005)) of a gulf and infinite ocean, in this case the barotropic and baroclinic seiches are \nweakly coupled, and the period of the barotropic seiche (unlike in a lake) is slightly \ninfluenced by stratification. By radiating energy from the gulf into this ocean a significant \nenergy loss occurs within the gulf .  In addition topographic features within the gulf and \nat its entrance (e.g. the sill at the entrance to a fjord) generate internal waves with an \nassociated form drag.  Consequently in gulfs these processes, in particular energy loss by \nradiation, contribute more to seiche energy loss than bottom friction, although this must \ndepend on sill height. \n In practice there is not an infinite ocean outside a fjord or gulf, where often there \nare offshore island chains.  In addition the gulf is normally separated from an ocean of \nfinite depth by a continental shelf, the lateral extent and slope of which depends upon \ngeographic location.  Also the interior of a gulf or fjord is separated from the exterior by \na sill which is usually much shallower than the gulf and could influence the energy \n 5\nradiating from the gulf.  To date the role of the sill or the form of the off shore boundary \nin determining energy radiation from a fjord has not been studied in detail. \n In this paper an idealized cross section (slice) model (described in the next \nsection) of a gulf or fjord with associated sill, continental shelf slope and ocean beyond is \nused to examine the processes influencing seiche motion in the gulf.  Initially the depth \nand lateral extent of the ocean and the assumed boundary condition at the edge of the \nocean are considered.  In particular a no-flow condition corresponding to blocking of \nenergy radiation by an offshore island, or a free surface radiation condition used to \nrepresent an infinite domain are examined.  Subsequently, the role of the sill at the \nentrance to a gulf or fjord is considered. In all calculations the seiche motion is generated \nby an imposed spatially uniform wind stress of limited duration (see later).  This is the \nmost common process (Heaps and Ramsbottom 1966) though to generate motion in lakes \nand gulfs or fjords which are removed from tidal forcing. This wind stress corresponded \nto an on-shore wind blowing from ocean to shore (i.e. from left to right in Fig. 1). The \nnumerical model and form of the calculations are described in subsequent sections. \nResults from this series of calculations are summarized in a final conclusions section. \n2. NUMERICAL MODEL \nFollowing the recent successful use of the MIT code (see Marshall et al. 1997 for \ndetails) for modelling tidally-forced flow in sill regions (Xing and Davies 2006) this \nmodel is used in cross sectional form in the present study.  The model uses a z-coordinate \nin the vertical with a finite volume discretisation, and has a non-hydrostatic option.  A \nrecent comparison (Berntsen et al. (2006)) with a sigma coordinate non-hydrostatic \nmodel developed by Berntsen and Furnes (2005) (see also Heggelund et al. (2004)), \n 6\nshowed that the two models gave similar results.  Consequently the MIT code with a \n\u201cshaved cell\u201d approach at the sea bed appears to accurately represent topographic slopes. \nHere the model is applied in two dimensional (x,z) cross sectional form to \ndetermine wind forced seiche motion in an idealized fjord. The topography of the region \nis characterized by a deep oceanic basin (water depths ho = 1650m of length \u2113o, attached \nto a sloping continental shelf of length \u2113c, and a sill of length \u2113s and sill depth hs.  This sill \nis at the entrance to a fjord of length \u2113f and water depth hf =80m (see Fig. 1).  The coastal \n(right) side of the sill is closed, while at the oceanic open boundary (left side) of the \nregion, a closed or radiative open boundary condition is assumed. \nA fine uniform vertical grid resolution of dz = 1m was used in all calculations, \nalthough when the sill depth was reduced below 4 m, dz was reduced to 0.25 m in the top \n10m. In the horizontal the grid in the region of the shelf slope and fjord had a grid \nresolution of 10 m.  However in the deep ocean, the grid increased to 1000 m close to the \noceanic boundary.  By this means high resolution was maintained close to the region of \ninterest, namely the sill and fjord while the oceanic boundary was placed away from the \nfjord. As previously (Xing and Davies 2006) when the model was used to investigate \ntidal flow in the sill region of a fjord, the use of a fine grid  in the region of interest meant \nthat horizontal and vertical diffusivities (Kh, Kv) and corresponding viscosities (Ah, Av) \ncould be kept to a minimum in the sill region, namely Kh = Kv = 10-7m2s-1, with Ah = 10-\n1m2s-1 and Av = 10-3 m2s-1. \nMotion in the region was started (t = 0, where t indicates time) from an initial \ncondition where u = 0 and w = 0, (with u horizontal and w vertical components of \nvelocity) by the imposition of a wind stress of duration Tw and magnitude F applied at the \n 7\nsea surface. At the sea bed a quadratic friction law was used with a drag coefficient \nk=0.0025. In the stratified calculations the temperature and hence density surfaces were \ninitially horizontal with a surface mixed layer of about 40m (Fig 1). A time step dt = 2s \nwas used in all calculations, and as a narrow gulf was assumed, rotational effects were \nneglected everywhere.  \n \n3.   NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS: INFLUENCE OF SILL DEPTH \nIn an initial calculation the onshore spatially uniform wind stress was increased \nfrom zero to 0.5Pa over a 6 hour period, and maintained at this value for a further 6 hours \nbefore being \u201cswitched off\u201d. Thus the wind stress F (Pa) was of the form \nF = 0.5 sin \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n02T\nt\u03c0  for t \u2264 T0\nand F = 0.5             for T0 < t \u2264 T1\nand F = 0.0             for t > T1\nwhere t is time with T0 = 6hrs and T1 = 2T0 in these calculations, aimed at examining the \ninfluence of sill depth hs upon motion in the region, the western (left) open boundary was \nclosed.  \n3.1 Pulse wind forced motion (Calc 1)(hs = 4m) \nIn an initial calculation (Calc1), the topography of the region was as shown in Fig \n1, with the sill depth hs = 4m, typical of a shallow fjord sill. Wind induced circulation in \nthe region was produced by the wind stress described previously.  This had the effect of \ndriving surface water over the sill (Fig. 2a), giving rise to an increase in surface elevation \nat Posn A (Fig. 2a) located next to the fjord land boundary.  Associated with the increase \nin elevation at this location is a vertical downwelling velocity which leads to a downward \n 8\ndisplacement of the thermocline (Fig 2a) at the coastal boundary and on the western side \nof the sill. In addition there is an upward displacement on the right side of the sill. \nAssociated with these regions are downwelling and upwelling vertical velocities (w). As \ntime progresses (t=12hrs) further downwelling occurs at the coastal boundary of the gulf, \nwith upwelling at the sill (Fig 2b). Associated with this is an internal wave train that \nleaves the coastal boundary region (Fig 2b). Following the switching off of the wind \nforcing at t=12hrs, the pycnocline in the gulf exhibits first mode internal seiche motion \nbetween the coastal boundary and the right hand side of the sill (Fig 2c). This is identical \nto that found in a flat bottom lake (Hall and Davies 2005) where upwelling\/downwelling \nof the thermocline occurs at opposite ends of the lake, with a nodal point in the centre. In \nthe present case the righthand side of the sill acts like a wall, and seiche motion takes \nplace between this and the coast, with a nodal point close to the centre of the gulf. In \nessence a standing internal wave is formed in the gulf. \nTime series of the free surface elevation at Posn A (close to the coastal boundary \nat the head of the gulf) show (Fig 3a, note time origin starts at t = 0.5 days, after the \ninitial spin up period) an initial increase in elevation as the surface wind stress forces \nwater over the edge of the sill and elevations at the head of the gulf rapidly increase. \nSubsequently following the removal of the wind stress, elevations decrease as barotropic \nenergy is radiated over the sill, with the elevation time series (Fig 3a) exhibiting damped \nperiodic motion with a period of about 4hrs.  \nAcross basin free surface elevation contours (Fig 4) reveal that initially sea \nsurface elevation increases rapidly at the coastal boundary with a small decrease in the \nocean. As barotropic energy radiates from the gulf, sea surface elevation decreases in this \n 9\nregion. As time progresses and surface elevations decrease in the gulf, elevation nodal \npoints are evident at about x = 400km, a whole basin response, x = 45km, a gulf shelf \nedge response, with some indication as surface elevations decrease to zero on the shelf, of \na nodal point on the shelf at about x = 25km, that would correspond to a weak \u201clake like\u201d \nbarotropic seiche on the shelf, between the sill and the coastal boundary of the gulf. From \nsimple theory, with a gulf depth of 80m, this gives a barotropic wave speed of 28.0ms-1, \nand for the stratification used here a first mode baroclinic wave speed of about 0.3ms-1. \nTaking the region between the top of the sill and the coastal boundary to exhibit a \u201cweak \nlake type\u201d response, then with \u2113=35km, the barotropic lake period would be about 0.69 \nhrs. In the case of the gulf period, if the node was located on top of the sill, this would \ngive a period of about 1.38hrs. However, as shown in Fig. 4, the nodal point occurs \nfurther off shore at about x = 45km. This has the effect of increasing the gulf length \u2113, \nand because the sill is now included within this \u201ceffective\u201d gulf region, the average water \ndepth is reduced. Taking the effective water depth as 50m, gives a barotropic wave speed \nof 22.1 ms-1, and a \u201cgulf-ocean\u201d resonance period based on \u2113=45km of about 2.3hrs, \nalthough this would increase if the \u201ceffective gulf\u201d was longer and shallower. In the case \nof  the \u201cwhole basin\u201d responses in the deep ocean region h=1650m, giving a barotropic \nwave speed of 127.2ms-1, while on the shelf h=80m, giving a speed of 28.0ms-1. \nFactoring these by the relative lengths of the two regions, namely 650 and 70km, gives an \naverage barotropic speed of about 118 ms-1. Consquently in terms of a whole basin \u201clake \ntype response\u201d, this gives a period of about 3.4hrs, although again this depends upon the \neffective length of the ocean and shelf regions, and water depths taking account of the \npresence of the sill. In practice the presence of the sill and shelf slope, makes the analysis \n 10\nmore complex than the approach used above. However this simple method gives some \ninsight into the origins of the various periods found in the time series. Power spectra of \nthe time series at Posn A (Fig 3a), reveal (Fig 5a), peaks at about 3.90 hrs (assumed to \noriginate from the whole basin seiche), 2.76hrs (related to the ocean-gulf resonance) and \na very weak peak at 0.66hrs corresponding to the shallow water across basin shelf \noscillations found in Fig 4. \n In a subsequent calculation aimed at determining how the gulf barotropic period \nis influenced by stratificant as shown by Cushman-Roisin et al. (2005), the calculation \nwas repeated without stratification effects. The derived power spectra (not presented) \nwere indistinguishable from that given in Fig 5a. One reason for this is that the gulf \nspectral peak at 2.76hrs is very small (Fig 5a) and rather broad due to having to perform a \npower spectral analysis on the limited time series following the removal of the wind \nstress when the surface elevation is non zero. Also based upon Cushman-Roisin et al. \n(2005) the change in period produced by stratification effects would be of order about \n0.002hrs, and to distinguish this from the homogenous solution spectrum would require a \nstrong narrow peak. In addition as shown by Cushman-Roisin et al. (2005) the barotropic \nperiod is modified by baroclinic effects in a gulf much more than in a lake because \ninternal waves can radiate out of a flat bottom gulf which is connected to an infinite \nocean. As shown here, when there is a sill and the stratification lies well below the top of \nthe sill, the baroclinic response in the gulf is an internal seiche, namely the same as would \noccur in a lake. In essence the presence of a sill in the present case leads to a standing \ninternal wave in the gulf, rather than a progressive internal wave which radiates \nbaroclinic energy out of the gulf as in the analytical work of Cushman-Roisin et al. \n 11\n(2005). In addition the barotropic gulf response to a wind leads to a small broad peak in \nthe spectrum and any small effect upon the gulf frequency from the stratification (of \norder 0.002hrs) will be difficult to detect. \nIn order to avoid these problems, and enhance the amplitude and reduce the width \nof the power spectrum peak at T = 2.76hrs in subsequent calculations the same wind \nmagnitude and duration was used but the wind stress F (Pa) was periodic and of the form: \nF = 0.5 sin \nRT\nt\u03c02  for t \u2264 T1 ,\nF = 0.0               for t > T1 ,\nwhere T1 = 4.25Tr, but TR = 2.7hrs approximates the gulf resonant frequency. In addition \nto increasing the barotropic power input at the 2.76 hr period, as will be shown this gives \nrise to a significant internal wave that propagates away from the coastal boundary. By \nthis means how the sill influences this propagating internal wave can be examined for a \nrange of sill heights. \n3.2. Limited duration sinusoidal forced motion (Calc2)(hs=4m) \nIn this calculation the model domain and stratification were as previously, \nhowever motion was induced by the combined pulse and sinusoidal wind stress as \ndescribed previously. Time series of the free surface elevation at Posn A (Fig. 3b) shows \na periodic variation with periods between 2 hrs and 4 hrs during the first day.  The \namplitude of this variation decreases with time once the wind forcing is removed, as \nbarotropic energy is radiated from the gulf back into the ocean.  In addition as time \nprogresses the solution is progressively dominated by a single period of about 3 hrs. \nTime series of the vertical displacement of the thermocline at Posn A (not \npresented), shows an initial downward displacement, followed by long periods (namely \n 12\nperiods longer than the free surface elevation) oscillations of decreasing amplitude.  This \nreduction in amplitude is because initially the downwelling region occurs in a thin \nboundary layer adjacent to the coast, with a corresponding upwelling next to the sill (Hall \nand Davies 2005).  This generates internal gravity waves that propagate away from these \nregions with a speed (g\u2032 h\u2032)\u00bd of order 0.3ms-1 and hence baroclinic energy is lost from the \nlateral boundary layers into the interior of the gulf, as shown by the distribution of \nvertical velocity contours at t = 6 hrs (Fig. 6a).  Associated with this there appears to be a \ndecrease in baroclinic energy in the lateral boundary layers.  Besides producing internal \nwaves within the gulf, internal waves are generated on the western side of the sill and \npropagate into the ocean.  However, as the ocean is very deep and their speed of \npropagation is slow then within the integration period considered here, namely 72 hours, \nthey are mainly concentrated on the shelf slope and are unaffected by the western oceanic \nboundary which is well removed from the gulf region. However, in the gulf region \ninternal waves generated at the sill do propagate towards the centre of the gulf as shown \nby the vertical velocity distribution at t = 6hrs (Fig 6a). Although there is some internal \nwave propagation from the sill into the gulf, it is evident that the strongest internal wave \npropagation is from the coast (Fig 6a). As time progresses the internal waves propagate \ninto the centre of the gulf giving rise to significant internal waves throughout the gulf \n(see vertical velocities at t = 12hrs, Fig 6b). Subsequently (t = 18hrs) there are strong \ninternal waves in the sill region of the gulf (Fig 6c) which persist for some time (Fig 6d) \nuntil eventually the internal wave field within the gulf decays through a combination of \nform drag, radiation and dissipation. \n 13\nConsider first the time decay of the free surface seiche in the region. Since the \npropagation speed of the free surface wave is given by (gh)\u00bd, then within 36 hrs any \nbarotropic disturbance generated in the shelf edge or coastal regions can propagate to the \noceanic boundary.  As in the present calculation this boundary is closed, barotropic \nenergy is reflected from it, and a standing free surface elevation wave is produced.  \nAcross basin free surface elevation contours at 6 hourly intervals show initially a \ntransition period (Fig. 7) where surface elevation increases at the coastal boundary (right \nside of domain) with no change in the interior.  However, as surface gravity waves \npropagate into the domain from the coastal boundary, sea surface elevation changes over \nthe whole region, and nodal points (positions of zero elevation) develop in the interior, \nalthough the position of these points changes slightly with time. \nOn the longer time scale (Fig. 7) a standing wave develops with a nodal point \nsituated in the region of the sill and shelf slope, namely at about x = 35km (Fig 7). In \naddition a nodal point develops in the ocean at about x = 400km, corresponding to a \nbarotropic seiche node between the closed oceanic boundary and the western end of the \ngulf.  \nPower spectra of the free surface elevation at A, based on time series for the \nwhole period, show (Fig. 5b) a peak at 3.92 hrs in essence the whole deep water basin \nresponse corresponding to a lake of period Tb = 2Lb\/Cb with Lb = 720km, and Cb a mean \nspeed of propagation (see earlier analysis). A second dominant peak since this is the \nforcing frequency, is at 2.77hrs, namely a gulf response Tg = 4 Lg\/Cg with a node in the \nregion to the west of the sill, and Lg of order 100 km, and Cg a mean speed for the region.  \nIn addition there is a small peak at 0.67 hours corresponding to the sill blocking the flow, \n 14\nin essence a lake response namely T\u2113 = 2 L\u2113\/C\u2113 with L\u2113 = 35 km the lake dimension and \nC\u2113 = 28.0m based on a water depth of 80 m(see earlier analysis). As previously the power \nspectra computed from a homogenous calculation (not presented) was indistinguishable \nfrom Fig. 5b. \n3.3 Reduced Sill Depth (Calc 3) (hs = 1 m) \nTo determine to what extent the sill height influenced the whole basin and gulf \nresponse, the previous calculation was repeated (Calc 3) with hs = 1 m.  In this case \nsignificantly less water was able to flow over the sill and elevation increase at A was \nappreciably less (compare time series (b) and (c) in Fig. 3).  As previously, after about \n1.5 days the elevation signal was dominated by a period of about 3 hrs. Snap shots of the \nvertical velocity at t = 12hrs (Fig 8a) show that internal wave propagation from the \ncoastal boundary into the interior of the lake has been reduced compared to previously \n(Fig. 6b). This gives rise to significantly stronger vertical velocities in the coastal region \nsince the internal wave has not propagated as far away as previously (Calc 2) from its \ngeneration point. Although some propagation towards the sill has occurred by t = 24hrs \n(Fig 8b) this is significantly smaller than found with the 4m sill depth (Fig 6d). In \naddition, on the longer term (Fig 8c), calculations showed that more internal wave energy \nwas trapped in the gulf when hs = 1m compared to 4m. This is to be expected in that as hs \ngoes to zero, the gulf becomes a lake and internal wave energy cannot propagate out of \nthe region. This comparison between hs = 4m and 1m, clearly shows that even small \ndifferences in hs when the across sill water depth is shallow can influence the internal \nwave field. \n 15\nAcross basin elevation contours (not presented) showed that the nodal point had \nmoved slightly closer to the sill. However, as the magnitude of the free surface elevation \nresponse had also reduced, the exact location of the nodal point in the ocean was unclear. \nThis is reflected in the power spectra (Fig 5c) based upon elevation time series at A over \nthe whole period, which showed no peak at the basin wide frequency, with a sharp peak, \nalthough reduced energy (due to a decrease in water crossing over the sill) at the gulf \nperiod.  The gulf period namely Tg = 2.94hrs had also been increased slightly due to the \nshift in nodal point changing the length Lg,and effective gulf depth. In addition the peak \nat about 0.67 hrs increased relative to the background energy, compared to previously, \nshowing that as the sill height increases the local response of the gulf corresponds to that \nof a lake, which is to be expected in the limit as hs = 0. \n As previously, power spectra computed without stratification were \nindistinguishable from those computed with. As discussed earlier, this is to be expected \nsince internal wave energy loss by radiation from the gulf is negligible. As shown by \nCushman-Roisin et al. (2005) this must be significant if appreciable coupling between the \ngulf\u2019s barotropic mode and baroclinic radiating waves is to occur. However, it is clear \nthat a small reduction in hs has affected the propagation of the baroclinic waves in the \ngulf on the short time scale, and slightly modified the values of the barotropic seiche \nperiods Tg and Tl. Subsequent calculations (not presented) showed that decreasing hs \nproduced a further decrease of energy within the gulf, and eventually when hs = 0, \nobviously the gulf response became that of a lake, and a single peak occurred in the \npower spectrum at about t = 0.67 hours. \n3.4   Increase in sill depth (Calc 4) (hs = 40 m) \n 16\nIn the previous series of calculations the stratification in the gulf lay below the sill \nheight, and hence any internal waves generated on the righthand side of the sill were \npartially trapped in the gulf. In the present calculation by reducing the sill depth to the \nlevel of the thermocline, namely hs = 40m, internal waves generated at the sill or the \neastern end of the gulf could more readily radiate out of the gulf.  As shown previously \nwithin the time period considered here, the western boundary had no direct influence on \nthe internal waves in the sense of wave reflection into the gulf region, but could affect the \nbarotropic response. \nOn the short time scale (t=6hrs, Fig 9a) comparison of a snapshot of w velocity \ncomponents with those derived previously with hs = 4 m (Fig. 6a) showed that only very \nweak internal waves were generated in the sill region. In addition those generated at the \ncoast were not substantially different to those found when hs = 4m (compare Figs 6a and \n9a). This is to be expected since the stratification does not intersect the sill topography, \nthen the main source of internal wave generation is at the coast. On the longer time scale \n(t = 18hrs), the internal wave pulse produced at the coast by the wind impulse propagates \ntowards the sill, as seen in the vertical velocity distribution (Fig 9b). As the sill is \nappreciably deeper in this calculation than previously (Calc 2), the internal waves can \npropagate over the sill and there is no build up of internal waves in the sill region as \nfound in Calc 2 (compare Figs 9b and 6c). The propagation of internal waves over the \nsill, rather than the trapping found with hs = 4m, is clearly evident at t = 24hrs from a \ncomparison of Figs 6d and 9c. Consequently, besides the influence of the sill height upon \ninternal wave generation in the gulf, in the present calculation, internal waves can radiate \n 17\nout of the gulf as shown in the different characteristics of the vertical velocity induced by \nthe density field. \nTime series of the free surface elevation at A (Fig 3d) exhibit similar \ncharacteristics to that found with a sill depth of 4m (Fig. 3b).  However, the tendency \ntowards a single period is diminished, and even after 1.6 days multiple periods are \npresent (Fig. 3d). \nAs previously (Calc 2) barotropic energy that radiates from the gulf is reflected \nfrom the oceanic boundary and seiche motion is generated in the ocean.  Across basin \nelevation contours (Fig. 10) exhibit a similar behaviour to that found with hs = 4 m (Calc \n2) (compare Figs. 10 and 7).  However, even after 1.6 days it is evident from the time \nseries (Fig 3d) that there is no dominant period, and as shown by the across basin \ncontours of surface elevation, the nodal point positions change with time (Fig 10). \nPower spectra of the free surface elevation at A show (Fig. 5d) peaks at about \n3.20 hours and 1.94 hrs, corresponding to a whole basin and gulf responses, but with \nslightly changed lengths and mean depths, due to the change in position of the nodal \npoint produced by the increase in sill depth.  In addition, unlike previously where the \nshorter period gulf response dominated (see Fig. 5b), in the present case both peaks have \na comparable magnitude (Fig. 5d). As previously calculations were also performed \nwithout stratification and power spectra based on the elevation time series at A were \ncomputed. Although in this case it is evident that internal wave radiation out of the gulf \ndoes occur, no significant differences were found in power spectra computed with and \nwithout stratification. This arises because the power spectra were computed using the full \ntime series, whereas the internal wave propagation following the wind pulse is a transient \n 18\nevent, as found in nature following wind forcing, which only occurs for part of the \nperiod. Unfortunately if only the part of the time series when internal waves are present is \nused then the spectral peaks broaden and are not significantly different under \nhomogenous and stratified conditions. As in the previous two calculations changes in sill \ndepth hs appreciably change the internal wave response in the gulf to wind forcing. \n3.5   Removal of Sill (hs = 80m) (Calc 5) \nFor the case in which the sill is removed (Calc 5) weak internal waves are \ngenerated at the shelf edge and can propagate both onto the shelf and back into the ocean \nas shown by vertical velocity contours, t = 6 hrs (Fig. 11a).  In addition as found in earlier \ncalculations, internal wave generation is mainly in the coastal boundary layer region with \npropagation away from the coast (Fig. 11a). On the short time scale (t = 6hrs) internal \nwave propagation away from its coastal generation region is independent of sill height \n(compare Figs 6a, 9a and 11a). However, on the longer time scale (t = 18hrs) when the \ninternal waves have reached the sill, their propagation is influenced by the sill, even when \nhs = 40m (compare Figs 9b and 11b). In the case of no sill, as to be expected the internal \nwaves readily propagate into the ocean (Fig 11c). Although even when hs =40m, it is \nevident from a comparison of Figs 11c and 9c, the sill does not significantly reduce \ninternal wave propagation out of the gulf. In the absence of the sill the majority of \ninternal wave propagation is towards the ocean and by t = 36 hrs (not presented) there is \nonly a small on-shelf response. \nTime series of the sea surface elevation response at Posn A as previously (Calc 4) \nshows that initially the wind excites a number of periods, however after about 1.5 days \nthe time series is dominated by a period of about 3 hrs (Fig. 3e).  Contours of cross basin \n 19\nelevation (Fig.12) show a number of nodal points, the position of which change with \ntime, giving rise to the various frequencies found in the time series.  However, no time \ninvariant single nodal point is found in the shelf edge region (Fig 12). In addition in the \noceanic region although there appears to be a nodal point at about x = 350km, this also \nvaries with time. \nPower spectra of free surface elevation at position A show (Fig 5e) a dominant \nperiod at about 3.18 hrs, corresponding to the seiche period of the whole domain.  In \naddition two other seiche modes are excited with periods of about 1.79 hrs and 1.35 hrs \nassociated with nodal points located in the shelf edge region, giving rise to seiche motion \non the continental shelf.  The absence of the sill that occurred in Calc 2, which in essence \n\u201canchored\u201d the location of a \u201cgulf\u201d type response with a node located near the sill, \nexplains why the node in the shelf edge region varies with time. In addition although the \nregion is forced by a wind impulse perturbed by a superimposed 2.76hr period wind, it is \nevident that in the absence of a sill, the expected \u201cgulf like response\u201d of 2.76hrs does not \nappear. This shows that the short duration sinusoidal wind forcing does not dominate the \nbarotropic resonant period which is primarily influenced by the topography. However, as \npreviously there was no difference in spectra computed with and without stratification. \n4. NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS: INFLUENCE OF THE OFF SHELF \nBOUNDARY \nIn the previous series of calculations, the off shelf boundary was assumed to be \nclosed.  Consequently both barotropic and baroclinic waves were generated and could be \nreflected from both boundaries.  In essence the speed of propagation of the baroclinic \nwaves, and the large oceanic domain of the model meant that baroclinic waves generated \n 20\nat the off shelf boundary, within the integration period considered, did not reach the gulf \nregion and hence the baroclinic response of this area was not affected by any reflected \ninternal wave.  However, in the case of barotropic waves their propagation speed was so \nfast that reflection could occur at the off shelf boundary, and a whole domain seiche was \ngenerated in addition to the local \u201cgulf\u201d and \u201clake\u201d type seiche motion generated on the \nshelf.  To determine to what extent the off shelf boundary influenced the on shelf \nresponse, Calc 2 (hs = 4 m) was repeated with a progressive wave barotropic radiation \ncondition applied on the western (off shelf) boundary (Calc 6). \nThe effect of applying a radiation condition on the western boundary is that \nbarotropic waves generated at the coastal boundary at the head of the fjord due to wind \nforcing are no longer reflected at the off shelf boundary and barotropic energy can radiate \nout of the domain.  This gives rise to a rapid decrease in the sea surface elevation at \nPosition A (Fig. 3f) as energy is radiated from the coastal region out of the model \ndomain. \nComparison of \u201csnap shots\u201d of w velocity on the short time scale (t = 6hrs) (Fig \n13a) with those generated with a closed off shore boundary (Fig 6a) show no appreciable \ndifference in the on-shelf internal wave field. However, on the longer time scale (t = \n12hrs) there are significant differences on the oceanic side of the sill between the vertical \nvelocities associated with the internal wave field computed with a closed western \nboundary (Fig 6b) and an open boundary (Fig 13b). In addition there are some small \nchanges on the shelf in the region next to the sill (compare Figs 6b and 13b). On the \nlonger time scale (t = 24hrs) it is evident that although both calculations show that the \ninternal waves decay on the shelf, this decay is more rapid when a barotropic radiation \n 21\ncondition is applied off shore than when this boundary is closed as in the case of an off \nshore island. To understand this, it is valuable to compare cross sectional displacements \nof the free surface elevation computed with the radiation condition (Fig 14) with those \nderived previously (Fig 7). \nIn the case of the barotropic radiation condition, after some initial (namely upto t \n= 12hrs) whole basin seiche motion with a node at about x = 400km (Fig 14), sea surface \nelevations within the ocean rapidly decrease to zero as barotropic energy is radiated \nthrough the western boundary. This response on the longer term (t > 12hrs) is very \ndifferent than previously (Fig. 7) where the continuous whole basin barotropic seiche \nmotion gives rise to upwelling and downwelling at the shelf edge which produces the \nstrong vertical velocities in this region that are evident in Fig. 6d, but not Fig 13c. In \nessence the differences that are evident in the internal wave field in the shelf edge and sill \nregion between Figs 6d and 13c are not related to internal wave propagation but are due \nto the whole basin barotropic seiche motion. This shows that even in the case of a \nshallow sill the presence of an off shore island will influence the internal wave field close \nto the sill, because of barotropic seiche motion that can occur in the region. In the present \ncalculation the offshore island, namely the western boundary, is well removed from the \nsill and hence this effect will be less than that found in nature where off shore islands are \nwithin 100km of the entrance to fjords or lochs (e.g. the Hebrides islands off the west \ncoast of Scotland).   \nFrom Fig 3f it is evident that superimposed upon the decaying elevation at A, is a \nsinusoidal motion of period about 3.5 hrs.  Contours of free surface elevation across the \nwhole model domain show (Fig. 14) that in essence surface elevation close to the oceanic \n 22\nboundary is near zero, with a nodal point located at about x = 38km. Using this location \nfor the nodal point associated with the gulf, gives a period of order 3.5hrs. The rapid \ndecay of the sea surface elevation that is evident in Figs 3f and 14, means that peaks \nwithin the power spectrum will be broad rather than the sharp peaks found previously. \nPower spectra of the elevation time series at A, shows (Fig. 5f) two peaks, the dominant \none, namely gulf like response at about 3.67 hrs, and a smaller peak, namely the lake \nresponse at 0.67 hrs. \nThis calculation clearly shows that the western open boundary has a significant \ninfluence upon the location of the nodal point associated with the seiche motion in the \ngulf.  In addition, as to be expected, if a radiation condition is applied on this boundary, \nthen energy is lost from the model domain, and free surface seiching within the gulf is \nrapidly damped.  Although the gulf seiche period is influenced by the western open \nboundary because it affects the location of the associated node, the lake seiche period is \nnot substantially affected because its node is influenced by local topography, namely sill \nlocation, with intensity influenced by sill height. \n \n5.   CONCLUDING DISCUSSION \nA cross sectional model of an idealised constant depth gulf or fjord with a sill at \nits entrance connected to a constant depth deep ocean was used to examine the bartropic \nand baroclinic response of the region to wind forcing. Calculations were performed with \na range of sill heights and off shelf boundary conditions corresponding to an offshore \nisland (no normal flow through the island) or a radiation condition, namely an ocean of \ninfinite extent. The objective of the calculations was to examine to what extent the sill \n 23\nheight at the entrance to the gulf influenced the barotropic and baroclinic response of the \ngulf to wind forcing. In addition the extent to which the stratification in the gulf \ninfluenced its barotropic response, particularly when internal wave energy was radiated \nfrom the gulf (Cushman-Roisin et al., 2005) was also considered. In the case of the initial \nwind stress of 12 hours duration and a tall sill the baroclinic response in the gulf took the \nform of a first mode internal seiche between the sill and the coast. In this case little or no \ninternal progressive wave was generated in the gulf. Calculations with a closed off shore \nboundary showed that the major barotropic period was at approximately Tb = 3.9 hrs \ncorresponding to a whole domain barotropic seiche. A second, shorter seiche period, \nnamely that involving the sill\/shelf edge region and head of the gulf was also present. \nIdentical barotropic calculations showed that these barotropic periods could not be \ndistinguished from those computed with stratification. One reason for this is that the \nspectral peaks at the barotropic resonance frequency were very broad, and the peaks were \nnot particularly strong due to the form of the wind forcing. Consequently any change in \ntheir frequency due to the presence of stratification could not be determined. In addition \nthe standing wave nature of the internal wave in the calculation, due to the high sill meant \nthat baroclinic wave energy could not be lost by radiation as in the Cushman-Roisin et al. \n(2005) theory. \nTo avoid these problems the wind forcing was modified to include a sinusoidal \ncomponent at the gulf frequency, although as previously a ramped form of forcing, \nfalling to zero after 12hrs was applied. In this case progressive internal waves were \ngenerated at the coastal boundary at the head of the gulf. As time progressed these waves \npropagated towards the sill. In the case of a high sill, the internal waves could not \n 24\npropagate over it but were trapped close to the sill. As the sill depth decreased such that \nthe pycnocline intersected the sill then internal waves could radiate energy over the sill. \nIn the limit that there was no sill, internal wave propagation from the gulf into the ocean \ncould readily occur. Despite the fact that wind forcing of a form that contained the gulf \nperiod, significantly enhanced the energy in the gulf\/ocean resonant peak, and sharpened \nthe peak, together with generating radiating progressive internal waves, no difference in \nbarotropic resonant periods between the stratified and homogenous solutions could be \nidentified. However calculations did show that the sill height significantly influenced the \nradiation of baroclinic energy by propagating internal waves. In addition the resonant \nbarotropic gulf seiche period was influenced by sill height. \nCalculations using a barotropic radiative off shore boundary, showed that the \nenhanced loss of energy due to this boundary condition lead to a significant broadening \nof the barotropic spectral response. Consequently differences in resonant frequency due \nto including stratification effects could not be determined. In addition to influencing the \nbarotropic spectral response, the internal wave response in the sill region was modified. \nThis suggests that the \u201cclassic\u201d approach to modelling wind forced internal wave motion, \nof placing a barotropic radiating boundary condition far away from the region of interest \nmay not be perfect. Although the distance between the open boundary and region of \ninterest may be sufficiently large that internal waves reflected from it cannot propagate \nback to the region of interest within the integration period, any false barotropic \npropagation into the region can influence the baroclinic solution.  \nIn essence the calculations presented here show that sill height and off-shore \nboundary have an important role in determining the nature of the baroclinic response of a \n 25\ngulf to wind forcing. Consequently it is important to consider the role of the sill and \nadjacent ocean in any modelling excersise. In addition, although Cushman-Roisin et al. \n(2005) have clearly shown that when a gulf region can lose energy by internal wave \nradiation, the barotropic seiche period is changed, this could not be demonstrated here \ndue to a lack of accuracy in computing resonant frequencies. At present it is not clear \nhow to overcome this problem. However, the present calculations, unlike those of \nCushman-Roisin et al. (2005) which considered only a constant depth gulf, clearly show \nthat sill height compared to pycnocline depth will control the radiation of internal wave \nenergy out of the gulf, and hence the modification of the resonant barotropic frequency \nby baroclinic effects. This is to be expected since once the sill reaches the sea surface, the \ngulf in essence becomes a lake, from which internal wave energy radiation is not possible \nand hence as shown by Cushman-Roisin et al. (2005) the barotropic seiche period is not \nsubstantially affected by stratification. \n 26\nREFERENCES \nArneborg, L. and Liljebladh, B. (2001)  The internal seiches in Gullmar Fjord.
