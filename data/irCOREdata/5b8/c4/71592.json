These\nmodels have since developed into one of two paradigms\nof quantum chaos [2,3]. The other paradigm is the 2D\nbilliard of irregular shape [4]. Two is the lowest number of\ndimensions for nonintegrable (chaotic) dynamics in au-\ntonomous systems, since a single constant of motion is\nsufficient for integrability in 1D. The 1D models get\naround this constraint through a periodically time-\ndependent external force (\u2018\u2018kick\u2019\u2019), which eliminates the\nenergy as a constant of motion\u2014but still conserves the\nquasienergy (analogously to quasimomentum conserva-\ntion in a periodic lattice). The two paradigms share a\ncommon set of phenomena in the fields of quantum chaos\nand localization [5\u20138].\nThe combination of chaos and superconductivity\nproduces an entirely new phenomenology, notably the\nappearance of an excitation gap as a signature of quantum\nchaos [9]. The paradigm common to most of the litera-\nture is the 2D billiard connected to a superconductor\n[10], introduced under the name \u2018\u2018Andreev billiard\u2019\u2019 in\nRef. [11]. The name refers to the Andreev reflection which\noccurs at the interface with the superconductor, where an\nelectron at energy \" above the Fermi level is converted\ninto a hole at energy \" below it.\nFrom the point of view of computational efficiency,\ncompact quantum maps such as the kicked rotator [1] (a\nparticle confined to a circle and driven periodically in\ntime with a strength that depends on its position) are\nmuch more powerful than 2D models such as billiards.\nIndeed, there exists a highly efficient diagonalization\ntechnique that works only for maps [12]. The lack of a\n1D map for quantum chaos with superconductivity has\nhindered the numerical test of a variety of analytical\npredictions [13\u201320]. Most notably, numerical efforts\nhave not been able to distinguish the conflicting predic-\ntions [9] of random-matrix theory (RMT) and the semi-\nclassical Bohr-Sommerfeld (BS) quantization: RMT0031-9007=03=90(20)=207004(4)$20.00BS gives an exponentially vanishing density of states\nwithout a true gap. Recent analytical work [16\u201320] has\npredicted that diffraction creates a gap in the BS density\nof states at the inverse Ehrenfest time. This has never been\nseen in computer simulations, because the Ehrenfest time\nscales logarithmically with the system size and is usually\nfar too small to play a role. For these reasons there is a\nreal need for something like a \u2018\u2018quantum Andreev map.\u2019\u2019\nDoes it exist? If it does, can it be simulated more effi-\nciently than the Andreev billiard? These are the issues\naddressed in this paper.\nWe show how to construct quantum Andreev maps out\nof any conventional quantum map (not necessarily cha-\notic), in much the same way as any normal billiard can be\nturned into an Andreev billiard by coupling it to a super-\nconductor. The construction is guided by the classical\nelectron and hole dynamics on the Poincare\u00b4 surface of\nsection of an Andreev billiard. The Andreev kicked ro-\ntator is a particular example of such an Andreev map. We\ncertify that it possesses the phenomenology of the\nAndreev billiards and search for predictions of RMT\nand semiclassics. We leave for future investigations the\napplication of the Andreev map to other kicked models\n(possibly with a different phenomenology), such as the\nkicked top [3] and the Fermi-Ulam model [21].\nA quantum map is represented by the Floquet operator\nF, which gives the stroboscopic time evolution u\u0001p\u00050\u0002 \u0003\nFpu\u00010\u0002 of an initial wave function u\u00010\u0002. (We set the\nstroboscopic period \u00050 \u0003 1 in most equations.) The uni-\ntary M\u0004M matrix F has eigenvalues exp\u0001\u0005i\"m\u0002, with\nthe quasienergies \"m 2 \u0001\u0005\t;\t\u0002 (measured in units of\n\u0006h=\u00050). This describes particle excitations in a normal\nmetal. We also need hole excitations. A particle excitation\nwith energy \"m (measured relatively to the Fermi level) is\nidentical to a hole excitation with energy \u0005\"m. This\nmeans that hole excitations in a normal metal have\nFloquet operator F\u0007 and wave function v\u0001p\u0002 \u0003 \u0001F\u0007\u0002pv\u00010\u0002.\nParticles and holes are coupled by connecting the\nnormal metal via a lead to a superconducting reservoir.\uf6d9 2003 The American Physical Society 207004-1\nP H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending23 MAY 2003VOLUME 90, NUMBER 20by a spatially localized region in which Andreev reflec-\ntion converts electrons into holes and vice versa, with\nphase shift \u0005i. (A weak energy dependence of this\nphase shift is ignored for simplicity, but can be accounted\nfor straightforwardly.) Analogously, for the quantum\nAndreev map, we assume that Andreev reflections occur\nwhenever an excitation ends up in a certain subspace of\nHilbert space. This subspace n1; n2; . . . ; nN consists of N\nout of M states in a chosen basis and corresponds to a lead\nwith N propagating channels. The N \u0004M matrix P\nprojects onto the lead. Its elements are Pnm \u0003 1 if m \u0003\nn 2 fn1; n2; . . . ; nNg and Pnm \u0003 0 otherwise. The dwell\ntime of a quasiparticle excitation in the normal metal is\n\u0005dwell \u0003 M=N, equal to the mean time between Andreev\nreflections. The fact that Andreev reflections occur only\nat multiples of the stroboscopic time \u00050 is technically\nconvenient, and should be physically irrelevant for\n\u0005dwell \n \u00050.\nPutting all this together, we construct the quantum\nAndreev map from the matrix product\nF \u0003 P\n\u0001\nF 0\n0 F\u0007\n\u0002\n; P \u0003\n\u0001\n1\u0005 PTP \u0005iPTP\n\u0005iPTP 1\u0005 PTP\n\u0002\n:\n(1)\n(The superscript \u2018\u2018T\u2019\u2019 indicates the transpose of a matrix.)\nThe particle-hole wave function \r \u0003 \u0001u; v\u0002 evolves in\ntime as \r\u0001p\u0002 \u0003 F p\r\u00010\u0002.

The Floquet\noperator F possesses a particle-hole symmetry which\nentails that its 2M eigenvalues exp\u0001\u0005i\"m\u0002 come in inverse\npairs. This symmetry is the analogue of the particle-hole\nsymmetry in Andreev billiards, in which excitation en-\nergies\r\" occur symmetrically around the Fermi level. To\navoid double counting of levels, we restrict the quasi-\nenergy to the interval \u00010; \t\u0002. The excitation spectrum of\nparticles and holes consists of the M quasienergies in this\ninterval, and the mean level spacing \t=M is twice as\nsmall as the level spacing \u0012 \u0003 2\t=M for particles and\nholes separately.

The\ntwo approaches become entirely equivalent in the context\nof RMT, when H0 is chosen from one of the Gaussian\nensembles and F is chosen from one of the circular\nensembles [24]. They are also equivalent in the semiclas-\nsical limit, when the billiard can be represented by a\nPoincare\u00b4 map which can be quantized approximately [25].\nIn the mean-field limit M\n N \n 1, RMT predicts a\nhard gap in the excitation spectrum of size ERMT \u0003 \u0017ET\n[with \u0017 \u0003 2\u00053=2\u0001 \u0004\u0004\u00045p \u0005 1\u00025=2 \u0003 0:60], and above the gap a\nsquare-root singularity in the density of states \u0018\u0001\"\u0002 \u0003\n\t\u00051\u0015\u00053=2\u0001\"\u0005 ERMT\u00021=2 (with \u0015 \u0003 0:068N1=3\u0012) [9].\nSample-to-sample fluctuations of the lowest excitation\nenergy \"0 around the mean-field gap have been calculated\nin Refs.

For \u0005E * \u0005dwell, the\nsemiclassical Bohr-Sommerfeld approximation [9,26]\nshould be valid, with a diffraction induced gap of the\norder of \u0006h=\u0005E [16]. To search for these deviations from\nRMT, we consider rotators with smaller kicking strengths\n(but still in the fully chaotic regime), thus smaller\nLyapunov exponent, and much larger M.\nIn Fig. 2, we show the density of states for M \u0003\n131 072 and K \u0003 14. Strong deviations from the RMT\nprediction are clearly visible. Also plotted is the result of\na BS calculation [9], in which we slightly smoothed the\nsingular delta functions. This approximation agrees better\nwith the exact result.

Averages have been\ncalculated with 400 (for M \u0003 512) to 40 (for M > 5\u0004 105)\ndifferent positions of the contacts to the superconductor. The\nerror bars represent the root mean square of \"0. The dashed line\nis the RMT prediction and the solid line is a linear fit to the\ndata points. Inset: Dependence of the mean gap on \u0005dwell \u0003\nM=N for K \u0003 14 and M \u0003 524 288. The dashed line is the\nRMT prediction and the solid and dotted curves are given by\nEqs.

As a further check, we tried the\nslightly different expression\n\"0\nERMT\n\u0003 1\u0005 %\n2!\u0005dwell\n\u0001lnM\u0005 %00\u0002; (9)\nwith %00 \u0003 %0 \u000f 2 ln5. The resulting curve (dotted line in\nthe inset of Fig. 3) shows significant deviations from the\nnumerical data. We conclude that Eq. (8) gives the correct\nparametric dependence of the Andreev gap.\nA discrepancy remains in the value of the numerical\ncoefficients. While the coefficient %0 is model dependent,\nthe prefactor % is expected to be universal. Our numerics\ngives % \u0003 0:59\r 0:08, in between the two competing\npredictions % \u0003 0:23 of Ref. [20] and % \u0003 2 of Ref. [19].\nIn conclusion, we have constructed a quantum map that\naccounts for the presence of superconductivity. The\nAndreev kicked rotator introduced above has been shown\nto be equivalent to the Andreev billiards studied thus far.\nOwing to the fact that it is one dimensional rather than\ntwo dimensional, it is much more efficient computation-\nally, which permits one to observe two theoretical pre-\ndictions that are currently out of reach of billiard\nsimulations: the universal gap fluctuations for a large\nLyapunov exponent and the logarithmic reduction of the\ngap for a small Lyapunov exponent. We foresee that the\nAndreev kicked rotator on a cylinder (instead of on a\ntorus) can be an equally effective tool to study the inter-\nplay of superconductivity and localization.207004-4We have benefitted from discussions with I\u02d9.
