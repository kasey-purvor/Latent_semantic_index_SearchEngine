Consequently, mRNA-fragments containing the single\ngenes and combinations of the genes ectA and ectB or ectB and ectC, respectively, could be detected\nby Northern blot analysis. Under the control of its own regulatory promoter region (ectUp) a\nseemingly osmoregulated ectoine production was observed. In addition, aspartate kinases were\nidentified as the main limiting factor for ectoine production in recombinant E. coli DH5\u03b1. Co-\nexpression of the ectoine biosynthesis genes and of the gene of the feedback-resistant aspartate\nkinase from Corynebacterium glutamicum MH20-22B (lysC) led to markedly increased production of\nectoine in E. coli DH5\u03b1, resulting in cytoplasmic ectoine concentrations comparable to those\nreached via ectoine accumulation from the medium.\nBackground\nTo master the osmotic stress of saline environments, halo-\nphilic organisms accumulate highly water-soluble organic\nosmolytes, so-called compatible solutes [1-3]. Ectoine\n(1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4-pyrimidine carboxylic\nacid), the compatible solute that was first discovered in\nEctothiorhodospira halochloris [4], is one of the most com-\nmonly found osmolytes in nature [5-9]. Besides their\nosmotic effect, ectoines as well as other compatible sol-\nutes have been found to improve protein folding and to\nprotect biomolecules such as enzymes, nucleic acids, anti-\nbodies and even whole cells against heating, freeze-thaw-\ning, drying or chemical treatment [10-14]. Additional\napplications of ectoine include use as protective additive,\nmodulator of proinflammatory response and moisturizer\nfor skin care products [15-17], and potentially also for\ntreatment of diseases related to protein misfolding [18-\n21]. In view of its potential as a stabilizing, protective and\npharmaceutical agent, a bioprocess for ectoine production\nnamed \"bacterial milking\" has been developed for com-\nmercial exploitation using the halophilic eubacterium\nHalomonas elongata [22].\nThe non-halophilic Escherichia coli has been shown to\naccumulate ectoine from the surrounding medium, and as\na consequence its tolerance to elevated salinities is\nincreased [23]. Also, recombinant E. coli XL1-Blue is able\nto express the ectoine genes ectABC from the Gram-posi-\ntive moderately halophilic Marinococcus halophilus and\nexploit the enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway for\nPublished: 29 August 2008\nSaline Systems 2008, 4:12 doi:10.1186\/1746-1448-4-12\nReceived: 19 February 2008\nAccepted: 29 August 2008\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.salinesystems.org\/content\/4\/1\/12\n\u00a9 2008 Bestvater et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nSaline Systems 2008, 4:12 http:\/\/www.salinesystems.org\/content\/4\/1\/12osmoregulated ectoine production [7]. The organization\nof the ectoine gene cluster and its relation to the ectoine\nbiosynthetic pathway is shown in Fig. 1A and 1B. A search\nfor consensus sequences for \u03c370\/\u03c3A-dependent promoters\nrevealed two potential promoter sites upstream of ectB,\nbut none at the beginning of the gene cluster [7]. Using\ndeletion derivatives, however, the authors were able to\nconclude that regulating sequences must extend up to or\nbeyond 150 bp upstream of ectA.\nIn this study, we report the transcription initiation sites of\nthe ectoine gene cluster as determined by RACE (rapid\namplification of cDNA ends) in both, the donor Marinoc-\noccus halophilus as well as the genetically engineered E. coli\nDH5\u03b1. In addition, we report on potential metabolic lim-\nitions for heterologous ectoine production and the gener-\nation of a new recombinant production strain freed from\none such metabolic \"bottle-neck\" which limits substrate\nsupply of the ectoine biosynthetic pathway.\nResults\nNorthern analysis\nExpression of a genomic library of the halophilic Marino-\ncoccus halophilus in low-copy number vector pHSG575\n[24] resulted in the identification of the gene cluster\nencoding ectoine biosynthetic genes ectA, ectB and ectC\nand the construction of two vectors, pOSM12 and\npOSM2, enabling ectoine synthesis and enhanced salt tol-\nerance in E. coli Xl-1 blue [7]. Whereas the former carries\na region 720 bp upstream of the start codon of ectA\n(ectUp), the latter lacks regulatory elements because of a\ntruncated upstream region (100 bp only). By Northern\nblot analysis with specific RNA-probes for ectA (approx.\n0.6 kb), ectB (approx. 1.3 kb) and ectC (approx. 0.4 kb),\nwe could identify both, mRNAs of the single gene prod-\nucts and mRNAs containing ectAB and ectBC, respectively,\nin heterologous E. coli DH5\u03b1 pOSM12 (Fig. 2A). However\nwe were not able to distinguish between the bands of\nectAB (approx. 2000 bp) and ectBC (approx. 1800 bp) on\nthe ectB blot. A band corresponding to ectABC mRNA with\nan approx. size of 2500 bp could not be detected in E. coli\nDH5\u03b1. In E. coli DH5\u03b1 pOSM2 the transcription pattern\nwas different with respect to ectA. Transcription of ectA or\nectAB in DH5\u03b1 pOSM2, which had its osmoregulatory\nDNA region upstream of ectA replaced by a lac promoter,\ncould not be detected in the abscence of IPTG, whereas\nafter IPTG induction, only ectA mRNA, but no ectAB\nmRNA was produced (Fig. 2B). Transcription of ectB, ectC\nand ectBC in DH5\u03b1 pOSM2 was not influenced by IPTG\nand conformed with that of DH5\u03b1 pOSM12.\nDetermination of transcription start points by rapid \namplification of cDNA ends (RACE)\nPutative transcription initiation sites for both, the donor\n(Marinococcus halophilus) and the genetically engineered\nacceptor (E. coli DH5\u03b1) were identified using the RACE\ntechnique. The identified sites are shown in Fig. 3. Subse-\nquently potential promoter recognition sites were investi-\ngated by homology search using the Neural Network\nPromotor Prediction programme and assigned to the pre-\nviously identified initiation sites. Primary eubacterial\nsigma factors are responsible for the transcription of most\ngenes expressed in exponentially growing cells and essen-\ntial for cell survival. They are known as \u03c370 in E. coli and\n\u03c3A in Bacillus subtilis and other Gram-positive bacteria and\nhave identical consensus sequences. Non-essential sta-\ntionary-phase or general stress response \u03c3-factors of the\nEnterobacteriaceae are called \u03c3S and similar in function\n(but not in consensus sequence) to \u03c3B of B. subtilis and\nrelated organisms [25].\nIn the donor (M. halophilus) single gene transcription of\nectA and ectB appears to be under control of \u03c3A-dependent\npromoters (Fig. 3A and 3B). The initiation sites are located\n114 nucleotides and 44 nucleotides upstream of the start\ncodon for the genes ectA and ectB, respectively. In addition\nto the transcription initiation sites for the single gene\nproducts, in M. halophilus, a site for the transcription of\nectAB and\/or ectABC could be found 34 bp upstream of\nthe start codon of ectA. These results were obtained when\nthe mRNA in the RACE procedure was transcribed to\ncDNA over two consecutive genes (approx. 0.9 kb), start-\ning from an ectB-specific primer. Unfortunately, we were\nunable to detect an analogous transcription initiation site\nfor ectBC, probably because of the length of the potential\nRACE product (1.6 kb for ectBC compared to only 0.9 kb\nin the case of ectAB). In contrast to the promoters for sin-\ngle gene transcription, the transcription initiation site of\nectAB and\/or ectABC is under the control of a putative \u03c3B-\ndependent promoter (Fig. 3A). Taken into consideration\nthat the primary sigma factor \u03c3A is responsible for the\nexpression of the essential genes for cell survival, whereas\n\u03c3B mediates the general stress response, this could point\ntowards an interplay of various mechanisms regulating\nthe expression of the ectoine genes in M. halophilus. The\nRACE reverse transcription product of ectC mRNA appears\nto stop 83 nucleotides upstream of the start codon (|**\nin Fig. 3C), but no corresponding promoter consensus\nsequence could be assigned to this initiation site. There-\nfore, the possibility remains that this initiation site is an\nartefact, possibly due to the formation of a secondary\nstructure of mRNA (terminating loop), or the result of\nmRNA processing. Downstream of this hypothetical tran-\nscription initiation site a potential \u03c3A-dependent pro-\nmoter site, comprising a -10 and a -35 region, could be\nfound (Fig. 3C) with a potential transcription initiation\npoint 29 bp upstream of ectC. This promoter site is appar-\nently not used in M. halophilus under the conditions\nemployed, it is however recognized by the genetically\nengineered host, E. coli DH5\u03b1.Page 2 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nSaline Systems 2008, 4:12 http:\/\/www.salinesystems.org\/content\/4\/1\/12\nPage 3 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nEctoine biosynthesis and ectABC gene cluster from Marinococcus halophilusFigur 1\nEctoine biosynthesis and ectABC gene cluster from Marinococcus halophilus.

Transcription is initiated 29\nbp upstream of the start codon for ectC, 44 bp for ectB and\nprobably 114 bp for ectA (Fig 3). In the case of ectA, exper-\nimental proof of the predicted transcription initiation site\nposed a problem as resulting cDNA fragments were termi-\nnated 89 bp upstream of the start codon (|** in Fig. 3A).\nNo suitable promoter sequence was found in this region.\nEven though the experimental characterization of a tran-\nscription initiation site upstream of ectA was not success-\nful, we were able to reveal the likely initiation site shown\nin Fig. 3A from the data available. Louis and Galinski [7]\nwere able to demonstrate that a deletion 146 bp upstream\nof the start codon (shaded area in Fig. 3) resulted in unreg-\nulated ectoine production in E. coli XL1-Blue pOSM16. In\nthis work we demonstrated, using DH5\u03b1 pOSM2, that a\ndeletion 100 bp upstream of the start codon ( pOSM2 in\nFig. 3A) completely disabled transcription of ectA. From\nthis we concluded a promoter region beyond 100 bp and\nsomewhere around 150 bp upstream of ectA, probably\nidentical to the \u03c3A-dependent site identified for M. halo-\nphilus. (Fig. 3A). This proposal is corroborated by the find-\ning that the deletion in pOSM16 changes the first two\nthymidine nucleotides (TT) of the sequence of the poten-\ntial \u03c370-dependent -35 region TTGAAA (Fig. 3A). The con-\nsensus sequence for this -35 region is TTGACA [25].\nGrowth and ectoine production of genetically engineered \nE. coli\nPlasmid pOSM12 carries a 3.5 kb DNA fragment from M.\nhalophilus containing the ectoine biosynthetic genes\nectABC and a putative promoter region (ectUp) 720 bp\nupstream of ectA, whereas on pOSM2 this upstream\nregion is deleted 100 bp short of ectA and substituted by a\nlac promoter (Fig. 1B). Expression of the ectoine biosyn-\nthetic genes ectABC in E. coli DH5\u03b1 using both pOSM12\nand pOSM2, the latter supplemented with IPTG, led to an\naccumulation of ectoine in the cells (Fig. 4). The amount\nof intracellular ectoine increased with salinity of the\ngrowth medium in both cases but appeared to be slightly\nlower in the strain DH5\u03b1 pOSM2. The most obvious dif-\nference was that the E. coli construct devoid of the pro-\nmoter region (pOSM2) was unable to grow at 5% NaCl\n(Fig. 4). The levels of ectoine accumulation were, how-\never, always lower than those of the control strain (DH5\u03b1\npHSG575) in the presence of externally supplied ectoine\n(Fig. 4).\nNorthern blot analysisFigur  2\nNorthern blot analysis.

In the latter, ectoine accumulation increased up to a\nsalinity of 3% to a final value of approx. 0.4 mmol (g dry\nweight)-1, which then remained constant at salinities\nbetween 3 and 5% NaCl, resulting in a strong promotion\nof cell growth (Fig. 5). Comparison with Halomonas elon-\ngata, an extremely halotolerant ectoine-producing bacte-\nrium, revealed that the intracellular ectoine levels were\nsimilar up to 3% NaCl but approximately 1.5-fold higher\nin H. elongata at 5% NaCl (data not shown). This indicates\nthat E. coli DH5\u03b1, when grown in an ectoine-containing\nmedium, is able to establish the required ectoine levels in\na salinity range of 1\u20133% NaCl through uptake mecha-\nnism, but not at higher salinities. The heterologous\nectoine production, on the other hand, appears to be\nrestricted, leading to markedly lower ectoine levels in the\ncells (Fig. 4).\nThe comparatively low ectoine levels in recombinant E.\ncoli DH5\u03b1 pOSM12 could not be explained by limitation\nof the cells' capacity because the ectoine-accumulating\ncontrol strain tolerated higher intracellular ectoine con-\ncentrations nor by leakage because ectoine was not detect-\nable in the medium (HPLC sensitivity limit: 10 \u03bcM). In\naddition, higher cytoplasmatic ectoine levels caused a sig-\nnificant growth-promotion of the control strain and\nappeared to have no negative effect on the cells. We there-\nfore assumed that regulatory mechanisms in the metabo-\nlism of E. coli caused the limitation of ectoine production\nin the recombinant strains. To determine potential candi-\ndates for the limiting steps, the ectoine biosynthetic path-\nway had to be analyzed in context with E. coli's metabolic\nnetwork, where L-aspartate \u03b2-semialdehyde, the substrate\nof the first enzyme of the ectoine biosynthetic pathway, is\nan intermediate of the biosynthetic pathway of the amino\nacids of the aspartate family (Fig. 1A). As E. coli has three\naspartate kinase activities (I-III), which are regulated by\nfeedback inhibition and\/or transcriptional repression\n[26], we suspected a bottle-neck for the supply of this met-\nabolic precursor in E. coli DH5\u03b1 pOSM12.\nRole of aspartate kinases in ectoine synthesis\nIn order to obtain more information about the presumed\nbottle-neck in E. coli DH5\u03b1 pOSM12, growth experiments\nat 3% NaCl were performed in the presence of the end\nproducts and regulators of the synthesis of the aspartate\nfamily amino acids: L-lysine, L-threonine and L-methio-\nnine (each 1 mM). In the presence of these amino acids,\nectoine biosynthesis was significantly reduced, leading to\nan almost complete inhibition by a mixture of all three\namino acids (Fig. 6). In contrast, the addition of L-aspar-\ntate (1 mM), the substrate of the aspartate kinases, or its\nprecursor fumarate (1 mM) to the growth medium\nresulted in 2.3-fold and 1.4-fold elevated ectoine levels,\nrespectively. Higher L-aspartate or fumarate concentra-\ntions in the medium did not cause a further increase in\nectoine production. As expected, the enhancing effect of\naspartate or fumarate on ectoine biosynthesis was again\nIntracellular ectoine content (heterologous production vs. uptak )Figur  4\nIntracellular ectoine content (heterologous produc-\ntion vs. uptake).

Our strategy\nto relieve this metabolic restriction was to alter the regula-\ntion of the biosynthetic pathway by co-expression of the\nectoine biosynthetic genes together with the feedback-\ninsensitive aspartate kinase (lysC) from C. glutamicum\nMH20-22B, which had already been successfully\nexpressed in E. coli [27,28].\nThe plasmid pAKECT1 (Fig. 7) contains lysC under the\ncontrol of a tac promoter and the gene cluster ectABC with\nthe putative osmoregulated promoter sequence upstream\nof ectA (ectUp), just as in pOSM12. The possibility to sep-\narately induce the ectoine biosynthetic genes by osmotic\nstress and the aspartate kinase by IPTG enabled us to\ndirectly investigate the effect of the deregulated aspartate\nkinase on growth rates and ectoine production. As shown\nin Fig. 5, induction of aspartate kinase increased the\ngrowth rate at low salinity (1% and 2% NaCl) to the same\nlevel as the control. Without IPTG-induction of the feed-\nback-insensitive aspartate kinase gene the ectoine levels in\nthe cells were similar to those in DH5\u03b1 pOSM12, but\nupon addition of IPTG, ectoine production increased\napprox. 3-fold in the range of 1\u20133% NaCl and reached a\nmaximum of 0.4 mmol (g dry weight)-1, which remained\nrelatively constant at salinities of 3% NaCl, to 5% NaCl\n(Fig. 8). The observed saturation level at 3% NaCl and\nhigher perfectly correlated with the levels achieved by\nectoine uptake from the growth medium (Fig. 4). This\nobservation provides strong evidence that we succeeded\nin by-passing the regulatory mechanisms which caused\nthe metabolic restriction for ectoine production in recom-\nbinant E. coli DH5\u03b1.\nEnzymatic activity of the aspartate kinases\nThe enzyme assay for aspartate kinases proved the pres-\nence of a feedback-insensitive aspartate kinase from C.\nglutamicum MH20-22B (Table 1).

The fact that aspartate kinase activity\nin E. coli DH5\u03b1 pAKECT1 is the same, both in the pres-\nence and absence of the inhibitors (L-lysine and L-threo-\nnine) indicates that a deregulated aspartate kinase from C.\nglutamicum leads to increased levels of aspartate family\namino acids, and that as a consequence, the contribution\nof E. coli aspartate kinases I, II and III is insignificant,\nprobably due to complete inhibition\/repression under\nthese conditions.\nDiscussion\nTranscription of ectoine genes in M. halophilus and \nrecombinant E. coli DH5\u03b1\nData on transcription regulation are still rare for halo-\nphilic eubacteria, but have been investigated in detail for\nthe Gram-positive non-halophilic model organism Bacil-\nlus subtilis, and, of course, E. coli. Transcription of genes\nessential for cell survival during exponential growth is\ncontrolled by the primary sigma factors \u03c3A and \u03c370, respec-\ntively, which recognize a promoter consensus sequence\ncomprising a -35 region TTGACA, a spacer of 16\u201318\nnucleotides and a -10 region TATAAT [25]. Of the three\n\u03c3A\/\u03c370 promoters identified in this study, only the one\nupstream of ectB (ATGACA-N18-TATTAT) had previously\nbeen identified by Louis & Galinski [7], because the other\ntwo (TTGAAA-N17-TAAGCT and TCGACT-N17-TATGAT)\ndeviated by 4 and 3 nucleotides, respectively, from the\nconsensus sequence.\nGeneral stress response, on the other hand, is mediated by\nthe alternative sigma factor \u03c3B in Bacillus subtilis (among\nother Gram-positive bacteria) and \u03c3S in E. coli [29,30].

For \u03c3S-dependent pro-\nmoters in E. coli Espinosa-Urgel et al. [32] proposed a -10\nregion CTATACT, which is only slightly different from the\n-10 region recognized by \u03c370. A conserved -35 region\ncould not be defined so far, but an intrinsic curvature in\nthis region is proposed to compensate for it. Due to these\nmarked differences it is rather unlikely that a genuine \u03c3B-\ndependent promoter of a Gram-positive bacterium\nshould be recognized by the Gram-negative E. coli.\nIn earlier work Louis and Galinski [7] could not resolve\nthe question whether the three ectoine biosynthetic genes\n(ectA, ectB, ectC) are transcribed separately or as a single\noperon. Using the RACE method we have now shown that\nthey are transcribed both as single genes and as mRNA's\ncomprising ectAB, ectBC and possibly ectABC in M. halo-\nphilus (not shown). Heterologous expression of the\nectoine gene cluster in E. coli, also resulted in single and\ndouble gene mRNA products.\nWe have shown here the successful expression of the\nectoine biosynthesis genes ectA, ectB and ectC (as well as\nectAB and ectBC) from the Gram-positive M. halophilus in\nthe Gram-negative E. coli. This is explained by recognition\nof all three \u03c3A-dependent promoters preceeding individ-\nual genes of the ectoine biosynthesis gene cluster of M.\nhalophilus. Due to the conformity of the consensus\nsequence of \u03c3A- and \u03c370-dependent promoters this result\nis not surprising. In addition to the \u03c3A-dependent promot-\ners, a \u03c3B-dependent promoter for the transcription of\nectAB (and possibly ectABC) could be characterized\nupstream of ectA, suggesting that transcription of the sin-\ngle and the multiple gene products is initiated via different\nregulatory mechanisms in the donor M. halophilus. This\npromoter recognition sequence (GTTTGT-N13-AGGTAT)\ndeviates by 3 nucleotides from the consensus sequence\nand had, therefore, previously not been recognized by\nLouis and Galinski [7]. A potential \u03c3B-dependent pro-\nmoter 280 bp upstream of ectA, which was proposed by\nLouis and Galinski [7], is apparently not involved in the\nregulation of transcription of ectoine genes under the\nexperimental conditions employed. Use of the \u03c3B-\ndependent promoter by recombinant E. coli was neither\ndemonstrated nor to be expected. Due to the similarity of\nthe \u03c3S-dependent -10 region CTATACT to a \u03c370-dependent\npromoter, it cannot be stated without further investiga-\ntion, e.g. by sigma-factor binding studies, whether tran-\nscription of ectoine biosynthetic genes in E. coli is under\ncontrol of \u03c370, \u03c3S or an interplay of both. In addition it has\nalready been shown in several studies that \u03c370-dependent\npromoters could also be recognized by \u03c3S [33,34], and a\nregulatory interplay of \u03c370 and \u03c3S, based on changes in\nbinding affinity affected by global regulatory factors, was\nproposed [35,36].\nRecent work on Bacillus pasteurii has shown that the\nectABC genes are organised in a single operon in this\norganism. Expression of ectoine genes was only observed\nwhen cells were grown at elevated osmolarity and a single\ngene transcript (2.6 kb) and a typical \u03c3A-dependent pro-\nmotor region were identified [37]. Unfortunately upshock\nexperiments were not conducted, hence the possibility\nstill remains that an additional stress response promoter\n(\u03c3B-dependent) may also be involved in the organism's\nshort-term adaptation. In contrast to B. pasteurii (a halo-\ntolerant species) M. halophilus is a true halophile with a\ngrowth optimum at around 2 M salt. It is therefore not\nsurprising that its salt stress response strategies are appar-\nently more complex.\nIn a comprehensive promoter analysis of the ectoine gene\ncluster in Chromohalobacter salexigens (member of the\nHalomonadaceae) four putative transcription initiation\nsites were identified, at 44, 96, 134 and 149 bp upstream\nof the ectA start codon. Two of these were of the \u03c370-type,\none probably \u03c3S and a fourth promoter with no similarity\nto known sigma factors. Consequently, the authors con-\ncluded the existence of a complex regulation pattern of\nectoine synthesis in this true halophile [38].\nThe observation of osmoregulated ectoine production in\nE. coli DH5\u03b1 pOSM12 could of course result from post-\ntranscriptional regulation, including for example control-\nled uptake and\/or excretion. However, as both transport\nsystems for ectoine (ProP and ProU) are functional in E.\ncoli DH5\u03b1 pOSM12 and ectoine was not detected in the\nmedium (at 10 \u03bcM sensitivity), we propose that ectoine\nsynthesis is, at least partly, controlled at the level of\nenzyme activity. Still, the inability of E. coli DH5\u03b1 pOSM2\nto transcribe ectA and ectAB in the absence of IPTG and\nectAB even under IPTG-induction, as well its impaired\nectoine production, stresses the importance of the DNA\nregion upstream of ectA (ectUp) for controlled expression\nof the ectoine biosynthesis genes. A transcriptional fusion\nof this promoter region (ectUp) with the reporter gene gfp\nwas shown to be osmotically induced in E. coli and, more\nimportantly, down-regulated in the presence of externally\nsupplied compatible solutes [39]. The promoter region\nupstream of ectA, therefore, appears to sense a regulatory\nsignal, apparently common for both the Gram-positive M.\nhalophilus and the Gram-negative E. coli.\nOpening up of a metabolic bottle-neck for ectoine \nproduction\nSuccessful heterologous expression of the ectoine biosyn-\nthetic genes from the halophilic M. halophilus in E. coli\nXL1-Blue by Louis and Galinski [7] enabled us for the firstPage 10 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nSaline Systems 2008, 4:12 http:\/\/www.salinesystems.org\/content\/4\/1\/12time to utilize genetically engineered strains for ectoine\nproduction. However, as E. coli XL1-Blue in medium\nMM63 displayed a narrow salinity range (1\u20133% NaCl)\nand growth rates were by a factor of 2\u20135 lower than with\nDH5\u03b1, experiments in this study were conducted with E.\ncoli DH5\u03b1. The pivotal role of E. coli aspartate kinases as a\nlimiting metabolic bottle-neck had been realised before,\nas shown by the use of E. coli feedback-insensitive aspar-\ntate kinase to enhance threonine production in transgenic\nalfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) [40]. The data presented here\nprove that stringent feedback-regulation and\/or transcrip-\ntional repression of the aspartate kinases in E. coli is in fact\nalso the main limiting factor for recombinant ectoine pro-\nduction in this host.\nWhen growth rates of E. coli DH5\u03b1 pAKECT1 are com-\npared to those of the control which accumulates ectoine\nfrom the medium (Fig. 5), one can see that the ectoine-\nsynthesizing construct has a 40% lower growth rate at 2%\nand 3% NaCl. This difference may be explained by energy\nrequirements and side-effects of a deregulated amino acid\nmetabolism within the aspartate family. However, as this\ndifference is diminished at higher salinities and com-\npletely abolished at 5% NaCl, one may conclude that, at\nthe upper range of salt tolerance, ectoine production in\nthe genetically engineered strain is equally efficient as\nectoine uptake and that growth-limitations caused by\noverexpression of foreign genes and overproduction of\naspartate family amino acids become less important.\nAs highest cytoplasmic ectoine concentrations (0.4 mmol\n(g dry weight)-1) were already achieved at a medium salin-\nity of only 3% NaCl, this could be seen as an opportunity\nfor ectoine production at comparatively low salt concen-\ntrations and relatively high growth rate (\u03bc = 0.21, td = 3.3\nh) [41]. Louis and Galinski [7] have previously reported\nsimilar cytoplasmic ectoine levels (0.38 mmol (g dry\nweight)-1) in recombinant E. coli XL1-Blue (containing\nplasmid pOSM11) at 3% NaCl. This strain however has a\nmuch lower growth rate (approx. 0.1) under the same\nconditions and appears to experience other growth-limit-\ning restrictions. In order to improve the space-time yield\nof heterologous ectoine production even further, future\nwork will address the option to combine the ectoine bio-\nsynthetic gene cluster with its corresponding genuine\naspartate kinase from M. halophilus. The chances are that\nthis enzyme will be feed-back regulated and\/or transcrip-\ntionally repressed when osmotic equilibrium is achieved.\nUnfortunately, this postulated gene has so far not been\nidentified in M. halophilus.\nCo-expression of ectoine biosynthetic genes from M. halo-\nphilus and feedback-insensitive aspartate kinase from C.\nglutamicum MH20-22B in E. coli DH5\u03b1 pAKECT1 resulted\nin strongly elevated ectoine levels, which correlated with\nthe levels obtained when ectoine was accumulated from\nthe growth medium (0.4 mmol (g dry weight)-1). A most\nimportant observation during all our studies with E. coli\nDH5\u03b1 pAKECT1 was that ectoine levels increased only up\nto 3% NaCl (as in accumulating cells) and that ectoine\nwas not detected in the growth medium at the end of the\nexperiments. In case of unregulated synthesis an efflux of\nthe overproduced ectoine via mechanosensitive channels\n(Msc) would have been conceivable [42-44]. The above\nconclusion appears to stand in contrast to the findings by\nSchubert et al. [45] who demonstrated continuous excre-\ntion of ectoine from a transgenic E. coli. The authors intro-\nduced the ectoine gene cluster from Chromohalobacter\nsalexigens (devoid of the promoter region) into E. coli\nDH5\u03b1 under the control of a tet promoter. Following a\nhigh-cell density fermentation to 20 g L-1 (cell dry weight)\nand subsequent induction, they observed continuous\nexcretion of ectoine at a rate of 2 mg g-1 h-1, while the cel-\nlular level of ectoine stayed low (5 mg (g dry weight)-1).\nSuch a low leakage rate would not have been detected\nunder the low-cell density conditions employed here.\nAnother experimental difference of the work reported\nhere, besides the different origin of the genes, is transcrip-\ntional control by the orginal promoter region (ectUp) and\nuse of growth conditions, under which compatible solute\nuptake systems are activated.\nIt is intriguing that ectoine levels were nearly identical in\naccumulating cells with ectoine in the growth medium,\nand in synthesizing cells harbouring pAKECT1. The only\nviable conclusion seems to be that heterologously\nexpressed ectoine biosynthetic enzymes of M. halophilus\nare, according to osmotic needs, tuned and regulated in\nthe phylogenetically distant host E. coli. This phenome-\nnon may be explained by allosteric regulation of gene\nproducts at the level of enzyme activity, caused by yet\nunkown general osmotic response mechanisms shared by\na large range of different bacteria.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated that a metabolic bottle-\nneck for ectoine production in the non-halophilic recom-\nbinant E. coli DH5\u03b1 can be relieved by coexpression of a\nderegulated aspartate kinase from C. glutamicum, and in\ndoing so we paved the way for alternative, economically\nviable production methods. The surprising observation,\nhowever, that heterologous expression of the ectoine bio-\nsynthetic genes does not lead to overproduction in the\nhost under the conditions employed, stresses the need to\ninvestigate regulatory mechanisms at enzyme level in\norder to disclose the biochemical signal which indicates\nosmotic balance to the cell.Page 11 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nSaline Systems 2008, 4:12 http:\/\/www.salinesystems.org\/content\/4\/1\/12Methods\nOrganisms, growth conditions and plasmids\nMarinococcus halophilus DSM 20408T was grown at 37\u00b0C\nin complex medium FP5 or FP10 consisting of 1.47% (w\/\nv) liquid fish peptone S490 (Primex AS, Norway), 10 g L-\n1 glucose \u00b7 H2O, 2 g L-1 NH4Cl, 0.5 g L-1 K2HPO4 and\neither 45 g L-1 NaCl and 5 g L-1 artificial sea salt (FP5) or\n90 g L-1 NaCl and 10 g L-1 artificial sea salt (FP10).

The amplified cDNA ends\nwere cloned into the plasmid pGEM\u00ae-T (Promega, Man-\nnheim, Germany) and sequenced by GATC (Koblenz,\nGermany).

Consequently,\nwe were able to separately induce ectoine synthesis via\nosmotic stress and deregulated aspartate kinase activity via\nisopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).\nAnalytical Methods\nApprox. 30 mg of freeze-dried cell material from an expo-\nnentially growing shaking culture (medium MM63) was\nused for the extraction of intracellular solutes according to\na modification of the method of Bligh and Dyer [53] with\nmethanol\/chloroform\/water (10:5:4) as described previ-\nously [54]. The cell extracts were analysed by isocratic\nHPLC using a GromSil\u00ae aminopropyl column (Grom,\nHerrenberg, Germany) and acetonitrile\/water (75:25 v\/v)\nat a flow rate of 1 ml min-1 as the mobile phase. For 13C-\nNMR analysis of cell extracts 1.5 g freeze-dried cell mate-\nrial was processed as above. The polar phase was evapo-\nrated to dryness at 70\u00b0C and dissolved in 1 ml D2O\nsupplemented with 10 mg 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionic\nacid sodium salt (TMSP) as an internal reference and 30 \u03bcl\nacetonitrile as internal standard. 1H -decoupled 13C-NMR\nspectra relative to TMSP were recorded in pulsed Fourier-\ntransform (FT) mode on a Bruker ARX 400 spectrometer\noperating at 100.62 MHz (13C) and 400 MHz for the pro-\nton channel.\nEnzyme assays\nAspartate kinase was assayed in extracts of cells resus-\npended in 50 mM (NH4)2SO4, 50 mM triethanolamine, 5\nmM dithioerythritol, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5 according to the\nmethod described by Black and Wright [55].
