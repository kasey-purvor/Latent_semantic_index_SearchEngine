INTRODUCTION\nThe identification of excited-state properties of 21Mg is\ncrucial for the description of the 20Na(p, \u03b3 )21Mg reaction that\nis important for hydrogen burning in explosive scenarios such\nas x-ray bursts [1]. In a recent resonant 20Na+p scattering\nexperiment by Ref. [2], the spins and proton widths of\nsome excited states above the proton threshold of Sp =\n3226 keV [3] have been determined, and a good correspon-\ndence between shell-model calculations and measurements in\nthe region above 4 MeV has been achieved [2]. Based on this\nagreement it was recommended to include states predicted\nby the shell model just above the proton threshold in the\n20Na(p, \u03b3 )21Mg reaction rate calculations, states for which\nthe experimental evidence is less conclusive; in particular spin\nassignments are lacking. Also, the spectroscopic factors for the\nbound states are included in the reaction rate calculations, as\nthe direct capture rates to bound states of 21Mg are scaled\nby the one-proton spectroscopic factors of the states [1].\nThese spectroscopic factors must be taken from calculations,\nof which shell-model calculations in the p-sd shell are at\npresent the most reliable. However, below the 21Mg proton-\nseparation energy, inconsistencies between experimental and\ntheoretical level assignments have been reported [2]. These\ninconsistencies warrant clarification in light of the importance\nof the shell-model input to the astrophysical reaction-rate\ncalculations.\nThe structure of 21Mg has previously been probed in the\nthree-neutron-transfer reaction, 24Mg(3He,6He)21Mg [4\u20137],\nand several states have been identified. In the most recent\nexperiment, restrictions on spin and parity for some bound\nand unbound states were deduced from the measured angular\ndistributions in the transfer reaction [4]. The excited-state\n*diget@nscl.msu.edu\nproperties of 21Mg were evaluated by Ref. [8] and are shown in\nFig. 1(c) for levels below or near the proton threshold. This\nlevel scheme for 21Mg is also compared to the excitation\npattern of the mirror nucleus 21F [Fig. 1(a)]. For 21Mg, the spin\nand parity of the first excited state has been determined unam-\nbiguously. For several other states below the proton threshold,\nhowever, the identification of spin and parity is not unique and\nthe final assignments are largely based on comparison with\nthe mirror nucleus. This is the case for the states around 1 and\n2 MeV, for which the experimental assignments were\nconsistent with the properties of the mirror nucleus but not\nuniquely determined from the existing data. The experimental\nspin and parity assignment for the 1649-keV state, however,\nthough not unique, was inconsistent with the well-known\nproperties of the corresponding states in the mirror\nnucleus.\nThe measured level scheme of 21Mg may furthermore be\ncompared to shell-model calculations. The p-sd shell model\nis well established in this region of the nuclear chart, and\none would expect good agreement between experiment and\ncalculations. Figure 1(b) shows the 21Mg level scheme as\ncalculated in the shell model using the NUSHELL@MSU code\n[9] with the WBP effective interaction [10]. The model space\nof s-p-sd-pf is truncated to 0h\u00af \u03c9(sd shell) for positive-parity\nstates and 1h\u00af \u03c9 for negative-parity states. The wave functions\nfor low-lying negative parity states in 21Mg are dominated\nby configurations with a single hole in the p shell. (The\n0h\u00af \u03c9 obtained with the recent USDA and USDB sd-shell\ninteractions [11] are similar to those for WBP that contained\nthe original USD interaction for the sd-shell part.) A striking\nobservation is that the experimentally proposed properties\n[Fig. 1(c)] of the 1649-keV state (J\u03c0 = 1\/2\u2212, 3\/2\u2212) could\nnot be reproduced by the p-sd shell-model calculations. In this\nenergy region, only a 9\/2+, 3\/2+ energy doublet is predicted\nby theory, states that have not been identified experimentally in\n21Mg, though\u2014as seen in Fig. 1(a)\u2014the doublet is known in\nthe mirror nucleus 21F.

Experimental level schemes for the mirror nuclei 21F (a) and 21Mg (c) [8], compared to results from a WBP shell-model calculation\n(b). In (d) we show the 21Mg decay scheme as proposed in the present work. All energies are in MeV, only states below 3.7 MeV are shown.\nexperiment is important to address to determine the reliability\nof the shell-model calculations and\u2014if possible\u2014justify their\nuse in the calculation of astrophysical reaction rates in this\nmass region in general and for the 20Na(p, \u03b3 )21Mg reaction in\nparticular. Another notable feature is a significant energy shift\nfor the 1\/2+ first excited state in the A = 21 mirror nuclei,\nE(1\/2+) = 200 keV in 21Mg, and E(1\/2+) = 280 keV in 21F.\nIn the present article we report on the first study of\n21Mg with \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy. Excited states in this nu-\ncleus were populated in the one-neutron knockout reaction\n9Be(22Mg,21Mg+\u03b3 )X at 73.8 MeV\/nucleon. Cross sections\nfor the knockout leading to individual final states in 21Mg were\nmeasured. From these, spectroscopic factors were extracted\nwith the help of reaction theory formulated in the eikonal\nand sudden approximations [12,13]. Our new experimental\nresults are compared to shell-model calculations using the\nWBP effective interaction.\nIn the following, the experimental method will be intro-\nduced (Sec. II), and the results will be discussed (Sec. III) in\ncomparison to shell-model calculations and the mirror nucleus.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD\nDirect one-nucleon knockout reactions from intermediate-\nenergy rare-isotope beams have been established as a precision\nspectroscopic tool to assess the single-particle properties of\nshort-lived, exotic nuclei [14,15]. On surface collision with a\nlight target, typically 9Be, a nucleon is removed and single-hole\nstates are selectively populated in the projectile-like residue.\n\u03b3 -ray spectroscopy is used to identify the final state and to\ndetermine the cross section for the population of individual\nstates. The shape of the parallel momentum distribution of\nthe projectile-like knockout residues depends on the orbital\nangular momentum of the knocked-out nucleon (\u0004 value) [14,\n16,17].\nThe reaction 9Be(22Mg,21Mg)X populates one-neutron-\nhole states in 21Mg relative to the 22Mg ground state. With\n10 neutrons in 22Mg, sd-shell single-neutron states relative to\n20Mg are populated if one of the two sd-shell valence neutrons\nis removed, or alternatively, if a neutron is knocked-out from\nwithin the N = 8 core, negative-parity neutron-hole states are\npopulated in 21Mg.\nA. Beam production\nThe radioactive 22Mg beam was produced at the Coupled-\nCyclotron Facility at NSCL [18], on the campus of Michigan\nState University. This secondary beam was produced by\nfragmentation of a 150 MeV\/nucleon 36Ar primary beam\nimpinging on an 893 mg\/cm2 9Be target located at the\nmidacceptance target position of the A1900 fragment sep-\narator [19]. The fragments were separated in the A1900\nseparator using a 300-mg\/cm2 achromatic aluminum wedge\nin conjunction with momentum slits at 0.5% momentum\nacceptance at the A1900 dispersive image. This yielded a\nsecondary cocktail beam with 24Si, 23Al, 22Mg, 21Na, 20Ne, and\n19F components. The individual constituents of the cocktail\nbeam were distinguished on an event-by-event basis from\nthe time-of-flight measured between two plastic scintillators\nlocated before the reaction target and separated by about\n25 m. This yielded an unambiguous identification of the\nincoming 22Mg projectiles as described in Ref. [20], where\nthe same experimental setup and cocktail beam was used for\nthe investigation of 20Mg in the two-neutron knockout reaction\nfrom 22Mg.\nB. Reaction product identi\ufb01cation\nThe secondary beam impinged upon the 188-mg\/cm2 9Be\nreaction target placed at the target position of the S800\n064309-2\nSTRUCTURE OF EXCITED STATES IN 21Mg . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 064309 (2008)\nspectrograph [21]. The spectrograph was operated in focus\nmode, where the beam is momentum focused onto the reaction\ntarget. The beam energy at midtarget for the 22Mg beam was\n73.8 MeV\/nucleon. With the focal-plane detectors [22] of\nthe spectrograph, the reaction residues were identified and\ncharacterized event by event. The energy loss was measured\nwith the ionization chamber of the S800 focal-plane detector\nsystem [22]. The residue\u2019s time-of-flight through the S800\nspectrograph was determined using the S800 focal-plane trig-\nger plastic scintillator in conjunction with a timing scintillator\npositioned upstream from the reaction target at the object\nposition of the spectrograph. From position measurements\nperformed with the two position-sensitive cathode readout\ndrift chambers (CRDCs) in the S800 focal plane, the residue\u2019s\nflight path through the spectrograph was reconstructed event\nby event using the optics code COSY [23] in conjunction with\nthe known magnet settings of the spectrograph. With this, the\nparallel momentum distribution of the knockout residues was\nreconstructed from the ion\u2019s measured position in the S800\nfocal plane.\nThe trajectory reconstruction also allowed for the correction\nof the time-of-flight and of the energy loss so that a very clean\nparticle identification could be obtained. The particle identifi-\ncation for residues produced by incoming 22Mg projectiles is\nshown in Fig. 2.\nC. \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy\nThe secondary target was surrounded by the segmented\ngermanium array SeGA [24]. With SeGA, prompt \u03b3 rays\nwere measured in coincidence with the projectile-like residues\nidentified in the S800 spectrograph. The array was equipped\nwith sixteen 32-fold segmented high-purity-germanium detec-\ntors. Efficiency and energy calibrations were performed with\nstandard 57Co, 152Eu, and 226Ra sources yielding a relative\nuncertainty on the absolute scale of the efficiency of 5%.\nFIG. 2. (Color online) Particle identification of reaction residues\nin coincidence with incoming 22Mg secondary beam particles. The\nidentification was achieved using the S800 focal-plane detectors [22]\nas described in the text. The gate used as identification of the N =\n9, Z = 12 21Mg reaction residue is shown.\nIn the configuration used for the present measurement,\nSeGA consists of a forward ring at 37\u25e6 and a ring at 90\u25e6 with\nrespect to the beam axis composed of seven and nine detectors,\nrespectively. This forward-focused geometry is optimized for\nin-beam \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy with fast beams as it takes ad-\nvantage of the Lorentz boost of the \u03b3 -ray distribution emitted\nfrom fast-moving nuclei. The segmentation of SeGA is used\nto event-by-event Doppler reconstruct the \u03b3 rays emitted by\nthe knockout residues in flight. A full-width-at-half-maximum\nenergy resolution of 25 keV at 900 keV was achieved. The\nSeGA configuration used here yielded a photopeak efficiency\nof 2.5% at 900 keV for a stationary source and a corresponding\nin-beam efficiency of 3% with the Lorentz boost of the \u03b3 -ray\ndistribution taken into account.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. In-beam \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy\nWith complete particle identification in the incoming and\nall exit channels, the \u03b3 rays emitted in the 9Be(22Mg,21Mg)X\nreaction were selectively measured. The Doppler-corrected\n\u03b3 -ray spectrum is shown in Fig. 3, where five \u03b3 -ray transitions\nare identified and labeled with their energy. The region below\nthe strong 888-keV transition in the spectrum shows only\nthe corresponding Compton continuum and no evidence for\nadditional photopeaks at lower energy was found.\nIt is evident from comparison to Fig. 1(c), that the\nenergies of all five \u03b3 -ray peaks are consistent with the\nE (keV)\n500 1000 1500 2000\nCo\nun\nts\n \/ \n16\n k\neV\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n88\n3 \nke\nV\n14\n51\n k\neV\n16\n51\n k\neV\n17\n87\n k\neV\n19\n89\n k\neV\nMg)X21Mg,22Be(9\nFIG. 3.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 064309 (2008)\npreviously proposed level scheme. The most intense transition\ncorresponds to the decay of the 1084-keV state to the 201-keV\n1\/2+ state, whereas the other, weaker transitions are attributed\nto the decays of two higher-lying states to the 5\/2+ ground\nstate and to the 1\/2+ first excited state. With these assignments\nof \u03b3 -ray transitions, the energies of the bound excited states\nare measured with better precision than previously achieved\nin particle spectroscopy [1651(4) keV and 1989(3) keV,\nrespectively].\nThe energy of the 1\/2+ first excited state is found from\nenergy differences of \u03b3 -ray transitions from the 1651(4) and\n1989(3)-keV states to the ground state and the first excited\nstates, respectively. This yields the most precise individual\nmeasurement of this level energy so far with an energy\ndetermined to be 201(4) keV. The \u03b3 decay of the 1\/2+ state\ncould not possibly be observed in an in-beam experiment, as\nthe low decay energy and the E2 character of the transition\nto the 5\/2+ ground state make the state isomeric. With\nthe energy difference between the two mirror states taken\ninto account, the isomeric nature of the 21Mg 1\/2+ state\nis predicted from the corresponding mirror-state half-life of\n6.1(6) ns [8]. From this\u2014assuming the transition matrix\nelements to be identical for the two mirror transitions and\nknowing the E2 character of the transition\u2014the half-life of\nthe 1\/2+ state in 21Mg is estimated to be approximately 32 ns.\nThis leaves the state to decay on average 5.2 m downstream\nof the reaction target, far beyond the reach of SeGA. The\npreviously adopted level energy [8] is the result of a weighted\naverage of several existing measurements based on particle\nspectroscopy.\nThe question arises whether the significant energy shift\nobserved for the 1\/2+ state can be attributed to the Thomas-\nEhrman effect [25,26]. The occupancies of the s1\/2 orbital\n(calculated with the shell model using the USDB effective\ninteraction) for the 5\/2+, 1\/2+, and 3\/2+ states are all similar,\n0.50, 0.37, and 0.35, respectively. In addition, the average s1\/2\norbital separation energies are all about 7.0 MeV. Thus, we do\nnot expect a large Thomas-Ehrman shift. Charge-dependent\ntwo-body interactions contributing to energy shifts in mirror\nnuclei were considered in Ref. [27]. In Table 5 of [27] the\nb coefficients for the isobaric mass multiplet equation for the\n5\/2+ and 1\/2+ states are predicted to be 4.402 and 4.403 MeV,\nrespectively, and we have calculated the value for 3\/2+ to\nbe 4.386 MeV (for isospin T = 3\/2 the b coefficient is the\nbinding energy difference divided by three). These can be\ncompared to the experimental values of 4.435(5), 4.408(5),\nand 4.408(14) MeV, respectively. The error for the 5\/2+\nground-state coefficient is from the experimental uncertainty\nof 0.016 MeV in the 21Mg ground-state binding energy. The\nagreement is reasonable compared to the average rms obtained\nfor b coefficients in this mass region of 27 keV from Table II\nof Ref. [27]. In terms of the excited state energy shifts, the\nexperimental results for 1\/2+ and 3\/2+ are \u22120.080(4) and\n\u22120.080(13) MeV compared to the calculated values of 0.002\nand \u22120.052 MeV, respectively.\nThe measurement of the first-excited-state energy allows\nfor an identification of the energy of the second excited state\n[1084(4) keV], again found to be consistent with the previous\nmeasurements but superior in precision. The \u03b3 -ray energies\nTABLE I. Given are excitation energies Ex , spin and parity\nassignments J \u03c0i , the measured \u03b3 -ray transition energies E\u03b3 , the final\nstate populated in the decay J \u03c0f , and the branching ratios for the \u03b3\ndecays to the 5\/2+ ground state and the 1\/2+ first excited state.

The experimental branching ratios are summarized in\nTable I and discussed below.\nFor the 1084-keV state, only a decay to the 1\/2+ state is\nseen, which\u2014together with the previous determination of its\n\u0004 = 1 orbital angular momentum [4]\u2014favors an assignment\nof J\u03c0 = 1\/2\u2212 over J\u03c0 = 3\/2\u2212, consistent with the mirror\nnucleus and shell-model predictions [Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)]. This\nconclusion is further strengthened by the good correspondence\nbetween the observed and calculated cross sections, as will be\ndescribed in Sec. III B.\nThe decay pattern of the 1989-keV state is quite different as\nthis state with \u0004 = 1 assignment [4] decays to the 5\/2+ ground\nstate as well as to the 1\/2+ first excited state. The state is thus\nhighly unlikely to have spin and parity J\u03c0 = 1\/2\u2212 because the\nsuppression of M2, E3 multipolarity would strongly hinder\nthe \u03b3 decay to the ground state. We therefore assign spin and\nparity J\u03c0 = 3\/2\u2212 to the state at 1989 keV.\nSimilarly for the 1651-keV state\u2014with previously pro-\nposed assignment of J\u03c0 = 1\/2\u2212, 3\/2\u2212 [8]\u2014the observed\ndecay to the 5\/2+ ground state excludes a spin-parity as-\nsignment of J\u03c0 = 1\/2\u2212 and the assignment of J\u03c0 = 3\/2\u2212 is\nstrongly favored. From the three-neutron transfer experiment,\n\u0004 = 1 orbital angular momentum was assigned based on the\nassumption that only a single state at this energy was populated\nin the 24Mg(3He,6He)21Mg transfer reaction [4]. According\nto the shell-model calculation and the data from the mirror\nnucleus, however, an additional state, possibly with spin and\nparity 9\/2+, may be present at this excitation energy. The\nenergy difference might be too small to be resolved in the\nreaction studies that rely on particle detection. This possibility\nwas not considered in the discussion of the previous transfer\nexperiment, and positive parity should not be excluded for this\nstate. In the case of positive parity, 1\/2+, 3\/2+, and 5\/2+ states\nwould be possible withM1 orE2 transitions to the ground state\n064309-4\nSTRUCTURE OF EXCITED STATES IN 21Mg . . .

Of these, J\u03c0 = 3\/2+ is the only\npossibility consistent with the mirror nucleus and is therefore\nfavored. Experimentally, however, the only J\u03c0 assignment\nthat could be excluded was 1\/2\u2212. We note that, in contrast\nto the previous three-neutron transfer experiment of Ref. [4],\nthe possibility of a complex-structure, collective 9\/2+ excited\nstate does not affect the experiment presented here, because\nsuch a state would be populated only in a higher-order process\n(e.g., in the knockout from an excited state of the projectile),\nwhich is an unlikely two-step process that, to our knowledge,\nhas not been observed in 9Be-induced one-nucleon knockout\nreactions to date.\nB. Cross sections\nThe inclusive cross section for the knockout reaction\n9Be(22Mg,21Mg)X was determined to \u03c3 = 19.7(16) mb. The\nobservables and uncertainties that enter the cross-section\ncalculation are the number of 22Mg projectiles (relative\nuncertainty: \u03b4 = 0.7%), the acceptance of the spectrograph\nfor the residual 21Mg nuclei (\u03b4 = 8%), the target thickness\n(\u03b4 = 2%), and the number of reaction residues (\u03b4 = 1%).\nFrom the \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy as described in the preceding\nsection, partial cross sections for the knockout to the three\nmeasured excited states are deduced assuming negligible\nfeeding to these states from unobserved, higher-lying states.\nThis assumption is justified, first, because no \u03b3 -ray transitions\nother than the ones already described are seen and, second,\nbecause high-energy \u03b3 rays (outside the dynamic range of\nthe \u03b3 -ray detectors) are very unlikely, because those would\ncorrespond to states well above the proton threshold, and thus\none would expect strongly competing proton decay branches.\nThe only bound state other than the observed that should\nbe accessible by one-neutron knockout is the 3086(15)-keV\nstate [4]. According to shell-model calculations, however, the\nknockout to possible states at 3 MeV will proceed with very\nsmall spectroscopic factors between 0.00 and 0.04, depending\non the structure of the state. This would correspond to a\nmeasured cross section of about 0.0\u20130.2 mb, assuming a\nreduction factor similar to that observed. This cross section\nwould correspond to about one-tenth of the intensity of the\nweakest observed \u03b3 -ray transitions (Fig. 3) and is thus below\nthe sensitivity limit of the present experiment, independent of\nthe \u03b3 -decay energy of the involved states. Furthermore, the\nbest estimate of the systematic uncertainty on the measured\npartial cross sections introduced by unobserved decays of\nhigher-lying states is therefore 0.1 mb, which is negligible\ncompared to other uncertainties (Table II) and the assumption\nof negligible feeding is thus justified. The measured partial\ncross sections to the second, third, and fourth excited states\nare listed in Table II along with the remaining measured cross\nsection, which has to be attributed to knockout to the ground\nstate and the first excited isomeric state.\nThe theoretical cross sections for the knockout to the\nindividual final states with quantum numbers J\u03c0 are calculated\nas:\n\u03c3th(Ex, J \u03c0 ) =\n(\nA\nA \u2212 1\n)N\nC2S(n\u0004j, J \u03c0 )\u03c3sp(n\u0004j, S \u2032n).\nHere the single-particle cross sections \u03c3sp(n\u0004j, S \u2032n) for the\nremoval of a neutron with quantum numbers n\u0004j depends on\nthe effective separation energy S \u2032n = Sn + Ex of the neutron\nrelative to the (excited) final state and is calculated by taking\ninto account the contributions from diffractive breakup as\nwell as stripping; the calculations employ the eikonal reaction\ntheory of Refs. [12\u201314] with potentials and input parameters\nrelated to nuclear sizes chosen as described in Refs. [28,29].\nThe spectroscopic factors C2S(n\u0004j, J \u03c0 ) describe the structural\noverlap between the initial- and final-state wave functions\u2014\nthe 22Mg ground state and the final state of 21Mg\u2014and\nare calculated with the shell-model code NUSHELL@MSU\n[9] using the WBP effective interaction [10]. Because the\nprojectile 22Mg has a 0+ ground state, only one term (n\u0004j )\ncontributes to the cross section for each final single-hole state.\nA center-of-mass correction [A\/(A \u2212 1)]N with N being the\nmajor oscillator quantum number (see Ref. [14] for more\ndetails) has been applied to the shell-model spectroscopic\nfactor. The extracted spectroscopic information is summarized\nin Table II.\nThe measured cross sections are significantly lower than\nthe calculated values that rely on the spectroscopic factors\nfrom the shell-model calculations. A reduction of experimental\nspectroscopic strengths to 60\u201370% of independent-particle\nmodel predictions has been established from electron-induced\nsingle-proton knockout reactions performed on stable nuclei\n[30] and is ascribed to a variety of correlation effects missing\nin the present effective-interaction theories [31,32].

Background-subtracted, acceptance-corrected momentum distributions for the one-neutron knockout to 21Mg. The inclusive\nmomentum distribution (a) and the momentum distributions for knockout to the 1084- and 1989-keV levels (b) and (c) are shown. Theoretical\ndistributions for orbital angular momenta \u0004 = 0, \u0004 = 1, and \u0004 = 2 are shown as dotted, dashed, and dot-dashed lines, respectively. For the\ninclusive momentum distribution the individual contributions are added according to the partial cross sections listed in Table II. In all cases,\nthe theoretical distributions are scaled to match the amplitude and centroid of the measured distribution.\nreduction down to 24% of the shell-model spectroscopic\nstrength has been found in the removal of strongly bound\nneutrons from proton-rich nuclei and a dependence of the\namount of the reduction on the asymmetry at the Fermi\nsurface has been discussed [28,33]. The reduction factor,\nRS = \u03c3exp\/\u03c3th, that quantifies this quenching is 0.35(3) for\nthe inclusive cross section of the knockout from 22Mg to\n21Mg and is given in Table II also for the removal leading to\nindividual final states of 21Mg. In all cases, the uncertainties are\nsolely experimental. To estimate the theoretical uncertainties,\nthe spectroscopic factors C2S for the 5\/2+, 1\/2+, and 3\/2+\nstates, have\u2014using the USDB interaction\u2014been calculated\nto 1.43, 0.38, and 0.08, respectively, yielding a difference of\n0.02\u20130.05 compared to the WBP calculations. The reduction\nfactors encountered in the present work are generally around\n0.35 and thus consistent with the trend, scale, and fluctuations\nof previous measurements where a strongly bound neutron\nis removed from an already neutron-deficient nucleus [33].\nThe only deviation is found for the 1651-keV state; the\nspectroscopic factor for this state, however, is very small and\none might\u2014in addition to the large experimental uncertainty\u2014\nexpect the relative theoretical uncertainty for the shell-model\ncalculation to be large.\nC. Momentum distributions\nThe shape of the parallel-momentum distribution of the\nresidual nucleus depends on the \u0004-value of the knocked-out\nnucleon and can thus be used to assign orbital angular\nmomentum quantum numbers to specific final states in the\nprojectile-like knockout residue (e.g., see Ref. [14]). The\ninclusive parallel-momentum distribution is shown in Fig. 4(a),\nwhere a correction from the (measured) angular acceptance of\nthe S800 spectrograph as a function of residue momentum\nhas been taken into account. The theoretical momentum\ndistributions have been calculated for knockout of nucleons\nfrom s, p, and d single-particle states using the method\ndescribed in Refs. [16,17]. For the comparison to the inclusive\nmomentum distribution, the calculated shapes have been added\naccording to the measured partial cross sections given in\nTable II, with the ratio of partial cross sections to the 1d5\/2\nand 2s1\/2 states taken from the theoretical calculation. The\nsum distribution is scaled to match the height and centroid of\nthe measured distribution, where the relative centroid shifts\nin Figs. 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c) were less than 10 MeV\/c. The\ncalculated and measured distributions are consistent but show\nthe same asymmetry in the measured distribution with en-\nhancement at low momenta as has been seen in previous knock-\nout experiments [29,34]. This asymmetry dominates below\n7.8 GeV\/c, as is apparent from Fig. 4(a). At high momenta\n(above 8.1 GeV\/c), an acceptance cut is observed, for which\nreason only data with parallel momentum between 7.8 and\n8.1 GeV\/c were included in the comparison to the theoretical\nmomentum profile (see Fig. 4). This acceptance cut dominated\nthe uncertainty in the calculation of the inclusive cross section\n(Sec. III B).\nThe momentum distributions for the knockout to the\n1084-keV level and the 1989-keV level have been extracted\nand are shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c). When excluding the\nlow-momentum tail as discussed above and taking into account\nthe high-momentum cutoff, it is seen that the momentum\ndistribution for the 1084-keV level suggests an \u0004 = 1 knock-\nout, confirming the previous assignment of a state from the\np shell [4]. The momentum distribution for the 1989-keV\nstate [Fig. 4(c)] is also consistent with the previous \u0004 = 1\nassignment by Ref. [4], but the uncertainty in the measured\ndistribution is too large to make a firm assignment based on\nthe present data. For the 1651-keV state the statistics and the\nbackground discrimination were not sufficiently good to allow\nfor an extraction of the momentum distribution.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn summary, we have performed in-beam \u03b3 -ray spec-\ntroscopy of 21Mg for the first time, using the 9Be(22Mg,21Mg)X\n064309-6\nSTRUCTURE OF EXCITED STATES IN 21Mg . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 064309 (2008)\none-neutron-knockout reaction at 74 MeV\/nucleon. Five\n\u03b3 -ray transitions have been identified in 21Mg. The resulting\nexcitation energies are consistent with previous particle spec-\ntroscopy data and the precision was improved significantly\nby the present experiment. The energy of the isomeric first\nexcited state was determined indirectly through \u03b3 -ray energy\ndifferences. Spin and parity assignments for higher excited\nstates in 21Mg have been constrained through the measurement\nof the \u03b3 -decay patterns. All spin assignments proposed here are\nconsistent with the states observed in the mirror nucleus 21F\nand with the WBP shell-model calculations; the assignment\nfrom experiment alone was not conclusive only for the\n1651-keV state. The inclusive cross section for the knockout\nreaction and the partial cross sections for the population of\nindividual final states were measured and found to agree with\nshell-model calculations and eikonal reaction theory when\ntaking into account the appropriate reduction factor. This\nagreement was found for all states when uncertainties were\ntaken into account.\nIn conclusion, the present experiment confirms the pre-\ndictions of shell-model calculations for 21Mg through mea-\nsurement of the low-lying level scheme. With the combined\nmeasurement of spins and spectroscopic factors, the agreement\nlends confidence to shell-model calculations for 21Mg as these\nare crucial input to calculations of the astrophysical rp-process\nreaction rates, in particular for the 20Na(p, \u03b3 )21Mg reaction\nrate.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the National Science Founda-\ntion under Grants PHY-0606007 and PHY-0555366 and the\nUnited Kingdom Science and Technology Facilities Council\n(STFC) under Grant EP\/D003628.\n[1] M.
