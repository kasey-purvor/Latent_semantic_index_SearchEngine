Somites are transient blocks of cells that form sequentially along the antero-pos-\nterior axis of vertebrate embryos. They give rise to the vertebrae, ribs and other associated\nfeatures of the trunk. In this work we develop and analyse a mathematical formulation of a\nversion of the Clock and Wavefront model for somite formation, where the clock controls\nwhen the boundaries of the somites form and the wavefront determines where they form. Our\nanalysis indicates that this interaction between a segmentation clock and a wavefront can\nexplain the periodic pattern of somites observed in normal embryos. We can also show that\na simplification of the model provides a mechanism for predicting the anomalies resulting\nfrom perturbation of the wavefront.\n1. Introduction\nThere is increasing experimental evidence to suggest that the graded expression\nof certain morphogens is vital to the generation of structure within a developing\nembryo. Somitogenesis is one example of a developmental process which utilises\nthis process as a control mechanism.\nSomites are tightly bound blocks of cells that lie along the antero-posterior\n(AP) axis of vertebrate embryos; they are transient structures and further differenti-\nation of the somites gives rise to the vertebrae, ribs and other associated features of\nthe trunk [8]. Somitogenesis is tightly regulated in both space and time [11], with\neach somite forming from a seemingly uniform field of cells via a mechanism that\ninvolves the interaction of a moving gradient of morphogen and a segmentation\nclock. Somitogenesis is one of the most well studied examples of pattern formation\nR.E.

At regular time intervals (every 90\nminutes in the chick), groups of cells at the very anterior end of each strip of the PSM\nundergo changes in their adhesive and migratory properties and coalesce to form an\nepithelial block of cells known as a somite. In this way, somites form in a very strict\nAP sequence [8,21,22] and the budding of cells from the anterior end of the PSM\ncompensates for the addition of cells at the posterior end of the PSM as the body\naxis lengthens. In this way, each band of the PSM stays approximately constant\nin length throughout the process of segmentation and a wave of cell determination\nappears to sweep along the AP axis leaving somites in its wake [18,19].\nThe Clock andWavefront model for somitogenesis was first postulated by Cooke\nand Zeeman [4]: a longitudinal positional information gradient was proposed to\nexist along the AP axis of the embryo, determining regional development by inter-\nacting with a segmentation clock to set the time in each cell at which it undergoes\na catastrophe. By catastrophe, they meant a rapid change of state, which could\npossibly be the change in the adhesive behaviour of cells when they become part\nof a somite.\nDiscovery of the periodic expression of c-hairy-1 and several other genes related\nto the Notch signalling pathway provides a molecular basis for the existence of a\nsegmentation clock [10]. Recent experimental evidence concerning the existence of\na moving gradient of FGF8 expression along the AP axis of vertebrate embryos [5]\nhas provided a basis for the wavefront and an experimentally grounded version\nof the Clock and Wavefront model has recently been proposed by Pourquie\u00b4 and\nco-workers [6,12].\n1.1. Aims and outline\nIn previous papers we have analysed the effects of heat shock on somite forma-\ntion [3,9], included cell movement during the segmentation process [18] and anal-\nysed the effects of local application or inhibition of FGF8 on somitogenesis [1].\nHere we develop and analyse a mathematical formulation of the Clock and\nWavefront model proposed by Pourquie\u00b4 and co-workers [5,6]. Our model is an\nextension of a mathematical formulation proposed by Collier et al. [3] consisting\nof two coupled partial differential equations, whose non-linear coupling gives rise\nto a regular pulse-like signal. The new mathematical model introduces two addi-\ntional partial differential equations which incorporate the wavefront responsible for\nthe formation of somites.\nIn Section 2 we detail a word model and accompanying mathematical for-\nmulation based on the previous models of Maini and co-workers [1,3,9,19]. We\nfind analytical solutions for the FGF8 profile along the AP axis and make some\nsimplifying assumptions (Section 4). We solve the simplified model numerically\nand present an extension to include the effects of local application of FGF8, with\n460 R.E. Baker et al.\nFig. 1. An illustration of the manner in which the gradient of FGF8 is maintained along the\nAP axis. As the tail bud regresses and creates the PSM, cells entering the PSM are endowed\nwith a base level of fgf8 which degrades over time (see mRNA gradient). Local production\nof FGF8 by such cells creates a more shallow protein gradient (see Protein gradient).\nboth a schematic view of the resulting anomalies and numerical simulation of the\nmathematical model (Section 5). This is followed by a brief discussion (Section 6).\n2. Formulation of the model\nThe work of Pourquie\u00b4 and co-workers, amongst others, over the past decade has\nprovided an experimental basis for the theoretical Clock and Wavefront model first\nput forward by Cooke and Zeeman [4]. Pourquie\u00b4 and co-workers\u2019 [5,6] experi-\nmentally grounded version of the model hypothesises that there is some interaction\nbetween the moving wavefront of FGF8 and the segmentation clock that acts to\ngate cells into somites. For a cell at a particular point, they assume that competence\nto segment is only achieved once FGF8 signalling has decreased below a certain\nthreshold, the position of which is known as the determination front [5].\nProgression of the FGF8 wavefront along the AP axis of the embryo occurs as\nthe body axis lengthens. New cells become part of the posterior PSM and they are\nassumed to transcribe fgf8 at a constant rate. Upon leaving the tail of the embryo\nthese cells lose their ability to transcribe fgf8 and their levels decrease as fgf8\nundergoes linear decay. FGF8 is translated by cells expressing fgf8 and the FGF8\ndiffuses along the AP axis to create a signalling gradient. Figure 1 shows the man-\nner in which the FGF8 gradient is established and maintained. As illustrated in the\nfigure, high levels of FGF8 signalling prevail in the posterior PSM and signalling\nlevels decrease with movement in the anterior direction. In this way cells experience\nlessening levels of FGF8 signalling as they move up through the PSM [6].\nInvestigation of a Clock and Wavefront model for somitogenesis 461\nFig. 2. Diagrammatic representation of the vertebrate body plan during somite formation.\nIn the top part of the diagram the FGF8 wavefront is illustrated together with the position of\nthe determination front. The middle section of the diagram shows the AP axis of the embryo\nwith the somites (dark grey blocks), determined region (light grey blocks) and the undeter-\nmined region (light grey band) clearly marked. The bottom part of the diagram shows the\nsegmentation clock with the time t at which cells reach the determination front and the time\nts later at which they become competent to signal. The hollow grey block marks the position\nof the next somite to be specified: the posterior boundary is fixed by the position of the\ndetermination front at the time at which cells at the anterior boundary become able to signal.\nThere are differences in both the structure of the PSM and the degree of seg-\nmental determination between the region of high FGF8 expression (posterior PSM)\nand the region of low FGF8 expression (anterior PSM). Cells in the posterior PSM\nare arranged in a loose mesenchymal manner and are labile with respect to their\nresponse to signalling (undetermined) whereas in the anterior parts of the PSM the\ncell arrangement has become more compact and the epithelialisation process has\nbegun (determined) [5].\nThe border which separates the two regions of FGF8 signalling is the deter-\nmination front (mentioned above) and it has been shown that cells require a level\nof FGF8 signalling below that expressed at the determination front in order to be\ncapable of segmentation [5]. Figure 2 illustrates the vertebrate body plan during\nsomite formation with the determination front clearly marked.\nTo develop a mathematical formulation of Pourquie\u00b4\u2019s Clock and Wavefront\nmodel, we constructed a system of equations in line with the word model, in which\nthe clock controls when the boundaries of the somites form and the wavefront\ndetermines where they form. This is in agreement with Pourquie\u00b4 and co-workers\u2019\nobservations [5,23]. In addition, we introduce the following assumptions:\n\u2013 Once cells have reached the determination front they become competent to seg-\nment by gaining the ability to respond to a chemical signal, thereby producing a\nsomitic factor.\n462 R.E. Baker et al.\n\u2013 A certain time ts after reaching the determination front cells gain the ability to\nproduce the aforementioned signal. ts is equal to the period of the segmentation\nclock, which is coincident with the period of the cycling genes.\n\u2013 Once a cell has reached the determination front and become part of a somite it\nbecomes refractory to FGF8 signalling.\nThe model is based on the signalling model for somitogenesis presented by\nMaini and co-workers [1,3,9,19]: at a certain time, a small fraction of cells at\nthe anterior-most end of the PSM will have undergone a whole oscillation of the\nsegmentation clock after reaching the determination front. These pioneer cells will\nproduce and emit a signal which will diffuse along the PSM. Any cell which has\na level of FGF8 below that expressed at the determination front will respond to\nthe signal by increasing its adhesion to neighbouring cells which are behaving in a\nsimilar manner, thereby forming a potential somite. At this point, a cell is specified\nas somitic and it will go on to form a somite during subsequent oscillations of the\nsegmentation clock. The process begins once again when cells now at the anterior\nend of the PSM become competent to signal. Emission of the signal is transient due\nto negative feedback on signal production by cells which are competent to react to\nthe signal. This feedback loop results in periodic pulses in the signal and hence the\nspecification of somites at regular time intervals. Figure 2 illustrates the vertebrate\nbody plan during somitogenesis; the interaction of the clock and the wavefront is\nclearly shown.\nHere we develop a mathematical formulation of Pourquie\u00b4\u2019s descriptive Clock\nand Wavefront model consisting of a coupled system of four non-linear partial\ndifferential equations in time and one spatial dimension (the AP axis). The state\nvariables which the system describes are a somitic factor which determines the fate\nof cells (only cells with a high level of somitic factor will go on to form part of a\nsomite), a diffusive signalling molecule which is produced by pioneer cells at the\nanterior-most end of the PSM, fgf8 mRNA (fgf8), and finally fgf8 protein (FGF8).\nWe propose the following model for somite formation:\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= (u + \u00b5v)\n2\n\u03b3 + \u03c1u2 \u03c7u \u2212 \u03bdu, (1)\n\u2202v\n\u2202t\n= \u03ba\n\u0007 + u\u03c7v \u2212 \u03bbv + Dv\n\u22022v\n\u2202x2\n, (2)\n\u2202m\n\u2202t\n= \t\u03c7m \u2212 \u03b2m, (3)\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= \u000bm \u2212 \u03b7p + Dp \u2202\n2p\n\u2202x2\n, (4)\nwhere\n\u03c7u(x, t) = H(p\u2217 \u2212 p), (5)\n\u03c7v(x, t) = H(t \u2212 t\u2217(x) \u2212 ts), (6)\n\u03c7m(x, t) = H(x \u2212 xn \u2212 cnt). (7)\nInvestigation of a Clock and Wavefront model for somitogenesis 463\nu is the concentration of somitic factor, v is the concentration of signalling molecule\nand m and p are the concentrations of fgf8 mRNA and protein, respectively. \u00b5, \u03b3 ,\n\u03c1, \u03bd, \u03ba , \u0007, \u03bb, \t, \u03b2, \u000b, \u03b7, ts , xn, cn, Dv , Dp and p\u2217 are positive constants and\np(x, t\u2217(x)) = p\u2217, (8)\ni.e. t\u2217(x) describes the path of the determination front in the (x, t) plane.\nSomitic factor production is activated by the signal and is self-regulating as lev-\nels become high. High levels of somitic factor also inhibit production of the signal,\nwhich is able to diffuse. For a more detailed explanation of the system of equations\ndescribing the somitic factor and the signal see [3,9,19]. fgf8 is produced only in\nthe tail region of the embryo which is assumed to be initially at xn and the axis is\nassumed to extend with speed cn. In this way the regression speed of the wavefront\nis coupled to the speed of axis elongation: this has been shown experimentally by\nPourquie\u00b4 and co-workers [7]. fgf8 translates FGF8 and FGF8 diffuses along the AP\naxis. All substances are assumed to undergo linear decay.\n2.1. Non-dimensionalisation\nWe non-dimensionalise by taking\nt = t\u02c6\n\u03bd\n, x = x\u00afx\u02c6, m = \t\n\u03bd\nm\u02c6, p = \t\u000b\n\u03b2\u03bd2\np\u02c6, (9)\n\u03b2 = \u03b2\u02c6\n\u03bd\n, \u03b7 = \u03b7\u02c6\n\u03bd\n, p\u2217 = \t\u000b\n\u03b2\u03bd2\np\u02c6\u2217, t\u2217 =\n\u02c6t\u2217\n\u03bd\n, (10)\nts = t\u02c6s\n\u03bd\n, Dp = \u03bdx\u00af2D\u02c6p, xn = x\u00afx\u02c6n, cn = \u03bdx\u00afc\u02c6n, (11)\nwhere x\u00af is the length of a somite. Dropping the hats for notational convenience,\nthe system of non-dimensionalised equations becomes\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= (u + \u00b5v)\n2\n\u03b3 + u2 \u03c7u \u2212 u, (12)\n\u2202v\n\u2202t\n= \u03ba\n(\n\u03c7v\n\u0007 + u \u2212 v\n)\n+ Dv \u2202\n2v\n\u2202x2\n, (13)\n\u2202m\n\u2202t\n= \u03c7m \u2212 \u03b2m, (14)\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= \u03b2m \u2212 \u03b7p + Dp \u2202\n2p\n\u2202x2\n, (15)\nwith \u03c7u, \u03c7v and \u03c7m as before.\n2.2. Boundary conditions\nWe take boundary conditions for u and v similar to those used in [9]. Cells which\nare a long way from reaching the determination front have both the level of so-\nmitic factor and signalling molecule close to zero, while cells which reached the\n464 R.E. Baker et al.\ndetermination front some time ago have some fixed level of the somitic factor and\nsignalling molecule.\nFor the fgf8 concentrations, we assume that cells which reached the determi-\nnation front some time ago have fgf8 and FGF8 levels close to zero and that cells\nwhich are a long way from the determination front have fixed levels of fgf8 and\nFGF8. We assume that the position of the determination front is close to the mid-\npoint of the FGF8 profile and therefore lies at approximately x = xn + cnt . Hence\nwe take our boundary conditions to be\nu, v \u2192 0 as x \u2212 {xn + cnt} \u2192 +\u221e,\nu, v are bounded as x \u2212 {xn + cnt} \u2192 \u2212\u221e,\nm, p are bounded as x \u2212 {xn + cnt} \u2192 +\u221e,\nm, p \u2192 0 as x \u2212 {xn + cnt} \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\n(16)\n2.3. Initial conditions\nWe take the initial conditions for u and v to be as in [9]:\nu(x, 0) =\n{\n1 if x \u2264 0,\n0 if x > 0, (17)\nand\nv(x, 0) = A\u2217H(\u2212x) + B\u2217 cosh(\u03bb(l \u2212 |x|)), (18)\nwhere\nA\u2217 = 1\n1 + \u0007 \u2212 \u00071 , B\n\u2217 = A\n\u2217sign(x)\n2 cosh(\u03bbl)\n, \u03bb =\n\u221a\n\u03ba\nDv\n, (19)\nand \u00071 \u0005 1.\nThe initial conditions for m and p are based on the travelling wave solutions of\nequations (14) and (15) at t = 0 (see Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 for more details)\nand are such that:\nm(x, 0) =\n{\n1\n\u03b2\nexp\n[\n\u03b2\n(\nx\u2212xn\ncn\n)]\nif x \u2264 xn,\n1\n\u03b2\nif x > xn,\n(20)\nand\np(x, 0) =\n{\nAl exp{n+(x \u2212 xn)} + A exp\n{\n\u03b2\n(x\u2212xn)\ncn\n}\nif x \u2212 xn \u2264 0,\nBr exp{n\u2212(x \u2212 xn)} + 1\u03b7 if x \u2212 xn > 0,\n(21)\nwhere A, n\u00b1, Al and Br are given by\nA = 1(\n\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 Dp\u03b22\nc2n\n) , n\u00b1 = \u2212cn \u00b1\n\u221a\nc2n + 4\u03b7Dp\n2Dp\n, (22)\nInvestigation of a Clock and Wavefront model for somitogenesis 465\nand\nAl = 1\nn+ \u2212 n\u2212\n(\nn\u2212A \u2212 n\u2212\n\u03b7\n\u2212 \u03b2A\ncn\n)\n, Br = 1\nn+ \u2212 n\u2212\n(\nn+A \u2212 n+\n\u03b7\n\u2212 \u03b2A\ncn\n)\n.\n(23)\nNote that these conditions assume that the last formed somite occupies a region up\nto x = 0 and so we must choose the position of the determination front accordingly\nto ensure that the next somite forms as a result of a signal produced by cells at\nx = 0.\n2.4. Numerical solution of the model\nWe solved the system of equations given by (12)-(15) numerically using the NAG\nlibrary routine D03PCF, which is designed for non-linear parabolic (including\nsome elliptic) partial differential equations in one spatial variable (see [2] for more\ndetails). We used zero flux boundary conditions on a closed bounded interval to\napproximate the infinite domain boundary conditions and continuous tanh functions\nto approximate the Heaviside functions.\nThe parameter values for the u, v sub-system of equations are taken to ensure\nthat the model is in a parameter regime which gives rise to coherent somites. This\nhas been investigated in detail by the authors in a previous paper [9] and so we\ndo not discuss it here. The remaining parameters for the fgf8 mRNA and protein\nequations can be chosen to match the speed of the wavefront and the observed levels\nof fgf8 in the PSM. However, at present, there is no quantitative data available and\nso we have estimated these remaining parameters.\nThe level of FGF8 at the determination front is taken so that cells at the anterior\nedge of the PSM (i.e. cells at x = 0 given the initial conditions stated previously)\nare able to signal at t = 0. That is, they reached the determination front a time\nt = ts previously.\nFigure 3 shows the numerical solution of the model for a control embryo. The\nfigure shows a sequence of coherent jumps in the somitic factor as a result of a set of\nperiodic pulses in the signalling molecule. The numerical solution is in agreement\nwith experimental observations.\n3. Analysis of the mathematical model\nAlthough the results from numerical simulation of the model are promising, there\nis little experimental data available on any of the model parameters and therefore\nfurther analytic study is required to make sure that the numerical results are rep-\nresentative of the general model behaviour. Extensive phase plane analysis of the\nsignalling basis of the model (u and v equations) has been presented by McInerney\net al. in [9]. Here we present some analytical results for the decoupled equations\ndescribing the fgf8 mRNA and protein dynamics (m and p).\n466 R.E.

There is little error over the whole\ndomain for the mRNA profile but the zero flux boundary conditions of the numer-\nical solution result in a more noticeable discrepancy between the protein profiles\nnear the boundaries of the domain.\n3.3. Approximations for the FGF8 dynamics\nIf fgf8 decay is very rapid there is little FGF8 synthesis outside of the tail region.\nIn this case we can make the simplifying assumption that fgf8 is only translated\ninto FGF8 in the tail of the embryo. This would require only a single equation\nto model the concentration of FGF8 along the AP axis and make future analysis\nsimpler. The likely effect of this assumption would be to make the FGF8 gradient\nsteeper, but this is an effect that could be overcome by adjusting the rate at which\nFGF8 diffuses. At present there is little experimental evidence on the magnitude\nof any parameter used in this model and the FGF8 dynamics are coupled into the\nsignalling model purely as a readout. Therefore we feel that this simplification is\nreasonable.\nSupposing that translation of FGF8 is limited to the tail region of the embryo;\nthen instead of the pair of equations describing fgf8 and FGF8, we can consider a sin-\ngle equation for the dynamics of FGF8. In non-dimensional form, this equation is:\n\u2202w\n\u2202t\n= \u03c7w \u2212 \u03b7w + Dw \u2202\n2w\n\u2202x2\n, (30)\nwhere w is the FGF8 concentration (with protein synthesis limited to the tail region)\nand \u03c7w = H(x \u2212 xn \u2212 cnt). The boundary conditions for w are given by\nw is bounded as x \u2212 {xn + cnt} \u2192 +\u221e,\nw \u2192 0 as x \u2212 {xn + cnt} \u2192 \u2212\u221e. (31)\nInvestigation of a Clock and Wavefront model for somitogenesis 469\nThe above equation can be solved in travelling wave coordinates, of the form\nz = x \u2212 xn \u2212 cnt , to give\nw(x, t) =\n{\nn\u2212\n\u03b7(n\u2212\u2212n+) exp{n+(x \u2212 xn \u2212 cnt)} if x \u2212 xn \u2212 cnt \u2264 0,\nn+\n\u03b7(n\u2212\u2212n+) exp{n\u2212(x \u2212 xn \u2212 cnt)} + 1\u03b7 if x \u2212 xn \u2212 cnt > 0,\n(32)\nwhere n\u00b1 are as defined in equation (22) but with Dp = Dw.\nFigure 6 compares the protein profile with and without local translation of FGF8\nfor a range of values of \u03b2, the rate of mRNA decay. When \u03b2 is small, there is a\nnoticeable slackening in the FGF8 gradient as more fgf8 remains to translate FGF8.\nAs \u03b2 is increased the FGF8 gradient tends to the limiting case in which there is no\nlocal translation.\nCurrently there is limited experimental data to suggest which parameter regime\nshould be chosen and hence which of the model systems (including and excluding\nfgf8 mRNA dynamics) is most accurate. However, since both of the models even-\ntually give rise to travelling waves in FGF8 we choose to investigate the effects of\nFGF8 perturbation in the regime in which FGF8 translation is limited to the tail.\n4. Reduced model\nAs a result of the assumptions made in the previous section, we choose to model\nsomite formation using the following non-dimensional model:\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= (u + \u00b5v)\n2\n\u03b3 + u2 \u03c7u \u2212 u, (33)\n\u221230 \u221220 \u221210 0 10 20\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nAP axis (x)\nPr\not\nei\nn \nco\nnc\nen\ntra\ntio\nn\nComparison of the effects of local FGF8 production\np \u2212 \u03b2=0.05\np \u2212 \u03b2=0.1\np \u2212 \u03b2=1.0\nw\nFig. 6.

As \u03b2 is\nincreased towards 1.0 the p gradient becomes more similar to the w gradient, as expected.\nParameters are as follows: \u03b7 = 1.0, Dp = Dw = 20, xn = 0.0, t = 0.0 and cn = 0.\n470 R.E.

Boundary conditions\nThe boundary conditions are taken to be as in the previous models:\nu, v \u2192 0 as x \u2212 {xn + cnt} \u2192 +\u221e,\nu, v are bounded as x \u2212 {xn + cnt} \u2192 \u2212\u221e,\nw are bounded as x \u2212 {xn + cnt} \u2192 +\u221e,\nw \u2192 0 as x \u2212 {xn + cnt} \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\n(39)\n4.2.

Graphical solution of the reduced model\nGiven the travelling wave solution for the FGF8 profile, equation (32), we see that\nthe path of the determination front, w(x, t) = w\u2217, is a straight line of the form\nx = cnt + \u03b1, where \u03b1 is a constant determined by the value of w\u2217. Knowing the\npath of the determination front enables us to plot the paths of the discontinuities of\nthe Heaviside functions \u03c7u and \u03c7v and further, to find the positions of the somite\nboundaries.\nFigure 7(a) shows a plot of the pattern of somites formed in a control embryo\nusing the reduced model. The discontinuities in \u03c7u and \u03c7v move along the AP at\nconstant speed resulting in the formation of a segmentation pattern which is tightly\nregulated both spatially and temporally.\nInvestigation of a Clock and Wavefront model for somitogenesis 471\n4.4. Numerical solution of the reduced model\nAs with the full model, we solved the reduced model numerically using the NAG\nlibrary routine D03PCF.

The\nfigure shows a sequence of coherent jumps in the somitic factor as a result of a\nset of periodic pulses in the signalling molecule. Both the graphical and numerical\nsolutions are in agreement with experimental observations.\n5. Local application of FGF8\nWe now consider adapting the model with the aim of mimicking experiments in\nwhich heparin beads soaked in FGF8 are implanted alongside the PSM. Results\nfrom such experiments carried out by Pourquie\u00b4 and co-workers [5] show the for-\nmation of a sequence of anomalous somites surrounding the bead: a series of up to\n6-7 smaller somites forms anterior to the bead and a large somite forms posterior\nto the bead.\nWe modify the model by assuming that there is another source of FGF8 in the\nPSM which remains at a fixed axial level throughout somite formation and releases\nFGF8 into the surrounding tissue.

We assume\nthe same initial and boundary conditions for u, v and w as in the control model.\nNote that this assumes that the bead is implanted at time t = 0: initially there is\nno effect on the endogenous gradient of FGF8 but as times increases, diffusion of\nFGF8 from the bead has an effect on the gradient which evolves as the somites are\nforming.\n5.1. Numerical solution\nWe solved the model with local application of FGF8 given by equations (42)-(44)\nusing the NAG library routine D03PCF as in the control case. Figure 9 shows the\nnumerical solution of the model: with local application of FGF8, a sequence of\nsmaller somites forms ahead of the bead implant and a large somite forms behind\nthe bead, as predicted using the approximate model and seen in vivo.\n5.2.

As expected, increasing the strength\nof the source and the size of the implant causes the determination front to devi-\nate further from its normal course. Conversely, if the level of FGF8 expressed at\nthe determination front is decreased then the effects of a bead implant are more\nnoticeable.\n5.5. Application to the model\nWe can apply the above result to find the positions of the discontinuities in the\nHeaviside functions of equations (36) and (37) and therefore predict the pattern of\nsomites formed.

Discussion\nIn this paper we presented a mathematical formulation of Pourquie\u00b4\u2019s Clock and\nWavefront model for somite formation. We solved the decoupled equations for fgf8\nand FGF8 analytically and proceeded to make some simplifying assumptions to\nallow prediction of the somite anomalies formed when the wavefront is perturbed\nlocally. We solved the simplified model numerically: the control case showed a\npattern of somites formed in a manner that was tightly regulated, both spatially and\ntemporally. The perturbed case showed a sequence of anomalous somites which\nInvestigation of a Clock and Wavefront model for somitogenesis 479\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nAP axis (x)\nTi\nm\ne \n(t)\n(a) Varying \u03c6\n\u03c6=0.0\n\u03c6=1.0\n\u03c6=4.0\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nAP axis (x)\nTi\nm\ne \n(t)\n(b) Varying \u03be\n\u03be=0.0\n\u03be=0.5\n\u03be=1.0\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nAP axis (x)\nTi\nm\ne \n(t)\n(c) Varying w*\nw*=0.4\nw*=0.5\nw*=0.6\nFig. 11.

Baker et al.\nmimicked those predicted by analysis of the model and also those seen in vivo [5].\nThere are a few points that it is important to note with regard to the model and we\ndiscuss them below.\nFirstly we note that the model was based on three assumptions (see Section 2)\nand we use the results of Pourquie\u00b4 and co-workers [5] to justify the first and the\nthird. The first is supported by the result that surgical inversions of the PSM result\nin somite anomalies only when the inverted tissue lies anterior to the determination\nfront at the time of inversion, demonstrating that upon reaching the determination\nfront cells make an irreversible commitment to a certain developmental pathway.\nExpression of certain genes in the PSM, such as Mesp2 [16,17], demonstrate this\ncommitment and are candidates for a biological basis for the somitic factor. The\nthird can be supported by noting that the effects of implantation of FGF8-soaked\nbeads in the PSM are felt only up to the level of the determination front at the time\nof the implant, demonstrating that cells become refractory to FGF8 signalling once\nthey have reached the determination front. However, at present, there is no biologi-\ncal basis for the signalling molecule of the second assumption: this is a hypothesis\nof the model based on the experimental work of Stern and co-workers [14,15,20].\nSecondly, we note that there is no quantitative data available on any of the\nparameters involved in the model. As a result of this we made some simplifying\napproximations that enabled us to get a greater analytical insight into the mecha-\nnisms of the model. The first assumption was to assume that mRNA decay is very\nrapid so that local mRNA translation of the protein can be effectively ignored. We\nnote that both regimes (with and without local translation) result in qualitatively\nsimilar travelling wave profiles of FGF8 along the AP axis and the signalling basis\nuses a read out from these profiles in the form of a switch; therefore it seems\nreasonable to consider the reduced model for FGF8.\nIn assuming that the FGF8 profile from the bead reaches a steady state profile\nvery quickly (in order to use the steady state approximation) we have implicitly\nassumed that diffusion of the protein is rapid. If that is not the case (as FGF8 protein\nis a relatively large molecule, this could be so), then the steady state approximation\nmay not be accurate if the determination front is close to the bead at the time of\nimplantation.\nThirdly, we note that it is likely that the effects of local application of FGF8 via a\nheparin-soaked bead are likely to wear off before all the PSM that would otherwise\nbe affected by this perturbation has been gated into somites [13]. Decaying effects\nof local application of FGF8 could result in a pronounced large somite as the decay\nof the source would confer the potential to become somitic to many cells at the\nsame time. A temporally varying local source of FGF8 is something that remains\nto be investigated.\nFourthly, we note that there could be some delay in FGF8 translation. Incorpo-\nration of a delay in the model can be easily achieved by alteration of the protein\nequation (15) so that the term involving fgf8 is of the form \u03b2m(t \u2212 \u03c4). Although\na large delay in translation (\u03c4 ) destroys the monotonicity of the gradient, we have\ninvestigated its effect and shown that the determination front will continue to move\nalong the AP axis with constant speed, and at no point before reaching the deter-\nmination front could a cell, however briefly, experience a level of FGF8 signalling\nInvestigation of a Clock and Wavefront model for somitogenesis 481\nbelow that expressed at the determination front. For this reason we do not consider\nincorporation of the delay any further.\nLastly, we note that the results of this paper clearly show the incorporation of\ncertain cells into differently numbered somites than their control counterparts. It\ncan be seen that such cells will go on to segment within a different time step and\nwill therefore experience a different number of clock oscillations before segment-\ning. Dubrulle et al. [p. 220] [5] demonstrate that \u201cFGF8 treatment can increase the\nnumber of clock oscillations experienced by PSM cells without altering their abso-\nlute axial position in tissue. Cells which experience an extra oscillation become\nincorporated into a differently numbered somite and exhibit Hox expression indic-\native of a more posterior fate when compared with contralateral control cells.\u201d Our\nmodel clearly accounts for this result.\nIt is very encouraging to see that our model can account for normal somite\nformation and mimic the results seen with local application of FGF8. In another\npaper [2] we use the models described here to make some experimentally testable\nhypotheses that we hope can be used to further verify the model.\nAcknowledgements.
