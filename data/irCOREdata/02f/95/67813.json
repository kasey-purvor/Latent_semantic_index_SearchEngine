INTRODUCTION\nO RGANIC scintillation detectors have often been usedfor the detection and spectroscopy of a wide assortment\nof radiations. For the vast majority of liquid organic scintil-\nlators, the composite yield curve consists of two exponential\ndecays\u2014the fast and slow components of the scintillator. Be-\ncause the fraction of light that appears in the slow component\noften depends on the nature of the exciting particle, one can\nuse this dependence to differentiate different kinds of radiation.\nCertain organic scintillators, including stilbene and a number of\ncommercial liquid scintillators, are particularly good exponents\nof this phenomenon that is exploited via pulse shape discrim-\nination (PSD). This is because of the large differences in the\nslow component induced by different radiations in these media.\nWhen organic scintillators are used as neutron detectors, PSD is\nan essential requirement because all neutron fields coexist with\nManuscript received July 17, 2009; revised November 12, 2009; accepted\nJanuary 26, 2010.

The most popular of these are the\ncharge comparison method [2] and the zero crossing method [3].\nBoth of these methods were originally implemented in analogue\nelectronics, often in dedicated instrumentation modules or nu-\nclear instrument modules (NIMs). More recently, both of these\nmethods have since been implemented in the digital domain as\ndigital electronic platforms have become available with the req-\nuisite speed and cost to make this possible. These methods have\nbecome the industrial standards to be used to compare with other\nnew proposed discrimination methods, such as the correlation\nmethod [4] and the curve-fitting method [5].\nIn recent years, artificial neural networks (ANN) and fuzzy\nsystems (FS) have emerged as mature technologies, with suc-\ncessful applications across many fields. They are particularly\neffective as pattern recognition tools, and on this basis ANN\nand FS can be used to classify neutron and -ray events from\nthe measurements performed by organic liquid scintillation de-\ntectors. In particular, G. Liu et al. [6] used a classic back-prop-\nagation (BP) neural network to process the shape of light pulses\nin an organic liquid scintillator; while D\u2019Antone [7] proposed\nan approach based on fuzzy logic for pulse-shape discrimina-\ntion in a single-layer scintillator detector.\nIn order to take advantage of capabilities offered by fast\ndigital electronics, B.D\u2019Mellow et al. [8] presented a discrim-\nination approach that is computationally simple, referred to\nas pulse gradient analysis (PGA). This technique provides\nreal-time, digital characterization of environments where neu-\ntrons and rays co-exist. The performance of the PGA method\nhas been compared against a digital implementation of the\nconventional charge comparison method which demonstrated\nthe PGA method provides an improvement in discrimination\nability. Very recently, a dedicated portable instrument has been\ndeveloped that provides real-time discrimination of mixed\nfields that is based on the PGA algorithm deployed on Xilinx\nVirtex 5\u00ae field-programmable gate array [9].\nAll of the above pulse-shape discrimination methods use\ntime-domain features of the signal, e.g., the implementation of\ncharge comparison method generally relies upon the integration\nof the pulse over two different intervals and that of PGA method\nis based on the comparison of the relative heights of samples\nin the trailing edge of the pulse.

For example, the results of simulation\nof PGA show that the efficacy of this method in the presence\nof significant PMT variation in pulse response is reduced\nsignificantly [8]. In the absence of this source of variance to the\nsignals, the FOM of PGA is theoretically infinite.\nBased on the above considerations, some researchers have\nbegun to consider PSD methods operating in the frequency do-\nmain. Compared with time domain, the methods developed in\nfrequency domain are more robust to the natural variance in the\npulse response arising from the PMT. There are two popular\nmathematical approaches to such spectral analysis: the Fourier\ntransform and the wavelet transform. The Fourier transform is\nusually considered to be the best transformation between time\nand frequency domains because it is time-shift invariant; while\nthe wavelet transform is an efficient tool with which to analyze\nnon-stationary signals on a time-frequency scale.\nS. Yousefi et al. [10] has recently proposed a new PSD method\nbased on the wavelet transform which is able to detect neutrons\nand rays in liquid scintillators. In this method, because the fea-\ntures are extracted at scales 512 and 1024 which are related to\ntwo low-frequency components, the discrimination algorithm is\nless sensitive to high-frequency components that the result of the\nPMT-borne variation in pulse response which is present in the\nfrequency spectrum of pulses. Experimental results show that\ncompared to PGA algorithm, the wavelet-based method pro-\nvides an improvement in reducing the overlap between neutron\nand -ray events reflected by an increase in the FOM. However,\nthe overhead of calculation of the wavelet-based PSD method is\nheavier than that of PGA algorithm and thus it is not as suitable\nfor real-time discrimination. Furthermore, its efficacy is likely to\ndecline at processing speeds consistent with current embedded\nsystems, as opposed to the relatively unlimited processing head\nroom of the digital capture oscilloscopes on which it has been\ndeveloped.\nIn this paper, a new PSD method is proposed based on\nthe Fourier transform, termed as frequency gradient analysis\n(FGA). This exploits the difference between the zero-frequency\ncomponent and the first frequency component of Fourier\ntransform of the acquired signal. The objective of this method\nis to combine the advantage of insensitivity to pulse varia-\ntion associated with spectral analysis with that of real-time\nimplementation of the PGA algorithm. A comparison of the\nperformance of the FGA method with the PGA method has\nbeen made on a theoretical basis and verified by time of flight\n(TOF). It is shown that FGA method not only increases the\nFOM, as a result of reducing the overlap area between neu-\ntron and -ray events, but that it can also be implemented in\nreal-time as is the case for the PGA method. The relevance of\nthese issues in the current climate associated with applications\nof this technology should not be understated: in applications\nwhere neutron\/ discrimination is a priority, such as in portal\nmonitoring for the presence of fissile material, extremely high\nlevels of discrimination are required. Significant regions of\noverlap wherein events cannot be identified with sufficient\nTABLE I\nSIX-PARAMETER VALUES FOR MARRONE\u2019S MODEL FOR THE ACCURATE\nREPRODUCTION OF THE AVERAGE NEUTRON AND \u0000-RAY PULSE SHAPES\nACQUIRED USING AN EJ-301 SCINTILLATOR\nconfidence undermine the use of liquid organic scintillators\nin these applications. Furthermore, portability is an almost\nubiquitous requirement of mixed-field instruments for use on\nplant and in inspection applications, and thus the deployment\nof discrimination methods on embedded platforms can be very\ndesirable.\nDetailed descriptions of FGA and its comparison with PGA\nare given in Sections 2 and 3; the verification process and exper-\nimental results are given in Section 4 and the discussion and the\nconclusions arising from this research are given in Sections 5\nand 6.\nII. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE FGA DISCRIMINATION SYSTEM\nA. Empirical Characterization of Organic Liquid Scintillators\nAn empirical formulism for the characterization of a liquid\nscintillation detector for a given volume can provide a generic\nmathematical description of pulses from that detector which can\nbe used to simulate the response from such a detector. The six-\nparameter function [5] that describes scintillator pulse shapes is\nhenceforth referred to as Marrone\u2019s model in this work and is\ngiven by:\n(1)\nwhere and are the amplitudes of the short (fast) and long\n(slow) components at , respectively, is the decay time\nconstant for the short component, is the decay time constant\nfor the long component, is the third decay constant and is\nthe time reference for the start of the signal. Table I provides\nthe values for each of the six parameters for -ray and neutron\npulse shapes, respectively, which are estimated from the data\nacquired using an EJ-301 scintillator [11]. A typical pulse shape\naccording to (1) and Table I for each radiation type is given in\nFig. 1.\nAs depicted in Fig. 1, the rising portion of a neutron pulse is\nalmost identical to that of a -ray pulse, but the falling portions\nof their pulses are significantly different. Therefore, in order to\ndecrease the complexity of the following analysis and to reduce\nthe processing overhead, the rising portion is discarded and the\npulse waveform is translated left by an amount so that the\npeak of the pulse is on the -axis. Thus (1) can be expressed as,\n(2)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on June 18,2010 at 17:40:02 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

The values of and are 3.875 ns and\n3.544 ns for neutron pulse, 4.000 ns and 3.714 ns for -ray pulse,\nrespectively.\nB. The Theoretical Basis of FGA\nFor signal processing purposes, the Fourier transform often\ntakes a time series or a function of continuous time, and maps\nit onto a frequency spectrum [12]. That is, it takes a function\nfrom the time domain and transforms it into the frequency do-\nmain which is essentially a decomposition of a function into\nsinusoids of different frequencies. In the case of a Fourier se-\nries or discrete Fourier transform, the sinusoids are harmonics\nof the fundamental frequency of the function being analyzed.\nWhen the function is a function of time and represents a\nphysical signal, the transform has a standard interpretation as\nthe frequency spectrum of the signal. The magnitude of the re-\nsulting complex-valued function at frequency represents\nthe amplitude of a frequency component whose initial phase is\ngiven by the phase of .\n1) Feature Extraction: The Fourier transform of (2) is,\n(3)\nwhere and are the real parts and imaginary parts\nof , respectively, and the magnitude spectrum of is\nthus,\n(4)\nGiven the parameters in the Table I, the dependence of\nwith is shown in Fig. 2 for a ray and neutron. There are dis-\ntinct differences between the magnitude spectrum of the -ray\nevent and the neutron event which can be used as prominent fea-\ntures to discriminate them. The frequency of the intersection of\nthe two curves in this case is 13.8 MHz. Below this frequency,\nthe amplitude of each frequency component of neutron pulse is\ngreater than that of -ray pulse and the magnitude spectrum of\nneutron pulse decreases more sharply than that of -ray pulse;\nabove this frequency, the magnitude spectra of both pulses have\nFig. 2. The magnitude spectra of \u0000-ray events and neutron events. The differ-\nences between them are distinct and can be used to discriminate each other.\nnearly the same amplitude. Therefore beyond the intersection\nthey can no longer be discriminated on this basis.\nThe optimal discrimination parameter in this context is thus\nthe value of the Fourier transform at zero frequency,\nwhich is the average value of . Since the falling portion of\nneutron pulse decreases more slowly than that of -ray events,\nthe average value for a neutron, , is greater than that for\n-ray events, , in the same time interval as expected in-\ntuitively.\nIn order to increase the FOM to take full advantage of the\ninformation provided by Fourier transform, the method of\ngradient analysis can be used to replace the single parameter\n. Like the PGA method, a frequency gradient analysis\n(FGA) is used here to discriminate neutron and -ray events.\nThe discrimination parameter is for this purpose defined as,\n(5)\n2) Feature Optimization: The FGA method uses this decay\ngradient between the amplitude of the zero-frequency compo-\nnent and the amplitude of the non-zero frequency component to\ndiscriminate neutron and -ray events. According to (2) and (5),\nthe optimal can be obtained.\n(6)\nThe relationship between and frequency is shown in\nFig. 3. At MHz, is a maximum. In reality, it is\nimpossible to isolate this frequency because the above discus-\nsion assumes a continuous system in which the data length is\ninfinitely long; in reality it is based on a discrete process and\nthe associated data length is limited. The magnitude spectrum\nis obtained by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [12].\nThe sample frequency of our experimental system is 8\nGiga Samples\/Second (GSa\/s) and the data length is usually\n256 points giving a frequency resolution of 32 MHz.

An Introduction of FOM\nThe FOM is a measure of the separation that can be achieved\nbetween different types of event distributions, and is calculated\nusing [13],\n(9)\nwhere is the separation between the peaks of the two events,\nis the full-width-half-maximum of the spread of\nevents classified as -ray events and is the FWHM\nof the spread in the neutron peak. If the probability distribution\nof each event type is assumed to be a Gaussian distribution, (9)\nbecomes,\n(10)\nFig. 4. The relationship between \u0000\u0000 \u0002\u0003\u0003 and time. With the increase of time,\n\u0000\u0000 \u0002\u0003\u0003 increases quickly and gets to a maximum, and then it decreases slowly.\nwhere the mean, , is given as and for the -ray and neu-\ntron Gaussians, respectively. The standard deviation, , is given\nas and for the -ray and neutron Gaussians, respectively.\nB. Pulse Gradient Analysis (PGA)\nThe time-domain feature extracted by PGA is the gradient be-\ntween peak amplitude and discrimination amplitude (the ampli-\ntude a specified time after the peak amplitude) [8]. The gradient\nis calculated using the following equation,\n(11)\nwhere is the gradient in time domain, is the peak ampli-\ntude, is the discrimination amplitude, is the time or sample\nthat occurred and is the time or sample that occurred.\nFurther simplification of follows since only varies once\nthe pulse is normalized and thus (11) becomes,\n(12)\nIn PGA method this decay gradient is used to discriminate\nneutron and -ray events.\nCombining (2) and (12), the optimal can be obtained,\n(13)\nThe relationship between and is shown in Fig. 4. In this\ncase, when ns, is maximized. In experimental\nterms, this is largely-dependent on the scintillator decay time\nconstants [14], [15]. Thus is usually selected within the range\nfrom 20 ns to 40 ns. In the experimental system used in this re-\nsearch, according to the analysis results of FGA,\nGHz ns was selected.\nC.

Experimental Setup\nThe experimental data analyzed in this work were acquired\nusing the TOF measurement system at the National Physical\nLaboratory, Teddington, U.K. (this set-up and its use in ac-\nquiring the data considered in this work is described in detail\nin [16]). The Li Be reaction was used to provide TOF\ndata for neutrons at two energies 0.745 MeV and 1.225 MeV.\nThe detector system for the digital acquisition consisted of a\n4.5 ml cylindrical cell scintillation detector filled with EJ-301\norganic liquid, optically-coupled to a Hamamatsu R5611\nphotomultiplier tube (PMT). The PMT was operated with a\nnegative supply voltage of V DC. The output signal from\nthe scintillator was connected to channel 1 of an Infinium\u00ae\ndigital oscilloscope, via approximately 30 m of high bandwidth\ncable. The beam-pickup signal was connected to a leading-edge\ndiscriminator in the control room, and the discriminator output\nwas then passed (via a delay) to another input of the digital os-\ncilloscope. Scintillator pulses were used to trigger acquisition.\nThe scintillator pulse and the corresponding beam-pickup\npulse data were captured digitally with a sampling rate of\n8 GSa\/s and 16-bit amplitude resolution. This enabled all\ndetected events, i.e., both rays and neutrons, to be sorted in\nterms of their time-of-arrival relative to the initial beam-pickup\ninput of the digital oscilloscope.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Experimental Results\n1) Verification of FGA by TOF: TOF spectral analysis is a re-\nliable means of discriminating -ray and neutron events, and for\nneutron spectrometry, so it is very helpful to use TOF method to\ndevelop and investigate different discrimination methods. Three\nspecific kinds of radiation types can be identified according to\nTOF method: rays, and neutrons of energies (1.225 MeV)\nand (0.745 MeV). In addition, there are those classified as\nscattered events. These arise as a result of scatter in the envi-\nronment and within the detector and fall outside of the TOF as-\nsignments of the three main event types.\nThe rays and neutron events and thus masked in terms of\ntheir TOF and this provides an alternative, independent basis for\nthe identification of radiation type alongside PSD. Each event\nhas been denoted by a symbol corresponding to its TOF assign-\nment and this has been folded into the scatter plot achieved on\nthe basis of the FGA method. The results of this analysis are\nshown in Fig. 6 for each event type. The threshold for discrimi-\nnation is depicted by a semi-arbitrary line on each plot to guide\nthe eye. This is determined on the basis of an established tech-\nnique [17] whereby the centroid of each cluster of data is iden-\ntified and a linear fit is applied to the midpoints between the\nclusters.\nIn Fig. 6(a) for example, the scatter events are shown, with a\ndistribution that extends throughout the event plane indicating\nthe lack of discrimination possible with TOF for these events.\nIn Fig. 6(b), the result for the rays is given, with a significant\nconcentration of events in the low-gradient area of the event\nplane.

The TOF data were obtained by fitting the three com-\nponents of the TOF spectrum [16] with a Gaussian expression\nand then limits either side of each component were applied at the\n10% level of the peak amplitude. The temporal information that\nis obtained from the TOF data enables each component in a field\nunder study to be isolated, i.e., each neutron energy component,\n-ray component and the scattered components. The PGA and\nFGA methods provide the PSD. Therefore, only the total neu-\ntron component and -ray component are included in Table III\nfor PGA and FGA. The ratios of neutron to -ray component\nhave also been calculated and are included in Table III, along\nwith uncertainties corresponding to one standard deviation from\nthe mean.\nTOF analysis can identify those events that have scattered\nprior to detection, since most of these fall outside of the\npeaks for event classification, but it cannot classify scattered\nevents specifically as neutron events or rays. Conversely,\nPSD methods such as PGA and FGA cannot identify whether\nindividual events have scattered but just that they are either\n-rays or neutron events from the differences in pulse shape.\nTherefore, in order to verify and compare the performances\nof PGA and FGA, the scattered events have been removed\nleaving only the rays, 1.225 MeV neutrons and 0.745\nTABLE IV\nTHE NUMBER OF EACH EVENT IDENTIFIED BY PGA AND FGA WITH THE\nHELP OF TOF\nMeV neutrons . Table IV shows the number of each event\nidentified by PGA and FGA with the help of TOF.\nV. DISCUSSION\nA. Experimental Data Arising From TOF Measurements\nIt is clear from the data in Fig. 6 that the identification of\nevents made on the basis of FGA is consistent with that per-\nformed independently by digital TOF. The -ray events are lo-\ncated as expected in the upper lobe of the scatter plot and the\nneutron events are located in the lower lobe. Furthermore, the\ndiscrimination of the neutron portion according to energy also\nagrees qualitatively with intuition; the 1.225 MeV neutrons oc-\ncupy the entire locus of the neutron lobe whilst the 0.745 MeV\nneutrons are limited by comparison, both by peak and sample\namplitude. The results obtained from Fig. 6 are also consistent\nwith that of previous reports [16].\nThe background event data are spread evenly across both\nplumes in the scatter plot, some of which correspond to events\nthat lie outside of the TOF windows, often as a result of scatter.\nAlthough the neutron\/ -ray ratio of TOF is greater than that of\nFGA, the imbalance is consistent with the additional contribu-\ntion of scatter events that cannot be discerned with FGA.\nThere are some events that are erroneously classified by the\nFGA method, and these are evident in Fig. 6. For example, some\n-ray events are incorrectly tagged by TOF measurement be-\ncause a neutron interacting in the detector can, in principle, stim-\nulate the production of a ray which is subsequently detected;\nhence a neutron event is tagged as such by TOF but is mani-\nfest with a -ray pulse shape. Such events therefore occupy the\nlow-gradient -ray region of the event plane in Fig. 6(c) and (d).\nConversely, some -ray events are mistakenly identified as neu-\ntrons by the TOF method is because they arrive at the detector\nlate, relative to directly-detected events, as a result of scatter. A\nfew of these fall within the window applied to isolate the neu-\ntrons, and thus they are identified as such in Fig. 6(b).\nB. Performance Comparison of FGA and PGA\nBoth the FGA method and the PGA method use gradient anal-\nysis to discriminate -ray events and neutron events, but each\ngradient belongs to different domain. The gradient used by PGA\nis defined as the difference between the peak amplitude and\nthe discrimination amplitude, which is a feature being extracted\nfrom the time domain; while the gradient used by FGA is de-\nfined as the difference between the zero-frequency component\nand the first frequency component of Fourier transform of the\nacquired signal, which is a feature extracted from the frequency\ndomain. In Section 3, it has been proven on a theoretical basis\nthat the performance of FGA is better than that of PGA since\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Restrictions apply. \n1690 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE, VOL. 57, NO. 3, JUNE 2010\nPGA is very sensitive to noise and variations of the light in-\ntensity from the detector. FGA is less sensitive to the high-fre-\nquency components responsible for the variation in pulse shape.\nThe comparison between the FOMs of the FGA method and\nPGA method is reported in Table II and according to (25), the\nratio of FOM between FGA and PGA is 1.40, which is consis-\ntent with the calculations achieved by (22) and Fig. 5.\nAccording to the data in Table IV, although the ratios of neu-\ntrons to rays for PGA and FGA are nearly the same as that of\nTOF, there are some slight differences in the numbers of each\nevent identified by them and the experimental results obtained\nfrom FGA are slightly closer to those of TOF. For example, the\ntotal number of -ray events arising from TOF, PGA and FGA\nare 697, 680 and 691, respectively. There are 17 -ray events\nmistakenly classified as neutron events by PGA, %,\nwhilst there are only 7 -ray events being mistakenly classified\nas neutron events by FGA, %.\nThe results obtained in Figs. 7 and 8 with the PGA method\nand FGA algorithm applied to the data from the measurement of\nTOF show similar levels of performance. However, the overlap\nbetween the -ray events and neutron events in Fig. 8 have been\ndramatically decreased compared to that in Fig. 7. A further in-\nteresting phenomenon is that the neutron events in Fig. 8(a) are\nmore closely congregated than that in Fig. 7(a), which is re-\nflected by the significantly reduced for FGA (0.085) com-\npared with PGA (0.259). This provides another perspective on\nthe benefits of the FGA over the PGA method.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nA wide variety of pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) methods\nhave been successfully utilized to classify neutron and -ray\nevents according to the excellent PSD properties and fast timing\nperformance of liquid organic scintillation detectors. Most of\nthese techniques exploit the time-domain features of the signal,\nwhich can render these methods sensitive to variation in the\npulse shape response of the detection system.\nCompared to time-domain discrimination methods, methods\ndeveloped in the frequency domain are more robust to variations\nin pulse-shape response of the scintillant cell and the PMT. In\nthis paper, a new PSD method based on the Fourier transform,\ncalled frequency gradient analysis (FGA) is proposed. This uses\nthe difference between the zero-frequency component and the\nfirst frequency component of Fourier transform of the acquired\nsignal. The objective of this method is to combine the advantage\nof insensitivity to pulse-shape variation of spectral analysis with\nthat of real-time implementation of PGA algorithm.\nSome measures have been taken to probe the feasibility of\nFGA for the digital discrimination of neutrons and rays in\nmixed radiation fields. Firstly, an accepted empirical model has\nbeen used to deduce the discrimination ability and performance\nof FGA, which provides a theoretic basis of this method.\nSecondly, FGA method is verified against that achieved via the\ndigital measurement of TOF. Thirdly, although discrimination\nafforded by the FGA method is observed to be consistent with\nthat achieved by digital TOF, further research is necessary with\nregard to potential industrial applications. Such investigations\nmight include, for example, to determine whether the FGA\nmethod is compatible with the capabilities of current embedded\nsystems, whether it offers a degree of immunity to pile-up\nand whether it heralds a real-time means of PSD. The PGA\nmethod has been demonstrated to have these advantages and\nhas been verified by TOF, and thus has been used in commercial\ninstruments. In this work it has been shown that FGA method\nnot only has some of the merits of PGA but also demonstrates\na prominent improvement in FOM.\nPerhaps the most pertinent attribute with regard to deploy-\nment on embedded systems is the issue of computational speed.\nPGA was designed with this as an explicit requirement, and yet\ndoes not discriminate successfully without normalization which\nrequires a moving average filter. This clearly reduces processing\nspeed. Conversely, FGA does not require explicit normalization\nbut it is more computationally laborious than PGA. Clearly, as\nconfigurable embedded systems continue to develop in capa-\nbility and speed, the relative merits of these methods will be\ndependent on the elegance with which they are implemented.\nSince FGA provides a fast and stable digital technique for\ndiscriminating neutron and -ray events arising from organic\nscintillation materials, such as EJ-301, BC501A, and NE213, it\nis likely that these would be used most often in tandem with the\nFGA method. New materials are being developed to offer im-\nproved response and better materials characteristics, such as re-\nduced flammability. The FGA method holds great potential for\ndigital processing of data from detectors using these materials.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to gratefully acknowledge the help\nand advice of Dr. David Thomas and Dr. Nigel Hawkes and the\ntechnical team at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington,\nU.K.\nREFERENCES\n[1] G.
