Mater. Res.)\nAbstract. The preparation of high quality ferroelectric PbTiO3-based ultrathin\nfilms by Chemical Solution Deposition, using a diol-based sol-gel method, have proved\nto be successful. However, there is a critical thickness below which the films break up\ninto isolated structures. According to previous studies, above a certain grain size to\nthickness ratio a microstructural instability occurs and the deposits are no longer\ncontinuous. We explore the use of the solvent chemistry to control this phenomenon, as\nan alternative to the more conventional variation of the crystallization parameters. The\nuse of diols with short C chain lengths, in the synthesis process of the precursor\nsolutions, leads to films with smaller grain sizes, whose critical thickness are lower. A\nreduction from 40 to 15 nm is achieved by reducing the number of C of the diol used\nfrom 5 to 2. It is concluded that a critical value of G\/t < 5.0 is necessary to obtain\ncontinuous ultrathin films with the processing conditions used.\n1. Introducci\u00f3n\nThe present miniaturization trends in the microelectronics industry, is\ndemanding an ever larger degree of integration. Device dimensions are now in the\nnanometre scale, and, thus, all the elements that are part of them. This size reduction\ncan be a challenge in some cases, like for Nanoelectromechancial Systems (NEMS), as\nmost of the techniques used for transduction reach their limits in the nanoscale [1]. The\nuse of ultrathin ferroelectric films, with large piezoelectric coefficients, is a good option\nto be explored. Besides, ultrathin films are required for writing thermally stable\ndomains for probe-based data ferroelectric storage devices [2], which to be of a uniform\nsize must be large relative to the grain size [3]. So the challenge is producing ultrathin\nferroelectric films with small grain size. However, further development in the\nfabrication methods of ferroelectric oxide nanostructures to be integrated in the new\nnanodevices is necessary, not only because of the potential technological interest [4],\nbut also because of the unique properties of ferroelectrics with reduced dimensions [5-\n8].\nChemical Solution Deposition (CSD) presents clear advantages over other\nmethods of preparation of high quality ferroelectric films for their integration in\nnanodevices. The high degree of compositional control achieved, the large deposition\nareas and the low costs have made them the method of preparation of a wide range of\noxide films for electronic applications [9]. However, they have been regarded\ntraditionally as unsuitable for the deposition of ultrathin films (below 100 nm\nthickness), and other deposition techniques as pulsed laser deposition or chemical\nvapour deposition are often used to prepare them. Regardless of that, ultrathin films\nhave been successfully obtained by CSD methods: both of non-ferroelectric [10,11] and\nferroelectric [12-17] compositions, with thickness as low as 9 nm, as has been reported\nrecently [18].\nHowever, there is a serious problem concerning the loss of continuity in films\nwith reduced thickness. Based on previous observations, Millar and Lange developed a\nmodel [19], which predicts that, above a critical value of the grain size to thickness ratio\n(G\/t), a microstructural instability occurs, and films break up into separated structures.\nThickness reduction leads normally to a situation in which grains reach similar\ndimensions to film thickness. Grain growth is then restricted to the plane of the film,\nwhich results in grains with lateral dimensions (G) larger than film thickness (t). At\nsome point, grain growth is no longer a mechanism for energy reduction, and a process\nof spheroidization of the grains starts, which produces a deterioration of the uniformity\nof the film. This can result, for small thickness, that, between two grains, pinholes to the\nsubstrate are formed. And, above a critical value of G\/t, grains form isolated structures\nand the film is no longer continuous. This model has been confirmed experimentally on\nstudies of several very thin oxide films, which become discontinuous when their grains\ngrow as a result of the use of higher crystallization temperatures [20-24]. Similarly, for\na series of films with decreasing thickness we can define a critical thickness below\nwhich a complete coating of the substrate is not achieved. Figure 1 shows the results of\nour previous works on the preparation of ultrathin films by chemical solution deposition\nmethods [16,17], and the critical thickness deduced from the analysis carried out on the\nfilms. The more diluted is the precursor solution, the thinnerr is the resulting film. The\ncorrelation between these two parameters is broken when a certain critical thickness is\nreached. The loss of continuity is the reason, and, therefore, the calculated values of\nthickness from the reflectivity measurements are an average between coated and\nuncoated areas. It was concluded that there seems to be a critical thickness around 17\nnm for all the series of lead titanate based films studied. In this work, we study the role\nof the solvent chemistry in the preparation of ultrathin films, and its influence on the\nappearance of the microstructural instability that leads to discontinuous films. Both the\nsolvent used for the dilution of the precursor solution and the type of diol chosen for the\nsynthesis are proved to be relevant to decrease the critical thickness below which the\ncoatings are incomplete.\n2. Experimental procedure\nThin films of lead titanate (PbTiO3) were prepared starting from air-stable\nprecursor solutions obtained by a sol-gel route that uses a diol as solvent [25]. In this\nwork three types of diols (1,3 propanediol, 1,2 etanediol and 1,5 pentanediol) are used\nalternately to see the influence of the length of the C chain on the properties of the\nfilms. The starting reagents used were equimolar concentrations of lead acetate\ntrihydrate, Pb(CH3COO)2\u00b73H2O, and titanium diisopropoxide bisacetylacetonate,\nTi(OC3H7)2(CH3COCHCOCH3)2 . The diol to Pb\/Ti mole ratio used was 5:1. To\naccount for the Pb losses occurring during the crystallization, a 10 mol% excess of PbO\nwas used. The stock solutions were diluted with 2ethyl-1hexanol (C8H18O) to obtain\nconcentrations between 0.30 and 0.0125 M, that allow the preparation of ultrathin films.\nThe diluted solutions were then deposited by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 45 s onto\nPt\/TiO2\/SiO2\/(100)Si substrates. After the deposition of a single layer, the film is dried\nat 350\u00baC for 60 s on a hot plate, and then crystallization is carried out by rapid thermal\nprocessing at 650\u00baC for 50 s, with a heating rate of ~ 30\u00baC\/s.\nAliquots of the precursor solutions with 0.3 M concentrations were dried at\n100\u00baC for 12 h in a furnace. The gel powder obtained was studied by Differential\nThermal Analysis (DTA) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) between 25\u00ba and\n1000\u00baC, at a rate of 10\u00baC\/min in a Seiko TG\/DTA 320U apparatus.\nGrazing incidence X-ray diffraction with a D500 diffractometer (Siemens AG,\nBerlin-Munich, Germany ) at an incidentc angle of 1\u00ba was used to confirm that the films\nare perovskite single phase. A scanning force microscope (SFM) (Nanotec\u00ae with\nWSxM\u00ae software; Nanotec Electr\u00f3nica) was used to study the surface topography of the\nfilms with the dynamic mode. Film thickness was determined by spectroscopic\nellipsometry with a phase-modulated ellipsometer UVISEL (Horiba Ivon SAS)\noperating between 1.5 and 4.5 eV. To study the films by Transmission Electron\nMicroscopy (TEM), cross sections were prepared using a focused ion beam workstation\n(FEI FIB2000, Hillsboro, OR) following the so-called lift-out method [26]. A protective\nlayer was deposited onto the surface to avoid damaging the film during the cutting of\nthe thin lamella. Due to the ion beam exposure this layer becomes gradually amorphous\nin its outer part, although it is still crystalline close to the ultrathin films under study.\nThis can be observed in the TEM images. The cut and freed lamellas were transferred to\nnormal TEM Cu grids with a Narishige micromanipulator (Tokyo, Japan). The samples\nwere studied with a Tecnai-20 FEG TEM (FEI) working at 200 kV.\n3. Results and discussion\nFor the preparation of ultrathin films it is necessary to deposit highly diluted\nsolutions. To study the role of the solvent used for the dilution, we search an alternative\nsolvent to those traditionally used, diol or water, both already present in the synthesis\nstep. Among organic solvents, ethylhexanol provides, in principle, excellent\ncharacteristics for the dilution of the sol-gel derived solutions. Figure 1 shows the\nevolution of the film thickness with the concentration of the precursor solution for\nPbTiO3-based films. Together with results previously reported of films for which\nprecursor solutions are diluted either in diol or water [16,17], we include a new series\nobtained from solutions diluted in ethylhexanol. We observe the same trend in all of\nthem: a correlation between the thickness and the molar concentration that is lost in the\nthinnest films. We found that the reason is that below a critical value films become\ndiscontinuous. The only difference is that precursor solutions diluted in ethylhexanol\nproduce thinner films for the same concentration, which makes ethylhexanol the best\noption to prepare the thinnest films possible, and the solvent of choice for the dilution of\nthe solutions in this work.\nTo understand the difference among solutions diluted in different solvents and\ntheir influence on the resulting films, the thermal decomposition of their gels is\nanalyzed by DTA and TGA (Figure 2). The curves corresponding to the gels obtained\nfrom solutions diluted in diol and water (Figures 2.a and b) show very similar\nbehaviours. In both cases, the highest mass losses take place for temperature below\n500\u00baC, at similar positions to the exothermic peaks around 320\u00ba and 460\u00baC. In contrast,\nthe gel from the solution diluted in ethylhexanol (Figure 2.c) presents the largest mass\nloss (37.8%) below 350\u00baC, which is close to an exothermic peak at 316\u00baC. This is an\nindication that the decomposition of organics takes place at lower temperatures for the\nsolutions diluted in ethylhexanol. The emission of a large percentage of the organics\npresent in the solution at temperatures similar to those used for the drying step (350\u00baC)\nresults in a crystallization of the resulting film with less organic species trapped in its\nvolume. As a consequence residual porosity must be reduced, promoting a larger degree\nof densification and lower values of thickness for the same precursor solution\nconcentration. It must be remarked the large influence of organic species in the\nbehaviour of solutions as highly diluted as the ones used to obtain films with thickness\nbelow 100 nm. It can be concluded from these results that the films obtained from a\nsingle deposit of solutions diluted in solvents that decompose at lower temperatures,\nlike ethylhexanol, can reach lower thickness than those derived from solutions diluted in\nmore conventional solvents, like water or diol.\nHowever, the critical thickness seems to be unaltered, regardless of the solvent\nused for dilution (Figure 1). In order to obtain even thinner continuous films, an\nalternative strategy to reduce the critical thickness must be sought. It has been shown\nthat when the grain size to thickness ratio (G\/t) is above a critical value, grains become\nisolated structures, and films are no longer continuous. Therefore, to obtain complete\ncoatings for lower critical thickness it is necessary to reduce the grain size. The most\nobvious option is the reduction of the crystallization temperature. We are already using\nlow processing temperatures for the fabrication of the PbTiO3 films, and a further\nreduction leads to the appearance of undesirable non-ferroelectric pyrochlore phases.\nWe propose in this work to make use again of the solvent chemistry, specifically of the\ninfluence of the type of diol used as a solvent during the synthesis process.\nPrevious studies carried out on thin films obtained from solutions synthesised by\nthe diol route suggest that variations of the type of diol used can have significant\ninfluence on the thickness [27] and the grain size [28]. It was found that the reduction of\nthe length of the C chain of the diol leads to a decrease of the grain size. This result\nprovides the basis for a potential method of controlling the critical thickness through\nsimple modifications of the solvent chemistry.\nTo evaluate this effect, ultrathin films were prepared from highly diluted PbTiO3\nsolutions, synthesized with different diols: 1,2 etanediol, 1,3 propanediol and 1,5\npentanodiol. Dilutions were carried out in ethylhexanol. The resulting films are\nperovskite single phase according to the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction diagrams\nshown in Figure 3. Most of the reflections come from the perovskite phase, except the\n111 from the Pt bottom electrode. Similarly to our previous reported results on ultrathin\nfilms, 001 and 002 reflections are not observed, that may be due to a preferential\ncrystallographic orientation present in the film. However, this requires further\nsystematic texture analysis as GIXRD can be misleading. The evolution of film\nthickness with the concentration of the precursor solution for each series of films is\nshown in Figure 4. Contrary to the results reported in [27], no clear correlation between\nfilm thickness and the type of diol used for the synthesis of the solution is found.\nMoreover, for the thinnest films the differences observed are insignificant. This result\nshows that, in the case of highly diluted solutions, the parameter that determines the\nthickness of the derived films is mainly the dilution of the precursor solutions, which,\nbesides, in all the films studied here is carried out in the same solvent: ethylhexanol.\nIn order to study the effect of the use of different types of diol on the grain size\nof the resulting films, and, ultimately, on their continuity, an analysis of the film\nsurfaces is carried out by Scanning Force Microscopy. The images are collected in\nFigures 5-7. In all of them, an initial decrease of the grain size as thickness is reduced is\nobserved. And, as expected, for some of the thinnest films an incomplete coating of the\nsubstrate start to be evident. As expected, the observed grain sizes of the films obtained\nfrom solutions synthesized with etanediol (Figure 5) are generally smaller than those of\nthe other two series of films. Grain size is reduced gradually from \uf0bb 80-150 nm\ndiameter of the thickest film (Figure 5.a) to \uf0bb 40-100 nm of the 15 nm thick film (Figure\n5.c). An even larger decrease of the concentration of the precursor solution (0.05M)\nproduces incomplete coatings of the substrate (Figure 5.d). When a diol with more C is\nused, propanediol, (Figure 6) the films derived start to be discontinuous for depositions\nof solutions of 0.10 M (Figure 6.c), which is more evident if we reduced further the\nconcentration to 0.05 M (Figure 6.d). The continuous films (Figure 6.a and b) have\nsimilar thickness, 24 and 19 nm, respectively, and, therefore, show also grains of similar\nsize (\uf0bb 60-150 nm diameter). The occurrence of incomplete coatings is observed for the\nfilms derived from solutions 0.15 M when pentanediol is used during the synthesis\n(Figure 7). In this case the grain size is the larger of the three series: \uf0bb 125-250 nm for\nthe film 40 nm thick (Figure 7.a). Gradually, as concentration of the precursor solution\ndecreases, the regions of substrate without any coating become larger.\nFrom these results we can conclude that an increase of the length of the C chain\nof the diol used during the synthesis process of the precursor solution produces films\nwith larger grain size for the same processing conditions, being determinant for the\ncomplete coating of the substrate.\nAlthough these studies of the film surfaces by SFM give information about the\ncontinuity of the films, in some cases they are not conclusive. It has to be considered\nthat films are deposited on polycrystalline Pt, whose grains can be mistaken for those of\nthe PbTiO3 film. In order to have a more clear picture of the evolution of the films when\nthickness is reduced, and determine the critical thickness below which the films break\nup into isolated structures, transmission electron microscopy studies of cross sections of\nthe films are carried out. The results are shown in Figures 8-10. In all the micrographs\nthe different layers of the substrate (Pt\/TiO2\/SiO2\/Si) and the protective layer, used for\nthe preparation of the TEM specimens, are marked.\nThe deposition of a solution 0.20 M obtained using etanediol produces a\ncontinuous film with a thickness of 30 nm, according to the micrographs obtained by\nTEM of their cross sections (Figurea 8.a.). Grain boundaries have not a clear contrast,\nbut it can be deduced that the lateral dimensions of the grains are around 100 nm. These\nresults confirm the ones obtained by ellipsometry and scanning force microscopy shown\nbefore. A decrease of the concentration of the precursor solution (0.10 M) produces\nfilms with a more irregular thickness, as it can be seen in Figure 8.b. Thickness in this\ncase is around 15 nm, similar to the one obtained by ellipsometry, but with variations\nbetween 6 and 23 nm in different regions of the film. The thickness variations are even\nmore important for films prepared from more diluted solutions, 0.05 M (Figure 8.c).\nAlthough the coating seems to cover most of the substrate, if we look in detail, we will\nobserve that between grains the films is almost lost, which correspond to the regions\nwithout coating observed by SFM of the surface (Figurea 6.d). It must be remarked the\nspheroidization of the grains, which was predicted for stages previous to the separation\nof the film into isolated structures. The height of the grains (inset) of ~11 nm does not\ncorrespond to the value obtained by ellipsometry (8 nm). This shows that the thickness\nvalues obtained by this techniques for these films correspond to an average between\nregions with and without film. Therefore, this latter film cannot be considered\ncontinuous. From these observations we can conclude that in the case of films derived\nof the use of etanediol, and at the processing conditions used here, the critical thickness\nis close to 14 nm, which is obtained in a film obtained from a 0.10 M solution.\nWhen propanediol is used instead during the synthesis step of the precursor\nsolution, the resulting films show homogeneous thickness for the thicker films (Figure\n9.a). When the concentration of the precursor solution is lower, 0.10 M, the resulting\nfilm (Figure 9.b) shows higher inhomogeneity of the thickness, which leads to a loss of\ncoating in some regions. More separated structures (marked with arrows) are observed\nwhen the concentration of the precursor solution decreases to 0.05 M (Figurea 9.c).\nThese results confirm the trend observed in the SFM experiments (Figurea 6.c and d).\nFrom the analysis of the images, we can conclude that the critical thickness for films\nobtained from solutions synthesized with propanediol, at the specified processing\nconditions, is around 19 nm. It must be noted that it is higher than the one found for the\nprevious films, when etanediol is used instead.\nFinally, the use of pentanediol during the synthesis of the precursor solution\nresults in a continuous film when a 0.20 M solution is deposited (Figure 10.a.). Small\nvariations in thickness are observed, which results in an irregular surface and is an\nindication that it is in a stage previous to the breaking up of the film. Grains are easily\nidentified in the micrographs, whose size is larger than in the previous sets of films,\nwith lateral dimensions between 80 and 200 nm, similar to the values observed by SFM\n(Figure 7.a). The heights of the grains (30-60 nm) are also in agreement with the\naverage thickness obtained by ellipsometry (40 nm). A small reduction of the\nconcentration of the precursor solution to 0.15 M produces discontinuous films (Figure\n10.b). The isolated grains have lateral dimensions between 70 and 125 nm. Similar\nresults are obtained for the film obtained from a 0.10 M solution (Figure 10.c). In this\nlatter case the heights of the grains are a lower (20-30 nm vs. 30-40 nm), as expected\nwhen the concentration of the precursor solution is reduced. From all the results\nobtained for these films, we can deduce that, in this case, the critical thickness is much\nhigher than in the previous sets of films: around 40 nm, which proves the large\ninfluence of the type of diol used in the synthesis of the precursor solutions on the\nfabrication of continuous films.\nWith this study, it has been shown that the use of diols with different C chain\nlength in the synthesis of the precursor solutions has an effect on the grain size of the\nresulting films, which, in turn, modifies the critical thickness below which it becomes\ndiscontinuous. If we compare films derived from solutions with the same concentration,\nfor example, 0.10 M, we can observe that grain size goes from \uf0bb50-110 nm when\netanediol is used (Figure 5.c) to \uf0bb80-150 nm when pentanediol is used instead (Figure\n7.c). The former is a continuous film (Figure 8.b), while the latter is a collection of\nisolated grains (Figure 10.c). The use of diols with a short C chain favors the continuity\nof the deposits for the same concentration of the precursor solution. Similarly, the\nprocess of spheroidization of the grains in the films takes place for lower concentrations\nof the precursor solution if a diol with a shorter C chain is used. The critical thickness,\nthat marks the transition from this stage to a discontinuous film goes from 40 nm in the\ncase that the diol used is pentanediol, to 15 nm when etanediol is the choice. In fact, the\nparameter that controls this variation is the grain size to thickness ratio (G\/t).\nEstimations of G\/t values for all the films studied here and in previous works are\nsummarized in Table 1. In all cases thickness obtained by ellipsometry are used, even\nfor discontinuous films. Grain size is estimated from the lateral dimensions of a group\nof grains obtained from the scanning force microscopy images of the film surfaces. It\ncan be seen that, in general, above G\/te \uf0b3 5.0 films become discontinuous. Calculations\nbased on energy considerations [19] show that films with G\/t < 8\/\uf070 are always\ncontinuous. In our case G\/t are always above this value, and, therefore, it seems that the\ndegree of spheroidization of the grains rules the process of breaking up of the film. A\nparameter that is used to describe this [19] is \uf079, defined as the angle between the\nboundaries of two neighboring grains. \uf079 is equal to \uf070 when there is no spheroidization\nof the grains, and becomes progressively smaller until it reaches a critical value (\uf079crit),\nbelow which the neighboring grains separate. \uf079crit is directly related to G\/t [19]. The\nvalue of the angle \uf079, is determined by the free energy of the surfaces of film, substrate\nand grain boundaries, and also the interface substrate-film. Therefore, changes of these\nsurface and interface energies (processing at different atmospheres, deposits on different\nsubstrates...) can alter the microstructrual stability and the process of separation of the\nfilm. In this work, processing parameters have been similar in all cases, except for the\nchoice of solvents, so the variations of the critical values are directly related to the\ninduced variations of the grain size. From our results it seems that for PbTiO3 films,\nobtained by Chemical Solution Deposition on platinized Si-based substrates, a critical\nvalue of G\/t < 5.0 is necessary to obtain continuous ultrathin films.\n4. Conclusions\nThis work demonstrates the important role of the solvent chemistry in the\npreparation of continuous ultrathin films by Chemical Solution Deposition methods.\nThe use of solvents that decompose at lower temperatures, like ethylhexanol, for the\ndilution of the precursor solutions produces films with lower thickness than the ones\nobtained with more traditional solvents. This is specially important for ultrathin films,\nas we use highly diluted solutions to prepare them. We have explored as well the role of\nthe diols used as solvents during the synthesis of the precursor solution, and the results\nshow that they allow a control of the grain size of the films, which is a good alternative\nto the more conventional variations of the crystallization parameters normally used to\nthis end. Decreasing the grain size through the choice of a diol with a short C chain\n(etanediol) leads to the preparation of continuous films with lower thickness, i.e., the\ncritical thickness below which the films break up into isolated structures can be reduced\nto a value close to 15 nm, which corresponds to a value of the grain size to thickness\nratio, G\/t < 5.0\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is part of the activities of the European network of excellence \u201cMultifunctional and\nIntegrated Piezoelectric Devices MIND\u201d (NoE 515757) and it has been partially funded by the\nSpanish project MAT2007-61409.
