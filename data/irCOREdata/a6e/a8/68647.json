These\nconsiderations apply a fortiori to the study of fluctuation phenomena in nonlinear\nsystems, and thus account for the increasing role being played by analogue and digital\nsimulations, which enable the behaviour of the model systems to be investigated in\nconsiderable detail.\nSeveral years have now passed since a contribution [1] to an earlier volume in this\nseries illustrated some of these ideas. It was shown in particular that detailed analyses\nof fluctuations in model systems not only provide a deeper understanding of complex\nphenomena but often also pave the way to the development of new experimental\ntechniques and new ideas of technological significance.\nIn this chapter, we discuss the application of simulation techniques to the study of\nfluctuational escape and related phenomena in nonlinear optical systems: that is, sit-\nuations where a large deviation of the system from an equilibrium state occurs under\nthe influence of relatively weak noise present in the system. We will be interested\nprimarily in the analysis of situations where large deviations lead to new nontrivial\nbehaviour or to a transition to a different state. The topics to be discussed have\ni\nPublished in Modern Nonlinear Optics. Part 3, 2nd Edn, Adv. \nChem. Phys. 119, 469-524 (2001).\nii FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\nbeen selected mainly for their own intrinsic scientific interest, but also in order to\nprovide an indication of the power and utility of the simulation approach as a means\nof focusing on, and reaching an understanding of, the essential physics underlying the\nphenomena under investigation; they also provide examples of different theoretical\napproaches and situations where numerical and analogue simulations have led to the\ndevelopment of new experimental techniques and new ideas with potential techno-\nlogical significance. Although the different Sections all share the same general theme\n- of fluctuational escape phenomena in model nonlinear optical systems - they deal\nwith quite different aspects of the subject; each of them is therefore to a considerable\nextent self-contained (with Secs. 1.4 and 1.5 being exceptions, because they should\nbe read after Sec. 1.3) and thus can be read almost independently of the others.\nBefore considering particular systems, we review briefly the scientific context of the\nwork and discuss in a general way the significance of escape phenomena in nonlinear\noptics.\nThe investigation of fluctuations by means of analog or digital simulation is\nusually found most useful for those systems where the fluctuations of the quantities of\nimmediate physical interest can be assumed to be due to noise. The latter perception\nof fluctuations goes back to Einstein, Smoluchowski, and Langevin [2, 3, 4] and\nhas often been used in optics (cf. Refs. [5, 6, 7, 8]). In nonlinear optics, the\nnoise can be regarded as arising from two main sources. First there are internal\nfluctuations in the macroscopic system itself. These arise because spontaneous\nemission of light by individual atoms occurs at random, and because of fluctuations\nin the populations of atomic energy levels. The physical characteristics of such noise\nare usually closely related to the physical characteristics of the model that describes\nthe \u201cregular\u201d dynamics of the system, i.e. in the absence of noise. In particular, the\npower spectrum of thermal noise and its intensity can be expressed in terms of the\ndissipation characteristics via the fluctuation-dissipation relations (cf. Ref. [9]) and,\nif the dissipation is non-retarded so that the corresponding dissipative forces (e.g.\nthe friction force) depend only on the instantaneous values of dynamical variables,\nthe noise power spectrum is independent of frequency, i.e. the noise is white. The\nmodel of noise as being white and Gaussian is one of the most commonly used in\noptics because the quantities of physical interest often vary slowly compared with\nthe fast random processes that give rise to the noise, like emission or absorption of\na photon [5, 6, 7, 8]. The second very important source of noise is external: for\nexample, fluctuations of the pump power in a laser. The physical characteristics of\nsuch noise naturally vary from one particular system to another; its correlation time\nis often much longer than that of the internal noise, and its effects can be large and\nsometimes quite unexpected (cf. Ref. [10]).\nIn general, the fluctuations observed in nonlinear optics are both spatial and\ntemporal, i.e. the variations of the quantities of interest occur to a large extent\nindependently in time and in space. However, in many cases the spatial modes in a\nsystem are well-separated: the dynamics of interest is then just that of a few dominant\nmodes. The appearance of such modes is typical for high-Q active and passive optical\ncavities. In view of recent progress in microelectronics (quantum-dot technology,\nsemiconductor-laser arrays, etc.), the investigation of systems with a discrete set\nINTRODUCTION iii\nof spatial structures (modes) is particularly interesting and important [11]. The\namplitudes and phases of the actual modes (or other appropriate characteristics of a\nsystem that do not depend on coordinates) make a set of purely dynamical variables,\nand the analysis of fluctuations in a system reduces to the investigation of the kinetics\nof a dynamical system.\nOne of the most remarkable phenomena where fluctuational transitions play a key\nrole is stochastic resonance (SR), a phenomenon in which a weak periodic signal\nin a nonlinear system is enhanced by an increase of the ambient noise intensity; a\nstronger definition requires that the signal\/noise ratio (SNR) should also increase.\nThe SR phenomenon appears to be widespread. After being introduced as a possible\nexplanation of the earth\u2019s ice-age cycle [12, 13], SR has subsequently been observed\nor invoked in a large variety of contexts: see e.g. [14, 15, 16, 17, 18] for reviews. SR\nhas also been extensively investigated in nonlinear optical systems including lasers\n[19, 20, 21, 22], passive optical systems [23, 24, 25, 26], and a Brownian particle in an\noptical trap [27]. In this chapter, following a brief introduction to the SR phenomenon\nin an optical bistable system, a new form of optical heterodyning related to stochastic\nresonance is described, in which two high-frequency signals (input and reference\nsignals) are applied to a bistable system. We note that the effect of noise-enhanced\nheterodyning was first predicted theoretically and investigated in analogue model in\na broad range of parameters [28].These investigations in turn made it possible to\nobserve a noise-induced enhancement of heterodyning in an optical bistable device\n[29]. At the same time, noise-induced increase of the SNR (rather than of the signal\nonly) can occur only in certain classes of nonlinear systems [31].\nWhen it was first discovered, and for some time afterwards, SR seemed a rather\nmysterious phenomenon and a number of highly sophisticated theoretical approaches\nwere proposed (see citations in e.g. the reviews [16, 30, 32, 33]. All these theories\nassumed that bistability is an essential prerequisite for the SR phenomenon to occur.\nOnly some years later was it appreciated [34, 35] that a much simpler formalism \u2013\nlinear response theory (LRT) \u2013 would suffice to describe what was often the most\ninteresting limit in practice, where the signal was relatively small and the noise was\nrelatively strong. An analytic theory of the more complicated effects that occur for\nstronger signal strengths [34, 36, 37, 38] has also been developed, and has been\nconfirmed in considerable detail through analogue electronic experiments.\nThe perception of SR as a linear response phenomenon led naturally, however, to\nthe realisation that SR can also occur without bistability [31, 39, 40] and to observa-\ntion of the phenomenon in an underdamped, monostable, nonlinear oscillator [39].\nIn fact, it is well-known that the response of a monostable system to signals in certain\nfrequency ranges can be strongly increased by noise, e.g. just by raising the tem-\nperature. Examples range from currents in electron tubes to optical absorption near\nabsorption edges in semiconductors. For underdamped oscillators, a temperature-\ninduced shift and broadening of the absorption peaks, i.e. \u201ctuning\u201d by external driving\ndue to the oscillator nonlinearity, was first discussed in [41]; complete classical and\nquantum theories of these effects were given in [42]. Underdamped systems were\nalso considered in [43].\niv FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\nDescribing SR in terms of a susceptibility is particularly advantageous for systems\nthat are in thermal equilibrium, or in quasi-equilibrium. In such cases the fluctuation-\ndissipation relations [9] can be used to express the susceptibility in terms of the\nspectral density of fluctuations in the absence of the periodic driving. This was used\nexplicitly in the case of noise-protected heterodyning. It is true in general that the\nanalysis of fluctuations is greatly facilitated by the presence of thermal equilibrium\nwhen the conditions of detailed balance and of the time reversal symmetry are\nsatisfied [44].\nHowever, in many cases the fluctuating systems of interest are far from thermal\nequilibrium. Examples include optical bistable devices [45], lasers [46, 23], pattern\nforming systems [47], trapped electrons which display bistability and switching\nin a strong periodic field [48, 49, 50], and spatially periodic systems (ratchets)\nwhich display a unidirectional current when driven away from thermal equilibrium\n[51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56]\nA powerful tool for analysing fluctuations in a non-equilibrium systems is based\non the Hamiltonian [57] theory of fluctuations or alternatively on a path-integral\napproach to the problem [44, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62]. The analysis requires the solution\nof two closely interrelated problems. The first is the evaluation of the probability\ndensity for a system to occupy a state far from the stable state in the phase space. In\nthe stationary regime, the tails of this probability are determined by the probabilities\nof large fluctuations.\nThe other problem is that of the fluctuational paths along which the system\nmoves when a large fluctuation occurs. The distribution of fluctuational paths is a\nfundamental characteristic of the fluctuation dynamics, and its understanding paves\nthe way to developing techniques for controlling fluctuations. Its importance for\ngaining insight into the physics of fluctuations from a dynamical perspective was\nrecognized almost half a century ago by Onsager and Machlup [44]. A theoretical\nunderstanding, and basic techniques for treating the problem, have been developed\nsince that time; but it was not until recently [60] that the distribution of fluctuational\npaths for large fluctuations was observed in an actual experiment, through an analogue\nsimulation.\nA simple qualitative idea behind the theory of large fluctuations in noise-driven\nsystems is that such fluctuations result from large outbursts of noise that push the\nsystem far from the attractor. The probabilities of large outbursts are small, and\nwill actually be determined by the probability of the most probable outburst of noise\ncapable of bringing the system to a given state. This particular realisation of noise is\njust the optimal fluctuational force. Because a realisation (a path) of noise results in a\ncorresponding realisation of the dynamical variable [63], there also exists an optimal\npath along which the system arrives to a give state with overwhelming probability.\nFrom a different perspective, optimal paths were first described for nonlinear non-\nequilibrium Markov systems in [57]. Using another approach, the analysis of the tails\nof the distribution was also done in [64], whereas the approach described above was\ndiscussed in [65] in the context of escape from a metastable state. This approach is not\nlimited to Markov systems [42]. For systems driven by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise,\nthe problem of optimal paths was discussed in [58, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73]; an\nINTRODUCTION v\nequivalent eikonal formulation was developed in [74, 75, 76, 77]. The general case\nof Gaussian noise was discussed in [78, 79, 80]; see also Sec. 1.3. For reviews of\nrelated work on fluctuations in colored noise driven systems see [81, 82].\nA brief introduction to the theory of large fluctuations is given in Sec. 1.3 together\nwith the results of some direct observations of the optimal paths in model systems.\nIt is very important to note that, following the first observations of optimal paths in\nanalogue electronic models, fluctuational paths have very recently been investigated\nin optical systems, including measurements of the so-called prehistory probability\ndistribution (PPD) of the radiation intensity I for dropout event in a semiconduc-\ntor laser [83], and the time-resolved measurement of polarization fluctuations in a\nsemiconductor vertical-cavity surface emitting laser [84].\nThe preliminary analogue and numerical simulations made it possible to test\nfundamental tenets of the theory of large fluctuations, and thus to provide an experi-\nmental basis on which the theory could advance. At the end of Sec. 1.3 and in Sec.\n1.4 we present two examples of recent advances in the theory of large fluctuations.\nIn the first example, the time evolution of the escape flux over a barrier on a short\ntime scale is considered. It is a problem of of fundamental importance [85] and,\nfurthermore, of immediate practical interest given that new methods of spectroscopy\nwith femto-second resolution have recently become available [86]. The technique of\nnon-stationary optimal paths can be employed to solve the problem and numerical\nsimulations verify the theoretical predictions. The striking feature predicted theo-\nretically and demonstrated in simulations is that, for a system initially at the bottom\nof the well, the escape flux over the barrier on times of the order of a period of\nan eigen-oscillation grows in a step-wise manner, provided that friction is small or\nmoderate. If the initial state is not at the bottom of the well, the steps at large enough\ntimes transform into oscillations. The step-wise\/oscillatory evolution at short times\nappears to be a generic feature of a noise-induced flux.\nThe second example is related to the recent analytical solution [56, 87] of the long-\nstanding problem of escape from a potential well in the presence of non-adiabatic\nperiodic driving. It was shown [56, 87] that, over a broad range of driving field\nmagnitudes, the logarithm of the fluctuation probability is linear in the field, and\nthe response can therefore be characterized by a logarithmic susceptibility (LS). We\nevaluate the activation energies for escape, with account taken of the field-induced\nlifting of the time and spatial degeneracy of instantonlike nucleation trajectories. The\nimmediate advantage of the theory is that it provides the solution of a complicated\ntheoretical problem in a simple analytic form that describes the dependence of the\n\u201cactivation energy\u201d on both the amplitude and frequency of the driving field and can\nbe extended immediately to a periodic driving field of arbitrary form.\nAnalogue experiments and digital simulations confirmed that the variation of the\nactivation energy for escape with driving force parameters is accurately described\nby the logarithmic susceptibility (LS). Experimental data on the dispersion are in\nquantitative agreement with the theory. And, again, it is interesting to note that,\nafter the LS was investigated in analogue and numerical simulations, it was then\nalso measured in optical experiments on a sub-micron brownian particle in a bistable\nthree-dimensional optical trap [88, 89]. This research emphasizes the fundamental\nvi FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\nimportance of the logarithmic susceptibility, a new physical quantity that relates the\nresponse of the system in the absence of detailed balance to its characteristics in\nthermal equilibrium. It yields quantitative agreement with experiment and expresses\nthe corrections to the \u201cactivation energy\u201d in a simple integral form analogous to that\nwell-known from linear response theory.\nIn the preceding example, analogue and numerical simulations were used to verify\nexisting theoretical predictions. However, in reality the significance of analogue\nand digital simulations goes far beyond this modest role. The analogue circuit\ncombines features of a real physical system and of the computer model and an attentive\nresearcher can very often make important discoveries by analysing its behaviour.\nPerhaps the most striking example is given in the review by Kautz [90]: \u201cIn discussing\nanalogue simulations of a rf-biased Josephson junction, performed by Levinsen and\nothers at Berkley, Levinsen and Sullivan conceived a new type of voltage standard...\u201d.\nFrom our own experience, examples of theory being led by the analogue simulation\ninclude the discovery of the noise-induced spectral narrowing [91] and of SR in\nmonostable systems [31, 39], leading to extensive research by many groups and\ncorrespondingly to substantial theoretical progress.\nWe then report and discuss the results of recent investigations of fluctuational\nescape from the basins of attraction of chaotic attractors (CA). The question of noise-\ninduced escape from a basin of attraction of a CA has remained a major scientific\nchallenge ever since the first attempts to generalize the classical escape problem to\ncover this case [92, 93, 94]. The difficulty in solving these problems stems from the\ncomplexity of the system\u2019s dynamics near a CA and is related, in particular, to the\ndelicate problems of the uniqueness of the solution and the boundary conditions at a\nCA. The approach proposed here is based on the analysis of the prehistory probability\ndistribution. It is shown in particular that both the existence and uniqueness of\nsolution can be verified experimentally using measurements of a PPD. Moreover,\nusing this technique and its extension [95] to measure both the optimal paths and the\ncorresponding optimal fluctuational force, one can identify the initial conditions on\na chaotic attractor and find an approximation to the energy-optimal control function\nof escape from a CA, thus paving the way to exciting new applications in the field\nof nonlinear control. One such application to the energy-optimal control of escape\nfrom the basin of attraction of CA of a periodically driven nonlinear oscillator will\nbe described. Finally, a fluctuational escape from a Lorenz attractor, a well-known\nsystem that is of importance in modelling the dynamics of real optical systems, will\nbe discussed.\nThe chapter is organized as follows: Sec. 1.2 describes an investigation of the\nSR phenomenon and of noise-protected heterodyning in an electronic circuit and in\nan optical bistable device. Sec. 1.3 discusses the results of investigation of optimal\npaths for large fluctuations and their relationships to the analysis of fluctuations in\nreal optical systems. Sec. 1.4 presents two examples of recent advances in the theory\nof large fluctuations related to the time evolution of the escape flux over a barrier in\na potential system on a short time scale, and to the non-adiabatic escape problem.\nThe results of numerical and analogue simulations are compared with theory. Sec.\n1.5 describes investigations of the escape from a CA and the applications of these\nSTOCHASTIC RESONANCE AND NOISE-PROTECTED HETERODYNING vii\nresults to the solution of the nonlinear optimal control problem. Finally, in Sec. 1.6,\nwe summarise the results and consider future perspectives.\n1.2 STOCHASTIC RESONANCE AND NOISE-PROTECTED\nHETERODYNING\n1.2.1 Introduction\nThe idea of stochastic resonance (SR) was introduced by Benzi et al. [12], and\nNicolis [13], who showed that a weak periodic signal in a nonlinear system can be\nenhanced by the addition of external noise of appropriate intensity; it was demon-\nstrated subsequently that the same is often true of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nas well [19, 96]. Recently the quest for practical applications of SR has become\na subject of intensive investigation [97]. An important restriction in this respect is\n[97, 28] that the frequency of the input signal should be low compared to the char-\nacteristic frequencies of the system under study. Indeed most investigations of SR to\ndate [20, 23, 34, 35, 98, 99, 100, 101] (see also [102] and references therein) have\nrelated to low-frequency signals driven bistable systems. The origin of the SR in such\ncases lies in the fact that the low-frequency driving force modulates the probabilities\nof fluctuational transitions Wnm between the coexisting stable states, and hence the\npopulations of the states, which gives rise to a comparatively strong modulation of a\ncoordinate of the system with an amplitude proportional to the distance between the\nstable positions. This mechanism of strong response of a symmetric bistable system\nto an external forcing was first suggested by Debye [103] in the context of molecules\nthat have several different equivalent orientations in solids and may reorient between\nthem. Since the transition probabilities increase sharply (exponentially, for Gaussian\nnoise) with noise intensity D, the efficiency of modulation and the SNR are also\nsharply increased. The mechanism is operative provided: (i) the stationary popula-\ntions of the states are nearly equal to each other; and (ii) the frequency of the force is\nmuch smaller than the reciprocal relaxation time t\u22121r of the system (see [15]). It was\nsuggested [28], however, and demonstrated in analogue simulations, that a related\nphenomenon can occur when a nonlinear system is driven by two high frequency\nsignals: if the resultant heterodyne signal is of sufficiently low frequency, both it and\nits SNR can be enhanced by the addition of noise.\nHere, we use the ideas of SR and heterodyning to demonstrate the new phe-\nnomenon of noise-enhanced optical heterodyning in an optically bistable (OB) device\ndriven by two modulated laser beams at different wavelengths. An optical system was\nchosen for the investigations for two main reasons. First, because of recent progress\nin optical data processing and communication [104, 105] and of possible applications\nof optical bistability in this context [106]: the trend to miniaturise OB devices and\nto reduce their threshold power [107] has highlighted the problem of controlling the\nsignal and the SNR in optical systems. Secondly, OB systems provide an opportu-\nnity to investigate a wide range of quite general fluctuation phenomena associated\nviii FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\nwith coexisting stable states far from thermal equilibrium. Thus the investigation of\nfluctuations in these systems is of fundamental interest and significance.\nIn Sec. 1.2.2 the fluctuations and fluctuational transitions in an OB system subject\nto white noise are analysed. In Sec. 1.2.3 the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in\nthe OB system is discussed in terms of linear response theory and the corresponding\nexperimental results are presented. In Sec. 1.2.4 we discuss theory and experimental\nresults for the new form of optical heterodyning noise-protected with stochastic\nresonance. Finally, Sec. 1.2.5 contains concluding remarks.\n1.2.2 Fluctuations and fluctuational transitions in an OB system.\n1.2.2.1 Theory. A simple model that makes it possible to describe optical bista-\nbility in a variety of systems is a plane nonlinear Fabry-Perot interferometer, filled\nwith a medium whose refractive index is intensity dependent [106]. The \u201cslow\"\nkinetics of a nonlinear interferometer may be often described by a Debye relaxation\nequation for the phase gain \u03c6, of form\n\u03c6\u02d9+\n1\n\u03c4\n(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60) = Iin(t)M(\u03c6) + Iref(t), (1.1)\nIT (t) = N(\u03c6)Iin(t), N(\u03c6) = N(\u03c6+ 2pi), M(\u03c6) =M(\u03c6+ 2pi).\nHere Iin(t) is the intensity of the incident radiation, and \u03c60 is the phase of the\ninterferometer in the dark. The functions N(\u03c6) and M(\u03c6) relate the intensities of\nthe transmitted and intracavity fields to that of the incident light. The function Iref(t)\ncorresponds to the intensity of radiation from an additional source, which is very\nlikely to be present in a real device to control the operating point. This description is\nvalid in a plane wave approximation, provided that we neglect transverse effects and\nthe intracavity build-up time in comparison with the characteristic relaxation time of\nnonlinear response in the system. It has been shown that the Debye approximation\nholds for many OB systems with different mechanisms of nonlinearity.\nLet us now consider stochastic motion in an OB system. In general, noise in\nan OB system may result from fluctuations of the incident field, or from thermal\nand quantum fluctuations in the system itself. We shall consider the former. The\nfluctuations of the intensities of the input or reference signals give rise respectively\nto either multiplicative or additive noise driving the phase. Both types of fluctuations\ncan be considered within the same approach [108]. Here we discuss only the effects\nof zero-mean white Gaussian noise in the reference signal:\nIref(t) = I\u00afref +\u2206I(t), \u3008\u2206I(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008\u2206I(t)\u2206I(0)\u3009 = 2D\u03b4(t).\nIn this case, for a constant intensity of the input signal, Iin(t) = I\u00afin = const, Eq.\n(1.1) describes the Brownian motion of the phase \u03c6 in a bistable potential\nU(\u03c6) =\n1\n\u03c4\n(\n1\n2\n\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c6\u03c60)\u2212 I\u00afref\u03c6\u2212 I\u00afin\n\u222b \u03c6\n0\nd\u03c6\u2032M(\u03c6\u2032). (1.2)\nSTOCHASTIC RESONANCE AND NOISE-PROTECTED HETERODYNING ix\nStable states can be found, for example, by graphical solution of the equation\n1\/\u03c4(\u03c6\u2212\u03c60) =M(\u03c6)I\u00afin+ I\u00afref for the potential minima [42, 65], and it can be shown\nimmediately that OB arises only if system is biased by a sufficiently strong external\nfield, i.e. when it is far away from thermal equilibrium. If the noise intensity is weak,\nthe system when placed initially in an arbitrary state will, with an overwhelming\nprobability, approach the nearest potential minimum and will fluctuate near this\nminimum. Both the fluctuations and relaxation will be characterised by the relaxation\ntime of the system \u03c4r. So within a time \u223c \u03c4r the system forgets about its initial state\nand a quasistationary distribution is formed near the stable position. It is of Gaussian\nshape near its maximum and of width \u221d (D\u03c4r)1\/2. If the noise intensity is small\ncompared to the potential barrier height, fluctuational transitions between the stable\nstates occur rarely and the probabilities Wnm of transitions are given by Kramers\u2019\n[109] relation\nWnm \u221d exp(\u2212\u2206Un\/D). (1.3)\nThe stationary distribution over the wells is formed over a time\u223c max {W\u22121nm} . For\nthe case of white Gaussian noise this distribution has the well known form of the\nGibbs distribution:\np(\u03c6) = Z\u22121 exp(\u2212U(\u03c6)\/D), Z =\n\u222b\nd\u03c6 exp[\u2212U(\u03c6)\/D]. (1.4)\nFor small noise intensities the distribution has sharp maxima near the stable states\nand their populationsw1,2 are described by the balance equations\nw\u02d91 = \u2212W12w1 +W21w2, w2 = 1\u2212 w1. (1.5)\nFor arbitrary parameters of the system, w1 and w2 differ dramatically from each\nother, one of them being \u223c 1, with the other close to zero. Within a narrow range\nof parameters, however, they have the same order of magnitude and one can refer\nto the kinetic phase transition between the two stable states: it is analogous to the\nfirst-order phase transition in an equilibrium system with a potential (in the absence\nof quantum fluctuations) playing the role of the generalised free energy of the system\n[42, 65, 110]. This is the range of parameters that is of particular interest in the\npresent paper.\nThe model (1.1)-(1.5) describes stochastic motion in a general OB system for\nwhite Gaussian noise in the low noise intensity limit. We now apply this model to the\ndescription of some experimental results on fluctuations and fluctuational transitions\nin some particular OB devices.\n1.2.2.2 Experiment In the experiments we have used two approaches. First, we\nhave simulated the kinetics of a bistable optical system in the Debye relaxation appox-\nimation for different forms of potential by means of electronic analogue simulation.\nSecondly, we have investigated the kinetics of a double-cavity membrane system\n(DCMS) driven by two modulated laser beams at different wavelengths. This system\nis known to display optical bistability [111].\nx FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\nX\nX\nX\nC1\nR9 R6\nR7\nR8\nR5R4\nR1\nR2\nR3\nrefF   (t)\nF   (t)in\nf(t)\nx(t)\n+\n-\n+\n-\n+\n-\nFig. 1.1 Analog circuit used in the heterodyning simulations of [28]\nAn example of an electronic circuit is shown in Fig. 1.1. It is similar to the circuit\nused to model an OB system with a dispersive mechanism of nonlinearity [112]. The\ncircuits were driven by noise from a feedback-shift-register noise generator and in\naddition, if necessary, by sinusoidal periodic forces from a pair of Hewlett-Packard\nModel 3325B frequency synthesizers. In the DCMS used for the optical experiments\nPrism\nAmplifier\nSignal\n\u2126 + \nAmplifier\nEOM2\n+ \nSignal\nComputer\nPhotodiode\nDCSM\nNoise\nGenerator\nGenerator\nGenerator 0 \u03c9 \nEOM1\nAr laser\nFig. 1.2 Diagram showing the laser setup used in [29]\n(see Fig. 1.2), the first resonator is formed by a membrane consisting of a thin\nfilm (\u2248 1\u00b5m thick) of semiconducting GaSe single crystal, separated from a plane\ndielectric mirror by a metal diaphragm \u2248 500\u00b5m in diameter. The air-filled gap\nbetween the mirror and the membrane is\u2248 10\u00b5m wide and forms a second resonator.\nThe incident beam from an argon laser, of wavelength 514.5 nm, propagating along\nthe normal to the mirror, provides an input signal. An additional beam of wavelength\n488 nm from an argon laser is inclined with respect to the DCMS axis and provides\na reference signal. The intensities of the laser beams are modulated by two electro-\noptic shutters, to which periodic signals and noise are applied. The optical bistability\narises because of thermoelastic bending of the membrane caused by the 514.5 nm\nlaser beam: this particular mechanism has been found to be very effective for the\ninvestigation of a variety of OB effects [111, 113, ?]. The form of the periodic\nfunction M(\u03c6) in (1.1) depends on the mechanism of thermal relaxation and the\nSTOCHASTIC RESONANCE AND NOISE-PROTECTED HETERODYNING xi\nboundary conditions at the edge of the film; an approximate expression was found\nin [111] on the basis of variational analytic approaches developed for describing\nthe thermoelasticity of shells. The phase gain \u03c6 is linear in bending and follows\nadiabatically the thermal relaxation of the film, thus ensuring the validity of the\nDebye relaxation approximation. Heating of the DCMS by the 488 nm reference\nsignal is directly proportional to its intensity.\nIt follows from the above discussion that an indicator of applicability of the de-\nscription of stochastic motion in an OB system is an activation dependence of the\ntransition probabilities Wnm on the noise intensity. Using level-crossing measure-\nments (shown to be independent on the level positions), we found in our previous\nexperiments [108] that the activation law applies over the whole range of noise\nintensities that we are using.\nFor weak noise the spectral density of fluctuations (SDF) at the output of the OB\nsystem is defined as\nQ(\u03c9) =\n1\n4piT\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u222b +T\n\u2212T\ndt ei\u03c9tIT (t)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\nT \u2192\u221e. (1.6)\nFor small noise intensities the system spends most of the time fluctuating near the\nstable positions, and interwell transitions occur only occasionally. Q(\u03c9) can then be\nrepresented as the sum of partial contributions from vibrations about the equilibrium\npositions xn weighted with the populations of the corresponding stable states wn,\nand from interwell transitions. The intrawell contribution takes the form\nQ(0)n (\u03c9) = N\n\u20322(\u03c6n)I\u00af\n2\nin\nD\npi\n1\nU \u2032\u2032n + \u03c9\n2\n.

This peak arises from the fluctuation-induced\ntransitions between the stable states of the system and is of Lorentzian shape\nQ\n(0)\ntr (\u03c9) =\nw1w2\npi\n(I\u00afT1 \u2212 I\u00afT2)2 W12 +W21\n(W12 +W21)2 + \u03c92\n, I\u00afTn \u2261 N(\u03c6n)I\u00afin (1.8)\nThe onset of this peak is closely related to stochastic resonance, which can occur if\na weak periodic signal is added to the input.\n1.2.3 Stochastic resonance in an OB system\nFor an OB system driven by a combination of the stochastic reference beam and the\nperiodically modulated input beam (Iin(t) = I\u00afin + A cos\u2126t), the equation for the\nphase takes on the form\n\u03c6\u02d9+ U \u2032(\u03c6) =M(\u03c6)A cos(\u2126t) + \u2206I(t), (1.9)\nxii FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\n0 0.04 0.08\n0\n4\n8\n12\n16\n Noise\n \nSN\nR\n0 0.02 0.04\n0\n1\n2\n Noise\n \nSi\ngn\nal\n (m\nW\n)\nFig. 1.3 Signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in the optical experiment for a signal at frequency\n\u2126 = 3.9Hz as a function of the internal noise intensity [114]. Inset: the corresponding signal\namplification.\nTo first order in A the intensity of the transmitted radiation is given by\n\u3008IT (t)\u3009 = I\u00afT +ARe [\u03c7(\u2126) exp(\u2212i\u2126t)]\nwhere \u03c7(\u2126) is the susceptibility. As a result of the periodic term in the intensity of\nthe outgoing radiation there arises a \u03b4-spike in the SDF (1.6), with the area equal\nto (1\/4)A2|\u03c7(\u2126)|2. For low noise intensity D, when the system spends most of its\ntime fluctuating about the stable states n = 1, 2, the susceptibility (like the SDF) is\ngiven by the sum of contributions from the vibrations about these states \u03c7n(\u2126) and\nthe term \u03c7tr(\u2126) that results from the periodic modulation of the populations by the\nforce A exp(\u2212i\u2126t).\nFor \u2126 \u226a \u03c4\u22121 the intrawell susceptibilities correspond to quasistatic forcing,\nand can easily be obtained by linearising the equation of motion near the stable\nstates. To calculate the interwell contribution to lowest order in A\/D, one has to\nfind corrections to the escape probabilities Wnm, which can be easily done using a\npath-integral formulation, solving the corresponding variational problem (see [82]),\nand calculating the periodic redistribution over the wells, using balance equations.\nThe resulting expression in the case of additive noise in the OB system takes the form\n\u03c7(\u2126) =\n\u2211\nn=1,2\nM(\u03c6n)\n\u2202I\u00afTn\n\u2202I\u00afref\nwn (1.10)\nSTOCHASTIC RESONANCE AND NOISE-PROTECTED HETERODYNING xiii\n+\nw1w2\nD\n(I\u00afT1 \u2212 I\u00afT2) W12 +W21\n(W12 +W21)\u2212 i\u2126\n\u03c62\u222b\n\u03c61\nd\u03c6\u2032M(\u03c6\u2032)\nIn general, the SDF at low frequency is a superposition of a \u03b4-function peak at the\nfrequency \u2126, the zero-frequency peak, and a broad, smoothly varying background\n(at \u03c9\u03c4 \u226a 1), which is proportional to D and which is small if D is small.\nAccording to [12, 13, 19, 96], the two principal features of stochastic resonance\nphenomena are that the signal and\/or the signal-to-noise ratio R\nR =\n1\n4\nA2|\u03c7(\u2126)|2\/Q(0)(\u2126) (A\u2192 0), (1.11)\ncan be enhanced by adding noise to the system, and display resonance-like behaviour\nin a certain range of noise intensities. It follows from Eqs. (1.11) and (1.11) that\nthe signal and R in OB system indeed increase sharply with D if the heights of the\n\u201cpotential barriers\" satisfy \u2206U1,2 \u226b D, because the probabilities of fluctuational\ntransitions (1.3) sharply increase with noise intensity.\nThese particular effects have been observed experimentally [114]. A sinusoidal\nsignal at a frequency of 3.9 Hz was applied to an electro-optic modulator to modulate\nthe input signal at wavelength 514.5 nm, while the intensity of the 488 nm radiation\nwas modulated with noise. It is clearly seen from the Fig. 1.3 that the signal and\nR (for the transmitted light intensity at wavelength 514.5 nm) increase sharply in\ncertain range of the noise amplitudeD. Outside this rangeR decreases with increase\nof D.\nBut, as mentioned above in Sec. 1.1, the mechanism of bistable stochastic res-\nonance requires that the frequency of the input signal is much less than reciprocal\nrelaxation time of the system.\n1.2.4 Noise-enhanced optical heterodyning.\nWe now consider the case where two high-frequency fields are mixing nonlinearly in\nthe OB system to generate a heterodyne signal. The equation of motion for the OB\nsystem takes the form\n\u03c6\u02d9+ U \u2032(\u03c6) =M(\u03c6)Ain(t) cos(\u03c90t+ \u03c8(t)) +Aref cos(\u03c90t) + \u2206I(t), (1.12)\nwhere \u03c90 is a high frequency (\u226b \u03c4\u22121) and Ain(t), \u03c8(t) are the slowly-varying\namplitude and phase of the modulated input signal, respectively.\nIn the most interesting and practically important case, when the frequency \u03c90\nis much higher than the reciprocal relaxation time of the system, simple analytical\nresults can be obtained in the spirit of [115]. If the characteristic frequency of\nthe modulation \u2126 \u2261 \u03c8\u02d9, and A\u02d9in\/Ain \u226a \u03c4\u22121 \u226a \u03c90, the response consists of a\ncomparatively slow motion \u03c6(sl) with fast oscillations at frequency \u03c90 superimposed\nxiv FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\non it. We therefore seek a solution in the form\n\u03c6(t) = \u03c6(sl)(t) + \u03c6(1)(t). (1.13)\n\u03c6(1)(t) = \u03c9\u221210\n[\nAref sin\u03c90t+M(\u03c6\n(sl))Ain sin(\u03c90t+\u2126t))\n]\n, (\u03c8\u02d9 \u2261 \u2126)\nBecause of the nonlinearity of M(\u03c6), the oscillations induced by the two beams\nproduce a slowly varying heterodyne force driving the slow motion,\n\u03c6\u02d9(sl) + U \u2032\n(\n\u03c6(sl)\n)\n= \u2212AeffM \u2032\n(\n\u03c6(sl)\n)\nsin\u2126t+\u2206I(t) (1.14)\nAeff =\nArefAin(t)\n2\u03c90\nThus we have reduced this problem to the form of conventional SR (see Sec. 1.2.3)\nwith only a renormalized effective amplitude for the input signal Aeff (cf Eq. (1.9))\nand the function M(\u03c6) replaced by its derivative M \u2032(\u03c6) in the first term on the\nright hand side. By analogy with standard SR, the SNR for heterodyning can be\ncharacterized by the ratio R of the low-frequency signal in the intensity of the\ntransmitted radiation, given by 14A\n2\neff |\u03c7(\u2126)|2, to the value of the power spectrum\nQ(0)(\u2126) (with Q(0)(\u2126) given by (1.7), (1.8)). The susceptibility of the system can\nbe easily calculated and takes the form\n\u03c7(\u2126) =\n\u2211\nn=1,2\nwn(N\n\u2032(\u03c6n) +M\n\u2032(\u03c6n)\n\u2202I\u00afTn\n\u2202I\u00afref\n) (1.15)\n+\nw1w2\nD\n(I\u00afT1 \u2212 I\u00afT2)(M(\u03c61)\u2212M(\u03c62)) W12 +W21\n(W12 +W21)\u2212 i\u2126\nSimilar to what happens in conventional SR, the heterodyne signal and its signal-\nto-noise ratio can be amplified by adding noise to the system, thus manifesting the\nnew phenomenon of noise-enhanced optical heterodyning.\nThese theoretical predictions were first tested in analog simulations for Brownian\nmotion in the symmetric Duffing potential withM(\u03c6) \u2261 \u03c6 [28]. It was found that the\nheterodyne signal amplitude and correspondingR could be enhanced by adding noise\nto the system for the cases both of white noise and of broad-band high-frequency\nnoise (i.e. noise with a power spectrum centered near the high frequency \u03c90 with\nhalf width \u2206\u03c9 : \u03c4\u22121 \u226a \u2206\u03c9 \u226a \u03c90). The specific dependences of the renormalized\namplitude of the heterodyne signalAeff on the amplitudes and frequency of the input\nand reference signals were found to be in good agreement with the theory as shown\nin Fig. 1.4. To investigate noise-enhanced optical heterodyning in the DCMS, the\n488 nm reference signal was modulated periodically at frequency \u03c90 = 2.1 kHz and\nin addition by noise with a cut-off frequency of 5 kHz. The 514.5 nm input signal\nwas modulated at frequencies \u03c90 \u00b1 \u2126 = 2.1\u00b1 0.0039 kHz.

The dependence\nofR on the noise intensity is of the characteristic reversed-N shape familiar from SR\nin bistable systems and consistent with the theory given above.

Just occasionally, however, it will undergo a much larger departure before\ncoming back or perhaps, in some cases, making a transition to the vicinity of a differ-\nent stable state. Despite their rarity, these large fluctuations are of great importance\nin diverse contexts including, for example, nucleation at phase transitions, chemical\nreactions, mutations in DNA sequences, protein transport in biological cells, and\nfailures of electronic devices. As already mentioned above, there are many cases\nof practical interest where the fluctuating system is far from thermal equilibrium.\nExamples include lasers [46], pattern-forming systems [47], trapped electrons which\ndisplay bistability and switching in a strong periodic field [48, 50], and Brown-\nian ratchets [116] which can support a unidirectional current under nonequilibrium\nconditions. In general, the analysis of the behaviour of nonequilibrium systems is\ndifficult, there being no general relations from which the stationary distribution or\nthe probability of fluctuations can be obtained.\nThe most promising approach to the analysis of large fluctuations is through the\nconcept of the optimal path [42, 57, 61, 65, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121]. This is the\npath that the system is predicted to follow with overwhelming probability during\nthe course of the fluctuation. For many years it remained unclear how the optimal\nOPTIMAL PATHS, LARGE FLUCTUATIONS, AND IRREVERSIBILITY xvii\npath \u2013 calculated as a trajectory of an auxiliary Hamiltonian system (see below) \u2013\nis related to the behaviour of real fluctuating systems. Recently, however, through\nthe introduction and use of the prehistory probability distribution [60] (see also\n[122]), it has been demonstrated that optimal paths are physical observables that\ncan be measured experimentally for both equilibrium [60] and nonequilibrium [123]\nsystems. In what follows we review briefly what has been achieved and point out\nthe opportunities that have now appeared for making rapid scientific progress in this\nburgeoning research field.\n1.3.2 Theory\nConsider an overdamped system driven by a periodic force K(q;\u03c6) and white noise\n\u03be(t), with equation of motion\nq\u02d9 = K(q;\u03c6) + \u03be(t), K(q;\u03c6) = K(q;\u03c6+ 2pi),\n\u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6(t) = \u03c9t+ \u03c60; \u3008\u03be(t)\u03be(t\u2032)\u3009 = D\u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032). (1.16)\nThe familiar overdamped bistable oscillator driven by a periodic force provides a\nsimple example of the kind of system we have in mind:\nq\u02d9 = \u2212U \u2032(q) +A cos\u03c9t+ \u03be(t),\nU(q) = \u22121\n2\nq2 +\n1\n4\nq4. (1.17)\nWe consider a situation that is both nonadiabatic and nonlinear : neither \u03c9 nor A\nneed be small; only the noise intensity D will be assumed small. We investigate\nrare fluctuations to a remote point (qf , \u03c6f ), coming from the metastable state within\nwhose domain of attraction (qf , \u03c6f ) is located. The position of the stable state q(0)(t)\nis itself a periodic function of time,\nq\u02d9(0) = K(q(0);\u03c6), q(0)\n(\nt+ 2pi\u03c9\u22121\n)\n= q(0)(t). (1.18)\nThe equations for optimal paths can be found using the eikonal approximation to solve\nthe corresponding Fokker-Plank equation, or by using a path integral formulation\nand evaluating the path integral over the fluctuational paths in the steepest descent\napproximation (for details and discussion see [42, 57, 64, 65, 71, 72, 73, 117]). The\noptimal path of a periodically driven system corresponds to the locus traced out by\nthe maximum in the prehistory probability density, ph(q, \u03c6| qf , \u03c6f ) [60, 123]. This\nis the probability density that a system arriving at the point (qf , \u03c6f ) at the instant tf\n(\u03c6(tf ) = \u03c6f ) had passed through the point q, \u03c6 at the instant t (t < tf ). A particular\nadvantage of this formulation is that ph is a physical quantity that can be measured\nexperimentally. The approach can be extended to include the analysis of singular\npoints in the pattern of optimal paths.\nxviii FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\nUsing the path-integral expression for the transition probability density [64], one\ncan write ph in the form [60]\nph(q, \u03c6| qf , \u03c6f ) = C\n\u222b q(tf )=qf\nq(ti)\u2248q(0)(ti)\nDq(t\u2032) \u03b4(q(t)\u2212 q)\n\u00d7 exp\n[\n\u2212S[q(t)]\nD\n\u2212 1\n2\n\u222b tf\nti\ndt\u2032\n\u2202K\n\u2202q\n]\n, ti \u2192 \u2212\u221e (1.19)\n\u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6(t), \u03c6f \u2261 \u03c6(tf ).\nHere, C is a normalization constant determined by the condition\n\u222b\ndq ph(q, \u03c6| qf , \u03c6f ) = 1.\nS[q(t)] has the form of an action functional for an auxiliary dynamical system with\ntime-dependent Lagrangian L(q\u02d9, q;\u03c6):\nS[q(t)] =\n\u222b tf\nti\ndt L(q\u02d9, q;\u03c6), L(q\u02d9, q;\u03c6) =\n1\n2\n[q\u02d9 \u2212K(q;\u03c6)]2. (1.20)\nIn the range of small noise intensities D, the optimal path qopt(t| qf , \u03c6f ) to the\npoint (qf , \u03c6f ) is given by the condition that the action S be minimal. The variational\nproblem forS to be extremal gives Hamiltonian equations of motion for the coordinate\nq and momentum p of the auxiliary system\ndq\ndt\n=\n\u2202H\n\u2202p\n,\ndp\ndt\n= \u2212\u2202H\n\u2202q\n,\ndS\ndt\n=\n1\n2\np2\nH \u2261 H(q, p;\u03c6) = 1\n2\np2 + pK(q;\u03c6), (1.21)\nH(q, p;\u03c6) = H(q, p;\u03c6+ 2pi).\nThe boundary conditions for the extreme paths (1.21) follow from (1.19) and (1.20)\nq(tf ) = qf ; (1.22)\nq(ti)\u2192 q(0)(ti), p(ti)\u2192 0, S(ti)\u2192 0 for ti \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\nSince the HamiltonianH(q, p;\u03c6) is periodic in \u03c6, the set of paths {q(t), p(t)} is also\nperiodic: the paths that arrive at a point (qf , \u03c6f + 2pi) are the same as the paths\nthat arrive at the point (qf , \u03c6f ), but shifted in time by the period 2pi\/\u03c9. The action\nS(qf , \u03c6f ) evaluated along the extreme paths is also periodic as a function of the phase\n\u03c6f of the final point (qf , \u03c6f ). The function S(q, \u03c6) satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation\n\u03c9\n\u2202S\n\u2202\u03c6\n= \u2212H\n(\nq,\n\u2202S\n\u2202q\n;\u03c6\n)\n, p \u2261 \u2202S\n\u2202q\n,\nOPTIMAL PATHS, LARGE FLUCTUATIONS, AND IRREVERSIBILITY xix\nS(q, \u03c6) = S(q, \u03c6+ 2pi). (1.23)\nIt is straightforward to see that the extreme paths obtained by solving (1.21) form a\none-parameter set. It is known from the theory of dynamical systems (see for instance\n[124]) that trajectories emanating from a stationary state lie on a Lagrangian manifold\n(LM) in phase space (q, \u03c6, p = \u2202S\/\u2202q) (the unstable manifold of the corresponding\nstate) and form a one-parameter set. The action S(q, t) is a smooth single-valued\nfunction of position on the LM. It is a Lyapunov function: it is nondecreasing along\nthe trajectories of the initial system in the absence of noise q\u02d9 = K(q;\u03c6). Therefore\nS(q, t) may be viewed as a generalised nonequilibrium thermodynamic potential for\na fluctuating dynamical system [64]. The projections of trajectories in phase space\nonto configuration space form the extreme paths. Optimal paths are the extreme\npaths that give the minimal action to a given point in the configuration space. These\nare the optimal paths that can be visualised in an experiment via measurements of\nthe prehistory probability distribution.\nFig. 1.6 From top to bottom: action surface; Lagrangian manifold (LM); and extreme paths\ncalculated [80] for the system (1.17) using equations (1.21). The parameters for the system\nwere A=0.264 and \u03c9=1.2. To clarify interrelations between singularities in the pattern of\noptimal paths, action surface, and LM surface, they are shown in a single figure, as follows:\nthe action surface has been shifted up by one unit; and the LM has been scaled by a factor 1\/2\nand shifted up by 0.4.\nThe pattern of extreme paths, LM, and action surfaces for an overdamped peri-\nodically driven oscillator (1.17) are shown in Fig. 1.6. The figure illustrates generic\ntopological features of the pattern in question. It can be seen from Fig. 1.6 that,\nalthough there is only one path to a point (q, \u03c6, p) in phase space, several different\nxx FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\nextreme paths may come from the stationary periodic state to the corresponding point\n(q, \u03c6) in configuration space. These paths cross each other. This is a consequence of\nthe folding of the Lagrangian manifold.\nA generic feature related to folding of LMs is the occurrence of caustics in the\npattern of extreme paths. Caustics are projections of the folds of an LM. They start\nat cusp points. It is clear from Fig. 1.6 that an LM structure with two folds merging\nat the cusp must give rise to a local swallowtail singularity in the action surface.\nThe spinode edges of the action surface correspond to the caustics. A switching line\nemanates from the cusp point at which two caustics meet. This is the projection of the\nline in phase space along which the two lowest sheets of the action surface intersect.\nThe switching line separates regions which are reached along different optimal paths,\nand the optimal paths intersect on the switching line. The intersection occurs prior to\na caustic being encountered by the optimal path. The formation of the singularities,\navoidance of caustics, and formation of switching lines were analyzed numerically\nin [118], and a complete theory was given in [119]. Until very recently, the generic\ntopological features of the pattern of optimal paths had not been observed in any\nexperiment. We now describe briefly the experimental technique [123] that enables\nthe pattern of optimal paths and its singularities to be observed, and we present and\ndiscuss some of our initial results.\n1.3.3 Experiments\nThe experiments are based on analog electronic circuits designed in the usual way\n[112, 125] to model the system of interest, and then driven by appropriate external\nforces. Their response is measured and analysed digitally to create the statistical\nquantity of interest which, in the present case, was usually a prehistory probability\ndistribution [60, 123]. We again emphasize that such experiments provide a valid\ntest of the theory, and that the theory should in this case be universally applicable\nto any system described by (1.16), including natural systems, technological ones, or\nthe electronic models studied here. Some experiments on a model of (1.17) are now\ndescribed and discussed as an illustrative example of what can already be achieved.\nThe model was driven continuously by external quasi-white noise from a noise\ngenerator and by a periodic force from a frequency synthesiser. The fluctuating\nvoltage representing q(t) was digitized and analysed in discrete blocks of 32768\nsamples using a Nicolet NIC-1180 data-processor. The input sweeps were triggered\nby the frequency synthesiser so that information about the phase of the periodic force\ncould be retained. Whenever q(t) entered a designated square centred on a particular\n(qf , \u03c6f ) value, the immediately preceding part of the trajectory was collected and\nstored; in cases where relaxation trajectories were also of interest, the immediately\nfollowing part of the trajectory was preserved too. The trajectories that had arrived\nin any chosen square could subsequently be ensemble-averaged together to create\nthe prehistory probability distribution ph(q, \u03c6|qf , \u03c6f ) corresponding to the chosen\n(qf , \u03c6f ), with or without the relaxational tail back towards the stable state.\nBecause the fluctuations of interest were \u2013 by definition \u2013 rare, it was usually\nnecessary to continue the data acquisition process for several weeks in order to build\nOPTIMAL PATHS, LARGE FLUCTUATIONS, AND IRREVERSIBILITY xxi\n\u22124 \u22122 0 2 4\n\u22121.2\n\u22120.8\n\u22120.4\n0\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n Time\n x\n \nP(\nx,t\n)\nFig. 1.7 The prehistory probability density ph(x, t;xf , 0) [60] for (1.17), measured [62]\nfor A = 0 in the analog electronic experiment for a final position xf = \u22120.30 with D =\n0.0701.\nup acceptably smooth distributions. For this reason, the analysis algorithm was\ndesigned to enable trajectories to several termination squares (not just one) to be\nsought in parallel: an 8 \u00d7 8 matrix of 64 adjacent termination squares, each centred\non a different (qf , \u03c6f ) was scanned.\nExperimentally measured ph for the system (1.17) for two qualitatively different\nsituations are shown in Figs. 1.7 and 1.8. It is immediately evident: (i) that the\nprehistory distributions are sharp and have well defined ridges; (ii) that the ridges\nfollow very closely the theoretical trajectories obtained by solving numerically the\nequations of motion for the optimal paths, shown by the full curves on the top-planes.\nIt is important to compare the fluctuational path bringing the system to (qf , \u03c6f ) with\nthe relaxational path back towards the stable state in thermal equilibrium, Fig. 1.7,\nand away from it, Fig. 1.8. Fig. 1.7 plots the distribution for the system (1.17) in\nthermal equilibrium, i.e. A=0. The ridges of a distribution are compared with the\ncalculated fluctuational and relaxational paths at the top of the figure. The time\nreversal symmetry [44] between these paths can be clearly seen. Fig. 1.8 plots the\nph and the ridges of a distribution recorded for the special situation that arises when\nthe termination point lies on the switching line [123]. In figure, the time dependent\nstable and unstable states bear x = \u22121 and x = 0 are shown by dashed lines on the\ntop. The data are compared to the (theoretical) fluctuational paths, calculated from\n(1.21), shown as full lines. It can be seen: that there are two distinct paths via which\nthe system can arrive at (qf , \u03c6f ) but only one relaxational path taking it back to the\nstable state. Unlike the behaviour expected and seen [62] in equilibrium systems,\nneither of the fluctuational paths is a time-reversed image of the relaxational one.\nxxii FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\n1\n5\n9\n\u22121.5\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n0\n1\n2\nx 10\u22123\n Time\n x\n \nP(\nx,t\n)\nFig. 1.8 Fluctuational behaviour measured and calculated for an electronic model of the\nnonequilibrium system (1.17) with A = 0.264, D = 0.012. The main figure plots the\nprehistory probability density ph(x, t;xf , 0) and posthistory distribution to\/from the remote\nstate xf = \u22120.63, t = 0.83, which lies on the switching line. In the top-plane, the\nfluctuational (squares) and relaxational (circles) optimal paths to\/from this remote state were\ndetermined by tracing the ridges of the distribution [62].\nNote that there are two equally probable fluctuational paths to arrive on a switching\nline, they form a so called corral [123].\nAlthough the system (1.17) is relatively simple, it describes very well the fluctua-\ntional dynamics of many real physical systems. In particular, a behaviour qualitatively\nsimilar to the one shown in Fig. 1.7 was observed recently in the experiments with\nsemiconductor lasers [83, 84].\nIn the work by Hales and co-authors [83] the prehistory distribution was observed\nexperimentally using a semiconductor laser with optical feedback. Near the solitary\nthreshold, the system was unstable: after a period of nearly steady operation, the\nradiation intensity decreased; then it recovered comparatively quickly, growing to\nregain its original value; decreased again; and the cycle repeated. In the experiment,\nthe output intensity was digitized with 1 ns resolution. The ph obtained in [83] from\n1512 events is shown in Fig. 1.9. The results were compared with the results of\nnumerical simulation for the system (1.17).\nIn the work by Willemsen and co-authors [84] the three Stokes polarization pa-\nrameters were studied during polarization switches in a vertical-cavity semiconductor\nlaser. It was demonstrated that when the linear part of the absorptive anisotropy is\nclose to zero [126], the laser is bistable and switches stochastically between two\npolarisations [127]. The analysis of large fluctuations of polarizations in this sys-\ntem [84] reveals what authors have called a \u201cstochastic inversion symmetry\" (see\nOPTIMAL PATHS, LARGE FLUCTUATIONS, AND IRREVERSIBILITY xxiii\n\u221220\n\u221210\n0\n1\n0.50.5\n1\nI\n0\n-10\n-20\n-6\n-12\n0\n0\n1\nq\nPr\neh\nist\nor\ny \nPr\nob\nab\nili\nty\n D\nen\nsit\ny\nt (ns)\nt \/ tr\nFig. 1.9 Bottom: The prehistory probability distribution of the radiation intensity I (in\narbitrary units) for dropout events in a semiconductor laser.

We can investigate the pattern of optimal paths for thermally nonequilibrium\nsystems and reveal its singularities including, in particular, switching lines and strong\n(nonanalytic in the noise intensity) smearing of the prehistory probability distribution\nnear cusp points. The particular system we have investigated has the least number of\ndegrees of freedom necessary to observe these singularities, and therefore it is most\nappropriate for analysis in these initial investigations. The approach that we have\ndescribed is in principle applicable to any nonequilibrium system, and we believe it\nwill be found useful in a wide range of applications.\nxxiv FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n0,0\n0,5\n1,0\n0,5\n1,0\n0,5\n1,0\n1\/\n2(1\n+\ns 3\n \n) \n[ar\nb.\n \nu\nn\nits\n]\ntime [ns]\n1\/\n2(1\n+\ns 2\n \n) \n[ar\nb.\n \nu\nn\nits\n]\n \n1\/\n2(1\n+\ns 1\n \n) \n[ar\nb.\n \nu\nn\nits\n]\nFig. 1.10 Time-resolved measurements of a very large polarisation fluctuation, where the\nsize of the fluctuation is about half (in fact, 45%)of that of a complete polarisation switch [84].\ns1, s2 and s3 are the normalized Stockes parameters representing the polarization state on the\nPoincare\u00b4 sphere [84].\nIt should also be clear that the structures predicted by the theory are indeed\nobserved in real systems. Reasoning along these lines, researchers have recently\nstarted predicting peculiar features which should be observable in real systems, on the\nbasis of the topology of corresponding Lagrangian manifold. These include features\npredicted on the assumption that the optimal path (and the corresponding fluctuation\nin the real system) takes place over a finite time range [132, 133, 134, 135, 136].\nOne of the most striking effects predicted on this basis is perhaps what occurs in\nnoise induced escape from a metastable well on a time scale preceding the formation\nof a quasi-equilibrium distribution within the metastable part of the potential (see\n[135, 136] for more details), which we now review briefly.\nIn his seminal work [109], Kramers considered the noise-induced flux from a\nsingle metastable potential well i.e. he considered a Brownian particle\nq\u00a8 + \u0393q\u02d9 + dU\/dq = f(t), (1.24)\n\u3008f(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008f(t)f(t\u2032)\u3009 = 2\u0393T\u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032),\nwhich was put initially at the bottom of a metastable potential well U(q) and then he\ncalculated the quasi-stationary probability flux beyond an absorbing barrier. There\nhave been many developments and generalizations of the Kramers problem (see\nOPTIMAL PATHS, LARGE FLUCTUATIONS, AND IRREVERSIBILITY xxv\n[137, 138] for reviews) but both he and most of those who followed him considered\njust the quasi-stationary flux, i.e. the flux established after the formation of a quasi-\nstationary distribution within the well (up to the barrier). The quasi-stationary flux is\ncharacterized by a slow exponential decay, an Arrhenius dependence on temperature\nT , and a relatively weak dependence on friction \u0393:\nJqs(t) = \u03b1escapee\n\u2212\u03b1escapet, \u03b1escape = P e\n\u2212\u2206U\nT , (1.25)\nwhere P depends on \u0393 and T in a non-activation manner.\nBut how does the flux evolve from its zero value at the initial moment to its\nquasi-stationary value at time-scales exceeding the time tf for the formation of\nquasi-equilibrium? It is obvious that the answer may depend on initial conditions.\nThe most natural are those corresponding to the stable stationary state of the noise-\nfree system i.e. (q = qbottom, q\u02d9 = 0) where qbottom is the coordinate of the bottom\nof the potential well. We assume such an initial state here. If the noise is switched\non suddenly (e.g. if the thermal isolation of a frozen system is broken) then the\ntime evolution of the escape flux from the noise-free metastable initial state is highly\nrelevant. It might seem natural that the evolution from zero to the quasi-stationary\nvalue should be smooth. Such an assumption might also seem to have been confirmed\nrecently by Schneidman [139] who found that, for both the strongly underdamped\nand overdamped cases, the escape flux from a single metastable well grows with\ntime t smoothly, at t \u223c tf . But does this exhaust the problem? We can prove\ntheoretically, and demonstrate experimentally, that there are some generic situations\nwhen the escape flux behaves in a quite different manner.\nOur prediction are based, as mentioned, on an extensive use of the method of\noptimal fluctuation within which an escape rate is sought in the form\n\u03b1escape = P e\n\u2212 S\nT (1.26)\nwhere the action S does not depend on T ; the prefactor P does depend on T , but\nrelatively weakly. The action S is related to a certain optimal fluctuation which, in\nturn, corresponds to the most probable escape path (MPEP).\nThe quasi-stationary flux is formed by optimal fluctuations which bring the system\nfrom the bottom of the well to the saddle during an optimal time\ntopt \u223c 1\nmin(\u0393, \u03c90)\nln\n(\n\u2206U\nT\n)\n, (1.27)\nwhere \u03c90 is the frequency of eigenoscillation in the bottom of the well.\nAt much shorter time-scales, t \u226a topt, the flux is necessarily formed by optimal\nfluctuations strongly differing from those of duration topt, and the smaller t the\nmore marked this difference becomes. Thus, in the range (1.27), S depends on t.\nMoreover, it can be shown rigorously that if \u0393 < \u0393c where \u0393c is typically equal to\n2\u03c90, then S(t) is a step-wise function: see the example in Fig. 1.11. The vertical\nand horizontal positions of the center of the step S(t) number n (counted from the\nleft) equal respectively \u2206U\u03c90\/(npi\u0393) and npi\/\u03c90, provided npi\u0393 \u226a \u03c90.

The dash-dotted line shows in (a) the MPEP corresponding to some\narbitrarily chosen time t = 4.51 (see (b)) and demonstrates, in particular, that the escape\nvelocity is generally non-zero. The inset shows the experimental dependence of the flux on\ntime, for T = \u2206U [135, 136].\nwhen the shape of the potential well departs from parabolicity, the equalities turn into\napproximations. Thus, in the range (1.27), J depends exponentially strongly both on\n\u0393 and on t (c.f. the inset of Fig. 1.11).\n1.4 LOGARITHMIC SUSCEPTIBILITY\nA very good example of the usefulness of the concept of the optimal path is the idea\nof the logarithm susceptibility (LS) [56, 87, 140].\nUnderlying the theory of the LS [56, 87] is the realization that, although the motion\nof the fluctuating system is random, large rare fluctuations from a metastable state to\na remote state, or during escape, take place in an almost deterministic manner: the\nsystem is overwhelmingly most likely to move along a particular trajectory known\nas the optimal path (see [42, 57, 64, 69, 120] and references therein). The effect of\na comparatively weak field on the escape probability can therefore be understood in\nterms of the work that the field does on the system as it moves along the optimal\npath. One may expect this work to be related to the field-induced change in the\nLOGARITHMIC SUSCEPTIBILITY xxvii\nactivation energy R for the corresponding large fluctuation. This change is linear\nin the field, provided that the field-induced change of the optimal path itself is\nnegligible. It follows from these arguments that in the case of periodic driving\nF (t) =\n\u2211\nk Fk exp(ik\u2126t), the leading-order correction \u03b4R to the activation energy\nof escape is\n\u03b4R = min\ntc\n\u03b4R(tc), \u03b4R(tc) =\n\u2211\nk\nFk\u03c7\u02dc(k\u2126)e\nik\u2126tc ,\n\u03c7\u02dc(\u2126) = \u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndt q\u02d9(0)(t)ei\u2126t, q\u02d9(0) = U \u2032(q(0)). (1.28)\nHere, \u03c7\u02dc(\u2126) is the LS for escape. It is given [56, 87] by the Fourier transform of\nthe velocity along the most probable escape path q(0)(t) in the absence of driving\n(F (t) = 0). The path q(0)(t) is an instanton [122]: it starts for t \u2192 \u2212\u221e at the\nmetastable minimum qs of the potential U(q) and goes for t \u2192 \u221e to the top qu\nof the potential barrier over which the particle escapes. The minimization over tc\ncorresponds to choosing the position of the center of the instanton so as to maximize\nthe work the fieldF (t) does on the system along the escape path q(0)(t\u2212tc). We have\nalready noted that, for Markov systems in thermal equilibrium, optimal fluctuational\npaths are the time-reversed relaxational paths in the absence of noise [44, 130, 141].\nUnlike the standard linear susceptibility [9] which, on causality arguments, is given\nby a Fourier integral over time from 0 to \u221e, the LS \u03c7\u02dc(\u2126) is given by an integral\nfrom \u2212\u221e to \u221e. The analytic properties of \u03c7\u02dc(\u2126) therefore differ from those of\nthe standard susceptibility, and in particular their high-frequency asymptotics are\nqualitatively different. The standard susceptibility for damped dynamical systems\ndecays as a power law for large \u2126 (e.g., as 1\/[U \u2032\u2032(qs)\u2212 i\u2126], for the model of damped\nDuffing oscillator). In contrast, from (1.28) the LS decreases exponentially fast,\n\u03c7\u02dc(\u2126) =Me\u2212|\u2126|\u03c4p , \u03c4p = min\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Im\n\u222b\ndq\/U \u2032(q)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 . (1.29)\nHere, the integral is taken from any point in the interval (qs, qu) to the (complex)\nposition qp of the appropriate singularity of U \u2032(q). Note that q\u02d9(0)(t \u2212 tc) for given\nreal tc has a pole or a branching point at Im t = \u03c4p. The prefactor M depends on\nthe form of U(q) near qp and can be obtained in a standard way. In particular, for a\npolynomial potential (|qp| \u2192 \u221e) with U(q) = Cqn\/n for |q| \u2192 \u221e, we have\n|M | = 2pi|\u2126\/C|\u03bd |\u03bd|\u03bd+1\/\u03bd!, \u03bd = 1\/(n\u2212 2).

It has now become possible to use the prehistory\nformulation [60] as a basis for experiments on fluctuational dynamics. The work\non Markov systems presented in this section has already verified several longstand-\ning theoretical predictions, including symmetry between the growth and decay of\nclassical fluctuations [44], the breaking of this symmetry under non-equilibrium con-\nditions [57, 59, 65, 118], the relationship between lack of detailed balance and onset\nof singularities in the pattern of optimal paths, as well as the character of these singu-\nlarities [119, 120, 121, 123, 143], including occurrence of switching between optimal\npaths and critical broadening of the paths distribution. It has now become possible to\napply this theory and the corresponding experimental methods to the analysis of the\nfluctuational dynamics in optical systems and to develop new methods of controlling\nthem.\n1.5 CHAOTIC ESCAPE AND THE PROBLEM OF OPTIMAL CONTROL\nOne of the main problem in the dynamics of optical systems is that of controlling the\nsystem dynamics [144]. The difficulties in solving such a problem depend on many\nfactors. A typical optical system is characterised by the phenomenon of multistability\n[145, 146, 147, 148], i.e. the co-existence of a relatively small number of distinct\ndynamical regimes that are defined by the initial conditions. Because real optical\nsystems are always subject to random fluctuations [46, 146], spontaneous transitions\nof the system take place from one regime to another. It is obviously desirable\nto be able to control these transitions. Moreover, in optical systems non-regular\noscillations are often observed which are chaotic and can be described by the theory\nof deterministic chaos [144, 146, 148]; such non-regular oscillations in the phase\nspace of the system can be characterised by a chaotic attractor. The transformation of\nthe system dynamics from a chaotic regime to a regular regime is also an interesting\nproblem in dynamical control. In solving it for real systems, it is essential to take\ninto account of fluctuations.\nThe need to be able to control chaos has attracted considerable attention recently.\nMethods already available include a variety of minimal forms of interaction [149,\n150, 151, 152, 153, 154] and methods of strong control [155, 156] which necessarily\nrequire a large modification of the system\u2019s dynamics, for at least a limited period\nof time. For example, in [157, 158] the procedure of controlling chaos by means of\nminimal forms of interaction (of saddle cycles stabilization) is realized for different\nlaser systems.\nxxx FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\nAt the same time the energy-optimal directing of the motion away from a chaotic\nattractor (CA) to another coexisting attractor has remained an important unsolved\nproblem of long standing. Its solution would be an important extension of the range\nof model-exploration objectives (c.f. [155] and [153]) achievable through minimal\ncontrol techniques and has a variety of applications for controlling the dynamics of\nmultistable optical systems [146].\nIn this section the application of the optimal path approach to the problem of\nescape from a non-hyperbolic and from a quasi-hyperbolic attractor is examined. We\ndiscuss these two different types of chaotic attractor because it is known [159] that\nnoise does not change very much the structure and properties of quasi-hyperbolic\nattractors, but that the structure of non-hyperbolic attractors is abruptly changed in\nthe presence of noise, with a strong dependence on noise intensity. Note that for\noptical systems both types of chaotic attractor [160, 161, 162] (non-hyperbolic and\nquasi-hyperbolic) are observed, but a non-hyperbolic attractor is much more typical.\n1.5.1 Escape from a non-hyperbolic attractor\n1.5.1.1 Introduction to the optimal control problem Consider a system of the\nform\nx\u02d9 = f(x, u, t), (1.31)\nwith the state variable x \u2208 Rn, and an admissible control function u \u2208 Rm in\nthe control set U . Assume that it is desired to transfer the system from the state\nX0 = x(t0) to the terminal state X1 = x(t1) in such a way that the (\u201ccost\u201d)\nfunctional\nJ = min\n\u222b t1\nt0\nf0(x, u, t)dt (1.32)\nis minimized, with t1 unspecified. Let (u(t), x(t)) be a solution of this problem.\nThen there exist continuous piece-wise differentiable functions y0(t), ..., yn(t) which\nare not simultaneously zero and which satisfy together with the functions xi(t) the\ndifferential equations (see e.g. [163])\nx\u02d9i =\n\u2202H\n\u2202yi\ny\u02d9i = \u2212 \u2202H\u2202xi\n(1.33)\nwith the Hamiltonian\nH(x1, ..., xn; y0, ..., yn;u(t), t) =\nn\u2211\ni=0\nyifi(x1, ..., xn;u(t), t). (1.34)\nAn optimal control function u(t) maximizes H at each instant. H is a continuous\nfunction of the time and one has H(t1) = 0. If the functions fi, i = 0, ..., n do not\ndepend on time explicitly, then H is a constant and equal to zero.\nIt can be seen that the solution of the problem of the energy-optimal guiding\nof the system from a chaotic attractor to another coexisting attractor requires the\nCHAOTIC ESCAPE AND THE PROBLEM OF OPTIMAL CONTROL xxxi\nsolution of the boundary value problem (1.33), (1.34) for the Hamiltonian dynamics.\nThe difficulty in solving these problems stems from the complexity of the system\ndynamics near a CA and is related, in particular, to the delicate problems of the\nuniqueness of the solution, its behaviour near a CA, and the boundary conditions at\na CA.\nBelow we show how the energy-optimal control of chaos can be solved via a\nstatistical analysis of fluctuational trajectories of a chaotic system in the presence\nof small random perturbations. This approach is based on an analogy between the\nvariational formulations of both problems (see e.g. [164]): the problem of the energy-\noptimal control of chaos and the problem of stability of a weakly randomly perturbed\nchaotic attractor. One of the key points of the approach is the identification of the\noptimal control function as an optimal fluctuational force [164].\nWe emphasize that the question of stability of a CA under small random per-\nturbations is in itself an important unsolved problem in the theory of fluctua-\ntions [92, 93, 94] and the difficulties in solving it are similar to those mentioned\nabove. Thus it is unclear at first glance how an analogy between these two unsolved\nproblems could be of any help. However, as already noted above, the new method\nfor statistical analysis of fluctuational trajectories [60, 62, 95, 112] based on the\nprehistory probability distribution allows direct experimental insight into the almost\ndeterministic dynamics of fluctuations in the limit of small noise intensity. Using\nthis techique, it turns out to be possible to verify experimentally the existence of a\nunique solution, to identify the boundary condition on a CA, and to find an accurate\napproximation of the optimal control function.\nLet us now formulate the problem of the energy-optimal steering of the motion\nfrom a chaotic attractor to the coexisting stable limit cycle for a simple model,\na non-centrosymmetric Duffing oscillator. This is the model that, in the absence\nof fluctuations, has traditionally been considered in connection with a variety of\nproblems in nonlinear optics [165]. Consider the motion of a periodically driven\nnonlinear oscillator under control\nq\u02d91 = K1(q(t)) = q2, (1.35)\nq\u02d92 = K2(q(t)) + u(t)\n= \u22122\u0393q2 \u2212 \u03c920q1 \u2212 \u03b2q21 \u2212 \u03b3q31 + h sin(\u03c9t) + u(t),\nHere u(t) is the control function. It is a system where chaos can be observed\nat relatively small values h \u2248 0.1 of the driving force amplitude and the chaotic\nattractor is a non-hyperbolic attractor or a quasiattractor [166].\nWe have considered the following energy-optimal control problem. The system\n(1.35) with unconstrained control function u(t) is to be steered from a CA to a\ncoexisting stable limit cycle (SC) in such a way that the \u201ccost\u201d functional J is\nminimized, with t1 unspecified\nR = inf\nu\u2208U\n1\n2\n\u222b t1\nt0\nu2(t)dt. (1.36)\nxxxii FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\nHere the control set U consists of functions (control signals) able to move the system\nfrom the CA to the SC. The Pontryagin Hamiltonian (1.34) and the corresponding\nequations of motion take the form\nq\u02d9i =\n\u2202Hc\n\u2202pi\n, p\u02d9i = \u2212\u2202Hc\n\u2202qi\n, i = {1, 2}, (1.37)\nHc = 1\/2p\n2\n2 + p1K1 + p2K2.\nHere it is assumed that the optimal control function u(t) at each instant takes those\nvalues u(t) = p2 that maximize Hc over U .\nWe note that for p1 = 0 and p2 = 0 the dynamics of (1.37) reduces to the deter-\nministic dynamics of the original system (1.35) in the absence of control (u(t) = 0).\nSo we begin our analysis by considering some relevant properties of the deterministic\ndynamics of a periodically driven nonlinear oscillator.\nThe parameters of the system (1.35) were chosen such that the potential is monos-\ntable (\u03b22 < 4\u03b3\u03c920), the dependence of the energy of oscillations on their frequency\nis nonmonotonic ( \u03b22\n\u03b3\u03c920\n> 910 ), and the motion is underdamped \u0393\u226a \u03c9 \u2248 2\u03c90.\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n \u03c9\n h\n   P  \nFig. 1.13 Phase diagram of the system (1.35) on the (\u03c9, h) plane obtained numerically for\nthe parameter values \u0393 = 0.025, \u03c90 = 0.597, \u03b2 = 1, \u03b3 = 1.

Its boundary of attraction \u2202\u2126 is nonfractal and is formed by the unstable\nmanifold of the saddle cycle of period 1 (S1).\nFor a given damping (\u0393 = 0.025) the amplitude and the frequency of the driving\nforce were chosen so that the chaotic attractor coexists with the stable limit cycle\n(SC): h = 0.13, \u03c9f = 0.95 (see Fig. 1.13).\nThe basins of attraction of the coexisting CA (strange attractor) and SC are shown\nin the Fig. 1.14 for the Poincare\u00b4 cross-section \u03c9f t = 0.6pi(mod2pi) in the absence\nof noise [168]. The value of the maximal Lyapunov exponent for the CA is 0.0449.\nThe presence of the control function effectively doubles the dimension of the phase\nspace (compare (1.35) and (1.37)) and changes its geometry near the non-hyperbolic\nattractor. In the extended phase space the attractor is connected to the basin of\nattraction of the stable limit cycle via an unstable invariant manifold. It is precisely\nthe complexity of the structure of the phase space of an auxiliary Hamiltonian system\n(1.37) near the non-hyperbolic attractor that makes it difficult to solve the energy-\noptimal control problem.\nxxxiv FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\nHowever, using the recently proposed [60, 62, 95, 112] method for experimental\nanalysis of the Hamiltonian flow in an extended phase space of the fluctuating system,\nwe can exploit an analogy between the Wentzel-Freidlin and Pontryagin Hamiltonians\narising in the analysis of fluctuations, and the energy-optimal control problem in a\nnonlinear oscillator. To see how it can be done let us consider the fluctuational\ndynamics of a nonlinear oscillator (1.35).\nLet us analyze the motion of an oscillator interacting with a thermal bath:\nq\u02d91 = q2,\nq\u02d92 = \u22122\u0393q2 \u2212 \u03c920q1 \u2212 \u03b2q21 \u2212 \u03b3q31 + h sin(\u03c9t) + \u03be(t), (1.38)\n\u3008\u03be(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008\u03be(t)\u03be(0)\u3009 = D\u03b4(t) = 4\u0393kT \u03b4(t).\nIn the zero-noise-intensity limit, a consistent theoretical development [42, 169] from\nthe microscopic to the macroscopic equations of motion leads to descriptions of both\nits deterministic (dissipative) and fluctuational dynamics within the framework of\nHamiltonian formalism [57]. The comparison of the Hamiltonian approach to large\nfluctuations, described in Sec. 1.3, and the approach to optimal control problem shows\nthat, both on physical grounds and rigorously, the Wentzel-Freidlin Hamiltonian [57]\n(1.37) is equivalent to the Pontryagin Hamiltonian (1.34) [163] and the corresponding\noptimal control function is equivalent to the optimal fluctuational force. The analogy\nbetween the two problems opens up the possibility of a direct experimental insight\ninto the geometry of the phase space of system (1.34) using a statistical analysis of\nthe fluctuational trajectories in this system when a control function u(t) is substituted\nfor the random function \u03be(t). In particular the optimal control signal u\u00af(t) can be\nidentified with the optimal fluctuational force which drives the system from the\nchaotic attractor to the stable limit cycle [164]. We note that both u\u00af(t) and the\noptimal force are related to p2 in (1.37) (see e.g. in [143]).\nWe therefore suggest that the optimal control function u\u00af(t) can be found experi-\nmentally by measurement of the optimal fluctuational force [95, 112].\nThis interrelationship is intuitively clear because, in thermal equilibrium (D =\n4\u0393kBT ), the probability of fluctuations is determined by the minimum work of the\nexternal source needed to produce the given change in the thermodynamic quantities\n\u03c1 \u221d exp(\u2212Rmin\/kBT ) [9]. We emphasize that the analysis presented above draws\nan analogy between two quite distinct and separate problems: the deterministic\nenergy-optimal control problem, and the problem of the stability of the system in the\npresence of small random perturbations. Very similar conclusions can be drawn using\na more general formulation of the stochastic optimal control problem (see e.g. [164]).\n1.5.1.2 Statistical analysis of fluctuational trajectories A statistical analysis of\nthe fluctuational trajectories is based on the measurements of the prehistory proba-\nbility distribution [60] ph(q, t; qf , tf ) (see Sec. 1.3). By investigating the prehistory\nprobability distribution experimentally, one can establish the area of phase space\nwithin which optimal paths are well defined, i.e. where the tube of fluctuational\npaths around an optimal path is narrow. The prehistory distribution thus provides\ninformation about both the optimal path and the probability that it will be followed.\nCHAOTIC ESCAPE AND THE PROBLEM OF OPTIMAL CONTROL xxxv\nIn practice the method essentially reduces to continuously following the dynamics\nof the system and constructing the distribution of all realizations of the fluctuational\ntrajectories that transfer it from a state of equilibrium to a prescribed remote state.\nTo find the optimal control function u\u00af(t)we performed digital simulations of (1.38)\nusing the Heun algorithm, with particular care given to the random number generator\n(see [142, 170]), because simulation times necessarily grow exponentially asD \u2192 0.\nWe have also carried out a complementary analog electronic modeling [112] of (1.38).\nWe drive it with zero-mean quasi-white Gaussian noises from a noise generator,\ndigitize the response q1(t), q2(t), \u03be(t), and analyze it with a digital data processor.\nIn both analog and digital simulations, trajectories moving the system from the chaotic\nattractor to the stable limit cycle were collected, and the corresponding distributions\nof the escape trajectories were built and analyzed. Qualitatively similar results were\nobtained but, because precision is of particular importance here, most of the data\nreported below are those from the digital simulations.\nFor the technique to be applicable, a solution of (1.37) moving the system from\nthe CA to \u2202\u2126 must exist, and one has to be able to identify the boundary conditions\nfor this solution on the CA.\nIn the presence of weak noise there is a finite probability of noise-induced tran-\nsitions between the chaotic attractor and a stable limit cycle. In Fig. 1.14 the filled\ncircles show the intersections of one of the real escape trajectories with the given\nPoincare\u00b4 section. The following intuitive escape scenario can be expected in the\nHamiltonian formalism. Let us consider first the escape of the system from the\nbasin of attraction of a stable limit cycle that is bounded by an saddle cycle. In\ngeneral, escape occurs along a single optimal trajectory qopt(t) connecting the two\nlimit cycles.\nThe trajectory qopt(t) is determined by minimizing S in (1.20) on the set of all\nclassical deterministic trajectories determined by the HamiltonianH (1.37), that start\non a stable limit cycle as t\u2192 \u2212\u221e and terminate at an saddle cycle as t\u2192\u221e. That is,\nqopt(t) is a heteroclinic trajectory of the system (1.37) with minimum action, where\nthe minimum is understood in the sense indicated, and the escape probability assumes\nthe form P \u2248 exp(\u2212S\/D). We note that the existence of optimal escape trajectories\nand the validity of the Hamiltonian formalism have been confirmed experimentally\nfor a number of nonchaotic systems (see Refs. [62, 95, 112, 131, 171] and references\ntherein).\nIf the noise is weak, then the probability P \u2248 exp(\u2212S\/D) to escape along the\noptimal trajectory is exponentially small,but it is exponentially greater than the escape\nprobability along any other trajectory, including along other heteroclinic trajectories\nof the system (1.37).\nSince the basin of attraction of the CA is bounded by an saddle cycle S1, the\nsituation near S1 remains qualitatively the same and the escape trajectory remains\nunique in this region. However, the situation is different near the chaotic attractor.\nIn this region it is virtually impossible to analyze the Hamiltonian flux of the addi-\ntional system (1.37), and no predictions have been made about the character of the\ndistribution of the optimal trajectories near the CA. The simplest scenario is that an\nxxxvi FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\noptimal trajectory approaching the boundary of a chaotic attractor is smeared into a\n\u201ccometary tail\" and is lost, merging with the boundary of the attractor.\n0246\n\u22122\n0\n2\n\u22122\n0\n2\n N\n q1\n q2\n  \nFig. 1.15 Escape trajectories found [172] in the analogue simulations for the parameters\nh = 0.19, \u03c9f \u2248 1.045, \u03c90 \u2248 0.597, D \u2248 0.0005 are shown in comparison with the\nPoincare\u00b4 cross-section of a quasi-attractor and its basins of attraction for \u03c9f t = 0.\nHowever, statistical analysis of real fluctuation-induced escape trajectories gives\na more detailed picture of the noise-induced escape from a chaotic attractor. Several\nthousand real escape trajectories of the system (1.38) from the basin of attraction\nof a CA in various operating regimes were investigated [172]. The typical situation\nas measured in analog simulations is displayed in Fig. 1.15 for system parameters\nclose to the point P in Fig. 1.13 and a noise intensity D \u2248 0.0005. The figure\nshows 65 measured fluctuational escape trajectories. All the trajectories have been\nshifted in time so that the characteristic regions of the trajectories corresponding to\nthe transition from chaotic to regular motion coincide with each other.\nIt is evident that all real trajectories pass through the close neighborhood of some\noptimal trajectory in a tube with a radius\u221d \u221aD. Therefore it is possible to determine\nthe optimal escape paths by simple averaging performed separately for each group of\ntrajectories. The number of different optimal escape paths obtained for the transition\nCA \u2192 S3 depends on the choice of the working point. From one to three distinct\noptimal escape paths for operation in various regimes were observed experimentally.\nThe escape probabilities along different paths are different, and, as the noise intensity\nis reduced, one of the escape paths becomes exponentially more probable then the\nothers. In what follows we concentrate on the properties of this most probable escape\npath.\nTo find the boundary conditions on the CA, we analyze the prehistory probability\ndistribution ph(q, t; qf , tf ) of the escape trajectories. The corresponding distribution\nCHAOTIC ESCAPE AND THE PROBLEM OF OPTIMAL CONTROL xxxvii\nis shown in the Fig. 1.16. It can be inferred by the inspection of how the ridge of the\nmost probable escape path merges the CA that most of the escape trajectories pass\nclose to the saddle cycle of the period 5 embedded into the CA.\nThis hypothesis can be elaborated further using a statistical analysis of the trajec-\ntories arriving to a small tube around S3 for the nose intensity reduced by a few orders\nof magnitude up to D = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22126, see Fig. 1.17 [172].

The circles, squares and triangles show single periods of the saddle cycles of\nperiod 5 (S5), 3 (S3), and 1 (S1), respectively [172].\nof the escape trajectories described in the subsection reveals that the energetically\nfavorable way to move the system from the CA to the stable limit cycle starts at the\nsaddle cycle of period 5 (S5) embedded in the CA, passes through saddle cycle S3\nand finishes at the saddle cycle S1 at the boundary of the basin of attraction of the\nCA. Subsequent motion of the system towards the stable limit cycle does not require\nexternal action.\nTo find an approximation to the optimal control function we collect all successful\nrealisations (qesc1 (t), qesc2 (t), \u03beesc(t)) that move it from S5 to \u2202\u2126. An approximate\nsolution u\u02dc(t) is then found as an ensemble average over the corresponding realisations\nof the random force \u3008\u03beesc(t)\u3009 (the exact solution is u\u00af(t) = limD\u21920 u\u02dc(t)). The results\nof this procedure are shown in the upper trace of Fig. 1.18. To remove the irrelevant\nhigh-frequency component left after averaging, we filtered through a zero-phase\nlow-pass filter with frequency cut-off \u03c9c = 1.9.\nIt can be seen from the figure that the optimal force switches on at the moment\nwhen the system leaves S5 along its unstable manifold.

Moreover the problem of\nescape from the CA of a periodically driven nonlinear oscillator can be essentially\nreduced to the analysis of a transition between three saddle cycles S5 \u2192 S3 \u2192 S1.\nWe note that the latter result is in qualitative agreement with the well known state-\nment that unstable cycles provide detailed invariant characterizations for dynamical\nsystems of low intrinsic dimension (see e.g. [173, 174, 175]).\nThis result opens up the possibility of the numerical solution of the corresponding\nboundary value problem for the energy-optimal control formulated above.\nIt can be shown [172] that the average time for the system to approach S5 is\nmuch smaller then the average escape time and thus the optimal escape paths found\nfrom the statistical analysis of the escape trajectories is independent on the initial\nconditions on the attractor and provides an approximation to the global minimum of\nthe corresponding deterministic control problem.\n1.5.1.3 Numerical solution of the boundary value problem In principle, it is\npossible to find the optimal path by direct solution of the Pontryagin Hamiltonian\n(1.37), with appropriate boundary conditions. We must stress that even for this\nrelatively simple system, the solution is a formidable, and almost impossible, task.\nFirst of all, in general one has no insight into the appropriate boundary conditions,\nin particular into those at the starting time (which belong to the strange attractor).\nBut even if the boundaries were known, in practice the determination of the optimal\npath is impossible: the functional R of Eq. (1.36) has so many local minima, that it\nproved impractical to attempt a (general) search for the optimal path.\nCHAOTIC ESCAPE AND THE PROBLEM OF OPTIMAL CONTROL xxxix\n0 5 10 15\n\u22121\n0\n1\n2\n3\n \u03c9ft\/2pi\n \u2329 q1\nesc\u232a\n \u2329 \u03beesc\u232a\n 0\n \u22120.05\nFig. 1.18 The most probable escape path (bottom solid curve) from S5 to the S1, found in\nthe numerical simulations.

Top:\noptimal force (solid line) corresponding to the optimal path after filtration[168], and optimal\nforce from numerical solution of the boundary value problem (dots).\nHowever, once the fluctuational trajectories were available, we did indeed manage\nto find the optimal path using by direct solution of the Pontryagin Hamiltonian. The\nidea is to study the escape scenario which emerges from the fluctuational trajectories:\nas we mentioned, the escape takes place through S3, S5 and S1. We then built\nan initial trial function, taking a linear combination of the structures involved in the\nescape. The combination was such that at short times the trial function coincided with\nS5, while at large times it coincided with S1. At intermediate times, we had a mixture\nof S5 and S1 in the initial trial function, but no S3. Using a well known algorithm\nfor two points boundary conditions (TWPBVP, obtained via netlib [176], see [177]\nfor details), we then relaxed this trial function to find the optimal path, defined as the\npath which minimises the functional 1.36. It is striking that the relaxational optimal\npath that we found does go through S3, in good agreement with what was observed\nfor the optimal path obtained via the fluctuational trajectories (for details, see [172]).\n1.5.1.4 The energy-optimal migration control of a chaotic oscillator Here we\nexamine the control of migration in a periodically driven nonlinear oscillator. Our\naim is to demonstrate that application of the approximate solution found from the\nstatistical analysis of fluctuational trajectories optimizes (minimizes) the energy of\nthe control function. We compare the performance of some known adaptive control\nalgorithms to that of the control function found through our analysis.\nTo verify that the optimal force u\u02dc(t) found in the experiment does minimize the\nenergy of the control function steering the system (1.35) from the CA to the S1, we\nset it to arbitrary initial conditions in the basin of attraction of CA and let it evolve\nxl FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\ndeterministically until it passed through the initial part of the unstable manifold of\nS5. At this moment the deterministic control function was switched on. For small\nvariations in the shape of the control function and\/or initial conditions, the amplitude\nof the control function was set to the threshold of the switching for the system from\nchaotic motion to regular motion on the stable limit cycle. It was found that the\n1 5 9\n \u03c9ft\/2pi\n(a) 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n:2\n:5\nco\nn\ntr\nol\n fu\nnc\ntio\nn \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\n Control\n \nEn\ner\ngy\n(b)\nFig. 1.19 (a) The shapes of the control functions (not drawn to scale) used in the numerical\nexperiment: 1 - optimal force found from the statistical analysis of the fluctuational escape\ntrajectories; 2 - approximation of the optimal force by the u(t) = a1 sin(a2t) exp(\u2212(t \u2212\na3)\n2a4) where ai are constants; 3 - approximation of the optimal force by the rectangular\npulses; 4 - arbitrary perturbation of the optimal force with a low-frequency perturbation;\n5 - control functions produced by the OPCL algorithm; 6 - control function for the adaptive\ncontrol.

It was also demonstrated that any deviation from the shape of u\u02dc(t)\nor from the initial conditions found in the experiment leads to a substantial increase\nin the energy of the control function required to steer system from a CA to S1. Some\nexperimental results are shown in Fig. 1.19. Thus it can be seen that the energy of the\ncontrol function is approximately twice larger if the optimal force is approximated by\nthe sin function modulated by the Gaussian u(t) = a1 sin(a2t) exp(\u2212(t \u2212 a3)2a4)\nand it is \u223c 4 and 20 times larger if the optimal force is approximated by rectangular\npulses or perturbed with arbitrary low-frequency perturbations respectivelly.\nWe have also performed experiments using an open-plus-closed-loop control tech-\nnique [155] and adaptive control algorithm [156] to steer the system from the CA to\nthe S1. The equations of motion are taken in the form\nq\u02d91 = q2 + F1(q, g, t),\nq\u02d92 = \u22122\u0393q2 \u2212 \u03c920q1 \u2212 \u03b2q21 \u2212 \u03b3q31 \u2212 f cos(\u03c9t)\n+F2(q, g, t), q = q1, q2, g = g1, g2\n(1.39)\nCHAOTIC ESCAPE AND THE PROBLEM OF OPTIMAL CONTROL xli\nHere F (q, g, t) is the control function in the form\nF (q, g, t) = (g\u02d9 \u2212K(g)) + S(t)(K \u2032(g)\u2212A)(g(t)\u2212 q(t)). (1.40)\nWe will be interested in the situation when the \u201cgoal dynamics\u201d g(t) is a solution of\n(1.35) with u(t) = 0, i.e. g\u02d9 = K(g). Namely g(t) describes the stable limit cycle\nof period 1 SC coexisting with the CA. Thus the first term in (1.40) vanishes. And\nF (q, g, t) takes the following explicit form\nFi(q, g, t) = S(t)\n\u2211\nj=1,2\n(Kij \u2212 aij)(gj \u2212 qj), (1.41)\nHere i = 1, 2 and Kij = \u2202Ki\/\u2202qj . We have considered only the case aij =\n\u2212|aij|\u03b4ij and S(t) = 1\u2212 exp(\u2212\u03bbt) as it was suggested in [156]. Parameters |a| and\n\u03bb were varied to optimize the energy of the control function.\nThe energy of the control functions obtained by these methods varies from 0.14\nto 0.6 and thus it is more then one order of magnitude larger then the energy of the\noptimal control function u\u02dc(t) found by our new technique. (see Fig. 1.19). Similar\nresults were obtained using the algorithm for adaptive chaos control [150] for the\nmigration of the nonlinear oscillator from the CA to SC (see Fig. 1.19).\nWe note that neither the OPCL nor the adaptive control algorithms were devised\nto optimize the energy of the control, but rather the recovery time. It is clear that\nthese methods are insensitive to the initial conditions at the CA. The shapes of the\ncontrol functions are, to a large extent, also prescribed by the algorithms and are not\noptimized. In this sense the high energy of the control functions is not a surprise: the\nresults presented serve the purpose to illustrate the main point, i.e. the sensitivity of\nthe optimal control to the shape of the control function and to the initial conditions,\ndiscussed above.\n1.5.2 Fluctuational escape from a quasi-hyperbolic attractor\nWe now consider, for comparison, fluctuational escape from the Lorenz attractor,\nwhich, for a certain range of parameters, is a quasi-hyperbolic attractor consisting of\nunstable sets only [160]:\nq\u02d91 = \u03c3(q2 \u2212 q1),\nq\u02d92 = rq1 \u2212 q2 \u2212 q1q3, (1.42)\nq\u02d93 = q1q2 \u2212 bq3 + \u03be(t),\n\u3008\u03be(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008\u03be(t)\u03be(0)\u3009 = D\u03b4(t) (1.43)\nIn the absence of noise, the system [178] describes the generation of a single-mode\nlaser field interacting with a homogeneously broadened two-level medium [179].\nThe variables and parameters of the Lorenz system can be interpreted in terms of\na laser system as: q1 is the normalized electric field amplitude, q2 the normalized\npolarization, q3 the normalized inversion, \u03c3 = k\/\u03b31, r = \u039b + 1, b = \u03b32\/\u03b31, with\nxlii FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\nk the cavity decay rate of the field in the cavity, \u03b31 and \u03b32 the relaxation constants\nof the inversion and polarization, and \u039b the pump parameter. Far-infrared lasers\nhave been proposed as an example of a realization of the Lorenz system [161]. A\ndetailed comparison of the dynamics of the system (1.42) and a far-infrared laser,\nplus a discussing the validity of the Lorenz system as laser model, can be found in\n[162].\nThe Lorenz equations have a simple structure and contain two nonlinear terms\nonly. Let us briefly consider the main bifurcations in the system (1.42) (a more\ndetailed analysis can be found in [180]). We fix the parameters \u03c3 = 10, b = 8\/3\nand vary the parameter r: in this case two global bifurcations take place (see the\nbifurcation diagram in Fig. 1.20). For r = 1, a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation\nhappens: the stationary state at the origin O \u2261 (0, 0, 0) becomes a saddle state\nand two new stationary states appear: P1 \u2261 (\n\u221a\nb(r \u2212 1),\n\u221a\nb(r \u2212 1), r \u2212 1) and\nP2 \u2261 (\u2212\n\u221a\nb(r \u2212 1),\u2212\n\u221a\nb(r \u2212 1), r \u2212 1). In the system phase space there are two\nstable points P1 and P2, a saddle point O at the origin, and their one-dimensional\n(separatrixes) and two-dimensional manifolds.\nThe second bifurcation occurs at\nr =\n\u03c3(\u03c3 + b+ 3)\n(\u03c3 \u2212 b\u2212 1) \u2248 24.74..., (1.44)\nand it is a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, when states P1 and P2 loss their stability and\nin the phase space there is the unique chaotic quasi-hyperbolic attractor.\nThere are also two local bifurcations. The first one takes place for r \u2248 13.926...,\nwhen a homoclinic tangency of separatrixes of the origin O occurs (it is not shown\nin Fig. 1.20) and a hyperbolic set appears, which consists of a infinite number of\nsaddle cycles. Beside the hyperbolic set, there are two saddle cycles L1 and L2\naround the stable states P1 and P2. The separatrixes of the origin O withdraw to\nthe saddle cycles L1 and L2, and the attractors of system are the states P1 and P2.\nThe second local bifurcation is observed for r \u2248 24.06. The separatrixes do not\nwithdraw to the saddle cycles L1 and L2. As a result, in the phase space of the\nsystem a stable quasi-hyperbolic state appears \u2014 the Lorenz attractor. The chaotic\nLorenz attractor includes separatrices, the saddle pointO and a hyperbolic set, which\nappears as a result of homoclinic tangency of separatrices. The presence of the saddle\npoint in the chaotic attractor defines the prefix \u201cquasi\u201d in the definition of the chaotic\nattractor as quasi-hyperbolic [160]. The states P1, P2 remain stable. Thus, in the\nrange r \u2208 [24.06 : 24.74] the co-existence of the chaotic attractor and two stable\npoint-attractors is observed in the phase space of the Lorenz system. Let us fix the\nparameter r = 24.08 in this range and consider the noise-induced escape for the\nchaotic attractor to the basins of attraction of the stable points. Note that in [64]\nthe invariant measure of the noisy Lorenz attractor was found within a Hamiltonian\nformalism, but large deviations from a chaotic attractor were not considered.\nFirst, we examine [181] the structure of the system phase space for chosen param-\neters \u03c3 = 10, b = 8\/3, r = 24.08 (Fig. 1.21).\nCHAOTIC ESCAPE AND THE PROBLEM OF OPTIMAL CONTROL xliii\nFig. 1.20 The bifurcation diagram of the lorenz system for fixed \u03c3 = 10, b = 8\/3. The\nunstable and stable sets are shown by dashed and solid lines respectively.\nThe saddle cycles L1 and L2 surround the stable states P1 and P2 and they are\nlocated at the intersection of the unstableWu and stableW s manifolds. The unstable\nmanifold goes to the stable state P1 from one side and to the chaotic attractor from\nthe other side. The stable manifoldW s forms a tube in the vicinity of the stable state\n[182]. The saddle cycles L1 and L2 have the multipliers (1.0000, 1.0280, 0.0001),\nand therefore trajectories will go slowly away along the unstable manifold and they\nwill approach quickly along the stable manifold.\nFor simplicity we add noise in the form of a white noise \u03be(t) to the third equation\nof system (1.42), preserving the original system symmetry.\nLike the escape from a non-hyperbolic attractor, there is no theoretical prediction\nabout the process of fluctuational escape from the Lorenz attractor. But the process is\nreadily studied via numerical simulation and via analysis of the prehistory probabil-\nity distribution built using the fluctuational escape trajectories. For definiteness, we\nexamine escape to the stable point P1. The averaged escape trajectory and the cor-\nresponding averaged fluctuational force obtained in this way are shown in Fig. 1.22.\nWe have found that the escape occurs via the following scenario. The escape tra-\njectory starts from the stable manifold of the saddle point O. Under the action of a\nfluctuation, an escape trajectory tends to point O along the two-dimensional stable\nmanifold. Then, without reaching the saddle point O, the trajectory departs from it\nagain, following a path close to the separatrix \u03932, and falling into the neighborhood\nof the saddle cycle L1. In the absence of an external force, the trajectory goes away\nfrom the cycle L1, slowly untwisting. The fluctuational force induces a crossing\nthrough the saddle cycle, and the trajectory then relaxes to the stable point P1. We\ncan thus split the escape process into two parts: fluctuational and relaxational. In\npractice all the fluctuational part belongs to the Lorenz attractor, and itself consists of\nxliv FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\n\u221225\n\u221220\n\u221215\n\u221210\n\u22125 0 5 10 15 20 25\n\u221220\u221210\n0 100\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n q\n2\n\u03931\nL1\nP1\n O\nL2\n q1\nP2\n\u03932\n q3\nFig. 1.21 Structure of the phase space of the Lorenz system.

During the second stage, the fluctuations have a component which\nCONCLUSIONS xlv\noscillates in anti-phase to the coordinate q3. Because the trajectory of the noise-free\nsystem departs from the cycle L1 very slowly, the fluctuational force inducing the\ncrossing through the cycle may start to act at any time during a long interval. For this\nreason the averaged fluctuational force itself consists of a long oscillating function.\nIt is clear that all of the escape trajectory from the Lorenz attractor lies on the\nattractor itself. The role of the fluctuations is, first, to bring the trajectory to a seldom-\nvisited area in the neighborhood of the saddle cycle L1, and then to induce a crossing\nof the cycle L1. So we may conclude that the role of the fluctuations is different in\nthis case, and the possibility of applying the Hamiltonian formalism will require a\nmore detailed analysis of the crossing process.\nThus, we have found that the mechanisms of escape from a non-hyperbolic at-\ntractor and a quasi-hyperbolic (Lorenz) attractor are quite different, and that the\nprehistory of the escape trajectories reflects the different structure of their chaotic\nattractors. The escape process for the non-hyperbolic attractor is realized via several\nsteps, which include transitions between low-period saddle-cycles co-existing in the\nsystem phase space. The escape from the Lorenz attractor consist of two qualitatively\ndifferent stages: the first is defined by the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle\ncenter point, and lies on the attractor; the second is the escape itself, crossing the\nsaddle boundary cycle surrounding the stable point attractor. Finally, we should like\nto point out that our main results were obtained via an experimental definition of\noptimal paths, confirming our experimental approach as a powerful instrument for\ninvestigating noise-induced escape from complex attractors.\n1.6 CONCLUSIONS\nThe recent rapid advances in the understanding of fluctuating nonlinear systems,\nincluding optical systems, have come about in large part through the mutually sup-\nportive relationship between analytic calculation and analog and digital simulations.\nThis has been especially true of problems involving large fluctuations, where use of\nsimulations, coupled with the introduction of the prehistory probability distribution,\nhave set the area on an experimental basis for the first time, and helped to stimulate\nnew advances in the theory. These have included the logarithmic susceptibility, de-\nscribed above, which promises to do for optimal paths what the conventional linear\nsusceptibility has done for linear response theory. The theory of the logarithmic\nsusceptibility in turn has been tested, and its limits of applicability explored, through\nsimulations. And the same is true of recent developments in understanding Kramers\u2019\nproblem on short timescales. Studies of the fluctuational escape from chaotic at-\ntractors, of which two examples is described above, are entirely simulation-led at\npresent. But the results of the analogue and digital experiments have already pro-\nvided strong guidance for future developments in the theory. It seems certain that the\nclose symbiotic relationship between simulation and theory in fluctuational dynamics\nwill continue, and that the emergence of many new results and phenomena may be\nanticipated over the next few years.\nxlvi FLUCTUATIONAL ESCAPE AND RELATED PHENOMENA\nAcknowledgements\nWe warmly acknowledge the assistance and support of our many collaborators in\nthe research reviewed in this chapter including, especially, I.Kh.
