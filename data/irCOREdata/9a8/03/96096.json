It contributes a huge amount to the nation\u2019s wellbeing and health. To \nimprove the experiences of those who use services and support the efforts of people \nworking in social care (with or without pay), a new research initiative has been \nlaunched. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) School for Social Care \nResearch (SSCR) has been funded by the Department of Health through the NIHR, \nbringing together researchers and research groups working in social care in England. \nIts mission is to develop the evidence base for adult social care practice by \ncommissioning and conducting high-quality research. \n \nBASIC PARAMETERS \n \nThe NIHR SSCR formally began work in May 2009 with a budget of \u00a315m over five \nyears. It is a partnership between six leading centres of social care research in \nEngland: the three branches of the Personal Social Services Research Unit (at the \nLondon School of Economics and Political Science, University of Kent and University \nof Manchester), the Social Policy Research Unit (University of York), the Social Care \nWorkforce Research Unit (King\u2019s College London) and the Tizard Centre (University of \nKent).  \n \nActivities  \n \nThe SSCR will pursue its mission through a number of interlinked \nactivities: \n \n\u2022 conducting high-quality research to produce new knowledge including, where \nappropriate, reviewing and synthesising existing knowledge, in order to \ninform the future development of adult social care practice; \n\u2022 commissioning high-quality research through competitive tendering; \n\u2022 providing a focus for adult social care research within the NIHR, as well as \nstrategic leadership for the development of social care research more \ngenerally; \n\u2022 developing methodological rigour and broadening the methodological \nrepertoire, including bringing into social care research a number of \ndisciplinary perspectives currently not well represented; \n\u2022 consulting widely on research priorities; \n\u2022 contributing to ongoing efforts by others to build social care research capacity \nand improve research awareness; \n\u2022 disseminating findings and supporting other knowledge transfer activities. \n \nThrough these various activities, the School\u2019s work is intended to help to improve the \nquality of care and support services for all those people who use them. \n \nStructure \n \nThe work of the School is coordinated by an Executive Group comprising the Director \n(Martin Knapp) and five Associate Directors (David Challis at Manchester, Caroline \nGlendinning at York, Jill Manthorpe at King\u2019s College London, Jim Mansell and Ann \nNetten at Kent). The School\u2019s Associate Directors were selected following an open \n 3\ncall for statements of eligibility in February 2009. The Executive Group is supported \nby the School\u2019s Senior Scientific Administrator (Gill Hastings) and Finances and \nCommunications Administrator (Anji Mehta). The Executive Group is responsible for \nthe research questions that are to be examined, the commissioning processes and \ndecisions, monitoring of ongoing studies and assessment of final reports. It also has \nan important role to play in dissemination and knowledge transfer.  \n \nThe Executive Group is advised by an enthusiastic Advisory Board (chaired by David \nBehan, Director General for Social Care, Local Government and Care Partnerships in \nthe Department of Health) and supported by a recently established Reference Group \nof people who use services, carers and practitioners.  \n \nAs well as the Associate Directors, the other researchers associated with the School \nare of two kinds: \n \n\u2022 principal investigators (PIs) of research projects commissioned by the School; \nand \n\u2022 advisers and external experts (funded or otherwise by the School) who \nsupport the School through their experience and expertise. \n \nOver the five-year period, approximately half the research budget will be spent on \nstudies carried out by teams in the Executive Group\u2019s research units, and half on \nstudies carried out by others. \n \nCOMMUNICATIONS \n \nResearch in an area such as social care is not simply the production of findings, of \ncourse, but the formulation of approaches that address real-world issues and the \ncommunication of the findings of completed studies to stakeholders so that there is \nthe potential to influence practice. Social care research has particularly strong \ntraditions of user and practitioner engagement in both areas of activity. The NIHR \nSSCR therefore has an important communications function, both in respect of its \nresearch programme (see Appendix) and also in relation to its various other roles. An \neffective communications strategy \u2014 providing for ongoing two-way dialogue \u2014 is \ncrucial. For example, every team receiving project funding from the School will be \nrequired to produce a brief, accessible, lay summary for wider dissemination on the \nSchool website and through other channels, one or more peer-reviewed paper(s) for \npublication in high-quality academic journals and a short report reflecting on the \nmethods used and any issues\/lessons that arise in their use. All such outputs will be \nsubject to the School\u2019s peer-review process. More generally, there will be an \nelectronic newsletter, an annual conference (the first in spring 2010), descriptive and \nsummary articles in social care, social work and other professional outlets and the \ntrade press, an annual report and regular updates on the School\u2019s website. In other \nwords, considerable efforts will be made to disseminate findings and announcements \nwidely to policy, practice, carer, service user, education and lay audiences. At the \nsame time, there is commitment to ensuring that there are plenty of opportunities \nfor each of these groups and individuals to feed their views into the School\u2019s \nidentification of research questions to be addressed, methods to be used and other \nactivities. To ensure the widest dissemination of its research findings, the School will \nalso work with other knowledge transfer organisations, such as Making Research \nCount, Research into Practice for Adults and the Social Care Institute for Excellence. \nIt is probably fair to say that \u2014 compared, for example, with the health field \u2014 \nrobust research evidence is less plentiful and less well communicated to social care \n 4\nusers, carers, practitioners, managers, provider organisations, commissioners and \npolicy makers (local and national).These groups have also not been as well engaged \nas would be helpful in the processes of generating research ideas, designing and \nundertaking studies. This is one reason why the NIHR set up the School, and why the \nSchool wants to engage the interest and support of all relevant stakeholders. \n \nCOMMISSIONING RESEARCH \n \nThe core aim of the NIHR SSCR is to conduct and commission high-quality (\u2018world \nclass\u2019) research to inform the development of adult social care practice. \n \nConsultation for research ideas \n \nAs part of the commissioning process, the School is consulting with a wide range of \nstakeholders in social care about research topics and questions, the methods needed \nto answer them, the processes through which these methods are to be implemented, \nand how findings can be translated so as to aid the development of practice. The \npurpose of this ongoing consultation is to identify priorities for topics, methods and \nprocesses, not just as the School gets underway but throughout its five-year funding \nperiod.  \n \nA range of processes are underway to help the School identify evidence gaps or \u2018grey \nareas\u2019. These include discussions with the Advisory Board and the User, Carer and \nPractitioner Reference Group (UCPRG); open consultation with researchers, \ncommissioners, providers, people who use services, carers, front-line professionals \nand other key individuals; an online facility for making suggestions; and discussions \nwith social care organizations and groups, such as the Social Care Institute for \nExcellence, Making Research Count, Research in Practice for Adults and the Joint \nUniversity Council Social Work Education Committee. Research reviews to synthesise \nexisting knowledge and identify gaps where further research is needed will also be \nincorporated into the design of some of the School\u2019s research projects.  \n \nIn July 2009, a call was made for outline research proposals, with the emphasis on \noriginality, relevance and potential improvements for adult social care practice in \nEngland. There will be further such calls on a regular basis. The authors would be \ndelighted to hear from readers of the Journal of Care Services Management about \nareas where experience has shown that there is a need for better evidence so that \npractice can be developed and people\u2019s lives improved. \n \nWithin the School, the desire is to build as clear an understanding as possible of \nwhat people working in care services want to know so as to inform what they do. \nWhile there is likely to be no shortage of ideas of what research might be done, it is \nimportant to ensure that questions are addressed that relate to the reality of social \ncare as delivered and experienced. There will be many opportunities to contribute to \nthis consultation but readers are welcome to contact the NIHR School at any time to \nstart conversations. \n \nCommissioning \n \nThe School aims to commission research of the highest quality. It must be ethical \nand it will be independently peer-reviewed and widely disseminated. Each of the \nstudies will need to engage as fully as possible with people who use services and \n 5\nother stakeholders. All projects commissioned by the NIHR SSCR will have their \ndetails lodged on the central Research Register for Social Care.  \n \nThe Executive Group takes decisions on what projects to commission and whether \nresearch should be commissioned from the group itself or externally, after taking \nadvice. Among the factors to be taken into consideration will be the current state of \nevidence in the field, the type of research to be undertaken, the most appropriate \ndesign for that type of research, the expected value for money of the work and, most \nimportantly, its relevance to the improvement of social care practice in England. To \nreiterate an earlier point, half of the overall budget will be allocated \u2018externally\u2019 (ie to \ngroups other than those headed by Executive Group members). This will be through \nopen competitive tendering. Every research project \u2014 whether external or internal \u2014 \nwill be peer-reviewed by at least one researcher who is independent of the School \nand at least one service user or carer. \n \nOpportunities to apply for research funding are being advertised widely. Proposals \nwill be required to specify the research questions, the design or approach to be \nfollowed (where relevant), the expected length of the study and an indicative cost. \nDecisions on the proposals to be funded will be informed by criteria such as: \n \n\u2022 feasibility, excellence and originality; \n\u2022 relevance to social care practice in England; \n\u2022 potential to have an impact on practice and on the lives of people using \nservices and their carers; \n\u2022 value for money; \n\u2022 strength of the research team; \n\u2022 ethical considerations; and \n\u2022 contribution to the coherence of the programme and to the work of NIHR \nSSCR more broadly. \n \nThe quality of the research commissioned will be monitored. \n \nDisciplines and principles \n \nIf the work of the new School is to be of the highest standard and relevant it will \nneed to draw on a wide range of academic disciplines and employ a range of \nresearch methods. It will be important to strike a balance between what is \nsometimes called \u2018world-class science\u2019 (ie of a standard that warrants publication in \nthe best academic journals in the field) and research that will have an impact on \nsocial care as experienced and delivered everyday. Of course, there is not \nnecessarily always a tension between the two. The findings from research will need \nto be translated into outputs that are accessible and usable by all relevant \nstakeholders within social care and related systems.  \n \nCertain core principles will consistently guide the School\u2019s research activities, and a \nnumber of themes are likely to be common to most research studies:  \n \n\u2022 user, carer and practitioner engagement will be emphasized throughout the \nSchool\u2019s activities; \n\u2022 the highest ethical and research governance standards will be essential; \n\u2022 the pursuit of scientific excellence is imperative, but must be proportionate to \nthe real-world relevance of the question and the likely impact of the findings; \n 6\n\u2022 research commissioned and conducted by the School should have real-world \nimpact; \n\u2022 peer-review processes are being employed to ensure that funded proposals \nare of a high standard and are relevant; \n\u2022 completed reports will be similarly assessed; \n\u2022 the details of commissioned projects and the findings of completed studies \nwill be highly visible within the public domain, and accessible to all relevant \nstakeholders. \n \nAmong the themes that will run through much of the work of the School will be: \n \n\u2022 the use of robust outcome measures, not just for the people who use services \nbut also for their carers and relevant others; \n\u2022 attention also to \u2018process outcomes\u2019, reflecting how individuals access and \nexperience care and support; \n\u2022 examination of cost-effectiveness, ensuring that resource impacts are \naddressed alongside outcome impacts and that any trade-offs are \ntransparent; \n\u2022 recognition of cultural, ethnic and socioeconomic diversity; \n\u2022 exploration of the interfaces between social care, healthcare and relevant \nother systems (such as housing, pensions and benefits); \n\u2022 identification of the consequences of practice changes for the paid workforce \nin the statutory, third and private sectors, and for unpaid carers. \n \nPROJECTS IN THE FIRST WAVE \n \nThe first \u2018wave\u2019 of work funded by the School is a small set of projects led by \nmembers of the Executive Group. (As noted earlier, the \u2018second wave\u2019 of projects will \nbe carried out by other research groups.) Formal proposals were drawn up for each \nof those early projects, sent out for external peer review, and amended in the light \nof comments received. Four such projects have been started in 2009. The brief \ndescriptions that follow can be supplemented with fuller details from the NIHR SSCR \nwebsite. \n \nIndividualisation of services \u2014 A scoping study \n \nIn Putting People First, the Department of Health2 set out a vision of a transformed \napproach to adult social care. A key approach in this process is personalisation, \nparticularly through the use of personal budgets. For the ambitious policy outcomes \nto be achieved, it is important that there is a wide range of options available in \norder to meet individuals\u2019 needs and to help them achieve their personal outcomes in \nways that suit them best. Ann Netten, Director of the PSSRU at the University of \nKent, is leading a preliminary scoping study that will identify approaches and \ninterventions that merit evaluation. It will provide a platform for formulating \nresearch questions and designing studies that will help to build the evidence base for \nwhat works in \u2018personalised\u2019 care, thereby helping councils and providers in \ncommissioning, developing and refining effective and cost-effective care and support \narrangements. The scoping study will also identify those services likely to face \nreductions in demand, with consequent challenges, not only for providers, but for \nboth commissioners and services users. The overall aim of what is expected to \nbecome a stream of work is that there will be a steady stream of relevant, robust \nevidence about the challenges that need to be addressed by individuals and their \n 7\ncarers, the variety of personalised means available or developed to address those \nproblems, and the likely effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of each of them. \n \nSocial care practice with carers: An investigation of practice models \n \nThe need to support people providing unpaid care for adults with an illness or \ndisability has become increasingly important in government policy. As a result, \nnumerous social care jobs have been established, some aimed at strategic \ndevelopment, others at coordination of support and some at provision of direct \nassistance for carers. Other than internal unpublished evaluations of these roles and \ndescriptive accounts written in the professional press, little work has been done to \nanalyse the ways in which these staff undertake their work and consider their \neffectiveness. This study will employ a concurrent mixed-methods design to consider \npractice activities and models, and their effectiveness as measured by the staff, \ncommissioners and carers themselves. A target has been set of 84 interviews with \nprofessional staff and carers, a national postal\/online survey of councils (hoping for \ndata from 75 on the basis of a 50 per cent response rate) and analysis of a sample of \n40 care\/ support plans set up after a carer\u2019s assessment. The last of these will be \ncarried out in conjunction with the practitioner and carer to establish the model of \npractice being employed and its effectiveness. Taken together, these methods will \nprovide new information on an under-researched practice area that is likely to be \nincreasingly important in light of the personalisation agenda. This project is led by Jill \nManthorpe, Director of the Social Care Workforce Research Unit, King\u2019s College \nLondon, and the principal investigator is Jo Moriarty, who has worked on influential \nstudies involving carers for many years. \n \nCare and support for people with complex and severe needs: Innovations \nand practice \u2014 A scoping study \n \nPeople with complex and severe needs constitute a relatively small proportion of the \npopulation of all adult social care users; however, this group is growing in number, \nand individuals with these complex and severe needs are actually quite problematic \nfor service commissioners and providers. One reason for this is the high costs of \ntheir support; another is that they often need personalised, coordinated and \nspecialised services from a wide range of providers. Caroline Glendinning, Research \nDirector (Adults, Older People and Carers) at the Social Policy Research Unit, \nUniversity of York, is leading a scoping study that will identify: \n \n\u2022 key features of the service and support arrangements desired by different \ngroups of adults and older people with severe and complex needs; and \n\u2022 evidence of initiatives to deliver support to people with complex and severe \nneeds that have the desired features and the potential to constitute examples \nof \u2018good practice\u2019. Examples may focus on some or all of the different levels of \ncommissioning, operational organisation and front-line delivery. \n \nThe study involves: \n \n\u2022 consultation with key stakeholders, including organisations of and for service \nusers and carers, on the desired features of good support and service \narrangements for people with severe and complex needs; \n\u2022 a review of recent published and grey research on relevant service \ndevelopments and initiatives; and \n 8\n\u2022 a survey of English adult social care departments on patterns of services, new \ndevelopments and potential examples of good practice. \n \nExamples of good practice will be identified that could subsequently be subject to \nrigorous evaluation. \n \nCosts and outcomes of skilled support for adults with complex needs in \nsupported accommodation \n \nThe opportunities presented by more personalised service models need skilled staff \nsupport if they are to be realised by people with complex needs. The aims of this \nproject, led by Jim Mansell, Director of the Tizard Centre at the University of Kent, \nare: \n \n\u2022 to evaluate the impact of skilled staff support on the lives of people with \ncomplex needs; and \n\u2022 to describe the nature of the support required and its implications. \n \nIn this particular study, the focus is on people with severe and profound learning \ndisabilities who have (a) serious challenging behaviour, and\/or (b) additional multiple \ndisabilities, and\/or (c) autism. The aim is to recruit approximately 65 people in each \nof three sub-groups, including people using residential services, people living in \nsupported accommodation and people with self-directed services. \n \nThe study will identify supported accommodation settings for people with severe and \nprofound learning disabilities with one or more of the characteristics ((a) to (c) \nabove), where the settings provide active support, augmentative and alternative \ncommunication, positive behaviour support or the National Autistic Society \u2018SPELL\u2019 \nframework (the \u2018experimental\u2019 group); and broadly comparable services not \nproviding these kinds of support (the \u2018comparison\u2019 group). In each of these settings, \nparticipant characteristics will be measured, as well as quality of life, quality of the \nsupport received, service use patterns and costs. Both observational methods and \nquestionnaires will be used. The support provided in the experimental group will be \ndescribed, along with its implications. The next step will be to select matched \nsamples of residents from the experimental and comparison groups, and then to \ncompare quality of life, quality of support and costs. Multivariate statistical analyses \nwill be carried out to identify and illustrate the relationships between support, quality \nof life and participant characteristics. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nIn announcing the establishment of the new research School, the then Care Services \nMinister said: \u2018We want to improve the evidence for social care practice so we can be \nsure that people in this country are provided with better and more effective services \nin the future. This new National School for Social Care Research will make a major \ncontribution to improving the volume and quality of the research in the English \nsocial care sector.\u20193\n \nProfessor Dame Sally Davies, Director General of Research and Development at the \nDepartment of Health, noted: \n \n\u2018The new NIHR SSCR . . . will give researchers the time and funding to ask the \nimportant questions and improve our understanding of what works, what doesn\u2019t \n 9\nwork and why. This new School will provide considerable benefit to the health and \nwell-being of the population through the new knowledge gained.\u20194  \n \nThe new School is committed to helping to improve the quality of care and support \nservices. This means that it must make sure that the research undertaken really is \nrelevant to people who use services, to unpaid carers, to practitioners, and to other \noperational and strategic decision makers. How researchers intend to communicate \ntheir findings to these and any other relevant stakeholders will be one of the factors \ntaken into account when proposals for research are being assessed. However, social \ncare research in England today is conducted by quite a small group of people, \ncertainly in comparison with the number of health service researchers. In support of \nthe principal aims of the School to conduct and commission world-class research, the \nauthors are also hoping to contribute to the efforts made by others to develop \ngreater capacity \u2014 both in the supply of research and in its utilisation by decision \nmakers throughout the statutory, third and private social care sectors. \n \nIn concluding, the launch of the NIHR School marks an important new opportunity. \nIts focus is on adult social care practice \u2014 an area where, for example, occupational \ntherapists, care assistants and social workers operate with relatively little evidence \nor best practice to guide them. Traditionally, research efforts with families and \nchildren or offenders have commanded greater funding and have been more widely \npromulgated. Messages from research about adult social care are often not \n\u2018translated\u2019 into practitioner material or professional guidelines. One of the \nunderlying reasons for this is that research on adult social care has sometimes \nstemmed from clinical and medical models with their focus on dysfunction, illnesses \nor long-term conditions. There are enormous bodies of literature on specific diseases \nand disorders but little work that broadens this out to address the social care needs \nof people with multiple, complex, fluctuating social problems and their wider lives. \nFor instance, in such an approach, people with dementia are often grouped together \nas if they all have the same characteristics, needs and expectations. Some medical \nor health services research fails to distinguish between people it terms \u2018carers\u2019 and \n\u2018paid carers\u2019 or what it terms \u2018institutional care\u2019 (which can range, of course, from \nnursing homes with over 100 residents to small group homes). Residential care is \nnot just at risk of being seen as homogeneous, but it can be portrayed as a \u2018failure\u2019 \nof community-based support, rather than the positive move or choice that it might \nbe for some people. While these may appear to be stereotypes, they do sometimes \nseem to characterise research that is produced within health service settings and \ndesigned to inform health services policy and practice development. The new NIHR \nSchool, although located within the National Institute of Health Research, will not be \nconstrained in this way. The focus is on adult social care practice, and an important \nplatform for the research to be conducted is the set of theories and methodologies \nthat have been developed in social care contexts.  \n \nThe establishment of the School and its location within the NIHR acknowledge the \nsubstantial contribution that social care practitioners also make to the nation\u2019s \nhealth. The Department of Health\u2019s National Health Research Strategy, Best \nResearch for Best Health5 established a more centralised system for research and \ndevelopment to promote more open and competitive processes for allocation of \nfunding, underpinned by strong governance.  \n \nNot surprisingly, the NIHR has great expectations of the School. There is a need for \ngreater understanding of the issues, for analysis of the realities of practice, and the \nneed to look at processes and outcomes. The School is aspiring to conduct and \n 10\ncommission research that social care professionals and decision makers will be able \nto use with confidence in different practice settings, agencies and team relationships. \nAll funded studies must demonstrate that service users, carers and practitioners view \nthe research questions as relevant. On completion, the findings of these studies will \nalso need to be widely disseminated. The authors hope that readers of the Journal of \nCare Services Management will work with the School to make the most of these \nopportunities. \n \nNote \n \nThis paper presents independent research funded by the Department of Health\u2019s \nNIHR SSCR.

This structure is certainly not set in \nstone and will be re-examined and adjusted over time. (In order to secure the \ncontract with the NIHR, the authors needed to set out a broad programme of \nresearch, but of course this was ahead of the Department of Health\u2019s selection of the \nExecutive Group and ahead of any concerted programme of consultation about \nresearch topics and questions.) Each programme can be described in terms of a \nsummary question: \n \n\u2022 How can we best prevent or reduce the development or exacerbation of \ncircumstances that lead to the need for social care? For short, we are \npresently referring to this as the Prevention and Reduction programme. \n\u2022 How can we best empower and safeguard people who use social care \nservices? This is the Empowerment and Safeguarding programme. \n\u2022 How can we best equip and support people \u2014 practitioners, volunteers and \ninformal carers \u2014 to provide optimum social care? How can we ensure that \npeople who use social care and their carers are enabled and supported in paid \nwork and other types of meaningful activity? This is the Care and Work \nprogramme. \n\u2022 What interventions, commissioning and delivery arrangements best achieve \nsocial care outcomes? This is the Service Interventions, Commissioning and \nChange programme. \n 11\n\u2022 How can social care and other public resources best be deployed and \ncombined to achieve social care outcomes? This is the Resources and \nInterfaces programme. \n \nThe term \u2018social care\u2019 here refers to the full range of care and support arrangements \nmade available or possible for adults with a wide range of needs, characteristics and \ncircumstances. It includes care and support provided by families and communities, \nand whether publicly funded or privately purchased. The term \u2018best\u2019 in each bullet \npoint above will include such criteria as effective, cost-effective and equitable (in \nterms of opportunity\/access and\/or in terms of resources used or outcomes \nachieved).  \n \nVarious types of research will be undertaken: reviews, initial \u2018scoping\u2019 of the issues, \nexploratory studies and full evaluations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12\n"}
