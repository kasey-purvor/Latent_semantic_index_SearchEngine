Although the Survey currently has a patchy angular selection func-\ntion, we use the Virgo Consortium\u2019s Hubble Volume simulation to demonstrate that\nwe are able to make a useful first measurement of the power spectrum over more than\na decade in scale.\nWe compare the redshift-space power spectra of QSOs to those measured for\ngalaxies and Abell clusters at low redshift and find that they show similar shapes in\ntheir overlap range, 50-150h\u22121Mpc, with PQSO(k) \u221d k\n\u22121.4. The amplitude of the QSO\npower spectrum at z \u2248 1.4 is almost comparable to that of galaxies at the present day\nif \u2126m=0.3 and \u2126\u039b=0.7 (the \u039b cosmology), and a factor of \u2248 3 lower if \u2126m=1 (the\nEdS cosmology) is assumed. The amplitude of the QSO power spectrum is a factor of\n\u2248 10 lower than that measured for Abell clusters at the present day. At larger scales,\nthe QSO power spectra continue to rise robustly to \u2248 400 h\u22121Mpc, implying more\npower at large scales than in the APM galaxy power spectrum measured by Baugh &\nEfstathiou.\nWe split the QSO sample into two redshift bins and find little evolution in the\namplitude of the power spectrum, consistent with the result for the QSO correlation\nfunction. In models with \u2126m \u223c>0.1 this represents evidence for a QSO-mass bias that\nevolves as a function of time.\nThe QSO power spectrum may show a spike feature at \u2248 90h\u22121Mpc assuming\nthe \u039b cosmology or \u2248 65h\u22121Mpc assuming an EdS cosmology. Although the spike\nappears to reproduce in both the North and South strips and in two independent\nredshift ranges, its statistical significance is still marginal and more data is needed to\ntest further its reality.\nWe compare the QSO power spectra to CDM models to obtain a constraint on\nthe shape parameter, \u0393. For two choices of cosmology (\u2126m=1, \u2126\u039b=0 and \u2126m=0.3,\n\u2126\u039b=0.7), we find the best fit model has \u0393 \u2248 0.1 \u00b1 0.1. In addition, we have shown\nthat a power spectrum analysis of the Hubble Volume \u039bCDM mock QSO catalogues\nwith \u0393 = 0.17 as input, produces a result which is statistically consistent with the\ndata. The analysis of the mock catalogues also indicates that the above results for\n\u0393 are unlikely to be dominated by systematic effects due to the current catalogue\nwindow. We conclude that the form of the QSO power spectrum shows large-scale\npower significantly in excess of the standard CDM prediction, similar to that seen in\nlocal galaxy surveys at intermediate scales.\nKey words: surveys - quasars, quasars: general, large-scale structure of\nUniverse, cosmology: observations\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS\n2 F. Hoyle et al\n1 INTRODUCTION\nGalaxy surveys have allowed us to study the large scale\nstructure in the local Universe. Large clusters of galaxies\nand voids have been detected in these surveys and they have\nplaced constraints on cosmological parameters and models\nof structure formation. However, large area (> 100 deg2),\ngalaxy redshift surveys have so far only probed cluster-\ning out to z \u223c< 0.1. Even the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Sur-\nvey (Colless 1998) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Gunn\n& Weinberg 1995) will only observe galaxies with redshifts\n\u223c< 0.3. Surveys such as the Canada-France Redshift Sur-\nvey (Crampton et al. 1995) and the CNOC Survey (Yee et\nal. 2000) have probed galaxy clustering out past z = 0.5\nand, in the future, the DEEP (Davis & Faber 1998) and\nVIRMOS (Le Fe`vre 1998) Surveys will probe galaxy clus-\ntering out past z \u2248 1. Steidel and collaborators have even\ndeveloped techniques from which galaxies can be selected\nat higher redshifts by looking for the Lyman break (Steidel\net al. 1995, Steidel et al. 1999). However these deep sur-\nveys currently only cover a small area of sky and the result-\ning \u2018pencil beams\u2019 are unsuitable for direct power spectrum\nmeasurements. If we wish to measure the power spectrum\nof clustering out to high redshifts over a wide area in a rea-\nsonably short time period, then different techniques or a\ndifferent class of object are required.\nSince the work of Osmer (1981), redshift surveys of\nQuasi-Stellar Objects (QSOs) have been used to probe\nclustering at high redshifts. The initial attempts to mea-\nsure QSO clustering proved inconclusive, due to the low\nnumber density of QSOs and the inhomogeneous nature\nof the surveys. However, it was demonstrated in the mid-\n1980\u2019s that QSOs are clustered, at least on small r <\n10h\u22121Mpc scales, and that the amplitude of QSO clustering\nis similar to that of present day, optically selected galax-\nies (Shaver 1984, Shanks et al. 1986, Shanks et al. 1987).\nMore recently, several groups have looked at the evolution\nof QSO clustering. Croom & Shanks (1996) found that the\namplitude of QSO clustering remains approximately con-\nstant with redshift, whereas La Franca, Andreani & Cris-\ntiani (1998) found that the clustering amplitude of opti-\ncally bright QSOs evolves slowly with redshift, such that\nthe clustering amplitude of high redshift QSOs is 2\u03c3 higher\nthan that of low redshift QSOs. However, existing surveys of\nQSOs are still fairly small, for example, the Durham\/AAT\nSurvey (Boyle 1986) contains \u2248 400 QSOs and Large Bright\nQSO Survey (Hewitt, Foltz & Chaffee 1995) contains 1,053\nQSOs. Measurements of some clustering statistics have been\nhampered by the small number of objects contained in the\nsurvey or the limited sky coverage of the surveys.\nOur knowledge of the structure of the Universe at high\nredshifts will be drastically improved once the 2dF QSO\nRedshift Survey (2QZ, Croom et al. 1998a, Boyle et al. 2000,\nCroom et al. 2001) and the QSO part of the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (Gunn & Weinberg 1995) are finished. These\nsurveys will contain at least a factor of 25 more QSOs and\ncover a larger area of sky than existing QSO surveys. One\nof the key aims of both surveys is to measure the clustering\nof QSOs out to \u2248 1000h\u22121Mpc with greater accuracy than\nis possible with existing surveys. For example, the increased\nnumber of QSOs in the 2dF QSO survey should reduce the\nerrors on the measured correlation function by at least a\nfactor of 5 on scales \u223c> 10h\n\u22121Mpc (Croom et al. 2001).\nThe power spectrum is now established as one of the\nfavoured methods of quantifying clustering (Baugh & Ef-\nstathiou 1994, Tadros & Efstathiou 1996, Lin et al. 1996,\nHoyle et al. 1999). One advantage of the power spectrum\nover the two-point correlation function is that the two-point\ncorrelation function is affected by uncertainties in the mean\ndensity on all scales, whereas the power spectrum is only\naffected by these uncertainties on the largest scales (Cole,\nFisher & Weinberg 1995). Ideally, we would like to measure\nthe power spectrum of the mass density field, as this is the\nstatistic predicted by models of structure formation. How-\never, we are only able to observe the light in the Universe.\nTherefore, we generally measure the power spectrum of ob-\njects such as galaxies, clusters and QSOs, although there are\npromising methods for measuring the mass power spectrum\nfrom Lyman alpha forest systems (Croft et al. 1998) and\nfrom weak lensing (Kaiser, Wilson & Luppino 2000).\nHowever, if the bias is scale independent, then although\nthe amplitude of the QSO power spectrum may be different\nto that of the mass, the form of the QSO power spectrum will\ndirectly probe the shape of the mass power spectrum; the as-\nsumption of scale independent bias may be more appropriate\nat large scales (Coles 1993, Mann, Peacock & Heavens 1998).\nThe power spectrum has never before been measured\nfrom optically selected QSOs. QSOs are detected out to high\nredshifts and so QSO surveys have a large volume. However,\nexisting surveys only cover small areas of sky and contain\nonly a small number of QSOs. The survey geometry and low\nQSO number density within the surveys would have severely\nrestricted the range of scales over which the power spectrum\ncould have been reliably measured.\nIn this paper, we apply a power spectrum analysis to the\n10k release catalogue. A correlation function analysis of the\nidentical sample has been performed by Croom et al. (2000).\nWe describe the current data set in Section 2 and look at\nthe angular distribution of the QSOs in order to create the\nrandom catalogues needed in the power spectrum analysis.\nIn Section 3 we briefly describe the method of power spec-\ntrum analysis and in Section 4 we test the measurement of\nthe power spectrum from the current survey window using\nmock catalogues drawn from the Virgo consortiums Hubble\nVolume lightcone simulation (Frenk et al. 2000). In Section\n5 we compare the QSO power spectrum to power spectra of\npresent day galaxies and clusters and we see how the QSO\npower spectrum evolves with redshift. In Section 6 we com-\npare the QSO power spectrum with power spectra of models\nof large scale structure and in Section 7 we draw our con-\nclusions.\n2 THE 10K CATALOGUE\nIn this paper, we analyse QSOs that will be contained in the\nfirst public release of the 2QZ, known as the 10k Catalogue.\nThe catalogue will contain 10681 QSOs and will be released\nto the community in the first half of 2001. This catalogue\nwill contain the most spectroscopically complete fields (i.e.\nfields in which more than 85 per cent of objects have been\nidentified) that were observed prior to November 2000. It\nwill eventually be available from www.2dfquasar.org.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe QSO Power Spectrum from the 10k Catalogue 3\nFigure 1. Panel (a) shows the number of QSOs per 0.1 bin of\nredshift in the SGC (solid histogram) and the NGC (dashed his-\ntogram). The lines show the polynomial fits to the N(z) distri-\nbution of the QSOs in the SGC and NGC with redshifts in the\nrange 0.3 < z < 2.9. The polynomials have been normalised to\nmatch the number of QSOs in each strip.\nQSO candidates are identified from broad band ubJr\ncolours from Automatic Plate Measuring (APM) facility\nmeasurements of UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST) photo-\ngraphic plates. This colour selection gives a photometric\ncompleteness of better that 90 per cent up to z \u2248 2.2 (Boyle\net al. 2000). The spectra of the objects are obtained us-\ning the 2dF instrument on the AAT. The data is reduced\nusing the 2dF pipeline reduction system (Bailey and Glaze-\nbrook 1999) and objects are identified as QSOs by an auto-\nmated procedure known as AUTOZ (Miller et al. 2001). AUTOZ\nalso identifies the QSO redshifts; these have also been visu-\nally checked by two independent observers.\nObservations have been made over two 5\u00d775 deg2 strips\nin the North and South Galactic Cap regions. The North\nGalactic Cap strip is centred at \u03b4 = 0\u25e6 with 09h50m \u223c< \u03b1 \u223c<\n14h50m, while the South Galactic Cap strip is centred at\n\u03b4 = \u221230\u25e6, with 21h40m \u223c< \u03b1 \u223c< 03\nh15m. We will refer to\nthese regions as the NGC and SGC respectively. The finished\nsurvey will cover an area of 740 deg2. See Croom (1997),\nSmith (1998) and Smith et al. (2001) for further details of\nthe photometric catalogue.\nFor each QSO, we have an angular position and a red-\nshift. In order to convert from a redshift into a comov-\ning distance, we need to adopt a cosmology. We consider\nan \u2126m=1.0, \u2126\u039b=0.0 cosmology (EdS hereafter) and an\n\u2126m=0.3, \u2126\u039b=0.7 cosmology (referred to as the \u039b cosmol-\nogy hereafter). Other cosmologies, such as open cosmologies,\ncould also be considered but here we restrict our analysis\nto flat cosmologies, consistent with the recent results from\nballoon experiments such as Boomerang (de Bernardis et\nal. 2000) and Maxima (Balbi et al. 2000).\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 2. The radial number density of QSOs in bins of\n\u2206r = 50h\u22121Mpc in the SGC (solid line) calculated assuming\nEdS (a) and \u039b (b). The dashed lines show the number density as\nmeasured from the random catalogues, normalised to match the\nnumber density of the QSOs. The number density varies slowly as\na function of scale, decreasing only by a factor of approximately\nthree over the range 0.3 < z < 2.2, indicated by the arrows. At\nhigher redshifts, the number density decreases rapidly.\n2.1 Constructing the Random Catalogue\n2.1.1 The Radial Selection Function\nThe power spectrum measured directly from a QSO red-\nshift survey is a convolution of the power spectrum of QSO\nclustering with the power spectrum of the survey geome-\ntry. In order to estimate the power spectrum of the survey\ngeometry, or window function, we generate a catalogue of\nrandom points which have the same angular and radial se-\nlection function as the QSOs but otherwise are unclustered.\nRedshifts are drawn at random according to the polyno-\nmial N(z) fit over the range of redshift and geometry of the\nsample under consideration. Figure 1 shows the N(z) distri-\nbution of all the QSOs in the NGC (dashed histogram) and\nSGC (solid histogram). The line corresponding to each his-\ntogram shows the polynomial fit scaled to match the number\nof QSOs in each strip.\nFigure 2 shows the radial selection function of QSOs in\nthe SGC (solid line) and in the random catalogue (dashed\nline) assuming EdS (a) and assuming the \u039b cosmology (b).\nOver a wide range of redshift the selection function of the\nrandom catalogue accurately reproduces that of the QSOs.\nThe radial selection function of the QSOs only varies slowly\nas a function of scale over the range of redshifts 0.3 < z <\n2.2, indicated by the arrows. The value of n(r) changes by\nonly a factor of \u22483 over the range of scales corresponding\nto 0.3 < z < 2.2, whereas the value of n(r) for galaxies\nchanges by a far greater factor over a far smaller range of\nscales (for example see Figure 2 in Hoyle et al. (1999)). This\nis because the luminosity evolution approximately cancels\nthe effect of luminosity distance so we are always surveying\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n4 F. Hoyle et al\nthe luminosity function to approximately the same absolute\nmagnitude, relative to the break, M\u2217B , almost independent\nof redshift. As it is desirable to have a constant number\ndensity when measuring clustering statistics to remove the\nneed for a weighting scheme (other than giving all QSOs\nequal weight), we restrict the QSOs in our sample to have\nredshifts in the range 0.3 < z < 2.2. This gives us a sample\nof 8935 QSOs.\n2.1.2 The Angular Selection Function\nObservations have been made across both the NGC and\nSGC strips. An optimal tiling algorithm for the 2dF Galaxy\nRedshift survey was developed by the 2dF Consortium to\nallow as many galaxies and QSOs as possible to be observed\nin each pointing. Pointings also overlap in high density re-\ngions to maximise the coverage in all areas of the survey.\nTherefore, the 10k catalogue has a patchy angular selection\nfunction, as can be seen in Figure 1. of Croom et al. (2001),\nwhich has to be matched by the random catalogue.\nTo match the angular selection function of the QSOs,\nwe construct a completeness map. In each region defined\nby the intersection of 2dF pointings we calculate the num-\nber of objects observed and divide this by the number of\ncandidates within that region to define the fractional obser-\nvational completeness. This allows us to estimate the com-\npleteness in areas where two or more 2dF fields overlap.\nThe completeness map is then rebinned to 1\u2019x1\u2019 bins and\nthe number of random points in each bin is weighted by this\nfractional completeness.\nWe also account for the extinction due to galactic dust\nas this changes the effective magnitude limit of the survey as\na function of position. We use the estimate of the dust red-\ndening, E(B-V), as a function of position given by Schlegel,\nFinkbeiner & Davis (1998) and weight the random distribu-\ntion by\nWext(\u03b1, \u03b4) = 10\n\u2212\u03b2AbJ (1)\nwhere Abj = 4.035E(B-V) and \u03b2 = 0.3, the slope of the\nQSO number counts at the magnitude limit of the survey,\nbj=20.85. The correction for dust has little effect on the\npower spectrum out to scales of 300h\u22121Mpc for the EdS\ncosmology, 400h\u22121Mpc for the \u039b cosmology.\nOne further effect that could influence the shape of the\npower spectrum on large scales is due to possible errors in\nthe zero-point calibration of the UKST plates. A conserva-\ntive estimate of the current uncertainty is \u22480.2 mag (Smith\net al. 2001), although further CCD photometry is currently\nbeing obtained and we expect that the uncertainty in the\nzero-point calibration will be considerably lower in the final\ncatalogue.\nWith a QSO number count slope of \u03b2=0.3, a 0.2 mag\nchange in the zero-point calibration would change the ex-\npected QSO number density by \u224815 per cent. To estimate\nthe effect this has on the QSO power spectrum, we gener-\nate different realisations of the random catalogues including\nplate-to-plate variations in the zero-point calibration. These\nare introduced by randomly varying the number density of\npoints in the random catalogue on each UKST plate by\nr.m.s. 15 per cent. The uncertainty this introduces into the\nQSO power spectrum estimate is then given by the disper-\nsion in the power spectra obtained from each realisation. We\nFigure 3.

The window function of the NGC is very similar to that\nof the SGC and both are a steep power law out to scales of \u2248\n300h\u22121Mpc (\u2248 400h\u22121Mpc for the \u039b cosmology) as opposed to\n\u2248 450h\u22121Mpc (600h\u22121Mpc) when the survey is finished.\nfind that the fractional error introduced by this uncertainty\nvaries between 1 and 5 per cent up to scales of 300h\u22121Mpc\n(400h\u22121Mpc in the \u039b case), where the QSO power spec-\ntrum can be robustly measured. On these scales the frac-\ntional FKP errors (discussed below) are \u224830 per cent, and\ntherefore the total error is increased by \u223c< 1%, less than the\npotential systematic error.\nIn Figure 3 we show the window function of the current\n2QZ in the SGC (solid line) compared to the expected win-\ndow function of a finished 5\u00d775 deg2 strip (dashed line) cal-\nculated assuming EdS (a) and \u039b (b). The window function of\nthe NGC is very similar in slope and amplitude as although\nmore QSOs have been observed on the SGC strip, the QSOs\nhave been observed more randomly over the NGC strip.\nBoth window functions are steep power laws proportional\nto k\u22124 out to scales of \u2248 300h\u22121Mpc (\u2248 400h\u22121Mpc for\nthe \u039b cosmology) as opposed to \u2248 500h\u22121Mpc (600h\u22121Mpc\nfor the \u039b cosmology) when the survey is finished (see Hoyle\n2000). We conclude that geometric effects (dust, plate-to-\nplate variations in the zero points, window function of the\nsurvey) do not effect the shape of the QSO power spec-\ntrum on scales \u223c< 300h\n\u22121Mpc assuming the EdS cosmology\n(\u223c< 400h\n\u22121Mpc for the \u039b cosmology).\n3 MEASURING THE QSO POWER\nSPECTRUM\n3.1 Power Spectrum Estimation\nThe power spectrum estimator that we adopt is similar to\nthat given Tadros & Efstathiou (1996) and the same as that\ngiven in Hoyle et al. (1999). We outline the details below.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe QSO Power Spectrum from the 10k Catalogue 5\nThe Fourier transform of the observed QSO density\nfield, within a periodic volume V , is given by\nn\u02c6\u25e6(k) =\n1\nV\n\u2211\ni\neik.xi(r). (2)\nwhere the xi(r) refer to the spatial positions of the QSOs.\nThe Fourier transform of the survey window function is ap-\nproximated by:\nW\u02c6e(k) =\n1\nV\n\u2211\ni\neik.xi(r), (3)\nwhere this time the xi(r) refer to the spatial positions of\nthe random points (cf equations 7, 8 and 9 of Tadros & Ef-\nstathiou 1996 and equations 3 and 4 in Hoyle et al. 1999).\nDue to the large number of unclustered random points\nused, shot noise makes a negligible contribution to this esti-\nmate. The power spectra of the survey window function,\nshown in Figure 3, are much steeper than the expected\nQSO power spectrum, falling off as \u221d k\u22124 for wavenum-\nbers log(k\/hMpc\u22121) > \u22121.7. Therefore the main effect of\nthe convolution with the survey window function is to alter\nthe shape of the power spectrum only on scales larger than\n300h\u22121Mpc (400 h\u22121Mpc assuming the \u039b cosmology).\nFollowing Tadros & Efstathiou, we define a quantity\nwith a mean value of zero:\n\u03b4(k) = n\u02c6\u25e6(k)\u2212 \u03b1W\u02c6e(k), (4)\nwhere \u03b1 is the ratio of the number of QSOs to random points\nin samples with constant number density. The power spec-\ntrum of QSO clustering is then estimated using:\nPe(k) =\n[\n1\nN2ran\n1\nV\n\u2211\nk\u2032\n(\nV 2\n\u2223\u2223We(k\u2032)\u2223\u22232 \u2212 1\nNran\n)]\u22121\n\u00d7\n(\nV 2|\u03b4(k)|2\nN2QSO\n\u2212 1\nNQSO\n\u2212 1\nNran\n)\n. (5)\nWe use a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to compute the\npower spectrum and bin the Fourier modes up logarithmi-\ncally to reduce the covariance between each bin.\nThe limit beyond which a power spectrum cannot be\nmeasured using a FFT is known as the Nyquist frequency.\nThis is the frequency at which the grid samples the wave\nexactly twice per cycle:\nkNyq =\n1\n2\n2pi\n\u2206\n, (6)\nwhere, for a 2563 FFT and a box of size 4000h\u22121Mpc, the\ninterval \u2206=4000\/256 h\u22121Mpc. The limit out to which the\npower spectrum measurement is reliable depends on the grid\nassignment scheme, and is a fraction of kNyq. Using the near-\nest grid point assignment scheme, klim \u2248 1\/2 kNyq (Hatton\n1999), which, for the above box size, corresponds to a value\nof log(klim) \u2248 \u22121 or a scale of \u2248 60h\u22121Mpc.\nTo enable measurements of the power spectrum on\nsmaller scales, we use a direct method of computing the\nFourier transform. This method is time intensive and can\nonly be applied to a small number of particles (so cannot be\napplied to the random catalogue). For the direct method,\nwe make the assumption that equation 4 can be rewritten\nas \u03b4(k) = n\u02c6(k), which is only valid on small scales where\nFigure 4. The solid line shows the input power spectrum to the\nHubble Volume simulation. The dashed lines show power spectra\nof the mass in the simulation in bins of 0.5 in redshift, centred on\n(reading down) 0.25, 0.75, 1.25, 1.75 and 2.25. The points show\nthe power spectrum of the mass in the light cone out to z < 2.4.\nThe amplitude of this power spectrum is close to the amplitude of\nthe power spectrum at the average redshift of the sample which\nis z\u00af = 1.4.\nthe window function has a small amplitude (Figure 3). Us-\ning mock catalogues drawn from the Hubble Volume simu-\nlation (see Section 4), we find that on scales smaller than\n\u2248 100h\u22121Mpc (log(k) \u2248 \u22121.2) this approximation is accu-\nrate.\n3.2 Error Determination\nThe errors on the power spectrum are estimated using the\nmethod of Feldman, Kaiser & Peacock (1994), equation\n2.3.2, assuming that all QSOs carry equal weight when es-\ntimating the QSO power spectrum. The error is given by\n\u03c32(k)\nP 2(k)\n=\n(2pi)3[1 + 1\nn(r)P (k)\n]2\nVkVs\n(7)\nwhere Vk is the volume of each bin in k-space, estimated by\nVk = Nk(\u2206k)\n3 with Nk the number of independent modes\nin the k-shell and (\u2206k)3 the volume of one k-mode. Vs is the\nvolume of the survey. Over a wide range of scales these er-\nrors are found to be in reasonable agreement with errors es-\ntimated from the dispersion over power spectrum estimates\nfrom the Hubble Volume mock catalogues (see Section 4 and\nHoyle 2000). On the smallest scales, the FKP errors appear\nsmaller than those from the mock catalogues. FKP errors\nare only valid in the fully linear regime and non-linearities\non small scales may mean they underestimate the true error\non these scales (Meiksin & White 1999).\nTo obtain a single 2QZ power spectrum for each as-\nsumed cosmology, we average the power spectrum of the\nQSOs in the NGC and SGC together, weighting by the in-\nverse of the variance on each scale.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n6 F. Hoyle et al\nFigure 5. The points show the power spectrum measured from\nthe biased mock catalogues, the solid line shows the mass power\nspectrum and the dashed line shows the mass power spectrum\nmultiplied by a factor of b2=4.7. Both the mass and the biased\ncatalogues have the selection function of the QSOs imprinted on\nthem and are measured in redshift space.\n4 TESTING P(K) ESTIMATORS USING THE\nHUBBLE VOLUME\nTo test the estimator of the power spectrum and the effect\nof the window function on the recovered power spectrum,\nwe have constructed mock catalogues that approximately\nmatch the clustering and geometry expected from the fi-\nnal QSO sample. Full details of the mock catalogues can be\nfound in Hoyle (2000). We review the features most perti-\nnent to the analysis here.\nThe mock catalogues are constructed from the Virgo\nconsortium\u2019s Hubble Volume simulation (see Frenk et al.\n2000). The simulation has a \u039bCDM cosmology with \u2126m=0.3,\n\u2126b=0.04 and \u2126\u039b=0.7, h=0.7 and normalised to \u03c38=0.9 at\npresent day and with shape parameter of \u0393 = 0.17. The\nsimulation covers an area of three 5\u00d775 deg2 and extends\nto redshift \u2248 4. The simulation has a lightcone output such\nthat the evolution of the dark matter is fully accounted for.\nHowever, in Figure 4 we show that evolution has little ef-\nfect on the shape of the mass power spectrum on the scales\nwhere it can be robustly measured. The solid line is the in-\nput power spectrum to the Hubble Volume simulation. The\ndashed lines show the power spectra of the mass in the sim-\nulation in bins of 0.5 in redshift centred on (reading down)\n0.25, 0.75, 1.25, 1.75 and 2.25. The points show the power\nspectrum of the mass over the light cone out to z < 2.5, the\naverage redshift of the mass is z \u2248 1.4. This power spec-\ntrum does indeed lie between the power spectra centred on\nz = 1.25 and z = 1.75 and all three power spectra have very\nsimilar shapes.\nWe bias the dark matter particles to approximately\nmatch the clustering expected from 2QZ. Initial measure-\nments of the correlation function suggested that the corre-\nlation length of the 2QZ QSOs would be \u2248 6h\u22121Mpc, as-\nsuming the \u039b cosmology, and that the comoving correlation\nlength would be roughly constant with redshift. See Croom\net al. (2001) for the latest measurements of the correlation\nfunction.\nThe biasing prescription is described in full detail in\nHoyle (2000). We provide a brief summary here. We split the\nsimulation into slices of 0.2 in redshift. Within each slice,\nwe bin the redshift space density field onto a grid of cell\nsize 20h\u22121Mpc and calculate the mean density and standard\ndeviation for each cell. Following Cole et al. (1998), the bias\nprobability is given by\nP (\u03bd) =\n{\nexp(\u03b1\u03bd + \u03b2\u03bd3\/2) if \u03bd \u2265 0\nexp(\u03b1\u03bd) otherwise,\n(8)\nwhere \u03bd is the number of standard deviations of the cell\ndensity away from the mean cell density. We fix \u03b1 to be\n0.15, similar to the value given in Cole et al. such that the\nreal space clustering at present day in a \u039bCDM simulation\nwith parameters similar to those of the Hubble Volume ap-\nproximately matches that of the APM galaxy survey (Baugh\n& Efstathiou 1993). We vary \u03b2 until the correlation length\nof biased particles in each redshift slice is consistent with\n6h\u22121Mpc over the range 5 < r < 30h\u22121Mpc, assuming that\nthe correlation function has the form \u03be(r) = (r\/r\u25e6)\n\u22121.7.\nAs the clustering amplitude of the dark matter de-\ncreases with redshift proportional to the square of the linear\ngrowth factor, the bias factor required to keep the cluster-\ning amplitude constant with redshift must correspondingly\nincrease with redshift, proportional to the growth factor. At\nthe average redshift of the survey, the bias factor, b, is ap-\nproximately\n\u221a\n4.7.\nWe then imprint the radial selection function of the\nQSOs onto the mock catalogues as described in Section 2.1\nand split the simulation into 5\u00d775 deg2 slices to match the\nexpected final angular selection function.\nThe net result is shown in Figure 5. The points show\nP(k) for the biased particles, the solid line shows P(k) of\nthe mass and the dashed line shows b2P(k)mass. In both\ncases, the QSO selection function has been applied to the\ncatalogues and the redshift space distortions included in the\nparticle positions. By design, over a wide range of scales,\nthere is just a linear bias between the mass and the biased\nparticles.\nIn Figure 6, we test the method of estimating the power\nspectrum on the mock catalogues of the finished 2QZ. The\nsolid line shows the input power spectrum to the Hubble Vol-\nume simulation. This power spectrum is in real space and is\nnormalised to match the amplitude of the mock catalogues.\nThe circles in the left plot show the power spectrum from\nthe mock catalogues, averaged over the three realisations,\nestimated using a FFT. On intermediate to large scales, (\n\u22121.8 < log(k) < \u22121) the power spectrum from the mock\ncatalogues using the FFT reproduces the shape of the input\npower spectrum very well. On the very largest scales, the\npoints are systematically below the line due to the effects\nof the window function, although as the power spectrum\ncannot be accurately measured on these scales the two are\nconsistent. It is very difficult to deconvolve fully the win-\ndow function from the true power spectrum. Instead of at-\ntempting this, we estimate the scale on which the window\nfunction affects the shape of the power spectrum through\ncomparisons with the input power spectrum. Assuming the\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe QSO Power Spectrum from the 10k Catalogue 7\nFigure 6. The circles in the left panel show the power spectrum from the mock catalogues of the finished 2QZ found using a FFT. The\ntriangles in the middle plot show the power spectrum from the mock catalogues using the direct Fourier Transform method. In the right\nplot, the circles show the mock catalogue power spectrum, estimated using a FFT on scales above the arrow and the direct method on\nscales below the arrow. In all cases, the line shows the real space input power spectrum to the Hubble Volume simulation, renormalised\nto mimic the effects of bulk motions on the power spectrum amplitude. The open symbols demonstrate the points affected by problems\nwith each different method of power spectrum estimation. On small scales, the open circles lie below the input power spectrum as these\nscales are below the FFT limit. On large scales, the open triangles lie above the input power spectrum as we have not accounted for the\nwindow function normalisation. A combination of the two methods gives a good match to the input power spectrum over a wide range\nof scales, as seen in the right hand plot.\n\u039b cosmology, the power spectrum will be free from any ef-\nfects of the window function on scale less than 400h\u22121Mpc.\nOn small scales, the circles lie below the input power spec-\ntrum. These scales are below the limit of the FFT and the\npower spectrum cannot be robustly measured.\nInstead, on small scales we use a direct Fourier trans-\nform to calculate the power spectrum. This is shown by\nthe triangles in the middle plot. The solid triangles re-\nproduce the input power spectrum well on scales smaller\nthan \u2248100h\u22121Mpc (log(k\/hMpc\u22121)=\u22121.2) where the win-\ndow function has little effect on the amplitude of the power\nspectrum. On larger scales, the effect of not subtracting off\nthe window function in the estimation of the power spectrum\ncan clearly be seen.\nIn the right hand plot, we show a combination of the\ntwo methods. On scales larger than the arrow, we use the\nFFT method and on scales smaller than the arrow, we use\nthe direct method. This enables a robust measurement of\nthe power spectrum over a wide range of scales. The scale at\nwhich we swap the method of estimating the power spectrum\nis the central point at which the two methods of estimating\nthe power spectrum agree within the 1\u03c3 errors.\nThe 2QZ is, however, not yet finished and currently has\na patchy angular selection function, as discussed in section\n2.1.2. To test the effect of this on the power spectrum, we\nimprint the angular selection function of the NGC and SGC\nonto each of the mock catalogues, as described in Section\n2.1.2. Figure 7(a) shows the average power spectrum after\nthe angular selection function of the NGC (filled circles) and\nthe SGC (open circles) has been imprinted onto the mock\ncatalogues. In Figure 7(b), we combine the power spectrum\nof the NGC and SGC together, weighted by the inverse of\nthe variance, to create one single mock 2QZ power spectrum.\nThe same combination of FFT and direct Fourier Transform,\nas described above, was used in the calculation of the power\nspectrum.\nOver the range of values \u22121.8 < log(k) < \u22121, the power\nspectrum from the NGC and SGC mock catalogues and the\ncombined power spectrum match the input power spectrum\nreasonably well although there is, perhaps, a slight steep-\nening of the power spectrum. On larger and smaller scales,\nthe agreement between the mock power spectra and the in-\nput power spectrum worsens compared to the agreement\nbetween the mock, finished power spectrum and the input\npower spectrum. This is due to the smaller volume of the in-\ncomplete survey and the smaller number of QSOs currently\nobserved and errors that are perhaps underestimated.\nThe tests show that even with the incomplete 2QZ, ac-\ncurate measurements of the power spectrum can be made,\nalthough over a slightly limited range of scales as compared\nto the power spectrum predicted from the final survey, with\nerrors that are larger (by a factor of \u2248 1.5) than the finished\nsurvey will have.\n5 RESULTS\n5.1 The QSO Power Spectra\nIn this Section, we present QSO power spectra measured\nfrom the NGC, SGC as well as the combined power spectra\nfor the two choices of cosmology. We measure the power\nspectrum from QSOs with redshifts in the range 0.3 < z <\n2.2 where the photometric completeness is higher than \u224890\nper cent (Boyle et al. 2000) and the number density remains\napproximately constant.\nIn Figure 8 we compare the NGC and SGC power\nspectra measured from QSOs with redshift in the range\n0.3 < z < 2.2 assuming the EdS cosmology (a) and the\n\u039b cosmology (b). The combined power spectra are shown\nin (c, EdS cosmology) and (d, \u039b cosmology). There is good\nagreement between the power spectrum measured from the\nNGC and the SGC strips over a wide range of scales.\nThe power spectra have a power-law form with\nPQSO(k) \u221d k\u22121.4 for both choices of cosmology (-1.36\u00b10.007\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n8 F. Hoyle et al\nFigure 7. The points in the left hand plot show the power spectra measure from mock SGC simulations (open circles) and mock NGC\nsimulations (closed circles). These are combined in the right hand plot, as described in the text, to give a single mock power spectrum\nwith the current angular selection function imprinted on the mock catalogues. The solid line in both plots is the input power spectrum,\nas described in Figure 6. The power spectrum measured with the current angular selection function imprinted matches the input power\nspectrum over a wide range of scales. In both plots, the errors are FKP errors and we use a FFT to measure the power spectra on scales\nlarger than 70h\u22121Mpc (log(k\/hMpc\u22121)=\u22121.12) and the direct method on smaller scales. The simulation has the \u039b cosmology.\nEdS and -1.41\u00b10.07 \u039b). The power-law appears to extend\nto large scales with only a slight sign of flattening beyond\nlog(k\/hMpc\u22121) < \u22121.7, (r > 300h\u22121Mpc) in the EdS case\nand beyond log(k\/hMpc\u22121) < \u22121.8 (r > 400h\u22121Mpc) in the\n\u039b case. This , if real, places strong constraints on CDMmod-\nels. CDM models predict that the power spectrum should\nturn over at a scale which depends on the shape parame-\nter, \u0393 = \u2126mh, of the power spectrum. If \u0393 > 0.25 then the\nturnover should occur on scales less than 300h\u22121Mpc. The\nfact that we do not see a turnover puts strong constraints\non the range of acceptable \u0393 values. This is discussed fur-\nther in Section 6. However, there are uncertainties in the\nmeasurement of the power spectrum on scales larger than\n300h\u22121Mpc (400h\u22121Mpc assuming the \u039b cosmology) which\nmay be limiting our ability to detect any turnover for models\nwith \u0393 values less than 0.25.\nWe tentatively identify a \u2018spike\u2019 feature\nat log(k\/hMpc\u22121) \u2248 \u22121.16 (90 h\u22121Mpc) assuming the \u039b\ncosmology and at log(k\/hMpc\u22121) \u2248 \u22121.01 (65 h\u22121Mpc) as-\nsuming the EdS. Figures 8(a,b) show that the feature seems\nto reproduce in the NGC and SGC strips. We shall see in\nFigure 12(a,b) that this feature also appears to reproduce\nin the two independent redshift bins in both cosmologies.\nIf real, such a feature might be caused by acoustic oscilla-\ntions in the baryon-radiation fluid prior to decoupling. If this\npower spectrum spike is confirmed in the analysis of the full\n2QZ, it would also provide a powerful measure of the world\nmodel. Such features do not evolve in scale as a function of\nredshift and a comparison between the 2QZ P(k), measured\nat a mean redshift of 1.4 and the galaxy P(k) measured at\nz\u22480 may allow constraints on \u2126m and \u2126\u039b via the require-\nment to maintain the feature at the same scale in both power\nspectra. For example, preliminary reports of results from the\n2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey power spectrum (Peacock et al.\n2001) show some possible indications of a spike detected in\ntheir data at log(k\/hMpc\u22121) \u2248 -1.12 (85h\u22121Mpc), assuming\nthe \u039b cosmology, although the 2dFGRS team do not claim\nthat any single isolated feature in their data is significant. In\nan EdS cosmology this feature would lie at log(k\/hMpc\u22121)\n\u2248 -1.08 (75h\u22121Mpc). The low redshift galaxy result may\ntherefore be somewhat more consistent with the high red-\nshift QSO result assuming the \u039b cosmology but more QSO\nand galaxy data will clearly be needed at both high and low\nredshift before a final conclusion can be drawn.\nWe have used the CMBFAST programme (Seljak & Zal-\ndarriaga 1996) to see how close the feature might be in scale\nand amplitude to the second baryon-radiation acoustic peak.\nGenerally, for a wide range of \u2126b and h in both the EdS and\nthe \u039b cosmology, the peak scale appears at \u223c>25 per cent\nsmaller wavenumber than the predicted second peak. Also\nthe amplitude of the peak appears to demand a higher value\nof \u2126b than used in e.g. the \u039bCDM Hubble Volume model\n(\u2126\u039b=0.7, \u2126m=0.3 \u2126b=0.04, h=0.7). To illustrate this, the\nHubble Volume input spectrum is shown in Figure 8(d) to-\ngether with a CMBFAST prediction with \u2126\u039b=0.7, \u2126m=0.3,\n\u2126b=0.1, h=0.5. This model gives as good a fit as any to the\nobserved spike feature but, although having a reasonable\namplitude, it lies at log(k\/hMpc\u22121)=-1.05 rather than the\nobserved log(k\/hMpc\u22121)=-1.16. Figure 8(c) shows a CMB-\nFAST model with \u2126m=1, \u2126b = 0.3, h=0.3 again as an ex-\nample of a model which gets as close as any to matching the\nobserved feature. However, again the predicted spike lies at\ntoo large a wavenumber, log(k\/hMpc\u22121)=-0.82, compared\nto the observed spike scale of log(k\/hMpc\u22121)=-1.02. We also\nnote that Meiksin, White & Peacock (1999) have suggested\nthat quasi-linear evolution may reduce the predicted ampli-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe QSO Power Spectrum from the 10k Catalogue 9\nFigure 8.

The solid lines in (c, d) show models with an increased\nbaryon fraction (described in the text) to try and reproduce the feature present in the QSO power spectra. The dashed line in (d) is the\ninput power spectrum to the Hubble Volume simulation. QSOs have redshifts in the range 0.3 < z < 2.2.\ntude of the second acoustic peak. We postpone further dis-\ncussion of the theoretical implications of the spike feature\nuntil we see if it reproduces in our full 25k 2QZ sample.\n5.2 Comparison with P(k) from Galaxy and\nCluster Surveys\nThe power spectrum of galaxies has been measured from\nseveral different galaxy surveys but so far only out to \u2248\n100h\u22121Mpc scales. In Figure 9, we compare the power spec-\ntrum estimated from the QSOs currently observed in 2QZ,\nassuming two different cosmologies, with a power spectrum\nfrom the Durham\/UKST survey (Hoyle et al. 1999). The\nlines show the QSO power spectrum, estimated assuming\nthe \u039b cosmology (solid line) and the EdS cosmology (dashed\nline). The circles show a flux limited galaxy power spectrum\nwith P=8000h\u22123Mpc3 fixed in the weighting scheme of Feld-\nman, Kaiser & Peacock (1994) .\nFigure 9 shows that the form of the QSO and galaxy\nredshift space power spectra are similar. The slopes are sta-\ntistically consistent whether the QSO power spectrum is\ncomputed in the EdS or \u039b cosmology. However, in the final\nsample there may be a possible cosmological test afforded\nby comparing the slopes of QSO power spectra with power\nspectra obtained at lower redshift, if the bias can be as-\nsumed to be scale independent.

A comparison of galaxy and QSO power spectra.\nThe lines show the QSO power spectra with the \u039b cosmology\n(solid line) and the EdS cosmology (dashed line) assumed. The\ncircles show a flux limited power spectrum measured from the\nDurham\/UKST Survey (Hoyle et al. 1999). The errors on the\nQSO power spectra are FKP errors and the errors on the galaxy\npower spectrum are from mock catalogues.\nin the \u039b case has a amplitude slightly lower than that of\nthe galaxy power spectra. If an EdS cosmology is assumed,\nthe amplitude of the QSO power spectrum (dashed line) is\napproximately a factor of \u22483 lower than the galaxy power\nspectra. Croom et al. (2001) found very similar results in\nthe comparison of galaxy and QSO clustering amplitudes in\ntheir correlation function analysis of the 2QZ data.\nWe also compare the QSO power spectra to the real\nspace APM galaxy power spectrum of Baugh & Efstathiou\n(1994), inferred from measurements of the angular corre-\nlation function, w(\u03b8). The lines in Figure 10 are the QSO\npower spectra, assuming the two different cosmologies as dis-\ncussed above. The squares show the APM power spectrum.\nThe real space APM galaxy power spectrum has a lower am-\nplitude than the Durham\/UKST redshift space power spec-\ntrum as bulk motions of galaxies increase amplitude of the\nredshift space power spectrum (Kaiser 1987). There is also\nsome uncertainty in the normalisation of the APM power\nspectrum due to the inversion technique of estimating the\npower spectrum (Carlton Baugh, private communication).\nOn scales out to 100 h\u22121Mpc (log(k\/hMpc\u22121)=\u22121.2), there\nis reasonable agreement between the amplitudes of the dif-\nferent power spectra. On scales larger than 100h\u22121Mpc, the\nAPM power spectrum flattens off, whereas the QSO power\nspectra continue to rise. We believe that the QSO power\nspectra measurements are robust to 300h\u22121Mpc assuming\nthe EdS cosmology (400h\u22121Mpc assuming the \u039b cosmol-\nogy). Therefore we find even more large scale power than\nin the APM power spectrum and possibly even more power\nthan the \u039bCDM models (see Section 6).\nA final comparison is made between the QSO power\nspectra and the power spectra of rich clusters of galaxies.

The errors on the QSO\npower spectra are FKP errors. The errors on the APM power\nspectrum are obtained by measuring the scatter in power spectra\nobtained from four separate regions of the APM survey.\nFigure 11.

The cluster power spectra are\nfound assuming \u2126m=1 (filled circles) and \u2126m=0.2, \u2126\u039b=0.8\n(open circles). As the clusters are only observed out to a\nredshift of \u22480.2, the effects of cosmology on the clustering\namplitude are small so the two cluster power spectra have a\nsimilar amplitude and shape. The slopes of the QSO power\nspectra are similar to those for the clusters for both models,\nwithin the overlapping range of scales. As can clearly be seen\nin Figure 11, the QSOs have a lower clustering amplitude\nthan the present day rich clusters. We shall see below that\nthe QSO power spectrum amplitude only evolves slowly with\nredshift and so it is meaningful to compare the QSO and\ncluster power spectra. The relative bias between the two\ntypes of power spectra is brel \u2248\n\u221a\n5 for the \u039b cosmology and\nbrel \u2248\n\u221a\n10 for the EdS cosmology.\n5.3 The Evolution of QSO Clustering\nTo determine how QSO clustering evolves as a function of\nredshift, we split the QSOs in each strip of the survey into\ntwo redshift bins containing roughly equal numbers of QSOs,\none with QSOs in the range 0.3 < z < 1.4 (z\u00af = 1.0) and the\nother with 1.4 < z < 2.4 (z\u00af = 1.8). The power spectrum is\nthen measured from each subsample on each strip, assuming\nthe two cosmologies discussed in Section 2. The results from\nthe NGC and SGC for each redshift bin and for each cosmol-\nogy are averaged together as before. All the power spectra\nin Figure 12(a) are estimated assuming the EdS cosmology,\nwhilst in panel (b), the \u039b cosmology is assumed. In both\npanels, the solid line shows the power spectrum of all the\nQSOs, the open circles show the power spectrum of the low\nredshift QSOs and the filled circles show the power spectrum\nof the high redshift QSOs.\nWhen the QSOs are split up into the two sam-\nples, the errors on the measured power spectra are in-\ncreased. However, on scales around 100-200h\u22121Mpc (-1.2 >\nlog(k\/hMpc\u22121) > \u22121.5) the power spectrum can still be\nfairly well measured, the fractional errors are around 40 per\ncent. There is reasonable agreement between the power spec-\ntra measured from the two redshift bins over a wide range\nof scales. This suggests that QSO clustering does not evolve\nstrongly with redshift.\nThis result is consistent with the work of Croom et al.\n(2001) who have measured the clustering from the 10k QSO\ncatalogue in five bins of redshift. If the EdS cosmology is\nassumed then little evolution is seen in the clustering am-\nplitude of QSOs, consistent with Croom & Shanks (1996).\nIf the \u039b cosmology is assumed, slow evolution is seen in the\nclustering amplitude of QSOs, with QSOs at high redshift\nhaving a slightly higher clustering amplitude than QSOs at\nlow redshift.\nThe slow evolution in QSO clustering was interpreted\npreviously in terms of cosmology and the effects of QSO bias\n(see, for example, Croom & Shanks 1996). The slow evolu-\ntion either suggests that \u2126m is low, less than 0.1, so that the\ndark matter clustering does not evolve strongly with red-\nshift, or that \u2126m is fairly high, \u223c> 0.1, and that bias evolves\nas a function of redshift to counteract the decrease in ampli-\ntude of the dark matter clustering. Croom et al. (2001) make\na detailed comparison between the evolution of QSO cluster-\nFigure 12. The power spectrum of QSOs measured at different\nredshifts. The EdS cosmology is assumed in (a) and the \u039b cos-\nmology is assumed in (b). In both panels, the solid line shows the\npower spectrum estimated from all the QSOs with 0.3 < z < 2.2,\nas in Figure 13. The open circles show the power spectrum of\nQSOs with redshifts in the range 0.3 < z < 1.4 and the filled\ncircles show the power spectrum of QSOs with redshifts in the\nrange 1.4 < z < 2.2. The errors are FKP errors.\ning and various models for the QSO-mass bias. Determining\ncosmology from the evolution of QSO clustering alone is not\npossible due to the degeneracy between cosmology and bias.\nSince the QSO power spectra have comparable ampli-\ntudes to local galaxy power spectra and since the slow QSO\nclustering evolution implies that the QSO amplitude does\nnot increase markedly at low redshift, this suggests that\nQSOs are not highly biased objects with respect to present\nday optically selected galaxies.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n12 F.

The solid line\nshows the real space input power spectra to the Hubble Volume\nsimulation. The dashed lines in show the mock catalogue redshift\nspace power spectrum and errors from Figure 7(b), discussed in\nthe text.\n6 COMPARISON WITH MODELS OF LARGE\nSCALE STRUCTURE\nAs discussed previously, it is the power spectrum of the mass\ndensity field that is predicted by models of large scale struc-\nture. If the bias between the dark matter and QSOs can\nbe written as P(k)QSO = b\n2P(k)mass, with b a constant,\nwhich could be the case on large scales (Coles 1993, Cole\net al. 1998, Mann, Peacock & Heavens 1998), it is possible\nto compare meaningfully the shapes of mass and QSO power\nspectra.\nThe power spectrum from 2QZ is measured in redshift\nspace, whereas the model power spectra are calculated in\nreal space. Small scale peculiar velocities affect the shape\nof the redshift power spectrum on small scales. However,\nthe small scale peculiar velocities should have little effect on\nthe shape of the power spectrum on scales \u223c> 5h\n\u22121Mpc (see\nHoyle 2000) which is below the scale where we can measure\nQSO power spectra.\nOn large scales, the effect of redshift space distortions\nis to boost the amplitude of the power spectrum according\nto\nPs(k) = Pr(k)\n(\n1 +\n2\n3\n\u03b2 +\n1\n5\n\u03b22\n)\n, (9)\n(Kaiser 1987) with \u03b2 = \u21260.6m \/b and r and s indicating the real\nspace and redshift space power spectra. The redshift space\ndistortions are caused by bulk motions of QSOs. If the bias\nis scale independent the redshift space power spectrum just\nhas a higher amplitude than the real space power spectrum\nbut the shapes should be consistent.\nHowever, we find that the current incompleteness may\nbe introducing a slight bias into the shape of the QSO power\nspectrum. The shape of the power spectrum from the mock\ncatalogues with the incompleteness imprinted on them is\nslightly steeper than the input power spectrum to the sim-\nulation. This is shown in Figure 13. The solid line shows\nthe input power spectrum, the long dashed line shows the\npower spectrum from the mock catalogues with the current\nangular selection function imprinted on them (as seen in\nFigure 7(b), the short dashed lines are the 1\u03c3 errors). The\npoints show the QSO power spectrum calculated assuming\nthe \u039b cosmology. On the smallest scales, the dashed line is\ninconsistent with the solid line at the 1\u03c3 level, although on\nthese small scales the FKP errors may underestimate the\ntrue error. Therefore, we fit the model power spectra to the\nQSO power spectrum, assuming the \u039b cosmology, down to\n60h\u22121Mpc (log(k\/hMpc\u22121)=\u22121.) only. We have no mock\ncatalogues with the EdS cosmology to test if incompleteness\naffects the shape of the QSO power spectrum from the 10k\nQSO catalogue, assuming the EdS cosmology. However, we\nwish to fit the models to the data over the same range of\nlog(k\/hMpc\u22121) so we fix the lower limit for the EdS case\nto be log(k\/hMpc\u22121)=\u22120.9 (50h\u22121Mpc). We set the limit\non large scales to be the scale where the geometry of the\nsurvey affects the shape of the power spectrum. This cor-\nresponds to 300h\u22121Mpc (log(k\/hMpc\u22121)=\u22121.7) in the EdS\ncosmology and 400h\u22121Mpc (log(k\/hMpc\u22121)=\u22121.8) in the\n\u039b cosmology.\nWe compare the QSO power spectra to model CDM\npower spectra with different values of \u0393, where \u0393 = \u2126mh.\nWe assume the fit to the CDM transfer function given by\nBardeen et al. (1986). The power spectrum is calculated at\nz = 1.4 rather than at z = 0 to approximate the dark matter\npower spectrum averaged over the lightcone. We assume a\nvalue of \u03c38 that matches the cluster normalisation for each\ncosmology given by Eke, Cole & Frenk (1996). For each cos-\nmology, the model power spectra are \u03c72 fitted to the QSO\npower spectrum to find the factor, beff , required to match\nthe two as well as possible.\nWe choose values of \u0393 in the range 0.05 < \u0393 < 0.5 which\nmore than covers the range of values that fit current galaxy\npower spectra, such as the APM real space power spectrum\n(Eisenstein & Zaldarriaga 1999). We note that \u039bCDM mod-\nels with \u0393 \u223c>0.3 are not physically motivated but we are just\ncomparing a range of models with different shapes to the\nQSO power spectrum and we do indeed find that models\nwith values of \u0393 \u223c> 0.3 give a poor fit to the QSO power\nspectrum with the \u039b cosmology assumed.\nIn Figure 14, we show the QSO power spectrum with\nthe EdS cosmology (open circles, a) and with the \u039b cos-\nmology (solid circles, b). The lines have different values of\n\u0393: \u0393=0.5 (solid), \u0393=0.4 (short - long dashed), \u0393=0.3 (short\ndashed), \u0393=0.2 (long dashed) and \u0393=0.1 (dotted). Models\nwith \u0393=0.5 are ruled out at more than 3\u03c3 assuming either\ncosmology. This is in agreement with results from galaxy\nsurveys. More large scale power was found in the galaxy cor-\nrelation function from the APM Survey than expected from\nthe standard CDM \u0393=0.5 model (Efstathiou, Sutherland &\nMaddox 1990). This led to variants of the CDM model, such\nas \u039bCDM and \u03c4CDM to be developed.\nIn both cases, the best agreement between the models\nand the QSO power spectra is found with a model with low\nvalues of \u0393. Models with \u0393=0.12\u00b10.10 best fit the shape\nof the QSO power spectrum assuming the EdS cosmology\nand models with lower values of \u0393 = 0.11 \u00b1 0.1 best fit the\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe QSO Power Spectrum from the 10k Catalogue 13\nFigure 14.

In both panels the matching lines\nshow the same \u0393 values with \u0393=0.5 (solid line), 0.4 (short - long\ndashed), 0.3 (short dashed), 0.2 (long dashed) and 0.1 (dotted).\nEach line is plotted at the amplitude that gives the best fit to the\nQSO power spectrum. The arrows indicate the range of scales\nover which the fit was made.\nQSO power spectrum assuming the \u039b cosmology. The input\npower spectrum to the \u039bCDM Hubble Volume has a shape\nof \u0393=0.17. This model is therefore consistent with the data\nat the 1\u03c3 level.\nThe results found here are in reasonable agreement with\nthose of Croom et al. (2001). They find that models with\n\u0393=0.5 do not provide a good fit to the correlation func-\ntion measured from the 10k QSO catalogue assuming the\nEdS and the \u039b cosmology. Models with \u0393=0.1-0.2 are re-\nquired to fit the correlation function with the \u039b cosmology\nassumed. However, models with \u0393=0.2-0.4 best fit the cor-\nrelation function if the EdS cosmology is assumed.\nThis test is quite simplistic as possible effects of the\nincompleteness have not been included in the shape of the\nmodel power spectrum, although by fitting to a limited range\nof scales we should have reduced the effect that this can\nhave on the models that fit the power spectrum. When 2QZ\nis finished, we will be able to compare the models over a\nwider range of scales and produce stronger constraints on\nthe range of acceptable \u0393 parameters.\nIn order to thoroughly test models of structure forma-\ntion, full N-body simulations, such as the Hubble Volume are\nrequired. However, due to the large volume of 2QZ, large\namounts of super-computing time are required to carry out\nsuch simulations so it is currently not possible to run them\nfor a wide range of cosmological models. Physically moti-\nvated models for selecting QSOs within the simulation are\nalso required as a linear bias between the mass and the QSOs\nmay be an over simplification, even on these large scales.\n7 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have presented the first QSO power spectrum analysis\nusing the 10k catalogue from the 2dF QSO Redshift Sur-\nvey. The QSO power spectrum has a power law form with\nPQSO(k) \u221d k\u22121.4 which appears to extend to large scales.\nThe relatively quiet galaxy clustering environment observed\nfor radio-quiet QSOs in CCD imaging experiments (Smith,\nBoyle & Maddox 2000, Croom & Shanks 1999, Smith, Boyle\n& Maddox 1995, Ellingson, Yee & Green 1991) suggests\nthat the bias problem may be no worse for QSOs than for\ngalaxies; at the r>50h\u22121Mpc scales considered here the as-\nsumption that the QSO-mass bias is scale independent may\ntherefore be reasonable. Therefore, the fact that we do not\nsee a turnover on scales up to 300h\u22121Mpc places a strong\nconstraint on the value of the shape parameter, requiring\n\u0393 \u223c< 0.25. We find that the large scale power seen in the\nQSO power spectrum is best fit by CDM models with \u0393 as\nlow as 0.1\u00b1 0.1.\nA power spectrum analysis of mock QSO catalogues,\ncreated from the Virgo Consortium\u2019s Hubble Volume \u039bCDM\nsimulation, with \u0393 = 0.17 as input, produces a result which\nis statistically consistent with the data. The analysis of the\nmock catalogues indicates that we are able to produce a first\nrobust measurement of the QSO power spectrum over more\nthan a decade in scale and thus the above results for \u0393 are\nunlikely to be dominated by systematic effects due to the\ncurrent incompleteness of the 2QZ catalogue.\nWe note that the low \u0393 values measured here from the\nshapes of the QSO power spectra are in some disagree-\nment with the best fit parameters as measured from the\nBoomerang and MAXIMA CMB power spectra (Balbi 2000,\nde Bernadis 2000). Bond et al. (2000) measures \u2126bh\n2=0.03\nand \u2126CDMh\n2=0.17 for \u2126mh\n2=0.2 in a spatially flat model.\nFor h=0.65 this implies \u0393 = \u2126mh = 0.3 which is rejected at\n2\u03c3 in Figures 14(a, b). It will be interesting to see if this dis-\ncrepancy persists as more CMB and 2QZ data accumulate.\nWe measure the QSO power spectrum in two bins of\nredshift and find that the clustering can only evolve slowly\nas a function of redshift as QSOs with a median redshift\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n14 F. Hoyle et al\nof z\u00af=1.0 have a clustering amplitude consistent with that\nof QSOs with a median redshift of z\u00af=1.8. This is consis-\ntent with the results of Croom et al. (2001), who find little\nevolution in the amplitude of QSO clustering as a function\nof redshift if the EdS cosmology is assumed and only slow\nevolution if a \u039b cosmology is assumed.\nThe QSO power spectrum, which is therefore broadly\nindependent of redshift, lies close in amplitude to the power-\nspectrum of local, optically selected galaxies. The range of\nscales where the two overlap is limited, but once the 2dF\nGalaxy Redshift Survey is finished, an interesting compar-\nison between power spectra of optically selected QSOs and\ngalaxies over a wide range of scales will be possible. The\npower spectrum of rich galaxy clusters measured by Tadros,\nEfstathiou & Dalton (1998) has a far higher clustering am-\nplitude than the QSO power spectrum, again suggesting that\nthe QSO-mass bias is much closer to galaxies than galaxy\nclusters.\nWe tentatively detect a \u2018spike\u2019 feature at \u2248 90h\u22121Mpc\nassuming the \u039b cosmology or \u2248 65h\u22121Mpc assuming the\nEdS cosmology. This feature appears to reproduce in both\nthe NGC and SGC strips and in independent redshift bins\nbut its statistical significance is still marginal. An inves-\ntigation using CMBFAST indicates that the spike is seen\nat a \u223c>25 per cent smaller wavenumber than the second\npeak caused by acoustic oscillation in the pre-recombination\nbaryon-radiation fluid. Somewhat higher values of \u2126b than\nusually assumed in \u039bCDM models may also be needed to fit\nthe amplitude of the feature. It will be interesting to see if\nthis feature persists in the final 25k 2QZ survey P(k). Since\nit lies well into the linear regime where it will evolve little\nwith redshift under the correct assumed cosmology it could\ntherefore act as an important probe of world models.\nThe QSO power spectrum is currently measured to\nan accuracy of \u223c< 30% over the range of scales 60\u223c< r \u223c<\n200h\u22121Mpc for either the EdS or \u039b cosmology adopted\nhere. On these scales, we predict the errors will be approx-\nimately 1.5 times smaller in the completed 2QZ catalogue.\nThe power spectrum from the 25k catalogue will also be\nmeasurable out to scales of \u223c< 600h\n\u22121Mpc. Thus, when these\ndata become available, there is the promise of placing even\nstronger constraints on the large scale structure of the Uni-\nverse and hence on the underlying cosmological model.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to recognise the considerable efforts of all the\nAAT staff responsible for the operation of the 2dF instru-\nment which has made this survey possible.
