Yet the metabolome,\nbecause it is \u2018downstream\u2019, should show greater effects of\ngenetic or physiological changes and thus should be much\ncloser to the phenotype of the organism. We earlier presented a\nfunctional analysis strategy that used metabolic fingerprinting\nto reveal the phenotype of silent mutations of yeast genes1.\nHowever, this is difficult to scale up for high-throughput\nscreening. Here we present an alternative that has the required\nthroughput (2 min per sample). This \u2018metabolic footprinting\u2019\napproach recognizes the significance of \u2018overflow metabolism\u2019\nin appropriate media. Measuring intracellular metabolites is\ntime-consuming and subject to technical difficulties caused \nby the rapid turnover of intracellular metabolites and the need\nto quench metabolism and separate metabolites from the\nextracellular space. We therefore focused instead on direct,\nnoninvasive, mass spectrometric monitoring of extracellular\nmetabolites in spent culture medium. Metabolic footprinting\ncan distinguish between different physiological states of wild-\ntype yeast and between yeast single-gene deletion mutants\neven from related areas of metabolism. By using appropriate\nclustering and machine learning techniques, the latter \nbased on genetic programming2\u20138, we show that metabolic\nfootprinting is an effective method to classify \u2018unknown\u2019\nmutants by genetic defect.\nAfter optimization of electrospray ionization\u2013mass spectrometry\n(ESI-MS) parameters for the analysis of yeast minimal medium plus\na metabolite cocktail (see Supplementary Table 1 online), we ini-\ntially compared metabolic footprints from different growth phases\nof yeast batch culture. Visual inspection of the resulting mass spec-\ntra revealed that the metabolic footprint was characteristic of each\nspecific phase of culture growth (Fig. 1a). Footprints taken early,\nduring lag and early exponential phase, were comparatively simple,\nwith clear peaks for many of the exogenously supplied amino acids\nvisible against the background of the basal medium. The most\nmarked changes occurred across the transition from exponential to\nstationary phase, when the spectra became increasingly complex\nwith the appearance of numerous small peaks. This implies that the\ncells are secreting or excreting metabolites into the culture medium.\nAt the dilutions we used, and in these media, the normalized spectra\nwere qualitatively independent of the exact dilution over a broad\nrange. In particular, no new spectral peaks appeared as samples were\ndiluted (see Supplementary Fig. 1a,b online). In addition to visual\nanalysis of the resulting mass spectra, principal components analy-\nsis (PCA) was conducted on the preprocessed mass spectral data\n(see Methods). As a useful aid to multivariate data visualization,\nPCA seeks to rotate the data points into a new coordinate system,\nsuch that the majority of the variance in the data is accounted for in\nthe directions of a subset of these rotated axes. Hence, plotting the\npoints in this new coordinate system makes it easier to visualize the\nsignificant effects within the data. In the resulting PCA scores plot\n(Fig. 1b), data points are separated along a curve across the first two\nprincipal components (which account for some 98% of the vari-\nance) in a pattern that relates to the time of sampling (growth\nphase).\nUsing direct-injection MS alone, we could not unambiguously\nidentify unknown peaks in the metabolic footprint. However, it is\nimportant to note that metabolic footprinting was not devised as a\nmetabolite profiling strategy9, but instead relies on the development\nof rules to describe trends in the data that involve only a small num-\nber of the variables (masses)6. This type of pattern recognition\napproach10 then allows one to confine identification by tandem MS\nto those substances contributing to the rules, thus avoiding the\nnecessity for time-consuming identification of all metabolites in\nfirst-round analyses.\nWe next studied the robustness of the method with respect to\nvariances in conditions that might be anticipated. These included\nvariations in batches of medium, different inoculum levels and\ninoculation from different starter cultures, and the use of filter ster-\nilization as opposed to centrifugation for separating cells from\nmedium before MS analysis. In addition, we used strains in which\nthe kanMX deletion cassette had been inserted into the HO mating\nlocus\u2014a reportedly phenotypically neutral site11,12. We found that,\nin all cases, equivalent data points clustered together in a robust and\nreproducible manner; representative PCA plots are shown (Fig. 2).\n\u00a9\n20\n03\n N\nat\nur\ne \nPu\nbl\nis\nhi\nng\n G\nro\nu\np \n h\nttp\n:\/\/\nw\nw\nw.\nn\nat\nur\ne.\nco\nm\n\/n\nat\nur\neb\nio\nte\nch\nno\nlo\ngy\nL E T T E R S\nNATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY VOLUME 21 NUMBER 6 JUNE 2003 693\nYeast single-gene deletants with defects in amino acid metabolism\n(see Supplementary Table 2 online) generated by the EUROFAN\nproject (that is, carrying the kanMX resistance cassette in place of the\ntarget open reading frame) were compared. Wild-type yeast grown on\nfootprinting medium in batch culture exhausts available glucose\nbetween 12 and 14 h after inoculation, at which time the cell density,\nas measured by optical density, is sufficiently great to inhibit growth\nby respiration of the ethanol formed earlier, and optical density sub-\nsequently remains constant for many hours (Fig. 1). Consequently,\n24 h was chosen as both a biologically and technically convenient time\nfor taking samples. Microtiter-plate yeast cultures of deletant strains\nwere set up, and 24-h samples were processed and analyzed (see\nMethods). PCA conducted on the data gave good groupings of bio-\nlogical (culture) replicates (data not shown) but was not otherwise\nvery informative. Consequently, we applied discriminant function\nanalysis (DFA), a supervised technique that allows groups in the data\nto be defined1. Groups were assigned simply on the basis of (biologi-\ncal) replicate number, so that the analysis was not biased by precon-\nceived notions of how the footprint data should group according to\nour knowledge of the respective metabolic defect. By defining the\ngroups in this way, one is essentially informing the model that each\nstrain is different and thereby encouraging it to preserve those differ-\nences. Consequently, when strains do cluster together, this demon-\nstrates the presence of a real underlying biological relationship. In\naddition, cross-validation of the DFA model was done (see\nSupplementary Fig. 2 online). Each strain forms a distinct cluster,\nwith the exception of ho\u2206, which clusters together with the wild type.\nThis supports earlier conclusions11 from competition experiments in\nchemostat culture that the HO mating-type locus was a selectively\nneutral site for deletion cassette marker insertion and that the\nho::kanMX strain would therefore prove a suitable reference for func-\ntional analysis of EUROFAN deletants.\nThe EUROFAN systematic gene deletion project generated MATa\nand MAT\u03b1 haploid as well as homozygous and heterozygous diploid\nsingle-gene deletants for the purposes of large-scale functional analy-\nsis. Clearly, for essential genes, only heterozygous diploids are viable,\nso it was important to establish whether mutants could be distin-\nguished on the basis of their metabolic footprints regardless of their\nmating type. Footprints of MATa and MAT\u03b1 haploids and heterozy-\ngous diploid strains of three different gene deletion mutants (strains 1,\n3 and 5; Supplementary Table 2) plus wild type were compared. Data\nwere processed and analyzed as above. Replicates of the same gene\ndeletion (that is, all three mating types) were assigned to the same DFA\nclass. Mutants in genes from even nominally closely related areas of\nmetabolism (in this case, amino acid biosynthesis) may be distin-\nguished on the basis of their footprints, regardless of their mating type\n(see Supplementary Fig. 3 online).\nA common strategy in functional genomics is to carry out expres-\nsion profiling on a series of strains of known genotype and use the pat-\nterns to determine the \u2018closeness\u2019 to these expression profiles of genes\nof \u2018unknown\u2019 function. Such a strategy lies behind the FANCY\n(Functional ANalysis by Co-response in Yeast) method used previ-\nously for metabolic fingerprinting1, and when calibrated in this way is\nknown as \u2018supervised learning\u201910,13,14. To demonstrate the potential\napplication of metabolic footprinting as a \u2018guilt-by-association\u201915\nfunctional genomics strategy, we compared 24-h footprints from\nmicrotiter-plate cultures of 19 different deletion mutants with defects\nin a broad range of metabolic categories. Strain 18 (which carries a\ndeletion in ROX1, a heme-dependent transcriptional repressor of\nhypoxic genes) was very slow growing (see Supplementary Fig. 4\nonline) and had not reached stationary phase by the time of sampling;\nit was consequently omitted from further analyses. Two sets of very\nsimilar pairs of enzyme deletants were included in the strain set,\nincluding the pfk26\u2206 and pfk27\u2206 strains studied earlier1, so that we\nFigure 1  Metabolic footprinting of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Footprint\ndata from strains harboring the nit3 and pfk27 deletions clustered\nclosely together with strains carrying deletions in the related genes nit2\nand pfk26 (Fig. 3a,b). The cluster analysis relies on using just the most\nsignificant discriminant functions for its display in this way, and this\nconceals some of the complexity. To this end, we also carried out an\nagglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA; ref. 1) on the basis of\nall the discriminant functions used in the model (Fig. 3c). This shows\nclearly that the nit and pfk mutants do indeed group most closely with\neach other, and that in terms of the overall variance in the data in this\nfigure these genotypes were well distributed, with the nit knockouts\nlocated fairly near the center of the dendrogram and the pfk knockouts\nnear the edge in this multidimensional space (Fig. 3c). The dendro-\ngrams are based on data from all the samples and, as would be\nexpected, were consequently little affected by removal of individual\ngenotypes from the analysis (data not shown). In addition, the HCA\nshows that cki1\u2206 and faa3\u2206 knockouts group most closely with the\nwild-type ho\u2206.Note that they are indistinguishable from it in the two-\ndimensional DFA plot of Figure 3b. This is reasonable, because there is\nalmost certainly redundancy here\u2014that is, other related genes with\nthe same activities are present to provide equivalent functionality. In\naddition to CKI1 (YLR133W, specifying choline kinase), there is an\nethanolamine kinase gene EKI1 (YDR147W) whose product shows\ngreat similarity to choline kinase as determined from the MIPS data-\nbase (http:\/\/mips.gsf.de\/proj\/yeast\/CYGD\/db\/index.html). The prod-\nuct of FAA3 (YIL009W) (acyl CoA synthase) is 100-fold lower in\nactivity than is the product of FAA1 (YOR317W). FAA2 (YER015W)\nand FAA4 (YMR246W) are also closely related and probably arose\nfrom gene duplication of FAA1; indeed the Faa4 protein has 78% iden-\ntity to Faa3p and also has this acyl CoA synthase activity\n(http:\/\/mips.gsf.de\/proj\/yeast\/CYGD\/db\/index.html). This provides a\nuseful control experiment.\nAlthough the DFA strategy was highly successful, it was not very\ninformative as to which masses were important in the discrimination\nof the mutant classes. Rule-based methods\n(for example, refs. 14,16,17) are much more\ndescriptive but can be less accurate18. We\ntherefore used a variant of genetic program-\nming (gmax-bio; Aber Genomic Computing)\nto evolve a rule that could be used to give a\nsimple explanation of what best explained\nthe differences between the classes of inter-\nest. In the case of nitrilase, trained as in\nFigure 3, the rule \u201cIF normalized m\/z_201 >\n0.00126 THEN mutant = nitrilase\u2013\u201d cor-\nrectly identified all examples in training, val-\nidation and test sets with no false positives.\nThe continuing need for methods to ana-\nlyze complex biological systems with high\nthroughput and high information content\nhas led many researchers to measure expres-\nsion profiles at the level of the metabolome\nor \u2018metabolic fingerprint\u2019. We have here\ndemonstrated that the metabolic foot-\nprint\u2014the quota of low-molecular-weight\nmetabolites present in the extracellular\nmedium\u2014is rich in biochemical informa-\ntion, can be determined rapidly by direct-\ninjection MS, differs reproducibly between\nstrains and mutant types, and is thus a suit-\nable method for the purposes of functional genomics. Specific\nadvantages of footprinting over fingerprinting include its speed, ease\nof performance, the ability to automate it and the opportunity\u2014by\nidentifying the metabolites involved\u2014to establish the biochemical\nbasis for a defect. It is obvious that other spectrometric techniques\nmight be used as easily as MS, and that the formulation of the culture\nmedium might be varied to steer the analysis toward particular func-\ntional domains. Finally, because gene knockouts can be discrimi-\nnated reproducibly, it is reasonable that the same strategy might be\nused in assays of the mode of action of drugs19 or in the assessment\nof cytotoxicity20.\nMETHODS\nYeast strains. All method development was carried out with the wild-type\ndiploid strain BY4743 (MATa\/MAT\u03b1 ura3\u22060\/ura3\u22060 leu2\u22060\/leu2\u22060\nhis3\u22061\/his3\u22061 +\/lys2\u22060 met15\u22060\/+). Later comparisons with reference strains\ncarrying the kanMX resistance cassette (conferring resistance to geneticin\n(G418)) were done with both homozygous and heterozygous BY4743\nho::kanMX. Experiments with EUROFAN mutants were done with BY4741\nMATa haploid (ura3\u22060 leu2\u22060 his3\u22061 met15\u22060), in which single genes of inter-\nest had been replaced with the kanMX deletion cassette. Yeast cells were grown\nin synthetic defined minimal medium (0.67% Yeast Nitrogen Base without\nAmino Acids (Difco) (Supplementary Table 1 online), 2% dextrose) supple-\nmented with a metabolite cocktail of amino acids, bases and organic acids, all at\na final concentration of 1 mM.\nFlask culture. Batch cultures of 50 ml were inoculated with 500-\u00b5l washed\ninoculum from 5-ml starter cultures and grown in 250-ml flasks in a rotary\nshaker at 30 \u00b0C, 200 rpm.

For larger-scale comparison of metabolism\nmutants, microtiter plate batch cultures were used. 100-well Honeycomb II\nplates (Labsystems) were filled with 100 \u00b5l per well (ten replicate wells per\nstrain) of yeast cells diluted in fresh medium to a concentration of 5 \u00d7 105\ncells ml\u20131 from washed 5-ml starter cultures.

For flask cultures, 1-ml samples were removed at appro-\npriate points during culture growth and either centrifuged (8,000g, 10 min-\nutes) or filter-sterilized (through a prerinsed 0.2-\u00b5m Acrodisc filter, Gelman)\nto remove cells. The supernatant or filtrate was stored in 200-\u00b5l aliquots at\n\u201340 \u00b0C until later preparation for mass spectral analysis. For microtiter-plate\ncultures, 90 \u00b5l was removed at appropriate points during culture growth from\neach of three to eight adjacent replicate wells per strain and spun down; 85 \u00b5l\nof supernatant was removed and stored in microtiter plates at \u201340 \u00b0C until\nlater analysis.\nMass spectrometry and sample preparation. Before mass spectral analysis,\nsamples were diluted 10-fold in 30:70 (vol\/vol) methanol\/water. Formic\nacid was added to a final concentration of 0.1% (27 mM) to aid in the ion-\nization of amino acids. The samples were degassed and large particles were\nremoved by microcentrifugation (8,000g, 3\u20135 min). Mass spectra were\nobtained using a Micromass (Manchester, UK) LCT electrospray ionization\ntime-of-flight mass spectrometer. Collection of mass spectra was auto-\nmated by linking the MS to a Waters Alliance 2690 liquid chromatography\n(LC) system in which the HPLC column had been replaced with three m of\n0.13 mm internal diameter polyetheretherketone (PEEK) tubing21. Diluted,\ndegassed sample was dispensed in 200-\u00b5l aliquots into polypropylene\ninserts within HPLC vials (Waters). The vials were placed in the autosam-\npling carousels of the LC system, arranged in order of time of sampling and\nreplicate number. Using the MassLynx software (Micromass), the system\nwas set up as if for an automated LC-MS run: 20 \u00b5l of sample was automat-\nically injected into the sample loop and carried through the LC system in\n30:70 (vol\/vol) methanol with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 500 \u00b5l\/min.\nThe flow was split between LC and MS such that flow into the MS did not\nexceed 50 \u00b5l\/min. Spectra were collected in posi-\ntive ion mode every second (0.9-s scan time, 0.1-s\ninterscan delay) for 2 min per sample from m\/z\n65 to 1,000. A single 2-min run was performed\nfor each sample consecutively, with a 1-min\nintersample wash period, then this cycle was\nrepeated twice more to obtain three machine\nreplicates per sample. The ESI conditions were as\nfollows: capillary voltage 3,000 V, source temper-\nature 80 \u00b0C, desolvation temperature 120 \u00b0C, RF\nlens 100 V, sample cone voltage 30 V and extrac-\ntion cone voltage 10 V. Sample cone voltage,\nwhich determines the degree of fragmentation of\nthe analyte, was chosen such that the molecular\nions of a set of amino acids standards (histidine,\nleucine, lysine, methionine, tryptophan and\nuracil each at 100 \u00b5M) gave a clear peak at the\nexpected m\/z without excessive fragmentation.\nMS data preprocessing. The mass spectrometric\nmethods described above produce vast amounts of\npotentially useful data. Automated direct-injection\nMS, since it uses the LC system for automation,\nproduces a spectrochromatogram (an array of the\nmass spectra versus time) for each sample analyzed\nthat can typically hold 106 values (depending upon\nthe MS range and sampling rates). In their native\nform, such data are extremely difficult to interpret.\nTo convert the data into information of chemical or\nbiological interest, some sort of multivariate statis-\ntical analysis must be used. To simplify any subse-\nquent statistical analysis, two simple preprocessing\nalgorithms were applied to the direct-injection\nLC-MS spectrochromatograms. Each LC-MS array\nwas reduced into a single \u2018aggregate\u2019 MS vector by\nsumming the ion counts of a given m\/z ratio over the total scan cycle. Then each\nMS vector was \u2018binned\u2019 to unit m\/z ratio (that is, ion counts of fractional m\/z\nratios were added to the nearest integer m\/z). Thus, after this initial data reduc-\ntion, an MS spectrochromatogram with m\/z range 65 to 1,000 will be reduced\nto a single vector having 935 values.\nMultivariate data analysis. Before any multivariate analysis is carried out, each\nmass spectral vector is normalized to the total ion count for that vector, so that\ndifferent spectra can be compared quantitatively. Once a set of N spectra (with\nmass range p) is concatenated into a single matrix (N objects \u00d7 p variables),\neach column of the data set can be optionally normalized to unit variance. This\nis done to eliminate bias, in subsequent analysis, toward any column that con-\ntains either large absolute values or large variances22. Notably, however, nor-\nmalization (to unit variance) can sometimes be more detrimental than\nhelpful. If there are a large number of redundant variables in the data, the\nnoise affecting such variables is amplified to the same importance as relevant\nvariables, and this can easily cloud any underlying statistical trends.\nConsequently, in this instance scaling was not done before statistical analysis.\nTo reduce the dimensionality of the mass spectral data, PCA23 was used in the\nfirst stage of analysis (as described in ref. 1). PCA involves projecting the orig-\ninal X-matrix (N objects; p variables) onto a d-dimensional subspace using a\nprojection (or \u2018loading\u2019) matrix, thus creating object coordinates (a \u2018scores\u2019\nmatrix) in a new coordinate system. This is achieved by the method known as\nsingular value decomposition (SVD) of X:\nXN\u00d7p = UN\u00d7d\u039bd\u00d7dLTp\u00d7d = TN\u00d7dLTp\u00d7d\nwhere U is the unweighted (normalized) score matrix and T is the weighted (or\nbiased) score matrix. L is the loading matrix where the columns of L are known\nas eigenvectors or loading principal components.\u039b is a diagonal matrix (that is,\nall of the off-diagonal elements are equal to 0) containing the square roots of\nthe first d eigenvalues of the covariance matrix (XTX), where d < N and d < p.\nFigure 3 Metabolic footprinting may be used to classify strains on the basis of the deletion they carry.\nAn experiment was set up in which 24-h microtiter plate footprints of 19 different deletant strains with\na broad range of metabolic defects were compared. (a,b) Footprint data were used to train a DFA model\n(20 PCs, 99.6% of the variance).

In other words, the new coordinates\nare linear combinations of the original variables. For example, the elements of\nthe first principal component can be represented as:\nt11 = x11l11 + x12l21 +\u2026+ x1plp1\nt21 = x21l11 + x22l21 +\u2026+ x2plp1\n\u0001\ntn1 = xn1l11 + x12ln1 +\u2026+ xnplp1\nThe influence of each of the original variables on the new principal components\n(that is, the contents of the loading matrix) is determined on the basis of the max-\nimum variance criterion. The first principal component is considered to lie in the\ndirection describing maximum variance in the original data. Each subsequent\nprincipal component lies in an orthogonal direction of maximum variance that\nhas not been considered by the former components. The number of principal\ncomponents computed for a given data set is up to the analyst. However, usually\nas many principal components are calculated as are needed to explain a preset\npercentage of the total variance in the original data (the number of principal\ncomponents is always less than or equal to the number of original variables).\nThe second stage of the data analysis involves using DFA to separate the sam-\nples further into groups of replicates using the principal components calculated\nin stage 1 as the source data24,25. In contrast to PCA, DFA is a supervised\nmethod that allows groups in the data to be defined. All DFA classes were\ndefined only according to replicates of the same strain, such that the analysis\nwas unbiased by prior knowledge of how deletant strains might group accord-\ning to their underlying metabolic defect.\nFinally, the Euclidean distance between group centers in DFA space was used\nto construct a similarity measure, which was transformed into a dendrogram\nusing an agglomerative HCA26,27.\nMachine learning. We used the genetic programming software gmax-bio (Aber\nGenomic Computing). This takes data in the form described above, together\nwith knowledge of the target class it is desired to learn, and evolves rules which\neffect the necessary nonlinear mapping6,28.
