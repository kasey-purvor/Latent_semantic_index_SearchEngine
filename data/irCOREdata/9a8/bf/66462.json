In the simplest case, this involves determining stable Gaussian wavepacket solutions, and then\npropagating them using a cumulant-based formalism. We apply our method to the problem of quantum ac-\ncelerator modes, determining their relative longevity under different parameter regimes, and obtaining good\nqualitative agreement with exact wavefunction dynamics.\nPACS numbers: 03.65.Sq, 02.50.Cw, 05.45.Mt, 32.80.Lg\nSemiclassical approaches in quantum chaotic dynamics\nhave proved very successful in forging conceptual links be-\ntween classically chaotic systems and their quantum mechan-\nical counterparts [1]. When trying to include quantum me-\nchanical effects, an obvious step beyond point-particle dy-\nnamics is to consider the evolution of Gaussian wavepack-\nets. Straightforward semiclassical Gaussian wavepacket dy-\nnamics are limited in that, e.g., the wavepacket is unrealisti-\ncally forced to maintain its Gaussian form. Pioneering work\nby Huber, Heller, and Littlejohn [2] proposed remedying this\nby allowing complex classical trajectories. These also per-\nmit the study of a wider range of classically forbidden pro-\ncesses, and the propagation of superpositions of Gaussians.\nWe propose an alternative approach, which, most simply, is\nto follow the dynamics of the cumulants of initially Gaus-\nsian wavepackets. When taken to second order, the dynam-\nics are described purely in terms of means and variances, as\nin a Gaussian wavepacket, but evolution into non-Gaussian\nwavepackets is not proscribed. After developing the formal-\nism, we apply it to an exciting development in atom-optical\nstudies of quantum-nonlinear phenomena: quantum accelera-\ntor modes (QAM) [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Quantum accelerator\nmodes have proved to be a fascinating example of a robust\nquantum resonance effect, and the demonstrated coherence of\ntheir formation [6] promises important applications in coher-\nent atom optics [4, 10]. In a configuration consisting of a laser\ncooled cloud of freely falling cesium atoms subjected to peri-\nodic \u03b4-like kicks from a vertically oriented off-resonant laser\nstanding wave [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], QAM are characterized exper-\nimentally by a momentum transfer, linear with kick number,\nto a substantial fraction (up to \u223c 20%) of the initial cloud of\natoms. This system is also attractive in that it is possible to\ntune its effective classicality in an accessible regime far from\nthe true semiclassical limit, making it an ideal testing ground\nfor semiclassical theories. We use our approach to obtain in-\nsight into the relative longevity of QAM, and present very en-\ncouraging results on its utility.\nWe consider two conjugate self-adjoint operators: \u02c6\u03be and \u02c6\u03b6,\nsuch that [ \u02c6\u03be, \u02c6\u03b6] = i\u03b7, and a Hamiltonian \u02c6H( \u02c6\u03be, \u02c6\u03b6). The dynam-\nics of these operators can be fully described by the expectation\nvalues \u00b5\u03be = \u3008 \u02c6\u03be\u3009 and \u00b5\u03b6 = \u3008 \u02c6\u03b6\u3009 only as \u03b7 \u2192 0. In this limit there\nis a well-defined {\u03be, \u03b6} phase space, which generally consists\nof a mixture of stable islands based around stable periodic or-\nbits, and a chaotic sea. This is the case for our model example,\nthe \u03b4-kicked accelerator (see Fig. 1) [5].\nWhen considering dynamics near a stable periodic orbit in\nphase space, we use that: local dynamics approximate those of\na harmonic oscillator [11], and Gaussian wavepackets remain\nGaussian when experiencing harmonic dynamics. This moti-\nvates the initial use of a Gaussian ansatz of the form [2, 12]\n\u03c8(\u03be) =(2\u03c0\u03c32\u03be)\u22121\/4\n\u00d7 exp\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\u2212 [1 \u2212 i2\u03c3\n2\n\u03be\u03b6\/\u03b7][\u03be \u2212 \u00b5\u03be]2\n4\u03c32\n\u03be\n+\ni\u00b5\u03b6 [\u03be \u2212 \u00b5\u03be]\n\u03b7\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (1)\nwhere \u03c32\n\u03be\n= \u3008 \u02c6\u03be2\u3009 \u2212 \u3008 \u02c6\u03be\u30092 is the variance in \u02c6\u03be, and \u03c32\n\u03be\u03b6\n=\n\u3008 \u02c6\u03be \u02c6\u03b6 + \u02c6\u03b6 \u02c6\u03be\u3009\/2 \u2212 \u3008 \u02c6\u03be\u3009\u3008 \u02c6\u03b6\u3009 is the symmetrized covariance in \u02c6\u03be and\n\u02c6\u03b6. As Eq. (1) describes a minimum uncertainty wavepacket,\nthe \u02c6\u03b6 variance, \u03c32\u03b6 = \u3008 \u02c6\u03b62\u3009 \u2212 \u3008 \u02c6\u03b6\u30092, can be deduced from the\ngeneral uncertainty relation \u03c32\u03be\u03c3\n2\n\u03b6 \u2212 (\u03c32\u03be\u03b6)2 = \u03b72\/4 [this can\nbe seen from Eq. (1), using \u2212i\u03b7\u2202\/\u2202\u03be as the \u03be representation of\n\u02c6\u03b6]. If the stable islands around the periodic orbits of interest\nare significant compared to the size of a minumum uncertainty\nwavepacket, we find stable periodic orbits in {\u00b5\u03be , \u00b5\u03b6 , \u03c32\u03be , \u03c32\u03be\u03b6}\nwhen such a Gaussian ansatz is enforced. In reality this sta-\nbility is only approximate, but we will nevertheless utilize\nsuch solutions, as they are good estimates to maximally stable\nGaussian wavepackets.\nA complete picture of the observable dynamics can only be\ndetermined from the time-evolution of all possible expectation\nvalues of products of the dynamical variables. Except for very\nsimple systems, this produces a complicated hierarchy of cou-\npled equations. In order to gain any insight we must determine\na truncation scheme to reduce this to a managable description.\nThis is in a sense achieved by the Gaussian ansatz, which\nconsiders only means and variances. Means and variances\nare the first two orders of an infinite hierarchy of cumulants\n[13], which we denote by double angle brackets to distinguish\n2them from expectation values. The non-commutative cumu-\nlants can be obtained directly in terms of operator expectation\nvalues through [14]\n\u3008\u3008q\u02c61 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 q\u02c6n\u3009\u3009 = \u2202\n\u2202\u03c41\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2202\n\u2202\u03c4n\nln\u3008e\u03c41q\u02c61 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 e\u03c4nq\u02c6n\u3009|\u03c41=0,...,\u03c4n=0, (2)\nwhere q\u02c6i \u2208 { \u02c6\u03be, \u02c6\u03b6}.

Cumulants tend to\nbecome smaller with increasing order, unlike expectation val-\nues; intuitively, higher-order cumulants encode only an \u2018ex-\ntra bit\u2019 of information that lower-order cumulants have not\nyet provided. It is therefore often possible to provide a good\ndescription by systematically truncating, expressing moments\nof all orders in terms of cumulants up to some finite order\n[14]. Truncating at first order is equivalent to considering only\nmean values, and thus reproduces the corresponding Hamil-\nton\u2019s equations of motion. It is tempting to think that trun-\ncating at second order is equivalent to enforcing the Gaussian\nansatz. This will not in general reproduce the dynamics given\nby enforcing the Gaussian ansatz. Gaussian wavepacket dy-\nnamics are unitary, meaning that the uncertainty relation is\nalways exactly observed, and that one need consider only two\nof {\u03c32\n\u03be\n, \u03c32\n\u03b6\n, \u03c32\n\u03be\u03b6\n}. This is only true when no terms in the Hamil-\ntonian are of greater than quadratic order in { \u02c6\u03be, \u02c6\u03b6} [2]. Further-\nmore, finding a fixed point of {\u00b5\u03be , \u00b5\u03b6 , \u03c32\u03be , \u03c32\u03be\u03b6} is equivalent to\nfinding a perfectly Gaussian eigenstate of the system, which\nis only true for the harmonic oscillator.\nWhen propagating the second-order truncated equations of\nmotion for the first and second order cumulants, it is necessary\nto consider the dynamics of each of {\u03c32\u03be , \u03c32\u03b6 , \u03c32\u03be\u03b6} explicitly,\nas, unlike for the Gaussian ansatz [Eq. (1)], the uncertainty\nrelation is not hard-wired into the formalism. This implies\nthat the evolution described solely in terms of the first and\nsecond order cumulants is not unitary. This feature of our ap-\nproach more accurately reflects the fact that truncating gener-\nally leaves us with an incomplete description of the dynamics,\nwith a correspondingly inevitable loss of information about\nthe state of the system. We are also not restricted to initially\npure states, although this flexibility is not exploited here.\nNonetheless, when situated inside a stable island in {\u03be, \u03b6}\nphase space, such a \u2018stable\u2019 Gaussian wavepacket should be\nlong-lived due to the harmonic nature of the local dynam-\nics [15]. We then use the equations of motion appropriate to\nsecond-order cumulant dynamics to get an idea of how long-\nlived the initial wavepacket actually is, as physically sensible\nimperfections are included in the dynamics in a straightfor-\nward manner.\nThe approach we have described is most obviously applica-\nble in the standard semiclassical regime, but is not restricted\nto it. We will illustrate our method by applying it to a very in-\nteresting and experimentally relevant system, the quantum \u03b4-\nkicked accelerator [5], outside the semiclassical regime. Our\napproach provides useful insights on the longevity of QAM in\nthis system, essential for their possible application in coherent\natom optics [4, 10].\nThe dynamics of the atoms in the Oxford QAM experiment\n[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] are well modelled by the one-dimensional\n\u03b4-kicked accelerator Hamiltonian:\n\u02c6H =\np\u02c62\n2m\n+ mgz\u02c6 \u2212 ~\u03c6d[1 + cos(Gz\u02c6)]\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\u03b4 (t \u2212 nT ) . (4)\nHere z\u02c6 is the position, p\u02c6 the momentum, m the particle mass, g\nthe gravitational acceleration, t the time, T denotes the pulse\nperiod, G = 2\u03c0\/\u03bbspat where \u03bbspat is the spatial period of the\npotential applied to the atoms, and ~\u03c6d quantifies the depth of\nthis potential.\nThe near-fulfilment of the quantum resonance condition\n(closeness to particular resonant pulse periodicities [4, 9, 16])\nmeans the free evolution of a wavefunction, e.g., initially well\nlocalized in momentum and (periodic) position space imme-\ndiately after it experiences a kick, causes it to rephase to close\nto its initial condition just before each subsequent kick. The\ntreatment due to Fishman, Guarneri, and Rebuzzini accounts\nfor this in terms of a so-called \u01eb-classical limit [9], where a\nkind of kick-to-kick classical point dynamics is regained in\nthe limit of the pulse periodicity approaching integer mul-\ntiples of the half-Talbot time T1\/2 = 2\u03c0m\/~G2 [4], i.e., as\n\u01eb = 2\u03c0(T\/T1\/2 \u2212 \u2113) \u2192 0, where \u2113 \u2208 Z. This accurately ac-\ncounts for the observed acceleration for up to \u223c 100 kicks, as\nwell as predicting numerous experimentally observed high-\norder accelerator modes [7]. It is this \u01eb, whose smallness indi-\ncates nearness to special resonant kicking frequencies, leading\nto the production of QAM [9], and not ~, which takes the place\nof \u03b7 in our cumulant-based approach. We now sketch the treat-\nment of Refs. [9] to justify the appropriate phase-space which\nis the starting point of our analysis, providing enough detail\nfor the explanation to be self-contained.\nMoving to a frame comoving with the gravitational accel-\neration [ \u02c6U = exp(imgz\u02c6t\/~)], Eq. (4) transforms to:\nH =\n(\u03c1\u02c6 \u2212 \u03b3t\u02dc)2\n2\n\u2212 \u03ba(1 + cos \u03c7\u02c6)\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\u03b4\n(\nt\u02dc \u2212 n) . (5)\nWe have used scaled units: \u03c7\u02c6 = Gz\u02c6, \u03c1\u02c6 = GT p\u02c6\/m, and t\u02dc = t\/T .\nThe parameters are: the rescaled effect of gravity \u03b3 = gGT 2,\nand the stochasticity parameter \u03ba = ~\u03c6dG2T\/m = k\u03c6d, where\nk = ~G2T\/m = 2\u03c0T\/T1\/2 = \u2212i[\u03c7\u02c6, \u03c1\u02c6] is a rescaled Planck\nconstant. As the transformed Hamiltonian is spatially peri-\nodic, we parametrize the momentum in terms of the quasi-\nmomentum (in the lab frame, the initial quasimomentum) \u03b2,\ni.e., |\u03c1\u3009 = |(n + \u03b2)k\u3009, where n \u2208 Z and \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1).

Units are dimensionless.\nator ensuring that \u02c6Fn(\u03b2) acts on a subspace of one value of\n\u03b2 only, and the time-evolution of the transformed wavevec-\ntor |\u03c8\u3009 is given by |\u03c8(t\u02dc = n\u2032)\u3009 = \u220fn\u2032n=1 \u02c6Fn|\u03c8(0)\u3009.

(6)\nSubspaces of different \u03b2 are decoupled. A wavefunction con-\ntained within any such subspace is periodic, multiplied by a\nphase e\u2212i\u03b2\u03c7\u02c6, and can be equivalently represented by a rotor\nwavefunction [9]. We have therefore introduced the angle\nvariable \u02c6\u03b8 = \u03c7\u02c6mod(2\u03c0) and its discrete conjugate momentum\n\u02c6I (\u221d \u03c1\u02c6|\u01eb|\/k with a discrete spectrum of integer multiples of\n|\u01eb|), where [\u02c6\u03b8, \u02c6I] = i|\u01eb| and \u02dck = \u03ba|\u01eb|\/k = \u03c6d |\u01eb|.\nThe kick-to-kick Heisenberg map corresponding to the\ntime-evolution operator of Eq. (6) is given by\n\u02c6\u03b8n+1 =\u02c6\u03b8n + sgn(\u01eb) \u02c6Jn+1, (7a)\n\u02c6Jn+1 = \u02c6Jn \u2212 \u02dck sin \u02c6\u03b8n \u2212 sgn(\u01eb)\u03b3, (7b)\nwhere we have introduced \u02c6Jn = \u02c6In + sgn(\u01eb)[\u03c0\u2113 + k\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3(n \u2212\n1\/2)]. We thus reduce the dynamics of each of the decou-\npled \u03b2-rotor subspaces to a mapping [Eq. (7)] plus a sim-\nple transformation, where the overall dynamics can be recov-\nered by the superposition principle [9]. The general relation\n[ \u02c6\u03be, \u02c6\u03b6] = i\u03b7, which we is for this specific example replaced\nby [\u02c6\u03b8, \u02c6J] = i|\u01eb|. Quantum accelerator modes are explained\nby stable periodic orbits in the {\u03b8,J} phase space obtained\nby taking the pseudoclassical limit (|\u01eb| \u2192 0) [9], independent\nof what the phase space structure in the semiclassical limit\n(k \u2192 0) might be. We consider the originally discovered (1,0)\naccelerator modes around T = T1\/2 [3], corresponding to a\nfixed point of order 1 and jumping index 0 in the \u01eb-classical\nmapping produced by replacing the operators in Eq. (7) with\ntheir mean values [9].\nThe quantities we consider are the mean position \u03b8, the\nmean momentumJ , the position variance \u03c32, the momentum\nFIG. 2: (color online).

Enforcing\nthe Gaussian ansatz of Eq. (1) and implicitly assuming\n\u221a\n\u03c32\nto be small compared to 2\u03c0, the resulting kick-to-kick Gaus-\nsian mapping is given by\n\u03b8n+1 =\u03b8n + sgn(\u01eb)Jn+1, (8a)\nJn+1 =Jn \u2212 \u02dcke\u2212\u03c32n\/2 sin \u03b8n \u2212 sgn(\u01eb)\u03b3, (8b)\n\u03c32n+1 =\u03c3\n2\nn + 2sgn(\u01eb)(\u03a5n \u2212 \u02dcke\u2212\u03c3\n2\nn\/2\u03c32n cos \u03b8n)\n+ [2(\u03a5n \u2212 \u02dcke\u2212\u03c32n\/2\u03c32n cos \u03b8n)2 + \u01eb2]\/4\u03c32n, (8c)\n\u03a5n+1 =\u03a5n \u2212 \u02dcke\u2212\u03c32n\/2\u03c32n cos \u03b8n\n+ sgn(\u01eb)[2(\u03a5n \u2212 \u02dcke\u2212\u03c32n\/2\u03c32n cos \u03b8n)2 + \u01eb2]\/4\u03c32n, (8d)\nwhere S 2\nn+1 can be deduced from \u03c3\n2\nn+1S\n2\nn+1 \u2212\u03a52n+1 = \u01eb2\/4. In\nour search for \u2018stable\u2019 Gaussian wavepackets, we search for\nsolutions extending the conditions \u03b8n+1 = \u03b8n and Jn+1 = Jn,\nappropriate to an \u01eb-classical fixed point, to \u03c32\nn+1 = \u03c3\n2\nn, S 2n+1 =\nS 2n and \u03a5n+1 = \u03a5n. A Gaussian solution is thus dependent on\n\u01eb as well as \u02dck and \u03b3. We consider situations which correspond\nexperimentally to freely varying the kicking periodicity and\nthe laser intensity, with \u03b3 = gGT 2 determined by T = (\u01eb +\n2\u03c0)T1\/2\/2\u03c0, g = 9.8 ms\u22122, and G = 2\u03c0\/(447 nm). Wigner\nrepresentations [13] of such \u2018stable\u2019 Gaussian wavepackets,\noverlaid by Poincare\u00b4 sections of the \u01eb-classical phase space\n[9], are shown in Fig. 1. We see that the Wigner functions\nclosely match the shape of the stable island.\n4~\n-2 -1 0 1 2\n\u03b5\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nk\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nFIG. 3: (color online).

(9e)\nThis mapping has no fixed points. In Fig. 2, we display the\ntime for which the center of mass momentum remains inside\nits initial phase space cell (|Jn| < \u03c0), using this as a rule-\nof-thumb measure of relative longevity (for a genuine fixed\npoint this would be forever). We see that there is a sizable\nregion where there there are no stable Gaussian fixed points, in\naddition to the region where there are no \u01eb-classical solutions,\nand that QAM for \u01eb < 0 are generally more long-lived. These\nobservations are broadly born out by experiment [3].\nWe have also computed for how long |Jn| < \u03c0 when inte-\ngrating the exact evolution described by Eq. (6) [5]. The com-\nputationally more convenient I representation of the initial\nstate determined by Eqs. (8a)\u2013(8d) is then |\u03c8\u3009 \u221d \u2211\u221en=\u2212\u221e cn|I =\nn|\u01eb|\u3009, where [17]\ncn =\n[\n\u03c32\n2\u03c0(\u01eb2\/4 + \u03a52)\n]1\/4\n\u00d7 exp\n(\n\u2212\u03c3\n2\/\u01eb2[n|\u01eb| \u2212 I0]2\n1 \u2212 i2\u03a5\/|\u01eb| \u2212\ni\u03b80[n|\u01eb| \u2212 I0]\n|\u01eb|\n)\n.\n(10)\nThis corresponds to a spatially periodic train of shifted Gaus-\nsians. Figure 3 shows the results of these integrations. We see\nthat Fig. 2 reproduces its qualitative features quite well, es-\npecially for smaller values of \u01eb and \u02dck. More surprising is the\nreplication of a saddle-point feature at around {\u01eb = \u22121.5, \u02dck =\n2}, indicating a resurgence of stability for large \u01eb that is clearly\nnot an artefact of our approximations.\nIn conclusion, we have developed a general method for\nusing second order cumulants to study semiclassical-like\ndynamics near stable periodic orbits in phase space. We\nhave successfully applied this method to quantum accelerator\nmode dynamics, which operate in an unusual \u01eb-semiclassical\nregime, thus gaining insight into the longevity of quantum ac-\ncelerator modes in different parameter regimes.\nWe thank R.M.
