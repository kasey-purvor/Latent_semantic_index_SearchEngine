It refers to the traditional responsibility of women in mining \nlocalities for the maintenance of neighbourhood and kin relations and \nusing the example of a key  activist in one ex-mining village, it argues \nthat  the values associated with \u2018mining community\u2019 remain relevant as \na reference point for a self-conscious, politicised reshaping of local \nrelationships in post-industrial conditions. The material basis for this \nself-conscious approach has shifted from the masculine sphere of \nmining work and its associated community institutions to the feminised \nsphere of location and neighbourhood.  \n \nKeywords:  Women, Miners\u201f Strike, Community, Neighbourhood, Kinship. \n \nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 : \n \nCet article examine l\u2019h\u00e9ritage du militantisme des femmes du Nord-Est de \nl\u2019Angleterre qui se sont organis\u00e9es pour soutenir la gr\u00e8ve des mineurs de 1984-1985 \net qui ont continu\u00e9 leur action depuis.  Il prend comme point de d\u00e9part la \nresponsabilit\u00e9 traditionnelle qu\u2019ont les femmes dans les localit\u00e9s mini\u00e8res pour \nle maintien des relations de voisinage et de famille, et il se sert de l\u2019exemple d\u2019une \nmilitante qui a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le de premier plan dans une ancienne agglom\u00e9ration mini\u00e8re \npour soutenir la th\u00e8se que les valeurs associ\u00e9es \u00e0 la \u00ab communaut\u00e9 mini\u00e8re \u00bb restent \npertinentes comme point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour la restructuration consciente et politis\u00e9e \ndes relations locales dans des conditions post-industrielles.  La base sociale de  cette \napproche consciente s\u2019est d\u00e9plac\u00e9e du domaine masculin du travail \u00e0 la mine et de ses \n 2 \ninstitutions communautaires associ\u00e9es pour se centrer d\u00e9sormais sur le domaine \nf\u00e9minis\u00e9 de l\u2019agglom\u00e9ration et du voisinage.  \n \n \nIn a radio interview commemorating the 20th anniversary of the 1984-5 Miners\u201f \nStrike, a leading figure in the Women Against Pit Closures movement (WAPC) \ncommented that women had always formed the backbone of mining \ncommunities (BBC Radio Newcastle, 9th March 2004). In addition to the \ntraditional domestic role associated with miners\u201f wives (Dennis et al, 1956; \nBulmer, 1975; Waddington et al, 1991), the female contribution has included \nparticipation in neighbourhood activities which have linked with significant \nmoments of industrial action, including the 1926 lockout (Williamson, 1982) \nand the 1984-5 strike (Rowbotham and McCrindle, 1986; Samuel et al 1986; \nSeddon, 1986; Allen, 2001).  Since the pioneering historical work of Sheila \nRowbotham (1973) recorded the extent to which female participation in labour \nstruggles have tended to be submerged in subsequent accounts, feminist \nresearchers have endeavoured to ensure that the activities of women in \nstruggle are not \u201ehidden from history\u201f.  They have done so partly by revealing \nand re-evaluating the significance of their campaigning work (e.g. Measham \nand Allen, 1994; Beckwith, 1998; Allen, 2001).  This article is conceived within \nthis process in relation to the miners\u201f strike of 1984-1985. However, rather \nthan reflecting on the strike itself, we consider the manner in which the values \nmobilised by women in its support, particularly in relation to loosely defined \nideas about \u201emining community\u201f, are now used informally by them to inform \ntheir activism in post-industrial conditions.  \n \n 3 \n\u201eCommunity\u201f as a set of ideals denoting reciprocity, co-operation, and \nmutuality, has long been associated with mining life and related to trade union \nand party politics in the public sphere. This was expressed powerfully in the \nsolidarity and comradeship amongst those who remained on strike throughout \n1984-5 (Beynon, 1985; Samuel et al, 1986). These ideals have also been \nevident within everyday life revolving around the more private spheres of \nhome, family and neighbourhood.  In this arena, ways of living, though \ndependent upon mining itself, nevertheless developed with a degree of \nautonomy consequent upon the highly differentiated gender positions \ncharacteristic of mining societies (Dennis et al, 1956; Waddington et al, 1991).  \nThe experience and memories of ways of life associated with mining are \ninfused with gender difference. Continuing, self conscious commitment to the \nvalues espoused during the strike are therefore articulated through gendered \nlocations, expectations and negotiations, but these  have not remained static \nin the twenty years since the strike.  \n \nIn this exploratory piece, we pursue a number of themes related to women\u201fs \nactivism in the post-mining context with reference to traditional gender roles \nand representations. In so doing we utilise the notion of \u201ecommunity\u201f as a fluid \nconcept which is being adapted in the actual lived relationships of the women.  \nModels of community as relationships of \u201eplace\u201f and of \u201einterest\u201f (Bell and \nNewby, 1971) are a useful starting point in understanding the significance of \ndifferentiated gender positions within the context of mining, but we suggest \nthat with the destruction of the industry, \u201ecommunity\u201f has taken on a set of \nextended meanings about a way to live which draws from the collective \n 4 \npolitics associated with the strike, but is developing out of the traditional \nfemale responsibilities for family and neighbourhood.  \n \nOur explorations raise questions about common sense views of women and \nmining community, which linger particularly in narratives of their actions in the \n1984-5 strike.    \n \n \nThe Post Mining Context \nAccording to the Task Force Report for the Office of the Deputy Prime \nMinister, \u201ePit closures have dealt a sudden and irreversible shock to the \nculture of coal field communities\u201f (ODPM, 1998:31). This \u201eshock\u201f has a gender \ndimension. Formerly, links between work and neighbourhood, industrial and \nsocial relations had been inscribed within the public institutions of local life \n(Dennis et al, 1956; Williamson, 1982; Thew, 1985).  These institutions, \nconcerned with recreation, education, welfare and housing for miners and \ntheir families were sponsored and organised primarily by men through \norganisations associated with the nationalised industry and the miners\u201f union \n(Waddington et al, 1991). For example, it has been suggested that during the \n1950s, Britain had more than 200 youth clubs functioning under miners\u201f \nwelfare services, which have since disappeared (White, 2004:16).  As one of \nour principal informants for this paper asserted:  \n\u2026most of the facilities in a mining village were provided either by the \nMiners\u2019 Union or the Coal Board. Like, the Church Institute was run by \nCISWO which is the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation, the \n 5 \ncricket club came as part of CISWO. The Community Centres- the \nChurch Institute is a community centre now as is the old school. But \nthere was a Workers\u2019 Educational Library here and all sorts, so there \nwas no need to be travelling outside of the community. Your Club was \npredominantly with miners in charge you know. We all know about the \nCommittee!  (Jean1 Interview)\n \n\u201eThe Committee\u201f represented the local political control by men of the material  \nresources in civil society which expressed the cohesion of \u201emining \ncommunity\u201f.  This control has been seriously wounded by the collapse of \nmining-related facilities.  Pit closures and related socio-economic decline have \nbeen accompanied by weakening and fragmentation of the masculine \norganisational framework in which local cultural norms, with their \ngemeinschaft  characteristics (T\u00f6nnies, 1955; Bauman, 2001) were previously \nreproduced in the public domain. Inevitably, the loss of work  and the \ndestruction of associated systems of socialisation, power and cultural \nreproduction have been accompanied, as predicted (Samuel et al, 1986), by \nan  increase in the range of problems associated with low income, insecurity \nand decreased levels of civic participation (Putnam, 2001; Waddington, 2003).  \nIn degraded environments, where the identifying adjective \u201emining\u201f no longer \nhas a material reference point, it has been difficult to sustain \u201ecommunity\u201f \nderived from connections between work and place with  assumptions of \ncollective endeavour reflecting patterns of male work underground. As place \nof residence and rhythms of life cease to revolve around the mine, the family \nand neighbourhood base of women\u201fs traditional role in community is also \n 6 \ndisturbed. Meanwhile, young people have no visible reference point for \ninheriting a common culture located in local community life and relationships.  \n \nA range of studies have considered the implications for gender roles both of \nthe women\u201fs activism during the strike and of the process of de-\nindustrialisation since. For example, in 1991, Waddington et al suggested that \ndespite the activism of women, the effects of the strike upon gender relations \nhad been small scale and muted. They observed some \u201esoftening of the rough \nedges of masculine behaviour\u201f, but argued that that the principle determinant \nof changing gender roles devolved around opportunities for female \nemployment.  By 1996, Dicks was exploring the increased dependence on \nwomen\u201fs employment outside the home in ex-mining areas, and arguing that \nthe domestic division of labour had become a primary site of struggle.  Dicks \net al (1998) suggested that women were carrying the burden of male \njoblessness through their continuing role as family carers.  Extending this \ntheme, Strangleman (2001) noted the significance to family stability of \nintergenerational relationships and support in circumstances where women\u201fs \nwages have become important to family income. Recently, Waddington (2003; \n2005) has described important roles played by local and professional women \nin a decade of struggle for regeneration in one ex-mining locality.  Women \nhave clearly entered more fully into the public arena, principally through work. \nNevertheless, there is no clear evidence that in this process they have lost \ntheir responsibility for the maintenance of family and neighbourhood. Indeed, \nit appears rather that these two areas of concern are becoming more fully \n 7 \nintertwined in women\u201fs lives and that women are now taking greater \nresponsibility for the institutional infrastructure of local community life.  \n \nDespite the pessimistic prognosis for the future of mining in Britain in the \nimmediate aftermath of the strike, some commentators retained a hope that \nthe collective values deployed in its support might be sustained in post-strike \nconditions (Beynon, 1985; Samuel et al 1996).  By the end of the 1980s that \nhope was receding (Waddington et al. 1991). Collectively organised facilities, \nsuch as public kitchens and cr\u00e8ches were closed and activist women \nretreated into their families to deal with the personal consequences of struggle \nand defeat (Shaw, 1993). As the institutions which publicly signified the \nmasculine collective culture and values of \u201emining community\u201f were weakened \nor dismantled, nothing replaced them. Yet Waddington\u201fs recent study of \nWarsop Vale (2003; 2005) offers grounds for hoping that the long term \nsituation is not quite as bleak as previously perceived. Locally based action \nbased on alliances between residents and professional workers with a \ncommunity brief, has begun to make a difference to conditions in one \nstruggling ex-mining village. Here it seems that among the men and women \nmost dedicated to the community-building process, personal identification with \nmining life has meshed with a desire to rebuild \u201ecommunity\u201f in terms which \nfocused upon homes, children and neighbourhood .    \n \nOutside the mining context, it has been noted how residents living in run-down \nhousing estates use the notion of \u201evillage\u201f to (re) generate a sense of \nownership and belonging amongst local people, despite the absence of a \n 8 \ncommon employment base (Garner and Clarke, 2005). This implies that \nprivate beliefs and energies which mobilise widely used, loosely defined, \nidealised concepts such as \u201evillage\u201f, can be effective at the level of \nneighbourhood in stimulating co-operative endeavour. Where the local history \nis one of mining, \u201evillage\u201f is frequently a real entity. Even where it is not, as the \nsuccesses of community work imply (Popple, 1995; Waddington, 2003; 2005), \nthe shared interests of residents in the welfare of local neighbourhoods can \nbe mobilised as a material foundation for collective action using the medium \nof \u201efeel-good\u201f concepts like \u201evillage\u201f or \u201ecommunity\u201f. In the ex-mining locality, a \ntraditional feminised understanding of everyday networks and relationships \ncan be particularly significant in pursuing collective ideals which are not \ndeterministically dependent upon waged employment.   \n \nThe Research  \nThe research data upon which this article is based, derives primarily from \nsemi-structured interviews with nine women who were active in the strike, and \nfrom a focus group discussion in with a group of women in an ex-mining \nvillage in Co. Durham who are involved in a Savings Group facilitated by one \nof the interviewees. These two sets of data collected between 2002 and 2004 \nare part of a wider research project and discussion group concerned with \nwomen and mining in the north east. Members of the group have been \ninvolved personally in women\u201fs activism in relation to mining, both in the strike \nand in the 1992-3 campaign against pit closures and have subsequently \nreflected upon and written about those experiences (eg. Shaw, 1993; Spence, \n1998; Suddick, 2005).   \n 9 \n \nThe nine interviewees are a subset of 32 women who were affiliated to WAPC \nand mining support groups during the strike who were interviewed by Shaw \nbetween 1985 and 1987.  The purpose of revisiting these women was to \nconsider the longer term consequences of the strike. Within the interviews, \nmemories of the strike provided a starting point for narratives which tended \ntowards the auto-biographical as the women assessed its place in the overall \ntrajectories of their lives.  From these biographies we have chosen one in \nparticular, the story of Jean, to raise a number of questions for further \nexploration.   \n \nThe interview transcripts reveal that the experience of the strike created a \nbroad understanding amongst the women in which the solidaristic collective \naction associated with trade union and labour politics was merged with female \nresponsibilities for family and neighbourhood through the discourse of mining \ncommunity. This has been taken by the women into their post-strike \nenvironment and used as a value framework for continuing, individual \nactivism. The focus group discussion was designed to interrogate the \nsignificance of this, and to assess whether the values associated with \nwomen\u201fs responsibilities in relation to mining were being reproduced in the \ncontemporary environment. Three of the women in the focus group were \ninvolved in the miners\u201f strike. This includes Jean who is especially self \nconscious about the relationship between the strike and her own community \nactivism and has engaged in discussions with the research team about these \nissues outside the research environment. The other three were younger and \n 10 \nhad no memory of mining in the locality.  The interest in individual biographies \nwas continued within the focus group but also extended to questions about \nwhether different, individual life histories combined to form a collective \nunderstanding related to ideas about mining community.   \n \n \n \n \nCommunity  \nIt has been suggested that although the conditions of the strike propelled \nthose involved into recreating in actuality the conditions of solidarity and \nreciprocity associated with traditional mining community, collective provision \nin the public sphere was much less important than the private ties of kinship in \nsustaining people through the twelve months of hardship and struggle \n(Samuel et al, 1986:9). This prefigures Strangleman\u201fs argument (2001) that \nextended family networks have been central to the processes of transition \nsince the traumas of pit closures. The relevance of this argument is \nunderlined by the fact of decline of \u201emining communities\u201f as real places.  Even \nby 1984, \u201emining community\u201f was more a memory or an imagined place in \nmany coalfield localities (Waddington, 2005). In the village where the savings \ngroup organises, the mine had closed in 1975 and at the time of the strike \nthose employed in mining were a small minority, travelling over 15 miles to the \nlarger coastal pits for their work.  Nevertheless, the notion of belonging to a \ncommunity linked with mining has persisted both here and for the women \ninterviewed in other locations across the region. The data reveals a continuing \n 11 \nand long-term concern with community as an issue and our analysis suggests \nthat from the perspective of the women, there is no absolute distinction \nbetween responsibilities for kin or for community, that the two merge in female \nactivism.  \n \nIdeas about \u201emining community\u201f as a \u201eway to live\u201f as well as a \u201eway of life\u201f \ninformed female organisation and were acted out in women\u201fs mobilisation \nduring the strike.  However, this was not unique to the strike. Rather its \nsignificance was emphasised by the dispute. The research material questions \nthe common sense understanding that pre-existing, traditionally feminised, \npersonal skills were \u201epoliticised\u201f during the dispute. In contrast it appears that \nfor some women such skills were always used within the political landscape of \ntheir lives which included formal party political and trade union activism as \nwell as neighbourhood and community duties. The strike was so powerful for \nthem, not just because it created an opportunity for intense political \nengagement, not only because it \u201epoliticised\u201f them, but because it legitimated \nthe personal in the political and brought to visibility in the public sphere their \nintermeshed interests of family, community and waged work. \n  \nThe strike was undoubtedly a defining moment for all the women in the \nresearch in terms of their self-consciousness about class and gender \npositions and relations with wider political structures.  Yet subsequent \nactivism cannot be simply \u201eread off\u201f from it.  A number of different personal \ntrajectories followed in the wake of the strike including personal education and \ndevelopment, access to professional careers, increased formal political \n 12 \nengagement and non-party political activism. The nature of our research \nmeant that it was inevitable that the nine interviewees were those most likely \nto have remained publicly engaged, but what could not be predicted was their \ncontinuing commitment to an ideal of community activism focused on the \ntraditional female location in neighbourhood.  Amongst those who were \ninvolved in party politics, one had attained the position of mayor in a major \ncity, but generally, insofar as they sought public office, the women expressed \na preference for the role of parish councillor which keeps them personally in \ntouch with neighbourhood issues: \nI\u2019m in the Labour Party and I am a Parish Councillor.  I could have \nbeen a District Councillor but I mean I never put in for it because I like \nthe Parish.  I think when you cover your Parish \u2013 well I have a friend \nwas a County Councillor and she found that it took her away from the \npeople (Ethel, interview).     \n \nParish councillors and neighbourhood activists draw upon a long tradition of \nworking class female \u201eself-help\u201f, \u201egood neighbourliness\u201f and informal \neducation which can be traced in other contexts (Reynolds, 2003). These \nmade an important, if not the only contribution to survival during the strike. \nThey have continued since as a \u201epolitics of the doorstep\u201f: \nIf you can\u2019t see to your own, you can\u2019t see to anybody else\u2019s. And I \nthink people come to me because they know I wouldn\u2019t repeat \nanything. It\u2019s all confidential you know. I mean when they come to my \ndoor and I bring them in, I lock the door to make sure we are not \ndisturbed. I will say to them, \u2018 Look, I\u2019ve got to ask you some personal \n 13 \nquestions. We can\u2019t sort this out unless you tell us the truth. Now if \nyou\u2019ve missed a payment, I want to know. I\u2019ve been in that \nsituation\u2019\u2026I\u2019ve stopped going to the club because it was getting,  \u2018Have \nyou got a minute?\u2019 you know.  And it was taking three quarters of an \nhour before I could get a drink!\u2026But I really enjoy it. It\u2019s lovely you \nknow to walk through the village and \u2018Hiya!, Hello there\u2019 you know. \n(Freda,  Interview).  \n \nThe maintenance of the collective ideals associated with mining community in \nsuch an approach is to a large extent dependent upon the commitment to a \nset of explicit values maintained by the individual activist who frequently \nbecomes a catalyst for community building. The ideals are realised in practice \nthrough interpersonal processes of reciprocity which cement \u201ecommunity\u201f as a \nlived reality for them. Some individuals make extraordinary contributions to \nthe maintenance of collective approaches within social groups and this is \napparent, but takes different forms both in the workplace (Darlington, 2001; \n2002) and in civil society.  In north east England, the social contribution of \nminers associated with trade unionism and labour politics, such as Thomas \nHepburn,2 Peter Lee,3 and Sam Watson4, are legendary. Yet individual \nactivism does not necessarily follow from the experience of working conditions \nin the mine or the social conditions of mining localities. Many miners who \nexperienced the interdependence of the workplace and of neighbourhood \nfailed to draw from this a commitment to collective well-being. Those who \nbroke the 1984-5 strike symbolised the limits of collective solidarity compared \nwith individual interest.  Similarly, not every woman associated with mining \n 14 \nhas contributed positively to the cohesion of neighbourhood. There is an \nimplicit understanding within the labour movement that to some extent, the \nmaintenance of the collective consciousness which underpins trade union \nsolidarity and politicises worker co-operation depends upon social and \npolitical education and understanding. Whilst the history of mining is littered \nwith the male leaders of struggle who have paid detailed attention to the \ntransmission of collective ideals and values, scant attention, with the notable \nexception of Waddington (2005), has been afforded to the significance of \nindividual women in this process.  \n \nIn this context, we focus on one particular woman, Jean, as an example of a \nreflexive individual acting self-consciously and purposefully towards the \nmaintenance of ideals associated with mining community as articulated during \nthe strike. Jean has not been chosen as \u201erepresentative\u201f but rather because \nher voice has been evident in each stage of the research, and because she is \nacknowledged by the other women, nationally as well as locally, to be \narticulate in communicating their subjective understanding of the meaning of \nthe strike (Newcastle, 2004).  The transcript of the savings group discussion \nhighlights the manner in which ideas about collective responsibility derived \nfrom mining life and politics are promoted in Jean\u201fs contemporary activism \nand local relationships. In particular, it is apparent that she seeks to cement \n\u201ebonding\u201f networks which sustain local activity based upon the traditional \nresponsibilities of women for neighbourhood. At the same time, she works to \nextend and to inter-marry these with \u201ebridging\u201f activities, maintaining her \n 15 \ncontacts with the NUM, with other women activists outside the region, and \nwith international contacts in the labour movement  (Putnam, 2001).   \n \nJean  \nJean is a single woman in her 50s.  She has no waged employment but works \nlong hours to support friends and neighbours and to organise local and \nnational events concerned with mining issues.  She was born and brought up \nin a West Durham mining village, although her father was not a miner.  At the \noutbreak of the strike Jean was employed as a secretary by the miners\u201f \nMechanics Union and thus inevitably was caught up in strike politics, though \nshe claims not to have been a \u201epolitical animal\u201f in 1984.   However, her \nengagement was also personal. Her sister, a miner\u201fs wife, had recently died, \nleaving a young child and a baby. Her brother-in-law was on strike. The \nimmediate pull was the practical needs of those around her, \u201eI just had to get \ninvolved I had to do something!\u2019  Jean had previously had some involvement \nin local, community based activity and she drew upon this experience to \nshape her political activism during the strike. \n \nThroughout 1984-5, she developed a public persona, co-ordinating the \ndistribution of food parcels, organising fund-raising and related events, \nspeaking at meetings and to the media. During this process, as happened to \nso many people involved in the strike, her understanding of political structures \nand inequalities became much more explicit (Coulter et al, 1984; Parker, \n1986).  Nevertheless, she held fast to her personal approach to politics:  \n 16 \nThat\u2019s the battle I had right the way through the year. At the end of the \nday I had to keep sitting down and working out why I was doing this \nand going back to my sister, to her husband and to the two kids (Jean, \nInterview). \n \nJean is now a catalyst for informal, voluntary community action in her village.  \nShe uses her home, her personal knowledge, her extensive network of \ncontacts in politics and higher education built up during and since the strike, \nand her access to the Internet as resources for problem solving, collective \nlocal action and wider networking.  From her small mining cottage, which is \nalways \u201eopen for visitors\u201f, who \u201ejust call in for a cup of tea\u201f, she runs what is \nlocally (and laughingly) called either \u201eThe Office\u201f or (for women), \u201eThe Stress \nClinic\u201f.   \n \nJean\u201fs local importance was emphasised by members of the savings group:  \nAngela\u2026. you do get a wider spectrum of friends just by knowing Jean, \nbecause she knows everybody (laughter). She makes you feel so at \nease and so welcome. \nHazel...I mean if you go to her house you have got to be up there by \nhalf past eight or you don\u2019t get a seat. You know what I mean?  \n(general laughter) \nLaura...The kettle is never off, the electric bill must be sky high! \nJean \u2026 It\u2019s just tea and coffee. \nHazel... I know if anybody has got a problem, it\u2019s always Jean they go \nto. \n 17 \n(Savings group discussion) \n \nJean\u201fs home combines private and public, bringing public troubles into her \nprivate world. As a home, her house is a place of friendship lived as kinship. \nAs an office it is a place of politicised communication and community work.   \nRoles and relationships are inextricably meshed.  Neighbours and friends call \nin to discuss personal and financial problems; young people receive advice \nabout homework; projects and campaigns are initiated there; at Christmas, \nshe cooks for those who would otherwise be on their own. Through \u201ethe \noffice\u201f, Jean has supported friends at industrial tribunals and appealed against \nadverse benefit decisions.  As an individual she has replaced a type of service \nwhich was once provided by NUM officials (Samuel et al, 1986) offering \ninformation and advice, intervening in relation to welfare and housing \nproblems and helping to complete official forms from a position which makes \nno claim to be \u201eneutral\u201f.  Jean takes sides in a manner which signifies the \ncontinuing salience of class inequality and identity in local lives.  \n \nWhilst it could be argued that her work is indicative of a (feminised) \nindividualisation which has replaced collectivised services based upon \n(masculinist) trade unionism, there is an emphasis on reciprocity, mutuality \nand collectivity in Jean\u201fs approach which she relates to her understanding of \nsocialism.  She is aware that she could take individual political advantage of \nthe personal power generated by the use of her skills and resources, but \nchooses not to do so:  \n 18 \nIt\u2019s tempting all these things, but with power comes a lot of \u2026My \npolitics begin and end with a sort of \u2013 this is going to sound really \nponcy- a spiritual socialism. I want socialism because it will be good for \npeople. I don\u2019t want socialism because it would give me a position. And \nI want people to understand why they should be socialist- I don\u2019t want \nto dictate to them (Jean, interview). \n \nThe home\/office is a place where reciprocal \u201ecommunity-creating\u201f relations are \nlived. Jean is repaid in kind for her services to others. Sometimes people \nbring her presents: \u201eHe brought me a trout! Not that I expect anything for \nhelping him\u201f. Often this is based upon the trust which she earned during the \nstrike: \u201eJohn came around and fixed up my computer so now I am on the \nInternet.  He said he would never forget what I did for him in the strike.\u201f  \nJean\u201fs approach is grounded in the friendship she gives and receives in the \nprivate sphere and this has implications for public life in the village and the \npossibilities for relations lived actively as \u201ecommunity\u201f.  \n \nBeyond \u201ethe office\u201f and from it, Jean helps to organise events and activities \nwhere the reference point is \u201emining community\u201f.  Although this is grounded in \nthe local historical experience of mining, it also uses the national and \ninternational networks and links generated over time through internationalism \nwithin trade unionism, specifically in the NUM, and within socialist \norganisations. Jean is particularly focused upon the memory of mining and its \ntraditions and in educating children about mining life and values.  She has \nhelped to organise local exhibitions about mining, is involved in moves to \n 19 \nrestore the local NUM Lodge Banner and is the motivating force behind the \ncreation of a WAPC web site (wapc.org.uk). She continues to speak about the \nstrike and links this to contemporary concerns at public events on a local and \nnational stage. She writes for socialist publications and nurtures a national \nand international network of academic and political correspondents who are \nsympathetic to the issues raised during the miners\u201f strike. Her interests range \nbeyond mining and she has also promoted local campaigns relating to the \nenvironment and to poverty. The organisation of the savings group is one \nsuch response. \n \nThe Savings Group \n \nThe savings group is a community based response to the problem of debt. Its \nmembers include men, but it is the six women who participated in the focus \ngroup who maintain it. For Jean, it is also an effort to develop and \ncommunicate a politicised understanding of the problem: \nThere is one thing in this place which I am afraid is a microcosm of a \nbigger problem and that is poverty.  I am staging a personal war \nagainst these firms that come in and give you \u2013 \u2018Oh you will get \u00a3100, it \nwill only cost you \u00a310 a week.\u2019 I brought a letter in today that was sent \nto me \u2013 the APR on that sort of loan is 339 point something per cent\u2026. \n \nIt\u2019s the interest.  I mean it has got to be recognised sometime or other \nthat this would be the death of the communities.  You need legislation \n 20 \nto control this because this is predominantly women...they are preying \non poverty (Jean, savings group). \n \nThe lesson has not been lost on the other women who in the discussion were \nkeen to point out the vulnerability of local women to \u201eloan sharks\u201f.  \nThe reason they target the women is that it is always the woman who \nhas to provide for the kids as in clothes and things like that.  If they are \nlittle bit short, it is there it is handy and they will do it just to give the \nkids that little bit extra (Angela, savings group). \n \nThe political landscape of poverty is addressed in the female world through \nthe \u201epolitics of the doorstep\u201f which are played out in \u201ethe office\u201f. It was from \npeople coming to Jean for advice that the extent of dependence upon high \ninterest loans became evident, and it was through gathering people in her \nhome that she was able to initiate the savings group. \n \nJean collects the money and keeps the records. The organisation is decidedly \ninformal and based entirely upon trust. To organise the savings group into a \nCredit Union would be problematic in this environment as it would entail the \ncreation of formal systems of mutuality. Although this option seems not to \nhave been entirely discarded, members seem to prefer their current \npersonalised organisation which is derivative of the traditional informal \norganising approaches of local women.  \n \n 21 \nThe trust invested in Jean is based primarily on respect for her long-standing \nlocal activism, working in a way which the women believe represents their \ninterests. Members of the group reminisced about Jean\u201fs activities over the \nyears, providing her with opportunities and a platform in the discussion to tell \nher story. They gleefully recalled her role in the Jubilee celebrations in 1977, \nwhich they knew she would need to justify: \n \nJean \u2026. I am a republican, right! (Laughter). My sister wasn\u2019t.  She \nreally wanted to celebrate it but because I was there she got me to \norganise it\u2026 Well they wouldn\u2019t let us close the street down so we put \nthe dustbins along to stop the cars! \nHazel\u2026. Had the record player on the path! (Laughter). \n \nThey also prompted her to tell of her struggle with the local community centre \ncommittee \u201eto do something for the kids\u201f which the younger members \nremembered fondly:  \nJean \u2026..When we put the first disco on in the community centre. We \nhad to fight for it - not physically in the sense of fisticuffs, but it was a \nlong hard fight to get them [committee] to agree to let us use the hall \nand the kitchen and even then, every cup was locked away - we \nweren\u2019t allowed to use any of the facilities\u2026 \nDorothy...We had to buy our own cups, the coffee, the pop, everything. \nBut you were getting kids off the streets. \nLaura\u2026And we looked forward to that, growing up, you know, its Disco \nnight tonight!...But we loved it. \n 22 \n \nDespite their various ages and backgrounds, and the tenuous links with \nmining experience, the women in the savings group share a common \nunderstanding of women\u201fs traditional responsibilities within mining life. This is \nreinforced by the memories of the older members and particularly by the \nspace given to Jean\u201fs narratives. Significantly, the memories and narratives \nare not of domestic dependence and continuity, but of neighbourhood \ninvolvement and organisation and of the movement and change which always \ncharacterised mining life (Wilson, 1980).  Jean joked about her 1950s \nchildhood in a neighbouring mining village:   \u201eWhere I lived in number 234 \nthere were only 5 houses in the street. Now that\u201fs a decimated community!\u201f   \n\u201eCommunity\u201f has never been unself-conscious in mining life. Dealing actively \nwith the power of male dominated institutions and with change and insecurity \nis understood as part of the responsibility of women in relation to family and \nneighbourhood. Children, stability and security have traditionally been their \nresponsibility. \n \nNeighbourhood and Kin \nThe strong sense of neighbourhood which is part of the dynamic of the \nsavings group, is expressed partly through the terminology of kin. Two of the \nwomen, though not related by blood, have known Jean since childhood when \nthey referred to her as \u201eauntie\u201f:  \nHazel\u2026\u2018She was everybody\u2019s Auntie Jean.  She\u2019s great my Auntie   \nJean !\u2019 \n \n 23 \nIn contrast while actual extended family relationships continue to exist in the \nvillage, and are recognised as involving responsibilities and obligations, they \nare not integral to daily life.  The strong ties identified by Strangleman (2001) \nremain significant in terms of immediate inter-generational relationships, but \nthe savings group data suggests that the dependence on extended family \nshould not be exaggerated:  \nQ\u2026. Are you all still in touch with your own families? \nTheresa\u2026. Yes  \nHazel\u2026. Well if I see them on the street I\u2019ll speak but I don\u2019t go and \nknock on the door for a cup of tea. I mean I never have done\u2026 \nQ\u2026 Do you go to funerals and things? \nHazel\u2026. Oh yes\u2026 \nTheresa\u2026. Christenings and weddings and funerals. \nHazel\u2026.. But if I see them on the street, I say \u2018Hiya, are you alright?\u2019 \nBut I would never dream of going knocking on the door and saying \u2018Put \nthe kettle on\u2019. But I\u2019ve never been like that with any of my aunties or \nuncles.  I know they are there, I know who they are and I\u2019ll speak to \nthem.  \n \nEach of the women, including those too young to remember a local pit, \nreferred to the importance of their family history in mining,. For instance \nAngela who had not been brought up in the village explained the importance \nto her of her grandfather who had been a miner there. However, solidarity is \nnot necessarily manifest in blood ties.  Rather, collective and reciprocal \n 24 \nrelations are self-consciously experienced rather through a local friendship \nnetwork which overlaps and attains the status of kinship.  \n \nThe notion of kin links women\u201fs traditional family responsibilities with the \nmeaning they give to community. Jean is able to use this association to affirm \nher own authority and to encourage co-operation amongst the women in her \nnetwork. Reference to her as an \u201eauntie\u201f, is taken seriously and symbolises \nher benevolent relationship with younger members of the group. The \nyoungest member has consolidated this kin relationship by asking Jean to be \ngodmother to her baby daughter. The freedom which group members feel \nabout gathering in Jean\u201fs house also mirrors the connection between home \nand family.  Jean enjoys the respect gained from her familial role and \nexperiences the responsibilities which come with it as a privilege.  \n \nThe elision between kinship and community is not unproblematic in the sense \nthat it speaks of a tendency towards the more conservative notions of \n\u201ecommunity\u201f as a set of closed relationship which by virtue of their inclusivity \nfor those who belong, exclude those identified as \u201estrangers\u201f (Bauman, 2001). \nIt certainly created some difficulties during the strike in relation to the \nidentification of activist women with \u201eminers\u201f wives\u201f and some support groups \nactively excluded those who would be members but who were not directly \nrelated to miners (Stead, 1987). Nevertheless, there is evidence that in the \npost-mining context, the meanings of kinship have begun to take a different \nform. For example, a women\u201fs group in Staffordshire self consciously named \nitself a \u201eMiners\u201f Wives Support Group\u201f at the end of the strike, not as an \n 25 \nexpression of a familial relationship, but as an indication of a political \nrelationship in relation to coal (Newcastle, 2004)   \n \nSimilarly, the savings group has been created to some extent as a \u201efamily of \nchoice\u201f (Weeks, Heaphy and Donovan, 2001) as a contemporary response \nbased on traditional patterns and ideals.  Jean and Hazel are single women. \nHazel\u201fs mother\u201fs mother, Dorothy is divorced, and the three other women \ninvolved live with men. Only three of the women are mothers. Yet they \nunanimously identified their primary collective concern in terms of the needs \nof local children. The loss of community resources associated with pit \nclosures, was epitomised for them by the absence of facilities and services for \nchildren: \u201eThere are not even any swings any more.\u201f Their concern echoes \nthat of the residents of Warsop Vale whose initial collective efforts were \nenergised by a successful campaign for play facilities (Waddington, 2003; \n2005). Members of the savings group had at various times voluntarily \norganised activities for local children and young people.  Meanwhile, Jean \ncreates space for the participation and education of children in all her projects.  \n \nDuring the strike, the initial role taken by women extended their traditional \ndomestic work into the public arena (Allen, 2001). It has been argued that \nwomen\u201fs activism could only be fully accommodated by the class politics of \nthe NUM with reference to traditional private roles within home and family \n(Spence, 1998). Insofar as it fitted this pattern, female activism during the \nstrike was indicative of an exceptional moment. However, \u201ethe private\u201f for \nwomen in mining life has never been fully contained within the home. Rather it \n 26 \nhas always been an aspect of their everyday lives, overlapping with the public \nsphere.  \n \nWomen\u201fs public participation has sometimes been characterised by historians \nof community and of social policy as \u201ematernalism\u201f (Koven and Michel, 1990). \nMaternalism suggests the means whereby \u201enatural\u201f feminine concerns can be \npublicly played out without threatening gender stereotypes. The concept is \noften used to refer to the historical role of middle class women in social work.  \nIn the miners\u201f strike, working class identification foreclosed the intervention of \na type of maternalism which is born of class patronage (Rowbotham and \nMcCrindle, 1986; Stead, 1987). Nevertheless, the concept can explain a  \nsense of  \u201emothering\u201f as a co-operative, neighbourhood endeavour based on \na common understanding of the responsibilities of women and as the means \nwhereby women, and in particular single women, are enabled to engage in \ncollective, community action (see also Reynolds, 2003).  \n \nThe savings group discussion suggests that such public \u201emothering\u201f \nexpresses the manner in which kin, neighbourhood and community of place \nand interest overlap. Domestic space for women in mining communities \ntraditionally included the \u201ecommunity of place\u201f in neighbourhood , which was \nthe bedrock for a \u201ecommunity of interest\u201f manifest in more formal, male \ndominated local institutions (Dennis et al, 1956; Williamson, 1982; Thew, \n1985). The traditional political virtues of collectivity and solidarity associated \nwith mining have traditionally been expressed in female discourse through the \nlanguage of kinship and maternalism. This was the framework within which \n 27 \nwomen\u201fs actions in the strike were conceived and it remains pertinent in the \npost-mining environment as a location for collective organisation and political \nawareness.  The actions and understanding of the women in the savings \ngroup, facilitated and encouraged by Jean are in direct lineage from those \nmobilised by WAPC during the strike. \n \nStrike Stories \nA politically informed maternalism became particularly meaningful during the \nstrike in the lead up to Christmas 1984. This traditional time for families and \nfor indulging children was seriously threatened by the hardship endured by \nthose who had lived without wages for eight months. The stress experienced \nby families threatened the solidarity of the strike. That Christmas was \nexperienced as a pivotal moment for those involved and Jean\u201fs memories are \nno exception. She communicates her understanding of its significance, \nincorporating the values of the strike, primarily through her story of the \u201eToy \nand Turkey\u201f appeal- \u201eA toy for every child and a turkey for every family\u201f: \n \nHave I ever told you the full story of that day? So there was one load of \nturkeys arrived a day early. The second load was delayed, so it came \non 21st December. And then the chickens, which we got from Liverpool, \ncouldn\u2019t find Easington, never mind Murton. So the lorry load we got \nfrom Cardiff found us, and we got the chickens, but the ones from \nLiverpool we couldn\u2019t find anywhere and we kept getting calls from \nthem! We\u2019d go, \u2018Where are you now?\u2019 (Laughter). \n 28 \nThat\u2019s bad enough as an organisational thing, but my car wouldn\u2019t start \nat four o\u2019clock in the morning and I had to get people out of bed to give \nme a push. I got down there to find all this chaos was going on at \nMurton Welfare and the next thing that happened was the flying picket \nwhich we hadn\u2019t been told about was at Murton this week. So we had \nall these miners descending on us to picket Hawthorn Coke Works at \nMurton.  \nThe next thing was that the women in Murton say \u2018There\u2019s a hell of a lot \nof people here, how are we going to put on meals for all these?\u2019  It was \ndecided that they had better do something you know, \u2018Do what you \ncan!\u2019 But then two Euro MPs arrived to draw the Toy and Turkey \nappeal tickets. And they gave us this big drum, which didn\u2019t work. \nEvery time it was turned it fell off the pedestal and poured the tickets \nout. But we finally got the miners fixing that up and there was all these \npeople waiting for the Toy and Turkey appeal and there were loads of \nprizes to give out.  \nShe ends the story by saying:  \n Once we got the turkeys and chickens on-site, the organisation was \nspot-on. Because once we got them there, people collected their stuff \nand went. By 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, it was all over. They decided to \ngive me a chicken, but I couldn\u2019t face it. We had pork instead. I couldn\u2019t \nface it; they were coming out of my ears. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever \nseen 21,000 frozen chickens and turkeys?  (Jean, savings group). \n  \n 29 \nThis is one of Jean \u201fs favourite memories. It was repeated in the individual \ninterview and later in a WAPC reunion discussion (Newcastle, 2004). The \nstory was clearly part of the repertoire of the savings group: the women \nencouraged Jean to retell it.  \n \nIt is meaningful to the women not only because it resonates with \nresponsibilities for kin and community, but also because it displays a \ncollective commitment which involves and connects neighbours, local women, \nminers, trade unionists, workers from other parts of Britain and  European \npoliticians. The story is underpinned by the virtue of tenacity in extraordinarily \ndifficult circumstances.  It emphasises the possibility of creating order out of \nchaos against overwhelming odds, through the values of determination, \nselflessness, mutuality and above all collective endeavour and organisation \nwhich is lived in the local context, but links with unknown others from external \nlocations who share the same principles. At the same time, it incorporates the \npossibility of individual choice (\u201eI had pork instead\u201f). This affirms the model for \nthe savings group and for the type of community for which they strive.   \n \nStory telling is a source of great humour and entertainment and an important \nmethod of making sense of the changes which are being experienced in the \nlocality. In particular, Jean\u201fs stories derived from the political education gained \nduring the strike, and validated by the shared experiences with the others, \nencourages the savings group women, helping  to establish a set of meanings \nwhich facilitate the maintenance of the group as a coherent entity (Plummer, \n 30 \n1995; Southerton, 2002) They also reinforce the legitimacy of Jean\u201fs position \nin relation to the group and the neighbourhood.  \n \nRepeated stories recreate the mining past as a place of self reliance and \nmutual support. The village is represented as a community of place and \ninterest with a collective memory of a positive way of living which enabled \npeople to come out winning, whatever the reality. Jean is a particularly \npowerful narrator because she is able to weave together tales in which \npersonal details and action are situated within a larger context \u2013 invariably \ninvolving struggles for control, if not power, in which justice wins out. Her \nstories gain influence because her communication skills combine with her \nreputation as an activist and a sympathetic and reliable friend\/auntie to local \npeople in need.  \n \nConstructing a community ideal  \nThrough their friendship, the women in the savings group attempt to create \nand recreate an ideal of community promoted in Jean\u201fs stories. The axis upon \nwhich this is balanced is a shared understanding of a mining past which is \nviewed by the women as a community of security and intimacy. \n   \nQ\u2026\u2026.What was it like when you were younger to live in  [the village]? \nHazel\u2026Secure. Because everybody knew everybody. \nQ..........Secure? \nHazel.....You felt secure because everybody knew everybody. You felt \nsecure  because you could go out when you were young and you knew \n 31 \neverybody. You know what I mean; it was a village where everybody \nknew everybody as you were growing up. \n \nThe idea, remembered or imagined, that the village represented the security \nof a known community, encouraged identification with place. It drew the \nwomen back even when they or their families had been forced away to find \nwork.  The group concluded that this was about a sense of belonging:  \nQ\u2026Have you moved around? \nHazel: \u2026.Where the jobs are\u2026 I would move away for jobs. Which I\u2019ve \ndone, but I always seem to end up coming back.  I would stay for a \ncouple of years and another job would come up and I would move \ndown to Southend or somewhere and stay there for a couple of years, \nand I always end up coming back here for some stupid reason. \nLaura\u2026. Somewhere you know: home! \nDorothy\u2026It\u2019s called roots \n \nHowever, community as a place located in family and neighbourhood is no \nlonger real.   \nHazel\u2026In my street, I mean, I would never think of going and knocking \non my next-door neighbour and say and \u2018have you got a spare bit milk \nor an egg?\u2019 I mean if I need anything I ring Jean, because I know Jean, \nyou know what I mean? Or I would ring Angela, but not like my next-\ndoor neighbour. \n \n 32 \nFor these women in the post mining context, cohesive local relationships are \nfacilitated primarily by friendship groups who draw from the discourses of kin \nand community to shape their activities and their understanding of the forces \nimpacting upon their lives.      \n \nConclusion \nThe working class women who spoke to us bring public matters into the \nhome, and private matters into the street and public office. They do not \ndistinguish the private and public as separate places. The home can become \nan office.  What is of interest is not the separation of these two spaces, but \ntheir inter-relationship in the process of women\u201fs organisation. This broadens \nthe sphere of class politics for working class women, and to maintain such an \ninter-relationship has been a conscious choice for activist women who were \ninvolved in the miners\u201f strike in the North East of England.  \n \nThe interactions of the everyday world of doorstep politics are largely \nmundane (\u201eWho can I borrow an egg from?\u201f) but for self-consciously political \nwomen such as Jean, organisation based upon the collective principle \nassociated with trade unionism and the labour movement exists just as much \nwithin the reciprocal relations which can be fostered within the private and the \nmundane  as within the public and the exotic.  A failure to examine the \n\u201eprivate\u201f and \u201eeveryday\u201f is to be gender blind to the possibility that collective \nprinciples and action exist not just in the formal world of work, labour politics \nand civic institutions but in the back street and the living rooms of working \nclass houses. \n 33 \n \nIn a period when \u201ecommunity\u201f based upon common conditions derived from \nlabour relations cannot be taken for granted, it should not be assumed that \nconsequently the possibility of constructing community based upon locally \ndefined, self consciously held values  has disappeared. The locus of the \nmaintenance of a co-operative approach to practical problems and political \nissues in ex-mining localities has shifted from the industrial front to what \ntraditionally has been the female sphere associated with friendship, kin and \nneighbourhood.  Understanding the nature of agency exercised by women \nactivists in these circumstances suggests the possibility of building new and \nmore extensive forms of political organisation which interconnect the separate \nspheres of work and home, public and private, male and female.   \n 34 \nReferences \n \nAllen, M.

Although there is a strong case for using the women\u2019s own \nnames in terms of the contribution which they have made to the history of mining life, it was agreed \nwith the women at the outset to anonymise them. \u2018Jean\u2019 was the name chosen by this important \nparticipant.  \n2\n Thomas Hepburn  founded the Northern Union of Pitmen in 1831. He was known as a man of peace \nand used his influence to help prevent rioting and violence during strikes. Nevertheless he was banned \nfrom working in the northern coalfield because of his role in the organisation of strikes in 1831 and \n1832.  \n3\n Peter Lee was a miner who became leader of England\u2019s first all-Labour County Council in Durham in \n1909. The new town Peterlee is named after him.  \n4\n Sam Watson (1898-1967) was Secretary of the Durham Miners\u2019 Union until 1963. He was known for \nhis commitment to the education of miners and ran tutorial classes in Redhill the Durham Headquarters \n 40 \n                                                                                                                                            \nof the Union. His name is linked with a convalescent home for miners\u2019 wives, opened in 1961 in \nhonour of his commitment to the well being of women associated with mining.  \n"}
