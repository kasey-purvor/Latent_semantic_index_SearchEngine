This article does not so much criticise\nthis fairly modest understanding of social justice as ask whether the kind of social policies\nthat New Labour has devised are capable of delivering \u2018opportunity for all\u2019. The suggestion\nis that, because \u2018targeted\u2019 policies \u2013 Labour\u2019s local regeneration initiatives are the example\ntaken here \u2013 face intrinsic difficulties as vehicles for social inclusion and thus greater\nequality of access to opportunity, they need to be supported by a wider commitment to\ndistributive justice.\nThe changed nature of the Labour Party\u2019s \u2018public philosophy of social justice\u2019 since the\nemergence of New Labour has been the subject of sustained academic commentary\nfor some years now. Often discussed in terms of the merits, or otherwise, of \u2018third way\nwelfare\u2019, debate has turned around the shift towards a conception of social policy that\nstresses individual responsibilities as well as social rights and the benefits of a welfare mix\nthat increasingly favours market, or market-oriented, solutions, supported by an enabling\n\u2018opportunity state\u2019 (see for example Driver and Martell, 1998; Dwyer, 2000; Giddens,\n1998, 2000; Le Grand, 1998; Levitas, 2005; Lister, 2000; Powell, 1999, 2000; Prideaux,\n2005). While these debates have done an enormous amount to enhance understanding\nof the UK\u2019s contemporary welfare system, their focus has clearly been on change, its\nconsequences and possible explanations for the shift away from the post-war Keynesian\nwelfare state (see also Powell and Hewitt, 2002). The approach taken here is to ask\nwhether New Labour\u2019s social justice rhetoric, as highlighted in politicians\u2019 statements\nand Party manifestoes, is matched in policy practice.\nIt can be invidious to cherry-pick soundbites from politicians\u2019 writings and speeches,\nbut the main objectives of New Labour\u2019s public philosophy are clear. The notion of\nopportunity as a means of contributing to a social and political environment characterised\nby an emphasis on equal worth and respect is unmistakeable. For example, Tony Blair,\nin his speech to the Labour Party Conference in 1999, maintained that it was \u2018not equal\nincomes. Not uniform lifestyles or taste or culture. But true equality \u2013 equal worth, an\nequal chance of fulfilment, equal access to knowledge and opportunity\u2019 that was Labour\u2019s\ngoal (BBC: 1999, our emphasis). More recently, in 2005, Blair argued in similar terms that\n\u2018the only society that works today is . . . one founded on mutual respect, on a recognition\nthat we have a responsibility collectively and individually, to help each other on the basis\n337\nNick Ellison and Sarah Ellison\nof each other\u2019s equal worth\u2019 (Blair, 2005: 2). And equal worth, though never properly\nelaborated, is set in the context of a society which gives individuals \u2018the chance to make\nthe most of themselves, to lead a fulfilled life, to feel they are participating members\nof our community\u2019 (Blair, 2005: 3). For Gordon Brown, too, equal worth entails equal\naccess to opportunities. As he wrote in 1999, \u2018the starting point is a fundamental belief\nin the equal worth of every human being\u2019 \u2013 and \u2018if every person is to be regarded as of\nequal worth, all deserve to be given an equal chance in life to fulfil the potential with\nwhich they were born\u2019 (Brown, 1999: 40). These themes are clearly present in Labour\u2019s\n2005 General Election manifesto: in his Forward, Blair refers to the government\u2019s desire to\n\u2018extend opportunity to all\u2019 (Labour Party, 2005: 3), while the Manifesto itself promises that\n\u2018no area of our country should be excluded from the opportunity to get ahead\u2019 (Labour\nParty, 2005: 20).\nIn terms of social strategy, these ideals frequently take policy form in the preoccupa-\ntion with social inclusion as the gateway to the \u2018opportunity society\u2019. The egalitarian\nquality of this commitment is, at best, unclear: as Driver and Martell argue, \u2018a key\ncharacteristic of [New Labour\u2019s] approach is an orientation to inclusion into the world\nof opportunities as much as equality of opportunity within it\u2019 (2002: 77, our emphases).\nCertainly, even the briefest visit to the website of the Social Exclusion Unit demonstrates\na concern about social inclusion, at least as the term is narrowly defined, as enabling\nthe poorest and most vulnerable groups to gain greater access to education and training,\nemployment, health and healthy environments. But, can the policies developed to create\ngreater social inclusion actually do so in ways that lead to a society that extends\nopportunity equally to all? What follows takes one area of policy-making \u2013 neighbourhood\nregeneration and policy initiatives currently being developed under the aegis of the \u2018New\nLocalism\u2019 \u2013 to consider whether core policy initiatives are likely to provide a framework\nable to support New Labour\u2019s stated ambitions. Why this area? For one thing, New Labour\nhas always made much of \u2018community\u2019, particularly the need for local communities to\nbe \u2018strong\u2019 and \u2018responsible\u2019 (see Mandelson and Liddle, 1996). Just as significantly, it\nis clear from recent work by Wheeler et al. (2005) and Dorling and Thomas (2004) that\ninequalities have a spatial dimension. Indeed it appears from this research that localities\nwith high levels of poor health and\/or low educational attainment are also those with the\nleast resources \u2013 whether these be key personnel like doctors and teachers, or employment\nopportunities. On this reading, it seems that, despite the fact that the precise nature of\nthe relationship between the physical and social environments and poverty\/inequality has\nproved hard to ascertain (see Atkinson and Kintrea, 2000, 2001; Buck, 2001; Forrest and\nKearns, 2001, Lister, 2004; Powell et al., 2001), the geographical dimension of inequality\nnevertheless needs to be prioritised as part of a general effort to enhance opportunities.\nArea regenera t ion po l i c ies under New Labour\nNew Labour believes that high-quality services, delivered by local partnerships\ncharacterised by high levels of user and community participation, and offering sufficient\nconsumer choice, are the best means of ensuring that the most deprived communities are\n\u2018regenerated\u2019 and \u2018socially included\u2019 (SEU, 2000, 2003; CRU, 2003, 2004). In particular,\nas the government has consistently maintained, poverty, poor health, low educational\nqualifications, un- or under-employment, poor housing and high crime must be eradicated\nif communities and those living in them are to make the most of the opportunities on offer.\n338\nCreating \u2018Opportunity for All\u2019? New Labour, New Localism and the Opportunity Society\nA brief examination of this hugely complex policy area shows, as Lupton (2003:\n141) notes, that there have been two distinct phases of policy, the first of which\ncontinued, but added to, \u2018the short-life area-based spending programmes managed by\nmulti-agency partnerships\u2019 of New Labour\u2019s Conservative predecessors. This phase saw\nthe development of key area-based initiatives, such as the New Deal for Communities,\nEmployment Zones, Education Action Zones, Health Action Zones, Sure Start and other\nprogrammes. Some of these initiatives have been discontinued, but others are in the\nprocess of being \u2018mainstreamed\u2019 into more comprehensive area programmes \u2013 Children\u2019s\nCentres in the case of Sure Start, for example. The second phase, dating from 2001,\nis more significant and has been \u2018marked by the introduction of the National Strategy\nfor Neighbourhood Renewal\u2019 (NSNR), which places \u2018greater emphasis on establishing\nmainstream structures and funding mechanisms that . . . ensure a longer-term focus on the\nproblems of poor areas, and reach a larger number of areas than area-based programmes\ncould possibly target\u2019. Stung by accusations of \u2018control freakery\u2019 (see Geddes, 2000;\nClarke and Glendinning, 2002; Rummery, 2002) and swayed by arguments about the\nimportance of social capital and \u2018capacity building\u2019 (see CRU, 2003), as part of the NSNR\nNew Labour has explicitly targeted the 88 most deprived local authority areas with a\nview to focusing on \u2018mainstream services as well as additional programmes within a\nstrategic and coordinated approach\u2019 (Lupton, 2003: 144). Each of these authorities has\nbeen required to establish Local Strategic Partnerships (LSPs), regarded as the best means\nof engaging relevant agencies from the private, public and voluntary sectors in developing\nlocal renewal strategies \u2013 the LSPs being supported by the Office of the Deputy Prime\nMinister\u2019s (ODPM) Neighbourhood Renewal Unit, regional Neighbourhood Renewal\nTeams and various forms of funding, including Neighbourhood Renewal funding and a\nCommunity Empowerment Fund specifically \u2018to support community involvement in LSPs\u2019\n(Lupton and Power, 2005: 122). More recently the development of Local Area Agreements\n(LAAs), currently being rolled out to all top-tier local authorities by 2007 and \u2018intended\nas mechanisms for delivering better local service outcomes through better coordination\nbetween central government and local authorities and their partners\u2019 (ODPM, 2005: 5),\nwill effectively extend the logic of LSPs to all local authorities and build on other initiatives\nsuch as Local Public Service Agreements.\nRegenera t ion and renewa l : towards the oppor tun i t y soc ie ty?\nAlthough it is not possible to examine the impact of these renewal policies in depth,\nresearch by CASE at the LSE indicates that civic renewal has had some positive effect on\nemployment rates, schools (primary schools in particular) and some elements of health\ncare. Looking at \u2018overall improvements\u2019, Lupton and Power (2005: 129) conclude that\n\u2018on all the areas that the government has targeted, there have been improvements, in\naggregate, in the poorest local authority areas\u2019. So, for example, with reference to social\nhousing, there has been a reduction in homes falling beneath the decency standard,\nwhile \u2018employment rates have risen . . . in the 30 worst local authorities since 1998 and\nslightly faster than the national rate\u2019 (Lupton and Power, 2005: 127). There are problems,\nhowever. The research also acknowledges that \u2018in most cases it seems likely that, despite\nthe progress made, the government will not succeed in relation to its own targets, at least\nat the current level of intervention\u2019. At neighbourhood level, more specifically, results are\nmixed, and although some trends appear encouraging, as an indication of \u2018the success\n339\nNick Ellison and Sarah Ellison\nof the NSNR . . . [they are] at best, inconclusive\u2019 (Lupton and Power, 2005: 130). Lupton\nand Power (2005: 130) go on to argue that \u2018we cannot expect neighbourhood policy on\nits own to deliver better neighbourhood outcomes\u2019.\nThe picture to date, then, is one of small-step improvements in certain areas but\nnothing on the scale required to achieve the kind of sea-change necessary to achieve\nNew Labour\u2019s goal of equal access to opportunities. The key question, therefore, is why\nwidespread social inclusion may be difficult to achieve in practice and, beyond this,\nwhether current policies can realistically hope to create conditions for \u2018opportunity for\nall\u2019. It is argued here that three closely related difficulties stand out in particular, namely\nthe problems of \u2018control\u2019, participation and user involvement, and social closure. These\nissues will be considered in turn.\nThe problem of control refers to the contested nature of power, autonomy and interest\nin what Filkin et al. (2000) and others (see Pratchett, 2004; Stoker, undated) call the \u2018New\nLocalism\u2019. For Stoker (nd: 3), the New Localism represents an attempt to respond to \u2018a\nsignificant practical challenge\u2019, which he defines as:\nhow to manage a substantial variety of state service provision and interventions in a world\nthat defies the application of simple rule-driven interventions and often requires an effective\nresponse from the recipient of the service or intervention in order for the state action to work.\nThe New Localist approach, very much embodied in LSPs and LAAs, is to recognise\n\u2018the importance of national standards and priorities as a driving force for public\npolicy\u2019 with the centre stressing \u2018particular policy outcomes and [focusing] attention\non particular priorities\u2019, while simultaneously recognising \u2018the primacy of the institutions\nof local governance in delivering public services on behalf of the centre, as well as\nwider arguments for locally sensitive policy implementation and community leadership\u2019\n(Pratchett, 2004: 369). However, this statement conceals real difficulties associated with\nthe ultimate location of control, as Pratchett (2004: 371) acknowledges.\nSome of these difficulties have begun to surface in the pilot group of LAAs.\nIt is clear, for instance, that developing an LAA is \u2018an extremely resource-intensive\nprocess, involving a large amount of work in a short period of time, out of phase\nwith other established planning processes\u2019 (ODPM, 2005: 34). Coordination among\ncentral government departments, government offices and local partners in the pursuit\nof their LAAs, though broadly dialogic and possibly contributing to \u2018stronger and\nmore effective partnerships\u2019 (ODPM, 2005: 102), has proved difficult, with complaints\narising about \u2018micro-management and [demands for] a greater devolution of control to\nlocalities\u2019 (ODPM, 2005: 104). It appears that, despite accusations of over-centralisation,\nthe government remains reluctant \u2018to accept many of the requests for freedoms and\nflexibilities\u2019 demanded by LAA teams (ODPM, 2005: 10) \u2013 and this desire to control\noutcomes risks alienating and disillusioning local partners. And yet, on the other hand, in\nview of the wide range of agencies and sectors involved in different LAAs, and the clash\nof interests and assumptions in some cases, the absence of firm central control, clear\nperformance targets and the paraphernalia of the contemporary \u2018evaluation culture\u2019, risks\nentangling this version of \u2018top-down\u2013bottom-up\u2019 multi-agency working in organisational\nchaos. These complex problems demonstrate that the balance of power in the New\nLocalist paradigm is far from straightforward (Somerville, 2004) and it remains to be seen\n340\nCreating \u2018Opportunity for All\u2019? New Labour, New Localism and the Opportunity Society\nwhether a coherent governance framework can emerge from the LAA process. There are\nreal difficulties here that may prove insurmountable: most obviously the perennial issue\nof how to resolve the contradictions inherent in any desire to achieve national outcomes\nby means of local autonomy.\nOn the second issue, \u2018participation\u2019 and user involvement ostensibly offer a means,\nnot only of building capacity for greater civic engagement, but developing positive\nattitudes on the part of local citizens towards their neighbourhoods and communities in\nways that could potentially increase self-confidence and so lead to a greater willingness\nand ability to take up the opportunities on offer (see for example, CRU, 2003, 2004).\nEvidence is patchy, however. Qualitative research certainly reports a greater sense of\nempowerment deriving from \u2018shared experience\u2019 for certain users of certain programmes\nor projects in certain areas (Williams, 2004: 434). Nevertheless, while the \u2018inward-\nlooking\u2019 initiatives of small-scale community projects, local Sure Start programmes and\nso on may produce instances of individualised empowerment, CASE research indicates\nthat \u2018outward-looking\u2019 participation including \u2018levels of active involvement in decision\nmaking with local government and service providers\u2019 have not increased significantly\n(Richardson, 2005: 105). One problem is that different government initiatives operate\nwith different ideas of \u2018participation\u2019, with inevitable tensions developing among local\nauthorities, partnership agencies and community participants. In this regard, a recent\nreview of evidence relating to the New Localism (Aspden and Birch, 2005: 121\u2013122)\nhighlights a number of issues concerning the difficulties that LSPs currently face when\nundertaking community engagement. Practices vary enormously across local authorities,\nbut the reviewers note, for instance, that local councillors are wary about the role of the\nvoluntary and community sectors in local initiatives, and in particular how the enhanced\ninvolvement of these sectors challenges councillors\u2019 self-perception \u2018as legitimate and\naccountable community leaders and representatives\u2019.\nThere are a number of reasons why participation at this critical level is likely to\nprove difficult. Leaving aside the thorny issue of the nature of the relationship between\n\u2018participation\u2019 and \u2018democracy\u2019, it is likely, as Stevens et al. (2003: 90) argue, that\nforms of community involvement will be perceived differently depending on particular\nperspectives and affiliations. As mentioned above, \u2018local authorities are still resistant to\ndialogue and lack the political will of officer drive for involvement\u2019 (Richardson, 2005:\n109), Richardson commenting that agencies can find it difficult to listen and respond,\nwhile potential participants can feel intimidated, either by those in authority or, indeed,\nby other groups more used to having \u2018voice\u2019. It is the case, too, that participation is often\ninterpreted as \u2018consultation\u2019 \u2013 certainly devices such as focus groups, citizens\u2019 juries,\nvisioning exercises and so on currently popular with local authorities are essentially\n\u2018consultative\u2019 \u2013 as opposed to anything more \u2018active\u2019 (Aspden and Birch, 2005: 59).\nFurthermore, it is unclear how actively the less affluent can participate. In the case\nof unemployed people, for example, it could be hard to square participation in local\ncommunity development initiatives with the pressures of the \u2018employment first\u2019 welfare\nstate (Finn, 2005) and the requirement to seek work, and make the most of the employment\nopportunities on offer. The general point, however, is that active citizenship, participation\nand involvement are, at best, ambiguous goods: individuals and communities can feel\nempowered \u2013 but there is equal scope for disempowerment and alienation as the\ncomplexities of power and interest surrounding decision-making processes are revealed\n341\nNick Ellison and Sarah Ellison\nto groups, many of which will have little previous experience of the (local) political realm\n(Dinham, 2005).\nThe final issue concerns social closure. For all the criticisms, there is no doubting\nthe plethora of initiatives that New Labour has devised to encourage regeneration and\ncivic renewal (SEU, 2000; CRU, 2003, 2004). However, it may be that initiatives tar-\ngeted at creating social inclusion in the poorest areas, though well-meaning, are simply\nunable to expand opportunities on a sufficiently equal basis to offset the inbuilt ad-\nvantages of more affluent areas and those who live in them. The nature and distribution\nof social capital is an issue here. Following the work of Frank Parkin (1979), a number\nof urban sociologists (Buck, 2005; Butler, 2004, 2005, Atkinson and Kintrea, 2001) have\nrevisited the phenomenon of social closure. They suggest that social capital and capacity\nbuilding have a downside and stress the exclusive character of certain social networks\n(see also Williams, 2004). Buck (2005: 58), for instance, argues that there are \u2018some\nobvious examples of tight networks within local communities which are \u201canti-social\u201d in\nterms of their effects . . . on . . . \u201cinclusion\u201d\u2019. His point is that \u2018we need to be concerned . . .\nwith patterns of inter-connectedness, and with the (social) distribution of . . . social\ncapital\u2019.\nThe work of Butler and Robson (2004) on middle-class gentrification in London\nprovides a rather different example of the ways in which culturally and economically\nrich networks can close out other groups, while Atkinson (2006) goes further in noting\nthe increasing tendency of the better off literally to exclude themselves by creating gated\ncommunities. Of course, closure is not only the province of the middle classes: active,\ninward-looking local communities with high degrees of internal participation can also\ndevelop on ethnic and\/or socio-cultural lines, and work in ways that, intentionally or not,\ncan intimidate and exclude others, reducing opportunities and restricting life chances in\nthe process.\nA different version of social closure originates from \u2018structural\u2019 problems, which it\nmight simply be beyond the capacity of governments to control. Lupton and Power (2005:\n136) point out that people naturally move between neighbourhoods with the result that\n\u2018even within a local authority area, poor neighbourhoods as a whole may improve, but\nsome . . . may become a lot worse because of the exodus of more advantaged residents to\nimproving neighbourhoods and an increasing concentration of the most disadvantaged\nin others\u2019. Low housing demand and an excess of school places can lead people to avoid\ncertain areas, resulting in local spatial segregation \u2013 a feature which could be exacerbated\nby the increasing availability of internet-based neighbourhood information for potential\nmovers and house-buyers (Burrows and Ellison, 2004; Burrows et al., 2005). In such\ncases, inclusion-intensive policies may not be able to make a sufficiently marked impact\non local opportunity structures to compensate for embedded difficulties of this kind. For\nthis reason, Lupton (2003: 220) concluded her study of 12 of the most disadvantaged areas\nin England and Wales by arguing that \u2018somewhat depressingly, we will not see an end\nto what I have called . . . \u2018Poverty Street\u2019. Poor areas will always exist [because] . . . since\nchoice will always enable the better-off to choose where they live, the poor will always\nbe concentrated, to some extent, in the least favourable locations\u2019. Social policy can, of\ncourse, potentially make a difference but, as Lupton (2003: 20) argues:\nWe will not bring an end to the problems of \u2018Poverty Street\u2019 either by reducing residential\nsegregation or by improving management and services, unless we are also prepared to challenge\n342\nCreating \u2018Opportunity for All\u2019? New Labour, New Localism and the Opportunity Society\nseriously the inequalities in our economy and society that are the real causes of relative poverty\nand social exclusion.\nThis claim clearly opens up the wider question of how feasible it is to rely on targeted\npolicy initiatives to achieve the broader vision of social justice contained in New Labour\u2019s\npublic philosophy of opportunity for all. It is to this issue that we now turn.\nRed is t r ibu t ion and \u2018oppor tun i t y fo r a l l \u2019\nThe above examination of New Localist social inclusion strategies has suggested that\nhopes of developing forms of inclusion capable of ensuring a greater equality of access to\nopportunities across space are unlikely to be realised owing to the inherent complexities\nand contradictions involved. Some may object, of course, that there is more to New\nLabour\u2019s social inclusion agenda than regeneration initiatives \u2013 employment policy being\nan obvious example. This is certainly the case, although where employment is concerned\nWheeler et al. (2005) point out that much is awry in the \u2018employment first welfare state\u2019.\nHigh-status jobs are unevenly distributed and the \u2018country appears to be divided into\n\u201cwork rich\u201d and \u201cwork poor\u201d areas\u2019 (Wheeler et al., 2005: 1), the implication being that\nlocality plays a significant role in determining the chances of finding a \u2018good job\u2019. In\naddition, it is not clear that the various New Deals offer genuine work opportunities (and\nof course the stress is always on paid work). Employment strategies that aim to contribute\nto \u2018opportunity for all\u2019 surely require \u2018real jobs\u2019 and a more generous interpretation of\nwhat counts as work if the ills of poor working conditions, low waged employment and\nthe invisibility of certain forms of social contribution are to be challenged (see Levitas,\n2005; White, 2003).\nReturning to the general principles that underpin New Labour\u2019s public philosophy,\nhowever, if policies specifically targeted at, inter alia, neighbourhood regeneration,\nemployment or, for that matter, education and health, are always likely to be vulnerable\nto the embedded nature of socio-spatial inequalities, as Dorling (2001) and others (Forrest\nand Kearns, 2001) demonstrate, then a more \u2018universal\u2019 approach to the redistribution\nof opportunity through an attack on income and wealth inequalities, and a related\ncommitment to improving social and intergenerational mobility, may also be needed\nto complement them. At the very least, a commitment of this kind would help to ensure\nthat excessive material wealth and the proceeds of \u2018good fortune\u2019 could not accumulate in\nways that unduly privilege the life-chances of better-off groups \u2013 perpetuating inequality of\nopportunity as a result. So, at bottom, if access to opportunities is to be made more equal,\nthere is likely to be a need for what Tawney (1964) referred to as \u2018practical equality\u2019. By\nthis term he meant a policy environment that provides citizens with a sufficiently \u2018equal\nstart\u2019 in terms of goods, services and conditions of life, and subsequent fair access to\nrelevant resources, to allow them to make fair use of their individual capacities. Practical\nequality also implies a commitment to social and intergenerational mobility, and, in\nconsequence, the conviction that material inequalities should be constrained at least to\nthe point where equal worth and equal respect \u2013 core elements of the opportunity society \u2013\nare not invalidated by the ability of the better off not so much to \u2018exclude\u2019 themselves as\nto become \u2018exclusive\u2019.\nTawney wrote in a different time and a different idiom, to be sure, but this approach to\nsocial justice influenced Labour Party thinkers and policy makers for the greater part of the\n343\nNick Ellison and Sarah Ellison\npostwar period (see Ellison, 1994; Foote, 1985), and its underlying logic, if not the precise\ndetail, continues to resonate among academic commentators today. Stuart White\u2019s (2003)\nrecent work on the \u2018civic minimum\u2019 is a contemporary example of an attempt to fashion a\nleft-of-centre vision for new times. Placed within a framework of \u2018fair reciprocity\u2019, where\ncitizens are expected to perform certain duties (to take reasonable offers of paid work or\nperform other vital responsibilities such as caring for the vulnerable), citizens have a right\nto a \u2018high minimum\u2019 of income security in addition to \u2018a decent minimum of health care\nand disability coverage\u2019 (White, 2003: 202), educational provision and so on. White goes\ninto great detail with respect to possible mechanisms of financing a complex mixture\nof compensatory social benefits and asset-based egalitarianism, but it is important to\nnote his conviction that talent-based income inequalities and inequalities resulting from\nwealth transfers need to be sharply reduced through various forms of taxation in order\nto eliminate \u2018bad luck inequalities\u2019, finance decent levels of income and service support,\nand also to provide \u2018basic capital grants\u2019 from public funds to be paid to all citizens on\nmaturity.\nObviously, the complexities underpinning issues of this kind cannot be dealt with\nhere. What constitutes a fair level of resources, how \u2018desert\u2019 is conceived, questions\nabout \u2018incentives\u2019, which inequalities can be justified and how, and the overall balance\nbetween \u2018liberty\u2019 and \u2018equality\u2019, particularly perhaps where taxation is concerned, remain\nkey problems in political theory, which this article does not seek to address (see, for\nexample, Rawls, 1999; Walzer, 1984; Miller, 2005; White, 2003). For present purposes,\nwhat matters is that New Labour\u2019s apparently moderate public philosophy of social justice\nas equal access to opportunities will need a radical twist if the difficulties associated with\ntargeted policies are to be overcome. So, where poorer neighbourhoods, communities\nand their inhabitants are concerned, for example, access to core opportunities in the\nform of good jobs and public services must not only be at least roughly equal between\npoorer and more affluent spaces, and recipients themselves empowered to capitalise on\nopportunities irrespective of class, gender, ethnicity or (dis)ability, but supporting policies,\nperhaps taxation in particular, need to be developed in ways that discourage the holding\nof excessive material wealth and resources, while simultaneously encouraging high levels\nof social and intergenerational mobility.\nTo date, the briefest assessment of New Labour\u2019s record indicates that \u2018where\nredistribution has taken place it has been . . . limited to improving the situation of those\nat the bottom relative to the middle, with the position of those at the top considered\nirrelevant\u2019 (Stewart and Hills, 2005: 15). Even within the poorer sections of the population\ncertain groups are treated more favourably than others; for example, while the assault on\nchild poverty is to be welcomed and has been relatively successful (Hills, 2004: 234),\nnoting that \u2018projections [suggesting] that relative child poverty may fall by eight or nine\npercentage points between 1997 and 2004\u20135\u2019), low-paid working-age adults without\nchildren have not benefited to the same extent (Sefton and Sutherland, 2005: 247).\nMeanwhile, favoured by low income tax rates and rapidly rising salaries, the incomes of\nthe top 10 per cent (and particularly the top 1 per cent) have continued to rise dramatically.\nHills (2004: 78) reports that, whereas those at the borderline saw their earnings rise from\n1.7 times median earnings in 1971 to 2.1 times in 2001, a gain of 22 per cent over\nthe period, the top-most earners enjoyed an increase from 3.4 times to 6 times median\nearnings, an increase of 75 per cent. While these trends became established during\nthe period of Conservative hegemony, New Labour has done little to alter the situation,\n344\nCreating \u2018Opportunity for All\u2019? New Labour, New Localism and the Opportunity Society\nleading Toynbee and Walker (2005: 30\u20131) to comment that \u2018on Blair\u2019s watch a relatively\nsmall number of people got grotesquely richer\u2019.\nWhere wealth is concerned, there is no evidence of an egalitarian trend since 1997.\nIn fact, Hills (2004: 31) notes that, measured by the Gini co-efficient, inequalities of\nwealth have actually increased since the late 1990s with the top 1 per cent increasing\ntheir share \u2018to 23 per cent of the total, from 17 per cent in 1991\u2019. This share remained\nthe same in 2001 and is \u2018the highest since the UK series [previously GB series] began in\n1976\u2019. Of course, in Blair\u2019s terms, \u2018the issue isn\u2019t in fact whether the very richest person\nends up by becoming richer. The issue is whether the poorest person is given the chance\nthat they otherwise don\u2019t have\u2019 (Newsnight, 2001). The question, however, is what worth\nto put on this chance when the weight of opportunity appears to be skewed so markedly\ntowards the better off.\nThat opportunities are indeed skewed in this way is further illustrated by the fact that\nrecent UK studies indicate that intergenerational mobility remains low (see Marshall et al.,\n1997, Blanden et al., 2005). Discussing a number of measures of mobility, Jackson and\nSegal (2004: 29\u201330) point out that the elasticity of incomes across generations continues\nto favour the better off, while they (Jackson and Segal, 2004: 58) also state that \u2018the odds\nof ending up in the middle class versus ending up in the working class are five to six\ntimes higher for those born into the middle class, compared with those born into the\nworking class\u2019. Research from the DfES (2005) supports this finding, suggesting that the\nlong-term association among academic attainment, social class and income continues\nto persist. Indeed, in primary schools, using free school meals as a proxy measure of\nsocio-economic status, pupil level analysis indicates that, in attainment in English and\nMaths, \u2018the class gap has not narrowed in recent years\u2019 and might have \u2018slightly widened\u2019\n(DfES, 2005: 11\u201312).\nConc lus ion\nIn general terms, this article has drawn attention to the importance of the relationship\nbetween a political party\u2019s public philosophy and the policies designed to achieve the\nvision of social justice it contains. That the relationship is an uneasy one, with some\ninevitable slippage, is perhaps to be expected \u2013 after all, the cut and thrust of daily\npolitics in a rapidly changing social and economic environment will, by definition, make\nit difficult for any government to remain entirely faithful to an understanding of social\njustice, which in New Labour\u2019s case was largely established before the Party came to\noffice in 1997. The real difficulty identified here though concerns the current social\npolicy mix and, specifically, the apparent belief that targeted policies alone can lead to\na much wider condition of social inclusion and the \u2018opportunity society\u2019. Although a\n\u2018strategy\u2019 of this kind can certainly produce benefits for (some) disadvantaged groups in\n(some) areas, as Deacon (2003) has noted in relation to New Labour\u2019s efforts to break\n\u2018the cycle of disadvantage\u2019, it is hard to see how it can lead to genuine opportunity\nfor all in the absence of a stronger commitment to redistributive justice of the kind\nthat the government appears reluctant to endorse. Two rather different dangers are\ninvolved in mortgaging political principle in this way. First, as argued above, if they are\nallowed to retain the fruits of very high earnings and permitted to accumulate and retain\nlarge concentrations of wealth, better-off groups will always enjoy greater opportunities\nthan poorer sections of society, thereby negating any chance of establishing more\n345\nNick Ellison and Sarah Ellison\nequal access to opportunities overall. Second, to ignore the logic of stated principle\nopens up the risk that policy could become merely pragmatic. If \u2018third way\u2019 social\npolicies have always had a necessary hint of pragmatism about them, this makes\nit all the more important that consistent critical engagement with the policy\u2013public\nphilosophy relationship keeps them attached to principle. To escape principle too\ncompletely obviously reduces the power and scope of socio-political vision, and means\nthat policies will increasingly be justified on the narrowly conceived basis of \u2018what works\u2019.\nRefe rences\nAspden, J. and Birch, D.
