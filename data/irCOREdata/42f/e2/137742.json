The problems are experienced in autumn\/winter \nwhen the colour increases and the WTW becomes overloaded. However the DOC \ncontent of the water varies little throughout the year.  To investigate this further, the \nwater was fractionated using resin adsorption techniques into its hydrophobic (fulvic \nand humic acid fractions) and hydrophilic (acid and non-acid fractions) components.  \nThe fractionation process yields useful information on the changing concentration of \neach fraction but is time consuming and labour intensive.  Here, a method of rapidly \ndetermining fraction concentration was developed using fluorescence spectroscopy. \nThe model created used synchronous spectra of fractionated material compared \nagainst bulk water spectra and predicted the fraction concentrations to within 10% for \na specific water.   The model was unable to predict fraction concentrations for waters \nfrom a different watershed. \n \n 3\nIntroduction \nThe fractionation of dissolved natural organic matter (NOM) from raw waters is \ntypically undertaken using macroporous non-ionic resins (Goslan, E. H. et al., 2002) \nwhere it is separated into its hydrophobic acid (humic and fulvic acid) fraction as well \nas hydrophilic acid and non-acid fractions.  The fractionation provides useful \ninformation compared to bulk water parameters but is time consuming and labour \nintensive.   \nA number of water treatment works (WTW) in the North of England (UK) have \nrecently been experiencing problems reducing the level of disinfection by-product \n(DBP) precursors, such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), to a suitably low level at \ncertain times of the year.  This occurs when there is an increase in the hydrophobic \nacid fraction, specifically the fulvic acid fraction (FAF).  It would therefore be useful \nif the DOC distribution could be determined rapidly, without the use of resin \nfractionation, in order to determine an increase in the FAF.  Fluorescence \nspectroscopy is proposed as such a method. \nFluorescence spectra are usually obtained either by analysing the intensity of emitted \nlight as a function of its excitation wavelength (emission spectra) or by analysing the \nintensity of light emitted at a fixed wavelength whilst scanning the wavelength of \nexcitation (excitation spectra). When both the excitation and emission wavelengths \nare scanned simultaneously but the difference between them is kept constant, the \nresulting spectrum is a synchronous spectrum (Crou\u00e9, J.-P. et al., 2000).  The data \nfrom the synchronous scan can be represented as an excitation-emission matrix \n(EEM) which provides highly detailed information that can be used to identify \nfluorescent compounds present in complex mixtures.  Synchronous spectroscopy \nprovides new information compared to a single scan. The wavelength independent \n 4\nfluorescence maximum (Exmax\/Emmax) is not dependent on the wavelength at which \nfluorescence was stimulated or at which emission was observed because it represents \nthe one combination which results in maximum fluorescence (Coble, P., 1996). \nPrevious work, in the field of fluorescence spectroscopy for characterisation of \norganic matter, (Coble, P., 1996, Smith, D. S. and Kramer, J. R., 1999) has \nestablished that humic substances typically fluoresce in the excitation range of ~300 \u2013 \n400 nm and the emission range of ~400 \u2013 500 nm. \nDue to the relative ease and high sensitivity of optical techniques, numerous studies \nhave examined their potential for determining the DOC content of natural waters \n(Senesi, N., 1990, Ferrari, G. M. et al., 1996, Mittenzwey, K. H. et al,, 1996, Skoog, \nA.  and Wedborg, M., 1996, Hautaula, K. et al., 2000). With higher resolution \nspectrometers, and the ability to acquire complete absorption and emission spectra, \nadvances have been made in characterising the source dependent spectral variations of \ndissolved organic matter (Green, S. A. and Blough, N. V., 1994).  Synchronous \nfluorescence spectroscopy has also been successfully used to distinguish between \nhumic substances isolated from soil and water (Senesi, N. et al., 1989, Patterson H. H. \net al., 1992, Pullin, M. J. and Cabaniss, S. E., 1995, Mobed, J. J. et al., 1996, Da \nSilva, J. C. G. E. and Machado, A. A. S. C., 1997).  More recently a method has been \nproposed by Marhaba, T. F. et al. (2000) that can rapidly identify organic matter \nfraction concentrations in a water using Spectral Fluorescent Signatures. \nIn this paper, we have carried out a study to investigate the use of fluorescence \nspectroscopy as a technique for rapidly determining the concentration of fractions in \nraw water as an alternative to the traditional resin separation technique.  The Spectral \nFluorescent Signatures (SFS) technique (Marhaba, T. F. et al., 2000) was investigated \nbefore developing the method described here. \n 5\nMaterials and Methods \nWater samples (raw water) were collected from the reservoir inlet at Albert WTW in \nthe Yorkshire Water region in the UK in November 2000, November 2001 and April \n2002. Water samples were collected from the reservoir inlet at Rivington WTW in the \nUnited Utilities Water region in the UK in April 2001.  The parameters of each raw \nwater are reported (Table 1). \nThe raw water was fractionated by XAD resin adsorption techniques into its \nhydrophobic acid (HPOA) and hydrophilic acid (HPIA) fractions using an adapted \nmethod (Malcolm, R. L. and MacCarthy, P., 1992) that has been described previously \n(Goslan, E. H.  et al., 2002). The HPOA fraction was further separated into its humic \nacid fraction (HAF) and fulvic acid fraction (FAF) by precipitation of the HAF at pH \n1.  Non-adsorbed material was designated the name hydrophilic non-acid fraction \n(HPINA).  The denaturing of the DOC in the water samples, due to the acid and \nalkaline conditions used in the fractionation, has been previously discussed (Goslan, \nE. H. et al., 2002). \nDissolved organic carbon (DOC) measurements were used to determine fraction \nconcentrations. Here, the DOC is defined as the organic carbon that passes through a \n0.45 \u00b5m filter.  DOC was measured using a Shimadzu TOC-5000A analyser (Milton \nKeynes, UK).   \nFluorescence measurements were carried out using a Varian Cary Eclipse \nSpectrophotometer (Middelburg, The Netherlands).  The raw water fractions were \ndiluted to concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 mg L-1 (as well as 0.5 and \n0.7 mg L-1 for the FAF) using deionised water.  The pH of each sample was adjusted \nto 7.  A synchronous scan was carried out on each sample at each dilution.  As with \nthe Spectral Fluorescent Signatures technique (Marhaba, T. F. et al., 2000), this \n 6\ninvolved exciting each sample from 225 to 525 nm.  At each excitation level, \nemission was recorded from excitation + 24 nm to 633 nm.  An optimal stepwise \nincrement of 12 nm was used for both excitation and emission measurements. For \neach sample an excitation-emission matrix (EEM) was produced.  Good spectroscopic \npractice was exercised throughout the study. \n \n 7\nResults and Discussion \nFluorescence of DOC fractions \nThe total luminescence spectra for each of the four DOC fractions at 1 mg L-1 DOC \nwas studied in the form of excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) (Figures 2 to 5).  The \nFAF and HPIA EEMs showed a bimodal peak distribution indicating the presence of \ntwo main fluorophores in the macromolecular structure of the dissolved NOM.  The \nHAF EEM had four distinct peaks.  The HPINA EEM showed a trimodal distribution \nwith much lower intensity of fluorescence being exhibited when compared with the \nother fractions.  Wavelength pair values for the two major peaks exhibited by each \nfraction are reported in Table 2 alongside literature values.  \nPrevious analysis of the fractions by High Pressure Size Exclusion Chromatography  \nhas shown that the FAF contains smaller molecules than the HAF (Parsons, S. A. et \nal., 2002).  The stronger intensity of fluorescence exhibited by the FAF (Figure 2), \nwhen compared to the HAF (Figure 3) (in the excitation area 300 - 350 nm), indicated \nthat smaller sized molecules fluoresce more strongly per mass of carbon.  This could \nbe as a result of more efficient energy transfer through internal conversions in the \nlarger molecules (Alberts, J. J. et al., 2000). The presence of a variety of fluorescent \nstructures has been reported as being indigenous in the fulvic macromolecule.  These \ninclude condensed aromatic moieties bearing various functional groups and \nunsaturated aliphatic chains (Senesi, N., 1990). \nIn the literature, wavelength pairs at 278\/353 (excitation\/emission (nm)) have been \nreported for protein-like substances and at 337\/423 (ex\/em (nm)) for fulvic-like \nsubstances (Her, N. et al., 2001).  A faint peak is observed in the protein-like region \nin the HAF EEM at 280\/325 (ex\/em (nm)) (Figure 3).  Fulvic acid has also been \n 8\nreported to fluoresce in the range 290-340\/380-430 (ex\/em (nm) (Baker, A. and \nGenty, D., 2001). Wavelength pairs have been reported for humic-like substances at \n310\/423 (ex\/em (nm)) (Coble, P., 1996).   These reported values agree with those \nobserved for the Albert Reservoir fractions (Table 2).   \nIt has been reported by Baker, A. and Lamont-Black, J. (2001) that after the first flush \nof the hydrological year in the UK (in autumn), fluorescent dissolved organic matter \n(DOM) had a lower emission wavelength than the annual mean.  Furthermore, a \nsecond (late winter) organic matter flush comprised fluorescent DOM that had a lower \nexcitation wavelength than the annual mean.  The fact that the samples investigated \nhere were taken in November (autumn\/winter) could explain the blue shift (shorter \nwavelengths) in the excitation wavelengths observed for the fulvic- and humic-like \nfluorescence when compared with other values found in the literature (Alberts, J. J. et \nal., 2000, Miano, T. M. and Alberts, J. J., 1999).   \nMarhaba, T. F. et al. (2000) have reported wavelength pairs for hydrophilic acids in \nthe literature.  The first wavelength pair in the HPIA EEM at 318\/424 (ex\/em (nm)) \n(Figure 4) is in the region of fulvic-like fluorescence but the intensity of fluorescence \nis much lower than the FAF perhaps indicating less aromaticity and less saturation in \nthe HPIA.  \nThe wavelengths in the first pair shift towards shorter wavelengths for the HPINA \nfraction signifying a smaller nominal molecular size when compared with the other \nfractions.  The lower intensity of fluorescence indicates a lower degree of aromaticity \nfor the HPINA fraction when compared to the other fractions.  A peak for carboxylic \nacids at 310\/400 (ex\/em (nm)) was identified in the literature (Alberts, J. J. et al., \n2000). A peak is observed in this region in the HPINA fraction EEM (Figure 5).  This \n 9\npeak at 310\/400 (ex\/em (nm) is also said to be representative of small nitrogen \ncontaining compounds (Alberts, J. J. et al., 2000). \n \nModel Development \nWhen analysing fluorescence spectra, the position of peaks on the EEM that exhibit \nmaximum intensity values are investigated.  Typically, an EEM for a sample \ncontaining NOM will exhibit two main peaks.  The position of these peaks gives \ninformation on the types of molecules present.  Marhaba. T. F. et al. (2000) found that \nthe areas of maximum intensity of fluorescence were shown to be representative of \nthe concentration of each fraction.   The region of the EEMs investigated in the SFS \ntechnique was maximum intensity values in the 225 \u2013 249 nm excitation region \n(Figure 1).  Figure 1 is a collation of maximum intensity values reported in the \nliterature, as well as maximum intensity values found in this study, in the form of an \nEEM. \nAnother study has reported two intensity maxima observed in each EEM (Coble, P., \n1996).  One from excitation at the shortest wavelength used (in this case ~260 nm) \nand another from excitation in the region 300 \u2013 370 nm. The author found it difficult \nto determine the actual position and shape of the first maxima as the observations only \nextended to 260 nm.  This peak on the edge of the EEM has been previously \ndisregarded (Coble, P., 1996).   \nIt is this peak at the limit of observation that Marhaba, T. F. et al. (2000) proposed as \nbeing representative of the organic matter in the sample.  In a different study the two \npeaks observed were referred to as fluorescent pairs that were shown on the EEM as a \nbimodal peak distribution (Alberts, J. J. et al., 2000).  In that study the second of the \npairs was again at the edge of the observed excitation range. Here, the authors \n 10\nsimplified the spectra by taking the second derivative of the entire spectra to create \nfour peaks.  The chemical identity of this peak has been reported as unknown but \ntypical for aquatic NOM (Blaser, P. et al., 1999). Another study attributes the region \nof fluorescence at 230-280\/310-420 (excitation\/emission (nm)) to a single fluorophore \nsuch as a protein although it is acknowledged that fluorescence at this excitation \nwavelength is poorly understood (Baker, A. and Lamont-Black, J., 2001).  In the \nliterature, the peaks observed at the limit of observation have been either disregarded \nor derived to create new data.  Only Marhaba, T. F. et al. (2000) have used the data as \nit stands. \n \nExcitation-emission matrices (EEMs) were produced for all the fractions at varying \nconcentrations. The data from each synchronous scan was saved in a database.  Each \nEEM exhibited at least two major areas of fluorescence.  As with the SFS technique \n(Marhaba, T. F. et al., 2000), we took the region of highest intensity of fluorescence \nas being representative of each fraction. However, it was found that the information \ncontained in this area could not help to determine fraction concentration, as the peak \nwas too close to the edge of the observations made. \nWe then looked at the region of organic matter fluorescence (excitation 300-350 \nnm\/emission 300-500 nm) as being representative of each fraction.  It was found \nthrough trial and error that the emission spectrum of raw water at the excitation \nwavelength of 311 nm was approximately equal to the sum of the emission spectra of \neach of the fractions at 311 nm given that one fraction had a predominant \nconcentration.  311 nm was the average excitation wavelength for the second maxima \nof all the fractions measured.  The predominant fraction was determined by resin \nfractionation. \n 11\n \nA Microsoft Excel macro was created to process the data. The steps followed by the \nmacro are illustrated in Figure 6.   \nStep 1: Once a synchronous scan of the raw water was carried out, the emission \nspectra at ex = 311 nm was extracted. \nStep 2: The predominant fraction spectra (FAF) at different concentrations was \ncompared against Figure 6 (a) until the concentration that matched the raw water \nspectra most closely was found (Figure 6 (b)).  The closest spectra will be where the \nsquared difference between the spectra is closest to zero. \nStep 3: Now the concentration of the predominant fraction was established.  To \ndetermine the concentration of the remaining three fractions, the spectra for the \nremaining fraction at each concentration were added to it in all possible combinations \nuntil a combination was found that was closest to the raw water spectra (Figure 6 (c)). \nAs there are three remaining fractions at six different concentrations, there are 63 \ncombinations. \n \nInitial Testing of Model on Synthetic Waters \nThe model was tested on Albert raw water sampled in November 2000.  The results \nare shown in a table that compares the real values as determined from the resin \nfractionation with the values predicted using the model (Table 3).  A close match was \nexpected as the fractions from this water were used to produce the fraction data for \nthe database.   \nThe model was tested on samples A to C that were artificially created from solutions \nof the isolated fractions.  Theses synthetic waters were made to test the model on \nHAF and FAF rich waters.  Table 4 shows the real proportion of each fraction in the \n 12\nsamples for analysis compared to the fraction concentrations predicted using the \nmodel.  \nWith sample A, the predicted results are within \u00b1 3 % of the \u2018real values\u2019 for all \nfractions.  The predicted results are expected to be very close to the real results as \nsample A was made with the same proportions as the November raw water (2000) that \nwas used to create the database.  With sample B, the predicted results are within \u00b1 4 \n% of the real values.  With sample B, the principal fraction is the HAF.  This shows \nthat even when the principal fraction is changed, the method gives an accurate result.  \nSample C is accurate to \u00b1 9 %.  With sample C, the FAF concentration was \nunderestimated by the model thus leading to an overestimation of the other fraction \nconcentrations. \nSynthetic waters with a hydrophilic fraction as the principal fraction were not made as \nthe water from Albert Reservoir has been shown to be mainly hydrophobic throughout \nthe year (Goslan, E. H. et al., 2002). It is also thought that the prediction of \nhydrophilic fraction (HPIA and HPINA) concentrations may be less accurate due to \ntheir lower intensity of fluorescence when compared with the more hydrophobic \nfractions (FAF and HAF). \n \nTesting of Model on Natural Waters \nThe model was tested on Albert raw water taken in November 2001.  The results are \nshown in a table (Table 3) that compares the real values as determined from the resin \nfractionation with the values predicted using the model.  \nThe results from the model are very close to the results determined by resin \nfractionation for the FAF and HAF (\u00b1 2%) but are less accurate for the more \n 13\nhydrophilic fractions (\u00b1 6%).  This could be attributed to the lower intensity of \nfluorescence exhibited by the more hydrophilic fractions.  The method was tested \nfurther on Albert raw water, this time taken in April 2002.  The results are shown \n(Table 3).  The results here are less accurate (\u00b1 8%) than observed with the water \nsampled in November.  It has been reported that the position of the excitation and \nemission maxima will change seasonally (Baker, A. and Lamont-Black, J., 2001).  \nThis could account for the less accurate results found when analysing water from \nApril with a database set up using November water. \n \nUse of the Model on Other Watersheds \nThe model was tested on raw water from Rivington WTW in the North West of \nEngland.  The results are shown (Table 3).  With an error of >25% for the HAF, the \nresults show that the model is unable to predict the concentration of fractions for a \nwater that has not been used to create the fraction database.  Therefore, for the model \nto work on a different water, a fraction database for that water would need to be set \nup.  This would involve resin fractionation followed by a synchronous scan of each \nfraction at varying concentrations to produce the fraction database.   \n \nPractical use of the model \nThe objective of this study was to determine if the seasonal change in DOC \nconcentration and character could be determined rapidly and accurately using \nfluorescence spectroscopy in order that treatment can be adapted accordingly.  \nSeasonal changes in the nature of DOC can have significant impact on water \ntreatment processes. There is therefore a need to characterise the nature of the organic \nmatter entering a treatment works.  Whilst methods such as HPSEC can fingerprint \n 14\norganic material it does not provide the same level of information on treatability as \nknowing the fraction distribution.  Traditional resin fractionation methods are time \nconsuming and labour intensive.  Even if clean resin is available it will take many \ndays to determine the fraction distribution.  By using the model it is possible to \npredict sudden changes in DOC distribution within an hour which means that \ntreatment at the WTW can be adapted to cope.  The information gleaned through \nfractionation confirms the need to consider DOC as a complex mixture of organics \nrather than a bulk parameter (Goslan, E. H. et al., 2002).   \n \nConclusions \n\u2022 The model described here can be used for a specific site to rapidly determine \nchanges in the DOC distribution in a raw water. \n\u2022 The model contains a database of fractions at different concentrations for \ncomparison with a raw water sample.   \n\u2022 Compared with resin fractionation which can take many days to determine \nfraction distribution, this model can determine fraction distribution within an hour \n(once the model has been set up for a particular water). \n\u2022 Although the model reported here has shown potential for predicting the \nconcentrations of these fractions, it needs to be validated further with more \nfractionation data.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors would like to express gratitude to Yorkshire Water and United Utilities \nfor sponsoring this work.
