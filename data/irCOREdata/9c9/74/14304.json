One evident area of convergence in education\nhas been the use of the Internet. But according to Gosper et al (1996), the most likely\nstrategies for implementation are to use the Internet as a repository of reference, lecture\nmaterials and the presentation of the lectures. This could imply that the full potential of\ndistributed learning through convergence might never be achieved. How can we implement\ngood learning strategies following sound educational methodologies today, while not\nproducing legacy systems or piecemeal content that could constrain future developments?\nIn making it possible for distributed learning to occur, there are best-practice considera-\ntions applicable to most educational environments.\n41\nMarcel Chabupka andTony Koppi A vignette model for distributed teaching and learning\nThis paper considers the issues associated with distributed learning in the context of the\nrecent history of computer-aided learning developments. Particular problems have arisen\nwith Computer-Based Learning (CBL) materials, such as the lack of uptake of monolithic\nprogrammes that cannot easily be changed to keep pace with natural progress or the differ-\nent requirements of different institutions. The shift in recent emphasis towards the Internet\nhas not resolved these problems which may be more pertinent because of the potentially\nwider field of ever-more discerning users. A solution to monolithic developments is in the\nuse of object-oriented vignettes that can be used to assemble learning materials to suit\nindividual learners (including prior learning and professional development considerations)\nas well as individual teaching preferences. The issues associated with hypertext\/hypermedia\nhave increased in importance with increased use of the Internet. The concept of mimetics,\nfirst-person learning interfaces (as opposed to navigation structures) and interactivity are\nalso no less relevant when designing learning programmes for distribution over the Internet.\nDistributed learning\nRadio, television and mailing of documents and educational software of many flavours\nhave been the main delivery mechanisms that have driven the implementation of distance\nlearning. The Internet is fast becoming a seductive delivery medium. But is distance\nlearning, or learning for that matter, about the ability to deliver learning material rapidly to\na client? The methodologies that have been implemented in distance learning imply a one-\nway flow of information to the client, given that the client may phone, email or mail\nassignments to the course facilitator. This one-way flow of educational material does not\nseem to take advantage of the telecommunications revolution that has been brought about\nby convergent technologies. It seems that educational practice often is incongruent with\nnotional educational theory such as collaboration, peer-to-peer learning, mentoring,\napprenticeship or heuristic models of learning.\nIf what Kveton and Vesela (1996) say (Teachers will become advisors, managers and\nfacilitators of learning rather than providers of information') has any relevance, we need to\nlook at different ways of developing and implementing distance education. Distributed\nlearning addresses the issues of the teachers being advisers, managers and facilitators, and\nthus provides a means by which an educational or training facility can implement a full\ntwo-way educational experience in a divergent market where the location and distribution\nof the teaching resources and participants (students, teachers, etc.) are irrelevant.\nThe model for distributed learning described here takes influences from traditional\nmethodologies of teaching and learning, but before discussion of the model we need to\nlook at the reasons that have led to the model, and why some, perhaps obvious, options\nhave been avoided.\nHypermedia and learner control\nPart of the notion of distributed learning is that students take control and responsibility for\ntheir learning rather than being passive recipients of information. To this end, in a digital\ncontext, hypertext\/hypermedia environments have been touted as eliciting learner control\n(Chung and Reigeluth, 1992) and providing a dynamic, systematic relationship between the\nlearning environment and the learner (Locatis et al, 1989; Wilson and Jonasson 1989).\n42\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\nShin et al (1994) state: 'In a Hypertext environment, use of learner control is inevitable\nbecause hypermedia creates non-sequential, dynamic, and multiple structures of\ninformation that allow the learners with different interests to navigate multiple pathways\nthrough the information'. But how can a collection of static pages on a computer, with\npredefined pathways and schema, automatically and inevitably allow learner control, when\nthe learner is actually involved in the consumption of predefined content through a\nstructure that is no more dynamic or interactive than turning pages in a book? Hypertext is\npassive by nature: the learner may fail to engage with the materials in ways that result in\neffective learning (McKnight et al, 1993). Hypertext\/hypermedia, as the primacy of the\nlearning experience, show that little or no thought has been given to the cognitive aspects\nof interactivity (Laurillard, 1993), leaving the student to become a passive agent to a\nnarrative (Alessi andTrollip 1991; Laurel 1991).\nThus to transfer a book or learning material in its current form into hypertext\/hypermedia\nto be the primacy of the learning experience allows the user only to follow predefined\npathways and does not take full advantage of the technological platform; it is merely\nrepackaging (Diller, 1995). Borsook and Higginbotham-Wheat (1991) indicate that\nsoftware that provides only backward and forward movement in the presentation of\ninformation simply talks or communicates at, not with, the learner in a co-responsive\nmanner. The primacy of the learning experience should be more than having access to or\nlooking at information. Students need, to be enabled to examine, perceive, interpret and\nexperience information thereby converting information into knowledge. Interactive media\nprovide these opportunities only when users can visualize and understand complex\nrelationships in ways that are not possible in other media.\nMonolithic computer-based learning\nThe development of CBL has historically been the development of monolithic learning\napplications, that is, those designed to be self-contained, self-standing and containing large\namounts of information. Many of these CBL applications are based on a tutorial-type\nmethod of content delivery. They may include features such as notepads, calculators and\nreference materials, perhaps to support some activities. In addition, hypertext\/hypermedia\nis a common feature.\nThe primacy of locus of control is commonly that of the interface. The notion of learner-\ncontrol via the navigational interface is an explicit action of the interface. In other words,\nthe student has to learn the interface before learning the information within the\napplication. It would be a more direct relevant experience with the information if learning\nand understanding the interface were part of a process of interacting directly with the\ninformation in a first-person heuristic.\nOther limitations to the development of monolithic CBL include the cost of development,\ntime restrictions of academics contributing to the project, changes after completion, and\nissues of inter-disciplinary replication between disparate developments.\nChanging the content after compilation\nIn the academic world, content (as information) will always need to be modified, appended\nand edited. Also, different experts see the value of content differently: not everyone wants\n43\nMarcel Chabupka and Tony Koppi A vignette model for distributed teaching and learning\nto teach a subject in the same way. Information is evolutionary, and sometimes capricious,\nso developing monolithic CBL for content delivery is perhaps inappropriate. It may help if\nwe could change the primacy of the learning experience to heuristic activities (Koppi and\nChaloupka, 1997) that encourage the student to seek meaning by accessing a variety of\nmedia and informational resources because of a need to do so. The outcome of this could\nbe for the student to have an experience with information (Laurel, 1991), as opposed to the\nstudent merely being presented with information for learning.\nBasic heuristic activities do not need to be changed because of their content transparency,\nbut should be contextually truthful to a first principle concept or process; for example,\nperforming a pH test is based on the same concept whatever the particular disciplinary\nperspective. In this scenario, content, information and the dynamics of information can be\nthought of in term of libraries, that is, a collection of catalogued reference and resource\nmaterials as a support to the activities.\nConsidering content as reference material that can be accessed physically or electronically,\nfrom centralized locations, enables changes to be made by academics and students as well\nas for ongoing professional development.\nWe don't teach it that way\nIt is unlikely that the content within a CBL is not appropriate for the course, as one would\nexpect that the content is an abstraction from one or more experts. Perhaps the 'we don't\nteach it that way' syndrome results from the content not being accessible in a way in which\nthe subject is taught. A course is constructed to utilize a variety of sources and activities,\nfor example reading lists, photocopies of articles and chapters from books, dry labs,\nfieldwork, assignments, discussions and tutorials. The range of experiences and resources\nbetween academics will inherently be different, but there will also be core similarities.\nEach of these resources and experiences on a micro level could be heuristic and learner-\ncentred in nature. The motivation of the teacher should not be to present or give access to\nresources as the primary learning experience, but to give an authentic activity as the\nprimacy of the learning experience which drives the need to seek understanding.\nHistorically, CBL has tended to offer a prescriptive approach to the teaching processes,\nand not to offer a range of teaching heuristics that are usable by individual academics from\ntheir own teaching perspectives and needs. Developers of CBL concentrate on the notion\nof learner-centric CBL, but at the same time tend to be didactic towards teaching the\nteaching process: an all-or-nothing approach. It would seem as if the two notions of\nstudent- and teacher-centric approaches are incompatible.\nVignettes\nA vignette approach may be a solution to the 'we don't teach it that way' issue. This\nrequires changing the perspective of the learning experience from content delivery (in other\nwords, narratives in the third person interlaced with questions of comprehension) to first-\nperson heuristics where the learner is engaged in hypothesis testing and problem-solving in\nthe first person. This is aimed at encouraging the learner to seek the meaning of the\nactivity by purposefully accessing resource or content materials.\n44\nALT-] Volume 6 Number I\nVignettes can be defined as small, first-principle, first-person, heuristic activities (com-\nponents), from which courses are constructed. Vignettes are transparent to content but are\nsupported by reference materials that are accessed electronically, form centralized\nlocations, as separate materials but integrated into the learning environment. Thereby, the\nsupportive resource materials can be added to by a teacher, and edited and contributed to\nby colleagues on an ongoing basis, thus avoiding the 'can I change the content after the\nprogram has been completed?' issue.\nSeparating the vignette activities from the content allows the vignettes to be content-free,\nbut in another sense the vignette activities are content-rich in the relationship of the object\nbehaviour through a contextual interface (rather than a navigation interface). The vignettes\nare then supported by the centralized reference materials which are stored in an\nappropriate domain such a digital library which can be accessed via networked technology\nand can be changed without the need to modify the vignettes.\nA vignette object has inherent behaviour which is not changed by content. For example, a\ntest tube has behaviours: it is made from glass; it can make a clinking sound when struck; it\nis clear; it cannot stand unless supported; it can be broken; things can be put in it. If we were\n\u2022 to write a vignette about a test tube, we would want to put these inherent behaviours into it.\nBut not all the behaviours relevant to a vignette object are relevant to all courses that might\nuse test tubes. This problem can be addressed by allowing the properties of the vignette\nobject to be changed, by turning on and off the available object properties of the vignette\nobject, thus modifying the vignette behaviour to suit the purposes of the user. For instance,\nthe test tube could contain a range of aqueous chemicals but in the course that we are\nconstructing we want only a range of ionic compounds that are soluble in water to be\nvisible. So, by accessing the test-tube property sheet, we could turn off the chemicals we do\nnot want the students to see, while leaving the ionic compounds that are soluble in water and\nthat suit the course agenda. Now we have a test-tube vignette with modifiable object\nbehaviour. Part of the test-tube object behaviour is that it can be filled with chemicals.\nWhen the vignette is activated we see a test tube; if the test tube is clicked on, a list of\navailable chemicals is shown. Clicking on one of the items in the list fills the test tube with a\nchosen item. By itself this is of no use unless we have other vignette objects with which our\ntest-tube vignette object can interact. So, in the course that may be constructed, another\ntest-tube vignette object (a clone of the first) can be activated, together with a beaker\nvignette object to enable mixing of the chemicals. Now we have two test tube objects with,\nsay, aqueous ionic compounds in them, and an empty beaker. The test tubes empty into the\nbeaker; this is what we call the primacy of action. Just like vignette objects have object\nbehaviour, groups of objects can have primacy of action like hammer and nail, stapler and\npaper, test tubes and beakers. There is an inherent behaviour between objects; as each object\nhas its own unique behaviour, groups of vignette objects have group behaviour or action.\nThis group behaviour is hierarchical; for instance, the nail reacts to the hammer. The\nhammer is the dominant object, the action goes from the hammer to the nail. If we\nintroduced wood to the group, the action would transfer from the hammer to the nail to\nthe wood. But let us say that instead of introducing wood we introduced steel to the group.\nIn this scenario we have two objects that are dominant over the nail whose object\nbehaviour is hierarchically higher than that of the nail. The primacy of action would say\nthat the hammer hits the nail and the nail bends on steel, as both the hammer and the steel\n45\nMarcel Chabupka and Tony Koppi A vignette model for distributed teaching and learning\ncan change the behaviour or characteristic of the nail. The beaker like the hammer, nail\nand steel reacts to the primacy of action of the two full test tubes, which fill the beaker, and\na reaction of the two chemicals occurs within the beaker.\nBut vignettes alone do not make an educational experience. Vignettes are but a part of a\nbroader and more comprehensive approach to the delivery of CBL that reflects a teacher\nheuristic. Imagine for a moment that you want to make a course based on these ideas. You\nstart by launching your Computer Management Learning (CML) package and click on\nSearch. You type in the content area of the course you wish to create, let us say Soil\nScience. The search pulls up a list of teaching resources and materials that have been\ncreated all over the world that could be used in teaching Soil Science. Some of these\nresources and materials could be Web discussions, vignettes, reference materials,\nassessments, teaching guides as well as other teacher resources. You click on a vignette and\nit launches. Among other things, a core component of your course is pH. You click on pH\nand a pH vignette launches. The pH vignette does not have a Soil Science look or feel; it\nhas a chemistry feel, but because vignettes are based on the notion of Object-Oriented\nProgramming, they have property sheets. You pull up the property sheet and it allows you\nto change the in-built characteristics of the vignette. For Soil Science, you want to use a tile\nin which samples can be placed. The sample type will be soil, so you change the soil\nproperties to suit the soil types you want the students to examine. The vignette now fits\nyour requirements as a component, so you add it to the course you are constructing. Now\nyou want some supportive resources, and you add some available reference materials to the\ncourse. You also add some peer-to-peer learning as a threaded discussion, as well as some\nassessment components. After you have pooled the educational materials to be used in the\ncourse, you choose the students that will have access to these materials. You add course\nobjectives and a problem-based scenario. While you are making the choices of the core\ncomponents of your course and its members, the CML is constructing a Web page. This\nWeb page is accessible only to the students that have been made members of this course.\nWhen the students log on, they will see the course outline, course objective, problem-based\nscenario, and buttons that launch the vignettes, reference materials, discussion areas, etc.\nThis vignette approach to development allows academics to construct courses in much the\nsame way that is traditionally acceptable. It also allows the vignette to be used in a number\nof situations and applied across disciplines. Thus the program development is a horizontal\nprocess as opposed to a vertical development process which is discipline-based asTepre-\nsented by the monolithic development approach. Because vignettes are single-issue\nfirst-principle activities that can be readily modified, they can be shared between\ndisciplines. For instance, pH is taught in a variety of disciplines including medicine,\nbiology, agriculture and chemistry. A pH vignette could be developed and used in each\ndiscipline by adopting an object-oriented approach to the programming of the application.\nThe vignette object would contain all the contextual information appropriate to the allied\ndisciplines. The pH object is then externally manipulated through its associated property\nsheet. This would enable the course facilitator to manipulate the object's behaviour to that\nof the discipline's perspective. Different objects can be linked to form larger learning\nactivities of greater complexity or visualization.\nOther advantages in a vignette approach to CBL development are: it does not engender\nreplication of similar materials across diverse disciplines; vignettes are cheap and fast to\n46\nALT-) Volume 6 Number I\ndevelop; vignettes have a longer shelf-life than monolithic CBL which has the content\nembedded within the application, and which is inaccessible in a non-linear basis or on a\njust-in-time basis, as well as being unchangeable without reprogramming.\nThis process of vignette development should allow greater penetration and uptake of the\ntechnology by being sensitive to the machinations and needs of academics in a tradi-\ntionally acceptable manner. A vignette-constructed programme should allow the academic\nto access and use the courseware content in a way that reflects the needs of the academic to\nfacilitate and manage their course.\nFor the vignette object to engage the student in a first-person activity, it is important to\nconsider what is meant by a heuristic activity, and this is considered in the next section.\nMimetics\nMimetics is concerned with mimicking the real world to provide experiences similar to real-\nlife where the appropriate set of external conditions exists (Koppi and Chaloupka, 1996).\nComputer games and training simulations use mimetics extensively to give life-like\nexperiences. Volk (1996) says:\nGames themselves are stills based on one or more interactive experiences of explora-\ntion, resource allocation, action and strategy. Creative authors take advantage of\nincreased technological power primarily to heighten the emotional impact of their\ncreations. In nearly 20 years, most of the evolution has been in interface design. Which\nbrings us to the central point: technology is the palette that interactive designers use to\ncreate experiences for other people. Technology is not a goal. The goal is to create a title\nthat delivers the interactive experience the designer wants.\nPresenting information in dramatic from, as an active first-person encounter, provides a\nmeans for comprehending and therefore is a learning activity to encounter information\nitself (Laurel, 1991). So it would seem that activities are important for engaging the student\nin a learning activity where the action and activity evoke thought.\nMimetic worlds provide a realistic context for exploration and heuristic activities, which\nenable the learner to interact and model an environment in the first person. The\ninteractivity provided in these environments can enable learners to construct schemas and\ntest hypotheses against the environment, and see the results of their actions, thus gaining\nexperience, in relatively short time periods. Such environments or work areas reflect the\nprocesses or schema where the behaviour of the objects or environment behaves as\nexpected. As well as giving learner-centric locus of control, this is a key factor in the\nsustained stimulation and motivation of the learner (Alessi and Trollip, 1991). The\nenvironment must be credible to allow a catharsis to occur while permitting a sustained\nengagement of the imagination (Laurel, 1991) and decision-making process. The challenge\nin developing this type of learning environment is to facilitate imaginative immersion that\nenables experiences, learner control and reflective reasoning (Leyland, 1996).\nConclusion\nCourses can be constructed from a vignette model that takes into account the student and\nteacher needs. Vignettes offer a solution to the problems of\/jcourse adoption and\n47\nMarcel Chabupka and Tony Koppi A vignette model for distributed teaching and learning\nmodification. It is also important to see the learning activities as vignettes where the\ninteraction is not cognitively separate from the learning activity. The main reason for this is\nso that the learning approach of discovery and self-motivation enables the learner to seek\nunderstanding and to be able to construct new knowledge based on prior knowledge.\nLearning materials cannot be functionally isolated from an overall teaching and learning\nstrategy. Learning materials themselves cannot be the sole teaching and learning strategy.\nEach is a small piece in the overall strategy of deliverable learning activities, reference,\nsupport, and assessment in an enterprise-wide solution. It is also important to acknow-\nledge that a teacher's teaching locus of control is as important as learner heuristics in the\ndesign, development and deployment of CBL.\nTo enable curiosity, motivation and self-empowerment, it is necessary to provide a heuristic\nlearning environment that is supported by resources and reference materials rather than\nthis content being the primary learning material. The qualities of a heuristic learning\nenvironment include the capacity of the program to be used as a reflective thinking tool,\nfrequency of interaction, range of choices, and significance, that is to say how much the\nchoices really affect the outcomes (Laurel 1986a and b). The purpose is to making learning\nactivities an experience with information where content delivery is not the primacy of the\nlearning experience but the manipulation of an environment so as to have an experience\nwith the information or concepts. Curiosity, empowerment and self-direction are inter-\ndependent, and should not be seen as extraneous to the learning environment as a laminate\nor facade bonded onto content.\nReferences\nAlessi, S.
