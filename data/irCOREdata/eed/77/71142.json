In this study, velocities of E-region HF echoes ob-\nserved by the Stokkseyri HF radar are compared with E\u00d7B\nplasma drifts in the F-region measured by the DMSP satel-\nlites. Events were selected for which the DMSP track pro-\njected to the height of 110 km was almost perpendicular to\nthe central beams of the radar, resulting in a direct compari-\nson of the cross-track component of the E\u00d7B drift and the\nline-of-sight HF velocity. We found that the typical ratio of\nHF velocity to the DMSP drift is \u223c0.35 in a range of DMSP\ndrifts of 0\u20131700 m\/s. It is suggested that E-region HF ve-\nlocities, observed both along the electrojet and at large flow\nangles, are significantly affected by scatter from the bottom\nof the electrojet layer where the irregularity phase velocity is\nexpected to be strongly depressed with respect to the E\u00d7B\nflow.\nKey words. Ionosphere (Ionospheric irregularities; Plasma\nwaves and instabilities; Auroral ionosphere)\n1 Introduction\nThe presence of magnetic field-aligned, wave-like plasma\ndensity irregularities of the meter-decameter scale is an in-\nherent feature of the high-latitude E-region. Such irregu-\nlarities are believed to be created by the Farley-Buneman\n(FB) and gradient-drift (GD) plasma instabilities at electro-\njet heights (Fejer and Kelley, 1980). The irregularities are\nroutinely detected by VHF and HF coherent radars in those\nparts of the high-latitude ionosphere where the radio waves\npropagate almost perpendicular to the Earth\u2019s magnetic field\nlines.\nAccording to the linear theory of the FB and GD insta-\nbilities, the velocity of plasma irregularities is, to a first\napproximation,VE \u00b7 cos \u03b8 , where VE is theE\u00d7B plasma drift\n(velocity of the electron motion at the electrojet heights) and\n\u03b8 is the flow angle between the electron velocity vector and\nCorrespondence to: A. V. Koustov\n(sasha.koustov@usask.ca)\nthe direction of the irregularities\u2019 propagation. This expecta-\ntion has been widely used for plasma convection monitoring\nin VHF experiments, for example, in the STARE experiment\n(Greenwald et al., 1978; Nielsen and Schlegel, 1985). For\nthe success of the convection estimates, it is fundamentally\nimportant that the velocity magnitude is proportional to VE\nand varies as a cosine function of the flow angle.\nVHF observations show, however, that the relationship be-\ntween the velocity of electrojet irregularities and the E\u00d7B\nplasma drift is more complicated, especially for the con-\ndition of strong plasma flows of VE>Cs (where Cs is the\nion-acoustic speed, roughly 400 m\/s) when the FB instabil-\nity is the prime factor controlling the irregularity production.\nNonlinear theories predict that the phase velocity of the FB-\nrelated irregularities is close to the ion-acoustic speed within\na relatively broad cone of flow angles determined from the\nequation cos \u03b8\u2217=Cs\/VE (Fejer and Kelley, 1980; Nielsen\nand Schlegel, 1985). This property is often referred to as\nthe \u201cCs saturation\u201d of the irregularity velocity (Nielsen and\nSchlegel, 1985). Outside the FB instability cone, it is be-\nlieved (e.g. Nielsen and Schlegel, 1985) that the irregularities\n(sometimes called the secondary irregularities) move with\nthe velocityVE \u00b7 cos \u03b8 , as prescribed by the linear theory.\nPrevious VHF observations showed that indeed the veloc-\nity of echoes observed within the FB instability cone is close\nto Cs , typically slightly above it (e.g. Nielsen et al., 2002).\nSimilar results were obtained at UHF (Foster and Erickson,\n2000).\nVHF observations at large flow angles, outside the FB in-\nstability cone, are somewhat controversial. Evidences have\nbeen presented that the line-of-sight (l-o-s) velocity is, to\na first approximation, the cosine component of the E\u00d7B\nplasma drift (Reinleitner and Nielsen, 1985; Nielsen et al.,\n2002), especially at 50 MHz (Ecklund et al., 1977). How-\never, Kustov and Haldoupis (1992) published STARE data\nfor large flow angles indicating that the l-o-s velocity can be\n10\u201320% smaller than the plasma drift component along the\nbeam. This velocity \u201cdepression\u201d was attributed to the aspect\nangle effect.\n372 A. V. Koustov et al.: The velocity of E-region HF echoes and E\u00d7B plasma drift\nFig. 1. The field-of-view of the Stokkseyri SuperDARN radar at\nranges 180\u20131260 km. Each dot represents the location of the begin-\nning of a radar cell. The height of 110 km is assumed. The thin lines\nare the zero aspect angles of observations for various electron den-\nsities in the ionosphere (densities are shown in units of 1010 m\u22123)\nat 110 km and the radar frequency of 12 MHz. The thick lines are\nthe AACGM magnetic latitudes of 65\u25e6, 70\u25e6, and 75\u25e6.\nSuch interpretation is consistent with the generally ac-\ncepted notion that the VHF velocity is aspect-angle sen-\nsitive, implying that the expected l-o-s velocity at certain\nradar direction cannot be computed by simple multiplica-\ntion of VE and the cosine of the flow angle (e.g. Ogawa et\nal., 1982; Nielsen, 1986; Kustov et al., 1994; Kustov et al.,\n1997). More recently, Koustov et al. (2002) reported an even\nstronger STARE velocity depression, though the effect might\nbe attributed to the shorter pulse separation in the modified\nSTARE system.\nThe relationship between the velocity of HF coherent\nechoes and the E\u00d7B plasma drift has been less investigated\nthan at VHF\/UHF. The major problem is the significant diffi-\nculty of obtaining concurrent data; one needs an HF radar ca-\npable of detecting echoes over an area where the E\u00d7B vec-\ntor is monitored continuously by an independent instrument.\nOne such instrument can be incoherent scatter radar. One\nmight think that the currently existing chain of SuperDARN\nHF radars (Greenwald et al., 1995) should provide ample\ndata to work with. However, appropriate data can only be\ncollected in a short-range viewing zone of the Hankasalmi-\nFinland radar over the CP-1 spot of the incoherent scatter\nradar EISCAT. In addition, the analysis of Hankasalmi data\nindicates that the majority of echoes over the EISCAT CP-1\nspot come from the F-region (e.g. Davies et al., 1999; Dan-\nskin et al., 2002). A limited EISCAT-Hankasalmi E-region\nHF velocity comparison by Davies et al. (1999) showed that\nthe l-o-s velocities were typically smaller than theE\u00d7B flow\ncomponents. Unfortunately, no information on the flow an-\ngle of observations was provided.\nE-region HF radar observations alone, without comple-\nmentary E\u00d7B measurements, are somewhat contradictory.\nAt small flow angles (presumably within the FB instabil-\nity cone), from one side, a clear statistical clustering of\nHF velocities near 400 m\/s (typical Cs value) was reported\n(Hanuise et al., 1991; Milan and Lester, 2001). On the\nother hand, large velocities of more than 700 m\/s are not rare\n(Milan and Lester, 1998; 2001) and strong velocity change\nwith the flow angle within the FB instability cone has been\nreported (Milan and Lester, 2001; Uspensky et al., 2001;\nMakarevitch et al., 2002b). We should note that the veloc-\nity variation with flow angle inside the FB instability cone\nwas recently reported for the STARE radars (Nielsen et al.,\n2002).\nAt large flow angles of HF observations, Koustov et\nal. (2002) and Makarevitch et al. (2004) presented evidence\nfrom indirect measurements that the velocity of E-region HF\nechoes is significantly smaller than the E\u00d7B component.\nThese results seem to disagree with the ones reported by Jay-\nachandran et al. (2000), who compared DMSP ion drift mea-\nsurements and Saskatoon HF data for observations at large\nflow angles and concluded that the HF velocity does indeed\ncorrespond to the DMSP drift.\nIn this study we continue the investigation of the relation-\nship between the Doppler velocity of E-region HF echoes\nand E\u00d7B plasma drifts by considering the Stokkseyri HF\nradar measurements and DMSP ion drifts. The Stokkseyri\nobservations were selected for a simple reason that as the\nDMSP satellites cross this radar field-of-view (FoV), their\ncross-track directions are almost a perfect match to some of\nthe radar beam orientations. Thus, a direct comparison of\nthe E\u00d7B component and the radar l-o-s velocity can be per-\nformed without invoking the assumption that the irregularity\nvelocity changes with the flow angle according to the cosine\nrule.\n2 Experiment configuration and data selection\nStokkseyri SuperDARN data from the standard mode of op-\neration (scanning from beam 15 to beam 0 in one\/two min-\nutes) were used in this study. The raw data set consisted\nof power, velocity and width estimated according to the\nFITACF procedure (Villain et al., 1987; Greenwald et al.,\n1995). For the selection of pure E-region events, several\nconditions were considered, as often the HF echoes were ob-\nserved as a broad \u201cblob\u201d extending from 300 to >800 km.\nFigure 1 shows the FoV of the Stokkseyri radar for ranges\n180\u20131260 km. Each individual dot represents the beginning\nof a radar cell at a height of 110 km. We also show the lines\nof zero aspect angles at a height of 110 km and for electron\ndensities (Ne) of 3.5, 5.0 and 10.0\u00d71010 m\u22123 (at this height)\nwith the assumption of a uniform density over the FoV.\nCalculations were performed for the radar frequency of\n12 MHz using a simple geometry-optical approach for a\nA. V. Koustov et al.: The velocity of E-region HF echoes and E\u00d7B plasma drift 373\nspherical case (Uspensky et al., 1994). The IGRF-99 mag-\nnetic field model was adopted.\nFor densities below \u223c2\u00d71010 m\u22123, zero aspect angles\ncannot be achieved anywhere within the Stokkseyri FoV, and\none would not expect E-region echoes. For a slightly denser\nionosphere, for example, at Ne=3.5\u00d71010 m\u22123, two separate\nregions of the perfect aspect angle are present, in the far\nsouthern and far northern parts of the FoV. The far southern\nline is unusual; normally one would not have it (for exam-\nple, see the STARE aspect angle lines in Greenwald et al.,\n1978). The new line originates from a special configuration\nof the Earth\u2019s magnetic field over Greenland and refraction\ndue to the use of HF frequency of 12 MHz. For stronger den-\nsities, the zero aspect angle lines change their appearance;\nthey cross the FoV in a more east-west direction. With a\nfurther density increase, the lines move closer to the radar\nlocation and their elongation becomes more and more devi-\nated from the L shell directions. This should give a special\nappearance of the echo bands in terms of power. For exam-\nple, for Ne\u223c10\u00d71010 m\u22123, one would expect the backscatter\nat ranges \u223c400 km and it should be stretched from south-\nwest to north-east at an angle of \u223c30\u25e6 with the magnetic L-\nshells. In addition, because the range of perfect aspect is less\nin larger number beams, one would expect the power to be\nstronger in those beams.\nAn important implication of the aspect angle configuration\nwithin the Stokkseyri FoV is that generally one can expect\nE-region echoes at any range (180\u20131200 km) but for typical\ndensities of Ne\u223c10\u00d71010 m\u22123 they should be at close ranges\nof 300\u2013500 km stretched from south-west to north-east with\nstronger power in high number beams. This feature was used\nas one of the criteria for the identification of E-region events.\nAnother criterion for the event selection was that the echo\nregion should not be very broad since the aspect sensitiv-\nity of E-region echoes should confine the echoes to limited\nbands. For some events, the echoes were quite extended, but\nthe Doppler velocity maps clearly indicated that the far edge\nof the echo region had a very different velocity, hinting that\nthese are F-region echoes at these ranges (see example in\nMakarevitch et al., 2004). Finally, for many events, addi-\ntional confirmation that these were indeed E-region echoes\ncomes from the simultaneous detection of F-region echoes\nor ground scatter at appropriate ranges, similar to Milan and\nLester (1998).\nIdentification of E-region echoes was an important part of\nthe work but the final and the most crucial step in the event\nselection was the consideration of concurrent DMSP ion drift\nmeasurements. The south-west to north-east orientation of\nthe E-region echo bands for the Stokkseyri radar dictates that\nthe DMSP trajectories have to pass the Stokkseyri FoV at\nshort ranges roughly along these orientations to enable a di-\nrect comparison of the radar velocities and the E\u00d7B flow.\nFigure 2 gives an example of the Stokkseyri velocity ob-\nservations on 3 November 2002 at 12:52\u201312:53 UT. Two\n\u201cblobs\u201d of high-velocity echoes are evident with one at short\nranges, E-region echoes, and the other one at far ranges, F-\nregion echoes. Even though the echo blobs occur at about the\nFig. 2. The Stokkseyri velocity map at 12:52\u201312:53 UT on 3\nNovember 2002 and DMSP cross-track ion drifts along the satel-\nlite pass over the radar field-of-view.\nsame magnetic latitudes, the F-region velocities are at least\ntwo times larger than the E-region ones.\nAlso shown in Fig. 2 is the trajectory of the DMSP\nF15 satellite and the measured cross-track E\u00d7B ion drift.\nThe DMSP measurements were performed at a height of\n\u223c840 km; the track shown in Fig. 2 is the projection of the\nsatellite location along the magnetic flux lines to a height\nof 110 km. Such a projection was done to facilitate a direct\ncomparison of the DMSP drifts and the Stokkseyri l-o-s ve-\nlocities. For the projection, the magnetic coordinates of the\nsatellite location were traced down along the same flux line\naccording to the ACCGM model. It was assumed that the\nelectric field does not change with height.\nIn Fig. 2 one can notice that the DMSP drifts are com-\nparable in their magnitude with the Stokkseyri far-range F-\nregion velocities (beyond 1500 km) and they are definitely\nlarger than the velocities of the short-range E-region echoes.\nFrom Fig. 2, it is clear that as the satellite travels (to lower\nlatitudes), it crosses some radar beams at almost 90\u25e6 angles.\nThis is an important requirement for the present work, since\nthe DMSP ion drift measurements along the satellite path\nare not as reliable as those across the cross-track. The az-\nimuth difference between the DMSP direction of measure-\nments and the Stokkseyri radar beam were computed so that\na comparison at various orientations between the radar beams\nand the cross-track directions was possible to perform. Sim-\nilar geometry of the SuperDARN\/DMSP measurements was\nsought for other SuperDARN radars but it turned out that\nonly the Stokkseyri and Syowa-East radars were satisfactory.\nIn this study we consider only the Stokkseyri measurements.\nLimited analysis of the Syowa-East data supports the major\nconclusions drawn from the Stokkseyri observations but the\nevent selection is more problematic there because the aspect\nangle conditions lead to the formation of very narrow bands\nof E-region echoes, so that common data are infrequent. In\naddition, the separation between the E- and F-region scatter\ncases is more difficult as joint measurements occur at larger\nflow angles.\n374 A. V. Koustov et al.: The velocity of E-region HF echoes and E\u00d7B plasma drift\nFig. 3. A scheme illustrating the principle of DMSP ion drift data\naveraging for the comparison with the SuperDARN line-of-sight ve-\nlocities.\nIt is important to note that DMSP passes over the\nStokkseyri field-of-view were found to occur in between\n08:00 UT and 13:00 UT which corresponds to the prenoon\n(07:00\u201312:00) MLT sector. This is not the best time for de-\ntection of E-region HF echoes as they are more frequent dur-\ning the evening hours and nighttime (Milan et al., 1997; Dan-\nskin et al., 2002).\nFigure 3 illustrates our approach to the data comparison.\nWe used 4-s averaged DMSP ion drifts corresponding to the\nspatial resolution of \u223c30 km. The Stokkseyri data were inte-\ngrated (by the radar design) over \u223c3 s (1-min scans) or \u223c7 s\n(2-min scans) at every beam position and for every 45-km\nrange cell. There was no exact correspondence of the satellite\nand radar measurements either in terms of time or in terms\nof location. To minimize temporal differences, we consid-\nered only one Stokkseyri scan that corresponded to the time\nof DMSP crossing the radar\u2019s central beams. Spatially, each\nradar cell was associated with 3 measurements of the DMSP\nthat were less than 40 km away from the radar point. For the\ncomparison, the average DMSP ion drift at these sequential\nmeasurements along the track was used.\nOriginally, over 60 passes with proper trajectory orienta-\ntion were located for observations in 1999\u20132002 (the period\nfor which the DMSP drift-meter data were accessible to us).\nOut of these, about half of the passes were not considered for\nfurther assessment for a variety of reasons. For some events,\nthe DMSP data were not continuous or had high variabil-\nity. Besides concerns about the quality of the DMSP data,\nsuch cases might indicate the patchiness of the ionosphere,\nand comparison with HF data would not make sense since\nthe obtained discrepancies could be explained by spatial and\ntemporal differences in measurements. Some events were ex-\ncluded from consideration on the basis of the quality of the\nFig. 4. The line-of-sight Stokkseyri velocity versus DMSP ion drift\nwhen the deviation between the radar and satellite directions of\nmeasurements were less than 5\u25e6 and the differences in time were\nless than 2 min.\nradar data; for these the DMSP measurements corresponded\nto the radar cells just at the edge of the echo band, either at\nshort or far ranges. After this thorough selection, 29 events\nof reasonable quality were entered into the data base. We\nshould note that the DMSP\/Stokkseyri comparison for the\nwhole original data set, without careful checking of the data\nquality, show tendencies similar to the ones for the selected\nevents, however, with more significant spread in the data.\n3 Results of the comparison\nIn Fig. 4 we compare the l-o-s Stokkseyri velocities with\nDMSP ion drifts for the 29 joint events. A strict require-\nment that the azimuth of the DMSP cross-track velocity and\nthe azimuth of the Stokkseyri beam differ by not more than\n5\u25e6 was selected. The vertical bar for the HF data corresponds\nto the error in the FITACF velocity determination (for the FI-\nTACF procedure, see Villain et al., 1987). The horizontal\nbar for the DMSP drift is simply the standard deviation. The\ndashed line is the line of perfect agreement between the data.\nFor positive DMSP drifts (eastward ion motion), one can\nsee that all points but one are located below the line of perfect\nagreement, and the departure increases for stronger ion drifts.\nFor negative DMSP drifts (westward ion motion), there are\ntwo sorts of points. A small minority of points (circled in\nFig. 4) is located not far from the line of perfect agreement.\nFor the majority of the points though, the Stokkseyri ve-\nlocity magnitude is well below the DMSP drift magnitude,\nsimilar to the result for the positive DMSP drifts. The\nvelocity inconsistency increases as the ion drift magnitude\nincreases. For example, for DMSP drifts of \u223c\u2212400 m\/s, the\nvelocity ratio R=VHF \/VDMSP is \u223c0.25 while for drifts of\nA. V. Koustov et al.: The velocity of E-region HF echoes and E\u00d7B plasma drift 375\n\u223c\u22121300 m\/s it is \u223c0.1. The overall mean ratio R is around\n0.32. If one were to describe the Stokkseyri-DMSP velocity\nrelationship by a linear line, the slope of the line would be\n0.24 and the offset is \u22126.57 m\/s. We should stress that for\nall DMSP values, there was only one point for which the ion\ndrift was smaller than the Stokkseyri velocity.\nAs mentioned, the data presented in Fig. 4 satisfy quite a\nstringent requirement on the alignment between the satellite\nand radar directions of measurements. Analysis of the avail-\nable data showed that with an increase in azimuth difference,\nmore points appear with either reasonable agreement or low\nradar velocities. Also, there are some points for which the\nradar velocity is somewhat larger that the DMSP velocity,\nbut the number of these points is insignificant. For example,\nfor 15\u25e6 of misalignment, 2% of the points had stronger radar\nvelocities.\n4 Discussion\nThe results indicate that the relationship between the HF\nvelocity and E\u00d7B plasma drift is rather complicated. We\nwould like to start the discussion from a cluster of points at\nVDMSP from \u2212700 to \u2212900 m\/s for which there was a rea-\nsonable agreement between the Stokkseyri and DMSP ve-\nlocities (the circled points in Fig. 4). These occurred infre-\nquently, but were present in the data set. We believe that\nthese points correspond to the case of radar echo detection\nfrom the upper E- or bottom F-regions (for shortness, we will\ncall such points \u201cF-region scatter\u201d). In this case, the veloci-\nties indeed should be comparable and this would be consis-\ntent with previous DMSP\/HF velocity comparisons by Baker\net al. (1990) and Xu (2003). One may wonder why the F-\nscatter points appeared in the data statistics despite all possi-\nble efforts have been done to only select E-region echoes. In\nour opinion, the selection process cannot be totally correct,\nespecially if there are patches of enhanced electron density\nin the ionosphere. We showed that the aspect angle condi-\ntions are very sensitive to the electron density in the E-region,\nFig. 1. The same is also true for the F-region observations. If\nthe ionosphere is patchy, one may obtain the F-region scatter\nin some radar cell and the E-region scatter in a radar cell not\nfar away. This can be especially true if the considered radar\ndata are collected at relatively far ranges of more than 500\u2013\n600 km. Also, for some ranges there might be co-existence\nof F - and E-region backscatter in one radar cell (Milan and\nLester, 1998). One might think that the issue can be resolved\nwith the angle-of-arrival information, however, these mea-\nsurements at Stokkseyri were not always available, and in\nthe cases when they were available, it was difficult to make\na judgment. By considering the spectral power distribution\nfor the echoes of reasonable agreement with the Burg spec-\ntral method (Danskin et al., 2004), we found that some of\nthe circled echoes in Fig. 4 had single-peaked, well-defined\nspectra, typical of F-region scatter.\nIf one does not consider these F-region scatter points, the\nmajor conclusion from Fig. 4 is that the HF velocity is less\nthan the E\u00d7B component (convection component) for all\nmagnitudes of the flow. This is not a surprising result for\ndrifts faster than \u223c500 m\/s because it might well be that in\nthese cases, the radar observations were performed within the\nFB instability cone such that the irregularity phase velocity\nwas \u201csaturated\u201d at the ion acoustic speed Cs . The only dif-\nficulty with this explanation would be that the observed HF\nvelocities were 100\u2013300 m\/s, which is below the typical ion-\nacoustic speed of 400 m\/s. One of the ways to understand this\nresult is to accept that the phase velocity of decameter irreg-\nularities is modified by the sharp gradients of the background\nplasma, as suggested by St-Maurice et al. (1994). This may\nbe the case but we think that other explanations are also pos-\nsible.\nDanskin et al. (2004) discovered that E-region HF echoes\nwere often double\/multiple-peaked and the FITACF velocity\n(that was used in producing of Fig. 4 and that was obtained\naccording to the procedure outlined by Villain et al., 1987)\ncorresponded usually to the velocity somewhere in between\nthe shift in the high- and low-velocity components. Accord-\ning to Danskin et al. (2004), the most likely reason for the\nfrequent double-peak E-region echo occurrence at HF is that\ntypical propagation conditions are such that echo detection\nfrom both the top and bottom of the electrojet layer is possi-\nble, as originally pointed out by Uspensky et al. (1994). One\ncan hypothesize that this is the case for the present observa-\ntions. In this situation, one might expect the high-velocity\npeak to be close to the Cs values. To check this scenario, we\nconsidered 22 events (all events for which this type of analy-\nsis was technically possible) and performed the spectral anal-\nysis with the Burg method similar to Danskin et al. (2004).\nResults are shown in Fig. 5.\nIn panel (a) of Fig. 5 we present observations for which\nsingle-peaked spectra were detected. There were 19 points\nspread over 11 events. Clearly, the points are of two kinds.\nSix points lie very close to the line of perfect agreement be-\ntween the radar and satellite data. Out of these, four points\nare at relatively low DMSP drifts so that the radar mea-\nsurements very likely refer to large flow angles for which\nagreement is expected if the echoes originated from the cen-\ntral\/upper part of the electrojet layer. The two points at\nVDMSP\u223c850 m\/s correspond probably to the detection of F-\nregion echoes, as discussed above; also, it is hard to expect\nthe ion-acoustic velocity in access of \u223c650 m\/s. We note\nthat these two points were reported as the points within the\ncircle in Fig. 4. For the other fifteen points in panel (a), the\nradar velocity magnitude is of the order of 100 m\/s and much\nsmaller than the ion drift.\nPanel (b) shows the FITACF velocity versus the DMSP\nion drift for those measurements for which the spectra were\ndouble-peaked according to the Burg analysis. The total\namount of points is 65; they occurred in 22 events. Clearly,\nthere is a number of points for which the radar velocity is\nwell below the DMSP drifts, especially for VDMSP in be-\ntween \u2212750 and \u22121700 m\/s. One would expect that the\nradar observations were performed in directions close to the\nplasma convection (electron flow), within the FB instability\n376 A. V. Koustov et al.: The velocity of E-region HF echoes and E\u00d7B plasma drift\nFig. 5. A comparison of the Stokkseyri l-o-s velocity (FITACF)\nand DMSP cross-track ion drift for 22 events. Panels (a) and (b)\ncorrespond to the cases of single- and double-peaked HF echoes.\nPanel (c) shows velocities of low- (open circles) and high- (filled\ncircles) shifted components of the double-peaked echoes as given\nby the Burg spectrum analysis.\ncone. If one compares the velocity ratios R=VHF \/VDMSP\nfor these data with the velocity ratios at VHF (Nielsen and\nSchlegel, 1985), a conclusion can be made that the velocity\n\u201cdepression\u201d is stronger at HF (for the FITACF case) within\nthe FB instability cone.\nPanel (c) presents the velocity of high-shifted (filled cir-\ncle) and low-shifted (open circle) components for the mea-\nsurements selected in panel (b). One can notice that the\nhigh-shifted velocities are larger than the FITACF veloci-\nties in panel (b) with quite a few at 400\u2013500 m\/s, within\nthe range of expected values of Cs . One can associate these\npoints with the detection of ion-acoustic waves, and the re-\nsult would be consistent with the ones reported by Nielsen\nand Schlegel (1985) at VHF and Foster and Erickson (2000)\nat UHF. The multi-peak nature of many E-region echoes im-\nplies that the identification of Cs saturated waves with the\nSuperDARN FITACF velocity data can often be problematic.\nSome of the high-shifted points in panel (c) are close to\nthe line of perfect agreement between the radar and satellite\ndata, especially for positive DMSP velocities. The points for\nVDMSP=0\u2013400 m\/s, located around the line of perfect agree-\nment, can be interpreted in two ways. One possibility is that\nthese echo components are in fact the top-side E or bottom-\nside F-region scatter; in this case the explanation of high-\nvelocity peaks is the same as the one proposed for the points\ncircled in Fig. 4. Another possibility is that, indeed, the ve-\nlocity of decameter irregularities near or outside the FB in-\nstability cone is roughly the cosine component of the E\u00d7B\nplasma drift as one would expect on the basis of previous\nVHF (e.g. Nielsen et al., 2002) and HF (Villain et al., 1987;\nJayachandran et al., 2000) observations. With the data avail-\nable, we are not able to distinguish from the above two inter-\npretations, hence more comparisons of the E-region HF ve-\nlocity with plasma drift are needed. Clearly, joint work with\nincoherent scatter radar would be of the most help, since for\nsuch observations one can obtain information on the full vec-\ntor of plasma drift, the ion-acoustic speed and the instability\ncone, as well as the electron density profiles needed for eval-\nuation of the propagation conditions.\nThe data presented in Fig. 5c for the low-shifted com-\nponents are consistent with some recent HF observations.\nMakarevitch et al. (2001) reported a cluster of 12-MHz\nechoes whose (FITACF) velocity was low and significantly\nsmaller than the velocity of concurrently observed 50-MHz\nechoes at the Antarctic Syowa station. We recall that the\n50-MHz velocity is believed to be close to the E\u00d7B con-\nvection component (e.g. Ecklund et al., 1977). Koustov et\nal. (2002) reported low Finland HF (FITACF) velocities that\nwere smaller than (or comparable with) the VHF velocities\nthat were estimated to be lower that theE\u00d7B drift due to as-\npect angle attenuation. And finally, Makarevitch et al. (2004)\nanalyzed the azimuthal distribution of the E-region HF (FI-\nTACF) velocities and concluded that they are strongly de-\npressed with respect to the F-region convection estimated\nfrom simultaneously observed F-region echoes at slightly\nlarger ranges.\nWe believe that the low-shifted spectral components in\nFig. 5c correspond to the echo detection from the bottom of\nthe electrojet layer. We are of the same opinion with respect\nto the single-peaked points in Fig. 5a with strongly depressed\nvelocity. The irregularity phase velocity depression at the\nbottom of the electrojet layer can be strong for several rea-\nsons.\nOne of these is the collisional depression, as suggested\nby Koustov et al. (2002). Indeed, the more precise ex-\npression for the phase velocity of the electrojet irregulari-\nties is VE \u00b7 cos \u03b8\/(1+\u03c8), where the factor \u03c8 depends upon\nboth the collision frequencies of electrons and ions with\nneutrals (\u03bden, \u03bdin) and the aspect angle (\u03b1) of observations,\n\u03c8=\u03bden\u03bdin\/ei[1+(2e\/\u03bd2en) sin2 \u03b1], e and i are the\nA. V. Koustov et al.: The velocity of E-region HF echoes and E\u00d7B plasma drift 377\nelectron and ion gyrofrequencies (Fejer and Kelley, 1980).\nIn a case of \u03c8>1\u20132, one can indeed expect strong depres-\nsion of the velocity. This can happen if plasma waves are\nexcited at the bottom of the electrojet layer where, in addi-\ntion, the aspect angles of waves are non zero. With respect to\nthe non-zero aspect angles, we should note that the E-region\nHF echoes are often believed to be received from exactly zero\naspect angles (e.g. Moorcroft, 2002). The present compari-\nson has been performed for the middle part of E-region echo\nbands where the power was generally at maximum so that\nthe best (not necessarily zero) aspect angles were expected.\nHowever, Uspensky et al. (1994) and Uspensky et al. (2003)\nforwarded an idea that an E-region HF echo is a combination\nof a scatter from a range of heights and a range of aspect an-\ngles so that the effective aspect angle is actually always non-\nzero. Whether this hypothesis is generally correct requires\nfurther investigation.\nAnother possible reason for strong velocity depression\nfor the low-shifted components is their excitation through\nneutral wind related plasma instabilities (Kagan and Kel-\nley, 1998; 2000), collisional thermal instabilities (Dimant\nand Sudan, 1995, 1997) or simply due to neutral wind tur-\nbulence (Gurevich et al., 1997). We note that the veloci-\nties of some low-shifted components are very close to zero\nwhich might indicate that in fact these echoes are simply the\nground scatter received through anomalous radio wave prop-\nagation channels. Ground scatter at short ranges of 400\u2013500\nkm can be expected in the presence of strong electron density\npatches.\nFinally, the reported differences between the DMSP ion\ndrift and Stokkseyri l-o-s velocity can result from violation\nof the cosine rule for the velocity variation with the flow\nangle. For observations within the FB instability cone, this\nstatement is simply a re-wording of the fact that the veloc-\nity is saturated at Cs . For observations at large flow angles,\none may expect deviations from the cosine rule because of\nthe ion-drift contribution to the irregularity phase velocity as\nargued by Makarevitch et al. (2002b), who presented data\nfor the E-region HF velocities, indicating the violation of the\ncosine rule. Later, Makarevitch et al. (2004) showed that in-\nclusion of the ion contribution under the assumption of the\nfinite aspect angle (as suggested by Uspensky et al., 2003)\nallows for an explanation for some features in the HF veloc-\nity azimuthal behavior identified by the Finland SuperDARN\nradar. The data of the present study do not allow for investi-\ngation of the validity of the cosine rule, since the full vector\nof the E\u00d7B drift was not available.\n5 Conclusions\nIn this study we compared directly the velocity of E-region\nStokkseyri HF echoes and the E\u00d7B plasma drift component\nalong the radar beam as measured by the DMSP satellites\nand showed that:\n1. The FITACF velocity is typically smaller than the\nE\u00d7B component in a broad range of DMSP drifts\nbetween 0 and 1700 m\/s. The overall average ratio\nR=VHF \/VDMSP is 0.35. This ratio is \u223c0.41 for low\ndrifts of <400 m\/s and can be as low as 0.1 for large\ndrifts of >1000 m\/s.\n2. The observed spectra of short-range Stokkseyri echoes\nare often double-peaked. The spectral analysis of such\nechoes with the Burg method shows that of the two\nspectral components, the high-velocity one is close to\nthe E\u00d7B drift for the slow plasma flows of <400 m\/s.\nThe high-velocity component is in the range of 400\u2013\n700 m\/s (possible Csvalues) for fast plasma flows of\n>700 m\/s. For all strengths of the plasma flow, the low-\nshifted Stokkseyri velocity magnitudes are in between 0\nand 200 m\/s. The low velocities were also observed for\nsome of the single-peaked HF echoes.\n3. One of the reasons for the HF FITACF velocity being\nsmaller than the E\u00d7B drift component can be the pres-\nence of a low-shifted echo component corresponding\nmost likely to the scatter from the bottom of the elec-\ntrojet layer.\nAcknowledgements.
