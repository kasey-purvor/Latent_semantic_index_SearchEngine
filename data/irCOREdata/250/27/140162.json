Introduction \nNumerous techniques exist for determining the surface profile of an object [1]. The most basic methods \nuse a stylus, placed in contact with the surface and tracked across it, to map out the shape [2]. These are \npoint techniques, in which a single measurement acquires information from a single point on the surface. \nSince the stylus contacts the surface, there is a risk of measurement-induced damage; therefore non-\ncontact, optical methods have been developed. Triangulation, which uses a light beam focused onto the \nsurface, is the optical point-measurement equivalent of the stylus methods [3]. Full-field versions of this \ntechnique also exist, enabling two-dimensional data to be acquired from a single measurement. However, \nsteep changes in surface gradient result in \u2018shadowing\u2019, because some areas of the surface are inaccessible \nto measurement. This also prevents triangulation systems from being able to look through holes to \ninternal surfaces of the test piece. \nNon-interferometric full-field methods include Moir\u00e9 [4,5], Fourier transform [6,7] and fringe projection \nprofilometry [8,9]. The resolution of Fourier transform methods is limited to around 1 mm. Moir\u00e9 and \nfringe projection techniques, and the interferometric methods [10,11], are capable of higher resolution, \nbut the diameter of the area under investigation is then often limited to a few centimetres. Discontinuities, \nor surface slope variations of more than an order of magnitude across the image region, compromise the \nperformance of fringe methods, due to an inability to determine the fringe order at all positions [12]. \n                                                 \n3 Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. \nLow-coherence optical fibre speckle interferometry \n 2\nInterferometric techniques have the potential to provide absolute measurement of surface profile with \nmicron scale resolution and centimetres of range. Both point and full-field implementations are possible. \nHowever, any techniques requiring an off-axis configuration, for which the illumination and observation \naxes do not coincide, suffer from shadowing problems. \nSpeckle interferometry is a generic term for a range of non-contact optical configurations that measure \nfeatures of an object surface using the speckle effect, seen when an optically rough surface is illuminated \nby light coherent on the scale of the path differences corresponding to the surface roughness [13]. \nAlthough low-coherence interferometry has been in use for many years, its application in speckle \ninterferometry techniques is much more recent [14,15]. The sources used can be relatively inexpensive, \nand good results can be obtained over a surface even if the slope varies widely in different regions of the \nimage. Discontinuities in object height do not cause a problem. The use of optical fibres to replace bulk \ncomponents in such systems typically increases portability and flexibility of deployment, and enables \npath-length matching to be achieved in compact arrangements, even for larger objects. Applications \nforeseen include quality control, solid modelling (the transfer of contour information to computer \nnumerical control (CNC) machines) and measurement of surface wear due, for example, to erosion or \ncorrosion.  \nIn low-coherence speckle interferometry, light scattered from the object surface is mixed with a reference \nbeam and imaged onto a CCD camera. If the optical paths for the object and reference beams match \nwithin the coherence length of the source, then interferometric speckles will be observed, the intensity of \nwhich are seen to modulate sinusoidally with changes in the reference path length [16]. The coherence \nlength of an optical source correlates inversely with the spectral bandwidth [17]. A multimode diode laser \nwith a bandwidth of a few nanometres has a coherence length of the order of 100 microns, while a true \n\u2018white light\u2019 source, such as a tungsten halogen bulb, has a coherence length of just a few microns. As the \nreference beam path is varied, interferometric speckles are seen along contour lines corresponding to the \ndepth of the surface in the direction parallel to the optical axis [14]. The coherence length of the source \ndetermines the depth resolution, which is related to the width of the interferometric speckle contour lines. \nFull-field low-coherence speckle interferometry has been demonstrated using a system called \u2018light-in-\nflight\u2019, which uses a pulsed source and time-gating [18]. Implementation was made difficult in this bulk-\noptic system because the long path lengths required to profile large objects necessitated construction of a \nvery large instrument, not easily transported outside the laboratory environment. In this paper, we \ndescribe the development of optical fibre-based implementations of the low-coherence speckle technique, \nenabling compact, flexible systems to be constructed. A proposed configuration using a single axis for \nillumination and detection is discussed. This eliminates the shadowing problems encountered with \ntechniques such as triangulation, and, provided that the axis of the hole is near-parallel with the optical \naxis, allows the system to see through a hole in the test surface. \n \n2. Theory \nThe speckle effect is the granular appearance observed when a coherent source illuminates a surface \nrough on the scale of the illumination wavelength [19]. The speckle is caused by interference of light \nscattered from the object surface. The roughness results in path differences of the order of the wavelength. \nOver a localized region of space where the summed wave vectors remain approximately constant, the \nresultant intensity appears as a bright, a dark or a mid-tone speckle with a particular phase value. \nThe average dimension of a speckle is generally defined as the width of the autocorrelation function of \nthe intensity distribution [20]. When a speckle image of the object is obtained using a lens, the resulting \nspeckle pattern is termed \u2018subjective speckle\u2019 and the average speckle diameter S is given by \n \nFMS \u03bb)1(22.1 +=                                                               (1)  \nwhere M is the magnification of the imaging system, \u03bb the source wavelength and F the f-number of the \nlens. This clearly gives the user some control over the speckle size by adjusting the size of the lens \naperture; necessary to maximize the spatial resolution of measurements obtained from speckle images. \nLow-coherence optical fibre speckle interferometry \n 3\nThe usual criterion for optimum resolution is to image one speckle onto one pixel of the CCD camera \nused for image capture [21]. \n \nInformation about a surface is obtained by correlating fringes, usually obtained by subtracting one or \nmore reference images from each of a set of phase-stepped interferometric speckle images and rectifying \nthe resulting values before display [19]. This removes the random speckle phase information while \nretaining information about interferometer phase across the image. Correlation fringes can also be \nobtained by addition of the reference image to the phase-stepped images, but the correlation fringes are \nthen superimposed on a dc term, which must be removed by filtering. The subtraction method is therefore \nconsidered preferable.  \nParameters including shape [22], deformation [23], strain [24] or vibration [25,26,27] can be determined \nfrom the correlation fringe images. We consider first the situation of illumination by a high-coherence \nlaser source. To extract the required information, two or more correlation fringe images obtained under \ndifferent conditions must be combined, to yield information relating to the relative phases of \ncorresponding speckles in each of the images. In profilometry, it is the shape of the object that is of \ninterest. The usual technique is to acquire between three and five correlation images, for which the \nreference beam path length is altered by a known fraction of a wavelength between frames to introduce a \nknown phase difference in the interferometer. This is known as \u2018phase stepping\u2019. Simple algorithms exist \n[14,28,29], each suited to the number of phase steps employed, which enable the information from all \nacquired frames to be combined to extract either the amplitude or the phase of the correlation fringes. \nUsually, it is the phase that needs to be measured. \nGiven precise input data, those phase-stepping techniques that involve more steps lead to a more accurate \nphase measurement, since the sampling of the fringe pattern is better. Processing time increases with the \nnumber of steps, so a 3-step algorithm might be preferred where high speed processing is important. \nHowever, 4- and 5-step algorithms minimize sensitivity to any systematic error in the phase step. \nFollowing processing, a display of the image frame containing the calculated phase will show the phase \nmodulo \u03c0, so a \u2018phase unwrapping\u2019 procedure is necessary to calculate the actual relative phase across the \nsurface [30]. This often requires a degree of a priori knowledge about the form of the surface i.e. \npresence of discontinuities and sense of surface gradient. \n \nThe system described in this paper incorporates a broadband, low-coherence source rather than a single \nmode laser. This has implications for the appearance of the speckle patterns and the processing methods \nemployed [14]. \nIf we consider the basic speckle image acquired from a single frame of the camera, interferometric \nspeckles occur only where the object and reference path lengths match to within the coherence length of \nthe source. Thus, the correlation images appear dark except in these regions of interferometric speckle. \nHere, the speckles will modulate with varying amplitude as the reference path length is scanned, the \nvisibility reaching a maximum for zero path-length imbalance. Thus if the bandwidth of the source is \nchosen to ensure a very small coherence length, for example a few tens of microns, the depth co-ordinate \nof any point on the measured surface is determined, with high resolution, from the position of maximum \nfringe amplitude. In low-coherence speckle interferometry (LCSI), the amplitude, rather than the phase, is \ntherefore the parameter of interest. For this reason, LCSI is an absolute measurement method, since \namplitude, unlike phase, is determined uniquely and absolutely from the phase-stepping algorithm. The \ndepth resolution obtained from the system depends on the source coherence length and the ability of the \ndetection system to identify correctly the central fringe within the coherence envelope as the reference \npath is scanned. \n \n \n \n \nLow-coherence optical fibre speckle interferometry \n 4\n3. System components \n \n3.1. Source considerations  \nSince the depth resolution of a LCSI system is dependent primarily upon source spectral profile, the \nchoice of broadband source is of critical importance in obtaining the best performance from the \ninstrument. Sources that have been employed for low-coherence interferometry include thermal types, e.g. \ntungsten halogen lamp [31], discharge lamps such as mercury or xenon lamps [32], light-emitting and \nsuperluminescent diodes (LEDs and SLDs) [33] and multimode laser diodes (MMLDs) [34]. The first two \nof these are true \u2018white light\u2019 sources with bandwidths in excess of 1000 nm, from the ultra-violet through \nto the infra-red (IR). The others have bandwidths typically of several tens of nanometres and operate in \nthe visible and IR. LEDs generate photons through spontaneous emission and typically have a low power \noutput. SLDs are similar but use a higher current density so that the power available is much higher. \nMMLDs generate stimulated emission and have cleaved facets to the chip, which form an optical \nresonator cavity. This feature also accounts for the typical structure of the MMLD spectrum, which \ncomprises a series of narrow peaks within an envelope profile. Recently, super-continuum sources have \nbeen developed, based on photonic crystal fibres, with bandwidths of over 100 nm. These have been \ndemonstrated in optical coherence tomography [35]. However, they are generally expensive and rather \nbulky, as they require a pump laser. \nOf the source types described here, all could potentially be employed in a LCSI system, although the low \npower output of LEDs is likely to limit their usefulness. Additional criteria apply, however, in a fibre-\nbased system. True white light sources seem initially very attractive as they have a coherence length of no \nmore than a few microns, but the coupling efficiency from this type of source into single-mode optical \nfibre is extremely low, rendering them unsuitable for consideration. \nThe experimental work for this project was carried out shortly before high-power, broadband \nsuperluminescent sources became widely available. Although coupling efficiency into fibre is much \nhigher for LEDs and SLDs due to the spatial coherence of the beam, the limited power obtained until \nrecently from devices of this type meant that they could be used in fibre-based systems only for \nexamination of very small objects. The maximum power available from an SLD was then about 1 mW, \nwhereas it has recently become possible to obtain SLDs with powers in excess of 30 mW and bandwidths \nof about 50 nm, making them more attractive for use in low-coherence systems. \nIn this work, the use of Sony 201V-3 (40 mW) and 202V-3 (20 mW) MMLDs was investigated, with \nwavelengths close to 800 nm. The coherence length was measured as the FWHM of the interferogram \nobtained by inserting the source into a scanned Michelson interferometer with one reflector mounted on a \nmoving translation stage, and was found to be 40\u03bcm for the 201V-3 source run below threshold, and \n150\u03bcm above threshold. Although the spectral widths of multimode laser diodes are thus less appropriate \nfor high-resolution LCSI than those of SLDs, MMLDs were selected for the systems detailed in this paper \nbecause they offered the best combination of relatively high power, up to hundreds of milliwatts for the \nmost powerful devices, and spectral bandwidth. Additionally, the coupling efficiency into singlemode \noptical fibre is good. Measures were introduced in this project to reduce the undesirably high degree of \ncoherence and to exploit the comb-like spectral structure to improve resolution. These are discussed \nbelow in more detail. \n \n3.1 Source selection for fibre-based low-coherence speckle systems \nThe combination of two monochromatic sources of different wavelengths 1\u03bb and 2\u03bb results in a beat \nwavelength [36] \n21\n21\n\u03bb\u03bb\n\u03bb\u03bb\u03bb \u2212=synth                                                                     (2) \nknown as the \u2018synthetic wavelength\u2019. For broadband MMLD sources, the spectral distribution of the \nsynthetic wavelength is also broadened, leading to a decrease in the coherence length, but the mean value \nLow-coherence optical fibre speckle interferometry \n 5\ncan be obtained as before by substituting the mean values for the individual sources into the above \nequation. \nMaximising the intensity difference between the central fringe and the two adjacent fringes eases correct \nidentification of the central fringe in an interferogram formed from combined sources. This requires the \ncentral fringe packet in the envelope of the synthetic distribution to be very narrow. Ideally, only 3-5 \nfringes should fall within the central packet. Calculation of the synthetic distribution satisfying this \nrequirement leads to an optimum separation between the mean wavelengths for the two sources, which \nare assumed to be of equal, known coherence length [37]. For the optimum wavelength combination, the \nintensity of the central fringe must also be equal in each of the two combining spectral distributions to \nobtain the best possible signal-to-noise ratio. \nCombined MMLDs were investigated experimentally, and proved very effective in bulk-optic LCSI, in \nimproving the depth resolution of the system. However, in the subsequent fibre-optic based systems it \nwas found that no wavelength beating occurred between the two sources and, instead of the expected \nperiodic beat pattern, a single pair of broad, bright fringes was seen in the images. This can be explained \nas a consequence of the material dispersion of the glass fibres, in which the refractive index, and therefore \nthe optical path difference, is dependent upon the transmitted wavelength. It can be inferred that spatial \nresolution problems will also be experienced with very broadband single sources. Although the reduction \nin coherence length with increasing source bandwidth reduces the SNR required to identify the central \nfringe, the correlation fringes will appear broadened in the images because of the dispersion, reducing \nspatial resolution in the plane perpendicular to the optical axis. \nThe dispersion could, in principle, be compensated, at the expense of increased complexity of the system, \nbut it was considered preferable in this project to employ a single MMLD source for fibre-optic systems. \n \nThe possibility of using pulsed MMLDs was also investigated. Pulsing broadens the spectrum while \nretaining a high optical power output. This has previously been used in absolute distance measurement \napplications [38]. The pulse broadening occurs because of refractive index changes in the laser cavity, \ndue to a combination of carrier density fluctuations and thermal effects. For small signal modulation \nfrequencies the thermal effect is dominant, whereas at frequencies in the GHz range the carrier density is \nmore important. Pulsing was achieved using a function generator to modulate the diode. A sinusoidal \npulsing signal of amplitude 50mA was imposed in addition to a DC bias current of 100mA. The diode \nspectrum was observed by coupling the beam into an optical spectrum analyser via a length of single \nmode fibre. \nPulsing was investigated using a 20 mW Sony SLD202V-3 multimode laser diode at 812 nm. Laser \nspectra are shown in figure 1(a) and (b) for both cw operation and for pulsing at 100 Hz. The ratio of \npower obtained under pulsed operation to that measured under cw operation is 0.32, and the FWHM \nspectral width, derived from a Gaussian fit to the spectrum, increases from 3.2 \u00b1 0.5 nm to 4.0 \u00b1 0.5 nm. \nThe lasing mode width also increases considerably due to the pulsing, smoothing the overall spectrum. \nThe calculated coherence length for the laser in pulsed mode is reduced by a factor of 1.2 compared with \nthe cw coherence length, from 206\u03bcm to 165\u03bcm. Figure 1(c) and (d) show the effect of pulsing on the \nvisibility of correlation fringes generated from a tilted circular plate. The multiple bright lines represent \npeaks in the correlation envelope. The intensity of the central fringe packet relative to its immediate \nneighbours is enhanced by pulsing, and the intensity of the peripheral fringes drops off more rapidly, \nreducing the total number of visible fringes across the image. Note that the fringe packet spacing is \nunchanged, in accordance with theory. \nA form of source noise, known as \u201claser partition noise\u201d, results from variations in the relative intensity \nof modes of the lasing spectrum with time [39]. It was found to be beneficial to average the interferogram \nover a number of images. The effect is to cancel any noise caused by random variations in spectral shape \nfrom pulse to pulse. The optical power output from a pulsed MMLD is of the same order of magnitude as \nthat from the laser run under cw operation. Thus the pulsed MMLD provided the best overall performance \nas a source for fibre-based LCSI, and was the source used in all subsequent experimental designs. \nLow-coherence optical fibre speckle interferometry \n 6\n \n \n \n \n \n3.2 Detector \nThe detector for the results displayed in this paper was an 8-bit analogue CCD camera. A 12-bit digital \ncamera was investigated for comparison to assess the significance of pixel noise and digitization noise on \nthe overall measurement precision. However, no discernible improvement in performance was obtained \nby using the higher specification camera, implying that, for these measurements, thermally-induced \nchanges in speckle intensity between frames are more significant in the overall measurement uncertainty \nthan any noise introduced by the detector. The digital camera did offer the advantage of longer image \nintegration times, improving signal intensity towards the edges of the images. \n \n \n  \n(a) (b) \n(c) (d) \nFigure 1.

A low-coherence fibre speckle interferometer (LCFSI) for 3D shape measurement \n \n \n \n \nDuring the development of a LCFSI for 3D shape measurement, several experimental configurations were \ninvestigated. The basic design is shown in figure 2. Light from a MMLD was coupled into a fibre \ndirectional coupler (DC) with an 80\/20 split ratio. One output of the coupler was used to illuminate the \ntest object. About 3-5 mW of optical power illuminated the object surface. The output from the other arm \nof the coupler was collimated and retro-reflected by a plane mirror mounted on a computer-driven \ntranslation stage. The hysteresis of the translation stage was assessed by repeating a profile measurement \ntwice while scanning the translation stage in opposite directions for the two scans. No detectable \nhysteresis was discovered. \nThe reflected light was re-coupled into the system and transmitted through to the fourth port of the \ncoupler, where a beam splitter was used to direct the ouput beam into the CCD camera. This constituted \nthe reference beam. The reference and signal beams combined in the camera plane to create the \ninterferogram, which was acquired and displayed by the PC. However, induced birefringence arising from \nfibre deployment leads to differing states of polarization in the signal and reference arms of the system. A \ncoiled-fibre polarization state controller, positioned in the illumination fibre, was therefore used to adjust \nthe state of polarization and prevent signal fading. Depolarisation of light can occur on scattering from an \noptically-rough test object, but this is not generally a major problem for singly scattering surfaces, such as \nthe lightly abraded metal surfaces investigated here, at near-normal incident angles [40]. Employing fibre \nincreases the flexibility of the system as a whole since it is no longer necessary to ensure precise matching \nof \u201cair paths\u201d in the interferometer. Approximate matching of the lengths of optical fibre is more \nstraightforward, and the final correction required can be achieved using a short, adjustable air path. \nInitially, the collimating lenses were omitted from both illumination outputs of the coupler. Given \nsufficient source power, it is possible to investigate large objects using this system, because the beams \nfrom the fibres are divergent. However, the spatially-dependent path length differences between the signal \nand reference beams produce concentric circular fringes for a flat plate object at typical working \ndistances. This does not prevent use of the system, but interpretation of the correlation fringes requires \nadditional computation, and requires accurate measurement of several parameters related to the \nFigure 2. Design for optical fibre-based LCFSI system, using collimated illumination and reference beams.  MMLD: \nmultimode laser diode,  MO1,2: microscope objectives to couple light from the source into fibre, MO3,4: \nmicroscope objectives for beam collimation, DC: directional coupler, BS: beam splitter, PZT: piezoelectric mirror \nmount. \nLow-coherence optical fibre speckle interferometry \n 8\nexperimental geometry. The original design was therefore modified to include the additional lenses, as \nshown in figure 2. Both object and reference beams were now collimated as they left the delivery fibres. \nAlthough illumination of large object areas using this modified system requires similarly large, and \ncostly, collimation optics, there is an advantage in the removal of spurious circular fringes from the \ninterferogram. It should be noted that the illumination for these systems is slightly off-axis, which must \nbe accounted for in calculating the surface profile. \n \nAn on-axis implementation of the system could be realized, by using a polarizing beamsplitter (PBS), and \narranging for signal and reference beams with a common polarisation to enter opposing faces of the PBS. \nThe counter-propagating signal and reference beams are both reflected, and therefore separated by the \nPBS, with an appropriately oriented quarter wave plate positioned in the path of the signal beam to rotate \nthe polarization state through 90o following a double pass through the component. The returning signal \nbeam is now transmitted by the PBS, and a polariser is positioned in front of the detector at 45o to both \nbeams to enable interferometric mixing on beam recombination at this position. The on-axis version of \nthe system would avoid any shadowing problems that could be encountered with sharp changes of \ngradient of the object surface, and would allow the system to look through holes in a test piece to internal \nsurfaces below.  \n \nEqualization of the optical path lengths in the interferometer arms was realized by inserting a single-mode \nlaser diode as the source. Modulating the optical frequency of the laser diode produces a phase change in \nthe interferometer when a path length imbalance exists. This method has been used to measure path-\nlength imbalance in fibre ESPI systems [41]. The interferometer can be balanced to within a centimetre or \nso by minimising the phase change, and final searching for the coherent interferogram can be performed \nby translating the stage-mounted mirror under computer control. \n \n4.1 Image processing \nMany computational techniques exist for extraction of the fringe amplitude from speckle interferograms. \nHowever, the Hariharan [42] or five-step technique has the advantage that errors due to miscalibration of \nthe selected phase step can be minimized, if a step value of \u03c0\/2 is chosen. The expression for the fringe \namplitude then becomes \n2\n351\n2\n24 )2()(44\n1),( IIIIIyxA \u2212++\u2212=                                   (3) \nA PC running LabViewTM was used to control acquisition, since the program enabled synchronization of \nthe translation stage, camera and PZT to allow automated data processing. Five images were acquired and \nsmoothed using a median filter. For each pixel, the amplitude A(x,y) was determined. Acquisition and \nsmoothing was repeated 10 times and the results averaged, to remove the effects of random fluctuations in \nthe pulsed laser spectrum. After averaging, the contour depth was calculated. Consecutive frames \ncontaining values of the averaged fringe amplitude were compared to find the maximum within the mirror \nscan range for each pixel. A depth value was then assigned to the pixel from the mirror position \nassociated with this frame. \n \n4.2 Temperature sensitivity \nThe thermal expansion of silica and its refractive index sensitivity can lead to phase variations of the \nguided beam with temperature. At a wavelength of 800 nm, the thermal phase change for this type of fibre \nis about 190 rad oC-1m-1, with the major effect being refractive index variation rather than thermal \nexpansion. Although the phase is not measured using LCFSI, any phase variations can affect accuracy \nsince the fringe amplitude measurement relies on a phase-shifting method. Both fibre arms of the \ninterferometer are constructed of the same type of fibre. Therefore, if the same temperature change affects \nboth arms, the important parameter is the difference in length between the two fibres, which for our \nsystem was 0.28 m. Thus the phase variation due to temperature can be calculated as 53 rad oC-1. This \nLow-coherence optical fibre speckle interferometry \n 9\nrepresents a movement of about 9 fringes for a 1oC rise in temperature, and implies that the system should \nbe packaged in an insulating enclosure to avoid problems of fringe drift. \n \n4.3 Depth of field \nSince three-dimensional objects are imaged using the LCFSI technique, the depth of field of the imaging \nsystem is an important consideration. Poor depth of field can lead to reduction in fringe visibility and \nhence to a reduced SNR. Depth of field is inversely related to the light-gathering power or F-number of \nthe lens, and a compromise will generally be necessary between the two. In our system, a zoom lens with \nthe focal length f variable between 28 and 70mm was used as the imaging optic. The depth of field was \ncalculated from the lens parameters, using an assumed object distance of 400mm, to be 44mm for \nf=28mm, and 8mm for f=70mm. \nAssuming the worst-case depth of field for the system, defocus will occur for an object where the \nvariation in surface contour is more than 8mm. This was not a problem for the objects examined in the \npresent study. However, for large object tilts or surface curvature, defocus could become important. There \nare two ways of overcoming the problem; one is to divide the surface into smaller regions, each of which \ncan be imaged without excessive defocus by adjusting the focusing condition of the lens. The other \nsolution is to employ telecentric lenses, which provide a constant magnification over the entire field of \nview, and have a typical depth of field up to about 50mm. The disadvantage of telecentric systems is that \nthe maximum object size is fixed and is typically rather small at less than about 100mm [43]. \n \n4.4 Measurements on a circular plate made using the LCFSI \nThe test object used was a circular plate, 20 mm in diameter, made from stainless steel polished to a \nsurface roughness of about 2\u03bcm. No additional surface finish was applied during measurements on this \nobject. Figure 3 shows a typical set of correlation fringes obtained for a tilt applied in the horizontal \ndirection, and figures 4(a) and (b) depict 3D mesh graphs before and after application of a filter to remove \nspurious peaks caused by incorrect identification of the central fringe. Selection of an appropriate filter \nhere is of great importance, in order to remove spurious peaks without also removing true features of the \nobject. For example, a discontinuous step may exist on the object surface. To distinguish this from a spike \non a single pixel, a neighbour comparison can be applied over a small region of pixels. A pixel within the \nregion, which differs in depth from a certain number of its neighbours by more than a pre-selected value, \nis discarded. If the threshold number of required neighbours is taken to be at least half of those in the \nregion, erosion of the image edges will be avoided. The maximum desirable gradient of the measured \nsurface (disregarding step changes) is one mirror step per pixel. Therefore, if a neighbourhood comprises \na region of 5x5 pixels, a maximum allowed pixel-to-pixel depth variation can be defined at slightly more \nthan four times the mirror step. This is the process that has been applied to figure 4(a), resulting in 4(b). \nThe removal of the peaks produces \u201cgaps\u201d in the data corresponding to the unusable pixels. These can be \nfilled by interpolation to improve the appearance of the final profile image. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) (b) (c) \nFigure 3. Correlation fringes obtained from a stainless steel plate, tilted slightly in the horizontal direction, under \npulsed illumination from a MMLD. The images illustrate the movement of the brightest fringe from (a) left to (b) \ncentre and finally (c) right of the image as the reference mirror is scanned. \nLow-coherence optical fibre speckle interferometry \n 10\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProfiles, shown in figure 5, were acquired for tilt angles of 10o \u00b1 0.5o, 20o \u00b1 0.5o and 30o \u00b1 0.5o relative to \nthe camera plane, determined by applying trigonometry to distances measured on the optical table. \nThe interferometrically measured tilt was obtained in each case by fitting a plane to the acquired profile, \nusing a least-squares method, and the resulting values were 5.62o \u00b1 0.04o, 16.19o \u00b1 0.04o and 26.46o \u00b1 \n0.04o. There is an average systematic error angle of 4.0o, which corresponds to half the illumination offset \nangle of 8o. When a correction is applied for this, interferometrically measured tilt values are in good \nagreement with the independent measurements. \nFrom figure 5, it can be seen that the number of unusable data points increases with tilt angle, because the \nscattered optical power collected by the camera is reduced. However, the data acquired are sufficient to \ndefine the surface even at the highest tilt angle of 30o. A second set of measurements was made for an \nillumination angle of 11o, and the systematic error angle was now found to be 5.5o, confirming the \ngeometrical interpretation of this offset. \nThe uncertainty in the measurement of surface depth, calculated as the standard deviation of the sample \ndata from the fitted plane, is about \u00b120\u03bcm. \n \n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.

Polarization-maintaining low-coherence fibre speckle interferometry (PM-LCFSI) \nThe fibre systems described above are constructed from standard single-mode optical fibre. A common \nproblem encountered with optical-fibre interferometric systems is drifting of the polarization state, \nresulting from birefringence induced in the fibres by bending or pressure stresses due to the deployment \nof the fibre. The induced birefringence causes a random variation of the preferred polarization axes \nwhich, when the reference and signal beams propagate in different fibres, can result in the polarization \nstates of the two interfering beams becoming mismatched or even orthogonal, with a consequent \nreduction or loss of the interference signal. The signal intensity is also time-varying because of changes in \nfibre deployment conditions and ambient temperature. \nMounting sections of the fibre interferometer arms on polarization state controllers and adjusting these to \ncorrect for changes in polarization can reduce signal fading. This solution, however, requires a monitoring \nand feedback control circuit for correction of the polarization state, which considerably increases the \ncomplexity of the optical system. \nAn alternative solution is to construct the optical system using polarization-maintaining fibre. The \npolarization state of light propagating in a linear polarization mode of the fibre will then be unaffected by \nenvironmentally-induced changes. All fibre components, such as couplers, must also be polarization \nmaintaining, which increases the cost of the system. However, such components are not unduly \nexpensive. \nA modified version of our LCFSI system was constructed using Fujikura PANDA-type polarization-\nmaintaining fibre with a beat length of 3 mm. It was also considered that mounting a reference mirror on \nthe object would offer advantages. It eases the setting up process required to ensure path-length matching \nin the interferometer, and relaxes the stability requirements between the interferometer and the test object, \ndue to the high degree of common-mode rejection obtained using this configuration. It also reduces \nconsiderably the lengths of fibre required in the reference arm to match the object arm path length. As the \nobject-to-instrument distance is changed, the local reference beam compensates for this and no additional \nfibre is required in the reference path to reach approximate path length balance. Figure 6 shows the \nexperimental arrangement of the system, with a small reference mirror mounted on the test object. Ideally, \nthe reference beam would be generated from scattered light gathered directly from a point on the object \nsurface in a similar way to that used in a fibre optic ESPI vibration sensor [44]. For some surface finishes \nthis might be possible, but in our case it was found to produce insufficient power in the reference beam. \n(c) \nFigure 5.

Reference and signal light then recombine at the \nbeamsplitter, forming an image on the CCD camera. \nThe fibre arms of the polarization-maintaining couplers, which were fabricated in our laboratories using \nthe polished half-block technique [45], were fusion-spliced to construct this system, using an arrangement \nincorporating a rotating chuck to match the polarization axes of the spliced fibres. \n \n \n \n \n5.1 Measurements on test objects using the PM-LCFSI \nTest objects were investigated with the polarization-maintaining system, including a tilted metal plate as \nbefore, a coin and a stepped test piece. The aim of these measurements was to compare the resolution of \nthe polarization-maintaining system with that of the system constructed from standard fibre. All \nprocedures used to compare experimental and theoretical data were as for the previous measurements in \nsection 4 above. \n \n5.1.1. Tilted plate. Measurements on the tilted plate were repeated at mirror-step intervals of 10, 5 and \n2\u03bcm, to investigate the effect of the different sampling intervals on the results obtained. The object-\nmounted mirror places an additional constraint on the measurements, since a sufficient fraction of the \noptical power reflected by the reference mirror must be collected to constitute a useful reference beam. \nThis limits the angle of tilt that can be tolerated in the region where the reference mirror is mounted. A \nminiature corner cube could be used instead of the mirror to remove this limitation. The object tilt as \nmeasured from the system geometry was \u20131o \u00b1 0.5o. \nThe test object was tilted slightly during measurement to avoid specular reflections into the camera. \nProfiles were acquired for the three different step intervals, and the corresponding values for the \ninterferometrically measured tilt and the uncertainty in depth measurement are given in table 1. \nFigure 6. Configuration for optical fibre-based PM-LCFSI system, with object-mounted reference mirror.  MMLD: \nmultimode laser diode,  MO1,2: microscope objectives to couple light from the source into fibre, MO3: objective for \nfocusing reference beam onto object, MO4,5,6: objectives for beam collimation, DC1,2,3: polarization-maintaining \ndirectional couplers, PZT: piezoelectric mirror mount. \nLow-coherence optical fibre speckle interferometry \n 13\nAgreement with the independent measurement of angle is good in all cases, but the measurement \naccuracy appears to be independent of the step interval chosen. This implies that other sources of error, \nsuch as speckle noise and laser noise, cause uncertainties in measured depth that are greater than the \nlargest step interval investigated. The uncertainty in the depth measurement for the PM-LCFSI system is \nabout 14\u03bcm, compared with the best value measured for the standard fibre system of about 20\u03bcm. This \nimprovement is commensurate with a reduction in intensity variations resulting from the elimination of \npolarization-based signal fading. \n \n \n \nMirror step Total tilt (degrees) Depth error (\u03bcm) \n10 -0.68 \u00b10.50 13.4 \n5 -0.69 \u00b10.50 13.6 \n2 -0.71 \u00b10.50 13.9 \n \n \nThere is a difference in the appearance of profiles obtained using the three different step intervals. More \n\u2018gaps\u2019 in the data are seen when the step size is larger. These represent areas where no valid data was \ncollected. With a smaller step interval, the density of data collected is greater, and therefore the total \nnumber of \u2018valid points\u2019 is higher. This must be borne in mind when profiling objects with a highly \ndetailed surface structure.  \n \nAlignment of this interferometer system was expected to be much easier than for the earlier version. To \ndemonstrate this feature, the distance between the camera and the test object was changed, causing a loss \nof path balance and therefore of interference fringes. Adjustment was then carried out until interference \nfringes could once again be seen in the images. Even following a relatively large movement of the object \n(about 40mm), minimal adjustment was required to retrieve the fringes, consisting primarily of re-\nfocusing the reference beam onto the miniature mirror at its new location. It is advantageous that the \nstage-mounted mirror no longer has to be translated many millimetres to a new position, which can \nnecessitate troublesome re-alignment to re-optimize the fibre coupling in this section. It also allows a \nstage with much shorter travel range to be used, encompassing simply the maximum object depth \nexpected. \n \n5.1.2. Five pence coin. A CCD image of a UK five pence coin under white-light illumination is shown in \nfigure 7(a). The diameter of the coin is 18mm. Initially, problems were encountered in obtaining a profile, \ndue to specular reflections from some regions of the coin saturating areas of the camera image. Tilting the \ncoin helped, but did not completely eliminate the specular reflections. Immersing the coin in a weak acid \nsolution for an hour to etch the surface was found to alleviate the problem. Surface characteristics are \nalways a consideration in speckle-based profiling systems, since roughness at or greater than the scale of \nthe illumination wavelength is required for speckle formation. \nA profile was measured with a mirror step of 5\u03bcm. Figure 7(b) shows a three-dimensional mesh plot. The \nblack regions towards the base of the coin, around the neck of the Queen\u2019s head and between the letters \nTable 1. Object tilt and depth error for a tilted plate, measured from profiles acquired using the PM-LCFSI system.\nLow-coherence optical fibre speckle interferometry \n 14\ncorrespond to patches of data that are missing after application of the noise filter algorithm. However, \ndata density was generally good, and a profile was obtained with a precision of about \u00b116\u03bcm. \n \n                       \n \n \n \n5.1.3. Stepped test piece. The test object, shown in figure 8, consisted of a cylindrical aluminium bar, 1 \ncm in diameter, the end of which was machined to produce a series of four concentric circular steps. As \nshown in the figure, the reduction in diameter between levels was 2 mm, and the step positions relative to \nthe top surface were, respectively, \u201340 \u00b1 2\u03bcm, -70 \u00b1 2\u03bcm and \u201390 \u00b1 2\u03bcm, obtained from machining \ntolerances. \n \n \n \nThe object was profiled using the PM-LCFSI system with a sample interval of 10\u03bcm, so that the results \ncould be compared with those from the standard fibre LCFSI system using the same step interval. Once \nagain, there were some problems with specular reflections saturating regions of the camera, and this is \ncharacterized by rather sparse data density within a narrow \u2018bow-tie\u2019 shaped region across a diameter of \nthe mesh profile shown in figure 9. Planar equations were fitted to the data from each level, and the \nstandard deviation in the depth of the fitted plane was found to be about 11\u03bcm. Measured step heights \nagreed with independent measurements, taking into account this uncertainty, which is comparable with \nthe step interval of 10\u03bcm. \n \n(a) (b) \nFigure 7. (a) Photographic image taken in white light and (b) 3D mesh plot acquired using PM-LCFSI of a UK 5 \npence coin, 18 mm in diameter.  The surface of the coin has been etched in a weak acid solution. \nFigure 8. Schematic of stepped test object, made from a machined aluminium bar. \nLow-coherence optical fibre speckle interferometry \n 15\n \n \n \n5.2 Temperature sensitivity \nTemperature sensitivity was once again a concern in this system. Since light propagates in only one linear \npolarization mode of the polarization-maintaining fibre, the temperature stability calculation is essentially \nidentical to that used in assessing the standard fibre system, and the normalized sensitivity has the same \nvalue of 190 radoC-1m-1. Coincidentally, the mismatch in fibre lengths is also very close to that for the \nstandard fibre system, and so the temperature sensitivity turns out to be about the same, at 57 radoC-1. We \ntherefore conclude once again that, for optimum stability, the polarization-maintaining fibre system \nshould be enclosed in a temperature-stable environment provided by hermetically-sealed packaging. \n \nAs discussed in section 3.1 above, alternative optical sources have become available over the last few \nyears, with excellent characteristics for use in low-coherence systems. These include both the new \ngeneration of superluminescent diodes, available with bandwidths up to tens of nanometres for powers up \nto about 50 mW, and supercontinuum sources with bandwidths in excess of 100 nm. Such sources could \nreplace the pulsed MMLD in the profiling systems described in this paper, and would be likely to lead to \nan increase in depth resolution and improved signal-to-noise performance. \n \n6. Conclusions \n \nThe use of optical fibre components in low-coherence speckle interferometry has been shown to alleviate \nmany of the experimental difficulties encountered in constructing bulk-optic systems. Optical path lengths \nmuch greater than the actual physical path lengths within the system can be achieved without difficulty, \nallowing larger objects to be illuminated with fibre-based systems. Long path-length interferometers \nconstructed using fibre are also less susceptible to disturbances caused by vibration or mechanical \ninstabilities of the optical mounts. Path-length matching between the signal and reference arms is  \nachieved more readily, and portable, flexible, small \u2018footprint\u2019 instruments can be constructed. On-axis \nimplementations of fibre systems are possible, which will allow these systems to see through holes in the \ntest surface, to any additional surface below. \nThe main disadvantage of fibre implementations is their greater sensitivity to ambient temperature \nfluctuations than the bulk-optic systems. However, this can be minimized by enclosing instruments in \nthermally insulated enclosures, or by employing a phase-control feedback system [46]. The optical \nFigure 9. 3D mesh plot acquired using PM-LCFSI of the stepped test piece, with a step interval of 10\u03bcm. \nLow-coherence optical fibre speckle interferometry \n 16\ndispersion of the fibres will limit resolution for very broadband sources. However, for the source \nbandwidths used in this study, laser noise and not dispersion was the limiting factor on resolution. \nThe system constructed from polarization-maintaining fibre offers the additional advantage of eliminating \nsignal fading, caused by a relative drift between the polarization states of signal and reference beams. If \nthe reference mirror is mounted on the test object, problems caused by bulk motions of the test piece \nrelative to the interferometer are also eliminated, resulting in a more rugged system, and the path-length \nmatching condition can be recovered with only slight readjustment when the test object is changed or \nmoved. \nThe experimental measurements presented in this paper, using a pulsed MMLD source with a coherence \nlength of about 165 \u03bcm, have demonstrated a depth resolution of \u00b120 \u00b5m for the standard fibre system \ndescribed, and a resolution of \u00b114 \u00b5m for the system based on polarization-maintaining fibre. The \nimprovement seen for the polarization-maintaining system is attributed largely to the elimination of noise \nin the images due to polarization variations. The depth ranges of our systems were limited by depth of \nfocus of the imaging system or by the scanning range of the translation stage used for path matching. \n \nAcknowledgments \nThis work was supported by a grant from  the Royal Society UK. \n \n7.
