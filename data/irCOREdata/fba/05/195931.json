In this report, we demonstrate, in the pancreatic \n\u03b2-cell line MIN6 and islets of Langerhans, that agents which stimulate increases in cAMP, such \nas glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP1) or forskolin, lead to the phosphorylation of rpS6 exclusively \nat Ser(235\/236) independently of the activation of the currently known in vivo rpS6 kinases via a \npathway that is sensitive to inhibitors of cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA). This cAMP-dependent \nrpS6 kinase activity is also sensitive to PKI in vitro and PKA exclusively phosphorylates \nrecombinant rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) in vitro. Taken together, we conclude that PKA can \nphosphorylate rpS6 exclusively at Ser(235\/236) in vivo in pancreatic \u03b2-cells, thus providing a \npotentially important link between cAMP signalling and the regulation of protein synthesis. \nLastly, we provide evidence that PKA is also likely to phosphorylate rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) in \nvivo in a number of other mammalian cell types.  \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe Eukaryotic 80S ribosome is a macromolecular complex composed of a small 40S subunit, which \ndecodes the mRNA, and a large 60S subunit, which is involved in peptidyl transfer. In higher \neukaryotes, the 40S ribosomal subunit is made up of an 18S RNA and a total of 33 proteins, many of \nwhich are phosphorylated \n1; 2\n. However, of these phosphorylated proteins, ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) \nhas received the most attention as its phosphorylation is rapidly induced in response to nutritional, \nhormonal and mitogenic stimuli and it was the first identified substrate for p70S6K (S6K1) \n3\n. \n \nrpS6 is phosphorylated by S6K at the C-terminus on Ser236, Ser235, Ser240, Ser244 and Ser247 in \nvitro \n4\n, which correspond to sites phosphorylated in vivo \n5\n. Deletion of the S6K (dS6K) gene in \nDrosophilia is embryonic lethal; however, a few flies survive and these have reduced body mass as a \nresult of a smaller cell size rather than cell number \n6\n. Mammalian cells express two isoforms of S6K, \nS6K1 and S6K2, each encoded by a separate gene \n7\n and in mice, deletion of the S6K1 gene (S6K1\n-\/-\n) \nis not lethal but the mice are significantly smaller than their wild type counterparts due to decreased \ncell size rather than decreased cell number \n7\n \n8\n. In contrast, mice in which the S6K2 gene is deleted \n(S6K2\n-\/-\n)\n \nshow a normal body and cell size compared to wild type littermates \n9\n. Mice in which both \nS6K1 and S6K2 (S6K1\n-\/-\n\/2\n-\/-\n) were deleted have a similar phenotype to that of S6K1\n-\/-\n mice but show \na significant decrease in viability compared to the S6K1\n-\/-\n mice \n9\n. Importantly, especially in relation to \n2 \n \nthis study, the phosphorylation of rpS6 appears to play a particularly significant role in controlling \npancreatic \u03b2-cell size and function  as S6K1-\/- mice and knock-in mouse in which all five \nphosphorylatable serine residues within rpS6 are substituted to alanines (rpS6\nP-\/-\n) have comparatively \nsmaller pancreatic \u03b2-cells, which co-insides with diminished levels of pancreatic insulin, \nhypoinsulinemia and impaired glucose tolerance \n8\n \n10\n. \n \nS6K2 is the predominant S6 kinase as growth factor induced phosphorylation of rpS6 at Ser(235\/236) \nis reduced and phosphorylation at Ser(240\/244) is undetectable in hepatocytes derived from S6K2\n-\/- \nknock-out mice \n9\n.  In  S6K1\n-\/-\n\/2\n-\/-\n knock-out mice, a proportion of rpS6 remains phosphorylated on \nSer(235\/236), revealing the presence of another in vivo rpS6 Kinase \n9\n. This was identified as p90 \nribosomal S6 kinase (Rsk) \n9\n \n11\n, a kinase that had previously been named due to its ability to readily \nphosphorylate rpS6 in vitro \n12\n. \n \nAlthough extensively studied, the molecular mechanism by which rpS6 phosphorylation exerts its \neffects has proved enigmatic. It was originally thought to stimulate the recruitment of 5\u2019TOP (5' \nterminal oligopyrimidine tract) mRNAs onto polysomes \n13. However, the translation of 5\u2019TOP \nmRNAs is unaffected in hepatocytes from both S6K1\n-\/-\n\/2\n-\/- \nknock-out mice \n9\n and rpS6\nP-\/-\n mice\n 10\n. A \nrecent study provided evidence that site specific phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) via Rsk \npromotes cap-dependent translation by facilitating the formation of pre-initiation translation \ncomplexes \n11\n.  \n \nThe Glucagon like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor \n(GPCR) super-family, which can couple to Gs  containing heterotrimeric G proteins leading to the \nactivation of adenylyl cyclase and the subsequent increase in the production of cAMP \n14\n. The GLP1R \nis highly expressed in pancreatic \u03b2-cells and is activated by the hormone GLP1, where it poteniates \nglucose stimulated insulin secretion, increases \u03b2-cell mass and improves \u03b2-cell function. These \nproperties have made GLP1 the subject of intensive investigation as a potential treatment for type-2 \ndiabetes. Interestingly, GLP1R activation potently stimulates S6K \n15\n. Therefore, GLP1 may promote \nincreases in \u03b2-cell mass, at least in part, through increases in the phosphorylation status of rpS6. For \nthis reason, we set out to investigate the signalling mechanism by which GLP1 stimulates rpS6 \nphosphorylation in pancreatic \u03b2-cells. In the process, we identified PKA as a third in vivo ribosomal \nkinase which specifically phosphorylates rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) in \u03b2-cells and in a number of other \ncell types tested.  \n \nResults \n \nInhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase reveals that GLP1 and forskolin can stimulate the \nphosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) via a S6K independent mechanism.  In order to investigate \nthe role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in GLP1 stimulated phosphorylation of rpS6 in \npancreatic \u03b2-cells, MIN6 cells, a pancreatic clonal \u03b2-cell line 16, were incubated with glucose, GLP1 \nor forskolin (an activator of adenylyl cyclase) in the presence or absence of the PI3K inhibitors \nLY294002 or wortmannin. Glucose, GLP1 and forskolin led to a significant increase in the \nphosphorylation of S6K, as determined by a shift in its mobility, the phosphorylation of rpS6 on \nSer(235\/236) and Ser(240\/244) and the phosphorylation of PKB on Ser473 (figure 1a-c). Both \nLY294002 and wortmannin blocked glucose, GLP1 or forskolin stimulated phosphorylation of PKB, \nS6K1 and rpS6 on Ser(240\/244). Glucose stimulated phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) was \nalso blocked by LY294002 or wortmannin (figure 1a). Surprisingly, however, GLP1 and forskolin \nstimulated phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) was unaffected by the PI3K inhibitors (figures 1b \nand c). To confirm that GLP1 stimulated phosphorylation of rpS6 at Ser(235\/236) was indeed \nindependent of both S6K1 and 2, we determined the activity of S6K1 and 2 in response to GLP1 in \nthe presence and absence of LY294002.  GLP1 led to an increase in both S6K1 and 2 activity, which \nwas effectively inhibited by LY294002 (figure 1d and e). Taken together, these results provide \nevidence that GLP1 and forskolin, agents which elevate cAMP, can stimulate the phosphorylation of \nrpS6 on Ser(235\/236) and Ser(240\/244) by two distinct signalling pathways; where the \nphosphorylation of rpS6 at Ser(240\/244) is dependent upon PI3K, likely mediated via the activation of \n3 \n \nPKB and S6K, whereas the phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) is mediated independently of \nPI3K, PKB and S6K1 and 2. \n \nmTORC1 dependent site-specific dephosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236). To determine whether \nGLP1 and forskolin stimulated phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) is dependent upon the \nactivation of mTORC1, MIN6 cells were incubated with glucose, glucose plus GLP1 or forskolin in \nthe absence or presence of rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTORC1 (figure 2a). Rapamycin \nblocked glucose stimulated phosphorylation of rpS6 at Ser(240\/244) and Ser(235\/236), which \nparalleled the inhibition of S6K1. Rapamycin also blocked GLP1 and forskolin stimulated \nphosphorylation of rpS6 at Ser(240\/244), which again paralleled a decrease in S6K1 phosphorylation \nand significantly reduced\/blocked forskolin and GLP1 stimulated phosphorylation of rpS6 at \nSer(235\/236). These results indicate that GLP1 and forskolin stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation at \nSer(235\/236) is dependent upon mTORC1 activity but independent of S6K1 and 2, the only known \nrpS6 kinases which lies downstream of mTORC1. As anticipated, the phosphorylation of PKB at \nSer473 in response to glucose, GLP1 and forskolin was unaffected by rapamycin (figure 2a).  \nIt has been reported that m(TOR) inhibition by nutrient withdrawal or rapamycin can result in the \nactivation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) \n17\n. Therefore, the rapamycin sensitivity of GLP1 and \nforskolin stimulated phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) could be attributed to the activation of \nPP2A. To investigate this possibility, we determined the effect of okadaic acid (a selective inhibitor of \nprotein phosphatases 1 and 2A) and cantharidin (a selective inhibitor of PP2A) (figure 2b) on \nrapamycin induced inhibition of GLP1 stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation on Ser(235\/236). As \nexpected, rapamycin inhibited GLP1 induced\n \nrpS6 phosphorylation on Ser(240\/244) and \nSer(235\/236). However, okadaic acid and cantharidin, in the presence of rapamycin, dose dependently \nstimulated the restoration of GLP1 stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation on Ser(235\/236), yet had no \neffect on the phosphorylation of\n \nrpS6 on Ser(240\/244) (figures 2b). Collectively, these results provide \nevidence that inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin results in the activation of a phosphatase that \ncould be PP2A, which specifically dephosphorylates rpS6 on Ser(235\/236). Therefore, GLP1 \nstimulated rpS6 phosphorylation on Ser(235\/236) is likely to be independent of mTORC1 activation \nor the activation of its downstream effectors.  \n \nRsk is not responsible for GLP1 stimulated site-specific phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236). p90 \nribosomal S6 kinase (Rsk) is directly phosphorylated and activated by Erk and can specifically \nphosphorylate rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) via an mTORC1 independent pathway in response to growth \nfactor stimulation \n9; 11\n. To determine whether GLP1 stimulated site specific phosphorylation of rpS6 \non Ser(235\/236) is mediated by Rsk, MIN6 cells were incubated with glucose or glucose plus GLP1 \nin the absence or presence of the MEK inhibitor PD-184352 and its effect on GLP1 stimulated rpS6 \nphosphorylation assessed (figure 3a). Additionally, in order to investigate selectively the \nphosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236), cells were also incubated in the presence and absence of the \nPI3K inhibitor LY294002 to block signalling through S6K (figure 3a). As observed previously (see \nfigure 1), LY294002 blocked GLP1 stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation on Ser(240\/244) and had no \nsignificant effect on the phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236). LY294002 treatment also \nstimulated Erk phosphorylation which was effectively inhibited by PD-184352. This LY294002 \nstimulated Erk activity maybe mediated by LY294002\u2019s ability to block Kv currents in pancreatic \u03b2-\ncells \n18\n, which in turn may stimulate Ca\n2+\n influx through L-type VGCC, which is sufficient to \nstimulate Erk activation in \u03b2-cells 19. GLP1 stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation at Ser(235\/236) was \nunaffected by PD-184352 either in the presence or absence of LY294002. Unexpectedly, PD-184352 \nblocked glucose stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation on Ser(235\/236) and Ser(240\/244) . However, we \nfound that PD-184352 activated AMPK, as determined by its increased phosphorylation on Thr172 \nand phosphorylation of a downstream effector acetyl co-carboxylase on Ser79. Increased AMPK \nactivity has been reported to inhibit glucose stimulated mTORC1 signalling and the activation of S6K \nin \u03b2-cells 20. Indeed, PD-184352, possibly via the activation of AMPK, inhibited mTORC1 as \nassessed by the phosphorylation status of two downstream targets of mTORC1, 4EBP1 on Ser65 and \nS6K. Therefore, inhibition of glucose stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation by PD-184352 may be \nmediated by the activation of AMPK and the inhibition of mTORC1. We also observed that other \nMEK inhibitors, U0126 and PD-98059, also activated AMPK in MIN6 cells (unpublished results \n4 \n \n(Moore and Herbert)). Indeed, it has been previously been reported that both PD98059 and U0126 \nactivate AMPK in HELA and HEK293 cells \n21\n. Importantly, PD-184352, at a concentration which \neffectively inhibited GLP1 stimulated Erk phosphorylation, had no observable effect on GLP1 \nstimulated phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser235\/236. Given that these MEK inhibitors also activate \nAMPK, which clearly complicates the interpretation of these experiments, we used an alternative \napproach to inhibit the Erk signalling cascade and hence Rsk. MIN6 cells were infected with \nrecombinant adenovirus encoding Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 3 (AdMPK3), a dual-\nspecific phosphatase that dephosphorylates the activation loop of ERK1\/2 with very high specificity \n22\n, and its effect on GLP1 stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation was assessed (figure 3b). The phorbol \nester TPA, which potently activates Erk and Rsk, was used a positive control (figure 3b). Over-\nexpression of MKP3 effectively blocked TPA induced Erk phosphorylation and the phosphorylation \nof Rsk as assessed by a decrease in Rsk mobility on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Yet, overexpression \nof MKP3 had no effect on GLP1 stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation on either Ser(235\/236) or \nSer(240\/244) in either the presence or absence of LY294002 (figure 3b). Moreover, over expression \nof MKP3 had no effect on glucose stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation on either Ser(235\/236) or \nSer(240\/244) indicating that the effects of PD-184352 on glucose stimulated phosphorylation of rpS6 \nobserved in figure 3a were likely to be mediated by the  activation of AMPK.  \n \nTaken together, these results provide strong evidence that Rsk is not responsible for site specific \nphosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) by GLP1 in pancreatic \u03b2-cells. \n \nNovel\/classical isoforms of PKC are not responsible for GLP1 stimulated site-specific \nphosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236). Given that the phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) in \nresponse to GLP1 is independent of the known in vivo rpS6 kinases, S6K and Rsk, we sought to \nidentify possible candidate kinases that could phosphorylate rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) using a program \nwhich recognises conserved kinase recognition motifs within proteins (group-based phosphorylation \nsite predicting and scoring platform) \n23\n. Several kinases that could potentially phosphorylate rpS6 at \nSer(235\/236) were identified. These included the known S6 kinases S6K and Rsk, as well as PKB, \nPKC and cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA). However, we have already ruled out the possibility that \nS6K or Rsk is responsible for GLP1 stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation on Ser(235\/236). PKB was also \nruled out as GLP1 stimulated phosphorylation of PKB on Ser473 is completely blocked by LY294002 \nyet the phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236)  is unaffected (figure 1). To investigate whether PKC \nis responsible for GLP1 stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation on Ser(235\/236), MIN6 cells were treated \nwith GLP1 in the presence or absence of BIM, Ro320432 or G\u00f66976, selective inhibitors of the \nnovel\/classical isoforms of PKC (PKCn\/c) (figure 4). GLP1 was also added to MIN6 cells chronically \npre-stimulated with TPA to down-regulate both PKCn\/c isoforms (figure 4). To selectively investigate \nthe phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236), cells were also incubated in the presence and absence of \nthe PI3K inhibitor LY294002 to block signalling through S6K. TPA, which acts via the activation of \nboth PKCn\/c, was used as a positive control. As anticipated, chronic pre-stimulation of cells with \nTPA or addition of BIM, Ro320432 and G\u00f66976 blocked TPA induced phosphorylation of Erk1\/2 and \nrpS6 yet had no effect on GLP1 stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation on Ser(235\/236) either in the \npresence or absence of LY294002. As shown previously (figure 1), LY294002 effectively blocked \nGLP1 signalling to rpS6 on Ser(240\/244). These results demonstrate that neither classical or novel \nisoforms of PKC are responsible for GLP1 stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation on Ser(235\/236). \n \ncAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) selectively phosphorylates rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) in vitro. Having \nruled out the possibility that S6K, Rsk, PKC and PKB are responsible for GLP1 stimulated rpS6 \nphosphorylation on Ser(235\/236) (figures 1, 3 and 4), we investigated whether PKA was responsible \nfor GLP1 stimulated selective phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236). Indeed, PKA appeared a \nlikely candidate as PKA is activated by agents that elevate cAMP, such as GLP1 and forskolin, and \nPKA was predicted to selectively phosphorylate rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) in silico. Initially, we \ninvestigated whether the recombinant catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc), or a control active S6K1, \ncould directly phosphorylate rpS6 specifically on Ser(235\/236) in an in vitro kinase assay using a \nGST fusion protein containing the C-terminus of rat rpS6 as substrate (GST-S6). PKAc readily \nstimulated the incorporation of \n32\nP into GST-S6 but not into a mutant rpS6 protein in which Ser(235) \n5 \n \nand Ser(236) were replaced by alanines (GST-S6AA), indicating that PKA exclusively \nphosphorylates rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) (figure 5ai and iii). The stoichiometry of PKA-induced \nphosphorylation of GST-S6 in \nvitro was determined to be 1.74mol\/mol. In contrast, S6K could phosphorylate GST-S6 and \nGST-S6AA (figure 5ai). It has been reported that the phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) \nprecedes the phosphorylation of Ser(240\/244) \n24\n. Therefore, the phosphorylation of rpS6 on \nSer(235\/236) may be required for its subsequent phosphorylation on Ser(240\/244). In order to rule out \nthis possibility, we also investigated if PKAc could stimulate the incorporation of \n32\nP into a mutant of \nrpS6 where Ser(235\/236) were replaced with phospho-mimetic aspartic acid residues (GST-S6DD). \nHowever, neither PKAc or S6K1 was able to phosphorylate GST-S6DD (unpublished results) \nindicating that perhaps the aspartic acids were unable to act as a true phosphomimetic. Therefore, we \nalso looked at the phosphorylation of GST-S6 in vitro by PKAc or S6K1 using phospho-specific \nantibodies. Phosphorylation of GST-S6 by PKAc was readily detectable at Ser(235\/236) but not at \nSer(240\/244) (figure 5b). Therefore, PKA selectively phosphorylate rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) in vitro. In \ncontrast, S6K1 phosphorylation of GST-S6 was detectable at both Ser(235\/236) and  Ser(240\/244). \nThese results are in agreement with a previous report in which the sites of PKA phosphorylation of \nrpS6 in vitro, using purified ribosomes from rats as substrate, were mapped to Ser235 and Ser236 \n25\n. \n \nEvidence that PKA phosphorylates rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) in vivo. Agents that lead to an increase in \ncAMP also lead to the site specific phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) via a S6K, Rsk and \nPKCn\/c independent mechanism. Additionally, we show that PKA, which is activated by elevated \nlevels of cAMP, effectively and selectively phosphoylates rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) in vitro. To \ndetermine whether GLP1 and forskolin treatment resulted in the activation of an in vitro rpS6 kinase \nactivity, rpS6 kinase activity was assayed, using either recombinant GST-S6 or GST-S6AA as \nsubstrates, in lysates from MIN6 cells treated with GLP1 or forskolin in either the absence or presence \nof LY294002 and PD-184352 to inhibit both S6K and Rsk activity (figure 6a). Both GLP1 and \nforskolin treatment led to an increase in S6 kinase activity compared to control lysates as determined \nby increased \n32\nP-incorporation into GST-S6. This activity was also undiminished in lysates from cells \ntreated by LY294002 and PD-184352. However, the addition of the PKA inhibitor PKI effectively \nblocked this in vitro rpS6 kinase activity, demonstrating that PKA is the major in vitro S6 kinase \nfound in cell lysates treated with either GLP1 or forskolin. Moreover, GLP1 or forskolin was unable \nto stimulate the incorporation of\n 32\nP into GST-S6AA, demonstrating that this S6 kinase activity is \ndirected solely towards Ser(235\/236). \n \nTo provide further evidence that PKA is an in vivo rpS6 kinase MIN6 cells were treated with GLP1 or \nforskolin in the presence or absence of the cell permeable selective adenylyl cyclase inhibitor \nMDL12,330A and PKA inhibitor H89 (figure 6b and c). Both MDL12,330A and H89 inhibited GLP1 \nand forskolin stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation. In addition, cells were treated with a penetratin linked \ncell permeable PKI peptide (PKIRR) that specifically inhibits PKA or, as a negative control, a \npenetratin linked PKI peptide in which 2 arginine residues, critical for binding of PKI to PKA \n26\n, were \nreplaced by alanines (PKIAA) (figure 6d). PKIRR but not PKIAA effectively inhibited forskolin \nstimulated rpS6 phosphorylation. PKIRR but not PKAAA also inhibited GLP1 stimulated \nphosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) in the absence or presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY29002. \nThis data, along with the results presented in figures 1 to 5, provide strong evidence that PKA acts as \nan in vivo rpS6 kinase. \n \nEvidence that PKA phosphorylates rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) in islets of Langerhans. In order to provide \nevidence that PKA is able to phosphorylate rpS6 in primary \u03b2-cells, rat islets of Langerhans were \nincubated with glucose, glucose plus GLP1 or forskolin in the presence or absence of the PI3K \ninhibitors LY294002 or wortmannin (figure 7a), the MEK inhibitor PD-184352 (figure 7b) or the \nmTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin (figure 7c). Glucose, glucose plus GLP1 and forskolin all led to \nincreases in the phosphorylation of rpS6 (figure 7). Glucose and glucose plus GLP1 also led to \nincreases in PKB phosphorylation (figure 7a). Glucose stimulated phosphorylation of rpS6 and PKB \nwas inhibited by LY294002 and wortmannin (figure 7a). GLP1 and forskolin stimulated \n6 \n \nphosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(240\/244) was also blocked by LY294002 and wortmannin as was \nGLP1 stimulated PKB phosphorylation (figure 7a). However, GLP1 and forskolin stimulated \nphosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) was resistant to both LY294002 and wortmannin indicating \nthat cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) is independent of S6K in islets (figure \n7a). GLP1 stimulated phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) was also resistant to PD-184352 at a \nconcentration that effectively inhibited TPA induced phosphorylation of Erk, indicating that \nphosphorylation of this site is also independent of Rsk in islets (figure 7b). To provide evidence that \nPKA is an in vivo rpS6 kinase in islets, islets were treated with GLP1 in the presence or absence of the \nselective PKA inhibitor H89 (figure 7c). H89 inhibited GLP1 stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation on \nSer(235\/236) and Ser(240\/244). H89 had no effect on the phosphorylation of S6K1 on Thr389. Taken \ntogether, these results provide evidence that Ser(235\/236) is being phosphorylated by a PKA \ndependent mechanism. Similar to the results obtained in MIN6 cells. Rapamycin treatment inhibited \nglucose, GLP1 or forskolin stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation on all sites investigated (figure 7d) , \npresumably through the activation of a phosphatase (see figure 2). These results provide evidence that \nthe phosphorylation of rpS6 in islets by agents which elevate cAMP occurs via a similar, if not \nidentical, mechanism to that observed in MIN6 cells.  \n \nEvidence that PKA phosphorylates rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) in other cell types. In order to investigate \nwhether PKA is also able to phosphorylate rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) in other cell types, the human \nfibroblast cell line NIH3T3, the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, the human \nneuroblastoma cell line  SY-SH5Y, the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 and the \nChinese Hamster Ovarian (CHO) cell line, and as control MIN6 cells, were treated with Forskolin and \nIBMX to elevate cAMP in the absence or presence of H89, LY294002, LY294002 plus PD184352, or \nrapamycin (figure 8). In all cell types tested Forskolin and IBMX stimulated the phosphorylation of \nrpS6 on Ser(235\/236) and this was blocked by H89. Importantly, the phosphorylation of rpS6 on \nSer(235\/236) was resistant to LY294002 or LY294002 plus PD184352 in MIN6 and HEK293 cells \nand partially resistant in PC12, SY-SH5Y,  and NIH3T3 cells. In addition, in HEK293, PC12, SY-\nSH5Y, and NIH3T3 cells the phosphorylation of rpS6 at Ser(235\/236) phosphorylation was also \nresistant to rapamycin. This demonstrates that, in MIN6, HEK293, PC12, SY-SH5Y, and NIH3T3, \nincreases in cAMP can stimulate the phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) via a Rsk and S6K \nindependent mechanism, which is sensitive to H89. Therefore, based on these results and the results \npresented throughout the paper, rpS6 can be phosphorylated on Ser(235\/236) by PKA in a number of \ndifferent cell types. The phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(240\/244) was blocked by LY294002, \nindicating that the phosphorylation of this site is dependent on PI3K and possibly mediated by S6K. \nIn CHO cells the phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) was also blocked by LY294002 indicating  \nthat in this cell type cAMP induced  phosphorylation of rpS6 is likely mediated by S6K. .  \n \nDiscussion \n \nrpS6 was shown to be phosphorylated at multiple sites in response to partially hepatoctomy in rats, a \ntreatment which leads to the rapid increase in protein synthesis \n27\n. The sites phosphorylated on rpS6 in \nvivo were mapped to the C-terminus and identified as Ser235, Ser236, Ser240, Ser244 and Ser247 \n5; 28; \n29\n. Although a number of protein kinases were shown to phosphorylate rpS6 in vitro, including \nprotease-activated kinases, PKC and PKA, these were unable to phosphorylate rpS6 at all the sites \nidentified in vivo and their activation in vivo did not precede increases in rpS6 phosphorylation \n(reviewed by \n1; 30\n). However, a predominant mitogen activated S6 kinase activity, which could \nphosphorylate rpS6 on all 5 sites identified in vivo, and whose activity preceeded the phosphorylation \nof rpS6 in vivo, was isolated and named p70S6 kinase (S6K1) \n4\n \n30\n. In addition, inhibition of mTORC1, \nan upstream activator of S6K1\/2, inhibited the phosphorylation of rpS6 in vivo \n7; 31; 32\n. Therefore, \nS6K(1\/2) was considered to be the only authentic in vivo rpS6 kinase. Examination of the \nphosphorylation status of rpS6 in hepatocytes from S6K1\/2\n-\/- \nmice demonstrated that S6K is the \npredominant rpS6 kinase but also revealed the presence of another in vivo kinase which: 1.) could \nexclusively only phosphorylate rpS6 on Ser(235\/236); 2.) was sensitive to inhibitors of MEK; and 3.) \nwas insensitive to rapamycin \n9\n. This kinase was identified as Rsk, a serine\/threonine kinase that is \n7 \n \nactivated in response to mitogens such as EGF and Serum \n11\n. However, the possibility remained that \nother in vivo rpS6 kinases existed as rpS6 phosphorylation had only been studied in response to a \nlimited number of mitogens, none of which stimulate increases in cAMP, in hepatocytes derived from \nS6K1\/2\n-\/-\n mice and S6K1\/2\n-\/- \nMEFs \n9\n. In this study, we identify PKA as a third in vivo rpS6 kinase and \nshow that this kinase exclusively phosphorylates rpS6 on Ser(235\/236). Interestingly, there are \nnumerous reports demonstrating that agents which elevate cAMP lead to an increase in the \nphosphorylation of rpS6. However, increased cAMP can activate PKB \n33; 34; 35; 36\n, which in turn can \nstimulate S6K1\/2 via the inactivation of Tsc1\/2 and the subsequent increase in  mTORC1 activity \n37\n. \nIn addition, increases in cAMP can also activate the Erk signalling pathway \n38\n, which can, via Rsk, \ndirectly phosphorylate rpS6 \n11\n. Moreover, the Erk signalling pathway can stimulate the activity of \nS6K1\/2 via the inactivation of the Tsc1\/2 and the subsequent activation of mTORC1 \n39; 40; 41\n. \nTherefore, prior to this report, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of rpS6 was likely assumed to be \nmediated by an increase in the activation of Rsk and\/or S6K.  Indeed, in all the cell types we tested, \ncAMP-dependent increases in the phosphorylation of rpS6 at Ser(240\/244) were blocked by the PI3K \ninhibitor LY294002, indicating that phosphorylation at these sites is likely mediated by S6K; \nhowever, in most cases, cAMP stimulated increases in the phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) \nwas resistant to inhibitors of PI3K or MEK but sensitive to H89.Therefore, we believe that cAMP-\ndependent phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236) in pancreatic \u03b2-cells, as well as in many other \ncell types, is mediated by PKA in vivo.  \n \nAgents which stimulate increases in cAMP can either inhibit or stimulate protein synthesis depending \nupon physiological stimuli and cell type. In \u03b2-cells, the GLP1R agonist exendin-4 stimulates protein \nsynthesis via a cAMP-dependent mechanism \n42\n. This is possibly facilitated by PKA-dependent \nphosphorylation of rpS6, as site specific phosphorylation at Ser(235\/236) has previously been shown \nto stimulate preinitiation translation complex assembly and the initiation of cap-dependent translation \n11\n. However, polysomes from livers of rpS6\np-\/- \nmice are similar to those found in WT mice and, \nunexpectedly, the rates of protein synthesis are higher in MEFs derived from rpS6\np-\/-\n mice compared \nto those derived from WT mice \n10\n. Therefore, it is far from clear what role rpS6 phosphorylation plays \nin the regulation of general protein synthesis. GLP1 also stimulates \u03b2-cell proliferation, growth, \ndifferentiation and inhibits apoptosis \n14\n. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that PKA-dependent site \nspecific phosphorylation of rpS6 in response to GLP1 plays an important role in the translational \nregulation of a specific subset of transcripts involved in one or more of these processes. Indeed, \nevidence from rpS6\np-\/-\n and S6K1\n-\/-\n mice demonstrates that the phosphorylation of rpS6 plays a \nparticularly important role in the growth and function of the pancreatic \u03b2-cell 8; 10. The \u03b2-cells from \nthe rpS6\np-\/- mice are smaller in size but total \u03b2-cell mass is unaffected due to increased \u03b2-cell number \n10\n. Yet both pancreatic insulin content and circulating levels of insulin in rpS6\np-\/- \nmice is half of that \nfound in WT mice \n10\n. Although similar phenotypic changes were observed in the S6K1\n-\/-\n mice, \ndecreases in insulin were attributed to a decrease in \u03b2-cell mass\/volume 8. As cAMP signalling to rpS6 \nis unaffected in S6K1\n-\/- \nmice, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of rpS6 cannot compensate for the loss \nof S6K1. However, PKA dependent phosphorylation of rpS6 may still play a role in stimulating \nincreases in \u03b2-cell mass in response to specific cues. Moreover, the volume of individual \u03b2-cells from \nrpS6\np-\/- \nmice is 35% smaller than its wild type counterpart \n10\n, whereas the volume of individual \u03b2-cells \nfrom S6K1\n-\/- \nmice is 24% smaller than its wild type counterpart \n8\n. Unfortunately, there is no data \navailable on the volume of \u03b2-cells from S6K1-\/-\/2-\/- mice but \u03b2-cell size is unaffected in S6K2-\/- mice. \nTherefore, the increased \u03b2-cell volume observed in S6K1-\/- mice compared to the \u03b2-cells from rpS6p-\/- \nmay be due to the maintained phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser(235\/236), possibly mediated by PKA. \nHowever, it is as well conceivable that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of rpS6 may play a role \ndistinct from translation as a number of ribosomal proteins have been shown to have extra ribosomal \nfunctions \n43\n. \n \nPP2A is a major Ser\/Thr phosphatase consisting of a catalytic (c) and scaffolding (A) subunit \n(reviewed in \n17). It\u2019s substrate specificity and subcellular localization is mediated by regulatory B \nsubunits. In yeast, Tap42, when phosphorylated by TOR, binds to and inhibits PP2Ac. Rapamycin \ntreatment causes dissociation of this complex, resulting in PP2Ac directing its activity towards \ndownstream targets of TOR. In mammalian cells, PP2Ac has been found to associate with a homolog \n8 \n \nof Tap42 called \u03b14, also in a rapamycin-sensitive fashion. Moreover, in Jurkat cells, PP2A is activated \nby rapamycin treatment or nutrient deprivation, resulting in a decrease in the phosphorylation of \ndownstream targets of mTORC1 \n44\n. PP2A is likely to play an important role in nutrient regulated \u03b2-\ncell function and nutrient secretagogues such as glucose inhibit PP2A in \u03b2-cells (reviewed in 45). \nInterestingly, we provide evidence that a phosphatase, likely PP2A, is also activated by inhibition of \nmTORC1 in \u03b2-cells. We show that the activation of this phosphatase in response to rapamycin results \nin the dephosporylation of rpS6 specifically on Ser(235\/236). We suggest that the inhibition of \nmTORC1 caused by a decrease in glucose concentration would activate PP2A and play an important \nrole in \u03b2-cell function.  \n \nIn conclusion, we have identified PKA as a third in vivo rpS6 kinase that specifically phosphorylates \nrpS6 on Ser(235\/236) in response to GLP1 in pancreatic \u03b2-cells. This is likely to be a paradigm for \ncAMP dependent signalling to rpS6 in response to other physiological stimuli which induce increases \nin cAMP not only in \u03b2-cells but in other cell types. This work also provides a potentially important \nlink between cAMP-dependent signalling and protein synthesis. \n \nMaterials and Methods \n \nReagents.

Penatratin coupled PKI peptides (PKI-\nRR:TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIDHDAARQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK   and PKI-\nAA:TTYADFIASGRTGAANAIDHDAARQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK ) were designed by Professor \nChris Proud, University of Southampton, UK and generated by Dr G. Bloomberg, Department of \nBiochemistry, Bristol university, UK. Adenovirus expressing MKP3 was kindly provided by \nProfessor Phillip Pratt, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical College of Wisconsin, \nUSA. \n \nCell Culture and Treatments. In this study, MIN6 cells (kindly provided by Prof. Jun-Ichi Miyazaki) \nwere used between passages 25-50 at ~80% confluence. MIN6 cells were grown in DMEM \ncontaining 25mM glucose supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum, 100 g\/ml \nstreptomycin, 100units\/ml penicillin sulphate, 75 M -mercaptoethanol and 40mM sodium \nbicarbonate, equilibrated with 5% CO2, 95% air at 37\u00b0C. Prior to treatment, cells were serum starved \novernight. The medium was then removed, the cells were washed twice with modified HEPES-\nbalanced Krebs-Ringer\n \nbicarbonate buffer (KRB) ((115mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, 10mM NaHCO3, \n2.5mM\n \nMgCl2, 2.5mM CaCl2, 20mM HEPES, pH7.4 supplemented with 0.5X MEM amino\n \nacids \nsolution (50X stock from Sigma), 0.5X MEM non-essential amino acids solution (100X stock from \nSigma), and 0.5X L-glutamine (100X stock from Sigma)) and then incubated for 1h at 37\u00b0C in KRB \nprior to incubation in KRB or KRB containing 20mM glucose or 20mM glucose plus 10nM GLP1 for \na further hour at 37\u00b0C (unless otherwise stated). Full details of treatments are provided in the figure \nlegends. After treatment, the cells were washed with ice cold PBS and then lysed by the addition of \nice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% triton, 10mM -glycerophosphate, 50mM tris-HCl pH7.5, 1mM \nEDTA, 1mM EGTA, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 1mM benzamidine-HCl, 0.2mM \nphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1\u00b5g\/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 0.1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and \n50mM sodium fluoride (unless otherwise stated). The lysates were then centrifuged for 10min at \n16000 x g. The supernatants were kept and total protein concentrations were determined by the \nBradford assay (Bio-Rad). The protein lysates were stored at \u201380\u00b0C until further analysis.  \n \nIslet Isolation and Culturing. Pancreatic islets were isolated from 200-250g male Sprague Dawley rats \nby collagenase digestion and Histopaque density gradient centrifugation as previously described \n46\n. \nIslets were cultured\n \nfor 16h\n \nin RPMI 1640 containing 5.6mM glucose,\n \n100 units\/ml penicillin and \n100\u00b5g\/ml streptomycin.  Prior to treatment, islets were washed twice with KRB buffer minus glucose. \nThe cells were then incubated for 2h at 37\u00b0C in KRB buffer containing 2mM glucose prior to \nincubation in KRB buffer containing 2 or 20mM glucose for the times indicated in the figure legends \n9 \n \n(full details of treatments are provided in the figure legends). After treatment, islets were collected\n \nby \ncentrifugation for 1min at 200 x g and\n \nlysed by the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer.       \nConstruction of Plasmids. pGST-S6AA, where Ser235 and Ser236 were changed to alanines, and \npGST-S6DD, where Ser235 and Ser236 were changed to aspartic acid, were generated by site-\ndirected mutagenesis using pGST-S6 (a bacterial expression plasmid encoding GST fused to the C-\nterminal of rat rpS6) as template. Site-Directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange \nmutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). \nProtein Expression. The pGST-S6 constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli (strain Rosetta \nBL21) and grown in Luria-Bertani Broth (LB) at 37\no\nC. Protein production was initiated after the cells \nhad reached OD600 of 0.9 by the addition of 1mM isopropyl \u03b2-D thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). After \n3h, the cells were collected by centrifugation for 15 minutes at 5000 x g at 4\u02daC. The cells were then \nresuspended in 2\u20135 ml of lysis buffer (5% glycerol (v\/v), 1M KCl, 20mM Tris HCl pH8.0, 3mM \nMgCl2, 5mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 5mM NaF, 1mM PMSF, leupeptin (1\u03bcg\/ml), pepstatin (1\u03bcg\/ml), \n0.1% triton) per gram of pelleted cells (wet weight) and\n \nthen sonicated. Bacterial\n \ndebris was removed \nby centrifugation at 16000 x g for 15 minutes at 4\u02daC. The fusion proteins were then isolated from the \nsupernatants using glutathione Sepharose beads (Amersham) according to the manufacturer\u2019s \ninstructions. The proteins were eluted using Elution Buffer (lysis buffer containing 20mM reduced \nglutathione) and dialysed against: 5% glycerol (v\/v), 100mM KCl, 20mM Tris HCl pH7.5, 5mM \u03b2-\nmercaptoethanol, 5mM NaF, 1mM PMSF, 1\u03bcg\/ml leupeptin, 1\u03bcg\/ml pepstatin.          \n \nS6K1 and S6K2 Kinase Assay.  MIN6 cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50mM HEPES\n \npH \n7.5, 150mM NaCl, 1% (v\/v) Nonidet P-40, 2mM EDTA,\n \n50mM sodium fluoride, 10mM sodium \npyrophosphate, 1mM sodium\n \northovanadate, 0.1\u00b5g\/ml of leupeptin, 0.1\u00b5g\/ml of pepstatin, 1mM \nphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,\n \nand 3mM benzamidine. Whole-cell extracts were centrifuged\n \nat 16000 \nx g for 10min at 4\u00b0C, and endogeneous S6K1 or S6K2\n \nwere immunoprecipitated with the anti-S6K1 \nor anti-S6K2 antibody\n \nimmobilized on protein G-Sepharose beads. Immune complexes were washed \nthree times with lysis\n \nbuffer followed by a single wash with kinase assay buffer (50mM HEPES pH \n7.5, 10mM MgCl2, 1mM dithiothreitol, 10mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate).\n \nThe kinase reaction was initiated \nby resuspending the beads\n \nin 25\u00b5l of kinase assay buffer supplemented with 1\u00b5M\n \nPKI (Calbiochem), \n50\u00b5M ATP, 1\u00b5Ci of [\n32P]\u03b3ATP and 6\u00b5g of GST-S6. The reaction was carried out at 30\u00b0C for 10min \nand terminated by the\n \naddition of Laemmli\n \nsample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5min at 100\u00b0C and \nseparated by SDS-PAGE. \n32\nP-labelled GST-S6 visualised by autoradiography. Labelled GST-S6 \n\u2018bands\u2019 were excised from the gel and 32P-incorporation into GST-S6 measured by Cherenkov \ncounting. \n \ncAMP-dependent Kinase Assays Using GST-S6 as Substrate. In vitro phosphorylation of the GST-S6 \nand mutants by the\n \nPKA catalytic subunit (PKAc) was carried out according to the manufacturer's \nrecommendations (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Briefly, reactions containing 3\u00b5g GST-S6, 1\u00b5Ci of \n[\u03b3-32P]ATP, 5\u00b5l ADBI buffer (40mM MOPS pH 7.0, 1mM EDTA) and recombinant PKA diluted in \n20mM MOPS pH7.0, 1mM EDTA, 0.01% Brij-35, 5% glycerol, 0.1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 1mg\/ml \nBSA were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for\n \n10min under constant\n \nagitation. The kinase reactions were stopped \nby addition of Laemmli\n \nsample buffer. For rpS6 kinase assays using cell lysates, MIN6 cells were \ntreated as described above and in the figure legends. Kinase reactions containing 20\u03bcg cell lysates, \n3\u03bcg of the recombinant GST-S6 (or GST-S6AA) coupled to GST beads (GE Healthcare), 1 \u03bcCi of \n[\n32\nP]-\u03b3ATP, 12 \u03bcM MgCl2, 12 \u03bcM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, in the absence or presence of 1 \u03bcM PKI, were \nincubated at 30 \u00b0C for 1 h under constant agitation. GST beads were washed twice in lysis buffer prior \nto the addition of Laemmli sample buffer.  \n \nIn all cases, samples were boiled for 5min at 100\u00b0C and the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. \n32\nP-\nlabelled GST-S6 was visualised by autoradiography. Labelled GST-S6 \u2018bands\u2019 were then excised \nfrom the gel and \n32\nP-incorporation into GST-S6 measured by Cherenkov counting. \n \n10 \n \nSDS-PAGE and Western Blotting.

All results presented are representative of at least 3 independent experiments. \n \n \nFigure 1\nGlucose 20mM\nP-rpS6 S235\/236\nP-PKB S473\nP-rpS6 S240\/244\nErk 2\nS6K1\nC - 10 \u03bcM LY2940025 20\n50 100 nM wortmannin\n--\n--- -\nai\nGLP1\nP-rpS6 S235\/236\nP-PKB S473\nP-rpS6 S240\/244\nErk 2\nS6K1\nC - 10 \u03bcM LY2940025 20\n50 100 nM wortmannin\n--\n--- -\nbi\nForskolin\nP-rpS6 S235\/236\nP-PKB S473\nP-rpS6 S240\/244\nErk 2\nS6K1\nC - 10 \u03bcM LY2940025 20\n50 100 nM wortmannin\n--\n--- -\nci\n[32P] GST-S6\n- +    +     +\n+- - -\nGLP-1\nLY294002\nIP:S6K1 no Ab\nGST-S6\n[32P] GST-S6\n- +    +     +\n+- - -\nIP:S6K2 no Ab\nGST-S6\ndi\nei\nGLP-1\nLY294002\naii\nbii\ncii\ndii\neii\n*\nC GLP1 GLP1 + LY GLP1 no Ab\n0\n1\n2\n3\nS\n6\nK\n1\n A\nc\nti\nv\nit\ny\n C\nP\nM\n %\n o\nf \nC\no\nn\ntr\no\nl\n*\nC GLP1 GLP1 + LY GLP1 no Ab\n0\n1\n2\nS\n6\nK\n2\n A\nc\nti\nv\nit\ny\n C\nP\nM\n %\n o\nf \nC\no\nn\ntr\no\nl\n**\nC FSK FSK + LY FSK + Wort\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\nP\n-r\np\nS\n6\n S\n2\n3\n5\n\/2\n3\n6\n -\n A\n.U\n.\n**\nC Glu Glu + LY Glu + Wort\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\n25000\nP\n-r\np\nS\n6\n S\n2\n3\n5\n\/2\n3\n6\n -\n A\n.U\n.\nC GLP1 GLP1 + LY GLP-1 + Wort\n0\n10000\n20000\n30000\nP\n-r\np\nS\n6\n S\n2\n3\n5\n\/2\n3\n6\n -\n A\n.U\n.\n16\naii\nG\nlu\nb.\n- -\n5\n0\n1\n0\n0\n- 5\n0\n1\n0\n0\nGLP1\nRapamycin\nCantharidin \u03bcM\n- - 0\n.1\n0\n.3\n1\n.0 Okadaic acid \u03bcM\n0\n.1\n0\n.3\n-\n- - - - -\n+     +    +    +    +    +    +    +   + +     +    +    +    +     +   \n+    +    +    + -\n1\n.0\n1\n.0\n+    +    +    +     +   -\n-\n-\nP-rpS6 S235\/236\nP-rpS6 S240\/244\nS6K1\nErk 2\nFigure 2\nai\nP-rpS6 S240\/244\nrpS6\nP-rpS6 S235\/236\nRapamycin\nC G\nL\nP\n-1\nF\ns\nk\nC 2\n0\nm\nM\nG\nL\nP\n-1\nF\ns\nk\nP-PKB S473\nS6K1\n- - - - - - - - - -\n- - - - - - --\n17\n(P)rpS6 S235\/236\nGlucose\nGLP-1\nLY294002\nPD18452\n(P)rpS6 S240\/244\nrpS6\n(P)AMPK\nAMPK\n- + + + + + +\n- - - + + + +\n- - - - - + +\n- - + - + - +\n(P)Erk\nFigure 3 \na.\nGLP-1\nLY294002\nTPA\n- + + + - - + + + -\n- - + + - - - + + -\n- - - + - - - - + -\n- - - - + - - - - +\n(P)rpS6 240\/244\nrpS6\n(P)ERK\nAd MPK3\nGlucose\nRsk\n(P)rpS6 S235\/236\nb.\nRsk\nC\nG\nlu\nG\nlu\n +\n P\nD\nG\nL\nP\n1\nG\nL\nP\n1 \n+ \nP\nD\nG\nL\nP\n1 \n+ \nLY\nG\nL\nP\n1 \n+ \nLY\n +\n P\nD\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\nP\n-r\np\nS\n6\n S\ne\nr\n2\n3\n5\n\/2\n3\n6\n -\n A\n.U\n.
