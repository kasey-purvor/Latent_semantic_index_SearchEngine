INTRODUCTION\nTHE recent discovery of superconductivity in a known,simple binary compound, MgB , with a high super-\nconducting transition temperature of 39 K [1] has\ninitiated worldwide efforts to realize reliable and reproducible\nJosephson junctions in this material in order to exploit its\nunique advantageous properties compared to other similar\ntype of materials [2]. To date, several groups have reported the\nfabrication of Josephson junctions in thin film nanobridges,\npoint contacts, focused ion beam damage, and thin film het-\nerostructures geometries [3]\u2013[8]. Unfortunately, fabrication of\nmanufacturable Josephson junctions in thin MgB films has\nturned out to be rather difficult because of the relatively poor\nfabrication control and lack of reliable barrier materials for\nany multilayer junctions, as well as the technical challenge of\ngrowing high quality thin films.\nThe masked ion damage (MID) technique has been in-\nvestigated extensively by a number of groups as a viable\nfabrication route to create Josephson junctions for its potential\nManuscript received August 6, 2002.

In our pre-\nvious work, we have explored the application of Au masked\n50 keV proton beam irradiation damage process for super-\nconductor\u2014normal\u2014superconductor (SNS) type Josephson\njunctions in YBa Cu O (YBCO) in combination with a\nnanoscale focused ion beam direct milling [11]. Although these\nresults are promising, the technique can be limited by problems\nassociated with mask structures such as broadening effect in\nthe definition of slot width, and nonideal geometric shape of\nthe mask associated with high aspect ratio cut. Here, we report\nour latest results based on an optimized mask structure by\nintroduction of a very thin Si buffer layer in between metal\nmask and the MgB layer.\nThe junctions fabricated in this way display nonhysteretic,\nresistively shunted junction (RSJ) like current\u2014voltage (I-V)\ncharacteristics between of the tracks and 24 K. Microwave-\ninduced steps at expected voltages and an oscillatory magnetic\nfield dependence of critical current were observed. Junctions on\nthe same chip show nearly identical properties over a tempera-\nture range of Josephson coupling.\nII. JUNCTION FABRICATION\nOur sample preparation technique has been described else-\nwhere [12] and will be only briefly reviewed here. B films were\nfirst deposited at room temperature on to (0001) sapphire sub-\nstrates by electron-beam evaporation and then ex situ annealed\nin a Mg vapor at 850 C for 30 min to produce 400 nm thick\nMgB films. These were Ar ion beam milled to a final thick-\nness of 120 nm and of 35 K. As schematically illustrated in\nFig. 1, we first defined a window area in the photoresist to which\napproximately 70 nm of Si layer was applied by dc magnetron\nsputtering at room temperature [See Fig. 1(b)]. After rinsing the\nphotoresist, the films were coated with 360 nm thick Au on the\ntop of Si\/MgB bilayer [Fig. 1(c)]. Tracks and contact pads were\npatterned in the film by conventional optical lithography [Fig.\n1(d)]. The of the tracks prior to further processing was mea-\nsured and still found to be 35 K.\nThe patterned chips were then transferred to FIB system (FEI\nCorporation 200 xP\u00ae) for a mask aperture preparation. The Ga\nion beam had a dwell time of 1 s, a beam spot overlap of\n50%, and an acceleration beam voltage of 30 kV throughout\nthe process. Trenches of single-pixel line were made at 4 pA in\nthe Au. Accurate control of the milling depth was achieved by\nin situ measurements of the track resistance during milling [13]\n[see Fig. 1(e)]. After the metal mask aperture was prepared with\nFIB, the of the tracks was re-measured before final implan-\ntation and was found to be unchanged.\n1051-8223\/03$17.00 \u00a9 2003 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Fabrication sequence for metal masked ion damage weak links.\nThe sample was then mounted on an ion implanter equipped\nwith a custom-made cryogenic stage and shielded to allow ion\nimplantation of the device through a 2 mm aperture. The in\nsitu electrical measurement system and cryogenic sample stage\nin the implanter offer us an accurate control of the implanta-\ntion process at low temperatures. We monitor the time and tem-\nperature dependence of the sample resistance during implanta-\ntion. The maximum operating temperature and dosage are de-\ntermined accurately by monitoring the resistance of the barrier\nat a given temperature and using the resistive transition as an\nendpoint. While monitoring the barrier resistance in situ, the\nsamples are exposed to a 50 keV H ion beam with a nominal\ndose of up to ions\/cm at 20 K (see Fig. 1(f)). This\ntemperature is chosen to ensure that the intended maximum op-\nerating temperature of the completed device is close to the\nof the bulk after room temperature annealing. More detailed in-\nformation on this ion beam damage technology can be found\nelsewhere [14].\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nAfter implantation, the Au on top of the Si layer was com-\npletely removed to eliminate any possible parasitic shunt resis-\ntance caused by a thick Au layer, before electrical characteri-\nzations. of the tracks was re-measured at this stage and was\nstill found to be unchanged. 6 tracks were prepared and their I-V\ncharacteristics were measured over a range of temperatures in a\ndip probe. Microwave radiation and magnetic field were applied\nto assess the quality of the junctions.\nFig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of the critical cur-\nrent of the junctions. Like focused electron beam damage\njunctions, the MID devices exhibit a rapid increase of with\nFig. 2. Temperature dependence of critical current of a junction. Inset:\ncurrent-voltage characteristics of a 3 \u0016m wide junction at 32 K.\ntemperature. This behavior is consistent with existing models of\nSNS junctions with soft boundary conditions [15].\nSmall variation of with temperature from one track to an-\nother were observed even though they were on the same chip\nand thus, received an identical nominal implantation dose per\nunit area. The most likely reasons for this spread are that the\ndegree of focus of the Ga ion beam used to prepare the metal\nmask apertures could vary from place to place on the substrate\nsurface. The effect of defocus will be to broaden the milled\ntrench; this will in turn reduce the ion dose per unit area ex-\nperienced by the MgB film beneath and increase the effective\nbarrier length due to the increased trench width. Film thick-\nness variation which was often found in the same batch could\nalso cause nonuniform critical temperature distribution and dif-\nferent nature of damage with the depth below the film surface\nin the ion-modified weak links as described by Tinchev [16].\nThe inset in Fig. 2 is an example of I-V characteristics of a\njunction at 32 K. The I-V characteristics show the RSJ model\nbehavior with some excess current. The normal resistance was\nnearly temperature independent between the and 24 K and\nwas about 0.25 at 32 K. At 24 K, we have mA and\n, from which a product mV is\nobtained. This value is still much small if compared with the\nvalue mV predicted\nby the BCS theory for K. No significant change in the\njunction properties was observed over 2 months and a number\nof thermal cycles.\nThe Josephson nature of the branch appeared in the\nI-V characteristics is confirmed by the regular appearance of\nShapiro steps (ac Josephson effect) when the junctions are under\nmicrowave irradiation. All tracks show clearly microwave in-\nduced constant voltage steps over a wide temperature range.\nThe steps are observed at voltages , where is\nan integer, is the flux quantum, and is the frequency of\nthe applied radiation. As expected, the voltage steps are found\nto be around 25 V for microwave power at frequency of 12\nGHz. (see Fig. 3). The induced steps exhibit only a slight noise\nrounding. In this case, a total of 8 steps could be observed at\n30.5 K, whereas up to 13 steps were seen at lower temperatures.\nFig. 4 shows the magnetic modulation of the of a junc-\ntion at 34 K\u2014the apparently incomplete suppression of the\nis largely due to the fixed voltage criterion used to assess the .\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Modulation of the critical current by a magnetic field applied\nperpendicular to the current direction, measured at 34 K.\nClose to the coupling temperature of the junctions, the shows\na nearly complete modulation in an applied magnetic field. This\nindicates a homogeneous critical current density across the bar-\nrier and therefore a homogeneous defect distribution throughout\nthe implanted region of the MgB microbridge.\nMonte Carlo simulations have been performed to investigate\nthe effect of the Si layer thickness as a buffer layer on the for-\nmation of irradiation damage profiles inside the MgB thin film\ntarget. Fig. 5 shows the 2 dimensional plots of simulated energy\ndepositions (i.e., damage levels) in MgB . The damage profile is\nnearly uniform in the case where 70 nm of Si layer was inserted\nas a buffer layer. In contrast to this, a very nonuniform damage\nprofile is evident for buffer layer thickness of 200 nm. The sim-\nulation results clearly show that our optimized mask structure is\nvery effective for our purposes.\nAs pointed out in Section I, our previous results on MID junc-\ntions fabricated with 450 nm thick Au metal mask showed some\noutstanding problems associated with such a thick metal mask.\nFirstly, the width of the irradiation damage created in mask layer\nis found to be wider than the nominal width of the slot created\nwith FIB from electrical characterizations. This broadening ef-\nfect was largely due to the extra mask sidewall scattering process\nof energetic projectiles, as revealed from our previous Monte\nCarlo simulation results [17]. The sidewall scattering process is\nintrinsic to the nanometer scale high aspect ratio masked irradi-\nFig. 5.

Ga contamination may\nlead to a suppression of the superconducting properties, and due\nto the diffusive nature of the contamination will result in a broad\nregion of suppression rather than the narrow barrier created by\ndirect implantation damage.\nTo alleviate this problem we considered two approaches. We\ncould use a thick metal mask and leave a layer of about 200 nm\nof Au below the bottom of the trench in which the Ga would\nbe contained during implantation. However, this thick Ga diffu-\nsion buffer layer may destroy the high definition of the masked\ndamage barrier layers, leading to a poor device performance.\nIn addition, the extra metal mask will increase the parasitic\nshunt conductance. An alternative approach is to insert another\n(preferably insulating) layer to act as a Ga diffusion barrier. An\ninsulating layer is advantageous as it allows for endpoint detec-\ntion by the in situ resistance measurement during mask aperture\nfabrication. In YBCO devices we have successfully used this\napproach with a SrTiO layer, however, in MgB oxide layers\nmay lead to degradation of the MgB due to the oxygen content.\nFor MgB we have used a 70 nm thick Si layer to act as the dif-\nfusion barrier.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Si is also found to be\nchemically compatible with MgB \u2014no appreciable degrada-\ntion of MgB over a month was observed. Finally, the Au can be\nreadily removed after implantation since 70 nm of Si can serve\nas an endpoint detection layer during milling process thus elimi-\nnating problems associated with the parasitic shunt conductance\ndue to the thick Au layer.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, high quality MgB metal masked ion beam\ndamage Josephson junctions were successfully realized,\nshowing RSJ-like current-voltage characteristics. Both, dc and\nac Josephson effects were clearly observed by the modulation\nof the critical current by applied magnetic fields and the\nappearance of Shapiro steps under microwave irradiation. Even\nthough we have successfully created Josephson junctions in\nMgB by irradiation damage technology, very little is known\nabout the nature of the defects created during the implantation.\nThus, the precise origin of the weak-link behavior is not well\nunderstood. In the near future, we will attempt to address this\nissue by studying transport properties of a series of resistors\ncreated in this way and by high-resolution transmission electron\nmicroscope investigation at the cross-section of the barrier\nregion. With further optimization of the irradiation dose, our\ntechnique can be a very effective and convenient tool for proto-\ntyping devices due to its simplicity and flexibility of fabrication\nand has a great potential for high-density integration.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
