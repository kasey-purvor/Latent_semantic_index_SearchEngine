Introduction:\nThe proportion of composite structures is increasing in all applications where weight is critical.\nA major effort of the composite industry has focused on eliminating the inherent weakness of\ncomposite materials, namely low delamination resistance. Solutions to improve interlaminar\ntoughness include toughening of the resin, resin interleaving, and more recently through the\nthickness reinforcement including 3D weaving, stitching, tufting and Z-Fiber\u00ae pinning.\nZ-Fiber \u00ae pinning (thereafter referred to as Z-pinning) is the only technique suitable for the\nreinforcement of structures manufactured using the prepreg\/autoclave route. Mouritz recently\nreviewed the effect of Z-pins on composite laminates [1]. The effectiveness of Z-pins to\nincrease delamination resistance [2-9] , impact damage tolerance [10-11] and joint strength\n[12-14] has been demonstrated clearly using both experimental and modelling approaches.\nHowever, not all effects of Z-pinning are positive. The improvement of interlaminar properties\ncomes with a reduction of the in-plane elastic properties (modulus, strength and fatigue\nperformance) [15-19]. For example, Steeves and Fleck reported a drop of compressive\nstrength of at least 30% [19]. Because of this reduction of the in-plane properties, the use of\nZ-pins is limited to the reinforcement of those structures likely to fail by delamination. So far,\nthe use of Z-pins is limited to military aerospace application (F18E\/F) [20] and Formula 1\nracing [21]. In his review, Mouritz states that a number of issues such as durability, modelling\nof structural behaviour and low cost manufacturing need to be resolved before using Z-\npinning to its full potential in civil aerospace applications [1]. This paper reports a study of\nthe delamination behaviour of Z-pin laminates under Mode I and Mode II fatigue loading\nconditions. The results are related to the apparent toughness values obtained under quasi-\nstatic Mode I and Mode II loadings.\n2. Materials\nThe results reported in this paper were obtained by testing laminates made from AS4B\/8552\nprepreg supplied by Hexcel Composites (UK). Thirty two plies of this prepreg were hand laid-\nup, achieving a nominal laminate thickness of 4mm. A 10 \uf06dm PTFE film was inserted in the\nmid-plane to act as a delamination initiator.\nAfter a final debulk at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, the plate was reinforced locally using T300\/BMI Z-pins\nof 0.28 mm diameter . The Z-pins were inserted at two different volume densities: 2%, giving\na pin-to-pin spacing of 1.8 mm and 4%, giving a pin-to-pin spacing of 1.2 mm. The following\nconvention will be used throughout the paper: un-reinforced specimens (control) will be\ndesignated 0%, samples reinforced with Z-pins inserted at a density of 2% ( 4%) will be\ndesignated 2% (4%). The Z-pins were inserted using the UAZ\u2122 (Ultrasonically Assisted Z-\nFiber\u00ae) process described in references [1] and [2].\nFig. 1 shows a typical Z-pinned specimen configuration. A 50 mm long band of Z-pins was\ninserted 15 mm beyond the end of the starter film. After insertion of the reinforcement and\nsubsequent removal of the excess pin length, the laminate was cured in an autoclave at\n180\u00b0C under 7 bar pressure for 2 hours, after a dwell of 1hour at 110\u00b0C.\nCaul plates (top and bottom) were used during cure to ensure good laminate consolidation\nand low thickness variation near the Z-pinned area. As a consequence, the pins have tilted\nduring the compaction of the laminate during the cure, resulting in a pin angle between 20\u00b0\nand 35\u00b0. It is important to note that the pins are not normal to the plane of the laminate as this\nmay have an effect on the phenomena reported in this paper.\nAfter cure, a dry diamond coated circular saw was used to cut 20 mm wide samples for quasi-\nstatic testing and 25 mm wide samples for testing under fatigue loading conditions.\n3. Experimental\n3.1. Test methods\n3.1.1. Mode I\nThe quasi-static tests were performed following the procedure described in ISO15024 [22] at\na constant cross-head speed of 2 mm\/min. All results were first analysed using the corrected\nbeam theory. The data reduction uses a crack length correction factor, \uf0441. This correction\nfactor is added to the crack length in order to account for the deformation in the beam beyond\nthe crack tip. Results from the Z-pinned samples were re-analysed using two different\nanalysis schemes suggested by Robinson and Das [23] and Brunner et al. [24]. The results\nwill be shown and discussed in the following section.\nMode I fatigue tests were performed following a protocol developed recently within the ESIS\nTC4 committee by Pinter [25]. This test procedure is intended for unidirectionally reinforced\nfibre laminates without through-thickness reinforcement. For preliminary tests with this\nprocedure, both displacement and load control were defined. Specimens are first precracked\nfrom the insert film under quasi-static load (displacement control), and subsequently\ndisplacement control loading is used for fatigue. Finally testing switches to load-control fatigue\nfor comparison of the two control modes. (N.B. it is likely that displacement control only will\nbe implemented in the final procedure.) Recommended test frequency is 10 Hz, with an R-\nratio of 0.1, if possible for the specific material and test set-up. Lower frequencies are\nadmissible, but will increase test duration. Delamination propagation is observed visually with\nthe aid of a travelling microscope. Samples may not be removed from the test fixture during\nthe test.\n3.1.2. Mode II\nQuasi-static delamination testing under Mode II loading conditions was performed following\nthe corrected ELS protocol developed within the ESIS TC4 [26]. This procedure is currently\ninvestigated in round robin tests and first results indicate reasonable agreement for unpinned,\nunidirectionally reinforced fibre laminates [27]. The quasi-static tests were carried out at a\nconstant cross-head speed of 0.5 mm\/min. The compliance of the test set-up was measured\nusing the \u2018inverse ELS\u2019 procedure. The test data were then analysed using the corrected\nbeam theory.\nMode II fatigue tests were performed with the same ELS test set-up used for the quasi-static\ntests. Test parameters were adapted from the ESIS TC4 procedure for Mode I fatigue testing\n(R-ratio set to 0.1, test frequency of 5 to 10 Hz desired, effectively as high as possible).\nAgain, fatigue tests on Z-pinned samples were performed under load control only.\n1 The \uf044 factor is the Y=0 intercept of the plot of (C\/N)1\/3 vs. a, where C\/N is the\ncorrected compliance and a the crack length (see [22] for more information).\n3.2. Test set-up and parameters\nQuasi-static and fatigue tests in Mode I and Mode II were mainly performed at one laboratory,\nwith selected fatigue tests performed for the purpose of comparison in the co-author\u2019s\nlaboratory. For the fatigue tests, 0% pin reinforcement samples were tested under\ndisplacement control and Z-pinned samples were tested under load control. Specimens were\neither tested from the insert starter film or from a precrack created by a quasi-static test.\nLoad levels for the fatigue tests were chosen comparable to the loads observed during quasi-\nstatic tests. If delamination propagation was observed to slow down and virtually stop in the\nZ-pinned area of the specimen, the load level was increased and the test continued.\nLaboratory A, equipped with climate control at +23\u00b0C and 50% relative humidity, performed\nfatigue tests on Z-pinned specimens using a servo-hydraulic test machine (Instron type 1273)\nwith a 1 kN load cell calibrated in the load range up to 200 N. Fatigue tests have were\nperformed with frequencies between 1 and 5 Hz under load control, the R-ratio was set to 0.1.\nWith increasing load levels, the test frequency had to be lowered (from 5 to 3, to 2, and finally\nto 1 Hz) in order to achieve the corresponding displacement. Delamination lengths were\nmonitored with a travelling microscope with magnification of 16 times at selected intervals.\nFatigue loading was stopped for this, but the specimen was not removed from the fixture. As\na check on the test, machine data (maximum and minimum load and displacement per cycle)\nwere recorded every 5\u2019000 and 10\u2019000 cycles in the early and later stages of the test,\nrespectively.\nLaboratory B used screw driven Zwick ZN10 with a 2 kN load cell to perform the quasi-static\nDCB and ELS tests. The fatigue tests were carried out using a servo-hydraulic DMS machine\nwith a 10 kN load cell calibrated on the 2 kN range. The maximum frequency achievable with\nthis machine was 1Hz. As for laboratory A, the R-ratio was set at 0.1 and the delamination\ngrowth was monitored visually using a travelling microscope. A specially designed Labview\nprogramme was used to record the compliance, the maximum and minimum loads and\ndisplacements every 1000 cycles.\nLaboratory A used fixed load levels of 50 N for testing from the insert or precrack until the\ndelamination propagation stopped in the Z-pinned area. Then, the load was increased in\nsteps of 50 N (i.e., first to 100 N, then to 150 N, and so on) until a failure of the specimen was\nobserved or the test stopped. A few specimens with nominal width of 20 mm were also tested\nin fatigue. The load levels were scaled with the width for these specimens.\n4. Results\n4.1. Quasi-static tests\n4.1.1. Mode I\nFig. 2 shows the resistance curves of all Mode I tests, with and without Z-pins, analysed using\nthe standard corrected beam theory. Control samples exhibit relatively flat R-curves at an\naverage propagation value of around 310 J\/m2.\nFor all samples, the first 15 mm of crack propagation was through an area which did not\ncontain Z-pins. The apparent toughness2 for all samples ranges from 210 to 280 J\/m2. As the\ndelamination crack approaches the through-thickness reinforcement, the load increases and\nthe apparent toughness increases dramatically. It is noticed that this increase occurs 2 to 3\nmm before the delamination front reaches the Z-pins. The first row of Z-pins is located\nnominally at 65 mm from the load line.\nIn the case of 2% density reinforcement the crack continues to grow through the Z-pinned\narea (see Fig. 3-a) and a plateau value of the apparent toughness is reached (5.1 kJ\/m2 on\naverage). The crack propagation behaviour within the Z-pinned area is variable, depending\non the local 3D architecture. Some specimens exhibited stable crack propagation at high\ntoughness levels. Some others exhibited stick-slip behaviour. Once the crack has passed\nthe pinned area, the crack propagation becomes unstable and the specimen fails by complete\ndelamination as observed by the authors in previous work [2, 3]. Such unstable crack\npropagation could be stopped effectively by a suitably located second Z-pinned area, as\nshown previously by Carti\u00e9 et al. [4].\nIn the case of the 4% density reinforcement, the apparent toughness increases to a level of\napproximately 10 kJ\/m2. Eventually the crack is stopped by the Z-pin bridging actions and the\nspecimen fails by flexure in the beam arms (see Fig.3-b).\n4.1.2. Mode II\nBlackman and co-authors have demonstrated that the ELS test is stable provided that the\nratio of the crack length divided by the initial span (a\/L) is greater than 0.553. Despite an\ninitial (a\/L) ratio of 0.6, the ELS tests performed on the control samples were unstable. The\ninitial loading was linear elastic to failure. The crack propagated to a final length of\napproximately 90 mm, only 10 mm away from the clamping fixture. No propagation data were\nrecorded; therefore no propagation toughness values could be determined. The\ncorresponding initiation toughness value was 980 J\/m2.\n2 Calculated using the standard corrected beam theory taking an average of the\npropagation points excluding the initiation points.\n3 The stability of the test is defined by\n\uf028 \uf029\n0, \uf0a3\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\na\naGII \uf064 , which is equivalent to\n55.063 \uf0bb\uf0b3L\na where a is the crack length and L the loading span.\nThe Z-pinned samples exhibited similar initial unstable crack propagation behaviour within the\nnon-reinforced area. In the unpinned area, the initiation values were 950 J\/m2 for the 2%\nreinforcement and 910 J\/m2 for the 4% pin density, on average. The unstable crack\npropagated a few millimetres within the pinned area before being stopped by the action of the\nZ-pins.\nWith continuing loading, the crack growth behaviour of the samples containing 2%\nreinforcement was stable until the crack reached the clamping fixture. The tests were\nstopped at this point. After data reduction using the corrected beam theory, the resistance\ncurve is continuously rising, until the end of the tests. No steady state propagation was\nreached. The apparent toughness value at this point is in the region of 7.3 kJ\/m2. In the 4%\npin density samples, the crack never re-started and the specimen failed in flexure similarly to\nthe Mode I samples. Using the beam theory, the apparent toughness at the time of failure\nwas in excess of 9 kJ\/m2.\n4.2. Fatigue tests\n4.2.1. Mode I\nThe results of fatigue delamination testing are presented in terms of crack growth rate (da\/dN)\nversus applied GImax (Fig. 4 to Fig. 6). The GImax is calculated with the direct beam theory\ncorrected for large displacement and load block effects using equation 1. An initial\ninvestigation of the determination of the crack length correction factor \uf044, using regression\nanalysis of the data points from fatigue tests, showed high scatter.\nN\nF\nba\nPG ax 2\n3 maxmax\nIm\n\uf064\n\uf03d equation 1\nHere, Pmax (resp. \uf064max) is the applied maximum load (resp. displacement), b is the width of the\nspecimen and a the crack length measured by visual observation. F and N are same the\ncorrection factors for large displacement and finite displacement correction to account for the\nload block effects as for quasi-static testing. The expression of F and N can be found in [22].\nFig. 4 shows the delamination fatigue behaviour of two control specimens tested under\ndisplacement control loading conditions (filled symbols) as well as the behaviour of four Z-\npinned specimens loaded under force control loading conditions with a maximum applied load\nof 50 N (open symbols).\nUnder displacement control, 0),( \uf0a3\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\na\naG \uf064\n. This means that during testing, as the crack\npropagates under constant maximum applied displacement, the applied GImax decreases. In\npractical terms, while the loading is oscillating between \uf064min and \uf064max (both of which are fixed)\nthe crack propagates and the applied GImax decreases: with decreasing loading, the crack\ngrowth rate is expected to decrease. The curve is followed from right to left (grey arrow in\nFig. 4). The control specimens follow a typical Paris-like behaviour, similar to that observed\nby Brunner et al [30].\nUnder load control, 0),( \uf0b3\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\na\nPaG\n. In this case, as the crack propagates under constant\nmaximum applied load, the applied GImax increases. The crack propagation is expected to\naccelerate and da\/dN is expected to increase. This acceleration is observed in Figure 4 in\nthe Z-pinned samples while the crack was propagating in the initial unpinned area. Looking\nat the open symbols, it can be observed that the crack growth rate increases from 10-5 to 10-4\nmm\/cycles for loading increasing from approximately 100 J\/m2 to 130 J\/m2 (highlighted by the\narrow marked load control 0% in Fig. 4).\nWhen the crack front reaches the pinned area, despite an increasing applied load, the crack\npropagation slows down. For all four samples containing through-thickness reinforcement,\nthe crack growth rates decrease to below 10-6mm\/cycles for a similar GImax of 170 J\/m2.\nFig. 5 shows the behaviour of a specimen containing 2% areal density pins when Pmax was\nincreased to 55 N and later to 65 N. With the step increase in the load, crack propagation\ninitially re-starts. In both cases, due to the action of the pins in the crack wake, da\/dN then\ndecreases, the crack propagation slows down. At Pmax = 55 N (GImax of 210 J\/m2), the crack\ngrowth rate decreases to 10-6 mm\/cycles in approximately 80,000 cycles. At Pmax = 65 N\n(GImax of 290 J\/m2), the crack growth rate decreases to 10-6mm\/cycles in approximately\n120,000 cycles.\nFigure 6 summarises all the re-loading steps for the various Z-pinned samples (both 2% and\n4% pinning densities). The crosses or open symbols are plots obtained from testing 4% pin\ndensity specimens whereas the filled symbols are specimens reinforced at 2% pin density. It\nhas to be noted that the position of the deceleration (in terms of applied load) depends on the\napplied load, but not on the density of reinforcement. This is explained by the fact that if the\nreinforcement is sufficient to decelerate the crack propagation rapidly, the crack length does\nnot vary significantly, therefore GImax is controlled by the applied load Pmax.\nWhen the loading is sufficient, or if the crack front has reached the end of the pinned area,\nthe bridging actions of the pins become insufficient to slow down the crack propagation. The\ncrack growth rate increases rapidly and the specimens fail by delamination through their\nentire length within a few cycles. This critical load is 170 N (Gimax= 2.1 kJ\/m2) for the\nspecimen reinforced with Z-Pins at a density of 2%.\nThe final failure occurred by delamination along the length when the load was increased from\n200 N to 250 N. In contrast to the quasi-static test, the delamination propagated through the\nZ-pinned area and no flexural failure of the loading arms was observed.\n4.2.2. Mode II\nFor the Mode II ELS configuration it has been demonstrated that:\n\uf028 \uf029\n55.060\n, 3 \uf0bb\uf0b3\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0db\uf0a3\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\nL\na\na\naGII \uf064\nand\n\uf028 \uf029\n0, \uf0b3\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\na\nPaGII\nalways.\nUsing the same argument as for the Mode I fatigue delamination tests, in load control\nexperiments, as the crack propagates under cycling at constant Pmax, the applied GIImax\nincreases. In displacement control experiments, the applied GIImax decreases, provided that\nthe ratio (a\/L) is greater than 0.55 (i.e., relatively long crack length).\nFigure 7 shows plots of crack growth rate versus applied GIImax for both control and 2% Z-\npinned specimen.\nDue to the difference in loading conditions, it appears that there is a difference in trend\nbetween displacement control (full circles) and load control loading (full triangles) conditions.\nHowever, due to the differences in applied load, it is difficult to know if the two curves are\nconnected.\nThe behaviour of the 2% Z-pinned specimen is similar to that observed in Mode I fatigue\ntesting of Z-pinned laminates. Under load control conditions, the bridging actions of the pins\nslow down the crack propagation. Subsequently, each time the load was increased, the crack\npropagation re-started, but then slowed down again due to the actions of the pins. The tests\nwere stopped when the crack had reached the clamping fixture.\n5. Discussion\n5.1. Data analysis of specimens containing through-thickness reinforcement \u2013\nquasi-static\nAs all the samples were manufactured at the same time and cut out from one large panel, it is\nexpected that the toughness of the un-reinforced portions of the samples should be fairly\nreproducible. A closer observation of the resistance curves of the quasi-static tests shown in\nFig. 2 reveals relatively large scatter in GIC values corresponding to a crack propagating in the\nfirst 15 mm from the insert (i.e., in the un-reinforced area of the specimens; see Table 1).\nThis large scatter may indicate that the corrected beam theory analysis, as described in ISO\n15024, may not be applicable to the analysis of DCB specimens containing through the\nthickness reinforcement. Using the procedure recommended in the ISO standard, the crack\nlength correction factor \uf044 is the intercept of the plot of (C\/N)1\/3 versus a, the crack length. The\nstandard procedure uses all data points available except the initiation points. From Table 1 it\nis apparent that the crack length correction factors \uf044 tend to be higher with higher pin density.\nThe scatter in \uf044 also increases. The large scale bridging due to the pins will have the effect\nof modifying the apparent compliance of the beam, therefore \uf044 will be affected. The back-\ncalculated E-moduli, related to \uf044\uf02c show similar scatter and differ significantly from the value\nobtained from an independent measurement in a three-point bending test. This is an\nindicator of the need to use an alternative data reduction method.\nDue to the specimen configuration, the delamination grows in three different bridging stress\nenvironments. First, the crack grows in an unpinned area. The bridging stresses in the crack\nwake are limited to the \u2018natural\u2019 fibre bridging occurring in standard unidirectional laminates.\nSecond, the crack enters the pinned area, and large scale bridging begins to develop. The\nload increases, the apparent delamination resistance also increases. This is termed \u2018the\ndeveloping zone\u2019 by Robinson and Das [23]. Third, the bridging zone is fully developed as\nthe crack advances through the pinned area. The number of pins acting in the crack wake is\nconstant, as illustrated in Fig. 8 [2]. This may be termed the \u2018developed zone\u2019.\nRobinson has demonstrated that the corrected beam theory analysis provides consistent\ntoughness values for the developed zone provided that the data are analysed in a slightly\ndifferent way: The crack length correction factors \uf044developed must be calculated using data\npoints from the fully developed zone only [23]. Similarly, the toughness values of the\nunpinned area should also be analysed using data points from unpinned area only.\nThis analysis has been implemented and the results are summarised in Table 2. For the\nunpinned area (first 15 mm without initiation points) the \uf04415mm correction factors range from 0\nto 31 mm. The corresponding toughness values now range from 215 to 318 J\/m2. There are\na number of possible reasons for this large scatter.\nFirstly, the regression analysis for the calculation of \uf04415mm is carried out on a limited number\nof points, typically between 5 and 8. The range of different crack extension lengths where this\nregression is performed is also very limited (typically 2 to 13 mm). These two factors will\nincrease the uncertainty of the calculation of the correction factors; a small error in crack\nlength measurement results in a large error in the final \uf044. The same approach has been used\nto calculate the toughness in the plateau area. Table 2 shows that there is a large scatter in\nthe \uf044developed values. This, in turn, introduces a scatter in the toughness values of the plateau\nregion (from 4.1 kJ\/m2 to 5.6 kJ\/m2) which was not apparent when the data were analysed\nusing corrected beam theory. Besides the problems explained above for the calculation of\n\uf04415mm, there is the added problem of unstable, stick-slip behaviour often encountered in the\npinned area. Stick-slip behaviour in unpinned laminates usually results in so-called arrest\nvalues (with very low apparent toughness) which shall be excluded from the analysis\naccording to the ISO 15024 standard. In Z-pinned laminates, whilst the arrest values may not\nbe easy to identify, their exclusion would further reduce the number of data points and\nincrease the difficulty in the extrapolation for \uf044.\nIn order to determine the crack bridging stresses and damage mechanisms occurring in a\nDCB test, Brunner et al. developed an analysis scheme based on compliance (i.e, machine\ndata) and independently determined E-modulus. This scheme, described in [24] relies on\nequation 2 for the determination of GIC.\n3\n1\n1\n1.3\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf03d\nbE\nN\nCbh\nPGIC\n\uf064\n(equation 2)\nIt is to be noted that the crack length does not appear in this equation; an intrinsic effective\ncrack length is used from the measurement of the compliance during the test and the\nknowledge of the flexural modulus of the beam. The average flexural modulus of AS4B\/8552\nwas determined independently from 3 pt bend tests as 120GPa. The stiffness of laminates\ncontaining Z-pins was found to be the same as that of the un-reinforced material.\nThis analysis was implemented assuming that the true compliance of the beam is not affected\nby the presence of the through-thickness reinforcement. The results are presented in Table\n3. Using this analysis, the scatter in the toughness values of the unpinned area is reduced\nfurther (GIC from 275 to 330 J\/m2). The scatter in the \u2018developed toughness\u2019 values is also\nreduced. However, the analysis leads to less conservative values of the apparent toughness.\nThe use of finite element tools to investigate further the validity of the different approaches\nwould lead to a better insight into which analysis to use for delamination tests of laminates\ncontaining through-thickness reinforcement.\n5.2. Overall failure mode of the specimens (static versus fatigue 4%)\nWhen the pin density is increased to 4%, quasi-static tests (displacement control) showed a\ndistinct change in failure mechanism, from delamination to flexural failure of the beam. The\ndelamination was thus stopped inside the Z-pinned area. In load-controlled fatigue tests, this\nwas not the case and the specimen failed by delamination.\nIn order to understand the cause of the failure of the DCB specimens, maximum compressive\nstresses in the upper plies of the arms are calculated using simple beam theory (see Table 4).\nThis analysis reveals that during quasi-static testing of the control specimen, the maximum\ncompression stress is approximately 200 MPa. This stress increases dramatically with the\npresence of through-thickness reinforcement. A stress in the order of 1000 MPa is reached\nduring steady state delamination of 2% pin reinforced specimens. At the time of failure, the\nstress in 4% specimen exceeds 1500 MPa. This value is close to the theoretical compression\nstrength of this type of material.\nDuring fatigue testing, the loads applied range from 50 N to 250 N. This translates to a\nmaximum stress of 140 MPa in the control specimens, 500 MPa in the 2% specimens and\n660 MPa in the 4% samples. These stress levels are sufficiently low to prevent\/avoid flexural\nfailure of the beam.\nFlexural failure depends on the maximum compression stress reached in the upper (or lower)\nplies of the beam. The presence of the through-thickness reinforcement will increase the\nstress in the component by resisting crack; simultaneously, the through-thickness\nreinforcement will reduce the compressive strength of UD laminates, therefore promoting\nearly failure. The use of numerical tools should allow the prediction of the mode of failure of\nstructures containing through-thickness reinforcement to be made, provided that the actions\nof the pins are modelled appropriately.\n5.3. Pin damage mechanisms (static versus fatigue) \u2013 Mode I\nEarly optical observation of the broken samples revealed a change of pin damage\nmechanisms between quasi-static and fatigue failures (see Fig. 9 and Fig. 10) Dai et al. [28]\nhave shown that during quasi-static testing of a Z-pinned DCB, the bridging process contains\nthree stages: first elastic stretch of the Z-pin, then debonding and finally pullout controlled by\nfriction. For perfectly oriented pins (close to 90\u00b0 from vertical), the damage to the pins is\nbelieved to be small. In this study the use of a caul plate during manufacture resulted in a\nfinal Z-pin angle close 30\u00b0. This strongly affects the bridging process and the ultimate failure\nof the pins. The higher magnification SEM of figure 11 shows in more detail the different pin\ndamage mechanisms apparent after quasi-static testing. While some complete pin pullout is\nvisible (Fig 11 a), there is evidence of pins failing in tension and bending (Fig. 11 b). This is\nexplained by the fact that pins inserted at an angle will be subjected to significant bending\nduring the pullout phase.\nLooking at DCB specimens fractured by fatigue loading, none or very little sign of pin pullout\nis noted (see Fig. 3c and Fig. 10). This suggests that different failure mechanisms occur (see\nFig. 12). The fracture surface of the pin is quite planar and transverse to the Z-pin axis. The\nmechanisms promoting this failure mode are not well understood. It is likely that during\ndelamination fatigue, the Z-pins will also be loaded in axial tension-compression fatigue as,\nduring the loading phase of a cycle, tensile forces act on the pins. However, during the\nunloading phase, the pins are pushed back into the laminate, and compression stresses are\nset-up. The pin fracture plane is close to the fracture plane of the DCB specimen and there is\nno evidence of compression failure or buckling of the pin. This Z-pin fatigue failure\nmechanism has not been reported previously and is of significant importance to the prediction\nof fatigue life of a Z-pinned structure. Zhang et al. [29] reported a different Z-pin behaviour\nfrom cyclic pullout testing of blocks of pins. The determination of the correct bridging action\nwill be the key to an accurate life prediction of Z-pinned structures.\n5.4. Displacement versus load control fatigue testing of Z-pinned laminates\nFor Mode I fatigue tests, displacement control is preferred to load control ([30]). However,\nfatigue tests on Z-pinned laminates reported in this study have been carried out under load\ncontrol. This mode of loading was chosen for two main reasons: -\nFirst, this increasing GImax loading with increasing crack length was preferred as any crack\ngrowth slow down can only be attributed to the actions of the Z-pins.\nSecond, load control was chosen to avoid the so called \u2018wedging effect\u2019 reported by\nGraftieaux et al. [31].\nUnder displacement control, during the loading phase of a fatigue cycle, the pins are\nsubjected to tensile load. During the unloading phase of the cycle, as the minimum\ndisplacement (fixed from the onset of the test) was reached, the pins were under compressive\nstresses. The closure of the crack mouth tends to push the pins back in their socket. Due to\nthe shear lag effect, it was impossible to push the pins in completely. Graftieaux and co-\nauthors observed that the debonded pins acted as a wedge in the wake of the crack resulting\nin a tensile stress field at the crack tip and negative minimum load values PMIN were recorded.\nDespite this observation, an improvement of fatigue crack growth is reported for both Mode I\nand Mode II loading conditions.\nUnder load control, the crack closing displacement during the unloading part of the cycle is\nstopped as soon as the bridging pins produce a resistance equivalent to 10% of the maximum\nload (for R = 0.1). This action limits potential damage to pins and laminate due to\ncompressive pin loading (e.g., pin bending or buckling). During this study, a significant\nincrease of the minimum displacement associated with the minimum load (fixed from the\nonset of the test) was observed while the crack propagated through the pinned area, also\nindicating that the pins are not pushed back fully in their socket. The effects of displacement\ncontrol and their dependence on the Z-pinning parameters (e.g., pin density) still require\nfurther investigation.\n6. Conclusions\nLocal reinforcement of laminate beams by both 2% and 4% areal densities of Z-pins has been\nshown to slow down the fatigue crack propagation under Mode I and Mode II under load\ncontrol conditions. Contrary to quasi-static tests, no change in failure mode is observed for\n4% pin density under fatigue loading.\nUnder Mode I loading conditions, the energy absorbing mechanisms related to the Z-pins are\nchanged from pullout or tensile failure to planar transverse fracture with the change of loading\nconditions from quasi-static to fatigue.\nAt present, the only effect of the pin density increase from 2 to 4% is a change in the\nmaximum fatigue load (from 170 N to 250 N for a 25 mm wide sample).\nMore Mode II and mixed Mode I\/II testing is required in order to understand fully the\nbehaviour of Z-pins during fatigue delamination. It is expected that the pin bridging action will\ndegrade under cyclic loading. It is therefore possible that the fatigue crack propagation will\nreinitiate after a finite fatigue life.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank Mr D.
