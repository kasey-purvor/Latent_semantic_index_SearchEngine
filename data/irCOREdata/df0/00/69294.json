During the observation of non-practised actions, the mirror neuron system (MNS), consisting of inferior parietal and ventral premotor areas, was more strongly activated than for the practised actions. This finding indicates a strong role of the MNS in the early stages of imitation learning. In addition, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was selectively involved during observation and motor preparation of the non-practised chords.

Behavioural work on sequence learning (Bird and\nHeyes, 2005; Vogt, 1995) and force field adaptation (Mattar and\nGribble, 2005) indicates that even during pure observational\npractice, learners engage neurocognitive systems for motor\nplanning and control (for review, see Vogt and Thomaschke,\n2007). Using a variety of neurophysiological and neuroimaging\nmethods, the neural mechanisms involved in these processes have\nbeen intensely studied over the last 15 years (for review, see\nRizzolatti and Craighero, 2004; Iacoboni, 2005). It was shown that\naction observation indeed evokes activations not only in higher\norder visual areas but also in areas traditionally known to be\ndevoted to motor functions. The commonly accepted interpretation\nis that the observed action is directly matched with the observer's\nown motor prototype of this action (Rizzolatti et al., 2001). In the\nhuman brain, two regions have been identified that subserve this\nperception\u2013action matching: the caudal part of the inferior frontal\ngyrus including the adjacent ventral premotor cortex and the rostral\npart of the inferior parietal lobule. This circuit involved in\nperception\u2013action matching has become known as the \u201cmirror\nneuron system\u201d (MNS) and is likely to subserve more than a single\ncognitive function (Rizzolatti, 2005a; Wilson and Knoblich, 2005).\nWhereas the early neuroimaging studies on the MNS were\naddressing perception\u2013action matching during action observation,\nthe study by Iacoboni et al. (1999) demonstrated that theMNS is also\ninvolved in movement imitation. However, relatively simple,\noverlearned actions were used in this initial study and subsequent\nimitation research (Iacoboni, 2005). Arguably, such acts do not\nrepresent the typical situation faced when learning a novel, complexing of hand actions: Effects of practice and expertise, NeuroImage (2007),\n2 S. Vogt et al. \/ NeuroImage xx (2007) xxx\u2013xxx\nARTICLE IN PRESSaction that is not yet in the observer's behavioural repertoire. Thus,\nuntil recently, the hypothesis that the MNS also subserves imitation\nlearning (Jeannerod, 1994) remained untested. In order to explore\nthe related neural circuits, Buccino et al. (2004a) conducted a fMRI\nstudy where non-guitarists were asked to imitate unfamiliar guitar\nchords\u2014a task chosen to represent the initial stage of imitation\nlearning. This study yielded two main results. First, the MNS was\nstrongly activated in the imitation condition in all three phases of a\ntrial, action observation, motor preparation and execution. Second,\nthe left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, most likely area 46)\nwas found activated mainly during motor preparation of imitative\nexecution.\nThe first finding was unlikely to reflect the well-documented\ncapability of the MNS to represent meaningful actions (Rizzolatti\nand Craighero, 2004) because the chords were abstract spatial\nconfigurations for the non-guitarist participants. More likely, the\nobserved elementary motor acts, in this case the posture of\nindividual fingers located on the fretboard, were represented in the\nMNS. Thus, the observed motor cortical engagement presumably\nreflected \u201clow-level resonance\u201d between visual and motor repre-\nsentations rather than \u201chigh-level resonance\u201d (Rizzolatti et al., 2002;\nRizzolatti, 2005b). In the chord task, the elementary acts (fingers)\nwere simultaneously present in the display, which facilitated the\nsegmentation. Even more complex forms of \u2018behavioural parsing\u2019,\nspecifically in sequential actions, do not need to rely on an un-\nderstanding of the observed agent's intention but can be con-\nceptualised in more mechanistic terms (Byrne, 2003). The recent\nstudy by Borroni et al. (2005) provides an elegant demonstration of\nlow-level resonance when observing cyclic hand movements.\nBuccino et al. (2004a) interpreted the involvement of the left\nDLPFC to indicate the selection and combination of the individual\nmotor elements, as represented in the MNS, into a new motor\npattern. Recent behavioural work (Hazeltine et al., in press) has\nshown that in the learning of configural actions, such as chords on\nthe guitar or piano, indeed individual hand configurations are\nlearned and not just a generalised capacity for visuomotor matching.\nWe pursued four major aims with the present study: Since the\nDLPFC had not been previously reported to be involved in imitation\nlearning, our first aim was to replicate the original finding of\nBuccino et al. (2004a) for unfamiliar chords. Secondly, if their\ninterpretation of the role of left DLPFC is correct, activations in this\nregion should be reduced when the displayed chords are practised.\nTo this end, all participants were given a practice session with four\nchords one day before the scanning and were tested on imitating the\npractised as well as four non-practised chords during scanning.\nThirdly, we predicted that also activations in the MNS would be\nreduced for the practised chords, relative to the non-practised\nchords. Our rationale for this prediction was the expected reduced\ntop-down input from the DLPFC to the MNS, together with reduced\nattentional demands to identify elementary finger postures and their\ncombination since the practised chords should be available both\nvisually and motorically as complete units (for a review of practice-\ndependent activation changes, see Kelly and Garavan, 2005).11 Alternatively, it is conceivable that activations in the MNS might be\nstronger for rehearsed than for novel movements, as recently demonstrated\nby Cross et al. (2006) during the observation of complex dance sequences.\nHowever, their study involved a substantially longer practice period than\nours and action observation during fMRI was not followed by execution.\nTherefore, it is not straightforward to derive predictions from these results\nfor our study.\nPlease cite this article as: Vogt, S., et al., Prefrontal involvement in imitation learn\ndoi:10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2007.07.005Finally, we also studied a group of expert guitarists, to whom all\nchords were familiar, using the same experimental protocol. Given\nthe results of previous studies on expertise effects (Calvo-Merino et\nal., 2005, 2006), we were interested in the level of activation in both\nthe MNS and in prefrontal areas relative to the non-guitarists, and\nwhether the guitarists might exhibit a different pattern of regional\nactivations due to their extensive motor experience and\/or the\nmeaningful context (music) that the chord task represented for them.\nMaterials and methods\nParticipants\nThirty-two healthy, right-handed volunteers (aged 19 to\n38 years) participated in the study. The non-guitarists (eight males\nand eight females, mean age 26.6 years) did not play any musical\ninstrument. Amongst the guitarists (eight males and eight females,\nmean age 27.3 years), 11 participants were recruited from the\nMusikhochschule Aachen and had at least 10 years of experience\nplaying the guitar. The other five guitarists were recruited locally\nand had between three and 10 years of guitar experience. All but\none had specialised in classical guitar. Two additional participants\nwere excluded from the analysis due to large head movements\n(N5 mm) or undue hand movements in the observation and\nbaseline events. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal\nvisual acuity. They gave their written informed consent to the\nexperimental procedure, which was approved by the local Ethics\nCommittee.\nDesign and experimental conditions\nAll participants attended a practice session outside the MRI\nscanner and, one day later, the main experimental session which\nincluded the scanning. In the practice session, they learned to\nimitate a set of four chords (set A or set B) under conditions that\nresembled the setup in the scanner. In the scanning session, the four\npractised chords were used together with a set of four non-practised\nchords. Half of the participants had practised set A and the other\nhalf had practised set B. The scanning session was divided into\nfour blocks of 16 trials each. Each block consisted of two\nsubblocks in which each of the eight chords of sets A and B was\nshown once in quasi-random order. Thus, each chord was shown\neight times during the scanning session. In half of the trials,\nparticipants physically executed the presented chord (imitation\ncondition, IMI) on a scanner-suitable guitar neck, and in the other\nhalf they imagined executing the chord without overt movement\n(motor imagery condition, MIM). IMI and MIM trials were\npresented in quasi-random order, and they were indicated by a\nsmall green or red square that was presented centrally for 2 s before\nthe start of each trial. The results of the MIM condition are not\nreported in the present paper. Thus, the effective design consisted\nof the factors chord type (non-practised vs. practised chords) and\ngroup (non-guitarists vs. guitarists).\nEach trial consisted of four events. In Event 1 (observation),\nparticipants were required to carefully observe a video clip\nshowing the right hand of a guitarist that repeatedly performed\nthe same guitar chord. In Event 2 (preparation), a blank blue screen\nwas shown, and participants were instructed to visualise the finger\npositions of the chord and to map these to the fingers of their left\nhand. This mapping was facilitated by the mirror-symmetric\narrangement of the video clips (Koski et al., 2003). Throughouting of hand actions: Effects of practice and expertise, NeuroImage (2007),\n3S. Vogt et al. \/ NeuroImage xx (2007) xxx\u2013xxx\nARTICLE IN PRESSEvents 1, 2 and 4, the participants' fingers rested on the fretboard\nin a standard rest position. During the last second of Event 2, a\ncross of the same colour as the square cue was shown in the center\nof the screen to remind participants of the task and to indicate that\nEvent 3 was about to start. In Event 3 (imitative execution or motor\nimagery), the screen colour changed to a darker blue that matched\nthe background of Event 1, and participants either imitated the\npreviously seen chord in a rhythmical manner with their left hand,\nor they engaged in motor imagery of the same action while their\nhand remained in the rest position. At the end of imitative\nexecution, participants returned their fingers to the rest position. In\nEvent 4 (rest), the same background as in Event 2 was shown.\nParticipants returned their fingers to the rest position if they had not\nalready done so and disengaged from the task while keeping their\nhand still.\nIn order to be able to analyse the three main events (Events 1, 2\nand 3) of each condition separately, an event-related design was\nused. Events 1, 2 and 4 were presented in different (\u201cjittered\u201d)\ndurations across trials (Events 1 and 2 = 4 to 10 s, Event 3 = 7 s;\nEvent 4 = 6 to 16 s), and conditions were presented in quasi-\nrandom order. The task and presentation of events in the imitation\ntrials was thus identical to condition IMI in Buccino et al. (2004a),\nexcept that chords could be practised or non-practised, and that the\naverage duration of Event 2 now matched that of Events 1 and 3 to\nallow for contrasts between events.\nApparatus and stimuli\nThe same apparatus was used as described in Buccino et al.\n(2004a), including a short wooden guitar neck without strings\n(height 20 cm), a Sony PX20 data projector and Presentation\nsoftware (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc.) to display the visual\nstimuli. A subset of the video clips from the previous study was\nused. Set A and set B each consisted of one chord involving two\nfingers and three chords involving three fingers. Participants did\nnot see their hand during scanning. For later scoring, each\nparticipant's hand was videotaped during the scanning session,\nsynchronous with an image of the displayed stimuli. This served\nthe scoring of imitation quality and the elimination of individual\nevents or trials where participants did not follow instructions (i.e.,\nany overt movement during Events 1, 2, or 4; no execution during\nevent 3). As a result, 7.6% of all events were eliminated in the non-\nguitarist group and 7.3% in the guitarists. Since Event 4 was used\nas baseline for most contrasts, particular attention was paid to any\nfinger movement during this event, which accounted for 61% of all\nexcluded events. In addition, the last 400 ms of Event 3 and the\nfirst 2 s of Event 4 were principally removed from the analysis\nsince in this interval participants repositioned their hand on the\nfretboard.\nFor the practice session, the scanner setup was replicated in a\nseparate room. Participants were lying on a bed, and stimuli were\npresented on an Eizo 15-in. flat panel display that was mounted\napproximately 60 cm above the participant's head. The model\nstimuli could be swapped against a life image of the participant's\nhand, providing visual feedback that was used in a small subset of\nthe practice trials.\nInstruction and procedure\nAt the beginning of the practice session, which was\napproximately 90 min long, participants were introduced to thePlease cite this article as: Vogt, S., et al., Prefrontal involvement in imitation learn\ndoi:10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2007.07.005guitar fretboard to the hand's rest position, and to the observation,\npreparation and execution events of a trial. This was followed by\ntwo practice phases of 72 imitation trials each with the four chords\nof either set A or set B. The practice trials included trials with\nimmediate visual feedback of the hand during execution (1\/6 of\ntrials), trials with delayed visual feedback (4 s after the onset of\nexecution; 1\/6 of trials) and trials without visual feedback as in the\nscanner (4\/6 of trials). Participants were instructed to observe the\nmodel chords attentively and to reproduce them with maximal\naccuracy and in the same rhythmical manner as shown in the video\nclips.\nThe main experimental session commenced with a further\npractice phase of 24 imitation trials, followed by another 24 trials\nin which participants learned to engage in motor imagery instead of\novert execution of the chords. Then, a full block of 16 trials was\nrun which exactly resembled the procedure in the four scanning\nblocks. These procedures lasted about 30 min and were followed\nby the main scanning session.\nIn order to assess practice effects behaviourally throughout the\nexperiment, speeded performance tests were run at four time\npoints. Participants performed the four practised chords as fast as\npossible over a period of 1 min in a depicted sequence that was\ndifferent in each test. The first was run half way through the first\npractice phase, the second at the end of the second practice phase,\nthe third directly before scanning and the last in a posttest after the\nscanning.\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging\nFunctional MR data were acquired with a 1.5-T Siemens\nSonata whole-body scanner with echoplanar imaging (EPI) cap-\nability using the standard radio-frequency head coil. Multislice\nT2*-weighted echo-planar images were obtained from a gradient-\necho sequence with the following parameters: echo time TE=\n66 ms, repetition time TR=3 s, flip angle=90\u00b0, field of view\nFOV=200 mm, slice thickness=4 mm, inter-slice gap=0.4 mm,\nin-plane resolution=3.125\u00d73.125 mm2. The 29 slices covered the\nwhole brain from the cerebellum through to the vertex. For\nEvents 1, 2 and 3, n=37 EPI-volumes were acquired per con-\ndition and participant and for Event 4, n=53 EPI-volumes were\nacquired.\nImage processing, statistical analysis and anatomical localisation\nThe entire data analysis was performed with SPM2 (Statis-\ntical Parametric Mapping software; The Wellcome Department of\nImaging Neuroscience, London, UK; http:\/\/www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk)\nrunning on MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA). The\nfirst four images of each run were discarded to allow for T1\nequilibration effects. For each participant, all volumes were\nspatially realigned to the first volume of the first session and un-\nwarped to correct for between-scan motion, and a mean image\nfrom the realigned volumes was created. This image was spa-\ntially normalised to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)\nEPI brain template available in SPM2. The thereby derived\nspatial transformation was then applied to the realigned T2*-\nweighted volumes, which after normalisation were resampled in\n2\u00d72\u00d72 mm3 voxels using sinc interpolation in space.

Vogt et al. \/ NeuroImage xx (2007) xxx\u2013xxx\nARTICLE IN PRESSData were analysed using a random-effects model (Friston et al.,\n1999), implemented in a two-level procedure. In the first level,\nsingle-subject fMRI responses were modeled in a general linear\nmodel (GLM) by a design matrix comprising the onsets and\ndurations of each event according to the experimental condition\nfor each session (Events 1, 2 and 3 of the four conditions IMI\/np,\nIMI\/pr, MIM\/np and MIM\/pr). The 12 regressors modeling these\nevents were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response\nfunction. Six additional regressors were included into the GLM to\naccount for voxel intensity variations due to absolute head\nmovements, and one further regressor was included to model\nincorrect events which had to be excluded from their proper task\nregressors. Parameter estimates for all regressors were obtained\nby maximum-likelihood estimation. In the second level, corre-\nsponding contrast images of the first stage for each participant\nwere entered into one-sample t-tests to compute statistical maps\nfor each event of each experimental condition (\u2018basic contrasts\u2019).\nIn addition, direct contrasts between events (1 vs. 2 and 2 vs. 3)\nand between chord types (practised vs. non-practised) were\ncomputed per participant and were also entered into one-sample\nt-tests on the second level. All between-groups comparisons\nwere performed by means of two-sample t-tests. The results\nreported are significant at pub0.001 (uncorrected for multiple\ncomparisons).

Fig. 1 shows the results for\nspeeded performance. Both groups exhibited pronounced practice\neffects across the four tests (F=52.92, pb0.001), and the guitarists\nperformed this task substantially faster than the non-guitarists\n(F=50.28, pb0.001). In addition, guitarists showed stronger\nimprovements with practice than non-guitarists, as indicated by a\nsignificant interaction term in the related 4\u00d72 ANOVA (F=3.33,\npb0.05; linear trend F=6.43). In the posttest, where performance\nof practised (pr-) and non-practised (np-) chords was directly\ncompared, both groups performed the np-chords significantly\nslower than the pr-chords, as indicated by a separate 2\u00d72 ANOVA\n(F=59.09, pb0.001). This difference was more pronounced in the\nguitarists, as confirmed by a significant interaction between group\nand chord type (F=6.35, pb0.05).\nThe rating of imitation quality was based on transcripts of the\nfinger positions in tablature format, which had been extracted from\nthe video recordings. On a scale of 0 to 8, the non-guitarists\nachieved a mean score of 5.3 for the non-practised chords and of\n5.8 for the practised chords, and the guitarists achieved scores of\n6.0 and 6.6, respectively. The corresponding 2\u00d72 ANOVA\nindicated a significant effect of group (F=11.09, pb0.01). In\naddition, the practised chords were performed more accurately than\nthe non-practised chords (F=14.66, pb0.001).

Thus, two crucial preconditions of the study\nwere clearly met.\nFunctional data\nCommon and differential activations between events\nThe activations common in action observation, preparation and\nexecution are shown in Fig. 2 (top panel) and Table 1 (overall\nconjunction between Events 1 to 3 across all participants and both\nchord types). All three events induced strong activations in the\nrostral sector of the inferior parietal lobule bilaterally, which\nextended to left BA2 and right human intraparietal area 2 (\u2018hIP2\u2019,\nsee Choi et al., 2006; Eickhoff et al., 2006a,b). In addition, small\nfoci of increased neural activity were found in the superior parietal\nlobule and in the right posterior inferior temporal gyrus. In the\npremotor cortex, two distinct foci were present bilaterally. The first\nwas located in the ventral part of the precentral gyrus, extending to\nthe dorsalmost part of the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal\ngyrus. The second focus (labelled \u2018PMd\u2019 in Fig. 2) was located in\nthe caudalmost part of the superior frontal sulcus bilaterally and\nextended dorsally to the border between the superior frontal gyrus\nand the precentral gyrus. Furthermore, the supplementary motor\narea (SMA) was found activated across events, as well as the left\ninsula, the caudal part of the middle frontal gyrus and the\ncerebellum (subcortical activations are not considered further in the\npresent paper).\nThe major increases in activation between events are shown in\nthe bottom panel of Fig. 2 in the form of two superimposed direct\ncontrasts. From Event 1 to Event 2, activation increases were\npresent in the primary sensory-motor areas bilaterally, the parietal\noperculum, the insula, the SMA and in prefrontal areas. From\nEvent 2 to Event 3, further increases can be seen in the righting of hand actions: Effects of practice and expertise, NeuroImage (2007),\nFig. 2.

Increased activations across events\nare only reported for areas where the related direct contrast was\nsignificant. The main effects of chord type and group and the\nmodulations in prefrontal regions are described in subsequent\nsections.\nAs expected, the activations in the non-guitarists for the non-\npractised chords (NG\/np, see Fig. 3, top left panel) closely\nresembled those in the corresponding IMI-condition in Buccino et\nal. (2004a) for each of the three events: During action observation2 Decreases of activation from Event 1 to Event 2, not shown in Fig. 2,\nwere mainly found in visual areas. From Event 2 to Event 3, widespread\ndecreases were present across the frontal lobe, as well as in posterior\nparietal areas and the middle and inferior temporal gyrus.\nPlease cite this article as: Vogt, S., et al., Prefrontal involvement in imitation learn\ndoi:10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2007.07.005(NG\/np-1), occipital and posterior temporal regions were found\nactivated in addition to the core pattern of posterior parietal and\npremotor activations in the conjunction analysis. During motor\npreparation (NG\/np-2), the parieto-premotor circuits remained fully\nactivated despite the absence of further visual input. The inferior\nparietal activations now extended further ventrally to the left\nparietal operculum (\u221256, \u221218, 20Z=4.28), \u2018OP 1\u2019 according to\nEickhoff et al.

The activations in\nventral precentral gyrus (\u221258, 6, 32Z=6.37; 60, 8, 30Z=3.97) extended\nto the ventral part of pars opercularis of inferior frontal gyrus (vPO;\n52, 10, 10Z=4.25), most likely BA44. The dorsal premotor\nactivations now extended caudally into precentral gyrus (\u221232,\n\u221216, 58Z=6.01 and \u221230, \u221210, 60Z=5.94; 28, \u221218, 64Z=5.93). In\naddition, the mesial wall (\u22124, \u22124, 62Z=6.16) and insula (\u221232, 20,\n2Z=4.89) were now strongly activated. Finally, a further activation\nfocus was present over the right primary motor cortex (36, \u221222,\n56Z=6.90) in Event 2, which represents the only discrepancy to our\nearlier study. During action execution (NG\/np-3), the parietal and\npremotor activations remained highly similar to those in Event 2,\nwith further activation increases in the parietal operculum OP 1\n(\u221254, \u221222, 24Z=5.32; 56, \u221218, 14Z=5.00), insula (\u221240, 6, \u22122Z=5.66;\n42, 4, \u221210Z=6.01 and 42, 6, \u22122Z=5.72), right postcentral gyrus (36,\n\u221236, 70Z=4.99) and right primary motor cortex (40, \u221222, 56Z=6.77).\nThe activations of the guitarists closely resembled those of the\nnon-guitarists (Fig. 3). The following differences and similarities\nare worth reporting: When the guitarists observed the non-practised\nchords (G\/np-1), the activation in the left ventral precentral gyrusing of hand actions: Effects of practice and expertise, NeuroImage (2007),\n3 The inverse main effect of chord type (prNnp) indicated extended\ndifferential activations in mesial frontal areas, with local maxima in\nsuperior frontal gyrus (medial and medial orbital parts) and anterior\ncingulate gyrus. Also small sectors of the left angular gyrus, right posterior\nmiddle temporal gyrus and anterior middle and inferior temporal gyrus were\nmore strongly activated for the practised chords. The mesial frontal and\nanterior temporal activations were also present in Events 2 and 3. However,\nnone of these activation differences corresponded to positive activations in\nthe related basic contrasts.\nTable 1\nConjunction between Events 1, 2 and 3: Local maxima of activated areas as shown in Fig. 2 (top panel), given in MNI standard brain coordinates [ATB: most\nprobable anatomical region in the Anatomy Toolbox 1.4, Eickhoff et al., 2005; asterisks (*) denote assigned areas]\nAnatomical region Left Right\nx y z Z-score ATB x y z Z-score ATB\nInferior parietal lobule \u221242 \u221238 44 inf. 20% BA2 40 \u221240 42 7.82\nPostcentral gyrus \u221242 \u221244 56 inf. 40% BA2*\nHuman intraparietal area 2 40 \u221244 52 7.68 20% hIP2\nSuperior parietal lobule \u221214 \u221260 66 6.04 16 \u221260 64 5.90\nInferior temporal gyrus 62 \u221252 \u221216 3.97\nPrecentral gyrus (PMv) \u221254 6 36 4.66 30% BA6 56 10 36 3.67 20% BA6\nSuperior frontal gyrus \/ precentral \u221222 \u22124 68 6.59 60% BA6* 26 \u22124 56 5.59 20% BA6\ngyrus (PMd) \u221224 \u22128 56 5.88 30% BA6\nSupplementary motor area \u22122 10 52 4.35 70% BA6*\nMiddle frontal gyrus (caudal) \u221238 38 28 3.65 46 40 28 3.79\nInsula \u221230 20 2 3.35\nCerebellum (Crus I) \u221244 \u221252 \u221234 3.88 40 \u221252 \u221232 5.27\nCerebellum (Crus II) \u22124 \u221280 \u221238 4.52\nCerebellum (VI) \u221228 \u221262 \u221230 3.78 30 \u221262 \u221232 5.03\n6 S.

In Event G\/np-2, the activations in the non-guitarists\nwere again closely matched by the guitarists, including the\nextension of inferior parietal activations into the parietal operculum\nOP 1 (\u221254, \u221220, 26Z=5.41) and postcentral gyrus (\u221242, \u221234,\n56Z=6.79; 36, \u221234, 48Z=6.26), the activations in ventral precentral\ngyrus (\u221254, 6, 42Z=4.81; 54, 8, 40Z=4.96) and increases in inferior\nfrontal gyrus (dPO: \u221256, 8, 28Z=5.09; 56, 12, 30Z=4.70 and vPO: 56,\n10, 10Z=5.65), the caudal-wards shift of the dorsal premotor\nactivations (\u221228, \u221212, 60Z=6.73; 32, \u221216, 58Z=6.67), the increased\nactivations in the mesial wall (10, \u22124, 62Z=6.67) and insula (\u221244, 4,\n10Z=5.95), as well as the strong activation in the right primary\nsensory-motor areas (44, \u221222, 60Z=7.13). The latter, unexpected\nfinding did not primarily reflect motor preparatory processes\ntriggered by the cue 1 s prior to execution, as a reanalysis over the\nfirst 5 s of Event 2 revealed virtually the same activation pattern.\nDuring motor execution, the guitarists again showed highly similar\nactivations to the non-guitarists. It is noteworthy that in all four\nconditions of Event 3, both the ventral part of PO of inferior frontal\ngyrus (\u221256, 8, 8Z=inf.; 58, 10, 8Z=inf) and the insula (\u221240, 2, 2Z=inf;\n44, 4, 6Z=inf) exhibited robust activations (coordinates for the main\neffect of Event 3 across groups and chord types).\nA further, only partial commonality across groups was the\nbilateral activation of the dorsalmost sector of the hippocampus\nduring observation of the practised chords (NG\/pr-1: \u221224, \u221230,\n2Z=4.28 and \u221216, \u221228 \u22128Z=3.83; 24, \u221230, 2Z=3.98; G\/pr-1: \u221224,\n\u221232, 0Z=4.33; 28, \u221230, \u22122Z=4.36).

Finally, during\nmotor execution, cortical activation differences between chord\ntypes were only present in the inferior parietal lobule bilaterally.\nCompared to the main effect of chord type, the group\ndifferences were distinctly small. During action observation, the\nmain effect of group indicated stronger activations for the guitarists\nin the right precentral gyrus (14, \u221224, 66Z=3.94), as well as small\nfoci in the supplementary motor area, the right posterior middle\ntemporal gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus. The non-guitarists\nshowed stronger activations only in the right superior parietal\nlobule (18, \u221270, 56Z=3.68). During motor preparation, the guitarists\nexhibited stronger activations in left inferior parietal lobule (\u221256,\n\u221246, 50Z=3.75), right precentral gyrus (48, 4, 52Z=3.55), superior\nfrontal gyrus (24, 22, 62Z=3.27) and right anterior inferotemporal\ngyrus (62, \u221214, \u221228Z=3.31). During motor execution, the guitarists\nshowed stronger activations in the left inferior parietal lobule (\u221256,\n\u221242, 46Z=3.75) and in the right parietal operculum OP 4 (62, \u22126,\n8Z=3.30). Conversely, the non-guitarists did not show any enhanced\nactivations during Events 2 and 3.\nOnly a small set of regions was activated in the interaction\ncontrasts between group and chord type. These regions were either\nnot activated in the related basic contrasts (e.g., the left anterior\ninferior temporal gyrus in Events 1 and 2; left rostral middle frontal\ngyrus in Event 3), or they were not of primary interest in the\npresent context (e.g., extrastriate occipital cortex, right precentral\ngyrus and SMA in Event 2).ing of hand actions: Effects of practice and expertise, NeuroImage (2007),\nFig. 3.

In the left hemisphere, a rostral and a caudal focus\nwere found in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), whereas in the right\nhemisphere, only the caudal part of the MFG was activated. Each of\nthese regions exhibited a characteristic pattern of modulation by\nevent, chord type and group (Fig. 3). These patterns were quantified\nby extracting the percent BOLD signal change for each condition at\nthe local maxima within these regions (Fig. 5). The related, four-\nfactorial ANOVA indicated a significant overall effect of chord type\n(F=10.95, pb0.01), which was modulated by event, by area and by\nthe combination of event, area and group. Second, the interaction\nbetween event and area was highly significant (F=24.75, pb0.001).\nIn the left MFG, robust positive activations were only present in\nEvents 1 and 2, with a significant increase between these events in\nthe left rostral MFG only. In contrast, the right caudal MFGwas only\nmarginally activated during Event 1 but showed sustained activity\nduring Events 2 and 3 (see Figs. 3 and 5).\nSimple effect analyses of the percent BOLD signal change, run\nseparately for each combination of event and area, indicated that\nthe effects of chord type were largely restricted to the left rostral\nMFG (Events 1 and 2), with only marginal or non-significant\neffects for the two caudal sites. This is backed-up by the contrast\nmaps for non-practised vs. practised chords (Fig. 4), where the left\nrostral MFG showed a strong differential activation in Event 1,\nwith smaller foci in the two left prefrontal sites in Event 2.\nFinally, during action observation the non-guitarists tended to\nshow stronger BOLD signal intensities than the guitarists in all\nthree prefrontal areas. This trend reversed during motor pre-\nparation, as confirmed by a significant interaction between event\n(1 vs. 2) and group (F=8.57, pb0.01).dinates of local maxima of activated areas as shown in Fig. 4 [ATB: most\nterisks (*) denote assigned areas]\nRight\nre ATB x y z Z-score ATB\n24 \u221270 58 5.50\n8 \u221270 62 5.44\n30% hiP2 54 \u221232 56 4.32\n52 \u221246 \u221216 4.67\n10% BA6 30 0 66 3.93 10% BA6\n30% BA44\n40 \u221264 \u221226 4.73\n14 \u221262 62 4.19\n50% BA2* 28 \u221246 70 3.16 50% BA2*\n30% BA2 44 \u221242 56 3.96\n38 \u221256 \u221234 3.40\n24 \u221242 \u221248 3.35\ning of hand actions: Effects of practice and expertise, NeuroImage (2007),\n9S. Vogt et al. \/ NeuroImage xx (2007) xxx\u2013xxx\nARTICLE IN PRESSDiscussion\nThree main findings were obtained in this study and will be\ndiscussed in turn: First, the results for the imitation of hand actions\nacross practice conditions replicate and extend previous findings in\nseveral ways. Second, the pattern of activations in the DLPFC\nconfirms the hypothesis that in imitation learning the left rostral\nMFG engages in operations of selection and combination of motor\nrepresentations in the MNS (Buccino et al., 2004a). In addition, our\ndata support the proposal by Shallice (2004) that the right MFG is\nprimarily involved in monitoring if a newly configured motor plan\nis implemented and executed in accordance with task goals. Third,\nthe MNS was more strongly involved during the observation of\nnovel actions than of previously practised actions. This finding\nindicates a strong role of the MNS in imitation learning, and thus\ncomplements the work by Calvo-Merino et al. (2005, 2006) and\nCross et al. (2006) which suggested a primary role of the MNS in\nrepresenting previously acquired motor skills.\nImitation of hand actions\nIn order to identify regions with mirror properties, we computed\na conjunction between action observation, motor preparation and\nexecution. This indicated a parieto-premotor network (inferior and\nsuperior parietal lobules as well as ventral and dorsal premotor\nregions) similar to that reported in previous studies (e.g., Gr\u00e8zes et\nal., 2003). The interpretation of the roles of inferior parietal lobule\nand ventral premotor cortex (PMv) as core components of the\nmirror neuron system is straightforward (Buccino et al., 2004a;\nRizzolatti and Craighero, 2004). Both areas most likely code the\nidentity and posture of individual elements in the display as\npotential own actions (e.g., an extended index finger and a flexed\nring finger). During observation, the fingers on the screen are\nmapped onto the observer's own motor repertoire, and these\nelementary representations remain activated through to execution.\nIn their recent meta-analysis of related neuroimaging studies,\nChouinard and Paus (2006) report a focus in left PMv as conjunctTable 3\nMNI coordinates of local maxima in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), given separate\n(np) and practised (pr) chords\nLeft rostral MFG Left caudal MF\nx y z Z-score x y\nEvent 1\nNG\/np \u221240 52 4 4.64 \u221246 38\nNG\/pr \u221248 32\nG\/np \u221238 56 16 3.24 \u221248 34\nG\/pr\nEvent 2\nNG\/np \u221234 52 10 3.91 \u221240 36\nNG\/pr \u221234 52 12 3.31 \u221234 36\nG\/np \u221230 52 16 5.23 \u221234 36\nG\/pr \u221234 52 18 3.40 \u221236 38\nEvent 3\nNG\/np\nNG\/pr \u221230 36\nG\/np \u221238 38\nG\/pr \u221236 40\nPlease cite this article as: Vogt, S., et al., Prefrontal involvement in imitation learn\ndoi:10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2007.07.005between studies on the observation and studies on the execution of\nobject-related actions (\u221258, 6, 28 in Talairach coordinates;\napproximately \u221259, 5, 31 in MNI coordinates) which closely\nmatches that in the present study. Furthermore, it is reassuring that\nthe direct contrasts between events (bottom panel of Fig. 2)\nindicate little change in the regions of the MNS, whereas the SMA,\nprimary sensory-motor areas and areas involved in complex tactile\nexploration exhibit dramatic changes.\nThe bilateral activation in superior frontal gyrus can be\ninterpreted in several ways: According to Buccino et al. (2004a),\nit reflects the involvement of dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) in\npreparing the proprioceptive and motor execution aspects of the\nrequired action. Further, the cluster in the right hemisphere is\ncoextensive with the focus for rostral PMd in the meta-analysis by\nChouinard and Paus (2006), where this area (TAL: 28, 0, 52; MNI:\n28, \u22123, 56) was consistently involved in the selection of motor\nresponses based on spatial or arbitrary cues. Our left cluster,\nhowever, is located more medially and dorsally than their focus for\nleft rostral PMd (TAL: \u221232, \u22122, 50; MNI: \u221232, \u22125, 54). A second\npossibility is that the superior frontal activation reflects oculomotor\nprocessing, given its proximity to the location of the human frontal\neye field (FEF) according to Grosbras et al. (2005) (TAL: \u221230, \u22128,\n50 and 36, \u22128, 48; MNI: \u221230, \u221211, 54 and 36, \u221211, 52). Both\ninterpretations, PMd and FEF, are not mutually exclusive and\nreflect the requirement of the chord task to code the location of\neach effector on the fretboard, that is, for spatially oriented\nbehaviour.\nTaken together, the activations in PMv and PMd likely reflect a\nparallel specification of imitative action, with PMv specifying\nindividual effectors and their posture as relayed via the inferior\nparietal lobule, and PMd specifying spatial positions for each\neffector, likely relayed via the superior parietal lobule and hIP2\n(with the latter as a possible, architectonically defined correlate of\nfunctionally defined area AIP, see Choi et al., 2006; Grefkes et al.,\n2002; Grefkes and Fink, 2005).\nTwo points are noteworthy regarding the observed event-\nspecific activations, firstly the extension of the ventral premotorly for each event, non-guitarists (NG) and guitarists (G) and for non-practised\nG Right caudal MFG\nz Z-score x y z Z-score\n30 4.54 44 44 26 4.03\n34 4.24\n32 4.29 52 34 30 3.21\n26 4.20 34 40 30 4.20\n30 4.06 34 38 32 4.28\n30 5.07 34 40 26 5.91\n30 3.79 34 44 26 4.17\n36 44 30 3.36\n26 3.59 36 42 28 3.81\n26 4.13 40 44 24 4.64\n26 4.07 40 46 18 4.23\ning of hand actions: Effects of practice and expertise, NeuroImage (2007),\nFig. 5.

In a re-\nanalysis of studies on the imitation of simple finger movements,\nMolnar-Szakacs et al. (2005) found dPO involved in imitation and,\nless strongly, in observation, whereas vPO was exclusively\nactivated during imitation. Based on this dissociation, the authors\nproposed a functional segregation within PO, where dPO is a\nclassical mirror neuron area, whereas vPO provides a forward\nmodel of the expected sensory consequences of the action. Our\ndata qualify this hypothesis in several ways. First, we showed that\nthe ventral premotor cortex also exhibits mirror properties, as PMv\nwas found activated in the conjunction analysis as well as in the\nunderlying basic contrasts. These clusters only slightly invaded the\nadjacent dPO. As noted above, this conclusion is also supported by\nthe meta-analysis of Chouinard and Paus (2006). Second, the focus\nin PMv increasingly extended into dPO and vPO during Events 2\nand 3, so that vPO was consistently activated during Event 3\n(cf. Fig. 3). As proposed by Molnar-Szakacs et al. (2005), it\nappears possible that this event-specific activation reflects forward\nmodeling in a network including posterior parietal and likely also\ncerebellar regions. While one would expect forward modeling to be\nprimarily associated with motor execution, we found vPO already\ninvolved when the guitarists observed the non-practised chords\n(G\/np-1). Indeed, forward modeling in advance of execution would\nbe most useful when selecting amongst familiar but not recently\npractised actions.Please cite this article as: Vogt, S., et al., Prefrontal involvement in imitation learn\ndoi:10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2007.07.005The activation focus located in the sensorimotor cortex (M1,\nplus BA2 and OP1) during Event 2 seems to indicate a stronger\n\u2018motor readiness\u2019 of participants than in our first study and is\nconsistent with the previously reported involvement of M1 in\nmotor preparation (Endo et al., 1999; Ikeda et al., 1996;\nKawashima et al., 1994) and motor imagery (Lotze et al., 1999;\nPorro et al., 2000; Schnitzler et al., 1997).\nEffects of practice and expertise on prefrontal activations\nA major aim of the present study was to assess the effects of\npractice on prefrontal activations in imitation learning. To this end,\nparticipants had practised four chords in a single session one day\nbefore the scanning, which showed clear practice effects in the\nbehavioural testing. This most likely reflected the fact that the\npractised chords were recognised and executed as complete units,\nwhereas participants were still engaged in configuring the non-\npractised chords (Hazeltine et al., in press). According to our model\nof imitation learning (Buccino et al., 2004a), the selection and\ncombination of motor elements into novel actions proceeds under\nthe control of the DLPFC. The present data support this hypothesis\nin the following ways. First, during action observation the left rostral\nMFG (most likely area 46) was more strongly involved than in the\nprevious study by Buccino et al. (2004a) (Fig. 3, top left panel),\npossibly as a result of the additional training session and of the\nrelated greater \u2018motor readiness\u2019 of the participants in our current\nstudy. This demonstration of prefrontal involvement during actioning of hand actions: Effects of practice and expertise, NeuroImage (2007),\n11S. Vogt et al. \/ NeuroImage xx (2007) xxx\u2013xxx\nARTICLE IN PRESSobservation is an important extension of our previous results, where\nactivations in the left rostral MFG were largely restricted to the\nsubsequent motor preparatory event, with the inherent ambiguity of\ninterpretation of prefrontal activations in the hold period of delayed\nresponse tasks (Passingham, 1993). Second, area 46 was more\nstrongly activated during action observation and motor preparation\nof the non-practised chords compared to the practised chords, with\nthe latter exhibiting reduced or absent activations. Third, reliable\neffects of chord type were observed on the BOLD signal specifically\nfor the left rostral MFG. These findings render an explanation in\nterms of passive maintenance of sensory or motor representations\nunlikely and support an interpretation of DLPFC function in terms of\nintegrating this information and selecting appropriate behaviour\n(Passingham and Sakai, 2004). Finally, during motor execution, the\nleft prefrontal foci showed no or even reduced BOLD signals\nrelative to baseline, whereas the right caudal MFG showed sustained\nsignal amplitudes in Events 2 and 3. These differential effects are\nwell in line with Shallice's (2004) proposal of a left DLPFC\ndominance in modulating lower level systems (here: the MNS),\nwhereas the right DLPFC is dominant in monitoring operations\n(here: checking whether motor preparation and execution match the\nobserved model).\nHow are these findings to be interpreted in the context of\nprevious work on prefrontal involvement in motor learning? In\ngeneral, the role of the prefrontal cortex in dealing with non-routine\noperations is undisputed (Miller and Cohen, 2001). Furthermore, it\nhas been shown in a variety of cognitive and motor tasks that\nprefrontal activations are most pronounced for novel material and\nsubstantially reduce with practice, often to baseline levels (e.g.,\nPetersen et al.'s, 1998, \u201cscaffolding-storage\u201d framework). In studies\nof non-imitative motor learning, such a redistribution of activations\n(Kelly and Garavan, 2005) has been demonstrated for sequencing\ntasks (Keele et al., 2003), bimanual coordination (Debaere et al.,\n2004) and force field adaptation (Shadmehr and Holcomb, 1997).\nHowever, rather indirect task instructions were typically used in\nthese paradigms (e.g., trial-and-error learning of sequences of\nkeypresses in Jenkins et al., 1994), and prefrontal activations might\ntherefore primarily reflect the cognitive operations of understanding\nthe required task, rather than top-down control of performance per\nse. In contrast, given the high degree of visuomotor compatibility in\nimitation paradigms (Meltzoff and Prinz, 2002), prefrontal engage-\nment might not be expected. Our demonstration of transient left\nprefrontal involvement in imitation learning thus indicates that even\nin tasks allowing for a direct matching of visual and motor\nrepresentations, top-down control of these elementary representa-\ntions is present when learning novel material. Regarding the role of\ndifferent prefrontal areas, further research is required to indicate\nwhether the DLPFC is more generally associated with imitation\ntasks (Iacoboni, 2005), or whether our findings merely reflect the\nspecific requirement of configurational tasks to manipulate and\nmonitor several pieces of information that mid-dorsal prefrontal\nregions have been associated with (Petrides, 1995). To examine\nfurther our interpretation of the right DLPFC activations as\nreflecting monitoring operations (Shallice, 2004), future research\nshould aim to replicate the present pattern of results independent of\nthe effector used (left hand in our study).\nAs described above, expert guitarists showed significantly\nsmaller BOLD signals in prefrontal regions during action observa-\ntion and larger signals during motor preparation. As one would\nexpect, the guitarists most likely tended to exert less supervisory\ncontrol during observation, given that both chord types were familiarPlease cite this article as: Vogt, S., et al., Prefrontal involvement in imitation learn\ndoi:10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2007.07.005to them, and they exerted more control during motor preparation,\nwhich was reflected in the higher scores for imitation quality.\nHowever, compared to the robust practice effects, the group\ndifferences were rather small. In particular, larger group differences\nmight have been expected specifically for the non-practised chords,\nwhich were familiar to the guitarists only. Interestingly, however,\npractice and familiarity with the chords were indeed reflected in the\nhippocampal activations during Event 1, which were present in all\nconditions except when the non-guitarists observed the non-\npractised chords. Nevertheless, also in the quality of imitations,\nboth groups showed equivalent differences between the two chord\ntypes, and in the speed test after the scanning, the guitarists showed\neven stronger performance decrements for the non-practised chords\nthan the non-guitarists. A viable explanation for this pattern of\nresults is that the guitarists had engaged strongly in the practice\nphase and that, as the non-guitarists, they re-engaged strongly when\nconfronted with the non-practised chords. Also, given that the\nguitarists were mainly trained in classical guitar, their spectrum of\nhand postures was extremely wide, and thus familiarity with the\nbasic chords used in the present study was possibly less\nadvantageous as for, e.g., folk guitarists with a typically more\nlimited chord repertoire. Finally, the unusual arm and hand posture\nin which the chords were to be performed may have prevented the\nguitarists from fully benefitting from their expertise.\nEffects of practice and expertise on the mirror neuron system and\nrelated areas\nAs predicted, activations in the MNS were stronger for non-\npractised than for practised chords, in particular during action\nobservation when all posterior parietal and premotor components\nof the MNS exhibited this effect. During the motor preparation and\nexecution events, the posterior parietal areas continued to show\ndifferential activations between chord types.\nThe stronger involvement of the MNS for novel hand actions\napparently contradicts the results of a number of previous studies.\nFirst, Buccino et al. (2004b) demonstrated that only actions that were\npresent in the observer's motor repertoire produced activations in the\nMNS. More recently, Calvo-Merino et al. (2005, 2006) and Cross et\nal. (2006) showed stronger activations in the MNS when dancers\nobserved dancing movements that were part of the individual's\nmotor repertoire, compared to observation of matched, but non-\npractised movements. How can these conflicting results be\nexplained? Whereas participants in our study imitated the chords\nafter observation, participants in Buccino et al.'s (2004b) study\nsimply watched the different actions, participants in Calvo-Merino\net al.'s (2005, 2006) studies were asked to judge \u2018how tiring\u2019 each\nmovement was, and those in the study by Cross et al. (2006) judged\nhow well they could dance each movement. It is plausible that the\ndifferent outcomes between these studies and ours reflect the\ndifferent aims of the observation (see also Gr\u00e8zes et al., 1998).\nDuring observation not followed by imitation, observers tend to\n\u2018resonate\u2019more strongly with actions already embodied in their own\nmotor repertoire. In contrast, during observation in order to imitate,\nnovel actions tend to induce stronger activations in the MNS than\nfamiliar actions. This likely results from a stronger modulatory input\nfrom prefrontal areas, which were not found activated in the above\naction observation studies. Accordingly, one should expect that a\npure chord observation condition reduces activations in the MNS\nrelative to an imitation condition. This was indeed demonstrated by\nBuccino et al. (2004a) for novel chords. Furthermore, we woulding of hand actions: Effects of practice and expertise, NeuroImage (2007),\n12 S. Vogt et al. \/ NeuroImage xx (2007) xxx\u2013xxx\nARTICLE IN PRESSpredict that, when dancers were asked to actually imitate movements\nafter the scanning, their MNS (and DLPFC) would be more strongly\ninvolved when observing non-familiar movements than familiar\nones.\nWhereas the moderate practice given in the present study\nindeed reduced prefrontal activations, it did not produce clear-cut\nshifts of activations to other cortical regions, in the sense of a\ngenuine reorganisation (Kelly and Garavan, 2005). Although\nstronger activations for practised vs. non-practised chords were\nobserved in a number of cortical areas, none of these differential\nactivations corresponded to positive activations in the basic\ncontrasts. Therefore, these findings must be treated with caution.\nA minimalist explanation would be that both elementary finger\npostures and learned configurations of these postures (i.e.,\ncomplete chords) are represented in the MNS. Hence, large-scale\nshifts of activations to areas other than the MNS would not be\nexpected as a result of practice. A likely exception might be an\nadditional coding of highly practised actions in superior temporal\nregions (e.g., Calvo-Merino et al., 2005), which presumably\nrequires longer practice periods than employed in the present study.\nNevertheless, the stronger activation for practised chords in the left\nangular gyrus and the right posterior middle temporal gyrus in our\nstudy might be an early indication of such an experience-dependent\nplasticity of higher order visual areas.\nFinally, we also observed some expertise effects in areas other\nthan the prefrontal cortex. During action observation, the guitarists\nshowed stronger activations in the right precentral gyrus, pre-\nsumably reflecting their increased level of motor readiness, while the\nnon-guitarists showed stronger activations in the right superior\nparietal lobule, presumably reflecting their emphasis on abstract\nvisuospatial and\/or kinesthetic analysis. During motor preparation\nand execution, a different sector of the precentral gyrus was more\nstrongly activated in the guitarists, as well as the left inferior parietal\nlobule. The latter likely reflected a more elaborate representation of\nthe chord postures in this mirror neuron area. During motor\nexecution, the guitarists also exhibited a stronger activation in the\nparietal operculum (\u2018OP 4\u2019, Eickhoff et al., 2006a,b), likely\nreflecting a more elaborate analysis of multimodal somatosensory\ninput. Similarly as the group differences in prefrontal regions, also\nthe above group effects were less pronounced than the practice\neffects in the present study; nevertheless, they fit well into the\npresent explanatory framework.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that the human MNS can\nbe involved in the early stages of imitation learning. This finding is\nat variance with earlier views that suggested that this involvement\nrequires motor experience with the observed action. When\nsubsequent imitation is required, observed unfamiliar actions are\ndecomposed into familiar elements via motor resonance in the\nMNS (Buccino et al., 2004a). The combination of these elements\ninto a novel configural action most likely proceeds under the\nsupervisory control of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.Acknowledgments\nWe would like to thank B.
