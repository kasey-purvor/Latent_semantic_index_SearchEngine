During the last decade the increasing pace of developments in industry and commerce, stimulated by technology, have resulted in significant changes in management and working practices. There is a realization that prosperity and economic competitiveness require an educated and trained workforce, and this is influencing education, both in its content and methods, with a widening access under a vision of lifelong learning. Personal development of students in skills of communication, study methods, creativity, problem-solving and collaborative methods of learning, are becoming more prominent, and institutions are having to provide greater support for staff and students to achieve these wider objectives. It is here that coaching and mentoring are important, and this publication with its emphasis &quot;on practical methods is both useful and timely. The orientation of the book is towards the workplace and community centres, but there is much that is relevant to educational institutions. With its direct approach and economical style, clear sectioning, summary points, checklists and charts, this book provides a useful and practical introduction to mentoring and coaching that is directed to improving learning. The first chapter sets out the development of coaching\/mentoring that moved it from a marginal activity to a recognized component of training. Although the links to sports coaching, workplace counselling, and professional training, are sketchy in their analyses within a relatively short chapter, they do illustrate the complexities in defining and circumscribing coaching\/mentoring. A recurring comment is that these techniques are multi-faceted and have to adjust to differing institutional and cultural 78 environments. Both coaching and mentoring are directed at individual group members; coaching typically addresses performance goals, whereas mentoring takes a wider view of personal development and growth. The chapter ends with a useful set of tables distinguishing their purposes and orientations. The second chapter, noting the global advances in information technology, sets out the concept of a learning organization in which coaching and mentoring are key components. The psychology on learning is selective and superficial, making few references to the research literature, but the authors make distinctions between the learning experience and reflection. These are loosely linked, without critical discussion, to learning styles and to development as 'the learning of new knowledge, understanding, skills and behaviours'. The authors' style is prescriptive but makes useful points on the perceptions and implementation of learning opportunities, and the motivation that is needed to exploit them. Having outlined this view of the learning\/ development process the next three chapters discuss the main theme of the book - that the aim of coaching\/mentoring is 'helping people learn how to learn'. Coaching is conceived as a process of analysis, agreeing a personal development plan with the learner, then implementing and evaluating that plan. Under this framework interesting comments are made on coaching style, that is, 'the manner in which coaching is performed' and which has to adapt to the experience and performance of the learner. Examples are taken from the workplace with a useful discussion on coaching inexperienced learners using a 'practice spiral' and a 'skills framework' technique. These comments reflect the experience of the authors and are practically orientated. For the more experienced learners, the GROW technique (Establish Goals, Examine Reality, Consider Options, and Confirm the Will to Act) is outlined and the chapter ends with a selfassessment exercise to 'establish your current levels of competence as a coach'. In discussing mentoring, the authors point out that this one-to-one activity is employed in many different contexts, all with their varied demands and constraints. In consequence, an unambiguous definition of the mentoring process is hard to achieve, but four key stages are discussed which illustrate the principal features of mentoring, namely confirming the personal developmentAlt-J Volume 9 Number 3 plan, encouraging self-management of learning, providing support and assisting in the evaluation of success. These stages are discussed using four examples to show the wide variations that exist in the theory and practice of mentoring. These examples are taken from business, institutes, social services and manufacturing, but all highlight the importance of preparation and training for mentors, agreeing a format for meetings, monitoring progress and evaluation. Again the chapter ends with a self-assessment exercise. The third chapter in this section of the book addresses community mentoring. Much practical illustration and discussion are provided in contexts that can require mentors to be guidance providers, pseudo-parents, caseworkers, as well as learning facilitators. The argument moves to the professional development of what are termed 'coach-mentors', notes recent government initiatives, but points to the care which will have to be exercised in designing training schemes which need to adapt to varying contexts. Overall the authors provide a perceptive discussion of the differing requirements of community mentors and the need for empathy, and establishing rapport and a sense of trust with the person who is being mentored. In summary, readers wishing to know more of coaching\/mentoring will find interesting topics for discussion, practical work schemes and checklists, and much sensible advice - all written in a direct and pointed style.","cites":null},{"id":192067,"title":"Introduction to Action Research: Social Research for Social Change, Thousand Oaks,","authors":[],"date":"1998","doi":"10.1075\/cat.4.3.06van","raw":"Greenwood, D. and Levin, M.

Race, 500 Tips on Group Learning, London:\nKogan Page, 2000. ISBN: 0-7494-2884-8. Soft-\nback, vii + 135 pages, \u00a315.99.\nThis is another in the long list of '500 Tips'\nseries, published by Kogan Page. Phil Race, the\nauthor, is a well-known name in learning and\nteaching and has published extensively. The\npresentation of advice in this way is clearly a\nwell-tested formula and, judging by the copies\nfrom the series in my own institution's library,\nthese are frequently borrowed books, but I\nwonder whether this format is now a little over-\nused? Advice from a guru can be very valuable,\nbut in an era of evidence-based practice it is even\nbetter if the advice is backed up with references\nto facilitate the reader's further research in the\narea. Unfortunately in this book references are\nfew and far between. There is a short list of\nsuggested further reading but, for example, in\nthe section on being a group member, where the\nwork of Belbin is referred to, this is not\nreferenced and Belbin does not appear in the\nsubsequent reading list.\nThere are six chapters in the book. Each chapter\nstarts with a general introduction and then gives\na list of tips together with an explanation for\neach one.\nThe first three chapters, 'Learning with others',\n'Getting groups going', and 'Particular group\nlearning contexts', give very general advice\ncovering what group work means, how to\nprepare learners for group work and different\nsorts of groups. Section 19 in Chapter 3 purports\nto cover tutorials for adult distance learners, but\nonly suggestions for tutorials when such distance\nlearners attend the institution are given.\nStrategies for holding successful virtual tutorials,\nsuch as computer conferences or Web-based chat\nrooms, which are increasingly used in many\nprogrammes and courses, are not mentioned.\nAlthough this might have been beyond the scope\nof this book, an acknowledgement of this sort of\ndevelopment, with indications for further\nreading could have been helpful. On the whole\nthe tips given in the first three chapters are\nentirely common sense - who could argue with,\nfor example, in the section entitled 'group\nlearning means learning by doing' that 'listening\nto each other has a lot to do with effective\ngroup learning'? The majority of tips are at\nthis general level and not much new informa-\ntion is presented. The blurb on the outside\nback cover of the book states: 'Packed with\nexpert advice guidance and support, this\ninspirational book will provide educators and\ntrainers with the tools needed to move from\ninstruction to facilitation.' I am sorry to say that\nI did not find much inspiration in these three\nchapters.\nChapter 4 explores exercises and processes for\ngroups and finishes by-giving a case study. Here\nthe tips were more focused and the case study\none of the most useful parts of the whole book.\nThe author presents a case study he has used\nwhen running training workshops on chemical\nhazards. This might sound a somewhat esoteric\ntopic, but the format of the workshop could\n75\nReviews\neasily be translated to good effect into many\nother topic areas.\nChapter 5 considers groups behaving badly and\ngives tips for dealing with, among others,\ndisruptive behaviour, the know-all, the domin-\nator, the non-contributor and the group member\nwho does not listen. There is also consideration\nof different behaviours of the group facilitator\nthat can damage group work and this is also a\nrelevant and helpful section. It is probably\nsalutary for most of us to consider the sections\non facilitators who talk too much and intimidate\nlearners and those who favour clones of\nthemselves! A section on institutional factors\nthat can damage group work, including lack of\nprovision of suitable spaces and timetable\nsystems that militate against group learning will\nbe familiar to most readers, I suspect. Many of\nus might well have tried solutions such as 'use\ncoffee bars' or 'take the group to the nearest pub'\nand had an interesting time, but found it harder\nto fulfil our anticipated outcomes for those\nparticular group sessions! The suggestion to do a\nroom usage audit to identify rooms which are\nregularly underused might evoke an ironic 'huh'\n- who has time for that sort of task in our\nincreasingly loaded timetables!\nChapter 6 is devoted to how group learning\nmight be assessed. There are some helpful\nsuggestions here that cover situations where not\nall members of a group might have contributed\nequally to a group assessment. Advantages and\ndisadvantages for each method are given which\nmakes this a very useful chapter.\nThe way in which the 500 tips are presented is\nsomewhat confusing; it took me some time to\nwork out that the sections in each chapter are\nnumbered sequentially and cumulatively, but the\nactual tips in each section always start from one.\nThis would make it harder to direct someone to\na particularly useful tip. At the risk of seeming\nrather a sad person, I have to confess that I\nattempted to count the total number of tips\npresented - and could find only 473 - were we\nshort-changed here?\nOverall I am not sure that this topic area lends\nitself so readily to the '500 Tips' approach.\nIssues around group and collaborative learning\nmerit a deeper and more considered\npresentation. A format that uses numbered\nstatements to present suggestions and advice\nprecludes the introduction of critical discussion\nand reasoning.\n76\nWho is the book for? If it is aimed at trainee\nteachers or new entrants to higher education,\nthen I am sure they will find much to help them.\nHowever, for the more experienced facilitators I\ndo not think they will find this book offers very\nmuch that they do not already know.\nGillian Jordan\nUniversity of Greenwich\nDavid Kember, Action Learning and Action\nResearch: Improving the Quality of Teaching and\nLearning, London: Kogan Page, 2000. ISBN: 0-\n7494-3113-X. Softback, ix + 243 pages, \u00a319.99.\nSeveral large-scale programmes to enhance the\nquality of teaching and learning in higher\neducation have featured within the UK, for\nexample TLTP and FDTL. This book describes\na similar programme, the Action Learning\nProject (ALP), which took place in Hong Kong\nbetween 1994 and 1998 with funding from the\nHong Kong University Grants Commission.\nFrom its inception, the project was set within a\nframework of using action learning and action\nresearch to demonstrate that, as a quality\nassurance mechanism, this approach could be\nenergizing for those involved and could lead to\nenhanced quality in teaching and learning in a\ncost-effective manner. The main aim of the book\nis to contribute to the quality assurance and\nenhancement literature rather than the research\nmethodology literature, so it is not for those\nlooking for a detailed, theoretical review of\naction research methodology. It will be of\ninterest to those responsible for introducing or\nmanaging institution-wide teaching and learning\nschemes, and who are looking for an effective\nway of engaging participants and evaluating the\noutcomes within a research framework.\nThe book is divided into five sections. Part A\nsets the work within a framework of approaches\nto quality assurance; Part B describes the\nprojects and participants; Part C describes the\nexperiences of the participants, including their\nperceptions of the action research framework;\nPart D describes the support provided for the\nprojects; and Part E provides concluding\nremarks on the effectiveness of the action\nresearch approach. The structure of the book\nreflects the cyclical stages of the action research\napproach. It also contains three appendices, a\nreference list and an index.\nIn Part A, the first three chapters set out the\nframework within which action research may be\nconsidered as a scheme for assuring the quality of\nA\/t-J Volume 9 Number 3\nteaching and learning. In Chapter 1 there is an\nintroduction to higher education quality schemes\nin general. A distinction is made between quality\nassurance and quality enhancement schemes and\nthese are mapped against three research\nparadigms, positivist, interpretive and critical\nepistcmologies. The case is made for locating the\nproject-based method of quality enhancement\nwithin the critical paradigm, which includes\naction research. Chapter 2 continues to explore\nthe rationale for considering quality enhancement\nschemes within an action research and action\nlearning framework. The three key characteristics\nof action research are defined through a reference\nfrom Carr and Kemmis. It is concerned with\nimproving social practice, there is a systematic,\ncyclical process of enquiry, and it is participative.\nAction research is then compared with action\nlearning, drawing on a definition from McGill\nand Beaty for the latter. Action learning, rather\nthan action research, was the preferred term for\nthe project name because the funding body\nspecifically excluded research. The chapter ends\npragmatically by suggesting that the two terms\nwill be used interchangeably throughout the rest\nof the book. Chapter 3 provides more detail\nabout methods of observation and evaluation\nthat can be used by project teams to monitor and\nreport on their work. Overall, the treatment of so\nmany complex research concepts in this short\nsection is inevitably generalized but there are\nreferences to other more specific sources.\nPart B contains Chapters 4 to 7 and through\ndescribing the context of the ALP, it addresses\nthe steps necessary for implementing and\nmanaging a large project which itself is\ncomposed of fifty smaller sub-projects, spread\nacross seven universities. Chapter 4 discusses the\nways in which academics can be persuaded to\nparticipate in projects, and Chapter 5 describes\nthe project management structure that had to\ninvolve all seven universities. Chapter 6 gives an\nindication of the range of projects funded and\nChapter 7 outlines the methods used to\ndisseminate the project outcomes, including a\nWeb site, http:llalp.polyu.edu.hk.\nIn parts C and D, the author's associates\ncontribute to Chapters 8 to 15 and describe the\nperceptions and experiences of the participants.\nThey draw on material from their own\nevaluation of the project. It is in these two parts\nof the book that the key characteristics of action\nresearch and action learning are most clearly\nillustrated in practice. Chapter 8 focuses on the\nevaluation design and methods of data\ncollection. Chapter 9 considers the reasons why\nparticipants became involved in the project, the\nmain one being a desire to improve the quality of\ntheir teaching and their students' learning.\nChapter 10 focuses on the importance of\neffective teamwork in the projects and highlights\nthe collaborative nature of action research.\nChapter 11 describes how the project teams\nadopted the action research cycle. Chapter 12\nreports the participants' views on the outcomes\nof their projects.\nIn part D, Chapters 13 to 15 return to the\norganization and management of the project and\nfocus on the various ways in which support was\nprovided to the project teams. This involved a\nsmall co-ordinating team of facilitators, each of\nwhom supported ten to twelve projects. They\naimed to do this in conjunction with the internal\neducational development units of the univers-\nities. The nature of the support varied, but much\nof it centred on support for research design,\nmethodology, evaluation techniques and writing\nup research. The facilitators found themselves to\nbe most comfortable in the role of 'critical friend'\nto the project teams and Chapter 14 describes in\nsome detail the ways in which this role developed.\nIn the final two chapters in part E, the author\nreturns to the issue of quality assurance as he\nreflects on the overall outcomes of the ALP.\nChapter 16 reflects on the high cost of ensuring\nquality in higher education and suggests that\npromoting quality through action learning\nprojects is cost-effective. Chapter 17 summarizes\nthe overall outcomes of the project and\nconcludes that action learning is an effective\nmethod of quality enhancement.\nIn conclusion, those looking for an in-depth\nunderstanding of the philosophy and methodo-\nlogy of action research should consult other\nsources, for example, Greenwood and Levin\n(1998), and the quality of the book would have\nbeen increased if clear distinctions had been\nmaintained throughout between action research\nand action learning, rather than using them\ninterchangeably. Nevertheless, the book is an\neasy read, and should be of interest to those\ninvolved in similar projects, both at the\ninstitutional as well as the national level. The\nframeworks and methods used will also be useful\nfor individuals who wish to use action research\nand action learning as a framework for\nevaluating their own teaching activities.\nJanet Hanson\nBournemouth University\n77\nReviews\nReferences\nCarr, W. and Kemmis, S.

Ryan, B. Scott, H. Freeman and D. Patel, The\nVirtual University - The Internet and Resource-\nbased Learning, London: Kogan Page, 2000.\nISBN: 0-7494-2508-3. Softback, xiii + 204 pages,\n\u00a319.99.\nIn recent years there has been much talk about\n'virtual organizations'; that is, the ability to\ncreate an entity that does not physically exist -\nother than in cyberspace and in people's minds.\nVirtual offices and virtual businesses, for\nexample, have 'existed' for some considerable\ntime. Now we are seeing the application of the\n'vi duality' paradigm within educational\norganizations. We are therefore now hearing\nmuch talk about virtual classrooms, virtual com-\nmunities of learners, virtual learning environ-\nments and virtual university systems. This book\ndeals with the use of the Internet and Resource-\nBased Learning (RBL) in order to realize the\nelectronic delivery of courses. Naturally, the\nultimate aim of this could be the realization of a\nvirtual university facility.\nThe material contained within the book is\norganized into an introduction, ten 'semi-\nindependent' chapters, a reference section (con-\ntaining the bibliographic details for both the\nconventional references and the on-line\ncitations) and a glossary. I describe the book's\nchapters as 'semi-independent' since the authors\nclaim that each chapter could be read (in a\nstand-alone fashion) independently of any of\nthe others. There is a Web site to accompany the\nbook. This resides at http:llwestworld.dmu.ac.ukf\nvu-rbl and 'contains links to the Web pages\nmentioned in the book - as well as updates and\nnew links'. This site is quite nicely designed -\nechoing the colour scheme and design of the\nbook's front cover. Unfortunately, none of the\nWeb pages contain any dates and so it is not\npossible to see when, if at all, the site has been\nupdated.\nThe opening chapter of the book 'sets the scene'\nfor the nine chapters that follow. It does this by\ndescribing many of the current developments\nthat are taking place in higher education (HE)\nand the impact that the Internet and the Web are\nhaving. The primary focus of the chapter is on\ndevelopments that are taking place in the United\nKingdom, although some examples from other\ncountries (such as America and Australia) are\nalso included. A fundamental premiss made by\nthe authors (p. 2) is that 'RBL can only be done\nwel l . . . if supported by appropriate models of\nlearning and teaching and principles of course\ndesign'. This requirement is 'followed up' in\nChapter 2, which deals with the various theories\nof teaching and learning that are 'particularly\nrelevant for understanding how to do RBL well'\n(p. 5). Following the somewhat brief descriptions\nof learning theories (such as constructivism and\nconversationalism), types of learner and\napproaches to learning, the chapter concludes by\npresenting an outline framework for course\ndesign.\nThe real 'meat' of the book starts in Chapters 3,\n4 and 5. The first of these examines the nature of\nthe Internet and focuses on a number of issues\nrelevant to the use of this medium for teaching\nand learning. Although some interesting con-\ncepts and examples are described, from a\ntechnical perspective the treatment presented in\nthis chapter (and some of the ones that follow) is\nvery superficial - but then, I suppose the book is\n79\nReviews\nnot really intended for 'technocrats'. Chapter 4\nbuilds on the material that was presented in\nChapters 2 and 3; it deals with using the Internet\nand the Web for course development and\ndelivery. There are three main themes in this\nchapter, developing an online course (for which\nthe authors advocate a team approach); tools for\nplanning structuring and development; and\ndelivery issues. As this chapter is quite a short\none, the three topics (particularly, the last one)\nare only treated in a superficial way. Chapter 5\ncontinues the trilogy with a discussion of\n'Resources on the World Wide Web'. The\ndiscourse in this chapter covers a variety of\ndifferent topics such as digital\/on-line libraries,\nelectronic publishing, discussion groups, news-\ngroups, museums and on-line laboratories. There\nis a 'page or two' on evaluation but the treatment\ngiven lacks depth and rigour. Unfortunately,\ndespite the many different types of resource that\nare described, very little is said in this chapter\nabout the pedagogic aspects of using these\nresources to support teaching and learning.\nChapters 6 and 7 are probably two of the most\ninteresting ones in the book. They deal with\ncomputer-mediated communication (CMC) for\ncollaborative learning and computer-assisted\nassessment, respectively. The CMC chapter\ncovers a wide range of techniques, such as real-\ntime chat, MUDs and MOOs, email, discussion\nlists, newsgroups (again!) and conferencing.\nSeveral types of conferencing technology are\ndiscussed. The discussion starts off with com-\nputer conferencing (using SoftArc's FirstClass\nsystem as an example) and then goes on to\nconsider a number of audio, video and multi-\nmedia conferencing systems. The chapter on\nassessment covers a wide range of techniques to\nfacilitate both the automated and the semi-\nautomated measurement of students' skills,\nknowledge and on-task performances. Both\nformative and summative approaches to assess-\nment are considered.\nIn many ways, the 'climax' of the book comes in\nChapter 8. This is entitled 'Integrated Systems'.\nThe overall theme of this chapter is the\nintegration of electronic resources with a view to\ncreating virtual learning environments. The three\nmain topics that are addressed are: integrated\ncourse delivery systems (such as Top Class and\nWebCT); international standards to facilitate the\nexchange and integration of teaching and\nlearning resources; and the integration and re-\nuse of 'educational objects'. On the 'standards'\ntheme, one of the interesting pieces of work\n80\ndescribed in this chapter is the Instructional\nManagement Systems project. This uses meta-\ndata techniques in order to realize the exchange\nand inter-operability of pedagogic resources.\nSome mention is also made of the European\nCommunity's Ariadne project - which is also\nconcerned with the reuse (and creation) of\ncomputer-based teaching and learning materials.\nThe final two chapters in the book each deal\nwith various aspects of 'change'. In Chapter 9,\nthe authors discuss 'Changing Cultures in HE'.\nEssentially, this chapter considers how con-\nventional HE organizations (and their staff) may\nneed to adapt in order to accommodate ongoing\ndevelopments in RBL and the competition that\nthey might face from 'real' virtual universities\noperating in a global, world-wide context.\nChapter 10, similarly, looks at 'What's Around\nthe Corner?'. Two potentially important issues\nthat the authors identify include technological\ndevelopments and the role of HE organizations\nin the information age in which we now exist.\nMy own view is that no matter how much we\nautomate our educational systems through the\nuse of RBL, we will still need people (even\nthough they may be virtual ones!).\nI waited a long time to get a copy of this book to\nreview. Having now read the book from cover to\ncover, I am disappointed that it did not live up to\nmy expectations. I say this for two reasons. First,\nit does not really contain a great deal of\ninformation about virtual universities - despite\nits title. Second, I have the impression that the\nbook was put together in a bit of a hurry. There\nare quite a few careless mistakes embedded\nwithin it and one or two factual errors too.\nNevertheless, despite these shortcomings, many\npeople will undoubtedly find this book a useful\nsource of information. However, those who\nalready have some experience in RBL will\nprobably find that it lacks depth in most of the\nareas that it attempts to cover. According to the\nauthors (p. 3), the book is intended 'chiefly for\nteaching staff... who wish to be informed about\nthe changes happening around them and to\nreflect on their implications critically and\ndeeply'. Bearing this in mind, the authors have\ndone a fairly reasonable job in bringing together\nthe diverse information 'sources that are\ncontained within it.\nPhilip Barker\nUniversity of Teesside\n"}
