Introduction\nAnalogue simulation provides a method of solving complicated dynamical equations. One\nbuilds an electronic model of the system under study and then investigates its behaviour,\nusually under the influence of external forces of some kind, using a digital data processor\nto analyse the response. This approach has been found especially useful in relation to\nstochastic problems, i.e. those where the system of interest is subject to random fluctuations\n(noise), either of external or internal origin. Contrary to a still widespread misapprehension,\nanalogue simulation does not require large or costly apparatus: an \u2018analogue computer\u2019 as\nsuch is no longer needed. Nor is the technique difficult to implement. In this review, we\nexplain the basis of the method and describe how different variants have been used to address\nsome selected problems in (mostly) stochastic nonlinear dynamics. First, however, we\ndiscuss in more detail why analogue modelling techniques are valuable, and their advantages\nand disadvantages as compared to more commonly used digital methods (Mannella 1997).\nA major advantage of analogue simulation is that it readily enables large volumes of\na system\u2019s parameter space to be surveyed quickly for interesting phenomena, often by\nturning knobs to adjust the relevant parameters while examining the results on a visual\ndisplay; the equivalent procedure with a digital system is often slower and more ponderous.\nUsually analogue simulations are used to test theoretical predictions. However, there are\nmany examples of new physical phenomena and ideas first discovered through analogue\nsimulations. When noise is added to a strongly nonlinear system, for example, it may\nimprove not only the transmission of signals through the system, but also the signal-to-\nnoise ratio measured at the output (Fauve and Heslot 1983)\u2014an observation that in a large\npart was responsible for the outburst of work on stochastic resonance (see section 4 later).\nOther examples include the idea for the Josephson voltage standard (Kautz 1988, 1996), and\nthe observations of skewing in the stochastic phase portraits of bistable systems driven by\ncoloured noise (Moss and McClintock 1985, Moss et al 1986), modulation-induced negative\ndifferential resistance (Dow et al 1987) and noise-induced spectral narrowing (Dykman et\nal 1990a, b). In each of these cases, the phenomenon had not been predicted theoretically,\nwas not anticipated prior to the experiments and appeared unexpectedly in the analogue\nmodel.\nIn a sense, analogue simulations lie in between real experiments and digital simulations,\nand combine certain characteristic features of each. In both forms of simulation one\ninvestigates model systems. However, the techniques for data acquisition and processing\nused in analogue simulation are often exactly the same as those used in the corresponding\nexperiments on real physical systems. This feature can sometimes be extremely useful,\nfor example in that it enables the acquisition=analysis software to be developed, tested\nand implemented in studies of an analogue model prior to implementing it in the more\ncomplicated environment of a real experiment. Noise-enhanced heterodyning in a fluctuating\nnonlinear optical element, for example, was first simulated in an idealized electronic model\n(Dykman et al 1994a) prior to performing the nonlinear optical experiment itself (Dykman\net al 1995a, b).\nThere is a long-standing and close relationship between studies of fluctuating nonlinear\nsystems and experiments on electrical circuits. The connections were studied in\nradioengineering over several decades, a typical example being the work on fluctuations\nin the Thompson generator (Rytov 1956a, b). In fact, it was experiments of this kind\non electronic circuits that were largely responsible for stimulating the development of the\ntheory of random processes as a whole, yielding a variety of important results some of which\nare now being used in quantum electronics. The relationships between electrical circuits\n4and the properties of Langevin and Fokker\u2013Planck equations were discussed by Landauer\n(1962) and Stratonovich (1963, 1967). In analogue experiments, the static properties of\nthe electronic system are known (or are assumed to be known), and the problem is to\ninvestigate how it responds to random or periodic forcings. An example of the revealing\nrole of such simulations can be seen from the analysis (Smythe et al 1983a, McClintock\nand Moss 1985, Moss et al 1985b) of the Ito\u2013Stratonovich dilemma (Van Kampen 1990). It\nconcerns the description of how a system responds to white noise. Any naturally occurring\nnoise necessarily has a finite correlation time. This is true for the noise used in analogue\nsimulations. Noise in Langevin equations can be considered effectively white in the limit\nwhere its correlation time is very small compared to the relaxation times of the system, which\ncorresponds to the Stratonovich prescription. The physical relevance of this prescription\nwas clearly demonstrated in the analogue simulations. The authors concluded that the\nalternative Ito prescription, much used by theorists at that time, was inapplicable to real\nphysical systems except perhaps in special cases (e.g. equations with delay). In contrast,\nwhen trying to implement similar studies on a digital computer, with the values of the\nnoise being uncorrelated at different discretized instants of time, it was quickly realized that\nany attempt to resolve the dilemma would be fruitless\u2014because it would be necessary for\nthe programmer to choose either the Ito or Stratonovich stochastic calculus in writing the\nsimulation code, thus pre-selecting the answer.\nIn contrast to digital simulations, truncation errors do not accumulate in analogue\nsimulations. Analogue simulations are therefore especially valuable for use, for example,\nwith fast oscillating systems where the integration time (the time over which data are\naccumulated and perhaps ensemble-averaged) substantially exceeds the vibration period,\nas in problems involving quasimonochromatic noise (Dykman et al 1991b, 1993e, and\nsection 6 later). Although digital techniques can always in principle be made more accurate\nthan analogue methods, which typically achieve 2\u20133% accuracy, the relative simplicity\nof analogue simulations and their high speed represent significant advantages, particularly\nwhere qualitative results have to be established\u2014as was the case for the ring-laser gyroscope\nequation (Vogel et al 1987a), for example, where it was found that analogue results of\nsatisfactory statistical quality could be acquired in a matter of 15\u201330 min, whereas numerical\nsolution of the Fokker\u2013Planck equation took hours of Cray time.\nFinally, experience suggests that digital and analogue methods should be regarded as\ncomplementary techniques for the study of stochastic nonlinear problems. Each has its\nown advantages and disadvantages; which of these is emphasized or de-emphasized will\ndepend on the nature of the system being investigated. As in any experimental study, it is\npossible to make mistakes and generate artifacts using either form of simulation. For really\ncomplicated problems it is therefore desirable to use both techniques if possible, with one\nacting as a check on the other, to eliminate mistakes or hidden flaws in the algorithm used\nfor the digital simulation, or misconnections and experimental uncertainties in the analogue\ncircuit.\nIn what follows, although we will concentrate mostly on analogue experimental\ninvestigations by the Lancaster group, we would emphasize that the technique has been,\nand continues to be, used successfully in many other laboratories. For example, electronic\nmodels have been employed extensively over many years for studies of deterministic\nphenomena such as heart rate variability (Van der Pol and Van der Mark 1928), chaos\n(Holmes 1979, Linsay 1981, Testa et al 1982, Jeffries and P\u2019erez 1982, Yeh and Kao 1982,\nD\u2019Humieres et al 1982, Robinson 1990, King and Gaito 1992, Gomes and King 1992, Heagy\net al 1994), phenomena near period-doubling bifurcations (Jeffries and Wiesenfeld 1985,\nBryant and Wiesenfeld 1986, Vohra and Bucholtz 1993, Vohra et al 1994), and the three-\n    5\nphoton Josephson junction parametric amplifier (Bryant et al 1987). Modelling techniques\nfor noise-driven systems were developed by a number of scientists and mathematicians\nincluding, particularly, Morton and Corrsin (1969). The first applications of the technique\nin its contemporary form were probably those reported by Sancho et al (1982), Arecchi et\nal (1982), Fauve and Heslot (1983) and Smythe et al (1983a, b). Subsequently, stochastic\nanalogue modelling has been used by numerous research groups including, for example,\nMitschke et al (1985), Fronzoni et al (1985), Gammaitoni et al (1989), Anishchenko et al\n(1993) and Carroll and Pecora (1993).\nThe particular topics chosen as examples for discussion are intended to be representative.\nWe point out, however, that we have successfully applied the analogue approach to the study\nof many other interesting stochastic nonlinear problems, in addition to those mentioned,\nincluding: noise-induced phase transitions (Smythe et al 1983a), stochastic postponements\nof critical onsets (Robinson et al 1985); noise-induced changes in the relaxation times of\nbistable systems driven by both white (Sancho et al 1985) and coloured (Casademunt et al\n1987) parametric (i.e. multiplicative) noise; bistability driven by coloured noise (Hanggi et\nal 1985, Fronzoni et al 1986); noise-induced postponements of bifurcations in a ring laser\nmodel (Mannella et al 1987a, c) and in the Brusselator (Fronzoni et al 1987a); the effect of\nnoise on a Hopf bifurcation (Fronzoni et al 1987b); fluctuation spectra of the double-well\nDuffing oscillator (Mannella et al 1987b, Dykman et al 1988); Fokker\u2013Planck descriptions\nof coloured noise-driven processes (Grigolini et al 1988); relaxation of fluctuations in the\nsteady state of the Stratonovich model (Mannella et al 1988); the effect of noise on the\nFre\u00b4edericksz transition (Stocks et al 1989b); quantum phenomena, via the Ricatti equation\n(Stocks et al 1989a, 1993a); relaxation near a predicted noise-induced transition, falsifying\n(Jackson et al 1989) an earlier theory and leading to a deeper understanding encompassing\ncoloured noise (Mannella et al 1990); supernarrow spectral peaks near a kinetic phase\ntransition (Dykman et al 1990e); velocity spectra for Brownian motion driven by coloured\nnoise in a periodic potential (Igarashi et al 1992); and noise-induced chaos in the Lorenz\nmodel (Fedchenia et al 1992). Earlier reviews of the application of analogue techniques to\nproblems in stochastic nonlinear dynamics include those by Fronzoni (1989), McClintock\nand Moss (1989) and Mannella and McClintock (1990).\nWe start, in section 2, by describing the basis of the technique, with the intention of\nproviding sufficient detail to enable other scientists to apply it in practice. In sections 3\u20137 we\ndiscuss the use of analogue simulation to illuminate the understanding of several physical\nphenomena selected, in part, to demonstrate the ease with which the technique may be\napplied to a wide diversity of challenging problems. Finally, in section 8, we summarize\nthe present status of the work and offer some speculative comments about future directions.\n2. Technical details\nThe aim is to build an electronic model of the system to be investigated, and then to\nstudy its properties, usually while being driven by randon fluctuations (noise) and\/or other\nexternal forces. In this section, we sketch the basic principles of circuit design, discuss\nnoise generators and outline the steps to be taken in analysing the signal(s) coming from\nthe circuit model.\n2.1. Circuit design\nThe work-horse of modern analogue circuit design is the operational amplifier. For present\npurposes, it enables most of the arithmetic operations needed to model the equations of\n6interest to be effected in a very convenient and economical fashion. An excellent, detailed,\naccount of the use of operational amplifiers and other integrated circuits (ICs) will be found\nin the book by Peyton and Walsh (1993). Here, just for completeness, we summarize very\nbriefly the simple circuit configurations that seem to be used most frequently in modelling\noperations.\n\u000f Addition. Voltages may be added using the general arrangement sketched in figure 1(a).\nThis example is for three input voltages V1, V2 and V3 but, in principle, any number may\nbe used; note that the output is inverted\nVout D \u2212\n\u0012\nRF\nR1\nV1 C RF\nR2\nV2 C RF\nR3\nV3\n\u0013\n: (1)\nNon-inverting addition is also easy to effect (Peyton and Walsh 1993), through use of the\npositive input point, but it is somewhat less flexible in practice; adjustment of the sign is\nin any case easy when analogue multipliers (see later) are in use.\n\u000f Subtraction. Two voltages V1 and V2 can readily be subtracted by use of the\narrangement in figure 1(b), for which\nVout D\n\u0012\nR2\nR1\n\u0013\n.V1 \u2212 V2\/: (2)\n\u000f Multiplication or division by a constant factor can be implemented simply by choosing\nappropriate ratios of input and feedback resistors, RF=R1 or R2=R1, in the circuits shown\nin figures 1(a) and (b), respectively.\n\u000f Integration may be effected by use of the Miller integrator of figure 1(c), for which\nC\ndVout\ndt\nC Vin\nR\nD 0 (3)\nso that the output is\nVout D \u2212 1\nRC\nZ t\n0\nVin dt (4)\nwith the time constant RC.\n\u000f Multiplication of two voltages is most conveniently performed by use of an analogue\nmultiplier IC, for example the Analog Devices AD534 or the Burr\u2013Brown MPY-100. The\noperation of these differential input ICs in multiplier mode can be as sketched in figure 1(d),\nfor which\nVout D 1\n8\n.Vx1 \u2212 Vx2\/.Vy1 \u2212 Vy2\/C .Vz1 \u2212 Vz2\/ (5)\nwhere the scale factor 8 is used to prevent the product voltage exceeding the specified\nmaximum. The default value 8 D 10 can be adjusted to suit particular situations. In what\nfollows, multipliers will often be shown in circuit block diagrams as though their inputs\nwere single-ended (rather than differential). In such cases, the appropriate input terminals\nare chosen so as to provide the desired sign of product at the output, and the other terminal\nof each pair is earthed.\n\u000f Division of two voltages can be performed, using the same multiplier ICs, but\nconnecting the output back into one of the inputs as shown in figure 1(e), in which case\nVout D 8.Vz2 \u2212 Vz1\/\n.Vx1 \u2212 Vx2\/ C Vy1: (6)\n\u000f Trigonometric functions can be implemented by use of, for example the Analog\nDevices AD639 universal trigonometric converter IC, which can be connected to transform\n   7\nFigure 1. Mathematical operations with analogue electronic circuits: (a) addition;\n(b) subtraction; (c) integration; (d) multiplication of two voltages; (e) division of two voltages;\n(f) generation of trigonometric functions; (g) generation of general functions. The respective\ntransformation equations are given in the text.\n8the input voltage into its sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, cotangent or their inverse\nfunctions. For example, it can be connected as indicated in figure 1(f), where the output\nvoltage is\nVout D 10 sin[50.V1 \u2212 V2\/]C V3: (7)\nHere, V1, V2 and V3 are in volts and the argument of the sine is in degrees. Obviously,\na cosine can be generated by setting either 50V1 or 50V2 to 90\u000e. A range of \u0006500\u000e is\naccommodated, but can effectively be extended where necessary by use of an analogue\nmultiplier IC to generate the double angle (see section 4.4 later).\n\u000f General functions can be created by use of a hybrid analogue=digital device as\nsketched in figure 1(g). The required function is held in the erasable programmable read-\nonly memory (EPROM) as a look-up table. The input voltage is digitized by the analogue\nto digital converter (ADC) and used to look up the corresponding number in the EPROM,\nwhich is then converted to a voltage at the output by the digital to analogue converter\n(DAC). Devices of this kind have been used, for example, to create trigonometric functions\n(Vogel et al 1987b) (before the corresponding converter ICs had become available), and for\ncreating the potential corresponding to a one-dimensional quantum-mechanical binary alloy\n(Stocks et al 1993a). The period of the clock used to drive such a device must, of course,\nbe very much shorter than all characteristic times in the system under study.\nIn assembling these circuit elements to model a given equation or system of equations,\nthere are several points to be borne in mind.\n(1) To minimize extraneous noise introduced by the circuit itself, the design should be\nsuch as to minimize the number of active components, for example operational amplifiers\nor analogue multipliers, as discussed by Fronzoni (1989).\n(2) Care must, of course, be taken to ensure that the voltage limits for the various\ncomponents are not exceeded. Thus, a typical circuit must operate within manufacturers\u2019\nspecifications not only under equilibrium conditions, but also when external forces are\ndriving it far from its stationary state: even the largest excursions to be expected must\nremain within design specifications, and not only at the output, but also at all intermediate\npoints too.\n(3) At the same time, care must also be taken to ensure that the signal is, at all points in\nthe circuit, larger (preferably much larger) than the background noise and drift produced by\nthe circuit itself. This requirement, taken with the preceding one, means that the dynamic\nrange of the analogue technique is necessarily limited: the maximum tolerable voltage\nswings are typically \u000610 V, and intrinsic noise is typically \u00060:5 mV peak-to-peak, giving\nan effective dynamic range of 2\u0002104. With careful circuit design, this is more than sufficient\nfor most purposes.\n(4) To speed up data acquisition, it is normal to scale time in such a way that time in\nthe model effectively runs much faster than real time. In doing so, care must be taken to\nremain within the allowed frequency limits of the active components; because the bandwidth\nis related to amplitude, it is usually best to compare expected and allowable slew rates.\nAgain, the validity of operation should be checked at all intermediate points, and not just\nat the output.\n(5) To reduce the effect of stray capacitance, connections should be made as short and\ndirect as possible, and the circuit layout planned accordingly. Where a circuit model is\nlikely to be needed for many different applications, or where particular stability is needed,\nit is worth designing and fabricating a special printed circuit board (PCB). In most cases,\nhowever, a simple mounting board into which the components can be inserted (with pressure\ncontacts) is sufficient, and is of course convenient in that modifications are fast and easy.\n    9\n(6) It is usually best to choose resistor values within (or not too far outside) the range\n10\u2013100 k, and capacitance values of at least 100 pF in view of the typical stray capacitance\nof a few pF.\nOptimization of the design requires that all of the above criteria should be taken into\naccount, but some degree of compromise between them is usually necessary in practice.\nMinimization of the number of active components can often be achieved by making judicious\ncombinations (in single circuit elements) of the separate arithmetic operations described\nabove.\nTo see how a circuit model can be designed in practice, we now consider a particular\nexample: the underdamped single-well Duffing oscillator used (Dykman et al 1994c) for\nexperiments on supernarrow spectral peaks and high-frequency stochastic resonance in a\nsystem with co-existing periodic attractors (see section 4.3 later). The equation to be\nmodelled is\nRx C 20 Px C !20x C \u03b3 x3 D F cos!F t C f .t\/ (8)\nwhere the oscillator is driven by a periodic force of amplitude F , frequency !F and f .t\/\nis the zero-mean white Gaussian noise of intensity D such that\nhf .t\/i D 0 hf .t\/f .s\/i D 40D\u000e.t \u2212 s\/: (9)\nThe circuit used to model (8) is shown in figure 2: two integrators are needed because of\nthe inertial term. The periodic force in the dashed box is set to zero for present purposes\n(but it will be needed in section 4.3 in the discussion of high-frequency stochastic resonance\nin the same system). We use primes to distinguish times and frequencies in the circuit (in\nunits of s and Hz) from the corresponding dimensionless times and frequencies that appear\nin equation (8). To understand the relationships between quantities in the circuit and in\n(8), we sum the currents at point A, and those at point B, and we equate them to zero in\neach case (using Kirchhoff\u2019s law and the fact that the input impedance of an operational\namplifier is effectively infinite).

Note that the multiplication of V 22 by \u00025\n(figure 2) is used to prevent the V 32 term being too small compared to background noise and\nvoltage offsets in the circuit, following the additional scaling by 0.1 in the second multiplier.\nThe relatively large value of R3 D 2:5 M was used to obtain a small value of the damping\nconstant 0. Under these circumstances, it is better to measure quantities like 0 and !0\nfor the completed circuit (McClintock et al 1993), treating it as an experimental object in\nits own right, rather than just calculating them from component values; the measured and\ncalculated values typically agree to within \u000610%.\n2.2. Noise generators\nExperiments are often undertaken to model systems driven by white noise. In reality, of\ncourse, white noise\u2014with zero correlation time and thus a power spectrum that remains\nflat up to infinite frequency\u2014is an idealization. Noise in real physical systems always\nhas a finite correlation time, and correspondingly a roll-off in the power spectrum above\nsome characteristic frequency. Provided that the correlation time of the noise is much\nsmaller (e.g. by a factor of 30) than all characteristic times (the vibration period(s) for an\nunderdamped system, or the relaxation time(s) for an overdamped one), the noise can be\nconsidered quasi-white and its effects will be indistinguishable from those of white noise\nwith the same intensity.\nA number of commercial noise generators have been used for experiments in\nstochastic nonlinear dynamics. These have included the Quan-Tech model 420 (no longer\nmanufactured) and, more recently, the Wandel and Goltermanny model RG1. The latter\nproduces Gaussian noise with a power spectrum that is flat to within \u00060:5 dB up to 108 kHz;\nabove this frequency, there is a very fast roll-off. It possesses the advantage that the output\nis genuinely random, with an essentially infinite repetition period. At the same time it\nhas the disadvantages that there is significant \u2018sag\u2019 of the power spectrum (though within\nspecification) in the intermediate frequency range and that it is relatively expensive.\ny Wandel u. Goltermann, 7410 Reutlingen, Germany.\n  11\nFor many purposes, however, a much cheaper and simpler \u2018home-made\u2019 noise generator\nwill suffice which, in some respects, is actually superior. This is the device used and\ndescribed by Faetti et al (1984, 1985) and Fronzoni (1989). It is based on the generation\nof a pseudo-random sequence by a linear-feedback shift register (Golomb 1967); the\ndichotomous (two-state) output is then filtered through a Miller integrator to produce (Rice\n1944) the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck (i.e. exponentially correlated) noise. In its original form, the\ndichotomous noise suffered from asymmetry in that the times spent in the upper and lower\nstates were systematically different on account of the OR-feedback being used (Tomlinson\nand Galvin 1975). Consequently, the distribution function of the approximately Gaussian\nnoise created after passage through the filter suffered from significant skewness. Faetti et al\n(1985) showed that this problem could be overcome by randomly inverting the sign of the\nfeedback voltage between EX-OR and EX-NOR. A version of this device (figure 3) used\nat Lancaster (Casademunt et al 1989c) employs the output from two different stages of the\nsame 17-stage feedback shift register (SR1) as feedback inverters for two separate 41-stage\n(Freeman 1988) shift registers (SR2 and SR3). In this way, two independent pseudo-random\npulse sequences are obtained which, after filtration, provide uncorrelated pseudo-white noise\nsources. With a clock frequency of \u00184 MHz, and the filter time constants set to give a\ncut-off above 40 kHz, the distribution functions at the output are Gaussian to more than\n\u00064 standard deviations and the repetition time of the pseudo-random time sequences is\n\u00186:5 days. There is no detectable \u2018sag\u2019 in the power spectrum. It is essential to remember\nthat these noise generators should not be used for experiments whose duration exceeds the\nrepetition time; in all other respects, however, they have been found entirely satisfactory.\nThe root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude of the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck noise being applied\nto a circuit model can conveniently be measured with a true RMS to DC converter such as\nFigure 3. A block diagram of the linear-feedback shift-register digital noise generators used\nat Lancaster, based on a design developed in the University of Pisa (Faetti et al 1984, 1985;\nFronzoni 1989). Pseudo-random dichotomous (two-level) pulse sequences are generated by the\n41-stage feedback shift-register SR2. The high-cut filter converts this dichotomous noise to an\noutput that is Gaussian and exponentially correlated, with a correlation time R2C2. The first\nfeedback shift register SR1 pseudo-randomly inverts the sign of the feedback in SR2, thereby\neliminating skewness of the distribution. An additional 41-stage feedback shift register SR3\n(not shown), taking its inverting input from stage 9 of SR1 but otherwise connected exactly\nlike SR2, provides a second independent noise source. FF is a flip-flop that divides the 4 MHz\nclock frequency by a factor of 32, and X1\u2013X4 are exclusive-OR gates. The low-frequency\ncut-off, determined by R1C1, is fixed at \u00181 Hz, and the high-frequency cut-off is adjustable.\nThe output noise finally passes through a variable-gain operational amplifier (not shown) before\nbeing applied to an experiment.\n12\nthe Analog Devices AD536A IC. It is then necessary to relate this value (in volts) to the\nintensity D of white noise appearing in model equations such as (8) and (9). To do so, we\nnote that Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck noise is exponentially correlated, with\nhf .t\/f .s\/i D 20D\n\u001cN\ne\u2212jt\u2212sj=\u001cN (16)\nwhere \u001cN is the correlation time. Thus, the mean-square noise amplitude is\nhf 2.t\/i D 20D\n\u001cN\n: (17)\nBut the circuit operates in scaled time, so that\n\u001cN D \u001cOU\n\u001c\n(18)\nwhere \u001cOU is the measured or calculated correlation time of the noise (in seconds), and \u001c is\nthe time scaling of the model, given by equation (15) in the example in section 2.1. Hence,\nD D\n\u0012\n\u001cOU\n20\u001c\n\u0013\nhf 2.t\/i: (19)\nHere, hf 2.t\/i can be measured directly. Values of all the other parameters are also known,\nbecause they can be calculated from the component values or measured directly. Thus (19)\nprovides the required connection between D and the RMS noise voltage measured by the\ntrue RMS to DC converter IC.\nNote that the fast roll-off of some commercial noise generators, such as the Wandel\nand Goltermann model mentioned above, means that they do not produce Ornstein\u2013\nUhlenbeck noise as they stand. Passage of the output through a Miller integrator with a\ntime constant of at least \u00181 ms (for a roll-off at 100 kHz) will perform the necessary\nconversion. If the integrating filter has a smaller time constant than this, however,\nmisleading results can be obtained: the output may seem to correspond to Ornstein\u2013\nUhlenbeck noise, but it is deficient in high-frequency components, so there is likely to\nbe poor agreement between the apparent D measured for the model and the D that appears\nin the equations.\n2.3. Signal acquisition and analysis\nAnalysis of the behaviour of the circuit model usually involves two main stages: digitization\nof the analogue signal x.t\/ (V2.t\/ in the above example); and then processing of the resultant\ndigital time series to extract the particular information required, which is often in the form\nof a statistical distribution.\nThe first 12 years of stochastic=nonlinear research by the Lancaster group, including a\nlarge proportion of the work described below, depended on the use of Nicolet data processors\n(models NIC-80, NIC-1180 and NIC-1280) both to digitize and analyse the signals. These\nwere quite remarkable instruments for their time, but are now obsolete and are currently\nbeing replaced by PC-based equivalent systems with enhanced capabilities.\nThere is now a very wide range of ADC cards available for operation in PCs. From\ntime to time, helpful reviews are published (see, for example, Barton 1991, Rand 1994)\nwhich may help in the selection of the most suitable device for a particular application.\nAmongst other factors, it will be necessary to consider: the number of bits required for\nthe digitized signal (12-bits has been standard, but 16-bit ADCs are now becoming more\nwidely available); the minimum sample interval (values below 1 \u0016s are not normally\nneeded, and 10 \u0016s is short enough for most purposes), the speed limits being largely\n  13\ndetermined by those of the standard ICs used for the models, and the fact that the latter\nusually involve open mounting boards without optimized high-speed component layout; the\nmaximum block size (number of consecutive data samples without gaps) required, which\nin some cases will involve continuous acquisition (no data gaps); and whether or not a\ndigital signal processing (DSP) or other type of co-processor is required on the card. If\nfast data acquisition without gaps\u2014coupled with intensive processing\u2014is needed, a co-\nprocessor is likely to be essential. The advantage is that most of the data processing can\nthen take place on the card itself, with relatively infrequent transfers of input data and\nensemble-averaged distribution to the main memory. The PC\u2019s central processing unit\n(CPU) thus remains free to operate displays of the input and averaged data, interact with\nthe user, and service the \u2018housekeeping\u2019 needs of the operating system. If the required\ndistributions are of a conventional kind (e.g. power spectra), a DSP co-processor is likely\nto be best. For creating less common types of distribution (see later), a more flexible\ntype of co-processor is likely to be preferable. The systems currently in use and under\ndevelopment at Lancaster are based on the Microstary model DAP 3200a=415 (12-bit)\nand DAP 3216=415 (16-bit) ADCs, each of which incorporates an on-board 100 MHz\nIntel 486DX co-processor.\nIn practice, most of the experiments require purpose-designed software. Thus, although\nsingle-variable probability distributions or power spectra may be available as parts of\ncommercial packages, the numerous other types of distribution that are of interest will\nin most cases need to be programmed specially. These will include (see later), for example,\nprehistory probability densities, time-evolving distributions in one or more variables, first\npassage time distributions, sojourn time distributions for two-variable systems with two or\nmore attractors, provision for measuring a variety of distributions related to the centre-of-\nmotion of a system driven by quasimonochromatic noise (QMN), and many others. Even for\nseemingly standard applications, minor but essential variations in the required processing\nmay necessitate coding the software specially, for example the need to subtract a time-\ndomain ensemble average of the input before processing each block to calculate power\nspectra. In any case, to optimize the rate of data acquisition=processing, it will often be\nnecessary to design a system that will exploit a co-processor to do most of the work as\ndescribed above, which will not usually be possible with a standard package. The particular\nadvantage of the Microstar co-processor is that it may be programmed using the same\ncompilers and support software that are already in use with the host PC, which simplifies\nthe task considerably.\n3. Large rare fluctuations\nPerhaps one of the most convincing demonstrations of how simple analogue electronic\ntechniques can be used to develop a new experimental approach, and to obtain direct\nexperimental insight into long-standing problems of fundamental importance, is through\nits application to the investigation of large fluctuations.\n3.1. The concept of large fluctuations\nThe concept of large fluctuations was discussed by Boltzmann (1904). In a great many\ncases, the characteristic fluctuation intensity D is small, and large fluctuation events, in\ny Microstar Laboratories Inc, 2265 116th Avenue NE, Bellevue, WA 98004, USA; and see\nhttp:\/\/www.mstarlabs.com\/. The UK distributor is: Amplicon Liveline Ltd, Centenary Industrial Estate,\nHollindean Road, Brighton BN2 4AW.\n14\nwhich the system moves far away from its stable state(s) in the phase space, are very rare.\nAlthough infrequent, large fluctuations can be responsible for big qualitative changes in\na system, and they therefore play a crucial role in numerous important phenomena, for\nexample nucleation at phase transitions, chemical reactions, mutations in DNA sequences,\nprotein transport in biological cells and failures of electronic devices.\nIn many cases the fluctuating systems of interest are far from thermal equilibrium.\nExamples include lasers, pattern forming systems (Cross and Hohenberg 1993), trapped\nelectrons which display bistability and switching in a strong periodic field (Gabrielse\net al 1985, Dehmelt 1990, Tan and Gabrielse 1993) and spatially periodic systems\n(ratchets) which display a unidirectional current when driven away from thermal equilibrium\n(Magnasco 1993, Astumian and Bier 1994, Millonas and Dykman 1994, Prost et al 1994,\nDoering et al 1994, Leibler 1994, Millonas 1995, Hondou and Sawada 1995, Marchesoni\n1996, Dykman et al 1997a). Other examples are discussed in section 4 in the context of\nstochastic resonance.\nThe analysis of large fluctuations requires the solution of two closely interrelated\nproblems. The first is the evaluation of the probability density \u001a.x\/ for a system to occupy\na state x far from the stable state xst in the phase space. In the stationary regime, the\nfunction \u001a.x\/ is independent of time and has a maximum at xst. The tails of \u001a.x\/ are\ndetermined by the probabilities of large fluctuations.\nThe other problem is that of the fluctuational paths along which the system moves\nwhen a large fluctuation occurs. The distribution of fluctuational paths is a fundamental\ncharacteristic of the fluctuation dynamics , and its understanding paves the way to developing\ntechniques for controlling fluctuations. Its importance for gaining insight into the physics\nof fluctuations from a dynamical perspective was recognized more than 40 years ago by\nOnsager and Machlup (1953). A theoretical understanding, and basic techniques for treating\nthe problem, have been developed since that time; but it was not until recently (Dykman\net al 1992c) that a method for observing the distribution of fluctuational paths for large\nfluctuations was proposed and implemented by analogue simulation.\nA simple qualitative idea behind the theory of large fluctuations in noise-driven systems\nis that such fluctuations result from large outbursts of noise f.t\/ that push the system\nfar from the attractor. The probabilities of large outbursts are small, and the value of\nthe probability density \u001a.xf \/ for a given remote xf will actually be determined by the\nprobability of the most probable outburst of those capable of bringing the system to xf .\nThis particular realization of noise is just the optimal fluctuational force fopt.t\/ for the given\nxf . Because a realization (a path) of noise f.t\/ results in the corresponding realization\nof the dynamical variable x.t\/ (Feynman and Hibbs 1965), there also exists an optimal\npath xopt (tIxf ) along which the system arrives at xf , with overwhelming probability.\nFrom a different perspective, optimal paths xopt (tIxf ) were first described for nonlinear\nnon-equilibrium Markov systems by Ventcel\u2019 and Freidlin (1970). (Note that \u2018Ventcel\u201d is\noften, and more correctly, spelled Wentzell in the literature.) Using another approach, the\nanalysis of the tails of the distribution was also performed by Graham (1973), whereas the\napproach described above was suggested independently by Dykman and Krivoglaz (1979)\nin the context of escape from a metastable state. This approach is not limited to Markov\nsystems (Dykman and Krivoglaz 1984, Dykman 1990). For systems driven by Ornstein\u2013\nUhlenbeck noise, optimal paths were discussed by Luciani and Verga (1987, 1988), Tsironis\nand Grigolini (1988), Bray and McKane (1989), McKane (1989), Wio et al (1989), McKane\net al (1990), Bray et al (1990) and Luckock and McKane (1990), whereas an equivalent\neikonal formulation was developed by K losek-Dygas et al (1988a, b, 1989). The general\ncase of Gaussian noise was discussed by Dykman (1990) and Dykman and Smelyanskiy\n  15\n(1998a) (see section 6) and by Einchcomb and McKane (1994, 1995). Reviews of related\nwork on fluctuations in systems driven by coloured noise were given by Lindenberg et al\n(1989b) and by Dykman and Lindenberg (1994).\nThe major qualitative result of the theory of optimal paths in classical systems is that\nthese paths are real physical trajectories (see Dykman 1990). Although the arrival at a\ngiven state xf is the result of a fluctuation, the motion on the way to this state is essentially\ndeterministic. It occurs in real time, in the space of the dynamical variables of the system.\nIn other words, if we find a system in a given state far from an attractor, and we know that\nthe system had been fluctuating about that attractor for a time much longer than either the\nrelaxation time or the correlation time of the fluctuating bath (or the driving noise), then\nwe can tell with high probability how the system moved to this state. To some extent this\nstatement is counterintuitive, as our daily experience tells us (Lebowitz 1993) that, if we\nfind the system far away from its stable equilibrium, it means that it had been prepared even\nfurther away from equilibrium, and we just happened to find it on its way to equilibrium.\nHowever, as shown by Einstein (1910), large fluctuations may still happen even in the\nequilibrium state, at the expense of a (very unlikely, yet possible) decrease in entropy.\nThe optimal path concept shows that this decrease develops in time in a certain optimal\nway.\nOptimal fluctuational paths are a counterpart of the relaxational paths in the absence of\nfluctuations, and they have also much in common with rays in geometrical optics and with\nWKB trajectories in quantum mechanics. Optimal fluctuational paths and rays both represent\nthe most likely ways to be followed. Formally, they are the paths that provide extrema\nto certain functionals (the least action principle). The pattern of rays in optics displays\nsingularities (Berry 1976, 1977), and therefore similar singularities might be expected in\nthe pattern of optimal paths. And indeed, they seemed to appear when the appropriate\nequations of motion were solved formally (Jauslin 1987b, Day 1987, Chinarov et al 1993,\nMaier and Stein 1993a, b, 1996b). It gave rise to concern about the applicability of the\nmethod near singularities (Risken 1993). However, it was soon realized that the observable\nsingularities of the pattern of optimal fluctuational paths may be different from those in\ngeometrical optics (Jauslin 1987b, Dykman 1990). It was shown recently that, for Markov\nsystems, the singularities can be understood and classified using topological arguments\n(Dykman et al 1994d, Smelyanksiy et al 1997a). Nevertheless, the very prediction of an\nonset of singularities is a challenge to experiment.\nThe notion of the optimal fluctuational path being a counterpart of the relaxational path in\nthe absence of fluctuations has long been a major tool for tackling fluctuation dynamics. Yet,\nuntil recently, there was no direct experimental evidence in support of the idea. Arguably,\ntherefore, the theory was based on an act of faith. One experimental problem was that, if\nthe noise intensity is too small, it is hard to obtain good statistics for arrivals of the system\nat a remote state whereas, if the noise intensity is too large so that the required fluctuations\nhappen often, the notion of the optimal path becomes irrelevant. Another problem was that\nexperiments on optimal fluctuational paths could not be undertaken systematically until the\nappropriate statistical quantity, the prehistory probability distribution (Dykman et al 1992c),\nhad been introduced.\nIn this situation, analogue electronic models have provided an ideal opportunity for\nthe development of new experimental techniques, based on measurements of the prehistory\nprobability distribution. As we shall see, they led to the first direct experimental observations\nof the dynamics of large fluctuations in noise-driven systems. Note that similar behaviour\nis to be expected not only of noise-driven systems, but of other fluctuating systems as\nwell.\n16\n3.2. Prehistory probability distribution\nTo investigate the dynamics of large fluctuations in the stationary regime, one may adopt\nan approach (Dykman et al 1992c) in which one accumulates the information about all\narrivals of the system in the close vicinity of a chosen state xf . In the experiments the\nstate of the system is monitored continuously. Two such events, where the trajectory of a\none-variable system passed through xf , are shown in figure 4. The interesting region of the\npath\u2014the fluctuational part f coming to xf\u2014is then stored. An ensemble-average of such\ntrajectories (see later), built up over a period of continuous monitoring (typically weeks),\ncreates the prehistory probability distribution ph.x; tIxf ; tf \/ (Dykman et al 1992c). If a\npoint xf lies far from the attractor, so that the stationary probability density \u001a.xf \/ is small,\nthe time intervals between successive passages of xf will be large; they will considerably\nexceed both the characteristic relaxation time of the system, \u001cr, and the noise correlation\ntime, \u001cc. The arrivals of the system at xf are, therefore, mutually uncorrelated. Since the\nmoment of observation tf is the only instant of time singled out under stationary conditions,\nthe prehistory probability distribution can be consistently defined as the probability density\nph.x; tIxf tf \/ \u0011 \u001a.xi ; tiIx; tIxf ; tf \/ of the system being at x at time t if it was at xf at\ntime tf (where tf > t), with ti !\u22121, and xi close to the attractor xeq.\nFigure 4. Fluctuational behaviour measured and calculated for a simple one-dimensional model\nequilibrium system: the double-well Duffing oscillator with K.x\/ D x \u2212 x3, for D D 0:014 in\n(21), (32). Two typical fluctuations (jagged lines) from the stable state at S D \u22121 to the remote\nstate xf D \u22120:1 and back again are compared with the calculated deterministic relaxational path\nfrom xf to S (full, smooth, curve) and the calculated time-reversed relaxational path from S to\nxf (dashed curve) (Luchinsky 1997).\nWe stress that ph.x; tIxf ; tf \/ is not a standard two-time transition probability: it is given\nby a ratio of the transition probability \u001a.xf ; tf Ix; t j xi ; ti\/, (the conditional probability\ndensity for a system placed initially at xi to pass through the states x and xf at the\ninstants t and tf , respectively), to the two-time transition probability \u001a.xf ; tf j xi ; ti\/, with\nthe limit being taken in which the initial instant ti goes to \u22121 (however, in the case of\nfluctuations from a metastable state we assume that the time interval tf \u2212 ti is less than the\nlifetime of the state). A similar ratio of transition probabilities was considered for Markov\nprocesses by Schulman (1991) in order to clarify discussions about the relationship between\nthe thermodynamic and cosmological arrows of time.\n  17\nIn the original paper (Dykman et al 1992c) the distribution ph.x; tIxf ; tf \/ was\nintroduced in such a form that the definition applies both to Markov and non-Markov\nsystems, as the distribution is expressed in terms of the probability density functional\nP[x.t\/] of the paths x.t\/ of a noise-driven system,\nph.x; tIxf ; tf \/ D \u001a.xf ; tf Ix; t j xi ; ti\/=\u001a.xf ; tf j xi ; ti\/\nph.x; tIxf ; tf \/ D\nZ x.tf \/Dxf\nx.ti \/\u0019xeq.ti \/\nDx.t 0\/\u000e.x.t\/\u2212 x\/P[x.t\/]\n\u0002\n\u0012Z x.tf \/Dxf\nx.ti \/\u0019xeq.ti \/\nDx.t 0\/P[x.t\/]\n\u0013\u22121\nti !\u22121: (20)\nWe note that the initial value of x.ti\/ for t !\u22121 in (20) may in fact be arbitrary, provided\n(t \u2212 ti) and (tf \u2212 ti) substantially exceed \u001cr and \u001cc, so that the system becomes randomized\nand will have forgotten its initial position before the start of the fluctuation bringing it to xf\nat tf . In this section we will limit our analysis to Markov processes, and we will consider\ntwo types of systems: stationary and periodically driven. In the latter case the position of\nthe stable state xeq.t\/ in (20) is a periodic function of time, and we will assume that it has\nthe same period as the driving force.\nThe physical significance of the prehistory probability density ph.x; tIxf ; tf \/ follows\nfrom the fact that, since the optimal path xopt.t \u2212 tf Ixf \/ is the most probable path for\nreaching xf , the function ph.x; tIxf ; tf \/ at a given t \u2212 tf should have a sharp maximum\nin x lying on that path, x D xopt.t \u2212 tf Ixf ). Therefore, by investigating the prehistory\nprobability density ph.x; tIxf ; 0\/ experimentally one can find not only the optimal paths\nthemselves, but also test immediately the very concepts of the optimal path and the optimal\nfluctuation, and establish the range of parameters and the area of phase space within which\noptimal paths are well defined, i.e. where the tube of fluctuational paths around an optimal\npath is narrow.\nA model fluctuating system which is convenient for simulations and which makes it\npossible to reveal optimal paths and singular features of the distribution of paths is an\noverdamped Brownian particle driven both by a regular force K.x; t\/ and by a random\nforce with the same number of independent components as the number of the particle\ncoordinates. We will assume the regular force to be time periodic and\/or non-gradient, in\ngeneral. The Langevin equation of motion of the system is of the form\nPx DK.x; t\/C f.t\/ (21)\nhfi.t\/i D 0 hfi.t1\/fj .t2\/i D D\u000eij \u000e.t1 \u2212 t2\/:\nWe assume the random force f.t\/ to be a zero-mean white Gaussian noise, of intensity D.\nThe model (21) describes the fluctuational dynamics of a wide class of macroscopic\ndissipative systems (Zwanzig 1973, Haken 1975, Kubo et al 1978, Risken 1993). It has\nnumerous counterparts in spatially extended systems, in which case x is a coordinate-\ndependent field (an order parameter), as discussed by Hohenberg and Halperin (1977) and\nCross and Hohenberg (1993) (see the papers by Graham and Te\u00b4l (1990) and Smelyanskiy\net al (1997b) and references therein for a discussion of the work on large fluctuations in\ncontinuous systems lacking detailed balance).\nThe probability density functional for a Markovian system (21) can be written as\nP[x.t\/] D exp.\u2212S[x.t\/]=D\/: (22)\nTo lowest order in the noise intensity, S[x.t\/] takes the form of the action functional for an\n18 \nauxiliary dynamical system with the Lagrangian L.

Optimal paths\nprovide the global minimum to the action S[x]. It is clear from (20) and (28) that, for\nsmall D, these are optimal paths that possess physical significance, and not just extreme\npaths (26).\n  19\n3.2.1. System in equilibrium with thermal bath. The equations of motion (26) can easily be\nsolved if the system is in equilibrium with a thermal bath, in which case the force K.x; t\/\nis independent of time and is a gradient force, i.e. K.x; t\/ D \u2212rU.x\/, so that\nPxopt DrU.xopt\/ popt D 2rU.xopt\/ S.x\/ D 2U.x\/: (29)\nIt can be seen that the optimal fluctuational trajectory in this case is a mirror image (with\nrespect to time) of the deterministic relaxational trajectory Px D \u2212rU.x\/. This is a\nconsequence of the principle of the symmetry of fluctuations with respect to time inversion\nfor classical systems in thermal equilibrium in the absence of magnetic fields and rotation\n(Landau and Lifshitz 1980); see also section 3.2.3.\nThe existence of such optimal paths has been tested experimentally (Dykman et al\n1992c) by investigation of the fluctuations of an electronic circuit modelling the system of\ninterest, for which the system (21) corresponded to one-dimensional motion in the quartic\nbistable potential\nU.x\/ D \u2212 12x2 C 14x4 (30)\ndriven by external white noise. Because no additional forces were applied, the system\ncould be considered to be in thermal equilibrium at a temperature determined by the noise\nintensity and the damping constant, which are linked by the fluctuation dissipation theorem\n(Landau and Lifshitz 1980). The corresponding Langevin equation\nPx D x \u2212 x3 C f .t\/ hf .t1\/f .t2\/i D D\u000e.t1 \u2212 t2\/ (31)\nwas modelled with the circuit shown in figure 5(a).

The moment at which x.t\/ eventually\nreached a pre-set value xf was noted, and the path by which it had reached that point\nwas recorded. The process was then repeated, so as to build up an ensemble average of\nthe paths leading to xf . A typical example of the resultant prehistory probability density\nph.x; tI xf ; 0\/ is shown in figure 5(b). These results demonstrated (Dykman et al 1992c) for\n20\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 5.

Note that, although this experimental investigation, like all of the Lancaster\nnonlinear research up to 1996, was carried out with a Nicolet data processor, the more recent\nstudies of large fluctuations described below depend on the PC-based Microstar ADC system\ndescribed in section 2.3.\n3.2.2. System without detailed balance. For a non-potential or time-dependent force\nK.xI t\/ the Hamiltonian equations (26) with boundary conditions (27) become non-\nintegrable, generally speaking. The solutions of these equations can only be obtained in\nspecial cases, like in the case where the initial fluctuating system is underdamped (Dykman\nand Krivoglaz 1979, Ben-Jacob et al 1982) or where the drift coefficients K have a special\nsymmetry (Ventcel\u2019 and Freidlin 1970, Graham and Te\u00b4l 1986). In general, when solving the\n  21\nHamiltonian equations one should be prepared to obtain singularities known in geometrical\noptics (Berry 1976), and also chaos. However, as we have mentioned before and will also\noutline later, the observable singularities in the pattern of optimal paths turn out to be\ndifferent (Dykman et al 1994e).\nIt was first appreciated by Graham and Te\u00b4l (1984a, b) that, since the simplest non-\nintegrable Hamiltonian system is the one with one degree of freedom and with the\nHamiltonian that periodically depends on time (Guckenheimer and Holmes 1983), the\nsimplest fluctuating system which may display singularities in the stationary probability\ndistribution is an overdamped periodically-driven system with one degree of freedom.\nRespectively, the pattern of optimal paths of such a system should display singularities\nas well (Dykman et al 1996c, 1997a).\nThe simplest appropriate model is that of an overdamped fluctuating system driven by\nan additive sinusoidal force,\nPx D K.xI t\/C f .t\/ K.xI t\/ D \u2212U 0.x\/C A cost\nU.x\/ D \u2212 12x2 C 14x4: (32)\nThe model (32) has attracted a lot of attention recently in the context of stochastic resonance\n(see section 4). We consider a situation that is both non-adiabatic and nonlinear : neither\n nor A need be small; only the noise intensity D will be assumed small.\nSince the Hamiltonian H.x; pI t\/ is periodic in t , the set of paths fx.t\/; p.t\/g is also\nperiodic: the paths that arrive at a point (xf ; tf ) are the same as the paths that arrive at the\npoint (xf ; tf C 2\u0019=), but shifted in time by the period 2\u0019=. Note, however, that any\ngiven individual optimal path is not itself periodic in time.\nTo acquire topological insight into the pattern of singularities of optimal paths (Dykman\net al 1994e, Dykman and Smelyanskiy 1998b) we note that trajectories emanating from\na stationary state lie on a Lagrangian manifold (LM) (Arnol\u2019d 1978) in phase space\n(x; t; p D @S=@x) (the unstable manifold of the corresponding state) and form a one-\nparameter set. The action S.x; t\/ is a smooth single-valued function of position on the LM.\nIt is a Lyapunov function: it is non-decreasing along the trajectories of the initial system\nin the absence of noise Px D K.xI t\/. The projections of trajectories in phase space onto\nconfiguration space form the extreme paths. Optimal paths are the extreme paths that give\nthe minimal action to reach a given point (x; t) in the configuration space. These are the\noptimal paths that can be visualized in an experiment via measurements of the prehistory\nprobability distribution.\nA periodically-driven system, being a system with 1.5 degrees of freedom (the coordinate\nand time), provides a good opportunity to look into (at least some of) the generic singularities\nof the optimal paths. The pattern of extreme paths, the LM and action surfaces calculated\n(Dykman et al 1997c) for the overdamped periodically-driven oscillator (32) are shown in\nfigure 6. It can be seen from figure 6 that, although there is only one path to a point (x; t; p)\nin phase space, several different extreme paths may come from the stationary periodic state\nto the corresponding point (x; t) in configuration space. These paths cross each other. This\nis a consequence of folding of the Lagrangian manifold.\nA generic feature related to the folding of LMs is the occurrence of caustics in the\npattern of extreme paths. Caustics are projections of the folds of an LM. They start at cusp\npoints. Clearly, the area of the configuration space behind a caustic may not be reached\nalong the paths that encounter it. If these paths formed the probability distribution in the\ncorresponding range of dynamical variables, this distribution would be singular: the situation\nhere is different from that with caustics in the WKB, as, in contrast to the wavefunction\nwhich is decaying on one side of the caustic and oscillating on the other side, the probability\n22\nFigure 6. From top to bottom: action surface, Lagrangian manifold (LM) and extreme paths\ncalculated for the system (32) using equations (26) with the initial conditions discussed by\nDykman et al (1997b, c). They correspond to the analogue electronic circuit in figure 5(a), but\nwith a periodic external force added as shown in that figure in the dashed box. Parameters for\nthe system were: A D 0:264, ! D 1:2. To clarify interrelations between singularities in the\noptimal paths pattern, action surface and LM surface, they are shown in a single figure: the\naction surface has been shifted up by one unit, and the LM scaled by a factor 1=2 and shifted\nup by 0.4.\ndistribution may not oscillate. Therefore, encountering a caustic is inappropriate, on a\nphysical basis, and one would expect that the caustic should be \u2018hidden\u2019.\nThe avoidance of caustics was analysed by Dykman et al (1994e) and can be understood\nfrom figure 6. It can be seen in figure 6 that the folds of the LM merge at the cusp point.\nThe structure of an LM with two folds merging at the cusp gives rise to a swallowtail-type\nsingularity in the action surface. The spinode edges of the action surface correspond to the\ncaustics. The lower sheets of the action surface intersect along a line the projection of which\non the coordinate place can be called a switching line. The switching line separates regions\nwhich are reached along different optimal paths, namely, the paths which correspond to\nthe smaller value of the action. The switching line starts from the cusp point. The optimal\npaths terminate on the switching line prior to a caustic being encountered. This topological\npicture is generic (Dykman et al 1994e, Smelyanskiy et al 1997a), it explains both how\ncaustics are avoided and what are the observable singularities of the pattern of optimal paths.\nThe first numerical results on the formation of the singularities, avoidance of caustics and\nformation of switching lines in systems lacking detailed balance were obtained by Day\n(1987) and Jauslin (1987b), and the occurrence and avoidance of a turning point for a\ncoloured-noise-driven system was obtained analytically by Dykman (1990). The generic\ntopological features of the pattern of optimal paths had not been observed in experiments\nuntil the introduction of the analogue electronic approach that we describe later (see also\nsection 6.4).\n  23\nIn addition to the fact that large fluctuations occur only occasionally, their experimental\ninvestigation in non-equilibrium systems is also complicated by the fact that the coordinate\nspace, in general, has two or more dimensions. This makes periodically-driven systems\nparticularly advantageous for the analysis of the prehistory problem as the \u2018extra\u2019\ncoordinate is time, which is one of the variables of the prehistory probability distribution\nanyway.\nThe problem of statistics can be overcome, at least in part, by using a multichannel\ntechnique. Several dynamical variables of the system and the external force are recorded\nsimultaneously, and then the statistics of all actual trajectories along which the system moves\nin a particular subspace of the coordinate space are analysed. Information about stochastic\nprocesses obtained in this way is much more detailed than that obtained by the standard\nmethod of measuring stationary probability distributions. In our technique, not only do we\ncount rare events (i.e. arrivals of the system at a given point in configuration space), but\nwe also learn how each of these events comes about.\nThe technique has been applied to the analysis of fluctuational dynamics in the analogue\nelectronic circuit model of (32) shown in figure 5(a), with A0 6D 0. An experimentally\nmeasured prehistory probability distribution for arrival at a particular point in configuration\nspace is shown in figure 7. It is clear that the distribution is sharp and has a well defined\nridge. From the top-plane plot and from the direct comparisons in figure 8, it is evident that\nsuch ridges follow very closely the theoretical trajectories obtained by solving numerically\nthe equations of motion for the optimal paths (26).\nFigure 7.

The maxima\nof the distributions represent the optimal paths. The theoretical extreme paths and a contour\nplot of the distribution are shown on the top plane (Dykman et al 1997c).\n24\n3.2.3. Width of the tube of fluctuational paths. Further insight into the physical meaning\nof the prehistory probability distribution can be gained from an analysis of the width of this\ndistribution. The distribution broadening is due to the fact that, although the system is most\nlikely to move to a given state along the optimal path, the actual fluctuational trajectories\ndeviate from the optimal path. Therefore, the width of the tube of the paths for arrival to a\ngiven state is finite. This width is a fundamental characteristic of the fluctuation dynamics,\nand it is this width that is given by the width of the prehistory distribution.\nSome calculated and measured widths are shown in the inset of figure 8 (Dykman et al\n1996c). The theoretical technique developed in the cited paper is based on the analysis of\nthe general expression for the prehistory probability distribution (20). To evaluate the path\nintegral in this expression for the periodically-driven system (32) one expands the coordinate\nx.t\/ into the orthonormal functions  n.t\/ which diagonalize the second variation of the\naction,\nx.t\/ D xopt.t j xf ; tf \/C\nX\nn\nan n.t\/: (33)\nFigure 8.

As shown in the inset of figure 8,\nequations (25) and (37) provide an excellent description of the experimental data.\n3.2.4. Critical behaviour of the paths distribution. The only generic structurally stable\nsingularities of the pattern of extreme paths of S[x] (23) in two-dimensional (2D) systems\nare caustics and cusps (Arnol\u2019d 1992). Since caustics may not be observed in the pattern\nof optimal paths, it is particularly interesting to investigate the distribution ph near cusp\npoints. At the cusp (xc; tc) one of the eigenvalues \u0015n becomes equal to zero (Berry 1976,\nSchulman 1996) (we assume that this happens to the eigenvalue \u00150). Equation (36) does\nnot apply if the final point (xf ; tf ) is close to (xc; tc); in particular, \u001b diverges for \u00150 D 0.\nIn a certain sense a cusp point is similar to the critical point of the first-order phase\ntransition. On one side of the cusp point there exists an area which can be reached along the\npaths that belong to one or other of two coexisting types. This is similar to the occurrence\nof two coexisting phases on one side of a critical point. The switching line is an analogue\nof the phase transition line. As in the case of the critical point, the motion of the system\nis slowed down near the cusp point, and there arises a \u2018soft mode\u2019  c0.t\/. Therefore, the\nwidth of the prehistory probability distribution should critically increase.\nIn contrast to a true critical point, at the cusp point the spectrum \u0015n is discrete,\nand therefore one would expect that Landau-type theory should apply to the prehistory\ndistribution. We now present results for the case where the final point (xf ; tf ) is precisely\nthe cusp (Dykman et al 1996c).\n26\nIt is known from optics and quantum mechanics (Berry 1976, Schulman 1996) that at\nthe cusp point it is necessary to keep, in the expansion of the action S (35), the higher-order\nterms in the amplitude a0 of the \u2018soft mode\u2019  0.t\/,\nS[x.t\/] D S.xc; tc\/C sc.fang\/ sc.fang\/ \u0019 14g0a\n4\n0 C\n1\n2\nX\nn>0\n\u0015na\n2\nn C\n1\n2\na20\nX\nn>0\ngnan (38)\n0.t\/ \u0011  c0.t\/ \/ exp\n\u0014 Z t\ndt 0 \f.t 0\/\n\u0015\n:\nAbsence of the term a30 in the expansion (38) is the signature of the fact that we are dealing\nwith the cusp point. We note that all eigenvalues \u0015n are positive if the final state (xf ; tf )\nlies near the stable state, and they change sign along extreme paths only provided such a\npath encounters a caustic, which does not happen for physically meaningful extreme paths,\nthat is for optimal fluctuational paths. A cusp point is the only point on the optimal path\nwhere the eigenvalue \u00150 becomes equal to zero.\nIf we change to integration over the coefficients an in the path integral (20), and\nintegrate over all an>0 with account taken of equations (35) and (38) we obtain the prehistory\nprobability distribution for the paths coming to the cusp point in the form\nph.x; tI xc; tc\/ D Mc\nZ 1\n\u22121\nda0 exp[\u2212F.a0jxc; tc\/=D]\n\u0002 exp\n\u0014\n\u2212 [x \u2212 xopt.t j xc; tc\/\u2212 a0 c0.t\/]\n2\n2D\u001b 2c .t j xc; tc\/\n\u0015\n(39)\nF.a0 j xc; tc\/ D 14ga\n4\n0 g D g0 \u2212\n1\n2\nX\nn>0\n\u0015\u22121n g\n2\nn:\nThe function \u001b 2c in (39) is given by equation (36) with the term n D 0 being eliminated\nfrom the sum; Mc \u0011 Mc.t\/ is a normalization constant.\nVery close to the cusp point, i.e. for very small (tc \u2212 t) the shape of the distribution\n(39) is dominated by diffusion, so that the distribution is Gaussian; the term a0 c0 can be\nneglected, and \u001bc.t\/ \u0019 .tc \u2212 t\/1=2.\nFor larger (tc \u2212 t) we have from (39)\nph.x; tI xc; tc\/ D QMc exp\n\u001a\n\u2212 g\n4D\n\u0014\nx \u2212 xopt.t j xc; tc\/\n c0.t\/\n\u00154\u001b\n\u001cr & tc \u2212 t \u001d D1=2g1=2= P 2c0.tc\/: (40)\nEquation (40) shows that, at the cusp point, fluctuations about the optimal path become\nstrongly non-Gaussian, and there occurs critical broadening of the paths distribution. In the\nrange (40) the shape of the distribution of fluctuational paths to the cusp point is described\nby the Landau-type expression for the distribution of fluctuations of the order parameter\nnear the critical point, with the width being dependent on the distance t \u2212 tc to the cusp\npoint along the optimal path. The prehistory probability distribution can be used to reveal\nthis new critical effect.\nThe characteristic width of the distribution (40) is \u0018D1=4, and its broadening is\ndetermined by the soft mode  c0.t\/. This mode is localized within the range tc\u2212 t . \u001cr. For\ntc\u2212 t \u001d \u001cr the distribution (39) goes over into the stationary Gaussian distribution about the\nattractor xeq.t\/. The measured and calculated evolutions of the distribution with (tc\u2212 t) are\nin good agreement: see figure 9. The critical behaviour of the distribution of paths coming\nto a cusp point is much more pronounced than that of the statistical distribution near a cusp,\n  27\nFigure 9. Cross sections of the prehistory probability distribution for fluctuations to the cusp\npoint in figure 8 (xc \u0019 \u22120:70; tc \u0019 7:69) for three values of t . The distribution is Gaussian\nvery close to, and far from, the cusp; but is critically broadened and strongly non-Gaussian,\ncf equation (40), at intermediate values of t (Dykman et al 1996c).\nwhere it is seen primarily in a blowing up of the prefactor (Dykman et al 1994e, Maier and\nStein 1996a).\n3.3. Time asymmetry of classical fluctuations\nThe results discussed briefly above demonstrate clearly that patterns of optimal paths, and\nsome of the singularities in these patterns, are experimentally observable, and that it is much\neasier to observe these singularities than the features of the tails of a stationary probability\ndistribution. The role of these tails and of large fluctuations in general is particularly\nimportant (Landauer 1975, 1978, 1988) for systems away from thermal equilibrium, as\nthere is no general principle that determines the fluctuation probabilities in such systems.\nIt is legitimate, therefore, to pose a question about general properties of fluctuation\ndynamics and patterns of optimal paths in non-equilibrium systems. One of the most\nimportant properties that we address here is the symmetry, with respect to time inversion,\nbetween optimal fluctuational paths and relaxational paths in the absence of fluctuations, and\nin what follows we limit the discussion to Markov systems. This symmetry is a feature of\nsystems in thermal equilibrium. The very occurrence of a fluctuational path which is a time-\ninversed relaxational path is a consequence of microscopic reversibility of closed systems,\nand in that sense is trivial, but here we are talking about the optimal paths. The time-\nreversal symmetry between optimal fluctuational and relaxational paths in linear Markov\nsystems was first shown by Onsager and Machlup (1953).\nThe paths symmetry in thermal Markov systems is a consequence of detailed balance\nand applies to various types of Markov systems, including dynamical ones (Ventcel\u2019 and\nFreidlin 1970, Graham and Te\u00b4l 1986, Dykman et al 1989, Maier and Stein 1993b) or\nsystems described by master equations (Hunt et al 1990, Ross et al 1992, Dykman et al\n1994c). The condition of detailed balance states that each individual transition in the system\nis balanced, i.e. the number of transitions x! x0 per unit time is equal to the number of\ntransitions x0 ! x (for states with continuous even variables x one should speak about\nthe densities of transitions, i.e. the relative number of transitions per infinitesimal \u2018volume\u2019\n28\ncentred at x). This condition always holds true in systems in thermal equilibrium (Landau\nand Lifshitz 1980), as there are no currents in such systems. It requires that the probabilities\nof elementary transitions w.x! x0\/ be balanced (cf Kac 1959, Graham 1973) so that the\nratio of the probabilities of forward and backward transitions between two states is equal to\nthe ratio of the probabilities of the transitions via an intermediate state. In other words, the\nratio of the probabilities of transitions back and forth is independent of the path (cf Dykman\net al 1994c).\nw.x! x0\/\nw.x0 ! x\/ D\nw.x! x1\/\nw.x1! x\/\nw.x1! x0\/\nw.x0 ! x1\/ : (41)\nIn particular, as applied to systems described by the Langevin equation (21) in the case\nof a time-independent force K.x\/, equation (41) holds if the integral R dxK.x\/ is\npath-independent, i.e. the force is gradient, K.x\/ D \u2212rU.x\/. The symmetry between\noptimal and relaxational paths in this case was discussed in section 3.2.1. We note that the\ncondition (41) on its own does not guarantee that there is detailed balance in the system, as\nthere still may be stationary solutions with current, as happens in the case of a Brownian\nparticle in a tilted washboard potential (Graham and Te\u00b4l 1986, Risken 1993).\nIn terms of the transition probability densities \u001a.xf ; tf j xi ; ti\/, the condition of detailed\nbalance for the stationary distribution \u001a.x\/ for a closed system in the absence of magnetic\nfield and rotation takes the form (Van Kampen 1990)\n\u001a.x2; t j x1; 0\/\u001a.x1\/ D \u001a.x1; t j x2; 0\/\u001a.x2\/ .t > 0\/: (42)\nSince for Markov systems the joint transition probability density factorizes into the\nprobability densities of individual transitions,\n\u001a.xf ; tf Ix; t j xi ; ti\/ D \u001a.xf ; tf j x; t\/\u001a.x; t j xi ; ti\/; tf > t > ti\nit follows from the definition of the prehistory probability density (20) and (42) that\nph.x; tIxf ; tf \/ D \u001a.xf ; tf j x; t\/\u001a.x; t j xi ; ti\/\n\u001a.xf ; tf j xi ; ti\/\nti!\u22121D \u001a.xf ; tf j x; t\/\u001a.x\/\n\u001a.xf \/\nD \u001a.x; jt \u2212 tf j j xf ; 0\/ t < tf (43)\n(Schulman 1991, Morillo et al 1997).\nEquations (43) show that, for Markov processes obeying detailed balance, the time\nevolution of the prehistory probability distribution is identical (Morillo et al 1997) to the\nevolution of the corresponding (i.e. measured for the same remote state (xf ; tf )) conditional\nprobability of the reciprocal transition (the relation of the prehistory probability distribution\nto the \u2018conventional\u2019 transition probability in systems with detailed balance, as well as\ntransient effects, were discussed by Vugmeister et al (1997)). Thus, one can investigate\nexperimentally the presence (or lack) of detailed balance for a given stochastic process by\nmeasuring the time evolution of both distributions.\nTo understand in more detail how an experiment on temporal asymmetry can be\nperformed let us consider a typical large fluctuation. As before (figure 4), a component x of\nsome dynamical variable x departs temporarily from the vicinity of the stable state, moves\nto a remote state xf and then returns. Extending our discussion in the previous section,\nhowever, we will now be interested not only in the outgoing (fluctuational) path away from\nthe attractor, but also in the relaxational path back to the attractor again. The variable x\nmight represent the voltage(s) in an electrical circuit (e.g. in an analogue experiment), or the\nphase of the order parameter in a SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device)\n(Kautz 1996) or in an optically bistable device (Dykman et al 1995a), or the number\ndensities of species in a chemical reaction (Dykman et al 1994f).\n  29\nAn important feature of Markov systems is that, once the optimal outburst of the random\nforce fopt.t\/ has brought the system to a given state xf , the random force immediately (over\nits correlation time, which is equal to zero for white noise) dies down to its mean-square\nroot value (Dykman 1990). Therefore, the system is then moving \u2018on its own\u2019, i.e. the\nsection of the trajectory after (xf ; tf ) should correspond just to the relaxational path\u2014the\npath the system would follow if it had been prepared in the state (xf ; tf ) and then let go,\nwith noise being weak.\nOptimal relaxational paths down to the stable state are the paths in the absence of noise.\nThey are also described by the Hamiltonian equations (26), with the solution\nPx DK.xI t\/ p D 0: (44)\nThe set of trajectories (44) approaching the stable state of the system and the corresponding\nfixed point x D xeq, p D 0 in phase space, forms the stable invariant manifold of this\nfixed point. We note that, in contrast to the relaxational paths (44), optimal fluctuational\npaths lie on the unstable invariant manifold of the same fixed point, as we discussed above,\nand for these paths the momentum p is not equal to zero. However, although the decay\nof fluctuations was well understood (Van Kampen 1990), whether or how the growth of\na fluctuation along the optimal path, which corresponds to the trajectory of the unstable\nmanifold, might be observed experimentally remained uncertain for a long time.\nThe results discussed above demonstrate, however, the physical reality both of the\noptimal fluctuational paths and of the singular features in their pattern: see also Dykman\net al (1992c, 1996a), Luchinsky (1997) and Luchinsky and McClintock (1997). Thus,\na direct experimental investigation of time symmetry properties of fluctuational motion\nbecomes possible with only a minor modification of the original experimental technique\n(see section 3.2.1). In the modified technique (Luchinsky 1997, Luchinsky and McClintock\n1997) the state of the system is monitored continuously until eventually, as shown in\nfigure 10(a), a large fluctuation reaches the voltage xf . But now the interesting region\nof the path includes not only the fluctuational part f coming from the stable state to\nxf , but also the relaxational part r leading back towards the stable state, and both\nparts of the path are stored. An ensemble average of the corresponding trajectories\n(figure 10(b)), built up over a period of time (typically weeks), creates the distribution\npf .x; t\/ \u0011 \u001a.xf ; tf Ix; t j xi ; ti\/=\u001a.xf ; tf j xi ; ti\/ which applies for t > tf as well as\nt < tf , and gives the probability density of the system being at x at time t (with t > tf or\nt < tf ) if it was at xf at time tf D 0 and xi \u0019 xeq at time ti !\u22121.\nWe now consider the application of these ideas to the fluctuations of three very different\nexample systems that can be used to describe a wide range of physical phenomena (Dykman\net al 1995d, Van Kampen 1990, Risken 1993, Haken 1975).\n3.3.1. Symmetry of fluctuations in equilibrium Markov systems. Our first example is the\noverdamped Duffing oscillator (31) already discussed above (section 3.2.1), modelling a\nbistable system in thermal equilibrium near one of its stable states. Figure 10(a) shows\na measured pf .x; t\/. It is evident that the relaxational and fluctuational parts of the\ndistribution are symmetrical, which would only be expected under conditions of detailed\nbalance. Indeed, one can rewrite equation (43) for the function pf .x; t\/ for t > 0 as\npf .x; t\/ D \u001a.x; t j xf ; 0\/\u001a.xf ; 0 j xi ; ti\/\n\u001a.xf ; 0 j xi ; ti\/ D \u001a.x; t j xf ; 0\/ t > 0: (45)\nThe aforementioned symmetry follows directly from comparison of equations (43) and (45).\n30\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 10. (a) The probability distribution pf .x; t\/ built up by ensemble averaging a sequence\nof trajectories like those in figure 4 for the thermal equilibrium system (31). The top plane\nplots the positions of the ridges of pf .x; t\/ for the fluctuational (open circles) and relaxational\n(asterisks) parts of the trajectory for comparison with theoretical predictions (curves) based on\n(26). (b) Direct comparison of the measured fluctuational (circles) and time-reversed relaxational\n(asterisks) ridges of the distribution in (a) with the theoretical prediction (full curve) from (26),\ndemonstrating the time-reversal symmetry of the two kinds of path (Luchinsky 1997).\nOne also sees from figure 10(a) that the ridges of the distribution follow closely the\ndeterministic trajectory found from (26), plotted as the full curve in figure 10(b). Hence, in\nthe macroscopic limit, where the width of the distribution tends to zero (because D ! 0)\nand one observes only the positions of the ridges, the paths to\/from xf themselves become\nsymmetric in time.\nAn immediate question arising from the Hamiltonian theory relates to the physical\nsignificance of the quantity p, which plays the role of a momentum in (26). This point\nis sometimes glossed over in the literature, with some authors describing p as a mere\n\u2018theoretical abstraction\u2019. However, as is clear from the way we derived the Hamiltonian\nequations (26), the momentum p.t\/ on the optimal path is directly proportional to the\n  31\noptimal force fopt.t\/ that drives the system to a given remote state (Dykman and Krivoglaz\n1979, 1984, Dykman 1990). Therefore, in our analogue experiment, p can be identified\nas the averaged value of the force driving the fluctuation, which is of course accessible\nto experimental measurement (as is also the case for the random force in Monte Carlo\nsimulations of stochastic processes). Thus, it becomes possible to perform direct tests of\nthe prediction of an optimal force.\nLuchinsky and McClintock (1997) have made simultaneous measurements of x.t\/ and\nof the corresponding trajectories of the random force f .t\/ in the analogue model of (31)\nduring transitions between the potential wells, i.e. setting xf D 0 on the local potential\nmaximum. Examples of actual trajectories (of the random force f .t\/) during escapes from\neach of the potential wells are shown as a function of the coordinate in the inset of figure 11,\nwhere they are compared to the theoretical escape paths obtained from equations (26) in\nthe phase space (x, p) of the auxiliary Hamiltonian system. A distribution was built up by\nensemble averaging a few hundred such trajectories, and the positions of the maxima of this\ndistribution are shown in figure 11 for comparison with the theoretical escape trajectories.\nWe emphasize that, in the limit of weak noise, such escape events are extremely rare.\nAlthough their statistics are consequently rather poor, the data clearly demonstrate: (i) that\nthe averaged value of the force driving the fluctuation follows closely the deterministic\ntrajectory corresponding to the optimal force; (ii) that p can be related to this optimal force;\n(iii) that, as anticipated, p 6D 0 during the fluctuational part of the path and p D 0 within\nexperimental error during the relaxational part; and (iv) that the Hamiltonian theory (curves)\ndescribes very well both parts of the fluctuation.\nFigure 11. Demonstration of time-asymmetric features of fluctuations in the thermal equilibrium\nsystem (31). The inset shows p.x\/ for two typical transitional paths from x D \u22121 to x D 1 (full\njagged line) and in the opposite direction (dotted jagged line). The main figure shows the paths\ntraced out by the ridges of the pf .p; x\/ distribution created from an ensemble average of such\ntransitions. The transitional path from x D \u22121 to x D 1 is shown by squares, and the reverse\ntransition by filled circles. The full and dashed curves are the corresponding paths predicted\nfrom (26) (Luchinsky and McClintock 1997).\n3.3.2. Asymmetry of fluctuations in non-equilibrium systems. Our second example is the\narchetypal non-equilibrium system (32) of section 3.2.2. This system does not obey the\ndetailed balance condition, and the ridges of the fluctuational and relaxational parts of\nthe measured pf .x; t\/ are found to differ markedly in shape (Luchinsky and McClintock\n1997). The paths that they trace out (data points), compared in figure 12(a) with theoretical\n32\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 12.

Continued.\nFigure 13. A block diagram of the analogue electronic circuit modelling the Maier and Stein\nsystem (46).\nreversing the relaxational trajectory. Figure 12(b) shows the measured pf .x; t\/ when xf\nis placed on the calculated switching line (Dykman et al 1994e; and see section 3.2.2),\na singularity separating regions that are approached via different fluctuational paths. The\nrelaxational tail leading back to the stable state xeq.t\/ is common to the two fluctuational\npaths that form the resultant corral (Dykman et al 1996a). From figure 12(c) we see that\nthe ridges of the distribution are strongly asymmetric in time, but agree well with the\nfluctuational and relaxational paths predicted from (26).\nOur third example (figure 13) is the system suggested by Maier and Stein (1993b, 1996a,\n1997) in their analysis of the escape problem in non-equilibrium systems. It describes the\nmotion of an overdamped particle in the two-dimensional drift field with the drift term of\n34\nthe form of K1.x1; x2\/ D .x1\u2212x31\u2212\u000bx1x22 ;\u2212x2\u2212x21x2\/, where \u000b is a parameter. It has point\nattractors at (\u00061; 0) and a saddle point at (0; 0). In describing the motion of the particle\nwe will use the variables x; y instead of x1; x2, as was done in the original work by Maier\nand Stein. If the particle is subject to additive isotropic white noise f.t\/ its position on\n(x; y)-plane will satisfy the coupled Langevin equations\nPx D x \u2212 x3 \u2212 \u000bxy2 C fx.t\/\nPy D \u2212y \u2212 x2y C fy.t\/ (46)\nhfi.t\/i D 0 hfi.s\/fj .t\/i D D\u000eij \u000e.s \u2212 t\/:\nSince K is not a gradient field (unless \u000b D 1), the dynamics will not satisfy detailed\nbalance.\nThe circuit model of (46) is of some interest, not least because it demonstrates the ease\nwith which the analogue technique may be applied to coupled equations. A block diagram\nis shown in figure 13: f 0x.t 0\/ and f 0y.t 0\/ are respectively the x and y components of the\nnoise voltage applied to the circuit, and t 0 is the real time.

(c) As in (b), but for the single remote\nstate xf D .0:32; 0\/ on the switching line (Luchinsky and McClintock 1997).\npaths become strikingly apparent. Figure 14(a) shows the measured probability distribution\nPf .x; y\/ for fluctuations to the two different remote states (xf ; yf ) placed symmetrically on\neither side of the y-axis; here, Pf .x; y\/ is the integral over the time t of the probability\ndistribution pf .x; y; tI xf ; yf ; tf \/, i.e. the projection of the distribution pf onto the x\u2013y\nplane with tf D 0 as before. When the paths traced out by the ridges are plotted\n(figure 14(b)), it can be seen: (i) that the fluctuational trajectories are completely different\n36\n(c)\nFigure 14. Continued.\nfrom the relaxational ones; and (ii) that they are in good agreement with the fluctuational\nand relaxational trajectories predicted from (26). Figure 14(c) shows the corresponding\npicture measured for fluctuations to a single remote state xf on the switching line (lying\non the x-axis, by symmetry arguments). The two fluctuational paths to the remote state\nare, again, markedly different from the common relaxational path leading back to the\nstable state (1; 0). Both parts of the trajectory are well described by the corresponding\noptimal paths calculated from (26). In this case too, therefore, the observations link a\nlack of detailed balance to the temporal asymmetry of fluctuational and relaxational paths,\nand demonstrate the non-differentiability (Graham and Te\u00b4l 1985) of the generalized non-\nequilibrium potential; the closed loops traversed during fluctuations verify the expected\n(Onsager 1931, Landau and Lifshitz 1980) occurrence of flows in the stationary state of\nnon-equilibrium systems.\n3.3.3. Singularities in the noisy exit problem and time symmetry-breaking. Analogue\nsimulations have proven to be very effective as a tool for the investigation of escape rates and\neffective activation energies of escape in systems lacking detailed balance. Some results\nare discussed below in sections 4.3.1 and 6.2, including the results on a fundamentally\nimportant (Gabrielse et al 1985, Dehmelt 1990) periodically-driven nonlinear oscillator,\nwhich was essentially the first model of a physical system without detailed balance where\nescape rates were calculated explicitly (Dykman and Krivoglaz 1979). Singularities in the\npattern of optimal paths of the driven oscillator were found numerically by Chinarov et al\n(1993), including the fact (later explained analytically (Dykman et al 1994e)) that caustics\nmay emanate from unstable stationary states in systems lacking detailed balance.\nHere we will present, in the context of an exit problem, recent results by Luchinsky\net al (1997) on the relationships between the onset of focusing singularities and nonanalytic\nbehaviour of an \u2018activation energy\u2019, broken time symmetry and lack of detailed balance,\nusing as an example the system (46) considered by Maier and Stein (1993a, b, 1996a, 1997).\nThis system is bistable, but because of the symmetry the escape rates are the same for each\nof the attractors (\u00061; 0). In the weak noise limit, the escape rate is then given by the lowest\nnon-zero eigenvalue \u00151 of the Fokker\u2013Planck operator which corresponds to the Langevin\nequations (46) (Risken 1993). For small D the eigenvalue \u00151 becomes exponentially small.\n  37\nIn this limit the mean first passage time (MFPT) htexiti is well approximated by \u0015\u221211 . We note\nthat the exponential slowness of the decay justifies application of the eikonal approximation\nand the prehistory formulation discussed above to the dynamics of large fluctuations about\nmetastable states.\nFor weak noise intensity, the escape from a domain of attraction typically follows a\nunique trajectory . This most probable escape path (MPEP) corresponds to the heteroclinic\nHamiltonian trajectory of the auxiliary system described by the equations (26). The\ntrajectory starts from the fixed point that corresponds to the attractor of the initial system\n(the point xeq D .\u00061; 0\/, p D 0 for the (46) system) and goes to the fixed point which\ncorresponds to the saddle point of the dynamical system (xs D 0, p D 0 in the case of (46)).\nIn the case of a time-independent Hamiltonian H , the motion occurs with zero energy.\nThe MPEP action \u000eW \u0011 S.xs\/ governs the weak noise behaviour of the MFPT. To\nleading order the MFPT is of the activation type, i.e.\nhtexiti \u0018 constant \u0002 e\u000eW=D D! 0: (51)\nSo \u000eW is interpreted as an activation energy of escape (Dykman and Krivoglaz 1979).\nIn the system (46), when \u000b D 1, the dynamics of the particle satisfy detailed balance,\nand the pattern of optimal trajectories emanating from .xeq, p D 0) contains no singularities.\nIt was found earlier (Maier and Stein 1993b, 1996a) that, as \u000b is increased, the first focusing\nsingularity on the MPEP (initially lying along the x-axis) appears when \u000b D \u000bc \u0011 4. It\nsignals the appearance of a transverse \u2018soft mode,\u2019 or instability, which causes the MPEP to\nbifurcate. Its physical origin is clear: as \u000b is increased, the drift toward the attractor (1; 0)\n\u2018softens\u2019 away from the x-axis, which eventually causes the on-axis MPEP to split. The\ntwo new MPEPs move off-axis, causing the activation energy (previously constant) to start\ndecreasing. So the activation energy as a function of \u000b is non-analytic at \u000b D \u000bc (Maier\nand Stein 1996a).\nTo test these theoretical predictions Luchinsky et al (1997) have investigated escape\nevents in an analogue electronic model of the system (46) (see figure 13). Transition\nprobabilities were measured by a standard level-crossing technique. Experimental\ninvestigations of the optimal fluctuational and relaxational trajectories were based on the\nexperimental technique described in the previous section. Luchinsky et al (1997) have also\ncarried out a complementary digital simulation of (46) using the algorithm of Mannella\n(1997).\nSome activation energy results are shown in figure 15. Part (a) plots the MFPT htexiti as\na function of inverse noise intensity 1=D for the special case \u000b D 1. In this case, the drift\nfield is the gradient of the potential U.x; y\/ D .y2.1 C x2\/ \u2212 x2 C x4=2\/=2, and \u000eW can\nbe obtained exactly (\u000eW D 2U ). The analogue and digital results are in good agreement,\nand demonstrate that the noise dependence of the MFPT is indeed of the activation type\npredicted by the theory (see also section 4.1 where the results for a different system lacking\ndetailed balance are discussed). Activation energies determined from the slopes of a series\nof plots like those in figure 15(a), yielded the results shown in figure 15(b), where they are\ncompared with theoretical values of \u000eW determined from the true (least action) MPEP or\nMPEPs (Maier and Stein 1993b, 1996a). At the predicted critical value \u000bc D 4, marked\nchanges in the activation energy are evident.\nTo verify experimentally the expected relationship between the bifurcation of the MPEP\nand the bifurcation of the activation energy, Luchinsky et al (1997) have measured 2D\nprehistory probability distributions of fluctuational trajectories bringing the system into\nthe vicinity of the separatrix between the two wells (the y-axis). In the limit of low\nnoise intensity, the maxima of the corresponding distributions trace out optimal trajectories.\n38\nFigure 15. (a) The mean first passage time as a function of inverse noise intensity 1=D for\n\u000b D 1, from analogue experiment (bars), numerical simulation (circles) and calculation (full\nline). (b) The inter-well activation barrier \u000eW , as a function of \u000b, from analogue experiment\n(crosses), numerical simulation (squares) and theory (full curve). The variation of the prefactor\nwith \u000b (circles and dotted curve) is discussed in the original paper (Luchinsky et al 1997).\nThe positions of these maxima are compared to the calculated MPEPs for \u000b D 6:67 in\nfigure 16(a). It is clear that the typical fluctuational path corresponding to escape from the\ndomain of attraction of (xs; 0) follows very closely one of the predicted MPEPs.\nTo seek further experimental insight into the character of the broken symmetry for the\nMPEP, Luchinsky et al (1997) have also followed the dynamics of the relaxational part of\nthe escape paths, after they have crossed the y-axis separatrix (in the general case, only\none side of the separatrix can be reached along optimal paths coming out of a given stable\nstate (Dykman et al 1994e)). The positions of the maxima of the measured relaxational\ndistributions are compared with the corresponding theoretical trajectories in figure 16(b). It\ncan be seen from the figure that for \u000b > \u000bc the MPEP breaks time-reversal symmetry in\nthe sense that the average growth and average decay of fluctuations (Onsager 1931) traced\nout by the ridges of the corresponding distributions take place along trajectories that are\nasymmetric in time. That is, for \u000b > \u000bc the MPEP is not a time-reversed relaxational\ntrajectory.\nThe inset in figure 16(b) shows the distribution of points where the escape trajectories\nhit the y-axis separatrix (i.e. the exit location distribution). Its shape is nearly Gaussian,\nas expected from the saddle-point approximation of Maier and Stein (1996a, 1997). The\nmaximum is situated near the saddle point clearly demonstrating that, in the limit of weak\nnoise, exit occurs via the saddle point\u2014a result which has been obtained independently by\nseveral groups (see Matkowsky and Schuss 1983, Freidlin and Wentzell 1984, Dykman and\nKrivoglaz 1984, Day 1987 and references in these papers; cf Maier and Stein 1996b).\n  39\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 16. Measured positions of the ridges (first moments) for \u000b D 6:67 of (a) the fluctuational\npart (full circles) and (b) the relaxational part (pluses) of the escape trajectories. Nearby\ntheoretical trajectories are shown by curves. The inset shows the exit location distribution\nalong the y-axis (Luchinsky et al 1997).\nWe note that, because of the symmetry y ! \u2212y of the Maier and Stein system (46),\nthe MPEP yopt D 0 can remain unchanged up to the value \u000bc D 4, whereas the system\nlacks detailed balance whenever \u000b 6D 1. Thus, for 1 < \u000b < 4 the dynamics of the most\nprobable fluctuational trajectories is a mirror image of the relaxational dynamics only along\nthe x-axis; everywhere else in the domain of attraction of (\u00061; 0) the outward optimal\ntrajectories are not antiparallel to the inward relaxational trajectories, and the resulting\nloops enclose non-zero area (Freidlin and Wentzel 1970).\nThis prediction has been tested experimentally (Luchinsky et al 1997) by tracing out\noptimal paths to\/from specified remote states both on and off the x-axis, for 1 < \u000b < \u000bc.\nSome results are shown in figure 17 for \u000b D 3:5. It is evident that the ridges of the\nfluctuational (full circles) and relaxational (pulses) distributions follow closely the theoretical\ncurves. For an off-axis remote state (figures 14(a) and (b), 17(a)), they form closed loops\nof non-zero area, thus demonstrating again the expected rotational flow of the probability\ncurrent in a non-equilibrium system (Onsager 1931).

Status of the experiments on large fluctuations\nThe results described above in this section, as well as those discussed in sections 4.1 and 6\nshow that, after so many years of investigating the probabilities of large fluctuations, it has\nnow become possible to use the prehistory formulation as a basis for experiments on the\nfluctuation dynamics . The work on Markov systems presented above has already verified\nseveral long-standing theoretical predictions, including the very observability of optimal\nfluctuational paths, narrowness of the tube of fluctuational paths, symmetry between the\ngrowth and decay of classical fluctuations in equilibrium Markov systems (Onsager 1931,\nOnsager and Machlup 1953, Landau and Lifshitz 1980), the breaking of this symmetry under\n  41\nnon-equilibrium conditions where systems lack detailed balance (Ventcel\u2019 and Freidlin 1970,\nDykman and Krivoglaz 1979, Jauslin 1987a b, Maier and Stein 1993a, 1997), the relationship\nof the lack of detailed balance to the onset of singularities in the pattern of optimal paths, as\nwell as the character of these singularities (Dykman et al 1994e, Maier and Stein 1996a, b,\nDykman et al 1996c, Smelyanskiy et al 1997a), including occurrence of switching between\noptimal paths and critical broadening of the paths distribution.\nIn fact, the very possibility of experimental observation of fluctuation dynamics was\ncrucial for stimulating theoretical interest, and in the last decade it has made fluctuation\ndynamics an active area of theoretical and experimental efforts, with many novel effects yet\nto be explored, and with various possible applications. We will mention further research\n(Luchinsky et al 1998) on the important problem of escape from a metastable state for the\nMaier and Stein system (46), investigations of the dispersion of the prehistory distribution\nand the conditions under which it is non-monotonic (Arrayas et al 1998a), studies of the\npossibility (Smelyanskiy and Dykman 1997, Vugmeister and Rabitz 1997) of highly effective\ncontrol of large fluctuations and work on how to control the rate and direction of diffusion\nin periodic systems (Arrayas et al 1997, 1998b).\n4. Stochastic resonance\nStochastic resonance (SR) has been much in the news recently, partly on account of\nits wide occurrence in many areas of science. In this section, we first present a very\nsuccinct introductory review of SR\u2014which, as already mentioned, was first measured\nexperimentally in an analogue electronic circuit (Fauve and Heslot 1983)\u2014and then describe\nhow subsequent electronic experiments have made major contributions to the development\nof a mature understanding of SR and of several related phenomena.\n4.1. What is stochastic resonance?\nStochastic resonance (SR) is commonly said to occur when a weak periodic signal in a\nnonlinear system is enhanced by an increase of the ambient noise intensity; a stronger\ndefinition requires that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) should also increase. The usual\nobservation is that the signal amplitude increases with increasing noise intensity, passes\nthrough a maximum and then decreases again. Thus, the general behaviour is somewhat\nsimilar to a conventional resonance curve, but the response is plotted as a function of\nnoise intensity instead of frequency. The SNR typically displays very similar behaviour\nexcept that it falls very rapidly before the onset of the counter-intuitive increase; in the case\nof systems with thresholds, or two-state systems (or where the signal from a continuous\nsystem is passed through a two-state filter prior to analysis), this initial decrease in the SNR\nis not seen. In the strongly nonlinear (large signal\/weak noise) regime, the variation of the\nresponse with noise intensity can be more complicated (see later).\nThe SR phenomenon appears to be widespread. After being introduced as a possible\nexplanation of the earth\u2019s ice-age cycle (Benzi et al 1981, Nicolis 1982), SR has\nsubsequently been observed or invoked in contexts that include lasers (McNamara et al\n1988, Vemuri and Roy 1989, Fioretti et al 1993, Iannelli et al 1994), passive optical\nsystems (Dykman et al 1991c, Grohs et al 1994, Jost and Saleh 1996, Vaudelle et al\n1998), tunnel diodes (Mantegna and Spagnolo 1994), a Brownian particle in an optical\ntrap (Simon and Libchaber 1992), a magnetoelastic ribbon (Spano et al 1992), crayfish\nand rat mechanoreceptors (Douglass et al 1993, Collins et al 1996), a bistable SQUID\n(superconducting quantum interference device) (Hibbs et al 1995), arrays of SR elements\n42\n(Lindner et al 1995), ion channels (Bezrukov and Vodyanoy 1995), magnetic systems\n(Grigorenko et al 1997), various types of electronic models (e.g. Fauve and Heslot\n1983, Gammaitoni et al 1989, Dykman et al 1990c, d, Anishchenko et al 1993, 1994),\nincluding models of coexisting periodic attractors (Dykman et al 1993b, 1996a), subcritical\nbifurcations (Vohra and Bucholtz 1993), systems with threshold (Gingl et al 1995),\nand transient dynamics (Iwaniszewski 1995), a quantum two-level system (Lofstedt and\nCoppersmith 1994), an array of coupled bistable systems (Morillo et al 1995, Bulsara and\nGammaitoni 1996), a system driven by quasimonochromatic (harmonic) noise (Neiman\nand Schimansky-Geier 1994), excitable neurons (Longtin 1995) and chemical systems\n(Leonard and Reichl 1994, Dykman et al 1995c). There have recently been two topical\nconferences (Moss et al 1993, Bulsara et al 1995), several general scientific articles\n(Wiesenfeld 1993, Moss and Xing Pei 1995, Moss and Wiesenfeld 1995, Bulsara and\nGammaitoni 1996) and topical reviews (Jung 1993, Moss 1994, Wiesenfeld and Moss\n1995, Dykman et al 1995d, e, 1996b, Gammaitoni et al 1998), including one (Dykman et al\n1995d) that specifically attempts to place SR in its scientific and historical context, and to\nconnect it to related phenomena in physics.\nIn bistable systems, the underlying mechanism of SR is easily appreciated, and in fact\nhas been known since the work by Debye (1929) on reorienting polar molecules. In a\nstatic double-well potential with equally-deep wells, the effect of an additive low-frequency\nperiodic force is to tilt the wells first in one direction, and then in the other, so that\none of the wells become deeper than the other, in turn. The effect of additive noise is, on\naverage, to induce fluctuational transitions to the deeper well. For very weak noise intensity,\nthere will on average be no transitions within a half cycle of the periodic force; for very\nstrong noise intensity the directions of transitions will be random, virtually unaffected by\nthe periodic force; and for an optimum noise intensity, the probability of such transitions\noccurring coherently twice (once in each direction) per full cycle of the periodic force will\nbe maximized. Thus noise can effectively amplify small coordinate variations within one\nof the potential wells, caused directly by the rocking effect of the periodic force, to an\namplitude corresponding to the coordinate separation of the potential minima\u2014which can\nbe made large, resulting in a correspondingly large susceptibility, and frequency dispersion\n(Debye 1929).\nSR was originally discussed (Benzi et al 1981, Nicolis 1982) for a bistable system and,\nin the following years, it was widely assumed that bistability was an essential prerequisite\nfor the phenomenon to occur. The description of SR as a linear response phenomenon\n(see section 4.2) led naturally, however, to the realization that SR can also occur without\nbistability (Stocks et al 1992) and to the observation of the phenomenon in an underdamped,\nmonostable, nonlinear oscillator (Stocks et al 1993c). In fact, it is well known that the\nresponse of a monostable system to signals in certain frequency ranges can be strongly\nincreased by noise, for example just by raising the temperature. Examples range from\ncurrents in electron tubes to optical absorption near absorption edges in semiconductors.\nFor underdamped oscillators, a temperature-induced shift and broadening of the absorption\npeaks, i.e. \u2018tuning\u2019 by external driving due to the oscillator nonlinearity, was first discussed\nby Ivanov et al (1966); complete classical and quantum theories of these effects were given\nby Dykman and Krivoglaz (1984).\nSome non-conventional forms of SR, including monostable SR, were reviewed by\nDykman et al (1993d). Since then, forms of SR without bistability have been identified in a\nsystem with a cyclic variable (Wiesenfeld et al 1994), a class of systems where the signal is\napplied as a multiplicative force (Vilar and Rubi 1996) and thresholdless systems (Bezrukov\nand Vodyanoy 1997). SR in a monostable SQUID model has recently been shown (Kaufman\n  43\net al 1996) to meet a fortiori even the stronger of the above definitions: the observed noise-\ninduced SNR enhancements were comparable both in magnitude and form with those of\nconventional SR. We consider monostable SR in more detail in section 4.3.2.\nThroughout the development of the subject area, analogue electronic experiments have\nplayed a major role. We have already cited a few of the key papers, and will refer to some\nmore of them below; for a fuller bibliography, reference should be made to the review\narticles on SR and the conference proceedings already mentioned.\n4.2. Stochastic resonance as a linear response phenomenon\nWhen it was first discovered, and for some time afterwards, SR seemed a rather mysterious\nphenomenon and a number of highly sophisticated theoretical approaches were proposed\n(see citations in, for example, the reviews by Jung 1993, Moss 1994, Wiesenfeld and Moss\n1995). Only some years later was it appreciated (Dykman et al 1990c, d, Gammaitoni\net al 1998) that a much simpler formalism\u2014linear response theory (LRT)\u2014would suffice\nto describe what was often the most interesting limit in practice, where the signal was\nrelatively small; an analytic theory of the more complicated effects that occur for stronger\nsignal strengths (Dykman et al 1990c, 1993f, Zhou et al 1990, Stocks 1995) has also\nbeen developed, and has been confirmed in considerable detail through analogue electronic\nexperiments. LRT has the particular advantage, however, that it places SR in perspective\nand enables it to be understood in the context of other more familiar phenomena in physics\n(Dykman et al 1995d). It therefore provides the best starting point for understanding SR.\nIf a system with a coordinate x is driven by a weak force A cost then, according to\nLRT (Landau and Lifshitz 1980), a small periodic term will appear in the ensemble-averaged\nvalue of the coordinate \u000ehx.t\/i, oscillating at the same frequency  and with amplitude a\nproportional to that of the force:\n\u000ehx.t\/i D a cos.t C \u001e\/ \u0011 Re[\u001f.\/A e\u2212it ] A! 0 (52)\na D Aj\u001f.\/j \u001e D \u2212arctan[Im\u001f.\/=Re\u001f.\/]:\nThis equation holds for dissipative and fluctuating systems that do not display persistent\nperiodic oscillations in the absence of the force A cost and where the correlations of\nfluctuations decay in time. The susceptibility \u001f.\/ contains all information on the response\nof the system to a weak driving force. It gives both the amplitude of the signal, a, and\nits phase lag \u001e with respect to the force (and the partial amplitudes and phase lags for\nvibrations at the combination frequencies). Equation (52) can be easily generalized to the\ncase where the force is of a more general nature than just an additive coordinate-independent\nforce described by an extra term \u2212Ax cost in the Hamiltonian. In particular, we consider\nbelow cases where the force is coordinate dependent (a multiplicative force), or where it is\nthe intensity of the noise driving the system (e.g. the temperature, if the noise is of thermal\norigin) that is modulated periodically. Provided that the amplitude of the modulation is\nweak enough, the response of the system will always be linear and described by (52).\nThe periodic term (52) induced by the force gives rise to a \u000e-shaped spike in the spectral\ndensity of fluctuations (SDF)\nQ.!\/ D lim\n\u001c!1.4\u0019\u001c\/\n\u22121\n\f\f\f\f Z \u001c\u2212\u001c dt x.t\/ exp.i!t\/\n\f\f\f\f2 (53)\nat the frequency  of the force. The intensity (i.e. the area) of this spike is equal to one\nfourth of the squared amplitude of the corresponding vibrations, i.e. to 14A\n2j\u001f.\/j2. The\n44\nsignal-to-noise ratio R can thus be written\nR D 14A2j\u001f.\/j2=Q.0\/.\/ .A! 0\/ (54)\nwhere Q.0\/.!\/ is the SDF in the absence of the periodic driving. The evolutions of the\nsusceptibility and of Q.0\/.!\/ with varying noise intensity D therefore show immediately\nwhether or not SR (in terms of the strong definition, as an increase in SNR with increasing\nD in a certain range of D) is to be expected at a given frequency.\nDescribing SR in terms of a susceptibility in this way is particularly advantageous\nfor systems that are in thermal equilibrium, or in quasi-equilibrium. In such cases the\nfluctuation\u2013dissipation relations (Landau and Lifshitz 1980) can be used to express the\nsusceptibility in terms of Q.0\/.!\/\nIm\u001f.!\/ D \u0019!\nD\nQ.0\/.!\/ Re\u001f.!\/ D 2\nD\nP\nZ 1\n0\nd!1Q.0\/.!1\/\n!21\n!21 \u2212 !2\n(55)\nwhere P denotes the Cauchy principal value and D corresponds to the temperature in\nenergy units. It follows from (54) and (55) that it should be possible to predict the onset\nof SR in a given system purely from the evolution of its SDF Q.0\/.!\/ with noise intensity\n(temperature), without knowing or assuming anything at all about the equations that describe\nits dynamics, i.e. for a system treated as a \u2018black box\u2019. The susceptibility can also be\nobtained by analytic solution of the Fokker\u2013Planck equation (Dykman et al 1993a), leading\nto an identical result.\nThese ideas were first tested (Dykman et al 1990c, d) through an analogue simulation\nof underdamped one-dimensional Brownian motion\nRx C 20 Px C @U\n@x\nD f .t\/C A cos.t\/ (56)\nhf .t\/i D 0 hf .t\/f .t 0\/i D 40D\u000e.t \u2212 t 0\/\nin the simple symmetric bistable potential (30). The circuit model was very similar to that\nof figure 2, except that the V2 term was not inverted before being fed back to point A.\nTwo different kinds of measurements were made on the system. First, SDFs were measured\nfor several values of D with the weak periodic force applied (A 6D 0), and the SNR was\ndetermined through measurements of the ratio of the height of the spike at  to that of\nthe noisy background (Fauve and Heslot 1983). These direct measurements of the SNR are\nshown as square data points in figure 18. Secondly, SDFs were measured in the absence of\nthe periodic force (A D 0) for several different noise intensities. These results were used to\ncompute the SNR to be expected on from the LRT relations (54) and (55) which are shown\nas \u2018pluses\u2019 in the figure. The agreement between the theory and the direct measurement is\nsatisfactory, within the scatter of the data. Given that there are no adjustable parameters,\nit may be considered an impressive vindication of the LRT approach to SR. Of course, the\nSDF Q.0\/.!\/ for insertion in (54) and (55) does not necessarily need to be measured, as\nhere. It can also be calculated analytically over a wide range of parameters (Dykman and\nKrivoglaz 1984, Dykman et al 1988, 1989).\nNote that the onset of SR in a bistable system can be understood in terms of the\nevolution with D of its SDF and, in particular, the broadening of the zero-frequency peak\n(Beasley et al 1983, Dykman et al 1988, 1989) associated with the interwell fluctuational\ntransitions. As the peak broadens Q.0\/.\/, for  finite but small, rises exponentially fast.\nThus from (55), it is clear that both Re\u001f.!\/ and Im\u001f.!\/ for ! D  will also increase\nexponentially fast. It is clear from (52) and (54) that a and R will also both increase with\nD. This perception of bistable SR is, of course, a counterpart of the picture of noise-\nenhanced hopping between the wells in response to the external driving, which was put\n  45\nFigure 18. A demonstration (Dykman et al 1990c) that stochastic resonance can be described in\nterms of linear response theory (LRT). The squares represent direct measurements of the scaled\nsignal-to-noise ratio NR for the system (30) and (56); the pluses represent LRT calculations based\non measured spectral densities and the use of (54) and (55).\nforward by Debye (1929). Clearly, the LRT approach is not limited to systems in a static\nbistable potential, or to bistable systems in general, for that matter. And indeed, as we will\nsee later, these ideas led directly to the prediction and observation of SR in monostable\nsystems.\nSurprisingly, perhaps, the obvious advantages of LRT in relation to SR\u2014its simplicity,\nbeauty and universality\u2014took some time to win general acceptance. So a supplementary test\nof the LRT picture was performed through direct measurements and calculations (Dykman\net al 1992b) of the phase shift \u001e between the periodic force and the system\u2019s response. The\nsystem chosen for study was the overdamped double-well Duffing oscillator, i.e. essentially\nthe same as (56) but with the inertial term missing\nPx C @U\n@x\nD f .t\/C A cos.t\/ (57)\nhf .t\/i D 0 hf .t\/f .t 0\/i D 2D\u000e.t \u2212 t 0\/\nwhere U.x\/ is again the quartic bistable potential (30). The circuit model used was similar\nto that of figure 5(a). The phase shift \u001e was determined by measuring ensemble averages\nhq.t\/i and comparing the resultant sinusoid directly with the weak periodic driving force\nA cos.t\/. Results are shown by the data points of figure 19. It can be seen that, as\nD is increased, \u2212\u001e starts from a very small value, rises extremely fast, passes through\na maximum and then decreases more slowly again. The prediction of earlier theories\n(Nicolis 1982, McNamara and Wiesenfeld 1989, Presilla et al 1989), based on the two-state\napproximation, is shown by the dashed curve. A theory able to describe the continuous\nsystem under consideration is readily constructed (Dykman et al 1992b) on the basis of LRT.\nIt leads to explicit expressions for the phase shift and SNR R that are valid for relatively\n46\nlow noise intensities and driving frequencies \n\u001e D \u2212arctan .=r\/.\n2\nrW C2D\/\nrW 2 C2D (58)\nR D \u0019A\n2\n4D2\n2rW\n2 C2D2\n2rW C2D\n;D \u001c r W \u001c D (59)\nwhere W is the inter-well transition probability in the absence of periodic forcing, and\nthe reciprocal relaxation time r D U 00.x D \u00061\/ D 2. For very small D, where\nW \u001c .2=2r \/D, it follows from (59) that R \u2019 \u0019A2=4D, \u001e \u2019 \u2212=r. Thus for a\nfixed forcing frequency , R decreases with increasing D, whereas \u001e remains small and\nnearly independent of D. For larger values of D, it is straightforward to demonstrate that\n(59) implies that R will pass through a minimum and then increase again (i.e. onset of the\nSR phenomenon) until D \u0018 1U=2, when the theory is no longer applicable (see the full\ncurve in the inset to figure 19) because the interwell transitions cease to be distinct events.\nWe would comment that the failure of the theory at large D occurs because the expressions\nused for Q.0\/.!\/ then become poor approximations; it is not a failure of LRT as such. We\nwould also comment that the LRT predictions of an initial fall in R with increasing D and\nof the existence of the minimum in R have been observed in many experiments, and were\nremarked upon and treated in an ad hoc fashion by McNamara and Wiesenfeld (1989) but\nhave not been accounted for quantitatively by any theory of SR other than LRT (Dykman\net al 1990c, d).\nFigure 19. The phase shift \u2212\u001e (degrees) between the periodic force of amplitude A and the\naveraged coordinate hx.t\/i measured (Dykman et al 1992b) as a function of noise intensity D\nin the electronic model of (30) and (57) for  D 0:1 and: A D 0:04 (circles); A D 0:2 (squares).\nThe full curve is a theoretical prediction based on LRT and the fluctuation dissipation theorem;\nthe dashed curve represents the prediction (60) of (two-state) theories (Nicolis 1982, McNamara\nand Wiesenfeld 1989, Presilla et al 1989) that make no explicit allowance for the effect of\nintra-well vibrations. The inset compares experiment and LRT prediction for the normalized\nsignal-to-noise ratio in the region of the minimum in R.\nIn agreement with equation (58), j\u001ej rises steeply from its D! 0 value, passes through\na maximum at D D Dmax < 1U , and then decreases again with further increase of D. For\nthe parameters used in the experiment, a maximum value of \u2212\u001e D 68\u000e is predicted to occur\nat Dmax D 0:08, which is to be compared with the experimental observation for A D 0:04\n  47\nof \u2212\u001e D .66\u00062\/\u000e at D D 0:08\u00060:01. In accordance with the LRT prediction, the decrease\nof j\u001ej for D > Dmax is much more gradual than the rapid increase seen below Dmax. The\nmeasured \u001e is relatively insensitive to A. The LRT prediction for the effect of noise on\nthe phase shift, based on the full set of equations for Q.0\/ (Dykman et al 1992b), which\ngoes beyond the range specified in (58), (59), is shown by the full curve in figure 19. It is\nevident that the analogue results are in excellent agreement with the theory. This form of\nbehaviour was also confirmed by Morillo and Go\u00b4mez-Ordo\u00b4n\u02dcez (1993) by numerical solution\nof the Fokker\u2013Planck equation.\nIt is reasonable to wonder why the variation of \u001e with D for SR in model (1)\nshould be non-monotonic (figure 19), whereas the corresponding variation of \u001e with \nin a deterministic resonance is well known to be monotonic, as also were the earlier\npredictions (Nicolis 1982, McNamara and Wiesenfeld 1989, Presilla et al 1989) for SR.\nAn answer is readily inferred by physical intuition. For very small D \u001c 1U , where the\nsystem is effectively confined to a single well, we may expect \u001e to be small because \nis small compared with the reciprocal characteristic time of intra-well motion\u2014for very\nlarge D \u001d 1U , where the double-well character of the potential has become irrelevant, we\nmay also expect \u001e \u2019 0, for the same reason\u2014so, at the intermediate values of D where\nSR occurs, any significant phase lag associated with the SR must inevitably give rise to a\nmaximum in j\u001ej, just as observed. Earlier theories failed to predict this behaviour because,\nunlike the theory described above, they are effectively two-state treatments that take no\naccount of the intra-well vibrations. This is easily shown (Dykman et al 1992b) because,\nif the intra-well vibrations are ignored, the expression for the phase shift (58) immediately\nreduces to the original Nicolis (1982) result\n\u001e D \u2212arctan.=W\/ (60)\nshown by the dashed curve in figure 19.\nObservation of the phase lags, as described here and by Gammaitoni et al (1991a, b),\nstrengthens the analogy between bistable SR and conventional forms of resonance. We\nwould stress, however, that it is only an analogy in the case of (57) because, although\na description of SR in terms of a residence time distribution enables some resonance-\nlike behaviour to be explored (Gammaitoni et al 1995), it remains true (Fox 1989) that\nthere is no matching of  to any internal vibrational frequency of the system. This is\nto be contrasted with SR in underdamped monostable systems (Stocks et al 1992, 1993c)\ndiscussed in section 4.3.2, which is a true resonance phenomenon where external noise is\nused to tune the natural oscillation frequency of the system to that of the periodic force.\nDigital simulations (Dykman et al 1993g) have shown that LRT also provides a\nsatisfactory description of the system behaviour even when  has become so large that\nthe SR effect has disappeared, and R just decreases monotonically with increasing D. LRT\nhas both advantages and disadvantages, as compared to other theoretical treatments. The\nmain disadvantage is that it will only yield quantitatively accurate results when A is small\nenough for the system to be within its regime of linear response; but this is, of course, a\ncondition that is often fulfilled in practice. It should be noted, however, that the quality of\nthe results obtained will naturally depend on the accuracy of the Q.0\/.!\/ used in (55) for\nthe calculation of \u001f.\/.\nWe now address the vexed question of whether an SR-displaying system (a \u2018stochastic\nresonator\u2019) can improve the SNR of a given signal. There has been much confusion on\nthis point in the literature, with more than one research group claiming that absolute SNR\nimprovements have been observed in experiments. However, Dykman et al (1995d) and\nDeWeese and Bialek (1995), using different LRT-based arguments, have pointed out that,\n48\nfor small-amplitude signals, the SNR at the output of a system driven by a stationary\nGaussian noise does not exceed that at the input, even if the system displays SR. Indeed,\nthe Fourier components of the noise are statistically independent and the total power of\nthe noise 4.\/ d in a small spectral interval d about the frequency of the signal  is\nsmall. The signal-to-noise ratio at the input is given by 14A\n2=4.\/, whereas that at the\noutput is 14 j\u001f.\/j2A2=[j\u001f.\/j24.\/ C Q0.0\/.\/]. The quantity Q0.0\/.\/ gives the value\nof the spectral density of fluctuations in the system at frequency  as it would be if there\nwas no signal and the spectral components of the noise at frequency  were suppressed,\ni.e. as if the power spectrum of the input noise had a hole at frequency . By construction\nQ0.0\/.\/ > 0, which proves the statement. (In linear systems, on the other hand, which\ndo not mix frequencies, Q0.0\/.\/ D 0 and the signal-to-noise ratio at the output must be\nthe same as at the input.) These points deserve, and have recently received (Dykman\nand McClintock 1998), emphasis, given the level of misinformation in some of the recent\nliterature on SR.\nThe situation with large-amplitude signals (beyond the LRT range) is less clear.\nGenerally, such signals are distorted by a nonlinear system: the response to a sinusoidal\nsignal has overtones, and therefore may not be characterized by the SNR at the signal\nfrequency. In some models the SR effect decreases with signal amplitude for large signals\n(Jung and Ha\u00a8nggi 1991), whereas for specific types of nonlinear signals and\/or definitions\nof the SNR, an increase of the SNR has been reported by Loerincz et al (1996) and by\nKhovanov and Anishchenko (1997).\n4.3. Non-conventional forms of stochastic resonance\nThe LRT picture led quickly to the realization that SR need not be restricted to systems of the\nkind that can be characterized by static bistable potentials, in which it had been discovered.\nOne consequence was, as already mentioned, the observation of SR in monostable systems\n(see section 4.3.2). Another was the observation of SR in bistable systems whose attractors\nare coexisting limit cycles (rather than the minima of a static potential) which we now\nconsider. As we shall see, the phenomenon can be discussed in terms of LRT although,\nsince the system now under consideration is of the non-equilibrium type, the susceptibility\ncannot be obtained through the fluctuation dissipation relations (55).\n4.3.1. Stochastic resonance for coexisting periodic attractors. The system considered by\nDykman et al (1993b, 1994c) was the underdamped single-well Duffing oscillator (8) and\n(9) driven by a nearly resonant force F cos!F t with the frequency !F close to the oscillator\neigenfrequency !0 such that\n0; j\u000e!j \u001c !F \u03b3 \u000e! > 0 \u000e! D !F \u2212 !0: (61)\nIt is of particular interest in view of its importance in nonlinear optics (Gibbs 1985,\nDrummond and Walls 1980, Flytzanis and Tang 1980, Goldstone and Garmire 1984) and\nits relevance to experiments on a confined relativistic electron excited by cyclotron resonant\nradiation (Gabrielse et al 1985, Dehmelt 1990). Provided that F 2 \u001c !40.\u000e!2 C 02\/=j\u03b3 j,\nand that the noise is weak, the resultant comparatively small amplitude .\u001c.!20=j\u03b3 j\/1=2\/\noscillations of x.t\/ can conveniently be discussed in terms of the dimensionless parameters\n(Dykman and Krivoglaz 1979)\n\u0011 D 0=j\u000e!j \f D 3j\u03b3 jF\n2\n32!3F .j\u000e!j\/3\n\u000b D 3j\u03b3 jD=8!3F0 (62)\n  49\nwhich characterize respectively the frequency detuning, the strength of the main periodic\nfield and the noise intensity. The bistability (Landau and Lifshitz 1976) in which we are\ninterested arises for a restricted range of \u0011 and \f, within the triangular region bounded by\nthe full lines of figure 20. Thus, as the amplitude of the periodic force is gradually increased\nfrom a small value at fixed frequency (see the vertical line a\u2013a0), the system moves from\nmonostability (one small-amplitude limit cycle), to bistability (two stable limit cycles of\ndifferent radii) and then back again to monostability (one large-radius limit cycle). The\neffect of weak noise f .t\/ is to cause small vibrations about the attractors, and to induce\noccasional transitions between them when the system is within the bistable regime. Since\nthe system is far away from thermal equilibrium, the transition probabilities are not given\nby the classical Kramers (1940) theory. As mentioned above, the nearly resonantly driven\noscillator was the first physical system without detailed balance where escape rates were\nexplicitly calculated (Dykman and Krivoglaz 1979). The inter-attractor transitions give rise\nto a stationary distribution of the oscillator over the attractors. They also give rise to an\nSR effect which, as we shall see, occurs in the close vicinity of the kinetic phase transition\n(KPT) line (Dykman and Krivoglaz 1979, Dykman et al 1990e), represented by a dashed\ncurve in figure 20, where the stationary populations of the two attractors w1 and w2 are\nequal,\nw1 \u0019 w2: (63)\nFigure 20. The phase diagram for the system (8) and (61) in terms of reduced parameters (62):\nthe cuts a\u2013a0 and p0\u2013p\u2013p00 are discussed in the text (Dykman et al 1993b).\nOur principal aim is to consider the response of the system (8) to an additional weak trial\nforce A cos.t C \u001e\/. In stationary conditions, the response to this field in the presence of\nthe strong driving field can still be described, in terms of LRT, by a susceptibility. The trial\nforce beats with the main periodic force and thus gives rise to vibrations of the system, not\nonly at , but also at the combination frequencies j\u00062n!F j (and also at j\u0006.2nC1\/!F j\nin the case of nonlinearity of a general type). We are interested in the case where the strong\nand trial forces are both nearly resonant: that is, !F and  both lie close to the oscillator\neigenfrequency !0. This is the case for which the response to the trial force is strongest.\nIt is at its most pronounced at frequency  and at the nearest resonant combination, which\nfor (8) is j \u2212 2!F j. The amplitudes of vibrations at these frequencies can be described\nrespectively by susceptibilities \u001f.\/ and X.\/, so that trial-force-induced modification of\n50\nthe coordinate x, averaged over noise, can be sought in the form\n\u000ehx.t\/i D ARef\u001f.\/ exp[\u2212it \u2212 i\u001e]CX.\/ exp[i.2!F \u2212\/t]\u2212 i\u001e]g: (64)\nWithin the KPT range, jIm\u001f.\/j displays a high narrow peak, whose width is given by the\ntransition rates and is therefore strongly noise dependent (Dykman and Krivoglaz 1979).\nThe rapid rise in susceptibility with noise intensity corresponds precisely to SR because,\naccording to (64), the areas of the peaks in the power spectrum at frequencies  and\nj\u2212 2!F j are\nS.\/ D 14A2j\u001f.\/j2 S.j\u2212 2!F j\/ D 14A2jX.\/j2: (65)\nAn intuitive understanding of the predicted mechanism of stochastic amplification (Dykman\nand Krivoglaz 1984) can be gained by noting that the trial force modulates the driving\nforce (and the coordinate x.t\/) at frequency j \u2212 !F j and that, when j \u2212 !F j is small\ncompared to the dynamical relaxation rate 0, the dynamic response of the system is almost\nadiabatic. In terms of the phase diagram figure 20, the beat envelope then results (Dykman\net al 1993b) in a slow vertical oscillation of the operating point. If the operating point is\ntaken to be p, and its range of modulation p0\u2013p00 is set to straddle the KPT line as shown,\nthen the role of the field A cos.t C \u001e\/ is precisely the same as the role of the field in the\ncase of a static potential: it alternately biases one of the stable states (a periodic attractor,\nin the present case) with respect to the other, i.e. it strongly modulates populations of the\nattractors (in the quasistatic limit). Note that this modulation does not occur away from the\nKPT line, where the populations are always very different.\nIf the noise intensity is optimally chosen, then the modulated system will have a tendency\nto make inter-attractor transitions coherently , once per half-cycle of the beat frequency. The\nnet effect of the noise is, therefore, to increase the modulation depth of the beat envelope\nof the response, thereby increasing the components of the signal at frequencies  and\nj\u2212 2!F j.\nExperimentally, the response of the system (8), (9) and (62), and the variation of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio with \u000b, were investigated (Dykman et al 1993b, 1994c) by use of the\nelectronic model described in section 2.1. In terms of scaled units the circuit parameters\nwere set, typically, to: 20 D 0:0397, !0 D 1:00, \u03b3 D 0:1, !F D 1:072 00,  D 1:070 97\nand, to seek SR near the KPT, F D 0:068 and the amplitude of the trial force A D 0:006.\nA spectral density of fluctuations of the coordinate x.t\/ (about hx.t\/i for A D 0) recorded\nwith the above parameter values for \u000b D 0:061 and 16 384 samples in each realization, is\nshown in figure 21. The smooth background is the supernarrow spectral peak of Dykman\net al (1990e), which is due to fluctuational transitions between the attractors and has a\nmaximum at the field frequency !F ; its width is given by the transition probabilities and\nremains very much smaller than 20. The delta function spikes, indicated by raised points\nof the discrete spectrum, are clearly visible, not only at the trial force frequency (), but\nalso as predicted at the mirror-reflected frequency (2!F \u2212). Note that the value of , the\nnumber of points in each x.t\/ realization and the sample interval were chosen to be such\nthat the signals at  and (2!F \u2212 ) each fell within individual bins of the discrete SDF,\nand such that there were several bins in between them.\nThe signal-to-noise ratios R, determined in the usual way from measurements of the\ndelta spikes and the smooth background, are plotted (data points) as functions of noise\nintensity \u000b in figure 22 for \f D 0:814, \u0011 D 0:236. It is immediately evident that there\nis a range of \u000b within which R increases with \u000b. It is also apparent that, for both the\nmain and the mirror-reflected signals, the form of R.\u000b\/ in figure 22 is remarkably similar\nto that observed for conventional SR. That is, R initially decreases with \u000b, on account of\n  51\nFigure 21. The power spectral density Q.!\/ measured (Dykman et al 1993b) for the electronic\nmodel of (8), (9) and (61), with the contents of each FFT memory address shown as a separate\ndata point on a highly expanded abscissa; a smooth curve, peaking at !F , is drawn through the\nbackground spectrum; vertical lines indicate the delta spikes resulting from the trial force.\nFigure 22.

For noise intensities near those of the maxima\nin R.\u000b\/, the asymptotic theory is only qualitative and so the curves are dotted.\nthe increase in its denominator. With further increase of \u000b, the inter-attractor transitions\ncome into play and can be effectively synchronized by the trial force, giving rise to an\nincrease in R through the stochastic amplification mechanism discussed above. Finally, for\nstill larger \u000b, R decreases again partly owing to the continuing rise in its denominator and\npartly because transitions are then occurring very frequently, within individual periods of\nthe trial force, with a corresponding reduction in the proportion of the phase-coherent jumps\nthat are responsible for the amplification.\nA quantitative theory of the phenomenon is readily constructed through an extension\n(Dykman et al 1989, 1994c) of the formalism introduced by Dykman and Krivoglaz (1979).\nIt leads to contributions to the susceptibilities from inter-attractor transitions of the form\n\u001ftr.\/ D w1w22!F .!F \u2212 !0\/ .u\n\u0003\n1 \u2212 u\u00032\/\n\u00161 \u2212 \u00162\n\u000b\n\u0014\n1\u2212 i.\u2212 !F \/\nW12 CW21\n\u0015\u22121\n(66)\n52 or in other words \nXtr.\/ D u1 \u2212 u2\nu\u00031 \u2212 u\u00032\n\u001ftr.\/ \u0016j D\np\n\f\n\u0012\n@Rj\n@\f\n\u0013\nwhere w1 and w2 are the populations of the attractors 1 and 2, and W12 and W21 are\nthe probabilities of transitions between them, which are of the activation type Wij \/\nexp.\u2212Ri=\u000b\/. (ui and u\u0003i , which define the positions of the attractors in the rotating\ncoordinate frame, can be regarded as constants for given \u0011, \f; and \u0016i determine how\nfast the activation energies vary with the reduced squared field amplitude \f \/ F 2.) It is\nevident that the contributions (66) come into play if, and only if, the system is within the\nKPT range where the populations of the unperturbed attractors are comparable; otherwise,\nthe factor w1w2 \/ exp.\u2212jR1 \u2212R2j=\u000b\/ will be exponentially small. Within the KPT range,\nhowever, the susceptibilities will be large because they are proportional to the large factor\nj\u00161 \u2212 \u00162j=\u000b; the rapid increase of Wij with noise intensity then ensures that there will be\na range of \u000b in which both susceptibilities increase very rapidly with \u000b, consistent with\nthe experiments. The full theory (Dykman et al 1994c) includes the effect of intra-attractor\nvibrations and leads to the curves of figure 22. Given the large systematic errors inherent\nin the measurements\u2014arising, for example, from \u000e! (61), a small difference between large\nquantities which, in \f (62), is then raised to its third power\u2014the agreement between theory\nand experiment can be considered excellent.\nWe emphasize that, in contrast to conventional bistable SR (see previously and Jung\n1993, Moss 1994, Wiesenfeld and Moss 1995 and Dykman et al 1995d), stochastic\namplification occurs here not at the relatively low frequency of the nearly periodic inter-\nattractor hopping but, rather, at  close to the much higher (tunable) frequency !F of the\nmain periodic driving force. To emphasize the distinction, it seemed appropriate (Dykman\net al 1993b, 1994c) to refer to the new form of SR as high-frequency stochastic resonance\n(HFSR).\nThere is an interesting connection between HFSR and four-wave mixing in nonlinear\noptics (Shen 1984). In effect, the results correspond to noise-enhanced amplification of the\nsignal wave, and noise-enhanced generation of the idler wave. The mechanisms are resonant\nand, although they have the appearance of four-wave mixing, they actually correspond to\nmultiple-wave processes: in terms of quantum optics, the oscillator absorbs and re-emits\nmany quanta of the strong field. The very high amplification\/generation coefficients arise\npartly from their resonant character and partly from the fact that the signal sizes correspond,\nnot to the amplitudes of vibrations about the attractors but, as usual in bistable SR, to the\n\u2018distance\u2019 between the attractors (to their coordinate separation for conventional SR, and\napproximately to their difference in amplitude in the present case).\nThe prediction and demonstration of HFSR for periodic attractors, and its similarity\n(figure 22) to conventional SR, led to a broader and more general perception of the physical\nnature of bistable SR. Like the onset of supernarrow peaks in the power spectra, conventional\nSR and HFSR are both critical phenomena that arise in the range of the KPT. While HFSR\nis to be anticipated for coexisting stable limit cycles with equal periods, low-frequency SR\nis a more robust effect. It arises, not only for systems fluctuating in simple double-well\npotentials but also for systems where one (or both) of the attractors is chaotic (Anishchenko\net al 1993, 1994); it follows from the analysis by Dykman and Krivoglaz (1979) that low-\nfrequency SR is also to be anticipated for periodic attractors, provided the oscillator lacks\ninversion symmetry, so that the centres of the coexisting periodic attractors have different\nlocations. Since noise gives rise to fluctuational hopping between any types of attractors, SR\nis actually a phenomenon characteristic of all systems with coexisting attractors, regardless\nof the nature of those attractors, provided only that the system lies within its KPT range (63).\n  53\n4.3.2. Stochastic resonance in monostable systems. As already remarked above, the LRT\nperception of SR embodied in equations (52), (54) and (55) immediately implies that SR\ncan be anticipated quite generally in systems which, within a certain frequency range,\nexhibit a sharp increase of the susceptibility \u001f.!\/ with increasing intensity D of the driving\nGaussian noise. The effect may be expected to be particularly strong if the response is\nresonant, as is the case for a noise-driven underdamped nonlinear oscillators (Dykman\nand Krivoglaz 1984). Because of nonlinearity, the frequency of the oscillator vibrations\n!.E\/ depends on the energy E (measured from the bottom of the potential well). Because\nof the noise, the oscillator has a distribution over energy (the Boltzmann distribution, in\nthe case of systems in thermal equilibrium). Therefore, it also has a distribution over\nvibrational frequency. With increasing noise intensity this distribution changes and, in\nparticular, vibrations can be excited with frequencies that were effectively unavailable for\nsmaller noise intensity. Consequently, the response at such frequencies can be strongly\nenhanced by noise.\nThe resonant susceptibility of nonlinear oscillators has been analysed in detail\ntheoretically, as this is one of only a few exactly solvable nonlinear problems (Dykman and\nKrivoglaz 1984). Explicit analytical results have been obtained for an arbitrary ratio between\nthe relaxation rate and the noise-induced frequency straggling (Dykman and Krivoglaz\n1971), and a general numerical algorithm has been formulated for calculating the shape of\nthe power spectrum near its maximum (Dykman et al 1989). In particular, the sharp change\nof the power spectrum of the oscillator, including its exponential increase with increasing\nnoise intensity, was discussed in the above papers. The appearance of an additional zero-\ndispersion spectral peak (ZDP), in cases where the damping is extremely small and the\noscillator frequency !.E\/ is non-monotonic as a function of energy, was predicted and\ndiscussed by Soskin (1989, 1992).\nThe model used (Stocks et al 1992) to predict and observe SR in monostable systems\nand investigate its characteristic features is the tilted single-well Duffing oscillator driven\nby Gaussian white noise plus a weak periodic force\nRx C 20 Px C dU.x\/\ndx\nD f .t\/C A cost\nU.x\/ D 1\n2\nx2 C 1\n4\nx4 C Bx (67)\n0 \u001c 1 hf .t\/i D 0 hf .t\/f .t 0\/i D 40D\u000e.t \u2212 t 0\/:\nIt is effectively identical to the symmetrical single-well Duffing oscillator (8) except for the\nBx term in the potential. We consider two distinct cases, depending on the magnitude of\njBj.\nIn case (a), where jBj < 8=.7\/3=2 \u0019 0:43, the variation of the oscillator\u2019s eigenfrequency\n!.E\/ with energy E measured from the bottom of the potential well is monotonic (Dykman\net al 1990b), as sketched in figure 23(a). In the absence of the periodic force (A D 0),\nfor small noise intensity D, a narrow Lorentzian peak of width \u00180 occurs in the SDF\nat frequency !.0\/. As D is increased, the peak broadens asymmetrically (Dykman and\nKrivoglaz 1971) towards higher frequencies, as discussed earlier. For an  > !.0\/, initially\non the tail of the peak, i.e. .\u2212 !.0\/\/ > 0, the magnitude of Q.0\/.\/ therefore increases\nextremely rapidly (Dykman and Krivoglaz 1971) with D, as does also the generalized\nsusceptibility \u001f.\/. One would expect, therefore, to observe SR in this case even though the\nsystem is monostable, with U.x\/ a smooth single-well potential. The resonance maximum\nis to be expected when D has been \u2018tuned\u2019 to adjust the characteristic energy QE \u0018 D such\nthat !. NE\/ \u0018 .\n54\nFigure 23.

In the absence of the periodic force (A D 0), the\nsystem exhibits noise-induced spectral narrowing (Dykman et al 1990b); and, for sufficiently\nsmall values of the damping constant 0, exceedingly sharp ZDPs of width \/01=2 appear\n(Soskin 1989, 1992) close to the frequency !m of the extremum where d!.E\/=dE D 0\n(respectively, E D Em). A set of power spectra Q.0\/.!\/ showing the evolution of the ZDP\nwith increasing D, measured in an analogue electronic experiment (Stocks et al 1993c), is\nshown in figure 24. The magnitude of the ZDP rises exponentially with increasing D. Just\nas in case (a) the corresponding rapid increase of \u001f.\/ implies a manifestation of SR for\n close to !m. Since the ZDP arises only when vibrations of energy \u0018Em are excited, the\nintensity of the ZDP displays an activation dependence on noise intensity. This suggests\nthat the SR effect in case (b) may be very pronounced. Case (a) is, of course, the more\ngeneric, as it applies to any underdamped system (Dykman and Krivoglaz 1984), and here\ntoo the SR effect can be quite pronounced (Dykman et al 1996a). Note, however, that\nsystems with one or more zero-dispersion points, as in figure 22(b), are not uncommon: see\nsection 7.2.\nTo test these predictions, evidence was sought (Stocks et al 1993c) of SR in an electronic\nmodel of (67); it was very similar to that shown in figure 2, except that an additional constant\nvoltage representing the asymmetry term B in (67) was added at point A. The parameter\nvalues used were 0 D 0:011, A D 0:020 and B D 0 or B D 2:00 for cases (a) or (b),\nrespectively. The value of 0 was again too small to be determined reliably from the circuit\ncomponents (owing to the effect of stray capacitance and other non-idealities); instead, it\nwas measured in a separate experiment. The model was driven with quasi-white noise from\nan external noise generator, and with a weak periodic force from an HP3325 frequency\nsynthesizer. The resultant fluctuating x.t\/ was digitized in 1024 point blocks and ensemble\naveraged by a Nicolet LAB80 data processor to yield hx.t\/i. By averaging in the time\n(rather than the frequency) domain, as discussed in section 4.2, it was possible to make\nmeasurements of the phase shift \u001e between the drive and the response (Gammaitoni et al\n1991a, Dykman et al 1990c, d, 1992b) as well as yielding directly the amplitude a of the\n  55\nFigure 24.

Measurements were made of the stochastic amplification factor (Jung and Ha\u00a8nggi\n1991)\nS.D\/ D a.D\/=a.0\/ (68)\nand of the corresponding value of \u001e over a wide range of D for the two cases (a) and (b).\nSome typical measurements of the noise-induced power gain are shown by the data\npoints in figure 25 (where S2 is plotted rather than S for more convenient comparison\nwith earlier SR results). It is immediately evident that, both for case (a) (squares) and for\ncase (b) (circles), S2 at first increases rapidly with noise intensity, but then passes through\na maximum and decreases again, albeit more slowly. That these data should bear a striking\nresemblance to those obtained for conventional SR (Jung 1993, Moss 1994, Wiesenfeld and\nMoss 1995, Dykman et al 1995d) is, of course, no coincidence. Note that, in the case of\n56\nFigure 25. The squared stochastic amplification factor S2 measured (Stocks et al 1993c) for\ncase (a) (squares) and case (b) (circles) as a function of noise intensity D for the electronic\ncircuit model of (67) with A D 0:02 is compared with the theoretical predictions (full curves)\nobtained from the fluctuation dissipation theorem.\nFigure 26.

As anticipated, the maximum is much larger for\ncase (b) than for case (a); it can be shown (Stocks et al 1992) that, in case (b) for sufficiently\nsmall 0, not only the signal but also the SNR increases with increasing D within a certain\nrange. We note, however, that as always in SR this increase is achieved at the expense of\nvery poor signal transduction for small noise intensity.\nThe measured phase lag \u2212\u001e between the drive and response is plotted for case (a)\n(squares) and case (b) (circles) in figure 26. The forms of \u2212\u001e.D\/ for the two cases\nare strikingly different, but they can readily be understood qualitatively by analogy with\na conventional (deterministic) resonance. In case (a) for D D 0, the periodic driving\n57\nforce is being applied at a frequency well beyond the natural frequency of the system,\n > !.0\/ (see figure 23(a)). Consequently \u2212\u001e is close to 180\u000e. As D is increased,\nhowever, the \u2018natural frequency\u2019 !.E\/ is effectively being tuned past the fixed driving\nfrequency. Near resonance \u2212\u001e passes through 90\u000e and, in the high D limit where the\n\u2018natural frequency\u2019 substantially exceeds , \u2212\u001e decreases towards 0\u000e exactly as would\nbe seen in a conventional resonance. The phase changes for case (b), while quite\ndifferent, can be accounted for in a very similar way. In this case, the \u2018natural frequency\u2019\n!.E\/ always exceeds that of the drive  (figure 23(b)), and so the phase lag \u2212\u001e is\nalways less than 90\u000e, although it approaches 90\u000e near the resonance maximum, just as\nexpected.\nA quantitative theoretical description of these phenomena is readily developed using the\nLRT relations. The squared amplitude of the response is just a2 D A2j\u001f.\/j2, so that\nS2 D [a.D\/=a.0\/]2 D j\u001f.\/j2f[!.0\/2 \u22122]2 C 4022g: (69)\nThe quantity Q.0\/.!\/ in (55), the SDF in the absence of the periodic force, was obtained\nfrom equation (20) of Dykman et al (1990b) (which specifies for the model (67) the general\nexpressions of Dykman and Krivoglaz (1984)) also using their equations (4a), 4(b), (14),\n(A7), (A9) and a numerical solution of their (16). Values of S2 and \u001e calculated in this\nway for (67) with the parameters used in the circuit are plotted (full curves) as functions\nof D in figures 25 and 26 for comparison with the experimental measurements. Given that\nthere are no adjustable parameters, the agreement between experiment and theory can be\nregarded as excellent.\nA closely related effect, in which a noise-induced increase occurred in the resonant\nresponse of an underdamped nonlinear oscillator, was investigated by Dykman et al (1996a)\nfor the case of subharmonic \u2018two-photon\u2019 absorption. The oscillator was excited at nearly\nhalf its eigenfrequency and, here too, noise was used to tune the system to resonance,\nresulting in large changes in the susceptibilities. Formally, the response to the driving is\nnonlinear but, in the approximation where only resonant effects are taken into account, the\ntheory can effectively be reduced to a quasilinear one. Sharp and very strong increases\nof the appropriate nonlinear susceptibility with increasing noise intensity were observed\nin the ranges where the frequency of the field  was close to one half of the oscillator\neigenfrequency !0, or to one half of the zero-dispersion frequency !e.\nAlthough the results of figure 25 show dramatic noise-induced signal enhancements\nthey do not, even for case (b), quite satisfy the stronger definition of SR (increase of the\nSNR) mentioned earlier; a smaller value of 0 would have been needed (Stocks et al 1992)\nfor this to be so. It was pointed out by Soskin (private communication), however, that\nmuch stronger SR effects were to be anticipated in underdamped SQUIDs (superconducting\nquantum interference devices), even for relatively large values of 0. His hypothesis was\ntested (Kaufman et al 1996) by experiments on an analogue electronic model of a SQUID.\nThe dynamics of the magnetic flux through a periodically-driven SQUID loop can\nbe described in terms of a resistively shunted model (Barone and Paterno 1982) whose\ngoverning equation, after appropriate changes of variable (see, e.g., Kaufman et al 1996)\ncan be written\nRx C 20 Px C dU\ndx\nD f .t\/C A cos.t\/\nU.x\/ D 1\n2\nB.x \u2212 xdc\/2 \u2212 cos x (70)\nhf .t\/i D 0 hf .t\/ f .t 0\/i D 40D\u000e.t \u2212 t 0\/\n58\ncorresponding to classical motion in the potential U.x\/ under influence of the additive noise\nf .t\/. We consider the case where the amplitude A of the periodic force is small, where\nthe constant 0 is also small so that motion in the potential is underdamped and where the\nrelative magnitudes of B and xdc are such that the potential has a single potential well.\nThe corresponding !.E\/ dependence calculated for the SQUID potential (70) with\nB D 0:3 and xdc D 0, shown in figure 27, exhibits a local maximum and two local\nminima within the range plotted. Each of these extrema may be expected to produce a\nZDP in Q.0\/.!\/ that could in principle give rise to SR. To test this inference, Kaufman\net al (1996) built an analogue electronic model of equations (70), as shown in block form\nin figure 28. A0 cos0t 0 and f 0.t 0\/ are respectively a signal and an external noise applied\nto the underdamped nonlinear oscillator.

The three ZDPs appeared sequentially as D \u2018tuned\u2019\nthe oscillator to different ranges of !.E\/. When the weak periodic force A cos.t\/ was\nalso added, with  chosen to lie close to the frequency of the local maximum of !.E\/ and\nthe corresponding ZDP where j\u001f j is expected to be strongly noise dependent, the SNR was\nfound to vary with increasing D as shown by the data points of figure 30. At first the SNR\nfalls, as one might expect on intuitive grounds, but there follows a range of D within which\nthe SNR markedly increases with increasing D, i.e. a strong manifestation of SR, before\nfalling again at very high D.\nFigure 29. The spectral density of fluctuations Q.!\/ measured (jagged curve) for the analogue\nelectronic model of equations (70) with A D 0, B D 0:3, xdc D 0, compared with the calculated\nbehaviour (smooth curves), for three noise intensities D (Kaufman et al 1997). One ZDP is\nseen for D D 1:0, and three for D D 3:1. Note the differing ordinate scales.\nThe theory of these phenomena has been developed (Kaufman et al 1996, 1997) on the\nusual LRT basis: first, the power spectral densities Q.0\/.!\/ in the absence of the periodic\nforce were calculated for different values of D, by means of an algorithm similar to that\ndescribed previously (Dykman et al 1989, 1990b); second, the calculated Q.0\/.!\/ was\ninserted in equations (54) and (55) to yield the SNR, as required. The theory, shown by\nthe full curves of figures 29 and 30, is in satisfactory agreement with the measurements.\nIt demonstrates that the size of the increase in SNR is related to the magnitude of 0 and\n  61\nFigure 30. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measured (data points) as a function of noise intensity\nD for the analogue electronic model of equations (70) with A D 0:016,  D 0:62, B D 0:3,\nxdc D 0, compared with the behaviour predicted (full curve) by LRT, equations (54) and (55),\nusing the calculated spectral densities Q.!\/ of which three examples are plotted as dashed lines\nin figure 29 (Kaufman et al 1997).\nthat, if 0 is made small enough, there is in principle no limit to the rise in SNR that can be\nachieved. Note also that the above SQUID parameters, used by Kaufman et al (1996), were\nchosen so as to provide a monostable potential mainly in order to emphasize the marked\ndifference between zero-dispersion SR and conventional SR; but zero-dispersion SR also\noccurs in SQUIDs with multi-well potentials (Kaufman et al 1997) where it exhibits some\ninteresting features.\nIn the light of these results from the analogue electronic model, we may conclude that\nzero-dispersion SR is to be anticipated in underdamped SQUIDs. The optimal frequencies\nfor the SR, i.e. the ZDP frequencies, are tunable over a very wide range\u2014in principle,\nrunning from near zero up to a maximum value not much less than the Josephson plasma\nfrequency\u2014by adjustment of the applied static magnetic field and\/or the inductance of the\nloop. Although the SNR at the output of an SR (or any other) device cannot exceed that at\nthe input (see section 4.2), noise can still be used to improve the output SNR of signals for\na specific nonlinear device, as in the present case. The performance of a high-frequency\nSR device based on an underdamped SQUID would probably be comparable with that of\nlow-frequency SQUID-SR devices (Hibbs et al 1995), and it would have the additional\nadvantage of being tunable over a wide range of frequencies and SQUID parameters.\n4.3.3. Stochastic resonance for periodically modulated noise intensity. We now discuss\nSR phenomena that can occur (Dykman et al 1992a) in a bistable system when the noise\nand the periodic force are introduced multiplicatively, so that the former is modulated by\nthe latter. Periodically modulated noise is not uncommon and arises, for example, at the\noutput of any amplifier (e.g. in optics or radio astronomy) whose amplification factor varies\nperiodically with time. It is of obvious importance, therefore, to establish whether or not\na modulated zero-mean noise can give rise to a periodic signal in the system it is driving.\n62\nSuch an effect would not, of course, occur in a linear system where the signal is directly\nproportional to the driving noise so that they must both, on average, vanish. We shall see\nthat in a nonlinear system, however, a periodic signal does arise and, furthermore, that in\na bistable system a form of SR can occur for periodically modulated noise intensity. It has\nsome novel features that are strikingly different from those in conventional SR.\nDykman et al (1992a) considered an overdamped Brownian particle moving in an\nasymmetric bistable potential\nPx C U 0.x\/ D f .t\/ \u0011 . 12A cos.t\/C 1\/\u0018.t\/ (78)\nU.x\/ D \u2212 12x2 C 14x4 C \u0015x:\nHere, \u0015 characterizes the asymmetry of the potential. For \u22122=.3p3\/ < \u0015 < 2=.3p3\/ the\npotential U.x\/ has two minima, i.e. the system is bistable.

Occasionally, there will be large fluctuations, sufficient to cause\ninter-well transitions. Periodic modulation of the noise influences both types of fluctuation,\nand so there are two contributions to the signal hx.t\/i: one from the modulation of the\nintra-well fluctuations; and the other from the modulation of the populations w1;2.t\/ of the\nwells 1, 2\nhx.t\/i \u2019\nX\nnD1;2\nhx.t\/inwn.t\/ (81)\nwhere h in implies averaging over the nth well.

Both the intra-well fluctuations\nand the transition probabilities W12 and W21 are then the same as they would be for white\nnoise of instantaneous intensity D (1 C A cost). The well populations w1 and w2 for\nperiodically modulated noise depend on the relationship between  and the Wnm.\nTo lowest order in the modulation amplitude A, the probability Wnm of an n ! m\ntransition is\nWnm \u0011 Wnm.t\/ \u2019 W.0\/nm\n\u0012\n1C A1Un\nD\ncost\n\u0013\n(83)\nwhere W.0\/nm \/ exp.\u22121Un=D\/ is the usual Kramers transition rate.

For a symmetric potential, the wells are equally\npopulated irrespective of noise intensity and so the modulation of the latter does not influence\nthe populations w1 and w2. For asymmetric potentials, on the other hand, the ratio of the\npopulations w.0\/1 =w\n.0\/\n2 \/ exp[.1U2 \u22121U1\/=D] depends sharply on the noise intensity, and\nwill be strongly influenced by the modulation of D. It is also evident that, for very large \u0010 ,\na weak modulation will not result in a substantial redistribution over the wells because the\nproduct w1w2 \/ exp.\u2212\u0010 \/ will remain exponentially small: j\u0014tr.\/j must, therefore, vary\nnon-monotonically with \u0010 \/ D\u22121, with a maximum at \u0010 D 1, and increase rapidly with D\nin the range exp.\u0010 \/\u001d 1. This increase can in itself give rise to stochastic resonance, since\nthe periodic signal is rising rapidly with increasing noise intensity.\nHowever, the intra-well fluctuations are also to be considered. Their contribution to\nthe susceptibility \u0014.\/ is connected with the local asymmetry of the potential about each\nof its minima, just as for the zero-frequency peaks in the power spectra of single-well\nunderdamped systems (Dykman et al 1991a). The partial susceptibility for the nth well,\n\u0014n.\/, can be obtained for small D by expanding U 0.x\/ in (78) to second order in (x\u2212 xn)\nand calculating (x \u2212 xn) formally to second order in f .t\/.

As usual, we characterize the influence of the\nnoise intensity on the response by the signal-to-noise ratio R equal to the ratio of the \u000e-like\nspike in the power spectral density of the fluctuations of the system (53) giving rise to the\nSNR R (54). Note that in contrast with conventional bistable SR (section 4.2), and SR\nfor monostable systems (section 4.3.2), the effective susceptibility \u0014.\/ is not now given\ndirectly by the fluctuation dissipation theorem in terms of Q.0\/.!\/.\nThe most interesting and important situation arises when the main contributions to both\n\u0014.\/ and Q.0\/.\/ are due to fluctuational inter-well transitions. In this case, (54) simplifies\nand, allowing for the explicit form (Dykman et al 1990c, d) of Q.0\/.\/, one can (Dykman\net al 1992a) obtain\nR \u2019 Rtr D \u00194 A\n2\u0010 2W\n.0\/\n12 W\n.0\/\n21 =.W\n.0\/\n12 CW.0\/21 \/: (88)\n64\nIt can be seen from (83) and (85) that Rtr \/ \u0010 2 exp.\u22121U=D\/, where 1U D\nmax.1U1;1U2\/ is the depth of the deeper potential well. For non-equal well depths,\nit is obvious that Rtr increases sharply with increasing D, i.e. stochastic resonance occurs.\nWe emphasize that (88) holds for \u0010 not too large: this is because the contributions to \u0014.\/\nand Q.0\/.\/ from the inter-well transitions are proportional to exp.\u2212\u0010 \/ compared to the\nintra-well contribution (cf equations (84)\u2013(87)) and, for large \u0010 , they become small.\nThe theory was tested (Dykman et al 1992a) by means of an analogue experiment\nmodelling (78). The circuit was very similar in design to that shown in figure 5(a), except\nfor: (i) provision of a constant voltage at point A to produce the asymmetry term Ax;\nand (ii) application of the scaled periodic force and the noise via an additional analogue\nmultiplier to provide the necessary modulation, creating the f .t\/ term. Measurements of\nthe signal-to-noise ratio R are shown by the square data points in figure 31. We note\nimmediately the occurrence of SR: the rate of increase of R is faster than D, so that it\ndoes not represent merely the proportionality of the modulation to D in (79). The lower\nfull curve in figure 31 represents a fit of the theory (54), (86) and (87) to the experimental\ndata, allowing for the explicit form (Dykman et al 1992b) of Q.0\/.\/, demonstrating the\nuniversal character of the shape of the SR.\nFigure 31. Measurements (square data points) of the signal-to-noise ratio R (\u000215) for\nperiodically modulated noise compared with theory (curves) as a function of reduced noise\nintensity D=1U with A D 0:14, \u0015 D 0:2,  D 0:029 (Dykman et al 1992a). The circle data\nrepresent measurements on the same circuit with additive periodic forcing (conventional SR)\nunder similar conditions compared with the theory (upper curves).\nIt is interesting to compare SR for periodically modulated driving noise with\nconventional SR (circle data and upper curve in figure 31) in periodically driven systems\nwhere f .t\/ in (78) is replaced by\nQf .t\/ D \u0018.t\/C A cost: (89)\nThe most substantial difference is that, in the present case, SR occurs for an asymmetric\nbistable potential with wells of different depths (see (85); (88)), whereas conventional SR\ncan be regarded (Dykman and Krivoglaz 1979, 1984, Dykman et al 1990c, d) as a kinetic\nphase transition phenomenon that is at its most pronounced for equally populated stable\nstates, i.e. for equal well depths. The asymmetry of the model (78) is controlled by \u0015,\n  65\n\u0010 \u0011 j1U1 \u22121U2j=D \u2019 2j\u0015j=D (90)\nfor j\u0015j \u001c 1, and R would, therefore, be expected (88) to increase rapidly with \u0015, whereas,\nfor additive periodic forcing, R decreases rapidly (Dykman et al 1990c, d) with increasing\nj\u0015j. These ideas were confirmed directly by the experimental data of figure 32(a). According\nto (88) and (90), R \/ \u00152 for small j\u0015j; but for large j\u0015j the increase saturates because the\ndepth of the deeper well increases, with a corresponding decrease in the contribution to\nR from inter-well transitions. We note that, for periodic forcing of the system described\nby (78) and (89), R should be larger than for periodic modulation of the noise for the\nsame dimensionless amplitude A, just because of the additional asymmetry factor \u0010 2 in\n(88). It can be seen from figure 31 that the theory (full curves) is in good agreement\nwith the experiment. The results of figure 32(b) demonstrate that the signal-to-noise ratio\nsaturates with increasing amplitude of the periodic modulation. The effect is more striking\nFigure 32. Measurements of the signal-to-noise ratio for periodically modulated noise (square\ndata points) and for additive periodic forcing, i.e. conventional SR (circle data) under similar\nconditions, for A D 0:15, D1U D 0:303 and  D 0:029. (a) The measurements are plotted\ndirectly as a function of the asymmetry parameter \u0015 for comparison with theory (curves).\n(b) (signal=noise)1=2 is plotted as a function of signal amplitude A at the input, for the same D\nand , with \u0015 D 0:2: note the linear dependence seen for small signals and the saturation for\nstrong signals, in the case of periodically modulated noise (Dykman et al 1992a).\n66\nthan the corresponding saturation in conventional SR, for which the additive periodic force\ndistorts the shape of the potential; cf Dykman et al (1993c) where nonlinear effects for\nlarge-amplitude modulation in conventional SR are considered.\nIt is also interesting to note that the anisotropy of the potential, which gives rise to SR\nfor periodically modulated noise, can also give rise to SR when the periodic modulation is\nparametric with the force proportional to the coordinate. This type of SR has been reported\nfor a parametrically-driven magnetoelastic ribbon (Spano et al 1992); it would also be\nanticipated in parametrically-driven bistable electronic systems (Debnath et al 1989) if the\npotential were made asymmetrical.\nIn concluding this subsection we would comment that, just as in the case of conventional\nSR, the main features of SR with periodically modulated noise can be well described within\nthe scope of LRT. The marked differences predicted to exist between these two types of\nSR, and in particular their quite different characteristic variations of R with the asymmetry\nof the potential, including the rapid decrease of R for additive periodic forcing, have been\nconvincingly confirmed by the analogue electronic experiments.\n4.4. Noise-enhanced heterodyning\nIn the well known phenomenon of heterodyning, two high-frequency fields\u2014an \u2018input\nsignal\u2019 and a \u2018reference signal\u2019\u2014are mixed nonlinearly to generate a heterodyne signal\nat the difference frequency. Mixing of this kind occurs quite generally in any nonlinear\nsystem. The addition of noise usually results in a decrease in the amplitude of the heterodyne\nsignal (and its SNR), because the frequency response of the system becomes correspondingly\nbroadened. Nonetheless, it has been shown theoretically and experimentally (Dykman et al\n1994a) that, in bistable systems of the kind that exhibit SR (see section 4.2), the heterodyne\nsignal (and SNR) can sometimes be enhanced by an increase in the noise intensity. We now\ndiscuss how this comes about. We consider an overdamped bistable system driven by three\ntime-dependent forces representing respectively the reference and input signals, and noise:\ndx\ndt\nD \u2212U 0.x\/C Arefx cos!0t C Ain.t\/ cos.!0t C \u001e.t\/\/C f .t\/: (91)\nHere, the terms proportional to Aref and proportional to Ain.t\/ are respectively the high-\nfrequency reference signal corresponding to a local oscillator of frequency !0 (applied\nmultiplicatively), and the modulated high-frequency input signal (applied additively). The\nfunctions Ain.t\/ and \u001e.t\/ vary slowly compared to cos!0t , and it is their variation in time\nthat has to be revealed via heterodyning. The heterodyning can be characterized by the\nlow-frequency signal at the output, x.sl\/.t\/ D x.t\/ (the overbar stands for averaging over\nthe period 2\u0019=!0), for Ain D constant and \u001e D t C constant, with  \u001c !0, i.e. for a\nmonochromatic input signal whose frequency !0C is slightly different from the frequency\n!0.\nDykman et al (1994a) considered the case where the double-well potential U.x\/ has\nequally deep wells, as in standard stochastic resonance, and for convenience chose it to be\nthe quartic potential (30). Its minima occur at xn D .\u22121\/n, n D 1; 2, and the characteristic\n(dimensionless) relaxation time of the system tr \u0011 1=U 00.xn\/ D 1=2. The analysis is not,\nof course, limited to the particular form of equations (30) and (91) and, in fact, the effect\noccurs in both overdamped and underdamped systems. The effect has also been observed\nin a totally different class of system\u2014a bistable all-optical cavity (Dykman et al 1995a).\nHowever, the explicit expressions take on a simpler form for the model (30) and (91); they\nare further simplified in the case when the frequencies of the input and reference signals\n  67\nare high compared with the reciprocal relaxation time of the system,\n!0 \u001d t\u22121r .tr D 12 \/: (92)\nThe term f .t\/ in (91) is a random force. It is assumed to be a zero-mean Gaussian noise.\nDykman et al (1994a) allowed for a form of this noise with two independent components, at\nlow and high frequencies respectively, with the latter being randomly modulated vibrations\nat frequency !0:\nf .t\/ D flf.t\/C fhf.t\/ fhf.t\/ D Re. Qfhf.t\/ exp.\u2212i!0t\/\/: (93)\nThe power spectrum 8lf.!\/ of the low-frequency noise flf.t\/ is assumed to be flat up to\n! \u0018 !c \u001d t\u22121r (!c may be small compared to !0). The power spectrum of fhf.t\/ is assumed\nto be centred at !0 and also flat over a range greatly exceeding t\u22121r .\nFor !0 \u001d t\u22121r the motion of the system consists of fast oscillations at frequency !0\n(and its overtones) superimposed on a slow motion. To first order in !\u221210 , the equation for\nthe slow part of the coordinate takes the form\nx.0\/ \u0019 x.sl\/\nPx.sl\/ D \u2212U 0.x.sl\/\/C A.t\/ sin\u001e.t\/C f .0\/.t\/ A.t\/ D Aref\n2!0\nAin.t\/ (94)\nwhere\nf .0\/.t\/ D flf.t\/\u2212 Aref2!0 Im\nQfhf.t\/ 8.0\/.!\/ \u0019 D=\u0019 for ! . !c (95)\nD D Dlf C .A2ref=2!20\/Dhf:\nThese equations are of a familiar form. For the case where A.t\/ and \u001e.t\/ vary slowly over\nthe time tr, the dynamics of the system (30), (94) and (95) have already been investigated\nin great detail in the context of SR and, as discussed in section 4.2, the system can be well\ndescribed in terms of LRT provided that A is small enough. In the particular case of a\nperiodic input signal, Ain D constant, \u001e D t C constant, the average (slow) part of the\ncoordinate hx.sl\/.t\/i varies periodically at the low modulation frequency , and the power\nspectrum of the coordinate contains \u000e-spikes at the frequencies n on top of the broad\nspectrum. For small A \/ Ain the vibrations of hx.sl\/.t\/i are practically monochromatic,\nhx.sl\/.t\/i D a0 C a sin .t\/, with their amplitude a and phase  given by the expression\na sin .t\/ D \u2212A Im.\u001f.\/ e\u2212i\u001e.t\/\/ \u001e.t\/ D t C constant: (96)\nFor small noise intensities (1U \u001d D) in the case of a symmetric double-well potential\nU.x\/, the susceptibility \u001f.\/ is (Dykman et al 1994a) of the form\n\u001f.\/ D 1\nt\u22121r \u2212 i\nC W\n4D\n.x2 \u2212 x1\/2\nW \u2212 i : (97)\nHere, W \u0011 W12 C W21 \/ exp.\u22121U=D\/ is the relaxation rate of the populations of the\nstable states. It is seen from (96) and (97) that, since W increases sharply with the noise\nintensity D, the amplitude of the heterodyne signal at the difference frequency  increases\nwith noise intensity in a certain range of D, too. Just as in standard SR, the noise-enhanced\nheterodyning (NEH) can be characterized by the SNR R which can be shown to be given\nby\nR D \u0019 A\n2.x2 \u2212 x1\/2\n16D2\nW 2 C2t2r QD2\nW C2t2r QD\nQD D 4D.x2 \u2212 x1\/\u22122 (98)\n; QD \u001c t\u22121r W \u001c QD\n68\nto lowest order in the small parameters in (98), cf (59) (where r is the reciprocal of tr in\n(98) and it has been set that x2 \u2212 x1 D 2). It follows from (98) (and also from the more\ngeneral expression for the SNR) that, in the range of noise intensities where\n QDtr . W . t\u22121r (99)\nthe SNR increases with increasing noise intensity. The increase is quite sharp, being nearly\nexponential. This means that noise-enhanced heterodyning would be expected to arise in a\nbistable system, whether driven by a low- or a high-frequency noise (or both).\nAn intuitive picture of the physical mechanism underlying NEH is as follows. The\nreference force provides a modulation of the potential .\u22121=2\/Arefx2 cos!0t which is even\nin the coordinate, and therefore does not break the symmetry of the system. The phases\nof the vibrations \u000exref.t\/ about the minima of the wells caused by this signal differ by \u0019\n(i.e. the vibrations are in counterphase). The situation is quite different for the input signal\nAin. This signal, being additive, breaks the symmetry of the potential, and the amplitude\nand phase of the periodic vibrations of the coordinate \u000exin.t\/ at the signal frequency !in\nare the same in the absence of the reference signal for both wells (the vibrations are in\nphase). When both forces are present, they combine nonlinearly giving rise to potential\nterms oscillating at combination frequencies, and in particular to a term at the difference\nfrequency j!0 \u2212 !inj which is proportional, approximately, to the product of \u000exref \u0002 \u000exin.\nThis term defines the slow motion of the system. Obviously, it is antisymmetric: its sign\nis opposite for the two wells.\nThe amplitude of the fast oscillations induced in the system by the superimposed\nreference and input signals varies slowly in time, as the effects of the individual signals tend\nalternately to reinforce or cancel each other. These amplitude variations occur in antiphase\nbetween the two wells: when the amplitude of the fast oscillation is relatively large in one\nwell, it is relatively small in the other, and vice versa . The particular well for which the\nfast vibrations are of the larger amplitude at a given time will also be the one from which\nfluctuational transitions are most likely to occur. This is because the centre of oscillations is\nthen shifted furthest towards the saddle, much like the case of quasimonochromatic noise in\nthe adiabatic limit (Dykman 1990; see also section 6). In the presence of noise, therefore,\nthere is an enhanced probability of an inter-well transition occurring once per half-cycle of\nthe difference frequency, thereby effectively amplifying the heterodyne signal in very much\nthe same way as a low-frequency additive signal can be amplified in conventional bistable\nSR.\nThe occurrence of NEH was sought and investigated experimentally using the circuit\nmodel shown in figure 33. It was driven by a signal A0in cos.!00C0\/t 0 and a multiplicatively\napplied reference signal A0ref cos!00t 0. Here A0in and A0ref are the amplitudes of the signals\nin volts, f 0.t 0\/ is the actual value of the noise applied to the circuit, and !00 and t 0 are the\nreal frequency and time, respectively. The actual differential equation for the voltage x 0 in\nthe circuit was of the form\nR1C1\ndx 0\ndt 0\nD R9\nR6\nR1\nR3\nx 0 \u2212 R9\n100R7\nR5R1\nR4R3\nx 03 C R9\n10R8\nR1\nR3\nA0refx\n0 cos!00t\n0\nCR1\nR2\nA0in cos.!\n0\n0 C0\/t 0 C f 0.t 0\/ (100)\nwith\nR1 D R2 D R3 D R4 D R7 D R8 D 10 k\nR5 D R9 D 50 k R6 D 200 k C1 D 30 nF:\n  69\nFigure 33.

Normalized heterodyne signal S and signal-to-noise ratio R (inset) as functions of\nthe intensity of the low frequency noise D for !0 D 1:885,  D 0:008 (Dykman et al 1994a).\nThe squares represent the experimental data; the curves represent the theory, which has been\ndotted in the range of large D where it is only qualitative.\nAfter appropriate scalings (Dykman et al 1994a), and changing x 0 ! x, (100) goes over\ninto (91) for the potential (30). The circuit was driven by noise from a feedback shift-\nregister noise generator and by two sinusoidal periodic forces from Hewlett\u2013Packard 3325B\nfrequency synthesizers.\nMeasurements of the amplitude of the heterodyne signal S D a2=Ain, and the SNR R\n(98) and their dependences on noise intensity, are compared with the theoretical predictions\n(curves) based on (96) and (98) in figure 34. It is clearly seen that the dependence of the\nsignal amplitude on D is of the form of an asymmetric resonant curve, which is extremely\nsteep on the small-D side. This form is typical of SR (see section 4.2). For small D,\nwhere the system is effectively confined to one well of the potential, the signal magnitude\ncorresponds in effect to the value it would have for heterodyning in a single-well nonlinear\npotential, and is extremely small. The dependence of the SNR on D (inset) is also similar\nto that seen in stochastic resonance: for very small D where the inter-well transitions do\nnot come into play, R decreases with increasing D, but then it displays a sharp increase.\n70\nWe notice that the maximum of R.D\/ is shifted to higher noise intensities compared to that\nof the amplitude of the heterodyne signal. The experimental data are in good qualitative\nand quantitative agreement with the simple theory (curves) outlined above and described in\nmore detail by Dykman et al (1994a). There are no adjustable parameters.\nIt follows from (94) and (98) that the SNR, for a given effective noise intensity D,\nshould be proportional to the squared amplitudes of both the reference and input signals,\nand inversely proportional to the squared reference frequency !0. These and several other\npredictions of the theory were observed to hold over a broad range of parameters (Dykman\net al 1994a).\nIt is evident that, in close analogy to conventional SR, NEH in a bistable system can\nproduce a very substantial enhancement of the heterodyne signal over that obtained by\nheterodyning in, for example, a single-well nonlinear system. The same is not true, however,\nof the SNR. Notwithstanding the huge noise-induced rises seen in R.D\/ in NEH, and in\nconventional SR, the SNR does not quite reach the value it would have for the same D in\na single-well system. Nonetheless, we note that NEH offers a method by which the SNR\ncan be protected against changes in the ambient noise level, if the average operating point\nis chosen to be very close to, but slightly beyond, the maximum in R.D\/. In applications\nwhere it is important for the SNR to be stable, this could prove to be a useful feature.\nAnother advantageous feature of NEH is that it provides high-frequency selectivity.\nBuilding on the understanding gained from studies of the analogue electronic model,\nboth SR and NEH were subsequently observed in a passive nonlinear optical system\n(Dykman et al 1995a, b).\n4.5. Noise-induced linearization\nFinally, in this section on SR, we discuss the closely related phenomenon of noise-induced\nlinearization which was identified in the course of experiments on SR, using analogue\nelectronic models (Dykman et al 1994b). The unexpected observation was that the signal\ndistortion introduced by passage through a nonlinear system could usually be reduced by the\naddition at the input of external white noise of sufficient intensity. (For convenience, we will\nconcentrate on the effects of white or quasi-white noise. Most of the discussion, however,\nis applicable qualitatively, and sometimes quantitatively, to the case of non-white noise,\nprovided that its correlation time is shorter than the characteristic reciprocal frequencies\nof interest.) The scenario was found to hold experimentally for many different nonlinear\nsystems, including monostable as well as bistable, underdamped as well as overdamped,\nchaotic as well as regular, and for signals of various shapes. Because the resultant linearized\noutput x.t\/ is inevitably noisy, we consider how the ensemble average hx.t\/i of the output\nvaries with relevant parameters, for example with the noise intensity at the input.\nA simple example of the effect was obtained from the standard SR system (30) and (57)\nmodelling overdamped Brownian motion. Consider the periodic signal before and after\npassage through the system. Some results are shown in figure 35 showing that for very\nweak noise the response is similar to a square wave (Dykman et al 1993f) but that, as the\nnoise intensity increases, the original sinusoidal wave is gradually restored. If the sinusoidal\nsignal is replaced with a sawtooth waveform, much the same behaviour is observed, as\nshown in figure 36.\nThe basic idea of linearization by added noise is, of course, already familiar from\nspecific observations and applications in science and engineering, for example the removal\nof digitization steps in the output of an ADC, the linearization of periodic signals in\nneurophysiological experiments (French et al 1972) or the linearization of the response\n  71\nFigure 35. Noise-induced linearization for a sine wave passing through an electronic model\nof the overdamped double-well system given by equations (30) and (57). The periodic force\nat the input is shown in the upper trace. The ensemble-averaged response hq.t\/i, measured at\nthe output, is shown for different noise intensities D in the lower traces. The amplitudes of the\nlatter have been normalized so as to be comparable with the amplitude of the force, for easier\ncomparison of their relative shapes (Dykman et al 1994b).\nFigure 36. Noise-induced linearization for a sawtooth wave passing through an electronic\nmodel of the overdamped bistable system given by equations (30) and (57). The periodic force\nat the input is shown in the upper trace. The ensemble-averaged response hq.t\/i, measured at\nthe output, is shown for different noise intensities D in the lower traces. The amplitudes of\nthe latter have been normalized so as to be comparable with the amplitude of the force, for\neasier comparison of their relative shapes (Dykman et al 1994b).\nof ring-laser gyroscopes at low angular velocities (Vogel et al 1987a). The results under\ndiscussion suggested, however, that noise-induced linearization may exist as a more general\nphenomenon than had been appreciated, thus further illustrating the idea (Millonas 1996)\nthat the role of noise in a dynamical system may often be, in a sense, creative.\nNote that we use the word linearization in two rather different senses, and that these are\nexemplified by the results of figures 35 and 36. The fact that a sinusoidal input can pass\nthrough the system without significant change of shape, as occurs for strong noise in the\nlowest trace in figure 35, implies linearity in the direct sense, i.e. a proportionality between\nthe amplitudes of output and input; this need not necessarily, however, imply that the\nconstant of proportionality must be frequency independent. On the other hand, the results\n72\nof figure 36, for a sawtooth waveform containing not only the fundamental frequency but\nalso its higher harmonics, imply the occurrence of linearization in the \u2018Hi-Fi\u2019 sense that the\nsystem becomes non-dispersive within a certain frequency range when the noise intensity is\nlarge enough. In many cases of physical interest nonlinearity of the response arises because\nthe frequency of the driving force (or its overtones) is close to some eigenfrequency of the\nsystem (or its overtones), or is related in a certain way to the relaxation time of the system.\nIt is to be expected for such systems that linearization of the response in the sense of\nproportionality of output and input will not necessarily imply suppression of the frequency\ndispersion. (Obviously, one could try to devise special circumstances which might violate\nthis rule. One possible example would be a logarithmic amplifier. However, even though\nthis would be dispersion-free but highly nonlinear for low noise intensities, it seems likely\nnonetheless that the response would be eventually linearized by noise, just like the other\ncases that we consider.)\nThe physical origin of both forms of signal restoration can readily be understood, at\nleast qualitatively, in the following terms. Where the amplitude response of a system to a\nperiodic force is nonlinear, this arises because the amplitude of the vibrations induced by\nthe force is comparable with, or larger than, some characteristic nonlinear length scale of the\nsystem. The scale in question (which may depend on frequency, see later) is determined by\nthe structure of the region of phase space being visited by the system and by corresponding\nfeatures in the dynamics. The effect of noise is to smear the system over a larger region of\nphase space, so that a variety of different scales and frequencies then become involved in the\nmotion, even in the absence of periodic driving, and the effective characteristic scale will\nusually increase as a result. For sufficiently large noise intensities, therefore, the amplitude\nof the force-induced vibrations will become small compared to the scale (e.g. small compared\nto the average size of the noise-induced fluctuations), so that the nonlinearity of the response\nis correspondingly reduced. The system is then spending an increased proportion of its time\nfar away from its attractor(s), at coordinate values where the timescale that characterizes\nthe motion is in general quite different and sometimes shorter than that for small noise\nintensities. Consequently, there will be one or more ranges of frequency for which dispersion\nis likely to decrease (Stocks et al 1996). Although the linearization and the suppression of\nthe dispersion arise, ultimately, through the same physical processes\u2014the effect of noise in\nsmearing the system over a larger region of its phase space\u2014they do not necessarily become\nimportant at the same noise intensity. Dykman et al (1994b) and Stocks et al (1996) have\ngiven detailed analyses of noise-induced linearization phenomena in the standard SR system\n(30) and (57).\nThe harmonic oscillator provides a familiar example in which the two types of\nlinearization are quite distinct: the response is always linear, the amplitude of the\nforced vibrations being proportional to the amplitude of the force; at the same time,\ndispersion can be very strong, particularly for an underdamped oscillator in the range of its\neigenfrequency. For nonlinear systems, the narrow peaks in spectral densities of fluctuations\nare eventually (Dykman and Krivoglaz 1984) broadened by an increase in noise intensity;\nfor underdamped systems, one of the basic broadening mechanisms comes about because the\neigenfrequencies of vibration depend on amplitude, so that the broader the distribution over\namplitude becomes, due to the increasing fluctuations, the broader becomes the distribution\nover eigenfrequencies (Dykman and Krivoglaz 1984, Dykman et al 1989, Dykman and\nMcClintock 1992).\nIt is important to note, and it is clear from the above example, that the same\nphysical processes which give rise to noise-induced linearization can also, under special\ncircumstances, give rise to the opposite effect of noise-induced delinearization. The latter\n  73\nphenomenon is to be anticipated if the additional frequencies that become involved (as the\nresult of an increase in noise intensity) resonate with the periodic force or with one of its\nharmonics, as in zero-dispersion phenomena (see section 4.3.2), or if the noise modifies\nthe characteristic reciprocal relaxation time of the system so that it corresponds to the\nfrequency of the periodic force, as in conventional stochastic resonance. In such cases,\njust as seen above for the system (30) and (57), it is to be expected that the promotion\nof nonlinearity by noise at intermediate intensities will be followed by the more general\nphenomenon of noise-induced linearization at still higher noise intensities owing to the\nusual noise-induced broadening of the relevant spectral peak(s). We have also observed and\ninvestigated sequential noise-induced delinearization=linearization phenomena in dynamical\nsystems quite different from (30) and (57): cf the theoretical results cited and experimental\nresults on an underdamped monostable oscillator discussed in section 4.3.2, as well as the\nresults on the nonlinear response of such an oscillator (Dykman et al 1996a).\n5. Transient effects\nIt often happens that one or more of the parameters characterizing a system change\nsystematically with time. Consequently, the distributions of its coordinates and momenta\nalso evolve with time. If a swept parameter changes slowly enough, the system may usually\nbe regarded as remaining in quasi-equilibrium; the distributions are therefore almost the same\nas they would be for fixed values of the parameter in question. If the parameter changes\nrelatively fast, however, this kind of adiabatic approximation is inapplicable because the\nsystem never has time to approach equilibrium, and a satisfactory description in general\nrepresents a difficult problem. Of particular interest is the situation that arises when the\nparameter is swept past some critical point of the system where a bifurcation occurs: critical\nslowing down means that, sufficiently close to the bifurcation, an adiabatic approximation\nwill always fail. A well known physical example is that of a laser close to threshold, where\nthe pump parameter moves past the critical value for the onset of lasing. In this section\nwe consider two extreme situations, both of which have been investigated successfully\nthrough analogue electronic experiments. First, in section 5.1, we discuss an example of\nwhat happens when the swept parameter moves continuously past a critical value; then,\nin section 5.2, we consider an interesting phenomenon that occurs when the parameter is\nswitched discontinuously from a sub-threshold to a super-threshold value, thereby placing\nthe system transiently in an unstable state which subsequently decays.\n5.1. Swept-parameter systems\nAnalogue experiments on symmetrical bifurcating swept-parameter systems (Stocks et al\n1989c, 1990) and their comparison with the theories of Torrent and San Miguel (1988),\nVan den Broeck and Mandel (1987), Zeghlache et al (1989), Torrent and San Miguel\n(1988) and Torrent et al (1990) have already been reviewed in detail (Dykman et al 1994c)\nelsewhere. In this subsection we consider, instead, an example of an interesting phenomenon\nthat occurs when the bifurcating system has a small\u2014perhaps very small\u2014asymmetry.\nThe investigations (Moss et al 1985a, Kondepudi et al 1986a, b) addressed the question\nof sensitivity in symmetry-breaking transitions, in quite general terms. They were motivated\nby attempts (Kondepudi and Nelson 1983, 1985) to account for the chiral symmetry of\nbiological molecules and, in particular, to try to explain why the lower energy enantiomer\nhas apparently been selected by evolution (Mason 1985), even though the energy difference\nbetween L- and D-amino acids is much smaller than kBT . The difference, due to\n74\nparity-violating weak neutral current interactions (the so-called Z-force) is so small that,\non purely energetic grounds, L-amino acids would be expected to outnumber their D-amino\nacid enantiomers by only 1 part in 1017; yet life is based on L-amino acids. As a possible\nexplanation, Kondepudi and Nelson (1983, 1985) suggested that a very slow passage through\na bifurcation could amplify a tiny effect of this kind because of the extreme sensitivity of the\nsystem to a small symmetry-breaking force when near the critical point. If x is the amplitude\nof the solution that experiences symmetry-breaking then, by elimination of the fast modes\n(Haken 1977, Nicolis and Prigogine 1977), one can obtain an equation of the form\nPx D \u2212Ax3 C B.\u0015\u2212 \u0015c\/x C Cg (101)\nwhere A, B and C are constants that depend on the system, \u0015 is the control parameter that\nis to be swept and g is a small interaction or bias that selects among the broken-symmetry\nstates. Note that (101) is very general: its form is determined by the symmetry that is\nbroken, not by details of the particular system (Guckenheimer and Holmes 1983).\nThe steady states of (101) are shown in figure 37. With g D 0, and assuming weak\nadditive noise, each of the supercritical branches\nx D \u0006\np\nB.\u0015\u2212 \u0015c\/=A (102)\nwill be selected with equal probability as \u0015 is swept through \u0015c. When g 6D 0, however, the\nbifurcation is no longer of the pitchfork type where two stable solutions and an unstable one\nmerge together; rather, the two stable branches are then separated by a minimum distance\n3.Cg=2A\/1=3. Far above or below the critical point, the displacement of the x \u2019 0 solution\ndue to non-zero Cg is \u0018Cg=B.\u0015 \u2212 \u0015c\/. Thus, the effect of Cg \u001c 1 is much larger near\nthe critical point than away from it. The theory (Kondepudi et al 1986a) predicts that state\nselection will be strongly enhanced by a slow sweep of \u0015 past \u0015c.\nFigure 37. A pitchfork bifurcation showing: (a) perfect symmetry, with g D 0; and (b) in the\npresence of a symmetry-breaking interaction with g > 0 (Kondepudi et al 1986a).\nThe electronic model used (Kondepudi et al 1986a) for testing these ideas is shown\ndiagrammatically in figure 38; for convenience, \u0015c was set to zero. The voltage representing\nthe changing parameter \u0015.T \/ was derived from a sweep generator, and a switch was used\nto short circuit the integrator and set x D 0 prior to the start of each sweep. Small non-\nidealities in the components meant that it was impossible to set g D 0 rigorously: the\n  75\nFigure 38. A block diagram of the electronic circuit model of (101). The shorting switch on the\nintegrator can be closed with a pulse at t D 0 to set x.0\/ D 0 but it is normally open (Kondepudi\net al 1986a).\nFigure 39. Example x.t\/ trajectories measured for g D \u22120:016, Vn D 0:50 V. Negative branch\nselection as in (a) is about 8.3 times as probable as positive branch selection as in (b), in this\nexample. The full curves are the measured deterministic steady states (Kondepudi et al 1986a).\nsmallest value achievable in practice was g \u2019 0:003 V which was, however, almost an\norder of magnitude smaller than the smallest value that was set explicitly.\nTwo typical trajectories measured for the swept system are shown in figure 39: the\nlower of these is more probable than the upper. To obtain the evolution of the probability\ndistribution, 5000 such trajectories were collected and ensemble averaged at different fixed\ntimes, yielding the results shown in the lower part of figure 40. The upper evolution shows,\nfor comparison, what happens when \u0015 is not swept, but the system is just released at x D 0\nin the presence of noise. The selectivity S of the more probable state has been increased\nfrom 1.7 (static release) to 21.6 (swept \u0015). A comparison of measured and calculated\nvalues of S for g D 0:016, \u000f1=2 D 0:133, an integrator time constant of \u001ci D 100 \u0016s\nand different sweep rates is given in table 1 (Kondepudi et al 1986a); the theory is only\napplicable when the sweep rate is fast enough for the probability density to be approximated\nby a drifting Gaussian. The agreement between theory and experiment may be regarded as\nsatisfactory.\n76\nFigure 40. Measured time-evolving probability distributions P.x; t\/ for two different sets of\ncircumstances.

The same noise\nlevel applied in both cases and the same magnitude of g was used, though its sign was reversed\nto illustrate selection of both branches. Note that the selectivity S was very much larger in\ncase (b) with the swept parameter (Kondepudi et al 1986a).\nTable 1.

Over a period of 50 000\u2013\n100 000 years, there would have been a 98% chance that the Z-force would have caused\nselection of the lower energy enantiomer, so life would then have evolved in that form.\nWhether or not symmetry breaking actually occurred at the pre-biotic stage, and the nature of\nthe process(es) through which it occurred, continue to be vigorously debated (Cline 1996)\u2014\nbut the electronic experiments show beyond reasonable doubt that the underlying mechanism\nproposed by Kondepudi and Nelson (1983, 1985) does work. It is not strongly influenced\nby correlation time, in the case of exponentially correlated coloured noise (Kondepudi et al\n1986b), and it is potentially applicable in a variety of scientific and technological contexts.\n  77\n5.2. Decay of unstable states and transient multimodality\nIf a control parameter, for example \u0015 in (101) with Cg D 0, is changed discontinuously\nfrom below to above its critical value, the system will find itself in an unstable state. How\nthis state subsequently decays will obviously depend on the nature of the system under\nstudy, and on the kind and intensity of the noise. A convenient way of characterizing the\ndecay is in terms of nonlinear relaxation times (NLRTs) which are defined in terms of the\ntransient moments. For a process x.t\/ defined by a Langevin-like equation of the general\nform\nPx D v.x; t\/C g.x; t\/\u0018.t\/ (103)\nthe NLRT associated with the average (over realizations of the noise \u0018.t\/) of a quantity\n\u001e.x\/ is defined (Binder 1973, Ra\u00b4cz 1976) by\nT\u001e D\nZ 1\n0\nh\u001e.t\/i \u2212 h\u001eist\nh\u001eii \u2212 h\u001eist dt: (104)\nHere, h\u001eii is the average value of \u001e in the initial state, h\u001e.t\/i is the average value of\n\u001e during the evolution from a given initial distribution to the final stationary distribution,\nwhere the average value of \u001e is given by h\u001eist. Depending on the particular problem and\nfor appropriate choices of the quantity \u001e.x\/, this may be a definition of a certain global\ntime scale for the relaxation of initial conditions towards the steady state. The interest of\nthis definition lies in the fact that the NLRTs can be usually calculated via techniques based\non knowledge of the evolution operator of the probability densities. The formalism can\nbe systematized in a way which parallels the calculation of the first passage time (FPT)\nmoments and has turned out to have some practical and theoretical advantages over them.\nIts usefulness has been checked in the context of white noise (Jime\u00b4nez-Aquino et al 1988,\nCasademunt et al 1989a), but the advantages have been found particularly marked in the\ncase of coloured-noise problems (Casademunt and Sancho 1989).\nThe NLRT has been measured and investigated in analogue electronic experiments\n(Casademunt et al 1989c). It was studied for both white noise and (exponentially correlated)\ncoloured noise, fixed initial conditions and distributed initial conditions; and in the latter\ncase, for coloured noise, a distinction was made between coupled initial conditions where\na correlation exists between fluctuations just before and after the change in the control\nparameter, and uncoupled initial conditions where the noise sources before and after the\nchange are uncorrelated. These experiments (Casademunt et al 1989c), and their comparison\nwith the body of theory introduced by the Barcelona group (Casademunt and Sancho 1989,\nCasademunt et al 1989a, b) have been reviewed by Dykman et al (1994d), and need not\nbe discussed further here. It is worth emphasizing, however, that the analogue experiments\nwere very readily able to provide all the permutations of noise and initial conditions that\nwere required.\nFollowing Iwaniszewski et al (1994), we now describe investigations of an interesting\nphenomenon, transient multimodality (TM), that can occur during the decay of an unstable\nstate. In TM, there is a period during the evolution of the system when the number of\nmaxima in the probability distribution is larger than it is in either the initial or final state, i.e.\nfor a sizeable interval of time, the system can be found with comparable probability in any\none of a number of states that is larger than the number of its steady states. Such behaviour\nwas first reported by Baras et al (1983), Frankowicz and Nicolis (1983) and Frankowicz\net al (1984) in theoretical studies of explosive chemical reactions and combustion. Later\non the possibility of TM was mentioned for some optically bistable systems (Broggi and\nLugiato 1984a, b, Broggi et al 1985; Lugiato et al 1986) and for Brownian particles in\n78\nshear flows (Wio and Zanette 1993). The theoretical predictions were confirmed by means\nof numerical simulations (Baras et al 1983, Frankowicz and Nicolis 1983, Broggi and\nLugiato 1984a, b, Broggi et al 1985, de Pasquale and Mecozzi 1985, Mitschke et al 1985)\nand experiments on optical bistability (Lugiato et al 1986, Mitschke et al 1985, Lange\net al 1985, Lange 1988, Nalik et al 1989), an electronic circuit (Mitschke et al 1985),\na laser with a saturable absorber (Arimondo et al 1987), a semiconductor laser (Spano\net al 1990), electrohydrodynamic convection in nematic liquid crystals (Kai et al 1992),\ncombustion processes (Lemarchand et al 1989) and also through studies of the dynamics\nof error growth in numerical calculations (Nicolis and Nicolis 1991).\nThe usual theoretical description associates TM with evolution in a potential with a\nflat plateau, for which critical slowing down occurs (Broggi and Lugiato 1984a, Broggi\net al 1985). The fluctuations driving the system accelerate the evolution of some\nstochastic realizations over the flat region, after which the system is rapidly switched to\nthe vicinity of a stable state xs. Since some stochastic realizations still remain at the\nplateau region one observes the bunching of trajectories in two places, namely at the\nplateau and in the bottom of the potential well. Thus the probability distribution possesses\ntwo maxima. This phenomenon arises some time after the initial probability distribution\npeak reaches the plateau and it disappears again once an appropriate mass of probability\ndistribution (i.e. a sufficient proportion of stochastic trajectories) has left the flat part of the\npotential.\nSuch behaviour can occur (Valle et al 1990, Colet et al 1991) if the evolution of a system\nis characterized by two different time scales. The longer one results from the long induction\nstage at the potential plateau. It is of the order of the mean first passage time (MFPT) T\nneeded to reach the edge of the flat region. However, because of the essential role played by\nfluctuations at this stage of the evolution, the actual value of this time for a given realization\nis distributed within an interval of the order of the variance 1T of the MFPT, which is of\nthe same order as T . The shorter time scale td is associated with the deterministic transit\nfrom the edge of the plateau to the bottom of the potential. In terms of these time scales\nthe type of evolution can be characterized by the ratio \u0011 D td=1T . TM is possible provided\n\u0011 < 1. In contrast, if \u0011 > 1, most of the stochastic trajectories leave the plateau region\nbefore any of them reach the vicinity of xs. Thus the probability of finding the system\nsomewhere between the plateau and the bottom is large and, consequently, the probability\ndistribution peak travels continuously towards its stationary position. The relation \u0011 < 1\nis known (Caroli et al 1980) to apply close to a marginal state (U 0.x\/ D U 00.x\/ D 0) but\nnot in the vicinity of an arbitrary unstable state xu (U 0.xu\/ D 0, U 00.xu\/ < 0). Hence,\nsome authors (Broggi et al 1985; Arimondo et al 1987, Colet et al 1991) conclude that,\ngenerally, TM is not expected during relaxation from the top of a potential barrier. The\nparabolic curvature of the barrier does not generate two different time scales if the noise\nintensity is not small (otherwise there arises the logarithmic Suzuki time (Suzuki 1976)). It\nshould be noted, however, that this conclusion stemmed from the analysis of only one type\nof potential, namely the quartic potential\nU.x\/ D 14bx4 C 12ax2 (105)\n(with b > 0, a < 0) that is usually considered while dealing with the decay of an unstable\nstate (e.g. Suzuki 1976).\nIwaniszewski (1992a) showed, however, that TM should also arise during evolution\nfrom an unstable state xu. This effect applies to a very wide class of systems, even in\ncases very far from marginality. It turns out that the type of evolution (continuous or TM)\nto be anticipated depends only on the sign of the fourth derivative of the potential in the\n  79\nunstable state\u2014if it is negative some new peaks must appear before the initial maximum at\nxu disappears. However, it also means that the potential\u2019s curvature at the unstable state is\nmuch steeper than in the parabolic case, so that the system should leave the vicinity of xu\nvery quickly. We now consider how to reconcile this result with the earlier discussion in\nterms of time scales.\nIwaniszewski et al (1994) considered a one-dimensional overdamped oscillator subject\nto the force derived from a double-well potential and a Gaussian white noise. Its evolution\nis governed by the Langevin equation\nPx D \u2212U 0.x\/C \u0018.t\/ (106)\nwith a symmetrical sixth-order polynomial potential\nU.x\/ D 16cx6 C 14bx4 C 12ax2: (107)\nThe parameter a < 0 fulfils the requirement of instability at xu D 0, b determines the sign\nof d4Udx4 jxD0 and c > 0 ensures the existence of stable states \u0006xs. The noise \u0018.t\/, of zero\nmean, is characterized by its correlation function\nh\u0018.t\/\u0018.t 0\/i D 2D\u000e.t \u2212 t 0\/ (108)\nwhere D is the noise strength.\nAnalogue experiments were used to confirm that TM really occurs during the decay of\nan unstable state. The circuit used to model (106)\u2013(108) is shown schematically in figure 41\n(cf Casademunt et al 1989c). Two independent Gaussian, exponentially correlated noises\n4 and Z are supplied from feedback shift-register noise generators. Since the noises\u2019\ncorrelation times are of the order of one tenth of the time constant of the Miller integrator,\nthey are perceived as effectively white noises with correlation functions\nh4.\u001c\/4.\u001c 0\/i D 2\u0012\u0018V 2\u0018 \u000e.\u001c \u2212 \u001c 0\/ (109)\nhZ.\u001c\/Z.\u001c 0\/i D 2\u0012\u0010V 2\u0010 \u000e.\u001c \u2212 \u001c 0\/ (110)\nwhere V 2\u0018 and V 2\u0010 are the variances of the noise voltages. A square-wave signal periodically\noperates a solid-state switch S (DG303ACJ) to alter the system between two versions of\nthe circuit. The first one (disconnected in figure 41) prepares the required distribution of\ninitial conditions and it operates within a linear Langevin equation\ndVx\nd\u001c\nD \u2212\u0015Vx C Z\u0010 .\u001c\/: (111)\nSince the half-period of the switching signal is much longer than the relaxation time of\nthis circuit, the stationary distribution of (111), namely a Gaussian distribution centred at\nVx D 0, is generated. During the second half-period the main circuit comes into action (see\nfigure 14) giving\ndVx\nd\u001c\nD \u2212\u03b3V 5x \u2212 \fVbV 3x \u2212 .\u000b1Va C \u000b2V 2b \/Vx C4.\u001c\/: (112)\nAll of the parameters indicated by small Greek letters in equations (109)\u2013(112) can be\nexpressed [25, 26] in terms of component values in the electronic system.\nAfter the scalings Vx D Ax and \u001c D Bt , (109) and (112) yield the required equations\n(106)\u2013(108) while equations (110) and (111) guarantee a Gaussian initial distribution with\na variance \u001a0. The four voltages Va , Vb, V\u0018 and V\u0010 are set externally to vary the parameters\nof the potential U.x\/, the noise strength x and the width \u001a0 of the initial distribution.\nThe output, a time-dependent voltage Vx.t\/, was analysed by means of a Nicolet NIC-80\ncomputer system. For each realization of x.t\/ an initial state was first prepared according\n80\nFigure 41.

The signals connected to the top of\nthe multipliers are added to the results of the multiplication (Iwaniszewski et al 1994).\nto (111) with the required statistics (an appropriate value of \u001a0). Then, as the system\nwas switched to the main circuit, the Nicolet ADC was triggered and an input sweep was\nacquired: 1024 values of Vx.t\/ were digitized and recorded at equal time intervals, with\n12-bit precision. The sweep was analysed by examining each 16th value and incrementing\nthe corresponding point of a 64-level distribution. The process then repeated, building up\na set of 64 64-point distributions separated by equal intervals of time, and was continued\nuntil the statistics were adequate. It turned out that 2\u0002 104 realizations were sufficient.\nThe results obtained confirmed immediately the existence of TM in (106)\u2013(108). An\nexample of the time evolution of the probability distributionW.x; t\/ for b < 0 is exhibited as\na three-dimensional plot in figure 42(a). The existence of a time regime within which three\nprobability distribution peaks coexist is clearly evident. A comparison of the experimental\nhistograms of the instantaneous probability distribution for several different fixed times\nis shown in figure 42(b). Notwithstanding the statistical fluctuations in the shape of\nW.x; t\/, the trimodal character of the probability distribution at intermediate times is clearly\ndemonstrated.\nIwaniszewski (1992b) showed that, for the potential (107), TM can appear not only for\nb < 0 but also for some positive values of b, namely for b < bc D\nq\n\u2212 53ac. An example of\nthe evolution of the probability distribution measured for positive b is given in figure 43.\nIt is seen, that, within the experimental accuracy, the evidence of TM is very weak. Over\na comparatively long period of time, the probability distribution remains very flat, almost\nuniform, and the difference between the heights of the maxima and minima is very small,\nso that the effect of TM is rather insignificant. As the value of b was reduced from bc the\nphenomenon of TM became more clearly resolved, although it lasted for a very short time.\nAs b crossed zero the coexistence of three probability distribution peaks became evident\nand the TM persisted for a very long time. Such behaviour agrees well with the previous\nanalysis of Iwaniszewski (1992b) which distinguished short life (0 < b < bc) and long life\n(b < 0) forms of TM. In the former case, the properties of the potential determine the finite\ntime of coexistence of the three peaks, while in the latter case it is only the strength of the\n  81\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 42.

Hence, if q is very\nsmall, the effect will be observed over rather a long period and TM eventually seems to\ndisappear because of the experimental indistinguishability of the middle maximum and the\nminima.\nIwaniszewski (1992b) also showed that both sources of randomness, i.e. the random\ninitial conditions and the stochastic force, affect the appearance of TM. The simpler case\nfor theoretical treatment is that of deterministic evolution with a Gaussian distribution over\ninitial states of width \u001a0. He performed some calculations for small \u001a0. In particular, he\nderived formulae for the critical time tcr and position xcr of the appearance of new maxima\n82\nFigure 43.

The dependence of xcr on the initial distribution width \u001a0 is small compared\nto the experimental inaccuracy, so only the experimental data for \u001a0 D 0:01 are shown\non figure 44. Due to some slight asymmetries in the circuit the probability distribution is\nnot exactly symmetric, and so the positions of left and right critical points are indicated\nseparately; the averages of the left and right critical time values are shown by the data in\nfigure 45.\nThe experimental uncertainties in the shape of W.x; t\/ make it impossible to identify\nthe exact time of appearance of a new maximum. To be sure that a given small hump is\nindeed a new probability distribution peak, and not just a fluctuation, the value of tcr is\nslightly overestimated. Thus, the experimental data in figure 45 are slightly greater than\nthe analytic ones. Similarly, since a new maximum tends almost immediately after its\nappearance to the vicinity of its stationary position (see figure 3 in Iwaniszewski 1992b),\nthe experimental values of xcr are a little higher than the theoretical ones. Another source\nof error, believed to be unimportant, must come from the finite grid of voltage values\u2014the\n83\nFigure 44.

The position of\nthe stationary maximum xs (115) is shown by the broken curve (Iwaniszewski et al 1994).\nFigure 45.

Despite the non-ideality introduced by\nthis coarse-graining, remarkably good agreement was obtained between the theoretical and\nexperimental results.\nIwaniszewski et al (1994) go on to consider in detail the relationships between the shape\nof the potential, time scales an the possibility of TM during relaxation from an unstable\n84\nstate. They also discuss the relationship between marginality and TM. The analogue model,\nand its observed behaviour, underpinned and motivated the discussion by tying the theory\nclosely to what could be observed in an actual experiment.\n6. Phenomena induced by quasimonochromatic noise\nMost of the work discussed in the preceding sections has related to the effects of white\nnoise (WN) on nonlinear systems\u2014effects that stem from the analysis pioneered by Einstein\n(1905) and Smoluchowski (1906). However, as previously remarked, WN is an idealization.\nIn the real world, noise is seldom white. (Recall that, even in WN experiments, the WN has\nto be replaced by exponentially correlated noise (ECN) whose correlation time is very short\ncompared to all characteristic times of the system under study.) It is, therefore, necessary\nto establish what happens when the noise is coloured , i.e. has a power spectrum that cannot\nbe considered to be flat within the frequency range of interest.\nIn the last decade there have been many attempts to investigate the effects induced by\nnon-white noises. The majority of these have been devoted to ECN, and often this very\nspecific type of noise has been referred to just as \u2018coloured noise\u2019. Detailed reviews of the\nearlier work can be found in the articles by Sancho and San Miguel (1989), Lindenberg et al\n(1989a, b), Grigolini (1989), Ha\u00a8nggi (1989), Brand et al (1989) and Dykman and Lindenberg\n(1994). The noise colour significantly enriches the fluctuation dynamics, particularly where\nthe characteristic correlation time of the noise is not small compared to the relaxation time\nof the system. In many physical situations, however, the driving noise is more complicated\nthan ECN. In particular, its power spectrum may be peaked near some characteristic\nfrequency or frequencies, and it is obviously important to investigate whether and how\nsuch structure may influence the response of the system. In fact, it would be reasonable to\nsave the term \u2018coloured\u2019 just for such a noise, as the most common example of it is the\nincoherent electromagnetic field of light with a given colour. In what follows we call it\nquasimonochromatic noise (QMN).\nThe occurrence of unusual effects in fluctuations of systems driven by quasimonochro-\nmatic noise was predicted, and many of these effects were analysed in Dykman (1990). We\nwill now discuss the effects of QMN and their observation through analogue simulations.\n6.1. Quasimonochromatic noise and its generation\nThe simplest form of the QMN is the noise with the power spectrum (Dykman 1990)\n8.!\/ D 40D\n.!2 \u2212 !20\/2 C 402!2\n0 \u001c !0: (117)\nSuch noise corresponds to fluctuations of the coordinate of an harmonic oscillator of\nfrequency !0\nRf .t\/C 20 Pf .t\/C !20f .t\/ D \u0018.t\/ (118)\ndriven by white noise \u0018.t\/ with correlator\nh\u0018.t\/\u0018.t 0\/i D 40D\u000e.t \u2212 t 0\/: (119)\nFollowing traditional notations, we define the noise power spectrum (117) without the factor\nof 2\u0019 used in (53) for the spectral density of fluctuations of a dynamical system. In cases\nwhere the noise originates from a coupling between the oscillator and a heat bath, the\ncharacteristic noise intensity D represents the temperature. Note that the noise with the\n  85\nspectrum (117) is also called harmonic noise (Igarashi and Munakata 1988, Ebeling and\nSchimansky-Geier 1989, Schimansky-Geier and Zu\u00a8licke 1990), usually referring to a range\nwhere 0 and !0 are of the same order of magnitude; we shall reserve QMN to describe the\nlimit 0 \u001c !0 where some of the most interesting new effects occur. Fluctuations of this\ngeneral type are seen in a wide variety of physical systems, for example off-shore structures\nsubject to waves, systems coupled to localized vibrations, in solids or large molecules.\nThe power spectrum (117) of QMN, plotted in figure 46 for a particular choice of\nparameters, is obviously very different from that of WN, which would be flat, or of ECN,\nwhich would decrease with frequency ! as .1 C !2\u001c 2c \/\u22121, where \u001cc is the correlation time\nof the noise. Not surprisingly, therefore, the effect of QMN on physical systems can\nbe very different from that of WN or of ECN, and has been shown to possess some\ndistinctive features (Dykman 1990, Dykman et al 1991b, 1993e, Millonas and Dykman\n1994, Einchcomb and McKane 1995). This is especially true in relation to bistable systems,\nincluding the simplest one, the symmetrical overdamped system\nPx C U 0.x\/ D f .t\/ U.x\/ D \u2212 12x2 C 14x4 (120)\nthat we have already considered in several different contexts. Analogue techniques are in\nmany ways ideal for investigating problems involving QMN because they cope relatively\neasily with the widely differing time scales involved. Circuit models of the type described\nabove can be used. The only differences from the methods discussed previously are that\nthe driving noise must of course be QMN rather than WN and that, as we shall see, it\nis sometimes necessary to analyse the x.t\/ data in a different way. The necessary QMN\nis readily created experimentally by \u2018filtration\u2019 of quasi-white noise through an harmonic\noscillator. A suitable circuit (Dykman et al 1993e) is sketched in figure 47. In this example,\nthe integrators had equal time constants \u001cI D R3C1 D R2C2 D 1 ms. Because the quasi-\nwhite input noise \u0018.t\/ had a correlation time \u001cN D 4:53 \u0016s \u001c \u001cI, it was perceived by the\ncircuit as white, with characteristic intensity\nD D 1\n20\nhV 2Ni\u001cN\n\u001cI\n(121)\nwhere hV 2Ni was the mean-square ECN noise voltage at the input. The output f .t\/ from\nthe circuit was QMN with the spectrum (117). Its parameters were nominally given by the\nFigure 46. A typical power spectral density 8.!\/ for quasimonochromatic noise (QMN), as\ngiven by (117).\n86\nFigure 47.

Transitions in a bistable potential\nFluctuational transitions between the stable states x D \u00061 of the system (120) occur under\nQMN in a manner quite different from those under WN as discussed in section 3, where it\nwas sufficient to reach the saddle point for the transition to happen with probability \u00181=2.\nIt was shown theoretically (Dykman 1990), and is also depicted in figure 48(a), that under\nQMN the excursions of the coordinate can go far beyond the potential barrier top (PBT)\nwithout the system leaving the potential well in which it started. This characteristic feature\nof QMN-driven systems was demonstrated (Dykman et al 1991b, 1993a) with an analogue\nelectronic model of (120). Two samples of the fluctuating voltage in the circuit representing\nx.t\/ in (120) are shown in figure 48(b). They correspond to fluctuations about the stable\nstates x1 D \u22121 and x2 D 1 and each exhibits occasional large fluctuations. It is apparent\nthat in the course of such fluctuations x.t\/ crosses the boundary point xtop D 0 several times\nforwards and backwards, and then goes back to the initially occupied state without making\na transition. Paths culminating in transitions to the other state are very much less frequent.\nThis behaviour can be understood intuitively (Dykman 1990) by noticing that, for\n!0 \u001d 0, the coordinate x.t\/ mostly performs fast random oscillations at the frequency\n!0, with an amplitude that varies relatively slowly, over the time \u00180\u22121. However, for a\ntransition to occur, it is necessary for the centre of oscillations to leave the first potential\nwell and cross the central potential maximum; it is not sufficient just for x.t\/ to do so. The\npicture becomes particularly simple provided the characteristic time scales of the motion\nare widely separated\n0 \u001c t\u22121r \u001c !0 (123)\nwhere tr is the relaxation time of the system (tr D 12 in the case of (120)).

The coordinate\noscillates (arrowed bold curve) with amplitude 2xC about a centre of motion x.ad\/c , and can pass\nthe potential barrier top (PBT) on each cycle without making a transition out of the initially\noccupied potential well. (b) Two samples of x.t\/ measured with D D 192 for the analogue\nelectronic circuit model of (117), (118) and (120), exhibiting an example of an occasional large\nfluctuation from each of the attractors that fails to produce an inter-well transition (Dykman et\nal 1991b).\none can deduce that, in the spirit of the averaging method of Arnol\u2019d (1978), the motion of\nthe centre of oscillations xc.t\/ may be regarded as occurring within a smoothed potential\nV .xc; xC; x\u2212\/ \u0011 12\u0019\nZ 2\u0019\n0\nd U.xc C xC ei C x\u2212 e\u2212i \/ \u0019 !02\u0019\nZ 2\u0019=!0\n0\nU.x.t\/\/ dt: (125)\nFor the quartic potential (120) the smoothed potential (125) is given by the expression\nV .xc; xC; x\u2212\/ D \u2212 12x2c C 14x4c C 3x2cx2C (126)\nplus terms independent of xc.\nThe amplitude of the oscillations (i.e. the amplitude of the random force f .t\/) varies\nover the time \u00180\u22121. Therefore, if the relaxation time of the system is much less than\n0\u22121, the centre of oscillations will follow variations in the amplitude of the oscillations\nadiabatically, so that it always remains at the minimum of the effective potential V (125),\n@V\n@xc\nD 0: (127)\nThe full curves of figure 49 show how V varies with xc for five values of xC. The heavy-\ndashed curve represents the equilibrium value of xc as given by (127), and the light-dashed\ncurves represent the extreme limits of oscillation xc \u2212 2xC, xc C 2xC.\nIt is interesting to note that, as the amplitude of the oscillations increases from zero,\nthe lower limit xc \u2212 2xC moves at first towards lower x but then, at x D \u2212\np\n5=3 \u0019 \u22121:29,\n88\nFigure 49.

One would expect this feature (Dykman 1990)\nto lead to the appearance of a singular point in the stationary probability distribution P.x\/,\na prediction to which we will return in section 6.3.\nMean escape rates T between the two potential wells have been measured (Dykman\net al 1993e) for the QMN-driven model, yielding the results shown in figure 50. They are\nplotted as ln T against D\u22121 for comparison with the theoretical expression\nT \/ exp.Rit=D\/ (128)\nwith Rit D !20=30 for (120) (Dykman 1990). The analogue data (pluses) lie on a straight\nline to an excellent approximation. For the two sets of parameters used, the gradients were\nfound to be: Rit D 1600 for !0 D 9:81, 0 D 0:021; and Rit D 719 for !0 D 9:95,\n0 D 0:045. These results are to be compared with the theoretical predictions of 1528 and\n733, respectively, with which they agree within experimental error. The results were also\nconfirmed by digital simulations (crosses). It is interesting to note that Rit is substantially\nlarger than the activation energy required to reach the PBT: the probability of reaching\nthe PBT exceeded the transition probability by a factor of approximately 100, thereby\nemphasizing one of the major differences between QMN and WN, for which the factor\nwould be two.\n6.3. The stationary distribution\nFrom the picture of random motion of the QMN-driven system as fast oscillations\nsuperimposed on the slow drift of their centre (cf figure 49), it is possible to infer the form\nof the probability distribution. At a given x, this distribution is determined, to logarithmic\naccuracy, by the probability density for an oscillating coordinate to reach this x as the\namplitude of fluctuational vibrations increases. For very small fluctuations (compared to\n  89\nFigure 50. Dependence of the mean escape time hT i on the noise strength D, plotted for\ncomparison with (128). The pluses and crosses represent analogue and digital simulations,\nrespectively, for: (a) !0 D 9:81, 0 D 0:021; (b) !0 D 9:95, 0 D 0:045. The straight lines are\nfits to the analogue data (Dykman et al 1993e).\nthe distance to the saddle point), the extremes of the motion x.t\/ (light-dashed curve) are\napproximately symmetrical about the stable state at x D \u22121 (where we assume the system to\nbe localized initially). As the fluctuation amplitude increases, however, the hardening of the\npotential V for the centre of oscillations for xc < \u22121, and its softening for xc > \u22121, cause\njxcj to decrease. Eventually, the latter effect dominates the evolution of the lower extreme\n\u22122jxCj C xc of the oscillating x.t\/ and this extreme passes its limiting value and starts to\nincrease. With further increase in the oscillation amplitude, the minimum in V .xc\/ becomes\nshallower and moves towards xc D 0. For the oscillation amplitude 2jxCj D .2=3\/1=2\nthis minimum reaches xc D 0 and sticks there (and so does xc), so that the motion with\nhigher amplitudes just consists of vibrations symmetrically distributed about xc D 0. The\nextremes of the motion will increase equally towards positive and negative x with increasing\nfluctuation amplitude, as shown in the latter case by the abrupt change in slope of the light-\ndashed curve on the left of figure 49. One would expect to see a corresponding change in\nthe gradient of the logarithm of the probability distribution P.x\/ at the point where reaching\nx via oscillations about xc \u0019 \u22121 is replaced by that via oscillations about xc D 0.\nWithout going into the full quantitative theory of the shape of the probability distribution\nwe can put these ideas onto a more quantitative basis by noticing that, according to\nequation (118), the distribution of the amplitude 2jfCj of the vibrations of the force\n90\nf .t\/ \u0019 fC.t\/ exp.i!0t\/C CC is Gaussian,\nPf .jfCj\/ \u0019 constant\u0002 exp.\u22122!20jfCj2=D\/: (129)\nOn the other hand, the amplitude of the fast oscillations of the coordinate xC is related to fC\njust by the expression xC D fC=i!0, which immediately follows from the equation of motion\nwith account taken of the fact that the frequency !0 exceeds all dynamical frequencies of\nthe system. Therefore, the distribution over xC has a form\nP.jxCj\/ \/ exp.\u22122!40jxCj2=D\/: (130)\nWhen the system reaches the point x, which for definiteness we consider to be the left-hand\nlimit of motion in the left-hand potential well, then\nx D xc \u2212 2xC: (131)\nThe position of the centre of oscillations is related to the amplitude jxCj by the adiabatic\ncondition (127), giving\nxc.\u22121C x2c C 6x2C\/ D 0 (132)\nwhich has three real solutions for xc when .1 \u2212 6x2C\/ > 0. The range of validity of each\nsolution is determined by demanding that the stationary point of the smoothed potential\n(126) be a minimum, @2V=@x2c > 0. Thus, we obtain\nxc D\n8<:\u2212\nq\n1\u2212 6x2C (xC <\np\n1=6)\n0 (xC >\np\n1=6)\n(133)\nas the explicit expression for the heavy-dashed curve in figure 49.

Clearly, this distribution displays a discontinuity at x D \u2212p5=3, which is\nthe analogue of the caustic-related discontinuities in white-noise-driven systems discussed\nin section 3. The related switching of optimal paths is discussed in section 6.4.\nThe non-analytic behaviour of the probability distribution was obtained in the double-\nadiabatic approximation where the vibrations of the system follow adiabatically the\nvibrations of the random force, and the position of the centre of oscillations follows\nadiabatically the instantaneous value of the vibration amplitude. If the latter approximation\nis weakened and non-adiabatic corrections in the parameter 0tr are taken into account, the\nsquare-root singularity of the logarithm of the probability distribution is replaced by a steep\nfunction, which was obtained by Dykman et al (1991b, 1993e) to the lowest order in 0tr\nand is shown by curve (c) in figure 51.\nSome analogue experimental results are plotted for comparison with theory in figure 51.\nCurve (a) represents the simplest version of the theory, leading to the singularity in lnP.x\/\ndiscussed above. Curve (b) shows the experimental measurements showing that indeed\nthere is no singularity but, rather, a region where lnP.x\/ is extremely steep compared to\nthe equivalent results for driving by WN (Dykman et al 1993e). These data are in good,\nalthough not perfect, agreement with curve (c) representing the non-adiabatic theory. For\nlarger negative values of x, the gradient of jlnP j evidently decreases again. The crossover\nfrom larger to smaller slope of jlnP j occurs in a narrow region around a switching point\n  91\nFigure 51.

It is naturally\nassociated with the fact that for jxj > jxswj the distribution is formed by fluctuations that\nfirst drive xc to the point xc D 0 and then continue to increase in the amplitude so that\neventually a given point x is encountered by fluctuational vibrations about xc D 0 (Dykman\n1990). The dependence of lnP on x in this range is given by equations (130) and (134).\n6.4. Large fluctuations and observation of a switching point\nAs discussed above in section 3, a powerful method of investigating large occasional\nfluctuations is to examine their prehistory by building the probability distribution of paths\nending at the point of interest (Dykman et al 1992c). In applying this technique, we ask\nthe question: if a rare fluctuation carries the system to a final point xf at a time tf , what\nis the probability that it passed through a point x at time t? The answer is given by the\nprehistory probability distribution ph.x; tI xf ; tf \/; usually, for convenience, we set tf D 0\nas before.\nThe method used for the measurement of ph.x; tI xf ; 0\/ in an experimental system\nfluctuating under WN was described in section 3. However, as we mentioned, the original\ntheoretical formulation of the prehistory problem (Dykman et al 1992c) applies irrespective\nof the type of noise. In the case of QMN we are primarily interested in the motion of\nthe centre of oscillations xc, rather than in the oscillations themselves, and therefore it is\nparticularly convenient to adopt an approach in which the prehistory of xc is followed.\nRespectively, successive realizations of x.t\/ are examined until one is found that arrives at\nxf . Taking this point as the zero of time (tf D 0) and working backwards, the path of the\ncentre of oscillations leading to the final point is recorded and added to the distribution.\nThe process then repeats, building up a prehistory distribution Ph.xc; tI xf ; t\/ of xc for that\nvalue of xf .\nFor values of xf lying well away from the switching point xsw the dependence of\nPh.xc; tI xf ; 0\/ on xf is smooth: a small variation of xf gives rise to a small change of\nthe optimal path of the centre of oscillations xc.t\/ along which the system arrives at xf ,\n92\nas the centre of oscillations remains close to the corresponding stable state xst D \u00061. One\nwould expect that this might no longer be true for the points xf lying on the other sides\nof xsw, because the corresponding paths should be topologically different: the points with\njxf j > jxswj are reached along paths where the centre of oscillations xc is brought first to the\npoint xc D 0 and then sticks to it while the amplitude of the vibrations about xc increases\nand eventually becomes equal to jxf j. The width of the range of xf where the switching\noccurs between the two types of path is proportional to the noise intensity and is therefore\nexpected to be small.\nThese theoretical arguments have been confirmed (Dykman et al 1995f) through\nanalogue electronic experiments. Some typical measurements of the prehistory probability\ndensity Ph.xc; tI xf ; 0\/ for xf close to the experimentally found value xsw \u0019 \u22121:5 are\nplotted in figure 52. For xf D \u22121:55 (figure 52(c)) the position of the centre of oscillations\nat the instant t D 0 of arrival at xf , and for some time before this arrival, lies with very\nhigh probability at xc D 0, in agreement with what has been said above. It can be seen from\nfigures 52(b) and (a), however, that the t D 0 peak corresponding to xc lying close to the\nstable position xst D \u22121 is growing rapidly with decreasing jxf j. There must clearly be a\ncritical value of xf (evidently of magnitude slightly smaller than 1.5\u2014this is in agreement\nwith the data in figure 51 where the change in slope occurs for jxj slightly less than 1.5),\nwhich we may identify with the switching point xsw, at which the integrated intensities of\nthe two t D 0 peaks at xc \u2019 xst D \u22121 and at xc D 0 will be equal. As xf moves away from\nxsw, the relative intensities of these peaks, and correspondingly the relative probabilities of\nthe two types of path, vary very rapidly as discussed above.\nYet another interesting feature of the prehistory probability density seen from figure 52\nconcerns the behaviour of Ph.xc; tI xf ; 0\/ for large jt j. The theoretical formulation of\nthe prehistory problem (Dykman et al 1992c) referred to the case where the probability\nof reaching a small vicinity of the given state from the corresponding metastable state\nwas larger than the probability of switching between the states. Therefore, when the\ntrajectory of the system was traced back in time it would approach, over the relaxation\ntime or the correlation time of noise (0\u22121, in the present case), whichever is larger, the\nvicinity of the metastable state. However, if the trajectory is traced further backward in\ntime, up to the times exceeding the reciprocal rates of interstate transitions, one would\nfind that eventually the prehistory probability density goes over into the full stationary\ndistribution of the system, rather than the quasistationary distribution about the appropriate\nmetastable state. This is precisely what happens in the system under consideration for\njxf j < jxswj.\nThe situation is different for jxf j > jxswj. In this case the probability of reaching a\ngiven xf is less than the probability of transitions between the stable states (Dykman 1990).\nTherefore, prior to reaching a point xf the system, whichever stable state it occupied initially,\nwill have become equally distributed over the both states, and the fluctuation that brought\nit to xf might have started in either of these states. This is, of course, a consequence of\nthe symmetry. However, it is clear that the prehistory probability density Ph.xc; tI xf ; 0\/\nshould immediately start splitting with increasing jt j into two peaks that correspond to\nsmall-amplitude fluctuations about the stable states, as observed (instead of remaining a\nsingle peak over the time \u00180\u22121 and then splitting into the two peaks due to the inter-well\ntransitions). There is also a small central peak at xc D 0 seen in figures 51(a)\u2013(c) which\nreflects a comparatively large probability of fluctuations bringing the centre of oscillations\nto x D 0; this peak arises from the competition between a large prefactor and a small\nexponential factor in the occupation probability of the state, and it diminishes rapidly with\ndecreasing noise intensity.\n  93\n(a) (b)\n(c)\nFigure 52.

Deterministic nonlinear phenomena\nThe phenomena discussed above have all been stochastic in character and, arguably,\nit is under these conditions that the analogue technique is at its most effective and\npowerful. One reason is that extraneous noise generated by active components such as\nmultipliers or operational amplifiers usually has an insignificant effect compared to the\nexternal noise applied to the model (although there are exceptions, cf Mannella et al 1986).\nAnalogue models have also, however, been used to investigate a wide range of deterministic\nphenomena, including a pioneering investigation of human heart rate variability (Van der Pol\nand Van der Mark 1928), hopping between strange attractors as a possible explanation of 1=f\n94\nnoise (Arecchi and Lisi 1982), chaos in driven nonlinear oscillators (Holmes 1979, Linsay\n1981, Testa et al 1982) and in the Lorenz system (Robinson 1990), multiperiodic orbits in\na pendulum with a vertically oscillating pivot (Smith and Blackburn 1994), synchronized\nchaos in coupled oscillators (Heagy et al 1994), modulation-induced negative differential\nresistance (Dow et al 1987, Gwaki et al 1993) and zero-dispersion nonlinear resonance\n(Luchinsky et al 1996a, 1997). We now consider the latter two cases, as examples.\n7.1. Modulation-induced negative differential resistance\nModulation-induced negative differential resistance (MINDR) was first observed, by chance,\nin an analogue electronic model; only later was it explained and discussed theoretically (Dow\net al 1987). It arises in damped bistable systems when driven by a multiplicative periodic\nforce: a parameter regime exists within which the response amplitude decreases with\nincreasing drive amplitude, and it is this counter-intuitive effect that constitutes MINDR.\nThe phenomenon is at its most pronounced in overdamped, deterministic, bistable systems,\nbut it is also robust in the presence of moderate levels of noise and inertia (Gwaki et al\n1993). MINDR was discovered in the cubic bistable system\nPx D \u2212x3 C \u0015.t\/x2 \u2212Qx C R (135)\nwith the constants Q D 3 and R D 0:7.

The dashed curves in figures 53(a) and (b) show what happens when\nthe square-wave modulation is replaced with a sine wave: MINDR is again evident, but the\neffect is weaker.\nMINDR has been analysed in detail by Lambert (Dow et al 1987) in the extreme limit\nof large-amplitude, high-frequency, modulation, such that\nV0!1 \u001c ! 0 12V0\u001c D \u0016 (143)\nwhere \u0016 is finite.

In this limit, \u001c is effectively just a scaling factor for the drive amplitude V0.\nThese universal functions have been calculated (Dow et al 1987). The results were\ngeneralized to describe the response to a periodic force of arbitrary form through the\nintroduction as a coefficient of castellation \u000f that gives a measure of the departure from\na square-wave shape: for a square wave, \u000f D 0. MINDR is difficult to treat analytically in\nthe presence of noise, or where there is an inertial term in the equation of motion. Digital\ntechniques have been used, however, to show that the phenomenon persists in the presence\n96 \nof moderate inertia and noise, but that it can be destroyed if they become too large (Gwaki \net al 1993).\n7.2. Zero-dispersion nonlinear resonance\nZero-dispersion nonlinear resonance (ZDNR) is an interesting phenomenon that can occur\nin a periodically-driven underdamped oscillator whose eigenfrequency (without the driving\nforce, and in the absence of damping) possesses one or more extrema as a function of\nenergy, i.e. the same kind of oscillator that can exhibit noise-induced spectral narrowing\n(Dykman et al 1990b), zero-dispersion peaks (Soskin 1989, 1992, Stocks et al 1993c)\nand zero-dispersion stochastic resonance (Stocks et al 1992, and see section 4.4). Many\nreal physical systems including, for example, SQUIDs (Barone and Paterno 1982, Kautz\n1996), relativistic oscillators (Kim and Lee 1995, Luchinsky et al 1996b), electrical\ncircuits (Hayashi 1964), and polymeric molecules, are of this type. ZDNR was discovered\ntheoretically by Soskin (1994) for a zero-dispersion oscillator in the absence of damping,\nand was subsequently observed experimentally and described theoretically for a weakly\ndissipative system (Luchinsky et al 1996a). The status of research on ZDNR has been\nsummarized by Soskin et al (1997). The phenomenon has some features that, at first sight,\nare rather surprising. For example, there can be a strong response to the external driving\nforce even in the absence of matching between the driving frequency and any eigenfrequency\nof the (undriven, undamped) system. An analogue electronic model has been used both to\ndemonstrate and investigate the phenomenon. In particular, its bifurcation diagram in the\nplane of the driving force parameters has been constructed by locating the transition lines\nseparating different regimes of behaviour.\nTo understand the physical origins of ZDNR, we take as an example a one-dimensional\npotential system subject to a weak linear friction and a weak periodic force, such that\nPx D p Pp D \u2212dU.x\/\ndx\n\u2212 0p C h cos.!f t\/: (146)\nOur goals will be to find period-1 orbits and to describe the transition regimes. (Note that\nhigher-order resonances can be treated in a similar way.) With these aims, we transform to\nthe slow variables action I and phase difference Q D  \u2212 !f t between the force and the\nresponse; we neglect high-frequency oscillatory terms. Then (146) can be reduced to\nPI D \u2212hx1 sin. Q \/\u2212 0I PQ D ! \u2212 !f \u2212 dx1dI h cos.\nQ \/ (147)\nwhere ! \u0011 !.I\/ is the eigenfrequency corresponding to I , and x1 is the first harmonic in\nthe Fourier expansion of x:\nx \u0011 q.I;  \/ D 2\n1X\nnD0\nxn.I \/ cos.n \/: (148)\nThe period-1 orbits are located by finding the stationary solutions of (147) with non-zero\naction. These can be of two types\nQ st D \u2212arcsinf0Ist=[hx1.Ist\/]g (149)\nQ st D arcsinf0Ist=[hx1.Ist\/]g \u2212 \u0019 (150)\nwhere Ist satisfies the equation\n!.Ist\/\u2212 !f D \u0006hdx1.Ist\/dIst\n\u0012\n1\u2212\n\u0012\n0Ist\nhx1.Ist\/\n\u00132\u00131=2\n(151)\n  97\nFigure 54. The typical dependence of (! \u2212 !f ) on the action I for a system with a minimum\nin !.E\/ (full curve), and solutions of (149) for stationary actions. The dotted curve represents\n\u0006hx01[1 \u2212 .0I=hx1\/2]1=2. The intersections corresponding to stable points (attractors) and\nunstable ones (saddles) are labelled S1\u2013S3 and U1 and U2, respectively (Luchinsky et al 1996a).\nin which the plus and minus refer to (149) and (150), respectively. Equation (151) can be\nsolved explicitly for very small h, or numerically for larger h: see figure 54. It is clear\nfrom inspection that, just as in the dissipationless case (Soskin 1994), there will be a range\nof !f for which the extremum of the full curve comes above the abscissa (! D !f ) line\nbut still intersects the upper dashed curve near Im, i.e. a large-amplitude response can exist\neven if !f is beyond the spectrum of eigenfrequencies.\nFor further analysis, we turn to an example (Dykman et al 1990b) of a simple\nquartic single-well potential whose dependence of eigenfrequency on energy possesses an\nextremum,\nU.x\/ D 1\n2\n!20x\n2 C 1\n3\n\fx3 C 1\n4\n\u03b3 x4\n9\n10\n<\n\f2\n\u03b3!20\n< 4: (152)\nNote that, although the U.x\/ considered by Dykman et al (1990b) contained a linear term,\nit is reducible to (152) by a suitable change of variable. For (152) with !0 D 1, \f D 5=3,\n\u03b3 D 1, there is a minimum in !.I\/: !m D 0:805; Im D 0:187; !00m \u0011 d2!.Im\/=dI 2m D 10:5;\nx1m \u0011 x1.Im\/ D 0:325. Figure 55 shows the bifurcation diagram in the plane of the\ndriving force parameters for 0 D 0:011. Its structure is typical of that expected for any\nsystem with an extremum in eigenfrequency as a function of energy (or action). The data\npoints represent measurements on an analogue model of (146) and (152) of similar design\nto those already described. The theoretical curves were obtained from the condition that\ncurves corresponding to the left-hand and right-hand sides of (149) touch rather than cross\neach other (cf figure 54). They are in good agreement with the experimental data. Within\nthe region bounded by the full curves (except very close to the cusps of the full curves),\npoint S1 in figure 54 is well separated in action from S2=S3. The response corresponding\nto S2=S3 is always strongly nonlinear. The response corresponding to S1 is linear in\nthe region far below the upper full curve. It starts to be nonlinear when closer to the\nline but even then it is still significantly smaller than S2=S3; in order to distinguish S1\nfrom S2=S3, we shall refer to it as \u2018linear\u2019 within the whole region bounded by the full\ncurves.\nThe evolution of the phase space of the slow parameters as !f increases for fixed h is of\nparticular interest, and has been calculated numerically as shown in figure 56. One can see\n98\nFigure 55. The bifurcation diagram in the plane of the driving force parameters for (146) and\n(152) with !0 D \u03b3 D 1:0, \f D 5=3, 0 D 0:011 (the normalization of the vertical axis is\nx1m=.0Im\/ D 159:0). Full curves bound the region within which both the linear (S1) and one\nor both of the nonlinear (S2, S3) responses can exist: the upper curve (theory) and triangles\n(analogue electronic simulation) mark the boundary of the linear response, and the lower curve\nand squares mark that for the nonlinear responses. Dashed curves bound the region where both\nnonlinear responses (S2, S3) coexist: the upper dashed curve (theory) and circles (simulation)\nmark the boundary for the lower action attractor (S2), and the lower dashed curve and diamonds\nmark that for the larger action attractor (S3). The calculated ZDNR=NR transition is shown by\nthe dotted curve. The inset provides an enlarged plot of the region near the cusp (Luchinsky\net al 1996a).\na distinct difference in the structure of the BAs of the nonlinear responses at different !f .\nAt smaller !f (figures 56(a) and (b)), the phase difference between attractor and saddle (the\nouter saddle, in cases where the BA has two saddles) for each BA is negligible, whereas\nfor larger !f (figures 56(c)\u2013(e)) it is of the same order as the characteristic width of the\nBA. This holds true throughout the whole region enclosed by the full curves in figure 55\n(except, very close to the bifurcation curves), the two types of behaviour being separated\nby the dotted curve. In analogy with the dissipationless case (Soskin 1994), the parameter\nranges to the left and right of the dotted curve can be consistently defined as the zero-\ndispersion (ZDNR) and conventional (NR) stages of nonlinear response (and the definition\ncan be formulated in a similar way for the original system (146) in terms of a stroboscopic\nPoincare\u00b4 section).\nIn the dissipationless case, the transition between the ZDNR and NR stages as parameters\nchange occurs (Soskin and Luchinsky 1995) through separatrix reconnection (Howard and\nHohs 1984), resulting in a different topology of separatrices between regions of trapped\nand untrapped motion: the separatrices are homoclinic or heteroclinic for ZDNR or NR,\nrespectively (Soskin 1994, Soskin and Luchinsky 1995). In the presence of dissipation,\nthe transition occurs typically via a saddle connection (Guckenheimer and Holmes 1983)\nas can be seen from figures 56(b) and (c). It also results in a change of topology of\nthe BAs of the nonlinear responses. Just before the bifurcation, at the ZDNR stage, the\nbasin of attraction (BA) corresponding to the larger action attractor (S3) encompasses the\nother one (S2), whereas the opposite applies for the NR stage just after the bifurcation:\nsee figures 55(b) and (c). Note that the transition can also occur continuously via a path\n  99\nFigure 56. Calculated evolution with driving frequency !f of the basins of attraction (BAs)\nof nonlinear responses in a 2\u0019 band of the phase space of the slow variables (I ordinate, Q \nabscissa) for the same system as in figure 55 but averaged over the high-frequency oscillations\n(equations (147) and (148)) for h D 0:0143 and: (a) !f D 0:8; (b) 0.83; (c) 0.85; (d) 0.88;\n(e) 0.92.

One can obtain the complete phase space by repeating the above\npicture with a period 2\u0019 in Q . (Luchinsky et al 1996a).\naround the central cusp point (figure 54, inset). Because the separation between the cusp\nand the lower full curve tends towards zero as 0! 0, however, this possibility can usually\nbe ignored. Beyond the close vicinity of the cusp, the frequency !.tr\/f of the ZDNR=NR\ntransition can be shown to satisfy an asymptotic (h ! 0) formula which is valid for the\n100\ngeneral case rather than for (152) only:\n!\n.tr\/\nf D !m C sgn.!00m\/.j!00mj=2\/1=3\n\u0014\n3\n2\nhx1m\n\u001a\n.1\u2212 \u00112\/1=2 \u2212 \u0011\n\u0012\n\u0019\n2\n\u2212 arcsin.\u0011\/\n\u0013\u001b\u00152=3\n(153)\n\u0011 \u0011 0Im\nhx1m\n< 1\n\u0014\n0\nj!00mjI 2m\n\u00152=3\n\u001c\n\u0014\n!\n.tr\/\nf \u2212 !m\n!00mI 2m\n\u00151=2\n\u001c 1:\nIt can be found more exactly by numerical solution of (147) (figure 54).\nThere is another non-trivial bifurcation that has no analogue in the dissipationless case:\nthe alternation between the BA of one attractor either encompassing the other one, or\nsimply moving around it (figures 55(c)\u2013(e)), as the frequency is changed (for smaller\n0, a similar alternation takes place at the ZDNR stage too). These bifurcations are of\nthe saddle connection type too and, together with the ZDNR=NR transition, they are\ncharacteristic of any oscillatory system whose variation of eigenfrequency with energy\npossesses an extremum. The ZDNR=NR and encompassing=moving around bifurcations\nare of particular interest because they may be expected to give rise to unusual fluctuational\nphenomena.\nOf course, in the presence of noise, previously stable states become metastable. Escape\nfrom an attractor takes place with overwhelming probability via one of the saddle points\nof its BA (Dykman and Krivoglaz 1979, Freidlin and Wentzell 1984). Thus, the transition\nof a saddle point from the BA of one nonlinear response to the other at the ZDNR=NR\nbifurcation would be expected to result in a jump-wise change in the probabilities of\nfluctuational transitions between the nonlinear and linear responses (in figures 56(b) and\n(c), the trajectory outgoing to the right from the saddle point with a lower action goes\nto the attractor corresponding to linear response): for ZDNR, just before the bifurcation,\nthere are no direct transitions between attractors S1 and S2, whereas, for NR, just after the\nbifurcation, there are no direct transitions between S1 and S3. A similar effect should occur\nat global bifurcations of the \u2018encompassing\/moving around\u2019 type. Note that these various\nchanges cannot be described in terms of frequency\u2013response curves (Hayashi 1964) because\nnothing happens to the attractors themselves at a global bifurcation.\nOne may expect that the sequence of global bifurcations undergone by a ZD oscillator\nshould manifest itself in some very unusual dependences of the fluctuational inter-attractor\ntransition probabilities on parameters of the driving force. They have yet to be studied\nin detail, but it is interesting to consider briefly stationary fluctuations in the system.\nIt can be shown that, for small enough h, there is a repopulation of the attractors\nassociated with the ZDNR=NR transition: during the ZDNR stage, the population of\nattractor S3 is bigger than that of S2, whereas it is the other way round for NR. As\ndiscussed by Luchinsky et al (1995), this repopulation produces corresponding changes in\nthe fluctuation spectra which are at their most pronounced for intermediate noise intensities\nand amplitudes of the driving force. The spectral density of fluctuations of the coordinate\nconsists typically of a narrow transition peak at the frequency of the driving force which\nis due to fluctuational transitions between the metastable states, Stokes and anti-Stokes\nbands which are due to small fluctuations around S2 and S3, and a comparatively broad\npeak at !0 caused by small fluctuations near S1 (cf Dykman and Krivoglaz 1979, 1984,\nDykman et al 1989). The repopulation of S2 and S3 reverses the relative amplitudes of\nthe Stokes and anti-Stokes bands and can also result in a rather unusual dependence of\nthe intensity of the transition peak on the frequency of the driving force: quite unlike\nthe case of the Duffing oscillator (Dykman et al 1994c), it can have a two-humped\nstructure.\n101\nStudies of ZDNR and associated phenomena are still in their infancy, and many puzzles\nremain to be resolved including, in particular, those associated with chaos (Neiman et al\n1995) and with fluctuational effects (Luchinsky et al 1995). It seems likely that the former\nwill be treated mainly via digital approaches, and the latter mainly via analogue experiments\nof the kind discussed in this review.\n8. Future directions\nThe examples discussed above are intended to convey some idea of the versatility,\nconvenience and power of analogue electronic modelling. Despite its simplicity, the\ntechnique can be applied to problems at the forefront of statistical mechanics (see, e.g.,\nsection 3) as well as to a wide range of applied research. It is of particular value on\noccasions when nonlinear dynamical systems are to be explored and their behaviour has to\nbe qualitatively understood over a wide range of parameters, for instance in the development\nof the Josephson junction voltage standard (Kautz 1996), analyses of the action potential\nin the giant axon of a squid (Starzak 1984), studies of chaotic behaviour in nonlinear\noscillators (see, e.g., references in section 1 and at the start of section 7), investigations\nof stochastic resonance (section 4) and the pilot experiments (section 4.6) preparing the\nway for studies of noise-enhanced optical heterodyning (Dykman et al 1995a). Given\nthat the technique needs only a small addition\u2014usually just a handful of standard cheap\nICs\u2014to the equipment already available in most laboratories, we suggest that it could\nwith advantage be applied much more widely, in undergraduate teaching as well as in\nresearch.\nWhat of the future? Well, in the long term, one can guess that the advantage in speed\nsometimes held by analogue over digital methods at the moment will probably disappear as\nprocessor speeds inexorably rise. Of course, the frequency responses and quality of analogue\ncomponents (e.g. multipliers) are also likely to improve, permitting faster operation of the\nanalogue models. Nonetheless, part of their present convenience lies in the possibility of\ncreating them on simple open mounting boards with pressure contacts, thereby setting an\neffective upper frequency limit of perhaps \u00181 MHz: at frequencies much higher than this\nstray capacitance and inductance, and phase shifts across the circuit, become important and\nvery careful component layout on a printed circuit board is then essential. However, there\nare good reasons to suppose that\u2014even without its present speed advantage\u2014the peculiar\nmerits of the analogue technique will ensure its continued use for the forseeable future in\nmany areas of science and technology. Of the features discussed in section 1, the most\nrelevant here is the close relationship to real experiments and the possibility to explore, in\nreal time and visually, a broad range of parameter values.\nIn the medium term, one can be confident in predicting that research on stochastic\nsystems of all kinds will continue to be extremely active in exploiting the advantages\nof analogue techniques. One of the fastest developing areas is the physics of large rare\nfluctuations (sections 3 and 6), which is still at a relatively early stage of its evolution,\nand where we forsee intense activity over the coming decade, with theory and experiment\nadvancing together in a mutually supportive way. Up to now, analogue models have\nconstituted the only experimental means of investigating the dynamics of large fluctuations:\nthe nonlinear dynamics of large fluctuations would probably not have reached its current\nstatus as a subject area without the possibility of observing optimal fluctuational paths,\ntogether with the singularities in their pattern, and the shape of the tube of fluctuational paths.\nIn addition to further intensive experimentation of a similar kind during the next few years,\nwe anticipate that optimal paths will also be observed and studied in natural systems\u2014using\n102\nideas and techniques, for example measurements of the prehistory probability distribution,\nalready developed and tested on the analogue models.\nImportant stochastic problems ripe for immediate investigation using the techniques\ndescribed above include, for example: the relationship between singularities of the pattern\nof optimal paths and theories of phase transitions, including the dynamics of soft modes near\ncritical points; the recently introduced theory of the logarithmic susceptibility (Dykman et al\n1997a, Smelyanskiy et al 1997b), which urgently requires experimental verification\/testing,\nespecially in the context of a variety of diverse applications, for example the selective control\nof diffusion by ac fields; and the characteristic behaviour expected near nascent cusp points\nof infinite codimension (Maier and Stein 1996a), including saddle-point avoidance and non-\nGaussian exit location distributions (section 3.3.3). Amongst applications of the basic ideas\nand results on fluctuating nonlinear systems are numerous biological problems, in addition\nto those representing applications of stochastic resonance (Bulsara et al 1995, Collins et al\n1995, 1996, Wiesenfeld and Moss 1995), that are already yielding, or likely to be amenable,\nto analogue approaches. They exist on all length\/complexity scales from the molecular\nlevel up to the complete organism. Examples include the old problem of the passage of\ncurrents through ion channels in a cell membrane (Eisenberg et al 1995, Eisenberg 1996a, b),\nBrownian ratchets (Astumian 1997), and the relationship between noise and chaos in the\nhuman cardiovascular system (Camm et al 1996).\nAnalogue modelling techniques of the kind described in this review seem certain to play\nan important role in the solution of these and of other problems, doubtless including many\nthat are as yet unformulated, in the years to come.\nAcknowledgments\nWe freely acknowledge our very considerable indebtedness to Riccardo Mannella,\nNorman Stein and Nigel Stocks, on the experimental side, and to the late\nMichael A Krivoglaz and to Vadim Smelyanskiy, on the theoretical side, as well as to\nmany other collaborators, including Manuel Arraya\u00b4s, Vladimir Chinarov, Xiaolin Chu,\nRichard Dow, Igor Fedchenia, Leo Fronzoni, Genadi-Petrovich Golubev, Paolo Grigolini,\nHermann Haken, Peter Ha\u00a8nggi, Werner Horsthemke, Hu Gang, Paul Hunt, Akito Igarashi,\nJan Iwaniszewski, Mark James, Igor Kaufman, Dilip Kondepudi, Colin Lambert,\nStuart Lawson, Richard Lee, Katja Lindenberg, Luigi Lugiato, Robert Maier, Paolo Martano,\nAlan McKane, Mark Millonas, Eugenia Mori, Frank Moss, Shura Neiman, Takehiko Norita,\nHerschel Rabitz, the late Hans Risken, Stuart Robinson, John Ross, Jose-Maria Sancho,\nHiroko Short, Slava Soskin, Daniel Stein, Alexander Velikovich and Boris Vugmeister.\nWithout their collaboration, the research described above could not have been undertaken.\nThe work has been supported in part by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research\nCouncil (UK), the Royal Society of London, the National Science Foundation (USA), the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the European Community, the International Science\nFoundation, INTAS and the Russian Foundation for Fundamental Research.\nReferences\nAnishchenko V S, Neiman A B and Safanova M A 1993 J.
