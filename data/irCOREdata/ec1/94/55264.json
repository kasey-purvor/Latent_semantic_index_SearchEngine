Introduction\n[2] The most pronounced feature of the Southern Ocean\ncirculation is the eastward flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar\nCurrent (ACC), which plays a crucial role in the global\nclimate system by connecting the major oceans and redis-\ntributing oceanic properties, such as heat, salt and nutrients\n[Rintoul et al., 2001]. This flow is also associated with a\nsteep rise of isopycnals toward the south through the entire\nwater column. This poleward rise of isotherms and isoha-\nlines is not uniform, but occurs in a series of clear step-like\npatterns. Between zones of relatively uniform water mass\nproperties lie bands of large horizontal density gradients\ncharacterizing the ACC fronts, which are associated with\nrelatively narrow, deep-reaching current cores and large\nsurface velocities [Nowlin et al., 1977; Nowlin and Clifford,\n1982; Nowlin and Klinck, 1986]. Understanding the struc-\nture and location of the major fronts of the Southern Ocean\nis of considerable importance because of their influence on\nclimate and ecosystem processes.\n[3] Using historical data, Orsi et al. [1995] and Belkin\nand Gordon [1996] were the first to map the circumpolar\ndistribution of the Southern Ocean fronts. From north to\nsouth, the fronts and zones of the Southern Ocean are:\nthe Subtropical Front (STF), Subantarctic Zone (SAZ),\nSubantarctic Front (SAF), Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ), Polar\nFront (PF), Antarctic Zone (AAZ), Southern ACC Front\n(SACCF), Southern Zone and the southern boundary of the\nACC (SB) [Whitworth, 1980; Orsi et al., 1995]. A variety of\ndefinitions based on water mass properties have been used\nto identify these fronts (see works of Orsi et al. [1995] and\nBelkin and Gordon [1996] for useful summaries of these\ndefinitions). However, the frontal properties are not uniform\nin all sectors of the Southern Ocean. The variations in\nfrontal structure from region to region and the multiplicity\nof definitions used by various authors have led to some\nconfusion in identifying particular fronts. In addition, many\nareas have remained relatively poorly sampled and in very\nfew locations have sufficient repeat measurements been\nmade to permit the variability of the fronts to be assessed.\nThese earlier studies were based on ship-based measure-\nments with their high accuracy and depth-resolving capa-\nbility, but these data are scarce in the Southern Ocean and\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, C09012, doi:10.1029\/2007JC004647, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1NERC Sea Mammal Research Unit, University of St. Andrews, St.\nAndrews, UK.\n2British Antarctic Survey, Natural Environment Research Council,\nCambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JC004647$09.00\nC09012 1 of 19\nare focused on the summer season on the basis of inherent\nlogistic difficulties.\n[4] Others studies [e.g., Gille, 1994; Moore et al., 1999;\nKostianoy et al., 2003] have also examined the time-varying\nfrontal locations on a circumpolar scale using satellite\nmeasurements. Indeed, the spatial and temporal resolution\nof the altimetric sea surface height (SSH) measurements\nused by e.g. Gille [1994] were coarse compared to other\nsatellite data. Moore et al. [1999] determined the surface PF\nlocation from weekly composites of the daily images of sea\nsurface temperature (SST) measured from satellite-borne\ninfrared sensors hampered by cloud cover. Dong et al.\n[2006] use the recently launched Advanced Microwave\nScanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System\n(AMSR-E), which provides global all-weather SST meas-\nurements, though with lower spatial resolution than more\ntraditional infrared SST. More recently, Sokolov and Rintoul\n[2007] used weekly maps of SSH to characterize the\nstructure and variability of the ACC fronts and filaments\nsouth of Australia.\n[5] The studies based on remote SST were limited to\nanalyses of fronts with a surface expression in SST and only\na few studies were able to collect in-situ data with a\nsufficient temporal resolution to investigate the frontal\nvariability using the subsurface expressions [Sokolov and\nRintoul, 2002; Thorpe et al., 2002; Meredith et al., 2003b;\nSokolov et al., 2006]. None of these studies describe the\nthree major fronts of the ACC (SAF, PF and SACCF)\nsimultaneously with good spatial and temporal coverage.\nSokolov and Rintoul [2007] are the first to describe the\nmultiple jets of the ACC associated with these three fronts\ntogether using weekly SSH maps. Here, we use a compre-\nhensive in-situ data set collected during 2004 and 2005 to\ndetermine the location, structure and variability of the three\nmajor fronts in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern\nOcean (Figure 1). We focus on data obtained by free-\ndrifting profiling floats seeded by the Argo project [Gould\net al., 2004] and complement these data with hydrographic\nprofiles recorded by animal-borne sensors.\n[6] Argo is a global array of autonomous profiling floats\nthat provides vertical profiles of salinity and temperature of\nthe upper 2000 dbar of the open ocean at 10-day intervals.\nThis array samples the seasons evenly, so the measurements\nare not biased toward seasons favorable for ship-based work\n[Gould et al., 2004]. Although the profiling float has\nenormous potential for broad-scale ocean observations, it\ndoes not provide a complete observational strategy. The\ncoverage of floats in the Southern Ocean is sparser than\nelsewhere especially the seasonally ice-covered regions.\n[7] Marine mammals, however, can help to overcome\nthese limitations and provide a complementary high-reso-\nlution data source [Boehme et al., 2008]. They can operate\ndeep in ice-covered regions [Lydersen et al., 2004] and\nanimal-borne sensors can accurately record hydrographic\ndata at high frequency and in near real-time from remote,\nrelatively inaccessible parts of the ocean [Lydersen et al.,\n2004; Charrassin et al., 2004; Bailleul et al., 2007; Biuw et\nal., 2007]. Autonomous CTD-Satellite Relay Data Loggers\n(CTD-SRDLs) can be attached to marine animals and report\nvertical profiles of salinity, temperature and pressure to a\ndepth of up to 2000 m. Enlisting marine animals as\nsampling platforms is not a new idea. The earliest published\nreference to this approach is from 1970 [Evans, 1970].\nHowever, until recently, no one had ever developed the\ntechnology to allow collection of high-quality CTD infor-\nmation. Nowadays, these instruments have the potential to\ncollect information about the oceans that is not only relevant\nto the study of the ecology of animals carrying the instru-\nments [e.g., Biuw et al., 2007], but also for studying the\nphysical structure of the oceans [Lydersen et al., 2002,\n2004; Charrassin et al., 2004; Boehme et al., 2008]. While\nCTD-SRDL measurements are neither regular in terms of\nspatial and temporal coverage (compared, for example, with\nsatellite measurements of oceanographic fields) nor com-\npletely random (such as those from drifting buoys), these\nstudies provide valuable in-situ information about the sub-\nsurface structure of the ocean. Accurate satellite positioning\nof diving marine animals, high-accuracy sensors, and the\npotential to collect large numbers of profiles cost-effectively\nmake these studies particularly important in regions where\ntraditional oceanographic measurements are scarce. CTD-\nSRDLs can be programmed to sample and transmit hydro-\ngraphic profiles on a daily basis and are therefore intrinsically\nan eddy-resolving device, rather than a broad-scale one.\nThe natural niche for CTD-SRDLs in the observing system\nis in providing complementary measurements of boundary\ncurrents and fronts, as well as coverage of undersampled\nocean basins. They thus provide a powerful complement to\nexisting methods rather than a replacement for them\n[Boehme et al., 2008]. Only by combining these two data\nsets, we are able to investigate the variability of the frontal\nsystem from Drake Passage to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge on\nshort temporal scales.\n[8] In this paper, we describe the characteristics of the\ncombined data set and methods we used to identify the SAF,\nPF and SACCF, including the optimal interpolation method\nused to calculate gridded fields of temperature on selected\npressure levels. Then, we use the gridded horizontal fields\nto determine the mean position and variability of the fronts.\nFinally we discuss the findings in the broader Southern\nOcean context.\n2. Data and Methods\n2.1. Hydrographic In-Situ Data\n[9] Between 2004 and 2005, more than 120 profiling\nfloats populated the southern South Atlantic Ocean as part\nof the Argo project. One disadvantage of sampling by\nautonomous floats is that most of the measurements are\nwithout accompanying ship-board data for absolute calibra-\ntion. This deficiency is especially problematic for salinity,\nas conductivity cells are prone to changes that can cause\nsensor drifts in float salinity measurements. Several meth-\nods for post-deployment quality control are available to\nadjust possible sensor drifts by comparison with ship-board\nCTD data or statistical estimates of background temperature\nand salinity relations [Wong et al., 2003; Boehme and Send,\n2005]. In this study, we only used profiles that passed the\nArgo real-time quality control, containing information on\ntheir position, date, temperature (T) and salinity (S) profiles,\nwith their first measurement point shallower than 20 m\n(Figure 2). We used either the delayed-mode data or, if not\navailable, we used the method of Boehme and Send [2005]\nto check the float salinity for any drifts.\nC09012 BOEHME ET AL.: THE ACC FRONTS IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC\n2 of 19\nC09012\n[10] Our CTD-SRDL data come from the SEaOS project\n(Southern Elephant Seals as Oceanographic Samplers), an\ninternational interdisciplinary program aimed at increasing\nour understanding of how Southern elephant seals interact\nwith their physical environment and also at demonstrating\nand implementing this cost-effective means of gathering\nroutine observations of hydrographic data from remote\nenvironments [Biuw et al., 2007; Boehme et al., 2008].\nFigure 1. Schematic of the southern South Atlantic (top) and the Scotia Sea (bottom). Some important\ntopographic features are marked: Meteor Rise (MR), Bouvet\u00f8ya (BV), South West Indian Ridge (SWIR),\nSouth Sandwich Islands (SSw), Falkland Ridge (FR), Falkland Trough (FT), Northwest Georgia Rise\n(NGR), Northeast Georgia Rise (NEGR), Shag Rocks Passage (SRP), Elephant Island (EI) and South\nShetland Islands (SSh). The 1000, 2000, and 3000 m isobaths are marked. The two solid lines show the\nextent of the ACC. The northern line corresponds to the SAF and the southern line to the SB from Orsi et\nal. [1995].\nC09012 BOEHME ET AL.: THE ACC FRONTS IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC\n3 of 19\nC09012\nDuring the SEaOS program, we used CTD-SRDLs, custom-\nbuilt by the Sea Mammal Research Unit, St Andrews, UK\nand Valeport Ltd., Devon, UK. We deployed 6 CTD-SRDLs\nand 2 temperature only SRDLs in 2004 and 13 CTD-SRDLs\nin 2005 at Husvik, South Georgia (54\u0001 110 S, 36\u0001 42.50 W).\nThe CTD-SRDLs were fixed harmlessly to seals\u2019 fur after\nthe elephant seals completed their annual moult in January\/\nFebruary. The CTD-SRDLs were set to ensure batteries\nlasted throughout as much of the winter migration as\npossible, ideally until seals returned to breed in September.\nDuring the animals\u2019 migration the CTD-SRDLs recorded\nand transmitted hydrographic profiles at a rate of approx-\nimately 2 profiles\/day to an average depth of about 560 m,\nrepresenting a combination of transect-type sections with a\nspatial resolution of 25\u201350 km along the migratory routes\nand mooring like data in the foraging areas of the seals\n[Biuw et al., 2007; Boehme et al., 2008]. The CTD-SRDLs\nwere finally lost, when the animals moulted again. In 2004\nand 2005, we obtained more than 8200 hydrographic\nprofiles to depths up to 2000 m, from the Drake Passage\nto east of the Mid-Atlanic Ridge (Figure 2).\n[11] CTD-SRDLs are checked in a calibration facility\nbefore deployment and these comparisons yield errors of\nless than 2 mK in temperature and less than 0.003 mS\/cm in\nconductivity leading to salinity values with an error up to\nabout 0.010 in the worst case scenario. Figure 3 shows\ndifferences between a ship-based CTD (SBE 911) and a\nCTD-SRDL, which was attached to the frame of the ship-\nbased instrument. Only data measured in a homogeneous\nlayer were used to compare both instruments. The differ-\nences in temperature are less than 5 mK and the resolution\nof the temperature data is obvious. The salinity data\nrecorded by the CTD-SRDL is also within 0.005 of the\nmeasurements taken by the SBE 911 (Figure 3). Such direct\ncomparisons between ship-based CTDs and CTD-SRDLs\nwere performed for some of the deployed instruments. In\norder to properly quantify possible sensor drifts during the\ndeployment with high accuracy, recovery of the CTD-\nSRDL and recalibration of its sensors would be necessary.\nHowever, since a recalibration is generally not possible on a\nroutine basis, CTD-SRDL data have to be checked in an\nindirect way. Again, a method similar to Boehme and Send\n[2005] has been created and implemented to compare the\nCTD-SRDL measurements with historical CTD data and\ncalibrated Argo float data to correct any sensor drifts and\npossible offsets in temperature and salinity (L. Boehme et\nal., unpublished data, 2008). All deployed CTD-SRDLs\nhave no sensor drift or offset in temperature during their\nlifetime, but the salinity measurements have often an offset\nin the order of 0.1, which is traced back to the influence of\nthe seals head on the external field of the inductive cell. All\ndata were checked and corrected for such offset. This post-\ndeployment quality control adds an uncertainty to the data\nset, which is typically in the order of 0.005 in salinity [Wong\net al., 2003; Boehme and Send, 2005], but can be higher in\ndata sparse regions (L. Boehme et al., unpublished data,\n2008). Hence we have to add an uncertainty to the data, but\nexpect the CTD-SRDL data to be better than 0.02 in\nFigure 2. Spatial distribution of Argo float data (top) and CTD-SRDL data (bottom) in the years 2004\n(red) and 2005 (blue).\nC09012 BOEHME ET AL.: THE ACC FRONTS IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC\n4 of 19\nC09012\ntemperature and salinity, which is of at least the same\nquality as XBT data [Boyd and Linzell, 1993].\n[12] Figure 2 shows the complementarity of the two data\nsets (Argo and CTD-SRDLs), especially in the area between\nSouth Georgia and the Mid-Atlanic Ridge. These two data\nsources produce a data set with a temporal and spacial\nresolution, which were previously unavailable. This data set\nincludes up to 1000 hydrographic profiles per month\n(Figure 4), of which CTD-SRDLs contribute up to 90%.\nFigure 4 shows a reduction in the number of monthly\nprofiles, when the CTD-SRDLs stopped working between\nSeptember and December each year. The spatial resolution\nof each subset also changed from less than 20 km to more\nthan 60 km, when less profiles were present. With reference\nto Figure 4, it can be seen that the Argo float data provide\nthe background field, and the CTD-SRDL data are used to\nincrease the temporal and spatial resolution of the data set,\nyet the only source of data between the South Sandwich\nIslands and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Figure 2).\n[13] This combined data set was then used to generate\ngridded horizontal potential temperature (Q) fields on\npressure levels using an optimal interpolation scheme sim-\nilar to the one introduced by Boehme and Send [2005]\n(see Appendix). For all calculations we used a 0.4\u0001 \u0002 0.25\u0001\ngrid (\u000325 km) from 80\u0001W to 15\u0001E and 63\u0001S to 40\u0001S at\n200 dbar, 300 dbar and 500 dbar pressure. We also\ncalculated Q of the temperature minimum layer closest to\nthe surface. All data without any temporal separation were\nused to investigate the mean field of the two year period\nfrom 2004 to 2005. For the monthly temperature fields we\nused the detected temporal scale t (see Appendix). For each\nmonthly field, all available data of the two year period were\nused, but each measurement was also weighted by t (see\nAppendix) centered around the middle of the specific\nmonth. Hence the data coverage is the same for the mean\nfield and each monthly field, but when sufficient data in\ntime were available, the monthly fields reflects these data\nand such regions deviate from the mean field [Boehme and\nSend, 2005]. This fall back on the mean field, when no data\nclose in time is available, is rather underestimating any\nvariations from the meanfield and will result in little\nvariation between monthly maps in regions with few\nprofiles.\n2.2. Sea Surface Temperature\n[14] We also used an optimally interpolated daily, quarter\ndegree (\u00b125 km) SST product (http:\/\/www.ssmi.com). This\nproduct is computed by a combination of two satellites, the\nTRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) and NASDA\u2019s Advanced\nMicrowave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E). TMI\nand AMSR-E observations are used to retrieve SST and this\ncombination provides nearly complete global coverage each\nday. The accuracy of this SST is of the order of \u00b10.5\u0001C\n[Gentemann et al., 2004]. Two years (January 2004 to\nDecember 2005) of daily SST observations are used in this\nstudy. Following Moore et al. [1999] and Dong et al.\n[2006], we used the daily SST data to calculate the\nstandard deviation of SST and derived the mean SST\ngradient dSST =\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\ndT=dx\u00f0 \u00de2\u00fe dT=dy\u00f0 \u00de2\nq\nincluding its stan-\ndard deviation at the frontal positions derived from the\nhydrographic data.\nFigure 3. Differences in temperature (left) and salinity (right) of a CTD-SDRL and a ship-based CTD.\nThe CTD-SRDL was attached to the frame of the ship-based instrument. Only measurements taken in a\nhomogeneous water mass are used.\nFigure 4.

Sea Level Anomaly\n[15] Satellite altimeter sea level anomaly (SLA) data were\nobtained from AVISO on a 1\/3\u0001 Mercator grid at 7 day\nintervals [Ducet et al., 2000]. These are multimission\ngridded sea surface heights computed with respect to a\nseven-year mean and consist of processed data from differ-\nent altimeter missions (Jason-1, T\/P, ENVISAT, GFO,\nERS1\/2 and GEOSAT). Combining data from different\nmissions significantly improves the estimation of mesoscale\nsignals [Le Traon and Dibarboure, 1999; Le Traon et al.,\n2001]. We used data from August 2001 to June 2006 in this\nstudy to calculate the SLA variance.\n3. Results\n3.1. Definition and Determination of Fronts\n[16] Fronts are identified by apparent horizontal gradients\nat various depth levels [Orsi et al., 1995; Belkin and\nGordon, 1996]. However, the particular frontal properties\ncan change both in time and space due to air-sea interaction\nand cross-frontal mixing [Belkin and Gordon, 1996]. To\nminimize these effects, one needs a database of sufficient\nspatial resolution. Belkin and Gordon [1996] suggest that a\ndistance of less then 200 km between measurements should\nbe used, which we easily achieve with our combined data\nset (Figure 4). In the present paper, we use the data set of\ntemperature and salinity profiles provided by CTD-SRDLs\ncombined with the Argo data to describe the properties and\npositions of three major fronts of the ACC. First, we show\nCTD-SRDL data to determine the frontal properties.\n[17] Figure 5 presents a section across the Drake Passage\nmeasured between 7 June 2004 and 24 June 2004 by a\ntemperature only SRDL. This is the location most routinely\nsampled by ships in the Southern Ocean, and hence the one\nat which the frontal structures are best known. Note,\nhowever, that most historical sections have been performed\nduring the months of the austral summer, when ship-based\noperations are easiest. As typically seen in meridional\nsections across the ACC, the temperature decreases to the\nsouth in a series of steps or fronts, separated by zones of\nweaker meridional gradient. This winter section shows clear\nhorizontal temperature gradients, which are associated with\nthe SAF at about 55\u0001S very close to the Burdwood Bank,\nthe PF at about 58\u0001S and the SACCF close to the conti-\nnental shelf at about 63.6\u0001S. In this figure, the SAF is\nassociated with the vertical 4\u0001C isotherm, while the PF is\nassociated with the vertical 2\u0001C isotherm above 200 dbar.\nThe mixed layer south of the PF does not show any\nevidence of the SACCF, while below the thermocline the\nSACCF is shown by the vertical 1.8\u0001C isotherm below 200\ndbar (Figure 5c). These relationships between subsurface\ntemperature and fronts agree with definitions made in\nprevious work [e.g., Orsi et al., 1995]. The satellite SST\ndata in Figure 5b also show no evidence of the SACCF,\nwhile the other two fronts are clearly seen in the meridional\ntemperature gradients from 0\u0001C to 4\u0001C (PF) and 4\u0001C to 6\u0001C\n(SAF).\n[18] Between 14 January 2005 and 26 February 2005, a\nCTD-SRDL recorded a hydrographic section further to the\neast and north from South Georgia (54\u0001S, 36\u0001W) to the\nMid-Atlantic Ridge at 43\u0001S, 17\u0001W (Figure 6a). This section\ndid not cross the ACC perpendicularly, but Figure 6e shows\nthe strong horizontal density gradients associated with the\nSAF and PF at 47\u0001S and 49.5\u0001S, respectively. There was a\nloop of the SACCF at the southern end of the section\n(Figure 6). This northward loop of the SACCF is marked by\nthe Q minimum at around 150 m and the doming of the\nisopycnals between 54\u0001S and 52\u0001S in Figure 6e. The PF is\nagain associated with the vertical 2\u0001C isotherm in the Qmin\nlayer (Figure 6c). The surface expression of the PF is very\nweak with only a low satellite SST gradient of about 1\u0001C\n(Figure 6b). The SAF however has a clear increase of\nsatellite SST from 7\u0001C to 10\u0001C. In Figure 6c, the subsurface\nexpression of the SAF correlates with the descent of the 4\u0001C\nisotherm from 100 dbar to 350 dbar to the north.\n[19] At the beginning of winter 2004, a CTD-SRDL\nsampled a meridional section northeast of Bouvet\u00f8ya from\n54\u0001S, 9\u0001E to 45\u0001S, 5\u0001E (Figure 7a). While there was no\nFigure 5. (a) Station locations from a CTD-SRDL between 7 June 2004 and 24 June 2004. Isobaths are\n2000 and 3000 m and land is shaded.

The temperature minimum layer at\naround 200 dbar is broken up to the north at around 49.5\u0001S\n(Figure 7c). A small cold water patch (Q < 2\u0001C) is found at\n49\u0001S. The northern end of this patch is also marked by a\nnear vertical potential density isopycnal of s0 = 27.4 kg\/m\n3,\nindicating the PF at 48.7\u0001S (Figure 7e).\nFigure 6.

This can be seen in the\ndifferent salinities between the section from South Georgia\nto the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Figure 6d) and the section\nfurther to the east (Figure 7d) with its higher salinities in\nthe PFZ. However, the temperature ranges belonging to\ncertain fronts were very stable in our area of interest, so we\nchoose to define the frontal positions on the basis of\ntemperature criteria at given depth levels (Table 1). We\nfound the SAF\u2019s axial indices to be very stable in our area\nof interest with a vertical 4\u0001C isotherm from 150 dbar to\n350 dbar. This is slightly different from previous work\nFigure 7. (a) Station locations from a CTD-SRDL between 13 April 2004 and 4 May 2004. Isobaths are\n2000 and 3000 m. Bouvet\u00f8ya is highlighted (BV).

The criterion for identification of the PF is similar to\nthat used in previous work [Botnikov, 1963; Belkin and\nGordon, 1996]. The vertical 2\u0001C isotherm in the Qmin layer\nis an indicator of the PF almost everywhere in the Southern\nOcean and is in agreement with the definition of the PF as\nthe location of rapid descent of the Qmin by Gordon [1971].\nDetailed descriptions of the hydrographic subsurface prop-\nerties are scarcer for the SACCF than for the SAF or PF.\nThe SACCF, as with the other ACC fronts, is identified by\nlarge horizontal density gradients through the water column\n(Figures 6 and 7). The northern limit of the front can be\nidentified from horizontal changes in the properties of\nUpper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW), a type of the\nCircumpolar Deep Water that occupies most of the deep\nlayers of the ACC [Sievers and Nowlin, 1984]. From\nanalysis of historical hydrographic sections, Orsi et al.\n[1995] locate stations north of the SACCF by a potential\ntemperature greater than 1.8\u0001C along the temperature max-\nimum of the UCDW at depths greater than 500 m. It is\napparent that this large-scale criterion presented does not\nprovide a reliable indicator for the position of the SACCF in\nlocal areas (as shown previously by Thorpe et al. [2002]\nand Meredith et al. [2003b]) and it has been shown at other\nlocations that the fronts change along-stream as they split\nand merge and are subject to seasonal cycles in heat and\nfreshwater flux [e.g., Belkin and Gordon, 1996]. Notwith-\nstanding this, the Q = 1.8\u0001C isotherm at 500 dbar pressure\nproved to be the best indicator to track the SACCF in our\narea of interest and time period.\n[21] To map the frontal positions, we used the gridded\npotential temperature fields and extracted the dedicated\nisotherm for each front as described in Appendix. For the\nposition of the SAF, we used the position of the Q = 4.0\u0001C\nisotherm at a pressure (p) of 300 dbar. For the PF we\nextracted the Q = 2.0\u0001C isotherm in the Qmin layer and, if\nnot present, the Q = 2.0\u0001C isotherm at p = 200 dbar\npressure. The SACCF was located by selecting the Q =\n1.8\u0001C isotherm at p = 500 dbar pressure (Table 1).\n3.2. Frontal Positions\n3.2.1. Subantarctic Front\n[22] The mean position of the SAF for the years 2004 and\n2005 derived from our merged data set corresponds very\nwell with the position of Orsi et al. [1995] in the western\npart of the study region, while the position in the eastern\npart lies further north. The path of the SAF is constrained by\nthe bathymetry (Figure 8). In Figure 8, the SAF flows close\nto the northern shelf slope in the western part of Drake\nPassage until it reaches 60\u0001W. Here, south of Burdwood\nBank, the SAF moves away from the shelf slope before\nturning northward. The SAF crosses the North Scotia Ridge\nand the Falkland Trough before the SAF follows the 1500 m\ndepth contour on the west side of the Argentine Abyssal\nPlain as the Malvinas Current. At 40\u0001S the SAF retroflects\nupon encountering the Brazil Current. The SAF then flows\nsouthward at about 55\u0001W until it is shifted eastward and\nflows north of the Falkland Plateau and the Falkland Ridge\nalong 48\u0001S. During this southward movement the SAF\nstarts to meander. Further to the east the mean SAF position\nof Orsi et al. [1995] shows two big loops to the south and\nnorth, which are not represented by our mean position of the\nSAF. The SAF crosses the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 45\u0001S, 15\u0001W.\n[23] The monthly SAF positions (Figures 8b and 8c)\nreveal areas with high variability and their differences\nbetween 2004 and 2005. The path from south of the Burd-\nwood Bank crossing the Falkland Plateau and the position\nalong the Brazil\/Malvinas Confluence seems always to be\nan area of higher variability of the frontal position. The\nareas of higher variability east of the Maurice Ewing Bank\nshifted from the western part (45\u0001W\u201330\u0001W) in 2004 to the\neastern part (30\u0001W\u201315\u0001W) in 2005. The path of the SAF\nacross the Mid-Atlantic Ridge seems to be strongly con-\nstrained by the underlying topography as indicated by a\nvery small variability in the frontal positions (Figures 8b\nand 8c).\n3.2.2. Polar Front\n[24] Our derived position of the PF lies mostly north of\nthe position of the PF of Moore et al. [1999] and corre-\nsponds well with the PF of Orsi et al. [1995] (Figure 9a). As\nwith the SAF, the path of the PF is also controlled by the\ntopography. In Figure 9a, the mean path of the PF starts\nwest of Drake Passage south of 60\u0001S, but north of the Hero\nFracture Zone at 66\u0001W. It then continues to the northeast\nuntil it reaches the North Scotia Ridge. Then it loops\neastward into a meander to the east end of the ridge until\nit finds a way through the Shag Rocks Passage to the north\ntoward the Maurice Ewing Bank. Here, the position of the\nPF lies further to the east than indicated in Orsi et al. The PF\nthen flows across the bank looping to the east and following\nthe 50\u0001S parallel. At 50\u0001S, 10\u0001W the PF is shifted to the\nnorth crossing the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It then loops back to\nthe southeast and follows again the 50\u0001S parallel (Figure 9a).\n[25] All the monthly positions of the PF follow this mean\npath (Figures 9b and 9c), but show a much greater variabil-\nity than the monthly SAF positions (Figures 8b and 8c). In\n2004, the PF showed a big northward loop at 65\u0001W before\ncontinuing to the northeast with less variability. During\n2004, the PF increased the eastward loop to the south of\nthe North Scotia Ridge before crossing the North Scotia\nRidge through the Shag Rocks Passage (Figure 9b). After\nlooping cyclonically around the Maurice Ewing Bank, it\nthen meandered to the east with strong variability of up to\n3\u0001 in latitude between 35\u0001W and 18\u0001W. Constrained by the\ntopography, it crossed the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 50\u0001S, 10\u0001W,\nbefore looping northward above the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.\n[26] In 2005, the PF did not show the northward move-\nment at 65\u0001W, but stronger variability within Drake Passage\n(Figure 9c). The loop to the west before crossing the North\nScotia Ridge diminished in 2005. On its way north to the\nTable 1.

It then turned east following the\ntopography. Immediately east of the Maurice Ewing Bank\nthe PF started to meander up to 3\u0001 in latitude between 42\u0001W\nand 30\u0001W. This was further to the west than in 2004\n(Figures 9b and 9c). It then crossed 50\u0001S, 10\u0001W with strong\nvariability on the east side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge before\nfollowing the bathymetry to the southeast (Figure 9c).\n3.2.3. Southern ACC Front\n[27] The average position of the SACCF is shown in\nFigure 10a. It is in good agreement with the frontal position\nof Orsi et al. [1995] modified by Thorpe et al. [2002]. The\nSACCF lies close to the shelf break of the Antarctic\nPeninsula (Figure 10a). It loops to the northwest north of\nElephant Island, very similar to the positions of Orsi et al..\nThe SACCF then meanders to the northeast toward the\nsouthwestern side of South Georgia. It wraps anticycloni-\ncally around South Georgia from the south and then retro-\nflects north of the island across the Northeast Georgia Rise\nlooping cyclonically to the southeast. At about 57\u0001S, 15\u0001W\nit lies further north than in previous work [Orsi et al., 1995].\nThe crossing of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is not resolved\nbecause of lack of data (Figure 10a).\n[28] The monthly positions reveal the high variability\nof the SACCF (Figures 10b and 10c). At the beginning of\n2004, the SACCF showed a big cyclonic loop just east of\nthe Shackleton Fracture Zone, which disappeared during\n2004 (Figure 10b). It then meandered in a 1\u0001 wide band to\nthe northeast. The area on the southwest side of South\nGeorgia showed high variability in the frontal position, with\na cyclonic loop building up to the north and disappearing\nagain during 2004. The front followed the continental shelf\nof South Georgia until the approximate region of the\nNorthwest Georgia Rise, as per Meredith et al. [2003a].\nAlthough an area of high variability, the SACCF seemed to\nbe constrained by the Northeast Georgia Rise until it\nreaches its northernmost point at 31\u0001W. It then turned\nsoutheastward until it reached 54\u0001S, 20\u0001W where it turned\nsharply southward (Figure 10b). At 58\u0001S it turned eastward\nagain, but the lack of data in 2004 hampered resolution of\nthe frontal position properly in this area. This lack of\ntemporal resolution results in positions very close to the\nmean locations. We were able to map the SACCF again\nfrom 52\u0001S, 5\u0001W from where it followed the north side of the\nSW Indian Ridge (Figure 10b).\n[29] In 2005, the SACCF showed even more variability\nthan in the previous year, with movements covering a range\nof 3\u0001 in latitude in the Scotia Sea (Figure 10c). Especially\nsouth of South Georgia the SACCF meandered and looped\nover a great range until it followed the shelf break on the\neast side of South Georgia. It then extended its position to\nthe north of the island across the Northwest Georgia Rise\nduring 2005 (Figure 10c). (This loop was already seen in\nFigure 6.) Again constrained by the Northeast Georgia Rise,\nthe SACCF reached the northernmost point further to the\nwest than in the previous year at about 34\u0001W. It then turned\nsoutheastward but lay further north than in 2004. Again at\n54\u0001S, 20\u0001W it turned sharply southward showing high\nvariability in crossing the ocean basin between the South\nSandwich Islands and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The crossing\nFigure 11. SST (top) and SST gradient (bottom) at frontal positions with mean as solid line and\nstandard deviation as patch from monthly data for the period 2004\u20132005, inclusive. The SAF is in red,\nthe PF in blue, and the SACCF in black. The dotted black line in the bottom panel shows the mean\nmeridional increase in SST to the north.\nC09012 BOEHME ET AL.: THE ACC FRONTS IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC\n13 of 19\nC09012\nof the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is not resolved in Figure 10c\nbecause of lack of data. The SACCF reappears again at 52\u0001S,\n5\u0001W, possibly suggesting that the crossing is constrained by\nthe bathymetry and follows the front of Orsi et al. [1995].\nNorth of Bouvet\u00f8ya the SACCF lay on the north side of the\nSouth West Indian Ridge (Figure 10c).\n3.3. SST and SLA\n[30] The satellite SST at the frontal positions is closely\nrelated to their meridional positions (Figure 11). The south-\nernmost position of the SAF is in Drake Passage, where the\nSST is at its minimum of about 5\u0001C. The same is true for the\nPF with an SST of below 2\u0001C at the western edge of Drake\nPassage (Figure 11). Both fronts turn then sharply north-\nward; this is reflected in the increasing SST at the front. The\nstandard deviation of the SST increases because of the more\nmeridional orientation of the front. During the northward\nloop of the SAF the SST expression rises from 6\u0001C to 9\u0001C\nbetween 60\u0001\u201350\u0001W. The SST of the PF increases between\n50\u0001\u201340\u0001W from about 4\u0001C to 6\u0001C. The SSTs of the SAF\nand PF decrease by about 2\u0001C to the east, although the\nfronts stay at the same latitude (PF) or even lie further north\n(SAF). The same is true for the SACCF but less pronounced\nand the SACCF lies further south in the east. The maximum\nSST of the SACCF is 2.5\u0001C at 30\u0001Wwith a drop to 0.5\u0001C at\n10\u0001W (Figure 11). Figure 11 also shows the longitudinal\ndistribution of the SST gradient. The SST gradient at the\nSACCF is around 1\u0001C per 100 km, which is close to the\n\u2019normal\u2019 meridional increase in SST to the north. Over short\ntime periods and small areas this gradient can be above this\nbackground noise, suggesting that the SACCF could occa-\nsionally be detected using remotely-sensed SST information\nas shown by Meredith et al. [2003b].\n[31] When comparing the average frontal positions to the\nstandard deviation of daily SST data for the period 2004 \u2013\n2005, it is obvious that the SAF and PF are in general\nassociated with bands of high variability of SST (Figure 12).\nAlthough the seasonal cycle is included here, areas of\nhigh variability (>1.5\u0001C) are related to meandering of the\nfronts and eddy activity. On the contrary, areas with low\nstandard deviation of SST indicate low variability of the\nfrontal position and less eddy activity. The area southwest\nof Burdwood Bank along the continental shelf shows low\nvariability in SST and coincides with low variability in the\nposition of the SAF (Figure 8). This feature continues further\nnorth, where the SAF is again constrained by bathymetry\nalong the shelf north of the Falklands (Figure 12). When the\nSAF turns southward, it is associated with stronger vari-\nability in SST, indicating higher variability of the frontal\nposition, which we also found in our monthly positions\n(Figure 8). The band of high SST variability along the PF\nconfirms the variability of the PF position from Drake\nPassage to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Figure 9). From Drake\nPassage to south of South Georgia the standard deviation of\nSST of 1.3\u0001C coincides with the southernmost extent of the\nSACCF (Figure 10). On the eastern side of the island a\npatch of low SST variability indicates that the SACCF is\nconstrained close to the shelf slope on this side of the island\n(Figure 12). However, north of the island the SST deviation\nincreases related to a higher variability of the frontal\nposition (Figure 10).\n[32] The variance of sea level has been used for many\nyears to identify regions of intense mesoscale variability\n[Kostianoy et al., 2003]. Figure 13 shows the SLA variance\ncalculated from weekly gridded altimeter data. In our area\nof interest are two regions of high SLA variance. The first\none lies within the ACC in the Drake Passage south of the\nSAF and along the PF. This intense mesoscale variability\nshows that the PF in the Drake Passage is generally\ndominated by current meanders and mesoscale eddies.\nThe other area of high SLA variance lies north of the mean\nSAF in the Brazil\/Malvinas Confluence. This confluence of\ncurrents creates mesoscale meanders and eddies with energy\nlevels ranked at the top of the world\u2019s oceans [Fu et al.,\n2001; Goni and Wainer, 2001; Vivier et al., 2001]. The\nmean SAF path is nestling to the west and south side of this\narea, indicating that all variability takes place north of the\nfront. At around 40\u0001W a transition zone starts where this\nFigure 12.

Discussion\n[33] In general, the average frontal positions derived from\nour data set are in agreement with previous work [Orsi et\nal., 1995; Thorpe et al., 2002], especially where the path-\nways are constrained by topography, e.g., at the North\nScotia Ridge. However, some novel features are observed,\nwhich we outline here. First, we discuss the derived\npositions of the frontal system and its variability. Then,\nwe examine the possible causes for the observed zonal shift\nof the ACC. Finally, we discuss the relationship between the\nsurface and subsurface expressions of the three major fronts.\n4.1. The Frontal Positions\n[34] The main difference between our derived mean\nposition of the SAF and the SAF location by Orsi et al.\n[1995] is the northward shift of up to 400 km east of 45\u0001W.\nThis could be the result of the slightly different temperature\ncriteria used, but we compared our location with the 4\u0001C\nisotherm at 200 dbar and 400 dbar, which are used for\nidentification of the SAF in previous work [Peterson and\nWhitworth, 1989; Orsi et al., 1993, 1995] to conclude that\nall criteria give very similar results. The SAF of Orsi et al.\n[1995] shows big loops to the south and north at about\n37\u0001W and 30\u0001W. While our mean position does not show\nsuch features, the monthly positions reveal the high vari-\nability of the SAF in this region. The loops in Orsi et al.\n[1995] are based on a limited data set and show a snapshot\nof the SAF location, while we differentiate between a mean\nlocation and monthly snapshots. However, an interesting\nfeature is that the monthly SAF positions east of the\nMaurice Ewing Bank are on average north of the SAF\nposition by Orsi et al. [1995], indicating a northward shift\nof the northern boundary of the ACC in 2004 and 2005 when\ncompared to the data available to Orsi et al. (Figure 8).\n[35] Despite the differences in defining the PF, the mean\nPF paths from previous studies agree well with our obser-\nvations, particularly in the vicinity of strong topographic\nfeatures, such as the Drake Passage and the Mid-Atlantic\nRidge. However, a relatively large difference is seen in the\nNorth Scotia Sea before the PF crosses the North Scotia\nRidge. In 2004 and 2005, the PF extended far more to the\neast than in previous work, reaching nearly 42\u0001W before\nlooping back. The PF paths from Gille [1994] and Moore et\nal. [1999] lie also further to the east than the PF of Orsi et\nal. [1995], but not to such an extent. Our monthly PF\npositions also show high spatial variability in this area, but a\nlonger time series is needed to verify if this eastward extent\nis particular to the studied time period or is a regular\noccurrence.\n[36] The mean PF path is across the Maurice Ewing\nBank, while two branches of higher SLA variance can be\nseen close to the west and south flanks of the Maurice\nEwing Bank (Figure 13). This may result from a topograph-\nically-induced lateral splitting of the PF south of the bank as\nsuggested by Naveira Garabato et al. [2002]. However, the\nmonthly PF positions show that the PF loops cyclonically\naround the bank. The PF loops southward on the eastern\nside of the Maurice Ewing Bank in 2004, but not in 2005\n(Figure 9). If this discrepancy is due to a lack of represen-\ntativeness of the data used in Naveira Garabato et al.\n[2002] or in our data set needs further investigations on a\nsmaller temporal and spatial scale.\n[37] The monthly PF positions show also strong variabil-\nity of the front due to meandering and meridional move-\nments east of 45\u0001W. Dong et al. [2006] suggested a\ncorrespondence between the tendency of the PF location\nand the meridional shift of the wind field, resulting in a\nmove equatorward during winter. Our monthly positions do\nnot support this, showing no seasonality in the monthly\npositions. This might be due to the fact that the short\ntemporal variability is larger compared with the seasonal\nvariability and that a seasonal signal is much smaller in the\nFigure 13.

Mean frontal positions of SAF, PF, and SACCF as derived by this study.\nIsobaths are 1000, 2000, and 3000 m and land is shaded black.\nC09012 BOEHME ET AL.: THE ACC FRONTS IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC\n15 of 19\nC09012\nsubsurface expression than at the surface. Our PF positions\nshow a high short-term variability due to meandering and\neddy activity and we suggest that these eddies are much\nmore important for the frontal position than the wind field.\n[38] The SACCF shows great variability north of Ele-\nphant Island. Data from the WOCE section SR1b between\n1993 and 2000 show that there are very often small,\nvertically-coherent eddies to the southern end of this section\njust north of Elephant Island [Cunningham et al., 2003].\nThese eddies have the characteristics of water from south of\nthe SB, but can be found almost as far north as the PF. This\nrich eddy field with associated low temperatures could be a\nfactor in the high variability of the SACCF to the northwest\nof Elephant Island.\n[39] Another interesting feature is the strong variability of\nthe SACCF in the vicinity of South Georgia. The SACCF\nlooped to the north before wrapping anticyclonically around\nSouth Georgia in early 2004. Meredith et al. [2005] used six\nyears (1996\u20132001) of high-resolution hydrographic data\ncollected during the austral summer to show the interannual\nvariability of the water mass properties around South\nGeorgia and concluded that significant variability occurs\nat subannual time scales. Indeed, our monthly SACCF\npositions show a high subannual variability (Figure 10).\nDuring the austral summer 2004\/2005, the path of the\nSACCF moved further south, while the PF extended a loop\nalong the North Scotia Ridge to the east before turning back\nto the west and crossing the North Scotia Ridge. At the end\nof 2005, the PF again lay further west, while the SACCF\nagain looped northward before wrapping around South\nGeorgia. This interplay and the strong variability north of\nthe island, as shown in Figures 9 and 10, must have\nimplications on the South Georgia ecosystem. We examine\nthe potential impact of this physical variability on the local\necosystem separately using merged Argo\/CTD-SRDL data\n(R. Saunders et al., unpublished data, 2007).\n[40] In 2004, the SAF shows strong meandering and eddy\nactivity west of 30\u0001W, while the PF shows the same further\ndownstream east of 30\u0001W. This transition takes place, where\nthe two fronts are in close proximity, enhancing the bar-\noclinic gradients and conditions favoring eddy formation.\nThis is consistent with higher SLA variance in this region to\nas far south as the SACCF (Figure 13). Strong meandering\nand eddy activities are associated with the SAF from 45\u0001\u2013\n40\u0001W, with the PF from 40\u0001\u201330\u0001W and with the SACCF\naround 30\u0001\u201325\u0001W. This \u2018\u2018downstream\u2019\u2019 effect might be\ninduced by eddies shed by the northerly front moving\nsouthwards, enhancing the baroclinic gradients even further,\nwhich in turn results in new eddy formation. This process\nwould also transfer heat from the north to the south. This\nalso supports the argument of Sun and Watts [2002], who\nsuggested that the mean flow of the ACC transports heat\nfrom warm subtropical regions to cold subpolar regions.\nSun and Watts [2002] also showed that the ACC warms in\nthe western South Atlantic, cools until south of Africa,\ngaining heat again in the Indian Ocean and cools in the\nSouth Pacific. This heat loss is shown in Figure 11 by a\ndecrease of SST of about 2\u0001C to the east, although the fronts\nstay at the same latitude (PF) or even lie further north\n(SAF). The strong meandering in this area and frontal loops\nacross the same longitude more than once cannot be\nresolved by using the methods of Dong et al. [2006] and\nMoore et al. [1999]. This demonstrates the advantage of\nbeing able to track such movements of ACC fronts even\nmore clearly using in-situ data.\n4.2. A Shift of the ACC\n[41] Interestingly, the mean SAF, as positioned by our\ndata set, crossed the Mid-Atlantic Ridge about 400 km\nfurther north than the SAF of Orsi et al. [1995]. The mean\nSACCF path follows the path by Orsi et al. [1995] and\nThorpe et al. [2002] very closely, but at 15\u0001W the SACCF\nlies further north. When the spatial resolution of our data set\nis best in this area (at the end of 2005), the SACCF was\nsituated up to 150 km further north when compared to the\nlocation of Orsi et al. [1995] The SAF and SACCF are deep\nreaching fronts and are constrained by the bathymetry in\nmany places. This change from one constrained passing\nplace to another one further north suggests a major shift in\nthe location of the ACC between Orsi et al. [1995] and our\nfindings.\n[42] It has been argued that such shifts can happen in\nresponse to changes in wind stress. Such changes have been\nhappening in recent decades. For example, Thompson and\nSolomon [2002] show an increased strength of the zonal\nwinds over the Southern Ocean in the past three decades. A\nrecent study argued that this will be followed by a signif-\nicant increase in transport and a poleward change in position\nof the ACC [Fyfe and Saenko, 2006]. However, Meredith\nand Hogg [2006] cast doubt on whether this process\ndescribed by Fyfe and Saenko [2006] is real or an artifact\nof coarse-resolution climate models. Contrary to Fyfe and\nSaenko [2006], we see a northward shift of the ACC in\nsome locations in 2004 and 2005, when compared to\nprevious work. Our findings suggest that the effect of eddies\non the variability of the frontal positions is much more\nimportant than the seasonal wind field. This strengthens the\nargument of Meredith and Hogg [2006] that the zonal wind\nstress has no direct long term impact on the location and\ntransport of the ACC. According to Meredith and Hogg\n[2006], eddies act to constrain such changes of the ACC that\noccur when changes in wind forcing occur. Nevertheless,\nDong et al. [2006] suggest that there is observational\nevidence for this process. A northward shift of the maxi-\nmum zonal wind stress may also force the PF to move to the\nnorth with variations in the wind field leading variations in\nthe PF path [Dong et al., 2006]. Changes in the wind field\non time scales shorter than seasonal can change the ACC\ntransport [Aoki, 2002; Hughes et al., 2003] and therefore\nmight alter the frontal positions.\n4.3. Correlations Between the Surface and\nSubsurface Expressions\n[43] Some of the previous studies used satellite SST to\ndefine the positions of the ACC fronts. While this can be\nappropriate for the SAF, and to a lesser extent the PF, it\ncould be quite difficult for determining the SACCF position\n(Figure 11). Nevertheless, Meredith et al. [2003b] showed\nan SST signal that was associated with the SACCF close to\nSouth Georgia, indicating the potential of SST for remote\ndetection of this front for certain times and places.\n[44] Consistent with previous studies, Dong et al. [2006]\nand others suggested that the surface PF location tends to be\nsouth of the subsurface PF location. Figure 9a supports this\nC09012 BOEHME ET AL.: THE ACC FRONTS IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC\n16 of 19\nC09012\nargument, showing our derived locations of the PF gener-\nally north of the PF locations of Moore et al. [1999].\nAdmittedly, the topography seems to play an important\nrole. Our comparisons between the PF positions and satel-\nlite SST data showed that when the PF path is constrained\nby topography, the SST gradient is high, suggesting a\nconcurrence of surface and subsurface locations. However,\nover deep ocean basin regions with weak topographic\nvariations, the PF meanders substantially, and the SST\ngradient is weak [Moore et al., 1999; Dong et al., 2006].\n[45] The SST gradient at the PF in Figure 11 varies\nbetween 1\u0001C and 3.5\u0001C with a peak of more than 5\u0001C,\nwhich is similar to Dong et al. [2006]. Interestingly Moore\net al. [1999] show a peak in the SST gradient for the PF\nfrom the Drake Passage to 20\u0001W, while we found two\npeaks, one at 60\u0001Wand another one at 40\u0001W. The minimum\nis in between where the PF crosses the North Scotia Ridge.\nEither the SST gradient is very small or the surface and\nsubsurface expression of the PF are different here. We\nsuggest the latter, because this is also the place with the\nbiggest differences between our mean path and the path\nbased on the surface expression by Moore et al. [1999]\n(Figure 9a). Also to the east of 30\u0001W the SST gradient of\nthe PF is very weak, suggesting a higher separation between\nthe surface and subsurface expression. Here the small SST\ngradient of the SAF suggests a separation between the\nsurface and subsurface expression too. The SST gradient\nof the SAF is relatively weak except at two locations, where\nthe SAF is constrained by the topography at 50\u201340\u0001W\nnorth of the Falkland Plateau and at 10\u0001Wafter crossing the\nMid-Atlantic Ridge. This feature is also present in the PF\nand SACCF east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. However, all\nfronts show high SST gradients when they reach their\nnorthermost point (Figure 11).\n5. Summary\n[46] Analysis of in-situ hydrographic data of the years\n2004 and 2005 in the southwest Atlantic sector of the\nSouthern Ocean has produced maps of the SAF, PF and\nSACCF within the ACC at high spatial and temporal\nresolution. The availability of Argo float data and the\ncomplementary CTD-SRDL data have allowed us to exam-\nine the fronts simultaneously in much more detail than\npreviously possible. In defining the fronts, we have placed\nmost weight on the distribution of horizontal temperature\ngradients. Defining the fronts in this way corresponds to\nvarious scalar criteria used by earlier investigators. The data\ncollected by animal-borne CTD-SRDLs proved to be very\nuseful in obtaining several cross-sections of the ACC at\ndifferent locations and seasons. The existence of suitable\nproxies expressed in terms of subsurface temperature or\nsatellite SST has allowed us to examine the spatial and\ntemporal variability of the front locations. The results can be\nsummarised as follows:\n[47] 1. New technology has enabled us to produce an in-\nsitu data set with high temporal and spatial resolution even\nin the Southern Ocean. The Global Ocean Observing\nSystem required the establishment of Argo, which is\ndesigned for broad-scale ocean sampling. Smaller scale\neddy-resolving sampling is complementary to the broad-\nscale mode and can be achieved by using autonomous CTD-\nSatellite Relay Data Loggers, which can be attached to\nmarine animals. These high-accuracy sensors proved to\nhave the ability to collect large numbers of profiles cost-\neffectively particularly in regions where traditional ocean-\nographic measurements are scarce. They are a powerful\ncomplement to the array of Argo floats. Both technologies\nsend data via satellites and have a great potential for\nobserving the ocean in real-time, when used in tandem.\n[48] 2. Our comprehensive data set enabled us to map the\nmonthly positions of the SAF, PF and SACCF in 2004 and\n2005. This time series indicates areas of high variability in\nthese frontal locations. The SAF is constrained by the South\nAmerican continental shelf, but shows high variability west\nof the Burdwood Bank and when crossing the ocean basin\nbetween South America and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The\nPF is the most active front with meandering along its entire\npath through our study region. It is constrained by the North\nScotia Ridge and the Mid-Atlanic Ridge. The mean path of\nthe PF is across the Maurice Ewing Bank, although SLA\nvariance suggests two branches to the west and south of the\nbank. This needs further investigations on a smaller scale.\nThe SACCF shows high variability in the Scotia Sea and to\nthe northeast of South Georgia, but it is also constrained by\nspecific topographic features. All frontal variability seems\nto be much more influenced by meandering and eddies than\npossible seasonality in the wind field. The spatial pattern of\nhigher variability changes between the two years.\n[49] 3. The position of the PF is highly variable south of\nthe North Scotia Ridge. The front also extends much further\nto the east before crossing the North Scotia Ridge than in\nprevious work. The extension of this eastward loop varies\nover time with the greatest extent in austral summer 2004\/\n2005. The SACCF shows a northward loop on the west side\nof South Georgia before wrapping around the island. Again\nthe size of this loop is highly variable with its peaks in\nwinter 2004 and at the end of 2005. Whether these two\nfrontal feature are coupled needs further investigations.\n[50] 4. After looping anticyclonically around South\nGeorgia, the SACCF shows a strong variability in the\nposition of its retroflection north of the island. This tongue\nof the SACCF has its greatest extent to the west during\nwinter. In 2004, this feature is less pronounced than in 2005,\nwhere it reached the Northwest Georgia Rise. Despite the\nmeandering, the SACCF is constrained by the South Georgia\nshelf, the Northeast Gorgia Rise and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.\n[51] 5. Previous studies were limited by the sparse hy-\ndrographic data in the Southern Ocean or were constrained\nby the continuity of the SST at the fronts when using\nsatellite SST maps. The frontal positions based on the\nsubsurface expressions within this study are compared to\nsatellite SST. The SST gradient is in general the highest when\nthe fronts are constrained by the bathymetry, induced by the\nconcurrence of the surface and subsurface expression.\n[52] 6. SST and SLA variance support the argument that\nthere is a transition zone starting around 40\u0001W where eddy\nenergy is shifted from the north side of the SAF to the south,\nin particular in the vicinity of the SACCF at about 30\u0001\u2013\n25\u0001W.\n[53] 7. East of 40\u0001W, all three fronts were shifted further\nto the north than historical positions suggested, varying\nbetween 400 km for the SAF and 150 km for the SACCF.\nC09012 BOEHME ET AL.: THE ACC FRONTS IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC\n17 of 19\nC09012\nThis northward shifting of the ACC would not have been\nexpected from previous work.\nAppendix\n[54] All hydrographic data are used to generate horizontal\ntemperature fields. To calculate the best estimate of tem-\nperature at each grid point, an optimal interpolation scheme\nsimilar to the one introduced by Boehme and Send [2005] is\nused. At each grid point the objective estimate of temper-\nature Tobj is then given by:\nTobj \u00bc hdi \u00fe w \n d\u000b hdi\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f0A1\u00de\nwhere d = [d1, . . ., dn] denotes the set of temperature values,\nhdi denotes the mean value of the set of d and w is the\nweighting matrix. We assume the covariance of the data d to\nbe exponential. However, the flow of the ACC follows the\ntopography and a Gaussian function is not satisfactory. To\ntake the complex topography into account each in-situ\nprofile is weighted by three distances: the spatial distance D,\nthe fractional distance in potential planetary vorticity F and\nthe temporal distance Dt to the grid point Davis [1998];\nD \u00bc j0\u000b Ij\nF \u00bc jPV 0\u00f0 \u00de \u000b PV I\u00f0 \u00dejffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nPV 2 0\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe PV 2 I\u00f0 \u00dep\nDt \u00bc jt0 \u000b tI j: \u00f0A2\u00de\nIn equation (A2) the position (xi, yi) of the in-situ data point\nis given in I and the date in tI, while the grid point position\nis 0 and the date t0. D is the spatial distance between the two\npoints. F takes account of the differences in barotropic\npotential vorticity PV:\nPV \u00bc f\nH\n; \u00f0A3\u00de\nwith the planetary vorticity f and the water depth H (taken\nfrom the 5-minute gridded global relief data TerrainBase\n(http:\/\/www.ngdc.noaa.gov). The PV criterion might be\nmisleading in some cases, as two points with similar\npotential vorticity but lying in different basins separated by\na ridge could have very different properties. This problem\nalso exists when using a simple Gaussian mapping scheme.\nThe modification by introducing the potential planetary\nvorticity into the mapping scheme gives superior results as\noutlined in Boehme and Send [2005].\n[55] The covariance is a function of the temporal and\nspatial separation, and the exponential decay scale is deter-\nmined by the spatial scale l [km], the cross-isobathic scale\nF [dimensionless], as well as the temporal scale t [days]\n[Wong et al., 2003; Boehme and Send, 2005]. The covari-\nance matrix for the temperature\u2013grid data (Cdg) and the\ntemperature\u2013temperature covariance matrix (Cdd) then take\nthe form:\nCddij x; y; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc s2\n\u0004 \u0005 \n exp \u000b Dij\nl\n\u00fe Fij\nF\n\u00feDt\n2\nt2\n\u0006 \u0007\b \t\n;\nCdgi x; y; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc s2\n\u0004 \u0005 \n exp \u000b Di0\nl\n\u00fe Fio\nF\n\u00feDt\n2\nt2\n\u0006 \u0007\b \t\n: \u00f0A4\u00de\nhs2i is the signal variance of the temperature data. The\ninverse solution then is McIntosh [1990]\nw \u00bc Cdg \n Cdd \u00fe I \n h2\u0004 \u0005\n \u000b\u000b1; \u00f0A5\u00de\nwhere I denotes the identity matrix.\n[56] The scale parameters used for objective mapping are\nas important as the method itself, as they will represent the\nhydrographic structure of the ocean, hence it is necessary to\ncalculate these scale parameters from the correlation func-\ntion of in-situ measurements.\n[57] According to the objective mapping method used a\ntime-independent spatial scale, a cross-isobath scale and a\ntemporal scale are required. Following Boehme and Send\n[2005], the normalized autocorrelation function R(D, F) is\ncalculated and then fitted by an exponential distribution,\nwhich yields the scaling parameters l andF set to l = 200 km\nand F = 0.3. Due to a lack of reliable information with\nwhich to calculate the temporal scale, we instead used daily\nSST data. Using these data, processes with time scales from\none day to two years are resolved. Again we followed the\nmethod of Boehme and Send, which yields a temporal scale\nof t = 112 days.\n[58] This interpolation scheme is used to calculate the\npotential temperature field on different depth levels. All\nthese calculations are done on a 0.4\u0001 \u0002 0.25\u0001 grid (\u000325 km)\nfrom 80\u0001W to 15\u0001E and 63\u0001S to 40\u0001S. The first run used all\navailable Argo and CTD-SRDL data from 2004 and 2005\nwith no time scale to calculate the average temperature field\nof this time period. We mapped temperature fields at 200,\n300 and 500 dbar depths and the temperature of the\ntemperature minimum layer. To avoid eddy-like features\nwe only used the most unbroken isotherms from west to\neast.\n[59] To resolve the high temporal variability of the fronts,\nwe used the same scheme to calculate the frontal positions\non a monthly basis. Using the detected temporal scale t, we\nmapped the temperature fields to the middle of each month\nin 2004 and 2005 and extracted the dedicated isotherms.\nThis gives us 24 monthly positions for each front from\nJanuary 2004 to December 2005.\n[60] Acknowledgments.
