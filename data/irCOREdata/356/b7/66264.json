A theoretical analysis and numerical sim-\nulations have been carried out and the results are presented. The technique, named\nSPLASH (Sky-Projected Laser Array Shack-Hartmann), is shown to suffer consider-\nably less from focal anisoplanatism than a conventional laser guide star system. The\nmethod is potentially suitable for large telescope apertures (\u223c 8 m), and possibly for\nextremely large telescopes.\nKey words: Instrumentation: adaptive optics \u2013 Telescopes.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nLaser guide stars (LGSs) (Foy & Labeyrie 1985) solve some\nof the drawbacks of conventional adaptive optics (AO) sys-\ntems employing natural guide stars (NGSs), most notably\nsky coverage limitations. However, unlike NGS AO systems,\nLGSs suffer from focal anisoplanatism (FA) or the \u201ccone\neffect\u201d (Parenti & Sasiela 1994). This effect becomes more\nsevere with increasing telescope aperture size, meaning that\na single LGS on an extremely large telescope (ELT) would be\nunusable. FA can be at least partially overcome using multi-\nconjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) (Beckers 1988), in which\nmeasurements from multiple LGSs are combined. In this pa-\nper we outline an alternative to a conventional LGS in which\nFA is significantly reduced for a single-conjugate AO sys-\ntem. The technique, which we call SPLASH (Sky Projected\nLaser Array Shack-Hartmann), is a pseudo-reverse of a con-\nventional Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (WFS). Unlike\na conventional LGS system, the atmosphere is sensed on the\nupward path of the laser. An array of converging beams is\nlaunched from the primary mirror of the telescope to pro-\nduce an array of Shack-Hartmann spots projected onto the\nsky, which are then imaged by the whole telescope.\nA number of alternatives to \u201cconventional\u201d LGS wave-\nfront sensing have been suggested. Baharav et al. (1994;\n1996) proposed the creation of a fringe pattern in the at-\nmosphere which is analysed by a Shack-Hartmann wave-\nfront sensor. A disadvantage is that very high laser powers\nare required, although this has recently been ameliorated\nby the suggested adaptation of a pyramid wavefront sensor\n(Ribak & Ragazzoni 2001). A proposal by Lloyd-Hart et al.\n(2001) involves producing a number of images of different\n\u22c6 E-mail:timothy.butterley@durham.ac.uk\nplanes in the atmosphere as the laser propagates through\na focus. These images are then used in a phase diversity\nwavefront sensor. Angel (2001) also proposed a system of\ndynamically refocusing the laser spot so as to effectively in-\ncrease the integration time. Kellner et al. (2004) proposed\nusing Bessel beams as pseudo-inverse guide stars (PIGS).\nRibak and Ragazzoni (2004) also proposed a method of re-\nducing laser spot elongation using distributed launch optics.\nAll of these systems share the common characteristic with\nthe conventional LGS system that the aberrations are sensed\nduring the return downwards path of the laser, unlike the\nscheme proposed here, and they also suffer from focal aniso-\nplanatism.\nA further alternative, P 4 (Projected Pupil Plane\nPatterns) (Buscher et al. 2002) shares similarities with\nSPLASH. A laser beam is expanded to fill the pupil of the\ntelescope and is propagated upward through the atmosphere\nas a parallel beam. The beam cross-section is imaged at dif-\nferent altitudes and the wavefront distortion is determined\nby comparing the intensity distributions. This method does\nnot suffer from focal anisoplanatism and, like SPLASH, the\naberrations are sensed on the upward path. However, P 4\npotentially suffers from two key drawbacks: the observation\nlayers need to be separated sufficiently in altitude for the\nbeam intensity distribution to evolve, and the measurements\nmay be distorted by non-uniform scattering from the atmo-\nsphere. These limitations are not applicable to SPLASH.\nThe basic concept of SPLASH was first presented in\nLove et al. (2004), but has much in common with Tsch-\nerning aberrometry \u2013 a technique used in ophthalmology\nto measure optical aberrations in the human eye. This\nwas first described by Tscherning (1894) and has become\nmore widely adopted in recent years, eg. Mrochen et al.\n(Mrochen et al. 2000). Here we present results of a theo-\n2 T. Butterley et al.\nretical analysis and a closed-loop numerical simulation to\nvalidate the SPLASH technique. In Sect. 2 we outline the\nconcept and describe the advantages and problems associ-\nated with the technique. We present our theoretical analysis\nand its results in Sect. 3, and a description of our numerical\nmodel and its results in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 we summarise our\nresults and outline the remaining problems not addressed in\nthis paper.\n2 DESCRIPTION OF SPLASH\nThis section describes the key principles of the SPLASH\ntechnique of wavefront sensing and outlines the advantages\nand disadvantages associated with the technique.\n2.1 SPLASH concept\nSPLASH wavefront sensing is a pseudo-inverse of conven-\ntional LGS\/Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing in which the\natmosphere is sensed on the upward path of the laser beam\ninstead of the return path. The basic premise, illustrated in\nFig. 1, is to project an array of converging laser beams, each\nof size \u223c r0 (where r0 is the Fried parameter), from the pri-\nmary mirror of the telescope to form an array of spots on\nthe sky. The position of each spot on the sky depends on\nthe local (subaperture) wavefront gradient. The spots are\nimaged through the full telescope aperture, so the position\nof the final image of each spot will be altered by the global\n(full aperture) tilt. Hence the position of each spot image\ngives a measure of the local tilt minus the global tilt \u2013 ex-\nactly the same quantity as is measured in a conventional\nShack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (WFS) when used with a\nlaser beacon. This assumes that the angular size of the spot\npattern on the sky is smaller than the isokinetic patch (the\nangle over which the wavefront tilt is isoplanatic).\nThe technique could be implemented with either a\nRayleigh or a sodium beacon, although implementation of\na sodium layer SPLASH system presents more of a chal-\nlenge in focusing the beams than the Rayleigh version, due\nto the extremely long focal length. Range gating is essen-\ntial, for both the Rayleigh and sodium versions of SPLASH,\nin order to allow the beacons to be imaged without being\nswamped by backscattered light from lower altitudes.\n2.2 Focal anisoplanatism\nThe main proposed advantage of a SPLASH LGS is that it\nsuffers considerably less from FA than a conventional LGS.\nHowever, it is still affected by FA and, as a result of the\nunusual configuration, the FA effects are manifested in a\ndifferent way to that seen in a conventional LGS\/Shack-\nHartmann WFS combination.\nSPLASH is affected by FA twice, on the upward and\ndownward paths of the light. On the upward path, where\nthe wavefront is sensed, the local gradient measured by each\nbeam will have a slight error due to FA \u2013 see Fig. 2. As each\nspot is then imaged from a different position in the sky, the\nreturn paths of the light from the spots each sample the\natmosphere differently so that the global tilt on each sub-\naperture centroid is separately corrupted by a combination\nof focal and angular anisoplanatism.\nThere is an additional error on the upward path due to\na \u201clever arm effect\u201d. The distance a spot moves due to a lo-\ncal wavefront tilt depends on the altitude at which the tilt is\napplied \u2013 a ground layer tilt will cause a larger spot motion\nthan a tilt of the same magnitude applied higher up. This is\nnot expected to be a significant problem for closed loop op-\neration, especially for a sodium LGS system, although it will\nhave the effect of slightly reducing the system bandwidth.\n2.3 Effect of diffraction on SPLASH\nFigures 1 and 2 assume geometrical optics but in reality\nthe SPLASH beams will be affected by diffraction, result-\ning in a finite spot size on the sky. The minimum size of\nthe spots depends on the size of the launch subapertures,\nthe laser wavelength, the laser beam intensity distribution\nand the beacon altitude, with the seeing resulting in a fur-\nther increase in the size of the spots. Thus the spots could\npotentially overlap on the sky making centroiding difficult\nor impossible. For the sodium beacon case the longer beam\npropagation distance will result in larger sky spots than in\nthe Rayleigh beacon case, worsening the problem of overlap-\nping spots.\nFor beams with a Gaussian intensity profile, minimum\nspot size on sky would be achieved by launching the beams\nfrom subapertures of size \u223c 2-3 r0. This would limit the\nwavefront sampling, meaning that SPLASH would be un-\nsuitable for high-order wavefront sensing. However, such a\nsystem would be ideal for adaptive optics in the infrared.\nLaunching Gaussian beams would not be possible using the\napproach illustrated in figure 1 but could be achieved using,\nfor example, holographic techniques.\nThe problem of overlapping spots could also be reduced\nby implementing a method of time-interleaving the sub-\napertures such that only a subset of the beams would be\nlaunched at any given time. All of the spots would be pro-\njected and imaged in each complete cycle of the system, but\nthe wavefront-sensing would be divided into sub-cycles with\neach sub-cycle involving a combination of subapertures cho-\nsen to avoid overlapping of the spots.\nAside from the issue of overlapping spots, diffraction\neffects may serve to partially remove the effects of FA on\nthe upward paths of the beams. The broadened beams will\nsample higher-altitude turbulent layers more fully than the\nidealised geometrical-optics \u201ccones\u201d shown in figures 1 and\n2.\n2.4 Effect of turbulence on return path\nReturn path tip\/tilt has already been discussed but some\nconsideration needs to be given to higher order aberrations.\nThe subapertures in a conventional Shack-Hartmann WFS\nare of similar size to the SPLASH launch subapertures,\ni.e. \u223c r0. Thus the wavefront aberration across each sub-\naperture is dominated by low spatial frequencies and the\nsubaperture images are generally not speckled. In SPLASH\nthe sky spots are imaged through the full telescope aper-\nture (with a many-r0 diameter) and the turbulence-induced\naberrations on the downward path can contain significant\nhigh spatial frequency aberrations. As a result the point\nspread functions (PSFs) could become speckled, and as\nA Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor projected onto the sky with reduced focal anisoplanatism 3\nFigure 1. Concept of SPLASH, showing the upward passage of the beams. A possible optical implementation is shown whereby the\nlaser is launched via a lenslet array. This is only a conceptual diagram and not a formal optical design - practical implementation may\nrequire a rather different approach for reasons discussed in the main text. The size of each of the converging beams is \u223c r0 although we\nhave only shown four here for clarity. Furthermore, we have shown the beams as converging to a point, whereas in reality they would be\nbroadened by diffraction. See text for more discussion.\nthe amount of speckling increases the centroid of the PSF\ncan be expected to become poorly correlated with the lo-\ncal wavefront tilt. This effect is known as \u201ccentroid aniso-\nplanatism\u201d (Yura & Tavis 1985; Churnside et al. 1985), and\nbecomes significant for values ofD\/r0 greater than about 10.\nThe speckling effect could be reduced by masking off a\nlarge portion of the aperture so that the spot pattern would\nbe imaged through a much smaller aperture. This is not\nreally a viable solution, however, because it would lead to an\nincrease in tip\/tilt anisoplanatism (i.e. differences in global\ntip\/tilt on the return paths from the sky spots).\nIn a closed-loop system the return-path aberrations\nwould be removed by the wavefront corrector, so only the\nresidual wavefront error would contribute to centroid aniso-\nplantism. However, if the spots were too badly speckled to\nbegin with it might be impossible to close the loop.\n2.5 Laser power requirements\nWe do not present any formal laser power calculations here,\nhowever the power requirements of a SPLASH system can be\nexpected to be comparable to those of a conventional single-\nLGS system. In a traditional LGS system the light from a\nsingle beacon is split between many WFS subapertures. In\na SPLASH system, although a separate beacon is launched\nfrom each subaperture, each beacon is imaged through the\nfull telescope aperture and the brightness of the beacons\ncan be reduced accordingly. Therefore, providing the beams\nlaunched from the different subapertures all have the same\nintensity, the increase in collecting area balances the increase\nin the number of beacons. Launch methods in which the\nbeam brightness varies between subapertures, such as that\nillustrated in Fig. 1, will require higher laser power.\nWe now present a theoretical analysis of SPLASH, tak-\ning into account the effect of FA on the upward path but\nneglecting the effects of diffraction and return path turbu-\nlence.\n3 THEORETICAL ESTIMATE OF THE\nEFFECT OF FOCAL ANISOPLANATISM ON\nSPLASH\nThis section describes a modal analysis of a SPLASH WFS,\ngiving an estimate of the effect of FA on the upward\n(wavefront-sensing) path of the light. The effects of turbu-\n4 T. Butterley et al.\nFigure 2. Left: The upward paths followed by the beams. Each beam samples the atmosphere above its own subaperture, and each beam\nis affected separately by focal anisoplanatism. Right: The downward paths taken by the light from each spot. The spots are observed\nthrough the full telescope aperture so the light does not pass through the same section of atmosphere as the upward-propagating\n(wavefront sensing) beams. The upward-propagating beams are affected by the local wavefront gradient, and the downward beams by\nthe global gradient (corrupted by focal and angular anisoplanatism). The paths from one subaperture are darkened to show the regions\nof the atmosphere encountered by light from that subaperture. The horizontal lines indicate turbulent layers.\nFigure 3. Illustration of how the telescope pupil is projected onto a turbulent layer at height h = H\/4. Areas shaded grey are not\nsensed. Left: Natural guide star - light is parallel so the pupil is fully sampled at all altitudes; Middle: Conventional LGS - as a result\nof FA, the entire pupil is projected onto a smaller circle as altitude increases; Right: SPLASH - each subaperture is projected onto a\nsmaller square with increasing altitude as a result of FA, but the spacing of the subapertures remains the same.\nlence on the return path are excluded (but are considered\nlater in section 4).\nZernike polynomials are a convenient basis set for a\nmodal analysis of wavefront correction on a circular aper-\nture. We will use the same conventions for normalisation\nand numbering of Zernike modes as described by Noll (1976).\nThe phase distortion, \u03c6(Rr), across a circular aperture can\nbe expressed in terms of Zernike polynomials, Zj , as\n\u03c6(Rr) =\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\najZj(r), (1)\nwhere R is the radius of the aperture, r is the spatial co-\nordinate normalised to unit radius and aj are the Zernike\ncoefficients, given by\naj =\n\u222b\n\u03c6(Rr)Zj(r)W (r)dr, (2)\nwhere W (r) is the pupil function. We explicitly exclude the\nA Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor projected onto the sky with reduced focal anisoplanatism 5\naperture-averaged phase (piston) from the summation in\nequation 1. If the first N Zernike modes could be perfectly\ncorrected, the residual wavefront distortion would then be\n\u03c6(Rr) =\n\u221e\u2211\nN+1\najZj(r). (3)\nProviding the Zernike modes are normalised as described by\nNoll (1976), the mean square residual phase error across the\naperture can be written as\n\u03c32\u03c6 = \u3008\u03c6\n2\u3009 \u2212\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u3008|aj |\n2\u3009. (4)\nA wavefront sensor gives estimates bj of the first N Zernike\ncoefficients aj . If these modes were corrected as accurately as\nthey could be measured, the residual phase variance would\nbe\n\u03c32\u03c6 =\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u3008|aj \u2212 bj |\n2\u3009+\n\u221e\u2211\nj=N+1\n\u3008a2j\u3009\n=\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u3008|a2j + b\n2\nj \u2212 2ajbj |\u3009 +\n\u221e\u2211\nj=N+1\n\u3008a2j\u3009\n=\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\n\u3008a2j\u3009+\nN\u2211\nj=1\n(\n\u3008b2j \u2212 2ajbj\u3009\n)\n=\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\n\u3008a2j\u3009+\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u3008b2j \u3009 \u2212 2\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u3008ajbj\u3009. (5)\nThe variances of the modal coefficients \u3008a2j\u3009 are given by the\nleading diagonal of Noll\u2019s Zernike covariance matrix. Thus\nto predict the performance of the WFS, we need to know the\nvariances of the estimated modal coefficients \u3008b2j\u3009 and the co-\nvariances between the estimated modal coefficients and the\nactual modal coefficients \u3008ajbj\u3009. These variances can be cal-\nculated for a WFS with an NGS using techniques described\nby Wilson & Jenkins (1996) and Cubalchini (1979).\nThe phase gradient averaged over subaperture i of a\nShack-Hartmann WFS is given by\ngi =\n\u03bb\npiD\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\naj\n\u222b\nsubaperture i\n\u2207Zj(r)dr (6)\nwhere D is the telescope aperture diameter and \u03bb is the\nwavelength (the factor \u03bb\/piD scales the phase tilt from units\nof radians of phase per telescope radius to radians of angle).\nThere are two orthogonal phase gradients for each subaper-\nture (commonly referred to as tip and tilt). This equation\ncan be written in matrix form as\ng =\n\u03bb\npiD\nD\n\u221e\na (7)\nwhere g and a are the vectors of subaperture gradients and\nmodal coefficients respectively and D\u221e is the matrix of (x\nand y) subaperture-averaged derivatives of a large number\nof Zernike functions. Note that, due to the Zernike normal-\nisation used, the elements of D\u221e are in units of radians of\nphase per telescope radius. The modal coefficient estimates\nb are usually found using\nb =\npiD\n\u03bb\nD\n\u22121\ng (8)\nwhere D\u22121 is the least squares inverse of a D-matrix con-\ntaining a small number of Zernike modes (only as many as\nthe WFS is of sufficiently high order to measure). The modal\ncovariance matrix for the WFS is given by\nC =\n(\npiD\n\u03bb\n)2\nD\n\u22121\nG(D\u22121)T (9)\nwhere G is a matrix of tip and tilt covariances between\nsubapertures (i.e. Gil = \u3008gigl\u3009). Each element of the matrix\nC is a covariance between two Zernike modes, i.e. Cjk =\n\u3008bjbk\u3009. For a perfect wavefront sensor the matrix C would\nbe equal to Noll\u2019s matrix (i.e. \u3008bjbk\u3009 = \u3008ajak\u3009).\nUp to this point the analysis described has been for\na Shack-Hartmann WFS viewing an NGS (equivalent to a\nconventional LGS or SPLASH system with turbulence only\nat the ground i.e. with no FA). We are interested in the effect\nof FA on the performance of a SPLASH WFS, so we now\nintroduce this into the analysis. We consider an atmosphere\nconsisting of just one turbulent layer, although extending\nthe analysis to include multiple layers is straightforward.\nWe take the height of the layer above the ground to be h\nand the beacon height to be H . Figure 3 shows how FA\naffects the sampling of an atmospheric layer. We define b\u2032j\nto be the SPLASH estimate of Zernike coefficient aj in the\npresence of FA (note that bj still represents the estimate aj\nin the absence of FA). Thus, with reference to Equation 5,\nthe residual phase variance is now given by\n\u03c32\u03c6 =\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\n\u3008a2j\u3009+\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u3008b\u20322j \u3009 \u2212 2\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u3008ajb\n\u2032\nj\u3009. (10)\nWe define g\u2032i to be the phase gradient averaged over the\nprojection of subaperture i onto the turbulent layer, given\nby\ng\u2032i =\n\u03bb\npiD\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\naj\n\u222b\nsubaperture i with FA\n\u2207Zj(r)dr. (11)\nThen g\u2032 is the vector of FA-affected subaperture gradients,\ngiven by\ng\n\u2032 =\n\u03bb\npiD\nD\n\u2032\u221e\na (12)\nwhere D \u2032\u221e is the matrix of a large number of Zernike func-\ntions averaged over FA-projected subapertures (see Figure\n3). Two more modal covariance matrices can now be calcu-\nlated:\nC\n\u2032 =\n(\npiD\n\u03bb\n)2\nD\n\u2032\u22121\nG\n\u2032(D\u22121)T (13)\nC\n\u2032\u2032 =\n(\npiD\n\u03bb\n)2\nD\n\u2032\u22121\nG\n\u2032\u2032(D \u2032\u22121)T (14)\nwhere the elements of these G- and C-matrices are\nG\n\u2032\nil = \u3008gig\n\u2032\nl\u3009 (15)\nG\n\u2032\u2032\nil = \u3008g\n\u2032\nig\n\u2032\nl\u3009 (16)\nC\n\u2032\njk = \u3008bjb\n\u2032\nk\u3009 (17)\nC\n\u2032\u2032\njk = \u3008b\n\u2032\njb\n\u2032\nk\u3009. (18)\nWe make the assumption that the performance of the\nwavefront sensor is essentially perfect in the absence of FA,\ni.e. aj = bj . Since we are interested in investigating the\n6 T. Butterley et al.\neffect of FA on SPLASH this is a reasonable assumption,\nproviding that the number of reconstructed modes is lim-\nited sufficiently to avoid significant fitting error. Thus the\ndiagonals of the matrices C\u2032 and C\u2032\u2032 are equal to the val-\nues \u3008ajb\n\u2032\nj\u3009 and \u3008b\n\u20322\nj \u3009 respectively, which are the unknowns\nrequired in Equation 10.\nThe matrices G, G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 are constructed by map-\nping tilt covariances for pairs of apertures with appropriate\nspatial separations into square arrays which use the same\nsubaperture geometry along both axes as the subaperture\naxis of theD-matrices. An efficient method of calculating the\ntilt covariance between two spatially separated spatial aper-\ntures has been described by Asse\u00b4mat (2004). The tip\/tilt\ncovariances between subapertures i and l are given by\n\u3008gi,xgl,x\u3009 =\n1\n2d2\n[\n\u22022D\u03d5\n\u2202x2\n(x, y)\u2297 Iil(x, y)\n]\n(19)\n\u3008gi,xgl,y\u3009 =\n1\n2d2\n[\n\u22022D\u03d5\n\u2202x\u2202y\n(x, y)\u2297 Iil(x, y)\n]\n(20)\nwhere the x and y subscripts indicate the direction of the\ntilts. Iil(x, y) is the intercorrelation of the two aperture func-\ntions, defined by\nIil(x, y) =\n\u222b\u222b\n\u03a0\n(\nu+ x\nd\n,\nv + y\nd\n)\n\u03a0\n(\nu\nd\n,\nv\nd\n)\ndudv (21)\nwhere d is the subaperture size and \u03a0(x, y) is the aperture\nfunction, given by\n\u03a0(x, y) = 1 |x| < 1\/2 and |y| < 1\/2\n= 0 otherwise.\n(22)\nD\u03d5 is the phase structure function which, assuming Kol-\nmogorov turbulence with an infinitely large outer scale, is\ngiven by\nD\u03d5(x, y) = 6.88r\n\u22125\/3\n0 (x\n2 + y2)5\/6. (23)\nWhen one or both of the subapertures are affected by FA,\none of the following equations is used:\nI \u2032il(x, y) =\n\u222b\u222b\n\u03a0\n(\nu+ x\nd\n,\nv + y\nd\n)\n\u03a0\n(\nu\n\u03b2d\n,\nv\n\u03b2d\n)\ndudv (24)\nI \u2032\u2032il(x, y) =\n\u222b\u222b\n\u03a0\n(\nu+ \u03b2x\n\u03b2d\n,\nv + \u03b2y\n\u03b2d\n)\n\u03a0\n(\nu\n\u03b2d\n,\nv\n\u03b2d\n)\ndudv(25)\nwhere \u03b2 is an FA factor, defined by\n\u03b2 = 1\u2212\nh\nH\n. (26)\nThus we have all the information required to predict the\nresidual wavefront variance for a given number of corrected\nZernike modes. We have assumed the cone geometry shown\nin Fig. 1, and that the system is capable of perfectly correct-\ning Zernike modes to the degree that they can be sensed. We\nalso assume that tip and tilt across the full telescope aper-\nture can be perfectly sensed, since in reality these modes\nwould be sensed using a NGS rather than the laser beacon.\nThe results of the theoretical analysis of SPLASH are\nshown in Fig. 4. The benefits of the better sampling of the\nwavefront provided by SPLASH can clearly be seen in the\nplot. The fractional residual variance in each mode (i.e. the\nproportion of the variance in each mode that cannot be\nsensed and corrected) is roughly constant at each spatial\nscale for SPLASH, whereas the effect of FA on a conventional\nLGS becomes more severe as the spatial frequency of the\naberrations increases. The results indicate that a SPLASH\nsystem could be expected to perform significantly better\nthan an equivalent system using a conventional LGS with\na Shack-Hartmann WFS, and that the benefits are greater\nfor larger telescope apertures.\nIt is important to remember that we have ignored the\neffects of atmospheric aberrations on the downward path of\nthe light from the focused spots. These effects are included\nin the numerical simulation described in the next section.\n4 CLOSED LOOP SIMULATION\nA closed-loop semi-geometrical Monte Carlo simulation of\nSPLASH has also been implemented. This includes the ef-\nfects of aberrations on the return path of the light through\nthe atmosphere in addition to the upward-path FA consid-\nered in the theoretical analysis.\nFor the purposes of the simulation a uniform intensity\ndistribution was assumed for the laser beams, with each\nbeam being focused on the sky by a lens. The beacons were\nassumed to be sufficiently bright to ignore the effects of pho-\nton noise and CCD read noise.\nThe simulation assumes the diffraction-free geometry\nillustrated in figure 2 for the purposes of identifying the sec-\ntions of atmosphere intersected by the beams, but far-field\ndiffraction is included in the PSF calculations. For each sky\nspot, and at each time step, the phase aberration induced\non the upward path is calculated and the on-sky PSF is\ncalculated as a FFT of the complex amplitude across the\nsubaperture. Similarly, the phase aberration on the down-\nward path is projected onto the full telescope aperture and\nthe downward-propagation PSF is calculated as the FFT of\nthe complex amplitude across the telescope aperture. The\ntotal PSF (the LGS PSF imaged through the atmosphere)\nis calculated by convolving the upward and downward PSFs.\nThe simulated spots are centroided separately - they\nare not \u201cstitched\u201d together into a complete spot pattern. It\nis assumed that if the combination of the size and motion of\nthe spots is sufficient to cause cross-contamination, this can\nbe compensated for by time-interleaving of the spots.\nThe wavefront corrector used is an idealised segmented\ndeformable mirror (DM) consisting of square segments each\ncapable of correcting piston, tip and tilt. Each mirror seg-\nment is aligned perfectly with a SPLASH subaperture. The\nDM segment tip and tilt values correspond directly to the\ncorresponding spot x and y centroids, and the subaperture\npiston values across the DM are reconstructed from the cen-\ntroids using a successive over-relaxation (SOR) algorithm\n(Southwell 1980). As in the previous section, perfect (NGS)\nglobal tip\/tilt correction is assumed.\nThe atmospheric model used consists of two translating\nKolmogorov phase screens at different altitudes, with 60 per\ncent of the turbulence at the ground and the remaining 40\nper cent at one quarter of the altitude of the laser beacons.\nA range of different D\/r0 values were simulated and for each\none, the number of subapertures was matched to D\/r0, i.e.\nfor D\/r0 = 8, an 8 \u00d7 8 subaperture WFS (and DM) was\nused.\nA conventional LGS AO system with the same DM,\natmosphere model, beacon altitude, tip\/tilt correction, etc.\nA Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor projected onto the sky with reduced focal anisoplanatism 7\nFigure 4.

Future versions are expected to\ndo so (Basden et al. 2005).\nThe control loop was successfully closed for all the\nD\/r0 values simulated and the SPLASH results compared\nfavourably with the conventional LGS results, as can be seen\nin Figure 5. SPLASH performs considerably better than a\nconventional LGS system across the whole range of simu-\nlated values. The highest D\/r0 values simulated correspond\nto an 8 m class telescope, so the technique could be suitable\nfor use on existing telescopes.\nAs D\/r0 increases further, the residual wavefront error\nwill worsen and centroid anisoplanatism become more no-\nticeable. For sufficiently large D\/r0 the residual wavefront\nerror will prevent effective wavefront sensing, although the\nregime in which this occurs will be sensitive to the distribu-\ntion of turbulence in the atmosphere. Further simulations to\nhigher D\/r0 values (and with a range of atmosphere mod-\nels) are required to assess the applicability of the SPLASH\ntechnique to ELTs.\n5 CONCLUSION\nWe have described a new method of LGS wavefront sensing\nin which an array of Shack-Hartmann spots are projected\nonto the sky and then imaged through the telescope.\nWe have shown theoretically that, in the absence of any\nreturn-path wavefront aberrations, and assuming purely ge-\nometrical optics, such a system can be expected to suffer\nconsiderably less from FA than an equivalent conventional\nLGS system.\nWe have further demonstrated the validity of the tech-\nnique using a semi-geometrical closed-loop simulation with\na realistic atmosphere model, in which return-path aberra-\ntions were included in addition to upward-path turbulence.\nThis simulation demonstrates the improvement in perfor-\nmance over a conventional single-LGS AO system for a range\nof D\/r0 values up to those approximately consistent with an\n8 m class telescope.\nWe anticipate conducting further numerical simulation\nwork for larger aperture sizes to investigate the feasibility\nof the SPLASH technique for ELTs. It may also be possible\nto experimentally verify the technique on-sky in the coming\nmonths.\n6 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThanks to Franc\u00b8ois Asse\u00b4mat for drawing to our attention\nthe method for calculating subaperture tilt covariances.
