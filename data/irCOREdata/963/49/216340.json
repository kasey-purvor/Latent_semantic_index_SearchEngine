Email: e.neumayer@lse.ac.uk \n \n \n2 \nWhen members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) gather for their ministerial meet-\ning in Seattle from 30 November to 3 December 1999, the most fundamental question for \nthem to decide is whether or not to launch a new, so-called \u2018Millennium\u2019 round of trade \nnegotiations. The developed countries are all in favour of this new round, the most explicit \nand vocal supporters being the European Union and Japan. The developing countries are \nsplit: While most Latin American and some Asian countries support a new round, the ma-\njority of African and Asian countries \u2014 most notably Egypt, Zimbabwe, India, Bangla-\ndesh, Pakistan and Malaysia \u2014 are opposed. This opposition is shared by many develop-\nmental NGOs, some of which are indeed outspoken critics of virtually any form of market \nopening in developing countries \u2014 see, for example, the writings, speeches and position \npapers by Martin Khor, Director of the Malaysia-based Third World Network (Khor 1999). \nThose opposed to a new round of trade negotiations argue that the last, so-called Uru-\nguay round has been unbalanced in its beneficial effects for WTO member countries. The \ndeveloped countries, it is argued, have benefited quite substantially from including topics \nin the agreement that they favour: intellectual property rights, services, telecommunica-\ntions, restriction of production and export subsidies, increased access to developing coun-\ntries\u2019 markets, to mention just a few. The developing countries, on the other hand, are said \nto have hardly, if at all, benefited from trade liberalisation enacted by the Uruguay round \ntreaty that transformed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) into the \nWTO. Opponents to a new round of trade negotiations therefore demand that the old \nUruguay agreement is re-negotiated and re-balanced and that no new items are put on the \nagenda. In short, this viewpoint article will argue that while the critics are right to a great \nextent in maintaining that developing countries have not benefited as much from the Uru-\nguay round as they should have, it is in their best interest to support rather than resist a \n3 \nnew round of trade negotiations as this represents their only chance to get their fair share \nof benefits out of the international trade regime. \nHow do developing countries currently fare in the WTO? On paper they are privileged. \nThe WTO agreements of the Uruguay round guarantee them \u2018special and differential\u2019 \ntreatment (WTO 1999). Developed countries are encouraged to grant developing countries \ntrade preferences and a number of WTO agreements contain special provisions that are \nsupposed to safeguard developing countries\u2019 interests. For example, in the Agreement on \nTechnical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) the preparation and application of technical \nregulations and standards is supposed to take into account the special needs of developing \ncountries. The same applies to measures taken in pursuance of the Agreement on Sanitary \nand Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement). Furthermore, most of the WTO agreements \nallow developing countries a transitional period of grace until the provisions have to be \nimplemented. For example, in the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, \ndeveloping countries were given eight years for phasing out the relevant subsidies and a \nnumber of least developed countries and other poor developing countries with an annual \nper capita income of less then 1000 US$ were totally exempted from the prohibition of ex-\nport subsidies. Lastly, a couple of WTO agreements envisaged the provision of trade-\nrelated technical assistance to developing countries either by developed countries on a \nbilateral basis or through multilateral institutions. \nDeveloping countries welcomed their \u2018special and differential treatment\u2019 at the time of \nconclusion of the WTO agreements, but have by now grown disillusioned about their ac-\ntual effects. They rightly complain that the special provisions that were supposed to safe-\nguard their interests have been largely ineffectual in reality, that the transitional time peri-\nods were too short for them to adjust to the requirements of the WTO agreements and that \nthe promised technical assistance was too little and too unsystematic to strengthen their \n4 \ncapacity to comply with trade obligations. In a high level symposium on trade and devel-\nopment held by the WTO in Geneva on 17-18 March 1999, developing countries were \nunited in their suggestion that by and large \u2018special and differential treatment\u2019 has proved \nto be a \u2018dead letter\u2019 (ICTSD 1999). \nThis does not mean, however, that developing countries have not benefited at all from \nthe Uruguay Round. Substantial gains have already arisen and are bound to rise further \nover time due to the gradual phasing in of agriculture and textiles into the WTO for which \ndeveloping countries have a clear comparative advantage. They have also benefited from \na further clarification and formalisation of dispute settlement rules, including some special \nprovisions for developing countries, such as participation of a panelist from the develop-\ning world upon a developing country\u2019s request and provision of qualified legal assistance \nto developing countries. This has led to increased participation from a broader range of \ndeveloping countries trying to defend their trade rights, whereas the former GATT dis-\npute settlement was mostly only invoked by large developing countries such as Argentina, \nBrazil, Chile, Hong Kong and India (Kuruvila 1997). It is encouraging to see that an Advi-\nsory Centre on WTO Law, which will provide legal expertise and training to developing \ncountries, is now supported by enough WTO member countries to make its full establish-\nment by the end of 1999 likely (Anonymous 1999a). Especially very poor countries have \nalways demanded this legal assistance to help them realise their rights. \nNevertheless, it seems fair to say that the developed countries have benefited much \nmore relative to developing countries from the Uruguay round, a conclusion that was ten-\ntatively accepted even by WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero at the mentioned high \nlevel symposium on trade and development (ICTSD 1999). Given this imbalance, it is un-\nderstandable why India and other developing countries want to resist a new trade round \nand want to merely re-negotiate existing agreements in their favour. But is this also a vi-\n5 \nable political strategy? Presumably not. Why should the developed countries make any \nconcessions if any benefit to them is automatically excluded by banning from the agenda \nall issues such as investment, competition policy and government procurement in which \nthey have a special interest? Only if the developing countries constructively, but critically, \nsupport a new comprehensive trade round will they also be able to push for provisions \nthat are in their favour. These can either consist of a rectification of existing agreements or \nthe negotiation of new provisions. Developing countries should push for the removal of \npersisting impediments to market access for goods in which they have a particular export \ninterest such as agriculture, textiles, leather, clothes and footwear. These impediments ex-\nist in the form of escalating tariffs, which discourage the manufacturing and processing of \nraw materials in developing countries, tariff peaks and non-tariff barriers. They should \nalso push for restrictions on the use of so-called anti-dumping actions by developed coun-\ntries that are often protectionist measures in disguise and for openness, certainty and \ntransparency on the use of environmental measures for restricting market access, espe-\ncially in the form of ecolabelling. \nThe chances that the developing countries might be able to secure substantial benefits \nfor them in a new trade round are not too bad. For example, as concerns agriculture, the \ndeveloping world can count in many aspects on the United States to press for reduced \nsubsidies in the European Union, Japan and other high protectionist countries, while keep-\ning protections in the poorest countries which cannot afford to import food in times of cri-\nsis. The US representative at the high level symposium also assured developing countries \nthat the United States would be willing to consider increased market access for developing \ncountries\u2019 industrial goods (ICTSD 1999, p. 3). Similarly, the developed countries seem to \nbe open towards considering duty free market access for exports from least developed \ncountries, even at an early stage of a new trade round, and to be open towards further \n6 \ndebt reliefs, even if these are not strictly within the scope of the WTO. It is certainly true \nthat a new comprehensive trade round with a multitude of potential new obligations \nwould further increase the pressure on the limited institutional capacity of developing \ncountries to comply with these obligations. On the other hand, because developed coun-\ntries are aware of this, a new trade round might provide a unique chance to push through \ncommitments for effectual, substantial and systematic assistance for capacity building and \ntechnology transfer. \nThe developing countries should seize the opportunity to signal to the developed coun-\ntries that they are willing to support a new comprehensive round of trade negotiations, \nbut only under certain conditions. Only such constructive, but critical, support makes a re-\nbalancing of the benefits from the Uruguay round possible and a realisation of further \nbenefits likely. A total resistance will not rectify any past imbalances and will prove a self-\ndefeating strategy in the long run. What is important, however, is that alongside such ne-\ngotiations, which are expected to take several years until conclusion, there should be a \ncomprehensive assessment of the social and economic effects on developing countries of \nthe Uruguay trade round and of the likely effects of any new negotiations, inclusive of an \nenvironmental and gender analysis. Only such an assessment will show which provisions \nare most in need of rectification and where substanital improvements have to be achieved. \nThe WTO secretariat is currently in the process of preparing a paper on the review of \u2018spe-\ncial and differential treatment\u2019 provisions (Anonymous 1999b). But this can only amount \nto a first step towards a comprehensive assessment that looks at the full socio-economic \ndimensions. Developing countries and developmental NGOs like Oxfam and the Interna-\ntional Coalition for Development Action should close ranks and do their best that the new \n\u2018Millenium\u2019 round of trade negotiations gives the poor and disadvantaged of this world \ntheir fair share of the benefits of the international trade regime. \n7 \n \nReferences \nAnonymous (1999a): WTO in brief, BRIDGES Weekly Trade News Digest 3 (21), 31 May \n1999 \nAnonymous (1999b): WTO committee on trade and development disusses special and dif-\nferential treatment, BRIDGES Weekly Trade News Digest 3 (22), 7 June 1999 \nICTSD (1999): Report on the WTO's High-Level Symposium on Trade and Development, Ge-\nneva, 17-18 March 1999, online available at \nhttp:\/\/www.wto.org\/wto\/hlms\/sumhlenv.htm \nKhor, Martin (1999): New battles begin soon in the World Trade Organization (WTO), \nThird World Resurgence, March issue, online available at http:\/\/www.twnside.org.sg\/ \nKuruvila, Pretty Elizabeth (1997): Developing countries and the GATT\/WTO dispute set-\ntlement mechanism, Journal of World Trade 31 (6), pp. 171-208 \nWTO (1999): Background Document for High Level Symposium on Trade and Development, Ge-\nneva, 17-18 March 1999, Geneva: World Trade Organization, online available at \nhttp:\/\/www.wto.org \n"}
