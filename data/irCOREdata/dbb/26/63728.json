Significant decreases in the \nratios of chlorophylls a to b, an increase in the carbon to nitrogen (C\/N) ratio, and a \nreduction of maximum quantum yield of PS II (Fv\/Fm) in pine needles were observed \nafter the 2 months fumigation. Cation contents of pine needles were also decreased by \nthe fumigation with HONO gas. The results could be explained by the harmful effects of \nOH radicals, generated from photolysis of HONO gas, and\/or aqueous phase HONO \n(NO2-\/HONO), on the photosynthetic capacity of pine needles. \n \n1. Introduction \nNitrous acid (HONO) in the atmosphere is generated from heterogeneous reactions of \nnitrogen dioxide (NO2) and water on ground surfaces such as soil, walls of buildings \nand airborne particle surfaces( 3222 HNOHONOOHNO\nsurface +\u23af\u23af \u2192\u23af+ ), and as direct \nemissions from automobile exhausts (Lammel and Cape, 1996). Photolysis of HONO \ngas (HONO+h\u03bd\u2192\uff65OH+NO) is a source of hydroxyl radical (\uff65OH), the most important \noxidant in the troposphere. Concentrations of HONO gas in ambient air are reported to \nbe 0.1-10 ppb (parts in 109 by volume) in urban areas and 0.01-1 ppb in rural and \nremote areas (Lammel and Cape, 1996). Night-time concentrations of up to 5 ppb \n(Zhang et al., 2003) have been reported, with mean values of 2 ppb and maxima of over \n8 ppb in urban areas (Bari et al., 2003). Due to its rapid decomposition by sunlight, \nHONO gas is present at higher concentrations at night, with lower but not zero \nconcentrations in daytime. Uptake of HONO gas by higher plants is proportional to \nHONO concentrations and linearly related to stomatal conductance, limited by diffusion \nof HONO through stomata (Schimang et al., 2006). However, effects of HONO gas on \nhigher plants are not yet known because long term fumigation experiments with HONO \ngas on higher plants have not been conducted; the high instability of HONO gas to solar \nradiation largely inhibits the determination of any cause-effect relationship from field \nstudies. This experiment examined the effects of HONO gas on Scots pine trees using \nopen top chambers for fumigation. \n2. Methodology \n2.1. Chamber experiments \nOpen top chambers (OTCs: 3m height and 3m diameter, with glass walls and with the \ntop open to the atmosphere), situated at the field experimental facilities at the Edinburgh \nResearch Station, CEH, were used for fumigating 4-year old Scots pine trees (Pinus \nsylvestris L.) with HONO. Each of 6 chambers contained 6 Scots pine saplings in pots \nin a peat:loam:grit (3:2:1 by volume) mixture, regularly watered, and exposed to \nambient rainfall. Ambient air, pre-treated with charcoal filters, was introduced into the \nOTCs from an internal perforated polyethylene torus mounted above the plants at a flow \nrate of ca.14 m3 min-1. Fumigations of 0, ca.2.5 or ca.5.0 ppb HONO gas were carried \nout from 18:00 to 6:00 every day during two months (July\u2013September) in 2003. Sunrise \nand sunset times during the experimental period were 3-5 am and 7-9 pm, respectively, \nat the site and thus the fumigation was conducted not only at night but also at low light \nintensity periods at dusk and dawn. During the exposure experiment, average air \ntemperature (24 h), solar radiation at noon, and total precipitation amount were 13.1\u2103, \n0.45 kW m-2, and 194 mm. Measurements of the photolysis rate of NO2 (jNO2) inside \nand outside the OTCs during the exposure experiment indicated that light intensity in \nthe chamber (at jNO2 wavelengths) was on average 33% of outdoors; transmission of \ntotal solar radiation, as measured by a Kipp-type solarimeter, was 85%. \n2.2. Preparation of HONO gas \nHONO gas was generated by a method similar to that of Taira and Kanda (1990). \nDilute solutions of sodium nitrite and sulphuric acid were separately pumped by a \nperistaltic pump at a flow rate of ca 0.1ml min-1 into the two side ports of a 4-port \nreaction tube (ca 1.0 ml internal volume) where they were mixed together. By changing \nthe sulphuric acid concentrations, ca.2.5 and ca.5.0 ppb of HONO gas (with \u00b110% \nvariation of the generation rate) were produced in the generation system. Ambient air, \npassed through charcoal and silica gel columns using an air pump, was used for carrier \ngas at a flow rate of 0.4-0.5 l min-1, which entered the reaction tube by the bottom port. \nHONO vapour was transferred to the carrier air flow during passage through a stripping \ncoil (4mm i.d. x 25mm coil diameter x 60mm coil length) while waste solution was \npumped out by the peristaltic pump from the end of the stripping coil. The HONO gas \ngenerated in the stripping coil was introduced into the main air supply of the OTCs \nthrough PTFE tubing, which was completely encased in black plastic tubing to prevent \nHONO photolysis. HNO3, NO and NO2 can be by-products of HONO generation in \nsuch a system; the higher HONO treatment (5 ppb) was associated with a concentration \nof NO around 25 ppb, but negligible amounts of NO2 and HNO3 were detected (see \nbelow). \n2.3. Analytical methods \nTotal NOx concentrations were monitored continuously in one fumigated chamber by \na chemiluminescent NOx monitor (Monitor Labs 8840), and air in all chambers was \nsampled regularly using a cylindrical denuder coated in Na2CO3 and analysed by ion \nchromatography (Metrohm) for NO2- and NO3-. HONO gas concentrations in the \nchambers were calculated from the NO2- concentrations and volume of air passed \nthrough the denuder. Measured HONO concentrations during fumigation were 2.3 (\u00b1 \n0.4) and 4.7 (\u00b1 0.5) ppb for the two treatments; the uncertainty is the range of the \nduplicate chambers. Nitrate concentrations (from HNO3) were less than 15% of the \nmeasured nitrite concentrations (from HONO). Any contribution from NO2 to nitrite \nconcentrations would have been small because of the low concentrations of NO2 (<10 \nppb, not related to the fumigation treatment). \nThe maximum quantum yield of PS II (Fv\/Fm) was evaluated by measuring \nchlorophyll fluorescence using a portable chlorophyll fluorometer (MINI-PAM, Heinz \nWalz GmbH, Effeltrich), with 4 clips per tree and 12 min dark adaptation. The C and N \ncontents of needles were measured by an elemental analyzer (CHN-2000II, Perkin \nElmer) after freeze-drying the needles. Chlorophyll contents were determined by \ncolorimetry at 720 nm (blank), 664 and 647 nm after solvent extraction (0.1g fresh wt \nneedles in 3 ml dimethylformamide for 4 days at room temperature). Cation contents \nwere analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry \n(Optima3000, Perkin Elmer) after needle samples were pre-treated with chloroform for \n2 min to remove surface deposits then digested in a microwave system with HNO3. All \nmeasurements were made on current-year needles, sampled at the end of the experiment \n(September). \n3. Results and Discussion \n3.1. Overall results \nAfter 2 months fumigation with HONO gas, a significant decrease of photosynthetic \ncapacity was detected from the decreased chlorophyll a content and maximum quantum \nyield of PS II (Fv\/Fm) in needles (Table 1), while the overall content of chlorophyll a+b \nwas unchanged by the HONO fumigation and thus the ratio of chlorophyll a to \nchlorophyll b was significantly reduced. Moreover, considering the increased C\/N ratios \nobserved, it is likely that there was a reduction in the needle content of proteins such as \nRubisco. \nA decreasing trend in Ca, Na, Fe and Al concentrations in the pine needles with \nincreasing HONO fumigation was observed, while K and Mg concentrations showed no \ntrend. Results of the cation analysis indicate that: 1) supply of nutrients from roots may \nbe reduced due to damage to root system, and\/or 2) cation leaching was increased from \nneedles fumigated with HONO gas. \n3.2. Mechanisms of damage \u2013 role of OH radicals \nThese results, especially the decreasing trend of the ratio of chlorophyll a to b, and \nPSII (Fv\/Fm), indicate that the primary process of photosynthesis was damaged by \nHONO fumigation. The damage caused by HONO could be explained by harmful \neffects of OH radicals generated by sunlight irradiation of HONO. Even though the \nfumigation was mostly at night, to mimic the pattern of exposure seen in the atmosphere, \neven the low levels of UV irradiance through the glass walls of the OTCs at dawn and \ndusk would have generated OH radicals from gas-phase HONO, and also from HONO \nadsorbed on leaf surfaces or dissolved in surface humidity. Similar effects have been \nobserved in experiments in which young Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora) plants \nwere exposed to OH radicals (Kobayashi et al., 2002; Nakatani, 2004; Chiwa et al., \n2005). \nIn theory HONO might act as both a source of OH radical and a fertilizer for higher \nplants. Fertilizer effects of HONO on the physiological status of higher plants could be \nimportant because, after uptake of HONO gas through stomata, nitrite (the direct \nproduct of HONO in solution) could be quickly metabolized (Schimang et al., 2006). \nHowever, in this study there was no evidence of HONO gas acting as a fertilizer, \nbecause the C:N ratio increased, rather than any decrease that might have been expected \nif HONO (or trace contamination by HNO3) had acted as a source of nutrient N. \nSeveral factors could have been involved in determining the observed HONO effects \non pine needles: \n1) HONO gas and\/or NO2-\/HONO, deposited on plant surfaces, were quickly \nphotodecomposed into OH radical, or reacted with water and HNO3 on the surfaces of \nplants and chamber walls, and thus any fertilizer effects of HONO were negligible; \n2) Stomatal closure at night, during our fumigation, protected plants from the entry of \nNO2-\/HONO into the mesophyll air space and thus minimized the fertilizer effects of \nNO2-\/HONO; or \n3) Even if a portion of HONO gas was deposited on the needle surfaces and penetrated \nthrough stomata during daytime, the fertilizer effects of NO2-\/HONO were \noverwhelmed by harmful effects of OH radicals. Acidified needle surface wetness \ncould have played an important role in the photo-generation of OH radicals and also in \nthe process causing damage to pine needles. \n4. Conclusions \nAs far as the authors are aware this is the first study that shows the harmful effects of \natmospheric HONO on higher plants at concentrations that are present in polluted air. \nThe average exposure concentrations over the whole period (fumigation for 12 h d-1) \nwere close to 1.25 and 2.5 ppb, which are within the range of average measured urban \nvalues. Although plants were exposed simultaneously to up to 25 ppb NO during \nfumigation, this would be usual for conditions in which HONO concentrations of a few \nppb are found, i.e. in urban areas at night. The two-month average concentration of NO \n(day and night) was around half the fumigation value (12 h d-1), and below any \nconcentration expected to have an effect on plants (WHO, 1997). \nAtmospheric OH radicals may be not only the \u201cvacuum cleaner\u201d for cleaning the \natmosphere but may also be detrimental to plant life. Studies on the mechanisms of \nHONO effects and fumigations of various higher plants are now required. \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Dr. Lucy Sheppard and Mr. Ian Leith for kind assistance with the OTC \nexperiment.
