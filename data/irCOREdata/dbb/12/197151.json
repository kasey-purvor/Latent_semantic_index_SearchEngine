Truthful? \n \n \nA passenger arriving at London airports and passing the immigration check is greeted by \nanti-trafficking posters that tell the story of deceit and forced prostitution and call on \npassengers to seek help from the immigration officers in case they have been brought into \nthe UK against their will. Once in the UK, one is confronted with similar campaigns but \nthis time of a slightly different message; a campaign such as Blue Blindfolds calls on the \ngeneral public across the UK to share any suspicions or information on cases of \ntrafficking with the police or the Home Office.1 During the last decade, anti-trafficking \ninformation campaigns have played a prominent part in anti-trafficking policies \nthroughout Europe. They have for the most part been launched in migrants\u2019 counties of \norigin with the idea of warning migrants about the dangers of irregular migration. \nScholars have taken interest in those campaigns and argued that despite the best \nintentions, those campaigns aim at reducing irregular migration, encourage women to \nstay at home, promote stereotypes about \u2018eastern\u2019 European societies as patriarchal and \ncrime-ridden and of women as na\u00efve victims (Nieuwenhuys and P\u00e9coud, 2007; Sharma, \n2003). Feminist scholars have moreover put into question the category of a \u2018victim\u2019, \ncritiqued a slippage between \u2018illegal immigration\u2019, \u2018forced prostitution\u2019, and \u2018trafficking\u2019, \nand argued that these conflations divert attention from the role of the state (O\u2019Connell \nDavidson, 2006). \n \nFor those scholars working at the intersection of academia and policy, the question has \noften been how to bring this type of critical analysis to the attention of policy makers and \nhow to find common ground (and language) in order to address problematic aspects of \nanti-trafficking campaigns. Having written about the campaigns myself, I noticed that in \nmy consultations with policy makers, I tended to privilege the debate over restrictive \nimmigration laws and hold back on considerations regarding representations of women\u2019s \nbodies. Why would a policy maker be remotely interested in a claim that anti-trafficking \ninformation campaigns eroticise and fetishize women\u2019s bodies (Andrijasevic, 2007)? My \nassumptions were proven wrong during the debate with the head of the International \nOrganisation for Migration\u2019s anti-trafficking unit, the very unit that was overseeing the \nrealisation of the campaigns I wrote about.2 The point on erotisation was of great interest \n                                                \n1\n http:\/\/www.blueblindfold.co.uk\/index.php  \n2\n The debate between Richard Danziger and Rutvica Andrijasevic took place at the Kitson Club in Paris \n(14.09.2007). \nand concern and seen as crucial in rethinking the conceptualisation of the anti-trafficking \nwork. This event has strengthened my conviction for the need of interventions that ensure \nthat gender research influences policy development and implementation. Some arguments \nsuch as those about the rights of irregular migrants might seem difficult to advance, \nespecially given the current political climate, and some academic considerations, such as \nthose concerned with the demand for gendered and racialised workers, might appear \ndifficult to translate into the language of policy. Yet, as the text below delivered by \nBridget Anderson at the United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking \n(UN- GIFT) Conference in Vienna on 13-15 February 2008 shows, making those \narguments is crucial in order to broaden our understanding of structural injustices and \ndomination as well as develop alternative forms of knowledge and of action. \n \n \nAnti-trafficking information campaigns have tended very much to concentrate in source \ncountries where the principle audience is imagined as being people potentially vulnerable \nto trafficking. Let us turn our attention to destination countries where campaigns focus \neither on \u2018demand\u2019 or on recognition (or both).  \n \nDemand \nCampaigns that target \u2018demand\u2019 have two potential targets for these messages, the \nconsumers of goods and services produced or performed by trafficked people, and the \nemployers or labour users of trafficked people. However, a key challenge for this \napproach is that we cannot target employer demand for \u2018trafficked labour\u2019 per se, nor \nconsumer demand for goods or services produced or performed by trafficked people. \nThere is demand for cheap and exploitable labour that undercuts minimum labour \nstandards, working excessive hours for low wages; and there is a demand for foreign \nnationals, because they are easier to control. Non-citizens may be easier to retain if they \nare tied by immigration status for example, or if they are working illegally. Even abusive \nlabour users do not necessarily equate their requirement for cheap labour with a demand \nfor trafficked labour, rather they simply feel they are responding to the requirements of \nthe market. In the same way, while there is a demand for embodied and controllable \nservices, and for cheap products, this can\u2019t be equated with a demand for trafficked \ngoods.  \n \nThis is an example of where the interest in trafficking for the purposes of prostitution and \nmodelling of responses based on this model facilitates a certain sleight of hand. While \nthere are those who argue that the abolition of prostitution will ensure there is no \ntrafficked labour in the sex sector, in general the advocating of elimination of entire \nsectors in order to deal with exploitation and abuse is problematic for all kinds of reasons. \nOne can scarcely eliminate agriculture, or domestic work, two sectors that are infamous \nin the levels and degree of exploitation that occur in them. Tackling the multi-faceted \nnature of this kind of demand through \u2018anti-trafficking\u2019 responses alone risks missing the \npoint. It requires an approach that combats labour exploitation, racism and \ndiscrimination, deeply rooted in our economies and societies. Anti-trafficking measures \nand messages tackling demand must be consistent with broader sets of policies that \ndemonstrate intolerance of exploitation, racism and discrimination. \n Recognition \nAnother aim of campaigns is to focus on raising awareness. There are generally two \nbroad audiences for awareness raising: specific types of officials who are thought likely \nto come across trafficked people such as police, immigration officers, social workers etc \nand the general public. The problem is that \u2018victim of trafficking\u2019 is both a descriptive \nterm applied by NGOs, the media and other civil society actors to people who have \ncertain sets of experiences \u2013 though exactly what should constitute those sets of \nexperiences is contested and an administrative category entailing certain state protections \nand obligations towards individuals under the law as formally enacted. The identification \nof a \u2018Victim of Trafficking\u2019 (VoT) such that they \u2018fit\u2019 the administrative category is \nnotoriously difficult, and though much is made of the distinction between trafficked and \nsmuggled persons, the instrumentalising of these concepts has exercised lawyers, \nacademics and frontline officials alike.  \n \nSo while the media has in many countries raised the profile of trafficking and ensured \nthat the general public is aware of the problem, this is very much on the understanding of \ntrafficking as a descriptive term. The Blue Blindfold campaign aims to raise awareness of \nthe nature and extent of human trafficking, and help members of the public to \u2018spot \nvictims\u2019. The signs listed in February 2008 included \u201cindicators of trafficking\u201d that might \napply to many, mainly migrants. Even migrants with legal status, are often \u201cafraid of \nsaying what their immigration status is\u201d, and indeed may be \u201cdistrustful of authority\u201d. In \nfact this distrust can be a very active factor in \u2018information campaigns\u2019 as migrants do not \nnecessarily trust messages that are brought to them by receiving states. As for \u201cvery poor \nworking conditions\u201d, excessive working hours, below subsistence wages, disregard of \nhealth and safety for migrant labour are regularly reported in the media. But focussing on \nrecognition by members of the public inevitably relies on trafficking as a descriptive \nterm.  \n \nThis is not surprising as even government ministers can fall into using the term \ndescriptively: \u201cthree quarters of illegal immigrants to Britain are trafficked\u201d, the British \nHome Office Minister stated in March 2007. Should these three quarters attempt to count \nas trafficked administratively for the purpose of state protection, they might find the term \nused somewhat more rigorously. Just because a member of the public has \u2018spotted\u2019 a \ntrafficked person does not mean that they will be legally entitled to victim status. Not all \nthose horrendously abused or caught in what some people describe as \u2018modern day \nslavery\u2019 will count administratively as victims of trafficking even when they are migrants \nwho are grossly exploited. That is, as the figures demonstrate, there is a lack of fit \nbetween descriptive and administrative categories. The consequences, for those who may \nfit the descriptive but not the administrative categories, are that the promises that \u201cyou \nhave nothing to fear from the authorities\u201d are simply not true.   \n \nRights \nThis raises the question of rights, redress and power. What are your rights, and where you \ncan turn for help is crucial information for anybody, but particularly for those who are \nvulnerable because they are in an unfamiliar situation. However, this step forward raises \nreal challenges for receiving states and civil society. Firstly, such an approach requires a \ndifferentiation between acceptable and unacceptable \u2018exploitation\u2019 and the danger is that \nonce that line is drawn, anything on one side of it becomes acceptable, \u2018not so bad\u2019. \nMessages need to avoid a perverse \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 where only those who are most \nabused and exploited count, and those for example who are \u2018only\u2019 not paid a wage can be \nrepresented as complaining about a minor infringement if, for example, they have not \nbeen physically beaten.  \n \nHierarchies of suffering may reflect more the preconceptions and feelings of those who \ndevise them than those who experience them. But workers, migrant or not, cannot be \ndivided into two entirely separate and distinct groups \u2013 those who are trafficked \ninvoluntarily into the misery of slavery in an illegal economic sector, and those who \nvoluntarily and legally work in the happy and protected world of the formal economy. \nViolence, confinement, coercion, deception and exploitation can and do occur within \nboth legally regulated and irregular systems of work. How to draw a line in the sand \nbetween \u2018trafficked\u2019 and \u2018not trafficked but just-the-regular-kind-of-exploitation\u2019 \nmigrants? How exploited does a migrant have to be to count as \u2018trafficked\u2019 (Anderson \nand O\u2019Connell Davidson 2002)? But this simple response opens a much more serious \nproblem, as in many states certain categories of migrant labour have very limited \nemployment rights, even when they are working legally. For those who are working in \nbreach of conditions, or who are overstayers, rights may be severely curtailed. It is legal \nto discriminate against migrant workers, quite simply because they are not-citizens. There \nis perversely a danger then of institutionalizing lower standards for migrant labour \nthrough focusing on trafficking rather than on equal implementation of labour standards \nand access to redress crimes against the person. Moreover, the fear of removal is actively \nused by exploitative employers in order to control migrants, including those with legal \nstatus. While threat of denunciation to the authorities may be evidence of a forced labour \nrelation, the fact remains that such threats are enforced by the state, usually seen to \nintervene on the part of employers rather than of exploited migrants. Abusive employers\u2019 \nmessages, while not decent, are honest and truthful. Is it any wonder that migrants \ndistrust state authorities and fear the police? \n \nIt is the relation of migrants, whatever their status, to the state that gives rise to many of \nthe difficulties and challenges faced by migrants. I would propose two kinds of action: \nfirstly the importance of facilitating collective action and organising, of moving beyond \nthe victim model; and secondly the removal of fear of deportation. We must disentangle \nlabour and rights protection from immigration control. Otherwise, it is only the abusive \nemployer\u2019s message \u201cYou\u2019ll be deported if you don\u2019t do what I say\u201d that is consistent \nand truthful. As it is, we need to take a long hard look at the role that the state plays in \nconstructing categories of people who are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, through \nits labour and immigration legislation.  \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nAnderson, B. and J.
