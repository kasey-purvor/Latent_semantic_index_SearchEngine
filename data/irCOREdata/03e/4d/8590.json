INTRODUCTION.\nEvidence that the nucleon-nucleon force is charge independent can be found in the energy\nspectra of nuclei in a T=1 isobaric triplet where states with the same spin, parity and\nquite similar energy are observed. An example is shown in Figure 1 where the first excited\n2+T=1 states for members of the A=38 isobaric triplet (\n38\n18Ar20(Tz=+1),\n38\n19K19(Tz=0) and\n38\n20Ca18(Tz=-1)) are plotted. Tz is defined as (N-Z)\/2.\n0\n2 2167\n3\n0\n1\n2 2404\n0\n2 2206\n2167\n1944\n2273\n2206\nT=1\nT=1\nT=1\nT=1\nT=1\nT=1\n19K1918Ar20 20Ca18\n383838\nT=0\nT=0\nFIG. 1: The first excited 2+T=1 states for nuclei in the A=38 isobaric triplet.\nA more rigorous test of the wavefunctions of the 2+T=1 states can be made by consid-\nering the transition probablility of transitions to the 0+T=1 states. The reduced transition\nprobability is related to the partial \u03b3-ray lifetime (\u03c4\u03b3) by:\nB(E2, Ei \u2192 Ef ) =\n1\n1.22\u00d7 109E5\u03b3 \u00d7 \u03c4\u03b3\n(e2(fm)4) (1)\nwhere \u03c4\u03b3 is in seconds and E\u03b3 is the transition energy, measured in MeV, and to the matrix\nelement (Mp) by:\nMp = [(2Ji + 1)\u00d7B(E2, Ei \u2192 Ef )]\n1\/2(e(fm)2). (2)\nFigure 2 shows the values of Mp for the 2\n+\nT=1 \u2192 0\n+\nT=1 transitions for members of the A=22-\n42 T=1 triplets plotted as a function of isospin Tz. Two features are immediately evident\n2\nfrom these plots, one is that for all triplets, with the exception of A = 38, the values of\nMp decrease as Tz increases. The second is that the data point for\n38K is two standard\ndeviations from the value expected by assuming a linear dependence. This latter point was\nhighlighted in a recent paper by Cottle et al [4].\nThe data presented in Figure 2 hints at broken isospin symmetry in the A=38 triplet and\nhas provided the motivation to re-measure the value of the matrix element in 38K. The value\nplotted in Figure 2 for 38K is taken from the weighted average of three measurements of the\nlifetime of the 2+T=1 state (72\u00b117 fs) [7\u20139] and the branching ratios for the 2273 keV (6\u00b12)\nand 1944 keV (94\u00b12) [7, 10] transitions from this state as shown in Figure 1. The Doppler\nShift Attenuation Method (DSAM) was used to make previous measurements of the lifetime\nof excited states in 38K [7\u20139] and was considered the most appropriate tool for this study.\nThe existence of an yrast, isomeric (\u03c4=32(1)\u00b5s) Jpi=7+ state at \u223c3.5 MeV [11] precludes the\nuse of a fusion-evaporation reaction to populate the state of interest. Therefore the (d,\u03b1)\nreaction was used.\n-1 0 1\nTZ\n0\n10\n20\n30M\np(e\n(fm\n)2 )\nA=34\n0\n10\n20\n30 A=22\n-1 0 1\nTZ\nA=42\nA=26\n1-1 0\nTZ\nA=38\nA=30\nFIG. 2: Matrix elements for the 2+T=1\u2192 0\n+\nT=1 transition in T=1 triplets from A=22 to A=42.

For some nuclei ( Tz=1 and\n30P ) the error bar is smaller than the data point.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE.\nStates in 38K were populated using the 40Ca(d,\u03b1) reaction at a beam energy of 4.5 MeV.\nGiven that the reaction has a positive Q value, the beam energy was chosen to be as low\n3\nas possible, in order to minimise side feeding. The beam of deuterons was accelerated by\nthe ESTU tandem accelerator [12] at the Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale\nUniversity. The 220 \u00b5g\/cm2 40Ca target was supported on a 1 mg\/cm2 Ni backing and had\na flash of gold on the front face to prevent oxidation. The deuteron beam lost \u223c15 keV in\nreaching the centre of the target [13] and the maximum 38K recoil energy was calculated\nusing the reaction kinematics code CatKin [14] to be 2 MeV. A recoil of this energy would\nbe stopped in the nickel backing.\n\u03b3 rays were measured in an array of 8 Clover detectors, 4 at an angle in the horizontal\nplane (\u03b8) with respect to the beam direction of 140\u25e6 with angles in the vertical plane (\u03c6) of\n0\u25e6, 90\u25e6, 180\u25e6 and 270\u25e6 and 4 with \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 and \u03c6 = 80\u25e6, 160\u25e6, 200\u25e6 and 280\u25e6. Energy and\nefficiency calibrations were performed with sources of 152Eu and 226Ra. The 226Ra source\nwas used because it emits \u03b3 rays up to 2446 keV.\nThe SCARY array of Solar cells [15] was used to detect the \u03b1 particles. It consists of\n8 detectors centred at \u03b8 =154\u25e6 with \u03c6 angles of 0\u25e6,45\u25e6,90\u25e6,135\u25e6,180\u25e6,225\u25e6,270\u25e6 and 315\u25e6.\nThe solar cells were calibrated with a 228Th source and were measured to have FWHM\nvalues of 150 keV at 5.4 MeV before the experiment, degrading slightly to 200 keV after the\nexperiment.\nTwo types of data were collected simultaneously:\n\u2022 Particle-\u03b3 coincidence events where a \u03b3 ray and a particle were observed within 400 ns\nof each other.\n\u2022 \u03b3-\u03b3 coincidence events in which the energy of each of a pair of \u03b3 rays observed within\n100 ns was recorded.\nEvents were written to disk for subsequent off-line analysis where they were sorted using\nthe CSCAN analysis package [16] into a variety of matrices. The Radware analysis soft-\nware package [17] has been used to analyse the data. Data from the particle-\u03b3 coincidence\nevents was used to construct 9 particle-energy, \u03b3-ray energy matrices, one for each of the\ncomposite angles between the solar cells and germanium detectors. The angles are 75\u25e6, 83\u25e6,\n95\u25e6,103\u25e6,123\u25e6,127\u25e6,137\u25e6,148\u25e6 and 155\u25e6. Data from the \u03b3-\u03b3 coincidence events was used to\nconstruct a \u03b3- \u03b3 matrix.\nThe lifetimes of the states were deduced by observing the \u03b3-ray Doppler shift which is\nrelated to the slowing down time of the recoil in the target backing. The Doppler effect is\n4\ngiven by\nE\u03b3 = E\u25e6\n\u221a\n1\u2212 v\n2\nc2\n1\u2212 v\nc\ncos \u03b8\n\u2248 E\u25e6(1 +\nv\u00af\nc\ncos \u03b8) (3)\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between the direction of the recoil and the direction of the \u03b3-ray\nemission, E\u25e6 is the \u03b3-ray energy when it is emitted when the nucleus is at rest and E\u03b3 is the\nenergy of the \u03b3 ray emitted when the nucleus is moving. In the DSAM, the average velocity\nv\u00af of the recoiling nucleus when the level decays is determined by plotting the \u03b3-ray energy\nE\u03b3 as a function of cos \u03b8. The unshifted energy (E\u25e6) and the average velocity v\u00af can then be\nobtained from the slope and intercept of this graph as shown in Equation 3. v\u00af is related to\nthe lifetime of decay of the excited state via the Doppler-Shift Attenuation Factor F (\u03c4) [18]\nwhich is given by\nF (\u03c4) =\nv\u00af\nv\u25e6\n=\n1\nv\u25e6\u03c4\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nv(t)exp(\u2212t\/\u03c4)dt (4)\nwhere v\u25e6 is the initial recoil velocity, v(t) is the recoil velocity as a function of time during\nthe slowing down process in the backing material and \u03c4 is the lifetime of the state. The\ninitial velocity (v\u25e6) for each level was determined using CatKin [14]. In this work the velocity\nprofiles have been obtained using a version of Dechist [19] modified to include the SRIM\n[13] stopping powers and the integration done numerically. The validity of the method was\nchecked by considering the lifetimes of states in 56Co produced via the (d,\u03b1) reaction on\nthe 58Ni target backing. Values of lifetimes obtained for the 1931, 2062, 2307, 2360 and\n2637 keV levels in 56Co were in agreement with previous work [20]. Further details can be\nfound in [21].\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS.\nThe partial level scheme of 38K observed in this experiment is shown in Figure 3. Table I\nlists the \u03b3-ray energies measured in the projection of a particle-\u03b3 matrix. \u03b3-ray branching\nratios have been measured by fitting the angular distribution data and allowing the popu-\nlation of the substates in the reaction and the \u03b3-ray intensity to vary as outlined in [22].\nThe intensities quoted are in broad agreement with those in Collins et al. [7] and Hasper et\nal. [10] except for the transitions depopulating the 3693 keV level where Collins et al. have\nthe 1044 keV transition being half as intense as the 1076 keV transition. This is opposite to\n5\nwhat is observed in the current work. For the 2404 keV level, Collins et al. [7] and Hasper et\nal. [10] quote branching ratios of 100\/6.4 and 100\/7.5 for the 1944 and 2273 keV transitions\nrespectively. Neither of the papers observed evidence for the 705 and 2404 keV transitions\nand, in the current work, a detailed analysis of the \u03b3-\u03b3 coincidence matrix was performed\nto get upper limits for these transitions.\nFIG. 3: Partial level scheme for 38K showing the excited states and transitions observed in this\nwork.\nThe particle-\u03b3 coincidence data was used to set gates on the \u03b1-particle energy so that\nthe contribution from side-feeding could be eliminated. Figure 4 shows the particle spectra\nmeasured in coincidence with the 2700, 1568 and 329 keV transitions. The spectra give an\nindication of the quality of the data and the \u03b1-particle energies measured are consistent\nwith those calculated using CatKin [14]. Figure 4c) is double peaked since the 459 keV\nlevel (from which the 329 keV transition decays) is fed both directly and indirectly from\nhigher lying states. Setting a gate on \u03b1-particle energies higher than \u223c5.5 MeV eliminates\nthe contribution to the measured lifetime of the level from side-feeding. Analysis of the\nparticle-\u03b3 data indicated that the statistics were sufficient to extract centroid shifts for\nseven transitions, namely the 426, 1267, 1568, 1944, 2273, 2536 and 2700 keV transitions\ndepopulating the five states listed in column 1 of Table II. Figure 5 shows the measured\nenergy of the 1944 keV transition as a function of cos\u03b8. The F(\u03c4) attenuation factors\nextracted using Equations 3 and 4 are listed in Table II. The attenuation factors for the\n2404 and 2830 keV excited states were determined by the weighted average between the\n6\n0 4000 8000 12000\nE\u03b1(keV)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n0\n20\n40\n60\nCo\nun\nts\n0\n20\nc)\nb)\na)\nFIG. 4: Particle spectra obtained by gating on a) the 2700 keV b) the 1568 keV and c) the 329\nkeV transitions depopulating the 2830, 1698 and 459 keV levels respectively.\nattenuation factors measured for the 1944 and 2273 keV transitions from the 2404 keV state\nand the 426 and 2700 keV transitions from the 2830 keV state.\nTable III lists the lifetimes extracted using Equation 4 along with previous results from\nCollins et al. [7], Hasper et al. [8] and Engmann et al. [9]. Collins et al. [7] used the (d,\u03b1)\nreaction but with a beam energy of 7.84 MeV and a target consisting of 100 \u00b5g\/cm2 natural\ncalcium on a 1 mg\/cm2 silver backing. Hasper et al. [8] also used the (d,\u03b1) reaction but\nwith a deuteron energy (4.421 MeV) and a target composition (320 \u00b5g\/cm2 natural calcium\non a 1 mg\/cm2 nickel backing) very similar to the current work. Engmann et al. [9] used the\n39K(3He,\u03b1)38K reaction with a beam energy of 9.0 MeV and a target consisting of 700 \u00b5g\/cm2\nnatural KBr evaporated onto a 500 \u00b5g\/cm2 gold foil. Hence it is only the F(\u03c4) values of\nHasper and Smith [8] with which a meaningful comparison can be made and, in general,\nthe values measured in the current work are in agreement with those of Hasper and Smith.\n7\n\u22121 \u22120.5 0 0.5\ncos \u03b8\n1929\n1933\n1937\n1941\n1945\n1949\nE\n\u03b3(k\neV\n)\nFIG. 5: The measured energy of the 1944 keV transition from the 2404 keV state as a function of\ncos\u03b8. The straight line corresponds to the best fit.\nDespite this, the lifetimes extracted in the current work are on average \u223c 25% larger than\nthose of Hasper and Smith [8] who used nuclear and electronic stopping-power theories of\nLindhard et al. [24] and Blaugrund\u2019s approximation of the scattering angle [25]. Analysis of\nthese stopping powers [21] has shown that they are \u223c 50% larger than the values calculated\nby SRIM [13] in the energy region of interest, thus giving a shorter lifetime for essentially\nthe same F(\u03c4) value. The final column of Table III lists the weighted average values of\nthe lifetimes. Using the value of 80\u00b113 fs for the lifetime of the 2404 keV state and the\nbranching ratios listed in Table I, a matrix element of 8.7\u00b10.9 for the 2+T=1\u2192 0\n+\nT=1 transition\nis obtained.\nIV. DISCUSSION.\nShell model calculations for 38K were done using the Antoine shell model code [26] with\nthe CWH [27], USD [28] and IOKIN.SDPF.SI35 [29] interactions. Figure 6 shows the com-\nparison between the empirical positive-parity levels below 2.5 MeV and the results of these\ncalculations. The CWH and USD interactions only include the N(Z)=8 to 20 shell and\ntherefore calculations for 38K (N=Z=19) have a restricted space when these interactions are\nused. The IOKIN.SDPF.SI35 interaction has been developed to describe nuclei with N>20\n8\nsuch as 38Cl and 40,41K [29] and, in addition to levels in the N(Z)=8 to 20 shell, includes\nthe f7\/2, p3\/2, f5\/2 and p1\/2 orbits. In the current work this valence space was truncated to\nallow excitation from the sd shell only into the f7\/2 orbit. The rightmost 3 columns in the\nfigure show the result of allowing 0,2 and 4 particles respectively across the A = 40 shell\ngap. Identical results could be obtained by allowing 1,3 or 5 particles across the shell gap\nindicating that the particles prefer to move in pairs. The reduced \u03c72 (defined as\n\u2211N\ni=1(E\nexp\ni -\nEthi )\n2\/(1000\u00b7 N) between the experimental levels and the theoretical calculations is given\nat the top of the figure for each interaction. The best agreement with the experimental\nvalues is achieved by the configuration which allowed a maximum of 2 excitations from the\nsd shell to the 1f7\/2 orbit. It might be expected that better results would be obtained as the\nnumber of allowed excitations increases. The fact that this is not observed could be because\nthe IOKIN.SDPF.SI35 interaction was optimised to describe the neutron-rich nuclei around\nN=28 [29].\n3 0.0\n0 458.4\n2 2438.6\n1 685.3\n1 1712.4\n3 0.0\n0 118.2\n1 457.5\n1 1585.7\n2 2323.9\n1 398.8\n1 1557.5\n2 2280.9\n3 0 15.33 0.0\n0 130.3\n1 459.4\n1 1698.3\n2 2403.7\n3 0.0\n0 310.5\n1 634.7\n2 2323.7\n3 0.0\n1 276.1\n0 484.5\n2 2510.3\n1 1853.9\n1 1720.8\nExperiment\noccupation= 0 occupation= 2 occupation= 4\nIOKIN.SDPF.SI35CWH USD\n2\n= 11.5 14.0 32.0 3.8 10.4\nFIG. 6: Positive-parity levels below 2.5 MeV in 38K compared with the results of shell-model\ncalculations (see text for details).\nFigure 7 shows the matrix elements for the A=38 triplet compared with the results of\nshell-model calculations using the USD interaction (left) and the IOKIN.SDPF.SI35 inter-\n9\naction allowing 2 particles across the A=40 shell gap (right). The calculations used en = 0.5\nand ep = 1.5 but have been normalised in each case to the empirical value for\n38Ar. Although\nFigure 6 indicated that the best agreement for the level energies could be obtained with the\nIOKIN.SDPF.SI35 interaction and allowing 2 particles across the A=40 shell gap, Figure 7\nshows that there is little difference in the predictions in terms of matrix elements and in-\ndeed the calculated Mp values are almost identical for all five situations shown in Figure 6.\nThis indicates that the structure of the T=1 states is not affected strongly by the different\ninteractions. None of the calculations is able to explain the value of the matrix element for\n38Ca which is \u223c150% larger than predicted.\nThe value for 38Ar is obtained from a measurement by Speidel et al. [3] using the Doppler\nShift Attenuation Method following the 12C(34S,8Be)38Ar reaction at a beam energy of\n67 MeV. The value of B(E2:0+g.s.\u21922\n+\n1 ) which they measure (122\u00b13 e\n2fm4) is compared with\na value of 171 e2fm4, calculated [3] using full sd shell model calculations with the WBT\ninteraction [30] and effective charges of en = 0.5 and ep = 1.5. Indeed, both the value for\n38Ar and the one for 38K are in agreement with the results of calulations [31] using the\nChung and Wildenthal interaction [32].\nThe value for 38Ca is obtained from a measurement of B(E2:0+g.s.\u21922\n+\n1 ) = 96\u00b121 e\n2fm4\nvia intermediate energy Coulomb excitation of a beam of radioactive 38Ca [4]. This value\nequates to B(E2:2+1\u21920\n+\ng.s.) = 19.2\u00b14.2 e\n2fm4 and an Mp value of 10\u00b11 efm\n2. It is, however,\nof note that, in ref. [4], the authors comment that the B(E2) value to the second excited 2+\nstate is of the same order of magnitude to that observed to the first. This is unexpected due\nto the different nature of the two 2+ states (the second of which is a member of a deformed\nband built on the 3.057 MeV 0+ state) but is interpreted as implying modest mixing between\nthe 3.057 MeV 0+ state and the ground state. It could be that instead the mixing is between\nthe two 2+ states thus affecting the value of the matrix element measured for the 2+T=1\u2192\n0+T=1 transition. However this seems an unlikely solution given that the energy of the 2\n+\nstate shown in Figure 1 is not much shifted from where the systematics suggest it should be\nand indeed, it would not explain why the observed B(E2) value is larger than that expected\nfrom systematics or from the results of shell-model calculations.\n10\n1-1 0\nT\nz\n0\n5\n10\n15\nM\np(e\n(fm\n)2 )\n-1 0 1\nT\nz\nFIG. 7: Comparison between the empirical matrix elements for the 2+T=1\u2192 0\n+\nT=1 transition for the\nA=38 isobaric triplet and the results of shell model calculations using left: the USD interaction\nand right: the IOKIN.SDPF.SI35 interaction and allowing 2 particles across the A=40 shell gap.\nThe error bar for the Tz=1 data point (\n38Ar) is smaller than the symbol.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe lifetimes of 5 excited states in 38K have been measured using the DSAM technique\nfollowing the (d,\u03b1) reaction. The values measured are in general agreement with previous\nwork [7\u20139]. This is particularly important for the 2404 keV Jpi = 2+ state since a recent\nmeasurement [4] in 38Ca suggested that the previous value for the matrix element for the\n2+T=1\u2192 0\n+\nT=1 transition in\n38K did not fit with the systematics of the T=1, A=38 nuclei. This\nre-measurement confirms the value for 38K which is in agreement with both the systematics\nand the results of shell-model calculations using a range of interactions and model spaces.\nThis measurement therefore adds to the intrigue of understanding the structure of the Jpi =\n2+T=1 states in the A=38 nuclei.\nAcknowledgements\nThe visitors to the WNSL would like to thank the technical and academic staff for their\nassistance and hospitality.
