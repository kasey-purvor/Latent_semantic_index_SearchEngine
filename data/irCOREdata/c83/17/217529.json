This article discusses a study of the contextual advantages and disadvantages experienced by primary schools in the south east of England, concentrating especially on schools in the least deprived 5% of schools nationally. The research highlights the central influence of advantaged socioeconomic contexts on day-to-day school processes and on the related perspectives and beliefs of head teachers as well as variations on this theme related to other external and internal contextual variables. It illustrates that England's most socially advantaged primary schools are likely to have much in common including a high level of parent involvement, a strong focus on student learning and progress, considerable ability to raise funds, very good reputations and only a handful of students with serious learning or behavioural problems. They also have in common middle class forms of transience and profiles of special needs. The article concludes that while contextual variations amongst socially advantaged schools do exist and are talked up by head teachers, they usually have an impact that can be managed. \u00a9 2011 Taylor & Francis","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"Taylor and Francis","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n    \n    \n      oai:eprints.lse.ac.uk:32306<\/identifier><datestamp>\n      2011-05-04T16:20:08Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n      74797065733D43454E54524553:4C53455F52435F3830<\/setSpec><\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:relation>\n    \n      \n        http:\/\/eprints.lse.ac.uk\/32306\/<\/dc:relation><dc:title>\n        Variations on a middle class theme<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\n        Thrupp, Martin<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Lupton, Ruth<\/dc:creator><dc:subject>\n        HN Social history and conditions.
