The paper recommends various ways of overcoming the problems that arise\nfrom the three developments.\nIntroduction\nThe argument in this paper is based on the view that, even though traditional classroom\nteaching and lecturing are likely to remain the norm, there is a recognized and growing\nplace for the use of technology in educational provision in schools and universities. Online\ncourse design is still very much open to discussion, since traditions of delivery have yet to\ndevelop. But new software developments are arriving so quickly, that educators have barely\ntime to experiment with one mode of delivery before they are overtaken by another.\nThere are three issues that are, or shortly will be, crucial to online education:\n\u2022 the new literacy required by group discussion in writing - 'e-talk', and developments in\nvoice-recognition technology as well as automatic translation;\n\u2022 a second new literacy arising from the merging of multimedia with text, heralding new\nhybrid artefacts of communication, which, moreover, the reader has the power to alter;\n69\nAnita Pincas New literacies and future educational culture\n\u2022 the increasing ease of information retrieval, mainly keyword searches of the Web and\ncitation indices, both of which are steadily contributing to the erosion of boundaries\nnot only between traditional disciplines, but between published and informal discourse.\nOne issue that must urgently be addressed is how to determine our priorities in order to\nhelp educators, as well as the disenfranchised, the unemployed and the alienated. Should\nwe make efforts to improve the cheapest, simplest and until now most reliable of text-based\ninternational communications, namely email, or should we rather turn our attention to the\npotentials of the most exciting new multimedia on the Web with its attendant new literacy\ndemands.\nAlthough the above three developments are at first sight apparently unrelated, they are\nvery likely to blend and thus evolve further new paradigms of literacy, knowledge and\neducation. The problem has of course been recognized in outline for some time, for\ninstance by Meyrowitz (1985), who described how the new kinds of place created by\ntelevision and computers led to a separation of social from physical place, a blurring both\nof public and private behaviours and of adulthood and childhood, the merging of genders,\nand the appearance of new group identities. Although he acknowledged that there were\nlimitations as well as new freedoms in the electronic age, he maintained that, on the whole,\nto be liberated from the traditions of space-determined encounters and print-controlled\ninformation was a healthy development. He foresaw how traditional expertise based on the\n'one-thing-at-a-time, one-thing-after-another and take-time-to-think' world of reading\n(p. 326) might give way to more valuable types of thinking which involve both the 'integra-\ntion of multiple variables and overlapping lines of simultaneous actions' as in video-games\n(p. 326) and the breaking of discipline boundaries because of universal equal access to data\nfrom all fields via television and computer searches (p. 327).\nToday, such changes are even more clearly foreseeable. But an endorsement of the value of\ntechnology does not imply an uncritical acceptance of it. Recent arguments (Noble 1997,\nHammonds, Jackson, George, and Morris, 1997) have highlighted the perhaps unfortunate\nrole of business-driven initiatives in some US universities. It is crucial for us to clarify our\nown educational priorities, especially by looking ahead. In this context each of the three\nnew developments will be discussed in turn and some possible effects on the culture of\neducation predicted. The interrelationship between all three will be suggested.\nE-talk\nOver the last few years, email has become established in the academic and the general\ncommunity, while Web-based communication systems are moving towards a seamless\ninterface between Web information and interaction among people. Online discussion is a\nnew genre, which I have elsewhere called 'e-talk' - electronic conversations in writing\n(Pincas, 1999). It has features different from both spoken and written language (Yates,\n1993; 1995) and it presents users with unaccustomed problems.\nThe rapid emergence of voice-text systems (Hershman, 1997) will to some extent change\nthe situation again, first, by bypassing the keyboard, and second, by shifting the user's\nlanguage from the written mode to the spoken, even though the receiver might still elect to\nread a text version rather than listen to speech. Both of these factors will contribute to the\nfaster development of educational delivery by computer-mediated communication (CMC).\n70\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 2\nFor the moment, however, problems of conversation in writing are paramount. They\nspring from the apparent formless nature of CMC discussions, as perceived by\ninexperienced users, and also from the stark absence of expected paralinguistic effects. This\nsection will propose ways of lessening the difficulties, and will deal briefly with cross-\ncultural effects on communication.\nIt is necessary to recognize the division between two ways of using the Internet (which can\nstill be divided roughly into email and the Web), namely open or closed. Open email is\nexemplified by chat lines (informal synchronous computer-mediated conversations in\nwriting), MOOs and MUDs (slightly more structured synchronous computer-mediated\nconversations in writing, with attempts to create imaginary, virtual rooms and other\nspaces), and list-server discussions that anyone can join. In any of these environments,\npeople do not normally know each other in any concrete reality but nevertheless\ncommunicate about a range of topics including their own lives and emotions. Closed email\nis exemplified by private communications and online discussions deliberately initiated for a\nfixed, specified and controlled group of people who may or may not know each other in\nthe 'real' face-to-face world, but who at least can locate each other by the co-ordinates of\nthat 'real' world, i.e. a name, an occupation, a phone number, a partial address, etc.\nThe distinction between open and closed email is not absolute, since there are varying\ndegrees of each, e.g. a chatline, MOO or list-server designed for members of a certain\nprofession or followers of a certain hobby, is partly closed, whereas a discussion conference\nfor a group of students on a course may admit non-registered students as guests who are\nnot known to the student group. The Web may likewise be open when Web pages offer\nunrestricted access to anyone, but are closed in differing degrees as registration or routing\nthrough a moderator are required.\nStructuring online discussion\nThe open vs. closed contrast is crucial for any educational initiative that attempts to\nfunction partly or wholly online. Open contexts are essentially unstructured and\nuncontrolled. It is well attested in CMC literature (Archee, 1993; Coombes, 1993;\nShedletsky, 1993) that insufficiently structured open-ended discussions online are more\ndifficult than in ordinary speech contexts where time limitations restrict participation and\ninstant feedback can limit digressions. Online conversations are characterized by multiple\nthreads of content, proceeding fugue-like over elongated time periods, and by the ability of\nall members to take part without being interrupted. Early studies of CMC in education\nfrequently reported on these features, calling them overload or, more recently, 'infoglut'\n(Harasim, Hiltz, Teles and Turoff, 1997, p. 222). In a context that values student-student-\ntutor dialogue as an element of the learning process, where, therefore, language is central\nto collaborative learning (Laurillard, 1993), an open situation can indeed lead to\noverwhelming chaos.\nTo overcome this difficulty, an online teacher has to take effective steps to close and frame\nthe education in general and online conversations in particular. One way of doing this is to\nfragment topics so that discussion will remain relevant. Another way is to regulate online\nconversations, making sure that students know very precisely what is required of them. Yet\nanother solution is development of appropriate discourse conventions for group\ncommunication between remote interlocutors. Whether assisted by voice-text mechanisms\n71\nAnita Pincas New literacies and future educational culture\nor not, the conventions that will suit the new context need to be different from those of\nordinary conversation. In the present culture of education where courses are being\nmarketed globally, strangers learning together in CMC courses are breaking into new uses\nof language and forging new norms of interaction.\nHowever, the best main advice present is to close and structure any online discussion. After\nall, ordinary conversation is manageable because of learned conventions, principally those\nof turn-taking. These conventions are severely altered by what is possible in CMC. The\nadvice that follows will briefly outline communication problems in CMC, relying on a\nclassification provided by Poyatos (1983) of turn-taking behaviours when interlocutors are\neither facing each other or hearing each others' voices (henceforth referred to as FV). A\n'turn' is an occasion for speaking.\nThe discussion in this section assumes currently available CMC technology. Looking\nfurther ahead, text with linked or incorporated visual and sound elements may overcome\nsome of the difficulties discussed and we may see the birth of yet another kind of discourse\nwhere CMC conversation will share features of real-life encounters. As in early, uncon-\nsidered, uses of CMC, we will at first see an open use of them. Later, it will be understood\nthat conventions of framing and regulation need to be imposed, otherwise the chaos of\nfree-for-all activity will have its negative effect.\nInitial turns\nAn initial turn in FV may be claimed by physical movement, e.g. pulling up a chair,\nstanding up, taking another's arm, throat clearing, eye contact etc., or by a verbal\nmove such as saying 'Well . . .' It may be granted by a listener as an offering, e.g. when a\nlistener indicates willingness by smiling, pointing, leaning back, or using words such as 'Go\nahead'.\nCMC involves a quite radical contrast: anyone is able to send a message at any time, but\nnorms of behaviour can be established within a certain group, just as they are in many FV\ncontexts such as committee meetings. For example, the tutor could nominate someone\nto start a discussion. However, even if such a proposal is made, any other student could\nnone the less take the first turn, saying, for instance, 'Before John Doe starts the ball\nrolling, could I just ask . . .', and might thereby pre-empt totally what the tutor had\nwanted. A tutor or moderator in CMC might have the power to delete another's\ncontribution, but could probably not prevent some members of the group from having\nalready seen it.\nMany topics may be initiated by different members of the group, and the result can very\nquickly become a complex web of criss-crossing initiations and responses which even the\nparticipants find difficult to negotiate, and may very soon abandon. The lesson for\nmoderators of CMC educational interactions is to be aware of the consequences of\nfostering open discussions without pre-defined turn-taking roles.\nTurn changes\nTurn changes in FV are initiated by the listener, as a bid to take the floor, and may be very\nsimilar to initial turns. The speaker has then the option of yielding the floor. The listener\nmay have preceded his attempt to take the floor by pre-opening moves such as signals such\nas 'Er . . . ' or physical movement, etc.\n72\nAn-J Volume 8 Number 2\nIn CMC, it is not a question of listener-bid and speaker-yielding, but, rather, it is at least\ntheoretically possible that every member of the group in a free-flowing discussion will\nrespond, and then that every member will respond to every response! In practice, of course,\none might make an informed guess that one-fifth of the group will respond each time,\nbecause the asynchronicity guarantees that at least some readers will see early responses to\nthe opening turn and will not feel any need to add to the discussion themselves. None the\nless, even a small progression of successive responses can quickly become a very large\nnumber of messages. In addition, the CMC listener has an opportunity to respond more\nfully than the FV listener and may therefore steer the discussion into a new direction, thus\ntaking over from the speaker, who may then be at pains to bring it back to the line he\nstarted.\nIn other words, any CMC response could function as the opening of a new thread of\ndiscussion, since no one can 'hold' the floor. Whereas there is a variety of further FV turn-\nchange behaviours, e.g. speaker nomination of the next speaker, or speaker overruling a\nlistener's attempt to take the floor, the standard case in CMC is that the speaker always\nloses the floor once the message has been sent. It is indeed questionable to what extent\nthere is indeed a floor to be held in CMC. It would have to be established by some kind of,\nprobably prior, common agreement. For instance, students might know that they should\nalways defer to the instructor. Or, again, they might feel that one of their own number has\nhigher status or greater knowledge, and therefore should be shown deference. Such\ndeference might be signalled variously, e.g. in relative brevity of responses to the speaker's\nmessage(s), or in overt encouragement to the speaker to continue ('I would like to hear\nyour views on . . .'), or in covert admission of the speaker's dominance ('I found your\nmessage... very interesting John. Thank you').\nMore importantly, because of the prevalence of multiple strands of discussidn, the floor in\nCMC has to be defined in terms of threads of messages and their content. A sequence of\nmessages can be called a thread if there is evidence that the senders intend them to relate to\neach other and they do relate in content. Current software and user inexperience still make\nthis problematic, however. A listener may reply to a speaker using the software's reply\nfunction, indicating his or her intention to continue a thread. However many respondents\ncarelessly use the reply function merely to communicate with the sender about something\nelse, often without bothering to change the subject header.\nNone the less, even in closed CMC discussion, there is normally a number of floors, or\nthreads. In other words the unique contribution of CMC to educational discourse is the\nopportunity for a group of participants to run several sub-discussions at the same 'time', in\neach of which there might be different speakers holding the floor and different patterns of\nturn-taking. As has been indicated earlier, the larger the volume of such discussions, the\nmore difficult it becomes to follow, even for those most intimately involved in it, again\narguing strongly for a good structure within which overload is less likely to occur.\nSequences of turns\nIt is evident that sequences of turns have a unique character in CMC. There are adjacency\npairs as in FV ('I think X' - 'So do I', or 'Will you come?' - 'Yes, OK') but they may not\nappear next to each other in the CMC list of messages. It has been suggested that CMC\nusers compensate for the lack of FV discourse management strategies by an increased use\n73\nAnita Pincas New literacies and future educational culture\nof openers in order to achieve interaction, e.g. questions, suggestions, requests and an\nincreased use of expressions like 'I'm sending you this message because . . .', 'You can\ndecide...', 'What do you think?' (Condon and Cech, 1996).\nListener feedback\nA particular problem in CMC is listener behaviour generally. In FV, listener feedback is\nlikely to involve a whole family of behaviours, e.g. attention signals, such as silence, verbal\nitems like 'Oh' or 'Yes', kinesic indication such as leaning forward, adjusting the facial\nexpression, etc. But CMC users often wonder if anyone is listening to them (i.e. reading\ntheir messages). They often follow a message with another one asking 'Have you read my\nmessage of . . . ? ' or 'Does anyone agree or disagree with what I wrote on . . .? ' or even 'No\none has responded to my message of . . . Is there something wrong?' In time, they develop\ngroup behaviours to overcome this, but only within a properly framed discourse structure.\nIn FV there is also considerable interlistener behaviour, with or without the speaker\nnoticing, to express their reactions, or compete or prompt each other to take the next turn.\nThis in principle is possible in CMC, e.g. by private email, but less effective since it takes\nvery much longer than in FV.\nFortunately, language users are flexible and creative and therefore adapt their practices to\nthe needs of new contexts, whether CMC or any other social context. Educators should\nhelp the process by defining roles, making conventions explicit, and generally raising\nawareness. Even such an apparently minor matter as whether it is acceptable to simplify\ntyped text by abbreviations of words and short syntactic constructions needs to be made\nclear (Condon and Cech, 1996).\nCultural aspects of online discussion\nThe discussion has assumed that CMC writers were English speakers. But a totally\ndifferent kind of CMC literacy problem is developing as universities add more overseas\nstudents to their lists; they are discovering cross-cultural issues that are compounded in\nCMC because English is either a foreign language or a second language in use in countries\nlike India, Singapore or Kenya, where local uses have led to new versions of it (Kachru,\n1983). Overseas students will have their own attitudes to ways of using different genres\nwith different topics, different notions of what is or is not appropriate to say and in what\nform of speech, and even different uses of silence.\nIt is a partial benefit that some cultural differences are not very apparent online. Accents,\nbehaviour, race, religion and the other elements that make up cultural diversity are filtered\nout by the graphic text and have a levelling effect on status (Davis and Brewer, 1997). On\nthe other hand, users may be quite unaware of misunderstandings and problems that\nindividuals face, unless they are overtly mentioned. Again, explicit consciousness-raising\ncould be a solution.\nFor the English-speaking world the norms of discourse have been encapsulated by one of\nthe most cited writers within linguistics (Grice, 1975), who put forward the maxims of the\nCo-operative Principle:\n\u2022 Make your contribution as informative as required; do not make your contribution\nmore informative than required.\n74\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 2\n\u2022 Make your contribution relevant.\n\u2022 Do not say what you believe to be false; do not say that for which you lack adequate\nevidence.\n\u2022 Be perspicuous, and specifically: avoid obscurity, avoid ambiguity, be brief; be orderly.\nIt does not take very much consideration to see that all the terms of Grice's maxims are\nhighly culturally loaded. How much information is sufficient? What is relevant? What is\nclear and what is obscure? What counts as true?\nEnglish speakers are well-known to express their frustration with speakers of other\nlanguages who 'won't get to the point', who persist in spending time on 'irrelevant' matters,\nwho are far from clear and who may not be adhering to the truth. To some extent there are\nmore dangers of misunderstanding in CMC than in FV interactions. Problematic as cross-\ncultural meetings may be, at least the interlocutors can see each other, look polite, make\nconciliatory gestures, rapidly adjust the drift of talk, correct a bad impression on the spot,\nand so on. All of these manoeuvres are difficult if not impossible in CMC but may be\npartially overcome by multimedia developments.\nThe chief aspect in which cross-cultural misunderstandings are likely to persist is in\nrelation to relevance. At the opening of a recent CMC master's course of mine where\ntwenty-six English teachers were giving brief word-pictures of themselves, their interests\nand their work, the content that attracted most discussion was the word 'asshole' used by\none of them, which some others considered taboo. A reasonable hypothesis is that\nlanguage teachers would perceive a language issue as more relevant to their discussion than\ncommon interests like sport, which took a very secondary place. On another online course\ncontaining people from a range of subject areas, some (non-English) participants felt their\ncontributions had been unfairly or even insultingly ignored. But it could be argued that\nwhat they had considered relevant was not perceived as such by the others. The\nphenomenon called 'flaming' - strong emotion expressed online in ways that would not be\ntolerated in FV - is likely to be at least partly due to such misunderstandings (Wang, 1996).\nIt may be pessimistic to assume that cultural differences and confusions are ineradicable, but at\nthe very least, educators must be aware of, and make attempts to, safeguard against their worst\neffects. Again, careful framing of both topics and discussions is likely to be the best policy.\nMultimedia artefacts\nPrint has been usurped by digital technology, so that it now incorporates multimedia and\nhypertext capabilities that have allowed the creation of new computer artefacts that have\nno generic name as yet, but which combine text, still and moving pictures, speech and\nmusical sounds, in a fluid kaleidoscope of hyperlinked parts (Warschauer, 1999). In\naddition, the very fact that these artefacts are digitally stored, means that any user can\nboth 'read' them in any order and alter them at will (Lanham, 1992). The combination of\nthese features means we have something very unlike a book - a 'combook', where 'com'\nrefers both to 'combination' and 'computer' (Pincas, 1998).\nIn fact the nature of literacy is altered. Words, a set of tokens that readers are compelled to\ninterpret through their own thought processes, are now side by side with concrete\n75\nAnita Pincas New literacies and future educational culture\nrealizations of meanings through icons and sounds. Iconic communication has been\ndenigrated as 'comic book culture' (Lanham 1992). But there is another way of seeing it,\nnamely as a new semiotic. Thus, icons, as much as words, need to be interpreted in the light\nof the context, the perceived goals of the originator, the cultural values within which these\nare set, and so forth. This is equally true of a moving image, of sounds and of music.\nIcons of all kinds have the potential to function just like words, i.e. as mere tokens of\nwhatever interpretations users wish to put upon them. They lead further and further into a\nnew semiotic which will incorporate not only the old rhetorical traditions, but also visual\nand sound arts, and thus we are facing what Lanham calls a new organization of\nhumanistic knowledge. It is beyond the scope of this paper to describe how knowledge is\naltered by the multimedia process, but that it is altered seems beyond doubt. My own faith\nis that it will enlarge our cognition, not confine it as Lanham suggests: 'Nothing less than\nhuman reason itself stands at risk' (Lanham 1992). More optimistic approaches are\nadvocated by Kress and van Leeuwen (1996), Hill (1996), and Bolter (1991), among many.\nNone the less, the fact that combooks are digital and have hypertext introduces a funda-\nmentally different process into literacy. The reader is no longer constrained by linear print\nto a 'fixed basic cognitive scale' and compelled to 'follow the argument on the level of\ngenerality the author has chosen to employ. With the new medium, the scale at which\nconceptual thought is pursued now becomes a user-selectable parameter' (Lanham 1992).\nIn other words, the fact that the combook is on a computer not only permits the viewer-\nreader to counterpoint sections in ways that the author may not have intended or foreseen,\nbut further, to amend, rewrite, reformat, set in another typeface, change colours, all with a\nfew keystrokes. Thus, the whole system of cultural authority enshrined in the book\nevaporates, literally, at a stroke. The fixity of print no longer operates and the 'reader' has\nturned into a potential author.\nThese two developments - multimedia and reader power - are most likely to have positive\nconsequences for education, at least for a liberal cultural context. Access to combooks will\nbecome easier both cognitively and in cost, and they will be attractive to young learners\nbecause of the seamless interface with game software. Reasoning, judgement, logic,\nevaluation, will all be brought to bear on combooks. Whereas film or television, in their\nrigid form, possibly debased thought, a digital cluster of options can liberate it.\nNothing in this section should be taken to imply the demise of the traditional book. It is\nunlikely that the convenience of scanning and flipping pages of paper will be overtaken by\neven the smallest, most powerful, laptop. Although it is convenient for learners to have a\nwhole study pack all together in one place, either in one book (or set of manuals), or on\none CD-ROM disk or on a Web-page hyperlinked to other pages, it is well-known that\nstudents print out the contents of disks and Web pages. Perhaps we will see a 'combination\ncombook', an integration of a paper book and a small laptop.\nThe erosion of information boundaries\nIn traditional writing it is a laborious process to cite other writers, even with established\nconventions. It is even more laborious, or indeed impossible, to cite conversations, lectures,\ntelevision programmes, films, or any of the many aspects of our lives that we, personally,\ndo not have a record of. But that will shortly change in a radical way. For instance, it is\n76\nALT-} Volume 8 Number 2\nalready possible for an email message to include a video clip. As distance education moves\nforward, and lectures are sent by video to students, and also as online discussions increase,\nall of these 'talked' texts will be available to be searched, copied, and cited.\nUsers are thereby liberated from the rigidity of print. Moreover, on the Internet, two\nfurther processes are occurring. These are the development of information retrieval\nfacilities: (a) collecting items by keywords rather than by discipline boundaries, and\n(b) tracking citations within citations in published works, thus sweeping across information\nstores.\nBecause of both, conventional disciplines are melting into each other. The main difference\nbetween a keyword search and a citation search is that the former is dependent on\nknowledge of the field's vocabulary and on good formulation of the keyword(s), while the\nlatter uses the expert authors themselves to lead to related literature through their own\nbibliographies and the further bibliographies contained in these, ad infmitum.\nAlthough both the Social Sciences Citations Index and the Institute for Scientific\nInformation index can be accessed via a Web browser, they are not yet able to scan the Web\nor read books. When they do, they will be able to add to their data of authored prose\nanything that is made available to the Web, such as sound and text conversations\n(synchronous chat and asynchronous email conferences) and all the elements of\ncombooks.\nConsiderable adjustments will have to be made. We will soon have to give up our notions of\nbeing purveyors of prepackaged, finite, subjects-to-be-learned. And there are interacting\nprocesses here: as soon as users perceive the lack of boundaries, they behave differently.\nBut that does not mean that education will become a free-for-all chaos. It does mean that\nwe will have to tailor our courses so that they are seen as entry-points to wider exploration.\nOf course, 'good' education has always been somewhat like this, but it has become less\npossible for teachers and students alike to ignore the vast new potential.\nConclusion\nNowadays, the fear of added burdens is already well known among those who approach\nonline education with a frightening vision of having to be ever at their computer screens.\nWe can find gloomy pictures of 'an inevitable extension of working time and an\nintensification of work as faculty struggle at all hours of the day and night to stay on top\nof the technology and respond, via chat rooms, virtual office hours, and email, to both\nstudents and administrators to whom they have now become instantly and continuously\naccessible' (Noble, 1997).\nMany teachers feel overwhelmed by the pressure to learn the new delivery modes \u2014 email,\nvideo-conferencing, the Internet. They fear not only that their own technical and academic\ncompetence may come into question, but that they will be deluged by constant availability\nto their students and a need to monitor information on the Internet in regular, exhausting\nways.\nThis is not necessarily true. Taken together, the porosity of knowledge domains and the\nfluidity of combooks suggest that learners will collaborate not only with each other and\ntheir teachers, but within the very media they are exposed to. Transmission of knowledge is\n77\nAnita Pincas New literacies and future educational culture\nnow tempered by a far higher degree of interaction between receiver and transmitter.\nTherefore the apparent burden on educators could be seen as decreased by the auto-\nnomous learning power of the individual and the increased opportunities for collaborative\nlearning among students. This illuminates common remarks about the 'liberating' effect of\nthe Internet.\nA possible scenario, therefore, is that we shall see a regeneration of creativity as learners\nforge their own combooks, constructing a pastiche of conventional text with saved\nhyperlinked multimedia elements and citations retrieved from many divers sources. Ideas\nwill, in principle at least, be preserved and reusable - truly recombinant knowledge.\nReferences\nArchee, R.
