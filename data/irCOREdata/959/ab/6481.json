ISBN: 0-7494-3025-7. Paperback,\n147 pages, \u00a39.99.\nNowadays, in this current era of the Web,\nsearching the Internet is probably as important\n(if not more so) as using conventional libraries\nand the facilities that they contain in order to\nlocate sources of sought-after information.\nIndeed, the Internet (as an information resource)\nis now so important that virtually all students\n(both in schools and colleges) are given some\nexposure to it at some stage during their\neducation. Because of its importance, there is a\n'veritable multitude' of books on searching the\nInternet. For me, this book is a particularly\nattractive one because of its low cost, its scope\nand coverage and, most importantly, the style in\nwhich it is written.\nThe author has organized the eleven chapters\ncontained in this book into two basic types:\nskills and focus. The seven 'skills chapters'\n(namely, 1 to 6 and 11) are intended to provide\nhelpful information on how to find things on the\nInternet. The four 'focus chapters' (7 to 10) are\nthen used to offer help with specific information\ntopics such as quick reference, locating people,\nexpertise, archives, and so on. Throughout the\nbook the author employs four different types of\ndisplay box (these are labelled Zoom In, Try It,\nSample Sites and Miner's Tales) in order to\nprovide useful additional, sometimes anecdotal,\nmaterial to accompany (and amplify) that\ncontained in the main textual narrative. At the\n80\nend of the book there is a useful appendix\nentitled 'Getting onto the Internet'. This\ndiscusses connection techniques (modems,\nISDN, and so on) and the type of software that\nis needed in order to use the Internet.\nBecause of their introductory nature, the first\nthree chapters of the book are aimed at\nnewcomers to the Internet and the Web. These\nchapters describe what the Internet is (and is\nnot), how and when to use it (using a Web\nbrowser, ftp and Telnet) and some of its\nimportant attractions and limitations. The real\nsubstance of the book commences in Chapter 4\n(entitled 'Search Engines and Indexes'). This\nchapter discusses the basic ideas underlying\nWeb-based information retrieval using, both\nportals and specific search tools. As well as\noutlining techniques for improving the quality of\na search, the author describes many of the\npitfalls to be wary of. Chapter 5 ('Agents and\nFerrets') discusses meta-searching and various\ntools to support this activity (such as DogPile,\nMetaCrawler and Ask Jeeves) while Chapter 6\n('Information from People') homes in to the use\nof electronic mail, newsgroups, conferences and\nonline chatting for gleaning information from\nother people. The final 'skills chapter' (Chapter\n11 - 'Getting Launched') acts as a sort of 'super\nrecap' which pulls together the various key\naspects of the material that was presented in\nprevious parts of the book.\nThe 'focus chapters' commence at Chapter 7. The\nfirst of these - 'Quick Reference and News' -\ndescribes the Web as the world's 'largest\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 2\nencyclopaedia' and then goes on to discuss how to\nobtain reference information from various\nsources such as electronic books, virtual news-\npapers, e-magazines ('e-mags') and broadcasters'\nsites (containing TV and radio listings). For some\nreason, even though e-mags are described, the use\nof electronic journals is not considered - either in\nthis section of the book or in the later part that\ndeals with education. In the following chapter the\nauthor focuses his attention on finding people (by\nlooking for contact details such as email\naddresses), locating places (by using online maps)\nand obtaining details of organizations (primarily,\nbusinesses and educational establishments). The\nfocus of Chapter 9 is on locating and using Web-\nbased expertise and archives. This chapter\ncontains a useful section on 'digital libraries' as\nsources of multimedia information such as\nphotographs (and other forms of static image),\nsound files and video clips. The section concludes\nwith a cautionary reminder about the complexity\nof copyright law with respect to Web-based\nresources. Chapter 10 (entitled 'Buy, Buy, Buy') is\nthe final focus chapter. Here the author discusses\nelectronic commerce - that is, buying and selling\non the Web. Some of the important issues\ndiscussed in this chapter include: techniques for\nlocating items of interest (for purchase); security\nissues relating to using credit cards with a Web\nbrowser, buying software packages from the Net;\nand, of course, virus protection.\nOverall, this is a very useful book, which I\ncommend very highly. However, I do have some\nminor reservations about the limited depth to\nwhich some of the topics are covered. Indeed, I\nbelieve that many readers, having been through\nthis book, would probably want to graduate on to\na more advanced treatment of Web searching -\nthat could build on the basic introductory\nmaterial that Clegg's book presents. Therefore, for\nanyone who might want to seek out some 'follow\nup' reading on Internet searching, I would\nstrongly recommend the 'Web search engines'\nbook by Randolph Hock. Hock's text would be a\nvery useful supplement to this book as it goes into\nthe underlying mechanisms of search engines in\nconsiderable depth. Details of Hock's book can\nbe found at http:llwvnv.onstrat.com.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nDanny Saunders and Jackie Severn (eds.), The\nInternational Simulation and Gaming Research\nYearbook, Volume 7: Simulations and Games for\nStrategy and Policy Planning, London: Kogan\nPage, London, 1999. Hardback, ISBN: 0-7494-\n2956-9, xiii+284 pages, \u00a335.00.\nThis is the latest in a series of yearbooks\nsupported by SAGSET, the Society for Inter-\nactive Learning. SAGSET is a professional\norganization, which aims to develop the use of\ngames and simulations in education and train-\ning.\nThe editors' introduction provides essential\ninformation on a variety of definitions for the\nterms 'simulations' and 'games' and an overview\nof the book's contents. This book contains six\nsections with twenty-five articles called chapters.\nEach chapter has accompanying biographical\ninformation and either references or recom-\nmendations for further reading.\nSection 1 deals with theory and strategy; it\nconsists of five chapters, the first of which looks\nspecifically at strategic planning in higher\neducation. The use of simulations to deal with\nreal-life scenarios is dealt with in a simple\nstraightforward manner. The second chapter\nlooks at the use of games and simulations in\neducation, training and research whilst provid-\ning a theoretical model and framework for a\ntaxonomy on gaming. It covers a breadth of\ninformation and places the use of games and\nsimulations into a structured framework.\nChapter 3 focuses on a case study to link the\ntheory and practice of simulation, whilst\nChapter 4 uses the case study to develop hypo-\ntheses regarding the contribution that gaming\nand simulation can offer in a research context.\nChapters 3 and 4 use examples from educational\nsettings to provide believable, practical articles.\nThe final chapter in this section, in contrast to\nthe first four, looks at an interactive procedure\nused by the gaming machine industry called HI-\nLO. The results of a survey on the probability of\nwinning using either a rational or irrational play\nstrategy are given.\nSection 2 looks at business and commerce within\nfive chapters, numbered six to ten. Chapter 6 is\nconcerned with student expectations of a\ncomputer-simulated business exercise in the\nservice management industry. It is easy to read,\nusing real-life case study examples. It looks at\nthe realism of the simulation exercise and how\nstudents made use of their past theoretical\nknowledge. Chapter 7 provides an evaluation of\n81\nReviews\na specific expert system to assist in high-level\nstrategic decision-making. The expert system is\nthoroughly reviewed through the development of\na prototype and feedback received from students\nusing it. Chapter 8 focuses on the design and\nauthoring of two CD-ROMs for business educa-\ntion. It considers the needs of the learners and\nthe appropriate context mix required, and then\nstates the experiences of the author in its\nimplementation. Chapter 9 outlines a game\ndesigned for the licensed trade industry. It\ndescribes how the system was developed and its\npractical uses. A list of the type of team\ndecisions available and past participants'\nresponses are given. Chapter 10 outlines the use\nof an activity called a 'war game'. This\nmechanism is used to pre-test a product prior to\nits launch to assess the potential effects that the\nproduct or service will have in the market place.\nStudents, working in groups, undertook a range\nof roles and became involved in the 'war' either\nto attack or to defend the company. Specific case\nstudies are illustrated and evaluated in terms of\nthe game's usefulness as a learning activity.\nSection 3 looks at communication and culture,\nsubdivided into three chapters numbered eleven\nto thirteen. Chapter 11 outlines a game that\nattempts to cross language barriers. During the\ngame players cannot use known languages as the\ngame emphasizes communication issues to create\na neutral language platform. An outline of the\ngame's philosophy, direction and development\nprovides intensely interesting food for thought.\nChapter 12 looks at the teaching of psychology\nusing the Internet, not as an information store,\nbut as a tool for developing critical questioning\nand discussion skills. It concludes that the\nInternet is a valuable tool for student reflection as\nit encourages discussion. Chapter 13 provides\ninstructions for a card game and an insight into\nthe benefits that may be achieved by playing it.\nThe setting is politics but the game could be used\neffectively in other situations. The chapters in this\nsection form an extremely important part of the\nyearbook as they describe and analyse real games\nand simulations in context.\nSection 4, covering Chapters 14 to 18, looks at\nmanagement and group processes. Chapter 14\ndescribes the rationale and the results of the use\nof a game within a large organization wishing to\neffect change. Chapter 15 provides a critical\nevaluation of how simulations can be used by\nthe business community to consider organiza-\ntional change and effectiveness strategies. In\nChapters 16 and 17 simulations are used to assist\n82\nin problem-solving and decision-making situa-\ntions. Both chapters highlight the use of a\nproject management plan to facilitate group\nproblem-solving activities in organizations.\nChapter 18 examines how different role-play\nexperiences can be de-briefed. It uses particular\ntheories and practices taken from a theatre arts\nbackground.\nSection 5 covers Chapters 19 to 23 and looks at\nthe areas of science, engineering and technology.\nThese chapters describe the application of games\nand simulations within specific environments.\nChapter 19 looks at a business environment using\ncase studies to enable the acquisition of skills and\nknowledge to improve communication, numeracy\nand learning how to learn. Chapter 20 uses\nsimulations within a nursing context where sim-\nulations are a safe and effective training vehicle.\nChapter 21 outlines the use of games and simula-\ntions for management decision-making in a\nmicrocomputer-based information system to\nsupport teaching and team-building in an\ninteractive scenario. The TV show 'Countdown' is\nthe main focus for Chapter 22 where, using\nartificial intelligence, a mental arithmetic game is\nmodelled. In Chapter 23 two approaches to\naddress the need for a changing curriculum,\nwhere usable professional and social skills are\nrequired for graduate construction managers, are \u2022\noutlined. These approaches involved integrating\nsimulations into project work and introducing\nproblem-based learning techniques.\nThe final section of the book provides yearbook\ninformation in two chapters. The first details\nrelevant recent articles and the second provides\ncontact addresses and sources for further in-\nformation.\nThis yearbook provides a breadth of informa-\ntion on games and simulations. It will appeal to\nthose currently researching this area and to\norganizations wishing to use effective learning\ntools. Educational researchers and lecturers will\nfind much of interest in this easy to read and\npractical handbook.\nAnne M. Brown, Heriot-Watt University\nTim Russell, Effective Feedback Skills, Second\nEdition, London: Kogan Page, 1998. ISBN 0-\n7494-2569-5. Paperback, 155 pages, \u00a316.99.\nAssessment remains one of the least researched\nareas of further and higher education practice.\nAssessment might be seen to have a number of\nfunctions, for example to:\nALT-] Volume 8 Number 2\n\u2022 provide evidence of academic quality at a\nrange of levels;\n\u2022 provide data to support judgements about an\nindividuals academic attainment or vocational\ncompetence;\n\u2022 support learners understand and apply\nrelevant academic or vocational standards,\nknowledge or competence;\n\u2022 establish a context for, and evidence to\nsupport, meaningful feedback to encourage\nsubsequent learning.\nFeedback from tutors, peers and through mech-\nanisms of self-review and reflection are essential\nif effective learning is to facilitated. This view of\nthe importance of feedback is explicit in Tim\nRussell's informative and practice-orientated\nbook: 'Feedback is an essential skill for learning\nknowledge and skills and there are many\ndifferent circumstances when feedback will be\ngiven within a training and teaching context' (p.\n33).\nThis quote also offers a concise insight into the\nspecific orientation and focus of the text. The\nbook itself is part of the Kogan Page 'Practical\nTrainer Series' and offers a practical review of\n'feedback' as something the 'trainer' provides to\nthe 'trainee'. As such, it is an essentially uni-\ndirectional process designed to support the\nacquisition of competence: 'Probably the single\nmost important skill for any trainer is being able\nto give feedback to trainees on their perform-\nance. Unless trainees can find out what they are\ndoing right, they will not know how to do it\nagain. Unless they can find out what they are\ndoing wrong, they will see no need to change.\nUnless they are shown the correct way to\noperate, they will not know how to change... If\nwe give too much of the wrong sort of feedback,\nwe can sour the relationship between trainee and\ntrainer, if not the whole concept of training for\nlife'(p. 10).\nWithin this context the book offers a number of\nshort chapters focusing on aspects of feedback\nand debriefing, a more problematic concept for\nRussell and intriguingly employed in 'areas of\ntraining where there is no right or wrong', the\npurpose of debriefing being 'to explore options\nrather than confirm any particular course of\naction' (p. 11). Specifically the book explores:\n\u2022 issues and terms, with a particular focus on\nhow people can and do learn and on defining\nthe 'feedback' and 'debriefing';\n\u2022 summary analysis based on experience of the\ncontexts for feedback, how to give feedback,\nhow people might receive such feedback, and\nhow feedback might be turned into a\ndebriefing;\n\u2022 summary analysis of the contexts for and the\nmeans of delivering a debriefing session;\n\u2022 and finally, practical advice on reporting back.\nAll of this is presented in 153 pages of text,\nchecklists for trainers, figures and illustrative\ntraining documentation.\nThe one-side summary on page 154 repeats and\nreinforces the focus and rationale for the text.\nSpecifically, that feedback 'is probably the most\nimportant of all trainer skills... the content of\nthe message might affect the rest of a person's\nlife'.\nThe list of suggestions for further reading\nidentifies a number of the better-known texts in\nthe field but lacks a contemporary feel, the most\nrecent text identified being another from the\nKogan Page stable published in 1993.\nThere is much of value in this book. It explains\nits subject matter with commendable clarity and\nis clearly based on extensive practical training\nexperience. It is focused, practical and concise.\nThere are clearly complexities within learning\nand assessment on which the author is silent.\nThe uniqueness of, and the idiosyncrasies\ntypified by, any individual leaning interaction\ntend in the writing to be subsumed into the\nestablished wisdom of training practice. Feed-\nback, for Russell, is either 'right' or 'wrong' - no\npost-modern ambiguities here! Certainly, the\nreader seeking a more critical and learner-\nfocused exploration of the topic will need to\nlook elsewhere. However, those readers who are\nseeking a short, introductory text designed to\n'train the trainer' could do far worse than start\nwith Tim Russell's readable guide.\nPeter Funnell, Suffolk College\nGraham Chapman (ed.), Computer-Based Learn-\ning in Science - Proceedings of the CBLIS 99\nInternational Conference, University of Ostrava,\nCzech Republic, 1999. ISBN: 80-7042-144-4.\nHardback, 600 pages, \u00a320.00.\nComputer-Based Learning (CBL) is by no\nmeans a new topic, however, its scope and\ncomplexity have ensured the subject remains at\nthe forefront of academic discussion. It is\nexpected, therefore, that this extensive edited\n83\nReviews\nwork, comprising 63 fully refereed conference\npapers, will be of interest to many within the\nsciences. Contributors are drawn from fifteen\nnations and although the majority are from the\nCzech Republic and central Europe, there are a\nnumber from as far afield as China, Australia,\nUSA and Canada. Thus, the volume's contents\ncan be considered as a reasonably wide\nrepresentation of academic research and opinion\nin the field of CBL. The papers were presented\nat the fourth international conference for\nComputer-Based Learning in Science, CBLIS\n'99, held at the University of Twente, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands. Focusing on 'developments in\ncomputer technology to assist learning in\nscience', the articles within this publication cover\nmany aspects of this subject. Reflecting this,\nComputer-Based Learning in Science is divided\ninto a general section and eight topical sections,\nnamely teaching and learning, intelligent\nsoftware, teaching packages, simulation pack-\nages, virtual reality and laboratory in science\nteaching, multimedia techniques, distance learn-\ning, and evaluation and monitoring of perform-\nance.\n\"The computer promises my students an endless\nsupply of information, but what good will that\ndo if they can't make sense of any of it?\nTechnology promises to help my students\nexpress their ideas better, but what good is that if\nthey don't have any ideas to express?' (Lowell\nMonke). This quote is given by Jana\nKapounova, in An Approach to Information\nEducation of Teachers. This and the paper by\nPeter J. Wright are the two that perhaps best set\nthe scene and reflect the title of this book. In\ntotal there are four articles that discuss\nbackground issues contained within the initial,\ngeneral section, which also contains two more\nspecifically directed papers.\nThe teaching and learning chapter contains eight\npapers. Those more general in nature discuss the\nintegration of CBL within the Polish education\nsystem, the practical adaptation of traditional\ncourseware into Web-based instruction to afford\nmultifunction teaching in China and the\ndevelopment of automatic auditing within viable\nlearning systems. The more directed papers\nreport on the implementation of specific CBL\nexamples, including problem-solving, databases\nand computer knowledge. These tend to focus\nrather more on the practical aspects of teaching\nthan on the evaluation of use and outcome. A\nfurther three papers can be found in the related\nintelligent software section.\n84\nIndicative of the ever-growing influence of CBL\nis the chapter on teaching packages that contains\n16 papers. Not only are many nationalities\nrepresented, but so too are many fields. Topics\nare indeed wide-ranging, covering, for example,\ngeometry, soil mechanics, stock price fore-\ncasting, biology and digital photogrammetry.\nSome packages discussed are now in educational\nuse, while others are still in the developmental\nstage. The reports vary in scope from those that\nare purely descriptive regarding the nature of\nimplementation of a particular package, to\nspecific case studies providing examples of use\nand those reporting on usability and evaluations\nof learning. Findings by and large, suggest\nstudents responded favourably to the introduc-\ntion and use of these packages, especially for\nthose that offered students active engagement\nwithin simulations and models. In addition,\nthere were some indications that learning could\nbe enhanced, albeit where measurement was in\nterms of pass rates and times to complete for\nshort questions. However, such extraneous\neffects as motivation levels and increased study\ntime were not eliminated from the results.\nFour simulation packages are next described.\nEach focus on the construction of interactive\napplications with a high degree of 'real-world'\ntopical relevance, for example air pollutant\ndispersion, optics and logistics. In a similar vein\nthe following section describes four case studies\nusing virtual reality or virtual laboratories.\nThe chapter on multimedia techniques features\nseven articles. Wide-ranging in nature, they discuss\nboth background issues and individual case\nstudies. The use of the Web for material delivery\nand assessment is reviewed and the design implica-\ntions of large file sizes, common in multimedia,\nare considered. Case studies report on the use of\ncomputer graphics, transferral of a ToolBook\ndevelopment to the Web, computer-based\ninstruction in Matlab, the integration of subject-\nspecific features within a general framework and a\ntool for implementing object- orientated models.\nAs well as a general review of information tech-\nnology in social sciences, the distance-learning\nsection includes papers on the development of\ndesign frameworks for situational and\/or\nnetworked learning, the use of CBL for seminar\npreparation, a database course and an evalua-\ntion of teamwork and video-conferencing within\ntwo international projects.\nThe final chapter contains seven papers regarding\nevaluation and performance monitoring. Most\nALT-] Volume 8 Number 2\nstudies used questionnaires to obtain student\nfeedback; however, a few provided evaluations\nbased upon increases in learning as determined by\npre and post test results. Perhaps of most interest\nto lecturers are the findings relating to\ncomparisons between computer and paper-based\nmaterials. Gosper and Love reported higher\nresponse levels for online questionnaires, but\ncontent was not the same as that for the paper\nversion. Learning using the ESP programme\nversus paper-based instruction was reported by\nOliver and Oliphant A slight advantage\n(statistical significance not given) was recorded\nfor ESP. Educational content was deemed the\nsame; however, details regarding such aspects as\ncourse structure and integrated questions and\nanswer sections were not provided.\nAny publication aiming to provide com-\nprehensive coverage of computer-based learning\nrequires consideration of, and reflection on, not\nonly the computer\/technological tools used to\nfacilitate learning, but also the cognitive pro-\ncesses of learning. That this work does not\nneglect the latter creates a rather more balanced\nview of this topic than is frequently achieved\nthrough conference compilations. Aspects that\ndetract to some extent from the overall presenta-\ntion, are the lack of consistency in text format-\nting and style of referencing, the rather low print\nquality for many of the figures and some\nobserved difficulties in translation. The sixty-\nthree papers not only suggest a variety of ways\nin which computer-based learning can be used\neffectively, but also highlight areas of develop-\nmental overlap and indicate many future\ndirections and enhancements to teaching and\nlearning. The proceedings comprise a mixture of\nbackground or topic review papers, evaluation\nstudies, empirical research reports and instruct-\nive reports; consequently the strength of theoret-\nical underpinning varies considerably from\npaper to paper. Notwithstanding this diversity,\nthere is much to interest the computers-in-teach-\ning enthusiast and much to encourage those still\nnot totally convinced of the benefits of using\ncomputer technology in science teaching.\nKate Garland, University of Bristol\nLeslie Rae, Using Evaluation in Training and\nDevelopment, London: Kogan Page, 1999. ISBN:\n0-7494-2805-8. Paperback, xi+243 pages, \u00a319.99.\nLeslie Rae's latest handbook aims to provide\neverything a trainer needs to evaluate training,\nfrom the design of the evaluation process to the\nuse of particular types of test. In typically\nreadable fashion, Rae produces practical\nguidelines for the busy professional which\nquietly broaden perspectives and challenge\nassumptions. His style is succinct and his text\nliberally interspersed with boxed lists, diagrams\nand summaries.\nRae's main concern is to bring a more\nconsidered and professional approach to\nevaluation, which he believes is one of the least\npractised subjects in training. Despite the\npotential cost and time of his proposals, he\nregards evaluation as essential to demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of training and the amount\ninvested in it. His audience are the trainers and\nmanagers he believes have a stake in evaluation.\nHe also caters for those working towards\nInvestors in People or Training and Develop-\nment NVQs. In an era of accountability, any-\nbody preparing and presenting data about\ntraining should find Using Evaluation in\nTraining and Development a valuable source of\nideas and evidence.\nThe book offers a range of practical ways for\nembedding evaluation in the training cycle. Rae's\nfocus is broad and the frameworks he presents\nbuild on the work of influential authors like\nKirkpatrick, Honey and Newby. He considers\nevaluative measures that take place before,\nduring and after training, including long-term\nfollow-up. He offers guidelines and practical\nresources for the wide range of people\nresponsible for the success of the training\nprocess. He deals with direct training, self-\ninstruction, open, distance and programmed\nlearning. Although he is not concerned with the\nevaluation of education programmes, many of\nthe techniques Rae outlines are adaptable for\neducation or training.\nThe opening chapters discuss the place and\nfunction of evaluation and rehearse familiar\nreasons for its neglect. These range from an over-\nreliance on end of course 'happiness sheets', to a\nfailure of stakeholders to take responsibility for\ntheir role. To address this, Rae underlines the\nneed actively to involve key players in all stages\nof the cycle. Line managers, for instance, should\nhelp establish learning outcomes and play more\npart in briefing learners before and after\nprogrammes.\nChapters 4, 5 and 6 are some of the most\ninteresting in the book. They begin by intro-\nducing non-specialists to current approaches to\ntesting. Rae outlines a variety of techniques\n85\nReviews\nincluding the use of likert and Thurstone scales\nin multiple-choice tests. Complementary methods\nof assessing knowledge and application are\nexplored. His insights often strike a chord. His\nadvice against using experts to set practical tests\nwill be familiar to those who have tried to elicit\nknowledge from experts who suggest short cuts\nwhich do not correspond to complete and agreed\npractice. Once or twice his touch deserts him -\nexperienced educators may cringe, for instance, at\nthe advice to avoid using notice boards to publish\nleague tables of test results.\nHe regains his poise as he considers tools for\nobserving interpersonal behaviour in groups. By\ndevoting almost a chapter to Behaviour Analysis,\nhe introduces tools for the quantitative and\nqualitative profiling of individual activity in\ngroups. He covers simple contribution scoring,\ndirectional sociograms and reflective, self-report-\ning techniques. He handles the area well and,\nthough he avoids being drawn into conceptual\ndebate, his approach to group interaction is lively\nand provides useful background for those keen to\nresearch it. It is a chapter to return to.\nChapters 7,8 and 9 cover evaluations which take\nplace during and after training programmes. I\nenjoyed reading about thermometers, speedo-\nmeters and progressive blob reviews. The limita-\ntions of end-of-course reactionnaires which fail\nto illuminate the extent of learning or its transfer\nto the workplace are underlined well. The\nchapter on Interim Evaluations contains the\nsensible advice to avoid undertaking them unless\nyou are prepared to address the issues they raise.\nIt also presents some thoughtful variations on\nlearning logs.\nEducational developers will probably find the\nchapter on evaluating open and distance\nlearning disappointing. It runs to just ten pages\nand focuses on instructional packages. Although\nthe absence of frameworks for evaluating\nnetworked learning or the quality of dialogues\nfor iterative design is understandable, it is\nperhaps surprising that Rae's earlier interest in\ngroup dynamics does not prompt him to look at\nasynchronous, collaborative work. The short\nsection on media-based learning offers less to the\nlearning technologist than the dedicated tools we\nnow have available through LTDI and TLTP.\nEven at ten years old, the reliable MEDA\nmaterials offer a richer framework for evaluating\neducational software.\nDespite this, like most of Leslie Rae's books.\nUsing Evaluation in Training and Development is\n86\nvery readable. It offers those new to training a\nframework for evaluation and experienced\ntrainers practical solutions, using tested re-\nsources. It supplies staff or educational develop-\ners with materials that can supplement\nincreasingly specialized resources. It provides a\nsound evidence base for those putting together\nportfolios for accreditation. Its great strength is\nto suggest ways of evaluating staff development\ninterventions more strategically by involving a\nwider number of stake-holders. In a busy world,\nincluding all members of Rae's Training Quintet\n(learner, trainer, line manager, training manager\nand senior manager) may be unrealistic but, for\norganizations with the time, he provides the\ntools to do so.\nUsing Evaluation in Training and Development\nis a useful addition to the trainer's bookshelf.\nPaul Haslam, King Alfred's, Winchester\nAlistair Inglis, Peter Ling and Vera Joosten,\nDelivering Digitally: Managing the Transition to\nthe Knowledge Media, London: Kogan Page,\n1999.

Hardback, xiv+210\npages, \u00a335-00.\nDelivering Digitally 'is designed for those with\nresponsibilities for managing the transition from\ntraditional approaches to education and training\n- whether face to face or at a distance - to forms\nof digital delivery. This includes everyone from\nthe chief executive officers of educational and\ntraining organisations to heads of departments,\ncourse co-ordinators and technical and\neducational specialists' (p. xii). The book is\ndivided into four sections: 'Context', 'Imple-\nmentation', 'Quality Assurance' and \"The\nFuture'. Each of these sections is intended to\nstand on it own; and, indeed, most of the book's\nthirteen chapters are reasonably self-contained\nand each provides valuable insights into manag-\ning this process of change.\nIn an industry that is changing as rapidly as that\nof digital educational media, it is not surprising\nthat the first section of the book, 'Context', is\nnot its strongest section. None the less the initial\nthree chapters do contain some useful material.\nIn these chapters the authors seek to context-\nualize the issues and provide a foundation upon\nwhich policy can be built. In the first chapter,\n\"The Origins of the Knowledge Media', they set\nforth a definition of digital media that is perhaps\na little too computer-centric. The phrase 'know-\nledge media' was coined by Marc Eisenstadt at\nALT-] Volume 8 Number 2\nthe UK's Open University (p. xiii). They, like\nEisentstadt, use it to refer to Web and CD-ROM\nbased material. Given the convergence of digital\nbroadcasting with Web and other computer-\nbased media, this perhaps needlessly narrows the\nbook's perspective, but doesn't detract too much\nfrom its central focus on managing the process\nof change.\nAs the title suggests, the second chapter, 'Social\nForces Driving Educational Change', examines\nthe role of the university in modern society and\nconsiders how that role has evolved from\nCardinal Newman's rather elitist view in the nine-\nteenthth century to the more populist, market-\ndriven model of the present The chapter also\ncontains a series of useful tables that set forth a\nseries of premises and policy implications with\nrespect to managing the change to digital media.\nIndeed, one of the book's greatest strengths is the\ninclusion of a range of tables, flow diagrams,\nchecklists, and so on, that can serve as valuable\nmodels to inform decision- making.\nThe final chapter in the opening section,\n'Learning in an Electronic Environment',\nunsurprisingly, offers a fairly 'constructivist'\nview of education and considers what an ideal\nvirtual learning environment (VLE) should be\nlike. Significantly and, to this reviewer's mind,\nrightly, they argue that a VLE should include a\nfull range of teaching, learning and administrat-\nive functions. They list these as: 'enrolment\/\nregistration of students; provision of course\nadvice; provision of course materials; provision\nof feedback; provision of responses to\nadministrative and academic queries; conduct of\nassessment; [and] provision of assessment\nresults' (p. 37). This list alone should suggest to\nmanagers just how great is the scale of change\nimplicit in the digital delivery of higher\neducation.\nThe second section, 'Implementation' is by the\nfar the largest. Its eight chapters occupy more\nthan half the book and in their titles provide a\nreasonably comprehensive list of the issues\nfacing management in this period of change. The\nfirst two chapters, 'Counting the Cost' and 'A\nCost or an Investment?' make a number of\nvaluable points about the cost implications of\ndigital delivery. By no means the least important\nof these points are that managers need to be\ncareful to count the hidden costs as well as the\nmore obvious ones and that the case for\n'economies of scale' is by no means transparent.\nHowever, the most important point in these two\nchapters is that financial management in higher\neducation needs to become more adept at\nrecognizing when an expenditure is a 'cost' and\nwhen it is an 'investment'. The expense involved\nin migrating to digital delivery is as much an\ninvestment in the future of higher education as is\nthe creation and maintenance of the building\nstock; and will similarly require continuous\nmaintenance in the future.\nThe next four chapters, 'Re-engineering\nTechnological Infrastructure', 'Reskilling and\nSupporting Staff', 'Reorienting the Teaching\nProgramme' and 'Redesigning Learner Support\nServices', address in detail some of the more\nobvious things that need to be considered. The\nfirst emphasizes the importance of establish-\ning clear and manageable targets for the re-\nimplementation of the technical infrastructure.\nFor example, it is pointless adopting a VLE,\nhowever good, that cannot run over key systems.\nThe crucial issues of staff development and\nsupport are addressed in the next of these\nchapters. Digital delivery is novel and staff will\nneed to be trained to exploit it; and, even when\ntrained, they will require new levels of support.\nStill further this staff development process might\nbe described as a 'bootstrapping' one. As the\nauthors put it, 'You can't recruit experience in\ntomorrow's technology' (p. 85).\nThe next of these four chapters addresses the\nissue of how far institutions should engage in\ncourseware development and provides some\nuseful guidance about how to choose material\nthat is not created in-house. Although this is a\nvery useful chapter in many ways, it should\nperhaps be noted that it takes little account of\nthe good work in this area that has been done in\nthe UK in recent years. However, it does make\none very important point that harks back to the\nissue mentioned in the last paragraph. This is to\ndo with the corporate memory. Not only are\nuniversities going to need to create the experi-\nence and expertise to exploit digital delivery,\nthey are also going to need to find ways of\nkeeping that expertise within the university\ncommunity. The last of these four chapters\nconsiders the wider impact that digital delivery\nwill have on learners and on those, from\nlibrarians to student counsellors, who provide\nthem with supportive services. The impact on\nthese services is easily overlooked, but by no\nmeans any less important.\nThe last two chapters of this section as well as\nthe single chapter in Section 3, 'Quality\n87\nReviews\nAssurance', address the issues of evaluation,\nchange management and quality control. Both\n'Developing an Evaluation Strategy' and\n'Managing the Transition' provide a range of\nchecklists and other instruments that can be\nused by managers (and others) to measure how\neffective the process has been and how far an\ninstitution has progressed along the path from\ntraditional to digital modes of delivery. The\nthird of these chapters looks at how one\nmaintains standards during this process and\noffers, as the title suggests, 'A quality assurance\nframework for achieving best practice in new\nlearning technologies'.\nThe single chapter in the final section,\n'Anticipating Tomorrow's Innovations', is, like\nthe opening chapter and for much the same\nreasons, a little disappointing. However, this\ndoes not take away from the book's real\nstrengths. 'Delivering Digitally' provides an\ninsightful overview of the managerial issues\ninvolved in meeting the challenges of the digital\nage; and, still more importantly, it provides a\nrange of practical instruments to support\nmanagers engaged in meeting those challenges.\nBruce Ingraham, University of Teesside\nA. H. Miller, B. W. Imrie and K. Cox, Student\nAssessment in Higher Education - A Handbook\nfor Assessing Performance, London: Kogan Page,\n1998. ISBN: 0-7494-2797-3. Paperback, 288\npages, \u00a319.99.\nAssessment is such a ubiquitous concept. It is\nhelpful to know that this book only addresses\n'student' assessment in 'higher education'. Of\ncourse, if we are to understand what assessment\nis and how it can be used, we really need to\ngeneralize to some extent. Higher education\ndoes have its peculiar attributes. Standards and\nprogression vie with subject mastery and\ntransferable skills. The isolation of 'students',\nwith regard to assessment, is illusory. Higher\neducation is a complex community where\nteachers help learners assess their own and each\nothers' performance, and students provide\nuseful evidence for staff who need to show their\ndeveloping professionalism for accreditation.\nThis applies throughout education. A final\nthought, as a prologue - the book suggests it is a\n'handbook' for assessing 'performance'. I will\ndeliberately ignore the definitive and practical\nnature of a 'handbook' and comment that\n'performance' is probably the most misunder-\nstood concept, apart from 'competence', used in\n88\nhigher education. I still find that the assessment\nof what some call intellectual skills is excluded\nfrom the ambit of 'performance'. Students per-\nform activities, tasks, and even duties - but sel-\ndom is performance attributed to intellectual\nskills. It seems to me from what I hear, that\nsubject knowledge is not 'performed' and is\ntherefore invisible to scrutiny by assessment.\nPerhaps the book will help clarify this point - if\nso, it will serve this reviewer well as I have my\nsuspicions.\nWhat is the book about? The authors, part of\nthe 'Aussie Mafia' who have made such an\nimportant contribution to curriculum design,\nprofessional development and communications\nand information technology (CIT) over the last\ntwo decades, are well known for their writing in\ninnovation, curriculum matters and student\nlearning. The aim of the book is to provide an\nauthoritative reference to relevant assessment\nliterature. It is also for those reflective teachers\nwho are dissatisfied with their current practices.\nMaybe it is part of the reading list for a 'fast\ntrack* to Institute of Learning and Teaching\naccreditation.\nThe book falls into three parts - a broad brush\npedagogic background; a more practical 'How it\nis done' section that includes a good chapter on\ntheses; and an 'issues' section that even includes\nmatter such as ethics and plagiarism (see below).\nSo the cloth is broad - but, is it well-cut? The\nbest way to test this is twofold. First, ask a\nquestion and see if the book provides an answer\nthat is authoritative, useful and that generates\nreflection in the reader. Second, allow the\nauthors to offer something that the reader did\nnot know he\/ she did not know they did not\nknow! In other words a proactive question and a\nreflective response. The question first: 'Do\nexaminations hinder student learning?' If one is\nto be honest, this is not a question that is often\nheard in common rooms and 'quality assurance'\nvisits. Rather, it is implicit in many of the\ncomments made sotto voce on these occasions.\nOne hears of the efforts that go into making\nsure that grades are as reliable as possible; that\nself-assessment is an 'off the wall idea' - best\nconsigned to the 'soft sciences'; or that the use\nof CIT will revolutionize marking by removing\nthe tyranny of the examination paper and free-\ning up so much precious academic time!\nThe trouble with books is that authors do not\nnecessarily think of answers in the way readers\npose questions. I think the answer to my\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 2\nquestion is there. Chapter 3 offers some guid-\nance. Apart from the usual citations to the\nMarton et al. work along with Entwistle, the\nauthors offer a brief guide to a serialist vs. holist\ndichotomy they infer from Gordon Pask. While\naccurately reporting the essence of this oft cited\ndistinction, they miss the range of approaches to\nlearning that Pask recorded - for example,\n'globetrotting as a pathological' approach. I do\nnot think there is too much mileage in this\nanalysis - in a book on assessment. They need to\nconsider the tasks that bring about the response\nidentified. I don't think the authors suggest that\napproaches or styles are stable - which would be\na fallacy; rather they tell me about a classifica-\ntion related to learning (e.g. Bloom - again!)\nwithout explaining how this is effected by assess-\nment tasks. On the other hand they drew my\nattention to the work of another Australian\nwriter John Bowden. The citation on page 43\nwhich reads 'unfortunately there is a good deal\nof recent evidence to suggest that the quality of\nstudent learning . . . is adversely affected by in-\nappropriate assessment methods' rings a bell! It\nsuggests that the issue is about the 'quality' of\nlearning - as opposed to a fixed or static style,\nand the interaction of this with different\nmethods. As a reader, I will follow up the\nBowden surveys and analysis and I take seri-\nously the advice offered by the authors (p. 45):\n'involving students in discussions of learning\nstyle and learning strategy would provide a\nsound basis for both students' intellectual devel-\nopment and quality assurance of the teaching\nprogram'. So, I am encouraged by the book's\nresponse to my question. I reason that there is\nsome interaction between the methods used in\nassessment ('examinations') and the quality of\nthe learning that occurs. A good start. Now,\nwhat can I learn from the authors and what does\nit mean to me?\nI am going to take the issue of 'academic\n(dis)honesty' (Chapter 15, pp. 241-52). I really\nhad not thought too much about this until the\nauthors stopped me in my tracks and made me\nwonder how I would answer a quality\nassessment style of question ' . . . umm . . . can\nyou tell us . . . umm . . . what procedures you\nhave in place to make sure that the judgement\nyou make of student abilities a re . . . umm.. . in-\ndeed judgement of abilities rather than\njudgements on what the students have found\nout?' We need to consider the ethics and codes of\nconduct and procedures by which those involved\nin assessment come to a valid conclusion on\nperformance. CIT and the ubiquitous Internet -\nwhen it is working! - are forcing us to consider\n'what does an assignment handed in by a student\ntell us about that student's cognitive abilities -\nrather than his\/her abilities to find an appropri-\nate essay and pay for it?' The authors are right to\nidentify the 'qualified trust' (cf. Dealing) that\nneeds to operate between society and institutions\nwith regard to student abilities. I take away from\nthe book an idea and some useful citations plus\na nice twist on the interesting idea 'copy from\none, it's plagiarism; copy from two, it's research'\n(citing Wilson Mizner (1876 -1933)). I judge the\nbook to be useful and stimulating. It gave me\nanswers to questions I posed and it offers ideas I\nhad not thought about. So, this is a book to be\nrecommended.\nThinking of assessment, I would offer Kogan\nPage some advice on the Index. Too short with\ninsufficient cross-indexing - a beta minus on my\npersonal utility scale!\nAs a final question - I wonder what criteria the\nauthors set themselves in order that they could\nevaluate the success of this book? Any self-\nassessment question is at the heart of effective\nlearning and assessment. If students are unable to\nknow the criteria that are being used in order to\nmake a judgement or if teachers are not explicit in\nwhat they value - so that students know what is\nvalued - we have a system that will not develop or\nimprove. Self-assessment must be one of the\nunder valued issues in higher education and what\nis now called personal development.\nNow, where in the book did the authors make\nreference to this issue.. .umm .. .?\nRay McAleese, Heriott Watt University\nDavid Lowe and Wendy Hall, Hypermedia and\nthe Web - An Engineering Approach, Chichester:\nJohn Wiley & Sons, 1999. ISBN: 0-471-98312-8.\nPaperback, xxiv+597 pages, \u00a327.50.\nHypermedia authoring software such as\nToolBook, Director or FrontPage, can appear all\ntoo easy to use. The temptation to design and\ndevelop, using a visual interface, at the computer\nmonitor, can prove too strong for many. This\nbook emphasizes the need for a systematic\napproach to development, particularly of large-\nscale hypermedia. It suggests that there is a crisis\nin the development of hypermedia, which - like\nthe 'software crisis' identified in 1968 - requires\nthe formulation of 'engineering' approaches.\nConcepts from software engineering are brought\n89\nReviews\ntogether with several abstract reference models\nspecifically for hypermedia. Three sections deal\nin turn with hypermedia Fundamentals, Practice\nand Research.\nHypermedia development is assumed to be so\ndistinct from software development that software\nengineering is referred to analogously, as some-\nthing that, serendipitously, may hold lessons for\nthe 'emerging discipline' of \"hypermedia engineer-\ning'. While the requirements of hypermedia\ninformation models are acknowledged to be\n'similar' to those of general application develop-\nment, hypermedia is apparently different enough\nto spark off its own 'hypermedia crisis', and to\nnecessitate the new discipline of hypermedia\nengineering. A substantial amount of the material\ncovered, however, reflects standard software\ndevelopment, and aspires towards software engin-\neering qualities and characteristics of main-\ntainability, modularity, adaptability, portability\nand abstraction.\nThe combination of visually driven development\nenvironments, often inherently irregular and\nexploratory structures, and disparate and\ndynamic media types, would certainly appear to\nrequire new and different approaches. The earlier\nchapters contain some illuminating taxonomies\nand nuanced definitions in relation to hyper-\nmedia. And the most cogent parts of the book -\nmainly, but not exclusively, located in the\nsubstantial Research section - are those that set\nout design methods and reference models that are\nspecific to hypermedia. The overview of several\nkey reference models is both representative and\nclearly summarized, as is the Relationship\nManagement Methodology (which adapts entity-\nrelationship design from software engineering,\nand does not necessarily lend itself to educa-\ntional hypermedia). Among others, the Dexter\nreference model and the Amsterdam model are\ncovered, along with valuable insights from the\nauthors' own Microcosm and Matilda.projects.\nEach of these research development chapters\nadopts the same structure, following up the\nproduct and process issues identified in the pre-\nceding section. This helps to sharpen the focus on\nthese issues, and allows the reader to compare\nand synthesize the different approaches. The\nmaterial presented constitutes a useful theoretical\nresource, particularly given the rapidly expanding\nrole of hypermedia in the form of the Web and of\ncomputer-based learning.\nRigorous models and methods are necessitated\nby the size of projects. In the taxonomy of what\n90\nis large and not large, educational material is\ngenerally considered to be 'large'. As such, ad\nhoc approaches are rejected in favour of abstract\nmodels of node and link structures. Also side-\nlined are less formal constructivist approaches\nthat so often inform the development of inter-\nactive educational material. There is little\nrecognition of a need to 'engineer' correct\nalgorithmic content for user activity and other\nfunctionality within nodes or components. It is\nthe links that are said to give functionality to\nhypermedia, rather than anything inside the\nnodes, which are seen essentially as information\nunits within a browsable document database. An\nindication of how a document-based psychology\nmight constrain expectations of the analytical\nfunctionality of non-textual media, is perhaps\ngiven in the use of image-maps as an example of\nan operation that analyses pictures (rather than\nas a means of interactive presentation). For\neducational material - where the functional and\ninteractive richness of media should ideally take\nparticular precedence over their presentational\nrole - a hierarchical structure, enhanced by 'links\nto a glossary and references', is said to be\nsuitable.\nIn spite of the acknowledged debt to software\nengineering, assumptions are made about the\nprevalence of hacking in software development\nthat appear to overlook thirty years of applied\nmethod: where the 'product model' is based on a\nprogramming language, it is claimed that there is\nno means of visualizing the information struc-\nture; that it would be difficult to maintain; and\nthat it will be coded 'from scratch' by isolated\nindividuals. The implications of hypermedia\nproduction paradigms that combine screen-\ndriven authoring with scripting and program-\nming could be explored. With visual authoring\nsoftware packages, the comments regarding their\ninability to separate information from interface\nimplementation are not strictly applicable to\nMacromedia Director. And while not capable of\nMicrocosm's full decoupling of link information\nfrom data, with a little scripting effort at a high\nlevel - and a program-engineering approach -\nToolBook, for example, can facilitate a sig-\nnificant degree of generic associative and naviga-\ntional linking.\nThe book is, at 600 pages, long. There is a narrat-\nive tendency to ask questions (What is hyper-\nmedia? What is hypermedia engineering? How is\nmaterial to be structured and accessed?) on several\noccasions, and to defer answering them until later.\nIndeed, several important chunks of text are\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 2\nrepeated verbatim at different points. This - and\nthe numerous apostrophe and typo errors - is a\nreflection on the copy-editing rather than the\nauthoring of the book.\nThis book is visionary rather than prescriptive -\npointing in directions rather than giving direc-\ntions. Concerned with large-scale hypermedia\ndevelopment principles in general (rather than\nhypermedia-assisted learning in particular), it\nwill be particularly useful for academics teaching\nhypermedia design; for researchers seeking an\nintroduction to the theory of hypermedia\ndevelopment methodology; and for developers -\nincluding Web developers - who wish to gain a\ntheoretical understanding of high-level develop-\nment issues in order to move towards more\nsystematic methods for the design and develop-\nment of hypermedia.\nPeter McKenna, Liverpool Hope University\nCollege\nBrian Tucker (ed.), Handbook of Technology-\nbased Training, Aldershot: Gower, 1997. ISBN: 0-\n566-07809-0. Hardback, x+437 pages, \u00a375.00.\nThe use of technology in training (and learning)\nis a constantly changing field continuously\naffected by developments in various applicable\nfields of technology. This handbook provides\nboth a description of the history and develop-\nment of technology-based training (TBT) and a\ncompendium of available courses.\nThe handbook consists of two parts. The first of\nthese addresses technology-based training and\nthe second comprises cross-indexed listings of\nTBT courses available.\nThe nine chapters in Part 1 contain a description\nof Tucker's view of technology-based training\nand some real-life examples of its use. The case\nstudies are useful in defining the context and\nmain thrust of the handbook - training staff\nusing self-paced and automated computer-based\ntechniques.\nChapter 1 introduces and defines TBT, Chapter 2\ndiscusses possible organizational benefits of utiliz-\ning TBT, and Chapter 3 comments on the possibil-\nities for implementing TBT. How to use TBT in\ndistance learning, pre-course work, course work,\nand post-course work is outlined in Chapter 4. It is\nnot possible to generalize effectively in relation to\nTBT; indeed almost all applications in this field\nhave their own specialities and require careful\nconsideration with respect to customization of\npre-packaged (generic) solutions.\nGeneric training is covered in Chapter 5, whilst\nChapter 6 addresses bespoke training issues such\nas in-house versus outsourcing. Chapter 7\nprovides guidance for the evaluation of TBT,\nand includes considerations of other factors that\nmay be considered in course appraisal. One way\nto gauge the suitability of TBT solutions may be\nto analyse carefully the requirements, leading to\nthe generation of a requirements specification.\nThis process would benefit markedly from the\ninclusion of factors described in Part 1 of the\nTBT Handbook.\nThe future of training utilizing technology is the\nsubject of Chapter 8, while Chapter 9 sets out\ncase studies from large organizations which have\nimplemented successful TBT programmes. I\nfound the case studies most useful for a number\nof reasons. Firstly, some measure of confidence\nis gained in reading about successful implement-\nations of TBT; and secondly, actual cases serve\nto put the handbook into a real-life perspective.\nBy comparing case studies to a particular need,\nthe reader may be able to access their own needs\nand include relevant factors that may have\notherwise been overlooked.\nPart 1 is, in places, a little thin on the discussion\nof issues, but does provide an excellent overview\nto TBT by listing readily categorized areas that\nmust be considered.\nPart 2 lists some 700 generic courseware titles\nindexed by category, alphabetically, by delivery\nmethod and by supplier. Each course is\nsummarized in a template format, providing\ninformation under the following headings: Title,\nPurpose, Suitable for, Prerequisites, Description,\nDelivery method, Minimum hardware require-\nment, Price and Supplier. This is an excellent\nformat, as it provides a basis for comparing\npossible outcomes from each course.\nAn address is included to allow TBT producers\nto add their courseware to the handbook's\ndatabase for future releases. With the type of\nmaterial contained in this handbook being so\ndependent on currently available courseware, it is\napparent that regular updates will be essential to\nensure its ongoing appeal.\nOverall the book is a good starting point for\nsomeone in the market for pre-packaged TBT\ncourses. By addressing some of the best points,\nand some of the limitations, the handbook\nprepares the reader to evaluate the courseware\ntitles listed in the directory section of the book.\nMost of the commercial packages listed would\n91\nReviews\nappeal to larger organizations, and in some\ncases, they could provide flexible cost-effective\nTBT in broad areas such as management,\ncustomer services, induction training and the\nlike. The reader would at the very least be able to\nascertain the availability of material, and be at a\npoint to commence negotiations with suppliers\nfor courseware to suit their particular needs.\nLindsay Offer, Anglia Polytechnic University\nErratum for Volume 8, Number 1\nWe apologize for not including an appropriate acknowledgement to the publisher of\nActivStats in the paper entitled 'Active learning of statistics: a case study', by Erica Morris\nand Eileen Scanlon, which appeared in Volume 8, Number 1 of this journal.
