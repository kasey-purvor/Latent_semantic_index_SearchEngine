The model has three stages of activity;\n(i) citizens decide on whether to stand for o\u00c6ce, and may incur a small cost\nif they do so; (ii) citizens vote for the candidates who stand, and the win-\nner is elected by plurality rule; (iii) the candidate who is elected implements\nher most preferred policy from a \fxed set of alternatives. Besley and Coate\ncall the subgame perfect equilbria of this three stage game political equilibria\n(PE). Although the citizen-candidate model is a major advance over existing\nmodels, a major problem is that there are typically multiple equilibria at\nthe voting stage, due to plurality rule (Dhillon and Lockwood(2000)). These\nmultiple equilibria at stage (ii) generate multiple equilibria to the game as a\nwhole. Osborne-Slivinski(1996) resolve this problem by assuming that vot-\ners vote sincerely. Sincere voting, however is an arbitrary rule for selecting\nstrategies. In contrast, Besley-Coate (1997) impose the requirement that,\nconditional on any set of candidates, the voting equilibrium must be weakly\nundominated. Not surprisingly, this weak re\fnement at the voting stage still\nleaves many equilibria, some of them not very credible\n1\n.\nIn this paper, we investigate whether imposing a stronger re\fnement on\nthe (Nash) equilibrium at the voting stage, conditional on any set of can-\ndidates, eliminates any PE. Our re\fnement is that voting strategies be it-\neratively weakly undominated. We call PE with this re\fnement imposed at\nthe voting stage iteratively weakly undominated political equilibria (IWUPE).\nOur justi\fcation for this re\fnement is twofold. First, that if it is common\nknowledge than agents will not play weakly dominated strategies, then it is\n\"reasonable\" that rational voters will not play their \"second round\" weakly\ndominated strategies, and so on. Some formal justi\fcation of this is in Ra-\njan(1998). Second, it has been shown by De Sinopoli(2000) that more stan-\n1\nBesley and Coate declare \\for those who would like a clean empirical prediction, our\nmultiple equilibria will raise a sense of dissatisfaction.\"\n2\ndard re\fnements (perfection, properness) do not have much bite in plurality\nvoting games; in particular, requiring subgame-perfection only rules out Nash\nequilibria where Condorcet losers are elected.\nDe Sinopoli and Turrini(1999) initiated this approach to re\fning PE in a\npaper where they present an example with four candidates and one winner\nwhich has multiple equilibria. In their example, requiring voting strategies\nto be iteratively undominated eliminates all but one equilibrium where the\nCondorcet winner wins. This result raises the question of whether iterated\ndeletion of weakly dominated strategies also re\fnes political equilibrium out-\ncomes in the case of one, two, and three candidate equilibria. This paper\nanswers this question, fully and negatively. We show\n2\nthat if there exists a\nPE with fewer than four candidates, and a given set of winner(s), then there\nalso exists a IWUPE with the same candidate set and the same winner(s).\nSo, this paper complements De Sinopoli and Turrini(1999); together, they\nhow that iterated deletion of weakly dominated strategies also re\fnes po-\nlitical equilibrium outcomes only when the number of candidates is at least\nfour.\nWe describe the Besley-Coate model in greater detail in Section 2. Section\n3 then discusses the main results. Section 4 concludes.\n2 The Citizen-Candidate Model of Represen-\ntative Democracy\nBesley-Coate (1997) consider a community of n citizens, who may select a\nrepresentative to implement a policy alternative. Each citizen i 2 N =\nf1; :::; ng has a \fnite action set X\ni\nrepresenting the policy alternatives avail-\nable to him if elected. It is possible that citizens may be of di\u000berent com-\npetencies i.e. X\ni\n6= X\nj\n. If no-one is elected, a default policy x\n0\n2 \\\ni2N\nX\ni\nis selected. Voters have preferences over who represents them, as well the\n2\nWe do not show that every PE is also a IWUPE, but rather that every outcome that\ncan be achieved via a PE can also be achieved via an IWUPE.\n3\nalternatives they choose, so utility functions are de\fned on X \u0002 N [ f0g,\nX = [\ni2N\nX\ni\n; i.e. \u0019\ni\n(x; j) is the utility for i if j is elected and chooses action\nx. If no-one is elected, utilities are \u0019\ni\n(x\n0\n; 0):\nThe political process has three stages. At stage 1, citizens face a binary\ndecision: to stand for election (enter) or not. At stage 2, voting takes place,\nand in stage 3, the elected representatives choose policy. We discuss each\nstage in turn.\nAt the \fnal stage, once elected, a citizen i will therefore choose their own\nmost preferred policy (assumed to be unique):\nx\n\u0003\ni\n= argmax\nx2X\ni\n\u0019\ni\n(x; i)\nSince for every citizen's most preferred point x\n\u0003\ni\n2 X\ni\nis known, the induced\npreferences of citizens over candidates are given by u\ni\n(j) \u0011 \u0019\ni\n(x\n\u0003\ni\n; j); i; j 2\nN: We assume that these induced preferences over candidates are strict: i.e.\nu\ni\n(j) 6= u\ni\n(k); all i; j; k 2 N; j 6= k: Also, u\ni\n(0) \u0011 \u0019\ni\n(x\n0\n; 0):\nAt the second stage, voting is by plurality rule: each voter has one vote,\nwhich she can cast for any one of the set C \u001a N of candidates who stand,\nand the candidate with the greatest number of votes wins. If a set of two or\nmore candidates have the greatest number of votes, every candidate in this\nset is selected with equal probability. Let W \u001a C be the set of candidates\nwith the most votes, which we call the winset. Then voter payo\u000bs over some\nW are:\nu\ni\n(W ) =\n1\n#W\nX\nj2W\nu\ni\n(j); i 2 N\nFormally, let \u000b\ni\n= j if voter i votes for candidate j 2 C:\n3\nThen \u000b =\n(\u000b\n1\n; :::; \u000b\nn\n) denotes a vote pro\fle. Let W (\u000b;C) \u001a C denote the winset,\ngiven the vote pro\fle \u000b and candidate set C. The utility to voter i from \u000b\n(given C) is then u\ni\n(\u000b;C) \u0011 u\ni\n(W (\u000b;C)): A Nash equilibrium pro\fle \u000b\n\u0003\nis\n3\nWe assume there is no abstention. When voting is costless and, as in our version of\nthe Besley-Coate model preferences over candidates are strict, abstention is always weakly\ndominated so that ruling out abstention is without loss of generality.\n4\nde\fned in the usual way as a pro\fle where \u000b\n\u0003\ni\nis a best response to \u000b\n\u0003\n\u0000i\n; all\ni 2 N:\nLet S \u001a C\nn\nbe any set of voting pro\fles, with S = \u0002\ni2N\nS\ni\n. Say that \u000b\ni\nis undominated relative to S if (i) \u000b\ni\n2 S\ni\n; (ii) there does not exist \u000b\n0\ni\n2 S\ni\nsuch that u\ni\n(\u000b\n0\ni\n; \u000b\n\u0000i\n; C) \u0015 u\ni\n(\u000b\ni\n; \u000b\n\u0000i\n; C), all \u000b\n\u0000i\n2 S\n\u0000i\n, and u\ni\n(\u000b\n0\ni\n; \u000b\n\u0000i\n; C) >\nu\ni\n(\u000b\ni\n; \u000b\n\u0000i\n; C), some \u000b\n\u0000i\n2 S\n\u0000i\n: Now de\fne the sequence of sets of vote pro\fles\nfA\n0\n; A\n1\n; A\n2\n:::g for i as follows: A\n0\n= C\nn\n; and A\nn\n= \u0002\ni2N\nA\nn\ni\n; where A\nn\ni\nis the\nset of voting actions for i that are undominated relative to A\nn\u00001\n; all i 2 N: As\nthe set of voting actions is \fnite, A\nn\nconverges after a \fnite number of steps\nto some A\n1\n; which is the set of vote pro\fles that are iteratively weakly\nundominated. It is always non-empty. Also, the A\nn\nare understood to be\nconditional on C:\nBesley and Coate de\fne a voting equilibrium to be a \u000b\n\u0003\nwhich is (i) Nash\nequilibrium; and (ii) weakly undominated i.e. \u000b\n\u0003\n2 A\n1\n: We will focus on\na stronger re\fnement of Nash equilibrium i.e. where \u000b\n\u0003\n2 A\n1\n: Formally, an\niteratively weakly undominated voting equilibrium is a \u000b\n\u0003\nwhich is (i) Nash\nequilibrium; and (ii) iteratively weakly undominated i.e. \u000b\n\u0003\n2 A\n1\n:\nFinally, we turn to the entry stage. Any citizen can run for o\u00c6ce, but if they\nrun, they incur a small cost \u00c6. If no-one runs for o\u00c6ce, the default policy x\n0\nis implemented. In the \frst stage, citizens decide non-cooperatively on their\nentry: \r\ni\n2 f0; 1g denotes the entry\n4\ndecision for i. When deciding upon\ncandidacy, citizens all anticipate\n5\nthe same voting equilibrium \u000b\n\u0003\n(C) among\nthe multiple equilibria at the voting stage, given any possible set of candidates\nC. Denote the strategy pro\fle at the entry stage by \r = f\r\n1\n; :::; \r\nn\ng.\nWe can now state our equilibrium concepts. A weakly undominated political\nequilibrium (WUPE) of this game is a (\r\n\u0003\n; \u000b\n\u0003\n(:)) if (i) \r\n\u0003\nis an equilibrium\nof the entry stage, given \u000b\n\u0003\n(:) and (ii) \u000b(C) 2 C\nn\nis a weakly undominated\nNash equilibrium in the voting subgame, for every C \u001a N .

An iteratively weakly\nundominated political equilibrium (IWUPE) of this game is a (\r\n\u0003\n; \u000b\n\u0003\n(:)) if (i)\n\r\n\u0003\nis an equilibrium of the entry stage, given \u000b\n\u0003\n(:) and (ii) \u000b(C) 2 C\nn\nis an\niteratively weakly undominated Nash equilibrium in the voting subgame, for\nevery C \u001a N .\nIt is helpful for future reference to state the equilibrium entry conditions in\neither case, which are \frst, that i 2 C must prefer to enter, given \u000b\n\u0003\ni.e.\nu\ni\n(\u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n=fig); C\n\u0003\n=fig) \u0014 u\ni\n(\u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n); C\n\u0003\n)\u0000 \u00c6; i 2 C\n\u0003\n(1)\nand second, that any j =2 C must prefer not to enter, given \u000b\n\u0003\ni.e.\nu\nj\n(\u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n[ fkg); C\n\u0003\n[ fkg)\u0000 \u00c6 \u0014 u\nj\n(\u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n); C\n\u0003\n); j =2 C\n\u0003\n(2)\nFinally, we state the assumptions we need (in addition to those made by\nBesley and Coate(1997)) for our analysis. First, we assume a \\no indi\u000berence\nover lotteries\" condition i.e.\nNI. u\ni\n(W ) 6= u\ni\n(W\n0\n); for all i and all W 6= W\n0\n; W;W\n0\n\u001a N:\nThis condition ensures that the order of deletion of weakly dominated\nstrategies does not matter\n6\n, and thus implies that is important to ensure that\nthe solution concept we use is well de\fned. Our second assumption, already\nmade above, and purely for convenience, is that voters cannot abstain.\n3 Analysis\nLet (\r\n\u0003\n; \u000b\n\u0003\n(:)) be some WUPE, and let C(\r\n\u0003\n) = C\n\u0003\nbe the equilibrium\nset of candidates given entry decisions \r\n\u0003\n: We will show that as long as\n#C\n\u0003\n\u0014 3; for any WUPE with equilibrium candidate set C\n\u0003\n; and winset\nW (C\n\u0003\n; \u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n)); there is a IWUPE (\r\n\u0003\u0003\n; \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(:)) with the same equilibrium\nset of candidates and the same winset - and therefore the same outcome in\nterms of policy chosen and political representation.\n6\nThat is, the calculation ofA\n1\ndoes not depend on the order in which weakly dominated\nstrategies are deleted. See Marx and Swinkels (1997).\n6\nWe proceed as follows. First, \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(:) must generate the same winset as\n\u000b\n\u0003\n(:) when the candidate set is the equilibrium one:\nW (C; \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n)) = W (C; \u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n)) (3)\nSecond, the incentives to enter must be the same in the original WUPE and\nthe constructed IWUPE. That is, the entry conditions (1),(2) must continue\nto hold when \u000b\n\u0003\nis replaced by \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\ni.e.\nu\ni\n(\u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n=fig); C\n\u0003\n=fig) \u0014 u\ni\n(\u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n); C\n\u0003\n)\u0000 \u00c6; i 2 C\n\u0003\n(4)\nu\nk\n(\u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n[ fkg); C\n\u0003\n[ fkg)\u0000 \u00c6 \u0014 u\nk\n(\u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n); C\n\u0003\n); j =2 C\n\u0003\n(5)\nSo, for any C\n\u0003\nwith #C\n\u0003\n\u0014 3; we must show that we can construct some\n\u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n2 A\n1\nsuch that (3)-(5) hold.\nNow let \t be the set of candidate sets comprising C\n\u0003\nand those sets aris-\ning from unilateral deviations from equilibrium entry decisions\n7\n. Note that\nconditions (3)-(5) impose conditions on \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(C) when C 2 \t: For candidate\nsets not in \t; \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(:) can be de\fned arbitrarily, subject to the requirement\nthat it is an iteratively undominated pro\fle. That is, we can set\n\u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(C) 2 A\n1\n(C); all C 2 N =\t\n\u0003\n(6)\nwhere N is the power set of N: Note that (6) is always possible as A\n1\n(C) is\nalways non-empty for all non-empty C:\nIt is helpful to break our complex task into steps by classifying political\nequilibria by the number of candidates. Following Besley and Coate, 1997,\nsay that a political equilibrium is a m\u0000candidate political equilibrium if m\ncandidates stand for election in the equilibrium. We \frst have:\n7\nFormally,\n\t = fC \u001a N jC = C\n\u0003\n; C = C\n\u0003\n=fig; i 2 C\n\u0003\n; C = C\n\u0003\n[ fjg; j =2 C\n\u0003\ng\n7\nProposition 1. For any 1-candidate WUPE with equilibrium candidate set\nC\n\u0003\n= fig; and winset W (C\n\u0003\n; \u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n)) = fig; there is a IWUPE (\r\n\u0003\u0003\n; \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(:))\nwith the same equilibrium set of candidates and the same winset.\nProof. First, \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(:) is de\fned\n8\non \t as follows. For C = fig; or C =\nfi; jg; j 2 N; set \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(:) = \u000b\n\u0003\n(:): As we have set \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(:) = \u000b\n\u0003\n(:); (3)-(5) hold\nfrom the fact that \u000b\n\u0003\n(:) is part of a WUPE. To conclude, we must verify that\n\u000b\n\u0003\n(C) is iteratively undominated for all C 2 \t: The case C = fig is trivial,\nas every voter has only one strategy, so we must have A\n1\n(i) = A\n1\n(i) = fig\nn\n:\nIn the case C = fi; jg; j 2 N , the only undominated strategy for any voter\nis to vote sincerely, so A\n1\n(C) is a singleton, so again iterated deletion does\nnot reduce it i.e. A\n1\n(C) = A\n1\n(C): \u0003\nTo deal with two-candidate equilibria, we \frst need the following Lem-\nmas. Let \u0000(C) be the voting (subgame) with candidate set C: A strict Nash\nequilibrium (Harsanyi, 1973) of \u0000(C) is a vector of voting decisions \u000b\n\u0003\nwhere\nu\ni\n(\u000b\n\u0003\ni\n; \u000b\n\u0003\n\u0000i\n) > u\ni\n(\u000b\ni\n; \u000b\n\u0003\n\u0000i\n) all \u000b\ni\n2 C; \u000b\ni\n6= \u000b\n\u0003\ni\n; all i 2 N: We then have:\nLemma 1. Any strict Nash equilibrium \u000b\n\u0003\nis iteratively undominated i.e.\n\u000b\n\u0003\n2 A\n1\n:\nProof. A strict Nash equilibrium is a pro\fle of pure strategies (\u000b\n\u0003\n1\n; \u000b\n\u0003\n2\n; :::; \u000b\n\u0003\nn\n);\nsuch that each \u000b\n\u0003\ni\nis a unique best response to the pro\fle \u000b\n\u0003\n\u0000i\n. Thus, none\nof these strategies can be deleted in the \frst round. Moreover if this pro\fle\nsurvives for all players at any round k of iterated deletion, they must survive\nin round k + 1. This is because iterated deletion means that any player has\nthe same or fewer strategies at every round, so if a strategy was a unique\nbest response to a pro\fle which survived round k, it will continue to be a\nunique best response to this pro\fle in round k + 1. \u0003\nFor the proof of the next Lemma, the following notation will be useful. Let\n!\n\u0000i\n(\u000b\n\u0000i\n) be a vector recording the total votes for each candidate; given a\nstrategy pro\fle \u000b\n\u0000i\ni.e. when individual i is not included. We suppress\nthe dependence of !\n\u0000i\non \u000b\n\u0000i\nexcept when needed and refer to !\n\u0000i\nas a vote\n8\nObviously, C=fig = ;; so \u000b(;) is not de\fned.\n8\ndistribution. Clearly i's best response to !\n\u0000i\ndepends only on the information\nin !\n\u0000i\n.\nLemma 2. Any weakly undominated Nash equilibrium \u000b\n\u0003\n(C) of a voting\ngame \u0000(C); where #W (\u000b\n\u0003\n; C) > 1 is a iteratively weakly undominated\nNash equilibrium, and remains so even in \u0000(C [ fkg) for any k 62 C:\nProof. Since all candidates in W (\u000b\n\u0003\n; C) are tied, i.e. !\ni\n= !\nj\n; 8i; j 2\nW (\u000b\n\u0003\n; C); it follows that every voter is pivotal between all elements of\nW (\u000b;C). Clearly, voting for his best alternative in W (\u000b\n\u0003\n; C) is a unique\nbest response for any voter\n9\n. Hence any weakly undominated Nash equilib-\nrium \u000b\n\u0003\nwith #W (\u000b\n\u0003\n; C) > 1 must be a strict Nash equilibrium. But then by\nLemma 1, \u000b\n\u0003\n(C) is also an iteratively weakly undominated Nash equilibrium.\nNow consider the game \u0000(C [ fkg). Assume that j is voter i\n0\ns most\npreferred candidate in W (\u000b\n\u0003\n; C). The vector of votes i faces given \u000b\n\u0003\n(C) is\nsuch that (w.l.o.g.) !\nj\n= !\nl\n\u0000 1; 8l 6= j; and j; l 2 W (C): It is su\u00c6cient to\nshow that voting for candidate k is not a best response for i in \u0000(C [ fkg).\nNote that n \u0015 3 since #W (C) > 1; so #C > 1: Therefore, n \u0015 4 (otherwise\nwe cannot have a tie between two candidates in the two candidate game).\nThus, if voter i deviates to k, he would ensure thatW (C[fkg) = W (Cnfjg):\nThus, voting for j remains a unique best response. Thus, \u000b\n\u0003\n(C) remains a\nstrict Nash equilibrium of the game \u0000(C[fkg). Again, by Lemma 1, \u000b\n\u0003\n(C) is\nalso an iteratively weakly undominated Nash equilibrium in \u0000(C [ fkg). \u0003\nWe now turn to two-candidate WUPE. Note that the entry condition (1)\nrequires that if there are two candidates, both must be in the winset - oth-\nerwise, the one that does not win would withdraw (Besley and Coate(1997).\nSo, our second result is:\nProposition 2. For any 2-candidate WUPE with equilibrium candidate\nset C\n\u0003\n= fi; jg; and winset W (C\n\u0003\n; \u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n)) = fi; jg; there is an IWUPE\n(\r\n\u0003\u0003\n; \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(:)) with the same equilibrium set of candidates and the same win-\nset.\n9\nThis also implies, given our NI condition, that all voters will vote for their best\nalternative in W (C).\n9\nProof. First, \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(:) is de\fned\n10\non \t as follows. For C = C\n\u0003\n; or C = C\n\u0003\n=fig;\ni 2 C\n\u0003\n; set \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(:) = \u000b\n\u0003\n(:): For C = C\n\u0003\n[ fkg; k =2 C\n\u0003\n; set \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n[ fkg) =\n\u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n): Note that by construction, (3),(4) are satis\fed. Also, note that (5)\nis satis\fed. First, note that\nW (C\n\u0003\n[ fkg; \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n[ fkg)) =W (C\n\u0003\n[ fkg; \u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n)) = W (C\n\u0003\n; \u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n)) (7)\ni.e. given \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n; the winner is unchanged if k enters: So, from (7),\nu\nk\n(\u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n[ fkg); C\n\u0003\n[ fkg) = u\nk\n(\u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n); C\n\u0003\n)\nand consequently (5) holds as \u00c6 > 0:\nAgain, to conclude, we must verify that \u000b\n\u0003\n(C) is iteratively undominated\nfor all C 2 \t: For C = C\n\u0003\n; or C = C\n\u0003\n=fig; i 2 C\n\u0003\n, an argument identical to\nthe proof of Proposition 1 shows this. For C = C\n\u0003\n[ fkg; Lemma 2 implies\nthat \u000b\n\u0003\n(C) is an iteratively undominated voting pro\fle in the game \u0000(C\n\u0003\n[k);\nas required. \u0003\nWe now turn to the most complex case, that of 3-candidate WUPE. First,\nwith three candidates, there may in principle, be one, two or three winners. It\nturns out that the case of two winners is impossible under our assumption of\nstrict preferences. The case of three winners can be dealt with using Lemma\n2, following the proof of Proposition 2. However, in the case of one winner,\nLemma 2 no longer applies, and so we must \fnd some other argument to\nconstruct an IWUPE with one winner. To illustrate our argument, we \frst\npresent an example of a 3-candidate WUPE with one winner where we can\n\fnd an IWUPE with the same outcome.\nWe need the following notation and lemma before this example. Fix some\ncandidate set C with #C = 3: Let N\ni\nbe the set of voters who rank candidate\ni 2 C as worst, with n\ni\n= #N\ni\n. Let q = max\nl2C\nfn\nl\n=ng, and let w\ni\ndenote\ncitizen i\n0\ns worst candidate in C; all i 2 N . Now de\fne a critical value of q\nas:\nq\nn\n=\n(\n1\u0000\n1\nn\n\u0000\n1\nn\nd\nn+1\n3\ne; nodd\n1\u0000\n1\nn\nd\nn+2\n3\ne; n even\n(8)\n10\nObviously, C=fig = ;; so \u000b(;) is not de\fned.\n10\nwhere dxe denotes the smallest integer larger than x; and bxc denotes the\nlargest integer smaller than x: Finally, in this section, we assume that n \u0015\n4:\n11\nWe then have the following useful result, constructed from various results\nof Dhillon and Lockwood, 2000:\nLemma 3. Assume #C = 3: If q \u0014 q\nn\n, then any weakly undominated\nstrategy pro\fle in \u0000(C) is also iteratively weakly undominated i.e. A\n1\n(C) =\nA\n1\n(C): Moreover, A\n1\n(C) is a subset of the set of iteratively undominated\nstrategy pro\fles in \u0000(C [ flg) i.e. A\n1\n(C) \u001a A\n1\n(C [ flg):\nProof. Every \u000b\ni\n2 C except \u000b\ni\n= w\ni\nis weakly undominated in C; so\nA\n1\n(C) = \u0002\ni\n(C=w\ni\n) (Dhillon and Lockwood, Lemma 1). Moreover, by Theo-\nrem 2 of Dhillon and Lockwood, as q \u0014 q\nn\n; A\n1\n(C) = \u0002\ni\n(C=w\ni\n): So,A\n1\n(C) =\nA\n1\n(C) as required. Finally, consider \u0000(C [ flg): De\fne the full reduction of\n(C [ flg)\nn\n; V = \u0002\ni\nV\ni\n; to be the set of strategy pro\fles where every \u000b\ni\n2 V\ni\nis iteratively undominated relative to V (Marx and Swinkels(1997)). Then,\nby de\fnition, V = A\n1\n(C [ flg): We will show that A\n1\n(C) \u001a V: To do this,\nit is su\u00c6cient to show (i) that every \u000b\ni\n2 C=w\ni\nis undominated relative to\n(C[flg)\nn\nand (ii)it remains undominated in every subsequent stage of dele-\ntion. In turn, it is su\u00c6cient to show that every \u000b\ni\nis a unique best response\nin C [ flg to some \u000b\n\u0000i\nin (C [ flg)\nn\u00001\n; and that it remains a unique best\nresponse in any subsequent stage of iterated deletion.\nTo prove this, let ~\u000b\ni\n2 C=w\ni\n: As ~\u000b\ni\n2 A\n1\n(C); there exists ~\u000b\n\u0000i\n2 A\n1\n\u0000i\n(C)\nsuch that ~\u000b\ni\nis the unique best response in A\n1\ni\n(C) to ~\u000b\n\u0000i\n. Note that the\nsupport of the set A\n1\n(C) consists of pure strategies that are a unique best\nresponse to some pro\fle which is also in A\n1\n(C): Thus, consider the \frst stage\nof iterated deletion in the game \u0000(C [ flg). We know that the set A\n1\n(C)\n\u001a A\n1\n(C [ flg); because A\n1\n(C) = A\n1\n(C) \u001a A\n1\n(C [ flg). Thus no strategy\nin A\n1\n(C) is deleted in the \frst round if we can show that ~\u000b\ni\ncontinues to be\nthe unique best response in A\n1\ni\n(C) (and hence in A\n1\n(C [flg)) to ~\u000b\n\u0000i\n; when\nvoter i can also choose l:\nTo see this, let ~\u000b\ni\n= j and note that since q \u0014 q\nn\nfor \u0000(C), ~\u000b\ni\nis a\n11\nThis is w.l.o.g since we only need this for the proof of the main Propositions.\n11\nunique best response to the pro\fle ~\u000b\n\u0000i\nwhere i is pivotal between exactly\ntwo alternatives w.l.o.g fi; jg \u001a C. Thus, the vote distribution !\n\u0000i\n(~\u000b\n\u0000i\n)\nmust have one of the two alternatives (i; j) in C getting two or more votes\nwhen n \u0015 4: So, voting \u000b\ni\n= l in response to ~\u000b\n\u0000i\ncannot a\u000bect the outcome,\nand so ~\u000b\ni\nremains a unique best response in \u0000(C [ flg) to ~\u000b\n\u0000i\n: This proves\nthat every pure strategy in the support of A\n1\nremains a unique best response\nin A\n1\n(C [ flg). In particular, the strategy pro\fle ~\u000b\n\u0000i\nalso cannot be deleted\nin the \frst round.\nMoreover, if ~\u000b\ni\n; ~\u000b\n\u0000i\n; are not deleted in the \frst round they cannot be deleted\nin any subsequent round since no new strategies are added. \u0003\nThis is a powerful result which allows treatment of the 3-candidate case.\nExample\nThere are eight citizens with preferences over N as follows:\n1 : 1 \u001f 8 \u001f 5 \u001f 3 \u001f 2 \u001f 4 \u001f 6 \u001f 7\n2 : 2 \u001f 8 \u001f 1 \u001f 3 \u001f 5 \u001f 4 \u001f 6 \u001f 7\n3 : 3 \u001f 8 \u001f 5 \u001f 1 \u001f 2 \u001f 4 \u001f 6 \u001f 7\n4 : 4 \u001f 8 \u001f 5 \u001f 3 \u001f 1 \u001f 2 \u001f 6 \u001f 7\n5 : 5 \u001f 8 \u001f 1 \u001f 3 \u001f 2 \u001f 4 \u001f 6 \u001f 7\n6 : 6 \u001f 8 \u001f 1 \u001f 3 \u001f 5 \u001f 2 \u001f 4 \u001f 7\n7 : 7 \u001f 8 \u001f 1 \u001f 3 \u001f 5 \u001f 2 \u001f 4 \u001f 6\n8 : 8 \u001f 5 \u001f 3 \u001f 1 \u001f 2 \u001f 4 \u001f 6 \u001f 7\nLet (\r\n\u0003\n; \u000b\n\u0003\n(:)) represent a WUPE in this game, with an equilibrium set of\n3 candidates C\n\u0003\n= f1; 3; 5g; and one winner, W (C\n\u0003\n; \u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n)) = f5g: We\nwill \frst describe \u000b\n\u0003\n(:) and verify that it does induce the equilibrium entry\ndecisions. Then, we will show that there is an IWUPE with the same set of\ncandidates and winset.\nDescription of \u000b\n\u0003\n(:)\n12\nFirst, \u000b(C\n\u0003\n) = (5; 1; 5; 5; 5; 1; 3; 5); thus candidate 5 wins. This is a Nash\nequilibrium, since no voter is pivotal, and moreover, the pro\fle is undomi-\nnated (\u000b(C\n\u0003\n) 2 A\n1\n(C\n\u0003\n)) as no-one votes for their worst candidate.\nVoting pro\fles and winsets in all the two candidate games generated by\nwithdrawal of one of the equilibrium candidates are as follows:\n\u000b(C\n\u0003\n=f1g) = (5; 3; 3; 5; 5; 3; 3; 5); W (C\n\u0003\n=f1g) = f3; 5g\n\u000b(C\n\u0003\n=f3g) = (1; 1; 5; 5; 5; 1; 1; 5); W (C\n\u0003\n=f3g) = f1; 5g\n\u000b(C\n\u0003\n=f5g) = (1; 1; 3; 3; 1; 1; 1; 3); W (C\n\u0003\n=f5g) = f1g\nIt is clear that withdrawal is suboptimal for all candidates. For example,\nif candidate 1 withdraws, he gets a lottery over 3 and 5 which is worse for\nhim than 5: Finally, note that all these voting pro\fles are undominated Nash\nequilibrium ones, as there are only two alternatives and voting is sincere.\nNext, note that if \u000b\n\u0003\n(C) 2 A\n1\n(C [ fjg); j = 2; 4; 6; 7; then j cannot win in\n\u0000(C [ fjg): This is because j is ranked worst in C [ fjg = f1; 3; 5; jg by all\nplayers except j himself, an is a dominated strategy to vote for one's worst\nalternative. So, in equilibrium, j = 2; 4; 6; 7 will not enter, as required.\nFinally, consider subgame \u0000(C\n\u0003\n[f8g):We set \u000b(C\n\u0003\n[f8g) = \u000b(C\n\u0003\n): This\nis an undominated Nash equilibrium, as shown above. Moreover, W (C\n\u0003\n[\nf8g) = f5g; so that 8 has no incentive to enter, as required.\nConstruction of the Equivalent IWUPE\nLet \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(:) \u0011 \u000b\n\u0003\n(:) on \t: It is then obvious that \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\ninduces the same\nentry behavior as \u000b\n\u0003\n:It remains to check that \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(C) is iteratively undom-\ninated for all C 2 \t. First, in \u0000(C\n\u0003\n), note from (8) that q(C\n\u0003\n) = 3=8 <\nq\n3\n8\n= 1=2: Hence by Lemma 3 above, \u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n) 2 A\n1\n(C\n\u0003\n) for all i. Next, in\n\u0000(C\n\u0003\n=fig); \u000b\n\u0003\nis iteratively undominated, as there are only two alterna-\ntives (formally, \u000b\n\u0003\n(C=fig) 2 A\n1\n(C=fig); i 2 C). Finally, in \u0000(C\n\u0003\n[ flg);\n\u000b\n\u0003\n(C) 2 A\n1\n(C) = A\n1\n(C\n\u0003\n[ flg); again by Lemma 3. k\nWe ncan generalise the arguments used in this example to prove:\nProposition 3. For any 3-candidateWUPE there is an IWUPE (\r\n\u0003\u0003\n; \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(:))\nwith the same equilibrium set of candidates and the same winset.\n13\nProof of Proposition 3. We divide the proof into three parts: (A) where\nthree candidates win, (B) where two candidates win and (C) where only one\ncandidate wins.\n(A) Assume that C\n\u0003\n= fi; j; kg; W (C\n\u0003\n) = C\n\u0003\n: Now de\fne \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(:) on \t as\nfollows. For C = C\n\u0003\n; or C = C\n\u0003\n=flg; l 2 C\n\u0003\n; set \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(:) = \u000b\n\u0003\n(:): For\nC = C\n\u0003\n[ fmg; m =2 C\n\u0003\n; set \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n[ fmg) = \u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n): Then, by an identical\nargument to that of the proof of Proposition 2, (3),(4),(5) are satis\fed.\nAgain, to conclude, we must verify that \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(C) is iteratively undominated\nin \u0000(C) for all C 2 \t: Since W (C\n\u0003\n) = C\n\u0003\n; #W (C) > 1 so by Lemma\n2, \u000b\n\u0003\n(C\n\u0003\n) is an iteratively weakly undominated Nash equilibrium in \u0000(C\n\u0003\n)\nand remains so even in \u0000(C\n\u0003\n[ fkg) for any k 62 C: This leaves the two\ncandidate games \u0000(C=flg); l = i; j; k : here there is nothing to prove as\nwith two alternatives, an undominated Nash equilibrium is also iteratively\nundominated.\nCase(B): We show that a 3-candidate WUPE where two candidates tie is\nimpossible in our framework with strict preferences. Suppose that such a\nWUPE exists: C\n\u0003\n= fi; j; kg; W (C\n\u0003\n) = fi; jg: Then we must have i; j\ngetting equal numbers of votes. Since votes are split equally between two\ncandidates, n \u0015 4 (since there are three citizen candidates) and n is even.\nMoreover, all voters are pivotal, so the unique best response for a voter is\nto vote for her preferred alternative in fi; jg: So, we know exactly half the\nvoters prefer i to j and vice versa.\nAlso, since this is a WUPE, the entry conditions for the three candidates\nare satis\fed. For i; j this implies that entry costs are su\u00c6ciently low, and for\ncandidate k it must be that the outcome if he does not enter is less preferred\nby him to a tie between i; and j. W.l.o.g. let W (C\n\u0003\n=fkg) = fig; and let\nk prefer j to i: This implies that in \u0000(fi; jg); i wins. In turn since only\nequilibria with sincere voting are possible in the two candidate voting game,\nthis implies that a majority of citizens prefer i to j, a contradiction. So, case\n(B) cannot arise.\nCase (C). Assume that C\n\u0003\n= fi; j; kg; W (C\n\u0003\n) = fig: We prove \frst that in\n14\nthis case there must be at least 4 voters:\nClaim 1: If a three candidate WUPE in case (C) exists, then n \u0015 4.\nProof in the Appendix\nNow de\fne \u000b\n\u0003\u0003\n(:) on \t as follows.

Intuitively it\nis easy to see why re\fnements become easier with the four candidate case.\nConsider WUPE where one candidate wins in a four candidate race. Unlike\n15\nthe entry conditions in the three candidate case, the entry conditions in the\nfour candidate case involve three candidates (and 5 candidates) and hence\nmay involve insincere voting, thus imposing fewer restrictions on preferences\n(e.g. in the example we needed n\n1\n; n\n3\n\u0014 n=2). In the proof of Proposition\n3 above, since two candidate elections involve sincere voting only, n\nj\nand n\nk\nwere restricted to be less than half of n. Such a restriction would not arise\nin the four candidate case, and it is easy to \fnd WUPE outcomes that are\nnot supported by any IWUPE.\n16\nReferences\n1.

It is su\u00c6cient to show that if a WUPE exists, then\nn > 3; since there are three candidates. Let the three citizen candidates be\ni; j; k: Let W (C) = fig as before. Suppose to the contrary that a WUPE\nexists with n = 3. Since a WUPE exists, i enters because he wins against\nthe other two. Thus in \u0000(C), n\ni\n\u0014 1. Moreover, j (k) enters because he\nprefers i to k (j) and it must be that \u0000(C\u0000fjg) = k (\u0000(C\u0000fkg) = j): since\nn = 3 two candidates cannot tie. Thus n\nj\n; n\nk\n\u0014 1. Thus n\ni\n= n\nj\n= n\nk\n= 1.\nW.l.o.g let N\ni\n= fjg { this is a contradiction to the entry condition for j (i.e.\nj prefers i to k). \u0003\nProof of Claim 2. Since a WUPE exists, candidates j; k must have some in-\ncentive to enter. In particular, we cannot have W (C\n\u0003\n=fjg) = fig (otherwise\nfrom (1), j would not enter), so (i) W (C\n\u0003\n=fjg) = fkg or fi; kg and more-\nover, j must prefer i to k; otherwise gain, j would not enter. A symmetric\nargument implies that (ii) W (C\n\u0003\n=fkg) = fjg or fi; jg:\nSince the only undominated Nash equilibrium with in two candidates is\nsincere voting, (i) and (ii) imply that at least half the voters prefer j to i\nand at least half the voters prefer k to i: So, no more than half the voters can\nrank either j or k as worst. \u0003\nProof of Claim 3. Since there is a WUPE where i is the unique equilibrium\noutcome in the game with three candidates, it must be that a su\u00c6ciently\nlarge number of voters have i as a top or second ranked alternative among\nthe three i.e. n\ni\nmust be su\u00c6ciently low. We look for the maximum n\ni\nthat\nis compatible with i being a unique winner. Thus, we can assume that all\n!\ni\n= n\u0000n\ni\ni.e. all n\u0000n\ni\nvoters vote for i. Note that in such an equilibrium,\nby the example we have maxn\ni\n> 0.\nIn such an equilibrium it must be true either that (i) !\ni\n\u0015 max(!\nj\n; !\nk\n)+2\nor that (ii) only two candidates i, j get any votes at all. To see this, suppose\n\frst that (i) is not true. Then the vote pro\fle is w.l.o.g !\ni\n= !; !\nj\n= ! \u0000 1\nand !\nk\n\u0014 ! \u0000 1. Consider any voter m 2 N\ni\n: It is su\u00c6cient to show that no\nvoter would vote for k { thus assume he votes for k. Then he faces a vote\n18\npro\fle !\n\u0000i\nsuch that (a) !\ni\n= !; !\nj\n= ! \u0000 1 and !\nk\n\u0014 ! \u0000 2. But then he is\nstrictly better o\u000b voting for j since that ensures a tie.\nThus, in case (ii) the only case in which i can emerge a unique winner is if\nall m 2 N\ni\nvote for j and the maximum votes that j can get (= n \u0000 n\nj\n) is\nstrictly less than ! = n \u0000 n\ni\n. This implies, n\ni\n< n\nj\n: But this is impossible\n(Claim 1 { in the 2 candidate game between i; j, j must be in the winning\nset).\nIt remains to check case (i) i.e. the pro\fle !\ni\n\u0015 max(!\nj\n; !\nk\n) + 2. Thus we\nhave the following constraints\n12\n:\n!\ni\n= (n\u0000 n\ni\n) \u0015 max(!\nj\n; !\nk\n) + 2 (9)\nmax(!\nj\n; !\nk\n) = d\nn\ni\n2\ne (10)\nCombining the two, we have:\nd\n3n\ni\n2\ne \u0014 n\u0000 2 (11)\nFrom inequality (11) and the requirement that n\ni\nis an integer we have:\nd\n2\n3\n(n\u0000 2)e \u0015 n\ni\n(12)\nThus:\nn\ni\nn\n\u0014\n1\nn\nb\n2(n\u0000 2)\n3\nc = \u001e\nNote that b\n2(n\u00002)\n3\nc is an integer if and only if d\nn+4\n3\ne is an integer. Hence\nb\n2(n\u00002)\n3\nc +d\nn+4\n3\ne = n ; 8n; from which we get:\n\u001e = 1\u0000\n1\nn\nd\nn+ 4\n3\ne (13)\nBut then (12) and (13) yield the right result. \u0003\n12\nThanks are due to an anonymous referee who suggested this part of the proof.\n19\n"}
