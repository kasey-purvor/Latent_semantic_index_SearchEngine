If the game\nis symmetric, has a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium, and players\u2019 payoffs are\nmonotonic in the opponent\u2019s choice along their own best reply function, then the\nfollower payoff is either higher than the leader payoff, or even lower than in the\nsimultaneous game. This gap for the possible follower payoff had not been observed\nin earlier duopoly models of endogenous timing.\nKeywords: Cournot, duopoly game, endogenous timing, follower, leader, Stackel-\nberg, strategic complements, strategic substitutes.\nJEL Classification Numbers: C72, D43, L13.\n1\n1 Introduction\nThe classic duopoly model of quantity competition by Cournot (1838) is a game between\ntwo firms that simultaneously choose quantities, with Cournot\u2019s solution as the unique\nNash equilibrium. The \u201cleadership game\u201d of von Stackelberg (1934) uses the same payoff\nfunctions, but where one firm, the leader, moves first, assuming a best reply of the second-\nmoving firm, the follower. The Stackelberg solution is then a subgame perfect equilibrium\nof this sequential game.\nMany recent papers are concerned with endogenizing the \u201ctiming\u201d in the sequential\ngame, that is, the order of play which determines the roles of leader and follower. In\na much-cited paper, Hamilton and Slutsky (1990) take a given duopoly game and let\nplayers decide to act in one of two periods. If one player moves in the first period and\nthe other in the second, they become leader and follower, respectively. If they move in\nthe same period, their payoffs are as in simultaneous play. The leader-follower outcome\nis a Nash equilibrium of the two-period game only if the follower\u2019s payoff is not smaller\nthan her Nash payoff in the simultaneous game. In that case, there are typically two pure\nNash equilibria, with either order of play; van Damme and Hurkens (1999; 2004) use\nrisk dominance to select one of these equilibria. If the follower would suffer compared to\nsimultaneous play, both players act in the first period, using their equilibrium strategies\nfrom the simultaneous game.\nThese papers and others (for example, Amir (1995)) compare explicitly the follower\npayoff to the payoff the player would get as a leader or in simultaneous play. The point\nof the present paper is a simple observation which so far, apparently, has not been made\nexplicitly: If the game is symmetric and certain standard assumptions hold, then the fol-\nlower gets either less than in the simultaneous game, or more than the leader. That is,\nthe seemingly natural case that both players profit from sequential play as compared to\nsimultaneous play, but the leader more so than if he was follower, can only occur in non-\nsymmetric games.\nOur assumptions about the duopoly game are designed to be general while allowing\nfor a very simple proof. Apart from symmetry, we assume intervals as strategy spaces,\nunique best replies, a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium in the simultaneous game, and\nmonotonicity of payoffs in the other player\u2019s strategy along the own best reply function.\nThese assumptions encompass many duopoly models of quantity or price compe-\ntition. Hamilton and Slutsky (1990) make similar assumptions. Gal-Or (1985) com-\npares leader and follower payoffs for identical firms with differentiable payoff functions.\nDowrick (1986) assumes specific functional forms of quantity competition or price com-\npetition with heterogeneous goods, and also looks at simultaneous play.\nThe following papers on endogenous timing differ from our setup, and give further\nreferences, in particular to applied work in industrial organization. Boyer and Moreaux\n(1987) allow firms to choose both prices and quantities. Deneckere and Kovenock (1992)\nstudy duopolies with price setting and capacity constraints. Amir and Grilo (1999) and\nAmir, Grilo, and Jin (1999) allow for multiple Nash equilibria in the simultaneous game\n2\nand use the theory of supermodular games (see also Vives (1999)). Tasna\u00b4di (2003) con-\nsiders price setting with homogeneous goods.\nLeadership in mixed extensions of finite games is analyzed by von Stengel and Zamir\n(2004), with an example (in Section 7) of a symmetric game where the follower payoff\ncan be arbitrary relative to leader payoff and simultaneous payoff. In this example, each\nplayer\u2019s strategy set is not an interval but a two-dimensional mixed strategy simplex.\nWhen considering mixed strategies, best replies are not unique. To keep the present study\nshort, we do not consider best reply correspondences instead of functions.\nIn Section 2, we state and discuss our assumptions in detail, and state and prove the\nmain Theorem 1. We assume monotonicity only along the own best reply function, a\nproperty also used by Hamilton and Slutsky (1990, p. 41). Best reply functions do not\nhave to be monotonic.\nHowever, as discussed in Section 3, monotonic best replies determine the follower\npayoff. If the best reply function increases, then the follower profits from sequential play,\nand if it decreases, she suffers. For increasing best reply functions, this has been observed\nby Gal-Or (1985) and van Damme and Hurkens (2004, p. 405). For decreasing best reply\nfunctions, Gal-Or compares only follower and leader payoff, and does not consider the\nsimultaneous game. Games with increasing or decreasing best reply functions are often\ncalled games with strategic complements or substitutes, respectively.\nIn Section 4, we give examples showing that the main assumptions of symmetry and\nmonotonicity cannot be weakened.\n2 Assumptions and theorem\nThe duopoly games considered here are assumed to fulfill the following conditions.\n(a) The players\u2019 strategy sets are (not necessarily compact) real intervals X and Y , with\npayoff a(x,y) to player I and b(x,y) to player II for player I\u2019s strategy x in X and II\u2019s\nstrategy y in Y .\n(b) The best reply r(y) to y is always unique, a(r(y),y) = maxx\u2208X a(x,y), and so is the\nbest reply s(x) to x, with b(x,s(x)) = maxy\u2208Y b(x,y).\n(c) The payoffs a(r(y),y) and b(x,s(x)) are (not necessarily strictly) monotonic in y re-\nspectively x.\n(d) For some xL in X and yL in Y , the payoffs aL = a(xL,s(xL)) = maxx\u2208X a(x,s(x)) and\nbL = b(r(yL),yL) = maxy\u2208Y b(r(y),y) exist, which are the payoffs to player I and II\nwhen the respective player is a leader. Moreover, xL and yL are unique. The follower\npayoffs are denoted bF = b(xL,s(xL)) and aF = a(r(yL),yL).\n(e) The game is symmetric, that is, X = Y and a(x,y) = b(y,x), and for some yN in Y ,\n> <\nr(y) = y for y = yN .\n< >\n(1)\n3\nCondition (a) is, for example, fulfilled for X = Y = [0,\u221e). The payoff functions\nare typically continuous, but we do not require this. Condition (b) is strong but often\nmade. Condition (c) states that a player always prefers a higher or lower choice of the\nopponent along the own best reply function. Hamilton and Slutsky (1990, p. 41) assume\ncondition (c) for their Theorem VI.\nCondition (d) holds when payoffs are continuous and strategy sets are compact. With-\nout compactness, it may fail, for example in the symmetric game where x,y\u2265 0 and\na(x,y) = b(y,x) = 4y\u2212 (y+3)\n2\n4(x+1)\n\u2212 x (2)\nwhere r(y) = s(y) = (y+ 1)\/2, condition (c) holds since a(r(y),y) = 3y\u2212 2, and which\nhas a unique Nash equilibrium at x= y= 1, but where the leader payoff a(x,s(x)) exceeds\n15x\/16\u22122 and is therefore unbounded.\nGenerically, player I as leader has a unique payoff-maximizing strategy xL. If the\nleader\u2019s strategy is not unique, the follower payoff depends on which leader strategy is\nchosen. We assume uniqueness of xL and yL for simplicity. Otherwise, Theorem 1 below\nwould still apply, but then the follower payoffs have to be defined depending on the choice\nof the leader strategy.\nWhen the game is symmetric as stated in (e), then obviously s(x) = r(x), and the\ngame has a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium (xN ,yN) where xN = yN . Conversely, if\npayoff functions are continuous and the strategy sets are compact intervals, then (1) holds\nwhen the game has only one symmetric Nash equilibrium (to see this, consider the best\nreply function at the endpoints of the interval). Note that non-symmetric Nash equilibria\n(x,y) with x = r(y) and y = s(x) and x 6= y may exist. One may consider uniqueness of\nthe Nash equilibrium as an alternative to (e) when the game is not symmetric. However,\nexample (7) below shows that our theorem fails in this case.\nTheorem 1. Under conditions (a)\u2013(e), consider the leader payoff aL = a(xL,s(xL)) = bL,\nfollower payoff bF = b(xL,s(xL)), and Nash payoff aN = bN = b(xN ,yN), where xN = yN .\nThen bF > bL or bF \u2264 bN .\nProof. If bL = bN , the claim is trivial. Player I as leader can always get at least the Nash\npayoff aN by choosing xN . If xL = xN , then, since xL is unique by (d), aL = aN , that is,\nbL = bN , so we can assume aL > aN and thus xL 6= xN .\nWe can assume that a(r(y),y) is increasing in y, since if a(r(y),y) is decreasing in y\nwe can reverse the order on Y and X (by replacing y by \u2212y and x by \u2212x, say), so that (1)\ncontinues to hold. It may be useful to consider the example in Figure 1, explained after\nthis proof, for the following argument.\nIf xL < xN , then, since s(x) = r(x),\nbF = b(xL,s(xL)) = a(r(xL),xL)\u2264 a(r(xN),xN) = bN .\nIf xL > xN = yN , then r(xL)< xL by (1). Thus,\nbL = aL = a(xL,r(xL))< a(r(r(xL)),r(xL))\u2264 a(r(xL),xL) = b(xL,s(xL)) = bF .\n4\nThe first inequality holds since r(r(xL)) is the unique best reply to r(xL), which is different\nfrom xL, since otherwise r(r(xL)) = xL > r(xL) and thus r(xL)< xN by (1), giving\naL = a(xL,r(xL))\u2264 a(r(r(xL)),r(xL))\u2264 a(r(xN),xN) = aN (3)\nwhich we have excluded; so r(r(xL)) 6= xL and the inequality is strict.\nThe proof shows that if condition (c) is strengthened so that a(r(y),y) is strictly mono-\ntonic in y, then the follower payoff bF is strictly less than the Nash payoff bN if it is not\ngreater than the leader payoff (unless all these payoffs coincide).\n3\n5\n0\nx\ny\n4\n420 1\n3\n5\n1\n2\n3\n2\n5\n4\n1\n20 1\n3\n0\nx\ny\n4 5\nFigure 1 Contour lines of a(x,y) in (4) for \u03b1 = 0.7 (left) and \u03b1 = 10 (right). The thick\nline is player II\u2019s best reply function s(x) = r(x) with xL = 0.121 (left) and\nxL = 2.808 (right), with (xL,s(xL)) indicated by a big dot.\nIf the best reply function is monotonic, then the game has strategic substitutes or\ncomplements, where Theorem 1 presents a familiar results; we discuss this relationship\nin the next section. The following example shows that Theorem 1 holds even if the best\nreply function is not monotonic: Let x,y\u2265 0 and consider the function, which will be the\nbest reply function of player I,\nr(y) =\n3\n2\n\u2212 1\n(y\u22121)2+1 .\nThis function decreases for y \u2208 [0,1], with r(0) = 1, and increases from its minimum at\ny = 1 for y\u2265 1. We consider the game with payoff functions\na(x,y) = b(y,x) =\u2212x\n2\n2\n+ x \u00b7 r(y)+\u03b1 \u00b7 y (4)\n5\nfor \u03b1 = 0.7 and \u03b1 = 10. Then ddxa(x,y) = \u2212x+ r(y), which is zero if and only if x =\nr(y), and r(y) is indeed player I\u2019s best reply to y. Figure 1 shows the contour lines of\na(x,y), with r(y) shown as the thin curve defined by the points where the contours have a\nhorizontal tangent. Moreover, a(r(y),y) is strictly increasing in y. Player II\u2019s best reply is\ngiven by s(x) = r(x), shown as a thick curve in Figure 1. The symmetric Nash equilibrium\n(xN ,xN) at the intersection of the best reply curves is obtained for approximately xN =\n0.634. In the leadership game, player I maximizes a(x,s(x)) on player II\u2019s curve with the\nresulting value xL = 0.121 < xN for \u03b1 = 0.7 and xL = 2.808 > xN for \u03b1 = 10, indicated\nby a dot; the two values for \u03b1 correspond to the two cases in the proof of Theorem 1.\n3 Strategic complements and substitutes\nPlayers\u2019 strategies are called strategic substitutes if the best reply to \u201cmore aggressive\u201d\nbehavior is \u201cless aggressive\u201d behavior, and strategic complements if the best reply to\n\u201cmore aggressive\u201d behavior is \u201cmore aggressive\u201d behavior. We use this terminology, in\nterms of best replies, following Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (1995, p. 415). Assume\nthat \u201caggressive behavior\u201d is an order on the strategy set (here an interval) representing the\nnegative preference of the other player. For example, in quantity competition, player I typ-\nically prefers a lower quantity y of the other firm, as \u201cless aggressive\u201d behavior, because\na(x,y) is decreasing in y. In price competition, players typically prefer a higher price of\nthe opponent as \u201cless aggressive\u201d. Then strategic substitutes correspond to decreasing\nbest reply functions, and strategic complements to increasing best reply functions. This\ndoes not depend on the chosen order on the interval as long as it is the same for both\nplayers.\nIf a(x,y) is monotonic in y, the same monotonicity in y holds for a(r(y),y), as in\nassumption (c):\nLemma 2. Given (a) and (b), if a(x,y) is (strictly or non-strictly) increasing or decreasing\nin y, then so is a(r(y),y).\nProof. For y,y\u2032 \u2208 Y and y < y\u2032, and a(x,y) strictly increasing in y, we have\na(r(y),y)< a(r(y),y\u2032)\u2264 a(r(y\u2032),y\u2032). (5)\nIf a(x,y) is strictly decreasing in y, we conclude (5) from y > y\u2032. For non-strict mono-\ntonicity, replace < by \u2264 in (5).\nAs mentioned, Hamilton and Slutsky (1990, p. 41) assume condition (c) for their\nTheorem VI. Amir (1995) notes that this condition is also necessary for their Theorem V,\nalthough he uses the stronger assumption that a(x,y) is monotonic in y.\nMonotonicity of a(r(y),y) in y is strictly weaker than monotonicity of a(x,y) in y. In\nthe following example with x,y\u2265 0 and\na(x,y) = (2x\u2212 (y+1)) \u00b7 (y+1\u2212 x), (6)\n6\nwhere a(x,y) \u2265 0 for 2x\u22121 \u2265 y \u2265 x\u2212 1, we have r(y) = 3(y+1)\/4, which is a linearly\nincreasing best reply function. Here, a(r(y),y) = (y+1)2\/8, which is strictly increasing\nin y, but a(x,y) is not monotonic in y. If (6) defines a symmetric game with a(x,y) =\nb(y,x), then Theorem 1 applies with xN = 3, xL = 4.2, s(xL) = 3.9, and bN = 2, bL = 2.45,\nbF = 3.38.\nStrategic complements and substitutes mean that r(y) increases or decreases, respec-\ntively. Even when only a(r(y),y) increases in y (but not generally a(x,y) in y), this can be\nreasonably interpreted as a unique preference of player I for larger values of y as \u201cless ag-\ngressive behavior\u201d. Then strategic complements and substitutes give rise to the two cases\nbF > bL and bF \u2264 bN , respectively, in Theorem 1. We exclude the trivial case bL = bN ,\nwhich arises, for example, when there is no strategic interaction.\nProposition 3. Assume conditions (a)\u2013(e) and the notation in Theorem 1, and let bL > bN .\nIf r(y) is increasing in y, then bF > bL, so that in a game with strategic complements the\nfollower is better off than the leader. If r(y) is decreasing in y, then bF \u2264 bN , so that in a\ngame with strategic substitutes the follower is worse off than in the simultaneous game.\nProof. As in the proof Theorem 1, we can assume that a(r(y),y), which is equal to\nb(y,r(y)), is increasing in y, if necessary by reversing the order on both X and Y . This\ndoes not affect whether r:X \u2192 Y is increasing or decreasing.\nSuppose that r(y) is increasing in y. Then yL \u2264 yN implies r(yL) \u2264 r(yN) = yN and\ntherefore (3) which contradicts bL > bN . This excludes the first case in the proof of\nTheorem 1, so the second case yL > yN applies, where bF > bL.\nIf r(y) is decreasing in y, then yL \u2265 yN implies r(yL) \u2264 r(yN) = yN , which gives the\nsame contradiction, so that the first case yL < yN in the proof of Theorem 1 applies, that\nis, bF \u2264 bN .\n4 Symmetry and monotonicity are necessary\nTheorem 1 is stated in such a way that it still makes sense for non-symmetric games,\nnamely that player II prefers being follower to being leader (or is worse off than in the\nNash equilibrium), rather than just stating \u201cthe follower is better off than the leader\u201d.\nThe following example shows that the symmetry condition (e) is necessary. Consider\nthe game with x,y\u2265 0 and payoff functions\na(x,y) = x \u00b7 (4\n3\n+\n2\n3\ny\u2212 x),\nb(x,y) = y \u00b7 (4\n3\n+\n2\n3\nx\u2212 y)+4x\n(7)\nwhich has the (symmetric and linear) best reply functions r(y) = (2+ y)\/3 and s(x) =\n(2+ x)\/3. Moreover, a(x,y) is increasing in y and b(x,y) is increasing in x. The unique\nNash equilibrium is (1,1) with payoffs aN = 1 to player I and bN = 5 to player II.\n7\nWhen player I in (7) is a leader, the function a(x,s(x)) is maximized for xL = 8\/7 with\npayoff aL = a(xL,s(xL)) = 1+1\/63 to player I as leader and payoff bF = b(xL,s(xL)) =\n5+ 65\/147 to player II as follower. However, when player II is the leader, her function\nb(r(y),y) is maximized for yL = 2 with payoff bL = b(r(yL),yL) = 5+ 7\/9, and payoff\naF = a(r(yL),yL) = 1+ 7\/9 to player I as follower. Note that bL > bF > bN , so the\nconclusion of Theorem 1 does not apply. Here, player II prefers being a leader to being a\nfollower, whereas player I prefers following to leading. This agrees with Dowrick (1986,\np. 255, Proposition 2): \u201cIf both firms have upward-sloping reaction functions, then if one\nprefers to lead, the other must prefer to be the von Stackelberg follower.\u201d All assumptions\nby Dowrick are met in (7), writing (for y > 0) b(x,y) = y \u00b7 (4\/3+2x\/3+4x\/y\u2212y) where\nthe second factor has negative derivative with respect to y and positive derivative with\nrespect to x. Dowrick (1986, p. 257, Proposition 3) notes that both firms prefer to be\nfollowers when they \u201cface similar cost and demand structures\u201d, which however is not\nmade precise. Boyer and Moreaux (1987) quantify this distinction in terms of the \u201ccost\ndifferential\u201d between the firms, for a specific payoff function.\nWithout the monotonicity condition (c), it may happen that bL > bF > bN , even when\nthe game is symmetric. Consider the symmetric game with x,y\u2265 0 and payoff\na(x,y) = b(y,x) = (0.72x\u22120.125y\u22120.785)(6.16\u2212 y\u22120.72x) (8)\nwhich has the (linear) best reply function\nr(y) = max(\n1389\u2212175y\n288\n, 0)\u2248max(4.823\u22120.608y, 0).\nThe unique Nash equilibrium is (xN ,yN) = (3,3) and has payoff bN = b(3,3) = 1. The\nleader payoff is bL = aL = a(xL,s(xL))\u2248 a(6.822,0.678)\u2248 2.306 and the follower payoff\nis bF = b(xL,s(xL)) \u2248 1.322, with bL > bF > bN . Here, a(r(y),y) = ((43\u2212 9y)\/16)2 as\nlong as r(y) > 0, that is, y < 7.937. This function is not monotonic, but has a minimum\nfor y = 43\/9\u2248 4.778.\nThe function in the example (8) does not make too much sense from an economic\nviewpoint since the follower payoff bF is obtained as a product of two negative terms (un-\nlike the payoff in the Nash equilibrium), which is crucial for this particular construction.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author thanks Martin Dufwenberg, Attila Tasna\u00b4di, Shmuel Zamir, and a referee for\nhelpful comments and discussions.\n8\nReferences\nAmir, R.
