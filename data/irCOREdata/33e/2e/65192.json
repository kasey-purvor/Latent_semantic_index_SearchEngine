INTRODUCTION \nPeople often take too long to recognize that their expectations are being violated and that \na problem is growing more severe.... Managing the unexpected often occurs in the \nearliest stages, when the unexpected may give off only weak signals. (Weick & Sutcliff \n2001, pp. 2\u20134) \nThe problem is that \u2017weak signals\u2018 very often don\u2018t attract the attention of decision makers as \nbeing the potential precursors of possible extreme outcomes, whether they are deemed to be \ngood or bad. Mostly they simply aren\u2018t seen, or if seen, aren\u2018t paid attention to. Opposite the \ndominant fear of bias from theory ladenness (Kuhn, 1962; Churchland, 1979; Franklin et al., \n1989; Guba & Lincoln, 1994), we pick up on the idea that it is quite often the case that \u2017you \ndon\u2019t see what you aren\u2019t looking for\u2018, which stems from cognitive blindness (Simons & \nChabris, 1999, Simons & Rensink, 2005; Simons et al., 2005).  \nWhat Weick and Sutcliffe call \u2017weak signals\u2018 in their book, Managing the Unexpected (2001) \nHolland (2002) refers to as tiny initiating events (TIEs).\n1\n TIEs often first appear as random, \nseemingly meaningless events that are easy to overlook or even ignore; and yet they can spiral up \ninto extreme events of disaster proportions. A key crisis management question, then, is: How to \naccentuate the discovery of TIES and learn how diminish their effect \u2013 manage them away \u2013 so \nthat they do not promulgate major crises? \nWeick and Sutcliff (2001) examine the manner in which \u2017high-reliability organizations\u2018 such \nas air traffic control systems, aircraft carriers, nuclear power plants and hospital emergency \nfacilities have learned to pay more attention to Holland\u2018s  (TIEs) in the control of risk.2 Needless \nto say, TIEs are invariably seen in retrospective analyses of why disasters occur. For example, \n                                                 \n1\n His actual phrasing is \u2017small \u2015inexpensive\u2016 inputs cause major directed effects in cas dynamics\u2018 (2002, p. 29). \n2\n Note that we could just as easily substitute Turner\u2018s (1976) \u2017incubation\u2019 for Holland\u2018s \u2017initiating\u2019 events in the \nacronym, TIEs; either term is appropriate for us.  \n2 \n \nbefore 9\/11, the FBI was more or less aware of 52 seemingly random and not easily explained \nevents that were ignored, even though the whistleblower, Coleen Rowley, wrote a paper for FBI \nDirector, Robert Mueller, criticizing the agency for ignoring crucial evidence about jihadi \ntraining activities and describing failures at one Field Office that had acquired information about \na specific Al Qa'ida terrorist, Zacarias Moussaoui, and actually had taken him into custody on \nAugust 15, 2001 (Rowley, 2002). Most of the TIEs that spiralled up to cause the total failure of \nthe Union Pacific railroad (UP) after its merger with the Southern Pacific railroad (SP) had \nalready been observed causing slowdowns on the SP before the merger \u2013 but the UP ignored \nthem until too late. All of the early causes that finally spiralled up into the bank-liquidity induced \nworldwide recession were all identifiable early on by some people (Cooper, 2008; Morris, 2008), \nand even bet against by John Paulson and George Soros \u2013 who sold short and thereby made \n~$6.9billions on the crashing stock markets just between the two of them! (Anderson, 2008).  \nOur focus in this article is to help managers avoid cognitive blindness in order to see TIES \nmore clearly and much earlier so they can shut them down before an extreme event occurs. The \ncrisis management literature defines crises as incubating (Turner, 1976) or smouldering (Smith \n& Millar, 2002) inside firms, that they begin with small internal events (Lester & King, 2006), \nand that 80% of these are human related (Mitroff, et al., 1996). We wish to separate out and put \nour attention on incubation-TIEs that managers might actually recognize and manage before they \nbecome disasters (e.g., see Mitroff, 2000; Barton, 2001; Oren, 2001; Weick & Sutcliffe, 2001). \nWe emphasize authors who focus on the early TIE-recognition process and who discuss various \nexamples of TIEs \u2013 events that do actually scale up into extreme outcomes. Given this, we take \nthe view that if managers became more familiar with \u2017scale-free theories\u2018 they would better and \nsooner be able to see possible scale-free causal developments spiralling into extreme outcomes. \n3 \n \nWhat are scale-free theories? These point to TIEs and subsequent developments in firms that \ncould scale up into extreme events. They help managers recognize TIEs earlier rather than when \nit is too late. We draw from complexity science to explain what scale-free theories are. Andriani \nand McKelvey (2009) describe fifteen theories showing different ways TIEs can scale up into \ndisasters; we discuss five of these in detail, using specific examples from a now classic business \ncase \u2013 the disaster occurring after the merger of the Union Pacific (UP) and Southern Pacific \n(SP) railroads in the U.S. \u2013 to illustrate how each scale-free theory helps managers see emergent \nTIEs, and then \u2017manage\u2018 them into irrelevance before they spiral into crises. \nWe begin with a short review of the basic elements of complexity science that are most \nrelevant to understanding what kinds of incubation TIEs are apt to scale up into extremes. We \ndon\u2018t describe the various scale-free theories until later in the merger-case description when we \ncan connect each theory to TIEs in the merger situation. Next, we give a short history of the \nUP\/SP merger, showing how TIEs apply to the situation and ending with reference to Langer\u2018s \n(1989) concept of mindfulness, which was brought into the management literature by Weick et \nal. (1999). Then we detail the several scale-free theories that we argue help managers look for \nand see the relevant incubation TIEs; we first describe each scale-free theory and then show its \nrelevance in explaining various TIE spirals in the merger case.  \nII. BACKGROUND \nThe veteran crisis management researcher, Ian Mitroff, defines a major crisis as follows: \nA crisis is an event that affects or has the potential to affect the whole of an \norganization\u2026. It must exact a major toll on human lives, property, financial earnings, \nthe reputation, and the general health and well-being of an organization\u2026. More often \nthan not\u2026a major crisis is something that \u2017cannot be completely contained within the \nwalls of an organization\u2018. (Mitroff, 2000, pp. 34\u201335)  \n4 \n \nCoombs (1999) says that \u2017a crisis is a major, unpredictable event that threatens to harm an \norganization and its stakeholders. Although crisis events are unpredictable, they are not \nunexpected\u2018. Mitroff also notes that \u2017major crises occur not only because of what an organization \nknows, anticipates, and plans for, but just as much because of what it does not know and does \nnot anticipate\u2018 (2000, p. 35). Different hazards pose different but always unexpected risks \n(Wisner, et al., 2004). Emergency management aims to avoid risks (Haddow & Bullock, 2004). \nRisk mitigation aims to prevent hazards from developing into disasters or reduce their \nconsequences. Smith (2008) defines a crisis as \u2017an event, or series of events, that exceeds, or \ncomes close to exceeding, an organisation\u2018s abilities to cope with the task demands of the event. \nMany crises, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, explosions, falling cranes and bridges, floods, \nand forest fires are not predictable as to specific timing or impact. While in general we know that \nthere are more fires in dry seasons, avalanche disasters are more likely in the Alps, hurricanes are \nmore apt to hit Florida, and earthquakes more likely in California and Turkey, we can\u2018t yet \npredict specific time and place. These are referred to as \u2017sudden onset\u2018 crises.  \nIn his now classic paper, Turner (1976) focuses on the \u2017incubation phase\u2018 of a smouldering \ncrisis, that is, the early stage when \u2017\u2026a chain of discrepant events develop and accumulate \nunnoticed\u2018 (p. 381; our italics). He finds several similarities across three disasters in mining, rail \ncrossing, and a holiday leisure building: rigidities in perception, attention to known problems \ndecoys people away from new incubations, disregard of information from outsiders, and \ninformation obscurities. Reason (1990) calls incubation events \u2017pathogens\u2018 \u2013 \u2017minor causes, \nmisperceptions, misunderstandings and miscommunications\u2018 \u2013 smouldering in obscurity until a \n\u2017trigger event\u2018 leads to escalation (Smith, 2002). Perrow (1984, p. 106) observes that disasters \nare more likely to occur when the pathogens (TIEs) are \u2017tightly coupled\u2018, with complex \n5 \n \ninteractions leading to a \u2017significant degree of incomprehensibility\u2018. Radell (1992) refers to what \nthe Russians called \u2017storming\u2018 \u2013 which occurs when management speeds up production (trying to \nset a production record  at the Wilberg coal mine) or sets up an aggressive schedule (Chernobyl \n& Three Mile Island).  \nTurner (1994) blames \u2017sloppy management\u2018 for most of what happens in the incubation \nperiod, as does Smith (2006a). ICM (2008) reports that 80% of crises are internal to firms, \ncaused by management and workers. Using Reason\u2018s \u2017Swiss cheese\u2018 model, Smith (2006b) puts \nall of the pathogens in Turner\u2018s incubation phase into his own Swiss cheese management \npractice model, referring to them as \u2017pathways of vulnerability\u2018. He notes that the critical \nelements most likely to foster a progression toward a crisis tipping point are nonlinear dynamics, \nlittle forceful evidence calling for change, and increasing interconnections within and among \norganizations around the world.  \nOther crises are defined as \u2017smouldering crises\u2018. ICM (2008) reports that since 1990, some \n65% of crises reported in the media are of the smouldering kind. Among many others, Lester and \nKing (2006, p. 3) say, \u2017smouldering crises begin as small, internal problems that, because of a \nlack of appropriate managerial attention, become large, public problems\u2018. Smouldering crises are \ntypically \u2017human-caused crises\u2018 stemming from \u2017defects within the larger organization or \nsystem\u2018 (Mitroff, Pearson, & Harrington, 1996, p. 43). Human-caused crises tend to \u2017leave a trail \nof early-warning signals\u2018 (Lester & King, p. 3; our italics). The analyses of what caused the \nChallenger and Columbia space-shuttle failures show a number of seemingly trivial early-\nwarnings by employees that were ignored until the disasters were triggered by random external \nevents \u2013 the Challenger\u2018s launch in freezing weather and the large piece of launch debris that \ndamaged the insulation material on the Columbia \u2013 which showed up on its final re-entry into \n6 \n \nEarth\u2018s atmosphere (Rogers, 1986; CAIB, 2003).  \nWe believe it is important to clearly distinguish between incubation and smouldering \u2013 it is \neasy to see overlap in the definitions. We try to clarify as follows:  \n Incubation: As we quote Turner above, incubation is defined as \u2017a chain of discrepant events [that] \ndevelop and accumulate unnoticed\u2018. Here it is the incubation-TIEs that eventually scale up to cause \nthe disaster. They are, indeed, the causal events that, left unfettered, spiral up to extreme proportions. \nThe 9\/11 disaster is a good example of incubation ignored; the early clues were about terrorist TIEs \nthat were ignored long enough that the terrorists could finally organize to produce the disaster. Weick \nand Sutcliffe (2001) focus on incubation events in the high-reliability organizations they study. Their \ndetailing of the total collapse of the UP after its merger with the SP is a classic example of incubation \nTIEs that were well known before the merger but were ignored. We will detail this progression later.  \n Smouldering: These are \u2017accidents waiting to happen\u2018. Some \u2017early warning\u2018 clues may exist but they \nare ignored. But the clues, per se, don\u2018t spiral up to cause a disaster. As was the case with the \nChallenger disaster, there were clues offered that freezing weather might cause a problem with the \nseals, but nothing was done and nothing happened until the first early-morning launch in below-\nfreezing temperatures, which caused the seals to shrink and become brittle. In this case TIEs are in the \nform of clues that could spiral up to gain management\u2018s attention, but bureaucracy suppresses them \u2013 \nthey do not spiral up to cause disasters. The problem here is not that early warning clues spiral up to \ncause an extreme outcome; the disaster happens because the early clues don\u2019t spiral up to get \nmanagement\u2018s attention. Perrow\u2018s \u2017normal accidents\u2018 fit here; the clues were not seen or were ignored; \nthe connectivity that occurred at some point was the \u2017random\u2018 triggering event. \nWhile crisis management is only concerned with TIEs scaling up to negative outcomes, we \nrecognize that managers would also like to discover early on and then enable TIEs that could \nscale up into positive extremes like Microsoft, Wal-Mart or Google. There is risk in bad things \nhappening and in good things not happening. Here, however, we focus only on the former. The \nmanagement problem is: How to transform TIEs into TIE \u2018levers\u2019 (Holland, 2002) \u2013 that is, \nactions that may be used to stop bad TIEs from spiralling into negative extreme events.\n3\n  \n                                                 \n3\n Elsewhere we focus on how to use TIEs and scale-free theory for better managing toward positive extremes \n(Andriani & McKelvey, 2009) \n7 \n \nWe focus on incubation-TIEs that are embedded in the human causes of incubation events \u2013 \npeople, workers vs. managers, corporate and disciplinary silos and hierarchies (Turner, 1976, \n1994; Mitroff et al. (1996), self-protection (Mars & Frosdick, 1997; Vaughan, 1997), human \ntendencies toward bounded rationality (Simon, 1957), groupthink (Janis, 1972), or more \ngenerally, cognitive, organizational, and political motivations (Bazerman & Watkins, 2004) and \nnetworks (Newman, 2003; Newman et al., 2006).  \nIII. CAUSES OF SCALABILITY: A COMPLEXITY SCIENCE VIEW \nAs noted at the outset, academics (Franklin et al., 1989; Guba and Lincoln, 1994) and \nphilosophers of science (Kuhn, 1962), mostly worry about researchers so blinded by their \ntheories\/beliefs that they often see and report what is not really there \u2013 classic cases being the \nFrench discovery of \u2017N waves\u2018 (Klotz, 1980; Nye, 1980), \u2017water memory\u2018 (Maddox et al., 1988), \nand Fleischmann and Pons\u2018s (1989) reporting of their cold-fusion results. To help managers \nbetter see what they really aren\u2018t wanting to pay attention to \u2013 i.e., TIEs \u2013 we begin our analysis \nby defining \u2017scale-free theories\u2018 that serve as ways of sharpening managers\u2018 abilities to see TIES \nearly on. These are theories about how TIEs scale up into extreme positive or negative outcomes.  \nWe begin with scalability, then discuss power-law indicators, and then briefly review some \nunderlying complexity science discoveries. Learning more about these underlying causal \nprocesses paves the way toward seeing TIEs sooner and before they scale up into extreme \nnegative outcomes. Scalability is usually indicated by power laws and results from self-\norganization. \nScalability. Consider a cauliflower. Cut off a \u2017floret;\u2018 then cut a smaller floret from the first; \nthen keep cutting off successively smaller florets in this way. Each subcomponent is smaller than \n8 \n \nthe former, but each exhibits the same shape, structure, and genesis. The cauliflower evolved to \nthis state because it is governed by Galileo\u2018s \u2017square-cube law\u2018 of surface-to-volume ratio, the \nbiological basis of its survival and adaptation, i.e., the surface entities have to keep subdividing \nto keep surface area at the same ratio as volume increases. Following Haire (1959), Stephan \n(1983) applies the square-cube law to firm effectiveness. Employees bringing resources (sales, \nnew ideas & technology) in from outside the firm are \u2017surface\u2018 employees. \u2017Volume\u2018 employees \nare those inside who produce and coordinate. As firms grow, maintaining the square-cube ratio \nrequires adding more surface units or making volume units more efficient. A firm adopting \nSimon\u2018s (1962) architecture of complexity theory \u2013 which is also scale-free \u2013 would apply his \n\u2017near decomposability\u2018 rule at all levels \u2013 from bottom to top. Jack Welsh achieved this with his \n\u2017Be No. 1 or No. 2 in your industry or else\u2026\u2018 rule (Tichy & Sherman, 1994, p. 108; somewhat \nparaphrased), by injecting adaptive tension (McKelvey, 2008) at all levels. These are \norganizational examples of Mandelbrot\u2018s scale-free Fractal Geometry (1982).4 \nFractals often appear as the result of mathematical equations.\n5\n The cauliflower is different; it \nis an example of a fractal in nature that results from adaptive Darwinian natural-selection \nprocesses (Iannaccone & Khokha, 1996; West et al., 1997). We focus on the latter. Inside bodies, \nas a result of evolutionary processes, we see fractal structures in DNA base chemicals, genetic \ncircuitry, protein-protean interactions, cell metabolism, and bronchial structure, and so on (see \nAndriani & McKelvey, 2007, for examples and citations). Many fractal structures in biology are \ndue to predator\/prey dynamics; McKelvey et al. (2009) cite nineteen examples. \nWhy do fractal structures occur? The mathematical equation is the same at multiple levels of a \n                                                 \n4\n Fractals are defined as shapes that can be subdivided into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a \nreduced-size copy of the whole (Mandelbrot, 1982). The same mathematical equation \u2013 or adaptive causal dynamic \nin biology or in organizations \u2013 creates similar causal dynamics at each level of a fractal structure. \n5\n Rather than take up space to illustrate math-based and nature-based fractals, we suggest clicking on the \nfollowing URL: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fractal   It is informative and picturesque. \n9 \n \nmath-created fractal; the adaptive response of a biological agent depends on the same causes \noperating at multiple levels of a bio-fractal. Even though the cause is the same at multiple levels, \nhowever, the consequence can be nonlinear; that is, nonlinear outcomes resulting when a single \nevent out of myriad very small events gets amplified \u2013 e.g., by positive feedback \u2013 to generate an \nextreme effect extending across multiple levels. These nonlinear dynamics are explained by \nscale-free theories.  \nScale-free theories explain why we see fractal structures and long-tailed, Pareto-distributed \nphenomena within firms and within organizational populations and ecosystems (West & \nDeering, 1995; Newman, 2005; Andriani & McKelvey, 2009). Fractal structures emerge \nbecause, as in the cauliflower, the same cause applies at multiple levels. While incubation-TIEs \nare required as initiating events, disasters only happen if they scale up in size or consequence \u2013 \ni.e., spread throughout a large and essential department or scale up or down to affect other \nhierarchical levels in a firm. These theories apply when the same causes operate at multiple \nlevels to yield what Gell-Mann (1988, p. 3) labels \u2017deep simplicity\u2018 \u2013 a single theory explaining \ndynamics at multiple levels. Scale-free theories point to a single generative cause to explain the \ndynamics at each of however many levels are being studied;  \nPower Laws. A Pareto rank\/frequency distribution \u2013 e.g., a distribution of cities and towns \nranging from thousands of small villages in one long tail on the Y-axis to the single largest city \n(London in the UK; New York in the U.S.) at the end of the other tail on the X-axis \u2013 plotted in \nterms of double-log scales appears as a power law, which is an inverse sloping straight line (Zipf, \n1949; Andriani & McKelvey, 2007). Power laws often take the form of rank\/size expressions \nsuch as F ~ N\n \u2013\u03b2\n, where F is frequency, N is rank (the variable) and \u03b2, the exponent, is constant. \nIn most \u2017exponential\u2018 functions, e.g., p(y) ~ e(ax), the exponent is the variable and e (Euler \n10 \n \nnumber) is constant. Power laws are increasingly discovered in social and organizational \nphenomena. The size of firms follows a power law (Stanley et al., 1996; Axtell, 2001). Brock \n(2000) says power laws are the fundamental feature of the Santa Fe Institute\u2018s approach to \ncomplexity science. Gell-Mann (2002) follows this up by saying that complexity phenomena \nsuch as scalability and power laws are just as important for scientific study as are physicists\u2018 \ntraditional axiomatic based, law-like phenomena, and more importantly for us, are even more \nimportant in the study of living systems. \nSpecifically, the extreme outcome at one end of the Pareto rank\/frequency distribution is \ntypically an N = 1 extreme event \u2013 a No. 9 quake on the Richter Scale; a world-wide pandemic \nlike the Black Plague; the Challenger disaster; or Microsoft and Wal-Mart. At the opposite end \nthe N can run into the millions and more \u2013 think of all the Ma&Pa stores.6 The mean, mode, and \nmedian do not overlap, as they do in a normal distribution. Methods of good management at one \nextreme do not apply to the opposite extreme \u2013 managing a Ma&Pa store is not the same as \nmanaging Wal-Mart. As Axtell (2008) points out, \u2017the typical firm does not exist\u2018. Managing the \nmedian firm is not the same as managing at either extreme. Our interest here, however, is how \nevents in the \u2017micro\u2018 tail sometimes scale up to the extreme in the opposite tail. \nWe argue that the power law discoveries discussed above apply to management and \norganizations, especially since they are good indicators of fractal structures and scalability in \naction and, consequently, underlying Pareto distributions (Andriani & McKelvey, 2007, 2009; \nBoisot & McKelvey, 2007). There is good reason to believe that power-law effects are also \nubiquitous in organizations and have far greater consequences than current management theories \npresume. As noted above, fractal phenomena in bodies (fish, birds, mammals) (as indicated by \n                                                 \n6\n In the U.S. these are defined as sole proprietor (or husband & wife run) stores that do not have paid employees. \nThere are 17 million of them in the U.S.  \n11 \n \npower laws) are essential to life and survival in predator\/prey ecologies (McKelvey et al., 2009). \nIn organizations we see power laws that indicate entrepreneurship (Poole et al., 2000), alliance \nnetworks (Barab\u00e1si & Bonabeau, 2003), bankruptcies (Fujiwara, 2004), biotech networks \n(Powell et al., 2005), industry growth (Ishikawa, 2006), economic change (Podobnik et al., \n2006), product development (Braha & Bar-Yam, 2007) and M&A waves (Park, 2008). \nUnderlying all of these examples are tension, connectivity, and TIEs that do, in fact, scale up to \nform Pareto distributions and power laws. Elsewhere, we list 86 kinds of power law findings in \nsocio-organizational phenomena (Andriani & McKelvey, 2009). \nThe foregoing are all based on after-the-fact data analyses, and they are all power-law \nevidence of constructive kinds of scalability, fractals, and Pareto distributions. For these, \nHolland\u2018s (2002) TIE \u2017levers\u2018 are critically important. TIE levers are tiny initiating\/incubation \nevents that, by using appropriate scalability levers, managers can \u2017lever\u2018 behaviour in their firms \nup into dramatic positive Pareto distributions and positive extreme outcomes \u2013 like Microsoft, \nWal-Mart, and Google. Oppositely, in firms like Parmalot, Enron, Northern Rock, or Lehman \nBrothers, the beginnings of \u2017could-become\u2018 power law distributions that stem from negative \nTIEs are what managers really want to avoid. This means that managers have to get into the \nbusiness of checking all sorts of organizational data and distributions to see if they are negative \nphenomena beginning to show signs of what could become power laws. If so, managers would \nwant to hammer these power laws and the TIEs that started them back into oblivion. \nTension. Self-organization in complex systems typically appears in the \u2017region of emergence\u2018 \nbetween the \u2017edge of order\u2018 and the \u2017edge of chaos\u2018, often termed the 1st and 2nd critical values of \nimposed energy or tension (Stauffer, 1987; Kauffman, 1993). We discuss each next: \nEdge of order. Prigogine (1955) built on B\u00e9nard\u2018s (1901) study of emergent structures in \n12 \n \nfluids. In a teapot, for example, the \u2017rolling boil\u2018 familiar to chefs describes a phase transition \nfrom molecules dissipating heat by vibrating faster in place to molecules circulating around the \npot, thereby speeding up heat transfer. Because these emergent structures serve to dissipate \nenergy imposing on a system from outside, he labelled them \u2017dissipative structures\u2018. This phase \ntransition\u2014which occurs at the so-called \u20171st critical value\u2018 of imposed energy (what McKelvey, \n2008) calls \u2017adaptive tension\u2018)\u2014defines \u2017the edge of order\u2019. This theory of phase transitions \nstems from physics (Prigogine, 1955; Haken, 1977; Nicolis & Prigogine, 1989; Mainzer, \n1994\/2007). As systems tip across the edge of order we see phase transitions in which new kinds \nof order (structure and process) emerge. Because of the bank-liquidity crisis first appearing in \n2007 and because of the following world-wide recession (2008\u20132010), we now see the economic \ntension imposed by the liquidity crisis creating a world-wide phase transition in how \ngovernments are responding to bail out banks, and in the future work toward a new world-wide \nbank-regulation process. The free-market thinking of \u2017Reaganomics\u2018, which led to the repeal of \nthe Glass-Steagall Act (created in 1933 to prevent banks from risking depositors money) in 1999 \n(Kauffman, 2008), is now being replaced by a more Keynesian-based approach with more \ngovernment controls over bank risk-taking and use of high leverage (Soros, 2008; Pollin, 2009) \nEdge of chaos. Scientists at the Santa Fe Institute focus mostly on living systems and how \nheterogeneous agents interact and self-organize at the \u2017edge of chaos\u2018 so as to create new kinds \nof order (Gell-Mann, 1988; Holland, 1988, 1995; Arthur, 1993; and Kauffman, 1993). Between \nthe \u2017edges\u2018 of order and chaos lies a region of emergent complexity, sometimes called the \n\u2017melting zone\u2018 of maximum adaptive capability (Stauffer, 1987; Kauffman, 1993). Bak (1996) \nargued that to survive, entities maintain themselves in a state of \u2017self-organized criticality\u2018 \n13 \n \n(defined in Table 1) near the \u2017edge of chaos\u2019 (Lewin, 1992; Kauffman, 1993).7 The signifiers of \nthe melting zone are self-organization, emergence and nonlinearity. Self-organization occurs \nwhen heterogeneous agents in search of improved fitness interconnect under conditions of \nexogenously or endogenously imposed adaptive tension. New order is an emergent outcome of \nthe self-organizing process. \nThe fact that extreme events start from TIEs and then spiral up into macrophenomena\n8\n that are \norders of magnitude larger poses a problem: where do they acquire\/find the energy to do so? In a \nlinear world, such as the case with neoclassical economics and disciplines inspired by the \nequilibrium assumption, large-scale deviations from equilibrium (the normal state)\n9\n can only be \ngenerated by large-scale causes that act with the same scale on the effect, i.e., the outcome is a \nlinear function of the cause. Instead, in a nonlinear world, the potential of TIEs to cause \ntransformation on a scale completely different from their own has to be explained by a different \nprocess. For TIEs to unleash radical change, however, there have to be available \u2013 but often \ninvisible and unexploited \u2013 sources of energy. \u2017Incubation\u2018, whether physical, biological or \nhuman, requires energy inputs, otherwise nothing happens; there is no free lunch. \nA well-known example is hurricane formation. The several TIEs that combine to produce a \n                                                 \n7\n In a comprehensive review of self-organized criticality (SOC), Frigg (2003) observes that SOC appears in \nsystems existing in both stable and changing niches. It has also been shown that SOC very well explains punctuated \nequilibrium in evolving species (Paczuski et al., 1995; Boettcher & Paczuski, 1996). Needless to say, punctuated \nequilibrium, by definition, stems from the coming and going of changing and stable niches. \n8\n Cities like London and New York spiral up from the first tiny settlements hundreds of years ago. Honda in the \nU.S. spiraled up from their employees\u2018 use of 50cc motor bikes in Los Angeles (Pascale, 1984). Wal-Mart began as \na one-store operation by Sam Walton. Ford Motor Co. began as the Model T made on one assembly line. Many \npower law distributions show many small entities and also that many of them grow to medium and one extreme \noutcome. \n9\n While Eldredge and Gould (1972) were correct in their use of \u2017punctuated equilibrium\u2018 so as to account to the \ngaps in the fossil record, most of Darwinian selectionist evolution (and all the evidence we have that it is correct), \nactually takes place in stable ecologies lasting millions of years \u2013 like alpine meadows, the Sahara Desert, the \nBrazilian rainforest, the oceans, etc. The evolutionary changes we see are evolution toward equilibrium conditions in \nstable ecologies or contexts (Van de Vijver et al., 1998). \n14 \n \nhurricane are: (1) high temperature; (2) high water temperature; (3) humidity difference between \nthe surface of the ocean and the troposphere; (4) a small instability (TIE) that causes an upward \nlocal convective (circular) motion of warm air; (5) the rapid cooling that ensues as the air rises, \nwhich liberates further energy (latent heat of condensation); (6) additional air sucked into the \nTIE-caused initial circular motion that subjects more air to the phase transition of warm-to-cold \nair; and finally (7) enough stability in the forgoing conditions for the process to continue long \nenough for the hurricane to develop. In highly chaotic environments such spirals are impossible. \nThe 2007 bank-liquidity crisis shows analogous dynamics: (1) mortgage-backed securities are \ninvented and packaged; (2) \u2017derivatives\u2018 are invented as \u2017safe\u2018 investment formulas, which allow \nvery high leverages; (3) about $1 trillion Chinese foreign reserves flow into the U.S. bond \nmarket; (4) the Federal Reserve \u2017discount rate\u2018 plunges to 2% after the dotcom bust in 2002 and \nthen down to 1% in 2003; (5) people start using 5-year \u2017teaser\u2018 loans to buy houses at low \ninterest, with no requests from banks for credit reports or income statements; (6) the housing \nbubble starts in several countries; (7) the use of various financial engineering-based loan \nsecuritization and investment strategies develops; (8) banks leverage their deposits up to a 30\/1, \n40\/1, 50\/1 and even 100\/1 margins on loans made across the world; (9) the bubble starts to \ncollapse in the U.S. in January 2006; (10) the 5-year teaser loans begin to expire in late 2006 and \n2007; (11) home-mortgage defaults and foreclosures skyrocket in the U.S.; (12) U.S. banks \nexhibit liquidity crises leading to bankruptcies; and finally (13) the U.S. liquidity crisis spreads \nworld-wide. Any single element listed above may be insignificant in itself and uncorrelated with \nthe final outcome, but it may tap into latent uncertainty that lingers in the markets. Once the \nwave of selling\/buying starts locally, it feeds on itself and spreads like an epidemic (Dornbusch \net al., 2000; Boyson et al., 2008; Gallegati et al., 2008). In this case, the availability of available \n15 \n \nfunds (the energy gradient or force: in this case Chinese money in the U.S. bond market, the 1% \ndiscount rate, and very lax mortgage requirements)\n10\n were the pre-conditions energizing the start \nof the epidemic. \nSize of the melting zone. Complex systems exist in a state of dynamical balance in the melting \nzone (the region of emergence) between the 1\nst\n and 2\nnd\n critical values. Below the 1\nst\n, imposing \nforces push them toward stasis, integration, equilibrium and ultimately isolation from the \nenvironment and equilibrium. Above the 2\nnd\n, quickly changing imposing forces push them \ntoward chaos, frantic change, and ultimately disintegration. Sandwiched in the zone between \norder and chaos, systems show emergent complexity. However, the dynamics in the region of \nemergence when self-organization with respect to crisis management occurs are complicated. We \noutline some of these dynamics next: \n1. Chaos alters the size of the melting zone (between the 1st and 2nd critical values) as follows: \n\uf0fc Chaos imposing on a tension that would normally tip a system over the 1st critical value, disrupts the \nconsistency of the tension, thereby reducing its \u2017tipping\u2018 force; chaos makes it harder for a coherent energy \nforce to build up and stay consistent long enough to tip the system over the 1\nst\n critical value; \n\uf0fc Chaos imposing at the 2nd critical value increases the likelihood of a system tipping across the edge of chaos \nand into the region of chaos; more chaos makes it easier to tip across the edge of chaos \u2013in effect it lowers \nthe threshold; \n\uf0fc Consequently, chaos reduces the size of the melting zone. \n2. A reduction in the size of the melting zone has two countervailing effects: \n\uf0fc On the one hand, as the melting zone shrinks the likelihood that TIEs self-organize so as to scale up into \nextreme outcomes is reduced \u2013 with the result chaos reduces the likelihood of disasters; \n\uf0fc On the other hand, as the melting zone shrinks the likelihood of human activities self-organizing to see the \nnegative incubation-TIEs sooner, and self-organizing in ways that negate them are both reduced \u2013 with the \nresult that the probability of disaster mitigation is reduced. \n\uf0fc By this logic, chaos has no consistent effect in increasing or reducing the probability of extremes. \n3. But, a system\u2018s ability to tip across the 1st critical value is a function of both chaos and bureaucracy \n                                                 \n10\n The Glass-Steagall Act, which was made law in 1933 and which prevented normal banks from taking risky \ninvestments, was repealed in 1999 (Kauffman, 2008). The Bush Administration, starting in 2002, adopted a policy \nof relaxing mortgage loan standards so that more minorities could buy houses (Becker et al., 2008). Most of the \nmortgage defaults have been by minority homeowners.  \n16 \n \nbecause both inhibit tipping ability at the edge of order. The findings from many crisis studies are that \nbureaucratic effects inhibit emergent self-organization of TIEs aimed at negating disasters much more \nthan bureaucratic effects inhibit TIEs that scale up into disasters. Logically, if it were the other way \naround, incubation-type crises wouldn\u2018t happen. \nOf course, in principle, the build-up of imposing forces or energy gradients helping or \nhindering the self-organization of disaster-building TIEs or disaster-preventing TIEs can be \nmonitored. Weick\u2018s concept of mindfulness (Weick et al., 1999) can be co-opted for this purpose \nand can be used as an indicator of the resilience of the system and of the size (thickness) of the \nmelting zone. Mindfulness, then, can be bifurcated into seeing more quickly both kinds of TIEs \u2013 \ni.e., those apt to scale up into disasters and those that could be used as levers to negate the \nformer.  Constant attention has to be given to the level of the imposing energy gradient and the \nwidth of the melting zone. The larger the latter, the more robust a firm is against external events \nand forces impinging on it.   \nIV. TENSION, TIES & MINDFULNESS ON THE UNION PACIFIC \nOur objective for this section is to illustrate two key features of incubation crises: First, \nincubators usually are present in early stages of crises, as Turner (1976) points out; and second, \nthat the theory of TIES is considerably underdeveloped in the classic discussions of mindfulness \nby Weick and colleagues (Weick et al., 1999; Weick & Sutcliffe, 2001). We begin with the \nUP\/SP merger \u2013 described in detail by Weick and Sutcliffe \u2013 which offers a compelling example \nof how TIEs and their creation of minor crises were ignored by UP management during and after \nthe merger, with a major crisis the result. \nA. Merger-caused tensions on the Union Pacific \nThe passage of the Staggers Rail Act in 1980 led to the almost total deregulation of American \n17 \n \nrailroads. The number of railroads reduced from forty to ten and the over 100 year old Interstate \nCommerce Commission, set up in 1987 to negate rail monopolies, was decommissioned (Avery \n& Ericson, 2004). In 1995 the Surface Transportation Board [referred to as the Surf Board by all \nof the parties injured by the merger (Span, 2004)], approved the UP\/SP merger despite the \nobjections of the Federal Trade Commission; as well as the Justice, Transportation, and \nAgriculture Departments; rival railroads, numerous groups of customers, and especially coal \nshippers who could only use railroads. The UP\u2018s acquisition of the SP left the entire American \nWest serviced only by two giant railroads \u2013 the UP being the largest in the nation with 30,000+ \nmiles of track (Union Pacific, 2008).  \nEven before the merger, the risk of future operational problems was readily apparent. The SP \nhad a history of dysfunctional behaviour, bad operation and failures: First, the Marketing \nDepartment cut prices so as to overload the railroad so as to make the Production Department \nlook bad, thereby enhancing Marketing\u2018s chief\u2018s chances to become the CEO; second, despite \nincreased demand for shipping goods, too many cars were sitting unused because they were in \nthe wrong place at the wrong time, and high locomotive-lease costs and crew overtime ate up the \nvalue of the increased business (which was priced too low by Marketing); third, when customers \ncomplained, Marketing responded by cutting prices further, thereby compounding the rail traffic \nflow problems; fourth, most of the SP track (which was the primary route between the Los \nAngeles ship port and Houston), was single tracked, which meant trains could not pass each \nother, which then made it the primary source of congestion, delay, and increased customer \nshipping costs \u2013 all of which started the gridlock on the UP after the merger, and fifth, the SP \nvacillated between reducing double track and yards to reduce expenses vs. keeping the yards and \nadding double track to reduce congestion (Brennan & Norton, 1998; Burke, 1998; Avery & \n18 \n \nEricson, 2004; Span, 2004). \nDespite the already well-known congestion problems and train-movement failures on the SP \nbefore the merger, a requirement of the Surf Board\u2019s approval was to make over 4000 miles of \nUP\/SP track available to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad (the only competing \nrailroad in the American West) which, needless to say, exacerbated the congestion and traffic \nmovement failure problems. In addition, the UP cut many SP jobs outright and then closed the \nSP headquarters which meant SP operations employees familiar with SP congestion and had tacit \nknowledge about quick remedies left the company (and, they didn\u2018t want to move from trendy \nSan Francisco to the cornfields around Omaha, Nebraska). When remaining SP employees, who \nknew about the long history of gridlock on the SP, told their new UP bosses about the SP \nproblems and solutions that worked, they were ignored. In their book, Weick and Sutcliffe make \nspecial mention of the arrogance of UP managers toward \u2015expendable\u2016 former SP employees. \nThe UP\/SP merger took place in July 1996. UP claimed it would save $627 million. In fact, \n\u2017by March 1998 delays in shipments had cost rail customers approximately $1 billion in curtailed \nproduction, reduced sales, and higher shipping costs\u2018 (Union Pacific, 2008). The UP was allowed \nto use BNSF tracks to avoid further congestion in Texas. And as we note below, there were \naccidents and people killed. Ironically, even though the extreme negative outcomes of TIEs on \nthe SP were already evident, UP management\u2018s arrogance prevented them from seeing them. \nPretty much the same TIEs on the post-merger UP led to an even worse outcome: total gridlock \noccurring in October, 1997 (Frailey, 1998). Needless to say, arrogance and groupthink (Janis, \n1972) have to be pretty strong for such obvious knowledge of TIEs not to prevail! \nB. Holland\u2019s TIEs that bind on the UP after the merger \nTo begin, we highlight some of the TIEs on the UP that Weick and Sutcliffe describe (2001, pp. \n19 \n \n4\u201310) in Table 1 below. Here we try to mention only incidents that are at the level of initial clues \n\u2013 they are seemingly random events that are essentially trivial and occur now and then under \nnormal circumstances; these are initial clues \u2013 meaning that they are TIEs that show no evidence \nof scaling effects at this time; there are no obvious reasons to assume scalability at this point in \ntime in terms of any of the scalability theories we describe below. BUT, they are all clues that \nthings are not going well on the railroad. Incubation is close at hand.  \n>>>Insert Table 1 about here<<< \nThe foregoing are examples of Holland\u2018s \u2017tiny initiating events\u2018 (TIEs) \u2013 nothing more. In \nTable 2 we now paraphrase a number of higher-impact events that are set off by these TIEs. \nThese are evidence of scalability. For example:  \n\uf0fc Cuts in personnel, crew fatigue and on duty too long scales up due to stalled trains and clogged \nsidings; \n\uf0fc Poor engine maintenance and tired crews going off the clock scales up as unavailable locomotives and \ntrains stuck on sidings; \n\uf0fc Not enough locomotives and trains stuck on sidings scales up to trains backed up in clogged yards; \n\uf0fc No crews, no locomotives, trains stuck on sidings and yards led to total system gridlock. \n>>>Insert Table 2 about here<<< \nThe small events spiralled up into scalable events that eventually led to system-wide gridlock \n\u2013 the ultimate extreme outcome. None of these events could result from a single isolated TIE \nsuch as those we mention in Table 1. The latter have to scale up via some causal process such \nthat they have broader impact. We will detail this process in Section V. \nHaving described what we have reduced to brief descriptions in the foregoing tables, Weick \nand Sutcliffe then describe some of UP\u2018s managerial response. We paraphrase these in Table 3. \nNeedless to say, the list of management failures gives obvious reason to conclude that UP \nmanagement\u2018s style made them truly un-mindful. They rather obviously didn\u2019t see what they \n20 \n \nweren\u2019t looking for; they didn\u2018t see all of the TIEs that were present and that they really should \nhave been paying attention to. They could have prevented the disaster if they had been more \nsavvy about how their railroad disaster was indeed the result of TIEs that bind. \n>>>Insert Table 3 about here<<< \nC. Weick\u2019s approach to managerial responses: Mindfulness to pick up on TIEs \nWeick and Sutcliffe\u2018s identifications of UP management\u2018s failures would appear to provide an \naccurate description of events and, in fact, could be broadly applied to almost any kind of \norganizational failure that is seemingly due to management failures. By this we suggest that \nmany of the \u2017mindfulness\u2018 solutions they wish to apply rather narrowly to high-reliability \norganizations \u2013 specifically to negating TIEs early on so as to prevent them from scaling up into \nextremes \u2013 don\u2018t seem much differentiated from causes attributed to management failures in \ngeneral. However, they do mention:  \n \u2017Early and ample signs that the UP did not understand\u2026\u2018 (p. 8), and failures to detect that allow \n\u2017\u2026unexpected events to spin out of control\u2018. (p. 9)  \n They suggest that managers need to \u2017\u2026treat any lapse as a symptom that something is wrong\u2026that \ncould have severe consequences if separate small errors happen to coincide at one awful \nmoment\u2026\u2018. (p. 10)  \n They say \u2017resilience is a combination of keeping errors small\u2026\u2018. (p. 14)  \nAlso, extreme mindfulness can lead to organizations that are in a permanent state of \nfibrillation and overreact to even minor stimuli, in other words to \u2017hypochondriac\u2018 organizations. \nHypochondriac organizations pay excessive attention to tiny signals and live in a constant state \nof fear. In this case, mindfulness may lead to fragility rather than resilience. The distinction \nbetween inconsequential stimuli (that can be ignored) and TIEs (that have the potential of \nspiralling up) should be attended to on the basis of evident scale-free theories, as we argue in this \npaper.  Management scholars always worry about case writers who are \u2017theory laden\u2018 \u2013 they see \n21 \n \nwhat their theories tell them to look for (Kuhn, 1962; Franklin et al., 1989; Guba and Lincoln, \n1994). But the opposite may be true as well: One doesn\u2019t see what one isn\u2019t looking for. For us, \nscalability dynamics and their causes are what one may not see unless one is better trained to see \nthem. Elsewhere (Andriani and McKelvey, 2009) we describe fifteen theories about why \nscalability dynamics occur. In Section V we describe five of the fifteen that most readily explain \nthe various scaling dynamics that Weick and Sutcliffe (2001) describe. If management had been \nmore clued in about how the events we describe in Table 1 scale up into the events we mention \nin Table 2 the disaster wouldn\u2018t have happened. \n>>>Insert Table 4 about here<<< \nV. USING SCALABILITY TO SEE TIES SOONER: THE UP EXAMPLE \nSince we have a good example of TIEs scaling up into the total gridlock of the U.P. railroad \nacross an area about 1000 miles north-to-south and 2000 miles east-to-west we start by \ndescribing how several scalability theories apply to organizations in general. We follow each \ngeneral description with what happened on the U.P. railroad.  \nSquare-cube-quarter-power law: In biology, many scaling laws take the allometric\n11\n form Y \n~ M \nb\n, where Y is some observable and M the mass of the organism. Among these, West, Brown, \n& Enquist (1997) cite metabolic rate, height of trees, life span, growth rate, heart rate, DNA \nnucleotide substitution rate, lengths of aortas, size of genomes, mass of cerebral grey matter, \ndensity of mitochondria, etc. In general the exponent b is a multiple of \u00b1\u00bc. The square-cube law \napplies to the ratio of volume to surface \u2013 surface units keep subdividing to stay in constant ratio \nas volume increases. The \u2017\u00bc power law\u2018 stems from fluid flow: volume sets the energy use rate \n                                                 \n11\n Allometry refers to a type of growth in which the parts of an organism grow at a different rate. Therefore the \nproportions of the different parts changes during growth. \n22 \n \n(cube); surface sets the energy absorption rate (square); and the fluid flow rate between surface \nand volume is reflected in the \u00bc power ratio to square and cube. To achieve this, organisms have \ndeveloped common evolutionary mechanisms based on fractal geometry and fractal flow. We \nhave no direct evidence of this mechanism at work in organizations, but we note that the problem \nthe biologists have solved applies to organizations as well. Firms operate in competitive \necosystems  \u2013 with M&A activities acting as equivalents to predator\/prey fractal dynamics in \nbiological ecosystems \u2013 defined by the need to maximize revenues (exchange area between firm \nand customers) and minimize expenses (energy spent for developing, manufacturing and \ndistributing products). If this constraint on the revenue-energy relationship can be given a \nmeaningful geometric economic form, we may discover similar allometric relationships in \norganization science.  \nU.P. Application: This scalability law was brought into organization theory by Haire (1959). \nStephan (1983) translated it into \u2017surface\u2018 and \u2017volume\u2018 employees. Surface employees deal with \ncustomers and bring in business and revenues. Volume employees are those who administer and \nproduce products and services. In the UP, then, surface employees connect to customers; volume \nemployees fix tracks, sort trains in yards, dispatch and run trains, manage things, etc. The \u00bc \npower law, initially applied to blood flows in a body can also restrict surface or volume growth. \nHere, it applies to flows of trains and goods over the tracks. From the merger with SP , \ncustomers were about doubled; track length was roughly doubled \u2013 but train flows along any \nsingle track had to stay about the same. Just from knowing the surface-volume law, one can \neasily see that the railroad is immediately out of balance. Even though \u2017surface\u2018 was roughly \ndoubled, single-track flows remained unchanged. Worse, volume employees were cut when, in \nfact the square-cube law would call for increases in either efficiency or numbers at least in some \n23 \n \nplaces\/jobs. Knowing the surface-volume law, one could easily predict the extreme outcome and \nthen try to manage it away. \nCombination Theory: Here the only requirement for a power law to emerge is the number of \nelements in a complex system. This theory begins with Preston\u2018s (1981) \u2017diffonential\u2018, which he \nshows results when two exponential distributions are multiplied \u2013 the result is a lognormal. West \nand Deering (1995) and Newman (2005) both make the case for the simple addition of exponents \nin the basic power law equation, p(y) ~ e\na,b,c,d n\n. When this happens, exponentials and\/or \nlognormals in combination create a power law \u2013 the more of them that are combined the longer \nthe tail of the distribution and the more obvious the power law. In this theory, the likely \noccurrence of interaction is simply presumed as a naturally inherent likelihood as systems \nbecome more complex. If some number of the elements are individually likely to generate Pareto \ndistributions \u2013 as we argue in what follows \u2013 combination theory tells us that organizations are \ninevitably going to emerge as fractal structures unless there are explicit attempts by management \nto negate these \u2017natural\u2018 dynamics. \nU.P. Application: Normal distributions of different variables remain normally distributed if \nthey are combined (even becoming more normally distributed, in fact). But if somewhat skewed \ndistributions are combined (even just added together in terms of impact), they become more \nskewed. If several are combined, the result is a Pareto distribution. Let\u2018s suppose that before the \nmerger UP activities were normally distributed \u2013 mostly things worked as expected but with \nsome random deviations because of events like the flu or storms. Thus, normally, train crews are \non time; trains are on time; locomotives are at the right location on time; repair and dispatch \ncrews are on time; locomotives and crews and other railroaders function effectively most of the \ntime, etc. Then comes the merger. Now each of the foregoing normal distributions become \n24 \n \nskewed. Since there are several, and since they interact with combined effects, we see scalability \nwith the result that the entire system becomes gridlocked rather quickly. Because of the \ncumulative skewing, one could easily predict the extreme outcome and then try to manage \nagainst it. Worse, in this case there had already been visible combinations of disruptive events on \nthe SP that clearly shifted \u2017normal\u2018 railroad behaviour toward more skewed distributions. \nLeast effort: Zipf (1949) argued that \u2017least effort\u2018 explained his \u2017Zipf\u2018s Law\u2018 \u2013 a power law \nof word usage in English, French, and Spanish. To put it simply: Least effort means, I won\u2019t put \neffort into using words you are unfamiliar with; you won\u2019t put effort into learning words I don\u2019t \nuse. We each, therefore, save energy, become more efficient, and eventually use \u2017least effort\u2018. \nLeast-effort theory is about efficiency. Ferrer i Cancho and Sol\u00e9 (2003) use a computational \nmodel to confirm this. Least-effort theory is now shown to apply only under changing \ncircumstances. Dahui et al. (2005) test whether Zipf\u2018s Law applies to Chinese as well as English. \nInadvertently, they find something different \u2013 the power law signature applies only during the \nperiod before Emperor Qin Shihuang\u2018s unification when Chinese characters were changing. \nThey conclude that the law does not apply when the number of characters is stable. The \u2017change\u2018 \neffect is now confirmed, again inadvertently by Ishikawa (2005), who shows that Pareto\u2018s law \nholds in companies where there is higher rate of growth, but Gibrat\u2018s lognormal distribution \napplies to large firms where growth is slow. Dahui et al. (2006) show that the distribution of \nfirms in growth markets is a power law but in markets without growth it is Gamma or \nexponential. Finally, Podobnik et al. (2006) find empirically \u2013 and test further with a \ncomputational model \u2013 that time-series indices in transition economies (i.e., Hungary, Russia, \nSlovenia, etc.) fit Paretian rather than Gaussian distributions. The basic theory, readily applicable \nto organizations, is that efficient interactive transactions \u2013 like people talking to each other or \n25 \n \nbuying-selling \u2013 are Pareto distributed.  \nU.P. Application: To begin, UP and SP had different tacit, day-to-day, and on-the-job \nlanguages composed of in-house, local on-the-track and in-the-yards usages; even local, every-\nday \u2017management\u2018 word usages were somewhat different. When UP took over SP, UP language \nwas supposed to dominate. UP management wanted to take over SP without their UP language \nand behaviours changing; SP customs, language, and behaviours were to disappear. But, of \ncourse, they didn\u2018t and couldn\u2018t. Instead of seeing two organizational tacit and explicit languages \ntransitioning toward a least-effort based new, commonly understood language, their languages \nremained frozen. Frozen languages and markets we now know offer evidence of missing self-\norganization (Ishikawa, 2006; Podobnik et al.; 2006). As the two languages changed toward \ncommon usage, we should see some terms come to totally dominate the new railroad, other terms \nappear important but not so dominant, and some words would decline to persisting, individual, \nisolated usage. Knowing this least-effort scalability theory, UP management should reasonably \nhave expected and even tried to enable the development of a new cross-merged railroad \nlanguage, with word usage appearing as a newly-formed power law distribution (not that we \nwould expect them to know this part). \nPreferential attachment: This linear positive-feedback process (Krugman, 1996) underlies \nbiological and social networks, going from groups of individuals to groups of organizations. The \nmost common descriptive phrase is, \u2017the rich get richer\u2018 \u2013a basic positive-feedback process \u2013 i.e., \nprofits from one firm allow a rich person to borrow and buy another profitable firm, and so on. \nThe Internet grows according to preferential attachment (Dorogovtsev & Mendes, 2003). The \nsame happens with cities and airport hubs \u2013 larger entities attract even more people or flights \n(Barab\u00e1si 2002). Marketing and sales via the Internet is very much a positive feedback process \n26 \n \n(Gladwell, 2002). Any time a system grows by adding nodes to an existing network their growth \nwill amplify historically generated imbalances among the links. Absent top-down regulation, \nolder nodes will gain more links and generate a Pareto distribution. Since organizations are made \nof social networks, preferential attachment plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of \norganizations. Other examples are Arthur\u2018s (1994) study of increasing returns [firms making \nprofits can invest in things that make even more profits (Microsoft is the best modern example)] \nand the biotech industry (Powell et al., 2005).  \nU.P. Application: This theory suggests that as the UP and SP social and work-related \nnetworks merged, some individuals would emerge as more \u2017connectively\u2018 important in getting \nthe new system and new ways of doing things up and running. Old dominant nodes could \nreasonably be expected to be replaced by new \u2017stars\u2018. Instead, the old-guard railroaders kept \nthemselves dominant and kept the old separate networks dominant \u2013 the old UP network trying \nfor dominance over both railroads; the old SP network in rebellion, passive resistance, and slow-\ndowns rather than joining in a collective reframing of a new combined network. Managers aware \nof this theory would expect network dynamics to change dramatically with the merger and would \n\u2017manage\u2018 toward this end. \nSelf-organized criticality: When irregular grains of sand fall on a sandpile, the effects of \ngravity and friction between sand grains cause the sandpile to constantly reshape itself via small-\nto-large avalanches so as to maintain a specific slope (Bak et al., 1987; Bak 1996). Bak calls this \n\u2017self-organized criticality\u2018 (SOC). This effect occurs because the sand grains are irregular and \nsticky, not smooth like tiny marbles or M&M Peanuts. The distribution of the frequency of the \nmany small avalanches vs. a few large ones shows a power law. Arguing that individual \ndecisions are sticky like irregular sand grains, Bak applies SOC to economies. Since the tension \n27 \n \nbetween supply and demand builds and the actions to reduce it are not of equal size or regularity, \neconomies operate at or near the critical state. Economic fluctuations (business cycles) are SOC \n(Scheinkman & Woodford, 1994). We see SOC in the price of cotton and financial markets \n(Mandelbrot & Hudson, 2004), consumer product sales (Moss, 2002, Sornette et al., 2004), \nentrepreneurial actions leading to different sized firms (Stanley et al., 1996), and in the stock \nmarkets of transition economies (Podobnik et al., 2006) \u2013 all showing power law signatures.  \nU.P. Application: UP management at the time of the merger was totally old-line railroaders \u2013 \nthe CEO started as a brakeman \u2013 one of the least skilled people on a railroad! Management was \ntop-down, centralized, thought of itself as victimized, had demeaning attitudes toward workers, \nworked to prevent improvisation \u2013 what we call self-organization. In short, totally top-down \ncontrol; alas, emergent self-organization was unacceptable. Consequently there could be no \nnotion or reality of SOC \u2013 that is, the workers closest to the operational problems were not \nallowed (actually discouraged) to self-organize toward solutions. Consequently, at a most critical \ntime of adaptation, SOC was absent. Bak (1996) and many others [see Brunk (2002) and Frigg \n(2003) for many more citations] argue that SOC and consequent fractal structures are widespread \nand essential to biological evolution, change, and survival in changing conditions. None of this \nwas allowed at UP. But, management could have used complexity leadership (Hazy et al. 2007; \nMcKelvey, 2008; Uhl-Bien & Marion 2008) to enable SOC dynamics and, thus, more rapid and \neffective change in response to the post-merger conditions. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nWe began by distinguishing between incubation-based and smouldering crises. Turner (1976) \nuses \u2017incubation phase\u2018 instead of smouldering to describe when \u2017\u2026a chain of discrepant events \n28 \n \ndevelop and accumulate unnoticed\u2018 (p. 381; our italics). Reason (1990) calls incubation events \n\u2017pathogens\u2018 \u2013 \u2017minor causes, misperceptions, misunderstandings and miscommunications\u2018. \nLester and King (2006, p. 3, our italics) say that \u2017smouldering crises begin as small, internal \nproblems that...leave a trail of early-warning signals\u2018. Unfortunately, some definitions of \nsmouldering make it look pretty much like incubation. \nWe argue that Holland\u2018s (2002) tiny initiating events (TIEs) are at the base of incubation-\ninduced crises. Using the \u2017total-gridlock\u2018 crisis resulting from the merger of the Union Pacific \n(UP) and Southern Pacific (SP) railroads as a negative risk example, we argue that various \nexternal and internal sources of energy gradients (tension) pushed the merged firm over the \u2017edge \nof order\u2018 into the region of emergence \u2013 i.e., Kauffman\u2018s \u2017melting zone\u2018 (1993). This zone is \ndefined once a system tips over the 1\nst\n critical value (B\u00e9nard, 1901; McKelvey, 2001, 2008). But \nin addition, the tensions in the new UP were so well spread across various levels of the firm that \nmany different degrees of freedom were activated. We show that while many self-organizing \nevents leading up to the disaster emerged in the melting zone, none of the levers management \ncould have used to dampen them emerged. As a result a number of negative TIEs were initiated \nand then they scaled up into extreme outcomes affecting large segments of the railroad. \nCombined, the multiple extreme outcomes here and there across the railroad collectively led to \nthe total gridlock of the UP. \nWe begin with a short pre-merger history of traffic-flow failures on the SP and then describe \nhow TIEs on the UP railroad scaled up to collectively cause total gridlock \u2013 drawing from Span \n(2004), Union Pacific (2008), and Avery & Ericson (2004), along with Weick and Sutcliffe\u2018s \ndescription of the merger fiasco (2001). Then we relate TIEs to Weick\u2018s \u2017mindfulness\u2018 (Weick et \nal., 1999). Next, we review key concepts from complexity science, paying particular attention to: \n29 \n \nfirst, scalability and the scale-free causes that serve to escalate TIEs into extreme outcomes; \nsecond, ideas from econophysics, such as fractals, Pareto and power law rank\/frequency \ndistributions; and third, energy gradients as sources of tension that tip systems across the 1\nst\n \ncritical value and into the region of emergent complexity. We pay special attention to situations \nin which the region is so narrow that order-creation dynamics at both the edge of order and the \nedge of chaos are activated in parallel. When this happens, some number of TIEs are \nsimultaneously activated with the result that several TIEs combine to create the equivalent of \nhurricanes and perfect storms in firms embedded in hi-energy situations and, thus, subject to \nadaptive tension. Then, drawing from the 15 scale-free theories explaining why some TIEs scale \nup into having significant effects described by Andriani and McKelvey (2009), we detail how \nfive of these characterize TIEs on the UP that scaled up to contribute to the total gridlock.  \nEven though TIEs had already caused extreme negative outcomes on the SP, the culture, \narrogance, and firing of SP employees in the post-merged UP prevented the latter from seeing \nthe prior-occurring TIEs and results on the SP. Needless to say, there are many other well-known \npost-disaster studies that have identified the same process. TIEs and employees who see the TIEs \nearly on are simply ignored. The literature on risk management tells this story about incubation \ncrises over and over. Building from the phrase, \u2017You don\u2019t see what you aren\u2019t looking for\u2018, our \nprimary argument is that learning about scale-free causes and how they might show up on the \nUP, or in any other firm, would help managers know sooner and better what kinds of activities \nmight start scaling up into extreme outcomes. In this way we aim to improve managers\u2018 \u2017seeing\u2018 \nability. Weick is on the right track with his mindfulness concept, but details as to how \nmindfulness translated into seeing ability remains vague and without much theory or research \nbasis. One can ask: Mindful about what? The problem is how to get ahead of post-crisis case \n30 \n \nanalyses and storytelling.  \nWe discuss ways in which five scale-free causes combined after the merger \u2013 under the \ntension of the UP acquiring an already problematic SP \u2013to spiral up to create total gridlock. \nThese causes are widely recognized elsewhere as some of the fifteen scale-free causes Andriani \nand McKelvey (2009) assemble from various sources in the literature. With these, we give \nmindfulness theoretical substance. There are indeed various kinds of smouldering TIEs that \nmanagers can become more sensitive to in advance. And, finally, managers need to not forget \nthat every time increased tension hits, it is what Smith (2002) calls a \u2017trigger event\u2018 \u2013 whether \nthe tension is caused by management as in the examples of what the Russians call \u2017storming\u2019 \n(Radell, 1992), or impinges from the surrounding environment, what are ordinarily meaningless, \nchaotic, random-appearing incidents that can usually be ignored, all of a sudden have a high \nprobability of combining to trigger extreme negative outcomes. \nREFERENCES \nAnderson, J.

Speed of trains drops from 19 to 12 mph 8. Crews falling asleep while running trains \n9. Four employees killed in yard accidents 10. Collisions kill seven more people \n11.

Trains stuck on sidings without locomotives \n3. Oct. 8;  550 freights standing still 4. All sidings filled with backed up trains \n5. Englewood yard locked up with 6,179 cars 6. Stalled trains meant crews\u2018 duty time expired \n7.Trains going in opposite directions couldn\u2018t pass each \nother on a single mainline because sidings were filled with \nbacked-up trains \n8. Since most stalled trains were pointed toward the \nEnglewood yard in Huston, no trains could leave Englewood \nbecause of the blocked mainlines \n9. 1800 locomotives unavailable because they were stuck in \nthe wrong place  \n10. Sorting of car into trains by destination was centralized, \nthereby exacerbating the delays \n11. More engines sent to Englewood to unblock system; but \nthey just added to the blockage \n12. Denial of failures repeated at all levels of the hierarchy \n13. Top management ignored early warning signs 14.
