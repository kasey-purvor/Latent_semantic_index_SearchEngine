The\npro\ress of transition from laminar to turbulent \row is thought to begin with the rapid growth of small\ndisturban\res in laminar \row.\nPlane Poiseuille or \rhannel \row, the unidire\rtional \row between in\fnite parallel planes, is a simple\n\row that is prone to transition. Experiments show that this \row undergoes transition to turbulen\re for\nReynolds number as low as 1000, for example as shown by Carlson et al. (1982).\nFluid \row-\feld velo\rity and pressure, and wall shear stresses, \ran be measured. The \row \ran be in\ruen\red\nby the manipulation of the \ronditions on its boundaries, su\rh as the inje\rtion and su\rtion of \ruid at the\nwalls, known as wall transpiration. This opens up the possibility of the \rontrol of the evolution of transition\nby the feedba\rk \rontrol of \row measurements to suitable wall a\rtuators. The governing Navier-Stokes and\n\rontinuity equations \ran be used to develop plant models for the synthesis of \rontrollers. Linear plant\nmodels are often based on spe\rtral analysis of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations, e.g. as performed by\nBaramov et al. (2001), Bewley and Liu (1998), and Joshi et al. (1999).\nExperiments to dete\rt transition, even in su\rh a simple \row, are di\u00c6\rult and expensive to perform,\nbut \romputational \ruid dynami\rs (CFD) has progressed to the stage where it \ran be used to simulate\nthe performan\re of \rontrollers. Baramov et al. (2001) used spe\rialised \fnite-di\u000beren\re full Navier-Stokes\nsolvers, and the widely \rited work of Bewley et al. (2001) employed hybrid spe\rtral \fnite-di\u000beren\re full\nNavier-Stokes solvers. However little use has been made of \fnite-volume CFD \rodes other than that by\nBalogh et al. (2000) testing low speed global Lyapunov stabilization, although their use is widespread in\nother \felds, for example see Yeoh et al. (2004).\nAlthough plane Poiseuille \row undergoes transition to turbulen\re for Reynolds number as low as 1000,\nit is known to be linearly stable at Reynolds numbers below approximately 5772, as \ral\rulated by Orszag\n(1971). The o\r\rurren\re of transition in the linearly stable regime is thought to be due to large transient\nenergy growth \rausing non-linear e\u000be\rts. Transient energy growth is the ampli\f\ration of the kineti\r energy\n\rontained in an initial perturbation. Trefethen et al. (1993) note that the large transient energy growth\nis itself due to non-normality of the system eigenve\rtors. Hinri\rhsen et al. (2002) have investigated state\nfeedba\rk stabilization with guaranteed transient bounds and Whidborne et al. (2005) have derived \ron-\ntrollers whi\rh minimise maximum transient energy growth. Although non-normal behaviour is the \rause\nof the transient growth, little is known regarding the pairs of modes involved.\nThis paper des\rribes the synthesis of optimal linear quadrati\r \rontrollers using a state-spa\re model of\nplane Poiseuille \row. This work is not the \frst to use linear quadrati\r \rontrol for plane Poiseuille \row.\nJoshi et al. (1999) des\rribed the appli\ration of linear system theory to a stream fun\rtion formulation of\nlinearised plane Poiseuille \row, limited to streamwise\/wall-normal disturban\res. The paper by Bewley and\nLiu (1998) is seminal, and to some extent, the work des\rribed here is motivated by their results from\ninvestigations of \rontrol of a spe\rtral linear velo\rity\/vorti\rity model at a single wavenumber pair using an\ninterpolating basis for wall-normal behaviour.\nHere, in \rontrast to the approa\rh of Bewley and Liu, the state-spa\re model employs a polynomial wall-\nnormal basis derived by M\rKernan (2006), whi\rh, using a rigorous appli\ration of the boundary \ronditions,\nMay 2, 2007 17:26 International Journal of Control ij\r\nJ. M\rkernan, J.F. Whidborne and G. Papadakis 5\nprodu\res a system free of spurious eigenmodes, and leads to \rontrol via rate of \rhange of wall-normal\ntranspiration velo\rity. Furthermore, the transient energy matrix is rigorously derived, and tuned pro\ress\nnoise \rovarian\re matri\res are investigated. In addition, the \rontrollers synthesized are subsequently tested\nin a full model of the \row, namely a \fnite-volume non-linear Navier-Stokes solver. Thus the \rontrollers are\ntested using a well tried non-linear algorithm whi\rh is \rompletely independent of the development model.\nLike Bewley and Liu, a single wavenumber pair is \rontrolled, and the pair sele\rted represents streamwise\nvorti\res, whi\rh lead to the largest transient energy growth. These perturbations are streamwise \ronstant,\nwhi\rh allows the subsequent \fnite volume simulations to be two-dimensional.\nSe\rtion 2 and 3 brie\ry introdu\re plane Poiseuille \row and the linear plant model. For a full derivation\nof the model see M\rKernan (2006). Se\rtion 4 des\rribes the synthesis of optimal state feedba\rk \rontrollers\nand optimal state estimators. The \rontrollers are linear quadrati\r regulators (LQR), whi\rh are optimal\nin the sense of minimising a quadrati\r \rost fun\rtional of the weighted state variables and \rontrol inputs.\nThe estimators are linear quadrati\r estimators (LQE), whi\rh are optimal in the sense of minimising\nthe expe\rtation of the state estimation errors, given weighting matri\res whi\rh represent the pro\ress and\nmeasurement noise \rovarian\res. The se\rtion also des\rribes the sele\rtion of appropriate weighting matri\res.\nSe\rtion 5 des\rribes the linear and non-linear simulations undertaken on the open- and \rlosed-loop sys-\ntems. The open-loop (OL) systems \romprise the plant model with LQE state estimator and the \rlosed-\nloop systems \romprise the plant model with state feedba\rk LQR \rontrol, and with output feedba\rk linear\nquadrati\r Gaussian (LQG) \rontrol, the latter formed by employing both the LQE estimator and LQR\n\rontroller. The se\rtion states the derivation of the worst initial \ronditions and the \ronditions for minimum\ntransient energy growth, and derives plant modal and non-modal energy terms and an upper bound on\nmode pair energy growth.\nFinally se\rtion 7 draws \ron\rlusions regarding the \rontroller and estimator synthesis, and the \rontroller\nand estimator performan\re in the linear and non-linear simulations.\n2 Plane Poiseuille Flow Control\nIn\rompressible \ruid \row is des\rribed by the Navier-Stokes and \rontinuity equations. The Navier-Stokes\nequations (1) form a set of three \roupled, non-linear, partial di\u000berential equations representing \ronservation\nof momentum, and the \rontinuity equation is an additional \ronstraint representing the \ronservation of mass\n(2);-\n_\n~\nU +\n\u0010\n~\nU \u0001 r\n\u0011\n~\nU = \u0000\n1\n\u001a\nrP +\n\u0016\n\u001a\nr\n2\n~\nU (1)\nr \u0001\n~\nU = 0 (2)\nwhere\n~\nU; P; \u001a; \u0016 are velo\rity, pressure, density and vis\rosity respe\rtively.\nLaminar Poiseuille \row has a paraboli\r streamwise velo\rity pro\fle, with no slip o\r\rurring at the bounding\nparallel planes.

Sin\re these are rates of \rhange, the system \rontains two integrators,\nea\rh with an eigenve\rtor representing steady state transpiration from a wall. This situation arises sin\re, for\nthis linearised \row model, steady transpiration at a set velo\rity merely superimposes a velo\rity \row \feld\non the existing perturbation.

The \rlosed-loop state feedba\rk LQR system is\n_\nX = (A\u0000BK)X\nY = CX (8)\nThe state feedba\rk \rontrollerK is the optimal for all initial \ronditions (Skogestad and Postlethwaite, 1996,\np354).\nIn most problems the weighting matri\res are tuned by hand. However, for a \ruid system this is not\npra\rti\ral be\rause of the large number of state variables. Furthermore, it is useful to employ a weighting\nmatrix Q that is de\fned independently of the \rhosen state-spa\re basis sin\re then there is freedom to\nalter either. It is also helpful if the weights are de\fned independently of the level of dis\rretisation, in order\nto make interpretation of results easier, as re\rommended by Lauga and Bewley (2004). Bewley and Liu\n(1998) suggests that a natural \rhoi\re for the matrix Q is su\rh that X\nT\nQX represents the dis\rretized form\nof the transient energy E,\nE =\n1\nV\nZ\nvol=V\n\u001a\n~u\nT\n~u\n2\ndvol (9)\nwhere E has dimensions energy per unit volume, and ~u is the perturbation velo\rity ve\rtor. This \rhoi\re\nof Q is independent of the de\fnition of the state variables, is independent (in the limiting \rase) of the\ndis\rretisation N , and also means that the LQR problem (6) minimises E in some sense. This evaluation\nof the transient energy requires that the state variables remain physi\rally meaningful, and thus model\nredu\rtion is not possible.\nMatrix Q e\u000be\rtively performs quadrature on the wall-normal velo\rity ~v, velo\rity derivative\n\b~v=\by and vorti\rity ~\u0011 values at the \rollo\ration (dis\rretisation) points a\rross the \rhannel. The\nstate variables and thus the energy matrix employed in this paper are based on a polynomial\nChebyshev form with the \rhannel wall and next-to-wall Navier-Stokes equations omitted,\nMay 2, 2007 17:26 International Journal of Control ij\r\n8 Linear Quadrati\r Control of Plane Poiseuille Flow\nand the highest order Chebyshev series \roe\u00c6\rients a (5A) dis\rarded, as required during\nthe appli\ration of the boundary \ronditions, as des\rribed in M\rKernan (2006). The velo\rity\nderivatives are obtained via well-behaved algebrai\r di\u000berentiation of the Chebyshev series.\nThe polynomial form is amenable to the \roe\u00c6\rient dis\rarding des\rribed above, due to the\nspe\rtral de\ray of the \roe\u00c6\rients, and analyti\ral and numeri\ral tests validate the expression\nused here for Q on distributions of velo\rity and vorti\rity whi\rh ful\fll the open- and \rlosed-\nloop boundary \ronditions.\nThe state variables and energy matrix derived by Bewley and Liu (1998, p312) are based\non an interpolating Chebyshev form with the \rhannel wall values omitted. Quadrature on\nvelo\rity and vorti\rity values in the open-loop \rase when the wall values are zero is appro-\npriate, and a small approximation in their \rontribution to the transient energy o\r\rurs when\nthe wall-velo\rity is non-zero in the \rlosed-loop \rase, as some energy very \rlose to the wall\nis negle\rted. However, omitting the \rhannel wall values in the \rlosed-loop \rase, when the\nwall velo\rity values are not zero, leads to the interpolating form assuming zero wall values,\nand this produ\res well-known high order interpolation os\rillation (Press et al., 1986, p77)\nand in parti\rular large and ina\r\rurate derivatives at \rollo\ration points as subsequently used\nby quadrature of the velo\rity derivative in the \ral\rulation of the transient energy. For this\nreason no meaningful \romparison \ran be made with Bewley's \rlosed-loop results.\nRegarding \rontrol weightings, we set R = r\n2\nI, thus allowing variation of \rontrol magnitude, while\nmaintaining equivalent real and imaginary \rontrol e\u000be\rt on both walls.\n4.2 Optimal Estimation\nThe standard LQE \rontrol problem assumes that the system has disturban\re and measurement noise input\npro\resses w\nd\nand w\nn\nrespe\rtively\n_\nX = AX+BU+ w\nd\nY = CX+ w\nn\n(10)\nand that the noise inputs are un\rorrelated, zero-mean, Gaussian sto\rhasti\r pro\resses with \ronstant power\nspe\rtral density matri\res V andW (Skogestad and Postlethwaite, 1996).

Here the \rovarian\re between pairs of variables is set as\nW =\n\"\n\u0002\n(1\u0000 y\n2\nk1\n)(1\u0000 y\n2\nk2\n)\n\u0003\nk1;k2=0;2;:::;N\u00002;N\n0\n0\n\u0002\n(1\u0000 y\n2\nk1\n)(1\u0000 y\n2\nk2\n)\n\u0003\nk1;k2=1:::N\u00001\n#\n(16)\nwhere y\nk1\n; y\nk2\nare the lo\rations of pairs of state variables k1 and k2 in \rollo\ration point value form\nX\n\rp\n. This \rhoi\re implies that the \rovarian\re between velo\rity state variables at lo\rations y\nk1\nand y\nk2\nis (1 \u0000 y\n2\nk1\n)(1 \u0000 y\n2\nk2\n), and similarly between vorti\rity state variables. Estimators synthesized using this\nassumption will hen\reforth be referred to as `tuned' estimators.\nFor tuned estimators, when k1 = k2, W represents the varian\re of the noise on a single state variable,\nwhi\rh therefore varies as (1 \u0000 y\n2\nk1\n)\n2\n. Thus disturban\res on a single state variable have a higher standard\ndeviation (the positive square root of varian\re) at the \rentreline (y = 0), than near the walls (y = \u00061).\nThese varian\res are \rompatible with velo\rity disturban\res near the \rentreline being more variable than\nthose near the walls and similarly for vorti\rity disturban\res. At the walls, the velo\rities are set reasonably\na\r\rurately by the \rontroller, so they are given small varian\re (10\n\u00003\n).\nWhen k1 6= k2, W represents the \rovarian\re of a pair of state variables. Pairs \rlose to the walls have\nlow \rovarian\res, whereas pairs \rlose to the \rentreline (y = 0) have high \rovarian\res. Pairs where one state\nvariable is near a wall, and the other near the \rentreline have \rovarian\res in between. These \rovarian\res\nare \rompatible with velo\rity disturban\res near the \rentreline being physi\rally larger than those near the\nwalls and similarly for vorti\rity disturban\res. The \rovarian\re between velo\rity and vorti\rity state variables\nis set to zero. These \rovarian\res vary smoothly over the \rollo\ration point state variables, and many other\nsu\rh distributions are possible e.g. those proposed by H\u001bp\u000bner et al. (2005).\nBy the symmetry and independen\re of the measurements (upper and lower wall, real and imaginary\nMay 2, 2007 17:26 International Journal of Control ij\r\n10 Linear Quadrati\r Control of Plane Poiseuille Flow\nFourier \romponents of shear stress), it is reasonable to assume that the measurement noise \rovarian\re is\nV = sI, where s is a positive tuning parameter, whi\rh s\rales the measurement noise against the pro\ress\nnoise.\nAn estimator L designed in terms of these velo\rity and vorti\rity state variables, may be transformed\nba\rk for use on the untransformed state variables as T\n\u00001\n\rp\nL.\n4.3 Closed-Loop LQG Output Feedba\rk System\nThe \rombined plant, LQR \rontroller and LQE estimator may be \rombined into an LQG output feedba\rk\nsystem, with dynami\rs\n\"\n_\nX\n_\n^\nX\n#\n=\n\"\nA \u0000BK\nLC A\u0000BK\u0000 LC\n#\"\nX\n^\nX\n#\n+\n\"\nI 0\n0 L\n#\"\n!\nd\n!\nn\n#\n(17)\nwhere the estimate and state dynami\rs are not independent but are intentionally \roupled.

Final \rontrollers and estimators are sele\rted on the grounds of lowest energy bounds.\nDetailed linear simulations are performed for the open-loop, state feedba\rk and output feedba\rk systems,\nfrom the worst initial \ronditions, using the Matlab fun\rtion lsim.\nA \fnite-volume \romputational \ruid dynami\rs (CFD) Navier-Stokes solver is used for the non-linear\nsimulations. This solver makes no assumption of spe\rtral behaviour, solves the full non-linear Navier-\nStokes equations, and is \rompletely independent of the spe\rtral \rode used for the \rontroller synthesis\nand linear simulations. See (M\rKernan, 2006) for details of the solver \rode, and of the modi\f\rations\nrequired, together with des\rriptions of the meshes, \ruid properties, and boundary \ronditions, and of the\nimplementation of the \rontroller into the \rode.\n6 Results and Dis\russion\nThis se\rtion des\rribes the results of \rontroller and estimator synthesis, and linear and non-linear simula-\ntions of the open-loop, state feedba\rk and output feedba\rk systems from the worst initial \ronditions. A\nwall-normal dis\rretisation of N = 100 is used, to ensure \ronvergen\re with N , ex\rept where the issue of\n\ronvergen\re itself is investigated. As the wall-normal dis\rretisation method is based on Chebyshev series it\n\ronverges exponentially (Boyd, 2001, p46). Sin\re the rate of \ronvergen\re is so fast, su\r\ressful \ronvergen\re\nis assessed by graphi\ral inspe\rtion.\n6.1 Controller synthesis\nLQR \rontrollers are synthesized for a range of \rontrol weights r = 2\n1\n: : : 2\n14\n, by solving the algebrai\r\nRi\r\rati equation (ARE) (7) with R = r\n2\nI, for dis\rretisation N = 100. The Matlab Release 11 fun\rtions\n\rare (\ralled via lqr) and aresolv, with both eigen and s\rhur options are used, to investigate whi\rh\nperforms best on su\rh a large system. The Matlab fun\rtion aresolv option eigen, produ\res the lowest\nrelative residuals i.e. the Frobenius norm of the residual divided by that of the solution kri\r(P)k\nF\n= kPk\nF\n.\nThese residuals are less than 10\n\u00009\n, and are of a\r\reptably small magnitude. The fun\rtion reports that the\nproblem is well posed, implying no parti\rular problems solving the equation for su\rh a large system, at\nleast for this system and range of weights, although numeri\ral problems arise outside this range. Other\nlibrary routines, su\rh as Sli\rot sl\rares (Benner et al., 1999; Van Hu\u000bel et al., 2004), and newer te\rhniques,\nsu\rh those derived by Morris and Navas\ra (2005), may be able to extend the range of weights.\nThe variation of dia\rhroni\r transient energy bound with \rontrol weight r is shown in \fgure 1. Several\ndis\rretisations N are shown, and \ronvergen\re with N is relatively fast and has o\r\rurred by N = 30. The\n\rontinued \ronvergen\re at high N again demonstrates the existen\re of few problems solving this parti\rular\nsystem when N is very large. The range of weights is appropriate for \rontroller synthesis, sin\re it \rovers\n\ronvergen\re at low r, where the \rontrol e\u000bort is large and the energy is small. As the \rontrol weight rises,\nthe \rontrol e\u000bort falls, and thus the energy bound rises. The variation here is monotoni\r, but need not\nbe if very high \rontrol (very low weight) itself in\rreases transient energy, as investigated by M\rKernan et\nal. (2005). A value of r = 128 was sele\rted for subsequent simulations, as this produ\res almost the lowest\ndia\rhroni\r transient energy bound, without being unne\ressarily small, whi\rh would lead to unne\ressarily\nlarge \rontrol e\u000bort. Low dia\rhroni\r transient energy bound implies low transient energy over all unit\nMay 2, 2007 17:26 International Journal of Control ij\r\n16 Linear Quadrati\r Control of Plane Poiseuille Flow\nenergy initial \ronditions and all time, thus redu\ring the possibility of non-linear behaviour and transition\nto turbulen\re.\n6.2 Estimator synthesis\nLQE estimators are synthesized for a range of measurement noise weights s, by solving the algebrai\r\nRi\r\rati equation (ARE) (14) with V = sI, using the Matlab fun\rtions \rare (\ralled via lqe) and aresolv,\nwith both eigen and s\rhur options, for N = 100. The Matlab fun\rtion aresolv option eigen generally\nprodu\res the lowest relative residuals, less than 10\n\u00007\nfor the tuned estimator, and the fun\rtion reports\nthat the problem is well posed. The residuals are of a\r\reptably small magnitude, but not as small as those\nfound during the synthesis of \rontrollers.\nGood estimator performan\re requires that the estimator poles be faster (real part more negative) than\nthe plant poles. However, the \rurrent plant has a large number of poles, the faster ones of whi\rh are not\nknown a\r\rurately, and it is not feasible to make the slowest estimator poles faster than these.\nConvergen\re of Estimated Energy Bound \u0012\nEst\nwith N is relatively slow, as \rompared to that of the\n\rontroller, and does not o\r\rur until N = 70, whi\rh is \ronsistent with the behaviour of the wall eigenve\rtor\ngradients used for observation as found by M\rKernan (2006).\nThe worst estimator initial error \ronditions X\nError;Worst\nare found to be very exa\rting, sin\re they\nlead to growth of dia\rhroni\r error energy bound \u0012\nError\nof \romparable magnitude to the plant dia\rhroni\r\ntransient energy bound. Sin\re the estimators are stable and their states \ronverge upon the plant states,\nit is di\u00c6\rult to see how su\rh estimator initial \ronditions \rould o\r\rur. In \rontrast, zero estimates\n^\nX = 0\nare to be expe\rted upon initialisation of the estimators, implying initial errors equal to the plant initial\n\ronditions, X\nError\n= X\nWorst\n.\nFurthermore, for the LQG \rontroller, both plant and estimator initial \ronditions need to be sele\rted. It\nis not \rlear how to sele\rt the relative magnitudes of the initial plant energy and estimator error energy,\nsin\re the plant energy is a physi\ral quantity whi\rh leads to transition, whereas the estimator error energy\nis not. Again, zero initial estimates are a reasonable assumption to make.\nA\r\rordingly, zero initial estimates are sele\rted in preferen\re to the worst estimator initial error \ronditions\nfor further simulations in the present work. Plots of estimated energy bound and slowest estimator pole\n(M\rKernan, 2006) favour the use of the tuned estimator over the uniform estimator, at low measurement\nnoise. A weight of s = 2\n\u00006\n\u0019 0:0156 is sele\rted for further work, as this produ\res \rlose to the lowest\nestimated energy bound.\n6.3 Initial Conditions\nSyn\rhroni\r Transient Energy Bound \u000f vs Time. Figure 2 shows open-loop syn\rhroni\r transient energy\nbound, \u000f(t), against time. As the eigenvalues in the test \rase are real and stable, the only me\rhanism for\ngrowth is non-modal, and this is \ron\frmed by the non-linear nature of the logarithmi\r plot. The graph\nof the syn\rhroni\r transient energy bound against time is \ronvex, and so there are no root bra\rketing\nproblems. A golden se\rtion sear\rh (Press et al., 1986, p277) produ\res a maximum at 4896:94 at t = 379:16\nand thus \u0012 = 4896:94. This value \rompares well with \u0012 = 4897 at t = 379 as reported by Butler and Farrell\n(1992, p1647). A bise\rtion sear\rh (Press et al., 1986, p246) based on the \rriteria X\nT\nAX = 0, as des\rribed\nby Whidborne et al. (2004) proves ina\r\rurate in this \rase.\nAs shown from (27), the syn\rhroni\r transient energy bound \ran be expressed as the square of the spe\rtral\nMay 2, 2007 17:26 International Journal of Control ij\r\nJ. M\rkernan, J.F. Whidborne and G. Papadakis 17\nnorm of the state transition matrix. Now the Frobenius norm squared provides a upper bound on the square\nof the spe\rtral norm, and 1=min (l;m) times the Frobenius norm squared provides a lower bound, where\nthe matri\res are l by m (Skogestad and Postlethwaite, 1996, p520). Figure 2 also shows the Frobenius\nnorm of the state transition matrix and it \ran be seen that the syn\rhroni\r transient energy bound \u000f(t)\nlies within the \rorre\rt bounds. The \rorresponding plots for the LQR \rontrolled systems are qualitatively\nsimilar to \fgure 2.\nInvestigation of Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Dia\rhroni\r Transient Energy Bound \u0012. Investigations of\nthe modes whi\rh lead to maximum open-loop dia\rhroni\r transient energy bound are performed. For the\nremainder of this subse\rtion, the state variables employed are transformed to\n~\nX, as de\fned in se\rtion 5.1\nsu\rh that E =\n~\nX\n~\nX, and the eigenve\rtors are expressed in the same state variables, and normalised to unit\nmagnitude, unless stated otherwise. Eigenve\rtors are in order of in\rreasing eigenvalue stability.\nFigure 3 shows a bar \rhart of the dot produ\rt between pairs of modes from 1 to 25. The main diagonal\nhas unit magnitude, due to the normalisation \rhosen. The next highest dot produ\rts are on the adja\rent\ndiagonals, \rorresponding to mode pairs \romprising \ronse\rutive mode pairs. The dot produ\rts of \ronse\rutive\nopen-loop\n~\nXmodes, together with the vorti\rity ~\u0011 eigenve\rtors (the velo\rity eigenve\rtors are mu\rh smaller in\nmagnitude) appear in \fgure 4. It \ran be seen that a high dot produ\rt \rorresponds to vorti\rity eigenve\rtors\nof similar shape (within re\re\rtion), whi\rh is to be expe\rted sin\re similar mode shapes imply similar state\nvariable ve\rtors, and thus high dot produ\rts.\nFigure 5 shows the same plot for the LQR system, for whi\rh the dia\rhroni\r transient energy bound is\nredu\red. It \ran be seen that in general the modes have \romparable dot-produ\rts as in the open-loop \fgure 4\nand thus remain as non-normal or non-orthogonal as in the open-loop \rase. The dia\rhroni\r transient energy\nbound is known to be minimised to a value of unity when the modes are made pre\risely orthogonal but\nwhen pre\rise orthogonality is not a\rhieved, as here, the e\u000be\rt of in\rreasing orthogonality may not produ\re\nthe lowest energy, as shown in se\rtion 5.1, and thus the absen\re of a distin\rt redu\rtion of non-normality\nis not surprising. It is suggested that the LQR \rontroller dire\rtly a\u000be\rting the modal orthogonality is\nunlikely, \rontrary to observations by Bewley and Liu (1998, p343).\nThe open-loop upper bounds on mode pair energy growth E\npair;bound\n, \ral\rulated using the expressions\nderived in se\rtion 5.1, from the worst initial \ronditions, are presented in \fgure 6. As would be expe\rted, the\n\rhart is symmetri\ral. Few mode pairs appear to have a signi\f\rant potential for transient energy growth,\nwith the ex\reption of pair 4,5.\nFigure 7 shows the upper bounds on mode pair energy growth after the appli\ration of LQR \rontrol,\nfrom the worst initial \ronditions. More mode pairs have a signi\f\rant potential for transient energy growth,\nthose with the largest potential being 1,5 and 1,4. These signi\f\rant pairs are not \ronse\rutive modes, unlike\nthe open loop signi\f\rant pair 4,5. The largest upper bound of all the pairs has fallen from approximately\n2:5\u0002 10\n5\nto 3\u0002 10\n3\n, due to the appli\ration of LQR \rontrol.\n6.4 Linear Simulations\nThe results of linear simulations on the open- and \rlosed-loop systems are investigated in detail in this\nse\rtion.\nOpen-Loop Linear Simulation. Five di\u000berent plant dis\rretisations, N = 10; 20; 30; 40; 50, are simulated\nand the results are presented in \fgure 8, of open-loop transient energy against time. The results are\nMay 2, 2007 17:26 International Journal of Control ij\r\n18 Linear Quadrati\r Control of Plane Poiseuille Flow\n\ronverged at N = 20 and above, showing that a low dis\rretisation of N = 20 is adequate to simulate\nthe open-loop \rase. Sin\re the dia\rhroni\r transient energy bound is maximised over time, and larger than\none, the transient energy starts at a minimum. Here the transient energy rea\rhes the dia\rhroni\r transient\nenergy bound value of 4896:94 at time 379:5, \rlose to the predi\rted value of 4896:94 at time 379:16 from\nse\rtion 6.3, before de\raying to zero. The small dis\rrepan\ry is \raused by the linear simulation results being\nprovided at dis\rrete timesteps. Cal\rulations using (37) show that mode pair (4; 5) provides substantial\ngrowth of transient energy as predi\rted in \fgure 6 (M\rKernan, 2006, p151).\nLQR State Feedba\rk Linear Simulation. As the ~v initial \ronditions are symmetri\ral about the \rentreline,\nthe \rontrol signal at the lower wall\n_\n~v(y = \u00001) is identi\ral to that at the upper wall. However, as the sense\nof the upper and lower wall boundaries are reversed, transpiration su\rtion at the upper wall, ~v(y = 1) > 0,\n\rorresponds to blowing at the lower wall. Figure 9 shows the LQR \rontrol signal at the upper wall\n_\n~v(y = 1)\nagainst time.\nFigure 10 displays the time integral of the LQR \rontrol signal at the upper wall, namely the Fourier\n\roe\u00c6\rient of the upper wall velo\rity, whi\rh has real and imaginary \romponents to allow variations in both\nthe magnitude and spatial phase of the transpiration. For the test \rase \ronsidered here, the upper wall\ntranspiration velo\rity is imaginary, i.e. in phase with the disturban\re velo\rity but out of phase with the\nvorti\rity whi\rh is assumed real (M\rKernan, 2006, p43). The \roe\u00c6\rient magnitude peaks at approximately\n1.75, i.e. 1.75 times the base \row \rentreline velo\rity. However, this \fgure is for a unit initial transient\nenergy. The kineti\r energy density of the base \row is 1=15 \u0019 0:0667. For an initial perturbation energy of\n10% of the base \row energy, the upper wall velo\rity would peak at around 1:75\u0002\np\n0:00667, approximately\n0:14, and for a perturbation energy of 1% of base \row, the velo\rity would peak at approximately 0:045\ntimes the base \row \rentreline velo\rity. This represents the transpiration at reasonable velo\rity.\nThe double time integral of the LQR \rontrol signal at the upper wall, namely the Fourier \roe\u00c6\rient of\nthe upper wall \ruid quantity transpired, versus time is displayed in \fgure 11. Although the net amount\nof \ruid transpired is zero sin\re the distribution is sinusoidal, this \roe\u00c6\rient represents the magnitude of\nthe sinusoidal distribution. The \roe\u00c6\rient magnitude peaks at around 515, i.e. 515 times the \rhannel half\nheight, for a unit energy initial perturbation. For an initial perturbation energy 1% of that of the base\n\row, the quantity would peak at approximately 13:3 times the \rhannel half height. This represents the\ntranspiration of a \romparatively large amount of \ruid, requiring a large asso\riated reservoir or distribution\nsystem. The \fnal \roe\u00c6\rient is not zero, representing a permanent transport of transpiration \ruid within\nea\rh spatial period, and thus any reservoirs do not return to their initial level, but instead \ruid has been\npermanently moved between them.\nFigure 12 presents the LQR transient energy against time. The \rontroller is able to limit the transient\nenergy to 848:80, whi\rh is \ronsistent with the value of 848:81 from \fgure 1, as \rompared to the open-loop\nvalue of 4896:94. Thus the \rontroller e\u000be\rtively limits the growth of the worst \rase disturban\re. Three\ndi\u000berent dis\rretisations N are shown, and \ronvergen\re has o\r\rurred for even the lowest N = 30.\nThe LQR \rontroller minimises the time integral of the transient energy plus weighted \rontrol e\u000bort, from\nall initial \ronditions, rather than the dia\rhroni\r transient energy bound itself, although the dia\rhroni\r\ntransient energy bound has been redu\red from 4896:94 to 848:80 as a \ronsequen\re. Cal\rulations using (37)\nshow that mode pairs (1; 4) and (1; 5) provide substantial growth of transient energy as predi\rted in \fgure\n6 (M\rKernan, 2006, p158).\nMay 2, 2007 17:26 International Journal of Control ij\r\nJ.

The tuned estimator \ronverges on the plant energy mu\rh faster than the uniform\nestimator. Figure 14 shows LQE transient energy against time, for the tuned estimator, for several dis-\n\rretisations N . It is evident that the behaviour of the estimator is not fully \ronverged below approximately\nN = 50.\nLQG Output Feedba\rk Linear Simulation. Figure 15 shows the LQG transient energy and estimated\ntransient energy against time. The \rontroller is able to produ\re an dia\rhroni\r transient energy bound of\napproximately 934:00, only slightly larger than the LQR state feedba\rk value of 848:80.\n6.5 Summary of Dia\rhroni\r Transient Energy Bound \u0012 Results\nAs a \rhe\rk, table 1 exhibits a summary of the dia\rhroni\r transient energy bound values of the open-loop\nand LQR state feedba\rk systems, from both the dia\rhroni\r transient energy bound eigensystem (26), and\nthe linear simulation from the worst initial \ronditions. The small dis\rrepan\ries are thought to be due to\nnumeri\ral ina\r\rura\ries, amongst whi\rh are the dis\rrete time steps used in the linear simulations.\nTable 2 shows a summary of the dia\rhroni\r transient energy bound values from the open-loop and\nfeedba\rk systems, and also in\rludes the estimated energy bound a\rhieved by the LQE estimator on the\nopen-loop and LQG systems, from zero initial estimates.\n6.6 Choi\re of Dis\rretisation N for Controller in Non-Linear Simulations\nThe non-linear simulations require signi\f\rantly more \romputing time than the linear ones, in the order of\ndays rather than minutes, on a Pentium 4\nTM\npersonal \romputer. It is appropriate to \ronsider the \rhoi\re\nof dis\rretisation for the \rontrollers to be applied to the non-linear models. Sin\re no \rontroller redu\rtion\nis employed, this equates to the dis\rretisation of the spe\rtral model used for the \rontroller synthesis. The\nissue of dis\rretisation of the non-linear model itself is \ronsidered by M\rKernan (2006).\nFor the LQR \rontroller synthesis to \ronverge N = 30 is su\u00c6\rient (se\rtion 6.1), and for the LQE estimator\nsynthesis N = 70 is su\u00c6\rient (se\rtion 6.2). The linear simulations require N = 30 for the LQR system\nand N = 50 for the LQE system (se\rtion 6.4). The more exa\rting requirement of LQE is thought to be\nrelated to the \ronvergen\re of the wall gradients and observability.\nFor the observability and wall gradients to have \ronverged for the \frst 20 modes, approximately N = 100\nis required a\r\rording to M\rKernan (2006). The need for \fne dis\rretisation at the wall is well known within\nthe \ruid dynami\rs \rommunity. A\r\rordingly, \rontrollers synthesized using a spe\rtral model using N = 100\nare used within the non-linear simulations.\n6.7 Non Linear Simulations\nA linear \rontroller synthesized using a linearisation of a non-linear model will be able to stabilise the full\nmodel given initial \ronditions near the linearisation equilibrium point, and provided the traje\rtories do\nnot stray far from the equilibrium point. However, if large transients take traje\rtories far away from the\nequilibrium point, non-linear e\u000be\rts may predominate and the system may not be stable.\nThis se\rtion explores the performan\re of the \rontrollers on a non-linear model of the plant, from small\nand large initial perturbations.

This value \rorresponds to an initial transient energy of E\n0\n(2:26 \u0002 10\n\u00009\n), and has been shown\nby M\rKernan (2006, p166) to indu\re less than 1% non-linearity (as de\fned by the ratio of non-linear\n\ronve\rtion (~u \u0001 r) ~u to base \row \ronve\rtion\n\u0010\n~\nU\nb\n\u0001 r\n\u0011\n~u in the Navier-Stokes equations (3) ) in a region\nthat \rovers more than 90% of the \row \feld area. Closed-loop worst initial \ronditions of equal transient\nenergy to the \rorresponding open-loop \rase are used.\nResults from non-linear \fnite-volume CFD simulations from small perturbation initial \ronditions are\ngenerally \rlose to those from the spe\rtral linear simulations, despite the fa\rt that the \fnite-volume and\nspe\rtral simulation \rodes have been independently developed. The only ex\reption is the behaviour of the\nestimator in the LQG output feedba\rk simulations, whi\rh shows a small dis\rrepan\ry, although the plant\nenergies agree well.\nThese small perturbation non-linear simulations show agreement between peak transient energy as \rom-\nputed from the states by E = X\nT\nQX and as \ral\rulated by dire\rt integration over the mesh using (9)\nto within 0:3% for the LQR system. This result shows that the \ral\rulation of the states is substantially\n\rorre\rt, and also that the energy matrix Q is \rorre\rtly formulated.\nLarge Perturbation Results. For the large perturbation simulations, the initial transient energy is 10\n4\nE\n0\n,\n\rorresponding to an open-loop initial maximum ~v of approximately 10\n\u00002\nU\n\rl\n.\nOpen-Loop Non-Linear Simulation. The open-loop transient energy time history, from this larger initial\nperturbation, for both linear and non-linear simulations, is displayed in \fgure 16. The linear and non-\nlinear simulations agree initially for a period of non-normal growth up to time approximately 50 units.\nThereafter the linear simulation in\rreases to \romplete the non-normal growth to transient energy of 0:111,\n\rorresponding to an dia\rhroni\r transient energy bound of 4896:94, and then\re \rontinue with de\ray, but the\nnon-linear simulation rea\rhes a saturated state with peak transient energy of 0:0240 at time approximately\n124:5 units, and thereafter de\rays. The de\ray \rontinues beyond t = 1500 (not shown), at approximately\nthe same rate as at t = 1000. Although non-linear simulation soon deviates from the linear results, the\nearliest growth appears to be at a rate identi\ral to that of the linear system non-modal phase.\nRegarding estimation, \fgure 16 also shows the open-loop estimated transient energy against time. In\nthis \rase, the performan\re of the linear estimator on the non-linear plant model is poor, as it overshoots\nthe plant energy.\nLQR State Feedba\rk Non-Linear Simulation. Figure 17 presents the \rlosed-loop LQR transient energy\nversus time, from this larger initial perturbation, for both linear and non-linear simulations. The \rontroller\nredu\res the transient energy, and the di\u000beren\re between the linear and non-linear simulation is somewhat\nredu\red, as \rompared to the open-loop \rase. The \rontroller has redu\red the open-loop non-linear peak\ntransient energy from 0:024 to 0:0093, a redu\rtion of approximately 61% whi\rh is not nearly su\rh a great\nredu\rtion as that in linear simulation where the dia\rhroni\r transient energy bound falls approximately\n83%. The peak nonlinear LQR transient energy of 0:0093 is approximately half the linear value of 0:019.\nThe \rontroller is a\rheiving a lower energy density on the non-linear simulation, as energy levels are in\ngeneral lower in the non-linear simulation. The wall transpiration velo\rities required in the non-linear\nsimulation are \romparable with those in the linear one.\nMay 2, 2007 17:26 International Journal of Control ij\r\nJ. M\rkernan, J.F. Whidborne and G. Papadakis 21\nThe large perturbation CFD simulation for the LQR system showed poor agreement\nbetween the peak transient energy as \romputed from the states using X\nT\nQX from (19)\nand as \ral\rulated by dire\rt integration over the mesh using (9). The peak transient energy\nas \romputed from the states under estimates that from dire\rt integration by 44%. This is\nthought to be due to disturban\res at wave number pairs other than \u000b; \f being present at\npeak E in the non-linear magnitude CFD simulation.\nLQG Output Feedba\rk Non-Linear Simulation. Figure 18 shows the LQG transient energy versus time.\nThe linear \rontroller is unable to stabilize the non-linear plant model at this level of initial disturban\re.\nSin\re the LQR \rontroller is able to stabilise the test \rase at this energy level, the de\f\rien\ry appears to\nbe in the estimator, and indeed its behaviour is poor, as its estimated energy overshoots the plant energy\naround time 120, and diverges errati\rally from time 720 onwards. Sin\re an impli\rit method is employed, to\navoid sti\u000bness problems, the estimator integration s\rheme is guaranteed to be stable, and thus integration\ninstability is not the \rause of this errati\r behaviour.\nResults from a smaller initial disturban\re \rorresponding to an open-loop worst initial \rondition with\nv\nmax\n= 7:5 \u0002 10\n\u00003\nU\n\rl\n, i.e. energy of 5625E\n0\nare presented in \fgure 19. The linear \rontroller is able to\nstabilize the non-linear plant model at this smaller level of initial disturban\re, approximately half that of\nthe level whi\rh \rould not be stabilised. This time the estimated energy overshoots but does not diverge.\nThe transient energy is limited to 0:01, as \rompared to the open-loop plant whi\rh rea\rhes approximately\n0:04 (not shown).\n6.8 Summary of Simulation Results\nTable 3 show a summary of the linear and non-linear simulation results. At the perturbation sizes used\nhere, non-linear e\u000be\rts redu\re the energy of large perturbation simulations below the level of s\raled small\nperturbation results, with the ex\reption the LQG unstable large perturbation simulation.\n7 Con\rlusions\nThis paper has des\rribed the synthesis and validation of output and state feedba\rk optimal \rontrollers for\nplane Poiseuille \row, and has investigated aspe\rts of the transient energy growth of the \rontrolled and\nun\rontrolled systems.\nTuned pro\ress noise weights for the optimal estimator were \rhosen to re\re\rt the possible size variations\nin disturban\res a\rross the \rhannel, as an alternative to uniform weights and proved better at following the\nplant worst \rase initial \ronditions from zero initial estimates. Estimation required \fner model wall-normal\ndis\rretisation than state feedba\rk \rontrol required.\nRegarding feedba\rk \rontrol, although the sinusoidal transpiration was guaranteed to have a zero net \rux\nover whole streamwise or spanwise periods, and thus also over any time span, its magnitude was su\rh that\nat any parti\rular point the transpiration of \romparatively large quantities of \ruid were required. Controller\nimplementation s\rhemes mooted e.g. by (Ho and Tai, 1998) envisage the use of mi\rroele\rtri\ral ma\rhines\n(MEMs) based on small reservoirs, but these s\rhemes would appear unable to provide the quantities of\n\ruid required for optimal \rontrol of the test \rase based on early transition \ronsidered here.\nNon-linear simulations on linear sized perturbations reprodu\red the linear simulation results . The\noverall agreement between the linear spe\rtral results and the independent \fnite volume results at low\nMay 2, 2007 17:26 International Journal of Control ij\r\n22 REFERENCES\nlevels of disturban\re provides good eviden\re that both are \rorre\rt under these \ronditions. A non-linear\nsimulation of the open-loop plant from a large (non-linear sized, v\nmax\n= 10\n\u00002\nU\n\rl\n) worst initial perturbation\nshowed that the \row saturates but appears stable. Although the simulation soon deviates from the linear\nresults, initially they both grow at the non-normal rate of the linear simulations.\nA non-linear simulation of the plant with LQR state feedba\rk from a large worst initial perturbation\nagain saturates but remain stable. The state feedba\rk redu\res the peak transient energy below open-loop\nvalues. Thus the linear and non-linear results are \rloser than the open-loop results. The LQG \rontroller\nis unable to stabilise the non-linear plant at this level of initial perturbation. The estimator initially\nbehaves well, but overshoots and diverges, leading the \rontroller to destabilise the plant. From an initial\nperturbation of half this energy level, the estimator energy again overshoots the plant, but it does not\ndiverge, and the \rontrolled plant keeps the transient energy well below the open-loop value.\nThis study has not investigated the e\u000be\rts of un\rertainty su\rh as modelling errors, plant disturban\res\nand measurement noise, on \rlosed-loop performan\re. Although LQG \rontrol \rontains a spe\ri\f\r model for\ndisturban\res and noise, this model does not adequately address their un\rertainty (Zhou et al., 1996, p214).\nFurther study would require investigation of \rontroller robustness to modelling un\rertainty as performed\nby Bewley and Liu (1998) and Baramov et al.
