Purves,\u2217 Charles S. Adams, and Ifan G. Hughes\nDepartment of Physics, Durham University, South Road, Durham, DH1 3LE, UK.\n(Dated: February 2, 2008)\nWe use a Sagnac interferometer to measure the dispersive and absorptive properties of room\ntemperature Rubidium vapor on the D2 line at 780.2 nm. We apply a pump beam such that the\nresulting \u039b system exhibits Electromagnetically Induced Transparency. Using a \u201cbiased alignment\u201d\ntechnique we demonstrate a direct and robust method of measuring the rapid variation in the\nrefractive index. Such a \u201cslow-light\u201d Sagnac interferometer is ideally suited to precision measurement\napplications such as magnetometry and inertial sensing.\nPACS numbers: 42.50.Gy, 39.30.+w, 07.60.Ly, 32.30.-r\nSlow light is the propagation of light with a group ve-\nlocity significantly below the speed of light in a vacuum.\nSlow light propagation is observed in media whose re-\nfractive index varies rapidly with respect to frequency.\nThe rapid variation in the refractive index has a con-\ncomitant narrow transparent window in the spectrum of\nthe slow-light medium. Such narrow transmission win-\ndows can be produced using Electromagnetically Induced\nTransparency (EIT) in an atomic vapor [1, 2, 3]. Slow\nlight propagation has also been observed in solid-state\nmedia such as ruby [4] and optical fibers [5]. In gen-\neral EIT is an effect seen in three-level systems interact-\ning with two light fields [6, 7]. For slow light in atomic\nsystems, the three levels form a \u039b system with the two\nlower states being coupled to the common upper state\nby optical transitions. In the \u039b system the width of\nthe EIT resonance is ultimately limited by the coherence\ntime between the two lower energy states, which can be\nvery long, consequently resonances as narrow as tens of\nHz have been observed [8, 9]. Narrow resonances lend\nthemselves to being used as the basis for sensitive mea-\nsurements. For example, utilising the narrow linewidth of\nEIT resonances, it is possible to construct extremely com-\npact atomic clocks [10]. Magnetically sensitive \u039b systems\nenable the construction of compact and sensitive magne-\ntometers [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. It has also been proposed\nthat slow light could enhance the rotational sensitivity of\na Sagnac interferometer [16], to produce a hybrid optical\nmatter-wave Sagnac interferometer [17] \u2014 this scheme\nwould require laser cooled atoms to achieve the proposed\nmatter-wave sensitivity gain. The sensitivity of atomic\nsystems to inertial sensing is also highlighted in recent\nwork where an atomic magnetometer has been used to\nprovide precision measurements of rotations [18].\nIn this paper, we present measurements on a slow-light\nmedium in a Sagnac interferometer. We show that an ap-\npropriately configured slow-light Sagnac interferometer\nprovides a direct and robust readout of the dispersion.\nThe experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1(i). We study\n\u2217Electronic address: g.t.purves@dur.ac.uk;\nURL: http:\/\/massey.dur.ac.uk\/gtp\nthe 87Rb D2 line (5s\n2S 1\n2\nF = 1\u2192 5p 2P 3\n2\nF \u2032) using or-\nthogonal circular polarized pump and probe beams. For\na room temperature vapor, the pump and probe couple\nto three excited states, as depicted in Fig. 1(ii).\nThe degeneracy of the two Zeeman sub-levels within\nthe ground hyperfine state is lifted by applying a mag-\nnetic field of \u2243 1 G co-axial to the pump and probe\nbeams. This ensures that the two-photon resonance\n(\u03b4 = 0) does not coincide with the beat signal arising\nwhen the pump and probe have the same frequency.\nBoth pump and probe beams are derived from the same\nExtended Cavity Diode Laser (ECDL) and double-pass\nthrough separate Acousto-Optic Modulators (AOMs).\nThe ECDL is detuned by \u2206 from the F = 1 \u2192 F \u2032 = 2\nresonance. The pump beam is shifted by a fixed fre-\nquency offset, whereas the probe has a variable offset\nwhich is scanned about \u03b4 = 0, see Fig. 1(ii). The\nfrequency-shifted beams are recombined on a polariz-\ning beam splitter (PBS) and coupled through a sin-\ngle mode, polarization-preserving optical fiber ensur-\ning that the pump and probe beams are perfectly co-\npropagating. The output from the fiber is collimated\nand passes through two 50:50 beam splitters. The first\nbeam splitter is used to pick off one of the Sagnac out-\nputs. The loss associated with the first 50:50 beam split-\nter could be avoided by using polarization to pick off the\noutput beam [19], however this would prevent the use\nof orthogonally polarized pump and probe beams. The\nsecond beam splitter divides both pump and probe into\nthe two counter-propagating arms of the Sagnac inter-\nferometer, see Fig. 1(i). The beams within the Sagnac\ninterferometer all have circular Gaussian profiles, with\na full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) in the center of\nthe Rb vapor cell of around 2 mm. Either side of the\nRb cell, the orthogonal linear polarized beams are con-\nverted into circular polarizations by quarter-wave plates.\nThe beams pass through an 8 cm long Rb vapor cell,\nwhich is positioned centrally within a solenoid, inside a\ncylindrical \u00b5-metal shield. In the anticlockwise direction,\nthe pump beam is coupled out of the interferometer by\na PBS, before reaching the Rb cell. The two counter-\npropagating probe beams interfere on the second beam\nsplitter. Output arm A includes a neutral-density filter\nwhich transmits 50% of the light onto photodiode A. Arm\n2B propagates back towards the first beam splitter, where\n50% is reflected onto photodiode B.\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (i) Sagnac interferometer experimen-\ntal set-up. The probe beam (red\/dark-grey) passes around\nthe Sagnac interferometer in both clockwise and anticlockwise\ndirections, however the orthogonally polarized pump beam\n(orange\/light-grey) only passes through the Rubidium vapor\ncell in the clockwise direction.

(ii) The \u039b system investigated in this pa-\nper: \u2206 is the single-photon detuning of the pump field from\nthe atomic resonance; and \u03b4 is the detuning of the probe from\nthe two-photon Raman resonance. (iii) Output beam pro-\nfiles for \u201cperfect\u201d alignment (upper) and \u201cbiased\u201d alignment\n(lower), see text. The shaded rectangles show the positions\nof two mechanical slits.\nIn the case that the probe beams perfectly counter-\npropagate, (\u201cPerfect\u201d alignment, Fig. 1(iii)(upper)); arm\nA is dark (light grey\/light red), whilst arm B is bright\n(dark grey\/red). A change in the refractive index of the\nmedium for one direction of propagation shifts the fringe\npattern. However the sensitivity is minimal, as the shift\nis about a maxima or minima of the interference pattern,\nwhere the rate of change of intensity with displacement is\nlowest. To enhance the sensitivity we \u201cbias\u201d the interfer-\nometer by introducing a small angle between the counter-\npropagating beams [19, 20], such that both light and dark\nfringes appear in the interference pattern at both out-\nputs, Fig. 1(iii)(lower). Two mechanical slits aperture\nthe fringe pattern, such that only the region between the\nlight and dark fringe is focussed onto the photodiode.\nThis biasing technique enables one to obtain maximal\nsensitivity to changes in the refractive index and a sig-\nnal that is directly proportional to the refractive index\ndifference between the two counter-propagating probes.\nThe sum and difference signal between the two outputs\nare given by\nPA + PB\nP0\n\u221d\n(\ne\u2212\u03b1cL + e\u2212\u03b1aL\n)\n, (1)\nPA \u2212 PB\nP0\n\u221d e\u2212\u03b1L sin (kL\u2206n) , (2)\nwhere PA, PB and P0 quantify the power in arms A, B\nand the total power into the interferometer, respectively;\n\u03b1c and \u03b1a are the absorption coefficients for the clockwise\nand anticlockwise beams, respectively; \u03b1 = (\u03b1c + \u03b1a) \/2;\nL is the length of the Rb vapor cell; and \u2206n is the dif-\nference in refractive index between the clockwise and an-\nticlockwise beams. It should be noted that |kL\u2206n| \u226a 1,\nhence sin(kL\u2206n) \u2243 kL\u2206n, i.e. the difference signal can\nbe taken to be directly proportional to \u2206n. Finally, as\nonly the clockwise probe beam co-propagates with the\npump beam within the vapor cell, only the clockwise\nprobe beam experiences a narrow EIT feature, hence \u2206n\nis equal to the refractive index of the EIT feature alone.\nThus the difference between the two output arms of the\nSagnac interferometer is directly proportional to the dis-\npersion associated with the EIT feature.\nCompared to a Mach-Zehnder interferometer [21, 22],\nthe Sagnac interferometer provides a more robust tool for\nmeasuring EIT dispersion features. In both interferome-\nters it is necessary that the beam paths of the two arms\nshould be close to equal. This is trivial in the Sagnac,\nas both arms of the interferometer follow the same path\nbut in opposite directions, whereas in the Mach-Zehnder\nthe path length of the two independent arms must be\nmatched (requiring a piezoelectric transducer to control\nof the length of one of the two arms [22]). In addition\nthe Sagnac interferometer provides a degree of common-\nmode rejection against translational mirror vibrations.\nTo ascertain at which value of laser detuning, \u2206, the\nfeatures are strongest, a double-scanning technique was\nused [23, 24]. \u2206 is scanned over the full Doppler broad-\nened transition once, whilst at the same time, the two-\nphoton detuning \u03b4\/2pi, is scanned m times over a range\nof several hundreds of kHz with the AOM [23, 24]. This\nleads to m EIT features occurring within the range of\nthe Doppler broadened transition Fig. 2. The frequency\nscale of such a plot is not straight forward, the centers of\nthe different EIT features are separated by a frequency\ngiven by the ECDL scan \u2206\/2pi whilst the width of the\nfeatures is determined by the AOM scan \u03b4\/2pi. The am-\nplitude of the EIT signals are determined by a Gaussian\nenvelope. This is expected, as the number of atoms that\ncontribute to the EIT signal across the Doppler broad-\nened resonance can be closely approximated by a Gaus-\nsian function. Scanning two counter-propagating beams\nat the same frequency across the Doppler broadened res-\nonance leads to the occurrence of saturation spectroscopy\nresonances [25, 26]. The features most prominent in Fig.\n2 occur at frequencies of approximately 0 MHz, \u221280 MHz\nand \u2212160 MHz, consistent with the known hyperfine\nstructure.\n3FIG. 2: (Color online) Sum (i) and difference (ii) of the\noutput arms of the Sagnac interferometer. The red (light-\ngrey) trace shows unsmoothed data, the blue (dark-grey)\ntrace shows the data with a nineteen point running average.\nThe probe beam power is 4 \u00b5W, the pump beam power is\n26 \u00b5W. The piezo is used to scan both pump and probe fields\nover a range of 1.3 GHz whilst the AOM scans the probe\nfield twelve times, over a range of 1.8 MHz, about the two-\nphoton Raman resonance. The frequency scale applies only\nto the piezo scan. When the Raman resonance condition is\nmet, there is a sharp increase in transmission and a concomi-\ntant rapid change in the refractive index. The signals in both\nplots are normalised such that the sum of the signals in the\ntwo arms, away from the Doppler resonance, is equal to one.\nThe Doppler broadened background has been subtracted from\nboth signals.\nIn order to characterize both the transmission and\ndispersion of the EIT feature, the ECDL was tuned to\nthe center of the Doppler broadened transition, between\n\u2212100 and \u2212200 MHz in Fig. 2. The probe alone was\nthen scanned across the two-photon Raman resonance.\nThe signals from the two output arms, A and B, were\nrecorded, both with and without the pump field. The\nprobe-only signal was subtracted from the probe-and-\npump signal, this removed varying background due to the\nscanning of the AOM. Plots of the two individual arms of\na typical signal can be seen in Fig. 3(i). The signal is nor-\nmalised to the off-resonance sum of the two output arms,\nand then the background is subtracted. The difference\nsignal, PA \u2212 PB (Eq. (2)), giving the refractive index of\nthe EIT feature, is shown in Fig. 3(ii). The sum Eq. (1),\nwhich is proportional to the transmission of the EIT reso-\nFIG. 3: (Color online) The EIT feature as measured in the\nSagnac interferometer. The probe power is 3 \u00b5W and the\npump power is 28 \u00b5W. The signal size is normalised to the\nsum of the off resonance signal in both arms. The background\nsignal has been subtracted from each arm after normalisa-\ntion.

Along with the sum signal\ndata are two least-square fits, a Lorentzian and a cusp\nfunction (two back-to-back exponentials). Both functions\nare fitted to the data across the frequency range shown\nin the figure. If the signals are power broadened, the\nbeam profile affects the line shape and width of the reso-\nnance [27]: a step-like beam profile leads to a Lorentzian\nline shape and a Gaussian beam profile to an arctan line\nshape. In this case the FWHM varies linearly with the\nintensity of the beam, Fig. 4. The cusp function gives the\nexpected line shape for transit-time dominated broaden-\ning [28], and is virtually indistinguishable from the arctan\nfit [27].\nFor the parameters used in this work, the EIT reso-\n4FIG. 4: Plot of the FWHM of a Lorentzian dispersion fit to\nthe difference signal for a range of pump powers. Experimen-\ntal data (circles) with a linear fit (solid line).\nnance is power broadened. The amplitude of the features\nincreases with pump power until it starts to saturate\nat around 50 \u00b5W. Reducing the intensity of the pump\nreduces the width of the resonances, as can be seen in\nFig. 4. Extrapolating the linear fit of Fig. 4, shows that\nreducing the pump power to zero will lead to a FWHM\nof 170 kHz, where the probe power is 4 \u00b5W. Whilst this\nis more than forty times narrower than the excited state\nlinewidth, even narrower resonances could be obtained\nusing a buffer gas to extend the interaction time [8, 9].\nFor example by increasing the beam size by a factor of\ntwo we obtain resonance widths of 70 kHz. A larger beam\nsize has a two-fold benefit: the intensity is reduced and\nthe transit time of atoms through the pump beam is in-\ncreased \u2014 leading to reduced transit time broadening.\nIn summary, a Sagnac interferometer has been realised\nincorporating a slow-light medium. We show that one\ncan \u201cbias\u201d the interferometer to provide a direct and ro-\nbust readout of the dispersion associated with narrow\nEIT resonances. Using this technique Sagnac interfer-\nometry provides a modulation-free method of producing\na signal with potential applications in magnetometry and\ninertial sensing.\nAcknowledgments\nGraham Purves\u2019s PhD studentship was provided by\nEPSRC. the authors would like to thank M.
