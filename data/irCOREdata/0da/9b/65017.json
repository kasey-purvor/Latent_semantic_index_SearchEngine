Nondestructive analysis of senescence in mesophyll cells by spectral resolution of protein synthesis-dependent pigment metabolism ?New Phytologist, 179, (3), pp. 663-674 IMPF: 05.18 RONO: 1310 3001Over 6 d of dark-induced senescence, leaf segments of wild-type Lolium temulentum lost > 96% chlorophyll a + b; leaves from plants containing a staygreen mutation introgressed from Festuca pratensis, which has a lesion in the senescence-associated fragmentation of pigment-proteolipid complexes, retained over 43% of total chlorophyll over the same period. Mutant segments preferentially retained thylakoid membrane proteins (exemplified by LHCP II) but lost other cellular proteins at the same rate as wild-type tissue. The protein synthesis inhibitor D-MDMP inhibited chlorophyll degradation and partially prevented protein loss in both genotypes, but tissues treated with the ineffective L-stereoisomer were indistinguishable from water controls.

During mesophyll\nsenescence, chloroplasts transdifferentiate into gerontoplasts,\na type of organelle which should be considered not as damaged\nor disorganized, but as a developmental stage in the plastid\nlife cycle (Thomas et al., 2003). Diagnostic of the chloroplast-\nto-gerontoplast transition is induction of the pathway of\nchlorophyll (chl) catabolism (Thomas et al., 2001; Ougham\net al., in press). Most of the enzymes and corresponding genes\nfor chlorophyll catabolism have been identified in recent years\n(Kr\u00e4utler & H\u00f6rtensteiner, 2006; Tanaka & Tanaka, 2006;\nOugham et al., in press). This pathway is sensitive to interruption\nby genetic mutation and chemical treatments (Thomas &\nHowarth, 2000; Ougham et al., in press). Previously we\ndescribed the introgression of a mutant (staygreen) allele into\nLolium temulentum L. from Festuca pratensis Huds. (Thomas\nNew Phytologist (2008) 179: 663\u2013674 www.newphytologist.org \u00a9 The Authors (2008). Journal compilation \u00a9 New Phytologist (2008)\nResearch664\net al., 1999). Opening of the tetrapyrrole macrocycle is\ndisabled in staygreen mutants of this type and hence they\nretain the majority of their chl during senescence (Roca et al.,\n2004). It has long been known that senescence is also sensitive\nto inhibitors of gene expression, particularly chemicals that\ndisrupt protein synthesis on cytoplasmic ribosomes (Thomas\n& Stoddart, 1980). In the present study, we used MDMP, a\nstereospecific inhibitor of eukaryotic translation (Baxter et al.,\n1973) and leaf senescence (Thomas, 1976).\nIntroducing blockages into the chl breakdown pathway causes\ncharacteristic changes in the pools of upstream intermediates\n(Roca et al., 2004; Ougham et al., in press), which in turn would\nbe expected to change the spectral properties of the tissue. There\nis an extensive literature on the reflectance properties of leaves,\nmuch of it relating to large-scale remote sensing of vegetation\n(Merzlyak et al., 1999; Richardson et al., 2002; Sims & Gamon,\n2002; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2005). To observe and classify subtle\ncompositional changes resulting from genetic or chemical\ninterruption of chlorophyll degradation, we used a combination\nof spectral data collection and chemometric analysis.\nSpectral data sets can be highly informative of the state of\nthe object, but are usually very large and need to be analysed\nby the appropriate multivariate and machine-learning methods\nto extract meaningful information from them and to take\naccount of features such as multicollinearity (Mitchell, 1997;\nManly, 2000; Naes et al., 2004; Witten & Frank, 2005; Bishop,\n2006). In the present study, we analyse the compositional\nconsequences for L. temulentum senescence of introducing a\nstaygreen mutation or MDMP treatment, or both, and relate\nthese to the spectral properties of leaf tissue determined\nnondestructively and analysed by multivariate methods.\nMaterials and Methods\nPlant material\nWild-type (Y) and staygreen (G) lines of Lolium temulentum\nCeres, near isogenic for an introgression from a senescence mutant\nof Festuca pratensis, were generated as described by Thomas\net al. (1999). Plants were grown from seed on vermiculite, seven\nplants per 5 inch pot, in a controlled environment providing\na constant 20\u00b0C and 8 : 16 h light : dark cycle (light flux\n350 \u00b5mol m\u22122 s\u22121). Plants were fed with a nutrient solution as\ndescribed by Gay & Hauck (1994).\nTreatments\nTissue was harvested from the fully expanded youngest (fourth)\nleaf 5\u20136 wk after seed sowing. Laminae were cut into 3 cm\nlengths and surface-sterilized by immersion for 5 min in 1.2%\nsodium hypochlorite solution containing four drops of Tween\n20 per 250 ml followed by thorough rinsing with five changes\nof sterile water. Segments were incubated under aseptic\nconditions at 20\u00b0C in continuous darkness by floating\nthem lower side down on water, 10 \u00b5m L-MDMP or 10 \u00b5m\nD-MDMP in 9-cm-diameter Petri dishes (usually seven segments\nper dish). The stereoisomers of MDMP (2-(4-methyl-2,6-\ndinitroanilino)-N-methyl-propionamide; Baxter et al., 1973)\nwere chemically synthesized by Dr Richard Simmonds,\nAberystwyth University. Freshly harvested tissue was used for\n0 d samples. At 2, 4 and 6 d, control and MDMP-treated\nsegments were rinsed with distilled water and, to avoid\ncontributions from injured cells at cut surfaces, 2\u20133 mm of\ntissue at each end of each segment was discarded. Leaf segments\nwere scanned for reflectance spectra as described in the following\nsections. Tissue for extraction was weighed, immediately\nfrozen in liquid N2 and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for later analysis.\nRecording and multivariate analysis of spectral data\nOptical reflectance spectra of the leaf samples were obtained\nusing an ImSpector direct sight imaging spectrograph (Spectral\nImaging Ltd, Oulu, Finland). This is a passive optical device\nthat, when interposed between a camera and a lens, permits\nacquisition of an individual spectrum at pixel resolution along\na linear slice through the field of view. This results in an image\nin which the horizontal axis represents displacement along\nthat line and the vertical axis corresponds to wavelength; each\npixel in this image therefore represents the reflected intensity\nat a specific wavelength at a specific location on a line across\nthe current sample. The ImSpector used was type V9, which\nhas a nominal spectral range of 430\u2013900 nm but this is subject\nto modification by the spectral characteristics of the camera\nused and the geometry of the ImSpector\/camera combination.\nFor the present study, the ImSpector was attached to the\nC-mount of a Hitachi KP-M1EK monochrome CCD video\ncamera with AGC (automatic gain control) disabled and gamma\ncorrection set to 1.0. The optical IR-cut filter fitted in front\nof the CCD in the camera was removed and this extended the\nspectral response from the normal cutoff of 700 nm towards\nthe infrared. Wavelength calibration of the ImSpector\/camera\ncombination was effected with a mercury vapour lamp, aided\nby coloured LEDs to resolve possible ambiguity in identifying\nthe mercury lines. This revealed that the effective spectral\nrange was approx. 461\u2013854 nm. A linear least-squares fit was\napplied to the relationship between pixel number on the\nspectral axis and mercury line wavelength (r2 = 0.999, with\nno improvement using a quadratic fit). This was used to\nprovide the following empirical wavelength calibration, where\nwavelength is in nm and \u2018pixel\u2019 refers to pixel number on the\nspectral axis in the range 1\u2013260:\nWavelength = (pixel \u00d7 1.51) + 461.65 Eqn 1\nImage capture was via a desktop personal computer fitted\nwith a low-cost video capture card. Illumination was by means\nof two 12 V quartz-halogen lamps. Acquired images were in\nthe form of raw binary files that were unpacked by means of\n\u00a9 The Authors (2008).

Lens aperture, exposure time and lighting were\nall kept constant throughout and data were recorded with\nnominal 8 bit intensity resolution, but maximum values\nwere restricted to 7 bit resolution to avoid any possibility of\nsaturation. Initial checks were made for the presence of any\nanomalous extra bright pixels in the leaf regions of the images\n(see later for definition) by calculating the ratio of mean to\nmedian reflectance, and as this only varied between 0.95 and\n1.01, the absence of extra-bright pixels was confirmed.\nInitial observations showed that there was a slight difference\nin illumination across the field of view (\u00b11%), so to reduce\nsystematic bias an average was taken over the illuminated leaf\nsurface at each wavelength, containing 200 separate pixels on\nthe spatial axis from the same part of the field of view for each\nsample. The ratio of the leaf value to that of the mean of two\n60-pixel-wide regions on the spatial axis of the background\npaper on either side of the leaf (taken far enough away from\nthe leaf to avoid direct shadows, and from fixed regions in the\nfield of view) was then calculated, thus ensuring that the\ncomparison between samples was unaffected by the slightly\nuneven illumination. Values were finally corrected to a known\nreflectance of substandard (Spectralon\u00ae, Labsphere Inc., North\nSutton, NH, USA), which had previously been compared\nwith the background paper. This procedure also accounted for\nthe changes in the relative sensitivity of the ImSpector\/camera\ncombination with wavelength. For each group of five leaves,\nsingle spectra were produced for their upper and lower sur-\nfaces, and named according to genotype, days of senescence,\nchemical treatment and whether the upper or lower leaf\nsurface was scanned. For tissue incubated on water or\nMDMP for 2, 4, 6 and 8 d, this gave four time points \u00d7 two\nsurfaces \u00d7 two genotypes \u00d7 two treatments = 32 data objects.\nFor 0 d (unsenesced) tissue, observations were made on two\nsurfaces \u00d7 two genotypes = four data objects, making a total\nof 36 data objects, each with 260 spectral variables.\nTo investigate whether the spectra were able to distinguish\nthe different groups, principal-components analysis (PCA,\nHotelling, 1933) was applied to the set of 36 spectra, after\nscaling values at each wavelength to zero mean and unit\nvariance, using MATLAB 7 (The MathWorks Ltd, Natick,\nMA, USA). The first six principal components were found\nto account for 70.36, 10.77, 5.45, 2.72, 1.54 and 1.34%,\nrespectively, of the variance in the data.\nLeaf colour was quantified by pixel analysis of high-resolution\nJPEG images of leaf segments. RGB (red-green-blue) profiles\nacross a montage of segments were obtained using the \u2018improfile\u2019\ntool in MATLAB.\nProtein extraction and electrophoresis\nFrozen leaf material was ground to a fine powder with\nliquid N2 and sand, in a mortar and pestle. The powder was\nhomogenized with 5 ml g\u22121 FW extraction buffer (EB)\ncomprising 0.2 mm tris, pH 8.0, containing 5% (v\/v) glycerol,\n1% (v\/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF and 1 mm\nmonoiodoacetate, and allowed to thaw before adding 20%\n(w\/v) lithium dodecyl sulphate (LiDS; 0.5 ml g\u22121 FW) and\nhomogenizing further. The homogenate was heat-denatured\nby boiling for 2 min, cooled and centrifuged at 12 500 gav for\n10 min. Protein in the supernatant was determined according\nto Lowry et al. (1951). Total LiDS-EB-extracted proteins were\nfractionated by 12.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\n(SDS-PAGE; Laemmli, 1970) using a Bio-Rad mini-gel system.\nAliquots of extracts were loaded on the basis of equal weight of\nleaf tissue. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.\nHigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) \nof leaf pigments\nLeaf segments were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to\na fine powder in a pestle and mortar with quartz sand. The\npigments were extracted with 80% acetone (1.5 ml per 100 mg\ntissue) and, after centrifugation at 10 000 gav for 10 min at\n4\u00b0C, chlorophylls and related pigments were determined by\nHPLC (Roca et al., 2004). Pigments were identified from their\nspectral absorption maxima and peak ratios and by HPLC\ncochromatography with authentic samples. Identification of\n132 hydroxy chlorophyllide a is tentative, based on spectral\nabsorption maxima and peak ratios. Online UV-visible spectra\nwere recorded from 350\u2013700 nm with a photodiode array\ndetector. HPLC was performed on a Nova-Pak C18 4 \u00b5m\nRadial-Pak cartridge 8 mm \u00d7 100 mm column using Waters\n515 HPLC pumps and a Waters model 996 photodiode array\ndetector. The manual injection valve (Rheodyne, model 7725I)\nwas fitted with a 20 \u00b5l loop. Separation was carried out using\nan elution gradient (2 ml min\u22121) with the mobile phases (A)\nion pair reagent\/methanol (1 : 4 v\/v) and (B) acetone\/methanol\n(1 : 4 v\/v). The ion pair reagent was 1 m ammonium acetate\nin water (Langmeier et al., 1993). The gradient was isocratic\nA 4 min, A to B 5 min, isocratic B 9 min, return to A 2 min\n(Siefermann-Harms, 1987), and detection was at 660 nm.\nAnalytically pure samples of chl a and chl b were used to obtain\nthe calibration slopes representing the area of the peak\nobtained with different injected volumes of pure solutions of\nknown concentration. The same preparation was acidified\nand used for calibration with regard to phaeophorbides (phd).\nFor quantification of chlorophyllides (chld) it was assumed\nthat dephytylation does not change the spectral properties of\nthe porphyrin moiety (Langmeier et al., 1993).\nResults\nSenescence and its response to D- and L-MDMP\nRetention of chl is an intrinsic character of the foliage of\nstaygreen L. temulentum genotypes, expressed under every\nNew Phytologist (2008) 179: 663\u2013674 www.newphytologist.org \u00a9 The Authors (2008).

Over the same timescale,\ntissue of the line carrying the staygreen introgression remained\ngreen, although the eye was able to discern some fading and\nslight changes in leaf colour from bright to olive green. Leaf\nsegments treated with L-MDMP had a similar appearance\nto those incubated on water; but the D-stereoisomer of\nMDMP which, unlike L-, is a potent inhibitor of cytosolic\nprotein synthesis, prevented visible degreening in Y tissue.\nD-MDMP also inhibited the subtle pigmentation changes in\nG leaf segments.\nPigments in MDMP-treated tissue\nChlorophylls and related pigments were analysed by HPLC.\nOnly chl a and chl b were detected in Y tissue at each time-point\nand treatment (Table 1, Fig. 2). In the G genotype, chld a\nappeared at day 2, increased further by day 4 and declined\nsomewhat at day 6 (Table 1). From day 4 other chl derivatives\nbegan to appear, including allomers and hydroxylated forms\nof chld a and phd a (Fig. 2, Table 1). No derivatives of chl b\nwere detected.

Over 6 d dark incubation, most of\nthe protein was lost from tissues of both genotypes, but from\n2 d onward, G segments retained significantly more protein\nthan those of Y at each assay point. L-MDMP-treated tissues\nbehaved like water controls (Fig. 3a,b). D-MDMP partially\nprevented protein loss from Y segments (Fig. 3a). In the G\ngenotype, only at day 6 was protein content in D-MDMP-treated\nsamples significantly higher than control and L-MDMP\ntreatments (Fig. 3b).\nThe corresponding gel separations are presented in\nFig. 3(c,d). Based on many previous studies of Lolium and\nFestuca leaf proteins, correlating total protein patterns with\nimmunoblots, the identities of major components can be\nassigned. The most prominent polypeptide is a densely stained\nband at c. 50 kDa, corresponding to the large subunit of\nrubisco. The rubisco small subunit, c. 18 kDa, is also abundant\nin 0 d samples. The light-harvesting proteins of photosystem\nII (LHCP II) are represented by a tight group of polypeptides\nat c. 24 kDa. The behaviour of rubisco and LHCP II is indicative\nof the general state of stroma and intrinsic thylakoid membrane\nproteins, respectively. In control and L-MDMP treatments of\nboth genotypes, the staining intensity of the rubisco bands\ndecreased in step with total protein. In both genotypes, rubisco\nsubunits were relatively stable over 4 d of treatment with\nD-MDMP, but the staining intensity of the corresponding\nbands had decreased sharply by 6 d. D-MDMP also stabilized\nthe amounts of a component of c. 65 kDa, running just above\nthe rubisco large subunit. LHCP II polypeptides were\nappreciably less labile in control and L-MDMP-treated G than\nin wild-type samples.

Discrimination between\ngenotypes and incubation times was achieved by plotting the\nfirst two principal components (Fig. 4). In each case, spectra\nfrom the upper and lower surfaces of the same sample were\nhighly similar, effectively behaving as replicates and demonstrating\nthe reproducibility of the data. The time series for each\ngenotype described a trajectory through PC space (indicated\nby arrows in Fig. 4a). Tissue of both genotypes at 0 d clustered\nin the region of the plot defined by a PC1 score of between\n\u22125 and \u221210 and a PC2 value c. \u22125. As Y tissue senesced, the\nPC1 score markedly increased towards 30, whereas PC2\nincreased by only a small amount. By contrast, senescence of\ntissue of the G mutant between 0 and 6 d was associated with\na large increase in PC2 value and a relatively small decrease in\nPC1. Between 6 and 8 d there was a decrease in PC2 score and\nan increase in PC1.\nFigure 5 shows the eigenvector coefficients (the weighting\nmultipliers applied to the individual wavelength values before\nsummation over all wavelengths to give a principal component\nvalue for a sample) for PC1, PC2 and PC3, which account for\n> 85% of data variance. The weightings for PC1 largely\ncontrast the reflectance in the 500\u2013720 nm range (the blue-green\nthrough to the red part of the spectrum) with that below\n500 nm (blue) and over 740 nm (near infra red). PC2 generally\nweights reflectance positively over all wavelengths, but with\na negative contribution between 720 and 740 nm, which is\ncoincident with the red edge where reflectance is changing\nrapidly between low values in the visible region and high\nvalues in the near-infrared. PC3 positively weights reflectances\nbelow 560 nm (the green and blue end of the spectrum) and\nprovides almost a mirror image of the weightings of PC2 near\nto the red edge, whilst giving negative weights in other spectral\nregions. This complex combination of both narrow and wide\nbands within the principal components demonstrates the\nimportance of collecting well resolved spectral information\nto discriminate between the wild-type, mutant and inhibitor-\ntreated leaves.\nInhibiting protein synthesis \u2018freezes\u2019 tissue in the \npresenescent state\nTreatment of Y and G tissue with D-MDMP strongly interfered\nwith the trajectories in the PCA plot (Fig. 4b). D-MDMP-\ntreated samples clustered in the region of control 0 and 2 d\nsamples, although by 6 d D-MDMP-exposed tissues of both\ngenotypes had become slightly separated from the remainder.\nDifference reflectance spectra were generated between combinations\nof time-points, treatments and genotypes. A set of difference\nspectra is presented in Fig. 6(a), illustrating the similarity\nbetween the 6 d D-MDMP samples and the 0 d samples, as\nindicated by the Y6M minus Y0 line. Accordingly, the difference\nspectrum for Y control at day 6 compared with Y at day 0 was\npractically identical to that of Y day 6 control against day 6\nD-MDMP-treated. The strong double peak at 645 and\n680 nm observed when comparing 6 d senesced Y leaves with\nunsenesced or D-MDMP-treated Y leaves primarily represents\nthe loss of chl a and b. D-MDMP blocked all the spectral\nchanges associated with senescence, illustrating the dependence\nof the earlier steps in chl degradation on protein synthesis.\nRelating difference spectra to pigment composition \nin senescing tissue\nFigure 6(b) presents a comparison between 6 d senesced and\nunsenesced G leaves.

To visualize this,\nwe carried out an analysis of relative RGB values of pixels in\nJPEG images of leaf segments (Fig. 1). Figure 7 presents\nthe results of scans across groups of G segments arranged\nby replicate (three per time point), days of senescence and\ncontrol or D-MDMP treatment. It is clear that the intensity\nof green relative to red decreased markedly between 0 and 6 d\nin control tissue. The convergence of red and green values\nwas completely prevented by D-MDMP treatment over the\nsame timescale.\nDiscussion\nDifferential sensitivities to MDMP of components of \nthe senescence syndrome\nPrevious publications on Brassica rapa (Ginsburg & Matile,\n1993) and L. temulentum (Roca et al., 2004) have shown that\nthe mechanism of chl catabolism and chl-associated protein\ndegradation during senescence of isolated leaf tissue is essentially\nidentical to that of intact leaves. Accordingly, from comparisons\nof pigment metabolism in leaf segments of G and Y\nL. temulentum, the process of chlorophyll and pigment-protein\nbreakdown in all modes of leaf senescence may be inferred.\nThis approach has been employed to separate out those\nparts of the senescence syndrome that require new proteins to\nbe made. MDMP was originally synthesized at Shell Research\nLtd as a putative herbicide. Baxter et al. (1973) reported that\nit is a potent inhibitor of the function of 80S (cytosolic)\nribosomes. Thomas (1976) showed that the D-stereoisomer\nblocked protein synthesis, total chlorophyll degradation,\nribonuclease activation and the decline in phosphogycerokinase\nin senescing segments of F. pratensis leaves. Tissue treated with\nthe L-isomer was indistinguishable from the water control. The\npresent study confirms and extends these early observations.\nChlorophyll a and chl b were almost completely degraded\nin segments of Y Lolium incubated on water or L-MDMP for\n6 d in the dark (Table 1). D-MDMP was highly effective in\npreventing loss of the pigments, superficially maintaining\nan unchanged presenescent greenness even in 6 d-senesced\nsegments (Table 1, Fig. 2). Figure 3(a,b) also confirm the\nobservation of Thomas (1976) and Thomas & Smart (1993)\nthat D-MDMP is only partially effective in blocking the\nloss of total protein, and rubisco in particular. The staygreen\nmutation introgressed into L. temulentum from F. pratensis has\nbeen shown to have only a small stabilizing effect on rubisco\nprotein (Thomas et al., 1999) and function (Hauck et al.,\n1997) during senescence.

Despite many years of investigation, the\nbiochemical basis and control of protein mobilization in\nsenescing leaf cells is still incompletely understood (H\u00f6rtensteiner\n& Feller, 2002; Feller et al., 2007). The present results indicate\nthat different proteins may be degraded by different proteolytic\npathways, some of which are newly made during senescence\nwhile others are constitutive or regulated post-translationally\n(Sullivan et al., 2003; Hopkins et al., 2007; Wingler, 2007).\nChlorophyll degradation in senescing leaf cells\nThe response of the chl of G segments to MDMP treatment\nraises questions concerning the mechanism of pigment\ndegradation during senescence. Vicentini et al. (1995) observed\nthat G Festuca has a deficiency in the activity of PaO, the\nenzyme responsible for opening the macrocycle of chl and\ndestroying the green colour. Subsequently, it was shown that\nthe staygreen introgression line of L. temulentum retains a\nbasal level of PaO activity and accumulates essentially normal\namounts of PaO protein during senescence (Roca et al., 2004;\nOugham et al., in press). Armstead et al. (2006, 2007) cloned\nthe staygreen locus and showed it was a gene of unknown\nfunction with no similarity to PaO. The evidence points to a\nrole in dismantling chlorophyll-protein complexes, with the\nindirect consequence of modulating PaO activity (Armstead\net al., 2006; Park et al., 2007). The staygreen gene is not expressed\nbefore senescence is initiated and it is likely that D-MDMP\nand other protein synthesis inhibitors check yellowing by\npreventing the senescence-specific de novo synthesis of this\ncritical protein. This cannot be the only point at which inhibitors\nact on chlorophyll metabolism in senescence, however. A\nconsequence of the metabolic block at staygreen\/PaO is\nthat upstream intermediates in the pathway accumulate in\nsenescing staygreen tissues (Thomas et al., 1989; Roca et al.,\n2004, Table 1). It was shown previously (Thomas et al., 1989)\nthat cycloheximide inhibits this accumulation. D-MDMP has\na similar effect (Fig. 2). Since neither chlorophyllase nor the\nMg-dechelating activity, which converts chl a to phaeophorbide\na, is sensitive to inhibition of protein synthesis, the existence\nof another, as yet unidentified, component of the chl catabolism\npathway (perhaps some kind of pigment transporter) is\nhypothesized (Matile et al., 1999). On the other hand, Table 1\nsuggests a possible alternative source of inhibitor-sensitive\nphd accumulation in staygreen tissues. Chl b is comparatively\nunstable in the mutant, as the marked increase in a : b ratio\nFig. 7 Profiles of red-green-blue (RGB) \npixel values obtained by scanning JPEG \nimages of G leaf segments treated with \nwater or D-MDMP.\nNew Phytologist (2008) 179: 663\u2013674 www.newphytologist.org \u00a9 The Authors (2008). Journal compilation \u00a9 New Phytologist (2008)\nResearch672\nduring senescence testifies. D-MDMP is highly effective in\npreventing chl b loss. It is well established that chl b is degraded\nby the PaO route after first being converted to phd a (Matile\net al., 1999). Scheumann et al. (1999) described a chl b-to-a\nconversion activity in barley that is up-regulated in senescence,\nand the gene for the corresponding reductase has recently been\ncloned (Kusaba et al., 2007). If, as seems likely, this activation\nis sensitive to protein synthesis inhibition, it may explain phd\naccumulation in terms of de novo conversion of chl (or chld) b\nto chld a, followed by Mg dechelation. Chl a, by contrast, is\nmuch less labile than chl b in the mutant (Table 1). This may\nreflect differences in the accessibilities of chl a and b to com-\nponents of the catabolic system invading the thylakoid membrane.\nNondestructive analysis of pigment metabolism in \nsenescing mesophyll cells\nA direct sight imaging spectrograph has been used to\nrecord, at pixel resolution, visible differences in L. temulentum\nsenescence genotypes and responses to MDMP treatment.\nThe instrument generates large amounts of data. After\nappropriate corrections for background, illumination and\nspectrograph sensitivity, data complexity was reduced by carrying\nout PCA. The first five principal components accounted for\nmore than 91% of the variance. Observations that behave\nsimilarly were grouped by plotting PC1 against PC2 (Fig. 4).\nThe effect of introducing the F. pratensis G gene into the\nL. temulentum background is to change the trajectory of\nspectral reflectance through PC space (Fig. 4a). The large\nmovements between days 4 and 6, and 6 and 8 in PC1\/PC2\nplots of G tissue demonstrate clearly that the mutation does\nnot disable physiological processes leading to detectable spectral\nchanges. After long incubations (6 d), both G and Y show a\nmarked change in the direction of travel in PC data space. We\nbelieve that this is indicative of senescence being overtaken\nby programmed or pathological cell death. Blocking protein\nsynthesis by treating with D-MDMP is effective in immobilizing\nthe condition of the tissue at, or close to, the presenescent\nstate (Fig. 4b), although some catabolic processes (e.g. Rubisco\ndegradation) partially escape inhibition (Fig. 3). These\nobservations reinforce the view that senescence is a combination\nof regulatory mechanisms acting at different points in the\nsequence of transcriptional, translational and post-translational\nevents (Wingler, 2007; Jansson & Thomas, in press). Difference\nspectra (Fig. 6) give insights into the nature of the pigmentation\nchanges occurring during senescence, and the compositional\nconsequences of altered chlorophyll catabolism in the mutant.\nNote that the ordinate values are not directly comparable\nbetween Fig. 6(a) and (b) because data were autoscaled for\nplotting. The spectral properties of phd, which accumulates at\nthe blockage point in the chlorophyll catabolism pathway in\nG (Roca et al., 2004, Fig. 2), correspond to the reflectance\nsignature of day 6 vs day 0 G. A blue shift of 10\u201315 nm is\nconsistent with known differences in the properties of pigments\nmeasured in vivo and in vitro (R\u00f6der et al., 2000; Zucchelli\net al., 2002). MDMP treatment confirms that development\nof the presumptive phd signature in vivo is protein synthesis-\ndependent (Fig. 6b), as revealed by HPLC analysis of pigment\nextracts (Fig. 2). Corresponding changes in the balance between\nred and green reflectance are readily detected by analysis\nof RGB pixel values in photographic or scanned images\n(Figs 1, 7) and could be the basis of a simple high-throughput\nscreening method.\nThe senescing mesophyll cell \u2013 a suitable case for \nsystems biology treatment\nMesophyll cell senescence has a number of features that make\nit a particularly appropriate subject for detailed molecular and\nphysiological analysis. It occurs in post-mitotic, nongrowing\ntissue and so quantification of activities is not bedevilled by\nchanging baselines. The cells in a given volume of mesophyll\nare well synchronized and the most important cellular and\nmolecular events occurring in excised tissue incubated in vitro\nare qualitatively the same as those occurring in intact organs\nand plants (Ginsburg & Matile, 1993; Roca et al., 2004).\nSenescence is self-reporting through pigmentation changes\n(Fig. 1) and, as shown here and in other studies using, for\nexample, chlorophyll fluorescence (Wingler et al., 2004), can\nbe probed noninvasively to reveal the state of diagnostic\nmetabolic pathways. Experimentally induced senescence is a\nterminal process of development expressed under conditions\nin which the environmental inputs that drive growth and\nbiosynthesis can be excluded. Consequently, the important\nmetabolic sequences are strongly one-way (catabolic) and\nindividual reaction steps are effectively irreversible, avoiding\nthe requirement for complex analyses of turnover and equilibrium\nkinetics. Even so, the senescence timeline can be readily run\nbackwards with the appropriate treatments, and may in\nprinciple be shunted back and forth at will (Zavaleta-Mancera\net al., 1999a,b). The biochemistry of chlorophyll metabolism\nin senescing cells has become well understood in recent years\n(Kr\u00e4utler & H\u00f6rtensteiner, 2006), most of the key genes have\nbeen isolated and there is a growing catalogue of mutants\nand knockouts in critical steps (Ougham et al., in press). The\npresent study describes observations of a mutant blocked at\nthe macrocycle-opening step as a consequence of impairment in\nunpacking pigment-protein complexes (Armstead et al., 2006).\nOther mutants \u2013 for example, acd1, acd2 and nyc1\u2013 target\nother reactions in the catabolic sequence (Ougham et al., in\npress). Precise chemical or pharmacological perturbation (in\nthe present study we used a stereospecific protein synthesis\ninhibitor) can give direct information on biochemistry and\ngene expression in this system and suggests strongly that current\ninterest in application of omics and systems biology techniques\n(Andersson et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2004; Buchanan-Wollaston\net al., 2005) is likely to pay off. Finally, mesophyll senescence\nsurvives scaling from the molecular through the physiological\n\u00a9 The Authors (2008).

For\nthese practical reasons, as well as experimental tractability, there\nis a strong argument for including senescence amongst the\npriorities for the application of plant systems biology approaches.\nAcknowledgements\nResearch at IGER and Aberystwyth University on spectral\nimaging and multivariate analysis has been partially funded by\nthe UK National Endowment for Science, Technology and\nthe Arts, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural\nAffairs and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences\nResearch Council (BBSRC) Bioinformatics and E-science\nProgram initiative.
