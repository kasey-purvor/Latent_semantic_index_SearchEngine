INTRODUCTION \nThe question of debt forgiveness for indebted developing countries has generated an \nenormous amount of political as well as academic interest. The political campaign by the \nJubilee 2000 network has been dubbed by a World Bank spokesman \u2018one of the most \neffective global lobbying campaigns I have ever seen\u2019 (cited in Hanlon, 2000, p. 878). An all-\nencompassing coalition from popstars, non-governmental organizations and churches to the \nWorld Bank and even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) seemingly united behind a call \nfor major debt forgiveness. Of course, hidden behind this apparent convergence of views lies \na great dispute about the exact details and the amount of debt to be forgiven. This is not the \nplace to discuss either the economic, political and ethical aspects of a call for debt forgiveness \nor the total amount of debt that should be forgiven (see, for example, Adams, 1991; \nMikkelsen, 1991; Hanlon, 2000; Roodman, 2001). Nor is this the place to tell the history of \n3 \ndebt forgiveness (for a brief exposition see, for example, Daseking and Powell, 1999). \nInstead, this article provides a quantitative analysis of the determinants of the allocation of \ndebt forgiveness among recipient countries in the past. \nNot many studies exist that have analyzed the allocation of debt forgiveness. That there is \na dearth of empirical studies is somewhat surprising on at least two accounts. First, in some \nsense debt forgiveness can be interpreted as foreign aid or official development assistance \n(ODA). As Bauer (1991, p. 57) points out: \u2018When the Third World\u2019s creditors relieve the \nsovereign debtors of meeting their obligations wholly or in part, they in effect provide a form \nof foreign aid. Foreign aid involves a positive flow of funds to recipient Third World \ngovernments. Debt relief involves the avoidance of a negative flow.\u20191 The vast majority of \ncountries receiving debt forgiveness also receive foreign aid. Debt forgiveness can therefore \neven be accompanied by a reduction in foreign aid if donor countries are not willing to \nincrease the net flow of resources to recipient countries. The point is that many authors \n(including the present one) have examined the determinants of the allocation of aid flows, but \n\u2013 despite their close links \u2013 not the determinants of the allocation of debt forgiveness (see, for \nexample, Boone, 1996; Svensson, 1999; Alesina and Dollar, 2000; Neumayer, 2001a, 2001b, \n2001c, 2002). Second, there is a mounting literature suggesting that the effects of aid flows \n(and consequently debt forgiveness as well) heavily depend on the quality of governance, \nbroadly understood, in the recipient country (see, for example, Burnside and Dollar, 1997; \nWorld Bank, 1998; Svensson, 1999; Br\u00e4utigam, 2000; Knack, 2000). This is not an \nuncontested proposition (see, for example, Hermes and Lensink, 2001). However, if this \nproposition is correct, then the question whether more debt forgiveness has been allocated to \ncountries with good governance assumes great importance. If the quality of governance was \nfound to play no role in the allocation of debt forgiveness then the beneficial effects of debt \nforgiveness would be put into great doubt. \n4 \nSection 2 reviews the literature and section 3 shows why rewarding governance \nperformance might be the only way to ensure that debt forgiveness becomes more effective. \nSection 4 presents the research design and section 5 discusses some pertinent statistical issues. \nResults are reported and discussed in section 6 with some sensitivity analyses undertaken in \nsection 7. Section 8 concludes. \n \n \n2. LITERATURE REVIEW \nAs mentioned, not many empirical studies have addressed the question what variables, if any, \ncan explain the allocation of debt forgiveness. Bauer (1991, p. 63) suggests that the allocation \nof debt forgiveness \u2018does not reflect the usual criteria on which official aid purports to be \nallocated among recipient governments, namely the level of incomes per head and the \ndevelopment prospects of the recipient countries. The beneficiaries of debt relief are simply \nthose governments that have decided not to honor their obligations and have been allowed to \ndo so very largely unscathed.\u2019 However, he does not provide a systematic quantitative \nanalysis to back up this claim. \nHern\u00e1ndez and Katada (1996) undertake very simple descriptive analysis of the criteria of \ndebt forgiveness on ODA (not including official non-concessional loans) for African \ncountries only. Dividing these countries into three groups according to the level of ODA debt \nforgiveness they find that neither absolute poverty as measured by gross national product \n(GNP) per capita nor lack of access to foreign exchange seem to have been determinants of \nthe allocation of ODA debt forgiveness. Such debt forgiveness is correlated with relative \nindebtedness as measured by debt per gross domestic product (GDP), but the middle group of \ncountries received much less debt forgiveness than the high group in spite of being severely \nmore indebted. \n5 \nAlesina and Weder (2000) provide a multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate on \nthe sum of debt relief between 1989 and 1997 for 68 countries, controlling for a range of \nvariables, all measured as 1990 to 1995 averages.2 Alesina and Weder (2000) find that initial \ndebt per GDP, the natural log of population size as well as the extent of a country\u2019s voting in \nconcurrence with Japan in the United Nations (UN) general assembly are statistically \nsignificant explanatory variables. A country\u2019s openness towards trade (interpreted by Alesina \nand Weder as a proxy for a good policy track record), the natural log of its initial income per \ncapita, its extent of respect for political rights, the number of years it has been a colony of one \nof the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and the \nextent of its voting in concurrence with the United States in the UN general assembly are all \ninsignificant. The coefficient of an added control variable for the extent of a country\u2019s \ncorruption is positive, but highly insignificant. \nThis paper analyses more comprehensively the role governance plays in the allocation of \ndebt forgiveness. The quality of governance has assumed great importance in recent studies \nlooking at the effectiveness of both aid and debt forgiveness. Knack (2000), for example, \nargues that aid flows to countries with a bad policy record might further weaken the quality of \ngovernance. Foreign aid can drag the more talented and skilled workers away to the donor \norganizations, which usually pay a higher salary. More importantly, foreign aid can \nexacerbate existing corruption: \u2018Aid is commonly used for patronage purposes, by subsidizing \nemployment in the public sector, or in state-operated enterprises, as foreign aid can provide \nfunds for government to undertake investment that would otherwise be made by private \ninvestors\u2019 (Knack, 2000, p. 5). In OLS estimation he finds evidence that those countries that \nreceived a greater share of aid tend to experience a decline in the quality of governance over \ntime. He suggests as a possible policy approach that \u2018a larger fraction of aid could be tied or \ndedicated to improvements in the quality of governance, for example, in the form of programs \n6 \nto establish meritocratic bureaucracies and strong, independent court systems\u2019 (Knack, 2000, \np. 22). \nIn panel growth regressions, Burnside and Dollar (1997) find that aid has a positive effect \non economic growth in recipient countries only if these are characterized by good governance \nin terms of good fiscal, monetary and trade policies. They estimate that the mean growth rate \nin their sample of poor developing countries would rise from 1.10% to 1.44% if the same \namount of aid had been allocated in greater accordance with the policy record of recipient \ncountries. Addressing more political aspects of governance, Svensson (1999, p. 293) finds \nthat foreign aid has a long-term positive growth impact on recipient countries only if these \nrespect political and civil liberties: \u2018Aid has a positive impact on growth in countries with an \ninstitutionalized check on governmental power; that is, in more democratic countries\u2019. \nEasterly (2000) examines why successive rounds of past debt forgiveness might not have \nhad a substantial positive effect on the recipient countries. In short, he argues that the \nrecipient countries might reveal behavior that is consistent with a high discount rate and a \npreference for high debt, thus substituting new borrowing for forgiven debt. He suggests that \n\u2018the granting of progressively more favorable terms for debt forgiveness may also have \nperverse incentive effects, as countries borrow in anticipation of debt forgiveness and delay \npolicy reforms waiting for the best deal\u2019 (Easterly, 2000, p. 6). For a simple cross-sectional \nOLS analysis of a sample of 41 HIPC countries which have benefited from several past \nrounds of debt forgiveness he finds some evidence that might suggest that these HIPCs dis-\ninvested in their productive potential at the same time as they accumulated high debts. He \nfurther concludes that those countries became highly indebted because of bad policies, not \nbecause of external shocks to their economies. He also finds that those countries that received \nmost debt forgiveness among the HIPCs also borrowed most anew. Easterly (2000, p. 30) \ndemands that \u2018some track record of low discount rate behavior should be required prior to \n7 \ngranting debt forgiveness\u2019. Otherwise the whole idea of debt forgiveness would become \nproblematic since more resources were to go to \u2018countries with bad policies\u2019 rather than to \n\u2018poor countries with good policies\u2019 (ibid., p. 31). \nAllen and Weinhold (2000), using a panel data fixed effects approach instead to test \nEasterly\u2019s hypothesis, fail to find evidence that countries who benefited most from debt \ncancellation, rescheduling or refinancing had higher inflation rates and a lower share of \ngovernment spending on capital. Thus they fail to confirm that these countries can be \nregarded as exhibiting high discount behavior. However, they as well recognize the need to \nallocate debt forgiveness according to some criteria related to the quality of governance. As \nAllen and Weinhold (2000, p. 870) point out, if all impoverished countries received debt \nforgiveness independent of their policy record, then this would in many cases provide finance \nfor \u2018manifestly corrupt, unaccountable, inefficient and oppressive governments, with little \ninterest in promoting social welfare\u2019. \n \n \n3. MAKING DEBT FORGIVENESS MORE EFFECTIVE \nTo ensure that debt forgiveness is more effective creditor countries have basically two options \navailable: First, they can impose conditions on the countries receiving debt forgiveness to the \neffect that they reform their policies, use the freed resources for particular purposes and \nsuccumb to specified criteria of transparency and accountability. A strong proponent of this \noption is, for example, the London-based Centre for Accountability and Debt Forgiveness \n(CADRE) (see Theobald, 1997). One minimum condition usually imposed on countries \nreceiving debt forgiveness is that they follow a program imposed by the IMF. Second, \ncreditor countries can try to allocate non-conditional debt forgiveness mainly to countries that \nhave revealed good governance in the past. \n8 \nThe first option is problematic for a range of reasons: First, it interferes with the \nsovereignty of the recipient country and is therefore bound to be met with the same kind of \nhostility as IMF conditionality for structural adjustment programs. Second, recipient countries \nwill do their best to merely create the image of compliance with the conditions imposed and \nrevert to their old policies as soon as the creditors turn away their attention. In principle, \npromised funds could be revoked once the cheating becomes detected, but, as Allen and \nWeinhold (2000, p. 861) observe, it is very difficult for the IMF and the World Bank to \nwithhold funds ex post if recipient countries do not comply (fully) with the ex ante agreed \nupon conditionality. Third, it is doubtful at least whether good governance can be externally \nimposed via conditions. Bad governance is usually deeply entrenched in a country\u2019s political \nsystem. It can only be overcome slowly and with the full support of the governing elite. \nFourth, for the reasons just mentioned conditionality often does not and cannot tackle the root \ncauses of bad governance, but merely requires the recipient country to change its spending \npattern.3 For example, in the so-called enhanced initiative by the IMF and the World Bank for \nhighly indebted poor countries (HIPCs) freed resources were supposed to be spent on poverty \nreduction. If countries did obey this kind of conditionality, however, the economic effect of \ndebt forgiveness might be zero or even negative. Burnside and Fanizza (2001, p. 1) argue that \nthe conditionality of the enhanced HIPC initiative \u2018implies that it provides no net relaxation of \nthe government\u2019s lifetime budget constraint\u2019 and that, worse still, \u2018an increase in aid resources \nspent domestically may produce short-run inflationary consequences that could hurt growth \nand destabilize output\u2019. Perversely, given the conditionality on government spending, the \nrecipient country can only keep inflation under control if it negates the debt forgiveness effect \nin issuing new debt substituting for the old forgiven debt. \nThe first option is therefore problematic on various accounts. Remains the second option: \ngive more debt forgiveness to countries that have shown good governance in the past with the \n9 \nhope that in rewarding past good governance these countries will strive to maintain good \ngovernance in the future. This is where the analysis of this article comes in. It aspires to \nprovide an answer to the question which variables have determined the allocation of debt \nforgiveness in the past and, in particular, whether countries with good governance have been \nrewarded with higher debt forgiveness. \n \n \n4. RESEARCH DESIGN \n(a) The dependent variable \nData on debt forgiveness, the dependent variable, were derived from the Global Development \nFinance database of the World Bank (World Bank, 2000a). It is defined as the change in debt \nstock due to debt forgiveness. It does not include debt conversion schemes such as debt \nbuybacks or debt for equity swaps. Note that the World Bank data recognize debt forgiveness \nonly as a change in stock and no flow transactions are recorded (World Bank, 2000b, p. 79). \nIf debt forgiveness is measured as cash-flow relief instead, often debt-service payments that \nare rescheduled or deferred are counted as debt forgiveness as well, which is somewhat \nmisleading since the net present value of the outstanding debt stock is not reduced. The \navailable data comprise the period 1989 to 1998. Ideally, one would like to make use of both \nthe cross-section and the time-series dimension of these data. However, debt forgiveness, \nunlike ODA, occurs in a rather discontinuous fashion. For this reason it was necessary to \ndiscard the time-series information and to take the sum of debt forgiveness between 1989 and \n1998 as the basis for the dependent variable. For the countries in our sample the total sum of \ndebt forgiven amounts to about US$50 billion. \nIn the next step the debt forgiveness data have to be made comparable across countries. \nTwo possible ways of doing this are to transform total debt forgiveness into a per capita \n10 \nvariable or to look at debt forgiveness per unit of GDP. In the main regressions reported \nbelow we will use GDP as the denominator. Population as the denominator is used in \nsensitivity analysis. Both population and GDP data in purchasing power parity came from \nWorld Bank (2001). \n \n(b) The independent variables \nAs concerns the explanatory variables, let us start with governance, our major variable of \ninterest. Governance is of course a very broad term. I define it here as the way in which policy \nmakers are empowered to make decisions, the way in which policy decisions are formulated \nand implemented and the extent of which governmental discretion is allowed to encroach into \nthe rights of citizens. To operationalize this definition of governance I use two different \ngroups of variables. The first group comprises a set of six aggregate indicators that capture \ndifferent aspects of governance. These indicators, developed by World Bank staff, are based \non several different sources, partly polls of experts, partly surveys of residents and \nentrepreneurs within a country (Kaufmann, Kraay and Zoido-Lobat\u00f3n, 1999a, 1999b). A \nlinear unobserved components model is used to aggregate these various sources into one \naggregate indicator. The advantage of such aggregation is that the underlying concept is \nmeasured with higher reliability and data become available for many more countries than \nwould be possible if using one source only. \nEach indicator provides a subjective assessment of some aspect of a country\u2019s quality of \ngovernance. The indicators are normalized such that they range from around -2.5 to 2.5 and \nhave a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Higher values signal better governance. \nThe six aggregate indicators address the following aspects (headings followed by a short \ndescription of the major components): \n \n11 \n\u2022 Voice and accountability: respect for political rights and civil liberties, public \nparticipation in the process of electing policy makers, independence of media, \naccountability and transparency of government decisions. \n\u2022 Political instability and violence: political and social tension and unrest, instability of \ngovernment. \n\u2022 Government effectiveness: stability, predictability and efficiency of governmental \ndecisions. \n\u2022 Regulatory burden: burden on business via quantitative regulations, price controls and \nother interventions into the economy. \n\u2022 Rule of law: respect for law and order, predictability and effectiveness of judiciary \nsystem, enforceability of contracts. \n\u2022 Graft: corruption, that is, the acceptance of money for providing extra-legal favours. \n \nNote that of these five dimensions of governance, \u201cregulatory burden\u201d is probably the \nmost contested and problematic one. It is strongly related to a particular neo-liberal view on \neconomic policy, whereas the other aspects of governance are more consensually accepted \nacross the political spectrum. Indeed, as we will see later, one of the components of this \nvariable derives from assessments of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative U.S.-based \nthink tank. \nI will use each indicator in isolation since they all measure different aspects of governance \nand it is interesting to see what aspect of governance, if any, has an impact upon the \nallocation of debt forgiveness. In addition, I use a measure of general governance that is the \naverage of the individual indicators \u2013 six in number for most countries, fewer for countries for \nwhich not all indicators were available.4 The idea is to see whether governance more \ngenerally is a determinant of debt forgiveness allocation. \n12 \nAs mentioned, two of the major advantages of the World Bank indicator set are that it is \navailable for many countries due to the aggregation of information from different sources \nwith differing coverage of countries and that it is perhaps more representative since it derives \nfrom a broad set of sources. At the same time, it suffers from a number of disadvantages as \nwell. For example, while the quality of governance is of course not a constant but evolves \nover time, all data entering the governance indicators stem from a single, but varying time \nperiod around the mid-1990s. One could argue that the bias introduced is likely to be small. \nFirst, the source data refer to subjective assessments for which respondents will have taken \ninto account the quality of governance over a range of past years rather than just for the year \nthey were surveyed. Second, the quality of certain aspects of governance in most countries is \nnot likely to change much from year to year. This is probably true for such aspects as \ngovernment effectiveness, rule of law and graft. However, other aspects of governance might \nchange quite rapidly. \nThe second group of proxy variables for governance has the advantage of varying over \ntime. It consists of three variables from the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) as well \nas one variable each from Freedom House and the Heritage Foundation. Whilst data from the \nprivate company, which provides the ICRG to international business, are normally \nprohibitively expensive to get for researchers, data covering the period 1989 to 1995 were \nmade freely available by King and Zeng (2001). The ICRG (2002) website describes the \nvariables used as follows: \n \n\u2022 Bureaucratic quality: institutional strength and quality of the bureaucracy; its capacity to \ngovern without drastic changes in policy or interruptions in government services; its \nautonomy from political pressure. \n13 \n\u2022 Law and order: strength and impartiality of the legal system together with the extent of \npopular observance of the law. \n\u2022 Corruption: excessive patronage, nepotism, job reservations, \u2018favor-for-favors\u2019, secret \nparty funding, and suspiciously close ties between politics and business. \n \nNote that \u201cBureaucratic quality\u201d is conceptually roughly comparable to \u201cGovernment \neffectiveness\u201d from the World Bank indicator set and indeed forms one of its components. \nThe same is true of \u201cLaw and order\u201d and \u201cRule of law\u201d and \u201cCorruption\u201d and \u201cGraft\u201d, \nrespectively. In addition, I use the \u201cCivil Liberties\u201d and \u201cPolitical Rights\u201d data from Freedom \nHouse (2000) over the period 1989 to 1998, which is conceptually roughly comparable to and \nforms one component of the \u201cVoice and accountability\u201d indicator from the World Bank. \nFinally, I use the simple average of the \u201ctrade policy\u201d, \u201cgovernment intervention\u201d, \u201ccapital \nflows and foreign investment\u201d, \u201cwage and price controls\u201d and \u201cregulation\u201d components of the \nHeritage Foundation\u2019s (2002) Index of Economic Freedom as a further variable, also called \n\u201cregulatory burden\u201d. This variable is conceptually roughly comparable and forms one \ncomponent of the \u201cregulatory burden\u201d variable of the World Bank indicator set. \nUnfortunately, the Heritage Foundation did not publish its index before 1995 so that the data \ncover the period 1995 to 1998 only. No time varying data were available that are conceptually \ncomparable to the \u201cPolitical instability and violence\u201d indicator of the World Bank indicator \nset. \n\u201cCorruption\u201d and \u201cLaw and order\u201d are measured by the ICRG on a zero to six points and \n\u201cBureaucratic Quality\u201d on a zero to four points scale. The higher the points the better a \ncountry fares with respect to the variable. The assessment is based on expert analysis from a \nworldwide network and is subjected to a peer review. The Freedom House data are based on \nexpert assessments of the extent to which a country effectively provides for political rights \n14 \nand civil liberties (Karatnycky 1999, pp. 546-553). \u201cPolitical rights\u201d refer to, for example, the \nexistence and fairness of elections, existence of opposition and the possibility to take over \npower via elections. \u201cCivil liberties\u201d refer to, for example, the freedom of assembly, the right \nto open and free discussion, the independence of media, protection from political terror and \nthe prevalence of the rule of law. Both are measured on a one to seven points scale and I \nadded the two variables for the purpose of analysis. The higher the score the better rights and \nliberties are protected. The Heritage Foundation (2002) data derive from partly objective, \npartly subjective assessments of pre-specified criteria. Their indices are measured on a one to \nfive point scale. For the purpose of this article, the data were reversed such that a higher score \nindicates less \u201cregulatory burden\u201d. Since the time-varying proxy variables for governance \nstem from different sources no attempt was made to provide an aggregate or average time-\nvarying governance indicator. \nBesides governance, which other variables are likely to have explanatory power? In \naccordance with the ODA allocation literature, I will look at two groups of variables. One \ngroup is supposed to measure the recipient country\u2019s need for debt forgiveness. The other \ngroup proxies the political interest of the creditors. The first group comprises three variables: \nFor rather obvious reasons the first two \u2013 total debt per GNP and debt service divided by the \nvalue of exports of goods and services \u2013 are often regarded as a good proxy for a country\u2019s \nneed for debt forgiveness (data from World Bank, 2000a).5 Note that this does not mean that \ncreditors themselves might not have an economic interest in forgiving debt for countries in \ndire need for debt forgiveness. While not uncontested, a huge amount of theoretical and \nempirical literature, as summarized comprehensively by Cline (1995, chapter 4), suggests that \nsevere so-called debt overhang might cripple a country\u2019s economy to an extent that debt \nforgiveness can be in the economic interest of creditors as well if it leads to a stimulation of \nthe economy and therefore to a higher prospect of servicing and paying back of the \n15 \noutstanding debt. As a third variable for a recipient country\u2019s need for debt forgiveness we \nwill consider the natural log of GDP per capita in purchasing power parity (data from World \nBank, 2001) since, all other things equal, a poorer country is more in need of debt forgiveness \nthan a richer one. \nPolitical interest of the creditors is measured by five variables. The first is the number of \nyears the recipient country has been a former colony of an OECD country (data taken from \nDollar and Alesina, 2000).6 Creditors might favor their former colonies in part at least \nbecause of a political interest in maintaining their influence on those countries. The second \nvariable is the natural log of the minimum distance in kilometers between the capital city of \nan indebted developing country to either New York, Rotterdam or Tokyo (data taken from \nGallup and Sachs, 1999).7 The idea is that donor countries might give more aid to \ngeographically close countries for reasons of strategic-political interest. This variable is \nsupposed to proxy this interest for the major creditor countries: The US and Canada, the \nEuropean Union countries as well as Japan. The third variable is arms imports as a percentage \nof total imports (data taken from World Bank, 2001). Many creditor countries are major arms \nexporters and might have an interest in forgiving debt of major arms importers. \nPerhaps none of the variables listed so far truly captures the political interests of the \nUnited States, the major national creditor and arguably the most important power in such \nmultilateral institutions as the World Bank and the IMF.8 The United States has few ex-\ncolonies and its political interests are global in nature. To capture some of the political interest \nthe United States has in debtor countries I therefore include two further variables: First, the \namount of per capita military grants allocated between 1989 and 1998 with data taken from \nUSAID (1999), divided by population (taken from World Bank, 2001). The other variable \ntries to measure the similarity of policy positions. Signorino and Ritter (1999) have developed \na measure of policy similarity. This measure conceptualises two policy positions as falling \n16 \nwithin a policy space defined by all the possible policy positions. The measure falls in the \ninterval \u20131 to 1, where \u20131 means that two policy positions are as far apart in the policy space \nas possible (complete dissimilarity) and 1 means that the two policy positions are identical \n(complete similarity). Gartzke, Jo and Tucker (1999) use this measure to provide estimates of \nthe similarity of policy positions as revealed by the voting behaviour in the UN General \nAssembly. Data for the similarity of policy positions of debtor countries with the United \nStates were available from 1989 to 1996. \nNote that for all explanatory variables that are not constant the average value over the \nperiod 1989 to 1998 or the latest available year was taken. We have debt forgiveness data for \n136 developing countries and countries in transition (former East bloc countries). However, \nthe number of observations in the regressions reported below is somewhat lower, depending \non the availability of explanatory variables. The starting regressions in each table reported in \nsection 6, which only includes variables measuring the recipient countries\u2019 need for debt \nforgiveness, comprises 125 countries. The annex lists these countries. \n \n \n5. STATISTICAL ISSUES \nWe will test the following three hypotheses. First, more debt forgiveness goes to countries \nin need of debt forgiveness. Second, more debt forgiveness goes to countries for which \ncreditors have a political interest. Third, more debt forgiveness goes to countries with good \ngovernance.  \nSome countries do not receive any debt forgiveness at all. There are basically two options for \ndealing with the limitedness of the dependent variable. One is to follow the lead of the ODA \nallocation literature and to distinguish between two stages in the process of debt forgiveness \nallocation in employing the so-called two-stage or two-part model (see, for example, \n17 \nCingranelli and Pasquarello, 1985; Carleton and Stohl, 1987). The first stage is the so-called \ngate-keeping stage where it is determined which countries receive debt forgiveness. The \nappropriate estimation technique for this kind of analysis is probit.9 The second stage is the \nso-called level stage where it is determined how much of a country\u2019s debt is forgiven, which \nhas been selected as a recipient of debt forgiveness in the first stage. Usually, OLS is used at \nthis stage. That this two-stage process might represent a realistic characterization is \ntentatively supported by the fact that sometimes explicit prerequisites for the eligibility for \ndebt forgiveness are stated. For example, to qualify for debt forgiveness as part of the United \nStates Enterprise for the America Initiative, recipient countries \u2018must have democratically \nelected governments, must not have repeatedly provided support for international terrorism, \nmust not fail to cooperate on international drug control, and must not engage in consistent \npatterns of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights\u2019 (Sanford, 1995, p. \n370, fn. 160). To qualify for the HIPC initiative of the World Bank and IMF, countries have \nto fulfill certain criteria with respect to their debt-to-export or, in few cases, their debt-to-tax \nratios (Cohen, 2000). \nThe second method for dealing with the limitedness of the dependent variable uses an \nestimation technique called tobit. Use of this technique does not necessitate breaking down \nthe process of aid allocation into two stages since, contrary to OLS techniques, tobit explicitly \ntakes into account that the dependent variable can be zero for a substantial part of the \npopulation.  \nNone of the two methods can be said to be superior since they are based on different \nassumptions. The two-stage method implicitly assumes that creditors actually do make two-\nstage decisions, i.e. that they first decide on whether or not a country is eligible for debt \nforgiveness and then on how much debt should be forgiven. Furthermore, it is assumed that \nthe error terms from both stages are uncorrelated. The tobit method avoids the potentially \n18 \nartificial construct of a two-stage allocation process, but it suffers from restrictive underlying \nassumptions as well. The two main ones are that, first, the same set of variables is assumed to \ndetermine both whether the dependent variable is zero and, if positive, what size it has. \nSecond, the sign of those variables is constrained to be the same (Verbeek, 2000, p. 207). The \nfirst assumption is not so problematic in the context of this article since I use the same \nvariables for both the gate-keeping stage and the level stage as well in the alternative method. \nThe second assumption is somewhat more restrictive. However, it does not seem \nunreasonable to assume that if a variable has a positive influence on the probability of \nreceiving any debt forgiveness at all, then it will also have a positive influence on the amount \nof debt forgiven. \nHeckman\u2019s (1979) two-step estimator can be interpreted as an extension of the tobit \nmethod (Amemiya 1985), relaxing both assumptions of the tobit method already mentioned as \nwell as allowing the error terms from both steps to be correlated. However, the two-step \nestimator requires an exclusionary variable that has a significant impact upon the first step \n(selection step), but not upon the second step. Unfortunately, such an exclusionary variable is \ntypically very difficult to find and without it model identification rests on restrictive \ndistributional assumptions only. This dependence on distributional assumptions renders the \ntwo-step estimator inferior to either the two-part model or the tobit method in many \ncircumstances (Puhani 2000), but not always (Leung and Yu 1996). Since no exclusionary \nvariable could be found for this article, the two-step estimation technique is not applied. \n \n \n6. RESULTS \nWe start with the tobit estimation technique testing for the influence of recipient need on the \nallocation of debt forgiveness (see regression I of table 1). Both income and the debt to GNP \n19 \nratio are statistically significant and have the expected sign. Richer countries are forgiven less \ndebt and countries burdened by a higher debt to GNP ratio are forgiven more debt. \nSurprisingly, the debt service to exports ratio has an unexpected coefficient, but tests highly \ninsignificant. Next, regression II enters our creditor interest variables. With the exception of \nU.S. military grants, all of them are statistically insignificant.10 Entering each creditor interest \nvariable in isolation leads to the same result (not shown). Clearly, creditor interest seems to be \na determinant of the allocation of debt forgiveness only with respect to direct United States \nmilitary or security interests. Since governance is our major explanatory variable and the \nother creditor interest variables remain highly insignificant when entered in combination with \nthe various governance variables, all of the following regressions were run with U.S. military \ngrants as the only creditor interest variable included. \n \n< Insert Table 1 about here > \n \nRegressions III to VIII enter each of our six different indicators of governance from the \nWorld Bank indicator set in isolation. Of these, \u201cvoice and accountability\u201d and \u201cregulatory \nburden\u201d are statistically significant with the expected sign. The other four indicators test \nhighly statistically insignificant. Regression IX enters the average governance indicator. It has \nthe expected sign and tests statistically significant at the 90% level. In table 2 we undertake \ntobit estimations with the governance variables from the Freedom House, Heritage \nFoundation and the ICRG indicator set. It confirms the results from table 1 in that \u201cpolitical \nrights and civil liberties\u201d and \u201cregulatory burden\u201d test statistically significant, whereas \n\u201cbureaucratic quality\u201d, \u201claw and order\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d do not. \n \n< Insert Table 2 about here > \n20 \n \nNext, we apply the two-stage method. Table 3 reports results for the first stage using the \nprobit estimation technique for the World Bank indicators. Note that the reported coefficients \nare not probit coefficients. Instead, they are already transformed into changes in the \nprobability at the mean of a variable, with all other independent variables held at their mean \nvalues as well.11 Regression I starts again with the recipient need variables. Only the debt to \nGNP ratio is statistically significant. A one point increase in the debt to GNP ratio above its \nmean value increases the likelihood of becoming eligible for debt forgiveness by 0.3% if the \nother two independent variables are held at their mean value. Regression II enters the creditor \ninterest variables, which are all statistically insignificant. The same is true for all the \ngovernance indicators in isolation as well as the average governance indicator with results \nreported in regressions III to IX. Note that in one regression the income variable becomes \nmarginally significant as does the debt service to exports ratio in another regression, but with \nan unexpected sign. \n \n< Insert Table 3 about here > \n \nTable 4 reports first-stage estimation results for the Freedom House, Heritage Foundation \nand ICRG indicators. As before, the debt to GNP ratio is statistically significant throughout. \nIncome is significant in two regressions. Interestingly, contrary to the comparable World \nBank indicator, \u201cpolitical rights and civil liberties\u201d tests significant with the expected sign. \nNone of the other governance indicators tests significantly. If the allocation of debt \nforgiveness can be characterized by two-stage decision making then only the debt to GNP \nratio and perhaps a country\u2019s poverty as well as its protection of political rights and civil \n21 \nliberties seem to be statistically significant determinants of the decision on which countries \nare deemed eligible for debt forgiveness in stage one. \n \n< Insert Table 4 about here > \n \nTable 5 reports results for the second stage using OLS for the World Bank indicator set. \nAs before, regression I starts with the recipient need variables. Similar to the tobit estimation \nresults, both income and the debt to GNP ratio are statistically significant and have the \nexpected sign. Entering the creditor interest variables in regression II confirms their statistical \ninsignificance, with the exception of U.S. military grants, which tests significant throughout. \nLooking at the governance indicators in isolation in regressions III to VIII suggests again \n\u201cvoice and accountability\u201d as well as \u201cregulatory burden\u201d as statistically significant \nexplanatory variables with the expected sign. The other four are again insignificant. The \naverage governance indicator tests statistically insignificant in regression IX. The coefficient \nof the income variable is significant in six regressions. \n \n< Insert Table 5 about here > \n \nTable 6 reports second-stage OLS estimation results for the Freedom House, Heritage \nFoundation and ICRG indicators. The debt to GNP ratio is statistically significant throughout \nas before, but the income variable only in two regressions. Interestingly, while the \ninsignificance of \u201cbureaucratic quality\u201d, \u201claw and order\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d confirms the \nanalysis in table 5, both \u201cpolitical rights and civil liberties\u201d and \u201cregulatory burden\u201d test \ninsignificant as opposed to \u201cvoice and accountability\u201d and the \u201cregulatory burden\u201d variable \nfrom the World Bank indicator set. \n22 \n \n< Insert Table 6 about here > \n \nAll in all the results reported above provide a mixed picture of the role the quality of \ngovernance plays in the allocation of debt forgiveness. Apart from \u201cpolitical rights and civil \nliberties\u201d none of our six governance indicators is a statistically significant determinant of \nwhether or not a country is deemed eligible for receiving any debt forgiveness. As concerns \nthe amount of debt forgiven most of our governance indicators remain statistically \ninsignificant independent of the estimation technique used. \u201cVoice and accountability\u201d, \n\u201cpolitical rights and civil liberties\u201d as well as the \u201cregulatory burden\u201d variable from both \nindicator sets assume statistical significance in the tobit estimations. But only \u201cvoice and \naccountability\u201d as well as \u201cregulatory burden\u201d from the World Bank indicator set remain \nstatistically significant in the OLS estimations of the two-stage technique. Even then, the \neffect of good governance on the allocation of debt forgiveness is somewhat modest. To see \nthis, refer to table 7, which compares the second stage OLS regressions III and VI from table \n5 to the same model without the governance indicators, but provides standardized beta \ncoefficients instead and constrains the sample to be the same. The R2 rises from .4292 to \nmerely .4624 if \u201cvoice and accountability\u201d is added as an explanatory variable and to .4627 if \n\u201cregulatory burden\u201d is added instead. In other words, variations in our governance indicators \ndo not add much to an explanation of the variation in the dependent variable debt forgiveness. \nLooking at the beta coefficients we see that the effect of \u201cvoice and accountability\u201d is \nestimated as .22 and that of \u201cregulatory burden\u201d as .20. In other words, a one standard \ndeviation increase in these aspects of governance leads to a .19 and .22 standard deviation \nincrease in debt forgiveness. In comparison, the effect on the dependent variable of a one \n23 \nstandard deviation increase in the debt to GNP ratio, one of the variables measuring a \ncountry\u2019s need for debt forgiveness, is about three times higher.  \n \n< Insert Table 7 about here > \n \n \n7. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS12 \nWhat happens to the results for the governance indicators if we replace the dependent variable \ndebt forgiveness per GDP by debt forgiveness per capita? The answer is not much. The only \ndifference is that the average governance variable as well as the \u201cregulatory burden\u201d variable \nfrom the Heritage Foundation in tobit estimation become statistically insignificant, whereas \n\u201cgraft\u201d assumes statistical significance. \u201cLaw and order\u201d also assumes statistical significance, \nbut with an unexpected sign, both in the tobit as well as the second stage OLS estimations. \nThat is, countries with a lower \u201claw and order\u201d performance are estimated to receive higher \ndebt forgiveness per capita. \nAre the major results driven by the presence of outliers? The answer is no. Belsley, Kuh \nand Welsch (1980) suggest excluding observations as outliers that have both high residuals \nand a high leverage. I applied their criterion together with their suggested cut-off point to the \nmodel that includes all three debtor need variables plus the United States military grants \nvariable for the regressions for which debt forgiveness per GDP is the dependent variable.13 \nDoing so leads to the exclusion of Angola, Bolivia, Congo (Republic), Egypt, Guinea-Bissau, \nGuyana, Nicaragua, Yemen and Zambia from the sample. As concerns the governance \nvariables, the only thing that changes is that the average governance indicator as well as \n\u201cpolitical rights & civil liberties\u201d and the \u201cregulatory burden\u201d variable from the Heritage \nFoundation become statistically significant in the level stage estimations. Interestingly, the \n24 \nUnited States military grants variable loses significance in all tobit estimations, tests \nsignificant with a negative sign in most first-stage regressions and remains significant with a \npositive sign in most second-stage OLS regressions. In other words, once outliers are \nexcluded countries that receive more United States military grants per capita are less likely to \nreceive debt forgiveness, but once selected receive more debt forgiveness than others. \nAs concerns potential problems caused by simultaneity, these should only be marginally \nrelevant for our governance indicators. There is no reason to presume that the amount of debt \nforgiveness will have had a substantial impact upon the quality of governance. While there \nhave sometimes been conditions imposed on the beneficiary countries with regard to, for \nexample, government spending, no such conditions with regard to governance were set up to \nany great extent. As argued above, even if they were it would be doubtful whether recipient \ncountries would actually be willing to put the demands into reality. It seems equally doubtful \nthat they would change the quality of their governance on their own in response to debt \nforgiveness. \nSimultaneity is likely to be much more of a problem for the three indicators measuring \nrecipient country need. After all, it is the very aim of debt forgiveness to reduce the debt to \nGNP ratio as well as the debt service to exports ratio and to increase, if indirectly, income \nlevels within the recipient country. To check for simultaneity bias in the estimations, I have \ntherefore instrumented these three variables using their respective average values in the five \nyear period 1984 to 1988 as instruments. Since these instruments are determined prior to the \nperiod of debt forgiveness looked at here, simultaneity bias should no longer pose a problem. \nWith respect to United States military grants one might argue that they are not influenced \nby the amount of debt a country is forgiven, since the grants fulfil specific United States \nstrategic policy interests. On the other hand, since both military grants and debt forgiveness \nimprove the net financial position of the recipient country the two could be regarded as \n25 \nsubstitutes both from the perspective of the United States and the recipient country. However, \nthis assumes that the resources freed up by debt forgiveness would be spent on the same \npurposes that the military grants would have been spent on. \nOn the whole, there seemed to be strong arguments for instrumenting only with respect to \nthe debtor need variables.14 Of course, this comes at the price of a decrease in the precision of \nestimation as well as loss of observations since often the instruments are not available for all \ncountries. It is interesting to note that even then \u201cvoice and accountablity\u201d as well as \n\u201cregulatory burden\u201d from the World Bank indicator set remain statistically significant with \nthe expected sign in both tobit and second-stage OLS estimations, whilst \u201cpolitical rights and \ncivil liberties\u201d is significant in the first-stage probit estimations. In all other cases, none of the \ngovernance variables assumes significance, apart from \u201claw and order\u201d, which is significant \nwith an unexpected sign in both tobit and first-stage probit estimations. As concerns the \ndebtor need as well as the United States military grants variable, there is practically no change \ncompared to the regressions without instrumentation. \n \n \n8. CONCLUSION \nThe analysis in this paper has shown that the need for debt forgiveness is clearly a powerful \ndeterminant of the allocation of debt forgiveness, thus confirming the first hypothesis. As \nconcerns the second hypothesis, the evidence supports the statistical significance of creditors\u2019 \npolitical interest only for the United States military grants variable. As concerns the third \nhypothesis, there is no clear answer. There is evidence that some aspects of governance have \nan influence on the allocation of debt forgiveness, but other aspects and governance in general \nwere often found to be statistically insignificant. It is maybe not surprising that of all the \ndifferent governance aspects \u201cvoice and accountability\u201d, \u201cpolitical rights and civil liberties\u201d \n26 \nand \u201cregulatory burden\u201d should stand out as having some, if modest, influence on the \nallocation of debt forgiveness. After all, the respect for the political and participatory rights of \ncitizens and the abstention from highly distortionary and burdensome economic policies have \nlong been a top priority on the demand list of aid donors and debt creditors. As mentioned \nabove, whilst respect for political and participatory rights of citizens is more consensually \naccepted as one aspect of good governance, \u201cregulatory burden\u201d is more contestable as it \nrelates to a particular view on economic policy making. \nOverall, it seems therefore fair to say that in the past debt forgiveness has not been used \nmuch to reward countries with good governance. From a normative point of view, future debt \nforgiveness should revert this. Allocating a greater share of debt forgiveness to countries with \ngood governance would set the right incentives for highly indebted countries and would most \nlikely lead to a more effective and productive use of the resources employed. This will be true \nno matter what the total amount of debt forgiven for all countries, an issue, which this article \nhas not discussed. \nBy implication, a similar argument can be made for the allocation of new lending and, \nindeed, for aid disbursement. Critics argue that the debt crisis is partly to blame on loose \nlending to corrupt and unaccountable governments with poor and highly distortive economic \npolicies, that is, countries with bad governance (Hanlon, 2000; Roodman, 2001). To prevent \nthis from re-occurring lenders need to take better into account the quality of governance of \npotential borrowers whilst at the same time trying to help those countries improving their \ngovernance that are committed to reform. \nIn order to do so, creditors and lenders need to invest more into developing high-quality \nindicators of governance and collecting the necessary data. At the moment, besides major \nefforts at the World Bank, the construction of governance indicators is mainly left to private \ncompanies that sell their information to international business. Their view on what constitutes \n27 \ngood governance need not coincide with how creditors and lenders perceive good governance, \nhowever. There is therefore still a long way to go to strengthen the importance of good \ngovernance in international financial lending and aid allocation decisions. \n28 \nNOTES \n                                                 \n1\n Note that debt relief and debt forgiveness are often used interchangeably, while sometimes debt relief is also \nused as a more general term encompassing forgiveness, rescheduling, buyback schemes etc. In section 4, we will \ndefine the meaning of debt forgiveness used in this article. \n2\n Note that Alesina and Weder (2000) use the term \u2018debt relief\u2019 in a broader sense encompassing both debt \nforgiveness and debt rescheduling. \n3\n Indeed, as Theobald (1997, p. 301) points out, at least for Africa and despite the rhetoric to the contrary, \nconditionality has always focused on purely economic rather than political aspects. Bad governance is as much a \npolitical as an economic problem, however. \n4\n Note that due to strong collinearity the six indicators of governance were not entered simultaneously. \n5\n From a theoretical perspective the debt to exports ratio could have been used in lieu of the debt to GNP ratio \n(the two variables are highly correlated \u2013 correlation coefficient of .67 in our sample). However, the debt to GNP \nratio proved to be a much more potent explanatory variable and was therefore preferred here. \n6\n Alternatively, a dummy variable for colonial status could have been created. The results on the colony variable \nreported below remain basically the same if the dummy variable is used instead. \n7\n If this data was not available for a particular country, the existing data from a geographically close country was \ntaken instead. \n8\n On United States influence in the World Bank, see, for example, Wade (2002). \n9\n Alternatively, logit estimation could have been undertaken. The two techniques provide very similar results in \nstandard situations (Verbeek, 2000). \n10\n Note that contrary to Alesina and Weder (2000) we find that creditors do not forgive more debt for their \nformer colonies. The results are not directly comparable, however, since Alesina and Weder (2000) look at debt \nrelief rather than debt forgiveness and employ a much smaller sample. \n11\n Note that the probabilities are contingent on specific values of the independent variables because the probit \nmodel is nonlinear, and therefore nonadditive, in the probabilities. \n12\n In order to save space results of the sensitivity analysis are merely described, but not reported. All results can \nbe received from the author upon request. \n13\n The criterion is to exclude an observation if its so-called DFITS is greater than twice the square root of (k\/n), \nwhere k is the number of independent variables and n the number of observations. DFITS is defined as the \nsquare root of (hi\/(1-hi)), where hi is an observation\u2019s leverage, multiplied by its studentized residual. \n29 \n                                                                                                                                                        \n14\n There is practically no change if United States military grants are instrumented for as well in the same way as \nthe debtor need variables are. \n30 \nREFERENCES \nAdams, P.
