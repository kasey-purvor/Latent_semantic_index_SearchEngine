All rights reserved. 0002-9297\/2006\/7902-0004$15.00\nAlexander disease (MIM 203450) is a rare and often fatal\nneurological disorder, first described by W. S. Alexander.1\nOn the basis of age at onset, the disorder has been divided\ninto three subtypes: infantile, juvenile, and adult.2 The in-\nfantile form, with onset between birth and age \u223c2 years,\nis the most common type and is characterized by extensive\nloss of white matter.3\u20135 A striking neuropathological fea-\nture of all forms of Alexander disease is the presence of\nRosenthal fibers, unique cytoplasmic inclusions within as-\ntrocytes that contain the major astrocytic intermediate\nfilament (IF) protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)\nand the chaperones aB-crystallin and HSP27.6\u20138 Although\nthe GFAP within Rosenthal fibers appears disorganized, as-\ntrocytes in Alexander disease also possess GFAP filaments\nwith conventional 10-nm morphology.\nRecently, missense point mutations in GFAP have been\nidentified as a genetic basis for Alexander disease.9 To date,\nall known mutations have been heterozygous, indicating\nthat the mutant form of the protein is dominant over the\nwild type. This is consistent with the finding of autosomal\ndominant mutations in 26 other IF genes that are linked\nto human disease,10,11 summarized in the online Inter-\nmediate Filament Disease Mutation Database. The list of\nknown mutations in GFAP now includes 32 nucleotide\nchanges that affect 24 aa spread throughout the entire\nsequence12 (see also the Alexander Disease Web site). The\nmutations usually arise spontaneously during spermato-\ngenesis,13 with familial cases being quite rare because of\nthe high morbidity associated with the disease. The mu-\ntation studied in this report, R416W, is one of the four\nmutations reported in familial cases and is also found in\nsporadic cases.12\nLike other IF family members, GFAP has a characteristic\ndomain structure comprising a central a-helical rod do-\nmain flanked by non\u2013a-helical N-terminal \u201chead\u201d and C-\nterminal \u201ctail\u201d domains.14 The rod domain contains char-\nacteristic heptad repeats of hydrophobic residues, which\nare the underlying basis for the coiled-coil dimer in the\nfilament, and the highly conserved LNDR and TYRK-\nLEGGE motifs that are present at the start and the end of\n198 The American Journal of Human Genetics Volume 79 August 2006 www.ajhg.org\nthis central rod domain.10 Both of these motifs are highly\nconserved throughout the whole IF family,15 and those\nmutations in Alexander disease and other genetic IF pro-\ntein disorders found within them usually correlate with\nthe severest forms of the diseases.10,11 The crystallization\nof regions containing these two motifs from vimentin, a\nclosely related type III IF protein16,17 that coassembles with\nGFAP, has provided the atomic structure of these particular\nhighly conserved motifs. Our knowledge of the important\nhigher order interactions within the filament, however, is\nstill limited to low-resolution studies18\u201320; therefore, the\nfull structural impact of most of these rod mutations has\nnot yet been detailed.\nOne of the other common mutations outside the cen-\ntral rod domain of GFAP that causes Alexander disease is\nR416W. This mutation occurs in the tail domain within\nthe RDG motif, which is conserved among all GFAP pro-\nteins from multiple species, as well as the related type III\nIF proteins vimentin and desmin. Here, we describe the\neffects of this mutation on GFAP assembly and use this\nR416W GFAP mutant to identify the early events in the\ndevelopment of Alexander disease.\nMaterial and Methods\nPlasmid Construction and Site-Directed Mutagenesis\nTotal RNA was extracted from human astrocytoma U373MG cells\nwith the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The complete human GFAP cDNA\nwas amplified by RT-PCR, with the SuperScript RT-PCR system\n(Invitrogen), with use of oligonucleotides 5\u2032-CATATGGAGAGGA-\nGACGCAT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TCACATCACATCCTTGTGCT-3\u2032 as forward\nand reverse primers, respectively. The amplified PCR product\nwas cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), to generate\npGEM-T Easy-WTGFAP, and the entire sequence was confirmed\nagainst the GenBank database entry for GFAP (accession number\nJ04569). The R416W mutation was introduced by QuickChange\nsite-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) with use of the pGEM-T\nEasy-WTGFAP vector as a template. The following mutagenic ol-\nigonucleotides that contained the desired CrT mutation at np\n1246 were synthesized: 5\u2032-GAAGACCGTGGAGATGTGGGATGG-\nAGAGGTCAT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ATGACCTCTCCATCCCACATCTCCACG-\nGTCTTC-3\u2032. The amplified PCR product containing the R416W\nmutation was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector, and the mu-\ntation sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For expres-\nsion in cultured mammalian cells, both the wild-type and R416W\nGFAP cDNA in the pGEM-T Easy vector were subcloned into the\npcDNA3.1(\u0001) vector (Invitrogen) with use of the XbaI and EcoRI\nrestriction sites. The GFAP mutant R239C was also subcloned into\npCDNA3.1 from the pRSVi vector21 with use of the restriction\nenzyme HindIII. For expression in bacteria, wild-type and R416W\nGFAP cDNA samples were subcloned into the pET23b vector (No-\nvagen) with use of the NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites.\nExpression and Purification of Recombinant GFAPs\nFor bacterial expression of proteins, pET 23b vector containing\neither wild-type or mutant GFAP cDNA samples were transformed\ninto Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen). After trans-\nformation, cultures were grown in Luria Bertani medium supple-\nmented with appropriate antibiotics to OD600 of 0.5\u20130.6, and pro-\ntein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-\n1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Overexpressed GFAP formed\ninclusion bodies, which were prepared as described elsewhere.22\nThe final pellets, consisting predominantly of GFAP, were solu-\nbilized in extraction buffer (8 M urea, 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4],\n5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], and 1 mM\nphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF]) at room temperature for\n3 h, and any insoluble material was removed by centrifugation,\nat , in a benchtop Optima MAX Ultracentrifuge with100,000 g\nuse of an MLA-80 rotor (Beckman Coulter). GFAP was further\npurified by ion-exchange chromatography with use of a Merck-\nHitachi Biochromatography system equipped with a Fractogel-\nEMD TMAE 650S column (Merck) pre-equilibrated in the column\nbuffer (6 M urea, 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM\nEGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF). GFAP was eluted from the\ncolumn with a linear gradient of 0\u20130.5 M NaCl in the same buffer\nover 1 h at a flow rate of 1 ml\/min. The GFAP-enriched fractions\nwere pooled, concentrated, and applied to a Fractogel EMD COO-\n650S column (Merck) and were pre-equilibrated with column\nbuffer (6 M urea, 20 mM sodium formate [pH 4.0], 5 mM EDTA,\n1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF). After washing with\nbuffer B, GFAP was eluted with a linear gradient of 0\u20130.5 M NaCl\nin the same buffer. Column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE,\nand those containing purified GFAP were collected and stored at\n\u000180\u0002C. Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchonic\nacid assay (BCA reagent [Perbio Science]) with use of BSA as\nstandard.\nIn Vitro Assembly and Sedimentation Assay\nPurified GFAP was diluted to 0.3 mg\/ml in 6 M urea in a buffer\nof 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 1\nmM DTT and was dialyzed stepwise against 3 M urea in the same\nbuffer for 4\u20136 h at room temperature and then against the same\nbuffer without urea overnight at 4\u0002C. Filament assembly was com-\npleted by dialyzing against assembly buffer (20 mM imidazole-\nHCl [pH 6.8], 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT) for 12\u201316 h at room\ntemperature. The efficiency of in vitro assembly was assessed by\nsedimentation assay as described elsewhere.23 In brief, the assem-\nbly mixture was layered onto a 0.85-M sucrose cushion in assem-\nbly buffer and was centrifuged at for 30 min. To inves-80,000 g\ntigate the effect of mutations on filament-filament interactions,\nassembled filaments were subjected to low-speed centrifugation\nat for 10 min in a bench-top centrifuge (Eppendorf). The3,000 g\nsupernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE24 and\nwere visualized by Coomassie blue staining. In some instances,\nthe proportion of GFAP distributed between pellet and super-\nnatant fractions was measured using an image analyzer (LAS-\n1000plus [FujiFilm]). Coomassie blue signals for individual bands\nwere quantified using the Image Gauge software (v. 4.0) (FujiFilm).\nElectron Microscopy\nGFAP was diluted in assembly buffer to 100 mg\/ml and was neg-\natively stained with 1% (w\/v) uranyl acetate (Agar Scientific).\nSamples on carbon-coated copper grids were examined with a\nPhillips 400T transmission electron microscope, with use of an\naccelerating voltage of 80 kV. Images were acquired at a magni-\nfication of on Kodak 4489 film and then were digitized17,000#\nat \u2013pixel resolution before being processed further1,200# 1,200\nin Adobe Photoshop 7 (Adobe Systems).\nwww.ajhg.org The American Journal of Human Genetics Volume 79 August 2006 199\nCell Cultures and Transient Transfection\nHuman breast cancer epithelial MCF7 cells were obtained from\nthe European Collection of Cell Cultures (Sigma). Human adrenal\ncortex carcinoma SW\/cl.1 and SW13\/cl.2 cells were kindly pro-\nvided by Dr. Robert Evans (University of Colorado Health Sciences\nCenter, Denver). The human astrocytoma cell line U343MG was\na gift from Dr. Rutka (Toronto), and the cells were grown inaMEM\n(Invitrogen). These cells express vimentin and GFAP as well as\nHSP27 and aB-crystallin. Primary mouse astrocytes from wild-\ntype and vimentin\/GFAP double-knock littermates were a gen-\nerous gift of Dr. Milos Pekny (Go\u00a8teborg, Sweden). They were pre-\npared and grown as described elsewhere.25 Unless otherwise\nstated, cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium\nsupplemented with 10% (v\/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine,\n100 U\/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg\/ml streptomycin (Sigma) and\nwere maintained at 37\u0002C in a humidified incubator of 95% (v\/v)\nair and 5% (v\/v) CO2.\nFor transient transfection studies, cells grown on 13-mm cov-\nerslips at a density of 40%\u201350% confluency were transfected with\npcDNA3.1(\u0001) expressing either wild-type or R416W GFAP, with\nuse of GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s protocol. In some experiments, the R239C GFAP21\nand myc-tagged ubiquitin (His6-myc-Ubiquitin)\n26 were used. Cells\nwere analyzed by double-label immunofluorescence microscopy\n48 h after transfection.\nAntibody Production\nMouse monoclonal antibodies were made that specifically rec-\nognized human but not wild-type R416W GFAP. The immuno-\ngen was a peptide dodecamer centered on the mutation site,\nKTVEMWDGEVIK (Genemed Synthesis), which was linked to\nkeyhole limpet hemocyanin. Monoclonal antibodies were pro-\nduced by the UAB Epitope Recognition Core, which also per-\nformed an initial ELISA screen against purified recombinant wild-\ntype and R416W mutant GFAP. The corresponding wild-type\npeptide, KTVEMRDGEVIK, failed to produce monoclonal anti-\nbodies specific to the wild-type sequence.\nImmunostaining of Cells and Tissues\nand Immmunofluoresence Microscopy\nImmunocytochemistry of cultured cells was performed on cov-\nerslips washed twice with PBS, and the cells were fixed in either\nice-cold methanol\/acetone (1:1 [v\/v]) for 20 min or in 4% (w\/v)\nparaformaldehyde\/PBS for 10 min. In the case of paraformalde-\nhyde fixation, cells were subsequently permeabilized with 0.5%\nNP-40 in PBS for 10 min. After being washed twice with PBS\ncontaining 0.02% (w\/v) sodium azide and 0.02% (w\/v) BSA (PBS\/\nBSA\/azide), cells were blocked with 10% (v\/v) goat serum in PBS\/\nBSA\/azide for 20 min and then were incubated with primary an-\ntibodies at room temperature for 1 h. The primary antibodies used\nin this study were mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP (G-A-5, 1:500\n[Sigma]), rabbit polyclonal GFAP antibodies (Z0334, 1:500 [Da-\nko]), monoclonal anti-human GFAP (SMI-21, 1:500 [Sternberger\nMonoclonals]), monoclonal anti-keratin 18 (LE41 [kindly pro-\nvided by Prof. Birgit Lane, University of Dundee, Dundee, United\nKingdom), monoclonal anti-R416W GFAP (19.2 and 1A3, de-\nscribed below, 1:500), rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP (clone 3270,\n1:200),27 polyclonal anti-vimentin (clone 3052, 1:200),28 and the\nmyc-epitope monoclonal antibody (Clone 9E11, 1:10).29 After\ncells were washed with PBS\/BSA\/azide, the primary antibodies\nwere detected using Alexa 488 (1:400 [Molecular Probes]) or Alexa\n594 (1:600 [Molecular Probes]) conjugated secondary antibodies.\nAll antibodies were diluted in PBS\/BSA\/azide buffer. The glass\ncoverslips were mounted on slides with the fluorescent protecting\nagent Citifluor (Citifluor Labs) and were observed with a Zeiss\nLSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss). Optical\nsections were set to \u223c1.0 mm. Images were processed and prepared\nfor figures with Adobe Photoshop 7 (Adobe Systems). Quantita-\ntion of the GFAP filament phenotypes was by visual assessment\nof the cells and by scoring cells for the presence or absence of\nGFAP-containing aggregates. Approximately 100\u2013150 transfected\ncells were assessed, and each experiment was repeated at least\nthree times.\nImmunohistochemistry from normal human and Alexander\ndisease brain sections was performed on 6 mm\u2013thick paraffin sec-\ntions kindly provided by Drs. Jim Goldman and Goumei Tang\n(Columbia Medical School, New York). Internal review board ap-\nproval was obtained from Columbia Medical School for these\nstudies. Archival material for the infantile R416W Alexander dis-\nease case used in this study was described elsewhere.30 Primary\nantibodies were rabbit anti-cow GFAP (Z0334, 1:5,000 [Dako]),\nand mouse anti-R416W GFAP (19.2, described below, 1:2,000).\nSecondary antibody for the peroxidase method was peroxidase-\nconjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch)\n(1:2,000), with staining visualized using 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine\ntetrachloride (DAB, metal-enhanced Substrate Kit [Pierce]). Sec-\nondary fluorescent antibodies are described above. Some sections\nwere counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) to reveal nuclei.\nUltrastructural Analysis by Immunoelectron Microscopy\nMCF7 cells grown on 10-cm2 petri dishes (Greiner Bio-One) were\ntransfected with either wild-type or R416W GFAP for 48 h. Cells\nwere then fixed directly in 80 mM cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2)\ncontaining 1.25% (v\/v) glutaraldehyde and 1% (w\/v) paraformal-\ndehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were scraped off\nthe dish by a rubber policeman, were pelleted by low-speed cen-\ntrifugation, and were washed three times with cacodylate buffer.\nThe cells were then postfixed with 1% (w\/v) osmium tetroxide\nin cacodylate buffer. After several washes with distilled water, cells\nwere subjected to a series of graded ethanol dehydration, followed\nby overnight incubation in 1:1 propylene oxide:epoxy resin\n(Durcupan [Sigma]). After two changes of 100% fresh resin, cell\npellets were transferred to BEEM capsules (Agar Scientific) and\nwere polymerized in fresh resin overnight at 60\u0002C. Ultrathin sec-\ntions were generated using a Leica Ultracut ultramicrotome and\nwere collected on pioloform and carbon-coated nickel grids (Agar\nScientific). The grid specimens were then etched with 1% periodic\nacid, and osmium was removed by 2% (w\/v) sodium periodate\nbefore incubation with blocking solution consisting of 0.5% (w\/\nv) fish skin gelatin (Sigma) in PBS. Subsequently, sections were\nincubated with polyclonal anti-GFAP antibodies (clone 3270) di-\nluted 1:20 in blocking solution for 90 min, were washed three\ntimes in PBS, and then were incubated with protein A conjugated\nwith 5-nm gold particles (British BioCell International) for 2 h.\nAfter several washes in distilled water, specimens were stained\nwith saturated aqueous uranyl acetate (3% [w\/v]) for 30 min,\nfollowed by staining with lead citrate for 30 min.31 Stained sam-\nples were subsequently examined on an FEI Tecnai 12 transmis-\nsion electron microscope (FEI).\n200 The American Journal of Human Genetics Volume 79 August 2006 www.ajhg.org\nFigure 1. The dominant effect of R416W GFAP, revealed by in vitro assembly studies. Purified GFAP at a concentration of 0.3 mg\/ml\nwas assembled in vitro by stepwise dialysis into assembly buffer, as described in the \u201cMaterial and Methods\u201d section. Assembled filaments\nwere negatively stained and were visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Under these assembly conditions, wild-type GFAP\nassembled into typical 10-nm filaments with length of several microns (A), whereas R416W GFAP alone and in different proportions\nwith wild-type protein formed short filamentous intermediates that had a strong tendency to aggregate (B\u2013E). It is difficult to see the\nstructural detail of the aggregates formed by R416W GFAP (D) and mixtures thereof (B and C) when negatively stained with uranyl\nacetate. Sometimes, less aggregated material can be found, and then, at higher magnification (E), the filamentous structures that\ncomprise the aggregates are clearly seen. Mixing wild-type GFAP in either 75:25 (B) or 50:50 (C) proportions with R416W GFAP failed\nto rescue intermediate filament formation, and similar aggregates were formed (B and C). A low-speed sedimentation assay was used\nto assess the extent of this aggregation. F, Wild-type (WT) (lanes 1 and 2) and R416W GFAP (lanes 7 and 8) were assembled, either\nindividually or in mixtures of 75:25 (lanes 3 and 4) or 50:50 (lanes 5 and 6) WT:R416W GFAP. After assembly, the samples were subjected\nto low-speed centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and were visualized\nby Coomassie blue staining. Whereas only one-third of assembled wild-type GFAP was sedimented (lane 1), almost all the R416W mutant\nwas found in the pellet fraction (lane 8). Mixing wild-type GFAP with the R416W mutant in different proportions did not dramatically\nincrease the GFAP signal in either the supernatant fraction of the 50:50 mixture (lane 5) or the 75:25 mixture (lane 3). These data\nshow that the effects of R416W GFAP on in vitro filament assembly is dominant over the wild-type protein.

At 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed\nusing two different extraction buffers, designed to test the resis-\ntance of GFAP filaments and aggregates to extraction. In the mild\nextraction protocol, cells were lysed on ice for 15 min in 1 ml\nmild extraction buffer (MEB; 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 140 mM\nNaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5% [v\/v] NP-40 supplemented\nwith Complete protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche Diagnostics],\nand 1 mM PMSF). In the more severe extraction protocol, cells\nwere lysed in 1 ml of a harsher extraction buffer (HEB) containing\ndeoxycholate (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM\nEDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% [v\/v] NP-40, 0.5% [w\/v] sodium deoxy-\ncholate supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor cocktail\n[Roche Diagnostics], and 1 mM PMSF).

Effect of R416W and R239C mutations on the de novo GFAP IF network formation in IF-free cells. SW13\/cl.2 (A\u2013C) and\nprimary astrocytes derived from GFAP\/vimentin-null mice (D-F) were transiently transfected with either wild-type (A and D), R416W (B\nand E), or R239C (C and F) GFAP. At 48 h after transfection, the distribution of GFAP was assessed by confocal immunofluorescence\nmicroscopy with use of the rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP antibody. When expressed in SW13\/cl.2 cells, wild-type GFAP assembled into\nbundled filaments that extended throughout the cytoplasm (A). In contrast, cells transfected with either R416W (B) or R239C (C) GFAP-\nexpression plasmids exhibited only GFAP-positive aggregates. In the IF-free mouse astrocytes, wild-type GFAP assembled into extended\nfilaments at the cell periphery with some perinuclear accumulations (D), whereas R416W mutant GFAP formed punctuate aggregates\nscattered throughout the cytoplasm without any detectable filaments (E). Expression of R239C GFAP also induced numerous GFAP\naggregates in the cytoplasm (F). For both R416W and R239C GFAP, all the transfected cells had aggregates.

After the blotting, protein-transfer efficiency was\nassessed by Ponceau S (Sigma) staining of the nitrocellulose mem-\nbrane, followed by destaining in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mM\nTris-HCl [pH 7.4], and 150 mM NaCl). Membranes were blocked\nfor 2 h in blocking buffer containing 5% (w\/v) BSA in either TTBS\n(TBS containing 0.2% [v\/v] Tween 20) or PBST (5% [w\/v] nonfat\nmilk and 0.1% [v\/v] Tween-20 in PBS) and were incubated for 2\nh with mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP (GA-5), monoclonal anti-\nhuman GFAP (SMI-21), monoclonal anti-actin (AC-40 [Sigma]),\nor rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP antibodies (3270) diluted by 1:\n5,000 in blocking buffer. In some experiments, the mouse mono-\nclonal antibodies to the c-myc epitope (9E10, diluted by 1:100\nin blocking buffer) were used to detect tagged ubiquitin after\ntransfection. After several washes with TTBS, the membrane was\nincubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated sec-\nondary antibodies (Dako) diluted by 1:2,000 in blocking buffer,\nfollowed by washing with TBS for 30 min.

The strength of signal was quantified using\nthe Image Gauge software (v. 4.0) (FujiFilm).\nImmunoblotting of brain samples was performed using anon-\nymous, frozen tissues kindly provided by Drs.

Whereas\nwild-type GFAP assembled into typical 10-nm filaments\n(fig. 1A), R416W GFAP on its own or in combination with\nmixtures of wild-type GFAP failed to form extended fila-\nments (fig. 1B\u20131E). Instead, it formed short rod-like struc-\ntures that looked like short filament pieces that had failed\nto elongate and compact properly into 10-nm filaments\n(fig. 1E). These had a strong tendency to laterally associate\ninto aggregates (fig. 1D). Because the R416W mutation is\nheterozygous in patients with Alexander disease, we also\nassessed the assembly behavior of R416W mutant GFAP in\nthe presence of increasing proportions of wild-type GFAP.\nAt both 50:50 (fig. 1C) and 75:25 (fig. 1B) proportions of\nwild-type:R416W GFAP, normal filament assembly was\ndisrupted, and aggregates similar to those made by R416W\nGFAP alone (fig. 1D) were formed instead. These data in-\ndicate that, in vitro, the R416W mutant GFAP acts in a\ndominant manner over the wild-type protein. These data\nsuggested that the assembled R416W GFAP filaments were\nprone to aggregation; therefore, we performed a low-speed\ncentrifugation assay designed to monitor the extent of\nfilament-filament interactions in the whole filament pop-\nulation.32 With use of this assay, only approximately one-\nthird of the wild-type GFAP was found in the supernatant\nfraction (fig. 1F; e.g., lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, when\nassembled on its own, nearly all of the R416W GFAP se-\ndimented into the pellet fraction (fig. 1F; e.g., lanes 8 and\n7). High-speed centrifugation assay confirmed that the\nwild-type GFAP had assembled efficiently, because 190%\nof the protein was sedimented under standard centrifu-\ngation conditions23,27 (data not shown). Decreasing the\nproportion of mutant GFAP in mixtures with wild-type\nGFAP (fig. 1F; lanes 3\u20136) failed to markedly increase the\nproportion of soluble material.

To determine the effect of the R416W mu-\ntation on de novo IF network formation, we selected as\nthe host cells the human adrenocarcinoma-derived SW13\/\ncl.2 cell line, which does not contain any endogenous\ncytoplasmic IFs.33 When expressed in SW13\/cl.2 cells,\nwild-type GFAP formed filaments (fig. 2A), in agreement\nwith previous studies.34,35 In contrast, R416W GFAP failed\nto assemble into filaments but instead formed clusters of\ncytoplasmic aggregates (fig. 2B). Similar results were ob-\nserved when wild-type (fig. 2D) and R416W plasmids (fig.\n2E) were transiently transfected into primary astrocytes\nderived from mice lacking GFAP and vimentin.25 For com-\nparison, R239C GFAP was also transfected into both these\ncell lines (fig. 2C and 2F), and, like R416W GFAP, it also\nformed numerous cytoplasmic aggregates when the cyto-\nmegalovirus promoter was used to drive mutant GFAP ex-\npression. Previous studies have already established that\nthe R239C mutation in GFAP makes the filaments more\nstable and changes the organization of GFAP networks in\ntransfected cells. Taken together, these data suggest that\nthe R416W mutation, like the R239C mutation, affects the\nability of GFAP to self-assemble into an extended filament\nnetwork in IF-free primary cells and that this deficiency\nis independent of the cellular background.\nRecent studies have revealed that two or more IF pro-\nteins are required for the formation of most normal IF\nnetworks in vivo, including those formed by the type III\nIF proteins GFAP, desmin, and vimentin. For instance, des-\nmin requires paranemin to produce an extended IF net-\nwork in nonmuscle-derived cell lines.35 Vimentin requires\n204 The American Journal of Human Genetics Volume 79 August 2006 www.ajhg.org\nFigure 5. Analysis of wild-type and R416W GFAP expression in\ntransfected MCF7 cells by immunoblotting. MCF7 cells were trans-\nfected with either wild-type (lanes 3 and 4) or R416W GFAP (lanes\n5 and 6). Untransfected cells were used as a control (lanes 1 and\n2). At 48 h after transfection, cells were collected, lysed with MEB,\nand centrifuged at for 15 min at 4\u0003C. The resulting su-18,000 g\npernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE,\nfollowed by immunoblotting using anti-GFAP (A) and anti-actin\n(B) antibodies. The blots were developed by the ECL system. Notice\nthat, after transfection into MCF7 cells, both wild-type and mutant\nGFAP expressed at comparable levels, although proteolyzed GFAP\nfragments with slightly higher electrophoretic mobilities were also\ndetected. Most of the wild-type GFAP was detected in the pellet\nfraction (A, lane 4) with a small proportion that remained soluble\n(A, lane 3), whereas the R416W GFAP was found exclusively in the\npellet fraction (A, lane 6). Equal loading of each supernatant and\npellet fractions was confirmed by probing with anti-actin antibody\n(B).\nGFAP to form filaments in astrocytes,36 whereas, in other\ncell types, vimentin coassembles with nestin.37 Whereas\nGFAP is able to self-assemble into IFs within astrocytes\nlacking vimentin, vimentin is required for the correct\nspacing of the assembled filaments.36 Therefore, it is im-\nportant to assess the assembly behavior of GFAP in cells\ncontaining this key assembly partner.\nFor these experiments, SW13\/cl.1 cells that express vi-\nmentin IFs were selected for transient transfection studies.\nIn this cell line, wild-type GFAP assembled into filamen-\ntous networks (fig. 3A) that colocalized with the endog-\nenous vimentin IFs (fig. 3B). In contrast, most of the cells\ntransfected with R416W GFAP contained large aggregates\n(fig. 3C; arrows) with small clumps at the cell periphery\n(fig. 3C; arrowheads). These aggregates disrupted the en-\ndogenous vimentin IF networks, usually causing them to\ncollapse into a large perinuclear aggregate (Fig. 3D; arrows).\nThe finding that R416W GFAP caused the collapse of\nthe endogenous vimentin IF network led us to examine\nits effects on keratin networks, IF proteins that do not\ncoassemble with GFAP. For these experiments, we used\na human breast cancer epithelial MCF7 cell line that ex-\npresses only keratin IF proteins (K8, K18, and K19).38\nWhen transfected into this cell line, wild-type GFAP as-\nsembled into filaments that tended to bundle in most of\nthe transfected cells (fig. 4A). The GFAP filament networks\nwere found to partially coalign with the keratin IF net-\nworks (fig. 4B; arrows), which is consistent with previous\nobservations.22,27 In contrast, nearly all MCF cells express-\ning R416W mutant GFAP formed aggregates (fig. 4C; ar-\nrows) that often collapsed the endogenous keratin IF\nnetworks (fig. 4D; arrows). These results suggest that the\nR416W mutation not only impaired the ability of GFAP\nto form normal IF network but also revealed a dominant\neffect on endogenous keratin filament networks in the\nabsence of any obvious coassembly.\nThe relative expression levels and solubility of the wild-\ntype and the R416W GFAP were determined by immuno-\nblotting of extracts from MCF7 cells prepared using a mild\nlysis buffer protocol. Analysis of both supernatant and\npellet fractions revealed no endogenous GFAP expressed\nin nontransfected MCF7 cells (fig. 5A; lanes 1 and 2). In\ncontrast, cells transfected with either wild-type (fig. 5A;\nlanes 3 and 4) or R416W (fig. 5A; lanes 5 and 6) GFAP\ngenerated proteins of the expected size at comparable lev-\nels, suggesting that aggregate formation is likely due to the\nmutation per se rather than elevated expression levels.\nAlthough a small fraction of wild-type GFAP remained in\nthe supernatant fraction (fig. 5A; lane 3), R416W GFAP\nwas found exclusively in the pellet fraction (fig. 5A; lane\n6), consistent with its sequestration into cytoplasmic ag-\ngregates. Equal loading for the various supernatant and\npellet fractions was verified using an anti-actin antibody\n(fig. 5B).\nAnalysis of R416W GFAP Aggregates in MCF7 Cells\nby Electron Microscopy\nThe high transfection efficiency of both wild-type and\nR416W GFAP in MCF7 cells allowed us to further analyze\nthe ultrastructural organization of GFAP by immunoelec-\ntron microscopy. MCF7 cells transfected with plasmids ex-\npressing either the wild-type or the R416W GFAP were\nprocessed for immunogold labeling with anti-GFAP anti-\nbodies followed by protein A conjugated with 5-nm gold\nparticles. In cells expressing wild-type GFAP, fibrous re-\ngions consisting of 10-nm filaments were observed (fig.\n6A and 6B). These filaments were organized into bun-\ndles that traversed the cytoplasm (fig. 6A). At a higher\nmagnification, individual filaments were decorated with\ngold particles (fig. 6B; arrows), confirming the presence\nof GFAP in these filaments. In contrast, cells expressing\nR416W GFAP displayed electron-dense aggregates, distrib-\nuted throughout the cytoplasm (fig. 6C; arrows), that were\noften accompanied by IFs (fig. 6C; asterisks). At a higher\nmagnification, these electron-dense aggregates appear as\namorphous membrane-free structures composed of aggre-\ngated GFAP, as evidenced by the presence of gold particles\n(fig. 6D; arrows).\nwww.ajhg.org The American Journal of Human Genetics Volume 79 August 2006 205\nFigure 6.

Immunogold labeling of ultrathin sections was stained and visualized by a transmission electron\nmicroscope. Wild-type GFAP assembled into filaments that were organized into parallel bundles (A). In contrast, cells expressing the\nR416W mutant formed membrane-free irregular-shaped structures composed of electron-dense aggregates at the perinuclear region (C),\noften in association with IFs (asterisks [*] in C). Panels B and D are higher magnification views of the boxed areas of panels A and C,\nrespectively, showing that both the filaments (B) and aggregates (D) were decorated with 5-nm gold particles (arrows in B and D),\nconfirming the identity of GFAP.\nEffects of R416W GFAP on Endogenous GFAP Networks\nin Primary Astrocytes\nThe assembly behavior of R416W GFAP was also examined\nin mouse primary astrocytes, to test the effects of endog-\nenous wild-type GFAP and vimentin IFs on the aggrega-\ntion process. The distribution of transfected GFAP in re-\nlation to the endogenous GFAP was visualized by double-\nlabel immunofluorescence microscopy with use of mono-\nclonal antibody SMI-21 (fig. 7A and 7C), which specifically\nrecognizes human GFAP, and polyclonal anti-panGFAP\nantibody, which recognizes both the endogenous mouse\nGFAP and the transfected human GFAP (fig. 7B and 7D).\nMouse astrocytes transiently transfected with wild-type\nGFAP mainly formed filaments (fig. 7A) that colocalized\nwith the endogenous GFAP network (fig. 7B; arrows). In\ncontrast, the effects of R416W GFAP expression in astro-\ncytes were similar to those observed for the vimentin-con-\ntaining SW13\/cl.1 cells. Most of the transfected cells con-\ntained cytoplasmic aggregates with smaller particles at the\ncell periphery (fig. 7C), which colocalized with collapsed\nendogenous GFAP networks (fig. 7C and 7D; arrows). In\nsome transfected cells, however, expressed R416W GFAP\nwas incorporated into the endogenous GFAP networks\nwithout any apparent changes (fig. 7C and 7D; cell on the\nright).

To follow the fate of the human R416W GFAP\nin the presence of the endogenous wild-type human GFAP,\nwe sought to develop mouse monoclonal antibodies that\nspecifically recognized human R416W GFAP but not wild-\ntype GFAP, and vice versa (see the \u201cMaterial and Methods\u201d\nsection for details). The immunogen specific for the wild\ntype failed to elicit any GFAP monoclonal antibodies. The\nR416W GFAP peptide, however, yielded two monoclonal\nantibodies, 19.2 and 1A3, that recognized R416W GFAP\nbut not wild-type GFAP, as judged by immunoblots of pu-\nrified, recombinant proteins (fig. 8A). In addition, neither\nof these monoclonal antibodies crossreacted with a lysate\nfrom a normal brain or with a lysate from a brain con-\ntaining another GFAP mutation commonly associated with\nAlexander disease, R239C, and both produced signals from\nlysates of R416W brain that were nearly identical to those\nof the control SMI-21 monoclonal antibody (fig. 8A).

A, Immunoblots,\nperformed as described in the \u201cMaterial and Methods\u201d section, with use of purified, recombinant human wild-type (hGF-WT) and R416W\n(hGF-R416W) GFAP and lysates from brain samples taken from either control human (WT) or patients with Alexander disease that harbor\neither an R239C mutation (R239C) or an R416W mutation (R416W) in GFAP. The general anti-human GFAP monoclonal antibody (SMI-\n21) reacts with all samples, whereas the anti-R416W monoclonal antibodies (1A3 and 19.2) produce signals from R416W-containing\nsamples only, with the pattern for the R416W patient lysate identical to that of SMI-21. The identity of the immunopositive bands\nabove and below the prominent GFAP-positive band are as yet unknown. The lower bands most likely correspond to degradation products,\nsince these are normally seen in control brain samples. The upper bands are common to both the R239C and R416W samples, suggesting\nthese are a common feature of Alexander disease pathology, but, as yet, the reason for their slower electrophoretic mobility is unknown.\nPanels B and C are striatum in a control (normal) brain stained with standard polyclonal GFAP antibody (B) and by R416W monoclonal\nantibody 19.2 (C). Note that the R416W antibody does not crossreact with normal human brain tissue. Panels D\u2013F are brain sections\nfrom a patient with the R416W GFAP mutation that are stained with the monoclonal 19.2 antibody and then are visualized by either\nperoxidase- (D) or rhodamine-tagged secondary antibodies (F) or are stained with the rabbit polyclonal GFAP antibody (Dako) and then\nare detected with FITC-tagged secondary antibodies (E). Nuclei are counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (E and F [see the \u201cMaterial and\nMethods\u201d section for procedure details]) to assist comparison of the panels E and F. Numerous Rosenthal fibers are stained around their\nperiphery (arrows in E and F), a feature often reported for these aggregates (e.g., the work of Tomokane et al.6). Normal-looking GFAP\nfilaments are also stained by the R416W-specific mAb (arrowheads in F) and can be detected by the diffuse staining in other parts of\nthe section.\n208 The American Journal of Human Genetics Volume 79 August 2006 www.ajhg.org\nsignal was produced with the R416W antibody (fig. 8C),\nconfirming the immunoblot results that the R416W anti-\nbody does not crossreact with normal human brain GFAP.\nOn the other hand, the R416W antibody strongly stained\nbrain from a patient with Alexander disease who harbored\nan R416W mutation, with use of either peroxidase (fig.\n8D) or fluorescent (fig. 8F) detection methods. This stain-\ning was apparent both along the periphery of the Rosen-\nthal fibers and in normal-appearing filaments (fig. 8F) and\nlargely colocalized with staining of total GFAP (fig. 8E).\nThese data confirm the specificity of the R416W antibod-\nies produced. Importantly, they also demonstrate, for the\nfirst time, that the mutant protein is stably expressed in\npatients with the R416W mutation and that it is incor-\nporated into both filaments and Rosenthal fibers.\nAssembly Properties of Mutant GFAP Expressed in Human\nCells Containing Endogenous GFAP Filament Networks\nThese R416W GFAP\u2013specific monoclonal antibodies also\npermitted us to follow the fate of R416W GFAP when tran-\nsiently expressed in human astrocytoma U343MG cells.\nThis cell system would be expected to better mimic the\nscenario of R416W GFAP being expressed in a human\nastrocyte cell background and removes potential species\nconflicts. In this model system, R416W GFAP induced the\nformation of GFAP-rich aggregates (fig. 9A and 9B; arrows).\nThese data show that R416W GFAP is capable of disrupting\nthe endogenous networks of wild-type GFAP filaments\nwithin the context of a human astrocytoma cell line and\nonce again demonstrate the dominant negative potential\nof the mutant R416W GFAP on the endogenous IFs.\nSimilarities between the R416W-Induced Aggregates\nin Transfected Cells and Rosenthal Fibers\nIn previous studies of Alexander disease pathology, several\nother proteins were found to associate with Rosenthal fi-\nbers, including the small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) aB-\ncrystallin6 and HSP27.40 We investigated whether these\nproteins would associate with the aggregates of R416W\nGFAP formed in the U343MG astrocytoma cells (fig. 9C\u2013\n9F). Both aB-crystallin (fig. 9D; arrows) and HSP27 (fig.\n9F; arrows) colocalized with the GFAP-containing aggre-\ngates in these cells (fig. 9C and 9E, respectively; arrows).\nRosenthal fibers are also ubiquitinated.6 That the GFAP\naggregates in transfected cells are also ubiquitinated was\ndemonstrated by cotransfection of His6-myc tagged ubi-\nquitin26 along with R416W GFAP into the human astro-\ncytoma cells (fig. 9G and 9H; arrows). Thus, the aggregates\nformed by R416W GFAP in the transiently transfected hu-\nman astrocytoma cells have many features reported else-\nwhere and expected for Rosenthal fibers.41\nTo obtain biochemical evidence of the similarities be-\ntween the Rosenthal fibers in patients and the R416W\nGFAP aggregates formed in the transfected U343MG cells,\nwe extracted the cells and monitored the solubility of the\nGFAP and the associated protein chaperones (fig. 9I). With\nuse of an extraction buffer containing deoxycholate, wild-\ntype GFAP was almost completely extracted from both the\nuntransfected (fig. 9I; Mock) and wild-type GFAP trans-\nfected cells (fig. 9I; WT), conditions that also extracted aB-\ncrystallin, HSP27, and HSP70 (fig. 9I; Mock and WT). In\ncontrast, R416W GFAP remained entirely in the pellet frac-\ntion of the extracted cells that had been transiently trans-\nfected with R416W GFAP (fig. 9I; R416W). Interestingly,\nwhen the immunoblots of the supernatant and pellet frac-\ntions were also probed with antibodies toaB-crystallin (fig.\n9I; aB-cry), HSP27 (fig. 9I; HSP27), and HSP70 (fig. 9I;\nHSP70), a significant proportion of both aB-crystallin and\nHSP27\u2014but not HSP70\u2014remained in the pellet fractions\nof R416W GFAP\u2013transfected cells (fig. 9I; R416W). These\ndata show that a proportion of both sHSPs is associated\nwith the insoluble R416W GFAP. Since HSP7027 was com-\npletely extracted from the R416W GFAP\u2013transfected cells\nunder these conditions (fig. 9I; HSP70), the association of\nthe sHSPs with R416W GFAP is specific and not a general\nproperty for all protein chaperones.\nDiscussion\nThe R416W Mutation in GFAP: A Dominant Mutation That\nAffects Interfilament Interactions\nIn this study, we investigated the properties of the com-\nmon Alexander disease\u2013causing R416W GFAP mutation\nto obtain insights into the initial stages of the disease pro-\ncess. We demonstrated that this R416W GFAP mutation\ndramatically alters assembly, both in vitro and in trans-\nfected cells (figs. 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9), and does so in a dom-\ninant manner. The mutant protein can also disturb en-\ndogenous IF networks in cultured cells, including those of\nvimentin (fig. 3D), keratin (fig. 4), and GFAP (figs. 7 and\n9A). The effects of R416W GFAP are different in several\nrespects from those of R239C, the only other Alexander\ndisease\u2013causing mutation that has been studied in detail.21\nWhen assembled in vitro, the R239C mutant formed IFs\nthat appeared indistinguishable from wild-type filaments,21\nwhereas the R416W GFAP formed short filament inter-\nmediates that associated laterally (fig. 1). Despite this dif-\nference, we show here that both the R239C and the R416W\nGFAP form aggregates when expressed in either the vi-\nmentin-negative SW13\/cl.2 cell line or the primary mouse\nastrocytes lacking both vimentin and GFAP (fig. 2), con-\nfirming some of the results in a previous study.21 When\nR239C GFAP was transiently expressed in primary rat as-\ntrocytes, however, its assembly properties were not radi-\ncally different from those of transiently expressed wild-\ntype GFAP.21 In contrast, we found that the R416W mu-\ntant invariably formed aggregates when transiently over-\nexpressed in several different cell lines, including primary\nmouse astrocytes (figs. 2 and 7) and human astrocytoma\ncells (fig. 9B). Despite these differences, both mutations\nwere found to increase the resistance of GFAP to extraction\n(figs. 5 and 9I).21 Taken together, these data indicate that,\nwhereas the immediate structural consequences of differ-\nFigure 9. The similarity between Rosenthal fibers and GFAP aggregates formed in transfected human astrocytoma cells. U343MG cells\nwere transiently transfected with R416W GFAP and were routinely stained with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (3270) to GFAP (A, C, E,\nand G) and then were double stained with mouse monoclonal antibodies specific to R416W GFAP (B), aB-crystallin (aB-cry) (D), or\nHSP27 (F). Notice that the GFAP containing aggregates are also positive for both aB-crystallin and HSP27 (arrows in C\u2013F). To demonstrate\nthe presence of ubiquitin in the GFAP aggregates, cells were cotransfected with His6-myc ubiquitin as well as R416W GFAP and then\nwere stained with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to GFAP (G) and the mouse monoclonal antibodies that recognize the myc epitope (H),\nshowing that the GFAP aggregates contain ubiquitin. Barsp 10 mm. I, Wild-type and R416W GFAP (R416W) were transiently expressed\nin the human astrocyte cell line U343MG, and supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions were prepared from these culture and were\ncompared with mock transfected cells. Cell fractionation used HEB, which almost completely solubilized wild-type GFAP. R416W GFAP,\non the other hand, remained in the pellet fraction. Immunoblots of the cell fractions were probed with antibodies to GFAP, aB-crystallin,\nHSP27, HSP70, and finally actin, which was used as a loading control. Notice that, when cells were transfected with R416W GFAP, a\nsignificant proportion of the HSP27 and aB-crystallin but not HSP70 remained in the pellet fraction along with the R416W GFAP. Both\nthe sHSPs and R416W GFAP were more resistant to extraction compared with these proteins in the wild-type GFAP transfected cells.

GFAP aggregation caused by the R416W mutation\ninduces sHSP association and the association of ubiquitin as early\nevents in the etiology of Alexander disease. The presence of the\nR416W GFAP mutation decreases the solubility of the GFAP fila-\nments, probably by altering the filament-filament interactions in\na manner that encourages aggregation. This is accompanied by\nthe sequestration of the sHSP protein chaperones\u2014aB-crystallin\nand HSP27 (shaded circles)\u2014and GFAP into aggregates. Both pro-\nteins also localize to Rosenthal fibers, which also contain ubiquitin\n(Ub). The filament aggregates undergo a maturing process, with\nthe additional posttranslational modification of integral compo-\nnents, such as the phosphorylation64 and ubiquitination8 of aB-\ncrystallin to form the Rosenthal fibers. The model is not exclusive\nto R416W GFAP, since Rosenthal fibers are a characteristic diag-\nnostic feature of Alexander disease.12 Other GFAP mutations differ\nin the details of the mechanism by which they produce aberrant\nfilament-filament interactions leading to the formation of stabi-\nlized aggregates, but, once formed, they then follow a common\npathway to Rosenthal fiber formation. Increased GFAP filament\nstability and the specific association of sHSPs are predicted to be\nthe earliest events in the development of Alexander disease. (A\ncolor version of this figure is available in the online edition of\nthe journal.)\nent GFAP mutations are likely to differ, as has been found\nfor other intermediate filament proteins,10,42,43 there will\nlikely be common consequences that lead to Alexander\ndisease.\nThe RDG-Containing Motif and Its Role in Filament\nAssembly\nThe R416W mutation lies within the RDG motif that is\nconserved within the tail domain of nearly all of the type\nIII IF proteins. Previous studies of GFAP had concluded\nthat the RDG motif was important to filament assembly,\nbut only in the context of the rest of the C-terminal do-\nmain.44 Our assembly data, presented here, show that\nchanging the precise sequence of this motif to WDG does\nhave dramatic effects on GFAP assembly (figs. 1 and 2).\nChange of the equivalent arginine (R449) to proline in\nvimentin also severely disrupted the in vitro assembly and\nnetwork formation in transiently transfected cells.45 These\ncombined data suggest that this arginine residue in the\nRDG motif within the C-terminal domain is very impor-\ntant for the assembly IF proteins with the motif.\nPrevious studies proposed that the C-terminal domain\nassociates intramolecularly with the C-terminal end of the\nrod domain.46 Crystallization of the helix IIB rod domain\nsuggests that the two a helices fold away from the dimer\naxis,17 which is consistent with the hypothesis that the\nC-terminal domain could form a surface-exposed loop\nstructure and prevent inappropriate subunit interactions\nin the self-assembly process.46 This offers an explanation\nof the altered width of vimentin filaments assembled from\ntail-truncated and deleted forms of vimentin47 and the\nchanged in vitro assembly characteristics of the R416W\nGFAP we report here (fig. 1).\nOur studies also suggest that the RDG motif will con-\ntribute to interfilament interactions as well as subunit or-\nganization within the IF. We have demonstrated the in-\ncreased tendency of R416W GFAP to aggregate in vitro\n(fig. 1) as well as in transfected cells (figs. 2, 4, 7, and 9).\nStudies of keratins also show that the C-terminal domain\nis very important in promoting filament-filament inter-\nactions.48\u201350 Together with our data presented here, a con-\nsensus is thus beginning to emerge that C-terminal se-\nquences of cytoplasmic IFs help regulate both intra- and\ninterfilament associations.\nThe Mutant R416W GFAP: A Component of Rosenthal\nFibers\nThe presence of Rosenthal fibers has been documented in\ntwo cases of Alexander disease caused by the R416W GFAP\nmutation.6,9,51 For one of these cases, we show, for the first\ntime for any Alexander disease case, that the mutant GFAP\nis present as the defining histopathological feature (fig. 8D\nand 8F). This is also the first time for any IF-based human\ndisease that the link between the presence of the mutated\nprotein and a characteristic histopathogical IF aggregate\nhas been rigorously shown. In a case of epidermolysis bul-\nlosa simplex, a keratin-blistering disease, the loss of an\nepitope was used to confirm the genotype of patients,52\nbut this reagent was unable to demonstrate the presence\nof the mutant keratin 5 in the aggregates found in kera-\ntinocytes. Another study described the generation of a poly-\nclonal antibody specific for a keratin 8 variant (R340H),\nwhich may predispose carriers to liver disease,53 but these\nwww.ajhg.org The American Journal of Human Genetics Volume 79 August 2006 211\nantibodies were used only for immunblotting studies.\nEven in the case of Mallory bodies formed as a result of\nalcoholic hepatitis, where antibodies were developed that\nselectively stained the Mallory bodies and not the sur-\nrounding keratin filaments, the antibodies still detected\nwild-type keratins.54 Our antibody reagents are therefore\nthe first to specifically identify a mutant missense IF pro-\ntein in the presence of its wild-type counterpart. These\nantibodies allowed us to demonstrate that the mutant pro-\ntein is a component of Rosenthal fibers in human patient\nbrain tissue (fig. 8D and 8F) and also in GFAP-containing\naggregates of transfected human astrocytoma cells (fig.\n9B).\nAssociation of aB-Crystallin and HSP27 with R416W GFAP\nAggregates\nWe also discovered that the protein chaperones aB-crys-\ntallin and HSP27 specifically associate with the GFAP ag-\ngregates that are formed in transfected cells that express\nR416W GFAP. Both chaperones are components of Ro-\nsenthal fibers found in patients, including those with the\nR416W mutation.6,40 These chaperones normally minimize\nfilament-filament associations,27 and their overexpression\ncan dissolve accumulations of wild-type GFAP filaments.55\nTheir presence, however, in both brain astrocytes of pa-\ntients with Alexander disease and in cultured cells does\nnot prevent the changes in GFAP-filament solubility, fil-\nament aggregation, or the formation of Rosenthal fibers\nby R416W GFAP. The association of HSP27 and aB-crys-\ntallin with R416W GFAP and resistance to extraction is\nlikely due to the altered filament properties induced by\nthis mutation. Although other stresses have been shown\nto stimulate the association of both HSP27 and aB-crys-\ntallin with GFAP filaments,27,40 those studies involved wild-\ntype proteins. Our data show that it is specifically the\npresence of the R416W GFAP, and not wild-type GFAP,\nthat both stabilizes GFAP and leads to the sequestration\nof sHSPs (figs. 9C\u20139F and 9I).\nThe sequestration of HSP27 and aB-crystallin could po-\ntentially compromise the astrocyte stress response and\ntherefore contribute to the initiation of Alexander disease.\nFor example, it has already been shown that either the\nreduction of HSP27 or the loss of aB-crystallin compro-\nmises cytoskeletal integrity and function56 or induces mus-\ncular atrophy,57 respectively. HSP27 is a key protein in\nprotecting cells, including neurons,58 against apoptosis by\ninhibiting caspase activity59 and preserving mitochondrial\nfunction.60 HSP27 has also been implicated in regulating\nthe stress response through the ubiquitin-mediated pro-\nteosomal regulation of the key transcription factor, NFkB.61\nImportantly, HSP27 protects cells against other protein\naggregation\u2013based diseases caused by huntingtin62 and a-\nsynuclein.63 Such studies identify diminution of sHSP lev-\nels as a potential Achilles\u2019 heel in the cellular response to\nprotein aggregate\u2013based diseases that require either up-\nregulation58 or overexpression63 to ameliorate the disease\nphenotype. These observations suggest that the early se-\nquestration of sHSPs into GFAP aggregates (this study) and\nRosenthal fibers6 is a key event at the onset of Alexander\ndisease. Figure 10 incorporates these ideas into a diagram\nof the events that we believe to be important in the early\nstages of Alexander disease.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Dr. R. M.
