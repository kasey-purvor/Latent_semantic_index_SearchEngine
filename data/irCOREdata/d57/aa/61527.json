Active dissolution of these deposits can occur on a human rather than \na geological timescale causing subsidence and building damage. The British Geological \nSurvey has taken two approaches towards understanding and advising on hazards caused \nby dissolution of these soluble rocks. At a detailed level, a national database and GIS of \nkarstic features is being populated. Information gathered includes dolines, springs, stream \nsinks, caves and building damage. At a national level, the soluble rocks in Great Britain \nhave been identified and digital-map polygon information relating to them has been \nextracted from the British 1:50,000-scale digital map. These areas have been assessed, \nand in places their margins extended to include some overlying rocks where subsidence \nfeatures are known to penetrate upwards through the overlying sequence. The national \nareas have then been assessed using the detailed local information to assign a \nsusceptibility rating from A (extremely low) to E (high), depending on the nature and \nregularity of the subsidence events that occur. This national zonation of the soluble rocks \ncan be used for planning, construction and the insurance businesses. It has also proved \nuseful for assessing the potential stability of linear routes, such as roads and pipelines or \nfor other important structures such as bridges and buildings. The information can also be \nused to delineate zone of karstic groundwater flow. \n \nKeywords: Evaporite; Karst; Subsidence; GIS; Hazard assessment \n \n \n Introduction \n \nEngineering problems, such as subsidence, and irregular rockhead developed over soluble \n(karstic) rocks, pose difficulties for planning and development and can be very expensive \nfor the construction and insurance industries. At their most extreme they can cause \nproperties to collapse and put lives at risk. The carbonate rocks (mainly limestone and \nchalk) are well known for their karstic development, however, karst in gypsum and salt \nare less well known. These rocks dissolve faster and are much more soluble, allowing \nkarst to develop very quickly in these rock types. To understand the problems associated \nwith soluble rocks in Great Britain, the British Geological Survey (BGS) is constructing a \ndatabase of karst features. This has been utilised in conjunction with digital geological \nmap and scientific information to generate a karst hazard susceptibility map of Great \nBritain. The map and karst database are important for understanding the severity of the \nproblem and constitute useful tools for hazard avoidance that have relevance to planning, \nengineering, development and the insurance industry.  Developers, planners and the local \ngovernment can only operate effectively if they know about the hazards that affect them \nand have access to suitable geological information. The British Geological Survey is the \nmain national supplier of this geological and geohazard data. \n \nEvaporite karst in Great Britain \n \nBecause evaporite rocks are highly soluble, areas underlain by them in the Great Britain \ntend to form low ground, which is often extensively covered with superficial deposits. \nThe evaporites are not often seen at outcrop, but can be mapped from borehole data and \nmay be inferred from the sinkholes or dolines that develop across the outcrops and on the \noverlying strata. The main evaporite deposits at and near outcrop in the Great Britain \ninclude Permian gypsum, Triassic gypsum and Triassic salt sequences (Figure 1). They \nall dissolve to varying degrees depending on the local geological and hydrogeological \nsituation. Gypsum also occurs in some Jurassic rocks in southern Britain, where some \nevidence of dissolution and tectonic brecciation exists in the form brecciated strata \nknown as the Broken Beds (West 1964), but no evidence of modern dissolution or \nsubsidence has been noted. \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Distribution of the main evaporite karst sequences at outcrop in England \n \nPermian gypsum karst \n \nIn northeast England, karst developed in Permian gypsum occurs in a belt about 3km \nwide and 100km long stretching from just north of Doncaster in the south to Hartlepool \nin the north. The Permian sequence (Figure 2) comprises two thick units of gypsum \nunderlain by dolomite aquifers. The gypsum is heavily karstified especially in places \nwhere the major rivers and buried valleys have cut through the Permian sequence \nproducing major pathways for the escape of groundwater from the bedrock into the \nfluvial system. By comparison with known phreatic gypsum cave systems (such as those \nin the Ukraine, Klimchouk et al 1997) and from the pattern of subsidence, it is inferred \nthat there are phreatic cave systems in the gypsum caused by the allogenic recharge from \nthe adjacent ground, particularly the dip slopes of the dolomite aquifers and the overlying \nsandstone aquifer, into major the valleys. The rapid solubility rate of the gypsum means \nthat the karst is evolving on a human time scale and active subsidence occurs in many \nplaces, especially around the town of Ripon (Cooper 1986, 1989, 1998). The active \nnature of the dissolution and the ongoing subsidence features here cause difficult ground \nconditions for planning and development (Thompson et al 1996, Paukstys et al 1997, \nCooper 1998) and for road and bridge construction (Cooper and Saunders 2002, Jones \nand Cooper 2005). In this area water abstraction can aggravate the problem and lead to \nenhanced dissolution and collapse (Cooper 1988). Gypsum karst is also present in the \nPermian rocks of the Vale of Eden (Ryder and Cooper 1993), but here it is less extensive \nas the gypsum is sandwiched within a mudstone sequence, which restricts the passage of \nwater through the gypsum.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Cross-section through the typical Permian gypsum sequence at Ripon, North \nYorkshire. The Dolomite at the base of the sequence is the Cadeby Formation, which is \noverlain by gypsum and mudstone of the Edlington Formation, dolomite and dolomitic \nlimestone of the Brotherton Formation, gypsum and mudstone of the Roxby Formation. \nThe Permian sequence is capped by the arenaceous Sherwood Sandstone Group of \nTriassic age. The sequence is cut into by the buried valley of the River Ure and \nperforated by breccia pipes caused by collapse following gypsum dissolution. \n \nTriassic gypsum karst  \n \nGypsum karst is present in the Triassic strata, but the effects of it are much less severe \nthan those in the Permian rocks. The difference is mainly caused by the thickness of \nTriassic gypsum (typically less than 5m) and the fact it is interbedded with mainly \nweakly permeable mudstone sequences (Figure 3). In places subsidence does occur with \nsinkholes largely triggered by the infiltration of surface water carrying down fine material \ninto subsurface cavities. Leakage of water from installations such as power generation \nstations has been recorded to have aggravated dissolution and caused subsidence \n(Seedhouse and Sanders 1993). The presence of gypsum karst has also produced difficult \nground conditions for road construction south of Derby (Cooper and Saunders 2002).  \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Cross-section through Triassic gypsiferous strata of the Cropwell Bishop \nFormation (Mercia Mudstone Group) south of Derby. The gypsum caps the hill and is \nslightly dissolved capping in the south where it has also been mined. To the north there is \na zone of greater dissolution, approximately at the present water table and down-dip from \nthis the amount of dissolution decreases and the amount of gypsum increases.  \n \nTriassic salt karst  \n \nSalt near surface in Great Britain occurs mainly in the Triassic strata of central and north-\nwestern England. The towns on the Triassic salt strata commonly have \u201cwich\u201d or \u201cwych\u201d \nin their names, a term derived from the old English word for a salt spring. These names \nindicate that the towns are sited on former salt springs, which emanated from the actively \ndissolving salt karst (Cooper 2002). Starting with the exploitation of natural brine, these \nsaline spring sites later became the focus for shallow mining and near-surface brine \nextraction (Figure 4). The method used was to sink wells or drill boreholes to intersect \nthe near surface \u201cbrine runs\u201d a technique that was called \u201cwild\u201d brine extraction and \nwhich exacerbated the salt karstification (Arup Geotechnics 1991, Calvert 1915, Collins \n1971). The exploitation of \u201cwild\u201d brine has resulted in near-linear belts of subsidence \ntrending towards the abstraction point and partly controlled by the geological structure. \nMost extraction of natural brine has ceased and modern exploitation is mainly in dry \nmines or by deep controlled brine extraction leaving brine-filled cavities. Since the \ncessation of natural brine pumping, the saline ground water levels have returned towards \ntheir pre-pumping state. Brine springs are becoming re-established and natural \nkarstification and subsidence may be expected to occur though heavily influenced by the \nman-made brine runs.  \n \n \n \nFigure 4. Cross-section though Triassic salt deposits in Cheshire. At wet rockhead there \nis a zone of intense dissolution and collapse where the salt is overlain by brecciated and \ncollapsed strata. \n \nThe karst database and GIS \n \nIt has been recognised for some time that the availability of baseline data is essential for \nthe assessment of geological hazards. Guidance for the development on unstable land is \nwritten into British Government planning policy  in the \u201cPlanning policy guidance note \n14: Development on unstable land\u201d  (Department of the Environment 1990), and the \nsupplementary \u201cAnnex 2\u201d (Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions \n2002). To underpin this policy, rudimentary baseline data was collected in an initial \ndatabase of natural cavities commissioned by the Department of the Environment and \nproduced by Applied Geology Ltd (1993). This study showed the national distribution of \nkarst and other natural cavities, but did not include all the detail that was available and \nsome of the spatial recording was not very accurate. Consequently, in 2000, the British \nGeological Survey embarked on constructing a more comprehensive Geographic \nInformation System (GIS) and database of karst information (Cooper et al 2001). Over \nthe past 6 years this system has been populated and karst features for most of the \nevaporite areas have been added; in addition, about one quarter of the limestone and half \nof the chalk karst in the country has been included in the database.  \n Information gathered during fieldwork is either recorded digitally on portable tablet \ncomputers or on proforma field data sheets that have the same data fields as the GIS and \nits underlying database. Data is gathered either in the field or from existing datasets such \nas scanned and georegistered copies of the geologists field maps, historical and modern \ngeoregistered Ordnance Survey maps, papers and historical documents. The information \nis added directly into the GIS and five categories of data are collected: dolines or \nsinkholes, springs, stream sinks, caves and building damage. \n \nThe data is entered into the GIS using the British Geological Survey desktop data capture \nmethodology, the \u201cGeological Spatial Database\u201d (GSD) system, developed by Keith \nAdlam; initially using ArcView3 (Cooper et al 2001), this system has now been migrated \nto ArcGIS9. The data is stored in ArcGIS format on central servers, but the point \ninformation and database tables are also copied to centralised Oracle databases to allow \ncompatibility with the main BGS datasets. In common with all BGS databases, the \ninformation added to the system has common header data including National Grid co-\nordinates, date entered, user ID and reliability (this is not shown on tables 1-5 below).  \n \nFor dolines and sinkholes, the data can be gathered either as a point for a small collapse, \nor depending on the scale as a polygon for more extensive areas. Once a point or polygon \nis captured, the GSD presents a drop down list of information to be populated. The details \ngathered are shown in tables 1 (Dolines or sinkholes), 2 (springs), 3 (stream sinks), 4 \n(caves) and 5 (building damage) listed below.  The size of springs and stream sinks are \nrecorded, but it is generally subjective and weather dependent on the time of year and \nrecent rainfall. Furthermore, for the majority of historical information gathered from \npublished maps and geologist field maps, no precise description of spring or stream sink \nflow is given.  Information gathered for caves is also collected as either point data for \ncave entrances, or if it is known, as linear data for the approximate centre lines of the \ncaves themselves. The functionality is there in the software to include full cave plans, but \ncommonly these have copyright restrictions and cannot be included. Many of the doline \nand sinkhole affected areas also suffer from building damage and damage to \ninfrastructure. \n \nSinkholes: record item Parameters \nSinkhole Name Free text \nSize  Size x, Size y, Size z, metres. \nType Compound, collapse, suffusion, solution, no data, buried \nShape Round, oval, irregular, modified, compound, no data. \nSurface profile Pipe, cone, inverted cone, saucer, complex, levelled (filled), no data \nInfill deposits British Geological Survey rock and stratigraphical codes with \nthicknesses \nSubsidence type Gradual, episodic, instantaneous, no data \nEvidence of quarrying Yes, no, no data. \nPrimary data source Field mapping, air-photo, site-investigation, database, maps and \nsurveys, literature, Lidar remote sensing, DoE database, no data. \nReliability Good, probable, poor, no data \nProperty damage Yes, no, no data \nOldest recorded subsidence dd\/mm\/yyyy \nIntermediate subsidence events dd\/mm\/yyyy \nMost recent subsidence  dd\/mm\/yyyy \nOther data Free text \nReferences Free text \nTable 1 datafields gathered for dolines or sinkholes. \n \nSprings; record item Parameters \nSpring name Free text \nElevation  Metres \nSituation Open surface, borehole, concealed, submerged, submarine, \nunderground inlet, no data \nProven dye trace Yes, no \nFlow Ephemeral, fluctuating, constant, flood overflow, ebbing & flowing, \nno data \nWater type Normal\/fresh, saline, sulphate, tufaceous, other mineral, no data \nSize Trickle, small stream, medium stream, large stream, small river, \nmedium river, large river, no data \nPrimary data source Field mapping, air-photo, site-investigation, database, maps and \nsurveys, literature, Lidar remote sensing, DoE database, no data. \nArtesian Yes, no, no data \nThermal Yes, no, no data \nKarstic Yes, no, no data \nUses None, public, agricultural, industrial, other, no data. \nCharacter Single discrete, multiple discrete, diffuse, no data \nReliability  Good, probable, poor, no data \nEstimated discharge Litres per second (ls \u20131) \nOther data Free text \nReferences Free text \nTable 2 datafields gathered for springs \n \n \nStream sinks; record item Parameters \nSink name Free text \nElevation Metres \nProven dye traces Yes, no, no data \nMorphology Discrete compound, discrete single sink, diffuse sink, losing stream, \nponded sink, cave entrance, concealed sink, no data \nFlow Perennial, intermittent, ephemeral (flood), Estavelle, no data \nSize Trickle, small stream, medium stream, large stream, small river, \nmedium river, large river, no data \nPrimary data source Field mapping, air-photo, site-investigation, database, maps and \nsurveys, literature, Lidar remote sensing, DoE database, no data \nReliability Good, probable, poor, no data \nEstimated discharge Litres per second (ls \u20131) \nOther data Free text \nReferences Free text \nTable 3 datafields gathered for stream sinks  \n \nNatural cavities, record item Parameters \nCavity name Free text \nLength Metres \nVertical range Metres \nElevation Metres \nType Open cave natural, infilled cave natural, gull cave, lava tube, \nboulder, peat cave, sea cave, stoping cavity, palaeokarst, \nhydrothermal, borehole cavity, no data. \nRock units penetrated (solid and \ndrift) \nBritish Geological Survey rock and stratigraphical codes  \nPrimary data source Field mapping, air-photo, site-investigation, database, maps and \nsurveys, literature, Lidar remote sensing, DoE database, no data \nStreamway Yes, no, no data \nOther entrance Yes, no, no data \nEvidence of mining Yes, no, no data \nReliability Good, probable, poor, no data \nOther data Free text \nReferences Free text \nTable 4 datafields gathered for natural cavities \nProperty damage, record item Parameters \nAddress Free text \nPostcode Postcode format \nElevation Metres \nDamage survey 1 Date (dd\/mm\/yyyy), notes, Damage rating (1-7) \nDamage survey 2 Date (dd\/mm\/yyyy), notes, Damage rating (1-7) \nDamage survey 3 Date (dd\/mm\/yyyy), notes, Damage rating (1-7) \nSuspected cause Natural subsidence, mining subsidence, landslip, compressible fill, \nbuilding defect \nReliability Good, probable, poor, no data \nOther data Free text \nReferences Free text \nTable 5 datafields gathered for property damage \n \nThe GIS allows building damage to be recorded and has the functionality to allow this to \nbe done on one, two or three occasions allowing multi-temporal analysis of the data. The \nproforma and GIS allow information on suspected cause and reliability to be included. \nThe methodology and dataset is also applicable to mining and landslip subsidence and the \nrecording scheme has been designed to cope with information from those sources. The \nbuilding damage classification has 7 classes. The first 5 classes are based on the National \nCoal Board (NCB 1975) Subsidence Engineers Handbook classification. This has been \nextended to include partial collapse (Category 6) and total collapse (Category 7). In \naddition to damage to buildings, the scheme has information relevant to the recording of \ndamage to roads, pavements and land (Table 6). The recording of building damage using \nthe original 5 categories of the NCB scheme has been successfully applied to Ripon in \nGreat Britain (Griffin 1986, McNeary 2000) and to Calatayud in Spain (Gutierrez and \nCooper 2002). \n   \nDamage  \nCategory \nDescription of typical building damage Description of associated damage to \nroads and land \n0 Hairline cracking, widths to 0.1mm. Not visible from \noutside \nNot visible \n1 Fine cracks, generally restricted to internal wall \nfinishes; cracks rarely visible in external brickwork. \nTypical crack widths up to 1mm. Generally not \nvisible from outside. \nNot visible  \n2 Cracks not necessarily visible externally, some \nexternal repointing may be required. Doors and \nwindows may stick slightly, typical crack widths up \nto 5mm.

Classification of building damage for karst and other subsidence recording.  \n \nTo understand the karst of Great Britain and make a dataset that can be used the \nassessment of karst geohazards, the British Geological Survey has utilised this detailed \nkarst information to constrain the GeoSure dissolution dataset. \n \nThe GeoSure dissolution dataset \n \nOver the past decade, the British Geological Survey has invested a considerable amount \nof resources in the production of digital geological map data for the UK. Digital \ngeological maps are available for most of the country (except for a small part of Wales) at \na scale of 1:50,000 with all the country covered at the 1:250,000 and 1:625,000 scales; in \naddition, a significant amount of the country is now digitised at the 1:10,000 scale. All \nthese datasets include the bedrock and the 625,000, 50,000 and 10,000 scale datasets also \ninclude data for the superficial deposits. 1:50,000 and 1:10,000 scale digital data is also \navailable for artificial deposits and mass movement (mainly landslip) deposits.  The \ncoverage of digital data is listed on the Internet on the BGS Internet GIS search \nhttp:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/geoindex\/index.htm under the theme of \u201cMap products\u201d and the \ncategory of \u201cDigital geological maps 50,000\u201d which becomes active when zoomed in. \nOther information about the digital map datasets is accessed from the page: \nhttp:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/products\/digitalmaps\/digmapgb.html.   \n \nIn the digital geological map dataset, every polygon of digital geological data is attributed \nwith a two-part seed (LEX-ROCK) that gives its lithostratigraphy and its lithology. All \nthe lithostratigraphical (LEX) codes are listed on the Internet at \nhttp:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/lexicon\/lexicon_intro.html where they can be actively searched by \nname or code; many of the entries include extended information describing the units and \ntheir type localities. The lithological codes (ROCK) are also explained and listed on the \nInternet at http:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/bgsrcs\/home.html and can be searched by name or code \nat http:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/bgsrcs\/searchrcs.html. The 1:50,000 scale digital geological map \ndataset is now being developed in its third edition.  \n \nThe availability of digital map data linked to GIS software has opened new doors for the \ninterrogation and utilisation of geological data in the UK. The British Geological Survey \nhas produced new digital products for geological hazards, which it markets under the \nname of GeoSure (http:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/products\/geosure\/home.html). Several derived \ndatasets have been produced using a variety of algorithms to provide geohazard data for \nsoluble rocks (dissolution); landslides (slope instability); compressible ground; \ncollapsible rocks; shrink swell; and running sand. The methodology that underlies the \nconstruction of the dissolution dataset is described here.  \n \nIdentification of the evaporite and overlying collapse-affected formations \n \nThe first step in generating the soluble rock geohazard layer in the GeoSure dataset was \nto identify all the rocks in Great Britain, which contain a significant amount of evaporites \nand which are susceptible to dissolution and sinkhole development. Basically these are all \nthe formations that included a substantial amount of gypsum and salt at or near outcrop. \nThese were obtained from the digital 1:50,000 scale bedrock data, supplemented in a few \nplaces by 1:250,000 scale data. A search of all the lithological codes for evaporite rocks \nattached to the digital geological map polygons generated the first listing. Secondly a \nsimilar search was done of any formations and groups that were known to include \nevaporite rocks, but where they are a lesser constituent and thus not shown by the main \nlithological code. These selections were then displayed in the GIS (Figure 5, A) and \ncompared with the known distribution of karstic features from both the Department of the \nEnvironment Natural Cavities Database (Applied Geology Limited 1993) and the BGS \nkarst database (Figure 5, B).  \n \nIdentification of marginal areas \n \nFrom the superimposition of the map polygon information with the karst database \ninformation (Figure 5, B) and by incorporating previous local knowledge (Figure 5, C) it \nwas possible to pinpoint any interstratal karst. It was also possible to identify several \nformations that are not karstic themselves, but which are affected by karstic subsidence \nemanating from the underlying evaporite sequences. For example in the Ripon area, the \nPermian sequence from bottom to top comprises dolomite of the Cadeby Formation, \ngypsum and mudstone of the Edlington Formation, dolomite of the Brotherton Formation \nand gypsum and mudstone of the Roxby Formation. The sequence dips gently eastwards \n(Figure 2) and is capped by the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone Group. The Edlington and \nRoxby formations include significant thicknesses of gypsum (up to 40m and 10m thick \nrespectively), but the Brotherton Formation and the lower part of the Sherwood \nSandstone Group are also both affected by severe subsidence due to the dissolution of the \nunderlying gypsum. The whole of the Brotherton Formation can be affected by \nsubsidence emanating from gypsum dissolution, but only the western part (from a few \n100m to a Km or so) of the Sherwood Sandstone is affected. Although both the Cadeby \nand Brotherton Formations are dolomite, they are only slightly affected by karstification \nof this rock.  \n \nTo utilise this knowledge and to generate the GeoSure dissolution dataset for the Permian \nrocks in north-east England, it was necessary to combine the polygons for the Edlington \nFormation, the Brotherton Formation, the Roxby Formation and the part of the Sherwood \nSandstone Group that was affected. This generated a merged (Figure 5, D) polygon for all \nthe rock that was susceptible to subsidence, but it gave no indication of the severity of the \ncollapses that have occurred or may occur in that area.  \n \n \nFigure 5 (a-e) These figures show the way the national dissolution dataset is built  from \ndigital map data and the karst database information combined with local geological \nknowledge to construct the national zonation detailing the dissolution susceptibility for \ngypsum and salt \n Zonation of the karst-collapse prone areas \n \nUsing the detailed BGS karst database and the National Cavities Database (Applied \nGeology Ltd 1993) the severity of the dissolution hazards were assessed and related to \nthe local bedrock and superficial geology. This allowed the subsidence prone areas with \ngood information to be geologically characterised and zoned (Figure 5, D).  This \nassessment was then used to generate the rankings (Tables 7 and 8), which relate to the \ndegree to which future problems may locally occur. The extension of this ranking into \nareas where the database of subsidence events is patchy (due to variability in the \ninformation) is slightly subjective, but it does allow national geohazard coverage based \non the geological parameters to be generated. The five-fold subdivision is used and this is \nan internal British Geological Survey standard for assessing geological hazards; similar \nratings of severity have been applied to landslips, compressible ground, collapsible \nground, running sand and shrink-swell clays. For gypsum, five subdivisions were \ncompiled with Ripon in North Yorkshire taken as the worst-case scenario and areas \nwhere soluble rocks exist, but where there is little or no known subsidence has occurred \ntaken as the least severe case; for the gypsum sequences the zonation is: \nRanking Details \nA \u2013\nExtremely \nlow \nAreas where gypsum is present, but the thickness of deposits is known to be thin, where \nthe adjacent rocks are not aquifers and there is no recorded subsidence. Mainly the \nTriassic Mercia Mudstone Group where fibrous gypsum has been recorded. \nB \u2013 \nVery low \nAreas where gypsum is present in substantial thicknesses, but where the adjacent rocks are \nnot aquifers and where there is no recorded subsidence. Mainly the Triassic Mercia \nMudstone Group where thick gypsum is present. \nC \u2013 \nLow \nAreas where gypsum is present in substantial thicknesses, where the adjacent rocks may or \nmay not be aquifers, but where there is no recorded subsidence. Mainly the Triassic \nMercia Mudstone Group where thick gypsum is present and some karstification has \noccurred. Similarly, the majority of the Permian gypsum in the Vale of Eden and some of \nthe Permian gypsum of eastern England are also included.  \nD \u2013 \nModerate \nAreas where gypsum is present in substantial thicknesses, where the adjacent rocks are \naquifers and where there is some recorded subsidence. Mainly the Permian gypsum of \neastern England, including areas peripheral to Ripon, Darlington, Tadcaster, Church \nFenton etc. \nE \u2013 \nHigh \nAreas where gypsum is present in substantial thicknesses, where the adjacent rocks are \naquifers, where buried valleys cut through the sequence and where there are numerous \nrecords of ongoing subsidence. Mainly the Permian gypsum of eastern England including \nsouth of Darlington, Ripon, and near Brotherton. \nTable 7, parameters used to define the hazard ranking for gypsum dissolution prone \nareas. \n The geological parameters for the salt sequences are different, but generate the same \ncategories with subsidence geohazards rankings comparable to those used for the gypsum \nsequences:  \n \nRanking Details \nA \u2013\nExtremely \nlow \nAreas where salt is present, but the thickness of deposits is known to be thin and covered \nwith impervious material \nB \u2013  \nVery low \nAreas where salt is present in substantial thicknesses, but where the deposits are covered \nwith impervious material. \nC \u2013 \nLow \nAreas where salt is present in substantial thicknesses and present at rockhead (wet \nrockhead).  \nD \u2013 \nModerate \nAreas where salt is present in substantial thicknesses, present at rockhead (wet rockhead) \nand where salt springs are present in the area. \nE\u2013  \nHigh \nAreas where salt is present in substantial thicknesses, present at rockhead (wet rockhead) \nand where wild brining or nearby mining has occurred, salt springs are present and there is \nsome recorded subsidence in the vicinity; mainly the Triassic salt of Cheshire and \nWorcestershire. \nTable 8, parameters used to define the hazard ranking for salt dissolution prone areas. \n \nAlthough the datasets have been subdivided into five categories, the extremely low (A) \nand very low categories (B) are not generally significant for most uses. Consequently, for \ncommercial and public use, only the three higher ratings of Low, Moderate and High (C, \nD and E) are used. http:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/products\/geosure\/pdf\/soluble.pdf . These are the \nsubdivisions that are also used on the interactive web GIS which explains these hazards \nand which can be accessed through http:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/britainbeneath\/guide.html.  \n \nUses of the datasets \n \nInsurance \n \nThe national dissolution dataset is available commercially and has found uses in the \ninsurance industry. Insurance companies have used it to define problematical areas where \nthey wish to limit their exposure to risk or charge a slightly increase premium to reflect \nthe increased claims that would occur in such areas. The availability of the GeoSure \ndatasets enables the insurance industry to correlate their claims history with the likely \ngeological causes. \n \nHouse purchase \n \nFor the house buyer, the recent Government initiative to speed house sales transactions \ncalled for a \u201cHomebuyers information pack\u201d which was to include information derived \nfrom this dataset, however, the scheme has been cancelled. Third-party information \nproviders and the British Geological Survey utilise the information and supply it to the \npublic as part of their environmental information searches. The presence of a moderate or \nhigh dissolution rating (class E or D) does not mean that any particular property will \ncollapse, but it acts as a warning that the area is susceptible to dissolution and may be \nprone to subsidence. The recommendation for house buyers in such areas is that a full \nstructural survey is undertaken and that the surrounding properties and infrastructure are \nalso examined for damage. If some evidence of subsidence is found in the immediate or \nsurrounding area, further investigation is recommended.  \n \nUrban and national planning and construction \n \nLocal and National Government have a responsibility to protect the public from \nforeseeable hazards. Development on unstable ground is covered by the Planning Policy \nGuidance PPG 14 and its Annex 2 (Department of the Environment 1990, Department of \nTransport, Local Government and the Regions 2002). Local Government through their \nLocal Development Plans have a responsibility to consider unstable ground in their local \nareas. In some places, such as Ripon, they have had specific local advice (Thompson et al \n1996, Paukstys et al 1997), which is now included in local planning policy, but for most \nof the country this has not been done. The national dissolution dataset and the detailed \nkarst database provide the baseline information from which Local Government can obtain \nan assessment of the local stability of their area. \n \nLinear route assessments \u2013 roads, pipelines, railways \n \nLinear structures such as railways, roads and large airfields are very susceptible to \nsubsidence damage; even small amounts of settlement can be disastrous for fast moving \nrail traffic. Oil and gas pipelines are susceptible to subsidence movements, which can \ncause them to be run at lower and less economical pressures (Hucka et al 1986). The \nGeoSure dataset and the karst dataset allow the rapid assessment of new routes and the \nlikely stability and risk to existing structures to be determined (Gibson et al 2005).  \n \nWater abstraction and ingress \n \nThe national karst dissolution dataset helps to define areas in gypsum karst where there is \nstrong hydrogeological connectivity from the surface to the subsurface gypsum karst. \nThis connectivity largely takes place down breccia pipes, collapsed areas and the bottoms \nof dolines. The connectivity through the sequence is important for aquifer modelling and \naquifer protection. The karstic nature of the sequence and the active dissolution of \ngypsum explain why the Sherwood Sandstone, which is usually a very good aquifer, can \ncontain significant amounts of sulphate-rich water at its western limit where it directly \noverlies mudstones that in turn overlie gypsum. Similarly, the dolomites of the Cadeby \nFormation may contain sulphate-rich water derived from the overlying gypsum in the \nEdlington Formation. The mudstones in the sequence do not act as an effective aquitard \nbecause they are perforated by breccia pipes caused by gypsum dissolution and this fact \nmust be considered when modelling the hydrogeology of the area. Areas of salt karst are \nnot affected in the same way since the presence of brines makes them unattractive as \naquifers. Water ingress also affects salt karst less as the salt at wet rock head may be \nprotected in places by a layer of dense brine. \n \nWaste disposal sites \n \nSinkholes in some places look like disused quarries and have in the past been used as \nwaste disposal sites; east of Ripon, five holes were filled with domestic rubbish during \nthe 1960\u2019s or early 70\u2019s. Because there is such good hydrogeological connectivity \nthrough the sinkholes and into the underlying breccia pipes to the aquifer, sinkhole areas \nshould be avoided for waste disposal. Any leachate from these types of landfill can find \nits way very rapidly to the springs that drain the karstic system. Where landfill activities \ndo have to take place consideration should be given to ascertaining the stability of the \nground and to the provision of hydrological barriers and membranes. The karst database \nand the national dissolution dataset provide some background information for studies \nlooking into the provision of waste disposal areas.  \n \nSite specific enquiries and automated enquiries \n \nBoth the site specific information contained in the karst database, and the national \nGeoSure dissolution dataset can be tailored to allow automated reporting for geological \nenquiries and studies. The British Geological Survey GeoReports  \nhttp:\/\/shop.bgs.ac.uk\/georeports\/ utilise the GeoSure dissolution dataset to help provide \nbackground information for the BGS enquiry system, but, except for the basic Ground \nStability Reports, the final interpretation and reporting is currently done manually even \nthough many parts of the reports are automated. It is possible to subdivide the national \ndissolution dataset even further based on local geology and subsidence history. \nParagraphs of locally specific text could then be attached to each polygon in the database. \nThese paragraphs of information could then be automatically recalled to populate part of \nthe local GeoReport. Further detail could also be added from the detailed karst database \nwith information such as the distance from a sinkhole and the subsidence history of the \nsinkhole included. The generation of this type of automated reporting is the start of \nbuilding an expert system for geological reporting.  \n \nConclusions \n \nThe combination of digital map information and detailed karst database information has \nenabled the construction of a national dataset for the susceptibility of evaporite rocks \n(gypsum and salt) to dissolution problems. This dataset allied with the detailed karst \ndataset is a powerful tool for planning and hazard avoidance with the potential for \nautomated geological reporting of the problems.   \n \nAcknowledgements.
