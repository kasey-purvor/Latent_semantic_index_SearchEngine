Set in London against the backdrop of the Queen\u2019s Silver Jubilee celebrations, the film explores racism and homophobia in Britain in the late 1970s, epitomised by the murder of a gay black man at the start of the film and a series of hostile encounters between soul boys and skinheads.

Born in Cambridge in 1962, she spent most of her childhood living in a Barnardo\u2019s orphanage in Essex after being passed into care by her single mother who had recently moved to Britain from Sierra Leone. After a disrupted youth and troubled adolescence, she began writing whilst studying Politics and Philosophy at the University of Leeds in the early 1980s. Motivated by the horror of the murders committed by Peter Sutcliffe (\u2018the Yorkshire Ripper\u2019), she became a founding editor of the feminist student magazine Jezebel. A political activist, she was a member of Women Against Violence Against Women and supported the Miners\u2019 Strike of 1984-5. Before completing her degree she moved to London to become a journalist, a role that offered an opportunity to pursue her interest in world affairs. She reported on events such as the Broadwater Farm Riot of 1985, the Nicaraguan Civil War, and the struggles against apartheid in South Africa. As an international correspondent, she also covered issues such as Aboriginal Land Rights and the deaths of black people held in custody in Australia. As well as working as a feature writer for the black national paper The Voice, she was a staff reporter for the national lesbian and gay Pink Paper, and co-editor of \nFeminist Arts News (1992-1997). She has also written for publications such as the \nGuardian, the Morning Star, and Capital Gay.   However, Mason-John gave up journalism on the grounds that \u2018it was impossible to tell true stories, the media didn\u2019t want the truth, and it was these stories I wanted to tell\u2019.1 Seeking ways to tell stories more truthfully, she studied clowning and took a course at the Desmond Jones School of Mime and Physical Theatre, where she \u2018reclaimed the art of play...reliving some lost childhood years\u2019.2 She started writing plays and through drama found liberation:  \u2018I realised I could say anything I wanted in theatre, without it being censored before my audience got to see it\u2019.3 Since she took up creative writing she has devoted herself to telling untold stories, particularly ones that subvert the myths that uphold the dominant ideologies of race, sexuality, gender, and nation. In a theatrical context, she is best known for her one-woman shows. Sweep It Under the \n2 \n \nCarpet was first performed in 1997 but revised as Brown Girl in the Ring in 1998 and republished in Deirdre Osborne\u2019s Hidden Gems (2008), a collection of six experimental plays by black British writers.4 Sin Dykes was first performed in 1998 and is published in Brown Girl in the Ring: Plays, Poems and Prose.5 Winner of the Mind Book of the Year Award, Mason-John\u2019s debut novel Borrowed Body (2005), republished as The Banana \nKid (2008), bought critical acclaim in the realm of fiction.6  She has won several other prestigious prizes and awards: she was named one of Britain's Black Gay Icons in 1997, received a Windrush Achievement Award in 2000 for her artistic contribution to the Black and Asian communities, and was granted an honorary doctorate from the University of East London in 2007.7  Like Black Art and Culture on the Mainland of Europe (1992), a book that Mason-John edited for the Arts Council of England, Brown Girl in the Ring challenges the disavowal of racial mixing and intermingling in European history.  Inspired by stories she heard in Australia about photographs of white families that featured holes where the heads of aboriginal relatives had been cut out, and her discovery that Queen Sophia Charlotte, wife of King George III and great, great grandmother of Queen Victoria, had African ancestry, this one-woman show focuses on Regina, a black \u2018throwback\u2019 born to white parents due to polygenic inheritance (p. 304).8 The play traces the struggle for recognition and acceptance of this \u2018aristobrat\u2019 and \u2018odd girl out\u2019 (p. 308). Regina\u2019s parents are shocked and shamed by their daughter\u2019s skin colour - \u2018My poor Mamama never spoke again\u2019 and \u2018Dadada castrated himself\u2019 (p. 306 ) \u2013 and she is \u2018packed off to relatives \u2013 the Bollys of Ascot\u2019 (p. 307), where , as the play\u2019s refrain  - \u2018Sweep it under the carpet\u2019  - makes clear, she is expunged from personal and public record. Exclusion is represented visually by the picture of a \u2018white royal-looking family\u2019 that is projected onto the stage since \u2018a head of someone is missing\u2019 (p. 293).  As the royal family is coterminous with the nation, the play highlights the construction of the myth that Britain is a racially and ethnically homogenous place, one endorsed by the racist chant \u2018there ain\u2019t no black in the Union Jack\u2019 that Paul Gilroy takes as the title for his book on the relationship between race and nation.9 Verifying Mason-John\u2019s assertion that \u2018I could never have got away with telling this story as a journalist\u2019,10 several reviewers writing for national newspapers questioned that Queen Victoria was descended from a mixed-race lineage. However, The Sunday Times, eventually confirmed that the play was \n3 \n based on fact.11\n \n Mason-John\u2019s unpublished play You Get Me (first produced in 2006) continues her exploration of hostile reactions to an inter-racial family, this time in a contemporary setting.  \nWhereas Brown Girl in the Ring concerns the connectedness of black and white subjects in a familial and national context, Sin Dykes explores sexual relationships between black and white women. Having co-authored with Ann Khambattta the first book to document the lives of black and Asian lesbians in Britain, Lesbians Talk: Making Black Waves (1993), which was followed by an edited collection of essays, Talking Black: Lesbians of African and Asian Descent \nSpeak Out (1994), in this play Mason-John continues to challenge the myth that homosexuality is a white phenomenon by helping \u2018to make black lesbians visible\u2019.12 As the title indicates, Sin Dykes affirms identities and desires previously regarded as sinful, shameful or taboo. In contrast to Ann Bannon\u2019s pre-Stonewall classic lesbian novel Odd Girl Out (1957), which focuses on Laura Landon, a shy college student whose wary attraction to women leaves her isolated and at odds with society, Mason-John\u2019s \u2018odd girls\u2019 are out and proud. Further, the play celebrates difference: as the title punningly suggests, the protagonists \u2013 who mostly inhabit a London club - are \u2018scene\u2019, not herd. The play also dramatises the tensions that developed between black lesbian feminist and queer politics in the 1990s. The notes that accompany the text explain:  \u2018dykes are out of the closet. Black dykes openly do SM, dykes openly sleep with gay men. There is dialogue, debate, and outrage, but nobody is listening any more\u2019 (p.  41). In response to this situation, Mason-John\u2019s protagonists demand to be both seen and heard. Resisting what she calls \u2018the black lesbian thought police\u2019,13 which condemned inter-racial relationships as \u2018sleeping with the enemy\u2019, and the then prevalent lesbian view that penetrative sex is patriarchal, Mason-John explores the politics of pleasure through her representation of  same-sex desire between black and white women, the use of dildos, and s\/m sex. Like Patience Agbabi\u2019s poetry collection Transformatrix (2000), the play moves away from an earlier period in which, as Trudy notes, \u2018dykes seemed too frightened to talk about sex\u2019 and helped to establish a playful, sex-positive lesbian culture, asking complex questions about power without providing easy answers(p. 80). Sin Dykes was \n4 \n first performed at the Oval House Theatre in London, where it was a box-office sell-out, and has since been staged regularly throughout the world.   Where Sin Dykes addresses relationships between black and white women, The \nBanana Kid explores the relationship between \u2018black\u2019 and \u2018white\u2019 selves embodied by one girl, Pauline Charles, a black child brought up by white carers in a series of middle-class homes. The novel draws on Mason-John\u2019s own experience of growing up in a Barnardo\u2019s orphanage and, through its representation of transracial care, portrays an important aspect of black British history, one that - Mason-John notes - is \u2018missing from the predominant black British culture\u2019.14\n \n A fictionalised memoir, in The Banana Kid Mason-John transforms autobiography into art through the power of the imagination, endowing her story with a significance that exceeds the personal. Fiction also provides a means of portraying events too painful to relate directly.  \nThe novel offers a compelling account of the racism endured by a black child living in a predominantly white British society in the 1970s, its title simultaneously indicative of Pauline\u2019s status as a \u2018Barnardo\u2019s kid\u2019 and an allusion to the racist comparison of black people to monkeys (p. 223). Stigmatised by racial difference in the children\u2019s home, Pauline is punished for being too English after being sent to live with her African mother, Wunmi, in London. Likewise, at her new inner city school, she is mocked by other black girls for \u2018speaking like the Queen\u2019 (p. 128), and ostracised for being \u2018a Bounty, a coconut...White inside, Black outside\u2019 (p. 125). Thus, although not mixed race, Pauline has to learn to negotiate a bi-cultural identity. This is a theme that Mason-John pursues in her forthcoming second novel I am Memoried. The Banana Kid, which has been described as \u2018the British Color Purple\u2019,15\n \n positioning Mason-John alongside the celebrated African American writer Alice Walker, is currently being adapted for the screen. \nAs Brown Girl in the Ring, Sin Dykes and The Banana Kid suggest, identity is a principal theme in Mason-John\u2019s work which persistently examines the interconnectedness of race, ethnicity, gender and nationhood from a woman-centred perspective that privileges female experience. Identity is presented as constructed and performative. As Gabriele Griffin notes, in Brown Girl in the Ring, the jigsaw pieces that \n5 \n scatter the stage, and the jigsaw throne symbolise both the construction and fragmentation of Regina\u2019s self.16\nIf Brown Girl in the Ring reveals the elision of \u2018blackness\u2019 required to construct the nation as \u2018white\u2019, Sin Dykes highlights that \u2018black\u2019 is, as Stuart Hall insists, \u2018essentially a politically and culturally constructed category, which cannot be grounded in a set of fixed transcultural or transcendental racial categories and which therefore has no guarantee in Nature\u2019.\n The suggestion that the jigsaw functions as a metaphor for identity is endorsed by the moment when Regina looks at one piece \u2018as if it were a mirror\u2019 (p. 307). The play traces Regina\u2019s attempt to win acceptance as a member of the English aristocracy by performing a hegemonic identity. Whereas initially she requests \u2018caviar...and rice and peas\u2019 (p. 297), foods that reflect her dual cultural heritage, she later asserts her preference for Handel\u2019s Messiah over \u2018reggae music\u2019 (p. 305). Also, when she takes her place on the thrown, declaring herself \u2018Queen of England\u2019, Beethoven\u2019s F\u00fcr \nElise \u2018blasts out\u2019 (p. 315), replacing the sound of \u2018Brown Girl in the Ring\u2019, the Boney M tune that she sings intermittently throughout the show. \n17 Griffin proposes that Sin Dykes repudiates essentialist and monolithic notions of \u2018the black woman\u2019 through its presentation of a range of different identities:18 Trudy, the central character, is \u2018a Brixton babe\u2019 with a \u2018non-specific black British accent\u2019; Kat is \u2018an afrekeke dyke\u2019 who speaks with \u2018a Jamaican accent\u2019; and Clio is an \u2018Essex girl\u2019 with a \u2018Cockney\u2019 accent (p. 42). Kat highlights the self-conscious adoption of an Afrocentric identity.  Kat is an \u2018African-Caribbean\u2019 woman who adopts patois to communicate her identification as an \u2018African sistah\u2019 (p. 48). However, she slips into London slang when angry - \u2018Are you off your box or what?\u2019 (p. 56).19 In addition, when her Afrocentricism is compromised by contradictions in her political ideology (Kat is critical of Trudy for sleeping with white women and condemns SM sex but it transpires that she has secretly had sex with Gill, a \u2018self-defined SM dyke\u2019 (p. 55), and uses handcuffs in her \u2018play\u2019 with another white woman, BD), Trudy tells her to \u2018Cut the patois\u2019 (p. 81). Further, Gill \u2013 a white woman - speaks patois just as well as Kat. When she warns Trudy that \u2018Kat will cuss your clart\u2019 (p. 72), Trudy responds, \u2018Cha so you tink your black now?\u2019 (p. 72).20 Indeed, Sin Dykes invokes an essentialist conception of race and ethnicity in order to challenge it. Kat\u2019s assertion that \u2018Black women don\u2019t \/ do SM\u2019 because it is \u2018not in our genes\u2019 (p. 79) is subverted by her own analysis of the historical and political reasons why she finds SM problematic: chains and handcuffs offer an \n6 \n uncomfortable reminder of slavery and a racist criminal justice system that has put three of her brothers \u2018behind bars\u2019 and restrained a fourth in a psychiatric unit (p. 59).  \n Further illustrating a non-essentialist conception of race, ethnicity and culture, in \nThe Banana Kid, Pauline learns what Claire E. Alexander calls \u2018the art of being black\u2019 , through which identity is \u2018created and re-created as part of an ongoing and dynamic process\u2019.21 At her inner city school, Pauline drops her \u2018posh voice\u2019 (p. 132) and later learns \u2018pidgin English\u2019 from her half-sister Shola who arrives from Nigeria to live with Pauline and her mother (p. 160). Shola also puts Pauline\u2019s hair into \u2018cane row, inside-out corn row and china bumps\u2019 (p. 163) instead of \u2018bunches\u2019 (p. 106). After being taken from Wunmi and placed in another home, Pauline meets Alexis, who teaches her how to swap  \u2018t\u2019s for d\u2019s\u2019 and say \u2018deres, dese, dat and dem\u2019 (p. 182), to suck her teeth, to wear a headscarf, and dance to soul and reggae. At grammar school, Pauline performs her \u2018black\u2019 identity for a white audience by speaking patois with Sadie, the only other black girl present, and mimics the pose of Jamaican \u2018rude boys\u2019, simultaneously highlighting the performativity of race and gender: \u2018We show off and step into our starring roles most lunchtimes\u2019 (p. 204). However, while she embraces a \u2018black\u2019 self, Pauline is unable to deny the double vision that Susheila Nasta describes as the product of her own position as the daughter of an Indian father and English mother.22 Thus the novel questions the idea of an authentic form of blackness, one based on the exclusion of whiteness and Englishness, echoing Jayne O. Ifekwunigwe\u2019s call for a model of coming to terms with blackness that does not require a mixed-raced or transracially-raised subject to sever ties with her white, English roots.23 In the \u2018Hole\u2019 (p. 220), a remand centre where Pauline is sent to await her sentence for shoplifting, one inmate remarks that she is whiter than her white friend Sherry: \u2018You\u2019re so fucking posh and Miss Prim-and-Proper. You should be white and her black\u2019 (p. 226). Simultaneously both \u2018black\u2019 and \u2018white\u2019, Pauline epitomises \u2018the crisscrossed circuitry of cross-identification\u2019 that Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz associates with queers of color, and her dual identity makes her a cultural \u2018terrorist\u2019 in the sense that she performs \u2018the nation\u2019s internal terrors around race\u2019, particularly fears about the transgression of boundaries.24\n \n In this sense, Mason-John transforms her \u2018banana kid\u2019 from monkey into guerrilla. \n7 \n An interrogation of the constructedness of ethnic and racial identity is accompanied by a questioning of the essentialist norms of gender. Brown Girl in the Ring was inspired by a workshop conducted by Lois Weaver, co-founder of the lesbian feminist theatre company Split Britches, renowned for producing satirical, gender-bending shows, and employs exaggeration to create a drag aesthetic that exposes the artificiality of femininity.25 Thus, although the sexuality of the protagonist remains unspecified, the play can be termed \u2018queer\u2019 in its deployment of what Mu\u00f1oz terms an \u2018excess effect\u2019 that works to destabilise the world of \u2018pasty normals\u2019.26 Adopting the role of ballet dancer, the epitome of feminine grace, Regina appears on stage wearing a \u2018ballet dress with several petticoats underneath and bloomers\u2019, ballet shoes, a white courtier\u2019s wig and \u2018jewels fit for a queen\u2019 (p. 293). She speaks in an \u2018exaggerated\u2019 upperclass English accent (p. 297). The wig that, like her accent, denotes Regina\u2019s class status in the context of aristocratic society also makes her look like a contemporary drag queen, and the performativity of gender is stressed by her \u2018highly stylised\u2019 (p. 297) movements and the adoption of various poses, which echo the contemporary fashion for \u2018voguing\u2019 in queer culture, a key feature of the African American and Latino drag balls chronicled in Jennie Livingston\u2019s documentary Paris is Burning (1990). After taking the part of Regina, Mason-John became known as \u2018Queenie\u2019, a persona she has embraced as a performer and an educator in order to differentiate her journalism from her work in other spheres, but one that also challenges the legacy of colonialism, which forces many black people \u2018to live in a class lower than our real one\u2019.27 Mason-John\u2019s \u2018aristocratic self\u2019 is likewise reflected in her playful description of her role as resident presenter of the pilot television show South Thames Live: \u2018I\u2019m Lady of the manor!\u201928  \nSin Dykes unsettles the binary norms of gender, sex and sexuality. The Diva bar, the backdrop of much of the action of the play, is populated by several \u2018funeral and diesel dykes\u2019 (p. 48), and Butch characters like BD, who is \u2013 as her name indicates - \u2018a bull dyke lesbian\u2019, and Trace, who is \u2018laddish\u2019 (p. 42), epitomise what Judith Halberstam terms \u2018lesbian counterproductions of female masculinity\u2019 that contest the \u2018privileged reservation of masculinity for men\u2019.29 As Kat\u2019s account of \u2018genderbending courses\u2019 suggests, masculinity is not a natural expression of maleness but a performance that can be adopted by women or men:  \u2018They\u2019ll teach you how to strap your breasts down, don a tash, and how to bulge in the right places\u2019 (p. 54).Through her focus on black butches, \n8 \n Mason-John echoes Halberstam\u2019s point that masculinity, typically rendered invisible through a process of reification, becomes legible \u2018where and when it leaves the white male middle-class body\u2019.30 The play\u2019s subversion of gender boundaries is extended by the man that Trudy mistakes for a woman, an error which elicits Gill\u2019s assertion that \u2018the best looking dykes are gay boys\u2019 (p. 50). While the representation of black women in butch roles undercuts heteropatriarchal gendered binary oppositions, the portrayal of femme black lesbians also challenges the racial stereotype of black women as sexually assertive. As Mason John explains, \u2018During my twenties, I felt an unspoken pressure to be butch in bed from white women, as if we, black women, had to be sexually dominant\u2019.31\nThe fluidity and plurality of gendered subjectivities portrayed in Sin Dykes reflects the mobility of Mason-John\u2019s own gendered sense of self: once \u2018a go-go dancer, clad in top hat, tails and a strap-on dildo\u2019,\n Further, Sin Dykes presents lesbian butch\/femme identities as mutable rather than mutually exclusive. Gill, for example, is \u2018butch\/femme on the streets, butch between the sheets\u2019 and Trudy, although a \u2018femme\u2019 (p. 42), dons a dildo. Likewise, when BD removes her trousers, she reveals \u2018sexy suspenders\u2019 (p. 60).  \n32 she also appears in Del LaGrace Volcano and Ulrika Dahl\u2019s Femmes of Power: Exploding Queer Femininities (2008). As she comments,   \u2018Queer culture had a huge impact on me when I realised I could be a femme one day and something else the next\u2019.33 An interest in non-normative genders is further marked by her role in the 1990s as Director of the Pride Arts Festival and Artistic Director of London\u2019s Mardi Gras, the UK\u2019s biggest celebration of lesbian and gay lives, and as host \u2013 as Queenie \u2013 of Britain\u2019s first Drag King competition at London\u2019s National Film Theatre in 1995, a cheeky response to \u2018lesbian chic\u2019, which, Mason-John avers, compels women \u2018to conform to an image that is ultimately acceptable and non-threatening to men\u2019.34\nSubverting the heteropatriarchal view that lesbians are pseudo-men, Sin Dykes, also illustrates that the phallus signifies might rather than maleness. Trudy borrows her dildo from Gill, and Clio and Trace both wear a dildo under their clothes, a practice known as \u2018packing\u2019 (p. 53). As she teaches Trudy how to wear a dildo, Gill tells her, \u2018Go \n Likewise, Britain\u2019s first national \u2018Alternative Lesbian Beauty Contest\u2019, organised and hosted by Queenie in 1998, celebrates the diversity of women\u2019s queer identities and challenges the narrowness of dominant definitions of \u2018beauty\u2019 through the categories \u2018butch\u2019, \u2018femme\u2019, \u2018drag king\u2019, \u2018pierced and tattooed, \u2018mature\u2019 and \u2018women of colour\u2019.  \n9 \n on, move your hips a bit. Get comfortable, get familiar. Get in touch with its power\u2019 (p. 76). Indeed, as Judith Butler has shown, the lesbian phallus constitutes not an imitation of maleness but a subversion of sexual difference. In Bodies That matter (1993), Butler draws on Freud\u2019s notion of the imaginary contours of the bodily ego, and Lacan\u2019s proposition that the morphology of the body is a \u2018psychically invested projection, an idealization or fiction\u2019, to argue that the phallus is \u2018an imaginary effect\u2019 and a \u2018transferable and plastic property\u2019.35 Because morphologies are projected, variable projections and modes of delineating and \u2018theatricalising\u2019 body surfaces are possible, such that body surfaces or bodily egos may become sites of transfer for properties that no longer properly belong to any anatomy.36 Exemplifying Butler\u2019s theory, the dildos worn by Mason-John\u2019s female characters demonstrate that identifications that cross gender boundaries \u2018reinstitute sexed bodies in variable ways\u2019 and \u2018reconfigure the mapping of sexual difference itself\u2019.37\n \n The lesbian phallus subverts the binary categories of both sex and sexuality. As Kat explains to Trudy, \u2018One thing you\u2019ve got to understand about some of these 1990s white girls is that they say it\u2019s alright to screw a man and call yourself a dyke. It\u2019s the phase at the moment, packing a dildo down their Calvin Klein\u2019s, and picking up cute looking gay men. It\u2019s all the rage. They call it queer\u2019 (p. 53).  \nThe Banana Kid likewise subverts binary categories of gender.  In her essay, \u2018My Awakening to Lesbianism\u2019, Mason-John highlights the forceful imposition of gender norms when she reveals that her biological mother beat her for expressing a desire to be a boy as well as for not being African.38\n \n Likewise, in The Banana Kid, Aunty Morag is disconcerted by Pauline\u2019s desire to play outside and get her clothes dirty. Worrying that she is \u2018different from the other girls\u2019 (p. 17), she urges Pauline to \u2018start playing with dolls in the nursery\u2019 (p. 22). However, Pauline subverts the conventional categories of gender. A tomboy who wears her hair \u2018cropped like a boy\u2019 (p. 106), she rejects the trappings of conventional femininity - \u2018no earrings\u2019 (p.106) \u2013 wants to be \u2018an aeroplane pilot\u2019 (p. 105), and is attracted to other tomboys, like Theresa, who prefers to be called \u2018Terry\u2019 (p. 42).  \nWhile Mason-John forms part of what R. Victoria Arana sees as a new (post-1996) wave of black British writers who reinvent and redefine what it means to be British, she is specifically preoccupied with the ideology of Englishness.39 Brown Girl in \n10 \n \nthe Ring challenges the association of Englishness with whiteness when Regina asserts, \u2018I am as English as Her Majesty\u2019 (p. 297).  In The Banana Kid, Pauline initially internalises dominant definitions of Englishness that demand that she denies her blackness (like Regina in Brown Girl). She tries to scrub off her black skin, chalks and flours herself, and even douses herself in bleach. Later, to embrace her blackness, she denies her Englishness. When she learns that \u2018Inglis\u2019 is regarded as a derogatory term in the black community (p. 129), she starts \u2018talking Jamaica\u2019 (p. 205).  However, ultimately, Pauline accepts that she is both black and British. The novel further debunks the myth of national and ethnic purity through Pauline\u2019s \u2018English\u2019 family, which includes Uncle Boris, a German Jew, and Aunty Morag, whose name suggests she is a Scot.  Moreover, the Barnardo\u2019s home, \u2018where most of us aren\u2019t sure where we really come from\u2019 (p. 131), serves as a microcosm of England, a culturally hybrid and genetically diverse nation shaped by Roman, Saxon, and Norman influences. Mason-John continues to reflect on Englishness in her blog, where she notes that even the rose, often regarded as the epitome of Englishness, comes from Persia.40  Home and family are other central preoccupations. The Banana Kid follows a number of classic black and lesbian texts such as Toni Morrison\u2019s The Bluest Eye (1970), Alice Walker\u2019s The Color Purple (1982), Dorothy Allison\u2019s Bastard out of Carolina (1992), and Sapphire\u2019s Push (1996), recently filmed as Precious (2009), in questioning the dominant ideal of home as a place of safety and security for girls. In Mason-John\u2019s work, home is frequently the site of trauma, and the impact of acute psychological distress is a persistent concern. Her first show, Body Politics (produced in 1991), explores the relationship between sexual abuse, rape and eating disorders.41 Brown Girl \nin the Ring delineates the psychological damage caused by the negative, stereotypical views of blackness internalised by Regina:  \u2018I look like the fly\/ In the milk, milk, milk\u2019 (p. 300), \u2018I look like the alien \/ From Mars Mars Mars\u2019; \u2018I look like the golly \/ On the jam jar jar jar\u2019 (p. 309); \u2018I look like the mould \/ In the cheese cheese cheese\u2019 (p. 310). Repetition creates the effect of a stammer, a common symptom of trauma. Psychic distress is also indicated by Regina\u2019s \u2018hysterical laughter\u2019 (p. 306) and the invention of an imaginary friend, \u2018Lizard\u2019. However, rather than endorsing the views espoused by Regina\u2019s psychiatrist, who pathologizes blackness by suggesting that \u2018negroes\u2019 are \u2018manic\u2019, stupid \n11 \n and \u2018aggressive\u2019 (pp. 313-4), Brown Girl in the Ring highlights the harm caused by dominant ideologies of race.   For Pauline in The Banana Kid, home is the location where she is bullied, sexually abused, and beaten. She creates a series of imaginary friends - Sparky, Angel, and Snake - who express her distress by forcing her to behave in disruptive ways and reflect her fractured sense of self.  Seeking to escape her stigmatised black body, the sexual abuse she is subjected to by other children in the home, and the physical violence she suffers at the hands of her sadistic, mentally unstable mother, Pauline has out-of-body experiences. Like her imaginary friends, who offer the support she needs to survive an intensely painful situation, splitting and dissociation are psychological strategies that she develops to cope with trauma, also suggested by her tendency to sleepwalk. Related from Pauline\u2019s perspective, the novel captures a child\u2019s consciousness through the use of a first person narrative. By telling the story in the present tense, Mason-John conveys the way that children tend to live in the moment, although being in the present is also a state of consciousness that can be achieved through meditation, a practice that Mason-John links to healing in her self-help book Detox your Heart (2005).42\n \n The use of the present tense thus simultaneously creates a sense of immediacy that makes it impossible for readers not to empathise with Pauline\u2019s plight and hopefully signals her potential for healing. \nChallenging the conservative ideal of the nuclear unit, Mason-John also refashions family. In Sin Dykes, for example, a queer community offers an alternative model of kinship, an extended family founded on community rather than biology. Similarly, The Banana Kid queers the traditional family: in the Barnardo\u2019s home, Pauline has three non-biological house parents, including two maternal figures: Aunty Claire, her husband, Uncle Boris, and Aunty Morag, the cook.  Although Mason-John redefines the conventional structures of kinship and community, her Christmas show, The \nAdventures of Snow Black and Rose Red (first produced 2001-2), which was written for a family audience, suggests that family is a concept she continues to cherish.  Nonetheless, a sense of homelessness haunts Mason-John\u2019s queer, black, female protagonists. The Banana Kid explores the painful impact of deracination and \n12 \n transracial care - the trauma of growing up with what Lemn Sissay (another trans-racially raised black British writer) punningly calls \u2018No next of skin\u2019 in his poem \u2018Before We Get  Into This\u2019.43 Dislocated from both her mother\u2019s country and her biological family, Pauline experiences an acute sense of loss, and her metaphorical homelessness is reflected in and compacted by her literal homelessness when she runs away to live on the streets. Avtar Brah proposes that diasporic narratives often articulate what she terms \u2018homing desires\u2019,44 the struggle to locate a site of belonging. Likewise, Ann-Marie Fortier suggests that queer subjects experience exile and estrangement which locates them outside the confines of home in its various forms (family, nation).45 A black girl brought up in care who begins to explore her sexuality at the end of the novel when she falls in love with a female prison guard, Pauline epitomises the metaphorical homelessness of the queer diasporic subject.  However, The Banana Kid points to the positive potential of unbelonging and endorses both Fortier\u2019s assertion that movement can be the basis of new forms of identity and James Proctor\u2019s contention that for the diasporic subject \u2018dwelling constitutes a kind of para-site, within travel\u2019.46\n \n Reflecting this, the novel ends on an uplifting note as Pauline leaves prison and begins a journey to an unspecified destination that is full of possibility:  \u2018My heart beats fast as I watch the green pastures whiz by\u2019 (p. 244).  \nWhile Mason-John\u2019s work explores what it means to be \u2018black, woman, and lesbian in Britain\u2019,47 she protests \u2018the notion that black writers can only write for and about black characters\u2019.48 Being a journalist not only taught her to write concisely, she says, but also enabled her \u2018to write about everything\u2019.49 A refusal to be confined \u2013 to be a brown girl ringed - has shaped her relationship to form as well as content, and her work epitomises the \u2018unsettling, recombination, hybridisation and \u201ccut-and-mix\u201d\u2019 that defines a diaspora aesthetic.50 She has worked in various media and written in diverse forms, often across literary genres. She has presented her work on both page and stage, relishing the opportunity to exploit sight and sound. She has performed in plays produced by Talawa, Britain\u2019s leading black theatre group, and participated in events at Word Up Women\u2019s Cafe, a space for performance poets.51 Reflecting her interest in diverse artistic forms, Mason-John\u2019s show Surfing the Crone, produced in conjunction with the Institute of Contemporary Arts (1997), drew her into collaboration with the choreographer Delta Streete and the musician Nigel Shaw. Similarly, The Adventures of \n13 \n \nSnow Black and Rose Red combines pantomime and carnival, fusing African, Caribbean, and Asian mythology to revise a classic European fairy tale. The show drew on pantomime\u2019s tradition of cross-dressing and rewrote the conventional heterosexual fairy tale plot to create a multicultural and queer show suitable for adults and children alike. After taking an MA in Creative Writing at Sussex University, Mason-John has also developed an interest in classic literary forms. This led to The Perfect Road (first produced in 2004), a one-woman show that simultaneously employs and subverts canonical forms by using the sonnet and villanelle, conventionally associated with romantic love, to represent child sex abuse.   Throughout her work, Mason-John repeatedly defies the conventions of realism, resisting the normative (white, male, heterosexual) perspective that realism presents as real and true.52 As the stage directions indicate, Sin Dykes shatters the \u2018fourth wall\u2019 that separates actors and audience at the outset: \u2018The audience enter into a clubby \natmosphere and are frisked by BD, the owner of the bar\u2019 (p. 43). Such a technique, which renders the audience active participants rather than passive observers, encourages people who have come to see the play to feel implicated in the action and to take responsibility for the issues raised. Like Sin Dykes, Brown Girl in the Ring uses mime and physical theatre, and The Banana Kid employs magic realist elements to reflect a child\u2019s imaginary world. In this sense, the novel is psychologically realistic even though it eschews realism. The theme of reincarnation, which gave the novel its original title (Borrowed Body), pulls The Banana Kid further away from a mainstream tradition of literary realism, as do Pauline\u2019s recurrent dreams about a Yoruba chief surrounded by ivory and gold, a figure that (subverting the boundaries of gender) transpires to be her former self - a man who sold his own people into slavery. The theme of spirits and reincarnation reflect Mason-John\u2019s cross-cultural influences. As she explains: \u2018When I was very young, my house parents used to do a ouija board after we went to bed, so I knew about poltergeists. And my mum did obeah. So both from a white European\u2019s perspective and from an African perspective, I was open to the spirit worlds\u2019.53 Ordained into the Western Buddhist Order in 2005, the theme of reincarnation is also informed by Eastern philosophy. The representation of Africa in a non-realist mode in \nThe Banana Kid, repeated in her short story \u2018Toxins\u2019,54  a fable that features speaking \n14 \n snakes, suggests that Africa figures in Mason-John\u2019s work as what Salman Rushdie terms an \u2018imaginary homeland\u2019.55\n \n Pursuing her subversion of realism, in Mason-John\u2019s next novel one of the narrators is a plant. \nWhilst continuing to write creatively, Mason-John also teaches creative writing \u2013 she was Writer in Residence at Holloway Prison (2005-6) - and now works as a trainer in anger management and conflict resolution based in Edmonton, Canada. This work lead to Detox your Heart, a self-help book about working with anger, fear and hatred, which examines in non-fictional form themes similar to those explored in \u2018Toxins\u2019, a short story about the destructive effects of negative thoughts and feelings. Her latest book, Broken Voices: \u2018Untouchable\u2019 Women Speak Out (2008), demonstrates her continuing commitment to women\u2019s issues and global politics.  \n \n \nEP: In Lesbians Talk: Making Black Waves and Talking Black: Lesbians of African and \nAsian Descent Speak Out you delineate a conflict between black lesbian feminist and queer politics. Does that conflict still exist in your view?  \nVMJ: It\u2019s not as marked as it was in the 1990s, when \u2018queer\u2019 was a term associated with white, gay North American men. Many black women do now identify as queer. These are women, often a younger generation of women, who play with gender.  \n \nEP: What does \u2018queer\u2019 mean to you? Is it a term that you embrace?  \nVMJ: \u2018Queer\u2019 is an interesting term because its meaning keeps on changing. Since the 1990s, the lesbian community has claimed it. But \u2018queer\u2019 doesn\u2019t just mean \u2018homosexual\u2019, it encompasses a range of identities, gay and straight. It includes bisexual and transgender people. \u2018Queer\u2019 covers a whole range of sexualities and genders. It means \u2018other\u2019 or \u2018different\u2019. It\u2019s a political term that permits greater freedom around gender and sexuality. \u2018Queer\u2019 indicates identities that are fluid. It loosens the attachment to binaries. For example, some lesbians date transgender men. What does that mean in terms of their sexuality? We live in a moment when a black man has become president of the USA. It feels like a time when anything is possible, and queer \n15 \n reflects that. Queer is liberating. \u2018Queer\u2019 is different to \u2018gay\u2019, which is a term that applies to homosexual people who live lives that are acceptable to the heterosexual community. I don\u2019t like labels, which can be restrictive as well as liberating. I was given my first label at age 5: \u2018orphan\u2019. Labels relating to race and gender came later. Still, I\u2019m attached to the label \u2018dyke\u2019, even though it\u2019s so last century and, despite that attachment, yes, I do see myself as queer. \n \nEP: Does \u2018queer\u2019 entail any limitations or impose its own hegemonies in your view?  \nVMJ: Limitations are inevitable. As a child queer meant \u2018strange\u2019 or \u2018different\u2019 but it\u2019s increasingly seen as normal. It\u2019s entered the mainstream, it\u2019s moved from the street into the academy. Queer enables academics who are straight to write about homosexuality, and men to teach Women\u2019s Studies. Queer hasn\u2019t necessarily diluted gay politics and women\u2019s politics but it has changed them. \n \nEP: What about the label \u2018feminist\u2019? \n \nVMJ: I feel privileged to have had the luxury of benefitting from the impact of feminism. Feminism seeks justice for women and the end of sexism, misogyny and patriarchal oppression in all its forms throughout the world. Feminism helped me to discover myself as a young woman. Having been raped, sexually abused, and silenced as a girl, I was an angry adolescent. Feminism allowed me to express this anger in a safe space, although I wouldn\u2019t say that feminism is about anger. It was the beginning of my healing as a black woman and the cultivation of self-love. When I heard that Andrea Dworkin had died in 2005, I rushed out and bought every paper. Although I haven\u2019t always acknowledged it, I realised then that feminism had played a large part in shaping who I am today. I mourned the loss of a feminist heroine, someone who had contributed so much to feminist theory. \nEP: Have race and sexuality complicated your relationship to feminism? Early on, I felt a resistance to feminism because it didn\u2019t speak about my individual experience as a black woman. As I became more aware of my black self, I felt alienated from white culture. bell hooks was the only feminist theorist that I identified with \n16 \n during that time. Her book Ain\u2019t I A Woman? liberated me. I realised I could be a feminist and be black. I didn\u2019t have to choose being black over being a woman anymore. They are both just as important to me. I also discovered feminists who were actively conscious about a feminist politics that included race, class, disability, globalisation, human rights, sexuality, sex work, the body, reproduction and much more. Joining a black-only lesbian feminist group was also part of my discovery of my black self. However, I wasn\u2019t able to embrace black lesbian feminist separatism wholeheartedly because my mothers had been white, and they were the first women I had learned to love. Becoming a black lesbian feminist separatist would have meant denying a part of my self. Black lesbian separatists also accused me of sleeping with the enemy for having white lovers. I have felt equally restricted by the black and white lesbian feminist community. My book Talking Black delighted the black lesbian feminist community and upset some white lesbian feminists. In Making Black Waves, the chapter \u2018Racism in the Margins\u2019 opens, \u2018All White people are racist, because they are socialised by western societies riddled with prejudice and ignorance\u2019. Because this was the first book on black and Asian lesbian culture, white women did not feel they could damn it. But when Talking \nBlack was published, white women vented their anger. It was okay for me to write that all men are sexist, but writing that all white women are racist was considered sacrilege. In the early 90s I was straddling white feminism and black feminism, and trying to work out if it was it better to be oppressed by my white sisters or my black brothers. \nEP: How did the black community respond to your books about lesbian feminism? \nVMJ: After we wrote Lesbians Talk, I remember saying to Ann Khambatta, tongue in cheek, \u2018I\u2019ll always have to be a lesbian writer now\u2019. I didn\u2019t realise that book would have such a huge impact on my career as a journalist. In the black community I went from being a serious writer who had given talks with John Pilger, Stuart Hood, and Marc Wadsworth to being forced underground. Despite the fact that I had almost secured an interview with Margaret Thatcher, until her office backed out during the 1987 election, I was no longer called up or commissioned to write articles for the black media. Doors closed. So I went into the gay press, where I ended up struggling to get black stories covered. However, feeling that my career as a journalist was over left me free to write \n17 \n \nSin Dykes, which incorporates all aspects of my feminist black lesbian self. To my surprise, black and white lesbians loved the play.  \nEP: How has feminism shaped your work? Feminism has affected my writing practice. My first show, Body Politics, was inspired by Ntozake Shange\u2019s play For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide when the Rainbow \nis Enuf (first produced in 1975 and published in 1977). The poems in Brown Girl in the \nRing initially formed the basis of my show Surfing the Crone, which was inspired by Clarissa Pinkola Este\u2019s book Women Who Run with the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the \nWild Woman Archetype. Also, Brown Girl in the Ring follows that feminist tradition of bringing to light women lost in history. Feminism, which is about putting women back on the map, is at the heart of my work, although Buddhism is another influence now. \nDetox Your Heart grew out of my Buddhist practise, as did Broken Voices, my book about Dalit women. I like to feel that, as a writer, I can write about anything, but feminism is always there as an undertone. So, yes, feminism has most definitely shaped my beliefs and all my writing is informed by feminism in some way.  \n \nEP: You\u2019ve written about your love of music, particularly blues, soul, funk and rave. In what ways does music reflect your cross-cultural heritage?  \nVMJ: Clubbing has been a very big part of my life. The first clubs I went to were Rock and Roll clubs, and I was a Teddy Girl. I was one of very few black Teddy Girls around at that time, and I used to get a lot of shit on the streets from other black people because rock and roll was considered white, but I discovered that it was a black musical form that had been appropriated by white artists. In the 1970s, clubs were part of a very white music scene in Britain. To get in, you had to not look like a typical black person, you had to look different, so when I was 17 I dyed my hair green, and that got me in. Also, I was very much one of Isaac Julien\u2019s young soul rebels.56\n \n Diasporas have had a great impact on English culture. You see the fusion of cultures on the streets, in shops and in fashion, but it\u2019s most clear in music. \n18 \n \nEP: Brown Girl in the Ring invokes the Boney M song. Is music an influence on your creative work? \n \nVMJ: A sense of rhythm is important. A good DJ will take clubbers on a journey similar to Gabrielle Roth\u2019s 5 Rhythms: flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical, stillness.  That\u2019s the journey I want to take my readers or audience on. \n \nEP:  Were your literary influences as cross-cultural as your taste in music? You\u2019ve said that Paule Marshall, Audre Lorde, Toni Morrison, Barbara Burford and Bernardine Evaristo inspired you.  Which other writers had an impact?  \nVJM: Enid Blyton\u2019s books were a big influence on me. I identified with George, the tom-boy in the Famous Five stories, and Barnabas, the itinerant circus-boy in The Barney Mysteries who didn\u2019t have a family. Forster\u2019s A Passage to India, which foregrounds race, and Hardy\u2019s The Return of the Native, which is about a small community, and what happens to people when they try to move away, both resonated with me. Suniti Namjoshi is one of my heroines. She\u2019s a brilliant writer. The historians C.L.R. James and E.P. Thompson were also an influence. I saw a film of these two great men \u2013one black and one white \u2013 in conversation. Initially, I wanted to be a historian. \n \nEP: How do you see your work in relation to that of other Black British writers such as Jean \u2018Binta\u2019 Breeze, Grace Nichols, Benjamin Zephaniah, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Beryl Gilroy, and Merle Collins? In what ways does your work emerge from theirs?   \nVMJ: These writers have been my role models. As a journalist, I interviewed most of them about their work before becoming a poet and fiction writer myself. They are inspirations \u2013 Linton Kwesi Johnson and Benjamin Zephaniah especially, as they wrote in a vernacular that brought back memories of toasting in blues and shabeams, where I spent much of my teens and twenties.57 This is where I found the inspiration to tell stories. In shabeams, someone would just get on a mike and toast over a record, and you would hear stories about what was happening in the black community and get the politics. It was uplifting and liberating. Today\u2019s hip hop originates from toasting.  I do use black English in some of my work - as this was one of the English vernaculars that I \n19 \n was immersed in during my adolescence. So these writers have helped me to find my own unique voice. This has been hard because, growing up, I didn\u2019t know who I was and I had to discover my voice as a writer. I was very English, passed as white, culturally, and didn\u2019t feel \u2018authentic\u2019 speaking patois, so I was stifled for a while. Finding my voice meant accepting my Englishness whilst still being black. \nEP: You\u2019ve said that black British writers no longer have to borrow from the African American experience to shape their aesthetic . Can you explain how you see the difference between the two? \n \nVMJ: The African American experience is one of slavery.  Africans were taken from the continent and placed in America as far back as the 1500s, so African Americans have a long history. In the UK, our history is different. We were taken as slaves and repatriated in the Caribbean and, although there were few of us in Britain from 1500s, and even earlier, we didn't come en masse until the 1950s. Therefore, we have limited generations; we don't have the history.  I am part of the first \u2018out\u2019, visible, ageing black lesbian and gay community in Britain.  Also where African Americans have civil rights leaders like Marcus Garvey, Martin Luther King, Malcom X , Rosa Parks, and many more, Britain has not cultivated or given the space to home grow our international leaders. Sadly, we are known for our riots. But we must not forget that the internationally acclaimed Notting Hill Carnival originated from a major political crisis. It was a response to the widespread racial attacks and race riots in 1958; in 1959 Claudia Jones established the first carnival to mark the depressing state of race relations.  \n \nEP: It\u2019s interesting that you identified with boys when you were growing up because you\u2019re also featured in Del LaGrace Volcano and Ulrika Dahl\u2019s book Femmes of Power: \nExploding Queer Femininities. Do you perceive your gender as fluid?  \nVJM: I go to the Michigan Womyn\u2019s Musical Festival, which is not seen as a politically correct thing to do in the queer community because it excludes transgender women. It\u2019s a lesbian feminist, women-only event for \u2018womyn born womyn\u2019. But it was there that I discovered the woman I want to be. In a totally free world, I\u2019d most likely be high femme, but I\u2019m not because it would attract too much attention from men. Also, there is \n20 \n a part of me that likes to play with gender. I can be very boyish, and the other night I went to a party dressed as a butch gangster. But I love being a woman. \n \nEP: You often blend different genres in your work, fusing fact, fiction and fantasy. What motivates your rejection of realism?  \nVMJ: I grew up around a lot of dysfunctional people. There were some really disturbed people in the assessment centres I was sent to. They were in other worlds. I use fantasy to explore those worlds, to explore dysfunction. Also, because of how I grew up, a black child in a white community, I look at the world differently. My view isn\u2019t normative, I look at the world through a different lens.  \nEP: Does your interest in mime and physical theatre suggest a mistrust of language?  \nVMJ: Language is more than just words. Through mime and physical theatre, I learned to use colour as a form of expression. I\u2019m interested in emotion, and mime and physical theatre express that. Also, I\u2019m interested in subtext: what people don\u2019t say, or what they say with the body. I\u2019m interested in splitting, the way in which people can say one thing but mean another, or way in which people can be in one place physically but mentally somewhere else. I\u2019m fascinated by the mind, how it works. That\u2019s what I try to capture in my work.   \nEP: Your different names reflect your multiple facets as a writer. Is naming part of a process of self-definition or reinvention for you?  \nVMJ: I have three names now: Valerie Mason-John, Vimalasara (my Buddhist name), and Queenie. In the kids\u2019 home, I was also known as \u2018Gruesome\u2019. I didn\u2019t know what it meant at the time but I knew it wasn\u2019t a nice name. So I went through a period of wanting to change my name. I like \u2018Queenie\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s a fun name. Mason-John is my mother\u2019s name. It sounds like a white, middle-class name but it\u2019s from Sierra Leone, where compound names are common. However, it\u2019s a slave name - I\u2019m descended from slaves. I feel less and less like a \u2018Valerie\u2019: \u2018Valerie Mason-John\u2019 is just my pen-name now.  Naming is linked to uprooting and re-rooting. In my next novel, one of the narrators is a plant, which is \n21 \n uprooted, relocated, and renamed. However, \u2018Who am I?\u2019 is a universal question and all people reinvent themselves. \n \nEP: Why was Borrowed Body republished as The Banana Kid? \n \nVMJ: Even though Borrowed Body won the Mind Book of the Year Award, Serpent\u2019s Tail wanted me to pay to keep it in print, so I took advice from the Author\u2019s Society and asked for the rights back. I then offered the book to the British Association of Adoption and Fostering (BAAF), who wanted to change the title to The Banana Kid.   \nEP: Did BAAF change the cover too? The image on the front of the book [the back view of a young black girl walking down a street alone] suggests that it is being marketed as a misery memoir now.  \nVMJ: Yes. The title Borrowed Body signals that the book is literary fiction whereas The \nBanana Kid makes it sound more like autobiography. That\u2019s a compromise, but one worth making to keep the book in print.  \nEP: Despite the success of Zadie Smith and Andrea Levy, do you think that publishers \u2013 and perhaps even some readers \u2013 want to put black British women writers in a particular literary box, one associated with personal experience rather than art?  \nVMJ: Well, yes, of course. Black writers appear in the \u2018black\u2019 section of book stores, and if we're lucky women may end up in the \u2018women\u2019s\u2019 section. There is much pressure on black writers to be seen to be writing about black issues. bell hooks in the USA speaks about this  - there is an expectation on black writers to produce particular narratives, but things are changing too.  \nEP: Englishness is a key theme in your work, and your attitude to Englishness is complex. For example, you told Deirdre Osborne that after emigrating to Canada you were suddenly seen as \u2018English\u2019, something you disliked,58 preferring to define yourself as \u2018British\u2019, but you recently asserted in a blog on your website entitled \u2018Proud to be \n22 \n English\u2019 (March 27, 2010) that for the first time in your life you feel that you can \u2018own\u2019 Englishness. What prompted this change?   \nVMJ: Growing up in England I was never made to feel English, because I was always told to go home by racists. If I was ever asked where I was from and I said \u2018England\u2019, the questioner would say \u2018No, where are you from?\u2019 What they wanted to hear was \u2018Africa\u2019. When they heard my parents were from Africa the questioner would proceed, \u2018So what is Africa like?\u2019 This was the narrative of my origins right up until I left the UK. In fact, I remember that, when travelling during my gap year, people in Europe did not believe black people came from England. I had to have stepped off a plane either from Africa or America. Now, in Canada, all people hear is the English accent. They think I speak fantastic English, although those who are sussed know I am English. It's hard to deny I'm English when in America or Canada because my language, the words I use, contextualise me. Plus there is bonding between English people outside of England. In my local bank, one of the workers was recently reminiscing with me about bonfire night, something typical to English culture. Also, in Canada I have more respect as a black person than I get in the UK.  The fact that I have an MA and honorary doctorate puts me above the average traditionally educated person. Canadians have a healthy or unhealthy respect for Brits, which makes it possible for me to be proud to be English. I'm no longer at the bottom of the social pile; in Canada, a lot of the stigma that is attached to blacks in Britain is foisted upon the first nations community. On one level I like that I can have an identity that isn't questioned anymore, I can own Englishness without it being questioned, but then being proud to be English means I also have to take on all the unsavoury things that England has done in the name of the empire. So being proud to be English is a koan for me.  \n  \nEP: You were born in Britain and have lived in Australia, India, and North America, but have described Africa as \u2018home\u2019. How do you define \u2018home\u2019? What determines the location of home for you?  \nVMJ: It\u2019s always changing, especially now that I\u2019ve moved to Canada. Diaspora is at the centre of my life, which means there are many homes. England is home because that\u2019s where my history is. Africa, or Sierra Leone, is also home because that\u2019s where I \n23 \n originate from. I have several families, too. I have the foster family, the children\u2019s home family...  \nEP: And now a Buddhist family?  \nVJM: Yes, a Buddhist family. So, home means many different things. Really, home for me is here in my body.  \nEP: Is homelessness always a negative state or can it be positive too? Do possibilities arise from unbelonging?  \nVJM: Most definitely. Homelessness brings enquiry, the potential to query. I\u2019ve always been homeless \u2013 literally as well as metaphorically. I have lived on the streets, and I chose to be homeless in order to take care of myself because my home wasn\u2019t safe. For some people, homelessness is about survival.  \nEP: Your work challenges myths about home, the idea that home is a place of security.  \nVJM: Having grown up in an orphanage, I am fascinated by other people\u2019s families, and I now understand that I had a lot more than some people who grew up in traditional families. I had stability. When people who come from a \u2018normal\u2019 family learn that I grew up in an orphanage, they sometimes say, \u2018Oh, you poor thing\u2019 but when I hear about their lives I think, \u2018No, you poor thing\u2019.   \nEP: Fathers don\u2019t feature much in your work, do they?  \nVJM: I don\u2019t know anything about my own father and I was brought up by women: my foster mother, my biological mother, and there were two mother-figures in the children\u2019s home. There\u2019s a father in my next novel and men play a bigger role. At one point I did try to find out about my father but then I let go of that desire. I think that freed me to write more about men. I now feel more interested in uncovering the truth about men rather that colluding with the idea that men are the enemy. Men have not \n24 \n been the only oppressors in my life. My unpublished poem \u2018Playing Dead\u2019 is about the sexual abuse of a daughter by a mother.  \nEP: What\u2019s your view of transracial and transnational adoption?  \nVJM: I was involved in the move to ban trans-racial adoption with Lemn Sissay in the 1980s. My partner and I have discussed adoption and we have looked at other countries but I believe that children need to be adopted by someone within their own country. People can give love, but children need their own culture, not just Western privilege.  \nEP: Your writing takes diverse forms: journalism, plays, poetry, short fiction, novel, blog. What determines your decision to tell a story in a particular form?  \nVJM: Accessibility. It\u2019s about reaching different audiences and as many people as possible. \n \nEP: What are you working on at the moment?  \nVJM: I am doing some research on slavery in Canada. I am working on the story of a wife of a slave-master who falls in love with her black female slave, and absconds with her lover by passing as a man. They survive by working as a circus act. I see this story visually, so I think it\u2019ll be a film.  I see myself as a writer rather than as a performer now, although I think I\u2019ll probably be remembered best for my hats and clothes. A woman once told me, \u2018I know you,\u2019 and then listed every outfit I have ever worn to a Pride march. I laughed.    \n                                                          1 Valerie Mason-John, \u2018Uncensoring my Writing\u2019 in Dimple Godiwala ed., Alternatives within the \nMainstream: British Black and Asian Theatres (Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars Press, 2006), 397-401, p. 397. 2 Valerie Mason-John, Detox Your Heart (Birmingham: Windhorse, 2005), p. 6. 3 Ibid., p. 398. 4 Valerie Mason-John, Brown Girl in the Ring in Deirdre Osborne ed., Hidden Gems (London: Oberon, 2008), 287-316. \n25 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                    5 Valerie Mason-John, Sin Dykes in Brown Girl in the Ring: Plays, Prose and Poems (London: Get a Grip, 1999), 99-112. \n6 Valerie Mason-John, The Banana Kid (2005.

Set in London against the backdrop of the Queen\u2019s Silver Jubilee celebrations, the film explores racism and homophobia in Britain in the late 1970s, epitomised by the murder of a gay black man at the start of the film and a series of hostile encounters between soul boys and skinheads. Yet, reflecting the radial potential for resistance and rebellion articulated by the graffiti slogan \u2018black and white unite and fight\u2019, adapted by Caz\u2019s punk lover to \u2018black and white unite and fuck\u2019, the film explores music\u2019s ability to bring people together, overcoming difference without erasing it, as well as the subversive possibilities engendered by inter-racial same-sex desire. 57 \u2018Blues\u2019 are parties that take place in a private house. An entrance fee is paid at the door, and people pay for drinks at a bar inside.  A \u2018shabeam\u2019 is an illegal club. This is Mason-John\u2019s spelling, a variant of \u2018shebeen\u2019. 58 Osborne, \u2018No Straight Answers\u2019, p. 16. \n"}
