However, although children were\nalso moved from cities during the blitz of 1940 and at the time of the rocket\nattacks in 1944, the initial wave of evacuation in September 1939 was in many\nways the most significant. Moreover the Our towns survey itself does merit re-\nexamination, not least because the book, along with a famous leader article in\nThe Economist, has already received some selective attention from both\ntraditional and revisionist historians.# Here we subject the survey to a more\nintensive examination, looking at the backgrounds of its authors, its content,\nand its influence and impact on contemporary debates.\nFor many years, the standard account of welfare during the Second World\nWar was that provided by Richard Titmuss in his civil history, published in\n1950 as Problems of social policy. As is well known, Titmuss argued that the\nevacuation and the blitz \u2018 stimulated inquiry and proposals for reform long\nbefore victory was even thought possible \u2019. Hence during five years of war, \u2018 the\npressures for a higher standard of welfare and a deeper comprehension of social\njustice steadily gained in strength\u2019. Certain health and welfare services, that\nhad been subject to striking class and regional variations in the 1930s, were now\nprovided on a much more generous level. School meals and milk, for instance,\nwere expanded quickly in the early 1940s as benefits that were available to all\nand were now \u2018free of social discrimination and the indignities of the poor\nlaw\u2019.$ Subsequently, of course, Titmuss elaborated his thesis on war and social\nchange to argue that earlier and later wars had generated a similar concern\nwith the quantity and quality of the population \u2013 wartime demanded an\nincrease in social discipline which the general public would tolerate only if\nthere was a corresponding reduction in social inequalities.%\nIn the era of what David Cannadine has referred to as \u2018welfare state\ntriumphalism\u2019, the Titmuss thesis had a considerable influence on the work of\npost-war historians. A. J. P. Taylor, for instance, concluded succinctly in 1965\nthat \u2018 the Luftwaffe was a powerful missionary for the welfare state \u2019, while\nW. G. Runciman, writing of relative deprivation, argued that the contacts\nbetween social classes that resulted from the evacuation \u2018were not always\nharmonious, but they forced on many people, however unwillingly, com-\nparisons which they would not otherwise have made\u2019.& Similarly, Derek Fraser\nnoted in 1973 that the evacuation led to greater state involvement in social\n# See, for example, E.

One recent social\npolicy textbook, for example, notes of the evacuation that \u2018 it was as if a stone\nhad been turned to expose the real nature and extent of child poverty and\ndeprivation\u2019.)\nYet while the Titmuss thesis has been influential, and is still followed in some\nhistorical accounts, there was evidence from the 1980s of increasing scepticism\namong revisionist historians. In the first edition of her biography of Beveridge,\nfor example, Jose Harris had echoed Titmuss in arguing that the evacuation\nrevealed to many middle-class people the extent of poverty among children in\nthe cities, and variations in the quality of social services.* However, by 1981 she\nhad become more critical and suggested that, with the opening of some of the\nofficial papers, the Titmuss interpretation required \u2018some kind of refinement\nand modification\u2019. She now argued there was little proof that the war \u2018 in itself\ninduced heightened government awareness of social welfare either as a tool of\nnational efficiency or as a means of enhancing social solidarity \u2019. And while she\nconceded there was evidence of a consensus on social policy issues, she\nsuggested that it was a consensus of a peculiar kind.\"! In more recent work, Jose\nHarris has placed social change in Britain during 1939\u201345 within the context\nof the wider European experience of the Second World War. The old \u2018home\nfront \u2019 thesis, she claims, underestimates the fact that the war was fought largely\nin defence of the pluralism of British social life, fails to take sufficient account\nof the ambiguities and contradictions in the popular desire for post-war social\nchange, and ignores the varied nature of wartime experiences.\"\"\nIn the specific case of evacuation, Jose Harris has suggested that the episode\nin fact confirmed middle-class stereotypes about the urban poor, while\nproblems associated with head lice and bedwetting did not reduce but\nincreased conflicts between social classes.\"# This was a thesis that had been put\n\u2019 D.

John Macnicol, in particular, had previously\nmaintained that in the case of family allowances, civil servants conceded to\npublic pressure in the 1940s, but did not necessarily accept the arguments of\nsocial reformers.\"$ Similarly, on the issue of the evacuation, Macnicol has\nargued that civil servants were reluctant to accept the evidence of deprivation\namong children, and maintained that education was more important than\nother measures to reduce poverty. Whereas Titmuss had drawn attention to\nsuch changes as increasing numbers of children receiving school milk, Macnicol\nhas claimed that the expansion had been planned before the war; it was bound\nup with wider policies for food distribution and rationing, and the temporary\ncessation of means-testing was dictated by the needs of wartime. Above all, the\nevacuation had also served to strengthen a behavioural analysis of poverty, and\nthis was reflected in the transition from the concept of the \u2018 social problem\ngroup\u2019 to a new stress on the \u2018problem family\u2019. Thus Macnicol argues that the\nevacuation merely reinforced differences between competing analyses of\npoverty, and he concludes that \u2018 the ideological consensus of wartime, so\nstressed by Titmuss and some historians, was something of a myth\u2019.\"%\nCloser examination of the revisionist interpretation reveals that it has a\nnumber of different underlying strands. In the first place, it is suggested that\nTitmuss draws too stark a contrast between the interwar years and the 1940s,\nand provides a misleading account of health and welfare in the earlier period.\nIn fact, spending by local authority health departments had been increasing,\nthe more \u2018progressive \u2019 areas were taking on new responsibilities including\nmunicipal hospitals, and other advances in social policy were already under\nconsideration. Secondly, the revisionists claim that the experience of evacu-\nation did not reveal the predicament of the urban poor to a sympathetic rural\nmiddle class, but actually heightened class differences instead of dissolving\nthem. The evidence of the health of evacuated schoolchildren was fragmentary\nand ambiguous \u2013 in this respect it was open to contrasting interpretations, and\nultimately inconclusive. Furthermore, there was little evidence that civil\nservants now accepted that the solution to deprivation was higher wages and\nimproved housing \u2013 rather minutes and memos show that they continued to\nput their faith in the education of both children and parents. Finally there is the\nsuggestion, notably in the work of Macnicol, that the period witnessed a\ntransition from the concept of the \u2018 social problem group\u2019 to the new\nconstruction of the \u2018problem family\u2019. The latter was more optimistic, in that\nrehabilitation was seen as the key, rather than segregation and sterilization as\npreviously, but what was also clear was that pathological interpretations of\npoverty remained influential.\nIt is perhaps because of the apparently all-embracing nature of the revisionist\ninterpretation that it has had such a considerable influence on recent accounts\n\"$ J.

Anne Digby, for instance, has\nnoted that \u2018evacuation probably reinforced class prejudices : the presence of\nsome bed-wetting and lice-ridden child evacuees gave credence to stereotypes\nof working-class life-styles \u2019, while Virginia Berridge has agreed that the\nevacuation promoted as much class antagonism and prejudice as solidarity.\"&\nSome have found it difficult to reconcile the allegedly limited impact of\nevacuation with the changes that did occur. Rodney Lowe, for example, has\nargued that greater contact between social classes increased rather than\nreduced prejudices, but he concedes that services had been shown as\nunacceptably uneven, and in this way calls for universal provision had been\nstrengthened.\"\u2019 But other recent studies have been adamant that the overseas\nevacuation scheme had a much more favourable impact on social change than\nits domestic equivalent, and have found little to substantiate the Titmuss thesis\nover a range of policy areas.\"( In the same vein, Steven Fielding writes that\nevacuation did not necessarily promote egalitarianism, and responses were\nmixed \u2013 the middle class wanted to help the poor but continued to oppose state\nintervention, and put their faith in improvements to the education of working-\nclass girls.\")\nIf there has been a sense of an emerging consensus on the impact of the\nevacuation, there have also been signs that other historians have reverted to the\ntraditional interpretation. Bob Holman, for example, has argued persuasively\nagainst the Macnicol thesis, while one of the most recent social histories of the\nperiod has concluded that \u2018evacuation of deprived inner-city children,\nsometimes displacing the comfortable classes from spacious homes, was a shock\nall round\u2019.\"* Moreover, it is an interesting paradox that while Macnicol argues\nthat the impact of the evacuation of children has been exaggerated, he\nconcedes that the parallel movement of the elderly did catapult the situation of\nold people into the political arena.#! This suggests that these debates have only\nserved to raise a number of further questions. These include the extent to which\nevacuation did create a mood for social reform, how far these changes were\n\"& A. Digby, British welfare policy: workhouse to workfare (London, 1989), p. 55 ; V.

Other questions relate to how far ideas on social policy\nmarked a decisive break with the previous decade, and whether continuities\nmay have been as striking as any changes. Here we use the Our towns report\nproduced by the Women\u2019s Group on Public Welfare as a means of undertaking\nthe task suggested by Harris. The article argues that it was the apparently\ncontradictory nature of the report that explains its powerful appeal in wartime\n\u2013 it echoed interwar debates about behaviour and citizenship, but also reflected\nthe ideas that would shape the welfare state in the post-war years.\nII\nBefore moving on to consider the content and impact of the Our towns report,\nit is important to try to uncover the backgrounds of individual committee\nmembers, and some of their ideological commitments and connections. The\nactual drafting of the report is difficult to follow since the papers of the\nWomen\u2019s Group on Public Welfare preserved at the Fawcett Library are\nincomplete for this early period. Moreover, tracing and contextualizing the\nmembers of the committee generates other methodological problems. But\nElizabeth Denby\u2019s private papers provide a fascinating guide to the writing of\nthe report in the period up to April 1941. What is clear is that the group was\nboth part of a longer-term tradition of the involvement of women in social\nquestions, and a more specific reflection of the political culture of the early\n1940s. Similar groups had been involved in the campaigns for improvements to\nmaternity and child welfare provision in the early 1900s, in the movement for\nfamily allowances, and in debates about child poverty in the 1930s.#\" The\nsurvey was undertaken by the hygiene sub-committee of the Women\u2019s Group\non Problems Arising from Evacuation, specifically as a response to the debates\ngenerated by the evacuation of schoolchildren in September 1939, and under\nthe umbrella of the National Council of Social Service (NCSS). This became\nthe Women\u2019s Group on Public Welfare in July 1940, aiming to focus on social\nservices, and subsequently produced other reports in the post-war period,\nincluding on the issue of child neglect. There is evidence that other groups were\ndisdainful of the Women\u2019s Group on Public Welfare, at least in the late 1940s.\nJames Hinton has pointed out that members of the Women\u2019s Voluntary\nService referred to it as \u2018an assembly of impractical theorists \u2019, claiming that\nthis was an example of a powerful anti-intellectual ethos that had deep roots in\nfemale philanthropy.##\nThe Our towns report was written by women, based largely on interviews with\nwomen, and was designed to influence policy-makers who were predominantly\nmen.

All we know is that, following pressure from the National\nFederation of Women\u2019s Institutes and National Union of Townswomen\u2019s\nGuilds, the NCSS convened a conference in September 1939 to consider certain\nproblems arising from the evacuation. A body known as the Women\u2019s Group\non Problems Arising from Evacuation came into existence in November 1939.\nThis was chaired by Margaret Bondfield, its members included Marjory Allen\nof Hurtwood, and the secretary was Letty Harford of the NCSS.#$ A sub-\ncommittee was set up on rural sanitation, water supply and personal hygiene,\nchaired by Amy Sayle. Its terms of reference were \u2018 to explore the problems of\nrural water supply and sanitation, and of manners and customs in the home,\nthat have been raised as the result of evacuation\u2019. The minutes of the first\nmeeting, held on 28 November 1939, show that it was attended by Amy Sayle,\nIrene Barclay, Elizabeth Denby, Mrs Henry Haldane, Letty Harford, and\nDora Ibberson.#%\nThe membership of the group bears closer examination. Marjory Allen of\nHurtwood is best known for her famous letter to The Times, published in July\n1944, that was instrumental in the setting up of the Curtis committee. Widow\nof Clifford Allen, active in the Labour party until he accepted a peerage in\n1932, she had been a prominent figure in the Nursery Schools Association\nduring the interwar period. Marjory Allen had first met Elizabeth Denby at\nIndependent Labour party summer schools, and was a close friend, but she\nherself was to play no active part in the deliberations behind Our towns.#&\nMargaret Bondfield, on the other hand, was to remain chairman of the\nWomen\u2019s Group on Public Welfare until 1948. She had previously been\nLabour MP for both Northampton and Wallsend, and minister for labour\n1929\u201331.#\u2019 Amy Sayle had earlier written on public libraries and housing, had\nbeen involved in the Women Public Health Officers\u2019 Association, and was a\nmember of the women\u2019s health enquiry committee.#( Of the other members,\nMrs Henry Haldane represented the National Federation of Women\u2019s\nInstitutes, Dora Ibberson was a civil servant, and Irene Barclay worked for the\nSt Pancras House Improvement Society.\nOne of the most interesting personalities in the group was Elizabeth Denby.\nShe had previously worked for the Kensington Housing Trust (1926\u201333), had\nbeen involved in the New Homes for Old exhibitions on slum clearance, and\n#$ Fawcett Library, London, Women\u2019s Forum A1, minutes of the Women\u2019s Group on Problems\nArising from Evacuation, 30 Nov. 1939.\n#% Ibid., minutes of the sanitation, water supply and personal hygiene sub-committee, 28 Nov.\n1939.\n#& On the Curtis committee see S.

She was a member of the avant-garde Modern Architectural\nResearch Group (MARS) founded in 1932, and on the fringes of the Architects\nand Technicians Organization (ATO), formed by Berthold Lubetkin in\n1935.#) Elizabeth Denby was a forceful personality, as her paper to the Royal\nInstitute of British Architects, given in November 1936, and the reaction to it,\nmake clear. Even Marjory Allen, one of her closest friends, conceded that\n\u2018Elizabeth\u2019s downright north-country ways did not suit everyone.\u2019#* But\nDenby was also an imaginative thinker whose Leverhulme fellowship, spent\nexploring low-cost housing in various European countries, led to a book-length\nstudy.$! It is tempting to regard Denby as holding very different views from the\nother members, but in fact she shared many of their ideas, and had been active,\nfor instance, in the movement for nursery schools in the 1930s.\nThe fact that the NCSS provided the secretarial support is interesting in light\nof its work in both rural and urban areas in the interwar period. Following its\ncreation in 1919, this body had been involved in the setting up of rural\ncommunity councils, and in social work in connection with unemployment.\nAnother dimension to its activities was provided by the New Estates\nCommunity Council (NECC), founded in 1928, and chaired by Professor\nErnest Barker. The NECC thought that the greatest problems facing society\nwere leisure and the breakdown of the traditional society, and it advanced a\nvision of \u2018community\u2019 based on centres and associations. Its role was that of an\nenabler, but it never attracted resources from the state. It has been suggested\nthat its views were ill-conceived, and that it had unreal expectations of both the\nworking and the middle class. The NECC regarded housing estates such as\nBecontree as flawed and dangerous, but it never tried to find out what the\ntenants of estates themselves wanted. Moreover, its solutions were drawn from\nclassical Greece, and they ignored the realities of party political, industrial, and\nclass conflicts.$\" Partly for these reasons, by the end of the 1930s the NCSS had\nbegun to rethink its role, and underwent some preliminary restructuring at the\noutbreak of war, including the creation of the Women\u2019s Group on Public\nWelfare.\nIf the influence of the NCSS was one strand, some of the members of the\nhygiene sub-committee had previous links with housing management. As a\ntechnique for civilizing tenants, this went back to the late nineteenth century\nand to Octavia Hill. As is well known, in 1866 she and John Ruskin had bought\n#) K.

However, she also\nwrote in 1864 that sanitary improvement depended on education, \u2018 that they\nmust be urged to rouse themselves from the lethargy and indolent habits into\nwhich they have fallen, and freed from all that hinders them from doing so\u2019.$#\nAlong with games for children, playgrounds, and maypoles, an opportunity to\nsee each family was provided by the weekly visits of the rent collector. Thus\nfemale housing managers collected the rents, supervised the cleaning, and gave\nadvice on repairs and improvements. Other forms of help aimed not to destroy\nindependence \u2013 helping tenants to find work, collecting savings, supplying\nthem with flowers, teaching them to grow plants, and providing amusement.$$\nThis continued to be the most important principle. In 1907 for instance,\nOctavia Hill wrote that \u2018building was never what I felt our main duty. It was\nalways the right management of the houses which I felt the greatest need.\u2019 It\nwas a system that was based on experience rather than theory, and which\ndepended on her individual capacity to work with the poor. She was convinced\nthat the regular visits of the rent collectors would lead to better habits among\nthe tenants. The fundamental aim was to remoralize relations between the\nlandlord and the tenant.$%\nThere were some problems with management in practice. By the 1880s and\n1890s, it was difficult to get caseworkers as well as tenants, and Octavia Hill\nwas ready to consider a more formal attempt at training workers. Nevertheless,\nhousing management remained an issue through the interwar period. Neville\nChamberlain, minister for health, for example, argued in 1933 that \u2018no scheme\nof slum clearance, or slum reconditioning will solve the problem or prevent the\nre-creation of slums, unless it is followed by enlightened and thoughtful\nmanagement\u2019.$& The London county council (LCC) appointed a housing\nmanager in 1912 and the Association of Women Housing Workers was formed\nin 1916, later becoming the Society of Women Housing Estate Officers.\nFurthermore, the Moyne committee on housing recommended that the\nOctavia Hill system should be extended, and housing management was\nexported to other countries in the 1930s, including South Africa.$\u2019 Recent\ndebates have indicated that housing management continues to be advocated\nby some as a solution to social exclusion on large housing estates.$( But in the\n1930s, this remained an undeveloped area of public administration.

The women housing managers were on the defensive and their\nviews largely ignored \u2013 wartime debates on social policy offered a platform for\ntheir ideas.\nIn these ways, the Our towns report and its authors can be located in the\ncontext of social thought in the 1930s. And though set up as a way of pooling\nexpertise, it is clear that from the outset this diverse group had rather different\nideas. An early memo circulated by Dora Ibberson, for example, argued that\nthe problem before the sub-committee was that of \u2018 the ways of living of the\ntown mother\u2019. In her view, the group\u2019s main objective should be to find out\nhow homes had produced girls who as mothers were \u2018 insanitary and offensive\nin their personal habits \u2019.$) This predominantly educational focus was in\ncontrast to the more overtly political stance taken by Margaret Bondfield. In\na radio broadcast of December 1939, for instance, she argued that evacuation\nstrengthened calls for social reform, noting that \u2018we have not cared enough\nabout the poverty, unemployment, and ill health that have made havoc of\npeople\u2019s lives \u2019. Her talk was subsequently reprinted in the press, with the\ntitle \u2018Towards a better Britain\u2019.$* The suggestion that the group was fractured\nby disagreements is supported by other sources. In her autobiography, Irene\nBarclay confirmed that there were tensions between Amy Sayle and Elizabeth\nDenby, and claimed that she and Letty Harford were the mediators.%!\nAlthough the stated aim was to study both rural sanitation and urban\ncustoms, by the time of the next meeting, in December 1939, the emphasis had\nshifted more towards cleanliness and personal habits.%\" Indeed, this was\nreflected in a change of name, since by January 1940, the group had become\nthe hygiene sub-committee. Otherwise it proceeded in the normal way, given\nlimited resources, by examining evidence, allocating tasks to individual\nmembers, and interviewing witnesses. Thus Elizabeth Denby surveyed the\nmedical officer of health (MOH) reports for Manchester, Liverpool,\nDerbyshire, and Hampshire, and there were studies of individual areas, in\nwhich Denby looked at Paddington, Sayle at Battersea and Shoreditch,\nBarclay at St Pancras and Stepney, and Harford at Sheffield. The group passed\nvarious resolutions relating to ministry of health policy on housing and slum\nclearance.%# In later months, the meetings of the sub-committee were primarily\n$) Building Research Establishment, Garston, Hertfordshire, Elizabeth Denby papers, 116674,\nD.

The meetings now\nincluded a couple of additional members, Fabian Brackenbury, a lecturer in\nhealth education at Avery Hill Training College, and Cicely McCall, of the\nNational Federation of Women\u2019s Institutes.%% In June, the sub-committee\nconsidered an analysis, prepared by Letty Harford, of the evidence of the\nexpert witnesses on \u2018personal hygiene and insanitary habits \u2019 under the\nheadings \u2018 facts \u2019, \u2018causes \u2019, and \u2018remedies \u2019.

As earlier, this had been drafted by Ibberson, but the title\npage was reworded, including the dates 1939\u201342 and omitting the word\n\u2018evacuation\u2019, in order to give the impression that the report had not been\ndelayed quite so much.&!\nIt is not clear why the publication of the survey, very much a study of the\ninitial wave of evacuation in September 1939, was delayed until March 1943.\nCertainly it cannot be explained in terms of the survey\u2019s methodology or scope,\nwhich verged on the superficial and amateurish. It is, of course, quite possible\nthat the report was completed at an earlier date, put aside, and then hurriedly\nissued in the aftermath of the Beveridge report. But the explanation is more\nprosaic, namely, problems with publishers that were perhaps inevitable in\nwartime. Penguin had exceeded its paper quota and Oxford University Press\nwould only publish the book at a cover price of 5s if the text was cut to 50,000\nwords. This editorial work was undertaken by Celia St Loe Strachey, whose\nhusband John had been Labour MP for Aston in 1929\u201331. Indeed, publication\nat a subsidised price, of 5s instead of 6s, was only possible because the Russell\nSage Foundation contributed $500 towards the printing costs of the report,\nfollowing an address by Margaret Bondfield at the National Social Work\nCouncil in New York.&\"\nMost of the underlying tensions were hidden in the published version of the\ntext. The only addition to the members mentioned above was P. Spafford,\nsecretary of the Ling Physical Education Association. It is interesting to\ncompare the report\u2019s methods with some of the other evacuation surveys, such\nas the Cambridge survey conducted by Susan Issacs, and the report by Mass\nObservation. While the Our towns survey relied on methods that might appear\nrather amateurish, it was also noticeable that on some issues the committee had\ntaken steps to draw on expert opinion. Its authors stated that they had\nconducted their survey largely through interviews, but also thanked a few\nprominent scientists and doctors for their help. These included Dr Kenneth\nMellanby, a scientist based at the Sorby Research Institute, University of\nSheffield, Dr Alison Glover of the ministry of health, and Dr Samuel Gill of the\nGuardianship Society in Brighton \u2013 all of whom had written elsewhere on\naspects of the evacuation.&# Despite Glover\u2019s involvement, the reality was that\nthe ministry of health had refused to take any official responsibility for the\nreport, and offered only informal comments on earlier drafts.&$ In commercial\n%* Ibid., G.

The report opened with a quotation from the final volume\nof Charles Booth\u2019s social survey, and it comprised an introduction, four\nchapters, and a bibliography, along with some fourteen appendices. In effect,\nthe first chapter provided an overview of the evacuation of schoolchildren in\nSeptember 1939, and of some of the debates that had been generated by the\nexperience. Chapter 2 was entitled \u2018Living below standard (1) \u2019, and included\nsections on such matters as \u2018wrong spending\u2019, \u2018 juvenile delinquency and want\nof discipline \u2019, and \u2018dirty and inadequate clothing\u2019. The third chapter followed\nwith \u2018Living below standard (2) \u2019, and this looked among other topics at\n\u2018 insanitary habits \u2019 and \u2018bodily dirtiness \u2019. The fourth chapter examined the\nfuture of social reform, notably with regard to what could be done in terms of\nboth education and the environment, and it was followed by a brief conclusion.\nIn all, the pocket-size report numbered some 143 pages.\nThe introduction stated that the survey aimed to take the accusations that\nhad been levelled at the evacuees, to see what evidence existed for them in\nurban areas, and to suggest ways in which the problems might be solved.\nInterestingly, the report immediately launched into an examination of the\n\u2018residuum\u2019, writing that the \u2018submerged tenth\u2019 unearthed in the social surveys\nof Charles Booth still existed in towns, \u2018 like a hidden sore, poor, dirty, and\ncrude in its habits, an intolerable and degrading burden to decent people\nforced by poverty to neighbour with it \u2019. And it alleged that within the\n\u2018submerged tenth\u2019 were the \u2018problem families \u2019, who were \u2018always on the edge\nof pauperism and crime, riddled with mental and physical defects, in and out\nof the courts for child neglect, a menace to the community of which the gravity\nis out of all proportion to their numbers \u2019.&& The concept of the \u2018 social problem\ngroup\u2019 had been a minor but important aspect of social thought in the early\n1930s, following the publication of the Wood Report on Mental Deficiency.\nThe group was seen as being incapable of being rehabilitated, so that the\nsolutions were segregation or sterilization. In contrast, \u2018problem families \u2019 were\nperceived as being individual families \u2013 although mental deficiency was still\nregarded by some as a cause, there was a more general belief that, through\nlessons in home-making, they could be rehabilitated.&\u2019\nIn many respects, therefore, the Women\u2019s Group on Public Welfare can be\nseen to have been a group whose interpretation of social problems was\n&% Ibid., A14, minutes of the Women\u2019s Group on Public Welfare, 6 Apr. 1943.\n&& Women\u2019s Group on Public Welfare, Our towns \u2013 a close up: a study made in \u0081\u0089\u0083\u0089\u2013\u0081\u0089\u0084\u0082 with certain\nrecommendations by the hygiene committee of the Women\u2019s Group on Public Welfare (London, 1943), p. xiii.\n&\u2019 C.

And there\nwas much to substantiate these views in the remainder of the survey. The first\nquestion that the report dealt with, for example, was that of \u2018wasteful\nspending\u2019 on drinking and smoking, the football pools and betting in general,\nand on sweets, comics, and pocket money. On the issue of alcohol, for instance,\nOur towns stated that \u2018 the troubles of the \u2018\u2018problem family\u2019\u2019 generally include\nexcessive drinking by some of its members, and the worst mother is still\ngenerally the drinking woman\u2019.&( Similarly, the report took a puritanical\napproach to smoking, noting that it was both damaging to health and\nencouraged \u2018selfish spending\u2019.&) Although comments on the fecklessness of\nworking-class parents were a staple of social surveys, this tone also permeated\nthe survey\u2019s attempts to discuss a range of other issues.\nThe evacuation, and the experience of winter in the countryside, had shown\nthat many city children had footwear and clothing that were inadequate \u2013\nlarge numbers wore the plimsolls that were sold in street markets. Our towns\nproposed that the board of education should promote needlework lessons for\nparents in schools and clubs, and in other institutions including maternity and\nchild welfare centres and evening institutes. It was suggested that boys could\nalso be taught tailoring, mending, and knitting, and that the older children\nmight learn how to make boots and shoes.&* Similarly, the issue of malnutrition\namong children had been a controversial issue during the 1930s when both the\nassessment of malnutrition at school medical inspections and the provision of\nschool meals in depressed areas came under closer scrutiny. The Our towns\nreport was critical of the \u2018 slum diet \u2019 of the interwar years, arguing that its\nreliance on white bread, tea, sugar, sausages, jam, and margarine was \u2018 the\nworst ever devised by mankind, so grossly lacking is it in protective elements \u2019.\nBut it recommended that better eating habits should be encouraged through a\npublicity campaign on nutrition, and by educating both parents and children\nabout diet and different ways of preparing food.\u2019! In this, the Our towns survey\nechoed the emphasis on education that had been a core feature of official\npropaganda on malnutrition in the interwar period.\nThe evacuation experience had suggested that schoolchildren in some urban\nareas had a high incidence of head lice and skin disease, and it was this issue\nthat had caused problems between evacuees and their hosts in September 1939.\nIt was claimed of children evacuated from Manchester to Grimsby and Hull,\nfor example, that their clothes had had to be burnt, they were so \u2018dirty and\nverminous \u2019. As was the case on the question of nutrition, the Our towns survey\ntook a punitive approach to the problem, and again focused on the importance\nof education. It recommended that the Home Office should send a circular to\nmagistrates on the treatment of \u2018neglectful \u2019 parents, and that the Central\n&( Women\u2019s Group on Public Welfare, Our towns, p. 13. &) Ibid., p. 18.\n&* Ibid., p. 65. \u2019! Ibid., p. 34.\nthe OUR TOWNS report of 1943 795\nCouncil for Health Education should mount a publicity campaign.\u2019\" On skin\ndiseases, too, the report associated complaints such as impetigo and scabies\nwith \u2018wrong feeding\u2019 and neglect. It recommended that health visitors should\nstep up the pace of home-visiting, and thought that families would be treated\nmore effectively in the new health centres envisaged as part of the National\nHealth Service. The question of skin disease led the report\u2019s authors to look\nmore carefully at the issue of cleanliness, but again it echoed the board of\neducation in arguing that the development of physical training, swimming,\nand games had achieved much in improving hygiene.\u2019#\nAlthough the report was predominantly concerned with aspects of the\nphysical condition of children, it also devoted some space to their mental health\nneeds. In this respect, the report was preoccupied with an alleged increase in\njuvenile delinquency. It linked this to poor housing and overcrowding, but also\nassociated it with subnormal intelligence and \u2018bad training\u2019, noting that \u2018 those\nin whom it is lacking are often not so much perverted as socially untrained\u2019.\u2019$\nOne reason for concern was that the number of children classified as \u2018dull and\nbackward\u2019 was believed to be on the increase \u2013 separate classes should be\nprovided for them in schools. This might have had positive implications had\nthe report not gone on to make several other dubious assumptions. For Our\ntowns claimed that \u2018dull \u2019 children grew up to increase the number of the\n\u2018 feeble-minded\u2019 and produced \u2018problem families \u2019 \u2013 their lack of intelligence\nled to \u2018bad spending and household management, undeveloped character and\nlack of parental control \u2019.\u2019% In particular, it was thought that the key to juvenile\ndelinquency lay with the \u2018problem family\u2019, so that further investigations of this\nphenomenon were desirable if not essential.\nSome health problems were regarded as being inherent in certain social\nclasses. The hygiene sub-committee wrote of bedwetting for instance, that \u2018no\nother aspect of evacuation produced greater scandal and none suggested more\nsqualid aspects in the home life of some of our town population\u2019.\u2019& It argued\nthat bedwetting was primarily caused by poor training in infancy, and could\nnot be cured in later life \u2013 it was both a case of \u2018 inferior maternal care or\nstandards \u2019 and a problem of \u2018certain social strata\u2019. Noting that families living\nin tenement blocks did not have easy access to toilets, the report remarked that\n\u2018 to the lazy and weak they are an encouragement to dirty habits \u2019, and it\nrecommended that this should be tackled through health education.\u2019\u2019\nYet while this behavioural emphasis was clearly evident in the report, other\nreadings are possible which suggest that it had a different character. Although\nthe authors hoped that their findings would help to consolidate support for a\nnew survey of the \u2018 social problem group\u2019, Our towns also had an environmental\nbias that was more in keeping with the outlook of the reconstruction movement.\nThus in the words of the authors, the evacuation of schoolchildren had\nprovided \u2018a window through which English town life was suddenly and vividly\n\u2019\" Ibid., p. 75. \u2019# Ibid., pp. 80\u20131, 96\u20137. \u2019$ Ibid., p. 47.\n\u2019% Ibid., pp. 51, 103. \u2019& Ibid., p. 81. \u2019\u2019 Ibid., pp. 85\u20136, 88\u20139.\n796 john welshman\nseen from a new angle \u2019.\u2019( Throughout the introduction, the authors wrestled\nwith the question of whether improvements in education, or progress on\nenvironmental factors, were more likely to solve the problem of poverty. At the\nsame time, the report was critical of official reports that simply described health\nand welfare services, failed to explore the extent of need, and ignored the\nreasons why people failed to take up the existing services.\nOn the question of juvenile delinquency, for instance, the report suggested\nthat further efforts should be made to \u2018detect \u2019 those children subsequently\nclassified as \u2018dull and backward\u2019, and to improve provision for them. It was\nargued that greater use should be made of the 1930 Children and Young\nPersons Act, and parents who persistently neglected children should be\nprosecuted.\u2019) The Our towns report suggested that there should be more\npsychological studies of the way that family and sexual relationships were\naffected by poverty and overcrowding. And above all, juvenile delinquency\nwas seen as being as much an environmental as a behavioural problem. Thus\nthe solutions proposed were those \u2018which promote happy home life, such as\neconomic stability, good housing, provision of a wide range of recreational\ninterests for both parents and children, and good education in parenthood\u2019.\u2019*\nOther psychological problems, such as the issue of bedwetting, led the\nreport\u2019s authors to consider more fundamental issues such as housing. Given\nthe composition of the group, this was an area where it had particular expertise.\nIt noted that bedwetting was caused by a combination of social, medical, and\npsychological factors, and argued that these deserved much more attention\nthan they had received hitherto. Above all, the issue of bedwetting led the\nhygiene sub-committee to confront the question of poor housing. It admitted\nthat many towns still had primitive systems of sanitation that relied on privy\nmiddens and cesspools \u2013 toilets were often accessible only across waste ground,\nand many were in a \u2018disgraceful \u2019 condition.(! In the London borough of\nClerkenwell, for instance, each toilet was shared by seven or eight families,\nwhile a survey of 400 children had revealed that only 104 had an indoor water\ncloset. The authors of Our towns argued that these conditions made it very\ndifficult for mothers to train their children, and they also noted that toilet\nblocks in schools were often of a poor standard. They recommended that each\nfamily should have a toilet accessible without going down more than one flight\nof stairs, and also thought that MOHs should inspect sanitation in homes and\nschools.(\"\nAs we have seen, the report blamed parents for the state of the evacuees\u2019\nfootwear and clothing, and recommended needlework classes in schools. But\nOur towns also produced a perceptive account of a problem that had remained\nlargely hidden throughout the 1930s. It found that although school medical\ninspections in London suggested that most children were well clothed, 13 per\ncent of the 31,000 children registered for evacuation in Newcastle had footwear\n\u2019( Ibid., p. xi. \u2019) Ibid., p. 53. \u2019* Ibid., p. 51.

If Our towns offered incisive criticisms of official reports, it\nalso showed a sensitive grasp of the way that the problem of child poverty was\nillustrated by their footwear and clothing. Children from poor families slept in\ntheir underwear as they had no night-clothes, they never wore overcoats or\nraincoats, and they had no spare sets of underwear \u2013 in the case of shoes,\nchildren often obtained footwear through school clubs, and repairs placed a\nheavy strain on family budgets.($\nOn the question of malnutrition, the report was critical of the statistics that\nhad been generated by school medical inspections. Again this had been a\npersistent bone of contention between the board of education and its critics\nthroughout the interwar period. Our towns helped to turn the tide by showing\nhow the system produced subjective statistics, depressed areas had generated\nimprobable results, and the board\u2019s statements about malnutrition had been\ncontradicted by John Boyd Orr and other experts. It is likely that this section\nwas drafted by Dr Alison Glover, given his earlier unpublished comments on\nmalnutrition and school medical inspections. While we have already noted that\nthe report was critical of the \u2018 slum diet \u2019, it also conceded that this was as much\na matter of money as an issue of ignorance. Housewives who had no proper\nstorage facilities had to avoid fresh milk and fish, they shopped just for the next\nmeal, and they relied on take-away food \u2013 meals took on the character of\npicnics because they were prepared in \u2018picnic conditions \u2019.(% Some of the\nsuggestions were based on improving knowledge of food preparation and\ncooking. But the Our towns report also thought that restaurants, pubs serving\nfood, and milk and potato bars should be established in the poorer urban areas.\nMore generally, the provision of school meals should be expanded, and\nwartime rationing form the basis of a permanent policy to ensure that every\nhousehold received an adequate diet.(&\nOne of the most persistent allegations levelled at the evacuees had concerned\nthe high incidence of head lice and skin disease. Here again the approach and\nconclusions of the Our towns report were striking. On head lice, the report\ncontrasted the figures generated by school medical inspections with the results\nof Kenneth Mellanby\u2019s survey, and argued that accurate figures could only be\nobtained by unannounced examinations. Similarly, the national averages for\nskin disease in the annual reports of the chief medical officer disguised the\nincidence among urban children, and it was suggested that the presentation of\nstatistics should receive \u2018urgent attention\u2019.(\u2019 The survey reflected other\ncurrents of the mid-1940s in arguing that the training of school doctors and the\n(# Ibid., p. 54.

(\u2019 Ibid., pp. 78\u201381, 95.\n798 john welshman\ncurriculum of medical schools should be supplemented by the new discipline of\nsocial medicine. Perhaps most importantly, these questions directed attention\nto the issue of housing. Here Our towns argued that the pace of rehousing and\nslum clearance should be accelerated, sanitary inspection strengthened, and\nlocal authorities make full use of their powers, particularly with respect to\nwater supplies. Again its approach was compassionate \u2013 it was difficult for\nwomen living in houses that lacked hot water or good drying conditions to keep\ntheir children clean, and head lice were eradicated only \u2018at the cost of\nunremitting vigilance and toil \u2019.((\nThe Our towns report culminated in a series of wide-ranging suggestions that\nembodied the earlier sections of the book. Some echoed the previous\nrecommendations on education, arguing, for instance, that the expansion of\nnursery schools would \u2018cut off the slum mind at its root \u2019.() The use of this\nhorticultural metaphor was hardly surprising since in the interwar period,\nnursery schools had been viewed by the voluntary housing sector as a vital part\nof rehousing schemes. Marjory Allen had been involved in the Nursery Schools\nAssociation, and a nursery school had been included in Elizabeth Denby\u2019s\nKensal House development. The actual development of nursery schools had\nbeen fairly limited \u2013 in April 1937, for instance, only eighty-seven were\nrecognized by the board of education, and attended by some 6,735 children.\nPerhaps because their alleged efficacy had not been tested, nursery schools were\nregarded by many as an important means of training children and civilizing\nparents.(* But the content of the survey meant that other recommendations\nhad a different emphasis. On the issue of housing, for instance, it argued that\nmany local authorities remained complacent and that \u2018Britain\u2019s slums are\nwidespread and a source of shock and scandal to fellow-citizens of the\nEmpire.\u2019)! It highlighted the problem of poverty, writing that \u2018poverty leads to\nbad housing without the space, water supply, food storage, cooking facilities\nand private sanitation essential to good home-making\u2019. The hygiene sub-\ncommittee was particularly concerned about poverty in children under five,\nand advocated not just nursery schools from the age of two, but family\nallowances and minimum wages. Despite advances in some health and welfare\nservices, it argued that services fell short of what was necessary and \u2018great and\nradical reforms are needed to give humanity its chance\u2019.)\"\nIV\nSo much for the background and content of the Our towns report. But how was\nthis complicated amalgam of views received at the time, and what impact did\nthe survey have on contemporary debates about social policy? One approach\n(( Ibid., pp. 8, 66\u201374.

Women\u2019s Group on Public Welfare, Our towns, p. 102. )\" Ibid., pp. 103, 111.\nthe OUR TOWNS report of 1943 799\nto this question might be to trace the way that the book was reviewed at the\ntime of publication. It did not have sufficient literary merit to appear in the\nleading periodicals of the period. Moreover, the plans of the Women\u2019s Group\non Public Welfare for following up the report through a cheap edition, film,\nand other research projects made little headway.)# But it was published at the\nheight of debates about the Beveridge report and post-war reconstruction, and\nthis added to its impact. As far as newspapers were concerned, a lengthy review\nappeared immediately in The Times, where it also generated an important\nleader article and several letters from readers. Subsequently, it was picked up\nby a large number of specialist magazines and periodicals. While measuring the\nimpact of a survey through reviews is problematic, it is arguable that a suitably\nwide range does provide a reasonably accurate guide to public opinion, at least\nin educated circles. A second approach might be to look for mentions in\npolitical debates and in official papers. The report was discussed, for instance,\nin a House of Lords debate in May 1943, in the White Paper on Educational\nreconstruction, and in numerous articles and surveys about the \u2018problem family\u2019.\nFinally, it is also worth asking how far the Our towns survey influenced Titmuss\nhimself, and the distinctive interpretation that he advanced in Problems of social\npolicy.\nIn some respects, the report simply confirmed existing views, particularly\nabout the \u2018social problem group\u2019 that had been a minor but important current\nin intellectual life in the 1930s. This was certainly the way that Our towns was\ninterpreted by groups such as the Eugenics Society. In the Eugenics Review, for\ninstance, David Caradog Jones argued that despite rising living standards,\nthere still remained a hard core of \u2018 social problem cases \u2019, who were\n\u2018handicapped by subnormal intelligence if not by actual defect of body or\nmind\u2019. He used the evidence of the report to recommend an inquiry into the\n\u2018social problem group\u2019.)$ But the emphasis of other reviews was more\ntraditional, since they chose to focus on the alleged fecklessness of the working\nclass that had always been a feature of urban social surveys. The editorial in\nThe Economist noted of the Our towns report that \u2018bad food\u2019 was not always the\nresult of poverty, but was more often a reflection of parental ignorance or\nindifference, and that bedwetting was not linked to poor housing conditions\nbut was \u2018 the product of a low social standard\u2019.)% And this was evident across the\npolitical spectrum. Even Joan Clarke, secretary of G. D. H. Cole\u2019s recently\nestablished Social Security League, noted in her review in the New Statesman\nthat \u2018 slums breed slum habits of mind\u2019.)&\nGiven this evidence, it was natural that education was regarded as a solution\n)# Fawcett Library, Women\u2019s Forum D7, minutes of the follow-up committee on Our towns, 30\nSept. 1943.\n)$ D.

The Medical Officer, representing doctors employed by local\nauthorities, observed that the three most serious problems were poverty, the\nenvironment, and education, and of these the last was the most important.\nSimilarly a review in Social Work noted that there were two outstanding features\nof the report : \u2018our failure to educate our girls as home-makers, in spite of seventy\nyears of compulsory education, and our failure to provide our people with the\nraw material for home-making \u2019.)\u2019 Many picked up on the recommendations in\nOur towns about nursery schools, claiming that it was crucial to influence\nchildren before they reached school age. A leader article in the British Medical\nJournal, for example, suggested that it was a poverty not caused by lack of\nmeans, but by \u2018 lack of personal discipline and social standard\u2019. It suggested\nthat better housing could do little for children whose parents were lazy and\nincompetent, and it was the nursery school \u2018which can break the insanitary\nentail and prevent the sins of the fathers \u2013 more often than the sheer fecklessness\nof the mothers \u2013 from being visited upon the children\u2019.)(\nBut there was also evidence that the Our towns survey popularized the\nconcept of the \u2018problem family\u2019, and strengthened behavioural interpretations\nof poverty in the immediate post-war years. The deputy MOH for Liverpool,\nfor example, claimed that the war had \u2018thrown a rather lurid light upon the\nseamier side of town life \u2019, and he later wrote that Our towns had shown that\nstandards in many areas were \u2018horribly low\u2019.)) An article in the New Statesman\nnoted that the report had directed attention to the \u2018submerged tenth\u2019, while a\nsocial survey of Luton mentioned the book and suggested that \u2018an aspect of the\nrekindled interest in the social problems of our times has been an increased\nattention to the problem family\u2019.)* The Eugenics Society argued that it was\nduring the evacuation that the concept of the \u2018 social problem group\u2019 was\nreplaced by the theme of the \u2018problem family\u2019, and Our towns certainly was\nimportant in the creation of family service units, voluntary organizations that\nfocused on this form of social work.*! The logic and implications of this\ntransition were never clearly formulated.*\" But the \u2018problem family\u2019 did\nbecome an important issue in the 1950s, not least because it was mentioned in\nministry of health circulars, and included in the work of local authority health\ndepartments.\n)\u2019 N.

Almost all agreed that the\nevacuation had raised issues concerning poverty and health care that had been\nignored in the 1930s, and about which people living in the countryside knew\nlittle. The famous editorial in The Economist, for example, had the headline\n\u2018Spotlight on poverty \u2019, and it argued that evacuation had revealed to the\ngeneral population \u2018the black spots in its social life \u2019.*# Similarly the review in\nSocial Work found that \u2018poverty and squalor have been so carefully hidden\nbehind Nottingham lace curtains that their existence has been largely\nforgotten\u2019, and it thought that later social historians would regard this as the\nmost important result of the evacuation.*$ The Lancet believed the evacuation\n\u2018not only provided a large-scale social experiment, but lifted the lid off the less\nexposed corners of our towns\u2019.*% The New Statesman noted that major criticisms\nof the social and economic structure were implicit throughout the book, as were\nradical proposals for change, and it concluded that \u2018 this is definitely not a\nbookshelf book but a social document, which, being read, should be used for\npolitical action\u2019. It recommended the survey to social workers, administrators,\nand trade unionists, claiming that \u2018a revolution in education and a rapid\nhousing programme must underpin anything of value in the post-war world\u2019.*&\nAlthough some reviews emphasized behavioural interpretations of poverty,\nothers stressed the part played by environmental factors. While the Medical\nOfficer thought that education was necessary, it argued that \u2018education is not\npossible in an unfavourable environment so to improve education we must also\nimprove environment and the expenses of both must fall largely on the\ncommunity\u2019.*\u2019 The journal Public Administration was similarly perplexed, asking\nwhether the \u2018slum dweller \u2019 made the slum or if he was a victim of his\nenvironment. However, it went on to argue that while human nature was one\nfactor, \u2018economic and social conditions make it extraordinarily difficult for\npeople to live at a reasonable standard and train their children\u2019.*( Moreover,\neugenics had moved rapidly in the 1930s to embrace environmentalism. David\nCaradog Jones, for instance, argued that \u2018 there is everything to be said for a\ncontinued and even more energetic crusade to improve the environment and to\nhelp people to make the most of such good qualities as they possess \u2019.*) Thus\nthere is a danger of drawing too strong a dichotomy between the\nsupposedly \u2018radical \u2019 and \u2018reactionary\u2019 aspects of the survey.\nThe impact of the report may be clarified if one looks at particular\nprofessional groups. Its focus on the performance of local authority health\nservices in the 1930s made Our towns of particular interest to the journals that\nrepresented public health doctors.

In its original review, for instance,\npublished in April, the Medical Officer had stressed the importance of education,\nclaiming that \u2018 if we can solve our educational problem we can remedy our\nsocial evils \u2019.\"!! Nevertheless, by the time that a fourth impression appeared in\nOctober, the journal was taking a different stance. It argued that previous\nreports on health services for mothers and infants, and for schoolchildren, had\nnot revealed the reality of social conditions \u2013 official reports should be more\nthorough, and local doctors should make more accurate surveys of the areas\nthey supervised. The Medical Officer now concluded \u2018that the root cause is\npoverty is not to be questioned and the felling of Beveridge\u2019s five giants will be\nfound imperative if any real advance is to be made\u2019.\"!\"\nIt was natural that medical journals would look particularly at the survey\u2019s\ncomments on health services and that education journals would be more\nconcerned with schools. A review in the Times Educational Supplement, headed\n\u2018Life in the urban slum\u2019, argued that the \u2018submerged tenth\u2019 still existed in\ntowns. Yet the reviewer warmly recommended the survey to readers, stating\nthat this was \u2018an honest and courageous book, which all those concerned with\nthe shaping of post-war social and educational policy will neglect at their\nperil \u2019.\"!# Apart from the review, the journal also referred to the book in an\neditorial. It argued that the condition of the evacuees was not the fault of the\nchildren or of their parents, but reflected the environment they lived in, and\nagreed the book was a \u2018social document of the first importance\u2019. It welcomed\nthe proposals that included more nursery schools, smaller classes, and improved\nrecruitment and training of teachers. But it noted that the book\u2019s recom-\nmendations coincided with plans for post-war reconstruction, and agreed that\nchanges should also embrace full employment, family allowances, a national\nhealth service, and price controls, arguing that \u2018poverty and ignorance must be\nattacked from many angles ; side by side with the campaign for better\neducation must go one for better material conditions \u2019.\"!$\nPerhaps newspapers rather than journals provide a better guide to the\nimpact and influence of the Our towns report. The review in The Times, for\nexample, was published on 29 March 1943, while most of the reviews in\njournals came later, in April and May. In some respects, the paper did stress the\npoor condition and behaviour of the evacuees, it focused on the \u2018submerged\n** \u2018An urban close-up\u2019, Lancet, p. 631. \"!! \u2018Our social evils \u2019, Medical Officer, p. 106.\n\"!\" \u2018Our towns\u2019, Medical Officer, 70 (1943), pp. 115\u201316.\n\"!# \u2018Life in the urban slum: a grave social indictment \u2019, Times Educational Supplement, 1457 (3 Apr.\n1943), p. 158.\n\"!$ \u2018Social failure \u2019, Times Educational Supplement, 1457 (3 Apr. 1943), p. 163.\nthe OUR TOWNS report of 1943 803\ntenth\u2019, and it thought the problem was as much one of education as of\nenvironment. However, it did argue that the report should be read by all social\nreformers, and also devoted a leader article to this subject.\"!% This linked the\nreport to the charter for child welfare that had been advocated by Herbert\nMorrison in the Beveridge debate, and mentioned in Churchill\u2019s recent radio\nbroadcast on post-war reconstruction. Headed \u2018A charter for childhood\u2019, the\nleader suggested that the wartime milk scheme, expansion of school meals,\nwartime nurseries, and the Beveridge Report offered a platform for long-term\nreform. In the meantime, the immediate priorities were to abolish poverty in\nlarge families through family allowances and other welfare benefits, to provide\nmedical services to children from birth to school-leaving age, and to eliminate\nthe \u2018slum mind\u2019 through the provision of nursery classes. Like Our towns, it was\na curious mixture, noting that \u2018unsatisfactory material circumstances \u2013\npoverty, out-of-date, insanitary and overcrowded housing, inadequate water\nsupply, dirt, and noise \u2013 make up the background which produces the problem\nmother and the problem child\u2019.\"!&\nThe question remains of how far, and in what ways, the Our towns survey\ninfluenced political debate. Some hints were provided in the course of a House\nof Lords debate on \u2018positive health\u2019 in May 1943, when the report was\nmentioned by several participants. As with the reviews, the comments of some\nindicated that the report, and evacuation in general, had simply served to\nconfirm a particular interpretation of poverty. Lord Geddes, a former president\nof the local government board and minister of reconstruction, claimed that\nwhile he had been impressed by the physical condition of the evacuees, the most\nstriking feature was their \u2018 listlessness \u2019. He thought that around 10 per cent fell\ninto this category \u2013 the mothers were \u2018cultural orphans \u2019 who could not do\nanything for themselves, while the children were like \u2018untrained puppies or\nuntrained kittens \u2019.\"!\u2019 Other participants in the debate agreed with this\ninterpretation. Cosmo Lang, archbishop of Canterbury 1928\u201342, argued that\nthe children were not in a bad condition because of low living standards, but\nowing to \u2018the heedlessness, the shiftlessness, the carelessness and the ignorance\nof their mothers \u2019. Thus the solutions were better homes and the training of girls\nin motherhood: \u2018while there is urgent need of the rebuilding of better houses,\nthere is almost equal need of rebuilding the broken family life of the country\u2019.\"!(\nBut as with the journals, other participants voiced different concerns, both\nin their assessment of the Our towns report, and of evacuation in general. Lord\nLatham, leader of the LCC, noted that before the evacuation many people had\nbeen unaware of urban poverty, and that the survey had revealed \u2018the terrible\nand indeed terrifying conditions which exist in towns\u2019. While he accepted that\nthe condition of the evacuees was poor, he claimed that these problems could\n\"!% \u2018Slum life in cities \u2019, Times, 29 Mar. 1943, p. 5.\n\"!& \u2018A charter for childhood\u2019, Times, 29 Mar. 1943, p. 5.\n\"!\u2019 House of Lords debates 1942\u20133, 5th series, cxxvii, cols. 365\u201377.\n\"!( Ibid., cols. 383\u20136.\n804 john welshman\nnot be solved by education alone.

In some respects, the comments of Cyril Garbett, archbishop of\nYork, indicated that he agreed with the report\u2019s emphasis on nursery schools.\nYet on the other hand, he argued that Our towns was a \u2018most valuable social\ndocument of the very first importance\u2019, and noted that efforts to improve\nhealth should also tackle environmental and housing conditions.\"!* And\nalthough Lord Snell, Labour MP for East Woolwich 1922\u201331 and deputy\nleader of the Lords, argued that health services had improved, he admitted\nthey were \u2018piece-meal and restricted in scope\u2019. Medical insurance extended\nonly to the insured and not to their families, the co-ordination of services was\npoor, and voluntary and municipal hospitals had evolved in a haphazard\nmanner. Snell concluded that an opportunity existed for fundamental social\nchange, and the aim should be \u2018to establish a foundation on which a healthier\nand happier Britain may be built \u2019.\"\"!\nIf the Our towns report was mentioned in the course of political debates, it was\nalso quoted in some of the major policy documents produced in this crucial\nperiod of the Second World War. The White Paper on educational re-\nconstruction, for instance, published in July 1943, claimed that its main finding\nwas the need for nursery schools in the poorest parts of large cities. There was\nno doubt, it said, of the importance of training children in good habits at the\nmost impressionable age, and of the nursery school\u2019s value in influencing\nparents. At the same time, the White Paper suggested that schoolchildren\nshould be treated through the new National Health Service, legislation on\nschool meals and milk should be compulsory rather than permissive, local\nauthorities should provide boots and clothing, and provision for \u2018handicapped\u2019\nchildren would have to be substantially improved.\"\"\" The hygiene sub-\ncommittee certainly felt that the survey had had an important influence on\ncivil servants in the key central departments. In September 1947, for instance,\nit claimed from interviews with civil servants that \u2018 in the Government\nDepartments the copies were much thumbed and blue-pencilled and were\nobviously in fairly frequent use \u2019.\"\"#\nWhat impact, if any, did Our towns have on the NCSS? It attempted to\ncontinue the work of the NECC with its plans to encourage the building of\ncommunity centres on new housing estates. Interestingly, some of these\npamphlets both reflected the emphasis that was still placed on education, but\nalso the new stress on the dangers of \u2018problem families \u2019.\"\"$ Hilda Jennings,\nauthor of the famous social survey of Brynmawr (1934), wrote that Our towns,\n\"!)

This anticipated the\ncreation of local authority children\u2019s departments following the 1948 Children\nAct. At the same time, it echoed the issue of the \u2018problem family\u2019 raised in Our\ntowns, arguing that the defining characteristic of these families was \u2018not so\nmuch the poorness and drabness of their surroundings but their apathy and\nindifference to their squalor and filth\u2019.\"\"& The report recommended that advice\non birth control should be particularly targeted at \u2018problem families \u2019 as part of\npublic health services. Overall, it was not surprising that in the 1950s, much of\nthe work of both the NCSS and the Women\u2019s Group on Public Welfare focused\non homemaking groups.\nSome of these events preceded Problems of social policy, since publication of the\nofficial history was delayed until 1950. Here Titmuss drew directly on Our towns\nin his exploration of such issues as footwear and clothing, bedwetting, the\nincidence of head lice, and the cultural life of mothers of the evacuated\nchildren. In what ways, therefore, was Titmuss influenced by the survey, and\nto what extent did he share the ideas of its authors? Of course, Titmuss\u2019s book\nwas written partly to consolidate support for the emerging welfare state, and\nOur towns was only one of many sources. But he did use its findings to confirm\nthat parents could be neglectful, as in the allegations that children were \u2018 sewn\nup\u2019 for the winter, and that swearing began at an early age.\"\"\u2019 He argued that\nin broken homes, children became \u2018unstable, aggressive, lazy, cynical and\nuntrustworthy\u2019, and noted of bedwetting that \u2018 slum mores are consistent with\na slum home\u2019.\"\"( Writing of the mothers of the evacuees, Titmuss claimed that\n\u2018corrupt manners naturally provoke censure, but they are usually the product\nof a corrupting environment\u2019.\"\") And Titmuss did use the phrases \u2018 social\nproblem group\u2019 and \u2018problem families \u2019, claiming that perhaps 2 to 5 per cent\nof the evacuees fell into these categories. Given this background, the famous\nsentence \u2018the louse is not a political creature ; it cannot distinguish between the\nsalt of the earth and the scum of the earth\u2019 can be read in several different\nways.\"\"* In many respects, Titmuss shared the ambivalent approach taken by\nthe authors of Our towns \u2013 undoubtedly passionately committed to the welfare\nstate, he also remained interested in behavioural interpretations of poverty into\nthe 1960s.\nThe impact of the Our towns report was, of course, intimately bound up with\nthe timing of its publication.

D. H. Cole\u2019s Social\nSecurity League all followed on quickly in February and March.\"#! Important\nreports were appearing by April, among them the report National service for\nhealth, published by the Labour party\u2019s reconstruction committee on health\nservices. This, then, was the wider context for the appearance of the Our towns\nreport \u2013 the most fruitful period for social reform in the entire wartime period.\nWhat is not in doubt is that, whether accidental or intentional, the report\ncoincided with the turning point in the acceptance of the Beveridge report and\nthe initial moves in the trend that was to become the tide for post-war\nreconstruction. It was the timing of its publication that explained the reaction\nto the report, and Our towns both reflected and quickened the movement for\nsocial reform.\nV\nIt is clear that the Our towns report offers important insights into ideas on social\nquestions in this key period of the Second World War. These include the\nimpact of evacuation, the evolution of the \u2018problem family\u2019, the anatomy of\nreconstruction, and the nature of voluntarism in the 1940s. Certainly, members\nof the hygiene sub-committee such as Amy Sayle, Irene Barclay, and Elizabeth\nDenby did bear the imprint of their earlier experiences in other organizations,\nand the influence of interwar debates about poverty, housing, and citizenship.\nThese included the movement for housing management that had initially been\nlinked with Octavia Hill, the earlier attempts of the NCSS and NECC to\ncivilize the inhabitants of large housing estates through community centres,\nother housing projects that aimed to cultivate citizenship, and the efforts of\nsuch bodies as the Nursery Schools Association. An analysis of social questions\ngrew up that was imbued by the traditional emphasis on the fecklessness of the\nworking class, drew freely on eugenic concepts and language, and was\nessentially a behavioural interpretation of social problems.\nHowever, it is also the case that, in the peculiar circumstances of the early\n1940s, a different kind of approach to social problems was grafted on to this\nanalysis in such bodies as the Women\u2019s Group on Public Welfare. Though the\nmembers of the hygiene sub-committee had less direct experience of the groups\nthat had campaigned in the 1930s on such matters as child poverty,\nmalnutrition, and housing, this again echoed earlier debates of the interwar\nyears. The experience of the evacuation had served to illustrate that child\npoverty still existed in cities, and exposed the complacency and inaccuracy of\nmany official reports. Moreover, this interpretation placed greater emphasis on\nthe deficiencies inherent in existing health and welfare services, located poverty\nin the wider context of other environmental issues, and stressed the\n\"#!

This more overtly\npolitical stance was reflected in the comments and writings of Margaret\nBondfield, and meant that the deliberations behind the survey had a particular\nresonance in the debates about post-war reconstruction.\nBut perhaps the most useful aspect of the Our towns report lies in the way it\ndemonstrates how the binary opposition of \u2018reactionary\u2019 and \u2018radical \u2019 is\nmisplaced and anachronistic, and ultimately an unhelpful way of viewing\nsocial policy in the 1940s. There clearly were tensions between individual\nmembers of the hygiene sub-committee, and differences of opinion that\nemerged in the drafting process. But it was also the case that they were able to\nadopt an analysis of social problems that had both behavioural and\nenvironmental components, and produced recommendations that included\neducation alongside other aspects of social reform. Thus the report advocated\nnursery schools but also family allowances, and recommended an inquiry into\n\u2018problem families \u2019 at the same time as an expansion of school meals. Here it\nreflected changes in the eugenics movement in the 1930s, where the\nappointment of Hogben at the London School of Economics had signalled a\ngreater emphasis on social biology. In the end, it was this Janus-faced\ncharacter of the report that explains its powerful appeal in the unusual\ncircumstances of the spring of 1943. Our towns certainly had a reassuring\nfamiliarity in the way that it located social problems in the context of\nindividual behaviour, and looked back to the interwar debates about\ncitizenship. However, the survey also reflected the movement for social\nreconstruction, and provided a glimpse of the ideas that would shape the\nwelfare state in the post-war years.\n"}
