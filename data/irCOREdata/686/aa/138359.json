Current businesses are not just competing on price, quality or\nservice, but on other dimensions that did not exist two decades ago. To cope with\ncustomers\u2019 demands, organisations are re-defining their value offers and joining\ncollaborative efforts with suppliers to create distinctive competitive advantages. Hence,\nmanaging value on supply chains has become critical for survival and growth of\norganisations.\nDespite the plethora of studies on value that have been undertaken to date, our\nexploratory analysis found that organisations are still failing to identify their value\npropositions, particularly in aligning their resources and capabilities with their value\ncreation processes in their supply chains. Hence, the aim of this paper is to analyse the\nvalue creation processes in supply chains. In particular, to understand the value\npropositions of different members of the supply chain and their alignment within the\noverall value proposition of the supply chain.\nThe second section of this paper focuses on the study of relevant literature on value. The\nthird section introduces the value matrix, a framework containing six generic value\npropositions. The fourth section discusses the methodology used to carry out the case\nstudy. The fifth section discusses the role of the value propositions on the value creation\nin supply chains in the context of the case study. The sixth section focuses on the analysis\nof the case study results. Finally, the paper finishes with conclusions and an agenda for\nfurther research.\n2. Origins and evolution of the theory of value\nIt is a general belief that the debate on value dates from the Greek times with the theory\nof exchange from Aristotle in the 4th century BC, then Socrates\u2019 followers introduced a\nnew view of value based on utility (Table 1). The Greek era was followed by the pre-\nclassical era with writers like Petty (1623-1687), Cantillon (1734), Galiani (1728-1787)\nand Law (1671-1729) introducing the factors of production, which founded the labour\ntheory. In 1723, Adam Smith initiated \u201cthe classical era\u201d together with Ricardo (1772-\n1823), Mills (1806-1873) and Marx (1818-1883). They provided a new dimension to\nvalue by the introduction of labour cost and cost of production. It is at this point that\nMarx developed the original rate of exploitation and its resulting critique of capitalism.\nThe neo-classical era was led by Jvons (1835-1882), Menger (1840-1921), Walras (1834-\n1910) and Marshall (1842-1924) and they focused on the utility the buyer expects to\nreceive and the cost of production (Fogarty, 1996).\nTable 1 shows that the literature on value dates back to the 4th century BC, \u2018the Greek\n\u00e9poque\u2019, nevertheless value has become more popular in the last two centuries. Theories\nfrom the 1800\u2019s have been adopted by different fields. For instance, the theory from John\nStuart Mill (1806-1873), which focuses on the labour theory of demand-supply,\ninfluenced the strategy theories, in particular the value chain and value activities\nproposed by various authors such as Porter (1985). Another theory adopted is the\nmarginal utility theory from William Jevon (1835-1882) and Carl Manger (1840-1921),\nwhich focuses on the utility the buyer expects to receive. This influenced different\ntheories of strategy and marketing; i.e. the relationship in transaction, the perceived\nvalue-sacrifice, the consumer behaviour and value delivery sequence (Crosby et al, 1990;\nSheth et al, 1991; Bower and Garda, 1985).\nNowadays, the value delivery sequence, which is always referred as \u201cthe value\nproposition\u201d, was originated by McKinsey & Co\u2019s research group (Bower and\nGarda,1985). This emphasises the need to change from the traditional functional view of\nactivities to an externally oriented view as a form of value delivery.\nThe value proposition, popularised by Tracy and Wiersema (1993), is defined as an\nimplicit promise a company makes to customers to deliver a particular combination of\nvalues. Each proposition searches for the unique value that can be delivered to a chosen\nmarket. The theory behind value propositions is the creation of mutual value for customer\nand supplier. It can be achieved as a consequence of a reciprocal relationship between\norganisations and stakeholders in a network or constellation (Ramirez, 1999).\nThe value propositions directly impact business\u2019 strategies; e.g. they impact the market\nwhere businesses are competing, the acquisition and development of core competencies\nand capabilities, selection of members of the supply chain and the financial priorities. The\nvalue propositions also impact operations, e.g. market research, new product\ndevelopment, supplier relationships, production processes, customers\u2019 relationship and\ndelivery systems. In other words the value propositions shape any subsequent plan and\ndecision that companies make. Hence, the concept of value proposition is of increasing\ninterest to both academics and practitioners from different fields particularly from\noperations, supply chain, strategy and performance management points of views.\n[TABLE 1: The origins of value and their evolution]\n3. The six value propositions of the value matrix\nThe value matrix was born from the three value propositions of Treacy and Wiersema\n(1996), i.e. product leaders, operational excellence and customer intimacy with the\naddition of the hard and soft value dimensions (Martinez and Bititci, 2000). The result of\nthis combination is a two by three matrix with six value propositions: innovators, brand\nmanagers, price minimisers, simplifiers, technological integrators and socialisors.\nThe six value propositions of the value matrix align the key operational elements that the\ncompany has to build to offer a particular type of value that fulfils the customers\u2019\nexpectations of a specific market segment (Figure 1).\n[FIGURE 1: The value matrix]\nA more comprehensive explanation of the six value propositions of the Value Matrix are\nexplained from two different perspectives: customer perspective \u201cWhat customers get\u201d\nand business perspective as \u201cWhat the company needs to do\u201d (Martinez and Bititci,\n2001).\n3.1 Innovators (I)\nIn this case the customers get new products, which they have never seen before, with\nunique and special characteristics. These type of companies need to focus on building\nstrong design skills, work within short product lifecycles, make obsolete their own\nproducts and continuously introduce new products. The strategic objective of \u2018innovators\u2019\nis to provide breakthrough through new designs and product generations within\ntechnological basis.\n3.2 Brand managers (BM)\nBrand managers\u2019 customers get status by the product acquisition to feed some feelings,\nsuch as superiority, ego and social acceptance among others. Hence, the value that these\norganisations proposes is a mix of physical attributes of the product, brand, service and\neven price; because, sometimes the price is considered as an attribute to the product\nespecially for brand mangers. The strategic objective of \u2018brand managers\u2019 is to expand\nthe market reinforcing the solid brand image of the product and\/or company.\n3.3. Price minimisers (PM)\nPrice minimisers\u2019 customers get good quality, reliable and conscious price products. In\norder to sustain this proposition, these organisations need to focus on the development of\nstrong capabilities to reduce lead times, reduce costs and waste and optimise process\nperformance. Their strategic objective is focused on making their production process\nefficient and driving down operational costs.\n3.4 Simplifiers (Si)\nSimplifiers\u2019 customers get availability and convenience to reach the products. In order to\nsupport this proposition, these organisations have to have strong focus and automation on\norder generation and order fulfilment to take out the hassle from customers. Their\nstrategic objective is focused on building streamlined processes to make life simple and\nuncomplicated for customers in a creative, novel and profitable way.\n3.5 Technological Integrators (TI)\nTechnological integrators\u2019 customers get total solutions, i.e. tailored products and\nservices. In order to support this proposition, these organisations need to support their\ncustomers\u2019 processes, helping them to identify and provide new solutions; hence,\npersonalised attention such as product delivery, pre- and post-purchasing service,\ninstallation and maintenance, are some of the attributes of their product\/service. The\nstrategic objective of \u2018technological integrators\u2019 is to customise specific and continuous\nsolutions for carefully selected customers on the basis of long term relationships.\n3.6 Socialisors (So)\nSocialisors\u2019 customers get flexible and reliable services. In order to sustain this\nproposition, these organisations build capabilities of strong service delivery and long\nrelationships with customers. Their strategic objective is focused on building confidence\nand trust through the service provided. Perhaps their products are not innovative, low\nprice, tailored products, but the type of product and its delivery to their customers build a\nfeeling of confidence of dealing with them. For instance, Socialisors build confidence by\ncontinuous interaction with the customer\u2019s business or supporting anytime their\ncustomers require them.\n3.7 Unit of analysis\nThe value propositions of the value matrix can be applied to the whole organisation or to\nbusiness units. However, our empirical research supports that it is more appropriate to\napply the value propositions at business unit level (Martinez, 2003). Especially when an\norganisation has two or more business units with:\n\uf0b7 different strategic positions\n\uf0b7 are serving different market segments with different competitive requirements\n\uf0b7 have different product strategies\n\uf0b7 have significant operational differences\n\uf0b7 their images are perceived differently by their markets.\n4. Methodology\nIn the study of value creation in supply chains, it is important to go to the fundamental\npoint where value is created to understand how it is created. This research issue demands\nan in-depth understanding of the value generated by each member of the supply chain. In\ndoing so, the social constructivism paradigm provides us with a high degree of interaction\nwith and involvement in the research issue and its environment. This allows the\nresearchers to get access to different data sources and tacit information, which has the\npotential to inject new insight into the research (Voss et al., 2002; Easterby-Smith, 1999).\nFor this reason a case study methodology has been adopted because case studies tend to\nbe more descriptive and provide richer and deeper contextual data by using a wide variety\nof data collection tools (Yin 2000; Thietart et al, 2001).\n4.1 Application of the in-depth case study\nAn in-depth case study was conducted on the supply chain of a company operating in the\nfashion industry. Data was collected through visits and meetings over a period of two\nmonths supported by semi-structured interviews, structured questionnaires and\nobservations as well as studying a range of companies\u2019 documentation.\n5. Case of study\nDaks Simpson is an apparel manufacturer specialising in ladies and gents suits, jackets\nand trousers. Its products are sold in a global market with a significant presence in\nEurope and the Far-East.\nDaks has two business units (BU), these are:\n\uf0b7 Daks BU designs, manufactures and sells apparels under the Daks label. Daks\u2019\nproducts, which are linked to a classic and elegant British heritage, are tailored\nand produced to high specifications in limited quantities. Usually, a gents; suit\nmay sell at \u00a3400 - \u00a3600 in one of Daks\u2019 stores or through one of their retailers\nsuch as Harrods in the UK and Nordstrom in the US. These products compete\nwith prestigious designers\u2019 houses such as Chanel, Armani, Prada, etc.\n\uf0b7 Contract BU designs, manufactures and sells apparels under either customers\u2019\nown label, or for corporate wear under a customers name, such as Bank of\nScotland. Compared with the garments produced for the Daks BU, these are\nsimpler and cheaper. These products compete with other similar commodity\nproducts.\nEach business unit operates a different supply chain. From now on, the supply chain of\nDaks BU is called \u2018Daks SC\u2019 and the Contract BU is called \u2018Contract SC\u2019.\nDaks SC is characterised by its high product variety and low production volumes. Its\ndesign flexibility is high; i.e. every six months Daks SC launches a complete new\ncollectioni. For this reason, it has frequent changes to its schedule. In contrast, the\nContract SC is characterised by its low product variety and large production volumes. Its\ndesign flexibility is very limited because its products have minor modifications to\nexisting designs; therefore, the changes to schedule are low (Table2).\n[TABLE 2: Comparison of Daks and Contract\u2019s supply chains]\nFigures 2 and 3 illustrate both supply chains. It is clear that Contract SC is simpler than\nDaks SC. Daks SC has close communication and coordination with some suppliers, such\nas Arthur Bell, B&L and London Badges, on the design of new materials (cloths, buttons\nand yarns). The discussion on the development of a new material takes up to four months\nbefore the material is accepted (Figure 2). In contrast, the relationship of Daks SC with\nother suppliers, such as Botto, is limited to a buying and selling transaction. The Contract\nSC does not design new cloths or apparels; it merely makes use of existing capabilities to\nproduce commodity products at sensible prices (Figure 3).\n[FIGURE 2: Daks supply chain]\n[FIGURE3: Contract supply chain]\n5.1 Analysis of value creation\nAn individual analysis of the creation of value was carried out for each supply chain. In\ndoing so, the value propositions of the value matrix, previously discussed, were used to\nunderstand and identify the value proposition of each company in the supply chain. The\nvalue propositions are shown on the right hand corner of each supply chain member in\nFigures 2 and 3.\nThe overall value proposition of the Contract SC shows a consistent pattern of value\ncreation following a price minimiser\u2019s strategy (Figure 3). The competencies and\ncapabilities of the members of this supply chain, from yarn\u2019s suppliers to retailers, are\naligned to minimise costs through lead time reduction, process standardisation and\nemphasis on quality control. The value proposition to customers is every day quality\napparels at sensible prices.\nThe value creation process of Daks SC is more complex, it has a mix of value\npropositions from individual members of the supply chain (Figure 2). Hence, it is\nanalysed on parts; i.e. the supply chain of cloth shows B&L is a Price Minimiser. B&L\nspins and dyes yarns for Arthur Bell; it creates value through the mass production of\nyarns. Then, Arthur Bell, which is an Innovator, works in close collaboration with Daks\nBU on the design of new cloths: combining yarns with style, colours, finishes, etc. A new\ncloth design process takes up to four months; logically it raises the materials costs. Then\nthe cloth is supplied to Daks BU. Daks BU which is a Brand Manager, focuses on the\ndesign and creation of exclusive apparels. It manufactures high variety of apparels on low\nvolume basis. Once the apparel is manufactured, it sold through retail outlets who are\nalso Brand Managers.\nDaks SC speeds up its production process by buying already designed cloths from Botto,\nwhich is an Italian Brand Manger. For buttons, Daks SC has two suppliers; these are\nStern and London Badge. London Badge which follows a Technological Integrator\u2019s\nstrategy customises buttons for Daks\u2019 exclusive apparels. The design of these buttons is\ndeveloped by Daks BU with the help and expertise of London Badge. These expensive\nbuttons are used for the external part of the apparels. Meanwhile, Stern which follows a\nPrice Minimiser\u2019s strategy provides simple and cheap buttons to Daks BU. These buttons\nare used for the internal part of the apparels. Differently from London Badge, Stern is not\na strategic member of Daks SC because it does not hold core capabilities or core products\nin Daks SC.\nThe trousers are also non-core products in Daks SC; therefore, the manufacturing\nfacilities are economically outsourced from a supplier that operates a Price Minimiser\u2019s\nstrategy.\n6. Discussions and conclusions\nThis research illustrated how the value matrix could be used to model and better\nunderstand value creation process along the supply chain. The value matrix through its\nsix value propositions provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how\ndifferent organisations within a supply chain create value. Two supply chains were\nanalysed and compared. Their value analysis showed that each supply chain has different\nvalue creation processes. The Contract SC follows a Price Minimiser value proposition;\nwhereas, Daks SC follows a Brand Manager\u2019s value proposition.\nThe Contract SC has strong alignment of competencies and capabilities focused on cost\nreduction and optimisation of processes. Design flexibility is very limited, therefore, the\ncollaboration and coordination of supply chain members is mainly focused on order\nfulfilment. All supply chain members follow the same value proposition; consequently\nthere is not any operational or strategic conflict between members (Figure 4).\n[FIGURE 4: The value propositions of the Contract SC]\nThe overall value proposition of Daks SC is Brand Manager. It focuses on the design and\ndevelopment of exclusive products and on the exploitation of its brand name. This supply\nchain provides an interesting process of value creation because, in contrast to the\nContract SC, its members follow different value strategies (Figure 5). The core\ncompetencies of the Daks SC are held by key members (strategic members), which share\nthe same value propositions \u2018Brand Managers\u2019 as Daks SC. Other non-core capabilities\nare acquired from other members, which have different value propositions. These support\nthe overall SC value proposition by optimising costs, delivery times and reducing risks on\nuncomplicated and non-core products.\n[FIGURE 5: The value proposition of the Daks SC]\nFigure 5 shows the value propositions of Daks SC\u2019s members in the value matrix. It\nanalyses the strategic and operational alignments of value between members. This\nanalysis helps to identify complementary capabilities or conflicts. An interesting case is\nthe relationship between Daks BU (Brand Manager) and Stern (Price Minimiser). Stern\nprovides ordinary buttons at sensible prices; these are used for the internal part of Daks\u2019\napparels. At the strategic level, Stern supports Daks BU by reducing cost of apparels. At\nthe operational level, someone might argue that frequent changes of Daks BU\u2019s\nproduction schedule might effect Stern\u2019s production schedule. Nevertheless, the nature of\nStern\u2019s products (simple products and produce on high volumes) and its production\nprocess (make to stock) reduces the operational conflict between these members.\nTherefore, there is no operational problem to collaborate. Concluding, Daks BU and\nStern\u2019s capabilities are aligned and are complementary, and the operational conflict is\nmoderated.\nA similar analysis was carried out for Daks BU (Brand Manager) and London Badge\n(Technological Integrator) (Figure 5). At the strategic level, London Badge\u2019s capabilities\nare complementary with the Daks\u2019 ones because the tailored buttons from London Badge\nenhance the exclusive designs of Daks BU. At the operational level, London Badge\u2019s\nproduct design and production schedule totally depend on Daks BU\u2019s needs. In\nconclusion, their strategic and operational capabilities are aligned, and do not have any\noperational conflict.\nThe combinations of value propositions, strategic competencies and capabilities from\ndifferent members create a unique value creation process for Daks SC.\nFrom these cases we can conclude that:\n1. Strategic\/key members of the supply chain are those who hold the core\ncompetencies of the chain.\n2. The value propositions of strategic members of the supply chain should be aligned\nto enhance the value proposition of the entire supply chain.\n3. Other members which are not strategic members of the supply chain can have\ndifferent value propositions, but should support the value proposition of the\noverall supply chain.\n4. The value proposition of strategic members of the supply chain dictate the value\nproposition of the overall supply chain.\n5. The value proposition of the overall supply chain is the same as that of the\ncompany that is facing the end customer (Bititci et al, 2004).\n6. The alignment of individual value propositions with the overall supply chain\nensures the alignment of strategic competencies.\n7. The collaboration with strategic members is focused on the improvement of the\nsupply chain competencies.\nThis research initiated the conversation on the analysis of value creation on supply\nchains, by studying the value propositions of individual members. It provides initial\ninsights on the integration and alignment of individual values and strategic competencies.\nIt is particularly relevant to practitioners for changing how organisations design and\noperate supply chains.\nThis research proposes a value chain tool kit (Figure 6); a framework for the analysis of\nvalue creation on supply chains. The first three steps of this tool kit are focused on the\nidentification of members of the supply chain (SC), its current competencies and\ncapabilities and its value propositions. To identify the value propositions of SC members\nthe six value propositions of the value matrix are used (see Section 3). The fourth to\nseventh step are focused on the value creation analysis. I.e. the value propositions from\nSC members are mapped to the value matrix, similarly as Figure 4 and 5. It is followed\nby the analysis of alignment and misalignments of the competencies and value\npropositions of SC members. Here, it is important to analyse alignments\/misalignments at\nthe strategic and operational levels. Thus, the gaps in competencies and problems are\nemerged (shown). Finally, the value analysis finishes with the development of a road map\nto solve or minimise problems associated with misalignments.\n[FIGURE 6: Value chain tool kit: a framework for the analysis of value creation on\nsupply chains]\nThis research also highlighted a number of research issues. The first issue is based on the\nlimitation of this empirical study, i.e. single industrial sector with two case studies.\nRicher insights could be drawn from more cases on different industrial sectors. A second\nissue for future research is to study the relationship between the types of value produced\nbetween members. The third issue for future research is to study who and how the overall\nvalue proposition of the supply chain is defined. Some supply chain theories support that\nthe strongest member of the supply chain dictates the direction and value proposition.\nWhereas, some other studies argue that the last member of the supply chain which faces\nthe end customers dictates the direction the supply chain strategy (Bititci et al, 2004).\nResearch on these issues could help organisations to improve understanding and optimise\nthe value creation process in supply chains, especially for those organisations that are\nbuilding a new supply chain.\n8.
