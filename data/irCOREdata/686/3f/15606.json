INTRODUCTION \nWeb sites are a particularly transient type of digital resource: the \naverage lifespan of a Web page in 2003 was deemed to be 100 \ndays and it is not unreasonable to suggest that it is even shorter \ntoday [1]. Several 'solutions' to preserve Web sites have been \ndeveloped, many of which are library- or community-based. \nWhilst extremely valuable in their own right, they cannot and do \nnot affect Web sites at the point of production and in their 'active' \nlife. Proper management of Web-based records during the active \nphase of their life-cycle is vital if authenticity and integrity is to \nbe assured at a later date. In effect, efforts must be expended to \nensure Web sites are 'future-proof' [2]. This paper addresses an \nalternative and selective approach to preserving Web-based \nmaterials based on records management principles, whereby the \npreservation and record-keeping requirements of institutions, \norganisations, and archives are fundamental and impact day-to-\nday management of the live data. \n2.  IMPORTANCE OF WEB SITE \nARCHIVING & PRESERVATION \nToday's Internet reflects the developments and achievements of \nmodern society. The Internet has fostered a change in the social \nstructure of society, enabling a truly global network to develop, \nand has broadened access to materials in a fashion not \nexperienced since the creation of the printing press. Its cultural \nand historical value therefore necessitates its preservation. \nFurthermore, resources published on the Internet constitute a \ndirect communication between originating organisations and their \naudience. For organisational Web sites, such as government, \ninstitutional, and private businesses, such resources may have \ntransactional, evidential, and record-keeping value. The proper \narchiving and preservation of these resources, as well as the \ncontextual information surrounding them, is particularly \nimportant when the Internet is the only medium through which the \nmessage is communicated. Web sites and reliable information \nabout Web-based resources thus hold value over time for multiple \nreasons and must be managed in a manner appropriate to their \nretention. \n3.  CURRENT APPROACHES \nMost current models for Web site preservation originate from \nlibraries. They often utilise a harvesting approach, whereby robots \ncrawl the Web copying content and metadata about resources they \nencounter across a particular domain. The Internet Archive \nfollows this harvesting model and attempts to collect and archive \nthe entire Internet. Collections may also be selective or thematic, \naccording to the requirements or remit of the collecting \norganisation. The Swedish Kulturawr3 project to preserve Web \nsites of particular relevance to Sweden works in this way. \nAlternatively, robots may be released on a more subjective or \nrestrictive basis, with instructions only to copy certain sets of \nWeb sites that have already been identified by the collecting \norganisation as Web sites of interest. This is particularly the case \nwhere copyright or permission to archive must first be sought, as \nis the case with the PANDAS software of the National Library of \nAustralia (NLA) and the UK Web Archiving Consortium \n(UKWAC) [3]. Unlike other similar initiatives, UKWAC \nunusually benefits from the participation of non-library \norganisations, broadening expertise and sharing practical \nexperience across different sectors.  \nSome countries rely not upon automated harvest but upon deposit \nof materials, and electronic legal deposit legislation is slowly \ntaking shape in Europe that reflects the ongoing value of online \ndigital resources, especially those published in electronic form \nonly. Such deposit is already compulsory in Sweden, whilst the \nCopyright is held by the author\/owner(s). \nWWW 2006, May 23\u201326, 2006, Edinburgh, Scotland. \nACM 1-59593-323-9\/06\/0005. \n National Library of the Netherlands has negotiated voluntary \ndeposit agreements with publishers.  \n4.  RECORDS MANAGEMENT \nPERSPECTIVE \nRecords are evidence of business and administrative transactions \nand are essential resources for accountability and organizational \nmemory. The content of these records can determine the acts of \nthe users who access them. The rise of electronic government, e-\ncommerce, and general use of Web sites to communicate official \nordinances has resulted in an increasing number of records \nexisting solely online, and being published only in that form. \nTraditional paper-based record-keeping infrastructures commonly \nfail to identify, control, and capture records published in \nelectronic format, particularly when responsibility for creation, \ncontrol, dissemination and maintenance of records is widely \ndistributed.  This is a problem because records must meet certain \nrequirements in order to qualify as evidence.  \nApplication of records management principles to Web site \nmaintenance ensures that records published on the site are \ncontrolled and can meet the requirements for organisational \naccountability. The starting point is that not all data needs to be \nretained: the basic premise of records management is that it is \nneither necessary nor desirable to retain everything. The first step \nin implementing proper records management for Web-based \nrecords is therefore to identify that which should be preserved and \nfor how long, against that which should be destroyed. Ignoring \nthis principle results in the capture of ephemeral, redundant, or \nincorrect material alongside (or instead of) permanently valuable \nand transactional records, which may adversely impact the entire \nrecords management strategy.  \nRetention periods specify the length of time information must be \nretained. Different categories of information have differing \nretention periods. Legal ordinances may impact upon retention \nperiods, particularly the Data Protection Act and the Freedom of \nInformation Act. Records management guidelines and retention \nperiods must be applied to Web-based data to ensure that such \nlegal obligations are met, for records posted on both the Internet \nand Intranets.  \nInformation posted to Web sites is frequently updated on a casual \nbasis, with no permanent records kept of changes that were made \n- such as error correction, date of creation, date of posting, date of \ndeletion, and author. Whilst frequent updates and corrections are \nuseful features of Web-based materials, they can cause confusion \nand lead to errors or misunderstanding by users if such changes \nare not recorded. Measures should therefore be taken to ensure \nthat identified records are a) retained, b) unchanged, and c) \nauthentic and their integrity assured. This can only be reliably \nachieved if control is exercised over the entire life-cycle of the \nrecords, i.e. from creation through to publication, archiving, \npreservation and possible eventual destruction. Failure to do so \nimpacts upon the perceived value of the records, their reliability, \nand their legal status. A clear and institutionally embedded policy \non Web site management and the relationship between Web-based \nmaterials and records management helps ensure conformance and \nthus high-quality records. \n4.1  Use Case Scenarios \nA simple example illustrating problems caused by frequent and \nnon-recorded data updates involves an ordinance specifying a \nsubmission date which incurs financial penalties if missed, for \nexample, from a Taxation Agency: if the date is incorrect and \nbrought forward, without maintaining a record of the error and \nseveral users subsequently incur financial penalties, an enquiry \ncould be launched that potentially damages public perception of \nthe organization and casts doubt on its accountability.  \nData Protection scenarios involve inappropriate information \nposted and available online, such as information that clearly \nidentifies personal circumstances of students. Freedom of \nInformation and Data Protection issues can also arise from, for \nexample, public enquiries and comments submitted via Web-\nforms that are stored in the Web-management system.  \nLegal discovery notices apply to records also hosted on Intranets; \nif unnecessary and potentially damaging documents are stored on \nthe Intranet that are not part of a records retention schedule and \nshould have been destroyed, the organization is liable to a whole \nrange of problems, depending on the context of the legal notice. \n5.  FURTHER WORK AND \nCONCLUSIONS \nThis short paper introduces the value and need for records \nmanagement principles in Web site management. In order to \nensure that the principles can be implemented, education, training, \nand collaboration between records creators, records managers, \nand records-hosting bodies is essential. Good practices for Web \nsite accessibility additionally contribute to the persistence of \nrecords hosted online: persistent identifiers, use of standards, \nembedded metadata that offers alternative mechanisms for \naccessing or understanding content, and log file maintenance. \nSystems that keep Web pages up-to-date and adhere to records \nmanagement and record-keeping principles, whilst retaining old \nand valuable records and metadata offline, limit liability, ensure \naccountability, and contribute towards future preservation \nactivities. Although this is a challenge to achieve with the \nincreasing complexity of dynamic Web based resources and \nremains the subject of further research, it is an absolute necessity \nfor a successful and accountable online presence. Within the UK, \nthe Digital Curation Centre (DCC) has been established and is \ndeveloping a tool for 'archiving databases', i.e. preserving past \nstates in an efficient form, that may prove useful for this purpose \n[4].  \n6.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThe authors acknowledge the contribution of Chris Rusbridge, \nDirector of the Digital Curation Centre. \n7.REFERENCES \n[1]  Weiss, R quoting Brewster Kahle, in On the Web, Research \nWork Proves Ephemeral Washington Post Nov 24 2003.  \n[2]  DCC\/Wellcome Library workshop, Future-Proofing Web \nsites http:\/\/www.dcc.ac.uk\/events\/fpw-2006\/  \n[3]  PANDAS\/PANDORA archive, \nhttp:\/\/www.kb.se\/kw3\/ENG\/Default.aspx \n[4]  Archiving Scientific Data, Buneman et al in ACM \nTransactions on Database Systems, Vol 27, 2004, 2-42.\n "}
