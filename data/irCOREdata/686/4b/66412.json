We apply this approach for calculating\ntree amplitudes of gauge fields and fermions and find agreement with known results. The\nformalism amounts to an effective scalar perturbation theory which offers a much simpler\nalternative to the usual Feynman diagrams in gauge theory and can be used for deriving\nnew simple expressions for tree amplitudes. At tree level the formalism works in a generic\ngauge theory, with or without supersymmetry, and for a finite number of colours.\n1 Introduction\nIn a recent paper [1] Witten outlined a construction which interprets perturbative ampli-\ntudes of conformal N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory as D-instanton contributions in\na topological string theory in twistor space. Motivated by this correspondence, Cachazo,\nSvrcek and Witten [2] proposed a remarkable new approach for calculating all tree-level\namplitudes of n gluons. In this approach tree amplitudes in a pure gauge theory are found\nby summing tree-level scalar Feynman diagrams with new vertices. The building blocks\nof this formalism are scalar propagators 1\/p2, and tree-level maximal helicity violating\n(MHV) amplitudes, which are interpreted as new scalar vertices. Using multi-particle am-\nplitudes as effective vertices enables one to save dramatically on a number of permutations\nin usual Feynman diagrams.\nThe new perturbation theory involves scalar diagrams since MHV vertices are scalar\nquantities. They are linked together by scalar propagators at tree-level, and the internal\nlines are continued off-shell in a particular fashion. The final result for any particular\namplitude can be shown to be Lorentz-covariant and is independent of a particular choice\nfor the off-shell continuation. The authors of [2] derived new expressions for a class of tree\namplitudes with three negative helicities and any number of positive ones. It has been\nverified in [2] and [3] that the new scalar graph approach agrees with a number of known\nconventional results for scattering amplitudes in pure gauge theory\nThe motivation of this note is to apply the new diagrammatic approach of [2] to tree\namplitudes which involve fermion fields as well as gluons. In the presence of fermions\nthere are two new classes of MHV vertices, which involve one and two quark-antiquark\nlines. This is in addition to the the single class of purely gluonic MHV vertices considered\nin [2]. All three classes of vertices can in principle be connected to one another via\npropagators at tree level. This leads to new diagrams and provides us with useful tests\nof the method. Confirmation of the new diagrammatic approach of [2] in more general\nsettings is important for two reasons. First, as mentioned earlier, this approach offers a\nmuch simpler alternative to the usual Feynman diagrams in gauge theory and can be used\nfor deriving a variety of new closed-form expressions for multi-parton tree amplitudes. Of\ncourse, in practice, in deriving multi-parton amplitudes there is no need to calculate\nFeynman diagrams directly as there are other powerful techniques based on the recursion\nrelations [4, 5]. We also note that scalar graphs as a powerful method for calculating\namplitudes in field theories with gauge fields and fermions was introduced already in [6].1\n1In the approach of [6] one also works in the helicity basis and uses scalar propagators and scalar\n1\nOur second reason for studying and generalising this approach is its relation to string\ntheory in twistor space. On the string side, the SYM amplitude is interpreted in [1]\nas coming from a D-instanton of charge d, where d is equal to the number of negative\nhelicity particles minus 1 plus the number of loops. The new scalar graph method of [2] is\ninterpreted on the string side as the contribution coming entirely from d single instantons.\nOn the other hand, in an interesting recent paper [7] it is argued that the SYM amplitude\nis fully determined by the opposite extreme case \u2013 a single d-instanton. In principle, there\nare also contributions from a mixed set of connected and disconnected instantons of total\ndegree d.\nFrom the gauge theory perspective, there are two questions we can ask:\n(1) does the scalar formalism of [2] correctly incorporate gluinos in a generic super-\nsymmetric theory, and\n(2) does it work for diagrams with fundamental quarks in a non-supersymmetric\nSU(N) theory, i.e. in QCD?\nIt is often stated in the literature that any gauge theory is supersymmetric at tree level.\nThis is because at tree level superpartners cannot propagate in loops. This observation,\non its own, does not answer the question of how to relate amplitudes with quarks to\namplitudes with gluinos. The colour structure of these amplitudes is clearly different.2\nHowever, we will see that the purely kinematic parts of these amplitudes are the same at\ntree level.\nIn the next section we briefly recall well-known results about decomposition of full\namplitudes into the colour factor Tn and the purely kinematic partial amplitude An. A\nkey point in the approach of [2] and also in [1, 7] is that only the kinematic amplitude\nAn is evaluated directly. Since An does not contain colour factors, it is the same for\ntree amplitudes involving quarks and for those with gluinos. There is an important\npoint we should stress here. Apriori, when comparing kinematic amplitudes in a non-\nsupersymmetric and in a supersymmetric theory, we should make sure that both theories\nhave a similar field content. In particular, when comparing kinematic amplitudes in QCD\nand in SYM, (at least initially) we need to restrict to the SYM theory with vectors,\nfermions and no scalars. Scalars are potentially dangerous, since they can propagate in\nvertices. However the scalar vertices utilized in [6] are not the MHV vertices used in [2] and here. We\nthank Warren Siegel for drawing our attention to Ref. [6].\n2Also, amplitudes with gluons and gluinos are automatically planar at tree level. This is not the case\nfor tree diagrams with quarks, as they do contain 1\/N -suppressed terms in SU(N) gauge theory.\n2\nthe internal lines and spoil the agreement between the amplitudes. Hence, while the\nkinematic tree-level amplitudes in massless QCD agree with those in N = 1 pure SYM,\none might worry that the agreement will be lost when comparing QCD with N = 4 (and\nN = 2) theories. Fortunately, this is not the case, the agreement between amplitudes\nin QCD and amplitudes in SYM theories does not depend on N . The main point here\nis that in N = 2 and N = 4 theories, the scalars \u03c6 couple to gluinos \u039bA and \u039bB from\ndifferent N = 1 supermultiplets,\nSYukawa = gYM tr \u039b\n\u2212\nA[\u03c6\nAB,\u039b\u2212B] + gYM tr \u039b\nA+[\u03c6AB,\u039b\nB+] , (1.1)\nwhere A,B = 1, . . .N , and \u03c6AB = \u2212\u03c6BA, hence A 6= B. At the same time, in the\nkinematic amplitudes quarks are identified with gluinos of the same fixed A, i.e.\nq \u2194 \u039bA=1+, q \u2194 \u039b\u2212A=1.\nQCD-amplitudes with m quarks, m antiquarks and l gluons in external lines corre-\nspond to SYM-amplitudes with m gluinos \u039b1+, m anti-gluinos \u039b\u22121 , and l gluons. Since\nall external (anti)-gluinos are from the same N = 1 supermultiplet, they cannot pro-\nduce scalars in the internal lines of tree diagrams. These diagrams are the same for all\nN = 0, . . . , 4. Of course, in N = 4 and N = 2 theories there are other classes of diagrams\nwith gluinos from different N = 1 supermultiplets, and also with scalars in external lines.\nApplications of the scalar graph approach to these more general classes of tree amplitudes\nin N = 2, 4 will be presented in [8].\nWe conclude that, if the new formalism gives correct results for partial amplitudes An\nin a supersymmetric theory, it will also work in a nonsupersymmetric case, and for a finite\nnumber of colours. Full amplitudes are then determined uniquely from the kinematic part\nAn, and the known expressions for Tn, given in (2.3), (2.5) below. This means that for\ntree amplitudes questions (1) and (2) are essentially the same.\nIn section 3 we explain how the diagrammatic approach of [2] works for calculating\nscattering amplitudes of gluons and fermions at tree level. This method leads to explicit\nand relatively simple expressions for many amplitudes. As a first example, using the scalar\ngraph approach, we derive an expression for non-MHV \u2212\u2212\u2212+ . . .+ amplitudes An with\ntwo fermions and n \u2212 2 gluons. We furthermore derive a non-MHV n-point amplitude\nwhich involves four fermions. These new results are checked successfully against some\npreviously known expressions for n = 4, 5.\nIn section 4 we outline some obvious conceptual difficulties in addressing loop contri-\nbutions to n-point amplitudes in a massless gauge theory without an infrared cutoff.\n3\n2 Tree Amplitudes\nWe concentrate on tree-level amplitudes in a gauge theory with an arbitrary finite number\nof colours. For definiteness we take the gauge group to be SU(N) and consider tree-level\nscattering amplitudes with arbitrary numbers of external gluons and fermions (it is also\nstraightforward to include scalar fields, but we leave them out from most of what follows\nfor simplicity). SU(N) is unbroken and all fields are taken to be massless, we refer to\nthem generically as gluons, gluinos and quarks, though the gauge theory is not necessarily\nassumed to be supersymmetric.\n2.1 Colour decomposition\nIt is well-known that a full n-point amplitudeMn can be represented as a sum of products\nof colour factors Tn and purely kinematic partial amplitudes An,\nMn({ki, hi, ci}) =\n\u2211\n\u03c3\nTn({c\u03c3(i)})An({k\u03c3(i), h\u03c3(i)}) . (2.1)\nHere {ci} are colour labels of external legs i = 1 . . . n, and the kinematic variables {ki, hi}\nare on-shell external momenta and helicities: all k2i = 0, and hi = \u00b11 for gluons, hi = \u00b1\n1\n2\nfor fermions. The sum in (2.1) is over appropriate simultaneous permutations \u03c3 of colour\nlabels {c\u03c3(i)} and kinematic variables {k\u03c3(i), h\u03c3(i)}. The colour factors Tn are easy to\ndetermine, and the non-trivial information about the full amplitude Mn is contained in\nthe purely kinematic part An. If the partial amplitudes An({ki, hi}) are known for all\npermutations \u03c3 of the kinematic variables, the full amplitude Mn can be determined\nfrom (2.1).\nWe first consider tree amplitudes with arbitrary numbers of gluons and gluinos (and\nwith no quarks). The colour variables {ci} correspond to the adjoint representation in-\ndices, {ci} = {ai}, and the colour factor Tn is a single trace of generators,\nMtreen ({ki, hi, ai}) =\n\u2211\n\u03c3\ntr(Ta\u03c3(1) . . .Ta\u03c3(n)) Atreen (k\u03c3(1), h\u03c3(1), . . . , k\u03c3(n), h\u03c3(n)) . (2.2)\nHere the sum is over (n\u2212 1)! noncyclic inequivalent permutations of n external particles.\nThe single-trace structure in (2.2),\nTn = tr(T\na1 . . .Tan) , (2.3)\nimplies that all tree level amplitudes of particles transforming in the adjoint representation\nof SU(N) are planar. This is not the case neither for loop amplitudes, nor for tree\namplitudes involving fundamental quarks.\n4\nFields in the fundamental representation couple to the trace U(1) factor of the U(N)\ngauge group. In passing to the SU(N) case this introduces power-suppressed 1\/Np terms.\nHowever, there is a remarkable simplification for tree diagrams involving fundamental\nquarks: the factorisation property (2.1) still holds. More precisely, for a fixed colour\nordering \u03c3, the amplitude with m quark-antiquark pairs and l gluons (and gluinos) is still\na perfect product,\nTl+2m({c\u03c3(i)}) Al+2m({k\u03c3(i), h\u03c3(i)}) , (2.4)\nand all 1\/Np corrections to the amplitude are contained in the first term. For tree ampli-\ntudes the exact colour factor in (2.4) is [9]\nTl+2m =\n(\u22121)p\nNp\n(Ta1 . . .Tal1 )i1\u03b11(T\nal1+1 . . .Tal2 )i2\u03b12 . . . (T\nalm\u22121+1 . . .Tal)im\u03b1m . (2.5)\nHere l1, . . . , lm correspond to an arbitrary partition of an arbitrary permutation of the l\ngluon indices; i1, . . . im are colour indices of quarks, and \u03b11, . . . \u03b1m \u2013 of the antiquarks.\nIn perturbation theory each external quark is connected by a fermion line to an external\nantiquark (all particles are counted as incoming). When quark ik is connected by a fermion\nline to antiquark \u03b1k, we set \u03b1k = i\u00afk. Thus, the set of \u03b11, . . . \u03b1m is a permutation of the\nset i\u00af1, . . . i\u00afm. Finally, the power p is equal to the number of times \u03b1k = i\u00afk minus 1. When\nthere is only one quark-antiquark pair, m=1 and p=0. For a general m, the power p in\n(2.5) varies from 0 to m\u2212 1.\nThe kinematic amplitudes Al+2m in (2.4) have the colour information stripped off and\nhence do not distinguish between fundamental quarks and adjoint gluinos. Thus,\nAl+2m(q, . . . , q\u00af, . . . , g\n+, . . . , g\u2212, . . .) = Al+2m(\u039b\n+, . . . ,\u039b\u2212, . . . , g+, . . . , g\u2212, . . .) , (2.6)\nwhere q, q\u00af, g\u00b1, \u039b\u00b1 denote quarks, antiquarks, gluons and gluinos of \u00b1 helicity.\nIn section 3 we will use the scalar graph formalism of [2] to evaluate the kinematic\namplitudes An in (2.6). Full amplitudes can then be determined uniquely from the kine-\nmatic part An, and the known expressions for Tn in (2.3) and (2.5) by summing over the\ninequivalent colour orderings in (2.1).\nFrom now on we concentrate on the purely kinematic part of the amplitude, An.\n2.2 Helicity amplitudes\nWe will be studying tree level partial amplitudes An = Al+2m with l gluons and 2m\nfermions in the helicity basis. All external lines are defined to be incoming, and a fermion\n5\nof helicity +1\n2\nis always connected by a fermion propagator to a helicity \u22121\n2\nfermion,3\nhence the number of fermions 2m is always even.\nA tree amplitude An with n or n\u2212 1 particles of positive helicity vanishes identically.\nThe same is true for An with n or n\u2212 1 particles of negative helicity. First nonvanishing\namplitudes contain n\u22122 particles with helicities of the same sign and are called maximal\nhelicity violating (MHV) amplitudes.\nThe spinor helicity formalism4 is defined in terms of two commuting spinors of positive\nand negative chirality, \u03bba and \u03bb\u02dca\u02d9. Using these spinors, any on-shell momentum of a\nmassless particle, p\u00b5p\n\u00b5 = 0, can be written as\npaa\u02d9 = p\u00b5\u03c3\n\u00b5 = \u03bba\u03bb\u02dca\u02d9 . (2.7)\nSpinor inner products are introduced as\n\u3008\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032\u3009 = \u01ebab\u03bb\na\u03bb\u2032b , [\u03bb\u02dc, \u03bb\u02dc\u2032] = \u01eba\u02d9b\u02d9\u03bb\u02dc\na\u02d9\u03bb\u02dc\u2032b\u02d9 . (2.8)\nThen a scalar product of two null vectors, paa\u02d9 = \u03bba\u03bb\u02dca\u02d9 and qaa\u02d9 = \u03bb\n\u2032\na\u03bb\u02dc\n\u2032\na\u02d9, is\np\u00b5q\n\u00b5 =\n1\n2\n\u3008\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032\u3009[\u03bb\u02dc, \u03bb\u02dc\u2032] . (2.9)\nMomentum conservation in an n-point amplitude provides another useful identity\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u3008\u03bbr \u03bbi\u3009[\u03bb\u02dci \u03bb\u02dcs] = 0 , (2.10)\nfor arbitrary 1 \u2264 r, s \u2264 n.\nIn the usual perturbative evaluation of amplitudes, external on-shell lines in Feynman\ndiagrams are multiplied by wave-function factors: a polarization vector \u03b5\u00b5\u00b1 for each exter-\nnal gluon A\u00b5, and spinors u\u00b1 and u\u00af\u00b1 for external quarks and antiquarks. The resulting\namplitude is a Lorentz scalar. The spinors \u03bb and \u03bb\u02dc are precisely the wave-functions of\nfermions and corresponding antifermions (see Appendix for more detail)\nu+(ki)a = \u03bbi a , u+(ki)a\u02d9 = \u03bb\u02dci a\u02d9 , (2.11)\n3This is generally correct only in theories without scalar fields. In the N = 4 theory, a pair of positive\nhelicity fermions, \u039b1+, \u039b2+, can be connected to another pair of positive helicity fermions, \u039b3+, \u039b4+,\nby a scalar propagator. As already mentioned in the introduction, for all amplitudes considered in this\npaper we will take external fermions from the same N = 1 supermultiplet, i.e. A = 1, and this will rule\nout contributions of scalar fields even in the N = 4 theory.\n4This formalism was used for calculating scattering amplitudes first in [10, 11, 4]. We follow conven-\ntions of [1] and refer the reader also to comprehensive reviews [9, 12] where more detail and references\ncan be found. Our helicity spinor conventions are summarised in the Appendix\n6\nand the polarization vectors \u03b5\u00b5\u00b1 are also defined in a natural way in terms of \u03bb, \u03bb\u02dc (and a\n\u2018reference\u2019 spinor), as in [1].\nAn(g\n+\n1 , . . . , g\n+\nr\u22121, g\n\u2212\nr , g\n+\nr+1, . . . , g\n+\ns\u22121, g\n\u2212\ns , g\n+\ns+1, . . . , g\n+\nn ) is the \u2018mostly plus\u2019 purely gluonic\nMHV amplitude with n \u2212 2 gluons of positive helicity and 2 gluons of negative helicity\nin positions r and s. To simplify notation, from now on we will not indicate the positive\nhelicity gluons in the mostly plus amplitudes and the negative helicity gluons in the\nmostly minus amplitudes. Also, the mostly plus maximal helicity violating amplitudes\nwill be referred to simply as the MHV amplitudes, and the mostly minus maximal helicity\nviolating amplitudes will be called the MHV. Finally, in all the amplitudes An we will\nsuppress the common momentum conservation factor of\nign\u22122YM (2\u03c0)\n4 \u03b4(4)\n( n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbia\u03bb\u02dcia\u02d9\n)\n(2.12)\nUsing these conventions, the MHV gluonic amplitude is\nAn(g\n\u2212\nr , g\n\u2212\ns ) =\n\u3008\u03bbr, \u03bbs\u30094\u220fn\ni=1\u3008\u03bbi, \u03bbi+1\u3009\n\u2261\n\u3008r s\u30094\u220fn\ni=1\u3008i i+ 1\u3009\n, (2.13)\nwhere \u03bbn+1 \u2261 \u03bb1. The corresponding MHV amplitude with positive helicity gluons in\npositions r and s is\nAn(g\n+\nr , g\n+\ns ) =\n[\u03bb\u02dcr, \u03bb\u02dcs]\n4\u220fn\ni=1[\u03bb\u02dci, \u03bb\u02dci+1]\n\u2261\n[r s]4\u220fn\ni=1[i i+ 1]\n. (2.14)\nThe closed-form expressions (2.13), (2.14) were derived in [11, 4]. These and other results\nin the helicity formalism are reviewed in [9, 12].\nAn MHV amplitude An = Al+2m with l gluons and 2m fermions (from the same N = 1\nsupermultiplet) exists only for m = 0, 1, 2. This is because it must have precisely n \u2212 2\nparticles with positive and 2 with negative helicities, and our fermions always come in\npairs with helicities \u00b11\n2\n. Hence, including (2.13), there are three types of MHV tree\namplitudes,\nAn(g\n\u2212\nr , g\n\u2212\ns ) , An(g\n\u2212\nt ,\u039b\n\u2212\nr ,\u039b\n+\ns ) , An(\u039b\n\u2212\nt ,\u039b\n+\ns ,\u039b\n\u2212\nr ,\u039b\n+\nq ) . (2.15)\nExpressions for all three MHV amplitudes in (2.15) can be simply read off the N = 4\nsupersymmetric formula of Nair [13]:\nAN=4n = \u03b4\n(8)\n( n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbia\u03b7\nA\ni\n) 1\u220fn\ni=1\u3008i i+ 1\u3009\n, (2.16)\n7\nwhere \u03b7Ai , A = 1, 2, 3, 4 is the N = 4 Grassmann coordinate. Taylor expanding (2.16) in\npowers of \u03b7i, one can identify each term in the expansion with a particular tree-level MHV\namplitude in the N = 4 theory. (\u03b7i)k for k = 0, . . . , 4 is interpreted as the ith particle\nwith helicity hi = 1 \u2212\nk\n2\n. Hence, hi = {1,\n1\n2\n, 0,\u22121\n2\n,\u22121}, where zero is the helicity of a\nscalar field. It is straightforward to write down a general rule for associating a power of\n\u03b7 with all component fields in N = 4,\ng\u2212i \u2190 \u03b7\n1\ni \u03b7\n2\ni \u03b7\n3\ni \u03b7\n4\ni , \u03c6\nAB \u2190 \u03b7Ai \u03b7\nB\ni , \u039b\nA+ \u2190 \u03b7Ai , g\n\u2212\ni \u2190 1 ,\n\u039b\u22121 \u2190 \u2212 \u03b7\n2\ni \u03b7\n3\ni \u03b7\n4\ni , \u039b\n\u2212\n2 \u2190 \u2212 \u03b7\n1\ni \u03b7\n3\ni \u03b7\n4\ni , \u039b\n\u2212\n3 \u2190 \u2212 \u03b7\n1\ni \u03b7\n2\ni \u03b7\n4\ni , \u039b\n\u2212\n4 \u2190 \u2212 \u03b7\n1\ni \u03b7\n2\ni \u03b7\n3\ni .\n(2.17)\nThe amplitude (2.13) can be obtained from (2.16), (2.17) by selecting the (\u03b7r)\n4 (\u03b7s)\n4\nterm; the second amplitude in (2.15) follows an appropriate (\u03b7t)\n4(\u03b7r)\n3(\u03b7s)\n1 term in (2.16);\nand the third amplitude in (2.15) is an (\u03b7r)\n3(\u03b7s)\n1(\u03b7p)\n3(\u03b7q)\n1 term. For our calculations in\naddition to (2.13) we will need expressions for MHV amplitudes with m = 1 and m = 2\npairs of fermions (with the same A). The MHV amplitude with two external fermions\nand n\u2212 2 gluons is\nAn(g\n\u2212\nt ,\u039b\n\u2212\nr ,\u039b\n+\ns ) =\n\u3008t r\u30093 \u3008t s\u3009\u220fn\ni=1\u3008i i+ 1\u3009\n, An(g\n\u2212\nt ,\u039b\n+\ns ,\u039b\n\u2212\nr ) = \u2212\n\u3008t r\u30093 \u3008t s\u3009\u220fn\ni=1\u3008i i+ 1\u3009\n, (2.18)\nwhere the first expression corresponds to r < s and the second to s < r (and t is arbitrary).\nThe MHV amplitudes with four fermions and n\u2212 4 gluons on external lines are\nAn(\u039b\n\u2212\nt ,\u039b\n+\ns ,\u039b\n\u2212\nr ,\u039b\n+\nq ) =\n\u3008t r\u30093 \u3008s q\u3009\u220fn\ni=1\u3008i i+ 1\u3009\n, An(\u039b\n\u2212\nt ,\u039b\n\u2212\nr ,\u039b\n+\ns ,\u039b\n+\nq ) = \u2212\n\u3008t r\u30093 \u3008s q\u3009\u220fn\ni=1\u3008i i+ 1\u3009\n(2.19)\nThe first expression in (2.19) corresponds to t < s < r < q, the second \u2013 to t < r < s < q,\nand there are other similar aexpressions, obtained by further permutations of fermions,\nwith the overall sign determined by the ordering.\nThe MHV amplitude can be obtained, as always, by exchanging helicities +\u2194 \u2212 and\n\u3008i j\u3009 \u2194 [i j]. Expressions (2.18), (2.19) can also be derived from N = 1 supersymmetric\nWard identities, as in [9, 12].\nAll amplitudes following from Nair\u2019s general expression (2.16) are analytic in the\nsense that they depend only on \u3008\u03bbi \u03bbj\u3009 spinor products, and not on [\u03bb\u02dci \u03bb\u02dci]. These include\namplitudes in (2.13), (2.18), (2.19), as well as more complicated classes of amplitudes, i.e.\nwith external gluinos \u039bA, \u039bB 6=A, etc, and with external scalar fields. These extra classes\nof analytic amplitudes, interpreted as vertices in the scalar graph approach, are being\ninvestigated in [8] and will not be discussed here further.\n8\n3 Calculating Amplitudes Using Scalar Graphs\nThe formalism of [2] represents all non-MHV tree amplitudes (including MHV) as sums\nof tree diagrams in an effective scalar perturbation theory. The vertices in this theory\nare the MHV amplitudes (2.15), continued off-shell as described below, and connected by\nscalar bosonic propagators 1\/p2.\nAn obvious question one might ask is why one should use the 1\/p2 propagator when\nconnecting fermion lines in MHV vertices (2.15). To answer this, recall that the vertices\n(2.15) already contain the wave-function factors for all external lines, including fermions\n(2.11). An incoming fermion in one MHV vertex, connected by 1\/p2 to an incoming\nantifermion of another MHV vertex, corresponds to a factor of\nu+(p)a\n1\np2\nu+(p)a\u02d9 =\np\/ aa\u02d9\np2\n, (3.1)\nfor an internal line in the usual Feynman diagram, which is just the right answer. There\nis a subtlety with choosing the ordering of fermions in each vertex which is explained in\nAppendix in equations (4.5) and (4.7).\nWhen one leg of an MHV vertex is connected by a propagator to a leg of another\nMHV vertex, both of these legs become internal to the diagram and have to be continued\noff-shell. Off-shell continuation is defined as follows [2]: we pick an arbitrary spinor \u03b7a\u02d9\nand define \u03bba for any internal line carrying momentum paa\u02d9 by\n\u03bba = paa\u02d9\u03b7\na\u02d9 . (3.2)\nThe same \u03b7 is used for all the off-shell lines in all diagrams contributing to a given\namplitude. In practice it will be convenient to choose \u03b7a\u02d9 to be equal to \u03bb\u02dca\u02d9 of one of the\nexternal legs of negative helicity. External lines in a diagram remain on-shell, and for\nthem \u03bb is defined in the usual way.\nSince in each MHV vertex (2.15) there are precisely two lines with negative helicities,\nand since a propagator always connects lines with opposite helicities, there is a simple\nrelation between the number of negative helicity particles in a given amplitude and the\nnumber of MHV vertices needed to construct it,\nq(\u22121) + q(\u2212 1\n2\n) =\n\u2211\nv \u2212 1 . (3.3)\nHere q(\u22121) is the number of negative helicity gluons, q(\u2212 1\n2\n) is the number of negative helicity\nfermions, and\n\u2211\nv is the total number of all MHV vertices (2.15) needed to construct this\namplitude.\n9\nThis formalism leads to explicit and relatively simple expressions for many amplitudes.\nn-point amplitudes with three particles of negative helicity is the next case beyond simple\nMHV amplitudes.\n3.1 Calculating \u2212\u2212\u2212+++ . . .++ amplitudes with 2 fermions\nTo illustrate the power of the method in pure gauge theory, the authors of [2] have\ncalculated n gluon amplitudes with three consecutive gluons of negative helicity \u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 + + + . . . + +. In order to see precisely what is new when fermions are present, and\nto provide another useful application of the method, in this section we will calculate a\nsimilar amplitude with three negative helicities which are now carried by a fermion and\ntwo gluons.\nWe consider an n-point amplitude,\nAn(\u039b\n\u2212\n1 , g\n\u2212\n2 , g\n\u2212\n3 ,\u039b\n+\nk ) , (3.4)\nwith one fermion and two gluons of negative helicities consecutive to each other, and a\npositive-helicity fermion in arbitrary position k, such that 3 < k \u2264 n. As in the case\nconsidered in [2], this amplitude comes from scalar diagrams with two vertices and one\npropagator, but in our case there is more that one type of vertex in (2.15). There are\nthree classes of scalar diagrams which contribute to An(\u039b\n\u2212\n1 , g\n\u2212\n2 , g\n\u2212\n3 ,\u039b\n+\nk ), they are depicted\nin Figure 1. First two classes of diagrams involve the first and the second vertex in (2.15),\nand the third class involves two second vertices in (2.15).\nFirst two diagrams in Figure 1 involve a gluon exchange. The third diagram involves\na fermion exchange, and can be schematically represented as\nA(\u039b\u22121 , g\n\u2212\n2 ,\u039b\n+\nI )\n1\nq2I\nA(g\u22123 ,\u039b\n+\nk ,\u039b\n\u2212\n\u2212I) . (3.5)\nHere \u039b+I and \u039b\n\u2212\n\u2212I denote internal off-shell fermions, which are Wick-contracted via the\nscalar propagator 1\/q2I . The order in which these internal fermion appear in (3.5) is ac-\ncording to the ket+ ket\u2212 prescription discussed in the Appendix.\n10\ni+\ni+\ni+\n(i+ 1)+\n(i+ 1)+\n(i+ 1)+\nk+\nk+\nk+\nn+\nn+\nn+\n1\u2212\n1\u2212\n1\u2212\n2\u2212\n2\u2212\n2\u2212\n3\u2212\n3\u2212\n3\u2212\n4+\n4+\n4+\n+\n+\n+\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\nFigure 1: Tree diagrams with MHV vertices contributing to the \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 + + + . . . + +\namplitude with 2 fermions and n \u2212 2 gluons in Eq.

The corresponding\noff-shell spinor \u03bbij a is defined as in (3.2), \u03bbij a = qij aa\u02d9\u03b7\na\u02d9. All other spinors \u03bbi are on-shell\nand \u3008i (j, k)\u3009 is an abbreviation for a spinor product \u3008\u03bbi, \u03bbjk\u3009.\nAs in [2] we choose \u03b7a\u02d9 = \u03bb\u02dca\u02d92, and evaluate the amplitude (3.6) as a function of the\non-shell kinematic variables, \u03bbi and \u03bb\u02dc1, \u03bb\u02dc2, \u03bb\u02dc3. The final expression for the amplitude can\n11\nbe written as the sum of three terms:\nAn =\n1\u220fn\nl=3 \u3008l l + 1\u3009\n[\nA(1)n + A\n(2)\nn + A\n(3)\nn\n]\n. (3.7)\nWe have to treat the i = 3 term in the first sum in (3.6) and the i = n term in the last\nsum in (3.6) separately, as individually they are singular for our choice of \u03b7a\u02d9 = \u03bb\u02dca\u02d92.

(4.3) in the Appendix. We also used momentum conservation to set q3,i = \u2212qi+1,2,\nand the anticommuting nature of spinor products to simplify the formula.\nThe second term in (3.7) is the contribution of the third line in (3.6) for i 6= n.

(3.9)\nThe remaining terms \u2013 the i = 3 term in the first sum in (3.6) and the i = n term in the last\nsum in (3.6) \u2013 both contain a factor [2 \u03b7] in the denominator and are singular for |\u03b7\u2212\u3009 =\n|2\u2212\u3009. For the method to work, the singularity has to cancel between the two terms. This\nis indeed the case, and rather nontrivially the cancellation occurs between the diagrams\nof different types \u2013 the first and the last in Figure 1 \u2013 with different MHV vertices. After\nthe singularity cancels, the remaining finite contribution from these two terms is derived\nby setting |\u03b7\u2212\u3009 = |2\u2212\u3009 + |\u01eb\u2212\u3009, bringing two terms to a common denominator and using\nSchouten\u2019s identity, [\u03b1 \u03b2][\u03b3 \u03b4] + [\u03b1 \u03b3][\u03b4 \u03b2] + [\u03b1 \u03b4][\u03b2 \u03b3] = 0.

In this\nsection we will calculate an n-point amplitude with 4 fermions for three negative helicities\nconsecuitive to each other,\nAn(g\n\u2212\n1 ,\u039b\n\u2212\n2 ,\u039b\n\u2212\n3 ,\u039b\n+\np ,\u039b\n+\nq ) , (3.20)\nwhere 3 < p < q \u2264 n. As always, positive-helicity gluons in amplitudes will not be\nindicated explicitly, unless they appear in internal lines.\nThere are four scalar diagrams which contribute to this process. They are drawn\nin Figure 2. The first diagram in Figure 2 is a gluon exchange between two 2-fermion\nMHV-vertices. This diagram has a schematic form,\nA(g\u22121 ,\u039b\n\u2212\n2 , g\n+\nI ,\u039b\n+\nq )\n1\nq2I\nA(\u039b\u22123 ,\u039b\n+\np , g\n\u2212\n\u2212I) . (3.21)\nHere g+I and g\n\u2212\n\u2212I are off-shell (internal) gluons which are Wick-contracted via a scalar\npropagator, and I = (3, i).\nThe second diagram involves a gluon exchange between a 0-fermion and a 4-fermion\nMHV vertex,\nA(g\u22121 , g\n\u2212\nI )\n1\nq2I\nA(\u039b\u22122 ,\u039b\n\u2212\n3 ,\u039b\n+\np ,\u039b\n+\nq , g\n+\n\u2212I) , (3.22)\nwith external index I = (2, i).

They are given, respectively by\nA(\u039b\u22122 ,\u039b\n\u2212\n3 ,\u039b\n+\np ,\u039b\n+\n\u2212I)\n1\nq2I\nA(\u039b+q , g\n\u2212\n1 ,\u039b\n\u2212\nI ) , (3.23)\nwith I = (2, i), and\nA(g\u22121 ,\u039b\n\u2212\n2 ,\u039b\n+\nI )\n1\nq2I\nA(\u039b\u22123 ,\u039b\n+\np ,\u039b\n+\nq ,\u039b\n\u2212\n\u2212I) , (3.24)\nwith I = (3, i). Both expressions, (3.23) and (3.24), are written in the form which is in\nagreement with our ordering prescription for internal fermions, ket+ ket\u2212.\nWe will continue using the same of-shell prescription \u03b7a\u02d9 = \u03bb\u02dca\u02d92 as in the section 3.1. But\nthere is an importnat simplification in the present case compared to 3.1 \u2013 there will be\nno singular terms appearing in individual diagrams. This is because the reference spinor\n\u03b7a\u02d9 = \u03bb\u02dca\u02d92 now corresponds to a gluino, rather than a gluon g\n\u2212. The reason for singularities\nencountered in section 3.1 and in Ref. [2] was simply the singular collinear limit of the\n3-gluon vertex where all gluons went on-shell. We will see that these singularities would\nnot occur in the present case, and not having to cancel them will save us some work.5\nFor extra clarity we will first present a simpler version of the evaluation of (3.20) for\nthe case n = 5. This result will then be generalized to all values of n. For n = 5, we set\np = 4 and q = 5 in (3.20), and the calculation is straightforward.\n1. The first diagram in Figure 2, Eq.

(3.27)\nNow, we need to add up the three contributions. We first combine the expressions in\n(3.25) and (3.26) into\n[4 5]2\n[2 1][3 4][5 1]\n\u2212\n\u30083 1\u30092\n[2 1]\u30083 4\u3009\u30085 1\u3009\n(3.28)\nusing momentum conservation identitites, and the fact that \u30082 3\u3009[2 3] + \u30082 4\u3009[2 4] =\n\u2212\u30083 4\u3009[3 4] + \u30085 1\u3009[5 1]. Then, adding the remaining contribution (3.27) we obtain the\nfinal result for the amplitude,\nA5(g\n\u2212\n1 ,\u039b\n\u2212\n2 ,\u039b\n\u2212\n3 ,\u039b\n+\n4 ,\u039b\n+\n5 ) =\n\u2212[4 5]3[2 3]\n[1 2][2 3][3 4][4 5][5 1]\n.

(3.36)\nAll the individual terms are regular, and the equation above is the final result of this\nsection.\n4 Loop Amplitudes and IR Divergencies\nAn intriguing question is how to go beyond the tree level. There are some obvious con-\nceptual problems in trying to work with loop amplitudes, directly in 4 dimensions and\nwithout an infrared cutoff (e.g. in the superconformal N = 4 SYM). Loop amplitudes in\nmassless gauge theories suffer from severe infrared (IR) \u2013 soft and collinear \u2013 divergen-\ncies. At tree-level there are no integrations over loop momenta and IR divergencies in the\namplitudes can be avoided by selecting a non-exceptional set of external momenta (i.e the\nset with none of the external momenta being collinear or soft). Hence tree amplitudes\ncan be made IR finite and it is meaningful to be calculating them directly in 4D without\nan explicit IR cutoff.\nLoop amplitudes, however, are always IR divergent, in other words, one cannot choose\na set of external momenta which would make an on-shell loop amplitude finite in 4D. These\nIR divergencies simply reflect the fact that the naive S-matrix and scattering amplitudes\nsimply do not exist in a gauge theory with massless particles. In QCD (and QED)\n18\nthis problem is avoided either by calculating cross-sections directly or by defining new\nasymptotic initial and final states with indefinite numbers of massless quarks and gluons.\nThe Kinoshita-Lee-Naunberg theorem states that all the IR divergencies cancel (collinear\nwith collinear, soft with soft) in properly defined physical observables, when one sums\nover degenerate initial as well as final states.\nIn the superconformal N = 4 theory the situation is less clear. Well-defined ob-\nservables of this theory are not the amplitudes, but Green functions of gauge-invariant\ncomposite operators, and the latter were used successfully in the context of the AdS\/CFT\ncorrespondence.\nIt would be very interesting to understand better what are the relevant infrared-safe\nquantities in a 4-dimensional gauge theory which can be deduced from a dual string theory\nin twistor space.\nAcknowledgements\nVVK would like to thank participants of \u2018Strings, Gauge Fields and Duality\u2019 conference\nin Swansea, where this work was started, for useful conversations.

It should be noted, that slightly different sign conventions from (4.1) have\nbeen used in earlier literature for [i j]. For example, in [12] the dotted spinor product,\n[i j], is defined as \u03bb\u02dci a\u02d9 \u03bb\u02dc\na\u02d9\nj = \u2212\u03bb\u02dc\na\u02d9\ni \u03bb\u02dcj a\u02d9. In conventions of [12], equation (2.9) would have a\nminus sign on the right hand side.\nAn on-shell momentum of a massless particle, p\u00b5k can be written as\npk aa\u02d9 = pk\u00b5 \u03c3\n\u00b5 = \u03bbk a \u03bb\u02dck a\u02d9 . (4.2)\nIn section 3 we use a Lorentz-invariant combination \u3008i\u2212|p\/ k|j\n\u2212\u3009 = ia pk aa\u02d9 j a\u02d9, which in\nterms of the spinor products (4.1) is\n\u3008i\u2212|p\/ k|j\n\u2212\u3009 = \u3008i\u2212|a |k+\u3009a \u3008k\n+|a\u02d9 |j\n\u2212\u3009a\u02d9 = \u2212\u3008i k\u3009 [k j] = \u3008i k\u3009 [j k] . (4.3)\nThe spinors \u03bb and \u03bb\u02dc appearing in the helicity formalism are precisely the wave-\nfunctions of fermions of positive and negative helicities,\n\u3008i\u2212|a = \u03bb ai = u\u2212(ki)\na , |i+\u3009a = \u03bbi a = u+(ki)a ,\n\u3008i+|a\u02d9 = \u03bb\u02dc a\u02d9i = u+(ki)\na\u02d9 , |i\u2212\u3009a\u02d9 = \u03bb\u02dci a\u02d9 = u\u2212(ki)a\u02d9 .\n(4.4)\nIn our conventions for MHV vertices we treat all fermions and antifermions as incom-\ning and the fermion propagator connects two incoming fermions with opposite helicities.\nThus, the completeness relation relevant for us and with a correct index structure gives\n|i+\u3009a |i\n\u2212\u3009a\u02d9\nk2i\n=\n\u03bbi a \u03bb\u02dci a\u02d9\nk2i\n=\nk\/i aa\u02d9\nk2i\n, (4.5)\nwhich is, of course, the correct fermion propagator in usual Feynman perturbation theory.\nScalars have no wave-functions, and their propagator remains 1\/k2, and vectors give\n(in Feynman gauge)\n\u03b5\u00b5+ \u03b5\n\u03bd\n\u2212\nk2\n=\n\u2212g\u00b5\u03bd\nk2\n, (4.6)\nwhich is the correct form of the massless vector boson propagator.\n20\nAn important consequence of (4.5) is the ordering prescription of fermions in MHV\nvertices. This concerns only the case of scalar diagrams with internal fermion lines, such\nas the third diagram in Figure 1. In this case, in order to get the ket+ ket\u2212 structure\n|i+\u3009a| \u2212 i\n\u2212\u3009a\u02d9 the two fermions which are to be connected by a propagator should be both\non the right of each vertex (rather than adjacent to each other). This means that, for\nexample, the third diagram in Figure 1 comes from\nA(\u039b\u22121 , g\n\u2212\n2 ,\u039b\n+\n(3i)) A(g\n\u2212\n3 ,\u039b\n+\nk ,\u039b\n\u2212\n\u2212(3i)) . (4.7)\nIf the contracted fermion factors, \u039b+(3i) and \u039b\n\u2212\n\u2212(3i) were, instead, chosen to be next to each\nother, the overall contribution would change sign, since fermions anticommute with each\nother.\nReferences\n[1] E.
