Cantwell and Morton [7] \nhave shown that the response of a CFRP panel to these two very different loading \nregimes is quite different. On the one hand, for low velocity impact, the size and shape of \nthe panel determine its energy absorbing capability. Whereas on the other hand, high \nvelocity projectiles induce a localised response in the target that does not depend on the \nareal size of the target. \nHammond et al [8] studied the response of relatively thin (1.8-2.5 mm) CFRP \npanels of different symmetrical lay-ups struck by a 12.7 mm steel projectile that had an \naverage velocity of 474 m\/s. Here they showed that microstructural damage mechanisms \nwere similar regardless of lay-up with the major differences being the volume over which \nthe damage was spread.  Tanabe et al [9] tested CFRPs of 2 mm thickness that were made \nwith different interfacial strengths, properties and sequences of reinforcing fibres. Again \nthe sequences of the lay-ups were symmetrical. These were struck by 5-mm steel spheres \nin the velocity range of 150-314 m\/s. Their experimental work showed that at 150 m\/s, a \nweak interface resulted in higher energy absorption. Interestingly, they also observed that \nthere is no clear difference in the ballistic performance of cross-ply specimens and \nspecimens consisting of woven cloth. Further work by Tanabe and co-workers [10] have \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 4\nshown that the interfaces between fibre lay-ups are particularly important. They measured \nthe stress and strain using PVDF stress gauges and constantan strain gauges to assess the \neffect of reinforcing fibres. They showed that the maximum stress generated depended on \nthe reinforcing fibres whereas weak interfaces seemed to result in low stresses and \nstrains.  \nMost work to date has been done using composites consisting of a symmetrical \nsequence of lay up. Some low velocity impact work has shown that the sequence of lay \nup for a symmetrical lay up has a minor effect on the resistance to penetration whereas \ntarget thickness and loading rate have a greater significance [11]. The sequence of lay up \nfor symmetrical composites only seems to have a small effect on the impact response of \nCFRP laminates at much higher velocities as well [8]. However, the effect of the \nsequence of lay up on asymmetric composite materials on their energy absorption ability \nand the consequential damage have not been extensively studied. Furthermore, for the \nstudy of impact and penetration of CFRP laminates there is a paucity of data on the \noblique penetration of these types of materials and, in particular, woven CFRP laminates \nthat are presently used in the aerospace industries. Most impacts from high velocity \nprojectiles will occur with some degree of obliquity and consequently, it is important to \nunderstand the effect that obliquity has on a penetrating projectile. \nIn this study, we examine the response of two thicknesses of woven CFRP to \nimpact and penetration by a fully annealed stainless steel sphere between the velocity \nregime of 170 m\/s and 374 m\/s. Both impact at normal incidence and impact at an \noblique angle of 45\u00b0 are studied. This work is part of a wider study on the dynamic \nbehaviour of woven CFRP laminates. \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 5\nEXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY \n \nMaterials Used \n \nThe materials chosen for this study were woven CFRP laminates that were \nmanufactured using the resin transfer moulding method (RTM). These laminates were \nchosen because they are commonly used in the aerospace industry.  Two different \nthicknesses of CFRP material supplied by Short Brothers plc. were tested: 3 mm and 6 \nmm. All individual panels were manufactured with Hexcel G0926 Carbon Fabric with a 5 \nharness satin weave. The resin used was Hexcel RTM 6 cured for 1 hour 40 minutes at \n180 \u00b0C and at a pressure of 100 psi. The 3 mm thickness CFRP panels comprised of 8 \nplies in a quasi-isotropic (\u00b145, 0\/90, \u00b145, 0\/90)s lay-up. The 6-mm thick CFRP panel was \nmade from 16 plies with the lay-up (0\/90, \u00b1 45, \u00b1 45, 0\/90, \u00b1 45, \u00b1 45, 0\/90, 0\/90, \u00b145, \n0\/90, \u00b1 45, 0\/90, \u00b145, 0\/90, \u00b1 45, 0\/90). Separate results are presented for panels that \nwere orientated so that the impact occurred on the (0\/90, \u00b1 45, \u00b1 45) face and the (0\/90, \n\u00b145, 0\/90) face. The density of the CFRP material, measured using a Micrometrics \nAccuPyc 1330 gas pycnometer, was 1.512 g\/cc \u00b1 0.001 g\/cc. The mass fraction of the \nreinforcement was measured using the acid digestion method according to ASTM D \n3171-6, Procedure B. [12] and was found to be 69.7\u00b11.0% for the 6 mm thick composite \nand 66.4\u00b10.3% for the 3 mm thick samples. \n \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 6\nImpact testing \n \nThe projectile used was a fully annealed stainless steel sphere (\u220511.97 mm \u00b1 0.01 \nmm; mass = 7.165 g \u00b1 0.001 g; VHN = 127). The balls (SS304) were fully annealed in air \nat 1050\u00b0C to provide equiaxed austenite grains and consequently isotropic behavior. The \nyield strength of this steel at 21\u00b0C is 450 MPa with an ultimate tensile strength of 675 \nMPa [13]. The projectile was fired from ELVIS, a single stage \u220522-mm gas-gun. Target \nspecimens were cut from supplied material into 150 mm \u00d7 150 mm squares using a \ndiamond-wheel cutter and secured into a target holder by clamping at the top and bottom \nof the specimen. Some 6 mm thick panels were also clamped at the bottom only in order \nto evaluate the influence of clamping on the impact properties of the laminates. For the \noblique targets, the target was mounted at 45\u00b0 from the horizontal (see Figure 1). The \nprojectile was mounted in a sabot that was stripped away before it struck the target. \n \nFigure 1 \n \nThe energy transferred to the panel was assessed by measuring the impact \nvelocity and the exit velocity of the projectile to an accuracy of <1 % using a high speed \nvideo camera (Phantom 7) at 18,000 pictures-per-second with an exposure time of 2 \u03bcs. \nThe energy transferred to the target (Et) was calculated from  \n \n( )22\n2\n1\nript vvmE \u2212=        (1) \n \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 7\nwhere mp is the mass of the projectile, and vi and vr are the impact and residual velocities. \nConsequently, the percentage change in kinetic energy (\u0394Ef) was calculated using \n \n100\u00d7=\u0394\ni\nt\nf E\nEE        (2) \n \nwhere Ei is the kinetic energy of the projectile prior to impact. \n \nParallax was taken into account by knowing the distances from the lens to the axis \nof penetration and from the axis of penetration to fiduciary markers. Debris that was \nejected from the targets was recovered using multiple layers of cotton cloth. \nThe extent of damage in the perforated composites was assessed by doing C-scans \nusing a glass reflector technique with a 5MHz, 50mm crystal focus transducer. The scans \nwere carried out by Midas NDT Systems Ltd. using a 1 mm grid and a scan speed of 100 \nmm\/s. \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nChange in energy \n \nThe change in the kinetic energy (KE) for the 3 mm and 6 mm targets is shown below in \nFigure 2. A third order polynomial is fitted to all data except the 3 mm normal incidence \nresults. In only one case the projectile did not perforate but rebounded from the target. \nThis occurred for the 6 mm oblique shot with an impact velocity of 194 m\/s (135 J) and is \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 8\nhighlighted by the grey shaded symbol. It rebounded from the target with a kinetic energy \nof 1.8 J and is included in this work for completeness.  \n \nFigure 2 \n \nThere are four things to note here. \nFirstly, two projectiles were shot at the 6 mm asymmetric panels from a different \naspect to test the effect of the lay-up of the target on its ballistic performance. From these \nresults (the grey diamonds in Figure 2) the effect of the lay-up on the ballistic \nperformance is negligible. Tanabe et al [9] have shown that small differences in ballistic \nperformance are possible if carbon fibres of different properties are used in the through-\nthickness of the sample. They also noted that there was little difference in the absorbed \nenergy when cross ply laminates were compared to woven laminates. This may suggest \nthat the structure of the CFRP is of secondary importance when compared to the fibre \nproperties. However, Hammond et al [8] showed that thin laminates of different cross-ply \nlay-ups did exhibit a difference in energy absorption. However, they do note that the \nmeasured difference was small and was well within their experimental error. \nSecondly, the percentage of kinetic energy absorbed reduces with increasing \nkinetic energy of the projectile. This has been observed by other researchers studying \nthese types of materials [9] and is due, in part, to the change in penetration mechanism of \nthe projectile from that of causing petalling where the fibre tows are loaded in tension, to \ncausing compression \/ shear failure in the target. For the normal incidence targets it was \nevident that at lower velocities the failure is dominated by petalling (see Figure 3) \nwhereas at higher velocities the failure of the target is dominated by plug formation. This \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 9\nbehavior has been shown by a number of previous researchers [7,9,14] and will be \ndiscussed in detail in the next section.  \n \nFigure 3 \n \nThirdly, the oblique targets appear to perform better than targets impacted at \nnormal incidence. This is a common feature when projectiles are fired at metallic targets. \nHowever, this is merely an effect of the increase of material thickness offered to the \nprojectile as the angle of obliquity is increased.  In Figure 4, we have plotted the KE \ntransferred to the target normalized by the thickness of material offered to the projectile \nwith impact energy. For the oblique targets the linear thickness offered to the projectile is \ncalculated by t \/ cos\u03b8 where t is the thickness of the CFRP specimen and \u03b8 is the angle of \nobliquity, 45\u00b0 in this case. For both thicknesses of target at a given impact energy, the \nkinetic energy transferred per effective linear thickness offered to the projectile is \nconsistent regardless of whether the penetration occurs at normal incidence or oblique \nincidence. Consequently, over the impact velocity range of interest, for both targets, the \noblique angle does not have any further effect on the resistance to penetration other than \noffering more material to penetrate. There is one further thing to note from this Figure: \nthe 6 mm CFRP panels provide better resistance to penetration per unit thickness of \nmaterial than the 3 mm panels at the lower impact energies. When the velocity of impact \nis increased the difference between the two panels effectively vanishes. This may well be \ndue to the importance of petalling in the 6 mm target and the resulting energy absorption \ndue to delamination. For thicker targets more layers are bent in the petalling process and \nconsequently it is harder for the projectile to push the petals away from its path. This \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 10\nleads to higher energy absorption. As petalling becomes less dominant the \u201cadvantage\u201d \nfor the thicker target reduces. \n \nFigure 4 \n \nFinally, three firings into the 6 mm CFRP laminate were conducted using a \ndifferent jig arrangement that clamped the target along one edge only as opposed to two \nedges. This did not affect the results however we have separated these data points from \nthose of the fully-clamped results for clarity. This observation is in keeping with \nCantwell and Morton [7] who have shown that high velocity projectiles induce a \nlocalised response in the composite material. Any flexing of the top of the sample \nafterwards due to being unrestrained at one edge occurred at a very low linear velocity \n(~3-5 m\/s). \n   \nPerforation mechanisms \n \nDifferent perforation mechanisms were observed over the velocity range of \ninterest: perforation dominated by petalling and perforation dominated by plug formation. \nFigure 5 shows the impact, penetration and perforation of a 6 mm target by a steel \nsphere that has an impact energy of 125 J (187 m\/s). Here we see that failure is \ndominated by petalling of the rear surface plies (see Figure 3). During the initial stages of \npenetration, bulging of the rear surface is evident. Eventually tensile failure of the rear \nplies ensues and the projectile is able to perforate. The petals that are formed are pushed \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 11\napart by the projectile and eventually relax, partially closing up the penetration cavity. It \nwas evident that relatively few fragments were formed as the projectile exits the target. \nFigure 6 shows the penetration of a 6 mm CFRP laminate by a projectile that has \nan impact energy of 450 J (354 m\/s).  On impact a significant amount of delamination \nand fibre breakage occurs. A plug is pushed ahead of the projectile and maintains a \nsimilar velocity to the projectile as it moves away from the rear of the target. \nFigure 5 \n \nFigure 6 \n \nFigure 7 \n \nFigure 7 shows evidence contrasting the damage mechanisms for the 6 mm targets \nshown in the high speed video images in Figures 5 and 6. In  Figure 7(a), the projectile \nhas perforated the target; the penetration channel is not visible due to the relaxation of the \nplies. In Figure 7(b) the penetration has been dominated by plugging and consequently \nthe penetration channel is visible. \nOther researchers have also observed plug formation during the penetration of \nCFRP materials. Li and Sun [15] noted plug formation in thin CFRP laminates that had \nbeen struck by a blunt-ended projectile at relatively low velocities (<100 m\/s). Cantwell \nand Morton [16] have previously shown that during the perforation of a thin CFRP \nmaterial, a frustum\u2013shaped fracture zone is formed. This observation is consistent with \nthe conically shaped plugs that we soft-captured. A recovered plug is shown below in \nFigure 8. The white arrows indicate examples of relatively sharp fracture surfaces at the \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 12\ntop of the plug whereas towards the bottom of the plug the fractured tows show jagged \nedges consistent with tensile failure resulting in fibre pull-out. An example is shown in \nthe white oval. Simultaneous shear failure of the front tows with tensile failure of the rear \nlayers is not possible unless dishing is occurring in the sample. That is, as the projectile \npenetrates the initial plies are subjected to a shearing mechanism whilst the rear part of \nthe laminate is deforming in a dished fashion. There is evidence of this from the high \nspeed photography (see Figure 9).  Eventually, the state of tension in the dished portion \nof the sample leads to tensile failure of the tows. An initial shear failure close to the \nimpact surface followed by a tensile failure of the fibres towards the rear of the sample \nhas also been observed by Cantwell and Morton [16] with thick (8 mm) laminates struck \nwith high velocity spheres. However, they did not report the recovery of a plug in this \ninstance. Given that the recovered plugs in this trial were nominally 5 mm thick for the 6 \nmm CFRP laminates and the observed dishing in the high speed video, we believe that  \nthe combined shear \/ tensile failure is a reasonable assessment of the penetration \nmechanism in these woven laminates. \n \nFigure 8 \nFigure 9 \n \nFor the 6 mm CFRP panels, a plug was also formed when the projectile impacted \nthe target with an energy of 359 J. However at 211 J, it was unclear from the high speed \nvideo as to whether plugging was occurring; no penetration channel was evident when \nthe target was viewed from the impact face. Consequently, it is likely that the penetration \nmechanism undergoes a transition from a mechanism dominated by petalling at 125 J to \n5mm \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 13\none that is dominated by plug formation at 359 J. Similar behaviour occurred with the 3 \nmm CFRP targets. At lower impact velocities, post mortem analysis revealed that \npetalling had occurred for the energies of impact of 103 J and 155 J; in these cases, no \nclear penetration channel was visible. When the energy of impact was increased to 303 J, \na clear penetration channel was evident and thin plug was recovered. \n \nThe effect of obliquity on perforation \n \nFor the 3 mm and 6 mm oblique targets it was unclear from the high speed video \nas to whether plugging was occurring. This was due to the fact that during the early \nstages of the projectile exiting the rear of the target, it was obscured by CFRP debris. \nHowever, it is clear that during penetration, a large amount of debris is ejected in a \ngeneral direction perpendicular to the rear of the target (see the white arrows in Figure \n10). The projectile\u2019s course was altered very little by the oblique CFRP panel. \n \nFigure 10 \n \nWith the 3 mm oblique targets there was no visible change to the penetration \nchannel within the velocity of interest. However, for the 6 mm target, it was apparent that \nperforation did not occur at the lowest velocity of impact tested (194 m\/s = 135 J). \nHowever, increasing the impact velocity to 226 m\/s ( 183 J) resulted in perforation.  \nFigure 11 shows the initial stages of penetration for a 3 mm and 6 mm CFRP laminate \nbeing penetrated by the steel projectile. Impact energies are 129 J (190 m\/s) and 135 J \n(194 m\/s) respectively. During the initial stages, bulging occurs in a direction \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 14\nperpendicular to the rear face of the target until the rear face fractures due to the \npenetrating projectile. Consequently, what appear to be petals are broken off and pushed \nahead of the projectile. For the 6 mm case, the projectile did not perforate. Nevertheless, \nthe high-speed video revealed that the initial stages of penetration, at least, appear to \noccur in a similar fashion. The rear face of the 6 mm target was petalled (see Figure \n12(e)) with tears appearing in a Latin-cross-like fashion whereas with the 3 mm thick \nsample (Figure 12(a)) a hole was left. Given that we observed the bulging in the high \nspeed video and that the penetration mechanisms initially appear similar to that of the 6 \nmm case, we conclude that the petals have been formed and broken off in this instance.  \n \nFigure 11 \n \nFigure 12 \n \nFor all the targets that were perforated, there did not appear to be a transition in \npenetration mechanism from petalling to plugging. No visible plug was seen on the high \nspeed video nor recovered. Unlike the targets that were orientated at normal incidence, \nthe 3 mm targets exhibited a very clear penetration channel visible throughout the \nvelocity range of interest (see Figure 12(a-d)). For the 6 mm oblique samples, three \ntargets had clear penetration channels for impact energies of 259 J, 360 J and 479 J \n(Figure 12(g-i)). Only one target that was perforated (at 183 J) did not reveal a clear \npenetration channel indicating that the petals that were formed relaxed after projectile \nperforation (Figure 12f). \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 15\nThe fracture surface of the 6 mm oblique CFRP impacted at 479 J (366 m\/s) is \nexhibited in Figure 13 where the upper section of the panel is shown on the left and the \nlower section is on the right. For all the oblique panels where perforation occurred, the \nlower section showed a clean fracture of the different layers whereas on the top section, a \nbrush-like surface was observed (see also Figure 12). Due to the obliquity of the \ncomposite panels, the fracture of the material by the projectile was asymmetrical: shear \nfailure of the laminae and fibres appeared to dominate on the lower side, while tensile \nforces appear to dominate on the upper section resulting in greater delamination in this \narea.  \nFor the 3 mm oblique targets, an open hole similar to the one in the 6 mm oblique \ntargets  was created in all the panels with similar fracture characteristics in the upper and \nlower sections (see Figure 12).  \n      \nFigure 13 \n \nDamage assessment \n \nTo elucidate the degree of damage further, sections of the perforated CFRP panel \nwere mounted in polyester mounting resin, ground, polished and then viewed under an \noptical microscope. Delamination and matrix cracks were seen between the different \nlaminates but also between different fibre tows: between the +45\u00b0 and the -45\u00b0 tows in \nthe \u00b145\u00b0 laminates, and between the 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 tows in the 0\/90 laminates. Cracks were \nalso observed to have propagated across and along fibre tows (see Figure 14). \n \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 16\nFigure 14 \n  \nThe targets were C-scanned to examine the extent of the damage to the panels. An \nimage analyzer program was used to measure the damage zone when the signal \nattenuation was greater than 5dB. For the targets impacted at a velocity close to the \nminimum required to perforate the target, the cavity had partially closed therefore giving \na misleading representation of the size of the penetration channel. Consequently, the \nresults presented in Figure 15 include the hole size and represent the total area of damage.  \nIt was noted that in the majority of the normal incidence impact cases the area of \ndelamination was mostly circular. However, for the obliquely impacted samples, the C-\nscans revealed that the delamination was greater at the top of the penetration channel. \nFigure 15 summarises the results. \n Figure 15 \n \nDespite the fact that we must be cautious in drawing too many conclusions from \nthese results due to the fact that these scans provide a two-dimensional view of damage \ninstead of a full three-dimensional picture, there are a number of observations to note \nhere. Firstly, for the 6 mm target that has been struck at normal incidence, the damaged \narea reduces when the impact energy is increased from 125 J to 211 J. Similar behaviour \nhas been reported by Tanabe  et al [9] and Lopez-Puente  et al [14] for relatively thin \nlaminates. For these relatively thick 6 mm laminates, the drop-off in the area of \ndelamination can be explained in terms of the transition from petalling type failure to that \nof penetration dominated by plugging behaviour. However, as we have previously noted, \nno intact plug was recovered at an impact energy of 211 J.  To elucidate this behaviour \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 17\nfurther, two targets were sectioned, mounted in polyester resin, ground and polished to \ninterrogate the level of delamination through the thickness using an optical microscope. \nThe targets chosen represented cases where purely petalling type failure had occurred and \nwhere a plug formation was clearly evident from the high-speed video. To visualize the \nthrough-depth damage, the degree of cracking was traced and is shown schematically in \nFigure 16 for impact energies 125 J and 333 J. Interestingly we see that for the panel that \nhas been perforated by a relatively low velocity projectile, damage is more extensive \ntowards the rear of the target and cracking extends much further than is observed in a \ntarget that has been perforated by a higher velocity projectile. This is consistent with \nextensive dishing that occurs prior to tensile failure of the petals. Consequently, the \nreduction of damage observed by the C-scans is indicative of a change in penetration \nmechanisms as the projectile perforates the target.  In both examples it is clear that the \nlevel of damage increases through the thickness. \n Secondly, the damage area in the 6 mm oblique targets also decreases with \nincreasing impact energy however suffers greater delamination than the 6 mm normal \nincidence results. We believe that the greater level delamination at oblique angles is due \nto the geometry of penetration. In the early stages of penetration, deformation occurred in \na direction perpendicular to the rear of the target plate as discussed previously (see Figure \n11) and at the lower impact energies resulted in petalling (see Figure 12 (e)). Due to the \neffective linear thickness of penetrated material being higher in the oblique targets than \nthe normal targets and given the perpendicular bulging of the target, a greater volume of \nmaterial was damaged by the projectile. This resulted in a greater measured area of \ndelamination. \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 18\n Thirdly, a similar level of damage is observed with the C-scans and from the \nthrough-thickness analysis for the 6 mm thick asymmetric targets impacted at normal \nincidence regardless of the direction of impact.  Consequently, we conclude that for this \nCFRP laminate, the sequence of lay-up has no effect on the penetration mechanism. \n Fourth, the 3 mm laminates appear to demonstrate similar amounts of \ndelamination regardless of whether the impact was at normal incidence or at an oblique \nangle. This is probably due to the fact that the level of damage has already plateaued \nbefore the minimum impact velocity in these experimental trials. Indeed, Tanabe et al. \n[10] have shown that with their CFRP laminates the drop-off in area damage occurs at an \nimpact energy of 20 J for 4 and 5 mm diameters spheres impacting ~2 mm thick CFRP \npanels. \n Finally, as the impact energy is increased, the area of damage appears to approach \nan asymptotic level for the thicker targets tested. Whereas, for the thinner targets, the \namount of damage appeared to remain constant regardless of impact energy. Given that \nthe percentage change in kinetic energy for all composites reached a plateau in the range \nof impact energies tested (see Figure 2) this may suggest that the main energy absorbing \nmechanism at the higher impact energies is not damage related. This is because at the \nhigher impact energies the percentage of energy absorbed increases with impact energy \nwhilst the level of damage remains constant. One probable cause of the observed effect is \nthat more energy is being transferred to the debris in the form of kinetic energy. \nHowever, further work at higher impact velocities is required to elucidate this matter. \n \n \nFigure 16 \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 19\n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nA series of impact experiments have been conducted on 3 mm and 6 mm thick \nwoven carbon-fibre laminates at normal and oblique impact angles and the failure \nmechanisms, degree of damage, and energy transferred to the plate have been discussed. \nAt lower impact velocities it was noted that with the 6 mm panel, the penetration \nmechanism was dominated by the tensile failure of the rear weave and the consequent \npetalling. As the velocity of impact was increased from 170 m\/s, a conical mass of \nlaminate was ejected. Despite the energy transferred to the plate increasing with impact \nenergy, the degree of delamination for the 6 mm targets, as measured by C-scan and by \nmicroscope observations, decreased and we conclude that this was due to the change in \npenetration mechanism from that of petalling to plugging. Eventually, the degree of \ndelamination appeared to approach an asymptotic level.  For the 3 mm targets, the degree \nof delamination remained constant regardless of impact energy. \nA similar level of energy absorption and damage was observed for the 6 mm thick \nasymmetric targets impacted at normal incidence regardless of the direction of impact.  \nConsequently, we conclude that for this CFRP laminate, the sequence of lay-up has no \neffect on the panel\u2019s impact properties and on the penetration mechanism. \nFor the targets that have been impacted at an oblique angle more of the kinetic \nenergy is transferred from the projectile when compared to the same thickness of target \nthat has been subjected to a normal incidence impact. However, we have shown that this \nis merely due to a geometrical effect. We have also shown that thicker panels appear to \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 39 (5), pp. 866-874 (2008)  \n 20\nbehave more efficiently by absorbing more kinetic energy per effective linear thickness at \nthe lower impact energies where petalling is a dominant factor in the penetration. This \nadvantage appears to vanish as the impact energy is increased. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThe authors would like to thank Mr Keith Campbell of Short Brothers plc, \nBelfast, UK for supplying the CFRP panels.
