All have research interests within the field of sustainability and public \npolicy. \n 3 \nINTRODUCTION \nWithin tourism literature it has been widely-documented that urban tourism has been \ncontinually neglected as an area of research (Ashworth 1989), and consequently remains \ndevoid of a developed understanding or research base (Law 1993; Page 1995).  One of the \nexplanations for this is that the uniqueness of individual cities makes reliable comparisons \ndifficult, with a sizeable portion of the literature centered on individual case studies.  Thus, this \nstudy responds to the call for the development of valid and reliable studies supported by \nlongitudinal and comparative data collection techniques.  The authors feel that research into \nsocial impact assessment has jumped too quickly from description to modeling and there is \nneed to conduct studies that will provide longitudinal and comparative data.  It was felt that \nwithout an approach of this nature, any proposed understanding would merely add to the \nfragmented picture of urban tourism research.  Hence, the purpose of this study is to identify \nand examine the attitudes of residents in Bath, UK towards tourism development and the paper \naims to establish a benchmark study for Bath, enabling future longitudinal and comparative \nanalyses of host attitudes.  It is also anticipated that future comparative analysis with other \nhistoric cities could establish a basis for theory development and the development of flexible \nmodeling tools regarding the social impacts of tourism on residents of historic and related cities \nin the United Kingdom. \n \nSOCIAL IMPACTS OF TOURISM IN BATH \nBath was the thriving center of the spa business as long ago as in Roman times.  It \nbecame a popular tourist center during the 17th and 18th centuries, during which time it was \nroutinely included in the social round.  During these times Bath was still very much a medieval \ntown, enclosed by its wall, and possessing narrow streets (Havins 1976).  Bath became more of \na 'classical' city during the late 18th Century when it was elevated to the position of the most \nfashionable city in England. \n 4 \n \nThe architects of this development in the fortunes of Bath were heavily influenced in their \ndesigns by the Greeks and Romans.  Indeed, John Wood's realization of Bath as a Roman city \non English soil is his greatest claim to fame.  Although much of his plan was never realized, \nWoods' work laid the foundation for Bath, the Georgian city that became England's off-duty \ncapital and the model for other spa resort towns.  Interestingly, Havins (1976) speculates that it \nwas no more than a series of historical accidents that led to Bath becoming the chosen site.  \nAlthough Bath was accepted as a London-in-the-West, it possessed little on the lines of \nmonumental London other than its Abbey.  Bath was in no better state than many other English \ntowns of that time, and the conditions were aggravated by a growing annual inflow of tourists. \nThe town was still fairly prosperous as a result of its connection with the wool-trade, although \nthis too was in decline.  Indeed, it was its developing recognition as a spa resort that fashioned \nits development which underpins its acceptance today as a notable tourist attraction. Bath's \ncustodianship of several historic attractions, most notably its Roman Baths, and dominant \nGeorgian architecture, have contributed to Bath becoming a UNESCO designated World \nHeritage Site. \n \nPresent-day Bath has a population of approximately 85,000, 52% of which is female.  Its \nthree largest employers are the Ministry of Defence, the Health Authority and the Bath and \nNorth East Somerset Council.  The 2001 census indicated that 15-24 year olds represented \n13% of the Bath and North East Somerset population; 25-34 year olds 13%; 35-44 year olds \n14%; 45-pensionable age represented 24%; pensioners under 75 9%; and pensioners over 75 \nrepresented 9% (Census 2001; 2003).  The 1991 census noted an increase in the number of \npeople working in the service sector (+ 26%, 1981-1991 NOMIS\/Census of employment) with \napproximately 40% of the working population working in 'Other services.'  Relatedly, the Bath \nTourism Bureau recognizes the value of tourism as an increasingly important element of local \n 5 \neconomic activity.  In 2001 the estimated value of tourism to the city was US$357 million, with \n2.7 million day tourists and 937,000 overnight tourists (Bath Tourism Bureau, 2003).   \n \nSocial Impacts  \nThe literature has given tourism impact extensive treatment.  The reason for this \nattention is the inevitability that the industry induces impacts, both beneficial and adverse.  \nTourism is seen as an economic tool of development (Gee, Choy and Makens 1989) and many \nof the economic benefits associated can be measured objectively and serve as support for \nfurther development (Cohen 1972).  However, the social impacts appear to be somewhat more \nsubjective and intangible.   \n \nOver the past 25 years North American research has examined many different aspects \nrelated to residents' perceptions of tourism development.  Pizam (1978) suggested that heavy \nconcentration has led to the emergence of negative host attitudes.  Rothman (1978) highlighted \nnegative resident perceptions towards increased noise, litter, traffic, crime, over-crowding, and \ntourism induced price increases, although research findings also noted the perception of \npositive aspects of tourism development. These included improvements in local infrastructure \n(Belisle and Hoy 1980), increased employment opportunities (Milman and Pizam 1988; \nRothman 1978), and increased recreational opportunities (Davis, Allen and Cosenza 1988).  \nOther significant findings include the personal and demographic factors known to influence \nattitudes and perceptions, such as distance of residence from the central tourist zone (Belisle \nand Hoy 1980), the influence of one's length of residence in the community (Liu and Var 1986) \nand age, as in the case of Bastias-Perez and Var's (1996) study in Darwin, Australia.  \n \nThe majority of research into residents' perceptions of tourism development has \naddressed only small, rural, or resort-type communities.  This has been the focus in the United \n 6 \nStates (Davis et al 1988; Liu and Var 1986; Milman and Pizam 1988; Perdue et al 1990; Pizam \n1978; Rothman 1978; Thomason, Crompton and Kamp 1979) in Europe (Var, Kendall and \nTarakcioglu 1985), and in the United Kingdom (Brougham and Butler 1981; Sheldon and Var \n1984).  Research into perceptions in larger urban areas has been relatively ignored, but the \nresearch conducted is summarized in Table 1.  \n \nWhile the research conducted has made a significant step towards better understanding \nof the relationship between positive and negative perceptions of tourism and support for specific \ntourism-related policies, historically most of the research on the topic of residents' perceptions \nhas been atheoretical in nature (Ap 1990).  The dominant theory to emerge to shape \nunderstanding has been social exchange theory, which concentrates on the extent to which \nresidents receive something for the imposition the industry places upon them.  Recent research \non this subject in Ghana (Sirakaya, Teye and Sonmez 2002) shows that it is not simply the \nexistence of an exchange that is important, but the nature and value of the exchange that \ninfluences attitudes and perceptions.  Hence, traditional social exchange theory would hold that \nif someone is employed within the tourism industry then that person would be expected to hold \na positive attitude towards the industry.  However, if the experience of employment within the \nindustry was negative, then this would shape his\/her attitude and result in a negative attitude \ntowards the industry as a whole.   \n \nIn addition to the lack of underpinning theory, the choice of different methodologies in \nexamining perceptions has resulted in a fragmented rather than coherent view. Sampling \nmethodology used in the studies varies and sample sizes vary considerably. Descriptions \nprovided of the sampling plans have been generally limited, and the information provided does \nnot allow readers to make judgments about the appropriateness and adequacy of the sampling \nplan. The apparent lack of attention to sampling methodology calls into question the validity of \n 7 \nthe reported findings, and future studies should avoid this problem.  The weakest aspect of the \ndata characteristics of the early research is that few studies (Sethna and Richmond 1978) report \nany tests of the reliability and validity of the measures used in the survey instrument.  Babbie \n(1986) highlighted the importance of reliable and valid measures to sound research, and more \nexplicit consideration by researchers regarding this matter is needed in the future.  \n \nThe use of statistical techniques to analyze residents' perceptions data also varies \nconsiderably from study to study, and thus makes comparisons between them difficult.  As a \npositive exception, Teye, Sonmez and Sirakaya (2002) employ the same methodology in two \ndestinations to enable comparison across towns with differing histories of tourism development.  \nThe multivariate techniques most commonly used have been regression analysis, analysis of \nvariance and factor analysis (Perdue, Long and Allen 1990). The techniques used in the studies \nprovide viable information about the array of techniques that have been employed and may \npossibly lead researchers to consider other alternative techniques in the future. Although not all \nstudies provided justification for the techniques used, Belisle and Hoy (1980), Brougham and \nButler (1981), Sheldon and Var (1984), Liu and Var (1986), Teye, Sonmez and Sirakaya (2002) \nprovided clear and adequate explanations of the techniques used.  The fragmentation of this \nbody of research has been added to by researchers from a number of disciplines examining \nresidents' perceptions.  These disciplines include anthropology (Farrell 1977; Smith 1977), \neconomics (Archer 1973; Liu 1979; Peters 1969), geography (Butler 1974; Keogh 1989; Murphy \n1981), and sociology (Cohen 1978; de Kadt 1979; Turner and Ash 1975). Consequently, there \nhas been scant progress in developing conceptual frameworks. \n \nStudies also need to be considered within the context of the stage at which the discipline \nexists. Moncrief (1970) identified that the early stages of a discipline generally involve \nidentification of the problems, establishment of priorities of need for research inquiry, description \n 8 \nof major variables involved, and development of methodologies for conducting research. \nReported findings are predominantly descriptive, and it could be said that the studies are \nindicative of a field of study that is still in its early stages of development.  \n \nAs a final critique of the social impacts research, most of the studies reviewed made no \nreference to the study's implications for practitioners.  The fact that the studies were locally or \nregionally based would seem to provide the researchers with an opportunity to discuss the \nimplications for practitioners, and demonstrate the relevance of research in addressing practical \nproblems.  Thus, it was disappointing to find only a few studies citing research implications for \npractitioners (Sirakaya, Teye and Sonmez 2002).  In addition to the lack of specific reference to \nimplications for practitioners comes the increasing complexity in language with which the \nfindings of studies are presented.  A challenge for academics the world over is to improve the \ndissemination of studies and to increase the relevance of research conducted, both of which are \nmilitated against by virtue of the complexity of the statistical analysis and its reportage.  Clearly \nthe concerns of Ap (1990) that studies provide details of reliability and validity measures in \naddition to the accurate reporting and description of methodology employed are crucial to the \ndevelopment of understanding.  However, the drive for greater and more detailed understanding \nshould not come at the cost of practitioners and those without statistical expertise being able to \nunderstand what are, after all, impacts on people.  A balance is needed between these two \ncompeting forces.   \n \nInformation about the consequences and impacts of tourism from host residents' \nperspectives is an important factor that needs to be considered in planning.  Irrespective of how \ntourism is introduced and developed in a community, residents are important players who can \ninfluence the success or failure of the local industry.  Residents may contribute to the well- \nbeing of the community through their participation (in varying degrees) in the planning, \n 9 \ndevelopment, and operation of attractions and by extending their hospitality in exchange for the \nbenefits obtained from tourism.  On the other hand, residents may be instrumental in \ndiscouraging the industry by opposing it or exhibiting hostile behavior toward tourism advocates \nand or tourists (Crompton and Ap 1994). In developing and attracting tourism to a community \nthe goal is to achieve outcomes that obtain the best balance of benefits and costs for all key \nplayers involved, that is, residents, tourists and the tourism industry.  This study's longitudinal \nand comparative type of research design may prove to be important in terms of \nexpanding\/deepening management strategies in historic cities, particularly if residents report a \nfiner balance between what they will and will not live with in terms of tourism development.  The \ntotality of these attitudes deserves investigation and documentation along with associated \nresident profile characteristics in order to gain a fuller understanding of this essential component \nof the supply side of the tourism product.  Further, balancing the reportage of the methodology \nwith implications for practitioners will encourage further understanding and comparability of \nfuture studies.   \n \nStudy Methodology  \nThe quantitative methodological approach chosen for this research was a mailed \nquestionnaire to a random sample of the residents of Bath.  It is widely-recognized within the \nresearch literature that the main advantage of using a quantitative approach is that it is possible \nto measure the reactions of a great number of people to a limited set of questions, which \nfacilitates comparison and statistical aggregation of the data (Bell 1992; Preece 1994; Robson \n1993; Veal 1993).  The mail survey is recognized as being a relatively quick and low-cost way of \ncollecting information, which was appropriate given the required sample sizes within Bath.  The \nresearch also sought to enable comparison with the findings of studies already reported in the \nliterature, and while not all of them used mail surveys, this was clearly the preferred method.  \nThere are, however, drawbacks with this method - including the fact that the interviewer is not \n 10 \npresent and therefore the potential for misinterpretation or confusion exists.  This was minimized \nthrough the use of a short and simplified questionnaire consisting of items which had been \npretested by other researchers (Madrigal 1995; Perdue et al 1990).  \n \nAnother potential problem is that of low response rates.  In order to increase the \nresponse rates, Dillman's Total Design Method (1974) was adopted.  Cover letters were \ndesigned, drafted and piloted following the recommendations of Babbie (1992).  \n \nSurvey Instrument  \nThe survey instrument used in this study was comprised of a subset of items developed \nby Perdue et al (1990).  The original instrument was developed for use in rural American \ncommunities in Colorado, and subsequently underwent slight adjustments before being applied \nto historic cities.  These amendments were more contextual than conceptual as the original \nitems were specifically designed to enable hypothesis testing and confirmation of the model.  \nThe instrument consisted of two sections that were retained in the historic cities\u2019 instrument.  \nThe first section included 24 closed-style items and required respondents to rate their level of \nagreement with each item, through indicating their response on a five point Likert scale which \nranged from Strongly disagree (1) to Strongly agree (5).  Each of the items was related to \ngeneral aspects of tourism development. Several of the aspects shared an interest in a \nparticular issue, therefore enabling the creation of subscales.  The additional questionnaire item \nwas related to whether or not residents were positive about tourism when they spoke to each \nother about its presence in the city.  \n \nThe second section sought socioeconomic and demographic information in order to \nverify, as far as possible, the similarity of the study samples to the actual populations of the \nrespective cities. This information was also incorporated in order to investigate whether \n 11 \nsocioeconomic and demographic characteristics were significant in their ability to indicate \ndiffering resident attitudes towards tourism development.  Additional questions were added to \nsection two of the survey in order to identify the number of times residents were entering the city \nto shop, recreate, work - and the average duration of those visits.  In addition, respondents were \nasked to report whether or not they had an ancestral history of residence in the area.  \n  \nThe Sampling Frame  \nSurrounded by remnants of fortified walls the historic city of Bath is physically \ndemarcated from contiguous and related urbanized places and populations.  In order to ensure \nthat each household within the Bath area had an equal chance of being selected to participate \nin the respective studies, a circle, with a radius of four miles, was placed on the official ordnance \nsurvey maps of each city and its respective surrounding areas.  A circle of this size captured the \ncity center, the suburbs and out-lying villages (Snaith and Haley 1994).  When selecting a \nsampling frame there are many alternatives regarding the parameterization of the chosen \npopulation each of which, it could be argued, contain methodological challenges when applied \nacross different populations.  Therefore, while the method may prove successful in one city, it \nmay not necessarily be suited for other historic cities.  \n \nEach grid-referenced square on the map, which lay on the peripheral boundary of the \ncircle, was included if at least 50% of its total area fell within the outer boundary.  Each grid \nsquare that fulfilled this criterion was enumerated.  With this completed, the total sample area \nwas seen to consist of 131 grid squares.  From this sample area, a random number was \nselected between 1 and 131 to be the number of grid squares to be included in the sampling \nframe, this number was 10.  The sampling frame therefore consisted of all residential addresses \nwithin 10 randomly chosen grid squares.  The completion of the sampling was facilitated by the \nuse of the Royal Mails' Postal Address File on compact disc.  The postal address file is a \n 12 \ncomputer enabled grid search, which produces a list of all streets and residential addresses, \nincluding their postal codes, contained within selected areas.  A database was thus compiled \nfrom this information consisting of the 8,431 residential addresses contained within the 10 \nselected grids.  Each address was subsequently numbered.  According to Di Grino (1986), the \nrequired number of responses to achieve a representative sample from a population of 25,000 \nor more individuals is 348.  This figure allows for 95% confidence within +\/- 2.5% margin of \nerror.  The sample size in Bath was 800 to allow for nonresponse experiences.  \n \nThe questionnaires were sent to households selected at random from the residential \naddress file. In order to personalize the survey, the letters were completed with household \nnames.  This information was obtained from the electoral registers held by the Office of National \nStatistics in Titchfield, Hampshire, England.  The final response rate from Bath was 46.4%, with \na total of 368 usable questionnaires.  This exceeds the recommended 348 returns required from \na population the size of Bath's (Di Grino 1986).  \n \nStudy Results  \nThe breakdown of the sample by age groups closely reflected the actual \nsociodemographics of the sample area (OPCS 1993).  The mean age of the sample was 41 \nyears of age, with the majority (79.6%) under the age of sixty.  A larger proportion of \nrespondents fell into the 16-29 age category, indicating a slight over-sampling when compared \nto the census data.  Only 25% of the sample reported having been born in Bath, 67% owned \ntheir own home, and the gender breakdown was 56.2% female, and 43.8% males.  The mean \nfor the length of residence was 24.6 years, with 30.4% of respondents indicating that their family \nhad a history of habitation in the Bath area.  The length of ancestral residence was reported as \n112.8 years (n=107).  In terms of household income, 44.8% of the sample earned less than \nUS$27,480, with the largest category being 27% who earned less than US$18,315.  The \n 13 \nproportion of people who declared that they were employed in the tourism industry was 7.6%, \nwhile 8.7% of respondents felt that tourism was either \"important\" or \"very important\" to their \nemployment.  Having examined the descriptive statistics, the research sought to test the 1st \nhypothesis. \n \nThe 1st hypothesis (Ho): No underlying dimensions will emerge from the analysis of resident \nresponses to tourism development issues within the Bath sample.  \nPrincipal components factor analysis with varimax rotation was conducted on the sample \nin order to test this hypothesis.  Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin statistic of 0.9 and inspection of correlation \namong the items indicated that the data was suitable for a factor analysis.  The conventional \ncriterion for factor analysis is that there should be a minimum of 5 cases per item (Tinsley and \nTinsley 1987).  In this case, with a 24-item questionnaire, that would mean 120 respondents.  \nThis was achieved in the sample.   \n \nFollowing the initial factor extraction process, a varimax rotation was conducted in order \nto make the results more easily interpretable.  This approach was accepted in line with the \nrecommendations of Green et al (1997:352) who state that \"Eigenvalues are helpful in deciding \nhow many factors should be used in the analysis.\u201d  They recommend two accepted practices, \nfirst, retain all factors that have eigenvalues greater than 1, or secondly, retain all factors with \neigenvalues in the sharp descent part of the scree plot.  The second, it is suggested, yields \nmore accurate results, although the factors were in accordance with both tests.    A cut-off point \nof 0.4 was also used to include items in the interpretation of a factor (Teye, Sonmez and \nSirakaya 2002).  This resulted in a two-factor solution being specified (see Table 2) where the \nfirst factor had an eigenvalue of 6.2, while the second factor had an eigenvalue of 1.9. \n \n 14 \nHaving specified the two-factor solution, results indicate that the two domains within the \nsample data signified residents' positive and negative attitudes of tourism development.  The \ntwo factors together accounted for 40% of variance in the Bath data set, with all items loading \non the two domains. The amount of variance explained in the sample is fairly low and, therefore, \nit must be recognized that the factors are not particularly strong.  In addition, it is worth noting \nthat three of the items did not load on the two domains in the sample.  These were: \"I feel that I \ncan personally influence the decision making process associated with tourism development in \nBath,\" \"I would support local tax levies for tourism development\" and an additional question, \n\"When I talk to fellow residents of Bath concerning tourism in the city, I am generally very \npositive.\"  These items are reported in the coefficient's alpha tables with the indication that they \nare not included in the scales. \n  \nHaving established the existence of these two domains, it remained to test for internal \nconsistency among each of the items within each of the domains.  This was accomplished by \ncomputing Cronbach's coefficient alpha's which indicate the degree of item-total correlation.  \nThis is an important stage as the results will establish whether or not it is acceptable to use the \ntwo domains as variables in later stages of the analysis (see Table 2).  The items in each \ndomain possessed item-total correlations ranging from .41 to .73 (Positive), and .40 to .68 \n(Negative).  The data confirmed that the items did belong to the domains to which they were \nassigned, and that the scales were internally consistent.  In answering hypothesis 1, the null \nhypothesis was rejected establishing that two underlying dimensions emerge from the analysis.  \n \nWhile it is intuitive to build the presentation of the results, it is important to ascertain the \nreliability of the items within their associated domains before reporting the mean scores for each \nscale item.  Further, as the purpose of this paper is to promote understanding about the social \nimpacts in Bath, the mean scores represent a key statistic whose value and importance should \n 15 \nnot be overlooked simply because they are a descriptive statistic.  Table 3 presents these mean \nscores for the impact statements faced by respondents.   \n \nThe next stage of analysis investigates whether or not residents' socioeconomic and \ndemographic characteristics, economic reliance and positive and negative perceptions are \nuseful predictors of their attitudes regarding tourism development issues. In order to achieve \nthis, the socioeconomic and demographic profiles of the respondents were entered as \nindependent variables in a series of hierarchical regression equations.  Hierarchical regression \nwas used following the example of Madrigal (1993) in order to test the relative contribution of \nvariable sets.  This approach enables each variable set to have a voice before consolidation \nwithin the overall model.   This procedure was conducted in order to test the 2nd hypothesis. \n \nThe 2nd Null Hypothesis (Ho): It is not possible to predict residents' attitudes of tourism \ndevelopment according to their socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, economic \nreliance and negative and positive perceptions of tourism. \n \nA series of seven hierarchical regression equations were computed for Bath and are \nshown in Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7. The dependent variables were specifically selected to assess \nfirstly, whether residents' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, economic reliance \nand positive and negative attitudes are good predictors of community support for the industry \n\"...should become more of a tourist destination\" \"... should try to attract more tourists\" \"tourism \nshould play a vital part in the future of the city\" (Regression #1, 2, 3); secondly if residents' \nsocioeconomic and demographic characteristics, economic reliance and positive and negative \nattitudes are good predictors of community opposition to the industry \"local government should \nrestrict tourism development\" (Regression #4); thirdly if residents' socioeconomic and \ndemographic characteristics, economic reliance and positive and negative attitudes are good \n 16 \npredictors of the degree to which people feel that they are involved in the decisions made \nregarding tourism development in their city \"I feel that I can personally influence the decision-\nmaking process associated with tourism development in...\" (Regression #5); fourthly, whether \nresidents' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, economic reliance and positive and \nnegative attitudes are good predictors of either their positive, or negative attitudes of tourism \n(Regression #6, 7).  \n \nInsert Table 4 Here  \n \nThe Gauss-Markov assumptions of regression check was conducted to check for \nnormality, homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices, multicolinearity and linearity.  No \nassumptions of regression were contravened.  The results of the first hierarchical regression \nanalysis (Regression #1) indicated that the equation contained a valid set of explanatory \nvariables.  The explanation of total variance in the model (adjusted R2) reached 60%. \n \nResults of the significance of resident characteristics, economic reliance and positive \nand negative attitudes on predicting attitudes regarding specific tourism related issues indicated \nthat resident characteristics are not predictive of attitudes on this issue, although economic \nreliance is (R2-07; p<.001).  Again, the positive scale offers the greatest contribution to the \nexplanation of variance (R2-57; p<.001), whilst the negative scale also offers a significant \ndegree of explanation (R2 change=.03; p<.001).  These results suggest that as positive attitudes \nincrease and the negative ones decrease, they are increasingly supportive of Bath developing \nfurther as a tourist destination. \n \nThe second hierarchical regression (Regression #2) again sought to investigate an \naspect of support for tourism.  This time, it was the question of whether or not Bath should try to \n 17 \nattract more tourists.  As with regression #1, the regression equations achieved reasonable \nlevels of explanation, these being 47% of adjusted R2.  Resident characteristics are seen to be \ninsignificant as a group, but economic reliance is significant (R2=.04; p<.01), while the positive \nscale makes the largest contribution (R2=.41; p<.001) and the negative attitudes scale account \nfor additional explanation of variance (R2 change=.06; p<.001). \n \nThe third series of hierarchical regressions (Regression #3) were designed to investigate \nwhether or not resident characteristics, economic reliance and positive and negative attitudes \ncould indicate support for tourism playing a vital part in the future of Bath.  These independent \nvariables accounted for 65% of variance within the equations.  Again, support was evident from \nwithin the communities.  Resident characteristics were once more found to be insignificant, \neconomic reliance was significant (R2=.09; p<.001), the positive attitudes scale was significant \n(R2=.65; p<.001), and the negative attitudes scale was insignificant in its contribution to the \nexplanation of variance. \n \nThe fourth set of hierarchical regressions (Regression #4) sought to investigate support \nfor local government restrictions on tourism development.  The equations accounted for 44% of \nvariance.  Resident characteristics were again insignificant, while economic reliance was \nsignificant (R2=.06; p<.01).  The results for the positive attitudes scale were significant in the \nsample, indicating that as positive attitudes decreased, the support for local government \nrestrictions on tourism development increased.  In support of this the opposite was true of the \nnegative attitudes when they increased, so too did the support for local government restrictions. \n \nThe fifth hierarchical regressions (Regression #5) related to the extent that residents felt \nthey could personally influence decisions associated with tourism development in their city.  The \nindependent variables performed poorly, accounting for only 8% of the total variance.  With this \n 18 \nin mind, results indicated that resident characteristics were significant in Bath (R2=.04; p<.05), \nwith those living a great distance away from the centre reporting a greater sense of influence \nover the decision-making process. Economic reliance was not a significant contributor to the \nexplanation of variance.  The positive scale was seen to be significant (R2 change=.03; p<.01), \nwhile the negative scale was insignificant in its ability to predict attitudes to the degree to which \nthey felt that they could influence the decision-making process. \n \nThe underlying positive and negative attitude dimensions appeared to be effective in \npredicting support, or otherwise, for tourism development.  Thus, two additional hierarchical \nregression equations (Regressions #6 and 7) were conducted to investigate whether positive or \nnegative attitudes were stronger within distinct sections of the populations.  The regression \nequation (#6) explained 40% of the variance.  Resident characteristics proved to be significant \nin their ability to explain the variance in positive attitudes within the city samples.  In Bath \n(R2=.04; p<.05) the length of residence was again the greatest contributor to the overall \nexplanation of variance. \n \nFinally, (Regression #7) residents\u2019 characteristics were significant in Bath (R2=.03; <.05) \nas was economic reliance significant in its predictive contribution within the sample (R2=.08; \np<.001).  Hence, it was the importance which people perceived tourism had relative to their \noccupation that was the greatest contributor. \n \nThe inclusion of the negative attitude's scale was intended to act as a check on the data \nresponses of residents.  It would make sense that their positive responses would be \ndiametrically opposed to their negative responses.  This is apparent in Table 7, where negative \nattitudes are significant (p<.001) in their ability to predict positive attitudes.  The direction of the \n 19 \nregression coefficients shows that as negative attitudes decrease, positive attitudes increase.  \nThe regression equation explained 36% of the variance in the sample. \n \nIn answering the second hypothesis, the results of the seven hierarchical regressions \nenable rejection of the null hypothesis since socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, \neconomic reliance and negative and positive attitudes of tourism were found to indicate differing \nlevels of support and opposition to tourism development.  Residents' characteristics were \nsignificant in predicting negative attitudes in Bath, with those born in the city indicating the \ngreatest contribution.  Economic reliance made a contribution to understanding negative \nattitudes of tourism in Bath.  Residents' positive attitudes are significant in their ability to predict \nnegative attitudes.  The direction of the regression coefficients shows that as positive attitudes \ndecrease, negative attitudes increase.  These results indicate the potential for predicting \nattitudes of tourism development in historic cities according to certain resident characteristics. \n \nFindings and Discussion: Impacts in Historic Cities  \nAs was initially stated, the purpose of this research is to examine residents' attitudes of \ntourism development in the historic city of Bath, England.  As a consequence, the research aims \nto establish a benchmark study for Bath, enabling future longitudinal and comparative analyses \nof host attitudes.  The subsequent analysis of the results enabled the answering of the two \nhypotheses and provides a sound foundation for recommendations regarding a practical way \nforward for Bath as well as making theoretical contributions for future social impact assessment \nstudies more widely.   \n \nThe first contribution this paper is able to make is to the discussion raised by previous \nresearch studies suggesting that a two-factor structure existed, which indicated positive and \nnegative dimensions (Kim 1992; Madrigal 1993; Perdue et al 1990; Snaith and Haley 1994).  \n 20 \nResults from this research confirm these observations with a two-factor structure apparent from \nthe sample.  This enables the rejection of the first null hypothesis and establishes consistency in \nthe use of this research approach with previous studies.  There has, however, been criticism of \nthis approach (Ap and Crompton 1998) supported by the discovery of another four potential \ndimensions; crowding and congestion, services, taxes and community attitude.  While this new \napproach is welcomed, the continual development of new instrumentation carries with it an \nimportant implication.  Increasing the understanding of the underlying dimensions is an \nimportant step forward, but it must be remembered that consistent longitudinal data enables the \ndevelopment of potentially greater insight.  In order to trace the changing nature of residents' \nattitudes, and compare them alongside developments in tourism and its planning within a \ndestination, some degree of continuity must exist which acts as a baseline for reference.  It is \nsuggested that there is a place for several different approaches that either possess the potential \nfor comparative analysis or seek to drive more specific understanding.   \n \nSecond, the group of variables associated with economic reliance proved consistently \npredictive of support for tourism development.  These variables support the consistent research \nfinding that those who perceive that they may, or actually do, benefit economically are more \nsupportive of further tourism development (Perdue et al., 1990).  Interestingly, it was found that \nas income level fell, the residents were more likely to support increased tourism, and those with \nthe lower incomes were more likely to accept their city becoming more of a tourist destination.  \nThis is further reinforced by the finding that those employed in the industry were more \nsupportive of their city becoming more of a tourist destination.  Hence, tourism may be seen as \na source of low income employment, which has important implications for developing the image \nof the industry.  It would appear from the data that at present those who receive economic \nsupport from the industry are grateful for that support, in adherence with conventional social \nexchange theory.  However, should wages in tourism begin to fall relative to those enjoyed by \n 21 \nthe rest of the city, then it might be reasonable to expect even those economically reliant on \ntourism to become resentful of the industry.  To the concept of social exchange theory might \nusefully be added the work of Adams\u2019 equity theory, (Adams 1963) which argues that the \nsatisfaction displayed depends on the extent to which a person feels they are treated fairly.  \nHence, social exchange theory relies not just on the existence of an exchange, but the relative \nperceived fairness of that exchange.   \n \nMuch of the early literature debated the potential for using socioeconomic and \ndemographic variables as indicators of differing attitudes and perceptions of tourism (Pizam \n1978; Rothman 1978) and this debate has continued, with a great deal of disagreement, \nthroughout the past twenty years.  The reason for this may well lie in the limited attempts by \nresearch groups to define the type of destination, utilize the same methodology, and develop \nmodels which are broad enough to contain all of the potentially contributory variables.  Thus, \nresearchers can rarely state with confidence whether or not socioeconomic and demographic \nvariables are significant indicators of distinct attitudes. \n \nResults of this survey of Bath enable the rejection of the 2nd null hypothesis, suggesting \nthat some of the variables may indeed provide the basis for a general understanding of which \npeople are more susceptible to perceiving certain impacts of tourism.  Further studies in Bath in \nthe future, or more widely in other historic cities must ask whether socioeconomic and \ndemographic characteristics act as useful predictors of residents' attitudes.   For practitioners \nsuch as town planners, understanding the effects of socioeconomic and demographic variables \nwould be most useful, since they could then hypothesize regarding likely reactions of the \nresident population to future planning actions.  However, currently there is an insufficient body \nof longitudinal and comparative research concerning specific destinations to enable those \ngeneral predictions.   \n 22 \n \nAs a fourth contribution, it was found in Bath that those people living closer to the central \ntourism zone were more supportive of restrictions.  Belisle and Hoy (1980) in their study of \nSanta Marta, Colombia first observed the distance of residence from the central zone as a \nsignificant variable.  However, in their research the opposite was found \u2013 that those living closer \nwere less positive and supportive than those living further away.  This was seen as being due to \nthe incipient stage of development present at that time.  It may well be, therefore, that later on in \nthe life cycle of the destination those living closer to the main tourism zones become \nincreasingly impacted by the pressure of increasing numbers on the local infrastructure.  \nHistoric cities in the UK often face unique pressures in that the design of the city means narrow \nstreets with residential areas inter mixed with what have subsequently become tourist \nattractions.  Further research is needed to identify whether the attitude displayed by residents of \nBath is due to the stage of tourism development, or to being resident in historic cities.  Similarly, \nthis research has found that those people who were born in the city appeared more likely to \nnotice the negative impacts of tourism.   \nOppositely, the shorter the lengths of residence, the more positively residents see the \nimpacts of tourism.  Thus, those who have recently moved to the city may be at an earlier stage \nin their exposure to the significant tourist numbers Bath receives and thus maintain a more \npositive view of tourism than those who have been exposed for longer.  Alternatively, Bath is a \nrelatively affluent part of the country and it is reasonable to expect those who have been born in \nthe city have greater resources available than those who have more recently moved to the city.  \nSuch a theory would fit with the finding that those on lower incomes were more supportive of the \ntourism industry.  Further research is necessary to determine whether this is typical of other \nhistoric cities or unique to Bath.  \nFinally, residents' perceived level of influence on the decision-making process did not \nload on any of the dimensions in the earlier stages of the research and, again, the adjusted R2 \n 23 \nwas weak in the sample.  This indicates that it was either a poorly-worded question, the \nrespondents misunderstood it, or that there was no association between their perceptions of \ntourism and their ability to be involved in the decision-making process.  This would be a \npotentially damning explanation and, if it were the case, would support the notion that the \nconsultation process must become more transparent and accessible before sustainable \ncommunity tourism can ever become a reality.  Interestingly, given the weak overall strength of \nthe equations, it was found that those with lower incomes were more likely to feel that they \ncould influence the decision-making process.  Perhaps this indicates the influence of older \npeople who have the time in retirement to involve themselves in local issues, or a degree of \nunemployment amongst younger age groups and a similar ability to become involved.  Either \nway, this was a concern of Keogh (1990), and remains an interesting area for research \ndevelopment since it may offer an insight into the motivations and ability of individuals to involve \nthemselves in local issues and the planning of their communities. \n \nCONCLUSION \nIt was suggested in the introduction to this article that the field of social impact studies \nwas somewhat fragmented and in need of a degree of consolidation.  Ap (1990) made several \nrecommendations as to how this could be done, including the utilization and reporting of more \nreliable measurement techniques.  To this end, this research adds the suggestion that previous \nresearch may have jumped too quickly from description, to modeling, and then explanation of \nsocial impacts; with, relatedly, not enough comparative work being produced.  The concern here \nis that tourism professionals might all too often be basing their planning decisions on \ngeneralizations and explanations grounded in underdeveloped areas of understanding.  This \npurpose of this paper has been to identify and examine the attitudes of residents in Bath \ntowards tourism development.  Based on this research it will be possible for longitudinal and \ncomparative research to be conducted in Bath and other historic cities that will help to provide \n 24 \nstronger understanding for planning decisions.  However, this research has also identified a \nparadox between the needs to disseminate research findings in a manner that promotes reliable \nand valid measurement techniques and the need for practitioners to be able to learn the lessons \nof social impact studies.  Understanding can better be promoted if a balance is truck between \nthese two competing pressures.   \n \nIn addition this research has identified a concern with the level of local involvement in \nthe tourism planning decision making process.  When developing the questionnaire and \nconducting the research for the study in Bath it became apparent that the research instruments \nunder consideration (Ap 1992; Madrigal 1995; Perdue et al 1990; Snaith and Haley 1994) \nconcentrated on issues which were predominantly general in nature.  By this is meant that they \nsought responses with regard to general concepts such as whether tourism had affected the \nrespondents' quality of life, whether there should be more or less local government control of \nthe industry, and whether it had affected the environment.  None was directly concerned with \nthe management and planning of tourism, especially at the community level.  Such questions as \n\"How are we doing?\" and \"What do you think of our policies and actions on your behalf?\" were \nnot asked of the residents. \n \nIf true evaluations of residents' attitudes towards tourism development, and the conduct \nof future planning and management are sought, then the requisite\/constituent questions should \nbe more specific and reflective of their destinations' experiences.  In response to this, the focus \nof the next social impact research phase should feature integrating the strategic objectives and \nactions of tourism officers with the attitudes of the local community toward these officially-stated \nobjectives and actions.  Thus, future research should aim to link the attitudes of the residents \nwith the strategies of policy makers in a way which can provide a basis for policies more \n 25 \nsecurely rooted in the needs of the residents.  Through such means, the capture of resident \nattitudes can be fully utilized in engaging the population in true and open consultation.  \u25a0 \n 26 \nREFERENCES \n \nAdams, J. \n 1963 Toward an Understanding of Inequity.
