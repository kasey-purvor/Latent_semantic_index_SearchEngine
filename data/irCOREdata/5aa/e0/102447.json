The basic principle is that an \nimage can be reconstructed by using the self similarities \nin the image itself. The satellite image is first partitioned \ninto a set of non-overlapping ranges. For each range, a \n\"best matching'' domain block would be found and a set \nof affine transformation would be performed. The \ncompression would be obtained by storing only the \ndescriptions of this transformation. \nThe fractal compression method is implemented on two \nimages, a complicated city image and a simple coastal \narea image. Using a fractal algorithm, the data integrity \nof the coastal area image was maintained with a Peak \nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of approximately 34.9dB \nwhile achieving a compression ratio of 172:l. A novel \napproach of using a combination of fractal and wavelet \nalgorithms for data compression will also be described. \nINTRODUCTION \nDigital images associated with satellite remote sensing \nposses the characteristics of being data intensive. Huge \namount of data would require much storage space and longer \ntransmission time of data. In order to solve these storage \nspace and time constraints, data compression has always been \nactively researched upon by the remote sensing community. \nThe term fractal was first used by Benoit Mandelbrot to \ndesignate objects that are self-similar at different scales. \nMandelbrot had observed that complex images could be \nobtained from simple formulas. Given a formula, it is \nrelatively easy to derive the corresponding image. Bansley, \nanother researcher, implemented this concept to image \ncompression. Instead of representing the image as a long \nsequence of pixel value, the image can be reconstructed from \na formula, which can be encoded in a much smaller number \nof bytes. This form of compression is termed as fractal \ncompression. [ 11 \nThe focus in this paper is the examination and \nimplementation of a simple fractal algorithm on satellite \nimages. In this method, the redundancy of the digtal image \nis assumed to be exploitable through self-transformability on \na block-wise basis, i.e. the image can be built of transformed \ncopies of parts of itself. The key behind fractal image \ncompression is self-similarity in images. [2] \nThis fractal algorithm is implemented on two images, one \nbeing a complicated image and the other being a simple \nimage with many similar segments. This implementation \ndemonstrates the effectiveness of the fractal compression \nmethod on satellite images with many similar segments. \nAlthough direct implementation of the fractal compression \n0-7803-6359-O\/OO\/$lO.OO 0 2000 IEEE \nalgorithm does not provide a universal solution to all satellite \nimages, it could prove useful if combined with wavelet \ntransformations. [ 3 ]  \nSATELLITE IMAGE COMPRESSION USING \nFRACTAL ALGORITHM \nFractal image compression is a compression scheme that \nencodes one part of an image by other parts of the image \nthrough some transformation techniques. The image in this \nfractal compression method is firstly partitioned into a \nnumber of blocks of size 2N x 2N pixels called domain \nblocks and a number of non-overlapping blocks of size N x N \npixels called range blocks. For each non-overlapping range, \nthe algorithm aims to find the domain block and \ntransformation that is the best match of the range. \nOne major setback of fractal compression is the \ncomplicated computations required, resulting to very slow \ncompression operations. To speed up the compression \nprocess, some cumulative tables are created for the range and \ndomain data. Another significant speed improvement is \nachieved by avoiding domain-range comparisons that have \nlittle probability of providing a good match. In the algorithm, \nthe range and domain blocks are-categorized to different \nclasses and comparisons are done to members of the same \nclass. The class is determined by the ordering of the image \nbrightness in the four quadrants of the range or domain. \nAfter the initial computation of the image is completed, a \ngood match for a non-overlapping range block and a domain \nblock is attempted. If there is no domain block could match \nthe range block based on a specified quality value, the range \nis further split into 4 ranges. This process is repeated \nrecursively until the minimum size of the range block or the \nspecified quality value is attained. \nTo access the similarity between a domain block and a \nrange block, the best possible mapping from a domain block \nand range block is to be found. Affine transformations are \nused for this purpose. \nAn affine map is defined as follows, \nwhere Wi is the mapping of a domain block to a range \nblock, x and y are the spatial components of a domain block, z \n609 \nis the luminance component of a domain block, a is the \nscaling factor, d is the translation factor, c is the contrast \nfactor, and b is the brightness factor. \nThe specified quality value or the best affine map from a \nrange block and a domain block is found by computing the \nsum of squared errors between a range block and a mapped \ndomain block. \nmost important information involving compression is the \ninformation on how many times the image is being \ncompressed. The compression measure I used for comparison \nis the Compression Ratio (CR). \nThe Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) is defined as \nfollows, \nPSNR = - 10 log[ (V-V original ) * \/ 255 2 ]  (5) \n2 \nE(c,b) = x ( c d i  + b - r i )  (2) \ni=l \nwhere E is the sum of squared errors, di is the pixel value \nin a domain, ri is the pixel value, n is the number of pixels in \na range block, c (contrast) could be obtained from, \nC =  \nand b (brightness) could be obtained from, \np r i  - c p d i  \nb = i=l i=l \nn \n(3) \n(4) \nIn the decompression module, the encoded affine maps are \nfirst read in. The decoder then starts with a random initial \nimage and undertakes a few iterations. For each iteration, all \nmaps are applied to the current image. \nTherefore, in the fractal compression method, the encoding \nof the total number of affine transformations requires far \nfewer bits than enumerating all the pixel values, resulting to \ndata compression. [2] \nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nIn this section, we present some experimental results of \nsatellite image compression by applying the fractal algorithm \non two satellite images, a city area and a coastal area. By \nvarying the quality value, different compression ratio with \ncorresponding fidelity value could be obtained. \nIn a digital image processing system, it is usually necessary \nto provide some form of performance comparison between an \noriginal image and a processed image. One approach is to \nspecify image fidelity in terms of the discrete samples of the \nimages. One common discrete image fidelity measures \nexpressed in decibel form is the Peak Signal To Noise Ratio \n(PSNR). Besides knowing the image fidelity measure, the \nwhere Voriginal is a pixel value of the original image, V is a \npixel value of the reconstructed image. \nFigure 1 presents some experimental results in a graphical \nmanner, comparing PSNR with CR for the two different \nsatellite images. \nFigure 2 shows reconstructed images with different \ncompression ratios and fidelity values. A compression ratio \nof 11:l with a PSNR of 25.03db could be obtained from a \nsatellite image of a city while a compression ratio of 173:l \nwith a PSNR of 34.9dB could be obtained from a satellite \nimage of a coastal area. \nI 8 10 4 6 Compressed Ratio l2 I \na) Satellite image of a City Area \nI 0 6oo I 200 400 Compressed Ratio \nb) Satellite image of a Coastal Area \nFigure 1.

Remote Sensing Image Compression \nUsing Fractal algorithm \nDISCUSSIONS \nThe experimental results show that the fractal compression \nmethod could achieve better results for images with more \nsimilarities such as the coastal area image. \nThe fractal compression algorithm could be improved by \nimplementing it with bi-orthorgonal wavelet filters. Applying \nwavelet filters to an image will transform the image from a \ntime domain into a frequency domain. In the initial iteration \nof the wavelet filter algorithm, the image is decomposed into \none coarse and three detail components. After N \ndecomposition iterations, there would be 3N detail \ncomponents and one coarse component of the original image. \nThe coarse component of the image could be understood as a \nlow-pass filtered sub-image and the detail components \nunderstood as high-pass filtered sub-images of the original \nimage. Figure 3 shows an image which undergone 3 iterations \nwith one coarse component and 9 detail components. It can \nbe observed that the various detail components have \nsimilarities. \nThe coarse component of the image is first coded using \nadaptive differential pulse modulation method (ADPCM) \nwhile the fractal algorithm is implemented on the detail \ncomponents. Higher compression ratio with lower PSNR \nresults would be attained with an image undergoing more \nwavelet filters iterations. [3] \nCONCLUSION \nIn this paper, a fractal compression algorithm was \ndescribed and successfully implemented on two satellite \nimages, a complicated and a simple image. Using the fractal \ncompression algorithm, it was found that the compression \nratio could reach up to 173:l while maintaining a PSNR of \n34.9dB for a coastal area image. As for the city area image, \ncompression ratio could reach up to 1 I : 1 while maintaining a \nPSNR of 25.03dB. An improvement to the fractal \ncompression method by combining fractals and wavelets has \nalso been described. \nREFERENCES \n[ 11 Michael F.Barnsley, \u201cFractals Everywhere\u201d, Academic \nPress INC, 1988. \n[2] Mark Nelson, \u201cThe Data Compression Book\u201d, M&T \nBooks, 1996. \n[3] T Yu, A.T.S Ho, \u201c A Novel Hybrid Bi-orthogonal \nWavelet\/ADPCM Algorithm for very Low Bit Rate Satellite \nImage Compression \u201d, IEEEAGARSS, 1999. \n[4] Heinz-Otto Peitgen, Dietmar saupe , \u201cChaos & Fractals : \nNew Frontiers of Science, Springer Verlag , 1992. \n[5] Yuval Fisher, \u201cFractal Image Compression\u201d, Springer- \nVerlag, 1995. \n[6] A.T.S Ho, T Yu, \u201cImproving Vector Quantization of \nSatellite Images Through the Application of Bi-orthogonal \nWavelets \u201d, IEEELGARSS, 1999. \n[7] Burrus CS,  \u201cIntroduction to wavelets and wavelet \ntransform: a primer\u201d, Prentice Hall, 1998. \nFigure 3.
