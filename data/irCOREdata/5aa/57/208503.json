This paper argues that the \nBank\u2019s conclusions depend on a method for computing user costs from resource \nexploitation that is challenged by two competing ones (the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method \nand the method of Repetto et al.) and is inferior to one of its rivals. Resource \nrents are re-computed using the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method for 14 countries and the \nSub-Saharan and Northern African and Middle East regions. The results are \nthat both regions and almost all countries either stop exhibiting signs of unsus-\ntainability or their unsustainability can be explained without having recourse to \nresource accounting. However, for Congo, Ecuador, Gabon, Nigeria, Maurita-\nnia and Trinidad and Tobago there is a lesson: These countries did not ade-\nquately use the opportunities they were given through their natural resource \nendowments and should learn from their mistake for the future depletion of \ntheir remaining reserves of natural resources. \n 1 \n1. Introduction \n \nIf sustainability is defined as the capacity to provide non-declining future wel-\nfare then, clearly, a reliable measure of sustainability would be of great policy \nusefulness. In recent years, several studies have been undertaken claiming to \nprovide an admittedly crude measure of weak sustainability for single countries \nor a selection of countries \u2014 e.g. Repetto et al. (1989) for Indonesia, Repetto and \nCruz (1991) for Costa Rica, van Tongeren et al. (1993) for Mexico, Bartelmus et \nal. (1993) for Papua New Guinea, Ser\u00f4a da Motta and Young (1995) for Brazil, \nand Pearce and Atkinson (1993), and Hamilton and Atkinson (1996) for several \ncountries. The term \u2018weak\u2019 refers to the fact that, often implicitly, perfect substi-\ntutability between man-made, natural and other forms of capital is assumed in \nboth production and utility functions. \nWorld Bank (1997a) is the most comprehensive of these studies, covering 103 \ncountries in total over a period of 25 years. It suggests that the world taken to-\ngether as well as the high-income countries are safely weak sustainable due to \nhigh investments in man-made and human capital. It also suggests that most \nSub-Saharan countries and the whole region show signs of unsustainability dur-\ning the 1980s and 1990s. The same is true for some North African and Middle \nEast countries and the region as a whole who fail to pass the test of weak sus-\ntainability from the early 1970s onwards. \nThis paper critically examines the World Bank (1997a) study. It shows that \nthe Bank\u2019s rather strong conclusions crucially depend on a method for comput-\ning resource rents that is one of at least three competing ones and is inferior to \n 2 \none of its rivals. Using the so-called \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method to compute resource \nrents leads to opposite conclusions for both regions and indeed for most coun-\ntries that fail to pass the test of weak sustainability according to World Bank \n(1997a). Thus it is demonstrated that the study does not provide a reliable sus-\ntainability indicator and will lead to wrong policy conclusions. \nThe paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the structure of the \ndata and the main conclusions of World Bank (1997a). It also states the welfare \ntheoretic foundations for the Bank\u2019s \u2018genuine savings\u2019 indicator of unsustain-\nability. Section 3 discusses competing methods for computing resource rents \nand argues why using the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method is preferable to the Bank\u2019s \nmethod. Section 4 undertakes empirical sensitivity analysis in computing re-\nsource rents according to the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method in the calculation of genuine \nsavings for those countries that appeared to be unsustainable according to \nWorld Bank (1997a). It shows that the Bank\u2019s conclusions are largely reversed if \nthis competing method is used. Nevertheless, a few countries keep on exhibit-\ning signs of unsustainability. For these countries in particular section 5 dis-\ncusses policy implications. Section 6 concludes. \n \n \n2. The World Bank study \n \nThe data set underlying World Bank (1997a) consists of savings and accompa-\nnying data (World Bank 1997b). Of special interest here is what the Bank calls \n\u201eExtended Genuine Saving II\u201c (EGS II): gross saving as conventionally defined \n 3 \nin the system of national accounts plus education expenditures minus deprecia-\ntion of man-made capital minus resource rents from the depletion of natural \nresources minus damage caused by CO2-emissions as a proxy for other pollut-\nants.1 Current educational spending (e.g. teachers\u2019 salaries, expenditures on \ntextbooks) is considered as an investment in human capital, rather than con-\nsumption as in the traditional national accounts. The difference is relevant, \nsince current expenditures make up more than 90% of all educational expendi-\ntures (World Bank 1997a, p. 34). For the computation of natural resource rents \nWord Bank (1997a) includes the following items: oil, natural gas, hard coal, \nbrown coal, bauxite, copper, iron, lead, nickel, zinc, phosphate, tin, gold, silver \nand forests. Rents are usually computed as price minus average costs times \nproduction\/harvest, i.e. they are valued at so-called total Hotelling-rent where \nthe more readily available average costs are used as a proxy for the theoretically \ncorrect marginal costs. The only pollutant considered are CO2-emissions which \nare valued at 20 US$ per metric tonne of carbon. The value is taken from Fank-\nhauser (1995) and is often regarded as a consensus estimate.2 \nOf all the data underlying World Bank (1997a) EGS II is closest to a broad \nmeasure of weak sustainability. This result can be derived from dynamic opti-\nmisation models as, e.g., in Hamilton (1994, 1996) and Neumayer (1999). While \nAsheim (1994) and Pezzey and Withagen (1995) have shown that positive genu-\nine saving rates are only a necessary, but not sufficient condition for weak sus-\ntainability, \u201epersistently negative rates of genuine saving must lead, eventually, \nto declining well-being\u201c (World Bank 1997a, p. 28). \n 4 \nNote that because of the underlying optimisation framework efficient re-\nsource pricing according to the Hotelling (1931) rule is implicitly assumed: re-\nsource rent rises over time at the rate of interest. This leads to some modifica-\ntions for the \u2018keep genuine savings above zero\u2019 rule for an open economy \n(Hartwick 1996, Asheim 1996). With marginal extraction costs not falling at a \nrate higher than the interest rate, future resource prices will be higher than cur-\nrent ones, thus providing the resource exporter with improving terms-of-trade. \nDue to that, the exporter of natural non-renewable resources can have negative \ngenuine savings and still ensure sustainability. The resource importer, on the \nother hand, faces a future deterioration in her terms-of-trade, so she must save \nmore than would be the case in a closed economy. That is, it is on the non-\nrenewable resource importer to make an extra-adjustment for the growing scar-\ncity of the resource. \nIn World Bank (1997a) no correction term for anticipated price changes is in-\ncluded on either the resource exporter\u2019s or importer\u2019s side, however. The rea-\nson is presumably that the authors consider empirical support for efficient re-\nsource pricing to be rather weak and are unsure about the future development \nof actual net resource prices, so that \u201eas a default \u2018rule of thumb\u2019 for sustainabil-\nity, simply investing current resource rents is likely to be the prudent course of \naction\u201c (Hamilton and Atkinson 1996, p. 4) for both importers and exporters.3 \nThis disregarding of future price changes is problematic because it contradicts \nthe underlying dynamic optimisation assumptions which were necessary to \nprovide the sustainability foundations of genuine savings in the first place. \n 5 \nWorld Bank (1997a) assigns all damage from CO2 to the emitting country. \nThis allocation rule is not compelling. Damage from global warming is caused \nby the accumulated stock of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Developing coun-\ntries could make a point in claiming that their incremental CO2-emissions \nshould count less than those from developed countries considering the already \nexisting stock of CO2 in the atmosphere mainly due to developed country emis-\nsions. A closer inspection of the data in World Bank (1997b) reveals, however, \nthat damage from CO2-emissions plays a negligible role in bringing EGS II \nrates4 down below zero. I therefore do not undertake sensitivity analyses for \ndamage from CO2-emissions. \nThe years covered in World Bank (1997a) are 1970 to 1994, for some coun-\ntries only up to 1993. The data set includes 103 countries, which are grouped \ninto income and regional groups (see World Bank 1997b). None of the former or \ncurrent communist countries is included, for lack of data with acceptable qual-\nity. Some of the very small countries are missing as well. Appendix 1 indicates \nwhich countries had certain ranges of years with negative EGS II rates. \nFigure 1 shows EGS II rates for four different income groups and the world \ntaken together.5 Keeping in mind that \u201ewhere genuine saving is negative, it is a \nclear indicator of unsustainability\u201c (World Bank 1995, p. 53), it is apparent that \nfor the world taken together and the high income countries in particular there is \nno indication of unsustainability. All of the other three income groups experi-\nence a few years with negative rates, most notably the group of lower middle \nincome countries. The rates are only slightly negative, however, and they are \nnot persistent in the sense that they become positive again in the early and mid-\n 6 \n1980s and reach their former level in the early 1990s. It can be concluded there-\nfore that at this level of aggregation no clear signs of unsustainability are ap-\nparent. \n \n \nFigure 2 shows EGS II rates for a selection of five different regions. The \nhighest rates are achieved in East Asia where they usually fluctuate between \n10% and 20%. South Asia\u2019s EGS II rates are relatively constant around 6-7 % \nand never go negative. For the Caribbean and Latin America the rates decline \nfrom 10% in the late 1970s to just below 0% in 1985 from where they have risen \nagain to just over 5% in 1993. More problematic is the region of Sub-Saharan \nAfrica. Its EGS II-rate declined from around 5% in the late 1970s to become \nnegative in 1979, slightly positive in 1980 and turned negative again afterwards \nwhere it has stayed for the rest of the period, fluctuating around -5%. Still more \nproblematic is the region of North Africa and Middle East. This region experi-\nenced positive rates only in 1972, 1973 and 1987. During the late 1970s and early \n1980s it exhibited rates drastically lower than -10%, reaching its climax in 1979 \nwith almost -30%! If persistent EGS II rates are a clear indicator of unsustain-\nability, then Africa and the Middle East appear to be on an unsustainable path. \n \nSource: Own computations from World Bank (1997b). \nFigure 1. Extended Genuine Saving II rates for income groups. \n 7 \n \nTo analyse what drives EGS II rates to become negative it is best to disag-\ngregate the data still further and look at individual country experiences. I de-\ncided, somewhat arbitrarily, to translate \u201epersistently negative rates\u201c into \u201ehav-\ning experienced negative rates for more than 10 years in the period 1970-1994\u201c \nthough not necessarily in a row. 24 out of the total of 103 countries were unsus-\ntainable thus defined. \nFor 5 out of these 24 countries \u2014 Chad, Madagascar, Malawi, Sierra Leone \nand Uganda \u2014 the EGS II rates are very close to and move very closely with the \nExtended Net Saving (ENetS) rates, where ENetS is defined as gross saving \nfrom the traditional system of national accounts minus depreciation of man-\nmade capital plus education expenditures. For these countries, therefore, unsus-\ntainability can already be explained without having recourse to taking natural \ncapital into account: they are on an unsustainable path because they eat up their \nstock of man-made capital. Even taking ENetS as an indicator would detect \nthese countries as unsustainable and looking at EGS II instead would not give \nmajor new insights. These countries are therefore excluded from the further \nanalysis. \n \n \n3. Competing methods for computing resource rents \n \nSource: Own computations from World Bank (1997b). \nFigure 2. Extended Genuine Saving II rates for regions. \n 8 \nOf particular interest is what drives the EGS II rates below ENetS rates for the \nother countries. Since ENetS minus rents from natural resource depletion minus \n(negligible) damage from CO2-emissions equals EGS II, we have to examine in \nmore detail how the numbers for resource rents are generated. \nThe Bank values resource rents to be deducted from ENetS as \n \n(1)  ( )P AC R\u2212 \u22c5  \n \nwhere P is the resource price, AC is average cost and R is resource depletion. \nNote that (1) roughly corresponds to total Hotelling rent, except that the more \nreadily available average costs are used instead of marginal costs. \nResource discoveries do not enter the formula. The Bank values discoveries \nat average discovery costs which are used as a more readily available proxy for \nmarginal costs. Since \u201eexploration expenditures are treated as investment in \nstandard national accounting\u201c (World Bank 1997a, p. 28) already anyway, there \nis no correction term for discoveries. \nThe Bank\u2019s method to compute resource rents is just one of at least three. \nThe others I look at here are the so-called \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method (El Serafy 1989, \n1991) and the method of Repetto et al. (Repetto et al. 1989, Repetto and Cruz \n1991). The formula for the method of Repetto et al. is: \n \n  ( ) ( )P AC R D\u2212 \u22c5 \u2212  \n \n 9 \nwhere D is resource discoveries. Note that in this method resource discoveries \nare valued at P-AC, i.e. at net profits and that the correction term can be posi-\ntive if D > R in the accounting period. Efficient resource pricing according to \nHotelling\u2019s rule is implicitly assumed. Also note that, strictly speaking, explora-\ntion expenditures should be netted out from NNP, if this method is used, in \norder to avoid partial double counting of resource discoveries. \nThe formula for the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method is: \n \n (2) ( )\n( )\nP AC R\nr n\n\u2212 \u22c5 \u22c5\n+\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa+\n1\n1 1\n \n \nwhere r is the discount rate and n is the number of remaining years of the re-\nsource stock if production was the same in the future as in the base year, i.e. n is \nthe static reserves to production ratio. If r > 0 and n > 0, then (2) will produce a \nsmaller deduction term for resource depletion than (1). \n(2) is also called the \u2018user cost\u2019 of resource depletion since it indicates the \nshare of resource receipts that should be considered as capital depreciation. \nNote that no explicit correction term for resource discoveries is needed in this \nmethod since discoveries enter the formula via changing n and the formula is \ncomputed anew for each year. \nThe formula for the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method is derived from the following reason-\ning: receipts from non-renewable resource extraction should not fully count as \n\u2018sustainable income\u2019 because resource extraction leads to a lowering of the re-\nsource stock and thus brings with it an element of depreciation of the resource \n 10 \ncapital stock.6 While the receipts from the resource stock will end at some finite \ntime, \u2018sustainable income\u2019 by definition must last forever. Hence, \u2018sustainable \nincome\u2019 is that part of resource receipts which if received infinitely would have \na present value just equal to the present value of the finite stream of resource \nreceipts over the life-time of the resource. \nDefining resource receipts RC as RC P AC R\u2261 \u2212 \u22c5( ) , then the present value of \nresource receipts RC at the constant discount rate r over the expected life-time n \nof the resource stock is equal to: \n \n(3)  \nRC\nr\nRC\nr\nr\ni\ni\nn n\n( )\n( )\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n+\n\u2211 =\n\u2212\n+\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa\n\u2212\n+\n=\n+\n \n \nThe present value of an infinite stream of \u2018sustainable income\u2019 SI is \n \n(4)  \nSI\nr\nSI r\nr\nSI\nr\ni\ni ( )\n( )\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0 +\n\u2211 =\n+\n=\n\u2212\n+\n=\n\u221e\n \n \nSetting (3) and (4) equal and rearranging expresses SI as a fraction of RC:7 \n \n(5)  SI RC\nr n\n= \u2212\n+\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa+1\n1\n1 1( )\n \n \n 11 \nThe correction term, representing user cost or the depreciation of the re-\nsource stock, would thus be \n \n  ( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\nRC SI RC\nr\nP AC R\nrn n\n\u2212 =\n+\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa = \u2212 \u22c5\n+\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa+ +\n1\n1\n1\n11 1\n \n \nwhich is the formula in (2). An estimate of the life-time of the resource, n, that is \nthe static reserves to production ratio is required. The \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method does \nnot presume efficient resource pricing \u2014 resource rent growing at the rate of \ninterest according to Hotelling\u2019s rule \u2014, because it is not dependent on an op-\ntimisation model. It is an \u201eex post approach, capable of accounting for any en-\ntrepreneurial decisions regarding extraction\u201c (El Serafy 1997, p. 222). As a con-\nsequence future resource receipts have to be discounted and the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-\nmethod requires the selection of a discount rate r. If either the life-time of the \nresource asset, n, or the discount rate r are quite large, the necessary correction \nterm will consequently be rather small (see equation (2)). Also note that the cor-\nrection term can never be positive. \nWhich method for computing natural resource rents should be preferred? \nBoth the World Bank\u2019s method and the method of Repetto et al. can be derived \nfrom a dynamic optimisation model. The difference is that to arrive at the \nWorld Bank\u2019s method expenditures for resource exploration are modelled as \ndepending on the stock of cumulated discoveries, whereas the method of Re-\npetto et al. can be derived from a model where these expenditures are a func-\ntion of the total stock of resources. Hamilton (1995, p. 64) shows that modelling \n 12 \ndiscovery expenditures being dependent on the resource stock leads to higher \ngenuine savings than if expenditures depend on the stock of cumulated discov-\neries. \nIn comparison, the method of Repetto et al. seems to lack direct intuitive ap-\npeal. Whereas there does not seem to exist a good reason for assuming that ex-\nploration costs depend on the total stock of a resource, it makes much sense to \nassume that resource exploration costs depend on the stock of past discoveries \nas the World Bank\u2019s method does. This is because later discoveries should be \nmore expensive than earlier ones if the easy to find reserves are discovered first \n\u2014 which we would expect in a dynamic optimisation framework. On the other \nhand, the two methods are obviously linked since resource discoveries both \nincrease the stock of past discoveries and the resource stock. Overall I would \nsay that on theoretical grounds there are more good reasons in favour of the \nWorld Bank\u2019s method. \nThe \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method, on the other hand, can be argued to be superior to \nthe Bank\u2019s method. This is for two reasons: one is that it is not derived from a \ndynamic optimisation model. None of the data the Bank uses are guaranteed to \nbe the ones that would be generated if a country\u2019s economy developed along \nthe optimal path and the Bank does not attempt to estimate any shadow values. \nActually, since, as mentioned already, the Bank excludes future terms-of-trade \neffects in computing EGS II, it even implicitly excludes efficient resource pric-\ning. Hence, to be consistent, it is better to use a method for computing resource \nrents that does not presume that the underlying data are optimal values either. \nInterestingly, in Atkinson et al. (1997, p. 60f.) the same authors on whose work \n 13 \nthe World Bank (1997a) study is mainly built upon, admit that since \u201ethere is \nlittle evidence for efficient pricing of resources in the ground\u201c, it \u201emay be ad-\nvisable to value resource depletion as a user cost with a non-zero discount rate\u201c \naccording to the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method. \nThe other reason for preferring the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method is that the Bank\u2019s \nmethod lacks intuitive appeal if one looks at the EGS II rates it generates for \ncertain countries. Take Saudi Arabia as an example: Figure 3 shows the coun-\ntry\u2019s ENetS rates together with EGS II rates calculated with the Word Bank \nmethod (EGS II (World Bank)) and EGS II rates calculated with the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-\nmethod (EGS II (El Serafy)). EGS II measures increases or decreases in the total \nstock of a nation\u2019s capital. According to EGS II (World Bank) Saudi Arabia has \nhad persistent negative rates (usually lower than -20%) for the whole period of \naccounting. This does not make any sense since it would mean that after a few \nyears almost all of Saudi-Arabia\u2019s once existing total capital stock would have \nbeen eaten up and the country\u2019s economy would be doomed to collapse. Why \ndid it not collapse? Mainly because part of the resource rent should properly \ncount as income and not as capital depreciation and also because during the \naccounting period more oil and natural gas wells were discovered that boosted \nthe nation's capital stock. As we will see in the next section, if the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-\nmethod is used instead for computing net depreciation of the natural resource \nstock then Saudi-Arabia turns out to exhibit positive EGS II rates: the country\u2019s \ncapital stock has increased instead of diminished to negligible quantities as \nsuggested by the World Bank\u2019s method. This makes much more intuitive sense \nconsidering how well off Saudi Arabians are. \n 14 \n \n \nI do not claim that the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method is without problems. One of its \nshortcomings lies in its assumption about constant resource receipts, which has \nbeen one of the most frequently raised criticisms against the method (e.g. Hart-\nwick and Hageman (1993, p. 222), Aaheim and Nyborg (1995, p. 63), Brekke \n(1997, p. 524)). Note, however, that since World Bank (1997a) assumes constant \nnet resource prices as well, part of this criticism is irrelevant for the choice be-\ntween the World Bank\u2019s method and the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method. Also, it should be \nkept in mind that any practical method for resource accounting would need to \nassume constant resource receipts. Furthermore, the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method can use \nreadily available average costs without apology. The World Bank\u2019s method, on \nthe other hand, has to commit the mistake of inconsistency: for practical reasons \nit has to rely on average costs, but this contradicts once more the underlying \nassumption of efficient resource pricing according to the Hotelling rule which is \ndefined in marginal cost terms.8 \n \n \n4. Computing resource rents according to the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method \n \nIn the following sensitivity analysis resource rents have been computed with \nthe \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method instead of the Bank\u2019s method for the countries that have \nSource: Own computations from World Bank (1997b) and sources indicated in appendix 2. \nFigure 3. Sensitivity analysis for resource rents of Saudi Arabia. \n 15 \nbeen classified as unsustainable. Which resources do we need to look at for this \nanalysis? Table I provides the answer. It shows that for Algeria, Bolivia, Congo, \nEcuador, Gabon, Iran, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Vene-\nzuela the dominating force is oil and natural gas. Their share is always more \nthan 90% with the exception of Bolivia for which tin is also important. For \nPapua New Guinea the dominating resources are copper and gold, for Zambia \nit is copper, for Jamaica it is bauxite, for Mauritania iron ore. For Nepal, Haiti, \nand Ghana forestry represents a major share of resource rents. For Ghana it is \nalso gold. For the more important countries it is clearly rents from oil and natu-\nral gas that dominate. \n \n \nThe following sensitivity analysis covers oil, natural gas, bauxite, copper, \ngold, iron ore and tin. Appendix 2 describes the sources of data for computing \nuser costs according to the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method. Forestry was excluded due to the \nmany difficulties in getting reliable data. It follows that no sensitivity analysis \ncould be undertaken for Nepal and Haiti and for parts of Ghana\u2019s resource \nrents. A relatively low discount rate of 4% p.a. was applied following the rate \nwhich World Bank (1997a) uses for wealth estimations. \nThe sensitivity analysis reveals a number of things: \n \nSource: Own computations from World Bank (1997b). \nTable I. Share of single natural resources of total resource rents. \n 16 \n1) Those countries with huge reserves of resources relative to their production \nand positive ENetS rates throughout stop having negative EGS II rates (El \nSerafy) altogether or have only one year with a negative rate. This applies to \nAlgeria, Iran, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. (As an ex-\nample refer back to figure 3 for Saudi Arabia.) This was to be expected since \nhigh reserves to production ratios (a high n in equation (2)) depress the user \ncosts of resource depletion. This is because, for a given resource production, \na smaller share of the total resource stock is used up. \n \n2) The unsustainability of some countries with temporary negative ENetS rates \ncan be explained without taking recourse to EGS II rates. This applies to Bo-\nlivia and Jamaica, which for every year of negative EGS II rates (El Serafy) \nhave negative ENetS rates as well. It also applies to Ghana which has only \none year (1987) of both a positive ENetS-rate and a marginally negative \nEGS II-rate (El Serafy). For Zambia EGS II rates (El Serafy) are rather close to \nand move rather close with ENetS rates as well. Zambia has six years of \nslightly positive ENetS rates and slightly negative EGS II rates (El Serafy), \nhowever. \n \n3) Remain the cases of Congo, Ecuador, Gabon, Nigeria, Mauritania, and Trini-\ndad and Tobago. These countries share a similar experience: although EGS II \nrates (El Serafy) are considerably higher than EGS II rates (World Bank), in a \nnumber of years EGS II rates (El Serafy) are negative while ENetS rates are \nstill positive. For Congo this is true for four years, for Ecuador for seven \n 17 \nyears, for Gabon for four years, for Nigeria for six years, for Mauritania for \nthree years and for Trinidad and Tobago for seven years. The reasons for \nthis divergence are similar for these countries: they all have relatively low oil \nreserves to production ratios, with the exception of Mauritania which pro-\nduces iron ore.9 In addition, usually in the 1980s their production increased, \nwhile their reserves either remained constant or even declined which further \ndepressed their reserves to production ratio. Because of that the user costs \nfrom oil depletion calculated via the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method are high (although \nnot as high as according to the Bank\u2019s method, of course). Interestingly, all \nthese countries with the exception of Gabon exhibit high reserves to produc-\ntion ratios for natural gas over the period 1970-1994, i.e. their natural gas re-\nserves have not been significantly exploited so far.10 This can provide some \nhints as to how past mistakes can be avoided in the future as will be argued \nin the next section. Before doing so let us ask first, however, whether we can \nconclude that for these six countries the failure of passing the test of weak \nsustainability can be reliably detected only with EGS II rates (El Serafy), \nwhereas their ENetS rates would misleadingly suggest that these countries \nare weakly sustainable. \nThe answer is no, at least not in general. This is because in computing \nEGS II rates (El Serafy) a rather low rate of discount (4% p.a.) was deliber-\nately chosen so as to provide a conservative estimate of the divergence from \nthe EGS II rates (World Bank). Usually, real rates of return, especially in de-\nveloping countries are much higher than 4% p.a. For further analysis I have \ntherefore analysed the effects of choosing a discount rate of 10% p.a. Look-\n 18 \ning back at equation (2) reveals that a high discount rate (r) depresses user \ncosts. This is because a smaller share of resource receipts has to be invested \nin an alternative asset in order to provide a sustainable alternative income \nstream if the rate of return on this investment is higher. \nFor Congo and Nigeria the EGS II rates (El Serafy) move so close with the \nENetS rates if a discount rate of 10% p.a. is used that hardly any additional \ninformation is revealed by looking at EGS II (El Serafy 10% p.a.) rather than \nENetS. Gabon stops exhibiting any signs of unsustainability if EGS II (El Ser-\nafy) is calculated with the higher discount rate. The same is true for Mauri-\ntania except for one year in which her ENetS-rate is also negative. For the \ntwo remaining countries the picture is less clear-cut. Ecuador has only two \nyears with negative ENetS rates, but still six years of negative EGS II rates \n(El Serafy 10% p.a.) \u2014 see figure 4 below. The gap between EGS II rates (El \nSerafy 10% p.a.) and EGS II rates (World Bank) is quite large (up to about 20 \npercentage points in 1984), but it is not always enough to bridge the gap be-\ntween ENetS rates and EGS II rates (El Serafy 10% p.a.). The same is basi-\ncally true for Trinidad and Tobago which has four negative EGS II rates (El \nSerafy 10% p.a.), but only two negative ENetS rates. Especially for these two \ncountries a lesson can be learned from their gap between ENetS and EGS II \n(El Serafy), whether calculated at 4% p.a. or 10% p.a., and it is this the next \nsection focuses on. \n \nSource: Own computations from World Bank (1997b) and sources indicated in appendix 2. \nFigure 4. Further sensitivity analysis for Ecuador. \n 19 \n \n \n5. Policy implications \n \nThe divergence between ENetS rates and the EGS II rates (El Serafy), that is de-\ntectable even with a discount rate of 10% p.a., can provide some hints for better \nfuture resource management. What the divergence suggests is that these coun-\ntries in the past did not adequately use the opportunities they were given \nthrough their oil endowment, or in the case of Mauritania iron ore endowment, \nto build up and maintain man-made and human capital in exchange for re-\nsource depletion. They should learn from their mistake for the future depletion \nof their as yet hardly exploited natural gas reserves or, in the case of Maurita-\nnia, the still considerable iron ore reserves. 11 \nThis is one of the rare points where this paper\u2019s analysis is in harmony with \nthe basic reasoning in the World Bank\u2019s conclusions: \u201eThe depressed rates of \ngenuine saving (...) represent an opportunity not seized. (...) [I]t is often the \ngross saving effort that is insufficient in these countries, which points the finger \nsquarely at broader macroeconomic policies.\u201c (World Bank 1997a, p. 35). The \nfundamental message of this conclusion is not confined to Congo, Ecuador, Ga-\nbon, Nigeria, Mauritania, and Trinidad and Tobago, however. Even for coun-\ntries with very high reserves to production ratios and hence no indication of a \nfailure to pass the test of weak sustainability, a large divergence between ENetS \nrates and EGS II rates (El Serafy) suggests \u201ethat due prudence is not being fol-\n 20 \nlowed \u2014 that some amount of the national [natural resource, E.N.] wealth is \nsimply consumed...\u201c (World Bank 1997a, p. 35). \nFinally, let us have a look at some aggregate graphs. Figure 5 compares \nEGS II rates (World Bank) for Sub-Saharan Africa and for North Africa and \nMiddle East to their EGS II rates (El Serafy) with a discount rate of 4% p.a. \nWhereas Sub-Saharan Africa has 14 years of negative EGS II rates following the \nWorld Bank method, there are only four years with slightly negative rates if \nresource rents are computed with the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method. The latter paints a \npicture of much less gloom for the region.12 \n \n \nThe reversal in conclusion about the sustainability performance of a region \nis even drastically stronger in the case of North Africa and Middle East. \nWhereas EGS II rates (World Bank) suggest that this region is clearly unsustain-\nable with only three years of positive rates, the graph of EGS II rates (El Serafy) \npaints a completely different picture: North Africa and Middle East never fail to \npass the test of weak sustainability and, better still, exhibit quite strong EGS II \nrates (El Serafy) that are above 20% in eight years and between 10% and 20% for \nthe rest of the period with the exception of one year! The policy conclusions \nfrom the two methods are completely different: whereas the World Bank \nmethod suggests that North African and Middle East countries endanger the \nSource: Own computations from World Bank (1997b) and sources indicated in appendix 2. \nFigure 5. Sensitivity analysis for Sub-Saharan Africa, and North Africa and Middle \nEast \n 21 \nwelfare of their future populations, the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method suggests that there is \nno reason to worry about sustainability since enough of the resource rents are \ninvested in man-made and human capital to ensure non-declining future wel-\nfare. \n \n \n6. Conclusion \n \nThe World Bank (1997a) study claims that many Sub-Saharan and North Afri-\ncan and Middle East as well as some countries from other regions have failed to \npass the test of weak sustainability. This paper has shown in a sensitivity analy-\nsis that this conclusion crucially depends on the specific method the World \nBank uses to compute resource rents. In calculating resource rents with this \nmethod the Bank applies an inconsistent methodology: on the one hand, its \nmethod for resource accounting assumes efficient resource pricing as a neces-\nsary consequence of the underlying dynamic optimisation framework that pro-\nvides the welfare theoretic foundations for genuine savings. On the other hand, \nWorld Bank (1997a) implicitly rejects efficient resource pricing in ignoring fu-\nture terms-of-trade effects according to the Hotelling (1931) rule. Using Saudi \nArabia as an example, it was shown that this inconsistency leads to the counter-\nfactual conclusion that the country has depleted its capital to an extent that its \ninhabitants should be severely impoverished which they are clearly not. \nAs an alternative the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method was therefore employed which was \nargued to be superior to the World Bank\u2019s method since it does not depend on \n 22 \nefficient resource pricing and leads to intuitively more plausible conclusions. If \nthis alternative method is used with a relatively low discount rate of 4% p.a., \nSub-Saharan Africa does not exhibit persistent negative rates of genuine saving \nanymore and the region of North Africa and Middle East turns out to be a \nstrong genuine saver. This finding holds basically true on a disaggregated level \nas well for most countries that were detected by World Bank (1997a) as unsus-\ntainable: either they do not fail to pass the test of weak sustainability anymore \nor their unsustainability can be explained with negative extended net saving \nrates alone, i.e. without taking recourse to resource depletion. \nAs mentioned already, I do not claim that the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method is perfect. \nIn addition to the points discussed already comes the fact that the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-\nmethod can produce different figures using different discount rates and it is far \nfrom clear what the \u2018right\u2019 rate is. Another problem is that very often reserve \ndata of resources are much less reliable than production data and sometimes \ncompletely missing. Given the crucial role that n, the static reserves to produc-\ntion ratio, plays in calculating user cost, this certainly represents a weakness \nand a lot more effort would be needed to establish reliable and verifiable re-\nserve data. Maybe therefore future research can find a better method for com-\nputing net depreciation of the natural resource stock. What matters for the \nanalysis in this paper is that I have argued that the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method is better \nthan the World Bank\u2019s method. Furthermore, even those who would disagree \nwith this suggestion, would have to admit that a measure of unsustainability \ncannot be reliable if its main conclusions are reverted by using a competing and \nnot obviously inferior method for resource accounting. \n 23 \nIf the World Bank\u2019s (1997a) results are taken serious as a reliable indicator of \nunsustainability, the Bank itself and other institutions will be tempted to follow \nwrong policy conclusions for the wrong countries. One policy conclusion At-\nkinson and Hamilton (1996, p. 4f. and 14) and Atkinson et al. (1997, p. 114) ten-\ntatively suggest, is making aid concessional for developing countries who fail to \npass the test of weak sustainability in order to bring them (back) on a sustain-\nable path.13 As this paper has made clear, it is much more difficult to detect \nthese countries and the reason for their failure to be sustainable is likely to stem \nfrom inadequate extended net savings rather than from wasting the receipts \nfrom resource depletion. \nMany other critical aspects of the World Bank (1997a) study have not been \nscrutinised in this paper. For example, it is debatable whether valuing CO2-\nemissions with 20US$ per tonne of carbon is sufficient to account for damage \ncaused by greenhouse gases and, particularly, by other pollutants. In doing so, \nmore might have been left out than has been included. Also, the coverage of \nrenewable resources would need to be extented in order to arrive at a compre-\nhensive genuine saving measure. Forests are an important renewable resource, \nbut not the only one. If possible, resources like water, soil, fish and, more gen-\nerally, biodiversity should be included. On the other hand, World Bank (1997a) \ndoes not take into account the beneficial effects of future technical progress on \nthe capacity of a nation to provide non-declining future welfare. More funda-\nmentally, it is highly contested whether reliable measurements of unsustainabil-\nity are possible at all with a genuine savings concept that depends on a dynamic \noptimisation framework when a country\u2019s economy is likely to develop along a \n 24 \nnon-optimal path; on this see Aaheim and Nyborg (1995) and Neumayer (1999). \nWhat this paper has shown, in any case, is that even if these further complica-\ntions are neglected, the World Bank (1997a) study does not provide a reliable \nmeasure of unsustainability and is therefore likely to lead to wrong policy con-\nclusions. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nI thank James Putzel, Michael Jacobs, Lord Meghnad Desai and two anonymous \nreferees for helpful comments.

If not stated otherwise in the text, the discount rate was assumed to be 4% p.a. This is the \nrate World Bank (1997a) uses for wealth estimations (for a justification see Kunte et al. 1997, p. \n8f.). \n \nOil \nProduction figures covering the period 1970-1994 came from British Petroleum (1980, 1986, \n1997) with the exception of Bolivia and Congo. For Congo production data for 1970-1979 came \nfrom Petroleum Publishing (various years) and from British Petroleum (1986, 1997) for 1980-\n1994. For Bolivia production for 1970-1994 was taken from Financial Times Oil and Gas (various \nyears). \nWith the exception of Bolivia, Congo, and Trinidad and Tobago proven reserves were taken \nfrom OPEC (1979) for the years 1970-1979 and from OPEC (1997) for the years 1980-1994. For \nBolivia, Congo, and Trinidad and Tobago reserves were taken from Energy Information Ad-\nministration (1991) for the years 1970-1991 and from Petroleum Publishing (various years) for \n1992-1994. \n \n 28 \nNatural Gas \nProduction data covering the period 1970-1994 came from OPEC (various years) with the excep-\ntion of Congo, Ecuador and Gabon. For Ecuador production data for 1991-1994, for Gabon pro-\nduction data for 1971-1973 and for Congo production data for the period 1970-1994 came from \nUnited Nations Yearbook (various years). For 1970-1990 production data for Ecuador and for \n1974-1994 production data for Gabon came from OPEC (various years). \nWith the exception of Bolivia and Congo proven reserves were taken from OPEC (1980) for \n1971-1979 and from OPEC (1997) for the years 1980-1994. For Bolivia and Congo proven re-\nserves for the period 1970-1994 were taken from Petroleum Publishing (various years). \n \nNon-energy resources \nFor bauxite, copper, gold and tin production data for 1981-1994 came from World Bureau of \nMetal Statistics (1991, 1997). For bauxite, copper and tin data for 1970-1980 came from World \nBureau of Metal Statistics (1975, 1979, 1984). For gold data for 1970-1980 came from Financial \nTimes Mining (various years). For 1970-1994 iron ore production data came from United Na-\ntions (1977, 1986, 1996). \nTime-series individual country data for proven reserves of non-energy resources are notori-\nously difficult to get hold of. A couple of short-cut formulas had to be applied therefore where \ndirect data were not available. The bias in the data is likely to be small, however, since accord-\ning to Bill Kirk from the U.S. Bureau of Mines non-energy reserves tend to be relatively constant \nover time. \nBauxite reserve data for Jamaica came from U.S. Bureau of Mines (various years) with the \nhelp of the Bureau\u2019s bauxite specialist Pat Plunkert. Copper reserve data for Zambia came from \nU.S. Bureau of Mines (various years). For Papua New Guinea individual country reserve data \nfor copper could only be established for the years 1978-1981 and 1990. For 1976-1977 reserve \ndata were approximated by world reserves in these years times the 1978 share of the country\u2019s \nreserves of world reserves. The same applies to 1982-1986 using the 1981 share and to 1987-1989 \nand 1991-1994 using the 1990 share. Individual gold reserve data for Ghana and Papua New \nGuinea could not be established. For Ghana gold reserves for 1970-1994 were approximated by \n 29 \nworld reserves in these years times the 1994 share of the country\u2019s reserves of world reserves \nwhich was provided by George J. Coackley, the U.S. Bureau of Mines\u2019 country expert for Ghana. \nFor Papua New Guinea it had to be assumed, somewhat arbitrarily, that her reserve share of \nworld gold reserves for the years 1976-1994 were equal to her production share of world gold \nproduction in the corresponding years. Iron ore reserve data for Mauritania are due to personal \ninformation from Bill Kirk from the U.S. Bureau of Mines. Tin reserve data for Bolivia for 1978-\n1994 came from Mineral Commodity Summaries (various years). For 1970-1977 reserve data \nwere approximated by world reserves in these years times the 1978 share of the country\u2019s re-\nserves of world reserves. Where necessary, world reserves were taken from Mineral Commodity \nSummaries (various years). \n 30 \nReferences \nAaheim, Asbjorn and Karine Nyborg (1995), \u2018On the Interpretation and Appli-\ncability of a \u2018Green National Product\u2019\u2019.

Strictly speaking, it is \nmisleading, if not simply wrong, to define sustainability in terms of savings. What matters for \nsustainability is investment not saving, and saving is equal to investment only for the special \ncase where there are no government expenditures. If there are government expenditures and \nno taxes, then saving equals investment plus government expenditures; or, more realistically, \nif there are taxes as well, saving plus taxes equal investment plus government expenditures. \nUsually, genuine saving is derived from dynamic optimisation models that do not include \ngovernment expenditures. For these models saving equals investment and so I will speak of \ngenuine saving rather than genuine investment in the remainder of the paper as well. \n2 All values are in current US$. For more information on the data see World Bank (1997a) and \nKunte et al. (1997), its technical documentation. \n3 Kirk Hamilton from the Bank\u2019s Environment Department is one of the main authors of World \nBank (1997a). \n4 In the following saving rates are always defined as saving divided by GNP. \n5 Note that for the saving rates of all income groups and of all regional groups, countries enter \nthe numerator with their savings and the denominator with their GNP, i.e. big countries tend \nto dominate the aggregate figures. \n6 The same reasoning applies to renewable resources if harvesting exceeds natural regeneration. \n7 By assumption, RC accrue at the beginning of the accounting period. If RC accrue at the end of \nthe accounting period, then n+1 in equation (5) would be replaced by n. \n8 I am grateful to an anonymous referee for drawing my attention on this point. \n9 Over the period 1970-1994, the approximate average oil reserves to production ratios are as \nfollows: Congo 27 years, Ecuador 21 years, Gabon 17 years, Nigeria 27 years, Trinidad and \nTobago 9 years. Mauritania\u2019s average iron ore reserves to production ratio is 34 years. \n10 Congo > 100 years, Ecuador > 100 years, Nigeria > 80 years, Trinidad and Tobago > 70 years. \nExtremely high reserves to production ratios in years of unusually low production have been \nexcluded in calculating the average in order to provide a conservative estimate. \n 36 \n                                                                                                                                               \n11 Unfortunately, their natural gas reserves are smaller in terms of share of world reserves than \ntheir oil reserves: Congo has an average share of world natural gas reserves over the period of \n1970-1994 of about 0.05% as opposed to about 0.1% share of world oil reserves; the analogous \nfigures for Ecuador are 0.12% as opposed to 0.3%; 0.07% as opposed to 0.17% for Gabon; \n1.87% as opposed to 2.35% for Nigeria. Only Trinidad and Tobago has higher natural gas than \noil reserves (0.31% versus 0.11%). \n12 Note that the EGS II-rate (El Serafy) calculates resource rents according to the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-\nmethod only for six out of a total of 30 countries. The rest enters the EGS II-rate (El Serafy) \nwith their resource rents still computed according to the World Bank method. If resource rents \nfor the other 24 countries had also been calculated according to the \u2018El Serafy\u2019-method (espe-\ncially for such important resource producers as C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and South Africa) then, no \ndoubt, the EGS II-rate (El Serafy) would have been positive throughout the period. \n13 It is unclear whether conditionality is supposed to apply to existing development aid or addi-\ntional aid. Usually, the mentioned authors simply speak of aid in general, but Atkinson et al. \n(1997, p. 207) propose \u201ea possible role for additional bilateral aid in assisting, where needed, \nthe fulfilment of genuine savings requirements\u201c (my emphasis). \n"}
