The ability to produce materials with a\nspecified morphology is highly desirable since the final\nmesoscale structure determines many of the properties of\nthe material. Polymer blends with cocontinuous and drop-\nlet structures, and block copolymers that exhibit a wide\nvariety of equilibrium and nonequilibrium morphologies,\nhave long been exploited for their enhanced mechanical\nproperties. More recently the use of two-phase blends and\ncopolymers has attracted attention for photonic [1] and\nother electronic applications [2,3]. Block copolymers\nhave particular appeal since the morphology can be con-\ntrolled by varying the ratio of the block lengths and\/or\nthe architecture. Naturally, the length scale associated\nwith the microstructure is dictated by the size of the\npolymer blocks. Although not impossible, it is nontrivial\nand costly to produce copolymers with lengths commen-\nsurate with the wavelength of light, a requirement if such\npolymers are to be used in photonic applications. Blends,\non the other hand, can phase separate with a wide range of\nlength scales ranging from tens of nanometers to hun-\ndreds of microns.\nPhase separation occurs when a polymer blend is\n\u2018\u2018quenched\u2019\u2019 from the one-phase region to the two-phase\nregion of its phase diagram. The dynamics of phase\nseparation, and hence the transient structures, depend\non whether the blend is quenched into the metastable or\nthe unstable state. In the former case, phase separation\nproceeds by nucleation and growth, resulting in droplet-\nlike structures. In the latter, the blend phase separates\nspontaneously into a cocontinuous structure with a pre-\nferred length scale dominating, a process known as spi-\nnodal decomposition.\nA more controlled approach to phase separation in\nblends was first explored by studying surface-directed\nspinodal decomposition [4]. Proceeding from this work,\na considerable effort has been devoted to the study of\nphase separation in confined geometries [5]. Of particular\npotential is the use of patterned substrates to influence\nblend morphology and to produce anisotropic phase sep-\narated structures in thin films [6\u20138]. Another possibility\nis to influence the morphology by dissolving filler par-\nticles in a blend [9,10].\nIn this Letter, we consider a simple, controllable\nmethod for producing unusual morphologies. The method\nis similar to the concept of a two step quench process,\nstudied experimentally [11\u201313]. In our model we start\nwith undissolved particles dispersed in a matrix, with the\nbulk composition being such that the blend is miscible.\nDuring dissolution the interface between the particle and\nthe matrix broadens with time and eventually disappears.\nIf the blend is then quenched into the unstable region,\nphase separation occurs, but will be greatly affected by\nthe presence of the inhomogeneities.\nWe model the kinetics of this process using the theory\ndeveloped by Cahn and Hilliard [14]. In order to empha-\nsize the underlying phenomena we consider only symmet-\nric blends, in which the two components have the same\ndegree of polymerization, N. For simplicity we neglect\nhydrodynamic effects, noting that, while these will play\nan important role in the very late stages of coarsening, the\ndevelopment of the transient morphologies should not be\nsignificantly affected. The starting point is the continuity\nequation: the rate of change of concentration in a given\nvolume element is equal to the divergence of the flux of\nmaterial into the element. The flux is then assumed to be\nproportional to the gradient of the chemical potential\ndifference between the two components. The Cahn-\nHilliard model was modified by Cook [15] to include\nthe effects of thermal noise, and later modified for poly-\nmeric systems [16\u201318]. The simplest version appropriate\nto symmetric polymer blends is [19]\n@\u0003\u0001r; t\u0002\n@t\n\u0003 r \u0005D\u0003\u00011\u0006\u0003\u0002r\n\u0001\n\u0007Fmixf\u0003\u0001r; t\u0002g\n\u0007\u0003\n\u0002\n\t\t\u0001r; t\u0002;\n(1)\nwhere \u0003\u0001r; t\u0002 is the local volume fraction of component A,\nFmixf\u0003\u0001r; t\u0002g is the free energy of mixing, and \t\u0001r; t\u0002 is the\nthermal noise.

It is straightforward\nto numerically solve Eq. (3) by the finite difference\nmethod; details are given in Ref. [19]. The inclusion of\nthe noise term greatly increases the computation time and\nis believed not to affect the general behavior. However,\nnoise is necessary for the phase separation to occur\nfollowing a quench into the two-phase region, since the\nabove equations will not evolve from a truly homogenous\nmixture. It is standard practice to generate these varia-\ntions by adding a small random fluctuation in volume\nfraction to each lattice site at the start of a simulation\nonly. Such an approach has been shown to reproduce\nmany of the features associated with phase separation\nin polymer blends [19].\nWe have solved Eq. (3) for a mixture of circular par-\nticles of one component in a matrix of the other compo-\nnent. We work in two dimensions, using periodic\nboundary conditions. The logarithmic terms in the free\nenergy give rise to numerical instabilities if the concen-\ntration of the matrix is \u0003B \u0003 0 and that of the particles is\n\u0003B \u0003 1, so we choose a matrix with \u0003B \u0003 0:05 and\nparticles with \u0003B \u0003 0:95. Also to improve stability, we\nsmooth the boundary between particles and matrix by\nsetting the concentration at any point on the discretized\ngrid to be the average over that of immediate nearest\nneighbors. Such stability problems should be improved\nby the use of more sophisticated numerical schemes (such\nas the finite element method). The particles are placed at\nrandom on the grid, such that no particles overlap. The\neffects of interparticle correlations are not considered in\nthis Letter, but may have interesting consequences, par-\nticularly if the length scale of phase separation is similar\nto that of interparticle spacing.\nThe dissolution process corresponds to \u0011< \u0011s, so that\nthe blend is in the one-phase region. During dissolution\nthe blend is quenched into the two-phase region; i.e., we\napply a step change in \u0011, so that \u0011 > \u0011s. Because of the\nscaling, the conversion from the dimensionless spatial\nvariable to real space is determined by j\u0011\u0006 \u0011sj. In order\nto simplify the numerical procedure, and to avoid having\nto rescale the lattice, we choose j\u0011\u0006 \u0011sj to be the same\nbefore and after the quench. When the quench is applied,\nthe volume fraction at each point on the grid is modified\nby a small random amount (\u000b 0:0005), to mimic the\nthermal noise. Figure 1 shows a series of snapshots from\nFIG. 1. Development of the morphology following the\nquench into the spinodal region (R \u0003 16).

The grey scale range, which is the same for all snapshots, is\nsuch that white represents regions of pure A, and black repre-\nsents regions of pure B.\nVOLUME 89, NUMBER 21 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 18 NOVEMBER 2002\n215506-2 215506-2\na solution of 21 particles of component B each of radius\nR \u0003 16 lattice steps placed on a 2562 grid, so that the\nvolume fraction of B is \u0003B \f 0:29. The spatial and tem-\nporal steps were \u000ex \u0003 0:25 and \u000e\u0015 \u0003 0:002, respectively.\nDifferent step sizes were also studied to ensure that the\nresults were not an artifact of the discretization. N was\nchosen to be 200; hence, the spinodal corresponds to \u0011s \u0003\n0:0121, and we choose j\u0011\u0006 \u0011sj \u0003 0:000 24. From the\nscaling parameters the radius of the particles is \r250b,\nand b is typically of the order of angstroms. Immediately\nafter the quench, applied when \u0015=\u000e\u0015 \u0003 6000, it is clear\nthat the particles are not fully dissolved. During the phase\nseparation, the wavelength selection process associated\nwith spinodal decomposition leads to a core rich in com-\nponent A developing within a shell of component B; it can\nbe seen that the difference in volume fraction between the\ntwo becomes quite significant. For such a core to develop\nit is essential that the size of the particle is larger than the\ninitial preferred wavelength of phase separation, \u001bm,\ndetermined by linearizing Eq. (3) for small fluctuations,\nfrom which it can be shown that \u001bm \f 2\u001d=\n\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006\n18\u0003\u00011\u0006\u0003\u0002p ,\ni.e., 2R=\u001bm \f 2:5. In Fig. 2, the time dependence of a\ntypical cross section through one of the particles is illus-\ntrated. During dissolution, the volume fraction at the\ncenter of the particle reduces to \u0003B \r 0:7, and the inter-\nface between the phases broadens. After quenching, the\nsize of the core does not change significantly, although its\nconcentration does; first \u0003B decreases to a minimum of\n\r0:25 at \u0015=\u000e\u0015 \u0003 6000, before starting to increase.\nCoarsening of the core is prevented by the surrounding\nshell; it is more favorable for polymers within the core to\ndiffuse through the shell into the surrounding matrix.\nEventually the core disappears and the particles become\nuniformly rich in component B. The dynamics of the\nprocess, as well as the effect of varying the time at which\nthe quench is applied on the core-shell structure, is fur-\nther explored in Fig. 3. In each case, the core develops\nafter \f 200 time steps, indicative of the time required for\na structure to develop from the random fluctuations, and\nthe core-shell structure becomes most prominent after \f\n1000\u20132000 time steps. In the inset, the maximum differ-\nence between \u0003B in the core and shell, that occurs during\nthe quench, is shown for three different initial particle\nsizes, as a function of quench time. For R \u0003 16 a quench\napplied at \u0015=\u000e\u0015 \f 6000 results in the possibility of the\nmost distinct structures. If the quench is too soon, i.e.,\n\u0015=\u000e\u0015 & 1000, after dissolution has started, the particles\nwill simply act as nucleation sites for the phase separa-\ntion; no significant core develops. If too much dissolution\nis allowed, i.e., \u0015=\u000e\u0015 \f 16 000, then phase separation\nwill proceed as if from a homogenous blend. If the\nparticle is too small, e.g., R \u0003 12, compared to \u001bm, the\ncore-shell structure will not be too well developed. On\nthe other hand, for R \u0003 20, it is clear that a large range of\nquench times will result in a well defined core-shell\nmorphology.\nParticles with a greater radius than R \u0003 20 develop\nmore complex structures, as illustrated in Fig. 4, for\n20 particles rich in component B, each of radius 32 lattice\nsteps. The grid size is 5122, so that the volume fraction of\nB is \u0003B \f 0:27. \u000ex, \u000e\u0015, and N were the same as in the\nprevious simulation. The spinodal boundary is now \u0011s \u0003\n0:0125, and we choose j\u0011\u0006 \u0011sj \u0003 0:000 26. Because of\nthe larger size of the particles the quench was applied\nwhen \u0015=\u000e\u0015 \u0003 20 000. The larger particle size corre-\nsponds to 2R=\u001bm \f 5, enabling concentric rings of con-\ncentration to evolve. The snapshots suggest that there\nexists a central core rich in A, surrounded by three rings,\nFIG. 2.

The inset shows how the maximum difference varies\nas a function of the time at which the quench is applied for\nthree different initial particle sizes.\nVOLUME 89, NUMBER 21 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 18 NOVEMBER 2002\n215506-3 215506-3\nrich in B, A, and B, respectively. The ring of component A\neventually breaks up, leaving several small droplets\nwithin the particles, roughly equidistant from the cen-\nter. Again, coarsening eventually leads to homogenous\nparticles.\nIn summary, we have modeled a two-stage dissolution-\nquench process. Unusual transient morphologies develop,\nwhich, if frozen, may lead to useful material properties.\nAlthough there are a number of parameters that can be\nvaried for any given system, the presented results indicate\nthat the appearance of such structures is ubiquitous. In\nfuture work we will elaborate further on the effect of\nchanging the various parameters, including the quench\ndepth, on the detailed nature of the process. Importantly,\nfrom a technological viewpoint, the difference between\nthe composition of the core and the shell can be large, and\nwe have quantifiably (at least in terms of the reduced\nvariables) shown how, for a fixed quench depth, the core-\nshell structure may be maximized by varying (i) the time\nat which the quench is applied, and (ii) the time at which\nthe sample is frozen and morphology development ar-\nrested. It is the former that, if suitably chosen, allows\nfor greater control over the morphology. Significantly, the\noptimum time to arrest structural development does not\nvary noticeably with the time at which the quench is\napplied. We have shown that an important dimension-\nless parameter for targeting particular morphologies is\n2R=\u001bm. The preferred initial length scale \u001bm can be tuned\nexperimentally by varying the quench depth. The greater\nthe quench depth, the smaller the \u001bm. Our results suggest\nthat a guideline for producing single core-shell particles\nis 3:5 * 2R=\u001bm * 1:5. For particles smaller than this no\ncore develops, whereas more complex morphologies result\nfor larger particles.\n*Electronic address: nigel.clarke@durham.ac.uk\n[1] A. C. Edrington, A. M.
