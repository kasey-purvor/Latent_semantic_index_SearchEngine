How is diversity addressed? How is power problematized? Positivist tradition Life is approximated to traditional nuclear family. Diversity is  not addressed. Power relations are not problematized. Individualbased explanations are offered. Critical tradition A broader conception of family is often adopted to include single parents and extended family. But papers still focus on domestic life and heterosexual relations. Diversity is mentioned but mainly limited to a single strand and most of the time gender. Historical and structural power relations are taken into account, but the analyses remained limited due lack of intersectional perspective.

Sampling strategy  Sampling represents varied experiences of work and life Sampling reflects demographic diversity in the chosen context Sampling takes into account the inequality in access to power and resources as well as contextual influences. Groups are chosen not according to fixed categories, but in terms of their access to power in a specific context. Operationalization  Develop and use new measures to account for nontraditional forms of household and non-domestic components of life. Investigate the interplay between strands of diversity. Consider power and resource differentials between groups and different types of households, rather than reducing variables to individual level characteristics.

This \npaper provides a critical review of the work-life literature from 1990 onwards through the lens of \ndiversity, with particular focus on disparities of power induced by methodological and \nconceptual framings of work and life.  Our review seeks to answer the following questions: What \nare the gaps and omissions in the work-life research? How may they be overcome?  To answer \nthese questions we scrutinize blind spots in treatment of life, diversity and power in work-life \nresearch both in positivist and critical scholarship. In order to transcend the blind spots in \npositivist and critical work-life research, we argue the case for an intersectional approach, which \ncaptures the changing realities of family and workforce through the lens of diversity and \nintersectionality. Our theoretical contribution is three fold: First, our review demonstrates that \ncontemporary framing of life in the work-life literature should be expanded to cover aspects of \nlife beyond domestic life. Second, our review explains why and how other strands of diversity \nthan gender also manifest as salient causes of difference in experiences of the work-life interface. \nThird, our review reveals that social and historical context has more explanatory power on work-\nlife dynamics than micro-individual level of explanations. Work-life literature should capture the \ndynamism in these contexts. We also provide a set of useful recommendations to capture and \noperationalize methodological and theoretical changes required in the work-life literature. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCite as: \u00d6zbilgin, M., Beauregard, T.

Studies of \nthe work-life interface are concerned with \u201cthe relationship between the institutional and cultural \ntimes and spaces of work and non-work in societies where income is predominantly generated \nand distributed through labour markets\u201d (Felstead et al. 2002, p. 56). Work-life research explores \nthe antecedents, correlates and consequences of the balance, conflict, and facilitation between \u2013 \nas well as integration of \u2013 work and non-work domains. Numerous studies demonstrate that the \nwork-life interface has important individual and organizational outcomes (Allis and O'Driscoll \n2008; Casper and Harris 2008; Giardini and Kabst 2008; Glover and Crooker 1995; Ilies, Wilson \nand Wagner 2009; Lapierre et al. 2008; Milliken, Dutton and Beyer 1990; Muse, Harris, Giles \nand Feild 2008; Parker and Allen 2001; Pratt and Rosa 2003; Rijswijk, Bekker, Rutte and Croon \n2004; Williams and Alliger 1994). There have been reviews of the work-life literature (e.g. \nBakker, Westman and van Emmerik 2009; Casper, Eby, Bordeaux, Lockwood and Lambert \n2007; Eby, Casper, Lockwood, Bordeaux and Brinley 2005; Kossek and Ozeki 1998; Perry-\nJenkins, Repetti and Crouter 2000). However, none of these reviews has approached the \nliterature from the perspective of diversity in demography and household structures. We suggest \nthat the work-life literature engenders theoretical and practical limitations due to the implicit \nassumptions confining the research to a narrow group of employees and traditional family \nstructures.  \n \nIn her analyses of reinvention of the family in contemporary societies, Beck-Gernsheim (2002) \nargues that the nuclear family has been replaced with an expansion of the family concept, due to \n 3 \nincreased rates of divorce and recently legitimized lifestyles based on co-habitation, same-sex \npartnerships, and extended families of lineage and choice. Beck-Gernsheim (2002) considers \nindividuals with these new lifestyles as travelers between cultures, and points to the destabilizing \noutcomes of their novel forms of life and lifestyles on the dominant order. She concludes that:  \n   \n\u2026people who move between cultures and nations really do constitute a problem of \norder, in one sense at least. For they might infect others with their \u2018recalcitrance\u2019 \u2013 \nand this makes them \u2018unreliable\u2019 and suspicious. They are a source of danger, \nseabeds of resistance. They may dare to look across the frontiers, to see through \ntheir arbitrary and the random nature, to resist the power of habit. That makes them \na nuisance. This is subversion. Might they, the ones who do not belong, here and \nthere burst the \u2018iron cage of serfdom\u2019? That would be truly impertinent and \nunforgivable \u2013 if indeed they were to succeed (Beck-Gernsheim 2002: p. 138).   \n   \nIn this paper, we bring to the fore the experience of the excluded groups, which Beck-Gernsheim \nso aptly recognizes as enemies of the established order. Documenting the exclusion and \notherness that traditional framing of the work-life literature induces, we identify ways to \novercome exclusionary tendencies in this literature. Our aim in this review is to critically revisit \nthe work-life literature through the lenses of diversity and intersectionality, to reveal the blind \nspots and gaps in this literature, and to suggest new directions for research to render this field \nmore inclusive and relevant to the realities of contemporary societies and organizations. Our \nintention in doing so is to demonstrate that contemporary theorization of the work-life interface \nshould be aligned with the reality of work-life experiences in labor markets, which are \n 4 \nundergoing increased heterogeneity due to the inclusion of traditionally excluded groups and \npromulgation of regulatory controls for accommodation of such diversity. Excluding non-\ntraditional forms of family and the experiences of minority employees from research of the \nwork-life interface hampers the explanatory power of the work-life literature\u2019s theoretical \ndevelopment and empirical results, and reduces their relevance for real life situations.  \n \nOur paper is based on the premise that making the conceptualization of the work-life interface \nmore akin to the nature of reality on the ground would render organizational change initiatives to \nimprove work-life arrangements more effective.  If initiatives are designed and implemented \nwithout considering the needs and household structures of large proportions of the population, \nthose initiatives will necessarily be less than effective. Therefore, we pose the following \nquestion: What are the gaps and omissions in the work-life research and how may they be \novercome?  Answering these two connected questions requires us to review the existing research \nto chart out not only what is included in the literature but also what is left out. To do this, we \nscrutinize the treatment of \u2018life\u2019, diversity and relations of power in two distinct camps of the \nwork-life literature: the positivist and critical approaches to work-life research. In the first part of \nthe paper, our methodological approach and selection of research papers are presented.  Then, we \nprovide our analysis of the work-life research, identifying the omissions that originate from the \nexisting treatment of \u2018life\u2019, diversity and power. Finally, based on these expositions and our \nreading of the critical management literature, we suggest an intersectional approach as a way \nforward in the work-life research for developing more inclusive and robust measures (variables \nand proxies) and analysis to capture the changing realities of domestic life in contemporary \nsocieties.  \n 5 \nMETHODS \n \nOur framing of the interface between work and life brings together and draws on a broad range \nof concepts which comprise the work-life literature, including work-life balance, work-life \nconflict, and both positive and negative spillover in the context of work and non-work domains. \nIn doing so, we particularly focus on the framing of \u2018life\u2019, i.e. domestic and family life as well as \nother non-work pursuits in the work-life literature. Although there are scholarly works that \nexplain the expansion of the concept of life (Beck and Beck-Gernsheim 2001; Bengtson 2001; \nKossek, Lewis and Hammer 2010), these are not translated into useable variables in field studies \non work-life issues. Our paper is based on the premise that failing to offer conceptions of family \nand other non-work related involvement that are closer to reality leads to legitimization, \nprioritization, and ultimately reification of \"traditional\" forms of family in social and \norganizational theorization and policy making, which in turn fail to serve growing, albeit \u201cnon-\ntraditional,\u201d forms of family.  \n \nTo provide a comprehensive and critical review of the literature on work-life balance, we \nconducted a series of searches using the ISI Web of Knowledge database, which includes all \njournals in the Social Science Citation Index. Using the key words of work-life, work-family, \nbalance, interface, conflict, fit, integration and spillover, we searched for peer-reviewed journal \narticles focusing on the nexus of work and life. Our initial research returned 1195 articles in \nsocial science fields. We then limited the coverage only to works categorized as articles and \nreviews written in English (although this is admittedly problematic\u2014see Adler and Harzing, \n2009) in the selected areas (psychology, behavioral sciences, business and management, \n 6 \nsociology, family studies and women's studies) from 1990, which reduced the number of studies \nto 548. We chose 1990 as the cut-off point because: (a) an analysis of the publication date data \ndisplays a consistent academic interest in work-life issues from 1990 onwards, and (b) similarly \nthe data show that the year also corresponds to the time when diversity research started to \nproliferate in management studies. Finally, in order to ensure a review of high impact studies, we \neliminated the articles from journals with an impact factor below 1.00, with the exception of \njournals that frequently published papers on work-life studies (see Table 1).  \n------------------------------ \nInsert Table 1 about here \n------------------------------ \n \nOur list of articles includes 397 work-life studies with original empirical data. We read \napproximately 50 per cent of the articles in the list and identified common thematic patterns. \nOnce we did this, we surveyed the remaining stock of publications for evidence of similar \npatterns. We also identified studies that are exceptional in their efforts to bring in more inclusive \nconceptions of the work-life interface in their theorisation and methodological approaches.  \n \nOur analysis is rooted in a critical social science approach, which aims to generate deep insights \nwith the ultimate aim of changing the world. More profound insights are fostered in critical \nsocial science by going beyond surface level issues, in an attempt to reveal deeper structures in \nsocial life (Fay 1987). Power is an integral focus of the examination of deep structures for \ncritical social scientists as they seek to explicate imparities of power in organizations and \nregulation of social, economic, and political life. In line with this tradition, critical social science \n 7 \nprovides a lens through which critical management scholars examine power relations which are \nexplicitly and implicitly connected to the praxis (theory and practice) of management and its \nvariants (e.g. Cooke 2004). Fournier and Grey (2000) explain that what sets critical management \naside from other management approaches is its intention to question what is considered natural \nand normal in management discourses. This is achieved through critique of relations of power \ninherent in social systems and structures with a firm commitment to making a difference through \nfacilitating emancipation (Grice and Humphries 1997). Connell (1987) differentiates between the \nnaked power, which is enacted through visible use of force, and deeper structural power. The \ndeeper structural power functions as a social structure that delivers resources, opportunities, and \nconstraints. In line with this argument, we performed a critical analysis of the work-life \nliterature, drawing on Minger\u2019s (2000: 219) four principles: namely, we have read with a healthy \n\u2018scepticism towards rhetoric, tradition, authority and objectivity\u2019 of this literature. We have not \nused techniques of systematic review, as statistical meta-analyses (e.g. Kossek and Ozeki 1999) \nare more appropriate for investigating the strength of relationships among variables. Rather, our \nintention was to examine implicit assumptions in a body of literature, i.e.. to provide a critical \nreview of the work-life literature.    \n \nBLIND SPOTS IN WORK-LIFE RESEARCH \n \nThe relationship between theory and policy is the subject of long debate in the social sciences. \nConcepts created in social science such as motivation, performance, job satisfaction, as well as \nthose associated with the work-life interface, are attempts at understanding and framing the \nregularities of social phenomena. They, subject to their relative success, are adopted and used in \n 8 \nvarying degrees for carving out social and organizational policy, informing the way management \ninterventions are realized in practice (Hilgartner 1990; Maranta, Guggenheim, Gisler and Pohl \n2003). Nevertheless, across disciplines of social sciences, concepts (including the work-life \ninterface) are defined in diverse ways. Each definition competes for dominance and adoption, as \nit is imbued with a different set of assumptions, which call for concomitant configurations of \npower relations (Connell 1987). If they are not grounded in evidence, assumptions that underpin \nthe work-life literature would diverge the research and practice from the reality (Swanberg \n2004). For example, Sullivan and Lewis (2001) demonstrate that organizational practices which \nare founded on assumptions of gender differences serve to perpetuate these difference codes, \nalthough they appear to expand choice at first sight. In the same way, Swanberg (2004) warns us \nof the negative consequences of gendered assumptions regarding management of the work-life \ninterface. We therefore suggest that the blind spots in the work-life literature render theorisation \nincomplete, and cause practices which rely on these incomplete representations to fail or to \nperpetuate skewed representations of reality. We provide a review of the gaps in the work-life \nresearch across the divide of positivist and critical approaches. Table 2 summarises the treatment \nof \u2018life\u2019, diversity and power in work-life research in both the positivist and critical traditions. \n------------------------------ \nInsert Table 2 about here \n------------------------------ \n \n \nOur review of the critical and positivist work-life research scrutinizes the treatment of three key \nareas: \u2018life\u2019, diversity and power. We argue that these three dimensions are crucial to understand \n 9 \nthe work-life issues that face societies, organisations and institutions as well as to reveal the \nimplicit conventions in academic research on the work-life interface. Thus, we pose three \nquestions, each relating to one of these three key areas: (a) How is \u2018life\u2019 conceptualized? (b) \nHow is diversity addressed? and (c) How is power problematized? In answering these three \nquestions, our review suggests that there are three major areas of concern in the positivist work-\nlife studies, the majority of which are published in US journals: (a) approximation of 'life' to \ndomestic life and nuclear family life, (b) inattention to multiple strands of difference, and (c) \nfailure to attend to the impact of historical and structural power imbalances on work-life issues. \nOn the other hand, our review of the critical literature shows that the critical approach responds \nto some of the gaps in the positivist research. In particular, the critical work-life literature attends \nto power issues and presents a broader conception of family to include single parent and \nextended families. There are also exemplary studies that problematize the work-life interface \nalong the fault lines of race and ethnicity. However, the critical tradition too suffers from some \nflaws similar to that we find in the positivist literature, as it (a) largely overlooks non-domestic \ndimensions of life, (b) mainly focuses on a single strand of diversity, which is usually gender, \nand (c) offers a limited analysis of power due to the lack of intersectional analysis of complex \nand contextual relationality between different forms of diversity. In the next two sections, we \nelaborate on these blind spots in positivist and critical work-life research uncovered by our \nreview.  \n \n 10 \nPositivist Tradition of Work-Life Research \nThe majority of the articles included in our review represent the positivist social science research \ntradition. This is not surprising given the general dominance of positivist scholarship in the area \nof management and organization studies. In this tradition, there is a widespread assumption that \n\u2018life\u2019 stands for domestic life and particularly for family life, as there are numerous studies that \ndeal solely with work-family issues (e.g. Carlson, Kacmar, Wayne and Grzywacz 2000; Fagnani \nand Letablier 2004; Greenhaus and Beutell 1985; Greenhaus and Powell 2006; Parasuraman, \nGreenhaus and Granrose 1992), cutting out other aspects of life outside the family. Eby et al.\u2019s \nreview of the work-family literature identifies the \u201cvirtual omission\u201d (2005: 185) of non-work \nfactors such as leisure activities, community involvement, religious affiliation, volunteer \ncommitments, and the support of extended family. []Studies involving social support in the \ncontext of the work-life interface focus on support from supervisors and immediate family \nmembers (e.g. Cook 2009; Dupre and Day 2007; Foley, Linnehan, Greenhaus and Weer 2006; \nFrone and Yardley 1996; Karatepe and Kilic 2007; Seiger and Wiese 2009; Thomas and Ganster \n1995; van Daalen, Willemsen and Sanders 2006), despite the importance of sources such as \nfriends and neighbors that are acknowledged by the stress and coping literature (Walen and \nLachman 2000).  \n \nA number of researchers have called for the examination of inappropriate assumptions which \nunderpin the work life balance literature (Pitt-Catsouphes and Christensen 2004) and adoption of \nmore accurate conceptualizations of family when exploring the relationship between work and \nthe rest of life (Beauregard, \u00d6zbilgin and Bell 2009; Moen and Sweet 2004; Voydanoff 1988, \n2005). However, in the mainstream positivist tradition, the samples used to study the work-life \n 11 \ninterface remain predominantly composed of individuals who are members of traditional nuclear \nfamilies (Aryee and Luk 1996 a,b; Aryee, Luk, Leung and Lo 1999; Craig, Mullen and Blaxland \n2010; Desrochers, Hilton and Larwood 2005; Rothausen 1999). Furthermore, there is a tendency \nto focus on matrimonial relationships of women in particular  (e.g. Noor 2002, 2004), as if the \nexperiences and expectations of domestic life of men and single people do not matter.  \n \nThere do exist studies that take into consideration caring responsibilities for dependents other \nthan the participants\u2019 offspring (e.g., Beauregard 2009; Hyman, Scholarios and Baldry 2005;). \nHowever, the majority of work-life research focuses on parental responsibilities for young \nchildren (e.g., Cousins and Tang 2004; Dikkers et al., 2007). Consequently, the concept of \nfamily in the positivist work-life literature often specifically refers to a traditional family unit, \nmade up of a man, a woman and children. Even methodologically innovative research, such as \nClark\u2019s (2002) exploration of communication across the borders of work and family, adopts a \nlimited and exclusive definition of significant family responsibilities, demarcating them to \nresponsibilities for \u201ca spouse, children, or care of another family member such as an elderly \nparent\u201d (p. 32).  In their recent review of research methods in the work-life literature, Casper et \nal. (2007) found that married individuals comprised 83% of study samples in 225 studies \npublished between 1980 and 2003, and that parents of dependent children accounted for \n77%. This means that people who are outside of the traditional family structure are less likely to \nbe depicted in the work-life literature. These patterns of sampling which approximate \u2018life\u2019 to \ndomestic life and nuclear family present a significant misrepresentation in the light of the \nstatistical evidence. For example, in the U.S., about 17% of married couple families are \ncomposed of working men and unemployed wives, 26% of all households in the United States \n 12 \nare headed by single women, and nearly 5% of married couple families are composed of working \nwomen and unemployed husbands (USDL, 2004). \n \nMost studies in the positivist tradition implicitly assume that management of the work-life \ninterface is either merely a women\u2019s problem or an issue of gender relations. Therefore, the \nconceptual development in this field has remained stunted in terms of making work-life issues \nrelevant across divisions of social diversity, beyond gender diversity (e.g. Aryee 1992, 1999; \nAryee, Luk and Stone 1998; Bagger, Li and Gutek 2008; Carlson, Grzywacz, and Kacmar 2010; \nChiu and Ng 1999; Day and Chamberlain 2006; Gustafson 2006). On the other hand, high rates \nof female labor force participation mean that (heterosexual) men are experiencing growing \ntensions between work and family responsibilities, and should therefore not be discounted from \nresearch in this area (Glass and Estes 1997; Gambles, Lewis and Rapoport 2006). Thus far, just \nas men\u2019s non-work needs are generally neglected in the workplace (Lewis, Gambles and \nRapoport 2007), attempts to include men in work-life studies have been few and far between \n(e.g. Bygren and Duvander 2006; Grandey, Cordeiro and Michael 2007; Higgins and Duxbury \n1992; Hughes and Bozionelos 2007; Lingard and Francis 2005).  \n \nThere is also a dearth of research on work-life issues among black and minority ethnic groups, \nsexual minorities, or people with disabilities, all of whom remain marginal to the mainstream \nthinking, leaving their experiences under-theorized. There is undoubtedly much knowledge lost \nwhen surveys completed by workers with nontraditional family responsibilities are discounted \nand their results not analyzed or published, considering that these groups which are excluded are \nno longer small minorities in contemporary labor markets. What little research there is that \n 13 \nfocuses on these excluded groups suggests that their experiences may be different or take place \nunder different circumstances than those of the mainstream samples (Day and Schonerade 1997; \nPerrone 2005; Saltzstein, Ting and Saltzstein 2001). For example, in one of the few studies \nwhich looked at possible sexual orientation differences, Day and Schonerade\u2019s (1997) \ninvestigation of work-family conflict found no differences between heterosexual employees and \nlesbian and gay employees who were \u2018out\u2019 in the workplace, but that non-disclosed lesbian and \ngay workers experienced significantly higher levels of work-family conflict than either of the \ntwo other groups.  \n \nUnsurprisingly, research on the work-life interface is also largely characterized with assumptions \nof heteronormativity and compulsory heterosexuality (Rich 1980), in which framing of concepts \nexclude non-heterosexual experience. For example, Burley (1995, p. 488) limits his sample of \ndual career couples to heterosexual partners: \u2018\u2026respondents had to be involved in dual career \nrelationship, which was defined as a heterosexual relationship in which the partners are currently \nliving together but not necessarily married, (and) both partners had to be devoted to 20 or more \nhours per week to paid work activities\u2019. Another example is the Crossfield, Kinman and Jones \n(2005) investigation of crossover stress in dual-career couples, which involved exclusively \nheterosexual couples, the majority of whom occupied professional or managerial work roles. \nThere is indeed a common pattern to ignore non-heterosexual partnership across the studies on \ndual earners (e.g. Barnett, Gareis and Brennan 2008; Demerouti, Bakker and Schaufeli 2005; \nHammer, Allen and Grigsby 1997; Ilies et al. 2009), although non- heterosexual couples\u2019 work-\nlife experiences and access to benefits are vastly different. For example, in the U.S., same sex \npartnerships are not included in the primary work-family legislation (e.g., Family and Medical \n 14 \nLeave Act).  As many organizations model their benefits on legislated relationships, sexual \nminorities are also denied access to leave and other benefits requiring governmental \nauthorization of marriage.  \n \nThe same pattern of omitting and selective inclusion takes place across other strands of diversity. \nNotwithstanding the recent interest in cultural and cross-national differences in management of \nthe work life interface, as well as an increasing number of work-life studies in non-Western \ncontexts (e.g. Aryee, Fields and Luk 1999; Choi 2008; Coffey, Anderson, Zhao, Liu and Zhang \n2009; Hill, Yang, Hawkins and Ferris 2004; Luk and Shaffer 2005; Mortazavi, Pedhiwala, \nShafiro and Hammer 2009; Namasivayma and Zhao 2007; Spector et al. 2007), Casper et al. \n(2007) recommend expanding the participant base of work-life research to include more racial \nand ethnic minorities.  Differences in the experience of work-life issues and in non-work related \nresponsibilities exist among different racial and ethnic groups (Kamenou 2008; Roehling, Jarvis \nand Swope 2005; Yang, Chen, Choi and Zou 2000). For example, Dale (2005) in her qualitative \nstudy of work-life balance among Pakistani and Bangladeshi women living in the UK, concluded \nthat in comparison with their white counterparts, these ethnic minority women are faced with \ngreater difficulties in reconciling employment and family responsibilities due to the cultural \ncontexts of both work, which is geared toward Western social and religious mores, and home, \nwhere expectations of women as caretakers of the household and family remain onerous. Yang, \nChen, Choi and Zou (2000) also identify a significant cultural difference in work and family \ndemands and conflict among American and Chinese workers. These differences have, however,  \nreceived little research attention in the mainstream positivist literature (Casper, Eby, Bordeaux, \nLockwood and Lambert 2007).   \n 15 \n \nThe positivist tradition\u2019s failure to address the diversity of employee backgrounds and \nexperiences, combined with its approximation of \u2018life\u2019 to a traditional nuclear family, can be \nattributed to the often hidden White middle class bias of this strand of research. This bias leads to \nignorance of the power dynamics shaping the work-life issues that are pertinent in contemporary \nworkplaces and to an overwhelming focus on the analysis of individual level variables at the \nexpense of explanations that deal with historical and structural power relations at societal and \norganizational levels. Several scholars (Burke 2004; Caprioni 2004; Crompton, Brockmann and \nLyonette 2005; Fuwa and Cohen 2007; Halrynjo and Lyng 2009; Hyman and Summers 2004; \nLewis 1997; Lewis et al. 2007; Ollier-Malaterre 2010; Perlow 1995; Peters and Heusinkveld \n2010; Tomlinson 2007) have criticized the mainstream work-life research for its almost \nexclusive focus on individual choice in explaining antecedents, correlates, and consequences of \nwork-life issues, arguing that structural and institutional conditions play an important role in \naccounting for work-life outcomes. Still, the majority of the empirical studies in the field focus \non individual level factors, trivializing much wider power issues (e.g. Blanch and Aluia 2009; \nBoyar and Mosley 2007; Carlson 1999; Grandey, Cordeiro and Crouter 2005; Gropel and Kuhl \n2009; Kinnunen, Vermulst, Gerris and Makikangas 2003; Mitchelson 2009). The relevance of \nsocial and structural factors and power imbalances for management of the work-life interface is \nevident in the findings of research which suggest that individuals who occupy privileged \npositions in society, e.g. managerial and professional employees, enjoy greater access to \norganizational work-life policies than their lower-income, lower-status counterparts (Casper et \nal. 2007). This is consistent with empirical evidence suggesting that employees with higher \nlevels of education and higher incomes have better access to organizational work-life policies \n 16 \n(Swanberg, et al. 2005), and demonstrates that factors reflective of individuals' status in society \nplay a key role in determining employees' experiences of the work-life interface, calling for a \nrobust analysis of power. Therefore, ontological and methodological designs of work-life studies \nneed to account not only for demographic diversity and non-traditional non-work commitments \nbut also for the structural and historical power relations in the societies and organizations.   \n \nCritical Tradition of Work-Life Research \nThe critical tradition of work-life research scrutinizes the positivist treatment of the subject, and \noffers a way of exploring the work-life interface which in the main overcomes the flaws and \nblind spots in the mainstream literature. Particularly, feminist scholarship has a long-standing \ncritical tradition of documenting inequalities in the organization of work and life. As women\u2019s \ndisadvantage in both the work and domestic domains have been the central focus of the earliest \nexamples of work-life studies, feminist scholarship forms the historical backbone of work-life \nresearch. Women\u2019s inclusion in sectors of paid employment and work is now an indisputable fact \nacross industrialized countries. Despite this change in the world of work, feminist scholarship \nhas documented that gender relations at the domestic sphere have been resistant to change as \ndomestic work has remained largely women\u2019s work (Hoschild 1989; Shelton, 1992). \nFurthermore, there has been little transformation in the organization of paid work as long \nworking hours and other structural conditions of work, which were originally designed to fit \naround men's lives, continue to circumscribe women\u2019s success in careers and attainment of work-\nlife balance (Albrecht 2003; Brown and Jones 2004; Guillaume and Pochic 2009; MacInnes \n2005; Rapoport, Bailyn, Fletcher and Pruitt 2002; Ozbilgin and Woodward 2004; Pocock 2005; \nWatts 2009).  \n 17 \n \nAttending to wider social policy concerns, Cobble (2004) explained that differences in family \npolicy between the US and European countries is due to different historical trajectories of \nfeminist, religious, conservative and progressive politics. In her examination of work and family \nlife in contemporary societies, Crompton (2006) explains that families in the UK and the US \nexperience higher levels of work-life conflict when compared to continental European countries \nwhere there are structural supports for childcare and other supportive arrangements for \nmanagement of the work-life interface. While structural conditions do influence the work-life \ninterface, analyses offered by Crompton (2006) and others (e.g. Auer and Welte 2009; Brandth \nand Kvande 2002; Burke 2000; Emslie and Hunt 2009; Gr\u00f6nlund 2007; Halrynjo 2009; Kvande \n2009; Nordenmark 2002; Russell, O'Connell and McGinnity 2009; Warren, Fox and Pascall \n2009; Williams, Pocock and Skinner 2008) suffer from inattention to issues of social fault-lines \nother than gender, and these critical assessments of work and family in contemporary societies \nexclude other salient diversity categories such as ethnicity, class, and sexuality. In fact, the \ntendency to view management of the work-life interface predominantly as a gender issue is one \nof the flaws that the majority of feminist work-life research shares with the positivist tradition. \nIndeed, the success of gender analyses of work-life research has almost held this field hostage to \nfortune, drawing out analyses across other strands of diversity. One possible charge for this \npattern is the pecking order in the feminist scholarship (Forson 2007), in which White Western \nfeminists dominate the field and crowd out other feminist voices. \n \nOne of the most silenced areas in both positivist and critical work-life research relates to the \nexperiences of religious minorities and non-heterosexual individuals. Despite relatively \n 18 \nantagonistic and negative relations between advocates of sexual orientation and religious \nequality, both sexual orientation and religion (as well as spirituality and belief) present salient \nforms of diversity in understanding the work-life interface. Weeks (1986) explains that the social \nand economic regulation of sexuality has significant consequences of sexualized disadvantage at \nwork and home for sexual minorities.  Given that most of the organizational work-life policies \nare designed with heterosexual couples in mind, same-sex couples are denied equality of \nbenefits. On the other hand, the practice of religion and spirituality in the context of workplaces \nis one of the hotly debated issues of recent years (Miller 2007). Religion and tradition have \nhistorically informed the organization of work and rest periods in contemporary societies. \nAlthough the religious logics are at the foundation of the way we organize our work and non-\nwork today, religion does not feature as the major influence in the way the work-life interface is \norganized in contemporary societies. In the context of increased diversity of individuals of \ndifferent faiths, religious beliefs and none in cosmopolitan centers, work-life research needs to \nrecognize inequities and disadvantages which dominant structures of work and life can present to \nmembers of minority religious beliefs and no religious beliefs.  \n \nIn comparison to the paucity of research on the work-life interface across many strands of \ndiversity, there is a growing body of critical research that explores work-life issues for ethnic \nminorities. This research reveals the differences between the experiences of ethnic minority and \nmajority groups. For instance, the Black and Asian women interviewed by Bradley, Healy and \nMukherjee (2005) reported suffering the multiple effects of racism and sexism, work pressures \nwhich may contribute to conflict between work and nonwork in a way unknowable by the White \nmajority. Two important areas in which differences exist are in access and utilization of flexible \n 19 \nscheduling and in gender-role enactment of family responsibilities. Flexible scheduling is one \nway in which families attempt to address problems with work-family balance and negative job \nconsequences (e.g., tardiness, absence, and turnover) are reduced for those with access to it \n(Glover and Crooker 1995; Narayanan and Nath 1982; Pierce and Newstrom 1983). Access to \nflexible scheduling, however, is unequally distributed. In the US, for example, Whites have more \nof such options than non-Whites (Swanberg Pitt-Catsouphes and Drescher-Burke 2005; USDL \n2002).   \n \nNonwork-related responsibilities also differ along racial\/ethnic lines. In the United Kingdom, \nAfrican-Caribbean women are more likely than other women to bring up children alone. Among \nwidowed, divorced, or separated women, Pakistani\/Bangladeshi and Indian women are more \nlikely to have dependent children than either White or Caribbean women (Modood et al. 1997). \nAsian households are more likely to be multigenerational, with grandparents providing childcare \nassistance, but the household responsibilities of Asian women are therefore extended to include \nprovision of care for parents-in-law (Dale 2005). In the workplace, there is often a high demand \nfor extended leave from members of \u2018migratory families\u2019 among Asian, Caribbean and African \ncommunities, where children may be moved between countries and relatives for purposes of \nschooling and\/or caring (Bradley et al. 2005). By attending to the diversity of family structures \nalong ethnic lines (i.e. single parent households, extended families), the critical scholarship in the \nfield addresses one of the blind spots of positivist work-life research which takes the traditional \nnuclear family as the norm. \n \n 20 \nAside from family responsibilities, Black women in the UK often have additional and strong \ncommitments to civil society and community; many minority women are also involved in church \nor religious group activities (Bradley et al. 2005). Research in the United States has also \nhighlighted the significant role played by ethnic minority women in volunteer and community \nassociations (Chow, Wilkinson and Zinn 1996; Newman 2000). These findings bring us to our \nconcern about the overwhelming focus on the domestic sphere in critical work-life research. \nSimilar to their positivist counterparts, critical researchers too tend to approximate \u2018life\u2019 with \ndomestic life, despite the fact that the non-work related commitments of an increasing number of \nindividuals extend beyond family-related demands. As Eikhof, Warhurst and Haunschild (2007) \nargue, \u201clife is too readily equated with care responsibilities, and more precisely, with female care \nresponsibilities\u201d (p. 331). There are important reasons for this pattern. For example, Crompton \n(2002) identifies that the main tension in terms of gender and work is the one between economic \n(work) and social organization (family) of life. Similarly, Connell (1987: p. 121) explains that \nfamilies embody structures of labor, power, and sexuality which render them important for \nanalyses, as \u2018in no other institution are relationships so extended in time, so intensive in contact, \nso dense in their interweaving of economics, emotion, power and resistance\u2019. However, life is a \nmultidimensional course, which involves an individual\u2019s experiences from birth to death, across \nall ages and domains of education, work, leisure and domestic life. This is an issue \nacknowledged by researchers, who deliberately use terms such as \u2018personal life\u2019 rather than \n\u2018family\u2019 when studying the work-life interface, and who broaden the conceptualization of \npersonal life to include friendship and community engagement (e.g., Lewis, Rapoport and \nGambles 2003).  \n \n 21 \nOverlooking the experiences of individuals with nontraditional non-work commitments can \nresult in social exclusion for those individuals, and ignorance on the part of work organizations \nwith regard to the needs and motivational drivers of a growing segment of their workforce. \nRecent research by Innstrand, Langballe, Espnes, Aasland and Falkum (2010) surveyed \nindividuals living in four different household structures in Norway, and found that the beneficial \neffects of increased job autonomy on work-home conflict exist for single, childless workers and \nchildless couples as well as for single parents and those living in two-parent families. Offering a \nlimited band of work-life programs that are of little use to single employees without dependent \nchildren (e.g. parental leave, childcare facilities) may produce perceptions of injustice among \nthese individuals (Grandey 2001; Haar and Spell 2003; Kirby and Krone 2002; Parker and Allen \n2001; Smithson and Stokoe 2005; Young 1999), with concomitant negative outcomes such as \ncounter-productive work behavior (Skarlicki and Folger 1997). Recognizing this imbalance in \nthe work-life literature, Casper, Weltman and Kwesiga (2007) developed a scale to assess five \ndimensions of organizational cultures supportive of single, childless employees: social inclusion, \nequal work opportunities, equal access to benefits, equal respect for non-work life, and equal \nwork expectations. Their research revealed that employees with traditional family structures \nperceived greater equity in these dimensions than did employees who were single and did not \nhave children, and that perceptions of inequity were associated with reduced commitment to the \norganization and increased intentions to leave the organization. Informed by critical social \nscience and based on the blind spots of the current work-life literature in both critical and \npositivist forms, the next section introduces our suggestions for re-framing the nexus of work \nand life through an intersectional approach. \n \n 22 \nINTERSECTIONAL APPROACH FOR RE-FRAMING WORK-LIFE RESEARCH \n \nAttempts at deconstructing life in the context of the work-life interface are far from novel (Runte \nand Mills 2004). However, papers that offer new ways to frame and conceptualize the \nintersection of work and life are uncommon in the extant literature. In line with the spirit of \ncritical social science, with its ambitions to transform relations of power to make them more \ninclusive and egalitarian, in this section we propose an intersectional approach to overcome the \ntendencies outlined in the previous sections and offer more inclusive frames for the future of \nwork-life research. \n \nDespite the fact that intersectional analysis is now widely used in fields of social science (e.g. \n(Belkhir and Ball 1993; Duffy 2004; Harvey 2005; hooks 1984; Hull, Scott and Smith 1982; \nKnapp 2005; Smith and Stewart 1983; Steinbugler, Press, and Dias 2006; Weber 2001), the \nwork-life literature has remained relatively unaffected by these developments. Acker (2006, \np.443) defines intersectionality as the \u201cmutual reproduction of class, gender and racial relations \nof inequality\u201d. Similarly, Mahalingam (2007) argues that intersectionality refers to the interplay \nbetween the person and social location that is situated in relation to other locations in a web of \npower matrix.  As apparent in these definitions, the main strength of intersectional analysis is the \nrecognition that diversity and power are embedded and intertwined in any social phenomena. For \nthat reason, we argue that intersectional approach is well situated to respond to the blind spots in \nwork-life research and to open up a robust and meaningful way forward for the future research in \nthe field.  \n 23 \n \nAccording to the intersectional approach that we recommend, it is essential to rethink the \ntreatment of life, diversity and power in order to reconceptualize the work-life interface, and the \ncategory of \u2018worker\u2019. In this section, we explain what this means in terms of operationalization \nof concepts and constructs, strategies of sampling, and interpretation and analysis of empirical \nevidence. Table 3 represents a summary of the treatment of life, diversity and power through the \nlenses of an intersectional approach across these three stages of work-life research. \n------------------------------ \nInsert Table 3 about here \n------------------------------ \nConceptualizing Life \nTo start with, we argue that \u2018life\u2019 in its totality needs to be brought back in work-life research. \nThere is a growing realization that effective management of the work-life interface promises \npositive organizational outcomes (e.g. Pratt and Rosa 2003). However, for effective management \nto take place, we need an accurate conceptualization of what we mean by \u2018life\u2019. Our critical \nreview demonstrates that while there is a growing minority of researchers who incorporate \naspects of life beyond spouses and childcare in their assessment of the work-life interface, the \ncontemporary framing of \u2018life\u2019 is, for the most part, limited. We recommend that the \nexpansionary approach to \u2018life\u2019 taken by this growing minority should be mainstreamed into all \nwork-life research. We suggest that adopting an intersectional approach would help researchers \nintroduce a more inclusive conception of domestic life. Considering that the nuclear family is no \nlonger the norm for most societies (e.g. Oppenheimer 1994), some recent formulations of the \nwork-life interface discount the life experiences and demands of individuals who remain outside \n 24 \nthe frames of traditional family. Furthermore, approximation of \u2018life\u2019 to domestic life in both the \ncritical and positivist traditions leads to silencing the work-life issues in non-domestic domains \nof life.   \n \nThus in operationalizing \u2018life\u2019, work-life research needs to attend to all significant aspects of life, \nincluding education, unpaid domestic and care work, as well as leisure. As Ransome (2007) \nsuggests, by including recreational activities in addition to assessing paid work and unpaid \ndomestic labour in any analysis of an individual\u2019s total responsibility burden, work-life research \ncan be more fully applied to a range of household types, rather than those composed of \nheterosexual couples with young children. Rather than narrowly focusing on the tensions \nbetween domestic and economic life, the work-life literature can consider a wider range of \ndemands placed on an individual\u2019s temporal, spatial, and relational commitments in the domestic \nand non-domestic spheres. Opening up definitions of family responsibilities and couples to \ninclude a wider range of existing household configurations and non-work commitments would \nhelp to account for individuals\u2019 work-life experiences more accurately and more inclusively. \nThis requires developing measures to account for non-traditional household forms as well as \nnon-domestic components of life.  \n \nFurthermore, efforts to reframe the work-life interface should consider the fluctuating nature of \nthe boundaries in defining \u2018work\u2019 and \u2018life\u2019. As a direct consequence of technological, economic \nand social transformations in post-industrial, advanced economies, these boundaries have \nbecome temporally and spatially blurred (Fincham 2008, Lewis 2008, Orlikowski 2007). For \ninstance, many organizations pursuing a high-commitment culture take steps to actively blur the \n 25 \nboundaries between employees\u2019 work and private lives in order to extend organizational control \n(Fleming and Spicer 2004). This can be done by scheduling work activities outside of traditional \nwork hours, and holding them in locations other than the workplace (e.g., team meetings in a \nrestaurant). Employees may be encouraged to perform work activities in the home, again \nblurring both temporal and spatial boundaries. Lewis (2003) discusses the extent to which post-\nindustrial knowledge work has become a type of leisure, in that employees freely choose to \nengage in work activities outside of work, and derive enjoyment from doing so. She identifies a \nnumber of constraints on this notion of personal choice, including the intensification of work, \nsocietal values that equate self-worth with hard work and career success, and organizational \ncultures that equate commitment and productivity with long work hours. These shifting \nboundaries between work and life have implications for the degree to which individuals perceive \ninterference between the two spheres. Fangel and Aal\u00f8kke\u2019s (2008) study of Danish \nprofessionals revealed that knowledge workers fail to perceive many of their work activities \u2013 \nsuch as dealing with e-mails, conducting informal meetings with colleagues, etc. \u2013 as \u2018real\u2019 \nwork. Instead, they see these activities as social endeavors that infringe on their \u2018real\u2019 work, \nwhich is conceptualized as tasks undertaken independently and resulting in tangible outcomes \nsuch as reports written or projects completed. Reframing these communication-based work \nactivities as \u2018non-work\u2019 pursuits creates a more permeable work-life boundary, and results in \ngreater experienced life-to-work interference. Taking the dynamic nature of boundaries between \nwork and life into account is necessary should researchers wish to better capture the complex \nprocesses attendant on the work-life interface. \n \n 26 \nSensitivity also needs to be present when samples are drawn. Groups that are excluded from the \nmajority of both positivist and critical studies (e.g., single people without dependent children;  \npeople in non-typical relationships) are no longer a small minority or atypical in contemporary \nlabor markets. Their omission from work-life studies therefore leads to skewed and unrealistic \nsnapshots of social reality. For that reason, we advise researchers of the work-life interface to \nmove away from the common practice of discarding segments of their sample sets that do not \nconform to the criteria of being in a heterosexual partnership and\/or having dependent children \nliving in the household (e.g. Baltes and Heydens-Gahir 2003; Carlson and Kacmar 2000; Carlson \nand Perrewe 1999). We suggest the sampling strategy to be devised in a way to represent \ndifferent experiences of work and life.  \n \nIn addition to the stages of operationalization and sampling, another process in which diverse \nexperiences of the work-life interface are left under-theorized is the interpretation and analysis of \nthe evidence. There is undoubtedly much knowledge lost when surveys completed by workers \nfrom nontraditional households or with unconventional personal responsibilities are discounted \nand their results not analyzed or published, or when data derived from these nontraditional \nrespondents are amalgamated with those of \u2018traditional\u2019 respondents, and differences between \nthe two are not investigated or identified. Our intersectional approach argues for recognizing \nsocial, economic and cultural context in order to capture \u2018life\u2019 in a way that is closer to its nature, \nas a multifaceted concept. In order to have such a realistic conception of \u2018life\u2019, which transcends \nthe narrow frames in the literature, there is a need to account for the relational interdependence \nof different aspects of life in the analysis and interpretation of data. As patterns of social life are \ntemporally and spatially specific, the context dependency of the organization of \u2018life\u2019 needs to be \n 27 \ncaptured by work-life studies. This means that contemporary developments and evolution of \nsocial life must be reconciled in the methodological and conceptual framing of work-life issues. \nDemographic changes in terms of forms, structures, patterns of domestic life, family, and leisure \nshould be considered in designing work-life studies. This may require a dialogue between work-\nlife studies and broader economic and social scholarship which examines contemporary patterns \nof life. \n \nAddressing Diversity \nThe second question we posed when we reviewed the literature was, \u201cHow is diversity \naddressed?\u201d Our review suggests that management of the work-life interface is implicitly \nrendered a women\u2019s issue. This prevents the work-life literature from gaining recognition and \nsupport from men. Chapman (2004), in his exploration of gender relations in domestic life, \nreveals that women and men\u2019s attitudes to domestic life have been transforming to an extent. He \nexplains that economic and social changes, as well as daily practices of negotiation in the \ndomestic sphere allowed new forms of resistance to conventions of defining work and family in \nnarrow ways, altering gender relations in the domestic sphere (Chapman 2004). Nevertheless, \nthese changes are not substantial enough to suggest absolute equality for women and men in \ndomains of work and domestic life. Therefore, feminist reading of the work-life interface is \nessential to capture gendered inequities in the organization of \u2018life\u2019, and gender remains a salient \ncategory in understanding work-life issues. Here, again, the approach taken by those few \nresearchers investigating the work-life experiences of men should be brought into the \nmainstream of work-life research, rather than remaining at the margins.  \n \n 28 \nHowever, there are other strands of diversity with important implications for experiences of the \nwork-life interface (e.g. Bradley et al. 2005; Schmitt, Fuchs and Kirch 2008). As Acker (2006: \n422) puts it, \u201cgender is fundamentally complicated by class, race\/ethnicity, and\/or other \ndifferences\u201d. Although there are studies which examine categories other than gender, \nintersectional analyses have been widely lacking in work-life research. This is due to the added \ncomplexity that intersectional analyses may bring to a field which is characterized by abundance \nof mediating factors. However, as several feminist and critical race scholars who explored \ndiscrimination have suggested, a single category focus oversimplifies the complex nature of \ninequality, and excludes the experiences of the least privileged (Brah and Phonix 2004; Cole \n2009; Crenshaw 1991; Silverstein 2006). Reflecting on the use and narratives of paid maternity \nleave, Albiston (2005) argues that focusing on a single strand of inequality (i.e. gender) may lead \nto focusing on the experiences of White middle class women, rendering the policy and practice \nof paid maternity leave problematic for men and women from non-White and non-middle class \nbackgrounds. For that reason our intersectional approach calls for introducing multiple of strands \nof diversity in framing work-life concepts and methods. \n \nThis requires researchers to develop measures that capture the relations between diverse \ndemographic groups as well as attending to the unique circumstances within which each group \nfind itself. For that reason, sampling strategies need to respond to the demographic diversity of \nthe workforce. Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen tells us that not all forms of diversity can be \nincluded in analyses of equality and inequality. He suggests that parsimony should be applied to \nthe categories of diversity to be included, if meaningful conclusions are to be drawn. Sen (1992) \nrecommends that groups and classes which are marked with significant differences and divisions \n 29 \nshould be identified and studied. Similarly, our intersectional approach does not suggest that \nresearch should include all possible forms of diversity as this would be an impossible endeavor \nfor many research projects.  We recommend an application of critical judgment in selecting the \ncategories for inclusion in accordance with their salience in the social, sectoral and \norganizational context of a particular study.  We suggest that samples should represent the major \nmarkers of difference in experiences of the work-life interface across diverse forms of family, \nlife courses and demographic groups. \n \nAt the stage of interpretation and analysis of data, our approach argues against an additive \napproach in accounting for the influence of multiple strands of diversity. As suggested by several \nintersectionality scholars, the effect of membership in multiple demographic groups is not \nexperienced in a cumulative manner that is measurable by adding the separate effects of each \ncategory (Anderson 1996; Hancock 2007; King1988; Levin et al. 2002; McCall 2005; Stewart \nand McDermott 2004; West and Fenstermaker 1995). That is, the effect of multiple categories in \nproducing work-life outcomes is not additive but interactive, producing qualitatively different \noutcomes than simple addition of the effects of different categories combined. For that reason, at \nthe stage of interpretation and analysis of the empirical evidence it is essential to examine the \nintersecting inequalities in the context of multiple strands of diversity as experienced by \nindividuals in their management of the work-life interface. In other words, analysis of data \ngenerated from diverse respondents need to focus on the interplay between different categories in \nproducing unequal work-life outcomes and experiences. This means that analysis and \ninterpretation needs to be sensitive to the complexity of the interdependence and contextuality of \nthe relation between different social categories. As the salience of diversity categories in terms of \n 30 \ninfluencing the work-life interface experiences vary contextually, the analysis needs to avoid \nuniversalizing the findings beyond the context and groups that are studied.  \n \nProblematizing Power \nWe argue that conceptualization and methodological designs which ignore interaction between \nmultiple strands of difference totalize social experience, failing to capture and problematize \nimportant power inequities. Conducting research on diversity, equality, and inclusion at work \nand life in cosmopolitan regions of the world, which are characterized by heterogeneity of life \ncourses and life choices, with no attention to such multiple strands of diversity is likely to allow \nfor many forms of social suffering to remain voiceless.  Furthermore, as leading intersectionality \ntheorist Collins (1990, p.225) argues, diversity categories such as gender, class and race are \n\u2018interlocking systems of oppression\u201d. For that reason, our intersectional approach calls for the \nintegration of power imbalances into the operationalisation, sampling and analysis in work life \nresearch.  \n \nAt the stage of operationalization, sensitivity to inequities of power means that key constructs \nneed to account for power and resource differentials between groups and for non-traditional \nhouseholds. We maintain that work-life needs and outcomes across categories of diversity cannot \nbe captured if they are operationalized as constructs that rest solely at the level of the individual. \nInstead, work-life interface should be framed across individual, institutional and historical levels. \nAs we have discussed, work-life constructs used by positivist work-life researchers are primarily \nindividual focused, which prevents this body of research from addressing to social and historical \ndynamics that construct power imbalances at the intersection of work and life. We propose that \n 31 \nwork-life research would benefit from adopting a perspective which Wacquant (2006) terms \n\u2018carnal sociology\u2019, a study of work and life which serves the purpose of understanding human \nexperiences as embodied and situated in power structures and relations.  \n \nAttention to power relations implies that sampling strategy should account for the inequality in \naccess to power and resources. The intersectional approach urges using strategies for sampling \nparticipants from wider segments of demographic diversity, with a view to investigate how \nmultiple strands of diversity intersect to create differentiated opportunities and constraints at \nparticular historical and contextual configurations. Simply studying male or female, disabled or \nable-bodied, or European or Asian workers is insufficient when factors such as educational \nand\/or economic privilege or disadvantage, unequal access to power and resources collude in \nshaping their experiences of the work-life interface. This means that the sampling strategy should \nbe based on group membership rather than individual level attributes, because work-life needs \nand outcomes vary in line with individuals\u2019 location across the structural and historical setting. \nFurthermore, diverse social groups are positioned in an asymmetrical power relationship that \nvaries across national, regional, sectoral and organizational contexts. For that reason, when \nsamples are drawn groups need to be chosen not according to fixed categories, but in terms of \ntheir access to power and resources in the specific context of the research undertaken.  \n \nAccording to the approach we put forward in this paper, analysis of power is an essential part of \nthe examination of work-life issues. Collins\u2019 (2000) exploration of the work-family nexus in the \nUS is an exceptional example of integration of power problematic into the analysis of the work-\nlife interface. She conceptualized the intersectionality of inequalities as contextual and historical \n 32 \nand situated the oppression and discrimination experienced by Black women in the context of \nsocial institutions and history. In doing so, she demonstrated how the treatment of the work-life \ninterface by the legal, cultural and political institutions in the US had created the unique \ndisadvantage experienced by Black women in the country. Similarly, we advocate that at the \nstage of analysis, work-life studies need to account for the intersectionality of social and \nhistorical factors in their relational complexity in order to reveal the dynamics of power, \ndisadvantage and privilege as they relate to the work-life interface. This requires the analysis to \nbe focused on employees\u2019 structural positions across multiple group membership, rather than on \ntheir personal attributes. The analysis is then to be tasked with demonstrating the historical and \nstructural power relations between groups and the resulting unequal work-life needs and \noutcomes in varying national, sectoral and organizational contexts. \n \nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n \nIn this paper, we demonstrate that contemporary theorization of the work-life interface is not yet \naligned with the heterogeneity of work-life experiences in labor markets. Our paper is based on \nthe premise that conceptualizing the work-life interface as more akin to the nature of reality on \nthe ground would improve the effectiveness of organizational change initiatives to improve \nwork-life policies and programmes. We identify a range of ontological and methodological blind \nspots in the work-life literature, and propose ways to open up the research to offer more inclusive \nconceptualizations of the work-life interface.  \n \n 33 \nRothbard, Phillips and Dumas (2005) identify the fit between organizational policy and \nindividual desire to segment work and life as having significant consequences for the job \nsatisfaction and motivation of workers. However, Saltzstein, Ting, and Saltzstein (2001) \ndemonstrate that the impact of work-life policies on workers\u2019 job satisfaction varies extensively \nby salient diversity categories. Therefore, understanding individual aspirations to balance work \nand life in the context of organizational structures and diversity demographics is important. Such \nan understanding may take different forms. Work-life research is located within the broad field \nof human resource management and suffers the same dichotomous attributes that characterize \nthis field. Barratt (2003) examines the human resource management field and reveals that the \n\u2018managerialist\u2019 and \u2018critical\u2019 positions are the two key, albeit polarized, standpoints from which \nmuch of the human resource management literature is written. In our paper, we conduct a critical \nreview of the research from both traditions examining the treatment of life, diversity and power, \nin order to document the blind spots and reveal implicit assumptions in both approaches.  \n \nFirst, our review demonstrates that contemporary framing of life in the work-life literature could \nbenefit from expansion in order to cover aspects of life beyond domestic life. The narrow and \ntraditional framing of 'life' in the majority of the work-life literature is not as innocent a choice as \nit may seem at first sight. Indeed, the narrow and traditional definition of 'life' and its \napproximation to nuclear family render material and emotional costs for a growing number \nof individuals who fall outside these frames. The intersectional approach we advocate calls for \nthe re-conceptualization of \u2018life\u2019 in a way to account for different aspects of life and the \nrelational interdependency of these different aspects. \n \n 34 \nSecond, other strands of diversity than gender also manifest as salient causes of difference in \nexperiences of the work-life interface. Inattention to single and multiple strands of social \ndiversity in work-life policy and practice at both organizational and national levels is responsible \nfor continued inequities of power. Our review also suggests that although there is a growing \nliterature on race and ethnic diversity, other strands of diversity such as disability, religion and \nbelief, sexuality are either ignored altogether or given very little research attention in the \nliterature. We explain further some significant omissions, silences, and exclusions in the \nconceptual and methodological framing of the work-life interface, which help keep the discipline \nfrom a critical engagement with \u2018unsavory\u2019 and taboo strands of inequality such as sexual \norientation, by containing the discussion around more \u2018respectable\u2019 and \u2018safer\u2019 issues of gender \nrelations. We dare to venture in this dangerous territory in this paper and suggest that work-life \nresearchers undertake a more inclusive study of the nexus of work and life by introducing greater \ndiversity at the stages of operationalization, sampling and analysis. An intersectional approach \nsuggests the necessity of not only introducing multiple categories of diversity into work-life \nresearch but also urges for a keen attention to the interactions among different categories and to \nthe ways in which they mutually construct each other. \n \nFinally, our review suggests that positivist work-life studies which focus on individuals as the \nlevel of analysis overlook important social and historical dynamics. Our discussion in this paper \nlends support for the appropriateness of work-life research which is sensitive to context, \nrelationships and history. Our intersectional approach suggests that analysis of relations and \nstructures of power should be key to the examination of the work-life interface at the level of \nsocial and organizational policies and individual experiences. Understanding the power \n 35 \nimbalances also requires embedding social class into the operationalization, sampling and \nanalysis stages of research.  \n \nIn summary, these three blind spots in the treatment of life, diversity and power need to be \naddressed if work-life studies are to become more relevant and accurately representative of a \nwider segment of the populations in contemporary societies. We believe that in order for the \nwork-life literature to provide a more authoritative vision for social and economic organization \nof work and life, we should seek to transcend the polarization of the field by bringing in \nconsiderations of power and diversity of experiences. The intersectional approach we suggest \nrequires reconceptualizing the work-life interface, and the category of \u2018worker\u2019. We urge work-\nlife researchers to reflexively ask three questions relevant to operationalization of concepts, \nsampling strategies and the interpretation and analysis of evidence. Whose experiences are \npresented with the conceptual and methodological constructs and theoretical frames of analysis? \nDo these reflect the experiences of excluded groups?  What are the implications of the constructs \nand frames that are used in terms of addressing the power imbalances inherent in work-life \nissues? Asking these questions is useful in encouraging researchers to make their assumptions \nexplicit. The intersectional approach is not prescriptive about what work-life research should \nfocus on in terms of diversity categories but calls for a new mind set to examine the contextual \nprocesses and relations that embed power imbalances, which draw the territory of work-life \nproblematic in today\u2019s society. \n \nIn terms of methodological approach, we do not suggest a new set of methods but sensitivity in \nthe processes of sampling, operationalization and analysis. In line with Perriton (2000), we argue \nthat the methodological and conceptual pluralism which currently characterizes critical \n 36 \nmanagement may provide an ideal model for studying the work-life interface. Such \nmethodological pluralism is more conducive to studies of deeper structures of power and \ndiversity when compared to purist methodologies of positivist or interpretivist tradition. \nTherefore, reflecting on it from critical perspectives, following Smith (2008) and Zald (2002) we \nadvocate retaining and fostering methodological and conceptual pluralism, relevance, and \nreconciliation. Thus, work-life research will benefit from the use of qualitative and quantitative \nmethods as well as historical analysis. However, the methods should be chosen on the basis of \ntheir potential for comparative analysis, which includes multiple groups and diverse experiences. \n \nAn intersectional approach has significant implications for policy interventions at the level of \nstate and organizations. The most straightforward policy implication is the necessity to widen the \nscope of work-life policies and provisions so as to respond to the needs of the individuals who \nare currently overlooked. This means that demographic diversity of the workforce, non-domestic \ndomains of life and forms of family other than nuclear family should be taken into account. \nDesigning separate policies for single categories to respond to workforce diversity may prove \nineffective because multiple group membership introduces a complexity and qualitatively \ndifferent work-life needs and outcomes that could be missed out in single category focused \npolicies. For that reason, policies need to be designed with an attention to the interaction between \ndifferent groups rather than assuming a cumulative approach. Similarly, power imbalances \nbetween groups need to be addressed. The policies should be sensitive to the regional, national, \norganizational and sectoral contexts, as work-life issues are fluid and vary contextually. The idea \nof a blanket approach that will apply across contextual divisions is misleading and carries the \n 37 \nrisk of further disadvantaging the employees who belong to the most vulnerable and most \nsubordinated groups. \n \nKossek, Lewis and Hammer (2010) speak of the necessity for organizations and societies to \nidentify and support the diversity of individuals\u2019 needs for managing the work-life interface, \nacknowledging that the myth of the \u2018ideal worker\u2019, on which organizational policies are \npredicated, persists. The \u2018ideal worker\u2019 conforms to a male style of working, by engaging in full-\ntime paid employment and being unencumbered by family demands or other commitments \noutside the workplace. In work-life research, we find study samples dominated by individuals \nwho have come to be seen by researchers as \u2018ideal work-life balancers\u2019: those who are \npredominantly female, White, middle-class and\/or engaged in white-collar work, involved in a \nheterosexual relationship, and the parent of young children. Just as organizational assumptions \nabout the \u2018ideal worker\u2019 continue to form the basis for the vast majority of working practices \nacross the developed world (Lewis and Cooper 2005), so do researcher assumptions about the \n\u2018ideal work-life balancer\u2019 inform the way in which work-life issues are framed and studied. This \nis significant because, as Fleetwood (2007) states, this type of selection and emphasis on the \n\u2018ideal\u2019 can render the discourse of work-life research and policy hegemonic and influence \npractice. Indeed, Mescher, Benschop and Doorewaard\u2019s (2010) study of ten multinational firms \nfound that corporate websites expressing support for employees\u2019 management of the work-life \ninterface reproduced traditional norms regarding the \u2018ideal worker\u2019, and reinforced the \nperception of flexible work arrangements as being used primarily by mothers of young children. \nTo formulate state and workplace policies that address a broader diversity of workers and their \nneeds, the myth of the \u2018ideal worker\u2019 must be overcome (Bailyn, 2006). We propose that a step \n 38 \nin this direction would be to overcome the reliance of researchers on study samples composed \npredominantly of the \u2018ideal work-life balancer\u2019, who is currently the focus of most work-life \nresearch. When the work-life literature reflects on the complexity of social reality by attending to \nits diversity and complexity, organizational policymakers may take notice and begin to pursue \nsystemic changes that may challenge the outdated assumptions upon which work-life policies \nand programs may be predicated.  \n 39 \nREFERENCES \n \nAcker, J.
