Assuming that \nsubjects share the constitutive cognems, the model proposes that mere focused attention on \nthe set of cognems in the field of common conscience may replicate the pattern of \nrepresentation from context into subjects, or, from subject to subject, through actualization by \nlanguage, where cognems are represented by verbal signs. Limits of the model are discussed, \nand evolutionist perspectives are presented with the support of field data. \n1 \n 1. Sharing objects \nA group can only be called such if, among other things, it shares a common \u00ab reality \u00bb, that is \na set of objects, material or other, upon which and with which its members interact. This \ntrivial precondition seems confirmed by any superficial observation of human groups, and has \nbeen recognized since the beginning of social science (e.g. Durkheim, 1912, 1991, p. 64) as a \nprerequisite to any form of human social life. For instance, communication, as any form of \nco-operation, is not possible without the basic sharing of some \u00ab context \u00bb or \u00ab content \u00bb \nbetween actors.  \nStill, as for many \"trivialities\", close investigation reveals that what seems at first obvious is \nnot so simple to describe. Centuries of philosophical and physical research still have not \nsolved the first part of the problem : what are \u00ab the material objects \u00bb of our common reality, \nwhat is the physical context we believe to share with other beings ? At best, research in \nPhysics or Epistemology, considering that we have direct access only to representations, have \nsent back the problem into the domain of the other fold of the question : \u00ab what are the \"other \nobjects\" -that is : representations- that we share? \u00bb. For instance, Zafiropoulo (1967, p. 5) \nconsiders that :  \n\u00ab Reality is at each age the set of concepts used to classify our perceptions (...) in other words, \nreality is a necessary but transient definition \u00bb. \nIn fact, it seems that the core of the problem is \"what is the nature of that something that \nobservers believe to share?\". And in this question every single word is a trap in itself. So we \nshall leave it open, in its complexity, for future generations. Our point here will be a more \nmodest approach, in a genetic perspective, of the term \u00ab share \u00bb: how do we come to share \ncommon objects, whatever their nature ?  \nWe shall first focus on how social representations propagate in a population. After giving a \nminimal definition of how a social representation can be described (section 1), we will \nillustrate how the sharing can be figured (section 2), then propose a basic model of \npropagation (section 3), with its limitations (section 4), and some empirical illustration \n(section 5). In so doing, the model will be extended, with a more detailed approach of how \nsocial representations are embedded in a global context, including \u00ab material \u00bb objects \n(section 6). We conclude (section 7) with the presentation of an evolutionist perspective, in \nwhich the propagation mechanism appears as a key feature of social representations. \n \n2. Representation as an association of cognems \nSocial psychology, exploring the question of \"community\" and \"meaning\", came up with the \nnotion of social representation (Moscovici, 1961, 1982, 1989). This productive concept is \nmore or less a scientific name for those \u00ab other \u00bb (non material) objects that are shared in a \ngroup. Those objects that we all believe to exist, but which are so complex and numerous that \nno discipline has yet been able to construct a complete taxonomy within a single theoretical \nframework. This is, in our view, derived from the nature of social representation : as it is a \n2 \nmeans to convert perception (in the large) into action, and vice-versa, it must be a flexible and \nversatile kind of tool, subject to many avatars. \n \nSocial representations have been widely explored, and were given numerous definitions \n(Moscovici, 1961, 1976 ; Jodelet 1984, 1989 ; Doise, 1985 ; Flament 1993 ; Harr\u00e9 1989...). \nThey vary slightly in scope and content, but agree on what Flament (1981)  calls a minimal \nstatement : \n -a representation is a set of cognems (\"cogn\u00e8me\", Codol, 1969), organized by multiple relations \n- those relations can be oriented (implication, causality, hierarchy...) but all can be \"derived\" \ninto a symmetrical relation expressing the vague idea of \"going together\" (....) \n- this relation, generally, is not transitive : if A goes with B for some reasons, and B goes with C \nfor other reasons, it may well be that A and C have no reason for going together\". \n \nThis approach, which founds the current empirical approach of social representations and the \ntheory of the core or \u00ab noyau central \u00bb (Abric  1984, 1994; Flament 1992 ; Guimelli & \nRouquette 1992 ; Guimelli (ed.) 1994) is mostly formal. It tells little about the functional \naspects of social representations, but gives a good basis for investigation. \nCurrent cognitive research, insisting on the multimodal aspect of cognition, suggests that \ncognems are of heterogeneous nature. Any object that may appear in the field of individual \nconscience seems a good candidate : perceptions, emotions, memories (which could be \nconsidered as \u00ab replays \u00bb of the former categories), motor or hormonal commands... May be \nalso \u00ab objects \u00bb not emergent to conscience may pretend to the status of cognems, but this is \nless clear. We like this definition because it is only a formal one, applying to the concept of \nrepresentation without taking options on functional aspects. It is compatible with our view \nthat representation should be considered as an object in itself, and not as a representation \u00ab of \nsomething \u00bb. And that is precisely why, as we shall see, it can propagate so easily. For us, \nrepresentation is what it represents (Lahlou, 1995) ; see also Wagner, in this issue, for a \nsimilar view. Let us stay with this ambiguity, and simply keep in mind that cognems include \nmore than verbal or iconic items, and that they may themselves be rather complex elements.  \nIn other words, \"a social representation is a structured set of cognitive elements\" (Rouquette, \n1994). It is upon this vague but consensual definition of social representation that we shall \nrely here, assuming that this formalism is fit for describing social representations. So, let us \nsay that there are \"cognitive elements\", or cognems, that a set of cognems that are associated \n(\"going together\") constitute a \"representation\". And that a \"social representation\" is a \nrepresentation that is \u00ab shared \u00bb by a group. \n3. What sharing means \nHaving something in common can be illustrated by a simple figure. Two subjects, Alter and \nEgo, each live in their \u00ab own world of perception \u00bb (Von Uexk\u00fcll, 1921), which respectively \ninclude their own perceived objects. Each object is an association of cognems. Some of these \nassociations are common to the Ego and Alter. This means that, for an external observer (let \nus call him \u00ab Thomas \u00bb) describing Alter\u2019s and Ego\u2019s worlds, there seems to be something \n3 \nidentical in each of those worlds. It can be represented (within Thomas\u2019 conventions) as \nfollows :  \nFig. 1 : Alter & Ego have Something in common \nego alter \nego's world  alter's world\nS S \n \n \nWhat they have in common is here symbolized as a set of cognems recognized by Thomas : \nsmall squares, circles, and an \u00ab S \u00bb in the figure. Let us suppose \u00ab S \u00bb is a special kind of \ncognem : a sign of a common language that Ego, Alter, and Thomas all know. To make things \nsimple, let us suppose that what (Thomas thinks) Ego and Alter have in common is the \nrepresentation of a chair. And S stands for the word \u00ab chair \u00bb. \n \nAnother way Thomas can represent the situation is : \nFig. 2 : Figuring the sharing of representation by the sharing of cognems \nego alter \nego's world  alter's world\nS \n \n \nIn doing so, he supposes that the representation of the chair is strictly identical in both Ego \nand Alter. So he may prefer to restrict prudently to considering that only the explicit, overt \nsigns that he can observe are common to Ego and Alter. \nFig. 3 : Figuring the sharing of representation by the sharing of signs \nego \nalter \nego's world  alter's world\nS \n \n \nIn doing so, he will only assume that there is at least some signs in common, and probably \nsomething else, which is more difficult to assess, because an external observer can never be \nquite sure of the limits of what is in common between Ego and Alter. \n \n4 \nThis last figure, close of Wagner\u2019s (1994) calls for some more comments. Cognems are \ndifficult to observe. To the external observers, only signs, that is perceptible stimuli, are \naccessible. It is probable, but not certain, that signs are the material cognems are made of, \nsince each individual constructs his own representation of his world from perception. Internal \nstates, considered from the point of view of the subject, undergo a very similar treatment to \n\"external\" perceptions. Or, better, all perceptions are at the final stage internal, and therefore, \nof the so called \"external\" objects, in the mind are only manipulated internal images or \nrepresentations, which Minsky (1985) calls \"simuli\".  \nAn ancient idealist position (Parmenides) states that \"One cannot know something that doesn't \nexist, nor state it ; since what can be thought and what can exist are the same thing\". But this \nis a very complex issue, so we do not wish to venture further at this stage. For the purpose of \nour model, let us only consider that, among cognems, there are some which can be elicited in \na public space, which we call signs. In figure 3, S, the common part of the representation, will \nat least be constituted by signs. Of what are not signs, we shall not speak, because they cannot \nbe talked about. Following Wittgenstein\u2019s (1921) final line of his Tractatus : what cannot be \nspoken about, must be kept silent. Only overt signs are accessible to observers. Cognems will \nbe used for our modeling purposes, but for empirical investigations, we shall keep to signs. \n \nLet us call U-language (Lahlou, 1990, 1995), the representational space of an individual. The \nU-language of an individual is a formal space that may contain all the possible combinations \nof his cognems. Roughly, it contains everything that this individual could possibly perceive \nwith his sensory and mental equipment. The U-language contains, among other things, what \nthe subject would call his world, that is what he believes to exist. But it contains more, \npossible perceptions, just as the natural language may contain sentences that have never yet \nbeen written or pronounced, but still would be a combination of existing words. We need this \nspace for formal purposes : there must be a place to inscribe the new representations.  \nWe shall consider that representations are common to a set of subjects (Ai) if : \n (condition a) their constitutive cognems (cj) exist in the U-language of each Ai \n (condition b) those (cj) are associated in the world of each Ai  \nTechnically, only signs are accessible to empirical research. So, for research purposes, we \nshall admit that representations are common to a set of subjects if : \n (condition a\u2019) their constitutive signs (sj) exist in the U-language of each Ai. This \ncondition can be assessed by checking, verbally or otherwise, if Ai recognizes each sj. \n (condition b\u2019) if those (cj) are associated in the world of each Ai. This condition can \nbe assessed by eliciting free association by Ai, e.g. with the methods presented by (Guimelli \n& Rouquette, 1992), (Moliner, 1994) or (Lahlou 1993). \n \nMany field works (Jodelet & Ohana, 1989) have evidenced that there are indeed numerous \nshared representations, in the restricted and empirically accessible sense we have just \ndescribed (conditions a\u2019 and b\u2019) : social representations are of that kind. This mental \nepidemiology, showing us social representations as endemic in a population brings the \nquestion of : how does this come ? Chance is no sufficient explanation for such a widespread \nand improbable distribution of complex objects. \n5 \n 4. Constructing representation \nWe believe representations diffuse in a population by two ways : spontaneous emergence, and \ncommunication, although research has until now mostly focused on the latter. Our basic \nmodel allows simple description of the processes of emergence and diffusion, which are \nsimilar anyway. \nIf condition a) is satisfied, that is, if the subject\u2019s U-language already contains the necessary \ncognems, then emergence of the representation simply comes by associating durably those \ncognems into a pattern of Ego\u2019s subjective world.  \nFig. 4 : Representation emerges from the association of cognems \nego \nego's world (before)\nS\n                           ego \nego's world (after)\nS \n \n \nWhat can create such association ? It seems that any focus of the subject\u2019s attention on the set \nof elements \u00ab as a pattern \u00bb will do the trick. Then, the subject\u2019s memory will fix into durable \nassociation the actualization of this set of cognems, that was once mere co-occurrence, or \nsuccession, in the field of focused conscience. This is a triviality. Let us describe how the \nprocess can propagate representation. \nFor example, suppose neither Ego nor Alter have ever heard about the concept of \u00ab finger-\nbowl \u00bb. Now Ego enters a French restaurant, orders sea-food, and plays with the objects on \nthe table, on which lies a finger-bowl. He tastes the lemon and water in the cup. The waiter, \npassing by, seeing Ego\u2019s strange behavior, tells him \u00ab This is a finger-bowl, sir. It is not for \ndrinking, but for rinsing your fingers after eating sea-food \u00bb. Thomas, sitting at a table nearby, \nobserves Ego, and assesses, as he sees Ego tasting the water, then listening to the waiter, that \nEgo has constructed the representation of a finger-bowl, connecting the sight, the feel, the \ntaste, the functional script, the meaning, the name... Thomas identifies this representation - \nthat he supposes Ego has just gained - with his own social representation of the finger-bowl. \nTo sum up, Ego, having already in his world the objects : water, bowl, lemon, finger, sea-\nfood, the experience of grubby hands, and some other relevant cognems (condition a), has \nassociated them (condition b) in a pattern that is the representation of \u00ab finger-bowl \u00bb. He \ncould do so because the situation he lived in the restaurant presented him the various \ncomponents (cognems) as a bundle. This representation has all the social and functional \naspects of a social representation : it belongs to a given culture, as can be stated by Thomas, \nor the waiter ; it links mental schemes to a certain reality, it is a means of achieving some \nconcrete goal, etc. As we shall see later (section 5) this is not accidental : this representation \nwas framed by a social context pre-existing before Ego\u2019s visit in the restaurant, and \ntransferred into Ego\u2019s mind. \n \n6 \nLet us now suppose that the next day Ego meets Alter and shares with him his new \nknowledge.  \nHe describes, using natural language, the situation, and the object : \u00ab I have discovered \nyesterday a new concept when I ate in a French restaurant. It is a bowl, with hot water and a \nslice of lemon in it, and you use it to rinse your grubby fingers after eating sea-food. It is \ncalled a finger-bowl \u00bb. As the bowl, the water etc. are not physically available in the \nimmediate common context of Ego and Alter, Ego uses words to actualize them in the \ncommon representational space, so that they constitute a set presented to Alter\u2019s attention. \nEgo does this so that Alter\u2019s memory \u00ab will fix into durable association the actualization of \nthis set of cognems, that only was once co-occurrence, or in succession, in the field of focused \nconscience \u00bb. In the end, we (or eavesdropping Thomas) can suppose Alter has now \ninternalized the representation of the finger-bowl. This can be easily assessed by investigating \nAlter for conditions a\u2019 and b\u2019, with protocols that are left to the imagination of the reader. \nSo the process is progressive: first, Ego actualizes the relevant cognems in Alter\u2019s \nrepresentational space. Then Alter\u2019s attention focuses on the pattern they make. Then Alter\u2019s \nmemory fixes the association between cognems. As we have stated, this is only possible if \nAlter previously has the relevant cognems (cj) available in his representational world \n(condition a), a premise that Ego will probably check if he is not sure that Alter has them. \nAnother condition is that Alter also has available the set (sj) of signs representing \nconventionally all the relevant cj, since the propagation from Ego to Alter will be done \nthrough the use of (sj). This checking (usually considered as unnecessary between subjects of \nthe same culture) is a preliminary phase. All this process can be figured as follows : \n \n7 \nFig. 5.1. : Preliminary : ensuring Alter has the right basic cognems  \nego \nalter \nego's world  alter's world\nFB F\nB\nZ  \nFig. 5.2. : Actualizing the cognems in a common representational space \nego \nalter \nego's world  alter's world\nFB \ncommon representational space  \nFig. 5.3 : Focusing attention on the pattern of the set of cognems, and naming them as a \nnew representation \nego \nalter \nego's world  alter's world\nFB \ncommon representational space  \nFig. 5.4 : Final state : the representation has propagated from Ego to Alter \nego alter \nego's world  alter's world\nFB \nFB\n \nTo summarize the two propagation processes, representation has propagated (from the context \nto Ego, or from Ego to Alter) by replicating, in a way that is a bit similar to viruses. Ego\u2019s \nrepresentation created a replica of its pattern within Alter by using Alter\u2019s own cognems, and \nhaving Alter\u2019s mental processes binding them in the right pattern. \nIt is worth noticing that, in propagating to Alter, the representation has not disappeared from \nEgo. Unlike matter, information does not obey to the law of mass conservation (Brunet, \n1990). It could even be said that on the contrary it probably reinforced in Ego : persuading or \n8 \nteaching someone is a well-known way of reinforcing belief and learning. This can be \naccounted for by the model : when actualizing the cognems in the common representational \nspace, Ego not only focuses Alter\u2019s memory on the representational pattern, but also his own, \nhereby strengthening his own associations between the cognems. \n \nOur model more or less generalizes and formalizes the process described by (Sperber, 1989) \nin his epidemiological approach of representations :  \n\u00ab Among mental representations, some -a very small proportion - are communicated, that is \nbring their user to produce public representation which in turn brings another individual to build \nup a mental representation which content is similar to the initial representation. Amongst the \ncommunicated representations, some -a very small proportion - are communicated repeatedly \nand eventually come to be distributed over the whole group, that is have a mental version within \neach group member. \u00bb \nSperber calls cultural representations those widely and durably distributed representations ; \nclearly, they could also be called social representations. \n \nBeing a handy simplification is the purpose of models, and this simple model easily claims to \naccount for the spreading of representations within large populations of humans. It also \npretends to account for the fact that those representations can be adapted to an external \ncontext, since -as we have seen in the first part with the example of the finger-bowl- any \nobject can propagate its own structure as a representation in the subject\u2019s internal world, \nthrough the mere process of perception and attention. Humans, and non-Human objects have \na symmetrical role in propagating representations ; the difference being is that Human-to-\nHuman communication tends to favor using a system of signs, when non-Humans-to-Human \ntends to use more perceptual cognems.  \nBut of course, our model is too simplified. No one would expect that a model using a couple \nof signs and figures could account for phenomena which we know use configurations of \nbillions of neurons. Let us examine some of its limits. \n \n5. Limits of the model \n5.1. Not all cognems are overt signs \nInternal representations have other components than signs, e.g. kinestesic, emotional... They \ncan hardly be abstracted from their sensory-motor context, as one can expect from their \nbehavioral function. The material on which the researcher should ideally investigate is what \nFlament (1989) calls \u201ca praxeo-discursive corpus, including the record of all practice and \ndiscourse of (the) population\u201d. In fact, research mostly focuses on verbal signs, and some \nother overt behavior accessible to observation. This is a strong limit to applying or falsifying \nthe model. All that can be checked is the transmission of the (sj), and, even with brain \nimagery, the observer, external by construction, will never have access to the cognems (cj) \nwhich remain theoretical objects. \n9 \nStill, as overt (sj) are precisely the elements used by Ego and Alter to propagate the \nrepresentation, this may not be so crucial a limitation. In fact, a properly falsifiable theory \nwould be one that defines social representations as only constituted of (sj). (And indeed a \ncloser epistemological look at our formalism would unveil that it is actually the case in our \nmodel, since (cj) is a set of objects in our descriptive formalism, therefore having the status of \nsigns.) \nStill, one should keep in mind that what is transmitted through signs is more than the signs \nthemselves. Participants already share a large amount of experience which is not observable \nduring the transaction, but nevertheless is active in the process. For example, when Ego says \n\u00ab water \u00bb and \u00ab lemon \u00bb he actualizes in Alter\u2019s conscience more than the words themselves, \na complex and vast network of multimodal memories of Alter\u2019s past experiences with waters \nand lemons. Then, what Alter will bind together as the representation of the finger-bowl will \nprobably be a complex multimodal set of cognems including those memories, and not only \nthe observable signs which Thomas heard Ego pronounce. Through communications of words \nor other observable signs, more can be transmitted than the perceptible (signs) part. It is like \nmanipulating a suitcase by the handle. One can pass it to someone else just by passing the \nhandle.  \n \n5.2. Not all mental representations are social representations  \nThe individual representations of a so-called same social representation vary slightly in \ncontent or pattern from subject to subject. And, as can be empirically assessed, some of those \ndifferences can be systematically linked to specificity of the subject (e.g. gender, age, social \nclass...). For instance, Lahlou (1992, 1995) showed that, although the social representation of \n\u00ab eating  well\u00bb is similar within the French population, some aspects of the representation are \nmore developed in some segments of the population. The nuclei of \u00ab desire \u00bb and \u00ab filling \nup \u00bb are more developed in the young, while the elderly develop health aspects with the \nnucleus of \u00ab not too much fat or sugar \u00bb, etc. This type of result, where the basic nuclei of the \nrepresentation are more or less developed and salient depending on the situation of the \nsubject, is common in representation studies (e. g. : Di Giacomo 1980, Guimelli 1994). \nThis raises the problem of the limit of the social representation, which is a fuzzy object.  \nWhorf (1927) introduced the terms connection to distinguish between the associations that \nare idiosyncratic to a subject, and connections which are systematic associations within a \npopulation. It seems that this distinction is a good way to recognize, empirically, what can be \nconsidered as \u00ab social representation \u00bb, and what cannot, but can only be considered as \nindividual mental representation. In this perspective, social representations are the common \npart of internal representations, as assessed by the observer. As stated earlier, the empirical \napproaches derived from the social representation core theory have come up with \ninvestigation methods that allow dealing with that problem. \n \n10 \n5.3. The complexity of the social representations \nOur model is too simple to account for the construction from scratch of the attested, complex, \nreal social representations, as observed in the wild. There is a technical impossibility of \nbuilding a formal model that could compute social representations in their richness. Human \nsocial representations are products and nurture for the human mind, and what is known of the \ncomplexity of brain physiology is enough to discourage any sort of full scale modeling of its \nprocess with the only tool of words written on paper.  \nAlbeit this limitation, the model can be useful if taken as an image of an incremental process \nof collective representation building. What it cannot account for at once, it can account for by \niteration. \nEven when staying within the narrow boundaries of the model, providing that they start with a \nlarge number of cognems (e.g. : their perceptions) Ego and Alter can progressively construct \ntogether a common world containing a large quantity of social representations, some of which \nmay be very complex. For the system works by accretion : any existing representation can be \nused just as another cognem, and be connected to others in order to construct a new \nrepresentation. This, in a virtually endless combinatory process since, as we have stated, \ncreating a new combination does not destroy the existing ones. In this respect, representation \npropagation is far superior to any material system, whose dissemination is limited by the law \nof mass conservation. And, indeed, cultures are very complex sets of representations, \nreplicated in very numerous individual representational worlds of the subjects which \nconstitute the cultural population.  \nThis progressive aspect can account for such an epidemiology of such complex patterns as are \nobserved in the wild. One should bear in mind that what we have described, with a simple \nmodel, takes places continuously during an individual\u2019s life, allowing him or her to construct \nrepresentations of millions of objects ; objects which are constantly confronted with the \nenvironment or other subjects\u2019 representations. Only this permanent modeling of the \nindividual representational world to the subject\u2019s environment ensures the persistence of a \ncontent of his inner world compatible with the outside worlds, including the worlds of the \nother humans. To give an order of magnitude : we have manipulated in our figures a dozen \nsigns, where a human brain contains more billion of neurons. If we represented the visual \nexperience of a twelve year old kid with a continuous 35 mm film at the usual cinema speed \nof 24 frames per second, the film would be about 800 000 km long, enough to go to the Moon \nand back. So, our 8 cm schema is a rather simplified model. But one can imagine that, \nrepeated and combined billions of times, the combination and binding of cognems may \neventually yield the complex representations that we can observe in the everyday life. \n5.4. Replication is only approximate \nAs stated earlier, Ego and Alter do not, probably, dispose of the exact same set of cognems. \nNor do they link exactly the same set of cognems (cj) with the same set of signs (sj). For, as \nCyrulnik (1989, p. 84) writes : \n\u00ab (...) a living being can perceive, through the lens of its internal world, only the data that his \nsensory and neurological equipment can process. Each objective world is therefore different \nfrom one individual being to another, since our sensory organs and our brains are different \u00bb  \n11 \nWhat is true from species to species is also true from a specific human to another, since their \nindividual histories (and hence memories) are different. This state of affairs implies that \nreplication of the representation will not be perfect from subject to subject. In other words, the \nrepresentation undergoes a small mutation when replicating. This mutation, which justifies \nconsidering social representations as populations of individual representations (Lahlou, \n1995), has interesting consequences in their adaptive capacities.  \nAs social representations are a means of surviving by producing efficient actions, adequate to \nthe environment (e.g. : not drinking from the finger-bowl, although some representations have \na more dramatically selective role!), the existence of a large number of variants facilitates the \nevolution of the global population or individual representations towards more efficiency. For \nhumans favor to host efficient representations, and spend a large amount of time \u00ab seeking for \ninformation \u00bb, that is, trying to select for their internal representational fauna the best \nrepresentatives available ; just like Darwin\u2019s pigeon breeders did with their birds. \n \n6. Social representations, context, and social constructionism \nAccepting the hypothesis that representations can replicate so easily, one would be tempted, \nadopting a completely idealistic view, to propose a social constructionist view of reality, \nuniquely based on representations. In this perspective, humans would collectively build a \ncommon Umwelt constituted only of social representations. This standpoint is appealing for it \nallows describing all objects, material or not, with the same formalism, and can be developed \nwith some coherence if applied to description of the world by a given observer (e.g. : \n\"Thomas\"). Which is, in fact, the general case, for description is always description by a \ngiven observer. Still, pragmatic approach suggests that it may be more practical to continue \ndistinguishing a \u00ab reality \u00bb, which can be defined as the set of objects common to a \npopulation, immaterial and material, even if further research may someday prove that the \nlatter are a subset of the former. \nWe shall here give a short example, more realistic than the model, of how representations \npropagate. This description will not only involve the social representations, but the context in \nwhich they occur. For no representation can be isolated from the global setting in which it is \nproduced and with which it interacts in the course of global social evolution. \n6.1. Language is not a transparent tool \nInvestigation on the social representation of \u00ab eating \u00bb in the French population, by statistical \nanalysis of lexical data (1) obtained by free association on the terms \u00ab manger \u00bb and \u00ab bien \nmanger \u00bb on several French samples ranging from 1600 to 2000 subjects (Lahlou, 1993, 1994, \n1995) showed that social representation of eating in France is made of 6 elements, or nuclei : \ndesire (libido), take, food, meal, filling up, living. These nuclei are easily understandable, \ntheir link to the physiological sequence (libido\/intake\/food\/filling up) oriented towards living, \nand the human way of socializing this intake in meals needs little comment.  \nThe basic structure of this representation can be accounted for by the first fold of our model, \nwhich states that representation can emerge spontaneously from association of cognems that \nactualize as a pattern in the field of attention. It seems here that the pattern could have been \n12 \nbuilt by repeated chaining of couples of states which usually occur in a sequence : \nlibido\/intake, intake\/food\/ intake\/filling up, intake\/meal, food\/meal. The link between living \nand the rest seems to be a mental reconstruction.  \nConsidering this pattern, we note that natural social representations, at the level at which we \nstudy them, seem to connect together objects (the nuclei) larger than elemental cognems. In \nfact, each of those cognems\/nuclei is a representation in itself. Each nucleus connects into a \nnetwork a large set of more or less similar elements, something like a paradigm. As an \nillustration, here are (translated from French) some of the numerous words that were clustered \nby our software as typical elements of the nucleus \u00ab food \u00bb : food, feed, bread, nourishment, \ndiet, sustenance, supply, milk, dietetic, element, meat, nutri (-tion, -ent), breast, sour, sweet, \ncake, soup, vegetable, product, water, berevage, fresh, animal, fruit, lean, egg.... \n \nWhether the connections that emerge from the verbal material were constructed \nindependently by each individual is doubtful. These connections exist in the culture, \nmaterialized by the very structure of the semantic network common to all speakers. This can \nbe proved by an analysis with the same method on a corpus of about 1,4 Megaoctets obtained \nby concatenating some 540 definitions of the term \u00ab to eat \u00bb and its synonyms or associates, \nand synonyms of its synonyms, as yielded by an analogical dictionary, Le Grand Robert \n(Lahlou, 1995). In this investigation, the dictionary is considered as a typical representative of \nculture, submitted to a free association protocol similar to the one applied to human subjects. \nWe obtained the same structure of the social representation, although richer and more fine-\ngrained than live Humans\u2019 because of the didactic style of the dictionary and its large \nvocabulary, which exceeds by far the lexicon of the layman.  \nThe fact that both sources (dictionary and subjects) yield similar patterns of social \nrepresentation, strengthens the social representation theory. But it also shows what a complex \nhen-and-egg problem the study of representation propagation has to face. For no human is \nborn in a desert, and the very communication tools he uses, to build up and to express his \nrepresentations, already contain implicitly some pattern. \nDetailed analysis of the structure yielded by the dictionary showed that some nuclei contained \nelements whose presence can only be explained by a long term hysteresis, tracing back \ncenturies, and in some cases probably much more. For example, remains of the Hippocratic \nphilosophy are still present in the associations observed (Lahlou, 1994). So, when \ninvestigating and \u00ab old \u00bb representation (unlike what Moscovici could do with \npsychoanalysis, for example) we must be aware that it may carry in its structure traces of a \nlong history that has been embedded in the language, and in the very elements the \nrepresentation is made of : nothing is ever fully new, and representations are made of \nrecycled, recombined, pre-existing representations.  \n \n6.2. Context is also what representations are made of \nOn this same topic of eating behavior, we tried to understand how circulation of information \nin the media would reflect or modify the representations. Therefore, we collected nearly 300 \narticles published in the press (daily newspapers, and newsmagazines) about the topic during \n13 \na period of three years, and submitted them to content analysis with the same statistical \nmethod described in the last section (Lahlou, 1996).  \nIt is interesting to note that the structure obtained is different from the one obtained on the \nhuman subjects and dictionary. Two of the seven \u00ab classes \u00bb (it would not be correct to speak \nof \u00ab nuclei \u00bb, since the data collection method, very different from free association, is not \ndesigned to obtain a representation pattern but rather a collection of topics) obtained are \nsimilar to the food and meal nuclei already described. The five others enlighten the stakes \nbehind the production of information and representation, and are instructive because they \nstress the game of actors that constitute the context. Two classes are about the \nmacroeconomic determinants of the food sector ; one presenting the evolution of industrial \noffer world-wide, the other the innovation of French firms. This traces the information flux by \nwhich actors and institutions try to inform, and influence, others ; by lobbying or trying to \nimpose their conceptual framework, e.g. on European market politics. \nThree other classes describe aspects of food consumption in the population. One, centered on \nthe nutritional aspects, contains a medical discourse, with repressive tones, insisting on risks \nand prescriptions (e.g. : do not eat cholesterol). Another, describing consumer behavior, \ndiffuses results of market studies and describes the tendencies of the French market. The \nlegitimating effect, as evidenced by the frequency of experts\u2019 quotations, is important in this \ndiscourse that contributes to creating a representation of what the French consumer wants, in \nthe minds of producers and retailers. The last class describes cultural aspects of the eating \nbehavior. It is interesting to note that, as detailed analysis shows, the primary sources of the \ninformation are very few. For example, the last class has been constructed mainly by \nquotations or interviews and comments of the work of a single researcher who had just \npublished a (successful) book on food sociology !  \n \nThe discourses circulating in a public space, of which those articles are a trace, contribute to \ninfluence the various populations which are their targets. Quantitative measurement of this \ninfluence is an impossible challenge, since it is difficult to separate their influence from other \nfactors But many clues tend to prove influence in the long run. For instance, the persistent \ncore of the dietetics discourse (eating varied and balanced) can now be found as a dominant \ntrait in the free associations of French subjects on \u00ab eating well \u00bb. This core replaces \nrepletion, which used to be the major trait of the representation, according to qualitative \nstudies conducted in the 1950\u2019s, and which now remains salient only among rural \npopulations. \nMore interesting than the potential influence of these discourses is the vast system of \nreciprocal influences they reveal, giving more flesh to a social constructionist model, and \nenlightening in a new way the notions of anchoring and objectivation introduced by \nMoscovici in his seminal work. \n \n6.3. The co-construction of material reality and representations \nA human society needs, as we have stated in the beginning of this article, a common reality. \nFrom the standpoint of the individual, sharing this set of representations is necessary to \n14 \nsurvive in a complex environment. In this respect, representations are an encyclopedia of the \nworld, that can be activated into action scripts, a kind of \u00ab user\u2019s manual \u00bb of the social \nreality, that every participant must know. So each actor knows how to play his part \n(Goffmann, 1973). But, from an aerial view, this set of representations also appears as a \nmaster plan for labor division, enabling social co-operation on a large scale : each individual, \nhaving his own version of the master plan, can play his own part.  \nWhat the (too short) evocation of the various pieces of information that actors exchange \nthrough communication media teaches us is that there is a continuous effort of global and \ndecentralized negotiation, by which actors (individuals, firms, institutions etc..) try to know \nwhat others do and want, on one hand, and try to influence the others by getting them to share \ntheir views. In this continuous process, each actor brings into the common field of public \nrepresentation the product of his activity : new combinations of representations (e.g. : medical \nor sociological knowledge on eating behavior), or new artifacts (e.g. : food products). All \nthose objects, material or immaterial, are symbolically processed in a common U-language (of \nwhich the media articles studied are only a part : buying acts, for example, are another, which \nappears through market statistics). In the great hen-and-egg process that follows, each actor \nmodifies his representations and activities. For example, consumers will look for low-fat \nproducts, and firms will design, produce, and retail such foods, which in turn will modify the \nforaging environment of the consumer, modify his practice and anchor them in reality. So, \nreality is indeed collectively co-constructed, and representations are a medium in this co-\nconstruction since they contribute to design action in the material. Anchoring, objectivation, \ncan then be seen as different ways of describing a single feed-back mechanism : \nrepresentations are constructed by anchoring in reality, and reality is constructed by turning \nrepresentations into artifacts (the reason why firms will design low-fat foods is because their \nmarketing services have a representation of the consumer as someone who will buy low-fat \nfoods).  \nReality contains patterns of elements that representations are made of (e.g. : \u00ab food \u00bb). It is so \nbecause, as we saw, reality propagates its own structures into the structures of social \nrepresentation. On the other hand, representations contain patterns of elements of which \nreality is made of, because, as we just suggested, through the behavior of actors representation \ngets materialized into artifacts (e.g. : food products). It seems that reality and social \nrepresentations contain the same patterns, more or less. In this \u00ab more or less \u00bb, constituted of \nthe difference between individual representation and social representation, and of the \nmutations and translation errors that occur in the process of pattern propagation, probably lies \nthe key of a dialectic evolutionary process. In this process, the same objects successively play \nthe role of pattern in a context, or part of the context.  \n7. An evolutionist perspective \nThe finality, if there is any, of the representation system, and of our socially constructed \nreality, is to provide that society can continue existing, collectively and as a set of individuals. \nIn this respect, representations are a means to propagate the patterns of reality (the common \ncontext) so that every part of this complex system can adapt to the context. The immaterial \nnature of representations facilitates this dissemination at low costs and fast speed. It allows \n15 \nadaptation to be done in the field of U-languages, by \u00ab thought experiments \u00bb. E.g. to test \nwhat concept of food I, as a manufacturer, should design, it is less costly to compare the \nrepresentation of the food to the representation of the consumer. Representations allow \nplanning action. They also allow capitalizing experience of others. By all these features, \nrepresentations allow a faster and more economical evolution and co-ordination of the global \nsociety. What social representations bring is a collective negotiation and cross-validation. The \ncross-validation ensures that the mental representations that individuals manipulate are indeed \nrepresentative of the global context in which action will take place. Conformity of individual \nrepresentation to the social representation tends to guarantee its ecological validity as a good \nrepresentative of \u00ab reality \u00bb -the collective context. \nAs we suggested, this adaptation of the social representation to the context comes from its \nnature as a \u00ab species \u00bb constituted of a population of individual representations hosted by the \nhuman population. By constant mutation at the individual level, and fast propagation of the \nadapted mutants, this population of representations is more likely, at every moment, to be \nmostly constituted of representatives that have a good fitness, that is are efficient models of \nwhat they stand for. For example, a fit representation of \u00ab a good food product \u00bb will be a \nmodel of what consumers, producers, medical institutions etc. want for their own purposes \n(satisfaction, profitability, health, etc.). This fitness is a result of the global negotiation \nbetween actors like the one we have evoked taking place through the market and the media. It \nis a global fitness for the whole society, since it is a compromise between all actors.  \n \nTo conclude, we propose to consider social representations as domestic species, and as an \nevolutionary tool at the scale of human societies. This tool is twofold : at the individual level, \nit enables the actor to survive in his environment. At the collective level, it enables co-\noperation and labor division. We suggest that the replication process by which representations \npropagate is a crucial key to the co-construction of a coherent, and collectively negotiated, \nsocial reality. \n \nNotes  \n(1) The method aims at spotting the basic nuclei of social representation, in the discourse \nproduced by an informed source. First, a corpus of statements (sentences in natural language), \nabout the same object (here : \"eating\") is obtained through the free association technique. The \nsentences obtained are aggregated into a single corpus. The corpus is processed with a \nstatistical analysis of lexical data software, ALCESTE (Reinert, 1987, 1993), that yields \nclasses of statements that have similar lexical content.  \nThose semantic classes are considered to be the basic nuclei of the social representation. This \nmethod is a kind of quantified, detailed, content analysis. Technically, classes are built on the \nprinciple of putting together statements that are close to each other within a cluster (analogy) \nand different from statements in other clusters (contrast). Analogy and contrast are made on \nthe bases of significant traits. In our case, the traits will be lexical (lemmatized or \nstemmatized words), and the mathematical technique used is descending classification \n(\"segmentation\").  \n16 \nBibliography \nABRIC, J.C.
