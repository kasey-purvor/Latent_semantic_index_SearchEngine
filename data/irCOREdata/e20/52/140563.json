Introduction \nIn recent years, low power consumption electronic devices have become pervasive. Electronic \ngadgets, including mobile phones, music players and navigation assistants, are at the centre of a very \nlarge consumer market; medical health monitoring devices improve the quality of life of many \npatients by offering them greater freedom of movement. Electronic miniaturization has brought about \nsmaller and lighter devices that are more portable. However, it is generally felt, both within the \nelectronic industry professionals and the consumers, that we are still enslaved by the need to \nconstantly recharge batteries and therefore that the most desired feature in electronic devices is \nfreedom from batteries. \nThe research community, within both academia and industry, has been addressing these problems for \na decade now, with efforts focussed on the development of batteries with higher energy densities and \non the development of alternative sources of energy, such as micro-generators [1] and energy \nharvesting (EH) [2]. Since the beginning, interest has been concentrated on the scavenging of energy \nfrom environmental vibrations, particularly for applications in wireless sensor networks, as many \nsuch sensors are not easily accessible for battery replacement [2]. More recently, more research \nefforts have been directed towards human-based EH, aiming at powering general consumer devices. \nAn excellent example of energy harvesting from the mechanical dissipative work taking place during \nnormal gait was presented in [3]. The authors developed an electromagnetic device capable of \nproducing 4.8\u00b10.8 W in the generative-braking mode during human walking. The only apparent \nlimitations of the device are its mechanical complexity and the considerable mass of 790 g (1.6 kg \nincluding braces). Part of the mass and the mechanical complexity was due to the implementation of \n2\/16 \n \ngears which increase the rotational speed of the electromagnetic generator to increase its efficiency. \nIn this paper, we study a device inspired by similar principles but based on piezoelectric bimorphs \nwhich are plucked while the wearer is simply walking. \nHuman activities, with the exception of vocalization, occur at very low frequencies, up to a few \nhertz. As is well known, piezoelectric bimorphs operating for sensing or energy generation are most \neffective at much higher frequencies. Devices of acceptable dimensions and mass for human \nintegration and offering power outputs in the order of milliwatts have resonance frequencies of \nhundreds of hertz. This frequency mismatch between excitation and harvester makes it challenging to \nefficiently harvest energy from human motion with piezoelectric devices. The solution adopted in \nthis paper is the implementation of mechanical means to effect an up-conversion of the frequencies, \nso that the piezoelectric bimorph vibrates at high frequency \u2013 in fact, at  resonance \u2013 even if the \nexternal excitation occurs at a few hertz. This principle was initially presented by Umeda et al. [4] in \nthe form of a piezoelectric monomorph disc impacted by a steel ball falling from a known height; as \nthe ball bounced back off the disc, the latter vibrated at its resonance frequency, generating electrical \nenergy. A hand-held prototype harvester based on this principle was realized by Renaud et al. [5]: as \nthe harvester is rotated on a vertical plane or hand-shaken from side to side, a \u201cmissile\u201d alternatively \nstrikes one or the other of two piezoelectric elements placed at either end of the enclosure that \ncontains it. Each bimorph is cyclically deformed as the missile strikes it and bounces off. Between \nimpacts, the bimorph vibrates freely at resonance and generates energy (an output power up to \n600\u00b5W was produced with a vigorous \u201cscratching\u201d motion). A device based on a similar shock \nexcitation but with dimensions in the order of millimetres was designed and prototyped by Cavallier \net al. [6]. Rastegar et al. [7] introduced a different form of excitation for use on platforms which are \nslowly rocking side to side or vibrating at low frequencies. Whilst in Umeda's device energy is put in \nthe piezoelectric transducer by impact (like wires are struck by hammers in a piano), in Rastegar's \ndesign the piezoelectric devices are more slowly deformed and then released (like chords are plucked \nin a harpsichord). Several concept designs for energy-harvesters based on a mechanical or magnetic \nup-conversion strategy were presented later by Rastegar and Murray [8]. In all designs, the \nfundamental principle is the transfer of energy from a \u201cprimary system\u201d, directly coupled to a low \nfrequency input, to a \u201csecondary vibrating system\u201d with higher resonant frequency. Sari et al. [9] \nhave applied the principle of frequency up-conversion via plucking to the microscale and  prototyped \nan electromagnetic generator where the low-frequency vibration of a suspended magnet excites the \nhigh frequency vibration of a number of coil-carrying cantilevers placed around it.  The conversion \nof low frequency cyclic translations into higher frequency motion was implemented by Howells [10] \nwith the Heel Strike Generator, where a system composed of lead screw, gear train and cam produced \nthe controlled sinusoidal deformation of four PZT-5A elements. A fundamental difference between \nthis technique and the one we are implementing is that Howell's bimorphs move at a frequency \nbelow resonance as they are always guided by the cam. An interesting piezoelectric harvester not \nbased on seismic oscillation but rather on the direct deformation of cantilevers was presented in 2005 \nby Priya [11]. Here the piezoelectric bimorphs oscillate between stops which are mounted on a shaft \nset into motion by an air flow, as in a conventional windmill. The paper also reports some simple \nanalytical modelling for the device where a static deflection of the beam is assumed (which is an \nacceptable approximation as the bimorphs are deformed at frequencies much lower than their \nfundamental).  \nIn the present work, we propose the use of a plucking-based frequency up-conversion strategy for \nenergy harvesting on humans, with special focus on converting the low-frequency rotation of the \nknee joint into high-frequency vibration of a number of piezoelectric bimorphs. We analyse the \nmotion and power output of a piezoelectric cantilever when plucked by a mechanical plectrum \ntouching its tip: the cantilever is deflected with constant speed up to a given displacement, after \nwhich it is expected to be released by the loss of contact with the plectrum (their contact area is \nprogressively reduced as they bend). As the displacement constraint is removed, we observe the free \n3\/16 \n \nvibrations of the cantilever, occurring at its resonant frequency, while the electrical energy produced \nis dissipated by a resistor placed across the device. This two-step action (deflection and release) \nsimulates rather closely the envisaged operation of the piezoelectric harvester we are currently \ndesigning for human-based energy harvesting. We also model the device as it is harmonically excited \nby a force on its tip; this set of analyses is meant to bridge between the standard harmonic seismic \nexcitation and the plucking action of interest. It should be mentioned that most of the literature on \npiezoelectric energy harvesting is still devoted to vibrational energy scavenging. As a result, it is \npossible to find many models, both analytical [12] and based on finite elements [13], where the \ncantilevers, most typically with an added mass on the tip, are subject to seismic excitation, usually of \nharmonic character. Other forms of excitation are much more rarely considered [14]. To the best of \nthe authors' knowledge, the input of mechanical energy into a PEHD by sporadic mechanical \nplucking has never been modelled before. Yet, such analyses are necessary to identify the many \ndesign parameters of a mechanical up-conversion harvester, such as piezoelectric material, frequency \nof  plucking actions, dimensions of the piezoelectric bimorphs, number and spacing of the plectra \nthat deflect the bimorphs and so on. The development of such an instrument is the main objective of \nthis paper. \n 2. Frequency up-conversion by mechanical plucking \nAs discussed in the introduction, mechanical plucking is here proposed as a frequency up-conversion \nstrategy in EH to bridge between the low-frequency inputs from human activities and the high-\nfrequency requirements of piezoelectric devices. Mechanical plucking is constituted of a sequence of \nphases represented schematically in Figure 1. In the approach phase, the distance between bimorph \nand plectrum is reduced until contact is made. Immediately follows the loading phase, during which \nboth elastic elements are deflected, according to their mechanical compliance. As the deflection \nprogresses, the overlap between the two elements is reduced so that their contact area becomes \ngradually smaller. A limiting deflection is reached when the contact is lost and each element is free to \nreturn to its undeformed shape; this is the release point. From this instant on, the bimorph vibrates at \nits resonance frequency around its rest position as a cantilever beam. As the bimorph vibrates, the \nstored mechanical energy is converted by the direct piezoelectric effect into electrical energy and \ntransferred to the external circuit; part of the mechanical energy is dissipated through various forms \nof damping, like air damping, dielectric losses and material internal damping. The outcome of \nplucking is frequency up-conversion, as by one single slow movement of the plectrum a large \nnumber of vibrations are produced at high frequency.  \n \nFigure 1. Illustration of the plucking action: 1) approach; 2) loading step with deflection of bimorph \nand plectrum; 3) release step followed by vibration of the bimorph at its resonance frequency. The \nplot shows the evolution of the external force applied at the tip of the bimorph as the plucking action \nprogresses. \n4\/16 \n \nA knee-joint harvester that ensures the repetition of the plucking actions to achieve sustained power \nproduction is sketched in Figure 2. During normal gait, for example while walking, the knee \nalternatively bends and extends once per second, covering a rotation angle of approximately 70 \ndegrees. With reference to the figure, the outer ring, carrying the plectra, is fixed to the thigh, whilst \nthe internal hub, carrying the bimorphs, rotates with the knee as it is fixed to the shank. As the person \nwalks and the knee alternatively extends and bends, each of the multiple plectra on the outer ring \nplucks the bimorphs according to the sequence outlined in Figure 1. The energy harvester is therefore \ncapable of converting the slow motion of walking into high-frequency vibrations of several \npiezoelectric bimorphs. It is expected that the design has the potential to produce a sustained power \nof several milliwatts during walking. \n \n 3. Modelling approach and experimental methods \n 3.1. Finite Element Modelling \nFinite Element (FE) modelling was performed using the commercial package ANSYS 11.0 (ANSYS \nInc. Canonsburg, PA, USA). The analysis is based on SOLID5 piezoelectric elements, SOLID45 \nstructural elements and uses CIRCU94 elements for the resistor placed across the electrodes of the \nbimorph. The power output is calculated from the voltage difference between the two electrodes, i.e. \nthe voltage across the resistor. The boundary conditions include displacement constraints on the top \nand bottom surfaces in the clamped portion of the beam. The device modelled is a series bimorph \nwith an internal brass shim and two sheets of PZT on either side, covering the entire surface (see \ndetails of geometrical measurements and material properties in Table 1). The choice of bimorph \ngeometry was dictated by considerations of the acceptable dimensions of the overall harvester. \nThe model includes viscous damping with the damping matrix C given by: \nbrassbrassPZTPZT K\u03b2+K\u03b2=C  \nwhere: \n\u03b2PZT and \u03b2brass = stiffness matrix multiplier for PZT and brass \nKPZT and Kbrass = portion of structure stiffness matrix based on PZT and brass \nThe \u03b2 parameter was calculated from the tabulated mechanical quality factor Qm and the resonant \nfrequency of the device as \n \nFigure 2: Knee joint piezoelectric harvester. It is worn on the external side of the knee and fixed by \nbraces. Inside, a hub carries a number of bimorphs which are plucked by the ring-mounted plectra \nas the joint rotates during normal walking. \n5\/16 \n \nm\u03c9Q\n=\u03b2\n1\n \naccording to section 5.9.3 of the ANSYS 11 Structural Analysis Guide. Two types of analyses were \nperformed: harmonic and transient. During the harmonic analysis, a sinusoidally varying force of 10 \nmN was applied at the tip and its frequency was scanned in the neighbourhood of the first resonant \nfrequency of the structure. This analysis is similar to the conventional analyses in [13], where the \ncantilever, with a large mass applied on its tip, is seismically excited by the vibration of its base. In \nthe present case, the force, rather than being of \u201cinertial\u201d origin and distributed along the cantilever, \nis localized on the nodes at the tip. The power output during the harmonic analysis was calculated as \nroot-mean-square power using the amplitude voltage V0 detected across the resistor R: \nR\nV\n=Prms 2\n2\n0\n \nTable 1.

The first is a loading step, during which \nthe bimorph was deflected at constant speed to a predefined tip displacement. In the FE model, this \nwas achieved with a ramped load solution step where the nodes at the tip were constrained to the \ndesired deflection (only displacements in the direction of approach were so constrained, to permit \nbending without stretching). This approximates the effect of a plectrum which comes into contact \nwith the bimorph and, moving at constant speed, deflects it, as seen in Figure 1. The following step is \nthe release phase and was modelled in a second transient analysis, starting with a stepped removal of \nthe tip constraints of a statically deflected beam. The solution was obtained at a large number of sub-\nsteps so as to adequately resolve the response of the device for several milliseconds until the \n6\/16 \n \namplitude of vibration was quite small. \nIn transient analyses, the instantaneous power P(ti) at substep i was calculated from the voltage \nacross the resistor at the same substep: \n( ) ( )\nR\ntV\n=tP ii\n2\n 1 \nFrom this, the average power Pav produced up to the time tn can be calculated according to the \nfollowing expression: \n( ) ( ) ( )01\n0\n>nfor\u2206ttP\nt\n=tP ii\nn\n=in\nnav \u2211  2 \nwhere \u2206ti is the duration of each substep. The average power is of particular interest in the release \nphase, as it permits to optimize the interval between plucking actions and to predict the ensuing \nsustained power. \nFinally, the instantaneous power is also used to calculate the cumulative energy produced up to \nsubstep n : \n( ) ( ) ii\nn\n=i\nn \u2206ttP=tE \u2211\n0\n 3 \n Naturally, E(tn) will be a monotonic function of time.  \n 3.2. Experimental details \nHarmonic response measurements with seismic excitation were performed with the experimental \nequipment and methods already described in [15], with the notable difference of the addition of a \nLaser Doppler Vibrometer (Polytec CLV-2534) which was used to measure the velocity of vibrations. \nThe closest match to the bimorph specified in Table 1 available commercially was found in the \npiezoelectric bimorphs type T215-H4-303X produced by Piezo Systems Co.; their dimensions are \n31.8x12.7x0.38 mm3, they are made of PZT-5H and they are poled for series operation.  A 130 \u00b5m-\nthick metal shim is sandwiched between two layers of PZT, each of thickness 125 \u00b5m. For the \nharmonic response test, a sample was mounted within copper-clad mechanical fixtures doubling up \nas pick-off electrodes, leaving a free length of about 22.5 mm. Seismic excitation took place with an  \nacceleration of approximately 7.1 m\/s\u00b2. \nThe plucking excitation, illustrated in Figure 1, was produced by loading the bimorph against a \nplectrum by displacing it over a given distance; release occurred upon retraction of the plectrum, \nmounted on a linear translation stage (Figure 3). Velocity data were collected with the Polytec LDV. \nA custom made fixture permits the mounting of the bimorph under test within copper-clad plates \nleaving a free length of 26 mm. The plectrum was a 3x2 mm2 (lxw) rectangle cut out of a 125 \u00b5m-\nthick Kapton\u00ae polyimide film. \n \n7\/16 \n \nFigure 3. Layout and major connections of the experimental set-up used for plucking excitation. The \nconditioning circuit between bimorph and A\/D converter, offering switchable electrical loads, is not \nshown.  \nBoth in harmonic and plucking excitation tests, the output of the bimorph was connected to the same \ncircuit described in [15], which supports electrical loads in multiples of 25 k\u2126 up to 550 k\u2126; the \noutput from the circuit was sampled and transferred to a computer.  \n 4. Results and discussion \n 4.1. Simulated harmonic analyses \nThe harmonic analysis simulates the normal operating conditions of an environmental energy \nharvester. The power output curves for the piezoelectric bimorph with the parameters specified in \nTable 1 are reproduced in Figure 4 and correspond to maximum voltage amplitudes ranging from \n2.7 mV at 300 Hz with 2 \u2126 up to 24 V at 320 Hz with 1 M\u2126 electrical load. The largest power output \nis found with an electrical load of 10 k\u2126. As the electrical load increases, we observe a shift in the \nresonance frequency towards higher values; as is well known, this is due to the stiffening effect \nproduced by the direct piezoelectric effect when the voltage on the electrodes is permitted to build \nup, which does not happen with lower resistors. The curve corresponding to 20 k\u2126 is particularly \ninteresting as it has a maximum at frequencies intermediate between open and closed circuit and \nshows the largest area under the curve (it is lower but broader), indicating that it corresponds to \nmaximum electrical damping, i.e. most efficient power transfer from the piezoelectric bimorph to the \nresistor, where it is dissipated. With 20 k\u2126, a peak voltage amplitude of  6.1 V was detected at about \n310 Hz. \n \nFigure 4. Predicted average electrical power output P = (V0)\u00b2\/(2 \u00b7R) from a PZT-5H bimorph under \nharmonic excitation; different curves correspond to different electrical loads (the curve for 2 \u2126 is \nalmost undistinguishable from the x axis). . \n8\/16 \n \n \nFigure 5. Predicted displacement amplitude of the tip of a bimorph made of PZT-5H under harmonic \nexcitation and various electrical loads. \nThe picture is not complete without considering the corresponding displacements, which are plotted \nin Figure 5. The peak amplitude is minimum for the same resistor identified above as that \ncorresponding to maximum electrical damping (20 k\u2126). \nA combined observation of Figure 4 and Figure 5 highlights the fact that the electrical loads for \nwhich higher power is produced are also associated with larger displacements. However, it is well \nknown that excessive (tensile) strain in the piezoelectric ceramic can lead to a reduced operation life \nor even instantaneous failure, if particularly intense. It is therefore important to determine the resistor \nvalue that yields the maximum power whilst limiting the strain of the material. For this, it is \nnecessary to define an appropriate figure of merit in order to identify the optimal electrical load. This \nparameter must factor out the displacement (\u03b4) but at the same time include the effect of the \nelectrical load. The quantity V\/\u03b4 is not suitable as the voltage increases monotonically with the load \nand we would not be able to identify the optimal load and the corresponding power produced. On the \nother hand, P\/\u03b4 is also not appropriate as the power depends on the square of the displacement (via \nthe voltage). It is therefore  here proposed the use of the quantity: \n( )\n\u03b4\nP\n=Rf  4 \nIn Figure 6 we have plotted the figure of merit defined in Equation 4 for the device considered: the \nbest performance is obtained at 20 k\u2126, where f = 6.8 mmmW \/  at 311 Hz. This result confirms the \nqualitative impressions already gathered by looking at  Figure 4 and Figure 5, where we commented \nthat the wider curve found with the 20 k\u2126 resistor was indicative of large electrical damping, \nassociated to efficient energy conversion. \n \nFigure 6. Calculated \u201cfigure of merit\u201d as defined in Equation 4 to identify the optimal electrical load \n9\/16 \n \nof the PZT-5H bimorph under harmonic excitation. \n 4.2. Experimental harmonic response \nThe resonance frequency, tip displacement and voltage at resonance extracted from the experimental \nfrequency response curves are tabulated in Table 2, which also reports the corresponding results from \nthe model. The parameters fed to the FE model of the previous sections were modified to match the \ngeometrical characteristics of the bimorph available for testing and the testing conditions. In \nparticular, the free length was set at 22.5 mm, the quality factor was Qm = 35 (see section 4.5 for \nmore details) and seismic excitation was applied, with the base subject to an acceleration of \namplitude 7.1 m\/s\u00b2. From the table, it is seen that the resonance frequencies are predicted with an \nerror typically less than 1 % with the only exception of the short circuit condition, where the \nmismatch is 2 %. The displacement is accurate within 2 %, again with the exception of the short \ncircuit condition, where it is about 8%. It should be noted that the resistance of electrodes and \ncontacts makes it impossible to realize an ideal short circuit condition in experiments. Finally, the \nvoltage is generally underestimated by the model by 5 to 10 %. Overall, there is good agreement \nbetween experimental and modelling results. \n \nTable 2.

Simulated transient analysis: loading step \nThe transient analyses for the loading step were conducted with different deflection speeds to shed \nlight on their effect on the power output. In real operation, specifically in a knee-joint harvester, the \nrelative speed between plectrum and bimorph depend on the operating conditions, namely the phase \nof the gait cycle as the angular velocity of the knee joint is obviously not constant; the range of \noccurring speeds is also determined by the device geometry, in particular the radius of the plectra-\ncarrying ring, so it is a factor that needs to be considered during design. \nThe plots in Figure 7 were obtained by modelling a PZT-5H bimorph connected to a resistive load of \n20 k\u2126. The choice of load is dictated by the fact that this value was found to yield the highest power \nin the following release step. As the energy produced is significantly larger in the release step than in \nthe loading step, and it is not feasible to change the electrical load between the two steps in a real \n10\/16 \n \nharvester, precedence is given to the step with higher energy yield. The final imposed displacement is \nequal to 0.5 mm in all curves but the total time to reach full deflection is 2 ms in (a) and 5 ms in (b).  \nThe ripples visible in the graphs are due to natural vibrational modes, as the input is a forced \ndisplacement of the tip with constant loading speed (ramped loads). Note that a ramp is the best \napproximation of the deformation that is likely to be experienced by the bimorph in a harvester using \nplucking as the frequency up-conversion strategy. What emerges from a first look at the graphs is \nthat, having fixed the load resistor, both power and energy produced decrease as the deflection speed \ndecreases. This is not surprising. If we assume that the total charge Q produced by deflecting the \npiezoelectric material depends only on the final strain, so in particular we disregard the higher modes \nof vibration, we have: \n\u2206t\nRQ\n=E\n\u2206t\nRQ\n=RI=P\n\u2206t\nQ\n=I\n2\n2\n2\n2\n :alsoor     :so and   5 \nThis relation between the energy E and the deflection time \u2206t, was asymptotically observed by the \nmodelling results for slow deflections, as the higher modes become less important. This can be \nverified in Figure 8, which summarizes the effect of the speed of deflection on the energy produced. \n \n \n \n  \nFigure 7. Predicted energy (solid red lines) and power (dashed green lines) outputs plotted versus \ntime for a 0.5 mm deflection occurring in 2 ms  and 5 ms, as indicated on the abscissa. The electrical \nload is 20 k\u2126 in both cases. \n \nFigure 8. Predicted effect of the speed of deflection on the total energy produced in the loading step. \nThe curve asymptotically approaches a straight line as the deflection time increases, in agreement \nwith Equation 5 \n11\/16 \n \n 4.4. Simulated transient analysis: release step \nPerhaps the most interesting outcome of the FE analyses, and certainly the most useful results in \nview of the intended application, pertain to the behaviour of the cantilever upon release. With a full \ntransient analysis, we analysed the vibrations of the piezoelectric device and looked at the power \noutput at every substep, according to Equation 1.  \nFigure 9 and Figure 10 contain the plots of the cumulative energy (calculated according to \nEquation 3) and voltage, respectively, as a function of time. After being deflected very slowly by \n0.5 mm, the cantilever is released at time 1 s and its dynamics is followed for several milliseconds. \nThe deflection was set to occur over 1 s to ensure that velocities are zero at the time of release (the \ntime axis starts at 1 s in the graphs as a reminder of this). The many curves in Figure 9 (cumulative \nenergy) refer to different loading conditions, from 1 \u2126 to 500 k\u2126,  as specified on the plot. The \nvoltage measured across a subset of resistors is plotted in Figure 10. An interesting feature apparent \nin the voltage across the 500 k\u2126 resistor is the fact that, despite oscillating, the voltage tends to stay \nnegative and slowly drifts upwards. This is explained considering that the bimorph was quasi-\nstatically deflected before release, while current flew through the external circuit. Therefore, just \nbefore release the bimorph is mechanically deflected but has free charges on the electrodes that \nbalance the polarization-induced charges. To understand the behaviour upon release it is best to refer \nto an ideal open circuit situation; in this case, the voltage would remain negative, oscillating around a \nmid value until mechanical dissipation would bring the bimorph at rest, whilst the voltage would be \ndetermined by the free charge present at the beginning (which could not migrate due to the open \ncircuit condition). This remnant voltage would also keep the bimorph somewhat deflected in the \noriginal direction. With finite resistors, the charges can migrate more or less quickly and eventually \nthe bimorph reaches a static undeformed shape with equi-potential electrodes. \nFrom the graphs, it is apparent that the bimorph produces 59 \u00b5J across 20 k\u2126. Table 3 collects the \noverall efficiency under different loads. In reading this table one must remember that the only \ndamping taken into account is the internal damping of the material, while air damping and electrical \nor dielectric losses were neglected. \n \nFigure 9. Predicted cumulative energy produced by the bimorph upon release after a deformation of \n0.5 mm lasting 1 s. The slow deformation ensures that the bimorph is not vibrating at the time of \nrelease. \n12\/16 \n \n    \nFigure 10.

Only a subset of electrical loads is shown for conciseness.  \nTable 3.

These graphs are to be used while deciding the optimal frequency of plucking actions. \nThe average power increases rather rapidly in the first few milliseconds, and then it starts decaying \u2013 \nthe first few oscillations are quite ample, but the amplitude decreases roughly exponentially and so \ndoes the additional energy produced; as Figure 9 shows, the total energy saturates rather quickly. The \n13\/16 \n \nhighest power output is obtained when the plots in Figure 11 reach their maximum. However, at \nthose times the bimorph is still vibrating with large amplitudes\/speeds and a subsequent contact with \nthe plectrum may occur at high speed, damaging the device. The plots of Pav show that if plucking \nactions occur every 5 to 10 ms, average powers in the range 5 to 7 mW can be achieved. As human \nactivities are not perfectly repeatable, any human-integrated device is likely to operate over a wide \nrange of conditions; this means that it is not possible to design a harvester working constantly at the \noptimal plucking frequency.  \nIn addition, the electrical load that gives the maximum Figure of Merit (in Figure 6) is the one that \ngives the maximum average power (in Figure 11) in the time interval at which we intend to repeat the \nplucking. For the purpose of designing real devices, it is therefore appropriate to acquire frequency \nresponse curves for the device with different resistors and identify the one that maximizes the Figure \nof Merit defined in Equation 4. This will then represent the input resistance of the power \nmanagement circuit that maximizes power transfer during plucking-based frequency up-conversion. \n \n \nFigure 11. Predicted average power produced under different electrical loads in the first 20 ms upon \nrelease. \n 4.5. Experimental plucking actions \nIn order to validate the model's predictions with respect to plucking excitation, experimental data \nwere collected on a bimorph plucked by a plectrum while its terminals were connected to a 25 k\u2126 \nload. The velocity near the free end of the bimorph, the voltage output and the resulting energy are \nplotted in Figure 12 with solid lines; the figure also shows the results from the model (dashed lines). \nThe geometrical input parameters of the model were modified to reflect the available bimorph and \nthe testing conditions (in particular, the length of clamped region). As regards the initial conditions, \nsince the initial deflection of the bimorph could not be directly measured with sufficient accuracy, the \nvelocity \u2013 measured by LDV \u2013 was used instead. Specifically, the initial displacement of the tip of \nthe bimorph was set in the model so that the first peak of the FE velocity data coincides with the first \npeak of the experimental data (this point is marked by a symbol on Figure 12). It was found that the \ninitial condition that satisfies this requirement is a tip deflection of 88 \u00b5m. The mechanical quality \nfactor Qm introduced in the FE model was calculated from the exponential decay of the vibrations \nrecorded after a plucking excitation in open circuit conditions. The calculated value (Qm= 35) \ndiffered slightly from that tabulated on the supplier's datasheet for the material (Qm= 32). \nIt can be seen from Figure 12 that the model predictions are very accurate. The only disagreement \nbetween model and experiment occurs in the neighbourhood of the release time (t=0 s). Whilst the \nmodel naturally predicts a prompt increase of velocity as soon as the displacement constraint is \nremoved, the experimental data show an unclean start, with the velocity increasing more slowly and \n14\/16 \n \nalso with some \u201cnoise\u201d (just before t=0 s). This can be explained by considering that both bimorph \nand plectrum have a thickness larger than the initial deflection and that their contact edges are not \nperfectly parallel. Therefore, when the overlap between plectrum and bimorph reduces, they rub \nagainst each other, causing some energy loss at the beginning and a \u201cdirty\u201d release. In fact, time-\nintegration of the experimental velocity would suggest that initially (at t= -1 ms in Figure 12), the \nbimorphs is actually deflected by about 120 \u00b5m. This means that for the first 32 \u00b5m the bimorph is \nstarting to spring back but is not completely free as contact with the plectrum persists. This is \nimportant for the harvesting device as it means that the full deflection of the bimorph, as defined by \ncompatibility with the maximum deflection permitted, cannot be completely exploited at the \nmoment. There is however scope for increasing the energy output by achieving a cleaner, sharper \nrelease. These tests show an energy generation exceeding 2 \u00b5J; other tests, with larger deflections of \nthe bimorph have produced approximately 40 \u00b5J. \nAs regards the frequency of oscillations, the agreement between model and experiment is very good \nwith 294 Hz (model) vs. 291 Hz (experiment). \n \nFigure 12. Comparison between experimental results (solid blue line) and model (dashed red line) \nfor plucking excitation. In the plots: voltage measured across a 25 k\u2126 resistor, velocity of the tip and \nelectrical energy dissipated by the resistor during a single plucking action. The symbol on the \nvelocity plot indicates the point at which the model output velocity was matched to the experimental \nmeasurement. \n 5. Conclusions \nPiezoelectric energy harvesters often have to battle with contrasting frequency requirements: the \navailable vibrations are low-frequency, but the harvester's active element performs best at high \nfrequencies. For this reason, we propose to use mechanical plucking as the frequency up-conversion \nstrategy for human-based EH. Bimorph plucking means that a piezoelectric bimorph is deflected by \nmechanical contact with a plectrum so that, when rapidly released, it may vibrate around its rest \n15\/16 \n \nposition at its own resonant frequency. During these vibrations, an important portion of the elastic \nenergy stored is converted into electrical energy. \nIn this paper we have presented a finite element model to simulate the response of a plucked \nbimorph, predicting voltage and energy dissipated across a resistor placed in series to the device. \nAlthough frequency up-conversion strategies have previous reports in the literature, as outlined in the \nintroduction, it is the first time that the plucking mode of operation is systematically studied and \nmodelled, with a view to human based energy harvesting. The results of this model give needed \ninsight for the design of energy-harvesters based on plucking as the frequency up-conversion \nstrategy. The model suggests that the optimal input resistance of the power management circuit can \nbe estimated by running simple (and already very commonly employed) tests with harmonic seismic \nexcitation. \nWe have reported experimental measurements, which fully validate the model. The model is very \ngood at predicting both the frequency response of the bimorph in harmonic excitation and the \ntransient response following a plucking action. A slight mismatch between model and experiment \nvelocity data at the time of release has allowed us to identify the action of releasing the bimorph as a \npotentially major source of energy dissipation. More specifically, if the release is not sufficiently \nclean, as happens when the contact between plectrum and bimorph is lost over a significant distance \nof relative motion, the initial deflection of the bimorph cannot be fully exploited for energy \ngeneration.  \nWe are currently working towards a human-based harvester exploiting the plucking strategy; the \ndevice will be worn on the knee and is expected to produce usable power sufficient to keep electronic \ngadgets, such as MP3 players or even mobile phones, permanently charged. \nAcknowledgements \nThis research is sponsored by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) via \ngrant No. EP\/H020764\/1. \nReferences \n1 S.
