The cytotoxic mode of action\nof this family of compounds is understood to be related to\ntheir ability to bind and inhibit the enzyme type 1 topoi-\nsomerase (Topo-1), which is involved in the replication and\nrepair of DNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle [1]. As\nDNA is replicated in dividing cells, Topo-1 acts by binding\nto super-coiled DNA and causing controlled single-stran-\nded breaks which relieve the torsional stresses that are\nintroduced into DNA ahead of the replication complex or\nmoving replication fork. Topotecan inhibits Topo-1 by\nstabilizing the covalent complex of enzyme and strand-\ncleaved DNA, inducing uncontrolled single and double\nstrand breaks in the DNA and damage to the replication\nfork which results in cell death. Topotecan is expected to\nR. E. J. Forster \u0002 S. A. Small \u0002 Y. Tang \u0002\nC. L. Heaysman \u0002 A. L.

Its\nchemical structure consists of a fused ring structure con-\ntaining a lactone ring which is vital to its Topo-1 binding\naction. The lactone is hydrolysed at neutral pH and above\nto form the open-ring carboxylate which is inactive; hence,\nit is important to the activity of any formulation of this\ndrug that the closed ring lactone form is maintained.\nDC Bead has been recently commercialised and used\nsuccessfully in the clinic for the local treatment of hepato-\ncellular carcinoma [3\u20135], various neuroendocrine metasta-\nses [6] and colorectal cancer metastases to the liver [7, 8]\nby transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) of the feeding\narteries of the malignancies. More recent preclinical studies\nhave shown that it is feasible to administer DC Bead by\nother routes, for instance by intraperitoneal (IP) injection\nfor the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis [9], or by\ndirect intratumoral (IT) injection as a therapy for glioblas-\ntoma multiforme [10]. The DC Bead is based upon a sul-\nfonate-modified polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel, which permits\nloading and subsequent delivery of variety of positively-\ncharged chemotherapeutic agents including doxorubicin,\nmitoxantrone and irinotecan [11\u201313]. The beads are avail-\nable in a number of size ranges from 100\u2013300 lm,\n300\u2013500 lm and 500\u2013700 lm, with the two smaller size\nranges being most popular for embolisation of tumours. It\nhas been demonstrated that affinity between drug and bead\nis promoted by the ionic interaction of their opposite\ncharges. In the case of irinotecan (another water-soluble\ncamptothecin derivative), the lactone ring formation is\nmaintained intact by this ionic interaction which drives the\nequilibrium in favour of the positively-charged lactone\nform over the zwitterionic carboxylate [14].\nTopotecan is available as a formulated product known\ncommercially as Hycamptin\u0003 containing as the active ingre-\ndient topotecan hydrochloride. It is positively charged by\nvirtue of the pendent dimethylamine hydrochloride salt,\nwhich differs somewhat to that of the salt formed on the\ndipiperidino ring of irinotecan. It does, however, possess\nthe same lactone-ring structure as irinotecan and could be\nexpected to benefit from the same mode of preservation of\nthe active form [14] (Fig. 1). Irinotecan is a prodrug that\nrequires the cleavage of the dipiperidino side chain by\ncarboxylesterases present in the body to generate the more\npotent active metabolite SN-38. Topotecan does not require\nthis enzymatic activation and is therefore used in very much\nlower doses (typically 1\u20132 mg m-2 compared to several\nhundred mg m-2 for irinotecan [15]). The early uses of\ntopotecan as a chemotherapeutic agent have been in the\ntreatment of ovarian cancer and small cell lung cancer\n(SCLC) but studies have also been performed in the treat-\nment of brain tumours [16]. Its systemic use has significant\nside effects including diarrhoea, neutropenia and increased\nsusceptibility to infection. It therefore possesses several\nattributes that make it an excellent candidate to consider for\nlocal delivery using DEB: high potency but with systemic\ntoxicity; active against a range of cancer types; positively\ncharged salt for ionic interaction; available in a formulation\nthat could be used to load the drug immediately prior to a\nprocedure (as is currently performed using DC Bead to load\ndoxorubicin or irinotecan prior to a TACE procedure [17]).\nThe loading efficacy of irinotecan has already been estab-\nlished [17]. In this study we present in vitro characterisation\nof DEBTOP, with respect to drug loading capacity, elution\ncharacteristics, mechanical properties of the device and\nsome preliminary investigations into efficacy using an in\nvitro and in vivo pancreatic carcinoma models.\n2 Materials and methods\n2.1 Materials\nTopotecan hydrochloride powder (Dabur Pharma Ltd.,\nGhaziabad, India) was dissolved in distilled water ([17.0\nMX) to produce appropriate loading solutions. DC Bead\n(sulfonate-modified polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel beads from\nBiocompatibles UK Ltd., Farnham, UK) were used in the\nsize range of 300\u2013500 lm to assess drug loading, elution\nand cell viability, due to ease of handling compared to the\nsmaller size. 100\u2013300 lm beads were used for animal\nstudies as the tumours themselves were only 0.2 cm3 and\nthe smallest available size product was most appropriate\nfor small gauge needle delivery. In order to ensure the\nbeads were retained at the site of injection and not\nextravasated, they were suspended in a 0.6 wt\/vol alginate\nsolution (ultra-pure Phycomer E01, CellMed AG, Alzenau,\nN\nN\nO\nOH\nNH\nO\nOOH\nN\nN\nOH\nNH\nO\nOOH\nO\nOH\n-\nOH\nO\nSO3\nOH O O OH\nNH\nO\nn\n-\n+ + CL\nDC Bead polymer  \nFig. 1 Chemical structure of DC Bead and its proposed interaction\nwith the active lactone (L) form of topotecan. The active lactone form\nis believed to bind to the DEBs and elute in this form. Once eluted\ntopotecan can behave like free topotecan and converts to the more\nstable inactive carboxylate (C) form\nJ Mater Sci: Mater Med\n123\nGermany) which is mannuronic acid rich and has a\nmolecular weight of approximately 800,000 and hence\nhelps to increase viscosity of the suspension. For\ncompressibility studies, DC Bead in the size range of\n900\u20131200 lm were used as these produce the most con-\nsistent mechanical data. Solutions used in loading and\nelution analysis included a 50:50 mix (v\/v) of ethanol\n(Romil Ltd., UK): saturated potassium chloride solution\n(Fisher Scientific UK Ltd., UK) and phosphate buffered\nsaline solution (PBS) (Inverclyde Biologicals, UK) solu-\ntions respectively.\n2.2 Preparation of DEBTOP and determination of drug\nloading level\nDEBTOP was prepared by removing the packing solution\nfrom 1 ml of 300\u2013500 lm DC Bead and then adding the\ndrug solution to the vial containing the bead slurry. In order\nto assess the maximum loading capacity, DC Bead was\nexposed to topotecan solutions containing between 2 and\n100 mg for 3 h. The vials were agitated on a roller mixer.\nTo determine total dose loaded, the loaded beads were\nremoved from their solution, transferred to 500 ml of 50:50\nmix of ethanol: saturated KCl solution and stirred at\n700 rpm for 7 h. Use of this rapid-elution medium ensured\nthat all drug was extracted from the beads [12]. This was\nconfirmed by use of HPLC analysis of the extraction\nsolution and mass balance comparison with any residual\ndrug remaining in the loading solution. The HPLC setup\ncomprised of a C18 reverse phased column and an 85:15\nwater:acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid mobile\nphase pumped at 1.2 ml min-1 (isocratic). The mobile\nphase was \\pH 3 to ensure that topotecan present was\nconverted to its lactone form to aid analysis. The injection\nvolume was 20 ll and the sample was detected using UV\nabsorption at 228 nm.\nTo assess the effect of agitated loading, beads exposed\nto 6 mg topotecan (6 ml, 1 mg ml-1 solution) were either\nroller-mixed during loading or left static for three hours. A\n100 ll aliquot of the loading solution was removed from\nthe sample at set time points over three hours and diluted\nwith 900 ll of water prior to HPLC analysis as described\nabove.\n2.3 Bead sizing and appearance\nThe size and appearance of individual DC Beads during\ntopotecan loading and elution were examined by use of an\nOlympus BX50F4 microscope with a Colorview III Cam-\nera (Olympus, Japan), under an aqueous solution. Sizing\ndata were analysed using AnalySIS (Soft Imaging System\nGmbH) software.\n2.4 Compressibility of DEBTOP\nAnalysis of DC Bead compressibility was conducted with\n900\u20131200 lm beads as the technique was less sensitive for\nsmaller beads. DC Bead with and without drug loading\nunder an aqueous solution was assessed using an Instron\n4411 with Series IX software (Instron, Canton, MA, USA)\nas previously described [17]. The general procedure\ninvolved distributing the beads onto a specially-fabricated\nsample holder on the Instron to form a monolayer of about\n7\u201310 mm in width. The residual water around the beads\nwas carefully removed by wicking using a filter paper. The\ndiameter of the probe used was 5.0 mm with a crosshead\nspeed of 5.0 mm min-1. The load cell used was 50 N and\nthe specimen gauge length was set as 1.0 mm. All the\nexperiments were carried out at room temperature.\nThe load and compression modulus was calculated from\nthe slope of the curve versus percentage strain at 8\u201316%\ncompression strain. Five measurements were performed\nper sample at room temperature.\n2.5 In vitro release of topotecan into various media\nThe elution profiles of DEBTOP were evaluated in PBS at\nroom temperature. Two loading doses were assessed; 6 mg\n(low) and 30 mg (high) topotecan ml-1 hydrated DC\nBead. The loaded beads were then extracted into 500 ml of\nPBS at room temperature by stirring with a magnetic\nstirrer at a speed of 700 rpm. A 1.5 ml aliquot of the\nelution solution was removed from the sample at set times\nover 7 h and analysed by HPLC. The percentage of\ntopotecan eluted from the beads was then calculated as a\nfunction of time.\n2.6 In vitro PSN-1 cytotoxicity\nHuman pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PSN-1) cells (pur-\nchased frozen from ECACC UK, 94060601) were seeded\nat a density of 20,000 cells per well (96 well plate) in\nRPMI (PAA, UK) media containing 10% Fetal Bovine\nSerum, (PAA, UK). The cells were incubated under stan-\ndard conditions (5% CO2, 37\u0004C) overnight. The media was\nthen removed and replaced with either free topotecan or\nirinotecan concentrations (0.00001\u20131000 lg ml-1 media)\nor a single topotecan or irinotecan loaded DC Bead (6 and\n30 mg drug ml-1 DC Bead) in 200 ll of media. An MTS\nassay (Promega, UK) was used to determine to number of\nviable cells at 24, 48 and 72 h. Cell viability was expressed\nas a percentage of control (untreated) cells. Differences in\ncell viabilities were analysed using a Bonferroni Student\u2019s\nt-test with a P value of\\0.05 being defined as statistically\nsignificant.\nJ Mater Sci: Mater Med\n123\n2.7 In vivo nude mouse xenograft\nAnimal studies were performed by Exp. Pharmacol. &\nOncol. GmbH, (Berlin-Buch, Germany) in accordance with\nlocal regulations (granted by the LAGeSo, State Office of\nHealth and Social Affairs, Berlin). PSN-1 tumour pieces\n(human pancreatic carcinoma) were prepared from an in\nvitro passage for subcutaneous transplantation in female\nnude mice. Mice were randomised to the scheduled treat-\nment groups (n = 3 per group). When the tumours became\npalpable (0.2 cm3), the DC Bead\/alginate mixture was\ninjected close to the subcutaneous growing tumour, using a\n1 ml syringe (B.Braun, Germany) fitted with a G16 needle\n(0.6 9 25 mm, Terumo Europe, Belgium). Prior to injec-\ntion all the lyophilised gamma-sterilised DC Bead (1 ml\npre dehydration) were hydrated on the day of administra-\ntion by the addition of 3 ml alginate solution. The delivery\nvolume was 100 ll or 200 ll per mouse. In some cases,\nwhen the mean tumour size was C20% larger than the\nprevious time point a repeat injection was performed at a\ndifferent site next to the tumour compared to the previous\ninjection. The doses and volumes injected are shown in\nTable 3. Tumour volumes and body weights were recorded\ntwice weekly. Mice were sacrificed when the tumours\nreached an average size of [1 cm3.\n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 Topotecan loading profiles\nThe available topotecan is adsorbed in a linear fashion\n(R2 = 0.999) relative to the loading solution concentration\ninto DC Bead at a dose matching &88% of the available\ndrug, up to 35 mg (Fig. 2). The residual salt within the\npacking solution exchanging with ionically bound topotecan\nwas thought to be the reason that all of the available topo-\ntecan only loaded to&88%. The loading appears to plateau\nat a maximum around 40\u201345 mg topotecan ml-1 of unloa-\nded DC Bead. These data suggest that all the binding sites\nare saturated, so even if more topotecan is available it cannot\nbind to the bead, merely partition into its water fraction. The\nbinding interaction between the drug and bead is attributed\nto the negatively charged sulfonate group within the bead\nand the positively charged protonated amine group on the\ntopotecan molecule (Fig. 1). The calculated theoretical\nnumber of available binding sites (sulfonate groups) in 1 ml\nbeads is 7.7 9 10-5 mol [17]. This would equate to a\nloading of 35 mg, which is less than the observed maximum\nloading. This indicates that more than one topotecan mole-\ncule is binding per sulfonate group. This could be achieved\nby the drug interacting with itself as it becomes concentrated\nin the bead matrix. It is known in the literature that topotecan\ndoes form dimers at high concentrations [18].\nIt was observed that topotecan partitioned into DC Bead\nfrom the 6 mg loading solution faster when the system was\nagitated compared to stationary loading (Fig. 3). The larger\nerror associated with static loading was attributed to\nunintentional solution movement when sample was\nremoved for analysis. Agitation helps to disturb the elec-\ntrical double-layer build up of ions at the beads surface\nwhich otherwise impedes the loading process in the static\nsituation. Loading was achieved in \\20 min when DC\nBead was agitated; it is considered that this would be an\nacceptable time for DC Bead preparation in the pharmacy\nprior to use.\n3.2 Bead sizing and appearance\nPost topotecan loading, DC Bead exhibited a yellow\/green\nhue, which was more intense upon higher drug loading.\nThis colour was due to a combination of the blue tint of the\nmicrosphere and the inherent yellow\/green colour of the\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nAvailable Topotecan in Loading Solution (mg)T\nop\not\nec\nan\n E\nxt\nra\nct\ned\n fr\nom\n 1\n m\nL \nDE\nB \n(m\ng)\nA B C\nFig. 2 Topotecan bound to 1 ml of DC Bead compared to the\navailable topotecan.

The bead size was shown to decrease\nwith higher topotecan loading (Table 1).\n3.3 Compressibility\nThe compression properties of the beads provide an indi-\ncation of how they will deform when passing through a\nmicrocatheter, needle or blood vessel. Compared to the\nunloaded beads, DC Bead, topotecan loaded exhibited\nsignificantly higher compression moduli. Resistance to\ncompression was associated with increased drug loading\n(Table 2). The increase in compression and decrease in\nbead size with drug loading were attributed to the hydro-\nphobic nature of the topotecan molecules displacing the\nwater molecules from the hydrogel. Similar phenomena\nwere observed with doxorubicin and irinotecan loaded DC\nBead [17]. In addition, the change in compression and bead\nsize may be exaggerated due to the association capabilities\nof topotecan, which is able to self-aggregate at higher\nconcentrations to form dimers [18]. This may act as extra\ncrosslinking junctions, consequently decreasing the dis-\ntance between polymer chains (reducing bead size),\nexpelling water and increasing resistance to compression.\n3.4 In vitro drug release\nTopotecan elution is retarded by its interaction with the DC\nBead. Figure 4 shows that the elution is dependent on the\namount of topotecan loaded. At lower loading (6 mg)\ntopotecan has fully eluted from the DC Bead after 30 min,\nwhilst at higher loading (30 mg) the drug takes around\n180 min to fully elute. Topotecan did not elute from DC\nBead when the elution medium was water, but was liber-\nated from the beads when the medium was changed to\nphosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Fig. 4, inset). PBS, a\nmedium more representative of biological fluids, facilitates\nthe release of topotecan through ion exchange; a process\nnot available in distilled water.\nThe diffusion coefficient, D, for this system was calcu-\nlated using the method described by Taylor [17]. The D\nvalues when \\85% of the loaded drug was eluted were\n2.6 9 10-7 and 5.9 9 10-8 cm2 s-1 for the 6 and\n30 mg ml-1 loadings respectively. The diffusion coeffi-\ncient decreases with increasing drug loading and the dif-\nference in topotecan elution can be attributed to the higher\nhydrophobicity of topotecan or potential dimerisation of\ntopotecan, both resulting in drug-drug interaction and\npossessing a tighter network through which the drug must\npermeate.\n3.5 In vitro PSN-1 cytotoxicity\nPancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were used as a model to\ntest the efficacy of topotecan and irinotecan delivery from\nDC Bead. Topotecan has been prescribed in patients with\nadvanced pancreatic cancer in clinical models but was not\nvery successful in the dosing regimes attempted. A dose\nadministered as a 30 min infusion at a dose of 1.5 mg m-2\nday-1 for five consecutive days every 3 weeks has been\nshown to exhibit toxicity (neutropenia) and no significant\nantitumour responses [19]. Alternative dosing regimes at\n0.5 mg m-2 day-1 over 21 days exhibited 8% partial\nresponse, with reversible and non-cumulative toxicity\n(myelosuppression) [20]. Localised therapies may offer a\nmethod for enhancing efficacy and reducing systemic side\neffects in vivo and we have shown in the previous sections\nTable 1 Topotecan loaded ml-1 DC Bead and corresponding\ndiameter (n = 200)\nTopotecan loaded (mg) Size (lm)\nMean Std.

The IC50 for irinotecan\nat 72 h was 19.2 lM, slightly higher than the 1\u201310 lM\nrange reported previously [21]. The cytotoxicity of topo-\ntecan was greater than irinotecan at the same concentra-\ntions for all time points as demonstrated by an IC50 some\ntwo orders of magnitude less (Table 3, Fig. 5). The IC50\nvalues obtained for topotecan were not dissimilar to those\nobtained by other workers using MCF-7 human breast\ncancer [22] or U87 human glioma cell lines [23], which for\ncomparison were in the range 0.037\u20130.280 lM. At earlier\ntime points and lower concentrations both drugs elicited a\nsmall increase in cell number, which is thought to be a\ncellular response to stress. At higher concentrations and\nlater time points, cellular death was observed. Interestingly,\nat the highest concentration for both drugs at 72 h, the\ncytotoxicity was slightly less than the corresponding 48 h\ndata, indicating possible drug-resistance mechanisms may\nbe initiated. When exposed to a single topotecan loaded\nDC Bead, reduction in PSN-1 cell viability was observed\nfor both 6 and 30 mg ml-1 loadings at statistically greater\nlevels than for the corresponding DEBIRI (Fig. 6). For\ncomparison, DEBIRI exhibited signs of cytotoxicity after\n48 and 72 h, but not at 24 h. Topotecan is cytotoxic when\neluted from the DC Bead, indicating that topotecan main-\ntains its activity upon elution. The comparison with\nDEBIRI highlights the greater potency of topotecan despite\ntheir matching concentrations.\n3.6 In vivo mouse PSN-1 xenograft response\nThe growth of PSN-1 tumours was inhibited with DEBTOP\nor DEBIRI administered subcutaneously in nude mice\n(Table 4, Fig. 7). The higher doses of topotecan (1.2 and\n0.83 mg) were lethal to all the mice after six days, whilst\nthe lower concentrations (0.4 and 0.2 mg) showed some\nefficacy in reducing the tumour volume. The control mice\nshowed severe body weight loss when the tumours reached\na larger tumour volume, which was attributed to tumour\ninduced cachexia. Based on this measure of toxicity, all\ngroups (except the toxic higher topotecan doses) showed no\nsignificant weight loss, indicating that the treatments were\nwell tolerated.\nIn agreement with the in vitro results, a much lower dose\nof topotecan was required to elicit a cytotoxic effect\ncompared to irinotecan. From all of the samples tested\nhere, the higher irinotecan dose showed the greatest\npotential for survival for 57 days post the tumour implant.\nTable 3 Irinotecan hydrochloride and topotecan hydrochloride IC50\nfor PSN-1 cells\nDrug IC50 mg ml\n-1 IC50 lM\n48 h 72 h 48 h 72 h\nIrinotecan 13 19 28.1 19.2\nTopotecan 0.101 0.123 0.27 0.22\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n0.00001 0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000\nConcentration (\u00b5g ml-1)\nPS\nN1\n C\nel\nl V\nia\nbi\nlity\n (%\n C\non\ntro\nl)\nFig. 5 PSN-1 kill curve for increasing concentrations of free\ntopotecan (j) 48 h and (m) 72 h exposure) and free irinotecan (h)\n48 h and (D) 72 h exposure (n = 7, mean \u00b1 SD)\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n724824\nTime (hours)\nPS\nN1\n C\nel\nl V\nia\nbi\nlit\ny \n(%\n co\nnt\nro\nl)\nTopotecan 6 mg\/ml\nTopotecan 30 mg\/ml \nIrinotecan 6 mg\/ml\nIrinotecan 30 mg\/ml \nFig. 6 Cell viability after exposure to a single DEBTOP or DEBIRI\nfor 24, 48 and 72 h (n = 7, mean \u00b1 SD)\nTable 4 Group information for mouse xenograft study\nGroup Bead\ntype\nAmount of drug\nloaded per ml of\nbeads\nTotal volume\n(alginate and DEB)\ninjected (ll)\nDose\n(mg)\nA Unloaded 0 100 0\nB DEBIRI 100 100 3.3\nC 100 200 6.6\nD DEBTOP 37 100 1.2\nE 25 100 0.83\nF 12 100 0.4\nG 6 100 0.2\nJ Mater Sci: Mater Med\n123\nTwo mice from this group demonstrated significant tumour\nshrinkage, with one demonstrating [99% shrinkage after\n47 days and no signs of regrowth after 57 days. One mouse\nin this group did demonstrate significant tumour growth\nafter 36 days. The variability in the groups may be due to\ninconsistencies in the exact location of the injection site\nrelative to the tumour; moreover, the tumours grow het-\nerogeneously and sometimes have a capsule, areas with\nnecrotic tissue or larger blood vessels, the variation from\nwhich will have been further exacerbated by the low\nnumber of animals per group. In the higher irinotecan dose\ntreatment, an increase in tumour size was observed after\n19 days. Whilst this could either be due to drug resistance\nor insufficient drug, the reduction in tumour size after the\nsecond injection demonstrates that the initial growth is\nlikely due to the latter effect (Fig. 7).\n4 Conclusions\nIn summary, topotecan can be easily loaded into DC Bead\nwithin 20 min when the solution and beads are agitated.\nThe process is slower without agitation as the loading is\nreliant upon diffusion. As has been seen with doxorubicin\nand irinotecan, loading with higher concentrations of\ntopotecan changed the colour as well as size and com-\npressibility of the DC Bead. These factors changed within\nthe expected range and were markedly different at higher\n(30 mg ml-1) concentrations. The release from 1 ml DC\nBead took 30 or 180 min to fully elute in a PBS sink\nenvironment for 6 and 30 mg topotecan loading respec-\ntively. Topotecan efficacy against human pancreatic car-\ncinoma cells was demonstrated in vitro both as a free drug\nand from DEBTOP, where it was shown to be more potent\nwith an IC50 two orders of magnitude lower than DEBIRI.\nBoth irinotecan and topotecan demonstrate the capacity to\nbe loaded and eluted from DC Bead and show efficacy in a\nnude mouse human pancreatic adenoma xenograft model.\nThe best treatment (DEBIRI) reduced the tumour by[99%\nin one mouse, extending the average time it took for the\ntumour to become 1 cm3 in size from 13 to 57 days and\ndemonstrated the feasibility and tolerability of repeat direct\ninjections. Higher doses of topotecan (0.83\u20131.2 mg) how-\never, were lethal at 6 days post injection, which serves to\nhighlight that dose selection is still critical when consid-\nering the balance between efficacy and severe toxicity\/\ndeath. Overall, the treatment with either DEBIRI or\nDEBTOP was well tolerated and could be considered as a\nmethod to treat pancreatic cancer either through direct\ninjection or via arterial administration.\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the\nCreative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which per-\nmits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any\nmedium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.\nReferences\n1.
