\u00b7 Management plans are recapped on leaving the unit; \u00b7 Issues\/problems  in  enacting  the  care  plan  are  discussed  with  team members, and guidance is given on technical\/organisational issues; \u00b7 Medical trainees and nursing staff are made aware of new information on their unit or patient responsibilities (e.g. admissions, test results); \u00b7 Trainee doctors are observed performing tricky procedures so to detect indicators (e.g. stress, distraction, nurse unease) of a need to intervene; \u00b7 Tasks which trainees have not previously performed, or are struggling to perform,  are  supervised  or  performed  by  the  senior  physician  for demonstration and skill retention purposes; \u00b7 Team  members  co-ordination  is  assessed  (e.g.  task  duplication, information sharing), and instructions given where necessary (e.g. reconfirming tasks, priorities and inter-dependencies);   Crisis Management  Developing crisis management plans, and providing directive leadership during emergency situations.  \u00b7 A  concise analysis of  the situation from the  trainee doctors\/senior nurse is requested; \u00b7 Where  situation  is  managed  by  a  trainee  physician,  indicators showing need for senior physician intervention are monitored (e.g. trainee indecision, severity of illness, management plan quality); \u00b7 When performing tasks requiring high-levels of attention (e.g. line insertion),  team  members  instructed  to  verbally  update  on  new information (e.g. physiological measures); \u00b7 Information is considered \u2018aloud\u2019 in order to share and confirm (i.e. identify inconsistencies) team member perspectives; \u00b7 Future  situational\/system  information  requirements  are  identified (e.g. availability of surgical support); \u00b7 A  crisis  management  plan  is  quickly  developed\/adapted  with  the support of team members, and situational overview is communicated; \u00b7 As required, team members opinions are sought on the management plan, and alternative ideas considered if appropriate; \u00b7 Task priorities and contingency plans are quickly communicated to the team;

 \u00b7 Decision-making authority assumed if trainee is not coping, or if patient safety may be at risk (e.g. time constraints, illness complexity) \u00b7 Decision-making authority is asserted through clearly and appropriately delegating tasks (e.g. by seniority), and by giving precise instructions; \u00b7 Calmness  is  shown  in  decision-making,  and  team  members  are encouraged to contribute information to the decision-making process; \u00b7 Difficulties in team members performing technical tasks are anticipated, with the senior physician being prepared to supervise or dynamically swap functions with trainees as necessary; \u00b7 Should  another  team  member  or  specialist  be  better  suited  to performing a task than the senior physician, help is requested; \u00b7 Team  members  are  coordinated  through  them  confirming  their  task duties, and providing constant updates on task progression; \u00b7 As  control  is  gained  of  the  situation,  decision-making  is  distributed back to senior trainee and nursing staff; To be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B.

(In Press). Team Leadership in the Intensive Care Unit: The Perspective of Specialists. Critical Care Medicine. \n 3 \n \nTeam leadership refers to the actions undertaken by a team leader to ensure the needs and \ngoals of a team are met (1). Team leadership is distinct from organisational or strategic \nleadership (2), and a team leader can be characterised as the individual(s) engaged in, and \nresponsible for, guiding a team through its work cycle (1). Psychology research shows \nthe skills and behaviours of team leaders (e.g. for defining goals, setting expectations, \nmonitoring teamwork) to predict team performance in experimental and work settings (2-\n8). In the intensive care unit (ICU), team leadership is crucial for determining the extent \nto which teams provide co-ordinated and safe patient care (figure 1) (9-13). Senior ICU \nphysicians (e.g. specialists, staff attendings, or consultants) are usually identified as the \nteam leader due to their formal responsibilities for providing patient care, although other \nteam members (e.g. fellows and nursing staff) may also demonstrate leadership \nbehaviours (14, 15). The importance of leadership in the ICU is acknowledged by current \ntraining systems (e.g. the Competency Based Training programme in Intensive Care \nMedicine for Europe (CoBaTRICE) programme (16)). However, there is only limited \nresearch on the specific skills and behaviours that constitute, and are indicative of, \neffective team leadership in the ICU (12), and there is a need to integrate healthcare \nleadership research with psychology theory (17).  Other high risk industries have \nidentified important leadership behaviors in granular detail so to build detailed training \nprogrammes (18-20), and such research would be informative for developing ICU team \nleadership training and assessment tools.  \n \nINSERT FIGURE 1 HERE \nTo be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team Leadership in the Intensive Care Unit: The Perspective of Specialists. Critical Care Medicine. \n 4 \n \nThis article aims to capture in detail the behaviours used by ICU team leaders to lead \nteams during both normal and emergency situations (termed functional leadership \nbehaviours (21, 22)), alongside the behaviours taken to create conditions that enable \neffective team performance (termed team development behaviours (21, 23, 24)). These \nbehaviours are particularly relevant for the ICU. For example, senior physician\u2019 \ninformation gathering activities (e.g. reviewing patient notes, discussions with nursing \nstaff), decision-making processes (e.g. during emergency scenarios), and support of team \nmembers (e.g. supervising trainees) are functional leadership behaviours important for \nICU team performance (12, 25-27). Senior physician\u2019 team development behaviours such \nas developing team norms (e.g. a culture of open communication) and shared team goals \nare also important for safety (12, 28). We aim to develop a framework of the leadership \nbehaviours used by ICU team leaders to guide their teams in providing safe and effective \npatient care.  \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nParticipants \nAll senior ICU physicians (UK consultants) from 7 hospitals (two District General and \nfive University hospitals) in the UK were contacted by letter to volunteer for the study \n(n=41). In total, 25 agreed (60%). On average, they had been in position for 11 years \n(range 1 to 25 years), with 22 males and 3 females. Ethical approval was given by NHS \nresearch ethics committee.   \nTo be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team Leadership in the Intensive Care Unit: The Perspective of Specialists. Critical Care Medicine. \n 5 \n \nDesign \nA semi-structured interview applying a variation of the critical incident technique was \nused (29). Experts are asked to describe their behaviours during a complex task where \nthey performed effectively. Insight is gained into the specific skills and behaviours \nunderpinning successful task performance. The interviews focused on leadership \nbehaviours used by senior physicians to lead ICU teams during routine and emergency \nphases of work. \n \nTeam leadership theory \nCurrent team leadership theory guided interview protocol design and data analysis (21-\n23). This literature shows team leaders to use functional leadership behaviours to \ninfluence team performance as a task is performed, and team development behaviours to \ndevelop the conditions\/environment within which team members will perform \neffectively. Table 1 defines and lists the categories of behaviour that underpin each \ndimension of team leadership.  \n \nInterview protocol \nIndustrial psychologists and intensive care specialists developed the interview schedule \n(see appendix 1). The interview content was influenced by interviewing principles (30, \n31), previous ICU leadership research (9, 12), and team leadership theory (21, 22, 23, \n32). Minor changes to the schedule were made after piloting. The interview structure was \nas follows: \nTo be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team Leadership in the Intensive Care Unit: The Perspective of Specialists. Critical Care Medicine. \n 6 \n\u2022 Phase 1.  Interviewees described a routine day in ICU, focussing on how they led the \nICU team to provide effective patient care. \n\u2022 Phase 2.  Interviewees recalled a critical event in ICU, and described the scenario, the \nteam\u2019s performance, outcomes, and their leadership of the team. \n\u2022 Phase 3.  Interviewees discussed the general leadership skills or behaviours they \nthought important for producing effective (or ineffective) team performance.  \n \nThe interview protocol included open-ended or direct questions, and additional generic \nprompts were used to spontaneously elicit information (e.g. \u2018how did you communicate \nthis?\u2019, or \u2018what indicated this to you?\u2019). The interviews were conducted by a single \ninterviewer (TR). All interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim for \nanalysis. \n \nAnalysis of interviews and coding reliability \nInterviews were analysed using content analysis (30), whereby transcripts are analysed \nusing an a priori framework to identify whether the interview captures concepts of \ninterest. Coders applied the following analysis procedure, with each interview transcript \nbeing: \n1. Read without notes being made.  \n2. Analysed to identify and code statements referring to functional leadership \nbehaviours (table 1).    \n3. Analysed to identify and code statements referring to team development \nbehaviours  (table 1).    \nTo be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team Leadership in the Intensive Care Unit: The Perspective of Specialists. Critical Care Medicine. \n 7 \n \nAll interviews were coded by a single coder (TR), with a randomly selected sample of 7 \ninterviews being independently coded by a trained Human Factors psychologist. An \nacceptable level of inter-rater reliability using Cohen\u2019s kappa co-efficient (33) was found \nbetween coders for statements relating to functional leadership behaviours (\u03ba = 0.72) and \nteam development (\u03ba = 0.75).   \n \nRESULTS \n \nSenior physicians (n=25) described the medical team as a hierarchical structure \nconsisting of themselves, and senior and junior trainee physicians. The nursing team was \ndescribed as a hierarchical structure of senior and bedside nurses. Although senior \nphysicians described leading the ICU team, the overlap between medical and nursing \nteams was not always clear. Furthermore, support staff were often considered part of the \nwider ICU team. The senior physicians focussed mainly on their leadership of the \nmedical team, although interactions with nurses were discussed.  \n \nAll interviewees discussed a \u2018unit assessment\u2019 phase at the beginning of a standard day in \nICU. Most senior physicians (n=21) described conducting an initial informal brief \nassessment on arrival, when they identified new patients, made ad-hoc management \nplans, met team members, and initialised urgent treatments. All senior physicians referred \nto a subsequent in-depth \u2018unit assessment\u2019 phase (i.e. the morning round) where patient \ninformation was collected from team members, diagnoses formed, care plans and \nTo be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team Leadership in the Intensive Care Unit: The Perspective of Specialists. Critical Care Medicine. \n 8 \ncontingencies formalised with trainee doctors, teaching performed, and tasks delegated. \nMost interviewees (n=24) described a transition from an \u2018in-depth\u2019 to an \u2018ongoing\u2019 \nassessment phase as the day progressed, whereby they monitored the progress of patient \nmanagement plans, intervened when problems arose, or adapted plans according to \nchanging circumstances. For interview phase two, 21 senior physicians described an \nemergency scenario they had experienced in the ICU, and described their leadership of \nthe team. Cases focused on sudden haemorrhages, resuscitations, major surgical \ncomplications, septic shock, cardiac arrests, drug overdoses, trauma victims, and sudden \ninfluxes of patients to busy ICUs. Three interviews focussed on non-ICU critical events, \nand one collected no second phase data (these interviews were removed from analysis of \nphase 2 data). Finally, all interviewees described the general leadership skills or \nbehaviours they thought represented effective or ineffective team leadership. \n  \nTable 2 shows the number of statements made by senior ICU physicians that referred to \nbehaviours within the functional leadership or team development dimensions (by \ninterview phase). Most  references were to functional leadership behaviours (76.5%).   \n \nINSERT TABLE 2 \n \nFunctional Leadership Behaviours \nReferences to functional leadership behaviours were made during interview phases 1 and \n2 (99%). Half of all 702 references (48%) were to behaviours for \u2018managing team \nmembers\u2019. Of behaviours relating to a routine day (phase 1), 29% referred to information \nTo be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team Leadership in the Intensive Care Unit: The Perspective of Specialists. Critical Care Medicine. \n 9 \ngathering, compared to 18% for critical events (phase 2). References to \u2018managing \nmaterials\u2019 accounted for just 3% of all behaviours, and this category was excluded from \nfurther analysis. Of the specific functional leadership behaviours discussed, some were \ndescribed by all interviewees (e.g. delegating tasks and tailoring instructions to the skills \nand knowledge of trainee staff), by a subset (e.g. 8 interviewees described applying \nprepared contingency plans in response to patient deteriorations), or by a single \ninterviewee (e.g. thinking aloud when gathering information). Furthermore, behaviours \nappeared specific to phases of work, for example developing patient plans (\u2018planning and \ndecision-making\u2019) during unit assessments (n=25), checking patient plan progression \n(\u2018information gathering\u2019) whilst monitoring the ICU (n=22), and assuming decision-\nmaking authority (\u2018managing team members\u2019) during emergencies (n=14).   \n \nTable 3 synthesises and lists the functional leadership behaviours described by senior \nphysicians. The focus is on behaviours discussed by more than one interviewee  (i.e. \ncommonly used strategies), although behaviours discussed by a single interviewee were \nincluded if there was sufficient rationale (e.g. consistency with the leadership literature). \nTo produce a concise list, similar behaviours were combined (e.g. the various indicators \nused to assess whether trainee doctors required assistance). Finally, it should be noted \nthat the leadership behaviours in the framework are not weighted according to their \nprominence in the interviews, nor is the framework intended to be linear. \n \nINSERT TABLE 3 HERE \n \nTo be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team Leadership in the Intensive Care Unit: The Perspective of Specialists. Critical Care Medicine. \n 10 \nTeam development behaviours \nOf the 216 references to team development behaviours, 62% were made in relation to a  \nroutine day (interview phase 1), and 33% when discussing general leadership skills \n(phase 3). Over a third (41%) related to behaviours aimed at establishing team norms. \nVirtually no references (1%) were made to behaviours for \u2018providing organisational \nsupport\u2019 (e.g. designing official rewards systems), and this category was excluded from \nfurther analysis. Furthermore, over 70% of references to \u2018coaching\u2019 were also coded as \nbelonging to the functional leadership categories of \u2018planning and decision making\u2019 and \n\u2018managing team members\u2019 (e.g. teaching during the round). As \u2018coaching\u2019 behaviours \nwere described as integral to leading ICU teams, and were mostly captured within the \nanalysis of functional leadership behaviours, the category was excluded from further \nanalysis.  \n \nSenior physician\u2019 references to team development behaviours focussed on, but were not \nexclusive to, medical trainees. In analysing behaviours used to \u2018provide team direction\u2019, \ntwo sub-categories emerged. Senior physicians described i) demonstrating the clinical \nstandards expected of team members (e.g. taking responsibility for decision-making), and \nii) developing a shared perspective on the goals and vision for the unit (e.g. having senior \nphysicians cooperate on developing unit goals) that would withstand changes in \npersonnel. Similarly, two sub-categories emerged in the analysis of behaviours to \n\u2018establish team norms\u2019. Senior physicians described i) building expectations for \nteamwork that facilitated team members working well together (e.g. explaining team \nstructures, asking team members to co-ordinate on information sharing), and ii) building \nTo be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team Leadership in the Intensive Care Unit: The Perspective of Specialists. Critical Care Medicine. \n 11 \na positive and open relationship between team members and the senior physician (e.g. \nthrough encouraging novel ideas, not over-reacting to mistakes). \n \nTable 4 synthesises and lists the team development behaviours used by senior physicians \nto create conditions that will enable team performance. The procedure used to develop \nthe functional leadership behaviours (table 3) was replicated, albeit with two key \ndistinctions. Firstly, team development behaviours were not associated with a phase of \nwork within the ICU, and referred to general behaviours that are demonstrated during \npatient care or discussions with staff (e.g. establishing\/following treatment protocols), or \ndemonstrations of attitude (e.g. asking for opinions). Furthermore, the categories of \n\u2018providing team direction\u2019 and \u2018establishing team norms\u2019 were each broken down into the \ntwo emergent sub-categories described above.   \n \nINSERT TABLE 4 HERE \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nSenior physicians illustrated the importance of team leadership in the ICU. Team \nleadership was described as a complex set of functional and adaptive (according to \nscenario and team) behaviours, whereby senior physicians constantly attempted to i) \nunderstand and interpret challenges facing the ICU team (e.g. through patient reviews, \ndiscussing patient progression), ii) make and effectively communicate decisions on \npatient care (e.g. developing patient care plans), and iii) manage the activities and needs \nTo be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team Leadership in the Intensive Care Unit: The Perspective of Specialists. Critical Care Medicine. \n 12 \nof team members whilst prioritising patient safety (e.g. task delegation for developing \ntrainees, directive decision-making during crisis). Furthermore, a core function of the \nteam leader is to develop a stable and safe environment where a constantly changing \ngroup of team members can develop their skills and knowledge. Key to this are senior \nphysicians working to develop a common perspective (for team members) on the goals \nand expectations within the ICU, and by establishing a positive team culture (e.g. \nencouraging team members to understand their inter-dependencies, and to contribute to \npatient planning).  \n \nThe structured interviews found senior physicians to report using a variety of team \nleadership behaviours. The framework presented in tables 3 and 4 structures these data in \na manner that, i) reflects the established two dimensions of team leadership, ii) provides \nexample behaviours for the behavioural categories underlying each dimension, and iii) \nidentifies behaviours used to lead teams during specific phases of work. The framework \nshows leaders to constantly adapt their leadership strategies (34). During the \u2018unit \nassessment\u2019 phase, senior physicians guide team members in developing their \nunderstanding of patient conditions, and facilitate the team to develop patient treatment \nplans. During the \u2018monitoring phase\u2019, senior physicians provide a supportive function, \nwhereby they identify problems and assist team members in providing patient care. \nLastly, during \u2018crisis management\u2019 phases, team leaders tend to adopt a more directive \napproach to leadership, developing\/sharing crisis management plans and delegating tasks \nto team members. This framework is intended to provide insight into the team leadership \nbehaviours used by ICU team leaders. It could be used to contribute to the future \nTo be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team Leadership in the Intensive Care Unit: The Perspective of Specialists. Critical Care Medicine. \n 13 \ndevelopment of team leadership training and assessment tools for trainee physicians, and \nto provide a frame of reference for trainees developing leadership skills.  \n \nTo validate the leadership framework it is necessary to reflect on whether the behaviours \nidentified are likely to influence team or patient outcomes. Although leadership is \nimportant for safety in numerous domains, only limited behavioural research has been \nconducted in intensive care. However, research in other healthcare domains can provide \ninsights. For example, in surgery, anaesthesia, and neonatal care, team leader information \ngathering behaviours for collecting data from team members, cross-checking information, \nensuring team members comprehend patient data, and identifying team information gaps \nare important for performance (26, 35-39).  Similarly, team leader planning activities for \nestablishing patient plans and task priorities, encouraging participation in decision-\nmaking, communicating thresholds for contingency plan application, and systematically \nrecapping plans are also important (35, 36, 40-42). Furthermore, research with \nemergency medicine teams highlights the need for team leaders to delegate and tailor \ninstructions to team member skills, develop clear team roles\/structures, and delegate \nleadership duties to trainees when workloads are low (43-47). Leader monitoring \nbehaviours have also been identified as crucial for ensuring safety (48, 49). Research \nwith emergency teams has emphasised team leaders asserting their authority, providing \nincreased guidance for complex\/novel tasks, focussing on situation assessment when \narriving late, remaining calm, and delegating leadership authority as task load lessens \n(25, 48, 50, 51).  \n \nTo be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team Leadership in the Intensive Care Unit: The Perspective of Specialists. Critical Care Medicine. \n 14 \nIn terms of team leadership behaviours to develop an environment where team members \nperform effectively, the behaviours captured within the framework resonate with the \nmedical literature. For example, team leaders creating a culture of open communication, \nparticularly for listening to trainee and nurse concerns during decision-making is \nimportant for patient safety (11, 27, 52, 53). Furthermore, research in trauma and \nresuscitation units emphasises team leaders developing clear expectations for team \nmember behaviours, displaying a positive attitude, developing rationales for change, and \nsetting standards for teamwork through their own cooperative behaviours (43, 54, 55). In \naddition, research with trauma, surgical, and ICU teams has highlighted goal setting and \nthe development of a safe learning environment in which constructive feedback is \nprovided (48, 56-59). Although healthcare research has also identified leader behaviours \nnot captured in the framework (e.g. debriefing  (60)), the framework structures and \ndevelops the existing healthcare leadership literature, and identifies new team leadership \nbehaviours (e.g. senior physicians collaborating to avoid inconsistencies in instructions \non patient care and their behavioural expectations of staff). The interview data are also \nconsistent with psychology research differentiating between dimensions of team \nleadership (1, 21), alongside complementing adaptive leadership research (34, 47, 48). \nFinally, three of the team leadership behavioural categories (managing materials, \ncoaching, providing organisational support) were excluded from the analysis, potentially \nsignifying their lack of relevance to ICU team leadership..   \n \nThe sample was limited to senior physicians, with the interviews focussing on the \nbehaviours they report using to lead teams. In validating the framework, outcome data is \nTo be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team Leadership in the Intensive Care Unit: The Perspective of Specialists. Critical Care Medicine. \n 15 \nrequired alongside additional interviews with nurses and trainees (41). Future research \nwill compare ICU team member\u2019 perceptions of effective leadership skills, and will build \nupon informal follow-up interviews conducted with a small sample of senior trainee \nphysicians. These interviews provided similar and additional insights to those provided \nby ICU specialists. For example, senior trainees described themselves as the \u2018conduit\u2019 \nbetween the senior physicians and trainees and nurses (e.g. ensuring information is \nunderstood). They also highlighted challenges of having leadership rotated  between \nsenior physicians on a given day\/week, with trainees adapting their behaviours to meet \nthe perceived expectations of the lead ICU physician. \n \nSemi-structured interviews provide rich data, with interviewees describing behaviours \nand cognition in high detail, however they do have limitations. Although interviewees \nwere ICU experts, it is not possible to ascertain their leadership qualities. Critical incident \ninterviews attempt to overcome this limitation by having interviewees focus on \nsuccessful behaviours engaged during an event, rather than focussing on subjective \nopinions. However interviewees may have recalled behaviours inaccurately (61), and \nfocussed on the aspects of their behaviour they believed most important (irrespective of \ntheir actual effectiveness). The analysis attempted to reduce this limitation through \nfocussing on behaviours recalled by several interviewees, or by interpreting behaviours \nusing existing leadership research. It is also not possible to ascertain whether \ninterviewees did not focus on their own behaviours, but instead discussed behaviours \nthey expected to be important. The extent to which stated behavioural preferences and \nintentions (e.g. for prescribing behaviours) predict the actual behaviours of clinicians \nTo be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team Leadership in the Intensive Care Unit: The Perspective of Specialists. Critical Care Medicine. \n 16 \nvaries (62), and is considerably stronger when self-report measures (as opposed to \nobjective measures) of behaviour are used. Thus, interviewee actual behavioural \nengagement cannot be established, and recollections may be influenced by social \ndesirability (63) and hindsight biases (64).   \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nEffective team leadership is essential for ensuring team performance and patient safety. \nThrough applying team leadership theory and semi-structured interviews, a preliminary \nframework has been developed to capture the team leadership behaviours reportedly used \nby senior physicians to facilitate effective ICU team performance. Although the \nframework requires validation, it provides insight into the team leadership behaviours \nused by ICU team leaders, and can potentially contribute to the future design of ICU team \nleadership training and assessment tools, alongside providing trainee physicians a \nframework against which to develop their leadership skills. \nTo be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B.

\n\u2022 Trainee doctors are observed performing tricky procedures so to detect  \nindicators (e.g. stress, distraction, nurse unease) of a need to intervene; \n\u2022 Tasks which trainees have not previously performed, or are struggling \nto perform, are supervised or performed by the senior physician for \ndemonstration and skill retention purposes; \n\u2022 Team members co-ordination is assessed (e.g. task duplication, \ninformation sharing), and instructions given where necessary (e.g. re-\nconfirming tasks, priorities and inter-dependencies); \n    \n    \nCrisis \nManagement \n \nDeveloping crisis \nmanagement plans,  \nand providing directive \nleadership during \nemergency situations. \n \n\u2022 A concise analysis of the situation from the trainee doctors\/senior \nnurse is requested; \n\u2022 Where situation is managed by a trainee physician, indicators \nshowing need for senior physician intervention are monitored (e.g. \ntrainee indecision, severity of illness, management plan quality); \n\u2022 When performing tasks requiring high-levels of attention (e.g. line \ninsertion), team members instructed to verbally update on new \ninformation (e.g. physiological measures); \n\u2022 Information is considered \u2018aloud\u2019 in order to share and confirm (i.e. \nidentify inconsistencies) team member perspectives; \n\u2022 Future situational\/system information requirements are identified  \n(e.g. availability of surgical support); \n\u2022 A crisis management plan is quickly developed\/adapted with the \nsupport of team members, and situational overview is communicated; \n\u2022 As required, team members opinions are sought on the management \nplan, and alternative ideas considered if appropriate; \n\u2022 Task priorities and contingency plans are quickly communicated to the \nteam; \n\u2022 Team members are verbally updated on changes to the management \nplan as the situation progresses; \n\u2022 Team members not needed to provide support are tasked to focus on \nnormal patient care duties outlined within unit management plan;  \n \n\u2022 Decision-making authority assumed if trainee is not coping, or if patient \nsafety may be at risk (e.g. time constraints, illness complexity)   \n\u2022 Decision-making authority is asserted through clearly and appropriately  \ndelegating tasks (e.g. by seniority), and by giving precise instructions; \n\u2022 Calmness is shown in decision-making, and team members are \nencouraged to contribute information to the decision-making process; \n\u2022 Difficulties in team members performing technical tasks are anticipated, \nwith the senior physician being prepared to supervise or dynamically \nswap functions with trainees as necessary; \n\u2022 Should another team member or specialist be better suited to \nperforming a task than the senior physician, help is requested; \n\u2022 Team members are coordinated through them confirming their task \nduties, and providing constant updates on task progression;  \n\u2022 As control is gained of the situation, decision-making is distributed \nback to senior trainee and nursing staff; \nTo be published as: Reader, T., Flin, R., & Cuthbertson, B.
