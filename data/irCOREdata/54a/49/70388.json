In this vision, physical spaces are \nenhanced with computing capabilities to act more \nintelligently: they observe, interact with and react to \nhumans in meaningful ways. They understand human \nreasoning, analyze behaviors and infer intentions. \nFurthermore, intelligent environments actively \ncollaborate with their inhabitants to assist them in \nmaking their surroundings more pleasant. Intelligent \nenvironments even take decisions and execute \nactions on their own. They become integral \nparticipants in the daily human activity. \nA critical element that Weiser anticipated, yet has not \nbeen achieved, is the invisibility of pervasive \nsystems. The ability of such systems to disappear \ninto the background of everyday life is dependant on \ntheir ability to correctly interpret the state of the \nenvironment and to act accordingly: intelligent \nsystems that incorrectly interpret the state of the \nworld or the intentions of users are likely to take \ninappropriate actions that are not naturally anticipated \nby users [6]. Such incorrect actions could become \nvery disruptive and intrusive to users, they distract \nthe inhabitants of intelligent spaces from their \nongoing activity and therefore, they make them more \naware of the system. This paper begins to address \nthe challenge of designing less intrusive intelligent \nenvironments that can engage in richer and more \nmeaningful interactions with users. We believe that \nsuch systems must have a deep understanding of \nuser context and, specifically, should have an \nunderstanding of activities that a user is engaged in. \nOur approach is thus inspired by concepts from \nactivity theory [9] and requires support for three basic \nsystem functions: \n\u2022 Sensing context: By observing and monitoring \nusers\u2019 context, intelligent systems can collect \ninformation about the intelligent space and its \ninhabitants. \n\u2022 Analyzing context: By analyzing users\u2019 context, \nintelligent systems can estimate and interpret \nusers\u2019 activities. \n\u2022 Gracefully reacting to the inhabitants: By \nunderstanding users\u2019 activities, intelligent \nsystems can react unobtrusively to their \ninhabitants and therefore can potentially become \nmore invisible. \nIn this paper, we focus on one aspect of our system \ndesign, i.e. how to identify sensors that correlate with \nactivities in an intelligent space. First, we motivate \nour use of an activity-centric approach and justify the \nneed for precisely identifying correlations between \nsensors and activities. Second, we identify a number \nof desirable properties for activity-aware intelligent \nsystems. We then analyze different techniques for \nidentifying the correlations between sensors and \nactivities and show that statistical logistic regression \nhas the desired properties. Third, we describe in \ndetail our regression technique. Finally, we report \npreliminary results and state our conclusions. \nWHY AN ACTIVITY-CENTRIC APPROACH? \nIntelligent environments are inherently social and \ncollaborative spaces. Understanding the \u201cbehavioral-\nlevel\u201d interaction in such environments requires \nmodeling the context in which the inhabitants of the \nspace interact [6]. Early research [3,12] in intelligent \nenvironments focused on establishing simple \nrelationships between tangible context and \nappropriate actions, for example, switching on and off \ndevices based on user proximity. Intangible context \nsuch as activities, human moods and human \nintentions and complex relationships between sensor \ndata and actions have not received significant \nattention to date. However, to be invisible, intelligent \nsystems must understand both tangible and intangible \naspects of context and the complex relationships \nbetween sensors and actions. \nWe believe that the best method for capturing these \ncomplex relationships is using the notion of \n\u2018activities\u2019. Many earlier projects acknowledge a need \nfor such a capability. For example, MIT utilizes an \nactivity based approach in their second generation \niRoom [11]. EasyLiving [3] from Microsoft \nacknowledges the need for tracking activity in an \nintelligent environment. Responsive Offices [8] from \nXerox PARC identifies activity as an essential \ningredient for determining appropriate reactive \nbehaviors. Moreover, numerous studies in \npsychology [9] advocate that individual and group \nbehavior should be interpreted in relation to the \nactivities people participate in. Indeed, recent work on \ngroupware [2] has employed many of these concepts \n(in particular concepts from activity theory) for \nmodeling collaborative tasks. Such systems interpret \nbehaviors by considering the activity as the \nfundamental unit of analysis.  \nFigure 1 shows a high-level view of our activity \nanalysis system. Initially, sensors in the intelligent \nspace are correlated with activities that interest the \ninhabitants. The system uses empirical data \n(collected from the space) to derive causal \ncorrelations between activities and sensors. The \ncorrelations are then used to create a correlation \nmatrix that captures all the correlations between \nactivities and sensors in an intelligent space. \nSubsequently, the intelligent system can use the \nmatrix to interpret the activities in the intelligent \nspace, for example, a probabilistic reasoner can use \nthe matrix for building a Bayesian network to analyze \nthe activities. This might involve assessing the \nuncertainties in the reasoner\u2019s inferences or \nestablishing a dialogue with the inhabitants of the \nspace to disambiguate activities in situations of high \nuncertainty as proposed by [4,5]. \n \nV\nCOScreen\nCRT projector\nVideo\nSensing System\nCorrelation\nMatrix\nActivity\nUser\nPreferences\nDecision Making\nUncertainty\nCorrelation\nEmpirical Sensor\nData\nType of\nActivity\nConstruct\nMatrix\nIntelligent\nEnvironment System\nActivity Analyzer\nSystem-Human\nDialogue\nAmbiguity\nReasoning System\nBayesian\nReasoner\nFuzzy\nReasoner\nRule-Based\nReasoner\nAnalyze\nA ct ivi ty  1\nAct i vit y 3\nA cti vi ty 2\nS enso r 2\nS ens or  3\nS ensor  1\nS enso r 4\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n=\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n0100\n0010\n1101\n)(\n)(\n)(\n3\n2\n1\naRCV\naRCV\naRCV\n \nFigure 1, Activity-Aware Intelligent Space \nIt is important to emphasize that in a ubiquitous \nenvironment that is saturated with sensors, it is \nextremely important to distinguish the critical set of \nsensors that correlate with a specific activity from \nothers that do not. For example, imagine constructing \na Bayesian network for the activities in a ubiquitous \nspace without knowing the dependencies between \nsensor readings and the activities. Including \nuncorrelated sensors in the Bayesian network will \nresult in inaccuracies that can potentially misguide \nthe reasoner. Similarly, excluding correlated sensors \nfrom the Bayesian network could result in ignoring \nsome important aspects of the activities that can also \nmisguide the reasoner. This paper focuses on how to \ndetermine the critical set of sensors that correlate to \nactivities and proposes a new technique for \naccomplishing that. We begin our discussion by \nexamining some of the desirable properties for \nactivity-aware intelligent systems.  \nDESIRABLE PROPERTIES FOR ACTIVITY-AWARE \nINTELLIGENT SYSTEMS \nFew intelligent environments exist, and those that do \nare confined within research labs. Therefore, to \nidentify the desirable properties for activity-aware \nintelligent systems, we examined recent work on \nintelligent environments [3,12,13], studies from \npsychology on individual and group behavior [9], work \non natural and multimodal human-computer \ninteraction (HCI) [6,7] and connectionist and \nstatistical modeling techniques [5,10,12]. These \nefforts led us to the following desirable properties: \nTransparency and Comprehensibility \nIntelligent systems must support transparent activity \nmodeling. Transparent modeling enables intelligent \nenvironments to reason in ways that are \ncomprehensible to their inhabitants. Such a property \nis critical in order that it is possible to formulate \nprecisely how systems reached particular decisions. \nSubsequently, this information could be relayed to \ninhabitants of an intelligent space to support a \ndialogue with the system as proposed by [4,5] to fix \nany incorrect actions. \nAdaptability \nIntelligent systems must be adaptable to endure the \nhighly dynamic nature of ubiquitous environments. \nSuch adaptability must apply to both physical \nreconfiguration of spaces (e.g. changes in the \navailability of sensors) and to changes in activity \npatterns within these spaces. Different systems will \nrequire different forms of adaptability including off-\nline adaptability in which sensor data is logged for \nlater analysis and on-line adaptability in which sensor \ndata is examined and adaptation is performed while \nthe system is in use.   \nAccuracy \nClearly, achieving high accuracy in terms of \nidentifying the activity in an intelligent environment \nfrom a given set of sensor data is crucial. However, it \nshould be noted that the exact requirements in terms \nof accuracy are actually a property of the entire \nsystem and are influenced by the significance of the \nactions that will be triggered: users will perceive the \nactivity analysis process as accurate and indeed as \ninvisible when the system\u2019s reactions are correct. \nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the \nsystem has identified the users\u2019 activities correctly. \nFor example, imagine a user having a nap while \nwatching TV. An intelligent system might detect a \nreduction in the overall mobility in the space and \ntherefore infer that no one is in the room; resulting in \nswitching off the TV and the lights. Clearly, the \nanalysis process misdiagnosed the activity, but the \noutcome is still considered correct by the user. \nKnowledge Portability \nIt is important that knowledge about users and their \nactivity patterns can be moved between intelligent \nenvironments, reflecting user mobility inherent in the \nreal world. This will require a clear separation \nbetween the models that represent the system\u2019s \nknowledge about activities and the system-specific \nassumptions and mechanisms. In practice, achieving \nportability is likely to be extremely complex, raising \nmany technical challenges (e.g. determining the \nequivalence between sensors in different \nenvironments) and non-technical challenges in areas \nsuch as legal and social ethics (e.g. can models \nabout activity patterns be exchanged between private \nplaces and public places without violating the privacy \nof people?).  \nSo far, we have described 4 desirable properties for \nactivity-aware intelligent systems. It should be clear \nthat the above properties are not exhaustive, but we \nhave deliberately chosen them because of their \nimportance in the context of intelligent environments.  \nIt should also be noted that many of the properties \ndiscussed above are greatly exacerbated when \nmultiple people are participating in an activity.  \nTECHNIQUES FOR CORRELATING ACTIVITIES \nAND SENSORS \nSeveral techniques can be conceived for correlating \nactivities and sensors including: expert correlation, \nstatistical correlation and connectionist correlation. \nWe briefly describe these approaches and we \nanalyze their merits and demerits. \nExpert Correlation \nThe easiest way to correlate activities and sensors in \nan intelligent space is to use the opinion of an expert \nwho is familiar with the space. For example, in a \nsmart classroom, a teacher can identify different \nactivities that students participate in such as pop \nquiz, discussion, on-board problem solving exercise \netc. Subsequently, a rough mapping could be made \nbetween these activities and the available sensors in \nthe classroom. Gaia [13] uses this approach for \nactivity analysis where the inhabitants of the \nintelligent space identify the correlations and \nconstruct a belief network that models their activities. \nThis network is then used by a Bayesian reasoner to \nidentify the activities.  \nExpert correlation suffers from several limitations. \nFirstly, it does not scale well: as more activities and \nsensors are introduced it becomes harder for human \nexperts to assess the correlations. Secondly, people \nmight have different views about the degrees of \ncorrelations between sensors and activities. \nTherefore, relying on the subjective assessment of a \nparticular individual might lead to inaccuracies. \nThirdly, adapting the correlations to the dynamic \nnature of a ubiquitous space requires a human \nexpert: an undesirable proposition especially when \nintelligent spaces host rapidly changing activities. \nHence, we believe that expert correlation is of limited \nuse in ubiquitous environments that are heavily \nsaturated with sensors. \nConnectionist and Statistical Correlation \nAlternatively, connectionist or statistical techniques \ncan be used to identify correlations between sensors \nand activities. Connectionist correlation relies on \nneural network analysis that identifies patterns \nbetween different inputs. This approach has been \nused in the neural house project [12] where a neural \nnetwork observes the lifestyle of the inhabitants of a \nhouse and programs itself accordingly. Similarly, \nstatistical techniques such as regression can identify \npotential causal relationships between different \nvariables. In ubiquitous environments, these two \ntechniques can certainly handle large amounts of \ndata that human experts find cumbersome. Several \nresearch studies [5,12] have affirmed that neural \ntechniques are more accurate than regression \ntechniques owing to their ability to capture non-linear \ncorrelations automatically. However, they suffer from \nthe incomprehensibility of the decision making \nprocess, i.e. it is very hard to reconstruct the rationale \nof a neural network of why a particular correlation \nbetween a sensor and an activity is strong. In \ncontrast, statistical techniques are based upon \u201cwell \nunderstood models of behavior\u201d and therefore, it is \nusually easier to reconstruct the rationale behind their \ndecision making process [5]. Moreover, adapting \nneural networks to the continuous changes in an \nintelligent space might often require retraining the \nwhole network which can be an expensive process \nespecially in cases that require on-line adaptation. \nAnalysis \nIn light of the above discussion, we can see that \nexpert correlation is not a viable solution due to its \nvulnerability to inaccuracies and its inability to deal \nwith the abundance of sensor information in \nubiquitous environments. In contrast, regression and \nneural networks can deal with the richness of sensor \ninformation in such environments. However, \nregression provides a more comprehensible \nframework than neural based techniques thereby \nmaking it more suitable for supporting transparent \nmodeling where users can establish a dialogue with \nthe system. Moreover, reapplying regression to adapt \nto the dynamic nature of a ubiquitous space is likely \nto incur less overhead than retraining a neural \nnetwork. Finally, it should be noted that although \nregression is less accurate than neural techniques, its \noutcome is still comparable [5]. \nHowever, it would be unfair to give the impression \nthat neural analysis is unusable, while regression is \ncompletely without problems. The major conceptual \nlimitation in regression is that it can never identify the \nunderlying causal mechanism. For example, one \nwould find a strong positive correlation between the \nnumber of users attached to a particular access point \nin a conference hall and the presentation activities \ntaking place. Do we conclude that a presentation \nactivity causes an increase in the number of users \nattached to an access point? Even though that might \nbe the case in this simple example, in many other \ncases, the causal explanations might not be obvious. \nMoreover, as the number of variables increase, more \nempirical observations are required to avoid having \nsignificant correlations while in fact one or more \nvariables are capitalizing on chance. Finally, even \nthough the rationale behind correlations is potentially \neasier to reconstruct using regression, it is unclear \nhow easy it is to relay that information to regular \ninhabitants of an intelligent space that have no prior \nknowledge of statistics. Undoubtedly, friendly means \nshould be developed to enable such system-user \ndialogues.  We acknowledge these problems and \nrecognize the need for exploring them further. \nMULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION \nMultinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) [10] is a \nstatistical technique that investigates and models \nrelationships between a dependent variable and one \nor more independent variables. It is typically used \nwhen a dependent variable has the following \nproperties: \n\u2022 Categorical: The dependent has a limited set of \nvalues (e.g. for an activity {presentation=0, \nbreak=1, lunch=2}) that could be ordinal (e.g. \n{strongly agree, agree, disagree}) or non-ordinal. \n\u2022 Mutually Exclusive: Any instance of a dependent \ncannot be classified as belonging to more than \none category. For example, considering an \nactivity as a dependant, an instance of an activity \ncannot be a presentation and a break at the same \ntime. \n\u2022 Polychotomous: The dependent can have 2 or \nmore categories. A special case of MLR is the \nbinomial logistic regression that deals with the \ndependent when it is a dichotomy. \nMLR can deal with independents of any type (e.g. \ncontinuous, discrete, dichotomous, polychotomous \netc.). Generally speaking, MLR has less stringent \nrequirements than conventional regression \ntechniques including: \n1- It does not assume linearity of relationship \nbetween the independent variables and the \ndependent. \n2- It does not require normally distributed variables. \n3- It does not assume homoscedasticity (i.e. the \nvariance around the regression fit is the same). \nDetails of logistic regression techniques can be found \nin [10], below we explain only those aspects critical to \nour discussion. In particular, we explain how to \nassess the adequacy of a logistic regression. \nLogistic 2R  \nThe logistic 2R  measures the strength of the \nassociation between the dependent variable and the \nindependents. It should be noted that the logistic 2R  \nis different from the 2R  in conventional regression. \nThe latter measures the goodness of fit relying on the \nvariance around the regression fit. However, the \nvariance of categorical dependent variables depends \non the frequency distribution of that variable and \ntherefore logistic 2R  just reflects the strength of the \nassociation. \nClassification Percentage \nThe classification percentage reflects how good a \nlogistic regression formula is in estimating the correct \ncategories of a dependant. In a perfect model, the \nestimated values are the exact actual values making \nthe overall classification percentage 100%. It should \nbe noted that the classification process relies on a \nprobability cutoff where higher cutoffs mean more \nsensitivity in the classification process.  \nModel Chi-Square Test \nIt is very important to determine the effect of each \nindependent in the logistic formula. For example, the \nformula might show better correlation without some \nindependents or with some additional independents. \nModel Chi-Square is a technique that measures the \nimprovement in a fit that an independent variable \nmakes compared to the null model (i.e. model without \nindependents). This technique uses the null \nhypothesis to test for individual significance. The null \nhypothesis says that an independent variable \ncoefficient has no effect on the dependent variable. \nTherefore, rejecting the hypothesis means that the \nindependent should not be deleted from the formula \nbecause it has a significant contribution. While \naccepting the null hypothesis means that the \nindependent variable is insignificant and therefore \nshould be deleted.  Generally speaking, when the \nprobability of the Model Chi-Square is less than 0.05, \nthe null hypothesis is rejected. \nSo far, we have described some important concepts \nfor our following discussion.  Next, we describe how \nto use logistic regression for identifying the \ncorrelations in an intelligent environment.  \nCORRELATION IN INTELLIGENT \nENVIRONMENTS \nIn the context of intelligent environments, we are \nusing MLR for identifying the critical set of sensors \nthat highly correlate with activities in an intelligent \nspace. Sensor data is collected for some period of \ntime while users are required to record their activities. \nThe system records this information along with \nstatistical data from all sensors. The collected data is \nthen analyzed by a logistic regression engine to \nidentify the sensors that are showing high correlation \nwith the activities. The output of the regression \nengine takes the form of a correlation vector. \nDefinition \nIn an activity-aware environment with the following \nproperties: \n\u2022 A is a set of n+1 activities defined by \n}{},...,,{ 21 \u03d5aaaa n \u222a  where \u03d5a  denotes the \nunrecognized activity, and \n\u2022 S is a set of k sensors in the intelligent space defined \nby },...,,{ 21 ksss , \na Correlation Vector (CV) identifies the critical set of \nsensors that highly correlate with 1 or more activities (and \nis thus influential in identifying the activities). A CV has the \nfollowing form: \nkiandc\nandAAwherecccACV\ni\nk\n\u2264\u2264\u2208\n\u2282\u2032>=<\u2032\n1}1,0{\n,...,,)( 21  \nwhere ic  reflects the correlation between the activities \nbelonging to A\u2032  and sensor is  such that: 0=ic  \nindicates no or insignificant correlation and 1=ic  \nindicates significant correlation. \n \nFor example, in a space with three sensors \n{ sensoretemperaturs =1 , sensorprojectors =2 , \nsensorcountpeoples =3 }, a correlation vector for a \npresentation activity might look as follows: \n>=<=\u2032 1,1,0}){( onpresentatiACV  \nThis indicates that a presentation activity is highly \ncorrelated with the projector sensor and the people \ncount sensor but not with the temperature sensor.  \nSensor Selection and the Correlation Matrix \nOur current regression engine relies on the Chi-\nSquare test and the classification percentage to \ndetermine the CV. We can configure the engine to \nselect the highly correlated sensors in one of two \nways: \na. Forward Selection: In this procedure, the best \nsensor is found. Next, the sensor that adds the \nmost to the logistic fit is included. This process \ncontinues until specific cutoff thresholds (in the \nChi-Square and in the classification percentage) \nare reached or none of the sensors add a \nsignificant value to the strength of the \nassociation. \nb. Backward Selection: In this procedure, all the \nsensors are initially included in the logistic model. \nSubsequently, sensors are deleted from the \nmodel based on their level of significance. Again, \nthis process continues until all the sensors left are \nat a specific significance level. \nIt should be noted that higher cutoff values reduce \nthe number of sensors that correlate with particular \nactivities. This potentially simplifies the reasoner\u2019s \nlogic, for example, a rule-based reasoner that relies \non a small set of sensors is likely to generate simpler \nrules than reasoners that account for a big set of \nsensors. \nFurthermore, sensor selection is directly influenced \nby the number of categories of the dependent. When \nthe logistic engine is given some empirical data, it \ntries to account for all the categories of the \ndependent using one single logistic formula. For \nexample, imagine a space with the configuration \nshown in figure 2 where the links between sensors \nand activities indicate the presence of a correlation.  \n2s 3s\n1a 2a 3a\n1s 4s 5s\n \nFigure 2, Example Intelligent Environment \nAnalyzing empirical readings from the above space, \nthe logistic regression engine produces the following \nCV: \n>=<=\u2032 0,1,1,1,1}),,{( 321 aaaACV  \nObviously, the CV fails to reflect the exact \ndependencies shown in figure 2. This can potentially \nresult in inaccuracies when disambiguating activities. \nFor example, suppose an intelligent system wants to \ndisambiguate two particular activities },{ 21 aa , \nrelying on the above CV includes 4s  which is \nuncorrelated to the two activities. Clearly, this can \npotentially misguide the reasoner. To resolve this \nissue, we use binomial logistic regression to identify \nthe CV of sensors for each activity with respect to \u03c6a  \n(i.e. the no activity state). We give the resulting CV a \nspecial name: the Reference Correlation Vector \n(RCV). In the example shown in figure 2, the RCVs \nare: \n>=<=\u2032=\n>=<==\n>=<=\u2032=\n0,1,0,0,0}),{()(\n0,0,1,1,0}),{'()(\n0,0,0,1,1}),{()(\n33\n22\n11\n\u03c6\n\u03d5\n\u03c6\naaACVaRCV\naaACVaRCV\naaACVaRCV\n \nNotice that the RCVs precisely reflect the \ndependencies shown in figure 2. More importantly, \nthe disjunction of RCVs is the CV for the union of \ntheir activities. For example, the disjunction of the \nabove 3 equations is the correlation vector for all the \nactivities shown in figure 2: \n}),,{(\n0,1,1,1,1\n0,1,0,0,00,0,1,1,00,0,0,1,1\n)()()(\n321\n321\naaaACV\naRCVaRCVaRCV\n=\u2032=\n>=<\n><\u2228><\u2228>=<\n\u2228\u2228\n \nFurthermore, combining RCVs of all activities is \nsimply a matrix that represents all the critical \ncorrelations in an intelligent environment. We call this \na correlation matrix. The following equation shows the \ngeneral form of this matrix: \nnjandkiandcandSkandAnwhere\nccc\nccc\nccc\naRCV\naRCV\naRCV\ni\nj\nk\nnnn\nk\nk\nn\n\u2264\u2264\u2264\u2264\u2208=\u2212=\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n=\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n11}1,0{||)1|(|\n)(\n)(\n)(\n21\n2\n2\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n1\n1\n2\n1\nL\nMMMM\nL\nL\nM\n \nThe above matrix can also be represented as a \nsimple correlation graph. Figure 3 shows an example \nof a graph that correlates 4 sensors with 3 activities. \nFinally, we note that a correlation matrix does not \nreflect the exact degree of correlation between a \nparticular activity and its sensors. However, the \ndegree of correlation can be roughly estimated using \nthe reduction in the logistic 2R  of the model as a \nresult of omitting the term of a particular sensor from \nthe regression formula. We further elaborate on this \nparticular issue in the results section. \nActivity 1\nActivity 3\nActivity 2\nSensor 2\nSensor 3\nSensor 1\nSensor 4\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n=\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n0100\n0010\n1101\n)(\n)(\n)(\n3\n2\n1\naRCV\naRCV\naRCV\n \nFigure 3, Correlation Matrix and Correlation Graph \nUsing the Correlation Matrix \nReferring back to our discussion about an activity-\ncentric approach, we highlighted the need to identify \nthe activities in an intelligent space. We explained \nthat the abundance of sensors in ubicomp \nenvironments complicates activity analysis: including \nuncorrelated sensors or excluding correlated sensors \nfrom the decision making process can potentially \nmislead any reasoner. The correlation matrix \n(described above) serves as a filter that reflects the \nstrong dependencies between activities and sensors \nin an intelligent space. Reasoners that use the \ncorrelation matrix will deal with a reduced set of \nsensors that are highly correlated with the activities \nthey are trying to recognize. Clearly, this simplifies \nthe task of a reasoner. \nIn situations of high uncertainty, intelligent systems \nfail to identify the activities with reasonable \nconfidence. The logistic engine can be used with \nhigher cutoff values to determine the sensors that \nshow the highest correlation and therefore could be \nconsidered more reliable. These sensors can then be \nused to identify the activities. Moreover, when \nsensors are removed from the space, their values are \nreplaced with zeros in the matrix. Depending on the \naccuracy of the classification process and the weight \nof the removed sensors, the system might decide to \ninclude one or more correlated sensors to \ncompensate for the removed sensors. Similarly, when \nsensors are added to the space, the system gathers \nempirical data from the new sensors. Subsequently, \nactivities that are frequently misclassified can be \nreexamined with the new sensors included for \npotentially improving the classification process. \nPRELIMINARY RESULTS \nIn this section, we describe preliminary results of our \napproach. We use publicly available traces recorded \nover three days at the ACM SIGCOMM\u201901 \nconference (held at U.C. San Diego in August 2001) \nto demonstrate that logistic regression is effective in \ncorrelating sensors with activities. A detailed \ndescription of these traces can be found in [1]. The \ntraces record data samples from wireless access \npoints serving the conference. Note that due to the \nlack of availability of information on the no activity \nstate ( \u03c6a ), we are unable to calculate the RCV and \ntherefore we present measurements based on \nanalysis of the CV. \nTwo important pieces of information can be identified: \nthe number of mobile nodes attached to a particular \naccess point and the load on each access point. \nThese two quantities will serve as sensors for our \nexperiment. In addition, two different activities can be \nidentified including: sessions and breaks. Intuitively, \nwe would expect a correlation between these sensors \nand the activities. For example, during breaks the \nload over an access point is likely to drop and \ntherefore the load sensor will show a negative \ncorrelation with breaks.  Our experiments used 100 \nsample readings from one day to identify the logistic \nregression formula. We also performed 3 \nexperiments to classify 100 activities using the \nregression formula with the throughput sensor only, \nthe number of nodes sensor only and both sensors.  \nThroughput and Activities  \n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\nProp Group Correct vs Cutoff\nCutoff\nPr\nop\nor\ntio\nn \nG\nro\nup\n C\nor\nre\nct\nactivity\nBreak\nSession\n \nFigure 4, Proportion of Correct Classifications Vs. Cutoff \n(using Throughput) \nFirst, we characterize the strength of the correlation \nbetween the throughput at the access point and the \nactivities in the conference hall. Figure 4 shows the \nproportion of the correctly classified activities using \nthe regression formula for different cutoffs. From the \nfigure, we see that throughput sensor can indeed \nclassify all the activities correctly when the cutoff is \nvery low (i.e. we accept classifications with a broad \nerror margin). However, its accuracy decreases \nrapidly as the cutoff is increased (i.e. demanding less \ndeviation from the categories). With a 0.5 cutoff the \nregression formula classifies 83% of our test cases \ncorrectly. \nWe also found that the logistic 2R  for the regression \nformula is equal to 0.55. This reflects a moderate \nassociation between the throughput and the activities.  \nNumber of Nodes and Activities  \nOur second experiment characterizes the strength of \nthe correlation between the number of nodes \nattached to the access point and the activities in the \nconference hall. Figure 5 shows the proportion of the \ncorrectly classified activities using the regression \nformula for different cutoffs. From the figure, we see \nthat the number of nodes sensor can also classify all \nthe activities correctly for low cutoffs. However, the \nsensor is more robust to higher cutoffs than the \nthroughput sensor. In other words, its accuracy \ndecreases more slowly than that in the throughput \ncase as the cutoff increases. With a 0.5 cutoff the \nregression formula classifies 92% of our test cases \ncorrectly.  \n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\nProp Group Correct vs Cutoff\nCutoff\nP\nro\npo\nrti\non\n G\nro\nup\n C\nor\nre\nct\nactivity\nBreak\nSession\n \nFigure 5, Proportion of Correct Classifications Vs.

Cutoff \n(using Number of Users and Throughput) \nFinally, our third experiment characterizes the \nstrength of the correlation between both the number \nof nodes and their throughput, and the activities in the \nconference hall. Figure 6 shows the proportion of the \ncorrectly classified activities using the regression \nformula for different cutoffs. From the figure, we see \nthat the regression formula can still classify all the \nactivities correctly with low cutoffs. However, the \nclassification percentage does not seem to improve \nfrom the one that uses the number of nodes only. \nWith a 0.5 cutoff the regression formula classifies \n92% of our test cases correctly.  \nWe also found that the logistic 2R   for the regression \nformula is equal to 0.80. This means that the strength \nof the association between the number of nodes and \nthe throughput, and the activities is significant.  \nSensor Selection and the Correlation Matrix \nWhen the logistic regression engine performed \nforward and backward selection on the (throughput \nand number of nodes) regression, it omitted the \nthroughput in both cases. First, the engine measured \nthe reduction in  2R  when omitting the throughput \nterm. This reduced the strength of the association by \n0.00172. Second, the engine measured the reduction \nin 2R  when omitting the number of nodes term. This \nresulted in a reduction of 0.24. Clearly, including the \nthroughput sensor does not improve the strength of \nthe association between the activities and the \nindependents. Moreover, including the throughput has \nnot improved the classification percentage beyond \n92%. Therefore, the regression engine omitted the \nthroughput from the correlation matrix: \nthroughputs\nersnumberOfUsswhere\nsessionRCV\nbreakRCV\n=\n=\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n=\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n2\n101\n01\n)(\n)(  \nFinally, we note that the reduction in 2R  can be used \nas a rough estimate for the weights of sensors. \nDISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK \nIn this paper, we have highlighted the importance of \ncorrelating sensors with activities in an intelligent \nspace. Our approach uses logistic regression. We \ndescribed some desirable properties for activity-\naware environments including: transparency and \ncomprehensibility, adaptability, accuracy and \nknowledge portability. In light of these properties, we \nanalyzed several techniques for correlating activities \nwith sensors including: expert correlation, regression \ncorrelation and connectionist correlation. We \nconcluded that regression provides a more \ncomprehensible framework for correlating activities \nthan the other approaches. We then described in \ndetail our logistic regression approach. Finally, we \nreported preliminary results. \nOur plan for future work is to assess our approach in \nthe intelligent environment in our research lab. We \nare currently developing software components for \nhardware and software sensors to use them for \ncollecting empirical data. We are also working on \nbuilding a probabilistic reasoning system that will use \nour correlation matrix to identify activities in the \nintelligent space. In addition, we are developing \ntechniques for exporting and importing contextual \nknowledge across intelligent environments to allow \nspaces to identify unfamiliar activities using imported \nknowledge from other spaces. Finally, we intend to \ndeploy all these components in our research lab and \nto make our system accessible to a user community \nthat can report on the impact of our system on user \nperceptions of activity analysis. \nREFERENCES \n1.
