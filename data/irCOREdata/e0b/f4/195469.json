The mapping of the \nHuman Genome, among other developments associated with the \u2017new genetics\u2018, has precipitated \na rapid increase in knowledge about genetic causation in illness and disability, while the public is \nincreasingly informed about such developments and their potential relevance to health.  There are \nimplications too for the organisation of health services.  The traditional role of clinical genetics as \nan esoteric speciality concerned with rare conditions primarily caused by single-gene disorders is \nbeing supplemented by a growing awareness of the relevance of genetics to a wide range of \ncommon illnesses, so that health service professionals across clinical disciplines and within \nprimary care can draw on knowledge of genetic causation to treat patients appropriately, offer \ninformed advice and refer as necessary. \nThis is the final draft, after peer-review, of a manuscript published in Journal of Health Services \nResearch & Policy. The definitive version, detailed above, is available online at www.rsmjournals.com. \n\u00a9 2009 Royal Society of Medicine Press Limited \n2 \nIn England, concerns of these kinds gave rise in 2003 to a White Paper on future genetics \nprovision, Our Inheritance, Our Future.1  The White Paper heralded plans to assist the \n\u2017mainstreaming\u2018 of genetics knowledge and services throughout the National Health Service \n(NHS), \u2015assisting genetics to permeate all branches of medicine by supporting new initiatives in \ngenetics based care in key disease areas, in secondary and primary care,\u2016 and \u2015helping to \nempower frontline staff and commissioners in the NHS through investment in education and \ntraining.\u20161  Such developments were seen as a necessary response to the expansion in genetics \nknowledge and the growth in clinical applications that would follow to divide work appropriately \naccording to skill mix across primary, secondary and tertiary care.  \u2015Over time, as the relevance of \ngenetics across the spectrum of other medical specialities becomes apparent, mainstream NHS \nservices will be able to take advantage of new genetic tools in diagnosing, preventing and treating \ndisease.\u20161  The White Paper announced around \u00a38 million of funding for a programme of pilot \nservices to put into practice these \u2017mainstreaming\u2018 ambitions. \nCollaborative working across the sectors, organisations and professional groups of health \nservice bureaucracies, however, is not a straightforward enterprise.  Previous research has noted \nhow different work cultures may combine with the divisive effects of structural boundaries to \nnegate efforts to promote collaboration.2,3,4  Notable, for example, is how markets and quasi-\nmarkets may encourage clinicians to view each other more as competitors than collaborators, \nwhilst driving a wedge between purchasers and providers.  Similarly, the centrally-driven \nperformance management of a health care bureaucracy such as the English NHS, deploying \ntargets to drive change in clinicians\u2018 and managers\u2018 behaviour, may encourage practitioners to \nfocus on core work rather than look outward towards joining their provision with other sectors, \nspecialities or organisations within and beyond the Health Service.4  Such difficulties have \naffected other recent efforts in the UK to promote joined up working between hospitals and \nprimary care (and other agencies, such as social services), for example, in the case of delayed \ndischarges of older people5 and chronic disease management.6  In relation to genetics, specifically, \nthere are particular barriers to the spread of knowledge and practice to primary care, such as low \nskills and lack of interest among practitioners,7,8 and scepticism about value for patients,9 in the \nUK and elsewhere. \nThis article presents findings from an evaluation involving qualitative, comparative case-\nstudy research which accompanied the pilot programme following the genetics White Paper.  It \nfocuses on the challenges faced by pilots in bridging the divide between community-based \nservices and traditional hospital-based provision, and the ways in which they dealt with these.   \nThe programme of pilots consisted of four streams and 32 pilot sites, and was funded by \nthe English Department of Health (DH).  One stream, comprising five sites, involved piloting a \nmethod of identifying relatives of those diagnosed with a common inherited disorder, familial \nhypercholesterolaemia.10  A second stream of 10 sites involved service development projects \nwhich incorporated genetics into provision in other clinical fields in secondary and primary care.  \nThirdly, seven pilots, co-funded with Macmillan Cancer Support, implemented a new care \npathway for people at possible risk of inherited cancer, across primary, secondary and tertiary \ncare.11  Finally, 10 general practitioner (GP) with a special interest (GPSI) in genetics pilots were \nfunded to enable these GPs to provide education and leadership around genetics, alongside \nclinical services in most cases, within primary care.  While most pilots were led by hospital-based \nstaff in secondary or tertiary care, some\u2014notably the GPSI initiatives, but also a few in other \nstreams\u2014were hosted by Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) and led by primary care practitioners. \nMethods \nThe DH-commissioned evaluation involved the selection of 11 case-study sites from the service \ndevelopment, cancer genetics and GPSI streams for comparative analysis.12  These cases were \ntheoretically sampled to ensure variation in characteristics such as clinical field, host organisation \nThis is the final draft, after peer-review, of a manuscript published in Journal of Health Services \nResearch & Policy. The definitive version, detailed above, is available online at www.rsmjournals.com. \n\u00a9 2009 Royal Society of Medicine Press Limited \n3 \n(PCT, \u2017mainstream\u2018 clinical department in a hospital, or specialist genetics centre) and profession \nof pilot lead (clinical geneticist, other medical specialist, GP, nurse or manager) (see Table 1).  \nThe research involved a combination of qualitative methods, including in-depth interviews with \nstakeholders (project leads and staff, steering-group members, clinicians and managers in other \norganisations relating to the projects, commissioners and involved service users), observation at \npilot- and programme-level meetings, and analysis of bid documents, meeting notes, local \nevaluation reports and other relevant documents.  Interviews were semi-structured, focusing on \nquestions about organisational set-up, relationships with key stakeholders, leadership, knowledge \nmanagement, policy drivers, service-user involvement and sustainability, but allowing for \ndeviation from these topics according to the role and knowledge of interviewees.  Towards the \nend of the pilot period, follow-up interviews were conducted with leads in each site, to review \nprogress towards aims and reflect on challenges faced. \nAcross the cases and including some respondents responsible for the programme as a \nwhole, 125 interviews were conducted.  Along with notes from observational work and \ndocumentary evidence, these were analysed iteratively, on a case-by-case basis, with at least two \nauthors in each case rereading and coding transcripts, notes and documents, generating themes, \nand cross-checking these in discussion with each other.  The topics addressed in the interview \nschedule provided a preliminary coding framework and this was supplemented in the course of \nanalysis by other themes identified by the authors.  Transcripts and documents were coded \naccordingly, and excerpts from each source were grouped thematically and analysed, to permit \ncross-case as well as within-case analysis.  As a means of authenticating the analysis, findings were \npresented to the commissioners of, and some participants in, the research, providing a check on \nthe validity of analysis. \nResults \nEngaging primary care in genetics issues \nFor pilots based in hospitals and primary care alike, there were some common challenges in \ngaining the engagement of GPs, nurses and other primary care practitioners in their new services.  \nIn general terms, there was notable reluctance among such practitioners to concern themselves \nwith questions of genetics, given other more pressing priorities.  Genetics was seen by many \nprimary care practitioners as of little relevance to the vast majority of their patients.  One GP in \nSite 6 referred to cancer genetics provision as \u2015a bit of a Cinderella-type service: if it was available \nyou might use it, but if it wasn\u2018t then as a GP you weren\u2018t too concerned.\u2016  This resulted in \nsevere difficulties for pilot staff in accessing general practice-based professionals to provide \ninformation and education on the new services they were setting up.  Practice managers acted \neffectively as \u2017gatekeepers\u2018 to GPs; GPs themselves were in some cases fiercely protective of their \npractice nurses\u2018 time: \n\u2015Some practices have regular meetings and all members of the team work closely together \nand everyone is involved, and then you will get another practice down the road who never \nhave a practice meeting. [\u2026] Practice nurses are probably the ideal person [to identify and \nrefer patients to the pilot] but they are employed by their practice and some of the GP \npractices are very \u2017No, my practice nurse does this, this, and this if they are on my must-do \nlist, she hasn\u2018t got time to spend three hours with you on education\u2018, and that\u2018s really \ndifficult.\u2016 (Pilot nurse, Site 6) \nSome respondents attributed these differences to age of GPs, arguing that the more recently \ngraduated would have greater understanding of the relevance of genetics to their day-to-day \npractice; for others, it seemed more a matter of differences of organisational culture between \npractices. \nPilot staff developed various strategies for \u2015getting into the GP world,\u2016 as a nurse in Site 2 \nput it.  Pilots that counted GPs among their staff found themselves at an advantage in this regard, \nThis is the final draft, after peer-review, of a manuscript published in Journal of Health Services \nResearch & Policy. The definitive version, detailed above, is available online at www.rsmjournals.com. \n\u00a9 2009 Royal Society of Medicine Press Limited \n4 \nbuilding on existing relationships with other local GPs.  Conversely, respondents from nurse-led \npilots sensed that some GPs were less willing to refer to their services, and indeed a surgeon in \nSite 7 noted that certain GPs continued to refer patients with suspected family histories of cancer \ndirectly to him rather than through the unitary care pathway instituted by the nurse-led pilot and \nsupported by the PCT.  However, over time, pilots did generally find ways of building trust \namong GPs, who were important not only as referrers, but also for their influence on future \ncommissioning decisions.  Well known practitioners within the pilots, or supporters within the \nPCT, sometimes brought the necessary social capital to encourage GPs and others to engage.  \nPersistence often eventually resulted in access to GP practices, though GPs\u2018 engagement often \ncame at a cost\u2014\u2015money or a free lunch,\u2016 as a pilot nurse in Site 4 wryly commented\u2014reflecting \nthe lack of intrinsic interest in genetic matters (the cause of which is considered in the next \nsection).  Service-development projects based in secondary care found that extensive publicity \nand persistent contact with GPs was the only way to improve knowledge of provision that had \nbeen previously somewhat remote from day-to-day primary-care practice, and commissioned at a \nregional specialised level, rather than locally. \nThe reluctance of primary care practitioners to engage with genetics was not just \nattributable to lack of interest.  Centrally mandated priorities and changes inevitably commanded \nPCTs\u2018 attentions, and genetics seemed a comparatively low priority.  GPSIs faced a succession of \ndifferent managers (four in the case of Site 9\u2018s GPSI) as PCTs contended with the demands of \ncentral government and the reconfiguration of their boundaries.  Meanwhile, the introduction of \nthe new GP contract concentrated GPs\u2018 minds on areas covered by the Quality and Outcomes \nFramework (QOF), which did not include genetics. \nIn some cases, it was possible to emphasise alignments between pilots\u2018 work and centrally \ndetermined priorities, playing up points of confluence which PCTs were otherwise happy to \nignore: \n\u2015I don\u2018t think [genetics] is that decoupled from things like the NSF [National Service \nFramework]; I just think that people haven\u2018t really picked up on that. [\u2026] PCTs have not \nparticularly picked up on them because until [laughs] they\u2018re forced to take notice, they\u2018ve \nprobably got enough things on their plate.\u2016 (Clinical geneticist, Site 3) \nThe solution, then, was \u2015to be more creative in how we sell it to the PCTs,\u2016 as a nurse in the \nsame pilot put it.  Such alignments were not so evident for all projects, however, and some had to \nrely on the agency of patients themselves to drive primary care practitioners to engage with \ngenetic issues and make referrals to the new services.  The clinical geneticist in Site 1 observed \nthat: \n\u2015patients with [this condition] certainly are far more informed and they are definitely \ntripping up far more frequently to their own doctors and saying, \u2017I want to be referred\u2018. \n[\u2026] I love pushy patients. They don\u2018t bother me, because all of our patients are pushy: \nthat\u2018s why they get to see us.\u2016 \nThe onset of the condition in question, though, tended to take place in early to mid-adulthood, \nand respondents elsewhere noted that gaining public engagement was not always so \nstraightforward, especially in socio-economically deprived areas. \nThe place of genetics within primary care practice \nFor the kinds of reasons noted above, many hospital-based practitioners felt that provision \nneeded to be primary care-led.  As a genetic counsellor in Site 6 put it, \u2015if we go out to people, \nthey just switch off: they\u2018re not interested in genetics, they have a lot else going on. [\u2026] It has to \ncome from primary care.\u2016  However, a number of connected features of primary care practice \nmilitated against efforts to foster this kind of involvement. \nFor a start, most GPs and other primary care practitioners had limited contact with \ngenetics services.  As several GPs pointed out, most direct referrals to clinical genetics \ndepartments would be for children with unknown conditions, where genetics was seen to have a \nThis is the final draft, after peer-review, of a manuscript published in Journal of Health Services \nResearch & Policy. The definitive version, detailed above, is available online at www.rsmjournals.com. \n\u00a9 2009 Royal Society of Medicine Press Limited \n5 \nclear role in diagnosis, and in informing parents\u2018 pre-conceptual decision-making.  Most adults \nwith conditions that might have a genetic component would be referred to \u2017mainstream\u2018 clinical \nspecialists in secondary care, and so direct contact between primary care and clinical genetics \ninvolving these cases was limited.  Consequently, in relation to non-paediatric cases, in particular, \ndetailed knowledge of genetics was not seen as directly relevant to primary care practice for the \nlarge majority of patients: \n\u2015You can only hold so much knowledge in your brain, and you have to prioritise the \nknowledge which (a) you are likely to come across or (b) where if you come across \nsomething very rare, the consequences are very great. [\u2026] [Those who] think the GP \nshould know more about genetics [\u2026] don\u2018t understand the breadth of the workload, the \ntopics with which we work.\u2016 (GP, Site 2) \nLack of knowledge about genetics and lack of perceived relevance to day-to-day practice \nreinforced each other.9,13 Consequently, for many primary care practitioners, the most appropriate \nsolution, befitting the perceived level of need for extra genetics knowledge in primary care, was a \nrational division of labour that would see the development of specialist individuals or teams \nwithin primary care, which other primary care practitioners could draw on as necessary without \ndeveloping genetics knowledge themselves. \nThis, indeed, was the model pursued by many of the funded projects, which involved \nprimary care-based teams (or individual GPSIs) providing an intermediary service that bridged \nthe gap with clinical genetics specialists\u2014though not always in a way that those specialists \nthought appropriate.14  Other projects, though, attempted to instil a consciousness of the more \nwide-ranging relevance of genetic knowledge among primary care practitioners.  One GPSI, for \nexample (Site 8), held workshops to demonstrate the relevance of genetics to everyday primary \ncare practice, and to assist others to \u2015think genetic\u2016 and keep ahead of the \u2017genomic revolution\u2018.  \nThis approach to the mainstreaming of genetics within primary care, in line with the ethos of the \nWhite Paper, was endorsed by the DH, which saw the pilot programme as a means of raising the \nprofile of genetics throughout the Health Service.  In particular, this meant demonstrating its \ncentrality to general practice, for example, in the management of many chronic diseases, alongside \nnon-genetic environmental factors: \n\u2015The common chronic diseases, most genetics services don\u2018t want to go there. [\u2026] They\u2018re \nconcentrating on learning about more and more rare conditions, and they\u2018re not really \ninterested in getting into the multi-factorial stuff.  We don\u2018t know whether that\u2018s going to \ndeliver, but we need to have a workforce in primary care that\u2018s ready to take it on if it does, \nor able to critique it and say, \u2017We won\u2018t use it\u2018\u2014but they\u2018ve got to know enough about it.\u2016 \n(DH policy lead) \nCrucially, then, this vision implied a much more proactive engagement with genetic knowledge, \nas it related to the aetiology of common chronic conditions, on the part of all primary care \npractitioners.  It was not about the creation of small groups of primary care-based specialists to \nwhom GPs and others could turn on those comparatively rare occasions when clinical genetics \naffected specific patients. \nHowever, most projects were framed in ways that mirrored the existing set-up, and thus \nconsolidated the prevailing institutional arrangements that saw clinical genetics as either an \nesoteric speciality relevant to a small number of patients, or as something accessed via other \nclinical areas such as cancer.  Projects provided more accessible care pathways for patients falling \ninto these categories that were often appreciated by GPs, but they did not reframe genetics as \nsomething that was of more direct, wide-ranging interest in routine primary care practice.  Those \nprojects that did attempt to achieve this found themselves unable to challenge the lack of interest \nthat saw genetics as of peripheral concern to primary care.  The GPSI in Site 8, for example, \nconcluded that despite his best efforts to promulgate the importance of genetics to primary care, \nfor most practitioners, it remained \u2015a speciality for people with rare diseases.\u2016 \nThis is the final draft, after peer-review, of a manuscript published in Journal of Health Services \nResearch & Policy. The definitive version, detailed above, is available online at www.rsmjournals.com. \n\u00a9 2009 Royal Society of Medicine Press Limited \n6 \nThe framing of most projects in terms of specific areas of clinical genetic practice, \nmeanwhile, was often more effective in obtaining buy-in from GPs and other primary care \npractitioners, but, in doing so, consolidated the perception of genetics as something specialised \nand of narrow relevance.  In Site 4, for example, a new cancer genetics referral system was \nintroduced which, as a GP enthused, \u2015allows people in primary care to put patients into roughly \nthree pigeon holes,\u2016 and avoid making inappropriate referrals to oncologists or clinical genetics \nspecialists.  The system had been embraced by primary care practitioners, the GP argued, because \nit meant that \u2015we can stand behind the genetics service and their referral guidelines [\u2026] given \nthat genetics is a relatively new discipline to a lot of GPs who probably wouldn\u2018t have the \nconfidence to vet people out.\u2016  A GP in Site 7 agreed that this kind of approach was appropriate, \nsince \n\u2015there\u2018s not a great deal of skill out there anyway. [\u2026] The majority of GPs are going to be \na lot older than me, so their taught knowledge of genetics is going to be potentially poorer.  \nSo \u2017No\u2018, I don\u2018t think there are any skills that this will undermine\u2014there is not much skill \nthere to be deskilled anyway.\u2016 \nIronically, then, engagement with primary care was most successful when it did not challenge the \nperception of genetics as specialist and peripheral\u2014something for others to concern themselves \nwith\u2014but sustained it.  The implications of this are taken up in the Discussion. \nSustainability, commissioning and long-term prospects \nEven projects that were successful in \u2017mainstreaming genetics\u2018, in their own terms, faced \nproblems in securing ongoing funding.  At the time that many staff were looking to sustain pilots\u2018 \nwork, the NHS was undergoing significant upheaval, involving PCT reorganisations and the \ninsistence from central government that NHS organisations rein in deficits.  In this climate, it was \ndifficult to obtain funding for new services, even if\u2014in the long term\u2014they might offer savings \nthrough earlier detection and better management of inherited illnesses.  Some pilots managed to \ndeal with this challenge.  Site 4, for example, managed to demonstrate a shorter-term saving \nthrough more appropriate use of screening services, while in Site 1 provision was integrated into \nthe business plan of the mainstream disease area of the hosting hospital. \nHowever, the challenges around ongoing commissioning arrangements were not limited to \nshort-term turmoil caused by NHS reorganisation.  They were also associated with the structures \nof the NHS, notably the split between mainstream commissioning, as carried out by individual PCTs, \nand specialist commissioning, performed regionally by PCT consortia.  Most genetics services were \ntraditionally specialist-commissioned, but as pilots explicitly aimed at bridging the gap with \nmainstream provision, the situation was ambiguous for these new services.  Knowledge of \ngenetics issues among mainstream commissioners remained, according to specialist \ncommissioners, rather deficient, despite their increasing relevance to wider health care provision, \nand this did not bode well for \u2017world-class commissioning\u201815 in this field: \n\u2015I think [PCT-level commissioners] will feel fairly shortly that they\u2018re losing control. [\u2026] If \ngenetics goes the way it appears to be heading, there will be a lot more pressure on \ncommissioners to [improve their knowledge].  If they don\u2018t, they will have lost control and \nwill not understand it and will be at the mercy of these scientists who speak a totally \ndifferent language.\u2016 (Specialist commissioner, Site 4) \nYet service providers, too, had fears about this brave new commissioning world, and especially \nthe prospect of integration with other specialities, losing the protection afforded by specialist \ncommissioning arrangements: \n\u2015When genetics just does its own bids to a pot of money for specialised services it\u2018s quite \nneat and tidy and specific.  If we become more mainstreamed and we\u2018re just a sub-bid of a \ncardiology bid or an obesity-clinic bid or whatever, then we might well end up getting \nnothing, partly because we get lost against the headline person making the bid, and genetics \nis just a line at the bottom.  If the full amount of funding isn\u2018t allocated then we\u2018ll probably \nThis is the final draft, after peer-review, of a manuscript published in Journal of Health Services \nResearch & Policy. The definitive version, detailed above, is available online at www.rsmjournals.com. \n\u00a9 2009 Royal Society of Medicine Press Limited \n7 \nbe one of the things that gets chopped off.\u2016 (General manager in clinical genetics \ndepartment, Site 4) \nPractice-based commissioning, in which purchasing decisions are devolved from PCTs to \ngroups of GPs, also seemed a mixed blessing for pilot services.  Respondents from hospital-\nbased pilots expressed concern that practice-based commissioners might be too occupied with \nhigher profile and costlier issues to devote attention to the benefits of their services, and their \npotential incremental improvements in patient experience and reductions in cost.  However, \nthere was a sense from PCT-based pilots that practice-based commissioners would be happy to \nfund small-scale community-based services, if given sufficient backing from PCT management, \nsince they fitted well with the wider commissioning agenda relating to providing care \u2017closer to \nhome\u2018.  Practice-based commissioning, then, neither seemed to threaten these service \ndevelopments, but nor did it generally provide the drive needed to become an established part of \nlocal service provision. \nThere was particular concern about the prospects for \u2017mainstreaming\u2018 genetic knowledge \nand provision in an NHS which remained, for many, dominated by shorter-term issues resulting \nin the neglect of preventive measures.  A cancer network manager in Site 5 summed up the \nsituation in relation to cancer, a field perhaps more subject than most to a forceful centrally \ndriven performance management regime: \n\u2015Genetics is a buzzword: everyone says, \u2017Prevention is better than cure\u2018, understanding that \ncancer networks focus far too much of their attention on treatment.  So, in some ways, the \nvibes are quite good: ideal to have these pilots looking at how you can reach people \neffectively.  [But] if I go to the PCTs with any service development, unless it is linked to a \ntarget or is completely unavoidable, they just say, \u2017You must be mad\u2018.  What they say\u2014\nwhich is true\u2014is: \u2017We haven\u2018t got the money to run the services we\u2018ve got: why would we \nfund new services?\u2018\u2016 \nPCTs, despite their public health focus, found it difficult to raise the profile of genetics given \nmore pressing concerns around acute care commissioning and chronic disease management.  \nThis was compounded for some by departmental divisions within PCTs, which made it difficult \nfor pilots to appeal: \n\u2015I see this as a public health target, but I sit in a different department doing commissioning \nand development, and you\u2018ve got the team of people delivering the service within the \nclinical service department. [\u2026] People working in the NHS are just surviving managing \ndisease, and if these projects can raise the profile, we\u2018ve achieved something, but I want \nmore than that.  The whole thing has to shift to focus onto prevention, not disease \nmanagement.\u2016 (Pilot manager, Site 7) \nDiscussion \nThe findings presented above present a necessarily sweeping overview of the issues facing efforts \nto bring genetics into primary care.  Other publications from the evaluation offer a more \nsustained analysis of some of these issues.14,16,17,18,19  Nevertheless, some important messages are \nevident. \nFirst, the findings mirror those of various studies highlighting the difficulties that arise in \nefforts to promote joined up working between agencies and sectors, especially the impact of \nvertical governance arrangements on the willingness of different stakeholders to engage.20,21  A \nnotable difference, though, between the genetics pilots and, for example, efforts to join up health \nand social care services to improve discharge arrangements for older people,5,22 was the general \nlack of engagement from significant numbers of primary care practitioners.  Whereas, for all their \ndisputes over responsibility, discharge arrangements are regarded as a matter of mutual concern \nfor the acute, primary and social care sectors, here the prevalent view seemed to be that genetics \nwas not of particular relevance to primary care, despite acknowledgement of the potential \nThis is the final draft, after peer-review, of a manuscript published in Journal of Health Services \nResearch & Policy. The definitive version, detailed above, is available online at www.rsmjournals.com. \n\u00a9 2009 Royal Society of Medicine Press Limited \n8 \nimplications of the knowledge arising from the \u2017new genetics\u2018.  The efforts of Site 8\u2018s GPSI, for \nexample, to instil a consciousness of the relevance of genetics to everyday primary care practice \nsucceeded, by his own admission, in engaging only a few practitioners.  An absence of \nrecognition of responsibility would seem to be a key barrier to top-down efforts of this kind to \nencourage knowledge sharing. \nThe existing organisation of genetics in the Health Service partly explains this absence.  \nDirect contact between primary care and clinical genetics departments was rare, except for a \nsmall group of patients; in other cases, specialists in secondary care would usually mediate the \nrelationship.  Since many of the pilots, including those based in primary care, focused on specific \nareas of clinical genetics and provided simplified care pathways that minimised the level of \nknowledge required by GPs and other referrers, they actually consolidated the view of genetics as \nof peripheral concern to primary care, even as they secured the buy-in they required from \nprimary care practitioners.  Those projects that sought to improve knowledge by explaining the \nrising relevance of genetics to day-to-day primary care practice found that, given the \ninstitutionalised marginality of genetics from primary care, most practitioners had more pressing \npriorities.  Paradoxically, then, it seems that if the aim is to achieve something of a \u2017cultural \nchange\u2018 in the primary care workforce, \u2015building expertise and capacity specifically in primary \ncare\u2016 to deal with the anticipated \u2017genomic revolution\u2018,1 through a programme of genetics pilots \nis an ineffective way of achieving change.  If the desired outcome of policymakers is\u2014as the \nWhite Paper suggests\u2014 primary care that sees genetics as central to its everyday practice, then \npiloting new clinical genetics services, even if based in primary care, seems counter-productive, \nserving only to confirm the marginal status of genetics.  Rather, this kind of transformatory \nchange would seem to need to be incorporated into wider policy efforts at reconfiguring the role \nof general practice and creating a primary care-led NHS, so that those pilots seeking to address \nthe general level of knowledge among primary care practitioners are helped, rather than hindered, \nby wider changes. \nThese changes include the consequences of recent UK policy developments such as the \nnew NHS GP contract, which focused GPs more closely on work rewarded by the QOF element \nin the contract, and also seemed to impair pilots\u2018 ability to access other general practice-based \nstaff\u2014though there were differences between general practices in this regard, apparently \nreflecting organisational culture.23  This reflects findings elsewhere in relation to the \nconsequences for surveillance, particularly of lower-status staff such as nurses and health care \nassistants, of the new GP contract, involving more intrusive intra-practice management regimes.24  \nWhile access to general practice staff was problematic for some pilots, simple guidance for \ndealing with patients with suspected inherited conditions was largely appreciated by GPs\u2014\u2015a \ncare pathway and a referral guideline, that\u2018s it,\u2016 as the clinical geneticist in Site 4 summarised.  \nOnce again, though, the result was that genetics remained marginal to the consciousness of most \nprimary care practitioners, even if the introduction of protocols had the potential to improve \npatient care. \nMeanwhile, the reorganisation of the NHS and associated managerial upheavals meant that \ngenetics was at best a side issue for most PCT managers, too.  Though, on the one hand, this \nmight be seen as a consequence of unfortunate timing, it should also be acknowledged that such \nproblems are likely to be repeated given the seemingly perpetual state of reorganisation of the \nNHS\u2014in Walshe\u2018s memorable phrase, \u2015an organizational shantytown in which structures and \nsystems are cobbled together or thrown up hastily in the knowledge that they will be torn down \nagain in due course.\u201625  All in all, a panoply of policy interventions\u2014centrally driven performance \nmanagement, marketisation, and continuous structural revolution\u2014seemed to work against the \njoining up and knowledge-sharing drive of the White Paper, mirroring the policy barriers to the \nmove towards public-service \u2017modernisation\u2018 more widely,4,16 whereby \u2015different policy strands \nhave created unhelpful dissonances.\u201626 \nThis is the final draft, after peer-review, of a manuscript published in Journal of Health Services \nResearch & Policy. The definitive version, detailed above, is available online at www.rsmjournals.com. \n\u00a9 2009 Royal Society of Medicine Press Limited \n9 \nParticularly notable in the context of genetics was the dissonance between mainstream \n(PCT-based) and specialist (PCT consortium-based) commissioning.  The efforts to enfranchise \nindividual PCTs in the development of genetics services exposed the knowledge deficit of their \ncommissioners, who had never previously needed to engage with the area.  This left both pilots \nand existing specialist services uneasy about the changing commissioning scene, with concern \namong clinical genetics departments about the possibility of resources moving away from tertiary \ncare once block funding was replaced by per case commissioning arrangements.  For PCTs, \nmeanwhile, their relatively small size left them unable to plan their genetics provision strategically, \nand for all the rhetoric about a primary care-led NHS, the power of hospital-based providers \nremained great, given their sway over knowledge and historically entrenched positional power.  \nConcerns over the capacity and knowledge of mainstream commissioners in this field, and the \nloss of what Paton calls \u2015meso-level planning\u201626 resulting from the division of commissioning \nresponsibilities, threatened a lack of strategic direction in service provision, and suggested that in \ngenetics, at least, the challenges identified for \u2017world-class commissioning\u2018 by Ham are indeed \nprofound.15 \nConclusion \nThe pilots funded through this programme had varying degrees of success in establishing and \nsustaining their work to raise awareness and embed genetics within primary care practice, but the \nchallenges faced were common to many of them.  Policies that mitigate competing pressures for \npractitioners might assist the uptake of initiatives of this kind.  A range of strategies deployed by \npilot staff such as extensive and persistent educational work, alignment with national targets and \ndrawing on the agency of interested patients or influential local stakeholders resulted in some \nlocal successes in achieving change.  Such strategies, however, were not viable for all pilots, and \npersistent features of NHS policy, organisation and culture meant that if initiatives such as these \nwere to realise the ambitions of the White Paper to infuse genetics knowledge and provision \nthroughout the Health Service, they needed considerably more support from policy makers and \nlocal managers alike, and arguably needed to be framed not in terms of clinical genetics provision \nseen as marginal by many primary-care practitioners, but as a key part of more general reforms of \nthe role of primary care in the NHS. \nAcknowledgements \nThe evaluation from which this paper is drawn was funded by the UK Department of Health. \nWe would like to thank the research participants for their time and input, and two anonymous \nreferees for their helpful comments \nReferences \n \n1 Secretary of State for Health.
