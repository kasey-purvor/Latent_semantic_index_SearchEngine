ID 125903); published June 11, 2010\nInterface states are known to exist at the surface of an appropriately structured Bragg reflector. If such reflectors are\npresent on the surfaces of two prisms separated by a narrow gap, the evanescently coupled interface states can\ninteract to produce a pair of very narrow transmission lines, the separation of which can be adjusted by varying\nthe size of the gap between the two prisms. Thus, although only a single cavity is involved, the spectral properties\nof the system are similar to those of a dual-cavity photonic microstructure. In addition to other potential applica-\ntions, we propose that such a structure could form the basis of an adjustable beat-frequency emitter in the terahertz\nregime. \u00a9 2010 Optical Society of America\nOCIS codes: 120.2440, 140.3948, 230.7408, 240.0240.\nSome time ago, Yeh et al. [1] demonstrated how the trans-\nfer matrix method could be applied to the study of elec-\ntromagnetic surface waves or photonic interface states at\nthe boundary of a multilayer dielectric structure. In the\ncase of a multilayer structure on the surface of a prism,\nemploying a total internal reflection (TIR) configuration,\nNelson and Haus [2] discussed, theoretically, how such\nsharp interface states might be revealed in reflection ex-\nperiments as a consequence of the associated phase\nchange. In transmission, the use of the evanescent waves\nassociated with a simple dual-prism TIR configuration\nwith an intervening air gap for photographic image pro-\ncessing applications has been described by Bhan and\nMehta [3]. In this Letter, we demonstrate how the com-\nbination of a dual-prism system overlaid with multilayer\ndielectric coatings, and the consequent interaction of\ntheir coupled interface states, can lead to a structure\nwith a number of potential wavelength selective practical\napplications.\nTo demonstrate the nature of the interaction, first con-\nsider light incident at an angle of \u03b8 \u00bc 45\u00b0 from a uniform\nmedium with a refractive index of 1.47 through a multi-\nlayer structure onto air. Only TM-polarized light is con-\nsidered, in which the magnetic field, H, is entirely\nparallel to the interfaces. The multilayer structure con-\nsists of 17 pairs of high-\/low-index layers, forming a stan-\ndard Bragg reflector (BR) and a final, somewhat thicker,\nlayer of the high-index material bordering the air gap.\nThe refractive indices of the high- and low-index BR\nlayers are taken to be 2.37 and 1.47 which are represen-\ntative [4] of the values for TiO2 and SiO2, and their re-\nspective thicknesses are fixed at 204 nm and 328 nm.\nThe final high-index layer bordering the air gap is taken\nto have a width of 265 nm. For good-quality materials we\nare justified in the neglect of absorption as, even with the\nenhanced field values reported below, the small extinc-\ntion coefficients in the infrared region [5] mean that there\nis no significant effect on our results. The structure has\nbeen designed using the phase-matching approach de-\nscribed elsewhere [6], in order that the BR has a photonic\nbandgap centered at 0:8 eV at the incident angle of 45\u00b0,\nwith the thickness of the final layer adjusted so as to po-\nsition the associated photonic interface state at that same\nenergy. As the critical angle for the complete system is\n42:9\u00b0, no transmission would be expected at the chosen\nangle of 45\u00b0, and, hence, the calculated power reflection\ncoefficient R \u00bc 1. However, if an identical multilayer\nstructure is positioned at the opposite side of a narrow\nair gap with the separation being of the order of a few\nmicrometers, as shown in Fig. 1, transmission is possible\ndue to the coupling between the interface states asso-\nciated with the two structures. The system considered\nin this Letter is essentially as shown in Fig. 1, except that\nthe prisms are considered as being infinite in extent so\nthat there are effectively no exterior surfaces. We note\nthat there is no significant transmission through the\nstructure in the wavelength range considered for the al-\nternative, TE polarization, for which there are no asso-\nciated interface states, and thus the structure has an\nintrinsic polarization-selective functionality.\nThe transmission coefficient for path T in Fig. 1 has\nbeen calculated using a standard transfer matrix ap-\nproach, and results are shown in Fig. 2 for the case of\na 3:5 \u03bcm air gap. For comparison, the transmission\nthrough a conventional 69-layer BR is also shown, clearly\ndemonstrating a distinctive photonic bandgap region.\nThe effect of the air gap is to give rise to TIR and\nconsequent near-zero transmission over most of the\nwavelength range shown, but coupling between the\nFig. 1. Basic structure, consisting of two back-to-back prisms\nwith overlaid BRs, separated by a small air gap. For the cal-\nculations described, the outer prism surfaces are effectively\nextended to infinity. For transmission purposes, the light path\nis in direction T, whereas the reflected light follows path R with\n\u03b8 \u00bc 45\u00b0.\nJune 15, 2010 \/ Vol. 35, No. 12 \/ OPTICS LETTERS 2085\n0146-9592\/10\/122085-03$15.00\/0 \u00a9 2010 Optical Society of America\ninterface states results in two sharp peaks in the trans-\nmission spectrum. In the absence of the multilayer struc-\ntures on the surfaces of the two prisms, and their\nassociated interface states, the transmission coefficient\nis small throughout the range considered, as is apparent\nin Fig. 2. A more detailed illustration of the transmission\ncoefficient for several different air-gap separation values\non an expanded wavelength scale is shown in Fig. 3. As\ncan be seen, the transmission lines are narrow and, in\nterms of energy, the separation of the line-pairs shown\nranges up to about 6 meV with a corresponding fre-\nquency of 1:5 THz as the air-gap width is decreased to\n3 \u03bcm. The average energy of the two transmission peaks\nis centered at the isolated interface state design value of\n0:8 eV, independent of the width of the air gap. In the\ncase of the 3:5 \u03bcm air gap, a snapshot in time of the as-\nsociated H field is shown in Fig. 4 for both the lower and\nupper energy transmission peaks associated with the fea-\ntures labeled S and A, respectively, in Fig. 3. The plots are\ncharacteristic of symmetric and antisymmetric combina-\ntions of the isolated interface evanescent states. We note\nthat the associated time-averaged field intensity (H2) is\norders of magnitude higher than that of the incident wave\nacross much of the air gap, and across all of the gap in the\nsymmetric case. If a thin metallic layer is introduced at\nthe interior prism\/multilayer interface, it is possible to en-\nhance the field still further, consistent with an observa-\ntion in our earlier work [7], although this is at the expense\nof a reduced transmission coefficient.\nAs the existence of the evanescent states and their en-\nergy are dependent upon the material in the gap between\nthe two prisms and the angle of incidence, the separation\nof the transmission lines can be altered by varying these\nparameters. In practice, there will be some additional\nbroadening in an actual structure because of natural\nvariations in the BR layer widths, which will depend\non the reliability of the BR fabrication process employed,\nand the use of a smaller number of layers in the BR would\nalso increase the broadening. Use of a structure with a\nlarger refractive index contrast would give rise to a nar-\nrowing of the linewidth, or allow a smaller number of\nlayers to be employed but would also involve a change\nin the prism geometry. We note that in order to maximize\ntransmission, it is essential to maintain the symmetry of\nthe multilayer structures on the surfaces of the two\nprisms, and this can be most simply achieved in practice\nby fabricating the two multilayer structures in the same\ngrowth run. A relative difference of a few percent in the\nwidths of the two layers adjacent to the air gap gives rise\nto a noticeable broadening and effectively halves the\nvalue of the transmission coefficient. On the other hand,\nFig. 2.

The air gap\ncauses the structure to behave as an effective total internal re-\nflector over most of the range shown, but the interaction be-\ntween the evanescent fields of the photonic interface states\nleads to two distinctive narrow-width transmission lines, which\nare shown on an expanded wavelength scale in Fig. 3.\nFig. 3.

In the weak coupling regime with an air\ngap of 7050 nm, the single effectively flat-top transmission fea-\nture has a FWHM of 0:15 nm, whereas there is a FWHM \u00bc\n0:11 nm for the 3000 nm air gap.\nFig. 4.

The incident H field has unit amplitude.\n2086 OPTICS LETTERS \/ Vol. 35, No. 12 \/ June 15, 2010\nbecause of the exponential envelope of the field profile,\nvariations in layer widths away from the air gap have a\ndecreasing effect. In a practical situation, it should be\npossible to compensate for a variation of a few percent\nin the thickness across the final layer by an appropriate\nadjustment of beam position and the relative position of\nthe two prisms to achieve high transmission. The juxta-\nposition of the regions on the surface can be altered by\nmoving the prisms parallel to each other without affect-\ning the gap width.\nWe note that the structure, as described, could be em-\nployed to produce an optical flat-topped notch or narrow\nbandpass filter, depending on whether the reflected or\ntransmitted output is employed. For the current design,\nthis occurs when there is weak coupling between the in-\nterface states with an air-gap width of 7050 nm, a sce-\nnario illustrated in Fig. 3. A more conventional structure\ndesigned to produce such a flat-top transmission feature\ninvolving the interaction between states in a pair of mi-\ncrocavities was studied by Beggs et al. [8]. The dual-\nprism structure properties are rather different from those\nof a conventional normal incidence BR because the re-\njected frequencies emerge at right angles to the incident\nand transmitted frequency components rather than being\nreflected antiparallel to the incident radiation. The struc-\nture thus has potential uses as, for example, a component\nof an otherwise conventional laser system as a means of\nlaser mode control: only those modes compatible with\nthe allowed transmission features of the structure are\navailable to encourage laser action, whereas all other\nmodes are suppressed. With the use of an appropriate\nphotomixer external to the dual-prism structure it may\nbe possible to produce beat-frequency terahertz radiation\nfrom the transmitted beam. (See [9\u201313] for both general\naccounts and specific examples of the use of the beat-fre-\nquency concept for terahertz frequency generation.) In a\nmore ambitious approach, the structure might be em-\nployed with nonlinear material placed directly within\nthe multilayer structure or with the material of the prisms\ncomprising the lasing medium. Because of the enhanced\nfield within the gap, a nonlinear material with a relatively\nmodest response, such as that observed in a number of\norganic materials, could possibly be placed in this region.\nHowever, the refractive index within the gap would then\nbe in the region of, say, 1.5. Consequently, higher refrac-\ntive index prisms and an alternative multilayer structure\nwould be required in order to satisfy the condition for\nTIR. Clearly these more speculative ideas would require\nfurther investigation.\nAlthough a particular combination of multilayer struc-\nture and materials has been considered in this work, with\ncorresponding implications for the operational frequency\nrange, the general results are applicable to other systems\nin which the photonic bandgap and characteristic inter-\nface state energies can be readily adjusted and a modified\nprism refractive index and geometry employed.\nReferences\n1.
