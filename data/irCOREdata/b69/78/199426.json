Numerous calls \nhave been made for accounting educators to adopt strategies that produce such results. This paper \nreports on changes to the learning environment centring on the introduction of group learning \nactivities that were designed to improve the quality of students\u2019 learning outcomes. The impact of \nchanges in the learning environment on students\u2019 approaches to learning, as measured by the \nStudy Process Questionnaire (SPQ) (Biggs, 1987b), was then assessed. Results indicate that \nacross the semester, accounting students exhibited a small but statistically significant increase in \ntheir deep learning approach, and a small but statistically significant reduction in their surface \nlearning approach. The results suggest that accounting educators, through changes in the learning \nenvironment, may be able to influence the learning approaches adopted by accounting students.  \n \nKEY WORDS: approaches to learning, study process questionnaire, deep, surface \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \nThere have been numerous calls for changes in accounting education in order to address the \nperceived deficiencies in accounting graduates (for example, Accounting Education Change \nCommission (AECC) 1990, Mathews Report, 1988). A fundamental concern is for accounting \neducation to establish a base for accounting graduates to develop life-long learning skills. In \nparticular, in Australia, the accounting profession requires that accounting educators incorporate \nactivities into the learning environment that develop life-long learning skills, analytical thinking, \nand the ability to work in teams. To achieve this, accounting education should move away from \nprocedural tasks and memorising of professional standards to a more conceptual and analytical \nform of learning (Beattie, Collins and McInnes, 1997; Davidson, 2002). Methods and techniques \nused to facilitate this type of learning include case studies, group-based learning, cooperative \nlearning approaches, and specific tasks designed to address communication and presentation \nskills (Rebele, Apostolou, Buckless, Hassell, Paquette, and Stout, 1998; Booth, Luckett and \nMladenovic, 1999). These teaching techniques are considered suitable for the development of the \nappropriate competencies in accounting graduates.  \nThe learning approaches adopted by accounting students may be a key factor influencing the \nquality of their learning outcomes (Booth et al., 1999; Davidson, 2002). The concepts underlying \nstudent approaches to learning were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and are now firmly \nestablished in the higher education literature (Beattie et al., 1997). Student approaches to learning \ntend to be dichotomised into deep and surface approaches. High-quality learning outcomes, such \nas analytical and conceptual thinking skills, may not be achieved unless students are encouraged \nto adopt deep approaches to learning. Sharma (1997, p.128) states that \u201cin terms of competencies \nneeded to become a successful professional accountant, fostering a deep approach to learning is \n4 \ncritical\u201d. Prior research indicates that accounting students seem to adopt higher surface learning \napproaches and lower deep learning approaches compared to other university students (Eley, \n1992; Gow, Kember and Cooper, 1994; Booth et al., 1999). Therefore, consideration of ways to \nencourage accounting students to adopt a deep approach to learning is of considerable importance \nto both accounting educators and the accounting profession.  \nThe purpose of this study is twofold. First, the study describes the changes made to the learning \nenvironment of a second semester, introductory financial accounting subject.  These changes \nfocused on the use of group-based problem solving activities.  The aim of these changes was to \ngenerate higher quality learning outcomes, such as greater engagement with the subject, and \nimproved analytical and conceptual thinking skills.  Second, the study uses the Study Process \nQuestionnaire (SPQ) (Biggs, 1987b) to assess any changes in students\u2019 deep and surface \napproaches to learning across the semester in which the subject was taught. Therefore, consistent \nwith calls by Rebele et al. (1998), the study describes specific changes made to the learning \nenvironment and reports on the observed effects of these changes. \nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: the next section reviews the approaches to \nlearning literature, and in particular, its application to accounting students. Next, the specific \nchanges made to the learning environment are outlined. This is followed by the presentation of \nthe research question and the research design employed in the study. The following sections \nreport and discuss the results of the study. The final section provides some conclusions.  \n \n5 \nAPPROACHES TO LEARNING OF ACCOUNTING STUDENTS \nResearch related to student approaches to learning has been drawn from a wide range of sources. \nThese sources include the Lancaster group (Entwistle and Wilson, 1970; Entwistle, Thompson \nand Wilson, 1974), the Australian group (Biggs, 1978; 1987a), the Swedish group (Marton and \nSaljo, 1976a, 1976b), and the Richmond group (Pask, 1976). Some researchers have adopted \nquantitative methods based on psychometric techniques (Biggs 1987a, Entwistle and Wilson, \n1970), whereas others used more qualitative methods, for example, the phenomenographical \napproach (Lucas, 2001). While these strands of the literature were initially independent of each \nother, the research shared many themes and concepts. In the 1980s, researchers worked together \nto establish greater consistency in the language and approaches used. This research has identified \ntwo main ways that students approach learning: the surface approach and the deep approach.  \nA surface approach to learning is characterised by an intention to acquire only sufficient \nknowledge to complete the task or pass the subject. As such, the student relies on memorisation \nand reproduction of material and does not seek further connections, meaning, or the implications \nof what is learned (Biggs, 1987a; Eley, 1992; Ramsden, 1992; Biggs and Moore, 1993; Gow et \nal., 1994; Sharma, 1997; Booth et al., 1999; Prosser and Trigwell, 1999). A surface approach is \nexternally focused and tends to result in a lack of engagement with the subject, the accumulation \nof unrelated pieces of information for assessment purposes, and temporary learning \noutcomes (Biggs and Moore, 1993; Beattie et al., 1997; Booth et al., 1999). Students are unlikely \nto experience high-quality learning outcomes, or develop appropriate skills and competencies, \nthrough a surface approach to learning.  \n6 \nA deep approach to learning is characterised by a personal commitment to learning and an \ninterest in the subject. The student approaches learning with the intention to understand and seek \nmeaning, and, consequently, searches for relationships among the material and interprets \nknowledge in light of previous knowledge structures and experiences (Watkins and Hattie, 1985; \nBiggs, 1987a; Eley, 1992; Ramsden, 1992; Biggs and Moore, 1993; Gow et al., 1994; Beattie et \nal., 1997; Sharma, 1997; Booth et al., 1999; Prosser and Trigwell, 1999). A deep approach to \nlearning is more likely to result in better retention and transfer of knowledge (Ramsden, 1992) \nand may lead to quality learning outcomes, such as a good understanding of the discipline and \ncritical thinking skills (Booth et al., 1999).  \nThe approaches-to-learning literature has operationalised aspects of the learning process in \nseveral ways. Entwistle and Ramsden (1983) developed the Approaches to Studying Inventory \n(ASI), while Biggs (1987b) developed the Study Process Questionnaire (SPQ). The development \nof the Biggs version of the students\u2019 approaches to learning literature is briefly outlined below. \nUsing the SPQ, three approaches to learning (surface, deep and achieving) were identified.1 The \nstudy process or approach to learning is defined by Biggs as a combination of students\u2019 \nmotives (why?) and the strategies (how?) they use in learning (Biggs 1987a). Biggs hypothesised \nthat effective learning requires congruence between the motive and strategy adopted. For \nexample, if a student\u2019s motive is to develop an interest and competence in a subject area, then \nemploying a rote-learning strategy is unlikely to lead to effective learning outcomes. \nBiggs (1987a) elaborates on this model by demonstrating that students are able to choose \ndeliberately the approaches that are most likely to result in the desired learning outcome, a \nconcept referred to as metalearning. \n7 \nThe essential difference between a surface approach and a deep approach is in the student\u2019s \nintentions, or motives, for studying.  Under the deep motive, the student\u2019s intention is to seek \nmeaning, whereas under the surface motive, the student\u2019s intention is to acquire only sufficient \nknowledge to complete the task.  As such, a student cannot, simultaneously, adopt a surface \nmotive and a deep motive in his\/her study. In contrast, a surface strategy and a deep strategy are \nnot incompatible.  A student adopting a deep strategy will use memorisation\/reproduction and \nseek further connections and relationships to prior knowledge, whereas a student adopting a \nsurface strategy relies on memorisation and reproduction only.  In the context of the SPQ, Birkett \nand Mladenovic (2002) argue that there is a mismatch between the theoretical framework and \nempirical measurement of the strategy aspect of the deep approach to learning. The quantitative \nmeasure of the strategy aspect of the deep approach to learning, using the SPQ, only measures \nhigher cognitive levels (from comprehend to reflect), with the lower cognitive levels (memorise \nto describe) measured in the strategy aspect of the surface approach to learning. However, the \ntheoretical construct of the deep approach to learning encompasses the entire range of cognitive \nlevels (from memorise to reflect), not only those at the higher end. Thus, the SPQ treats low and \nhigh cognitive levels as dichotomous, whereas the theory describes them as a continuum. \nThe approaches-to-learning paradigm has been applied to accounting education only relatively \nrecently.  Eley (1992) compared the learning approaches of students across different subjects at \nthe same University and found that second-year accounting students adopted a lower deep \napproach and a higher surface approach compared to biochemistry, chemistry, and English \nliterature students. Similarly, Booth et al. (1999) found that second- and third-year accounting \nstudents across two Australian universities adopted lower deep and higher surface approaches \ncompared to the reported \u2018norms\u2019 for Australian arts, education, and science students. In a \n8 \nlongitudinal study, Gow et al. (1994) reported that accounting students\u2019 use of a deep approach \ndeclined from the first year to the second year, and then increased to the end of the third year. \nHowever, the use of a deep approach at the end of the third year was still below the first-year \nlevel. More recent studies show similar results (Pilcher, 2003). The results of these studies \nsuggest that accounting students appear to favour surface learning approaches over deep learning \napproaches. If correct, this is likely to be of concern to accounting educators.  \nA critical issue is whether students\u2019 approaches to learning are static and inherent in individuals \nor whether approaches to learning are influenced by the learning context, including teaching \nmethods, curriculum and assessment. Early theoretical research took the view that approaches to \nlearning were inherent in individuals and thus fixed (Beattie et al., 1997). This view was altered \nby research in the 1980s where it was acknowledged that students\u2019 approaches to learning were \ncontext specific. The Biggs (1978) model indicated that presage factors, both personal and \ninstitutional, affected the choice of students\u2019 approach to learning. Biggs (1987a) model \nrecognised that context and task, as perceived by the students, influenced the approach to \nlearning used. Biggs\u2019 notion of congruence in the students\u2019 choices of motive and strategy, and \nhis concept of metalearning, requires that students are aware of their motives and have control \nover their strategy selection and implementation. \nRamsden (1992) presents a model of Student Learning in Context that identifies the students\u2019 \norientation to study and the context of learning as key variables affecting the choice of students\u2019 \napproaches to learning. These theoretical models lead to the conclusion that \u201cthe learning context \nis the mechanism through which teachers can affect students\u2019 motives, perceptions and \napproaches they use in learning\u201d (Birkett and Mladenovic, 2002, p.14).  \n9 \nEmpirical research has also addressed the issue of whether students\u2019 approaches to learning can \nchange. A substantial body of empirical research indicates that students adapt their learning \napproach according to their perceptions of the learning environment (Biggs, 1978; Ramsden, \n1992; Biggs and Moore, 1993; Prosser and Trigwell, 1999; Lucas, 2001, Zeegers, 2001). In \nreference to accounting education, Eley (1992) found that students\u2019 approaches to learning \ndiffered across different subjects within the same course. In particular, results showed that the \nsame students adopted lower deep and higher surface approaches in accounting compared to \nbusiness law.  \nThe learning environment or learning context consists of the assessment methods, curriculum, \nteaching methods and the atmosphere of the institution (Ramsden, 1992). Although educators do \nnot have control over students\u2019 past learning experiences or their personal characteristics, they do \nhave control over the learning environment. Gow et al. (1994) suggested factors that could result \nin students adopting surface approaches to learning in accounting include: excessive workloads; \nthe nature of assessment tasks; a didactic teaching style; and low staff\/student ratios. Similarly, \nSharma (1997) found that the structure of the course and lectures; enthusiasm of lecturers and \ntutors; generation of a personal learning context; provision of student feedback; and the provision \nof direction to students, are crucial elements affecting students\u2019 choice of their approaches to \nlearning in accounting education. Importantly, these characteristics of the learning environment \nare amenable to change, and therefore provide a way for accounting educators to influence the \nlearning approaches adopted by accounting students.  The next section describes the specific \nchanges made to the learning environment of a second semester, introductory financial \naccounting subject that emerged in response to concerns regarding the way that our accounting \nstudents were approaching their learning tasks.   \n10 \nCHANGING THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT \nThe authors are involved in teaching a second semester, first-year introductory financial \naccounting subject that can only be taken after completing an introductory Accounting Principles \nunit.  The content of the subject consists of issues relating to the recording and reporting of \nassets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and equity; the conceptual framework for financial \nreporting; financial statement analysis including financial stability, profitability and share \ninvestment decisions; and consideration and evaluation of alternative accounting measurement \nsystems. Students attend two one-hour lectures and a one and a half hour tutorial per week. Staff \nteaching the subject had attempted to adopt a conceptual focus with emphasis on analytical \nthinking and evaluation of information rather than performing routine tasks. However, it was \nperceived by teaching staff that there was a lack of engagement on the part of the students, which \ncontributed to the adoption of a mechanical and superficial (surface learning) approach.  \nConsistent with Gordon and Debus (2002), it was decided to make limited changes to the \nlearning environment that focused on the tutorial program. Lectures continued largely unchanged. \nPreviously, the tutorial program involved tutors providing solutions to accounting problems that \nhad been completed by students prior to the tutorial. The tutorial program was redesigned to \ninclude group problem-solving exercises, group presentations, and group assignments. The focus \non group work and the use of case studies was intended to increase students\u2019 engagement with \nthe material, develop critical thinking and problem solving skills, and to promote the use of deep \napproaches to learning by students. The changes made to the learning environment were \nconsistent with recommendations by the AECC (1990, pp. 309-10): \n\u201cstudents must be active participants in the learning process, not passive \nrecipients of information. They should identify and solve unstructured \n11 \nproblems that require use of multiple information sources. Learning by \ndoing should be emphasized. Working in groups should be encouraged. \nCreative use of technology is essential. Accounting classes should not \nfocus only on accounting knowledge. Teaching methods that expand and \nreinforce basic communication, intellectual, and interpersonal skills should \nbe used\u201d.  \nSimilarly, accounting educators recommend the use of case studies, group-based learning, \ncooperative learning approaches, and specific tasks designed to address communication and \npresentation skills (Rebele et al., 1998, Booth et al., 1999).   \nThe changes made to the tutorial program were designed to change the teaching style by making \ntutorials more student and less teacher centred (Gow et al., 1994). In addition, it was hoped that \nthe emphasis on group work would pass more of the responsibility for learning back to the \nstudents. The research evidence suggests that, appropriately implemented, group work is \nassociated with adoption of deep approaches to learning (Ramsden, 1992; Tempone and Martin, \n1999; Gordon and Debus, 2002). The specific changes to the tutorial program are now outlined.  \nAt the beginning of the semester, students in each tutorial were assigned to a group of four to five \nmembers and remained in this group during the semester. The revised tutorial program required \neach group to work on three different types of group activities, each of which was designed to \nlead to high quality learning outcomes and promote deep approaches to learning.  \nThe first activity involved all groups working each week in tutorials on problem-solving \nexercises. Consistent with the conceptual nature of the subject, the exercises focused on the \nidentification and resolution of particular accounting issues concerning the topic of that week\u2019s \ntutorial. Group members were encouraged to discuss and debate issues arising from the exercises. \nGroup members were also encouraged to use the computer equipment provided in the tutorial \nroom to access additional resources, including the subject website and other information via the \n12 \nInternet. For example, in the tutorial concerning investment decisions, students were encouraged \nto locate the annual reports of companies on the Internet to identify their specific accounting \npolicies and other relevant financial information. Following completion of the exercises, groups \nwere required to discuss the issues, prepare a written answer and debate their answers with the \nother groups in the tutorial class.  \nThe second group activity was a group presentation. Each group was required once during the \nsemester to prepare and present the solution to a problem to the tutorial class. All group members \nwere required to participate in the group presentation. Problems set usually consisted of both \nnumerical and theoretical analysis. Each presentation required the use of PowerPoint and the data \nprojector provided in the tutorial room. At the end of the presentation, groups were required to \nanswer questions from the tutor and other groups in the tutorial. The tutor provided each group \nwith feedback on the content and delivery of the presentation (Sharma, 1997).  \nIn addition to the in-tutorial group exercises and group presentation, each group was also \nresponsible for completing two group assignments outside class time. The first and larger \nassignment consisted of a case study examining a range of financial reporting issues. The \nassignment required students to make decisions relating to the preparation of end-of-period \nfinancial reports for a business in which issues relating to the determination of the final \naccounting numbers had not been resolved. Groups were required to solve these problems by \ninvestigating the relevant accounting principles and standards, applying these to the facts, and \nproviding written justification for their proposed treatment. Many of the issues discussed did not \nhave definitive answers and judgments were required. The second assignment consisted of a \nsmall financial statement analysis problem. The task involved the use of a specified framework to \nidentify, analyse and make a decision about the particular issues in the problem. Each group was \n13 \nalso required to present a particular section of the second assignment to the tutorial class. Some \nof the changes to the learning environment are similar to those outlines in Catanach, Croll and \nGrinaker (2000); however, they employ a business activity model with students organised into \nprofessional service teams. \nGroup activities two and three were also assessment tasks. As Table 1 shows, 20% of the total \nmarks for the subject was allocated to group activities. This is a substantial proportion of the total \nassessment and sufficient to affect students\u2019 motivation and effort in the subject (Feichtner and \nDavis, 1992). The total number of tasks that were assessed did not increase as a result of the \nchanges to the learning environment outlined above. However, the nature of the assessments did \nchange with a shift from individual to group-based assessment and (marginally) from \nexamination-based to continuous assessment.  \n<Insert Table 1 here> \nExcessive workloads are identified by Gow et al., (1994) as a possible reason for accounting \nstudents adopting surface approaches to learning. The changes made to the learning environment \ndid not attempt to address all the factors suggested by Gow et al., (1994) and Sharma (1997) as \npossible reasons for accounting students adopting surface approaches to learning. \nRESEARCH METHOD \nHaving agreed on these changes to the learning environment, the authors then decided to evaluate \nthe possible effects of these changes on students\u2019 approaches to learning. Prior evidence on the \nsuccess of intervention strategies aimed at encouraging deep approaches to learning is mixed.  \nRamsden, Beswick and Bowden, (1986) showed that an intervention strategy aimed at increasing \n14 \nstudents\u2019 deep approaches to learning actually had the opposite effect, with students decreasing \ntheir deep approach to learning and increasing their surface approach to learning.  Biggs and \nRihn (1984) present more encouraging results, with students involved in a learning-skills \nprogram increasing their deep approach and reducing their surface approach. However, as the \nauthors note, the students were highly selected and highly motivated, the ideal candidates for \nsuch an intervention.   \nThese results suggest that it may be relatively easy to induce a surface approach to learning, but \nmuch more difficult to develop a deep approach to learning. Possible reasons for this include the \ndifficulty of overcoming entrenched notions of learning and studying on the part of students and \nthe difficulty associated with students responding to their perceived learning environment, not the \nlearning environment envisaged by the teacher. As such, interventions designed to alter the \nlearning environment may have unpredictable effects on student approaches to \nlearning (Ramsden, 1992; Richardson, 2000).  \nAlthough a wide variety of innovative instructional approaches have been implemented, research \nthat examines the possible effects of those changes on students\u2019 learning approaches or learning \noutcomes is sparse. Rebele et al. (1998) argue that more research is needed to ascertain the effect \nof changes to the curriculum and\/or the learning environment. Although research has examined \nchanges in accounting students\u2019 approaches to learning over time (Gow et al., 1994) and across \ndifferent subjects (Eley, 1992), there is little research on whether specific changes in the learning \nenvironment influence accounting students\u2019 approaches to learning. Thus, the research question \nto be addressed in this study is: \n15 \nAre modifications to the learning environment of a second semester introductory \naccounting subject associated with increases in students\u2019 reliance on deep approaches to \nlearning and\/or decreases in students\u2019 reliance on surface approaches to learning? \nSample \nTo examine changes in students\u2019 approaches to learning a longitudinal study design was \nemployed. Data were collected from first-year accounting undergraduates studying at university, \nat the commencement of the subject and then again at the end of the teaching period. A survey \nwas administered to students during a lecture in the first week (Trial 1), and the last week (Trial \n2), of second semester, 2001, with approximately 12 weeks between Trials. Surveys were \nadministered to all students attending the relevant lecture. Details of the sample and response \nrates at each trial are provided in Table 2. Of the usable responses obtained from Trial 1 and Trial \n2, a total of 158 of the 427 students completed the questionnaire at both trials, resulting in an \noverall response rate of 37%. Data for these 158 students were used to examine the research \nquestion.  \nTests for non-response bias were conducted following the procedure in Ramsden et al. (1986). \nStudents who completed only Trial 1 were compared to students who completed both Trial 1 and \nTrial 2. Variables used for comparison were age, tertiary entrance score, final mark for the prior \naccounting subject, final mark for this subject, and gender. Results from t-tests and a \nMann-Whitney U-Test revealed no significant differences between the groups on these variables. \nThese results provide some support that the sample is representative of the population of students \nundertaking the subject. Also, similar to Booth et al. (1999), the survey for both trials was \nadministered during typical lectures in an effort to capture \u2018normal\u2019 attendance behaviour.  \n<insert Table 2 here> \n16 \nData Collection \nThe survey instrument consisted of the SPQ developed by Biggs (1987b). The SPQ comprises 42 \nitems and was answered using a fully anchored 5-point scale ranging from (1) never or only \nrarely true of me to (5) always or almost always true of me. Students\u2019 responses to the SPQ were \naggregated following the procedure in Biggs (1987b). Responses were initially aggregated into \nthe motive and strategy subscales for the surface and deep learning approaches (range: 7 to 35). \nThe matched motive and strategy subscales were further aggregated resulting in an overall \nsurface and deep approach to learning score for each student (range: 14 to 70).2 The same \nprocedure was used for each trial.  \nThe SPQ has been used extensively in prior research and has been shown to have satisfactory \nreliability and construct validity (Biggs, 1987a; Beattie et al., 1997; Booth et al., 1999; Zeegers, \n2001; Davidson, 2002).  The reliability of the SPQ in this study was assessed using \nCronbach\u2019s (1951) alpha, with values calculated for each learning approach scale (surface and \ndeep) at each trial.  Results show values ranging from a low of 0.752 for the surface approach \nscale at Trial 1 to a high of 0.834 for the surface approach scale at Trial 2.  The reliability values \nin this study are similar to those reported in previous studies (for example, see Biggs (1987a) and \nZeegers (2001)).  Furthermore, all reliability statistics are above the benchmark of 0.70 suggested \nby Nunally (1978) as demonstrating sufficient reliability.   \nTest-retest reliability was assessed by calculating the correlation coefficient between SPQ scores \nacross the two trials. Correlations were 0.389 for the surface learning approach and 0.612 for the \ndeep learning approach, with all correlations statistically significant (p < 0.01, two-tailed).  \n17 \nIn order to employ a repeated-measures design, students were also requested to provide their \nstudent identity numbers on the survey instrument. Consistent with university ethics policy, \nreported results do not identify individual students.  \nThe Biggs (1987a) model indicates that presage factors, both personal and institutional, affect the \nstudent\u2019s choice of approaches to learning. The personal factors identified by Biggs include prior \nknowledge, ability and personality. In order to control, as far as possible, for the effects of \npersonal factors, data were also collected on students\u2019 age, gender, and proxies for general \nacademic ability and prior accounting performance. Age and gender information was obtained \nfrom university student records using students\u2019 identity numbers. General academic ability was \nproxied using students\u2019 tertiary entrance score3 and was also obtained from student records. Prior \naccounting performance information was proxied using students\u2019 overall mark (out of 100) for a \nfirst-semester accounting principles subject, which is the prerequisite for enrolment in the subject \nexamined in this paper. The marks were obtained from records held by the authors.  \nRESULTS \nTable 3 reports SPQ descriptive statistics for Trial 1 and Trial 2. The mean scores for the surface \napproach (47.61, 46.24) and deep learning approach (42.89, 43.79) are reasonably consistent with \nSPQ scores reported for accounting students in prior studies. Recent studies by Davidson (2002) \nin Canada and Booth et al. (1999) in Australia, report surface approach scores of 50.6 and 51.2, \nand deep approach scores of 48.7 and 42.2, respectively. Our results are similar to those reported \nby Booth et al. (1999), particularly for the deep learning approach. This provides some evidence \non the consistency of accounting students approaches to learning scores across different \nuniversities in Australia.  \n18 \n<insert Table 3 here> \nChanges in Learning Approaches \nThe research question is whether specific changes in the learning environment are associated with \nan increase in deep and\/or a reduction in surface approach to learning.  To examine this question, \na multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to determine whether, collectively, \nthere were changes in students\u2019 approaches to learning scores between Trial 1 and Trial 2.4  To \nconduct this analysis, two variables were created, \u2206SURFACE and \u2206DEEP.  \n\u2206SURFACE (\u2206DEEP) was calculated as Trial 2 surface (deep) SPQ score minus Trial 1 \nsurface (deep) SPQ score.  The results of the MANOVA, reported in Table 4, Panel A, show that \nthe multivariate main effect for Trial was statistically significant {F(2,156)=4.483, p<0.05} \nindicating that, overall, there was a statistically significant change in students\u2019 approaches to \nlearning between Trial 1 and Trial 2.   \n<insert Table 4 here> \nIn order to examine separately changes in students\u2019 deep and surface learning approaches \nbetween Trial 1 and Trial 2, two univariate paired sample t-tests were conducted. Results of the \ntests, reported in Table 3, show that the mean deep approach score increased from 42.89 to 43.79 \nacross the semester.  The increase in the deep approach score of 0.91 is small5, but statistically \nsignificant (p < 0.05). The mean surface approach score decreased from 47.61 to 46.24 across the \nsemester. The decrease in the surface learning approach score of -1.37 is small, but statistically \nsignificant (p < 0.05).  The results of the univariate tests reveal a statistically significant change \nin both the deep and surface approach to learning scores between Trial 1 and Trial 2.  Thus, the \n19 \nsignificant mulitivariate main effect for Trial is due to both an increase in the deep approach to \nlearning and a decrease in the surface approach to learning.   \nChanges in students\u2019 motive and strategy subscale scores were also examined to understand \nwhether the changes in students\u2019 approaches to learning scores were due to changes in their \nmotives and\/or strategies for studying.  Table 3 reports the mean motive and strategy subscale \nscores for the deep and surface learning approaches at Trial 1 and Trial 2. For the deep approach, \nboth the mean motive and strategy subscale scores increased from Trial 1 to Trial 2, consistent \nwith the overall increase in students\u2019 deep approach to learning. However, only the mean increase \nof 0.61 for the deep-strategy subscale was statistically significant (p < 0.05). For the surface \napproach, both the mean motive and strategy subscale scores decreased from Trial 1 to Trial 2, \nconsistent with the overall decrease in students\u2019 surface approach to learning. However, only the \nmean decrease of \u20130.93 for the surface-motive subscale was statistically significant (p < 0.05). \nThe implications of these results are considered in the discussion section.  \nRobustness Tests \nPast research suggests that some groups of students may be more receptive than others to \nlearning environments designed to change approaches to learning. In models of student learning, \nthe learning environment is only one factor influencing the approaches to learning adopted by \nstudents. Other factors, such as students\u2019 demographics, background, and previous educational \nexperiences, may also influence their learning approaches (Biggs, 1987a; Ramsden, 1992). \nTherefore, it is important to consider variation in background and experiences of different groups \nof students as possible influences on the impact of the learning environment on their approaches \nto learning. In this study, the effects of age, gender, general academic ability and prior accounting \n20 \nperformance are considered in order to examine the effect of other factors on students\u2019 \napproaches to learning. Biggs (1987a) argued that older students are more likely to adopt deep \nlearning approaches and less likely to utilise surface approaches to learning. Similarly, \nBiggs (1978) and Biggs and Moore (1993) argue that prior academic ability and general \nintelligence may influence students\u2019 approaches to learning. In addition, recent studies in the \naccounting literature have reported significant differences in learning approach scores between \nmales and females (Booth et al., 1999).  \nA multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was conducted to examine the effect of \nthese factors.  \u2206SURFACE and \u2206DEEP were entered as dependent variables, with age, general \nacademic ability, prior accounting performance, and gender entered as independent variables.6 As \nshown in Table 4, Panel B, the within-subjects effect of Trial is marginally significant \n{F(2,76)=2.741, p<0.10}. The reduction in the statistical significance of the Trial effect may be \nattributable to the reduced sample size available for this test (n=82 versus n=158 for the full \nsample results).  Analysis of the results for the between-subject factors shows a statistically \nsignificant effect for general academic ability {F(2,76)=4.374, p<0.05} and a marginally \nsignificant effect for age {F(2,76)=3.086, p<0.10}.  \nUnivariate tests using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were conducted to further analyse \nthe effect of general academic ability and age on changes in the approaches to learning scores.  \nWith \u2206SURFACE as the dependent variable, results from two separate ANCOVAs reveals \nstatistically significant effects for general academic ability {F(1,80)=7.736, p<0.01}7 and for \nage {F(1,80)=6.103, p<0.05}.8  With \u2206DEEP as the dependent variable, results from two separate \nANCOVAs reveals that the effects of general academic ability {F(1,80)=0.028, p>0.10} and \nage {F(1,80)=0.006, p>0.10} are not statistically significant.  Thus, the effects of general \n21 \nacademic ability and age on changes in approaches to learning scores relate to the surface \napproach only.   \nThe number of students with responses to the full set of independent variables is small (n=82) \nrelative to the full data set (n=158).  This is due to only 82 students having ENTER scores \navailable, the proxy for general academic ability.  Given the reduced sample size for these tests, it \nwas considered desirable to perform the robustness tests using a much larger proportion of the \nfull sample of students.  As such, the tests were re-run excluding general academic ability.  149 \nstudents had data available for the variables of age, gender and prior accounting performance.  \nThe results of this analysis are shown in Table 4, Panel C.  \nThe within-subjects effect of Trial is statistically significant {F(2,144)=4.968, p<0.01}. \nConsistent with the results shown in Table 4, Panel B, the effects of prior accounting \nperformance and gender are not statistically significant (p>0.10).  The marginally significant \nresult for age reported in Panel B is now insignificant. Therefore, the results of the robustness \ntests indicate that, with the exception of general academic ability, the overall change in students\u2019 \napproaches to learning scores are not influenced by the age, prior accounting performance or \ngender of students.   \nContrary to prior research, in the complete sample, age was not related to students\u2019 choice of \nlearning approach. However, the student cohort studying this subject consists largely of students \nadmitted to university immediately following completion of secondary school. This is supported \nby the mean age of the sample of 19.43 years.  In addition, the standard deviation of 1.21 \nindicates that there was comparatively little variation in age across the sample.  \n22 \nOverall, the results show that, collectively, students changed their approaches to learning between \nTrial 1 and Trial 2.  Consistent with the aims of the changes to the learning environment, the \noverall change in students\u2019 approach to learning scores was due to a small, but statistically \nsignificant, increase in students\u2019 deep approach scores and small, but statistically significant, \ndecrease in their surface approach scores. These results were independent of students\u2019 age, \ngender, general academic ability (except for the surface approach) and prior accounting \nperformance. The results of these tests provide some assurance that the changes in students\u2019 \napproaches to learning were not driven by students\u2019 demographics, background or prior \neducational experiences.  \nDISCUSSION \nResults of the study show that the introduction of three types of group activity (weekly group \nproblem solving exercises, group presentations and two group assignments) as part of a first-year \nundergraduate accounting subject were associated with an increase in students\u2019 deep approach to \nlearning and a decrease in students\u2019 surface approach to learning. This provides a positive signal \nto accounting educators about the possible effects of changes to the learning environment on \nstudents\u2019 approaches to learning. The changes to the learning environment to encourage deep \napproaches to learning are consistent with suggestions by the AECC (1990) about the use of \ngroup work and unstructured problem solving exercises, and with suggestions that the learning \nenvironment is a critical factor influencing the approach students take to learning (Gow et al., \n1994; Sharma, 1997, Lucas, 2001). Despite this positive signal, we cannot conclude that the \nchanges in the learning environment caused the changes in students\u2019 approaches to learning. \nNevertheless, there was an observed, but slight, change in students\u2019 approaches to learning at the \nsame time as group problem-solving activities were introduced into the tutorial program.  \n23 \nPrior results showed that accounting students\u2019 use of surface approaches to learning was higher \nthan students from other disciplines (Eley, 1992; Booth et al., 1999), and their use of deep \napproaches to learning declined throughout university (Gow et al., 1994). The seemingly small \nincrease in deep, and small decrease in surface, scores should be interpreted in light of prior \nresults showing the opposite trend for accounting students across the period of their instruction. \nResults reported in this study indicate that accounting educators can influence students\u2019 learning \napproaches by adopting specific changes in the learning environment. The results are also \nconsistent with evidence in accounting (Gow et al., 1994) and other disciplines (Busato et al., \n1998; Zeegers, 2001) that students\u2019 approaches to learning do change over time. However, unlike \nprevious research that has examined changes in students\u2019 learning approaches in the \u2018normal\u2019 \nuniversity learning environment, this study reports evidence on changes in students\u2019 learning \napproaches surrounding specific changes in the learning environment designed to encourage deep \napproaches to learning.  \nAs indicated in table 3, the increase in students\u2019 deep approach to learning appears primarily to \nbe due to an increase in their use of deep strategies, which might include things such as reading \nwidely, searching for relationships, and integrating with previous knowledge, rather than any \nincrease in their intrinsic interest in the subject. In contrast, the decrease in students\u2019 surface \napproach appears primarily to be due to a decrease in their motive to meet subject requirements \nminimally, rather than a reduction in their use of surface strategies, such as memorization and \nreproduction.  \nThe results reveal that students increased their use of deep strategies but did not significantly \nreduce their use of surface strategies. This may appear contrary to expectations as it may be \nexpected that the changes in the learning environment may reduce students\u2019 reliance on surface \n24 \nstrategies. However, the results appear consistent with the arguments of Birkett and \nMladenovic (2002), as students need not reduce their use of lower-level strategies (for example, \nrote learning, paraphrasing) when adopting a deep approach. Further, in some learning contexts, \nlower level strategies (as measured by the surface strategy score in the SPQ) are required in order \nto progress to higher levels of understanding. In accounting, students first must learn \nterminology, basic concepts and procedures before being able to apply knowledge to novel \nproblems and reflect\/evaluate on the appropriateness of various treatments and methods. The \nresults of this study appear to indicate that the changes in the tutorial program were associated \nwith an increase in students\u2019 use of deep strategies, without changing their use of lower-level \nlearning strategies as measured by the SPQ surface strategy score. Emphasis was placed in \ntutorial exercises and assignments on linking problems to prior knowledge and integrating \naspects of the subject. For example, in the topics on financial statement analysis, students were \nrequired to consider the effects of different accounting policy choices (for example, capitalisation \nof leases), which were discussed earlier in the semester, on their interpretations and conclusions \nregarding the financial structure of entities being studied. However, at the same time, students \nwere still required to learn ratio formulas and procedures necessary to conduct the analysis. Thus, \nsuccessful completion of these tasks required students to use strategies measured by the surface \nand deep strategy scales of the SPQ, which appears to be reflected in the changes in students\u2019 \nstrategy subscale scores.  \nResults for the motive subscales showed a decrease in students\u2019 surface-motive subscale scores, \nhowever, the change in students\u2019 deep-motive subscale scores was not statistically significant. \nTherefore, although the changes in the subject did not improve students\u2019 intrinsic interest in the \nmaterial, it appears to have changed their perceptions of their motives for studying the subject to \n25 \nthe extent that they were no longer merely to \u2018get through\u2019. Overall, it appears that the changes in \nthe subject were more successful at encouraging students to adopt deep strategies in their study \ncompared to generating an intrinsic interest in the subject. Increasing students\u2019 intrinsic interest \nmay take longer than a semester and may require specific changes designed to generate personal \ninterest and meaning for the students.  \nCONCLUDING COMMENTS \nThe purpose of this paper was to describe changes made to the learning environment of a first-\nyear accounting subject and to assess the impact these changes may have had on the approaches \nto learning adopted by accounting students. Results of the study provide some support for the \nability of accounting educators to influence students\u2019 approaches to learning. Results show \nstatistically significant, but small, increases in accounting students\u2019 deep approach to learning \nand statistically significant, but small, decreases in their surface approach to learning during the \nsemester. With one exception, the effect of the learning environment on students\u2019 approaches to \nlearning appears to be independent of student age, gender, academic ability or prior accounting \nperformance. Overall, the study provides some preliminary evidence on the ability of accounting \neducators to change accounting students\u2019 approaches to learning through specific changes to the \nlearning environment.  \nA limitation of this study is that despite examining the influence of factors, such as age, gender, \nacademic ability and prior accounting performance, there may be other factors that contributed to \nthe change in students\u2019 learning approaches that were not included in the study. A further \nlimitation is that effects of individual teachers on results have not been assessed. \n26 \nThe results provide evidence of a statistically significant change in students\u2019 approaches to \nlearning. Further research is needed to determine whether students perceived any useful change \nin the way they approached their learning tasks in the subject. Qualitative research, perhaps using \nin-depth interviews with accounting students, may be needed to determine how changes in the \nlearning environment affect the way students approach their learning tasks.  \nAlso, the study did not examine whether the changes in students\u2019 approaches to learning were \nrelated to improvements in their academic performance. Prior research using accounting students \nhas presented mixed evidence concerning the relationship between deep learning approaches and \nacademic performance (Eley, 1992; Booth et al., 1999; Davidson, 2002). Future research could \nexamine whether students improve their academic performance after adopting deep approaches to \nstudy.  \n \n \n27 \nReferences \nAccounting Education Change Commission (AECC) (1990) Objectives of education for \naccountants: Position statement number one, Issues in Accounting Education, 5(2), 307-312. \nBeattie, V., Collins, B., and McInnes, B.

As \nsuch, for the results in Panel B and Panel C, unequal cell sizes should not impact the sensitivity of the statistical tests \nof group differences (Hair et al. 1998) \n \n34 \n \n                                                          \n1 While the deep and surface approaches to learning characterise the way that students engage with a task, they do \nnot describe how students organise themselves to complete the task. Biggs (1987a) proposed the achieving approach \nto learning, which describes how students organise time and space to obtain the highest grades, whether or not the \nmaterial is interesting. This learning approach is based on competition and ego enhancement (Biggs, 1987a; 1989; \nBiggs and Moore, 1993; Beattie et al., 1997; Booth et al., 1999). Students\u2019 approach (deep versus surface) may \ninteract with the way students organise their time to complete the task. For example, a student may rote-learn in an \norganised way (surface and achieving approaches) or search for meaning in an organised way (deep and achieving \napproaches) (Biggs, 1987a). The achieving approach has received relatively little attention in Biggs recent \nwork (Birkett and Mladenovic, 2002).  \n2 The tutorial program was designed to enhance students\u2019 deep approach to learning and to discourage a surface \napproach to learning. Consequently, the study only examines changes in deep and surface learning approaches, not \nthe achieving approach. See Biggs (1987b) and Booth et al. (1999) for further details regarding the calculation of \nlearning approach scores. \n3 After completion of their final year of secondary education in the State of Victoria, students are awarded a score out \nof 100 representing their percentile rank relative to other students applying to enter tertiary education from secondary \nschool in that State. Tertiary entrance scores have been used to proxy academic ability in prior studies (Farley and \nRamsay 1988; Rohde and Kavanagh 1996). Also, most students undertaking the subject enter university directly \nfrom secondary school therefore their tertiary entrance score is a timely measure of their academic ability. Of the \navailable sample, only 82 had an ENTER score available. \n4 There is a statistically significant correlation between \u2206SURFACE and \u2206DEEP (r = 0.286, p < 0.01).  As such, a \nmultivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is required to control the overall Type I error rate.   \n5 The effect size was calculated as (Trial 2 mean \u2013 Trial 1 mean)\/Trial 1 SD (Cohen 1977).  This produces an effect \nsize of 0.125 and -0.183 for the overall deep approach and overall surface approach, respectively.  Both effect sizes \nare between 0.10 and 0.39 and thus are considered small.   \n6 The continuous between-subject factors of age, general academic ability, and prior accounting performance were \nmodelled as covariates, with gender modelled as a 2-level between-subjects factor.  \n35 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n7 To further understand the significant between-subjects effect of general academic ability, the sample was split at \nthe mean of general academic ability, with students reporting a tertiary entrance score above the mean categorised as \n\u201chigh ability\u201d and students below the mean categorised as \u201clow ability\u201d. Results of paired sample t-tests reveals a \nmarginally significant increase in the surface approach score of 2.36 for high ability students (t=1.579, p < 0.10), and \na significant decrease in the surface approach of 4.25 for low ability students (t=2.768, p < 0.05). Thus, the \nstatistically significant between-subjects effect of general academic ability is due to those students with higher \ngeneral academic ability increasing their surface approach score, with those of lower general academic ability \ndecreasing their surface approach score. This appears somewhat contrary to expectations as Biggs (1978) and Biggs \nand Moore (1993) argued that students of lower academic ability are more likely to adopt a surface approach. \nHowever, a comparison of the learning approach scores for different levels of academic ability in this sample may \nnot be particularly useful as none of the students would be considered of low academic ability in terms of the general \nstudent population.  \n8 To further understand the significant between-subjects effect of age, the sample was split at the mean age (18.87 \nyears) and paired sample t-tests performed.  Results show a decrease in the surface approach score of 4.05 (t=1.337, \np > 0.10) for younger students and an increase in the surface approach of 0.34 for older students (t=0.299, p > 0.10). \nHowever, the change in surface approach scores is not statistically significant for either group of students.   \n"}
