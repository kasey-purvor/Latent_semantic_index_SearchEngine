A comparison\nbetween distance and face-to-face learners using\ne-learning materials\nSara de Freitas and Gerald R Roberts\nBirkbeck, University of London\nemail: S.deFreitas@bbk.ac.uk; Gerald.roberts@ud.pc.uk\nThis study compares continual assessment data, intake numbers, retention numbers and\nfinal examination grades of a mixed cohort of face-to-face and distance learners against\nsimilar data from previous years where e-learning materials were not used in order to test\nwhether e-learning materials can support the same quality and quantity of teaching and\nlearning for both face-to-face and distance learners. The results for this cohort of\nlearners demonstrate that: (i) distance e-learners score as well and sometimes better\nthan face-to-face learners; (ii) face-to-face student numbers have increased; (iii)\noverall, student retention and student attendance have been maintained; (iv) final\nexamination results have been maintained or in some cases improved; (v) lecturer\nworkload was high, but not unmanageable, and it is clear how manageability can be\nimproved.\nIntroduction\nBirkbeck College was an early advocate of distance learning and the use of ICT\n(Information and Communications Technology) to support student learning, provide\ndistance learning courses (fourteen courses are currently offered for distance learners\nincluding four through the University of London External Programme), provide online\nlearning (Moss and Sansom, 2000), and use e-learning in courses more generally (School of\nCrystallography; School of Biological and Chemical Sciences and School of Computer\nScience and Information Systems).\nProviding e-learning materials are embedded into course work with due consideration of\npedagogy, context and learner requirements, the benefits of using e-learning to support\n69\nSara de Freitas and Gerald P. Roberts Does distance e-learning work?\ndistance learners - or distance e-learning in this article - may provide greater flexibility for\nthe learner (Cullen, Hadjivassiliou, Hamilton, Kelleher, Sommerlad and Stern, 2002;\nReynolds, Caley and Mason, 2002). In particular, electronic course materials may offer\nbenefits including ease of access by students 'anywhere and anytime' (DfES, 2003).\nThere is a range of literature that explores the factors such as motivation levels and\nretention that affect learning at a distance or for online learning (see Inglis, 2000; Collis\nand Moonen, 2001; Eisenstadt and Vincent, 2000; Stephenson, 2001). Adding to this work,\nthis paper focuses upon whether greater flexibility is compatible with high quality of\nlearning provision in the absence of face-to-face contact between tutor and students with a\nparticular reference to retention and completion rates.\nIn the face of the growth in the numbers of distance learners in the United Kingdom from\n150,000 in 1996\/7 to 200,000 in 2000\/1 (source: HESA), and indeed the pressure which\nmany institutions are under to increase student numbers, many are turning to e-learning\nmaterials to support distance learning. While there is a significant body of work conducted\nin the United States that has found 'no significant difference' between 'technology-based\ninstruction' and face-to-face learning in terms of learner outcomes (for example, Russell,\n2001), there have been few similar studies in the United Kingdom. This article attempts to\ntest the hypothesis that distance e-learning can maintain or increase the quality and\nquantity of teaching in a United Kingdom institution. The paper provides new\nquantitative data to allow comparison of the two forms of learning (distance and face-to-\nface) with a single cohort of students, providing a comparison between: (1) numbers\nattending, (2) retention numbers, (3) continual assessment grades, and (4) final\nexamination grades. In order to provide a control for the study, wherever possible the paper\ncompares this single cohort with cohorts from previous years where no electronic teaching\nmaterial was used.\nThe e-content used for distance e-learning at the School of Earth Sciences included a range\nof digital materials:\n\u2022 full-text documents;\n\u2022 supporting materials;\n\u2022 high-quality graphical materials (including photos, diagrams and movies with sound);\n\u2022 interactive links to course schedules;\n\u2022 links to online resources; and\n\u2022 links to other lecture notes in the series.\nThe distance e-learning materials were created using Adobe Acrobat Writer\u2122 which\nfacilitated authoring of PDF files from other electronic media. In addition, whilst\nconnected to the Web, students can access the electronic library, email and other Web\nresources using buttons placed on the PDF files. Due to the central mission of Birkbeck to\nreach people who work during the day, accessibility was a key issue in the mode of delivery\nof the materials; therefore e-learning materials were made available on CD-ROMs. This\nfacilitated inclusion of high-quality photographs allowing the student to magnify images\nto study relevant details, just as a face-to-face student might magnify a specimen using a\nmicroscope or climb a hill to gain an overview of a geological scene.\n70\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 3\nThe course material was provided to both face-to-face and distance learning students. To\nensure that students received weekly feedback, a feature that was thought to be particularly\nrelevant for distance learning students, the final examination requirements for the year\n2001-2 were changed from previous years. Previously, final examinations consisted of a\ntheoretical and practical examination. In 2001-2 the practical examinations were replaced\nby weekly-assessed practical tests - the marks from these were returned within three weeks\n(except in the case of one course to allow evaluation of the effect of this facility; see\nbelow).\nThree half-course units and one full-course unit from the B.Sc. Geology and B.Sc.\nEnvironmental Geology were offered with CD-ROM lecture material for the first time in\n2001-2; the courses were also offered for distance learners for the first time. These four\ncourses have been evaluated in this project in order to provide data to find out whether\ndistance e-learning can maintain high-quality learning and whether e-learning materials\nare beneficial to both distance learners and face-to-face learners.\nThe following courses were examined.\n\u2022 Introduction to Geology; (1.0 course unit: 20 lectures and practicals) complete on five\nCD-ROMs. Assessed work was marked each week and returned to the students with a\nprovisional mark.\n\u2022 Structural Geology 1; (0.5 course unit: 10 lectures and practicals) complete on one CD-\nROM. Assessed work was marked each week and returned to the students with a\nprovisional mark.\n\u2022 Structural Geology 2; (0.5 course unit: 10 lectures and practicals) complete on two CD-\nROMs. Assessed work was marked each week and returned to the students with a\nprovisional mark.\n\u2022 Global Tectonics; (0.5 course unit: 10 lectures and practicals) complete on one CD-\nROM. Assessed work was returned at the end of the course. The same students studied\nboth this course and Structural Geology 2.\nAvailable data for these courses consists of entry numbers, attendance records and marks\nachieved by students.\nMethod\nThe method used to evaluate the mixed cohort of learners consisted of a graphical analysis\nof trends in the data.\n(1) To investigate the quality and quantity of teaching and learning across the cohort, the\nfollowing is presented:\n\u2022 the number of students for several years of intake is compared;\n\u2022 the retention rates of students for several years of intake are compared;\n\u2022 a general survey of student entry comments made at admissions interview for a sub-set\nof the 2001-2 cohort is presented and analysed;\n\u2022 average marks for several years of final examination results are compared;\n71\nSara de Freitas and Gerald P. Roberts Does distance e-leaming work?\n\u2022 the distribution of marks for several years of final examinations is compared;\n\u2022 mark accumulation during assessed course work is analysed including differentiation\nbetween (a) students who had previous degree qualifications at intake, (b) those who\ndid not, and (c) distance learners;\n\u2022 a comparison of mark accumulation during assessed work and final examination\nresults for two course units, where one course included weekly feedback and one did\nnot; the same sub-set of the 2001-2 cohort took both courses.\n(2) To investigate whether there would be a decrease in face-to-face attendance if high-\nquality lecture notes and graphics are provided, the following is presented:\n\u2022 attendance records for several years of students are presented and analysed;\n\u2022 attendance records for students admitted in 2001-2 who stated at interview that they\nmay only attend sporadically (using the lecture notes provided on CD-ROM for\ndistance learning) are presented and analysed;\n\u2022 Finally, an analysis of lecturer workload will be presented, commenting on preparation\nof the e-learning materials and provision of feedback to the learners.\nDistance learning in Earth Sciences and the adopted method\nLearning in Earth Sciences specifically requires student access to high-quality\nvisualizations of the processes and products of geological evolution. It also requires the\ndevelopment of practical skills, which allow students to recognize and interact with varied\ngeological materials and geological scenarios. Traditionally, these have been provided by\nfieldwork and laboratory studies. Of these, fieldwork rightly remains the primary focus of\ngeological teaching (as specified by the benchmark statement for Earth Sciences,\nEnvironmental Sciences and Environmental Studies, and the need for 100 days of\nfieldwork during a B.Sc. Geology course to achieve accreditation and chartered geologist\nstatus within the Geological Society of London). Traditional laboratory studies have\nalways been regarded as essential because of the difficulty of delivering interactive\npractical scenarios with high-quality visualizations by any other method.\nHowever, the Web is increasingly providing a viable alternative for the delivery of high-\nquality materials, for example, the University of Leeds has delivered high-quality materials\nover the Web (see: http:llearth.leeds.ac.uk\/peoplelbutlerlcontents.htm). Due to the nature of\nthese large files, for example, a single photograph that is of sufficient quality to allow\nexamination at a variety of scales (as would be the case with a student increasing the\nmagnification of a microscope or climbing a hill to gain a different perspective on a\ngeological field scene) is at least 10Mb in size when converted to a digital form. In the past,\ndue to the slow download times for 56k modems, we considered that Web delivery impeded\nattempts at delivering geological laboratory-style studies for distance learning. However, in\nthe near future the Web may provide a valid alternative for delivering Earth Science\nmaterials; as the numbers of students with broadband connections at home increase, the\nmaterials that are currently offered via CD-ROM can be easily uploaded to the Internet,\nwhen ease of access for all students can be assured.\n72\nALT-] Volume I I Number 3\nA method has been developed whereby large file sizes can be delivered via CD-ROM using\na simple and freely available software package. Most computers can use Adobe Acrobat\nReader7*1 to read PDF files. This reader software is present on most computers at the time\nof purchase or can be downloaded free from the Adobe Website. The user does not have to\nbe connected to the Web to access lecture material and could be using a laptop anywhere.\nHowever, when connected, links allow easy access to the Web. The file sizes can be as large\na several hundred megabytes for multipage lecture notes (the size of CD-ROM) yet access\nspeeds are a few seconds for a page containing four 10Mb photos plus text.\nAdobe Acrobat Writer\u2122 allows an author to add 'interactive buttons' to lecture notes\nwhich permits the student to open Web-links to electronic libraries or staff homepages,\nopen files, go to specific pages in files, play movies and zoom in on photos and diagrams,\nconduct searches for words and display thumbnails to the pages of lecture notes. When\nprinted the page format is controlled by the author rather than by the particular browser\nsoftware chosen by the student. This allows the lecturer to control the exact format of\nprinted pages seen by the student. The software allows inclusion of full colour graphics, is\neasy to use and compresses file-sizes to a minimum. A standard but individual 'house style'\ncan be developed with ease to standardize lecture note styles from individual\ndepartments\/institutions. The files have been placed onto CD-ROMs using a CD multi-\ncopier purchased for this purpose by the School of Earth Sciences. The CD-ROMs are\ngiven to distance learning and face-to-face students as part of the normal course with no\nextra fee.\nThe practical material for the four courses studied in the project was developed over a\nconsiderable period. In total the materials took about 175 days to develop; this was spread\nover a period of about four years. This broke down into:\n\u2022 twenty days to research and write the text for each 0.5 course unit;\n\u2022 thirty days to draw appropriate diagrams on computer for each 0.5 course unit;\n\u2022 five days to scan appropriate photographs for each 0.5 course unit;\n\u2022 fifteen days to paste the text, diagrams and photographs into the house format PDF file\nand to make the electronic links, buttons and interactive features for 0.5 course unit.\nResults\nComparison of students intake for the years 1993-2001\nTo assess whether the introduction of e-learning materials influences student numbers, the\nnumber of students entering single honours B.Sc. Geology is plotted in Figure 1. After a\ndecrease in student numbers following 1993 when many oil companies moved offices out of\nthe London area following a change in taxation on oil exploration in the North Sea,\nstudent numbers enrolling for Introduction to Geology were between nine and seventeen.\nCD-ROM lecture material was advertised and offered for the first time in 2001. Intake rose\nin October 2001 to thirty-six, a number which included seven distance learning students.\nThe total number of students entering the School of Earth Sciences in the year 2001-2 was\nfifty-three, a number which included students studying for joint honours degrees.\n73\nSara de Freitas and Gerald P.

There is no clear pattern of increased or decreased retention over the period\nstudied. However, it is noted that retention was worse in the year following introduction of\ne-learning material than in the previous four years, but similar to that of five years\npreviously.\nFigure 2: Percentage net taking Intio to Geology Bam\nc\nu\u00a9\nQ.\n40 -\n20 -\n0 - n n\" 1 dm 1\n1993 1994 1995 1935 1997 1993 1959 2CQ0 2001\nYear\nMa clear paitafn emerges ccncairing stutlsrr.3 who took Std fnal \u20223eok:-S'y sx\nFor the intake of 2001 into Introduction to Geology, the percentage of students who took\nthe final examination was similar for face-to-face and distance learners (see Figures 3a and\nb). However, the percentage of face-to-face learners who left the college was about double\nthat of the distance learners (see Figure 3c). Thus, although both face-to-face and distance\nlearners enrol and then do not take the final examination, a larger proportion of distance\nlearning students in this sample remained with the college, deferring examinations to a\nlater time compared with face-to-face students.\n74\noita\nn\nc3 .\n0\n?\n rt\n= J-'\n; o o\n1 U 1.1\nJ U.

The students include occasional, non-degree students and joint honours students\nin addition to the mixed cohort of single honours face-to-face and distance-learners\ndescribed above. The results are presented in the Table 1.\nCourse Intake number\nBSc Geology . 29\nDistance learning 10\nBSc Environmental Science\/Physical Sciences\/\nGeology and Physics 8\nNon degree\/occasional 4\nBSc Environmental Geology 2\n53 in total\nTable I: Intake number across the courses\nSummaries of the findings are as follows.\n\u2022 Seventeen students already had degrees out of fifty-three (32 per cent).\n\u2022 The average age of students was thirty-five.\n\u2022 Twenty-five of the students said they had never heard of Birkbeck, but found the\ncollege on the Web.\n\u2022 Ten students (who are not distance learners) said they were especially attracted by the\nuse of e-learning material; nine of these would not have come to the School of Earth\nSciences without CD-ROM material and all nine of these enrolled for the B.Sc.\nGeology.\nThe most notable finding is that nine students indicated that they would not have enrolled\nwithout the provision of e-learning material. This was due to the expectation that they\nwould use the distance learning option as a safety net if they could not attend all the\nlectures. Thus, these nine students together with the ten students who enrolled for distance\nlearning, increased the student numbers by nineteen (36 per cent of the total intake of\nfifty-three) as a direct result of provision of e-learning material.\nComparison of average marks at final examination for the years 1994-2002\nTo assess whether the e-learning material helps to maintain the quality of teaching and\nlearning, as evidenced by final examination results, data for the years 1994-2002 were\ncompared (the results for the year 1995 are not available and Structural Geology 2 and\nGlobal Tectonics run every second year, see Figure 4). The examination results for 2002 in\nIntroduction to Geology showed the highest mean percentage on record. The examination\nresults for 2002 in Structural Geology 1 showed the second highest mean percentage on\nrecord. The examination results for 2002 in Structural Geology 2 showed the second\nhighest mean percentage on record. Marks for Global Tectonics were similar to previous\nyears. External examiners confirmed there was no difference in the level of examinationss\nfor these years.\n76\nALT-J Volume 11 Number 3\nDistribution of average marks at final examination for the years 1994-2002\nTo assess whether the e-learning material helps to maintain the quality of teaching and\nlearning, as evidenced by distribution of final examination results, data for the years\n1994-2002 were compared (the results for the year 1995 are not available and Structural\nGeology 2 and Global Tectonics run every second year, see Figure 5). It was judged that\ntoo little data was available for analysis using histograms so the standard deviation of the\nresults was analysed. The examination results for all four courses show no clear pattern of\nvariation in standard deviation.\nMark accumulation through time during assessed course work\nTo assess whether continual assessment associated with e-learning material influences\nachievement as evidenced by accumulated marks, the cumulative marks scored by students\nthrough time are presented (see Figure 6).\nOverall findings of the study on the Introduction to Geology showed:\n\u2022 there was no obvious difference in achievement between those with or without a degree\nupon entry;\n\u2022 distance learners have a high drop-out rate, but can achieve first-class marks;\n\u2022 the single first-class student improved with time evidenced by a better fit to the data\nusing a second-order polynomial than with a linear equation. However, this highlights\none of the few examples of clear improvement associated with continual assessment\nand weekly feedback;\n\u2022 most students who do not drop out follow linear learning curves, in some cases\ninterrupted by flat portions to the curve caused by not handing in some assess-\nments;\n\u2022 the lack of upwardly concave curves, which would indicate improvement in\nachievement through time, may be due to several factors:\ni. the early practicals may be too easy compared with abilities of the students\n(although external examiners state that the assignments are appropriate for\nthis stage of a B.Sc. Geology);\nii. the later practicals may be too difficult compared with abilities of the students\n(although external examiners state that the assignments are appropriate for\nthis stage of a B.Sc. Geology);\niii. students were not trying as hard in later practicals;\niv. upward concavity may be hidden in stepped curves associated with not\nhanding in practicals.\nThe results of the Structural Geology 1 course are presented in Figure 7.

However,\nStructural Geology 2 assessed work each week, which was marked and marks were handed\nback each week. Global Tectonics assessed work each week, but the marks were only\nreturned at the end of the course. The results (Figures 4 and 8) show that:\n\u2022 ten out of eleven students achieved better marks in Structural Geology 2 during\nassessed work;\n\u2022 in terms of final marks, the mean mark in 2002 for Structural Geology 2 was 60 per\ncent (Standard Deviation 14 per cent) with a mean of 57 per cent for Global Tectonics\n(Standard Deviation 20 per cent); (see Figure 4).\nThe above may indicate that handing back marks each week improves learning evidenced\nby marks achieved during assessed work. Alternatively, it may indicate that the practieals\nin Structural Geology 2 were easier than in Global Tectonics - although external\nexaminers did not confirm this. The final examination results were not distinguishable for\nthe two courses, indicating that marking and returning assessed work each week has not\nhad an obvious effect in terms of increasing final marks.\nAttendance records for the years 2000-2001 and 2001-2002\nTo test whether provision of e-learning material affected attendance, records for the years\n2000-1 and 2001-2 are compared in detail for the course Introduction to Geology (see\nFigure 9); less detailed analysis of the other three courses is also included (see Figure 10).\n80\nFigure aa\nSi 800\n% 600\nI 4t>0\n\"\u00a7 200\n3 o\n\u2022 Strut 2\na Global\nTectonics\n5\nPraclfcal\n10\nFlguie Bb\n400\nZQO\n\u00a3l\n\u2022 Etruc 2\n\u00ab Global\nTectonics\n0 S\nPiactlcal\n10\nFlguta Be\n800\nGOO\n400\n200\n0\n! & \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 Strue 2\nt) Global\nTectonics\n10\nPractical\nFlguiefid\n'fe 800\n| 600\nI 400\n00\n0\nStruc 2\nTectonics\n0 5\nPractical\n10\nFigure Se Flguie Bf Figure Figure fill\nJ\n* Struc 2\ns Gicbst\nTectonics\n600\n400\n200\n0\n\u2022 Struc 2\nu Global\nTectonics\nBOO\n600\n400\n200\n0\n\u2022 Struc 2\nEI Global\nTectonics\n\u2022 Struc 2\n5\nPractical\n10 5\nPiactlcal\nH 1000\nE 800\n| 600\nJ! 400\n1 200\n3 0\nA\n\u2022 Struc 2\nH Global\nTectonics\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n\u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 Struc 2\nH Global\nTectonics\n0 5\nPractical\n10 S\nPractical\n10\nFt] lire sk\n| 800\n\u00ab 600\nS 400\n1 200\n3 o\n\u2022 Struc 2\nH Global\nTectonics\n5\nPractical\nThe aa\/ne students took Structural Geaiogy 2 and Glcfcil TeetuiJes.\nStructural Cijulcvjry 2 Had assessed work eadi Meek wtilcli was marked and tiaiiderj bitk nltli a n-iirk eatfi meek.\nQoLiat Tectaiilfs Juul assessed noik eaai week but the maiks were only returned &i the end of the course.\n10 out ot 11 5tu<tata actileved better marks In stiuciural Geology 2.\nTh\u00a3 may Indcaie that llantltig back niaiks thdi week impruves learning.\nAlternatively, It may HMtcate ihat the practitali In structural Geology 2 were easier titan In Global Teutonics althciu(fi this via* not uancinntd by external: exarvJuas.\nSara de Freitas and Gerald P.

The average weekly attendance is 12.2 (61 per cent)\nfor 2000-1 and 12.5 (63 per cent) for 2001-2.\nA comparison for the years 2000-1 and 2001-2 for all four courses shows that in terms of\npercentage weeks attended there is little difference between the same courses run in the\nyears 2000-1 and 2001-2, with two courses showing an increased percentage and two\ncourses showing a decreased percentage (see Figure 10).\nAttendance records for students with sporadic attendance\nAn assessment has been made of whether students who anticipated at interview that they\nwould use the distance learning option in part actually behaved in this manner (see Figure\n11). For the eight students who anticipated using the distance learning option in part and\nattended at least part of the course, two of the four who completed the course show flat\nportions to their curves indicating non-attendance.

Two of the eight\nstudents attended all the lectures. Thus, half of the students who indicated at interview that\nthey would attend sporadically due to provision of e-learning material, attended every week.\nLecturer workload\nIn the October-December term the following courses ran: Introduction to Geology;\nGlobal Tectonics; Structural Geology 2. In the January-March term the following courses\nran: Introduction to Geology; Structural Geology 1. Grading the assessment provided a\nlarge proportion of the allocated teaching time. It was found that grading and providing\nstudent feedback took about one day per week for each course. Thus three days per week\nwere spent marking in the first term and two days per week in the second term.\nFurther time was spent on the enrolment and administration of the distance learners,\nincluding setting up a Website for advertising purposes. An email, feedback service for\nstudents was run and widely advertised. Although it was expected that an email feedback\nservice would provide the main method of feedback to students and would be very time-\nconsuming, there were only two email queries in the whole year.\n84\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 3\nSummary of results and discussion\nThe provision of teaching and learning material in an electronic format produced the\nfollowing features:\n\u2022 an increased intake of students into the B.Sc. Geology course as it both allowed for the\nprovision of distance learners and increased the face-to-face student intake - due to\nincreased flexibility as perceived by the students;\n\u2022 no noticeable effect on the percentage of students who took the final examinations\nthrough the years 1994-2002;\n\u2022 sufficient quality ensuring that similar percentages of face-to-face and distance learners\ntook the final examination in the year 2001-2;\n\u2022 sufficient quality ensuring that a higher percentage of distance learning students were\nretained by the college to enter the following year compared with face-to-face students;\n\u2022 maintenance and in some cases an increase in the achievement of students at final\nexamination. This is supported by the fact that these materials were introduced in the\nyear prior to the highest examination mean percentage on record for Introduction to\nGeology and second highest for Structural Geology 1 and Structural Geology 2; but\nclearly longer-term data are desirable;\n\u2022 no noticeable effect on the distribution of final examination results around the mean\npercentage as evidenced by standard deviations (see Appendix 1);\n\u2022 no noticeable effect on weekly or total attendance evidenced by a comparison of\ncumulative attendance growth curves for Introduction to Geology and percentage\nattendance levels for the three other courses (see Appendix 1);\n\u2022 very limited non-attendance in a subset of students who indicated at the initial\ninterview that they anticipated utilizing the distance learning option in part even\nthough they were registered as face-to-face students;\n\u2022 a high workload, as it took 175 days over four years of a lecturers' time to author the e-\nlearning material;\n\u2022 assessed work was marked and returned on a weekly basis; findings from this showed\nno noticeable difference in terms of final assessed work marks or weekly accumulation\nrates for marks compared across students who (i) already had a degree prior to entry,\n(ii) no prior degree on entry, (iii) distance learners;\n\u2022 results from the assessment did not commonly produce concave upwards cumulative\nmark accumulation curves - indicative of weekly improvement in performance: most\nstudents followed linear mark accumulation curves although several other external\nfactors that have not been analysed may have contributed to this;\n\u2022 higher marks and steeper mark accumulation curves compared to a course where\nmarks were not returned each week although several other external factors that have\nnot been analysed may have contributed to this - final examination results were very\nsimilar for the two courses;\n85\nSaru de Freitos and Gerald P. Roberts Does distance e-learning work?\n\u2022 assessment conducted on a weekly basis took up fifty days of a lecturers' time out of a\nhundred days available (two terms of ten weeks) for research, administration and\nteaching;\n\u2022 overall, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that the provision of electronic\nmaterials to support teaching and learning can maintain the quality and quantity of\nteaching.\nMost notably, findings of the pilot project run showed that:\n\u2022 overall student numbers have increased;\n\u2022 student retention and student attendance have been maintained;\n\u2022 final examination results have been maintained or in some cases improved.\nOther benefits of providing electronic materials for the lecturer included:\n\u2022 better organization of the teaching materials;\n\u2022 time-saving in the long run for lecture preparation time, although assessed work\nproduced a high to unmanageable workload.\nOther notable aspects of the comparison include:\n\u2022 the benefits of weekly assessment were not borne out by any significant effect on\nstudent marks;\n\u2022 although email support was offered to the distance learners this was rarely used and did\nnot provide a significant aspect of the course tutors' interactions. It may be that the\nlarge amount of feedback given to students each week cut down on the feedback they\nrequired via email. It may be more time-effective to provide email feedback with\nanswers to the assignments provided on a separate CD-ROM. As a consequence\npractical examinations were reintroduced in the year 2002-3; practical work will now\nbe self-assessed with the answers provided on a separate CD-ROM.

The introduction of distance learning material has increased student\nnumbers. Our work provides a positive test of the hypothesis that distance e-learning can\nmaintain or increase the quality and quantity of teaching in a United Kingdom institution,\nproviding e-learning materials are well-considered, fit into the tutor's pedagogic approach\nand are clearly presented.\nReferences\nCollis, B. and Moonen, J.
