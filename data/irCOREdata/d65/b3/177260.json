Molecular signals regulating this process may\ncontribute to the repair outcome, chronic evolution and,\neventually, the onset of osteoarthritis. We tested the hypothesis\nthat mechanical injury modulates morphogenetic pathways in\nadult human articular cartilage explants. Adjacent articular\ncartilage explants were obtained from preserved areas of the\nfemoral condyles of patients undergoing arthroplasty for\nosteoarthritis, or from a normal joint of a patient undergoing\nlower limb amputation. Paired explants were individually\nmaintained in explant culture. From each pair, one explant was\nmechanically injured and the other left uninjured as a control.\nCultures were terminated at different time points for\nhistochemistry, immunohistochemistry and gene expression\nanalysis by reverse transcription real time PCR. Bone\nmorphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) mRNA was upregulated in\nthe injured explants. We detected phosphorylation of SMAD-1\nand SMAD-5, consistent with activation of the bone\nmorphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway. FRZB-1 mRNA was\ndownregulated in the injured explants, suggesting de-repression\nof WNT signaling. Accordingly, expression of the canonical\nWNT target genes Axin-2 and c-JUN was upregulated in the\ninjured explants. Activation of the canonical WNT signaling\npathway by LiCl treatment induced upregulation of COL2A1\nand Aggrecan mRNA, suggesting an anabolic effect.\nPhosphorylation of SMAD-1\/-5 and downregulation of FRZB\nwere confirmed in vivo in a mouse model of joint surface injury.\nTaken together, these data show modulation of the BMP and\nWNT pathways following mechanical injury in vitro and in vivo,\nwhich may play a role in the reparative response of the joint\nsurface. These pathways may, therefore, represent potential\ntargets in protocols of biological joint surface defect repair.\nIntroduction\nChronic symptomatic full thickness defects of the joint surface\nare commonly regarded to have a poor repair capacity. There-\nfore, surgical treatment is provided for symptomatic relief and\nin an attempt to avoid possible evolution towards osteoarthritis\n(OA) [1]. The natural history of acute full thickness joint sur-\nface defects (JSDs), however, is not yet well known. Scattered\nclinical and animal studies have suggested that acute full\nthickness JSDs exhibit potential for repair, which is dependent\non age, the size of the lesion, and biomechanical factors.\nIn two independent, long term, prospective studies, acute trau-\nmatic chondral lesions in young athletes had a good to excel-\nlent clinical outcome in 78% of the cases in the absence of\nspecific surgical treatments [2,3]. In addition, Koshino and col-\nleagues [4] reported significant regeneration of chronic JSDs\nassociated with genu varu at 2 years after correction of knee\nmalalignment by valgus osteotomy. Age dependent spontane-\nous repair has been reported in patients with osteochondritis\ndissecans [5]. Likewise, age dependent spontaneous repair of\nrelatively small experimental full thickness JSDs has been\nreported in rabbits [6,7] and dogs [8]. In rabbits, this repair\nprocess entails invasion of the fibrin clot, filling the defect byPage 1 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMP = bone morphogenetic protein; glycogen synthase kinase 3 = GSK-3; DAPI = 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; FBS = fetal bovine serum; JSD \n= joint surface defect; MMP = metalloproteinase; OA = osteoarthritis; Q-PCR = quantitative real time PCR; RT-PCR = reverse transcription PCR; \nTBST = tris buffered saline; TCF\/LEF = T-cell factor\/lymphoid enhancer factor.\nArthritis Research & Therapy    Vol 8 No 5    Dell'Accio et al.mesenchymal progenitors, chondrogenesis, and endochon-\ndral bone formation. Bone formation is polarized towards the\njoint surface, and preserves a layer of articular cartilage [6].\nAlthough the repair tissue is not always durable and advance-\nment of the bone front at the expense of stable articular carti-\nlage sometimes occurs, this repair process, under specific\nconditions, can restore joint surface homeostasis.\nThe patterning and morphogenesis that joint surface repair\nentails implies a stepwise cellular and molecular program.\nThus, failure of the signaling mechanisms governing this proc-\ness may be a factor contributing to a poor repair outcome.\nSuch signals may represent therapeutic targets to support\nspontaneous repair or complement existing biological joint\nresurfacing techniques.\nThe current surgical approaches for localized full thickness\nlesions of the joint surface are autologous chondrocyte\nimplantation, microfracture, and mosaicplasty. However, clini-\ncal outcomes suffer from some degree of variability [9-11]. In\naddition, there is still no satisfactory biological regeneration\nprotocol for non-localized lesions. An alternative or comple-\nmentary approach for joint tissue repair would be the control-\nled delivery of molecular signals to mesenchymal progenitors\nreported within the joint environment [12-18] with support of\nthe subsequent steps of repair, including proliferation, pattern-\ning, and differentiation in vivo.\nIn this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the adult\nhuman articular cartilage is a source of morphogenetic signals\nupon injury. To this end, we have used an in vitro model of\nFigure 1\nEx vivo model of mechanical injury to adult human articular cartilage explants. (a) Adjacent explants from human adult articular cartilage were dis-\nsected and placed in culture in separate bacteriological Petri dishes. After 6 days, 1 explant was injured.

In particular, we have focused on the bone morpho-\ngenetic protein (BMP) and the canonical WNT pathways,\nwhich are known to play a crucial role in joint morphogenesis\nand homeostasis as well as in repair processes [19-21].\nBMPs are secreted molecules belonging to the transforming\ngrowth factor \u03b2 superfamily of morphogens. Upon binding\ntheir ligands, BMP receptors phosphorylate the carboxy-termi-\nnal domain of SMAD-1, SMAD-5 and SMAD-8. Phosphor-\nylated SMADS translocate to the nucleus where they\nparticipate in the transcriptional regulation of target genes\n[20].\nWNTs constitute a large family of morphogens. WNT ligands\ntransduce their signal through different intracellular pathways.\nIn the \u03b2 catenin-dependent (canonical) pathway, in the\nabsence of WNT ligands, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-\n3) constitutively phosphorylates \u03b2 catenin, which then is\ndegraded through the proteasome pathway. When WNT lig-\nands bind to their receptors (called FRZD), GSK-3 is inhibited\nand \u03b2 catenin is, therefore, stabilized and accumulates in the\ncytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to\nmembers of the T-cell factor\/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF\/\nLEF) family of transcription factors, thereby activating tran-\nscription of target genes [22].\nMaterials and methods\nEx vivo cartilage injury model and tissue culture\nWell-preserved (modified Mankin score 5 or less) cartilage\nsamples were obtained from patients who underwent total\nknee replacement for unicompartmental OA (e.g., lateral con-\ndyle in genu varu). The average age was 67.5 \u00b1 8.9 years old\nand the study included 3 males and 5 females. In one case\n(male, 49 years old), we obtained cartilage explants from a\npatient who had undergone limb amputation due to a road traf-\nfic accident and was free from OA. In this case, therefore, the\ncartilage was considered normal. Paired adjacent explants of\napproximately 6 \u00d7 6 mm were maintained in culture in 4 ml of\nDulbecco's modeified Eagle's medium\/HAMF12 1:1 (Invitro-\ngen, Paisley, UK) in the presence or in the absence of 10%\nFBS (Invitrogen) and antibiotics\/antimycotics (Invitrogen) in\nindividual 33 mm bacteriological Petri dishes (BD Falcon\u2122,\nBD Biosciences, Le Pont De Claix, France). We used bacteri-\nological Petri dishes to avoid spreading of cells from the\nexplants. After 6 days, the medium was replaced and one of\neach pair of adjacent samples was cut using a scalpel at 1 mm\nintervals. The other explant of each pair was left uninjured (Fig-\nure 1a). At different time points, the explants were used for\nRNA extraction and one aliquot was processed for histology\nand immunohistochemistry.\nFor experiments investigating activation of the WNT\/\u03b2 catenin\ncanonical pathway by means of LiCl treatment, the explants\nwere maintained for 6 days in complete culture medium con-\ntaining 10 mM NaCl. At the end of this period, the explants\nwere either switched to medium containing 10 mM LiCl or, for\ncontrol explants, the medium was replaced with fresh medium\ncontaining 10 mM NaCl. The experiments were then termi-\nnated after one day. All procedures received approval from the\nlocal ethics committee.\nRNA extraction, reverse transcription PCR and \nquantitative real time RT-PCR\nCartilage samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, pow-\ndered with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen, and subse-\nquently homogenized in Trizol reagent (Life Technologies,\nInvitrogen, Paisley, UK) using a polytron homogenizer. Total\nRNA was extracted using Trizol reagent. Reverse transcription\nPCR (RT-PCR) was performed as described elsewhere [23].\nQuantitative real time RT-PCR (Q-PCR) was performed using\nhot start DNA polymerase (Quiagen Ltd, Crawley, UK) in the\npresence of 0.1X SYBR Green (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen,\nPaisley, UK) utilizing the DNA Engine Opticon\u00ae 2 System (MJ\nResearch, Alpha technologies Ltd, Northern Ireland). Reac-\ntions were performed in duplicate and repeated in the rare\ncases when the Ct of the duplicates differed for more than 1\ncycle. A serial dilution of a cDNA from early passage human\narticular chondrocytes was used for a standard curve. Gene\nexpression was calculated using a standard curve and normal-\nized for the expression of the housekeeping gene \u03b2 actin. To\nsimplify the representation of time course analyses, the gene\nexpression data normalized for \u03b2 actin are shown as fold\nincrease from uninjured paired control.\nPrimers and expected amplicon size are: \u03b2-actin\n(GeneBank:BC014861), forward 5'-CACGGCTGCTTC-\nCAGCTC-3', reverse 5'-CACAGGACTCCATGCCCAG-3',\n134 base pairs (bp); MMP-3 (GeneBank:NM_002422), for-\nward 5'-CAACCGTGAGGAAAATCGATGCAG-3', reverse\n5'-CGGCAAGATACAGATTCACGCTCAA-3', 440 bp;\nMMP13 (GeneBank:NM_002427), forward 5'-ACGGAC-\nCCATACAGTTTGAATACAGC-3', reverse 5'-CCATTTGT-\nGGTGTGGGAAGTATCATC-3, 360 bp; BMP-2\n(GeneBank:NM_001200), forward 5'-CGT-\nCAAGCCAAACACAAACAGCG-3', reverse 5'- CAC-\nCCACAACCCTCCACAACCAT-3', 341 bp; FRZB\n(GeneBank:U24163), forward 5'GGGCTATGAAGATGAG-\nGAACGT-3', reverse 5'-ACCGAGTCGATCCTTCCACTT-3',\n79 bp; \u03b2 catenin (GeneBank:X87838), forward 5'-\nCCAGCCGACACCAAGAAGCA-3', reverse 5'-GCG-\nGGACAAAGGGCAAGATT-3', 151 bp; WNT1\n(GeneBank:NM-005430), forward 5'-CTGCCTCTCTTCTTC-\nCCCTT-3', reverse 5'-TCACAGCTGTTCAATGGCTC-3',\n251 bp; WNT5A (GeneBank:L20861), forward 5'-CCACCT-\nTCCTCTTCACACTG-3', reverse 5'-CGAACAAGTAAT-\nGCCCTCTC-3', 770 bp; WNT5B (GeneBank:AB060966),\nforward 5'- CCGCCTCTGCAACAAGACCT-3', reverse 5'-\nAACTTGCAGTGGCAGCGCTC-3', 111 bp; WNT14Page 3 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nArthritis Research & Therapy    Vol 8 No 5    Dell'Accio et al.(GeneBenk:NM_003395), forward 5'- TGAGAAGAACT-\nGCGAGAGCA -3', reverse 5'- CTGTGTGCAATGCCTG-\nTACC -3', 285 bp; WNT16 (GeneBank:NM_016087),\nforward 5'- AAAGAAATGTTTCCCTGCCC -3', reverse 5'-\nGACATTTTCCATGGGTTTGC -3', 106 bp; FRZD-1\n(GeneBank:NM_003505), forward 5'- TTCAGCAGCACAT-\nTCTGAGG-3', reverse 5'- CCTGCACACATTTTCCCTTT-3',\n154 bp; FRZD-7 (GeneBank:NM_003507), forward 5'-\nCTGGAGTTCTTTGAAATGTGCT-3', reverse 5'- AAGGT-\nTAGCTCCCATGATTCTC-3', 133 bp; LEF-1\n(GeneBank:NM_016269), forward 5'- CAGAGAAAGGAG-\nCAGGAGCCAA -3', reverse 5'- TGATGTCAGTGTTCCTTT-\nGGCG -3', 481 bp; TCF-1 (GeneBank:NM000545), forward\n5'- CTCATCACCGACACCACCAACC-3', reverse 5'-\nTCCCACGAAGCAGCGACAGT -3', 608 bp; COL2A1\n(GeneBank:NM_033150), forward 5'- CCCTGAGTGGAA-\nGAGTGGAG -3', reverse 5'- GAGGCGTGAGGTCTTCT-\nGTG -3', 511 bp; Aggrecan (GeneBank:NM-001135),\nforward 5'- GTTGTCATCAGCACCAGCATC -3', reverse 5'-\nACCACACAGTCCTCTCCAGC -3', 509 bp; c-JUN\n(GeneBank:NM_002228), forward 5'-CCCCAAGATCCT-\nGAAACAGA-3', reverse 5'- CCGTTGCTGGACTGGATTAT-\n3'.\nHistology, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry\nTissues were fixed overnight in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde\nat 4\u00b0C, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 \u00b5m\nthick) were used for hematoxylin-eosin and safranin O staining\naccording to standard protocols. The degree of OA was eval-\nuated using a modified Mankin score [24] in which the sub-\nscore related to the tide mark was not included. For immuno-\nhistochemistry, paraffin sections were deparaffinized and\nhydrated in xylene and an ethanol series, post-fixed with 4%\nparaformaldehyde, and washed twice in phosphate-buffered\nsaline. For antigen retrieval in the detection of FRZB and \u03b2 cat-\nenin, the sections were first equilibrated in 0.02% HCl for 7\nminutes, digested in 3 mg\/ml pepsin (Sigma-Aldrich Company\nLtd., Gillingham, UK) in 0.02% HCl for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C,\nwashed in water and allowed to air dry for 20 minutes. Sec-\ntions were washed twice in 0.2% Tween-20 in tris buffered\nsaline (TBST), blocked in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in TBST\nfor 1 hour at room temperature, blotted, and incubated over-\nnight with the primary antibody (goat anti-mouse\/human FRZB\n(R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK), or mouse anti-human \u03b2 catenin\n(BD Transduction Laboratories, BD, Cowley, Oxford, UK) at a\nfinal concentration of 1 \u00b5g\/ml in 0.5% bovine serum albumin\nin TBST. Sections were then washed twice in TBST, and incu-\nbated for 1 hour with the secondary antibody. For FRZB immu-\nnostaining, the secondary antibody was a biotin-conjugated\nrabbit anti-goat antibody (DAKO UK Ltd., Ely Cambridgeshire,\nUK) diluted 1:300. For \u03b2 catenin immunostaining, we used\neither a cy\u21222 conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson\nImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. West Grove, PA, USA)\ndiluted 1:200 for indirect immunofluorescence, or the Strept-\nABComplex\/AP kit (DAKO) for signal amplification and Vec-\ntor\u00ae Red substrate kit (Vector Laboratories UK, Peterborough,\nUK) as a chromogenic substrate of alkaline phosphatase, in\nthe presence of 0.2 mM levamisole to inhibit endogenous alka-\nline phosphatase. For the detection of phosphorylated SMAD-\n1 and SMAD-5, we used the same protocol with the following\nmodifications. For antigen retrieval, instead of pepsin diges-\ntion, we boiled the sections for 10 minutes in sodium citrate\nbuffer, pH 6; we quenched endogenous peroxidase by incu-\nbating for 10 minutes with 9% H2O2; we used the PS-1 antise-\nrum [25] (a kind gift of P ten Dijke and C-H Heldin, Ludwig\nInstitute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden) as primary\nantibody; as secondary antibody we used biotin-conjugated\nsheep anti-rabbit antibody (Serotec UK, Oxford, UK) diluted\n1:200; we used the StreptABComplex\/AP kit (DAKO) as an\namplification system, and Liquid DAB Substrate Chromogen\nSystem (DAKO) as peroxidase substrate. Sections were\nmounted in mowiol (Calbiochem, Merck Biosciences Ltd, Not-\ntingham, UK) containing 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole\n(DAPI; ICN, Stretton Scientific Ltd., Stretton, UK) for nuclear\ncounterstaining. In positive cells the DAB precipitate\nquenched the DAPI fluorescence. Image processing was per-\nformed using Adobe Photoshop version 6 (Adobe). Negative\ncontrols were sections in which isotype and species-matched\nnon-specific immunoglobulins or normal rabbit serum (for\nphospho-SMAD-1\/-5) were used instead of the primary anti-\nbody.\nStatistical analysis\nNormally distributed data sets from paired samples were com-\npared using the paired t test. When the values did not have a\nnormal distribution, they were either transformed into their log-\narithms before analysis or, if this still did not result in a normal\ndistribution, they were analyzed using the Wilcoxon matched\npair test.\nJoint surface injury in mice\nSeven week old C57BL\/6 male mice were utilized for these\nexperiments. The mice were anesthetized and subjected to\nmedial para-patellar arthrotomy. The patellar groove was\nexposed by lateral patellar dislocation. A longitudinal full thick-\nness injury was made in the patellar groove using a custom\nmade device in which the length of a 26G needle was limited\nby a glass bead (injured knee).

Under\nour experimental conditions, uninjured explants preserved\nmetachromatic staining with safranin O (Figure 1b) and toluid-\nine blue (not shown) for at least 6 days. To validate this in vitro\nassay, we tested if we could detect in this injury model upreg-\nulation of metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-13, as has\nbeen reported following mechanical cartilage injury in vitro and\nin vivo [26-28]. Under our experimental conditions, expression\nof MMP-3 and MMP-13 mRNA was significantly upregulated\nin the injured explants of each pair at the day 1 (p < 0.05) and\nday 6 (p < 0.01 for MMP-3; p < 0.05 for MMP-13) time points\n(Figure 1c,d).\nMorphogenetic pathways modulated by mechanical \ninjury\nWe then performed a differential gene expression analysis by\nQ-PCR, comparing the injured versus the paired uninjured\nexplants by focusing on molecular pathways known to play a\nrole in embryonic skeletogenesis and in the repair of other tis-\nsues. We detected statistically highly significant upregulation\nof BMP-2 mRNA (Figure 2a) and down-regulation of the\nsecreted WNT inhibitor FRZB mRNA (Figure 2b) 1 day after\ninjury (p < 0.01).\nMechanical injury is associated with modulation of the \nBMP pathway\nTo determine the temporal window of BMP-2 mRNA regula-\ntion, we performed a time course gene expression analysis at\n5 hours, 1 day, and 6 days after injury. Statistically significant\n(p < 0.05) upregulation of BMP-2 was detected already 5\nhours after wounding and tended to subside within 6 days\n(Figure 3a). Similar results were obtained in the absence of\nserum, where a statistically significant (p < 0.05) upregulation\nof BMP-2 mRNA was present 5 hour after injury (Figure 3b),\nindicating that, under our experimental conditions, the regula-\ntion of BMP-2 expression in response to mechanical injury is\nnot serum dependent.\nTo test whether the adult cartilage tissue is itself a target of\nBMP signaling, we performed immunohistochemistry using an\nantibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the MAD\nhomology domain 2 of SMAD-1 and SMAD-5 [25]. In the\nexplant pair obtained from normal articular cartilage, we\ndetected phospho-SMAD-1\/-5-positive chondrocytes in all\ncartilage layers in the uninjured as well as the injured explants\n(83% in the uninjured explant versus 100% in the injured) (Fig-\nure 3f\u2013h). However, in adjacent uncultured freshly dissected\narticular cartilage, the proportion of phospho-SMAD-1\/-5-pos-\nitive cells was 41%, with nearly all positive cells localized in the\nintermediate layer (Figure 3c\u2013e,h). These results suggest that\nthe dissection of the cartilage explants from the joints may be\nassociated with a molecular response to wounding, which the\nresting period in culture reverted only partially. Consistent with\nthis hypothesis, BMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-13 mRNA levels\nwere lowest in the freshly dissected cartilage, intermediate in\nthe uninjured cultured explant, and highest in the injured\nexplant, while FRZB mRNA levels had an opposite trend. Sim-\nilar results for the proportions of phospho-SMAD-1\/-5-positive\ncells were found in injured and uninjured cartilage explants\nfrom OA cartilage. Finally, SMAD-1\/5 phosphorylation was\nconfirmed in vivo in a mouse model of mechanical joint surface\ninjury (Figure 4). Full characterization of this model represents\nan ongoing effort in our laboratory.\nActivation of the WNT pathway following cartilage \nmechanical injury\nIn a time course analysis, FRZB mRNA was already down-reg-\nulated in some but not all explant pairs 5 hours after injury (Fig-\nure 5a). Similar results were obtained with serum free culture\nconditions (Figure 5b), thereby demonstrating that, under our\nexperimental conditions, FRZB mRNA regulation in response\nto mechanical injury was not dependent on the presence of\nFBS in the culture medium. Statistical analysis confirmed a\nhighly significant difference (p < 0.01) at the day 1 time point\nin the presence of FBS and a significant difference (p < 0.05)\nat the 5 hour and day 1 time points in the absence of serum.\nAt the protein level, FRZB was present in both injured and\nuninjured explants as evaluated by immunohistochemistry (Fig-\nure 5c\u2013f). The proportion of FRZB positive cells was signifi-\ncantly lower (p < 0.05) in the injured explant in three\nindependent explant pairs, confirming at the protein level the\ndown-regulation of FRZB expression in the injured explants\n(Figure 5g). Downregulation of FRZB was confirmed at protein\nFigure 2\nDifferential expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and FRZB mRNA following mechanical injury\nFRZB mRNA following mechanical injury.

Thus, we next investigated\nwhether the expression of components of the WNT pathway\nthat are present in cartilage during mouse embryonic develop-\nment [29,30] is maintained in adult human articular cartilage.\nWe detected mRNA encoding WNT ligands (WNT-1, WNT-\n5a, WNT-5b, WNT-9a\/14, and WNT16), receptors (FRZD-1\nand FRZD-7), intracellular mediators such as \u03b2-catenin, and\ndownstream transcription factors such as TCF and LEF-1\n(data not shown). The presence of \u03b2-catenin was also con-\nfirmed at the protein level (Figure 5h\u2013m).\nWe then investigated whether mechanical injury resulted in a\nnet activation of the canonical WNT pathway by performing\ngene expression analysis of the WNT target genes Axin-2 [31]\nand c-JUN [32,33]. Consistent with our hypothesis and with\nthe activation of the WNT\/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, Axin-2\nmRNA was upregulated 1 day after mechanical injury (Figure\n6a), with a statistically highly significant difference (p < 0.01).\nFigure 4\nA figure showing modulation of the BMP and WNT pathway after mechanical injury in vivo in mice.

The expression of Axin-2 and c-JUN\nwas consistently and significantly (p < 0.05) upregulated in\nthe LiCl-treated explants compared with the paired control\nexplants treated with NaCl (Figure 6c,d). To test the effects of\nthe activation of the canonical WNT pathway in adult human\narticular cartilage, we determined the expression of the carti-\nlage markers COL2A1 and Aggrecan in LiCl treated and con-\ntrol cultures. Under our experimental conditions, LiCl\ntreatment significantly (p < 0.05) upregulated COL2A1 and\nAggrecan mRNA, suggesting an anabolic effect (Figure 6e,f).\nDiscussion\nThe articular cartilage of adult individuals is commonly\nregarded as a passive target of different pathogenic elements,\nsuch as mechanical wear and inflammation, leading to carti-\nlage matrix breakdown and loss of chondrocytes. However,\nacute, small, full thickness JSDs appear to have repair capacity\nin animals and humans, especially in young individuals [2,3,5-\n8]. Repair of full thickness JSDs involves coordination of pat-\nterning and tissue maturation that recapitulates some aspects\nof embryonic skeletal development [6], thereby requiring mor-\nphogenetic signaling. Here we have tested the hypothesis that\nthe injured articular cartilage may be a source of morphoge-\nnetic signals activated by damage. To this end we have used\nan ex vivo model to investigate the modulation of gene expres-\nsion induced by mechanical injury to adult human articular car-\ntilage explants. We have detected upregulation of BMP-2\nmRNA after injury. Several factors can determine activation of\nBMP signaling independently of the expression of one ligand,\nincluding secretion and solubility of the ligand(s), its\/their bind-\ning to matrix molecules, the presence of secreted or intracellu-\nlar inhibitors and receptor regulation [35]. Our data showing\nphosphorylation of SMAD-1\/-5 suggest activation of BMP sig-\nnaling.\nBMPs elicit a well-documented anabolic response on cartilage\nexplants [20], and genetic evidence has been provided that\nthe BMP pathway is needed for joint homeostasis in adulthood\n[36]. Indeed, targeted deletion of the gene encoding BMP\nreceptor 1A in the articular cartilage in mice results in joint sur-\nface degeneration resembling OA [36]. In addition, BMPs\nhave been shown to regulate recruitment of chondroprogeni-\ntors [37], synthesis of cartilage matrix, and endochondral bone\nformation [20] during embryonic skeletogenesis. Finally, the\nexpression of BMP-2 mRNA is associated with the capacity of\nin vitro expanded adult human articular chondrocytes to form\nstable cartilage in vivo, resistant to vascular invasion and\nendochondral bone formation [23]. Therefore, the recruitment\nof progenitor cells, the regulation of endochondral bone forma-\ntion and cartilage extracellular matrix synthesis, as well as the\npreservation of the phenotypic stability of articular chondro-\ncytes are all potential roles of BMP signaling in JSD repair.\nHowever, it must be underscored that BMP signaling also\nplays a part in the pathogenesis of joint diseases such as oste-\nFigure 6\nActivation of the WNT\/\u03b2 catenin canonical pathway following mechani-cal njury\ncal injury. (a) Axin-2 and (b) c-JUN mRNAs, two known transcriptional \ntargets of the WNT\/\u03b2 catenin canonical pathway, were upregulated 1 \nday after injury compared to uninjured controls.

LiCl treatment also upregulated aggre-\ncan and COL2A1 mRNA (e,f). **p < 0.01.

Finally,\nupregulation of BMP-2 has already been reported following\nexposure of cartilage explants to interleukin 1 and tumor\nnecrosis factor alpha [40]. It is possible, therefore, that upreg-\nulation of BMP-2 may represent a response of the articular car-\ntilage to different types of injuries.\nIn addition to the upregulation of BMP-2 mRNA, we have doc-\numented a consistent injury-associated down-regulation of the\nsecreted WNT inhibitor FRZB, suggesting de-repression of\nthe WNT signaling pathway. Consistently, we have detected,\nin the injured explants, upregulation of mRNA encoding the\nWNT\/\u03b2 catenin transcriptional targets Axin-2 and c-JUN. The\nWNT signaling pathway can be regulated at multiple levels\n[22] and, therefore, our experimental setup does not allow\ndetermining whether the decreased expression of FRZB\nmRNA is responsible for the detected upregulation of the\nWNT\/\u03b2 catenin target genes. Nevertheless, the functional\nimportance of the regulation of FRZB expression in the context\nof joint homeostasis is underscored by the observation that a\nsingle nucleotide polymorphism causing loss of function of the\nFRZB gene product is associated with hip OA in humans [41].\nThe function of WNT signaling in the context of joint surface\ndefect repair is still poorly understood. Studies on embryonic\ntissues indicate that the activation of the canonical \u03b2 catenin\npathway plays an important role in joint specification [30,42]\nand in the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation inhibiting\nchondrogenesis in immature mesenchymal cells and enhanc-\ning terminal differentiation in mature chondrocytes [29,32].\nHowever, while the data in embryonic tissues suggest a gen-\neral inhibitory effect of canonical WNT signaling on chondro-\ngenesis, in experimental models utilizing adult cells, the\nactivation of the \u03b2 catenin-dependent canonical WNT path-\nway, under specific experimental conditions, rather appears to\npromote chondrogenesis and cartilage differentiation [43-45].\nThis is in line with our findings that adult human articular carti-\nlage explants cultured in the presence of LiCl upregulate\nCOL2A1 and aggrecan mRNA. Since in other organ systems\nWNTs are involved in supporting repair processes by main-\ntaining a stem cell pool and specifying cell fates [19,46,47], it\nis tempting to speculate that the canonical WNT pathway\nwould play a similar function in the repair of osteochondral\ndefects. Finally, there is also evidence that WNTs, at least\nthrough the non-canonical pathway, may be implicated in joint\ninflammation and may be detrimental for cartilage integrity\n[48]. The most likely interpretation of these apparently con-\ntrasting data is that a tight regulation of the WNT and the BMP\npathways is necessary for proper joint homeostasis and repair\nand that, in postnatal life, the same mechanisms that are set\ninto action to support repair may also play a pathogenic role\nwhen de-regulated or when restoration of homeostasis fails. In\nthis regard, it is interesting that gain or loss of function of \u03b2 cat-\nenin in the developing skeleton both result in severe chondro-\ndysplasia, although through different mechanisms [49].\nWe have encountered a high variability in the molecular\nresponses to injury in different pairs of cartilage explants. This\nvariability can be explained by the heterogeneity of tissues\nfrom patient to patient, and by our inability to obtain adequately\n'homogeneous' preparation of the explants. Analogous varia-\nbility has been reported in the molecular response of cartilage\nexplants to inflammatory cytokines [50]. Indeed, the variability\nin the molecular response to injury could be a factor contribut-\ning to the variability in the clinical outcome of untreated acute\narticular cartilage injuries.\nIn some experiments, the differences in gene expression were\nof small magnitude. However, we have observed a reproduci-\nble upregulation of WNT reporter genes, including Axin-2, fol-\nlowing injury or LiCl treatment, which indicate that the\nmodulation of the wnt signaling was sufficient to induce a tran-\nscriptional response. Axin-2 upregulation of approximately the\nsame magnitude was reported to be associated with\nincreased bone mass in osteoporotic lrp5-\/- mice following oral\nadministration of LiCl [51]. Remarkably, the plasma levels of\nLiCl achieved in that study were only 0.4 to 0.5 mM, which are\ninsufficient to trigger detectable wnt responses in the classic\nassays such as \u03b2 catenin nuclear localization or activation of\nthe TOP-FLASH reporter. It is reasonable that this magnitude\nof wnt activation in adult animals is probably more physiologi-\ncal than that achieved in overexpression experiments [51].\nIndeed, in postnatal life, morphogenetic events take place at a\nmuch lower rate than in embryonic development and, there-\nfore, slight changes in the balance of the morphogenetic path-\nways can result in significant biological effects.\nThe in vitro culture conditions may influence the molecular\nresponse to injury, potentially introducing artifacts. However,\nthe reproducibility of FRZB and BMP-2 mRNA regulation in\nresponse to damage regardless of the presence of serum in\nthe culture medium suggests that this response is largely not\ndependent on culture conditions. In addition, it is possible that\nthe response to injury in vivo will be more vibrant than that in\nvitro because the resting period does not appear to be suffi-\ncient to completely reverse the response due to the initial dis-\nsection of the explants. In this respect, Vincent and colleagues\n[52] reported rapid phosphorylation of ERK following dissec-\ntion of porcine articular cartilage explants, which was com-\npletely reverted after 48 hours of \"resting\" in culture. In our\nstudy, the modulation of BMP-2 and FRZB mRNA appear to\nlast longer than 48 hours. This is also supported by the analy-\nsis of the sample in Figure 3h, in which the expression levels\nof all molecules tested and the number of phospho-SMAD-1\/-\n5-positive cells in the rested explant were intermediate\nbetween the freshly dissected explant and the explant re-\ninjured after the resting period. Most importantly, we have\nshown phosphorylation of SMAD-1\/-5 and downregulation of\nFRZB expression in vivo in a mouse model of joint surface\ninjury (Figure 4) not only confirming our data in vivo, but also\nsuggesting that such mechanisms are evolutionarily con-Page 10 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nAvailable online http:\/\/arthritis-research.com\/content\/8\/5\/R139served. Functional studies are being performed to evaluate the\nrole of these molecular mechanisms in the context of cartilage\ndamage and repair. Full characterization of this model is an\nongoing effort in our laboratory.\nInjuries to the articular cartilage result in activation of the bone\nmarrow and subchondral bone remodeling [53], suggesting\nthe presence of molecular signals that are released and target\nthe neighboring tissues. We have demonstrated that mechan-\nical injury in vitro can elicit the activation of two of the most\nimportant signaling pathways involved in embryonic skele-\ntogenesis and joint morphogenesis, suggesting that the artic-\nular cartilage is capable of triggering a signaling machinery\nthat may play a role in joint surface repair.\nAlthough several risk factors for OA have been identified,\nincluding the nature and entity of the injury, age, genetic pre-\ndisposition, and joint congruity, it is still not clear why some\nindividuals can efficiently repair JSDs while some others will\ndevelop chronic symptomatic lesions requiring surgical inter-\nvention and possibly evolving into OA [1]. Failure of repair sig-\nnaling may contribute to evolution towards OA. Our data\nsuggest that morphogenetic pathways are transiently acti-\nvated early following acute injury, as has been reported in\nother organ systems [19]. Insufficient or untimely activation of\nthis machinery may result in repair failure. It is important, there-\nfore, to study these events in a temporally dynamic fashion,\nand it is possible that the early post-traumatic signals may be\ncritical for the final repair outcome. Understanding the molec-\nular mechanisms of repair may help us define a more focused\nindication for biological JSD repair. On the other hand, the\nmodulation of these signaling pathways (e.g., by controlled\nrelease of bioactive molecules from scaffolding biomaterials)\nmay complement the available tissue engineering approaches\nto enhance specific aspects of repair. Finally, the persistence\nin adulthood of locally residing stem cells within several joint\ntissues, including bone marrow [54], synovial membrane [16],\nperiosteum [13], and articular cartilage [12,14,15,18], opens\nthe possibility to recruit and guide these cells locally using\nappropriate molecular signals to enhance repair. This would\ncircumvent a number of problems associated with ex vivo cell\nmanipulation, including phenotypic instability, high costs, non-\noptimal consistency, and complex regulation of the cellular\nproducts [55].\nConclusion\nOur data show modulation of the WNT and BMP signaling\npathways in adult human and mouse articular cartilage follow-\ning mechanical injury in vitro and in vivo. These molecular\nevents may contribute to trigger or support a repair response\nand failure to promptly activate these reparative signals may\ncontribute to poor repair and poor clinical outcome. Hence,\nactivation of the WNT and BMP pathways in response to injury\nmay represent a prognostic marker and at the same time a\ntherapeutic target to enhance the early response of the joint\nsurface to acute injury.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nFD designed the study, performed the experiments and\ndrafted the manuscript.
