Yet these approaches to\nchange management are coming under in-\ncreasing scrutiny and there is mounting\nevidence that one of the greatest obstacles to\neffecting real change is the idea that it comes\nabout through company-wide change pro-\ngrammes (Beer et al., 1996). `` Despite all the\nrhetoric surrounding transformation and\nmajor change programmes, the reality is that\ntoday's managers have not yet encountered\nchange programs that work'' (Argyris, 1998,\np. 104).\nIn the management of change, managers\ncan find themselves faced with innumerable\ncontradictions and double-binds (Dopson and\nNeumann, 1994) as they attempt to cope with\nincreased accountability and empowerment,\nthe need for creativity and efficiency, the\nneed to act locally and think globally and so\non. In an effort to resolve these difficulties,\ncompany sponsored management training\nand development has increasingly been seen\nas a central platform of `` programmatic\nchange'' (Beer et al., 1990). For example,\nmanagement development is seen as critical\nto the cascading of culture change pro-\ngrammes that seek to embed new organiza-\ntional attitudes and values (Willmott, 1993).\nBut far from ensuring alignment between\nemployee and employer aspirations, many\nmanagers have often `` mimicked'' the re-\nquired behaviours (Denham et al., 1996; Hope\nand Hendry, 1995) in an attempt to `` ring\nfence'' the degree of self which they are\nprepared to put into their work.\nManagement development has often been\npresented as a desirable, and sometimes even\nvalue-free activity for the individual and\norganization (Hopfl and Dawes, 1995); but\nsuch activities are also increasingly seen as\nopportunities for normative control (Coopey,\n1995). Management development, sanctioned\nby senior management, will in its execution\nconstruct impressions of behaviours and\nattributes that are needed if those managers\nare to be perceived as successful by that\nsenior management (Hopfl and Dawes, 1995).\nManagement development professionals\nthemselves, are similarly under increasing\nscrutiny. Recent research from Atkinson and\nMeldrum (1998) into the quality of manage-\nment development professionals, as per-\nceived by line management, revealed an\nunflattering description. Line management\nwere largely ambivalent or negative about\nthis group's ability to take a strategic view or\nto act as good role models. This image of\nmanagement development professionals,\ncombined with the perception of manage-\nment development as an agent of control, has\nhelped to contribute to a description of\nmanagement development `` as a game of\nmeaningless outcomes'' (Clarke, 1999).\nNor is the impact of management develop-\nment confined to issues of organization\nefficiency. The role of organizations in our\nsociety is pre-eminent.

This paper will\nexamine an emerging approach to change\nmanagement in which the role of the indivi-\ndual is central to the starting point for such\nchange. This approach potentially provides a\nplatform for management development to\nenhance greater individual autonomy, facil-\nitate better organizational adaptation to\nchanging environments, and encourage a\nmore healthy society through questioning\nthe institutionalised status quo. The identi-\nfication of these outcomes for management\ndevelopment is not new. What is different,\nhowever, is that this paper will describe how\nthese goals may be best achieved by man-\nagement development becoming an agent of\nsubversion and critical questioning rather\nthan `` trust, truth, love and collaboration''\n(Buchanan and Boddy, 1993). The paper will\nfirst set the context for this by examining\nsome of the drawbacks to traditional change\nmanagement and its wider impact in exacer-\nbating organizational cynicism. New ap-\nproaches to change will be explored as a\nbackdrop for considering the value of critical\nreflection which a cynical perspective can\nstimulate. The paper will conclude by con-\nsidering how this critical and potentially\nsubversive approach could form the basis for\na future role for management development in\nstimulating not just organizational but ulti-\nmately, wider social change. The intention\nhere is not to provide a detailed manifesto for\nchange, but to widen the debate about the\npotential role of management development as\na key feature on the education agenda of the\nnext century.\nOD at the organization level\nThe rate of change currently experienced by\norganizations is forcing a substantial shift in\norganizational form and must, therefore,\nforce a change in the way we manage these\norganizations. In traditional hierarchical\nforms senior managers set direction through\nstrategy and the control of resources etc.\n(Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1997). But such ap-\nproaches are so full of inner contradictions\nthat they kill the innovation and motivation\nthose organizations require to remain com-\npetitive (Argyris, 1998). Hierarchical organi-\nzations breed hierarchical behaviours\n(Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1997). It has almost\nbecome almost an established organizational\nprinciple that such hierarchies are unlikely\nto be able to respond quickly or effectively\nenough to rapid change. A hierarchical\norganizational form is seen to be so riddled\nwith conflicting layers of self-interest and\ndiffering agendas that issues are blurred and\ndecision making is slowed down and dissi-\npated in the favour of those different com-\npeting interest groups. Accordingly, a\ntemplate for more emergent and organic,\neven apparently chaotic structures, is com-\ning to be seen as more appropriate in the\nfuture if organizations are to be able to\nrespond to the demand for almost continuous\ninnovation ((Tetenbaum, 1998; Miles et al.,\n1997). Therefore, there will be an increasing\nneed for senior managers to move their focus\nfrom one of control to one where their role is\nto foster entrepreneurial initiative and sup-\nport radically decentralized operations (Bar-\ntlett and Ghoshal, 1997) where people are\ncapable of acting creatively and autono-\nmously toward their specific markets oppor-\ntunities.\nBut how far away is this future template\nfor senior management from current prac-\ntice? If hierarchical organizations breed\nhierarchical behaviours, then a culture of\ncommand and control which enabled those\nsenior managers to reach their senior posi-\ntions in the first place is likely to prevail and\nthis can place a number of blockers on\norganizational and individual effectiveness.\nFor example, contemporary managerial cul-\nture in Western capitalist society has been\ndescribed as a combination of `` social Dar-\nwinism'' and `` functional rationality'' which\ncan produce a competitive paradigm in\nwhich employees come to be manipulated,\ncodified and catalogued, rather than freed to\nassume greater autonomy (Bowles, 1997).\nFurthermore, within this paradigm, the need\nfor managers to be seen as successful and\nworthy of promotion, sometimes places them\nunder pressure to bend to existing norms\nrather than innovate (Coopey, 1995, p. 66). It\nis also doubtful that these institutionalized\npower relations within organizations can\neasily be changed through traditional pro-\ncesses of corporate transformation. The point\nis clearly demonstrated in a recent survey by\nWorrall and Cooper (1997). Their findings\ngathered from members of the Institute of\nManagement called into question `` whether\nthe objectives of change management pro-\ngrammes . . . have actually been convincingly\nachieved'' (1997, p. 30). But, more impor-\ntantly, the survey revealed that junior man-\nagers were likely to view senior management\nstyle as being authoritative, bureaucratic,\ncautious, reactive, secretive, traditional and\nvacillating.\nIn many ways, a programme of change set\nat the organizational level, is predicated on\nthe degree of certainty and control it appears\nto provide but is often unlikely to create\nautonomy and innovation precisely because\nof that degree of control and certainty.\n[ 768 ]\nMartin Clarke\nManagement development: a\nnew role in social change?\nManagement Decision\n37\/10 [1999] 767\u00b1777\n`` When employees actions are defined almost\nexclusively from the outside, the resulting\nbehaviour cannot be empowering and liber-\nating'' (Argyris, 1998, p. 101). Far from\nempowering individuals, OD managed at the\norganizational level implicitly reinforces in-\nstitutional control and often, through a\nprocess of `` cultural doping'' (Alvesson and\nWillmott, 1996), encourages dependency on\nexisting organizational values rather than\nchallenge them. Ironically therefore many\nchange initiatives undermine the employee\nautonomy they purport to create. This cre-\nates considerable cynicism and demotivation\nas employees experience these inherent con-\ntradictions and paradoxes of organizational\nlife. Such is the extent of this cynicism that it\nhas attracted considerable academic concern\nin recent years (Andersson, 1996; Reichers et\nal., 1997; Dean et al., 1998). The pervasive\nnature of cynicism will now be briefly\nexplored as an alternative starting point for\nmanagement development.\nOrganizational cynicism\nMost of the work in this area defines cyni-\ncism in negative terms, as an `` attitude of\ncontempt, frustration, and distrust toward an\nobject or multiple objects, susceptible to\nchange by exposure to factors in the envir-\nonment'' (Andersson, 1996, p. 1397). Therefore,\nas an attitude, cynicism comprises a combi-\nnation of: beliefs that organizations betray a\nlack of fairness, honesty, and sincerity; affect,\nan emotional response toward their organi-\nzation; and behaviour which may comprise\ncritical observation, presenting pessimistic\nviews etc. (Dean et al., 1998).\nMany of the antecedents of cynicism can be\nfound in the shortcomings of top-down\nchange management. Andersson (1996) has\nidentified the roots of such cynicism in the\nincreasing number of organizational `` con-\ntract violations''. These may include psycho-\nlogical, implied or formal contractual\nviolations between individuals and their\nemployer. Based on this analysis, Andersson\nidentifies three potential predictors of work-\nplace cynicism:\n1 Environmental \u00b1 higher executive pay,\nharsh layoffs, unjustified corporate prof-\nits, corporate irresponsibility.\n2 Organizational \u00b1 infrequent or inadequate\ncommunication, limited voice expression,\ndiscourteous interpersonal treatment,\nmanagement incompetence, use of man-\nagement techniques.\n3 Job\/role characteristics \u00b1 role ambiguity,\nrole conflict, work overload.\nThe changing nature of organizational forms\ntoward more fluid and ambiguous structures\nwould suggest that a great many character-\nistics of jobs and roles are likely to continue\nto become ambiguous and generate conflict\nin the future (Worrall and Cooper, 1997;\nHolbeche and Glynn, 1998). Similarly, if the\nprevailing approach to change management\nis continuing to fail, if managers have yet to\nexperience change programmes that really\nwork, we must also consider the extent to\nwhich Andersson's (1996) second category is\nalso likely to continue for the foreseeable\nfuture. Lack of adequate information about\nchange and experience of unsuccessful\nchange programmes were also identified as\ndeterminants of cynicism by Reichers et al.\n(1997). Dean et al. (1998) are careful about\ndetermining whether organizational cyni-\ncism is justifiable in any given situation.\nThis, being a matter of opinion, is no basis\nfor theory (1998, p. 347). However, given the\nview that the determinants of organizational\ncynicism are likely to increase, perhaps a\nmore relevant observation is whether cyni-\ncism is an inevitable condition of contem-\nporary organizational life. Is it an aberration\nto be controlled, or a precondition for sur-\nviving in organizational life?\nWhile for some this analysis to date may\npresent a bleak picture of organizations, it\ncan also actually provide a real point of\ndeparture for reframing approaches to orga-\nnization development and the role of man-\nagement development in facilitating this\nchange. Rather than pursuing a na\u00f5\u00c8vely\noptimistic approach to management devel-\nopment let us accept the manager's own\nstarting point. The rationale for this is clear\nwhen you consider that `` if motivation, con-\ntrol and leadership are problem areas in an\norganisation then the political reality un-\nderlying these issues must necessarily be one\nof struggle, conflict and lack of consensus''\n(Bacharach and Lawler, 1980). So rather than\ntrying to stimulate change through open,\ncollaborative relationships which only pro-\nduce limited success (Buchanan and Boddy,\n1993), it may be more practical to start with a\nmanager's own cynically informed view of\norganizations. In order to appreciate the real\nvalue of this starting point, the next section\nwill deal with some of the emerging trends in\nOD. These trends will be then related to how\ncynicism may form a useful starting place for\nmanagement development to foster greater\nmanagerial autonomy and social responsi-\nbility.\nOD at the individual level\nIn response to this need for ever-increasing\nchange and innovation and the growing\n[ 769 ]\nMartin Clarke\nManagement development: a\nnew role in social change?\nManagement Decision\n37\/10 [1999] 767\u00b1777\ndisillusionment with traditional approaches\nto organization change, alternative ap-\nproaches have been emerging with indivi-\nduals and groups as the starting point for\norganization development interventions\n(Beer, 1990; Butcher et al., 1997; Clarke and\nMeldrum, 1999; Frohman, 1997; Hendry, 1996).\nIn this approach, change is seen as a `` jointly,\nanalytical, educational\/learning, and politi-\ncal process'' (Pettigrew and Whipp, 1991), in\nwhich organization contexts are open to\nredefinition by powerful individual actors.\nThese actors create pockets of good practice,\ngroups of people and activities who `` share\ntacit knowledge and through dialogue bring\nthis to the surface; they exchange ideas about\nwork practice and experiment with new\nmethods and ideas; they engage in discus-\nsions which affirm or modify theories in use;\nthey innovate new problem-solving routines\nand simultaneously manage and repair the\nsocial context'' (Hendry, 1996, p. 628).\nThrough linked pockets of good practice\n`` knowledge, rules for action, and culture are\nspread'' (Hendry, 1996, p. 628).\nIn this way organization change is an\nemergent, organic process created by indivi-\ndual action, somewhat akin to Morgan's\n(1993) `` strategic termites''. The role of senior\nmanagement then becomes one of detecting\nand supporting these emergent pockets of\ngood practice (Beer et al., 1990). But as we\nhave seen, this is unlikely within existing\norganizational power relations. Therefore, a\nnecessary pre-condition for the successful\ncreation of pockets of good practice, lies in\nthe need for such strategic termites to be\ncritical, to challenge and even subvert the\nstatus quo. In this context being critical\nfocuses on `` asking questions of purpose\nand of confronting the taken-for-granted,\nconcealed interests and ideologies which\ninform managerial thought and action''\n(Reynolds, 1998, p. 184). The capacity to\nengage in critical reflection requires consid-\nerable self-awareness, cognitive capabilities,\nemotional resilience, political skill etc.\nThe need for these high order capabilities\nposes two important issues for the develop-\nment of managers. First, why should man-\nagers wish to engage in such subversive\nactivity in the first place and why would they\nthen see this approach as more likely to be\neffective? Second, how can individuals be\nsubversive and credible? How can managers\nlearn to read organization context, power\nrelations and political activity? Some of the\nanswers to these questions can be found in\nthe way we develop managers. The assertion\nhere is that one way of developing a critical\nperspective may be most usefully found and\nnurtured within the domain of organizational\ncynicism, which on first sight, is contrary to\nmuch of the received wisdom in management\ndevelopment. Another part of the answer\nrests with the inescapable truism that new\ntheories may be convincing because they\nwork (Berger and Luckman, 1996, p. 137).\nChange initiated by pockets of good practice\nare essentially both real, and realistic for\npractising managers because it accords with\ntheir everyday experience of managerial life.\nBoth of these potential answers will now be\nexplored in more detail followed by an\nassessment of the impact of these ideas on the\nfuture role of management development.\nThe positive value of cynicism\nAs we have seen there is plenty of evidence to\nsupport the view that organizational life is\nincreasingly experienced in a cynical way by\nactors (Dopson and Nuemann, 1994; Denham\net al., 1996; Hope and Hendry, 1995; Reichers\net al., 1997). But this cynical perspective does\nhave other possibilities too. Cynicism can\nhelp make sense of puzzling events in the\nenvironment (Reichers et al., 1997). It can\nprevent being taken advantage of and put a\ncheck on expediency over principle, should\nthose seeking expediency believe that self-\ninterest might go undetected (Dean et al.,\n1998). But, above all, cynicism can help\nmanagers see the institutionalized power\nrelationships at work in organizations. It\nrecognises that choices of organizational\ndirection are influenced by self-interest\n(Dean et al., 1998) and that there are often\nhidden motives for actions..\nAt one level, therefore, cynicism can pro-\nvide value because it explicitly surfaces the\ninfluence of management self-interest and of\nthe repeated failure of management to intro-\nduce effective top-down organizational\nchange. In other words it encourages a\ncritical perspective which challenges the\nassumptions that foster the inevitability of\nsuch authoritarianism in organizations\n(Reynolds, 1998). Cynicism provides a good\nstarting point for developing managers be-\ncause it is so much part of their everyday\nreality and lived experience of organizations.\nHowever, the idea of using cynicism as a\nstarting point for management development\nclearly faces many difficulties as it is so\nembedded as a negative attitude. What makes\ncynicism so dysfunctional is the affective\ndimension recognised by Dean et al. (1998)\nand its tendency to promote entirely self-\nserving behaviour. The affective domain is\nrevealed in the emotion, anger, shame, dis-\ntress etc., caused by contract violations,\nwhen expectations are not met and\n[ 770 ]\nMartin Clarke\nManagement development: a\nnew role in social change?\nManagement Decision\n37\/10 [1999] 767\u00b1777\ndisillusionment prevails (Andersson, 1996).\nIn an effort to protect the self from further\nharm the individual will pursue an entirely\nself-serving agenda. It therefore follows that\nif managers are able to rise above the\nemotional consequences of contract viola-\ntions they will need to acquire greater\nemotional resilience. This resilience will\nenable them to see events without persona-\nlising them (Butcher et al., 1997), and main-\ntain a balanced view of events and motives\nwithout the temptation to blame or be judg-\nmental. This balanced view should provide a\nstarting point from which managers could\nengage in a more critical analysis, to develop\nperceptual acuity in interpersonal relation-\nships and to see failures in communication\netc., as an inevitable outcome of competing\ninterest groups rather than attributing it to\nan unfair system. If the system is not seen as\nunfair, it provides an opportunity for man-\nagers to consider ways in which self-interest\nmight become congruent with organizational\ninterest. Accepting managerial cynicism as a\nbasis for developing a critical perspective and\nas inevitable rather than an aberration,\nprovides some challenges for management\ndevelopment but also potentially re-frames\nits role in organizations and society. These\nideas will be discussed shortly. But why\nshould starting with a cynical approach be\nany more valuable than traditional ap-\nproaches to stimulating change? This brings\nus to the second part of our answer and may\nbe most usefully explored by examining the\nways individual actors perceive their change\ncontext.\nThe managers' experience of\norganizational life\nWe have examined traditional approaches to\norganizational change as being contradic-\ntory, paradoxical and often seen as de-huma-\nnizing by organizational actors because the\nunderlying paradigm reflects rational, top-\ndown control. Expecting planned outcomes\nfrom organization-wide change in a context\nopen to multiple interpretations by those\ninvolved, seems remote. Using a critical\nperspective of organizations immediately\nsurfaces issues of managerial power and\ncontrol. Accepting the socially constructed\nrealities of power, the manager then has\nchoices whether to accept, bend or subvert\nthe rules that are perceived as concomitant\nwith that power. Whether the manager sees\nthese choices as real will be dependent on a\nfunction of the individual's beliefs concern-\ning the personal consequences of reinter-\npreting those rules. It will also be dependent\non the individual's perceptions of the need to\ncomply with referent group expectations\nabout the enactment of those rules (Fishbein\nand Ajzen, 1975). So decision-by-decision,\nmeeting-by-meeting, managers are engaged\nin a process of negotiating the rules of the\ngame. Not only will actors accept or bend the\nrules but can also subvert them in ways\nwhich can have a powerful impact on the\nformal and informal rules of organizational\nlife. Research by Johnson et al. (1997) into\ninstitutional change demonstrates that initi-\nating subversive behaviour from within\nestablished organizational power relations is\ncommon and achievable.\nChange initiated from below, therefore, has\nmuch more resonance with managers' real\nexperiences of organizational life; of daily\nconflicts, resistance, competitive positioning\nof causes, local needs versus organizational\nmandates etc. It is this type of experience\nwhich feeds managerial cynicism. Therefore,\nchange which starts with individuals' own\ncritical perceptions of self-interest, ambition,\nreward and interpretations of organizational\npower bases etc., is much more likely to be\nenacted because it is real and immediate for\nthose involved. Managers working in this\nway can see that they can make a difference\nto their own circumstances and to the\norganization (however small). The key ques-\ntion is the extent to which those actors are\nable or willing to engage in behaviour which\nmay be construed as subversive and how can\nthis be closely aligned with organizational\nneeds. This brings us to the role of manage-\nment development in stimulating such\nchange.\nA future role for management\ndevelopment?\nIf organizations need new approaches to\nchange and these approaches will need to be\ninherently critical of the status quo, man-\nagement development might have a new role\nin developing managers to be subversive by\nbuilding pockets of good practice. In this\nway, individual and organizational agendas\ncan become congruent. If pockets of good\npractice are to flourish as a viable approach\nto organizational change then they will\nimplicitly challenge the assumptions behind\nexisting power relations because they ques-\ntion the primacy of corporate, top down\ncontrol. In this respect they run the risk of\nbeing interpreted as evidence of organiza-\ntional misbehaviour in that they will run\ncounter to shared organizational norms and\nexpectations (Vardi and Weiner, 1996). The\nability of managers to undertake this type of\n[ 771 ]\nMartin Clarke\nManagement development: a\nnew role in social change?\nManagement Decision\n37\/10 [1999] 767\u00b1777\nsubversion requires considerable interper-\nsonal, political and cognitive skills. Clarke\nand Meldrum (1999) have identified five key\npersonal attributes needed for the develop-\nment of such pockets in ways which reduce\nthis possibility:\n1 political astuteness, the ability to read\norganizational contexts;\n2 ability to `` position'' intentions, the way\nindividuals and departments represent\nthemselves in order to gain credibility and\nact as a role model for change;\n3 envisioning, creating a vision that is\ndifferentiated, yet meets key organiza-\ntional success criteria;\n4 subversive, being able to stand outside\norganizational rhetoric, questioning or-\nganizational norms whilst still meeting\norganizational success criteria; and\n5 taking personal risk, understanding the\npersonal and developmental implications\nfor oneself in taking these actions.\nEach of these attributes reflects a critical\nperspective. For example, in order to `` posi-\ntion'' a pocket to deliver its differentiated\nvision, a manager must be able to read the\nformal and informal organizational success\ncriteria, in order to be credible to the\ndominant majority. In other words, man-\nagers must be able to read the unwritten\nrules of the game (Scott-Morgan, 1994) about\n`` what it takes to get on around here''. If a\nminority is to be seen as credible it may need\nto be flexible in its positioning depending\nwhether it is on the inside or outside of the\nmajority which provides the dominant defi-\nnition of reality (Mugny, 1984). Political\nastuteness is, therefore, necessary in order to\nbe able to determine the existing power\nrelations within different organizational\ngroups which may interpret the action of\nsuch pockets in different ways. A critical\nperspective is, therefore, a prerequisite for\nthe execution of these attributes. All of this\nhas considerable implications for the devel-\nopment of managers. While the need for such\na critical perspective has been widely dis-\ncussed in academic journals, so far little\nattention has been given to formulating an\neducational methodology which can foster\nsuch a critical perspective among practising\nmanagers (Reynolds, 1998). So, how might\nthis critical perspective and its contingent\ncynical viewpoint be developed in managers\nto enable the deployment of these attributes?\nIn discussing cynicism, Andersson (1996)\nidentifies a number of `` dispositional mod-\nerators'' which can predispose individuals to\nact negatively in situations which are seen to\nbe unjust. These moderators are: self-esteem,\nlocus of control, equity sensitivity, negative\naffectivity, work ethic, machiavellianism and\ndemographic characteristics. With the ex-\nception of the last item, the list provides a\ngood indicator of those factors which directly\ninfluence the dysfunctional affective domain\nof cynicism discussed earlier. The develop-\nment of managers so that they are able to\nincrease or decrease the impact of these\ntraits can enhance the emotional resilience\nneeded to help move from cynicism to criti-\ncism. Many existing personal development\nactivities attempt to influence the attitudes\nand behaviours which underpin these per-\nsonality traits, but many are developed\nirrespective of the organizational context of\nthe manager (Atkinson, forthcoming). In\naddition, much existing organizationally-\nmotivated management development is based\non a competency approach which reflects a\nreductionist template for development (Will-\nmott, 1994). A process which helps to develop\na critical perspective must take account of\nthe manager as a whole complex being acting\nin a dynamic environment with other com-\nplex people (Burgoyne, 1998).\nThis can be achieved through the develop-\nment of underlying `` meta-abilities'', those\npersonal, acquired abilities which underpin\nand determine how, and when, knowledge\nand skills will be used (Brown, 1993). These\ninclude capabilities such as self-understand-\ning, cognitive skills, personal drive and\nemotional resilience. These are most effec-\ntively surfaced through a development pro-\ncess which creates a disconnect or disjoint in\npreviously held mindsets forcing a signifi-\ncant personal transition which allows man-\nagers to step aside from previous frames of\nreference and to see the world `` afresh''. In\nturn this facilitates an increase in the\nmanagers' cognitive complexity and thus\ntheir capacity for critical reflection. The\nexact detail of this approach is beyond our\ndiscussion here but the major building\nblocks for these ideas can be found in\nButcher et al. (1997), Conger and Xin (1996),\nand Clarke (1998). Most importantly, this type\nof process can enable managers to glimpse\nmoments of `` micro-emancipation'' (Alvesson\nand Willmott, 1996). Micro emancipation\nconcerns those situations in which man-\nagers, through a process of critical reflection,\nare able to make partial, or even just\ntemporary movements, in developing greater\nautonomy and responsibility for others (Al-\nvesson and Willmott, 1996). In essence these\nmoments of micro emancipation enable\nmanagers to see the political realities of\norganizational life. Enabling such glimpses\nhelps identify the socially constructed nature\nof reality and, therefore, the opportunity for\nits re-definition. This results in managers\n[ 772 ]\nMartin Clarke\nManagement development: a\nnew role in social change?\nManagement Decision\n37\/10 [1999] 767\u00b1777\nbeing able to see choices in what they do and\nthis choice is central to the managers'\nmotivation and ability to engage in subver-\nsive action.\nThis possibility of encouraging moments of\nmicro-emancipation for individuals provides\nfor a new and more impactful role for\nmanagement development. In essence, in\nraising micro issues of control and autonomy\nfor individuals, management development\nwould be fulfilling a broader educative role,\nnot merely providing skills training. Educa-\ntion cannot exist independently of its social\ncontext, and is rightly open to the influence\nof government, community and interest\ngroups. However, despite this influence, one\nof the core values of education remains that\nof enabling people to explore alternative\npoints of view, as free from bias as possible.\nThis core value remains dominant in Wes-\ntern education despite the ongoing conflict\nwith community control that this can create\n(see Worsley, 1970, p. 178 for example). The\nprocess of enabling critical reflection is a key\ningredient in management development ful-\nfilling a wider educative role as it provides a\nbasis for exploring alternative views, chal-\nlenging assumptions and identifying bias and\ncovert interests. By enabling managers to\ncritically explore issues of power and poli-\ntics, managers will inevitably raise funda-\nmental questions about themselves and their\nown role in organizations. By managers\nreflecting critically about careers, the divi-\nsion between work and non-work, and their\nresponsibility to consider the wider social\nimpact of managerial decisions, management\ndevelopment begins to assume a more sub-\nstantial role in society.\nIf organizations are the dominant influence\nin society, then management development's\neducative role of challenge and critique is of\nparamount importance. This is especially so\nif one considers how secondary and higher\neducation activities are necessarily focused\non developing people who will enter their\ncareers with little organizational influence.\nThe power of managerial ideology that we\nhave explored is too great for an employee's\ncritical facilities to survive the early years of\norganizational life. Therefore, the greatest\nimpact on the status quo may be best made\n(initially at least) from within organizations\nby management development. The role of\nmanagement development, therefore, be-\ncomes one of challenging normative control\nrather than reinforcing it.\nAll this represents a sophisticated man-\nagement development process, which is far\nremoved from the competency approach\nwhich occupies much of the current re-\nsources in management development. It is,\ntherefore, necessary to ask some serious\nquestions about whether this is remotely\nachievable or not. How might this new role\nfor management development emerge? What\nare the forces which might encourage a\nchange in the prevailing institutional tem-\nplate? What will happen if management\ndevelopment is unable to respond to these\nchallenges? It is not the intention here to\ncreate a manifesto which is able to answer all\nthese questions precisely, but to create a\n`` glimpse'' into the future of what might be\nand to encourage further debate and pockets\nof good practice. It is, therefore, useful to look\nforward to the emerging social, technological\nand economic conditions which might influ-\nence the role of management development in\nthe next century to highlight some of the\nchoices open to us.\nFortune telling\nA brief examination of the considerable\nacademic and popular literature available\nabout the world of work and business in the\n`` new millennium'' reveals a time of potential\nupheaval. In a global marketplace, there can\nbe no long-term competitive advantage\n(Drucker, 1997). The trend towards overca-\npacity will encourage the need for constant\ninnovation in order to stay ahead. The\ncontinuing impact of technology will further\nreduce the size of both peripheral and core\nlabour markets and increase the size of the\ndisenfranchised underclass. The manager's\njob will become ever more complex and, as\nmanagers themselves will become a rarer\nspecies, the best managers will be in big\ndemand. In turn, this cadre of `` super man-\nagers'' will be ever more demanding of the\ncompanies for whom they work. The power of\nthese managers will, therefore, become even\ngreater, not just within their organizations,\nbut also in terms of their impact on society.\nIn this context, what might happen to man-\nagement development?\nThese market conditions could encourage\ntwo very different scenarios for the role of\nmanagement development. On the one hand\nthey could foster the destabilization of the\nforces that influence the current role of\nmanagement development. Some organiza-\ntions will simply be unable to respond to\nfuture market conditions if they continue to\npursue a model of organizational change\nwhich is predicated on senior management\ncontrol. In effect, the market will begin to\ncreate a crisis that will leave some organiza-\ntions with no alternative if they are to\ncontinue create wealth for their share-\nholders. Some senior managers will have to\n[ 773 ]\nMartin Clarke\nManagement development: a\nnew role in social change?\nManagement Decision\n37\/10 [1999] 767\u00b1777\nstop managing control processes and start\nleading by creating conditions in which\npockets of change may occur. In these\norganizations there could, therefore, be a\nstrong pull for management development to\nadopt more educative values of critique and\nchallenge. But this in turn will create a\ntension, as the criticism challenges the\nprimacy of those shareholders' demands. The\nonly way to reform the existing power\nrelations will be to implicitly question\nthe assumptions upon which they are\nfounded.\nAlternatively, future market forces may\nwork to reduce the potential influence of\nmanagement development. We have dis-\ncussed the dominance of existing power\nrelations within organizations at some length\nalready, but it is still pertinent to ask why, if\nthe top-down approach still prevails, there is\nlikely to be change now. Even given the\ncontext described above, it is not hard to\npredict an alternative viewpoint in which a\nsmaller and influential group of managers\nbecomes ever more focused on the relentless\npursuit of profit, rationalized through the\nexisting priorities of technical and instru-\nmental reason. These managers would be\nincreasingly seen as heroes who provide the\nkey to a good society (Alvesson and Willmott,\n1996). In this scenario of increasing techno-\nlogical sophistication there would be an even\nbigger rift between core and peripheral\nworkers in which the periphery would be\ntreated as an ever more instrumental source\nof temporary labour. Core employees would\nbe entrapped through more sophisticated\nprocesses of `` cultural doping'', providing the\nillusion of autonomy and independence.\nCompany-sponsored management develop-\nment would continue as a process of norma-\ntive control with little chance of breaking out\nof its own self-serving need for organizational\ncredibility (Clarke, 1999).\nFrom a critical theory standpoint, this\nscenario would produce even greater levels of\nconsumerism, waste, alienation and social\ncontrol. Whether the fabric of our present\nsocial values would be able to bear the\ntensions that this bleak scenario describes\nis, for the moment, unknown. So what\nfactors might influence the realization of\nthe first scenario at the expense of the\nsecond?\nFirst, the work of social commentators and\norganizational `` gurus'' may play some part\nin encouraging the necessary destabilization\nby raising the profile of the value of educa-\ntion for organizational survival. For exam-\nple, Handy (1997), Senge (1997) and Drucker\n(1997) all point to a different business para-\ndigm in which the management of society's\nknowledge resources will become of critical\nimportance. For Drucker, education will\nbecome society's key resource for developing\nnew concepts, methods and practices. While\nsome of these ideas are maybe, merely,\nunwittingly recasting existing organizational\ncontrol mechanisms, these ideas line the\nairport bookstands that are targeted at\nexecutives. Some could have a positive\nimpact on the logic of the institutional\nforces that determine the current role of\nmanagement development by at least raising\nvaluable questions in the mind of the execu-\ntive.\nMore important influences, however, could\nlie in the supply side of the equation. But\nthrough what processes might a more edu-\ncative management development be deliv-\nered? If management development\nprofessionals within organizations have\nbeen largely unable to break out of the\nexisting organizational control mechanisms,\nwho will build subversive capabilities in\nmanagement? While there are many\nrestrictions in which much publicly\nfunded management education is confined\n(Twomey and Twomey, 1998; Willmott, 1994),\nthere are opportunities for those employed\nwithin business schools who also engage in\ncompany sponsored management develop-\nment to be influential too. By pursuing\nmanagement development approaches like\nthose described by Clarke (1998), and Butcher\net al. (1997) and to a certain extent Reynolds\n(1998), `` micro emancipation'' may be en-\ncouraged. These forms of management inter-\nvention can form their own pockets of good\npractice in creating organizational pockets of\ngood practice. As in an organizational set-\nting, these exemplar approaches to manage-\nment development will need to be subversive,\nundermining the status quo whilst meeting\nthe formal success criteria required by\ncompanies for such interventions. In other\nwords organizations may get more than\nthey bargained for from such development\nactivities.\nIn the medium term, these subversive\napproaches to company-sponsored develop-\nment may act as role models for other\nactivities and link with other pockets of like-\nminded academics and practitioners through\nwriting, listening and critical action learning\napproaches (Alvesson and Willmott, 1996).\nAnd, as with organization change, these\nmicro processes of change may also influence\nthe prevailing institutional template. As with\norganizational pockets of good practice these\nattempts to initiate change from below,\nagainst the dominant majority may be suc-\ncessful because they work (Berger and\nLuckman, 1996, p. 137). While the academic\n[ 774 ]\nMartin Clarke\nManagement development: a\nnew role in social change?\nManagement Decision\n37\/10 [1999] 767\u00b1777\ncommunity is far from being perceived as\nhomogeneous and consistent, individual\npockets of activity may be seen as credible\nbecause they work within the existing\ninstitutional template. This will be achieved\nby exploiting loopholes and contradictions\nwithin existing power relations to create\nsome degree of increased autonomy and\nresponsibility for those senior managers who\ncan make an impact on competitive advan-\ntage and organizational democracy (Alvesson\nand Willmott, 1996).\nHowever, such supply side, micro pro-\ncesses of change are unlikely to move in-\nstitutional templates on their own without\nregulatory or governmental support\/demand\n(Johnson et al., 1997). There is a need for\nother, significant, institutional processes to\nfacilitate the embedding of core educational\nvalues in management development. Univer-\nsity business schools clearly have a role but\nso do industry and other government pres-\nsure groups. If subversive action can influ-\nence some senior manager role models, then\nperhaps this may in turn stimulate `` think\ntanks'' and industry pressure groups etc. to\nwiden the debate. For example, environmen-\ntal, gender and racial interest groups who\nalready lobby for regulation in their area of\ninterest may also see the need for lobbying\nfor regulatory changes in the educational\ncontent of management development. This\nwould allow their interests to be surfaced and\nexplored at the point at which they are\nrelevant for the managers who either impli-\ncitly or explicitly collude to maintain the\nstatus quo.\nAs the influence of pockets of micro\nemancipation grow, there will be a raised\nconsciousness about wider issues of corpo-\nrate social responsibility that moves beyond\nthe role of public relations because it takes\ninto account the true nature of the game in\nwhich managers find themselves. In turn this\nconsciousness may force a renewed ques-\ntioning about the fundamental assumptions\nbehind the capitalist philosophy; profit for\nwhom? competition to what end? growth for\nwhat purpose? As organizations become ever\ndominant there will be an increasing push to\nalign primary and secondary education with\nbusiness needs. If management development\ncan assume a broader educative role in\nsociety then perhaps these questions may\nencourage business leaders to influence\nwider national curricula etc. However, all of\nthis remains speculation. Whether this germ\nof change can be really built into such wider\neducational frameworks and thus effect a\nlong term change in social values, remains to\nbe seen.\nConclusion\nWhat is clear is that management develop-\nment does have an impact well beyond the\nclassroom. As the guardian of managerialism\nand technical rationality, management de-\nvelopment currently impacts all of our lives,\ninside and outside of organizations. Given\nthis pivotal role it could also become an agent\nof social change and, therefore, warrants\nmuch closer attention by practitioners and\nacademics. If organizations are to respond\ndifferently to the challenges of capitalism,\nthen where will the impetus for innovation\ncome from, if not from activities such as\nmanagement development? Management de-\nvelopment must be potentially the most\neffective form of intervention for influencing\norganizational norms because it can take\nplace within the lived reality of those man-\nagers who need to acquire a wider education\nabout the social impact of their actions.\nIf organizations continue to act as the\ndominant influence on society then it is vital\nthat this influence is informed by a critical\nand reflective educational process which is\nas far as possible free of the influence of a\ndisproportionate distribution of power in\nsociety. Conventional wisdom has cast man-\nagement development in a role which has an\nemphasis on trust and collaboration. Yet this\nwisdom has often neutered management\ndevelopment's influence as this approach is\nnot always seen as credible by hard bitten\nline managers. A more subversive approach\nwhich encourages pockets of good practice to\nchallenge the status quo may be more\nappropriate. A cynical perspective may be a\nvital starting point in raising the necessary\ncritical facilities for this because it is part of\nthe managers' everyday reality of organiza-\ntional life. Without the challenge that this\ncritical view brings we risk the danger of\ntotalitarianism. By encouraging moments of\nmicro emancipation, management develop-\nment can begin to fulfil a wider educative\nrole of promoting challenge and alternative\norganizational viewpoints.\nAll of this is, of course, fraught with\nsubstantial dilemmas, barriers and assump-\ntions. It is not my intention here to paint a\npicture of management development as some\nsort of white knight coming to the rescue of\nthe alienated and downtrodden. Micro pro-\ncesses of change are not capable of over-\nturning institutional templates on their own\n(Johnson et al., 1997), they will need to be\naugmented by larger scale regulatory frame-\nworks. But they can initiate a wind of change\nprecisely because they `` can have more direct\nrelevance to the lived experience of people\nwho are continually engaged in local\n[ 775 ]\nMartin Clarke\nManagement development: a\nnew role in social change?\nManagement Decision\n37\/10 [1999] 767\u00b1777\nstruggles'' (Alvesson and Willmott, 1997, p.\n176). The object here has been to provide a\nview of how management development might\nbe able to play a very different role in\norganizational change by adopting more\nsubversive and critical values, but in doing\nso it will implicitly raise difficult issues of\npower and control to the surface. This could\nprovide an opportunity for management\ndevelopment to fulfil a more substantial\neducative role in social as well as organiza-\ntional change. Whether this role is one which\nmight facilitate increasing control of indivi-\ndual freedom or increasing democracy is a\nmatter for personal critical reflection. This\nindividual reflection will generate questions\nwhich deserve a full debate in organizations,\nin academia and in government.\nReferences\nAlvesson, M. and Willmott, H.
