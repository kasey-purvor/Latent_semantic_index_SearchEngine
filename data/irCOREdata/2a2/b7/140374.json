Variations in surface and sub-surface structure influence the\nphotochemical processes. Here we show that crystallography, and hence remnant polarization, of the\nferroelectric affects photo-deposition. The ratio of metal growth on c- and c+ domains varies from 1:2\nfor [100] to 1:100 for [111]. This is shown to be dependent on the variations in the band structure.\n2Key words: PZT, photochemistry, nanometal\nThe desire to produce highly defined and well controlled metal nanostructures has been an area of\nresearch that has been gaining interest. Such metal nanostructures have a wide variety of applications\nthat range from interconnects for nanoelectronic devices1 and sensors for biological systems2. One\ntechnique that has been increasingly investigated over the past 5 years is ferroelectric lithography,\nwhich was first reported by Giocondi and Rohrer3 in 2001 and then further investigated by Kalinin et\nal4 where the term ferroelectric lithography was first used. Since that time further work has shown that\nsurface features on the ferroelectric5, energy of irradiation6 and defect density7 can all affect the\ndensity and morphology of metal nanoparticles produced by photoexcitation of the ferroelectric.\nWhere it is possible to reproduce with good fidelity a nanostructure, there exists an opportunity to\ngenerate a nanolithographic technique. Where this is not possible there may exist a method to produce\ninteresting nanostructures that can subsequently be removed and be useful elsewhere. Previously it has\nbeen shown that ferroelectric materials can be made with surface features as fine as 7nm with good\nstructural control8,9.\nWhen the bulk of a ferroelectric is broken by an interface such as a surface or grain boundary a\ndepolarization field forms. Two possible screening processes can occur to produce an energetically\nstable state; one internal, the other external to the material. If we thinking of lead based ferroelectrics\nsuch as lead zirconate titanate (PZT) as wide bandgap semiconductors10,11 rather than pure insulators\nthen we are able to describe the behaviour of the material in terms of standard semi-conductor theory4.\nThe work by Kalinin et al4 and Giocondi et al3 show that band bending due to the ferroelectric nature\nof the material has a major impact on the photochemical reactions that take place on the surface..\nThere is, however, one factor that must be considered; domain dependant polarization effects.\nFerroelectric materials such as PZT have a macroscopic polarization that induces the accumulation or\ndepletion of charges at the surfaces. In positive domains, a positive polarization charge is present at\nthe surface of the material. Internal screening takes the form of a space-charge region forming due to\n3band bending when in close proximity to the interface. The polarization of the surface of the\nferroelectric is dependant on the orientation of the ferroelectric domain due to the dipole developed in\nthe distorted crystal lattice. Previous work has commented that the space charge region does not form\ncomplete screening of the internal dipole12. Therefore an external mechanism exists, which consists of\nthe adsorption of foreign charged molecules at the surface. This is described by classic Derjaguin,\nLandau, Verwey, Overbeek (DLVO) theory and is the Stern layer associated with charged surfaces. In\nboth types of domain, the polarization field is cancelled at equilibrium by the screening mechanisms.\nWhen the ferroelectric is exposed to high energy ultraviolet light, electron-hole pairs formed near or\nwithin the space-charge region are driven apart by the internal electric field.13 Mobile electrons are\nthen forced to migrate to the surface of positive domains14 and towards the bulk in negative domains.\nIf a positive domain is immersed in a metal salt solution such as AgNO3 and exposed to ultraviolet\nlight, the accumulated electrons below the surface can react with the Ag+ cations in solution. These\nelectrons tunnel across the barrier and reduce the silver cation to form metal atoms that are adsorbed\non the ferroelectric surface. Giocondi et al3 pointed out that the adsorption of the Ag onto the surface\ncannot be ion polarization dependant as the Ag+ ions and the surface of the ferroelectric c+ domain are\nboth positive. This means that the ion should be repelled if the process was polarity driven. The\nsuccessful formation of the silver clusters supports the theories of Zhu and Kalinin. Further work has\nshown that the density of states of the ferroelectric material and the energy of irradiation can impact\non the photochemical deposition process6. By irradiating a sample of PZT with a high dose of high\nenergy photons a different pattern of photo-deposited silver metal was seen to that of a lower energy\nsource6. The differences in the deposition of the silver were explained in terms of the density of states\nof the PZT and changes in the band bending.\nPZT films, with the zirconium\/titanium ratio of 30\/70, were made using sol-gel (maximum\nprocessing temperature of 530\u00baC). The sol was then spin coated onto a prepared substrate, which in\n4our case was 100nm of Pt sputtered onto either [100] MgO or [111] Silicon9. The sample was 1cm2.\nThe PZT films exhibited good [111] orientation if grown on Si or good [100] orientation if grown on\nMgO, orientation as determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and consisted of discrete 70-100nm\ngrains with a random domain orientation, as determined by Piezo Force Microscopy (PFM). The films\nare fully dense, as determined by TEM examination, and show very little texturing in the x\/y plane.\nThe average grain size is 100nm for [111] samples and 200nm for [100] samples.\nPFM was performed using a modified DI 3000 Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) system, the base\nelectrode of the sample was connected to the ground of a signal generator and the conductive\ncantilever connected to the signal output. The signal generator was set to 18 kHz at 3Vpk-pk. In order to\navoid running the tip bias signals though the AFM a cantilever holder was modified to accept a direct\nconnection to the tip via a trailing wire. The output of the AFM was run though an EG+G 7260 lock-\nin amplifier which was then passed back to the AFM for processing. The cantilevers used were\nplatinum iridium coated and had a spring constant of k=1-5 N\/m. Poling of the samples was\nundertaken by connecting the sample base electrode and conductive cantilever to a DC power supply\nset at 10V. For positive domains the tip was connected to the negative and the base to the positive\npower supply terminals and for negative domains they were switched. The samples were imaged using\na Philips XL30 SFEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) in high resolution mode and the beam\nenergy was set at 20keV and the aperture to 3. The samples were fixed to a holder by carbon tape and\nelectrodag used to ground the sample base electrode to the holder.\nFresh solutions of 0.01M AgNO3 were prepared by dissolving the required mass of silver nitrate\n(Aldrich 99.99%) in distilled water. The solution was used as is and the pH was not adjusted. A single\ndrop of approximately 25\uf06dl of solution was placed onto the PZT surface which was then placed into a\n\u2018black out\u2019 box containing the lamp for irradiation. Inside the box the sample was placed onto a peltier\ndevice that kept the substrate temperature to that of room temperature. A \u2018Honle H 400W\u2019 lamp sits\n5directly above the sample and the radiation intensity at the sample is approximately 21mW. The\n\u2018black out\u2019 box is fitted with fans to reduce the temperature in the box which never exceeds room\ntemperature plus 10\u00baC. Irradiation periods of 20 minutes were used during the investigation within\nexperimental conditions there was no noticeable loss of volume for the solution.\nIn our recent work6 we have compared the deposition of silver on a domain patterned thin film PZT\n(70nm) that was grown on a Pt back electrode and was either [111] or [100] orientated. It has been\nknown for some time that PZT grown in various crystallographic orientations has a different remnant\npolarisation. This values associated with PZT are consistently that Pr for [100] is 60% of that for [111]\norientated material15. These experimentally derived figures fit well with the mathematically\ndetermined figures16. The present study is focused on the impact of the differences of remnant\npolarization on the band structure at the surface of the ferroelectric. Experimentally the differences in\nthe band structure are shown through a variation in the rate of deposition of Ag0 where reduction from\nAg+ had occurred. In Figure 1 we show a typical SEM micrograph of the deposition of Ag on the\nsurface of patterned PZT. Figure 1 (a) shows a 70nm PZT film with the crystallographic orientation\n[100] that has been irradiated under silver nitrate for 20 minutes. The boundary between the c- and c+\ndomain is clearly defined in the image. Figure 1 (b) shows a 70nm PZT film with the crystallographic\norientation [111], once again irradiated in silver nitrate for 20 minutes. There are some striking\ndifferences in the deposition of silver on the PZT surface. In the case of the [100] sample there is good\ndecoration on both the c+ and c- domains. However, on the surface of the PZT [111] there is no visible\ncoverage on the c- surface whereas the c+ surface is covered in silver. In all cases the presence (or\nabsence) of silver was determined using energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX). We have shown in\nprevious work that the growth rate of silver nanoparticles is strongly dependent on the surface features\nof the ferroelectric5. In this case the probability of an electron tunnelling and reacting with a silver\ncation is the likely rate determining step. The lack of a barrier on the c+ domain means that the rate of\nsilver growth is similar for both surfaces studied. However, the variation in the band structure does\n6mean that the silver grows to an average particle size of 118nm on c+ [100] and 93nm, on c+ [111].\nThere is a larger difference in the size of the silver nanoparticles on the c- ranging from no deposition\n([111]) to a deposition of particles with an average diameter of 56nm ([100]). The variation in\ndeposition rate on the c- domain is representative of the lower probability of the electron crossing the\nbarrier and reacting with a silver cation.\nThe differences in deposition on the PZT surface can be explained in terms of the modification of\nspace charge layer (SPL) due to the variation in the remnant polarisation of the sample. If it is\nassumed that there is incomplete internal charge screening, described as type 2 screening by Kalinin\nand Bonnell17 and that charge screening is completed using external charges then the shape of the SPL\nvaries due to the change in remnant polarization.\nIn the surface of a ferroelectric, there are two main sources of charge: the polarization charge (QP)\nand the charge due to surface states (QT). The effective charge on the surface QS is the sum of these\ntwo contributions with their respective signs, QS=QP+QT. The presence of this surface charge induces\na space-charge region under the surface, with an associated band bending. The direction of bending\n7depends on the sign of the surface charge QS. Another compensation mechanism for this superficial\ncharge is the adsorption of charged molecules from the surroundings.\nThe sign of the polarization charge depends on the polarity of the domain, being positive for c+\ndomains and negative in c- domains. Oxygen vacancies are mostly responsible for the surface states,\nas they are invariably introduced during the annealing of the film.7,18 Oxygen vacancies are donor-like,\nrepresenting a positive charge at the surface.19 Therefore, QT is positive in both c+ and c- domains.\nAccording to these considerations, the sign of the surface charge QS is as indicated in Table 1..\nAs PZT is a p-type material, the positive surface charge QS induces a hole depletion area and a\ndownwards band bending below the surface of positive domains, as shown in Figure 2. This situation\nhas been described in the literature as an inversion region in which PZT presents n-type behaviour20.\nElectron-hole pairs generated through illumination in the depletion region of the ferroelectric are\nseparated by the electric field; holes are driven towards the bulk, and electrons travel to the surface,\nwhere they can take part in electrochemical reactions due to the absence of a potential barrier. This\neffect has been reported in the literature6,7.\nAccording to Table 1, in negative domains the sign of the surface charge depends on the balance\nbetween the surface state charges and the polarization charges. The two possibilities are illustrated in\nFigure 3. Figure 3 (a), in which |QP|<QT and QS>0 is equivalent to that described for positive domains.\nHowever, as reported in a previous work6, strong illumination at energies in excess of the bad-gap\nenergy is required in order to obtain silver deposition in c- domains. This suggests that the situation\ndepicted in Figure 3 (a) is unlikely and that shown in Figure 3 (b) is the more likely situation.\n8In the case of Figure 3 (b), the negative polarization charge is not fully compensated by the surface\nstates, and QS<0. At the outside, a layer of positively charged adsorbates adhere to the surface. At the\ninside, the negative surface charge induces a hole accumulation region below the surface, and the\nbands are bent upwards. Under these conditions, there is a barrier for electrons at the surface of the\nferroelectric that blocks the silver photo-reduction reaction. Under intense over band-gap illumination\nit is possible to reduce the width of hole accumulation layer enough as to enable electron tunnelling\nand silver reduction in negative domains6. However, the experimental results presented earlier (Figure\n1) show that deposition on the c- domains only happens for the [100] orientation and at a substantially\nreduced rate than in c+ domains.\nThe experimental evidence found for c- domains in [100] and [111] orientations is explained here in\nterms of their differences in remnant polarization. Reported figures of QP for thin film sol-gel PZT\n[100] and [111] orientations15 are typically in the order of 14 \u03bcC\/cm2 and 21 \u03bcC\/cm2 . An increase in\nthe negative surface charge QS translates into a small increment in the width of the space charge\nregion. But even this small difference can have a substantial impact in the number of electrons\nreaching the surface as the penetrability of the barrier varies exponentially with its width (see\n9Figure 4). A simple calculation can illustrate this point. Ignoring the contribution of external ions, the\nwidth of the space charge region w can be approximated by:\nA\nS\nqN\nQ\nw \uf02d\uf03d\nwhere NA is the hole density in the bulk and q is the elementary charge. The height of the barrier can\nbe considered the same for both [100] and [111] orientations, due to the pinning of the Fermi level at\nthe surface.23 The penetrability T of a barrier of height E and width w can be calculated approximately\nby:21\nweT \uf0612\uf02d\uf0bb\nmE2\n1\n\uf068\n\uf03d\uf061\nA change \u2206QS in surface charge from QS1 to QS2 will induce a change in the width of the barrier\ngiven by:\nA\nS\nA\nSS\nqN\nQ\nqN\nQQ\nwww\n\uf044\uf02d\uf03d\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\uf02d\uf03d\uf044 1212\nwhich implies a change in the barrier penetration given by:\n\uf028 \uf029w\nT\nT \uf044\uf0d7\uf03d \uf0612exp\n2\n1\nThe difference in surface charge between [100] and [111] PZT is:\nQS[111]-QS[100]=QP[111]-QP[100]=-7\u03bcC\/cm2\nUsing the values NA=1020cm-3 (ref. 22) and E=1eV (ref. 23), the changes in barrier width and\npenetrability are \u0394w=6.8\u00c5 and T[100]=3.39\u00b71019\u00b7T[111]. Therefore, in negative domains the\nprobability of electron tunnelling, and consequently of silver photo-reduction, is around 1019 times\nsmaller in a [111] orientation than in a [100]. The explanation given to this effect also suggests that,\nunder more intense illumination, it should be possible to obtain silver reduction in the [111] c-\norientation, but so far it has not been achieved.\n10\nIn conclusion we have shown that variations in the remnant polarization of the ferroelectric can\nhave a marked impact on the semi-conducting nature of the material as measured using reduction of\nsilver nitrate to silver on the surface. The small variations in the field associated with the domain\nstructure of the ferroelectric, in association with the low number of carriers available in the system\nwas found to be responsible for the changes in silver metal deposition.\nReferences\n1 Wissner-Gross, A.
