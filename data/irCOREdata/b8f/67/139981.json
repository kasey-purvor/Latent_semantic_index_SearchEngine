It has long been recognized that hydrostatic pressure \naffects the behaviour of polymers [1-3]. The main effect observed is an increase in modulus \nand yield stress. A linear pressure dependency of shear yield stress \u03c4 has been proposed [1] of \nthe type : \n\u03c4=\u03c4\u03bf +\u00b5p  (1) \nwhere \u00b5 is a coefficient dependent on the polymer and p is the hydrostatic pressure. \nModification of ductile-brittle transitions may also be observed as craze formation is \nsuppressed at high pressure. Strain to failure may increase or decrease.  Several studies have \nalso been performed to evaluate the influence of pressure on the mechanical properties of \npolymer matrix composites [4-10], at pressures up to 7000 bars (700 MPa). Typical modulus \nvariations with pressure for unidirectional composites are increases of a few percent per 100 \nMPa pressure increase. Tensile strength tends to decrease with increasing pressure [4,5] and \nthis has been related to increased matrix yield stress and reduced toughness. In contrast \ncompression strength generally increases with increasing hydrostatic pressure [6-8], and the \nfailure mechanisms have been shown to change at high pressures. In-plane shear properties \nalso improve with increasing pressure but the fibre orientation has been shown to affect the \ndegree of improvement [9].  A review by Hoppel et al summarized data on hydrostatic \npressure effects published before 1995 [10] and concluded that more experimental and \ntheoretical research was needed in this area.  \nAll the composite work described above has focussed on in-plane properties. However, failure \nin composite structures is frequently caused by interlaminar crack propagation (delamination) \nand if deep sea structures are to be optimized the influence of hydrostatic pressure on the \ninterlaminar fracture toughness should also be quantified. Very little work has been published \non out-of-plane behaviour of composites in this context. A recent paper by Rhee presented \nresults from compressive fracture tests in a pressure vessel on unidirectional carbon\/epoxy \ndog-bone specimens containing implanted film defects [11]. A 32% increase in Gc was \nmeasured for an increase in pressure from atmospheric to 200 MPa. At low pressures multiple \ndelaminations were noted whereas at higher pressure a single crack propagated. These results \nare interesting but the change in the failure mode and the mixed mode loading make analysis \nin terms of Mode I and Mode II fracture toughness difficult. A special test set-up has therefore \nbeen developed at IFREMER to enable such pure loading tests to be performed.  \nInterlaminar fracture toughness tests have been performed for many years but have only \nrecently been standardized [12]. Mode I testing is now routinely performed using the double \ncantilever beam specimen (DCB) [13]. Mode II testing is more controversial and no standard \ntest method exists yet, but the four point ENF specimen proposed by Martin and Davidson \n[14] appears quite attractive, combining a simple test fixture with stable crack propagation. \nIn the present paper Mode I DCB and Mode II 4ENF tests have been performed on \nunidirectional carbon\/epoxy specimens, in water, in a pressure vessel at pressures of 4, 300 \nand 900 bars. Pressure is related to the water depth by the expression: \np = 0.101*H + 0.5*10-6*H\u00b2  (2) \nwhere p = pressure in bars and H = immersion depth in metres. \nThese pressures therefore correspond roughly to surface, 3000 metres and 9000 metres depth, \nthus covering virtually all the possible sea applications (with the exception of the deepest \nmarine trenches in which depths descend to over 11 000 metres). \n MATERIALS \nThe materials tested are made from Cytec IM7\/977-2, an intermediate modulus carbon fibre \nreinforced toughened epoxy resin. Unidirectional specimens were produced from prepreg in \nan autoclave at Cranfield University. The specimens were de-bulked and cured under 6 bar \npressure, in a single ramp 180\u00b0C cure.  Specimens were nominally 3 mm thick and 20mm \nwide. Starter cracks were obtained by placing a 10 \u00b5m thick PTFE film at laminate mid-\nthickness during lay-up. \n \n \nTEST PROCEDURE \n \nSpecimens were tested in a 1000 bar pressure vessel mounted on a standard 20 ton capacity \nelectromechanical test frame. Figure 1 shows an overall view of the test set-up. The load cell \nis outside the pressure vessel. As the friction between the loading piston and the vessel body \nis significant at the low loads applied during Mode I tests, all the specimens were \ninstrumented with strain gauges and a calibration procedure enabled load cell measurements \nto be checked, as discussed below.  \nFigure 2 shows the loading fixtures for the Mode I and Mode II tests. For the former \naluminium blocks were bonded to the specimens for load introduction. For the latter the \ndistance between the upper loading points was 60 mm and the distance between the lower \nsupports was 100 mm.  A roller bearing is positioned so that the upper load points rotate about \nthe specimen mid-thickness. The pressure vessel was closed, filled with tap water and \npressurised. Strain gauge readings were allowed to stabilise before the tests were performed \nunder displacement control at 2mm\/min for Mode I, 1 mm\/min for Mode II. A digital pressure \ntransducer was used to record pressure and these data, together with the load cell output, \ncrosshead displacement and strain gage readings were recorded on a PC-based acquisition \nsystem for subsequent analysis. \n \nThe determination of GC values requires knowledge of three of the four parameters: load, \ndisplacement, crack length and modulus. For tests performed inside a pressure vessel analysis \nis complicated by two factors. First, the load cell of the test machine is located outside the \npressure chamber.  Because of the friction in the seals of the chamber and the relatively low \nloads expected, it was not possible to use the machine load cell directly to measure the load \napplied to Mode I specimens.  In order to overcome this problem, all samples were \ninstrumented with strain gauges. For Mode I tests the gauges were located on one of the DCB \narms, for Mode II tests they were bonded to the lower surface of the specimen at mid-span. \nThese strain gauges can be calibrated to act as load cells when the location of the strain gauge \nand specimen geometry are measured accurately (see Appendix). As strain gauges are \nsensitive to temperature and pressure readings were allowed to stabilise before starting to load \nthe specimen. The second specific difficulty is that it is not easy to determine the crack \nlengths visually. Crack lengths were therefore back-calculated using the measured specimen \ncompliance and assuming that the axial modulus of this material is independent of pressure \nover this range. This assumption is supported by published data [10] and by values measured \nfor compliance at different pressures during fracture tests. In addition, for pressures up to 30 \nMPa view-glasses enabled specimens to be filmed during part of the tests, so that some \ncalculated crack lengths and measured displacements could be checked. Figure 3 shows an \nexample of the field of view for a Mode II test. The Mode I data analysis is performed using \nEquation (3) for initiation values and Equation 4 for propagation: \n \n02\n3\nba\nPGIC \u03b4=     (3) \n \n3\n2\n1\n2\n2\n31\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b=\nIE\nP\nb\nGIP\n\u03b4    (4) \nThe derivation of these equations is given in the Appendix. The term E1I was measured for \neach half specimen using the ASTM D 790 three point bend test protocol. The validity of the \nload\/strain relationship (equation A3) was checked by performing load\/unload cycles in the \nlinear elastic regime on an Instron 4302 test machine equipped with a 500 N load cell.  Figure \n4 shows an example of the test-calculation comparison. \n \nIn Mode II testing the load and crosshead displacement were recorded continuously, together \nwith the strains at the centre of the specimen on the lower (tension) face. The loads are around \n20 times higher in Mode II than Mode I and there is much less error in the load cell \nmeasurements due to friction, but displacement values were considered to be more reliable \nthan force as they could be checked directly by measurements of movements made through \nthe view-glass up to 30  MPa. Figure 5 shows an example of the machine crosshead \ntransducer versus image analysis measurement correlation. It is clear that the values are very \nsimilar, hence the recordings of the crosshead transducer were used in subsequent analyses. In \nthis case the strain measurements enable the exact point at which the specimen loading begins \nto be identified. The expression generally employed to determine GIIC values is an \nexperimental compliance calibration. As crack length could not be followed visually at the \nhighest pressures (the view-glasses were only qualified for use up to 300 bars) an analytical \nexpression was required. Such expressions have been proposed in the published literature \n[14,15] but their full derivations are not given. An analytical expression was derived here \ntherefore, in order to determine GIIC and GIIP , Equation (5) : \nIE\nL\nb\nPGIIC\n1\n22\n32\n3\n2\n=   (5) \n The derivation of this equation is given in the Appendix. \n \nRESULTS \n \nMode I \nFigure 6 shows three examples of load-displacement plots from the fifteen DCB tests \nperformed (3 at 0.4MPa, 5 at 30MPa and 7 at 90MPa).  A small drop in the load is visible just \nafter the end of linearity point showing that the crack initiation is slightly unstable, in spite of \nusing a starter film of thickness within the ISO recommendation (<12 microns).  The crack \ninitiation values are shown in Table I and it is clear that pressure has little effect on Mode I \ninitiation.   Figure 7 is a plot of the average Mode I resistance curves obtained by analysing \nthe data using eq.3 and eq.4.  For each specimen, the term EI was measured independently in \nthree point flexure.  Table I also shows mean values of the crack propagation resistance GIP \ntaken at a crack length a = 55mm and the minimum and maximum values obtained.  It is \nnoticeable that the mean GIP decreases very slightly with increasing pressure, by around 10% \nfor an increase of pressure from 4 to 900 bars. \n \nMode II   \nTwelve Mode II specimens were tested, 3 at 0.4MPa, 5 at 30MPa and 4 at 90MPa. Figure 8 \nshows an example of the load-displacement plots recorded at each pressure. Once again the \ncrack initiation is unstable and higher GIIC values are measured at initiation than during \nsubsequent propagation. Values decrease towards a stable plateau. Figure 9 shows examples \nof the Mode II resistance curves. Table 2 presents the results obtained, for initiation and \npropagation. There is a significant increase in both initiation and propagation resistance \nvalues with increasing pressure. Values at 300 bars are 18% higher than those at 4 bars. At \n900 bars initiation values increase by a similar amount while propagation values are 25% \nhigher than those at the lowest pressure. \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nThe values obtained from these tests are given in Tables 1 and 2 and summarised in Figure \n10. Under Mode I loading there may be a small decrease in the fracture toughness but the \ndrop is similar to the scatter in values and cannot be considered to be significant. Under Mode \nII loading there is a more significant influence of pressure. One possible reason for this is the \ninfluence of pressure on the friction between the two sliding surfaces. Friction forces will be \ndirectly proportional to the applied lateral pressure on the specimen faces so the work \nrequired to overcome these would be expected to increase the measured value of GIIC.  \nOn a practical level it is apparent from these results that within experimental scatter there is \nno detrimental effect of hydrostatic pressure on either Mode I or Mode II interlaminar fracture \ntoughness for this carbon\/epoxy material and for the range of pressures of interest for deep sea \nstructures. This suggests that standard tests may be used to provide conservative values in the \nevaluation of the damage tolerance of composites for these applications \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nThe present paper describes tests performed in a specially designed test fixture which allow \nhydrostatic pressures up to 1000 bars to be applied during standard mechanical tests. \nInterlaminar fracture tests under Mode I and Mode II loadings performed at 4, 300 and 900 \nbars pressure have revealed little influence of pressure on Mode I fracture toughness of \ncarbon\/epoxy specimens. Mode II delamination resistance was increased by up to 25% for an \nincrease in pressure from 4 to 900 bars. \n \nThese results suggest that data from standard laboratory tests can be used to provide \nconservative values in the damage tolerance design of these materials for deep sea \napplications.  \n  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was performed at IFREMER Brest Centre within the European METRI (Marine \nEnvironment Tests and Research Infrastructure) programme.

Appendix: Data Analyses \n \nMode I \nLoad determination \n \nUsing simple beam theory and stress analysis of a beam in bending, we have:  \nI\nhxMxb 2\n)()( \u2212=\u03c3   (A1) \nPxxM \u2212=)(    (A2) \nHere )(xb\u03c3  is the bending stress at the surface of the beam, M(x) is the bending moment at a \ndistance x from the loading point, P is the applied load, I is the second moment of inertia and \nh the half thickness of the DCB beam.  Consider x to be the distance between the strain gauge \nand the loading point and E1 is the flexural modulus of the beam, the applied load was \ndetermined from the strain gauge using the following relation: \n\u03b5\nxh\nIEP 12=    (A3) \n \nCalculation of GIC \nThe general expression of the energy release rate GC is given by Williams [16]: \na\nC\nb\nPGC \u2202\n\u2202=\n2\n2\n   (A4) \nAs in the previous section, P is the load applied to the sample, b the width of the sample, a the \ncrack length and C is the compliance and is equal to C=\u03b4\/P with \u03b4 being the opening \ndisplacement. \nHowever, using simple beam theory in the case of the double cantilever beam, the compliance \nof the specimen can be expressed by the following equation: \nIE\na\nbhE\naC\n1\n3\n3\n1\n3\n3\n28 ==     (A5) \nand   \na\nC\nIE\na\na\nC 32\n1\n2\n==\u2202\n\u2202    (A6) \nalso   \n3\n1\n1\n2\n3 \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b= ICEa   (A7) \nFinally, G can be expressed as a function of P and d (and for any given time) by: \n( )\n3\n2\n2\n3\n13\n2\n3\n2\n3\n4\n3\n2\n3\n122\n2\n31\n2\n3\n3\n23\n2\n3\n2 \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b==\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b==\nEI\nP\nbEIb\nP\nEI\nP\nPb\nP\na\nC\nb\nPGIP\n\u03b4\u03b4\n\u03b4\n\u03b4   (A8) \nFor the same time the crack length can be estimated using (A9): \n3\n1\n1\n2\n3 \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b=\nP\nIEa \u03b4    (A9) \nThese expressions enable GIP values versus crack length to be determined. The initiation \nvalues are calculated using the usual beam theory \no\nIC ba\nPG 2\n3 \u03b4=     (A10) \nThe correction factors F and N suggested in ISO15024 [13] were not used in the study as it is \na comparative study.  The crack length correction factor \u2206 cannot be determined as no visual \ncrack length measurement was available (see [13] for more details). \n \nMode II \n \nIntroduction definition of the problem. \n \nThe notations used to carry out the analysis are described in Figure A1.  In the following \nsection, y is the deflection of the beam, x is the long axis of the beam, parallel to the crack \nplane. \nFor clarity: ( ) ( )xy\nx\nxy \u2032=\u2202\n\u2202   and ( ) ( )xy\nx\nxy \u2032\u2032=\u2202\n\u2202\n2\n2\n \n \nThe aim of the calculation is to determine the deflection \u03b4 at the centre of the loading cradle \nwhich is the mid- point between B and D. \n \nIn order to simplify the calculations, the coordinate system will be centred at the crack tip \n(point C in Fig. A1).  The deflection \u03b4 of the beam due to the cross head displacement can be \nexpressed by the following equation: \n \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )[ ]BADEBDAE yyyyyyyy \u2212+\u2212=+\u2212+= 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\u03b4   (A11) \n \nThe beam can now be described as two half beams which can be treated independently.  \n \nCalculation for the 1st half beam crack end: determination of (yA-yB).   \n \nThe shear force T and moment M diagrams are plotted in Figure A2. \n \nDetermination of yAB1 in section [C-B]: \nHere we have )(1 LayLy BAB \u2212\u2032== \u03b8     (A12) \n \nMoment in this section is:  \n4\n)( PLxM =       (A13) \nhere  \n12\n3bhI =   , b is the width and h is the HALF thickness \nTherefore after integration: \n( )\n( )( )LaL\nEI\nPLay\nx\nEI\nPLxy\nEI\nPL\nEI\nxMxy\nB \u2212=\u2212\u2032=\n=\u2032\n==\u2032\u2032\n4\n)(\n4\n)(\n4\n)(\n\u03b8\n   (A14)  (A15)  (A16) \nFinally: \nEI\nLaPLyAB 4\n)(2\n1\n\u2212=       (A17) \n \nDetermination of yAB2: in section [B-A] \nWe have ( )xLPxM \u2212=\n4\n)(      (A18) \nTherefore by integration of the beam equation similar to eq.A14, we obtain: \n \n \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b==\n34\n)(\n3\n2\nL\nEI\nPLyyAB     (A19) \n \nand ( ) ( ) \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212=\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212+=\u2212 La\nEI\nPLLaLL\nEI\nPyy BA 3\n84\n1634\n2\n2\n3\n  (A20) \n \n \nCalculation for the 2nd half beam crack end: determination of (yE-yD).   \nThe problem is very similar to the calculations carried out for section [AB], however, the load \napplied is P\/2. \nand here: IhbI 8\n12\n)2( 3* ==      (A21) \n \nDetermination of yDE1 in section [C-D] \nHere we have )(1 LaSyLy DDE \u2212\u2212\u2032== \u03b8    (A22) \n \nMoment in this section is:  \n2\n)( PLxM =      (A23) \nStandard beam theory gives:  \nEI\nxM\nEI\nxMxy\n8\n)()()( * ==\u2032\u2032    (A24) \n \nTherefore after integration, using the same methodology used in eq.A14 to eq.A16 we \nconclude that: \nEI\nLaSPLyDE 16\n)(2\n1\n\u2212\u2212=      (A25) \n \nDetermination of yDE2: in section [D-E] \nWe have ( )xLPxM \u2212=\n2\n)(      (A26) \nTherefore after integration of the beam equation we get: \n \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b==\n316\n)(\n3\n2\nL\nEI\nPLyyDE      (A27) \n \nAnd ( ) ( )\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u2212+=\u2212 LaSLL\nEI\nPyy DE\n2\n3\n316\n  (A28) \n \n \nCalculation of \u03b4 and the compliance C: \nUsing equations A11, A20 and A28, we obtain: \n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +\u2212=\n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u2212+\u2212=\nSLa\nEI\nPL\nLaSLa\nEI\nPL\n3\n103\n32\n3\n2\n3\n84\n162\n1\n2\n2\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n   (A29) \n \nThe compliance is given by: \n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +\u2212== SLa\nEI\nL\nP\nC\n3\n103\n32\n2\u03b4\n    (A30) \n \nAlso \nEI\nL\na\nC\n32\n3 2=\u2202\n\u2202\n      (A31) \n \nFinally, the Mode II delamination toughness is defined by: \n \nEI\nL\nb\nPGIIC 32\n3\n2\n22\n=       (A32) \n \nIf the flexural modulus is known, the crack length can be calculated using eq (A33): \n \n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u2212+=\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u2212+= SL\nPL\nEISL\nL\nEICacal 3\n1032\n3\n1\n3\n1032\n3\n1\n22\n\u03b4  (A33) \n  \n \n1.
