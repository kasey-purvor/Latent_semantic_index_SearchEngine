I'm glad to say that Gabriel Jacobs will\nremain involved with the journal as Executive Editor. The new Editor is David Squires\nfrom King's College London but he will not be able fully to take over until the next issue. I\nhave been appointed as Deputy Editor.\nLooking back over the past editorials and journal editions, it is clear that there are a\nnumber of recurrent themes. The issue of learning technology as a valid research area and\nhow it can be counted in the next RAE, integration into mainstream teaching and learning\n- shifting from the innovators to the majority, and commitment from senior management\nand formulation of policy and strategy. These themes are reflected in the articles in this\nissue, and no doubt will be evident again in the special conference edition (7.1).\nThe question then has to be asked: 'Are we getting anywhere?' or 'Is any of the lobbying\nand research work we are all actively engaged with making a difference?' Some would say\nno - that learning technology still remains at the fringes of teaching and learning, with\nlittle commitment from senior management and poor regard for 'learning technology' as a\ngenuine, valid, 'respectable' area of research. I disagree. Whilst I think we still have a long\nway to go, the increase in the presence of learning technology within higher education has\nrisen dramatically in the last five years. For example, most universities now have some form\nof central-, faculty- or school-based support specifically concerned with the use and\nintegration of learning technologies. I suspect it is a common agenda item at senior\nmanagement meetings on a regular basis in many universities (that is certainly the case in\nmy own university). The potential (and importance) of communications and information\ntechnologies was reiterated throughout the Dealing report and - more recently - in the\nGovernment's proposals for a National Grid for Learning. Credit for all of this must in\npart be given to those at the ground level, i.e. ALT members, who continue to lobby and to\nevaluate the effect of learning technologies and to research new ways of using it. So I think\nwe deserve a pat on the back - while the war is not won (yet), the battles are going well!\n2\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\nThis issue is fundamentally reflective in nature. Many of the points raised above are\ndiscussed. Hawkridge's paper reflects on the validity of using Web pages to support\nlearning, and in particular looks at issues of quality. Brown goes to the heart of the issue of\nembedding learning technologies through appropriate strategy and policy by outlining how\nDe Montfort have been 'reinventing the university' through their electronic campus\nproject. The remaining four papers outline case studies illustrating the use of specific\ntechnologies within a teaching context. Duncan et al. deal with how they have been using\nvideo-conferencing to share a series of short lectures between several universities.\nGoodyear and Steeples report on the use of asynchronous multimedia conferencing to\nsupport collaborative continuing professional development. Nicholson reports on the use\nof both the Web and computer conferencing to support teaching and learning. Finally,\nClark et al. give a critical appraisal of the highly successful WinEcon software and its use\nin a first-year undergraduate Economics programme.\nSo we are moving forwards (even if sometimes it feels like one step forward and two back),\nand it would be fair to say that learning technology is an increasingly important part of\nday-to-day university life. None the less, we still have a long way to go. A significant\nproportion of academics still need convincing of the usefulness of learning technologies,\nand many more need to be shown how they can be used. Academics and senior\nmanagement need ongoing evidence of the educational and cost benefits. Many of the\ntechnologies we are dealing with are still in their infancy; we have barely scratched the\nsurface of their potential. ALT-J has an important role to play in this, by publishing the\nlatest case studies on innovation and evaluation, and by providing a voice for key activists\nand innovators. The next great challenge will be to ensure that the journal reaches\nmainstream teaching staff and senior management.\nGr\u00e1inne Conole\nMay I take this opportunity of thanking Gr\u00e1inne Conole for her work in putting this issue\ntogether? As readers of my last editorial will know, I said that it was my last. But there\nwere delays in appointing the new Editor and Deputy Editor, and I almost had to do this\nissue at a very late stage. Dr Conole plugged the gap and saved my skin (if I may be\nallowed, just this once, to mix metaphors). It will seem like a clich\u00e9 to say that I look\nforward to working with the new team. It is nevertheless sincerely felt.\nGabriel Jacobs\n3\n"}
