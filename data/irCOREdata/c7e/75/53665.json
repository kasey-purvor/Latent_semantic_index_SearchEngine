Introduction 39 \n 40 \n The palynofloras of the Lotena Formation of the Lotena Group from the 41 \nNeuqu\u00e9n Basin, Argentina have previously been studied by Volkheimer and 42 \nQuattrocchio, (1981), Quattrocchio and Sarjeant (1992), Mart\u00ednez and Quattrocchio 43 \n(2003; 2004) and Zavala et al. (2003). The Lotena Formation is of Mid-Late Jurassic 44 \nage; more specifically Callovian-Oxfordian (Howell et al., 2005, fig. 3; Fig. 1). This 45 \ncontribution represents a restudy of some of the material of Quattrocchio and Sarjeant 46 \n(1992) and Mart\u00ednez and Quattrocchio (2004) (Fig. 2), and an interpretation of the 47 \ndinoflagellate cyst assemblages in terms of their detailed biostratigraphy and 48 \npalaeogeographical significance. Quattrocchio and Sarjeant (1992) is largely on 49 \nsystematics and Mart\u00ednez and Quattrocchio (2004) is mainly focused on palynofacies. 50 \n 3 \nGlobal palaeogeographical aspects were not considered in detail by either Quattrocchio 51 \nand Sarjeant (1992) or Mart\u00ednez and Quattrocchio (2004). The aims of this study are to 52 \nrefine the biostratigraphy, and to compare the dinoflagellate cysts of the Lotena 53 \nFormation with coeval associations from other regions. Specifically, the latter goal 54 \nseeks to determine whether these marine palynofloras have closer affinities with the 55 \nwestern Tethys including the Subboreal Realm or with eastern Tethys\/Australasia. 56 \n 57 \n 58 \n2. Geological Background 59 \n 60 \n The geological evolution of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin was largely controlled by 61 \ntectonic events on the western margin of Gondwana. Following initial extensional 62 \nrifting during the Late Triassic, back-arc subsidence was initiated during the Early 63 \nJurassic due to the development of a subduction zone (and an associated magmatic arc) 64 \nin western Gondwana. Thus, in western South America, subduction of Pacific oceanic 65 \ncrust along the north-south trending continental margin of Chile and Argentina 66 \naccelerated significantly during the breakup of West and East Gondwana during the 67 \nEarly Cretaceous. Andean subduction therefore took place under extensional conditions, 68 \nand was probably associated with negative trench roll-back. This lead to the formation 69 \nof a magmatic arc along the Coast Ranges from southern Peru to central Chile and, to 70 \nthe east, the Arequipa, Tarapac\u00e1 and Neuqu\u00e9n extensional back arc basins (Mpodozis 71 \nand Ramos, 2008). 72 \n The Neuqu\u00e9n Basin is located immediately to the east of the Andes Mountains in 73 \ncentral western Argentina and eastern Chile between 31\u00b0S and 41\u00b0S (Figs. 1-3). It lies 74 \nwithin the Argentine provinces of La Pampa, Mendoza, Neuqu\u00e9n (from which it takes 75 \n 4 \nits name) and R\u00edo Negro. The depocentre represents the southern end of the more 76 \nextensive Chilean Basin, is broadly triangular in outline, up to 700 km in a north-south 77 \ndirection and covers over 150,000 km2. The tectonic history of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin 78 \nconsists of synrift (Late Triassic-Early Jurassic), postrift\/back-arc (Early Jurassic-Early 79 \nCretaceous) and foreland stages (Howell et al., 2005, fig. 3). The basin fill is of Late 80 \nTriassic to Palaeocene age, and is between 4,000 and 7,000 m of heterolithic marine and 81 \ncontinental strata (Ramos, 1998; Howell et al., 2005). The majority of the Neuqu\u00e9n 82 \nBasin fill was deposited during the postrift phase; this comprises the Cuyo, Lotena and 83 \nMendoza groups of Pliensbachian to Barremian age (Vergani et al., 1995; Howell et al., 84 \n2005, fig. 3). 85 \n The strata of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin are mostly shallow marine, related to a 86 \nprolonged connection with the palaeo-Pacific. However, marine influence was 87 \nperiodically interrupted due to falls in sea-level (Mutti et al., 1994). These short-lived 88 \nperiods of terrestrial deposition are normally indicated by regional-scale angular 89 \nunconformities which are indicative of tectonic overprints on eustatic changes. 90 \nTransgressive successions were deposited above these unconformities, indicating 91 \nprogressive increases of accommodation space. The Lotena Group (Fig. 1) represents 92 \nthe second oceanic incursion into the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin. The basal hiatus significantly 93 \naffected the overlying units (Zavala, 2002). This group largely comprises Middle 94 \nCallovian and Oxfordian siliciclastic units with subordinate carbonates and evaporites 95 \n(Fig. 3). The thickness of the Lotena Group is highly variable, ranging from as little as 96 \nseveral metres to 650 m in the Sierra de la Vaca Muerta (Zavala, 2005). It 97 \nunconformably overlies the continental and marine deposits of the Cuyo Group, and is 98 \nin turn overlain by the Mendoza Group (Fig. 1). 99 \n 5 \n The Lotena Group in the Sierra de la Vaca Muerta and Covunco areas in the 100 \nsouthwest of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin consists of six unconformity-bounded sequences. The 101 \noldest of these, Sequence 1, comprises the red beds and evaporites of the T\u00e1banos 102 \nFormation, and unconformably overlies the Cuyo Group with transgressive onlap. The 103 \nLotena Formation is dominated by mudstone with subordinate evaporites, limestones 104 \nand sandstones: it comprises sequences 2 to 5. These are broadly similar and exhibit a 105 \nbasal unit of confined shelfal sandstone lobes, which grade upwards into unconfined 106 \nshelfal sandstone lobes and carbonates. The basal confined shelfal sandstone lobes are 107 \nrestricted to areas where the successions are thickest. The youngest Sequence (6) is 108 \nequivalent to the La Manga Formation and exhibits an irregular facies architecture 109 \nwhich truncates the underlying deposits. It is almost entirely composed of massive 110 \ncarbonates that were deposited by turbidity currents. Facies analysis and mapping 111 \nindicate the reworking of older units. The Lotena Group in the Sierra de la Vaca Muerta 112 \nand adjacent areas probably accumulated in a tectonically unstable region. Sequences 4-113 \n6 show a northward shift of their depocentres and widespread truncation along the 114 \nsouthern margins. The truncation may be related to intermittent uplift associated with 115 \nthe synsedimentary development of the Covunco anticline (Zavala, 2005). 116 \n 117 \n3. Material studied 118 \n 119 \n The three samples from the Lotena Formation analysed in this study are from the 120 \nsouthern part of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin (Fig. 2). The slides are housed in the Laboratory of 121 \nPalynology, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bah\u00eda Blanca, Argentina. 122 \n 123 \n 6 \n3.1. Samples 2971 and 2970 from Puente del Arroyo Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa of Quattrocchio 124 \nand Sarjeant (1992) 125 \n 126 \n Samples 2971 and 2970 were collected by Dr. Wolfgang Volkheimer from a 127 \nprominent outcrop at the Puente del Arroyo Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa, where Nacional Route N40 128 \ncrosses the Arroyo Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa, around 40 km south of Zapala (Fig. 2). At this locality, 129 \nthe lower part of the Lotena Formation comprises 59 m of dark green mudstones with a 130 \nbasal conglomerate (Quattrocchio and Sarjeant, 1992, fig. 4). The samples 2971 and 131 \n2970 are from 12 m and 34 m from the base of the lower conglomerate unit respectively 132 \n(Quattrocchio and Sarjeant, 1992, fig. 4). This mudstone-dominated unit has yielded the 133 \nammonite Rehmannia (Loczyceras) patagoniensis, foraminifera and ostracods (Dellap\u00e9 134 \net al., 1979). Rehmannia (L.) patagoniensis is present at the base of the succession and 135 \nis considered to be Mid to Late Callovian in age (Groeber et al., 1953, Stipanicic, 1969; 136 \nRiccardi et al., 1990). Riccardi (2008) stated that R. (L.) patagoniensis is indicative of 137 \nthe Mid Callovian Jason and Coronatum chronozones. 138 \n 139 \n3.2. Sample 1525 from Portada Covunco of Mart\u00ednez and Quattrocchio (2004) 140 \n 141 \n Sample 1525 of Mart\u00ednez and Quattrocchio (2004) is by far the most 142 \npalynologically productive of the three horizons studied by Mart\u00ednez and Quattrocchio 143 \n(2004) from the Lotena Formation of the Portada Covunco section, around 20 km from 144 \nZapala (Fig. 2). Here the formation is approximately 220 m thick and corresponds to 145 \nunits 2 and 3 of Zavala et al. (2002). The sample is a massive dark grey mudstone from 146 \nUnit 2. No ammonites have been recorded from the Lotena Formation of the Portada 147 \nCovunco section. However, the underlying Lajas Formation of the Cuyo Group has 148 \n 7 \nyielded the ammonite Eurycephalites cf. vergarensis, which is characteristic of the 149 \nVergarensis Chronozone, which is of Early Callovian age (Riccardi et al., 1989; 1990; 150 \nRiccardi, 2008). 151 \n 152 \n4. Description of the palynomorph assemblages 153 \n 154 \n The three samples restudied here yielded moderately abundant palynomorph 155 \nassociations. The species recorded, and others discussed herein, are listed in Appendix 156 \n1; their distribution and abundances are recorded in Table 1. A selection of 157 \ndinoflagellate cysts are illustrated in Plate I. The assemblages are dominated by pollen 158 \ngrains with lesser proportions of dinoflagellate cysts. The pollen genus Classopollis is 159 \nprominent; other pollen taxa recorded include the saccate forms Alisporites spp., 160 \nAraucariacites spp. and Callialasporites spp. (Table 1). The dominance of Classopollis 161 \nis indicative of arid conditions. This is especially the case for samples 2971 and 2970 162 \nfrom Puente del Arroyo Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa, which is more proximal than Portada Covunco 163 \n(Martinez and Quattrocchio, 2004; Table 1). Classopollis was produced by 164 \nrepresentatives of the Cheirolepidaceae, and the parent plants were thermophylic and 165 \nxerophytic. They preferred dry coastal regions (Pocock and Jansonius, 1961; Srivastava, 166 \n1976), which is consistent with the palaeolatitudinal position of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin 167 \nduring the Jurassic (Smith et al., 1994). Miscellaneous microplankton, including 168 \nacritarchs and prasinophytes, and pteridophyte spores are also present in relatively 169 \nminor proportions. This palynomorph spectrum is indicative of an offshore shelfal 170 \ndepositional setting. 171 \n 172 \n5. Biostratigraphy 173 \n 8 \n 174 \n5.1. Samples 2971 and 2970 from Puente del Arroyo Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa of Quattrocchio and 175 \nSarjeant (1992) 176 \n 177 \n The dinoflagellate cyst assemblages in samples 2971 and 2970 (see Table 1) are 178 \nentirely consistent with a Callovian age when compared to European assemblages. The 179 \nprominence of Nannoceratopsis pellucida in 2971, together with the presence of forms 180 \nsuch as Chytroeisphaeridia chytroeides, Ellipsoidictyum gochtii, Gonyaulacysta 181 \njurassica subsp. adecta, Meiourogonyaulax sp., Mendicodinium groenlandicum, 182 \nPareodinia ceratophora, Sentusidinium spp. and Tubotuberella dangeardii is typical of 183 \nthe Callovian of northwest Europe and adjacent areas (e.g. Riding, 1982; 1987a; 2005; 184 \nBerger, 1986; Smelror, 1988a;b; Prauss, 1989; Feist-Burkhardt and Wille, 1992; 185 \nSmelror and Below, 1992; Poulsen, 1996; Riding and Thomas, 1997). The presence of 186 \nLimbodinium absidatum and Wanaea acollaris in sample 2971 refines this assessment 187 \nto the Late Callovian. Limbodinium absidatum is confined to the Late Callovian-Early 188 \nOxfordian interval (Athleta to Coronatum chronozones) (Riding 1987b; Riding and 189 \nThomas, 1992). The range top of Wanaea acollaris is within the Late Callovian 190 \n(Riding, 1984); the few, sporadic reports of this species in the Early Oxfordian are 191 \nthought to represent contamination (Riding and Thomas, 1997). No exclusively 192 \nOxfordian markers such as Leptodinium spp. and Systematophora spp. were observed. 193 \nThe presence of Ambonosphaera? staffinensis in the Callovian is unusual; the range of 194 \nthis species is Mid Oxfordian to Early Cretaceous (Poulsen and Riding, 1992, fig. 2). 195 \n A single specimen of Protobatioladinium cf. P. lindiensis Schrank 2005 was 196 \nrecorded in sample 2971. Protobatioladinium lindiensis was originally described from 197 \nthe Tithonian of Tanzania, and similar forms are present in the Bathonian-Ryazanian 198 \n 9 \ninterval of Europe and Israel (Schrank, 2005). Dissiliodinium volkheimeri is confined to 199 \nthe Southern Hemisphere. It was recorded from the Bathonian and Callovian of offshore 200 \nnorthwestern Australia by Mantle (2009a). Quattrocchio and Sarjeant (1992, p. 70) 201 \nstated that Dissiliodinium volkheimeri is conspecific with Dissiliodinium sp. (no 202 \nantapical node) of Helby et al. (1987), from the Bajocian-Bathonian of Australia. 203 \nHowever, this contention is not supported here because Dissiliodinium volkheimeri has 204 \na thin autophragm and has extremely low-relief ornamentation. By contrast, 205 \nDissiliodinium sp. (no antapical node) of Helby et al. (1987) has an irregular reticulate 206 \nornamentation and is smaller. Endoscrinium cf. E. galeritum 1967 subsp. reticulatum is 207 \napparently endemic to the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin. 208 \n The Late Callovian age of sample 2971, 12 m from the base of the succession, 209 \ninferred from the presence of Limbodinium absidatum and Wanaea acollaris is 210 \nconsistent with the occurrence of the Mid to Late Callovian ammonite Rehmannia 211 \n(Loczyceras) patagoniensis in the lowermost bed. This suggests that the majority of the 212 \nsuccession at Puente del Arroyo, Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa is of Late Callovian age. 213 \n 214 \n5.2. Sample 1525 from Portada Covunco of Mart\u00ednez and Quattrocchio (2004) 215 \n 216 \n The relatively low diversity dinoflagellate cyst assemblage in sample 1525 is 217 \nalso consistent with the Callovian Stage. Gonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. adecta is 218 \nprominent, and Chytroeisphaeridia chytroeides, ?Meiourogonyaulax sp., 219 \nMendicodinium groenlandicum and Rynchodiniopsis cladophora are also present. This 220 \nassociation is typical of the Callovian of the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. Riding and 221 \nThomas, 1992; 1997; Riding et al., 1999; Riding, 2005). The presence of Scriniodinium 222 \ncrystallinum refines this assessment to no older than Late Callovian. The range of 223 \n 10 \nScriniodinium crystallinum in the Northern Hemisphere is Late Callovian to earliest 224 \nKimmeridgian (Riding, 1987a; Riding and Fensome, 2002). The questionable 225 \nspecimens of Liesbergia liesbergensis, Trichodinium scarburghensis and Wanaea sp. 226 \nalso support a Late Callovian age assessment. Liesbergia liesbergensis is indicative of 227 \nthe Mid Callovian to earliest Oxfordian interval of Europe (Berger, 1986; Riding, 228 \n2005). Trichodinium scarburghensis is characteristic of the Late Callovian to Mid 229 \nOxfordian (Riding and Thomas 1992). ?Wanaea sp. has a spinose paracingular crest, 230 \nhence is similar to forms such as the Late Callovian to Early Oxfordian marker Wanaea 231 \nthysanota (see Riding and Helby, 2001a). No marker species with range bases within 232 \nthe Oxfordian such as Endoscrinium luridum, Glossodinium dimorphum, 233 \nGonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. jurassica and Wanaea fimbriata were recorded. 234 \n 235 \n6. The provincialism of Jurassic dinoflagellate cysts 236 \n 237 \n Because dinoflagellates are planktonic, their cysts can potentially have wide 238 \nbiogeographical distributions. In the Jurassic several prominent Mid-Late Jurassic 239 \nspecies, such as Gonyaulacysta jurassica, Nannoceratopisis pellucida and 240 \nScriniodinium crystallinum, are known to be distributed globally. However, many other 241 \ntaxa appear to be restricted to northwest Europe\/western Tethys, eastern 242 \nTethys\/Australasia and the Arctic region (Norris, 1975). The Australasian biotic 243 \nprovince is especially well-differentiated, having many endemic taxa (Helby et al., 244 \n1987; Riding and Ioannides, 1996). Typically in the Arctic\/Boreal region, there is a 245 \nmixture of widely-distributed Northern Hemisphere forms and endemic high latitude 246 \ntaxa (Brideaux and Fisher, 1976; Davies, 1983; Smelror and Below, 1992. Riding et al., 247 \n1999). 248 \n 11 \n At certain times during the Jurassic, such as the Bathonian and the 249 \nKimmeridgian\/Tithonian, it is possible to distinguish distinct Boreal (Arctic) and 250 \nwestern Tethyan (Euro-Atlantic) provinces within the Northern Hemisphere (Riding et 251 \nal., 1985; 1999; Riding and Ioannides, 1996). This marked provincialism was most 252 \nlikely due to a number of factors including lithofacies control, nutrient levels, ocean 253 \ncurrents, salinity, seasonality (i.e. winter darkness) and temperature. One of the most 254 \nimportant factors, however, was likely to have been the presence or absence of open 255 \nmarine connections. Organic cyst-producing dinoflagellates prefer shelfal environments 256 \n(Wall et al., 1977). Therefore during periods of high sea levels, when extensive areas of 257 \ncontinental shelf are flooded, dinoflagellates are passively dispersed over very wide 258 \nareas. The Callovian and Oxfordian interval was a time of rising and relatively high sea 259 \nlevels (Ager, 1981; Haq et al., 1987). Consequently, dinoflagellate cyst associations are 260 \nextremely similar in taxonomic spectrum and relative proportions in this interval 261 \nthroughout the equatorial, middle and high latitudes throughout the Americas, the Arctic 262 \nand western Tethys (Johnson and Hills, 1973; Jain et al. 1986; Garg et al., 1987; 263 \nSmelror, 1988a,b; Thusu et al., 1988; Conway, 1990; Poulsen, 1996; Riding et al., 1999; 264 \nIbrahim et al., 2002). This situation suggests significant levels of ocean current activity 265 \nat this time. Such is the relative uniformity of Callovian-Oxfordian dinoflagellate cyst 266 \nassemblages throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere, the Australasian 267 \nphytoplankton province represents a major biotal contrast (Riding and Helby, 2001b; 268 \nMantle, 2005; 2009a,b). 269 \n 270 \n7. Palaeogeographical significance of the dinoflagellate cyst assemblages 271 \n 272 \n 12 \n The dinoflagellate cyst associations from samples 2971, 2970 and 1525 are of 273 \nmoderate to low diversity, and are strongly reminiscent of the Late Callovian floras of 274 \nthe Northern Hemisphere. For example, the previous reports of Ambonosphaera? 275 \nstaffinensis, Ellipsoidictyum gochti, Limbodinium absidatum, Rynchodiniopsis 276 \ncladophora and Wanaea acollaris are all from Europe, North America and adjacent 277 \nregions (e.g. Johnson and Hills, 1973; Feist-Burkhardt and Wille, 1992; Riding and 278 \nThomas, 1992; Riding et al., 1999). By contrast, Chytroeisphaeridia chytroeides, 279 \nMendicodinium groenlandicum, Nannoceratopsis pellucida, Pareodinia ceratophora, 280 \nScriniodinium crystallinum and Tubotuberella dangeardii are global in distribution 281 \n(Davey, 1987; Helby et al., 1987, Mantle, 2009a,b). The only species apparently 282 \nconfined to the Southern Hemisphere is Dissiliodinium volkheimeri. This form has been 283 \nrecorded from the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin and offshore northwestern Australia (Quattrocchio 284 \nand Sarjeant, 1992; Mantle, 2009a). Dissiliodinium is a relatively morphologically 285 \nsimple genus and the majority of the species were described from the Northern 286 \nHemisphere. This implies that Dissiliodinium volkheimeri may not be confined to the 287 \nSouthern Hemisphere. A single specimen of Protobatioladinium cf. P. lindiensis was 288 \nrecorded from sample 2971 (Plate I, fig. 8). Protobatioladinium lindiensis was 289 \ndescribed from the Tithonian of Tanzania, East Africa by Schrank (2005). This species 290 \napparently has a wide distribution; similar forms have been recorded from the 291 \nBathonian to Ryazanian of Europe (Schrank, 2005, p. 72). Endoscrinium cf. E. 292 \ngaleritum subsp. reticulatum (Plate I, fig. 14) is prominent in sample 2971 (Table 1); 293 \nthis morphotype appears to be confined to the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin. 294 \n Significantly, no taxa of exclusively Australasian affinity were observed in this 295 \nstudy. In the Callovian of Australasia, several characteristic and endemic species are 296 \npresent including Endoscrinium kempiae, Meiourogonyaulax penitabulata, 297 \n 13 \nNannoceratopsis reticulata, Paragonyaulacysta helbyi, Ternia balmei, Voodooia 298 \ntabulata, Wanaea digitata, Woodinia pedis and others (Davey, 1987; Helby et al., 1987; 299 \n1988; Riding and Helby, 2001b; Mantle, 2005; 2009a,b). None of these taxa, and other 300 \nendemic Austral forms, have been recorded from the Lotena Formation of the Neuqu\u00e9n 301 \nBasin. Hence, due to the lack of Australasian elements, this assemblage is consistent 302 \nwith a strong marine connection with the Euro-Atlantic province to the north. This 303 \nstrongly implies that the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin was isolated from eastern Gondwana in terms 304 \nof biotal exchange during the Callovian. Australasian dinoflagellate cysts could not 305 \nhave been passively dispersed westwards across the middle latitudes into the Neuqu\u00e9n 306 \nBasin via trans-Pacific routes due to the wide geographical extent of this deep ocean 307 \nbasin, and the active subduction zone immediately to the west of the Americas (Fig. 4). 308 \nSimilarly, latitudinal and palaeotemperature barriers would probably have prevented 309 \ndispersal from Australasia to South America around the southern margin of Gondwana 310 \n(i.e. Australia and Antarctica) via the Southern Gondwanan Seaway (Hallam, 1983; Fig. 311 \n4). 312 \n Similarly, characteristically Arctic\/Boreal Callovian dinoflagellate cyst taxa 313 \nsuch as Evansia dalei, Evansia perireticulata, Paragonyaulacysta calloviensis and 314 \nParagonyaulacysta retiphragmata have not been observed in the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin. These 315 \nspecies were cold-adapted Arctic forms (e.g. Johnson and Hills 1973; D\u00f6rh\u00f6fer and 316 \nDavies 1980; Smelror and Below, 1992). The absence of these forms indicates that 317 \npotential southerly dispersal routes via the high northerly palaeolatitudes into the 318 \nHispanic Corridor were not viable for cyst-forming dinoflagellates. 319 \n In the western Tethys (i.e. eastern North America and North Africa) Jurassic 320 \nbiotas, including dinoflagellate cysts, were markedly different from their counterparts 321 \nfrom southeastern Tethys (Australasia, eastern Asia and northeast India). Central 322 \n 14 \nsouthern Tethys (i.e. East Africa, India and Madagascar) appears to have supported a 323 \nmixed assemblage, with both European and Austral dinoflagellate cysts being present 324 \n(e.g. Jiang et al. 1992, Garg et al. 2003, Msaky, 2007). During the Triassic and Jurassic, 325 \nthe Tethys circumglobal current (TCC) flowed westwards in the tropics and north-south 326 \ncurrents during such greenhouse intervals tended to be relatively weak (Bush, 1997). 327 \nThus, the westward flow of the TCC would have potentially been responsible for the 328 \ndispersal of planktonic organisms from eastern to western Tethys during the Mesozoic. 329 \nDespite this, endemic Australasian dinoflagellate cyst taxa have not been observed west 330 \nof East Africa. Interruptions in shelfal seas, water stratification and\/or other constraints 331 \napparently prevented the westward dispersal of Austral dinoflagellate cysts during the 332 \nJurassic. Aberhan (2001) discussed bidirectional (seasonal) biotic exchange across the 333 \nHispanic Corridor during the Mid Jurassic driven by the establishment of a 334 \nmegamonsoonal ocean circulation. 335 \n The characteristically European affinity of the Callovian dinoflagellate cysts 336 \nfrom the Lotena Formation of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin is entirely consistent with the 337 \npalaeogeography inferred from other fossil groups. The Hispanic Corridor or Caribbean 338 \nSeaway represented a relatively narrow open marine connection from western Tethys 339 \nsouthwestwards across Central America into western South America in the Mid and 340 \nLate Jurassic (e.g. Hallam, 1983, fig. 1; Irurralde-Vinent, 2003, fig. 1; 2006, fig. 1; Fig. 341 \n4). This seaway first opened during the Early Jurassic (Aberhan, 2001), and would have 342 \nallowed the free interchange of marine biotas between the western Tethys and the 343 \nNeuqu\u00e9n Basin from the Mid and Late Jurassic (Bathonian to Oxfordian). Contiguous 344 \nshallow marine siliciclastic facies were present throughout the Hispanic Corridor during 345 \nthe Oxfordian (Irurralde-Vinent, 2003). This study strongly indicates that this open 346 \nseaway was present during the Late Callovian (Fig. 4). Some studies have stated that 347 \n 15 \nthis connection was not fully established until the Late Jurassic (e.g. Irurralde-Vinent, 348 \n2006, fig. 2). Previously, Pangea represented a major barrier to free movement of 349 \nmarine waters and biotas in the equatorial region. Van de Schootbruge et al. (2005) 350 \npostulated that the possible opening of the Hispanic Corridor may have caused the 351 \nradiation in cyst-forming dinoflagellates during the Early Jurassic (Late Sinemurian and 352 \nLate Pliensbachian). The passive dispersal facilitated by the opening of this seaway 353 \nwere probably driven westwards through the Hispanic Corridor on the circum-Tropical 354 \nMarine Current (Parrish, 1992; Irurralde-Vinent, 2006), and interchanged with the 355 \nNeuqu\u00e9n Basin via the western margin of South America. However, it is also possible 356 \nthat some marine connections were present between South America and Africa via the 357 \nMozambique Corridor (Longshaw and Griffiths, 1983, fig. 4). 358 \n Musacchio (1979; 1981) reported diverse associations of benthonic foraminifera 359 \nand ostracods from the Lotena Formation. The foraminifera are cosmopolitan, and are 360 \nsimilar to coeval faunas from northern Europe. This is consistent with a marine 361 \nconnection via the Hispanic Corridor. Boomer and Ballent (1996) concluded that the 362 \nsimilarities between Early to Mid Jurassic marine ostracod faunas from southwest 363 \nBritain, North Africa and the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin indicate westward migration into the 364 \neastern part of the Tethys along the Hispanic Corridor as opposed to via the 365 \nTethyan\/Pacific seaway. This biotic evidence for a marine connection between further 366 \nnorth in the Chilean Basin and into North America, and the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin is consistent 367 \nwith the configuration of shallow marine facies belts. In the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, the area of 368 \nCallovian marine deposition is surrounded by coastal and continental deposits, with 369 \ndefinite closure towards the south (Zavala, 2005, fig. 1; Fig. 3). 370 \n 371 \n8. Conclusions 372 \n 16 \n 373 \n The Lotena Formation of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, Argentina yields low-moderate 374 \ndiversity dinoflagellate cyst assemblages indicative of a Late Callovian age by 375 \ncomparison with northwest Europe. No Australasian or Boreal forms were observed, 376 \nand the floras of the Lotena Formation are extremely reminiscent of coeval Eurasian 377 \nassemblages. This means that there must have been an open marine connection between 378 \nEurope (and adjacent areas) and the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin via the circum-Tropical Marine 379 \nCurrent through the Hispanic Corridor during the Late Callovian. Prior to the Mid 380 \nJurassic, there was no permanent \u2018trans-Pangean\u2019 equatorial seaway which allowed 381 \nbiotal interchange. This conclusion is consistent with evidence from shallow marine 382 \nfacies belts and other fossil groups including foraminifera and ostracods. 383 \n A more comprehensive study of the Lotena Formation at localities such as 384 \nPuente del Arroyo Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa and Portada Covunco should be undertaken. This should 385 \nallow a significant refinement of Callovian\/Oxfordian biostratigraphy and 386 \npalaeogeographical interpretations. 387 \n 388 \nAcknowledgements 389 \n 390 \n This restudy was undertaken during March 2009.
