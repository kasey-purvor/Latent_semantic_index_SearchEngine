Sources include scientific papers, conference 3 \nproceedings, reports to research funders, records of confirmed ozone injury symptoms 4 \nand an international biomonitoring experiment coordinated by the ICP Vegetation.  5 \nThe latter involved ozone-sensitive (NC-S) and ozone-resistant (NC-R) biotypes of 6 \nwhite clover (Trifolium repens L.) grown according to a common protocol and 7 \nmonitored for ozone injury and biomass differences in 17 European countries, from 8 \n1998 to 2006.  Effects were separated into visible injury or growth\/yield reduction.  9 \nOf the 644 records of visible injury, 39% were for crops (27 species), 38.1 % were for 10 \n(semi-)natural vegetation (95 species) and 22.9% were for shrubs (49 species).  Due 11 \nto inconsistencies in reporting effort from year to year it was not possible to determine 12 \ngeographical or temporal trends in the data.  Nevertheless, this study has shown 13 \neffects in ambient air in 18 European countries from Sweden in the north to Greece in 14 \nthe south.  These effects data were superimposed on AOT40 (accumulated ozone 15 \nconcentrations over 40 ppb) and POD3gen (modelled accumulated stomatal flux over a 16 \nthreshold of 3 nmol m-2 s-1) maps generated by the EMEP Eulerian model (50 km x 50 17 \nkm grid) that were parameterised for a generic crop based on wheat and NC-S\/NC-R 18 \nwhite clover.  Many effects were found in areas where the AOT40 (crops) was below 19 \nthe critical level of 3 ppm h. In contrast, the majority of effects were detected in grid 20 \nsquares where POD3gen (crops) were in the mid-high range (> 12 mmol m-2).  Overall, 21 \nmaps based on POD3gen provided better fit to the effects data than those based on 22 \nAOT40, with the POD3gen model for clover fitting the clover effects data better than 23 \nthat for a generic crop.   24 \n 25 \nPage 2 of 74Global Change Biology\n 3 \nIntroduction 1 \n 2 \nConcentrations of ozone in the troposphere have increased over recent decades 3 \n(Vingarzan, 2004, Derwent et al., 2007), with health-based guidelines regularly 4 \nexceeded across much of Europe (Meleux et al., 2007, EEA, 2009).  In addition to 5 \nhealth impacts (described in WHO, 2008), ozone is considered to be more damaging 6 \nto vegetation than any other air pollutant (Ashmore, 2005).  Experimental exposures 7 \nat concentrations that can be experienced in Europe, especially in hot summers like 8 \n2003, have shown that crops and (semi-)natural vegetation could be damaged by 9 \nreduced growth and seed production (e.g. Mills et al., 2007a, Hayes et al., 2007a, 10 \nBooker et al., 2009), premature senescence (e.g.Tonneijck et al., 2004), reduced 11 \nability to over-winter (e.g. Hayes et al., 2006) and withstand stresses such as drought, 12 \n(e.g. Wilkinson and Davies, 2009), and by producing visible injury symptoms such as 13 \nchlorotic and bronze stippling of leaves (e.g. Manning et al., 2002).  Earlier European 14 \nsurveys and biomonitoring experiments conducted during the 1980s and 1990s 15 \nindicated that ambient ozone concentrations were sufficiently high to induce visible 16 \ninjury on over 20 crops growing in countries extending from Sweden in the north to 17 \nItaly and Spain in southern Europe (Benton et al., 2000, Fumagalli et al., 2001).  With 18 \nnorthern hemispheric ozone concentrations predicted to continue to rise, at least for 19 \nthe next few decades (Royal Society, 2008), we undertook a study to review the 20 \nevidence for effects of current ambient ozone on crops and (semi-)natural vegetation 21 \nin Europe over the period 1990 \u2013 2006, and related this evidence to maps being used 22 \nby the LRTAP Convention1 to indicate the areas of greatest risk of effects over these 23 \nyears.  For one biomonitoring system (ozone-sensitive and \u2013resistant white clover, 24 \n                                                 \n1\n Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution \nPage 3 of 74 Global Change Biology\n 4 \ndescribed later) we also related biomass effects and visible injury to site- and year-1 \nspecific modelled ozone parameters that describe both ozone concentration and ozone 2 \nflux (uptake via the stomatal pores on the leaf surface). Thus, we provide here field-3 \nbased biological validation of mapped European ozone risk assessment indices, 4 \ninformation identified as urgently required by both Manning (2003) and Simpson et 5 \nal. (2007).  6 \nThe general increase in ozone concentrations in the Northern hemisphere in recent 7 \ndecades has been associated with a change in the profile of maximum seasonal and 8 \ndiurnal ozone concentrations.  Owing to implementation of precursor emission 9 \ncontrols, peak ozone concentrations in the USA and Western Europe have declined 10 \nfrom 1980 to present, with the decline being less steep in recent years (Derwent et al., 11 \n2007, Vingarzan, 2004, Jenkin, 2008, Lefohn et al., 2008, Solberg et al., 2005).  At 12 \nthe same time, background ozone concentrations have increased due to hemispheric 13 \ntransport of precursors from the developing areas of the world (NEGTAP, 2001, 14 \nDentener et al., 2006).  Looking to the future, significant declines in background 15 \nozone in Europe will only be achievable if strict global controls on ozone precursor 16 \nemissions are implemented (Royal Society, 2008, Dentener et al., 2006).  A 17 \nconfounding factor in predicting future ozone climates is that higher temperatures and 18 \nreduced cloudiness and precipitation as a result of climate change may increase 19 \nsummer peak and average ozone concentrations (Meleux et al., 2007).  Current 20 \npredictions are that by 2030, effects of ground level ozone pollution will have major 21 \nimplications for global food security with global yield losses due to ozone rising to 9 22 \n\u2013 18% for wheat and 4 \u2013 8% for rice under scenarios that allow for implementation of 23 \ncurrent legislation to control pollutant emissions (Van Dingenen et al., 2009).  It has 24 \nalso recently emerged that ozone may reduce the ability of vegetation to absorb 25 \nPage 4 of 74Global Change Biology\n 5 \ncarbon dioxide resulting in even greater carbon dioxide concentrations in the 1 \natmosphere in the future, further increasing radiative forcing (Felzer et al., 2005, Sitch 2 \net al., 2007).  Predictions for the future are complicated by enhanced temperature 3 \nincreasing ozone production over and above that associated with global increases in 4 \nprecursor emissions, and the ameliorating effect of increasing carbon dioxide 5 \nconcentration on ozone effects (by reducing stomatal uptake), see reviews by Booker 6 \net al., 2009, Feng and Kobayashi, 2009.  Within the context of evaluating potential 7 \neffects of ozone in the future, it is timely to synthesise data on the current evidence of 8 \neffects of ozone in Europe on crops and (semi-)natural vegetation, and to draw 9 \nattention to the urgent need to further reduce the emissions of ozone precursors on a 10 \nglobal scale.  11 \n 12 \nA recent synthesis of published dose-response function data from field-based chamber 13 \nexperiments revealed that the most ozone-sensitive crops include wheat, soybean, 14 \npulses and tomato, with potato, sugar beet, rape and maize being moderately sensitive 15 \n(Mills et al., 2007a).  In a similar study for (semi-)natural vegetation, Mills et al. 16 \n(2007b), compiled published dose-response functions for individual species and 17 \nproposed that grasslands (especially uplands, dry grasslands and woodland fringes), 18 \nheaths and wetlands are amongst the most ozone-sensitive habitats in Europe.  19 \nAlthough these compilations of exposure-response data provide an indication of the 20 \nrelative sensitivity of different species, they do not provide actual evidence that 21 \ncurrent ozone climates are damaging vegetation in the open field without any 22 \nconfounding influence of an exposure chamber (as described in Heagle, 1989 and 23 \nSanders et al., 1991).  Field-release studies with ozone are relatively few, and have 24 \nprovided mixed results.  For example, Morgan et al. (2006) found that yield 25 \nPage 5 of 74 Global Change Biology\n 6 \nreductions for soybean were even larger than those predicted from open-top chamber 1 \nexperiments whilst Bassin et al. (2009) found that alpine vegetation was relatively 2 \nresistant to ozone despite the sensitivity of the component species.   3 \n 4 \nSeveral previously un-collated sources of evidence of visible ozone injury in ambient 5 \nair in Europe exist in the literature including surveys of crops and (semi-)natural 6 \nvegetation together with ad hoc observations.  Examples include a survey of ozone 7 \ninjury symptoms on vegetation in an alpine valley (Bussotti et al., 2003b); surveys of 8 \nsymptoms on crops in Belgium, France, Spain and Switzerland (Benton et al., 2000) 9 \nand surveys conducted in countries in the Carpathian mountain range area of central 10 \nEurope (Manning et al., 2002).  Researchers have also reported the presence of visible 11 \ninjury symptoms on crops grown in ambient air plots included as part of open-top 12 \nchamber based ozone exposure experiments (e.g. De Temmerman et al., 2002).  13 \nThese types of  data are useful sources of evidence of ozone effects in the field 14 \nproviding (as in the examples quoted), the assessors of ozone injury are well trained, 15 \nfollow a clearly defined protocol and preferably, that the ozone symptoms have been 16 \nconfirmed using ozone exposure experiments (Bussotti et al., 2006, Lorenz et al., 17 \n2008, Manning and Godzik, 2004).   18 \n 19 \nFurther evidence of ozone effects in ambient air derives from surveys conducted by 20 \nplacing a sentinel bioindicator species of known sensitivity to ozone at a series of sites 21 \nin a local area and assessing the plants for injury symptoms at intervals thereafter.  22 \nOzone-sensitive tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv BELW3) has been used in several 23 \nsuch surveys, particularly in Southern Europe (e.g. Spain, Ribas and Penuelas, 2003 24 \nand Italy, Nali et al., 2006).  Over the last fifteen years, the participants of the ICP 25 \nPage 6 of 74Global Change Biology\n 7 \nVegetation2 have compiled evidence of ozone effects in ambient air by conducting a 1 \nseries of coordinated experiments across Europe with ozone-sensitive- (NC-S) and 2 \nozone-resistant (NC-R) biotypes of a commercial cultivar of white clover (Trifolium 3 \nrepens cv Regal) originally selected in Raleigh, North Carolina (Heagle et al., 1994).  4 \nThe NC-S strain develops ozone injury symptoms following an ambient ozone 5 \nepisode involving ozone concentrations of 50 \u2013 60 ppb and higher, and after 6 \nprolonged exposure to ozone has reduced above-ground growth whilst the NC-R 7 \nbiotype only responds to ozone at substantially higher concentrations.  In addition to 8 \nozone injury data, this biomonitoring system also provides evidence of ambient ozone 9 \neffects of ambient concentrations on biomass \u2013 an effect of potentially greater 10 \nimportance than visible injury.   11 \n 12 \nDuring the last fifteen years, the ozone-effects research community in Europe has 13 \nbeen establishing methods for determining the critical levels for ozone, above which 14 \neffects on sensitive species can be expected.  The overall aim has been to develop 15 \nmethods for mapping the areas of Europe where vegetation is at highest risk of ozone 16 \ndamage.  The resulting maps are used within the LRTAP Convention as part of the 17 \nnegotiations for reductions in emissions of the precursors of ozone from the 51 18 \nsignatories to the Convention (for details, see 19 \nhttp:\/\/www.unece.org\/env\/lrtap\/lrtap_h1.htm).  Contributing countries agree to 20 \nreductions by signing Convention Protocols, the most recent being the Gothenburg 21 \nProtocol (1999) to abate acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone which is 22 \ncurrently under review.  The negotiations concerning ozone for the Gothenburg 23 \nProtocol were based on exceedance of a concentration-based long-term critical level 24 \n                                                 \n2\n The International Cooperative Programme on Effects of Air Pollution on Natural Vegetation and \nCrops \nPage 7 of 74 Global Change Biology\n 8 \nof ozone for crops and (semi-)natural vegetation. This value, an AOT403 of 3 ppm h 1 \naccumulated over three months was set at the Kuopio Workshop in 1996 (K\u00e4renlampi 2 \nand Sk\u00e4rby, 1996) and is still considered to be the lowest AOT40 at which significant 3 \nyield or biomass loss due to ozone can be detected for agricultural crops and (semi-4 \n)natural vegetation dominated by annuals, according to current knowledge (LRTAP 5 \nConvention, 2004).   A critical level for visible injury has also been derived based on 6 \nanalysis of many ozone parameters in the days preceding ozone injury development 7 \non Trifolium subterraneum (Pihl-Karlsson et al., 2004). The \u201cshort-term\u201d critical level 8 \nis a VPD-modified AOT30 (AOT30VPD4) of 0.16 ppm.h accumulated over the eight 9 \ndays prior to injury development (LRTAP Convention, 2004).   10 \n 11 \nRecent research for the LRTAP Convention has led to a new index being developed 12 \nthat has a stronger biological basis than AOT40.  It models the flux of ozone from the 13 \nexterior of the leaf through the stomatal pores to the sites of damage (\u201cstomatal flux\u201d 14 \nor \u201cflux\u201d) using algorithms describing the species-specific effects of temperature, 15 \nPhotosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD), soil water potential, vapour pressure 16 \ndeficit (VPD) and plant growth stage on stomatal functioning (Emberson et al., 2000, 17 \nPleijel et al., 2007).  To date, flux-based critical levels have been derived for wheat, 18 \npotato and provisionally for beech and birch, and flux-based risk assessment methods 19 \nhave been developed for a generic crop and generic tree species for use in large-scale 20 \nintegrated assessment modelling (LRTAP Convention, 2004).  The latter are 21 \nsimplified full flux models that do not take into account genetic variability in 22 \nsensitivity and use only temperature, PPFD and VPD as factors modifying stomatal 23 \n                                                 \n3\n   The sum of the differences between the hourly mean ozone concentration (in ppb) and 40 ppb for \neach hour when the concentration exceeds 40 ppb, accumulated during daylight hours. \n4\n The sum of the differences between the hourly mean ozone concentration (in ppb) modified by VPD \n(using the function described in LRTAP Convention, 2004) and 30 ppb when the concentration exceeds \n30 ppb during daylight hours.   \nPage 8 of 74Global Change Biology\n 9 \nconductance with the notation, PODYgen 5 and units mmol m-2, where Y = 3 for the 1 \ngeneric crop flux model used in this study.

(2007). 5 \nUnfortunately, there is no generally-accepted POD3gen for clover yet, and in any case 6 \nthe environmental and pollution-exposure conditions of potted plants within the ICP 7 \nprogramme differ from those that would apply to homogeneous canopies of clover, 8 \nbut we use here available knowledge to derive a flux estimate for this network. This 9 \nnew index, POD3gen(Clover) is used alongside the more standard AOT40 and 10 \nPOD3gen (Crop) functions in this paper.    11 \n  12 \nRisk maps produced using AOT40 and generic flux (to crops or trees) provide very 13 \ndifferent spatial patterns of ozone impacts (Simpson et al., 2007, Karlsson et al., 14 \n2009). For both metrics, ozone impacts are predicted for southern Europe where 15 \nozone concentrations are highest.  However, risk maps based on generic flux to crops 16 \nindicate effects in central and north-west Europe where lower ozone concentrations 17 \nand AOT40 values below the critical level occur in climatic conditions (moderate 18 \ntemperatures, moist climates) that are conducive to relatively high ozone flux.  In the 19 \ncurrent study, we superimpose maps of ozone effects detected in the field onto 20 \nAOT40- and POD3gen flux-based risk maps (for crops and NCS\/NCR white clover) to 21 \ndetermine whether the more biologically meaningful flux approach is a better 22 \npredictor of vegetation damage than AOT40.  Ideally ozone risk maps should be 23 \ngenerated from measurements of AOT40 and flux, however, measured ozone 24 \n                                                 \n5Accumulated flux above a flux threshold of Y nmol m-2 s-1, accumulated over a defined time period  \nduring daylight hours, using the generic flux model. Note, this index was formerly known as AFstY. \nPage 9 of 74 Global Change Biology\n 10 \nconcentrations are only available from ca. 130 sites in Europe (reported in 1 \nEMEP\/CCC reports available at www.emep.int  such as Fj\u00e6raa and Hjellbrekke, 2 \n2008), and spatial distribution of measurements is not uniform with many parts of 3 \neastern and southern Europe poorly covered. For ozone fluxes, hardly any measured 4 \ndata exist, with just a few research sites providing values (e.g. Tuovinen et al., 2004, 5 \n2007).  Thus, assessment of risk of effects to vegetation is dependant on modelling 6 \nprocedures that can provide a geographically broad-scale prediction of both the 7 \nAOT40 and the POD3gen metrics.  Within Europe, the model of the European 8 \nEvaluation and Monitoring Programme (EMEP) plays a key role in developing air 9 \npollution control strategies for both the LRTAP Convention and the European Union 10 \n(see Simpson et al., 2003 for details).  The model results for AOT40 have been 11 \ncompared with observations in, for example, Fowler et al. (1999) and Simpson et al. 12 \n(2003), and in general fair agreement (R>0.7) was obtained. Far fewer data are 13 \navailable to evaluate the model's flux predictions, but studies by, for example, 14 \nTuovinen et al. (2004) and Klingberg et al. (2008), provide support for the basic 15 \nformulation and deposition rates. The uncertainties associated with the EMEP model 16 \nare considered further in the Discussion. 17 \n 18 \nIn conducting this study, we set out to answer the following questions: How 19 \nwidespread is the occurrence of ozone injury and ozone-induced biomass reduction in 20 \nEurope and which species of crops, (semi-)natural vegetation and shrubs are affected? 21 \nIs there any evidence of temporal or spatial trends in ozone effects as a result of 22 \nchanging ozone profiles? How well do AOT40-based and flux-based maps predict the 23 \nareas where ozone injury and\/or biomass reductions have been detected in ambient 24 \nair? This paper provides an overview of analysis of ozone effects data for the period 25 \nPage 10 of 74Global Change Biology\n 11 \n1990 \u2013 2006; further details including the regional distributions of effects can be 1 \nfound in a report by Hayes et al. (2007b).   2 \n 3 \n 4 \nMaterials and methods 5 \nSources of ozone\u2013effects data 6 \nData were sourced from scientific papers and conference proceedings published up to 7 \n2007 (see Tables 1 - 3), national-scale reports to funders of research (listed in Tables 8 \n1-3 as unpublished), the ICP Vegetation database for the clover experiment (described 9 \nbelow) and specialists that have published papers on ozone effects that had noted 10 \nconfirmed ozone injury symptoms in the field (listed in Tables 1 - 3 as unpublished).  11 \nEach record of an effect was entered into a database together with the species name, 12 \nlocation of species (pot, experimental plot, commercial field, natural vegetation), date 13 \nof observation, nature and extent of effect (injury, biomass or yield), local ozone and 14 \nclimate data if available, grid reference and data source.  Only data with a known grid 15 \nreference were included in the database.  16 \n 17 \nRecords of observations of visible-injury symptoms in ambient air 18 \nRecords of visible injury symptoms attributed to ozone included data observed on 19 \ngrasses, forbs, shrubs and crop species growing in experimental pots or plots, natural 20 \nvegetation communities and commercial crops from surveys conducted during spring 21 \nand summer months over the period 1990 - 2006.  The database includes records of 22 \nvisible injury from biomonitoring experiments conducted for the ICP Vegetation 23 \nusing nine species from 1994 - 1996 (see Benton et al., 2000 for details), and white 24 \nclover conducted from 1996 \u2013 2006 (see below for details).  There are also records 25 \nPage 11 of 74 Global Change Biology\n 12 \nincluded from both unpublished data and ad-hoc observations supplied by ozone-1 \nspecialists that participate in the ICP Vegetation.  Overall, this part of the database 2 \ncontained 644 records, of which 70.6% were published in the scientific literature and 3 \n29.3% were unpublished data.  4 \n 5 \nWith such a diverse dataset, there was a need to apply quality assurance procedures to 6 \nensure the data were comparable.   Records of the highest quality were supplied by 7 \nscientists that have collected seeds or cuttings from species showing injury in the 8 \nfield, grown the species and exposed it to ozone experimentally to confirm the 9 \nsymptoms.   Since such records only accounted for ca. 6% of the data available, 10 \nrecords were also included if collected by scientists who research and publish papers 11 \non ozone pollution effects and therefore are familiar with \u2018typical\u2019 ozone injury 12 \nsymptoms and could confirm that the symptoms seen matched those published 13 \nfollowing ozone exposure of the same or related species.  No symptoms described as 14 \n\u2018possibly\u2019 due to ozone were included in the analysis presented here.  Assessments of 15 \nthe amount of injury per leaf are subject to variation between researchers with 16 \nunderestimates of damage commonly occurring (e.g. Bussotti et al., 2006).   To avoid 17 \nsuch confounding factors when comparing across survey types, ozone leaf injury data 18 \nwere only included if the presence, rather than the extent, of symptoms was recorded.    19 \n 20 \nEvidence of ozone effects from ICP Vegetation biomonitoring studies with white 21 \nclover 22 \nThe ICP Vegetation biomonitoring programme has involved exposure of an ozone 23 \nsensitive (NC-S) biotype of white clover (Trifolium repens L. cv. Regal) to ambient 24 \nair since 1996.  Cuttings of clover were sent by the Programme Coordination Centre 25 \nPage 12 of 74Global Change Biology\n 13 \nat the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Bangor (UK) to participants across Europe, 1 \nwho established the plants according to a standard protocol (see Mills et al., 2000 for 2 \ndetails).  Twenty-eight days after establishing the cuttings, 10 to 25 plants of the NC-3 \nS clover were placed in 15 l pots and exposed to ambient air for four to six months at 4 \neach site.  The date for the start of the exposure varied between sites and between 5 \nyears, according to local growing seasons and experimental needs.  The majority of 6 \nsites began exposure of plants in May or June, and the last assessments were carried 7 \nout in September or October.  Plants were cut back to a height of 7cm every 28 days 8 \nto allow new leaves to develop.  At the time of these harvests, the plants were 9 \nassessed for ozone-specific leaf injury using a common protocol.  Injury was apparent 10 \nin varying magnitudes ranging from pale cream stipples on the leaf surface to large 11 \nnecrotic patches with leaves severely damaged.  For comparison across sites, ozone 12 \ninjury was scored as the percentage of leaves visibly damaged by ozone using the 13 \nfollowing key: 1 = <1% of leaves affected, 2 = 1-5%, 3 = 5-25%, 4 = 25-50%, 5 = 50-14 \n90% and 6 = 90-100%.  At some sites, ozone-resistant plants (NC-R) were also grown 15 \naccording to the same protocol; the ratio of the biomass of NC-S to NC-R 16 \n(accumulated over harvests 2, 3 and 4 representing three months of growth) provided 17 \nan indication of ambient ozone effects on growth at these sites. For those sites visited 18 \ndaily, the date of first appearance of ozone injury symptoms, defined as the date when 19 \n20% of the plants have one or more injured leaves, was recorded.  All data were 20 \nchecked for quality assurance prior to inclusion in the dataset as described in Mills et 21 \nal. (2000). 22 \n 23 \nScored injury data were available from a total of 45 sites, representing 16 countries 24 \nacross Europe from 1998 to 2006 and biomass ratio data were available from 1996 to 25 \nPage 13 of 74 Global Change Biology\n 14 \n2006 for a total of 41 sites from 15 countries (Table 4).  However, each individual site 1 \ndid not necessarily perform the investigation every year meaning there were very few 2 \nsites with a long time-run of data.    3 \n 4 \nOzone risk maps 5 \nThe EMEP Eulerian model maps ozone concentrations and fluxes on an (approx.) 50 6 \nkm x 50 km grid.  Described in detail by Simpson et al. (2003), the EMEP model 7 \nsimulates the emissions, transport, transformation and removal of pollutants, and 8 \nincludes the calculation of ozone fluxes using the Deposition of Ozone and Stomatal 9 \nExchange module (DO3SE, described in Emberson et al., 2000, Simpson et al., 2003, 10 \n2007 and references therein).  For use in this study, the EMEP model generated 11 \nAOT40 values for crops (termed here AOT40 (crop)) and generic crop flux (POD3gen 12 \n(crop)) maps using the methods described in the Modelling and Mapping Manual of 13 \nthe LRTAP Convention (LRTAP Convention, 2004) for the years 1995 through to 14 \n2004, inclusive. Parameterisation of the generic crop flux model is reproduced in 15 \nTable 5. The accumulation period for AOT40 (crop) and POD3gen (crop) was three 16 \nmonths, with the timing of the accumulation window reflecting the period of active 17 \ngrowth of wheat and centred on anthesis (LRTAP Convention, 2004).  This approach 18 \nprovided a moving time interval to reflect the early growing seasons in southern 19 \nEurope and later growing seasons in northern Europe.   The classification scales for 20 \nthe EMEP risk maps presented here have been chosen to provide a fair comparison 21 \nbetween AOT40 and POD3gen maps.  Each map has six categories for values 22 \nexceeding zero, plus a zero category, with the maximum whole number value 23 \nrecorded in any of the years included being divided by six to provide the six evenly 24 \nspaced categories.  25 \nPage 14 of 74Global Change Biology\n 15 \n  1 \nFor this study we have also developed a clover flux model that is specific to NC-2 \nS\/NC-R clover (POD3gen (clover)) as used at the ICP biomonitoring network.  The 3 \nbasic formulation is similar to that of other vegetation but uncertainties are introduced 4 \nin calculating the ozone concentration at the canopy height because the clover plants 5 \nin the ICP Vegetation network were in pots surrounded by short vegetation (grass 6 \nspecies) \u2013 a complex situation for modelling.  Thus, here we have assumed that the 7 \ndominant vegetation is grassland rather than clover itself, with the ozone 8 \nconcentration gradients around the plants being driven more by the surroundings than 9 \nby the characteristics of clover.  On the other hand, the stomatal conductance of the 10 \nclover itself still drives the uptake of O3 into the plant.  In an effort to account for this 11 \ncomplex situation, we calculate the stomatal conductance of clover with clover-12 \nspecific parameters, but make use of the O3 gradients calculated for grassland to 13 \ncalculate the O3 at canopy top. The parameterisations for this model are provided in 14 \nTable 5, with the derivation and equations described in the Annex to this paper.   15 \nClover POD3gen and clover AOT40 maps have been generated for values accumulated 16 \nover 84 days starting 15 June (the mean start date for ICP Vegetation clover 17 \nexperiments) to represent the three 28d growth periods.  Grid square values for these 18 \nmaps are the average of five years data for 2000 \u2013 2004.   19 \n 20 \nComparison of ozone-effects data with EMEP modelled AOT40 and POD3gen 21 \nFour sets of data were compared with EMEP modelled AOT40 and POD3gen maps 22 \nand\/or grid square values.  Firstly, the 50 x 50 km grid squares where visible injury 23 \nhad been detected in published surveys and ad hoc observations and the ICP 24 \nVegetation biomonitoring experiments described here during the period 1995 -2004 25 \nPage 15 of 74 Global Change Biology\n 16 \nwere mapped with the ten year mean values for crop AOT40 and crop POD3gen. For 1 \ngrid squares where an effect was detected in more than one year in the five-year 2 \nperiods, the presence of effect was only counted once.  The second dataset was the 3 \nmean injury score on white clover for the period June to August on NC-S white clover 4 \nover the five-year period 2000 \u2013 2004.  This data were mapped against AOT40 5 \n(clover), AOT40 (crop), POD3gen (clover) and POD3gen (crop) for illustration but 6 \ncould not be used to produce dose-response functions due to the non-linearity in the 7 \ninjury score used in the plant-level assessments.  The third dataset was for a sub-set of 8 \nthe clover biomonitoring sites where the first day of ozone injury was recorded.  9 \nClover AOT40, AO30VPD and POD3gen were calculated for the days from the start of 10 \nthe experiment and the eight days prior to ozone injury for use in an assessment of the 11 \nshort-term critical level for visible injury.  Lastly, the fourth dataset used was the 12 \nwhite clover biomass ratio (NC-S\/NC-R) calculated from the total biomass for the 13 \nmonths May, June and July, normalised for the 1.05 ratio recorded at zero AOT40 14 \n(Hayes et al., 2007b) and converted to percentage biomass reduction.  The five-year 15 \nmean values per site were mapped against the five-year mean crop and clover AOT40 16 \nand POD3gen (2000 \u2013 2004).  In addition, the site- and year-specific values for clover 17 \nAOT40 (clover) and POD3gen (clover) using the site starting date were accumulated 18 \nover 84 days and plotted against biomass ratio.   19 \n 20 \nStatistical analysis 21 \nThe datasets described were deemed too inconsistent for analysis of temporal and 22 \nspatial trends as the number of sites surveyed for injury or included in the clover 23 \nbiomonitoring experiment varied from year to year and were not systematically 24 \nselected for geographical representation.   Response functions were fitted to the 25 \nPage 16 of 74Global Change Biology\n 17 \nbiomass data by non-linear regression within Minitab V.15.  Where applicable, data 1 \nare presented visually for four regions of Europe Northern Europe (NE), Atlantic 2 \nCentral Europe (ACE), Continental Central Europe (CCE), Mediterranean (Med), 3 \nwith countries included in each region as listed in LRTAP Convention (2004).   In 4 \nTables 1-3, the Mediterranean region is split into eastern and western Mediterranean.   5 \n 6 \nResults 7 \nVisible injury surveys, including injury occurrence on experimental ambient air plots 8 \nOver the years 1990 \u2013 2006, ozone injury was detected in 16 countries of Europe 9 \nrepresenting each of the five geographical regions studied (Tables 1 - 3 and Figures 1-10 \n3).  Records of injury were particularly common from Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, 11 \nbut were also common for more northern countries such as Belgium and Sweden.  12 \nOverall, ozone injury was most commonly reported in central and Mediterranean 13 \nEurope with more than 200 published records available for each of these regions, with 14 \nfewer records reported in ACE and NE.  There were large year-to-year differences in 15 \nthe number of published and unpublished records reported across Europe (Figure 2).  16 \nSince this inconsistency may well have reflected the sporadic nature of surveys rather 17 \nthan fluctuations in ozone climate, it was not possible to statistically analyse this 18 \ndataset for any geographical or temporal trends.  Instead, the focus of the analysis of 19 \nthe visible injury dataset has been the overall geographical spread of sites where 20 \ninjury occurred together with the range of species injured in each region, based on the 21 \ncombined records for the period 1990 - 2006.        22 \n 23 \nOf the 644 records of visible injury over the period 1990 \u2013 2006, 39% were for crops, 24 \n38.1 % were for forbs and grasses, and 22.9% were for shrubs.   Overall, 27 crop 25 \nPage 17 of 74 Global Change Biology\n 18 \nspecies exhibited visible injury including agricultural crops such as maize, potato, 1 \nwheat, durum wheat and soybean, and horticultural crops such as lettuce, chicory, 2 \nradish, courgette and onion (Table 1).  These effects were detected in 14 countries 3 \nrepresenting each of the five geographical regions. Ten or more crops were injured in 4 \nGreece, Italy and Spain and it is also of note that ozone injury was detected on six 5 \ncrop species in Sweden (NE).     6 \n 7 \nNinety-five species of grasses and forbs exhibited typical ozone injury in ambient air 8 \nat sites across Europe (Table 2).  Overall, the vast majority of the species injured were 9 \nforbs, with injury being more difficult to identify on grasses and only reported for 8 10 \nspecies.  Species from the same genus were injured at sites in several countries.  For 11 \nexample, Centaurea jacea was injured in Poland, Switzerland and Italy, Centaurea 12 \nnigra was injured in Italy, UK and Ukraine, Centaurea paniculata was injured in 13 \nSwitzerland and Centaurea scabiosa was injured in France and the Ukraine.  In 14 \naddition to the Trifolium spp. used in the ICP Vegetation biomonitoring programme, 15 \nother examples of genus\u2019 that were well represented within the database were Rubus 16 \nspp, with injury recorded on five species growing in France, Switzerland, Italy and 17 \nSpain and Epilobium spp. with three species injured in France, Spain and Italy.     18 \n 19 \nOzone injury was reported for 49 species of shrubs growing in France, Italy, Poland, 20 \nSpain and Switzerland (Table 3).  Records for Viburnum spp. were the most 21 \nwidespread with injury occurring on four species at sites in France, Italy, Spain and 22 \nSwitzerland.  Rosa canina was injured in three countries (Italy, Spain and 23 \nSwitzerland) whilst many other species were injured in two countries such as 24 \nLonicera caprifolium, Robinia pseudoacacia and Sambucus racemosa.   25 \nPage 18 of 74Global Change Biology\n 19 \n 1 \nThe geographical distribution of locations in Europe where visible injury was detected 2 \nand published in the scientific literature over the period 1995 \u2013 2004 is shown in 3 \nFigure 3 superimposed on the 10 year average for AOT40 (crop) and POD3gen (crop).   4 \nThere was a clear north-south increase for AOT40 (crop), with the highest modelled 5 \nvalues being found in Italy, whilst POD3gen (crop) was > 18 mmol m-2 across a large 6 \nregion of Europe covering central and southern areas and spreading northwards into 7 \nsouthern UK and Scandinavia.  Overall, 62%  of injury locations were in grid squares 8 \nwith AOT40 (crop) values below the critical level of 3 ppm h to protect crops against 9 \neffects on biomass and yield suggesting that some effects (even if not on biomass and 10 \nyield) can occur well below this value (Figure 3).  No obvious threshold value was 11 \napparent but most grid squares (29%) were in the category 2 - 3 ppm h for AOT40 12 \n(crop).   In contrast, only 9% of the injury locations were found within grid squares 13 \nwith an POD3gen (crop) of < 12 mmol m-2, with 7%, 27%  and 47.3% of locations 14 \nfalling in grid square categories 12 - 18, 18 \u2013 24 and 24 \u2013 30 mmol m-2 respectively.  15 \nThe proportion of grid squares with injury falling within the three highest categories 16 \nwas 22% for AOT40 (crop) and 56% for POD3gen (crop).    From Figure 3b, a 17 \nPOD3gen (crop) of 12-18 mmol m-2 can be tentatively interpreted as a threshold for 18 \nlikely occurrence of ozone injury.  Unfortunately, published records of the absence of 19 \nozone symptoms are extremely rare making it impossible from this evidence to 20 \nconfirm this threshold.  21 \n 22 \nVisible injury occurrence in the ICP Vegetation white clover biomonitoring 23 \nexperiments.  24 \nPage 19 of 74 Global Change Biology\n 20 \nOzone injury occurred at almost all sites in the years included in this study (1998 \u2013 1 \n2004), with only 5 of the 52 site\/year combinations recording an absence of injury.   A 2 \nsub-set of sites (28 data points) recorded the first date of ozone injury on NC-S white 3 \nclover. For the 8 days prior to injury appearance or for all days since day 0 of the 4 \nexperiment, the EMEP modelled AOT40 (clover) provided little evidence for a 5 \nthreshold AOT40 value (Figure 4a).  For both time periods, the cumulative frequency 6 \nof percentage of data points increased rapidly with increasing AOT40 (clover), with 7 \n42.9% and 35.7% of data being for AOT40s below 0.1 ppm h (for 8 days and day 0 to 8 \nfirst day of injury, respectively).  A similar pattern existed for AOT30VPD (clover) 9 \n(Figure 4b) with 4 sites recording ozone injury at grid square AOT30VPD of below the 10 \ncritical level of 0.16 ppm h (Italy-Isola Serafini 1999, Italy-Rome 2004, Belgium-11 \nTervuren 2004, UK-Ascot 2004).  In contrast, there was stronger evidence of a 12 \nthreshold for POD3gen (clover) of ca. 3-4 mmol m-2 with 3.5% of data points falling 13 \nbelow 2 mmol m-2, 7.2%  falling between 2 and 3 mmol m-2, and 30.2% falling 14 \nbetween 3 and 4 mmol m-2 for POD3gen (clover) values accumulated for 8 days prior 15 \nto injury (Figure 4c).   16 \n 17 \nThe five-year mean injury score values were superimposed on crop and clover 18 \nAOT40 and POD3gen maps to illustrate the geographical distribution (Figure 5).  The 19 \nAOT40 maps for the two time periods showed similar patterns but AOT40 (clover) 20 \nvalues were larger than AOT40 (crop) values.  Site-specific AOT40 (clover) values, 21 \ndetermined for 84 days from 15 June were higher than AOT40 (crop) values (clover 22 \nAOT40 (clover) = 1.72 * AOT40 (crop), r2 = 0.75, figure not presented) reflecting the 23 \nhigher ozone concentrations in the later months of the clover experiment (mean start 24 \ndates were 33, 35 and 54 days later for ACE, CCE and Med respectively).  POD3gen 25 \nPage 20 of 74Global Change Biology\n 21 \n(clover) values were also higher than POD3gen (crop) values with the region of 1 \nmedium - high fluxes (> 24 mmol m-2) covering larger areas of Europe stretching as 2 \nfar north as southern UK and southern Scandinavia.  Overall, the highest injury scores 3 \non white clover were detected in central and southern Europe, but not all of these sites 4 \ncoincided with the highest mean crop or clover AOT40 values (Figure 5).  In contrast, 5 \nthe injury score data showed a closer correlation with POD3gen with the highest injury 6 \nscores being associated with medium to high\n \nfluxes.  For example, all sites with a 7 \nmean score >1 had an POD3gen (clover) of > 36 mmol m-2.  The corresponding value 8 \nfor AOT40 was an AOT40 (clover)  of 1 ppm h.   9 \n. 10 \n 11 \nEffects on biomass in the ICP Vegetation white clover biomonitoring experiment 12 \nData from 10 countries contributed to this analysis, with the mean normalised % 13 \nbiomass reduction being greatest in Italy (33.3 %, n=10) and Greece (30%, n= 2), 14 \nwith no effects being consistently detected in the UK (Table 4).  For other countries 15 \nthere was a wide range in % biomass reduction reflecting year to year variation in 16 \nAOT40 (clover ) and POD3gen (clover), with maximum reductions being as high as 17 \n25.2 %, 20.8%, and 24.8 % for Austria, Germany and Spain respectively.  The mean 18 \nbiomass reduction per site is shown in Figure 6 for crop and clover AOT40 and 19 \nPOD3gen averaged over the period 2000 \u2013 04.  For both AOT40 (crop) and AOT40 20 \n(clover), mean biomass reductions of > 10% were detected in areas where the 21 \nmodelled AOT40 was below the critical level of 3 ppm h (Figure 6).  By comparison, 22 \nsuch higher mean effects were found in the grid squares with medium \u2013 high fluxes.  23 \n 24 \nPage 21 of 74 Global Change Biology\n 22 \nSite- and year-specific grid values for AOT40 (clover) and AOT40 (crop) were 1 \ncalculated from the EMEP model outputs and plotted against percentage biomass 2 \nreduction (Figure 7).  Not surprisingly there was a lot of scatter in this data (discussed 3 \nlater). Separate plots of the data for sites with modelled AOT40 values that exceeded 4 \nthe critical level of 3 ppm h revealed linear relationships that were significant for 5 \nAOT40(clover) (r2 = 0.58, p <0.001) where data from CCE and MED contributed, but 6 \nnot for AOT40 (crop) (r2=0.28, p=0.179) where only data from MED had an AOT40 7 \nof > 3 ppm h.  However, the relationship for AOT40 (clover) seems to be being 8 \ndriven by the large number of points with an AOT40 of 3 - 4 ppm h, with relatively 9 \nfew points for the higher AOT40 values.  A similar approach was used for POD3gen.  10 \nFor both Figure 8a and Figure 8b there is some indication of a threshold value, above 11 \nwhich ozone effects start to occur consistently.  For POD3gen (clover), this threshold is 12 \nca. 40 mmol m-2; a separate plot of the sub-set of data for POD3gen > 40 shows a 13 \nstrong linear relationship (r2 = 0.58, p <0.001), with data points from ACE and CCE 14 \nwell spread along the regression line.  The relationship between POD3gen (crops) and 15 \nclover biomass reduction was less strong for data points where POD3gen (crops) > 15 16 \nmmol m-2 especially for the higher fluxes, but was significant (r2= 0.21, p=0.002).  17 \n 18 \nFor the 57 data points within the clover biomass dataset, the grid square values were 19 \ncompared for AOT40 (clover) and POD3gen (clover) (Figure 9).  There was a strong 20 \npolynomial relationship between the two parameters (p = 0.93) which could be broken 21 \ndown into region-specific linear relationships.  At low AOT40s, POD3gen was higher 22 \nfor CCE than for ACE presumably indicating climatic conditions that were more 23 \nconducive to ozone uptake.  Between AOT40s of 0 and 3 ppm h, POD3gen for ACE 24 \nincreased more slowly for CCE and MED than for ACE; this slower rate of 25 \nPage 22 of 74Global Change Biology\n 23 \naccumulation of POD3gen per unit AOT40 in CCE and MED continued at the higher 1 \nAOT40s not found in ACE.   2 \n 3 \nDiscussion 4 \nThis study has clearly indicated that many crops and (semi-)natural vegetation 5 \ncommunities are responding to current ambient ozone in Europe.  The most easily 6 \nrecognisable and most commonly reported effect has been the development of 7 \ncharacteristic ozone injury on leaves.   Such effects have been noted every year over 8 \nthe period 1990 \u2013 2006, with over 170 species being reported as having developed 9 \nozone injury.  Injury was reported in each of the five geographical regions of Europe, 10 \nincluding in northern Europe where maps indicate relatively low AOT40.  There is 11 \nalso evidence from the ICP Vegetation clover experiment that ambient ozone 12 \nconcentrations are sufficiently high at several locations in Europe to reduce the 13 \ngrowth of an ozone-sensitive species.    Injury and biomass effects were most 14 \nprevalent in southern European countries, but were also found in central and northern 15 \nEurope.  The results presented here provide significant progress towards identifying 16 \nfield evidence of the improved performance of flux-based compared to concentration-17 \nbased risk maps and provide some justification for the biologists\u2019 preference for flux-18 \nbased approaches (as outlined by Simpson et al., 2007).  They also highlight the 19 \npotential threat to vegetation from future increases in ozone pollution predicted for the 20 \nnear decades. 21 \n  22 \nThe ozone effects data presented here have been subjected to quality assurance 23 \nprocedures in order to reduce uncertainty.  The highest potential source of uncertainty 24 \nwas in the field observations whereby scientists may have wrongly assigned visible 25 \nPage 23 of 74 Global Change Biology\n 24 \ninjury caused by other stresses to ozone pollution.  This was minimised by inclusion 1 \nof observations that were either verified by ozone exposure experiments or recorded 2 \nby experienced ozone-specialist scientists, the latter being the most consistent of 25 3 \nobservers in a quality assurance trial described by Bussotti et al. (2006).  Injury data 4 \nfrom the ICP Vegetation clover experiments were more robust as a common protocol 5 \nwas followed using plant material originating from the same source.  Photographs 6 \nwere provided to guide assessments and the use of a broad range of injury scores 7 \nrather than % injury helped to prevent the problems of under-estimation of damage 8 \ndescribed by Bussotti et al. (2003a).  The NC-S and NC-R biotypes were originally 9 \nselected in the southern-Europe-like climate of North Carolina, USA (Heagle et al., 10 \n1994), but have been extensively employed in many parts of the USA as 11 \nbioindicators.  In the current study, rigorous quality assurance checks (described in 12 \nMills et al., 2000) resulted in exclusion of about one-quarter of the data, including 13 \nsome from northern Europe where the NC-R biotype was sensitive to downy mildew 14 \nin wetter summers. 15 \n 16 \nMuch of the evidence presented here is based on the occurrence of ozone injury on 17 \nthe leaves of sensitive species.   Several authors have argued that visible injury is 18 \nsometimes of little biological significance to the plant in that growth or seed 19 \nproduction are not always reduced by ozone when injury symptoms are present (e.g. 20 \nreview by Bassin et al., 2007).  We tested this argument by comparing lists of species 21 \ninjured by ozone in ambient air with response functions we derived in earlier studies 22 \nfor yield and biomass effects that were based on ozone-exposure experiments (Hayes 23 \net al., 2007a, Mills et al., 2007a).  Of the nine crop species with an AOT40 critical 24 \nlevel of <= 5 ppm h (Mills et al., 2007a), all except cotton and turnip exhibited ozone 25 \nPage 24 of 74Global Change Biology\n 25 \ninjury in the surveys reported here.  Similarly, 5 of the 8 species classified by Mills et 1 \nal. (2007a) as moderately sensitive (maize, sugar beet, potato, tobacco and grapevine) 2 \nwere identified as showing ozone injury in the field whilst no visible effects were 3 \nreported for the crops classified by Mills et al. (2007a) as resistant to ozone.  Of the 4 \nspecies of (semi-)natural vegetation exhibiting injury, 9 were reported by Hayes et al. 5 \n(2007a) as having a relative sensitivity based on biomass effects of <0.9, and 6 had a 6 \nrelative sensitivity of 0.9 \u2013 1.  At the time of the Hayes et al. (2007a) study, there was 7 \nno\/insufficient biomass response data available with which to classify the other 8 \nspecies that are reported here as developing ozone injury in the field. Although data 9 \nfrom injury surveys cannot be directly compared with yield or biomass response data, 10 \nthere is thus clear evidence that those species known to respond negatively to ozone in 11 \nexperiments by either reduced growth or reduced seed production often develop 12 \nozone injury in the field in response to ambient ozone, whilst those known to be 13 \nozone insensitive have not been reported as showing such symptoms.   14 \n 15 \nBefore considering the link between measured effects and modelled ozone exposure it 16 \nis important to consider the uncertainty associated with mapping AOT40 and POD3gen 17 \nwithin the EMEP model.  Both of these indices are sensitive to the characteristics of 18 \nthe frequency distribution of ozone concentrations (Tuovinen et al., 2007, 2009) with 19 \nboth showing increased sensitivity with increasing threshold.  However, as lower 20 \nozone concentrations contribute more to POD3gen than to AOT40 (ca. 7 ppb for the 21 \nPOD3gen (clover) model included here), this parameter is less sensitive to threshold 22 \neffects than AOT40 (LRTAP Convention, 2004, Tuovinen et al., 2007).  Additional 23 \nsources of uncertainty associated with the simulation of the emissions, transport and 24 \ndeposition of ozone and its precursors are described in Simpson et al. (2003a, 2003b, 25 \nPage 25 of 74 Global Change Biology\n 26 \n2007).   Because of the disparity between both the AOT40 (crop) and POD3gen (crop) 1 \naccumulation periods in relation to the timing of the ICP Vegetation experiments 2 \n(which usually start in June, 30 \u2013 55 days after the latitude-derived POD3gen (crop) 3 \naccumulation period starts, for further details, see Hayes et al., (2007b)), and the 4 \nphysical nature of the ICP network (potted plants surrounded by short vegetation), we 5 \ndevised for this study a generic clover flux model for the pot-based clover 6 \nbiomonitoring system (Annex 1).  The higher gmax, lower fmin and higher Tmax for 7 \nPOD3gen (clover) compared to POD3gen (crop), together with the higher ozone 8 \nconcentrations and warmer climate for the mid-June to mid-August period result in 9 \nhigher values for POD3gen (clover) than POD3gen (clover) for the same geographical 10 \nregion.  A major uncertainty in the clover model is the calculation of canopy-height 11 \nozone concentration.  This uncertainty is caused by a number of factors including the 12 \ndense canopy and high stomatal conductance of the potted clover in relation to the 13 \nsurrounding grassland, and the experimental design with pots usually placed on grass 14 \nand being well-spaced out, resulting in an heterogeneous surface roughness that is 15 \ndifficult to model.  The method for calculating ozone concentration provided here for 16 \nthe clover model was thus a first attempt to account for such factors.  It provides a 17 \nconsistent methodology across all sites, but it is impossible to assess any biases 18 \nassociated with the difficulty of modelling ozone concentration.  In addition, the 19 \nclover stomatal conductance parameterisation was generalized to provide one 20 \nparameterisation for the 8 countries contributing data and for the two biotypes (NC-S 21 \nand NC-R).  This introduces some uncertainty into the analysis as within the gs 22 \ndatasets there was some evidence that plants showed variable acclimatisation to local 23 \nconditions (e.g. in cooler climates the stomates show a tendency for closure at lower 24 \nVPDs than in warmer climates, Mills et al., 2003). Unfortunately, the limited range of 25 \nPage 26 of 74Global Change Biology\n 27 \nkey environmental variables measured at individual sites did not allow for climate 1 \nspecific parameterisations to be developed; a generic \u201cpan-European\u201d flux modelling 2 \napproach was selected enabling direct comparison with the crop maps shown.    3 \n 4 \nAt the farm scale, injury-causing ozone episodes can have a catastrophic effect, for 5 \nexample, one farmer in Greece lost a chicory crop worth Euro 15000 as a result of one 6 \nozone episode (Velissariou, pers. comm. and described in more detail in Hayes et al., 7 \n2007b).  Thus, there is a need to develop a method for assessing the risk of such 8 \ncatastrophic effects on a pan-European scale. Although the number of incidences of 9 \nozone injury per area strongly reflects the reporting effort, this study has nevertheless 10 \nshown that ambient ozone over the period 1990 \u2013 2006 induced visible injury on 11 \nozone sensitive species in many parts of Europe, including in northern Europe where 12 \nozone concentrations are generally lower than in central and southern Europe.   Injury 13 \nwas detected in areas where there is a long history of relatively high ozone 14 \nconcentrations and some resistance to ozone has been detected in the field (e.g. 15 \nCentaurea jacea, Bassin et al., 2004, Plantago major, Reiling and Davison, 1992). To 16 \nfully understand the thresholds above which ozone injury occurs, more data is needed 17 \non the conditions that do not lead to ozone injury.  In the absence of such data, we 18 \nhave analysed the data from the ICP Vegetation clover biomonitoring experiment by, 19 \nfor the first time, applying the EMEP model to short-time periods to determine 20 \nwhether exceedance of the modelled AOT30VPD critical level was associated with 21 \noccurrence of visible injury.  For 24 of the 28 data points this was found to be the 22 \ncase.   However, a threshold was more evident for POD3gen (clover), with a rapid 23 \nincrease in incidences of ozone injury for values between 2 and 3 mmol m-2 for the 8 24 \ndays prior to injury and from day 0 to injury.  Using either index, the EMEP model 25 \nPage 27 of 74 Global Change Biology\n 28 \ncould be used to predict for current and future ozone conditions the frequency of 1 \ninjury-causing episodes.  Such maps and data could be used to assess the risk of 2 \ndamage to leafy vegetable crops, the economic value of which depends on the 3 \nappearance of the leaf.    4 \n 5 \nWe tested here the efficacy of the AOT40-based critical level for crops using the 6 \nclover biomass data and the EMEP modelled data for AOT40. Whether AOT40 was 7 \ncalculated for the crop growth period or the clover growth period, ca. 40% of sites had 8 \na > 10% biomass reduction in NC-S at modelled AOT40 values below the critical 9 \nlevel of 3 ppm h.  For both accumulation periods, a relatively small number of points 10 \nfor higher effects at high AOT40 values led to a significant linear relationship 11 \nbetween AOT40 and % biomass reduction above the current critical level.  12 \nFurthermore, there was widespread occurrence of visible injury in grid squares that 13 \nwere below the critical level for yield reduction.  Although, as already discussed, the 14 \nlatter cannot necessarily be equated with an effect of biological significance to the 15 \nplant, when taken with the biomass reduction data such widespread occurrence does 16 \ntend to suggest that the AOT40-based critical level is insufficiently robust for 17 \npredicting the damaging effects of ozone on vegetation in Europe.  This approach to 18 \nmapping risk could possibly be improved by (1) using a different cut-off value instead 19 \nof 40 ppb as correlations between ozone injury and locally measured ozone 20 \nconcentrations were improved in both Spain and Sweden when 20 and 30 ppb were 21 \nused as the cut-off values (Ribas and Penuelas, 2003, Pihl Karlsson et al., 2004); and 22 \n(2) using species-specific time intervals that better captured the time of damaging 23 \nozone episodes as tested here for the AOT40 (clover) model. 24 \n 25 \nPage 28 of 74Global Change Biology\n 29 \nIn contrast to the AOT40 maps, the risk maps based on the flux parameter, POD3gen, 1 \nprovided a better representation of the areas where ozone effects occurred for all four 2 \ntypes of effect data.  Flux-effect relationships were improved when a species-specific 3 \nmodel (POD3gen (clover)) was used.  These important results are supported by locally 4 \nparameterised flux models for sites in, for example, Spain (Filella et al., 2005) and 5 \nItaly (Fagnano and Merola, 2007).  They are also supported by analyses of data from 6 \nearly ICP Vegetation experiments that identified the importance of locally measured 7 \nconductance modifying factors such as VPD and rainfall as contributory factors for 8 \nthe response to ozone (Benton et al., 2000; Ball et al., 2000).   Further support for the 9 \nimproved performance of POD3gen maps compared to AOT40 maps comes from the 10 \nmany locations in Germany, The Netherlands and Sweden where ozone effects were 11 \nnoted in grid squares predicted to have relatively low AOT40 (crop) (< 3 ppm h) but 12 \nmid-range POD3gen (crop) (18 - 30 mmol m-2).   This paper presents some evidence to 13 \nsupport critical levels for POD3gen (clover) of ca. 40 - 50 mmol m-2 for biomass 14 \neffects and ca. 3 mmol m-2 for appearance of visible injury, but these would need to 15 \nbe tested further with site-specific measured data.  Since data from ACE, CCE and 16 \nMED are contributing to the response function shown in Figure (9d), it can be 17 \nconcluded that it is appropriate to combine data sets from the different regions of 18 \nEurope for the derivation of a flux-based critical level for Europe-wide application.   19 \n 20 \nConclusion 21 \nOur study has provided evidence that ambient concentrations of the pollutant ozone 22 \nhave repeatedly induced damage to vegetation across 17 European countries during 23 \nthe period 1990 to 2006.  Species exhibiting visible injury in the field match those 24 \nidentified in exposure experiments to be sufficiently sensitive to ozone to have 25 \nPage 29 of 74 Global Change Biology\n 30 \nreduced biomass or yield at concentrations within the European range of ozone 1 \nconcentrations.   Biomass reductions have been found in ambient air for the sentinel 2 \nbioindicator species, Trifolium repens.  Unfortunately, data records compiled for this 3 \nstudy were too inconsistent for identification of long-term trends in effects in response 4 \nto the changing ozone profile.  Overall, flux-based risk maps were better predictors of 5 \nthe areas where ozone damage occurred than AOT40\u2013based risk maps, with 6 \npredictive ability improving for time-period accumulation and effect data matched 7 \nmaps.  In many areas of Europe (e.g. Belgium, northern Germany, southern Sweden) 8 \nthere is evidence of effects where AOT40 values (crop and clover) are predicted to be 9 \nlow, whilst ozone flux (crop and clover) is moderate to high due to the climatic 10 \nconditions being conducive to high stomatal uptake.  Thus, this study provides 11 \nimportant validation data to provide support to the use of the biologically more 12 \nmeaningful flux-based approach for risk assessment.  13 \n 14 \nThe most disconcerting outcome of this study is that the current ambient ozone 15 \nclimate of Europe is already having extensive impacts on vegetation across Europe. 16 \nSince ozone damage has also been detected in other parts of the world including the 17 \nUSA (e.g. Bennett et al., 2006, Davis & Orendovici, 2006, Booker et al., 2009) and 18 \nsouth-east Asia (Emberson et al., 2009), the problem appears to be global.   Even with 19 \nimplementation of current legislation, ozone concentrations are predicted to continue 20 \nto rise across most of the world over the coming decades (Royal Society, 2008) and 21 \nthus it is likely that ozone impacts on vegetation will worsen.  Indeed, the Royal 22 \nSociety report (2008) predicted that by 2030, tropospheric ozone pollution could pose 23 \nas big a threat to global food security as climate change.   Thus, there is an urgent 24 \nglobal need for coordinated effort to reduce the emissions of the precursors of ozone 25 \nPage 30 of 74Global Change Biology\n 31 \npollution to benefit security of food supplies, improve human health and help reduce 1 \nglobal warming.   2 \n 3 \nAcknowledgements 4 \nWe would like to thank the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 5 \n(Contract AQ03509) and the LRTAP Convention Trust Fund for funding this work.  6 \nWe would like to thank over 80 participants in the ICP Vegetation for providing data 7 \nfor use in this study, and would specifically like to thank the following people for 8 \ntheir contributions: Maria Sanz,  Marco Ferretti and others (ICP Forests), J\u00fcrgen 9 \nBender (Germany), Costas Saitanis and Dimitris Velissariou (Greece), Cristina Nali, 10 \nAlessandra Francini, Elisa Pellegrini, Valentina Picchi (Italy), Franc Bati\u010d and Boris 11 \nTurk (Slovenia), Viki Bermejo and Ben Gimeno (Spain), H\u00e5kan Pleijel and Per Erik 12 \nKarlsson (Sweden).

The estimation of ozone flux to the ICP clover biomonitors.  1 \n 2 \nThe procedures specified in the Modelling and Mapping Manual (LRTAP 3 \nConvention, 2004) for calculating PODY (described as AFstY in LRTAP Convention, 4 \n2004) or indeed AOTX, and implemented in the EMEP chemical transport model 5 \n(Simpson et al., 2003), have been designed on the assumption that the vegetation in 6 \nquestion provides a homogeneous canopy (`big-leaf'), so that vertical O3 gradients 7 \nabove the canopy can be derived with standard turbulence profiles (Tuovinen et al., 8 \n2009). 9 \n 10 \nThe ICP Vegetation biomonitoring programme consists of potted clover plants, sitting 11 \nabove a short vegetation (or bare-soil) surface, surrounded usually by grassland or 12 \nother low vegetation. Such a situation is theoretically difficult to model, and does not 13 \nconform to the assumptions of the Modelling and Mapping Manual methods. The O3 14 \nconcentration impinging on the upper leaves of these clover plants will be affected 15 \nmore by the characteristics of the surrounding vegetation than of the clover plants 16 \nthemselves.  To generate a flux-estimate for potted clover (Fst(clover)) which accounts 17 \nfor this situation, we calculate  18 \n 19 \nFst(clover) = O3(grass) . gsto(clover) 20 \n 21 \nwhere gsto(clover) is the effective stomatal conductance of clover found by applying 22 \nthe DO3SE model, using the NC-S\/NC-R parameterisation derived as described below 23 \nand presented in Table 5. O3(grass) is the O3 concentration found at the top of a grass 24 \ncanopy, estimated using the grassland parameterisation from the standard EMEP 25 \nmodel (Simpson et al., 2003). The effective stomatal conductance represents that 26 \nfraction of the O3 flux entering via the stomata, as opposed to that lost through 27 \nPage 48 of 74Global Change Biology\n 49 \ndeposition to the external leaf surface. The relation between these terms is discussed 1 \nin Tuovinen et al., (2009).  2 \n 3 \nThe gsto(clover) model uses the following formulation based on the stomatal 4 \nconductance algorithm described in the Modelling and Mapping Manual, see LRTAP 5 \nConvention (2004) for further details. 6 \n 7 \ngsto(clover) = gmax * fphen * flight * max {fmin, (ftemp * fVPD * fSWP)}  8 \n 9 \nThe gsto(clover) model is parameterized to represent a hybrid NC-S\/NC-R clover plant 10 \nbased on a dataset described in Mills et al. (2003) that includes over 5000 stomatal 11 \nconductance measurements made at nine sites in Europe from 1998 \u2013 2000 (Austria- 12 \nSeibersdorf, Belgium-Tervuren, Germany-Essen, Germany-Trier, Italy-Milan, Italy-13 \nRome, Spain-Ebro Delta, Sweden-Gothenburg, UK-Bangor).  Data was supplied by G 14 \nMills, P B\u00fcker, F Hayes, W Werner, B Gimeno, I Fumagalli, B K\u00f6llner, F Manes, G Pihl 15 \nKarlsson, G. Soja and K Vandermeiren. 16 \n 17 \ngmax and fmin 18 \ngmax is derived from the 90th percentile and gmin from the 10th percentile values of the 19 \nentire NC-S and NC-R stomatal conductance dataset. gmax was converted from a 20 \nconductance for water vapour (H2O) to a conductance for O3 using a ratio of 0.662 21 \nbased on the diffusivities of H2O to O3 in air after Massman (1998).This gave a value 22 \nof 532 mmol O3 m-2 s-1 for the mean of the two biotypes. The fmin is expressed as a 23 \nfraction of gmax.  All values are shown in Table A1. 24 \n 25 \nBoundary line derivation for flight, ftemp and fVPD 26 \nFor the derivation of flight, ftemp and fVPD relationships a boundary line approach was 27 \nused. This method defined the 90th percentile values of stomatal conductance within 28 \ndifferent incremental classes of environmental data which were: 100 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 for 29 \nPage 49 of 74 Global Change Biology\n 50 \nflight; 2oC for ftemp and 0.1 kPa for fVPD.  Figure A1 shows the resulting boundary lines, 1 \nfitted by eye, for each biotype of clover using the generic functions described in the 2 \nMapping Manual (LRTAP Convention, 2004).  To derive the NC-S\/NC-R 3 \nparameterization, mean values (i.e. the mean of the co-efficient for flight and means of 4 \nthe threshold values for ftemp and fVPD) were calculated from the individual biotypes; 5 \nall values are presented in Table A1.  Note: for fVPD, data classes with fewer than 10 6 \ndata points were used to guide the derivation for high VPDs; these are denoted by 7 \ngrey shading in the figures. 8 \n 9 \nThe gsto(clover) model assumes that fphen  and fSWP are both equal to 1. This maintains 10 \nconsistency with the crop generic flux model (LRTAP Convention, 2004).  11 \n 12 \nTable A1 Parameterisation for the NC-S and NC-R clover clones and the hybrid NC-13 \nS\/NC-R clover clone used to parameterise the gsto(clover) model. 14 \n 15 \n NC-S  NC-R  Combined NC-\nS\/NC-R values \nused  \ngmax (mmol O3 \nm-2 PLA s-1) \n534 527 530 \ngmin 0.12 0.09 0.105 \nflight -0.02 -0.018 -0.019 \nTmin -5 8 1 \nTopt 27 30 28 \nTmax 59 52 55 \nVPDmax 3.7 4.3 4 \nVPDmin 7.54 7.05 7.30 \n 16 \n 17 \n 18 \n 19 \n 20 \nPage 50 of 74Global Change Biology\n 51 \n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0 500 1000 1500 2000\nf lig\nht\nIrradiance (\u00b5mol m-2 s-1)\nflight relationship for NC-S clover clone\n \n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0 500 1000 1500 2000\nf lig\nht\nIrradiance (\u00b5mol m-2 s-1)\nflight relationship for NC-R clover clone\n 1 \n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nf te\nm\np\nTemperature (oC)\nftemp relationship for NC-S clover clone\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nf te\nm\np\nTemperature (oC)\nftemp relationship for NC-R clover clone\n 2 \n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0 2 4 6 8\nf V\nPD\nVPD (kPa)\nfVPD relationship for NC-S clover clone\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nf V\nPD\nVPD (kPa)\nfVPD relationship for NC-R clover clone\n 3 \n 4 \nFigure A1.
